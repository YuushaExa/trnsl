    "content": "Splashing a handful of water onto his face, Zhou Ze slowly lifted his head and looked at himself in the mirror. He was a bit haggard—for an ER doctor, that kind of exhaustion was practically part of the uniform.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is on the way! Looks like they fell from an upper floor—not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted, standing at the door to the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'm coming,\" Zhou Ze responded. He pulled out a paper towel, wiped the water from his face, and started heading out.\n\nThe ambulance soon pulled into the hospital. On the gurney lay an old man dressed in a gray Tang suit. He was coughing nonstop, occasionally spitting up bloody foam and fragments of what looked like his spleen. His entire body was covered in blood.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over. While pushing the gurney, he observed the patient's condition and shouted to the people ahead, \"Prep the surgical instruments, now!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was critical.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, fixed on Zhou Ze, the person closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you're going to be okay. We'll help you. You're not going to die.\"\n\nMost dying patients say things like this. Few people can truly face death with calm. As a doctor, this wasn't the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell him his odds of survival. What the patient needed right now was psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... Below... below... It's... it's truly terrifying down below...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly seized Zhou Ze's wrist, his face grim as he stared at him.\n\n\"Please try to calm down. Relax. Your life is not in danger.\" Although his wrist throbbed with a sharp pain, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want to... don't want to go back down... They... they found me... I... They found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a piercing pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" a young nurse beside him cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were long. And for some unknown reason, they were black—a translucent, amber-like black, not the kind that comes from accumulated grime.\n\nAnd now, the old man's fingernails had dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... haha... *cough cough cough*...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat bolt upright, coughing violently. Then, his body shuddered. The hand gripping Zhou Ze's wrist went limp, and he fell back, motionless.\n\n\"Prepare to resuscitate!\" Zhou Ze yelled.\n\nThe old man was rushed into the emergency room, where doctors and nurses began resuscitation procedures. The defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me take care of that wound for you,\" Wang Ya said, walking over.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about a minor flesh wound. Their greatest fear was the risk of professional exposure—if the old man had some other disease. After all, his hands had just been covered in blood, and no one knew if he was carrying something contagious.\n\nContracting certain diseases could ruin a person's life.\n\nAfter his wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the ER and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nIt meant the man hadn't made it.\n\nEveryone's spirits sank, but for them, this was a common occurrence. They would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, you should get checked out,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the locker room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and drove away.\n\nJust as he drove under the Jianghai Avenue overpass, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Principal Wu. A patient held me up. I'm on my way now. Please ask the children to wait just a little longer for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The person on the other end hung up quickly.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green. Zhou Ze stepped on the gas and drove forward.\n\n\"BEEEEEEEEEP!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAt that very moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran the red light and came straight at him. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and see the blinding high beams through his window.\n\nThen,\n\n*CRUNCH!*\n\nThe world spun.\n\nIn front of the heavy truck, the small car was like a flimsy piece of paper, sent flying. It flipped several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze regained consciousness.\n\nHe found he couldn't move his body at all, as if he were pinned.\n\nAt the same time, he couldn't open his eyes. He knew he'd been in a car crash, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he wanted to check his injuries, but he was completely immobilized.\n\nAll around him were the sounds of other cars driving past, and various horns honking.\n\n*Am I still at the crash site?*\n\n*Am I still in the car?*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of police sirens arrived, along with fire truck sirens.\n\nFinally, the familiar sound of an ambulance siren reached him.\n\nZhou Ze could feel his body being moved. The temperature nearby was slightly high; they must be cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations; he was familiar with the procedures.\n\nWhat a shame. The cake in his trunk, and the June 1st Children's Day party for the orphanage kids, would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh in his mind. At least he had survived. This was, he supposed, a disaster that had come out of nowhere.\n\nHe could hear the voices of a few nurses nearby, but it was too noisy to make them out clearly.\n\nBut the next thing Dr. Chen said sent Zhou Ze's heart plunging into an abyss.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has no vital signs.\"\n\n*No.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*I'M NOT DEAD!!*\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his mind.\n\nHe wasn't dead. He was still conscious. He wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He could feel those heavy, rhythmic compressions, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nHe hoped they would realize he wasn't dead soon!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the weeping of several nurses he knew.\n\nDr. Chen slammed his fist on a nearby car door, clearly grief-stricken.\n\n*Hey!*\n\n*Don't give up!*\n\n*Please don't give up!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I must be in a state of suspended animation.*\n\n*Massive blood loss?*\n\n*Severe injuries?*\n\n*But I'm really not dead!*\n\n*I should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!*\n\nZhou Ze roared furiously in his mind.\n\nBut then, he felt himself being lifted onto a gurney and, presumably, moved into the ambulance.\n\nNext came the sound of the ambulance driving off.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut to Zhou Ze's ears, their sobs were exceptionally grating.\n\nHe wasn't dead yet.\n\nWhat were they crying for!\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\n*Look at me again.*\n\n*Look at me again.*\n\n*Check one more time.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the voice of a hospital administrator:\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone, just like that?\"\n\n\"The crash was severe. Dr. Zhou's injuries were too extensive, he lost too much blood. Death has been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone?\" Another vice president sounded incredulous.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone,\" said a department head. \"I just checked him again myself.\"\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You incompetent fools!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bastards!*\n\n*Bastards!*\n\nZhou Ze cursed them endlessly in his mind. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, no longer his friends, and certainly not his superiors or elders.\n\nThey had actually declared him dead.\n\nBut can a dead person still hear voices and have sensations?\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bastards.*\n\n*You animals.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\nThe gurney started moving. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Little Ya, don't be so sad. The president said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it. A person, just gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he be gone just like that.\"\n\n\"The heavens are unpredictable; fortune and misfortune can strike at any moment. You just have to try and accept it.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty.\n\nThat chilling cold,\n\nwas so distinct.\n\nZhou Ze struggled relentlessly, trying to fight back. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current state felt like sleep paralysis; no matter how hard he tried, his body was completely beyond his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nhe gave up, somewhat in despair.\n\nHe was tired.\n\nExhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now.\n\nIn the hospital's...\n\nmorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke\" again, it was to a faint, cool sensation on his face. The stinging was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done yet?\" someone asked from the side.\n\n\"Don't rush me. Hold on. He was mangled this badly in the crash, how can the makeup be done so quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital people are pushing us. They need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it, then?\"\n\nThe mortuary cosmetologist seemed a bit annoyed and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, her clients were the dead, and the dead certainly wouldn't complain of pain, nor did she have to worry about receiving a complaint. She just needed to produce a result for the living to see.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nenduring the stinging pain as the makeup brush pressed repeatedly against his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt his clothes being changed. Then, he was pushed out. Hospital orderlies lifted him and placed him into a soft, narrow space.\n\nThis...\n\nmust be a refrigerated coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly cut off.\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nrocking,\n\nbumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The coffin lid must have been opened.\n\nWhat filled his ears,\n\nwas a funeral dirge.\n\nThe hospital president was giving a speech at a microphone, praising him, lamenting his loss.\n\nThen came the vice president, the department heads, and so on.\n\nAround him,\n\nthe sound of footsteps walked past from time to time.\n\nSome people just walked past quietly, taking one last look at him.\n\nSome even tried to call his name a few times, their voices choked with tears.\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\n*A viewing...*\n\n*of my remains!*\n\n*I'm not dead.*\n\n*I'm really not dead.*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his mind.\n\nHe started trying to fight again.\n\nBut it was still useless.\n\nHe could only hear, and he could feel,\n\nbut he couldn't speak,\n\nand he couldn't open his eyes.\n\nEveryone was convinced he was dead.\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nhe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage came, too, crying beside him.\n\nTheir tears were sincere. Because Zhou Ze himself was a child who had come out of that orphanage. For that reason, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to it. This car accident had happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage at night to celebrate June 1st Children's Day with the kids.\n\n\"Little Zhou, you can go in peace. This time, it can be considered a work-related incident. You don't have any family, but the hospital will give your compensation money to the orphanage. You can rest assured,\" the vice president said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being sealed off again. The lid of the refrigerated coffin must have been closed once more.\n\nThen another bumpy ride.\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe coffin lid was opened again.\n\nIt was quiet all around, with only the occasional human voice, not loud at all.\n\nTwo people, one grabbing his shoulders and the other his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which felt like a steel plate.\n\nThese two were practiced, very, very practiced.\n\nIn the background, there were faint, sparse sobs.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't figure out where he had been brought this time.\n\nBut at that moment,\n\nhe suddenly understood.\n\n*You sons of bitches!*\n\n*They've sent me to the crematorium!*\n\n*They're going to burn me!*\n\n*I'm not dead, you sons of bitches!*\n\n*Fuck your ancestors!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*Don't cremate me.*\n\n*Don't cremate me!*\n\n*I'M REALLY NOT DEAD YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*\n\n*You animals.*\n\n*You bastards!*\n\n*You sons of bitches!!!!!*\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was more frantic than ever, more insane than ever.\n\nHe knew,\n\nonce he was cremated,\n\nthere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would be facing death directly!\n\nA complete and total end!\n\nHe was unwilling. He was truly unwilling. He wasn't even thirty yet, he hadn't started a family, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long road ahead of him!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw that uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice piped up from the side.\n\n*Smack!* A hand slapped the child's face.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nBecause no matter how he struggled,\n\nno matter how he roared in his mind,\n\nthe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started up.\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face.\n\nAnd because of that, he was terrified beyond measure!\n\n*No.*\n\n*No.*\n\n*No!*\n\n*I'm not dead, I'm really not dead!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\nNo one could hear his cries.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad.\n\nOnly responsible for grieving.\n\nOnly responsible for seeing this process through.\n\nAnd then they would go home, eat dinner, and carry on with their lives tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being pushed into a narrow space that reeked of grease and soot.\n\nNext,\n\na sticky liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what it was.\n\nGasoline.\n\nNext,\n\n*Sssss...*\n\nHot!\n\nExtremely hot!\n\nPain.\n\nIntense, burning pain!\n\nFire.\n\nFire.\n\nA great fire.\n\nFire everywhere...",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

    "content": "On a midnight street,\n\nThe streetlights cast a yellow glow,\n\nAnd people, too, were filled with unease.\n\nThe weather was cold, and the wind cut like a knife.\n\nZhou Ze felt the cold, too.\n\nHe didn't know where this place was,\n\nBut he knew one thing:\n\nThis was... the mortal world.\n\nHe had already died, but he had come back.\n\nHe didn't know what he should do.\n\nHe could only continue walking forward, mechanically numb.\n\nRight now, he wasn't in the mood to think about much else.\n\nNot the place he had just been \"down below.\"\n\nNot the old man he had treated right before his car accident.\n\nNot the faceless woman in the red dress by the pond.\n\nNot... his own fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyful event. But even when people occasionally passed by, no matter how hard he tried to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe had been ostracized by this world, cut off from it.\n\nSomeone who has never been put in \"solitary confinement\" cannot understand the pain of complete isolation. And for Zhou Ze, the entire world was now his cage, a cage covered with a black cloth.\n\nNo one could see him.\n\nNo one could communicate with him.\n\nHe couldn't pick up a single solid object.\n\nEven,\n\nThe wind could blow right through him with ease.\n\nHe was so frail.\n\nThe phrase \"too weak to withstand the wind\" was, for him, no exaggeration at all.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and terrified Zhou Ze the most was that,\n\nHe could see faint specks of light continuously drifting away from his body.\n\nIn other words,\n\nHis body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would disappear completely, the last insignificant trace of him wiped away.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this was happening, but he knew his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron-Crutch Li entered the body of a man who had starved to death on the ground as a soul, thus becoming the figure known in later legends.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to revive the soul.\" He wanted to borrow a corpse, too. He was cold and panicked; he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nHe didn't even care who the person was.\n\nAt times like these, people are always selfish. Zhou Ze was no exception. Besides, he really couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he tried to approach someone, flames of light would appear above their head and on their shoulders, making it impossible for him to get close. The attempt even caused him harm, accelerating the rate of his \"evaporation.\"\n\nHe was a little tired, a little numb.\n\nHe was waiting for his end.\n\nWaiting for his conclusion.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death a second time actually allowed him to be a bit more composed.\n\nBesides, in Zhou Ze's current state, the longer he lingered here, the longer his torment would last.\n\n*Creak...*\n\nAhead, there was a shop with its lights still on. It seemed to be a bookstore, as he could see rows of shelves through the glass door.\n\nSomeone pushed the door open from the inside and walked out. It was a man in a hoodie. He wore a hat, obscuring his face. After glancing around, he hurried away.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nInitially, Zhou Ze didn't think anything was amiss. But not long after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm presence from within the bookstore.\n\nYes,\n\nA warm presence.\n\nThis warmth was baffling to Zhou Ze, but right now, he was like a man freezing to death who had suddenly found a box of matches. Even if he knew the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike one, just to feel a final moment of warmth before he died.\n\nZhou Ze walked over. His body passed directly through the bookstore's glass door. He continued inside, arriving behind the bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\n\nLay a person.\n\nIt was a young man with handsome features, probably only twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the shop, he wasn't wearing much—just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\n\nHe was lying on the floor, but from him, Zhou Ze sensed a feeling of warmth, like a penniless man who had found a bag of gold coins while walking on the street at night.\n\nThis attraction was impossible to refuse, and the current Zhou Ze was in no position to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of the young man.\n\nHe didn't know how to enter the other's body, but he understood how to make contact with the warmth he so desperately needed.\n\nHe reached out a hand and placed it on the man's chest.\n\nZhou Ze saw his own fingernails slowly embed themselves into the other's body.\n\nIt was a very strange sensation. Unlike the \"light breeze\" that had passed through his body on the street earlier, this was a merging, a fusion using his fingernails as a medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other's body. The two of them began to overlap.\n\n...\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up for me!\"\n\nZhou Ze was awakened by a series of shoves. No, more accurately, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his head having been resting on his arms.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp and shrill, carrying a tone of imperious command.\n\nLifting his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, more accurately, she was a girl, probably high school age. Though she was a big girl, she still had a touch of childishness about her.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what is your problem? You think you're hot stuff now, huh? Giving my parents and my sister an attitude? You actually dared to not come home all night!\n\nWho gave you the nerve!\"\n\nXu Le?\n\nWho was that?\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands in a daze. They were smooth. His old hands had calluses from long hours of practicing with surgical instruments, but these hands had none.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slammed her hand on the counter, looking furious.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection—a stranger's face. No, he had seen this face before. It was the face he had seen last night.\n\nThis body...\n\nIs mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what's your deal? My parents are both angry, and my mom's throwing a fit at home. Let me tell you, the food you eat, the drinks you drink, everything you use belongs to my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\n\nWho are you trying to make a statement to!\n\nIf you dare not come home again tonight, believe it or not, I'll come over here and slap you!\"\n\nThe girl raised her hand as if to strike, but she suddenly noticed that the man in front of her—her \"brother-in-law\"—wasn't flinching or begging for mercy like he usually did. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\n\nJust then, she glanced at the time and saw it was already seven-thirty.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school. I'll deal with you tonight!\"\n\nThe girl stormed out angrily.\n\nZhou Ze, however, slowly sat back down in the chair behind his counter. There was an old laptop here, and a cell phone next to it.\n\nEven now, he still hadn't adjusted to this change in identity.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng. And he was an orphan.\n\nAnd now,\n\nHe had become this person.\n\nWhat did that girl just say?\n\nI'm... a live-in son-in-law?\n\nI have a wife?\n\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nAnd judging by the tone and attitude his little sister-in-law just used with her \"brother-in-law,\" it seemed his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly followed the fine traditions of ancient times.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, colloquially known as one who marries into the bride's family, was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but, in ancient times, would be looked down upon by everyone. Their status was almost equivalent to that of a criminal; during the Han and Tang dynasties, men forced into military service at the frontiers often included live-in sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up the phone. There was no password set. He didn't know if the previous owner was lazy or just didn't dare to set one. At least, it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThe QQ contact list was very sparse, just a few junior high, high school, and university classmates. Then there was a \"Family\" group with only one person in it, labeled \"Wife.\"\n\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her. Empty.\n\nAlright then.\n\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and, after a bit of searching, found the contact labeled \"Wife.\" Here, there were replies. It was mostly Xu Le asking things, like what's for dinner tonight, what preparations are needed for tonight, how much money is needed for restocking, how much the bookstore has made recently, how is your health, and a whole heap of other things.\n\nAnd her replies were often perfunctory and cold.\n\nConsisting of:\n\n\"Oh\"\n\n\"Mm\"\n\n\"Okay\"\n\nTo stand in for everything else.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. These interpersonal relationships were a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm. His fingernails looked no different from a normal person's.\n\nBut the old man he treated before the car crash, his escape from the faceless woman, his entry into this guy's body—on all these occasions, his fingernails had played a crucial role.\n\nHis mind willed it.\n\nAnd just at that moment,\n\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails begin to slowly lengthen. At the same time, they became pitch-black and translucent. A faint black mist even swirled around them.\n\n\"Hooo...\"\n\nHe let out a long breath.\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\nWhen he opened them again,\n\nHis fingernails were back to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there trying to adapt to his new identity, also calming the sense of unease brought on by the transition. He didn't even eat lunch, either because he forgot or because he simply didn't feel hungry.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in the Chongchuan District, and now he was in the Gangzha District. They weren't far apart.\n\nIt wasn't until the afternoon that Zhou Ze sighed and silently stood up. Since he was here, he might as well accept it.\n\nHe started trying to dust the bookshelves, at the very least, to find something to do.\n\nThe words of the old man who had choked him before dying—\"He's been discovered\"—and what the faceless woman in hell had said—\"You'll be caught sooner or later\"—created a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nHis current state was one of \"living on borrowed time.\" To be resurrected from death was a stroke of heavenly luck, so he cherished it. At least, before he fully understood the situation and had enough clues, he had to live out this role. It was best not to cause too much of a disturbance, not to attract the attention of those \"who want to catch him.\"\n\nBusiness at this shop was truly terrible. The slump in the traditional book market had been going on for a long time, and this place wasn't on some prime real estate street right outside a school.\n\nOne could only say that for \"Xu Le\" to have chosen to open a bookstore here, whether he could even break even was a question.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that today's first customer walked in.\n\nThe customer wandered around the elementary school reader section and stayed there for a very long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited a while, then finally walked over and asked, \"What subject are you looking for?\"\n\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't know much about it either.\n\n\"Just looking,\" the person replied.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze didn't bother him further. He hadn't yet settled into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut just then,\n\nThe person suddenly walked up behind him and spoke ominously:\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night, I hit you over the head with a baseball bat and robbed you.\n\nAnd I even went back to check.\n\nYou were clearly no longer breathing then.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned. So, the only reason he’d been able to possess the body of this \"Xu Le\" and reanimate last night was because the man had just been murdered?\n\nHe could only get in because the body was still warm?\n\nLooked at that way, he was actually quite lucky.\n\nThere was no revulsion, no anger, and certainly no panic at the thought of his identity being exposed. Zhou Ze turned and looked at the man behind him, who was about his own age.\n\nThe man froze.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy.\n\nIt was relief.\n\nAnd even…\n\na little bit of appreciation.\n\nAs a soul in need of a host, Zhou Ze knew exactly how dire his situation had been last night. If this guy hadn't happened to kill someone at that precise moment, his own soul might have been scattered to the winds, never to see today's sun.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night. When I woke up this morning, my head felt awful, like I was drunk. I've forgotten what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the man would guess he was a ghost who had possessed a corpse, unless the guy had water on the brain.\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The man pointed to his own nose, finding the situation absurd. \"Even after I told you I clocked you from behind yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine. In fact, thank you for not taking the phone and computer from my desk.\"\n\n\"Uh... I forgot,\" the man said, scratching his head. \"It's good that you're okay. This is the money I robbed from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then fumbled around and pulled out another eight hundred.\n\n\"The eight hundred is for your medical bills, the three hundred is what I stole.\" The man pursed his lips. \"Yesterday, I gambled away my whole salary to some online bookie. I was passing by your bookstore and suddenly got the idea to get some quick cash. After I knocked you down, I realized you weren't breathing. I was scared to death.\n\n\"I ran home and couldn't sleep all night, just thinking the police would break down my door and arrest me. Home invasion, robbery, and murder... all for three hundred yuan. I felt so stupid, so not worth it.\"\n\nThe man clapped Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\n\"Buddy, it's so good you're not dead. Really. I've been lurking outside since this morning, waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for them to show up. Then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\n\"You know? At that moment, I could have knelt down and kowtowed to you. Thank you. You're tough, you didn't die. Otherwise, I'd be finished. With all these cameras around, I definitely wouldn't have gotten away if you'd died.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, then at the \"murderer\" before him, tearfully repenting. The whole scene felt bizarre.\n\nTo be honest, \"Xu Le\" *was* dead. Because he died, Zhou Ze had been able to usurp his place. And because he had usurped his place, the man before him was spared a murder charge.\n\nHe and the man before him had both profited. Only Xu Le was the poor, unlucky bastard.\n\n\"Alright, it's over. I probably just got the wind knocked out of me last night.\" Zhou Ze moved the man's hand off his shoulder. He used to be an emergency room doctor; what kind of filth hadn't he seen? Yet, in that extreme environment, he had developed a bit of an obsession with cleanliness. In fact, most ER doctors have some degree of mysophobia. It's precisely because they've witnessed so much filth and grime that they cherish \"cleanliness\" all the more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" the man asked, delighted.\n\n\"No, I don't blame you.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Go on, get back to work and live your life. Just don't make the same mistake again.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy. You're a real stand-up guy.\"\n\nThe man nodded emphatically, left the bookstore, and went off to embrace his \"new life.\"\n\nZhou Ze, however, picked up his phone. He thought for a moment and decided he should still call the police—not to report the man for murdering him (Xu Le), but to report him for suspected theft.\n\nLet the police investigate. If the man had a prior record or had committed other crimes and got caught, he deserved it.\n\nHe had occupied the man's body; he ought to do something for the unlucky bastard.\n\nAlthough, to report him by name after the guy had shown such a good attitude of remorse and even paid medical fees, was a pretty despicable thing to do, the kind of thing that makes you *give birth to a son with no asshole*, so to speak.¹\n\nJust then, as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the operator's voice came on the line,\n\nat the shop entrance,\n\nthe man suddenly returned.\n\n\"One more thing...\" The man had just walked in when he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He froze, then pointed a finger straight at Zhou Ze. \"You son of a bitch, you were still going to call the police, weren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone, give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You went back on your word, you bastard! I'll fucking kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly flew into an agitated, frenzied state. He likely had some minor mental issues, probably from a life of gambling that had disconnected him from society. He was prone to extremism when triggered by certain events.\n\nThe man lunged, and Zhou Ze dropped his phone, backing away.\n\nHe had been a doctor in his previous life, not a boxer or a martial artist. This body was also quite frail. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was genuinely flustered.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe man slammed Zhou Ze against the wall, his hands clamping tightly around Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I'll teach you to call the police! I'll teach you to go back on your word! Fine, I'll make you die, really die! This time I'll strangle you and then bleed you out! Let's see if you're still not dead then!\" the man roared, gnashing his teeth.\n\nBusiness at the bookstore was pitifully slow. In the afternoon, forget customers, there were barely any pedestrians outside.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. In the process, his fingernails suddenly grew long and turned black.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his arms around the man's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shuddered, his eyes rolled back, and he let go of Zhou Ze's neck. He staggered back a few steps, knocking over several bookshelves before collapsing to the floor with a thud.\n\nFreed, Zhou Ze rubbed his neck. He hadn't actually been that panicked. After all, his nails could harm even the vicious ghosts of Hell; dealing with an ordinary person shouldn't be much of a problem, right?\n\nBut as for the specific reason for these nails or what their use was, Zhou Ze wasn't entirely clear yet. He only knew they were probably \"transmitted\" to him by the old man he had saved before his car accident.\n\nIt really was like that old jingle: *get one fungal nail, and it'll infect two.*\n\nHe walked over, squatted down, and slapped the man's face a few times. Good, not dead, still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n...\n\nAfter giving his statement at the police station, the officer told Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall. The case Zhou Ze had reported was a bit strange—he claimed someone came to rob him, but the one who ended up knocked out was the \"assailant.\" And this assailant was currently in the hospital, so they had to wait for him to wake up to get further confirmation.\n\nStill, at least the officers hadn't put Zhou Ze in handcuffs.\n\nSquatting next to Zhou Ze was a middle-aged man whose left hand was cuffed to a radiator pipe.\n\n\"Bro, you're awesome. That guy was trying to rob you and you took him down instead?\" the scruffy-faced man said, rubbing his grimy bangs. \"That's the kind of style I had when I was young. For these blind petty thieves, you gotta beat 'em to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you, be quiet,\" a young police officer said as he walked over. \"How many times have you been in for stealing e-bike batteries this winter?\n\n\"I'm telling you, the New Year is almost here, can't you just behave? Or find a proper job and earn some money to send home? You're a grown man.\"\n\n\"Working a job? That's impossible. I'll never work a job in this life. I don't know how to do business. I can only get by like this, stealing e-bike batteries. Going to the detention center feels like coming home.\n\n\"Everyone in there is a talent, and they talk so nicely. I love it in there!\"²\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young officer didn't want to deal with this character anymore and turned to leave.\n\n\"Bro, what did you think of my speech just now?\" the greasy middle-aged man asked, winking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Pretty interesting,\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol. Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Let me tell you, this is how you gotta live...\" The greasy man trailed off, his gaze fixed on the entrance. \"Well, I'll be. She's gorgeous. Is she a cop?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head. At the entrance, a woman in a blue down jacket and knee-high leather boots was walking toward them with another female police officer.\n\n\"Probably a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, it was the aura she carried that was her biggest asset.\n\n\"But she's not in uniform,\" the greasy man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe she's plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right. A beautiful police belle, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in here more often.\" The greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, as if savoring the thought. \"If I could marry her, I'd give up ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He didn't dare make jokes about things like lifespan and mortal years anymore.\n\n\"You disagree?\" Seeing Zhou Ze shake his head, the greasy man said urgently, \"You have no taste! A woman like that, trading ten years of your life for her is definitely not a loss...\"\n\nJust then, the female officer and the woman in the long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to take you home. The investigation is clear, you're free to go,\" the female officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" The greasy middle-aged man.\n\n***\n¹ A vulgar Chinese curse implying an act so vile it invites karmic retribution on one's descendants.\n² This monologue is a direct quote from a famous Chinese viral video of a real-life thief, who became an internet meme for his anti-work philosophy and slight resemblance to Che Guevara.",

    "content": "Officer, excuse me, what was my wife's name again?\n\nThis thought only flickered through his mind; Zhou Ze wasn't *that* stupid. But he genuinely didn't know what his \"wife's\" real name was. In this day and age, very few people used their real names for their QQ or WeChat accounts.\n\nThe greasy man, however, shot Zhou Ze a resentful glance: *Bro, that's not cool. Weren't we supposed to be each other's broken-winged angels?*\n\nZhou Ze returned a helpless glance of his own: *I'm just as surprised as you are.*\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and muttered under his breath, \"The dumplings I make are delicious.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nHis \"wife\" spoke in a cool, detached tone, then turned and walked out on her own.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow.\n\nShe drove a Cayenne and got straight into the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the door and sat down in the front passenger seat.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nit was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unlucky devil, Xu Le, had a slightly more normal marriage and family life, Zhou Ze wouldn't be in such a cringeworthy situation right now. Faced with a concerned wife, he could have come up with some excuses, like feeling dizzy and unable to remember certain things.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the aura of an ice queen and seemed completely uninterested in talking to him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like she was just going through the motions.\n\n*My dog got lost, a security guard found it, and I'm going to pick it up.*\n\nThat was the feeling.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as him (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car got onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence.\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nAnd then,\n\nmore silence.\n\nThe woman felt her husband was being unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to investigate why.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She put it on speaker, and the voice from the other end came through the car's sound system:\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's been a school bus collision on Youth Middle Road. The injured are already being transported to our hospital. The Director wants you back here immediately.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly taken aback.\n\n*So my wife is a doctor, too.*\n\n*And...*\n\n*So my wife's surname is 'Lin'.*\n\n\"I know, I'm on my way back,\" the woman said, hanging up. She immediately took the next exit off the highway, made a U-turn at the traffic light, and headed toward the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first, or tell him to get out and take a cab. Instead, she drove all the way into the parking lot of the Chongchuan District People's Hospital.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze had been worried she might tell him to get out and find his own way home. He imagined having to sheepishly ask:\n\n\"Honey, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\nIt felt so stupid.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed suit. She entered the hospital building and got into an elevator; Zhou Ze followed her into the elevator. The woman went into the women's locker room; Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench in the hallway.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived: one seriously injured, plus five other children with significant injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and immediately get busy with treatment,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench in a daze.\n\nThe feeling was a bit like a mother taking her son to work; the mother works while the son watches from the side, playing by himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe hospital's characteristic smell of disinfectant and the stuffiness from the central air conditioning... it was all so nostalgic, so familiar.\n\nThe emergency room was just ahead. The critically injured patient seemed to be a little girl.\n\nThe accident had involved a kindergarten school bus. Watching the children cry out in pain on the operating tables was a truly heart-wrenching sight.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. In the past, at a time like this, he would have already changed his clothes and joined the treatment efforts. He was the most famous surgeon of the younger generation in Tongcheng. But now, he could only be a spectator.\n\nThe feeling was very uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. Besides, this People's Hospital was considered the best hospital in Tongcheng on paper; the quantity and quality of its doctors were beyond question. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. Their injuries were minor, only requiring wound cleaning or simple bandaging.\n\nA traffic police officer stood guard at the entrance to the floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, highly emotional, but letting them in at this time would likely disrupt the medical treatment. They could only be held back for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, and walked to the window at the far end of the corridor. He propped the window open, then pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le smoked too, which was convenient at the moment.\n\n\"Mister, you're not supposed to smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nJust as he put a cigarette to his lips, a clear, young girl's voice came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze turned around to see a little girl in a lily-print dress standing behind him, her cheeks puffed out as she looked at him indignantly.\n\n*Ahem.*\n\nHow embarrassing.\n\nZhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public decency was always a bit awkward.\n\n\"Aren't you cold dressed like that, little one?\" Zhou Ze asked, bending down.\n\nThe little girl's skin was delicate, her face had a touch of baby fat, and her eyes were large. She was very cute, like a life-sized Barbie doll.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" the little girl said, shaking her head. \"Mister, you can't smoke in the hospital again, okay?\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded very seriously.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine. The other kids are all hurt. They're in a lot of pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways, looking at the children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying; it wasn't so much that the pain was unbearable, but rather that when one person cried, the others would follow suit.\n\nThe nurses had to comfort the children while treating their wounds.\n\nOutside, the parents, temporarily held back by the police, were shouting and cursing nonstop.\n\nAll in all,\n\nthe entire floor felt chaotic.\n\n\"You're really lucky then,\" Zhou Ze remarked.\n\nThere wasn't a single scratch on the little girl.\n\n\"Uh-huh, I was sitting in the back row, so I'm okay,\" the little girl nodded. Then she took the initiative to go over and comfort her classmates, checking on one, peeking at another, encouraging and reassuring them.\n\nShe was a very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned back around, subconsciously taking out the cigarette again, only to think better of it and put it back.\n\nAs he walked back to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors walked out of the emergency room ahead.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor; the female doctor was his wife.\n\n\"It's okay. We did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to put a comforting hand on the shoulder of Zhou Ze's wife.\n\nAs the husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nbut he didn't find the scene offensive...\n\nThat damn Xu Le had left him in such a complicated mess—a live-in son-in-law with a hot-tempered sister-in-law and clearly ill-tempered in-laws.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't wait for his wife to have an affair, kick him out, and get a divorce so he could be left alone in peace.\n\nWho, having just been resurrected in a new body, would be bothered to deal with the ups and downs of life as a modern-day live-in son-in-law?\n\nHowever, what surprised Zhou Ze a little was that his wife actually raised her hand to block the doctor's wandering hand¹ and pointed directly at him, saying:\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\nHer words held not a trace of tenderness; they were simple, stark, as if she were saying, \"This is the husky my family owns.\"\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir.\" The male doctor looked a little awkward. No matter what, hitting on a woman right in front of her husband always made one feel a bit less confident.\n\nZhou Ze smiled as a greeting. *Looks like my dear wife is very faithful...* But he couldn't bring himself to feel happy about it. It wasn't about being cuckolded or anything,\n\nit was simply that a simpler life would be so much better.\n\n\"I'll go check on the others. The other children have all been treated and should be fine. You should go home and rest with your husband soon,\" the male doctor said before walking away.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves, tossing them on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and she was biting her lower lip. Clearly, she was in a very bad mood, which meant they hadn't been able to save the seriously injured child.\n\nThis appearance of hers was quite 'pitiable to behold.'\n\nZhou Ze began to understand Xu Le a little. This live-in son-in-law was doing much better than his peers. His in-laws being better off was a given, but on top of that, this Dr. Lin was truly, genuinely beautiful.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience this a lot more in the future. Just seek peace of mind.\"\n\nZhou Ze offered comfort from the perspective of a veteran. His experience far surpassed that of his \"wife,\" and his psychological resilience was naturally much stronger.\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe woman shot back those two words. If Zhou Ze had said this in his original capacity as a senior colleague, it would have been genuine guidance.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le, and for someone with his image to say such things to Dr. Lin was purely a case of it being easy for him to talk.²\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze shrugged, once again scorning that Xu Le in his mind. *Look how spineless you are. Your wife dares to tell you to shut up in public.*\n\nWith reddened eyes, Dr. Lin slowly stood up. \"I'm going to change. Let's go home.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt that moment, two nurses pulled back the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on it, covered by a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze glanced over. He had seen plenty of dead people. In all his years as a doctor, he had saved many lives, but there had also been many patients who died right in front of him, leaving him helpless.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, is that your husband?\" one of the young nurses asked in a teasing tone. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but unlike the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses, Dr. Lin's husband had never shown up at the hospital before.\n\nYou couldn't blame them for being able to joke in the face of death. It's like asking those artsy hipsters who post on social media about how their souls were purified and how moved they were by a single trip to Tibet to actually live there for ten years; they couldn't take it. It's just not realistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin nodded, her emotions having calmed down a bit by now.\n\n\"Then you two should hurry home. Maybe you have some 'activities' planned, right?\n\nI'm telling you, our Dr. Lin just loves kids. You two should hurry home and...\"\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\n\"...\" said the young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze had seen the hem of a lily-print dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind roared, and he suddenly realized that the little girl he had just seen, completely unharmed,\n\nwasn't human!\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Wandering hand:** The original text uses `鹹魚手` (xiányú shǒu), literally \"salty fish hand,\" which is slang for a groping or unwanted touch. \"Wandering hand\" is a common English equivalent.\n2.  **Easy for him to talk:** The original idiom is `站著說話不腰疼` (zhànzhe shuōhuà bù yāo téng), literally \"one's back doesn't hurt when talking while standing.\" It means it's easy to give advice or make comments when you're not the one experiencing the hardship.",

    "content": "That single \"Fuck,\"\n\nAfter he said it,\n\nThe two young nurses were at a loss, and Dr. Lin was also stunned for a moment.\n\nIt was just too simple and crude of a response.\n\nZhou Ze offered no explanation. He reached out directly and uncovered the white cloth over the girl's head.\n\nIt was her. It really was her!\n\nNo wonder she didn't have a single injury just now.\n\nNot even a scratch on her body.\n\nIt wasn't because she was lucky enough to be sitting in the back row.\n\nIn fact,\n\nShe was the most seriously injured of all the children; she was the one the doctors had been trying their best to save just moments ago.\n\nHer soul had already drifted out, yet she was unaware. She was still reminding him not to smoke in public, still going to comfort her classmates who had suffered minor injuries.\n\nActually,\n\nThose children couldn't see her at all.\n\nIn the entire hospital,\n\nThe only person who could see her,\n\nWas Zhou Ze!\n\n\"She's dead?\" Zhou Ze asked as his eyes scanned the surroundings.\n\n\"Xu Le?\" Dr. Lin looked at her husband. She didn't want to deal with his cursing just now, because she found her husband's mental state to be somewhat abnormal.\n\n\"She's not dead yet. Keep saving her, keep resuscitating!\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly grabbed Dr. Lin's arm, pulled her over, and roared:\n\n\"The time limit for resuscitation isn't up yet, there's still a chance she could wake up. Continue the resuscitation!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze grabbing Dr. Lin so violently, the two nurses immediately came forward to pull him away. In their eyes, Dr. Lin's husband was acting inexplicably, and he even showed tendencies of domestic abuse.\n\nZhou Ze pushed aside the two nurses beside him, also releasing his grip, and muttered under his breath:\n\n\"Where are you, where are you, where the hell are you!\"\n\nZhou Ze rushed out. He was running, searching.\n\nJust a moment ago, the girl's soul was still wandering among the children, comforting them. Now, she was nowhere to be found.\n\nHad she already gone to hell?\n\nShe was already dead.\n\nWas it too late?\n\nZhou Ze was a little dazed. He didn't know why he was so agitated, nor why he was so anxious.\n\nPerhaps it was because of his profession; it was his duty to treat any patient who had a chance of survival. And besides, he had just had an encounter with that kind and strong girl.\n\n\"Uncle, are you looking for me?\"\n\nA familiar child's voice sounded from behind Zhou Ze. He immediately turned around and saw the little girl again.\n\nOnly now, the little girl's body was not as solid as before. She had become semi-transparent.\n\n\"Uncle, I'm a little cold.\" The little girl squatted down, hugging her arms. \"I went to ask the big-sister nurses to lend me a piece of clothing, but they ignored me. Do they hate me? Am I very annoying?\"\n\nSpecks of light continuously dissipated from the little girl's body. Zhou Ze had seen this scene before; it had happened to him back then.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\n\nDr. Lin walked over at this moment.\n\nThe little girl turned her head to look behind her.\n\n\"Don't look!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward, reaching out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen if she saw her own body lying on the hospital bed.\n\nWould she break down?\n\nWould she realize she was dead and then dissipate completely?\n\nWhen Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, his fingernails grew slightly warm. They didn't grow longer or turn black, but Zhou Ze felt they were very hot. At the same time, the little girl's body began to twist, turning into a ring of light that wrapped around Zhou Ze's fingertips. This light was clearly invisible to everyone else around.\n\n\"Get out of the way, she can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze charged toward the hospital bed again.\n\n\"Xu Le!\" Dr. Lin's chest heaved. The dead was gone. She didn't know what nonsense her husband was still babbling on about. Besides, her husband studied civil engineering; he had no connection to medicine whatsoever.\n\nThis time, when Zhou Ze rushed over, the two young nurses didn't dare to stop him. Zhou Ze lifted the white cloth and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\n\nYes, this was how he had come back to life back then.\n\n*Your soul has come out,*\n\n*But it can go back in,*\n\n*You can live!*\n\nAfter seeing the light from his fingertips all enter the girl's body, Zhou Ze began to perform CPR, pressing on the girl's chest with his hands clasped together.\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\nThe two nurses didn't dare to approach and both looked at Dr. Lin.\n\n\"She's dead,\"\n\nDr. Lin said, walking to Zhou Ze's side.\n\n\"The golden window for resuscitation isn't over yet, I've been keeping track of the time,\" Zhou Ze roared while continuing the compressions. \"She can live, she can live!\"\n\nDr. Lin pursed her lips, then directly pushed Zhou Ze aside. She then began pressing on the girl's chest with her own hands clasped.\n\n\"Your force is too great. She has injuries on her body. Ah Chun, reconnect the monitor. Continue the resuscitation.\"\n\nZhou Ze was pushed away but didn't get angry, merely continuing to stare at the little girl on the bed.\n\nThe only fortunate thing was probably that the parents were being held back by the traffic police, and with so many children making noise outside, no one noticed what was happening here.\n\nDr. Lin continued the compressions, beads of sweat already forming on her forehead. She didn't know why she was joining this man in his madness, but for some reason, she had just seen something unusual in his eyes.\n\nAnd this man was her husband. Today, she felt she couldn't see through him at all.\n\nThe monitor was reconnected, but the screen still showed a flat line.\n\nThe two young nurses stood by, at a loss.\n\n*Can't be saved?*\n\n*Even after I put her soul back,*\n\n*She still can't be saved?*\n\nA feeling of wistful loss began to spread through Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n\"Beep...beep...beep...\"\n\nJust then,\n\nThe previously flat line suddenly showed a ripple.\n\nDr. Lin stared at the monitor in utter shock.\n\nThis...\n\nWas this a medical miracle?\n\n***\n\nIt was already night when they drove home from the hospital. Zhou Ze sat in the front passenger seat while Dr. Lin drove. The two were still not speaking.\n\nSilence seemed to be the standard configuration for this couple's relationship. However, in the past, it was always Xu Le who tried to break the silence. Today, it was Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Have you studied medicine?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Your technique just now was very professional,\" Dr. Lin could tell.\n\n\"I had some training when I was studying for my driver's license,\" Zhou Ze casually made up an excuse.\n\n\"But you don't have a driver's license.\" Dr. Lin frowned slightly.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*Right,* Zhou Ze silently scorned Xu Le once again in his mind.\n\nDr. Lin didn't plan to press the matter further. She just said, \"Today, thank you for your persistence.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least in his heart he still considered himself a doctor, saving a patient truly required no thanks.\n\nThe girl hadn't woken up yet and was still in a coma, but at least now there was hope.\n\n\"I thank you on behalf of that girl.\" Dr. Lin picked up her phone and glanced at it. \"It's almost eight. My parents are still waiting for us to come home for dinner.\"\n\nParents?\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a headache coming on.\n\n*Am I about to meet the mother and father-in-law?*\n\nThe car drove into a high-end residential complex. Tongcheng was close to Shanghai, geographically positioned with Shanghai on opposite ends of the Yangtze River estuary. Although it wasn't as extreme as Shanghai where every inch of land is gold, the housing prices here weren't cheap either.\n\nDr. Lin parked the car and walked inside. Zhou Ze followed behind her. The two entered an elevator, got out together, and Dr. Lin used a key to open a door.\n\nThe apartment was well-decorated, a duplex layout. Actually, one could tell from the car Dr. Lin drove that the Lin family's financial situation must be quite good.\n\nOf course, his current identity as a \"live-in son-in-law\" was also supporting evidence. After all, a family without some money and confidence couldn't recruit a man to marry into the family.\n\nOn the living room sofa, an elderly man with half-gray hair wearing a sweater was sitting and watching television. It was a rebroadcast of the evening news, and he watched with great interest.\n\nEven when his own daughter and son-in-law returned, he merely glanced at them and said nothing.\n\n\"Wanqiu, you're back.\"\n\nThe kitchen door was pushed open, and the mother-in-law poked her head out. Perhaps Dr. Lin and her younger sister inherited their height from their mother. The mother-in-law was very tall. She was slightly plump now, but she was still the type who could be the belle of the \"golden years\" square, making countless old men and grandpas vie for her attention.\n\n*Knock on the blackboard, take notes, highlight the key point.*\n\nZhou Ze finally knew his wife's full name—Lin Wanqiu.\n\nThe mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze, and her expression clearly darkened.\n\n\"Old man, time to eat. Wanqiu is back.\"\n\n\"Finally, we can eat,\" the sister-in-law said, walking out of the study. She shook her fist at Zhou Ze, then jutted her chin, signaling for him to pay attention to her parents.\n\nThis small gesture was rather nice. Although this girl was a bit headstrong, she wasn't too unreasonable.\n\nZhou Ze went to the bathroom to wash his hands. As he was washing, Lin Wanqiu also came in. The two of them used hand soap to scrub their hands, both very meticulously.\n\nLin Wanqiu glanced at Zhou Ze a couple more times, then rinsed her hands with water and walked into the living room.\n\nZhou Ze also rinsed his hands, dried them with a paper towel, and walked out of the bathroom.\n\nEveryone took their seats. Zhou Ze sat down in the chair next to Lin Wanqiu.\n\nWith a grim face, the mother-in-law brought the bowls of rice over one by one. When she placed one in front of Zhou Ze, she clearly used a bit more force.\n\n*Well, at least,*\n\n*She didn't purposely not give me any rice.*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n\"Xu Le, do you think we treat you poorly?\" the mother-in-law said before she even started eating.\n\n\"You treat me very well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then you not coming home last night, who were you giving that attitude to...\"\n\n\"Mom, let's eat. He had something to deal with at his shop, he told me,\" Lin Wanqiu spoke up.\n\nThe mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged a look, surprised that their elder daughter was actually speaking up for this son-in-law. It made them feel a bit uneasy, and for a moment, they forgot to continue their tirade.\n\nThe sister-in-law, watching from the side, was also a bit surprised. Her sister had never cared much about this so-called brother-in-law. Did the sun rise from the west today?\n\n\"Let's eat,\" the father-in-law said, picking up his chopsticks. \"You eat too.\" The father-in-law pointed his chopsticks specifically at Zhou Ze.\n\n*Hmm, that gesture is a bit rude, but at least it signals that last night's incident is over.*\n\n\"Wanqiu, have a piece of braised pork. Mom stewed it for a long time.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law placed a piece of meat in both her elder and younger daughters' bowls. Then, after a moment's hesitation, she placed a piece in her son-in-law's bowl as well.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze realize he hadn't eaten anything all day. From the moment he was resurrected in this body last night, through the morning and afternoon, he hadn't eaten.\n\nHe didn't stand on ceremony.\n\nHe picked up the meat and put it in his mouth.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze's expression froze.\n\nAn unexpected wave of nausea rose from his heart, and even his stomach began to spasm violently.\n\n\"Blargh...\" Zhou Ze dry-heaved directly, as if what he was eating was poison.\n\n\"...\" The mother-in-law.\n\n\"...\" The father-in-law.\n\nThe atmosphere at the dinner table,\n\nInstantly plunged to a freezing point.",

    "content": "\"Excuse me.\"\n\nZhou Ze held up a hand, trying to signal it wasn't intentional, because this was a huge slap in the face—especially since he had no idea why this live-in son-in-law, \"Xu Le,\" was so disliked by his parents-in-law to begin with.\n\n\"Are you not feeling well?\" Dr. Lin asked, putting down her chopsticks.\n\n\"I'm fine, I'm fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled some rice into his mouth.\n\nBut just as the rice entered his mouth, before he could swallow, his stomach spasmed again. A wave of intense nausea rose from deep within him, as if what he was about to swallow wasn't rice, but the son of rice—shit.¹\n\n\"Pfft—\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze sprayed the rice from his mouth everywhere, spattering it all over the faces of his father- and mother-in-law, who were sitting across from him.\n\nHis father-in-law's glasses and hair were speckled with grains of rice.\n\nHis mother-in-law's coiled hair was also dotted with glistening white specks.\n\nWith a \"clatter,\" the chopsticks in his father-in-law's hand fell. His face twitched a few times, as if he hadn't yet processed what emotion he should use to face the current situation.\n\nThe mother-in-law, however, took a deep breath, the flames of fury already blazing in her eyes!\n\nThis was… throwing kindness back in her face!\n\n\"Clack!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law pushed her chair back and stood up.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law was a retired head nurse, so she knew that even if a person was sick, it was impossible to spray rice that dramatically. Besides, looking at Xu Le, he didn't seem to be on death's door.\n\nHe was doing this on purpose.\n\nHe must be doing this on purpose!\n\nHe was rebelling!\n\nRebelling!\n\nClutching his chest, Zhou Ze left the dining table and rushed into the bathroom. He lifted the toilet lid and began to dry heave violently.\n\nThis time, he even threw up bile, and a bitter taste filled his mouth.\n\nThis meal was not going to happen.\n\nDr. Lin glanced at Xu Le, who was still retching in the bathroom, and said directly to her younger sister:\n\n\"Xiao Yi, go cook some noodles.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. She also felt that her brother-in-law had taken things a bit too far today. She immediately left the table and went to the kitchen to prepare some dried noodles.\n\n\"How outrageous! That bastard!\"\n\nThe father-in-law slammed his hand on the table and took off his glasses to shake them clean. Xu Le's father-in-law was a retired vice-president of the hospital who normally prized his refined appearance. Today, his bottom line had well and truly been crossed.\n\n\"I'm going to ask that guy just how our family has wronged him! We didn't ask for a single cent of bride price for the wedding, and we even paid to open that money-losing bookstore for him. How have we wronged him!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law prepared to march to the bathroom.\n\n\"Mom, just clean up here. He's not feeling well.\"\n\nDr. Lin began to clear the barely touched plates from the table.\n\n\"You're still defending him after all this?\" The mother-in-law's anger flared, and she pointed at her daughter, scolding her.\n\n\"What else should I do? Who was it that forced me to marry him by threatening to hang herself?\" Dr. Lin looked directly at her mother, her refined face appearing exceptionally resolute at that moment.\n\nThe mother-in-law was at a loss for words. Indeed, they were the ones who had forced their daughter to marry. They had been desperate to have a grandson, so they went to great lengths to recruit Xu Le as a live-in son-in-law. The thinking at the time was simple: she and her husband only had two daughters, so their only choice was to find a man to marry into the family so their grandson would carry their surname. And Xu Le, whose parents were both gone, was a college graduate who fit the requirements.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nThe father-in-law couldn't meet his daughter's gaze. He had been the one to make the final decision back then. Thinking about it now, he had indeed wronged his daughter. He stood up and went back to his study.\n\n\"Hey, old man, you have stomach problems,\" the mother-in-law called out anxiously.\n\n\"Mom, bring Dad a bowl of noodles later.\"\n\nDr. Lin finished clearing the table, then walked toward the bathroom.\n\nThe mother-in-law watched her daughter's back and, in the end, said nothing more.\n\nPushing open the frosted glass door of the bathroom, Dr. Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling by the toilet, one hand gripping its edge, the other clutching his chest.\n\n\"Not feeling well?\"\n\n\"I'm alright,\" Zhou Ze answered. He had been perfectly fine before dinner; who knew that he would become like this the moment he tried to eat.\n\n\"I asked Xiao Yi to make some noodles. You can eat later...\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nAt the mere thought of noodles, Zhou Ze felt an intense wave of nausea rise from deep within him again, and he started to dry heave once more.\n\nLin Wanqiu frowned slightly.\n\n\"Should we go to the hospital?\"\n\n\"No need. It's nothing. I'm not eating.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, struggling to his feet. He went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face.\n\nTonight's dinner was destined to end on a sour note.\n\nThe parents-in-law and the sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu's bedroom was on the second.\n\nAfter cleaning himself up, Zhou Ze took a quick shower. Not knowing where his change of clothes was, he didn't bother changing and went upstairs in his old clothes, his hair still dripping wet. Just as he reached the top of the stairs, he saw that Lin Wanqiu was showering in the second-floor bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the bathroom door for a moment, watching the graceful silhouette reflected in the glass, and lightly licked his lips.\n\nA man is always most impulsive at times like these. Of course, at times like these, he also knows best how to be grateful.\n\n*Thank you,* Zhou Ze said silently in his heart.\n\nThis was the first time in the two days since he had been resurrected in another's body that Zhou Ze had given a thumbs-up to that unlucky bastard Xu Le.\n\n*Although you left behind an incredibly messed-up set of relationships, your wife is truly beautiful.*\n\nWith a hint of fantasy, a bit of excitement, a touch of impatience, and a sliver of hope, Zhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door.\n\nAnd then, Zhou Ze's expression changed. He bit his lip.\n\nIn his mind, he dragged out the very same Xu Le he had just praised and proceeded to whip his corpse ten thousand times.\n\nThe bedroom was large.\n\nThere was a large bed.\n\nAnd next to the large bed, there was a pallet on the floor!\n\nEven an idiot would know what that meant!\n\nWas that guy sick in the head?\n\nWas that guy a moron?\n\nWhat was the point of being a live-in son-in-law like this?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths, then silently lay down on the pallet.\n\n*Just sleep.*\n\n*No more struggling.*\n\n*Stop thinking about it.*\n\n*I'll see if I can get some money, move out on my own, and then, whether it's divorce or something else, just resolve this complicated relationship. Having been resurrected in another's body, there are still many problems I have to face.*\n\nLin Wanqiu came out after her shower. She was wearing a blue, slightly fluffy nightgown that looked a little big on her.\n\nLying on the floor, Zhou Ze subconsciously swallowed.\n\n\"Get up,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You've always slept on the bed, and I've slept on the floor,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze silently got up and climbed onto the bed.\n\nLin Wanqiu turned off the light and lay down on the pallet on the floor.\n\nPerhaps this was her way of compensating for her unwillingness to share a bed with Xu Le. She would sleep on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze sighed and prepared to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, still awake. He turned over.\n\nAn hour later, still awake. He turned over again.\n\nEven after three hours, when it was already past midnight, he was still awake.\n\nHis eyelids were heavy, but he just couldn't fall asleep.\n\nMeanwhile, Lin Wanqiu, on the floor, was breathing steadily. She must have been asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it absolutely wasn't because there was a beautiful woman sleeping nearby that his blood was racing and he couldn't sleep.\n\nHe was tired, exhausted even, especially after everything that had happened today.\n\nBut damn it all, he just couldn't sleep.\n\nLying in bed, Zhou Ze simply opened his eyes and looked at his hands.\n\nToday, he had used these hands to save that little girl's life. Although the girl hadn't woken up yet, her vital signs had returned. There was still hope for her.\n\nWas this a special ability he had gained after his trip through hell?\n\nOr was it something that old man left behind when he grabbed his wrist before he died?\n\nBut still, the feeling was pretty good.\n\nAs a doctor, with a pair of hands like these, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that transcended medical technology and comprehension, something that could even allow him to surpass the level of Hua Tuo and Bian Que.² Every practitioner in every field hopes to one day surpass the founding masters. Perhaps it wasn't for money or fame, but a kind of... heartfelt aspiration.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze suddenly felt his arms convulse, and a sharp pain shot through them.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze sucked in a sharp breath, his whole body curling up on the bed.\n\nBut the pain continued, and it was escalating!\n\nCold sweat beaded on Zhou Ze's forehead from the pain. Unable to bear it, he got out of bed and left the bedroom.\n\nHe went into the bathroom but didn't turn on the light, just sat on the toilet. In the dimness, Zhou Ze could see dark blue veins bulging all the way down his arms to his fingernails, looking as if they were about to split open.\n\nThe pain originated from them, as if something was hammering at his very marrow.\n\n*Damn it.*\n\n*What the hell is going on!*\n\nZhou Ze's face began to twist in agony.\n\nThis feeling was excruciating, so much so that it gave him the urge to grab a kitchen knife and chop off his own arms.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to recall the image of himself lying in an ice-cold casket, about to be pushed into an incinerator.\n\nHe also seemed to recall fragments of his time in hell, trudging numbly toward the end.\n\nIs this a curse?\n\nIs this a punishment?\n\nWhat am I being punished for?\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I smuggled myself back?\n\nBecause I'm not a living person, so heaven is punishing me?\n\nOr... is it because I used it to save someone today?\n\n*That's it. That must be the reason.*\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he had used that ability to save someone, he had broken some kind of rule and was suffering a backlash.\n\n*Then,*\n\n*If I go and kill that girl now, will the pain stop?*\n\nA black mist began to gather in Zhou Ze's eyes, though he was completely unaware of it.\n\n*\"Mister, you're not supposed to smoke in the hospital.\"*\n\nThe little girl's voice echoed in Zhou Ze's mind again.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head violently.\n\n*No.*\n\n*I saved her, and that's that!*\n\n*I don't regret it.*\n\n*I don't regret it!*\n\n...\n\n\"Mom, are you not done yet?\"\n\n\"I just got in here. Go use the bathroom on the second floor.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law headed up to the second floor. She really couldn't hold it in any longer. The light in the second-floor bathroom was off, and she pushed the door open and walked right in.\n\nAnd then, just at that moment, Zhou Ze looked up at her.\n\nShe also looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nWithin Zhou Ze's eyes, a black mist swirled, carrying an immense, terrifying power. It was the gaze of a vengeful demon that had just crawled out of hell, cursed and crazed.\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law screamed in terror and fell to the floor.\n\nShe stared at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was also staring at her.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw that the bottom of his sister-in-law's pajama pants was—wet. A discordant puddle of liquid had appeared on the tile floor...\n\nHe had...\n\nScared her into peeing herself?\n\n***\n\n¹A pun in the original Chinese.

    "content": "A scream woke the whole family.\n\nAnd no wonder.\n\nOpening the door to a dark bathroom late at night, desperate to pee, only to suddenly find someone inside—that's scary enough. I'm sure most people have had a similar experience.\n\nWhat's more, what the sister-in-law had encountered was a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and helped her sister up.\n\n\"What's wrong? What's wrong!\"\n\nHer father- and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor. They saw their younger daughter crying in her sister's arms, and then glanced at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"So it was you, Xu Le! You filthy bastard, has your conscience been completely clouded? To think you'd even have designs on my younger daughter!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law grabbed the broom by the bathroom door, ready to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was the same, angrily preparing to come in and teach his wretched son-in-law a lesson.\n\nIt was no wonder.\n\nSeeing this scene, anyone would naturally jump to that conclusion.\n\nThe brother-in-law had gone mad and made a move on his sister-in-law.\n\nAfter all, as the old saying goes: half of a sister-in-law's ass belongs to her brother-in-law.¹\n\n\"Mom, Dad, Xiao Yi just got scared when she went into the bathroom,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law froze, her raised broom now hovering awkwardly.\n\nThe father-in-law also stopped in his tracks, then took a few sheepish steps back.\n\nThis interruption made Zhou Ze suddenly realize that the blue veins on his arms had receded at some point, and the intense pain had vanished along with them.\n\nRight now, he felt so tired, so sleepy. He just wanted to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, ready to leave the bathroom. As for his father- and mother-in-law, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to argue with them. He had no interest in cleaning up the mess left behind by that coward, Xu Le.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze stood up, his sister-in-law shivered violently and burrowed deeper into her sister's arms.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. What had she seen just now?\n\n\"What on earth is going on!\" The mother-in-law put her hands on her hips and questioned her younger daughter. This didn't seem like the reaction of someone who was just scared. \"Xiao Yi, my sweet girl, tell Mommy, what really happened? Did he... do something to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was quite honest, and she knew she couldn't lie about something like this, or the consequences would be very serious.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, and when I opened the door, I saw him sitting inside. It was terrifying!\"\n\nAfter mustering the courage to say this, the sister-in-law buried her head in her sister's arms again.\n\nAlright, so it was all a misunderstanding.\n\n\"You thoughtless thing, you know not to turn on the light when you use the bathroom at night?\n\nDo you think my house is like yours, all stingy and cheap?\n\nUnwilling to spare a little for the electricity bill!\n\nIf you scare my daughter into having some sort of problem, how are you going to compensate...\"\n\nThe mother-in-law began to berate Zhou Ze, her finger nearly poking him in the face.\n\nZhou Ze was exhausted right now. When a person is severely sleep-deprived, they tend to have a very short temper. Plus, Zhou Ze had long grown impatient with the god-awful web of relationships Xu Le had left him.\n\nIf they weren't sleeping in separate beds, Zhou Ze might not have blown up.\n\nBut now that they were, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to take any more crap from this snobbish mother-in-law.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nZhou Ze swatted her pointing finger away.\n\n\"Don't bother me.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened, clearly in disbelief that this consistently timid and meek son-in-law of hers would dare to speak to her like that.\n\n\"How dare you speak to your mother like that! Have you no manners at all!\" the father-in-law barked at this moment.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to be a divorcée, then by all means, keep lecturing me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze shot back directly, then shouldered his father-in-law aside and walked back to the bedroom.\n\n\"Bang!\" He slammed the door shut with great force.\n\n\"Outrageous! Simply outrageous!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law hurried to her husband's side to soothe his chest.\n\nBut in the end, neither of them dared to press the issue further.\n\nAfter all, what Zhou Ze had just said held a great deal of intimidating power for them.\n\nAlthough they didn't know what had gotten into their normally spineless son-in-law, who usually wouldn't say a peep even if you beat him with a stick, he was right. Once their eldest daughter was divorced, she would be on her second marriage. It would be bad for her reputation, and for their family's reputation.\n\nBesides, in their view, a woman on her second marriage was no longer valuable and wouldn't be able to find a good family.\n\nIn truth, a person's character and whether their mindset is feudalistic really have little to do with their education or family background. Ultimately, it all comes down to their own inherent quality.\n\nJust like Xu Le's father- and mother-in-law at this moment. No matter how angry they were, they didn't dare to provoke their wretched son-in-law any further, terrified he would actually jump up and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and tried to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door.\n\n\"Xiao Yi is scared. I'm going to sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice. Then she left.\n\n*As if you were actually sleeping with me anyway...*\n\n***\n\nThe next day at noon, the father- and mother-in-law were eating lunch.\n\n\"Did he go to the bookstore?\" the father-in-law asked the mother-in-law.\n\n\"He's not even up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Unacceptable,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"Exactly...\"\n\nJust then, the mother-in-law abruptly stopped talking, because she saw Zhou Ze walking down the stairs. Zhou Ze's eyes were bloodshot, and the bags under them were severe.\n\nThe atmosphere grew stagnant.\n\nPerhaps because of last night's incident, Zhou Ze's status as the live-in son-in-law had risen somewhat. At least, the father- and mother-in-law didn't say anything more to provoke him.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze's current appearance made him look like he might grab a knife and start hacking at someone at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept across the dining table.\n\nZhou Ze put a hand to his chest.\n\nThe smell of rice, the smell of meat...\n\nSo nauseating.\n\nHe felt like throwing up again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out the door, breathing in the cool, fresh air outside, and felt a little better.\n\nHis head was groggy. Zhou Ze began to wander the streets aimlessly. He needed to think about some things quietly, but his current state of being desperately sleepy yet unable to sleep made it difficult to truly find peace.\n\nIt was conflicting.\n\nIt was agonizing.\n\nIt was like walking out of an internet cafe after pulling two all-nighters, or like a middle school student who stayed up all night reading a novel under the covers and then had to get up for class the next morning.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. The surroundings were somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign up ahead.\n\nTongcheng First Affiliated Hospital.\n\nHe'd actually wandered to his old workplace. Heh, maybe it was because Tongcheng was just too small.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the hospital, not to revisit old haunts, but intending to get some sleeping pills to try.\n\nHe could handle not eating, at worst he'd just drink a lot of water to fill his stomach and make do for a while. But not sleeping was long-term torture.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar work environment. On the photo roster of the emergency department on the ground floor, Zhou Ze saw that his own photo had been turned grayscale.\n\nHe then subconsciously walked to his original office. His desk had a new owner. A middle-aged doctor with a pockmarked face was sitting in his seat. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk; the man's surname was Kang.\n\nHe let out a long breath, a hint of melancholy in the sigh.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps this feeling of \"things and people have changed\" temporarily suppressed the torment of his sleepiness. Zhou Ze began to wander around the hospital.\n\nHe was reliving the bits and pieces of his life here.\n\nHis work,\n\nhis life,\n\nand,\n\nhis past.\n\nOr rather, his past life.\n\n*I can't go back. I really can't go back,* Zhou Ze repeated in his mind.\n\nThen, without realizing it, he had gone down the stairs and arrived at the basement level.\n\nHe stood still. As a doctor who had worked here for many years, he knew the layout of this floor.\n\nSome equipment storage rooms, and then, the morgue.\n\nHe remembered having once lain in the hospital morgue, and that it was there that the mortuary cosmetologist had applied his makeup.\n\nHe started walking again, heading toward the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to go see the place where he had once lain. This was the explanation he gave himself for walking in that direction, but in reality, it was a special feeling, guiding him forward from some unseen corner of his mind.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the door to the morgue. It had an electronic keypad lock. As it happened, Zhou Ze remembered the code. Doctors from other departments probably wouldn't have much interaction with this place, but Zhou Ze used to be in the ER. People brought to the ER were generally patients with severe injuries or illnesses, so it was inevitable that some couldn't be saved and had to be sent here for placement.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also functioned as a morgue for the police department. Some bodies of unknown origin or those still needing to be \"processed\" would be temporarily placed here. This was common practice in many places; if the local police department lacked facilities or forensic staff, bodies were often kept at the local funeral home or hospital.\n\nHe entered the code.\n\nThe lock opened directly.\n\nZhou Ze walked in.\n\nA chill washed over him.\n\nNot the kind of chill that prickles the skin,\n\nbut a special kind of gloom that seemed to suffocate the warmth in your heart.\n\nIn the morgue, naturally, lay corpses. This was a temporary resting place for the dead.\n\nNormally, there should have been an attendant stationed outside, but for some reason, Zhou Ze hadn't seen anyone when he walked in. Perhaps the person had slacked off and gone somewhere.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. A few bodies were placed on cold gurneys, covered with white sheets. Another body was wrapped in a floral quilt from home. Judging by the silver hair peeking out, the deceased was likely an elderly woman.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze had never been particularly afraid of corpses. What's more, he himself was now a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the freezer units, the kind with pull-out drawers.\n\nThe occupied drawers all had labels on the outside, recording the deceased's name, gender, and other information.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty freezer drawer. He reached inside, closed his eyes, and slowly took in the sensation. A feeling of intoxication gradually washed over him, as if only here could he find peace.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Zhou Ze lay down inside it.\n\n\"Screeeak...\"\n\nThe freezer drawer was slowly pushed in, until it finally closed.\n\nQuiet.\n\nCold.\n\nSilent.\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids.\n\nDrowsiness washed over him.\n\nHe had finally found the feeling of sleep.\n\nBut he couldn't sleep just yet.\n\nBecause he didn't know...\n\nwho had just been standing outside and pushed the freezer drawer closed for him...\n\n***\n\n¹A crude and chauvinistic Chinese folk saying implying a sense of entitlement a man has over his wife's younger sister.

    "content": "Zhou Ze began to kick outwards with his feet, trying to push his way out, but from outside came a series of clicks. This meant the lock on the ice coffin had been fastened.\n\nHe was locked in. There was no way out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt as if he were back in that cramped coffin he'd first been put into.\n\nExcept this time, Zhou Ze wasn't frantic or enraged. He simply reached up and knocked on the metal panel by his head.\n\n\"Need something?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't think a person had come here to push the ice coffin in and then lock it, unless that person was a deranged lunatic, and Zhou Ze didn't believe his luck was *that* bad.\n\nBesides,\n\nhe had closed the door after entering the morgue. A lunatic who knew the passcode to the morgue door?\n\nWould you believe that?\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze could only assume that one of *those things* had \"helped\" him out—and had done a very thorough job of it.\n\nBut after his question, the outside remained silent.\n\nZhou Ze decided to just ignore it. He closed his eyes again, ready to get some proper sleep.\n\nHe fell asleep quickly.\n\nAfter all, he hadn't slept in two days, and with so much happening, the accumulated exhaustion was terrifying.\n\n*Even if floods deluge the world after my death, right now, no one can stop me from sleeping.*\n\n...\n\nHe had no idea how long he'd slept, but when Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he felt refreshed and clear-headed. That long-lost vigor had returned. Unfortunately, his body was also frozen stiff.\n\nThe stiffness of his body was somewhat frightening. Zhou Ze wriggled around as best he could in the narrow space. A series of crisp cracks echoed, so satisfying that he let out an involuntary sound.\n\nAt the same time, the nails on his ten fingers naturally grew long and turned black, glinting with an unusual luster. The stiffness in his body, along with the cold energy that would be unbearable for a normal person, slowly gathered toward his fingertips.\n\nThe entire process didn't last long, but it left Zhou Ze no longer feeling cold or uncomfortable.\n\nHe subconsciously kicked out again, and the ice coffin slid open on its own.\n\nThe lock…\n\nwas undone?\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. He sat up on the steel slab, climbed out, and then pushed it back in.\n\nHis clothes were stiff, hanging on him like cardboard and feeling extremely uncomfortable. Zhou Ze's gaze swept across the room.\n\nThe Affiliated Hospital's morgue wasn't particularly large. Compared to those in big-city hospitals, it seemed almost bashful, but it still held a good number of corpses.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know who had pushed him in earlier, and finding them now would certainly be difficult.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had undone the lock while he was asleep, Zhou Ze had no intention of making things more complicated here.\n\nHe headed for the morgue door, intending to leave. But as he passed the gurneys covered with white sheets, Zhou Ze stopped.\n\nThe bodies under the white sheets showed nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe old woman wrapped in a floral family quilt also seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped.\n\nHe remembered that the old woman's position had been reversed—her head was now where her feet had been.\n\nThe morgue attendant wouldn't have come in while he was asleep just to flip the old woman around and do nothing else.\n\nZhou Ze stopped beside the old woman. \"If it was you,\" he said, \"come out now, or I'm leaving.\"\n\nThe old woman pushing him in and locking the drawer might have been malicious, but since she'd quietly unlocked it again, it meant she hadn't intended to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone had been about to come by, and seeing an unlocked drawer, they might have discovered him.\n\nAfter all, whether these drawers were locked or not was very obvious from the outside.\n\nAfter half a minute with no response, Zhou Ze decided not to wait any longer.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze hated this kind of thing.\n\nSo coy.\n\nPlaying hard to get.\n\nShe was clearly an old woman when she died, yet she insisted on putting on the airs of a young maiden.\n\nAlright, ageism was wrong, but a normal person's tolerance for a beautiful female ghost was always going to be a little higher. That was just human nature.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian¹ had a face full of wrinkles and big yellow teeth, do you think Ning Caichen would still have had a human-ghost romance with her?\n\nZhou Ze turned to look behind him.\n\nA silver-haired old woman was crouched there, dabbing at her eyes with a faded, well-washed handkerchief.\n\nBut ghosts have no tears, so from Zhou Ze's perspective, the old woman looked more like she was dry-wailing.\n\n\"Carry on crying. I won't disturb you.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned to leave.\n\nHe realized he was, after all, just a mere mortal; even when it came to ghosts, he was something of a \"looks-ist.\"\n\n\"Help me,\" the old woman said abruptly. \"I have money.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" Zhou Ze grunted. He needed money.\n\nThat damn Xu Le's Alipay and WeChat combined had less than two hundred yuan. Add to that the eleven hundred the \"murderer\" had sent back, and Zhou Ze's total assets were less than thirteen hundred.\n\nAnd his house and savings from his previous life had presumably all been donated to an orphanage. He was essentially destitute.\n\n\"My money is in a hidden compartment in my cabinet—an old, yellow-lacquered cupboard. There's thirty thousand yuan, and inside there's also my dowry: a jade hairpin and a jade bracelet. I don't know how much they're worth.\n\n\"I died suddenly. I didn't have time to tell my sons. I'm afraid they won't know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"I'll take a cut.\"\n\nThe old woman's face showed a flicker of reluctance, but she still nodded. \"That's only right.\"\n\nThe old woman knew that without an \"anomaly\" like Zhou Ze to pass on the message, her sons would probably never find the assets she left behind.\n\n...\n\nLeaving the hospital, Zhou Ze took a taxi directly to a place in Tongzhou District called Xingdong Town. It wasn't very far; the city of Tongcheng's airport was located in this town.\n\nEarlier at the hospital, Zhou Ze had asked at the registration desk. The old woman had been brought to the hospital, but resuscitation efforts failed and she died. Her family had then simply left her body at the hospital, abandoning it, and still owed an unpaid medical bill.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived at the town and, following the old woman's description, found the village.\n\nIt was a self-built, two-story house. Attached to the house was a small brick structure, like a rural outhouse.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived, he found several workers there demolishing a building—the brick one, of course.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, handed a cigarette to one of the workers, and asked, \"Still busy, with the New Year just around the corner?\"\n\n\"Got to make a bit of extra money before the New Year, you know? Anyway, we're all from the same village.\" The mason was quite nonchalant.\n\n\"This building, what's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked as he peered inside. Two workers were already tearing off the roof. The bricks from the small building's walls were being dismantled to be used again later. As for the inside, forget the yellow-lacquered cabinet the old woman mentioned; there wasn't even a small stool to be seen. It was completely empty.\n\n\"Their old ma died. She used to live in this little house alone. Now they're planning to tear it down and build a new kitchen.\" The worker leaned in to let Zhou Ze light his cigarette, then gave a somewhat reserved smile. \"See that man who just walked by in front? That's the eldest son.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man, whose hair was also turning white, had some bruises on his face.\n\n\"Five brothers. They got into a fight over the little bit of money their old ma left behind. These bricks, once they're taken down, the other four will come to claim their share.\n\n\"Just look at how times have changed. Their old ma's body is still at the hospital; they haven't even claimed it. None of the brothers is willing to pay off the medical debt.\"\n\n\"What about the things in the old woman's room?\" Zhou Ze's focus was on this. From the old woman's description, the thirty thousand yuan in the cabinet was her life savings, but the jade bracelet and hairpin were the truly valuable items, which could probably be sold for a couple hundred thousand without much trouble.\n\n\"Sold 'em to the scrap collector. Cleared it out a long time ago. Sold it all off right when the old lady was first hospitalized.\" The worker took another deep drag from his cigarette. \"Well, I'd better get back to it.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. This whole trip had been for nothing.\n\nThe things the old woman had left behind... not only did he not get a cut, but even her sons hadn't been fortunate enough to enjoy them. They had just ended up as a cheap score for some second-hand furniture dealer.\n\nZhou Ze was now quite frustrated. Being broke really was a huge pain. He was unwilling to use his abilities to swindle money—although it seemed easy and gratifying, saving that girl last time had nearly killed him with pain last night. Who knew what would happen if he kept messing around?\n\nWhether there were deities three feet above his head², Zhou Ze didn't know.\n\nBut if you kept digging three feet down, there was definitely a hell—because he'd been there.\n\nHe knew he wasn't human, and this was the mortal realm. Besides, he still vividly remembered how that patient who died in front of him had screamed \"I've been found out!\" in terror right before his death.\n\nBut...\n\nMoney...\n\nZhou Ze was willing to push the millstone³,\n\nbut who would pay him?\n\nZhou Ze needed money now. Setting aside the matter of escaping his status as a \"live-in son-in-law,\" he at least needed to buy himself a freezer or a large refrigerator, right?\n\nOtherwise, would he have to run to the hospital morgue every day just to freeload off their refrigeration?\n\nFeeling rather dejected, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, feeling utterly frustrated.\n\nJust then, the phone in his pocket rang. Zhou Ze picked it up. It was an unknown number. He answered the call.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Boss, the goods arrived safely. When are you coming to inspect them? The cops have been cracking down hard lately; it wasn't easy getting this shipment in,\" the person on the other end of the line said in a low, careful voice.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nwithout making a sound.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nhis opinion of Xu Le suddenly skyrocketed.\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Nie Xiaoqian** and **Ning Caichen**: The main characters of *A Chinese Ghost Story*, a famous tale from classical Chinese literature about a romance between a beautiful female ghost and a mortal scholar.\n2.  **Deities three feet above his head**: From the Chinese proverb `舉頭三尺有神明` (jǔ tóu sān chǐ yǒu shénmíng), meaning the heavens are always watching and one's deeds do not go unnoticed.\n3.  **Push the millstone**: A reference to the proverb `有錢能使鬼推磨` (yǒu qián néng shǐ guǐ tuī mò), which literally means \"With money, you can even make a ghost push a millstone.\" It's the equivalent of \"Money makes the world go round.\" Here, Zhou Ze (who is like a ghost) is willing to do the work, but needs the money first.",

    "content": "Nervousness, unease, along with a hint of secret delight and confusion—this was probably how Zhou Ze felt the entire cab ride to the outskirts of Tongcheng.\n\nHe needed money, desperately, but he didn't need a huge fortune. There was no use for a large sum of money, at least not for the time being.\n\nBecause he had died and been reborn, he needed a sum of money to resolve the entanglements of his past life and the troubles of this one. After that, he would need to plan for the long term, not live a life of extravagance and indulgence.\n\nFor example, leaving the Lin family. Although Lin Wanqiu was beautiful and elegant, he really couldn't be bothered to go back to that home anymore. They had never been intimate, and he had never truly enjoyed any of the benefits. It seemed that fellow Xu Le hadn't really enjoyed them either, so naturally, there was no sense of debt.\n\nTherefore, saying \"bye-bye\" came with no psychological burden.\n\nBut leaving that home required some preparation. He needed a place of his own and a freezer of slightly better quality. Zhou Ze didn't dare to rummage through a second-hand market for a discarded freezer. What if something went wrong while he was sleeping inside and he ended up getting himself killed? Wouldn't that be a terrible loss?\n\nMoney!\n\nEven being a ghost costs money.\n\nBut judging from the phone call that man had made to Xu Le, Zhou Ze felt a new wave of anxiety. Xu Le, a live-in son-in-law in a modern city, so pathetic that he let his in-laws walk all over him at home, so pathetic that he slept in a separate bed from his wife—turned out to be a hidden gang boss?\n\nAlright, the contrast in this image was genuinely thrilling, and very much in the style of an American TV show. The most capable people always have a real-world identity that seems incredibly ordinary.\n\nLike how Spider-Man is a high school student, and Superman is a reporter for a newspaper.\n\nSo, how should he handle this situation?\n\nGet rid of that bunch?\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to \"taint\" this identity of his, because that would mean endless trouble. The police's investigation into him in the real world was already more than Xu Le could easily handle, not to mention the people that the old man and the faceless woman had shouted about, the ones who \"will find you and will catch you.\"\n\nIt was a bit of a headache, and he was still getting used to it, but Zhou Ze nevertheless arrived at that abandoned little fertilizer plant.\n\nTwo men were squatting at the entrance of the fertilizer plant. One wore a somewhat shabby military greatcoat, the other a cheap, poor-quality suit.\n\nBoth men were squatting there with cigarettes dangling from their lips, puffing away.\n\nZhou Ze paid the fare, got out of the car, and the two men immediately stood up and proactively walked over.\n\n\"Our boss is waiting for you,\" the man in the military greatcoat said in a deep voice.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, then followed the man in the greatcoat inside. The man in the suit resumed his squat, continuing to smoke as if keeping watch.\n\nAfter walking in, Zhou Ze saw a bald, fat man wearing a gold chain, sitting on a plastic chair and drinking by himself. Upon seeing Zhou Ze arrive, the fat man immediately stood up.\n\n\"Brother Xu, you're finally here.\"\n\nThe fat man was huge, about one meter eighty-five, and his gold chain was thick and gaudy. Even more gaudy was the gold dust that had rubbed off from the chain onto his neck.\n\n\"Where's the merchandise?\"\n\nZhou Ze clasped his hands behind his back, his fingers lightly intertwined. There were only three people here. Taking them all down wouldn't be a big problem, but what would he do after that? Turn them over to the police? Wouldn't that get him implicated as well?\n\nDeal with them himself? Punish them in the name of the moon?¹ That didn't seem right either. Given his sensitive identity, if he killed people indiscriminately, it might trigger the same kind of backlash as saving people indiscriminately. He was unwilling to test that theory lightly.\n\n\"Brother Xu is as straightforward as ever!\"\n\nThe fat man wiped his mouth, then reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched. He took a deep breath, forcing himself not to slap the fat man's greasy hand away.\n\n\"Come, this way!\"\n\nThe fat man made an inviting gesture, leading Zhou Ze to a small warehouse in the backyard.\n\nUpon walking in,\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nThe merchandise was piled up like a small mountain, covered with black oil-paper bags.\n\nZhou Ze had never done anything illegal before, but he knew that with this much merchandise, according to the law, it would be enough to have him shot hundreds of times over. He could eat enough \"peanuts\"² to make his stomach burst.\n\n\"It's not just for Tongcheng, is it?\" What Zhou Ze really wanted to ask was, *did you guys just rob a warlord in the Golden Triangle?*\n\n\"Of course not, Brother Xu. Tongcheng is still too small. This shipment will ultimately use Tongcheng as a springboard to flow into Shanghai.\" The fat man stretched. \"This time, let's hurry up and get rid of the goods. We'll make a huge pile of cash.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and touched his forehead, saying with difficulty, \"It'll be hard to get rid of it all in a short time, won't it?\"\n\nAfter all, this wasn't like selling cabbages, where you could just ride a tricycle around shouting through a megaphone.\n\n\"Don't you worry about that, Brother Xu. We just need to distribute this batch to the people below us. Although the profit isn't as high as selling it ourselves, the advantage is speed and guaranteed sales. Once this batch is done, we'll go get another one,\" the fat man said dismissively.\n\n*Xu Le, oh, Xu Le, you even built up a drug trafficking network. You really are something else...*\n\nAnd a big shot like this was actually bludgeoned to death by that idiot over a measly three hundred yuan!\n\n\"Brother Xu, come take a look. How's the quality of this batch?\"\n\nAs he spoke, the fat man lifted the oil-paper bags on top.\n\nThen, a look of astonishment appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\n\nBecause what he saw wasn't a mountain of drugs, but stacks of books and discs.\n\n*Could it be hidden in the pages of the books?*\n\n\"Brother Xu, thanks to your classmate, getting this batch was a piece of cake. These discs are all popular movies still showing in theaters. I even made sure to burn a few *****³ into them. These pirated books and romance novels are also bestsellers on the market.\n\nAnd Brother Xu, the twenty-part, two-million-word expanded sequel to *Bai Jie*⁴ that you specifically wrote—a lot of our downstream contacts have already pre-ordered this one. We won't have any trouble selling it.\"\n\n\"The merchandise you were talking about... is this?\" Zhou Ze asked the fat man.\n\n\"Yeah?\" The fat man paused for a moment. \"This is it.\"\n\nDisappointment.\n\nGreat disappointment.\n\nExtreme disappointment.\n\nAnd at the same time, he felt so ashamed.\n\nXu Le was still Xu Le, after all. To ensure these pirated goods sold well, he had actually written a sequel to the story of Bai Jie himself.\n\nAnd he had written a two-million-word sequel.\n\nJust how bored was he...\n\n\"How much can I cash out?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I'm planning to pull out.\"\n\nSince they were partners in business, there must have been an initial investment.\n\n\"What? Brother Xu, you're planning to pull out?\" The fat man said with some surprise. \"We're just about to rake in the money, and you're pulling out now?\"\n\n\"Yes. This business doesn't quite align with core values. I don't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze said this very seriously. He didn't want to take even the slightest risk, especially before he had sorted out his current life. He didn't want to get drawn into any potential whirlpools.\n\n\"...\" The fat man.\n\n\"...\" The man in the military greatcoat.\n\n\"Brother Xu has high morals. I admire that. For the initial investment, Brother Xu, you put in...\"\n\nThe fat man held up four fingers and said, \"Twenty thousand yuan.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand it is, then. Give me the money. What happens next has nothing to do with me.\" Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to argue about it. Getting twenty thousand yuan would solve his immediate, pressing needs.\n\n\"Alright, I've got twenty thousand here.\" The fat man nodded and went to get the money.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze, with twenty thousand yuan in his pocket, hailed a ride-sharing car and started heading back to the city.\n\nHe didn't go back to the bookstore right away. Instead, he went to an electronics market and spent over ten thousand on a freezer. This type of freezer was generally used by businesses to store food and meat products, and it was one of the higher-end models. Zhou Ze didn't hesitate to spend the money. After all, he would be relying on it to sleep from now on. He was afraid a cheap one would have problems.\n\nThe merchant was very enthusiastic and sent a small truck to deliver the freezer for Zhou Ze directly to... the bookstore entrance.\n\nAfter the driver and Zhou Ze moved the freezer into the bookstore, the driver looked a bit stunned.\n\n\"Boss, you run a bookstore. What do you need a freezer for?\" the driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed him a cigarette. \"Business is tough. I'm planning to sell seafood on the side.\"\n\nThe driver took the cigarette and left. Anyway, the goods were delivered; he didn't need to worry about anything else.\n\nThe bookstore had a small second floor, which Xu Le had originally used to store extra books. After Zhou Ze cleared it out, he placed the freezer up there. Looking at his \"new bed,\" Zhou Ze finally felt a great sense of relief.\n\nComing down from the second floor, Zhou Ze found someone in his bookstore. Not a customer, but his \"wife.\"\n\nDoctor Lin was flipping through a magazine. Seeing Zhou Ze come down, she asked with some confusion, \"What were you busy with up there?\"\n\n\"Organizing inventory,\" Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n\"I'm off work,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Mm.\" *Off work, but you're not going to sleep with me...*\n\n\"That girl woke up.\" Doctor Lin looked pointedly at Zhou Ze. \"Her father wants to treat our department to dinner at the Tongcheng Grand Hotel. You should come too.\"\n\n\"What would I do there?\"\n\n\"The girl kept calling for 'Uncle' after she woke up.\" Doctor Lin asked Zhou Ze with some curiosity, \"Did you know her before?\"\n\n\"People can still be aware of things even when they're in a coma, right?\" Zhou Ze continued to spin his tale. \"She probably sensed it when I was saving her.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not hungry. I have no appetite at all.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded and didn't insist. She seemed about to leave, but she stopped at the bookstore entrance. She paused for a moment, then asked, \"Are you coming home tonight?\"\n\nBack to the same old question.\n\n*I go home, and you still won't sleep with me...*\n\nSo, Zhou Ze answered very decisively:\n\n\"Not going back. I've been a bit busy lately.\"\n\nYes, even though business at the store was as dead as an iced latte.\n\nDoctor Lin hesitated for a moment, but didn't press him. She took her car keys out of her pocket, preparing to leave.\n\nJust then,\n\n*Clang!*\n\nDoctor Lin turned around to see her \"husband\" collapsed against a bookshelf, sending books tumbling to the floor.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Doctor Lin immediately rushed over to check on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt his vision start to blur, making it difficult to focus. His chest heaved, and his legs felt weak, as if he had just stepped on cotton and completely lost his balance.\n\n\"Fainted from hunger...\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe...\n\n...hadn't eaten in days.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A reference to the catchphrase of the anime character Sailor Moon.\n² \"Peanuts\" is slang for bullets.\n³ Censored in the original text, likely referring to pornographic films.\n⁴ *Bai Jie* is the title of a famous and lengthy piece of Chinese internet erotica.\n\n---\n**Author's Note:**\n\nFive days since the book's release, and we're second on the overall new book charts for the same period!\n\nIn the supernatural category, aside from the monthly ticket chart, which we can't rank on until the book becomes a premium title, we're number one on all the other charts!\n\nYesterday, we were second in daily sales on Qidian!

    "content": "Next to the bookstore was a noodle shop. Its business was actually just so-so, almost as deserted as Zhou Ze's own bookstore.\n\nThis was because the pedestrian street had originally been established around the periphery of a plaza, but that plaza was now defunct. Aside from a movie theater, all the other businesses inside had already moved out or closed down. As a result, the entire plaza had become a desolate, rarely-visited area.\n\nAt least here in Tongcheng, the symptoms of overzealous urban development were already showing. In previous years, commercial centers had been planned and built on a massive scale, but Tongcheng wasn't Shanghai, after all; it couldn't provide that much foot traffic.\n\nFortunately, however, this noodle shop could still do delivery business, and it seemed to be doing quite well. But obviously, no one was going to suddenly feel spiritually \"hungry\" and order a few books via delivery to go home and chew on.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back in his chair, still a little dizzy. Dr. Lin sat opposite him, wiping his chopsticks with one of her tissues before placing them in front of him.\n\nShe was meticulous and considerate, just as she had been when she let Xu Le sleep on the bed while she took the makeshift bed on the floor. But at the same time, she was also very cold.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother asking whether she was truly against feudal arranged marriages or if she was just a lesbian, because there was no point in asking. Zhou Ze himself had no interest in the inexplicable web of relationships Xu Le had left behind, nor did he feel any attachment to it.\n\n\"Your body, is it really okay?\" Dr. Lin asked again.\n\n\"Minor problem, minor problem.\" Zhou Ze was a doctor himself. He knew that his issues with eating and sleeping were difficult to explain with the theories of modern medicine, let alone treat.\n\nFortunately, his sleeping problem was now taken care of, but this eating thing... what a headache.\n\nIf he didn't eat, he'd pass out, just like he had a moment ago. But eating... the very thought made him feel nauseous.\n\n\"If you have a poor appetite, have a bowl of sour plum juice first,\" the noodle shop owner said. He was about thirty, but his face already had some wrinkles; the burden of life was clearly not a light one.\n\n\"Sour plum juice, will that help?\" Zhou Ze asked, feeling helpless.\n\n\"It'll whet your appetite.\" The noodle shop owner smiled, then shouted toward the back room, \"Honey, are the pickled vegetable noodles ready yet?\"\n\nThe owner walked into the back room, and the sounds of the husband and wife talking could be heard.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the sour plum juice in front of him. He picked up a spoon, scooped up a mouthful, and brought it to his lips. The moment he swallowed, his expression changed.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin pulled out a facial tissue and held it to his chin.\n\nZhou Ze's face contorted as he clutched his stomach.\n\nThen he took a deep breath and said:\n\n\"That's really sour.\"\n\nYes, so sour his entire body felt like it was about to go into spasms. It even overwhelmed the feeling of nausea.\n\n\"Coming, the noodles are here.\" The owner's wife walked over carrying the noodles and set them down in front of Zhou Ze. At the same time, she said, \"You can't drink our sour plum juice that fast.\"\n\nDr. Lin glanced at the noodles and frowned slightly. \"These noodles... they're cooked way too mushy.\"\n\nMeaning, they had been cooked for too long and had lost their springiness, which would greatly affect the texture.\n\n\"Well... our noodles are just like this,\" the owner's wife said, looking embarrassed.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand. Mushy or not, springy or not, it was meaningless to him right now. As long as he could get it down, that was all that mattered. He needed energy. If he couldn't eat, Zhou Ze's only other option was to go to the hospital for a glucose IV drip.\n\nWith great solemnity, he raised his head, feeling as grim and dignified as a suicide warrior. Then he abruptly lowered his head and poured the entire bowl of unimaginably sour plum juice into his mouth in one go.\n\n*Hiss...*\n\nThat shocking sourness...\n\nIt was like pouring sulfuric acid into his stomach.\n\nBut immediately after, Zhou Ze grabbed his chopsticks, picked up the noodles, and began shoveling them into his mouth. He wolfed them down as fast as he possibly could. In five or six mouthfuls, the entire bowl of noodles was in his stomach. He then picked up the bowl and drank all of the noodle soup.\n\n*Haaaah...*\n\n*Clack!*\n\nZhou Ze set the empty noodle bowl down.\n\nHe let out a long sigh of relief. He got it down!\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze reached up and clutched his chest. The nausea, which had been suppressed by the plum juice, came rushing back. But the food was already in his stomach. Zhou Ze practically had to choke himself with both hands to keep from throwing it up.\n\nNot throwing it up was a success.\n\nThe food,\n\nwas finally down.\n\nBeads of sweat had already broken out on Zhou Ze's forehead. He grabbed a napkin from the table and wiped his face.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nboth Dr. Lin and the owner's wife were staring, stunned. Zhou Ze's way of eating just now had been simply too horrifying.\n\n\"Heh heh, looks like you were really hungry. Want another bowl?\" the owner's wife asked.\n\n\"No, no, that's alright,\" Zhou Ze refused.\n\n\"Okay then.\" The owner's wife cleared the bowl and chopsticks from in front of Zhou Ze and shouted to the back room, \"Hey, dad, get the dough ready for the afternoon. We should be getting delivery orders soon.\"\n\nThe owner's wife walked inside. Her figure from behind couldn't be called graceful, and her looks could only be considered plain, but the curious combination of her heavy chest and perky lower body added a special kind of charm, making her exceptionally attractive.\n\n\"You like... that type?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nIt was because Zhou Ze had been watching the owner's wife until she disappeared into the back room.\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. *I actually like your type, but you won't let me sleep with you.*\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled by his own thought. The idea of \"won't let me sleep with her\" had been in his mind for a long time, almost becoming an obsession. He had to admit, Dr. Lin was truly beautiful, and she was young.\n\nEven though she was Xu Le's wife,\n\nand even though Zhou Ze had never married in his past life,\n\nif he were being honest with himself,\n\nhe still wanted to sleep with her.\n\nIt was precisely because he couldn't that he was so fixated, that she was so often on his mind.\n\n\"Not going home?\" Dr. Lin asked again.\n\n\"Not going back,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"Then I'll be leaving.\" Dr. Lin stood up. \"Call me if you need anything.\"\n\nAfter all, he was her husband in name, even if they had no real marital relations.\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze nodded. *If I'd known you were this easy to talk to and this considerate, I really should have borrowed some money from you when I was broke.*\n\nDr. Lin left, driving away in her Porsche Cayenne.\n\nZhou Ze, however, remained seated in the noodle shop. His bookstore was right next door. Even though he had finished his noodles, it was fine to sit and chat for a while. They were neighbors, after all.\n\nThe owner came out from the back room and handed Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n\"How much?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Don't be a stranger. Big bro can still afford to treat you to a bowl of noodles.\" The owner waved his hand magnanimously. They were neighbors who saw each other all the time; no need to create distance over a bowl of noodles.\n\n\"Won't your wife scold you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No way. She's just a woman, what does she know? It's not her place to say anything.\" The noodle shop owner's male chauvinism was palpable.\n\nNo matter a man's status at home, he at least had to put on a front outside. No one was willing to admit they were afraid of their wife, just as no one was willing to admit they couldn't perform in bed.\n\n\"Heh heh, your wife's very pretty,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nTeasing a man about his wife was a taboo. If two men were facing outward, teasing some woman walking down the street, that would be a fun topic of conversation between men.\n\nThe owner paused for a second, said nothing, and just smiled. The owner had a good temper. People who run small businesses generally understand that harmony brings wealth.\n\n\"Great figure,\" Zhou Ze continued. \"Solid, full of flavor, just like the noodles I just ate.\"\n\nThe owner took a heavy drag from his cigarette.\n\n\"How is she in bed?\" Zhou Ze asked again, this time pushing his luck even further.\n\nThe owner's knuckles whitened as he clenched his fist, but he quickly played it off with a swagger. \"Those legs of hers... they could squeeze a man to death. So strong!\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nThe owner smiled too.\n\n\"Can you handle it?\" Zhou Ze asked again. \"She's at that age where she wants it, right?\"\n\nThe owner pounded his lower back. \"Can't handle it anymore. Not a young buck anymore.\"\n\n\"Then, how about you let me try?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe owner's face went completely black.\n\nHis knuckles cracked audibly.\n\n\"If you can't do it, I can. I'm still young,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself, though the words were somewhat against his conscience. Xu Le's physique, young as it was, felt like it was all show and no go; it wasn't even as well-maintained as Zhou Ze's own body from his previous life.\n\n\"This joke has gone too far, don't you think?\" The owner was still holding back his anger.\n\n\"What if your wife agrees?\" Zhou Ze continued.\n\n\"Was that your wife just now?\" the owner asked, changing the subject.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Are you willing to give her up?\" the owner asked.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then shook his head. Although she was Xu Le's wife, she was now his in name. Zhou Ze was not willing.\n\n\"Then what makes you think I'd be willing?\" the owner retorted.\n\n\"Who knows, maybe you have some special tastes or unusual kinks? There's no shortage of that sort of thing these days, is there?\"\n\n\"Brother, it's been a long time since this old bro has hit someone.\" The owner stood up.\n\n\"Call your wife out. Ask her. I want to hear her say whether she's willing or not.\" Zhou Ze leaned back slightly in his seat and smiled.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The owner took a few steps closer to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You stand here and call for her,\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"You're looking to die!\" The owner lunged forward.\n\n\"Can she come out?\" Zhou Ze asked suddenly.\n\nThe owner froze.\n\nThen, a look of terror appeared on his face, and he stumbled back several steps in fright.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked toward the back room on his own. He lifted the curtain. There was no one inside.\n\nThere was only a human skin, belonging to a woman,\n\nhanging on a clothes hanger.\n\nBecause a breeze had come in when he lifted the curtain,\n\nit stirred gently,\n\ndrifting slowly.\n\n\"How... did you figure it out?\" The owner slowly walked over. No emotion, neither anger nor joy, could be heard in his voice.\n\n\"There's a saying... 'Are you trying to fool a ghost?'\" Zhou Ze turned and looked at the owner. \"That layer of skin you're wearing, shouldn't you be tearing it off by now?\n\nI'm very curious,\n\njust how bored are you,\n\nto be here,\n\nperforming this kind of two-man show.\"",

    "content": "The owner smiled, not looking the least bit provoked. He just seemed to find it somewhat amusing.\n\nA person's disposition and aura are often more credible than their words.\n\n\"Rrrrrip...\"\n\nA crisp, drawn-out sound, like a snake shedding its skin. He began to tear off his own skin.\n\nSimultaneously, the owner's frame and bones began to shrink, and his physique slowly thinned out, like a balloon with a small hole, slowly deflating.\n\nZhou Ze now finally understood why that bowl of noodles had been cooked so mushy.\n\nA \"transformation\" like this did indeed take some time.\n\nHe was still wearing the owner's clothes, apron and all, but his face had changed into that of a somewhat green-looking young man.\n\nThe young man wore a smile on his lips, a natural coquettishness. The curve extending from the corners of his eyes, in particular, seemed capable of scratching that itch deep in the hearts of any man or woman nearby—just right, perfectly so.\n\nTo describe a man as \"coquettish\" is a bit dissonant, but some men are truly born with an alluring bone. Among the emperors of old, for instance, countless favored male companions, and the reason was that some men were, in fact, more womanly than women.\n\n\"Am I good-looking?\" the young man asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt the nausea he had just suppressed after eating the noodles come rushing back. He waved a hand apologetically, then clutched his chest, striking a pose that said, *I can't vomit*.\n\n*Who knows that of the food on one's plate, every grain comes from hard toil!*\n\nZhou Ze knew how to cherish his food, especially food that he had managed to swallow with great difficulty and was about to be digested into energy for his body.\n\nThe young man sat down on a nearby chair, casually flicking a lighter in his hand.\n\nHe was sizing up Zhou Ze, because Zhou Ze had seen through him. He had thought his imitation was seamless, and given the setting of a small diner, he didn't think there would be any problems.\n\nMost importantly, he was imitating his own parents.\n\nEver since he was young, he had been observing his parents. Their every move, every subtle expression, was long since engraved in his heart.\n\n\"How did you find me out?\" the young man couldn't help but ask.\n\n\"You're not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked at the same time.\n\nThe young man frowned slightly. He thought Zhou Ze was mocking him, accusing him of playing tricks and pretending to be a ghost.\n\nBut in reality, Zhou Ze had assumed he was a ghost from the very beginning.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to meddle in other people's business. As someone who had recently been fretting over the cost of a freezer, Zhou Ze didn't think he was in any position to meddle.\n\nBut this was meddling he couldn't avoid.\n\nThe business was happening right next door.\n\nSo Zhou Ze felt that, no matter what, it was best to just get things out in the open. If it was easy to solve, he'd solve it. If not, worst-case scenario, he would just move again.\n\n\"Your fingernails,\" Zhou Ze said. \"I'm a bit sensitive when it comes to fingernails.\"\n\nThe proprietress had brought the noodles to him.\n\nThe owner had personally handed him a cigarette.\n\nThe fingernails had been right in front of him.\n\nAlthough the fingers differed in thickness, fairness, and calluses, the patterns on the nailbeds were identical.\n\nAnd lately, Zhou Ze had been paying even more attention to fingernails—not just his own, but others' as well.\n\nThe young man's eyes narrowed slightly. He looked crestfallen. The details hadn't been good enough.\n\nAlthough he had been careless, the fact that he was discovered was indeed his own failing.\n\n\"You're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nIf he was human, then this was truly a bit over the top.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze hadn't seen many ghosts. Not counting his journey in Hell, the number of ghosts he had encountered in the mortal world could be counted on one hand.\n\n\"Skin Painting is my family's ancestral art.\" The young man stood up, reached out, and grabbed Zhou Ze's hand, placing it on his chest. \"It's just that the line was broken for many generations. It was only with my generation that we could pick it up again.\"\n\nThe gesture was a bit intimate, a bit out of line, but Zhou Ze still squeezed subconsciously.\n\nZhou Ze would never believe that Dr. Lin's constant refusal to let him sleep with her had caused him to develop an interest in men.\n\nOf course, the man before him was indeed more alluring than a woman. That was a fact.\n\n\"No bones?\" An expression of surprise appeared on Zhou Ze's face. \"No, it's osteomalacia.\"\n\nOsteomalacia, also known as rickets, is caused by a calcium deficiency that obstructs bone calcification, making the bones soft and easily deformed. Zhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he naturally knew a thing or two. But just as even a common cold has many variations and different pathologies, osteomalacia also has many sub-categories, and the young man before him must be an extreme case.\n\nLegend has it, as recorded in the unofficial histories of the Spring and Autumn Period, that a prince of the State of Lu suffered from this disease. He was like a man without bones, his body pliant. He could walk like a person, and he could also crawl like a snake.\n\n\"You can think of it as a genetic disease. It requires a certain probability to manifest. For many generations, my family couldn't master Skin Painting because they didn't have this disease. But I...\"\n\nThe young man smiled and didn't continue.\n\n\"So, you're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze was still not convinced.\n\n\"My name is Xu Qinglang,\" the young man answered very seriously.\n\n\"And who were you imitating?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My dad, and mom.\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment, a wry smile on his face.\n\nAlright then.\n\nThis was a huge misunderstanding.\n\nEarlier, after finishing the noodles, Miss Lin had left, and Zhou Ze, wanting to expose the truth, had deliberately provoked him. He never expected that the guy was just playing a role-playing game out of boredom, commemorating his deceased parents.\n\nBut from Zhou Ze's perspective before, he had just assumed that this was a ghost, like the ghost from the story *Painted Skin*, who killed people, flayed them, and was now \"a monkey in a hat and gown.\"\n\n\"Well... my apologies, then.\"\n\n*Making a crack about your mom... that really is a bit embarrassing.*\n\n\"I'm not angry,\" Xu Qinglang said. \"But I am very curious. You kept taking me for a ghost. What was that about?\"\n\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"Have you seen a ghost?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I am a ghost,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Xu Qinglang very earnestly.\n\nHis expression was serious, his countenance solemn.\n\nHe was bearing his soul.\n\nXu Qinglang's face froze.\n\nThen, unable to contain it, he let out a \"Pfft\" of laughter.\n\nThe way he looked at Zhou Ze...\n\n...was as if he were looking at an idiot.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Sometimes, that's just how it is. You tell them the truth, and they think you're messing with them and refuse to believe it.\n\n\"In any case, I apologize. By the way, I wanted to ask, was that human skin real human skin?\" Zhou Ze asked curiously.\n\n\"Fish skin,\" Xu Qinglang replied. \"Processed, painted, and crafted.\"\n\n\"Then why are you selling noodles?\" Zhou Ze couldn't understand. \"I heard that a fish-skin coat from the Hezhen people can sell for a lot of money, sold as art. Your work should be worth even more, right?\"\n\n\"It's an ancestral heirloom. I can't bring myself to use it for profit.\"\n\n\"Then you must be very rich,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"My family's home was just demolished,\" Xu Qinglang didn't answer directly. \"We got over twenty apartments in compensation.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nSo, the world really was this unfair. In his past life, he had worked his fingers to the bone at the hospital and had barely earned a thing, while this guy just casually ends up with over twenty apartments.\n\nTongcheng wasn't Shanghai, but property prices were still close to ten thousand yuan per square meter.\n\nA *chai'er'dai*¹... so envious.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Are you going to keep making noodles in the future?\"\n\n\"Are you going to keep selling books in the future?\"\n\nThe two of them asked each other a question at the same time.\n\n\"I'll see how it goes for now,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Same here.\"\n\n\"Well, see you around. By the way, does your sour plum juice come in other flavors?\" Zhou Ze was very curious about this. \"Like, bitter melon flavor? Grape flavor?\"\n\n\"I have the secret recipe. I can make them,\" Xu Qinglang said honestly.\n\n\"Excellent.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\nDamn.\n\nLike cotton.\n\nSo soft. He really was pliable, truly boneless. If you held him in your arms in bed...\n\nZhou Ze immediately conjured an image of Dr. Lin emerging from the shower in her pajamas in his mind, forcibly suppressing that dissonant thought.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the noodle shop.\n\nXu Qinglang went into the back room, lifted the curtain, and said to the female human skin hanging inside:\n\n\"Mom, do you think he really believed me or was he faking it?\"\n\nThe female skin swayed gently,\n\nrocking slightly,\n\nas if to say, *he didn't believe you*,\n\nand also as if to say, *she didn't know either*.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze returned to his store. The freezer was already set up. The next step was to renovate the dilapidated bookstore Xu Le had left behind. Letting it continue to lose money like this was not a solution.\n\nThe sign at the entrance read \"Xu Le's Bookstore,\" and it was as tacky as could be.\n\nIn short, in that guy's hands, this bookstore, from top to bottom, inside and out, exuded an aura of \"guaranteed to lose money.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down at the computer and tried several times to log into his original QQ account, but he couldn't. He couldn't pass the identity verification, and filing an appeal was basically impossible.\n\nAfterward, Zhou Ze had no choice but to go out and take a taxi. He planned to get a new sign, or maybe a pair of couplets for the doorway.\n\nHe knew a man who ran a plaque shop, specializing in wood-carved signs. The owner was an old man who often donated to that orphanage. Back when Zhou Ze himself was a member of the orphanage, the old man was already donating. After Zhou Ze started working, he and the old man donated together.\n\nThe plaque shop wasn't far, located at the foot of Langshan Mountain. It was surrounded on all sides by shops selling incense and candles; only this one sold plaques.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked in, he found the shop in the middle of a major clean-out. Even the main plaque had been taken down.\n\nA middle-aged man was there, directing workers.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" the man asked upon seeing Zhou Ze approach.\n\n\"I'm looking for Old Mr. Zhao,\" Zhou Ze said. He held the old man in high esteem.\n\n\"I'm sorry, my father passed away last month,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"He's gone?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised, and also saddened. He and Old Mr. Zhao weren't actually close; they just knew of each other. So it was perfectly normal that he hadn't been notified of the funeral.\n\nBesides, for Old Mr. Zhao's family, he had always donated the income from his plaque-making to the orphanage. They naturally wouldn't have a favorable impression of the orphanage and might not even inform them of the funeral, fearing the orphanage would come asking them for money.\n\n\"Are you here to order a plaque?\" the middle-aged man asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"My family, we're not making them anymore,\" the middle-aged man said apologetically. \"We'll be selling incense and candles from now on.\"\n\nLangshan Mountain was one of the ten minor sacred mountains of Buddhism. Even if it didn't attract tourists from afar, the locals who came to burn incense and pray on holidays and festivals were enough to let the shops at the foot of the mountain make a fortune.\n\nThis was another form of living off the land—or in this case, the mountain.\n\n\"That's a shame,\" Zhou Ze said with some regret.\n\nHe decided he would go visit the old man's gravestone.\n\n\"But we still have a few plaques my dad carved a while back. They didn't sell. I don't know why my dad carved them; they weren't custom orders. If you like any of them, I can sell them to you cheap.\" The middle-aged man was planning to dispose of them with the mindset of selling off scrap.\n\n\"Alright, I'll take a look,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nHe followed the middle-aged man into the small courtyard behind the shop. The man opened a storeroom and switched on the light.\n\nInside were various odds and ends, including Old Mr. Zhao's tools, all piled up haphazardly, signifying that the younger generation had no intention of inheriting this craft.\n\nNowadays, everyone wanted illuminated signs. Who would want to use these? It was hard work and didn't even make much money.\n\n\"Whoosh...\" The middle-aged man blew on the few plaques on the floor. \"Take a look. Two hundred yuan apiece. If you see one you like, you can take it. If not, no big deal.\"\n\nClearly, the middle-aged man wasn't very confident about getting rid of these plaques.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to look.\n\nThe first plaque read:\n\n\"Life and death are ordained by fate; wealth and honor are decreed by Heaven.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. The middle-aged man sighed, knowing this one was a no-go.\n\nThe next one read:\n\n\"Men know the terror of ghosts, but ghosts know the poison in men's hearts.\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a second. This one hit a little close to home for him.\n\nThe middle-aged man didn't sigh this time, because he knew it was a definite no-go. What kind of business owner would be crazy enough to hang this at their entrance?\n\nThe third one:\n\n\"Take this with a grain of salt; thus have I heard.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze smile, the middle-aged man smiled too.\n\nAt least one had found a taker.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Chai'er'dai (拆二代):** A modern Chinese term for the \"demolition second generation,\" referring to people who became wealthy after their family's old home was demolished by the government for urban development, for which they received massive compensation, often in the form of multiple new apartments and cash.",

    "content": "Having brought the plaques back, Zhou Ze planned to nail them up on either side of the entrance. He wasn't particular about which one went on the left and which on the right.\n\nThe young man next door, Xu Qinglang, was very friendly.\n\nHe had been squatting by his doorway peeling garlic, but when he saw Zhou Ze about to hang the plaques, he went straight into his own place and came out with a hammer and nails.\n\nZhou Ze said thanks. As he took the hammer, he noted it felt a bit greasy and heavy. Suppressing a slight feeling of discomfort, he proceeded to nail up the two plaques.\n\nAfterward,\n\nthe two of them took a few steps back to look at the plaques, the door, the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze handed Xu Qinglang a cigarette as a thank you. Xu Qinglang helped Zhou Ze light it.\n\nThey both exhaled rings of smoke,\n\nin perfect sync.\n\n\"Gives it a certain mood, don't you think?\" Zhou Ze said, a textbook case of patting himself on the back.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"If I'm not mistaken, those two lines are from the chapter titles of Ji Yun's *Yuewei Cottage Notes*.\"\n\n*Yuewei Cottage Notes* was a book of stories written by Ji Yun, also known as Ji Xiaolan, similar to *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*. It used tales of fox spirits, ghosts, and monsters to express the author's own ideas.\n\nTo put it simply, the couplet meant: *These are just stories I've heard; you who are here, just listen and take them as they are.*\n\n\"Mmm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Still too artsy. This shop of yours is still going to lose money.\" Xu Qinglang's assessment was blunt.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"In this world, there are too many stories. Strange and bizarre things happen every day, but not many of them are actually interesting to people.\n\nSome stories are boring to tell.\n\nSome stories you're not allowed to tell at all.\n\nSome stories no one will listen to unless you change them.\n\nAnd some stories, no one would dare to listen to unless you change them.\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at Xu Qinglang for a long, long time.\n\nXu Qinglang lowered his head slightly, his face flushing red.\n\nHe was, by nature, a man who carried himself with a feminine charm, an innate coquettishness. At this moment, he was so stunningly beautiful it was almost unreal.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze remain silent, Xu Qinglang continued:\n\n\"Take all this talk of mountain sprites, fox spirits, ghosts, and monsters—where do you really find them in the real world?\" Xu Qinglang yawned. \"And how true can the moral of a fabricated story really be?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to stare at Xu Qinglang, not saying a word.\n\nXu Qinglang started to feel his scalp tingle under the gaze,\n\nbut Zhou Ze just kept staring at him.\n\nFinally, Xu Qinglang waved his hands dismissively, said he had to go back to make his soup base, and walked back to his noodle shop. He felt as if there were thorns on his back, because in that moment, it was as if Zhou Ze wasn't looking at him,\n\nbut at a joke.\n\nZhou Ze paid no mind to Xu Qinglang. Since they were neighbors, it was best to just let the well water and river water keep to themselves.¹ Besides, they weren't in competition with each other, and most importantly, Zhou Ze didn't have the money to move.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze sorted out most of the textbooks and study guides in the bookstore and sold them to a scrap collector for the price of waste paper.\n\nHe then went to the supermarket and bought ten small plastic chairs. The only two remaining bookshelves held books that Zhou Ze himself found somewhat interesting.\n\nAt the moment, it was less a bookstore and more a senior citizens' recreation center.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He wasn't very good at running a business; right now, he was just messing around blindly. Anyway, the store had been constantly losing money when Xu Le was around, so he didn't feel any pressure.\n\nGoing up to the small second floor, Zhou Ze switched on the power to the chest freezer and set the temperature. He went outside to smoke a cigarette and waited a while before reaching into the freezer to feel it.\n\nThe temperature was about right. Zhou Ze lay down inside.\n\nA freezer that cost over ten thousand yuan naturally had many features, such as a timer function, which served as Zhou Ze's alarm clock.\n\nHe closed the freezer lid.\n\nZhou Ze placed his hands on his lower abdomen, lying perfectly straight.\n\nHe looked…\n\nlike he had passed away peacefully.\n\n...\n\nLate at night,\n\na red car pulled over on the road in front of the bookstore. The whole street was somewhat deserted; on that side of the block, only the adjacent noodle shop and bookstore still had their lights on.\n\nInside the car sat a well-dressed girl in a black down jacket, with shoulder-length hair. She looked cute and delicate.\n\n\"Xiao Bai, you asshole! I prepped for three days, and today you tell me you're away on a business trip? You can go to hell, get lost!\"\n\nThe girl hung up the phone and sat fuming in the driver's seat.\n\nThe Corgi in the passenger seat jumped onto her lap. Its coat was lustrous and flowing, a clear sign of a good breed that was very well cared for.\n\n\"It's okay, at least I still have you with me.\"\n\nThe girl lit a cigarette, extending her hand out the window to flick the ash. Her gaze drifted outside and fell upon the bookstore. What was key was that through the glass window, she could see the interior was set up unusually, with not many bookshelves but rather rows of plastic stools.\n\nGetting out of the car, the girl walked towards the bookstore, holding her Corgi. She didn't want to spend this Valentine's night driving around aimlessly by herself; she wanted to find a quiet place to sit for a while.\n\nThe bookstore door was unlocked. Stepping inside, she could feel the warm air from the heater.\n\nThe girl, leading her dog, first picked a random magazine from a shelf, then sat down on one of the plastic chairs.\n\nShe let the Corgi off its leash, and the little guy began to \"explore\" the shop.\n\nAfter flipping through the magazine, the girl stretched lazily. Feeling a bit thirsty, she called out:\n\n\"Owner, are you here? Do you have any milk tea or coffee?\"\n\nThe girl stood up, put the magazine back, and picked up an illustrated edition of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. After she sat down again, she couldn't help but call out once more:\n\n\"Hey, owner! Are you dead or something? What kind of way is this to run a shop in the middle of the night?\"\n\nA small sign hanging on the glass door read \"Now Open, Welcome.\" The door was open, the heat was on; it was definitely still open for business.\n\nIf the girl had been a little less polite or a bit more curious at that moment and had gone up to the second floor to take a look, she might have been impressed by her own prophetic words.\n\nIn the cramped space of the second floor, there was indeed an ice coffin.\n\nThe owner was lying inside, truly like a dead person.\n\nNo,\n\nthe owner was, in fact, already a dead man.\n\nOf course, the girl probably wouldn't have had time to be impressed before she was scared out of her wits.\n\nA normal person enters a shop late at night only to find the owner lying in a freezing ice coffin—creepy enough, right?\n\nThe girl lit another cigarette, growing impatient, and took out her phone to play with.\n\nJust then, the sound of footsteps came from the top of the stairs. Zhou Ze hadn't woken up because of the girl's shouts; he had woken up naturally.\n\nAs soon as he came down the stairs, Zhou Ze saw a small yellow figure dart towards his legs, begging to be held.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and bent down, scooping the Corgi into his arms. The little guy wasn't shy at all, acting familiar with everyone.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze notice the woman sitting in the shop.\n\nOh,\n\nthe first customer since reopening.\n\nBut he wasn't as excited as he might have imagined. All he'd done today was change the bookstore's sign and clear out the interior.\n\nHe still hadn't figured out\n\nhow to make money.\n\n\"Do you have coffee here, owner?\"\n\nthe girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at a water dispenser in the corner, where disposable paper cups were stacked.\n\nThe girl looked a bit helpless, but she got up anyway, poured herself a glass of water, and returned to her plastic stool.\n\nOne owner, one customer,\n\na silent understanding between them.\n\nAfter about half an hour of silence, the girl started scrolling through Weibo and watching videos. One video was particularly loud and boisterous:\n\n\"Step right up, don't miss out!\n\nHell money, consecrated by this old Taoist, limited supply!\n\nYou can burn it now and withdraw it for your own use when you get down there, and you can even earn some interest—higher interest than any savings account!²\n\nYou can also burn it for your relatives in the underworld. Fast and convenient, honest with young and old alike, no hassle from ghostly bailiffs, and no hidden fees skimmed off the top!\"\n\nThe girl laughed when she saw the video. People often have an instinct to share something funny they've found. She looked up at the owner sitting behind the counter and said:\n\n\"Owner, have you seen this video? This old Taoist's livestream is pretty famous. He's practically an internet celebrity.\"\n\n\"Oh, a livestream?\" Zhou Ze was a bit puzzled. He took out his phone. Xu Le's phone had a ton of livestreaming apps; it seemed the guy was really bored in his daily life, either watching livestreams or writing sequels to *Bai Jie*.³\n\n\"Yeah, search for his ID. It's hilarious. I think he runs a funeral supplies store in Chengdu, but he hasn't streamed in a long time.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened an app and searched for the old Taoist's ID as the girl suggested. A stream room popped up—*The streamer is away.*\n\nLuckily, he could watch past broadcasts. Zhou Ze randomly clicked on a video from a month ago.\n\nIn the video, the old Taoist had his phone propped up in a fixed position while he practiced shadowboxing. His form was good; you could tell he was a trained practitioner. In the frame, a young man sat there, a slight smile on his lips, eyes narrowed as if watching a monkey show.\n\nZhou Ze perfunctorily scrubbed through the timeline. The frame then showed another man, sitting behind a counter, holding a spoon, seemingly eating congee.\n\nThe old Taoist was holding forth in the main part of the video, relentlessly promoting himself and the hell money he sold on Taobao, but Zhou Ze's gaze was subconsciously drawn to the man in the corner of the screen.\n\nHe was frowning, he was in agony, he was in pain, he was fighting it.\n\nOne spoonful of congee,\n\nhe ate it with great difficulty.\n\nThen he continued with a second spoonful,\n\nas if he were being tortured.\n\nWatching this, Zhou Ze took a deep breath, as if he himself had been infected by the man in the corner of the video.\n\nEating…\n\nit really isn't an easy thing to do.\n\nHe didn't know the identity of the man in the video, but he felt a flicker of instinctual interest. Was the man an anorexia patient? Or did he have some kind of gastrointestinal disease?\n\nAfter the video ended, Zhou Ze opened the page. On a whim, using Xu Le's logged-in account, he sent a direct message to the old Taoist:\n\n\"Who's the man sitting in the back eating congee in the video?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm leaving. How much?\" The girl stood up and stretched. \"If I told anyone what I did tonight, they'd think I was an idiot. Spending Valentine's night sitting in a bookstore reading *Dream of the Red Chamber* for so long.\"\n\n\"Pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe customer had only read for a while and poured herself a glass of plain water.\n\nThe girl glanced at Zhou Ze. \"Owner, you've got a good routine here. Just like those masters in temples who interpret fortunes.\n\nThere's a sign by the prayer cushion that says 'Free Fortune Interpretation,' but after the tourist gets their fortune and has it interpreted, the master pulls out a red donation book for you, filled with a long list of names and donation amounts, with the lowest being a hundred.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, neither confirming nor denying.\n\nThe girl took out a hundred-yuan bill and placed it on the chair she had been sitting on. Then, holding her Corgi, she pushed open the bookstore door and left.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, picked up the hundred-yuan bill, and flicked it with his thumb.\n\nA crisp snap.\n\nIt was one of the most wonderful sounds in the world.\n\nWhen he walked back to the counter, Zhou Ze noticed his phone screen had lit up. He opened it and saw there was a reply. It was a private message back from the old Taoist. The reply was very simple:\n\n\"Gone!\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"Let the well water and river water keep to themselves\"**: A direct translation of the Chinese idiom 井水不犯河水 (jǐngshuǐ bùfàn héshuǐ), meaning to stay out of each other's affairs or to live and let live.\n2.  **Yu'e Bao**: Mentioned in the original text, Yu'e Bao (餘額寶) is a very popular money-market fund integrated into Alipay, China's largest mobile payment platform.

    "content": "For the entire evening, there had been only one customer. The total income was one hundred yuan, but the cost was merely a glass of water.\n\nOf course, you could argue there were also costs like electricity and rent...\n\nBut you can’t really calculate it that way. When Xu Le was here before, those were costs too, but his income was practically negligible. A person has to find the right point of comparison to gain a sliver of satisfaction and confidence in life.\n\nAlso, it was only because of that girl with the corgi that Zhou Ze found out it was actually Valentine's Day.\n\nHe scrolled through WeChat, found Dr. Lin's contact, and tapped on it. Zhou Ze wanted to send her a red envelope. He tried to send 1314 yuan, but realized he didn't have enough money. He had enough for 131.4 yuan, but sending that amount felt a bit petty.¹\n\n*Besides, it's not like she sleeps with me.*\n\n*Forget it.*\n\n*I'm not sending it.*\n\nTossing his phone aside, Zhou Ze grabbed a random book and started flipping through it, holding that pose until morning.\n\nHe went next door for wontons. Whether the wrappers were thin or the filling was thick, Zhou Ze had no idea. He ate the same way as before: after downing a large bowl of plum juice, he would immediately wolf down his food, then clutch his own throat and take deep, continuous breaths to suppress the urge to vomit.\n\nThe thought that every meal he ate from now on would have to follow this procedure made Zhou Ze feel as though a shadow had been cast over his future.\n\nZhou Ze thought again of the man in the video, painfully drinking congee. He felt a wave of misery. Eating, originally one of life's greatest pleasures, was now something they were completely cut off from.\n\nHe wondered if there was an \"Anorexics' Club\" somewhere in the world, where everyone would gather around a table, and whoever managed to eat a bite of food first would get a collective thumbs-up from the others:\n\n\"You're so amazing!\n\nMy guy is so incredible!\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. The image was somewhat blood-curdling.\n\nIn any case, yesterday's video, including the old Daoist priest and the man drinking congee, felt too distant for Zhou Ze for the time being.\n\nAfter Valentine's Day came New Year's Eve, the 30th of the lunar month.² Normally, this shopping center would be festooned with lanterns and decorations, brimming with a festive New Year's spirit. But in reality, it remained the same as always—cold and deserted.\n\nIt was like a life.\n\nIf you've had your days of glory, you will naturally have your days of desolation.\n\nZhou Ze remembered when this shopping center first opened; its popularity was unrivaled for a time. Now, it was utterly neglected.\n\nXu Qinglang's business was booming today, likely because many other shops were closed. As someone who insisted on doing deliveries even on New Year's Eve, he naturally received more orders. After all, the customers' options had dwindled.\n\nDelivery drivers in blue, yellow, or red uniforms constantly bustled in and out of his noodle shop. Zhou Ze squatted at the entrance of his own bookstore, smoking a cigarette and sighing with emotion.\n\n*That son... of a... bitch Xu Le. He should've just opened a Yellow Braised Chicken place back then.*\n\nIn myths, immortals were fond of saying, \"A day in heaven is a year on earth.\"\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze felt this was probably right, and it applied equally to hell.\n\nHe remembered when he died in the car crash... no, that's not right. He remembered when he was sent into the incinerator to be burned, it should have been just after June 1st, Children's Day. And now, in the blink of an eye, it was New Year's Eve.\n\nMore than half a year had passed so quickly. A floating life is but a dream, nothing more than a muddled journey halfway down the Yellow Springs Road.³\n\nAfter smoking quite a few cigarettes and thinking quite a few thoughts, Zhou Ze felt a bit tired. He took out his phone, wanting to see what movies were out recently. The cinema was right next door; he could go there to kill some time.\n\n\"Hey, you got any newspapers over at your place?\" asked Xu Qinglang, stepping out after a busy spell of sending off the last batch of delivery drivers.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To paper the walls,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"That frugal?\"\n\n\"Newspaper on the walls creates a certain atmosphere, a vintage feel. You didn't sell them all yesterday, did you?\"\n\n\"There are still some left. Wait, I'll go find them for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze went back into the store and, from a box on the second floor next to his freezer, brought down a stack of newspapers half a man's height. He went downstairs and gave them to the waiting Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"You're not going home for the New Year either?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Spending the New Year with my books.\"\n\nIt was a pity Zhou Ze didn't have a goatee, nor any wine in his hand.\n\nOtherwise, he could have raised a large cup to toast this incredibly classy line.⁴\n\n\"You're not going home either, are you?\" Zhou Ze asked after reveling in his own coolness for a moment.\n\n\"With over twenty properties, which home am I supposed to go back to?\" Xu Qinglang sighed.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two fell silent for a moment. Then Zhou Ze spoke up, \"Let me tell you a story.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Xu Qinglang nodded, his expression slightly reserved. His hair was a little long, and a few strands drooped, brushing against the corner of his mouth. He reached up and gently pushed the hair away. His posture was so delicate, he was truly shy and charming.\n\nSuch charm was not for outsiders to comprehend.\n\n\"Once upon a time, also on New Year's Day, a man ran into the richest man in town late at night on the road.\n\nThe rich man was dead drunk.\n\nThe man asked the tycoon, 'Why don't you go home?'\n\nThe tycoon replied, 'Home? Where is my home? My family and relatives aren't by my side. The home you speak of, is it that mansion of mine, the largest in the city?'\"\n\nAfter hearing the story, Xu Qinglang nodded slightly, seeming to deeply relate.\n\n\"Then the man pinned the tycoon to the ground and beat him mercilessly, shouting:\n\n'That'll teach you to come out on New Year's showing off and acting all smug!'\"\n\nZhou Ze finished the story.\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe conversation between the two ended.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore. The heat was on, making it warm and cozy. He fiddled with his phone, but there was no one he could contact.\n\nHe had considered visiting the orphanage, but then thought better of it. He didn't have much money left.\n\nBut just then, a customer arrived. It was a young man in blue work clothes and a hard hat. He pushed open the bookstore door and walked in, asking somewhat timidly:\n\n\"Can I... read books here? How much is it?\" The man pursed his lips.\n\n\"Go ahead. Pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said, waving his hand to indicate the man could do as he pleased.\n\n\"That's great. Do you have any novels here?\" the young man said, a bit reservedly. \"I like to read novels, the online kind.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a box behind a bookshelf. \"They're all over there.\"\n\nThe man walked over to the box and rummaged through it, looking very pleased. Some of the books were still in their plastic wrap.\n\n\"Go ahead and open them. No charge,\" Zhou Ze said generously.\n\n\"Alrighty.\"\n\nThe young man unwrapped an online novel, then sat down on a plastic stool and began to read.\n\nAs the owner, Zhou Ze sat behind the counter, trimming his nails. The young man just sat there reading. About half an hour later, the young man stood up from his stool, took out his cigarettes, and offered one to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"It's not a good brand, hope you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Heh, cigarettes are no good for you anyway. Why distinguish between good and bad?\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette. The man took one for himself and proactively walked outside the shop door to light it, smoking while standing in the cold wind.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze, who had been about to smoke inside, pause for a moment. He thought about it, then decided against it, setting the cigarette aside and continuing to trim his nails.\n\nAfter finishing his smoke outside, the young man came back in. This time, he didn't sit on the plastic stool but leaned against the wall and sat on the floor.\n\nAlthough the air conditioner was on, the floor tiles were still very cold. The young man, however, paid it no mind, likely being used to it from his daily life.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, four more men in clean, well-washed blue work clothes walked up to the shop. The oldest looked to be no more than thirty, while the youngest was perhaps only about seventeen.\n\nThe four of them came in together. The young man leaning against the wall waved at them; he must have been the one who called them over.\n\nThe newcomers greeted Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze gave a perfunctory reply and continued to trim his nails.\n\nZhou Ze decided he needed to buy a professional nail care kit. Only then could he do his nails justice.\n\nBut with express deliveries suspended and most physical stores closed, he could only put the idea aside for now.\n\nWhen he looked up again, Zhou Ze saw that all five of the workers were sitting on the floor, each holding a novel.\n\nFrom the covers, he could tell they were all online novels, mostly of the fantasy genre. One was holding a horror novel, biting his nails as he read, clearly engrossed.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze couldn't quite approve of the nail-biting.\n\n*A person who knows how to cherish their nails knows how to cherish life, after all.*\n\nFrom time to time, someone would laugh while reading, a genuine laugh straight from the heart.\n\nThe bookstore was full of people, but it was quiet. There was an occasional small sound, but it wasn't disturbing.\n\nWhen evening came, Xu Qinglang walked in carrying a bowl of dumplings. As soon as he entered, he said:\n\n\"Well now, it's quite lively in here.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Hey brothers, want something to eat?\" Xu Qinglang asked the workers sitting in the shop.\n\nThey looked at each other, at a loss.\n\n\"Forget it, my treat.\" Xu Qinglang was, after all, a man with over twenty properties. \"It's New Year's, and it's not easy for you guys to be away from home. We're all out here trying to make a living. We're all brothers, no matter where we're from.\"\n\n\"Well then, thank you, boss. May you get rich,\" said the oldest worker, standing up to thank Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"It's what I should do, what I should do.\"\n\nXu Qinglang set down Zhou Ze's dumplings and went back to his own shop.\n\nZhou Ze drank a little of the broth, then forced down two dumplings. That damn Xu Qinglang had forgotten to bring him plum juice, so he couldn't eat more.\n\nTaking out the cigarettes on the counter, Zhou Ze walked out from behind it.\n\n\"When you finish one, just grab another. I should have the full sets of whatever I have here. Anyway, this shop is a money-losing business, so don't be polite with me.\"\n\nZhou Ze passed out cigarettes one by one.\n\nThe workers accepted them, one after another, as if receiving a great honor.\n\nThen they all got up, walked out the shop door together, and squatted in a row to smoke.\n\nThey didn't want to dirty the environment inside the shop.\n\nZhou Ze thought for a moment, then also stepped outside the shop. The wind was a bit cold out there. He squatted down beside them and smoked along.\n\nThe workers chatted.\n\nThe married ones talked about their wives and kids.\n\nThe unmarried ones talked about girls they knew in Tongcheng or back in their hometowns.\n\nThey joked with each other.\n\nThey teased each other.\n\nEven though they all knew each other's stories, there was still plenty to talk about.\n\nJudging by their accents, this group of workers was from all over the country, not from the same village.\n\nTongcheng was near Shanghai, part of the Yangtze River Delta region. Although it couldn't compare to Shanghai in scale, the demand for labor here was still huge every year. As long as you were willing to work hard, you wouldn't have trouble finding a job or making money.\n\nAfter two more rounds of cigarettes were passed around, Zhou Ze spoke up, \"Brothers, are you really not going home to see your families for the New Year?\"\n\n\"Nah, not going back. Everyone at home is fine.\"\n\n\"It's a lot of trouble to go back and forth. There's still work to do during the first month of the year, and the boss will even give out red envelopes. It'd be a waste not to take them, and we can send more money back home.\"\n\n\"Haha, today's been great. We've got novels to read and cigarettes to smoke. This New Year's has some flavor to it.\"\n\n\"Boss, when are you closing up?\" one of the workers asked.\n\n\"I'm not closing,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"The boss isn't going home?\"\n\n\"The missus at home won't listen, so I'm not going back.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a surge of heroic spirit piercing the heavens!\n\nAll the workers gave Zhou Ze a thumbs-up, cheering him on.\n\nOf course, no one pressed the matter. They could tell from his accent, and besides, Zhou Ze ran a bookstore, not a fruit stand. The workers guessed he was a local.\n\nFor a local to be minding his shop on New Year's Eve instead of going home, there had to be a reason. So, they didn't continue to joke or tease him about it.\n\nBesides, they were each the pillars of their own families. They came out to work and earn money, while their wives back home took care of the elderly and the children. They worked hard, they were tired, but their wives were too.\n\nLife is something you endure, something you suffer through, generation after generation. Whose life is ever easy?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to pass out more cigarettes, a voice called out from a distance:\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and stood. Only then did he notice a Porsche Cayenne parked on the other side of the road. A familiar car.\n\nRight, his wife's car.\n\nThe one who shouted was his sister-in-law. She had indeed been terrified by Zhou Ze in the bathroom a while back, but she was back to normal now. She couldn't possibly believe her brother-in-law was a ghost, so she had chalked it up to her eyes playing tricks on her in a moment of fright.\n\nOf course, she couldn't possibly have a good temper towards Zhou Ze. After all, he had scared her so badly she'd wet herself. How embarrassing!\n\n\"Xu Le, come home for dinner!\" the sister-in-law shouted.\n\n\"Not going back. It's busy here at the shop, and very lively,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand.\n\n*What a joke.*\n\n*Go back on New Year's Eve to see those god-awful in-laws again?*\n\n*Put up with this bratty sister-in-law's attitude?*\n\n*And most importantly,*\n\n*Rush home on New Year's Eve just to sleep in separate beds?*\n\n*Am I looking for trouble?*\n\n\"Sis, is this guy nuts? He's unreasonable, just plain weird, and so stubborn!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law pouted from the back seat.\n\nDr. Lin smiled. \"Let's go home and have dinner with Mom and Dad first.\"\n\n\"Ooh, hearing that, does that mean you plan to come out tonight, sis?\"\n\n\"After all, I am his... legal wife.\" Dr. Lin said no more, started the car, and drove away.\n\nWatching the car leave, Zhou Ze shouted to the workers beside him, \"Hey brothers, isn't my wife a looker?\"\n\n\"A looker!\"\n\n\"You're a lucky man!\"\n\n\"So beautiful!\"\n\n\"Hahahaha.\"\n\nXu Qinglang emerged from his shop holding a large tray.\n\n\"Here we go, braised pork over rice! Come on, brothers, dig in!\"\n\nThe workers were a bit reserved, and also a bit hesitant. The oldest worker said, somewhat embarrassed, \"We went out, we didn't bring any...\"\n\n\"We already agreed, it's my treat for you brothers! If you mention money again, you're not treating me as a brother. We're from all over, who knows when our paths might cross again. There might come a day when I'll need to ask you guys for a favor.\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\n\"Say no more!\"\n\n\"When you come to my hometown...\"\n\n\"Let's go!\"\n\nThe workers all took a large bowl of rice with topping into the bookstore. They all squatted on the floor, placing their bowls on the plastic stools and eating heartily.\n\nOne worker was still trying to read his novel while eating and got a rap on the head with a pair of chopsticks from the worker next to him.\n\n\"You lard-brained fool! If you accidentally get the book dirty, how is the boss supposed to sell it?\"\n\n\"You're right. Eat first.\"\n\nThe atmosphere was very lively. Zhou Ze returned behind his counter. The dumplings were already a bit cold, but he managed to eat three more. This time, for some reason, maybe because of the atmosphere, his feeling of nausea was much less intense than before.\n\nAfter the meal, everyone continued to read.\n\nThe room was warm, there were novels to read, and the atmosphere was harmonious.\n\nWithout realizing it, it was ten o'clock at night.\n\nThe oldest worker stood up, stretched, and said, \"Brothers, it's time. Let's head back. Let's help clean up the place for him.\"\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\nThe five workers helped Zhou Ze clean the entire shop, upstairs and down.\n\n\"Boss, we're leaving now. Thank you for today.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave.\n\nThey left.\n\nUnlike the girl with the corgi from last night, who left a hundred-yuan bill after reading for a while, they had read for a whole day and half the night and hadn't left a single yuan.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't mind at all, nor did he feel the slightest bit of dissatisfaction.\n\nStretching, Zhou Ze was about to call Xu Qinglang over to collect the bowls and chopsticks from his shop. When he walked over to the noodle shop, Zhou Ze saw Xu Qinglang sitting behind a table, reading a newspaper.\n\nRight, the same newspaper Zhou Ze had given him during the day.\n\nXu Qinglang was wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, and he did indeed have a somewhat scholarly air about him. A man with over twenty properties, as expected.\n\nHe had class no matter how you looked at him!\n\n\"The bowls and chopsticks over there, you can clear them away,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright, I'll go right now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and stood up to go next door and collect the tableware.\n\nAt the top of the large stack of newspapers was a copy of the *Yangtze Evening News*. The date showed it was from seven days ago.\n\nOn the front page was a headline in large, bold black type:\n\n**\"Residential Building Fire, A Moving Tale of Heroism\"**\n\nLast week, a fire broke out in a densely populated residential community in Tongcheng. The fire was severe.\n\nFive young construction workers from a nearby site rushed in to save people without regard for the danger. They rescued over twenty elderly people, women, and children in total. But after their last charge into the fire to save people,\n\nthey never came out again.\n\nThe *Yangtze Evening News* cover featured a large photograph.\n\nIt was a group photo of the five men.\n\nThey stood shoulder to shoulder, making an old-fashioned peace sign. It seemed to have been a photo taken when they first arrived at the construction site and were sharing a dormitory.\n\nTheir faces, young but also bearing the faint wrinkles of hardship,\n\nin the photograph,\n\nwere smiling a bit bashfully, but also brilliantly.\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the bookstore.\n\nHe looked at the five bowls of rice with topping placed on the plastic stools.\n\nNot a single bite had been taken. The food had long since gone cold.\n\nIn each bowl of rice, a pair of chopsticks was stuck upright.⁵\n\n\"Brothers,\"\n\n\"Eat well,\"\n\n\"Drink well,\"\n\nXu Qinglang murmured.\n\nOutside, the sound of firecrackers erupted.\n\nFireworks weren't banned in Tongcheng. For a moment, the sky was filled with colorful bursts, exceptionally lively and festive.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head and looked outside.\n\nHe said in a low voice:\n\n\"It's the New Year.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.

    "content": "The sound of firecrackers bid farewell to the old year. After the stroke of midnight, the explosions of fireworks and firecrackers could be heard from all directions, creating a particularly lively and dense cacophony. What had been only sparse and scattered sounds now took on an overwhelming, earth-shattering momentum.\n\nZhou Ze blew on his fingernails. The clamor outside had little to do with him. He had no home—though in name, he now had a \"home,\" he didn't want to go back.\n\nMany people, at some point in their lives, have had the thought of what they would do if they could be reborn.\n\n*To write with passion, to command with flair, to scorn the marquises of yesteryear.*¹\n\nBut when you truly return from hell, you suddenly discover that your former pursuits, your former thoughts, your former aspirations—they're like when a kindergarten teacher asks, \"Children, what do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\nAnd all the children answer together: \"Scientists, doctors, astronauts, soldiers...\"\n\nDreams are always so full.\n\nReality, on the other hand, isn't necessarily gaunt, but a person's rush of fervor is destined to be finite.\n\nSometimes, just being able to breathe, to hear sounds, to sit here and slack off, wasting a bit of time...\n\nPerhaps this is what it truly means for the years to be quiet and good.\n\nXu Qinglang was sleeping at the shop again tonight. Zhou Ze heard him lock the front door.\n\nHe claimed to have over twenty properties, but Zhou Ze knew clearly that his parents were right here in the shop.\n\nA family should be together, neat and tidy.\n\nThis New Year's, it was naturally even more important.\n\nOutside, it began to rain. A damp chill started to seep in, making one feel a bit oppressed.\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang. It was a call from his missus.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\nZhou Ze thought it was a stupid question.\n\n*If I were asleep, who would be answering your call?*\n\n*Could it be a dead man... oh no, a ghost?*\n\n*Wait, something seems off here.*\n\nZhou Ze leaned back slightly in his chair. An image surfaced in his mind of Doctor Lin gently poking his chest with a finger, calling him: \"You ghost, you...\"\n\nIt was the first time he felt that speaking the truth could, for some reason, be so dazzling and mesmerizing.\n\nPerhaps it was because he was too bored, or maybe he was just purely idle, but Zhou Ze found his thoughts starting to wander.\n\nHe was thinking... a bit too much.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"*Creeak...*\"\n\nDoctor Lin pushed open the shop door and walked in. She held a red umbrella, wearing leather pants on the bottom and a white sweater on top, her hair draped over her shoulders.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze forgot to hang up the phone.\n\nThis woman...\n\n...was indeed very beautiful.\n\nEspecially her aura, which always gave you that feeling of \"if life were only like the first time we met,\" stabbing a man's heart in an instant.\n\n\"Afraid I'd be lonely and cold all by myself?\" Zhou Ze stood up and poured a glass of water for Doctor Lin.\n\nShe was the mistress of this place.\n\nWell, to be precise, the money Xu Le had used to open this bookstore had come from her family.\n\nDoctor Lin took the water, shook her head, and said nothing.\n\nThe two of them were husband and wife, but in reality, they were more like the most familiar of strangers, stuck in a position even more awkward than that of a male confidant.\n\nTo take a step forward was difficult.\n\nTo take a step back was even harder.\n\n\"Let's go for a walk,\" Zhou Ze suggested, feeling the room was a bit stuffy. Besides, there was no way he could invite Doctor Lin up to his sleeping quarters on the second floor.\n\nEven if Doctor Lin had taken the wrong medicine today and planned to offer herself to the tiger, the sight of the freezer on his second floor would probably make her immediately dial the number of a familiar psychiatric hospital and have him sent there for some serious rehabilitation.\n\n\"It's raining,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"It's a light rain, it's fine.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand dismissively, relaxed and at ease.\n\n...\n\n\"*Pitter-patter-patter...*\"\n\nThe rain grew heavier. Much heavier.\n\nZhou Ze, who had earlier planned to experience the \"spring rain as precious as oil\" without even grabbing an umbrella, was now soaked like a drowned rat. Doctor Lin still stood to the side, holding her umbrella. Zhou Ze had refused her offer to share it.\n\nThe cool-guy act was his own doing, so he had to see it through, even with tears in his eyes.\n\nPatting his soaking wet hair, Zhou Ze shivered. He wasn't particularly afraid of the cold; in fact, he was quite resistant to freezing. It was just that the woman beside him, despite being mostly dry under her umbrella, was still trembling slightly.\n\nThe bus stop shelter could block most of the rain, but the cold night wind still blew through with impunity.\n\nA romantic mood,\na man and a woman together,\ndrenched on a rainy night,\na beauty in distress...\n\nThis should have been a good opportunity for them to cultivate their feelings, a perfect catalyst. It could even have led to things getting heated, a \"mistake in the flower fields,\"² and perhaps even a one-shot pregnancy. But the two of them stood in mutual silence.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. Doctor Lin just stood beside him.\n\nOne wanted to escape, the other was resistant by nature; naturally, they couldn't find common ground.\n\nWhen you force a melon off the vine, both the melon and the vine feel awkward.\n\nIn his heart, Zhou Ze grumbled a little at Xu Le. If that coward had just forced the issue after they got married, none of this nonsense would be happening now. Even if Doctor Lin were already a married woman or pregnant with a child, she would probably still be devastatingly beautiful, maybe even scoring a few extra points.\n\nAnd he himself could have just gone with the flow. Why was he stuck in this dilemma now?\n\nOf course, this complaint was rather unfair to Xu Le. If Zhou Ze himself had forced the issue that night, would Doctor Lin have fought back desperately, crying \"Indecent assault!\"? And then called the police to have Zhou Ze sent to the Public Security Bureau? Accuse him of rape?\n\nThe rain was still falling.\n\nZhou Ze dropped his cigarette butt on the ground.\n\n\"Did you drive here?\"\n\n\"I took a taxi,\" Doctor Lin replied.\n\n\"I'll see you home.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nThere was no need to dwell on how this seemingly foolish and naive New Year's Eve walk in the rain had started.\n\nAt least, for now, both of them felt that ending it here was the most appropriate thing to do.\n\nThey hailed a ride-sharing car, and Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin got in together.\n\nFifteen minutes later, they arrived. Zhou Ze got out of the car with Doctor Lin. The driver settled the fare and drove off immediately.\n\nHome was just upstairs, but Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin didn't choose to go up right away.\n\nThe scene was a bit like a pair of junior high school sweethearts walking the girl home at night. Now, below her apartment building, it was time to part, lingering in a cloying, lovey-dovey farewell.\n\nBut the atmosphere here was even less rich than that of two awkward middle schoolers. It was like meat broth without salt or MSG—tasteless to eat, but a waste to throw away.\n\n\"You're not coming up?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"I won't. Let's wait a while, and then we'll take care of our business.\"\n\nDoctor Lin understood the meaning behind his words. \"I'm sorry,\" she said.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, then reached out. He had intended to pat her on the shoulder, but once his hand was there, he felt a sudden impulse and pulled her into an embrace instead.\n\nDoctor Lin's body stiffened for a moment, but she didn't resist.\n\nThey drew a little closer, but it wasn't a particularly intimate gesture. Considering their official relationship, it could even be called distant.\n\nShe smelled very nice. He had no idea what brand of shower gel she used, but whatever it was, it was very pleasant.\n\n\"I've always been curious about something. Is there someone else in your heart?\" Zhou Ze added, \"And that 'someone else' could be a man or a woman.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Doctor Lin said, very frankly. She didn't even hesitate.\n\nBefore, her husband had been so timid and shrinking, which made her unable to be ruthless.\n\nNow, her husband seemed like a different person, which also allowed her to shed some of her burdens.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze grunted, his gaze shifting slightly upward, as if to check whether a certain protective color had appeared above his head.\n\nThere was still a sense of disappointment.\n\nYou couldn't call it love.\n\nYou couldn't say he liked her that much.\n\nEven calling them \"familiar\" was a stretch.\n\nBut no matter what, she was, in name, his woman. And in the end, he was still cheated on.\n\nWell, any man...\n\nNo,\n\nany male of any species,\n\nwould probably not be too happy about this kind of thing.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" This was the second time she had said it.\n\nZhou Ze released his hands, and the two slowly separated.\n\n\"Saying sorry makes us sound like strangers.\" Zhou Ze leaned back against a nearby stone bollard. The rain had lightened, and there was a small eave here.\n\n\"I'll give you another sum of money. You can open another bookstore,\" Doctor Lin said, and then added another, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to magnanimously wave his hand and say, \"I don't care about the money.\"\n\nBut then he thought about his freezer, about his future life...\n\nAnd suddenly, Zhou Ze found he couldn't get the words out.\n\nWhat if...\n\nWhat if...\n\nWhat if this woman took him at his word, thought that giving him money was an insult, and then really didn't offer any compensation?\n\n\"Let's talk in a few days,\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"That guy, what's he like?\"\n\n\"He's very handsome, in my eyes,\" Doctor Lin replied.\n\n*So it's a man.*\n\n*Stab.*\n\n*Another twist of the knife.*\n\n*It would have been easier to accept if it were a woman...*\n\nZhou Ze felt as if the photosynthesis above his head had just intensified.\n\n\"There's no chance, is there?\" Zhou Ze asked a very stupid question. He regretted it the moment he asked it, but he consoled himself: *I'm asking this for the pitiful Xu Le.*\n\n*You've taken over the guy's body, and now his wife is cheating. You at least have to help him ask why, right?*\n\n*Yes, that's it.*\n\n\"No chance,\" Doctor Lin's reply was just as swift and certain.\n\nThis woman was also a surgeon. Her style of speaking was truly decisive, like wielding a scalpel—every cut hitting a vital spot, no hemming and hawing.\n\nOtherwise, the patient would only suffer more. It seemed the same logic applied to matters of the heart.\n\n\"Fine, fine. I can't compare, I can't compare. It's fine. We'll each live our own lives. You should go back and deal with your parents,\" Zhou Ze said, feeling a bit vexed.\n\nDoctor Lin nodded, turned, and walked into the building corridor.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, ready to hail a car to leave, but at that moment, an unfamiliar number called his phone.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Sir, I've driven back.\"\n\n\"That's smart of you,\" Zhou Ze said, a little surprised. He recognized the voice of the previous driver.\n\n\"You left a bag on the back seat. I brought it back for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\nThe car pulled up in front of the building again. From the window, the driver handed out a woman's handbag.\n\n\"Please check it.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony. He opened Doctor Lin's bag. Inside was just a phone, a wallet, a charging cable, and a few packs of tissues.\n\nTaking out the wallet, Zhou Ze froze the moment he opened it.\n\nHis gaze was fixed on the photo slot in the wallet.\n\nThere was a picture there.\n\nThe woman in the photo looked very young, even... naive, wearing an ill-fitting white doctor's coat.\n\nAnd the man to the girl's right... Zhou Ze felt a strange sense of unfamiliar familiarity.\n\nHe stared for a good while.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze recognize him.\n\n*Isn't that me?*\n\nIt was a cropped photo, likely from a group picture, but trimmed to show just the two of them.\n\n\"Is anything missing?\" the driver urged.\n\n\"It's all here. Thanks, Master.³ You can go.\"\n\nThe driver drove away.\n\nZhou Ze continued to stare at the wallet, not even thinking to call Doctor Lin and tell her to come down and get her bag.\n\nSome memories, not exactly buried but not often thought about, began to surface.\n\nHe vaguely remembered...\n\nAbout five or six years ago, he had supervised a group of students assigned to the hospital for their internship. There was a girl, her surname seemed to be Lin, and her appearance... seemed to match the girl in the photo.\n\nA girl truly changes between girlhood and womanhood.\n\nA smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nSo Doctor Lin had such an adorkable phase back then. Who knew that five or six years later she would blossom into such a beauty? He really hadn't noticed this girl's potential for development at all.\n\nMoreover, back then, he had been very perfunctory about the hospital making him supervise interns, treating those students purely as \"medical dogs\"⁴ to be worked.\n\nZhou Ze shook the wallet in his hand.\n\n\"Damn it, you deserved to be single until you were almost thirty.\"\n\nThis time, surprisingly, he wasn't cursing Xu Le.\n\nHe was cursing himself.\n\n\"My eyes...\n\n...are truly blind...\"\n\nZhou Ze spread his arms and stretched lazily.\n\nThe one who cuckolded him...\n\n...was actually himself.\n\nAfter the rain, in the early morning of the first day of the New Year.\n\nHeh heh.\n\nHe looked up at the sky.\n\nHe very solemnly patted his own chest.\n\nZhou Ze paused.\n\nAnd said, very seriously:\n\n\"Xu Le, you truly are my good brother!\n\n*As for your wife, I shall raise her myself. You need not worry.*\"⁵\n\n---\n¹ A line from a 1925 poem by Mao Zedong, expressing grand, revolutionary youthful ambition.\n\n² “花田裡犯的錯” (A mistake made in a flower field): A popular euphemism for an illicit affair or sexual encounter, originating from a song.\n\n³ \"師傅\" (Shīfu): A respectful term for a blue-collar worker or skilled tradesman, commonly used for taxi drivers.\n\n⁴ \"醫學狗\" (Yīxué gǒu): Literally \"medical dog.\" A self-deprecating slang term used by medical students and junior doctors in China to describe their grueling, thankless work.\n\n⁵ “汝妻子吾自養之，汝勿慮也” (Rǔ qīzi wú zì yǎng zhī, rǔ wù lǜ yě): A famous, chilling line from the classic novel *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*.
