    "content": "\"Tang Zheng, you pauper, hand over the money you stole!\"\n\n\"I heard a few days ago that your grandfather was sick, you must have stolen money to get treatment for your dead grandpa. Having a pauper like you in our class is a disgrace.\"\n\n\"Do you still think you're the city's number one? Now you're the last place idiot. The school should have expelled you long ago.\"\n\nAccusations and insults continued endlessly. Tang Zheng's face flushed red, he bit his lip tightly, tilted his head back, and said firmly, \"I didn't steal the money!\"\n\n\"Quibbling! If you didn't steal it, who did? You were the only one left in the classroom during the break for physical education. Besides, we are all wealthy people. Why would we care about a few hundred yuan? Only you are a pauper, who else could it be? Do the bills have legs and run away on their own?\"\n\n\"Qiao Fei, you're talking nonsense!\" Tang Zheng's eyes were red. It was true he was poor, and his grandfather, with whom he lived alone, was indeed ill, but he had never stolen since childhood.\n\nHis grandfather had always taught him that even poor people have their dignity, that one must live with one's back straight, without stealing or robbing. This was the foundation of being a person.\n\nTang Zheng was a child from a poor family, a genius who showed an extraordinary learning ability from a young age. He ranked first in the city in the high school entrance examination and was admitted to Pengcheng International School with all tuition fees waived.\n\nTang Zheng lived up to expectations, maintaining his position as the city's number one for over two years, becoming a living advertisement for Pengcheng International School. www.\n\nHowever, shortly after the start of the senior year, he was attacked on his way home from school and suffered a head injury. Since then, he had a persistent problem: whenever he tried to think, he would get a headache, and his memory was extremely poor. Knowledge points that were once easy to remember were completely forgotten and couldn't be recalled.\n\nThis condition continued until now. Even in the second semester of his senior year, there was no improvement. Every mock exam placed him at the bottom of the grade.\n\nFalling from heaven to hell caused those who were once close to him to distance themselves, and those who were jealous of him to gloat.\n\nBut Tang Zheng did not give up. He tried to study repeatedly, and each time his head hurt so much he almost fainted.\n\nDuring the physical education break today, the six hundred yuan class fund mysteriously disappeared. Since he was suffering from a headache and didn't attend the P.E. session, the class monitor, Qiao Fei, immediately accused him of staying in the classroom and stealing the class fund.\n\n\"Qiao Fei, Tang Zheng has always been an honest person, how could he steal money?\" A beautiful voice, like the singing of a lark, rang out. Fang Shishi walked over.\n\nTang Zheng cast a grateful glance at her. Fang Shishi smiled, like a hundred flowers blooming, making everyone's breathing quicken.\n\nFang Shishi not only came from a prominent family but also excelled in her studies. She had always been second in the entire school, and since Tang Zheng's injury, she had become the first in the school.\n\nBut what was most striking was her beauty. She was one of the two campus beauties of Pengcheng International School and the dream lover of many students.\n\nQiao Fei liked Fang Shishi and had openly pursued her, but was rejected. However, he was not deterred and continued to covet her secretly.\n\nSeeing her defending Tang Zheng, jealousy flared. Qiao Fei said coldly, \"Is he an upright person? I don't know. How many poor people are upright? Don't you see news reports every day about poor people doing petty theft and breaking the law for money?\"\n\n\"Yes, Qiao Fei is right.\" Voices of agreement echoed from the crowd, filled with righteous indignation.\n\nThis was a private elite school. Apart from Tang Zheng, a commoner, everyone else's family had a certain financial background and possessed an innate sense of superiority.\n\nTang Zheng glared angrily, \"Qiao Fei, poor people also have dignity. I said I didn't steal, and I didn't steal.\"\n\n\"Heh, you dare to yell at me? Poor people are just poor people, with no manners. What, you dare to stare at me? Want to hit me? Hit me, go on!\" Qiao Fei stuck his head forward, saying smugly.\n\nThe others watched Tang Zheng with amusement. He had always been a well-behaved student, never causing trouble, and even seemed a bit weak in everyone's eyes.\n\nMoreover, Qiao Fei was tall and strong, at least 1.8 meters, while Tang Zheng was only 1.7 meters. The difference was significant, and they doubted he would dare to make a move.\n\nFang Shishi frowned, her delicate nose scrunched up, and advised, \"Qiao Fei, we are all classmates, please don't be like this.\"\n\n\"I'm not doing anything. Isn't Tang Zheng trying to hit me? I'm letting him hit me.\" Qiao Fei was smug. He was sure Tang Zheng wouldn't dare to act, which would make him appear mighty and heroic.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, don't mind him. I believe you didn't steal the money.\" Fang Shishi advised, but then her eyes widened in disbelief as a huge fist smashed into Qiao Fei's face.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nQiao Fei clutched his nose and cried out, blood flowing from between his fingers.\n\nHiss~\n\nThe crowd gasped, staring at Tang Zheng as if they had seen a ghost. He... he actually dared to lay a hand on someone!\n\n\"Beat him up for me, beat him hard!\" Qiao Fei roared. Several of his lackeys rushed forward and pounced on Tang Zheng.\n\nTang Zheng quickly covered his head, his body raining down with punches like raindrops on plantain leaves. Instead of crying out, he gritted his teeth, his eyes red, staring fixedly at Qiao Fei.\n\n\"Kill him, this pauper! I'll not only kill him, but I'll also kill his old, useless grandfather!\" Qiao Fei yelled in fury. Having been pampered since childhood, when had he ever suffered such hardship, especially in front of Fang Shishi? He had lost so much face; he couldn't let it go without getting his revenge.\n\nTang Zheng's eyes instantly widened. His grandfather was his only family. He would never allow anyone to harm his grandfather.\n\nRoar!\n\nLike a leopard, he broke through the encirclement and tackled Qiao Fei. Despite the difference in height, Tang Zheng's consistent long-distance running had made his physical condition much better than the pampered Qiao Fei, and he was stronger. Using both fists and feet, in a short while, Qiao Fei's face turned into a pig's head.\n\nEveryone was stunned. How did Tang Zheng suddenly become so fierce?\n\nFang Shishi's small mouth opened wide. Looking at Qiao Fei's pig's head, she felt a sense of relief. Qiao Fei often bothered her, which was a constant nuisance.\n\n\"What are you doing? Stop!\" Suddenly, a thunderous roar exploded, making everyone's heart skip a beat. They thought, 'The old witch has appeared.'\n\nThe old witch was the class teacher, Wu Cuihong. In her fifties, she was stout and had a particularly fierce personality that almost everyone feared.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, what are you doing?\" Wu Cuihong's anger surged.\n\nTang Zheng stopped punching. Qiao Fei immediately got up, staring at Tang Zheng in shock and said, \"You... you dare to hit me.\"\n\n\"What exactly is going on?\" Wu Cuihong asked sternly, her angry eyes sweeping over them.\n\n\"Teacher, Tang Zheng stole the class fund and hit someone,\" several lackeys quickly added fuel to the fire.\n\n\"I didn't steal the money!\" Tang Zheng retorted with almost stubborn insistence.\n\nWu Cuihong immediately frowned deeply, looking at Tang Zheng unpleasantly. She had thought she had found a treasure before, as he was always first in the city in every exam, which brought honor to her as his class teacher. But she looked down on the pauper Tang Zheng from the bottom of her heart.\n\nAfter Tang Zheng fell from grace and became the last in the grade, her attitude towards him completely changed. She never gave him a pleasant look.\n\nBecause Tang Zheng not only couldn't bring her any benefits but had become a burden dragging her down. She had been applying to the school to transfer Tang Zheng to another class or expel him, but the school had not yet made a final decision.\n\nWu Cuihong had a sudden inspiration. This was a rare opportunity to get rid of the burden.\n\n\"Everyone else return to your seats and study. A few students, help Qiao Fei to the infirmary. Tang Zheng, come out with me,\" Wu Cuihong arranged coldly.\n\n\"Tang Zheng is in trouble now. I wonder how the old witch will deal with him,\" someone said gloatingly.\n\nWatching Tang Zheng's receding figure, Fang Shishi's expression was complex. She bit her lip and quickly followed, \"Teacher, I believe Tang Zheng didn't steal the money. There must be a misunderstanding.\"\n\nWu Cuihong stopped, looking kindly at Fang Shishi, and said, \"Shishi, money doesn't grow wings and fly away. Since so many people say Tang Zheng stole it, it must be true. You should go back to class quickly.\"\n\n\"No, there must be a misunderstanding,\" Fang Shishi insisted.\n\nWu Cuihong's expression darkened slightly, but she still said affectionately, \"Shishi, you should trust your teacher. Your teacher will handle it properly.\"\n\nFang Shishi looked at Tang Zheng and found him gritting his teeth, not saying a word, clearly feeling greatly wronged.\n\nWu Cuihong didn't want to say more and led Tang Zheng downstairs.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, not only are your grades poor, dragging the class down, but now you're stealing and hitting people. What do you think you're doing? Is this what a student should do?\" Wu Cuihong criticized him ferociously under the teaching building.\n\n\"Teacher, I didn't steal the money. Qiao Fei slandered me, which is why I acted.\"\n\n\"Hmph, why did he slander you and not other classmates? A straight body fears no crooked shadow,\" Wu Cuihong said dismissively.\n\nTang Zheng glared at her angrily. As a teacher, she made conclusions without investigation. How much he used to respect her; he was simply blind.\n\n\"You don't need to attend class today. Go and clean the basement of the laboratory,\" Wu Cuihong said, waving her hand with a look of disgust.\n\n\"Ghost Building?\" Tang Zheng was startled.\n\nWu Cuihong raised an eyebrow and said, \"Nonsense, what ghost building? Dare to talk nonsense again, and I'll have you call your parents.\"\n\nTang Zheng swallowed, and said nothing. His grandfather was already ill. How could he come to school? Besides, he couldn't tell his grandfather about his situation at school, or he would definitely be very sad and his condition would worsen.\n\nHe dared not tell his grandfather about his declining grades, because he had always been his grandfather's pride. He couldn't bear to make his grandfather sad. He had been trying hard to overcome difficulties and return to the peak so that his grandfather could continue to be happy.\n\nThe laboratory building was called the Ghost Building by students, not without reason. A few years ago, a shocking incident occurred here: a female student died suddenly in the basement of the laboratory building. It was said that her blood was completely drained, and she turned into a mummified corpse.\n\nThe police could not find any clues. The school also invited a renowned monk to perform rituals. In the following years, no more strange incidents occurred, but the legend of the Ghost Building spread. No one was willing to come here unless it was for a science class.\n\nWu Cuihong asking him to clean the basement was clearly malicious, intended to scare him or to cause him to suffer the same fate as the female student.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm not scared easily,\" Tang Zheng wasn't lacking in courage. Wu Cuihong deliberately wanted to scare him. If he retreated, wouldn't that fulfill her wish?\n\nCreak!\n\nThe basement door was pushed open, and a damp, musty smell hit him. Tang Zheng shivered. The basement was much colder than outside...\n\n[Author's Note]: New book released, as exciting as ever. Please collect, tip, and comment!",

    "content": "In the basement, discarded experimental equipment lay covered in a thick layer of dust, sparsely connected by cobwebs.\n\nTang Zheng frowned. There was no point in cleaning this; the old hag was just trying to mess with him.\n\nTo avoid giving her more reasons to criticize him, he picked up a broom and started sweeping. An hour later, he was slightly sweaty, and the basement looked brand new.\n\n\"The haunted house is nothing more than this. It seems it's just for scaring the timid,\" Tang Zheng scoffed, no longer feeling any fear.\n\n\"Kid, you're finally here!\" a small voice suddenly boomed, startling him.\n\n\"Who's there?\" His body hairs stood on end as he looked around. There wasn't a soul in sight. \"I must be too tense and hallucinating.\"\n\n\"Kid, I've waited so long for you.\" The voice spoke again.\n\nTang Zheng's face turned ashen. This was definitely not a hallucination; the voice was real.\n\n\"You... who exactly are you? Don't hide, or I'll find you and make you pay.\" Tang Zheng's voice trembled.\n\nScaring people to death could kill them. Though brave, he knew fear.\n\n\"Tian Chanzi, you're trying to turn the tables now? You're dreaming too big.\" Another sinister voice emerged. Just hearing it sent shivers down his spine.\n\n\"Yin Mo, what do you want?\"\n\n\"Heh, of course, I want to kill him, so you'll never have a chance to rise again.\"\n\n\"You wish!\"\n\n\"Caw caw, I absorbed the Xuan Yin power a few years ago and have completely refined it. You're no match for me now. Do you think you can stop me?\"\n\n\"Kid, run!\" the first voice shouted.\n\nTang Zheng was now certain this wasn't a prank. Were there really ghosts? He was about to bolt but found he couldn't move, as if immobilized by a spell.\n\n\"Why can't I move?\" Tang Zheng asked, his eyes wide with panic.\n\n\"Haha, of course, you can't move. I've cast a immobilization spell on you. It would be a ghost if you *could* move,\" the cold voice said triumphantly. \"Tian Chanzi, I'm about to devour his soul, cutting off your last hope. Caw caw.\"\n\n\"Yin Mo, you are too despicable!\"\n\n\"Haha, I am of the demon race. Despicability is my nature.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nTang Zheng cried out. His brain felt as if it were being pricked by needles, a thousand times worse than his usual headaches, causing him to lose consciousness instantly.\n\nTwo divine senses[1] drilled into Tang Zheng's brain, rapidly surging towards its depths. One was black, and the other was cyan. The black divine sense moved faster, quickly reaching Tang Zheng's central nervous system.\n\n\"Tian Chanzi, you failed. You will soon be scattered and vanish from this world. Caw caw,\" Yin Mo gloated with a sinister laugh.\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\nThe black divine sense entered Tang Zheng's central nervous system.\n\n\"Heaven is destroying me, Tian Chanzi,\" Tian Chanzi cried out in despair.\n\nAfter so many years, he had finally encountered a Xuan Yang physique[2]. He had thought he could use him to recover his strength and fight Yin Mo to the death. He hadn't expected Yin Mo to gain nourishment from a Xuan Yin physique a few years ago, surpassing him in power. This time, Yin Mo had gotten there first. Once Tang Zheng died, Tian Chanzi would have no chance of a comeback.\n\n\"Ah! How could this be? This kid isn't a Xuan Yang physique, he... he's actually... the Nine Yang Sacred Body!\"\n\nAn unexpected turn of events! Yin Mo roared in shock and disbelief, attempting to retreat from Tang Zheng's central nervous system but finding himself enveloped by a vast, pure Yang energy.\n\n\"Nine Yang Sacred Body!\" Tian Chanzi exclaimed involuntarily.\n\nThe Nine Yang Sacred Body only existed in legends. He never thought he'd encounter one. Like the Xuan Yang physique, the Nine Yang Sacred Body was a body of utmost purity and Yang, but the Nine Yang Sacred Body was even more refined, containing powerful pure Yang energy.\n\n\"Haha, Yin Mo, you brought this upon yourself. You're dead for sure now!\" Tian Chanzi became excited.\n\nYin Mo's cultivation technique was primarily Yin and soft. Pure Yang energy was his natural nemesis. However, he believed he could handle the Xuan Yang physique, so he entered Tang Zheng's body to kill him, preventing Tian Chanzi from absorbing this pure Yang energy.\n\nTian Chanzi's cultivation technique was of the Yang and powerful lineage. If he absorbed this pure Yang energy, his strength would greatly increase, threatening Yin Mo's safety.\n\n\"Tian Chanzi, I won't accept this! How can this kid be the Nine Yang Sacred Body?\" Yin Mo roared, his voice filled with anguish.\n\n\"Yin Mo, you great demon! This is destiny. Heaven wants to destroy you!\" Tian Chanzi declared.\n\n\"Ah! I refuse to accept this!\" The roar abruptly stopped, and everything returned to peace. Yin Mo's divine sense was completely refined by the pure Yang energy.\n\nTian Chanzi's divine sense dared not advance further. Just as he was about to withdraw from Tang Zheng's brain, he found himself firmly bound by a powerful attraction.\n\n\"What's happening? Is he going to deal with me next?\" Tian Chanzi crashed against it but found he couldn't break free.\n\n\"This... how can the Nine Yang Sacred Body have such power? It was easy to get in, but so difficult to get out.\"\n\n\"Huh? My divine sense has actually become a little stronger.\" Suddenly, Tian Chanzi noticed something strange. It seemed the pure Yang energy didn't harm him; instead, it strengthened his divine sense.\n\n...\n\nTang Zheng dazedly opened his eyes. The stinging sensation was completely gone. The scene before he fainted was still fresh in his memory.\n\n\"Ghosts, there are ghosts!\" He felt ice-cold all over. The eerie feeling made even him, an atheist, feel afraid.\n\n\"Kid, I am not a ghost. You don't need to be afraid.\" Tian Chanzi's voice spoke.\n\n\"Who... who are you? Where are you?\" Tang Zheng stammered, looking around and finding no one.\n\n\"I am in your mind.\"\n\n\"...In... in my mind?\" Tang Zheng swallowed.\n\n\"Don't worry, I won't harm you.\" Tian Chanzi said gently. *If you don't mess with me, everything will be fine. How could I possibly harm you?* he thought.\n\n*If you're not going to harm me, why are you in my head? Do you think I'm stupid?* Tang Zheng grumbled internally.\n\n\"You don't believe me?\"\n\n\"No, I believe you.\" Tang Zheng hadn't figured out the situation yet and decided to stabilize the other party first. Wasn't there that Yin Mo earlier? Why was there only Tian Chanzi now?\n\n\"Yin Mo is already dead by your hand,\" Tian Chanzi revealed his thoughts with a single sentence.\n\n\"Dead by my hand?\" Tang Zheng was dumbfounded. Wait, no. How did he know what I was thinking?\n\n\"I am in your mind. Whatever you think, I know. From now on, you don't need to speak to communicate with me; we can communicate directly through divine sense,\" Tian Chanzi explained.\n\n\"Then get out of my head quickly.\" Tang Zheng did not like this feeling of being completely exposed to someone else.\n\n\"I can't get out.\" Tian Chanzi said with a wry smile. \"My divine sense is weak now and is bound by your Nine Yang Sacred Body. Unless I recover my strength, or you become strong enough to control the pure Yang energy of your Nine Yang body and let me out, I can only stay in your head.\"\n\nTo be honest, he didn't want to come out for now. His divine sense was fragile and could easily dissipate, while Tang Zheng's pure Yang energy could nourish it.\n\nTang Zheng's face turned as sour as a bitter melon. What kind of situation was this?\n\n\"I am a cultivator from a thousand years ago with the ability to move mountains and fill seas. Don't worry, I will not mistreat you while temporarily residing in your brain. I will teach you the methods of cultivation, giving you the power to reach the heavens and penetrate the earth.\"\n\n\"Methods of cultivation?\" Tang Zheng's heart stirred. He had always thought this was just a legend, but he never expected it to be real.\n\nSince the other party couldn't get out for now, he had no choice but to accept. His heart couldn't help but pound with anticipation for his cultivation methods.\n\n\"Of course, I will make you a strong person, a true powerhouse.\" Tian Chanzi vowed. Tang Zheng was a Nine Yang Sacred Body. If he took him as a disciple, his future achievements would be immeasurable, giving him a chance to return to his sect.\n\nIt turned out he was an expelled disciple from his sect, and his greatest wish in life was to return. Having a disciple with the Nine Yang Sacred Body would be his greatest asset for returning to his sect.\n\n\"Now, first help me retrieve something, and then I will teach you the cultivation techniques.\"\n\nFollowing instructions, Tang Zheng smashed a floor tile at the corner of the wall, revealing a ancient sheepskin scroll embedded in the stone. Four characters were inscribed on it: \"Tongtian Ancient Scroll\"[3].\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\"A good thing. Take it first, and I'll tell you later. I'll refine the blood clots in your brain first, then teach you the cultivation techniques.\" Tian Chanzi had just investigated and found that many of the meridians in his brain were blocked by blood clots, which needed to be cleared before he could cultivate.\n\n\"Blood clots?\"\n\n\"Yes. Was your brain injured before?\"\n\nTang Zheng immediately remembered the injury he sustained half a year ago. Could this be the reason for his headaches?\n\n\"Don't worry, this is a minor issue. I will heal you, but my strength will be significantly depleted, so I will go into hibernation for a while. Don't panic too much; I will wake up soon.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" Tang Zheng felt a surge of gratitude. After his injury was healed, he could return to his peak state. He wanted to show those who looked down on him.\n\nA warm feeling enveloped his brain, and he felt an unprecedented peace.\n\nA moment later, the feeling disappeared. He felt his mind was incredibly clear, without any haziness.\n\n\"Am I... better?\" He carefully recalled the knowledge he had learned before. Knowledge surged in like a tide, and his headache was gone.\n\n\"It's done, it's really done!\" He danced with excitement. \"Tian Chanzi, I'm really all better.\"\n\nBut no one answered him. He then remembered that Tian Chanzi had depleted his energy and was in hibernation.\n\n\"Tongtian Ancient Scroll, what exactly is this thing that makes him so concerned?\" Tang Zheng's gaze fell upon the sheepskin scroll. The four ancient characters seemed to possess a magical power that drew him in.\n\nHe gently unrolled the sheepskin scroll. An ancient, rustic text appeared before his eyes, and he couldn't help but read it aloud...\n\n---\n[1] 神識 (Shénshí): Divine sense, a mystical perception or awareness in some cultivation novels.\n[2] 玄陽之體 (Xuán Yáng Zhī Tǐ): Xuan Yang Physique, a body type with profound Yang energy.\n[3] 通天古卷 (Tōng Tiān Gǔ Juàn): Tongtian Ancient Scroll, literally \"Heaven-Connecting Ancient Scroll.\"",

    "content": "The \"Heavenly Scroll\" was obscure and profound; Tang Zheng spent half an hour just to get through its thousand-plus characters.\n\nJust as he was about to set the scroll aside, he suddenly felt a tiny stream of energy slowly flowing through his meridians, warm and comfortable, giving him an unprecedented, subtle sensation.\n\n\"Huh? How did I wake up so quickly?\" Tianchanzi's voice rang out again, sounding surprised.\n\n\"You're awake!\" Tang Zheng had thought he would be dormant for a long time and didn't expect him to revive so soon.\n\n\"Hiss! How can you have true qi in your body? What did you just do?\" Tianchanzi shrieked in horror, as if he had seen a ghost.\n\n\"True qi? That stream of energy is true qi?\" Tang Zheng was surprised. \"I didn't do anything, I just read through this Heavenly Scroll.\"\n\n\"You cultivated the Heavenly Scroll? ...How is this possible? Yin Demon and I studied the Heavenly Scroll for over a thousand years without any success. This scroll is completely incomprehensible; how can you cultivate it immediately?\" Tianchanzi was on the verge of spitting blood.\n\n\"I only read it once,\" Tang Zheng explained.\n\n\"Read... How did you read it?\"\n\nTang Zheng rolled his eyes. How else could one read a book but by reading it word for word, sentence by sentence?\n\n\"Read it to me,\" Tianchanzi said impatiently.\n\nHelpless, Tang Zheng could only read it word by word, sentence by sentence. ▲↖, w⊙ww.\n\n\"Stop!\" Tianchanzi suddenly shouted. \"Why are you reading it like that?\"\n\n\"Isn't this how it's read?\" Tang Zheng was baffled. He had lived for so many years; was he unable to even read a book as instructed?\n\n\"Shouldn't it be read vertically from right to left? Why are you reading it horizontally from left to right?\"\n\n\"Don't all books read horizontally from left to right?\"\n\nThis was common sense for modern people.\n\nTianchanzi was silent for a moment, then sighed and said, \"So that's how it is. No wonder Yin Demon and I studied for so many years without any results. We were going down the completely wrong path.\"\n\nAncient people read books vertically from right to left. Tianchanzi and Yin Demon had never considered any other way of reading, which was why they could never uncover the secret of the Heavenly Scroll.\n\n\"Is this all heaven's will? The Heavenly Scroll belongs to this kid,\" Tianchanzi mused with great emotion.\n\nA thousand years ago, Tianchanzi and Yin Demon coincidentally discovered this mysterious scroll. They fought fiercely, each wanting to possess it, and in the end, both were severely injured, their physical bodies destroyed. Their divine consciousness was actually absorbed into the Heavenly Scroll.\n\nThe two continued to fight within the scroll but could not overcome each other. They also silently studied the secrets of the Heavenly Scroll but achieved nothing.\n\nThe Heavenly Scroll was completely incomprehensible, not at all like the powerful cultivation technique it was rumored to be.\n\nAfter a thousand years, with the ebb and flow of tides and tectonic shifts, the Heavenly Scroll was buried underground, eventually merging into a piece of rock. This rock was later used to build this laboratory building. The two were trapped within the Heavenly Scroll, their divine consciousness confined to the basement.\n\nThey hoped to find a suitable living person to possess and be reborn, but they had strict requirements for a host. If the host's physique was too weak, they couldn't withstand their divine consciousness and would end up dying.\n\nA few years prior, a female student with a profound Yin physique¹ had set foot in this place, giving Yin Demon hope. He eagerly entered her brain to possess her, but ultimately failed, resulting in the absorption of all the female student's vital blood.\n\nAlthough Yin Demon did not succeed in possessing her, he absorbed the female student's profound Yin energy, greatly increasing his strength and gradually gaining the upper hand over Tianchanzi.\n\nAs the struggle continued for several years, Tianchanzi was about to be utterly defeated and his spirit scattered. It was at this moment that Tang Zheng appeared, leading to this series of events.\n\nAfter hearing the twisted cause and effect, Tang Zheng marveled in secret and felt fortunate. He owed his ability to remain intact, unlike that female student who became a dried husk, to his Nine Yang Sacred Body² physique.\n\n\"Tianchanzi, what is the profound mystery of this Nine Yang Sacred Body?\"\n\n\"I don't know the specific mysteries, but legend has it that the Nine Yang Sacred Body is one of the rarest physiques in the world, with infinite mysteries. A sage in ancient times possessed the Nine Yang Sacred Body, and his strength was earth-shattering.\"\n\n\"So powerful!\" Tang Zheng's heart surged with excitement. Did this mean he too would have earth-shattering abilities in the future?\n\n\"But it also depends on opportunity. Not everyone is that powerful,\" Tianchanzi poured a bucket of cold water on him.\n\nTang Zheng snorted in dissatisfaction. \"You're just jealous of me.\"\n\n\"...\" Tianchanzi was speechless. He was indeed jealous. Tang Zheng had somehow succeeded in cultivating the Heavenly Scroll; if this wasn't something to be jealous of, then what was?\n\n\"Kid, don't celebrate too early. The Nine Yang Sacred Body is a rare physique, but extreme things can backfire. The Nine Yang Sacred Body possesses the purest Yang energy, but a person's body cannot withstand such strong pure Yang energy. All things in heaven and earth require the harmony of Yin and Yang to be everlasting. The stronger the pure Yang energy, the more it needs the balance of profound Yin energy, understand?\" Tianchanzi warned.\n\nTang Zheng's enthusiasm was instantly dampened. \"What happens if there's no profound Yin energy to balance it?\"\n\n\"Your Yang energy will surge to the heavens, and you'll explode and die. Moreover, the stronger your cultivation becomes, the stronger your pure Yang energy will be, and the closer you'll be to your death. Kid, you're actually quite lucky. If you hadn't met me, you definitely wouldn't have lived past twenty years old, because without the balance of profound Yin energy, you were destined to die before twenty.\"\n\nTang Zheng felt as if he had fallen from heaven to hell. Fortunately, his mental fortitude was strong, and he quickly asked, \"Twenty years old? I'm eighteen this year, so I only have two years left to live? Right, didn't you say if there's profound Yin energy to achieve Yin-Yang balance, there's no problem? Where can I find profound Yin energy?\"\n\nTianchanzi chuckled sinisterly. \"Heh heh, heaven and earth give birth to all things, and they also overcome each other. Since there is pure Yang energy, there is naturally pure Yin energy. Profound Yin energy is mostly found in many inaccessible cold and desolate places. With your current strength, going to those places would be suicidal.\"\n\nTang Zheng's heart turned to ash. It was as good as saying nothing.\n\n\"Kid, don't rush. I haven't finished speaking yet. Another kind of profound Yin energy is within reach.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" Tang Zheng was overjoyed, as if he had grasped a lifeline.\n\n\"Women!\" Tianchanzi said mysteriously.\n\n\"Women?\" Tang Zheng was confused.\n\n\"Yes, men possess pure Yang energy, while women possess pure Yin energy. As long as you absorb the profound Yin energy from women, you can naturally achieve Yin-Yang balance, and then your little life will be temporarily saved.\"\n\n\"Then how do I absorb a woman's profound Yin energy?\"\n\n\"The fastest shortcut is to get into bed.\"\n\nTang Zheng's face flushed. For an eighteen-year-old youth, such a thing was too shameful, although he did occasionally fantasize about it.\n\n\"Tianchanzi, you are too shameless.\"\n\nTianchanzi said furiously, \"Kid, I'm teaching you how to save your life, and you're talking about me, an old man like this.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, I won't talk about you. But this method of yours is completely unfeasible. I can't just pull a random woman off the street and get into bed with her, can I?\" Tang Zheng said with a wry smile.\n\n\"Of course not. Although women possess profound Yin energy, not every woman's profound Yin energy is suitable for you. You must have strong profound Yin energy to achieve the effect of Yin-Yang balance. Let me give you some common knowledge. What people usually call 'masculinity' is the natural aura and scent that pure Yang energy emits. And why do women have a pleasant scent? That's a manifestation of profound Yin energy. The stronger the profound Yin energy, the more obvious the body fragrance will be. The commonly spoken 'virgin's fragrance' is the scent emitted by profound Yin energy accumulated over decades.\"\n\nTang Zheng heard this theory for the first time and was very curious. \"So I need to pursue women who have body fragrance, and then sleep with them?\"\n\n\"That's the idea. However, because you have the Nine Yang Sacred Body, one woman cannot achieve Yin-Yang balance.\"\n\nTang Zheng's face immediately turned into a bitter gourd. Are you playing with me? Do I have to pursue many women?\n\n\"Kid, don't overthink it for now. Since you are so compatible with the Heavenly Scroll, I can't teach you my cultivation technique anymore. The Heavenly Scroll is a very powerful and mysterious cultivation technique. Cultivating it is far more potent for you than cultivating mine,\" Tianchanzi said, feeling greatly disheartened. His hope of returning to his sect was dashed.\n\nTang Zheng calmed his mood slightly. \"Since you already know the cultivation method of the Heavenly Scroll, you can also cultivate it.\"\n\n\"I can't anymore. I tried just now. It turns out that the Heavenly Scroll can only be cultivated by those with no foundation. I already have a cultivation base, so I can't cultivate it. Alas, I fought Yin Demon to the death for the Heavenly Scroll back then, never expecting that the Heavenly Scroll was not suitable for us at all. In the end, it benefited you, this kid.\"\n\n\"However, the Heavenly Scroll is a mind technique, it's the foundation. You still need to learn other things from me. Don't worry, I'll teach you everything I know. Because the stronger you become, the faster I will recover.\"\n\nThe deeper Tang Zheng's cultivation became, the more his divine consciousness would be nourished, and the faster Tianchanzi would recover. Once he reached a certain level, he could leave Tang Zheng's mind and find a suitable host to be reborn.\n\n\"Don't worry, I will definitely study hard.\" Tang Zheng, having experienced this unforeseen event, deeply understood the importance of strength.\n\nHe had to become stronger!\n\nAlthough becoming stronger meant stronger pure Yang energy and a greater risk of self-detonation, this still couldn't suppress his determination to become stronger.\n\n\"Now, I'll first explain some cultivation-related knowledge to you. Cultivation is about seizing the creation of heaven and earth, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into one's body, and then, with the cultivation technique, transforming it into one's own true qi. The stronger the true qi, the higher the cultivation.\"\n\n\"As the saying goes, the eight meridians, there are a total of eight main meridians in the human body. Each meridian can store true qi. The cultivation levels are correspondingly divided into many realms such as Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, Soul Transformation, and Mahayana. Each realm is further divided into nine grades. You have now entered Qi Refining Grade One, with one inch of true qi in each of the eight main meridians. When your true qi reaches two inches, you will enter Qi Refining Grade Two... No, how can this be?\"\n\nSuddenly, Tianchanzi exclaimed.\n\n\"What's with your exclamations again?\"\n\n\"How do you have an extra main meridian? You have nine main meridians now?\" Tianchanzi sounded as if he had seen a ghost.\n\nThere were countless meridians in the human body, but only the main meridians could truly store true qi. However, at this moment, Tang Zheng had nine main meridians storing true qi within his body.\n\nTang Zheng was mystified. With a thought, he realized there were indeed nine meridians storing true qi.\n\n\"Could this be the mystery of the Nine Yang Sacred Body?\" Tianchanzi muttered to himself. \"Alas, I don't understand either. Since it's come to this, there's nothing I can do.\"\n\n\"Is this a good thing or a bad thing?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" Tianchanzi said impatiently.\n\nTang Zheng felt rebuffed and didn't press the issue further. He asked again, \"Then do I have spells now?\"\n\n\"Hmph, spells aren't that easy to learn. You must reach Qi Refining Grade Three before you can cultivate spells.\"\n\n\"Then what can I do now?\" Tang Zheng was slightly disappointed. He had thought he would immediately possess legendary spells, only to find it was all an illusion.\n\n\"Of course, there are things you can do. You can cultivate martial arts.\"\n\n\"Martial arts?\"\n\n\"Yes, the world is not only comprised of cultivators, but also martial artists. They are no weaker than cultivators. Martial artists who cultivate to their peak can also glimpse the Great Dao, possessing a similar outcome through different paths.\"\n\n\"Are martial artists really that powerful? Why do those on TV just show fancy moves?\" Tang Zheng was skeptical. This was already a technological era; martial arts had declined and didn't seem as powerful as Tianchanzi claimed.\n\n\"What do you know? How could truly skilled masters be seen by ordinary people? You just need to remember that there are talented people emerging in the world, and you must quickly improve your strength. Now, I will teach you the introductory martial skill, Heavenly Net Hand.\"\n\nAs soon as the words fell, Tang Zheng found an image in his mind, depicting a complete set of movements.\n\n\"This is the Heavenly Net Hand. Although it's an introductory martial art, its power is immense when cultivated to its extreme. Heavenly Net Hand, as the name suggests, is like a net cast from heaven, leaving the opponent with nowhere to escape.\"\n\nTang Zheng was like a man with insatiable hunger; martial arts were like peerless beauties, so he had no reason to refuse. Moreover, since Tianchanzi described it so powerfully, it must be true.\n\n\"Does it look like this when I use it?\" Tang Zheng's figure flashed, and he moved according to the movements in the image.\n\nWhoosh~\n\nA gust of strong wind swept past. He moved like a ghost, shifting and flashing within the basement.\n\nTianchanzi was almost stunned. This kid's learning ability was too formidable! He had only seen it once and already possessed such a deep level of proficiency. Was he going to let anyone else live?\n\n\"Am I practicing correctly?\" Tang Zheng stopped and asked.\n\nTianchanzi was so shocked he was speechless. After recovering from his stupor, he said weakly, \"...No problem.\"\n\nTang Zheng's face lit up with joy. This sense of power was even more intense than the sense of accomplishment from learning.\n\n\"Alright, that's all for today. You need to diligently cultivate the Heavenly Scroll,\" Tianchanzi said and then fell silent... He was truly disheartened by Tang Zheng's inhuman learning speed.\n\nTang Zheng walked out of the laboratory building. The residual rays of the setting sun shone on him, casting a long shadow. School was already over.\n\nPengcheng International School did not provide accommodation because the students were basically from affluent families, and no one was willing to live in the dormitories.\n\nTang Zheng left the school and ran home. His home was located in the north of Changheng City, which was the old city district with numerous urban villages, known as the poor district.\n\nCompared to the city center, the northern part of the city was like the difference between hell and heaven. Tang Zheng was already accustomed to this. He ran ten kilometers back to his doorstep, feeling refreshed instead of out of breath like usual.\n\n\"This is the mystery of entering the Qi Refining stage.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, calmed his mind, and pushed open the dilapidated door. It was a small, detached bungalow, only about forty square meters, with a low ceiling and dim lighting.\n\n\"Grandpa, I'm back.\" He called out, but no one responded. The house was empty.\n\nTang Zheng frowned. Grandpa must have gone out to work again with his sick body. His heart felt a sting, and he turned to run out again.\n\nThe garbage dump, with its stench, was a place ordinary people would shun, but for those who made a living there, it was a treasure mountain, a gift from heaven.\n\nTang Zheng was already accustomed to the environment of the garbage dump because his grandfather had raised him with painstaking effort by picking through garbage.\n\n\"Damn it, you old bastard, this is Brother Hu's territory! How dare you rummage for food on Brother Hu's turf? Are you looking for death?!\" A furious roar reached Tang Zheng's ears.\n\n---\n¹ Profound Yin physique (玄阴之体): A rare physique characterized by an abundance of Yin energy.\n\n² Nine Yang Sacred Body (九阳圣体): A rare and powerful physique associated with extreme Yang energy.",

    "content": "\"I've always been picking up scraps here, since when did this become your territory?\" an aged voice retorted indignantly.\n\n\"Damn it, still talking back? Looking for a beating, huh!\" With a muffled thud, the sound of someone falling to the ground echoed.\n\nTang Zheng's heart tightened, and his anger flared. The aged voice was all too familiar; it was his grandfather, Tang Dahai.\n\nIn a few quick steps, he arrived at the scene and saw his grandfather lying on the ground, pinned under the foot of a burly man.\n\n\"Let go of my grandpa,\" Tang Zheng roared.\n\n\"What brat is this? Scram!\" The big man glanced dismissively at Tang Zheng, not taking him seriously at all.\n\n\"Xiao Zheng, why are you here? Go quickly,\" the old man gasped, calling out weakly.\n\n\"Grandpa, I'm here to help you.\" Tang Zheng's toes pushed off the ground, and he swiftly appeared before the big man.\n\nThe big man was slightly taken aback by Tang Zheng's speed. Seeing a mere student dare to challenge his authority, he was furious and bellowed, \"Kid, you want a beating, I'll oblige you.\"\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\nA punch was thrown, but it missed. Before the big man could react, he was hit in the stomach, a blow that felt like his insides were being churned, causing excruciating pain.\n\n\"You...\" The big man was about to curse, but he saw a massive fist hurtling towards his face. He cried out in pain, blood gushing from his nose, and he fell backward.\n\nTang Zheng rushed to help the old man, asking with concern, \"Grandpa, are you alright?\"\n\nThe old man panted, saying weakly, \"I'm fine, Xiao Zheng, you leave quickly. This person is fierce and not to be trifled with.\"\n\n\"Grandpa, as long as I'm here, no one can bully you,\" Tang Zheng stated resolutely.\n\n\"Sigh, you should focus on your studies. Don't fight over an old man like me. If the teacher finds out, you'll surely be criticized,\" the old man said anxiously.\n\nTang Zheng's heart ached. His grandfather always put him first, which made him even angrier at the big man.\n\n\"Grandpa, you rest for a bit. I'll deal with this person first.\" Tang Zheng turned and glared coldly at the big man.\n\nThe big man had already gotten up and was furious. \"Brat, you're asking for death. Since that's the case, I'll let you know my power.\"\n\n*Swish!*\n\nThe big man drew a gleaming dagger, his menacing intent revealed.\n\nThe old man was startled and quickly shouted, \"Xiao Zheng, you leave quickly. I'll stop him.\"\n\n\"Grandpa, he can't hurt me,\" Tang Zheng reassured him, then fixed his gaze on the big man. \"Why did you hurt my grandpa?\"\n\n\"Damn it, this is Brother Hu's territory. You must get Brother Hu's permission to make a living here. How dare you challenge Brother Hu's authority? Not killing you is already showing mercy,\" the big man roared aggressively.\n\n\"Brother Hu?\" Tang Zheng, being a well-behaved student, had never heard of Brother Hu.\n\nThe big man, named Dongzi, was a henchman of Brother Hu, assigned to guard the territory. People who scavenged in this area had to hand over anything good they found to him.\n\nBrother Hu was a notorious figure in the north of the city, whose real name was Lin Hu. He had gathered a group of henchmen and was a well-known figure in the underworld of Changheng City.\n\nHe originally disdained the garbage dump as a territory, but a few days ago, someone dug up an antique from the dump and sold it for millions.\n\nThis made Lin Hu pay attention to the area, and he sent a subordinate to specifically watch over it. Scavengers had to submit anything they found for appraisal, and anything valuable would be seized.\n\nTang Zheng's grandfather had been ill for some time and was unaware of this new rule. Today, he had come to scavenge while sick, which led to this conflict.\n\n\"What, scared? Let me tell you, it's too late,\" Dongzi said smugly, thinking his threat of Brother Hu had intimidated Tang Zheng.\n\n\"I don't care if it's Brother Hu or Brother Niu. If you dare to hurt my grandpa, I won't let any of you off easily.\" Tang Zheng was already a cultivator; how could he be afraid of a few thugs?\n\nDongzi was surprised. This kid had a death wish, daring to not be intimidated by Brother Hu's name.\n\n\"Hmph, kid, you dare to say that? You're dead. Go to hell!\" Dongzi charged forward, the dagger aimed directly at Tang Zheng's chest.\n\nTang Zheng dodged to the side, grabbed the opponent's wrist, and with a *crack*, bones snapped. The big man cried out, and large beads of sweat broke out on his forehead.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nTang Zheng kicked Dongzi's knee. His knees buckled, and Dongzi knelt directly on the ground.\n\n\"If you dare to come here again, I'll break both your legs too,\" Tang Zheng said sternly. \"Scram!\"\n\nDongzi, filled with rage but unable to speak, said, \"Kid, do you know the consequences of offending Brother Hu?\"\n\n\"Damn it, still blabbering!\" Tang Zheng snorted coldly. With a *crack*, Dongzi's other arm twisted like a rope.\n\n\"Ah, it hurts so much! Let go of me, I won't dare again,\" Dongzi, clearly not expecting Tang Zheng to be so decisive, begged with a heartbroken cry.\n\nThe old man stared at Tang Zheng as if he were a stranger, hastily urging, \"Xiao Zheng, let him go quickly, you'll kill him.\"\n\nTang Zheng released his grip, and Dongzi fled like a stray dog, no longer daring to utter a single boastful word.\n\n\"Oh no, this is a huge mess. We should avoid people like them, not provoke them,\" the old man lamented with a grimace.\n\n\"Grandpa, if they dare to come once, I'll fight them once,\" Tang Zheng consoled.\n\n\"Xiao Zheng, they are numerous and not good people. How can you be their match? Besides, you're a student, how can you fight?\"\n\n\"Grandpa, I know martial arts, they are no match for me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, what martial arts do you know?\" The old man said with a stern face, \"The most important thing for a person is self-awareness, don't be arrogant.\"\n\nTang Zheng was helpless. In his grandfather's eyes, he would always be a good student, and fighting was something he absolutely could not do.\n\n\"Sigh, never mind. At worst, if they come next time, you hide, and I, this old man, will let them beat me up. They'll be fine once they're appeased,\" the old man muttered to himself.\n\nTang Zheng's nose stung, and he clenched his fists, secretly vowing that if they dared to come, he would break their dog legs.\n\nThe grandfather and grandson returned home, and Tang Zheng began to cook. The two had relied on each other for years, and he had developed excellent cooking skills, able to create unique delicacies from simple ingredients.\n\n\"Xiao Zheng, you're growing, you need to eat more meat,\" the old man placed the shredded pork from his plate into Tang Zheng's bowl, reminding him.\n\n\"I'm eating, Grandpa. You should eat too, you've lost weight recently.\"\n\n\"Heh, this old body of mine is already content to be alive, especially with you, Xiao Zheng, by my side. Heaven has truly been good to me,\" the old man's face radiated a happy and contented smile.\n\nThey were not related by blood. Tang Zheng was found by the old man in a pile of garbage; he was an abandoned child.\n\nThe old man, kind-hearted, adopted him and named him Tang Zheng. For over ten years, they had lived together, and he had provided Tang Zheng with whatever he needed to the best of his ability. Fortunately, Tang Zheng was smart and clever, with excellent academic performance, which was the old man's greatest comfort.\n\n\"Xiao Zheng, if Grandpa is no longer here, you must take good care of yourself, understand?\" the old man sighed and exhorted earnestly.\n\nTang Zheng was startled, his chopsticks falling under the table. He stared intently at his grandfather. \"Grandpa, don't think like that. You'll be fine. We'll go to the hospital tomorrow and get your illness treated.\"\n\nThe old man grinned, revealing deep wrinkles. \"I'm not thinking like that. My body is fine, it's just old ailments. I just went to the hospital a few days ago, and the doctor said I'll be fine with some rest.\"\n\nTang Zheng knew his grandfather had always been in poor health. It was said that his internal organs were damaged when he was young, leaving a lingering illness, but the doctors couldn't pinpoint the exact condition.\n\nA while ago, his old illness had flared up again, and he had gone to the hospital. The doctor prescribed medication, and he seemed a bit better these past few days.\n\n\"Xiao Zheng, you're almost eighteen soon, you'll be an adult then. Grandpa knows you've been sensible since childhood. Grandpa couldn't give you much, and from now on, you'll have to walk your own path.\"\n\nA bad premonition arose in Tang Zheng's heart. His grandfather's words sounded like a final testament; his illness was definitely not as simple as he imagined.\n\nJust as Tang Zheng was about to ask for details, a voice sounded from outside: \"Is Tang Zheng living here?\"\n\n\"Old witch!\" Tang Zheng immediately recognized the voice.\n\n\"Xiao Zheng, someone's looking for you,\" the old man said.\n\n\"Grandpa, you eat first. I'll be right out.\"\n\n\"Is it your friend?\"\n\n\"It's our class teacher.\"\n\n\"Oh, a teacher. Then I must go and meet her. Xiao Zheng, your academic achievements at school are thanks to the teacher's guidance and help. Grandpa has never had the chance to thank the teacher in person,\" the old man perked up, excitedly walking out quickly.\n\nTang Zheng wanted to stop him, but it was too late. He muttered to himself, \"Why is the old witch coming here?\"\n\nHe had been in high school for almost three years, and the old witch had never visited his home. However, he had heard that she often visited Qiao Fei and Fang Shishi's homes.\n\n\"Teacher, hello, please come in,\" the old man, hunched over, kindly invited.\n\nWu Cuihong frowned, looking at the wrinkled, white-haired, and poorly dressed old man, and said coldly, \"You are Tang Zheng's grandfather?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. Thank you, teacher, for taking care of Xiao Zheng at school and waiving his tuition fees. This is a tremendous blessing for our family,\" the old man said, filled with gratitude.\n\nTang Zheng came out and saw his grandfather being solicitous while Wu Cuihong was arrogant. He felt a surge of resentment and asked, \"Teacher Wu, may I ask what you need?\"\n\n\"Tang Zheng, I'm here to inform you of a few things.\"\n\n\"Teacher, let's talk inside,\" the old man continued to invite.\n\nWu Cuihong glanced at the low-lying house, curled her lips, and could not hide her contempt. \"I'll say it right here. Tang Zheng, you don't need to go to Class One tomorrow. From now on, you will attend Class Seven.\"\n\n\"What?\" Tang Zheng was greatly shocked. Class One was the best class for top students in the school, while Class Seven was the bottom-ranking \"trash class,\" known as the hell class, filled with prodigal sons who only knew how to eat, drink, and have fun. The two classes were worlds apart.\n\nAlthough the old man didn't understand the details, he could tell something from Wu Cuihong's tone and Tang Zheng's reaction. His face stiffened, and he asked with a trembling voice, \"Teacher, did Xiao Zheng make a mistake?\"",

    "content": "Wu Cuihong let out a cold snort and said, \"Tang Zheng doesn't study diligently. His academic performance has declined severely in the past six months, and he has ranked last in the entire grade in several exams.\"\n\n\"What, last in the entire grade?\" The old man was startled and stared with disbelief.\n\nTang Zheng felt a pang in his heart. The matter he had been hiding was finally exposed. Why was that old witch so cruel? This was no different from stabbing his grandfather in the heart.\n\nWu Cuihong completely ignored the feelings of the grandfather and grandson and continued, \"Not only is his academic performance poor, but his character is also problematic. Today, he actually stole the class fund. The school has already been extremely lenient by not expelling him.\"\n\n\"...Stole the class fund?\" The old man stared blankly at Wu Cuihong, as if listening to a heavenly book.\n\n\"Yes!\" Wu Cuihong's reply was firm, as if she had seen it with her own eyes.\n\nTang Zheng was so angry he felt like his lungs would explode. This was slander! How could she still have the demeanor of a teacher?\n\n\"I didn't steal it!\" Tang Zheng retorted loudly.\n\nWu Cuihong glanced at him teasingly and said, \"Of course you wouldn't admit it, but if not you, then who? Hmph, you don't need to argue anymore. Look at how poor your family is, classmate Qiao Fei has already promised to cover this class fund himself, making up for the class's losses. Look at the gap between you and Qiao Fei. However, it will be a great fortune for our class to be rid of a burden like you who drags everyone down...\"\n\n\"Shut up!\"\n\n\"Shut up!\"\n\nSuddenly, two shouts echoed in unison. Both the grandfather and grandson's faces turned red. Especially the old man, who was trembling with anger, his eyes bulging. He said, \"You are slandering us! My little Zheng wouldn't steal money. We are poor, but even poor people have integrity.\"\n\nWu Cuihong was startled by this display and said disdainfully, \"Quibbling!\"\n\nTang Zheng clenched his fists, making cracking sounds, and glared fiercely at Wu Cuihong, \"I said I didn't steal, and I didn't steal!\"\n\n\"You leave, we don't welcome you here!\" The old man stepped forward and suddenly roared.\n\nWu Cuihong instinctively took a step back, almost falling to the ground. In her embarrassment, she said angrily, \"As expected, you are a rude barbarian. Hmph, do you think I want to stay here? It's dirty and chaotic. I wouldn't come back even if I were invited in a palanquin.\"\n\n\"Old witch, remember what you've done today. One day, I will make you regret it,\" Tang Zheng said through gritted teeth.\n\n\"Haha, make me regret it? Do you have the ability?\" Wu Cuihong taunted, but seeing the unpleasant expressions of the grandfather and grandson, she quickly hurried away.\n\nThe old man's demeanor changed, like a deflated ball. He became listless and looked at Tang Zheng silently.\n\nTang Zheng felt an inexplicable panic and quickly explained, \"Grandpa, I really didn't steal the class fund.\"\n\n\"I know. Don't I know what kind of person my grandson is?\" The old man forced a smile and said faintly.\n\nTang Zheng breathed a sigh of relief, feeling warm. In this world, even if everyone else disbelieved him, his grandfather would always stand by his side.\n\n\"But why did you lie to me?\" Suddenly, the old man's face darkened. \"Why has your academic performance declined so severely?\"\n\n\"Grandpa, I didn't want you to worry. I had poor memory some time ago, but it's better now. Just watch, I will definitely get the first place in the city in the college entrance examination,\" Tang Zheng said confidently and assuredly.\n\nThe old man stared at him intently, and after a long pause, he nodded. \"I believe you.\" He didn't ask for details because he knew his grandson wouldn't boast.\n\n\"Little Zheng, although you are no longer in Class One, gold shines wherever it is. Don't be discouraged,\" the old man patted his shoulder and comforted him.\n\nTang Zheng nodded heavily. He had already made plans. There were still three months until the college entrance examination, and he didn't intend to burst forth and regain his former glory immediately. If he recovered his top rank in this monthly exam, he would surely be transferred back to Class One, and he didn't want to face that old witch every day.\n\n\"Actually, Class Seven is also a good choice. I can lie low and then deliver a beautiful comeback at the college entrance examination, slapping that old witch hard.\"\n\nThe moon was bright, and the night was silent.\n\nTang Zheng sat cross-legged on the wooden bed, circulating the cultivation technique of the \"Heavenly Passage Ancient Scroll.\" Warm true qi flowed through his meridians.\n\n*Hoo~*\n\nHe exhaled, feeling completely relaxed and energetic. The true qi in his nine main meridians had increased by another two points. When it increased by ten points, it would be two inches of true qi.\n\n\"Kid, your Nine Yang Sacred Body and this Heavenly Passage Ancient Scroll are a perfect match. This day of cultivation is equivalent to one month of cultivation for others,\" Tian Chanzi's voice echoed in Tang Zheng's mind.\n\nTang Zheng was secretly delighted. Cultivating faster meant he could become stronger sooner.\n\n\"But I have some bad news for you,\" Tian Chanzi changed the subject and said directly.\n\n\"What news?\"\n\n\"Your grandfather's vitality is almost depleted. He doesn't have much time left.\"\n\n\"What did you say!\" Tang Zheng was greatly shocked, as if struck by lightning. The ominous premonition in his heart was confirmed, leaving his mind blank.\n\n\"Aging, illness, and death are natural laws. You don't need to be sad.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! He is my grandfather, not yours. Of course, you are not sad,\" Tang Zheng roared in exasperation.\n\nTian Chanzi remained silent. He had cultivated for hundreds or thousands of years and had long since accepted the cycles of life and death, not having the strong feelings that Tang Zheng had.\n\n\"Grandpa cannot die. Aren't you a cultivator? You must have a way to save him, right?\" Tang Zheng's eyes lit up, and he asked eagerly.\n\n\"I am just a wisp of spiritual consciousness, I have no way to save him.\"\n\nTang Zheng's heart sank. If even Tian Chanzi had no solution, did that mean his grandfather was truly beyond help?\n\nSeeing his dejected look, Tian Chanzi changed the subject and said hesitantly, \"...Perhaps there is a glimmer of hope... but it's almost impossible, unless a miracle happens.\"\n\nTang Zheng was overjoyed. \"Please don't speak in such a dramatic fashion, you'll scare me to death! What's the way? I'm not afraid of difficulties. No matter how bitter it is, as long as I can save Grandpa, I am willing to bear it.\"\n\n\"There is a pill called the Longevity Pill, which can extend his lifespan by ten years,\" Tian Chanzi said profoundly.\n\n\"Longevity Pill? Where can I find such a pill?\"\n\n\"I don't have it, but you can refine it. As long as you reach the third stage of Qi Condensation and find the main ingredient for the Longevity Pill, the Sky Fragrance Flower, I can teach you the method to refine the Longevity Pill.\"\n\n\"Then I will definitely cultivate to the third stage of Qi Condensation as soon as possible. Where can I find the Sky Fragrance Flower, and how much longer can my grandfather hold on?\"\n\n\"Your grandfather's body can last for another month, so you must reach the third stage of Qi Condensation within this month. As for the Sky Fragrance Flower, it generally grows on cliffs and steep mountains. You will have to find it yourself.\"\n\n\"Cliffs and steep mountains.\" Tang Zheng's heart stirred. In the suburbs of Changheng City, there was a high mountain called Changheng Mountain, over two thousand meters above sea level. Changheng City was named after this mountain. \"I can only try my luck at Changheng Mountain. I must find the Sky Fragrance Flower.\"\n\n\"The Sky Fragrance Flower was rare even in ancient times, let alone now. Moreover, you must reach the third stage of Qi Condensation within this month. Ordinary cultivators take two years to go from the first stage to the third stage of Qi Condensation, and you only have one month...\"\n\n\"Didn't you say that my one day of cultivation is equivalent to one month for others? Then wouldn't I reach the third stage of Qi Condensation in twenty days, which is equivalent to two years of cultivation for others?\" Tang Zheng said confidently.\n\nTian Chanzi immediately poured cold water on him. \"Kid, you're thinking too easily. If cultivation were so easy, wouldn't everyone in the world be a master? You are just starting to cultivate now, so the speed will be very fast. In a few days, it will slow down to the pace of ordinary people. Furthermore, I've observed that the spiritual energy in this era is very thin, much worse than the cultivation environment a thousand years ago. Reaching the third stage of Qi Condensation within a month is not as easy as you say.\"\n\nTang Zheng's heart chilled. He was indeed too optimistic. But even with difficulties, for his grandfather's life, he had to overcome them. He gritted his teeth and said firmly, \"For Grandpa, I must succeed!\"\n\nTang Zheng exerted all his strength and continued to practice, circulating the cultivation technique of the Heavenly Passage Ancient Scroll over and over again, his true qi growing stronger bit by bit.\n\nThe sky gradually showed the color of fish belly white. Tang Zheng finished practicing, made breakfast, called his grandfather to get up for breakfast, and then warned him not to go out to work again before heading to school.\n\nAlthough his top priority was cultivation, he couldn't skip class. Otherwise, his grandfather would be even more saddened.\n\nAt the entrance of Tianpeng International School, various luxury cars were arriving one after another, like a car show. Many students got out of luxury cars and walked into the school gate arrogantly.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, wait for me.\" A pleasant voice called out to Tang Zheng. He stopped and turned to see Fang Shishi getting out of a luxury car, carrying her schoolbag and walking quickly towards him.\n\nYesterday, almost all the classmates believed he had stolen money. Only Fang Shishi believed him. He couldn't help but feel grateful.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, let's go together.\" Fang Shishi smiled charmingly, her breath fragrant, and her fair skin glowed under the sun.\n\nTang Zheng nodded, and the two walked into the campus together.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, I heard you were transferred to Class Seven,\" Fang Shishi said sadly.\n\nTang Zheng's mouth curled into a wry smile. \"Good news never gets out, but bad news travels a thousand miles.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"It's not your fault, why are you apologizing?\"\n\n\"No, the school initially decided to expel you, and I asked my dad to let you stay in Class One. But later, other directors objected, so you had to be temporarily wronged and transferred to Class Seven,\" Fang Shishi said with a hint of apology.\n\nTang Zheng was furious. The school actually wanted to expel him! This must have been that old witch causing trouble. Fortunately, with Fang Shishi's help, otherwise, he might have really been expelled from school.\n\nFang Shishi's father, Fang Chongguo, was one of the directors of Tianpeng International School. If he hadn't intervened, Tang Zheng would have found it difficult to remain at the school.\n\nAfter the anger subsided, an unspeakable sense of gratitude surged in his heart. He looked at Fang Shishi with burning eyes and said sincerely, \"Fang Shishi, thank you!\"\n\nFang Shishi's pretty face flushed under his intense gaze, more alluring than the morning sun. She smiled faintly and said, \"We are classmates, no need to be so polite. I believe your academic performance will surely recover.\"\n\nTang Zheng had almost lost confidence in himself, but he didn't expect Fang Shishi to still believe in him so much. This was the second person besides his grandfather who believed in him so much, giving him a peculiar feeling.\n\n\"Kid, I have good news for you. I've found a girl with sufficiently powerful pure Yin energy,\" Tian Chanzi's voice suddenly rang out.\n\nTang Zheng was greatly surprised. \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Hehe, your luck is really good. She's far away, but also right beside you. This girl next to you is a pure Yin body with exceptionally strong pure Yin energy,\" Tian Chanzi chuckled sinisterly. \"Women's bodies are divided into different constitutions based on the amount of pure Yin energy. Besides ordinary constitutions, there are also pure Yin bodies, profound Yin bodies, Yin Fiend bodies, and Nine Yin Sacred Bodies.\"\n\n\"Fang Shishi.\" Tang Zheng subconsciously glanced at her and saw her lips curved into a faint smile, like a detached lotus, making his heart flutter.\n\n\"If she were really my girlfriend, it would indeed be a great blessing in life.\" Tang Zheng knew that many people at school would do anything to be Fang Shishi's boyfriend, but she rejected them all.\n\n\"Her family is so good, can I pursue her?\"\n\n\"Kid, you're too self-deprecating. You are a cultivator now. It's her honor to have you fancy her,\" Tian Chanzi scolded him sternly. Suddenly, he let out a scream, \"What's going on? How are you already absorbing her pure Yin energy?\"\n\n\"Why are you shouting like a startled bird?\"\n\n\"Kid, you can absorb a woman's pure Yin energy without getting into bed? Is this the mystery of the Nine Yang Sacred Body?\" Tian Chanzi exclaimed.\n\nTang Zheng was overjoyed. \"Are you saying that as long as I stay by her side, I can absorb pure Yin energy?\"\n\nThis was unbelievable, but Tian Chanzi had to admit it was true.\n\n\"No, this is definitely not the effect of the Nine Yang Sacred Body. Otherwise, people with the Nine Yang Sacred Body wouldn't have died from it before. This must be the effect of the Heavenly Passage Ancient Scroll.\"\n\nTang Zheng didn't care what the reason was. In short, he had a way to absorb pure Yin energy, and he could do it just by staying by a girl's side, which was a thousand times easier than sleeping with her.\n\n\"Kid, don't be happy too early. This absorption speed is much slower, unless you spend a lot of time with her.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I will definitely create opportunities to spend more time with her.\" Tang Zheng's mood improved since he found a solution.\n\nAs they spoke, the two arrived at the door of Class One, Senior High.\n\n\"I'm going in first. Good luck, classmate Tang Zheng!\" Fang Shishi waved her fist in encouragement, then skipped into the classroom like a fairy.\n\nTang Zheng nodded, watched her go in, then looked at the plaque on the door that read \"Class One, Senior High.\" He felt the countless mocking glances coming from inside the classroom and sneered inwardly, \"Go ahead and mock me. I will trample all of you under my feet during the college entrance examination!\"\n\nQiao Fei sat in the classroom, his face covered with gauze, feeling a dull pain. He looked at Tang Zheng from afar, then glanced at the blushing Fang Shishi, a sinister glint flashing in his eyes.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, you've been expelled from Class One, yet you can still win Fang Shishi's attention? Outrageous! Hmph, it seems that expelling you from Class One is not enough. I must ruin your reputation completely.\"\n\nTang Zheng didn't notice this sinister gaze. He strode forward, like a warrior marching towards Class Seven.\n\nClass Seven, Senior High, the \"Hell Class,\" was at the end of the corridor. The classroom was eerily quiet and filled with people.\n\nTang Zheng felt a flicker of surprise. When he passed Class Seven before, it was always noisy like a marketplace, but it had never been this quiet. However, he didn't pay attention and walked straight in.\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\nSuddenly, a strange sound echoed from above.",

    "content": "Tang Zheng heard the commotion above and his heart tightened. Without looking up, he shuffled forward a meter in an instant.\n\nSplash!\n\nA large bucket of water poured onto the floor at the doorway, splashing droplets everywhere.\n\nThe entire class stared at the scene, their previously smirking, \"watching the show\" expressions replaced with dumbfounded astonishment.\n\nWhat… what happened? Why did the tried-and-true trick fail? Why wasn't Tang Zheng soaked like a drowned rat?\n\nA show of dominance!\n\nA faint, elusive smile tugged at the corner of Tang Zheng's mouth. This Hell Class was truly not simple, to welcome newcomers in such a fashion.\n\nHe glanced at the stunned crowd and found two empty seats in the last row. Without a word, he walked over and sat down.\n\nInstantly, the expressions of those around him became even more complicated. Many people's eyes held a hint of schadenfreude.\n\nJingle jingle!\n\nThe bell for class rang, and the sound of high heels striking the ground grew closer. Suddenly, almost all the boys sat up straight, holding their breath, craning their necks like giraffes to look towards the doorway.\n\nA beautiful figure appeared at the entrance, and in that instant, the classroom seemed to gain a touch of radiance, making the air feel fresher.\n\nTang Zheng could even hear the sound of many people swallowing. A flicker of astonishment involuntarily flashed in his eyes.\n\nGoddess!\n\nThis was the only thought that flashed through his mind. She had a melon-seed face, willow-leaf eyebrows, and a slender waist. Dressed in a professional suit, her expression was icy – an absolute ice queen.\n\nAlthough Tang Zheng had seen other teachers wear this suit, they couldn't compare to her at all.\n\nThe professional suit perfectly accentuated her graceful figure, her ample chest seeming ready to burst out of the fabric, and her long, slender legs were adorned with black stockings, which was simply to die for.\n\nThis was enough to be a fatal temptation even for seasoned veterans of romance, let alone a group of adolescent boys with excessive hormonal secretions in their late teens.\n\nEspecially that cold face, which made one feel inferior yet irresistibly drawn to imagine more.\n\n\"Is she the teacher for this class?\" Tang Zheng wondered, as he had never seen her before.\n\nShe paused at the doorway, glanced at the water stains on the floor, and frowned slightly. Her willow-leaf eyebrows curved slightly, exuding an infinite charm.\n\nShe walked to the podium and placed the textbook she was holding on it. The fullness of her chest was even more apparent, appearing even grander and more spectacular.\n\nMany girls cast envious glances, then dejectedly lowered their heads, feeling ashamed of their own small chests.\n\n\"Class begins,\" she said softly.\n\n\"Stand up,\" a chubby boy in front of Tang Zheng shouted loudly.\n\n\"Good morning, teacher,\" everyone stood up. The boys shouted enthusiastically, as if they had been injected with chicken blood, while the girls responded weakly.\n\nShe nodded, signaling everyone to sit. Her gaze swept across the room and landed on Tang Zheng. She said coldly, \"New student Tang Zheng, I am your homeroom teacher, Liu Qingmei. Please introduce yourself.\"\n\nTang Zheng stood up, looked at everyone, and said indifferently, \"My name is Tang Zheng. Tang from Tang, Zheng from Zheng.\"\n\nLiu Qingmei nodded, satisfied with his brevity. She didn't like verbose people.\n\nShe knew a little about Tang Zheng's situation – the former prodigy falling to the bottom. This was a devastating blow to anyone. However, seeing the strong confidence in his words, she looked at him with new eyes and felt a touch of curiosity.\n\n\"Sit down,\" Liu Qingmei said, looking at his seat, a hint of surprise in her eyes. \"Don't you need to change your seat?\"\n\nTang Zheng didn't understand. This seat was in the last row and in the corner, a spot that was hard to notice, which he couldn't have asked for more.\n\n\"No need, thank you, teacher.\"\n\nLiu Qingmei swallowed. She didn't persuade him further. The others wore expressions of schadenfreude, which left Tang Zheng bewildered.\n\nLiu Qingmei began the lesson. Tang Zheng listened quietly for a while. She taught methodically and captivatingly, naturally drawing people's attention.\n\n\"She looks only twenty-five or twenty-six, yet she teaches very effectively, better than many veteran teachers. Truly impressive,\" Tang Zheng marveled inwardly.\n\nThe blood clot in his brain had completely dissolved, and the vast amount of knowledge had returned to his mind. These lessons were already very simple for him.\n\nHe stopped listening and began cultivating the \"Tongtian Ancient Scroll.\" He didn't waste any time and had to reach the third stage of Qi Condensation as soon as possible.\n\nUnknowingly, a class ended. Liu Qingmei walked out of the classroom with her textbook. The classroom immediately turned into a marketplace, becoming lively.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, you should change your seat as soon as possible,\" the chubby boy from the front row leaned over and whispered mysteriously.\n\nTang Zheng curiously asked, \"Why should I change? I think this seat is quite good.\"\n\n\"Sigh, I'm telling you this for your own good. Otherwise, it will be too late. Oh, let me introduce myself first. My name is Feng Yong, and I'm the class monitor of Class Seven.\"\n\n\"Fatty Feng, don't spread rumors. What's wrong with this seat?\" a gruff voice roared. A tall and strong male student stood like an iron tower in front of Tang Zheng.\n\nTang Zheng glanced at him. This person was at least 1.85 meters tall, with bulging muscles, exuding a powerful aura.\n\nFeng Yong shrank his neck and quickly explained, \"Gao Dazhi, I didn't say this seat was bad. I'm just worried that classmate Tang Zheng will be sitting too far away and won't be able to see the words on the blackboard.\"\n\nGao Dazhi chuckled, ignoring Feng Yong, and looked at Tang Zheng with interest. \"You're the former number one in the entire school? Hehe, I don't think you're that impressive. Now you've fallen into our Hell Class.\"\n\n\"I think Class Seven is quite good,\" Tang Zheng said indifferently.\n\n\"Is it? Class Seven is the bottom-ranked class. For a 'top student' like you, isn't it too small a pond?\" Gao Dazhi teased.\n\n\"Since you yourself consider it the bottom-ranked class, then I have nothing more to say. You've labeled yourself as bottom-ranked; you can't represent others.\"\n\n\"Classmate Tang Zheng is right. What's wrong with our class? I believe our class will definitely improve,\" Feng Yong interjected opportunistically.\n\n\"Fatty Feng, this is not your place to speak,\" Gao Dazhi glared at him angrily. \"Tang Zheng, you are the one who is truly at the bottom, the last in the entire school, hehe, what a splendid sight.\"\n\nA hint of anger flashed in Tang Zheng's eyes, then he quickly regained his composure. His mindset was different now; there was no need to argue with Gao Dazhi.\n\nSeeing that Tang Zheng remained silent, Gao Dazhi laughed triumphantly. Just as he was about to mock him further, a sharp scolding voice rang out, \"Gao Dazhi, what are you sneakily doing in front of my seat?\"\n\nGao Dazhi trembled all over and quickly retreated three steps, a fawning smile on his face. \"Dandang Jie, I was just helping you teach this newcomer who doesn't know his limits.\"\n\nYe Dingdang strode over, her bright eyes glancing at Tang Zheng, who sat calmly as if nothing had happened. Her delicate eyebrows immediately furrowed. \"Who are you, and why are you sitting in my seat?\"\n\nGao Dazhi said with a schadenfreude-filled laugh, \"Dandang Jie, he's...\"\n\n\"Shut up, I wasn't asking you, I was asking him.\" Ye Dingdang stared directly at Tang Zheng, her tone unfriendly.\n\nGao Dazhi, intimidated into silence, immediately shut his mouth.\n\nTang Zheng watched her with interest. Dandang Jie, who was she? For a girl to make Gao Dazhi so wary, she was definitely not an ordinary person.\n\n\"My name is Tang Zheng. This seat was empty; it's not yours,\" Tang Zheng said indifferently.\n\n\"You're that bookworm Tang Zheng!\" Ye Dingdang couldn't help but feel a bit curious. \"So what if you're Tang Zheng? You still can't sit in my seat. Let me tell you, both these seats are mine.\"\n\nTang Zheng glanced at her behind, thinking that while her behind was quite perky, it wasn't big enough to occupy two seats.\n\nYe Dingdang was furious. This person was shamelessly staring at her behind, and the meaning conveyed by his gaze was obvious.\n\n\"Get up!\" Ye Dingdang shouted angrily.\n\nTang Zheng couldn't help but frown. This Dandang Jie's beauty was no less than Fang Shishi's, but her personality was vastly different; she was simply unreasonable.\n\nTang Zheng had been engrossed in his studies before and was unaware of Ye Dingdang's reputation. She was another campus beauty, on par with Fang Shishi.\n\n\"I'm going to read. Please don't disturb me,\" Tang Zheng said coldly.\n\nThe entire class's attention was drawn to them. They watched the scene with great interest. Ye Dingdang was like a goddess in Class Seven. Not only was she beautiful, but her martial arts skills were also impressive. Even a brute like Gao Dazhi was no match for her. Moreover, her background was rumored to be mysterious, and none of these rich kids dared to provoke her.\n\nThat the newcomer Tang Zheng dared to incur her wrath today was truly as if the sun had risen in the west. A good show was about to unfold.\n\nYe Dingdang was also furious. Looking left and right, she couldn't find anything special about Tang Zheng. So, she suddenly grabbed the book in Tang Zheng's hand and exclaimed, \"Hmph, I'll make sure you can't read.\"\n\nTang Zheng's arm moved, skillfully dodging her.\n\nHuh?\n\nYe Dingdang was startled. Her grappling move had never failed before; this time, it had missed.\n\nTang Zheng didn't even look up, as if nothing had happened, and continued to focus on reading.\n\n\"I must have missed just now. Let's see how I teach you a lesson now,\" Ye Dingdang consoled herself. She grabbed a corner of the desk, pulled it outwards, and simultaneously executed a \"Sweeping Thousand Armies\" move, kicking at Tang Zheng's lower body.\n\nBang!\n\nA collision sound.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nA scream rang out. Everyone involuntarily showed a hint of joy, thinking Tang Zheng was in for trouble. Who else could he have provoked but Ye Dingdang?\n\nCan Ye Dingdang be provoked?\n\nFeng Yong almost closed his eyes, unable to bear watching the brutal scene.\n\nGao Dazhi, however, had a smug grin on his face, utterly pleased. Suddenly, his expression froze. Huh? Why was it Ye Dingdang screaming and holding her foot, not Tang Zheng?\n\nHow could this outsider still be reading his book diligently, with only a chair now in front of him, as if nothing had happened?\n\nThe others also reacted, their expressions blank as they watched the scene, their brains struggling to comprehend.",

    "content": "This outsider actually used a chair to block Ye Dingdang's sweeping strike, causing her leg to hit the chair squarely. It would be strange if she didn't scream.\n\nDespicable, so despicable!\n\nAlmost everyone had this thought. Especially the boys who coveted Ye Dingdang's beauty were grinding their teeth in hatred. How could someone be so cruel to such a beautiful girl, showing no pity or tenderness?\n\n\"I'm going to kill you!\" Ye Dingdang screamed, furious.\n\n*Ring ring!*\n\nJust then, the class bell rang, and the teacher walked in. Ye Dingdang was like an exploding balloon that suddenly deflated. She gave him a fierce glare and reluctantly backed down.\n\nTang Zheng continued reading without looking up. Others, finding that the good show couldn't proceed as expected, felt greatly disappointed.\n\n\"You wait, I'll make you pay after class,\" Ye Dingdang gritted her teeth and resentfully returned to her seat.\n\nGao Dazhi was eager to try and glared fiercely at Tang Zheng before also returning to his seat, disappointed.\n\nTang Zheng and Ye Dingdang sat next to each other, almost shoulder to shoulder. He looked straight ahead, listened to the lesson for a while, and then buried his head in his book, reading on his own.\n\nYe Dingdang kept turning her head to look at him, as if trying to see through him. She thought resentfully, \"This person is quite good at pretending. Does he even understand? I heard that his head hurts when he uses his brain now, so he can only be at the bottom.\"\n\n\"Humph, ww▽w. I'll definitely beat him so hard his teeth will fall out later. How dare he act tough against me, Ye Dingdang, in Class Seven? He's just asking for humiliation.\"\n\nTang Zheng was unaware of Ye Dingdang's thoughts, nor did he care what she thought. But Tianchanzi broke the silence, saying, \"Kid, this little girl is not simple. She's a martial artist.\"\n\n\"A martial artist?\" Tang Zheng was astonished.\n\n\"Yes, there are signs of internal energy flowing in her. Martial artists, like cultivators, have their own paths for circulating power. The power within them is called 'internal energy,' not 'true qi.' This is the power they cultivate by refining their bodies through physical training and techniques. It differs somewhat from how we cultivators absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.\" Tianchanzi explained.\n\n\"How strong is she then?\" Tang Zheng couldn't help but ask out of curiosity.\n\n\"The martial artist system, like the cultivation system, is divided into seven levels: Body Refining, Postnatal, Innate, Grandmaster, Martial King, Martial Emperor, and Martial Emperor. Each level is further divided into nine ranks. The two systems correspond to each other. This little girl is at the fourth rank of Body Refining.\"\n\nTang Zheng was startled, \"Then, doesn't that mean she's stronger than me?\"\n\n\"Of course. She's practiced martial arts for at least ten years. If she's not stronger than you who's only cultivated for a day, she might as well just go and kill herself.\"\n\nTang Zheng felt ashamed. He was too eager for quick success.\n\n\"I think she's going to deal with you later. You're in for a tough time, hehe,\" Tianchanzi said with a hint of schadenfreude.\n\n\"...\" Tang Zheng was speechless. He always wanted to keep a low profile, but the tree wanted to remain still, yet the wind would not stop.\n\n\"Don't worry, I have a way to deal with her. If I can't even handle someone at the fourth rank of Body Refining, wouldn't that be a laughingstock? Where would the reputation of Tianchanzi go? You should do this and this...\" Tianchanzi confidently taught him verbally.\n\nTang Zheng breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Also, I have more good news for you. This girl is also a pure Yin body. Her pure Yin power is not inferior to Fang Shishi. You've already absorbed quite a bit of pure Yin power just by sitting next to her.\" Tianchanzi added.\n\nTang Zheng's eyes lit up. His luck was indeed incredibly good. If that's the case, as long as he sits next to Ye Dingdang in the future, he can continuously absorb pure Yin power.\n\nClass was over, and the broadcast sounded throughout the campus. It was time for break exercises, and many people were heading to the sports field.\n\nYe Dingdang suddenly stood up, crossed her arms, and glared at Tang Zheng, saying, \"Get up, and come with me to the rooftop.\"\n\nFeng Yong quickly advised, \"Dingdang Jie, Tang Zheng is our classmate. This isn't very appropriate.\"\n\nGao Dazhi came over and pushed Feng Yong. \"Fatty Feng, dare you not stand with Dingdang Jie? Are you looking for a beating?\"\n\nFeng Yong swallowed, but ultimately didn't dare to speak further.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, if you're a man, come out. What's with all the mumbling?\" Ye Dingdang said and strode out.\n\nTang Zheng stood up. Being called not a man was unbearable. Moreover, if this conflict wasn't resolved, he couldn't keep a low profile.\n\nOn the rooftop, Ye Dingdang and Gao Dazhi stood proudly, looking at Tang Zheng with amusement. Gao Dazhi said smugly, \"Dingdang Jie, how should we deal with this kid?\"\n\n\"Beat him up and make him find another class. Don't let him stay in Class Seven. I get annoyed seeing him,\" Ye Dingdang said coldly.\n\nGao Dazhi rubbed his hands together and sneered, \"Alright, it's been a while since I've dealt with someone. My hands are itching.\"\n\nTang Zheng looked at them expressionlessly, as still as a mountain.\n\nA flicker of surprise crossed Ye Dingdang's eyes. Others would be trembling with fear and begging for mercy in such a situation, but he was acting as if nothing happened. Was he foolish?\n\n\"Can we really not coexist peacefully? I don't have any real conflict with you,\" Tang Zheng asked indifferently.\n\nGao Dazhi laughed mockingly, \"You've offended Dingdang Jie and you still want to coexist peacefully? Let me tell you, it's too late to beg for mercy now.\"\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\nGao Dazhi's massive fist flew straight at Tang Zheng. Gao Dazhi was tall and strong, but his stance was unstable, relying purely on brute force, which was nothing in the eyes of an expert.\n\nA blur of motion, and Tang Zheng disappeared. Gao Dazhi's vision blurred, and he suddenly lost his target. Just as he was feeling surprised, he found his body lunging forward uncontrollably, falling onto the floor with a faceplant.\n\nYe Dingdang's pupils contracted, and she exclaimed in a low voice, \"You're a martial artist too?\"\n\nTang Zheng smiled without speaking, looking at her mysteriously. Ye Dingdang's expression shifted, and she gritted her teeth.\n\nGao Dazhi, not hearing Ye Dingdang's exclamation, scrambled up in embarrassment and rage. He was actually knocked down by Tang Zheng, which was an absolute disgrace. \"Kid, I'll make you pay a heavy price.\"\n\n\"You're not worthy,\" Tang Zheng glanced at him sideways and said indifferently. What is arrogance? This is true arrogance, low-key arrogance.\n\nGao Dazhi roared and was about to attack again when Ye Dingdang suddenly shouted, \"Stop, you're no match for him.\"\n\nGao Dazhi straightened his neck, his face flushed red, and argued, \"I was just caught off guard earlier, that's why I fell for his trick. He won't be so lucky this time.\"\n\n\"Shut up, I said you're no match for him. Didn't you hear me?\" Ye Dingdang repeated impatiently.\n\nThe tall and strong Gao Dazhi suddenly lowered his head, looking like a wronged little wife. He still glared resentfully at Tang Zheng and muttered, \"What's so great about him? I don't see it.\"\n\nYe Dingdang stepped forward a few paces and met Tang Zheng's gaze. She was similar in height to Tang Zheng, both around 1.7 meters, and her eyes were sharp, exuding a commanding heroic spirit.\n\nTang Zheng didn't flinch, his eyes as calm as still water.\n\n\"Leave Class Seven, and I'll pretend nothing happened,\" Ye Dingdang said aggressively.\n\nTang Zheng said playfully, \"Why should I leave?\"\n\n\"Because... I don't want to see you.\"\n\n\"Then can you leave Class Seven yourself?\" Tang Zheng retorted.\n\n\"Dream on!\" Ye Dingdang's eyes widened. \"If that's the case, then don't blame me for being impolite.\"\n\nAlthough she knew Tang Zheng's skills were extraordinary, she wasn't afraid. After all, she was an outstanding member of her family, with few rivals among her peers.\n\nYe Dingdang kicked out like lightning. Her elastic long leg whistled as it attacked Tang Zheng's chest.\n\nTang Zheng's gaze sharpened. An expert's move was indeed extraordinary. He tapped his toe, spun, and instantly appeared behind her, dodging the attack.\n\nYe Dingdang was prepared for this. She sneered, flipped in mid-air, and kicked down from above like a sharp saber.\n\nTang Zheng's hand shot out like lightning. The Heaven's Net Hand accurately grabbed her elastic beautiful leg. The powerful force made his tiger's mouth ache, but he had to grit his teeth and persist, as this was his only chance to win.\n\nHis strength was inferior to Ye Dingdang's. To win, he could only use clever methods.\n\n\"Let go!\" Ye Dingdang commanded sharply, her internal energy surging, preparing to shake Tang Zheng off.\n\nSuddenly, Tang Zheng's finger touched the inner side of her thigh. She felt a jolt like being electrocuted, her entire body went numb, all her strength dissolved, and she collapsed softly into Tang Zheng's arms, unable to move.\n\nTheir posture was intimate. Ye Dingdang's split leg was straddling Tang Zheng. This was also due to her practicing martial arts since childhood, her body's flexibility was far beyond ordinary people; otherwise, such a difficult move would have been impossible.\n\nYe Dingdang was shocked. That strike was clearly acupoint-striking from martial arts. Her body went numb and lost control.\n\n\"He knows acupoint-striking? Isn't this something only Postnatal martial artists can do? Could he already be a Postnatal martial artist at such a young age? How is that possible?\"\n\nYe Dingdang was extremely shocked. After all, acupoint-striking requires profound internal energy and extremely accurate knowledge of pressure points to succeed.\n\nBut Tang Zheng acted like a veteran, succeeding on the first try. How could this not shock her?\n\nYe Dingdang was immersed in shock, completely oblivious to their intimate posture. However, Gao Dazhi, watching from the side, was stunned and slapped himself hard... It hurt. This was not an illusion.\n\nGao Dazhi was enraged. This Tang Zheng was too shameless, using such despicable tactics, and even touched Ye Dingdang's thigh! That was the beautiful leg Gao Dazhi had always dreamed of, but Tang Zheng had defiled it. He was going crazy.\n\nTang Zheng breathed a sigh of relief. Tianchanzi hadn't lied to him. Although his strength was a bit lacking, this acupoint-striking skill was his trump card for victory.\n\n\"Hehe, kid, how is it? Is this move amazing?\" Tianchanzi said triumphantly. \"Let me tell you, only Postnatal martial artists can perform acupoint-striking, and you can do it now. This is the advantage of us cultivators compared to martial artists. In the early stages of cultivation, our true qi is more abundant than the internal energy of martial artists, and it has many mysterious aspects.\"\n\nTang Zheng ignored Tianchanzi's boasting and gazed intently at Ye Dingdang. So close, he could further appreciate her exquisite beauty, and his heart couldn't help but flutter.\n\nHe had never been so close to a person of the opposite sex before, especially such a great beauty. His innocent heart began to feel strange sensations.\n\nYe Dingdang came back to her senses, looking at Tang Zheng's strange gaze and their ambiguous posture. Her pretty face flushed red, and she said in a low voice, \"Quickly release my acupoints.\"\n\n\"If I release your acupoints, you'll attack again. I'm not that foolish.\"\n\n\"Will you release them, or not?\" As a proud scion, Ye Dingdang had never suffered such humiliation. She was both ashamed and annoyed.\n\n\"No,\" Tang Zheng said stubbornly.\n\n\"You...\" Ye Dingdang was choked with anger.\n\n\"What are you two doing?\" The sound of high heels clicking on the ground echoed, followed by a gasp.",

    "content": "Liu Qingmei looked at the scene in surprise. The pose was… too intimate. Didn't Feng Yong say Tang Zheng was being bullied? This kind of \"bullying\" seemed quite pleasurable.\n\nFeng Yong was stunned. He had kindly brought a teacher as a rescuer, but it seemed he had interrupted something good between the two… Tang Zheng was too powerful! He had just arrived and already progressed so quickly with the beautiful Ye Dingdang.\n\nTang Zheng and Ye Dingdang looked towards the rooftop door simultaneously, startled to see Liu Qingmei.\n\n\"Bastard, untie me!\" Ye Dingdang hissed, a mix of shame and anger.\n\nTang Zheng tapped her thigh, and Ye Dingdang regained her freedom. She retreated like lightning, creating distance between them.\n\nLiu Qingmei frowned. Ye Dingdang had always been very proud. She heard many people pursued her, but none had ever succeeded. She never expected Tang Zheng to be the first. She couldn't help but look at Tang Zheng with new eyes.\n\n\"This is a school, watch your influence,\" Liu Qingmei said coldly, then turned and left without another glance.\n\nYe Dingdang, unable to explain, cried out, \"Teacher Liu, it's not what you think!\"\n\nLiu Qingmei didn't turn back, as if she hadn't heard.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, it's all your fault!\" Ye Dingdang glared fiercely at Tang Zheng, gritting her teeth, wishing she could devour him alive.\n\nTang Zheng shrugged. \"You called me to the rooftop, who else can you blame? I just want to study seriously. Don't disturb me again.\"\n\nTang Zheng strode off the rooftop. Feng Yong looked at him with eyes full of stars, his admiration as vast and continuous as a mighty river.\n\nSo cool!\n\nNo one else in the entire school dared to be so domineering and imposing in front of Ye Dingdang.\n\n\"Dingdang, you just let him go so easily?\" Gao Dazhi asked, unwilling.\n\nYe Dingdang shot him a look and snorted, \"What else do you want?\"\n\n\"I know some people outside of school. I'll get them to deal with him,\" a ruthless glint flashed in Gao Dazhi's eyes.\n\nYe Dingdang gave a noncommittal cold laugh, thinking him an idiot. She strode away from the rooftop, leaving Gao Dazhi alone in the cold wind.\n\nYe Dingdang had considered revenge, but Tang Zheng knew acupoint striking. This meant his strength was more than one level above hers. A post-natal martial artist was already a true master. She had no way to get revenge.\n\nBut she also didn't want to return to the classroom immediately to face that face, lest she be infuriated to death. She left the school directly, being quite familiar with skipping class.\n\nTang Zheng swaggered back into the classroom, with Feng Yong trailing behind him, asking nosily, \"Tang Zheng, how did you hook up with Dingdang?\"\n\n\"Let me correct you, I have no relationship with her,\" Tang Zheng said seriously.\n\nFeng Yong chuckled slyly, \"This isn't a relationship, then what is? Hehe, that pose you two had was so passionate. So Dingdang called you to the rooftop for this? I see, she wants to pursue you! I didn't expect her to be such a forward girl. If I had known, I wouldn't have notified the teacher to interrupt your good time.\"\n\nTang Zheng was exasperated. Feng Yong had already made up his mind. He was too lazy to explain. However, Feng Yong’s good intentions in calling the teacher because he was worried Tang Zheng was being bullied made him feel much better towards him.\n\n\"Tang Zheng, from now on, you're my boss, and I'm your subordinate,\" Feng Yong suddenly declared.\n\n\"...\" Tang Zheng was dumbfounded. What was this? He had never thought about taking a subordinate. But looking at Feng Yong's sincere eyes, his heart stirred.\n\nFrom Gao Dazhi's attitude towards Feng Yong, it was clear that although he was the class monitor of Class 7, he was clearly in a weaker position. This reminded Tang Zheng of his own experiences, feeling a sense of shared misfortune.\n\n\"Alright, follow me from now on, and no one will dare bully you again,\" Tang Zheng said resolutely.\n\nFeng Yong was overjoyed and nodded vigorously. \"Yes, boss. Hehe, boss, Dingdang is so beautiful. Since she wants to chase you, boss, you're in for a lot of luck. But you can't agree too quickly with women; you have to keep them wanting more...\"\n\n\"Stop!\" Tang Zheng was exasperated. Feng Yong was actually giving him dating advice.\n\n...\n\nThe morning classes ended. Tang Zheng didn't see Ye Dingdang again and felt a little disappointed. Without the opportunity to absorb pure Yin energy, he could only focus on studying and practicing.\n\nIn the cafeteria, Tang Zheng got his food and ate with his head down.\n\nThe cafeteria at Pengcheng International School was not only luxuriously decorated but also served first-class food, incomparable to other public schools. The chefs were all five-star hotel level, with distinctions between Chinese and Western cuisine, including rare delicacies and exquisite dishes.\n\nAlthough Tang Zheng's tuition and miscellaneous fees were waived, he still had to cover his living expenses. Therefore, he chose the cheapest meals for every meal. But even so, it was a considerable expense for him.\n\n\"Look, that's Tang Zheng. The former number one in the city, now the last one. Hehe, a real genius.\"\n\n\"You don't know this yet, but he was kicked out of Class 1 and now he's in the hell class.\"\n\n\"Your information is outdated. He caused another big scandal today. They say Ye Dingdang is pursuing him.\"\n\n\"What the heck, no way! How could Ye Dingdang fancy him? How is he worthy of the heavenly beautiful Ye Dingdang?\"\n\n\"It's true! It's already exploded on the forum, absolutely explosive.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go look right now. This is definitely the biggest news of the year...\"\n\nTang Zheng initially paid no attention. He had heard so much sarcasm and ridicule in the past few months that his ears had gone numb. But when he heard the later part, he froze. How did his matter with Ye Dingdang get exposed on the forum?\n\nPengcheng Forum was created by a few students who were passionate about network technology. It was very popular among students, and almost every ripple in the school was reflected on the forum.\n\nTang Zheng's phone was not a smartphone, but an old-fashioned phone that could only make calls and send text messages, so he couldn't access the forum or see what was being said specifically. But this didn't stop him from analyzing the situation.\n\nThere were only five people at the scene at that time: Ye Dingdang, Liu Qingmei couldn't have posted it. Then there were only Gao Dazhi and Feng Yong left. Gao Dazhi had suffered a setback and wouldn't likely expose his own embarrassment. The answer was obvious: Feng Yong.\n\n\"Boss, you're here. I've been looking for you for ages.\" Speak of the devil, Feng Yong came over with his tray.\n\n\"Boss, you're famous now. Humph, let's see who dares to look down on you anymore.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"Of course, I publicized your great achievements. Boss, you don't know how many boys in the school covet Ye Dingdang. Now that Ye Dingdang is chasing you, it can make them all give up hope.\" Feng Yong said excitedly.\n\n\"The post on the forum was yours?\"\n\n\"Of course, I'm one of the forum moderators. I spent two class periods carefully writing this post. I don't think I've ever written an essay with such seriousness.\"\n\n\"Give me your phone.\" Tang Zheng took Feng Yong's phone without asking and entered the forum. He immediately saw a sticky post.\n\nThe post title was very flashy!\n\nSchool Beauty Ye Dingdang's Man!\n\nTang Zheng almost spat out blood. When did he become the school beauty's man?\n\nIn fact, even without being stickied, the post would be at the top because the replies below had already reached nearly a thousand and were still increasing rapidly.\n\nThe post detailed how Ye Dingdang was infatuated with Tang Zheng and then launched a relentless pursuit, inviting him to the rooftop to pour out her longing.\n\nFinally, the post analyzed that Ye Dingdang must have been secretly in love with him for a long time, which explained why she rejected all previous suitors. It was because she had always been in love with Tang Zheng, but they were not in the same class before, so she had no opportunity. Now that they were in the same class, she launched a fierce pursuit.\n\nIn short, the post analyzed everything logically and with evidence, making it hard not to believe.\n\nThe replies contained all sorts of comments, including many scolding Tang Zheng as a toad wanting to eat swan meat. Some also complained on behalf of themselves, wondering why they, so handsome and wealthy, couldn't receive Ye Dingdang's favor.\n\nTang Zheng read it with a mix of amusement and helplessness, not knowing what to say.\n\n\"Boss, didn't I write well? Hehe, now that the flower is taken, Dingdang is yours.\" Feng Yong offered his services enthusiastically.\n\nTang Zheng gave him a fierce glare. \"This is all your doing.\"\n\nFeng Yong was startled. \"What's wrong, boss? Is what I wrote not good enough?\"\n\n\"There's absolutely nothing between Ye Dingdang and me?\"\n\n\"I know, that was before. But something will definitely happen in the future.\"\n\n\"I want to be low-key,\" Tang Zheng said helplessly.\n\nFeng Yong grinned. \"Boss, you're a trending figure in the school. So many eyes are watching you. How can you be low-key? In my opinion, you should be high-profile, so high-profile that everyone looks up to you. That's truly cool.\"\n\nTang Zheng sighed. It was too late to blame Feng Yong now.\n\n\"Boss, look, you've now soared to number one on the campus trending figures list,\" Feng Yong said, pointing to a list on the forum.\n\nThis forum evaluated a list based on people's popularity. Tang Zheng had been a frequent visitor to the list for his excellent academic performance. The last time he made it was after his first exam after being injured, where he ranked last, attracting countless taunts and ridicule. He had been silent since then and had not made the list. But today, this explosive news allowed him to reclaim the top spot as the most trending campus figure.\n\nQiao Fei was also looking at the forum. Seeing the name at the very top of the campus trending figures list was like a steel needle piercing his heart. His eyes turned sinister.\n\n\"Damn it, how did he get back on the list? And it's because Ye Dingdang is chasing him? What a joke, how could Ye Dingdang fancy him?\"\n\nQiao Fei hadn't been indifferent to Ye Dingdang's beauty, but she was a rose with thorns. He preferred Fang Shishi, that gentle daffodil.\n\n\"A salted fish wants to turn over? Dream on! This time, I'll make sure you can never turn over again.\" Qiao Fei had an idea and went directly to Gao Dazhi.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nGao Dazhi slammed his phone fiercely onto the ground, then stomped on it a few more times in unwilling fury, roaring, \"Nonsense, utter rubbish...\"",

    "content": "Qiao Fei saw the situation and asked knowingly, \"Gao Dazhi, what's wrong? Who's made you so angry?\"\n\nGao Dazhi glanced at Qiao Fei. The two knew each other but didn't have much interaction. However, Gao Dazhi had always disliked Qiao Fei, feeling that there was a gloominess in his every gesture.\n\n\"None of your business!\" Gao Dazhi said irritably.\n\nA hint of anger flashed in Qiao Fei's eyes, and he said to himself, \"I saw an article today and felt it necessary to tell you.\"\n\n\"What article?\"\n\n\"Pencheng Forum said Ye Dingdang is pursuing Tang Zheng. I know you've been pursuing Ye Dingdang, so I came to tell you. Some people seem harmless on the surface. If you don't guard against them early, be careful of making big mistakes,\" Qiao Fei said meaningfully.\n\nGao Dazhi said angrily, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nQiao Fei smiled and said, \"You know what I mean.\"\n\n\"You want me to deal with Tang Zheng?\"\n\n\"What, scared? He's useless now, are you still afraid of him?\" Qiao Fei provoked.\n\n\"Who said I'm scared? He's nothing. I can crush him in minutes,\" Gao Dazhi retorted, but involuntarily recalled the scene on the rooftop. He had fallen flat on his face, and Ye Dingdang had been inexplicably defeated. He still didn't understand Tang Zheng's strength. Could he be pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger?\n\n\"You and Tang Zheng have been in the same class for over two years. Is he good at fighting?\" Gao Dazhi asked.\n\nQiao Fei acted as if he had heard the biggest joke, unable to contain his laughter. \"Haha, he's good at fighting? Are you kidding me? He's just a bookworm who can't even lift a chicken.\"\n\nGao Dazhi seemed to understand. If Tang Zheng was really good at fighting, he wouldn't have been hit on the head and become useless half a year ago. It seemed he was too careless today and fell into the opponent's trap.\n\n\"Gao Dazhi, Tang Zheng is insidious and cunning. If you hesitate any longer, Ye Dingdang will really become his person,\" Qiao Fei fanned the flames.\n\n\"Dream on!\" Gao Dazhi roared. He had pursued Ye Dingdang for over two years with no results. Subconsciously, he had always regarded Ye Dingdang as his own and would not allow others to touch her.\n\n\"Qiao Fei, are you trying to get me to deal with Tang Zheng for you?\" Gao Dazhi's pupils contracted, and he said coldly.\n\nAlthough Gao Dazhi was a big guy, he wasn't an idiot. He knew exactly what Qiao Fei was up to.\n\nQiao Fei sneered, \"I'm just concerned about you.\"\n\n\"Hmph, I don't have such an intimate relationship with you. However, I heard before that Tang Zheng's grades always suppressed yours. Although you are the class monitor with a prominent family background, your attention has always been less than Tang Zheng's, and even Fang Shishi looks at Tang Zheng differently. Aren't you jealous?\"\n\n\"What's there to be jealous of?\" Qiao Fei said, speaking against his will.\n\nGao Dazhi laughed heartily, \"It's pointless to lie to me. I won't expose you. Besides... that incident half a year ago when Tang Zheng was attacked, hey, I don't think it was that simple. It wouldn't have been your instigation, would it?\"\n\nQiao Fei's face changed drastically, as if his secret had been exposed. He hastily denied, \"You can eat whatever you want, but you can't say whatever you want.\"\n\nGao Dazhi shrugged, \"Whether you did it or not has nothing to do with me. Anyway, I'll make Tang Zheng look bad this time.\"\n\n\"I heard you know some thugs outside of school,\" Qiao Fei said thoughtfully.\n\nGao Dazhi sneered, neither confirming nor denying.\n\nTang Zheng returned to the classroom and found that his classmates' gazes were a little strange. He could only force a smile and continued to bury his head in studying and practicing.\n\nHe was very interested in the acupoint-pressing techniques taught by Tianchanzi, but he knew nothing about the various acupoints in the body.\n\nTianchanzi patiently explained each one to him. He learned quickly, memorizing the location and function of every acupoint.\n\nIn the future, even if he faced someone stronger than himself, with a skill in hand, he could remain invincible. However, his internal energy was not yet strong enough; he could only incapacitate opponents for five minutes. According to Tianchanzi, if the acupoint-pressing technique was practiced to its peak, it could almost paralyze a person for life, rendering them immobile.\n\nTang Zheng's heart filled with longing at the thought; this acupoint-pressing technique was truly awesome.\n\n\"Kid, this acupoint-pressing technique is ultimately just a minor skill. Our cultivator's immobilization technique is the real deal. By chanting incantations, you can make your opponent immobile without even touching them,\" Tianchanzi said disdainfully.\n\nTang Zheng was overjoyed. \"Then when can I learn the immobilization technique?\"\n\n\"Qi Refining Third Stage.\"\n\nTang Zheng gritted his teeth. He had to reach the Qi Refining Third Stage as soon as possible. This seemed to be a watershed moment; one had to be at the Qi Refining Third Stage to learn magical techniques, and also to refine the Life-Extending Pill to prolong his grandfather's life. Tang Zheng felt that his time was truly tight.\n\nThe school bell rang, and everyone packed their bags to go home. Feng Yong followed Tang Zheng, chattering endlessly.\n\n\"Boss, what school are you planning to apply to in the future? Is it Yenching University in the capital?\" Feng Yong asked curiously.\n\nTang Zheng was taken aback. He hadn't thought about this issue during the period he couldn't study. Now that he had recovered, where should he go to school? If he left Changheng City, he wouldn't be able to take care of his grandfather.\n\n\"I don't know. It's still early. We'll see,\" he said absentmindedly.\n\n\"Hehe, Boss is so smart, he'll definitely be admitted to Yenching University,\" Feng Yong said.\n\n\"Which university do you want to apply to?\" Tang Zheng asked.\n\nFeng Yong said dejectedly, \"With my grades, I'd be grateful to get into a third-tier university. However, my family has already pulled strings, and I'll also go to a university in Yenching in the future. There are more resources and connections there, and meeting more people in the future will be beneficial for me to take over the family business.\"\n\n\"What business does your family do?\" Tang Zheng asked casually.\n\nFeng Yong's face flushed with embarrassment. \"We do a little bit of business.\"\n\nSeeing that he didn't want to elaborate, Tang Zheng didn't press further.\n\n\"I don't think the people in our class are stupid. Why aren't their grades improving?\" Tang Zheng asked curiously. After listening to a few classes today, he realized that the teachers were all very skilled, no less than those in Class One.\n\nPencheng International School hired top teachers from all over the country. Even for the bottom-ranked \"hell class,\" the teachers were truly talented.\n\n\"They are all children of wealthy families. Many of them have already had their universities arranged by their families, so they don't need to study so hard,\" Feng Yong revealed the secret in one sentence.\n\nTang Zheng shook his head, unable to understand the mentality of these rich idlers. \"Relying on parents is not a long-term plan. One must be strong oneself.\"\n\nFeng Yong's face turned red. \"Boss is right.\"\n\n\"Hehe, I'm not talking about you, just speaking my mind.\"\n\n\"No, my dad often says this, but I've never paid attention to it. But it's too late to say this now. My foundation is poor, and there are only more than three months left until the college entrance examination. Cramming won't help,\" Feng Yong said with disappointment.\n\n\"No, a last-minute cram can still improve things. As long as you have confidence, your grades will definitely improve,\" Tang Zheng said firmly. \"Feng Yong, I'll tutor you in the future. I guarantee your grades will improve.\"\n\nSince Feng Yong called him boss, this boss couldn't be in vain.\n\nFeng Yong was overjoyed. With the help of a top student, his grades as a poor student would definitely improve, and his pocket money would naturally increase. Thinking of this, his eyes shone.\n\n\"During this period, I'll make time to create a study plan for you and then find time to tutor you.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay, thank you, boss.\"\n\n\"Yo, still calling him boss? Fatty, you picked the wrong person to pledge allegiance to. You picked such a scrawny kid, you have no vision.\" Suddenly, six fierce-looking thugs blocked their way.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Feng Yong asked fearfully.\n\n\"Fatty, get out of here. This has nothing to do with you,\" the thugs waved their hands impatiently, their eyes fixed on Tang Zheng.\n\n\"Are you here to deal with me?\" Tang Zheng's pupils contracted, and he involuntarily remembered being attacked a few months ago. At that time, he hadn't even clearly seen his opponent before a blunt object hit his head. Then, several people punched and kicked him until he lost consciousness. He hadn't even seen the face of a single assailant.\n\nNow that he had learned martial arts, and someone still wanted to bully him, it was simply courting death.\n\n\"Heh heh, you're Tang Zheng, right? Someone wants you to learn your lesson. People should have self-awareness. There are some people you can't covet,\" the thugs said smugly.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Haha, this kid is brain-dead from studying. Let me tell you clearly, stay away from Ye Dingdang in the future. Don't think about toad eating swan meat kind of good things.\" The thugs said arrogantly.\n\nTang Zheng helplessly glanced at Feng Yong. Feng Yong wore a distressed expression. \"Boss, I didn't know it would turn out like this.\"\n\n\"Who sent you?\" Tang Zheng asked.\n\n\"Damn it, you're not qualified to ask. Brothers, attack!\"\n\n\"Stop!\" Feng Yong nervously tried to intervene. \"Open your dog eyes and see, this is Pencheng International School. If you dare to start something here, be careful you don't get more than you can handle.\"\n\n\"Heh heh, who are you trying to scare? This kid is just a poor nobody. Who will stand up for him? Besides, this is outside the school, not inside.\" The thugs had a plan and said smugly.\n\nTang Zheng looked around and saw other students pointing and discussing, but no one came to help. The school security guards, who were about to come over, turned away disheartened after seeing it was Tang Zheng. Clearly, they knew Tang Zheng's identity; he had fallen from grace and become insignificant.\n\nThere were even people in the crowd who mocked him, saying that Tang Zheng deserved it for wanting to be with Ye Dingdang. Many of them liked Ye Dingdang and were happy to see Tang Zheng suffer.\n\nGao Dazhi and Qiao Fei were hiding in the crowd, watching from afar, with smug smiles on their lips.\n\n\"Boss, I'll hold them off. You run quickly. They won't dare to do anything to me,\" Feng Yong selflessly shielded Tang Zheng and said in a low voice.\n\nTang Zheng felt a warmth in his heart and pulled Feng Yong aside. Feng Yong anxiously advised, \"Boss, as long as you're alive, you'll have chances later. You're not their match.\"",

    "content": "\"Hahaha, kid, you're really useless, needing this fatty to protect you. You're a pretty lousy leader,\" the thug taunted.\n\nTang Jun's expression didn't change. He said to Feng Yong, \"Watch from the side. I'll be fine. They can't do anything to me.\"\n\nFeng Yong was taken aback. He had inquired about Tang Jun's situation but hadn't heard that he was a good fighter. He was about to try to persuade him again when he saw Tang Jun's determined gaze and swallowed his words.\n\nTang Jun looked around and saw that everyone was craning their necks to watch the spectacle. He didn't want to fight in front of so many people; he still wanted to keep a low profile.\n\n\"How about we go to that alley over there? It'll be troublesome to fight here,\" Tang Jun suggested.\n\nThe thug froze for a moment, then burst into a sinister laugh. \"Haha, this kid is really brain-dead from studying. Alright, we'll satisfy you, brothers. Let's go to the alley. Let me tell you, don't even think about escaping.\"\n\nIn fact, the thug felt a little uneasy fighting in front of so many people. If this kid called the police and pursued the matter, with so many witnesses, they wouldn't get off easily.\n\nSo, when they heard Tang Jun's suggestion, they were overjoyed, thinking Tang Jun was truly scared out of his wits.\n\n\"Boss, I'll go with you,\" Feng Yong said bravely and loudly.\n\n\"No need. You stand guard outside the alley and don't let anyone else come in,\" Tang Jun said. Feng Yong was about to object again, but Tang Jun stopped him with his eyes.\n\n】≦,w≈ww. The alley wasn't deep, and there was no one else. Six thugs surrounded Tang Jun in the center, smiling sinisterly.\n\n\"Tell me who sent you, and I can make you suffer a little less,\" Tang Jun said, his face unperturbed.\n\n\"Haha, kid, you really are scared silly. Brothers, attack,\" the thug ordered, and several thugs attacked with fists and feet.\n\nA cold smile played on Tang Jun's lips. He moved like lightning, unleashing the \"Heavenly Net Hand.\" A flurry of hand shadows filled the air, like a net cast from heaven, leaving the thugs nowhere to hide.\n\nBang, bang, bang...\n\nWith muffled thuds, five thugs were sent flying, crashing against the wall, letting out screams of pain and crying out for their mothers, their suffering utterly pathetic.\n\nThe leader thug stared, dumbfounded. They were defeated in the blink of an eye. This... this was too damn freaky.\n\nTang Jun walked towards him with a cold expression. The thug, scared, quickly retreated, pulling a dagger from his waist and shouting with feigned ferocity, \"Don't come any closer, or I'll stab you to death.\"\n\n\"You court death.\" Tang Jun's foot moved, and he was in front of the thug. The thug lunged forward to stab, only to find his hand empty. The dagger was inexplicably in Tang Jun's hand.\n\nTang Jun twirled the dagger, creating dazzling blades of light that confused the thug. Suddenly, a cold glint flashed, and the dagger was at the thug's throat. The thug's face turned pale with fear, and he cried out, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nHe knew he had encountered a master and that he couldn't afford to provoke him. However, he didn't intend to beg for mercy immediately; it would be too embarrassing.\n\n\"Say it, who sent you?\" Tang Jun asked coldly.\n\n\"Kill me if you dare!\" the thug said, feigning toughness.\n\nTang Jun's eyes grew cold. The thug felt a chill spread through him. Tang Jun now exuded an aura of authority with every move, especially when truly angered. The power emanating from him was something ordinary people couldn't withstand.\n\n\"Since you insist, I'll grant your wish.\" Tang Jun thrust forward, and the dagger cut through the skin on his throat.\n\nThe thug's eyes widened in shock, and he screamed in terror, \"It was Gao Dazhi, Gao Dazhi!\"\n\n\"Gao Dazhi.\" The dagger stopped. Tang Jun's thick eyebrows furrowed. Gao Dazhi, I have no quarrel with you, yet you hired people to deal with me. Hmph, very well, I will not let you off.\n\nTang Jun never actively sought trouble, but he wasn't afraid of others either. If others bullied him to his doorstep, being a coward was no different from slamming his head against a wall.\n\nBang!\n\nA palm strike to the thug's neck, and he slumped down limply.\n\nFeng Yong was like an ant on a hot pan, pacing back and forth at the alley entrance. He wanted to go in and find out what was happening, but recalling Tang Jun's firm gaze, he hesitated.\n\n\"Boss was so confident, he must be fine. May the Bodhisattva bless him, Boss, please be okay!\" Feng Yong reassured himself. Suddenly, a familiar figure walked out. His eyes lit up, and he rushed over like a bolt of lightning, circling Tang Jun. \"Boss, are you okay?\"\n\nTang Jun smiled and said, \"Do I look like I'm not okay?\"\n\n\"They didn't fight?\" Feng Yong asked, half-believing. Those guys clearly weren't easy to deal with; how could they just give up?\n\nTang Jun said mysteriously, \"We are scholars. If we can use words, we definitely won't use fists. After I gave them a lecture, they repented.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Feng Yong found it hard to believe.\n\nTang Jun didn't answer. His gaze swept around and landed on a tall figure – Gao Dazhi. Gao Dazhi also saw him and, startled, quickly averted his gaze from Tang Jun.\n\nGao Dazhi was puzzled. Why was Tang Jun unharmed? Why wasn't he bruised and battered? Did those thugs take the money and not do the job? That was really unethical.\n\nBut he didn't have time to think further, as Tang Jun was walking directly towards him.\n\nGao Dazhi quickly tried to hide behind the crowd. Others also looked at Tang Jun with surprise, especially Qiao Fei, who was dumbfounded, his mouth agape, almost large enough to fit an egg.\n\n\"Gao Dazhi, why are you running?\" Tang Jun called out playfully.\n\nGao Dazhi had no choice but to stop and turn around, his face looking unpleasant. \"Where am I running?\"\n\n\"Did you do something you regret, so you have to escape?\"\n\n\"Who did something they regret? Don't slander me,\" Gao Dazhi retorted, his face flushing red. Before, he hadn't taken Tang Jun seriously, but now, Tang Jun seemed mysterious to him, making him involuntarily wary.\n\n\"Those thugs have already revealed you. Are you still going to deny it?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, I have nothing more to say to you. I'm going home.\" Gao Dazhi said and hurried to leave.\n\nHow could Tang Jun let him get away? But with so many people around, he couldn't do anything to him. However, if he didn't teach him a lesson, how could he vent his anger?\n\nHe flicked his finger, and Gao Dazhi immediately became immobile, frozen in his forward-moving posture as if he were a statue.\n\n\"What did you do?\" Gao Dazhi exclaimed in shock. He struggled with all his might but still couldn't move.\n\nTang Jun smiled enigmatically and walked away on his own.\n\nGao Dazhi panicked. He had never encountered such a situation; it was as if he had seen a ghost. He yelled, \"Tang Jun, don't go, let me go!\"\n\nTang Jun ignored him and strode away. Feng Yong stared dumbfounded at the comical Gao Dazhi for a moment, then sprinted to catch up with Tang Jun, asking, \"Boss, what happened to him? Why did he turn into a wooden log?\"\n\nTang Jun shrugged and said, \"Perhaps he did too many bad things and was punished by heaven.\"\n\n\"He deserves it! You don't know how arrogant Gao Dazhi usually is. Relying on his size, he bullies the weak. Many people in our class hate him to death. By the way, Boss, that bucket of water on the classroom door when you entered today was put there by him. He often plays pranks on people,\" Feng Yong said with satisfaction.\n\nTang Jun understood. Feng Yong, as class monitor, must have been bullied by Gao Dazhi quite a bit. He became even more indignant towards Gao Dazhi. However, since they were classmates, he would just teach him a lesson this time, using acupoint striking to make him suffer a few minutes of humiliation.\n\n\"From now on, he won't be able to bully people anymore,\" Tang Jun said lightly.\n\nFeng Yong's eyes lit up. He understood perfectly. Although Tang Jun didn't say it explicitly, Gao Dazhi's predicament was definitely related to him. Following such a boss would be awesome.\n\n\"Tang Jun, don't go, hurry up and let me go...\" Gao Dazhi cried out desperately, attracting everyone's attention. Looking at his face, redder than a monkey's backside, people pointed and sneered.\n\nGao Dazhi was going crazy. He had never suffered such humiliation. What the hell was going on? A deep sense of fear began to arise in his heart.\n\nQiao Fei watched from the sidelines, completely baffled. Gao Dazhi was clearly not acting; something must have happened to him. But it was beyond his imagination. He hadn't seen Tang Jun make any moves, so why had Gao Dazhi become like a puppet?\n\nQiao Fei's heart stirred, and he quickly ran into the alley, only to find it empty. Those thugs had already fled, and he had no way to ask what had just happened.\n\nQiao Fei's expression became uncertain. He gazed into the distance where Tang Jun had disappeared, gritting his teeth hatefully. \"What happened to this good-for-nothing? Why did he suddenly seem like a completely different person?\"\n\nPlop!\n\nSuddenly, there was a dull thud, followed by a scream. Gao Dazhi fell face-first, looking utterly pathetic.\n\nThe acupoint striking technique only lasted for five minutes. After five minutes, Gao Dazhi's acupoints were automatically unsealed, but he maintained his forward-moving posture. He had been struggling forcefully, and when he was suddenly freed, he lost his balance and fell.\n\n\"Hahaha...\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in deafening laughter. Gao Dazhi wished he could find a crack in the ground to crawl into. He scrambled up in embarrassment and fled the school as if escaping.\n\nThis scene was immediately spread to the Pengcheng Forum by busybodies. Although no one understood what had happened to Gao Dazhi, one thing was certain: he had been thoroughly humiliated by Tang Jun. In short, Gao Dazhi lost all face, and Tang Jun's popularity soared, his ranking on the campus popularity list far surpassing the second place.\n\nHowever, Gao Dazhi also made it onto the campus popularity list because of this incident, but everyone was ridiculing him. Gao Dazhi could never have imagined he would be listed in this way.\n\nTang Jun parted ways with Feng Yong and then ran all the way home. Suddenly, he stopped. He looked at his humble, low-roofed house from a distance. The area in front of the house was a mess, with things thrown everywhere, including his old books, which his grandfather had treasured like jewels.\n\nHis heart turned cold, and his face changed dramatically. He rushed towards the house, shouting, \"Grandpa...\"",
