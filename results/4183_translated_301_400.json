    "content": "\"What are you looking at?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked as he drove.\n\n\"The prison.\"\n\n\"Why, do you like it there? Want to go in? My job is to send people who should go to that place inside.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a coincidence, my job is like that too.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng was stunned for a moment but didn't ask further. Honestly, every time he was with Zhou Ze, he felt his worldview was being violently impacted.\n\nZhang Yanfeng stopped the car at the entrance of the town ahead.\n\n\"I'm going to buy some cigarettes. What do you want to drink? It's boiling hot today.\"\n\n\"Whatever.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng got out to buy water. There was a small supermarket ahead, and next to it was a lottery shop. Several people were standing at the entrance, seemingly arguing about something, but when they saw a police car drive over and stop there, and a uniformed police officer also walking towards them, the people who were still arguing immediately took off running!\n\n\"Stop, stop!!!\"\n\nAs a seasoned criminal investigator, if Zhang Yanfeng couldn't tell there was something fishy going on then, he might as well just find a piece of tofu and kill himself.\n\nAt that moment, Old Zhang, who had initially intended to buy cigarettes and drinks, had to embark on a marathon chase with the people ahead.\n\nZhou Ze saw this. He also got out of the car, but instead of helping Old Zhang chase people, he took out the last cigarette from his pack and lit it.\n\nJust as he exhaled a smoke ring, one of the young men who had been chased by Old Zhang actually circled back. They must have scattered and run in different directions. Old Zhang had no choice but to chase one of them fiercely, as he couldn't split himself into clones.\n\nThe young man had specifically run back to retrieve an electric scooter. He jumped directly onto the scooter, inserted the key to unlock and start it, all in one fluid motion.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. Although he was too lazy to bother and had no interest in playing a game of chase with Old Zhang, at this moment, since the person had actively appeared before him, it would be unreasonable to let him leave.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze walked over and, before the other person could start the scooter, slapped him directly across the face. It was actually advisable to wear a helmet when riding an electric scooter these days, but very few people actually did, and this person certainly didn't. So, Boss Zhou's slap landed squarely.\n\nThe young man happened to be turning the accelerator to speed up. He was caught off guard by the slap and was stunned. The scooter moved forward, but he stopped, falling directly off it, while the electric scooter landed a few meters ahead.\n\n\"Police, don't move.\" Zhou Ze commanded, a cigarette in his mouth.\n\nThe young man squatted on the ground, his gaze constantly scanning Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Heh, you're not a cop.\" Before Zhou Ze could ask how he was so accurate at identifying people, the other person pulled out a spring-loaded knife from his pocket and charged at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively took a step back. This time, Boss Zhou guaranteed, he hadn't forgotten he had armor!!! He really hadn't forgotten!\n\nHowever, there were many shops at the town entrance, and quite a few onlookers were enjoying the spectacle of the police catching someone. Some people were even holding up their phones, filming videos to post on their Moments for bragging rights. If Boss Zhou summoned his armor at this moment, although he could become invulnerable and easily take down the idiot in front of him, he would also become famous. By then, these videos and the crowd's observations would spread, likely shocking many people: \"Oh my god, the Armor Hero is real!\"\n\nAs Zhou Ze retreated, the young man instantly retracted his knife, preparing to get back up and retrieve the scooter to escape again. He didn't actually intend to stab anyone. But when the young man turned around, he felt the person behind him, who had just stepped back, rushing forward again. At that moment, he couldn't worry about anything else and directly turned, slashing with the knife.\n\nActually, with this kind of spring-loaded knife, those who truly know how to use it usually stab. It's not like those ancient swords. Slashing and chopping can only cause superficial wounds. A stab wound is truly terrifying. In his previous life as a doctor, Zhou Ze had handled an emergency case. The patient was a middle school student who got into an argument with another middle school student and was stabbed with a spring-loaded knife by the latter. The wound was too deep, injuring his internal organs. Despite all-out efforts to save him, they couldn't. The one who stabbed him was also dumbfounded and knelt on the ground at the hospital, begging the doctors to save the person.\n\nOf course, although this kind of slash was not fatal, Boss Zhou was not a masochist and didn't think having a few more scars would make him more imposing. At that moment, his right fingernails grew out a bit, and he reached out to grab the spring-loaded knife. It was impossible to perform an Armor Hero transformation for the onlookers, but performing a disarm with bare hands was not a problem. With a \"squeak,\" the spring-loaded knife was caught by Zhou Ze's fingernails and then began to twist.\n\nThe young man was stunned into silence. It couldn't be helped; not only was he a rash youth, but even those desperate criminals who had taken lives – how many of them had experience fighting zombies? Taking advantage of the other person's daze, Zhou Ze quickly closed the distance, and his fingernails pierced the opponent's wrist. The young man trembled violently, foamed at the mouth, and collapsed to the ground as if having an epileptic seizure.\n\nBoss Zhou spat out the cigarette butt, sat on the young man, and called out to the aunt in the hardware store opposite who was enthusiastically filming with her phone: \"Excuse me, can I borrow a rope!\" The aunt immediately nodded, went back into the store, and looked around. She couldn't find a suitable rope, but she was decisive and directly pulled down the telephone line from the shop, handing it to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Zhou Ze used the telephone line to tie up the person's hands underneath him and then sat to the side.\n\nOn the other side, Zhang Yanfeng also returned, escorting a middle-aged man with handcuffs on his wrists.\n\n\"You're pretty good,\" Zhang Yanfeng said, looking at Zhou Ze with some surprise. Then he took out his phone and called the bureau. Although they hadn't interrogated them yet and didn't know exactly what they had done, anyone with eyes could tell that people who ran away as soon as they saw the police were definitely up to no good.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, police officers from the local police station arrived and helped take the two captured individuals to the police station for custody.\n\nZhang Yanfeng patted the dust off his clothes, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and sighed with relief, saying, \"Damn, I'm exhausted. They really can run.\"\n\n\"You do run quite fast.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I still lost one.\" Zhang Yanfeng gritted his teeth. Given the unclear situation, he couldn't open fire. If he were pursuing lawbreakers in a straightforward manner and they tried to escape, he could fire to stop them, but Officer Zhang couldn't bring himself to shoot based solely on suspicion.\n\n\"In America, they would have just shot,\" Zhou Ze teased.\n\n\"That's why I personally feel America is less secure than here.\" Zhang Yanfeng bought cigarettes from the small supermarket, took two bottles of water, and tossed one to Zhou Ze. Then, he received another call, hung up, and nodded to Zhou Ze: \"Colleagues from the bureau are also coming. Want to sit in on the interrogation?\"\n\n\"Is that appropriate?\"\n\n\"Getting a consultant position at the police department is very simple. Back when my dad was a policeman, economic fraud cases were just starting to become common. Making those old criminal investigators, who only knew how to catch criminals, handle economic fraud cases made their heads spin. They only got a handle on it by finding consultants. Police officers aren't omnipotent warriors or encyclopedias. Finding a few helpers or consultants isn't hard to understand.\"\n\n\"What do you think they were doing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I'm not sure, but running when they saw the police, I'd guess they might be dealing in drugs.\" At this moment, Zhang Yanfeng seemed to remember something and immediately rushed to the entrance of the lottery shop where several people had gathered. He found no one inside and asked a neighbor, \"Where's the person who sells lottery tickets?\"\n\n\"Yellow Hair, he ran. He ran when you were chasing people. His home is nearby,\" the owner of the supermarket next door replied.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Zhang Yanfeng smashed the iced cola in his hand onto the ground and asked, \"Where does he live?\"\n\n\"Turn left up ahead, it's the white two-story house with a red iron gate.\" Zhang Yanfeng immediately ran over, and Zhou Ze could only follow.\n\nThe iron gate was open. The two walked into the house and found that the room doors inside were also open. An old grandmother sat in the living room, leaning on her cane. She looked puzzled to see two strangers barging in.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm a police officer. The young man with yellow hair who runs the lottery stall on the street... is he living here?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"He's my grandson...\" The old grandmother hesitated, as if in a mental struggle, then immediately said, \"He just ran home, grabbed a bag of things, and then ran out again, saying he was going to hide. Police officers, did my grandson do anything illegal? You must help him. My grandson isn't a bad person. His parents work far away, and no one looks after him. He stopped going to school early...\" As she spoke, the old grandmother dropped her cane and knelt down, hugging Zhang Yanfeng's leg.\n\n\"Old lady... you... please get up... you...\"\n\n\"What did he take?\" Zhang Yanfeng helped the old lady up and asked.\n\n\"I don't know. He went to his room...\" The old grandmother pointed to a room inside, \"He took a bag of things and ran out.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately went into the room and found some coins scattered on the floor. Zhou Ze walked over, squatted down, picked up a coin, and then frowned, a look of disgust appearing on his face. The coins were Qianlong Tongbao.\n\n\"Smuggling cultural relics?\" Zhang Yanfeng guessed, as the investigation and interrogation had not yet yielded results.\n\n\"No, it can be more precise.\" Zhou Ze pointed at the coins, \"It's probably from tomb robbing.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because it smells like corpse stench.\" A while ago, Old Xu was poisoned by a corpse. Zhou Ze was busy finding ways to detoxify him, and Old Xu had this smell on him then – the foul odor that appears long after death.",

    "title": "Chapter 299: The Death of Huang Mao",
    "content": "The interrogation process encountered a slight hitch, but under Zhang Yanfeng's lead, the disruption was quickly smoothed over.\n\nThe two individuals initially apprehended attempted to remain silent, claiming they were merely nervous around \"Uncle Police\" and felt uneasy. The younger one was manageable, but the middle-aged man, having a criminal record, stated he had an inherent fear of police officers. He explained that seeing a police car made his chest feel tight, and encountering an officer approaching made it difficult to breathe, so he instinctively ran away to avoid suffocating.\n\nHowever, as the interrogation progressed, the younger one, Zhou Ze's apprehension, confessed first. The middle-aged man could only follow suit.\n\nIndeed, Boss Zhou's judgment was correct; they were tomb robbers. It's common knowledge that Luoyang and Xianyang have many ancient tombs, as numerous dynasties established their capitals there. Tongcheng, in comparison, is somewhat lacking in historical significance, and no major burial sites have been reported.\n\nHowever, according to the confession of these tomb robbers, they were actually targeting small tombs belonging to Qing Dynasty minor landlords. Their method was to pilfer small artifacts, relying on quantity for profit, and they usually had a decent haul.\n\nRecently, however, an incident occurred. In one of these small tombs, their team of six lost two members. The remaining four were terrified. Previously, they felt safe targeting only small tombs, believing they wouldn't encounter traps or dangers. But after losing two people, they realized the seriousness of the situation. So, when Zhang Yanfeng drove past the area, the four of them were at a lottery shop discussing how to sell their illicit gains and flee. Of the six members, only Huang Mao, who ran the lottery shop, was local. The others were from out of town, and splitting the money and running off seemed like a safe plan.\n\nEmerging from the interrogation room, Zhang Yanfeng was sipping tea from a thermos. Zhou Ze sat on a bench outside, having listened to the entire process. Seeing Zhang Yanfeng walk out, and given the police station environment, Zhou Ze felt he resembled a positive character from a police drama, the kind often destined for a sacrificial, tear-jerking role in the latter part of the plot.\n\nZhang Yanfeng was unaware of Zhou Ze's thoughts. If he had known, he likely would have charged at him with a round of military combat training.\n\n\"I'll have someone drive you back,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"Using official vehicles for personal use?\"\n\n\"You helped apprehend a suspect; it's only proper.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nBoss Zhou stood up. Honestly, he wasn't very interested in investigating cases. With two of the four suspects already caught, the remaining two were merely a matter of pursuit.\n\n\"I'll take people to check out the small tomb where the deceased were later this afternoon. These darn people, they left two dead bodies down there and didn't even retrieve them. Instead, they reburied the entrance they had dug up themselves.\"\n\n*Wouldn't it be more foolish to bring the bodies out and deal with them?* Zhou Ze mused.\n\nZhang Yanfeng arranged for a female police officer with a ponytail to drive Zhou Ze home. The officer was quite tall, estimated at around 1.75 meters, but very slender, like a straight, sharpened pencil, standing like a marker.\n\n\"Mr. Zhou, this way, please.\"\n\nThe officer politely invited Zhou Ze to the parking lot. They weren't driving a police car, but a private vehicle. As Zhou Ze got in, he could smell the woman's perfume, and the interior was decorated in a girlish style. Everyone has a professional side and a personal side; police officers are people too, which is understandable.\n\nZhou Ze recalled his previous life as a surgeon, knowing doctors with peculiar habits – some played \"Heaven\" during surgery, others played \"Symphony of Fate,\" and one even liked playing Phoenix Legend and Chopstick Brothers. The daily work was already serious and tiring enough; when it's time to be playful, one should be.\n\n\"Captain Zhang gave you this book,\" the female officer said, handing a book to Zhou Ze. The cover depicted Tongcheng Prison, the book titled \"The Road to Redemption.\" Along with it was a stack of flyers.\n\n\"These are wanted posters for the two fugitives. Captain Zhang asked if you could help post them around South Main Street.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nHalf an hour later, the car arrived at the bookstore. Zhou Ze got out, and the female officer gave him a signature smile and a farewell before driving away.\n\nStanding at the entrance of the bookstore, Boss Zhou didn't rush inside. Instead, he looked at the shop next door. It was evening, but the renovation crew was still working, clearly rushing to meet the deadline. Director Lin wanted to open a pharmacy next to his shop and had spoken to him about it beforehand. Zhou Ze hadn't expected her to be so eager. Perhaps she was a little disappointed to see her former idol and mentor become such a slacker. Director Lin was gradually transforming into a strong woman. From her perspective, if the person she liked disappeared, she would create another one herself.\n\nScratching his head, Zhou Ze didn't go in to check the renovation progress. Instead, he pushed open the bookstore door and went inside.\n\n\"Zhou Ze! Zhou Ze! Zhou Ze!!!\"\n\nThe little loli was sitting on the sofa, her bare feet in the fish tank below, where many small fish were kissing her feet.\n\n\"What do you think if we set up something like this in the bookstore? People could relax here after shopping and get rid of dead skin. It could generate revenue.\"\n\nIn reality, for this bookstore located on the South Main Street pedestrian mall, any change or innovation could be considered revenue generation, as its turnover had already hit rock bottom. It was evident how sluggish the business was, as Zhou Ze hadn't stocked any new books since moving the store here, aside from daily newspapers and popular magazines.\n\nBut Boss Zhou immediately rejected the little loli's suggestion. Just imagine, every morning, waking up from Bai Yingying's embrace, going downstairs, taking a shower, coffee, newspapers, sunshine, sofa… and while he was enjoying this moment, a large group of uncles and aunties would be chatting and wiggling their feet in a fish tank. And what if one of them had athlete's foot? Ugh, the thought of it.\n\n\"If you don't like it, you don't like it, but I'm keeping this for myself,\" the little loli pouted.\n\nZhou Ze nodded; this he could tolerate. Little lolis have three treasures: delicate, weak, and easily pushed over. Looking at the little loli's feet was much more pleasing than looking at the feet of aunties.\n\nAfter dinner, Boss Zhou remembered what Zhang Yanfeng had given him. He immediately instructed the old Taoist priest to retrieve the wanted posters from the book and to go out and post them. Even the sanitation workers the next morning wouldn't clear such notices.\n\nA wanted poster was also affixed to the bookstore's entrance. At the internet cafe across the street, the old Taoist priest posted over ten flyers, from the entrance all the way to the counter, giving customers entering the cafe the illusion of returning to prison.\n\nAfter the events of that night, the internet cafe siblings hadn't approached them actively. Occasionally, they would see each other across the street and mostly act as if they hadn't. The fault lay with the classmates feeling guilty, as they had looked out for themselves that night. Boss Zhou didn't mind, but the old Taoist priest certainly held a grudge.\n\nAfter nine o'clock at night, Zhou Ze went upstairs to check on Old Xu's condition again, then looked at the potted plant. The flower bud was growing larger. After a moment's hesitation, Zhou Ze moved the potted plant from the second floor downstairs, placing it beside his usual seating spot, and then lay on the sofa, leisurely reading the newspaper.\n\nBoss Zhou disliked the smell of mosquito coils, even electric ones. However, once he moved Deadpool next to him, he felt much more comfortable; no annoying insects could approach him.\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze was staying on guard that night, the little loli went upstairs to watch TV. With Zhou Ze present, she couldn't compete for his business. Sometimes, when Boss Zhou slacked off or went upstairs to sleep early, the little loli would often guard the store alone, waiting for a destined soul.\n\nIndeed, it was like the saying, \"One monk carries water to drink; three monks have no water to drink.\" The little loli was now living with Zhou Ze, effectively closing down her previous branch. Her contribution points had surely decreased significantly as a result, but she was becoming more accepting. A diligent, good little loli ghost messenger, influenced by Zhou Ze, had transformed into a slacker loli. It was as if Boss Zhou possessed a magical charm that drew those around him, people who were diligent, healthy, and upright, under the influence of his personal charisma, causing them to fall into a leisurely, slacker lifestyle from which they couldn't escape. Even Madam Xu, who owned over twenty apartments back then, was diligently working; now, her hands were clean.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak...\" The old Taoist priest was grooming the monkey. Suddenly, the monkey started to gesture excitedly. The old Taoist priest nodded, picked up the bull's eye tears, and wiped his eyes, looking towards the bookstore entrance. He saw a figure skipping and hopping in from outside.\n\nNo surprise, no shock. The old Taoist priest, like an old madam, called out to the top earner, Ze, who was still reading: \"Customer!\" With that, the old Taoist priest immediately got up to prepare cold dishes and yellow wine in the back.\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his shoulders and stood up. He noticed that the wandering soul who came tonight was a bit restless. He was jumping as he walked, hopping tirelessly. His hair was yellow, a \"shamate\" hairstyle popular over a decade ago, which he stubbornly maintained, as if raising his finger to the sky and shouting: \"Shamate will never die!\"\n\nHowever, wait a moment. He looked a bit familiar. Zhou Ze intentionally walked to the bookstore entrance and glanced at the wanted posters the old Taoist priest had put up. The photo, the information – yes, it was him, the Huang Mao who ran the lottery shop and had escaped earlier that day. Now, he had become a ghost? Dead?\n\nHuang Mao continued to amuse himself, unable to control himself even after entering the bookstore. He was also foolishly singing a children's song:\n\n\"Loudspeaker, Suona, the tune is small and the voice is big.\nWidow, prostitute, the hole is tight, the buttocks are wide.\nBrother went in, brother came out,\nBrother went in again,\nBrother can't get out...\"",

    "content": "Zhang Yanfeng arrived by car, in the vehicle of the tall, thin female police officer. When he got out, Officer Zhang's legs were weak, his eyes bloodshot, and his disheveled hair and shoulders were mixed with a lot of grass and debris.\n\nPushing open the door and entering, Zhang Yanfeng called for a cup of coffee and then yawned heavily.\n\n\"Anyone who didn't know would think you just came back from a wild night.\"\n\nBoss Zhou stirred his coffee with a small spoon.\n\nIn the past, Zhou Ze felt that good coffee and instant Nestlé coffee were no different. When he was a doctor in his previous life, he was often busy and on his feet, and he relied on coffee to get through his days.\n\nBut he didn't know if his mindset had changed now or if there really was a big difference between good and bad coffee.\n\nDrinking coffee now tasted completely different from before.\n\n\"Nonsense, don't slander my reputation.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng directly picked up the coffee Zhou Ze had already sweetened and stirred, and drank it in one go.\n\nThen he smacked his lips,\n\nAs if he had drunk a large gulp of cool plain water,\n\nPerfectly interpreting\n\nwhat it means to chew on peonies like cattle.\n\nThe small spoon in Zhou Ze's hand fell to the ground,\n\nTrembling slightly.\n\nThis was his Kopi Luwak...\n\n\"This coffee is really boring. Don't you get tired of drinking this every day? If I had to drink this every day, I wouldn't be happy.\"\n\n\"I don't know if you'd get tired of drinking this every day, but you'd definitely be investigated for financial problems.\"\n\n\"Damn it.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng reached up and rubbed his hair.\n\n\"You know, it's unlucky. I haven't slept all night, and I've been wandering in the woods all night, falling who knows how many times, and I still haven't found that grave.\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised and asked, \"The grave of that dead person?\"\n\n\"Yeah, couldn't find it.\"\n\n\"Didn't they tell the truth?\"\n\n\"I took them with me to look, and we really couldn't find it. Tongcheng is such a small place, not like the old forests or old mountain gullies in the Northeast or Sichuan. They sealed the tomb entrance back then, it's true, but they shouldn't be unable to find it. Yet, in reality, they just can't find it.\n\nPolice dogs were deployed, and there was no discovery at all. The people have been arrested, and they've confessed everything, so there's no need for them to lie, right?\"\n\nOfficer Zhang spread his hands.\n\nHe had wasted a whole night for nothing.\n\nThen, he remembered that Zhou Ze had called him, and immediately said,\n\n\"Why did you look for me?\"\n\n\"Huang Mao is dead.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhang Yanfeng's eyes suddenly widened, and he rebuked, \"Did you kill him?\"\n\n\"........\" Zhou Ze.\n\nShaking his head, Zhang Yanfeng calmed himself and asked, \"Where is the body?\"\n\n\"I only know he's dead.\"\n\nYes,\n\nThe man's soul had arrived.\n\nBoss Zhou had already sent him to reincarnate.\n\nHuang Mao's last trace left in this world wasn't his stubborn \"Shamate\" style,\n\nbut rather the additional 0.4% performance on Boss Zhou's ghost messenger certificate.\n\n\"Did you dispose of the body?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"I didn't see the body, but I can confirm he's dead. If you still don't understand, I can give you a detailed introduction to my job.\"\n\n\"No, stop!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately raised his hand, signaling Boss Zhou to stop.\n\nHe still wanted to live a normal life. Even though he knew Zhou Ze's identity was unusual, he refused to have his worldview shattered by direct impact.\n\n\"Were you able to find where he died?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nAt this moment, the old Daoist priest beside them silently raised his hand and timidly said,\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n...\n\nWhen they went, the old Daoist priest drove. The female police officer had been sent back to rest by Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nXu Qinglang's Nissan had practically become the bookstore's public car. Normally, when Old Xu was around, he cherished this car, but since his coma, his beloved car was also being mistreated.\n\nSitting in the back seat, Zhou Ze and Officer Zhang each had a cigarette between their fingers, puffing away.\n\n\"Old Zhou, is this considered a supernatural event?\n\nThose two suspects weren't lying, I could tell, and when they themselves couldn't find the tomb, their shocked expressions weren't faked.\"\n\n\"You've been a police officer for so many years, haven't you encountered anything like this?\"\n\n\"There are really few. However, we can now write this into a supernatural event, as a secret file for the police station.\n\nIt says,\n\nOn such and such date, a police officer surnamed Zhang solved a case with the help of a mysterious bookstore owner.\"\n\n\"Usually, this kind of plot involves you dying unexpectedly, and then your son comes to investigate your cause of death, discovers my existence, and then comes to me to inquire about the truth of his father's death.\n\nThen I'll give your son some vague, nonsensical information, which is convenient for the screenwriter to pad the plot.\"\n\n\"........\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThe atmosphere was a bit awkward.\n\nThe old Daoist priest driving chuckled inwardly. Others chat to kill a conversation, but the boss can chat to kill a person.\n\nSoon, the car arrived at the location, in a town below, near the elevated highway. It was indeed a bit far from the city center, but it was actually quite fast to get there by car. A loop on the ring elevated highway and you'd be out.\n\n\"Swan Ballroom.\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the neon sign on the second floor, which was flashing. In this small town, it looked quite upscale.\n\nEspecially at this hour, past midnight,\n\nThere were many people in this ballroom, both below and above.\n\n\"This is a 'sand dance' hall,\" the old Daoist priest explained.\n\n\"Sand dance?\" Zhang Yanfeng couldn't quite understand.\n\n\"Oh, that's a saying from Sichuan. When I worked in Sichuan, I went there quite a bit. According to the local way of saying it, it should be called a close-contact dance or a摸摸舞 (touching dance).\"\n\nWith the explanation,\n\nIt became easier to understand.\n\nThe old Daoist priest, fearing that the two behind him still couldn't understand, continued, \"They play music inside, and people dance. Everyone who enters has to pay a 10 yuan entrance fee, both men and women. Then, the men choose women inside, and if he picks one, she'll dance with him. They charge per song, ten yuan or twenty yuan per song.\n\nIt's cheaper in Rongcheng, ten yuan a song. Tongcheng belongs to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai free shipping area, and the prices are expensive. Here, it's twenty yuan a song.\n\nDancing together in the dark, men can also touch and grope as they please, getting their fill. The money isn't wasted. Many of the girls are working part-time, not exclusively as prostitutes.\"\n\nBoss Zhou and Officer Zhang listened and nodded like students.\n\n\"This is pushing the boundaries,\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng exclaimed with professional instinct.\n\nBecause after entering, he found that it was quite regular inside. Posters everywhere stated: \"No Gambling, Prostitution, or Drugs.\"\n\nThere were also several security guards in uniform, wearing red armbands, maintaining order.\n\nA place like this, it's a ballroom, and it has its own licenses and procedures, just like some KTVs. It's a legitimate entertainment venue, but everyone knows and understands whether there are improper or boundary-pushing things happening inside.\n\nThe old Daoist priest paid, getting three tickets. After entering, the ballroom was clearly divided into two areas. One area had bright lights, and below, people were dancing normally, somewhat like the elderly ballroom dancing in the \"Sunset Red\" squares.\n\nIn another area, the lights were dim, and a group of men and women were swaying in each other's arms.\n\nOn the periphery, there were many men walking around looking for partners, and rows of girls standing there waiting to be chosen, with all shapes and sizes.\n\n\"A den of iniquity,\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng commented.\n\nThen, he looked at the old Daoist priest and pressed,\n\n\"You brought us to see this?\"\n\nHe was a police officer. If he were discovered by acquaintances coming to such a place, it would be very awkward. If photos were taken, it could even be used by malicious people as evidence to attack his personal conduct.\n\n\"Upstairs.\"\n\nSaying that, the old Daoist priest led the two around a corner and up the stairs. At the entrance of the staircase, an old woman was sitting there cracking melon seeds. Seeing three big men coming up, she looked a bit confused and reached out to stop them.\n\n\"What for?\" the old woman asked.\n\n\"For business!\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest replied.\n\nSaying that,\n\nThe old Daoist priest also pointed at Zhang Yanfeng and his boss.\n\nThe old woman showed a look of understanding and then waved, signaling them to go up.\n\nThere was nothing on the upper floor, it was basically a abandoned floor. However, you could see scattered condoms all over the ground, and inside, there was white sticky fluid with the smell of salted fish and seafood.\n\nNot far away, a few couples were busy.\n\n\"A den of iniquity,\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng continued.\n\n\"This place isn't managed by the ballroom downstairs, can they manage people renting rooms?\" the old Daoist priest retorted.\n\nThen, he pointed to the speaker above, which was playing lyrical music. The melody was synchronized with the music in the ballroom downstairs.\n\nBoss Zhou leaned on the railing, the view was excellent here, the floor was quite high, and in front was the elevated highway, with traffic flowing incessantly.\n\n\"What exactly are you looking for us to see!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng could no longer stand it. He was a police officer. If it were during a raid or to catch criminals, it would be fine, but now, sneaking in undercover, he felt extremely uncomfortable.\n\n\"Wait. That song Huang Mao sang earlier, I heard it here before. I thought it sounded good, so I searched for the lyrics online, but I couldn't find this song. Later, I asked someone here, and they said their boss sang it once while drunk at a KTV. It was said to be very unpleasant, so they decided to use it here.\"\n\nAfter the introduction,\n\nThe old Daoist priest urgently shouted to the old woman watching the stairs downstairs, \"Hey, sister, I see a police car coming over there!\"\n\nThe old woman's eyes narrowed. She didn't doubt him, and with such matters, it was better to be safe than sorry. She immediately took out her phone and made a call.\n\nIn less than half a minute,\n\nThe speaker above Zhou Ze, Zhang Yanfeng, and the old Daoist priest, which had been playing music, suddenly changed to a different tune.\n\n\"Horn, suona, the tune is small and the voice is loud.\nWidow, prostitute, the hole is tight, the butt is wide.\nBrother's going in, brother's coming out,\nBrother's going in again...\"\n\nThe singing was so piercing,\n\nIt was truly a masterpiece of someone drunk roaring into a microphone.\n\nAnd at this moment,\n\nSeveral couples and individuals ran out from in front of Zhou Ze. Their faces were flustered, they were tidying their clothes while quickly running down, their speed was very fast. One man's belt wasn't fastened properly, and after running a short distance, his pants fell down, causing him to trip and fall.\n\nListening to this unpleasant song,\n\nWatching the people flee in panic,\n\nThe old Daoist priest's gaze began to deepen,\n\nAs if looking out with all his might,\n\nHe saw himself from over twenty days ago...",

    "content": "\"What on earth does this mean?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng couldn't understand, as he had never seen a ghost before, and he wasn't present when the yellow-haired soul came to the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze, deep in thought, ignored the noisy commotion below, where people mistakenly believed the police were raiding a brothel. Instead, he began to search room by room.\n\nThis place likely had a layout similar to old office buildings, and at some point, it might have been converted into dormitories. Currently, some rooms had been cleaned and were used as \"bang rooms\"¹ by prostitutes. However, more than half of the rooms remained locked, covered in thick dust, clearly untouched for many years.\n\nThe owner of the dance hall knew he was operating on the fringes, so while he didn't stop these activities upstairs, he wasn't foolish enough to support them either. Consequently, no one cleaned these rooms.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze kicked open the doors one by one.\n\nClouds of dust billowed out, causing a choking sensation.\n\nSince the soul that came to the bookstore to be reincarnated sang a song from here, if the old Taoist priest was right and the song was indeed original, it was highly probable that Yellow Hair had died here.\n\nAt this moment, the security guards from the dance hall ran upstairs. One reason was the noise from above, and another was that the police hadn't arrived. The elderly aunt who reported the incident said that an old man in a robe upstairs was \"crying wolf.\"²\n\nZhang Yanfeng consciously moved to the stairwell. When the security guards came up, he stopped them.\n\nThe security guards wanted to argue further, or even try to rough up these \"jokers,\" but after Zhang Yanfeng took out his identification and showed it to them,\n\nThe security guards could only force out awkward smiles,\n\nBehaving like cute, silly Huskies,\n\nThey dared not make any further moves.\n\n\"Old Zhang, over here!\"\n\nZhou Ze called out.\n\nZhang Yanfeng, no longer paying attention to the security guards, rushed over. In a long-undisturbed room, a person was found hanging from a ceiling fan.\n\nAt first glance, he didn't look like Yellow Hair, as his hair wasn't yellow but gray. However, upon closer inspection, it was indeed Yellow Hair, because his hair was covered in dust, effectively dyeing it silver-gray.\n\nZhang Yanfeng did not enter the crime scene without authorization. Instead, he took out his phone and dialed, preparing to call for police support.\n\nAfter finishing the call,\n\nZhang Yanfeng frowned,\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze,\n\nThe body,\n\nHe had actually found it.\n\nIf he hadn't known about Zhou Ze's peculiarity,\n\nFollowing the usual procedure and habits,\n\nZhang Yanfeng would have unhesitatingly arrested Zhou Ze as the prime suspect and taken him in for questioning.\n\nIt wasn't uncommon to find murderers who killed someone and then reported the crime themselves, leading the police to the scene. In fact, a significant portion of murderers would mix with the onlookers after a crime was discovered.\n\nThis habit was akin to the first thing one does after finishing defecating on the toilet and standing up: lowering one's head to look at the stool.\n\nSoon, many police cars arrived, terrifying the dance hall's management and owner.\n\n\"Heavens,\n\nDo they need such a large contingent just for a raid on prostitutes?\n\nI'm just skirting the edge, and it's sexual skirting, not selling drugs.\"\n\nThe police quickly cordoned off the scene. The men and women in the dance hall were temporarily detained there. Because a murder had occurred and the environment was chaotic, everyone needed to provide a statement.\n\nThis caused considerable panic among the men who had come secretly with families, and... also women.\n\nProfessional forensic investigators arrived, and the scene began to be processed. Zhou Ze and the old Taoist priest completed their task and returned to their Nissan car parked outside, smoking cigarettes.\n\n\"Boss, this matter is so strange. A six-person grave-robbing crew, two died in the tomb chamber, and now the tomb is nowhere to be found. And another one died in this godforsaken place.\n\nThis poor Taoist estimates that the remaining one they didn't catch during the day is likely also in dire straits.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded; this matter indeed had a peculiar aura.\n\n\"Could it be that the souls of the tomb's owners have come out for revenge?\" the old Taoist priest speculated.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't make a judgment. If ghosts were indeed killing people, it fell under his jurisdiction.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze rarely encountered ghosts who came out for revenge. Most souls obediently followed the subtle guidance and entered the bookstore, only to be \"exploited\" by Zhou Ze and sent to hell.\n\nHowever, after being a ghost messenger for so long, Zhou Ze had gained a deeper understanding of ghosts.\n\nThe modern perception of grave robbing is mostly derived from tomb-robbing novels or television shows. But in reality, tombs that are comparable to, or even surpass, the underground palaces of Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum are exceedingly rare, so few that they can be counted on ten fingers.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's past life, when he was a doctor, he once took on a mission to lead a medical emergency response team to accompany an archaeological team for a protective excavation.\n\nThe excavation target was the tomb of a Ming Dynasty prince. At that time, tomb-robbing novels were at their peak popularity, and the younger doctors on the team were all like eager courtesans with their necks craned, clamoring for any opportunity to get close to the excavation site.\n\nZhou Ze also observed, but the result was greatly disappointing. The tomb chamber had a gate, followed by a passageway less than ten meters long, with side chambers and then the main burial chamber, which was about the size of a rural single-story house's footprint. There wasn't much to see inside.\n\nThe reason a medical team was needed was to prevent potential injuries or infections during excavation. As for tomb owners suddenly transforming into zombies and going on a killing spree, not a single hair of that sort was seen.\n\nZhou Ze estimated that the archeologists saw fewer zombies in their entire lives than he had seen in the year since his rebirth. Many people never saw one in their lifetime.\n\nHe could look in the mirror, and he could look at Yingying.\n\nThere,\n\nTwo of them.\n\nHowever, a scholar from that archaeological team had a conversation with Zhou Ze back then, saying that actually, the tombs of minor princes and nobles were quite ordinary. They followed rules, and the burial objects inside had clear standards and were in accordance with regulations. But the tombs of local small landlords and wealthy commoners were truly unimaginable.\n\nThere's a saying about the wisdom of the working people being unimaginable. When it comes to tomb chambers, this saying can be adapted: the terrifying creativity of ancient laborers is unimaginable.\n\nThat archaeological scholar gave Zhou Ze an example that he would never forget. A landlord had died, and his family, fearing he would be lonely in the afterlife, bought two children, a boy and a girl. Before sealing the tomb, they put the children inside, along with some water and food, but very little.\n\nAfter the children finished the meager provisions, they would starve to death inside, serving the deceased.\n\nTherefore, the owner of the tomb might have already gone to hell and been reincarnated, and the ones with resentment were those forced to be buried alive.\n\nPutting yourself in their shoes,\n\nIn a pitch-black, sealed tomb with no escape,\n\nWith a coffin next to you, and your food and water extremely scarce, what would your feelings be?\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze was startled and snapped out of his thoughts.\n\nIt was Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"The preliminary cause of death is suicide. No other fingerprints or signs of foul play were found at the scene.\"\n\n\"So fragile?\" the old Taoist priest muttered. \"Grave robbing isn't drug trafficking, they wouldn't get shot, right?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng shook his head.\n\n\"Suicide?\" Zhou Ze savored the words.\n\nThe most puzzling thing was why someone would choose this place to commit suicide.\n\nSome people choose tombs with considerations for mountains and water. Did Yellow Hair choose to commit suicide here thinking he could dance later if he felt lonely?\n\nCould he even grope around?\n\nMoreover, a person who commits suicide has abandoned all worldly concerns and is solely focused on death. Why would they come to his bookstore? They should have gone directly to hell.\n\n\"Captain Zhang, I just received a notification. Another body has been discovered.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter driving for forty minutes,\n\nThey arrived at the Hao River.\n\nThe body had already been recovered and placed on the lawn, covered with a white sheet.\n\nThe person who discovered the body was a restaurant worker finishing his night shift. At first, he thought someone was swimming late at night, but upon closer inspection, he realized it was a dead person floating on the water.\n\nBoss Zhou squatted beside the body and watched for a while before coming out.\n\n\"Boss, another suicidal jump?\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest emphasized the word \"suicidal.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"From when I saw him this morning and he slipped away, to now, how much time has passed? But the body's decomposition suggests it's been floating in the water for a week.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng squatted by the Hao River, smoking one cigarette after another. Initially, solving a tomb-robbing case was a good achievement. When writing promotional reports, he could say that his sharp eyes spotted them on the roadside and realized they were suspicious, proving that evil could not hide from justice.\n\nNow,\n\nOf the two suspects who escaped, one hanged himself, and the other drowned. A seemingly simple tomb-robbing case was developing into a serial murder case.\n\n\"Boss, could it be that the two accomplices left in the tomb chamber have come out for revenge?\" the old Taoist priest speculated beside him.\n\n\"Yes, let's find the tomb chamber first,\" Zhang Yanfeng gritted his teeth, threw his cigarette butt on the ground, and stomped on it fiercely with his leather shoe.\n\n\"Help me find the tomb chamber,\" Zhang Yanfeng looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"If I were you, I think I should do something else first.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"It's...\"\n\nAt this moment, Zhang Yanfeng's phone rang. He saw it was from headquarters and signaled Zhou Ze to wait a moment before answering.\n\nAs he listened,\n\nHis expression drastically changed. After hanging up the phone, he looked at Zhou Ze in a daze.\n\n\"What's up?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\n\"The two suspects I arrested with you earlier today, the older one bit his tongue and committed suicide.\n\nThe younger one also attempted to swallow foreign objects to commit suicide, but fortunately, he was discovered in time and didn't die.\"\n\nZhou Ze stuck out his tongue and licked his lips.\n\n\"What were you about to say?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"To tell you to consider sending more personnel to protect the two people who were arrested;\n\nHmm,\n\nIt's meaningless now.\"",

    "content": "Back at the police station, Mr. Zhou, who generally avoids getting involved, found himself unable to ignore matters within his jurisdiction any longer.\n\nIf the hanging of the yellow-haired youth and the drowning of another could be attributed to genuine psychological breakdowns or murder, what about the two currently held at the station? Surely these tomb-robbing scoundrels couldn't have connections reaching the heavens, perhaps a powerful protector capable of silencing witnesses even within the police department? This wasn't some police-gangster drama.\n\nThe old Taoist, flustered, trailed behind Zhou Ze. After a cursory examination of the brother who had bitten off his own tongue, the Taoist's face grew paler. He was scared. While it seemed unbelievable that someone who had encountered ghosts would be frightened by such a scene, it was perfectly understandable. Biting off one's tongue required severing it completely. Even a minor accidental bite could cause a normal person pain for half a day; imagine the horror of a clean bite! Death would result from either exsanguination or suffocation due to the severed tongue obstructing the airway. Excessive bleeding could also lead to insufficient oxygen intake. In any case, it was a bold and agonizing way to die. The most absurd part was these petty tomb robbers, hardly warriors sacrificing themselves for some noble cause, suddenly exhibiting such \"rather die than be disgraced\" defiance in their cells. Was it plausible?\n\n\"Arrange for me to see the remaining one,\" Zhou Ze instructed Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nZhang Yanfeng hesitated, but complied. Though reluctant to admit it, he understood that Zhou Ze might be the key to breaking the stalemate. This case was gradually slipping beyond human control.\n\nTwo hours later, as dawn broke, Zhou Ze finally met the young man in a room adjacent to the infirmary. The young man's gaze was unfocused, his body occasionally twitching. Even with the \"culprit\" sitting right in front of him, he acted as if he saw nothing. Zhang Yanfeng dismissed the other officers, but stayed himself.\n\n\"Can he still speak?\" The old Taoist waved his hand in front of the young man. Still no reaction, not even a flicker of his eyes.\n\n\"Is he crazy?\" Zhang Yanfeng nodded. \"He's trending that way.\" As a seasoned detective, Zhang Yanfeng had encountered many hardened criminals who feigned mental illness, epilepsy, or various other ailments to evade justice. However, he couldn't definitively label the man before him as faking. The initial interrogation had targeted him precisely because they assumed he was young and inexperienced, aiming to break through there first.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gently patted the young man's cheek. No response. He had breath, a heartbeat, body temperature, yet he seemed completely cut off from the outside world, trapped in a profound state of self-imposed isolation. At this point, forget interrogation; even beating him with a chair wouldn't elicit a cry of pain.\n\n\"What do we do?\" Zhang Yanfeng looked at Zhou Ze. \"The department has already called in a psychological consultant.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"It's useless. This isn't a purely psychological issue.\"\n\n\"Where did he attempt to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"In the detention center. While eating, he tried to swallow a metal ornament from his clothes.\"\n\n\"Take me to the detention center.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\n...\n\nThe police detention center was no stranger to Mr. Zhou. He had spent a night there before, arrested by Zhang Yanfeng himself. It was that night that the iron chain appeared on his leg, triggering the subsequent chain of events. Today, the detention center was sparsely populated, and the young man was held in a solitary confinement cell, separate from the others.\n\nZhang Yanfeng signaled the duty officer to open the door. Zhou Ze didn't rush in, instead peering through the bars. In the corner, the young man crouched, knees hugged to his chest, trembling. He looked like a startled quail, living in perpetual fear.\n\nThe cell door opened, and Zhou Ze entered, crouching directly before the young man. His fingernails slowly extended a little, and he waved them in front of the man. The young man's vacant stare refocused, and his trembling intensified. All spectral entities possessed an innate fear of Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\n\"Speak. Who wanted you dead?\"\n\nThe old Taoist and Zhang Yanfeng exchanged a bewildered glance. However, the old Taoist, seasoned in such matters, quickly retrieved his ox tears and applied them to his eyes. With them, he felt a sense of innate superiority. He squatted beside Zhou Ze with a small notebook, appearing to diligently take notes. He even glanced up at Zhang Yanfeng from time to time, smugly thinking, \"You can't see; you can't see.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nudged the old Taoist and, spreading his hands, indicated for him to share the substance. The old Taoist shook his head. \"No. If I share it with you, I lose my sense of superiority. Besides, do you think ox tears are cheap?\"\n\n\"Officer Zhang, leave this to me,\" Zhou Ze said, looking back at Zhang Yanfeng. \"Some things, once seen, are hard to forget.\" From his heart, Zhou Ze wanted Zhang Yanfeng to remain a good police officer, serving the people. Furthermore, in supernatural matters, witnessing a ghost firsthand could be a terrifying blow, even a destructive one, to one's perception of the world and established values. It was unnecessary.\n\nZhang Yanfeng hesitated, then turned and left, waiting outside. About fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze and the old Taoist emerged. Zhang Yanfeng looked at Zhou Ze, then at the notebook in the old Taoist's hand, and asked, \"Can I see this?\"\n\n\"Arrange a car. We're going to the woods,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\n...\n\nWest Woods, situated near a riverbank, was one of the few undeveloped areas within Tongcheng's jurisdiction, with several villages and towns nearby. Zhang Yanfeng, now in plain clothes, drove. He insisted on accompanying them.\n\nAfter getting out of the car, Zhou Ze immediately frowned. The old Taoist also frowned, appearing to find the situation difficult and serious.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"Such heavy resentment!\" the old Taoist replied gravely.\n\n\"What?\" Zhang Yanfeng exclaimed.\n\n\"It's so stinky.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand in front of his nose. A short distance away, on the riverbank, a large pile of garbage emitted a foul odor in the summer heat. Debris from upstream would get caught here, accumulating into a small garbage mountain.\n\n... The old Taoist.\n\n... Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nZhou Ze led the way into the woods. Due to recent heavy rains, the ground was muddy. Zhang Yanfeng offered to guide them, stating that while they hadn't found the tomb, he could at least lead them to the spot the tomb robbers had identified during the day. Zhou Ze declined. He had already asked what he needed to ask. As the saying goes, \"The dying speak words of truth.\" If a ghost dared to harbor any ulterior motives when facing a ghost messenger, it would deserve a medal for bravery. The reason for not letting Zhang Yanfeng lead was that the young man was walking ahead of Zhou Ze. This was his residual spirit, but not all of it. There was a popular saying for extreme shock: \"His soul was scared out of him.\" In reality, this young man was precisely in this state. He hadn't succeeded in his suicide attempt, but a part of his soul had indeed been scared out of his body, leading to his catatonic state. Folktales often spoke of the soul leaving the body, and the legend of Tieguai Li was based on this principle, though with a distinction between \"active\" and \"passive\" departure.\n\n\"Boss, they didn't find it before,\" the old Taoist, still wearing his ox tears, said as he approached. During the day, the young man had led them, but the police had searched for the entire afternoon and half the night without success.\n\n\"Searching as a living person is different from searching as a ghost,\" Zhou Ze explained. A person's eyes are their window to the world, but they can also be easily deceived. It's different when one dies and becomes a spirit. You can't fool a ghost, can you? This is another common saying, but in reality, ghosts are not so easily fooled.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes of walking, quite a distance, Mr. Zhou felt a twinge of annoyance. His leather shoes were already covered in mud, which made him uncomfortable. Fortunately, the young man ahead stopped, remaining stationary.\n\n\"We're here?\" Zhou Ze asked. The young man nodded.\n\nZhang Yanfeng, walking alone behind them, felt like an outsider. Hearing Zhou Ze's question, he immediately said, \"This wasn't the place during the day. It's much further.\" Zhou Ze raised his hand, signaling Zhang to be quiet. Zhang felt a bit stifled.\n\n\"Old Taoist, search around here.\"\n\n\"Got it.\" The old Taoist immediately began searching the surroundings. Zhang Yanfeng, though somewhat bewildered, joined the search. Everyone's attention was focused on the ground, hoping to find the entrance to the tomb. Zhou Ze, disliking the muddy ground and fallen leaves, perfunctorily ambled around the perimeter. As he wandered, Zhou Ze noticed a particular tree that seemed strange. It had a remarkably clean appearance, as if it had been recently groomed, not by any cleaner. The bark was fresher, and the leaves were more verdant, like a nouveau riche standing among the humble villagers, slightly out of place.\n\nZhou Ze approached the tree and, on impulse, gently scraped its bark with his fingernails. He didn't know why he did it or what its purpose was, but he felt compelled. Then, beneath the scraped bark, a human face slowly began to reveal itself...",

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood his ground, unmoving. He wasn't about to be intimidated by such a scene. In fact, Boss Zhou even extended a finger, probing into the mouth of the face.\n\nFlipping its lips open,\n\nrevealed teeth, but not just teeth.\n\nIt was packed solid with dirt and sand.\n\nThis was a face completely filled with mud and sand, exquisite and stern, its expression frozen, like a \"sculptural artwork\" standing there.\n\n\"Holy hell!\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest merely glanced towards Boss, saw the face in the tree bark, and shivered. Seeing the boss actually fiddling with the face's mouth with his finger,\n\nthe old Daoist shivered again.\n\nZhang Yanfeng took a deep breath and walked over, suppressing his discomfort, saying, \"This is one of the people who died in the tomb chamber at the beginning.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied,\n\nnodding.\n\nThings were getting serious.\n\nDespite Boss Zhou's seemingly nonchalant action of probing into the mouth, that was merely because Zhou Ze's mind had briefly gone blank and he hadn't thought things through.\n\nNow, he was thinking them through,\n\nand the implications were terrifying.\n\nThe little loli initially chose to treat Zhou Ze as a sucker to be \"used and discarded\" because she believed Zhou Ze was sensible.\n\nIn reality, if not for the upheaval that night in Rongcheng, Zhou Ze wouldn't have had the chance to turn the tables.\n\nBecause of this, upon seeing this scene, Zhou Ze began to understand that this matter was beyond even his capabilities to handle.\n\nXu Qinglang had once specifically found some old books of strange tales for Zhou Ze, including famous ones like \"Jishui Ji\" (Collected Records of Seeking the Supernatural), \"Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio,\" and \"Jottings from the Thatched Hut of Close Observation,\" as well as other works by less renowned authors.\n\nZhou Ze recalled a passage, possibly from a Ming Dynasty author:\n\n\"There are those who serve as local earth deities, receiving offerings and incense from a region, protecting its peace and tranquility;\n\nHowever, some earth deities are not officially appointed. Instead, mountain spirits, wild demons, and wandering ghosts are used to fill these roles;\n\nAnyone who dares to disrespect them,\n\nwill have plants used as ropes to tie them up in front of their temples, as a warning to others.\"\n\nIt's unclear what the Ming Dynasty author of this book did for a living, or even their gender, as writing novels in that era was considered a disreputable profession.\n\nJust like who the \"Lanling Xiaoxiao Sheng\" (the pseudonymous author of \"Jin Ping Mei\") was remains unknown.\n\nIt's similar to how the original author of \"Bai Jie's Story,\" if they were to reveal their identity, might face arrest for spreading lewd information.\n\nXu Qinglang had gathered many such books for Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze rarely finished them all, but he finished this one because it was very detailed and had illustrations!\n\nThere were illustrations on almost every page, allowing Boss Zhou to read it like a picture book as a child, without getting tired.\n\nThe original author's \"earth deities\" were the kind of old men that Sun Wukong in \"Journey to the West\" would stomp his foot and summon.\n\nAccording to the original author, earth deities were minor deities not appointed by the Heavenly Court because their positions were too low and not part of the official hierarchy, much like auxiliary police officers today who have low pay, no permanent positions, and still have to do the most difficult grassroots work.\n\nThings are slowly becoming more formalized now. In the past, many local neighborhood watch teams consisted of local ruffians.\n\nAccording to the author's view, earth deities were filled by mountain spirits, wild demons, and wandering ghosts. They could enjoy incense offerings and bless the land with good weather, but their nature wouldn't change. If someone offended them, they would immediately retaliate, kill the person, and use plants as ropes to bind them in front of their temples as a warning to others.\n\nZhou Ze remembered the author's humorous brush-drawn illustration in the book, like children in a preschool program wearing tree costumes to perform.\n\nAnd now,\n\nZhou Ze was seeing the \"real deal.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pointed to another tree at the same level as the current tree.\n\nThe old Daoist priest leaned over and tried to wipe the bark, but he was too gentle. Moreover, the old Daoist had already guessed that something might be revealed, so he was a bit panicked and dared not use much force.\n\nInstead, Zhang Yanfeng stepped forward and began to scrape with his key. Soon, another human face appeared.\n\n\"It's another person,\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng confirmed.\n\nThe two people who died in the tomb chamber had both appeared in the trees.\n\nZhou Ze stuck out his tongue and licked his lips.\n\nCould these six idiots really have been so foolish as to dig up the grave of the Earth God?\n\nThis kind of suicidal act was no different from dancing in the middle of a highway. If you don't die, who will?\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the young ghost, moved him behind him, and then slowly bent down, reaching into the mud on the ground.\n\nBeneath a thin layer of mud was a fragmented stele, its inscription illegible, giving off an extremely ancient feel.\n\n\"Whoosh... Whoosh... Whoosh...\"\n\nIn the woods,\n\nsuddenly a gust of cold wind blew.\n\nThe image of Earth Gods in \"Journey to the West\" was always kind and amiable, but that was because they were facing Sun Wukong.\n\nIt's like how most subordinates are humble and friendly when facing their superiors, but when facing you...\n\nZhou Ze slowly straightened up, no longer digging.\n\n\"What's wrong, is the tomb chamber right below?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"You come back here, don't disturb Boss.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest also sensed that something was wrong and grabbed Zhang Yanfeng, pulling him close to prevent him from moving forward.\n\n\"Earth God, they offended you. They deserved to die. Six people, five are already dead, and the remaining one is also mentally impaired. Can you please cease your wrath?\"\n\nThinking from another perspective,\n\nif your ancestral grave, or rather, your own grave, were dug up, would you want to pick up a knife and fight those grave robbers?\n\nIn America, you can shoot someone for trespassing on your property. Of course, this is an underground dwelling, but this underground dwelling has an owner.\n\nWhat is the current fate of the priest who stole Zhou Ze's ashes?\n\nHe's been made to stand three feet high in a bookstore.\n\nIf it were a vengeful ghost causing trouble, Zhou Ze wouldn't mind solving the vengeful ghost and sending them to hell, offering a complete service. But since it might be the Earth God's wrath, Boss Zhou could only offer a greeting here,\n\n\"Hello, good to you, good to me, let's treat it as neighbors visiting,\"\n\nor perhaps an inter-departmental social event.\n\nLittle loli once said that although Tongcheng was small, it was by no means a place where a few ghost officers could have the final say. Before Madam Bai was sent to hell, she knew of Madam Bai but they always kept to their own affairs.\n\nJust then,\n\nthe old Daoist priest suddenly shivered, as if he had an epileptic seizure, and began to foam at the mouth. The old Daoist, being sharp, knew something was wrong and immediately reached into his pants, pulling out an ancestral charm and sticking it to his forehead.\n\nInstantly,\n\nhis mind cleared, he felt refreshed, and he could climb five flights of stairs without getting tired.\n\n\"Damn it, daring to possess this Daoist priest!\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest had been possessed before. At General Mountain, when facing the commotion of the three sets of warrior armor, it was finally thanks to Cao Ding's heroic spirit possessing the old Daoist that the situation was resolved.\n\nTherefore, the old Daoist had experience and knew what that feeling meant.\n\nThe old Daoist was fine,\n\nbut Zhang Yanfeng, who had been concerned about him, also began to tremble next to him, as if he had Parkinson's, but this trembling only lasted for a short period before disappearing.\n\nZhang Yanfeng remained standing in place.\n\n\"Halt!\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest immediately jumped back, staring vigilantly at Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng seemed a bit bewildered.\n\n\"Huh, you're fine too?\" the old Daoist priest scratched his head, confused.\n\n\"He's a government official, a good police officer, full of righteousness. Although he's not wearing his uniform, the national emblem is always above his head. You can't possess him.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nThis seemed to be an explanation for the old Daoist priest and Zhang Yanfeng,\n\nand also a message for the Earth God.\n\nThe other party likely wanted to possess someone,\n\nto chat,\n\nto talk,\n\nto show off,\n\nto say \"hello, hello\" into a microphone and give a speech or something.\n\nBut the old Daoist priest had the protection of ancestral charms, and Zhang Yanfeng was a people's policeman.\n\nJust as described in that book, the Earth God was merely an insignificant official filled by mountain spirits and wild demons. Fundamentally, someone who could arbitrarily kill and retaliate wouldn't have a good temper. Therefore, it was difficult for him to possess these two people.\n\nBut next,\n\nZhou Ze felt the surrounding wind begin to gather around him as the center,\n\nan unseen aura began to approach Zhou Ze.\n\nThis was,\n\nan attempt to possess him?\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands,\n\noffering no resistance,\n\nand simply said, \"The only one qualified to communicate with you here is me. If you possess me, who will talk to you?\"\n\nAt this moment, the old Daoist priest suddenly pointed at Zhang Yanfeng and said, \"Perhaps he wants to talk to the government.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe wind grew more urgent,\n\nand the aura drew closer.\n\n\"I am a ghost messenger,\" Zhou Ze emphasized.\n\n\"A dog slave of the Underworld! How dare you call yourself an official!\"\n\nAn old, teasing voice came from somewhere. Neither the old Daoist priest nor Zhang Yanfeng heard it, only Zhou Ze himself did.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nthis Earth God was determined to possess him,\n\nand the old Daoist priest's guess might not have been groundless after all.\n\nLocal officials in ancient dynasties would organize the repair of local Earth God temples and City God temples.\n\nThis time, the Earth God's lair was violated by six tomb robbers.\n\nIf he truly wanted to communicate with the government to rebuild his temple so he could receive incense offerings more conveniently, it wouldn't be unreasonable.\n\nAdding to that his tone when evaluating him,\n\nit was clear he didn't regard Zhou Ze, a low-level clerk in the Underworld, as important.\n\nHe didn't intend to chat or have drinks and pleasantries with him.\n\nHe just wanted to borrow a physical body for negotiation.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh,\n\nstill not resisting, because he felt he didn't need to.\n\nHe calmly said,\n\n\"Great Uncle, if you possess me, bad things will happen.\"\n\nBecause inside him,\n\nthere was already a rather ill-tempered fellow residing.\n\nIf he were to be woken up,\n\nthings wouldn't be so pleasant.\n\nBut great uncles can be stubborn when they get old.\n\nClearly, he didn't listen to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt a chill crawl up his spine,\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nIt felt like something was being forcefully shoved in.\n\nHe,\n\nwas being,\n\nforcibly,\n\nentered...",

    "content": "Dead vines,\n\n\n\nOld tree,\n\n\n\n Dime...\n\n\n\nTongcheng is just the size of a palm, but the real estate developers are actually the best at long-term development. They are still building a pavilion in the snail shell, and they have created a picture of \"Little Bridge Flowing Water House\" under the foot of the military mountain.\n\n\n\nThis is a semi-official hospital with a good location and beautiful scenery. The most important thing is still peaceful.\n\n\n\nVisitors from Langshan will not come far away, and there are no hospitals and shopping malls nearby. It is a rare opportunity to take a tranquil situation in the city.\n\n\n\nWang Fu stopped the work in the office. For him, he had been in the \"process\" of coming out of the orphanage to fight.\n\n\n\nNow, the changes in the family's affairs have forced him to re-distinguish the primary and secondary\n\n\n\nFor many people, family affairs are a synonym. Only with family can you have a business, and only with business can you have a family. But this feeling is like the old farmer in ancient times that the emperor could eat ten meat buns for breakfast. Only when you really reach that level can you not get cold.\n\n\n\nWang Hua's wife sat alone in a corner of the garden, while Wang Hua was having sex in the room opposite.\n\n\n\nOld rules,\n\n\n\nNo matter how well other dishes are cooked, it is a helping hand. Only a large pot of cooked meat soup is the real protagonist on this family table.\n\n\n\nWang Fu’s technique of making meat soup is chewy. The old Taoist used to drink a lot of it at Wang Fu’s house.\n\n\n\nBoss Zhou's body shirt under his lower body,\n\n\n\nEven my soup was taken to drink with the old Taoist.\n\n\n\nLet the old Taoist feel the concern from the leader like the spring wind blowing his face\n\n\n\nWhen cooking, a man dressed as a doctor left and chatted with Wang Fu respectfully. Wang Fu smiled, washed his hands, and went to the living room with him to have a detailed chat.\n\n\n\nThe other party is a doctor in this hospital. He is responsible for the psychological sorting of the farmers here. He is also a little famous in the industry, but he dare not take big shots in front of Wang Fu.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is said that it is a flag to discuss his wife's condition with Wang Fushang, it actually means to communicate and discuss with each other. In this regard, Wang Fushang is a big shot.\n\n\n\nIf it weren't for the family's drag, Wang Hua could have tried to go to Shanghai to seek greater development.\n\n\n\nWang Qi's wife continued to sit there wearing white clothes, her eyes a little resentful, like a lonely little girl, no one to play with her, which looked a little bored, and she herself didn't know what to do\n\n\n\nOnly time can be pinched,\n\n\n\nThinking about when I can eat evening meals,\n\n\n\nCan drink the soup you dream of every day\n\n\n\nAnd at this time,\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli walked out of the nearby flowerbed, and she walked calmly to her \"mother\"\n\n\n\n\"Ruirui, you're here to see your mother.\"\n\n\n\nWang Hua's wife reached out and touched her daughter's head. She had forgotten that day when she stabbed her husband with a knife and her daughter directly grabbed the knife's edge.When she was normal, she was actually really normal and could go out for hair.\n\n\n\nYou can also pick up your daughter to and from school.\n\n\n\nSo normal that he doesn't look like a patient at all\n\n\n\nBut when she is abnormal, if Wang Hui had not been responsible for supervising her and guiding her, she might have become a terrifying ogre that killed people.\n\n\n\nSometimes, even Xiao Luoli felt that her father loved her mother a little too much. She loved her a little too much.\n\n\n\n\"The husband and wife are the same as Lin Feng, and they are difficult to fly each other.\" It's a bit too much, but with her father's status and economic conditions, she can still take care of her mother without complaints and regrets. Even as a family member, Xiao Luli felt it was a bit difficult to understand.\n\n\n\n\"You're a little better\"\n\n\n\n\"What's better? My mother, I'm not sick. It's your father who insisted that he's going to come here to take care of it for a while. It's not easy for your father. It's too hard to work. I haven't had a good rest in the past few years. It's time to take a break.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli sat down beside her mother.\n\n\n\nShe couldn't snuggle up to her mother.\n\n\n\nIn this home, Wang Fu was the one who touched her the most. That man seemed to have a clear understanding of everything. He treated himself as a daughter, whether he was sleeping or waking up.\n\n\n\nThis is very touching,\n\n\n\nAt the same time,\n\n\n\nThis is also very scary\n\n\n\nThis is also natural. At that time, Wang Fu's hair circumference that he had not seen for many years could be distinguished through some details.\n\n\n\nAs for the changes in the daughter she lives with day and night,\n\n\n\nNaturally, it becomes more sensitive\n\n\n\n  As middle-aged, it is difficult to be confused. It is said that it is Wang Fu. His family, his wife and daughter have long become unknown messes on the ship. There are not many more, and there are not many less. There are not many more, and there are not many less. He can't do anything. He had already gone to the rooftop and shouted \"The Unfairness of Heaven\" and then jumped down.\n\n\n\nA furry white fox came out from under Wang Fu's wife's foot and jumped onto Xiao Luli's leg\n\n\n\n\"This cat is so cute. I have seen her frequently recently, but your dad always said I missed it. He has never seen this cat.\n\n\n\nBut I know,\n\n\n\nShe has been with me and sleeping with me while she is sleeping.\"\n\n\n\nWang Hua's wife pointed to the white fox and said\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli reached out to touch the white fox head.\n\n\n\nThis white fox came to the bookstore to look for Zhou Ze, but Zhou Ze was not there at that time, so Xiao Fuli intercepted him.\n\n\n\nAlthough the white fox has a broken tail and its foundation is damaged. The previous two hundred years of hard work is almost done by Dongliu, she is actually a great monster who can be called by Xiaohu. The so-called centipede dead without being staggered is her.\n\n\n\n  Accompanies a mentally ill patient, and even in one aspect, she has the ability to make people feel at ease and help with treatment\n\n\n\nThe white fox stuck out his tongue and licked Xiao Luli's palm.\n\n\n\n\"Mom, I'm going to do work.\"\n\n\n\n\"Go ahead, be tight when doing work\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli left with the white fox. She didn't go to see Wang Fu, nor did she want to see Wang Fu, and she could even say that she was......Don't dare to go\n\n\n\nShe is a body of Lu Li and a ladylike soul\n\n\n\n  Uploader is in a hot mood. As a big female entrepreneur, she has always been wearing single clothes, and she doesn’t like many men.\n\n\n\n  so,\n\n\n\n  It’s a bit difficult for her to feel a man like Wang Fu.\n\n\n\nIt was from him that he had almost forgotten his father's love\n\n\n\nStill, the charming characteristics of this man himself are attracting her\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli doesn't know, and doesn't want to know\n\n\n\nBut sometimes when she looked at the scene where he was drinking bitter tea and thinking about the case behind the desk, she felt a little intoxicated.\n\n\n\n  Father\n\n\n\n  hehe\n\n\n\nGhost father\n\n\n\n  hehe\n\n\n\n\"Your family ethics is very unfamiliar.\"\n\n\n\nThe fox can already speak in a low voice. In this case, some of the supplements that Xiao Luli gave her were not completely useless. It is precisely because of these supplements that she is willing to stay here to accompany her mother to help her heal her.\n\n\n\n\"I want you to come, not for you to see this.\" Xiao Luoli was a little unhappy\n\n\n\n\"Haha, this man really loves this woman,\" said the white fox\n\n\n\n  \"I know\"\n\n\n\n\"What is the love in the world...\" The white fox was a little depressed, \"I was a little intoxicated by seeing it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sweet love\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not a trait. If you really want to be good for him, it's better to help and solve his debts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Puff\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli's tongue quickly stretched out and wrapped the fox. The fox was strangled tightly and could be strangled to death at any time.\n\n\n\n\"What I said... is not right...............................................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\"She... died...he...so...relieves...\"\n\n\n\n\"If I say it again, I don't mind killing a great immortal by hand.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli warned\n\n\n\nAfter saying that, the tongue was retracted and the white fox landed on the ground again\n\n\n\n\"Or, let me replace her and make me her, or\n\n\n\nTrust me, I can make your father feel so comfortable that he is dying of ecstasy.”\n\n\n\nXiao Luli shook her head\n\n\n\n\"You don't believe it\"\n\n \n\nHehe,\n\n\n\n  man,\n\n\n\nFor the \"man\",\n\n\n\nWhite fox is rich in experience\n\n\n\n\"If he wants to let her die, there are a thousand ways to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\"He has moral constraints\"\n\n\n\n\"He has no morality\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli turned around, looked at the woman who was still sitting there in a daze, and continued, \"Do you know when she was mentally ill?\"\n\n\n\n  \"have no idea\"\n\n\n\n\"She was with him, and I was not there at that time. He died at that time, just a graduate student who came out of school, and his family background was still the orphanage.\n\n\n\nShe didn't bother him. As a classmate, she continued with him and was still suffering from opposition and pressure from her family.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have seen more of this kind of code, but I have seen more of it, and I have been promoted and lost money to my wife.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli smiled,\n\n\n\n\"He loved eating meat since he was a child. At that time, the conditions were not good. He was not so easy to eat meat now. Moreover, because he was born in an orphanage, he had a desire for meat that ordinary people could not understand.\n\n\n\nSo, at that time, she often bought meat for him and cooked it. She liked to make meat for him, and he also ate it very happily.\n\n\n\nBecause the conditions were not good at that time, she would ride to a very far place every time to buy cheap and fresh meat.”\n\n\n\n\"Really oily\"\n\n\n\n\"And then, that time, something happened and she met a hooligan.\"\n\n\n\nThe white fox did not insert voiceover this time.\n\n\n\nBecause she felt that she would insert a voiceover again, she would really become a voiceover in the future.\n\n\n\n\"She was insulted, and was a group of hooligans, and then she lost her mind. He searched hard, and finally found her. She hid next to a garbage dump, holding her with a stinky pork that had long been stinky, and she was still unwilling to let go.\"\n\n\n\n\"Huh…………”\n\n\n\nThe white fox stuck out his tongue\n\n\n\n\"The mental memory is what was left at that time. She kept trying to forget the memory of that day, but she kept remembering that he bought meat. Although he was always protecting her and giving her treatment, there were some things that could not be solved by healing.\"\n\n\n\nLittle Li looked at the white fox and reached out to touch her Corgi-like buttocks\n\n\n\nNo tail,\n\n\n\nVery interesting\n\n\n\n\"Then this man is quite conscientious.\"\n\n\n\n\"There's one more thing\"\n\n\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\n\n\"After that time, she became pregnant. For her condition, he didn't let her abort the child.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not necessarily...\"\n\n\n\n\"He is...dead sperm\"",

    "content": "A chilling sensation entered his body,\n\nIt felt full,\n\nWith a slight tearing pain.\n\nAt first, it was a bit dry, but then it slowly became smooth.\n\nAnd after the coldness, it was replaced by a warm dampness.\n\nBoss Zhou had only ever been possessed by Xu Le in his life; no one else had forcibly possessed him. As for the one inside his own body, that was an internal conflict among the people.\n\nEvery time that one emerged, it was because Boss Zhou deliberately ceded authority; the nature of it was different.\n\nThis time, the Land Deity forcibly possessed him, and Boss Zhou opened the gates wide.\n\nYou want to come in, right?\n\nFine,\n\nCome on in.\n\nThis is your own doing,\n\nDon't blame me.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to develop good neighborly and friendly cooperative relations between the local underworld of Tongcheng and the Heavenly Court.\n\nPeaceful development for everyone.\n\nYou be your local earth god, enjoying your incense offerings, and I'll be my ghost messenger, catching ghosts and making my achievements.\n\nNow,\n\nSince you don't treat me as an official,\n\nThen I don't need to be polite to you.\n\nZhou Xianyu, like a flea with too many to care about being bitten, had already captured several Great Immortals of the Northeast and imprisoned them in the Yin-Yang Register, and they still couldn't get out. He had done plenty of suicidal things before.\n\nAs usual, it didn't stop him from drinking coffee, reading the newspaper, and sunbathing in the morning.\n\n\"Heh, you're from the government, aren't you?\"\n\nZhou Ze said, pointing at Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nZhang Yanfeng was taken aback.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's voice carried an aged and mischievous tone; it wasn't Zhou Ze's voice at all.\n\n\"Yes, he is. Esteemed Sir, whatever your demands, just state them. We can discuss them; there's nothing that can't be discussed, right?\n\nYou have to believe the govern...ment; all problems can be solved through dialogue and communication.\"\n\nSeeing Zhang Yanfeng flustered, the old Taoist priest immediately stepped up to perform.\n\n\"Your talismans... have a problem.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Taoist priest and said.\n\n\"Hey, they have a problem, they have a problem.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest nodded and bowed repeatedly.\n\nHe was unclear about the basis of Zhou Ze's confidence.\n\nHe now assumed the boss had been affected and that it was more important to preserve his own life by seeking a compromise.\n\n\"Your talism...\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nHe still looked at Zhang Yanfeng and said, \"You're the local constable, aren't you?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"My temple collapsed, so...\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze's voice suddenly changed.\n\n\"What... are you doing...\"\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist priest.\n\n\"...\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nNext,\n\nIt entered a stage of dumbfounded disbelief for the two onlookers, the old Taoist priest and Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThose who didn't understand\n\nMight have thought Boss Zhou was idly showing off his ventriloquism here.\n\nThe Qing Dynasty scholar Lin Sihuan's \"Ventriloquism\" article once concluded the noisy scene with, \"Suddenly, he rapped his ruler once, and all sounds ceased. They removed the screen and looked; it was just one person, one table, one chair, one fan, and one ruler.\"\n\n\"Why is there another one in here?\"\n\nThe Land Deity was a bit confused.\n\nWhat was going on?\n\n\"I... am asking you.\"\n\nIt was the voice of that other entity,\n\nCarrying extreme dissatisfaction and impatience.\n\nHe was questioning Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Who are you, you scoundrel, to dare speak so outrageously before this deity!\n\nThis deity is here, borrowing this mortal body. How dare you all be so presumptuous!\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked the old Taoist priest.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was beginning to understand. He secretly tugged at Zhang Yanfeng's sleeve from behind, signaling him to retreat slowly with him.\n\nNext,\n\nIt would be a fight between deities.\n\nAs mortals,\n\nIt was best to retreat first.\n\n\"What... junk... are you bringing... inside?\"\n\nIt was the inquiry from that other entity,\n\nHe was living quite comfortably inside and was questioning Zhou Ze why he was bringing in any random stray.\n\nWhere did that put him?\n\n\"Presumptuous!\"\n\nThe Land Deity rebuked.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze's body began to shrivel slowly.\n\nA layer of greenish luster began to rise from beneath his flesh and blood, carrying an intoxicating mystique.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nZhou Ze's body began to stoop slightly.\n\nHis arms hung down naturally, swaying gently by his knees. His long fingernails almost touched the ground, constantly scraping against the mud below.\n\nIn the depths of those eyes, a dark luster, like the oppressive calm before a thunderstorm, was intensifying.\n\nThe fangs at the corners of his mouth,\n\nSlowly protruded,\n\nLike a demon's predatory gaze.\n\n\"Say... that again?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at himself with his finger.\n\n\"Uh... you... who are you!!!\n\nDamn it, who exactly are you!!!\"\n\nThe Land Deity began to scream.\n\n\"Die... for me!\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grasped a spot in front of his brow. The contact between his fingernails made a metallic clanging sound.\n\nThen,\n\nA ball of greenish-blue light was forcibly pulled out from Zhou Ze's brow.\n\n\"Who are you, you demon, who are you!\"\n\nZhou Ze remained silent,\n\nContinuing to pull him out.\n\n\"This deity is a local earth god, appointed by the Heavenly Court, to educate and nurture the local populace. How dare you disrespect me!\n\nYou cannot disrespect me!\n\nPlease,\n\nDon't disrespect me!\n\nPlease don't do this to me!\"\n\nThe ball of green light was slowly being pulled out.\n\nZhou Ze's dark eyes stared at it,\n\nAt the corner of his mouth,\n\nA bit of saliva seemed to be secreting,\n\nSlowly dripping down his sharp fangs.\n\nHe was salivating.\n\n\"Land Deity... tastes good...\"\n\n\"...\" Land Deity.\n\n\"Ding!\"\n\nA golden light suddenly shot out, hitting Zhou Ze directly on the forehead.\n\nZhou Ze's body swayed slightly, then became still, as if struck by a paralyzing spell.\n\nA wooden plaque appeared on Zhou Ze's forehead. It was small, narrow, and looked very worn, indicating that the local people's incense offerings to him had long been insufficient.\n\nNo wonder this Land Deity had such a bad temper.\n\nNot only were the incense offerings dwindling,\n\nBut there were also several scoundrels trying to dig up his grave.\n\nIt was enough to drive him mad!\n\nTherefore, he was eager to come out, even if it meant breaking the rules, he wanted to get his temple rebuilt. He wasn't without incense offerings; there were indeed quite a few Earth God temples built throughout Tongcheng, but they were all unofficial temples, and the incense offerings there had long since gone elsewhere.\n\nIn the past few years, there were also local minor deities like the Green-robed Lady and Madam Bai, whose names were obscure, competing with him for incense offerings, making life even more difficult for this legitimate Earth God.\n\nBecause of this, he was not afraid of breaking taboos.\n\nBut who would have thought,\n\nThat a single misstep,\n\nWould lead him to step directly on a landmine!\n\nThe green light circle took the opportunity to escape Zhou Ze's grasp and floated in mid-air, looking coldly at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"This is my temple plaque, suppressing all evil. No matter what you are, unless you are the reincarnation of Ying Gou or Hou Qing, I can still suppress you firmly!\n\nWith your merit, this deity will also gain another segment of merit, and the deficits of these years can be made up!\"\n\nThe Land Deity thought gleefully.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nThe old Taoist priest, who was \"secretly observing,\" nervously removed the talisman from his forehead,\n\nReady for battle at any moment.\n\nZhang Yanfeng was somewhat clueless; he didn't even know if he should draw his gun at this moment.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, this Taoist will protect you. Five hundred years ago, I was on Mount Huaguo...\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old Taoist priest realized he was too nervous and had rambled, so he immediately stopped talking.\n\nHowever,\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nA very crisp sound came from the wooden plaque on Zhou Ze's forehead:\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe wooden plaque shattered,\n\nAnd began to crackle outwards.\n\nZhou Ze, who had been motionless, reached out and brushed away the wood chips from his forehead.\n\nHe looked at the green light that the Land Deity had transformed into with a very strange gaze.\n\n\"You are very... good...\"\n\nThe Land Deity became a little flustered.\n\nHis plaque, even though it had become less effective due to the lack of incense offerings in recent years, shouldn't have been this ineffective.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze's next sentence,\n\nMade the Land Deity truly panic.\n\n\"You actually... recognized... me...\"\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThe Land Deity instantly turned into a beam of light,\n\nShot into the ground ahead,\n\nAnd fled back into its own grave, trembling.\n\nThe outside world was too terrifying,\n\nIt dared not come out again.\n\nZhou Ze continued to rub the area on his brow.\n\nHonestly,\n\nIt hurt a bit,\n\nEspecially the power of merit and faith on it, which made him feel a bit disgusted.\n\nHowever, he didn't blame Zhou Ze for waking him up in this place. In fact, at this moment, he felt that Zhou Ze waking him up was a very correct choice.\n\nThe Land Deity, nourished by local incense offerings, was barely considered a demigod.\n\nThe taste,\n\nShould be good.\n\nHe took a few steps forward, reached out, and dug into the soil layer. After digging several times, he became impatient and slowly straightened up again.\n\n\"What is he doing?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng asked the old Taoist priest.\n\nThe old Taoist priest seemed to see through everything and snorted, \"Truly inherited, the lazy disease.\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept towards the old Taoist priest.\n\n\"Your loyal old Taoist has come online!!!\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest immediately jumped out. Without a word, he squatted down in front of Zhou Ze and began to dig the ground for him.\n\nHe knew what Zhou Ze wanted to do and understood what he should do at this moment.\n\nYou ask if the old Taoist priest suffered?\n\nNot at all!\n\nDamn it,\n\nAlthough he had served two ghost bosses before,\n\nEven the two ghost bosses combined were not as substantial as a single hair on the thigh of the one before him!\n\nThe old Taoist priest even thought,\n\nOld Boss,\n\nGive me a bite,\n\nAnd let me become a high-level zombie!\n\nLike Yingying, with intelligence, but preferably a hard one!\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nZhou Ze directly swept his hand.\n\nThe old Taoist priest felt a great force hit him,\n\nAnd he was sent flying backward, landing on the ground and rolling a few times, his mouth full of mud.\n\nSo wronged,\n\nYou don't bite me,\n\nAnd you hit me.\n\n\"Too slow...\"\n\nZhou Ze said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Shall I call an excavator for you?\" the old Taoist priest continued to ask obsequiously, taking out his phone at the same time.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\nInstead, he slowly spread his hands apart,\n\nAnd his mouth began to open.\n\nFrom his throat,\n\nEmerged a hissing roar,\n\nCarrying a terrifying sense of oppression and suffocation.\n\nThe old Taoist priest and Zhang Yanfeng had to cover their ears, but even so, they felt their bodies shake, and their nostrils almost bled.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nThe two corpses, made into sculptures within the two trees, suddenly opened their eyes.\n\nThe bark began to peel off,\n\nThen,\n\nThe entire trees began to shake.\n\nFinally,\n\nWith a \"crack,\"\n\nThe two trees snapped together.\n\nThe two walking corpses swayed and slowly walked up to Zhou Ze, their mouths agape, and continued to roar along.\n\n\"You died in life... because... you were digging for him... so... after death... I'll let you... continue... digging!\"\n\nThe two walking corpses immediately lunged forward,\n\nAnd began to dig frantically with their bare arms,\n\nAt an astonishing speed.",

    "content": "\"Dr. Wang, thank you for your guidance. Hearing your words is more valuable than reading ten years' worth of books. I still have a long way to go in psychological counseling, and I hope to catch up to your footsteps soon.\"\n\nThe young psychiatrist at the sanatorium bowed sincerely to Wang Ke.\n\nThis was genuine admiration from the heart.\n\nBecause just now, Wang Ke not only answered several long-standing confusions of his, but also copied a copy of his classic cases and patient analysis data from the past few years for him.\n\nIn every industry, regardless of nationality, there's a tradition of hoarding knowledge. But Wang Ke's open attitude in nurturing a junior truly touched and conquered him.\n\n\"You're too kind, Dr. Zhao. If there are opportunities in the future, we can exchange more. After all, as you can see, I anticipate staying here for a long time.\"\n\n\"It's my honor. Thank you.\"\n\nDr. Zhao bowed again and then left.\n\nWang Ke took a deep breath, sat back in his chair, coughed a few times, then took out his cigar box, preparing to light one.\n\nHe could make anyone feel as if they were in a spring breeze; this was his work habit and his life philosophy.\n\nBefore he could pick up the cigar, his phone buzzed with a message. It was a text from an unsaved number, containing only three words:\n\n\"I'm here.\"\n\nWang Ke replied with two words:\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nSoon, the door was pushed open. The sanatorium's internal security system was very strict. The fact that the person could enter directly indicated that their identity was extraordinary.\n\nThe person wore a black jacket, their figure slightly stooped. As they entered, they habitually closed the door, then sat down on the sofa of their own accord, pouring themselves some tea.\n\nThis was a person nearing fifty. You couldn't call him an old man, because fifty is not considered old;\n\nYou also couldn't call him a middle-aged man, because he no longer fit that description.\n\nIn short,\n\nThis was a very awkward age,\n\nSo awkward that the half-black, half-white hair on his head seemed to tell the whole story.\n\n\"Cough, cough...\"\n\nThe person coughed heavily twice, took out a medicine bottle from his pocket, poured out two capsules, and took them with water. He tilted his head back, and with two \"gulp, gulp\" sounds, he lowered his head heavily, gasping for breath.\n\n\"I'm dying.\"\n\nThe person's voice was a bit hoarse, but this hoarseness didn't convey weakness. Instead, it was like a dormant tiger; anyone who dared to look down on him would suffer a backlash.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nWang Ke nodded, putting down his cigar. He knew that the man in front of him couldn't tolerate the smell of smoke right now if he wanted to live a few more days.\n\nThe man looked up, glanced at the cigar, split his dry lips, and licked them with his tongue, looking quite covetous. But he still yawned, lowered his head again, spread his hands, and looked at the calluses on his palms.\n\nHe said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Two years ago, I asked you if you needed me to take action, and you said to wait. Do you know how I felt then?\"\n\n\"Like you wanted to kill me.\"\n\nWang Ke answered calmly.\n\nThe elder smiled faintly, a smile of self-satisfaction. \"My children, including my private doctor, all say that my surviving to this day is a minor medical miracle.\n\nBut they don't know why.\"\n\n\"So, you have me to thank.\"\n\n\"Thank me?\"\n\nThe man suddenly raised his head, his eyes bloodshot. He growled hoarsely, \"Thank you for making me suffer for two more years?\n\nTwo years ago, when I was diagnosed and the doctor gave me three months, I called you frantically, wanting to repay the favor I owed you, but you refused, saying to wait!\n\nIt was you\n\nWho made me unwilling to leave without repaying the favor,\n\nIt was you\n\nWho made me endure two years of suffering from illness for nothing!\n\nI thank you,\n\nI truly thank you!\"\n\n\"Two years ago, it really wasn't suitable,\" Wang Ke replied.\n\n\"You chickened out.\"\n\n\"Yes, I chickened out. Two years ago, those two people had just been released from prison. If they had suddenly died, I would have been easily implicated.\n\nI couldn't afford any risk of accidents,\n\nAnd I couldn't allow any risk that could lead to accidents!\"\n\n\"Heh, I know. A child who came from an orphanage, it's not easy to have struggled to where you are today. So, you can even endure this kind of revenge, fearing you'll lose everything you possess.\n\nDo you know,\n\nWith my fifty years of life experience, I can tell you that the more you fear losing something, the more easily you lose it. Moreover, living a life like that is truly too tiring and not worth it.\"\n\n\"You're wrong. It's not that I can't bear to part with money or status.\"\n\nWang Ke shook his head.\n\n\"True. If you went to Shanghai or to other institutions, your development would probably be better. Cough, cough, cough... So, what is it that you can't bear to part with?\"\n\n\"My wife, and also, my daughter.\"\n\n\"That bastard counts too?\"\n\nWang Ke's eyes suddenly widened, a deep glint appearing in them.\n\n\"You rarely get angry,\" the man chuckled hoarsely again. \"It seems this isn't a fake loving father. How do you hypnotize yourself into treating a child who isn't your own as your biological daughter?\"\n\n\"She is my Wang Ke's daughter.\n\nNo matter if\n\nShe\n\nIs human,\n\nOr a ghost!\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, she's your daughter, your precious daughter.\"\n\nThe man stood up, gritting his teeth.\n\n\"My teeth are getting loose, this tiger. I'm really afraid that when you ask me to repay the favor, my teeth won't be strong enough to bite anyone to death.\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nThe man took out a handgun and waved it in front of Wang Ke, saying,\n\n\"When you contacted me, I took this out. You know what using a gun means in this country.\"\n\nWang Ke looked at the man, his fingers gently tapping on the tabletop. \"When I contacted you, I didn't know your situation. It wasn't until I met you recently that I...\"\n\n\"No need for nonsense. The favor I owe you is the favor I owe you. As long as I have a breath left, I should repay it!\n\nIt's only right and proper,\n\nThis is what I believe in my entire life.\n\nEven if I know that firing this gun might ruin half of my life's accumulation and the accumulation my children hope I leave for them, I still won't regret it.\"\n\nWang Ke shrugged. His persuasion was merely a gesture, not a genuine attempt to convince.\n\n\"It's been two years. If those two people die now, it should be fine. At least, it won't attract too much attention. Moreover, if an investigation occurs, I can take all the blame, and it won't fall on you.\"\n\nThe man put the gun back on the coffee table and sat back down on the sofa. Standing for a while made him feel tired.\n\n\"The doctor told me to use a cane, but I can't use that thing. When I was young, I told the brothers around me, pointing at those old men using canes, that if the day came when I had to walk with a cane, I'd rather shove a gun into my mouth and pull the trigger myself.\"\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\"But when the time came, I suddenly felt like I was losing out.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nThe man reached out and touched the muzzle of the gun on the coffee table. \"I can't use it anymore.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the two people it was meant to kill are already dead.\"\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\nWang Ke slowly stood up.\n\n\"You had someone kill them?\"\n\n\"Heh...\"\n\nThe man spread his legs and laughed. \"I had someone investigate. After these two were released from prison, they quickly got back together. They even roped in a few more people and went to the wilderness to dig up graves.\n\nAs it turned out, they were unlucky. Those two died inside.\n\nThe police\n\nAre investigating this matter.\n\nIf I didn't know you, I would have thought you looked down on this sick tiger and paid someone to settle the score for you with a black-on-black incident.\"\n\n\"I didn't.\"\n\n\"I know you didn't, because you would have had them die more cleanly. Back then, I also thought about helping you catch them and hand them over for you to deal with. Some anger needs to be released by yourself to be satisfying. I was a tough guy who licked blood off the tip of a knife back in the day, I understand this principle the most.\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man clapped his hands.\n\n\"But now there's no way, unless you go to hell and bring back their souls. There's really no other way. They've probably already reincarnated, hahahaha... cough, cough, cough...\n\nIn the end,\n\nYou, Wang Ke, still couldn't get your revenge personally.\"\n\n\"It's good that they're dead...\"\n\n\"Heh, I really can't stand your attitude of being so open to everything. Damn it, you've been acting for so long, it's become instinct, right? Aren't you tired?\"\n\nThe man stood up, limping, and prepared to leave.\n\n\"The gun,\" Wang Ke reminded him.\n\n\"It's a toy, for your daughter. This place has such strict security, how could I bring a real one in?\n\nAre you kidding me?\"\n\nAfter the man left,\n\nWang Ke turned his head and looked at his wife, who was still sitting in the yard, lost in thought.\n\nHis wife seemed to sense something and turned to look at Wang Ke, smiling sweetly at him.\n\n\"The soup is almost ready, we can eat soon,\" Wang Ke called out.\n\n\"Okay, let's eat,\" his wife smiled happily.\n\nWang Ke tied his apron back on and walked into the kitchen.\n\nAs he was chopping the last of the scallions and chives with a knife, he looked at the blade and paused for a few seconds.\n\nHe muttered, \"They're just... dead like that?\"\n\n...\n\nMore than twenty years ago,\n\nAt the Tongcheng Port Gate's Qinzao Town Orphanage,\n\nIt was mealtime.\n\nEach child was given a piece of braised pork with preserved vegetables by an auntie. In this era, in this place, eating meat was indeed a happy thing.\n\nAlthough Chinese people were gradually escaping the era of not being able to afford food or meat, the conditions in orphanages were always a little slower than outside.\n\nTwo children were eating together.\n\nThe older child stared at the piece of meat for a long time, then picked up his chopsticks and placed it into the bowl of the child beside him, who was smaller than him.\n\n\"Brother, aren't you eating?\"\n\n\"No, you eat.\"\n\nThe shorter child was not polite and didn't understand modesty. He happily ate the two pieces of meat in his bowl, his lips greasy.\n\n\"Aze, in the future, I, your brother, will earn a lot of money, a lot, a lot of money.\"\n\nThe shorter boy picked up the grains of rice from his mouth and put them in, asking lazily, \"What are you earning money for?\"\n\n\"To get married.\"\n\n\"What are you getting married for?\"\n\n\"After getting married, I'll give money to my wife and have her buy me meat every day, and cook it for me, so I can eat meat every day!\"\n\n\"Is that what getting married means?\"\n\n\"Yes. What's the point of a wife who doesn't buy you meat to eat?\n\nIsn't Uncle Qin, the gatekeeper, always bragging to us\n\nAbout how his wife buys him meat and braises it for him every now and then?\n\nSo,\n\nGetting married,\n\nMeans earning money to be responsible for buying meat for her!\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand.\"\n\n\"What about you, Aze?\"\n\n\"If you have meat to eat, I have meat to eat too.\"\n\n...\n\nIn the woods,\n\nTwo walking corpses were still digging rapidly.\n\nThey were tireless,\n\nUnaware of pain,\n\nOnly knowing to complete the orders from above.\n\nThe pits were deepening at a visible rate,\n\nAnd the structural beams of an ancient temple were slowly being exposed.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nPolice Officer Zhang Yanfeng, who had always prioritized protecting his worldview,\n\nFelt his worldview shatter into a million pieces.\n\nHe kept looking at the two walking corpses emerging from the trees,\n\nThen he looked at Zhou Ze, who was standing still.\n\nBrother,\n\nIs this what you call protecting my worldview?\n\nIs this what you call letting me continue to live a normal life?\n\nSeeing this,\n\nHow can I live a normal life?\n\nBeneath the ground,\n\nThe Earth God, who felt a chill on his head, was furious and shouting,\n\n\"You're committing a sin!\n\nA sin!\n\nThey desecrated my temple and tomb, so I killed them as a warning. It's only right and proper!\n\nBut I didn't confine their souls, allowing their souls to descend to hell and be reincarnated!\n\nBody and soul are connected,\n\nTherefore, people attach great importance to their bodies being buried safely after death to achieve peace, because this affects the state of their souls in hell.\n\nYou have now turned their two bodies into walking corpses,\n\nThis is preventing their souls from ever having the chance of reincarnation, even in hell!\n\nThey will suffer endless torment in hell,\n\nAnd never be reborn!\"",

    "title": "Chapter 307: Sickness!",
    "content": "The old Taoist patted the mud off his robe, found there was too much, and gave up trying to clean it. He squatted beside Zhang Yanfeng and took out a cigarette, offering one to Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nZhang Yanfeng took the cigarette and slowly squatted down too.\n\nZhang Yanfeng wasn't young anymore, and the old Taoist was even older.\n\nThe two of them looked like old farmers squatting on the edge of a field, watching a village opera performance.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng still found it difficult to accept.\n\n\"Don't panic. Worldviews are most afraid of being distorted.\nOnce shattered, they aren't as scary. Reconstruction can actually be easier.\"\n\nThe old Taoist reached out and patted Officer Zhang's shoulder, continuing to mutter,\n\"It's this Earth God who's truly pathetic. Why pretend to be so great? Now he can only live for a few more episodes.\"\n\nIt's better to be awesome yourself; you can constantly test the boundaries and still survive.\nHaving been with Zhou Ze, the boss, for over a year, the old Taoist actually felt that Boss Zhou was a very easy-to-talk-to person, and he basically had no direct enemies. This was enough to show how good his social skills were.\nThis was because anyone who had a grudge against him was basically dead, hence he had no enemies.\nIn the old Taoist's opinion, Boss Zhou was like Xuan Ye from \"Kangxi's Private Visits,\" who liked to pretend to be a beggar and provoke people, then unlucky souls would come wanting to step on him.\nLater, he would reveal his true identity and crush those who tried to step on him.\n\nHe was used to it,\nnumb,\nexperienced.\n\nThe old Taoist exhaled a smoke ring and spat a mouthful of phlegm onto the ground.\n\"Ying Gou, Han Ba, Jiang Chen, Hou Qing, which one was the boss in his past life?\"\n\nThe old Taoist counted on his fingers. He was unlearned and knew a lot of folk tales, but he knew very little about ancient texts, so he couldn't distinguish which ones were recorded in ancient books and which were later fabrications from the internet.\nBut he should be one of these four, right?\nIn any case, they were very powerful.\n\n\"Are these zombies?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\"Mm, zombies.\"\n\"So, he's a zombie?\"\n\"Mm, a zombie.\"\n\"Meaning, he's not human, he's a zombie?\"\n\nThe old Taoist sighed and looked at Zhang Yanfeng with pity, \"Brother, listen to your elder brother's advice. Take a break tomorrow.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded.\nHe really needed a break.\n\nThe two walking corpses continued digging, tireless and incredibly fast. They had already dug past the ceiling beams.\nThen,\na series of \"crack\" sounds were heard. The ground began to sink, and the two walking corpses fell in. Wooden spikes appeared below, impaling them.\nTheir heads, hands, and feet were pierced, quite miserable.\nBut they were not dead; they continued to struggle. Although they couldn't break free, the pain they endured was real.\n\nA half-collapsed statue of a small Earth God appeared below. The paint had mostly chipped off the remaining half of the statue, showing how miserable this Earth God's situation was.\nHowever,\nit was impossible for him to be captured so easily, because Zhou Ze had no demands for negotiation. His goal was simple, as he had said before:\n\"Earth God... is delicious...\"\nThis left the Earth God with no option but to fight for his life.\n\nThe temple body was here. Although dilapidated, home is best. And once the temple body was completely destroyed, his hundred years of cultivation and the merit he had accumulated, which was not much but still hard-earned, would be utterly lost.\nAt the same time,\nhe would become a lonely ghost, a wild spirit, and be relegated to the ranks of the insignificant. If he was unlucky enough to encounter a chuunibyo Celestial Master from Mount Longhu coming down the mountain, he might even directly shout \"Acting on behalf of Heaven\" and stab him with a peach wood sword.\nThis temple body, this qualification as a local Earth God, he had fought for it from hundreds of mountain spirits and wild monsters. How could he give it up now?\n\n\"A mountain is not famous for its height, but for its immortal;\nWater is not deep for its depth, but for its dragon spirit!\"\n\nFrom below,\na chant could be heard.\nFollowing that,\nthe trees and vines in the surrounding area began to grow wildly. The vines, like ropes, coiled around Zhou Ze's limbs with lightning speed.\nZhou Ze was bound and lifted, his feet dangling in the air.\nThere were also some small, thorny vines that tried to pierce Zhou Ze's skin and enter his body, but they were completely repelled by Zhou Ze's shriveled, greenish skin.\nHe didn't move, nor did he struggle,\nbut the disdain in his eyes\nwas like appreciating the final performance of a person before their death.\nAfterward,\nthe lush green vines around him quickly withered, turning a desolate gray. The vines that had bound Zhou Ze all turned to ash and fluttered down.\nLegend has it,\nwhen Han Ba appears, the land for thousands of miles turns to drought!\nZombies,\nalready carry malevolent energy and curses. They stand opposite all life force. Only \"barren mountains and evil waters\" in feng shui can produce zombies. They are extreme beings born from extreme regions.\n\nZhou Ze fell back to the ground,\nbent down,\nlowered his head,\nand looked down from above.\n\n\"Rattle... rattle...\"\nThe damaged statue below began to shake, as if something was about to be unleashed.\n\n\"I,\nthe Earth God,\neven if all my merit is lost,\nand my temple body collapses,\nwill never bow down to you!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\nThe damaged statue shot out from the ground, somewhat like the \"double-cracklers\" used in rural funerals.\nHowever,\nZhou Ze simply reached down and pressed.\nHis five long claws drew a beautiful arc.\nThe statue, which had been charging fiercely, directly cracked and then shattered into pieces, scattering in the dust-filled hole below.\nHis most relied-upon ultimate move was resolved, and it didn't even scratch the opponent's skin.\n\n\"I want... you... merit... and temple body... what use are they?\"\n\nA smile appeared on Zhou Ze's lips.\nYes,\nother than that,\nhe didn't care about anything else.\nHe only cared about the Earth God's soul,\nfor the time being,\nlet's call it \"soul.\"\nHe needed to supplement himself, to nourish his own deficient state. He didn't care about anything else, and wouldn't care.\nTaking a step forward, Zhou Ze descended, supporting himself with one hand, landing steadily. The space around him was cramped and narrow. This didn't look like a temple of the Earth God at all, but more like a thief's treasure cave.\nAnd,\nthe ground was littered with gold and silver objects.\nFinally, he understood why this Earth God's situation had become so miserable. As a local Earth God, he was still infatuated with worldly gold and silver. It would be truly strange if such an Earth God could cultivate great merit.\n\nA faint green glow floated in front of Zhou Ze,\nclearly in a panic.\nHe had no more moves. To be precise, these were all the abilities he had, and none of them were of any use against the ferocious god in front of him.\nIn the end,\na final plea came from the green glow:\n\"I'll give you all the wealth here. Spare my life!\"\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe smile on Zhou Ze's lips widened.\nHe reached out and picked up a handful of silver coins, preparing to casually discard them.\nDid he lack money?\nTrying to bribe him with money?\nRidiculous.\nHowever,\nas he was about to throw the silver coins away,\nsuddenly,\nhis hand couldn't let go.\nIt tightly gripped the silver coins.\nThis...\nThe green light ring, almost in despair, rejoiced greatly.\nHahahaha,\nit seemed there was hope!\nZhou Ze grabbed his right hand with his left, forcing himself to open his right hand and discard the silver coins, but his right hand continued to grip the coins tightly, refusing to let go.\nThe smile on Zhou Ze's lips disappeared,\nreplaced by shame,\nanger,\ndissatisfaction,\nand,\nindignant acceptance!\n\n\"Are you very... lacking money?\"\nZhou Ze asked.\nHis right hand still tightly gripped the silver coins, refusing to let go.\n\"What's so good about money?\"\nHis right hand continued to grip the silver coins tightly, unmoved.\n\"What's the use of money?\"\nHis right hand: \"I won't listen, I won't listen to the monk's chanting!\"\n\"Don't... be... embarrassing like this...\"\nHis right hand gripped even tighter.\nZhou Ze's breathing began to quicken.\nHe remembered the feeling he had in the villa mirror not long ago.\nAt this moment,\nhe truly had the urge\nto smash his own head with a punch.\nShameful to exist!\n\"Not only here, I have others too. As long as you let me go, I'll tell you about the other two places where I've hidden gold and silver.\nAs the saying goes,\n'Three years as a clean prefect, a hundred thousand taels of silver;'\nAnd another saying goes, 'A thousand-mile official journey is only for wealth.' Although I am just a small local Earth God, I also have some savings. Giving all this money and treasures to you is not like casting pearls before swine.\"\n\nUpon hearing that there were two more places to hide gold and silver,\nZhou Ze's right hand\ntrembled even more violently.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a low growl,\nand then,\nsmashed his right fist directly into the ground. The rock wall cracked, but when he withdrew his hand, he found that even though the silver coins had deformed under the heavy pressure and turned into silver cakes, his right hand was still tightly gripping them, refusing to let go!\nThe Earth God prepared to strike while the iron was hot and continued,\n\"Not only my gold and silver, but I can also give you my status as an Earth God.\nA local Earth God is equivalent to a parent of that area!\nHow valuable land is nowadays,\nhow expensive it sells,\nthat's why housing prices are so high!\"\n\nZhou Ze scoffed disdainfully.\nLet me be an Earth God?\n\"Back then,\neven when the Yellow Emperor asked me to guard the Yellow Springs Netherworld, I refused.\nThis small area of Earth God,\nhow could I...\"\n\nAt this moment,\nZhou Ze was stunned to discover\nthat he couldn't speak anymore.\nHe even had the urge to nod his head in agreement!\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\nAbove their heads,\nthe old Taoist and Zhang Yanfeng were peeking down.\n\"Tsk tsk.\"\nThe old Taoist smacked his lips and sighed,\n\"Brother, I, your elder brother, have traveled far and wide and seen many difficult and complicated illnesses.\nBut there is only one illness for which there is no cure.\"\n\"What illness is it?\"\n\"The illness of poverty.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 308 Swallow!",
    "content": "“Let go!”\n\nZhou Ze roared.\n\n“Let go!!!”\n\nZhou Ze continued to roar.\n\n“Let me swallow him, and all his will be yours!”\n\n“Clink…”\n\nHis right hand finally loosened.\n\nWhether it was the result of effective resistance, or the other side giving up their obsession,\n\nThe sound of the silver coin hitting the ground was pleasant, crisp. If it were recorded and put to a vote, this would be among the most beautiful sounds in the world.\n\nBut along with the falling silver coin,\n\nThe Land God’s heart also fell.\n\nHe knew,\n\nHe was GG’d.\n\nThe bento box with added chicken legs in the distance was waving at him.\n\nWatching the man in front of him walk towards him step by step, having sealed off all possible escape routes, the Land God fell into complete despair.\n\n“Crack!”\n\nHis fingernails pinched the ball of green light.\n\nHe rubbed and kneaded it,\n\nAs if examining a piece of playdough, savoring it.\n\nThe Land God really wanted to shout at Zhou Ze, \"Hurry up and eat me if you're going to!\"\n\nThis process of waiting to be eaten was also a great torment!\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth,\n\nSlowly shoving it in.\n\nNo chewing was needed,\n\nBecause the moment his two fangs touched the green glow, everything was torn apart and transformed into a taste similar to Master Kang's Ice Green Tea,\n\nFlowing down his throat.\n\n“Hiss…”\n\nZhou Ze let out a low hum,\n\nThis extreme comfort emanating from the depths of his soul,\n\nWas truly unforgettable.\n\n“Boss, a smoke!”\n\nThe Old Daoist slid down from the slope, landing directly in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nHowever,\n\nAs the Old Daoist approached Zhou Ze,\n\nHe began to regret it.\n\nThere are some things that you can only truly grasp the terror of when you are close. It’s like looking at a tiger in a cage versus being inside the cage with the tiger. The distance might not be that different, but the feeling is worlds apart.\n\n“A smoke…”\n\nThe Old Daoist offered a cigarette,\n\nHis teeth began to chatter,\n\nBut he forced himself to continue,\n\n“A smoke after a meal is better than being an immortal.”\n\nZhou Ze slightly turned his head,\n\nLooking at the Old Daoist,\n\nHis gaze slightly narrowed.\n\nIn the depths of his ink-black pupils, a meaningful gleam flowed, making him inscrutable.\n\n“Gulp…”\n\nThe Old Daoist swallowed a mouthful of saliva,\n\nHe almost wanted to slap himself.\n\nDamn it,\n\nWas he so desperate to be bitten by a zombie?\n\nWas he so desperate for immortality?\n\nWhy did he impulsively come down just now?\n\nBut there was no other way,\n\nJust like Western vampires, the higher the level of the vampire that initiates your turning, the higher your starting point will be. The Old Daoist didn't want to be bitten by just any zombie and turn into a mindless zombie. He'd rather die of old age.\n\nMoreover,\n\nThe person in front of him, if nothing unexpected happened, was an ancestral-level BOSS in the zombie world!\n\nIn the past, the Old Daoist was always puzzled,\n\nWhy was Yingying so obediently subdued by the Boss back then?\n\nWas it Stockholm Syndrome?\n\nNow the Old Daoist understood.\n\nAs a zombie, even being… by this one was an honor!\n\n“Hoo…”\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a breath,\n\nThe cigarette in the Old Daoist’s hand automatically ignited and burned out instantly.\n\n“Hiss… Hot, hot!”\n\nThe Old Daoist quickly shook his hand. When he looked up at Zhou Ze again, he found him still looking at him with an inscrutable gaze.\n\n“Gulp…”\n\nSwallowing another mouthful of saliva, the Old Daoist stammered,\n\n“Yes, smoking is bad, it’s harmful to health.”\n\nZhou Ze turned around and slowly sat down, seemingly no longer intending to pay attention to the Old Daoist behind him.\n\nThen,\n\nThe Old Daoist felt a lightness all over him. The feeling of being stared at by countless venomous snakes had disappeared.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nThe Old Daoist rushed to look at Zhou Ze and found that he had already closed his eyes, with faint snores coming from his nose and mouth. He habitually checked the Boss’s body but found no exposed injuries.\n\nHe didn’t know whether he should be happy or sad,\n\nAfter all, compared to the gaze he had just experienced,\n\nThe Old Daoist still felt his boss was more approachable.\n\nThinking back to when the boss first learned to cheat, he would have to lie in bed for a month afterward. Now, there was nothing wrong. Something must have changed.\n\nThe Old Daoist sighed,\n\nImagining that one day he woke up,\n\nAnd found the spot by the window empty,\n\nThat man wasn't reading the newspaper or drinking coffee, just looking at him with that kind of gaze.\n\nThe thought alone was terrifying.\n\n“It’s here, there was a loud noise here just now!”\n\nNot far away, voices suddenly became boisterous, and police sirens could be heard from the road outside the woods.\n\nThe Old Daoist had just managed to carry Zhou Ze out of the pit and was about to go back down to pick up the gold and silver coins.\n\n“Let’s go, if we don’t leave now, it will be too late.”\n\nZhang Yanfeng took Zhou Ze and carried him on his back, urging the Old Daoist.\n\n“But…”\n\nAll that money was down there.\n\nHow many unfortunate young ladies could he help with this money, giving them warmth?\n\nHow many children could he help escape poverty?\n\n“These are cultural relics!\n\nThey should be handed over to the state!”\n\nZhang Yanfeng said righteously.\n\nFigures could already be seen in the distance. The Old Daoist gritted his teeth and did not dare to delay any longer, following Zhang Yanfeng out.\n\nThe two returned to the parking spot, settled Zhou Ze in the back seat, and then sat in the front. Zhang Yanfeng quickly started the car and left.\n\n“How will you close the case when you get back?” the Old Daoist asked.\n\nCould the closing statement be written as, \"The deceased angered the Land God and was killed by the Land God as punishment\"?\n\nAnd then the Land God wouldn't need to be apprehended or interrogated,\n\nBecause the Land God was eaten by a great zombie.\n\n“Accidentally, accidentally. Suicide, suicide.” Zhang Yanfeng exhaled a breath.\n\n“Got it.”\n\nThe Old Daoist yawned.\n\n…\n\nWhen they returned to the bookstore, the Old Daoist carried the boss inside and found the little loli sitting behind the counter, playing cards in her hand.\n\n“What’s wrong with him?”\n\n“Drunk.”\n\nThe Old Daoist ignored the little loli and carried the boss upstairs. Yingying was playing games in the bedroom. Seeing the boss being carried back, she was also startled.\n\nBut she was experienced. As she helped settle the boss on the bed, she instructed the Old Daoist to get monkey urine.\n\n“Heh heh, this time, it’s okay.”\n\nThe Old Daoist rubbed his head and said.\n\nBai Yingying froze for a moment,\n\nShe lifted Zhou Ze’s clothes and carefully examined him from all sides. She indeed found no wounds.\n\nBut for some reason, Bai Yingying bit her lip tighter.\n\nHonestly, she seemed to prefer seeing a boss covered in blood and wounds rather than seeing him now, as if nothing had happened.\n\nBecause the Old Daoist could sense the seriousness and the specific meaning behind it, Bai Yingying could naturally do the same.\n\n“You take care of him first, I’ll go down and take a look.”\n\nThe Old Daoist instructed Yingying and went downstairs.\n\nAt the staircase, he ran into the little loli who was coming up. The little loli ignored the Old Daoist and walked up on her own, pushing open Zhou Ze’s bedroom door.\n\n“Yo, you came back intact this time.”\n\nThe little loli leaned against the doorway, chewing gum.\n\n“None of your business!”\n\n“Of course, I don’t care. You should be happy in your heart, from now on you’ll have a real powerful backer.”\n\nA meaningful smile appeared on the little loli’s lips.\n\nBai Yingying looked at her with some confusion.\n\n“I say, what about the night of the Cold Clothing Festival, bamboo as a bed, my body burned, hahaha.”\n\nThe little loli waved her hand, looking disdainful.\n\n“I became a ghost messenger only a few years ago, but Madam Bai has been a temple deity here for two hundred years. If there’s something I can’t see, she might be able to see it.\n\nWhy didn’t she entrust you to me when I was here?\n\nAnd why did she entrust you to him when I went to Rongcheng?\n\nSomeone who was just a temporary ghost messenger and no different from trash back then?”\n\nThe little loli recalled that night Zhou Ze held the corpse pill,\n\nThinking of putting it in his own mouth,\n\nThen moving it to Bai Yingying’s mouth,\n\nThe image of his indecision.\n\n“Do you think everyone is as utilitarian as you are?” Bai Yingying retorted.\n\n“Heh, you can know a person’s face but not their heart. How would I know what you’re thinking?”\n\n“I… don’t have a heart.”\n\nI am a zombie,\n\nI don’t have a heart.\n\nThe little loli walked to the bedside and looked at Zhou Ze, who was still sleeping. She took a deep breath and said,\n\n“Ummm…\n\nNot even a hint of blood,\n\nIt seems,\n\nIt’s really close.”\n\nSaying that,\n\nThe little loli reached out and gently patted Bai Yingying’s shoulder.\n\n“Actually, I believe you were sincere.”\n\nBai Yingying’s eyes narrowed slightly.\n\n“The foolish have foolish blessings.”\n\nSaying that, the little loli walked out of the bedroom. She didn’t go downstairs but turned into the adjacent room.\n\nOn the bed,\n\nXu Niangniang was still in a coma,\n\nAs if she had no intention of waking up and continuing to be an ostrich for the rest of her life.\n\nThe little loli spat out her gum.\n\n“Hey, if you don’t wake up, your man will be gone. Do you know that?”\n\nXu Niangniang remained unmoved.\n\n“Heh heh.”\n\nThe little loli sat on the bedside table and looked at Xu Niangniang, who was wearing pajamas, especially at her smooth, fair skin that even women would envy and go crazy for.\n\n“Tsk tsk, she’s had a long enough beauty sleep.”\n\nZhou Ze had originally planned to wake Xu Qinglang with his fingernails after he recovered, but he had been constantly delayed by various matters.\n\nAt this moment, the Old Daoist came up with his dirty clothes. Bare-chested, he was startled to see the little loli in the room.\n\n“What are you doing here?”\n\nThe Old Daoist was very wary of the little loli.\n\n“I wanted to see if I could wake him up.”\n\n“Wake him up? Heh, forget it.”\n\n“Not necessarily. I heard that the average housing prices in Tongcheng have fallen for the first time in ten years recently.”\n\n“Fallen?” the Old Daoist asked, surprised. “Fallen by how much?”\n\nThe little loli held up five fingers.\n\n“Fallen by five thousand? That’s a significant price drop.”\n\nThe little loli shook her head.\n\n“Five hundred? What good is that?”\n\nThe little loli continued to shake her head and said,\n\n“It’s fifty, fifty yuan, RMB.”\n\nThe Old Daoist: “(━┳━_━┳━)”\n\n“Fifty, that’s not a small amount either.” The little loli pointed to Xu Qinglang, who was still in a coma on the bed. “Most of his apartments are three bedrooms, one living room. If we assume they are 130 square meters each, and he has twenty-five units, with a price drop of fifty per square meter, that means he has lost over 160,000.\n\nA car,\n\nJust like that, evaporated.”\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking,\n\nXu Qinglang, who had been in a coma for an unknown amount of time,\n\nHis finger suddenly trembled.",

    "content": "\"Holy shit, he's awake, he's really awake, Mother of God!!!\"\n\nThe old Daoist looked at Xu Qinglang with a hint of surprise. He had just seen Xu Qinglang's finger twitch, and then his body shifted slightly.\n\n\"Old Xu, wake up quickly, start your harem competition!\" the old Daoist shouted, intending to stoke the flames.\n\nImmediately after, Xu Qinglang's body convulsed. He instinctively turned sideways and gagged towards the floor. The old Daoist emptied his plastic basin of dirty clothes and placed it underneath Xu Qinglang, while with his other hand, he stroked Xu Qinglang's back, saying, \"It's good that you're awake, good that you're awake.\"\n\nXu Qinglang gagged for a while but didn't spit anything out. If Zhou Ze were present, he would have noticed that due to prolonged unconsciousness, some of his bodily functions had entered a semi-dormant state. This gagging was similar to a car left out in the cold for a long time, starting up and preheating again. After all, Old Xu was merely unconscious, a self-imposed shutdown due to \"heart sickness,\" not a \"vegetative state.\"\n\nIn fact, the possibility of most people in vegetative states waking up is very low, and even if they miraculously awoke, it would be nearly impossible for them to return to normal. Most would remain in a dazed state, unable to care for themselves. As for those vegetative patients who wake up, remember everything, and can still \"happily\" fall in love, such events generally only happen in romance novels and TV dramas.\n\nAfter gagging for a period, Xu Qinglang opened his eyes, glanced at the old Daoist and the little loli beside him, then drowsily turned his head and fell asleep again. This time, the sleep was just for the body's rest; the person was actually awake.\n\n\"You wait, I'll go make some soup for you to nourish your body,\" the old Daoist happily ran out. The little loli glanced at Xu Qinglang, whose chest was gently rising and falling on the bed, pouted, and muttered softly, \"They really are birds of a feather.\"\n\nOld Xu was awake, which was happy news. The old Daoist busied himself serving him, letting Old Xu drink and eat something before he slept again. The old Daoist finally had some free time to take a bath, change into a clean Taoist robe, and went downstairs, returning to his bar area. A pot of old yellow wine, a plate of dried white anchovies, and a newspaper in front of him, he would occasionally take a small sip of yellow wine, pick a couple of dried anchovies, and pop them in his mouth, humming a little tune and reading the newspaper, just like the boss, stealing half a day of leisure from life. The large potted plant was placed beside the old Daoist to ward off mosquitoes and insect bites; it was a treatment that only the boss used to enjoy, but now the old Daoist was enjoying it too.\n\nThere were usually few customers during the day, and sometimes the old Daoist would sit there all day with nothing to do. However, just as he was getting into his rhythm, three people walked into the study. The old Daoist shrugged helplessly, put on a smile, and asked, \"What would you three like to drink?\"\n\n\"A pot of Longjing, please.\" The visitors were two young people and an old man who was older than the old Daoist.\n\n\"Alright, sit over there and wait.\" The old Daoist went to the back to make tea. The two young people helped the old man choose a spot not far from the bar and sat down. The old man's face was covered with age spots, and he leaned on a cane, wearing a white t-shirt with holes. He sat down with the careful assistance of those beside him. The two young people sat opposite him, one taking out a voice recorder and the other a notebook, ready to record something at any moment.\n\n\"Oh, an interview?\" The old Daoist came over with the teapot and teacups, placed them one by one, and poured the tea.\n\n\"Yes.\" One of the young people responded, pointing at the old man in front of him, \"This is a veteran of the War of Resistance.\"\n\n\"Oh, elder brother, I admire you!\" The old Daoist gave the old man in front of him a thumbs-up. The old man sitting there merely nodded reservedly. He had few teeth left and seemed to have difficulty speaking. His hearing was also not very good. To put it bluntly, at this age and in this condition, he was already half in the grave. The old Daoist felt sympathetic and said directly, \"In that case, this pot of tea today is on me. I'll bring you some snacks too.\"\n\n\"Thank you, boss,\" the two young people thanked the old Daoist.\n\n\"You're welcome, it's my duty, my duty.\" The old Daoist, who was usually very stingy, was uncharacteristically generous this time. He returned behind the bar, tidied up a few plates of dried fruits and melon seeds, and brought them over. After placing them down, the old Daoist didn't leave, grabbing some melon seeds for himself. He leaned against the bar, cracking them open and listening.\n\nThe old Daoist was born in the year the People's Republic of China was founded, so he hadn't experienced the war years. However, his habit was such that he enjoyed hearing stories from others. In the early years, there were quite a few storytellers, but they gradually disappeared.\n\n\"Sir, shall we begin now?\" the young man asked. The old man nodded. The interview began. The two young people were reporters from a small newspaper, doing a special column interviewing veterans of the War of Resistance. The old man's first sentence made the old Daoist's heart stir. Although the old man spoke slowly and somewhat unclearly, his Shaanbei accent made the old Daoist feel exceptionally close. Damn it, a fellow countryman! The old Daoist hesitated whether to give them anything else. He would put this money into the bar's till himself. Public property was public property, and his was his. He, the old Daoist, wouldn't stoop to secretly taking advantage of Boss Zhou. After all, Boss Zhou was so poor. Looking at how the boss clutched that handful of silver coins last night, the old Daoist felt a pang of pity. What a deep obsession!\n\nThe old man's interview continued. He spoke slowly but very clearly. It was as if he had rehearsed it in his mind, or rather, he must have had many such interviews, so he had gotten used to how to speak.\n\n\"Because I was in the National Army, I felt like I couldn't hold my head up high for a long time, and gradually, I developed the habit of speaking little.\" When the old man reached this point, the young reporter immediately said, \"You've worked hard, Elder Jia.\" The other reporter picked up the teapot and refilled the old man's cup, placing it in front of him. The old Daoist continued to crack melon seeds beside them, listening with great interest.\n\nMany things from that era were difficult to explain clearly, but at least the current social atmosphere was progressing and correcting mistakes, and people's understanding was no longer as limited as before. As long as someone had shed blood for the country, regardless of their identity or personal conduct, they were worthy of respect.\n\n\"I joined the army back then, actually, it was to get a full meal. I was young then, only 14 years old when I joined the army. I wasn't educated and didn't understand any grand principles. I understood many principles later, only realizing that fighting back then was quite glorious. Fighting and stopping, stumbling along, by 1945, the troops were stationed in Shaanxi. I was in the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Company, 3rd Platoon of the 90th Division, 30th Army of the First Group Army. Commander Hu Zongnan, Army Commander Lu Chongyi, Division Commander Wang Huimin, Regiment Commander Gao Shuxun, Company Commander surnamed Chen, Platoon Leader surnamed Liu. I remember it very clearly, I always remembered the unit's designation. They forced us to remember it, saying that even if we died in battle, we could still rally our former comrades in hell to continue fighting the Japanese.\"\n\nThe two reporters listened patiently, taking notes. These reports would be published soon, aiming to call for society's attention and care for these veterans of the War of Resistance, especially those from the Nationalist Army. Judging by the state of the two reporters, whose eyes were already turning red, it was clear that after this report was published, many people would shed tears because of it, everyone would be moved by this veteran of the War of Resistance, and at the same time, they would curse...\n\nThe old Daoist frowned, \"That's not right. In 1945, Gao Shuxun was a regiment commander? How do I remember that Gao Shuxun was already an army commander in 1940? And Gao was a veteran general of Feng Yuxiang's Northwest Army faction, how did he end up as a subordinate of Hu Zongnan? And looking at this old man, oh, he must have misremembered. After all, he's old, it's normal.\" The old Daoist said nothing and continued cracking melon seeds.\n\n\"The unit moved to Hanzhong, Shaanxi, and then engaged in battles with the Japanese at Baqiao and Weinan in Xi'an. I forgot the enemy unit's designation, but I remember their guns were much better than ours. They used Arisaka, while our unit used Hubei sticks. The fighting was fierce, and our casualties were always more than the Japanese. Because I was young, my comrades took good care of me. Once, during a battle with the Japanese, an enemy shell hit my thigh. I didn't feel any pain at the time; blood flowed down my pant leg and into my shoes. It was my comrades who saved me and took me to the field hospital to recuperate... ... After the Japanese were defeated, during the War of Liberation, our company commander led us to defect from the front lines. Because, Chinese people don't fight Chinese people...\"\n\nOne of the reporters was already wiping tears with a napkin. The other reporter next to him choked up, \"Chinese people don't fight Chinese people. Good, well said. You've suffered, Elder Jia. The hardships and grievances you've endured over the years will be rewarded. This is your interview fee for this time. Please accept it to improve your life. The people of the motherland will not forget you, nor will society. We will help you promote it...\"\n\n\"Wait, wait!!!\" The old Daoist beside them couldn't listen anymore. He immediately stepped forward, banged the table forcefully, and shouted, \"Aren't you talking nonsense!\"\n\n\"Boss, what do you mean by that?\" the young reporter asked, frowning at the boss. The old Daoist didn't bother with the two reporters immediately. Instead, he pointed at the old man who had just finished speaking and was accepting the thick stack of red envelopes and scolded him, \"The more you talk, the more ridiculous it gets! The thing our elders in Tongguan are most proud of is that no matter how the Japanese planes bombed, they never let the Japanese cross Fenglingdu! You, damn it, you fought battles at Baqiao and Weinan, go ask those damn Japanese if they could have passed Hangu Pass back then!\"\n\nAfter speaking, the old Daoist pointed at the two young reporters who were still in a state of \"Moved China,\" \"Are your brains flooded? You invite a liar to be interviewed and cry your eyes out. Is your head full of mush?\"",

It is not illuminating or shining, but it is more like an eye, standing silently on top and staring at everything below with a sarcasm and mocking emotion.\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n\n\nNot in humans,\n\n\n\nInstead,\n\n\n\n Full\n\n\n\nSitting up, Zhou Ze suddenly felt a little hot. It was the kind of hot heat that made people feel panicked and uncomfortable, just like being thrown into a sealed carriage in the summer.\n\n\n\nHolding the ground with his hand, he slowly stood up, looking around, Zhou Ze discovered that there was a pit around him\n\n\n\nThe pit is not very big.\n\n\n\nIt's just the area of a small pond.\n\n\n\nNot very deep,\n\n\n\nIt's just the height of two people\n\n\n\nThe pit was covered with a layer of yellow-brown grass, densely packed, and it was full of life, like the hair of countless old men, coming back to the ground with the scorching wind.\n\n\n\nA little bit,\n\n\n\n  It looks familiar\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked forward silently two steps.\n\n\n\nThen he remembered,\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n\n\nIt looks familiar,\n\n\n\nBecause he has been here several times\n\n\n\nOriginally, there should be a pond here, filled with water, as if the resentment of the dead, the scenery formed by dripping water dripping from the Huangquan Road.\n\n\n\nDeep in the pond,\n\n\n\nThere should also be Zhou Ze’s old acquaintance.\n\n\n\nFaceless woman\n\n\n\n  only,\n\n\n\nThe scene in front of you clearly feels like \"people go to the empty building\".\n\n\n\nThere is no more water,\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl is gone,\n\n \n\nAs if a hand reached here, pulling all living things here\n\n\n\n  Lord,\n\n\n\nIt will also cause drought\n\n\n\nThis problem arose in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n\n\nAt this time,\n\n\n\nIt should be a dream.\n\n\n\nDreaming back to the ground\n\n\n\nZhou Ze remembered that there was a famous man named Dante in foreign history who once visited the local archery during his dream week. After waking up, he wrote a book called \"Divine Comedy\"After his rebirth, Zhou Ze also found this book and read it with a tribute to Zheng who had never been before.\n\n\n\nAfter reading it, Zhou Ze confirmed that the celebrity had actually dreamed.\n\n\n\nBut it's daydreaming.\n\n\n\nWhat he described as a place and what Zhou Ze saw with his own eyes were not the same place at all\n\n\n\nZhou Ze looked far away, where is Huangquan Road\n\n\n\nNo matter day and night, no matter when,\n\n\n\nThe road is always full of dense and busy scenes.\n\n\n\nBecause everyone is dead every moment,\n\n\n\nNo matter how the way death is, there are all kinds of strange things, but the fate of the deceased is here\n\n\n\n  However,\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the past through the video,\n\n\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze saw that the Huangquan Road was still full of time, those people did not continue to walk forward, but instead lined up row by row, like elementary school students in the volleyball team to participate in the flag-raising ceremony.\n\n\n\nA gap was vacant on Huangquan Road, and the embossment was like an emergency road on the expressway.\n\n\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, the dead souls on Huangquan Road seemed to be going to participate in the \"Huanghe Chorus\", and there was only one person who started it.\n\n\n\nThen there is the magnificent mountains and seas:\n\n\n\n\"The wind is roaring and the horse is roaring and the river is roaring...\"\n\n\n\nBreathing is a bit difficult. Although you don’t need to breathe at all on the ground, you can still feel the terrifying pressure that looks like from the chest cavity.\n\n\n\nI feel like a thorn slapped on the fried pill, and it will become coke after a few bounces.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk forward, and he slowly walked to the Huangquan Road, and then walked up.\n\n\n\nHere, why is it so hot?\n\n\n\n  and,\n\n\n\nPeople on Huangquan Road,\n\n\n\n  It's stopped no matter how\n\n\n\nAt this moment,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly heard a shout from the far away.\n\n\n\nTurning over to look at the past,\n\n\n\nA group of people are rushing here\n\n\n\nIf they can still be considered human\n\n\n\nBecause although they retained their human image, they had been tortured by various incredible tortures and completely inhumane.\n\n\n\nThis is a difficult degree of abuse to describe in words.\n\n\n\nWhen Tang Fan was still in a bookstore,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze once asked Tang Po, what is the difference between torture in the local dynasty and the reality\n\n\n\nAlthough they were all \"smugglers\" from the land corpses, Zhou Ze just stopped outside and came out early with his fingernails. He had never experienced the crazy people in the depths of the land.\n\n\n\nTherefore, when facing Tang Polygon, every time he heard the two words \"district\" and his expression trembled, Zhou Ze had a very strong curiosity.\n\n\n\nBecause it is unknown, I am curious\n\n\n\nCurious about such a firm and strong girl, why is she so profound about that wordTang Fengshang's answer is very simple.\n\n\n\n  The general meaning is,\n\n\n\n In human torture, be careful not to kill people directly, because once the torture dies, there is no meaning to do anything torture.\n\n\n\nThe torture of the landlords is different. They can have 10,000 ways to ensure that your soul will not collapse.\n\n\n\n  then,\n\n\n\nOn this basis,\n\n\n\nAll kinds of tortures are like little angels who have lost their shackles.\n\n\n\nBegins to show the crazy imagination of the people who are storming\n\n\n\nWhat Zhou Cheng saw was running towards him,\n\n\n\nJust helping inmates\n\n\n\nThey were running, they ran in a daze, maybe they didn't know why they were running, or where they could go, but they were still running\n\n\n\nOr maybe,\n\n\n\nFor them,\n\n\n\nCan run,\n\n\n\nThis process,\n\n\n\nIn this long-standing torture life in the local corps,\n\n\n\nIt's also a kind of happiness\n\n\n\nBecause of their coming, many souls on the nearby Huangquan Road also had some strange movements. They were originally numb and pointed to their tiptoe and showed other emotional waves on their faces at this time.\n\n\n\n  people,\n\n\n\nThere is a kind of emotion from the public.\n\n\n\nAnd even though I can still survive, don’t say it’s human\n\n\n\nJust when Zhou Ze thought that the Domino domino effect was about to be unleashed,\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\nA sound of whip,\n\n\n\nLike a shocking thunder falling down\n\n\n\nThe dead souls who were standing on Huangquan Road had a little strange color and became numb again in this sound.\n\n\n\nEven among the prisoners, several people who were running stopped and stood numbly, entering the standing army on Huangquan Road.\n\n \n\nBut there are still many people running, even though they are very difficult now, and even if they are very confused now, they are like flying moths.\n\n\n\nContinue to run forward\n\n\n\nRunning in the front,\n\n\n\nIt's a girl,\n\n\n\nIn the real world, to describe a girl’s way forward, you can say how little she wears and how simple and perfunctory the part that covers the flesh.\n\n\n\nThe girl in front of you,\n\n\n\nMore forward-looking,\n\n\n\nBecause she doesn't have much meat on her body.\n\n\n\nThere is a little on the face,\n\n\n\nThere is something on my chest that is shaking.\n\n\n\nThere are a few pieces on your legs,\n\n\n\n There is almost no replenishment before\n\n\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously reached out to stop her.\n\n\n\nEven preparing to use your own nails.\n\n\n\nBut at this moment,\n\n\n\nThe second whip is transmitted,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze only felt that his fingers were numb and his heart was connected. When a sensational pain passed by, it made him a little difficult to bear it. At the same time, he also felt a little vigilant in his heart.The prisoners ran out one after another in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and found that his nails were already filled with blood. Some prisoners even exclaimedly penetrated Zhou Ze's body directly, as if Zhou Ze did not exist at all.\n\n\n\n  yes,\n\n\n\nI'm not really a dead soul coming back,\n\n\n\nThis is just a dream\n\n\n\nI don’t know how many prisoners ran past him,\n\n\n\nLater,\n\n\n\nAnother group of people chased after him. They were wearing ancient black and white clothes, holding iron chains and shackles in their hands. Some prisoners who stopped running were captured by them.\n\n\n\n  finally,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw a woman wearing a crown in the crowd.\n\n\n\nIt looks like it is about thirty or forty,\n\n\n\nThe face seemed to be covered with a thick layer of rouge, making it difficult for people to see clearly her true appearance.\n\n\n\nBut in her hands,\n\n\n\nHolding a leather whip,\n\n\n\nThis is a purple whip.\n\n\n\n  After holding it in the hand, it was like a giant python dancing in the air, and on the whip were engraved with countless roaring faces, as if they were held in it that they would never be reborn.\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\nThe whip fell down,\n\n\n\nThe dead souls on Huangquan Road seem to have returned to their former mode.\n\n\n\nHe began to continue to tiptoe forward with a numb expression.\n\n\n\nLike a pig dog that is being wrapped in a circle\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\nAnother whip fell,\n\n\n\nAround, the wind is rising.\n\n\n\nLater,\n\n\n\nIt's raining,\n\n\n\nIn that moment,\n\n\n\nHeavy rain,\n\n\n\nThe dry pond that Zhou Cheng saw before slowly began to accumulate rainwater again\n\n\n\nThe woman holding a whip and wearing a crown seemed to deliberately sweep Zhou Ze at the location of her.\n\n\n\n  Slightly brows,\n\n\n\nSubconsciously snatched the whip in his hand,\n\n\n\nPicking to Zhou Ze\n\n\n\n  A moment,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze only felt that the atmosphere like the mountains and seas were crushing towards him.\n\n\n\nI am like a small boat in the huge waves.\n\n\n\nIt may be overturned at any time\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\n …………\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly sat up from the bed\n\n\n\nThe white baoli, who had just helped Zhou Ze kill a mosquito, looked at Zhou Ze with surprise and shouted:\n\n\n\n\"Boss, you're awake\"\n\n\n\n\"Huhuhu……Huhuhu……………”\n\n\n\nZhou Ze could only breathe heavily, and he couldn't respond to Bai Bao Bao\n\n\n\n\"Boss, you scared me just now. I've been sweating a lot. I'll help you take a shower.\"\n\n\n\nBai Baobao said and walked over and prepared to carry his boss down the building.\n\n\n\nShe has already done her habits in doing these things.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze himself is also illHowever,\n\n\n\nAt this moment,\n\n\n\nThe bedroom door was pushed open suddenly,\n\n\n\nXiao Luli stood at the door panting\n\n\n\n\"You are fucking\"\n\n\n\nBai Baobao looked at Xiao Luoli standing at the door, thinking that she was deliberately destroying her time and her boss.\n\n\n\n\"Zhou Ze...Zhou Ze...\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli panted and raised her ghost messenger.\n\n\n\nHe shouted hurriedly:\n\n\n\n\"Zhou Ze, it's not good.

He drank all the brains. Only then did he feel that he had a lot of experience in his heart.\n\n\n\nIn my dreams, the baking feeling was really hard to bear. Even when I woke up now, I still felt a little nervous. It was like when I was playing in the swimming pool for an afternoon and just came out.

Then, like the one who forced Changzhou last time, go around and catch a few ghost officers as their subordinates, and you can officially become the custody.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli looks like a helper.\n\n\n\n  To give your husband the best planner’s blueprint and future development direction as possible,\n\n\n\nIt's just because I'm worried\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze did not care much about the so-called performance, at least from the divine attitude he showed, it was like this.\n\n\n\nHe just asked:\n\n\n\n\"How did this help prisoners come out?\"\n\n\n\n  Yes,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was very curious.\n\n\n\nWhy can this help prisoners run out?\n\n\n\n The earthly zodiac signs are not ten halls of the Luo River and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva\n\n\n\nThere are also countless soldiers and the large Sisi Town pressure, how can someone still run out?\"We don't need to pay too much attention to this kind of thing, and we can't pay attention to the current level. However, if you must have wanted to know, I can tell you.\n\n\n\nThe ground turret is not a piece of iron plate. It also has various forces, intrigue, open and secret struggles. In fact, every violence and evil spirit escape from the ground turret, the head here cannot escape the force of the above force.\n\n\n\nThe yang and the sun are divided into two ways, but it is like the emperor in the yang who has always dreamed of being a king and a domineering place in the garrison even after he died. So the garrison was built and the burial of the tomb was buried with terracotta figurines or even living people. Waiting for him to kill him into the garrison together.\n\n\n\nThe giants of the landlords have actually never given up their penetration of the sun. Among these evil spirits, there are even two of them that are pawns in the hands of a big shot, but it is too difficult to see if they just let people go out to eat, so they often make such a violent situation, leaving one or two of their pawns hidden in it and send them to the sun.\n\n\n\nMost of the evil spirits who escaped were the targets our ghost officers needed to capture, and the dragon traps that ran away became our ghost officers' advanced supplements.\n\n\n\nBut you also know that the two protected ones are not that easy to catch. They are even more terrifying than us in terms of strength. Of course, if they catch them and send them, the reward will be even greater. Although they will be abusing the bosses of one side, the CI has its own independent constitution.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's still a bit difficult to understand.\"\n\n\n\n\"For example, the one who killed us so many ghosts in Chengdu last time.\" Xiao Luoli looked at Zhou Ze, \"Haha, I think he may be the special one among the evil ghosts who escaped violently in the past two years.\n\n\n\nIf you have the opportunity to see what his soul is really like, you will definitely be very, very depressed and basically be abused to the point of being unhealthy.\n\n\n\nIncluding the woman named Tang Fan, the true image of her soul will definitely not be as sluggish as her body shape now, and she also likes to wear short slim skirts.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli unconsciously gave Zhou Ze a beautiful woman with eye medicine\n\n\n\nThink about it, many men have functional dysfunction for artificial beauties. If they know that under this body is a soul that has been tortured to death, the obstacle will definitely be even bigger.\n\n\n\nFor Zhou Ze, it is equivalent to adding another obstacle to the obstacle\n\n\n\n\"What about me?\" Zhou Ze pointed at himself\n\n\n\n\"You are a special case. The one who got crazy wanted to play tricks on his sister to be concerned about his sister, but you are different. It is still unknown who is playing who is playing.\n\n\n\nAnd you are not a vicious ghost, you just come back from the outside and don’t go in.”\n\n\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed Xiao Luli's head\n\n\n\nXiao Luli smiled at him\n\n\n\nAt this moment,\n\n\n\nThis scene,\n\n\n\nLike a foolish father and daughter, sitting together to comfort each other's life\"If you want to prevent the one in your body from replacing you, the best way is to climb up step by step, constantly obtain the seal from the celestials, and use the celestials' life and your identity to suppress him in reverse.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli felt so tired.\n\n\n\nReally tired,\n\n\n\nIt's really hard to urge a fish to produce some main visual energy.\n\n\n\n\"For example, your ghost messenger is completely different from others'. I have no choice but to compare mine and yours. This is your deed.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli pointed to Zhou Ze's ghost messenger and said seriously\n\n\n\nTo put it bluntly, Xiao Luoli means that what is behind you Zhou Ze is not a yangdao, but a single bridge with no retreat, so you can only rely on this road to move forward. Otherwise, you will be replaced by it, which is really not far away.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took another sip of water, stood up, stretched out his waist and said:\n\n\n\n\"Then let's catch this person in Tongzhou first. He is a woman. The uploader is a poisonous man and was shot. Now the ghost messenger has marked her position in Shigang Town, Tongzhou District. How did this name come about?\"\n\n\n\n\"Xi Si's eyes are much more than you and I think. As long as she doesn't have a special way to deliberately hide her words, we can know where she is, and when we arrive at that town, we will feel more specific.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then let's catch her first.\" Zhou Ze thought for a while and said, \"There are so many evil spirits, there are only two in Tongcheng.\"\n\n\n\n\"You have captured the one in Tongcheng, you can also go to other places to catch it. In Changzhou, you just took over a little brother, but you can go and help me.\n\n\n\nOh, by the way, this time I arrested the evil ghost, even if you sent it, as long as I help, I can still share the performance.”\n\n\n\nXiao Luli is just to understand why she is so aggressive\n\n\n\nThe two of them walked off the stairs. The first thing Zhou Ze saw was Xu Qinglang lying on the sofa and applying a facial mask on his face.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment.\n\n\n\nThen a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and walked over directly, punching Xu Qinglang's chest with a punch\n\n\n\n  \"grass\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang covered his chest and fell directly from the sofa. He opened the mask on his face and looked at Zhou Ze in confusion:\n\n\n\n\"I just woke up and my body was weak.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's good that you wake up.\" Zhou Ze sat down on the sofa, \"I'm going to leave later, let's have a meal.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Xu Qinglang\n\n\n\nAlthough I was not satisfied with this kind of treatment, I probably went upstairs to the kitchen to make meals. For a person who is good at cooking, making exquisite food to give the character around me is a very enjoyable thing.\n\n\n\nAnd Xu Qinglang also understood that his coma had caused a lot of trouble to the people around him. Sometimes he could feel that Zhou Ze was doing a careful physical examination for himself every day.\n\n\n\nBy the time Xu Qinglang went up,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze asked the old saying next to him:\n\n\n\n\"How did he wake up\"\n\n\n\n\"The house price has dropped, and I was so scared that I woke up and prepared to sell it.\"\n\n \n\n  \"hehe\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, looking like he didn't think it was natural\n\n\n\n  now,\n\n\n\n  house,\n\n\n\nWhat is it\n\n\n\nAt this time, news was playing on the first floor. The French World Cup defeated Croatia and won the Hercules Cup.\n\n\n\n  then,\n\n\n\nThe news screen changed, and it seemed like some archaeological excavators were visited in the wild. What kind of ancient tombs should have been unearthed. There should be a lot of cultural relics hidden in it.\n\n\n\nJust look at the uncontrollable smile on the staff member's face.\n\n\n\n\"The ancient tomb was dug out again,\" Zhou Ze asked\n\n\n\n\"Op\" The old Taoist had a snail and subconsciously placed a cup of tea in front of Zhou Ze, but the consequences of the gap was suddenly opened.\n\n\n\n\"Haha, when it comes to the ancient tomb, by the way, old man, where did you put the gold coins of that land?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze asked, picked up the teacup in front of him, and took a sip.\n\n\n\n  money,\n\n\n\nFinally it is no longer a problem.\n\n\n\nSo many gold coins,\n\n\n\nEven if you don’t buy a house, such a lot of metal is placed at home, it is definitely a hard goods, and there is no problem in resisting inflation.\n\n\n\nMost importantly,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze always dreamed of being like Grandet, lying on his own gold and silver mountain pile without any trouble to criticize the stinky capitalism of the crime\n\n\n\n  \"This…………\"\n\n\n\n  \"What's up\"\n\n\n\n\"It's here\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist timidly pointed at the TV.\n\n\n\n\"I was in a hurry at that time, and someone came again. The underworld was not enough to get it. Officer Zhang said that these were all cultural relics and needed to be handed over to the country.\"\n\n\n\n\"Click\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze still had a faint smile on his face.\n\n\n\nBut the teacup in his hand was crushed directly by him.\n\n\n\nThe blood on the fingers dripped down the teacup fragments.\n\n\n\nAs if your heart,\n\n\n\nBlood is also dripping......",

    "content": "\"Let's go!\"\n\nThe little loli urged Bai Yingying, pushing her back with her small hands.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nBai Yingying asked back.\n\n\"Your boss is already in the car. We're going to catch someone.\"\n\nBai Yingying then noticed that her boss was already sitting in the car outside the bookstore. Without further ado, she walked out of the bookstore and got into the car.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the back seat, and Bai Yingying followed, sitting with him in the back.\n\nBai Yingying noticed that her boss's complexion wasn't very good, as if someone had just stolen his mountain of gold and silver.\n\nIn fact,\n\nIt was precisely so.\n\nZhou Ze had thought that when he woke up, he could be like the greedy dragons of the West, with women on either side and piles of gold and silver. But dreams were so full, and reality was so thin. When he woke up, all his gold and silver coins had been handed over to the state.\n\nMoreover, he hadn't even received a banner.\n\nNor could he give himself one.\n\nCould the banner read, \"A Youthful and Ambitious Man Hunts Down a Tyrannical Earth God, Eliminating Violence and Bringing Peace to the Region\"?\n\n\"Hey, who's driving?\"\n\nThe little loli sat in the passenger seat and pointed at the empty driver's seat.\n\n\"You drive.\"\n\nZhou Ze said numbly.\n\n\"...\" The little loli.\n\nAfter that, the little loli actually moved to the driver's seat and skillfully started the car. She knew how to drive, and perhaps her actual driving experience was longer than Zhou Ze's. But as soon as the car started, a police car passed by in the distance.\n\nThe little loli quickly moved back to the passenger seat and said helplessly,\n\n\"I can't drive.\"\n\nImagine if they were caught by traffic police while trying to catch someone. And the bookstore was really strange; there had been several incidents due to unlicensed driving.\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head up,\n\nHe didn't notice his surroundings.\n\nHe was just thinking about how, in his previous life, when his hospital organized a trip to Mount Putuo, a monk at a fortune-telling stall there had told him that he \"lacked gold in his five elements.\"\n\nAt the time, he thought the monk was talking nonsense.\n\nNow, looking back,\n\nAlas.\n\n\"Old Taoist, get in the car!\"\n\nThe old Taoist, who was playing with a monkey, heard himself being called and trotted over. He glanced at Zhou Ze and the others in the car, nodded, and obediently sat in the driver's seat.\n\nA furry head popped out from the old Taoist's shoulder. It turned out the little monkey had followed them too.\n\nLeaving a sickly Xu Qinglang to watch the bookstore was enough. After all, they didn't expect much business from the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze was still recovering from his dejection. The little loli, on the other hand, was very invested in this matter. It would be a relief for her if Zhou Ze became a constable sooner. Moreover, this kind of task that earned a lot of merit points was not something that came around often. Therefore, the little loli had mobilized all the available manpower from the bookstore.\n\nIn her words, even if this was like using a machine gun to swat a mosquito, they had to ensure the mosquito was torn to pieces by five horses!\n\nIt was conceivable that if Xu Qinglang hadn't just recovered from a serious illness, and if the death attendants were still flowers of the motherland,\n\nThese two would definitely have been dragged along by the little loli this time.\n\nWhen the car entered the Jianghai Avenue elevated road, Zhou Ze took a deep breath and finally recovered from the blow of losing his mountains of gold and silver.\n\nLooking at the car packed full of people and monkeys,\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously smiled.\n\nNo matter how eloquently the little loli spoke,\n\nShe couldn't change one fact: she was scared.\n\nAfter the incident in Chengdu last time, the little loli probably had some psychological shadow about catching escaped evil spirits from hell. But she couldn't bear to give up such a great temptation for merit points, so she gathered so many people for courage.\n\nUltimately,\n\nShe was afraid of encountering another Liang Chuan.\n\nHowever, that blind man had gone to Shanghai for more than half a year. Apart from Tang Shi's brief return, there seemed to be no news. Tongcheng wasn't far from Shanghai; it was just over an hour's drive. After all, the two cities faced each other across the river, and it was just across the Sutong Bridge.\n\nBut since the other party hadn't contacted him again, Zhou Ze naturally wouldn't bother to contact him. For them, a peaceful coexistence was enough.\n\nShigang Town was located in Tongzhou District. After getting off the Jianghai Avenue elevated road in Xingren Town, they drove north for half an hour and arrived.\n\nThe little loli immediately took out her ghost messenger's certificate and began to direct the old Taoist to drive according to the specific instructions on it. They didn't drive into the countryside but kept circling the town.\n\nFinally, they stopped in front of a supermarket.\n\nTo be precise, this used to be a supermarket, but it had probably gone out of business. The entrance was tightly shut, and there were no goods inside. There was a second floor with several small rooms, a common layout with a shop below and rooms above.\n\nEveryone got out of the car. Zhou Ze lit a cigarette for himself, then took two steps forward, broke the lock on the supermarket door with his fingernails, and pushed open the supermarket door.\n\nThe interior was not small but was messy and covered in dust. It seemed no one had been there for a long time.\n\n\"Search. The target should be around here. Don't act rashly once you find the target. Call for help first!\"\n\nThe little loli said, holding the ghost messenger's certificate. Then, she looked at Zhou Ze, who was still standing in place, and didn't dare to rush him. She joined the search herself.\n\nThe little monkey on the old Taoist's body immediately darted out and began helping to search.\n\nZhou Ze found it quite amusing that the ghost messenger's certificate could pinpoint the target's exact location so precisely, even more accurately than a Didi ride-hailing map.\n\nFrom a feeling, these evil spirits who had managed to escape from hell were like food delivered to their doorstep, just waiting for ghost messengers from all over to follow the map and go through a simple procedure.\n\nPerhaps this was a change in identity, like the heroes of Mount Liang in the late Northern Song Dynasty, who first fought the imperial court and then, after being pardoned, went to fight those who were once in the same camp.\n\nIt was indeed somewhat similar, except that he had already cleared his identity and become a lackey of the underworld.\n\nHe dropped the cigarette butt and stomped it out with the sole of his shoe.\n\n\"Found it!\"\n\nJust then, the old Taoist's voice came from upstairs.\n\nEveryone immediately rushed up the stairs.\n\nThe old Taoist stood at the door of a room on the second floor and pointed inside, saying,\n\n\"Boss, there's a person lying inside.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and directly said, \"Break the door!\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nBai Yingying took the lead, grabbed both sides of the door with her hands, and with a slight exertion, the entire door was dislodged. Then, she turned and made way for her teammates behind her with the open door.\n\nThe old Taoist let out a heavy breath, feeling that Yingying was truly domineering.\n\nThen,\n\nThe old Taoist walked into the room, took a deep breath, and his face turned green. He immediately gagged on the spot.\n\nThere was indeed a person lying inside. It was a woman. The old Taoist hadn't misjudged from outside the window, but this woman's body looked as if it had been gnawed by something. It was gruesome, and a strong stench permeated the air.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and lightly covered his nose, walked over, and squatted beside the corpse.\n\nThe little loli also came to the side and lifted the female corpse's arm. The bones were visible on her arm. The little loli then dropped it again.\n\n\"How long has she been dead?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"About five days. The weather is hot now, so the body decomposes faster.\"\n\nZhou Ze gently prodded the corpse in front of him with his fingernail, searching for clues, and asked,\n\n\"The timeline doesn't match, or is there a delay in the mission issued by hell?\"\n\nThe little loli shook her head, \"Logically, there shouldn't be a delay.\"\n\n\"Then this guy has been dead for five days.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the tattered arm and noticed a dense pattern of needle marks.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the little loli said, a little confused.\n\n\"Um, I, this humble Taoist, have a question. If this corpse is cremated, does it count as burning it to hell?\"\n\n\"That's not right,\" Zhou Ze frowned. \"There seems to be a problem.\"\n\n\"What problem? Did you find something?\" the little loli immediately asked.\n\n\"If the mission issued by hell has no delay, then this corpse, which has been dead for more than five days, should not be the person we are looking for.\"\n\nAs Zhou Ze spoke, he took out the ghost messenger's certificate and flipped to the wanted poster page.\n\n\"The soul is female, but it's not necessarily the case that the person who possesses a body after coming up is female. There's also a big misconception, which is that not every evil spirit returning to the human world from hell's first action is to find a body to possess and disguise themselves as a living person. They might not have time, they might encounter other accidents, or even, she might still be a soul.\n\nOr...\"\n\n\"Or what?\"\n\n\"Heh, this woman's corpse has been gnawed.\"\n\n\"We saw that too. You mean she was bitten to death by something?\"\n\n\"Probably not. This woman's arm has many needle holes. She should have been a severe drug addict. Although I haven't done a proper examination, based on my experience, she should have died from an overdose.\"\n\n\"But her body?\"\n\n\"Her body was probably discovered by something after she died, and then that thing couldn't wait to eat her corpse.\"\n\nAs Zhou Ze spoke, he stood up,\n\nLicked his lips,\n\nAnd continued,\n\n\"The wounds from being bitten have very small dental marks. It should be a very small animal, much smaller than a cat or a dog.\"\n\n\"Much smaller than a cat or a dog?\"\n\n\"It's a rat,\" the old Taoist immediately said.\n\nThe corpse had been gnawed by rats.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Moreover, judging from the traces on the ground we found after entering, this room hasn't been visited by a pack of rats. Perhaps, there was only one rat that ate the corpse, and that rat gnawed on this corpse for a long time.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the information column on the wanted poster again,\n\n\"According to the wanted poster, this female evil spirit was a drug dealer in life and was caught and shot. Most drug dealers are actually using drug dealing to support their drug addiction.\n\nSo, after enduring the torment of hell and finally returning to the human world, if you were her, what would be the first thing you'd want to do?\"\n\n\"Have a good hit?\" the old Taoist said.\n\n\"But you can't find any drugs immediately, so what do you do?\" Zhou Ze continued to ask.\n\n\"Eat... eat the flesh of a drug addict!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's face immediately changed.\n\n\"Moreover, if the instructions on the ghost messenger's certificate are correct, what it's guiding us to find is not this corpse,\n\nBut the one that ate the flesh,\n\nAnd is still lurking here,\n\nThe possessed,\n\nBig rat!\"",

    "content": "We went to catch a ghost, but ended up catching a rat.\n\nAlthough feeling a bit strange, everyone started searching through every nook and cranny. As for the poor corpse, it was temporarily left there unattended; this wasn't the time to deal with it.\n\nAfter finishing, they could call Zhang Yanfeng and let him handle it. After all, carrying a corpse for cremation and disposal was a troublesome task.\n\nThe bookstore crew came to catch evil spirits, not to work overtime as clean-up crew.\n\nAfter searching for over half an hour, there was still no sign of anything. The place was clean to an outrageous degree, not even a single rat dropping was found.\n\n\"Boss, why don't we just burn this house down?\" the old Taoist suggested.\n\nIf they burned it, it would be a clean sweep, and the rat, wherever it was hiding, would be incinerated.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. It would be best to capture it alive and send it down. That way, the reward would be more substantial.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze extended his right hand, and a wisp of black mist began to rise from his fingertips. His fingernails then pierced the floorboards.\n\nThe black mist started to spread, with one strand drifting towards the little loli, another towards Bai Yingying, and one towards the monkey on the old Taoist.\n\nAnother strand slowly drifted towards the female corpse, swirling around it.\n\nZhou Ze's pupils suddenly constricted.\n\nIt was inside the corpse!\n\n\"Squeak!\"\n\nA hole was torn open in the corpse's belly, and a large rat darted out. The rat's fur was reddish, especially its eyes; those two bean-sized pupils showed a dark luster.\n\nThis meant it could think, possessing intelligence beyond that of a normal rat.\n\nActually, this should have been a very unlucky fellow. Of course, it also depended on luck. Souls escaping from hell faced an awkward situation: their souls would continuously deplete. If they couldn't find a suitable host body, they would dissipate in the mortal realm.\n\nAt that time, Zhou Ze had just found Xu Le, and Xu Le had just been beaten to death with a stick. Zhou Ze possessed him while he was still warm.\n\nThis one, however, could only choose to possess a stray rat. He probably wanted to find a suitable body, but his luck was too bad.\n\n\"Squeak!\"\n\nThe bookstore crew formed a circle, and the rat dared not make any rash moves. But the next moment, the little loli's expression changed drastically, and she said:\n\n\"Be careful, illusion.\"\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe old Taoist immediately knelt on the ground, his expression vacant, clearly having fallen victim.\n\nThe little loli's expression was serious. Although she was fine, she had already shifted her gaze elsewhere, no longer daring to look at the rat. She needed some time to stabilize herself.\n\nBai Yingying closed her eyes and stood still.\n\nThe little monkey scurried onto the old Taoist's shoulder and tapped his head with its little paws. Seeing that the old Taoist remained unresponsive, it surveyed its surroundings before jumping onto Zhou Ze's shoulder, pointing at the rat and letting out a fierce growl.\n\nThe rat's gaze then fixed on Zhou Ze.\n\nIt couldn't hypnotize the monkey, but this person... It was horrified to discover that it couldn't hypnotize him either.\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head slightly. With his right hand, his long fingernails grew out. For Boss Zhou, the greatest trials he had faced since his rebirth were one illusion after another.\n\nNo matter what happened, after experiencing it many times, one could become calm. Moreover, this rat's illusion skills were really not great, compared to what he had experienced before, it was like a minor trick.\n\nZhou Ze walked forward proactively.\n\nThe rat's body began to tremble. It was scared, it was fearful.\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nBut the next moment,\n\nIt suddenly darted forward, trying to find a gap to slip through.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!\"\n\nBut the monkey was faster. It leaped from Zhou Ze's shoulder and instantly grabbed the rat's tail, slamming it backward!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nEven though the little monkey spent its days accompanying the old Taoist on livestreams, eating, drinking, and being cute at the bookstore, it was the reincarnation of a demonic monkey with immeasurable potential. Dealing with a rat possessed by an evil spirit was not a big problem.\n\nAs the rat, thrown onto the floor, prepared to get up,\n\nFive fingernails pierced forward, not directly hitting it, but firmly pinning it down.\n\nCaught!\n\n...\n\nOn the way back, the old Taoist was driving. He kept glancing at the rat in the glass bottle placed before the little loli, still somewhat shaken.\n\nJust now, he had been hypnotized without realizing it. If the boss hadn't been present, he might have truly fallen for the rat's trick.\n\nThe little loli, on the other hand, was overjoyed, constantly tilting and rolling the large glass bottle. Watching the rat being flipped back and forth inside seemed to satisfy some of her morbid curiosity.\n\nThe little monkey remained on Zhou Ze's shoulder, continuously shouting \"squeak squeak squeak,\" as if boasting about how amazing it was before, but no one really paid attention to it.\n\n\"One has been caught. Let's send it to hell at the bookstore first, then catch the next one,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThis was also for safety. Dealing with them one by one, from beginning to end, was more suitable than risking an accident midway and coming up empty-handed.\n\nThe little loli nodded, agreeing with the decision.\n\nThen,\n\nShe took out her ghost messenger badge and looked at it.\n\nAnd then,\n\nHer eyes widened, and a look of surprise appeared on her face.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The male evil spirit from Rugao has moved.\"\n\n\"Where did it go?\"\n\n\"Chongchuan District... South Main Street!\"\n\nWhat a familiar place.\n\nZhou Ze and the old Taoist trembled violently.\n\nHoly cow,\n\nThe bookstore was right there!\n\nCould it be such a coincidence?\n\nPerhaps this male evil spirit was also from Tongcheng in his past life. After finally escaping from hell, he wanted to revisit South Main Street, the city center in the hearts of the old Tongcheng people, to relive old times?\n\nBut things, probably wouldn't be that simple.\n\n\"At the bookstore, there's only Old Xu, right?\" Zhou Ze said through gritted teeth.\n\n\"And... a flower,\" the old Taoist added.\n\n\"Yingying, call the bookstore and tell Old Xu to be careful, to close up for now and be cautious,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately took out her phone and dialed the bookstore.\n\nAfter a while,\n\nBai Yingying replied with a rather grim expression:\n\n\"Boss, no one is answering the bookstore's landline or Miss Xu's mobile phone...\"\n\n...\n\nMask after mask was applied. Although she knew that applying masks at such a frequency had poor absorption effects, Xu Qinglang just wanted to compensate for the debt he owed his skin from within.\n\nAs for how much actual effect it had,\n\nA thousand pieces of gold couldn't buy him happiness, right?\n\nHe had closed the bookstore's doors long ago. The weather was too good today, and South Main Street was too crowded.\n\nHmm,\n\nNot suitable for doing business.\n\nIn his opinion, Old Zhou wouldn't dare ask him, who had just recovered from a serious illness, to work immediately and serve customers.\n\nGentle music played from the stereo.\n\nOld Xu lay in the rocking chair that the old Taoist always favored, gently rocking back and forth.\n\nHe tried not to think about things that made him unhappy,\n\nLike housing prices,\n\nLike his master.\n\nSince he had woken up, he should look forward.\n\nHe reached for the red wine he had poured earlier, took a sip, and then put it down, continuing to enjoy the \"illusion\" of his skin being nourished.\n\n\"Knock knock knock!\"\n\nSomeone was knocking on the door.\n\nXu Qinglang sat up impatiently, removed the mask from his face, and glanced outside. He saw a clean-cut young man standing at the door.\n\nThe young man wore a baseball cap and a complete tracksuit. Because it was hot outside, there was a light sheen of sweat, but his bangs were perfectly in place, and his skin was fair, clearly well-maintained.\n\n\"Damn, why is this guy acting so effeminate,\" Xu Qinglang muttered.\n\nThen,\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand at the person at the shop door, signaling that it wasn't open, and then lay back down.\n\nThe knocking on the door indeed stopped. He must have left.\n\nXu Qinglang prepared to apply another mask. As soon as he put it on and closed his eyes.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nHe felt a chill around him. Opening his eyes, he saw a baseball cap appear above him, and then a rope quickly wrapped around his neck.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nXu Qinglang struggled desperately, his hands gripping the rope tightly, but the other party was faster and his strength was more ferocious. If Xu Qinglang's body had recovered, he might have been able to struggle a few more times, but the problem was that he had just woken up from a long period of unconsciousness, and his body was already weak.\n\nBreathing,\n\nHe couldn't breathe.\n\nXu Qinglang kicked his legs incessantly, but the other party was clearly experienced, just holding the rope with both hands and tightening it around the target's neck.\n\n\"Damn it... what is going on...\"\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's rattan chair played a decisive role at this moment.\n\nBecause of its poor quality,\n\nIt broke under the pressure.\n\nXu Qinglang fell from the chair, and the other party, not expecting this turn of events, lost its grip on the rope.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately rolled over on the ground and got up.\n\nBefore he could do anything, a dagger sliced towards him.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nXu Qinglang could only retreat instinctively, but his face also felt a burning pain. Blood soaked into his eyes, causing his vision to turn red.\n\nDamn it,\n\nHe was disfigured!\n\nIn a life-or-death crisis,\n\nXu Qinglang was still concerned about this!\n\nThe other party didn't say much and lunged again. Xu Qinglang leaned back, intending to get away from the counter, but the other party was faster. They pounced and fell to the ground with Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang punched towards the other party's temple, hitting it squarely. The other party trembled, but the next moment, the other party's left hand grabbed Xu Qinglang's arm, and with its right hand, it fiercely plunged the dagger down!\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe entire dagger was embedded in Xu Qinglang's left arm, pinning him to the floor.\n\n\"Ahhh!!!\"\n\nXu Qinglang let out a scream,\n\nAt the same time,\n\nBlood splattered out,\n\nSplashing onto the potted plant placed by the window.\n\nThe already delicate and bright red flowers now appeared even more vibrant and translucent,\n\nEnviable...\n\n\"Ring ring ring... Ring ring ring... Ring ring ring...\"\n\nThe bookstore's landline rang at this moment,\n\nBut there was no one free to answer it.",

    "content": "The old Daoist¹ drove extremely fast, even running a few red lights.\n\nThe atmosphere in the car was also solemn. The little loli leaned against the car window, her eyes half-closed, thinking about who knows what.\n\nBai Yingying clenched her fists, praying in her heart.\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, frowned slightly, his gaze focused.\n\nThe liveliest one was probably the rat that had just been caught. As if sensing the somber mood of everyone in the car, it began to jump about merrily instead.\n\n\"Squeak!!!\"\n\nThe rat flailed in the bottle, its bean-sized eyes filled with a playful glint.\n\n...\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nXu Qinglang lay on the floor, his arm pierced by a dagger and pinned to the floor, making it difficult to move. Any slight tug sent a piercing pain through him.\n\nThe person in the baseball cap sat down beside Xu Qinglang, took off his hat, and ran his fingers over Xu Qinglang's body.\n\n\"A truly... healthy body.\"\n\nThe other person's voice was a little hoarse, and there was an undisguised envy in his words.\n\n\"I want your body, I really want it, so badly...\"\n\nThe man lowered his head and licked the wound on Xu Qinglang's arm. The fresh blood entered his throat, causing him to let out a moan of enjoyment, as if he were tasting fine wine.\n\nThen,\n\nHe began to pant heavily.\n\nLying on the floor, right next to Xu Qinglang, he gasped for air, as if he couldn't breathe, his expression one of great pain.\n\n\"Huff... huff... huff...\"\n\nHe shakily took out a medicine bottle from his pocket, retrieved a few red pills, and then stuffed them all into his mouth, forcing himself to swallow.\n\nThe panting continued but began to slowly subside.\n\nThe man was drenched in sweat, but he had finally gotten through this ordeal.\n\n\"Why, why did the body I entered have to be a terminally ill patient?\"\n\nThe man muttered to himself.\n\nHe didn't waste any more time, nor did he kill Xu Qinglang directly. Instead, he grabbed some rope, tied Xu Qinglang's hands behind his back, and then pulled out the dagger.\n\nNext, he took the red wine Xu Qinglang had been drinking earlier from the bar counter and took a large gulp.\n\nSeeing Xu Qinglang looking pale from blood loss and lying motionless on the floor,\n\nThe man smiled and poured the wine directly onto Xu Qinglang's wound.\n\n\"Ahhhh!!!\"\n\nXu Qinglang let out a scream.\n\nThe pain was no less than salt being rubbed into the wound!\n\n\"Heh heh, scream louder. If you can scream, it means you're not dead.\" The man took another large gulp of red wine. \"I'm at such a disadvantage. I finally escaped from hell, only to enter the body of a sick man. Honestly, I've seen his family's critical illness notice. He doesn't have long to live. Bastard!\"\n\nThe man cursed, not sure who he was cursing. Perhaps, he himself didn't know who he should be cursing.\n\n\"But I also know that even if I don't have long to live, the local ghost messengers² won't let me go. They'll think I still have some use, and they'll want to send me back to hell to collect a generous reward!\n\nSo,\n\nI found my way here proactively. I figured, rather than wait for them to catch me, I'd go find them myself.\n\nI've had enough of living like a rat.\n\nBut I'm not lucky, and there's only you in the shop.\n\nHey, even though you're an ordinary person, I assume you understand what I mean, right?\n\nBecause you're also in this bookstore.\"\n\nXu Qinglang gritted his teeth, \"When they come back, you're dead.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nA smile appeared on the man's lips. Then, he used the dagger to cut open his left palm. Blood immediately flowed out but slowly wriggled in his palm, not dripping down.\n\n\"The suffering I endured in hell all these years wasn't in vain. Do you think I came here just to die?\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nThe blood in his palm flowed back, and the wound healed rapidly.\n\n\"It's hilarious, isn't it? This body, which couldn't live for three months, mutated after I entered it, and this mutation is a terrifying self-healing ability.\n\nHeh heh, this is truly a colossal irony!!!\"\n\nThe man, as if driven mad, repeatedly cut his own face.\n\nSoon,\n\nGruesome scars appeared on his face, but the blood from these wounds wouldn't spill out. Instead, the wounds began to heal quickly, not even leaving a scar.\n\n\"I was initially ecstatic about my self-healing ability, thinking it was a change in my soul after being tormented in hell. When I finally escaped from hell, this was the benefit my suffering had given me.\n\nI thought I was a vampire, capable of a long lifespan, allowing me to fully enjoy life in the mortal world and its splendors.\n\nBut I only have three months to live, only three months!\n\nAnd I,\n\nCannot switch bodies again!\"\n\nThe man roared incessantly.\n\nThe stark contrast between his hopes and reality was indeed enough to drive someone insane.\n\nAt this moment, the potted plant behind the two of them began to tremble slightly, so slightly it was almost imperceptible.\n\nThe flower slowly rose, and from beneath the soil of the large potted plant, a white hand slowly emerged.\n\nThe hand, protruding from the soil of the potted plant and passing through the flower's pistil, stretched out a horrifying three meters like a ghost, a distance no ordinary person's arm could extend.\n\nThe hand silently reached the man's back,\n\nAnd then,\n\nGrasped him!\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nThe man felt a huge force grip his neck, and then he was dragged backward across the floor.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man hit the wall,\n\nBut at this moment, the man opened his mouth, and two fangs appeared.\n\nAt first glance, his fangs were similar to Zhou Ze's, but in reality, they were thinner and sharper, lacking the ruggedness of Zhou Ze's fangs.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nNot just these two fangs, but if one looked closely at the man's other teeth, they were all incredibly sharp, like two rows of small saws interlocking above and below.\n\nThese terrifyingly sharp teeth frequently pierced the man's mouth, making his voice hoarse when he spoke, and causing him to constantly suffer the pain of torn skin and flesh in his mouth, but his terrifying self-healing ability could quickly restore everything.\n\nThe hand began to thrash, trying to break free from the man's fangs, but the man, like a caterpillar, held onto the hand tightly with both hands and feet.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nThe potted plant cracked,\n\nThe flowers withered,\n\nThe leaves fell,\n\nThe soil scattered.\n\nInside,\n\nThere was a tumor-like mass, like a giant heart, constantly beating. And this extremely long hand had emerged from the tumor.\n\nXu Qinglang, lying on the ground with his head turned, his hands tied behind his back, couldn't even stand up. He could only watch the tumor, which had transformed into a death servant³, battle the man.\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nThe dagger in the man's hand slashed,\n\nThe death servant's hand was severed, and the man collapsed to the ground. But after a moment, the man charged towards the tumor.\n\n\"Heh heh, there's something interesting here!\"\n\nThe tumor began to roll, as if evading the man. It seemed it hadn't finished growing yet.\n\nBut it remembered the mission it was given,\n\nWhich was to clear out everything in this house that belonged to trash.\n\nAnd the man before it,\n\nBelonged to the category of trash in its eyes.\n\nBut no matter how fast the tumor rolled, it couldn't match the man's speed. The man rushed forward, grabbed the tumor with one hand, and the tumor quickly secreted a corrosive liquid similar to sulfuric acid from within.\n\nThe man's hand began to dissolve rapidly, but the man showed no fear, not even caring about the pain. He looked at the tumor in front of him as if it were a treasure.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nHe lowered his head, opened his mouth, and bit down!\n\nThe tumor began to tremble incessantly. Beneath its dirty, wrinkled surface was tender red flesh, with dark golden fluid flowing within. This was the inner essence of the death servant, and the man was greedily devouring it.\n\nHe had a premonition,\n\nThat if he ate this thing, he wouldn't die. His lifespan would be extended, and this damned terminal illness could be resolved.\n\nAt that time,\n\nHe would take this person as a hostage. If he could exchange it for a ghost messenger pass to clear his name, that would be best. If not, at least it would give him a chance to escape.\n\nHe wanted to escape.\n\nHe absolutely had to escape!\n\nBefore, he thought he didn't have much time left, so he might as well go out with a bang. But now that there was hope of survival, he began to consider his fallback plan.\n\nXu Qinglang, kneeling on the ground, began to chant a spell.\n\nBefore, he had no chance to retaliate. The other party wouldn't give him a chance to chant.\n\nBut now,\n\nHe had it.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth, boundless, Xuan Xin True Method!\"⁴\n\nA talisman slowly slid out from Xu Qinglang's chest, emitting a faint glow.\n\nImmediately,\n\nWith a \"whoosh,\"\n\nThe talisman shot out,\n\nSticking directly onto the man's back.\n\n\"Ahhhh!!!\"\n\nThe man's body trembled, and he let out a roar, turning his head with an angry gaze to look at Xu Qinglang lying on the ground.\n\n\"You're looking for death!\"\n\nXu Qinglang grinned, bloodstains still dripping from his mouth.\n\nA single talisman,\n\nIndeed, couldn't kill him.\n\nHis cultivation,\n\nWas still too weak.\n\nThe man picked up the dagger.\n\n\"Heh, I'll kill you first, you little rascal!\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nThe man turned and walked towards Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nHowever,\n\nThe tumor, which he had just bitten a large hole into, suddenly opened like the giant maw of a shark, rapidly expanding like an inflated balloon.\n\nThe man felt darkness envelop him,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nHis entire upper body was swallowed by this giant tumor.\n\nIf Zhou Ze were here, he would probably recognize that,\n\nThis action,\n\nWas exactly the same as how the potted plant helped him eat mosquitoes two months ago.\n\nOnly the man's legs were left kicking outside.\n\nThe man's pained screams echoed from within the tumor.\n\nSouth Street,\n\nStill bustling with crowds,\n\nBut no one noticed,\n\nWhat was happening in this bookstore at this very moment.\n\n---\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ **Daoist (道士 - dào shì):** Refers to a practitioner of Taoism, a Chinese philosophy and religion.

    "content": "The car skidded, a stunt like in a cop movie, half its body on the sidewalk, the rear bumper millimeters from the fire hydrant.\n\nThe old Daoist swallowed, letting out a long sigh.\n\nBai Yingying, the little loli, and Zhou Ze pushed open the car doors and rushed into the bookstore at top speed.\n\nInside the bookstore,\n\nThe air was thick with the smell of blood.\n\nXu Qinglang sat leaning against the wall, still bleeding, his face as pale as paper. If not for the slight rise and fall of his chest with each breath, everyone would have worried he had croaked.\n\nA strange man sat behind the bar.\n\nThe man had fair skin, but was covered in various dirty, disgusting fluids, looking as if he'd just crawled out of a vat of sauce.\n\nAs Zhou Ze and the others entered,\n\nThe man slowly raised his head.\n\nHe bared his teeth,\n\nHis blade-like teeth exuding an unusual chilling aura,\n\nHis blood-red eyes fell directly on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze looked back, his eyes narrowing slowly.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nThe man slammed the table,\n\nFlipping over the bar with a swift motion,\n\nHis legs dug into the ground as he landed,\n\nAnd he lunged towards Zhou Ze at incredible speed.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move.\n\nBecause Bai Yingying, standing beside him, stepped forward, bracing herself with both hands, and grabbed the man. With a twist of her waist, Yingying, in an extremely exaggerated, tomboyish pose, slammed the man hard onto the ground.\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe ceramic tiles began to crack.\n\nZhou Ze frowned,\n\nFeeling a bit resentful towards Bai Yingying.\n\nThis was their place;\n\nDidn't broken floor tiles cost money to replace?\n\nHowever, the man, after being slammed to the ground, quickly got back up. He attempted to bypass Bai Yingying and charge at Zhou Ze again. In his eyes, only Zhou Ze seemed to exist.\n\nBai Yingying, of course, wouldn't let him succeed.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nYingying shattered a chair beside her with her right hand, gripping a steel pipe from its interior.\n\nThe moment the chair broke,\n\nZhou Ze's frown deepened.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe steel pipe made a piercing whistling sound in Bai Yingying's hand. The man, who had just rounded Bai Yingying, took the heavy blow on his back, causing his spine to visibly cave in.\n\n\"Crash!\"\n\nThe man crashed into the bar counter, the exquisitely designed, stylish counter, along with the red wine, coffee, and cups on it, scattering across the floor.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nIf they continued fighting,\n\nThe entire place would be demolished.\n\n\"Hurry it up.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\n\"Got it, Boss!\"\n\nWhile the man was still lying on the bar counter, not yet risen,\n\nYingying tossed the steel pipe in her hand upwards, then gripped it again and thrust it directly towards the man's chest!\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nThe steel pipe pierced the man's chest and stuck into the floor.\n\nBut even like this,\n\nThe man, pinned to the ground, continued to flail, his eyes fixed on Zhou Ze.\n\nThe old Daoist, seizing the pause in the fight, rushed to Xu Qinglang's side, checked his injuries, and then quickly signaled the little monkey beside him to pee, needing to mix it with mud to heal Xu Qinglang.\n\nMonkey urine mixed with mud was as good as the best hemostatic plaster.\n\nZhou Ze scanned the entire bookstore, feeling like something was missing, but couldn't recall what.\n\nBecause that thing had always been insignificant, and now it was even more so.\n\nAfter thinking for a long time,\n\nWhen Zhou Ze saw the shattered glass tank in the corner, he finally remembered.\n\nWhere had the Death Warrior with grass growing from its head gone?\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nXu Qinglang, who had been on the verge of fainting from blood loss, was jolted awake by the old Daoist applying the monkey urine and mud to his wound. He blinked open his eyes, looking around at the people present with confusion, and finally looked at the man pinned to the ground by a steel pipe, weakly saying,\n\n\"Death Warrior... swallow him.\"\n\n\"So, this is the Death Warrior?\"\n\nThe little loli squatted beside the man, reached out, and tapped his forehead, continuing,\n\n\"So, when he lunged at you just now, he wanted a hug and to call you Daddy?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"And then, you let your maid beat him up, and not only that, but she impaled him on the ground?\"\n\nThe little loli glanced at Bai Yingying again.\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying.\n\nThe little loli shook her head and patted the Death Warrior's face. The Death Warrior didn't bite the little loli and even cooperated by showing a wronged expression, tears welling up in its eyes.\n\n\"Poor child. Finally grew out, got a body, saw his father, and was overjoyed.\n\nBut now he's like this.\n\nThe father is so cruel.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over, grabbed the little loli's ponytail, and lifted it up.\n\n\"Hey, what are you doing!\n\nBe careful, I'll sue you for child abuse!\"\n\nZhou Ze flung the little loli aside and squatted down beside the Death Warrior himself.\n\nWith the steel pipe piercing his chest, the Death Warrior couldn't move, but he still rubbed his forehead against Zhou Ze's shoe as hard as he could.\n\nZhou Ze felt a mixture of amusement and helplessness.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze carefully noticed that new skin was visibly growing at the Death Warrior's wound.\n\nThis astonishing recovery ability was truly shocking. Zhou Ze had been a surgeon in his past life, and postoperative recovery was often a major headache for doctors.\n\n\"Boss, this...\"\n\nBai Yingying stood to the side like a child who had done something wrong.\n\n\"He should be fine. Pull it out.\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nZhou Ze stood up and moved a short distance away.\n\nHe didn't want bloodstains on his clothes.\n\nFor someone with mysophobia, it was best to remain as clean as possible unless absolutely necessary.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, grabbed the steel pipe, and pulled it out.\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\n\nThe Death Warrior sat up abruptly, arms spread, his body twitching spasmodically in a grotesque manner.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe wound on his chest began to be covered by flesh and skin. Although there was still a slight indentation, this recovery could only be described as astonishing.\n\nThis time, he had learned his lesson. After standing up, he didn't dare to lunge at Zhou Ze again, but quietly stood beside him.\n\n\"Go back to your original spot. Also, old Daoist!\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss!\"\n\nThe old Daoist had just finished treating Xu Qinglang's injuries.\n\n\"In the afternoon, take the Death Warrior to buy some new clothes and some materials to repair this place.\"\n\n\"Alright, Boss.\"\n\nDamn, how stingy!\n\nThe little loli held the glass bottle and tapped it lightly. The rat inside had lost its former spirited look.\n\n\"Where's the soul?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, indicating he didn't know.\n\nJust then, the Death Warrior in the corner opened his mouth, spitting out a cloud of black mist. Instantly, the temperature in the bookstore, without any air conditioning, dropped several degrees.\n\nThe malevolent ghost, upon escaping, immediately tried to flee.\n\n\"Trying to leave?\"\n\nThe little loli's tongue shot out, binding the ghost.\n\n\"The Underworld has order...\"\n\nForcing herself to interrupt her rhythm, the little loli dared not send the ghost to hell herself. Instead, she bound it with her tongue and brought it before Zhou Ze.\n\nIf she sent it down, she would get the larger share of merit points, and Zhou Ze would get the smaller share.\n\nBai Yingying saw this, pouted, and secretly scorned the little loli in her heart.\n\nHeh,\n\nA woman.\n\nA outwardly cold, inwardly hot type!\n\nIn the end, she's still sucking up to our boss!\n\nZhou Ze extended his fingernail and grabbed the ghost.\n\nThe ghost was covered in wounds, but its soul was still strong, carrying extremely dense resentment.\n\nThose who escaped from hell were no ordinary beings.\n\n\"You and I are actually the same!\"\n\nThe ghost roared.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nIn reality, he was a bit special.\n\nActually,\n\nThis malevolent ghost was similar to Liang Chuan and Tang Shi.\n\nThose two had also escaped from hell. Their current soul forms were also in a similarly gruesome, mangled state.\n\nBut one had been whitewashed, and the other hadn't.\n\nIf they were recruited, they were the imperial army;\n\nIf not, they were bandits.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, his fingernail drew a circle, and a dark, black gate of hell opened. Zhou Ze pushed the malevolent ghost into it.\n\nThen,\n\nThe gate of hell did not close. Zhou Ze turned and looked at the rat in the glass bottle.\n\nWith a \"snap,\"\n\nThe little loli's tongue shattered the glass bottle, sending shards of glass scattering across the floor.\n\nZhou Ze, standing nearby, unconsciously licked his lips.\n\nHe wondered how the little loli had developed such tongue skills.\n\nDidn't she fear pain?\n\nThe rat was flicked by her tongue and instantly died, a wisp of black smoke rising from its body. The little loli bound it again with her tongue and presented it to Zhou Ze.\n\nVery obedient,\n\nVery docile,\n\nLike a well-bathed child, dressed in a uniform, with lubricant and condoms already provided,\n\nLying on your bed voluntarily,\n\nAnd even preparing hot water in the bathtub for you.\n\nBai Yingying puffed out her cheeks.\n\nSo annoying!\n\nThis was a female ghost, her soul form appearing equally tragic.\n\n\"Let me... let me take one more hit before I go down!\n\nJust one hit!\n\nIf you let me take one more hit, I'll do anything you want, really!\"\n\nZhou Ze chuckled, speechless.\n\nWas this addiction really that terrifying?\n\nEven after death, becoming a ghost,\n\nThey couldn't quit?\n\n\"Next life, don't do drugs, if you have one.\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nZhou Ze directly threw her into the gate of hell.\n\nThen,\n\nThe gate of hell vanished into nothingness.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nLetting out a long breath,\n\nBoss Zhou eagerly took out his ghost messenger certificate.\n\nAlthough he had been slacking off,\n\nEvery slacker dreams of getting rich by basking in the sun every day.\n\nIndeed,\n\nThe merit points bar shot up, and the increase was astonishing.\n\n521/1000!\n\nIt increased by two hundred!\n\nUsually, escorting a soul to hell only gave four or five merit points, and it depended on luck, often with days passing without any souls appearing.\n\nThis was freaking amazing;\n\nMalevolent ghosts were a hundred and one points!\n\nThat meant capturing five more,\n\nAnd he'd meet the requirements for a captain of investigators in terms of merit points!\n\nFor a moment,\n\nZhou the Slacker's eyes flickered with a hint of fire.\n\nThis was the fire of fighting spirit!\n\nBoss Zhou had never felt this way before,\n\nEager to catch ghosts,\n\nAnd contribute his part to a harmonious society!",

    "content": "Zhou Ze took out his phone, preparing to call Liu Chuyu.\n\nSince there were stray malevolent spirits here in Tongcheng, there was a high probability of them being in Changzhou as well.\n\nAlthough this subordinate, whom he had taken in by chance, didn't send greetings during festivals or offer any gifts of filial respect,\n\nZhou Ze was a magnanimous person, and helping others was his life principle.\n\nTherefore, he planned to proactively go to Changzhou to see if there was anything he could do to help.\n\nAfter all, as long as malevolent spirits lingered in the secular world, they posed a continuous hidden danger to the construction of a harmonious society.\n\nAs a law-abiding, tax-paying, good citizen, Boss Zhou felt he was duty-bound in such matters.\n\n\"I'm sorry, the number you have dialed is switched off. Please try again later...\"\n\nPutting down his phone,\n\nZhou Ze said with some surprise,\n\n\"He might have run into some trouble, his phone is off.\"\n\n\"Maybe he just blocked you,\"\n\nthe little loli added from the side, taking a jab.\n\nOf course,\n\nthis was just a joke.\n\nAfter all, Liu Chuyu's soul blood was still with Zhou Ze, meaning his life was in Zhou Ze's hands. If he dared to mess around with his own life, Zhou Ze would truly have to admire him.\n\nA white sedan stopped in front of the bookstore. A woman in a black dress stepped out, with long, flowing hair and a graceful figure, complemented by an enviable aura. Many passersby turned their attention to her, regardless of whether they were with their girlfriends.\n\nThe little loli nudged Zhou Ze with her hand and gestured outside the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bookstore door and walked out.\n\nThe sun was blazing outside, and the road was scorched \"crispy.\" Director Lin, however, seemed unfazed. She wasn't looking at the situation inside the bookstore, nor did it seem like she was waiting for Zhou Ze. Instead, she was observing the renovation progress of the pharmacy next door.\n\nThe pharmacy was almost finished with its renovations; even the sign was hung. The design style was very high-end. It looked less like a pharmacy and more like a high-class private clinic. However, whether it had the qualifications and operating licenses would depend on Dr. Lin pulling some strings.\n\nIn fact, setting aside the potential trouble Zhou Ze might face by practicing medicine himself, opening a small private clinic shouldn't be too difficult for Director Lin. Otherwise, how could so many Putian-系的 hospitals[1] have opened?\n\n\"You're here.\"\n\nBoss Zhou started with a pointless statement.\n\nDirector Lin nodded.\n\nThen, Boss Zhou said another pointless statement,\n\n\"Have you eaten?\"\n\n...\n\nBy the glass door of the bookstore, the little loli and Bai Yingying, two girls, one big and one small, stood side by side.\n\nThe little loli had her arms crossed.\n\nBai Yingying also had her arms crossed.\n\nAt this moment, the two women shared a similar aura.\n\n\"So, he was a bachelor in his past life too?\"\n\nThe little loli looked at the cute, simple zombie next to her.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, \"Boss was in his thirties in his past life and wasn't married.\"\n\n\"Logically, a department head at a hospital, and a renowned surgeon at that, should be very sought after. Both in terms of career development and social status, he should be attractive to the opposite sex, and that persona would also be liked by mothers-in-law.\n\nIt's truly not easy for him to remain single under such favorable conditions.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Pfft... You're here, have you eaten...\"\n\nThe little loli mimicked Zhou Ze's tone and manner, and then couldn't help but laugh herself.\n\n\"Single by choice, can't afford to offend, can't afford to offend.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I was just passing by, so I wanted to see how the renovation of this pharmacy was progressing. It looks like it's almost done.\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\n\"In a few days, I'll arrange for a small team of medical staff to come over. I'll handle the operating licenses and such. If you feel like practicing medicine, you can come play around in there. I'll set up an operating room for you, with first-class equipment. As for your medical license, I'll get you one, maybe a traditional Chinese medicine one.\n\nI believe, with your skills, there won't be any problems, at least no medical malpractice.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Since they had already renovated the pharmacy, refusing would seem a bit awkward.\n\nMoreover,\n\nwith Boss Zhou's current special ability to capture wandering souls,\n\nbeing a doctor would be like having a cheat code.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly noticed someone else sitting in Director Lin's car.\n\nThe person was wearing a wine-red suit and sunglasses, sitting in the back seat and looking at his phone. He was about forty years old, and everything from his wrist to his shoes were high-end items, displaying the taste of a successful man of his age.\n\nThe person seemed to sense Zhou Ze's gaze, took off his sunglasses, revealing a pair of deep eyes, and smiled and nodded at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze narrowed his eyes.\n\nHe seemed to remember he wasn't divorced.\n\nAlthough their marital relationship was nominal, even practically dead, and just a slip of the hand away from ending,\n\nit hadn't ended yet, right?\n\nEven if it had ended,\n\nseeing an ex-girlfriend or ex-wife with another man and being able to sincerely bless them,\n\nsuch a person must be hypocritical to the extreme.\n\n\"This is Lawyer An. Our hospital and his law firm recently established a cooperative relationship, and Lawyer An has been handling several medical malpractice cases for us recently, and he's done a very thorough job.\"\n\nDirector Lin introduced Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Lawyer An, this is my husband, Xu Le.\"\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\nThe other party nodded slightly at Zhou Ze, adding,\n\n\"A match made in heaven.\"\n\nThat was quite a forced compliment.\n\nIf they were both wearing casual clothes and walking dogs in the neighborhood, being praised as \"a match made in heaven\" might be understandable, as Xu Le was also good-looking.\n\nWhen Director Lin's parents chose Xu Le as their live-in son-in-law back then, it was partly because his parents had passed away,\n\npartly because he had a weak personality,\n\nand the third, and most important reason, was that he was quite handsome.\n\nBut now, standing next to an ambitious urban career woman,\n\nwas a \"kept man\" who only ran a money-losing bookstore.\n\nTo say \"a match made in heaven\" now,\n\nfelt rather ironic.\n\n\"Shall we have dinner together?\" Director Lin invited Zhou Ze.\n\nLawyer An shrugged, looking somewhat disappointed,\n\n\"It seems I've lost the chance to have dinner with a beauty.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't refuse. He got into the passenger seat and called out to the two \"stone-waiting-for-husband\" figures standing at the bookstore entrance,\n\n\"Going out to discuss some work.\"\n\nOf course,\n\nthe two \"stone-waiting-for-husband\" figures automatically ignored this remark,\n\nand instead, both let out a snort,\n\n\"Heh,\n\nmen.\"\n\n...\n\nDinner was at a high-end restaurant in the development zone. The dishes were decent, not amazing, and the decor was okay, but it lacked much character.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nthe only distinctive feature was the waitstaff. The women wore uniforms with short skirts, resembling office ladies or students just off work. Every time they served a dish, they were very respectful, with perfect service attitudes.\n\nThis place was chosen by Lawyer An; he specifically picked this one.\n\nHalfway through the meal, Director Lin put down her chopsticks and apologized, saying she needed to go to the restroom, then left her seat.\n\nLawyer An winked at Zhou Ze, wiped his mouth with a napkin, and asked, pointing at the dishes in front of them,\n\n\"How do they taste?\"\n\n\"They're alright,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had been observing him from the beginning. Initially, it was out of an instinct to scrutinize any unfamiliar person getting close to his \"mother ape,\"\n\nbut then,\n\nit turned into curiosity.\n\nThis was a very charismatic middle-aged man; every move of his exemplified this.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, with his experience of two lives, couldn't achieve this. Firstly, it was a matter of age, and secondly, Boss Zhou had never experienced a rich man's life.\n\nSome things could be surpassed through effort, but some things could only be achieved by spending money.\n\n\"How has Mr. Xu's business been recently?\" Lawyer An asked.\n\n\"It's been alright. I've just done two good deals.\"\n\n\"Are you referring to selling two books?\"\n\nLawyer An chuckled at his own remark. Then, he pointed at the dishes in front of him and took out a silver card from his pocket, sliding it towards Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I know what Mr. Xu is worried about. Don't worry, I have no such intentions.\n\nAlso,\n\nif Mr. Xu feels that this table of dishes doesn't suit his taste and he hasn't enjoyed himself enough,\n\nyou can use this card to order more dishes.\n\nHowever,\n\nyou cannot bring your wife along.\"\n\n\"Order dishes?\"\n\n\"Yes. The people eating here aren't eating the dishes, but the waitresses who bring them. The last page of the menu lists the dishes and their prices. There are both male and female servers.\n\nI've already picked my 'dish' for tonight. It's getting dark soon, so I'll be taking my leave. Please apologize to Director Lin for me.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nLawyer An picked up his briefcase, snapped his fingers, and a waitress who had just brought a specialty dish over immediately came to carry his briefcase for him. The two of them went straight into the elevator.\n\nLawyer An winked at Zhou Ze again,\n\nand kissed the girl beside him.\n\nZhou Ze played with the silver card in his hand,\n\n\"Where did he go?\"\n\nDirector Lin's voice came from behind.\n\nZhou Ze's fingers suddenly retracted, and the silver card disappeared into his sleeve.\n\nHeh,\n\nmen.\n\n\"He said he was a bit tired and went home to rest. He didn't want to disturb us.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's take a walk together.\"\n\n...\n\nPast three in the morning,\n\nthe sounds of flesh colliding finally ceased in the room.\n\nPeople often say there are only tired bulls, not broken land,\n\nbut land can also become dry and cracked from excessive water loss.\n\n\"Darling, you're amazing. I'm practically dizzy.\"\n\nLawyer An smiled.\n\nHis words were like the little red flowers given to children by a kindergarten teacher;\n\nregardless of their value,\n\nthey were fitting for the occasion.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nLawyer An took out a studded chocolate-flavored condom,\n\ntore open the packaging.\n\n\"Aren't you tired? Don't you want to sleep?\"\n\nThe woman asked in surprise.\n\nEven with medication, she wasn't this energetic.\n\nLawyer An took a deep breath, his eyes slowly filling with bloodshot veins, and said in a low voice,\n\n\"Of course I want to sleep.\n\nIf,\n\nI could still sleep.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nit's all because the person lying next to me is so attractive.\"\n\n---\n[1] Putian-系医院: A term referring to hospitals in China that are often criticized for prioritizing profit over patient care, with a history of controversy surrounding their business practices.",

He only took a shower and left after dawn.\n\n\n\n\"Birds are worse than…...\"\n\n\n\nThe girl called out,\n\n\n\nShe almost passed in the middle of the night\n\n\n\nWhen she slowly sat up and turned to see the thick small piece on the bed cabinet, the original anger on her face suddenly disappeared, and even a smile appeared.\n\n\n\nYou must know,\n\n\n\nThe food was paid when you were in the hotel.\n\n\n\nSo these are all extra small fees, which do not need to be shared with the hotel, and the hotel also defaults to it.\n\n\n\n\"What a bird...\"\n\n\n\n …………\n\n\n\n\"Xiao Ding, you're a minute late\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An said, pointing at his gold watch\n\n\n\n\"Sorry, lawyer, there was a car accident on the elevated road, causing the entire elevated road to be blocked there.\"\n\n\n\nDriver explains the\n\n\n\n\"Oh, okay, then you can start waiting for me here last night.\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An opened the door of the driving room and signaled his driver to come out.\n\n\n\n\"Go and calculate the next month's salary there, and then you can leave in front of me.\"\n\n\n\n\"No...this...\" The driver was obviously a little difficult to accept\n\n\n\nYou should know that the salary of this company is very rich and the benefits are also very good, so he is unwilling to lose this job\n\n\n\n\"Boss, I won't meet next time.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry next time, you won't have the next time. I really want to give you a look like someone who doesn't have time to watch.

In fact, some places seem a bit relaxed, at least, there is no such a killing atmosphere.\n\n\n\nLawyer An sat down in front of the glass window, placed his briefcase on the desktop, and took out a thick stack of documents from it.The surroundings are\n\n\n\nHe took two deep breaths.\n\n\n\nPeople often say that Rongcheng is a comfortable and leisurely city.\n\n\n\nBut that is just the entertainment communication from the outside world.\n\n\n\nTake a look at the urban population that Chengdu has now entered and the streets that are blocking cars all day long.\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the small area that was stuffed with the living density of Hong Kong’s “bee coal” that year.\n\n\n\nA leisurely city,\n\n\n\nI really saw the leisurely and leisure of ghosts\n\n\n\nAlthough this Tongcheng is located in the long triangle economic development area, it is really leisurely. It is so leisurely that there is a poisonous person in front of me that he succeeded in \"violating\" while awaiting trial in court.\n\n\n\n  It is enough to see that Tongcheng is much more comfortable than Chengdu\n\n\n\nThe iron door opposite was opened,\n\n\n\nLawyer An put away his thoughts. In fact, he was still a little homesick, but for the sake of the business he had planned for half a year ago, he deliberately started a new company in Tongcheng to do a plan.\n\n\n\nThe other party was a thin middle-aged man. He slowly sat down in front of Lawyer An.\n\n\n\nEyes,\n\n\n\nSome are heavy\n\n \n\nLawyer An urged a finger, picked up the tube, and said to the tube \"Hey, hey, feed...\"\n\n\n\nThe other party's eyes became even more intense\n\n\n\n\"Can you hear it?\" Lawyer An pointed to the finger\n\n\n\nThe other party silently picked up the phone and said:\n\n\n\n\"We can hear it without vocalizing it.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, I really like this kind of erotic feel, iron windows, glass, telephone,\n\n\n\nPlus the red words \"Remove it well and report to the society\" on the wall,\n\n\n\nThis kind of sensation,\n\n\n\nIt's a kind of beauty\"\n\n\n\n\"You are beautiful, but you didn't tell me in advance, and you actually let me possess a prisoner.\"\n\n\n\nThe other party held the tube tightly in his hand and gritted his teeth and said incisor.\n\n\n\nThe originally calm face looked a little dirty at this time\n\n\n\n\"Please control your emotions. I will cover up your breath, but if your emotions get out of control, the ghost messenger's ghost messenger can lock your breath\n\n\n\n  then,\n\n\n\nYou'll be GG\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An puts his hands on it,\n\n\n\n\"The police here are much more lovely than ghosts, what do you think?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's just a ghost man.\" The other party didn't care much\n\n\n\n\"Huh......You know, just yesterday, two evil spirits who escaped with you were arrested, and they were all sent back directly.\"\n\n\n\nLanguage,\n\n\n\nThe other party's body suddenly fucked.\n\n\n\nObviously,\n\n\n\n  go back,\n\n\n\nThese two words,\n\n\n\nHe said he had a great sense of fear\n\n\n\n\"The area of Tongcheng has become a bit evil this year. Last night, I accidentally ate with this local ghost messenger.\"\n\n\n\n\"You actually give me a gift for eating with the ghost messenger.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no, you don't understand, that guy, it's not simple\"\n\n\n\n\"Where is not simple\"\n\n\n\n\"I looked at the face and saw that his wife was still there.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” The man “You are teasing me very much”\n\n\n\n\"The silly\" lawyer An said, \"Sorry, other than that, I can't find out that even if he is not simple, I think this is where he is really not simple.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to hear your words\"\n\n\n\n\"This is not a waste, but a warning. You know why I like to let my customers possess them in the prison because I also need to do a survey and evaluation to see if my customers' brains are tortured into mental retardation in the local area.\n\n\n\nIf it is the same as that kind of crazy dog,\n\n\n\nAs soon as you come out, it's like a penis that Changsheng wants to take a bite.\n\n\n\nI just had to take care of them\n\n\n\n  and,\n\n\n\nLet me say it again, if it is Changzhou or Suzhou here, it is nothing to say, but in Tongcheng, you have to give me a good attitude. My vision of people will not be wrong, that guy is not easy to mess with.\"\n\n\n\nThe other party took a deep breath and opened his mouth:\n\n\n\n\"I can understand how you run, I can even understand the fact that you led me to possess the prisoner and prevent me from being free.\n\n\n\nBut what I can't tolerate is,\n\n\n\nWhy is this one I possessed a strong, traitor, traitor, traitor,\n\n\n\nDo you know that this character has no status in the prison, and will be bullied by other prisoners in the city every day?\n\n\n\nI still can’t use my ability to be afraid of breath leakage, and I still have to endure it.”\n\n\n\n\"Even if those prisoners have opened your back door countless times, they have played the drought roads in their blood several times,\n\n\n\nCompared with the punishments in the yard,\n\n\n\nThis can be considered enjoyable\n\n\n\nAlso, who told this goods to be ready to die?\n\n\n\nIf he doesn't die, I have no place to give you a trek.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you want to come and try?\"\n\n\n\n\"We'll tell you right. I need you to stay here for another week. During this week, I need to make a new assessment of you to determine whether our business cooperation can move to the next step. You must show me well in this week.\n\n\n\n  Renovate well,\n\n\n\nBecome a new person,\n\n\n\nBe a socially useful person\n\n\n\nAfter passing my assessment, the sentence of this guy is almost over. I will arrange for you to get out and then send you to where you want to go.\"\n\n\n\n  \"I see\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, now our cooperation has entered the second stage, so we have to give me the money in the second stage first.\"\n\n\n\n\"Things are not over yet\"\n\n\n\n\"We can end the money now. You can go back to prison and face those friends, or you can try to use your abilities to excite yourself. Then I hope to see how the ghost man in Tongcheng repaired you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll give it to you\"\n\n\n\n\"That's right, come here, press a fingerprint\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking,\n\n\n\nLawyer An put a paper of contract on the glass\n\n\n\nThe other party pressed it under the glass\n\n\n\nThere is nothing on the paper.\n\n\n\n  but,\n\n\n\nThere will be some,\n\n\n\nBecause it is not a finger mark when left on it.\n\n\n\nBut the soul seal\n\n\n\n\"Life is not easy. It's not easy to make any fortune in this age.\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An yawned, and asked casually:\n\n\n\n\"What's new in the supervisor?\"\n\n\n\n\"The author of the sect has published another book, and he has been sentenced to two times for this.\"\n\n\n\n  \"hehe\"\n\n\n\n\"I feel very uncomfortable when I look at that guy, and I am aloof, like those civil servants in the borough who come to record the number of sentences every day.\"\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An suddenly pressed his hands on the glass.\n\n\n\nThe face was almost pasted.\n\n\n\nSome twisted tracks:\n\n\n\n\"Mom, if you dare to touch him, you will be unable to get this local scammer friend. I will be the one who will kill you by myself.\n\n\n\n  No,\n\n\n\nI will eliminate harm to the people.\n\n\n\nSend you, the bastard, back to the ground.\"\n\n\n\n\"How......\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't let go of your thoughts just now, otherwise, you want to die and don't drag me down and be in trouble with me.\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An sat back on the chair.\n\n\n\n  The prisoner pointed to the opposite side,\n\n\n\n\"If you have nothing to do, read the book, look at other people's books, see how high their thinking is, you can also shout the verbs, and you don't have money to shout, and don't shout it out.\"\n\n\n\n\"I understand\"\n\n\n\n\"If you can live naturally in the supervisor, it means that after you go out, you can live as usual without causing trouble for me, understand.\"\n\n\n\n\"I understand\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, I have to go to Changzhou tonight, and there is still a customer waiting for me, we'll see you next week.\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An stood up and walked out of the prison room\n\n\n\nThere will be a violent storm every two or three years.\n\n\n\nMost evil spirits are like monsters without background in \"The Westward Journey\", and the next scene can only be beaten to death by Sun Wukong.\n\n\n\nAnd the monster with background, Sun Wukong, dared not kill him, but was taken away by the protective gurus behind him. Sun Wukong could only shout \"Go away\" with his hand\n\n\n\nHe is actually one of this type of protection.\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\n\n\nHe is looking at the other party's property\n\n\n\nBut business can only be considered as a good idea. There are many ghosts with money, but there are too few who can even grit their teeth and get out of violence.\n\n\n\n                                          \n\n\n\nWalked into the smoking room in the prison,\n\n\n\nLawyer An first clicked a smoke\n\n\n\nThere happened to be a policeman who had just changed shifts. One of them looked at him and said with a smile:\n\n\n\n\"You are a lawyer.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Um\"\n\n\n\n\"You have earned a lot by being a lawyer.\"\n\n\n\n  \"It's not bad\"\n\n\n\nThe policeman left after smoking\n\n\n\nLawyer An spit out a smoke ring.\n\n\n\nTake out a piece of the slightest slab that just entered your pocket when signing a contract.\n\n\n\nVery thick sliver,\n\n\n\nPut it in front of you and try it with your fingers.\n\n\n\nA small slight wind browsed over my face.\n\n\n\n“This is the world,\n\n\n\nThe gentlest and most comfortable style”",

    "title": "Chapter 318 Changzhou",
    "content": "A food street in Changzhou, with few working streetlights on either side, was nonetheless packed with vendors and diners, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere.\n\nA young man slowly walked down the street, holding the hand of a little girl.\n\nThe aroma of various snacks wafting from both sides was enough to make others' mouths water, but for this pair, big and small, it only made them frown.\n\nExcept for their necessary meals three times a day, they would only consume a small amount of the Other Shore Flower oral liquid, saving it whenever possible. When not taking the oral liquid, the smell of food was like torment to them, similar to ordinary people walking through a garbage dump.\n\nAfter walking for a while, they stopped together in a dark alley at the corner of the food street.\n\nEven the liveliest places have quiet corners, and this was no exception. Several tricycles that sanitation workers would use the next day were locked there, with a large garbage bin next to them, overflowing with waste.\n\nBecause of this, the stalls on the food street kept their distance from this spot. After all, the food sold at the stalls was not exactly clean. While it was said that eating unclean food wouldn't cause illness, few customers would be willing to eat right next to a pile of garbage.\n\nTherefore, this was the only spot on the entire street without the smell of cooking oil or drifting food aromas. Although mixed with the unique sour and pungent odor of the garbage heap, it allowed Zhou Ze and the little girl to breathe a sigh of relief, feeling that they could at least breathe somewhat normally here.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the little girl and pursed his lips.\n\nThe little girl turned her head aside.\n\n\"The stars are so beautiful tonight.\"\n\n\"It's cloudy today.\"\n\nThe little girl blinked and shot Zhou Ze a displeased look.\n\nZhou Ze took a step back and looked at her.\n\nThe little girl clenched a small fist and held it up towards Zhou Ze, making a twisting motion with her other fist.\n\nThe clenched fist slowly raised a middle finger towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shrugged, unconcerned.\n\nAfter all, he had mysophobia.\n\nTaking a deep breath, the little girl, with a look of disdain, walked towards the garbage heap and pushed aside the trash on top with her hand.\n\nA girl, delicate as a porcelain doll, rummaged through the garbage like a scavenger. If Hans Christian Andersen had seen her, he probably would have written a story called \"The Little Match Girl.\"\n\nFinally, after sifting through several more garbage bags, a bruised and swollen human face was revealed.\n\nLiu Chuyu, who was originally handsome and had the aura of a Korean oppa, was lying there, looking sickly.\n\nThe little girl reached out and patted his face.\n\n\"Slap! Slap! Slap!\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyebrows twitched slightly, fearing that the little girl would accidentally slap Liu Chuyu, who was still alive, to death.\n\nZhou Ze knew this was the little girl venting her frustration from scavenging. She dared not vent her anger on Zhou Ze, so she could only blame Liu Chuyu for being so useless as to be injured and then dumped in a garbage heap.\n\nFortunately, Liu Chuyu's vitality was still tenacious, or perhaps his attacker disdained to kill him or intentionally held back.\n\nAfter a few slaps, Liu Chuyu slowly opened his eyes.\n\nHe first saw the little girl and was stunned; he didn't recognize her.\n\nThen, he saw Zhou Ze standing behind the little girl.\n\nThis was the man he had always hated, wishing he could make a voodoo doll and curse him.\n\nThe next moment, he was moved to tears, like a wronged child crying to his parents after being bullied by classmates at school.\n\n\"Waaah... my life... is so bitter...\"\n\n...\n\nLiu Chuyu's home was in an ordinary residential complex. He had first bought the bottom unit and then bought the two units above it, knocking them through to create an internal duplex, akin to a small villa.\n\nThe interior decoration was rather simple. Two decent cars were parked in the garage, but the house itself had large areas of exposed bare concrete.\n\nThe bedroom was extremely minimalistic, with just a sleeping mat and an air conditioner. Nothing else.\n\nThe little girl had gone to buy some medical supplies. Zhou Ze had just finished bandaging Liu Chuyu. Although the external injuries were quite severe, especially the finger marks on his chest, centered on his left nipple with five indented points, they were still emitting waves of heat, as if afflicted by a fire toxin. However, the problem was not significant, at least not life-threatening.\n\nAfter bandaging, Zhou Ze deliberately washed his hands before returning and lighting a cigarette.\n\n\"Speak,\" the little girl nodded slightly at Liu Chuyu.\n\nThere was no point in hiding anything any longer.\n\nA prey is only prey when you have the ability to capture it.\n\nIf your prey turns around and beats you up, you should know who the real prey is.\n\nTherefore, Liu Chuyu no longer needed to hide anything for fear of having his contribution points stolen. On the contrary, if Zhou Ze could help him catch that prey, he could also share some contribution points as a form of comfort and compensation, even if the main portion wasn't his.\n\n\"Originally, I was about to catch him.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu had lost two teeth, right in the front, so he spoke with a lisp.\n\n\"I've been chasing that guy for two days. He's very cunning and good at hiding, but I still tracked him down. He wanted to resist, but his resistance was merely the struggle of a cornered beast in front of me.\"\n\n\"Get to the point,\" Zhou Ze tapped the windowsill.\n\n\"What's the point?\" Liu Chuyu asked.\n\n\"Start from when you were beaten.\"\n\n\"...\" Liu Chuyu.\n\nAfter a two-second silence, Liu Chuyu continued, \"Everything was under my control, and then another guy suddenly appeared. He clawed me, and then I felt all my strength disappear.\"\n\n\"So the injuries on your body were also left by him?\" Zhou Ze pointed to his face.\n\nLiu Chuyu shook his head. \"It was the ghost I was pursuing before. Seeing me incapacitated, he came up and beat me. It was the person who appeared later who stopped him from continuing, otherwise, I would have already reported back to hell.\"\n\n\"Alright, I understand,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"I'll handle this matter for now, as you are my subordinate.\"\n\n\"I have no objections,\" Liu Chuyu said with apparent freedom. \"In my current state, I can't have any objections.\"\n\n\"By the way, I have one more thing to ask you: are there any other Ghost Messengers in Changzhou?\"\n\n\"There are two more, and they are together.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"They're similar to you; they opened a shop, but it's a nightclub called 'Dark Color.' You can search for it on a map app. This nightclub is quite famous in Changzhou.\"\n\n\"When you had an accident, they did nothing?\" Zhou Ze narrowed his eyes. \"Or, they weren't interested in the reward for capturing ghosts at all?\"\n\n\"Boss, let me put it this way: their attitude towards life and work is even more exaggerated than yours.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Zhou Ze looked at Liu Chuyu.\n\n\"It means they're even more lazy than you,\" the little girl explained.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't dwell on the topic and instead asked, \"Do you have any leads on the ghost you were trying to capture?\"\n\n\"I know. This guy was a bus driver in his past life. Due to his operational error, he caused a traffic accident, and eleven passengers, including himself, died because of him.\n\nI found out his identity, so I intentionally set up surveillance near his home and discovered his whereabouts.\n\nAnyone who is reborn wants to go back and see their home, their wife, and their children.\"\n\n\"You think he'll go again?\" Zhou Ze pointed at Liu Chuyu. \"You're in this state now; if he wanted to go, he could have gone long ago.\"\n\n\"His wife remarried long ago. His mother, feeling remorse for her son's actions, has been living in a temple in Changzhou. His daughter worked as a nurse in a hospital a few years ago, resigned last year, and found a job at the temple to take care of her grandmother.\n\nThat temple is quite effective and has a restraining effect on people like us. I also instructed my underworld contacts to keep an eye on the grandmother and granddaughter on the outskirts, making it difficult for them to meet anytime soon.\"\n\n\"So troublesome,\" the little girl pouted.\n\n\"The Ghost Messenger's Certificate can't sense their location, do you know?\" Liu Chuyu said with some excitement. \"Damn it, they have the ability to hide their aura. Even if you pass right by them, you won't be able to sense them.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Liu Chuyu looked deeply at Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"Boss, I don't know if this girl has told you, but more than ninety percent of the escaped ghosts are cannon fodder, like New Year's bonuses for us Ghost Messengers. But some people have connections and prior arrangements.\n\nFor example... this one.\n\nIt took me a lot of effort to find out his identity, meticulously piecing it together, before I could finally pursue him.\"\n\n\"Since you knew he had connections, why were you so persistent?\"\n\n\"Boss, not everyone is as open-minded about getting promoted and making money as you are. I want contribution points, I want to climb higher, I don't want to be a pathetic Ghost Messenger stuck in this place for more than ten years, or even sixty years!\"\n\n\"Lin Ke, re-dress his wound in an hour,\" Zhou Ze instructed the little girl, then walked downstairs himself.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze left, the little girl bent down and looked at Liu Chuyu, who was sitting on the sleeping mat. \"That speech just now was good. With some adaptation and polishing, it could be put into a textbook.\n\nIt could be called 'My Struggle - Ghost Messenger Edition,' or perhaps 'After Death, Not Only Love, But Also Struggle.'\"\n\n\"That's what I truly feel,\" Liu Chuyu said calmly.\n\n\"Yes, I know, and I believe you.\"\n\n\"The Ghost Messengers in Tongcheng are all very strange.\"\n\n\"A bit unprofessional?\" the little girl helped him describe it.\n\nLiu Chuyu smiled.\n\nThe little girl also smiled and asked, \"How did you die in your previous life?\"\n\n\"Overworked due to continuous overtime at the company.\"\n\nThe little girl pouted.\n\n\"In this life, I think you're very likely to follow the same path. Those who are too proactive and eager to climb often don't achieve the results they expect. On the contrary, those who just muddle along, soaking up the sun, often have good things coming to them one after another.\"\n\n\"Heh, where did you hear such fallacious reasoning?\"\n\nThe little girl blinked and then looked towards the door of the room where Zhou Ze had just left, shaking her head and saying:\n\n\"I didn't hear it.\n\nI saw it.\"",

    "content": "\"Creak.\"\n\nUnder the cover of night, the door was gently pushed open.\n\nA figure tiptoed out from inside. Just as he was lightly closing the door and preparing to turn and walk away, the porch light suddenly flickered on.\n\nThe man froze. He wore a baseball cap and a black mask, concealing most of his face. However, his expression of shock was evident in his eyes.\n\n\"Pop!\"\n\nHe lit a cigarette. Lying on a long bench in the yard outside was a man in pajamas, who seemed to have been waiting for a long time.\n\nThe man yawned, flicked his ashes, and said, \"Are you an idiot? Honestly, can you even sleep? Can I sleep? So you thought you'd sneak out while I was asleep in the dark. Is your brain filled with swill?\"\n\nLawyer An glared back at the man standing behind him. Seeing his attire, he burst into laughter and said directly, \"Look at your outfit. Are you afraid people won't know you're a creature of the night? If you run into the night patrol, you'd be a prime target for questioning.\"\n\nThe other man removed his mask, revealing a face covered in a thick beard. He shrugged nonchalantly, \"Is there a problem with my identity?\"\n\n\"Your identity is certainly not the problem, since you're a soul transmigrated into another body. But don't forget, your identity is that of a patient under strict surveillance in the Changzhou Psychiatric Hospital!\"\n\n\"This isn't even your problem. Why did you guide me into the body of a mental patient? I don't believe it's that difficult to find someone who just died in this vast city of Changzhou!\"\n\n\"This is the 'life experience package' I arrange for all my clients. Prisons and psychiatric hospitals are excellent places for life experience. If you gain some life insights and stories, you might even write a book and become a writer.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, good to know. Now, go back obediently. If you can't sleep, just lie down. When dawn breaks, I'll escort you back to the psychiatric hospital and arrange a secret transfer for you.\"\n\n\"I'm not going back.\"\n\n\"It's not up to you. You've already breached the contract by running away, which is your fault. If I hadn't shown up in time yesterday, you'd probably be back in hell taking a bath in a cauldron of oil.\"\n\n\"I just want to see my mother and my daughter, to say a few words to them. I don't even need to reveal my identity.\"\n\n\"Idiot, do you remember how that Changzhou ghost messenger targeted you before? He caught your trail and deduced your identity, then set a trap, and you foolishly walked right into it!\"\n\n\"Help me with this.\"\n\n\"Sorry, I can't help you.\"\n\n\"Didn't you injure that ghost messenger? He shouldn't be showing up anytime soon...\"\n\n\"A ghost messenger from the next city has arrived, looking for an opportunity to feast. One of them is quite tricky, and I'd rather not confront him unless absolutely necessary.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because out of the three ghost messengers in Changzhou, two are constantly indulging in a life of debauchery. The only one who does any work was injured by me yesterday. So, the ghost messengers from the neighboring city are coming here to see if there's any opportunity to profit.\"\n\n\"Actually, life in the psychiatric hospital isn't that unbearable.\"\n\n\"It's definitely a million times better than hell.\"\n\n\"But I still have to see my family. I must see them.\"\n\nWith that, the man bolted outwards.\n\nLawyer An sighed, \"Do you really think you're the protagonist, reliving a triumphant return after crawling out of hell? In hell, you're the lowest of the low. In the mortal realm, don't forget your place. You are... rats crossing the street!\"\n\nThe flesh on Lawyer An's hand, holding the cigarette, began to peel away, revealing stark white bone. The next moment, Lawyer An vanished from the bench and reappeared behind the man, his skeletal hand piercing the man's chest.\n\nIt was decisive, clean, and even pulled out a long string of intestines. It was a shame there wasn't a hot pot nearby; pig's blood curdled with pig intestines would surely taste more delicious than the Sichuan dish *maoxuewang*.\n\nThe man looked at his pierced chest in disbelief. \"You... how... dare you...\"\n\n\"This is the mortal realm, not hell. No matter how far the reach of the one who sent you to illegally cross over for this task, it cannot control my life and death.\"\n\n\"Pop!\"\n\nThe skeletal hand was withdrawn.\n\nThe man collapsed to his knees, feeling his life force slowly draining away. Simultaneously, his soul began to dissipate as the body he inhabited ceased to function. This time, he wouldn't even have the chance to return to hell; it was utter annihilation.\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe man's eyes snapped open. Cold sweat had soaked his entire body. He remained in the posture of closing the door, as if everything that had just happened was merely a fleeting dream.\n\nTurning back, he saw Lawyer An on the bench outside, extinguishing the cigarette butt with his finger, a wisp of smoke curling upwards.\n\n\"Remember, there won't be a next time,\" Lawyer An's voice echoed faintly.\n\nThe man took several deep breaths and reopened the door, returning to the house.\n\n...\n\nIn the early morning, the little girl went out to buy breakfast, soy milk, fried dough sticks, and the like, buying three portions. Zhou Ze, the little girl, and Liu Chuyu sat at a small round table, each picking at their food.\n\nThe little girl had just complained that Zhou Ze hadn't brought Bai Yingying. Neither of them had slept well last night and appeared somewhat listless. Fortunately, it was only for one night, so it wasn't too bad.\n\nLiu Chuyu painstakingly ate spoonfuls of congee. The congee was thick and fragrant, but he found it incredibly difficult to swallow. He was unwilling to let his consciousness sleep and allow the original owner of this body to eat, as he knew his original host was quite flamboyant and he didn't want to lose face. Just as the little girl hadn't dared to let the real Wang Rui out to help the body sleep last night, the little girl didn't want to revert to the true, naive loli. Moreover, with Zhou Ze, a man, nearby, the thought of the real Wang Rui calling out, \"Uncle Xu, huggie, Rui Rui wants sleep-sleep,\" sent a shiver down her spine.\n\nHowever, Liu Chuyu was surprised that Zhou Ze and the little girl ate quickly and easily, as if they had no aversion to eating.\n\n\"How can you guys eat this?\" Liu Chuyu asked.\n\n\"People are iron, and meals are steel. Forcing yourself to eat is all it takes,\" Zhou Ze said earnestly.\n\n\"Forcing yourself to eat big mouthfuls, swallowing all your sorrow and tears into your stomach – that's life,\" the little girl said with feigned melancholy.\n\nIn any case, it was impossible to tell him they had the *Higanbana* Oral Solution. The more they used, the less they had, and both were using it sparingly. How could they possibly share it with others? Absolutely not!\n\nLiu Chuyu nodded thoughtfully, then picked up his spoon and began to gulp down the congee with all his might, forcing himself to swallow each mouthful quickly! He was like a soldier marching to his execution, bearing a strange sense of tragic grandeur.\n\nFollowing that, there was a \"Gag!\" Liu Chuyu covered his mouth, trying to hold it in. Zhou Ze and the little girl picked up their breakfasts and moved to another room. They didn't want their meal enjoyment to be ruined by the atmosphere.\n\nWhen they finished breakfast and re-entered the room, Zhou Ze covered his nose, and the little girl frowned. The room was covered in vomit, emitting a sour, pungent odor. Liu Chuyu lay prone, his face pale, sweating coldly. He had probably vomited bile.\n\n\"I really... can't eat it...\" Liu Chuyu said, sounding somewhat wronged.\n\n\"We all went through this,\" Zhou Ze comforted him.\n\n\"Try a few more times, you'll get used to it. You have to understand, the human body's adaptability is its strongest trait,\" the little girl added with some platitude.\n\nLiu Chuyu nodded, indicating he understood. Perhaps this was also a form of cultivation. His cultivation was not yet sufficient.\n\n\"Should we go to the temple today?\" the little girl asked Zhou Ze. She wanted to finish things quickly, earn her credits, and go back to sleep.\n\n\"Yes.\" Zhou Ze agreed. In truth, he was more curious about who had defeated Liu Chuyu, this ghost messenger. He had a feeling that person might be a bigger fish.\n\nBoss Zhou certainly wouldn't have imagined that he had just eaten with that person not long ago and was even invited to order from the menu. That silver card was still in his wallet.\n\nAs they were preparing to leave, the little girl habitually took out her ghost messenger ID and flipped through it. Then, she froze. She reached out and tugged at Zhou Ze, who was about to hail a taxi.\n\n\"The ghost messenger ID shows it now,\" she said.\n\nLiu Chuyu looked at them returning after having just left, and asked curiously, \"What's wrong?\"\n\nThe little girl placed the page of the ghost messenger ID in front of Liu Chuyu, then flipped to another page. On it were wanted posters for two female ghosts. It was difficult to discern beauty or ugliness from the posters, as they depicted souls in their afterlife state, beaten and bruised, certainly not appearing attractive.\n\n\"It's showing up? Two evil spirits have leaked their whereabouts?\" Liu Chuyu felt a pang of regret. Why hadn't such simple tasks appeared recently? Now that he, the \"leader,\" had just arrived, there were already performance targets delivered to his doorstep! If he had such good fortune before, why would he have been staking out that guy who could hide his aura like a private detective, and ended up in his current predicament?\n\n\"The key is the address, Dark Night Club.\" The little girl pointed to the address on the wanted poster. \"They're both there. Is that the nightclub opened by the other two ghost messengers you mentioned yesterday in Changzhou?\"\n\n\"There's only one in Changzhou, and it's located underground. People there party day and night. In short, it's always packed with customers.\"\n\nThe little girl looked at Zhou Ze, then at the ghost messenger ID. She found it absurd. She used to think Zhou Ze was quite lazy, but today she encountered two even more extreme cases. Two evil spirits who had illegally crossed over were now having a blast in the nightclub you two ghost messengers opened, and you both remain unfazed? How can you be such incompetent officials...",

    "content": "This street is considered a entertainment dragon in Changzhou. Various spa massage and nursing homes are densely distributed on both sides of the outside. There are many nightclubs in it.\n\n\n\nOpposite the Dark Night Conference is a night conference called \"Fuhe No. 5\".\n\n\n\nThe golden and blue ones are very elegant at first glance. The men and women are constantly flowing, and there are still many security guards standing at the door to maintain order.\n\n\n\nAnd the dark nights are much more low-key.\n\n\n\nA very ordinary door, without a luminous brand, only one long brand with black letters and white background similar to the doors of the marketing club in the early years:\n\n\n\n\"Dark Night Conference\"\n\n\n\nNot only the store is low-key, but also the customers entering and leaving are low-key. Many people walk in and out wearing hats or heads down, coming silently, and walking silently.\n\n\n\nNot like the noisy nightclub door, but more like a toxic distribution point\n\n\n\n\"Let's go, let's go in.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli was the first to be\n\n\n\nBut after just two steps, I can't walk anymore\n\n\n\nBecause Zhou Ze, behind him, reached out to grab her horse's tail\n\n\n\n\"Zhou Ze\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli shouted with anger\n\n\n\n\"It seems that it's not very good for children to go to this place.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a string of slightly unseen small words under the sign: \"According to the law, entry is not allowed to be entered under the age of 18 in this field.\"\n\n\n\n\"When I went out to wander that year, you were still looking forward to drinking ice cream in the orphanage.\"\n\n\n\n  \"oh\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze still doesn't do anything\n\n\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\n\n\"I think it's better to have someone outside, and it's a little more guarantee. Every evil spirit escapes.\"\n\n\n\n\"So, I'm waiting for you to throw a cup inside.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I can understand it so much.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's a nightclub inside, I can't even hear you falling the fish tank.\"\n\n\n\n\"Be good, watch outside\"\n\n\n\nAfter saying this,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked into the door\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli held her mouth and found a place to sit down.\n\n\n\nVery happy\n\n\n\n …………………\n\n\n\n   Two lifetimes have been human, but Zhou Ze has entered this entertainment venue for only a few times. The last time the old Taoist took him to the Sand Dance was a small gain.\n\n\n\nOf course, I have never eaten pork, I have always seen pig run\n\n\n\n  only,\n\n\n\nAfter entering,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze still felt a little surprised\n\n\n\nAfter entering the main door, it was not the upper floor, but the lower floor. I always stayed underground at night. After walking down three layers, I suddenly opened up after passing through a black road without lights.\n\n\n\nThere is no DJ's hot spot, nor the hustle and bustle. The sound is filled with lyrical piano music\n\n\n\nHere, it is decorated like a cave, and the so-called teahouse is just a trench. Some people sit on it, and some people lie thereThe service that travels through life paints a rich makeup, not a thick makeup that is scratching his head, but like a ghost in the sacred festival, but it has more oriental characteristics.\n\n\n\nFor example, long tongue ghosts, red-clothed female ghosts, etc.\n\n\n\nThere were also male cow head horse dressed in a maid dress, carrying beer and walking back\n\n\n\nThere is a man wearing a square crown in the middle area, holding a hairpin in his left hand and holding a paper in his right hand dancing a pipe dance there\n\n\n\nAfter seeing this scene, Zhou Ze's mouth subconsciously twitched\n\n\n\nThis is a typical example of being in the physical system.\n\n\n\nThat is, the commonly known as two-faced person\n\n\n\nThe boss of this nightclub is a ghost, but he actually lets the actor judge Cos play a special version of the uniform here, confusing\n\n\n\nThis idea,\n\n\n\nVery dangerous\n\n\n\nThere are several small attractions nearby, such as oil crocks, blood pools, and dog crocks. Of course, they are just prop scenes arranged\n\n\n\nA service student walked to Zhou Ze and signaled Zhou Ze to come with him. The service student helped Zhou Ze choose an empty pilgrimage group and let him sit down.\n\n\n\nWithout asking what Zhou Ze wanted to drink, he brought three bottles of red drinks without labels. The service staff said that this was fruit wine, which was made by oneself and could not be bought from other places.\n\n\n\nHere, there are not many choices, and there will be no menus for you to order the dazzling variety of alcohol. If you want to drink, drink this one. If you don’t want to drink, there is nothing else to order.\n\n\n\nAfter the service student left, Zhou Ze picked up the cup and took a sip.\n\n\n\nSour and sweet, and a bit like a sausage of old wine, the taste is quite good.\n\n\n\nBut I still feel that the clear and clear sour plum juice is delicious\n\n\n\nThe guests here were very peaceful, and everyone seemed to enjoy the local atmosphere created by the construction, as if they were dreaming that they were really coming to the local area.\n\n\n\nOnly Zhou Ze knew it\n\n\n\nIn the land,\n\n\n\nThere will be no service providers who bring you wine, hot towels, and sweat.\n\n\n\nAbout a moment later, the judge actor finished his performance and went down. He changed into a woman in a beautiful dress. She was dressed very gracefully and looked very delicate under the light that was not so dazzling. However, the materials of the clothes and the empty space inside created a visual experience similar to the clothes being dampened and exposed in the rain.\n\n\n\nThis woman held a bowl in her hand.\n\n\n\nPut the bowl on the top of the head, and people dance underneath it in a difficult manner.\n\n\n\nThere is water in the top bowl, but the water in the top does not fall out.\n\n\n\nAfter watching for a long time,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze finally identified it.\n\n\n\nThis is Meng Po of Cos\n\n\n\nIn the eyes of most people, Meng Po should be the image of an old man. Standing in front of the Naihe Bridge, people who have passed the bridge drink their Meng Po soup.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze remembered that he had asked Xiao Luoli specifically before.\n\n\n\nIs Meng Po very old?Xiao Luli shook her head, saying that she had never seen it, but if the place in the bridge often falls into it, wipes away all memory and reincarnates.\n\n\n\nWith Meng Po's status, I see the ghost messenger.\n\n\n\nIt’s like a senior Japanese military officer who looked at a tragic soldier during the War.\n\n\n\nWatching the performance, drinking, and experiencing the atmosphere, the time passed quickly, as if there was a feeling of being in the local area being awkward.\n\n\n\nOn the opposite side of Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nThere were two women sitting very close to each other, and they sat there from head to tail, with their backs straight up straight.\n\n\n\nLike two sculptures placed there\n\n\n\nZhou Ze can still see that they are flowing, constantly flowing\n\n\n\nIt is because the scenery is born\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought in his heart\n\n\n\nAfter a long time, the two women started drinking, and bottles of red fruit wine were poured into their mouths.\n\n\n\nDrink one side and continue crying, rub your eyes and continue drinking\n\n\n\nThis scene,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was amused\n\n\n\nMany places like to have a sorrowful and sweet party.\n\n\n\nFor example, when the leaders in college require students to install air conditioners in the dormitory, they always like to take students to think about how bitter and difficult it was when they went to school in that era. Now the conditions are already very good.\n\n\n\nThese two digits,\n\n\n\nAfter arriving here, I recalled the sad torture of the locals.\n\n\n\nThinking about the happiness and beauty that I am now regaining my body and still have,\n\n\n\nThe water flowed down with emotion\n\n\n\n  Yes,\n\n\n\nThey are not humans.\n\n\n\nBut two evil spirits\n\n\n\nZhou Ze raised his head and looked around again.\n\n\n\nNot to mention that this food was not hidden successfully.\n\n\n\nJust say that this kind of excerpt is now,\n\n\n\nThe ghost officer who opened this nightclub was really indifferent\n\n\n\nStill, I really follow the direction of the visitor being God, and I will not act anyway\n\n\n\nAfter drinking half a glass of fruit wine, just as Zhou Ze was about to take some action, a man sat down beside him, and picked up the remaining half glass of wine in front of him, and drank all the time.\n\n\n\n\"Friend, when I am here, just have fun and have fun.\"\n\n\n\nThe other party is not old, about 18 or 19 years old, but in those eyes, there is a glory of depression. This is a real depression, not a routine for young people to wear a cunt and play with a wound.\n\n\n\n\"You haven't seen it\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the two girls in front\n\n\n\n\"See it\"\n\n\n\nThe other party smiled,\n\n\n\n\"However, what if I see it?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was speechless for a whileIn the past,\n\n\n\nFor such conversations, he should be in the position where this young man stands. Those who talk to him will feel helpless and even look down upon their distractions and ignorance.\n\n\n\nAnd this time,\n\n\n\nFeeling despair,\n\n\n\nIt's Boss Zhou himself\n\n\n\nThe evil ghost is right in front of you,\n\n\n\nThe two large marks are placed in front of you.\n\n\n\nYou can take it even\n\n\n\n\"Did that boy named Liu get beaten yesterday?\" The other party asked Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nZhou Ze’s point head\n\n\n\n\"Okay\"\n\n\n\n  \"It's not bad\" \n\n\n\n\"That's good, otherwise no one will do anything in Changzhou. After he came, I felt very comfortable. I had a colleague who was willing to do things and could stay here as much as possible and not go out.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and stood up\n\n\n\nNo matter how generous others are, they are so rude.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze himself still has ambitions about performance points.\n\n\n\nAnd it's right in front of me\n\n\n\n\"Hey, I said you didn't hear me, you are a foreigner.\"\n\n\n\nThe young man reached out and grabbed Zhou Ze's cuff. He sat on the ground, tilting his neck back\n\n\n\n\"They are my guests. Drink some wine here and feel the atmosphere. You are going to fight others now, and you don't feel very cruel and tolerant.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath\n\n\n\nHe suddenly thought,\n\n\n\nThose who said they were going to advance,\n\n\n\nWill there be a kind of impulse to strangle oneself to death?\n\n\n\nBecause Zhou Ze has this kind of movement now,\n\n\n\nI really want to strangle this goods to death\n\n\n\n\"If you don't do things, I will help you, don't thank me.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk forward\n\n\n\n\"Don't really make me angry\"\n\n\n\nThe other party warned\n\n\n\n\"Change\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand and tried to snatch the other party's hand, but the other party's hand stretched out like a water snake, and directly locked Zhou Ze's arm\n\n\n\n\"Don't you understand the rules\"\n\n\n\nAt the same time,\n\n\n\nThe young man shouted to the two girls who were still crying there:\n\n\n\n\"The ghost messenger came to catch people and went to the ground to arrest the enemy.\"\n\n\n\nMany nearby customers laughed when they heard this shout, thinking it was a smile.\n\n\n\nBut the two girls who were still crying suddenly felt sick, and immediately stood up in panic and prepared to escape.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed,\n\n\n\nThe nails grew out in an instant.\n\n\n\nPunch directly into the other party's arm\n\n\n\n\"Hiss......Fuck\"\n\n\n\nThe young man shouted out in pain\n\n\n\nThe other party's arm suddenly shrank, but this time, Zhou Ze grabbed the other party's wrist and then threw him hard over his shoulder and hit the ground.\n\n\n\n\"Bang\"\n\n\n\nThe young man gasped in pain.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, he growled in anger:\n\n\n\n\"Don't think you are a ghost messenger, I dare not impress you. I really make me angry. I really want to try to see what it feels like to kill a ghost messenger from other places.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I don’t want to be a ghost servant anymore, and I’m not afraid of any consequences.”\n\n\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\n\n\nPull down,\n\n\n\nLooking at the other party’s pretty face:\n\n\n\n\"No need to worry about trying,\n\n\n\nI can tell you the answer directly.\n\n\n\nBecause I have killed a lot of them long ago.\"",

    "content": "\"Homemade fruit wine, would you like some?\"\n\nThe woman raised her wine glass and offered it to the man before her. Her posture was elegant, and in the dim light of the private room, she appeared even more captivating.\n\nThe man was still dressed in his signature flamboyant wine-red suit, his polished leather shoes gleaming, and his hair meticulously styled.\n\nEven when holding the wine glass, he first used his own handkerchief to wipe it clean before picking it up.\n\nHe showed no concern that his actions might reveal his apprehension about the other person's dirty hands, nor did he worry about her getting angry.\n\nThis was because, a quarter of an hour earlier, when Lawyer An came out of the restroom, he saw her waiting for him in the private room, picking her nose.\n\nAfter picking her nose, she looked at it, then rubbed it into a ball between her fingers, and flicked it away.\n\nLawyer An could overlook things he couldn't see, which was why he could spend a whole night with a sex worker. But things he saw lodged themselves in his mind like thorns, making it difficult not to care.\n\nA beautiful woman's boogers are still boogers, aren't they?\n\n\"You're still as meticulous as ever. You've been the same since the first time I saw you, two years ago.\"\n\nThe woman was wearing a black dress, her tall and voluptuous figure fully displaying the charm of a mature woman. Of course, she wasn't trying to seduce anyone, nor did she need to.\n\nShe owned half of this nightclub.\n\n\"I can't help it. In my previous life, when I was eating raw meat in the rainforest, I vowed in my heart that I would treat myself well in my next life. This is my next life, so I have to live as meticulously and refined as possible.\"\n\n\"Let's get back to business, my esteemed lawyer.\"\n\nThe woman stood up, her face turning serious.\n\nMeanwhile, Lawyer An continued to savor the fruit wine, his legs crossed, swaying leisurely, appearing even more nonchalant than before.\n\nIt was as if to say, \"Go ahead and be serious, but if I actually take it to heart, then I'm the loser.\"\n\n\"My employer has always valued you highly and believes that your continued wandering through the mortal world in this unrefined and unrestrained manner is not sustainable. Firstly, while you bear some responsibility for what happened back then, your circumstances were understandable. However, to be stripped of your position in the underworld and never be employed again is a punishment that is far too severe. Secondly, if you continue to roam the human world with your current ambiguous status, and you encounter a responsible inspector who decides to deal with you, it will be very troublesome for you. My employer feels great injustice for your situation.\"\n\nLawyer An shrugged his shoulders. \"Thank you for your employer's appreciation. Although I don't think you'll meet your employer, and your employer would sit down and chat with you.\"\n\n\"......\" The woman.\n\n\"The wine is good, but the words are not very pleasant,\" Lawyer An said with a smile, putting down his wine glass. At the same time, he added, \"You two were also handled by me. I took money from the other side and helped you get your identities sorted. However, what I didn't expect was that you actually managed to obtain ghost official certificates and become ghost officials. And now you're living such a carefree and comfortable life.\"\n\n\"That's because, although my employer is in hell, his influence is not limited to hell. Things like ghost official certificates, my employer can still...\"\n\n\"Things like ghost official certificates are quite simple even for me to procure.\"\n\n\"......\" The woman.\n\n\"Really. I heard there's a blind man in Shanghai who also became a ghost official and cleared his identity. He seems to have a sackful of these ghost official certificates. It's like digging potatoes on the hillside; you dig up a whole sackful.\"\n\nThe woman took a deep breath. She, who had always cultivated her composure and stayed out of things, felt an urge to kill the man before her at that moment.\n\nBecause this guy really didn't know how to chat!\n\nLawyer An gently tapped the coffee table with his fingers. \"That's all for now. I have another guest waiting for me at home. He might be a bit restless and unruly, so I need to keep an eye on him, otherwise, he'll go off looking for his mommy again.\"\n\nWith that, Lawyer An picked up his briefcase and prepared to leave.\n\nThe woman accompanied him out of the private room. They stood on the second floor. There were quite a few guests below, but due to the dim lighting, those below couldn't see clearly what was happening above. However, those above could see quite clearly below. This was intentional; the lighting and layout were designed this way because the two owners of the establishment enjoyed this feeling of silently observing from the second floor.\n\n\"Are you really not going to reconsider, Lawyer An? Joining us is actually quite leisurely. Look at me and my partner; we don't have to do anything, we can spend our days here indulging in pleasure and living worry-free.\"\n\nLawyer An shook his head.\n\nThe woman nodded and made a gesture of \"please,\" then turned and walked back into the private room. Clearly, this meeting had not been a pleasant one for her either.\n\nAfter the woman closed the door, Lawyer An licked his lips and repeated her words: \"Yes, because besides indulging in pleasure and living worry-free, what else would people like you do?\"\n\nTurning his head, he saw the Meng Po cosplayer dancing below with a bowl on her head. The mockery on Lawyer An's lips became even more pronounced.\n\nBeing ghost officials, not striving for improvement is understandable, as merit points are useless to them. The powers behind them would not allow them to climb higher and become constables or inspectors, as that would give them the ability to break free from their control. And the two of you are content to continue like this. Tsk, the underworld is indeed too vast, so vast that even the lower echelons are filled with so many parasites.\n\nThe Meng Po continued her dance below, and many of the spectators below were applauding and cheering. Lawyer An lit a cigarette and flicked the ash. They lived a life of comfort and ease that ordinary souls could only dream of, relying on their positions within the underworld's system, yet they still enjoyed playing these little games to project an image of individuality. Truly spoiled. They were merely taking advantage of the power struggles among the higher-ups to offer a little treat to your so-called esteemed employer, and they actually thought of themselves as someone important? The underworld's record clearly states that the one who once wished to govern independently on the Styx in hell, attempting to establish his own dominion, was nearly exterminated by Ying Gou, who was forced by the Yellow Emperor to oversee the Underworld Sea. Thousands of years have passed, and yet they are dreaming the same dream again.\n\nWalking leisurely down the stairs, Lawyer An continued his internal monologue: Damn it, I just want to live a normal life comfortably for a few decades and enjoy life. My brain must have been kicked by a door to want to get involved with you guys. Don't you even look at yourselves in a puddle of water to see what kind of characters you are.\n\n\"Bang!\" A loud noise came from below.\n\nLawyer An looked over. Not far from him, a familiar figure forcefully threw another familiar figure to the ground. What the hell, how did this person also come to Changzhou? He's really haunting me! Lawyer An immediately used his briefcase to cover his face, preparing to slip away. People who dare to take on private jobs in the human world and walk the edge of order, he couldn't say for sure about anything else, but their instinct for self-preservation and avoiding danger was top-notch. Although he didn't know the specific reason, he instinctively feared Zhou Ze! Moreover, he felt that his instincts had a very low probability of being wrong, so he immediately turned to leave through the back door, trying to avoid any encounter with that person.\n\nHowever, what you fear will happen. First, two girls ran back screaming from the exit. Then, a loli with a long tongue, majestic and filled with inexplicable resentment, charged in. The customers in the nightclub, due to the dim lighting, couldn't see clearly and thought the long-tongued loli was part of the club's performance. No one screamed, and no one was scared. Except for the actress playing Meng Po's Peculiar Tales, who froze in place. The customers below applauded together, shouting, \"Creative! Creative! Cheers! Cheers!\" Someone even whistled at the little loli, shouting, \"Little darling, come down and have a drink with Uncle.\" If the little loli hadn't been focused on those two girls at the moment, those whistling and heckling would have likely faced a beating.\n\nThe two girls wanted to escape through the back door, which was the same path as Lawyer An. One of the girls had a livid face. Because they were being pursued by ghost officials, they, who had just been moved to tears by the prospect of a new life, were instantly turned into fugitives. A claw swept directly towards Lawyer An; she intended to shove aside anyone blocking her way. At this point, she couldn't afford to be low-key or hide; escaping first was the most important thing.\n\nIn a brief moment, Lawyer An quickly chose between continuing to hide his identity and lying in the hospital for half a month, during which even if there were pretty nurses, he might not be able to act recklessly due to a back injury.\n\n\"Crack!\" \"Snap!\"\n\nLawyer An directly broke one of the girl's hands, then kicked her knee, forcing the girl to kneel on the ground. He then grabbed the other girl by the neck and slammed her to the ground, pinning her underneath. The entire sequence of actions was fluid and skillful. If someone who had served in the military were present, they would likely recognize the military style in Lawyer An's moves.\n\nThe little loli retracted her tongue and stopped, staring at the suited man before her with vigilance. She didn't recognize the lawyer and assumed that the ghost officials from Changzhou had come out to snatch kills! Zhou Ze, who had just thrown the young man to the ground, also looked over. He was slightly taken aback. Clearly, Boss Zhou also recognized Lawyer An's identity. After all, that silver card was still in his wallet. The young man who was slammed to the ground by Zhou Ze showed a look of confusion when he saw Lawyer An taking action. If the two of them were deliberately slacking off and not wanting to be promoted, then this Lawyer An should have been genuinely timid and cowardly, but his current uncharacteristic behavior made him a bit perplexed.\n\nThe woman on the second floor, hearing the commotion, emerged from the private room again. Like the young man, she didn't jump down but continued to watch the unfolding events from above.\n\n\"Evil forces, causing harm to the human world. A harmonious society is everyone's responsibility!\" Lawyer An declared with righteous indignation, his voice impassioned.\n\nThen, Lawyer An pointed to the two girls on the ground and said to Zhou Ze and the little loli, \"Two young heroes, I'll hand over the villains to you for detention by the authorities. Farewell for now, I'm off!\" Slapping his feet, Lawyer An, who wanted nothing to do with Zhou Ze, just wanted to disappear quickly. However, before he could take two steps, he felt a gust of wind from behind. Lawyer An turned his head, but his neck was immediately grabbed by Zhou Ze, and he was forcefully pushed back until his back hit the wall.\n\n\"What is your purpose in approaching her?\" Zhou Ze asked, staring at Lawyer An.\n\nWow! Lawyer An felt like crying! Damn it, it's really just a professional relationship! Your wife and I really have nothing going on! I dodge you like you're a plague god, how would I dare to have any thoughts about your wife!\n\n\"Don't misunderstand... don't misunderstand... meeting her, it was really just a coincidence... coincidence... it was... it was fate... fate, perhaps...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Lawyer An felt the hand gripping his neck tighten considerably!",

    "content": "\"Damn,\n\nMy neck is going to break...\"\n\nLawyer An felt deeply wronged. He had kindly helped the two of them take down the evil spirit. Not only did they not thank him, but they weren't in a hurry to send the evil spirit to hell for points. Yet, they were clinging onto him for what reason?\n\n\"Your wife is indeed beautiful, but your suspicion is too exaggerated. Is your wife made of Tang Monk's flesh to have such great appeal?\"\n\n\"Squeak...\"\n\nLawyer An flipped his wrist. He no longer dared to let Zhou Ze choke his neck. What if the other party, in a fit of madness, simply snapped it? Then he would have nothing.\n\nThis wasn't the kind of situation to be timid.\n\nZhou Ze felt his arms being grabbed by the opponent, and then a tremendous force transmitted. He instantly lost his balance and was lifted up.\n\nThis was a very ancient and direct way of dealing with things, but it displayed a mastery of strength and technique.\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze's other hand grabbed down, his black fingernails emitting a strange glow.\n\n\"Fate? I'll give you fate!\"\n\nLawyer An frowned and immediately raised his left hand.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nIt sounded like swords clashing, a harsh noise. The nightclub's sound system let out a piercingly long tone. Zhou Ze felt a throbbing pain in his fingertips and instinctively retreated several steps.\n\nLawyer An looked at the five bloody marks on his palm in astonishment. It was somewhat unbelievable. He knew how tough his hand was, but even so, it had been cut open by the other party in just one encounter.\n\nJust then, the two girls who had been subdued by Lawyer An seized the opportunity to get up and escape. The little loli reached out and grabbed one of them. Zhou Ze grabbed the other who was trying to rush past him.\n\nSeizing this opening, Lawyer An didn't hesitate and rushed towards the back door. He didn't even bother to leave a harsh word, running off cleanly and decisively.\n\nBoss Zhou, holding the girl beneath him, didn't pursue further.\n\nEach holding a girl, they walked out of the nightclub. Zhou Ze deliberately checked the young man he had knocked down earlier but found that he was no longer in his original position.\n\nHe remained on guard the whole way, but after leaving the nightclub, the Changzhou ghost messenger, who had been trying to compete with him, never reappeared. This made Zhou Ze relax a little, but also feel a bit confused.\n\nWhy did it feel like the ghosts from Tongcheng were all tough nuts to crack, stubbornly going head-to-head with him, while the ghosts from Changzhou were all more timid than the last?\n\n...\n\n\"Why didn't you let me chase him!\"\n\nThe young man stood on the second floor, rubbing the bruises on his shoulders and asking somewhat dissatisfiedly.\n\nThe woman glanced at him and said irritably, \"Are you blind? Even Lawyer An didn't dare to provoke him head-on. He didn't resist fiercely when his neck was being choked. Do you still want to go further and get involved?\"\n\nThe young man nodded unhappily. He had seen that scene. Lawyer An, despite his lawyerly appearance and money-grubbing image, was a tough character back in the day. Although the Underworld had stripped him of his official status, it hadn't degraded him to the point of being easily looked down upon.\n\n\"Then, do we need to report this guy's matter to the higher-ups?\" the young man asked.\n\nIn ordinary espionage dramas, \"higher-ups\" is used to refer to superiors. But here, saying \"below\" was quite appropriate. After all, the superiors were all underground, working in the shadows.\n\n\"Not for now. First, convey Lawyer An's attitude. Be as vague as possible. Tell them we will continue to strive for him.\"\n\n\"Why should we cover for him? He clearly looks down on us. We should let the higher-ups know and find a way to get someone to deal with him, otherwise...\"\n\n\"Idiot! The mission given to us by the higher-ups is to win him over to our side. Do you want to tell them that we are incompetent and can't do anything besides eat and wait to die?\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand.\"\n\n\"Also, investigate which region these two ghost messengers are from, and try to figure out their connection to that model worker, Liu Chuyu.\"\n\n\"I understand. I'll go do it.\"\n\n...\n\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\nThe little loli asked Zhou Ze, then seemed to think of something and said, \"Afraid they'll chase us out?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't respond.\n\n\"They're too lazy to do the work themselves. We're helping them clean up. What reason would they have to find trouble with us?\"\n\nAlthough she had a loli's body, she was an experienced ghost messenger. So, when the little loli said these words, they carried a strong \"underworld flavor.\" It was like holding a cleaver and shouting, \"We, Hong Xing, are not afraid of anything, not even Dong Xing! If you're not happy, we'll go hack them!\"\n\nThe two women, each grabbed by one person, struggled as they were being led forward. Clearly, they knew the consequences of being captured and taken back. Returning to hell was worse than death!\n\n\"Can you make them quiet down?\" Zhou Ze asked. If he held them like this and encountered any helpful citizens on the way, they would probably call the police for kidnapping.\n\n\"That's easy.\"\n\nSaying that, the little loli bit her right index finger and flicked it towards the two girls. A drop of blood appeared on each of their foreheads. The two immediately quieted down, like marionettes. Zhou Ze gave them a slight push, and they automatically, numbly walked forward.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the little loli.\n\nThe little loli scratched her head. \"You can learn this method too. It's a small trick, quite effective against ghosts who have been caught and subdued. But it probably won't work well for you. Your blood carries a zombie aura; it might directly kill them. Oh right, are we sending them to hell right here?\"\n\n\"Let's take them to Liu Chuyu first. That way, he can also get some points.\"\n\nThe little loli shrugged and didn't object. Bosses liked to use these small benefits to impress their employees. As a subordinate, it would be considered lacking in foresight not to flatter her boss by saying he truly cared about his subordinates. Naturally, she wouldn't do something foolish like mock him at this moment.\n\nExiting the nightclub, the sky overhead was covered with dense, dark clouds, and the wind had picked up significantly. If the old Taoist were nearby, he would have immediately moved closer to Zhou Ze and shouted, \"Protect the Emperor! There is demonic energy here!\"\n\n\"Why did the sky get dark? I didn't sense anything unusual,\" the little loli said with some confusion. If an evil spirit or vengeful soul were causing trouble, it could alter the weather in a small area, but it would definitely be accompanied by an atmosphere of resentment. To put it scientifically, it was equivalent to the grudges released by ghosts forming an independent magnetic field, affecting the nearby climate. The most exaggerated and powerful were the Drought Demons, as the saying goes, \"When the Drought Demon appears, the land turns to scorched earth for a thousand miles.\"\n\n\"Typhoon 'Ampil' is making landfall today. It should start raining and windy.\"\n\n\"Then shall we take a taxi back?\" the little loli asked. Coincidentally, a bus approached from not far away, and there was a bus stop right outside the nightclub. The bus had a sign that read \"Route 11.\" There weren't many people on board.\n\n\"I remember this route passes by Liu Chuyu's place. Let's take the bus; it's more convenient.\"\n\nThe bus stopped at the bus stop. No one got off. Zhou Ze and the little loli each pushed the girl in front of them onto the bus. The two girls obediently sat in the empty seats with a somewhat dazed expression, as instructed. The little loli and Zhou Ze sat next to them respectively. The bus started to move again and slowly drove forward.\n\n\"By the way, how are you planning to resolve the matter with Director Lin? You're neither pushing her away nor letting her go. It's getting tiresome watching you.\"\n\n\"No rush.\"\n\n\"Heh, men. I just find it annoying. Let's just be ghost messengers and not act in some tragic drama. All this lingering affection, on-again, off-again, you and me, fate playing tricks... Don't you feel tired?\"\n\n\"You're still young; you wouldn't understand.\"\n\nThe little loli pouted, too lazy to talk about her past glories. The bus had been driving for a while. At first, Zhou Ze didn't think anything was wrong, but gradually, he noticed a problem. The most obvious problem was that the few passengers on the bus were all holding yellow oil-paper umbrellas, and there was one placed next to the bus driver.\n\n\"There's something wrong.\" The little loli also turned around and looked at Zhou Ze sitting behind her. \"Our luck is a bit bad; it seems we've boarded a ghost bus.\"\n\nGhost bus. Zhou Ze had actually ridden one before. Back then, a driver who had died but was still driving a Didi to earn money used a paper car to transport passengers, intending to earn tuition for his child. Zhou Ze remembered that he had accidentally burned a hole in the car door with his cigarette butt.\n\nThere are many ghost stories about buses, with countless versions. If an ordinary person boarded this bus and noticed the problem, they would probably turn pale with fright and try their best to find an opportunity to escape. But Zhou Ze and the little loli were ghost messengers. Riding a ghost bus felt like a habitual thief entering a police station; it was as familiar as their own unit's bus. After all, they were in the same system. If a bus was used for personal matters, so be it. The Underworld probably didn't have a disciplinary committee.\n\n\"The typhoon is here, the clouds have blocked the sun, and coupled with our heavy Yin energy, and us bringing two people possessed by evil spirits, it's not surprising that we've encountered a ghost bus.\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched his arms and suddenly thought of something. He hadn't been able to ask about it before due to his status, but now he could.\n\n\"Right, that time you had your car accident, why did you deliberately scare the driver? That driver died in the accident. If I hadn't been there, your current body would have also kicked the bucket.\" Before, Zhou Ze thought the little loli was just playing around, treating human lives as a game. Later, Zhou Ze also understood that ghost messengers couldn't just kill people arbitrarily. Although the little loli was willful, wild, liked to be unreasonable, liked to pit people, was shrewd, stubborn, and opinionated, she was also a person who followed rules and regulations.\n\n\"That matter, I thought you had forgotten.\"\n\n\"I never forgot.\"\n\n\"I realized that the driver had died suddenly from some illness, but the inertia of life was still controlling him to continue what he was doing. It's a kind of inertia. The old Taoist told me that in the illusion of the Yin-Yang Book, didn't you see a student in the dormitory with corpse spots on their body who was still attending classes and washing up in the dormitory? It's similar to that situation.\"\n\nThe little loli said somewhat irritably, \"Because he didn't realize he was dead and was still driving. I was worried he might suddenly cause some problem and lead to a tragedy, so I had a little compassion and revealed my true form to scare him awake. Who knew this guy couldn't handle the shock and directly stepped on the accelerator, almost getting me sent back to the Underworld to report for duty again!\"\n\nAs she said this, the little loli turned her head and shouted in the direction of the bus driver, \"Master, drive carefully. We're all from the same unit. It's okay to go a little slower; no one will blame you.\"\n\n-----\n\nRecently, I've been adjusting to the time difference, and I've been groggy all day. This is the only update for today. I need to go to sleep. Also, everyone can follow my public WeChat account \"Pure Little Dragon\" or \"kongbu66,\" where I will post some side stories.",

    "content": "The driver did not respond enthusiastically:\n\n\"Yo, little sister, which workshop are you from?\"\n\nHe just continued driving his vehicle steadily. He was cautious with the brakes, didn't even change lanes to overtake, and obediently waited behind.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit curious. If this ghost vehicle just passed through, could it still hit something?\n\nThe next moment,\n\nThe bus stopped at a traffic light intersection.\n\nWaiting for the red light!\n\nA smile crept onto Boss Zhou's lips, and he said, \"This ghost driver drives more cautiously and adheres to the rules than a living driver.\"\n\nThe little loli was dismissive, digging in her ear with her little finger and saying:\n\n\"The ghost cars are driven by drivers who died in car accidents in their past lives.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nNo wonder.\n\nBecause they died in car accidents,\n\nThey understood reverence even more.\n\nZhou Ze then remembered the Mercedes that had played car drifting and lane weaving with him not long ago.\n\nIn the end, it was flipped over by him, doing a Thomas spin before landing on the ground.\n\nLast time Zhou Ze rode in the paper car of that deceased man, strictly speaking, that paper car was a black market vehicle in the underworld, operating without a license.\n\nAlthough the traffic police couldn't do anything about him, it was ultimately a violation of the rules.\n\nBut this car, it should be considered an underworld bus. Both the passengers and the driver displayed a very high level of cultivation and skill.\n\nZhou Ze also realized that there weren't many ghosts on this bus, except perhaps the driver. If one looked closely at the passengers holding yellow oil-paper umbrellas, their faces, beneath the thick rouge, were paper-white.\n\nOn the bus, there were plump and slender, elegant and intelligent individuals, both men and women. They were all \"express deliveries\" burned by the living for the underworld.\n\nWhat unique tastes.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know about those burned for men below. They clearly didn't look like servants, but were dressed very fashionably and even wore sunglasses. Were these filial descendants sending them for their fathers or mothers?\n\nTruly thoughtful and considerate.\n\n\"Those who can burn things to be sent down are not ordinary people,\" the little loli explained, seeing Zhou Ze looking around.\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"Either the deceased person was extraordinary, or the living person is extraordinary.\n\nAll beings are equal, not only in the human world is this a load of nonsense, but special classes and meat-eaters exist everywhere, and even more so in hell.\"\n\n\"Speaking of which, I really want to see the depths of hell,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAfter all,\n\nEvery time he entered hell, he only walked around the initial section of the Yellow Springs Road, at most saying hello to the faceless woman under the pond there. He had never ventured deep.\n\n\"Sometimes, just peeking from the outside is the most comfortable. That way, you still have fantasies, passion, and impulses.\"\n\nThe little loli stretched,\n\n\"If you go in, you'll just shiver and it'll be bland.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nWhy did this explanation sound so… suggestive?\n\nThe little loli smiled and continued, \"The most important thing is that we low-level ghost emissaries are like grassroots civil servants. In reality, grassroots civil servants are often the most miserable. If your fate is also bad, and you end up being paired with a poverty alleviation program in some remote village.\n\nAs for us grassroots civil servants in hell, even if we fight amongst ourselves, as long as the matter isn't too excessive, the underworld can turn a blind eye, completely letting things go as they are.\n\nDon't laugh, it's not just you, I'm the same. I haven't been to most places in hell either. Because in some places, if you go, they don't care if you're one of them or a ghost emissary. It's normal for them to simply brush you aside and deal with you along with the wandering souls.\"\n\n\"Indeed, a tale of bitter tears.\"\n\nBoss Zhou suddenly felt that being a civil servant wasn't that great. It was much more comfortable to sunbathe and drink coffee at his bookstore every morning.\n\n\"Is this car a delivery car?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"You could say that. Our identities are special, so we can hitch a ride. This is also because the two ghost emissaries in Changzhou are even lazier than you and don't bother managing things. Liu Chuyu is a newcomer, and you've seen his home. It hasn't formed a spiritual atmosphere like our bookstore, where souls come to us on their own.\n\nIf you cleared out the zombies and ghouls in the bookstore, business might even be better.\"\n\nThe little loli also took the opportunity to put in a word against Bai Yingying.\n\nAt this time, the car stopped, and the doors opened.\n\nQuite a few people got on,\n\nDressed in various ways.\n\nThere was a beautiful little maid dressed in ancient attire,\n\nThere was a subservient-looking house servant,\n\nOf course, there were also trendy ones,\n\nEven some \"Shamate\" types.\n\nAll sorts of people,\n\nDozens of them boarded,\n\nAnd these people were carrying paper mahjong tables,\n\nA bundle of iPhone Xs,\n\nAnd other gifts to be sent down.\n\nThe carriage was immediately packed full, and Zhou Ze was also squeezed among many people.\n\nThese people didn't speak, nor did they say things like \"Please give up your seat.\" They weren't really human, so they were very orderly. Although it was crowded, everyone was quiet. The standing people swayed with the bus's resumption of motion,\n\nLike a sea of seaweed, swaying in unison.\n\nHe reached out and stroked his chin.\n\nIt's a shame that these things can't be recorded by mobile phones or other electronic devices.\n\nOtherwise, if a video was uploaded,\n\nIt would probably be very popular.\n\n\"This car is driving so slowly,\" the little loli complained a little.\n\n\"It's free, so it doesn't matter,\" Zhou Ze said with peace of mind.\n\n\"It automatically deducts冥钞 (underworld currency),\" the little loli rolled her eyes at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Driver, drive faster, we're running out of gas!\"\n\nShaking and swaying, they finally passed more than half of the journey, not far from Liu Chuyu's house. Zhou Ze looked out the window; it was still raining heavily.\n\n\"Is it raining in Tongcheng too?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Tongcheng is closer to the sea than Changzhou, so it must be raining harder here. My dad just sent me a WeChat message saying he and my mom were in Shanghai preparing to go on a trip. Tonight, they planned to go to the Eight Million Stadium to watch the match between SIPG and Evergrande, but it was postponed due to a typhoon warning.\"\n\n\"Aren't your parents at the sanatorium anymore?\"\n\n\"They're not staying there. He plans to take her out to travel and see the sights.\"\n\n\"Hmm, going out for a walk might be good for her recovery.\"\n\n\"Don't kid me, he's probably given up on treatment,\" the little loli shook her head. \"He's a very capable psychologist, but he can't even cure his own wife's illness. The sense of loss from that must be immense.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"So, I wouldn't be surprised at all if someone came to the bookstore to notify me that they were in a car accident or encountered a tsunami somewhere.\"\n\n\"You mean…\"\n\n\"It's normal, a joint suicide.\"\n\n\"That's an exaggeration.\"\n\nZhou Ze understood Wang Ke. Some things might change with life experiences, but certain core qualities are hard to eradicate.\n\nThey were all orphans, so they knew that surviving to adulthood was already a stroke of luck. Therefore, they would never lightly consider ending their lives.\n\n\"I'm just preparing for the worst. If she dies, I can accept it, but if he dies too, I will be very sad.\"\n\nBefore Zhou Ze could ask who \"he\" referred to, the bus stopped again.\n\n\"Creak…\"\n\nThe doors opened.\n\nThey stopped for a long time,\n\nBut no one got on.\n\nThe driver didn't rush them,\n\nJust kept the doors open and waited.\n\nZhou Ze and the little loli looked out the window towards the front of the bus.\n\nThe person about to board was an old man, estimated to be around the same age as the old Taoist priest, but much less well-maintained.\n\nThat old Taoist priest became more enchanting as he aged,\n\nGood waist, good kidneys, good performance,\n\nIt is said that many manufacturers wanted to invite the old Taoist priest to endorse health products after watching his live streams.\n\nBut the old Taoist priest refused them all. He didn't want to fall into that health product trap. In his words, what if one night a ghost came into the bookstore and said that it had reported to hell early because of the health product he endorsed? How embarrassing would that be?\n\nThe old man was very thin, so thin that he looked like skin and bones. He didn't get on the bus. Although the bus stopped right in front of him, he still sat on the curb, carefully weaving his bamboo basket.\n\n\"Is he a ghost emissary?\" the little loli asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"No.\"\n\n\"Then what is it? He has such status. This driver has a very bad temper. Although he let us on, he didn't even say hello.\n\nAnd now he's willing to wait here for someone to finish weaving a bamboo basket before getting on.\"\n\n\"He seems to be just a wandering soul.\"\n\n\"How is that possible? Can a wandering soul get on this bus?\"\n\n\"He looks a bit familiar,\" Zhou Ze frowned. \"This old man, I think I saw him somewhere recently.\"\n\n\"Hey, driver, are you going or not? I'm in a hurry to get home early to cook for my kids!\"\n\nThe little loli shouted impatiently.\n\nThe driver was unmoved.\n\n\"Damn it, why? Could he be an inspector or a judge out on a secret visit?\" the little loli was also getting suspicious.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe old man finished weaving his bamboo basket, put it on his back, and got on from the front door.\n\nThe driver closed the doors but didn't immediately start the engine.\n\nInstead, he proactively cleared a path for the old man, escorting him through the crowded carriage.\n\nAll the way,\n\nTo Zhou Ze and the little loli's front.\n\nThe driver's face was ashen, clearly having been dead for a long time. However, he was wearing a uniform, and nothing else was visible.\n\nHe reached out, pointed at the little loli,\n\nAnd directly said:\n\n\"Give up your seat to the elder.\"\n\n\"…………\" The little loli.\n\nHoly crap,\n\nAre you serious?\n\nEven on a ghost bus, you're resorting to moral blackmail?\n\nNow that they were closer, the aura perception was clearer. The little loli could confirm that the old man was truly just an ordinary wandering soul.\n\nJust as she was about to speak,\n\nZhou Ze reached out and placed his hand on the little loli's shoulder, smiled, and stood up, indicating that he would give up his seat.\n\nThe old man thanked Zhou Ze,\n\nAnd sat down.\n\nSeeing the elder seated, the driver walked back to restart the bus.\n\n\"Hey, boss, you can't be this cowardly! Although we ghost emissaries aren't well-received in the underworld, we shouldn't be giving up our seats to wandering souls on a ghost bus!\n\nThis is outrageous. Even wandering souls dare to throw their weight around in front of ghost emissaries?\"\n\nZhou Ze handed his phone to the little loli.\n\nThe little loli took it and looked at the screen,\n\nShe was stunned.\n\nThis was a news report from a few days ago:\n\n\"A thug threatened a young girl with a knife, demanding compliance. The girl struggled and escaped, seeking help from Deng, who was seventy years old and doing his work by his doorstep.\n\nDeng stepped forward to engage the thug, allowing the girl to escape. Deng, over seventy years old, was stabbed and killed by the thug.\n\nIt is reported that\n\nDeng's family was not well-off, and he still needed to weave bamboo baskets at the age of seventy to support his family.\"\n\nAfter reading the news,\n\nAnd then looking at the bamboo basket placed at the old man's feet, where he sat down,\n\nThere were neatly arranged \"Hero of Courageous Action\" awards issued by the local government.\n\nThe little loli fell silent and stopped complaining.\n\nAfter all,\n\nSuch privilege,\n\nTruly left one speechless,\n\nAnd with nothing to say.\n\nPS: This story took place in Shilou Village, Tianping Town, Teng County, Guangxi. The murderer has been sentenced to death, and the local government at all levels has commended the old hero and awarded him compensation.",

    "content": "The bus, as usual, was moving slowly, swaying unsteadily.\n\nThe people inside swayed along with it, like a pendulum, lifelessly repeating in a fixed rhythm.\n\nFrom birth,\nSwaying,\nTo death.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside the old man, holding onto the overhead handle. There were many people around, but not much of a crushing feeling, after all, they were just paper figures.\n\nThe old man looked up at Zhou Ze and smiled a little embarrassedly, saying apologetically,\n\n\"My legs aren't good, I have rheumatism.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Although I know it doesn't hurt now, because I'm already dead, but seeing the heavy rain outside, it feels like it hurts again.\"\n\nThe old man looked out at the pouring rain, his eyes filled with reminiscence.\n\nThe old rheumatism had accompanied him for many years, from torment at the beginning, slowly to numbness, and finally to habit;\n\nUntil the day he died and became a ghost,\nIt turned into nostalgia.\n\nThe bus arrived at the stop.\n\nZhou Ze and the little loli got off the bus, each escorting a girl.\n\nThe bus slowly drove away, a busload of paper figures, and one old man with privileges.\n\nZhou Ze remembered reading a news report that the old man had to weave bamboo baskets to supplement his income. For a family to be supported by a seventy-something-year-old man weaving bamboo baskets, it was enough to see how poor the family was.\n\nAlthough the local government had provided several grants, which at least allowed the old man's family to get by stably, it still felt like it wasn't quite enough.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\"\n\nThe little loli stood under the bus stop, watching the pouring rain outside and asked.\n\n\"I'm thinking about crowdfunding.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"A while ago, something happened at Dr. Lin's hospital. A brother accused the hospital of not paying for treatment after his sister's car accident and started a crowdfunding campaign online.\n\nIn fact, from a personal emotional perspective, people like the old man on the bus just now are more in need of crowdfunding.\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\"There are too many sick people, and too many tragic people. Whether it's true or not, whether it's exaggerated or not, honestly, I'm already numb.\n\nBefore my previous life, when someone posted a crowdfunding request for medical treatment on my social media, I would donate a little. Later, there were too many such crowdfunding campaigns, and I really couldn't be bothered to respond.\n\nBut for people who sacrificed and contributed for righteous acts, who did things ordinary people wouldn't dare to do, most ordinary people are more proactive in donating to such people.\n\nMost people are the weak. If they can spend money to encourage more brave people to come forward and protect everyone without burdens or worries, it's really worth it.\n\n\"My boss, I think when you're being sentimental, you need to think about something else.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That is, how we're going to get back now. The rain is really heavy.\"\n\nThe little loli said dejectedly.\n\n...\n\nWhen the two returned to Liu Chuyu's house,\n\nLiu Chuyu, who opened the door, saw\n\nfour drowned rats.\n\nThe little loli clamored to take a bath and blow-dry her hair, then could only glare resentfully at Zhou Ze, who walked into the bathroom first without a word. When Zhou Ze came out with a towel drying his hair, the little loli puffed up and shouted at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"Unchivalrous man!\"\n\n\"I'll take a bath first. By the time you go in, the bathroom will be warm. I was afraid you'd catch a cold.\"\n\nThe little loli was stunned for a moment and immediately said, \"It's summer! And stop being so disgusting, no wonder you were single in your previous life!\"\n\nIf the little loli were really just a little loli, she might have fallen for this, but in fact, according to the little loli, \"Old lady, what storms haven't I seen before?\"\n\nAfter the little loli finished bathing and came out,\n\nThe three of them sat on the living room sofa.\n\nTwo boxes of biscuits were placed on the coffee table.\n\nIt was evident that while Zhou Ze and the little loli were out, Liu Chuyu, who was at home alone and injured, had been struggling with food.\n\nHe believed in the \"chicken soup\" philosophy that one must endure hardship to achieve success,\n\nAnd he felt that Zhou Ze and the little loli were people with great willpower, who had overcome the soul's aversion to eating to achieve normal eating.\n\nIt was like a form of ascetic practice.\n\nZhou Ze felt a moment of softheartedness and reluctance,\n\nHe felt that letting Liu Chuyu, this subordinate, continue to struggle with food like this might really cause problems.\n\nBut when he thought of his own limited and difficult-to-replenish Lycoris Radiata oral solution,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that it wasn't necessarily a bad thing for young people to experience more setbacks and hardships.\n\nJust like Dr. Lin back then, if he hadn't ordered her and the interns around like dogs, Dr. Lin wouldn't have achieved such excellent medical skills today.\n\nWell,\n\nThat was the logic.\n\nLiu Chuyu looked at Zhou Ze a little sheepishly. To be honest, it was only at this moment that he felt the care from his boss, who had braved the rain to bring back the evil spirits, all for the purpose of letting him share some merit points.\n\nZhou Ze didn't delay any further and opened the Gate of Hell with his fingernail.\n\nThe little loli extracted the souls from the two girls and helped Zhou Ze send them into the Gate of Hell.\n\nEverything,\n\nTask accomplished!\n\nHowever, there were two corpses in the room, slumped on the floor, rapidly decomposing and emitting foul odors.\n\nBecause the two girls had already died when the evil spirits possessed them. Originally, with the evil spirits' souls occupying them, they could maintain a state of \"life.\" After their souls were extracted, these two husks naturally returned to their original state.\n\nZhou Ze said he was going out for a walk, as the room was a bit stuffy.\n\nThe little loli looked up,\n\nGazed at the sky,\n\nAnd shouted, \"The children's channel's 'Boonie Bears' is about to air, I'm going to watch it!\"\n\nIn the living room,\n\nOnly Liu Chuyu, still bandaged, was left.\n\nHe looked at the two rotting corpses lying in his living room with some astonishment,\n\nAlong with the moment of感动¹ he had just felt,\n\nHe instantly felt like he had been betrayed.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nHe could only struggle to get up,\n\nAnd begin to clean up the now foul-smelling corpses.\n\n...\n\nWalking out the door, it was still raining, but the rain had lessened considerably and showed signs of stopping.\n\nZhou Ze didn't turn back, otherwise, he would have to face the two corpses again. Compared to dealing with two rotting corpses, getting a little wet seemed more acceptable.\n\nA walk in the rain should be a pleasant affair.\n\nIn fact, a person like Boss Zhou could find pleasure in any environment. When you cast aside trivial matters and have no obsessions, the scenery you see naturally differs from that of others.\n\nBoss Zhou walked for about half an hour. To ensure that Liu Chuyu had dealt with the corpses, and because his injury made movement inconvenient, Boss Zhou decided to stroll a bit longer.\n\nAs he walked, the sound of a bell rang out.\n\nThis bell sound made Zhou Ze frown, feeling a bit uncomfortable.\n\nHe looked up in that direction and saw a stretch of yellow walls and golden tiles. In the midst of the city, there was a small temple.\n\nThe temple gate was very small, and the temple walls were not very wide. After all, it was located in the city, where every inch of land was precious. Even Buddha felt the pressure from land prices and dared not display such grandeur as in the deep mountains.\n\nBut the fact that this bell sound made him uncomfortable piqued Zhou Ze's interest in this small temple even more.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"A mountain need not be high; it is famous if there is an immortal. Water need not be deep; it is magical if there is a dragon.\"\n\nNowadays, even many large temples and monasteries in major scenic spots or famous mountains are basically privately contracted money-making venues. In such places, Boss Zhou wouldn't mind taking photos with the Buddha statues or the Three Pure Ones, let alone visiting.\n\nYet, this small temple gave Zhou Ze a sense of trepidation.\n\nIt could make ghosts feel wary,\n\nThis indicated that the temple was truly spiritual.\n\nHe decided against visiting. Although there was no entrance fee, Boss Zhou felt there was no need to take such a risk.\n\nIt was true that he had the status of an official, but the little loli herself said that ghost messengers were only the lowest of the low in hell. Perhaps if Buddha was in a bad mood, you might not mind being casually struck down.\n\nOutside the small temple was a teahouse. Unlike the teahouses in Sichuan with mahjong tables, this place was simply for drinking tea.\n\nZhou Ze walked in and ordered a pot of bitter tea. When the tea was served, he took out a cigarette and held it in his mouth.\n\nBefore he could light it, a middle-aged man entered from outside and sat down opposite Zhou Ze.\n\nThe man was wearing a blue tracksuit. After sitting down, he casually ordered a pot of tea and kept his eyes fixed on the temple outside.\n\nHonestly, sitting here drinking tea was purely an ordeal. Ordinary tea drinkers came here, finding it picturesque to drink tea while looking at the temple, and listening to the bell, feeling somewhat elevated.\n\nBut for Boss Zhou, every time the bell rang, he felt uncomfortable, even distressed.\n\nHowever, this feeling was also a kind of reverse comfort. Just as the old man on the Yin vehicle said, once the pain is truly gone, you start to miss it.\n\nTaking a sip of bitter tea,\n\nHe frowned and shivered,\n\nAnd gently inhaled with a hiss.\n\nHe could actually taste the pleasure of being tormented,\n\nWonderful,\n\nBeyond words.\n\nAfter drinking a cup of tea, it was quite flavorful.\n\nHe refilled his cup,\n\nPicked up the teacup,\n\nAnd smelled the aroma of the bitter tea.\n\nThe bell rang again,\n\nThe hand holding the teacup trembled slightly, causing gentle ripples.\n\nHe lowered his head again,\n\nAnd took a sip.\n\nThe slight pain in his body combined with the bitterness on his lips and tongue,\n\nComplementing each other.\n\nOnly,\n\nJust as Boss Zhou was about to lower his head for a second sip,\n\nHe unexpectedly discovered that the middle-aged man sitting opposite him, who had just entered,\n\nHis hand holding the teacup,\n\nWas also trembling slightly.\n\nZhou Ze didn't pay much attention.\n\nAfter a while,\n\nThe next bell sound was much louder than before. It was estimated that the novice monk striking the bell was treating it as the last bell and used all his strength.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath,\n\nHis mind reeled,\n\nBut he still managed to steady the teacup.\n\nThe middle-aged man sitting opposite Zhou Ze let out a muffled groan, followed by a violent shake. He almost fell to the ground, and the teacup in his hand was flung out.\n\n\"Splat!\"\n\nThe thrown tea water,\n\nSplashed directly onto Zhou Ze's face.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n---\n¹ 感動 (gǎn dòng) - feeling touched, moved.",

    "content": "Boss Zhou didn't consider himself a good-tempered person.\n\nThough he enjoyed lying in the sun,\n\nand preferred to idly waste his time,\n\nin fact, if it weren't for the substantial reward points for capturing this evil spirit, he wouldn't have driven three hours and endured such arduous travel to reach Changzhou.\n\n\"Buddy,\n\nare you really pushing your luck too far?\n\nI noticed you were also trembling with the bell,\n\nbut I didn't pay it much mind.\n\nThen you actually made things worse!\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nZhou Ze stood up.\n\nThe identity of the middle-aged man opposite him was already clear. Changzhou only had three ghost messengers: one was at home cleaning up bodies,\n\nand the other two were living it up at a club, neglecting their duties.\n\nNow, suddenly a guy who was trembling like himself but also possessed a living body – what else could he be but obvious?\n\nIt was like irresponsible Western police,\n\nclocking out and ready to go home,\n\nseeing someone on the road harassing a woman. They weren't going to intervene,\n\nbut then upon closer inspection, they realized the person being harassed was their own daughter.\n\nThe middle-aged man stood up and quickly apologized to Zhou Ze, repeatedly saying, \"Sorry, sorry, my apologies...\"\n\nHowever,\n\nZhou Ze merely reached out to remove the tea leaves still clinging to his face, then with his other hand, he abruptly grabbed the man's neck.\n\n\"Guh...\"\n\nThe middle-aged man instinctively struggled,\n\nand nearby teahouse patrons and servers looked over.\n\n\"Police! Arresting a fugitive!\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted.\n\nEveryone was stunned. On streets where acts of bravery were already rare, naturally, no one stepped forward, especially since the ones \"in conflict\" were two men, not a pretty girl.\n\nZhou Ze, still gripping the back of the middle-aged man's neck, walked out of the teahouse as if it were nothing.\n\nThe back of a person's neck is actually quite vulnerable. You can try it yourself; if someone grips it hard enough, the pain can make you dizzy.\n\nHaving exited the teahouse, Zhou Ze planned to find a secluded corner to extract the guy's soul and send him to hell, too lazy to return to Liu Chuyu's place.\n\nBut this caught middle-aged man seemed to have mistaken Zhou Ze for a gangster and kept begging for mercy, saying he was willing to pay money to compensate the big boss for his clothes and such.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't help but chuckle. Why did this guy seem a bit dim? How could a soul-possessing stowaway be so adorably stupid?\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThrowing the man into the garbage pile at the alley's corner, Zhou Ze flicked his left hand. His fingernails grew, but as Zhou Ze prepared to peel away the man's soul,\n\nthe middle-aged man suddenly opened his eyes and began muttering something.\n\nThis wasn't an illusion, but in an instant, Zhou Ze felt his legs become incredibly heavy, his balance even faltering. He swayed in place, on the verge of collapsing.\n\nThe foolish, innocent look on the middle-aged man's face completely vanished, replaced by a disdainful arrogance.\n\nHe was laughing,\n\nlaughing heartily.\n\nAfter getting up from the garbage pile, he even straightened his clothes and leaned close to Zhou Ze, saying,\n\n\"You're a ghost messenger, aren't you?\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at him.\n\n\"Heh heh, some people, you just can't capture.\"\n\nThe man tilted his head back,\n\nmaking a \"Hah-hoo...\" sound.\n\nHe was preparing to spit.\n\nThe target was obvious.\n\nIn that instant,\n\ndark mist rose from the tips of Zhou Ze's fingers. As the mist spread, Zhou Ze's body, which had been bound by some special intent, suddenly felt lightened.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nBefore the middle-aged man could spit, a gash appeared on his neck from Zhou Ze's fingernails, and blood immediately gushed out.\n\nThe man stumbled backward, clutching his throat with one hand, looking at Zhou Ze in disbelief.\n\nSome spoiled rich kids always felt they had connections that allowed them to disregard low-level police officers,\n\nunaware that\n\nthe low-level police officer they encountered was actually a second-generation official on a learning experience.\n\nThe middle-aged man immediately turned and fled, not bothering with the continuing blood spray from his neck.\n\nZhou Ze twisted his neck, producing a crisp crack, and immediately gave chase.\n\nCompared to so-called reward points, what Zhou Ze found more intolerable was the man's attempt to spit on him.\n\nFor someone with severe germophobia,\n\nbeing spat on was worse than being killed!\n\nThe middle-aged man knew he couldn't run far, and behind him, a wisp of black mist was rapidly approaching, attempting to ensnare him.\n\nThe man gritted his teeth, glanced ahead, and then screamed as he charged into the temple gates.\n\nAt the temple entrance, a young novice monk and a few pilgrims were chatting. When the blood-covered man burst in, the female pilgrims immediately screamed, and the fair-skinned little novice, who was holding a broom and posing for photos with the female pilgrims, plopped to the ground.\n\nA place of Buddhist tranquility, where guests were typically quiet and refined, had never witnessed such a bloody scene.\n\nZhou Ze frowned, hesitated for a moment, but then stepped through the temple gates.\n\nAt this point, he really couldn't care less.\n\nEven if Buddha got angry, Boss Zhou would capture this evil spirit,\n\nsend him to hell,\n\nand boil him in oil a hundred times over!\n\nThe middle-aged man, glancing back at Zhou Ze chasing him, ran aimlessly deeper into the temple, passing through the Main Hall.\n\nAs Zhou Ze passed through the Main Hall, he deliberately looked up at the Buddha statues, genuinely worried that one might suddenly move and attack him with a vajra pestle!\n\nBut it seemed he was overthinking. The statues remained silent and still.\n\nBehind the Main Hall was the living quarters for the monks and young novice monks, a small dormitory-style building.\n\nThe middle-aged man directly kicked open the door to a side room.\n\nZhou Ze pursued him directly into it.\n\nThis time,\n\nthe guy couldn't escape, right!\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't afraid of escalating the situation.\n\nHe was dealing with an evil spirit, not someone genuinely armed and ready to kill. At worst, he'd burn more spirit money later to vent his own anger before anything else.\n\n\"Ah!!!!!!!!!\n\nA man's scream first came from the side room, presumably a monk taking a nap.\n\nImmediately following that,\n\nanother,\n\n\"Ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nA woman's scream echoed from the side room,\n\nhigh-pitched,\n\npassionate,\n\nmelodious,\n\nand resounding!\n\nZhou Ze stumbled.\n\nWhy was there a woman in here?\n\nAlright,\n\nthough being a monk was now a profession, and the better the temple, the higher the requirements, even needing an undergraduate or postgraduate degree – otherwise, you couldn't just shave your head and live for free.\n\nBut this temple wasn't ordinary; how could such impropriety occur?\n\nWhen Zhou Ze entered and looked inside,\n\nhe saw a fat monk with big ears, his upper body bare, pinned down by the middle-aged man near a woven mat. The middle-aged man had just smashed a vase, one hand still covering his neck wound, while the other held a shard of porcelain against the fat monk's throat.\n\nOn the other side of the mat stood a woman in a leather jacket and leather pants, dressed in a dominatrix style. By her feet lay a black leather whip.\n\nThe fat monk didn't resist,\n\nbecause he couldn't.\n\nBecause he was bound by a thick, long red rope.\n\nHeaven and Earth as witness,\n\nZhou Ze could also confirm that\n\nthe middle-aged man, let alone being injured by him and already at his limit,\n\neven if he were in perfect health, couldn't have tied someone up so securely in less than ten seconds, with Zhou Ze entering right after him!\n\nThis fat monk had clearly been tied up and lying there before,\n\nseemingly playing some sort of inappropriate game.\n\nThe woman was still screaming, her screams starting to annoy Zhou Ze. He cast a glance at her with his slightly ink-darkened eyes, and she immediately stopped.\n\nThen,\n\nher gaze fell upon Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\nHis right hand was fine; the nails were just a bit long.\n\nBut his left hand,\n\nthose five thick, hard, scythe-like fingernails – what the heck!\n\nWolverine cosplay?\n\n\"Get out!\"\n\nZhou Ze growled.\n\nThe woman immediately rushed past Zhou Ze, not daring to delay. Even though her attire was somewhat inappropriate, she didn't care. If she had to run out naked, she would have done so without hesitation.\n\nAll three people in this room\n\nwere monstrous perverts!\n\nZhou Ze's gaze fell upon the middle-aged man, who was still trying to stop the bleeding but failing.\n\nThe man watched Zhou Ze while using the sharp porcelain shard in his hand to lightly scrape the fat monk's chubby neck, having already made several cuts.\n\nThe fat monk was trembling in fear, tears welling up in his eyes, clearly terrified.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\nThe script was wrong.\n\nEarlier, outside the temple, when he heard the bell, he felt discomfort, indicating the temple had some spiritual power and likely housed a high monk.\n\nBut damn it,\n\nwhat kind of \"high monk\" was this!\n\nThinking about how he'd sat outside drinking tea, silently enduring the pain from the bells,\n\nas if his mind and body were being purified,\n\nand then looking at the fat monk before him,\n\nBoss Zhou suddenly felt a wave of nausea.\n\n\"Don't come any closer! If you come closer, I'll... I'll kill him!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man shouted.\n\nHe was waiting,\n\nwaiting for someone to rescue him.\n\nHe had snuck out while that person was away, and now, that person must have discovered it.\n\nThe fat monk kept making faces at Zhou Ze, pleading with him to back away, lest his hostage life be threatened.\n\nZhou Ze silently took out a cigarette,\n\nlit it,\n\nand took a deep drag,\n\nexhaling a smoke ring.\n\nThen, habitually, he flicked the ash.\n\nSeeing the middle-aged man and the fat monk looking at him, seemingly waiting for a response,\n\nZhou Ze shrugged, a hint of confusion in his voice,\n\n\"Then kill him already! Kill this monk, and I'll send you to hell.\n\nHurry up,\n\nif you won't kill him, I will!\"",

    "content": "The master was stunned.\n\n*Damn it, Buddha's granny!*\n\n*I'm a hostage!*\n\nThe middle-aged man was also stunned.\n\nHis gaze even held a hint of pleading.\n\n\"Could you...\n\nperhaps...\n\nhesitate a little longer?\"\n\nAfter another drag of his cigarette, Zhou Ze flicked the butt onto the ground, crushed it with his sole, and then charged forward.\n\nHostages,\n\nin Zhou Ze's eyes,\n\ndidn't exist.\n\nIn his past life, watching cop movies, Zhou Ze detested how robbers would take hostages and then spout endless nonsense. It was especially irritating in romance dramas.\n\n\"Hurry and leave, don't mind me!\" \"You go, hurry and go!\" \"I'm not leaving!\" \"You go!\" \"I'm not leaving!\" \"Hurry and go!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze rush over, the middle-aged man didn't actually kill the fat monk in his hands, because he could tell Zhou Ze truly didn't care about the hostage's life. Besides, this fat monk was too plump; piercing him with a shard and then cutting his throat would take considerable effort, not something easily done.\n\nDropping the shard, the middle-aged man turned and ran backward. This time, he attempted a difficult maneuver, trying to smash through the window glass to escape.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA dull thud echoed.\n\nThe window didn't break.\n\nThe middle-aged man bounced back,\n\ncrashing heavily onto the ground.\n\nThe fat monk, lying bound on the ground, turned his head and grinned.\n\n\"Bulletproof glass.\"\n\n\"...\" the middle-aged man.\n\nThe middle-aged man had no time to discuss with the dead fatso why a temple's side room would be so bored as to install bulletproof glass. Zhou Ze was already closing in.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man's eyes immediately focused.\n\nThe familiar heavy and stagnant feeling struck again.\n\nBut with his previous experience, Zhou Ze clasped his hands together, and black mist instantly billowed out, shielding him and the middle-aged man.\n\nThe heavy feeling immediately vanished.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze charged forward and raised his hand to strike the guy on the back of the head to extract the ghost's soul,\n\noutside the side room,\n\na man in a suit, sweating profusely from running, immediately took off his gloves.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nthe flesh and skin on his left fingers melted away, revealing bone-white hands. He clenched his fist, emitting a faint grinding sound.\n\n\"Enter!\"\n\nLawyer An shouted anxiously.\n\nInside the room,\n\nZhou Ze, who was about to strike, felt his vision blur for a moment.\n\nThe middle-aged man in front of him became hazy.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*can't they come up with something new?*\n\n*Only illusions, always illusions?*\n\nZhou Ze bit his tongue. He vigorously rubbed his fingernails against each other, and a stinging sensation spread from the base of his fingers. As the saying goes, \"all fingers lead to the heart.\" Zhou Ze was forcing himself to stay conscious.\n\nMoreover, just as the body develops antibodies after an infection, Boss Zhou had encountered countless illusions since his rebirth. His resistance to illusions was much deeper than that of an ordinary person, or even an ordinary ghost messenger.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze merely swayed,\n\nbut he didn't fall into the illusion.\n\nThe middle-aged man had expected Zhou Ze to lose himself. He knew that person had arrived. Just last night, he himself had unknowingly fallen into an illusion.\n\nBut Zhou Ze only staggered slightly, and then, a deeper blackness appeared in his eyes. He raised his palm and pressed down again!\n\nOutside the door,\n\nLawyer An felt a sharp pain in his eyes. The illusion had failed; the other party had overcome it.\n\nSubconsciously, Lawyer An wanted to rush in and rescue him, but his body stopped abruptly at the doorway.\n\nThe difference between a 'supernumerary' and a 'supporting character' is that a supernumerary's mind is solely focused on \"courting death, courting death, and courting more death.\"\n\nIt's like in the beginning of a horror movie when the protagonist senses something is wrong, and the character who immediately says, \"You're overthinking it, it must be a hallucination,\" will probably get axed soon.\n\nBut a supporting character knows when to retreat.\n\nLawyer An didn't dare to hope he was the protagonist, nor did he believe he could become one. He was just one of the countless beings in the underworld. His ability to survive all this time relied entirely on his alertness. He never believed he was lucky or had some special aura.\n\nBecause he had seen many people with similar mindsets, and they had all ended up dead.\n\nTherefore,\n\nLawyer An stopped his advance,\n\ngritting his teeth fiercely.\n\nThe premonition was strong:\n\nhe absolutely must not confront Zhou Ze directly!\n\nAbsolutely not!\n\nEven if this business deal failed, even if he incurred a lot of trouble because of it,\n\nmore trouble was still better than death.\n\nOne step forward,\n\nthen three consecutive steps back.\n\n*I'll endure!*\n\nIf, at this moment, the Land God, who had already been swallowed, were alive and present,\n\nhe would undoubtedly be cheering madly for Lawyer An.\n\nHowever,\n\njust then,\n\nthe bell, which had clearly stopped ringing, suddenly began to chime again with a \"boom boom boom\"!\n\nUrgent,\n\nhigh-frequency,\n\nchaotic yet rapid!\n\n\"Dong!!!! Dong!!! Dong!!!\"\n\nThis bell sound had escalated several notches compared to when Boss Zhou was drinking tea.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nBoss Zhou felt his head spin, and he directly knelt onto the ground.\n\nOutside the house,\n\nLawyer An, who had just successfully chickened out, also prostrated himself on the ground, his expression filled with extreme pain.\n\n*Did Buddha get angry?*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n*There's something wrong with this temple!*\n\nLawyer An thought to himself.\n\nZhou Ze, kneeling on the ground,\n\nas the bell continued to ring,\n\na blue *zao li*¹ uniform slowly appeared on his body.\n\nThere was a circle on the back with the character \"yin\"² written inside,\n\nand a box on the front with the characters \"cha yi\"³ written above.\n\nOn his head, he wore a small, low cap that looked cheap and insincere.\n\nHis entire appearance was similar to the city gate guards in Qing Dynasty historical dramas.\n\nAnd Lawyer An outside the room,\n\nalso had a set of clothes appear on him, but it was red with green, showing more vitality than Zhou Ze. An animal that looked like a *pixiu*⁴ was embroidered on the chest, and his hat had a coronet, with two long ribbons elegantly hanging on either side.\n\nIt looked much more imposing than the *zao li* in the room.\n\nHowever, a shackle appeared on his body, fastening around his neck and arms, so his posture was much uglier than Zhou Ze's when he knelt.\n\nThe shackles were so heavy that when he knelt, his buttocks were high in the air, which was truly embarrassing.\n\nZhou Ze believed someone powerful was ringing the bell.\n\nLawyer An also felt that some eminent monk was warning him,\n\nwarning him that these trespassers were Yin beings who had intruded into Buddhist territory!\n\n...\n\nThree hundred meters away from the side room, in the center of the temple's garden,\n\nthere was a pavilion.\n\nA bell hung inside the pavilion.\n\nA sign at the door read:\n\n\"Ring the bell, 100 yuan for twenty minutes! Ring away bad luck, from misfortune to fortune!\"\n\nA mother stood nearby, taking photos of the father and son ringing the bell. Beside them, a novice monk had just collected the money.\n\n\"Son is tired, can't push anymore. Father, you ring more. We paid the money, you have to get your money's worth!\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nThe man immediately began to ring the bell with more force.\n\nThese people were all ordinary humans, but each time the bell rang, the patterns on the large bell seemed to become clearer, faintly emitting a soft glow.\n\n...\n\nCompared to Zhou Ze in the room and Lawyer An outside,\n\nalthough the middle-aged man still felt considerable pain, it was much less than Zhou Ze and Lawyer An. Perhaps it was because his identity was that of an evil ghost, not an official, so the bell's restraint on him was slightly smaller.\n\nIn other words, it was like the tallest people taking the brunt when the sky falls.\n\nThe middle-aged man struggled to get up. He didn't dare to provoke Zhou Ze again. The last time, he had almost had his head sliced off by Zhou Ze's fingernails, and this time he wouldn't dare to be reckless again.\n\nHe wanted to run.\n\nHe wanted to leave this place.\n\nThat lawyer was right; this ghost messenger was not to be trifled with!\n\nThe middle-aged man stumbled out of the side room, just in time to see Lawyer An, who was waiting to be violated, prostrate at the doorway.\n\nLawyer An didn't even notice someone coming out. His head was bowed so low at this moment that he couldn't lift it.\n\nThe middle-aged man didn't help Lawyer An. He knew Lawyer An had tried before but failed to stop the ghost messenger.\n\nPeople,\n\none still had to rely on themselves.\n\nAccompanied by weakness from blood loss and dizziness from the bell sound, the middle-aged man staggered about a hundred meters, arriving at a small parking area within the temple.\n\nA young monk had just gotten out of a car and was on the phone. The car door was still open, and the engine hadn't been turned off.\n\nThe middle-aged man rushed straight over and got into the car.\n\nThe monk immediately shouted and rushed over, intending to pull him out.\n\nThe middle-aged man glared at him.\n\nThe monk felt his legs instantly become as heavy as lead, and he fell directly to the ground.\n\nShifting gears,\n\npressing the accelerator,\n\nmoving forward.\n\nIt's been a while since I drove,\n\nI'm a bit rusty.\n\nIn his past life, he had been a bus driver for over ten years. Cars were his second home.\n\nThe car began to move,\n\nat a fast speed.\n\nHe dared not delay,\n\nbecause he didn't know when this damned bell sound would stop.\n\nIf that ghost messenger caught up to him then, he wouldn't get another chance like this to escape.\n\nHe was in a hurry,\n\nvery much in a hurry,\n\nbut his condition was really bad.\n\nHis vision was hazy,\n\ndue to blood loss, due to the bell sound.\n\nThis feeling of driving gave him a sense of familiarity.\n\nThe last time he drove in his past life was to go to work after a heavy drinking session, and due to his carelessness, he caused a car accident.\n\nNot only he himself, but many passengers in the car also lost their lives.\n\nHe felt a bit bewildered, a bit absent-minded,\n\nbut he still didn't dare to hesitate,\n\nnot even daring to ease up on the accelerator.\n\nAt the fastest speed,\n\nto rush out,\n\nto leave here,\n\neven,\n\nto leave Changzhou!\n\nHe would see if he could contact that lawyer after he left.\n\nThe car sped towards the entrance,\n\nhowever,\n\njust then,\n\na woman was supporting an old lady in a kasaya holding prayer beads, as they turned into the temple gate from the sidewalk.\n\nBy the time the middle-aged man saw them, it was too late to brake.\n\nAnd,\n\nhe hadn't intended to brake in the first place.\n\nOnly,\n\nas he got closer,\n\nhe suddenly froze.\n\nThen he quickly slammed on the brakes, but due to the panic caused by the bell sound affecting his mind, he accidentally hit the accelerator instead!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe old lady in the monk's robe was sent flying. The woman was fine, but she immediately went into hysterics and rushed to the side of the old lady who had been thrown to the ground.\n\nDesperately shouting, \"Grandma! Grandma!\"\n\n\"Screeeech...\"\n\nAfter hitting the person,\n\nthe middle-aged man finally slammed on the brakes.\n\nThe car\n\nstopped.\n\nHe looked blankly out the side window,\n\nlooking at the woman who bore a slight resemblance to him in his past life.\n\nThen he looked under the old nun,\n\nat the bright crimson fluid continuously flowing and spreading.\n\nThe middle-aged man's lips quivered,\n\nand he shouted incredulously,\n\n\"Mom...\"\n\n---\n¹ *Zao li* (皂隸): A term for government runners or bailiffs in imperial China, often depicted wearing dark robes and hats.\n² \"Yin\" (陰): Refers to the concept of the underworld or the negative, passive principle in Taoism, often associated with death and spirits.\n³ \"Cha yi\" (差役): Literally \"official runner\" or \"bailiff,\" similar to *zao li*, referring to minor officials or law enforcement in ancient China.\n⁴ *Pixiu* (貔貅): A mythical Chinese creature that is said to have a single horn and resembles a winged lion.

    "content": "The bell finally stopped. That unlucky young couple felt like they had to get their money's worth, wanting to get their money's worth, so they rang it \"dong dong dong\" many times.\n\nBut their husband's stamina seemed to be lacking.\n\nThe initial rapid strikes became weak in the later stages. In the end, he twisted his sore arm and said he really couldn't ring it anymore.\n\nThe bell stopped.\n\nZhou Ze fell backward onto the ground, his body soaked in sweat, and he panted heavily.\n\nThe fat monk, bound there, saw Zhou Ze's state. The fear in his eyes was replaced by an emotion of \"looking up to a high mountain.\"\n\nAmazing,\n\nHe could get himself off just by listening to the bell!\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked at the fat guy. Now Zhou Ze was certain that there was something wrong with the bell, not with the temple.\n\nLooking at the state of the head monk of this temple, Buddha would have to be blind to think this temple had any spiritual power.\n\nThe fat monk smiled kindly. He gestured forward and said:\n\n\"There are frozen drinks in the small refrigerator, you look so hot.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nOn the steps outside, Lawyer An's forehead was pressed against the bluestone bricks, sweat dripping from his jaw. Then, he wanted to stand up, but the soreness and bruising in his knees made him unable to use his strength, and he immediately flipped over and fell to the ground.\n\nPressing his slightly chapped lips together, Lawyer An reached up to cover his forehead.\n\n\"What kind of bell is this temple's bell?\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly got up and asked at the same time.\n\n\"It's called the Morning Wake-up Bell. I bought it from a second-hand dealer a few years ago. It's said to have been used in county offices in some unknown era to summon yamen runners and laborers.\"\n\nThe fat monk explained it very well.\n\n\"How much did you buy it for?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Five thousand.\"\n\n\"I'll give you ten thousand...\"\n\n\"Now it's five million,\" the fat monk cut in, smiling at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nThen his left fingernails grew out again. He walked in front of the fat monk, squatted down, and slowly pressed his fingernails against the man's neck.\n\n\"How much did you say? I didn't hear clearly.\"\n\n\"Fifty, including shipping!\n\nA person of the cloth does not lie, otherwise, Buddha will be angry.\"\n\nZhou Ze found it hard to believe the man's integrity. He pointed at the ropes on the man's body and said:\n\n\"Did Buddha also tell you to do this?\"\n\n\"Benefactor, you are being prejudiced. Experiencing the mortal world, leaving it, and then returning to it – this is cultivation. This is also a form of the mortal world.\n\nI paid money, she provided the service, neither owes the other.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\n\"Everything that exists has a reason. Monks claim to have transcended the mundane world, so they naturally cannot view the world with the eyes of the mundane world. You find this vulgar because you yourself are vulgar.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of the white fox, who seemed to have said something similar.\n\nBut at this time, Boss Zhou didn't have time to debate with the fat monk. He reached out and snapped the two ropes binding the man, signaling him to get up, and warned him:\n\n\"Pretend you didn't see what happened today, otherwise, even Buddha can't protect you.\"\n\n\"Amitabha, our meeting is fate. Benefactor, rest assured, since this humble monk is unharmed, this matter will not be pursued further.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took out a cigarette, but found he had none left.\n\nThe fat monk, with an ingratiating look, took out his \"Nine-Five Supreme\" (a brand of cigarette) and offered one to Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou looked at the empty box of \"Xiao Su\" cigarettes in his hand again,\n\nSuddenly feeling like his own life was too simple.\n\nAfter lighting the cigarette, Boss Zhou didn't rush out. He continued to catch his breath and regulate himself because he knew there was still one person outside. That person had tried to stop him earlier, but had failed.\n\nNow,\n\nHe was still outside,\n\nBecause the panting sounded like climbing a hill during sex, thick and rapid to an unbearable degree. It was hard to cover his ears and pretend he didn't hear.\n\nExhaling a smoke ring, Zhou Ze saw the monk light one himself, apparently also a veteran smoker.\n\n\"Did Buddha also tell you to smoke this?\" Zhou Ze raised his hand, signaling the man not to answer, and said directly: \"Alright, I get it. Experiencing mortal life again?\"\n\nThe fat monk shook his head and said, \"Not really. I always encourage the employees in my temple to smoke good cigarettes if they can, drive good cars if they can, and use expensive mobile phones openly if they can.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because when pilgrims come to the temple to offer incense and donations, they are all praying for peace or for fame and fortune.\n\nIf the pilgrims see the monks in this temple all emaciated, wearing tattered clothes, would they think we are noble, ascetic, and amazing?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"In the eyes of the pilgrims, it is when we monks are well-fed and oily, driving luxury cars and smoking good cigarettes, that they believe Buddha is responsive.\n\nA Buddha who cannot even bless those who serve him, allowing them to live comfortably, how can pilgrims believe that this Buddha and this temple can bless them?\"\n\n\"You make a lot of sense.\"\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment,\n\nHe really couldn't refute it.\n\n\"What nonsense are you still talking about!\"\n\nOutside,\n\nLawyer An leaned against the doorframe, pointing at Zhou Ze, and asked.\n\n\"Is that you?\" Zhou Ze narrowed his eyes.\n\nWhat a coincidence,\n\nHe met him once at Director Lin's place,\n\nMet him once at the nightclub,\n\nAnd now met him again at the temple.\n\nDamn it,\n\nHe felt like he hadn't done any other proper work this week, only spent it bumping into this guy.\n\n\"Go catch the ghost!\"\n\nLawyer An shouted.\n\n\"You want me to catch it?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at himself.\n\nDamn it,\n\nWasn't it you who just tried to stop me with illusions?\n\nYour stance changed so quickly!\n\nLawyer An took out a jade pendant from around his neck. The jade pendant glowed red and seemed to be trembling slightly.\n\n\"He is very unstable now, extremely unstable, and might even be stimulated into a rampage!\n\nA rampaging evil spirit, an evil spirit possessing a living person,\n\nHow much destruction can it cause?\n\nYou know, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"Whether you catch him or I catch him, at least we can control him. But we absolutely cannot let him escape our control at this moment.\n\nAnd,\n\nHe is very unstable now,\n\nSo,\n\nYou,\n\nHurry and catch him,\n\nI'm done with this,\n\nI can even help you!\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips. He walked past the doorway. Lawyer An was still looking at him. Seeing that Zhou Ze was still wary of him, he waved his hand and shouted:\n\n\"In that direction, hurry!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't delay any longer and didn't have time to deal with this guy. He immediately ran in that direction.\n\nLawyer An intended to follow, but after a few steps, he knelt down again.\n\nHe was a person with a crime on his record, stripped of his literary skills. Therefore, when the bell rang, the pressure and torment he endured were much greater than Zhou Ze's.\n\nThe fat monk voluntarily came over to help Lawyer An up.\n\n\"Benefactor, should I call an ambulance for you?\"\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\n\"Then, is there anything this humble monk can do to help you?\n\nA person of the cloth is compassionate. Even the Buddha cut his flesh to feed the eagles. Seeing you in so much pain, if this humble monk cannot do something to share your burden, it would truly go against Buddha's will.\"\n\n\"Let me drink some blood, it will help me recover faster.\"\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nThe fat monk immediately let go,\n\nLawyer An fell face-first onto the ground, hitting his forehead on the threshold and forming a large bump.\n\n\"This humble monk suddenly feels that catching the demon is more important.\n\nThe orthodox path,\n\nIn broad daylight,\n\nHow can we let demons run rampant!\n\nBenefactor,\n\nPlease wait here for this humble monk.\n\nThis humble monk will first go to assist the benefactor from earlier!\"\n\n\"It's catching a ghost.\"\n\nLawyer An said, holding his forehead.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze reached the doorway, he found a crowd had already gathered there.\n\nAn old nun lay in a pool of blood, motionless. Beside her, a young girl kept calling out, \"Grandma! Grandma!\"\n\nZhou Ze rushed over first. Instinctively, he squatted down, wanting to see if the old nun could still be saved.\n\nThe ambulance hadn't arrived yet. If the injured person could receive professional medical attention sooner, there would be a greater chance of escaping the gates of hell.\n\nThe old nun hadn't breathed her last. Her mouth was full of blood, and her eyes were wide open.\n\nZhou Ze began to examine her injuries, while also instructing her, \"Relax, don't talk if you don't have to, breathe as steadily as possible, don't fall asleep, hold on.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze lifted the nun's robes and began to examine her with professional techniques.\n\nThe problem was severe.\n\nShe had been hit hard, and this was even before examining her head injuries.\n\nZhou Ze considered that, given the old nun's age, her lifespan was likely nearing its end. Even if he used his fingernails to grab her soul and put it back, it might be very difficult to save her.\n\nThe old man at the hospital last time was made to suffer so much he begged Zhou Ze not to save him,\n\nAsking for a quick death.\n\nThis also made Zhou Ze understand,\n\nThat for many people, their fate has arrived. Even someone like him, a ghost messenger with special abilities, was powerless to change it.\n\nHowever,\n\nJust then,\n\nThe old nun, somehow, suddenly found a burst of strength.\n\nShe actually pushed Zhou Ze away.\n\n\"Don't save me... let me... let me die...\"\n\nThe old nun roared, her words somewhat unclear.\n\nAs she spoke,\n\nHer body was also continuously heaving, and the amplitude of her breathing became wider and wider.\n\nThis was truly courting death.\n\n\"There is still hope of surviving, truly.\"\n\nZhou Ze tried to persuade her.\n\n\"Let me... die... hit by a car... good...\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't hear the old nun's next sentence clearly,\n\nBut her emotions were very strong.\n\nHer gaze towards Zhou Ze was also very firm.\n\nShe was simply determined not to be saved!\n\nHer body convulsed a few more times,\n\nThe old nun's body went limp,\n\nAnd she passed away.\n\nZhou Ze felt somewhat annoyed.\n\nHe couldn't quite understand.\n\nEven as a doctor, accustomed to life and death, the feeling of seeing an injured person with a sliver of hope before him, yet being unable to do his best to save them, was truly unpleasant.\n\nAt this moment, the woman who had been holding the old nun's head cried and choked, saying:\n\n\"Grandma said... she was hit by a car... it's divine will... it's heaven allowing her to atone for the mistakes Dad made back then...\n\nShe thanked heaven for giving her this chance.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze suddenly understood.\n\nThis way,\n\nHe seemed to realize who this old nun and this woman were.\n\nTwo days ago, Liu Chuyu had introduced him. No wonder that evil spirit endured the pain of the bell to linger and loiter nearby.\n\nHe was different from himself. He simply enjoyed it, like those who went to Tibet and liked posting on Moments, feeling their souls were purified, like those \"little fresh\" types who gained a sense of self-satisfaction.\n\nWell,\n\nBoss Zhou drank tea and felt \"great,\" which was a similar mindset.\n\nBut that evil spirit came to the temple to see his mother and daughter. The reason Liu Chuyu could catch him last time was that he had investigated his identity and set up an ambush outside the temple.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nBased on this deduction,\n\nThe one who suddenly appeared,\n\nAnd beat Liu Chuyu into a pig's head,\n\nShould be that lawyer.\n\nAn evil spirit who possessed a body to sneak out of hell,\n\nAnd finally drove and killed his own mother?\n\nThis story\n\nTruly had a beginning and an end.\n\nBoss Zhou looked around.\n\nBut now there was a problem,\n\nThat was, the evil spirit,\n\nWhere was he?\n\n\"Didn't find him?\"\n\nLawyer An staggered over as if he were drunk. After standing still, he clutched his knees and continued to pant heavily, clearly not having fully recovered.\n\n\"No, the person is gone, the car was left here.\"\n\n\"Then he should still be nearby, we can find him, we can find him.\"\n\nLawyer An glanced at the old nun in the pool of blood and the woman beside her,\n\nAnd asked somewhat confusedly:\n\n\"He hit them to death?\"\n\n\"Probably hit them while fleeing.\"\n\n\"Peh!\"\n\nLawyer An spat on the ground.\n\n\"Perhaps, this is retribution,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Retribution on his mother?\" Lawyer An chuckled, reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder, using it to steady himself, and said, \"I've been a human for two lifetimes, and I've only truly seen tangible retribution. Heaven doesn't bother with calculating karma and cause and effect for you; heaven and earth are not benevolent, they treat all things as straw dogs, that's what it means.\"\n\n\"Let's find the person first,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\nLawyer An nodded.\n\nHe took out a playing card from his pocket. Both sides of the card were stained with silver powder and covered with densely written words.\n\n\"Hoo!\"\n\nLawyer An blew on the card, and then rubbed his hands together vigorously!\n\nThe card ignited, quickly turning into ashes.\n\nLawyer An bent down again, panting heavily, and said:\n\n\"Sense it again, I've removed his interference.\"\n\n\"There's such a thing?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nDamn it,\n\nNo wonder he felt like an idiot.\n\nMany times he had encountered ghosts or had ghosts eating with him right in front of him, and he couldn't tell they were ghosts.\n\nHe had originally thought he wasn't qualified as a ghost messenger.\n\nNow he realized that while he had a foot of Taoism, the demons had a foot of height. They already had high-tech shielding for ghost messengers to perceive souls.\n\n\"Quick!\"\n\nLawyer An yelled.\n\nZhou Ze gave an \"OK\" gesture.\n\nIn just a few seconds,\n\nZhou Ze quickly pinpointed a direction.\n\nAfter the interference was removed,\n\nThe ghostly energy on that middle-aged man was like a white incandescent lamp in the darkness,\n\nBright enough to blind your titanium alloy dog eyes.\n\nBoss Zhou immediately rushed out. The target was not far away, outside the temple.\n\nThat location,\n\nWas a bus stop.\n\nZhou Ze saw the middle-aged man sitting there, like everyone else, as if waiting for the bus.\n\nThe wound on his neck was tightly wrapped with clothing. Although wearing a thick scarf in the middle of summer was a bit incongruous, the public had long been accustomed to such non-mainstream behavior.\n\nAs Zhou Ze approached,\n\nThe man also immediately looked at him.\n\nHowever,\n\nThis time,\n\nHe didn't run.\n\nHe seemed to have been sitting there all along,\n\nWaiting for Zhou Ze to catch him.\n\nThe bus arrived, and the few people on the platform, who were already few, got on the bus. The middle-aged man continued to sit there, not getting on.\n\nAfter the bus drove away, only Zhou Ze and the middle-aged man were left on the platform.\n\nThe middle-aged man's face was very pale. After bleeding so much, it would only be truly remarkable if he was still ruddy.\n\n\"Sit.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man patted the bar beside him, signaling Zhou Ze to sit down.\n\nZhou Ze didn't sit, just looked at him.\n\n\"I just hit my mother.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man said with a smile.\n\nThis smile,\n\nWas uglier than crying.\n\n\"I saw, she didn't let me save her. She's dead now,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAt this time, there was no need to care about the feelings of the family members, because this guy was already in front of him. This time, no matter what, Zhou Ze would not let him out of his sight again.\n\nEven if it meant not being able to capture him alive,\n\nLosing a few merit points,\n\nHe would beat him into scattered ashes.\n\n\"This is retribution, it's really retribution.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man swallowed with some difficulty.\n\nThen,\n\nHe pounded the Lin Zhiling GG card in front of him with his fist, distorting Sister Zhiling's face before stopping.\n\n\"But why is the retribution on my mother? What did my mother do wrong?\"\n\n\"Then who is the retribution on? You are already dead, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man said through gritted teeth.\n\nThen,\n\nHe spread his hands.\n\n\"I exhausted all my efforts, endured unimaginable pain, and with great luck, I escaped from hell. But now I'm a bit lost.\n\nI'm in the human world now, the human world I've yearned for in hell.\n\nBut I've suddenly become confused, and I'm not sure anymore,\n\nWhich side is the real hell!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the time, took two more steps closer to the middle-aged man, and said:\n\n\"Had enough venting? Time's about up.\"\n\n\"Don't rush, do you have a cigarette? Give me another one. I'm not running anymore, and I don't bother to run. Don't worry, I won't retaliate against society, I'm not that extreme.\n\nI'll let you catch me, let you kill me, I'll surrender meekly,\n\nReally.\n\nIf I wanted to run,\n\nAfter hitting my mother away,\n\nI could have just driven away from there.\n\nNo matter how powerful you ghost messengers are,\n\nCan you fly over and catch me?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached into his pocket, then remembered he didn't have any cigarettes, but after searching again, he found half a pack of \"Nine-Five Supreme\" in his pocket.\n\nIt was a gift from the fat monk,\n\nOr,\n\nWas it pity for him not being able to afford good cigarettes, a handout?\n\nHe took out a cigarette and handed it to the man. It wasn't that Boss Zhou suddenly became kind, but because the man had just lost his mother.\n\n\"My mother was very good to me. My father left early, and she raised me alone. But I never let her have a comfortable day. After the car accident, I died, and it was over. I went to hell.\n\nBut she sold the house to compensate the injured and dead, even though the bus company had already paid, and there was insurance. But she still sold everything she had to compensate others.\n\nFor years, she's been a nun in a temple, sweeping and cooking for the monks, chanting scriptures and praying for the passengers I killed back then.\n\nI came back, wanting to see them, and it took a lot of effort.\n\nThe result,\n\nWas this ending.\"\n\n\"If I send you to hell now, maybe you can catch up with your mother on the Yellow Springs Road,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The middle-aged man gave a cold laugh. \"I'm a prisoner. After being sent down, I'll be immediately apprehended and won't be able to take the Yellow Springs Road.\n\nAnd,\n\nOn the Yellow Springs Road,\n\nWho recognizes whom?\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent.\n\nIn many romance novels or TV dramas, a common line is: \"Having you with me on the Yellow Springs Road makes it not lonely at all, my dear, wait for me on the Yellow Springs Road!\"\n\nThink about it,\n\nWhen the handsome men and beautiful women in TV dramas commit suicide together,\n\nWhen they reach the Yellow Springs Road, don't they walk hand in hand, laughing and talking, going to hell?\n\nInstead, they tiptoe,\n\nWith numb and vacant expressions,\n\nLike zombies, walking forward in a daze.\n\nWhat about love?\n\nWhat about affection?\n\nIt doesn't exist.\n\n\"I beg you for one thing, don't send me down, I don't want to go down there and experience that torment again, please beat me into scattered ashes, let me end myself.\n\nI really don't want to go down there anymore.\"\n\nBasically, everyone who sneaked out of hell has a deep-seated fear of hell and is unwilling to go back.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"Then I'll lose money.\"\n\nYes,\n\nKilling him would only be less than twenty merit points,\n\nBut sending him down would yield a hundred merit points.\n\nZhou Ze could still tell which was more worthwhile.\n\n\"I can exchange some information with you. This might be useful to you,\" the middle-aged man looked at Zhou Ze. \"You're a ghost messenger from Tongcheng, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Heh heh, you know, I can come up from below, and when I come up, there are specialized people to receive and arrange for a hidden identity. This means that my superiors... have people below.\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to listen. As for the matter of having people below, the little loli had also told him. Since the Great Sage Sun from \"Journey to the West\" could understand it, Zhou Ze could naturally understand it.\n\nHaving connections in court makes things easier; this is an eternal truth, whether in the underworld or the mortal world.\n\n\"That person asked me to come up and investigate something,\" the middle-aged man looked at Zhou Ze, took a puff of smoke, exhaled, and continued: \"Asked me to go to Tongcheng to investigate a ghost messenger.\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened.\n\n\"Heh heh, you can go back and ask Lawyer An. According to the original arrangement, I should have gone to Tongcheng to be a ghost messenger, because there are only two ghost messengers in Tongcheng, and there's a vacancy. He just needs to operate a bit and wait for an opportunity. This is also the specific deal discussed between the person below and Lawyer An.\n\nBut look at me now,\n\nI can't be bothered with these matters, interest exchanges, and promises anymore.\n\nI just want to vanish into thin air now,\n\nI just want to find a way to erase myself as soon as possible!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man spoke sincerely.\n\nHell,\n\nHas someone noticed him?\n\nOr,\n\nHas someone noticed the consciousness within him that is still dormant and recovering?\n\nA sense of crisis,\n\nImmediately enveloped Zhou Ze,\n\nAs if a venomous snake,\n\nHad silently targeted him in the dark,\n\nAnd had already started arranging for people to approach him.\n\nIf not for the accident in the temple today,\n\nHe might have met a new colleague in Tongcheng half a year later, which is the person in front of him.\n\n\"So, don't send me down. The person that person asked me to investigate, should be you, right?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man pointed at Zhou Ze and continued:\n\n\"Don't send my soul down, just scatter it.\n\nIf I return to hell,\n\nDon't say I won't have the motivation to keep your secrets,\n\nEven if I am willing to keep your secrets,\n\nI can't withstand the torture of hell.\n\nIn hell,\n\nGhosts,\n\nHave no human rights protection.\n\nOf course,\n\nI don't know what secrets you have,\n\nSo everything I've said so far might be superfluous,\n\nBut you still wouldn't dare to let my soul go down again, would you?\n\nWhat if,\n\nRight?\"",

    "content": "Lawyer An hobbled over. He was rather slow, and it was clear his knee was still a significant problem.\n\nThe bell rang, signaling a return home.\n\nWhen the bell in the temple was struck,\n\nYou ask, how much substantive threat and harm does it actually possess in reality? Almost none. But the bell's power lies in its ability to awaken the true nature of Yin creatures, alerting them to \"attend to their duties.\"\n\nTake, for example, the皂隶 (Bao Li - a type of yamen runner) uniform that appeared on Boss Zhou. It was somewhat like the background extras on a Peking Opera stage, meant to fill the scene. According to the little loli, if ghost officials were recalled for reporting, their respective official uniforms would appear as they entered the various halls of the Underworld.\n\nThe Underworld is a place that highly values order and hierarchy; not a single mistake or omission is allowed.\n\nLawyer An was somewhat peculiar. This was because his memories of being shackled and bound were stirred up. The heavy sense of humiliation and the crushing pressure that made his knees shatter instantly, unable to stand for even a second, left him somewhat out of sorts.\n\nWhen he arrived, Lawyer An saw the middle-aged man, just like Zhou Ze, leaning against the bus stop sign.\n\n\"Caught him?\"\n\nLawyer An leaned in and asked.\n\nThen he realized something was wrong.\n\nHe sniffed the air.\n\nHe smelled a faint scent and saw that the middle-aged man leaning there was no longer moving.\n\nHe said with some surprise,\n\n\"You dispersed him?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why?\" Lawyer An was a little confused.\n\nIf the deal didn't go through, at least they could part on good terms. When he burned the poker chips in front of Zhou Ze, he had already decided not to continue. He was prepared to bear any subsequent troubles.\n\nHe couldn't just let a provoked vengeful spirit run loose in society without control. That would be more harmful than a mad dog.\n\nBut Lawyer An hadn't expected Zhou Ze to directly beat the man into scattered soul fragments.\n\nHow much resentment could that be!\n\nMoreover,\n\nThe most important point was,\n\nLawyer An, who had some experience in the Underworld system, understood that\n\nDoing so was simply not cost-effective.\n\n\"I'm happy.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Lawyer An.\n\nThe next sentence was conveyed through his eyes,\n\n\"What business is it of yours?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was right. Boss Zhou dared not let him go back down. Even though this was like trying to hide something poorly, a case of \"the more you try to hide it, the more obvious it becomes,\" Zhou Ze still didn't dare send him back.\n\nLawyer An licked his lips bitterly. The deal hadn't gone through, and if he could have sent the person back to hell, he might have had room to maneuver and explain. But now that the person was gone, and the business had collapsed, he had essentially lost an important source of clientele.\n\nDamn it,\n\nIs it easy for me to earn this meager hard-earned money!\n\n\"Let's go, there are still some things I haven't clarified with you.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and slung an arm around Lawyer An's shoulder.\n\n\"I have nothing to do with your wife.\"\n\nLawyer An immediately explained.\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"No, it's not about her.\"\n\n\"Then I have nothing to do with you either.\" Lawyer An was somewhat displeased with Zhou Ze being so close to him.\n\n\"Then what if I say I want to have something to do with you now?\"\n\n\"…………\" Lawyer An.\n\n——————\n\n\"Ding ding ding…………\"\n\nThe doorbell rang.\n\nThe little loli opened the door.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze return,\n\nAnd there was another person beside Zhou Ze.\n\nIt was the person he had met at the nightclub.\n\nLiu Chuyu, with a pig-like face, was sitting on the living room sofa. When he saw him, Lawyer An instinctively averted his gaze.\n\nLiu Chuyu even offered him a cigarette,\n\nThinking that the boss had brought back some important figure.\n\nZhou Ze sat down and gestured for the little loli to pour him a glass of water, iced.\n\nThe little loli pouted, a little unwilling, but she still went.\n\nAfter everyone sat down, Zhou Ze pointed at Lawyer An and said,\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Speak about what?\" Lawyer An shrugged his shoulders with a harmless expression, acting as if he were a simple and transparent child.\n\nThe reason he was brought back by Zhou Ze was firstly due to his weakness after the bell, and secondly because he didn't want to resist. For some reason, when he got close to Zhou Ze, he always had an ominous premonition, as if his eyelids were twitching.\n\nIt was as if something extremely malevolent was hidden within Zhou Ze.\n\nHe found it quite amusing himself.\n\n\"Tell me about your business.\"\n\n\"I'm just a lawyer, I help people handle matters and grease the wheels of relationships.\"\n\nLawyer An rubbed his hands together in front of him.\n\n\"Since we're already here, let's be a bit more honest.\"\n\nBoss Zhou took a sip of iced water, crunching the ice cubes between his teeth with a \"crunchy\" sound, and warned,\n\n\"If you don't explain clearly, you won't be leaving through that door when you go out. I'll help you open the door to hell.\"\n\n\"On what grounds!\" Lawyer An immediately straightened his neck. \"I'm not a lone wandering soul.\"\n\n\"In our boss's eyes, there are only achievements.\" The little loli reminded him. \"It doesn't matter if you have a good citizen certificate or not.\"\n\n\"Buddy, just say it.\" Liu Chuyu persuaded him. \"Who are you, really? I'm quite curious too.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu persuaded Lawyer An very enthusiastically.\n\nThe more enthusiastic he was,\n\nThe more uneasy Lawyer An became.\n\n\"My job is that whenever there's a ghost riot in hell that needs to come out, I arrange bodies and hidden identities for some of them.\"\n\n\"The subsequent services include helping them integrate into current life, encouraging them to study hard and improve every day, pay taxes on time, and become useful members of society.\"\n\n\"Be civilized, be polite, love d...\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze directly threw the empty glass in front of him.\n\nLawyer An, with quick reflexes, caught the glass instantly.\n\n\"Does it also include operating identities for them, like ghost officials?\" Zhou Ze pressed.\n\nLawyer An was a little surprised, but he figured Zhou Ze must have extracted some information when he was dispersing that ghost.\n\nAt this point,\n\nLawyer An no longer denied it.\n\nHe nodded directly,\n\n\"Arranging identities for ghost officials is also within my scope of business.\"\n\nUpon hearing this,\n\nThe little loli's gaze towards Lawyer An turned somewhat cold.\n\nThis was easy to understand. It was like someone using connections, begging, and bribing their way to become a civil servant, ready to bring glory to their ancestors and show off back home, only to find someone suddenly saying they could arrange it casually, as easily as a street vendor selling fake certificates.\n\nThis was quite annoying.\n\nLiu Chuyu fell into thought.\n\nThen,\n\nHe suddenly slapped his thigh and exclaimed,\n\n\"Damn, it was you who came out that night?\"\n\nHe finally remembered.\n\nLawyer An nodded. \"I apologize. You were chasing my client. Of course, that client is also gone now.\"\n\n\"I...\"\n\nLiu Chuyu got up from the sofa, preparing to rush at Lawyer An and fight him to the death. He still looked like a swollen-faced buffoon, a result of the person in front of him.\n\nHe had almost captured that evil spirit and was about to send it down to earn performance points,\n\nWhen the person in front of him suddenly appeared that night and knocked him down.\n\nThe evil spirit he was chasing turned around and beat him up severely, and also made him lie in a dirty, smelly garbage heap for a whole day!\n\nWhat a deep humiliation!\n\nZhou Ze frowned and said directly, \"If you want to settle this one-on-one, we'll go upstairs first. We'll leave the living room to you. After the one-on-one is settled, we'll come down.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu was stunned and looked at Zhou Ze in disbelief, his heart chilling.\n\n\"Boss, he hit me.\"\n\n\"I hit you too.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"……\" Liu Chuyu.\n\nFeeling a bit dejected, Liu Chuyu sat back down on the sofa. He actually knew himself that without the help of Zhou Ze and the little loli, let alone being injured now, even if he hadn't been injured, he wouldn't have been able to defeat the person in front of him.\n\nLawyer An adjusted his glasses.\n\nHe clapped his hands and said,\n\n\"We've met and said what needed to be said. Can I leave now?\n\nAlso,\n\nI have one more piece of information to give you for free: there are no more fugitive evil spirits in Changzhou. You two can return to Tongcheng or try your luck elsewhere.\"\n\nLawyer An stood up.\n\nHe even turned back intentionally,\n\nAnd looked at the three people present, saying,\n\n\"No need to see me out.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained seated.\n\nLiu Chuyu was watching Zhou Ze.\n\nJust as Lawyer An reached out and opened the door,\n\nA tongue suddenly whipped out. Lawyer An dodged to the side, and the tongue hit the door, closing it instantly.\n\nLawyer An looked confused,\n\n\"Is there something else?\"\n\nHe was looking at the little loli.\n\nThe little loli stretched and pointed at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"Our boss hasn't finished asking his proper questions yet.\"\n\n\"Proper questions?\"\n\nLawyer An found it somewhat amusing and continued,\n\n\"I used to work in your system too, but now I've gone into business. Although I've used a little bit of my old connections, everyone plays like this, whether it's in the underworld or the mortal world, right?\"\n\nHowever,\n\nUltimately,\n\nI'm in the smuggling business, dealing in human trafficking.\n\nYou are the officials.\n\nWe are not on the same boat now, so there's no need for any further close association, is there?\"\n\nLiu Chuyu was also curious as to why Zhou Ze wanted to keep this person. Could he really be planning to send him to hell?\n\nZhou Ze beckoned Lawyer An, signaling him to sit back down.\n\nLawyer An obediently walked back and sat on the sofa.\n\n\"Don't be nervous.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out the \"Nine-Five Supreme\" cigarettes given to him by the fat monk from his pocket and prepared to toss one to Lawyer An as a gesture of friendship.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nBecause he saw Lawyer An silently take out a pack of \"Liqun Fuchun Mountain Scroll\" from his pocket.\n\nHis hand holding the cigarette\n\nTrembled slightly.\n\nDamn it,\n\nHe felt too embarrassed to offer this cigarette.\n\nBut this also strengthened a certain idea in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nLawyer An lit his cigarette and leaned back on the sofa.\n\nHonestly, all he wanted now was to stay far away from Zhou Ze. He didn't even plan to continue the transaction in Tongcheng.\n\nNo matter how much business he did or how much ghost money he earned, he had to be alive to spend it. In front of Zhou Ze, he was as docile as a kitten, but that didn't mean he liked being a kitten.\n\nIf an ordinary ghost official dared to forcibly drag him over to play identity introduction games, he would have already slapped them across the ear.\n\nAre ghost officials that great!\n\nI was a higher-ranking official than you ghost officials back in the day!\n\nIf I hadn't committed a crime and had my status revoked, I would still be someone you ghost officials would have to kneel and bow to, calling me \"Sir,\" and lick my official boots!\n\nHe exhaled a smoke ring, and Lawyer An, with a hint of fawning, asked softly,\n\n\"You say, what else do you need me to do?\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\nAnd asked,\n\n\"How's the market for your business?\"",

    "content": "\"How's business, by the way?\"\n\nJust a moment ago, Lawyer An was all smiles, but now his expression was pure disbelief.\n\nZhou Ze's question, anyone with a brain could tell, meant he intended to muscle in. Lawyer An had just moved his base of operations to the Yangtze River Delta region. If Zhou Ze was also in this line of work, he would undoubtedly be a direct competitor.\n\nAnd you don't treat damned souls escaping from hell like leeks in a field, do you? You \"snap,\" harvest one batch, and then I \"snap,\" harvest another. You can't harvest leeks like that; they need time and nutrients to grow.\n\nBesides, the number of damned souls who manage to escape from hell each year is minuscule. The Yangtze River Delta's share is really only so much.\n\n\"Ah... it's tough.\"\n\nLawyer An sighed heavily, as if burdened by immense hardship and suffering, laced with the unspoken struggles and difficulties only men truly understand.\n\n\"Business is that bad?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It's really not great,\" Lawyer An immediately nodded. He continued, \"If I didn't have some favors to repay in hell, some acquaintances I had to look out for, I would have quit this line of work long ago. How much more comfortable would it be to just go on vacation? Who wants to deal with ghosts all day?\"\n\nAfter speaking, Lawyer An sighed again.\n\n\"It's tough.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Lawyer An's pained expression and then at the pack of Liqun Fuchun Mountain Scroll cigarettes he had casually placed on the coffee table.\n\n\"It seems it is indeed very difficult.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you say? It's difficult,\" Lawyer An gave him a look that said, 'you understand me.' \"A man has to swallow his bitter pills, right?\"\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\n\"How about this: I'll help you escape this suffering. You hand this troublesome job over to me, and then you can go enjoy your vacation. A win-win, right?\"\n\n\"...\" Lawyer An.\n\nThe little loli beside them showed a slight smile. She had guessed Zhou Ze's intentions long ago. Her boss was the type of man who'd jump at any opportunity for personal gain.\n\nLiu Chuyu, on the other hand, was a bit startled.\n\n*Damn, why am I sitting here listening to them discuss this?*\n\n\"This... it's really... very tough...\"\n\nLawyer An felt a sudden pang of toothache, and he was conflicted.\n\n\"Tough or not, think of the Red Army's Long March. For the sake of building a harmonious society, for the realization of...\"\n\n\"That's illegal.\"\n\nLawyer An interrupted Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze looked enlightened and then said with feigned, heartbroken sincerity:\n\n\"That makes it even more necessary for me to do it. Since this kind of sin and backdoor dealings can't be completely eliminated, even if you, Lawyer An, were to walk out the door and suddenly get hit by a car...\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\n\"I'm just saying, hypothetically. If you walk out the door and a flowerpot suddenly falls on your head, and you die...\"\n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"It's just a hypothetical, really just a hypothetical. For example, if you were suddenly killed by ten fingernails.\"\n\n\"...\" Lawyer An.\n\n\"Without you, Lawyer An, there would be a Lawyer Zhao, a Lawyer Sun, a Lawyer Wang, right? As long as this chain of profit exists, people will continue to flock to it. So, wouldn't it be better to have all this sin under the government's watchful eye, supervised by me? I can screen out suitable candidates. Those evil and mentally unstable damned souls, they can go back where they came from. We won't take those cases. This way, we can control the potential harm.\"\n\nLawyer An pursed his lips. After a long pause, he managed to squeeze out a sentence:\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Are really shameless.\"\n\n\"So that's a yes?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"You really want to do this?\" Lawyer An crossed his legs.\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"Not afraid of the risk?\" Lawyer An continued to ask.\n\n\"Mhm. Any method designed to make lazy people rich is basically written in the penal code.\"\n\n\"But you don't have connections. You need to know people in hell, otherwise, you can't establish connections, and the business won't work. No customers.\"\n\n\"It's okay, you have them, so I do too.\"\n\nLawyer An's mouth twitched.\n\n*So direct?*\n\n\"So, you mean you want to invest?\"\n\n\"Something like that. I can be your umbrella. This kind of thing, you can't really do it without official protection, right? At least, I can guarantee that other ghost marshals won't bother you.\"\n\n*I'm not afraid of other ghost marshals either...* thought Lawyer An.\n\n\"This matter, if it goes wrong, it could cause big trouble. I used to be in this line of work too, and it's because I committed a crime that I ended up in this state. Living in poverty, no status down there, so I can only smoke Fuchun Mountain Scroll cigarettes to get by.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"This isn't showing off, really not showing off,\" Lawyer An said with a smile, pointing to the cigarettes in front of him. \"When I was doing well, why would I even look at these lousy cigarettes?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze suppressed the urge to tell the little loli to close the door and kill them all. He took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, \"Cooperate, or not? Eight-two split.\"\n\n\"Ten percent is still a lot, you know.\" Lawyer An was a little pained.\n\n\"Knock knock knock!\"\n\nThe little loli tapped on the wall panel and said:\n\n\"Pay attention to the important parts, take notes. You get two, we get eight.\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Lawyer An inhaled sharply.\n\nAt that moment, he also felt like closing the door and killing all these shameless, flesh-eating public servants of the underworld in the living room! He could do it. He really could! If it were against ordinary ghost marshals, how else would he have obtained his ghost marshal certificate through his connections? Were they just carelessly dropped by other ghost marshals?\n\n\"That's really hard to negotiate.\"\n\n\"How about three-seven?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You... this...\"\n\n\"Five-five split,\" Zhou Ze stated. \"Are you satisfied now? You handle the contacts, the packaging, the concealment. I'll watch your back and provide protection.\"\n\n*So, you don't have to do anything and you get half?*\n\n\"If you're short on ghost currency, I can give you some. It's fine, but this business, it's really...\"\n\nThis had touched Lawyer An's bottom line. His livelihood.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to say something, the little loli spoke first, in a very smug tone:\n\n\"Our boss catches a few more ghost marshals to be his subordinates, earns some merit points, and he'll be promoted to Captain soon. His future is limitless.\"\n\n*Captain? Heh.*\n\nLawyer An lowered his head, holding back a laugh.\n\n\"You don't believe me?\" The little loli looked at Lawyer An.\n\n\"I believe you, I believe you, *puff*...\"\n\nLawyer An covered his mouth and nodded again.\n\n\"I believe, I believe.\"\n\nThe little loli turned to Zhou Ze with a pout, shouting angrily, \"Boss, he doesn't believe me!\"\n\nZhou Ze was also a bit confused.\n\n*Did the little loli get her period?*\n*It doesn't look like it. Is it too early? Has she matured this quickly?*\n\n\"Boss, I'm so angry, so angry, he doesn't believe me!\"\n\nThe little loli grabbed Zhou Ze's shoulders with both hands and shook him back and forth, like a daughter returning home to tell her father that her classmate didn't believe her dad could fly.\n\nLiu Chuyu was also speechless. *What is this play?* Lawyer An had made it clear that he used to be in this business, and he could instantly take her down. Back then, before he was dismissed, his rank must have been quite high. A captain, he probably wouldn't think much of it.\n\n\"I'm so angry, so angry, he actually doesn't believe me!\"\n\nThe little loli continued to act spoiled.\n\n\"Stop it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Noooo, noooo, I won't!\" The little loli waved her little pink fists. \"Boss, show him your ghost marshal certificate. See if the merit points are already very high!\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to refuse, he saw the little loli's hand reach into his embrace and pull out his ghost marshal certificate. Zhou Ze didn't stop her.\n\nThe little loli held up the ghost marshal certificate, deliberately jumped off the sofa, walked in front of Lawyer An, and dangled the certificate in his face.\n\n\"Seen it? Seen it?\"\n\n\"...\" Lawyer An.\n\n\"Here, take it. Look at the merit point count again. Remember, don't smudge it or wrinkle it.\"\n\nThe little loli tossed Zhou Ze's ghost marshal certificate to Lawyer An.\n\nLawyer An took the certificate and nodded, smiling. \"Okay, let me see.\"\n\nOpening the ghost marshal certificate, he first saw Zhou Ze's photo, then his name and other details. When he saw the merit points, it was only a little over halfway. *Is he that lazy?*\n\nLawyer An was about to return the certificate, acting indifferent. But as he closed the certificate and lightly rubbed his finger on the cover, he suddenly froze. Then he abruptly lowered his head and stared intently at the ghost marshal certificate! While staring, he kept stroking it, his eyes wide, his body trembling slightly.\n\n\"See? Won't our boss be promoted to Captain in a while? Isn't our boss's future incredibly bright?\"\n\nThe little loli looked at Lawyer An like a curious baby, blinking innocently at him.\n\n\"Fut-fut-future... limitless.\"\n\nLawyer An's voice was trembling.\n\n\"Then give the certificate back to our boss,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"Okay, I'll give it back.\"\n\nLawyer An wanted to stand up, but suddenly he \"plop\" and knelt down. He knelt directly in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and took his ghost marshal certificate back from Lawyer An.\n\n\"That... the bell effect... my legs are still weak... not better yet...\" Lawyer An explained.\n\n\"Oh, so the cooperation really isn't going to happen?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not happening! Absolutely not happening! How could it happen!\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit regretful. If Lawyer An was as stubborn as a dead pig that fears boiling water, he really wouldn't be able to force him. Even if they fought, while the other person might be cowardly, he was the \"cowardly but strong\" type. Even Zhou Ze, without going berserk, wasn't confident he could take down Liu Chuyu in one go.\n\n\"How could it happen! This is ridiculous!\" Lawyer An yelled excitedly. \"Five-five split is definitely not possible!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"It's two-eight, two-eight, I'm two, you're eight! It's happily decided! Thank you for giving me a bite to eat. Even truck drivers need protection, let alone people like us. You see? Right?\"",

    "content": "As night fell, the day's oppressive heat subsided slightly.\n\nBut it brought with it more unwelcome news:\n\nA power outage.\n\nDue to circuit failure and repair work, the South Street area would be without power from midnight to five in the morning, a schedule chosen to minimize disruption to normal commercial activities.\n\nHowever, for those whose shops and homes were located here, it was still rather difficult to accept.\n\nMany shopkeepers and residents stepped out onto the street, smoking, playing on their phones, or chatting with neighbors who were also cooling off outside. Inside, without air conditioning or fans, the rooms were as stifling as a steamer, utterly unbearable.\n\nThe siblings Qu Mingming and Qu Zhenzhen were no different, each sitting outside on a small stool. They hadn't opted to find a room elsewhere with electricity to endure the night because power was due back at five, and their internet café still needed to operate as usual.\n\nQu Zhenzhen added ice to her water and handed it to her brother.\n\nQu Mingming pointed curiously at the bookstore opposite them.\n\n\"Aren't they hot?\"\n\nYes,\n\nThe bookstore's main door was shut tight,\n\nAnd even the second-floor windows were closed. How could anyone stand that?\n\n...\n\nIn reality, the people inside the bookstore could indeed stand it, and were even quite comfortable.\n\nAfter the power went out,\n\nOld Daoist and Xu Qinglang, acting self-importantly, grabbed their sleeping mats and knocked on Bai Yingying's door. They exchanged a smile when they met at the doorway.\n\nBai Yingying opened the door and glared at them.\n\nShe had been engrossed in a game, on the verge of reaching the final circle, fully equipped with Level 3 armor, a Level 3 helmet, and an AWM, when the power suddenly cut out.\n\nThe sudden interruption had frustrated Yingying so much she nearly smashed her computer.\n\nBut then she remembered this high-spec computer had cost the boss tens of thousands of yuan, so she couldn't bear to.\n\nBecause she knew,\n\nFor someone like the boss,\n\nSpending tens of thousands to buy her a gaming machine,\n\nThis was a great favor and a considerable concession.\n\nOld Daoist and Old Xu, as if they hadn't seen Bai Yingying standing before them, familiarized themselves with the space, laid down their sleeping mats against the wall, and reclined.\n\nXu Qinglang stretched. His shoulder injury hadn't healed, but compared to the stifling heat, the dull ache of the injury was nothing.\n\nOld Daoist fanned himself, humming a little tune, looking utterly relaxed and at ease.\n\nLittle Monkey, perched on Old Daoist's belly, extended its fuzzy paws to count the number of his protruding ribs.\n\nBai Yingying pouted slightly, displeased, but said nothing. She continued to sit on her bed, reading her book \"The Maid's Self-Cultivation\" by moonlight.\n\nA short while later,\n\nThe bedroom door was pushed open again.\n\nDeadpool, now in a different form, entered carrying a plastic basin. The basin held slices of watermelon.\n\nOld Daoist immediately stood up, grinning, and took the plastic basin from Deadpool. He first took out a slice and handed it to Xu Qinglang, who was lying nearby, then took one for himself and savored it.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!!!!\"\n\nLittle Monkey cried out from below, apparently displeased that Old Daoist had forgotten it.\n\nOld Daoist chuckled twice and took a small, halved watermelon from the basin, placing it in front of Little Monkey. He even handed it a spoon.\n\nLittle Monkey took the spoon,\n\nscooping and eating the watermelon itself,\n\nthoroughly enjoying itself.\n\nIt even knew to spit out the seeds onto a tissue to keep the floor clean.\n\nDeadpool didn't eat. Although he had cut the watermelon, he found a chair and sat down. Whenever a mosquito or fly passed by, he would open his mouth, flick out his tongue, and swallow it directly.\n\nSmacking his lips,\n\nhe wore an expression of enjoyment.\n\nOld Daoist ate his watermelon,\n\nfree from the torment of mosquito bites,\n\nno irritating mosquito repellent smoke,\n\nand no annoying air conditioner noise.\n\nYet, thanks to Bai Yingying, the room was at a comfortable temperature, exuding a coolness in the sweltering summer.\n\n*Hoo...*\n\nSo comfortable!\n\nCompared to the neighbors cooling off outside,\n\nwith comparison came superiority,\n\nand a feeling of even greater comfort at this moment.\n\nHe wished the power would stay out tomorrow night too!\n\nXu Qinglang fell asleep first. Old Daoist covered his stomach with a blanket. Just as he was about to rest, he saw Bai Yingying get off the bed and stand by the window, looking down.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nOld Daoist asked.\n\nBai Yingying pointed west along the street through the window.\n\nShe said:\n\n\"It looks like guests are coming.\"\n\nOld Daoist secretly cursed. Guests showing up during a power outage? Did they want to stop people from resting?\n\n\"The boss isn't home, and the little loli isn't here either. Let's just pretend we didn't see them.\"\n\nIndeed,\n\nWith the two grim reapers absent,\n\nHow could they escort guests to the underworld if they arrived?\n\nWouldn't that be a pointless effort?\n\nBai Yingying shook her head. \"They're already downstairs.\"\n\n\"So what if they're downstairs...\"\n\nOld Daoist's words hadn't even finished when he heard the sound of a door opening from below.\n\nGood heavens,\n\nI locked the door before coming up!\n\nOld Daoist immediately got up and looked at Bai Yingying, asking again:\n\n\"The visitors aren't ghosts?\"\n\nBai Yingying shook her head.\n\nThe visitors were indeed not ghosts, but flesh-and-blood humans.\n\nThere were three of them, all wearing hats. One held a pair of pliers, another a flashlight. After successfully picking the lock, the one who picked the lock remained by the door, keeping watch.\n\nThe other two went directly behind the counter to start searching.\n\nThese were three petty thieves,\n\ntaking advantage of the power outage to steal things.\n\nIn fact, when the neighbors were cooling off outside, they had already noticed this place. At the time, they just remembered this bookstore's door was always locked and windows shut, so there should be no one inside.\n\nPerhaps people used to live there, but at least during this power outage, they should have left.\n\nThe reason was simple: on such a hot day, who would stay cooped up indoors? Were they foolish?\n\nUnless they kept a zombie in their house to use as an air conditioner.\n\nAs a result, in the latter half of the night, when the neighbors had all returned to their homes to force themselves to rest and the streets were finally quiet, the three of them quickly took action.\n\nThe lookout shouted to his two companions: \"Found any money?\"\n\n\"No money, damn it! How can this bookstore be so poor!\"\n\n\"I found something here! There's money here, a stack of it!\"\n\n\"Let me see.\"\n\nThe companion holding the flashlight shone it over.\n\nThe two were immediately stunned.\n\nThe lookout quickly urged them, \"Whatever it is, we're not picky. Enough for us to take a bath and get a massage.\"\n\n\"No, this...\"\n\n\"What is it? Hey, it's a stack, quite a bit, not a wasted trip after all.\"\n\n\"No, this is ghost money, not RMB.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Damn it, is the person who owns this bookstore out of their mind? Not only is there no money in the store, but they've got ghost money! Did the boss who opened this place get reincarnated from a pauper!\"\n\n\"Go upstairs and check, see if there's any money or anything valuable up there.\"\n\nThe lookout urged his two companions.\n\nSince they had come,\n\nthere was no reason to leave empty-handed.\n\nThe two immediately threw the ghost money on the ground and headed upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze and Bai Yingying's bedroom faced the stairs directly, and the two petty thieves pushed open the door to this room.\n\n\"Huh? Why is there air conditioning in this room? Didn't the power go out?\"\n\nOne of them exclaimed in surprise.\n\nOutside, it was incredibly hot; standing still, sweat poured out like a fountain, but inside this room, it was cool and refreshing, making one want to cry out.\n\n\"Let's look for things first.\"\n\nThe one with the flashlight went to the bedside and searched the nightstand. He found nothing in the drawers; there were only a few books:\n\n\"The Maid's Self-Cultivation\"\n\n\"How to Make Men Fall in Love with You\"\n\n\"The First Step for Confident Women\"\n\n\"Overbearing CEO: You Can't Escape My Palm!\"\n\n\"Dead Ghost, Go Easier!\"\n\n\"Damn, who reads such idiotic books? Is their brain fried?\"\n\nThe petty thief tossed the books aside.\n\nAs he got up to search again with the flashlight,\n\nhe suddenly saw a fleeting shadow in front of him.\n\n\"Who!\"\n\nThe petty thief immediately shone the flashlight back and forth, searching.\n\n\"Holy crap, why are you scaring me! There's no one here, only ghosts, right!\"\n\nHis companion complained, somewhat displeased.\n\nAlready feeling \"guilty of theft,\" he was startled by his companion's jumpiness.\n\n\"No, I really...\"\n\nThe one holding the flashlight couldn't speak anymore,\n\nbecause his flashlight beam landed on a corner of the room.\n\nThere,\n\nstood a woman in a flowing white dress.\n\nThe woman had fair skin,\n\na rosy complexion,\n\nand a tall, slender figure.\n\nIf not for the two long fangs at the corners of her mouth,\n\nhe wouldn't have minded adding another point to his professional attributes,\n\ntransforming from a petty thief into a rapist!\n\n\"This... this... this...\"\n\nThe hand holding the flashlight,\n\ntrembled slightly.\n\nHowever, just as he was about to shout,\n\nthe woman, who had been several meters away, suddenly appeared before him.\n\nHis neck was abruptly gripped by her,\n\nand then,\n\nshe lifted him by his neck.\n\nHis feet left the ground,\n\nThe intense pain and suffocation in his neck caused him great agony.\n\nOf course,\n\nno physical pain could compare to the horror in his heart at that moment!\n\nHe noticed with his peripheral vision that his companion was still rummaging through boxes and drawers,\n\ncompletely oblivious to what was happening behind him.\n\nHe desperately wanted to alert his companion and the one keeping watch downstairs.\n\nThis bookstore,\n\nreally had ghosts, damn it!\n\n\"Damn, this computer looks pretty good, the monitor is high-end, the specs in the host should be high too, so luxurious, rich people.\n\nI have to go to an internet café to play a game of PUBG, my regular computer can't handle it, and internet cafés are so expensive it hurts my wallet, son of a bitch.\n\nHey,\n\nI say,\n\nDon't take anything else, let's just grab the host and monitor and go, I reckon this could sell for over ten thousand, even at a cheap price.\"\n\n\"If you sell it, how will I play PUBG?\"\n\n\"What PUBG? I'll take you to eat real chicken...\"\n\nAs the man lifted the monitor,\n\nhe froze completely,\n\nbecause he just realized,\n\nthe person who had spoken to him earlier,\n\nwas not his accomplice.\n\nHe awkwardly turned his head.\n\nBehind him,\n\na cold, eerie face was smiling at him.\n\n\"You... you...\"\n\n\"You just said, you weren't going to let me play PUBG anymore?\"",

    "content": "As dawn approached, a white sedan parked outside the bookstore. It wasn't parked too close to the entrance because a police car was already there.\n\n\"Looks like something's going on at your bookstore,\" Lawyer An said, his hands on the steering wheel.\n\nZhou Ze, sitting in the passenger seat, rolled down the window and called out to a woman watching the scene nearby, asking what was happening.\n\nThe woman was very enthusiastic, or rather, she had been watching the spectacle for so long, and now someone was finally asking her. It was undoubtedly a high point for any busybody.\n\n\"They say some thieves broke into the bookstore late last night. But it seems they've all been caught. The police are here.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Zhou Ze breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nWhen ordinary people hear that thieves have broken into their home, they worry about financial losses or the safety of the people inside.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, the bookstore owner, wasn't worried about that.\n\nQuite the opposite, in fact.\n\nHe was worried about the thieves.\n\nLawyer An, after hearing the woman's account, couldn't stop smiling. On the way, he had inquired about who else was at Zhou Ze's bookstore and the general situation. Now, he quietly took out a cigarette and said:\n\n\"Ghost Blows Out the Light: Deep Night Bookstore.\"\n\nThe bookstore had a zombie and a reanimated corpse.\n\nThough those petty thieves were stealing in the bustling city, their actions caused even greater upheaval than what those so-called tomb-robbing crews stirred up in deep mountains and ancient tombs.\n\nAfter all, not every ancient tomb had a zombie.\n\nZhou Ze got out of the car. After walking a few steps, he saw Zhang Yanfeng standing there, eating soy milk and fried dough sticks while listening to a police officer report the situation.\n\nThree people breaking and entering was no minor incident.\n\nZhang Yanfeng saw Zhou Ze and offered him the half-eaten fried dough stick.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Too dirty.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng put the fried dough stick back into his mouth, not bothering with Zhou Ze anymore.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nAfter all, it was his store. It would be a lie to say he wasn't concerned.\n\n\"We're fine. Your employees are all safe.\"\n\n\"I'm asking about the three thieves.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhang Yanfeng nodded and pointed to two ambulances parked across the street. \"One of them isn't too bad; he was knocked out during the self-defense. The other two have extensive soft tissue contusions and multiple fractures. They need to be sent to the hospital for a check-up first. Don't worry, I won't let this slide. You won't have to pay for their medical expenses.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked into the bookstore.\n\n\"Boss!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying, who was sitting behind the counter after giving her statement, shouted excitedly when she saw Zhou Ze return.\n\nShe immediately ran over and threw herself into Zhou Ze's arms, with the tearful demeanor of a young girl.\n\n\"Boss, Yingying was so scared yesterday. Yingying was so afraid she'd never see you again, sob sob sob...\"\n\n\"Stop messing around.\" Zhou Ze reached out and ruffled Bai Yingying's hair. \"Good thing you didn't kill them.\"\n\nNot killing them meant Bai Yingying had held back. Normally, it would have been fine to drain all their blood.\n\nAlthough legally speaking, they didn't deserve death, as they were only guilty of breaking and entering, if Bai Yingying had been an ordinary high school student facing such a situation at home, what would have been the outcome?\n\nOh, and if there was also a man in the house who was more beautiful than a woman, the outcome would have been even more tragic.\n\n\"Boss, how could I possibly be so violent? But that guy actually tried to steal my host computer, preventing me from playing PUBG! Yingying was so angry!\" Bai Yingying said, waving her small fists.\n\n\"Oh, that's unforgivable.\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Exactly! But Yingying was afraid of causing trouble for you, Boss, so I didn't go too hard on them. I just broke a dozen small bones in each of them. If they recover well, they can still sit in wheelchairs and watch the sunset!\"\n\n\"Mmm, our Yingying is the kindest.\"\n\n\"Pfft...\" The old Daoist nearby couldn't help but chuckle.\n\nKind?\n\nYesterday, he and Xu Qinglang went downstairs and knocked out the lookout.\n\nThen, they heard a series of \"bang bang bang!!!!\" sounds from the second floor.\n\nThey quickly ran upstairs and saw Bai Yingying holding one person in each hand, slamming them against the wall.\n\nIt was like throwing sacks!\n\n\"What's wrong? Do you disagree?\" Zhou Ze looked at the old Daoist.\n\nBai Yingying also glared at the old Daoist.\n\nDare to say I'm not kind?\n\nThe old Daoist felt a chill crawl up from his feet, freezing his entire body. He then said very seriously, \"In this world, there's no one more virtuous and kind than Yingying.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Achoo!!!\"\n\nLawyer An sneezed as he got out of the car after parking.\n\nThe little loli next to him asked, \"Are you catching a cold?\"\n\n\"No, my nose just feels itchy.\"\n\n...\n\n\"It's not a big deal. These guys didn't break anything,\" Xu Qinglang said as he walked over.\n\n\"Next time we encounter such petty thieves, just kill them and dispose of the bodies. No need to call the police and increase the workload for Uncle Police,\" Zhou Ze said calmly.\n\nXu Qinglang paused, seemingly unaccustomed to the implication of Zhou Ze's words.\n\n\"Isn't that inappropriate?\"\n\n\"There's nothing inappropriate about it. As citizens, we should be considerate of the government. If a matter can be resolved by ourselves, don't trouble the government.\" Zhou Ze said nonchalantly and looked at Yingying. \"Did you hear that?\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss!\"\n\nThe death servant beside them licked his lips, even starting to look forward to the next wave of petty thieves. According to his \"godfather's\" words, the bodies of petty thieves could be used as fertilizer for him. How great.\n\n\"Old Daoist, a lawyer will be coming later. Go clean up a room on the second floor for him. He might be staying here for a while.\"\n\n\"Uh, okay, Boss.\"\n\n\"I'm going to take a shower.\" Zhou Ze walked towards the bathroom.\n\nBai Yingying immediately ran upstairs and took down the shampoo, body wash, and the boss's underwear and a clean set of clothes.\n\nThe bathroom door was unlocked.\n\nBai Yingying pushed open the bathroom door and walked in.\n\nVery considerate, very obedient.\n\nThis scene had become commonplace for the old Daoist and Xu Qinglang; they didn't even bother to look.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang still had some doubts. \"Did something happen to Old Zhou while I was unconscious? Why does it feel like his personality has changed a bit?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I don't think the old boss would have said something like just killing people and disposing of the bodies before,\" the old Daoist shrugged.\n\nThe little loli, who had just walked in, heard their conversation and smiled slightly without explaining.\n\nShe remembered Zhou Ze, whose consciousness had awakened inside her body, bringing the corpse pill back and forth between her lips and Bai Yingying's lips.\n\nWhen you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.\n\nThis influence, it probably wasn't one-sided.\n\n\"Come, let me introduce you. This is Lawyer An.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter showering and sleeping for a while, Zhou Ze woke up around noon.\n\nHe walked downstairs and habitually headed towards his most familiar spot, but stopped midway.\n\nBecause he saw Lawyer An leaning there, occupying Zhou Ze's \"Iron Throne.\"\n\nHe glanced at the coffee table.\n\nSeveral cups of Kopi Luwak were placed on it.\n\n\"Yo, you're awake?\" Lawyer An greeted Zhou Ze. \"You guys should change your coffee supplier. Seriously, I haven't had such cheap and terrible coffee in a long time.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What about your business?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I have an appointment for visiting hours tomorrow morning. In the afternoon, I plan to read some books at the bookstore.\"\n\n\"Visiting hours?\" Zhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly. \"Tongcheng Prison?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't continue the conversation.\n\n\"Are you coming with me tomorrow?\" Lawyer An asked.\n\n\"We agreed. I'm just providing the protective umbrella.\"\n\nThat prison, Zhou Ze instinctively didn't want to go near.\n\n\"Oh, alright.\" Lawyer An didn't think much of it and continued reading his magazine.\n\n\"Boss, look at the TV! Something seems to have happened at Huaxi Kindergarten. They're broadcasting live from the scene,\" the old Daoist shouted to Zhou Ze, pointing at the TV.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the counter and looked up at the TV.\n\nA local channel reporter was broadcasting live from the scene. Many police officers and crying parents could be seen nearby.\n\nThe scene was chaotic.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It seems like some thugs entered the kindergarten and took hostages or something,\" the old Daoist said.\n\n\"Oh, taking children hostage?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have the police snipers arrived yet?\"\n\n\"...\" The old Daoist.\n\nAm I the on-site commander? Why are you asking me if the snipers have arrived?\n\n\"I'm not sure, Boss. You can call Officer Zhang and ask.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He wasn't that bored.\n\nBut the next moment, Zhou Ze's phone rang. The caller ID showed Officer Zhang.\n\n\"Hello, are you busy?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nLogically, with such a major incident in Tongcheng, Zhang Yanfeng should be at the scene.\n\n\"Yeah, are you watching the news?\"\n\n\"Watching it. You can walk in front of the camera and make a peace sign, or do a promotional gesture, and shout 'Deep Night Bookstore' a couple of times.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"Go on, what is it?\"\n\n\"I wanted to ask you a question.\"\n\n\"Mmm, ask away.\"\n\n\"If someone dies, they know nothing more, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately pictured the rows of souls on the Yellow Springs Road, walking forward numbly on their tiptoes. He nodded and said, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I'm relieved.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng hung up.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his phone and tossed it onto the counter.\n\n\"Boss, quick, look! Officer Zhang is on TV!\" the old Daoist shouted, pointing at the TV.\n\nIndeed, in the shaky camera footage, Zhang Yanfeng's back appeared. He was walking towards the kindergarten with his hands raised.\n\nThe reporter beside him was making a statement:\n\n\"Dear viewers, according to the latest information we have received. Captain Zhang of the Tongcheng Police Department's Criminal Investigation Team has agreed to the perpetrator's demands and will enter the kindergarten alone without weapons to negotiate face-to-face with the perpetrators. The perpetrator's emotions are currently very agitated, but we believe that with the attention and efforts of the entire society, and with the selfless dedication of our police officers, our children will surely be rescued safely. This station will provide continuous coverage in the following periods...\"",

    "content": "The reporter on the TV was incessantly making useful and useless introductions. Before any new information came in, she could only speak all sorts of nonsense on camera in various ways.\n\nThe old Daoist glanced at Zhou Ze with some surprise and asked, \"Why did Officer Zhang call just now?\"\n\n\"He set a colossal flag.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" The old Daoist.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, a bit helplessly.\n\n\"He should be alright, right? Such a good police officer, he should be fine,\" the old Daoist muttered to himself.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a chair behind the bar counter and lit a cigarette.\n\nOld Zhang called him because he was probably a bit scared too. Fear of death is a natural human emotion. Even if he's a police officer, you can't laugh at him for feeling scared.\n\nBut he still went, hands raised, into the kindergarten.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze wasn't wrong.\n\nOfficer Zhang was now dripping with cold sweat.\n\nIt was like how girls' selfies on WeChat Moments are very different from their real appearance.\n\nNo matter how righteous and resounding one's speeches are on the award podium,\n\nWhen you truly face a situation,\n\nYour heart\n\nIs still filled with unease.\n\nOnly one class of children in the kindergarten was being held hostage by the perpetrator in the classroom. The other children and staff had already escaped. But one class of children was still a lot.\n\nPerhaps influenced by some film and television works, the perpetrator seemed experienced in certain aspects. He had actually sprayed paint on the windows on both sides of the classroom. This was to prevent snipers.\n\nIn fact,\n\nHe succeeded.\n\nAt a time like this, ordering a sniper to kill the perpetrator is itself a gamble. Unless it's an absolute last resort, the incident commander wouldn't dare to give that order.\n\nIn the current scene, the perpetrator was like a turtle hiding in its shell, cooped up in the classroom, not even peeking his head out. The sniper had no way to lock onto him.\n\n\"You, stop!\"\n\nA man's voice came from behind the classroom door.\n\nZhang Yanfeng heard this and immediately stopped, his hands held high.\n\n\"I'm not carrying any weapons, you can check.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nZhang Yanfeng turned a full circle on the spot, letting the other party see clearly.\n\n\"Send a female police officer over!\"\n\nThe perpetrator shouted.\n\n\"Heh, didn't you want to negotiate? I'm a leader from the Municipal Bureau. Only I have the qualification to negotiate with you. If you want a female police officer, I can help you find one.\n\nBringing over a young girl won't be useful no matter what you discuss with her.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nZhang Yanfeng shrugged,\n\n\"Look at my stomach, this big belly. What are you afraid of?\"\n\nA belly,\n\nIndeed, there was.\n\nFor men at this age,\n\nIt's really hard not to have a belly.\n\nThe perpetrator seemed to be hesitating.\n\n\"Look, it's already afternoon. Don't you want to wait until it's dark to negotiate? I can give you a piece of information. Snipers have night-vision goggles. At night, you can't see them, but they can see you very clearly.\n\nSo,\n\nIf you want to negotiate,\n\nHurry up.\"\n\n\"The doctor!\"\n\nThe perpetrator shouted.\n\n\"Can I use my phone to ask, okay?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng, with his hands held high, had a mobile phone in one of them.\n\n\"You ask!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded and dialed the phone. On the other end was a police colleague outside.\n\n\"Are they here yet?\"\n\n\"Boss, not yet. The people sent to invite them said the doctors are unwilling to come.\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll be here soon, already on their way.\"\n\n\"The hospital doctors said they bear no responsibility and have no fault. When the pregnant woman came for check-ups before, they had already told her that she had a history of abortions to have a son, causing severe damage to her uterine lining.\n\nThey had previously warned the pregnant woman's husband that his wife was not suitable for further pregnancy. It was they themselves who insisted on getting her pregnant again and preparing to give birth.\n\nMoreover, they did not go for check-ups at the hospital afterward. Only when she had a miscarriage was she sent to the hospital, and it was already very late. The doctors said they had done their best. They couldn't save the mother or the child, and besides being regretful, they didn't feel any responsibility.\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll be here in fifteen minutes? Okay, okay, got it.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng hung up the phone,\n\nLooked towards the door,\n\nAnd said, \"The doctors are coming soon. They will kneel at the door and apologize to you.\"\n\n\"I want them to pay with their lives!\"\n\nThe perpetrator shouted from behind the door.\n\n\"You know, that's impossible. I'm not lying to you. We are police officers, and we can't help you kill anyone. Perhaps, we can discuss something more suitable.\n\nFor example, if you want two million in cash, that's fine. We've already sent people to the bank to withdraw the money. And the car you want, we've prepared it.\n\nAs long as you can ensure the children's safety, we can satisfy your demands.\"\n\n\"Why should I believe you?\"\n\n\"Our job is to protect children. Children are priceless. Two million to exchange for the safety of these children's lives, it's worth it!\n\nAlso, I'm very curious, where do you plan to go after you get the money?\"\n\n\"Why are you asking that?\"\n\n\"Purely out of curiosity.\"\n\n\"It's better not to ask what you shouldn't. After I get the money, I'll buy another wife and have a son!\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded, deeply agreeing, \"Indeed, among the three ways to be unfilial, having no heir is the worst! I understand and support your decision. We are all men, after all. My parents only have me, their only son.\"\n\n\"The doctor? The money?\"\n\nThe perpetrator began to roar.\n\nZhang Yanfeng took out his phone and made another call.\n\n\"Boss, the sniper can't confirm the target. The assault team has infiltrated while you're distracting the perpetrator. They're ready to storm the place at any time.\"\n\n\"Oh, the money has arrived? Good, very good.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone,\n\nZhang Yanfeng let out a long sigh and said, \"The money has arrived.\"\n\n\"Bring it over to me, and the car too! Drive it over!\"\n\n\"Alright, but I have a condition.\"\n\n\"You're not in a position to make demands.\"\n\n\"Two million is not a problem, but I need to go in first and see if the children inside are safe. Who knows how they are right now? To tell you the truth, the police's willingness to negotiate and give you money is based on ensuring all the children are safe and sound.\n\nIf the children have already been harmed,\n\nYou won't get a single cent.\n\nYou'll be waiting to be shot!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng said sternly.\n\nThe perpetrator seemed to be considering.\n\nA moment later,\n\nHe pushed the door open.\n\n\"You can come in and see.\"\n\nAs the perpetrator saw the dawn of receiving money and a car, it was he who became anxious and lost. He was afraid the police would be dissatisfied and not give him the money.\n\nZhang Yanfeng was an experienced criminal investigator and had a good grasp of the perpetrator's psychology.\n\nWith his hands held high, Zhang Yanfeng slowly walked in.\n\nAs soon as he entered the room,\n\nZhang Yanfeng saw more than twenty children crouching in a corner of the classroom, and three women, all crouching with their heads in their hands.\n\nThe air was filled with a pungent smell of gasoline!\n\nDamn it,\n\nThe classroom had been doused with gasoline!\n\nZhang Yanfeng also noticed that the children and the three female teachers were also covered in gasoline.\n\nAnd opposite Zhang Yanfeng stood an old man, around fifty years old.\n\nIs it him?\n\nHe doesn't look like the suspect's photo.\n\nAnd he's so old?\n\nAnd he wants to have a son?\n\nThe old man held a lighter and waved it towards Zhang Yanfeng, signaling him to leave quickly after looking.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nZhang Yanfeng understood.\n\nA frontal assault was impossible.\n\nIf the perpetrator ignited it, the children and female teachers in the classroom would not survive. Moreover, if a gun was fired, the bullet might also cause the gasoline to ignite.\n\n\"I've seen it. I'm going out now to bring the car over. I'll put the money in the car for you first.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng said.\n\nThe old man nodded.\n\nHis eyes signaled Zhang Yanfeng to hurry up and prepare.\n\nZhang Yanfeng smiled, turned around, and took a step towards the door.\n\nThen,\n\nHe suddenly turned sideways and forcefully threw his mobile phone at the old man, hitting him directly in the face.\n\nThe old man let out a muffled groan, covering his face with his hands.\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately rushed forward, pried the lighter from the old man's hand, and then locked his wrist, slamming it down hard!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe old man was thrown to the ground.\n\n\"It hurts... it hurts...\"\n\nThe old man cried out.\n\nZhang Yanfeng's expression suddenly changed!\n\nThis was not the voice that had spoken to him from behind the door just now.\n\nIt wasn't him!\n\nNo,\n\nThis meant that,\n\nIn this classroom,\n\nThere was another perpetrator!\n\nAt this moment, one of the three women crouching in the corner suddenly stood up.\n\nHe was wearing a dress and a wig,\n\nBut when he truly stood up,\n\nIt could be seen that he was actually a man!\n\n\"Dad! Dad!\"\n\nThe man hidden among the hostages shouted twice at the old man who had been thrown to the ground by Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThen he looked at Zhang Yanfeng and roared with a contorted face:\n\n\"Damn cop, you tricked me!\n\nFine,\n\nLet's all die together!\"\n\nSaying that, the person actually took out a lighter.\n\nZhang Yanfeng's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nWithout hesitation,\n\nHe directly lunged forward, crashing into the man, and at the same time, maintaining his momentum, he hugged the man and charged towards the window.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe kindergarten classroom windows were relatively low, designed to accommodate the height of young children.\n\nBecause of this,\n\nIt was easy for two grown men to break through the window and tumble out.\n\nEven though Zhang Yanfeng appeared to have a belly,\n\nIn terms of reaction time, awareness, and combat experience,\n\nOrdinary people were really no match for him,\n\nLet alone this cross-dressing perpetrator.\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nAfter tumbling out the window, a weight was finally lifted from Zhang Yanfeng's heart.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThere couldn't possibly be a third perpetrator, right?\n\nHowever,\n\nJust as Zhang Yanfeng was about to subdue this guy,\n\nHe heard a \"click.\"\n\nFor a heavy smoker, this sound was familiar. It was the sound of a lighter.\n\nThe perpetrator, who was doused in gasoline,\n\nThe moment the flame appeared, it flared up.\n\nZhang Yanfeng instinctively wanted to break free from the perpetrator, to escape this fireball.\n\nBut,\n\nThe perpetrator, as if possessed, held Zhang Yanfeng tightly with his hands and feet.\n\nThe perpetrator's gaze was fierce and filled with deep malice.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nZhang Yanfeng had no way to break free.\n\nHe could only feel the scorching heat and the flames,\n\nRapidly spreading onto his body...",

    "content": "\"Boss, they're out! They're out! The hostages are rescued, rescued!\"\n\nThe old Daoist shouted excitedly.\n\nZhou Ze looked up. On the television, children were being escorted out by the police, reporters were crowding them for interviews, and parents were tearfully embracing their children.\n\nHowever, a fleeting image flashed across the screen: medical personnel carrying stretchers covered with white sheets towards an ambulance.\n\nThere was someone on the stretcher.\n\nThe old Daoist clearly hadn't noticed. In fact, if Zhou Ze hadn't been a surgeon in his previous life, constantly dealing with emergency scenes like this, he probably wouldn't have noticed it either.\n\nBut the news report made no mention of casualties, nor did the reporters. They were solely focused on confirming one thing: the hostages held by the criminals, the children and their teachers, had all been successfully rescued.\n\n\"Boss, Officer Zhang will be alright now, right?\" the old Daoist said happily.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"We can't be sure yet.\"\n\nAt that moment,\n\nreporters began interviewing a criminal investigation team leader from the Tongcheng police bureau, but it wasn't Zhang Yanfeng, who had gone in to negotiate with the criminals.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened. Instinctively, Zhou Ze felt that something had happened to Officer Zhang.\n\nIf Zhang Yanfeng was alright, why wasn't he the one being interviewed?\n\nAfter risking his life to rescue the hostages, by all rights, he should be interviewed and recognized.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and dialed Zhang Yanfeng's number.\n\n\"Boss, if something happened, the TV station would report it, wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"It's possible the visuals weren't suitable for live broadcast, or perhaps the official narrative hasn't been finalized yet. This could lead to delays in the news...\"\n\n\"The number you have dialed is switched off. Please try again later...\"\n\nThe call wouldn't connect!\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He looked down and saw it wasn't Zhang Yanfeng calling back, but Director Lin's number.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"A Ze, are you at the bookstore?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Come to my hospital. The hospital just received two severely burn patients. One of them is a police officer, and he's in critical condition. I need your help.\"\n\n\"Is the police officer's surname Zhang?\"\n\n\"Yes, surname Zhang.\"\n\n\"I'll be right there.\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately got up and walked towards the door. Lawyer An looked at him with curiosity.\n\n\"Drive me to the hospital.\"\n\nLawyer An's car was parked right in front of the bookstore.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nLawyer An didn't ask any further questions, directly took out the car keys, got up, opened the car door, and got in.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the passenger seat and urged, \"Hurry up.\"\n\n\"No problem.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, the car pulled into Director Lin's private hospital.\n\nSeveral police cars were already parked at the entrance. As Zhou Ze walked in quickly, he saw more than ten worried police officers standing in the hallway outside the operating room.\n\nHe recognized several of them; they were Zhang Yanfeng's subordinates.\n\nSome female police officers were crying, and the male officers had tears in their eyes.\n\nDamn it,\n\nIs old Zhang really going to be sacrificed?\n\nTaking out his phone, Zhou Ze called Director Lin. The call went unanswered and was immediately disconnected.\n\nBut soon, a young nurse ran towards Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze followed her into the locker room, changed into medical attire with the nurse's help, and walked through the hallway, passing between the group of police officers.\n\nThe nurse pushed open the door, and Zhou Ze entered the operating room.\n\n...\n\n\"Beep... beep... beep...\"\n\nThe sounds of various machines in the operating room and the hurried movements of several doctors and nurses around the operating table all indicated how dire and complex the situation was.\n\nEspecially the beeping of the monitoring equipment, which was particularly annoying.\n\nFor ordinary people, it didn't matter if they didn't know what these monitoring devices were for; as long as they were quiet, there was usually no problem.\n\nBut now,\n\nthe problem was undeniably severe.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Director Lin, who moved aside to make space for him and introduced, \"Severe burns, over eighty percent of the body surface area burned. We are cleaning the wounds. You'll be in charge from now on.\"\n\nDirector Lin didn't know Zhou Ze's relationship with Zhang Yanfeng. She had asked Zhou Ze to come because she wanted to use all her abilities to save the patient's life. The patient was brought in after fighting with the criminal who had gasoline on him, and was burned while protecting the kindergarten children.\n\nOn the operating table,\n\nOfficer Zhang's clothes had been cut away. The entire person,\n\nor rather,\n\nif one could still call it a person.\n\nThe burned area was terrifying; even the face was distorted.\n\nIn the air,\n\nthe aroma of roasted meat still lingered. It was a genuine meaty aroma, but it wouldn't arouse anyone's appetite in the operating room.\n\nZhou Ze placed his hands on the operating table, taking deep breaths. He needed to calm down, desperately needed to calm down.\n\nZhou Ze knew how difficult it was to manage extensive burns and how high the mortality rate was. Doctors could only play a role of doing their best and leaving the rest to fate.\n\nSeveral doctors around were still cleaning the wounds. The specific condition of the injuries would be determined by the results of the cleaning.\n\n\"Inhalation injury assessment?\" Zhou Ze entered the zone and asked.\n\nInhalation injuries were common at fire scenes. Patients who cried out at the scene of a fire inhaled a large amount of dust and heat, which could cause severe damage to the respiratory tract. On one hand, it could cause swelling of the airway leading to suffocation; on the other hand, it could cause severe damage to the lung tissue, leading to serious lung infections later.\n\n\"No major issues. We've asked. He was burned by gasoline.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nSo, the concerns now were shock and infection. Generally, the three main reasons for the high mortality rate in extensive burns were inhalation injuries, shock, and infection.\n\nEach was like a gate of hell. Whether one could pass through it truly depended on luck.\n\nAs for Officer Zhang's horribly disfigured face from the burns, Zhou Ze wasn't too saddened. As long as the person could be saved, Boss Zhou was even willing to help him with free skin grafts and cosmetic surgery.\n\nHe wouldn't mind transplanting good skin from his buttocks to his face.\n\nFrom the afternoon until late at night, Zhou Ze and the team finally completed the first stage of surgery and walked out of the operating room.\n\nA group of police officers and police leaders immediately stepped forward to anxiously inquire about the situation. There seemed to be reporters outside as well.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered with these people. He left Director Lin to handle them. He went directly to Director Lin's office. On the way, he saw Lawyer An sitting at the nurse's station, chatting animatedly with a young nurse.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze approaching, Lawyer An immediately stopped the conversation, handed the nurse his business card, and then walked over.\n\n\"How is it? Is the situation okay?\" Lawyer An asked. \"I saw the news. It said that police officer was fighting with the criminal who had gasoline on him to protect the children, and they were both burned. He's a good police officer.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"The situation is not optimistic. We just finished surgery, and he's now entering the anti-shock treatment phase.\"\n\nThere was a sink in the office. Zhou Ze took off his gloves and washed his face with cold water.\n\n\"I don't understand medicine,\" Lawyer An shrugged. \"How long does anti-shock treatment take?\"\n\n\"48 hours.\"\n\n\"So, he just needs to get through 48 hours?\"\n\n\"That's just the first hurdle. If he gets infected later, it will be very difficult to manage,\" Zhou Ze said, looking up and picking up Director Lin's towel to wipe his face.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nLawyer An pursed his lips and rubbed his nose.\n\n\"If...\" Zhou Ze began.\n\n\"If what?\"\n\n\"If he dies, can his soul be kept here?\"\n\n\"What?\" Lawyer An asked, a little surprised.\n\n\"If he dies, can his soul be kept here?\"\n\n\"He wasn't wrongfully killed, so he won't turn into a vengeful spirit. If he truly dies, it will be as a sacrifice. Such a person will probably go through the whole process of going to hell. If he's recognized and a memorial service is held for him in the mortal world, he'll suffer much less and receive some preferential treatment in hell.\"\n\n\"I mean, is there a way to bring him back?\"\n\n\"Heh heh, you're thinking too much.\"\n\n\"A grim reaper did that to me before.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Can you compare yourself to him, an ordinary person?\" Lawyer An said, sounding somewhat absurd.\n\nIf you're the same as him,\n\nwhy would I share 20% with you?\n\n\"Can't you guide ghosts here?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I have a few grim reaper badges here. I can give them to him to use. Tongcheng is also in need of a grim reaper!\"\n\n\"This is almost impossible. I'm responsible for extraditing escaped evil spirits from hell. There are specific conditions for that. How many souls are there in the underworld? Countless.\n\nUnless he participates in the prison break riot after going to hell, and succeeds, and is among the successful escapees. This isn't one in ten thousand; the difficulty is like dropping a drop of water into the ocean and then trying to find the same drop again!\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips,\n\ngrabbing his hair with one hand.\n\n\"There must be a way, there must be.\"\n\n\"Those souls that you can send to hell are inherently disobedient or have obsessions. Does he have any obsessions?\n\nFurthermore, if you forcefully keep his ordinary soul, it will only cause his soul to dissipate continuously.\n\nIn other words, you, me, and other stowaways are all special cases born out of great luck.\n\nIf it could be done in batches, it would truly be like one person achieving enlightenment and their whole family ascending. Not only would they not die themselves, but they could also bring their whole family along. Is there such a good thing?\"\n\n\"Shut up, let me have some quiet.\"\n\n\"...\" Lawyer An.\n\nJust then,\n\na nurse ran over anxiously, stopping at the office door, panting as she shouted to Zhou Ze,\n\n\"Dr. Xu, Director Lin asked me to call you.\n\nShe said... she said...\n\nShe said the patient has entered a state of severe shock.\"",

    "content": "Outside the Intensive Care Unit, Zhou Ze sat against the wall in the corridor, a burning cigarette dangling from his fingers, a pile of cigarette butts at his feet.\n\nOld Zhang was still inside, his condition not improving, but rather continuously deteriorating.\n\nA whole night had passed.\n\nPerhaps for Old Zhang, another night had been shaved off his life. His remaining life could be counted on fingers, not in days, but in hours.\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze was reluctant to admit it, as a doctor with professional integrity, he knew clearly that in terms of his condition and the treatment methods available, Old Zhang was truly beyond saving.\n\nNot all illnesses can expect miracles. People always like to promote the spirit of optimism and positivity, believing it can create miracles and conquer diseases.\n\nBut that is merely a way for people to console themselves, a natural instinct.\n\nOtherwise, hospitals wouldn't need doctors; they could just hire motivational speakers who give pep talks to high school students to lecture patients and cure them.\n\nHe crushed the cigarette butt in his hand onto the tiled floor.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head,\n\nclosing his eyes slightly.\n\nRather than continuing to observe the situation, he was waiting for Old Zhang's soul to appear after his death.\n\nAt least,\n\nhe could have a few last words with Old Zhang,\n\nchat a bit,\n\nask Old Zhang if he had any regrets,\n\nand if he had a habit of digging holes everywhere or hiding passbooks under the sofa. Zhou Ze could help find them and hand them over to his son or ex-wife.\n\nBirth, aging, sickness, and death,\n\nthe cycle of yin and yang,\n\neven if you become a ghost messenger, you still cannot resist this general trend, nor can you truly change it.\n\nBoss Zhou hadn't felt this powerless in a long time. The last time he felt this way was many years ago, when he had just entered the profession, still full of ideals, dreams, and that pure desire.\n\nBut after one failed resuscitation after another, seeing patients finally pass away,\n\nthat powerlessness, that paleness, that sense of failure and despondency,\n\nwas the most tormenting.\n\nBut later, he got used to it.\n\nZhou Ze chuckled.\n\nHe originally thought that after becoming a ghost messenger, he could change some things, but in the end, it was just reliving the emotions he had been unwilling to face before.\n\nThis feeling,\n\nit's really not good.\n\nBut what needs to be let go of, you have to let go of, whether you want to or not.\n\n\"You must be in a lot of pain too, right?\"\n\nOld Zhang inside the ICU must have been in a lot of pain.\n\nDeath,\n\nperhaps for him, it was truly a release.\n\nJust like when Zhou Ze wanted to save the old man whose lifespan had ended, that person might have just wanted a quick end.\n\nLying there with extensive burns, even if unconscious and injected with anesthetics, the pain was unavoidable.\n\nAn ordinary person would suffer for two nights from a simple appendectomy, let alone the current situation.\n\nWith this thought,\n\nZhou Ze felt better.\n\nAfter Old Zhang dies, after he is freed from his pain,\n\nZhou Ze could have another smoke with him while his soul hasn't gone to the underworld,\n\nchat and brag a bit,\n\nit seemed,\n\nquite pleasant.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nthe shadow and oppression of death had dissipated a lot at this moment, and it was no longer so difficult to accept.\n\nRushed footsteps were heard from outside.\n\nIt should be Old Zhang's subordinates or people from the bureau coming to see him.\n\nSince Old Zhang was sent to the emergency room yesterday afternoon, visitors had been endless. Many rushed over immediately after their shifts ended, just to accompany Old Zhang outside the ward.\n\nLogically, with his personality, his popularity shouldn't be this high.\n\nPerhaps, it's also because he's close to death. As people are about to die, past grievances become irrelevant, and what remains is respect for his personal character and integrity.\n\nHowever, the person arriving this time seemed a bit young.\n\nHe was wearing jeans and a blue T-shirt. After running over, he directly faced the window and shouted at Old Zhang in the ICU:\n\n\"Dad! Dad! Dad!!!\"\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nHe looked up at the young man.\n\nSeeing him having the urge to force open the ICU door,\n\nBoss Zhou immediately stood up and placed his hand on the young man's shoulder:\n\n\"Don't be impulsive.\"\n\nThe young man's body trembled. He took a deep breath, but tears were already uncontrollably streaming from his eyes. He finally leaned against the wall, slowly sat down, held his head, and cried.\n\nBoss Zhou stood beside him, watching the young man vent his emotions.\n\nAfter a long while,\n\nthe young man looked up at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"How is my dad, Doctor?\"\n\nHe should have received a notification before arriving. He would have likely called to inquire on his way back. Such matters don't need to be hidden and shouldn't be hidden. Families have the right to know the real situation.\n\nSo, the reason he was asking Zhou Ze now was merely to seek some psychological comfort.\n\nNot many people have the courage to face harsh reality squarely. Most people need to be coaxed. If no one is there to coax them, they coax themselves.\n\nBut unfortunately,\n\nhe asked the wrong person.\n\n\"Oh, he's about to die.\"\n\n\"…………\" The young man.\n\nIt was conceivable that\n\nif Old Zhang's son hadn't been a police academy student, inheriting some of Old Zhang's good qualities,\n\nand it were someone else,\n\nZhou Ze would definitely be beaten up by now.\n\n\"I did my best, but there was nothing I could do. His burns were too extensive, and his post-operative response was very poor,\" Zhou Ze continued. \"It's 8 AM now. If he makes it to tonight, it'll be remarkable. Surviving past tonight would be a miracle.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it. I think my dad won't die,\" the young man said through gritted teeth.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the young man's head, comforting his last bit of stubbornness.\n\nHe treated Old Zhang as a brother, so this young man was naturally considered Zhou Ze's nephew.\n\n\"Where is your mother?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe hospital had issued the critical illness notice long ago, and Director Lin had also informed the police bureau about the specific situation.\n\n\"She lives abroad. She called me, but she can't return for now,\" the young man replied. \"According to you, doctor, she wouldn't make it back in time.\"\n\nA \"naked official\"¹?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, thinking that after Old Zhang kicked the bucket, he would have to have a good talk with his departed soul. As a police cadre, he let his ex-wife seek refuge in America, which has a hostile intention towards China. It seems his family ideological work was not thorough enough.\n\n\"And my mother's current husband is also hospitalized, so she can't come back either.\"\n\nThe young man slowly stood up. He first glanced at the cigarette butts on the ground, then took out a cigarette from his pocket and offered one to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette,\n\nnodded,\n\nso it wasn't a \"naked official\" then?\n\nAfter all, he was married.\n\nFortunately, the young man didn't know what Zhou Ze was thinking, otherwise, even the best demeanor wouldn't stop him from wanting to hit someone.\n\nTo be honest, Old Zhang was quite pitiful. His family troubles were second only to Zhou Ze's childhood friend, Old Wang,\n\nbut he still couldn't reach Old Wang's level.\n\nZhou Ze always felt that if Wang Ke were willing, he could write a book based on his experiences, and it would be even more popular than those so-called sentimental novels.\n\nAt that time, he would set up a special section in bookstores for his book, with this as the main theme.\n\n\"I never thought my dad was a good father,\" the young man said.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze agreed wholeheartedly.\n\n\"But he was a good policeman.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze still agreed wholeheartedly.\n\n\"Now, he's about to die,\" the young man sighed. \"Even now, I have this illusion that he will survive, just like every time before when he went out on missions to apprehend fugitives, and my mother and I were worried sick at home, but he would still return home the next day.\"\n\n\"I have some good news for you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What good news?\"\n\n\"That criminal didn't make it through last night. He's dead.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" the young man said.\n\nHe wasn't thinking about revenge at the moment, only about his father's safety.\n\nZhou Ze felt a little uncomfortable because when that person died, he was busy performing surgery on Zhang Yanfeng. By the time he went there, the soul had already gone to the underworld and couldn't be found.\n\nIf he had been at the scene then, he would never have let that person die so easily and cleanly. While the person was alive, it was inconvenient for Zhou Ze to act, but after his death, he would fall under Zhou Ze's control.\n\nNo matter how much grievance or misfortune one suffers in society and life, those who inflict their anger and harm onto their children are not worthy of sympathy.\n\nAt this moment, there was another stir outside.\n\nTurning his head, he saw a group of children, with their parents standing behind them.\n\nEach child was holding a bouquet of flowers, some also holding paper cranes and airplanes they had folded. They walked over quietly together, while the adults stayed behind.\n\nThese were\n\nthe children Zhang Yanfeng had saved from the criminal.\n\nThe children might not understand gratitude, as they were only in kindergarten. They probably didn't understand any profound truths, and many of them might not even remember yesterday's events due to excessive fright.\n\nBut their parents remembered. They organized everyone in the parents' WeChat group to come, and even the busiest parents took leave to accompany their children.\n\nWhen these children grow up, their parents will tell them about this event, and in the future, these children will believe that there are good policemen in this world, because their lives were saved by a police uncle.\n\nLooking at this scene, watching the children neatly place the flowers and paper cranes outside the ICU, the young man cried again, burying his head deeply, sobbing intensely.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively reached for another cigarette, but looking at the children around, he put it back.\n\nTwo of the bolder children crawled to the window to peek inside. Seeing Zhang Yanfeng lying there, one was startled and retreated, while the other started crying directly.\n\nIt was really,\n\ntoo scary!\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nZhou Ze chuckled.\n\nWhile laughing, Zhou Ze put his arm around the young man's shoulder and pointed at the crying child, indicating for him to look.\n\nThe young man looked up.\n\nWhile crying, he looked at the child and also started laughing.\n\nLaughing,\n\ntears streamed down his face…\n\n¹ **\"Naked Official\"**: A term in China referring to a government official whose spouse and children have emigrated overseas, leaving them vulnerable to corruption and flight.",

    "content": "Iron bars, glass, a telephone;\n\nNo matter what Boss Zhou was busy with, Lawyer An had to make time to do what he needed to do. Even though his business was now an 80/20 split with Zhou Ze, it hadn't dampened his passion for his work.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nThis job, it earned goodwill, goodwill from both the underworld and the surface world. The fact that he split eighty percent with Zhou Ze was an investment of affection. As for the spirit money he handled midway and the improved quality of life that came with it, Lawyer An saw them as mere byproducts.\n\nActually,\n\nHe still didn't understand,\n\nWhy Boss Zhou, who ran a bookstore,\n\nLiked money so much?\n\nMoney, what's so good about it?\n\nIt stinks,\n\nSo dirty.\n\nThe prisoner sat down and picked up the telephone, his expression somewhat gloomy.\n\nIt was evident,\n\nThat during his time in prison lately, he might have been living a bit too comfortably. Yes, on the receiving end of comfort, like dew on a morning flower's bud, tender and alluring.\n\n\"Get me out of here!\"\n\nHis first words upon opening the door were a demand for release.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Lawyer An flatly refused.\n\n\"Do you want to swap places and come in here? How do you think that would feel?\" The prisoner was getting emotional, \"Let me tell you, I can't take it anymore. These guys, they bully me every single day!\"\n\n\"If you can't take it, you can go on a killing spree in prison.\"\n\nLawyer An took out a nail clipper and began trimming his nails.\n\n\"If you can't even handle something like this, I'm sorry, but I can't possibly let you go free, because it means you'll just cause trouble for me again when you get out.\"\n\nThe conversation,\n\nFell into silence.\n\nFew who could emerge from hell were meek. How could someone who was amiable, good-natured, and sought no conflict possibly think about rioting and escaping?\n\nTherefore, a large portion of Lawyer An's energy was spent on \"taming eagles.\"\n\nGrinding off their sharp edges, making them understand the rules of the mortal world.\n\n\"How much longer do I have to stay?\"\n\n\"Two months.\"\n\n\"Why is it extended?\"\n\n\"Because today's conversation has disappointed me.\" Lawyer An shrugged.\n\n\"You, you're shameless!\"\n\n\"Please, I only earn spirit money. But if something goes wrong, and some inspector suddenly comes to check things out, I could lose my life.\n\nSo,\n\nPlease,\n\nShut up,\n\nAnd obediently enjoy your life in prison.\"\n\n\"That person, he contacted me.\" The prisoner spoke up.\n\n\"Which person? Down below? You still have the ability to contact the underworld from here?\"\n\nLawyer An frowned. He disliked situations where his underworld clients interfered with his arrangements, as it could disrupt his \"taming eagles\" plan.\n\n\"No, the one I told you about last time, the one who got his sentence reduced by writing in prison.\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nLawyer An slammed both hands on the glass, his eyes fixed on the prisoner in front of him.\n\n\"Hey, pay attention!\"\n\nFrom a distance, a guard pointed and issued a warning.\n\nLawyer An gestured an apology in that direction, then sat back down, saying with a gloomy expression, \"I remember I warned you not to get close to that person.\"\n\n\"I didn't get close to him, he approached me.\"\n\n\"What? He approached you?\"\n\n\"Yes, he approached me himself, saying he needed to find a lawyer. He knew I had a good lawyer, so he hoped I would introduce you to him.\"\n\nLawyer An's expression shifted through various shades of uncertainty. That person, wanted to find him?\n\n\"Did he really say that?\"\n\n\"Why would I lie to you? Also, you can go to the prison authorities now and say you want to be his lawyer. You should be arranged to meet soon.\n\nBecause he's a model inmate, a propaganda showcase, the prison will definitely accommodate this. Besides, he'll be released in a year.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nLawyer An nodded.\n\nThe call ended,\n\nThe prisoner was escorted back to his cell by the guard,\n\nLawyer An slowly packed his briefcase.\n\nWalking out, after smoking a few cigarettes in the smoking area, Lawyer An contacted the prison authorities. After explaining his intentions, the prison indeed made accommodations.\n\nOf course,\n\nLawyer An also received feedback: the other party's request to see a lawyer had been submitted yesterday.\n\nAbout an hour later,\n\nStill in the same visitation room,\n\nLawyer An sat down again.\n\nHis fingers tapped lightly on his briefcase. Honestly, he was a bit nervous.\n\nThis person was completely different from his previous clients. Before, he was the one seeking them out, but this time, the client was seeking him.\n\nHe really wanted to refuse, truly wanted to refuse, but curiosity was a cat's killer. Lawyer An really wanted to know why the other person wanted to see him!\n\nThe door opened,\n\nHe walked in, not even handcuffed. Even the guard escorting him smiled at him.\n\nYes,\n\nThis kind of prisoner,\n\nIn the eyes of the prison authorities,\n\nWas like a three-good student in the eyes of a teacher.\n\nAnd with less than a year until his release, he was indeed reassuring.\n\nThe other person sat down across the glass.\n\nHe didn't speak.\n\nLawyer An maintained his seated posture, legs crossed, and also remained silent, but the muscles in his legs were already growing stiff.\n\nAfter a moment,\n\nLawyer An grabbed his thigh with one hand, placed it down, took a deep breath, and picked up the receiver.\n\nSeeing Lawyer An's action, the other person also picked up his receiver and put it to his ear.\n\n\"Gulp...\"\n\nLawyer An swallowed.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\nAfter the brief and direct greetings, Lawyer An finally asked again:\n\n\"You... were looking for me?\"\n\nThe other person nodded.\n\n\"What do you need my help with...?\"\n\nThe other person shook his head.\n\n\"This...\"\n\nWhy the hell did you look for me?\n\n\"We don't need to do anything.\" The other person spoke.\n\n\"Do nothing? Wait, 'we'?\"\n\nLawyer An emphasized the word \"we.\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"May I ask who else this 'we' represents? My clients? Or the one from the underworld?\"\n\nThe other person shook his head.\n\n\"Then what does it refer to?\"\n\n\"Where do you live now?\"\n\n\"I live in...\"\n\nLawyer An understood.\n\n\"Don't do anything. That's how it is for now.\"\n\n\"We haven't done anything recently. You wouldn't believe how decadent the bookstore I live in is. Everyone in the family is a lazy bum. All we do all day is nothing.\"\n\n\"So tiring.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Talking to you.\"\n\n\"Talking to me is tiring?\"\n\nThe other person nodded.\n\n\"...\" Lawyer An.\n\n\"I don't like talking much. I prefer to write, to write stories.\"\n\n\"Mmm, I know that.\"\n\n\"I just finished an article recently, but due to subject matter restrictions, it's very difficult to publish.\n\nIn China, the environment is very strict on literary creations involving the supernatural. It easily strays into promoting feudal superstitions. The magazines and newspapers that used to publish my work have all rejected it this time.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Although I couldn't publish it outside, the prison still featured it in their internal journal. When you leave, you can ask at the gatehouse for a copy. It's quite an interesting short story.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThen,\n\nSilence again.\n\n\"Anything else?\" Lawyer An asked.\n\nThe other person shook his head.\n\n\"Can I leave then?\"\n\nThe other person nodded.\n\nLawyer An was speechless, but he didn't rush to leave. Instead, he smiled and said, as if joking:\n\n\"I heard that back then, you yourself...\"\n\nThe other person suddenly looked up,\n\nSomewhat confused,\n\nSomewhat vacant.\n\nLawyer An's words immediately stopped.\n\nSilence,\n\nMore silence.\n\nThe other person opened his mouth, then sighed and said, \"That was my fault.\"\n\n\"Uh... I shouldn't have asked.\"\n\n\"That's why they say curiosity kills the cat.\" The other person smiled and continued, \"If you get run over by a car one day, don't complain.\"\n\n\"I'll be careful.\"\n\nWith that, Lawyer An stood up.\n\n\"What about the payment? Don't you want it?\" the other person asked.\n\nLawyer An sat back down.\n\n\"It's a shame, but if you wanted it, I wouldn't have anything to give you.\"\n\nThe other person seemed regretful.\n\nLawyer An immediately stood up and walked out with his briefcase.\n\nBaby's angry,\n\nDon't mess with me like this!\n\nWalking all the way out, Lawyer An decided to drive back early. Before returning to the bookstore, he could go eat something himself and order the famous dish \"Er Feng Peng Zhu\"¹ to satisfy his palate.\n\nPassing by the guardhouse,\n\nLawyer An seemed to remember something and walked over, knocking on the window.\n\n\"What is it?\" The guard inside opened the window and asked.\n\n\"Comrade, do you have any journals here? The prison's internal one.\"\n\n\"What do you need this for?\" The other person was somewhat curious.\n\nMost people are too lazy to read the journals and magazines from their own units. If it weren't for the inconvenience of using them for hygiene, they'd probably be gathered in the toilet for destruction.\n\n\"Oh, I have an article published in here by one of my clients. He asked me to take a copy back for his elderly mother. He's finally won an award for his writing.\"\n\nThe guard searched on the desk and handed out a thin magazine.\n\nThe magazine was thin, of course. Most magazines these days aren't thick if you remove the advertising pages.\n\nNo business would be so foolish as to sponsor a prison's internal journal.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nLawyer An said gratefully and took the magazine to the parking lot.\n\nStarting the car and turning on the air conditioning, the car interior was still hot and stuffy from the sun. Lawyer An had to stand outside for a while, letting the air conditioning lower the temperature inside.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and smoked.\n\nCasually picking up the magazine,\n\nThe cover was roughly printed,\n\nBut the magazine's name was powerful:\n\n\"Prison Stories.\"\n\n\"Tsk tsk.\" Lawyer An clicked his tongue, flipping through it casually. The guy's article was at the end.\n\nThe title was \"Untitled.\"\n\nLawyer An remembered reading many good novels in his previous life by an author named \"Anonymous.\"\n\nThe story wasn't very long, it seemed to be only the first part, looking like a serial.\n\nIt told the story of a good policeman who sacrificed himself to save hostages.\n\nAfter death, his soul returned for a special reason,\n\nRevived,\n\nAnd continued to fight criminals...\n\n\"So cliché, I've seen plenty of similar American movies.\"\n\nLawyer An finished reading the story and found it a bit boring,\n\nBut slowly,\n\nHe seemed to realize something,\n\nAnd froze.\n\n---\n¹ \"Er Feng Peng Zhu\" (二鳳捧珠) is a fictional dish, likely named to sound auspicious or grand. \"Er Feng\" can translate to \"two phoenixes,\" and \"Peng Zhu\" means \"holding a pearl.\"",

    "content": "The children left. At first, it was just one or two who started crying after seeing the situation in the intensive care unit, and then the other children joined in.\n\nEven though most of the children didn't know why they were crying, they cried along.\n\nAnyone seeing them would think Old Zhang had already ascended to heaven, and these children were there to mourn.\n\nOf course, no one disliked these children; after all, they were just children.\n\nZhou Ze and Old Zhang's son were smiling because they found the children adorable. Yes, they were truly adorable.\n\nIt was Old Zhang who had sacrificed his life to save them. Watching these innocent and naive children crying and fussing in front of them was a kind of enjoyment.\n\nThe young man suddenly felt his father's sacrifice was worthwhile. These delicate flowers truly needed adults to care for them.\n\nThe pain of losing his father and seeing how cute these children were, made him cry and laugh at the same time, his emotions very complex.\n\nThe children's parents could only come over to restrain their own children and then one by one came to express their condolences to the young man, offering blessings and slipping him their business cards.\n\nThe young man simply nodded, responding with \"It's what I should do.\"\n\nFor Old Zhang, being a police officer who sacrificed himself to protect people's lives and property was indeed \"what he should do.\" It was an honor and a glory belonging to a police family.\n\nAfter all these children and their parents left, the corridor outside the intensive care unit returned to its quiet state.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe young man shook his head.\n\n\"Oh, right, I haven't asked your name yet.\"\n\n\"Zhang Feng.\"\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\"My father called me not long ago and mentioned something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He said he'd put a notebook in the home safe and asked if I wanted to see it.\"\n\n\"Mmm?\"\n\n\"I said yes, I wanted to see it. I thought it should contain his case experiences and insights over the years, which would be a precious asset to me. But my father said I couldn't see it yet, and that I could if he were no longer around.\"\n\nZhou Ze showed a hint of surprise.\n\n\"I didn't think much of it at the time, because in the criminal investigation field, death isn't something to shy away from. My father often said such things.\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered mentioning the notebook to Zhang Yanfeng not too long ago. He had said that if Zhang Yanfeng were to die, he could leave behind a notebook, writing some things about the bookstore and himself, and then his son could become like the protagonist in a treasure hunt adventure drama, coming to find him with the notebook.\n\nCould that funny guy Zhang Yanfeng have actually done it?\n\nIsn't this like cursing himself to death?\n\nAnd if he died, why leave his son behind?\n\nTo have him look at the notebook and visit my bookstore late at night?\n\nThis isn't a nursery.\n\nZhou Ze decided that when Old Zhang completely breathed his last, he would have a good talk with his spirit. Boss Zhou didn't have the leisure time to take care of his son.\n\nBefore, you were already annoying me by constantly finding cases for me, and now after you die, I have to brainstorm and play nanny for your son after he graduates? I'm not some old man living in a ring, I don't have that kind of free time.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's phone rang. It was Lawyer An.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hello, where are you? I have something to tell you.\"\n\n\"I'm at the hospital.\"\n\n\"Okay, I figured you'd be at the hospital. Wait a moment, I'll come up after I park the car.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up and glanced at Zhang Feng, who was still squatting there. He didn't offer any more comfort and walked out directly.\n\nHe met Lawyer An at the elevator entrance. Lawyer An seemed to be in a hurry, as if something major had happened.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Take a look at this.\"\n\nSaying that, Lawyer An handed Zhou Ze the magazine *Prison Break* he was holding.\n\n\"Look at the last article, that story.\"\n\nZhou Ze flipped to the back and found the article. After a brief read, he immediately flipped back to the cover to confirm the magazine's publication location. Zhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\n\"You know that person too?\" Lawyer An asked, somewhat surprised.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and then said, \"But I don't know much.\"\n\n\"I don't know much either. He asked me to read this article, and then I instinctively connected it to the present.\" Lawyer An gestured towards the intensive care unit. \"The person imprisoned is the brother-in-law of the one lying here.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nLawyer An's eyes darted around. \"Then it seems there's a possibility?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, I don't know,\" Zhou Ze said hesitantly. \"Because he...\"\n\n\"Because he might have written his wife and children to death,\" Lawyer An finished his sentence.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. For such a person, Boss Zhou really didn't want to provoke him for the time being, as he didn't know the other party's background. However, the pen that was likely the Yin-Yang Pen was probably in that person's hands.\n\nHis trip to Changzhou had made Zhou Ze realize one thing: a big shot in hell might have noticed him. After all, in reality, he wasn't exactly keeping a low profile, and some information might have spread to hell, which was normal. But that sense of crisis had already emerged in Zhou Ze's heart. At this juncture, he really didn't want to get involved with the person in prison.\n\nHowever, according to the story's progression, the protagonist police officer, who was very similar to Zhang Yanfeng, had been reborn after death. What did this mean? Did the story write itself into reality, thereby changing reality?\n\n\"Take a closer look at the article. Although it doesn't explicitly state how Zhang Yanfeng was resurrected after death, it describes his soul wandering. Then, at a traffic light intersection with a pig's head meat shop, he saw a middle-aged drunkard who had died by the roadside from alcohol poisoning. He then possessed that body and was thus reborn. You don't need to read the rest; it's purely a Marvel superhero story template.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"If it's as written in the story, and if you truly want him to revive, you first need to ensure that at the traffic light intersection with the pig's head meat shop, late at night, a drunkard will appear. Look again, it mentions the date of death for the protagonist soul: July 30, 2018. Today is the 29th. This means that tonight, around midnight, Zhang Yanfeng might not make it and will die.\"\n\n\"That person, is he a Judge?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nLawyer An was analyzing the article for Zhou Ze and clarifying what needed to be done, but Zhou Ze suddenly asked this question, which left Lawyer An momentarily speechless. He scratched his head, unsure. \"He's not a Judge. Judges rarely operate in the mortal realm for so long. Those who usually run errands in the mortal realm are minor figures, even inspectors. They seldom come to the mortal realm unless there's a matter.\"\n\n\"Then what is he?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I only knew about this person two years ago. How I contacted him is a long story. If you want to know, I can tell you later. The most important thing now is, if the things in the story can truly be reflected in reality, what do we need to do?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned and said, \"First, let's find out where this intersection with the pig's head meat shop is. We'll confirm the location first.\"\n\n\"What about the dead drunkard?\" Lawyer An asked. \"How should that be arranged?\"\n\n\"If what the story writes is true, then a drunkard should appear at that time and happen to die there.\"\n\n\"I think the story's role in helping us solve the problem of handling and retaining the police spirit is the limit. A story is just a story; the development of reality is sometimes difficult to fully control by things written in words.\"\n\n\"Then you find a body and arrange it at that location when the time comes. I'll find an opportunity to go into the intensive care unit and talk to Old Zhang, telling him where his spirit needs to float after death.\"\n\n\"Mmm, that can work.\"\n\nFinding a body wasn't difficult for Lawyer An, as it was his old line of work. The bodies his clients possessed after coming up were also bodies he had arranged beforehand. In fact, it wasn't necessary to have a body that had just died and was still warm; as long as a suitable body was found, some formations and talismans could keep it fresh. In fact, why could Lawyer An arrange his clients into mental hospitals or prisons so easily? Was it all just coincidence?\n\nPerhaps Lawyer An was doing Batman-like work behind the scenes. After all, some people deserved to die, or were even fugitives. Of course, Lawyer An wouldn't actually kill anyone, but there were many ways to make someone die without him directly acting.\n\nAfter confirming their partnership, Lawyer An became quite dedicated to Zhou Ze's affairs. He sometimes even called Zhou Ze \"Boss\" like the little girl and Bai Yingying. Although he had no interest in saving the police spirit by swapping bodies, it didn't stop him from diligently completing the tasks Zhou Ze assigned him. In fact, although the bookstore had so many \"fish\" – oh, no, so many employees – there was practically no one else with professional abilities like Lawyer An.\n\nAround 8 PM, Lawyer An called, saying he had found the location. In Xingren Town, Tongzhou District, there was a very famous Cui Ji Pig's Head Meat shop, and right in front of the shop on the road was an intersection with traffic lights. Also, the body had been arranged. As for how he managed to arrange a usable body so quickly, Zhou Ze didn't ask in detail.\n\nBoss Zhou took the opportunity of a ward round to enter the intensive care unit and chatted with Old Zhang for a while. Old Zhang was not awake and had no consciousness, so Zhou Ze didn't know if he had heard anything. However, Zhang Feng, Old Zhang's son, was surprised by Zhou Ze talking to his unconscious father for so long about how delicious pig's head meat was. Having been a son for so many years, he hadn't realized his father had such a deep affection for pig's head meat?\n\nAt one o'clock in the morning, the date had already turned to July 30th. Zhou Ze stood outside the intensive care unit waiting. Zhang Feng, though very sleepy, hadn't slept. Suddenly, the monitoring equipment began to alarm. Doctors and nurses rushed in. After the patient's condition became critical and resuscitation was unsuccessful, Old Zhang finally \"passed on gloriously.\"\n\nZhang Feng looked somewhat dejected, leaning against the wall with vacant eyes, tears flowing again. Then, he looked to the side and saw Zhou Ze, dressed in a white coat, clench his fist and wave it, excitedly shouting, \"Yes!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhang Feng.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood outside the intensive care unit, waiting for Old Zhang's soul to appear. If he had gotten more elaborate, he could have presented flowers and a microphone, asking Old Zhang to share his feelings after his glorious departure.\n\nUnfortunately, the number of people in this world who can see spirits is truly scarce, not enough to form a crowd. Otherwise, they could really invite Old Zhang to hold a speaking tour of exemplary deeds or something.\n\nHowever, suddenly, a gust of wind blew. The lights in the hallway flickered collectively. Ordinary people might not think much of it, perhaps a temporary voltage issue, which is normal. But Boss Zhou's body trembled violently. He immediately pushed open the door to the ICU and rushed in. Yet, a shadow had moved faster than Boss Zhou, soaring directly over the hospital bed and then flying out the window. Old Zhang's body lay there quietly, his soul, gone!\n\nWhy was this different from the plot in the story? Didn't the story say Old Zhang floated away on his own? Then what was that shadow that just appeared?\n\nPerhaps it was because Lawyer An was overly concerned and desperately wanted to assert his presence, after all, he was a newly recruited subordinate, and there was certainly a strong desire to perform. Therefore, he hadn't relayed the key point the person from the prison had warned about. This was likely not intentional omission, but perhaps he himself had overlooked it, that one sentence: \"Don't do anything.\"\n\nThat sentence had another meaning: if you stir up trouble, trouble will stir you up instead.\n\nBoss Zhou burst out of the hospital building like a madman, scanning the parking lot repeatedly, but not a ghost in sight. His fingernails grew rapidly, and then Zhou Ze plunged them into the ground. Black mist began to diffuse from his fingertips, extending northward.\n\nThere! Zhou Ze ran in that direction. Since the black mist could indicate the direction, it meant that thing was not far from him.\n\nOutside the hospital was a street. After Zhou Ze crossed this street, there was a green belt garden outside a residential area. By the time Zhou Ze reached here, he was already panting heavily.\n\n\"Coo coo... coo coo...\" Birdsong? Zhou Ze looked up. On a tree diagonally in front of him, he saw an owl standing on a branch, its eyes looking at him. And at the owl's tail, it was wrapped with a gray sheen – that was a soul!\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze spotted the owl, the owl also spotted Zhou Ze and flapped its wings, taking off. If it flew away, it would truly be a case of \"the sky is high and the birds are free.\" Unless Boss Zhou transformed into Ultraman, what else could he do but chase! Moreover, Zhou Ze could see that Old Zhang's soul was constantly weakening. In about half an hour, Old Zhang would completely vanish.\n\nZhou Ze could also keep Old Zhang's soul, but unless Old Zhang was someone with deep grievances and obsessions, if he was destined to go to hell upon death, and Zhou Ze forcibly kept him, then Old Zhang's soul would continuously diminish, just like Zhou Ze when he first returned from hell. This was the biggest knot Zhou Ze had faced. He had initially thought he could solve it with that pen, but now there was a hitch.\n\n\"Come back... for me!\" Zhou Ze instinctively reached out his hand. Ten black mist tendrils swiftly extended from his fingertips, instantly encircling the owl. Zhou Ze clapped his hands together, and the black mist also enveloped the owl. The owl trembled, and then fell headfirst to the ground. Zhou Ze immediately rushed over, but then, black smoke suddenly emanated from the owl. The owl's body instantly turned into dry bones, even its feathers becoming tattered.\n\nThe black smoke diffused into an image resembling a monkey, but definitely not a monkey. It was another creature with a face like that of the Thunder God. Zhou Ze forgot the proper name for this thing, but he remembered seeing a similar description when he was idly flipping through the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* in the bookstore. This was a being that was neither fully demon nor fully ghost, with three tails, sharp claws, and fish scales. It was said to originate from the Netherworld Sea.\n\nOf course, this was a minor entity, and its mention in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* was brief, as it was indeed unremarkable. Xu Qinglang had also helped Zhou Ze select many books, mostly ghost stories. A scholar in the Southern Song Dynasty wrote a book called *Water Pond Ghost Tales*, which specifically recorded this creature. He named it \"Ghost Falcon,\" though this was more of a nickname.\n\nThe book roughly introduced this creature, stating that they liked to operate in areas with desolate graves, enjoying consuming souls and the vital energy of humans. During times of turmoil, the numbers of these creatures would surge, but once peace returned, they would gradually disappear or become scarce.\n\nAnd now, Boss Zhou felt he had struck it lucky, or perhaps the unfortunate Old Zhang had won the lottery, being targeted and having his soul intercepted by a wandering Ghost Falcon. The probability was like encountering a South China tiger while picnicking in the mountains. Fortunately, Boss Zhou persistently chased after it, not giving the Ghost Falcon a chance to feed. Old Zhang's soul was still entangled with the Ghost Falcon's tail. If Zhou Ze had been a little slower, Old Zhang's soul might have already become a snack and been devoured.\n\n\"Good boy, release its soul, or you're dead today.\" Zhou Ze didn't know if it could understand human language, but he had to try. In fact, despite the Ghost Falcon's cunning and some special supernatural abilities, they were all rather insignificant. Otherwise, its presence in fictional works wouldn't be so low.\n\nThe Ghost Falcon stared at Zhou Ze coldly, but it was clear its ferocity was feigned. Obviously, it also knew that Zhou Ze was not something it could handle.\n\n\"Release him, and you can go!\" Zhou Ze said. It wasn't that Zhou Ze was willing to babble, but because the Ghost Falcon had seized Old Zhang's soul, it was like a robber holding a hostage. This was completely different from Zhou Ze's situation in Changzhou a few days ago. The fat monk who was held hostage could be killed if he wanted, why would he threaten me?\n\nHowever, at this moment, Zhou Ze had to ensure the safety of Old Zhang's soul. Otherwise, all his efforts would have been in vain?\n\nThe Ghost Falcon's eyes darted around, as if contemplating. Its expression also began to relax, revealing fear and apprehension.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze suddenly thought of something. In the hospital, he hadn't used Lawyer An's method to conceal his presence because he was a Death Messenger and could sometimes be more unrestrained. This meant that the Ghost Falcon, after sensing his presence, still chose to snatch food from a tiger's mouth!\n\nAt this moment, the fear and apprehension displayed in its eyes were feigned!\n\n\"Do you have a way?\" Zhou Ze said in his mind. He was asking the one inside his body. Although the situation was a bit strange now, and Boss Zhou hadn't encountered a real crisis, he hoped to rescue Old Zhang's soul completely as soon as possible. Therefore, he could only seek help from the one inside him.\n\nHowever, this time, the one inside him gave no response at all, as if completely dead silent. In the past, when Zhou Ze called it, it wouldn't converse or communicate, but it would give a slight tremor, like a muffled \"mmm\" from its throat while asleep, a perfunctory response to Boss Zhou. But this time, there was no response whatsoever.\n\nWhat was going on? The clearly unusual Ghost Falcon, combined with the sudden loss of contact, gave Zhou Ze a bad premonition. It felt as if someone had set a trap for him, and he had walked right into it. Coincidentally, Old Zhang's soul had also become entangled in this trap.\n\n\"Whoosh... whoosh... whoosh...\" Wind blew, rustling the surrounding flower beds and greenery. At the same time, small white flowers began to grow on the existing vegetation at a visible speed, emitting a faint mist. This was somewhat similar to the ordinary people's inability to notice or observe the barrier formed by the black mist emanating from both parties when Zhou Ze fought the demon monkey before.\n\n\"Flowers bloom on two paths, souls return to the Yellow Springs;\nAlas, alas, no past connection.\"\nSomeone was softly chanting. Within the mist, the illusion of a bridge appeared. One end of the bridge had two stone tablets, inscribed with \"Past Life.\" On the bridge, there was an archway, inscribed with \"Helpless.\"\n\nThe Bridge of Helplessness!\n\n...\n\nIn the prison library, the lights were still on. Even at this hour, a prisoner in prison attire sat inside, writing something with a fountain pen. As a model student in prison, a publicity showpiece, and a benchmark for the prison administration's achievements, he naturally received this privilege. After all, creation was not assembly-line work; inspiration often struck at any time.\n\nHowever, his creative state seemed to be not very good today. As he wrote, he had to stop and take a sip of water. He was experiencing writer's block, and it was very uncomfortable. He scratched his head, then looked at the moonlight outside the window, frowning slightly, and stood by the window. Then, he walked back and picked up the fountain pen again. After thinking for a long time, he put it down.\n\nThe originally planned story could not be written, as if a hand had unexpectedly reached out and disrupted everything in the story. He bit the tip of the pen, and finally had to put the pen down again, gulping down several mouthfuls of water. A hint of panic finally appeared on his normally calm face, which usually bore a faint smile.\n\n\"Ahhhhhh!!!!\" He frantically reached out and tore apart the paper with some writing on it. He sat in his chair, his chest heaving violently. \"It's ruined, it's ruined, the story is ruined...\" He tilted his head back, unwilling but helpless. \"Brother-in-law, I can't save you anymore...\"\n\nThen, he frantically began to bang his forehead against the desk, crying out: \"Just like I couldn't save her and the children back then!!!\"",

    "title": "Chapter 339: The Comedy of the Bridge",
    "content": "The Bridge of Helplessness, rumored to connect the past lives and rebirths of living beings, had now appeared before Zhou Ze as an illusion.\n\nGhost Falcon prostrated itself before the bridge, trembling with a fawning expression. It seemed to already know that this Bridge of Helplessness would appear here.\n\nZhou Ze silently observed all of this. Clearly, the Bridge of Helplessness before him originated from Hell and was even connected to eyes from Hell.\n\nBecause of this, the consciousness within his body began to play dead, afraid to reveal its aura lest it be discovered by the big shots from Hell.\n\nThis was the only possible explanation.\n\n\"Crack... crack...\"\n\nA cracking sound echoed. At the bridge pier, a dazzling crack appeared, and then the crack spread upwards, gradually covering the entire bridge. At this moment, the illusion of the Bridge of Helplessness was like a delicate porcelain vase on the verge of collapse.\n\nGhost Falcon continued to kowtow. If it had a physical form, it would surely have bloodied its forehead to show its sincerity.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nA crisp shattering sound rang out. The illusion of the Bridge of Helplessness turned into fragments and began to scatter, along with the white mist that had surrounded them. Everything came and went in a hurry, and the surroundings returned to silence as if nothing had happened.\n\nBut Zhou Ze did not believe that what he had just seen was an illusion. Although the Bridge of Helplessness had disappeared, Ghost Falcon remained prostrate, continuing to kowtow, and its demeanor was even more respectful than before.\n\n\"Hiss hiss hiss... hiss hiss hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly noticed a bulge in the muddy ground of the flowerbed in front of him, as if something was pushing outwards from within, forming a small bump that continued to exert force. Ghost Falcon continued to kneel before this raised mound of earth, its three tails wagging ceaselessly. Each tail was wrapped around a soul.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nClumps of mud fell away, and a hand emerged. It was a skinny, mud-covered hand. This hand slowly pressed down on the ground and then slammed down!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe ground seemed to tremble a few times, and the surrounding soil splattered outwards, rising in scorching white smoke. When the white smoke dissipated, a woman's figure was revealed in its place.\n\nThe woman's legs were crossed, and she seemed to be struggling to maintain her balance. She wore a tattered and filthy short skirt and a black short-sleeved shirt. She was barefoot, and her hair was matted and hardened. What was most striking were her eyes; within the sunken eye sockets, a strange emerald green flowed.\n\nIt was difficult to describe this woman as beautiful or not, because she was practically a half-dried corpse. It was obvious that this body had been buried underground for some time.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\nA tremor suddenly ran through him.\n\nHuh?\n\nFinally responding to me?\n\nThe Bridge of Helplessness had disappeared, and the connection between Hell and the mortal realm here had ended. Therefore, the consciousness within him had finally acknowledged him.\n\nZhou Ze wished he could give it the middle finger right now. Usually, it acted like an invincible, arrogant being that could conquer everything, always boasting about Emperor Huang Di and the Underworld Sea from back in the day. But just now, it was utterly cowardly, perhaps to avoid revealing its identity.\n\nThirty years east, thirty years west. Lord Taishan and that moving mountain ape were once powerful figures in Hell, but now they were long gone. The one within him had likely also encountered some misfortune to be in its current state. Sometimes, one had to be humble, hide in dark corners, and lick their wounds.\n\nThe phantom of the Bridge of Helplessness just now was more like a passageway. At least for that moment, it had connected Hell and the mortal realm, as if a soul had been sent out from Hell and had merged into this female corpse underground.\n\nIt was quite an elaborate and official affair. Zhou Ze remembered that when he had stumbled out of Hell in a daze, he hadn't received such treatment.\n\nNow, Boss Zhou wondered if he should quickly call Old Zhang. Someone was buried under the flowerbed of this residential area; there must have been a murder. But then he remembered that Old Zhang had already achieved glory, his soul was still lingering on the tail of that Ghost Falcon, so calling him would be pointless.\n\n\"Are you... a local... ghost messenger?\"\n\nThe woman pointed at Zhou Ze and asked. Her tone carried the domineering air of a superior, as if she didn't even regard Zhou Ze as a threat.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"I am from the Bridge of Helplessness. On the orders of the Bridge of Helplessness, I have appeared in the mortal realm to investigate a matter.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the woman drew a stroke in front of her, and a rune appeared, flying towards Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze looked at the rune intently, nodding from time to time and emitting sounds of \"Mm.\"\n\nAlright, the truth was, Boss Zhou couldn't understand this thing at all. If the little萝莉 were here, she would probably understand it, as she was formally trained, while Boss Zhou was an insert student with connections through the back door. There was indeed a significant gap in their foundational knowledge. But it was unlikely that the fake certificate business had become so powerful as to open branch offices from the mortal realm to Hell. Plus, she presented it to him so openly; it was probably real, right?\n\nThe rune disappeared, and the woman's body trembled slightly. She glanced displeasedly at her filthy body, then reached behind her back.\n\n\"Plop!\"\n\nSomething was pulled out. When she brought it forward, it was a rusty pair of scissors with bloodstains on them.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nThe scissors were casually tossed to the ground. This was likely the murder weapon, the murder weapon of the owner of this corpse? The woman then bent down and began to retch repeatedly. A dark mass was vomited out, presumably the remaining contents of her stomach. These things emitted a stench unimaginable to normal people. Zhou Ze knew that undigested food remaining in the stomach after death was often a favorite of forensic pathologists, who considered it the most beautiful gift from nature. Forensic pathologists could use this to infer the time of death and other useful information.\n\nAfter vomiting, the woman's lower body was still trembling. She glared angrily at her own body and then looked up at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"This body is really not good.\"\n\nSaying that, the woman extended her hand. Ghost Falcon immediately threw one of the souls from its tail towards her. The woman caught it and then tilted her head back, swallowing it. She then let out a long sigh, as if she felt much better. Her formerly shriveled body seemed to become fuller, and a hint of vitality appeared on her face.\n\nSwallowing souls to replenish oneself was something Zhou Ze had seen many times. The official soul from the Wen Temple had done the same thing, and the consciousness within him would devour the souls of its opponents whenever it had the chance. Fortunately, this was not Old Zhang's soul. Ghost Falcon's three tails were each wrapped around three different souls.\n\nNext, Ghost Falcon took another soul and prepared to throw it to the woman. This was Old Zhang's soul!\n\n\"This is my friend.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the soul in Ghost Falcon's hand.\n\nThe woman's eyes narrowed. \"Your friend's soul?\"\n\nGhost Falcon hesitated. It didn't know if it should continue handing the soul to the woman. It seemed as if the woman might be willing to compromise for Zhou Ze's sake. After all, from the perspective of a low-level undead creature like Ghost Falcon, both Zhou Ze and the woman before her were officials from the same administration, beings it could not afford to offend.\n\nHowever, the woman's next words were exceptionally presumptuous and arrogant: \"Since it's your friend's, it should be even tastier!\"\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply. As Ghost Falcon threw the soul, the black mist on Zhou Ze's fingers instantly erupted, intercepting Old Zhang's soul midway and drawing it to his side. Old Zhang's soul was already very weak and continued to weaken. If it was delayed further, not only would Old Zhang be unable to reincarnate, but he might completely dissipate. Zhou Ze intended to save him, and he did not wish for the outcome to be this.\n\nThe woman glared coldly at Zhou Ze. \"You dare to defy the will of the Bridge of Helplessness?\"\n\n\"I am a ghost messenger of the Underworld, not someone from the Bridge of Helplessness. You showed me that rune to indicate your identity, but you have no right to command me.\"\n\nZhou Ze said sternly. Yes, if the Underworld were compared to an ancient imperial court, then places like the Bridge of Helplessness were akin to ancient feudal lords or feudal kings with enfeoffed territories. The Underworld nominally had leadership authority over these places, but they each possessed their own spheres of influence. These were things that the little萝莉 had told Zhou Ze. Therefore, as an official appointed by the court, Zhou Ze indeed did not have to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Bridge of Helplessness. However, ordinary ghost messengers, when facing beings from the Bridge of Helplessness, would likely rush to grovel, regardless of whether it was in accordance with regulations or procedures.\n\n\"You... very good.\"\n\nThe woman pointed at Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze was ready to retaliate at any moment, but the woman did not attack him. Instead, she chose to walk towards Ghost Falcon. She seemed to have some reservations, or perhaps she needed Zhou Ze's assistance to complete her mission, and therefore did not choose to openly clash with him.\n\nGhost Falcon handed over the third soul. The woman took the soul and swallowed it. Instantly, her face showed an expression of enjoyment, and her body began to plump up. Her former desiccated corpse-like appearance was gone. Ghost Falcon looked at the woman with a fawning expression, like a puppy waiting for its master's praise.\n\nHowever, the woman suddenly reached out and grabbed Ghost Falcon, lifting it directly. She opened her mouth and forcibly stuffed the struggling Ghost Falcon into her small mouth, making chewing motions before swallowing it with a sigh. Instantly, the woman's skin began to regain its moisture, elasticity, and luster. Even her lips took on a tempting red hue, making her indistinguishable from a living person.\n\n\"Hmph... I told you to prepare three souls for me to enjoy in advance; since one is missing now, I can only make up for it with you.\"\n\nThe woman said with a smile, inserting her little finger into her teeth and making a gesture of picking her teeth. Then, \"Burp...\" She let out a loud burp.",

    "content": "Lawyer An's car was parked on the road by the intersection. He himself was sitting on the trunk, a cigarette between his fingers. It was late, and apart from the occasional passing car, the road was mostly quiet.\n\nLet alone Old Zhang's restless spirit, Lawyer An hadn't even seen a stray cat.\n\nShaking the ash from his cigarette, Lawyer An picked up his phone again and dialed Zhou Ze. He had tried several times before, but it kept saying he was out of service area.\n\nThis time, the call finally connected. Not far away, a phone ring also echoed.\n\nLawyer An looked up. First, he saw Zhou Ze. Before he could complain about how slow Zhou Ze was, he saw the woman behind Zhou Ze, and his expression immediately darkened.\n\nZhou Ze and the woman walked over. Zhou Ze remained silent, but the woman spoke first:\n\n\"If you're going to do it, do it quickly. Don't waste time.\"\n\nLawyer An looked at Zhou Ze with some confusion.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating it was inconvenient to explain now.\n\nLawyer An glanced at the woman again, jumped off the trunk, and opened it. Inside lay the body of a middle-aged man.\n\n\"Runes from the Jiangshi sect.\"\n\nThe woman glanced at the corpse below, a smile appearing at the corner of her lips.\n\nFresh corpses are inconvenient to store. Even pure freezing isn't the best method. The Jiangshi sect, frankly speaking, is fundamentally the same as those who transport fruits and seafood.\n\nIf you transport spoiled seafood or rotten fruit, who will buy it?\n\nTherefore, the Jiangshi sect has its own methods for preserving corpses.\n\nAs for those with higher skill, they use secret techniques to ensure the corpse remains in a state that can be driven and commanded at any time.\n\nNaturally, this is a state where it can be possessed by a ghost at any time. Lawyer An, having been in this line of work for many years, naturally understood all the ins and outs and pathways.\n\nZhou Ze took out Old Zhang's soul.\n\nThe woman behind him licked her lips, appearing quite greedy. Even though she had already eaten three, she was still not full.\n\nNext,\n\nZhou Ze used his fingernails to control Old Zhang's soul and push it into the corpse.\n\nOld Zhang's soul clearly showed a reaction of rejection. It couldn't merge into the body at all. It had been a long time since Old Zhang died and his soul left his body. If this continued, either Zhou Ze would let him go to hell, or his soul would be scattered.\n\nZhou Ze hardened his heart and, with a forceful push, shoved the soul in. However, even though the soul entered, it was still darting around inside. Once Zhou Ze's suppression was gone, it could escape at any moment.\n\n\"Your fingernails are quite interesting.\"\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze's fingernails, a playful expression on her face.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the woman and looked at Lawyer An, asking:\n\n\"What do we do?\"\n\nThe merging was unsuccessful. Reincarnation into a borrowed corpse failed. What now?\n\nLawyer An was taken aback.\n\n*I know what to do?*\n\n*Doesn't the story say he'll drift over on his own to enter the body and be reincarnated into a borrowed corpse and revive?*\n\n*Now you've brought his restless spirit here. The pace of the script is completely off.*\n\nMoreover, Lawyer An had previously dealt with malevolent spirits who had been tortured and refined in hell. Their soul strength and quality were not comparable to these ordinary souls who had just died.\n\nIf every ordinary soul could achieve reincarnation into a borrowed corpse and return to life, wouldn't this world have been in chaos long ago?\n\n\"So verbose.\"\n\nThe woman reached out,\n\nShe formed a mudra on the corpse's chest.\n\nA scarlet imprint instantly fell, striking the chest area.\n\nThe soul, which had been darting around, finally stabilized, as if asleep.\n\n\"Where's the ghost messenger's token?\"\n\nThe woman asked.\n\n\"Hmm?\" Zhou Ze was momentarily stunned.\n\n\"His soul is too weak. He needs the ghost messenger's token to suppress it. Don't tell me you planned to smuggle him in and swap him out without even preparing a ghost messenger's token. That would be impossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, we have it.\"\n\nLawyer An took out a ghost messenger's token. Zhou Ze had given it to him earlier that day.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nLawyer An used his index finger to touch the center of the corpse's forehead and extracted a drop of black blood. This was soul blood, not corpse blood. However, this black blood looked particularly loose, indicating that the soul within the body was currently very weak.\n\nAfter dripping the blood onto the ghost messenger's token, Lawyer An placed the token into the corpse's hand to hold. He took a few steps back and nodded at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"If her sealing works, after some time, he might be able to wake up on his own.\"\n\n\"Alright, you drive the car back and take him with you. There aren't many rooms on the second floor of the bookstore. You'll be sharing a room with him for the time being, and you can be responsible for taking care of him,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"...\" Lawyer An.\n\n\"Can we leave now?\" the woman asked.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Lawyer An asked.\n\n\"To help her with something. She's from the Bridge of Helplessness.\"\n\n\"No need for introductions. I know who you are,\" the woman said, looking at Lawyer An. \"We on the Bridge of Helplessness have had dealings with him before. Am I right?\"\n\nLawyer An fell silent. His identity was somewhat awkward. It was actually unsuitable for him to meet official figures, even his former clients.\n\nHe also understood that in the eyes of his clients from the underworld, he was not someone to be trifled with. In reality, he was just a scoundrel in the mortal world, not yet respectable.\n\n\"Then be careful yourself,\" Lawyer An warned Zhou Ze, then got into his car and drove away.\n\nAfter driving off, Lawyer An deliberately looked at the scene of Zhou Ze and the woman standing together in the rearview mirror.\n\n\"Can we leave now?\"\n\nThe woman asked again.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took out his phone, and called for a ride-sharing car.\n\nEven though it was so late, after sending a red packet, someone accepted the order. More than ten minutes later, a black sedan stopped at the intersection.\n\nZhou Ze and the woman walked towards it together.\n\n\"What? Going to Tongcheng Prison? Are you guys out of your minds? Going to a place like that so late at night? No, no, I'm not taking this job. Cancel it. Who am I supposed to pick up from there?\"\n\nThe driver seemed to have just noticed the destination and, surprised, prepared to abandon the job.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe woman's hand directly landed on the driver's face.\n\nThe driver froze for a moment,\n\nThen he softly fainted.\n\nThe woman opened the car door and dragged the driver out. The driver lying on the roadside still had a look of enjoyment on his face, as if he were having a beautiful dream, extremely entranced.\n\n\"Can you drive?\" the woman asked Zhou Ze. \"If you can drive, you drive.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the woman sat in the passenger seat.\n\nZhou Ze also got in and started the car.\n\nFor a long time, there was no conversation between the two in the car, and it was very quiet.\n\nFinally, the woman spoke first, asking: \"Aren't you afraid of me at all?\"\n\n\"I am, very afraid.\"\n\nThe woman frowned. \"If I report what you did before, or leak it to those above, you'll be in a lot of trouble. This is a forbidden act, disrupting the order established by the Yin Division.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's why I'm very afraid.\"\n\n\"However, you can rest assured. If the water is too clear, there will be no fish. In fact, the Yin Division doesn't care much about low-level ghost messengers like you. You are just consumables. As long as someone is willing to risk their lives for merit points, that's the best outcome.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's why I'm very afraid.\"\n\n\"Is he really in there? Living in the prison?\"\n\n\"We made an agreement. You help me help my friend with reincarnation into a borrowed corpse, and I'll help you find that pen you want. I won't break my promise.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't break your promise. However, it's also too good a coincidence. It's so good it's like a script arranged by a story.\n\nI thought I would have to spend a long time finding him when I came up this time. But I ran into you directly, and you even know about his existence and the unknown.\n\nIt's really,\n\nA bit too smooth.\"\n\n\"Isn't smooth good?\" Zhou Ze glanced at the woman and lit a cigarette at the same time.\n\n\"Of course, smooth is good. If it's truly smooth.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the woman fell silent, and an eerie silence fell again in the car.\n\nThe woman would occasionally glance at Zhou Ze's steering wheel.\n\nTo be precise,\n\nShe was looking at Zhou Ze's fingers.\n\nMany ghost messengers, and even some beings from the underworld, have their own special abilities. But the woman felt these fingernails were somewhat unusual.\n\nThe car finally arrived outside the prison, and Zhou Ze parked.\n\n\"According to regulations, you need to make an appointment for a visit during the day to get in,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"I am from the underworld. I don't need to follow mortal rules.\"\n\nThe woman pushed open the car door, got out, and walked forward, disappearing into the darkness ahead.\n\nShe left with such freedom and decisiveness, almost lightly, as if she could leap.\n\nCompleting a mission as quickly as possible and reporting back was a glorious thing.\n\nAlthough the Bridge of Helplessness didn't have ghost messenger tokens, they were essentially the same. Everyone needed to do things to demonstrate their value and gain recognition.\n\nZhou Ze extended his hand out the window,\n\nFlicked the ash,\n\nHe felt that the events of tonight\n\nhad been too smooth.\n\nThe appearance of that ghost hawk,\n\nthe appearance of this woman,\n\nOld Zhang's soul was successfully sent into a body,\n\nThe woman said she was looking for a pen,\n\nZhou Ze said he knew,\n\nThe woman, in exchange for helping Zhou Ze's friend with reincarnation into a borrowed corpse, asked Zhou Ze to take her to find that pen.\n\nTruly,\n\nexcessively smooth,\n\nand,\n\nexcessively coincidental.\n\nBy now,\n\nthe woman's figure could no longer be seen.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring,\n\npulled down the sunshade, and opened the mirror inside.\n\nIn the mirror,\n\nwas also Zhou Ze.\n\n\"She went. Will she be able to come back?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nThe Zhou Ze in the mirror remained motionless, with no special reaction.\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nHe kept one hand on the car window,\n\nthrew the cigarette butt on the ground,\n\nyawned,\n\n\"If she can come out, I can't let her go down again, can I?\n\nShe's from the underworld and doesn't need to follow mortal rules;\n\nSo, since I'm in the mortal world, I don't need to follow underworld rules either.\"",

    "content": "It was past four in the morning, nearing the bookstore's closing time. The little loli sat behind the counter, idly flipping through a comic book.\n\nBusiness was dismal. After sitting around all night, she hadn't seen a single wandering soul. She had initially thought she might sneak in some extra earnings while Zhou Ze was back late tonight, but it seemed like a wasted effort.\n\nThe old Daoist had already taken Monkey upstairs to rest. Deadpool, after cleaning up, had also returned to his room. Bai Yingying, however, remained on the sofa, playing a mobile game and glancing at the door from time to time.\n\nIt was this late, and the boss still hadn't returned. Yingying was a little worried.\n\n\"Hey, silly zombie, let's go upstairs and sleep!\"\n\nThe little loli called out to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying shook her head, resolutely stating, \"The boss isn't back yet, so I'm not sleeping.\"\n\nThe little loli shook her head in distress. \"He's not back, but I want to sleep.\"\n\n\"I only sleep for the boss.\"\n\nThe little loli raised her hands in surrender. \"Okay, okay, I concede. This loli can only sleep with you.\"\n\nJumping down from her seat, the little loli stretched. It was then that she noticed something pasted on the glass door. She leaned closer and saw it was a large poster with a QR code and a man holding his phone with a surprised expression:\n\n\"Professional financial management, stable and secure, with generous interest rates. If you want to manage your finances, choose the 'Ji Gong Bao' Financial Management App!\"\n\n\"Hey, who put this up?\" the little loli asked Bai Yingying.\n\n\"The old Daoist put it up. He said someone came to promote it during the day and gave us three thousand yuan as a promotional fee to have this poster displayed at our door for a month. The money has already been put into the public account,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"'Ji Gong Bao' Financial Management App?\" The little loli smacked her lips. \"Nowadays, all sorts of 'Bao' are coming out. Qian Bao, Wa Bao, and now Ji Gong Bao. I'm getting a bit hungry. Oh, right, let's ask Old Xu to make some 'Ji Gong Bao' stew tomorrow.\"\n\nBai Yingying rolled her eyes.\n\n\"We should tear this poster down. Posting this kind of thing lowers our class,\" the little loli said, reaching out and tearing the poster off.\n\n\"Someone is coming to inspect tomorrow. If you tear it down, we'll have to refund him tomorrow,\" Bai Yingying reminded her.\n\n\"So what if we refund him? Anyway, the boss is already so poor, another bit of poverty won't make much of a difference.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say.\"\n\nTruth be told, Bai Yingying didn't really care about that three thousand yuan.\n\nThe entire bookstore had a strange structure. The employees were all richer than the next, while the poorest was the boss.\n\n\"Swish!\"\n\nThe poster was torn down by the little loli.\n\nShe crumpled it into a ball.\n\n\"I really miss the days when I used to do business,\"\n\n\"You used to do this before?\" Bai Yingying asked, somewhat curiously.\n\n\"Silly zombie, I used to be a business tycoon! What kind of business tactics haven't I seen? This, actually, is quite a low-level trick.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\nBai Yingying became interested.\n\nShe had money,\n\nShe had a lot of money.\n\nBut her biggest problem now was that besides buying property, Bai Yingying didn't know how to manage her finances. Those burial objects were lifeless; frankly, she didn't have much affection for them. It would be better to turn them into money, and then let money generate more money.\n\nBecause the boss liked money,\n\nBai Yingying instinctively felt that money was a very good thing, even if she didn't eat or drink.\n\n\"I used to take good things and make them bad. I would turn a company with excellent performance, great potential, and strong development prospects into a company with piles of bad debts, a bleak outlook, and a parasitic nature if it wasn't reformed.\n\nBasically, it involved all sorts of public opinion manipulation and propaganda, along with some ambiguous claims, like collusion between officials and businesses.\"\n\n\"Tell me more.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't understand if I told you.\"\n\n\"Tell me, otherwise, don't expect me to sleep with you.\"\n\n\"…………\" The little loli.\n\n\"For example, it's like taking a diamond and promoting it as a stone from a latrine. The people who built the latrine would think it's trash and sell it to me for next to nothing, and they would still thank me.\n\nBut in reality, a diamond is a diamond. Once you wipe off the dirt, it's still a diamond. What I did most was buy diamonds at the price of stones. Many people played this game back then; it was a common tactic.\n\nAs for those truly trash state-owned enterprises, which idiot would buy them?\"\n\n\"Mmm...\" Bai Yingying nodded, half-understanding.\n\n\"This is high-level work because there's substance involved, and your operational methods must be very rich.\n\nBut this Ji Gong Bao is the lowest level of work because there's nothing behind it.\n\nThey'll brag to you, saying they've taken everyone's money to invest in some company, done some real business, invested in some sports teams, so they'll share dividends with everyone and offer interest rates several times higher than the bank's, assuring everyone to send them money.\"\n\n\"Mmm...\"\n\n\"It's basically a Ponzi scheme. Once there's a run on the bank, it's GG. Some people might have made money, but they only earned money from the last batch of people who took the bait.\"\n\n\"Isn't that foolish?\"\n\n\"There aren't many truly foolish people; most people are just pretending to be foolish.\"\n\nThe little loli stretched.\n\n\"The key is how you package it. For something that doesn't exist, something fake, if you promote it heavily and constantly 'write its biography,' it can become a real thing.\n\nWhether this person actually exists is irrelevant;\n\nAs long as everyone believes this person exists, that's enough.\n\nAs for whether this person truly exists,\n\nNo one really cares.\"\n\n\"That's a bit profound.\"\n\nBai Yingying propped her chin in her hand, contemplating.\n\n\"Alright, let's go to sleep,\" the little loli said. \"When Zhou Ze gets back, he can wash himself up and get into our bed.\"\n\n\"But I still want to wait for the boss to come back.\"\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath, realizing she had wasted her breath.\n\nHowever,\n\nAt that moment,\n\nA person walked past outside the bookstore. The person was wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase.\n\nAt first, the little loli thought it was that flashy lawyer returning because he was always dressed in a suit. But upon closer inspection, she realized something was off.\n\nHa!\n\nBusiness is here!\n\nThe door was pushed open by the person, who walked in confidently.\n\nAlright,\n\nShe had seen many wandering souls enter the bookstore, in all sorts of states, but this was the first time she had seen someone so radiant and full of confidence.\n\n\"I'll go prepare some food.\"\n\nBai Yingying stood up and went to prepare a few cold dishes. It was an innovative value-added service of the bookstore to entertain wandering souls before sending them on their way.\n\n\"You, come here!\"\n\nThe little loli pointed at the man in the suit, then pointed at a private room.\n\nThe man in the suit followed the little loli into the private room.\n\nBai Yingying came over with a few cold dishes and poured a cup of yellow wine.\n\nThe man in the suit ate and drank with gusto.\n\nAfter he finished eating, he could be sent on his way.\n\nThe little loli yawned.\n\n\"Do you want to get rich?\" the man suddenly lowered his head and looked at the little loli and Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Yes, yes. Leave more hell money when you go down, and we'll be satisfied,\" the little loli replied.\n\n\"No, no, no, what's hell money compared to that? I'll get you real gold and silver!\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nThe man opened his briefcase and took out a stack of documents.\n\n\"This is our company's business, professional financial management with extremely high profits. Our company has invested in many Fortune Global 500 companies, and it's guaranteed to make money!\"\n\nThe little loli almost burst out laughing.\n\nHow dedicated an employee could this be?\n\nEven after death,\n\nStill not forgetting to solicit business for his company. For that alone, the boss should give him more compensation.\n\nBai Yingying took the contract and began to read it. The little loli also leaned over to take a look and found that it was a promotional flyer for a financial management app, but it was much more exaggerated and dazzling than the Ji Gong Bao poster outside the door.\n\nThe annual interest rate outside was only in the teens, while this one was close to forty.\n\n\"Duck Bao?\" the little loli glanced at the platform's name and said, \"I just saw the news today, didn't they say this has already exploded due to a run? This platform is finished, the official website has crashed, and debt collectors are gathered at the Huanglong Stadium.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, how could that be? I am the Deputy Sales Manager of our Duck Bao. I have high confidence in our company's business strength and stability.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you let your parents invest? Why give it to outsiders?\" the little loli retorted.\n\n\"I did invest. My money, my parents' money, even the family's house was mortgaged and invested in it. My girlfriend's parents' money was also invested. Many relatives and friends were persuaded by me to invest.\"\n\nThe little loli was stunned.\n\nThis answer,\n\nShe didn't know how to respond.\n\n\"But this should be fake, right?\" Bai Yingying said, having been educated by the little loli earlier.\n\n\"It's real, it's definitely real. This run is just a temporary situation. If you buy in now, you'll definitely make a lot of money in the future!\n\nI'll guarantee it with my life!\"\n\n\"You don't have a life to guarantee anything with.\"\n\nThe little loli clapped her hands, urging, \"Alright, alright, stop the sales pitch. It's time to go, let's go.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nThe little loli stood up,\n\nOpened her mouth,\n\nAnd her inviting and energetic long tongue extended out.\n\n\"No, you have to listen to me, buy it, invest the money quickly, it's real, you'll definitely make money.\"\n\nThis salesman, before heading to the Yellow Springs Road, was still tirelessly promoting.\n\n\"We don't have money to buy it. Look, this bookstore isn't making money either. The boss has been operating at a loss,\" Bai Yingying spread her hands and said, \"Why are you so eager to tell us to buy?\"\n\nAre the words of a dying man benevolent?\n\nIt doesn't seem right.\n\n\"The Underworld has order... the Yellow Springs can be crossed...\"\n\nBeside them,\n\nThe little loli's exclusive background music began to play.\n\nThe Gates of Hell,\n\nOpen for you...\n\nThe man in the suit was sadly dragged inward. He couldn't struggle; at this point, he could only be passively pulled along, as struggling was useless.\n\nHe was somewhat sad, somewhat unwilling, and above all, extremely disappointed and bewildered.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nHe muttered to himself,\n\n\"If you don't invest, how can I get my parents' and my girlfriend's family's money out...\n\nSomeone has to...\n\nTake the bait...\"\n\n...\n\nPS: This chapter is a prelude to the main plot.",

    "content": "Lu Xun wrote in \"Collected Essays: Minor Random Thoughts\":\n\n\"Upon seeing short sleeves, I immediately think of bare arms, immediately think of the whole body, immediately think of reproductive organs, immediately think of sex, immediately think of promiscuity, immediately think of illegitimate children...\"\n\nZhou Ze was in a similar state at this moment.\nUpon seeing this prison,\nHe thought of Old Zhang's brother-in-law, then he thought of that pen, then he thought of the haunted villa bought by Yingying, followed by the bathroom, and then the mirror in the bathroom.\n\nAnd because of this,\nAs Zhou Ze looked at the mirror in the sun visor above him,\nIt was as if the person in the mirror,\nHe could communicate with himself,\nHe could make gestures at himself.\nBut in reality, everything was quiet, and the person in the mirror was still him.\n\nHe lit another cigarette and placed the hand holding it outside the car window.\nThat woman had been inside for nearly half an hour.\nJust as she had said,\nThose in hell would be very free if they didn't abide by the rules of the living world;\nBut everyone abided by the rules, the little loli also abided by them, and Zhou Ze also abided by them. No one told them what the specific consequences of not abiding by the rules would be.\nBecause,\nThose who did not abide by the rules all seemed to have died.\n\nHe flicked the ash,\nAs he was driving, that woman kept staring at his fingers. She must have noticed something.\nOrdinary ghost messengers, lonely souls, wouldn't have that knowledge. Even if they did, they wouldn't have a channel to report it.\nBut this woman was different. She said she was from the Bridge of Helplessness (Naihe Bridge).\n\nFurthermore,\nBoss Zhou seemed to have a slight impression,\nIt seemed he had killed an old maidservant from the Bridge of Helplessness.\nThe old woman who came to the bookstore to ask him about the red spider lily,\nIn the end, she couldn't go to hell and was torn to pieces by Boss Zhou.\n\nWithout realizing it,\nZhou Ze had grown accustomed to this way of dealing with matters. If he wanted to continue living a carefree life in the mortal world, he had to ensure that his affairs were not known to the real powers in hell. Therefore, any wandering souls that could expose his affairs were intercepted and killed by him. Most of them ended up in the belly of the consciousness within him.\nIt wasn't as extreme as \"better to kill a thousand by mistake than let one go,\"\nBut it was close.\n\nIn fact, many people in the bookstore felt that Zhou Ze's personality had changed slightly recently, but Zhou Ze himself might have been too close to the situation to notice.\nIn the entire bookstore, only the little loli could clearly perceive and confirm this, because she had personally witnessed that consciousness-state Zhou Ze pushing the corpse pill back and forth by her and Bai Yingying's mouths that night.\n\n\"I'm a little sleepy.\"\nZhou Ze yawned,\n\"I really want to sleep with Yingying.\"\n\n...\n\n\"You exist, deep in my mind, in my dreams, in my heart, in my songs...\"\nThe background music was still playing in the prison library. It was Qu Wanting's \"In My Songs.\"\nThe melody was melodious, not loud, faint, and low...\nThe man in prison clothes was still sitting there,\nAt his feet,\nWere crumpled pieces of paper all over the floor.\nThe fountain pen was placed on the table.\nThe story could no longer be written. It had escaped his control;\nAt this point, the author was no longer the author. Instead, he seemed to be a recipient of dictation. He was only responsible for writing down the words and recording the story. As for how this story would develop next, and how the characters would change,\nHe himself did not know.\nThe woman's figure appeared in the library. The prison's security system was very strict and complete, but it could only prevent prisoners from getting out, not wandering souls.\nShe entered and slowly walked up to the man.\nLooking at the man leaning back in his chair with his hands hanging down,\nShe first smiled, then withdrew her smile, revealing a look of suspicion:\n\"It's so smooth that it's hard for me to imagine. I've only been out for a few hours, and I've already seen what I wanted to find and the person I wanted to find.\"\nThis feeling,\nIt was like learning the day before Tang Sanzang was to embark on his journey to the West that the Spirit Mountain was right next to Chang'an.\nIt was unreal, too unreal, making one feel in a daze that all of this was fake.\nThe prisoner turned his head and looked at the woman beside him.\nAt the same time, in a corner of a prison cell, a prisoner was wrapped in a quilt, trembling as if sensing a familiar aura.\nBut fortunately,\nThat aura was not looking for him.\n\n\"Are you looking for this pen?\"\nThe prisoner pointed to the fountain pen on the table.\n\"And you.\"\nThe woman continued to approach,\n\"Actually, even more than this pen, the Bridge of Helplessness wants to know how you are able to wield this pen.\"\nThe prisoner looked at the approaching woman,\nShoulders slumped,\nWith a half-smile.\n\n\"This pen has been wandering in the mortal world for twelve cycles of sixty years. The Bridge of Helplessness never thought of looking for it, because when this pen was at the Bridge of Helplessness, even Meng Po didn't know what use it had besides drawing eyebrows. Everyone treated it as an exquisite piece of junk.\nBut now it's different. You can actually use it.\"\nSaying that,\nThe woman finally walked up to the prisoner,\nBent down, bent her knees,\nSquatted down,\nLooked up,\nAnd looked at the prisoner:\n\"I am taking the pen back, and I am taking you back. But to be honest, taking the life of a living person for no reason, especially in the mortal world, will cause a lot of trouble. I don't want to cause this trouble, nor do I want to give the Underworld an excuse to attack our Bridge of Helplessness because of this.\"\n\n\"Meaning, I won't die?\"\nDead people,\nAre the ones who can go to hell.\nThe woman nodded, \"Yes, you don't have to die. As long as you can explain how to use this pen, you won't die.\nIn return, the Bridge of Helplessness will allow you to remember some past lives when you cross the bridge next time, after your lifespan has ended, by making you drink half a bowl less of Meng Po's soup.\"\n\n\"That sounds pretty good.\" The prisoner pondered for a moment, then asked, \"What if I refuse?\"\n\n\"It will be a bit troublesome, but it's not impossible to take your soul down.\nPerhaps you don't know,\nThere is no such thing as ghost rights for wandering souls in hell.\nAt that time,\nYou'll find it hard not to speak.\"\n\nThe woman slowly stood up, reached out, and stroked the side of the prisoner's face.\nSensing the hardness of the stubble on his face.\nIn prison, of course, there were no conditions for shaving every day.\n\n\"I can't use this pen very well either,\" the prisoner said, pointing to the pen in front of him. \"I can't control it.\"\n\"Yes, because you are just an ordinary person,\" the woman said.\n\"Perhaps.\" The prisoner nodded.\nZhou Ze had speculated that this prisoner might be a judge.\nLawyer An had speculated that this prisoner was a very important figure.\nBut now the answer was out,\nHe,\nWas just an ordinary person.\nHell has ten halls of Yama, the Bridge of Helplessness, the Sea of the Underworld, Ksitigarbha, and countless terrifying demons that ordinary people would find horrific.\nBut the mortal world, from ancient times to the present, has always been the world of the living, the world of ordinary people.\nIt's not that the big figures in hell are well-behaved and content to mind their own business;\nIt's that the mortal world,\nIs also not that simple.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't tell you.\" The prisoner said apologetically, \"Because I don't even know how I can use it.\"\nThe woman looked at the prisoner.\nThe prisoner gave a wry smile, \"As you said, I am just an ordinary person. How could I know something that even you don't know?\"\nThe woman said nothing, just calmly said:\n\"Then I can only take your soul down.\"\nIn other words,\nYou have to die.\n\n\"When I go down, can I see my wife and children?\" the prisoner asked seriously.\nMany people had asked Boss Zhou similar questions,\nBecause scenes like \"I'll wait for you on the road to the Yellow Springs\" and \"Let's go to the Yellow Springs together\" often appear in various film and television works.\nWhether you are a high official, a wealthy businessman, or a recluse, everyone is curious about the unknown, especially what happens after they die.\nIt's just that,\nBoss Zhou could only give a very cold answer each time,\nBecause on the road to the Yellow Springs, wandering souls can only move forward numbly like walking dead, like puppets, or like components on an assembly line.\n\n\"That depends on your luck.\" The woman did not answer the question directly. She was too lazy to explain the situation in hell to the living. She reached out and placed her hand on the prisoner's forehead,\nPreparing to extract his soul.\nThe prisoner slowly closed his eyes,\nHe did not struggle,\nNor did he resist,\nAppearing,\nVery calm.\nHe knew it wasn't courage, but rather because he had nothing that he was fearless, much like the shoeless are not afraid of those with shoes.\n\n\"I'll ask you one last time, will you say yes or no...\"\n\"Hurry up, don't be so wordy.\"\nThe prisoner raised his hand and urged,\n\"The story is too wordy and too much nonsense. Readers will think you're dragging it out.\"\n\"...\" The woman.\n\"That's your own doing.\"\n\nA red rune appeared on the woman's palm.\nThe rune was sensing the soul within the prisoner, and thereby extracting it.\nFor a moment,\nThe space between the two was covered with a faint red glow, invisible to the naked eye, as if a layer of blood had been sprinkled on the ground.\nThe woman was calm at first.\nExtracting his soul,\nPicking up the pen,\nShe could return to the underworld to report.\nOf course,\nThere was also the ghost messenger who had brought her back,\nWho also needed to report to his superiors.\nIt wasn't that the ghost messenger's act of substituting flowers for wood was too taboo. In fact, for the major forces in hell, the law was only used to restrain the low-level wandering souls and ghost messengers, and it did not apply to themselves.\nWho didn't have their own little schemes behind the scenes?\nEven the Bridge of Helplessness had sought business from Lawyer An.\nWhat the woman wanted to report was the ghost messenger's fingernails. When those fingernails appeared, she had felt a tremor in her heart, which made her feel a hint of fear.\nA ghost messenger,\nMade her afraid.\nHeh heh.\nHowever, what the woman didn't know was that the ghost messenger who had brought her was still there. The car had been parked outside the prison, waiting to see if she could come out.\nIf she couldn't come out, it would be fine.\nIf she came out,\nWhether she could go down peacefully again,\nMight not be her decision.\nAlthough for Boss Zhou, every time he allowed that consciousness to awaken, his own safety was further compromised, but even drinking poison to quench thirst was better than his current carefree life being abruptly ended.\nVarious trivial matters aside for the moment,\nThe rune on the woman's palm had been flashing for a long time,\nBut nothing was extracted.\nA look of confusion appeared on the woman's face:\n\"You are not a living person!\"\nNo,\nThat's not right.\nEven if not a living person,\nThere should be no reason for a lack of soul, and this is in the mortal world!\nThen,\nThe woman seemed to realize something,\nAnd exclaimed in even greater terror:\n\"No, no, you simply don't exist!!!\"\n\"You exist, deep in my mind, in my dreams, in my heart, in my songs...\"\nThe background music in the library,\nContinued to slowly,\nPlay.\n\n— — —\n\nA new month has arrived.

    "title": "Chapter 343 Officer Zhang wakes up",
    "content": "After seeing off the \"Old Duck Pot\" business deputy manager, Jiu Kuang's mind and body were finally satisfied and nourished.\n\nThe little loli, content, was about to urge Bai Yingying to go to sleep.\n\nAt this time, it was almost dawn. Bai Yingying began to turn off the lights on the first floor, and then lawyer An's car stopped outside the bookstore.\n\n\"Is the boss back?\"\n\nBai Yingying hurried to open the door.\n\nBut only lawyer An got out of the car.\n\nThen, lawyer An walked to the trunk, opened it, and carried someone out.\n\n\"Is the boss injured? Huh, that's not right, why is the boss's belly so big.\"\n\nBai Yingying finally realized that lawyer An was not carrying the boss, but a middle-aged uncle with a large belly and a paunch.\n\n\"Give me a hand, beauty.\"\n\nLawyer An signaled Bai Yingying to help.\n\nBai Yingying shook her head, refusing.\n\nMen who are not the boss are all stinky; she didn't want to hold them.\n\nLawyer An was stunned for a moment and could only carry Old Zhang's body upstairs himself.\n\nThere are four rooms on the second floor of the bookstore. One is the master bedroom where Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying live, and the little loli also sleeps here.\n\nXu Qinglang lives alone in one room. The old Taoist priest, the little monkey, and Deadpool live in another room. The last vacant room, which was originally lawyer An's room, was also cleaned by Zhou Ze's order yesterday. However, starting today, Old Zhang will have to share a room with lawyer An.\n\nAfter placing Old Zhang on the bed, lawyer An checked Old Zhang's condition again. Some bodily functions were slowly recovering and waking up.\n\nIt was a bit like a machine that had been stopped, and after being charged, it slowly resumed operation.\n\nLawyer An looked at the seal on the person's chest for a while longer, his hands subconsciously gesturing, lost in thought.\n\nAs the only person in the bookstore who hasn't been \"salty\" and possesses strong professional abilities, lawyer An's ability to learn proactively is quite strong.\n\n\"Who is that?\" the little loli asked, walking into the room.\n\n\"That police officer.\" lawyer An replied.\n\n\"Didn't the news say he died tonight?\" the little loli was stunned for a moment, then realized, \"Did your trick of 'borrowing flowers to offer to Buddha'<sup>1</sup> succeed?\"\n\n\"So far, it's considered successful. We'll have to see when he actually wakes up.\"\n\nThe relationship between the soul and the body is a very unfathomable and complex one. Old Zhang's soul was forcibly inserted, and thus there might be a problem of hardware and software incompatibility. Whether it can actually run is hard to say.\n\n\"Where is the boss?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"He's busy with other things.\"\n\nAfter thinking about it, lawyer An decided not to mention the matter of that woman.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe little loli is not Bai Yingying and doesn't care about Zhou Ze in such a meticulous way.\n\n\"I'm going to take a shower. You keep an eye on him.\"\n\nLawyer An found a clean set of clothes from his luggage and went downstairs.\n\nThe little loli glanced at the uncle on the bed, thought for a moment, walked to the next room, pushed the door open, and saw Bai Yingying sitting on the bed reading a book.\n\nShe seemed unable to finish reading \"The Self-Cultivation of a Maid.\"\n\n\"Stupid zombie, there's a patient next door, can you go check on him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nBai Yingying refused outright.\n\nZombies are inherently cold-blooded. Except for Zhou Ze, Bai Yingying rarely shows enthusiasm towards others. Even towards others in the bookstore, Bai Yingying is just less indifferent.\n\nThe little loli hesitated for a moment, then went to the next door and knocked on Xu Qinglang's door and the old Taoist priest's door, shouting at the same time:\n\n\"That police officer has been brought back. You two watch him. I'm going to sleep.\"\n\nAfter saying that, without waiting for a response from the two rooms, the little loli quickly returned to the master bedroom, got into bed, and lay down next to Bai Yingying.\n\nShe yawned, feeling the comfortable and pleasant coldness emanating from her side, her eyelids began to feel heavy, and she quickly fell asleep.\n\nBai Yingying put down the book in her hand, watched the little loli, who had been sleeping normally just moments ago, now sprawled out in a starfish position. She pouted, picked up the book again, and didn't say anything.\n\nShe picked up her phone on the bedside table, thinking about whether to ask the boss when he would be back, but decided against it. When a man is socializing outside, if the woman at home always calls him to hurry home, it would make the man lose face in front of his friends.\n\nHowever, there are really so many people in the bookstore now.\n\nThere are foxes and monkeys, all sorts of people. The boss seems to have a collection habit, constantly filling his harem with all sorts of people.\n\nIt's truly… a cause for worry.\n\nBai Yingying seemed to have forgotten that she herself was the first collection obtained by Zhou Ze since he opened the bookstore.\n\nAs the little loli slept, she instinctively moved closer to Bai Yingying, hugging Bai Yingying's thighs with both hands, and her head burrowing towards Bai Yingying's crotch. She snuggled and mumbled, \"Mmm~ So delicious.\"\n\n\"...\n\n\"Creak!\"\n\nXu Qinglang and the old Taoist priest opened their doors almost simultaneously. Both looked a bit sleepy. They exchanged glances and asked together, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" The old Taoist priest glanced over and saw that the door to lawyer An's room was still open. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he walked over and peeked inside, seeing a strange middle-aged man lying on the bed.\n\n\"Huh?\" the old Taoist priest exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Little loli seemed to call him Officer Zhang just now,\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\n\"Oh.\" The old Taoist priest stretched, very sleepy, but forced himself to look extremely surprised. He raised both hands and waved them, exclaiming, \"So happy! Officer Zhang isn't dead!!!\"\n\nAfter shouting, the old Taoist priest yawned again. \"Still so sleepy.\"\n\nThey both walked in and watched Officer Zhang for a while.\n\nHonestly, there wasn't much to see. It wasn't like ordinary people going to the zoo to see animals. In this bookstore, you could see a zombie \"whining\" and serving tea and helping the boss bathe every day. You could see Deadpool eating bugs to ward off mosquitoes every day. You could see the little loli's seductive long tongue. Therefore, the two normal humans remaining in the bookstore (Old Xu and Old Dao) had their horizons and spiritual worlds greatly enriched. Old Zhang died, and then Old Zhang came back to life. Oh, it couldn't stimulate their nerves anymore. Of course, this was something to be happy about because Old Zhang was a good police officer, a good person. That alone was enough.\n\n\"I'm going to wash up. You watch him for a bit. His condition is a little unstable.\" Xu Qinglang said to the old Taoist priest.\n\n\"Okay.\" The old Taoist priest nodded and sat by the bed.\n\nXu Qinglang walked downstairs. He was still half-asleep and a bit groggy. When he opened the bathroom door, he saw lawyer An sitting inside, naked and lathering himself with body wash.\n\nLawyer An was startled. Xu Qinglang's eyelids flickered slightly, and then his gaze dropped straight down.\n\n\"Hey, get out!\"\n\nXu Qinglang shrugged and suddenly felt much more awake. He didn't go out but walked directly to the sink, picked up his toothbrush and toothpaste, and started brushing his teeth.\n\n\"Hey!\" Lawyer An was a little flustered.\n\nDamn it, are all the people in this bookstore this unrestrained!\n\n\"You wash yours. We all have dicks, what are you shy about?\" Xu Qinglang continued brushing his teeth.\n\nLawyer An frowned and suddenly felt that Xu Qinglang made a lot of sense. Since they were both men, what was he shy about? Thinking about it again, lawyer An knew the reason.\n\nDamn it, who told you this man looked like a woman!\n\n\"Splash splash!!\"\n\nHe rinsed his mouth, spat, wet a towel, and started wiping his face. Lawyer An sat on the small stool under the showerhead, waiting silently for Xu Qinglang to finish washing up and leave so he could continue his shower.\n\nBut after Xu Qinglang finished washing up, he opened the mirror above the sink. Inside was a small storage shelf, filled with a dazzling array of skincare products. Queen sets, premium sets… Seeing Xu Qinglang take them out one by one and use them, lawyer An, still covered in body wash, said indignantly, \"How much longer are you going to put on?\"\n\n\"Who told you to bring someone back early in the morning and wake me up? Lack of sleep has the biggest impact on the skin.\"\n\n\"...Lawyer An.\n\n...\n\nThe old Taoist priest sat beside Old Zhang, looking at the transformed Old Zhang. He felt a bit emotional. People often say that good people don't get good rewards, and he wondered if Old Zhang's current situation was a good reward. Because he met the boss, he received the boss's help? However, no matter what, the old Taoist priest always had a simple philosophy: no matter what hardships one experiences, as long as one is alive, it's fine; there is hope. Well, even if his appearance changed and his DNA fingerprint changed, as long as he was alive, it was fine.\n\nThe little monkey also walked in, wearing a nightcap and children's clothes bought by the old Taoist priest. He was holding a toy hammer.\n\n\"Monkey, pour me a cup of tea.\"\n\nThe little monkey nodded and ran out. After a while, it brought back the old Taoist priest's teacup. Normally, such a small monkey wouldn't have the strength, but the little monkey was different from ordinary monkeys. It was once a demon monkey and had undergone transformation and rebirth by receiving the skin of a mountain-moving ape. Besides, have you ever seen a monkey that knows how to call Didi?\n\nThe old Taoist priest took the teacup and took two sips.\n\nJust then, Old Zhang, lying on the bed, suddenly showed a pained expression, and his hands and feet began to move slightly.\n\n\"My goodness!\" The old Taoist priest immediately put down his teacup and shouted, \"Old Zhang is waking up, he's waking up!\"\n\nGiven Xu Qinglang's previous experience, and considering that the boss used to fall into a coma for a week every time he went on a rampage, the old Taoist priest had prepared himself for Old Zhang to be in a coma for a long time. To his surprise, Old Zhang seemed to have the luck of the righteous and was already showing signs of waking up.\n\nHowever, as soon as the old Taoist priest shouted, Old Zhang on the bed suddenly lunged forward, grabbing the old Taoist priest's neck tightly with one hand and entwining his legs around the old Taoist priest's body. His eyes were tightly closed, his brows furrowed, and cold sweat dripped down. At the same time, he was shouting frantically:\n\n\"Run! Run! Teacher, quickly take the children and run, run quickly, run!!!\"\n\n...\n\nThe first day of August, asking for monthly tickets!",

    "content": "\"Welcome to Your Moon, My Heart,\n\nThe good man is me,\n\nI am—Midnight Horror Broadcast.\"\n\nThe woman hadn't appeared yet,\n\nInside the prison, everything seemed normal,\n\nOutside the car window, the annoying cicadas chirped incessantly.\n\nBoss Zhou, unable to sleep, had smoked all his cigarettes,\n\nBored, he turned on the car radio.\n\n\"Alright, just kidding everyone. The movie version of 'iPartment' will be out soon. We remind everyone here that those who like this movie can go to the cinema to watch it.\n\nAlso, tonight, we bring you a story written by the famous contemporary youth writer Xia Xie, titled 'My Day Trip to Hell.'\n\nIn this story, Xia Xie vividly depicts his vision of hell for us readers, drawing us into its depths.\n\nAt the new book launch, Xia Xie said that when he was a child, he was in a car accident and was in a coma for a few days. During those days, he had a very, very long dream. He said he might have gone to hell and then returned. So, when he grew up, he decided to use his pen to write about the customs and traditions of the hell he 'saw' for everyone to read.\n\nNext,\n\nWe will tell this story to our listeners:\n\n'The Yellow Springs Road stretches endlessly, with beautiful and tender lycoris radiata flowers blooming on both sides, swaying their forms.\n\nSouls of all kinds walk on the Yellow Springs Road,\n\nSome are singing,\n\nSome are dancing,\n\nSome are crying,\n\nSome are looking back,\n\nPeople of all skin colors, all ethnicities, all cultures are here, shedding all their external coverings, returning to their most essential states.\n\nOnly at this time,\n\nWill arrogance and prejudice cease to exist,\n\nAnd wealth and poverty no longer be a barrier...'\n\nHearing this,\n\nBoss Zhou rolled his eyes and sighed,\n\n\"What crap.\"\n\nSinging, dancing,\n\nWhy don't you let the ghost messengers take you all to a Hai Tian Sheng Yan¹?\n\nZhou Ze turned off the radio and rummaged around below. To his surprise, he actually found a pack of cigarettes, likely belonging to the unlucky driver.\n\nThat guy is probably still sleeping blissfully by the roadside,\n\nWonder if he'll catch a cold.\n\nHe opened a pack of cigarettes, but before he could take one,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly froze.\n\nA feeling of palpitations suddenly struck him.\n\nIn the prison,\n\nWhat happened?\n\n...\n\nThe library,\n\nThe prisoner and the woman.\n\nThe prisoner remained seated,\n\nThe woman, terrified, kept backing away,\n\nMuttering in panic,\n\n\"Why, how is this possible, how is this possible...\"\n\nA smile played on the prisoner's lips,\n\nHis eyes,\n\nHeld a deep, reminiscent gaze.\n\n...\n\nThat day,\n\nIt rained heavily,\n\nAnd there was thunder.\n\nLightning flashed intermittently, followed by rumbling thunder.\n\nHe hadn't been home for three days, too busy to return.\n\nIt was the Mid-Autumn Festival,\n\nThe food factory had many tasks and orders, but they couldn't afford to miss any of them. The Mid-Autumn Festival orders accounted for more than one-third of the entire factory's annual orders.\n\nHis mother-in-law had entrusted the management of this factory to him, her son-in-law. This was his responsibility.\n\nIn his mother-in-law's words,\n\nHer husband and eldest son were too rigid. Besides being policemen, they knew nothing else. She didn't expect them to be adaptable and bring in extra income for the family. So, she had to earn money herself to supplement the household expenses.\n\nThis factory could now only be managed by her son-in-law.\n\nHe was very dedicated, truly dedicated, and tried his best.\n\nHis father-in-law's family, including his elder brother-in-law, treated him very well. They never looked down on his background. Even when discussing marriage with his wife, they didn't set any hurdles or make any demands.\n\nTherefore, he could only work as hard as possible, strive his best, even if it meant he no longer had time to write novels or the energy to pursue his dreams. Moreover, he and his wife met because of their shared interest in writing novels.\n\nBut he had no regrets, not a single regret. A man must learn to bear responsibilities and know what he must give up.\n\nDragging his exhausted body,\n\nHe drove home.\n\nThis was his own villa.\n\nHe had never imagined that he would one day live in a villa, not a house built by his family in the countryside, but in a high-end villa community.\n\nA beautiful life was not just before his eyes; it was already in his hands.\n\nA loving wife,\n\nChildren,\n\nA house,\n\nA career,\n\nHe had it all.\n\nHe parked the car and, upon reaching the door, remembered he'd left his access card in the car. He rang the doorbell, and after a long wait, no one opened it.\n\nAt this hour,\n\nThe children might have already fallen asleep. If his wife was writing and had closed herself in her study, she might not hear him, as the study was designed to be soundproof.\n\nBut the housekeeper should have opened the door.\n\nHe rang the doorbell a few more times, still no one opened.\n\nWith no other choice, he had to return to the car to get his access card and walked back to the door. He used the card to open it.\n\nPushing the door open and entering the living room, he froze. On the living room floor, his wife and two children were tied up.\n\nHe rushed towards them as if he had gone mad, trying to wake his wife, trying to wake his children.\n\nBut they showed no reaction.\n\nHis wife and children had bruises on them, as if they had been whipped and tortured. And most critically, all three of them had stopped breathing.\n\nThe housekeeper was not at home; he didn't know where she had gone.\n\nThis must be a dream,\n\nThis must be a dream,\n\nIt must be a dream.\n\nHow could something like this happen?\n\nImpossible,\n\nAbsolutely impossible.\n\nHe didn't call the police. He silently untied the ropes around his wife and children and laid them on the sofa.\n\nWhen people are subjected to extreme shock, they often react in a strange manner.\n\nCalling the police,\n\nWhat's the use?\n\nHis wife and two children were already dead.\n\nHe didn't cry or scream,\n\nHe just silently looked at his wife and two children lying on the sofa.\n\nHe watched for a long time,\n\nUntil his head turned white,\n\nUntil he felt completely dazed.\n\nHe went upstairs to the bedroom. He lay down, pulled up the covers, and rested his head on the pillow.\n\nThis is a dream, right?\n\nSo tired.\n\nWhen he wakes up,\n\nNothing should be left.\n\nHe fell asleep.\n\nUnder these circumstances,\n\nHe truly fell asleep.\n\nAnd slept until dawn.\n\nWhen he woke up,\n\nHe found his wife was not lying beside him. He went to the children's room. It was summer vacation, so the children didn't have to go to school. He disliked making his children attend cram schools at an early age, preferring them to play freely at home. They were of an age to play.\n\nThe children's bedroom was also empty.\n\nHe suddenly remembered the scene from when he returned home last night.\n\nHe covered his mouth with one hand,\n\nHis eyes wide open.\n\nHe dared not go downstairs.\n\nHe remembered putting the bodies of his wife and children on the living room sofa last night. He didn't dare to go down, afraid of seeing that scene again.\n\nCall the police?\n\nSorry,\n\nI really didn't think of it, nor did I consider it.\n\nWhy should I call the police?\n\nIs it to catch the killer?\n\nThere is no killer,\n\nMy wife and children are still alive.\n\nYes,\n\nThey are clearly still alive. Why would I call the police?\n\n...\n\nMore than ten years ago, in Osaka, Japan, a university professor lived with his wife's corpse for three years after she passed away in her sleep from a sudden heart attack.\n\nDuring this period, he always believed that his wife was merely asleep and not dead. He even bought a freezer to house his wife's body. Initially, he told the outside world that his wife had broken her leg and couldn't go out. Later, he claimed his wife had gone abroad for further studies.\n\nIn this way, his wife's death was hidden for three years with various excuses. It wasn't until his wife's father fell ill and was hospitalized that her family strongly requested his wife to return to see the elder. Finally, the professor's lie was exposed.\n\nThe police and others stormed into the professor's house and found the corpse in the freezer. At first, people suspected the professor had killed his wife and hidden the body to destroy evidence.\n\nBut the professor insisted that his wife was not dead, and that she had breakfast and dinner with him every day and slept with him.\n\nWhen those around him kept telling him that his wife was dead and had been dead for three years, it was as if a dream within his heart was shattered.\n\nThe professor knelt by his wife's corpse and sobbed uncontrollably.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nHe finally realized,\n\nThat his wife was dead.\n\nLater, after police investigation, because the body was well-preserved, the cause of death was confirmed, and the professor was cleared of the murder suspicion.\n\n...\n\nHe dared not go downstairs.\n\nWhy dare not?\n\nHe didn't understand.\n\nBut he just didn't want to go down.\n\nHe silently walked to the study.\n\nHis wife usually wrote there. Her notebook was still on the desk.\n\nHis wife used to laugh at him, saying he disliked using computers when he wrote, preferring to use a fountain pen. She said he even mailed manuscripts to publishers and magazines with his fountain pen, only for them to be returned with a note requesting submissions via email, not handwritten manuscripts.\n\nBut he still insisted on writing stories with his fountain pen, even if he typed them into the computer after finishing. He felt that the words and stories written with a fountain pen had emotion, warmth, were not cold, and were more vibrant.\n\nHis fountain pen was bought at a street stall when he was a child. It was his first fountain pen and had never broken. It had no brand or trademark, but it was still usable and of excellent quality.\n\nHowever,\n\nAfter getting married and taking over his mother-in-law's food factory, he rarely used this fountain pen to write his own stories anymore.\n\nBut he would use the fountain pen to copy his wife's published books, transcribe them, and then read them slowly. He enjoyed this feeling and liked this feeling.\n\nHe picked up the fountain pen,\n\nOpened his blank notebook,\n\nAnd picked up a book his wife had published recently, \"My Home, I Love My Home.\"\n\nThis horror story was based on their own home as the inspiration for his wife's creation.\n\nThe crimson cover lettering signaled that this was a horror novel.\n\nOpening the first page,\n\nHe began to meticulously copy the title, sentence by sentence...",

    "content": "My wife's novels have always been niche, because she always liked this kind of horror story. Actually, she used to write romance novels.\n\nFor example, those like \"Domineering CEO, Little Goblin, You Are Mine, Don't Run!\"\n\nHowever,\n\nPerhaps it was due to postpartum depression, which led her to lean towards horror and the supernatural in her writing.\n\nBut my wife's condition wasn't severe. She might have become a bit colder than before, and less inclined to go out or interact with strangers, but she was still warm and considerate towards herself and our child.\n\nHolding the fountain pen,\n\nHe sat there, copying word by word.\n\nActually,\n\nAt first,\n\nMy wife didn't quite understand this habit of mine.\n\nLater, I explained that since they were her books and her stories, writing them down with a fountain pen and then rereading them would allow me to connect more deeply with her inner world.\n\nMy wife was very moved.\n\nFor writers,\n\nSuch free sweet talk can be sold off wholesale, but women seem to enjoy this kind of thing.\n\nBecause of this,\n\nEvery time my wife published a new work, and I took the time to copy it,\n\nMy wife would like to sit next to me, watch me, and if she was tired, she would lean on me, watching me copy, enjoying the feeling.\n\nThe pen tip, continuously wrote one word after another on the paper.\n\nHe didn't look back,\n\nNor did he look around.\n\nBecause he already had the feeling that his wife was by his side, accompanying him.\n\nMy wife was by his side,\n\nYes,\n\nShe was by his side.\n\nIn the living room,\n\nThree bodies were still quietly laid out on the sofa.\n\nOn the second floor,\n\nThe deceased's husband (father),\n\nWas sitting properly in the study, writing with a fountain pen.\n\nThis was like a horror scene from a black-and-white film,\n\nCarrying a chaotic logic that was difficult to understand yet made one's scalp tingle.\n\nIt was a bit like performance art.\n\nTrue performance art should not be scrutinized for its logic, but rather, within the chaos, one should search for the meaning it seeks to convey.\n\nHe didn't go to work today.\n\nAfter the Mid-Autumn Festival, it was already a holiday, and the factory workers, after days of overtime, also needed time to rest.\n\nMoreover, with the busiest period over, the factory wouldn't be as busy for a while.\n\nHis father-in-law and mother-in-law were traveling abroad. Because of his wife's increasingly cold demeanor, she rarely initiated contact or calls with them. His in-laws also rarely bothered their lives.\n\nAs for his brother-in-law, who was a police officer,\n\nHe was so busy with work that he was \"divorced and separated from his children,\"\n\nNaturally, he didn't have time to visit or drop by.\n\nAll day long,\n\nHe was copying.\n\nCopying very diligently.\n\nEvery stroke, every line, was written with extreme neatness, completely engrossed.\n\nAll day long,\n\nNo eating, no drinking.\n\nHe didn't even move from his seat.\n\nHe just kept writing, writing,\n\nHe wrote until the sun went down,\n\nHe wrote until the moon rose,\n\nFrom daylight to darkness…\n\nHe became numb.\n\nHe couldn't feel the passage of time. It seemed that only this continuous copying could make him forget what he didn't want to remember, and allow him to feel the warmth and attachment he wished to feel.\n\nThe most magical thing was,\n\nThe fountain pen,\n\nWithout even changing the ink,\n\nIt was as if it could write endlessly.\n\nThe ink here,\n\nWas inexhaustible.\n\nInstead, his hand, which was tightly gripping the fountain pen,\n\nBegan to show bulging veins,\n\nDisplaying the state that the intern nurse sisters liked the most.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nBy the latter half of the night,\n\nThis horror story with a blood-red cover, \"I Love My Home,\" was finally finished copying.\n\nHe leaned back, stretched, and felt a crisp crackle from his joints. The physical fatigue seemed completely imperceptible. Instead, his spirit felt even more invigorated.\n\n\"Creak!\"\n\nThe bedroom door was pushed open,\n\nRevealing a large dog's head.\n\nIt was an Alaskan Malamute.\n\nAt home,\n\nThere was no dog.\n\nHe remembered when they first got married, he and his wife had a puppy Alaskan Malamute. Later, because his wife became pregnant, the dog had to be given away.\n\nAs the two children grew older, due to her change in personality, his wife didn't have much motivation to keep a dog. Because a dog is also a life, bringing it home, feeding it, bathing it, and taking care of it is no less than taking care of a child.\n\nBut deep down, his wife still liked dogs.\n\nIn the book he had just finished copying, there was a dog, an adult Alaskan Malamute.\n\nIt liked to eat ham sausages, was very smart, could sit and shake hands, and could even take children for walks.\n\nThe Alaskan Malamute walked in, nudged its head against his knees, and gently rubbed against him.\n\nHe reached out,\n\nAnd petted,\n\nThe dog's head.\n\nThen,\n\nHe slowly stood up.\n\nThe dog blocked him, preventing him from leaving. It looked up at him, drooling, and it was hungry, begging for food.\n\nIn his wife's story,\n\nThis dog was very cute, sensible, and obedient.\n\nIt liked to eat ham sausages,\n\nBut what it actually needed to eat every day was not ham sausages or dog food,\n\nBut the fresh blood of living people.\n\nIn the story, every night, it would go out for a period of time to forage.\n\nIt would go out and bite people, sucking their blood before returning. Those who had their blood sucked would only feel a moment of dizziness, a bit of lethargy, and would have no other problems, not even realizing what had just happened.\n\nThe amount of blood it sucked was actually the karmic debt of the target. People who had committed little evil, done few bad deeds, would only have a little blood sucked. If they were thorough villains, they could even be sucked to death. Of course, if they were good people, it wouldn't find them at all.\n\nHe remembered his wife saying that the Alaskan Malamute in her original manuscript wasn't set up like this. She wanted to write about a dog that went out to casually and imperceptibly suck blood when it was hungry, a devil outside and a good pet at home, a good companion for the children.\n\nThis was the feeling she wanted, but due to publication and policy reasons, she had to modify it.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\"\n\nHe pricked his palm with the fountain pen, watching the blood drip down.\n\nBut the Alaskan Malamute just shook its head, uninterested in his blood.\n\n\"If you're hungry, go find something to eat.\"\n\nHe reached out and unclipped the leash from the Alaskan Malamute's neck.\n\nThe Alaskan Malamute wagged its tail happily and ran out.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nHe walked out of the study.\n\nHe hadn't gone downstairs for a day and a night, and he was still a little afraid to go down.\n\nEven though,\n\nHe had seen the dog.\n\nStanding at the top of the stairs, he hesitated for a long time and worried for a long time. He still hadn't dared to take the first step down.\n\nUntil,\n\nHe heard the crisp laughter of children from below.\n\n\"Hehehe... Brother... I want to eat... I want to eat too...\"\n\n\"No, no... Mommy says eating too many candies will make your teeth bad... Sister, you're not allowed to eat... Brother eats... for your bad teeth...\"\n\n\"Brother is bad... Mommy... Brother is too bad...\"\n\nThe children were chasing each other below.\n\nAlthough he and his wife often told their son to look after his sister, their son, who was still young, often teased his sister.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nIn his heart,\n\nCourage emerged.\n\nHe walked downstairs.\n\nThe children were chasing and playing.\n\nHis sister couldn't catch up to her brother and stood there, sulking. Seeing him come down, she immediately ran to his side, hugged his thigh, and shouted,\n\n\"Daddy, Brother is bad, spank him!\"\n\nHe reached out and stroked his daughter's head.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nHe felt like crying.\n\nHis nose began to sting.\n\n\"I didn't, I didn't. Daddy, don't listen to sister's nonsense. She ate all her candy and wants mine.\"\n\nHis son also hurried over to explain.\n\nHis children were gathered around him.\n\nThey were arguing.\n\nThey were complaining to him.\n\nThis feeling,\n\nWas not annoying at all.\n\nInstead, it felt very wonderful.\n\n\"Crash!\"\n\nHis wife pushed open the kitchen door.\n\nWearing an apron, she walked out from inside and leaned against the doorframe, complaining with some dissatisfaction,\n\n\"The auntie took leave and went home today. I just made something casually. Eat whatever you can. Your wife can't cook. You should have known this when you were chasing me.\"\n\n\"It'll all be eaten, of course.\"\n\nHe said excitedly.\n\nHis wife smiled and urged, \"Take the children to wash their hands, it's time to eat.\"\n\nHe took the children to wash their hands and went into the bathroom. The two children were very well-behaved, lathering soap and washing their little hands diligently.\n\nHe, on the other hand, looked at himself in the mirror.\n\nHis face was gaunt, extremely haggard, his face pale, and he had lost a lot of his color.\n\nHe must be too tired. He had been extremely busy lately.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nHe really needed to get more rest.\n\nBringing the children out, his wife had already set the bowls and chopsticks on the coffee table. The family sat down.\n\n\"Yolk isn't back yet,\" his daughter asked.\n\nYolk was the name of the Alaskan Malamute.\n\n\"If you want to eat, Yolk also wants to eat. It's out looking for food,\" his wife said.\n\nHis daughter nodded. \"I hope Yolk can eat its fill today and play with me properly tonight.\"\n\n\"You also need to eat your fill so you have the strength to play with Yolk.\"\n\nHe took a bite of rice. The rice was cooked a little too soft, with a bit too much water, but he found it exceptionally delicious and very fragrant.\n\nHe stood up, picked up the remote control from the coffee table, and turned on the television.\n\nThe television was broadcasting local news.\n\n\"We have just received news that in the late afternoon, at the bank entrance on the west section of Jianshe Road in Chongchuan District, a woman was bitten to death by a large dog. The dog's whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nThe issue of dog owners not using leashes when walking their dogs in the city is becoming increasingly serious. We appeal to dog owners to be civilized and not cause trouble or harm to others. We hope such tragedies will not happen again.\n\nAt the same time, we hope the municipal government can strengthen management and supervision in this area, improve urban pet management, and perfect regulations.\n\nIt is understood that,\n\nWhat is noteworthy is that,\n\nThe deceased woman was a domestic helper, forty years old, and not from Tongcheng.\n\nThe police investigated her ID information and found that it did not match the person.\n\nCurrently, the woman's true identity has been verified. She has multiple records of huge debts and was an escapee from debt who used someone else's ID to register with an employment agency.\n\nBefore the incident,\n\nShe had just finished work at the high-end villa complex where she was employed...\"\n\n——————\n\nAn additional chapter for one thousand monthly tickets!",

    "content": "After dinner, he helped his wife with the dishes, then played some family games with the children. After settling the children into bed, he returned to his own room.\n\nHis wife was showering in the bathroom inside the room. The sound of running water was tantalizing.\n\nHe lay on the bed, propped up by his hands, looking at the wedding photo hanging on the wall.\n\nIn the photo, he was still young, and his wife was in her prime.\n\nAs he lay there,\n\nHe closed his eyes,\n\nAnd fell asleep again.\n\nHe didn't know how long he slept. When he woke up, it was dark all around. He reached out in the darkness, fumbling, and turned on the light.\n\nThe bed was still the same bed, but he was alone in it.\n\nSilently,\n\nHe sat up in bed,\n\nCurling himself up.\n\nA feeling of loneliness and cold began to wash over him.\n\nFragmented images started to flood his mind.\n\nDark clouds,\n\nLightning,\n\nHeavy rain,\n\nThe living room,\n\nThe sofa…\n\nHe felt increasingly breathless, and a sense of \"despair\" began to engulf him, causing goosebumps to prickle all over his skin.\n\nHe dared not leave the bedroom,\n\nDared not push open the door.\n\nHe was afraid he wouldn't hear the children's voices,\n\nAfraid he wouldn't see his wife,\n\nAnd even more afraid to go downstairs,\n\nTo see on the living room sofa…\n\n\"Huff… huff… huff…\"\n\nThe heavy gasps made his mind grow even blanker.\n\nStruggling, he tiptoed like a thief to open the bedroom door, closed his eyes, covered his ears, and, following his memory, rushed into the study next door.\n\n\"Slam!\"\n\nThe moment he closed the study door,\n\nHe felt as if a stone had been lifted from his heart.\n\nHis cloudy gaze fell upon the fountain pen lying silently on the desk,\n\nAs if he had found his anchor.\n\nHe walked over,\n\nPicked up the fountain pen,\n\nOpened a blank notebook,\n\nAnd took out his wife's book, \"The Double-Faced Man,\" to continue transcribing.\n\nHe was absorbed,\n\nHe was engrossed,\n\nAside from transcribing the words,\n\nHe had no other thoughts, nor dared he.\n\nNo one was rushing him, yet he cherished his time exceptionally.\n\nHe wrote quickly, his handwriting becoming messy, because his heart was already impatient.\n\nHe didn't notice,\n\nHis skin had begun to wrinkle, like the bark of an elm tree that had lost its moisture. He also didn't notice his eye sockets slowly caving in, and though he wasn't yet thirty, large patches of white hair had appeared on his head.\n\nThe ink in the fountain pen,\n\nStill seemed inexhaustible,\n\nContinuing to write words,\n\nWithout needing to be refilled.\n\nAs he wrote,\n\nHe wrote until the sky turned white, then until it became dim again.\n\nThe doorbell rang from the direction of the bedroom door. He stood up abruptly, pushed open the room door, and walked out.\n\nStanding on the second floor,\n\nHe saw his wife below, walking over,\n\nOpening the door.\n\nThere were guests,\n\nSaid to be a devoted female fan of his wife.\n\nThe children's laughter echoed again.\n\nThey were watching cartoons on the living room sofa.\n\nSeeing this scene,\n\nHe grinned,\n\nAnd smiled.\n\nEven though he was incredibly haggard,\n\nHis dry, cracked lips seemed to be seeping blood.\n\nWriting,\n\nWriting,\n\nHe transcribed one book, then another,\n\nHe simply couldn't stop,\n\nNor did he want to stop.\n\nHe wrote, forgetting to eat or drink,\n\nHe wrote, forgetting to sleep,\n\nExcept for the occasional sounds that prompted him to go out and look,\n\nTo see his wife,\n\nAnd then to see his children,\n\nAnd then return to writing.\n\nHe was afraid that if he stopped writing,\n\nHe wouldn't be able to see them anymore.\n\nHis wife's horror stories were based on their family's villa as the setting, so the story featured their home, her, and their children.\n\nUnder the study's desk lamp,\n\nWas a figure hunched over transcribing books,\n\nThe figure was so thin,\n\nSo thin that the light from the desk lamp seemed to penetrate him.\n\nAs more and more words were written, and more and more books were transcribed,\n\nGradually,\n\nThe young man became thinner and more haggard.\n\nUntil one day,\n\nHe finished transcribing another book,\n\nAnd when he put down the pen,\n\nHis legs were as slender as two chopsticks.\n\nOnly a layer of skin clung tightly to his face,\n\nHis eye sockets no longer held visible eyes, only two glowing orbs, like will-o'-the-wisps, swirled and flickered within…\n\nHe shakily pushed open the door,\n\nAnd walked out.\n\nHe heard his wife's voice,\n\nAnd he heard his children's voices.\n\nAll of this,\n\nWas so beautiful,\n\nSo pleasant to hear.\n\nIt was heavenly music,\n\nIt was the persistence and hope that kept him alive.\n\nHe felt no hardship, no weariness.\n\nWhat is hardship? What, indeed, is weariness?\n\nLeaning on the railing with his hands, he dared not go down. He just watched silently, listened silently, enjoying his own peaceful years.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nHe faintly heard,\n\nHis wife, crying.\n\nHis children, also crying.\n\nHe froze for a moment,\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy were they crying?\n\nThe family,\n\nAll together,\n\nLiving happily,\n\nWhy were they crying?\n\nHe became a little flustered, a little confused. Gripping the stair railing with both hands, he painfully descended step by step.\n\nGoing downstairs,\n\nWas a great challenge for him at this moment.\n\nHe was afraid of falling.\n\nPerhaps if he fell,\n\nHe would crumble into dust.\n\nIt wasn't that he was afraid of turning into dust,\n\nIt was that he was afraid no one would transcribe anymore,\n\nNo one would pick up the pen and write.\n\nBut he still had to go down,\n\nHe had to ask his wife and children,\n\nWhat had happened,\n\nWhy were they crying?\n\nFinally,\n\nHe walked towards the stairs,\n\nPanting, his back hunched, unable to straighten, he fumbled forward.\n\nHe reached the living room and saw the sofa in the center.\n\nHis wife sat in the middle,\n\nHis son and daughter on either side.\n\nHis wife was crying,\n\nHis son was crying,\n\nHis daughter was crying.\n\nOn the floor,\n\nAn Alaskan Malamute lay prone, surrounded by playground equipment, masks, capes, human faces, shadows, and all sorts of terrifying things lurking and flickering.\n\nIn the depths,\n\nOne could still hear the wails, cries, and roars of countless souls!\n\nAll of this,\n\nWere characters, scenes, and props that had appeared in his wife's horror novels.\n\nHe didn't find it strange, nor did he think it was a big deal.\n\nHe opened his mouth, wanting to ask his wife, wanting to ask his children,\n\nYou,\n\nWhy are you crying?\n\nWe are still alive, we can be together,\n\nIt's beautiful,\n\nIsn't it?\n\nBut all that came out was a hoarse sound, like a mosquito's hum, he couldn't speak.\n\nBlood began to drip from his wife's eyes,\n\nAnd the same from the children's eyes.\n\nThis scene,\n\nTerrified him.\n\nHis wife and children crawled off the sofa together,\n\nCrawling towards him.\n\nHe saw his wife's hands gripping his legs, pleading, praying, crying bitterly.\n\nHe saw his two children doing the same.\n\n\"Darling, please let me go, let me go, I can't take it anymore, I really can't take this torment, I truly can't take it, please let me go, please, darling, let me go, let me go…\"\n\n\"Dad, please let us go… it's too terrifying here, every day is so painful, Nannan is so scared…\"\n\n\"Dad, please let us go, my sister and I can't take it anymore, we really can't take it anymore…\"\n\nLooking at his wife and children beneath him, their faces contorted in pain,\n\nA thunderclap erupted in his mind.\n\nHe staggered backward,\n\nShaking his head,\n\nFull of disbelief.\n\nWhy,\n\nWhy,\n\nHow could this happen?\n\nNo,\n\nImpossible,\n\nIt's impossible!\n\nThe originally cold reality,\n\nWhen veiled with beautiful silk, created a magnificent illusion.\n\nIllusions, after all, are illusions.\n\nHe prostrated himself on the ground,\n\nHolding his head with his hands.\n\nDuring these days, he had been transcribing and writing in the study, never leaving the room.\n\nBut in the outside world,\n\nHe still appeared in public every day, directing workers in the factory to complete orders. After the previous housekeeper had a problem, he had even hired a new one.\n\nAll of this,\n\nWas done by him,\n\nBut he didn't know it,\n\nNor did he realize it.\n\nHe only knew,\n\nWhen his wife and children begged him to let them go before his eyes,\n\nHe collapsed,\n\nFalling into a daze.\n\nHis vision began to blur,\n\nIn this blurred vision,\n\nHe saw the new nanny arrive, saw the bodies of his wife and children on the sofa, and heard her scream. On the coffee table was a \"suicide note\" written by his wife, containing the words she had said when begging him to let them go. Following an instinct, as if transcribing his wife's published books, he had also written it down, in black and white.\n\nThis, along with the old bruises on his wife and children, became the evidence for his conviction of domestic violence and abuse.\n\nThe entanglement of reality and virtuality,\n\nCollapsed and was reshaped countless times in his mind. In prison, he had ample time to reflect, to sort out his thoughts.\n\nTherefore,\n\nHe was very grateful for the prison environment.\n\nA gratitude from the bottom of his heart.\n\n…………\n\nThe gaze of recollection slowly faded,\n\nThe corners of his mouth gradually formed a curve.\n\nHe tried to reclaim his life, but discovered a shocking reality:\n\nHe existed,\n\nBut he also didn't exist.\n\nPeople around him could see him, talk to him, and the prison authorities praised him. His writings were even published and won awards.\n\nBut,\n\nDid he truly exist?\n\nHe felt as if he had become a true ghost,\n\nNot the ghost of a spirit,\n\nBut rather, everyone knew you,\n\nAnd you,\n\nDid not exist.\n\nThis was a paradox, and a torment.\n\nHe spent over four years in prison to figure this out.\n\nLooking at the terrified woman before him,\n\nHe opened his mouth,\n\nMade a \"shushing\" gesture with his lips,\n\nAnd then,\n\nSlowly said:\n\n\"Perhaps, I finally know what the method of using this pen is.\"\n\n\"What… what is it…\"\n\nThe woman from the Bridge of Helplessness looked at the man before her with genuine fear.\n\n\"It's to make yourself… a character in the story, rather than a… living person.\"\n\nThe prisoner took a deep breath,\n\nLeaned back against the chair,\n\n\"So, why did things go so smoothly, you come out of hell, and can immediately find me?\n\nSo smoothly,\n\nAs if it were a pre-arranged plotline,\n\nRight?\"\n\nThe woman nodded.\n\nYes,\n\nIt was too smooth.\n\n\"Heh heh…\"\n\nThe prisoner chuckled.\n\n\"I'm sorry to tell you, my ability isn't enough for this story, it's collapsed…\n\nSorry,\n\nFor dragging you down,\n\nWith me,\n\nLet's disappear together.\"\n\n………………\n\nIn the bedroom on the second floor of the book house,\n\nLawyer An, who had just freed the old Taoist priest from his restraints, sat by the bed. The old Taoist priest had gone downstairs to get some medicinal oil. Zhang Yanfeng, after being stopped by Lawyer An, had fallen back into a coma.\n\nBut his breathing had stabilized, his heartbeat had returned, and after a good sleep, he would likely wake up completely. Everything was developing in a positive direction.\n\nLawyer An felt it was a bit miraculous, that the soul of an ordinary person who had just died had successfully possessed a corpse.\n\nWhile wiping water droplets from his hair with a towel, he picked up the magazine \"Prison Life.\"\n\nHe casually flipped through it.\n\nThe first half of the magazine contained speeches from prison officials and stories of their achievements.\n\nThe latter half contained reflections and experiences of reform written by inmates.\n\nIt was quite interesting to read.\n\nAs he read,\n\nHe flipped to the last page.\n\nHmm?\n\nLawyer An paused for a moment.\n\nIt was the last page,\n\nBut something seemed to be missing.\n\nIt was as if an article should have been there, one he seemed to have read before,\n\nBut it was gone.\n\nDid I,\n\nRemember incorrectly?\n\n————————\n\nThis is a bonus chapter for two thousand monthly votes,\n\nBut embarrassingly, we only have 1800 monthly votes.\n\nBrothers, please give us your support!\n\nSalty Fish Dragon's bonus chapters have already surpassed the monthly votes!\n\nWaaah!",

    "content": "Shaking the ash from his cigarette,\n\nZhou Ze yawned again,\n\nStretching his neck,\n\nThe movement, however, came to an abrupt halt.\n\nBecause he suddenly forgot\n\nwhy he had come here.\n\nIn the middle of the night,\n\nwhy wasn't he in the bookstore, snuggling with Bai Yingying,\n\nbut instead driving a long way to the prison entrance to feel the breeze?\n\nThe logic in his mind was twisted and broken in an instant, as if a crucial piece had been forcefully pulled out, leaving the rest feeling disconnected and incomplete.\n\nZhou Ze tried to sort out his thoughts.\n\nHe remembered he was supposed to be in the hospital saving Zhang Yanfeng. Then Zhang Yanfeng's soul drifted to the pig's head meat shop. There was a traffic light at the pig's head meat shop, and then he met An Buqi. An Buqi had prepared a body, allowing Zhang Yanfeng to possess it and even using the Ghost Messenger certificate he had given him.\n\nNo,\n\nSomething felt wrong.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head,\n\nforcing himself to think hard,\n\nbecause the biggest paradox was, why had he driven to the prison?\n\nWhat was his purpose for coming to the prison?\n\nHe couldn't remember,\n\nnot at all.\n\nIf he said he was bored at night and went for a drive, and his thoughts wandered, leading him to this desolate place without realizing it, it could be explained, albeit a bit stiffly.\n\nBut looking at the car he was sitting in, it wasn't Lawyer An's car, nor Old Xu's Nissan. Beneath the groove beside him was a driver's license with another stranger's photo and name.\n\nIf an ordinary person encountered this situation,\n\nthey might think their memory had failed,\n\nor cover their mouths and exclaim that they had encountered a \"supernatural event.\"\n\nBut the problem was, could Zhou Ze mimic an exclamation of \"How terrifying, I've encountered a supernatural event\"?\n\nPushing open the car door,\n\nZhou Ze got out, constantly looking around.\n\nThe towering prison walls were not far ahead.\n\nThere were no cars on the road at the prison entrance late at night.\n\nCicadas chirped incessantly all around.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes would widen and then narrow.\n\n\"Who am I,\n\nwhere do I come from,\n\nwhere am I going?\"\n\nGritting his teeth,\n\nZhou Ze felt he should do something.\n\nHis sudden amnesia made him feel very insecure.\n\nTaking out his phone,\n\nhe dialed Lawyer An.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze remembered meeting Lawyer An before coming to the prison.\n\nThe call was answered quickly.\n\n\"Hello, boss.\"\n\n\"Old An, do you know where I am now?\"\n\n\"How would I know.\" An Buqi was confused. Then, as if he had thought of something, he immediately said, \"That police officer has woken up. He's still asleep, but his body is showing stable breathing and heart rate. It should be fine now.\"\n\nNo,\n\nOld Zhang's matter isn't urgent for now.\n\n\"I'm at the prison entrance. Do you remember why I came to the prison entrance?\"\n\nLawyer An was stunned for a moment.\n\nIn his opinion, if Zhou Ze said he was at the entrance of a club or a vegetable market and asked why he was there, he could answer.\n\nBut asking why he went to the prison entrance in the middle of the night,\n\ndid he want to surrender and go to jail?\n\nOr,\n\nwas he hinting at something else?\n\nWas he implying something to him?\n\n\"Boss.\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"If you have any opinions about me, you can state them directly.\"\n\nThis meant,\n\nno need to beat around the bush or use veiled accusations.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\n\"I have a customer in the prison. Is that why you went? I remember telling you about it, and the profit share will be divided with you. No need to rush, this...\"\n\n\"It's not that.\"\n\nZhou Ze interrupted Lawyer An's rambling.\n\n\"The problem is, I really don't know why I came here in the middle of the night.\"\n\n\"Then... you should come back and rest? Oh, right, boss, I have a request here.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"I saw that little girl pestering the female zombie, wanting to sleep with her. I also asked the old Taoist, and he said you sleep with her too. You see, I'm also suffering from insomnia...\"\n\n\"No way.\"\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nLawyer An felt utterly miserable.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's opinion,\n\nit was tolerable for a little loli to sneak into his bed.\n\nWaking up in the morning to see the voluptuous and charming Bai Yingying, and then the little loli lying beside him, was also a form of enjoyment.\n\nBut if Lawyer An's hairy legs were also present,\n\nhis mood for the entire day would be affected.\n\nEven if Lawyer An wanted to put a mat on the floor and sleep underneath, to get some \"air conditioning,\" it wouldn't work.\n\n\"Then I'll continue meditating,\" Lawyer An said helplessly.\n\n\"I want to go into the prison to have a look,\" Zhou Ze suddenly said.\n\n\"Go into the prison?\"\n\n\"I need to figure out why I came here in the middle of the night.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Ring ring... Ring ring...\"\n\nThe phone rang.\n\nThe prison warden, who was nearing retirement, picked up his phone with some annoyance. It was difficult for him to sleep soundly now that he was older. He would be retiring in a year or two.\n\nBut he dared not ignore a call in the middle of the night, for fear of something happening in the prison.\n\n\"Hello, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Warden, I'm sorry, it's about the selection of model inmates for this quarter. The list needs to be submitted tomorrow, but our prison hasn't finalized the candidates yet.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, not finalized? Didn't we have a meeting last week to discuss it? For that person who writes books, publishes them, and wins awards...\"\n\nThe warden frowned suddenly.\n\nWhat was he talking about?\n\n\"For whom?\"\n\n\"For...\"\n\nThe warden scratched his head and sat up by the bed. Why did he feel like he had forgotten something, or was he just groggy from being woken up by the phone?\n\n\"Find a few more people to study this overnight and submit it directly tomorrow. Make sure it's fair and just, and no favoritism or fraud will be tolerated. If I find out, I will show no mercy!\"\n\n\"Okay, Warden, don't worry.\"\n\nThe call ended.\n\nThe warden, whose hair was already half white, didn't lie down to rest.\n\nInstead, he got up and walked to the bookshelf,\n\nand began to search.\n\nAfter searching for a while,\n\nhe didn't know what he was looking for,\n\nso naturally, he couldn't find anything.\n\nFinally,\n\nhe had to sit down in a chair and light a cigarette.\n\nHis wife was also woken up by him. She came over, looked at him, and asked, \"What's wrong? You seem restless.\"\n\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\nThe warden scratched his hair and smiled at his wife, mocking himself.\n\n\"Maybe it's because I'm old, and as people get older, their memory becomes a problem.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, you're not old. When you retire, I want to travel around with you. We never had the chance before.\"\n\n\"Heh, yeah.\"\n\n...\n\nEntering the detention center wasn't difficult for Zhou Ze. The black mist emanating from his fingernails was enough to make people nearby unable to detect his presence, at least, it was enough to deal with ordinary people.\n\nBoss Zhou didn't dare to make a big fuss and break the iron gate with his fingernails to get in. Instead, he climbed the wall like Spider-Man.\n\nHis fingernails easily embedded into the wall, and he slowly climbed up. The barbed wire and hooks on top were also flattened. After passing two walls like this, Boss Zhou was already panting with exhaustion.\n\nThe prison at night was quiet, like a boarding school.\n\nZhou Ze inserted his fingernails into the ground.\n\nThe black mist began to point in one direction.\n\nIndeed,\n\nthere was something there.\n\nHowever, there were two directions the black mist was pointing, which made Zhou Ze hesitate. For now, he could only choose one direction to go.\n\nThat way was presumably the prison cells. Zhou Ze climbed the wall and reached the second floor.\n\nOn the second floor, near a bunk bed, there was a man lying on the bed. He seemed to sense something and looked at the window in terror. Their eyes met.\n\nHuh?\n\nIs that a prisoner?\n\nAnd wearing a prison uniform?\n\nThe prisoner had a look of bewilderment.\n\nMy God,\n\nthis Ghost Messenger is too dedicated!\n\nHe actually climbed the wall into the prison in the middle of the night to catch him.\n\nThe prisoner's limbs turned cold. He knew from Lawyer An that the Ghost Messengers in Tongcheng were not to be trifled with. At that moment, he was filled with despair.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\nthe scene seemed to change drastically!\n\nThat Ghost Messenger actually smiled at him,\n\nand then gestured for him to sleep well.\n\n\"...\" The prisoner.\n\nYou can kill me or torture me as you please, sending me to hell is fine too.\n\nEven an evil spirit has dignity!\n\nWhat the hell is the meaning of you climbing the wall into the prison in the middle of the night to act like a guard and check on prisoners?\n\nAnd telling me to sleep well,\n\nare you crazy!\n\nBut then,\n\nthe Ghost Messenger really left.\n\nHe,\n\nleft???\n\nDamn it,\n\nhe really,\n\njust like that,\n\nleft?\n\nHe climbed the wall into the prison in the middle of the night and then climbed back here,\n\njust to see if he was sleeping well?\n\nYes, Zhou Ze left because he guessed who it was.\n\nIt should be the customer that Lawyer An said he had placed in prison for \"observation.\"\n\nNow he was also Zhou Ze's customer,\n\nso Boss Zhou chose to ignore him, went downstairs, and headed towards the second direction.\n\nAfter passing the prisoner activity area, Zhou Ze reached the entrance of the prison's small library.\n\nIt wasn't locked, and the light was still on inside.\n\nHe pushed the door open and walked in.\n\nAll around,\n\nthere was a smell of burning,\n\nas if someone had just grilled something here.\n\nAnd then it was specifically disinfected with 84 disinfectant.\n\nIn short,\n\nthe smell made Zhou Ze very uncomfortable, even making him feel like he wanted to vomit.\n\nInexplicably,\n\nan idiom surfaced in Zhou Ze's mind,\n\nwhich was... vanished into thin air.\n\nForcing himself to calm down,\n\nZhou Ze slowly walked towards the lit area. The black mist also began to fade here, and even started to lose its direction.\n\nThis meant that there was something emitting a ghostly aura here before, and now, it had disappeared, to the point that his black mist could not even track it.\n\nThis was the first time Zhou Ze had encountered such a situation.\n\nBut soon,\n\nZhou Ze saw something on the table.\n\nAn old fountain pen, with a slightly damaged surface and an old appearance,\n\nlay quietly on the desktop.\n\nUnder the light,\n\nit reflected an unusual gleam.",

    "content": "Though Zhou Ze had left,\n\nThe inmate lying on the plank bed in the prison cell, who had \"blood in his crotch,\" was in no mood for sleep.\n\nWrapped in his quilt,\n\nHe would occasionally expose his eyes to peek outside,\n\nThen, like a startled quail, he would quickly retract them.\n\nOf course,\n\nHe couldn't sleep even if he wanted to.\n\nBut following his usual habit, he could use the meditation method taught by Lawyer An to alleviate the distress of not being able to sleep. Although the effect wasn't as good or as deep as sleeping, it could at least relieve the torment of insomnia.\n\nHowever,\n\nThis time, as soon as he closed his eyes,\n\nThe scene he saw from the window immediately flashed into his mind:\n\nThat ghost messenger,\n\nHis hawk-like gaze fixed on him,\n\nAnd then he left inexplicably.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nEven if that ghost messenger were to jump in and give him a\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nAnd yell, \"Change your posture and sleep!\"\n\nHe might have been able to maintain a calmer state of mind.\n\nHe felt like a little white rabbit,\n\nAnd the hunter had specifically crossed thousands of miles just to glance at him, say \"Goodnight and sweet dreams,\" and then leave.\n\nThis feeling,\n\nWas incredibly bizarre.\n\n...\n\nThis feeling,\n\nWas indeed incredibly bizarre,\n\nEspecially after Zhou Ze saw this pen.\n\nIt was as if, in the depths of destiny, a venomous snake was lurking within the fountain pen, flicking its tongue, waiting for him to approach.\n\nZhou Ze, the boss, was unwilling to engage in acts of murder for treasure. His bookstore had many fantasy novels, and they all followed this basic plot. Zhou Ze felt that doing such things was beneath him.\n\nHowever,\n\nIn reality,\n\nBoss Zhou was a prime example of saying one thing and doing another.\n\nOutwardly, he would declare he wouldn't do it, absolutely not,\n\nBut in reality, when encountering something good,\n\nWhether it was usable or not,\n\nWhether it was a person or a zombie,\n\nWhether it was a man or a woman,\n\nWhether it was human or beast,\n\nBoss Zhou wanted to pack it all up and take it home.\n\nWang Ke had once analyzed for Zhou Ze that it was probably because he had suffered from poverty in his childhood, so as an adult, he instinctively possessed a very strong possessiveness, or perhaps a collector's obsession.\n\nIt was as if only by hoarding could he gain a sense of security,\n\nOtherwise, he would feel uneasy all day.\n\nThe most typical example was Boss Zhou's Yin-Yang Register. He still didn't understand how to use it specifically, and even the several powerful spirits from Northeast China imprisoned within were still eating dirt in the forgotten corners,\n\nHe couldn't release them even if he wanted to.\n\nHowever,\n\nWhen faced with this pen,\n\nZhou Ze began to feel apprehensive.\n\nAlthough the item looked very plain, so plain that it resembled the first Hero brand fountain pen Zhou Ze bought in primary school.\n\nBut it felt a bit prickly.\n\nBoss Zhou was a bit hesitant.\n\nThe Yin-Yang Register, even if unusable, gave him a sense of accomplishment when kept at home. The Northeast spirits, even if he couldn't control them, felt prestigious to have captured.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe fountain pen before him,\n\nGave Zhou Ze an extremely dangerous feeling.\n\nTaking it back,\n\nCould very well cost him his life.\n\nAlthough he didn't know the specific reason, this premonition was very strong.\n\nDeep breath,\n\nDeep breath,\n\nAnother breath,\n\nContinue breathing,\n\nKeep breathing,\n\nFinally, one more breath!\n\nBoss Zhou turned around,\n\nLeaving behind a decisive and resolute back as he walked away from the pen that lay there quietly, like a woman who had shed most of her clothes, revealing large patches of white.\n\nYes,\n\nBoss Zhou followed his desires,\n\nAnd prepared to leave.\n\nNo matter what treasure it was or what marvelous use it had,\n\nI! DON'T! WANT! IT!\n\nIt seemed that Zhou Ze turned around too quickly, and walked away with too much decisiveness,\n\nEven the pen was caught off guard,\n\nThe pen body trembled slightly,\n\nNearly rolling off the table.\n\nHowever,\n\nAfter walking two steps,\n\nZhou Ze stopped.\n\nHis body began to tremble slightly, and his hands instinctively clenched.\n\nIt wasn't Zhou Ze engaging in an internal struggle or feeling reluctant,\n\nBut because just as Zhou Ze gave up and prepared to leave,\n\nThe consciousness within his body suddenly began to act,\n\nWithout Zhou Ze summoning it, it actively exerted force,\n\nTrying to seize control of his body!\n\nThis had never happened before.\n\nIs it preparing to usurp the throne?\n\nSweat dripped from his forehead, and Zhou Ze gritted his teeth, struggling with that entity.\n\nEven knowing that letting it awaken would be detrimental to him, in situations of danger and necessity, Zhou Ze had still chosen to drink poison to quench his thirst.\n\nNow,\n\nThe bitter fruit,\n\nWas it about to ripen?\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze squatted down. His fingernails began to lengthen, his skin started to turn a dark blue-green, fangs grew from his lips, and in the depths of his eyes, a terrifying darkness flowed incessantly.\n\n\"Take it... take this pen.\"\n\nZhou Ze's suppressed voice transmitted.\n\nBut in the next moment, the blackness in Boss Zhou's eyes receded, and clarity returned.\n\n\"Why!\"\n\nYes, why!\n\nAlthough they were mutually destructive and often found themselves in the same trench, in reality, there was a very clear competitive relationship between the two.\n\nZhou Ze had already decided not to want the pen.\n\nNow that the entity within him wanted it,\n\nHe wanted it even less!\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nBlackness began to permeate Zhou Ze's pupils again,\n\nZhou Ze said sternly:\n\n\"Take it!!!\"\n\nThe next moment,\n\nThe darkness disappeared again, and clarity returned.\n\n\"Impossible!!!\"\n\nIf an outsider were to witness this scene, they would probably think they had encountered a schizophrenic patient, talking to themselves in different tones and voices.\n\n\"Take it, it's useful!\"\n\n\"Don't dream!\"\n\n\"You useless piece of trash!\"\n\nDamn it,\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment.\n\nWhat the hell, it's resorting to personal attacks now!\n\n\"Aren't you a coward too? When the Bridge of Helplessness appeared before, you didn't even dare to reveal your presence!\"\n\nHuh?\n\nWhat is the Bridge of Helplessness?\n\nWhy would I say the Bridge of Helplessness?\n\nZhou Ze fell into thought, but there was no time for it, because the violent aura of the entity within him was raging wildly in his mind.\n\n\"Take it, this pen is useful to me!\"\n\n\"Stop dreaming!\"\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nSuddenly, streams of black mist surged from all directions. Zhou Ze extended his hand towards the location of the fountain pen. The black mist transformed into a sharp claw, swept forward, grasped the fountain pen, and pulled it over.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\nZhou Ze's gaze changed again.\n\nThe sharp claw changed direction, smashing the fountain pen fiercely against the wall!\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe fountain pen, which hit the wall, fell to the ground with a heart-breaking sound.\n\nBut immediately,\n\nThe sharp claw reappeared, grabbed the fountain pen again, and pulled it back!\n\nBut then,\n\nThe sharp claw lost control again, smashing the fountain pen fiercely onto the ground.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\n\"...\" The pen.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\n\"@#￥%&amp;*!!!\" The pen.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe black mist dissipated,\n\nAnd the entity within Zhou Ze, after expending a tremendous amount of energy, unwillingly fell back into slumber.\n\n\"Take it... you must take it... it's not the Judge's Brush... it's...\"\n\nPerhaps,\n\nBecause the entity within him did not yet have the ability to directly confront Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze could also comfort himself, at least this body, this life, still belonged to him.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nHe slumped to the ground,\n\nHis entire body soaked with sweat.\n\nThe fountain pen was already somewhat deformed from being smashed, and even its ink had spilled out. It lay pitifully on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze swallowed, and slowly got up.\n\nThis thing,\n\nHe couldn't have it.\n\nHowever,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nA figure suddenly appeared next to the fountain pen. It was a woman, a stranger yet familiar woman.\n\nMen always have a familiar feeling towards beautiful women.\n\nHey,\n\nBeautiful lady,\n\nHave we met somewhere before?\n\nBut in reality, this woman was not attractive.\n\nEspecially in her current state,\n\nStanding there,\n\nHer eyes were only a stark white, like a puppet, completely devoid of self. In fact, it could be said that her self had been erased.\n\nWhen the woman appeared,\n\nOn the other side,\n\nA man in a prison uniform also appeared.\n\nThe man stood there as well, his gaze vacant.\n\nThe fountain pen began to tremble slightly, as if urging something.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes widened immediately.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThis pen,\n\nHas intelligence!\n\nBoss Zhou had a premonition,\n\nIf he happily took this pen home today,\n\nPerhaps in a few months,\n\nHe would also be standing beside these two,\n\nStaring blankly,\n\nWith vacant eyes,\n\nDazed and confused.\n\nThis was a curse, damn it.\n\nAnd it seemed that even the memories of the living could be erased by this pen. This kind of influence was truly terrifying.\n\nThe woman and the inmate rushed towards Zhou Ze together.\n\nZhou Ze swept them away with his claws, but in the next moment, due to the severe internal struggle and exhaustion, Boss Zhou felt his legs go weak and he knelt on one knee again.\n\nThe two, who had just been torn apart by Zhou Ze's claws, reformed,\n\nAnd numbly continued to charge towards Zhou Ze.\n\nThis time,\n\nZhou Ze had no time to react, and was knocked flying by the two of them, pinned to the ground.\n\nThey each held one hand on him, pressing down firmly, giving a strong sense of spiritual suppression despite lacking physical substance.\n\nZhou Ze prepared to gather his strength to resist,\n\nBut as he raised his chin, he saw that the fountain pen, which had fallen far away,\n\nHad somehow appeared at his chest at some point.\n\nThe pen tip was pointed at him.\n\n\"Take me! I can fulfill your dreams!\"\n\n\"Take me! I can make your wishes come true!\"\n\n\"Take me! I can give you wind when you want it!\"\n\n\"Take me! I can give you rain when you want it!\"\n\nThe man and woman shouted repeatedly at Zhou Ze,\n\nThis seemed to contain some kind of magic,\n\nEnticing people's inner emotions of greed, anger, ignorance, and hatred!\n\nDesiring to possess them!\n\nBut Boss Zhou had resistance to illusions.\n\nAnd the consciousness within him had craved this pen so much that it was willing to expend vital energy to rebel against Boss Zhou, and Zhou Ze had suppressed it without agreeing.\n\nCould a few slogans now make him lose his way?\n\nIf this thing was so useful, the pyramid scheme comrades would have already conquered the world.\n\nBut the two people, while suppressing Zhou Ze, continued to shout,\n\nTheir shouting made Zhou Ze feel somewhat annoyed.\n\nHe directly cursed at the fountain pen in front of him:\n\n\"You imbecile!\"",

    "content": "A man and a woman held him down, restraining his soul, causing his body to stiffen. However, Boss Zhou didn't feel panicked or disoriented.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was unyielding or would rather die than submit. It was because he realized this brush was indeed very mysterious, so mysterious that the consciousness within his body was willing to expend its power to counter him just to obtain it.\n\nBut what tricks can beasts have?\n\nIt couldn't kill him directly, only through temptation and hypnosis, leading him to sink into depravity. At that point, whether man possessed the brush or the brush possessed man would be truly uncertain.\n\nIn short, compared to annihilating an enemy physically, Zhou Ze found this method of crushing an opponent mentally more acceptable.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the tip of the brush suddenly began to tremble, and the man and woman suppressing Zhou Ze also trembled along with it.\n\nThey had been incessantly \"persuading him to surrender,\" shouting slogans.\n\nNow,\n\nThe slogans were like a scratched record,\n\nRepeating in a shaky voice,\n\nBecoming quite bizarre.\n\nAnd the brush seemed to have been provoked. While it was provoking Zhou Ze before, now it appeared to be the brush that became more agitated.\n\nThe brush tip trembled continuously, and at its tip, blood-red ink began to drip out, gradually covering Zhou Ze's chest.\n\nThis red ink was scorching hot, like countless microscopic bugs actively seeping into Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze gasped in pain,\n\nThe script was wrong.\n\nWeren't they supposed to break me mentally?\n\nWhy the switch to the physical?\n\nThe entire rhythm change started from Zhou Ze's exclamation, \"You idiot!\" One could say that the moment before and after uttering those two words was a completely different dividing line.\n\nThe slogans vanished,\n\nThe man and woman also disappeared,\n\nBut Boss Zhou was now infinitely more uncomfortable than before.\n\nAlthough he was freed from restraint and no longer suppressed,\n\nThe sensation on his body, as if thousands of ants were biting and crawling everywhere,\n\nTruly made him want to tear off his own skin and spray insecticide into it.\n\n\"Ahhh!!!\"\n\nA low, suppressed groan of pain escaped his throat.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the ground, his limbs twisting uncontrollably. Many times, he almost couldn't resist digging his own fingernails into the reddened areas.\n\nBut he hesitated. This momentary hesitation cost Zhou Ze the chance for a \"brave severing of the limb.\"\n\nBecause the red ink's spread was astonishingly fast. If it was a matter of severing a limb at the beginning, now it would require scraping the bone for detoxification.\n\nEven,\n\nZhou Ze's lower jaw was already covered by the red ink.\n\nA strong sense of suffocation washed over him,\n\nZhou Ze clutched his throat.\n\nIt was very uncomfortable.\n\nIf a rope were constricting him, he could at least use his hands to resist.\n\nBut now the tightening force was from beneath his skin,\n\nWhat was he supposed to do?\n\nMoreover,\n\nThe red ink continued to spread, and Zhou Ze's face began to turn red, like an actor on a police station stage, wearing makeup.\n\nIn the end,\n\nEven Zhou Ze's eyes were stained by the red ink.\n\nHis vision,\n\nCompletely turned into a bloody hue,\n\nAnd his sight began to blur.\n\n...\n\nBuzz!\n\nBuzz!\n\nBuzz!\n\nThree vibrations sounded.\n\nZhou Ze looked up,\n\nAnd found himself in a pool emitting a pungent smell of alcohol.\n\nAround the pool, rows of grills were displaying various delicacies, being roasted and flipped.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nA group of enchanting beauties were dancing gracefully,\n\nTheir movements alluring,\n\nCaptivating the soul.\n\nNearby,\n\nBeauties had already swarmed him, using their red lips as wine cups, offering drinks.\n\nThis was a literal \"wine pool and meat forest\"!\n\nWhat was this all about?\n\nWas it mental, then physical, and then immediately back to mental?\n\nCould you please have some consistency?\n\nBoss Zhou sat in the pool,\n\nFacing the surrounding beauties and the food and wine,\n\nHe looked on with disdain.\n\nSitting there,\n\nCalm and composed.\n\nBeauty is a man's poison. As the saying goes, heroes cannot overcome the pass of beauties. A man's steadfastness is determined by his resistance when faced with beauty.\n\nAnd Boss Zhou was a leader among them.\n\nIn terms of resistance to beautiful women,\n\nEveryone present,\n\nBefore Boss Zhou, was...\n\nThat white fox¹ had tried to seduce Boss Zhou using such a method back then,\n\nBut Boss Zhou remained calm,\n\nAstonishing the white fox!\n\nCurrently,\n\nThese things,\n\nWere merely trivial matters.\n\nAs if sensing that this scene could not move Zhou Ze,\n\nThe scene immediately began to change.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nZhou Ze stood on a towering pavilion.\n\nBehind him,\n\nA group of men and women in ancient attire knelt.\n\nBelow,\n\nAn army stood in formation, countless armored soldiers cheering in unison.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand,\n\nThe cheers below immediately ceased, becoming solemn and quiet.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand again,\n\nAnd the roaring cheers erupted once more.\n\n\"Boring.\"\n\nZhou Ze rolled his eyes and also looked up,\n\nTowards the sky,\n\nUrging,\n\n\"Change the channel.\"\n\nSuddenly,\n\nThe scene shifted drastically.\n\nAround him, lava flowed, thick black smoke permeated, carrying a suffocating heat.\n\nCountless ghost officers were escorting evil spirits within, and in the distance, over a dozen scrolls floated in mid-air, with people sitting cross-legged behind them, holding brushes.\n\nJudging life and death, determining yin and yang.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's position,\n\nWas on the highest level.\n\nLooking down,\n\nHe found the throne beneath him was made of piled-up bones. In some of the skulls, flattering ghost fires flickered towards him.\n\nWhether ghost officers, inspectors, or judges, all looked in his direction with reverence and fear.\n\nZhou Ze saw countless execution platforms, with all sorts of unimaginable tortures and torments. Cruel punishments like \"lingchi\"² in the human world didn't even qualify to appear here, as they were too gentle.\n\nFurther away,\n\nZhou Ze also saw a giant bridge, the Yellow Springs Road, traversing the underworld, finally leading to that place.\n\nIt wasn't the usual small bridge and flowing water,\n\nBut vast and magnificent, blocking out the sky.\n\nThe Bridge of Sighs³,\n\nWas it really this big?\n\nAnd on the Bridge of Sighs, a woman stood there. Zhou Ze couldn't clearly see her appearance.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to urge the brush,\n\nDamn it,\n\nYou want to tempt me, right?\n\nQuick,\n\nZoom in there,\n\nLet me see that face.\n\nIs that Meng Po⁴?\n\nHave you seen her?\n\nIf you have, hurry up and give a close-up.\n\nThe general description and impression of Meng Po in folklore is of an old woman holding a broken bowl, squatting by the Bridge of Sighs like a beggar. For every ghost that passed, she would offer a bowl of soup, making them forget their past lives and start anew.\n\nBut the reality was certainly not like that. Meng Po wouldn't be so shabby, and likely wouldn't look so old.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe woman's phantom remained a phantom.\n\nThis brush,\n\nIt couldn't write out the woman's detailed appearance,\n\nSo Zhou Ze couldn't see it.\n\nAround the bone throne, fireflies began to gather, and two alluring women emerged from the fireflies, turning their backs to Zhou Ze and crouching down.\n\nIt felt as though,\n\nYou could ravage the entire underworld here at any time.\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nBut only shook his head with a smile.\n\nThe scene changed again,\n\nThis time,\n\nThere were no grand scenes,\n\nNo magnificent landscapes.\n\nGlass,\n\nSunlight,\n\nA sofa,\n\nEven the coffee on the coffee table and the neatly ironed newspaper were so familiar.\n\nThis was,\n\nThe study,\n\nIt was a morning in the study.\n\nZhou Ze, dressed in casual wear, lay on the sofa.\n\nHe picked up his coffee,\n\nSmelled it,\n\nAnd took a sip.\n\nThen he picked up the newspaper and casually flipped through it.\n\nOutside the bookstore,\n\nA group of ghosts,\n\nWere lining up,\n\nLike the elderly lining up early in the morning for supermarket discounts.\n\nThis line stretched into a long dragon.\n\nThe ghosts held number tickets, and entered the bookstore one by one.\n\nAmong them were ghosts of all ages, and even foreign friends of other ethnicities, who had come from afar specifically to go to hell.\n\nAll the ghosts entered the study as if on a pilgrimage,\n\nOne after another,\n\nAnd offered all their underworld currency.\n\nZhou Ze's Adam's apple involuntarily bobbed.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThis scene really stirred my heart!\n\nBut the good times didn't last long,\n\nThe scene changed again, this time it didn't change, it shattered!\n\n\"Hey, let me enjoy it a bit longer.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt somewhat unsatisfied.\n\nThis brush,\n\nIt had just grasped his weakness,\n\nWhy did it give up?\n\nIn a daze,\n\nZhou Ze looked up, surveying his surroundings, and found himself lying on a small boat. Below, the black sea churned violently, exuding a dense aura of death.\n\nIn the air in the distance,\n\nA brush floated there.\n\nThe sea's waves rolled continuously, as if even a slightly larger wave could capsize him.\n\n\"Why choose him.\"\n\nA voice like thunder boomed from below.\n\nInstantly,\n\nLightning and thunder crackled above the sea,\n\nZhou Ze's pathetic small boat was truly precarious.\n\nNow,\n\nZhou Ze could see clearly.\n\nThis below was not the sea, but a human face.\n\nIt was a face,\n\nIdentical to his own face.\n\nHe lay beneath the sea's surface,\n\nCompared to him,\n\nHe was truly too insignificant.\n\nThis was,\n\nThe Sea of the Underworld!\n\nThe colossal face below was the consciousness within his body.\n\nPoverty,\n\nThe disparity between rich and poor,\n\nThe terrifying distance in status and position,\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nOnly now,\n\nDid Zhou Ze truly grasp,\n\nWhat true poverty was.\n\nThis kind of poverty was different from his own and that of Bai Yingying and Xu Qinglang.\n\nThis was a poverty that transcended the level of wealth.\n\nThe brush danced in the air, piercing through the obstructions, and flew towards Zhou Ze.\n\nCompletely ignoring the figure below.\n\n\"Why!\n\nOn what grounds!\"\n\nThe sea surface began to roar, to rage!\n\nHe was the true body,\n\nHe was the true Ying Gou⁵!\n\nAnd this one on the small boat,\n\nWas merely a wisp of consciousness produced by his body during his deep slumber!\n\nThe brush finally landed in Zhou Ze's hand,\n\nAs if trying to please Zhou Ze, it gently nuzzled him.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly noticed,\n\nThat at the base of the brush, a vigorous seal script was carved.\n\n\"煞!\" (Shà - Slaughter/Kill)\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment,\n\nWhat the heck,\n\nYour name is really Shā Bǐ⁶?\n\n---\n\n¹ **White Fox (白狐)**: Likely referring to a mythical creature or a specific character from the story's lore with fox-like attributes, often associated with seduction or illusion.\n\n² **Lingchi (凌遲)**: Also known as \"death by a thousand cuts,\" a brutal form of torture and execution used in imperial China.\n\n³ **Bridge of Sighs (奈何橋)**: In Chinese mythology, this is the bridge souls must cross to reach the afterlife and the reincarnation cycle.\n\n⁴ **Meng Po (孟婆)**: A figure in Chinese mythology who serves a special soup (Meng Po soup) to souls on the Bridge of Sighs, causing them to forget their past lives before reincarnation.\n\n⁵ **Ying Gou (贏勾)**: A powerful figure in Chinese mythology, often associated with the underworld or death. The text implies a conflict between the entity within Zhou Ze and another, possibly more powerful, entity.\n\n⁶ **Shā Bǐ (煞筆)**: A highly offensive Chinese vulgarity.

    "content": "Boss Zhou held the cursed brush, his eyes fixed on it, scrutinizing it carefully. He gently stroked the cursed brush, a strange feeling arising within him. Was it because he had correctly named it, causing it to abandon the consciousness within and seek him out to acknowledge him as master?\n\nNow that he thought about it, at the beginning, this brush was in a state of intense desire to enslave him, wanting to turn him into a puppet like the woman on the Bridge of Helplessness and the prisoner, for it to consume and control. But in the subsequent scenes, this brush was clearly trying to please him, constantly probing his preferences to win his favor, and in the end, it truly found scenes that made him happy, even laughing in his sleep.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze finally understood the profound intentions of this cursed brush. At the same time, he felt immense gratitude. In today's world of vast wealth disparity, he only had a small boat, while the one below him possessed the entire Sea of Netherworld. Even though this was an illusion, and the one below was no longer the master of the Sea of Netherworld, just as the Lord of Mount Tai had long since disappeared and perished, in terms of life levels, strength, and realm, he was utterly outmatched.\n\nIn this situation, it was like a contrast, he was like a small boat about to capsize, while the other was the vast ocean, yet this brush still chose him. He was naturally moved, so moved that Zhou Ze felt like shedding a tear. At the same time, he felt incredibly fortunate. When he was being suppressed earlier, Boss Zhou's mind was purely focused on not losing face and just enjoying a good insult! Fortunately, he had cursed it as \"cursed brush\" and not: \"Your mom's brush,\" \"You joke brush,\" or \"Horse-drawn brush,\" otherwise, everything would have been GG.\n\n\"Boom! Boom! Boom!!!!\" The Nether Sea began to churn, signifying that the other party was now enraged! In his eyes, Zhou Ze was merely his watchdog, a servant for him to hide himself and self-repair. Sometimes, when dealing with a dog, you had to consider its owner, so when Zhou Ze was \"bullied,\" he would come out to resolve the issue. Moreover, Zhou Ze and he shared losses, so whether he liked it or not, he had to accept it; several times he was forced to come out and clean up Zhou Ze's mess.\n\nBut now, the watchdog had taken the very thing he desired most, something that was very important to him at the moment. With it, he could recover faster, and even secure a place to hide when he truly awoke in the future. That was to hide within the story beneath the brushstroke! Originally, he thought this was his own fortuitous encounter, a gift from the Heavenly Dao after witnessing him being exiled by the Yellow Emperor to guard the Nether Sea, and his eventual demise due to that incident. But now, why was that brush in the hands of the watchdog!\n\nHe was, of course, furious, incredibly furious! It was like a prince and a commoner pursuing the same woman, only for the woman to elope with the commoner. How could this be!\n\n\"Can you wield it? Can you control it?\" A massive vortex appeared in the depths of the sea, and that voice emanated from within the vortex, carrying a destructive power, at least in terms of aura.\n\n\"Even if you take it, it will still be mine. You couldn't even master a broken Yin-Yang Register, let alone this brush!\"\n\nSour, truly sour, Zhou Ze chuckled. Seeing him angry genuinely made him happy. \"You won't be able to resist it; it will drag you down. Give it to me, give it to me!\"\n\n\"Never.\" Boss Zhou slowly stood up from the small boat. \"I'm already this poor now. Besides the little boat beneath my feet, all I have left is this cursed brush. And you still want to take it?\"\n\nBoss Zhou was naturally lazy, especially since he had become infatuated with the feeling of being a slacker in this life. But this did not mean that Boss Zhou had become so lazy that he had lost the motivation and desire to live. Because he liked being a slacker, he cherished this life even more, and therefore, he valued his life even more! If it were a worthless life, he would have abandoned it without hesitation, been replaced without a second thought, even erased without caring.\n\nBut now he had his bookstore, a group of employees who accompanied him daily, and the solicitous Yingying. Only a fool would want to give up this life!\n\n\"Heh heh, do you think you can enjoy it for a few more days? Do you think you can exist much longer?\" A cold laugh came from the depths of the sea. \"Originally, I intended to wait until I was ready to awaken, and perhaps you could have lived through this life. But now, I can tell you explicitly, your time is running out! It won't take sixty years, nor ten years, not even one year. Within half a year, I will completely control this body, and you will be utterly erased. I don't even want to integrate your thoughts and existence!\"\n\nThe Nether Sea roared and bellowed. Half a year, is that all that's left? Zhou Ze frowned slightly. It seemed that playing \"Peerless\"¹ too much lately had given this guy too many opportunities, allowing him to recover so quickly.\n\nAs if sensing Zhou Ze's thoughts, the brush, which had been lying in Zhou Ze's palm, suddenly flew backward and hovered above the Nether Sea. Zhou Ze narrowed his eyes slightly. What was this cursed brush going to do?\n\nThe next moment, the brush began to write, its thick blood-colored ink appearing as if out of nowhere.\n\n\"Hiss...\" Boss Zhou immediately knelt down in pain on the small boat.\n\nIn the real world, on the floor of the prison library, Zhou Ze's blood was being rapidly drawn out, making him look significantly thinner. Chest tightness, dizziness, shortness of breath. As a surgeon, Zhou Ze understood that these were typical symptoms of excessive blood loss.\n\nHe looked up at the brush above, then thought of the two people who had been controlled and consumed into puppets by it. Even being its master was not an easy task. If it continued to drain him like this, he would soon become a dried-up husk.\n\n\"Bang!\" The brush wielded its power, beginning to write in the air. The Nether Sea began to churn, because Zhou Ze and the other party shared losses, so when Zhou Ze felt weakness, the other party felt it too. The Nether Sea began to rapidly shrink, no, to be precise, it was evaporating.\n\n\"What are you... doing!\" the one beneath the sea surface asked, but no one answered. Because the brush couldn't speak, and Zhou Ze, as its new master, sorry, even his master didn't know what it was going to do! After all, it's really hard to understand the mind of a cursed brush.\n\nOne word was slowly written in the air: \"Seal!\" The seal script was still easy to recognize, as it resembled the simplified character for \"seal.\" The vigorous \"Seal\" character floated in the air, then pressed down fiercely!\n\n\"Boom!\" It was as if the depths of the Nether Sea had exploded, and the one below let out a roar, but the sound of the roar began to weaken, and eventually, the entire Nether Sea was frozen solid.\n\nA giant \"Seal\" character still hovered in the sky, but it was continuously being consumed, as the one below was constantly resisting and corroding the seal. The brush hovered above the character, occasionally adding a stroke, or erasing one, like the most steadfast guardian, holding firm to this seal.\n\n\"Sealed?\" Zhou Ze was somewhat surprised. But the brush did not respond to him. Zhou Ze could only shout into the ice: \"Hey, did the seal succeed? You damn thing, say something!\"\n\nBelow, there was dead silence. That guy, who had been acting like an arrogant noble just moments ago, was now completely silent. It seemed the seal was successful. Zhou Ze looked at his feet; his small boat was also frozen, but he could now disembark and walk on the ice.\n\n\"You will regret this...\" Suddenly, that voice came from below again. This startled Zhou Ze. Damn it, when I asked you, you played dead, and now you suddenly speak up to scare me?\n\n\"Without me... you would have died long ago.\" The voice from below became very weak. This was the truth; on several occasions, if the consciousness within him hadn't acted, Boss Zhou would have long since reported to the underworld, or perhaps his soul would have scattered, without even a chance to report. But just as the other party had boastfully threatened earlier, he had said that he only had half a year to take over. Therefore, if this sealing could truly succeed this time, Zhou Ze felt it was quite worth it.\n\n\"I will wait...\"\n\n\"Wait for what?\"\n\n\"For when you need my strength...\" Zhou Ze's gaze sharpened. \"For when you personally unseal me! Believe me, this day will not be too far off.\"\n\n\"Snap...\" Like the lights suddenly going out on a stage, the surroundings instantly turned pitch black. Zhou Ze slowly opened his eyes and found that it was already dawn outside. He curled up, trying to get up, but his body was trembling uncontrollably. Although there were no wounds, he had lost a lot of blood. Moreover, he had already gone through an internal struggle with the consciousness within him, causing his physical condition to be no better than when he was paralyzed after a rampage.\n\nHowever, sounds were already coming from outside. Dawn had broken, and someone would soon enter here. Then they would discover an outsider in the library. The subsequent events would become very troublesome.\n\nZhou Ze forced himself to stand up, and finally, he succeeded. He stood up, leaning on the table, his body still swaying. But to climb out the wall as he had entered, that was likely a pipe dream.\n\n\"So, you came to the prison library in the middle of the night to read dirty books?\" A familiar voice came from behind the bookshelf. It was Lawyer An.\n\n\"Your body is really weak right now.\" Lawyer An bent down and helped Zhou Ze. \"Fortunately, I couldn't sleep last night, so I came to check on you. Otherwise, you'd be in trouble.\"\n\nLawyer An was about to help Zhou Ze leave, but Zhou Ze's gaze was fixed on the fountain pen on the ground. The real brush was sealing the other party within him, and this fountain pen had become extremely ordinary. Lawyer An glanced at it, picked it up, and put it into Zhou Ze's pocket, patting it.\n\n\"Can we go now?\" Zhou Ze nodded weakly.",

    "content": "The car drove back to the bookstore's entrance. As Lawyer An prepared to carry Zhou Ze out of the car, Zhou Ze firmly gripped the door handle with one hand, his eyes fixed on his pen, which had rolled to the floor due to the car's bumpy motion.\n\nLawyer An was shocked.\n\nHe recalled a conversation with Old Daoist Priest earlier.\n\nOld Daoist Priest had mentioned that their boss was sometimes a bit greedy for money.\n\nThis wasn't greed for money at all; it was utter destitution!\n\nSo poor that he would sneak into a prison late at night to steal an old pen, and even in his current state, he couldn't let go of it.\n\n\"Good boy, we don't need it. I'll buy you a Parker fountain pen tomorrow.\"\n\nBut Zhou Ze still wouldn't let go.\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nLawyer An bent down and retrieved the pen, placing it in Zhou Ze's pocket and even zipping it up for him.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze release his grip.\n\nThe exertion from earlier had nearly made him faint.\n\nLawyer An remembered a story his supervisor had told him when he was on duty.\n\nIt was from the late Qing Dynasty.\n\nA ghost messenger, who was a ghost envoy at the time, went to escort a soul to hell. However, the old man refused to die.\n\nThe time specified in the Book of Life and Death was almost up, but the man wouldn't breathe his last. The ghost envoy couldn't just go and strangle a living person, could he?\n\nThe old man lay on the bed, on his deathbed, refusing to close his eyes, stubbornly holding on.\n\nHis family thought he had some unfinished business, some concerns he needed to address, and they asked him one by one.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe old man's concubine blew out an extra lamp, and only then did the old man close his eyes with satisfaction and breathe his last.\n\nThe reason was that the extra lamp was a waste of lamp oil.\n\nIn Lawyer An's opinion,\n\nZhou Ze and that old man were quite comparable.\n\nZhou Ze was carried into the bookstore by Lawyer An.\n\nFortunately,\n\nEveryone in the bookstore was used to it.\n\nIf other bosses were lazy,\n\nThey would generally stay in their offices, having secretaries handle tasks, and if there was nothing else, they would...\n\nTheir own boss,\n\nIf you call him lazy,\n\nHe was truly lazy.\n\nBut he always managed to put on a facade of immense dedication,\n\nWalking out,\n\nAnd returning lying down.\n\nPeople often say that being a criminal police officer is a high-risk profession,\n\nBut their boss's injury frequency, no, their severe injury frequency, was comparable to that of a mercenary on the battlefield.\n\nAs a result,\n\nFaced with a boss who frequently returned from severe injuries,\n\nEveryone in the bookstore had gained considerable experience.\n\nBai Yingying went to prepare a bed and change of clothes to help Zhou Ze bathe.\n\nOld Daoist Priest quickly told Monkey to urinate.\n\nThe little loli pouted and continued to sit behind the bar. Seeing Zhou Ze being carried into the bathroom by Bai Yingying, she shook her head, feeling like a jilted wife watching her husband who had spent the night out finally return home.\n\n\"Boss, can you still sit down?\"\n\nIn the bathroom, Bai Yingying asked with some concern.\n\nBefore, when helping the boss bathe, she would arrange a small stool for him to sit on while she helped clean him. But this time, the boss's condition was strange; he seemed extremely weak, though his body was bare with no visible injuries.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nHe felt dizzy,\n\nHe was short of breath,\n\nAnd his chest was tight,\n\nBut he still needed to bathe.\n\nFor someone with severe mysophobia, not bathing before going to bed while conscious was absolutely unbearable.\n\nBai Yingying was now in a dilemma.\n\nThe boss couldn't sit.\n\nDid she have to let the boss lie on the tiles for her to wash him?\n\nThe tiles were cold.\n\nOh no,\n\nIt seemed the boss wasn't afraid of the cold.\n\nBut the tiles were hard.\n\nLying on them would be uncomfortable, definitely not pleasant.\n\nYingying remembered that \"The Maid's Self-Cultivation\" seemed to contain content about bathing, something like a bubble bath, which required an air mattress.\n\nFirst, she applied shower gel to herself,\n\nThen she used her body to help the boss apply shower gel.\n\n*Whimper, whimper!*\n\nThis is so infuriating!\n\nShe forgot to buy an air mattress!\n\nThe hot water was already running in the bathroom, steaming hot. Zhou Ze felt even more uncomfortable. He wanted to remind Bai Yingying to hurry up and wash him and get him out, but then, he felt himself being lifted and placed into the bathtub.\n\nHis body was soaked in warm water, and he felt much better.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA smooth and elastic body also sat into the bathtub,\n\nAnd began to scrub his back and apply shower gel.\n\nEven in his current state of blood loss,\n\nEven though he was so weak,\n\nThis feeling,\n\nWas truly, damnably comfortable.\n\nHowever, after enjoying it for a moment,\n\nZhou Ze forced himself to speak:\n\n\"Yingying...\"\n\n\"Yes, boss. Do you need anything else?\"\n\n\"Change the water in the bathtub. It's gotten cold.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay, boss.\"\n\nThis bath was very comfortable,\n\nBut the water in the bathtub cooled down much faster than usual.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze was carried upstairs by Bai Yingying and into the bedroom.\n\nAfter lying on the bed, Zhou Ze adjusted to the height of the pillow. Old Daoist Priest came in with a bowl of soup.\n\n\"Boss, drink the soup. It's very nourishing. I've been simmering it for a long time.\"\n\n\"You made soup today?\" Bai Yingying asked, surprised.\n\nOld Daoist Priest had gone out in the morning, supposedly to help people in the old street. He had only just returned before the boss came home.\n\n\"Here, drink it, boss.\"\n\nOld Daoist Priest made a move to help Zhou Ze sit up and feed him the soup.\n\nZhou Ze frowned and asked, \"What's in the soup?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Old Daoist Priest replied, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"What exactly is in it!\"\n\n\"Monkey urine...\"\n\nOld Daoist Priest mumbled, and then explained:\n\n\"Boss, you used to heal your injuries with monkey urine mixed with mud. This time, you don't have external wounds, but you seem even weaker. So, this humble one thinks that internal consumption might be more effective than external application this time.\"\n\n\"Old Daoist Priest...\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm here.\"\n\n\"How old are you this year?\"\n\n\"Seventy-one.\"\n\n\"At your age, still working for me, it's not easy.\"\n\n\"It's my duty, my duty. Being able to work with you, boss, is my good fortune.\"\n\n\"I hope you can work for me for another ten years.\"\n\n\"No problem, no problem!\"\n\n\"Then hurry up and drink the soup to nourish yourself.\"\n\n\"...\" Old Daoist Priest.\n\n\"Boss, boss, this is for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes.\n\nOld Daoist Priest shrugged and prepared to leave with the soup.\n\nJust as he reached the door with the bowl of soup,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly said:\n\n\"Drink it.\"\n\n\"...\" Old Daoist Priest.\n\nOld Daoist Priest's face contorted into a chrysanthemum.\n\n\"Drink it.\"\n\nOld Daoist Priest nodded, dipped his lips into it, and found the taste to be astringent and sour.\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze didn't call him again,\n\nOld Daoist Priest quickly took the soup bowl and went down.\n\n\"Hehe, boss, I thought you were really going to make him drink it all.\"\n\nBai Yingying sat on the bed and propped up Zhou Ze's legs.\n\nOne could say that Old Daoist Priest meant well.\n\nZhou Ze doing this was a bit excessive.\n\nNo, no,\n\nThink about the wheelchair Old Daoist Priest bought back then.\n\nWhen he finally sat on it and drove off \"vroom vroom,\" he had a face like a liver.\n\nSo, sometimes, what goes on in that old man's mind is truly hard to understand.\n\nAs soon as Old Daoist Priest left, Xu Qinglang pushed open the door and walked in.\n\n\"What happened this time?\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nXu Qinglang sat by the bed and carefully examined Zhou Ze's condition.\n\n\"So weak?\n\nHow about this, I'll go out later and buy some pig liver, red dates, and the like to make a soup for you to nourish yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Oh, and also.\"\n\nXu Qinglang stood up and walked out, returning quickly with a gift box. He opened it and placed it on Zhou Ze's bedside table.\n\n\"Xue Er oral liquid?\"\n\nBai Yingying read the label.\n\n\"Yes, I drink some of it myself,\" Xu Qinglang said, pointing to Zhou Ze. \"You should drink some too.\"\n\n\"Isn't this something for... women... to drink?\"\n\n\"At this point, why worry about gender differences?\"\n\nAfter saying that,\n\nXu Qinglang lightly flicked Zhou Ze's forehead with his middle finger.\n\n\"You're being sentimental.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nXu Qinglang left directly, likely to go buy groceries.\n\nBai Yingying pouted and reached out to wipe Zhou Ze's forehead.\n\n\"Where's the pen?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"My pen, the fountain pen.\"\n\n\"The fountain pen?\" Yingying blinked. \"It seems to be in the bathroom.\"\n\n\"Bring it.\"\n\n\"Okay, boss.\"\n\nYingying immediately went downstairs,\n\nBut couldn't find it in the bathroom.\n\n\"Where's the pen? Where's the boss's fountain pen?\"\n\n\"This one?\"\n\nThe little loli sitting behind the bar asked, holding an old fountain pen.\n\n\"It should be.\"\n\n\"I saw it on the bathroom floor just now,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"Then that's it. The boss is waiting for it. This pen seems very important to the boss.\"\n\n\"Heh, injured like this and still asking for a pen to practice calligraphy?\n\nWhat an idiot.\"\n\nThe little loli shook her head and continued reading her comic.\n\n\"Boss, here's the fountain pen.\"\n\nBai Yingying quickly ran back to the bedroom and gave the pen to Zhou Ze.\n\nThis pen had actually lost its magical effect, because the real pen was inside her body, suppressing that person. But this one couldn't be lost; it might be useful in the future.\n\nNow, what reassured Zhou Ze the most was that the two things that posed the greatest threat to him\n\nwere currently sealing and confronting each other.\n\nThis situation,\n\nwas wonderful.\n\nYingying gently massaged the boss.\n\nAs she massaged,\n\nshe found that the boss had fallen asleep,\n\nbut even in his sleep,\n\nhis hand was still clutching the fountain pen.\n\nYingying tried to pull the fountain pen out, but the boss's hand tightly gripped it. Yingying had no choice but to cover him with a blanket.\n\nThen, she sat by the bedside, took out her phone, and went to Taobao.\n\nShe carefully selected an extra-large air mattress,\n\nOrdered it.\n\nOK,\n\nDone.\n\n\"Once the item arrives, I can look forward to the boss returning from severe injuries next time.\"\n\nImmediately after,\n\nYingying frowned, with a hint of reluctance:\n\n\"Forget it, it's better if the boss doesn't get injured.\n\nBut if the boss doesn't get injured, he won't let me help him bathe.\n\nIf he doesn't let me help him bathe, I won't get to use the air mattress.\n\nThis is so conflicted,\n\n*Sob, sob, sob.*\n\nAfter finishing her shopping, Bai Yingying lay down beside Zhou Ze, took out her newly purchased Switch from the bedside cabinet, and started playing \"Stardew Valley.\"\n\nThis was a very old farm management game. In the eyes of many, it was outdated, but for those who liked it, it was endlessly replayable.\n\nYingying had planted many crops in the game,\n\nand there was also a large pigsty.\n\nShe raised three pigs in it,\n\nrespectively named:\n\nLittle Xu,\n\nLittle Ke,\n\nLittle Qiu.\n\n————————\n\nThis is an additional chapter for three thousand monthly votes,\n\nSeeking monthly votes,\n\nSeeking more monthly votes!\n\nEveryone, don't be shy,\n\nVote,\n\nGive Lazy Fish Dragon a chance to explode!",

    "content": "Zhou Ze had a dream.\n\nThis time,\n\nIt wasn't hell,\n\nBut a simple dream,\n\nSo simple,\n\nIt was a bit monotonous.\n\nIn the dream,\n\nHe sat by a small pier made of wooden stakes.\n\nBeside him, a few aunts were washing clothes and vegetables, chatting about neighborhood gossip.\n\nBehind him,\n\nMany children were chasing each other and playing.\n\nHe held a fishing rod,\n\nCasting the bait into the river.\n\nHe himself sat quietly there, wearing a conical hat.\n\nThe weather was clear, the sun was shining brightly, but it wasn't scorching. The valley breeze blew, refreshingly comfortable.\n\nThen,\n\nThroughout the entire dream,\n\nHe just sat there,\n\nFishing,\n\nFishing,\n\nStill fishing.\n\nWhen he woke up, he still hadn't caught a single fish.\n\nAfter waking up,\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh.\n\nBeside him, Yingying was playing a game with her back to him, not yet noticing he had woken up.\n\nEyes open,\n\nStaring at the ceiling.\n\nYesterday,\n\nHe had witnessed the gap between himself and that person.\n\nOne was the Lord of the Underworld Sea,\n\nAnd he,\n\nWas merely a small boat on the Underworld Sea, liable to capsize at any moment.\n\nAnd in his dream,\n\nHe was merely sitting there fishing.\n\nHe had heard people say that dreams might show scenes from one's past life.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew he had no past life.\n\nEven if he did,\n\nIt seemed from the dream,\n\nHis past life and this life were quite similar.\n\nHe reached out and rubbed his face.\n\nBoss Zhou didn't wallow in self-pity or feel particularly pitiful or wronged.\n\nPerhaps this was related to his experiences since childhood.\n\nFor an ordinary person, well, for the vast majority of people, their lives simply followed the stages of childhood, youth, middle age, and old age.\n\nHaving past and present lives like great beings such as the Golden Cicada is, after all, extremely rare.\n\nWhen he was little in the orphanage,\n\nHaving meat to eat,\n\nAnd Sprite and Coke to drink,\n\nWas already something to be very satisfied with.\n\nEven his current state was far more relaxed and comfortable than his past self, who worked day and night, eager to seize any opportunity to climb higher.\n\nLiving in the moment,\n\nMany people talk about it,\n\nBut few truly understand it.\n\nAs he thought, Zhou Ze felt a bit tired again. There had been many things happening lately. After returning from Changzhou, other events occurred, making even a simple wish to sleep in peacefully beside Yingying a luxury.\n\nTherefore,\n\nZhou Ze didn't wake Bai Yingying.\n\nInstead, he turned his head,\n\nAnd fell back into a deep sleep.\n\nBai Yingying was still engrossed in her game, completely unaware that her boss had just woken up and fallen back asleep.\n\nWhen the game console indicated low battery, Yingying tiptoed off the bed and quickly went downstairs to get the charger before returning.\n\nShe knew she couldn't leave for too long, otherwise her boss would naturally wake up.\n\nAfter plugging in the charger, Bai Yingying didn't continue playing. Instead, she placed the game console on the bedside table, turned to the side, and looked at Zhou Ze, who was sleeping on his front.\n\nLooking at his eyelashes, his lips, his nose,\n\nMany people might wonder what's so captivating about that.\n\nPerhaps only those who have truly been in love can understand this feeling.\n\nThe bedroom door was pushed open.\n\nXu Qinglang stood at the doorway,\n\nPointing at Zhou Ze,\n\nAsking Yingying if he was awake.\n\nYingying shook her head.\n\nXu Qinglang shrugged and left. After all, the longer the medicinal broth simmered, the better its effect. He wasn't in a hurry.\n\nHe went downstairs.\n\nDeadpool was mopping the floor with a mop. The old Daoist priest was sitting behind the bar, playing chess with a monkey.\n\nYes,\n\nA monkey could learn to play chess.\n\nAnd judging by the situation, the old Daoist priest was at a disadvantage.\n\nThe little loli sat on the sofa, flipping through a comic book boredly, occasionally yawning.\n\n\"If you want to sleep, go up and sleep,\"\n\nXu Qinglang said.\n\n\"Just summer drowsiness, it's nothing serious.\"\n\nThe little loli shook her head. She still preferred to sleep at night. Although there wasn't much to do in the bookstore, she felt that even just sitting there daydreaming was more \"healthy and active\" than sleeping indiscriminately day and night.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nThis was the last stand she could make before being completely assimilated into a couch potato.\n\nLawyer An had just returned. After dropping Zhou Ze back at the bookstore, he went to the prison again. Recently, his only ongoing case was that malevolent spirit in Tongcheng Prison.\n\n\"The boss really has a good hobby, running off to scare people in the middle of the night, making them unable to even meditate.\"\n\nLawyer An complained with some helplessness.\n\nFor a malevolent spirit newly arrived in the human world, sleep and food were major troubles. Eating could be forced down; as long as one wanted to live, they couldn't let the body starve. So, no matter how disgusting or difficult, they could force themselves to eat. At most, they'd eat a little less, resulting in mild malnutrition.\n\nBut sleep was truly impossible. Even if one constantly took sleeping pills, besides paralyzing their body in bed, their consciousness would remain awake.\n\nAlso,\n\nDon't think that committing suicide with sleeping pills is beautiful.\n\nIn reality, suicide with sleeping pills is also accompanied by immense pain.\n\nBut at that moment, you can't wake up.\n\nSo, to the living, people who commit suicide with sleeping pills seem to pass away peacefully.\n\nBut imagine the torment of the sleeping pill's effects taking hold, causing immense suffering while you are unable to shout or move.\n\n\"Hey, I heard you used to be an official.\"\n\nThe little loli asked Lawyer An, looking at him.\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\nLawyer An looked at the little loli.\n\n\"Can you tell me about it?\"\n\nThe little loli reached out and patted the sofa beside her. She had her legs crossed, with a glass of iced water in front of her. It was a pity, but she was still too young.\n\nLawyer An was a bit lecherous, but this was also a common male trait. When a trait becomes common, it's no longer considered a trait.\n\nBut Lawyer An felt absolutely nothing for girls of the little loli's age. Yet, given the little loli's actual age and experiences, she always gave off a strong sense of dissonance.\n\nLike a little girl secretly using her mother's lipstick on her lips, or like a middle-aged woman wearing a school uniform, waving at you and calling out, \"Oppa, come here!\"\n\nIt was too dissonant.\n\n\"Uh, why are you asking this?\"\n\n\"Curiosity.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nLawyer An sat down opposite the little loli.\n\n\"So, what position did you reach back then?\"\n\n\"You can guess.\"\n\n\"Constable?\" The little loli shook her head. \"Should be a bit higher, like, an inspector?\"\n\n\"It's all in the past.\"\n\n\"I'm very curious, what mistake did you make back then?\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nThe little loli looked up,\n\nTowards the ceiling.\n\nThe one upstairs seemed to have made more mistakes, but nothing ever happened to him.\n\n\"I'd rather not answer that for now.\" Lawyer An stood up. \"Actually, sometimes climbing higher isn't a good thing, because only being a ghost messenger is the most carefree time.\"\n\n\"Carefree?\"\n\n\"Its synonym is lawless.\"\n\nLawyer An twisted his neck and yawned. \"I'm so envious of you, being able to crash at someone's place for sleep at night.\"\n\nLawyer An also wanted to crash at someone's place, but he feared death more.\n\nIt was easy to imagine that if he sneaked into that guy's room,\n\nThat guy would definitely get out of bed and fight him.\n\nSaying this,\n\nLawyer An stood up.\n\n\"Alright, I need to meditate, otherwise I won't be able to relieve my body's fatigue.\"\n\n\"So, you still want to get your official position back?\"\n\nThe little loli asked.\n\nLawyer An stopped, turned his head back, and looked at the little loli with the look of an idiot:\n\n\"Isn't that obvious? We've placed our bets on him. It's an 80/20 split, you idiot!\"\n\n...\n\nIn the evening, Zhou Ze woke up again. He went downstairs and took a shower. Although his body was still a bit weak, at least he had recovered well mentally.\n\nHe first drank the Red Spider Lily oral solution, then drank several bowls of medicinal broth brewed by Xu Qinglang. He felt his fingers could finally grip with some strength.\n\nThe old Daoist priest opened the shop door, removing the \"Temporarily Closed\" sign, signifying that the Midnight Bookstore had officially entered operating hours. Then, the old Daoist priest looked towards the door.\n\nNight has fallen.\n\nHe wondered how many young ladies were still sleeping alone in their empty rooms.\n\nSometimes, the old Daoist priest felt guilty. His abilities were limited, and so were the people he could help.\n\nHe took out a radio and tuned through the channels, planning to listen to a midnight program.\n\nThe radio turned on, starting with GG:\n\n\"Kidney deficiency, sometimes it occurs after excessive fatigue...\"\n\nThe evening breeze blew gently, taking away some of the heat of summer. The bustling South Street of the day finally quieted down.\n\nThe little loli went to the second floor because Wang Ke had called. She specifically went to the second floor to take the call. She didn't want outsiders to hear the conversation between father and daughter.\n\nXu Qinglang sat in a private room, the kind specifically for the deceased on their journey to the afterlife. He had a face mask on and a cup of his homemade rice wine beside him.\n\nSmelling the faint aroma of wine, wearing a face mask.\n\nDeadpool sat at the doorway. Since the shop door was wide open, insects would occasionally fly in.\n\nAny insect that flew in was lightning-fast caught and swallowed by Deadpool's tongue. He had an expression of ecstasy and satisfaction.\n\nLawyer An, naked, sat cross-legged on the bed in his second-floor room, entering a meditative state to relax his muscles and relieve fatigue.\n\nOpposite him was the still-unconscious Old Zhang. Old Zhang had woken up a few times, but each time he woke up, he immediately fell back into a coma. According to Lawyer An, Old Zhang's soul was too weak, so it would take more days to adapt to the new body. However, the problem was no longer significant.\n\nIt was estimated that he should wake up completely tomorrow.\n\nThen,\n\nOfficer Zhang, who Boss Zhou had been careful to protect his worldview,\n\nMight...\n\nThe little monkey sat on the balcony of the second floor,\n\nGazing at the moon in the sky.\n\nThe crescent moon was curved,\n\nSilver-gray light sprinkled on the little monkey,\n\nLike a monkey sculpture.\n\nBeside it,\n\nLay a small toy hammer bought by the old Daoist priest.\n\nThe old Daoist priest had wanted to buy it a toy Ruyi Jingu Bang,\n\nBut the little monkey preferred its small hammer.\n\nBai Yingying made tea for Zhou Ze and brought it over, with goji berries added to the tea.\n\nThen she sat beside Zhou Ze, holding a palm-leaf fan, gently fanning him.\n\nBoss Zhou leaned back in the rattan chair behind the bar.\n\nHe occasionally got up to take a sip of tea.\n\nMost of the time, he just gently swayed in the rattan chair.\n\nSwaying,\n\nSwaying,\n\nSwaying...",

He first glanced back at the busy people inside the bookstore, then walked out.\n\nThe Death Warrior rarely went out. For him, going out or not going out held no great significance, and this time, though he went out, he didn't go far.\n\nHe just went across the street to the…\nInternet cafe.\n\nHe walked, one hand on the wall,\nslowly ascending the stairs,\nhis nose twitching as he sniffed.\nHe seemed a little lost, and a little intoxicated.\n\nThanks to the bookstore, his attire was normal. So, although his ascent up the stairs was a bit slow and clumsy, the people passing by didn't find anything unusual.\nAt most, they'd jest, \"Still coming online even when sick? So inspirational.\"\n\nThe Death Warrior didn't stay on the second floor but went straight to the third.\nThe third-floor door was locked. The area below was the internet cafe's operational zone; this was the living quarters.\n\nThe Death Warrior bent down,\ninnocently trying to peek inside through the keyhole.\nOf course, he couldn't see anything,\nbut he still pressed his nose against the edge of the door's gap and sniffed hard.\nHe opened his mouth,\nand licked his tongue.\n\nHe wanted to open the door,\nbut it was a high-quality anti-theft door.\nHe also didn't have the same kind of thief-suited fingernails as his boss.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation,\nhe didn't choose to return the way he came.\nInstead, he climbed out through the ventilation window at the corner of the stairwell.\n\nIt was late at night,\nand there weren't many people on the street.\nLike a gecko, he crawled along the wall.\nThough his speed was slow, it was steady.\n\nHe arrived at a window.\nThe window wasn't locked and was even open.\nAfter entering through the window, the Death Warrior sniffed again, his saliva beginning to drip.\n\nHe pulled aside the curtain, revealing rows of glass and ceramic jars, filled with all sorts of Gu worms crawling around.\nThe Death Warrior, like a child entering a candy store after it had closed and everyone had left,\nbegan to feast.\nTo him, those terrifying Gu worms were like alluring jellybeans,\nchewing them with a\nsatisfying crunch.\n\nThen, he took a centipede in his hand, as if eating a Snickers bar, becoming more excited and unable to stop the more he ate.\nJust then, the door was pushed open.\n\nQu Mingming walked in,\nstretched,\nand then,\nhe froze.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\nQu Mingming shouted. Immediately after, he saw the large empty, opened jars and his heart sank, then began to bleed.\nThese Gu worms were cultivated over immense effort and cost. Just as some people liked collecting luxury cars, and others liked collecting figurines, he liked collecting Gu worms.\nThese were his life's work,\nhis treasures,\nhis sanctuary for late-night contemplation and self-gratification!\n\nWith a \"slurp,\"\na lizard-like reptile was slurped into his mouth, like he was eating a strand of spaghetti.\n\nThe Death Warrior was somewhat bewildered,\nand even offered a worm in his hand to Qu Mingming,\nas if to say,\n\"Want some too?\"\n\nQu Mingming became enraged,\nthen took out his phone,\nand dialed his sister.\n\nSoon,\nQu Zhenzhen came upstairs.\nSimilarly,\nupon seeing the Death Warrior eating worms there, she was utterly shocked.\n\nBecause the Death Warrior had recently changed his physical form, and he basically never left the bookstore, plus the Qu siblings hadn't had much contact with the bookstore recently, they didn't know the Death Warrior's identity.\nHowever, seeing this guy feasting on worms there,\nand still acting like nothing was wrong,\neven a fool would know this person was not simple.\n\n\"Zhenzhen, go and subdue him,\" Qu Mingming said.\nQu Zhenzhen nodded, stepped forward, and one by one, worms began to emerge from her ears, crawling towards the back of her head. The insects' mouths began to pierce the back of her skull.\nQu Zhenzhen's body started to tremble, her muscles bulged, and her breathing became stronger.\nThis was a method of stimulating the body's potential.\n\nBut when the Death Warrior, still eating worms, saw Qu Zhenzhen's transformation,\nhe wasn't scared.\nInstead, he actively walked over.\nOne person,\ncovered in and filled with worms,\nwas like a skewer of candied hawthorns stuck into a scarecrow!\nThis temptation,\nthe Death Warrior truly couldn't resist.\n\nQu Zhenzhen lunged forward. Qu Mingming stood behind her. He didn't immediately rush to fight the Death Warrior because he was calm.\nHe wasn't skilled in combat, nor did he know any martial arts. As for his sister, because she was quite frail as a child, their family had her train in martial arts from a young age. Although this didn't prevent her from experiencing illness episodes, ever since he used Gu cultivation to extend her life, to a certain extent, her potential had broken through the limits understandable by ordinary people.\nOf course, these limits,\ncouldn't compare to those perverted individuals in the bookstore across the street.\n\n\"Bang!\"\nQu Zhenzhen knocked the Death Warrior to the ground in one encounter, her knee pressing firmly against his neck, her hands gripping his shoulders, dislocating his arms.\n\nThe Death Warrior was pinned beneath her,\nbut he didn't feel pain,\nnor did he feel insulted.\nOn the contrary,\nhe was still grinning foolishly at Qu Zhenzhen.\nIn his eyes,\na delicious girl and a beautiful girl in the eyes of ordinary people were\nno different.\n\n\"Dislocate his shoulders.\"\nQu Mingming walked over.\nAt this moment, while he felt heartache for his worms, he wasn't blinded by it. As a doctor, especially a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, he must have cultivated the arts of self-cultivation and temperance thoroughly.\nQu Zhenzhen grabbed one of the Death Warrior's shoulders with one hand and reached for the other to dislocate his joints.\nWith two \"cracking\" sounds,\nthe Death Warrior's arms were dislocated,\ndrooping limply to his sides.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\nQu Mingming squatted down beside him and asked.\nThe Death Warrior didn't answer. He just smacked his lips. He wanted to eat, to eat worms. The worms here were so delicious.\nQu Zhenzhen glanced at her brother and made a throat-slitting gesture.\nBack then, due to an argument, Qu Zhenzhen had released worms onto the person, intending to take their life. If Zhou Ze hadn't intervened, that venomous woman might have already died.\nMoreover,\nit's hard to expect someone with insects constantly crawling on and in their body\nto value human life\nthat highly.\n\nQu Mingming shook his head. A doctor's heart is like a parent's. He was unwilling to take a life casually.\nBut this guy ate so many highly toxic Gu worms and acted as if nothing happened, so he was definitely not just some random lunatic.\nHow should he be handled?\n\nJust then,\nthe Death Warrior suddenly broke free from Qu Zhenzhen's restraint.\nQu Zhenzhen, who had assumed the Death Warrior was incapacitated after his arm joints were dislocated, had relaxed her guard.\nIn an instant,\nQu Zhenzhen was flipped onto the ground by the Death Warrior.\nHis previously limp arms instantly returned to normal. His hands pinned Qu Zhenzhen's arms, his tongue extended, probing into Qu Zhenzhen's ear and starting to eat the worms within.\n\nQu Mingming froze for a moment,\nthen immediately reached out to pull the Death Warrior off, but the Death Warrior remained unmoved.\nHe had eaten so many worms today, it was incredibly satisfying,\nlike a starving peasant suddenly invited to a feast of imperial delicacies, he couldn't stop himself.\n\n\"Kill him, Zhenzhen!\"\nAt this point, Qu Mingming no longer dared to show any misplaced kindness.\nQu Mingming let out a low roar, exerted force at his waist, kicking the Death Warrior away, then lunged forward, grabbed him by the neck, and his legs climbed up like two water snakes, directly twisting off the Death Warrior's neck.\n\nThe Death Warrior's entire body went limp and he fell backward,\ncrashing heavily onto the ground.\nBut Qu Mingming was shocked to discover\nthat the Death Warrior's hands were still trembling!\nHe,\nwasn't dead yet!\n\nQu Mingming got up, quickly went to the cabinet to grab alcohol, and poured it directly onto the Death Warrior, then took out a lighter. He intended to destroy the evidence right there at home.\n\n\"Close the window,\" Qu Mingming called to his sister.\nQu Zhenzhen immediately went to close the window. At this moment, she noticed the old Taoist from the bookstore opposite emerge, as if he had lost his pet and was calling its name.\nHe lit the lighter and threw it directly onto the Death Warrior.\nFlames instantly erupted.\n\nQu Mingming hadn't expected to become this frenzied one day, burning someone in his own home.\nOf course,\nhe also knew,\nthat the person before him,\nwas definitely not a normal living person in the strict sense.\nHowever,\njust as the flames began to rise,\nthe Death Warrior, with his neck twisted and his face turned backward, suddenly opened his eyes.\nHis hands began forming hand seals in a bizarre manner,\nand he uttered incomprehensible syllables in his mouth.\nHis movements were extremely fast,\nvery skilled.\nA gust of cold wind blew.\nThe problem was, the window had just been closed, and the door was also closed. Where was the wind coming from?\nBut the wind did come,\nand it immediately extinguished the fire right after it started. The solid alcohol on the Death Warrior hadn't even had time to fully ignite.\n\nThe Death Warrior slowly stood up.\nHe was facing the Qu siblings directly, but his face was still at the back.\nHe raised his hands,\ngrabbed his head,\nand with a series of \"crunching\" sounds of bone friction,\nthe Death Warrior finally managed to straighten his head.\n\nHowever,\nthe Death Warrior didn't attack Qu Zhenzhen,\nnor did he rush to eat worms.\nInstead, he preoccupied himself with continuously changing hand seals.\nHe was somewhat confused.\nWhat was it that he had just created?\nIt seemed very powerful.\nBut why couldn't he remember it now?\n\nHe scratched his head,\nand felt a bit annoyed with himself.\nHe simply sat down,\nand continued to form hand seals,\ncompletely ignoring the Qu siblings who were on high alert beside him.\n\nHe kept forming hand seals,\nbut couldn't replicate his previous performance.\nThis made him increasingly anxious.\nIn his anxiety,\nhe actually started to curse:\n\"Baka!\"\n\nThen,\nthe Death Warrior froze again.\nWhat does \"Baka\" mean?\nWhy did I say that?\nWhat's wrong with me today?\nI'm so strange.\nI'm so mad!",

    "content": "Here, Deadpool was constantly falling into a serious \"self-doubt,\" while on the other side, after seeing off that old aunt, everyone in the bookstore just went to bed.\n\nFrom top to bottom, not a single person noticed Deadpool was gone, not even the old Taoist who shared a room with him. This was because Deadpool had very little presence in the bookstore.\n\nThis put the siblings Qu Mingming and Qu Zhenzhen in a difficult spot. They couldn't call the police for this kind of thing, as it might lead to a lot of unnecessary trouble. Besides, raising Gu worms in a densely populated urban area was also something that couldn't be made public.\n\nBut the problem was, this guy was unkillable. If his arm was dislocated, he could recover quickly. Even if his neck was twisted the wrong way, they could still force it back.\n\nFortunately, his aggression wasn't very pronounced. After breaking in, he had only been stealing and eating the worms. Even after Qu Zhenzhen injured him and prepared to kill him, he didn't rush to retaliate after recovering.\n\nHowever, having such a guy staying in their house was still an issue. For Qu Mingming, it was no longer about worrying about the loss of his Gu worms; it was about quickly getting rid of this harbinger of misfortune.\n\nSuddenly, Qu Mingming, feeling somewhat at a loss, turned his gaze across the street. \"Let's go to the bookstore and ask for help,\" he said to his sister.\n\n\"This...\" Although very unwilling and resistant in his heart, Qu Zhenzhen knew this was the only way now. The reason for their resistance and unwillingness wasn't because the siblings had any prejudice against the bookstore. Firstly, everyone in the bookstore was too terrifying; secondly, they felt a sense of guilt towards the bookstore from the last incident. Asking for help at this time felt truly shameless.\n\nBut, they had to be shameless.\n\nQu Zhenzhen opened the window and jumped down, then ran quickly across the street to the bookstore. The door was locked, so Qu Zhenzhen could only knock. After a while, the old Taoist, wearing a white robe and having just showered, came over wiping his hair and opened the door.\n\n\"Oh, the internet café girl from across the street.\" Although the siblings Qu had a sense of guilt towards the bookstore, after all, on that night, Qu Zhenzhen was controlled by the old man beforehand, and under the old man's threats, he chose to protect himself and not sacrifice himself to pass information to the bookstore. However, from the bookstore's perspective, none of that mattered. In that environment, facing an old man of that caliber, only Boss Zhou, after going berserk, could match him; everyone else was just fodder. It's unrealistic to expect someone you met by chance to sacrifice themselves for you.\n\n\"There's a monster in our house, please help us,\" Qu Zhenzhen pleaded, lowering his head.\n\n\"A monster?\" The old Taoist scratched his head. At this moment, the old Taoist humbly refrained from boasting about his glorious deeds of fighting a certain demon five hundred years ago. Instead, he stroked his chin and pondered.\n\n\"Wait a moment, I'll go get someone for you.\"\n\n\"Aren't you... aren't you going?\" Qu Zhenzhen was taken aback. In her perception, the old Taoist was an otherworldly expert. He was one of the few living people in the bookstore. To be precise, when Qu Zhenzhen had come to the bookstore to try and figure out their secrets, Old Xu had also been poisoned and was almost turned into a zombie. At that time, the only living person in the bookstore was the old Taoist. And during that trial, by a twist of fate, the old Taoist left a deep impression on Qu Zhenzhen's heart.\n\n\"Hmm... should I go?\" The old Taoist continued to stroke his chin. Having seen many women, the old Taoist could naturally see a trace of admiration and reverence in Qu Zhenzhen's eyes, though he didn't know where this admiration and reverence came from. But the old Taoist consistently adhered to a cautious approach, just like when he helped those wayward young ladies, he always wanted to help more, but often found himself unable to, and thus had to retreat home. People need to have some self-awareness.\n\n\"This minor character isn't worth this old Taoist's attention. I'll go find a disciple... cough, a beast under my command, to help you deal with that monster.\"\n\n\"A beast under your command?\" A clear, cold voice came from behind the old Taoist. The old Taoist's body stiffened abruptly. He turned his head and saw the little萝莉 standing behind the bar.\n\n\"You, you... aren't you going up to sleep?\" the old Taoist asked in surprise. Earlier, the boss and Yingying had gone into the bedroom, and the little萝莉 had also gone to sleep after showering.\n\n\"I was a bit thirsty, so I came down to get a glass of water.\" The little萝莉 stared at the old Taoist as he walked closer, asking, \"Who did you just say was your beast under command?\"\n\n\"It's Deadpool, it's Deadpool, hahahaha!!!!\" The old Taoist burst into laughter. The little萝莉 ignored the old Taoist and turned to Qu Zhenzhen, \"A monster?\"\n\n\"Yes, a monster, an unkillable monster,\" Qu Zhenzhen said.\n\n\"Unkillable?\" The little萝莉 frowned slightly, as if recalling something, and asked, \"Where did Deadpool go?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" The old Taoist also slightly blinked. That's right, he hadn't seen Deadpool just now. It wasn't surprising that everyone paid so little attention to Deadpool's existence. Would you constantly keep track of where your mosquito repellent coil is?\n\nThe little萝莉 looked again at the internet café across the street and smiled, \"You go.\" The old Taoist scratched his head and agreed. It seemed that the unkillable monster was most likely Deadpool, who wasn't at home. This troublesome kid, why did he run out without a word? Your dad doesn't care, and neither do the little mothers around your dad.\n\nThe old Taoist intended to follow immediately, but then decided to ask Qu Zhenzhen to wait a moment and went in to change into his formal Taoist robe. Wearing cloud-walking boots, carrying a peach wood sword on his back, a Bagua mirror hanging on his chest, and a heavenly-canopy hat on his head, if a suitable, rousing background music were added, it would be the perfect movie protagonist entrance.\n\nThe little萝莉 took a sip of water behind the bar, indifferently watching the old Taoist strike a pose at the internet café girl at the door. She really wanted to remind the old Taoist that in general ghost movies, the powerful Taoist priests or monks are often depicted as scruffy, making people feel they are very powerful and hard to kill. Whereas those dressed like a bride going to get married, whether Taoist priests or monks, are often cannon fodder used to test the depth of the demons' power. A grand entrance usually leads to a tragic end, which is basically their fate.\n\n\"Young lady, lead the way. Exorcising demons and eliminating evil is the undeniable responsibility of us righteous individuals! We cultivators, why should we fear a battle!!!\"\n\n\"Uh... okay.\" Qu Zhenzhen immediately went to lead the way, although the way was very short, as it was just across the street.\n\nLed by Qu Zhenzhen, they pushed open the door to the third floor. The old Taoist standing behind them silently took out a talisman from his waistband. Just in case, just in case. Although it was highly likely that Deadpool was causing trouble here, what if it wasn't Deadpool? The old Taoist knew that his Bagua mirror and all his gear were bought from Pinduoduo. If they actually worked, that would be the most shocking thing! So, no matter what happened, at least this talisman could hold them off for a bit. Anyway, the boss and the others were right across the street. He could just shout, and reinforcements would arrive immediately.\n\nThe door was pushed open, and Qu Zhenzhen was stunned. The old Taoist, however, looked delighted. The old Taoist was delighted because, \"Wahahaha! It really is Deadpool! My roommate!\" He wasn't afraid anymore.\n\nQu Zhenzhen was shocked because her own brother was sitting with Deadpool, constantly selecting Gu worms and feeding them to Deadpool. Her brother was even smiling.\n\n\"Brother?\" Qu Zhenzhen called out. Qu Mingming looked up and saw his sister and the old Taoist behind her.\n\n\"What devil dares to wreak havoc on the human world? Eat my old Sun's... eat this old Taoist's sword!\" The old Taoist pointed his peach wood sword directly at Deadpool. Deadpool sat there blankly, watching the old Taoist's peach wood sword press against his stomach. He recognized the old Taoist and, upon seeing him, even grinned and prepared to stand up. The old Taoist immediately stepped forward, grabbed Deadpool by the neck, and then forcefully pulled Deadpool backward. Deadpool thought the old Taoist was playing a game with him and didn't resist, allowing himself to be dragged backward.\n\n\"The devil has been subdued by this old Taoist!!!\" the old Taoist roared. Damn, this felt so good! Especially with an audience, it felt great! Of course, the best part was that the devil was his roommate! The old Taoist had always had a heart to achieve enlightenment, but not the destiny for it, so he could only get his kicks this way. Well, it was very convenient for him to eliminate demons and uphold justice, as there were plenty of demons and heretics in the bookstore for him to fight. But the problem was, he didn't dare.\n\n\"This devil needs this old Taoist to take him back for refinement. Ordinary implements cannot kill him. This old Taoist shall take his leave first!\" With that, the old Taoist pulled Deadpool and walked outside.\n\n\"Taoist priest, wait!\" Qu Zhenzhen called out to the old Taoist, \"Labor fee.\"\n\n\"Oh, no need. Eliminating demons and upholding justice is this monk's... oh no, this Taoist's responsibility. It's not good to accept money. Of course, if you really want to, you can go to the bookstore tomorrow morning and buy a few carloads of books as incense money. Also, don't see me off, it's not far, not far.\" The old Taoist pulled Deadpool and hurried home.\n\nAfter leaving the internet café, the old Taoist kept tapping Deadpool's head: \"You've gotten bold, running out of the house by yourself. I'm telling you, there are many human traffickers out there now. Be careful not to be trafficked to a mountain village to become a live-in son-in-law. You'll end up like your dad, useless.\"\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!\" The old Taoist trembled, as the boss was not sleeping in bed with Yingying in the middle of the night, but was standing at the bookstore entrance.\n\n\"Boss, why aren't you sleeping?\"\n\n\"Came down for a smoke. Lin Ke said Deadpool ran out, so I came to take a look.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's okay, Boss, I brought him back.\" Deadpool looked at Zhou Ze and started to smile foolishly. Among everyone in the bookstore, he was closest to Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze reached out and patted Deadpool's head, smiling, \"Go back and rest. Next time, you're not allowed to leave the bookstore's vicinity without my permission.\" Deadpool nodded obediently and went upstairs.\n\nThe old Taoist also took the opportunity to sneak into the bookstore, but soon, Zhou Ze's voice sounded: \"I heard...\"\n\n\"Boss, the creation of a hygienic city has been successful! This old Taoist specifically watched the news!!!\" the old Taoist reported immediately.\n\n\"Oh, I wasn't talking about that. Looking at yesterday's newspaper, it seems they're creating a civilized city again.\"\n\n\"Civilized city?\" The old Taoist had a bad premonition. \"What does creating a civilized city involve?\"\n\n\"It still involves cleaning up the environment, I suppose.\"",

    "content": "Upon waking, I took a shower,\n\nthen sat in my most familiar spot where the sun shone.\n\nThe rich coffee,\n\nthe freshly ironed newspaper,\n\neven the carefully arranged flowers on the coffee table were so vibrant.\n\nAnother day of being a \"salted fish\"¹ had begun!\n\nI took a sip of coffee,\n\nshook the newspaper,\n\nand as Boss Zhou felt the \"salted fish power\"² brewing within him, Lawyer An walked over.\n\nBowing towards Zhou Ze, he said,\n\n\"Boss, can you come with me to see a client in prison?\"\n\n\"Didn't we just see them the day before yesterday?\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nI specifically climbed over the wall to see them the day before yesterday.\n\nThey should be able to feel the meticulous care I have for my customers.\n\n\"This time is different. The procedures are entering the next stage. I need to hear his requirements for his new identity, and also subtly inquire about where he plans to stay after he gets out. Once this step is completed, the remaining substantial payment can be settled.\"\n\n\"Then you go ahead.\"\n\nThe sun had just risen,\n\nand Zhou Ze was comfortably basking in it.\n\nHe really didn't want to move.\n\n\"You should come with me. I might be developing more businesses soon and need to interact with people from the underworld. If you come with me, you can also grasp a few channels of communication with the underworld, which will be more convenient for future matters.\"\n\nSince it had come to this,\n\nZhou Ze could only reluctantly close the newspaper,\n\nstand up,\n\nand accompany Lawyer An out.\n\nAfter the car parked at the entrance drove away,\n\nBai Yingying and the old Taoist stood at the door, peeking out.\n\n\"Yingyingying, has the boss left?\"\n\n\"He's left, he's left.\"\n\n\"Then let's start preparing. I don't know how long Lawyer An can hold him off.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, there's enough time.\"\n\n\"Hey, someone come and help me,\" Xu Qinglang shouted from the top of the stairs.\n\n\"This poor Taoist and Yingying are both busy,\" the old Taoist said, glancing at the little loli sitting motionlessly behind the bar.\n\nThe little loli clapped her hands,\n\n\"You guys do your thing, don't involve me. I'm just a little girl with small arms and legs, I can't help much.\"\n\n\"It's fine, you can just push from behind.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed at the little loli,\n\n\"Come up, I need to borrow your tongue. My electric whisk is broken at home.\"\n\nThe little loli smacked the bar with dissatisfaction,\n\nbut still stomped up indignantly.\n\n...\n\nArriving at the prison,\n\nZhou Ze and Lawyer An visited the inmate together.\n\nUpon seeing Zhou Ze, the prisoner shivered uncontrollably,\n\nterrified beyond measure.\n\nHis face was haggard, and he looked like he was about to waste away.\n\n\"It's okay, it's okay, don't be afraid. I've already bribed him. He's a parasite within the police force now.\"\n\nLawyer An quickly comforted him.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I still think 'Umbrella'¹ sounds better,\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't help but remind him.\n\nThe prisoner shook his head and said into the microphone, \"It's not that. You already told me about this gentleman's business last time.\"\n\n\"Then how did you end up like this? Is the torment in prison that severe?\"\n\nLawyer An felt a little guilty.\n\nAfter all, he was the one who arranged the \"rape\"² charge for the prisoner, aiming to train him, to temper his temper. But looking at him now, it seemed like he had been over-processed.\n\nThe prisoner shook his head again, saying, \"Someone in our cell just died. The guy who slept opposite me.\"\n\nLawyer An's eyes widened, and he immediately questioned, \"Did you kill him?\"\n\nHad he finally broken out after being bullied and started to fight back?\n\nThen this deal would be a bust.\n\n\"It wasn't me, how could it have been me? If I kill someone now, wouldn't all the suffering I've endured so far be in vain?\" the prisoner exclaimed emotionally.\n\n\"Was it a natural death?\" Lawyer An asked.\n\n\"Kind of... kind of.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'kind of'?\"\n\n\"He died in his sleep. I was meditating at the time,\" the prisoner recalled the scene that night, describing, \"Because my meditation wasn't going well, any slight noise nearby would interrupt my meditative state.\n\nThat night,\n\nI remember that guy suddenly started talking in his sleep,\n\nmuttering something like 'Don't chase me, don't chase me...'\n\nThen he stopped.\n\nWhen everyone got up for morning exercises the next day, they found he hadn't gotten up to wash. Our cell boss went to call him and discovered he was curled up there, lifeless.\"\n\n\"He probably had heart disease or some other hereditary condition,\" Zhou Ze, who was also listening through the microphone, interjected.\n\n\"What's the big deal? In crowded places like schools and prisons, it's normal for someone to die.\"\n\n\"But I still have a bad feeling,\" the prisoner said worriedly.\n\n\"You've already died once, are you afraid of dying again?\"\n\n\"I seem to have heard recently that someone in another cell also died in their sleep. They said it was due to heart disease, but who knows.\"\n\n\"You don't sleep anyway. Alright, sign this letter of intent. Transfer the remaining payment to me first, so I can arrange the next job for you.\n\nAfterward, I'll try to get your sentence reduced. In short, you won't have to stay here much longer.\"\n\n\"I hope it's as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I hope so too.\"\n\nAfter the conversation ended, Zhou Ze and Lawyer An went to the smoking area to have a smoke.\n\n\"What do you think?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Think about what?\" Lawyer An took out a thick wad of ghost money from his wallet, which was the final payment they had just received. \"Should I transfer this directly to your company account when I get back to the bookstore?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nWith people coming and going in the smoking room,\n\nstanding there like two grown men counting ghost money might make people think they were two idiots.\n\n\"Oh, about that thing about the person dying in their dream?\" Lawyer An chuckled. \"This rundown prison doesn't have that many strange happenings.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lawyer An paused. Huh, had anything happened here before?\n\n\"It's not necessarily true. After all, he's an evil spirit, so his perception might indeed be much stronger than that of ordinary people.\"\n\n\"Killing in dreams?\"\n\nLawyer An exaggeratedly waved his arms and laughed,\n\n\"Roar, I am Freddy Krueger!\n\nNone of you sleep, because in dreams, it's my domain. I'm going to kill you, in your dreams!\"\n\nAfter his performance, Lawyer An clutched his stomach and continued to laugh,\n\n\"Hahaha, you've watched too many *Nightmare on Elm Street* movies.\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged. Lawyer An had a point: in this small prison, where would so many strange things come from?\n\nThe issue with the pen had already been resolved. Even if they wanted to cause trouble again, they would have to find another place.\n\nAs they left the prison, Lawyer An said he wanted to buy some seafood at the beach and actually drove Zhou Ze directly to Rugao.\n\nTongcheng is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River and also by the sea, so it has rich aquatic resources. Moreover, the prices are cheaper and the seafood is fresher compared to inland areas.\n\nLawyer An selected quite a few items, packed them into the trunk, and then drove Zhou Ze back.\n\nThis excursion,\n\nit was already six o'clock in the evening by the time they returned to the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze felt a little dejected,\n\nhis leisurely day had been wasted like this.\n\nGetting out of the car,\n\nZhou Ze noticed the bookstore hadn't opened yet, even though it was already past the usual opening hours for the evening, and the lights inside were not even on.\n\nPushing the door open,\n\nhe walked inside.\n\n\"Yingying? Old Taoist?\"\n\nZhou Ze called out a few times, but there was no answer.\n\nAs he walked a few steps further inside,\n\nsuddenly,\n\nall the lights turned on.\n\nThe room was festively decorated with streamers and balloons, and a small monkey quickly moved on the ceiling, pulling open a ribbon.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nthe spherical object above was opened,\n\nfilled with bright red RMB banknotes, which then rained down.\n\nUnder the lights,\n\nbanknotes fluttered, carrying an alluring scent.\n\n\"Boss! Happy birthday!!!\"\n\nThe old Taoist, Bai Yingying, and the little loli stood up from behind the bar and shouted loudly.\n\n\"Happy birthday.\"\n\nLawyer An, who entered last, leaned against the doorframe and applauded. He had only been at the bookstore for a short time and didn't have much affection for Zhou Ze, but since he had been asked beforehand to give Zhou Ze a surprise birthday celebration, he naturally had no reason to refuse. Therefore, his task for the day was to keep Zhou Ze out and occupy his entire day, giving the others in the bookstore time to prepare.\n\nHowever,\n\nthese fluttering RMB banknotes,\n\nwere really vulgar.\n\nLawyer An thought to himself,\n\nwho would like such a vulgar scene?\n\nThen,\n\nhe froze,\n\nbecause he saw his boss closing his eyes,\n\nenjoying the feeling of being enveloped in banknotes,\n\nlost in bliss,\n\nunable to extricate himself.\n\nAlright,\n\nhe took back his earlier thoughts.\n\n\"Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you...\"\n\nIn the distance,\n\nXu Qinglang pushed out a cake trolley.\n\nThis was the large birthday cake he had personally made today,\n\nbut it only had one candle.\n\n\"Today is my birthday?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to himself and asked.\n\nHe didn't even know what his own birthday was.\n\nWhen he was in the orphanage, everyone had a collective birthday on Children's Day, June 1st.\n\nBecause the principal wanted to save money, and according to regulations, events and photos had to be arranged for Children's Day, they simply scheduled everyone's birthday collectively on June 1st.\n\nAfter leaving the orphanage, Zhou Ze hadn't celebrated his birthday anymore.\n\n\"Boss, it was on this day last year that you were reborn. Today marks exactly one year.\"\n\nBai Yingying explained.\n\nHmm,\n\nis that how it's calculated?\n\nThinking about it,\n\nit did seem quite fitting.\n\nBirthday, that was indeed the meaning.\n\nThe celebration continued until late at night. Fortunately, no customers came that night, so everyone could have a good time.\n\nAfter midnight, everyone went upstairs to rest.\n\nLying in bed,\n\nBai Yingying leaned obediently beside Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze reached out his hand to the side of the bed.\n\nBai Yingying understood,\n\nand lay down on Zhou Ze's arm, allowing him to hold her.\n\n\"Was it your idea?\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Boss, it's me who should be thanking you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nYou serve me every day, attend to me, help me bathe, and sleep with me. In the end, I still have to thank you?\n\n\"Two hundred years,\" Bai Yingying held up her finger and made a \"two\" gesture. \"Yingying lay in a coffin for two hundred years. It was really stuffy, really stuffy.\n\nWhen animals emerge from their eggs, they instinctively feel a sense of closeness to the first creature they see.\n\nAnd for me,\n\nafter emerging from the coffin,\n\nthe first living person I saw upon waking up\n\nwas you, Boss.\"\n\nOutside the door,\n\nthe little loli, having just taken a bath and preparing to sneak in for a sleep, didn't rush in.\n\nSince that silly and cute zombie had worked so hard to throw a birthday party for the boss,\n\nthere was no need for her to go in so early and disturb their cleanup work.\n\nHowever,\n\nlistening to Bai Yingying's sweet talk,\n\na meaningful smile appeared on the little loli's lips.\n\nShe thought to herself:\n\nIt's not just because the first person she saw upon waking was Zhou Ze, is it?\n\nThere's also Zhou Ze's fingernails and the aura of a high-level zombie on him.\n\nThe charm of same-species bloodline suppression, plus being the first living person seen after two hundred years of loneliness,\n\nthe combination of these two effects,\n\ntsk tsk...\n\nIt's enough to make one excitedly shed tears and shout \"Daddy\"!\n\n...\n\nToday is also Little Long's 25th birthday.\n\n---\n¹ **Salted fish (鹹魚 - xián yú)**: In modern Chinese slang, this refers to someone who has given up on ambition and is content with a lazy, unmotivated life.\n\n² **Rape (強間 - qiáng jiān)**: This is a direct and literal translation of the Chinese term, which in this context refers to a type of sexual assault.

    "content": "Disoriented,\n\nHe felt a stinging sensation all over his body,\n\nAs if needles,\n\nFrom his head to his toes, were constantly stimulating him. Every movement was like decaying, aging machinery being forcefully restarted,\n\nDry,\n\nUncomfortable.\n\nHe opened his eyes,\n\nHis vision was blurry.\n\nHe mumbled a few words with his lips,\n\nHis mouth was so dry,\n\nHe really wanted water.\n\nHis gaze swept to the bedside table, searching for a potential water source.\n\nWater,\n\nThere was water,\n\nThere was a teacup there.\n\nHe reached out his hand, picked up the teacup, and as he lifted it,\n\nHe felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\nThe teacup slipped from his grasp,\n\nAnd fell.\n\n\"Plop...\"\n\nThe teacup hit the floor, and he rolled off the bed.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nIt hurt so much...\n\nOfficer Zhang's eyes rolled back in pain, but he managed to push himself up. The pain in his body was slowly subsiding, as if he had overcome the initial phase.\n\nWhere was this?\n\nIt wasn't a hospital,\n\nNor was it home.\n\nIt didn't look like a hotel either.\n\nWhere,\n\nExactly,\n\nWas this place?\n\nOr perhaps,\n\nWas this a dream?\n\nHis head hurt so much...\n\n\"Scrape, scrape, scrape...\"\n\nOutside the door,\n\nFootsteps could be heard.\n\nOfficer Zhang instinctively grabbed the cup on the floor,\n\nAnd held it in his hand.\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nThe door was opened.\n\nThe old Daoist¹ priest walked in, muttering as he entered, \"Damn lawyer, always bossing people around, even asking this humble priest to fetch contracts for him.\n\n'Still talking about reforming the bookshop, no freeloaders, damn it, isn't the biggest freeloader in the bookshop the one who always sits there basking in the sun...'\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA \"whoosh\" sound was heard,\n\nThe cup flew and hit the old Daoist priest's face.\n\n\"Ah!!!\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest immediately clutched his face and squatted down,\n\nIt hurt,\n\nIt hurt so much,\n\nHe was disfigured!\n\nThis humble priest hasn't even married yet!!!\n\nIn reality, Officer Zhang didn't have much strength at the moment. If he had enough strength, he wouldn't have thrown it, he would have charged forward and smashed it. Moreover, even with the throw, the force wasn't that great.\n\nBut the problem was, the face is a very fragile area. Even a slight force hitting it would cause a lot of pain, especially if it touched the tip of the nose.\n\n\"It hurts so much! It hurts so much! It hurts so much!!!!\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest kept yelling.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nAnother figure appeared at the doorway.\n\nZhang Yanfeng instinctively lunged forward. Although his body had only just fully awakened and was still somewhat weak, his instincts as a seasoned detective made him react without thinking.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng's three attacks were casually parried with one hand by the other party.\n\nFollowing that,\n\nThat hand pushed forward gently,\n\nDirectly hitting Zhang Yanfeng's chest.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng was sent flying backward, crashing into the wall, and then slumped down, landing back on the bed.\n\n\"Kachik!\"\n\nLawyer An turned on the light,\n\nAnd the room was instantly illuminated.\n\nZhang Yanfeng didn't recognize Lawyer An, but he recognized the old Daoist priest squatting on the ground, covering his face.\n\nUh...\n\nFor a moment,\n\nZhang Yanfeng realized,\n\nThat he might have just done something wrong.\n\nThe old Daoist priest looked up,\n\nAnd glared at Zhang Yanfeng, his eyes wide with anger,\n\n\"It's the second time, it's the second time, it's the second time!!!!\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest roared,\n\n\"A bald donkey can endure, but this humble priest cannot!\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nThe old Daoist priest grabbed the broom placed by the door and prepared to beat Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nNever mind if you just woke up,\n\nNever mind if you're a hero,\n\nYou've bullied me twice, damn it!\n\nLawyer An gently extended his foot, tripping the old Daoist priest.\n\nThe old Daoist priest flew forward, his head hitting the wall, and he also fell onto the bed, seeing stars.\n\n\"Are... are you okay?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng asked the old Daoist priest.\n\n\"If you're awake, come down with me to see the boss.\"\n\nLawyer An pointed at Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThe boss?\n\nIs it him?\n\nZhang Yanfeng stood up and followed Lawyer An downstairs. He seemed to remember something; he was negotiating at a kindergarten, then all he remembered was the huge fire, and it was so hot...\n\nDid Zhou Ze save him?\n\nZhang Yanfeng patted his head, organizing his thoughts.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nHe owed Zhou Ze another favor.\n\nIt would be difficult to repay.\n\nIf all else failed, he could only help him get a driver's license?\n\nAfter all, he wasn't exactly driving without a license; he knew how to drive. Although it wasn't by the book, rules were for the living, right?\n\nHe wasn't alive.\n\nAs they went down the stairs, Lawyer An asked, \"What are you thinking about?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nLawyer An chuckled. The police officer who had just woken up seemed to still not quite understand what had happened.\n\nDownstairs,\n\nBoss Zhou was drinking coffee. When he looked up, he saw An Buqi¹ walking down, oh, and Old Zhang¹ walking down with him.\n\n\"You're awake, Old Zhang.\"\n\nZhou Ze greeted him.\n\n\"Yes, I'm awake. Thank you.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng walked over. He hadn't really owed many people favors because he was a police officer. Ordinary people's favors were easy to repay, but precisely because he was a police officer, he often couldn't engage in favors.\n\n\"Did you get your driver's license?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\nHe felt a bit awkward and inexplicably uneasy. He wanted to go home or back to the police station office. For some reason, he desperately wanted to leave this place.\n\nBecause of this, he decided to help Zhou Ze as much as he could, to repay a small part of the favor. As for future matters, that would be for later.\n\n\"No, I've been busy lately.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nBusy drinking tea,\n\nBusy basking in the sun,\n\nBusy sleeping with the maid.\n\nWhat a fulfilling and busy life.\n\n\"I'll help you get it; it shouldn't be a big problem, but you have to be careful when driving in the future. That's all for now, I need to get back to the police station to check in. By the way, how long was I unconscious?\"\n\n\"Three or four days, I think,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then I need to hurry back.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng headed for the door and pushed open the bookstore door.\n\nAn old man stood at the entrance of the bookstore, hunched over. Zhang Yanfeng almost knocked him over when he opened the door.\n\nThe old man wasn't knocked over,\n\nBut he was greatly startled,\n\nAnd directly fell to the ground.\n\nZhang Yanfeng thought he had opened the door too forcefully and scared the old man, so he immediately squatted down to help the old man up.\n\nHe was a police officer,\n\nSo he wasn't afraid to help the elderly.\n\nOh,\n\nTo be precise,\n\nHe thought he was a police officer, so he felt no fear.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe old man wasn't that timid.\n\nAt this point, being timid was pointless.\n\nHe wasn't scared by Zhang Yanfeng's sudden door-opening action,\n\nBut by Zhang Yanfeng himself.\n\nNow,\n\nZhang Yanfeng was actually squatting down to help him up,\n\nWhich completely overwhelmed the old man, who, in his fear and trepidation, knelt down and kowtowed to Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"I dare not, I dare not, I dare not...\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng was stunned.\n\nWhat was going on?\n\nLawyer An stood beside Zhou Ze, watching the scene outside, and said with some helplessness, \"Most people's souls are very fragile. The reason why ghost couriers and many evil spirits who escape from hell have special abilities can also be understood as mutations.\n\nIn the environment of hell, they were stimulated or tortured, causing their soul strength to increase and produce other mutations. When they returned to the mortal world and entered a physical body, they would have special abilities accompanying them.\n\nLike me, like Lin Ke¹,\n\nBut this one here, his soul hasn't been to hell. Although you've swapped him through, it's successful, but honestly, he has no abilities. Just having a ghost courier certificate, he can't do the job of a ghost courier, and for you, it's not very useful.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"I just didn't want him to die.\"\n\nAs for whether it was useful or not,\n\nThat wasn't within Boss Zhou's consideration.\n\n\"Willful,\" Lawyer An pouted.\n\nThe old man crawled into the bookstore,\n\nZhang Yanfeng followed behind him.\n\n\"What's his deal?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked, pointing at the old man, looking at the people in the bookstore.\n\nXu Qinglang turned to prepare the cold dishes.\n\nThe old Daoist priest with a band-aid on his face also came over and intimately grabbed the old man to chat about children's education,\n\nFor example, is your son filial?\n\nIs your daughter filial?\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng asked again.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng and said calmly, \"He's not human.\"\n\n\"Not human?\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"He's a ghost.\"\n\n\"Ghost...\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng mumbled the word. It wasn't that he couldn't accept it, as he knew some of Zhou Ze's identity. However, what puzzled him was something else.\n\n\"Why can I see ghosts?\"\n\nYes,\n\nWhy could he see ghosts?\n\nAnd,\n\nGhosts were so real!\n\n\"Because you are already dead too,\" Zhou Ze said, resting his hands on the counter and looking calmly at Zhang Yanfeng in front of him.\n\n\"I am also... already... dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, dead.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng swallowed.\n\nHe finally remembered,\n\nThe outcome of that day,\n\nAnd the last scene,\n\nHe had tackled the assailant out the window,\n\nThe assailant had set himself on fire with gasoline,\n\nAnd then he and the assailant were engulfed in flames.\n\n\"Did I die...\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng leaned against the door frame and sat down.\n\nHe didn't cry or wail about his death.\n\nIn fact, when he went to negotiate with the assailant,\n\nHe had called Zhou Ze and asked Zhou Ze about what happens after death.\n\n\"What about the kindergarten children and teachers?\"\n\n\"They were all saved. In the entire incident, except for your honorable sacrifice, everyone else is fine.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng let out a long sigh.\n\nIt was worth dying for,\n\nNo regrets.\n\n\"Actually, the feeling after death is quite real.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng looked at his hands,\n\nAnd even pinched his arm.\n\n\"It feels no different from when I was alive.\"\n\n\"You can look to your left again,\" Zhou Ze said, taking out two balls of cotton.\n\n\"To the left?\"\n\n\"The glass on the left, look carefully.\" After saying this, Zhou Ze stuffed the cotton into his ears and then picked up his cup, taking a sip of coffee.\n\nZhang Yanfeng looked at the glass,\n\nAnd saw his reflection in the glass.\n\nIt was an unfamiliar face.\n\nHe reached out,\n\nAnd touched his face.\n\nThe person in the glass mirrored his every action.\n\nAfter a ten-second pause,\n\nZhang Yanfeng finally realized what was happening.\n\nThis veteran detective, who had been in the police force for twenty to thirty years, now heard the sound of his worldview completely collapsing.\n\nAnd,\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!\"",

    "content": "The next morning, the weather was clear and sunny, with not a cloud in sight – a rare fine day.\n\nWhen Boss Zhou came downstairs after waking up, he saw Zhang Yanfeng still sitting on the sofa, staring blankly. It was evident that Officer Zhang hadn't recovered from the massive shock of his identity change. In fact, anyone who woke up to find themselves in a different body and with a different identity would likely be in a similar state. Boss Zhou, having retained consciousness after his death, had experienced two days of his own rescue, funeral, embalming, mourning, and cremation. This prolonged preparation allowed him to adapt much faster upon entering Xu Le's body.\n\nOld Zhang’s situation was something he had to overcome himself. Actually, he had many things to overcome. For instance, eating. Boss Zhou could have Xu Qinglang continue making plum juice. And sleeping. For sleeping, Boss Zhou would have him learn meditation with Lawyer An.\n\nLawyer An was a very shrewd person. Although he had helped Zhou Ze rescue Zhang Yanfeng and bring about his successful resurrection, Lawyer An didn't think much of Zhang Yanfeng, feeling it was a failed investment.\n\nZhou Ze stood by the bar. Uncharacteristically, he wasn't sitting in his usual spot, basking in the sun with a coffee. Little Loli was already dressed and ready, sitting in Lawyer An's car, constantly urging Zhou Ze. Xu Qinglang was driving another car, with Old Daoist, Yingying, and Deadpool inside.\n\nBoss Zhou walked up to Officer Zhang and said, \"Still haven't snapped out of it?\"\n\nOfficer Zhang shook his head. He needed more time, otherwise, his worldview couldn't be reshaped. He remembered Zhou Ze had said he would protect his worldview.\n\n\"Monkey, keep an eye on him. If he tries to leave or do anything, call me,\" Zhou Ze shouted to Little Monkey behind the bar. The Monkey nodded, wiggled its bottom, indicating it understood.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze also got into the car.\n\nThe day's events were actually arranged by Little Loli and Lawyer An. As a formidable businesswoman in her previous life, who had commanded considerable influence in the business world, she still possessed ambition and pride even after entering Little Loli's body, desiring to climb higher and distinguish herself. She had pestered Lawyer An to spar with her. Lawyer An agreed, thinking, \"If we're going to spar, we might as well do it together.\"\n\nAlthough they had pledged allegiance to Zhou Ze and recognized him as their boss, Lawyer An found it difficult to tolerate the vast structure of the bookstore, its bloated staff, and its prevailing laid-back work ethic. Perhaps it was because he hadn't been assimilated yet. Therefore, Lawyer An felt that before he was assimilated, he should at least make an effort to try and bring about some changes in the bookstore.\n\nEveryone drove to a villa nearby, which was one of Yingying's properties. Little Loli led the way; she had initiated this \"activity\" and was the most enthusiastic. Yingying, however, appeared somewhat worried.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It's probably about the property tax,\" Lawyer An replied, pointing to Xu Qinglang, who also looked worried. Although it was still uncertain whether it would be implemented, the rumors were growing louder. Even if there were a tax-exempt area, it was predictable that no matter how large the exemption limit was, it wouldn't make much difference to Yingying and Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Don't worry. Even if it's implemented, it won't be difficult to help you with tax avoidance,\" Lawyer An said with a chuckle, urging the people behind him to hurry.\n\nThey all entered the underground garage, a space comparable in size to two basketball courts. Little Loli was already standing on the other side, looking quite impatient. Yingying brought over a chair, and Zhou Ze sat down. Old Daoist, Xu Qinglang, and Deadpool stood on the other side.\n\nTo be honest, few people were genuinely interested in what was about to happen. They were dragged along, and there was no way to refuse. Of course, the most important factor was that the boss, sitting in the chair, clearly showed a casual demeanor, as if he were just there to show support.\n\nLawyer An glanced at Zhou Ze, his eyes narrowing slightly. \"This is troublesome,\" he thought. \"With this team, it's manageable now, but when he's promoted to Captain and then to Inspector, they'll be at a significant disadvantage. How did he find them? He assembled a group of like-minded people who are all content to be slacking off?\"\n\nActually, Lawyer An was mistaken. Before meeting Zhou Ze, Old Xu and Old Daoist were quite proactive and healthy.\n\n\"Disappointed?\" Little Loli asked. Lawyer An nodded. \"But this kind of life, to be honest, is really desirable and can be quite addictive.\" As she spoke, she began to undress, taking off her athletic jacket to reveal a form-fitting suit underneath. Little Loli tilted her head. \"Former Inspector, please provide some guidance.\" With that, Little Loli lunged forward.\n\n...\n\n\"They've started,\" Old Daoist exclaimed. Xu Qinglang nodded. Bai Yingying watched the scene below with curiosity. Deadpool was silently scratching his head, looking around for any insects. Zhou Ze, meanwhile, yawned, idly spinning a pen in his right hand. Since his awakening, Zhou Ze had kept this pen with him.\n\n...\n\nLittle Loli's speed wasn't very high. Her charge was just a feint. Then, she opened her mouth, her tongue shooting out instantly, like a reddened iron whip, lashing out at Lawyer An.\n\n\"The innate ability is a mutation caused by stimulation in hell. It's difficult to make further changes, so Ghost Messengers cannot cultivate it because you can only use your unique ability. It's more than enough to deal with ordinary wandering souls. But it's not impossible to improve. Any power, when researched to its extreme, is astonishing.\" Lawyer An explained, watching Little Loli's tongue. The observers from afar nodded in unison, adopting the posture of students impressed by a teacher's lecture. Boss Zhou glanced at the pen in his hand.\n\n\"Bang!\" Little Loli's tongue struck Lawyer An. However, in the next moment, Lawyer An's left hand grasped Little Loli's tongue and yanked it forward violently! Little Loli, like a kite with a broken string, flew backward, but using the momentum generated by the thrashing tongue, she managed to stabilize herself and land steadily. Looking up, she saw Lawyer An in front of her, a smile of excitement on her lips. \"It seems that Lord Xie Xun has not only lost his official status but also his power.\" Lawyer An nodded.\n\nThe next moment, Little Loli charged again, her tongue splitting in two in mid-air. One part went to entangle, while the other attacked. Lawyer An's left hand's flesh slowly dissipated, revealing bare white bone.\n\n\"Buzz!\" With a sound like tearing fabric, the part of Little Loli's tongue responsible for entanglement was directly severed, and the other attacking tongue was pierced by the bone hand and began to rot!\n\n\"Bang!\" Little Loli's body crashed heavily onto the ground. Her long tongue disappeared. She opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but only \"Wuwuwuwu\" came out, along with a mouthful of blood and saliva.\n\n...\n\nOld Daoist gasped. Xu Qinglang's expression also changed. Bai Yingying, seeing Little Loli beaten so badly, was so excited she almost \"yelped.\" Deadpool continued to look for mosquitoes. Zhou Ze smiled. This Lawyer An was truly a model of \"the weak appearing strong,\" a professional at \"playing the pig to eat the tiger.\" Of course, this also showed his attitude. If he truly had ulterior motives for lurking here, he wouldn't have agreed to Little Loli's sparring request or displayed his strength in front of everyone.\n\nLittle Loli twitched for a long time before slowly getting up. She spat out two mouthfuls of blood, then stuck her fingers into her mouth and stirred, digging out two pieces of shredded flesh. \"It hurts so much...\" The tongue was Little Loli's weapon. Although it was severed, for her, restoration and regrowth were not a problem, at least for that part of her body. But honestly, watching a little girl spit blood and then chunks of flesh, and then speak with a new tongue, was quite a strange sight.\n\n\"Solely using the tongue for attack carries too much cost and risk,\" Lawyer An said, his gaze shifting to the observers beside him, focusing particularly on Zhou Ze. \"Only if the boss gets motivated can this team hope to change its old ways.\" Therefore, if the boss were to come down and be beaten by him, the bookstore's atmosphere should be able to improve immediately.\n\n\"He's very arrogant. He's looking at me,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing at Lawyer An below, and then looking at the subordinates standing beside him. Old Daoist looked up at the ceiling as if admiring the white clouds and blue sky, but in reality, the garage ceiling was just a concrete slab. It was a joke. Little Loli had always been the strongest force in the bookstore under the boss's rampage, and she had been beaten like this. Was he going to throw his life away? Xu Qinglang took out his phone, as if contemplating tonight's menu. Yingying, however, seemed eager. Fighting, she knew how to do that too!\n\nBut at that very moment, a spider crawled onto the ceiling directly above and above Lawyer An. Deadpool immediately jumped out, caught the insect with one hand, and landed. Before he could put it in his mouth, Lawyer An shouted from below, \"Next, is it you?\" Lawyer An's bone claw directly pierced Deadpool's chest, and then with one foot, he kicked Deadpool away. Knowing Deadpool's terrifying recovery abilities, Lawyer An didn't hold back, just as he had unhesitatingly severed Little Loli's tongue when he knew it could regenerate.\n\nDeadpool's chest had a hole in it. He hit the wall and then slowly slid down, but he wasn't angry or in pain. Instead, he immediately put the spider in his mouth and began to chew contentedly. \"So delicious!\" Lawyer An wiped his face. He felt his struggles were somewhat futile.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze deliberately glanced at Deadpool and said, \"Be serious. Have a match with him.\"\n\n---\n\nCurrently, it's 4,500 monthly votes.

    "content": "Deadpool shakily stood up, flesh buds continuously growing around the hole in his chest, connecting together. Then, layers of milky white secretion spread out, covering the entire wound, and fresh, tender flesh was born.\n\nThis terrifying regenerative ability indeed surpassed normal human understanding.\n\nZhou Ze's ashes from his previous life were inside, and the original host was that Japanese priest who liked to stir up trouble. He had also undergone a rebirth, similar to a plant.\n\nIt was hard to say if he was human, or if he was a plant. It wasn't accurate to call him a zombie or similar creatures. In short, he was a freak created by the bookstore.\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had simply thrown his minced meat into a glass tank, expecting him to slowly recover;\n\nAs a result, the little monkey peed in it while bored,\n\nThen planted a seed,\n\nAnd finally, a fruit grew.\n\nOld Dao couldn't understand why his boss wanted Deadpool to fight. Or perhaps, the boss wanted to appease Lawyer An, finding an unkillable cockroach for Lawyer An to vent his anger on?\n\nIt was hard not to think that way. After all, Deadpool's position in the bookstore used to be as a cleaner. After the plant rebirth, he took on the additional role of \"Bookstore Insect Fear Dominator.\"\n\nHowever, when it came to fighting, it seemed Deadpool had hardly ever fought.\n\nFrom Old Dao's personal perspective, he was very unhappy with Lawyer An.\n\nEveryone followed the lazy boss,\n\nLiving comfortably and eating well together, how wonderful were the days?\n\nHe was already this old, he couldn't handle the exertion.\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\nYingying lowered her head, looking at her boss. In Yingying's opinion, it would be better to let herself fight than Deadpool. She wasn't afraid of fighting, and she had always stayed by the boss's side, often passively absorbing the good luck aura emanating from the boss.\n\nAlthough she only had two hundred years of cultivation,\n\nShe was by no means comparable to ordinary two-hundred-year-old zombies!!!\n\n\"Let's see for now.\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his chin.\n\nZhou Ze always felt that beneath Deadpool's calm and innocent, dumb-cute demeanor, something was hidden. Especially last time, he actually sneaked out of the bookstore to cause trouble for the brother-sister duo at the internet cafe.\n\nZhou Ze heard about this from Old Dao. Although no one else had noticed any other changes in Deadpool after that, Zhou Ze, as the one who was \"connected by heart\" with him, had sensed the change in Deadpool.\n\nSpecifically what it was,\n\nHe couldn't say,\n\nBut if they fought, he would understand.\n\nBoss Zhou certainly knew what Lawyer An and the little loli were thinking – to change the bookstore's lazy atmosphere. Boss Zhou neither approved nor disapproved of this.\n\nOf course,\n\nAs long as it didn't affect him.\n\nIt was best for others to strive as they wished.\n\n...\n\nDeadpool recovered from his injuries,\n\nHis arms hung low,\n\nHe just looked at Lawyer An,\n\nHis body swaying slowly left and right, like an old pendulum.\n\nHe couldn't fight, nor had he ever learned to fight, so he naturally didn't know any fighting stances. But since his godfather asked him to fight, he would definitely fight.\n\nA smile appeared on Lawyer An's lips, a somewhat bitter smile. This bookstore seemed beyond saving.\n\nWas this how they appeased people?\n\nYou don't come down to fight yourselves,\n\nAnd you, the boss, don't come down to fight,\n\nYou send a mosquito coil down for me to beat?\n\nAlthough he hadn't been at the bookstore for long, Lawyer An knew that the person in front of him was actually the bookstore's human mosquito coil, insecticide, cleaner, and general laborer.\n\nAre you really filming \"Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils\" or \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\"?\n\nIs every random person pulled out, like a sweeping monk, a heavenly being?\n\nDeadpool started to attack,\n\nHe began to run,\n\nHe began to sprint,\n\nHe began to swing his arms,\n\nHe began to open his mouth,\n\nThis posture,\n\nMade Xu Qinglang fall into thought, it felt very familiar.\n\nOh,\n\nHe remembered,\n\nIt seemed that at the beginning, Boss Zhou also fought like this.\n\nLike a woman, he would wave his fingernails and start scratching.\n\nAfter all, although Boss Zhou often used a knife in his previous life, he held a scalpel, not a cleaver, so he was really not good at fighting.\n\nRight now,\n\nDeadpool had truly inherited his father's style.\n\nLawyer An frowned. He found this kind of fighting very uninteresting. With a wave of his skeletal hand, a gust of wind struck, and Deadpool was sent flying again, without even a chance for close combat.\n\n\"It's utterly uninteresting.\"\n\nAfter Lawyer An said that,\n\nHe looked up at Zhou Ze, who was sitting on a chair watching from the side.\n\n\"Boss, why don't you come down and we can spar?\"\n\nZhou Ze was still twirling his pen, ignoring him.\n\nThe little loli didn't chime in this time either.\n\nEveryone else looked at each other in dismay.\n\nLawyer An was getting too arrogant.\n\nYou should just play the pig to eat the tiger.\n\nYou want to spar with the boss?\n\nThe little loli also shook her head. She knew Zhou Ze's background, and she had also told Lawyer An, but hearing is not seeing. Lawyer An had never directly encountered Zhou Ze when he was unleashing his full power.\n\n\"Beat him down, and then I'll fight you.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nOver there,\n\nDeadpool stood up again,\n\nHis clothes were already tattered, but the wounds on his body were still steadily healing.\n\n\"Him?\"\n\nLawyer An was somewhat dispirited and said directly,\n\n\"If he can make me take a step back, I'll admit I'm wrong. From now on, whatever happens in the bookstore will be as it is, and I won't complain.\"\n\nIf the bookstore was compared to a trading company, then Zhou Ze would certainly be the owner, and Lawyer An was the head accountant hired by Zhou Ze. It was clear that the two sides had a difference in development direction.\n\nSince there was a divergence, a path to resolve it had to be found.\n\nThis was precisely why Lawyer An agreed to the little loli's trial this time.\n\nHe was a sophisticated egoist. His past glory, combined with his personality's pursuit of order and rules, made it difficult for him to tolerate the current atmosphere of the bookstore.\n\nTo put it more vividly, Lawyer An felt like a disgraced official (of course, he was now a commoner) who, in his disgrace, had met the \"Third Prince Zhu\" of the previous dynasty, or perhaps \"Third Prince Zhou.\"\n\nHe pinned his future glory and return on this \"Third Prince Zhou,\" but this Third Prince Zhou seemed not to fully understand what he wanted to do, and was still acting lazy every day. If he was lazy, what would happen to him in the future?\n\nDeadpool charged forward again,\n\nHe could sense his godfather's trust in him.\n\nLawyer An casually waved his hand,\n\nIntending to send this plate of mosquito repellent flying again.\n\nMosquito repellent should be used to deal with mosquitoes, not for fighting.\n\nHowever,\n\nHe missed.\n\nLawyer An was stunned for a moment,\n\nThen,\n\nHe saw Deadpool suddenly change direction and pounce at him from the side.\n\nThe bone claws pressed down again,\n\nA mosquito coil that could change direction,\n\nWas still a mosquito coil.\n\n\"Amen!\"\n\nA low voice came from the mosquito coil,\n\nAnd then,\n\nAn incredible scene occurred.\n\nDeadpool's hand actually accurately grabbed Lawyer An's bone claws.\n\nThe two sides,\n\nHad actually fallen into a stalemate.\n\nLawyer An's expression became serious,\n\nHe suddenly couldn't understand the mosquito coil in front of him.\n\nA mosquito coil with built-in voice announcement?\n\nDid it also store audio files of the Bible?\n\nAnd,\n\nHis strength,\n\nHow did it suddenly become so great?\n\nIn the distance,\n\nBai Yingying's eyes widened,\n\nOld Dao's jaw dropped,\n\nXu Qinglang's expression suddenly twitched,\n\nEven the little loli had a serious and disbelieving look on her face.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze,\n\nHad a smile on his lips,\n\nAs if everything was within his control.\n\nIn reality, he was panicking inside,\n\nBut he still had to pretend that everything was arranged behind the scenes by him.\n\nBeing a boss, being a leader,\n\nRequired pretense.\n\nHowever, his pen stopped twirling.\n\n\"Interesting.\"\n\nLawyer An began to exert force,\n\nBegan to press down,\n\nThe hands of Deadpool and Lawyer An, where their bone claws were interlocked, began to rapidly decay and melt. But at the same time, he was also constantly recovering. However, the gap in strength was becoming apparent, and Deadpool's hand was being pressed down continuously.\n\nHe began to panic,\n\nBegan to get angry,\n\nBecause his godfather had asked him to fight.\n\nAlthough he wasn't smart,\n\nHe at least understood one thing:\n\nSince his godfather had asked him to fight,\n\nHe definitely didn't want him to lose.\n\nHe became anxious,\n\nHe became distressed,\n\nAnd then,\n\nHe opened his mouth and shouted:\n\n\"God said, let there be light!\"\n\nThen,\n\nLight appeared.\n\nA blinding white light appeared,\n\nLawyer An was sent flying backward, landing heavily on the side. His bone claws had a scorched mark, and an unbearable stinging pain shot through him.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nIt gave Lawyer An the illusion that he was fighting a Western priest.\n\nDeadpool was also sent flying backward, crashing into the wall. He was even more miserable.\n\n\"He resembles someone quite a bit,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"Mm, that Japanese priest,\" Zhou Ze smiled and stood up from his chair.\n\nDeadpool's brain was still a bit fuzzy. Although he seemed to have awakened some of the abilities inherited from the Japanese priest, he didn't know how to apply them specifically.\n\nFor example, the holy light carrying pure power,\n\nWhile it had injured Lawyer An, who was also of an evil nature,\n\nIt caused even greater damage to himself, because he was no longer a living person, nor a priest, but a more bizarre and unclassifiable evil existence.\n\n\"You lost.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked towards Lawyer An.\n\nLawyer An had said that as long as Deadpool could push him back, he would admit defeat. Now, not only was he pushed back, he was sent flying. He had thoroughly lost.\n\n\"What exactly is this thing?\"\n\nLawyer An asked in confusion.\n\nA sweeping monk?\n\nA mosquito coil?\n\nRadar insecticide?\n\n\"You know, life in the bookstore is a bit boring, oh no, a bit too leisurely, so I sometimes like to grow some flowers and plants.\"\n\n\"And then?\" Lawyer An asked.\n\n\"And then I planted him.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then he grew.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at Deadpool.\n\n\"So, what are you trying to say, Boss?\"\n\n\"What I want to say is that, actually, it's quite good to stay at home, read the newspaper, and drink tea. If there's nothing to do, you can grow some flowers and plants or raise some small animals.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nRaising some cute little snakes or playing with a couple of weasels,\n\nMight be more effective than going out to fight and kill.\"\n\n\"...\" Lawyer An.\n\n——————\n\nLast night, I thought about a slogan for requesting monthly votes.\n\nI remember watching \"Xian Ni\" in middle school, and Ear Root's slogan \"Fellow cultivators, dare you to fight?\" for monthly votes felt very imposing and deeply impressed me.\n\nLong wanted to imitate it, \"Fellow guests from hell, why fear a fight,\" but it just didn't roll off the tongue.\n\nAfter thinking,\n\nHmm,\n\nI thought of a very fitting slogan for requesting monthly votes:\n\n\"You dead spirits,\n\nVote for me!\"",

    "content": "Boss Zhou's mention of raising small animals wasn't baseless or a mere whim. He suddenly remembered that his bookstore's Yin-Yang Ledger still listed two \"Northeastern Great Immortals.\" It wasn't right to keep them confined like that. He needed to find a way for them to come out and be useful, contributing to the bookstore's future development.\n\nTherefore, when he left the villa, Zhou Ze directly instructed the old Daoist priest to buy a snake and a yellow weasel. The old Daoist priest nodded in agreement. Although buying a yellow weasel in Tongcheng would be quite difficult, the old Daoist priest was confident he could manage it. He had a clear understanding of his role: when the boss needed errands run, he would run them perfectly. When the boss was tired and needed a push, he would provide it.\n\nOn the way back, the little loli was very excited, constantly talking to Lawyer An, seeking advice on how to improve her \"tongue skills\" and her overall oral performance. Lawyer An offered several guiding suggestions, which greatly benefited the little loli.\n\nThat day was like a stone dropped into a pond; there weren't many ripples. However, when Zhou Ze came out of his bedroom that evening, he noticed activity in Old Xu's room. Pushing open Old Xu's door, Zhou Ze saw Old Xu sitting at his desk, drawing talismans. He was shirtless, diligently drawing talismans with a brush dipped in cinnabar-like ink. Despite the air conditioning in the room, he was drenched in sweat. His lower body was in a horse stance, truly accomplishing both physical training and talisman drawing simultaneously.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes widened in shock. In the past, Xu Qinglang would have abhorred such a posture, believing it would lead to overly developed muscles that would detract from the shape of his legs.\n\n\"Old Xu, working hard?\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded without looking back at Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze, getting no reaction, left the room. Going downstairs, he saw the little loli in a private room. Through a gap in the door, he could see her continuously forming hand seals, with sounds of \"swish, swish, swish\" echoing from the room as her tongue flitted about. Deadpool was sitting with Lawyer An, who seemed to be explaining something to him. Deadpool nodded as if he understood, while Lawyer An showed him photos and videos on his phone. Deadpool watched, occasionally sticking out his tongue to catch a passing mosquito. As for how much he truly understood, even he might not know. But Lawyer An, like an infinitely patient preschool teacher, continued his explanations without a hint of impatience.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt isolated. Before, his employees were richer than him, and he felt isolated. Now, his employees were more diligent than him, and he felt isolated. He sat down in his usual spot, and Yingying brought him tea, placing it before him. Zhou Ze sighed in relief. Regardless of how the outside world changed, Yingying would always be by his side, and that was enough.\n\n\"Boss, Lawyer An said I shouldn't spend too much time playing games and should practice martial arts, like signing up for a Taekwondo class or something. He said I'm strong and healthy, but I don't really know how to fight and need to learn. I think he's right! That way, when you need someone to fight, you can send Yingying!!!\"\n\n\"…………\" Zhou Ze.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze smelled a fragrance wafting from the kitchen. Old Xu was practicing in his room; who would be cooking?\n\n\"Who's in the kitchen?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nAt that moment, the old Daoist priest walked down from upstairs, rubbing his earlobe. Seeing Zhou Ze descend, he immediately called out, as if seeking praise, \"Boss, the big stew is almost ready. Shall we have it for a late-night snack? I'm not bragging, but finding a lively yellow weasel in Tongcheng is truly difficult. Snakes are easier to find, there are plenty. Yellow weasels, we don't have them here, and people here don't have a taste for wild game. I put a lot of effort into getting it.\"\n\n\"And then you stewed them?\"\n\nDark lines appeared on Zhou Ze's face. He had asked the old Daoist priest to buy a snake and a yellow weasel so that he could see if there was a chance for the two Great Immortals in the Yin-Yang Ledger to possess them, even if it was just to be guard animals. But the old Daoist priest had directly stewed the purchased wild game. Was he expecting the two Great Immortals to possess the pot?\n\n\"Yes, don't worry, I have experience with this big stew. Two hundred years ago, when I went to the Northeast to catch demons, I...\"\n\n\"Go buy two live ones and keep them.\" Zhou Ze, too lazy to deal with the old Daoist priest any further.\n\n\"Buy more?\" the old Daoist priest was stunned.\n\n\"I want live ones!\"\n\nWhy didn't you say so earlier!\n\n\"Boss, it was my oversight. I'll go buy them tomorrow. If they aren't in Tongcheng, I'll check nearby cities and counties.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and lay down on the sofa. Everyone was busy with their own affairs. Why were they all working so hard? Isn't it more comfortable to just lie down?\n\nThen, Zhou Ze sat up again and asked, \"Where did Old Zhang go?\"\n\nIndeed, where did Old Zhang go? When Zhou Ze left in the morning, he had instructed Old Zhang to stay at the bookstore and take some time to recover. He remembered Old Zhang was still at the store when he returned in the morning. How come after his nap, Old Zhang was gone?\n\n\"Oh, Old Zhang, he went out. Said he wanted to take a walk and look around. He went out not long ago, maybe two hours ago,\" the old Daoist priest replied.\n\n\"Right, Monkey went with him too. I asked Little Monkey to keep an eye on him, since he just came back from soul possession, and I was worried something might happen to him.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, acknowledging the information. He then instructed the old Daoist priest, \"Buy Old Zhang some clothes tomorrow, and get him a phone and a SIM card. As for his ID card...\" He thought for a moment and shook his head. \"For now, let him stay at the bookstore. He doesn't need an ID card.\"\n\n\"Okay, noted.\"\n\nAfter giving these instructions, Zhou Ze lay down again. As night fully fell, the old Daoist priest opened the bookstore's door and turned on the neon sign, signaling the start of business for the night. Lawyer An walked over and sat beside Zhou Ze, reaching for the freshly poured coffee in front of him. However, Zhou Ze beat him to it, picked up the coffee, took a big gulp, and then put it down.\n\n\"…………\" Lawyer An.\n\n\"The changes are quite significant,\" Lawyer An said.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze was actually contemplating whether bringing Lawyer An into the bookstore was the right decision. According to Zhou Ze's previous plan, it would have been enough for everyone to be comfortable and live a leisurely life, without so much hardship or effort. But clearly, Lawyer An didn't think that way and wasn't willing to act that way. This person was too driven by purpose.\n\n\"By the way, hasn't he come back yet?\" Lawyer An asked.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"That police officer.\"\n\n\"Not yet. He's probably gone looking for a place to drink.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Lawyer An frowned.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Next time, don't let him go out, because of that corpse.\"\n\n\"Isn't that the drunkard's body?\"\n\n\"Where would a drunkard come from in the middle of the night? And what drunkard? What drunkard?\" Lawyer An scratched his head, looking distressed. \"Why do I feel like I've forgotten something?\"\n\n\"Alright, skip it, skip it.\" Zhou Ze interrupted Lawyer An's muttering. Regarding that pen, since Lawyer An had forgotten, there was no need to bring it up again. In fact, if Zhou Ze hadn't obtained that pen, he himself would have been \"forgotten.\"\n\n\"Tell me more about that corpse, what happened?\"\n\n\"That corpse needs to stay out of sight for now. It might cause some trouble.\"\n\n\"Where did you get that corpse from, anyway?\"\n\n\"I got it from a gang in a neighboring city. They were having an internal conflict or something and drowned him.\"\n\n\"You were there at the time?\"\n\n\"I was right there watching, waiting to collect the body. I love bodies with criminal records like this; it makes it easier for me to put my customers in prison.\"\n\n\"So, Zhang Yanfeng possessed a drug dealer?\"\n\n\"Something like that, but he was a small-time player, not a big shot. In any case, he wouldn't be executed immediately upon entering prison, otherwise, I wouldn't have gone through all this trouble. I have cold storage units in Tongcheng, Changzhou, and a few other places, located near the wholesale market, for storing bodies. I take them out when needed.\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his forehead. This fact must be a huge blow to Old Zhang, going from being a police officer to being reincarnated into a criminal.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak!!!\"\n\nAt this moment, Little Monkey squeezed in through the door and immediately jumped onto the counter, gesturing wildly.\n\n\"Where's Old Zhang?\" Zhou Ze asked Monkey.\n\nLittle Monkey immediately sat down, stuffing things into its mouth with one hand while making drinking gestures with the other. It would also wave its mouth, acting as if it was very spicy.\n\n\"Drinking and eating peanuts at a small restaurant?\" Zhou Ze was stunned. \"Where did he get the money?\"\n\nLittle Monkey patted its small backpack and took out several stacks of money. Zhou Ze's gaze sharpened. Even Monkey was so rich?\n\n\"Were you treating him?\" Lawyer An asked.\n\nMonkey nodded.\n\n\"Then where is he now? Drunk and didn't come back?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nMonkey shook its head, then raised both hands and waved them, continuously making \"jijijijiji...\" sounds from its mouth. After listening for a long time, Zhou Ze finally understood and immediately stood up, shouting, \"Old Zhang was arrested by the police?\"\n\nMonkey had just imitated the sound of a police siren! Old Zhang, having returned from reincarnation, was arrested by his former subordinates or colleagues, the police officers of Tongcheng! Old Zhang must be going crazy now. He was still talking about needing some time to reshape his worldview earlier today, and now it's been perfectly reshaped.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak!!!\" Monkey nodded immediately, then brought its two paws together behind its back, bent over, and walked back and forth on the counter, signifying that Old Zhang was cuffed and taken away...",

He remembered that the monkey had cigarettes in his pocket, but after he was arrested by the police in the restaurant, the monkey had disappeared.\nHe didn't think about whether Zhou Ze would come to rescue him,\nbut was simply lost in a daze.\n\nZhang Yanfeng suddenly felt that\nperhaps it would have been better if he had just gone to hell without all this trouble?\nOf course, he didn't blame Zhou Ze. It wasn't easy for someone to bring him back to life, and he couldn't be so ungrateful.\n\nA television was hung on the wall of the police station's detention center, showing news broadcasts or propaganda and educational films.\nEntertainment programs were out of the question,\nyou couldn't expect to watch \"Friends\" or \"iPartment\" in a detention center.\n\nHowever,\nwhat was being shown on the TV screen caught Old Zhang's eye.\nIt was a documentary,\nthe protagonist,\nwas himself.\nAnd there was even a CCTV logo on the screen,\nmeaning it was a documentary produced by CCTV.\nIt told the touching story of a veteran detective\nwho sacrificed himself to save kindergarten teachers and students by single-handedly negotiating and fighting with the perpetrator, thereby rescuing the hostages.\nThere were also screenshots of netizens' comments.\nIt was said that a few days ago, the Weibo account \"Tongcheng Ping'an\" posted promotional reports about his sacrifice and hostage rescue, which received hundreds of thousands of retweets, overshadowing many young idols who were trimming their nails that day or whose dogs had gone missing, and topping the trending topics for those days.\nThe documentary was well-made and very moving.\nZhang Yanfeng himself watched it and felt very moved, and at the same time, he felt how great he was.\nIt was like analyzing and understanding the thoughts and feelings expressed by the authors in ancient poems and texts in middle school textbooks.\nPerhaps if the original authors saw the well-reasoned analysis by the Chinese teachers, they would also fall into deep thought.\nDamn it,\nwhen I wrote this line of poetry, it contained such a vast and complex meaning?\nI clearly just wanted to write about flowers, grass, mountains, and water, so how did you infer my patriotism, love for the people, and my melancholy and unfulfilled ambitions?\nLooking up,\nhe kept watching.\nThe documentary was half an hour long,\nbut CCTV edited it to only five minutes for broadcast. However, on local news channels, especially when broadcast in police stations, the full version would definitely be shown.\nA long time ago,\nthe old Taoist priest said he envied Zhou Ze for being able to find the enemy who stole his ashes.\nMost people really wouldn't have this opportunity.\nYou're already ashes, how can you find your enemy?\nThis time,\nOld Zhang watched his own documentary, watched the memorial service video.\nFor a moment,\nhe was filled with emotion.\nMost people wouldn't have the chance to watch their own memorial service videos, would they?\nThe gloom in his heart dissipated a lot.\nEspecially when he saw the teachers and students presenting flowers to him at the memorial service,\nOld Zhang's eyes welled up with tears.\nHe was actually a very simple person, and also a very ordinary person. He simply loved his job and was fully committed to doing it.\nIf his current predicament and difficulties were a price he had to pay to save these lovely children,\nthen he, Zhang Yanfeng,\nhad no regrets!\nIt was time for dinner, and the guards distributed boxed meals.\nZhang Yanfeng picked up the meal box and continued watching the rerun of the documentary while eating.\nAfter a few bites,\nhe suddenly spat it out,\nnauseated,\nfeeling like throwing up,\ndisgusting!\nJust like the peanuts he ate in the pub before, he could only chew them, savor the aroma, and then spit them out, unable to swallow them at all.\n\"Heh!\"\nThe guard saw this and snorted contemptuously.\nMaking money as a drug dealer, huh?\nLiving a lavish life, huh?\nCan't even eat a boxed meal,\nHow pretentious,\nThe real prison food below is even worse.\nPutting down the meal box,\nZhang Yanfeng leaned against the bars.\nHe felt very hungry,\nbut he couldn't eat anything.\nThis feeling made him feel a little pained and uneasy.\nAt this moment, unbeknownst to Zhang Yanfeng, Zhou Ze and Lawyer An had arrived outside the police station.\n...\n\"Have you thought it through? Do you really want to break him out?\" Lawyer An asked. \"Although you're a ghost messenger, you're also a being from the dark side, and it's not advisable to have a head-on conflict with the agencies of the mortal world, especially this kind of agency.\"\nEverything,\nthere is a destined course in the dark.\nAlthough it seems to have no rules,\nit actually hides more terrifying rules.\nThis is like the censorship of some artistic works, without grading, without clear indicators and boundaries, it seems very lenient and free...\nBut conversely, it's also true.\nZhou Ze had also been to the police station several times before, but he had always been well-behaved and didn't dare to be reckless just because he wasn't human.\nBecause when you get close to here,\nclose to the national emblem,\nas an evil entity,\nyou can feel that pressure.\nBut at this moment, Zhou Ze felt that he had to brace himself and do it this time. There was no other way, he had to do it.\nHe had worked so hard to bring Old Zhang back to life,\nand if he just ended up in prison for life imprisonment, or was executed,\nthen was he helping Old Zhang or harming him?\nLawyer An rubbed his nose.\nIn fact, he was partly responsible for this mess. Although he seemed concerned at the time, he didn't put much effort into it, otherwise, he wouldn't have used the body of a criminal.\n\"Let's wait a bit longer. I'll handle the concealment, and you'll handle the lock picking. Try not to hurt anyone. After rescuing him, if there's a big loss, burn more paper money, and it should be fine.\nAfter all, that criminal is already dead, and Old Zhang is a heroic spirit, so he didn't break the law.\"\nLawyer An said, not sure if he was comforting himself.\nZhou Ze nodded,\nwait,\nuntil midnight.\n...\nMidnight,\nit arrived quickly.\nOld Zhang wanted to lean there and sleep,\nbut he couldn't sleep no matter how he tried.\nHe was clearly exhausted,\nclearly haggard,\nbut he just couldn't sleep.\nIt's strange,\nit's bad enough that he can't eat,\nbut now he can't even sleep.\nAt this moment,\nthere were suddenly hurried footsteps from outside,\nsoon,\nthe footsteps arrived at his cell door.\nZhang Yanfeng opened his eyes.\nWhat he saw,\nwas an old man in a police uniform. The old man's hair was silvery-gray, and two middle-aged police officers stood beside him.\n\"Open the door, hurry and open the door!!!\"\nThe old man shouted.\nZhang Yanfeng blinked,\nhe seemed to have seen the old man before.\nHe looked like a leader from another city bureau, whom he had seen at a conference. They had also clinked glasses at a celebration party for a criminal investigation activity organized by several city bureaus.\nAn old police officer, whom Old Zhang knew very well, the director of the Tongcheng Police Bureau, followed closely behind the old man.\nThe door was opened,\nthe old police officer immediately ran in,\ngrabbed Zhang Yanfeng's hands,\nand tears dripped down.\nHe choked out:\n\"Xiao Wu, you're still alive, you're still alive!!!\"\nThe old police officer hugged Zhang Yanfeng tightly while crying.\nZhang Yanfeng was completely bewildered.\n\"We all thought you had sacrificed yourself, because the information you transmitted from within the criminal group led to a successful sting operation.\nThe arrested criminals said you were killed by them, but we couldn't retrieve your body. We were worried that you were still in hiding, possibly with the escaped criminals, so we didn't dare to confirm your identity or announce your undercover mission.\nNow,\nyou're alive,\nyou're really alive,\nXiao Wu!!!\"\nThe old police officer patted Zhang Yanfeng's back vigorously.\n\"Your father and I are old comrades and brothers. I was really afraid, very afraid that you would really sacrifice yourself in this operation. How would I explain it to your father when I go down later!\"\nOld Zhang opened his mouth,\nand a surge of joy washed over him.\nI,\nam actually an undercover agent!\nI,\nam still a police officer!\n........\nThis is an extra chapter for 4,000 monthly votes!\nNow it's 4,800 monthly votes.\nI'll post the 5,000 monthly vote extra chapter tomorrow. I've written three chapters in a row, and I'm a bit tired, don't worry, I won't owe any debt!\nSo,\nmy dear departed souls,\nplease cast your monthly votes for me!",

    "content": "Zhang Yanfeng pushed open the bookstore door and walked in. The door wasn't closed; it was, after all, open for business.\n\nThe little loli sat behind the counter, a spoon in her hand, repeatedly pressing down on her tongue, as if pondering something while prodding it.\n\nShe had told Zhou Ze before that grim reapers couldn't cultivate, but that didn't mean their abilities couldn't be developed and explored on a deeper level.\n\nShe had personal experience with this.\n\nMore than half a year ago in Chengdu, the person who had been fleeing desperately from their group of grim reapers had returned less than a month later with that white cat to fight back. She still remembered that scene vividly.\n\nSo, the little loli, who had been struggling with her tongue, didn't notice Old Zhang had returned. Her subconscious had registered it, but she just assumed it was an employee of the bookstore returning, not a stranger, so she paid it no mind.\n\nThe old Daoist priest sat on the sofa, mending clothes for the little monkey with a needle and thread.\n\nThe little monkey was mischievous and loved to jump around, so its clothes often had holes or tears. If they could be mended, the old Daoist priest would tie them up and sew them.\n\nThe old Daoist priest had once known a nice lady who worked at a hair salon in the Port Gate District of Tongcheng. He often visited her. She was more skilled with her hands and had mended his Daoist robes twice for him.\n\nHer son was a bit slow, and her husband was lazy at home, too indolent to even farm. As a result, to maintain the family's livelihood and expenses, she had to take up this profession.\n\nLater, when her husband took her son to the river to bathe, they were caught by the tide, and both drowned.\n\nWhen the old Daoist priest went to find that nice lady again, a colleague told him that the lady had cried all night after hearing the news, and the next day she settled her accounts, packed her things, and went back to her maiden home.\n\nWhile thinking of her and mending the small garment in his hands,\n\nPerhaps,\n\nThis is youth,\n\nPerhaps,\n\nThis is life.\n\nHaving lived to seventy-one, though without children of his own, the old Daoist priest’s emotional life couldn't be described as dull. Others didn’t fancy him, and he had never interacted with so-called “club girls,” “models,” or “outsiders.”\n\nHe actually preferred the older ladies who worked in the service industry, earning a modest living.\n\nThey had common ground, and as fellow wanderers of the world, they could comfort each other.\n\nZhang Yanfeng walked up to the old Daoist priest. He wanted to ask the old Daoist priest what he should eat, because he couldn't stomach ordinary human food.\n\nHe also wanted to ask the old Daoist priest where he should sleep, because he seemed to realize he couldn't fall asleep at all.\n\nHe had declined the banquet, indicating he needed some time alone, and emerged from the back door of the police station, saying he just wanted some air.\n\nThe police leaders understood this. Having a fake identity and infiltrating a criminal organization was equivalent to experiencing a completely different life.\n\nNow that the undercover mission was successfully completed, emerging from it again caused a sense of disorientation.\n\nIt was like the Qing Dynasty, when people had to keep their hair or lose their heads; similarly, a group of people fought to the death for their queues. In the Republic of China era, when the police and military forcibly cut off queues on the streets, there were also groups of people who cried their hearts out over it.\n\nWhen one stays in a specific environment for too long, people develop inertia.\n\nOf course, this was what the police leaders thought. In reality, Zhang Yanfeng simply wanted to return to the bookstore to ask for more details and share his current joy with Zhou Ze.\n\nReturning to life, I am still a police officer. This was good news, the best possible news.\n\n\"Old Daoist, where's Zhou Ze?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\nHe had intended to ask, \"Where's Boss?\"\n\nBut then he thought better of it. The word \"Boss\" couldn't quite escape his lips. He was still a bit unaccustomed to it. Even though others in the bookstore called Zhou Ze \"Boss,\" Zhang Yanfeng was a bit thin-skinned.\n\n\"Oh, he went to the police station with Old An,\" the old Daoist priest replied without looking up.\n\n\"What's he doing at the police station?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"Rescuing you.\"\n\n\"Rescuing me?\"\n\n\"Yeah, didn't you get arrested? They were planning a jailbreak...\"\n\nAt this point,\n\nThe old Daoist priest suddenly looked up,\n\nLooking at Zhang Yanfeng in front of him, then he shrieked:\n\n\"Ahhhh!!!!\n\nHow did you get back!!!\"\n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"Quick, call Boss, quick, quick!\" the old Daoist priest immediately shouted towards the little loli at the counter.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, with the old Daoist priest's shout,\n\nThe little loli, who had been concentrating on prodding her tongue with the spoon, suddenly flinched. The spoon went directly in, performing a deep throat.\n\nThe little loli frantically banged on the counter with one hand while pulling the spoon out with the other, her entire small face turning red from the effort.\n\n\"Pop!\"\n\nFinally,\n\nThe spoon was pulled out by herself.\n\nThe little loli glared at the old Daoist priest and said in a low voice,\n\n\"Trying to rush to be reincarnated, are you!\"\n\n\"...\" The old Daoist priest.\n\nDespite the little loli's anger, the old Daoist priest could only give an awkward laugh. He immediately took out his phone and called Boss. The call was connected, and after explaining the situation, the line went dead.\n\nThe old Daoist priest let out a sigh of relief.\n\nIt seemed Boss and the others hadn't started the jailbreak yet.\n\nYes,\n\nBoss Zhou and Lawyer An were delayed for a period due to an incident. The reason seemed to be that a special event was starting in the evening and would end late at night. The nearby municipal bureau had also dispatched a considerable number of police forces, resulting in a constant stream of vehicles and double the number of police officers at the police station late at night.\n\nZhou Ze and Lawyer An could only wait patiently.\n\nZhou Ze also knew how to use illusion techniques similar to black mist, just like Lawyer An. However, it was safer when there were fewer people. If they encountered a few veteran detectives with strong auras, they might be seen through.\n\nBoss Zhou and Lawyer An, after all, intended to carry out a civilized jailbreak. It would be best to do it silently, rather than confronting the state's violent apparatus head-on.\n\nAs they waited, Old Daoist's call came.\n\nUpon hearing that Zhang Yanfeng had safely returned to the bookstore,\n\nZhou Ze and An Buqi exchanged glances,\n\nBoth saw the relief in the other's eyes.\n\nWhen they returned to the bookstore, it was already three or four in the morning. Zhang Yanfeng sat on the sofa, his eyes closed, but it was clear he couldn't sleep.\n\nZhou Ze walked in, instructed Yingying to pour him a cup of coffee, and then sat down in front of Old Zhang.\n\nOld Zhang opened his eyes, looked at Zhou Ze, and then smiled.\n\n\"I was undercover. Actually, I'm still a police officer.\"\n\n\"You're still a police officer?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not in Tongcheng, but in the neighboring Yancheng. I've been undercover for three years.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Zhou Ze then looked at Lawyer An beside him. \"So, the body you took was that of an undercover police officer. It wasn't an internal conflict; the undercover officer was discovered and killed.\"\n\nLawyer An shrugged. \"How would I know? But it's quite interesting to think about. A policeman dies, and then possesses another policeman. It's a kind of fate.\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nLawyer An patted Old Zhang on the shoulder.\n\n\"Two lives, both as police officers. Then you continue to be a police officer.\"\n\n\"I will try to apply for a transfer to Tongcheng, but that will take some time,\" Old Zhang said. \"And I'll have a long period of leave, so I can stay at the bookstore during this time.\"\n\n\"Mm, get used to life first. Tonight, let Old An teach you meditation. Those possessed by spirits can't sleep, and they find ordinary food difficult to accept. If you don't want to be infused with glucose every day, you can ask Old Xu to make you some plum juice tomorrow. Drink a large mouthful of plum juice before eating, and then you'll be able to suppress the nausea and eat.\"\n\nOld Zhang nodded, so that's how it was.\n\n\"Alright, today's business is done. We can close up and rest.\"\n\nBoss Zhou yawned, preparing to take a shower and go to bed.\n\nUnexpectedly, a customer arrived from outside at this moment, and it was an acquaintance, Zhang Feng.\n\nSeeing his son approach, Old Zhang remembered the old man from last night and immediately stood up in fright.\n\n\"My son... my son...\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at him and comforted him, \"He's not dead, he's alive.\"\n\nOld Zhang breathed a sigh of relief, reassured.\n\nHe had truly been worried that something had happened to his son and he had come to be reincarnated.\n\n\"Boss Zhou, are you in?\" Zhang Feng pushed the door open and asked.\n\nHe actually came looking for them?\n\nZhou Ze remembered Zhang Feng mentioning that his father had told him he had kept a notebook in the home safe.\n\n\"Old Daoist, attend to our guest.\"\n\nZhou Ze, too lazy to deal with this fellow, went upstairs before the other party could recognize him as the doctor.\n\nThe old Daoist priest immediately came over, served tea, and explained their minimum consumption. Zhang Feng wasn't stingy about this; he paid the money upfront.\n\n\"Boss isn't here. If you have anything you need, you can tell him.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest pointed to Zhang Yanfeng, who was sitting nearby.\n\nZhang Yanfeng also got up at this moment and sat in front of his son.\n\nThe two sat there awkwardly.\n\nYoung Zhang said nothing,\n\nOld Zhang said nothing.\n\nYoung Zhang was apprehensive about the description of the bookstore recorded in the notebook left by his father.\n\nWhen he first read the notebook, he thought his father had just watched a supernatural movie or read a novel and written a story out of interest.\n\nBut then he thought that given his father's artistic flair, he was unlikely to bother with such a thing.\n\nSo, with a heart full of apprehension, he had come to the door.\n\nOld Zhang, on the other hand, was unsure of how he should face his son, whether to tell him the truth or to conceal it.\n\nBefore he could ask Zhou Ze about this, Zhou Ze had already left.\n\nThe two Zhangs stared at each other,\n\nAs they watched,\n\nOld Zhang's eyes welled up. He reached out to wipe away his tears, but more kept coming.\n\nSeeing Old Zhang cry, Young Zhang, not knowing why, also started crying.\n\nThey sat facing each other,\n\nSaying nothing,\n\nWiping their tears vigorously.\n\nOld Zhang looked at Young Zhang in confusion,\n\nWhy are you crying?\n\nYoung Zhang also looked at Old Zhang in confusion,\n\nWhy are you crying?\n\nThe little loli crossed her legs and whispered to the old Daoist priest beside her, \"Identities revealed?\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest shook his head.\n\n\"Then why are they crying?\"\n\n\"Performance art, I've seen it before,\" the old Daoist priest said.",

    "content": "\"Hey, Xiaorong, it's time to go. First period is Mao Zedong Thought class, and that teacher loves to take attendance.\"\n\n\"No, no, let me sleep a bit longer.\" The girl, wrapped in her blanket, turned over, showing no intention of getting out of bed.\n\n\"You've already been marked absent twice. If you get marked absent again, you'll fail the course at the end of the semester.\"\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine. I heard from a senior that the teacher is quite a lecher. I'll treat him to a meal at the end of the semester, and it'll be okay.\"\n\nThe girl continued to sleep.\n\nSeeing this, the other girls in the dorm took their books and left for class.\n\nGenerally speaking, students are most diligent in their first year of university, still carrying the inertia of high school study habits. By their sophomore and junior years, they've basically become old hands, and skipping class has become the norm.\n\nAfter more than an hour passed, the girl lying on the bed finally woke up, rubbed her eyes, and got out of bed.\n\nWithout brushing her teeth or washing her face, she first looked in the mirror at her pores and blackheads. Then, she picked up her roommate's cosmetics and started applying them liberally. She used a lot, since it was someone else's, and she didn't feel any guilt.\n\nWhile applying makeup, she received a message on her phone. She walked over, picked up her phone, and saw a message from one of her roommates' boyfriends.\n\nA smile played on her lips. She eagerly chatted with him and even took a selfie. She said she wasn't feeling well and, of course, didn't show her face, as she hadn't washed her hair yet. Instead, she took a picture of her bed, incidentally including her legs.\n\nThe person on the other end immediately offered to treat her to a meal and expressed concern for her well-being.\n\nShe yawned,\n\ntossed her phone aside,\n\nand then opened another roommate's closet, starting to use their things. Many of the skincare and beauty products were bought with her roommate's hard-earned money, which the roommate usually used sparingly. She, however, was indifferent. She used them up mercilessly, like she used to smear urea cream on her face as a child.\n\nA gust of wind blew in,\n\nmaking her shiver.\n\nShe looked towards the door with some confusion, finding it closed. The window was also shut. Where had the wind come from?\n\nShe found some clothes to change into. She hadn't showered in three days and was too lazy to go, as there was no shower in the dorm. To shower, she had to go to the public bathhouse, which was a bit far, and she was too lazy to go. She usually only showered when she stayed over at a boyfriend's place.\n\nPreparing to remove a facial mask, she walked to the sink and, looking in the mirror, took off the mask.\n\nTo her shock, she discovered a small dark spot near the corner of her eye.\n\nShe frowned. She didn't think it was there before.\n\nAlthough the dark spot was small, it made her feel uncomfortable. She tried washing it with facial cleanser, thinking she might have gotten something dirty on it.\n\nThis roommate said she bought this Korean mask online with a month's worth of savings from her part-time job. Could there be something wrong with it?\n\nThat idiot, buying a fake and tricking me!\n\nShe started to rub it, but as she rubbed, she noticed the dark spot seemed to be expanding.\n\nHer eyes widened, and she rubbed even more frantically. The dark spot began to grow larger, and she looked at herself in the mirror in horror, rubbing harder and harder.\n\nRubbing and rubbing,\n\ngetting bigger and bigger,\n\nthe more she rubbed, the bigger the dark spot became,\n\nthe more she rubbed, the more dark spots appeared,\n\nuntil half of her face turned dark.\n\nShe screamed,\n\nlike a madwoman, she grabbed all sorts of skincare products from her roommates, smearing them all over her face regardless of whether they worked. Then, she desperately washed her face with water. Seeing that it was useless, she took a toothbrush and started scrubbing her face. The toothbrush was also useless. She grabbed a shoe brush that her roommates used for cleaning shoes and began scrubbing her face with it.\n\nHer skin was abraded,\n\nblood began to flow,\n\nbut she laughed with excitement,\n\nthinking that by scrubbing off this dirty skin,\n\nnew, tender skin would grow.\n\nShe continued to scrub forcefully, laughing all the while,\n\nrubbing,\n\nrubbing,\n\nrubbing...\n\n...\n\n\"Hey, wanna go to the internet cafe?\"\n\n\"Nah, dinner's almost ready.\"\n\n\"Damn, you've been eating snacks non-stop since noon, and you still want to eat?\"\n\n\"Yeah, this isn't enough.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, we're heading out then.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, I'll order delivery.\"\n\nAfter her roommates left,\n\nhe continued to munch on potato chips while watching anime on his laptop. He had already ordered dinner through a delivery app, and it should arrive soon.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nthe dormitory suddenly lost power.\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\nHe angrily tapped his desk.\n\nIt was evening, and the school had evening study sessions. The power outage was from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM, which was why his roommates chose to go to the internet cafe to play games instead of staying in the dorm.\n\nHe lay on the bed helplessly, picked up a drink, and took a sip.\n\nHe took out his phone to check the time.\n\nWhy hadn't his delivery arrived yet?\n\nA bad review, a bad review!\n\nMaking me starve!\n\nAt that moment,\n\nhe jumped off the bed. He had finished all the snacks, and the delivery still hadn't arrived, but his stomach felt unusually hungry, a hunger more intense than usual.\n\nHe rummaged through his roommates' belongings and found some snacks. The roommates had a good relationship, so taking their things and paying them back later was fine. No one would say anything.\n\nHowever, half an hour later, he had eaten all of his roommates' snacks, yet he still felt hungry.\n\nSo hungry,\n\nso hungry it hurt his stomach.\n\nDamn this delivery, why hasn't it arrived yet?\n\nBecause the dorm was without power, the only light in the room came from the dim glow of the laptop. He sat on the edge of the bed, his gaze somewhat unfocused.\n\nHe wanted to leave the dorm to buy food at a nearby supermarket or even eat at an outdoor restaurant. But as he decided to open the dorm door, he found it locked.\n\nHe banged on the door forcefully,\n\nshouted loudly,\n\nbut no one responded.\n\nHe shouted and knocked for a long time.\n\nHe became even hungrier.\n\nHe tried to eat other things,\n\nlike paper,\n\nlike his belt,\n\nbut he couldn't eat them.\n\nHe really couldn't eat them anymore.\n\nHe went to drink water,\n\nhoping to fill his stomach with water,\n\nbut the more he drank, the stronger the hunger became.\n\nHe knelt on the floor silently,\n\nand then,\n\nhis gaze fell on his hand.\n\nWhat a fat hand,\n\nwhat a thick hand...\n\n...\n\nIn the beautiful morning,\n\nOld Xu, after making breakfast, returned to his room to practice his talisman-making and horse stance.\n\nOld Daoist went out again to buy weasels, and he still needed to buy a water snake. These things were relatively difficult to obtain. Money was secondary; the key was that even with money, they were hard to find.\n\nThe little loli sat behind the bar, playing with her tongue with a silver chopstick, while simultaneously recording something with a pen. Truly, the bookshop had a skillful tongue.\n\nDeadpool sat in a corner,\n\na tablet placed in front of him.\n\nThe tablet was playing Naruto. It was something Lawyer An had him watch.\n\nDeadpool watched, mimicking the hand seals of the characters and mumbling similar Japanese phrases.\n\nOld Zhang held a sour plum drink in one hand and chopsticks in the other, struggling with his breakfast.\n\nHe looked at Zhou Ze, who had finished his soy milk and fried dough sticks with ease, and asked in surprise, \"How did you do it?\"\n\n\"Only those who endure hardships can be superior to others.\"\n\nZhou Ze gave Old Zhang a dose of motivational talk,\n\nthen sat down at his favorite window seat.\n\nYingying brought coffee and the newspaper,\n\nand replaced the fresh flowers in the vase on the coffee table.\n\nA salty fish's day,\n\nhad begun!\n\n\"Where's Lawyer An?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHe hadn't seen him since early morning.\n\n\"He said he went out to talk business. He originally wanted to knock on your door to ask you to join him, but I refused. I wanted boss to sleep a little longer.\"\n\n\"Good job.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Yingying's head.\n\nThe sunlight shone on his body.\n\nBoss Zhou leaned back, lounging like Ge You,\n\npicked up the newspaper,\n\nand casually flipped through it.\n\nThe newspaper contained several news articles.\n\nTwo news items caught Zhou Ze's attention.\n\nTwo days ago, at Tongcheng University, two university students died unexpectedly.\n\nThe school authorities initially intended to suppress the news from spreading, but with two deaths at once, it was really difficult to keep it under wraps. Moreover, with the current development of new media, everyone had an innate instinct for being a reporter, and the news spread like wildfire.\n\nHowever, the newspaper's report was brief, and it was likely that the newspaper itself didn't know the specific details of what happened.\n\n\"Boss, it's all over Weibo,\" Yingying said, walking over when she saw Zhou Ze looking at the news.\n\n\"What's all over Weibo?\"\n\n\"This woman, it's said she tore her own face off in her dorm. When she was discovered, she was lying on the dorm floor, her face covered in blood, not a piece of good flesh left. She died a horrible death.\n\nAs for this man, it's said he bit off his own flesh and ate it.\"\n\n\"That's too outrageous,\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"Her roommates and people in nearby dorms have posted on Weibo, claiming that after the police sealed off the scene, even the forensic doctors couldn't handle such a gruesome sight.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, I get it.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't take it seriously.\n\nIn a school,\n\nthe death of one student is normal. Two dying at the same time, well, the probability is a bit low, but it's not entirely incomprehensible.\n\nAs for the superstitious things being spread, Zhou Ze didn't really believe them.\n\nMany people instinctively exaggerate when spreading information to gain satisfaction and attention. Such acts of seeking eyeballs are really commonplace on Weibo.\n\n\"It seems... not fake news,\" Zhang Yanfeng, who was still wrestling with his breakfast, interjected.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"Look at this,\" Zhang Yanfeng handed his phone to Zhou Ze.\n\nIt was a police WeChat group.\n\nSomeone in the group had posted photos from the scene,\n\nbloody,\n\ngruesome,\n\nand unbearable to look at. It was an internal WeChat group for the Tongcheng police department, where they discussed cases and so on.\n\n\"It's true?\" Bai Yingying's mouth formed an \"O\" shape.\n\n\"What are your thoughts?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's expression became solemn as he clicked the screen to exit the WeChat group,\n\nrealizing that it was logged in with Zhang Yanfeng's WeChat account.\n\n\"Your account, it can still be used?\"\n\n\"As long as I don't post anything, they won't kick me out of the group, even if I 'sacrifice' myself.\n\nBy the way, this case really doesn't seem like it was done by a human. There's a lot of weirdness to it, and two incidents happening in one day.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"No, that's a minor matter. Put it aside for now,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Uh, then what's the major matter?\"\n\n\"The major matter is, why can your past life's account still be logged in?\"",

    "content": "\"The important thing is, why can you log into your account from your past life?\"\n\nBoss Zhou clearly remembered that when he returned to life, he spent an entire afternoon trying to log into his old social media accounts, but to no avail.\n\nEither he was told to reapply for a phone card or to undergo friend verification, neither of which was feasible.\n\nNow, Old Zhang could directly use his old WeChat,\n\nmaking Boss Zhou feel very unbalanced.\n\n\"Uh, I found this in my belongings,\" Zhang Yanfeng replied.\n\n\"Belongings?\"\n\n\"Yes, I went home. After my son came to the bookstore the day before yesterday, he went back to school, so I went home and brought my phone over.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. So that's how it was.\n\nBut he still felt unhappy.\n\n\"Do you need to look into this matter?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\nHis current life, his current situation, still made Old Zhang a little unaccustomed, but as long as there was a case to handle and investigate, he could immediately become full of vitality, and even life could become hopeful again.\n\n\"Forget it, didn't you say yesterday that you planned to take some time to go back to Yancheng to see your family? Although the owner of this body doesn't have children, he still has a mother. Since you're using someone else's body, fulfill your filial duty for them.\n\nHe was also a good cop, and you,\n\nyou've both had a tough time.\"\n\nOld Zhang fell silent upon hearing this, then nodded.\n\nCops understood cops better. With twenty years in the criminal investigation career, he had many fallen comrades. He understood this kind of bleakness.\n\n\"Okay, I'll head back this afternoon then.\" Old Zhang decided.\n\n\"Go to the counter and get some money, and also take some ghost money. If you encounter trouble, you can burn some ghost money.\"\n\n\"Okay, got it.\"\n\n\"I'll make time to go to the school this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nOld Zhang sat back down, engrossed in his battle with breakfast.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, held Old Zhang's phone, repeatedly looking at those few pictures.\n\nThe scenes were very bloody,\n\nvery brutal,\n\nno wonder the newspapers dared not publish crime scene photos.\n\nThe successive deaths of two university students in one day should be a major event. Zhou Ze's original intention was to observe first and see the police's investigation results.\n\nIf the police locked onto a suspect and confirmed it was a human act, he could then rest and not interfere.\n\nHowever, Boss Zhou also worried that if it was indeed the work of ghosts, and he let it go unmanaged, leading to another death, he might bear some responsibility.\n\nFurthermore, in the incident of the escaped evil spirits last time, Zhou Ze earned a lot of merit points. He was only three hundred points away from reaching the milestone of one thousand merit points. After catching a few more evil spirits to fill the gap, he would only need to catch a few more useless ghost marshals like Liu Chuyu to be promoted to Constable.\n\nOrdinary small fry were only enough to nibble on, but these major cases, these big fish, could ignite Zhou Xianyu's initiative.\n\nAfter noon,\n\nOld Zhang drove Xu Qinglang's Nissan to Yancheng.\n\nWatching the car disappear from his sight,\n\nZhou Ze felt a touch of envy for Old Zhang.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nthis was retribution?\n\nHere, retribution was no longer a derogatory term.\n\nA hero in his past life,\n\nand in this life, he could simply borrow a corpse and return to life, and he was still a hero.\n\nUnlike inheriting Xu Le's body,\n\nZhou Ze felt no guilt towards Xu Le.\n\nReplacing his identity, replacing his life, this could only be considered a cycle of karma.\n\nHowever, Old Zhang held a special respect and affection for his body. The other party had spent three years undercover, finally relaying information that led to the success of the sting operation, even sacrificing himself for it. Such an unsung hero was truly admirable.\n\nSince he inherited the other person's body, he naturally had to bear the burden of his family as well.\n\nThe only fortunate thing was that the other party was not married and had no children, which saved a lot of trouble.\n\nHe didn't have to bear any ethical or moral burdens.\n\nOutside, the wind began to blow. Zhou Ze yawned, pulling himself out of his thoughts. He turned sideways, looking at the little loli still examining the tongue, and called out,\n\n\"Link, stop playing with the tongue and come with me.\"\n\n...\n\nTongcheng University was not a prestigious school, unrelated to the \"211\" or \"985\" projects, but it was still the best university in Tongcheng locally. Its medical school had a decent overall strength.\n\nAfter entering the school, Zhou Ze tried to find the dormitory where the incident occurred. After circling twice, he finally found it in a more secluded area, not within the original dormitory zone.\n\nIt was said to have been to make space for international students, and the local students who originally lived there were assigned to the old dormitory area.\n\nBoth cases occurred in the old dormitory area.\n\nFor the girls' dormitory, Zhou Ze asked Link to check the situation, while he went into the boys' dormitory himself.\n\nAlthough a murder had occurred, at most, that particular dormitory would not be occupied this year. The other dormitories in the building were still normally occupied.\n\nOtherwise, with thousands of students, it wouldn't be easy to temporarily arrange alternative accommodation.\n\nOf course,\n\neven after people had died,\n\nafter a year or two, naive juniors and seniors would definitely move in. Unused resources were also a waste, weren't they?\n\nA police seal was posted on the dormitory door. Students with basins and foot basins walked by from time to time, but as they passed the sealed door, they visibly quickened their pace.\n\nBoss Zhou tore off the seal and walked in.\n\nSome students saw him, but assuming he was someone from the police or school staff sent for investigation, no one came forward to inquire.\n\nHe closed the door,\n\ncarefully observed the dormitory.\n\nThe bodies had long been removed and transferred. Many items inside had been taken as evidence. The belongings of the other roommates must also have been taken.\n\nOnly the deceased's bedding and personal items were still in place.\n\nThis dormitory faced the sun and had good ventilation. Moreover, inside, Zhou Ze detected no residual ghostly energy or resentment.\n\nAfter confirming there were no other discoveries, Zhou Ze pushed open the dormitory door, re-hung the seal, and turned to leave when he saw a youth in shorts and a t-shirt, holding a basketball, standing in front of him, looking at him with a scrutinizing gaze.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the other person asked.\n\nZhou Ze ignored him and turned to leave.\n\nHowever, the other person suddenly threw the basketball at Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze reacted faster. The physical collapses and paralysis after the many berserk states in his past life were actually more like \"body tempering\" in Wuxia novels. At least, his physical fitness had improved significantly compared to the sickly Xu Le before.\n\nHe turned, waved his hand, and the basketball was batted away.\n\nBut the youth lunged forward again, directly tackling Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew slightly, and he instinctively wanted to stab into the other person's body, but he hesitated for a moment.\n\nIn that hesitation, Zhou Ze was directly knocked to the ground by the youth.\n\nThe other person reached out and grabbed Zhou Ze's collar, roaring,\n\n\"Who are you!\"\n\n\"Police,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Nonsense, I grew up in a police compound since I was a child, and I don't recognize you!\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a little helpless.\n\nHe had encountered a second-generation cop.\n\nThe commotion here immediately attracted the attention of other students. Seeing people fighting, a crowd of onlookers quickly gathered.\n\n\"Sorry, many criminals have the habit of returning to their crime scenes to observe. I'm going to call the police now and send you to the police station. If I wrongly accuse you, I will apologize and also provide you with financial compensation!\"\n\nBecause Zhou Ze had falsely claimed to be a police officer, it intensified the youth's suspicion. He signaled to his companions to hold Zhou Ze while taking out his phone and making a call.\n\n...\n\nThe little loli walked out of the girls' dormitory building. She had entered that dormitory and found nothing unusual. As she waited below for Zhou Ze to come down, she saw Zhou Ze being escorted out of the dormitory by a group of students.\n\nUpon seeing this, the little loli was stunned.\n\nEven,\n\nshe playfully waved at the boss and stuck out her tongue.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the gloating little loli.\n\nThe police car arrived quickly. By the time Zhou Ze was escorted to the school gate, a police car had already stopped there.\n\n\"Xiaofeng, what's wrong?\"\n\nA female police officer got out of the police car.\n\nShe was tall and thin,\n\nlike a stick.\n\n\"Sister, I caught someone who tore off a seal and secretly entered the crime scene, and he lied to me, saying he was a police officer.\"\n\nThe female police officer immediately looked at Zhou Ze and then was stunned, exclaiming,\n\n\"Mr. Xu?\"\n\n...\n\n\"I'm very sorry, Mr. Xu, it was my fault, I was too rash.\" The young student named Zhou Feng stood up from his seat and bowed to Zhou Ze, apologizing.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, indicating it was alright.\n\nThe arriving female police officer was actually an acquaintance.\n\nWhen Old Zhang had asked Zhou Ze to handle cases before, he had asked this female police officer to drive Zhou Ze back more than once.\n\nZhou Ze was, in name, still an advisor to the police bureau, but Old Zhang, who had hired him, was no longer around.\n\nBut at least this identity could temporarily clear Zhou Ze of suspicion of being the murderer.\n\n\"Mr. Xu, are you interested in this case?\" the female police officer asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Mm, Old Zhang dreamt and told me, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to come and look into this case, so I came.\"\n\nThe female police officer and the youth did not think Zhou Ze was joking or being sarcastic. They thought Zhou Ze was deeply saddened by Old Zhang's sacrifice and was using this tone to hide his grief.\n\n\"I would like to help investigate this case, can I?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uh, you can, but I need to apply to the higher-ups. This case is really tricky right now, and there are no clues at all from what we can see.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said, \"Can you tell me about the victims specifically? For example, their personalities, living habits, and recent changes. You don't need to reveal internal investigation clues, I know it's inconvenient for you.\"\n\nWhen Old Zhang was around before,\n\nthere was no inconvenience at all.\n\nOld Zhang wished he could have brought Zhou Ze, the ghost, around like Detective Conan to help him solve cases.\n\nConfidential files only stipulated that they could not be revealed to unrelated individuals,\n\nbut they did not stipulate that they could not be revealed to unrelated ghosts.\n\n\"Mr. Xu, if you want to know this, I can tell you,\" Zhou Feng said.\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Because the deceased, Liu Haonan, was my roommate. I moved out of that dormitory after he died.\n\nLiu Haonan,\n\nhe was also my good friend.\"\n\n...\n\nThis is the extra chapter for five thousand monthly votes.\n\nAlso,\n\nthere is a \"Heartbeat Character\" event in the activity zone on Qidian.\n\nThe most popular character in the bookhouse is not Zhou Ze, but Bai Yingying...\n\nYingying is currently ranked 24th.

    "content": "\"Liu Haonan isn't from Tongcheng. He's from...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nI keep thinking, if only I'd dragged him out to the internet cafe to play games that night by insisting on treating him to late-night snacks, maybe he wouldn't have been murdered in the dorm by the killer.\"\n\nIn the teahouse, Zhou Feng said with tears in his eyes. It seemed his relationship with Liu Haonan was indeed good, and he was genuinely saddened by Liu Haonan's death. His earlier act of apprehending Zhou Ze for trespassing into the crime scene was likely driven by a desire to avenge his good friend.\n\n\"Mr. Xu, I've finished. Do you think this will help you analyze the case and find the killer?\" Zhou Feng looked at Zhou Ze expectantly. He had revealed all the details he could. He knew the gap between himself and a true detective and since this Mr. Xu was invited by the late Captain Zhang Yanfeng to be a police consultant, he must be a formidable detective.\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of tea and glanced at the setting sun outside. They had been talking for so long, it was almost evening.\n\n\"Potentially, Mr. Xu?\" Zhou Feng continued to ask.\n\n\"Mmm...\" Zhou Ze paused, then noticed the young man still looking at him expectantly. \"Basically, no.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Feng.\n\n\"Alright, your school has evening classes, doesn't it? Go to evening classes.\" Zhou Ze stood up, preparing to leave. Frankly, the daily life details of a dead shut-in weren't very engaging. If Yingying were with him, Zhou Ze might have actually fallen asleep while listening to the young man's narration. In Zhou Ze's opinion, patiently listening to a youth recount his story with tears in his eyes was the greatest care he could offer the nation's youth.\n\n\"This...\" Zhou Feng hadn't expected such an evaluation after talking for almost half the afternoon.\n\n\"Oh, right, did you bring money? Let's settle the bill,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, okay, Mr. Xu.\" Zhou Feng, somewhat dejected, took out his wallet and paid at the counter, then left the teahouse in a daze.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, let out a heavy yawn, took out his phone, and dialed the little loli. \"Hello, where are you?\"\n\n\"I'm at the bookstore.\"\n\n\"You went home alone without waiting for me?\"\n\n\"Do you know what time it is? Who knows where you went gallivanting off to.\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to hang up, his Ghost Messenger ID suddenly vibrated. He took it out and glanced at it. The ID was glowing blue. Opening it, a photo and a name appeared on the latest page. The photo showed a middle-aged man with a gaunt face and vacant eyes. The name was Gu He. Most importantly, the job title at the bottom read: Head Constable.\n\nHmm, a Ghost Head Constable? Isn't that the position he wanted to be promoted to next?\n\n\"Did you receive the summons?\" The little loli on the other end of the phone had clearly looked at her own Ghost Messenger ID.\n\n\"What is this?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A Head Constable is issuing a summons, calling nearby Ghost Messengers for assistance. I think it's probably related to this incident.\"\n\n\"Like last time you went to Rongcheng?\"\n\n\"Something like that.\" Such summons were like a signal flare, drawing a vast army. Of course, it also depended on the Head Constable's popularity. A Head Constable who was good at managing people and relationships would likely attract more people, as there was a concept of \"favors\" among Ghost Messengers. And if it was a Head Constable with outstanding abilities and strength, even if they weren't good at social interaction, they could still summon many Ghost Messengers, as everyone knew they could gain something by following him. As for those who were useless Ghost Head Constables, they would probably be ignored by everyone except their direct subordinates.\n\n\"It seems this matter isn't simple,\" the little loli said on the phone.\n\n\"Only one of us needs to go, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Whether you go or not is just a matter of intent. Sending one is already showing him respect.\"\n\n\"Then you go, I want to go back and rest.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll head out in a bit. Your Ghost Messenger ID has two dots on the back, one red and one blue. The blue dot represents our own location, and the red dot represents the summoner's location. It's like a radar; just follow it.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his Ghost Messenger ID over and looked at it, then said somewhat surprised, \"Why does my back only have one blue dot?\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone. The little loli coughed twice and said, \"It means the blue dot perfectly covers the red dot, meaning the Head Constable summoning nearby Ghost Messengers is in the same location as you, boss.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, since you're already here, I won't go then. Bye-bye.\" The call ended, ended surprisingly and decisively, as if she were afraid Zhou Ze would say \"no.\" Actually, it wasn't that the little loli was lazy. She used to be quite enthusiastic about participating in such gatherings and undertaking missions with other Ghost Messengers. Such missions were usually safe, and everyone could earn a lot of merit points, which was much more profitable than waiting at home for ghosts to appear and getting only a tiny bit of reward. But after the incident in Rongcheng, the little loli had witnessed a group of Ghost Messengers killing each other and perishing before her eyes. She felt a bit traumatized and resistant to this now.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to find an excuse not to go because he was lazy. He was lazy to socialize with external Ghost Messengers, lazy to get to know the so-called Head Constables. After staying home for too long, being a bookstore owner for too long, and being the king of his own small world, he developed a sense of social aversion. But there was really no excuse. The Head Constable who issued the summons was in the same teahouse where he was currently. How could he possibly say he was going back and asking the little loli to switch shifts when they were so close?\n\nHolding his Ghost Messenger ID, he closed his eyes and sensed it. Zhou Ze walked step by step towards the private room. He stopped at the door of a private room, reached out, and pushed the door open. Inside the private room sat two men and one woman. The gaunt man named Gu He, wearing a white jacket, sat on a chair with his eyes closed, his expression stern. The man and woman next to him looked quite young. One, wearing a blue dress and looking like a university student, was peeling an orange; the other was leaning back, engrossed in playing a mobile game. As Zhou Ze entered, the man and woman beside him looked at Zhou Ze with confusion. Gu He also opened his eyes and looked at Zhou Ze, then smiled, \"Quite good at concealing your aura.\"\n\nYes, at first, the man and woman, both Ghost Messengers, hadn't detected that Zhou Ze was also a Ghost Messenger. Because of the pen inside Zhou Ze, although its main function now was to suppress that consciousness, it also had a good effect on concealing Zhou Ze's aura. The main reason, however, was that after witnessing Lawyer An's method of concealing his aura last time, Zhou Ze had Lawyer An make a poker card for him as well, to seal his aura from leaking. Because it was too embarrassing before. Others could tell at a glance that he was a ghost or a Ghost Messenger, but he couldn't tell if someone he ate with or brushed past was human or ghost. This Ghost Messenger was too frustrating. At least for now, the effect was good.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over the three people inside, and he found an empty seat nearby and sat down. Without introducing himself or greeting them, he just sat there with his legs crossed. The two Ghost Messengers beside him eyed Zhou Ze curiously. Even Gu He, the Head Constable, looked at Zhou Ze a few more times, coughed twice, and said, \"Let's introduce ourselves. I'm Gu He, a Head Constable from Hangzhou.\"\n\n\"Yueya, Ghost Messenger from Suzhou.\"\n\n\"Li Sen, Ghost Messenger from Wuxi.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he understood. The other three present were stunned. Why was he nodding? Damn, who was the superior and who was the subordinate? They had all introduced themselves, what about him?\n\nZhou Ze, realizing this belatedly, finally spoke, \"Zhou Ze, Ghost Messenger from Tongcheng.\"\n\nGu He smiled and nodded, saying, \"There's one more, who should be arriving soon.\" As soon as he finished speaking, the private room door was pushed open again, and a tall guy walked in. The tall guy was about 1.9 meters tall, wearing a basketball jersey and basketball shoes, and holding a basketball.\n\n\"Oh, so many people have arrived. I'm Zheng Qiang, a Ghost Messenger from Huaian.\"\n\n\"That's about enough.\" Gu He stood up, scanned the four Ghost Messengers present, and said in a deep voice, \"If any other Ghost Messengers receive the summons and are willing to come, that's another matter. For now, I will explain the reason for this Head Constable summoning you all. I believe that, apart from Ghost Messenger Zhou from Tongcheng, everyone else has been tracking that ghost to Tongcheng.\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyebrows twitched slightly. As expected, the Ghost Messengers from Wuxi, Suzhou, and Huaian must have arrived in Tongcheng before, otherwise, they couldn't have rushed over so quickly after Gu He summoned them. They couldn't fly that fast.\n\n\"That ghost is a bit tricky because it can release and amplify certain desires within the human body, such as greed, anger, ignorance, hatred, and so on. It has been roaming in several places. This time, it has appeared in Tongcheng, and we must intercept it. As for the merit points, it will be allocated based on work, and it will be recorded on the Yin Division's Ghost Messenger ID. Do any of you have any objections?\"\n\nIt's a ghost committing crimes across multiple locations, a joint arrest operation by multiple areas. The methods of the Yin Division's Ghost Messengers are really similar to the police in the living world.\n\n\"Is it really just a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"At least, it's a ghost. What exactly it is, we can only determine after we catch it.\"\n\n\"Is its current location sealed off?\" Zheng Qiang, holding the basketball, asked.\n\n\"Yes, it's still in Tongcheng University. Last night, Head Constable Gu He and I set up barriers at the two main entrances and three side entrances of Tongcheng University. We can confirm that thing is still within the school.\"\n\n\"Sealed inside the university?\" Zhou Ze frowned. Isn't that forcing that thing to continue causing trouble in the university?\n\n\"Yes, we're waiting for it to make another move. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to sense it. Alright, everyone, tonight we will all lie in wait in the school, and when it makes a move on its next prey, we will capture it.\"\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to ask if sealing a ghost that had committed serial murders inside a university wasn't too big a price to pay. But Yueya beside him suddenly nudged Zhou Ze's arm and whispered, \"It is said that Head Constable Gu He failed his college entrance examination in his previous life.\"\n\n...\n\nOn the \"Most Liked Character\" list, Yingying, representing our bookstore, has ranked ninth!

    "content": "Here's how to distinguish the operational principles of Ghost Messengers from those of real police officers: one can clearly see the difference by looking at their response measures.\n\nThe police would never force criminals into a densely populated university and then wait for the murderer to strike again before apprehending them.\n\nAlthough the term \"university student\" has been devalued by the continuous expansion of universities over the years, a \"university student\" still instantly captures public attention in any news report.\n\nHowever, Ghost Messengers lack this concept. They don't care if people get sacrificed; their goal is simply to contain the impact of supernatural events as much as possible.\n\nEven if something were to kill another person in the university, as long as they can catch it and prevent it from causing further harm, they would consider their duty fulfilled.\n\nIt's hard to tell a slaughterhouse worker how cute and adorable the pigs are.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nIt's hard to make a Ghost Messenger, who deals with souls every day, understand the meaning of \"human life is precious.\"\n\nWhether they are university students or beggars, in the eyes of most Ghost Messengers, there's no difference; after death, everyone is just merit points.\n\nNight has fallen,\n\nBut the university is still bustling with people.\n\nFor the students,\n\nNightlife\n\nhas just begun.\n\nOn the illuminated sports field, Zheng Qiang is playing basketball with a few university students. He truly enjoys playing basketball.\n\nZhou Ze sits on a bench by the sports field, with Yue Ya next to him.\n\nGu He and the person named Li Sen are at the gymnasium, not nearby.\n\nWhat they need to do now is to do nothing at all;\n\nThey have to wait for the entity to be unable to suppress its instincts and act on its prey again before they can pinpoint its exact location.\n\n\"Want some?\"\n\nYue Ya offers her half-finished milk tea to Zhou Ze. It's taro-flavored and has ice.\n\nZhou Ze shakes his head.\n\n\"You don't like my used straw?\"\n\nYue Ya asks, gently stroking her hair by her earlobe with a smile. Normally, when a girl says this, a guy would be embarrassed to refuse and would take a sip.\n\nBut,\n\nZhou Ze nods.\n\n\"...\" Yue Ya.\n\nThe conversation has stalled.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sweeps around. Although he knows it's a futile effort, given the vastness of the university, what he can see now is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHowever, if he could detect the entity's traces earlier and catch it sooner, a living life might be protected.\n\nIt's not that Boss Zhou is overly compassionate;\n\nIt's just that for good deeds within his capabilities,\n\nWhat's the harm in doing them?\n\nZheng Qiang sinks a three-pointer, ending the mini-game. A few university students invite him to get some barbecue, but he declines.\n\nHe walks over, picks up Yue Ya's milk tea, tears open the seal, and gulps it down directly.\n\n\"Ah, refreshing!\"\n\nZheng Qiang looks at Yue Ya, then at Zhou Ze beside her, and laughs:\n\n\"Do you bring your assistant on missions too?\"\n\nYue Ya glances at Zheng Qiang. \"None of your business?\"\n\n\"If you want to flirt, flirt with my type. What good are these pretty boys compared to my stamina?\"\n\n\"Scram.\"\n\n\"Haha.\"\n\n\"Don't think I don't know you died of a drug overdose in your past life.\"\n\n\"Then don't think I don't know you were an over-fifties woman in your past life. Why are you acting young this time? If you want to play, you should really find me. Anyway, our bodies are a perfect match. Don't overthink things, just focus on release, and it'll be fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze, sitting nearby, recalls a photo he saw in a magazine.\n\nIn the photo, a man and a woman are kissing.\n\nThe man is thinking: \"Artificial beauty?\"\n\nThe woman is thinking: \"Foam-based bro?\"\n\nIt seems fitting for these two.\n\nAfter all, Ghost Messengers are beings whose age cannot be measured by their physical appearance. For example, his own little loli, thankfully she's still a loli. If she were given the body of a mature woman, who knows what the bookstore would turn into.\n\nAt this moment, a sudden feeling of dread strikes him.\n\nZheng Qiang and Yue Ya, who were \"flirting,\" immediately stiffen.\n\nZhou Ze also frowns slightly.\n\nIt's barely been a few hours since nightfall.\n\nThat thing,\n\nCan't it wait any longer?\n\nTo be precise,\n\nIs someone else about to have bad luck?\n\nDesire is ignited,\n\nAnd becomes uncontrollable,\n\nAll the way,\n\nTo death!\n\n...\n\n\"Should we catch it this time?\" Li Sen asks Gu He while running.\n\nGu He nods.\n\nThe fish have fattened; it's time to catch them.\n\n\"This Ghost Messenger from Tongcheng has quite an attitude, and he seems displeased with you keeping that thing within the university,\" Li Sen says, casually bad-mouthing Zhou Ze.\n\nThere are always people in this world who are willing to harm others without benefiting themselves.\n\nYou can understand those who harm others for their own benefit;\n\nThose who like to harm others without benefiting themselves are truly terrifying.\n\n\"He's a Ghost Messenger from Tongcheng, it's normal. Some Ghost Messengers like to have that 'parental official' mentality,\" Gu He says calmly.\n\nIn fact, the entity first appeared in Hangzhou, but Gu He drove it away.\n\nAt that time, Gu He had the opportunity to capture it but let it slip away through loopholes.\n\nThis led to the entity subsequently committing crimes in Suzhou, Wuxi, and even Huai'an.\n\nAs a constable, Gu He has much greater advantages in terms of methods and strength compared to Ghost Messengers. While it could be considered an accident for it to slip away once, letting it escape multiple times is unacceptable.\n\nThis is a bit like what feudal warlords used to do in ancient times... nurturing rebels for their own gain.\n\nLetting the entity kill more people, accumulate more karma, and grow fatter before he finally takes care of it would earn him more merit points.\n\nOf course,\n\nAll of this must be kept within a controllable range, without going too far, and must hover between the boundaries permitted by the Underworld and the boundaries of true dereliction of duty. Crossing that line would be more loss than gain.\n\nThis time,\n\nGu He intends to truly resolve the entity.\n\nIf he allows it to continue,\n\nHe himself will be implicated.\n\nHe can't cover it up anymore.\n\n\"After this is done, I need to ask him about that method of concealing his presence,\" Li Sen mutters to himself, as if reminding someone.\n\n\"Naturally, once this is resolved, I'll ask him as well.\"\n\nThe alliances between Ghost Messengers are often like a rabble, or rather, not \"like\" a rabble, but they *are* a rabble.\n\nThe two of them run to the bottom of Teaching Building B.\n\nLooking up,\n\nGu He closes his eyes and senses, then says,\n\n\"It's on the eighth and ninth floors.\"\n\nLi Sen sniffs his nose, a look of intoxication appearing on his face, but he quickly snaps out of it, a smile forming on his lips as he says,\n\n\"It seems the desire this time is sexual.\"\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze, Zheng Qiang, and Yue Ya are also running. If they're slow, they won't even catch the scraps.\n\nMerit points are allocated based on work. If you don't show up at all from beginning to end, you won't even get a meal box, let alone merit points.\n\nEven just standing on the sidelines and cheering \"666\" for others,\n\nMight earn you a consolation prize.\n\n\"This is a bit strange,\" Zheng Qiang says. \"I thought they would set up some formations, and we'd each have our roles in the capture. But we're just staying in the university, sensing the aura and rushing over. It's really a crude tactic.\"\n\n\"As long as it works,\" Yue Ya replies.\n\n\"If this works, why did that constable named Gu He fail consecutively in Hangzhou and in our cities?\" Zheng Qiang retorts.\n\nHearing this, Yue Ya is silent for a moment.\n\n\"If he had gathered us together and discussed tactics, researched countermeasures, I might not have doubted him. But just letting us rush in like this, his intention is obvious.\n\nHe wants us to follow along so he can eat the meat, and we get to drink some soup to shut us up.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThe tricks played by people at the constable level are much more advanced than ours. We're still foolishly waiting at home for ghosts to come to us, while they've already learned how to reasonably gain experience.\"\n\nZhou Ze understands Zheng Qiang's meaning.\n\nAfter all,\n\nHe has Lawyer An by his side.\n\nThe tricks they're playing now are even more outrageous than Gu He's, with Ghost Messengers directly engaging in human trafficking.\n\nHowever, Boss Zhou would never do something like Gu He, deliberately using ordinary people's lives to feed his own merit points.\n\nFirstly, it's too troublesome.\n\nTraveling all over the place is too tiring.\n\nSecondly, his conscience wouldn't allow it.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe three of them arrive at Teaching Building B.\n\nThe elevator seems to be out of order and has stopped working.\n\n\"Let's take the stairs, hurry!\" Zheng Qiang shouts. \"Don't let us miss even a sip of soup.\"\n\n...\n\nTeaching Building B, Eighth Floor, Classroom BJ805.\n\nIt's past study hall time,\n\nBut one student still remains in the classroom.\n\nHe sits in the furthest corner of the last row.\n\nGenerally, during university classes, those sitting in the front rows in the middle are usually the diligent students, while those in the front rows on the sides are often latecomers who quickly find seats.\n\nThe back rows are for napping, and the seats in the middle crowds are gathering spots for the \"sea cucumbers\" (slang for lazy students).\n\nThe lights in the study room are still on.\n\nIn front of him, a thick stack of books is laid out on the desk.\n\nPens,\n\nCalculators,\n\nVarious materials are spread out everywhere.\n\nWhen passing by from outside, or even looking at him from the front of the classroom,\n\nHe looks like someone diligently studying and doing problems.\n\nBut in reality,\n\nAmong the piles of books, there's a mobile phone and five power banks.\n\nThe phone is playing something inappropriate, and he's wearing headphones, listening to the sounds.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nWhen watching this kind of content,\n\nHe doesn't fast-forward at all.\n\nHe goes straight from the beginning with the beautiful dealer dealing cards online,\n\nAll the way to the end credits of the show!!!\n\nBelow,\n\nHe is holding a \"grey machine cup\"¹\n\nHe is agitated,\n\nHe is nervous,\n\nHe is hesitant,\n\nHe is disdainful.\n\nEven though blood is constantly dripping from the \"grey machine cup,\"\n\nEven though there are already puddles of blood on the floor,\n\nHe remains oblivious.\n\nAfter finishing one video,\n\nHe instinctively clicks on the next one...\n\n---\n¹ **Grey machine cup (灰機杯):** This is a slang term, likely referring to a disposable cup used for masturbation.",

    "content": "Climbing eight or nine floors in one go is not an easy task, even for ghost messengers. After all, ghost messengers' bodies are basically those of ordinary people, and they might even be weaker than ordinary people due to sleep and dietary issues.\n\nSometimes Zhou Ze wondered if the images of ghost messengers in folklore – big eyes drooping, pale complexion – were not just a way to scare people in that era, but purely because they themselves were very uncomfortable. After all, medical standards were poor back then, and there were all sorts of illnesses.\n\nOf course, in their haste to get some soup, the three of them gritted their teeth and sprinted as fast as they could, with Boss Zhou not excluded.\n\nZheng Qiang's body had the best physical condition. The jumping ability honed from playing basketball was fully displayed at this moment, giving him a lead of one floor over Zhou Ze and Yue Ya, and he was the first to reach the eighth floor.\n\nThe moment his feet landed,\n\nZheng Qiang felt a sudden heat ignite within him.\n\nThis heat came inexplicably, but he didn't have time to dwell on it. Upon seeing Gu He and Li Sen's location, he immediately ran over.\n\nGu He and Li Sen glanced at him, then entered a nearby classroom.\n\nZheng Qiang, unwilling to fall behind, quickly followed them in.\n\nUpon entering,\n\nHe felt as if the room was filled with a dense fog.\n\nSuch thick fog?\n\nZheng Qiang waved his hand, trying to dispel the mist in front of him, his feet continuing to move forward.\n\nAs he walked,\n\nA dynamic rhythm sounded in his ears, accompanied by piercing clamor.\n\nThere were men and women screaming,\n\nSomeone was yelling their lungs out into a microphone,\n\nThe dynamic melody mixed with all of this, forming a dizzying vortex.\n\nIn his line of sight, men and women writhed. Some sat on sofas, some lay on sofas, and several naked women stood on coffee tables, dancing provocatively.\n\nThe mingled scents of sweat, alcohol, and body odor formed a potent aphrodisiac.\n\nZheng Qiang's body instinctively began to move with them, a purely instinctual reaction.\n\nEveryone surrounded him, dancers accompanied him, making every effort to tempt him.\n\nThey cleared a space,\n\nAllowing Zheng Qiang to sit in the center of the sofa.\n\nSomeone handed him a flask and an alcohol lamp. Inside the flask, a pile of white powder was stacked.\n\nTo a specific group of people, this was the most dazzling and enchanting white.\n\nHolding it in his hand,\n\nA hint of hesitation flashed in Zheng Qiang's eyes.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\nHe wanted to stand up,\n\nHe wanted to leave this place,\n\nHe felt as if he had forgotten something important.\n\nHe even had an illusion as if he were in a dream.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nA dark shadow began to slowly materialize on the sofa.\n\nThe shadow began to merge into Zheng Qiang's body,\n\nZheng Qiang's eyes began to glow red, and his breathing suddenly deepened.\n\nThe sound waves in the KTV room rose another notch.\n\nPeople sang, shouted, and reveled,\n\nAs if they could not unleash their passion without becoming completely hysterical.\n\nBeside Zheng Qiang, many men and women were prostrate, serving Zheng Qiang, feeding.\n\nThe red in his eyes overwhelmed the last shred of clarity in Zheng Qiang's mind.\n\nHe pointed the bottom of the flask towards the alcohol lamp,\n\nAnd began to inhale the smoke.\n\nThe familiar feeling,\n\nThe familiar rhythm,\n\nGhost messengers without crossing the Naihe Bridge,\n\nRetaining memories from their past lives,\n\nNow,\n\nIt was as if a scene from a past life was replaying.\n\nZheng Qiang inhaled faster and faster, unable to stop. The white crystals at the bottom of the flask seemed inexhaustible.\n\n...\n\n\"Where's Zheng Qiang?\"\n\nAfter reaching the eighth floor, Yue Ya looked around and asked.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze also swept around.\n\n\"Could that guy have run ahead? He didn't even wait for us?\" Yue Ya gritted her teeth, very displeased.\n\nZhou Ze said cautiously, \"It seems there's a problem.\"\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze and Yue Ya saw Gu He and Li Sen standing at the doorway of a distant classroom. The two also looked towards Zhou Ze and the other, then entered a nearby classroom.\n\n\"They're there!\"\n\nYue Ya immediately ran over.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze remained in place, not moving.\n\nNo,\n\nThis shouldn't be happening.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. The slight panting from the strenuous exercise earlier had subsided, but the feeling of unease had not disappeared.\n\nFurthermore, Boss Zhou had experienced illusions and such things far too many times, giving him a resistance that was more than a notch above the other ghost messengers around him.\n\n\"Why aren't you coming?\"\n\nYue Ya, who had run a short distance, looked back at Zhou Ze. Instinctively, seeing Zhou Ze not move, she stopped running forward.\n\nThere might be some simpletons among ghost messengers, but there were certainly no fools.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips,\n\nThen, steeling himself,\n\nHe bit his tongue.\n\nInstantly,\n\nA violent dizziness struck, and Zhou Ze stumbled backward, his back almost against the wall.\n\nBut the feeling of mental disarray disappeared with it,\n\nReplaced by,\n\nAn oppressive coldness and heavy panting.\n\nYue Ya ran back to Zhou Ze's side and looked at him.\n\nZhou Ze saw an unusual gleam flowing in her eyes. This was not a change in her own appearance, but more like she was becoming entranced.\n\n\"There's a problem.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to his eyes.\n\nYue Ya was taken aback and immediately seemed to understand. A needle appeared in her left hand. The needle was very small, no different from those found in a sewing kit at home.\n\n\"Break the illusion! Dispel the delusion!\"\n\nYue Ya rubbed the needle back and forth on her forehead and hair, then exhaled a large puff of hot air onto the needle in front of her mouth.\n\nImmediately after, she took out a small glass bottle from her pocket. The bottle contained talisman water. She directly dropped the needle into the glass bottle.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nThe needle began to rust rapidly, almost turning entirely into rust, and the water became extremely murky.\n\nBut in return, Yue Ya's body felt lighter. Like Zhou Ze earlier, she stumbled. She reached out for Zhou Ze to grab her,\n\nBut Boss Zhou just stood there, surveying the surroundings, completely ignoring her.\n\n\"Ouch...\"\n\nYue Ya fell directly to the ground.\n\nThis man,\n\nWas he a bachelor in his past life too?\n\nThough it hurt, at least he could clearly sense that he was much more sober than before.\n\nIn fact, this method of using a needle to \"wake up\" is a custom that is still preserved in many places among the folk. It is usually used when headaches and fevers do not improve.\n\n\"What's happening?\" Yue Ya asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I have a bad feeling.\"\n\nThat feeling was,\n\nWho was the hunter,\n\nAnd who was the prey?\n\n...\n\n\"Does it need to be so extreme?\" Li Sen, beside Gu He, frowned slightly.\n\n\"The timid starve, the bold feast,\" Gu He smiled. \"If we fatten it up this time and consume it, it will be equivalent to half a year's merit points.\"\n\nLi Sen also smiled, but he felt uneasy.\n\nWasn't the initial plan just to hold back a little, to let it kill more people and increase the merit point rewards?\n\nHow come, in the end,\n\nThey were even sending ghost messengers into it?\n\nGu He had never consulted him about intentionally luring ghost messengers to their deaths for merit.\n\nSilently, Li Sen decided to leave. He wasn't someone with a kind heart, but he was by no means a foolish idiot.\n\nWhen Gu He suddenly told him to send a few ghost messengers as casualties,\n\nHe wouldn't just laugh foolishly and add a few flattering remarks as before.\n\nInstead, he instinctively wondered,\n\nWas his own life,\n\nPart of Gu He's plan?\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\nGu He turned and asked.\n\n\"I'm leaving.\"\n\nLi Sen said resolutely, and a mass of blue flame began to circulate around him. This clearly indicated his distrust and his intention to quit playing along.\n\nEven if he didn't get to share this soup, he had to leave.\n\nThings had changed too quickly.\n\nNot leaving would be idiotic.\n\nGu He let out a long sigh, turned his back, and waved his hand.\n\n\"Then, goodbye.\"\n\nLi Sen initially thought Gu He was letting him go and heaved a sigh of relief. He even felt a little regret.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nThe Captain wasn't planning to deal with him.\n\nHe still wanted to help him and bring him along to share the soup?\n\nHowever,\n\nBefore he could even descend the stairs,\n\nA black shadow silently dripped down from above.\n\nYes,\n\nDripped.\n\nLike blotches of black,\n\nThey began to fall onto Li Sen's body.\n\nThe faint blue luminescence that had been rising around Li Sen was completely covered by blackness. He only felt his vision darken. When he opened his eyes again, he found himself standing on the roof of a tall building.\n\nIn front of him,\n\nA group of people were lined up,\n\nSome young, some old, some men, some women.\n\nThere was his elementary school deskmate, his junior high school class president, the boyfriend of the girl he liked in high school, his college roommate, his colleagues from work.\n\nThey had received praise from teachers, walked to and from school with their crushes, received scholarships, received financial aid for poor students, received commendations from their bosses.\n\nThey,\n\nWere all people Li Sen had deeply envied and cursed in his heart.\n\nNow,\n\nThey stood before him in rows.\n\nStarting with his elementary school deskmate,\n\nThey walked forward numbly, one by one,\n\nAnd jumped off the building.\n\nThis was a skyscraper.\n\nJumping from here would surely result in being splattered into a pulp.\n\nWatching them jump one after another,\n\nLi Sen's previously calm expression began to show uncontrollable delight.\n\nThat kind of exhilaration,\n\nThat kind of release,\n\nThat kind of joy,\n\nCould not be understood or empathized with by someone who had never deeply envied others!\n\nYou,\n\nDeserve to die,\n\nAll of you must die,\n\nGo to hell,\n\nAnd suffer torment!\n\nGo to hell,\n\nAll of you!\n\nWhy were you better than me?\n\nWhy were you doing better than me?\n\nAll of you,\n\nDeserve to die!!!\n\nLi Sen laughed hysterically, he couldn't suppress his laughter,\n\nBut he didn't notice that a fire had already ignited beneath his feet.\n\nHe was actually standing on a bonfire,\n\nAs person after person jumped off the building,\n\nThe flames beneath his feet gradually rose.\n\nThe fire of jealousy,\n\nThe first to be burned,\n\nWould actually be himself!\n\nBut he was completely oblivious,\n\nStill immersed in this pleasure of \"revenge and retribution,\"\n\nDeeply,\n\nIrreversibly!",

    "content": "\"Open your eyes!\"\n\nYueya's left pupil was instantly covered in white, and her entire demeanor changed drastically.\n\nOf course, this only lasted for less than ten seconds.\n\nThen, she stumbled again.\n\nHowever, this time she was smarter and leaned towards Zhou Ze. She was genuinely temporarily drained and needed Zhou Ze to support her.\n\nZhou Ze took a step to the side.\n\n\"Thump...\"\n\nYueya fell to the ground again.\n\nFor a moment, speechless.\n\n\"What did you see?\"\n\nThis woman's ability should be eyes that can see through illusions. Because the moment she shouted \"Open your eyes,\" Zhou Ze felt the poker card in his clothes tremble, and his concealed aura was almost broken.\n\nYueya got up from the ground, frowning, and glanced resentfully at Zhou Ze. She said in a deep voice:\n\n\"In the classroom on the left, there's an unknown man masturbating. He's not ejaculating white stuff anymore; he's continuously shooting blood.\"\n\nRegarding shooting blood, Zhou Ze remembered a small story he once read, about a king in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods who was particularly fond of women. He overdosed on primitive aphrodisiacs, losing control and starting to bleed, eventually bleeding himself to death.\n\n\"In the classroom on the right, Zheng Qiang is sitting there, his body slowly withering, his eye sockets sunken, like...\"\n\nYueya bit her lip, and finally voiced her guess:\n\n\"An overdose.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned. Even a Ghost Messenger had fallen victim?\n\n\"At the corridor entrance of the opposite building, Li Sen is standing there, with large areas of burns appearing on his body.\"\n\n\"What about Gu He?\"\n\nWhere was the Captain who called everyone to come together for a share of the profits?\n\n\"Couldn't find him.\" Yueya shook her head.\n\nBoss Zhou was speechless. He really should have been more shameless and let the little loli take his place for this activity.\n\nOf course, no one expected that Zhou Ze's first response to a superior's call since becoming a Ghost Messenger would be to encounter a scammer leader.\n\nNow, out of four Ghost Messengers, two had fallen victim.\n\nHe had three choices:\n\nOne was to save them.\n\nSecond, find the \"ghost\" and eliminate it.\n\nThird, turn around and leave.\n\nZhou Ze actually leaned towards the third option, but he found it difficult to choose it. Because this was Tongcheng, and if he knew about it and deliberately avoided doing anything, any further harmful actions by the \"ghost\" would be attributed to him.\n\nYueya, as if telepathically connected, immediately said: \"I'm preparing to leave. Things here have changed, and the Captain has disappeared. This is not normal.\"\n\nShe could leave; she wasn't a Tongcheng Ghost Messenger.\n\n\"Can you leave?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nAs soon as Yueya finished speaking, she saw a ball of eerie black shadow attacking her.\n\nShe immediately waved her palm, and dozens of silver needles centered on her covered the area at her feet. The black shadow prowled around, unable to advance an inch.\n\nA black shadow also attacked Zhou Ze's feet. Boss Zhou's fingernails grew out, piercing directly into the floor. The black mist dispersed, forming a barrier that blocked the black shadow outside.\n\nThe two sides remained in a stalemate for a long time.\n\nFinally, the black shadow retreated.\n\nYueya bent down and waved her hand on the ground, retracting the needles stuck in the ground.\n\nZhou Ze also pulled out his fingernails.\n\nIf that thing only had these means, if they were careful, it wouldn't be a big problem.\n\nIt was painful and annoying.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't someone who worried about the world's troubles before they happened. As long as he could lie on the sofa, drink coffee, and bask in the sun, he wouldn't care even if floods raged outside. But this matter was directly related to him, so he couldn't ignore it.\n\nTaking a few steps forward, Zhou Ze first turned into the classroom on the right.\n\nZheng Qiang was sitting there with a dazed expression, just as Yueya had described.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and touched Zheng Qiang.\n\nInstantly, a haze of mist appeared before Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIn the mist, Zhou Ze saw Zheng Qiang sitting on a sofa, surrounded by men and women dancing wildly, while Zheng Qiang continuously sucked white smoke from a flask.\n\nThis kind of consumption, even an elephant couldn't handle it.\n\nMoreover, perhaps because of the clarity of an observer, Zhou Ze saw that the men and women around Zheng Qiang were all skeletons. Their heads looked like they had been gnawed by insects, with holes everywhere, more terrifying than a honeycomb.\n\nZhou Ze had been a doctor in his previous life. He knew that some specific poisons, if inhaled, could cause severe and irreversible damage to the brain. The faster the addiction, the greater the harm to the human body. Countless people became vegetative from over-consumption, while those lucky enough to be sent to rehab centers were considered fortunate.\n\nBut Zheng Qiang was indulging himself, not even noticing Zhou Ze's arrival, continuing to revel in it.\n\nIndeed, if ghost messengers on the roadside could be relied upon, pigs would be able to climb trees.\n\nAlthough he was also just a ghost messenger, Zhou Ze felt it was beneath him to be on a mission with a bunch of low-level ghost messengers. If he hadn't participated, discussing it with the little loli and Lawyer An and proceeding step by step would have been much better than these scamming teammates constantly giving away kills.\n\nBut now there was no choice. With these teammates who were like [pig emoji], you still had to save them. Even if a few more cannon fodder came, they could at least act as decoys.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew out, waving continuously. The skeletons in front of him were shattered by Zhou Ze one by one.\n\nBut Zheng Qiang still acted as if he saw nothing, continuing to indulge in his greatest vice from his past life.\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward and crushed the flask in Zheng Qiang's hand.\n\nZheng Qiang froze, his blood-red eyes fixed on Zhou Ze. He let out a roar, and barbs appeared on his body, like a hedgehog. He then roared and charged at Zhou Ze.\n\nFor an addict, anyone who stopped them from taking drugs, even their parents, wives, or children, would be their greatest enemy!\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails swept across the barbs on his body, emitting a metallic clanging sound. In an instant, many of the barbs on his body pierced into Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou shivered from the pain.\n\nAnd within Zhou Ze's body, the huge bloody character \"封\" (Seal) began to tremble slightly.\n\n\"Come on... break the seal... you need my power!\"\n\nThat consciousness was calling out to Zhou Ze: \"Ghost messengers... are just... my... food!\"\n\n\"Get lost!\" Zhou Ze roared.\n\nThe next moment, Boss Zhou's ten fingernails grew rapidly, turning into scythe-like curves. He crossed his arms in front of him and pushed forward.\n\nHe finally blocked Zheng Qiang, and then, Zhou Ze's ten fingernails thrust forward together. Zhou Ze didn't choose to stab the guy's chest directly; instead, he chose to stab his arms.\n\n\"Poof!\"\n\nIntense pain struck, and the surrounding mist began to dissipate.\n\nZhou Ze looked down and found many needle-like blood holes on his body. Although the injuries were not serious, they really hurt.\n\nZheng Qiang, who had been sitting in his seat, had blood gushing from his arms. He opened his eyes blankly, looking at Zhou Ze, then at his surroundings. While trying to stop the bleeding, he asked:\n\n\"What exactly is going on?\"\n\n...\n\nYueya didn't follow Zhou Ze. They had both died once, so they understood the value of life better. At the same time, the instinct to avoid harm and seek benefit was ingrained in their bones. It wasn't because they understood life that they cherished it. It was because hell was too terrifying, and it was better to live in the mortal world!\n\nThis wasn't cowardice. This gathering was originally approached with the attitude of trying to get a sip of soup. It wasn't an event happening in their jurisdiction, so why risk their lives for it? Plus, that Tongcheng scoundrel had made her fall twice, so she was even less likely to help him!\n\nHowever, as Yueya ran up the stairs to the third floor, a familiar figure appeared at the top of the third-floor staircase.\n\nThis person was Gu He.\n\n\"Why are you leaving?\" Gu He looked up at Yueya on the stairs.\n\n\"This ghost, if not eliminated, will cause endless harm.\" As he spoke, Gu He began to walk up the stairs.\n\n\"Captain, you?\" Yueya suddenly felt a sense of dread for some reason and began to instinctively retreat. Earlier, Zhou Ze had told her, you think you can still leave? She hadn't taken it to heart. Now, she suddenly felt that Zhou Ze's words might have a deeper meaning.\n\n\"It is our responsibility as ghost messengers. I chased it from Hangzhou to Wuxi, Suzhou, then to Huaian, and now to Tongcheng. This time, I can't let it escape again. Look how many people he has already killed.\"\n\nGu He walked up, and Yueya retreated.\n\n\"No, why are you here? You couldn't have arrived this late! What are your intentions, Captain!\" No one is a fool. Zheng Qiang had previously analyzed that Gu He was intentionally sending himself as \"experience points\" to the ghost so that he could reap the rewards.\n\n\"No, really not.\" Gu He continued to walk up step by step, then he stopped.\n\nYueya was stunned for a moment. The next moment, Gu He suddenly appeared behind her, grabbing her neck with one hand and lifting her up. Yueya opened her mouth, but Gu He covered her mouth with his other hand. Then, Gu He withdrew his hand, and his entire palm was covered with steel needles.\n\n\"I just wanted this ghost to create more sin, to send more kills. Since ordinary people have been sent, why can't ghost messengers be sent? When it's captured, the merit points and rewards will be even greater.\"\n\nGu He stuck out his tongue and licked Yueya's earlobe.\n\n\"So, please don't run, cooperate with me properly. Perhaps I can let you have a sip of soup, because someone upstairs has broken free. What a group of unthinking subordinates, can't they understand the hardships of being a leader?\"\n\n\"Open your eyes!\"\n\nYueya's left eye was instantly covered with white. Then, her entire face turned ashen. Because if Gu He was really only doing this for merit points, she was confident there would still be room for maneuver. At worst, she could exchange other things with Gu He; it would just be a matter of profit.\n\nBut just now, she clearly saw a black character \"貪\" (Greed) appear on Gu He's forehead!\n\nThe Captain who issued this operation order had already been controlled by this ghost back in Hangzhou!",

    "content": "Gu He was still choking Yue Ya's neck. Perhaps, even he himself didn't know that he had already fallen victim. The words he had said earlier, the Ghost Catcher summons he had issued, might not have been intentional, but rather a natural action under the influence of \"greed.\"\n\nFirst, he sent ordinary people to feed it.\nThen, he began sending Ghost Catchers to feed it.\nThe single character \"greed\" can endlessly amplify human desires, while repeatedly lowering one's bottom line.\n\nIf you say that ghost was \"controlling\" him, probably not, it's not quite that. But he was indeed, and concretely, acting according to that ghost's line of thinking.\n\nWhen you are stuck in a swamp, by the time you realize the danger, it's already too late. And the more you struggle, the faster you sink.\n\nHer neck was tightened more and more, and gradually, she began to suffocate.\n\nIn fact, Yue Ya felt that if Gu He wanted to, if he just twisted, her life would be ended.\n\nDamn it.\nThat Tongcheng Ghost Catcher,\nhad he already sensed something...?\n\nJust as Yue Ya was about to reach her breaking point, Gu He released his hand.\n\nYue Ya fell to the ground, but in an instant, her previously weakened spirit suddenly surged. She let out a sharp cry, and long needles, red and black respectively, appeared in the palms of her left and right hands.\n\nSince you've given me an opportunity,\nI won't be polite!\nEven if it's a Captain she's facing,\nbut as long as the other party dares to threaten her life,\nthere's nothing to fear.\n\nThe disparity in status and position wasn't enough to offset the agony of a trip through hell!\n\nHowever, Gu He slapped down forcefully with both hands, his palms slamming hard onto Yue Ya's wrists.\n\nYue Ya felt a sudden numbness in both hands, completely losing sensation. The two needles also fell to the ground. At the same time, Gu He swept his ankle sideways, kicking Yue Ya's knee.\n\n\"Thud...\"\n\nYue Ya fell down again.\n\nAs she was falling, Gu He backhanded Yue Ya, slapping the back of her head.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nHer back of the head took a heavy blow.\nYue Ya knelt to the ground,\nher consciousness falling into a semi-comatose state.\n\nOn the ground, the black shadows that had previously been driven away by the needles began to approach again, merging into Yue Ya's body.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nA scream erupted from Yue Ya's mouth.\n\n…………\n\n\"Why, why!!!!\"\n\nIn the living room, Yue Ya smashed everything she could see.\n\nShe was enraged,\nshe roared,\nshe was furious beyond control!\n\nHer husband's divorce petition lay on the coffee table, with a fountain pen beside it.\n\n\"Damn it! Damn it ahhhhhh!!!!\" Yue Ya grabbed the divorce petition in front of her and tore it to shreds like a madwoman.\n\nGrabbing her hair, she squatted down. In her mind, vows of eternal love from their dating days began to surface. And that bygone intimacy between lovers, recalling it now, carried an immense sense of irony and mockery!\n\n\"Just because... just because I can't have children?\"\n\nYue Ya cried and shouted.\nShe wasn't afraid of the neighbors hearing.\nAt this point,\nshe had lost all face,\nand didn't need it anymore.\n\nFor many women,\nthe two words \"divorce,\"\ndon't just signify a change in future lifestyle, but a self-negation. This is certainly a wrong notion and mindset, yet this mindset is deeply entrenched in the minds of many women.\n\nRage filled her mind,\nrage at her husband's heartlessness,\nrage at her inability to bear children,\nall kinds of rage,\noverwhelmed her thoughts, overwhelmed everything.\n\nPicking up a shard of broken glass beside her, Yue Ya mercilessly cut a gash on her arm. The sting of pain, the gush of blood, only served to add fuel to the fire, allowing her fury to finally find an outlet. What followed was an even more terrifying eruption!\n\n…………\n\nAt the stairwell entrance, wounds began to appear on Yue Ya's body, and blood started to gush out. But she remained kneeling there, motionless.\n\nWounds continued to appear, blood flowed even faster, a puddle had already collected on the ground.\n\nAfter seeing this scene, Gu He nodded, then turned and walked upstairs.\n\nUp there, there were two more, huh.\n\n…………\n\nThe young man who had been masturbating¹ was already breathless, his pupils dilated, lay slumped on his desk.\n\nAs Zhou Ze passed by him, he reached out and closed the young man's wide-open eyes.\n\nEveryone has desires in their heart, everyone has delusions in their heart. In this world, there is no one who is absolutely pure and noble.\n\nIf one merely indulges slightly in their own specific desires without harming others, it's actually harmless, and most people can understand.\n\nTherefore, this kind of behavior that constantly arouses desires in people's hearts, thereby achieving the goal of \"setting oneself on fire\"², is truly despicable.\n\nZhou Ze sat on a chair, bandaging his wounds. The wounds weren't very deep, and not a big problem, but those few blood thorns still hurt a bit.\n\nZheng Qiang silently bandaged his arms with his own clothes. His physical condition was good, and it didn't seem to affect him much now. Of course, this was also because Zhou Ze hadn't chosen to insert them into vital spots, leaving some leeway.\n\nGhost Catchers had begun to fall victim, and the situation had fallen into a complex vortex.\n\nAccording to Boss Zhou's nature, he should have long since made a quick getaway³. But duty called, damned duty called.\n\n\"Next, do we go find the ghost or Captain Gu He?\" Zheng Qiang asked.\n\n\"Are you talking about one thing or two?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nZheng Qiang was stunned for a moment. He understood the implication in Zhou Ze's words, and said, somewhat incredulously, \"No way?\"\n\nA Captain, doing something like this under these circumstances, is he really not afraid of punishment from the Underworld Bureau?\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nAfter tending to his wounds, Zhou Ze and Zheng Qiang walked out of the classroom together. At the stairwell on the other end from where they entered, Zhou Ze saw a charred corpse on the ground. A strong smell of roasted meat permeated the air around it, as if a BBQ had just been held.\n\nWhat was most surprising was that, the corpse was completely burned to charcoal, but the clothes on the body, and even the watch on the wrist, were perfectly preserved.\n\nBecause of this, the identity of the corpse could be clearly determined—Li Sen.\n\nZhou Ze and Zheng Qiang looked at this scene, both feeling heavy-hearted.\n\nIf it were just ordinary people dying, everyone could still remain calm. But now Ghost Catchers had started dying. This meant that the roles of prey and hunter had been officially reversed.\n\nOriginally, they had gathered to capture that ghost.\n\nBut now, it seemed,\nit was more like they themselves had become prey joining this place,\nand that ghost was the true hunter!\n\nLi Sen was burned to death; anyone not blind could see that.\n\nBut he was burned alive by the fire of jealousy, dying with a smile and a sense of exhilaration. This was something that couldn't be observed.\n\n\"I want to leave.\"\n\nZheng Qiang said, his face somewhat twisted.\n\nHis attitude towards Zhou Ze was much better now than before, because he knew that just now, if Zhou Ze hadn't saved him, he would now be in the same situation as Li Sen.\n\nBut he wouldn't have been burned to death, but would have turned into skin and bones, having been forcibly sucked dry into a human husk!\n\nCurrently, Ghost Catchers had already died. He didn't want to die, so he wanted to leave.\n\n\"What a motley crew indeed.\"\n\nBoss Zhou thought spitefully to himself, then took out his phone. He ignored Zheng Qiang, and instead planned to call the bookstore for a few helpers.\n\nIf the little loli came, she could share some 'aggro' and help him 'tank'⁴. As for Lawyer An, Zhou Ze didn't know how high his upper limit was, but he would definitely have his own methods.\n\nEven the Deadman could come, and shout, \"God said, 'Let there be light.'\"\n\nHowever, when he took out his phone, Zhou Ze discovered there was no signal!\n\nGenerally speaking, signal is indeed much worse in tall buildings, but that's only limited to poor internet signal. It's impossible for it to be unable to connect to receive or make calls.\n\n\"Are you still staying here? Oh right, you're a local Ghost Catcher from Tongcheng. Sorry, brother, I'm leaving first.\"\n\nZheng Qiang was indeed a bit embarrassed. After all, the other person had just saved him, and now he was planning to bolt.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, and gave Zheng Qiang a deep look.\n\nZheng Qiang ignored Zhou Ze's gaze, and immediately began running down the stairs.\n\nHe ran very fast. He wanted to leave this teaching building, leave this university, and return to his own jurisdiction. As for what changes would happen here afterward, it had nothing to do with him!\n\nHowever, when he reached the second floor, Gu He's figure abruptly appeared at the stairwell entrance.\n\nGu He's expression was grim. He stood in the shadows, but his body couldn't be completely concealed, nor did he intend to conceal it.\n\nSilently, Gu He began walking up towards Zheng Qiang.\n\n\"Why are subordinates always so disobedient? Can't you share a little bit of the pressure with your leader?\"\n\nGu He walked up step by step.\n\nBy this point, clear lines had already appeared on his face.\n\nFurthermore, murderous intent had already emerged from his body!\n\nThe poisoning was getting deeper and deeper.\n\nZheng Qiang began to back away. \"Captain, what exactly is going on?\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" Gu He smiled, then his smile froze. His figure vanished, and Gu He's figure appeared directly behind Zheng Qiang.\n\nJust like the method he used against Yue Ya earlier, it was exactly the same!\n\nA sense of crisis immediately arrived. Spines protruded from Zheng Qiang's back, serving as a defense.\n\nGu He had to lower his raised hand, but in the next instant, he reappeared in front of Zheng Qiang. His speed was unimaginably fast!\n\nThe spines on Zheng Qiang's front hadn't grown out yet, when Gu He's palm strike arrived!\n\n\"Bang!\" Zheng Qiang was sent flying, slamming into the wall at the stairwell entrance.\n\nGu He continued to advance, and slammed a palm down onto Zheng Qiang's forehead.\n\nSuddenly, a black shadow appeared, blocking Gu He.\n\nGu He paused, retracted his palm strike, and at the same time, punched out with his other hand.\n\nThe black shadow had originally been defending against the palm, but Gu He's change of move caught the black shadow somewhat off guard.\n\nIn fact, many details showed that Gu He knew martial arts. What he relied on was not just the special abilities of a Ghost Catcher or a Captain.\n\n\"Bang!\" A dull thud was heard. The black shadow was sent stumbling back many steps by a single punch, its back hitting the wall, leaning against Zheng Qiang.\n\n\"You...\" Zheng Qiang looked at the black shadow beside him. He recognized it. The black shadow was Zhou Ze, clad in a mysterious samurai armor.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and took a look. The armor on his abdomen was already dented, and although it was still automatically repairing itself, it was enough to show how terrifying the force of that punch was.\n\nA Captain-level powerhouse, terrifying indeed!\n\nZhou Ze turned his face and looked at Zheng Qiang beside him. \"Heh, you want to leave? Can you get away?\"\n\nZheng Qiang shook his head, and instead pointed at the samurai armor on Zhou Ze, asking: \"You have this armor, why didn't you use it when I stabbed you with the thorns earlier?\"\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment. He hadn't expected Zheng Qiang to ask this question at such a time. But he still replied: \"I don't use this thing much normally, and a lot of the time, I just forget I even have it.\"\n\n---\n¹ \"Beating the plane\" (打灰機): A Chinese slang term for masturbating.\n² \"Setting oneself on fire\" (引火燒身): An idiom meaning to bring disaster upon oneself.\n³ \"Make a quick getaway\" (風緊扯呼): An idiom meaning to escape quickly or bolt.\n⁴ \"Tank\" / \"Aggro\" (拉一拉怪): A gaming term for drawing the enemy's attention to oneself, often to protect other party members.",

Back then, he felt like a poodle, daring to mount anyone, whether a Golden Retriever or a Husky.\n\nBut the bitter fruit borne from those days was the greatly accelerated awakening of that certain individual, just as he had said in prison before.\n\nWithin half a year at most,\nHe would be fully awake!\nThis was all thanks to Boss Zhou's past lack of restraint.\n\nIf it weren't for the chance encounter with that idiot,\nBoss Zhou's days might have already been numbered.\nHe could have written a book titled \"If I Had Half a Year of Light.\"\n\nHowever, even so, when facing Gu He, Zhou Ze habitually reached out to touch the fountain pen hidden in his clothes pocket.\n\nIn his mind, he could seemingly picture the face identical to his, sealed beneath the Nether Sea,\nSmiling smugly,\nWaiting for him to call,\nWaiting for him to actively break the seal,\nAnd call him \"Dad!\"\n\nBut as long as there was a glimmer of hope, Zhou Ze would not attempt to break that seal again. He had half a year left, and he didn't want to mess around and turn it into three months.\nThen mess around again and turn it into just over a month.\nDying in a month or dying immediately, the difference wasn't that great.\n\nGu He tilted his head, black lines beginning to spread down his neck. At this moment, Gu He looked more like a marionette.\nThose black lines, like the threads of a puppet, were controlling his every move.\n\nAfter his inner greed was fully ignited,\nMany things,\nWere no longer under his own control.\n\nSuddenly,\nGu He's expression froze again.\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\nZheng Qiang, who was beside him, also shouted, \"Be careful!\"\n\nIn the space between the two, Gu He's figure appeared, throwing punches at them respectively.\nWith prior warning, they weren't caught too off guard.\nZhou Ze blocked the punch with his arms held in front of him.\nZheng Qiang, relying on the barbs on his palms, exchanged a punch with Gu He.\n\nGu He's fist became bloody and mangled, with many barbs still embedded in it.\nBut in the next moment, he exposed his back to Zheng Qiang and focused solely on Zhou Ze.\nPerhaps,\nIn Gu He's eyes,\nZheng Qiang, covered in thorns, was too prickly and difficult to handle. Zhou Ze was easier.\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAt the same time, Gu He shouted, \"You can leave, I won't stop you.\"\nThis was an attempt to surround three sides and leave Zheng Qiang an escape route.\nFortunately, Zheng Qiang didn't act foolishly this time. Now that he and Zhou Ze were cooperating, there was at least a chance to resist. He didn't naively believe Gu He would actually let him go. Even if Gu He was sincere now, he wouldn't dare to gamble!\nIf Zhou Ze was also defeated and dealt with, leaving him alone, he would truly have no chance to resist.\n\nThree consecutive punches,\nSo fast that Zhou Ze could only forcefully endure them with his armor.\nHe didn't even have the ability to retaliate with his fingernails.\nMoreover, Gu He's moves were like a combo in martial arts, one flowing into the next, giving Zhou Ze no chance to breathe or relax.\nThis guy actually knew kung fu!\n\nZheng Qiang rushed from behind, his barbs growing longer again, like a super-powered Wolverine, charging at Gu He's back.\nBut Gu He's figure vanished at that moment.\nZheng Qiang crashed into Zhou Ze.\n\"Clang!!!!\"\nZhou Ze had already taken several punches and, with Zheng Qiang's collision, could no longer hold on, falling to the ground. His armor was also covered in dense small holes.\nIf he hadn't remembered to wear this armor, he would have had dozens of bloody holes on his body just moments ago.\n\nZheng Qiang didn't have time to pull up the fallen Zhou Ze,\nBecause in the next moment,\nGu He appeared at his side, his previously bloody fist smashing over again.\nZheng Qiang dodged by tilting his head.\n\"Bang!\"\nA punch with bare white bone shattered the wall, and then he swept his arm like a chain, hitting Zheng Qiang's neck with flying plaster.\nZheng Qiang was sent flying, crashing onto the ground.\nThe neck is one of the most vulnerable parts of the body. He was now convulsing on the ground, barely able to get up.\n\nZhou Ze knelt on one knee, breathing heavily.\nActually, Gu He's strength was secondary. Zhou Ze didn't believe there would be such a huge power gap between a Constable and a Ghost Envoy.\nHe wasn't that far from being a Constable.\nCould there be some special benefit when advancing to Constable that increased one's strength?\nBut the little loli and Lawyer An had never mentioned anything like that.\nIt seemed that only upon advancing to Patrol Inspector, one would be promoted from \"clerk\" to \"official.\" Only upon advancing to Judge would the Underworld grant you the Judge's Brush and the Yin-Yang Register.\nBefore that, the Underworld's attitude was simple: fend for yourselves.\n\nGu He's speed was truly too fast, so fast that it was impossible to keep up.\nJust moments ago, he was ten meters in front of you,\nBut in the next moment,\nHe directly appeared behind you to attack.\nSuch speed,\nPractically placed him in an invincible position.\n\nImpossible, his speed couldn't be this fast.\nZhou Ze recalled the scenes of the awakened individual within him fighting with several strong opponents.\nEven the old man who was an embodiment of evil thoughts that appeared that night,\nDidn't have such terrifying speed!\nCould Gu He be a hidden protagonist?\nPossessing such formidable combat potential at the Constable level?\nBut looking at him now, he was clearly being controlled.\nIf his speed couldn't be that fast,\nThen it must be...\nA visual trick!\nThat's right,\nExactly.\nEvery time he moved quickly,\nHis original figure left at the scene would suddenly stiffen.\nThis was a visual trick!\n\nA person's eyes \"see\" things through light reflection. So, according to the knowledge from junior high physics textbooks,\nThe principle of an invisibility cloak should be that the clothes have many cameras that reflect images from other directions, making the person wearing the invisibility cloak invisible from one's \"point of view.\"\nThis trope and principle have appeared in many sci-fi movies over the years. Not long ago, after the old Taoist took the monkey to the cinema to watch Dwayne Johnson's new movie, \"Skyscraper,\"\nHe seemed to have mentioned that this movie also had a similar design.\n\nZhou Ze thrust his fingernails into the ceramic tile with one hand,\nDark mist began to spread out.\nA faint black mist, without any offensive properties, but large enough in area and wide enough in range.\nGu He slowly walked over, his right fist white, half the color of bare bone and half the color of the lime powder from breaking the wall.\nBut he showed no sign of pain,\nContinuing to walk forward.\nAnd then,\nHis expression suddenly didn't change.\nZhou Ze quickly calmed himself,\nThe black mist to his left was suddenly pushed aside,\nTo the left!\nZhou Ze pulled his fingernails out of the ground and then, with his hands like scythes, slashed in that direction!\n\"Clang!\"\n\"Thwack!\"\nGu He directly blocked his left hand's fingernails,\nWhile his right hand's fingernails pierced Gu He's lower abdomen.\nIt seemed even Gu He didn't expect Zhou Ze to see through his visual trick. What was supposed to be his sneak attack turned into Zhou Ze's sneak attack on him.\nAnd Boss Zhou wouldn't show mercy at this moment. The fingernails stuck in Gu He's abdomen began to churn directly, taking advantage of his injury to end his life!\nGu He's body suddenly stiffened,\nThen he let out a roar,\nThe word \"Greed\" on his forehead actually appeared, and the flesh on that spot even bulged out.\nThe word \"Greed\" can make people develop a murderous intent, make them forget their oaths, forget their beliefs, make them take risks, and even make them disregard their lives!\nMan dies for wealth, birds die for food!\nTo Zhou Ze's surprise,\nGu He did not retreat,\nBut charged forward directly, rushing along his fingernails.\nHis fingernails had pierced through the other's abdomen, even his own arm had pierced through the opponent's lower abdomen. At the same time, Zhou Ze lost his chance to maneuver.\nNonsense,\nHis entire arm was inside the guy's stomach, was he supposed to chop off his arm and run?\nBoss Zhou was ruthless towards others, that was fine,\nBut towards himself,\nHe really couldn't bring himself to do it!\nGu He slammed both fists towards Zhou Ze's head, and Zhou Ze had no way to block him at this moment.\nWith a loud crash,\nZhou Ze's head armor actually shattered,\nZhou Ze's head also received a powerful blow. Although the previous helmet had absorbed most of the force, preventing Boss Zhou from being directly headshotted, the forceful impact still made Zhou Ze feel dizzy.\n\"Bang!\"\nGu He kicked Zhou Ze away. Zhou Ze fell to the ground and slid more than ten meters.\nHis arms lay limply by his sides,\nNot dead,\nStill conscious,\nBut his consciousness was in chaos.\nGu He walked a few steps forward, intending to finish off Zhou Ze, but in the next moment, he also collapsed to the ground. The massive wound on his chest made him unable to bear it.\nAt this moment,\nShadows attacked again,\nSplitting into three parts,\nOne pierced into the already downed Zheng Qiang, one pierced into Gu He,\nAnd the last part,\nPierced into Zhou Ze.\nAccording to Catholic doctrine, the sins of the world often stem from the seven deadly sins:\nLust,\nGluttony,\nGreed,\nSloth,\nWrath,\nEnvy,\nPride.\nThat classmate \"Lu Chuxue\" who died watching videos in the classroom earlier,\nDied of Lust,\nThe deceased female college student in the dormitory died of Pride,\nThat male student died of Gluttony. Zheng Qiang could also be considered a type of Gluttony.\nGu He was Greed,\nMoon Crescent was Wrath,\nLi Sen was Envy,\nNow,\nOnly one remained.\nZhou Ze, lying on the ground, still dazed from the blow to his head, hadn't realized,\nOn his forehead,\nA word had clearly appeared,\nAnd it was a very shameful word,\nWhich was:\nSloth!",

    "content": "In the morning, the sun was bright. When Boss Zhou opened his eyes, he found himself lying on the sofa in the bookstore.\n\nIn front of him,\n\ncoffee and a newspaper.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and rubbed the spot on his temples. His head still throbbed, as if he hadn't fully recovered from the dizziness.\n\nMoreover, this scene was all too familiar. Not long ago, that idiot had also tried to curry favor with him by creating a similar atmosphere.\n\nHowever, this time it was a bit different. The difference was that the newspaper wasn't neatly ironed but was damp, and water was continuously dripping from the ceiling of the bookhouse.\n\nBai Yingying was slacking off,\n\nThe old Taoist priest was also slacking off.\n\nAlthough it was sunny outside and not raining, the bookhouse was like a curtain of water, with a shallow pool of water on the ground. It looked like there were many dead fish and shrimp in the water.\n\nA damp, decaying smell permeated the surroundings, exuding a nauseating moldiness.\n\nZhou Ze propped his hand on the coffee table, the other hand supporting his chin. He felt disgusted but forced himself to shake his head, his gaze intermittently clear and hazy.\n\nOpposite Zhou Ze sat a dark shadow wearing a clown mask and dressed in black. A cup of coffee and a newspaper were also placed before him.\n\nSeeing the coffee on the other's coffee table and smelling the familiar civet coffee aroma,\n\nBoss Zhou frowned slightly.\n\nEven in his dreams,\n\nBoss Zhou felt uncomfortable being served his coffee by a stranger.\n\n\"Only you are left.\"\n\nBeneath the clown mask, there seemed to be a very young soul. The other's voice carried a strong \"girly\" tone, yet it was a man's voice. When he spoke, it felt like he was singing.\n\nIt was like sitting in the audience watching *danhua* actors perform.\n\n\"Only I am left?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a little confused, but he stood up from his seat. However, just as Zhou Ze was about to move from his spot, he felt as if his feet were stuck with super glue, and he couldn't move.\n\nWhen he tried to force his way, Zhou Ze was instead jolted back a few steps, landing back on the sofa. This time, the sofa seemed to be filled with a viscous liquid, firmly adhering Zhou Ze's entire back to it.\n\nBoss Zhou was like a fly caught on flypaper. After struggling a few times, he gave up.\n\n\"The Seven Deadly Sins are almost complete, and much better than I anticipated.\"\n\nThe clown stood up. He was not restrained and walked towards Zhou Ze.\n\nSix dots appeared on his black clothes, constantly rotating. Now, only one was missing.\n\nSilverfish,\n\nGreed, Gluttony, Pride, Envy, Wrath.\n\nThe lazy old Zhou was still missing.\n\n\"What exactly are you?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I am not a thing.\"\n\nThe other replied.\n\n\"How honest,\" Zhou Ze was stunned. His honesty was almost pitiable.\n\n\"Only you are left.\"\n\nBeneath the clown mask, there seemed to be a pair of very deep eyes. It was these eyes that could see through people's hearts and coax out their inner desires.\n\nDesire is a ball of fire.\n\nGuiding it out to form a fire dragon,\n\nIs enough to devour the host!\n\nBut the clown also seemed a little confused.\n\nBecause the scene in this bookhouse had a dilapidated and dirty feel, which was far from what he wanted, and also far from what Zhou Ze wanted.\n\nIt seemed there was some mistake in a certain step.\n\nBut even the clown didn't know where the mistake occurred.\n\nIs it because I am still too weak and too tired?\n\n\"Let me fix it.\"\n\nThe clown raised his hand.\n\nThe accumulated water on the floor of the bookhouse began to dissipate.\n\nThe dripping from the ceiling beams gradually disappeared.\n\nThe moldy smell vanished. Everything began to resemble the bookhouse in reality.\n\nZhou Ze watched the clown in front of him, watching him change and adjust, as if watching an executioner choosing Barbie doll accessories for the guillotine.\n\nEverything was just to make the death row inmate's death a little more comfortable.\n\nAfter all, Mr. Zhou, as a ghost messenger, was also a respectable person in life.\n\n\"Will this be better, do you think?\"\n\nThe clown asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and remained silent.\n\nThe clown walked towards Zhou Ze, now less than two meters away. He seemed relieved and fortunate, saying: \"Pure self-immolation is too troublesome. For someone like you, whose self-imagination has been severely hit and whose consciousness is already injured, it is very convenient for me. It's even much easier than dealing with the other few people.\"\n\nZhou Ze tried to reach for the teacup in front of him, but because his back was stuck to the sofa, his hand couldn't reach it.\n\nThe clown picked up the cup for him and placed it in Zhou Ze's hand, very friendly.\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of tea,\n\nCalm and collected.\n\nThe eyes beneath the clown mask seemed to narrow at this moment.\n\nA primal sense of crisis began to surge.\n\nHe didn't know where the sense of crisis came from,\n\nBut he always felt that,\n\nThis time,\n\nSomething seemed a bit off.\n\nBut the clown still spread his palm, and in his palm appeared a fleshy tumor. The tumor wriggled continuously and then slowly split open.\n\nA milky white worm emerged from the tumor. The worm's body began to stretch continuously, gradually elongating to a grotesque degree.\n\nIt was a white worm, but at this moment, it looked a bit like a snake.\n\nIt began to move towards Zhou Ze,\n\nWith a plop,\n\nIt fell into Zhou Ze's teacup.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes showed a hint of disgust.\n\nHe wanted to drink a couple more sips of tea.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nThe white worm's body continued to lengthen, crawling up Zhou Ze's arm, and then reached his chest.\n\nIt was like an explorer, traversing every part of Zhou Ze's body. Wherever it passed, it was incredibly smooth, with a coolness similar to ice, and within this coolness, there was a gentle warmth.\n\nIf you lay down and let it crawl all over your back, it would probably be very comfortable.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and met the gaze of the white worm, musing,\n\n\"Is this for evolution?\"\n\nThe clown seemed a little surprised and slowly said, \"You surprise me. You surprise me so much that I feel as if I have an illusion, making me think you are more than just a ghost messenger.\n\nBut it doesn't matter. After I devour you, I will enter hibernation. When I wake up again, I will begin the next meal.\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze shifted away from the white worm, even though the white worm was trying to burrow into his body.\n\nHe looked out the window.\n\nAt some point,\n\nThe situation in the bookhouse had returned to normal,\n\nBut outside the bookhouse,\n\nThe sunlight was gone.\n\nA bookhouse without sunlight was like a piece of bread without butter – a great pity and a sense of loss.\n\nThe clown's fingers trembled continuously; he was controlling the worm.\n\nThe white worm opened its mouthparts, revealing rows of sharp teeth hidden within, attempting to bite through Zhou Ze's chest and enter it. But for some reason, no matter how hard the white worm tried, it couldn't make any progress, not even breaking Zhou Ze's skin.\n\nThe worm was anxious and angry, but it didn't give up. It continued to bite and tear, like a docile pet hiding in Zhou Ze's embrace, acting coquettish.\n\nThe clown took a deep breath.\n\nHe now,\n\nWas a little flustered.\n\nThen,\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze looking out the window.\n\nHe followed Zhou Ze's gaze.\n\nOutside the window,\n\nIt was no longer sunny.\n\nInstead, it was a swirling turbidity.\n\nIt was as if the entire bookhouse had been placed at the bottom of the sea, becoming an underwater dragon palace.\n\nThe refraction of light became irregular, like the neon lights outside a nightclub entrance late at night.\n\nThe clown retreated several steps.\n\nHe was a little lost,\n\nAnd a little terrified.\n\nBecause he saw in the sea outside the window,\n\nCountless corpse remains were tumbling and swimming.\n\nDirty, sinful, greedy, and violent emotions and auras were being unleashed like they were free, pressing against the glass.\n\nThat sea,\n\nWas the final carnival ground for the undead,\n\nA place of unrestrained... no man's land!\n\nRoaring, bellowing,\n\nGhastly-faced monsters clung to the outside of the window glass, peering in with all their might. They twisted their bodies, bared their large yellow teeth, and trembled their bones.\n\nIf not for the barrier of the glass,\n\nThey would have rushed in long ago to enjoy the freshest blood sacrifice!\n\nThey were hungry,\n\nThey were truly hungry!\n\nThe clown looked at Zhou Ze. This time, his voice had a slight tremor, clearly indicating he was afraid.\n\nAs someone with the ability to control the Seven Deadly Sins, he too felt fear.\n\n\"Who exactly... are you?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out, and the sticky substance on his back had completely dispersed.\n\nLike a mother hen catching a chick,\n\nHe grabbed the white worm that was still wriggling on his chest, trying to burrow in.\n\nHe lifted it and brought it to his face.\n\nThe little worm's body began to shrink.\n\nClearly, it sensed the fear from the clown; there was a deep connection between the two.\n\n\"Want to go in? Don't rush, I'll send you off.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth,\n\nAnd sent the white worm into his mouth.\n\nIt was like swallowing an ice pop on a hot summer day.\n\nThat refreshing sensation, combined with the dizziness in his head,\n\nWas truly intoxicating.\n\n\"Where is this? Why?\"\n\nThe clown began to back away continuously. He tried to open the door behind him, only to find a giant character \"封\" (seal) written on the door of the bookhouse.\n\nHe used all his strength but couldn't open it.\n\nHe was trapped here.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nThe clown realized that,\n\nThe person he had just seen was also trapped here!\n\nHe, like himself,\n\nCould not leave now.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up,\n\nHis eyes sharp and bright,\n\nStaring at the clown.\n\n\"He was knocked unconscious.\n\nWhen you entered,\n\nThat pen deliberately put you here with me.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nZhou Ze began to stretch slowly.\n\nA series of crisp cracks came from his joints.\n\nThen he asked softly,\n\n\"I heard,\n\nYou wanted,\n\nTo eat me?\"",

    "content": "\"A single worm isn't satisfying enough. It's only a way to curb my appetite.\n\nZhou Ze waved at the Clown, as if signaling a waiter for the next course. The Clown began to retreat, but the bookstore was small, where else could he go? So, he made the bookstore disappear, and the space transformed into a desert, with him and Zhou Ze occupying a small oasis less than two hundred square meters within it. All around, sand flowed, carrying a scorching heat.\n\nThe Clown tried to run out, but the moment he stepped, the sand in front of him turned into a high wall, blocking him. The wall was tall, obscuring the sky. Zhou Ze stood in place, hands on his hips, watching the Clown struggle.\n\nThe Clown changed the scenery again. It became a bustling street, with him and Zhou Ze in the middle of it. However, when he attempted to hide in the crowd, the flow of people in front of him suddenly became incredibly dense. People were walking, people were crawling, and if you wanted to squeeze through, you couldn't find a gap! If you tried to jump over people's heads, as soon as you landed, hands would reach out from below, grabbing you and throwing you back to where you started.\n\nHe still couldn't get out. No matter how he changed the scene, he couldn't escape!\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head, his eyes half-closed. He wasn't in a hurry to make a move, instead watching the Clown perform his duties with great interest. *If I could get out, I would have already left. The problem is, there's an idiot.*\n\nThe scene reverted to the original chaos. The Clown and Zhou Ze stood on a gray ground, surrounded by complete darkness. Above them, a large character '封' (fēng - seal/block) floated.\n\nThe Clown despaired; he couldn't get out. Seeing that he had given up, Zhou Ze found it uninteresting. He slowly walked over, strands of black mist spreading from his body, sealing the Clown's limbs. Because of this, even as Zhou Ze got closer, the Clown remained frozen in place.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and removed the mask from the Clown's face. Beneath the mask was an extremely alluring face. This reminded Zhou Ze of the cook in the bookstore owned by his watchdog. *She's really quite good-looking, yet she's a man. Neither feminine nor masculine is the mark of the finest mixed-blood.*\n\nThe Clown's eyes revealed terror. He was very scared, extremely scared. He felt like a little white rabbit that had deliberately hopped into a tiger's den to ask if it had eaten lunch.\n\n\"Don't be afraid...\" Zhou Ze reached out and lightly stroked the Clown's cheek. The Clown became even more frightened, tears even beginning to glisten in his eyes, with many even streaming down. Zhou Ze bent down, took the Clown's hand, and brought it to his lips, making a very gentlemanly kissing gesture.\n\nBut the Clown was not moved by this; instead, he was even more horrified. The scene that followed confirmed the Clown's guess.\n\n\"Crunch... crunch... crunch...\" The crisp sound, if recorded, could be directly used for commercials of snacks like \"Crispy Corn\" or \"Meat on a Stick.\" Zhou Ze chewed on the \"chicken feet\" in front of him, as if playing with an interesting toy. Then, he ate from hand to arm, from arm to chest, from chest to neck...\n\n\"You're getting more and more perverted.\" A voice came. Zhou Ze froze, his eyes then filling with blood-red hues. He looked up and saw a man hanging above, looking down from above the '封' character. That man looked exactly like him.\n\nBoss Zhou's head was covered in blood and gore, in a truly miserable state. He had thought he was finished, but it turned out the most considerate one was the idiot beside him. That Clown was likely that 'Ghost.' The idiot sent the Clown directly to the consciousness within Zhou Ze's body. That consciousness indeed didn't disappoint; the so-called Seven Deadly Sins had no effect on it, as it was inherently a concentrated entity of brutality. However, the sight of this slow gnawing still made Zhou Ze's scalp tingle. He preferred the previous one who swallowed him whole; that felt more intimate.\n\nThe Zhou Ze below, who was feasting, suddenly erupted in rage. The feeling was like a teenage boy hiding in his room, fumbling with a lighter, when suddenly teachers and classmates burst into his house to give him a surprise birthday party. His most shameful moment being witnessed by the watchdog naturally made him furious! He lunged forward, roaring and yelling at the '封' character, striking it with all his might.\n\nThe '封' character began to tremble, with some strokes dissipating, but the idiot beside him would immediately come up to reinforce them, drawing them back. Boss Zhou, wiping the blood from his head, laughed, \"This feels good. From now on, if anyone uses illusions or anything similar on me, I'll just knock myself out, and you can deal with them then.\"\n\n\"You... you wish...\"\n\n\"Tsk, don't rush, we're in the same body. Helping me is helping yourself.\"\n\n\"Unseal... unseal...\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll help you unseal it. Idiot, come over here quickly.\"\n\nThe idiot immediately arrived. \"This stroke is a bit faint. Draw more, make it deeper. Don't be afraid of wasting ink. At worst, I'll eat more later and buy some ginseng and cordyceps to replenish my blood and qi. Just create to your heart's content.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Boss Zhou waved to the one below, \"Thanks, I need to wake up. I'll see you again next time. But it's really quite unexpected. With this brush, it feels like it's brought us closer. In this way, can we be considered... pen pals?\"\n\nThe roaring continued, the anger escalating, but Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered with the guy below. He closed his eyes.\n\n...\n\nHe opened his eyes. A clearer and more intense stinging, dizzying sensation hit him. Boss Zhou sat up from the ground, then clutched his chest and dry-heaved for about ten minutes. When he stood up, he still felt the ground shaking, his steps unsteady. \"Could I have a concussion? And it doesn't look like a mild one.\" Being a doctor in his previous life, Zhou Ze knew that concussions could be minor or major and were quite tricky.\n\nHe bent over and, after recovering for a few more minutes, Zhou Ze finally stood up straight. In front of him, Gu He was already cold, thoroughly cold. As a constable, if he had immediately sought to remedy the situation after enduring Zhou Ze's piercing strike, he might have survived. After all, though his body was that of an ordinary person, his soul wasn't; he could always think of a way. Unfortunately, after he fell, he was invaded by shadows, which directly led to his demise. This was the vulnerability of ghost envoys; their bodies were fundamentally those of ordinary people. Back then, when the little萝莉¹ transformed into her true form to scare the driver, he had stepped on the accelerator and rammed into her. If Zhou Ze hadn't been at the hospital at that time, retrieving his original spouse, the little 萝莉 might have directly kicked the bucket and reported to hell.\n\n\"The soul is gone too?\" Zhou Ze couldn't sense a soul from Gu He. Without further thought, he walked a few more steps forward. Zheng Qiang also lay on the ground, but his chest showed slight undulations, even though his entire body had become skin and bones. However, this guy was still alive. Because the Clown was eaten within Zhou Ze, his activities in other bodies also stopped.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pressed down hard on Zheng Qiang's chest. \"Hey, are you okay?\" he shouted urgently, but deliberately didn't hold back, thinking to let the guy suffocate, saving him trouble. He could then pocket the ghost envoy certificate and be happy. Partnering with Lawyer An in the human trafficking business, the more ghost envoy certificates, the better.\n\nHowever, the slap from Zhou Ze actually woke Zheng Qiang up. He opened his eyes, looked at Zhou Ze, and smiled, saying, \"Thank you... for saving me...\" Boss Zhou hesitated for a moment, and finally didn't strangle the guy again. He got up and walked towards the other staircase, starting to descend.\n\nLi Sen was as dead as dead could be. His jealousy had been too intense, burning him to death in an instant. But there was still one more, that needle-eyed girl. If she died, he would collect the ghost envoy certificate. Those silver and gold needles also looked good; he'd take those too. Yingying² could do some needlework if she got bored later. Boss Zhou was quite thrifty at this moment.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked over, he found Yue Ya lying on the ground, but without any obvious injuries. Getting closer, Zhou Ze smiled. No breath. She was dead. Zhou Ze's hands began to search her body. Where were the needles? The gold and silver needles. After searching for a long time, Zhou Ze finally felt something hard and long. With a strong pull, a long needle was extracted by Zhou Ze. *Holy crap, that's a huge needle, as long as two adult palms.*\n\nAfter this needle was pulled out, several more needles appeared on Yue Ya's neck and chest. These needles began to float out on their own, but no blood flowed, and no obvious wounds were visible. As these needles emerged, Yue Ya's eyelids began to flutter. Zhou Ze suddenly realized, *She's not dead? Is this a life-saving spell where she used these needles to lock her body and soul in advance?* Of course, if Zhou Ze hadn't eaten the Clown, Yue Ya wouldn't have been able to hide it and would have died. This spell was essentially gambling on hope.\n\nBoss Zhou hesitated, wondering if he should use the needle in his hand to stab her to death. Somehow, perhaps due to mutual influence, Boss Zhou's first instinct when seeing a ghost envoy now was to kill him.\n\nSuddenly, tears began to stream from Yue Ya's eyes. As if speaking in her sleep, she murmured, \"I'm sorry... I can't have children... I'm sorry... Don't leave me...\" After the anger came a despairing desolation.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, put down the needle in his hand, smacked his lips, and comforted her, \"Alright, if you can't have them, you can't. It's not like there's a throne to inherit anyway.\"\n\n---\n¹ 萝莉 (luólì): Japanese loanword for \"loli,\" a young girl.\n² 莺莺 (Yīngyīng): A classical Chinese literary character, known for her beauty and poetic talents.",

Regardless of education level, wealth, or social status, everyone would eventually have to seek employment in the Underworld.\n\nEvery deceased person had something pitiable about them.\n\nThe word \"human\" could sometimes transcend the levels of \"animal\" or \"life\" and elevate to the realm of \"thought.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt he was still human because he still thought with a human mindset. As long as one was human, they had weaknesses.\n\nThe ghost wearing the clown mask, using the Seven Deadly Sins, had almost annihilated the entire ghost envoy squad. This showed that even ghost envoys couldn't escape their \"human\" weaknesses.\n\nYueya crying about being unable to have children was quite amusing to think about.\n\nThe obsessions from a past life couldn't be let go of in this life, instead becoming knots of resentment buried deep in the heart.\n\nBoss Zhou suddenly felt a sense of \"everyone else is drunk, but I am sober.\"\n\nHe recalled his past life, being diligent and hardworking, dreaming of improving his skills and climbing the ladder. He had lived a life that was so tiring and arduous.\n\nThis life, he could be carefree, sunbathing and drinking tea.\n\nZhou Ze never considered himself \"lazy\"; instead, he believed he possessed true \"willingness to let go\" and \"broad-mindedness.\"\n\nOf course,\n\nUltimately,\n\nIt was because Boss Zhou had been unconscious earlier\n\nand hadn't noticed the large character \"Lazy\" that had appeared on his forehead.\n\nIn the face of conclusions, all self-satisfaction and refutations lost their meaning.\n\nHe took out his phone and dialed Director Lin's number. The call rang a few times before being hung up.\n\nSoon, a message was replied:\n\n\"Busy.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, if a doctor enters the operating room for minor surgeries like circumcision or appendectomy, it's fine.\n\nHowever, for major surgeries that require serious concentration, communication devices like mobile phones are definitely not allowed in the operating room.\n\nOtherwise, while everyone is performing delicate surgery like replantation of severed fingers, suddenly a song might start playing, \"Get up, cheer for the new record, get up...\"\n\nBut Director Lin likely had her own privileges. After all, besides being a doctor, she was also responsible for the hospital's management and operations.\n\nBoss Zhou dutifully replied with a message:\n\n\"There are a few injured people. I need a few people and a car to help deal with them.\"\n\nSince he couldn't bring himself to kill and steal from Yueya and Zheng Qiang,\n\nhe couldn't just leave them here to fend for themselves.\n\nHe had to call for people to transport them, and their physical condition was very poor, requiring surgery.\n\nAlso, the bodies of Li Sen and Gu He needed to be dealt with. Otherwise, when the \"flowers of the motherland\"<sup>1</sup> came to class the next morning,\n\nit wouldn't be a good thing to see two corpses lying there.\n\nAfter a while, a message was replied from the other side:\n\n\"Next to you, 150XXXXXXXX.\"\n\nBoss Zhou pondered for a moment what \"next to you\" meant.\n\nHis head had just been hit hard, so his thoughts were naturally a bit scattered.\n\nAfter thinking for a long time, Zhou Ze finally understood.\n\n\"Next to you\" actually meant \"literally next door.\"\n\nHad the pharmacy next to the bookstore finished its renovation and started operating?\n\nBoss Zhou suddenly felt a little embarrassed. That pharmacy was opened by Director Lin for him, but he hadn't paid much attention to it.\n\nHe dialed the number from the message.\n\nA sweet female voice answered the phone:\n\n\"Hello, this is Baixing Pharmacy.\"\n\nIt was late at night, and someone was answering the phone?\n\nWait a minute,\n\nBaixing Pharmacy?\n\nCouldn't they pick a less tacky name?\n\n\"How many people can you get out of your pharmacy right now?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe sweet voice paused, seemingly unable to understand Zhou Ze's question.\n\nZhou Ze's question was like a drunk idiot calling the wrong number to ask how many girls were available for hire.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir, we are a pharmacy, we don't offer house calls.\n\n(′?`) Huh!!!\"\n\nThe girl seemed to have noticed Zhou Ze's number and then said with surprise:\n\n\"Is it you, Boss? We have your phone number recorded here. Someone from above told us that the Boss was attending a seminar abroad recently, so you couldn't come back for the time being.\"\n\nAttending a seminar abroad?\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment.\n\nHe was right next door.\n\n\"How many people can you get out? Do you have a car? Preferably an ambulance.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss, our pharmacy is equipped with a brand-new medical ambulance. Including me, there are two male doctors and two nurses.\"\n\n\"So, you can confirm my identity, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, Boss, we have your phone number recorded here, but we were instructed not to disturb you proactively.\"\n\n\"Okay, how about this: you prepare an operating room there, and also, go to the bookstore next to your pharmacy, the one that should be open and operating now, and tell the people inside that Zhou Ze is calling them to Tongcheng University. Your people don't need to come. Just lend them the ambulance.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nThe girl hung up the phone.\n\nNot long after, Zhou Ze's phone rang. It was Xu Qinglang's call.\n\n\"Where did you run off to in the middle of the night, and asked me to bring an ambulance? Playing dress-up?\"\n\n\"I'm asking you to come help me collect bodies.\"\n\n\"Damn!\"\n\n...\n\nAbout twenty minutes later,\n\nXu Qinglang, the old Daoist, and the Death Warrior<sup>2</sup> sneaked into this teaching building. As Zhou Ze had instructed earlier, the ambulance was parked outside the school fence. It wasn't appropriate to drive in through the main gate in a fanfare.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the steps, smoking. Seeing them arrive, he nodded and picked up Yueya himself,\n\ngesturing:\n\n\"There are three more. Take them all.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was quick. He picked up Zheng Qiang, who was still semi-conscious, onto his back.\n\nThe Death Warrior didn't care and picked up Gu He's body.\n\nThe old Daoist looked around, trying to find another Yueya to carry, but found that all the good ones had been taken. In the end, he could only helplessly give Boss a middle finger in his heart,\n\nand picked up Li Sen, who had been burned to charcoal.\n\nThe four of them, along with the people on their backs, moved like thieves, sneaking out of the teaching building.\n\nThere was a small gap in the fence where the ambulance was parked.\n\nIt was probably pried open by students for convenience to pick up takeout. It seemed that for a period, the school, to protect the sales of its on-campus restaurants that they had paid for, prohibited all delivery drivers from entering the campus through any gate.\n\nBut where there is oppression, there is resistance.\n\nThis gap in the iron fence, pried open by the students themselves, was the best proof.\n\nThey all got into the car, and the car stopped halfway.\n\nThe old Daoist and the Death Warrior, each carrying their respective corpses, got out of the car in a secluded spot. They needed to dispose of the bodies.\n\nZhou Ze, however, took the ambulance directly back to the bookstore... next door.\n\nThe mysterious pharmacy owner's first appearance, bringing two seriously injured individuals, made the two doctors and two nurses in the pharmacy seem a bit excited.\n\nBut the boss only took the nurse who answered the phone and went into the operating room with her, sending everyone else to rest.\n\nThe surgery wasn't difficult, even though the nurse assistant next to him watched with sparkling eyes.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze's efficiency and superb skills on the operating table were fully displayed.\n\nAfter all, every industry has the phenomenon of laymen leading experts. The most typical example is Chinese football. One moment they appoint someone who plays badminton as the chairman of the Football Association, and the next they want someone who came from table tennis to be the chairman. Perhaps in the eyes of the leaders, they are all balls, and anyone can play with balls.\n\nHospitals have similar situations, but ultimately, hospitals are still relatively pure places. After all, true skill and true status are earned on the operating table, and it's based on strength. Therefore, highly skilled doctors in hospitals are truly valued and hold significant status.\n\nYueya's problem wasn't major. A few needles hadn't been removed, so Zhou Ze surgically removed them and bandaged her wounds.\n\nZheng Qiang had several fractures, and some barbs were embedded in his flesh. It took some effort to remove them. Most importantly, this guy clearly seemed to have overdosed on drugs, and his physical condition was not good.\n\nHowever, relying on the strong mental willpower of a ghost envoy, he should be able to pull through.\n\nAfter completing both surgeries, Zhou Ze was drenched in sweat. Having been idle for too long, and not being on the operating table for a long time, although his skills hadn't dulled, and even due to his special experiences, Zhou Ze's understanding of the human body's structure and his attitude towards life had been elevated, even feeling more proficient artistically.\n\nBut doing two surgeries in a row still made Boss Zhou feel a little tired.\n\nHe recalled his diligent years back then, performing surgeries all day long, even dreaming of performing surgeries while sleeping at home.\n\nAlas,\n\nHe really couldn't go back.\n\nThe sweet-voiced nurse poured Zhou Ze a cup of tea.\n\nZhou Ze sat on a chair nearby, sipping his tea while observing Yueya and Zheng Qiang's recovery.\n\n\"Boss, how did you find these two injured people?\"\n\n\"I ran into them.\"\n\n\"Did they commit suicide? Why would they commit suicide?\"\n\nThe sweet-voiced nurse was like a curious baby.\n\n\"The woman, because she was infertile, couldn't take it, and committed suicide.\"\n\n\"Oh, how cruel! Stabbing herself with needles. What about the man?\"\n\n\"He was also infertile, couldn't take it, and committed suicide.\"\n\n\"So, they agreed to commit suicide together?\"\n\nZhou Ze perfunctorily nodded.\n\n\"By the way, what is this?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the table nearby. There were still soup stains left on it.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nEven the scream of the sweet little nurse was so pleasant to hear.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Boss. Because... because we haven't seen you, and usually only people come to buy medicine, so we were eating in this operating room before.\"\n\n\"Take it away. Don't do it again.\"\n\nThe environment of the operating room is very important.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nBoss Zhou had germophobia, especially in this regard.\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nThe sweet-voiced nurse picked up the four-person table with one hand.\n\nIt was a stainless steel table.\n\nShe walked out energetically.\n\nLooking at her ample and large back,\n\nwith a chest heavy enough to crack walnuts,\n\nshe was estimated to be around 250 pounds.\n\nGenerally speaking,\n\nchubby girls have nice voices.\n\nAnd they sing well too.\n\nBoss Zhou took a sip of tea,\n\nrecalling the other freckled, thin female nurse he saw when he came in.\n\nHe thought about Director Lin, who wore a white coat and black silk stockings underneath.\n\nHe shook his head,\n\n\"Heh,\n\nwomen.\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> \"Flowers of the motherland\" is a term often used in Chinese propaganda to refer to young students.\n<sup>2</sup> \"死侍\" (sǐ shì) literally translates to \"Death Guard\" or \"Death Warrior.\" In this context, it seems to be a character name or title.",

    "content": "The moon was dark, the wind was high,\nThe perfect time for disposing of a body!\nThe old Taoist priest squatted under a tree, smoking,\nBeside him, the Death Eater¹ dug the earth with a small shovel.\nThe Death Eater was a simpleton, a model employee; whatever the old Taoist told him to do, he did. The old Taoist was used to it.\nThe old Taoist followed the boss's lead, inheriting the boss's spirit and qualities: if he could be lazy, he would be lazy.\nNo need to worry about the guy getting tired.\nInsects were plentiful in this area on a summer night,\nThe Death Eater ate them as he dug, happy as could be.\nAfter finishing a cigarette, he stomped it out on the ground. The old Taoist suddenly noticed his palm was black and, with some disgust, wiped his hand on the bark of a tree.\nSeeing it wasn't clean,\nHe spat twice into his palm and rubbed his hands together,\nThen wiped them again.\nTurning back, he glanced at the pit the Death Eater had dug and called out,\n\"That's about enough, bury them.\"\nAlthough disposing of bodies like this was a bit too casual, they could burn some spirit money back at the temple. Besides, they hadn't killed the people themselves.\nAnd to be honest, the police weren't all Sherlock Holmeses. Let alone how long it would take for the bodies to be discovered, even if they were found, with so many years passed, finding the murderers wasn't very realistic.\nLi Heitan² was tossed in first by the old Taoist.\n\"Li Sen, don't choose this name in your next life. Four 'wood' radicals³—no wonder you burned so intensely.\"\nNext was Gu He.\n\"Still a constable⁴? Seems no different from a ghost messenger.\"\nThe two bodies were tossed in.\nThe old Taoist pointed at the Death Eater,\n\"Fill the pit!\"\nThe Death Eater immediately started filling the pit.\nAfter filling the pit,\nThe old Taoist carefully added some weeds and debris nearby, trying to cover up any signs of disturbed earth.\nHaving done this, the old Taoist and the Death Eater left together.\nAbout a quarter of an hour later,\nThe freshly filled earth was overturned,\nA hand emerged,\nAnd after much strenuous wriggling,\nThe soil was completely broken through.\nGu He, his chest nearly filled with dirt, crawled out.\nGu He's body was stiff, but his eyes were clear.\nHe gasped for air towards the sky,\n\"To think I fell for his trick without realizing it.\"\nConstable Gu He sighed inwardly. As a constable, he had suffered such a great fall. If it weren't for his Hibernation Technique⁵ and his ability to seal his soul's aura, that ghost messenger from Tongcheng might actually have killed him.\nAfter all, his ghost messenger certificate,\nHad been taken by him.\nGu He gritted his teeth and forced himself to stand. He didn't dare, like Zheng Qiang, foolishly announce he was still alive. He couldn't risk it, risking that the other party would be merciful and remember their camaraderie.\nBesides,\nHe had no camaraderie with the other party.\nBecause he had been tricked beforehand,\nHe had nearly led these ghost messengers into a trap with him.\nThey probably hated him dearly.\nThe relationship between ghost messengers was simple and straightforward: when there were benefits, they all went for it; if you were sick, they took your place.\n\"Damn it, my phone and wallet were also swiped.\"\nGu He cursed.\nHe was so weak he could barely stand. And with a wound like the hole in his chest, he couldn't possibly go to a hospital, or they would mistake him for a strange creature and send him to a research institute for dissection.\nAt that moment,\nHe could only crawl on the ground using his hands and feet,\nTrying to get away from here first.\n\"Yo! Yo! Yo!\"\nThe old Taoist's voice came from behind Gu He.\nGu He stiffened and turned his head to look at the old Taoist behind him.\nHow did he come back?\n\"According to the settings in brain-dead dramas, if someone is buried alive in a supernatural theme, the buried person will definitely find a way to cause some trouble and crawl out.\"\nThe old Taoist wiggled his hips.\n\"See? I found you anyway.\"\nThe Death Eater also appeared from another direction, licking his lips at Gu He.\n\"I'm a constable, what do you want?\"\nGu He asked, feigning composure.\n\"Constable, so what? I'm the reincarnation of the Lord of Mount Tai⁶, do you believe me?\"\nThe old Taoist chuckled.\nThen he pointed at the Death Eater,\n\"The boss has ordered, kill him.\"\nThe old Taoist was an ordinary person. Although he was still strong now and could protect the fallen from time to time,\nHe would eventually go to hell. Therefore, it was most appropriate to let the Death Eater handle such matters, as he had no soul anyway.\nThe Death Eater stepped forward and grabbed Gu He's shoulders.\nGu He was very weak now, extremely weak. Otherwise, he wouldn't have pretended to be dead in front of Zhou Ze, trying to get away with it.\n\"How did he discover me?\" Gu He was still asking.\n\"Uh-huh, the boss sent me a text message saying you might not be dead,\" the old Taoist shrugged. \"I can't say why the boss knew you weren't dead.\"\nGu He suddenly understood.\nHe remembered.\nIt was because of the ghost messenger certificate.\nAfter the original owner of the ghost messenger certificate died,\nThe certificate would automatically become the lowest-level credential.\nEven a judge's certificate would be the same.\nThat guy took his ghost messenger certificate. He must have discovered that his certificate was still marked as \"Constable,\" which made him suspicious that he wasn't dead.\n\"Call your boss and tell him I have something to discuss with him. Tell him that if he kills me, he'll only get an ordinary ghost messenger certificate, but if he doesn't kill me, I can give him...\"\n\"Kill.\"\nThe old Taoist didn't want to exchange more words with the constable.\nMoreover, he thought the boss was also too lazy to exchange more words with him.\nHe directly signaled the Death Eater to carry out the killing, while reminding him:\n\"Remember to eat his soul, don't let him go to hell.\"\nThe Death Eater immediately exerted his strength, intending to snap Gu He's neck.\nBut Gu He's neck suddenly bulged at this moment,\nThen,\nA ball of flame erupted from his throat.\nThe Death Eater was burned face-to-face, dramatically let go, and hopped around in extreme pain.\nActually,\nThe damage from this flame to the Death Eater wasn't great, as Gu He was already at his last breath. But the Death Eater feared nothing else, he just feared fire!\nDeep in his heart, he had a profound fear of fire!\nBecause his predecessor, that Japanese priest, had been burned alive by Zhou Ze with gasoline, nearly turning him into ashes.\nSeeing this, the old Taoist immediately took out a talisman. This time, he didn't take it from his crotch.\nBecause the old Taoist knew,\nIf he stuck a talisman from his crotch onto the Death Eater,\nIt would be like saying he wanted the Death Eater to die even more painfully.\nXu Qinglang⁷ had been very diligent recently, drawing many talismans. Although these talismans weren't very powerful, they were still somewhat useful.\nThe old Taoist took out a talisman drawn by Xu Qinglang. This talisman was a failed product. It was said to be a water-element talisman, but it could only be used to water flowers.\n\"Water Dragon's Roar!\"⁸\nThe old Taoist struck a pose, bit his finger, and smeared blood on the talisman. At the same time, he glanced sideways, seeing that Gu He, who had just spewed fire, was still lying on the ground, unable to move, he felt relieved to first help the Death Eater extinguish the fire.\n\"Splat!\"\nAbout half a basin of water splashed out.\n\"...\" The old Taoist.\nThis name was so imposing, but could the effect be any more useless?\nIf Xu Qinglang were in front of the old Taoist now,\nThe old Taoist would have wanted to punch him.\nBecause even though it was a failed product, Xu Qinglang hadn't explicitly told the old Taoist. Instead, he had said that if the old Taoist performed the spell correctly and activated it with his own blood, he could summon a water dragon.\nHalf a basin of water,\nAnd you dare to call it a water dragon?\nIt was a good thing I noticed it in time. If I encountered a situation where I needed to use this talisman in the future, I would have died such a frustrating death!\n\"My good sir, don't rush to kill me, let me sprinkle some little water on you?\"\n\"Then continue killing me after I sprinkle the little water?\"\nFortunately,\nGu He probably really had no strength left, and the fire extinguished after burning for a while.\nWithout the fire,\nThe Death Eater immediately got up.\nAlthough many areas were scorched,\nIt wasn't a big problem for the Death Eater. At this moment, new skin was already growing to replace the scorched skin. Such vitality was terrifying!\nNow, the Death Eater had no hesitation. He opened his mouth and gnawed at Gu He's remains!\nVery violent,\nVery direct!\nYou dare to set me on fire?\nThen I'll eat you!\n\"Crunch! Crunch! Crunch!!!\"\nBlue light kept emanating from Gu He's body, but it was all absorbed into the Death Eater's mouth. That was Gu He's weak soul.\nThe old Taoist watched from the side, feeling that the Death Eater was a bit frightening at this moment.\nBefore, he only ate insects, which was nothing. It was like a pure, natural, green mosquito repellent. But after this, if he got addicted to eating people, how would he be raised in the future?\nThis needed to be reported to the boss after returning.\nAfter the Death Eater gnawed Gu He until only remnants were left and his soul was completely devoured, the old Taoist clapped his hands with satisfaction, reburied the body, and then left with the Death Eater.\nAfter about an hour,\nThe old Taoist and the Death Eater ran back from the haystack in the distance. They had made a surprise return visit!\nSeeing that there were no anomalies, they left again.\nAs dawn approached,\nThe old Taoist and the Death Eater ran back again. Another surprise return visit!\nThe dirt was still there; it hadn't been disturbed again.\n\"Hoo...\"\nThe old Taoist breathed a sigh of relief.\nIt seemed he was truly dead this time.\nTaking out his phone, for the sake of caution, the old Taoist called the boss. Zhou Ze gave a positive reply.\nBecause Gu He's ghost messenger certificate had already been downgraded to the lowest level, the underworld's judgment was infallible. Zhou Ze also told the old Taoist to hurry back with the Death Eater.\n\"Alright, alright, let's go home and sleep. And you, go back, brush your teeth, shower, and then go to the bedroom. Brush your teeth many times.\" The old Taoist reminded the Death Eater.\nHe shared a room with the Death Eater and couldn't stand the smell of blood in the room when he woke up.\nThe Death Eater nodded and walked back with the old Taoist.\nThe rising sun had already appeared,\nIts radiance shone down,\nReflecting the bloody residue in the Death Eater's teeth,\nGlistening.\nThe Death Eater unconsciously licked the gaps between his teeth with his tongue,\nSucking in the bits of flesh and blood,\nHe felt the taste was exceptionally delicious and extremely memorable.\nIf the old Taoist hadn't insisted on going back immediately,\nHe really wanted to dig up Gu He's corpse again,\nAnd eat him again.\nReally,\nSo delicious.\n\n---\n¹ Death Eater: A direct translation of \"死侍\" (sǐ shì).

    "content": "The master bedroom on the second floor of the bookstore.\n\nThe bed was not covered with a cooling mat, but rather a soft mattress with dark sheets and a thick pillow.\n\nThe beds in the other rooms of the bookstore were usually fitted with cooling mats, but this room did not need one.\n\nBai Yingying and the little girl were lying on the bed.\n\nThe little girl had been asleep, but Zhou Ze returned late in the night. Bai Yingying went down to attend to him for a while, which forced the little girl to wake up as well.\n\nBeing forcibly woken up when you're in a deep sleep is truly unpleasant, but she couldn't complain.\n\nAfter all, she was just crashing there and had no rights.\n\nBai Yingying was wearing a silver slip dress, the kind that only a woman with a curvaceous figure could truly pull off.\n\nThe little girl, on the other hand, was wearing red pajamas and staring at the ceiling with her eyes wide open, pouting.\n\n\"Stupid zombie, he's just back, he must have gone out to find women!\"\n\nWhen she was in a bad mood, she liked to badmouth Mr. Zhou to others.\n\nOf course, even when she was in a good mood, she might still badmouth Mr. Zhou.\n\n\"Mhmm.\"\n\nBai Yingying was unconcerned.\n\nThe little girl hugged Bai Yingying's arm, her toes constantly rubbing against Bai Yingying's thigh. To be honest, this female zombie was incredibly smooth to the touch, and it felt really comfortable to hug her while sleeping.\n\nSo, every night after everyone fell asleep, the little girl would fight with Zhou Ze for Bai Yingying's embrace. But being small, she often ended up with both herself and Bai Yingying being held by their boss.\n\n\"Stupid zombie, men are all big pig trotters¹ and can't be trusted!\"\n\n\"Mhmm.\"\n\n\"Look at him, he was in surgery for so long. He must have finished ages ago and was flirting with the nurses in the pharmacy next door.\n\nMaybe he even had them wear their nurse uniforms in the operating room and went at it.\n\nNo,\n\nit was one round after another!\"\n\nAfter thinking about it, the little girl added:\n\n\"He probably made the nurses wear stockings!\n\nMost big pig trotters like stockings.\"\n\nBai Yingying looked at the little girl with some surprise.\n\nPerhaps because the little girl rarely left the bookstore, she hadn't met the people from the pharmacy next door.\n\nBut Bai Yingying had.\n\nWhen the pharmacy opened, the people next door had sent gifts. Bai Yingying, representing the bookstore, had sent a flower basket and even stayed for a while.\n\nAfter all, this was their boss's property.\n\nAlthough they were nominally gifts given to the boss upon his acquisition, since they bore the \"Zhou\" family name, Bai Yingying felt she had a responsibility to look after the pharmacy for her boss.\n\nBai Yingying, who already considered herself the future head wife, possessed this magnanimity!\n\nBecause of this, Bai Yingying knew the two nurses next door, one named Fang Fang and the other Xiao Cao.\n\nFang Fang was large-bodied, the type with a sumo wrestler's physique, while Xiao Cao was extremely thin, flat in the front and flat in the back, like a bamboo pole.\n\nTheir boss played dress-up with them in the operating room,\n\nand went at it round after round?\n\nBai Yingying fell into deep thought.\n\nThe boss's taste shouldn't be so terrifying!\n\n\"Big pig trotters are all like that. In his eyes, the little nurses who came with the pharmacy he acquired are like dowry maids given to him. In ancient times, dowry maids were also taken into the household as secondary wives.\n\nThe little girl analyzed carefully for Bai Yingying: \"Because this way, they can help their mistress secure favor in her husband's house. One good man needs three helpers, right? After all, they are the personal maids brought by their mistress. Even if they are taken in as concubines, when facing alluring vixens from outside later, they will definitely be on the same side as their mistress!\n\nYes,\n\nthat's definitely how it is.\n\nThose two little nurses are like the advance troops sent by that woman named Lin, attempting to establish a foothold first, and then await the king's army!\"\n\nBai Yingying couldn't help but picture Director Lin's figure in her mind.\n\nWith Fang Fang and Xiao Cao accompanying her,\n\nit just felt so awkward no matter how she thought about it.\n\nDid Director Lin find two helpers, or two dullards?\n\n\"Lin Ke.\"\n\n\"What is it, stupid zombie?\"\n\n\"I think, someone like a concubine...\"\n\n\"Mhmm?\"\n\n\"Someone like you seems more like it.\"\n\nLin Ke's negative emotions +999!!!\n\nStupid zombie,\n\nyou've changed.\n\nYou're actually fighting back now!\n\nOf course,\n\neven though she was angrily called a concubine,\n\nshe still wasn't getting out of bed!\n\n\"Men are all big pig trotters anyway, big pig trotters, big pig trotters ahhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nThe little girl buried her head in the covers and shouted.\n\n\"Pig trotters?\" At this moment, the bedroom door was pushed open. Zhou Ze, who had just showered, walked in. \"Did you guys eat pig trotters tonight?\"\n\n\"Boss, it's time to rest.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately arranged the pillows beside her and smoothed the bedsheets.\n\nZhou Ze got into bed and casually patted the little girl.\n\nThe little girl's body trembled.\n\nShe felt humiliated and was so angry, but she still wasn't getting out of bed!\n\nTo hell with you,\n\nbig pig trotter!\n\nZhou Ze lay down.\n\nHe was indeed a bit tired. Dealing with school matters and two surgeries had really worn him out.\n\nNot long after lying down,\n\nZhou Ze fell asleep.\n\nBai Yingying turned on her side, looking at Mr. Zhou's sleeping face, and closed her own eyes.\n\n...\n\nZombies do not need to sleep, but that does not mean they cannot. In fact, for the previous two hundred years, Bai Yingying had been lying in her coffin.\n\nFrom time to time, Madam Bai might come to see her and talk to her, but most of the time, Bai Yingying could only stay alone in the darkness underground.\n\nIf she couldn't sleep,\n\nthat life\n\nwould be nothing but endless torment.\n\nBai Yingying found it somewhat strange that\n\nafter falling asleep today,\n\nshe actually had a dream.\n\nShe rarely dreamed because her mind was always very calm. With no thoughts, there were naturally no dreams at night.\n\nTherefore, dreaming, something so normal for ordinary people, was something she could forget about upon waking. But for Bai Yingying, at least in her previous two hundred years, having a dream was enough for her to savor repeatedly for a long time.\n\nIn the dream,\n\nBai Yingying was wearing a red wedding dress,\n\nher head adorned with gold and silver. She squatted by a pond, looking at her reflection. Her makeup was luxurious, she was dressed entirely as a bride going to be married.\n\nShe was even captivated by her own beauty.\n\nBai Yingying stood up and walked forward.\n\nAhead,\n\na white marble bridge appeared.\n\nRows of guards stood there,\n\nstanding ramrod straight,\n\nmeticulously.\n\nAs Bai Yingying walked past, she was surprised to find that one of the guards looked very much like Deathstroke. To be precise, he was Deathstroke.\n\nBai Yingying even waved at Deathstroke and greeted him.\n\nBut Deathstroke remained unmoved, as if he didn't recognize her at all.\n\nThere was also a guard who looked like Zhang Yanfeng next to him. Bai Yingying also waved. Zhang Yanfeng also ignored her.\n\nBai Yingying pouted and, driven by curiosity, continued forward.\n\nAs she walked, a group of palace maids approached her, holding a canopy over her and scattering flowers to pave her way.\n\nAmong the palace maids,\n\nBai Yingying saw Xu Qinglang and Lin Wanqiu.\n\nBai Yingying was slightly taken aback,\n\nthen tightened her jaw.\n\nShe wanted to laugh,\n\nbut couldn't.\n\nShe had to hold back,\n\nshe had to hold back,\n\nhold back!\n\n*Sob sob sob!*\n\nThis consort wishes to rule the empire, to rule the empire!!!\n\nThe palace maids escorted the Empress, walking forward together.\n\nSeeing Director Lin and Xu Qinglang, who were obediently walking ahead of her,\n\nYingying felt a sense of accomplishment and superiority!\n\nContinuing forward,\n\nshe saw civil and military officials prostrating themselves.\n\nThe man at the forefront, wearing general's armor, was Lawyer An.\n\nLawyer An knelt respectfully, not daring to lift his head too high.\n\nBai Yingying, maintaining her dignity, continued forward.\n\nThe weather was beautiful,\n\nmusic played melodiously,\n\nthe scene was grand.\n\nYingying herself was somewhat intoxicated.\n\nContinuing forward,\n\nshe saw an old eunuch with a group of eunuchs standing at the entrance of the great hall. This old eunuch's clothes were different from those of the other eunuchs. The other eunuchs wore gray-blue clothes, while he wore purple.\n\nIt was clear he wasn't an ordinary eunuch!\n\nAt least a chief eunuch!\n\nAnd this chief eunuch was the old Taoist priest.\n\nThe old Taoist priest waved his horsetail whisk,\n\nand with a high-pitched voice shouted:\n\n\"Welcome, Empress, to the palace!\"\n\nAfter shouting,\n\nthe old Taoist priest also knelt down.\n\n\"This humble servant pays his respects to the Empress.\"\n\nBai Yingying extended her hand, signaling the old Taoist priest to rise.\n\nThen,\n\nBai Yingying walked into the great hall.\n\nThe great hall was spacious,\n\nfilled with red candles,\n\ndecorated festively.\n\nIncense burners wafted,\n\nemitting a refreshing scent.\n\nIn the very center of the great hall was a large bed, covered with red silk, with gauzy curtains. A gentle breeze blew, rustling them, as if it could even stir one's heartstrings.\n\nA man dressed in a groom's outfit sat by the bed.\n\nUnlike before,\n\nthis time,\n\nit was the man who was wearing the red veil.\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty, lift the veil!\"\n\nA young palace maid beside her offered a jade ruyi, which was used to lift the red veil.\n\nThe young palace maid looked exactly like Lin Ke and was extremely respectful to her at this moment.\n\nBai Yingying was so excited!\n\nAll the way here,\n\nshe had seen Deathstroke, seen the old Taoist priest, seen Lawyer An, Old Xu, Officer Zhang, and others.\n\nNow,\n\nonly one was missing!\n\nHe,\n\nwas sitting by the bed,\n\nwaiting for her to lift his red veil,\n\nto let her feast her eyes on his face,\n\nand then,\n\nshe would enjoy passionate moments with him on the bed!\n\nThis was truly,\n\na beautiful dream.\n\nIn her dream,\n\nshe should feel hot inside, right?\n\nMmm-hmm,\n\nit must be so!\n\nBai Yingying walked a few steps forward,\n\nextended the jade ruyi,\n\nand slowly lifted the man's red veil, filled with intense anticipation.\n\nBut when the red veil was lifted,\n\nthe excited expression on Bai Yingying's face instantly froze.\n\nAfter the red veil was lifted,\n\nsitting before her,\n\nwas indeed a groom,\n\nbut the groom's head, originally hidden by the red veil,\n\nwas a big pig trotter!\n\nBig pig trotter!\n\nBig pig trotter!\n\nBig pig trotter!\n\nLin Ke,\n\nI'm going to kill you!\n\nFor telling me \"big pig trotter\" all the time before bed!\n\nThe boss has really turned into a big pig trotter now!!!\n\nAhhhhhhh!!!!\n\nYou owe me back my big pig trotter,\n\nno,\n\nyou owe me back my dream!\n\n---\n\n¹ **Big pig trotters (大豬蹄子)**: A Chinese slang term used to describe men who are insensitive, fickle, or chauvinistic.",

    "content": "Zheng Qiang felt like he had been dreaming for a long time. In his dream, he seemed to have returned to the past, to his wild and unrestrained youth.\n\nIn his previous life, he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. His father initially ran a pig farm, but later seized an opportunity and rode the wave of soaring housing prices in the country.\n\nHe poured all his family's assets into it and borrowed a lot of money from fellow villagers, becoming one of the first groups of real estate speculators. After that, there was no stopping him.\n\nZheng Qiang remembered that when he was little, he used to run around by the pigsty at home and liked to talk to the little pigs. He didn't mind their smell; he was used to it.\n\nBut by the time Zheng Qiang started primary school, his family no longer raised pigs.\n\nIn his father's words, speculating on houses was the most profitable business. Only idiots would laboriously raise pigs.\n\nZheng Qiang wasn't a model student. He was just an ordinary person. Since his family was wealthy, he had plenty of pocket money. He started socializing in society before graduating from junior high.\n\nWhile his peers were secretly watching adult films in dorms to learn theoretical knowledge on their MP4 players, he was already getting hands-on experience.\n\nLater, when he got tired of women, he started playing with men. After that, he naturally started using drugs.\n\nHe would gather a bunch of disreputable friends, throw parties with beautiful women, fine wine, alcohol lamps, and flasks. Life was like a dream, living in a dream – how wonderful.\n\nHowever, Zheng Qiang didn't die from an overdose of the substance;\n\nHeaven gave him a chance. Once, after a wild party, he stumbled out alone, wandering the streets, listening to music on his phone and gyrating to the rhythm, venting the residual effects of the drugs.\n\nUnexpectedly, late at night on the street, he encountered a robbery and assault.\n\nZheng Qiang had had his fair share of experience with men and women, but that was always consensual, or he would buy their consent with money.\n\nTherefore, seeing these uncooperative individuals, with the drugs still in his system, Zheng Qiang impulsively decided to play the hero.\n\nThen,\n\nHe was stabbed,\n\nThen,\n\nHe died.\n\nAfter all, asking someone whose body had long been depleted by alcohol and sex, and who was still indulging in destructive drug use, to perform a heroic rescue act was asking a bit too much of the screenwriter.\n\nClutching his wound,\n\nHe collapsed,\n\nAs he watched the woman he had saved abandon him, not even calling an ambulance, and run away with \"deng deng deng\" footsteps,\n\nZheng Qiang didn't feel angry or that it was a waste.\n\nHe just felt that dying like this...\n\nIt wasn't so bad.\n\nThe events of his previous life began to surface relentlessly. Scenes from his past life crisscrossed in his mind.\n\nEven the moment of his final demise\n\nWas replayed many times.\n\nJust when Zheng Qiang felt like he was about to vomit from remembering too much,\n\nThank God,\n\nHe finally woke up.\n\nOpening his eyes,\n\nHe saw himself lying in a hospital bed, the surrounding color scheme predominantly white.\n\nHe let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nHe hadn't died a second time.\n\nThere were no such hospital rooms in hell.\n\nHis head was still a bit groggy, and his body was itchy.\n\nHe tried to turn over but immediately fell off the bed.\n\nWith some difficulty, he managed to prop himself up against the wall. Zheng Qiang pursed his lips. He was very thirsty and wanted water. Although he had an IV drip, it wasn't enough. He needed to drink water. His daily water intake was more than three times that of an average adult male.\n\nBecause the barbs that appeared during his combat activities were usually hidden within his body like small fleshy buds, and these things required more water for them to absorb.\n\nHe pushed open the hospital room door and walked out, leaning against the wall. He needed to find water to drink; he was so thirsty.\n\nThen,\n\nZheng Qiang passed by the kitchen.\n\nThe layout of the pharmacy was as follows: the storefront was at the front. The area behind was divided into two hospital rooms and an operating room on the left side, and a bathroom and kitchen on the right side. The rooms for the pharmacy staff were upstairs.\n\n\"Dong dong dong!\"\n\n\"Dong dong dong!\"\n\n\"Dong dong dong!\"\n\nViolent pounding sounds could be heard.\n\nZheng Qiang turned his head and looked inside.\n\nHe,\n\nSaw a mountain,\n\nA majestic mountain,\n\nA very large... mountain of flesh.\n\nNurse Fangfang was chopping ribs with a cleaver.\n\nThe flying bone fragments and meat made the Zheng Qiang behind her instinctively swallow.\n\nHe didn't dare to call out to this \"little nurse.\"\n\nInstead, he stumbled his way to the front, to the already closed pharmacy area, and got water from the dispenser to drink.\n\nHe,\n\nDrank half a barrel of water in one go,\n\nOnly then was he satisfied.\n\nLeaning behind the pharmacy counter, he tried to collect his thoughts. He seemed to remember that it was a ghost messenger from Tongcheng who had saved him, and that his ghost messenger badge was on him.\n\nInstinctively, he wanted to leave.\n\nThe pharmacy door was locked.\n\nA slender sharp spike grew from the palm of Zheng Qiang's hand.\n\nHe fiddled with it a few times, and the security lock was opened.\n\nHe pushed the door open a crack,\n\nAnd Zheng Qiang sneaked out.\n\nFresh air,\n\nFree air.\n\nOnce he returned to Huaian,\n\nHe would be a hero again.\n\nOn someone else's territory, even breathing felt so restricted.\n\nEspecially when facing that dangerous situation, and Zhou Ze actually survived and even rescued them, it meant that Zhou Ze had other ulterior motives.\n\nAt worst, when he returned to Huaian, he would mail Zhou Ze some Huaian braised pig trotters as a thank-you gift.\n\nHe hadn't walked more than a few steps when it wasn't yet dawn, but a car was parked by the roadside. As he passed, Zheng Qiang saw two people sitting in the car.\n\nIn the back was a woman.\n\nHe clearly saw the woman's appearance; it was Yueya.\n\nThe man sitting in the driver's seat was someone he didn't recognize.\n\nInstinctively, he sensed a sense of danger and turned to leave.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe car door was opened,\n\nAnd then slammed shut heavily.\n\nLawyer An, wearing a flashy little red suit, was wearing sunglasses late at night,\n\nWith a cigarette dangling from his fingers,\n\nHe leaned against the car,\n\nTapping lightly on the car roof with his fingers.\n\nZheng Qiang stopped.\n\n\"Leaving already?\"\n\nLawyer An asked.\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nZheng Qiang replied.\n\nLawyer An nodded, \"Do you want me to give you a ride back?\"\n\n\"No, I'll take the train back.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nLawyer An chuckled, then tossed the cigarette butt he was holding.\n\nSometimes, Lawyer An felt quite helpless. Boss Zhou was too lazy and his methods too lax. Although this guy had caused quite a stir and brought back many good things,\n\nOften,\n\nHe had to help him look after things and clean up the mess.\n\nThe boss himself had brought back two seriously injured youngsters last night. After their surgeries and rescue, he went back to sleep with his maids.\n\nThese weren't two piglets brought home,\n\nThey could run away on their own.\n\n\"Come back, sit in the car. Be good.\"\n\nLawyer An waved to Zheng Qiang.\n\nZheng Qiang turned his head and looked at Lawyer An, smiling, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"You talk too much.\"\n\nLawyer An threw the cigarette butt on the ground.\n\n\"Hurry up and sit back down.\"\n\n\"What if I say no?\"\n\nHearing this,\n\nLawyer An smiled,\n\nHe stepped on the cigarette butt with the sole of his leather shoe,\n\nAnd then walked towards Zheng Qiang with great excitement.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nHe was quite happy?\n\nFive minutes later,\n\nZheng Qiang, already injured, now with added injuries, and his entire face swollen into a pig's head, was forcibly stuffed into the back seat of the car, leaning against Yueya.\n\nLawyer An, like a neglected woman in a long drought who had finally found release, sat back in the driver's seat, turned on the car stereo, and started playing music.\n\nZheng Qiang's nostrils were still bleeding, but Lawyer An, worried about dirtying his car, stuffed two pieces of cotton into them beforehand.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZheng Qiang looked up at Yueya beside him in surprise.\n\nShe looked very weak as well,\n\nBut uninjured.\n\n\"Why...\"\n\nZheng Qiang asked.\n\nTwo of his front teeth were broken, so his speech was a bit slurred.\n\n\"I woke up before you. I also wanted to leave. After going back, I planned to mail him some famous Suzhou cloud slices as a gift,\"\n\nYueya said, glancing at Lawyer An in front of her, and continued:\n\n\"Then he told me to get in the car and sit.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then I got in the car and sat.\"\n\n\"......\" Zheng Qiang.\n\nYueya pouted. Honestly speaking, Zheng Qiang was beaten quite pitifully. When Lawyer An had told her to get in the car and sit earlier, she had instinctively sensed that he seemed to want her to refuse.\n\nBut she still agreed obediently,\n\nAnd then she saw that he was very disappointed with her compliance.\n\nYueya couldn't understand where this strange emotion came from.\n\nActually,\n\nThe reason was very simple.\n\nThe boss was sleeping soundly upstairs with two beauties, one big and one small,\n\nWhile he himself was on guard duty here.\n\nHow could he have a good temper?\n\nAt this moment, he wished someone would come and beat him up.\n\nAfter beating someone up,\n\nHe felt much better.\n\n\"You don't kill us, nor do you let us go. What are you planning to do?\" Yueya asked. Then, she seemed to have thought of something, \"Are you planning to forcibly take us in?\"\n\n\"You're actually right. Fate brought us together. You should just accept it.\"\n\nIn reality, for excellent ghost messengers who reached a certain level of strength and accumulated enough merit points to become captains, they had to find five other ghost messengers to recognize them and become their subordinates.\n\nThis mode was somewhat like characters in anime capturing Pokémon,\n\nBulbasaur Ghost Messenger,\n\nYou are captured by me!\n\nAs for captains like Gu He, who still needed to rally troops and call other ghost messengers for help, it meant from another perspective that he was not doing very well. His original subordinates had either fallen apart or died.\n\n\"Are you helping him?\" Yueya narrowed her eyes.\n\nAlthough Zheng Qiang was injured, crushing him directly and beating him up again was not an easy task.\n\nLawyer An nodded.\n\n\"I'm very curious why you're helping him, and I'm even more curious why I have to have my head held down and recognize him as my captain.\"\n\nLawyer An turned off the car stereo.\n\nThe car fell silent.\n\nHe let out a long sigh and smiled.\n\n\"I'm too lazy to say threats. I know you don't want to hear this stuff. Just imagine it yourselves. Consider it as me saying five hours of villain threat dialogue from a TV series.\"\n\nThen,\n\nLawyer An paused,\n\nAnd added:\n\n\"The wind is picking up. We need to stick together so we don't get blown away.\"",

    "content": "Lawyer An felt like a head eunuch. When the Emperor slept with his concubines, he had to stand by with a tablet, recording the year, month, and day.\n\n\"Did she conceive?\"\n\nWhen a concubine became pregnant, he would take it out for comparison, to confirm if it was indeed the imperial seed.\n\nHe sat in the car for four to five hours.\n\nOnly after the old Taoist priest woke up and opened the bookstore did Lawyer An, with a grim expression, escort Yueya and Zheng Qiang into the study.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't want to rest. Although meditation wasn't as comfortable as sleeping, it was still a form of rest. However, these two babies still needed someone to watch them.\n\nLooking around the entire bookstore, even though these two ghost messengers were already injured, there were only two and a half people capable and qualified to watch them.\n\nOne was himself.\n\nThe other was Zhou Ze.\n\nThe half was the little loli.\n\nThe reason the little loli was considered half was that if she was left to watch them alone, there was a risk of errors.\n\nThe problem was, you couldn't mistreat them or deliberately cripple them.\n\nOf course,\n\nLawyer An considered his thrashing of Zheng Qiang last night to be an act of loving care.\n\nLawyer An intended to take these two in as Zhou Ze's subordinates. For Zhou Ze to advance to be a Constabulary Captain, he needed at least five subordinates. Currently, he was short by three.\n\nThe little loli was one, there was one in Changzhou, and Zhang Yanfeng, who was visiting relatives, was another. With these two, he would have enough.\n\nLawyer An believed that Zhou Ze bringing them back also implied this intention.\n\nSince they would all be his own people and work together in the future, you couldn't deliberately torture them or cripple them, otherwise, working together later would be awkward.\n\nLawyer An made himself a cup of coffee, specifically stealing Zhou Ze's favorite civet coffee from the back room.\n\nThe boss was sleeping comfortably, and he had been a jailer all night. He deserved some compensation.\n\nWith that thought,\n\nHe added more than ten spoonfuls.\n\nAs a result,\n\nWhen Lawyer An walked out after making his coffee, he was holding a large thermos that was comparable in volume to a water bottle.\n\nZheng Qiang, with a face swollen like a pig's head, was sitting there, lost in thought.\n\nYueya, on the other hand, seemed to take it all in stride, casually flipping through a magazine.\n\nThe old Taoist priest didn't ask for details, but since they were brought back by Zhou Ze last night and were being watched by Lawyer An today, they were definitely useful people.\n\nHe solicitously served them tea.\n\nOf course,\n\nThe old Taoist priest didn't forget to bring the payment QR code from the counter.\n\nYueya and Zheng Qiang were both bewildered,\n\nBut they still took out their phones and scanned the code to pay.\n\nA while later, Zhou Ze came down. Boss Zhou glanced at everyone sitting in the hall, nodded, and didn't rush over. As per usual, after waking up, he took a shower first.\n\nAfter changing into dry clothes, Zhou Ze walked over and sat in his usual spot where he could catch the sun.\n\nBai Yingying brought him the freshly ironed newspaper and orange juice.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the orange juice and asked somewhat confusedly:\n\n\"Where's the coffee?\"\n\nBai Yingying pouted and said:\n\n\"I don't know why, but the coffee can is empty.\"\n\nBoss Zhou's eyes immediately widened.\n\nEven,\n\nBloodshot veins began to slowly spread.\n\nHis entire demeanor leaked out.\n\nIt was estimated that the one sealed within his body was also startled,\n\n\"Encountered a great enemy again?\"\n\n\"Otherwise, where did this almost uncontrollable anger come from?\"\n\nLawyer An opened his thermos.\n\nA rich aroma of coffee immediately filled the air.\n\nHe took a big gulp,\n\nLike an old farmer working in the fields drinking his own thermos of cold water,\n\nSo carefree,\n\nSo content.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Lawyer An,\n\nHis knuckles began to crack.\n\nZheng Qiang and Yueya were sitting a little ahead of Zhou Ze. They, who had been pretending to be calm, suddenly sensed the killing intent from behind them and were stunned.\n\n\"Could it be,\"\n\n\"That this ghost messenger from Tongcheng has changed his mind?\"\n\n\"He wants to kill?\"\n\nFor a moment,\n\nAnxiety appeared in both their eyes. Originally, they had a bit of self-regard. Even though they were about to be forced to sign contracts,\n\nThey still wanted to hold their heads high and maintain their dignity.\n\nBut now, they were truly afraid that Zhou Ze would change his mind and not want them anymore.\n\nThe two of them stood up together,\n\nPreparing to promote themselves,\n\nTo show that they would be very capable subordinates (or sub-ordinates).\n\nBut at that moment, Zhou Ze gritted his teeth and said, \"An Buqi!\"\n\nYueya and Zheng Qiang looked at each other.\n\nThis anger,\n\nWasn't directed at them?\n\nThe two obediently sat back down,\n\nLike two frightened quails.\n\nLawyer An twisted open the lid again and took several big gulps of coffee, as if he hadn't noticed Zhou Ze's anger at all.\n\nBoss Zhou nodded.\n\n\"Poor people,\"\n\n\"Also care about their dignity.\"\n\n\"The poorer they are,\"\n\n\"The more they care about their dignity!\"\n\nBoss Zhou forced a smile and asked:\n\n\"Does the coffee taste good?\"\n\n\"Hmm, the coffee, it's passable.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang's Nissan car returned, and Zhang Yanfeng got out.\n\nOld Zhang was back from his family visit.\n\nUpon entering, Old Zhang said joyfully:\n\n\"My application was approved. I'll be transferred to Tongcheng to be the captain of the criminal investigation team. Isn't that a coincidence? It fills the vacancy I left before.\"\n\nHe sacrificed himself, and then he filled his own vacancy.\n\nBoss Zhou suddenly envied this fellow Zhang.\n\n\"Do good people,\"\n\n\"Really get such good luck?\"\n\n\"I'm thirsty.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nOld Zhang took the large thermos from Lawyer An and drank it down like a thirsty man.\n\nAfter a burp,\n\nHe wiped his mouth with the back of his hand with some dissatisfaction:\n\n\"Why is it coffee? I thought it was purified water. Drinks don't quench thirst.\"\n\nOld Zhang didn't notice,\n\nThe Boss Zhou sitting opposite him,\n\nHis mouth twitched subconsciously again.\n\n\"I still have a week of vacation. After a week, I'll be back to work.\"\n\nOld Zhang was as happy as a child.\n\nIndeed, it was worth being happy about.\n\nHe had returned from the dead,\n\nStill a criminal investigator,\n\nHe could return to his original post and continue being a police officer, which was great.\n\nHe had a child who would graduate from the police academy independently next year. His parents were deceased, his sister was deceased, and he himself had been divorced for many years. He was almost a lonely person.\n\nThis was equivalent to being reborn ten years younger. Nothing else had changed.\n\n\"Since you're back, let's get everything done together, Old Taoist.\" Lawyer An called out to the old Taoist priest.\n\n\"I'm here, what's up?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\n\"Go to the Tongcheng Grand Hotel and book a banquet to have it delivered. No, forget it, let's go there for lunch directly. You go book a private room, order the dishes, and also go buy some fireworks.\n\nDon't order too many dishes, order less seafood, and if there's wild game or forbidden items, remember to order less as well. A table of dishes should not exceed fifty thousand yuan.\"\n\nZhou Ze, who was at the side, trembled violently.\n\n\"Order a little less,\"\n\n\"Not exceeding fifty thousand?\"\n\nHaving lived two lives,\n\nZhou Ze felt that poverty limited his thinking.\n\n\"As for fireworks, don't buy too many either, just three truckloads should be enough. I don't think Tongcheng prohibits fireworks, but we should still be low-key. Setting off too many would disturb the public.\"\n\n\"Don't buy too many,\"\n\n\"Three truckloads should be enough?\"\n\nBoss Zhou's hand holding the newspaper trembled slightly.\n\n\"Will this be on the company account?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\n\"Yes, on the company account.\"\n\nBoss Zhou couldn't sit still. He felt that if he didn't get up and say a few words, today would probably cost over two hundred thousand.\n\n\"Don't make it so troublesome, let's keep it simple,\" Zhou Ze said nonchalantly.\n\n\"Keeping it simple,\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\"\n\n\"Is synonymous with 'I'm poor'.\"\n\n\"If it was just one person becoming your subordinate, then it could be kept simple. But now it's all of them becoming your subordinates together. This is like ancient master-disciple relationships, it needs to be grand.\n\nOnce you become a subordinate, for a long time afterward, you will truly share joys and sorrows together, prosper and suffer together. Isn't it worth being solemn?\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What you said makes so much sense, let me think about how to refute it...\"\n\nZheng Qiang and Yueya didn't say anything more. They knew that they had survived the university yesterday, and that the man named An had not killed them last night precisely because he wanted them to pledge allegiance.\n\nThe knife and the cutting board were in their hands, they were the fish and the meat.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThey were not qualified to object.\n\nThey just had to accept their fate obediently.\n\nAt this time, the little loli also came down after washing up. Seeing the group below, she sighed with emotion:\n\n\"Oh, it's really lively today.\"\n\nLawyer An beckoned to the little loli and said:\n\n\"You've come at the right time. You're the first ghost messenger Boss took in, so you're like an older sister. Today is the welcoming banquet for your younger siblings, and you must attend.\"\n\nThe little loli was a little surprised: \"So I'm the older one, and they're the younger ones?\"\n\nImmediately after,\n\nThe little loli seemed to realize something and quickly spat, \"Damn it, this big pig's trotters took advantage of me for nothing.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest couldn't help but want to laugh.\n\nThey slept in the same bed every day,\n\nWhat advantage hadn't been taken?\n\nThe little loli coughed a few times and asked, \"You're taking in five? Such a big event.\"\n\nUpon hearing this,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly frowned: \"Didn't you say that to become a Constabulary Captain, you had to take in five ghost messengers?\"\n\n\"Must? Who told you that?\" the little loli asked confusedly.\n\n\"You.\"\n\n\"Me?\" The little loli pointed to herself, finding it amusing, \"You must be misremembering. I remember telling you that taking in three was enough, a minimum of three.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Lawyer An.\n\nLawyer An was also surprised,\n\nHe thought to himself: Didn't you bring these two back last night and prepare to take in subordinates?\n\nBut Lawyer An still replied: \"To become a Constabulary Captain, you need to take in at least three, and at most five. Five is the perfect number, because after you're promoted to Constabulary Captain, if your subordinates each earn ten merit points, you can get three points, but they can't get yours. Of course, the more the better.\n\nAnd this must be completed before you are officially promoted to Constabulary Captain. Once you become a Constabulary Captain, you can no longer take in subordinates. Some Constabulary Captains who only took in three will truly become lonely commanders if a few of their subordinates die later.\n\nI've arranged and planned for you according to the highest standard of equipment. You understand, a high-quality start is very important...\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, interrupting Lawyer An, and asked:\n\n\"I remember you just said that if it was just one subordinate, it could be kept simple, right?\"\n\nHearing this,\n\nYueya and Zheng Qiang, who were standing by,\n\nFelt a sudden chill on their necks.",

    "content": "Even though Zheng Qiang and Yue Ya showed great will to survive,\n\noffering to pay on his behalf,\n\nthis was a modern-day version of being sold and then helping to count the money.\n\nBut in the end, it was Zhou Ze who truly paid. He was reluctant and felt the pinch, but the money that needed to be spent still had to be spent; Boss Zhou understood this much.\n\nBoss Zhou was frugal,\n\nbut not to the point of being stingy for money.\n\nThis point surprised Lawyer An a little.\n\nThe meal wasn't particularly lively, and the atmosphere wasn't great.\n\nIt wasn't because everyone still had unresolved issues and couldn't relax at the dinner table,\n\nbut because out of everyone at the table, only Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang could truly eat their fill.\n\nMm,\n\nyou could also say that of everyone sitting around the table, only these two were alive.\n\nThe Death Guard liked to eat insects and wasn't very interested in the dishes on the table. When he was at the bookstore, he also didn't eat at the table. Bai Yingying didn't need to eat food to survive, so she only tasted a little.\n\nThat is to say,\n\nat the dinner table,\n\nmost people were suffering from severe anorexia.\n\nFurthermore, Zhou Ze and the little loli were reluctant to use the Lycoris radiata oral liquid and didn't want to expose or share it, so everyone just looked at each other, struggling with the food in front of them.\n\nDespite the expensive meal,\n\neveryone in the private room ate with an atmosphere of \"remembering the hardships and appreciating the sweetness.\"\n\nWho knew the food on the plate, every grain was hard-earned.\n\nIndeed, it was hard work to swallow each grain of rice,\n\nas if it were more arduous than a farmer's work in the fields.\n\nAfter the meal,\n\nZhang Yanfeng, Yue Ya, and Zheng Qiang all offered their soul blood to Zhou Ze, which was then integrated into Zhou Ze's Ghost Messenger certificate. Boss Zhou was now a boss in the truest sense.\n\nWith five ghost messenger subordinates in hand, he truly felt as if he commanded a vast army, and in the future, he could even play the trick of sending a single arrow into the sky when facing any situation.\n\nAfter these matters were concluded,\n\nZhou Ze and Lawyer An chose to walk back.\n\nZheng Qiang and Yue Ya returned to Wuxi and Huaian respectively.\n\nAfter all, it wasn't convenient for everyone to stay together in Tongcheng. Tongcheng was such a small place, and crowding together meant that not everyone could eat their fill.\n\nThe others from the bookstore had already taken a car back.\n\nIt was a cloudy day, so even walking on the street in the afternoon wasn't too hot.\n\n\"Next, it's about the merit points. But this isn't a big problem. At least, for your current stage, there are ways for you to gain merit points.\"\n\n\"Gain?\"\n\nThe word \"gain\" implied simplicity and efficiency, saving a lot of time and effort.\n\nLawyer An nodded. \"When I was chatting with Old Daoist, I learned that you went to a village and collected all the people there.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nIt was Sanxiang Village.\n\nEven now,\n\nZhou Ze was still somewhat unsettled by the events in Sanxiang Village. He had initially thought it was a village overrun by hungry ghosts, but it turned out there was such a tragic hidden reason behind it.\n\nIt was also because of that incident that Zhou Ze gained a deeper understanding of the relationship between \"humans\" and \"ghosts.\"\n\n\"Actually, there are quite a few places like that all over the country. Think about it, collecting the souls of an entire village at once would definitely lead to a significant increase in merit points.\n\nOf course, not all of them are as positive as that village.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, indicating that he understood.\n\n\"It's getting windy, and we need to hurry. Last night, I chatted with Zheng Qiang and Yue Ya in the car, and they said that the constable named Gu He had planned to send that ghost directly to Shanghai.\n\nBut for some reason, he changed course.\"\n\n\"What kind of ghost was that?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe clown wearing a mask could provoke the original sin within a person. This method was indeed much more sophisticated than those spirits who only used illusions to scare you.\n\n\"It's a type of creature from hell that likes to wander in the misty depths of hell. I remember that the lords of hell liked to catch some when they had nothing to do and keep them around.\n\nThe Ten Courts of Hell have quite a few, but they are used for punishment, to provoke a person's original evil and turn it into flames to devour that person's soul.\n\nHowever, that's a relatively advanced form of torture and is usually used against great villains. Ordinary wandering souls don't get to enjoy this level of service.\n\nSome of the big figures in hell also like to keep them to absorb these evil thoughts and original sins, and then eat them themselves.\n\nAfter all, for beings at their level, these things not only won't bring trouble but can also be used to temper themselves and be used for their own benefit.\"\n\n\"Then how did this thing get out?\"\n\n\"I don't know the specific reason, just as I don't know how you and the little loli have Lycoris radiata juice.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze was stunned.\n\nFortunately,\n\nLawyer An didn't ask him for it.\n\n\"I've been involved in the underground bureaucracy and also in the underworld for many years. Because I've been involved in both, I'm very sensitive to some changes.\n\nThe wind is getting stronger, and the structure is likely to be blown apart in the next two years. Some rules that were ironclad ten or twenty years ago,\n\nbut now are just self-deceiving decorations. It's like the Monkey King in 'Journey to the West,' who had to cause havoc in the Underworld to bring someone back to life.\n\nAnd now, you can even bring people back to life and become a ghost messenger.\n\nThe times are changing, and the hearts of ghosts are no longer as they were.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out two cigarettes, offered one to Lawyer An, and held one in his mouth.\n\nLawyer An looked worried. Zhou Ze believed that he wasn't worried about the future development of hell. If he truly cared so much about the country and its people, he wouldn't be doing illegal things while also worrying.\n\nHe was worried about his own future safety, and his reason for defecting to him and planning meticulously for him was also a calculation for self-preservation in the future.\n\n\"I heard a patrol inspector with a long lifespan say that in his time, when being a ghost messenger, the rules were very strict, with many regulations. It was far from the lax and free atmosphere of today.\n\nWhen a group's foundation begins to decay, it means that major changes are imminent.\"\n\nLawyer An looked at Zhou Ze and said seriously, \"Therefore, to protect yourself, you must elevate your position before this great ship completely sinks.\"\n\n\"In the end, won't we all sink together?\"\n\n\"Are you stupid? When it really sinks, the leaders will be the first ones to get on the limited lifeboats.\"\n\n\"What you're saying... makes a lot of sense.\"\n\nAs they walked, they passed a park, and Zhou Ze went in to use the restroom first.\n\nLawyer An waited outside.\n\nAs soon as he entered the restroom,\n\nZhou Ze saw someone with dark red hair wearing a skirt in front of him.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively took a few steps back, rechecked the sign on the restroom door, and saw it was for men, then glanced at the urinals inside before re-entering with peace of mind.\n\nThe person urinated next to Zhou Ze,\n\ntook out his manhood,\n\nand stood with Zhou Ze.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze came out, he waited for a while but couldn't see Lawyer An.\n\nWhen he called, Lawyer An said he was inside the park.\n\nZhou Ze walked further in, looking around.\n\nHe found many women standing among the trees. In fact, these women were all of a certain age, mostly the type Old Daoist liked,\n\nand some even exceeded the type Old Daoist liked.\n\nThey stood there, soliciting business. There weren't many young men coming here; most of the clients were elderly, and the prices were very affordable, even cheaper than fast food.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze found Lawyer An, he saw him hugging a slightly younger woman by the flowerbed, with her sitting on his lap.\n\nHe looked quite pleased.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and asked, \"Interesting?\"\n\nHow was it that they were just discussing serious matters, and after a single trip to the restroom, the mood seemed to have changed so quickly?\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze knew that Lawyer An was the type who enjoyed all sorts of pleasures. He still had the silver card that Lawyer An had given him in his wallet.\n\nHe had forgotten to throw it away, yes, he had forgotten.\n\n\"After eating delicacies, it's good for your health to occasionally eat some wild vegetables.\n\nMen, like growing bodies, shouldn't be picky eaters. Constantly eating refined food is also not good for your digestion.\"\n\nLawyer An said to Zhou Ze with the air of an experienced person,\n\n\"By the way, you should find one too, otherwise, wouldn't it be awkward? It's not expensive.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. As he sat next to Lawyer An, many elderly women approached him, asking if he wanted services, but Zhou Ze refused them all.\n\nHe slept with Yingying every day,\n\nand his main wife was a sophisticated, cold, and beautiful woman in uniform.\n\nWhen the flowers at home were much more beautiful than the wild flowers, the wild flowers held no attraction.\n\nLawyer An, on the other hand, was having a very comfortable time, constantly touching and caressing, and he seemed even more excited because Zhou Ze was sitting next to him.\n\nOf course, just rubbing like this wouldn't lead to a home run; it was only afternoon, and it would be more convenient to have a home run later in the evening.\n\nIf one didn't have enough self-control, they could just rub until something happened.\n\n\"You're uncomfortable watching, aren't you?\" Lawyer An turned his head to look at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Don't you feel uncomfortable?\" Lawyer An looked at Zhou Ze's crotch.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Alright, you don't like the ones here. I'll take you to a good place later, there are many beautiful girls there.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"What, you're still not willing to go?\"\n\n\"I'm uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Then let's go.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling well.\"\n\n\"Then you definitely have to go.\"\n\n\"Touch the woman on you carefully,\" Zhou Ze suddenly said.\n\n\"Touch what?\"\n\n\"See if she's lubricated.\"\n\n\"That's a given, my technique and skill are no joke, hahaha.\"\n\nLawyer An said, and with full confidence, he watched Zhou Ze reach his hand under the woman on him.\n\nThen,\n\nLawyer An's entire expression froze.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nLawyer An screamed.\n\nThe woman on him also got up scared.\n\n\"Get out!\" Lawyer An shouted.\n\nHe felt very uncomfortable now,\n\nand also very unwell.\n\nHe finally understood Zhou Ze's feelings.\n\n\"Get out of what? Hurry up and pay! Is it easy for me to make money by cross-dressing!!!\"",

    "title": "Chapter 378: The Case Appears",
    "content": "A week has passed since the last ghost-capturing operation, and everything at the bookstore has gone on as usual, quite uneventfully.\n\nHowever, despite the peace, there haven't been zero changes.\n\nLawyer An introduced Bai Yingying to a taekwondo gym to learn fighting techniques. She only attends from 2 PM to 5 PM, spending the rest of her time at the bookstore accompanying Zhou Ze.\n\nAccording to Lawyer An, the female zombie, despite her strength and terrifying physique, doesn't quite grasp the art of combat, something that naturally needs to be learned.\n\nThe little loli once asked Bai Yingying if she'd encountered any \"big pig trotters\" who actively approached her after she started going out.\n\nAfter all, even though the little loli called her a \"stupid zombie,\" it was undeniable that Yingying possessed the appearance of a well-developed, high school beauty. While she stayed at the bookstore, it didn't matter much, but once she went out, she would undoubtedly attract a lot of attention.\n\nThen, Yingying would return daily and chat with the little loli about how many \"big pig trotters\" she had broken the legs of that day.\n\nIndeed, with Yingying's temper, she would only \"whimper\" for Zhou Ze.\n\nOther men were all stinky.\n\nHer temper wasn't as gentle and beautiful as she appeared at the bookstore.\n\nOne must remember that when she first awakened, Xu Qinglang was almost killed by Bai Yingying.\n\nSpeaking of Old Xu, he still locks himself in his room all day, drawing talismans. Except for meal times when he comes out to cook, he basically doesn't leave his room.\n\nHe has things he can cultivate.\n\nBut because he now owns over twenty properties,\n\nAnd was engrossed in the time spent pursuing his entrepreneurial dream as a chef,\n\nHe had unknowingly neglected many things.\n\nAfter his master, who \"loved him dearly,\" appeared,\n\nIt spurred Old Xu to pick up his old pursuits again.\n\nThe same applied to the zombie. After Lawyer An made him finish *Naruto*, he was told to continue with *One Piece*, causing the zombie to babble incoherently, alternating between \"Hello\" and \"Idiot.\"\n\nAs for the old Taoist priest,\n\nLawyer An couldn't be bothered. The man is already seventy-one; no need to stir up trouble.\n\nHowever, the old Taoist priest's monkey,\n\nIs often brought out by Lawyer An to play with. At the same time, Lawyer An also prepares some medicinal baths for the monkey.\n\nInitially, the old Taoist priest was a little worried.\n\nBut upon seeing the monkey's fur becoming increasingly glossy and its spirit improving, he was relieved.\n\nSince there have been changes,\n\nThere have naturally also been no changes.\n\nThe only one who hasn't changed,\n\nIs Boss Zhou.\n\nZhou Ze still goes to bed at one and wakes up at one. In the morning, he lies there basking in the sun and drinking... orange juice.\n\nLawyer An is helpless about this. However, in recent times, with the steady capture of souls, coupled with previous accumulations, Zhou Ze's performance points have reached eight hundred. Two hundred more, and he can officially be promoted to Constable.\n\nDuring this period, when Lawyer An had nothing to do, he was busy researching local chronicles and maps.\n\nHe had previously promised to help Zhou Ze rack up points,\n\nBut this was like playing an online game and clearing dungeons; one needed to prepare a strategy first.\n\nIn short, ever since Lawyer An joined the bookstore, it finally had someone capable of doing things, and it could be considered a temporary escape from the \"lazy salted fish\" atmosphere that Boss Zhou's example had set.\n\n...\n\nThis morning, as Zhou Ze was reading the newspaper, he saw Zhang Yanfeng, dressed in his police uniform, coming down the stairs. He even stood seriously in front of the mirror, tidying up his appearance.\n\n\"Going to work?\" Zhou Ze asked, putting down the newspaper.\n\nOld Zhang smiled and nodded. \"The holiday is over. Today is my official return to duty.\"\n\n\"Since you've gotten younger again, you should hurry and find yourself a companion. It seems police officers tend to marry late. You're in your early thirties, so there's still a chance.\"\n\n\"Scram, stop being indecent.\" Zhang Yanfeng shot Zhou Ze a glare.\n\n\"I saw everyone on Zhang Feng's Moments posting about their girlfriends; did you see it?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded.\n\n\"That's great. It shows he's overcome his grief over his father's passing and is starting a new life. So, you can also consider a second spring for this old tree.\"\n\n\"On my first day back at work, why are you talking to me as if I'm on *If You Are the One*?\"\n\n\"You're too kind.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng drove off in Xu Qinglang's car.\n\nTwo cars were always parked in the parking area outside the bookstore: one was Old Xu's car, and the other was Lawyer An's car. Whoever needed a car to go out would go to the counter to get the key.\n\nBut considering his profession, Lawyer An's car was a bit too high-end, so Old Zhang chose to take Old Xu's car.\n\nZhou Ze stretched.\n\nYawned.\n\nHe felt his life was becoming a bit too decadent.\n\nSin, sin.\n\nThen he changed his posture and continued lying down,\n\nReading the newspaper.\n\nIn less than an hour,\n\nA car drove back outside the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look and was stunned for a moment because Old Zhang had actually returned by car!\n\nDid something happen?\n\nWas his first day back at work not smooth?\n\nAs Old Zhang rushed in,\n\nBefore Zhou Ze could even ask,\n\nOld Zhang eagerly sat down in front of Zhou Ze,\n\nTook out a case file,\n\nPushed it towards Zhou Ze,\n\nAnd said anxiously:\n\n\"This case file, take a look quickly.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou felt something was amiss.\n\nHe immediately asked:\n\n\"Hey, you've only been back at work for less than an hour, and there's already a case?\"\n\nThat doesn't sound right either.\n\nThe case file for a newly reported case is already ready?\n\n\"No, I came back right after reporting for duty,\" Zhang Yanfeng replied. \"For this, I even refused the welcome lunch the bureau prepared for me.\"\n\nAs for Zhang Yanfeng, he knew everyone at the bureau well; there was no need to reacquaint himself.\n\n\"Then what do you mean by this?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Investigating the case,\" Zhang Yanfeng said matter-of-factly.\n\n\"What does that have to do with me?\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand dismissively, leaning back.\n\nIn his past life, Zhang Yanfeng always wanted him to help with cases, and even helped him secure the identity of a police consultant. This was because, for many cases, \"spiritual communication\" made problem-solving much easier.\n\nHowever, a police consultant only received a medal, no salary. At most, during holidays, they would receive a salted duck to take home.\n\nBoss Zhou had no aspirations of being a public servant in the true sense.\n\n\"How is it unrelated to you? I'm your subordinate now, right?\"\n\n\"I can't bear it.\"\n\nZhou Ze quickly refused.\n\n\"My business is your business, right?\"\n\n\"You flatter me.\"\n\n\"This case is a cold case left from sixteen years ago. I had just joined the police force back then, and this case left a deep impression on me. It was never solved, and it's always been a knot in my heart.\n\nBefore, I knew it was asking too much to trouble you with cases.\n\nBut now,\n\nMy status is the same as yours,\n\nAnd I'm back at work, so helping me is helping yourself, right?\n\nAt the very least,\n\nI won't feel any psychological burden asking you to help with cases anymore, as we're all family now.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and finally understood. He pointed at Zhang Yanfeng and said, \"You've been planning this all along, haven't you?\"\n\nOn his first day back, returning less than an hour after reporting for duty – if you said it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, how could that be possible!\n\n\"Help me out, please help me out.\" Zhang Yanfeng was still pleading with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, truly sorry.\"\n\nSorry,\n\nI refuse.\n\nAlso,\n\nWho are you?\n\n\"What kind of case is it?\" the old Taoist priest chimed in, coming over to watch the excitement.\n\n\"A dismemberment case.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng replied.\n\n\"Yo, that's pretty scary.\" The old Taoist priest spat out a sunflower seed from his mouth. \"I remember there was a very famous dismemberment case in Nanjing back in the day.\"\n\n\"This is different from the Nanjing case. This case wasn't publicized in Tongcheng back then, and therefore, it didn't cause a social uproar. However, one thing is certain: the body was dismembered by the killer.\"\n\n\"Sigh.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest shook his head.\n\nHe picked up the case file,\n\nTook a look,\n\nThen he searched around,\n\nAnd asked, \"Where's the victim's photo?\"\n\n\"Haven't found it.\" Zhang Yanfeng said with some helplessness.\n\n\"Haven't found it?\"\n\n\"I remember our bureau conducted a very detailed investigation back then. We searched through missing persons reports and nearby residents, but we couldn't identify the victim.\"\n\n\"That exaggerated?\"\n\n\"Sixteen years ago, the investigation conditions and forensic technology weren't as good as they are now. Resident identity registration wasn't as comprehensive either.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nWe only found portions of the victim's muscle tissue deliberately left behind by the killer. We didn't even find the victim's bones. The only thing we could confirm was that the victim was a young woman, because among the items deliberately discarded by the killer, there was a piece of RF.\"\n\nOld Zhang licked his lips and sighed, \"Beast.\"\n\nOld Zhang looked at Zhou Ze again. \"Boss, there are simply too few valuable clues in this case. We really need you to step in and help.\"\n\n\"Are you bored? Are you determined to work on such a cold case?\" Zhou Ze asked with a laugh. \"A cold case where even the victim's identity hasn't been clarified. I say, if I help you this time, will you plan to challenge the Nanjing dismemberment case or the Baiyin serial murder case, or that TA poisoning case next?\"\n\nZhou Ze felt that after returning to work with a new lease on life, Old Zhang had become unrestrained.\n\nPerhaps it was that,\n\nSince I've already died once, what is there to hold back?\n\n\"Boss, the Baiyin case was solved last year,\" the old Taoist priest reminded him softly.\n\nZhou Ze glared at the old Taoist priest.\n\nThe old Taoist priest immediately shut up.\n\n\"According to the investigation and speculation at the time, the killer should have been discarding a piece of human flesh on a specific road every day for many consecutive days. However, the number of body parts collected by the police was very, very small, only these few pieces in the case file photos.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Because the killer used plastic bags of relatively good quality at the time to package the human flesh, and would also wrap them in cardboard boxes. They would be placed by the roadside,\n\nAnd it's estimated that many passersby, thinking it was meat bought from the market and dropped by someone,\n\nWould take it home themselves,\n\nCook it,\n\nAnd eat it.\"",

    "content": "Ate?\n\nHearing this, the old Taoist subconsciously swallowed.\n\nSixteen years ago, living conditions were definitely much worse than now. If anyone on their commute, or elderly people passing by, found this well-packaged meat,\n\nand thought they had gotten a great deal, happily taking it home to cook, it would probably be the most normal reaction.\n\nMoreover, although the taste of human flesh is slightly different from pork, you can't say there's a huge gap. Back then, a serial killer killed someone and sold the human meat as ostrich meat for a long time, almost becoming a local specialty.\n\n\"It wasn't until the meat chunks were found on the RF that the person who picked it up chose to report it to the police.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng lit a cigarette and continued:\n\n\"The police mobilized to conduct interviews and investigations. From that day on, the murderer never threw out meat chunks again. Also, approximately seven or eight households that had picked up meat were discovered. Two of these families' meat had not been eaten yet and were retrieved by us as evidence. The other five families had already eaten it.\n\nI estimate that there might have been more people who found it. Some may have been too embarrassed to admit it and report it, while others might have been part of the transient population nearby that we couldn't investigate.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng exhaled a smoke ring, \"At that time, I had only been working for a few years, and it was the first time I encountered a case with such severe circumstances.\n\nIf it were a simple murder and disposal of a body, most of them would be crimes of passion. But this murderer's act of dismembering and disposing of the body for at least half a month shows a deliberate playful mindset.\n\nIt's a pity that\n\nthe bureau had already done everything they could,\n\nyet they still couldn't even identify the victim.\"\n\nZhou Ze also lit a cigarette and rubbed his temples, saying somewhat helplessly, \"There's nothing I can do about this case by looking for me. Sixteen years have passed. Even if the murdered girl from back then became a vengeful spirit, it's impossible for her to exist for sixteen years without dissipating.\n\nThere are no ghosts to ask. And based on your description, it's more likely a case of a perverted murder, not a supernatural event.\"\n\nWhat ghosts do, Boss Zhou is good at,\n\nbut when it comes to cases committed by humans, asking Boss Zhou to truly impersonate a detective is really asking too much.\n\nZhou Ze still had this much self-awareness.\n\n\"It's all about human effort,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"Some things are difficult to accomplish by human effort.\"\n\n\"That's great, since we're no longer humans, we're ghosts now.\"\n\n\".........\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhang Yanfeng licked his lips, \"The location where the murderer dumped the body parts was on a small road near the Little Stone Bridge. That road has long been renovated. It used to be an asphalt road, and now it's a cement road. Moreover, the surrounding landmarks, including shopping malls and old work units, have also been relocated or changed.\n\nAfter all, the urbanization of Tongcheng has progressed too rapidly over the years.\"\n\n\"Then that's it, this case can't be investigated anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt it was necessary to end the topic. If it were an ordinary case, he would help out for Old Zhang's sake, but this case was simply a cold case among cold cases.\n\nOld Zhang wanted to become a ghost to satisfy his \"sentiments\" from when he first became a police officer,\n\nbut Boss Zhou didn't want to run around for such worthless sentimentality and waste his time.\n\n\"How about I take you to see the place where the body parts were dumped?\" Zhang Yanfeng looked at Zhou Ze with some anticipation. \"Perhaps you'll find something.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to his nose and asked,\n\n\"Who am I?\"\n\n\"Zhou Ze?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\n\"I am just a ghost catcher. I am not an inspector, nor a judge, nor King Yama. I really don't know what else I can find out about this case.\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nXu Qinglang, who had just finished drawing a talisman, came downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze immediately changed the subject and called out, \"Old Xu, what's for lunch?\"\n\n\"I braised pig trotters and stewed pork trotters soup.\"\n\n\"That greasy?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\n\"No, it's because you guys keep saying 'big pig trotters'¹ all day,\n\nI thought you wanted to eat pig trotters, so I made more at once.\"\n\n\".........\"\n\nIn the evening, a car drove to a small road behind an old residential area near the Little Stone Bridge.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the passenger seat, holding a driver's license with his photo on it.\n\n\"We're here, shall we get out and take a look? Boss.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't nod immediately but asked while holding the driver's license, \"That's not right, Old Zhang. You just started working today, and you managed to pull strings and get me a driver's license this quickly?\"\n\nEven if everyone gave face to the new captain of the criminal investigation team, it shouldn't have been so fast.\n\nThat's right, Old Zhang used this driver's license to finally get Zhou Ze to agree to accompany him to the scene of the body disposal sixteen years ago.\n\n\"Hehe, actually, I made it before I died and forgot to give it to you. It was kept at my house. I secretly went back home this afternoon to get it.\"\n\nOld Zhang scratched his head, looking a bit embarrassed.\n\n\"Hiss... So, if I hadn't asked for your help this time, you wouldn't have given it to me, right?\"\n\n\"Hehe, after all, this kind of thing is against the rules. But since you can drive, how should I put it, it's not legal but it's reasonable. Moreover, this involves a sixteen-year-old cold case, so it's worth it.\"\n\nAlthough Boss Zhou was very unhappy with Old Zhang's attitude towards his superior, he still opened the car door and got out.\n\nHaving been caught for driving without a license a few times, Boss Zhou really needed this certificate.\n\nThe road wasn't very wide, only a two-lane road with streetlights on the side.\n\nZhou Ze stretched his waist. Zhang Yanfeng, following his memory and the case file, pointed to a spot by the corner wall ahead and said,\n\n\"This was a spot where a body part was dumped. And around the same spot under that streetlight ahead, and then the manhole cover further ahead, were also disposal sites.\n\nCoupled with clues from later investigations and interviews, most of the people who found meat were on this road.\n\nThis means that sixteen years ago, after killing someone, the murderer came here to dump a body part every day for at least half a month continuously.\"\n\nListening to Old Zhang's detailed description and location markers,\n\neven though Boss Zhou appeared somewhat nonchalant on the surface,\n\nimages seemed to surface in his mind.\n\nA young woman was murdered,\n\nand her body was dismembered and scattered on this road.\n\nIf an ordinary person heard about this case and stood here, they would probably feel a chill wind.\n\nSince they were here, there was no need to be too perfunctory. Zhou Ze walked around and looked. Although the road wasn't wide, there were quite a few pedestrians and vehicles passing by.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze pointed to a spot under a streetlight on the other side, where there was a small newspaper stall and an old woman sitting there, with her head bowed.\n\nHer silver hair fluttered in the night breeze, and she herself was motionless.\n\n\"That one?\" Zhang Yanfeng frowned and asked with some concern, \"Is it a ghost?\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, \"You've become a ghost yourself, and you're still afraid of ghosts?\"\n\n\"I haven't fully adapted to my new identity yet.\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nZhang Yanfeng proactively walked over and started talking to the old woman.\n\nAfter a while, Zhang Yanfeng walked back and said, \"She's just an old person who has been setting up a stall and selling newspapers here for many years.\"\n\n\"Then you block for me,\" Zhou Ze said, then squatted down.\n\nZhang Yanfeng stood beside Zhou Ze, blocking the view of passing pedestrians and vehicles.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew out a bit, and then pierced into the road.\n\nBlack mist began to dissipate,\n\nbut it only circled around Zhou Ze and didn't point in any direction.\n\nZhou Ze pulled his hand out,\n\nclapped his hands,\n\nand said, \"No traces of ghosts.\"\n\nThe old woman selling newspapers, who was on the other side, had raised her head at some point. While holding her cup and drinking water, she looked at Zhou Ze and Zhang Yanfeng's location.\n\nAs if curious about what these two people were doing there in the middle of the night.\n\nZhang Yanfeng gritted his teeth, put his hands on his hips, and looked around. He knew that this case was very difficult to solve, and practically impossible, but he still hoped to try by supernatural means.\n\nBut reality remained so cruel.\n\nSixteen years ago, the young woman who was murdered here, not to mention finding her killer, they couldn't even find out her identity.\n\nShe was like a transparent person,\n\nquietly coming into this world,\n\nand quietly leaving it.\n\nAs a police officer, Old Zhang felt a buried guilt towards this victim.\n\nIn Old Zhang's heart,\n\n\"a life is of utmost importance.\"\n\n\"Dropped something?\"\n\nthe old woman called out.\n\n\"Yes, dropped something, looking for it,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Dropped what? A phone, or a wallet?\"\n\n\"Dropped a few pieces of meat,\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\nThis old woman was a living person, not a ghost.\n\nThe old woman chuckled and scolded, \"I kindly asked if you dropped something, and you're tricking an old woman? You bad kid.\"\n\n\"Let's go, Old Zhang,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nOld Zhang nodded unwillingly,\n\nand could only\n\nleave.\n\nWhen they returned to the study, it was only midnight. Boss Zhou worked the night shift until three in the morning. He dealt with a visiting ghost, sent him to hell to complete a performance, and then returned to his room with Yingying to sleep.\n\nNormally, Zhou Ze would sleep until around nine in the morning because he slept late at night. But today, Bai Yingying woke him up around seven in the morning.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nHe knew that Bai Yingying wouldn't interrupt his sleep without an urgent matter.\n\n\"Boss, Old Zhang called and said it was an urgent matter and told me to wake you up no matter what.\"\n\nBai Yingying pouted. She was very dissatisfied with Old Zhang. In her opinion, nothing was as important as Boss sleeping.\n\nZhou Ze felt like cursing.\n\nCould it be that this Old Zhang was bringing up another old case and asking him for help?\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Boss, someone died, someone died!\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze was a bit confused. \"Who died?\"\n\n\"The old woman who sells newspapers that we saw last night, do you remember?\n\nShe was found dead in her home this morning!\"\n\n\".........\"\n\nThe previous chapter updated after midnight today and this chapter are additional updates for six thousand and seven thousand monthly votes respectively, but I forgot to add the note to the previous chapter.\n\nThis means there are two more updates today.\n\nDon't panic, hug the dragon!",

    "content": "Generally, crime scenes are inseparable from a few key elements.\n\nPolice and their cordon,\nThe body, bloodstains, and uniformed forensic pathologists,\nAnd of course,\nThe onlookers, gathered three layers deep.\n\nThe old Taoist priest cleared a path through the crowd for Zhou Ze and escorted him in.\nTaking a breath,\nHe felt a sense of déjà vu.\nHe remembered his previous boss also liked to investigate cases,\nAnd in the process of investigating, almost got himself killed.\nLooking at his current boss behind him, Boss Zhou wore a disgusted expression, clearly reluctant to be there.\nThe old Taoist priest let out a long sigh,\nAt least,\nThe current boss wasn't very interested in investigating cases.\n\nOver there, Zhang Yanfeng also arrived and met Zhou Ze, ushering him in.\nZhou Ze saw the tall, thin female police officer again, and she noticed him too.\nThe female officer was likely also wondering what Zhou Ze's background was, that both the former and current heads of the criminal investigation team liked to ask for his help.\n\nZhang Yanfeng directed the team with practiced ease. That was only natural, as he'd been working there for twenty years; he had merely changed bodies.\nThis gave many of the officers the illusion that their new chief was very similar to the one who had recently sacrificed his life, with essentially the same investigative style.\nHowever, everyone was quite used to it. After the old captain's sacrifice, they had missed hearing him curse and reprimand people for a while.\nOld Zhang led Zhou Ze to see the body first. It was the old woman who had been selling newspapers by the roadside yesterday.\n\nForensic pathologists and their assistants were examining the body, and the preliminary autopsy report was out.\n\"The cause of death was a severe blow to the back of the head. The time of death was approximately in the latter half of the night. The body was discovered by a passerby at six in the morning. Since we both left here at half past eleven last night, we can pretty much narrow down the approximate time of death.\n\"Also, look here.\n\"This is a rural cement road, and this is the deceased's tricycle. According to preliminary inquiries with the deceased's family, she usually set up her stall to sell newspapers near the Little Stone Bridge around six in the evening. She would return with her tricycle after selling out of papers, or at the latest by one in the morning.\n\"If she sold out of papers early, she would return earlier.\n\"This location is about a twenty-minute tricycle ride from where we saw her selling newspapers yesterday. And this is not far from the deceased's home, which is behind that field. Her husband passed away a few years ago, and her son had already married and moved out, so she lived alone in the old house.\"\n\nAfter giving a general overview of the situation, Zhang Yanfeng lowered his voice and asked Zhou Ze,\n\"Why didn't I see a soul?\"\n\"Likely went straight to hell,\" Zhou Ze replied.\nIf every deceased person's soul had to visit the bookstore, Boss Zhou would have become immensely wealthy by now, counting ghostly banknotes at home until his hands went numb.\n\nZhou Ze also squatted down, got a pair of gloves from the forensic pathologist, and briefly examined the body. Although Boss Zhou wasn't a forensic pathologist, an experienced surgeon could still make deductions from superficial observations.\nThe cause of death was indeed a severe blow to the back of the head.\n\"What is this red powder?\" Zhou Ze asked, pointing to the dust on the hair at the back of the deceased's head.\n\"It's red brick,\" the female forensic pathologist replied directly. \"Preliminary deduction is that the murder weapon was a brick. Someone has been sent to search the vicinity, but there's no feedback yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he understood.\nThese days, there were many crime dramas and detective novels. While much of it was fabricated, there were also many realistic elements.\nHe remembered a documentary detailing forensic techniques that was filmed in the US years ago. It was later suspended because it could also serve as an educational film for criminals during their crimes.\nAt least, in recent years, unless it was a pure crime of passion, the proportion of murderers who premeditated and prepared their crimes, concealed their weapons, erased fingerprints, and tried their best not to leave DNA traces, had been continuously increasing.\nIf the murder weapon was just a brick, the killer could take it with them after the murder and casually discard it in an inconspicuous place. It would be very difficult for the police to find.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and looked at the tricycle parked to the side, which was also cordoned off. Next to the tricycle, on the ground, was a chalk outline of a human figure, presumably the position in which the deceased was found.\n\"See anything, Boss?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked quietly.\n\"What I see, you must see too.\"\nZhou Ze didn't believe an old detective would be inferior to him.\n\nIn fact,\nThe details of the crime were already very clear.\nOne could even vividly imagine the scene at the time.\nThe old woman was riding her tricycle home around 12:30 AM.\nThen, a shadowy figure carrying a brick rushed up from behind and struck the old woman, who was riding, directly. The old woman fell off the tricycle and died.\nAn elderly person riding a tricycle is very slow. An adult could catch up with a slight sprint.\n\n\"This is a rural road area with no surveillance cameras, and since it was late at night, the probability of having witnesses is very low.\"\nSaying this,\nZhang Yanfeng added sternly,\n\"Most importantly, isn't all of this too coincidental?\"\nZhou Ze nodded. Yes, it was too coincidental.\nYesterday, he and Old Zhang went to see the body disposal site from sixteen years ago and encountered this old woman, and then the old woman was immediately murdered.\nHe wasn't Conan, nor did he have a halo that attracted death wherever he went.\nAlthough there was no direct evidence, instinct made people unable to help but connect the two cases.\n\n\"What's today's date?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\"August 16th,\" Zhang Yanfeng replied.\n\"Yesterday was the 15th. When did the body disposal case from sixteen years ago happen?\" Zhou Ze asked.\nThat case was something Zhang Yanfeng had never given up on, so the details of that case were almost imprinted in his mind. Without flipping through case files, he replied directly:\n\"The remains were discovered on...\n*Cough, cough,*\n\"The remains were discovered on September 1st, 2002. Later, through door-to-door inquiries, the earliest person known to have found body parts and taken them home was on August 17th, 2002.\"\n\"'August 17th, August 15th,'\" Zhou Ze repeated, then said, \"August 17th was the earliest date body parts were discovered, but the time of death was likely a bit earlier.\"\n\"You mean...?\"\n\"Yesterday was the 15th, and the 2012 case also happened in August. Is it possible that yesterday was actually the sixteenth anniversary of the dismemberment murder victim's death?\"\nZhang Yanfeng's face twitched.\nHe didn't think Zhou Ze was being far-fetched or talking nonsense,\nBecause this possibility was indeed very high.\nThe tendency for murderers to revisit crime scenes, mingle with onlookers to observe, had become almost a law.\nIt was like how people like to look back at their excrement after defecating, as if to admire it.\nZhang Yanfeng's expression contorted, and his breathing became more rapid, his fingers trembling with anger.\n\"In other words, it's highly likely that yesterday, shortly after we left, the killer also went there.\n\"Even,\n\"Perhaps when we were there,\n\"The killer might have brushed past us!\"\nOld Zhang clenched his fists tightly.\nIf the killer had truly brushed past him yesterday,\nThis would be a form of humiliation,\nA humiliation to his profession!\n\"You investigate here first. Perhaps we're overthinking it. In this world, how could such a coincidence happen, right?\"\nZhang Yanfeng nodded with some difficulty, and then said, \"I really hope it's him. Sixteen years ago, due to limitations in the conditions, he was able to evade the law for so many years. If it's him killing again this time, I will absolutely not let him escape.\"\nZhou Ze patted Zhang Yanfeng on the shoulder and then walked out.\nThe old Taoist priest immediately followed, and they got into the car.\nThe old Taoist priest sat in the driver's seat, started the car, and asked, \"Boss, shall we go back to the bookstore?\"\n\"No, to the Little Stone Bridge.\"\nNot long after,\nThe car drove onto the small road where Zhou Ze and Old Zhang had been yesterday.\nAfter getting out of the car,\nZhou Ze sat down on the curb.\nHe vaguely remembered\nJoking with the newspaper-selling old woman yesterday.\nShe had asked him if he had lost something and had come back to look for it.\nHe had jokingly replied, \"Yes, I lost a few pieces of meat.\"\n\"Boss, is this the place where the dismemberment case from sixteen years ago happened, as Officer Zhang mentioned?\"\n\"Mm.\"\n\"Tsk tsk.\"\nThe old Taoist priest began to look around.\nBut sixteen years had passed. For a big city, sixteen years was enough to bring about earth-shattering changes.\nWhy did the old woman die?\nHad the killer from the dismemberment case sixteen years ago really reappeared and started killing again?\nAnd why did he want to kill this old woman?\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\nActually,\nThere was one more thing Zhou Ze had noticed.\nSelling newspapers shouldn't be done on the street. One should set up a stall in a place with high foot traffic. Why was the old woman selling newspapers on this small road late at night?\nThis didn't make logical sense. An elderly person living alone after her son had moved out to start his own family, selling newspapers, should prioritize selling as many newspapers as possible to supplement her income.\n\"Boss, what you said to Officer Zhang earlier, that the killer might have been here yesterday when you two came? Isn't that too much of a coincidence? After all, sixteen years have passed, and the killer might have already died.\"\nZhou Ze didn't answer,\nInstead, he looked up,\nTowards the wall adjacent to the small road.\nBehind the wall was an old apartment building.\nZhou Ze suddenly froze,\nAs if a bolt of lightning had struck his mind.\nCould there be another possibility,\nThat is,\nThe killer,\nHad been living in this dormitory building for the past sixteen years?\nWhen he and Old Zhang came here last night,\nThat killer,\nWas actually standing behind a window in a room on a certain floor,\nHis gaze,\nWas he looking this way?",

    "content": "While the conjecture felt absurd, it seemed not entirely impossible, and for some reason, this premonition began to grow stronger.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly.\n\nHe reached out and touched the bronze ring he always wore on his left ring finger.\n\nThis ring was obtained in Sanxiang Village and was used once after a consciousness awakened at General Mountain.\n\nAfter that,\n\nit hadn't been used again.\n\nBoss Zhou actually had quite a few treasures like this.\n\nFor example, the Yin-Yang Register<sup>1</sup> couldn't be used yet. Even after the old Taoist brought weasels and snakes, they couldn't emerge. Later, he had the old Taoist stew a pot for everyone to drink the soup.\n\nThe \"Sha Bi\"<sup>2</sup> was only used to seal that consciousness the first time, and hadn't been used since.\n\nThis ring was the same.\n\nIt was a bit like playing an online game. You got divine gear, happily thinking of showing it off, but it prompted you that you couldn't equip it due to insufficient level.\n\nThis bronze ring could be used to form a large barrier, but if only Zhou Ze himself used it, it could only form an illusionary scene that \"enveloped\" him.\n\nIn simple terms, it was a bit like VR glasses, but you could design a simple, crude scene to enter. It wouldn't fool others, only yourself.\n\nA truly chicken-rib<sup>3</sup> usage.\n\nThe blue light screen slowly expanded.\n\nBut to the old Taoist standing beside him,\n\ntheir boss suddenly sat there motionless, not even blinking. Even in his boss's eyes, it seemed like blue light was flowing.\n\nThe old Taoist hesitated, squatted down, and waved his hand in front of his boss, but his boss still didn't react.\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\nThe old Taoist called out softly,\n\nbut he didn't dare to reach out and touch him.\n\nMeanwhile, for Zhou Ze, the small road beside him was undergoing constant changes.\n\nHe had seen the case file. Although it didn't have photos of the victims' identities, it did have photos of the body-dumping scene at that time.\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nthe asphalt road beside Zhou Ze began to degrade, turning into an asphalt road.\n\nThe streetlights on both sides of the road also began to disappear gradually.\n\nAntique,\n\ndim,\n\nbecame the main tone.\n\nThe green plants behind Zhou Ze and the pedestrian street further away also began to dissipate, replaced by a textile factory.\n\nThe general layout was about like this. Zhou Ze couldn't achieve anything more specific or grand.\n\nA young woman walked from one end of the asphalt road.\n\nHer specific appearance and the clothes she wore were all blurry. One could only know that she was a young... woman.\n\nBoss Zhou didn't add anything superfluous. If it was pixelated, it was pixelated. Just make do with the general idea.\n\nWell,\n\nit was too bright.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nthe sky darkened.\n\nWhen the woman reached Zhou Ze,\n\nfrom behind her, a silhouette suddenly rushed out. Zhou Ze designed this silhouette like the ones commonly used in \"Detective Conan.\"\n\nThe silhouette rushed towards the woman.\n\nBefore making a move,\n\nZhou Ze frowned again.\n\nNo,\n\nthis might not be the place to strike.\n\nThis was a body-dumping scene, not a murder scene. The killer wouldn't be dismembering the body here, not even at night.\n\nThe picture began to distort.\n\nThe scene was still the original one, but the girl was gone.\n\nThe \"Conan-style\" silhouette was still there.\n\nIt was carrying a plastic bag,\n\nand walked back from the other end of the road.\n\nThen, it placed the plastic bag on the ground and left.\n\nZhou Ze looked up.\n\nFrom the window of a room on a certain floor of the apartment building opposite, which didn't look that old yet, the silhouette appeared.\n\nA passerby appeared. He discovered the bag and the meat inside. It was clearly fresh meat, not rotten. He picked up the meat and happily went back.\n\nThe silhouette kept watching from above.\n\nAs if appreciating all of this, appreciating its own... prank.\n\nYou could even see the white teeth of the silhouette exposed.\n\nIt was\n\nsmiling.\n\nA wave of fatigue washed over him.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes. When he opened them again, everything had returned to normal. The old Taoist was squatting in front of him, his face almost touching his own.\n\n\"What are you doing!\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe old Taoist jumped back and sat on the ground, startled.\n\n\"Boss, I saw you suddenly sitting there motionless and was really scared.\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his forehead, feeling a bit annoyed.\n\nThe biggest problem now was still the death of the old woman selling newspapers. Did her death have any connection to the body-dumping case sixteen years ago?\n\nIf there was a connection, why did the killer kill her?\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. It was Lawyer An.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hello, Boss, where are you?\"\n\n\"At Xiao Shiqiao. What's up?\"\n\n\"I found a few places nearby suitable for accumulating merit points. Do you have time to go take a look?\"\n\nLawyer An had been busy helping Zhou Ze advance to the position of Captain of Investigators.\n\n\"In a couple of days.\"\n\n\"That's fine, no rush anyway. What are you doing then?\"\n\n\"Investigating a case.\"\n\n\"Heh, that's a good hobby. Great. Then I'll go eat at the old place by myself. Want to join?\"\n\n\"Old An, do you have any research on corpses?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\nBecause he remembered that Lawyer An was an expert in handling refrigerated corpses, usually self-producing and self-consuming, without any intermediaries making a profit.\n\n\"Hmm?\" Lawyer An immediately replied, \"Not familiar, not very familiar.\"\n\nSometimes,\n\nsluggish<sup>4</sup> people\n\ncan sense each other.\n\nLawyer An clearly wasn't being honest, putting on an act of not wanting to meddle in other people's business. This was very similar to Zhou Ze's mindset, so Zhou Ze sensed it.\n\nIt wasn't that he couldn't,\n\nbut that he was too lazy to.\n\nCompared to the extremely boring task of investigating cases, Lawyer An preferred to find his club's young models.\n\n\"Come help me investigate. I'll send you my current location.\"\n\n\"Boss, this...\"\n\n\"I didn't want to get involved originally, but the old woman I spoke to yesterday was murdered right after I left. That makes me very uncomfortable.\"\n\nBoss Zhou didn't have the noble spirit of \"people's policeman\" like Old Zhang.\n\nBut if the killer had brushed past him yesterday, or was truly standing in the apartment building opposite, watching them, and then killed that old woman.\n\nThis gave Zhou Ze a very unpleasant feeling.\n\nLawyer An still came, albeit reluctantly. He drove his luxury car and parked it by the roadside. He rolled down the window and asked curiously,\n\n\"Where's the body?\"\n\n\"The body?\"\n\n\"Yes, the body, Boss, has it been disposed of?\"\n\n\"The crime scene isn't here,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nLawyer An lit a cigarette and smiled, saying,\n\n\"Forget it. Since I'm already here, I'll help you to the end. Call Old Zhang and have him make arrangements. I want to 'see' the body alone.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n...\n\nIn the police station's forensic laboratory, the body had undergone preliminary treatment and was ready for dissection.\n\nOld Zhang, biting the bullet, asked the female forensic doctor and her assistant to leave first. This puzzled everyone in the forensic lab, and doing so didn't comply with regulations.\n\nHowever, Old Zhang was now the new \"new official\" making his presence felt, so no one was willing to cross him at this moment. Judging by the new captain of the criminal investigation team's conduct since taking office, he clearly had the demeanor of a seasoned detective. What if he intended to make an example of someone to assert his authority?\n\nOld Zhang wiped the sweat from his forehead. He knew this wasn't by the book, driving out the forensic staff and then bringing in outsiders to see the body.\n\nBut since his rebirth,\n\nOld Zhang had completely let loose.\n\nAs long as the real killer could be found and justice served for the deceased, whether the process followed the rules was no longer within Old Zhang's consideration.\n\nMost importantly, he knew himself that solving the case from sixteen years ago was virtually hopeless through human means unless a miracle occurred. He could only hope that his boss and others like them, who were \"non-human,\" could find a way to break the deadlock.\n\nLawyer An was observing the body and said with some relief, \"Fortunately, it hasn't been dissected yet, otherwise I wouldn't be able to do anything.\"\n\n\"What are you planning to do?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Heh heh, corpses have memories. To be precise, human memory is not only stored in one's soul. For example, athletes can rely on long-term, high-intensity training to form habitual memory in their muscles and body, which can save thinking and reaction time.\"\n\n\"Can you read the deceased's memories?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nUpon hearing this,\n\nthe old Taoist beside them suddenly froze.\n\nLawyer An shook his head, \"I'm very sorry, I don't have the ability to read directly. Perhaps someone else does.\"\n\n\"Then isn't that just stating the obvious?\" Old Zhang said helplessly.\n\n\"If I can't read them, then I can make the corpse tell us.\" Lawyer An took off the glove on his left hand. As he spoke, the flesh and skin on his left hand began to recede slowly, revealing stark white bones.\n\nThe five finger bones repeatedly bent and straightened, giving a very strange feeling.\n\n\"Everyone, step back a bit. Next, it's time to witness a miracle.\"\n\nLawyer An placed his bony palm on the deceased's forehead.\n\nRed patterns began to emanate from his palm, line after line, gradually covering the entire corpse.\n\nThen, Lawyer An withdrew his hand and reminded them,\n\n\"With my skill, I can only stimulate the corpse to perform the actions it was doing in the five minutes before death. Moreover, this spell can only be used once per corpse. I improved it from the methods of the ancient Xiangxi<sup>5</sup> corpse handlers.\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking,\n\nthe old woman, who had been lying quietly on the steel bed, suddenly opened her eyes.\n\nThen,\n\nher corpse began to move, stiffly but resolutely.\n\nHer hands were raised, slightly bent.\n\nHer feet kept lifting and lowering repeatedly.\n\nHer entire body was wriggling on the steel bed in a very uncoordinated posture, looking extremely bizarre.\n\n\"What is she doing?\" the old Taoist asked upon seeing this.\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment and replied,\n\n\"She's... riding a tricycle.\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> **Yin-Yang Register (陰陽冊)**: Likely a magical artifact or text related to spiritual or supernatural matters in the context of the story.\n\n<sup>2</sup> **Sha Bi (煞筆)**: In this context, it refers to a \"pen\" or \"brush\" with some kind of sealing power, likely a supernatural item. The term \"Sha\" often relates to malevolent or baleful energy.\n\n<sup>3</sup> **Chicken-rib (雞肋)**: An idiom referring to something that is not very useful but also not worth discarding, hence \"chicken ribs\" – a meager portion that's still a bit of sustenance.\n\n<sup>4</sup> **Sluggish (鹹魚)**: Literally \"salted fish,\" this is a Chinese internet slang term used to describe someone who is lazy, unmotivated, or has given up on pursuing their goals.

    "content": "\"She's making the same movements she did when she rode her bicycle home last night.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng finally understood. Although seeing a dead body start moving always gave him goosebumps, he had to continue observing seriously now that it was for the investigation.\n\nOf course, Old Zhang was also worried. If the corpse kept moving and then just slumped over and died, what would be the point of all this fuss?\n\nAfter all, according to the preliminary clues from the investigation, the old lady was likely on her way home riding a tricycle when someone caught up to her from behind and killed her with a brick.\n\nPerhaps the old lady herself didn't even know who had killed her.\n\nHowever, at this moment, the old lady, who had been making cycling motions, suddenly stopped.\n\nHer head also twisted to the side, and her mouth began to open and close incessantly.\n\n\"She... she was talking then!\"\n\nOld Zhang exclaimed immediately, grabbing Lawyer An's shoulder and asking, \"Why no sound? Why no sound?\"\n\nLawyer An rolled his eyes at Old Zhang. \"It's enough to have the action, and you want sound too? It's like buying an inflatable doll and expecting it to cook for you.\"\n\nThis,\n\nno sound,\n\nand he didn't know what she had said.\n\nOld Zhang immediately took out his phone to record, but as soon as he opened the camera, the old lady turned her head back and resumed her tricycle-riding motion.\n\nThen,\n\nthe old lady's head suddenly lurched forward.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nher hands and feet all fell down together, no longer moving.\n\nA heavy blow to the back of her head with a brick had killed her instantly.\n\nMost importantly, Old Zhang hadn't even managed to record the old lady's lip movements when she was speaking, otherwise, he could have found a specialized research institute to do a lip-reading analysis.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the body,\n\nlay down silently,\n\nand the people around watched him.\n\n\"Boss, what are you doing?\" the old Taoist priest asked, then seemed to realize something and immediately said, \"Boss, you can't do that. I know it's cool here, but you can't take a nap here.\"\n\nZhou Ze ignored the old Taoist priest. Instead, he raised his hands and pedaled with his feet.\n\nHe was imitating the old lady's cycling movements.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze began to recall the scene he had just witnessed, his neck twisting, his body tilting to the side. After memorizing the arc, Zhou Ze got up and stood up.\n\nLawyer An stood with his hands in his pockets, watching Zhou Ze's performance, while the old Taoist priest was completely baffled.\n\nOld Zhang immediately figured out the connection and stood behind Zhou Ze, perfectly straight behind him.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze stood up,\n\nhis feet remained still, but his hands reached out, making the motion of holding the handlebars of a tricycle. Then, his waist tilted to the side, and his head twisted.\n\nEverything was an attempt to replicate the movements he could make while lying on the ground, now standing up.\n\nBecause when Lawyer An made the old lady \"rise from the dead\" to perform, she had no props and was lying down.\n\nTherefore, from the perspective of Zhou Ze and the others, some movements were not very three-dimensional.\n\nAs Zhou Ze's waist tilted and his neck twisted,\n\nZhou Ze's upper body turned almost completely to the side, and with the rotation of his head,\n\nhis gaze\n\nmet directly with that of Officer Zhang behind him.\n\n\"The killer was sitting on the old lady's tricycle!\"\n\n\"The killer was sitting on the tricycle!\"\n\nZhou Ze and Old Zhang blurted out simultaneously.\n\nAccording to the old lady's movements in the minutes before her death, yes, that was correct. The old lady had spoken to the killer, and the killer had indeed attacked from behind, but not by rushing up from behind as the police had initially speculated. The killer was sitting on the back of the tricycle.\n\nLast night,\n\nthe old lady had given the killer a ride,\n\nheading home together!\n\nOld Zhang immediately took out his phone and called his subordinates, beginning to instruct them:\n\n\"Re-investigate the old lady's family relationships and social connections. Focus on whether there were any short people around her, any adults of smaller stature.\"\n\nJudging by the force of the brick attack, it couldn't have been a child, as children wouldn't have that much strength. However, since the perpetrator could sit on an old lady's tricycle, their build wouldn't be very large either.\n\nIn fact,\n\nit was possible they were like someone with dwarfism.\n\n\"Also, check all the current residents of the two old apartment buildings near the dumping site of the body. Focus on old residents who have lived there for at least sixteen years,\" Zhou Ze added after a moment of thought, \"The age range can be broader, over thirty-five, and don't spare the elderly.\"\n\nBecause,\n\nin Zhou Ze's opinion,\n\nif the two murder cases were indeed committed by the same perpetrator,\n\nsixteen years ago,\n\nthe perpetrator, after dismembering the body,\n\nclearly acted with a playful, leisurely mindset, very relaxed and comfortable.\n\nIn the case from sixteen years ago, the killer simply bashed the person to death with a brick and left.\n\nAlthough both were murders, their attitude towards the act of killing was completely different.\n\nOf course, there could be many conjectures, such as the advancement of police forensic technology, or the presence of surveillance cameras in many places, prompting the killer to avoid risks. But one conjecture was the most likely:\n\nthe killer\n\nwas old.\n\n\"Okay, I understand. I'll pass on the instructions immediately,\" Old Zhang nodded and made another call.\n\n\"All done? Shall we go find a place to eat?\" Lawyer An asked, then glanced meaningfully at Zhou Ze, \"Eating for real.\"\n\nThe three then left the police station and went to a hot pot restaurant near Xiao Shiqiao.\n\nAs soon as Zhou Ze entered the restaurant, he had a premonition of misfortune.\n\nThis was because hot pot, with its heavy oil and spice, was something that ghosts found most detestable and repulsive.\n\nAs expected,\n\nafter a large order of dishes and a pot of oil were placed on the table, Lawyer An looked at Zhou Ze and beckoned, \"Boss, how about some Lycoris radiata juice?\"\n\nZhou Ze instinctively wanted to refuse.\n\nHe knew very well that his current eating habits were all under Lawyer An's watchful eye. Boss Zhou knew that he could get away with fooling Liu Chuyu and Old Zhang with the \"hardship before success\" kind of motivational talk, but he definitely couldn't fool Lawyer An.\n\n\"Considering I helped you with the case today, this is extra work, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed, took out a bottle, and handed it to Lawyer An.\n\nLawyer An took it, examined it for a moment, then drank it all in one gulp. Immediately after, he stared greedily at the hot pot in front of him.\n\nTears even began to stream down his face.\n\n\"Finally, I can eat hot pot heartily again!!!\"\n\nAt this moment, the waitress brought over the tripe and pork aorta. Seeing Lawyer An like this, she was startled.\n\nIn this day and age, it was truly rare to see someone moved to tears by a meal of hot pot.\n\n\"How much ability do you still have on you?\" Zhou Ze asked, picking up a piece of tender beef and placing it on his plate.\n\n\"Not too much, not too little, just enough. After all, I've been around for many years,\" Lawyer An said nonchalantly, continuously adding and scooping dishes, eating with great gusto.\n\n\"I don't have much of that stuff left,\" Zhou Ze warned him first.\n\n\"I know, I know, but it's okay. I found someone growing Lycoris radiata in Changzhou before. When you finish that, we can go to Changzhou sometime.\"\n\n\"Is this situation becoming very common?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I told you, the wind has started blowing. But what kind of wind it is, and what it will blow down, I don't know. Even if I were reinstated immediately, I wouldn't be qualified to know.\n\nAt this point, any kind of chaos is not surprising.\"\n\nThe three of them thoroughly enjoyed the delicious hot pot meal, exclaiming with satisfaction.\n\nAfter leaving the hot pot restaurant, the old Taoist priest pointed at the simply decorated foot massage parlor across the street and asked,\n\n\"Shall we get a foot rub to relax?\"\n\nLawyer An smacked his lips. Clearly, like the old Taoist priest, he had high demands in that regard, but their tastes were too different, and they couldn't satisfy each other.\n\n\"Let's go back,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Tsk.\" Lawyer An shook his head helplessly. He knew of a good high-end club nearby.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The old Taoist priest was also disappointed. He had several \"big sisters\" in need of care in the vicinity.\n\nThe two looked at each other and reached a tacit understanding at this moment: next time they felt the urge for such things after a good meal,\n\nthey wouldn't bring this mood-killing boss along.\n\nLawyer An drove his own car and left first. As the old Taoist priest started his car, Zhou Ze added, \"Let's go over there again.\"\n\n\"Alright, boss.\"\n\nThe car drove into that small road again.\n\nThe two got out of the car. Zhou Ze stood by the roadside, looking at the old apartment building ahead. When they arrived, Zhou Ze had already seen several police cars parked outside the complex.\n\nThe police officers arranged by Old Zhang should be investigating as he had instructed.\n\nOld Zhang didn't ask for the reason,\n\nnor did he need to.\n\nThe old Taoist priest looked at Zhou Ze, then at the apartment building ahead, and shook his head helplessly. In his opinion, the boss had gotten addicted to playing Conan games.\n\nAt this moment, he went to the trash can to extinguish his cigarette butt. As he tossed it, he noticed a red plastic bag next to the trash can.\n\nThe old Taoist priest didn't pay attention at first. After all, discarding household garbage bags next to the trash can was considered a relatively civilized behavior.\n\nHe kicked the garbage bag with his foot, intending to nudge it closer to the trash can. To his surprise, it felt like he had kicked something very soft.\n\nThe old Taoist priest's eyes widened immediately.\n\nHoly crap,\n\nno way,\n\nwhy always me?\n\nHe swallowed,\n\nand nervously crouched down, cautiously reaching out to open the plastic bag.\n\nNo,\n\nimpossible,\n\nit can't be,\n\nit's not that coincidental.\n\nThe plastic bag opened,\n\nrevealing a piece of meat inside.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest gasped sharply,\n\nbut then,\n\nhis mood calmed down.\n\nIt was pork.\n\nThe old Taoist priest could tell the difference. It was called pork belly in the local area, suitable for making streaky pork or braised pork.\n\nThank goodness it wasn't human flesh.\n\nThat really scared this humble Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist priest impatiently kicked the plastic bag.\n\nServes you right for scaring me!\n\nThe plastic bag was kicked over,\n\nand as a result,\n\nanother thing fell out of the plastic bag.\n\nThis time, the old Taoist priest was so scared that he slumped to the ground,\n\npointing at the thing,\n\nhis voice starting to tremble:\n\n\"B-b-bond...\"",

    "content": "「Boss!!! This is bad!!!”\n\nOld Dao shouted himself hoarse, extremely terrified;\n\nWell,\n\nAny normal male friend,\n\nRegardless of age,\n\nRegardless of whether that thing was still functional,\n\nUpon seeing that lump of something fall to the ground,\n\nRight in front of you,\n\nOne inevitably feels a sense of a rabbit dying while a fox grieves. [1]\n\nOld Dao was so startled that he felt the thing in his crotch had entered an ice cellar, shrinking once more into a clearly veined, furrowed walnut.\n\nHonestly,\n\nEven if a ghost or monster suddenly appeared,\n\nOld Dao wouldn’t have been scared to this extent.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, swept his gaze over the thing on the ground, and subconsciously wanted to lick his lips;\n\nThis was Boss Zhou's habitual action when encountering astonishing things.\n\nBut he immediately stopped himself.\n\nTaking out his phone, Zhou Ze called Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nFor a time,\n\nTongcheng Police Bureau was shaken!\n\nBecause this \"fetter,\"\n\nSignified that the culprit of the dismemberment case sixteen years ago,\n\nHad reappeared!\n\nIf,\n\nThe old woman's death was still half-hidden, difficult to fathom,\n\nNow, this \"fetter\" discovered by Old Dao,\n\nFormally signified that person's return.\n\n…………\n\n\"Is he provoking us?\" Lawyer An, standing beside Zhou Ze, asked.\n\nYes,\n\nHe had been on the verge of driving back to the bookstore,\n\nBut after receiving Zhou Ze's call, he had to drive back,\n\nAfter all, he had accepted Zhou Ze's Bian Hua Oral Solution and eaten a hotpot meal,\n\nSo it would truly be impolite to show annoyance to his own boss at this moment.\n\nThen,\n\nLawyer An rushed back,\n\nHis face grim,\n\nFacing that proudly lying \"fetter\" on the ground.\n\n\"I don't know.\" Zhou Ze frowned slightly, \"But I feel like he's making a display.\"\n\nOld Zhang frantically began directing his subordinates; other leaders and officers from the bureau were also dispatched, and even support from nearby city bureaus would arrive soon.\n\nA serial killer who had been dormant for sixteen years had re-emerged. If they couldn't quickly solve the case and bring the culprit to justice, and if the media picked it up, it could very likely become another \"Nan...da Dismemberment Case or Baiyin Case.\"\n\nFrom the police's perspective, imagine if this case were to be ranked among the top ten cold cases or horror cases in the country in the future. That would mean they themselves would be permanently affixed to a pillar of shame.\n\n\"Gather surveillance footage. Yes, I know there are no cameras on this street. I want you to immediately investigate the areas near the entrances and exits that *do* have surveillance. Find all vehicles that might have entered or exited this street from this morning until now, and then go door-to-door, one by one, to retrieve their dashcam footage.\n\nThe culprit casually discarded a trash bag, disguising it as ordinary trash disposal, and it was in broad daylight. It’s very possible that a passing dashcam recorded the process of the culprit discarding the body part!\n\nDon't tell me how difficult the work is. I only want results, no complaints. If you can't complete the task, pack your bags and get out. The police force doesn't need good-for-nothings!\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone,\n\nZhang Yanfeng let out a long breath.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Old Zhang with some surprise, as he found Old Zhang's investigative method quite unique, though it might yield unexpected results.\n\nThanks to the booming business of staged accidents (pengci) in recent years,\n\nAnd thanks to the lack of relevant laws and regulations, and irresponsible, perfunctory enforcement,\n\nDashcams have now become standard vehicle equipment.\n\nOld Zhang actually thought of relying on this to find footage of the culprit discarding trash; truly a fresh approach.\n\nOld Zhang also walked over, breathing heavily and appearing anxious. He even patted Lawyer An's shoulder, pointed at the \"fetter\" in front, and asked:\n\n\"This, do you have a way?\"\n\nLawyer An looked at Officer Zhang with a \"Are you out of your mind?\" expression,\n\nThen asked:\n\n\"You mean you want me to make this 'fetter' move?\n\nMake it tell you how many times it got hard in the five minutes before it died?\"\n\nOld Zhang was momentarily stunned.\n\n\"My apologies, my abilities are limited when it comes to extracting useful information or causing trouble with just a 'fetter.' I can't do that unless you give me a more complete corpse.\n\nHowever, you can ask the boss. He used to be a surgeon. Initially, he might have been assigned to perform circumcisions due to lack of other work;\n\nYou can ask him how to deduce a person's height and weight based on the size of a 'fetter,'\n\nIt's similar to deducing it from a foot.\"\n\n\"Have the previous investigations yielded any results?\" Zhou Ze asked,\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze directly filtered out Lawyer An's even more peculiar topic.\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately nodded, took out his phone, where some records were photographed, and quickly found them:\n\n\"The old woman's son is over forty this year, a burly middle-aged man. The old woman's grandson is only ten this year, and currently, no motive has been found for her son, nor does he have a solid alibi.\"\n\nAccording to Old Zhang's previous speculation, since the old woman was willing to give that person a ride on her tricycle, it must have been someone very close, and they even went home together, so it was very likely a relative.\n\nAs a result, no suitable suspects have been found yet within her social circle, at least, for now,\n\nHer son cannot be the culprit.\n\nOld Zhang then pointed to the two old apartment buildings side by side in front of them, saying, \"Because new body parts were discovered, the officers previously responsible for door-to-door investigations here were immediately called down to secure the scene and evidence, so the investigation here hasn't been completed.\n\nHowever, there are indeed many families who have lived here for sixteen years. Of course, most are elderly, and there are also some recent tenants, many of whom come to Tongcheng for work and rent here. The occupancy rate is very high, and the demographic is somewhat complex.\n\nCurrently, police resources are limited. We must first concentrate our efforts on this body part. We can only temporarily halt the detailed investigation of these two apartment buildings.\"\n\nWhen handling cases, resorting to a needle-in-a-haystack search using human-wave tactics is often a last resort when there are truly no other options.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating understanding.\n\nBut somehow,\n\nBoss Zhou's gaze turned towards the apartment building above,\n\nAlways feeling,\n\nAs if a pair of eyes,\n\nWas watching them from up there.\n\nKilling the old woman sparked the police's suspicions about the case sixteen years ago,\n\nAnd then brazenly discarded another body part in the same spot where he had dumped body parts sixteen years ago,\n\nAnd the part he discarded was this one,\n\nDoes it also represent a certain attitude?\n\nIf he were the culprit at this moment,\n\nHe would probably be in a place where he could clearly see everything, holding a cup of coffee, chuckling as a bunch of police officers frantically ran around in circles because of the \"fetter\" he had thrown out,\n\nWhile taking a sip?\n\n\"Old An,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\n\"Come with me to check out the apartment building ahead.\"\n\n\"Understood, Boss.\"\n\n…………\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe curtain gap had been pulled shut.\n\nBelow,\n\nThere really were so many police.\n\nAn old man with graying hair picked up his teacup filled with goji berries,\n\nAnd took two sips of water.\n\nHe was already old,\n\nAnd one of his legs was lame,\n\nAlthough he always insisted on not using a cane, walking and climbing stairs were very difficult for him.\n\nThe most painful part was living on the sixth floor, and this old building had no elevator.\n\nHis son and daughter had long since started their own families. He had a pension to collect, so he didn't need to depend on his children. Of course, his children were too lazy to visit this ill-tempered old man.\n\n\"Cough cough cough…………\"\n\nContinuous coughing,\n\nA dull pain in his chest,\n\nMade him feel very oppressed, as if a hand was constantly gripping his throat, not very hard, but just holding on like that.\n\nHe leaned against the wall,\n\nBreathing deeply non-stop,\n\nThen,\n\nHe secretly lifted the curtain a little,\n\nAnd took a look at the crowded police on the street below.\n\n\"So fast, really so fast...\"\n\nThe old man mumbled,\n\nHe remembered that back then, he had discarded parts for over half a month. Every day after he finished discarding, he would see his neighbors, as if they had struck gold, taking the meat he left there home to eat.\n\nEating it, their mouths greasy, they even came to play chess with him,\n\nAnd secretly saying he'd been lucky lately.\n\nThen, seeing their smugness, he threw out a dangler,\n\nThe fellow who played chess with him threw up for a week and hardly ate anything.\n\nHe smiled,\n\nHowever,\n\nIt was quite interesting,\n\nHe casually tossed out a dangler,\n\nAnd these police got as anxious as dogs.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nInteresting,\n\nTruly interesting.\n\nThe old man limped, holding his teacup, towards the inner room.\n\nHe pushed open the door to the inner room.\n\nOn the bed,\n\nLay a woman, already dead. Because she had only just died, and the air conditioning in the room was set very low, the corpse hadn't yet emitted a noticeable foul odor.\n\nThe thin old man climbed onto the bed,\n\nAnd lay down beside the woman's corpse.\n\nHe did not molest the woman's corpse;\n\nHe just lay there quietly.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes,\n\nHe opened his eyes again,\n\nAnd slowly climbed out of bed.\n\nThen he limped back to the window, glanced outside, the police were still there, heh heh.\n\n\"Too bad she won't be here tonight.\"\n\nThe old man seemed a little sad.\n\nBut the sadness was only temporary. Soon, a hopeful glint appeared in his eyes again.\n\nHe walked to the bathroom. In the bathtub lay a man's corpse, with several parts cut off, including the area between his legs.\n\n\"How could there be such a good deal just falling from the sky? Renting a place for three hundred yuan a month, they didn't even think how such a good thing would fall to them.\"\n\nThe old man walked out of the bathroom again,\n\nHe sat down on the sofa,\n\nPulled out a \"Da Qianmen\" cigarette,\n\nAnd lit it. He took two puffs, then coughed even more violently, constantly spitting phlegm, but still insisted on continuing to smoke.\n\nHe looked up,\n\nAt the calendar hanging on the wall,\n\nThe old man smoked the cigarette down to just the filter before tossing it away.\n\n\"Cough cough cough\"\n\nIt sounded like a cough,\n\nAnd also like a laugh,\n\n\"Oh,\n\nIt's Qixi Festival today. [2]\"\n\nThe old man waved his hand towards the bathroom and the inner room,\n\n\"Heh, happy festival.\"\n\n---\n[1] A Chinese idiom meaning empathy for a fellow creature suffering a similar fate; lamenting a shared misfortune.\n[2] Qixi Festival: Also known as the Qiqiao Festival, or Chinese Valentine's Day, celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month.",

    "content": "The corridor was a bit dirty and messy, with splotches on the walls and a broken light bulb. Everything about it spoke of the apartment building's age. Even during the day, the lighting inside was poor and dim. If it weren't for the many laborers who chose to rent here, it would have been a perfect place for filming a horror movie.\n\n\"Why are you so invested in this?\" Lawyer An asked, walking behind.\n\n\"I'm bored anyway, and when something interesting comes up, I feel like doing it,\" Mr. Zhou's answer was honest. To those who knew him well, this was indeed a perfectly fitting explanation.\n\nEven a salted fish,\n\noccasionally turns over.\n\n\"That's true, exercising more is good for your health. Actually, Boss, you could sign up for a fitness class. That way, your entire demeanor could change from how it was before,\" Lawyer An had started to learn to take a roundabout approach.\n\n\"I used to be a doctor and treated many patients who had problems due to improper or excessive exercise.\"\n\n\"You're just splitting hairs now.\"\n\n\"It's not splitting hairs. Ancient people worked with the sunrise and rested with the sunset, 'exercising' all day, eating coarse grains, and breathing fresh air without pollution, yet they rarely lived to fifty.\"\n\nLawyer An was stunned for a moment, then shook his head and said, \"The medical conditions were different.\"\n\n\"See, that's you splitting hairs.\"\n\nThe two continued their conversation as they went up another floor. Then, they both stopped.\n\nA scent of blood,\n\nfaint,\n\nbut definitely present! A person's nose couldn't compare to a dog's, but the human body was much more complex. Perhaps this was a sixth sense honed by individual experiences.\n\nIt wasn't the smell of chicken, duck, or livestock blood,\n\nbut human blood,\n\nfaint,\n\nand a little sweet.\n\n\"It's up ahead,\" Lawyer An said.\n\n\"It seems we've found the right place.\"\n\nEven when facing a murderer, there was nothing to be afraid of. The murderer was indeed perverse, possessing a strong sense of malicious fun, but Mr. Zhou and Lawyer An had seen much bigger scenes, so they weren't intimidated.\n\nThe two arrived at a door, which was closed. Zhou Ze picked the lock directly with his fingernails, then pushed the door open. The smell of blood immediately became stronger. The living room, however, was spotless, with everything neatly organized. A thermos mug with goji berries on the coffee table still retained warmth.\n\nAfter entering, Zhou Ze first opened the bathroom door, as the smell of blood was emanating from there. A male corpse lay in the bathtub, his arms hanging limply by the sides, his head resting against one end of the tub, completely unclothed. This scene reminded Zhou Ze of the famous painting, \"The Death of Marat.\"\n\n\"There's another one here, a woman.\" Lawyer An opened the door to the inner room. The female corpse lay on the bed, her hands crossed over her chest, her hair tidied and spread neatly around her.\n\n\"Heh, you guessed correctly.\" Lawyer An took a step back and looked at Zhou Ze, \"Boss, you have talent.\"\n\nWith the dead in front of them,\n\nyet still having the inclination to joke,\n\none couldn't accuse Lawyer An of disregarding life,\n\nbecause Zhou Ze next to him also appeared calm. Having seen countless souls come and go, witnessing so much life and death, one naturally becomes indifferent and detached.\n\n\"Where's the murderer?\"\n\nAs Zhou Ze asked, he took out his phone and dialed Zhang Yanfeng. The call indicated that Officer Zhang was on another call and couldn't be reached. Helplessly, Zhou Ze walked to the window and pulled back the curtain. Below, there were many police officers. For a moment, Zhou Ze didn't rush to call the police below, but turned to look at the thermos mug on the coffee table behind him.\n\nJust now,\n\nwas the murderer also standing here with the thermos mug, watching a group of police officers busy with his mess?\n\nHe had indeed guessed correctly.\n\nZhou Ze picked up a stool from the floor and threw it directly out the window. With a \"crash,\" the police officers on the road below collectively looked up. Old Zhang, who was on the phone, also paused, looked up, and then saw Boss in the window of a fifth-floor apartment room. Zhou Ze smiled at Old Zhang and turned away from the window.\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately reacted, shouting at his subordinates, \"Go to that room, quickly, quickly! Right, Li Yan, take another team and immediately cordon off that apartment building, move fast!\"\n\n\"Middle-aged men have no choice, they put goji berries in their thermos mugs.\" Lawyer An lowered his head and looked at the mug on the coffee table.\n\n\"He doesn't seem to have escaped,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Indeed, he doesn't.\" As he spoke, Lawyer An looked up and said, \"I remember there's a rooftop above, right?\"\n\n...\n\nThere was indeed a rooftop above. When Zhou Ze and Lawyer An went up, they saw an old man in cloth shoes leaning by the railing not far ahead. Hearing footsteps, the old man turned his head, glanced at Zhou Ze and Lawyer An, and asked with some confusion, \"Police?\"\n\nThe old man showed no panic. Zhou Ze guessed that before the two of them came up, the old man was there watching the police busy themselves. When climbing the stairs, he had even heard the old man's intermittent laughter. He found it amusing; it was his pleasure.\n\n\"We are grim reapers, here to claim souls.\"\n\nLawyer An replied.\n\n\"Hmph, embarrassing.\"\n\n\"...\" Lawyer An.\n\nZhou Ze moved half a step to the side, he also felt Lawyer An's earlier playfulness was a bit embarrassing. The old man held a cigarette between his fingers, exhaled a smoke ring, and said, \"I'm old now, and useless. But don't think you police are so great for catching me. I wanted to play one last game myself. Cough, cough, cough...\"\n\nThe old man coughed heavily, then continued laughing, \"I'm dying, liver cancer, late stage, only a few months left to live. But I always felt something was missing. The case from sixteen years ago, no one even knows I did it yet, that's too regrettable, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly walked forward, while Lawyer An remained in place. \"Everyone says I'm old, my children also find me old and think I'm a burden. Yes, I am old. Before, I used to kill people directly by force. Now, I have to use drugs, tsk tsk.\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk forward. \"When people get old, they become useless, they feel it's meaningless. She's the same.\"\n\nSaying that, the old man's gaze flickered downwards.\n\n\"Is it that old newspaper lady?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, didn't she talk to you that day?\" The old man grinned, \"That night, I rode her tricycle home with her to help her change a light bulb. On the way, she told me that two people were looking for something on that road that day. She asked what they were looking for, and those two replied they were looking for meat. She told me this as if it were a joke. Then, I told her about the case from sixteen years ago and asked her, 'Do you believe the murderer was me?' She said she didn't. This old man, who can't even get a word out with eight whips, is bullied by his son and daughter to death, how could he possibly dare to kill someone? Then, to prove it to her, I killed her.\"\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head slightly, \"Was she your lover?\"\n\n\"Yes, you could say that. She sold newspapers here every night, and I met her here. Her son wouldn't let her get involved with anyone else, and my children wouldn't let me either. She said I was cowardly, and she was right, because I didn't dare to argue with my children.\"\n\nZhou Ze finally reached the old man, less than a meter away. \"I told her to wait for me on the road to the underworld. I'm not far behind, you guys came too early. I thought I could still see tonight's stars.\"\n\nThe old man showed some regret, looked up, and gazed at the now azure sky. \"Before dying, I get to play one more time, it's quite happy. By the way, little police officer, have you killed anyone?\"\n\nZhou Ze did not answer.\n\n\"You haven't killed anyone, have you?\" The old man laughed, \"You're too young, you don't understand the feeling of killing someone. A living person, after you kill them, is really no different from a pig on a chopping block, really, no difference. When I was cutting them, I felt as if they were standing beside me, watching me, keeping me company. Are you afraid of the souls of the departed?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You're lying. Who isn't afraid of ghosts? And you haven't even killed anyone.\"\n\n\"Sixteen years ago, after my wife passed away, I was so lonely and desolate, I wanted someone to accompany me. My home was also cold and empty, not presentable. That's why I went to kill. Because I thought, after I killed them, their souls would constantly follow me. They would constantly curse me, cursing me for not getting retribution yet. This would make me feel warm, make me feel like someone was accompanying me all the time. That feeling is truly beautiful.\"\n\n\"Mmm... In fact, there isn't a single ghost in your house.\"\n\n\"Bullshit! How could there not be! You say there aren't any, so there aren't? Heh heh, I know, you young people, especially little police officers, definitely don't believe in ghosts. I understand.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. The old man suddenly pushed off with both hands, his legs pushing off the ground, and flipped himself over the railing. He was going to commit suicide! Yes, from killing the old lady to disposing of the body afterward, he hadn't considered his escape route at all, because he no longer wanted to live, and couldn't live any longer. The reason he reoffended after sixteen years was because he thought it was fun, wanting to play one more time in the final stage of his life. At the same time, he was unwilling that his sixteen-year-old masterpiece went unknown.\n\nThe old man jumped off freely and decisively, looking at the sky. He seemed to see the old lady standing by the tricycle ahead, waiting for him to accompany her to the underworld. She would still be riding in front, and he would still be sitting behind, letting her carry him.\n\n\"Now you know, I wasn't bragging, huh... huh?\"\n\nThe old man froze. Zhou Ze's hand had grasped his shoulder from above, and he was suspended in mid-air, not falling.\n\n\"Let me go!\" the old man shouted.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"That won't do. Dying like this is too easy for you. It would be too boring.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze and Lawyer An sat side-by-side on a bench outside the police station's interrogation room.\n\nOutside the police station was bustling. The media, alerted to the situation, swarmed like sharks smelling blood, but they were held back.\n\nThe police station's statement was that the investigation was ongoing and a press conference would be held later to announce details of the case. Of course, the reporters wouldn't be idle; they could also be working on their stories to refresh the public's memory of the 16-year-old body disposal case in Tongcheng.\n\nMeanwhile, some reporters were discussing how to frame their next news reports to gain maximum attention. For example:\n\n\"Why Did a Lonely Old Man Become a Murderer?\"\n\"Did Indifference from Children and Society Turn an Old Man into a Demon?\"\n\"Unearthing the Truth Behind an Old Man's Descent into Murder!\"\n\"I Want to Cry, Save Our Elderly!\"\n\n...\n\nThe old man wanted to commit suicide, but Zhou Ze saved him. Of course, the reason he saved him wasn't because he wanted him to live, but because he felt such a quick death was too easy for him.\n\nThis case could be said to have been solved very quickly, and at the same time, it could also be said to have been solved very slowly.\n\nThe tall, thin female detective handed over two cups of coffee and then sat in the chair opposite Zhou Ze, starting to send messages. Although the killer had been caught, there were still many details to handle in this case.\n\n\"Have the identities of the two deceased in the house been found?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not yet, but it should be soon. Because the time of death was relatively recent, their original employers likely haven't noticed their disappearance. However, according to the testimony of other residents in the apartment building, this man and woman should be a young couple or lovers, as they were often seen shopping together. They are estimated to be workers in Tongcheng, renting from Yang Kewang's place.\"\n\nYang Kewang was the old man's name.\n\n\"However, Yang Kewang must have done a very thorough job after the murder. Our investigators couldn't find any clues in the house that could prove the victims' identities, such as mobile phones or identification cards. None were found.\"\n\n\"It's been sixteen years, and the bodies are right here, yet it's still so difficult to find out their identities,\" Zhou Ze said with some emotion. After all, this wasn't some remote mountain road, like those in Xichuan or Tibet. Honestly, if you killed someone on those roads and threw them into a ditch by the side, it would be an excellent place for corpse disposal. But this was Tongcheng, a densely populated modern coastal city.\n\n\"In another sixteen years, this problem might be solved. Once identity information collection is further promoted and achieves full coverage, things should be simpler. But don't worry, it's only a matter of time before their identities are confirmed.\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the female detective's phone rang. She answered it and then said to Zhou Ze, \"The identities of the two deceased have been confirmed. They were a young couple working in Tongcheng from XX Province.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. The female detective immediately went to report this news and got up to leave. Zhou Ze reached out and gently rubbed the bridge of his nose.\n\n\"People really aren't that precious,\" Lawyer An said. \"Even though modern people seem to live fulfilling lives; in reality, if you don't order takeout, don't receive packages, and don't log into chat apps, and just leave your phone there, see how many calls you'll get in a day. In this world, there are stars, celebrities, and important people, but the vast majority of people are actually dust, like scallions planted by the roadside. Whether they exist or not, the difference is really not that big. The vast majority of people come and go quietly in this life.\"\n\n\"What exactly are you trying to say?\" Zhou Ze looked at Lawyer An and asked.\n\n\"I want to ask if the muscles in your arm don't hurt?\" As he spoke, Lawyer An grabbed Zhou Ze's arm and rolled up his sleeve. \"Even though that old man was short, wouldn't your muscles be strained if you held him with one hand?\"\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a massage.\"\n\nLawyer An began to massage Zhou Ze's arm. To say the least, it was quite effective. The arm, which had felt a slight tearing sensation with a simple movement, gradually stopped hurting.\n\n\"You're quite suited to opening a massage parlor.\"\n\n\"And you're quite suited to opening a locksmith company.\"\n\nAt this moment, Old Zhang walked over with a stack of papers. Seeing the two men pulling and tugging on the bench, Old Zhang suddenly felt a bit disgusted and coughed to announce his presence. But the two of them continued as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Did he confess?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He confessed everything. His attitude was very cooperative. He said his only hope was to be given a peanut* soon, so his attitude towards confessing was very sincere.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze suddenly felt a bit bored, even losing the desire to punish the guy himself. For someone who had already given up on everything, someone who was一心求死 (seeking death with all their heart), it was hard to derive any pleasure from tormenting them.\n\n\"However, there's one thing that's very troublesome right now,\" Old Zhang said, scratching his hair, looking quite troubled.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"It's the victim from the case sixteen years ago.\"\n\n\"What, her identity hasn't been confirmed?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The old man didn't say?\"\n\n\"He did. He said he forgot, only remembering that he saw her on the street and followed her. He didn't know her specific identity. He only remembered that it was a short-haired woman, around twenty years old.\"\n\nOld Zhang's expression was somber as he spoke these words. The reason he had persisted in investigating this case for so many years, even asking his boss to help, was to seek justice for that poor girl whose identity remained unknown. But now that the real killer had been caught, the girl's identity was still a mystery. Old Zhang was often stubborn and persistent. While this might make him seem difficult to get along with, from another perspective, this quality was indeed something that society lacked today. If he were just an ordinary police officer, Boss Zhou probably wouldn't have bothered to help him be reborn.\n\n\"However, he did reveal where the girl's remains were buried sixteen years ago,\" Old Zhang said. \"And some of the girl's personal belongings were buried along with them.\"\n\n\"Remains?\"\n\n\"Yes, remains. He said he only cut off the flesh at the time and deliberately preserved the integrity of the bone structure.\"\n\n\"Sixteen years have passed, and they likely didn't do any good protective treatment when burying them,\" Zhou Ze sighed. \"Let's go take a look.\"\n\n\"Still going?\" Lawyer An was a bit tired. He wasn't interested in the investigation game, but he couldn't stand his boss's persistent enthusiasm.\n\n\"Let's see it through,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright, let's go.\" A salted fish indeed needs to be flipped occasionally, so the sun can bake it evenly.\n\n...\n\nYang Kewang confessed that he buried the body behind a kiln factory in Guanyinshan Town. He hadn't been to see it in sixteen years. He said that the woman he killed had actually been with him all these sixteen years. He had gotten used to her presence. Of course, such words wouldn't be recorded, perhaps to prevent him from trying to play tricks by feigning mental illness. However, Zhou Ze knew that this guy wasn't intentionally playing tricks.\n\nThe police took Yang Kewang with them. Having the suspect identify and describe the crime scene was an indispensable part of the judicial investigation procedure. Furthermore, Yang Kewang himself needed to provide a specific location at the scene. The kiln factory had long since closed down but was preserved. A few years ago, there were plans for commercial development here, but it was stalled because the developer tried to mix and match commercial and residential land, and the project was temporarily shelved over time. Across from the kiln factory was a small river. Yang Kewang pointed to the river in front of him and said, \"It's about here, right? Anyway, I buried it on the other side of the river. Don't worry, it should be dug up. I even wrapped it in a plastic bag back then.\"\n\nYang Kewang remained calm throughout, as if the entire incident had nothing to do with him. His attitude made one want to go up and slap him, but the man was probably already hoping to die. Whether you hit him or not, it truly made no difference to him; he might even beg you, \"Hit me harder, hit me harder!\"\n\nThe tools were already prepared. Apart from the police officers responsible for maintaining order and preventing onlookers from approaching, the rest of the officers each held a shovel and began to dig! The area Yang Kewang indicated wasn't large, but if you said it wasn't small, digging with just shovels, it wasn't exactly small either.\n\nZhang Yanfeng was originally holding two shovels and was about to find Zhou Ze. However, as he approached Zhou Ze, who was sitting under a tree to cool off, he noticed Zhou Ze looking at him and the extra shovel with a warning in his eyes. After a moment of hesitation, Zhang Yanfeng did not proceed to offer them.\n\nLawyer An was drinking water and fanning himself. \"Boss, I just thought of something.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That is, if you hand over one person's mobile phone to another person to operate, does that mean that most people, even if they die directly, would be difficult to discover?\"\n\n\"Found it!\" a police officer shouted. That was fast. Zhou Ze stood up and walked over, seeing a long object wrapped in a white plastic bag. The forensic examiner stepped forward and used a small knife to cut open the plastic bag, revealing the remains. Immediately, a foul odor assailed their nostrils. Everyone around quickly covered their noses. Zhou Ze and the forensic examiner looked at the remains together, and suddenly, Zhou Ze and the female forensic examiner said in unison, \"This is a male corpse!\" Although the skin and flesh were gone from the remains, professionals could still distinguish between male and female at a glance.\n\nOld Zhang was taken aback. \"Male?\"\n\n\"Report to the captain, I've dug up something here too.\"\n\n\"Report, I have one here too!\"\n\n\"Report, I have one here too.\"\n\n\"I have one here too!\"\n\n\"Captain, I've dug something up here too!\"\n\n\"Report...\"",

    "content": "Zhang Yanfeng was completely dumbfounded,\n\nHe even stumbled back a few steps.\n\nIf he hadn't managed to steady himself, he would have collapsed onto the riverbank.\n\nOf course,\n\nNo one would mock Old Zhang for being unable to handle the situation; anyone would be the same.\n\nIf the top leadership from the bureau saw this, it's possible their hearts would stop, and cardiovascular diseases would collectively flare up.\n\nLooking around,\n\nMore than ten white plastic bags had already been unearthed,\n\nThe reports were endless.\n\nThis wasn't a treasure hunt game where finding one yielded a reward.\n\nWhat was being dug up were landmines!\n\nTongcheng, though located in the Yangtze River Delta region, had economic strength that placed it in the upper-middle tier within Jiangsu Province, but its permanent population was less than three million.\n\nThis was a quiet city. Normally, a single murder case would cause quite a stir.\n\nNow, these ten, no, likely more unexcavated bodies,\n\nWere enough to detonate an atomic bomb above this tranquil city!\n\nThe public outcry would be immense, drawing national attention!\n\nLawyer An smacked his lips. Even with his peculiar hobby of collecting corpse figurines,\n\nUpon seeing this scene,\n\nHe was somewhat shocked and incredulous.\n\nBecause he collected bodies that died naturally, including accidental deaths; as long as he didn't kill them. He was like a dung beetle, collecting his own dung balls.\n\nBut these plastic bags on the riverbank contained lives murdered.\n\nZhou Ze looked back at Yang Kewang, who was being guarded.\n\nWas this a grand gift he was presenting to the police?\n\nBut Yang Kewang's face was filled with astonishment, his body trembling, looking as if he had seen a ghost.\n\n\"How is this possible... How is this possible...\"\n\nYang Kewang kept muttering.\n\nIt wasn't him?\n\nHe didn't kill them?\n\nActually, for Yang Kewang, he already carried the weight of four lives, a sure ticket to execution.\n\nWhile China had switched to lethal injections, the software and hardware requirements for that were too high, the cost too great, and its deterrent effect somewhat weaker. Thus, most places in China still used the \"peanut.\"\n\nWhen you're already responsible for four lives, adding a few more makes little difference. In a civilized society, they wouldn't subject you to dismemberment, and in a lawful society, they wouldn't devise ways to torture you.\n\nIt was like having enough nuclear weapons to destroy the Earth once versus fifty times – there was no fundamental difference.\n\nIn any case, with so many fleas, you wouldn't feel the bites anymore. Why pretend to deny it?\n\n\"Hey, old man!\n\nDid you plant these bodies?\"\n\nLawyer An called out.\n\nSixteen years ago, you planted one body.\n\nSixteen years later,\n\nYou reaped so many bodies.\n\nWith a \"plop,\"\n\nThe old man knelt down, catching the two policemen beside him off guard.\n\n\"It wasn't me who killed them, it wasn't me! You can't wrongly accuse an innocent person! Please, don't wrongly accuse an innocent person!\n\nI only buried one. There's only one here that I buried.\n\nThe others, I don't know, I really don't know!\"\n\nThe old man cried and shouted,\n\nAs if\n\nHe had suffered immense injustice.\n\n...\n\nFirst step: Disperse the nearby onlookers and block the news to ensure the media's \"enchanting sluts\"¹ don't cause trouble.\n\nSecond step: Dispatch more personnel to conduct a thorough excavation of this river channel, unearthing all bodies buried here, ensuring no one is missed.\n\nThird step: Report to the provincial authorities and request assistance from the Provincial Public Security Department to organize a special task force.\n\nThese were the three decisions Old Zhang made. The subsequent events were beyond his control.\n\nThis case had transcended the level that a criminal police captain of a prefecture-level city could manage.\n\nIn the office,\n\nOld Zhang sat blankly in his chair,\n\nHis eyes bloodshot.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand in front of Old Zhang, but he remained unresponsive.\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze was his boss.\n\nSo,\n\nZhou Ze picked up the teacup on the table and splashed all the water onto Old Zhang's face.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nOld Zhang remained unfazed.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and called out to Lawyer An beside him, \"Get the hot water bottle, switch to boiling water.\"\n\nOld Zhang immediately woke up.\n\nWithout yelling or causing a scene,\n\nHe vigorously wiped his face with both hands and exclaimed:\n\n\"Boss, something big has happened.\"\n\n\"Let's eat first,\" Zhou Ze placed the fast-food boxes in front of Old Zhang. Zhou Ze had gone to the police station's cafeteria to get the food just now, and it cost money.\n\nA chicken drumstick, a portion of braised pork, a portion of stir-fried bean sprouts, a portion of braised eggplant, and a bowl of white rice.\n\n2.5 yuan.\n\nThe price moved Zhou Ze to tears.\n\nHe thought he might as well just mooch meals at the police station from now on.\n\nOr perhaps ask Old Zhang to get a large bucket every day after work to bring food back for the people at the bookstore.\n\nWhat belongs to the state belongs to the people. If the people take advantage of the state a little, it's like taking their own things – can that be called stealing?\n\n\"The news has been compiled. Sixteen bodies. Among them, one is the dismembered female corpse from sixteen years ago, which has been found. Because that plastic bag also contained some of the woman's belongings, it was easy to identify. But there are fifteen other bodies, fifteen!\n\nIt's difficult, so difficult...\"\n\nOld Zhang gritted his teeth, looking distressed.\n\nA single unidentified body could keep the entire police department busy for a long time.\n\nNow there were fifteen more.\n\nJust finding their identities was an extremely arduous task.\n\n\"Don't panic. Pick up your chopsticks. You'll find eating is even harder than solving cases,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"...\" Old Zhang.\n\nFor the sake of treating everyone equally,\n\nBoss Zhou did not take his oral liquid this time.\n\nHe ate with difficulty.\n\nLawyer An then spoke, \"Fifteen years, fifteen bodies. This means that after that old man Yang started killing and burying bodies, there might have been another killer who killed one person every year and buried them there. Is this being treated as a mission?\"\n\n\"Yang Kewang's suspicion has not been completely ruled out yet,\" Zhang Yanfeng said, taking a difficult bite of the chicken drumstick, forcing himself not to spit it out and swallowing with difficulty.\n\n\"He denies it, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded.\n\n\"If it weren't for me, he would have already committed suicide. And he probably has a terminal illness and doesn't have much time to live. I don't think he would lie.\n\nMoreover, he would probably wish that all those people were killed and buried by him. According to his philosophy, having so many lingering souls by his side would make him feel warm and cozy, and he would never be lonely or desolate again,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"If you ask me, since one 'dung pot'¹ is going to be placed, why not fifteen? Just push it all onto old Yang. This case will be resolved. You'll save trouble, and Old Yang deserves to die anyway,\" Lawyer An offered his suggestion.\n\nHe had been involved in both the legitimate and illegitimate worlds,\n\nSo, often, for him, there was no right or wrong, only whether the objective was achieved.\n\nThis was a simple and quick way of handling things. It might seem irresponsible, but in fact, it had been repeatedly used throughout history.\n\nWhen someone committed a crime and was discovered, those around them would place all the blame on him, then pat him on the shoulder and say:\n\n\"Your wife, I will raise her!\"¹\n\n\"And then the killer kills another person next year to give you a surprise?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nLawyer An shrugged, \"Then there's nothing that can be done.\"\n\nThis \"dung pot\" couldn't be carelessly placed. Once it was on, if the killer committed more crimes next year, the trouble would be immense, especially since the police had already \"sealed the coffin.\"\n\n\"The identities of the fifteen bodies are under investigation, and no information has been compiled yet,\" Old Zhang swallowed a mouthful of rice. \"Likely, people from the province will be coming down soon to take over this case.\n\nThinking that during my years as a criminal investigator, so many people have died mysteriously, and if not for today's accident, they might not have been discovered until now, I feel like I've been living in a dream and neglecting my duties all these years.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng was a very responsible police officer.\n\n\"It's okay, you've only been in office for a week. It's not your fault,\" Lawyer An consoled him.\n\n\"...\" Old Zhang.\n\nOf course,\n\nThat consolation was useless.\n\n\"Is there a way?\" Old Zhang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Is there a way?\" Zhou Ze looked at Lawyer An.\n\nLawyer An put down his bento box, \"It seems we have to use that trick.\"\n\n\"Mmm...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Mmm...\" Old Zhang.\n\nBecause Lawyer An had previously made the old woman's corpse \"move,\"\n\nEveryone had high hopes for Lawyer An.\n\nIf this case were handled by the book, it would be too slow and time-consuming. If there were an alternative method, it would be the best.\n\nLawyer An straightened his body, twisted his waist, and began to hop and skip, doing warm-up exercises.\n\nZhou Ze and Old Zhang also put down their lunch boxes, watching Lawyer An.\n\nAfter a set of warm-up movements resembling those of elderly people dancing in the square,\n\nLawyer An clasped his hands together and began to form hand seals,\n\nHis expression solemn,\n\nHis demeanor dignified.\n\n\"What is he doing?\" Old Zhang asked.\n\n\"Summoning their lingering souls back to ask them, isn't that obvious?\" Lawyer An smiled. \"Next, I'll show you my signature skills. Pay attention!\n\nWave your glow sticks!!!\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking,\n\nLawyer An completed his hand seals,\n\nSuddenly knelt on one knee,\n\nSlapped the floor with one hand,\n\nWith astonishing speed,\n\nHe shouted:\n\n\"Ninja Art—Summoning Technique!\"¹\n\nAround them,\n\nThere was silence,\n\nSo quiet you could hear a needle drop.\n\nTen seconds later,\n\nSilence.\n\nThirty seconds later,\n\nSilence.\n\nOne minute later,\n\nSilence.\n\nTen minutes later,\n\nStill silence.\n\nAbove their heads, it seemed a mischievous crow flew past the window, cawing weakly:\n\n\"Caw... caw... caw... caw...\"\n\nIn the distance,\n\nFallen leaves were swept up by the wind,\n\nSwirling and flying, then swirling and flying away, desolate.\n\nLawyer An raised his head,\n\nGave Zhou Ze and Old Zhang a look,\n\nSmiled,\n\nReached out and massaged his old back,\n\nStood up,\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"Hey,\n\nYou guys didn't actually believe me, did you?\"",

    "content": "Sixteen new clients checked in, which made the forensic department a bit strained.\n\nForensic doctors from other cities and the provincial level began conducting autopsies together. Any clue or trace would be compiled and reported back, after which a large police force would begin investigating the cases.\n\nThe entire Tongcheng Police Department, and even more than half of the police force in Jiangsu Province, began to be deployed to solve this major case. Before the media completely caught wind of it, they had to seize the time to find some preliminary leads as soon as possible.\n\nAt this critical juncture,\n\nZhou Ze and Lawyer An drove back to the bookstore.\n\nIt was like playing a game. Just as you defeat a BOSS, feeling smug and thinking the game is quite interesting,\n\nSuddenly, you're told\n\nThere are fifteen more BOSSes waiting for you to conquer.\n\nYou'd probably find the game a bit boring.\n\nPerhaps this analogy isn't quite appropriate, but it accurately reflects Boss Zhou's current mindset. He was tired; he had played enough of this detective game and couldn't be bothered to follow up on the more massive conspiracy it entailed.\n\nFlipping a salted fish over is to let both sides catch the sun.\n\nIf you keep flipping back and forth, you'll become dried salted fish.\n\nReturning to the bookstore,\n\nAfter taking a shower\n\nAnd changing clothes, Zhou Ze lay down on the sofa.\n\nBai Yingying brought over a cup of coffee.\n\nZhou Ze immediately perked up, sat up, recognizing the familiar taste and ambiance.\n\n\"You bought it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss,\" Bai Yingying nodded.\n\n\"You went to the trouble.\"\n\nTaking a sip of coffee,\n\nThe familiar civet coffee smell.\n\nAh, blissful.\n\nLawyer An, sitting nearby, also got up and walked behind the bar counter.\n\nZhou Ze's hand holding the cup trembled slightly.\n\nHe recalled the terror of being dominated by Lawyer An's massive thermos that morning when he woke up!\n\n\"Don't worry, Boss. I've hidden your coffee in the bedroom. Below it is the Nestlé instant coffee that was on sale at the supermarket today and is close to its expiration date.\"\n\nBai Yingying said this while glaring fiercely at the counter,\n\nHow dare they snatch the Boss's bone,\n\nOh no,\n\nHow dare they snatch the Boss's coffee! Wicked!\n\nAs Lawyer An walked out,\n\nHe was holding his signature large thermos.\n\nSo big it had no friends.\n\nHe even deliberately shook it in front of Zhou Ze, as if to show off.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to respond.\n\nLawyer An suddenly felt a bit uninspired.\n\nAfter taking a sip,\n\nHe wondered if it was his own psychological state.\n\nThe coffee seemed to have become much blander.\n\nHe took another sip, secretly glancing at Zhou Ze. Seeing that Zhou Ze still had no reaction, Lawyer An simply chugged it down. *Let's see if you care about it!*\n\nAfter he finished his vigorous drinking,\n\nZhou Ze calmly held his cup and slowly savored the coffee.\n\nHe thought to himself, Nestlé instant coffee isn't cheap either, especially since it's treated like water. Next time, he should ask Yingying to specifically collect a few cases of even cheaper expired coffee for Old An to drink.\n\nThe phone rang at this moment. It was Old Zhang's call.\n\nOld Zhang was probably anxious after returning to the office and finding that both the Boss and Lawyer An were gone.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Boss, where did you go?\"\n\n\"Investigating outside. I'll notify you when I have leads.\"\n\n\"Sob sob sob.\"\n\n\"...\" Old Zhang.\n\n\"Oh, I brought Yingying along for the investigation outside.\"\n\n\"...\" Old Zhang.\n\n\"It's like this, Boss. According to the preliminary analysis of the skeletal remains, there's a clear temporal gradient in the time of death for each body. This means that our previous speculation that the killer killed in stages or even one person a year is very likely true.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze yawned.\n\n\"But now there's a problem. The most recent skeleton is also over a year old,\" Old Zhang said anxiously. \"This means the killer hasn't murdered and buried anyone this year. Additionally, there are signs of damage on the bones, with cutting marks generally found on the skeletal remains.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Boss, this case must be expedited. The killer hasn't killed anyone this year. If we don't catch the killer soon, I'm really worried...\"\n\n\"Then you work hard. Don't worry, everyone at the bookstore is always your strongest support!\"\n\nHe was dispensing free motivational speeches.\n\n\"How about this? If I discover anything else, I'll report it to you, Boss.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\"\n\n\"Or, Boss, could you come to the bureau again? We can investigate together?\"\n\n\"Actually, you can find Old Daoist. By the way, where did Old Daoist go?\" Zhou Ze looked at Yingying.\n\n\"He went out this afternoon, looking all eager,\" Bai Yingying said with a sly smile, hinting at where Old Daoist was going.\n\n\"Oh, he went out. Old Zhang, give Old Daoist a call and ask him to accompany you on the investigation. Drive the police to find him, and while you're at it, conduct a raid to purify Tongcheng's cultural environment.\"\n\n\"Find him?\"\n\nLawyer An instinctively felt it was unreliable.\n\n\"Don't worry, he's quite reliable. He's excellent at paving the way.\"\n\n\"You're not kidding me, Boss?\"\n\nOld Zhang had some understanding of Old Daoist's disposition and his actual capabilities.\n\n\"Whoever uses him will know. Don't worry, go contact him.\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't deceiving Old Zhang or trying to fool him. Old Daoist might genuinely possess a certain attribute; he was always the first to trigger unfortunate events around him.\n\nOnce or twice might be coincidence or accident,\n\nBut after numerous times,\n\nIt proves that this guy might just be naturally unlucky.\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze hung up the phone and then moved Old Zhang's number to the blacklist in his contacts.\n\nGetting up,\n\nHe waved at Yingying and said,\n\n\"Take a nap first. We have to be on night duty later. If Old Zhang calls back, don't wake me up.\"\n\n\"Boss, what if Old Zhang comes looking for you?\"\n\n\"Then break his legs and throw him out.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss, Yingying understands!\"\n\n...\n\n\"Achoo!\"\n\nOld Daoist sneezed.\n\nHe reached out and wiped his nose.\n\n\"Hey, big sister, the air conditioning here is too low. It's easy to catch a cold after taking off your clothes.\"\n\nOld Daoist grumbled, pulling a tissue from the bedside table to wipe his nose and some snot.\n\n\"Others lose their clothes in a few moves after I clasp them, and they put them back on as soon as they take them off. Do you think everyone needs to blow the air conditioning for as long as you do?\n\nBrother, to be honest, the money you're spending isn't even enough to cover my air conditioning electricity bill.\"\n\n\"Heh, even though I know it's fake, it's still nice to hear. Alright, I won't delay your business, sis. See you.\"\n\n\"Come again next time!\"\n\n\"Definitely, definitely.\"\n\nOld Daoist walked out of the small room and sneezed again.\n\nDamn it,\n\nDid he actually catch a cold?\n\nThis foot massage parlor was located in the town, not too far from the bookstore. The entrance was a narrow alley, truly a secluded path.\n\nAt the alley entrance sat an old man wearing a blue cap. In front of him was a small table with chess pieces set up for a solved game.\n\nAs the saying goes, after that's over, men enter a state of sainthood.\n\nTheir souls and temperaments are instantly elevated, becoming desireless and refined.\n\nSeeing the solved game, Old Daoist sat on a nearby stool to watch.\n\nThe old man looked at Old Daoist and smiled, \"Want to play a game?\"\n\n\"Let's do it, let's do it!\"\n\nThe two began arranging the chess pieces. Two old men playing chess together, a harmonious scene.\n\nIf you removed the signs above their heads that read \"Foot Massage, Massage, Health, Oil Rub,\"\n\nIt would be even more harmonious.\n\nAt the start, both played quickly. As they entered the middle game, their speed slowed down.\n\n\"Brother, you come here to play?\" the old man asked Old Daoist.\n\nOld Daoist's age was indeed greater than this old man's.\n\n\"Ah, yes. What about you?\"\n\n\"I guard the door, and also keep an eye out.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you, nice to meet you.\"\n\n\"You're too kind, too kind.\"\n\n\"Older brother, is your spouse gone?\" the old man asked.\n\nPeople of their age have already come to terms with life and death.\n\n\"I'm alone.\"\n\n\"What about your children?\"\n\n\"No children.\"\n\n\"Judging by your accent, you're not from around here, are you?\"\n\n\"My hometown is in Shaanxi. I was in Chengdu a couple of years ago, and just came to Tongcheng this year.\"\n\n\"At such an old age, you're still traveling around.\"\n\n\"Precisely because I'm old, I should travel more.\"\n\n\"Makes sense, makes sense. People our age don't have much time left. This year, I've attended several funerals of friends and relatives.\n\nThey're all gone, gone one by one. I'm a bit afraid to answer the phone now, fearing another piece of bad news, that so-and-so has passed away.\n\nMy wife passed away early, and I'm a white-haired person sending off a black-haired person. I don't interact with relatives and friends anymore. The only interaction is at funerals.\"\n\n\"That's where you're wrong.\"\n\n\"How so, older brother?\"\n\n\"Why were you such a good person before, having so many friends? If you ask me, you shouldn't have made friends before, you should have only made enemies.\"\n\n\"Make enemies?\" the old man was bewildered.\n\n\"Yes. When you reach this age,\n\nWhen you answer the phone,\n\nHey,\n\nThat enemy has died,\n\nYou can look forward to surprises every day.\"\n\nThe old man rubbed his head, pondered for a moment, and then laughed heartily, \"It's still older brother who sees things so clearly.\"\n\nThe game finished half an hour later. Old Daoist was slightly superior, he won, but it was a hard-won victory.\n\n\"That was exhilarating, exhilarating!\"\n\nThe old man slapped his thigh and said,\n\n\"I still have some Maotai, and home-boiled salted peanuts. Want to go up and have a little?\"\n\n\"Definitely, definitely!\"\n\nOld Daoist was in a good mood today, and this old man also suited his temperament.\n\nThe two old men linked arms and walked inside together.\n\nIn a small private room inside, the sounds of rocking beds could be heard intermittently.\n\nThe two exchanged a knowing smile,\n\nAs if within the swaying beds,\n\nLay their lost youth.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nIt was already night.\n\nThe lights on the sign at the alley entrance had turned on.\n\nThe red neon sign,\n\nThe words \"Health,\"\n\nBlinding and vibrant,\n\nAs if fresh blood,\n\nWas about to drip out...",

I'm still a little Alzheimer's disease now.\n\n\n\nOne day, I would go out foolishly and get myself out of the way\n\n\n\nYou tell me, if it is on the street, then it would be fine. There are always people watching you, and if something happens, no one dares to help you. At night, someone will call the police and call for a rescue vehicle.\n\n\n\nIf you run to the wilderness, there will be no one who collects the zombies, and you don’t know which wild cat or dog you will be given to you, haha”\n\n\n\n\"Alzheimer's disease\" The old man was stunned for a moment, \"Then you are coming out to do things.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you don't do anything, it's only one day to stay at home, and it's only one day to come out, right?\"\n\n\n\nThe two fucked one cup.\n\n\n\nThe bitterness of the elderly is all rippling in the wine\n\n\n\n\"That's it. It's almost evening anyway. I'll go fry the dishes again. Our brother is here to join us. What do you think?\"\n\n\n\n\"Finish, then I'll wait with my face thick.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man stood up and walked into the kitchen\n\n\n\nThis is a two-bedroom apartment, which is two bedrooms and one living room. The area is only 60 square meters. It is very narrow and the kitchen is even smaller.\n\n\n\n\"You live alone,\" the old Taoist asked\n\n\n\n\"Yes, if you live alone, you have to rent it out. If you live alone, you will be peaceful. Although the place is a little smaller\"\n\n\n\n\"If a person lives, it's not too small. Those young people are floating north and living in the place they live in are really small.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, I heard that I'm going to rent a house recently, which is not easy.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the meeting, the old man walked out and said, \"I'll go to the vegetable garden to pull up some stews in the floor and come back. Brother, you sit here first and then have some wine, wait a moment.\"\n\n\n\n“Thank you hard”\n\n\n\nThe old man walked out of the room and went out\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist went to the sanitary room and happily put a handful of water. After coming out, he pushed open the door of the bedroom and looked at it. There was no bed inside. There was a large ice cabinet.\n\n\n\nJust like the ice cabinet that sells cold drinks in small shops, lying in the corner, and having an electric slug in it\n\n\n\nThe house was clean and clean,\n\n\n\nWhen the old Taoist was convenient, he saw a set of things such as fragrance disinfectants and other items in the bucket.\n\n\n\nThis old man is really a savvy person in life.\n\n\n\nIt's almost as good as the boss of his own obsession\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist remembered that the boss also had an ice cabinet on the second floor of the bookstore in the past, but the ice cabinet of the boss was very scary. It was the ice cabinet that was used to pack dead people.\n\n\n\nFor a long time, the boss has slept there. Of course, because the boss has special quality, he is the only one who can sleep without fear of death.\n\n\n\nIf the old Zhang and Xiao Luli sleep in the ice cabinet, don’t ask them to get up for breakfast the next day. Just prepare them to do the work.\n\n\n\nHowever, the boss later had a baby, and the ice coffin was not moved to the new store on South Street.\n\n\n\nAs for this,\n\n\n\nThe old man also understands it.\n\n\n\nHehe,\n\n\n\n  man\n\n\n\nOpen the door of the second room,\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was stunned for a moment.\n\n\n\nThere was only one roll in the ground.\n\n\n\nThere is no TV, no other thing, so it is so simple that it cannot be simpler\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist touched his chin.\n\n\n\nThis old man has been quite clear and sluggish.\n\n\n\nNo wonder Alzheimer's disease,\n\n\n\n  If I live here, I will have dementia\n\n\n\nThinking about it, the old Taoist suddenly felt that he was surprised by something when he lived in a bookstore every now and then.\n\n\n\nI saw a ghost the day before yesterday, and I saw a hang yesterday.\n\n\n\nSee you again the day after tomorrow.\n\n\n\nOften stimulated,\n\n\n\nIt can also prevent Alzheimer's disease\n\n\n\nClose the doors of the two rooms. The old road walked to the door and looked out. Why did the old man go to pull out a pill? It took so long and he hasn't come back yet.\n\n\n\nAt this time,\n\n\n\nA woman carrying a plastic bag walked up from the entrance of the building below.\n\n\n\nThe layout of this store is like this. The ground floor is a business store, and the foot shop is one of them. There are all residential buildings on the floor.\n\n\n\nThe house of Laotou is on the third floor\n\n\n\n  \"Who are you\"The woman looked at the old Taoist with some confusion\n\n\n\n\"I don't live here and visit my friend's house.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's your friend.\" The woman was a little surprised\n\n\n\n\"Yes, what's wrong?\"\n\n\n\n\"That old man is quite weird. He sits at the entrance of the alley all day and doesn't see him going out much.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are old?\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist expressed his understanding. He knew that he had Alzheimer's disease and was still wandering around. This is how the brain is getting into the water.\n\n\n\n\"Where are others?\" the woman asked\n\n\n\n\"Go down and pull the pills\"\n\n\n\n\"Making food at home\"\n\n\n\n  \"Yes\"\n\n\n\n\"Haha, are you weird or not? I haven't seen him buy food from the door, but he seems to have eaten well. Sometimes when he goes upstairs, he can still hear the meat smell from his house here.\"\n\n\n\n  \"hey-hey\"\n\n\n\nThe woman finished her gossip and went upstairs\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist returned to the house, sat down at the table, and started to eat peanuts\n\n\n\nDuring this period, Zhang Yanfeng sent him a WeChat message, asking him where he was and he wanted to come to find him.\n\n\n\nThis scared the old Taoist trembled.\n\n\n\nHe was not afraid that the boss would arrest him in a big way. By then, he would still have to let the boss come to the police station with five thousand pieces.\n\n\n\nBut the old man doesn't want the old man to run here with a police car, which is not good to scare the sisters below.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the news was seen, and the old Taoist was not in a hurry to reply.\n\n\n\nAfter two sips of wine,\n\n\n\nThe door was pushed open, and the old man came back, holding a handful of pills in his hand\n\n\n\n\"I've been waiting for a long time, I'll go and cook the food and let you cook my handcraft.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man went to the first room. When he came back, he was holding something in his hand, as if it was meat.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist didn't pay attention,\n\n\n\n  Once again, the fragrance of the kitchen is coming from\n\n\n\n  \"Um\"\n\n\n\nThe old man rubbed his hands,\n\n\n\nVery looking forward to it\n\n\n\nAbout half an hour later,\n\n\n\n  A portion of red meat, a portion of fried meat slices, salt-fried meat, and a pelvis of bone soup.\n\n\n\nJust put it on the table\n\n\n\nSeeing a table of meat,\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was stunned for a moment.\n\n\n\n\"Brother, I know now how you have Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\n\n\nEat this oily every day.\n\n\n\nExcept meat, it's meat.\n\n\n\n  Board groove,\n\n\n\nWho are you dementia?\n\n\n\n\"Hehe, when I was a child, I thought about eating meat, but I couldn't eat it\n\n\n\nNow that I have the conditions and I haven't had a good life for many years, I just let my arms go and eat. God knows whether I'm going to lose my money or not, right?\n\n\n\nMao and Xi also said at the beginning that eating red and boiled meat can nourish the kidneys.”\n\n\n\n\"That's right\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist put a piece of meat and ate it\n\n\n\nThe meat is delicious,\n\n\n\n  Fat but not slim,\n\n\n\n(o゜▽゜)o☆\n\n\n\nSo deliciousThe old Taoist eats so much,\n\n\n\n  Big Fast,\n\n\n\nNo need to eat, no food is cooked, just eat meat.\n\n\n\nFinally, I drank three large bowls of pork soup.\n\n\n\nI just feel that I am incomparable\n\n\n\nPasted my stomach,\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist said with emotion:\n\n\n\n\"It's so good, comfortable, happy\"\n\n\n\nThe old man picked up the wine glass and touched the old Taoist for a while. The two of them drank in one go, and he finished eating too.\n\n\n\n\"Brother, it's a pity that you don't go out to be a chef. The chef in my company is not as good as you.\"\n\n\n\n\"One, brother, you still open a company.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man was a little surprised and asked immediately\n\n\n\n\"Yes, it's the company, the store is on South Street\"\n\n\n\n\"South Street, that's amazing,\" the old man exclaimed in surprise\n\n\n\nIn the authentic Tongcheng people's eyes, South Street is the most prosperous land in the city center of Tongcheng. Where you can open a store, the rent is scary.\n\n\n\n\"No money, nothing, there are all people who are not human or ghosts, so worrying.\"\n\n\n\n\"Haha, right, the business is not easy to do now, and it is not easy to find employees who are actually working in Bali.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's right, the employees in the store are getting closer and closer. If I don't look at it or whip it behind me, they will dare to silence the sun and drink tea every day under my nose.\n\n\n\nI am such a boss, it's really hard.\"\n\n\n\n\"For your subordinates, you have to teach them well and set up rules.\"\n\n\n\n  \"you do not say\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not easy. I heard you have nothing to do before, but I actually opened a company. I didn't expect that, I didn't expect that you were also interesting, so why did you come here to consume\n\n\n\nBased on your income, you shouldn't come here.\n\n\n\nAs soon as there is something happening, the employees in your store must be anxious to death.”\n\n\n\n\"Whoever calls me this way. The girls in the institute are really young, but I can't start. All of them are my Santa's age, and even the Santa's old girl can do it, but I can't start it.\n\n\n\n  and,\n\n\n\nWe are in this year, how many movements and needs do you think there are?\n\n\n\nI just want to find comfort.\n\n\n\nFind someone who is yours, talk, chat, do you think you are?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's this principle\"\n\n\n\n Old point points,\n\n\n\nI silently sighed,\n\n\n\nExpression,\n\n\n\nSome disappointment",

    "content": "Xiao Luoli opened the door, looked in, and saw Zhou Ze and Bai Baozi were on the bed\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was lying there and sleeping soundly. Bai Bao Bao was holding the book \"The Self-Study of a Maid\", which seemed to be endless, and continued to read.\n\n\n\n\"Empress,\n\n\n\nThe pig's hooves are asleep.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli shouted in a low voice\n\n\n\nBai Baoli put down the book in her hand and glanced at Xiao Li standing at the door, but she still smiled at the corner of her mouth:\n\n\n\n\"Sister Lin,\n\n\n\nMaster just fell asleep.”\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli walked in, took a look at Zhou Ze first, and confirmed that he was really sleeping. Then she fell to Bai Baobao's body and continued to whisper:\n\n\n\n\"Sister, can you help me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Look at what my sister said,\n\n\n\nEveryone is the master's woman.\n\n\n\nYour business is mine...\"\n\n\n\nWhite baobao couldn't help but bit his lip, and couldn't help but want to laugh\n\n\n\nXiao Luli snatched her shoulders, took Bai Baobao's hand, and said, \"There is something I need to help you.\"\n\n\n\n\"You tell me\"\n\n\n\n\"The day after tomorrow, I have a ghost mess I know about. He seems to be in trouble and needs me to answer him when he passes through Tongcheng.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Um\" \n\n\n\nBai Baobao was a little confused. Although his boss was very careful about these \"welcoming and seeing off\" things, if Xiao Luoli took the initiative to talk to Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze would definitely agree.\n\n\n\nEven if the boss himself is ready to come forward, he will send someone from the bookstore to accompany Xiao Luoli to come forward.\n\n\n\nIn other words, Xiao Luli doesn't need to come and ask for her secretly\n\n\n\n\"That person had chased and killed the old Taoist and the woman named Tang at the beginning.\"\n\n\n\nThe white jean showed a clear look,\n\n\n\n  so,\n\n\n\nThis is not something that anyone else in the bookstore knows.\n\n\n\nBao Bao knew that although his boss and the person in Rongcheng had no relationship, there was a passion between them. The woman named Tang came back to help after going to Shanghai.\n\n\n\nAs for the old Taoist, let alone, if he knew that the ghost messenger Xiao Luoli was planning to help had been chased and killed by him.\n\n\n\nOld man,\n\n\n\nThe old man must...\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist is sure that he doesn't dare to go, but he will never stop picking up Boss Zhou and then savoring the delicious taste of the tender ghost\n\n\n\nTherefore, Xiao Luoli can only ask for the white jewel\n\n\n\nOld man is not strong enough. Besides Zhou Cheng, Lao An is also helpless, and he is the only one left.\n\n\n\n\"Trouble,\" Bai Baobao asked\n\n\n\n\"If it's too irritating, we'll just let it go,\" Xiao Su said of course\n\n\n\nThe implication is that if you can help, if you can, you can sell.\n\n\n\n\"Yes\" the white jeans point the head, which is considered an answer\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli was very happy, and then took the initiative to remove clothes and prepare them and drank them into the quilt to feel. As a result, Bai Baoli reached out and pushed them down.\"Um\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli pouted,\n\n\n\nVery unhappy\n\n\n\n\"Go to take a shower, don't take a shower, don't go to bed, the boss doesn't like it.\"\n\n\n\n\"The big pig's hooves with a habit are the most annoying.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli ran out in a bulging manner.\n\n\n\nAfter twenty minutes,\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli, who had changed into pajamas, hair and a little trendy, walked back again. She put her hands in front of Bai Baoli and said:\n\n\n\n\"I've washed myself out.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking,\n\n\n\nShe finally got into the censor\n\n\n\nHowever, as I saw that Xiao Luli was still sleeping next to Bai Baobao and did not go to Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nBai Bao Bao continued to read the book,\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli turned her head, looked at the cover of the book, and said, \"Look at this useless.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Um\" \n\n\n\n\"No matter how rich theoretical knowledge is, it is not as strong as the battle, and it is still much more practical.\"\n\n\n\n\"Real\"\n\n\n\n\"Men are all big pig's hooves, and they can't control themselves, as long as you have to flirt with them.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli looked like a passing tone.\n\n\n\nOK,\n\n\n\n  When it comes to men and women, Xiao Luli is indeed a past person\n\n\n\nIt’s a pity that her body is too small, and she has to think about the original owner of this body, and it is impossible for her to let herself go.\n\n\n\nIf she had entered a young and a woman's body at the beginning, Xiao Luli would have been excited long ago\n\n\n\nBai Baobao thought about it for a long time before he understood what Xiao Luoli meant\n\n\n\n\"Single\"\n\n\n\nBut there is ice underneath it.”\n\n\n\n\"You are stupid, your mouth is frozen\n\n\n\nYour hands are ice\n\n\n\nHere you,\n\n\n\nHere you,\n\n\n\nYou're all frozen here.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli stood up and stopped sleeping. It was probably because Bai Baobao just asked her to help her, so at this time she did not \"stupid\" but began to become a guide to sex education.\n\n\n\nMrs. Bai was sure to have a secret relationship with the book student at first, but the book student was not good at character and spread rumors after he failed to get pregnant, which led to Mrs. Bai's death by her family to preserve her reputation.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Bao Bao doesn't understand this.\n\n\n\nIn ancient times, before a woman got married, there would be an old lady at home holding a picture of the Spring Palace to teach classes, asking you to do whatever she wants\n\n\n\nJust as the teaching between teachers and disciples was in full swing,\n\n\n\nBoss Zhou, who was sleeping soundly, sensed the movement of the bed.\n\n\n\n  I opened my eyes in a daze,\n\n\n\nHe saw the fragrance and sweating profusely.\n\n\n\nI saw Zhu Shiling,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought in a daze,\n\n\n\nThis dream is great,\n\n\n\nIt’s much better than a day trip to the locals without moving.\n\n\n\nTurned over,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze has fallen asleep again…………………\n\n\n\n Wine for friends for a few thousand cups, but when you are old, you can’t drink too much\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist heard his boss that in the past, many people who went to the hospital for rescue due to alcohol poisoning were killed or even failed to rescue him.\n\n\n\nBecause many people experience acute alcohol poisoning, the people next to them think they are just drinking too much and need a rest, which often makes them miss the time to rescue them. When they really find that they are not sent to the hospital, they will no longer be beating.\n\n\n\nThe old man was cleaning up the dishes, and the old man planned to help, but the old man said he didn't need it.\n\n\n\n\"Then I'll leave.\"\n\n\n\nIt’s getting late, I’ve eaten the evening meal, I have to tell you\n\n\n\n\"It's hard to walk on the night road, be careful,\" the old man reminded\n\n\n\n\"Haha, I'm afraid of seeing ghosts\"\n\n\n\n\"Scared, of course I'm afraid\"\n\n\n\n\"What's the point of fearing ghosts?\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist swears his hands and leaves the door\n\n\n\nAs the saying goes, \"Yuanhuo is so warm.\" When the old Taoist got off the building and passed the alley again, he saw the big girl sitting at the door, wearing a sweater in her hand.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist twisted his waist, did some self-examination, thought about it, but still left\n\n\n\nI'm talking about being crazy about the boy,\n\n\n\nA pear blossom and begonia\n\n\n\nThe kidneys are sometimes overly exhausted\n\n\n\nOf course, this is not the most embarrassing thing.\n\n\n\nThe most embarrassing thing is,\n\n\n\nWhen the old Taoist is preparing to register WeChat or pay the payment,\n\n\n\nAs soon as you touch your pocket,\n\n\n\nI found out that my phone was not on my body\n\n\n\nFortunately, this big girl is a sensible person.\n\n\n\nAlthough the old Taoist does not have the ability to prostitution and prostitution for free, \"Yang Liu'an Xiaoyan Yue\" Liu Yong,\n\n\n\nBut he is also considered a friend of middle-aged and elderly women.\n\n\n\nPeople don’t think that the old Taoist wants to play the overlord and the chicken.\n\n\n\nEven thoughtfully said that it would be fine without paying money\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist thought for a while and thought that his cell phone should have been drinking too much with the old man on the floor, so he put his hands on the table, and forgot to bring it on when he came out.\n\n\n\nAfter calming the big girl, she asked him to wait for him, and the old Taoist immediately went up the building again \"rubbed\"\n\n\n\nIt's OK, it's pushed\n\n\n\nThe lights are closed in the room.\n\n\n\n A piece of darkness\n\n\n\n\"Hey, brother, my phone has fallen here. I'm here to get the phone, are you there?\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist stood at the door and shouted, but no one responded\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist simply touched and opened the door by himself.\n\n\n\nBut the lights are not illuminated when the switch is turned on.\n\n\n\nThe lights are bubbled\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist fumbled to the table, looked for it for a long time, and touched his cell phone\n\n\n\nThank you, the mobile phone is still here, so you can go down and pay the big girl;\n\n\n\nIt’s not easy for big girls.\n\n\n\nYou can't eat it yourself\n\n\n\nHe turned on the flashlight of his mobile phone, looked at it, and went to another location to open the light, and found that the light was not lit either.The door jumped at home\n\n\n\nBut where did that brother go\n\n\n\nThe doors are not closed in the middle of the night, and people are not at home\n\n\n\nHe said he had Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n\nDon’t drink too much with your own brother, and you’re sick and run out.\n\n\n\nWhat accident happened?\n\n\n\nThe old man really won't be willing to go with his conscience\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist first went to the kitchen and took a look, then went to the sanitation room, but there was no one\n\n\n\nPush the door of the bedroom,\n\n\n\nI illuminated it with a flashlight.\n\n\n\nThere is only one squid inside, but no one is there\n\n\n\n\"No, people really ran out.\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist touched his head, feeling a little worried\n\n\n\nHe subconsciously opened the door of the second room.\n\n\n\nThere is only one ice cabinet inside.\n\n\n\nNothing else,\n\n\n\nNo one, either\n\n\n\nNot here either,\n\n\n\nIt seems that I'm really out\n\n\n\nJust when the old man was about to go out to find someone,\n\n\n\nSuddenly hesitated for a moment,\n\n\n\nLook at the ice cabinet again,\n\n\n\nHow do you feel?\n\n\n\nThe ice cabinet seemed to have been moved\n\n\n\nNot very sure, but I just feel this way\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist walked in and looked in with his mobile phone and flashlight.\n\n\n\nThe shadow of the old Taoist is reflected on the wall.\n\n\n\nVery long,\n\n\n\nVery high,\n\n\n\nLike black paint, it was rolled on the wall\n\n\n\nThe ice cabinet is in the spotlight, but the old Taoist remembered that when he looked at it, the ice cabinet was placed on the side, and this time it was placed on the spot.\n\n\n\n  Extend your hand,\n\n\n\nPull the cover of the ice cabinet\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist's hand shook violently.\n\n\n\nAlmost screamed out,\n\n\n\n  Meat,\n\n\n\nAll meat,\n\n\n\nMeat filled with ice crock\n\n\n\nExtremely large amount of meat\n\n\n\nBut soon,\n\n\n\nLao Dao found that the whole place was full of chicken, duck, beef, ham, etc., all of them were normal meat.\n\n\n\nA shocking moment,\n\n\n\nHuh,\n\n\n\nIt seems that\n\n\n\nI was brought up by that David.\n\n\n\nThis old man is really good. He knows that you love to eat meat, but you don’t have to store so much meat.\n\n\n\nI was afraid that I would get lost when I ran out to buy things, so I simply bought a lot of them and hid them once.\n\n\n\nThis reason seems to make sense.\n\n\n\nFor that old man,\n\n\n\nEvery time I go out, I look like I go to the ghost gate for a walk\n\n\n\n  \"Um\"\n\n\n\nWhat is thisThe old Taoist reached out, shining the ice cabinet with a flashlight, and moving the cold chicken beef on it with his hands.\n\n\n\nAfter moving,\n\n\n\nWhen I saw this scene below,\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist's pupils instantly contracted.\n\n\n\nMy body suddenly stiffened,\n\n\n\nThe mobile phone also fell into the ice cabinet.\n\n\n\n  A moment,\n\n\n\nThe entire room,\n\n\n\n A piece of darkness\n\n\n\n\"Mom\"\n\n\n\nTen seconds later,\n\n\n\nIn the entire apartment building,\n\n\n\nThe response started to the old Taoist's cry",

    "content": "\"Why is this coffee getting stranger the more I drink it? Have I just gotten tired of it?\"\n\nDownstairs in the bookstore, Lawyer An was still examining the coffee in his hands. The large thermos bottle was full.\n\n\"Could it be that the Boss suddenly doesn't mind me drinking this, and so the coffee has lost its flavor for me?\"\n\nLawyer An normally didn't drink coffee. In his previous life, he preferred tea. Now that he had become this \"state,\" he couldn't sleep anyway, so drinking coffee was just stirring himself up? Only some salted fish, who had no trouble sleeping, drank this every day.\n\nHowever, the specific reason was actually very simple: Lawyer An had never drunk so-called instant coffee before. He had always been someone who pursued refinement in life. Because of this, even after Bai Yingying changed the coffee, he still couldn't tell the difference.\n\nA police car stopped in front of the bookstore. The screech of its brakes was utterly unbearable. Lawyer An suddenly stood up and saw Old Zhang rushing in.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Lawyer An asked. Although he looked down on Old Zhang's abilities, even now he thought the Boss making Old Zhang one of the five ghost generals was an emotional and unprofitable deal. But he still approved of Old Zhang's character and acknowledged his composure. He hadn't even panicked like this when he sacrificed himself.\n\n\"Something happened!\" Old Zhang shouted. \"Where's the Boss?\"\n\nLawyer An poked his head and said, \"Taking a nap.\"\n\nOld Zhang immediately rushed up the stairs, his footsteps echoing \"deng deng deng.\" Lawyer An shook his head, pondering what could have happened to make him so anxious.\n\n\"Knock knock knock! Knock knock knock!\"\n\nBai Yingying glanced at the Boss and the little loli sleeping beside her. She got up and walked to the door, opening it. What greeted her was a very anxious Old Zhang.\n\n\"Why isn't the Boss answering the phone? The first call, he was out of service area; the second call, his phone was turned off; the third call, it was suspended due to non-payment!\"\n\n\"This...\" Bai Yingying didn't know how to explain, because she knew that with Old Zhang's experience as a criminal investigator, he couldn't possibly guess that Zhou Ze had put him on the blacklist.\n\n\"Hurry and call the Boss, something has happened.\"\n\n\"No, the Boss ordered that no one is allowed to disturb him while he's sleeping!\" Bai Yingying said resolutely.\n\n\"Hurry and call him, something has really happened, you must call him!\" As he spoke, Old Zhang directly walked inside, intending to pull Zhou Ze out of bed.\n\nHowever, in the next moment, the one who was lifted up was Zhang Yanfeng himself. Zhang Yanfeng's feet dangled, shaking incessantly, but his collar was held by Bai Yingying as she lifted him.\n\n\"The Boss hates it the most when people disturb his rest. No matter how big the matter, you're not allowed to wake him up!\"\n\nOld Zhang was both angry and anxious. He wanted to resist, but where was he Bai Yingying's match? He was already a rather weak ghost general. Because his soul hadn't experienced the stimulation of hell, he was the weakest among the ghost generals. It was really easy for the female zombie to deal with him. Even with his criminal investigation grappling skills, he could only handle ordinary criminals, but dealing with a violent zombie maid? It was unrealistic.\n\nOf course, this was also because Old Zhang had dug too many pits for himself before. He would call Zhou Ze to help him investigate cases every now and then. Boss Zhou's lazy nature had long been dissatisfied with this. Once or twice was fine, but after too many times, Boss Zhou got fed up.\n\n\"Old Dao has been apprehended, he's been arrested!\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Bai Yingying was stunned for a moment. She looked at Zhou Ze, still sleeping on the bed, then thought of Old Dao. After considering, she said, \"If he's arrested, then he's arrested. The Boss sleeping is more important.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"...\" Old Dao, who was not present.\n\nZhang Yanfeng felt he couldn't communicate with this female zombie at all. At this moment, he simply let out a loud shout, \"Something's happened!!!!\"\n\nThe little loli sat up from the bed, staring at Old Zhang with great displeasure. This last sister to join was too ill-mannered!\n\nZhou Ze also frowned and opened his eyes, slowly sitting up.\n\n\"Another case?\" Zhou Ze looked at Old Zhang, who was being held by Yingying, and asked with some impatience.\n\n\"Old Dao was mistaken for the murderer and was captured by the task force. The situation is very urgent now, and the task force has listed him as the prime suspect!\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened, and he looked at Old Zhang with some confusion.\n\n\"You're not joking, are you?\" He was notorious for being missing while soliciting prostitutes, and this Old Dao went out to solicit prostitutes and directly became a murderer?\n\n\"I'm not joking, and what's more, a lot of evidence is pointing towards him. Even I don't know where all this evidence came from! Not only the latest case, but Old Dao was at the scene, his fingerprints are on the murder weapon, there's surveillance footage, and even clues investigated from previous victims actually point to Old Dao.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat by the bed and asked Old Zhang, \"Were you at the scene when they made the arrest?\"\n\nOld Zhang was stunned for a moment.\n\n\"Useless.\"\n\n\"...\" Old Zhang.\n\n...\n\nIn the car, Old Zhang was driving, while Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat with a detached expression. In the back sat Bai Yingying and the little loli. Lawyer An drove his own car, with the little monkey following behind. Only Xu Qinglang and the dead servants were left to guard the bookstore.\n\n\"Don't be impulsive,\" Zhang Yanfeng said after a moment of hesitation.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Old Zhang and said, \"I don't know the details of the case, and I'm not clear about the scene. I'll only ask you one question: do you think Old Dao could be the murderer?\"\n\n\"I don't believe he's the murderer, but...\"\n\n\"Then there are no buts.\" Zhou Ze interrupted Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"The problem now is that a lot of evidence inexplicably points to him. We must investigate this matter thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Investigate, of course, we must investigate. However, regardless of whether anything is discovered in the end, I will not stand by and watch Old Dao take the blame.\"\n\n\"Things won't reach that point.\"\n\n\"I hope they won't reach that point either.\"\n\nSince Old Zhang was driving a police car, the vehicle entered the police station unimpeded. After getting out of the car, Zhou Ze signaled Bai Yingying and the little loli to wait in the car, and he himself followed Old Zhang into the police station.\n\nWatching the backs of the two disappear into the lobby, the little loli nudged Bai Yingying's waist with her elbow.\n\n\"It's quite rare to see our Boss looking so serious and solemn.\"\n\nA salted fish suddenly stood up straight, and this incongruity was indeed surprising.\n\n\"The Boss said he just hopes everyone is safe and sound,\" Bai Yingying didn't feel anything strange about it. \"The Boss knows what he should do.\"\n\nLawyer An, who had parked his car in front of the police station in the distance, reached out and held the constantly agitated, jumping monkey. The monkey squeaked \"zhi zhi zhi,\" ceaselessly waving the plastic toy hammer in its hand, looking as if it was going to break into prison! Old Dao had been to the police station before, for unlicensed driving, or even dealing in illegal substances, but the monkey knew that this time, it was different, very different.\n\n\"Don't worry, don't worry, it'll be fine, it'll be fine,\" Lawyer An was quite calm. \"Let's see how things develop first. Come, let Uncle check you for lice.\"\n\n...\n\nOld Zhang walked in front, his face grim. Zhou Ze walked behind him, his face even grimmer. The two walked one after another in the police station corridors, exuding an aura that warned people away.\n\n\"Boss, please don't be impulsive. This is the police station, and you also said that we ghost generals cannot act recklessly in the mortal realm's institutions.\"\n\n\"Old Zhang, I'll say the ugly words first.\"\n\n\"You say.\"\n\n\"I allow you to continue to waver between your identities as a ghost general and a criminal investigator, but at this time, I demand that you consider yourself a ghost general.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"No, you don't know.\" Zhou Ze reached out and placed his hand on Old Zhang's shoulder, saying in a deep voice, \"Old Dao could not have killed anyone.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so too.\"\n\n\"So, this matter is very simple. Either someone is deliberately trying to frame him, or someone is trying to use framing him as a way to frame me!\" Zhou Ze gritted his teeth. Although he didn't know the full situation behind this matter, he instinctively sensed a sense of crisis.\n\n\"If someone is trying to frame me, then my ghost generals, the people in the bookstore, including you, will not be spared. I'm not you. I'm a selfish person, and I won't willingly sacrifice myself. You understand this.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Captain, that prisoner just finished being interrogated and is about to be escorted to the detention center.\"\n\n\"Bring him out again, I still have a few things to ask.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain.\"\n\nZhou Ze and Old Zhang entered the interrogation room together. This was against regulations, very against regulations. It could be seen that at this time, Old Zhang had indeed facilitated many conveniences. He was not someone who didn't know how to adapt. As long as it didn't endanger society or involve fundamental principled errors, he understood the concept of adapting to local conditions.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes, his left hand spinning a pen. Had it only been peaceful for a while, and now something else was coming to bother him? After the lesson from Xu Qinglang's master suddenly appearing last time and almost slaughtering everyone in the bookstore, Zhou Ze was now extremely sensitive to such matters. It was just that, at present, he helplessly did not understand whether this incident was targeting Old Dao himself or targeting him, Zhou Ze.\n\nIf it was the former, then the problem could be contained and resolved. If it was the latter... Zhou Ze took a deep breath, the speed of his spinning pen also accelerating. He remembered that when the \"Sha Bi\" sealed that consciousness within his body, that consciousness had roared, saying it would wait and see how long it would take before he personally had to unseal it and seek its power. His thoughts were racing.\n\nOld Dao was escorted in by the police officers and sat on the interrogation chair, handcuffed. Zhou Ze slowly opened his eyes, and then he was startled by Old Dao's current disheveled state and his hazy eyes! The pen in his hand instantly stopped spinning, and Zhou Ze's body slowly leaned forward. Old Dao, how could he have ended up like this!",

    "content": "The old Taoist was an optimist,\na dare-to-die type,\na trip-the-wire type,\na feeler-out type,\na salted egg yolk type.\nHe was seventy-one years old, and in his life, he had experienced countless storms and upheavals. Even if he hadn't seen ghost messengers, hadn't seen ghosts, and hadn't been baptized by supernatural phenomena,\nat this moment,\nhe shouldn't have been like this.\nHis expression was vacant,\nhis gaze was clouded,\nhis topknot and beard were disheveled,\nand the whole person looked like his soul had been snatched away.\nZhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng.\nBoss Zhou needed an explanation. He could let the old Taoist take a joyride in a wheelchair that sang nursery rhymes, but he wouldn't allow anyone to tamper with him.\n\"You've misunderstood. When we found him at the scene, he was sitting by the door, holding a knife, looking exactly like this.\nThere's no mistreatment or coercion in the police station. You can rest assured about that.\"\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\"This is the previous statement. Take a look.\"\nOld Zhang handed the statement to Zhou Ze and continued:\n\"During the interrogation, when the police asked questions, he answered and cooperated very well, basically clarifying the case.\nThe deceased was an old man who lived there, aged 65. His body was found in a freezer, with a lot of flesh and skin cut off.\nWe also found leftover cooked food in the kitchen trash can. After testing, it was confirmed to be human meat, and it was from the deceased's body.\"\nZhou Ze flipped through the statement.\nIn the statement,\nthe old Taoist described the entire process of his crime, including how he killed, how he handled the body, how he cooked, and a series of other things. He provided a detailed account, even mentioning what kind of wine he drank while eating.\n\"Did he say this himself?\" Zhou Ze asked, holding the statement.\nOld Zhang nodded.\nZhou Ze threw the statement book onto the table, leaned forward slightly, looked at the old Taoist, and called out softly:\n\"Old Taoist, do you remember who I am?\"\nThe old Taoist raised his head,\nlooked left,\nlooked right,\nthen looked up,\nthen looked down,\nfinally grinning,\nand said:\n\"You are the boss.\"\nAs he spoke, drool dripped from the corner of the old Taoist's mouth.\n\"He's mentally unstable,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\"The higher-ups believe he's trying to get away with this by feigning insanity.\"\n\"If he wanted to get away with it, why would he have provided such a detailed account of the crime?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\"I don't know either,\" Old Zhang took a deep breath and said, \"That's why I was so eager to come back to find you. I feel like there's something unusual about the old Taoist.\"\nUpon hearing this,\nZhou Ze closed his eyes,\ntapping his fingers lightly on the tabletop.\n\"Can you turn off the camera?\" Zhou Ze opened his eyes and looked at the camera above.\n\"No, I'm not managing this case right now, and I don't have much room to operate. If the camera is turned off, the special investigation team will come over immediately.\"\nThe old Taoist continued to sit in a daze.\nAt this moment,\nhe truly looked like a seventy-something-year-old man,\na seventy-something-year-old man with dementia.\n\"Old Taoist, what exactly happened? Who did you meet? Tell me,\" Zhou Ze spoke again.\nAt the same time,\nunder the table,\nZhou Ze's fingers clenched.\nWhich bastard was it that turned the old Taoist into this state!\n\"Hm?\" The old Taoist looked up in confusion, smiled, and said sincerely, \"I killed someone, I ate someone, I broke the law.\nI want to eat peanuts.\nI like peanuts the most.\nPeanuts are so delicious.\"\nZhou Ze stared intently at the old Taoist's eyes but couldn't discern anything from them.\nOne thing was certain:\nthe old Taoist didn't kill anyone.\nIf he had killed someone, he wouldn't have dared to pretend to be crazy in front of him, because the old Taoist knew that even if he \"ate peanuts\" (was executed), he would still have to report to Zhou Ze in the end!\nZhou Ze immediately made a decision and said:\n\"Arrange for Old An to meet with the old Taoist.\"\nWhen it came to mental aspects, such as hypnosis or illusions, Zhou Ze was good at resisting them but not at utilizing or understanding them.\nGiven the old Taoist's current state,\nonly Lawyer An could handle this.\n\"It's a bit difficult,\" Old Zhang said.\n\"Old Zhang,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"He's a living person,\" Zhou Ze pointed at the old Taoist. \"In the bookstore, there are many beings that are neither human nor ghost, but the old Taoist is a living person.\"\n\"I know.\"\n\"He's a citizen in your eyes.\"\n\"I know that too.\"\n\"I'm not going to talk about his identity. Just consider yourself as you were before. If you knew a good person was about to be framed and take the blame, what would you, a police officer with a sense of justice and responsibility, do?\"\n\"Boss, you don't need to say this to me,\" Old Zhang said with a wry smile. \"I know what I should do. What I'm hesitating about is that bringing you here already violates discipline. I can use your consultant status to prevent the special investigation team from saying anything.\nBut if I bring Old An over, I might be isolated by the special investigation team. By then, my position won't be able to help you much.\"\n\"Bringing Lawyer An to see him is beyond the scope of what you police officers can handle.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nSince the boss had decided, Old Zhang didn't say any more.\n...\nA quarter of an hour later, Lawyer An entered the interrogation room.\nZhang Yanfeng stood at the door of the interrogation room, keeping watch. They would be discovered soon, and they wouldn't have much time.\nLawyer An glanced at the old Taoist upon entering. At first, he smiled, but then his smile gradually faded, replaced by a look of seriousness.\nHe sat down,\nand Lawyer An waved his hand in front of the old Taoist,\n\"Do you recognize me?\"\nThe old Taoist nodded and said, \"The horny lawyer.\"\nLawyer An frowned.\n\"Was he hypnotized or under an illusion spell?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\"He was hypnotized,\" Lawyer An replied.\n\"Can it be undone now?\" Zhou Ze pointed at the copy of the statement on the table and said, \"If it's not undone soon, he'll make this case a done deal.\"\nLawyer An placed his hands on the desk and interlaced them, \"He recognizes you too, right?\"\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\"Generally speaking, hypnosis affects a person's judgment by altering their subconscious. This is an advanced technique. A low-level technique is to use overlaying to replace the original personality and thinking with a new one.\nFor example,\nhypnotizing someone into a chicken.\nBut his thinking is clear now, and he can recognize me and you. However, he's still confessing to the crime...\"\nLawyer An opened the statement book and read it a few times.\n\"This proves that the hypnotist is very skilled.\"\n\"Is it a person or a ghost?\" Zhou Ze urgently wanted to know.\n\"It's hard to say. It's likely not human, but it could be human too. Some skilled people have incredible hypnosis methods.\nIt's hard to judge right now.\nI'll try to see if I can help him break free from the hypnosis.\"\nLawyer An, who always liked to show off,\nspoke so humbly this time,\neven using words like \"try,\"\nwhich showed how serious the situation was,\neven exceeding Zhou Ze's initial estimation.\nLawyer An lowered his arm and hid his left hand in his sleeve. This was the police station, after all, and there were cameras. He had to be careful about what he did.\nThe flesh on his left hand slowly receded, revealing the bone structure underneath.\nInvisible pink mist began to diffuse,\nslowly enveloping the old Taoist and entering his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.\nThe old Taoist, who had been in a daze, suddenly froze,\nand then sat up straight,\nhis mouth agape,\nhis eyes closed.\nLawyer An also slowly closed his eyes,\nand called out:\n\"Old Taoist, open your eyes...\"\n...\n\"Old Taoist, open your eyes!\"\nLawyer An also opened his eyes.\nHe was in darkness,\nbut soon, everything around him began to slowly appear.\nIn a narrow corridor,\nwith mottled walls all around.\nLawyer An frowned. Usually, when he hypnotized people, he liked to set the scene in a private room at a club because it made people feel comfortable and relaxed. Of course, some hypnotists liked to set the scene on a beach. It just depended on personal preference.\nHowever, this time,\nthe scene was not designed by him,\nwhich meant that\nthe person who had tampered with the old Taoist was very powerful, so powerful that Lawyer An couldn't pull the old Taoist's consciousness out.\nThere was a door in front of him.\nLawyer An pushed open the door.\nHe saw the old Taoist curled up in the corner,\nhis body trembling uncontrollably.\nHis face was pale,\nhe was breathing out white mist, shivering.\n\"Old Taoist, Old Taoist!\"\nLawyer An called out.\nBut the old Taoist completely ignored him, just continuing to curl up there.\nNext,\nLawyer An saw another old Taoist sitting by the dining table in the living room. That old Taoist was drinking wine and eating food, chatting happily with someone who wasn't there, talking and laughing.\nAnd in the kitchen,\nthe old Taoist was wearing an apron,\nstir-frying food,\nwith the aroma of meat filling the air.\nLawyer An walked further in and opened a room door.\nInside,\nhe saw the old Taoist standing by the freezer, knife in hand, cutting something while muttering to himself:\n\"This piece is too lean, this piece is too fatty, this piece is still good...\"\nLawyer An continued to walk in and reached the freezer.\nHe looked down and found that lying in the freezer was also the old Taoist.\n\"Old Taoist, can you wake up?\"\nLawyer An called out.\nHonestly,\nLawyer An was a little panicked now.\nThis kind of hypnosis technique,\nit was the first time he had seen it.\nThe old Taoist standing by the freezer with the knife suddenly looked at Lawyer An beside him and made a \"shush\" gesture.\nHe said nervously:\n\"Shh, be quiet, it's watching.\"\n\"Who's watching?\" Lawyer An asked.\nThe old Taoist pointed to the ceiling.\nLawyer An looked up,\nand saw that on the ceiling above the room,\nwere densely packed eyes.\nThis was a sight that could make someone with trypophobia collapse.\nIn here,\nmost of the eyes were closed, as if pretending to sleep;\nonly a few eyes\nwere half-open.",

    "content": "Outside the interrogation room, a group of people arrived, and it suddenly became noisy outside.\n\nZhou Ze heard Old Zhang's voice, seemingly explaining something, but just as one regrets not having enough books when needed, a subordinate regrets their limited authority.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe interrogation room door was pushed open.\n\nOld Zhang stood at the doorway, looking at Zhou Ze with some helplessness.\n\nRuling out the option of using force, Old Zhang had already stalled for as long as possible.\n\nZhou Ze was about to get up when his hand was grabbed by Lawyer An, who was still sitting with his eyes closed. Lawyer An said in a deep voice,\n\n\"Help me up and leave. He, stays.\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the still dazed Old Daoist, helped Lawyer An up, and walked out.\n\nUpon reaching the parking lot outside, Zhou Ze let go of Lawyer An, who then leaned against the car window, gasping for breath. Bloodstains were dripping from the corner of his eye, making him look incredibly pathetic.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nLawyer An took a sharp breath,\n\nAttempting to open his eyes,\n\nHe only felt his vision blur.\n\nEven a slight bit of light caused him discomfort.\n\nWith no other choice,\n\nLawyer An closed his eyes again.\n\n\"Boss.\"\n\n\"Old Daoist wasn't rescued?\"\n\nBai Yingying and the little loli also walked over.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!\"\n\nThe little monkey, held in Bai Yingying's arms, was very excited, waving its paws. Not seeing Old Daoist brought out, the little monkey was very anxious.\n\nAs a reincarnated spirit monkey, it was exceptionally intelligent and naturally understood that if the situation weren't so tricky, their boss would definitely have brought Old Daoist out with them.\n\n\"Let's get in the car first.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened the car door for Lawyer An and helped him sit inside. Then, Zhou Ze also got into the car.\n\nThe car drove out of the police station's vicinity and stopped at a streetlamp.\n\nLawyer An opened the car door and stumbled out, bending over and directly retching.\n\n\"Carsick?\"\n\nBai Yingying asked curiously.\n\nAlthough Lawyer An drove himself, some people don't get carsick when driving but do when they are passengers.\n\nZhou Ze handed him a bottle of mineral water and helped Lawyer An unscrew the cap.\n\nLawyer An took the mineral water and poured it directly onto his face, rubbing vigorously. Finally, he let out a long sigh and said,\n\n\"Things are a bit troublesome. Old Daoist wasn't hypnotized; he was cursed.\"\n\n\"Cursed?\" Zhou Ze frowned.\n\nHe had little experience with curses. The last time was perhaps during that Sea God incident, when that rich old man was cursed by the Sea God.\n\n\"Yes, he was cursed. The curse is too powerful, and I can't break it. Now, the only way to break it is to find the person who cast it.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nLawyer An took the tissue Bai Yingying offered and wiped his face again, reminding,\n\n\"By the way, the one who cast the curse might not necessarily be a person. It could be something evil they encountered. Some ritualistic items can also contain talismans.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"How the hell would I know?\" Lawyer An suddenly waved his hands and shouted, \"I almost got locked in and couldn't get out myself. I was almost controlled by that thing!\n\nIt's like a contagious disease, a contagious disease!!!\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nLawyer An hugged his head,\n\nSquatted down,\n\nAnd said softly,\n\n\"Sorry, I lost my composure...\"\n\n\"Boss?\" Bai Yingying looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and said, \"Investigate!\"\n\nYes, investigate the matter thoroughly. Since this incident involved Old Daoist and people from the bookstore, Zhou Ze could no longer stand idly by.\n\nBefore, his help to Old Zhang in investigating cases might have just been out of interest, something to do.\n\nBut this time, he was getting serious.\n\n\"Yingying.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\n\"Call Zheng Qiang, Liu Chuyu, and Yue Ya. Tell them to drop everything they're doing and come over immediately. Tell them if they're late, I'll break their soul blood.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\n\"Lin Ke, go find Old Zhang now. Since he just took the blame and was transferred out of the task force, have him take a leave of absence. We won't rely on the police for this; we'll investigate it ourselves.\"\n\nThe little loli nodded, \"I'm going now.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down and patted Lawyer An's shoulder, asking,\n\n\"Did your soul get scared out of you?\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Lawyer An waved his hand. \"But there's one thing I want to remind you: once you find any clues, don't alert the enemy. Even I almost fell for it; they won't be able to resist it.\"\n\n\"I understand that.\"\n\n\"Let Old Daoist stay at the police station for now. After all, it's the judicial organ of the mortal world and has a certain restraining effect on curses. Moreover, even if he's considered responsible, it will take a long time through a series of procedures.\n\nHowever, you need to think about one issue and prepare for it, because you can't go to the police with a conclusion of an unnatural phenomenon and expect them to release him. The court won't accept this kind of evidence either.\"\n\n\"We'll deal with the rest later. No matter what, we can't just let Old Daoist take the blame and lose his life.\"\n\n\"Heh, it's rare to see you so serious.\"\n\nLawyer An stood up. \"I'll go back and rest for a bit. Sharpening the axe doesn't delay chopping wood. They should all arrive in the latter half of the night. We'll compile the information we have then and then assign tasks for the investigation.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Knock knock knock!\"\n\n\"Knock knock knock!\"\n\n\"Who is it? Who is it! Knocking so hard, are you trying to summon a soul?!\"\n\nA middle-aged woman opened the door. Her hair was still wet, and she was wearing pajamas, revealing a large area of her skin, but she didn't mind opening the door like this.\n\n\"Do you recognize this person?\" Zhou Ze took out Old Daoist's photo.\n\nThe woman was startled and immediately shook her head, \"Don't know. Who knows this old geezer!\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking,\n\nThe woman was about to close the door.\n\nBai Yingying next to her reached out and blocked the door, then pushed with a little more force. The door was pushed open, and the woman fell to the ground.\n\nTrying to play tug-of-war with a female zombie, has your brain been caught in the door?\n\n\"Are you police?\" the woman shouted from the ground.\n\nZhou Ze walked in directly, and Bai Yingying closed the door.\n\nThen,\n\nBai Yingying consciously lifted the woman up, grabbed her hands behind her back with one hand, and held her neck with the other.\n\n\"Answer the Boss's questions properly, or I'll break your neck.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Bai Yingying exerted a little force on her wrist. The woman cried out in pain, but her neck was being choked by Bai Yingying, preventing her from screaming.\n\nThe female zombie, who had been \"cooing\" in front of Zhou Ze,\n\nWas not easy to deal with when she was outside.\n\nTo save time, getting straight to the point and showing the other party some color is often the most efficient way. Zhou Ze wasn't a police officer, so he could be a bit unrestrained.\n\n\"Did he come to see you yesterday afternoon?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman became honest. She had some experience in the world, and from their demeanor, these two were definitely not police officers.\n\nIt was precisely because she realized they weren't police that she became even more afraid.\n\n\"He did come to see me, but I've told the police everything I know. This scoundrel, do you know, I originally had good feelings for him. Although he's a bit older, his 'performance' was very good.\n\nHe was much better than those twenty-something young 'silver spears and wax heads,' and he was also attentive and considerate, knowing to 'warm up' first instead of just taking off his pants...\"\n\nBai Yingying listened with great interest.\n\nThese things,\n\nWere not mentioned in \"The Maid's Self-Cultivation.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand: \"There's no need for detailed explanations on this.\"\n\nShe still wanted to hear more;\n\nBai Yingying exclaimed in her heart.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\" The woman pursed her lips and continued, \"Who knew that after that scoundrel finished with me, he ran off to commit murder, causing me to be investigated by the police too, and I almost got implicated. You tell me, can my profession withstand an investigation?\"\n\n\"Did he have any unusual behavior that day?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Unusual?\" The woman shook her head. \"I didn't feel anything. He was as enduring as usual. However, after the second time, when he was paying, he said he left his phone at the upstairs resident's place. He went up to get his phone, and after he went, he never returned.\n\nI thought it was strange at the time. Logically, he wasn't a stingy person, nor would he cheat us 'poor souls' out of our hard-earned money. Moreover, I told him he didn't have to pay, but he insisted. Why did he just disappear?\"\n\n\"Then,\n\nHe left and never came back, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He didn't come back. Later, the police came and arrested him, saying he committed murder, and that he killed the old man living upstairs.\n\nI'm puzzled, why would two old men get into a fight and resort to knives and guns to kill someone? Do they really think they're hot-blooded youths?\"\n\n\"Anything else? I'm asking if he came to see you twice that day, and if there were any changes between those two times?\"\n\n\"You're a man, you should understand.\n\nAfter the first time, the second time will be more enduring.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Oh, speaking of changes, there was one,\" the woman suddenly remembered something, pondered for a moment, and continued, \"I remember every time he came, he would take out a talisman when he took off his pants.\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes suddenly became sharp.\n\nOld Daoist's talisman!\n\n\"He said it was his way, and he bragged about how powerful the talisman was. Every time he came, when he took off his pants, he would take out the talisman and stick it on me.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nThis was Old Daoist's self-defense mode after being tricked by that white fox at the club last time.\n\nSticking a talisman on him was the last line of defense.\n\nTo avoid being capsized in the gutter.\n\nFortunately, this guy,\n\nEven checked the license plate to see if it was a fake plate when he got into the car.\n\n\"But the second time, when he took off his pants, there was no talisman. I even asked him, and he said he left it upstairs. Then we started the second round.\"\n\nZhou Ze abruptly stood up,\n\nThe talisman,\n\nThe key to the problem was found.\n\nThat is,\n\nBetween the two times,\n\nWhere did Old Daoist use the talisman!",

Even now, recalling the image of eyes covering the ceiling when he entered still made him feel a little uneasy.\n\nIf it were in the past, he definitely wouldn't have continued investigating this matter, as it could bring him into danger.\n\nDon't let Lawyer An's reputation for being involved in both the underworld and the legal world fool you. If he had insisted on being tough in every situation, he would have died countless times by now.\n\nThat curse was indeed very powerful. And judging by its state, with only a few eyes on the ceiling half-open, it was clearly still in hibernation and not fully awake.\n\nIf his investigation continued to provoke and stir it, and that thing completely woke up, the consequences would be severe.\n\nBut since Zhou Ze insisted on investigating further to find the truth for his subordinates,\n\nLawyer An couldn't exactly say \"no.\"\n\nIn other words,\n\nHe was now Zhou Ze's employee. If you stopped the boss from saving his employees, what kind of message would that send?\n\nDid he want the boss to abandon him when he encountered problems in the future?\n\nAs his thoughts raced, another message arrived in the WeChat group.\n\n\"I've investigated all the information about the deceased. I'm sending it to the group now.\"\n\nZheng Qiang and Liu Chuyu were responsible for investigating the information of the deceased old man.\n\nBecause the old Daoist couldn't have committed murder,\n\nAnd that person was dead,\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe cause of that person's death must have had another reason.\n\nObtaining information about the old man was also a crucial matter.\n\nBecause if something wanted to target the book house,\n\nYou could say that it was being cautious by not directly targeting Zhou Ze. But did it need to be so meticulous as to target the old Daoist first?\n\nIt was like two countries at war,\n\nWhere one country sent out excellent assassins,\n\nSpecifically to assassinate the doorman at the gate of the opposing country's city...\n\nOf course, to quickly investigate a person's life history, even the police would find it difficult. This wasn't something you could find by simply sitting at a computer and typing. Household registration information only had a few words, right?\n\nIt would require interviews, and even using some special means if the other party was uncooperative. Having two ghost messengers with special abilities do this task would be quite convenient.\n\nLawyer An tagged Old Zhang in the group.\n\nOld Zhang replied with an \"OK\" emoji.\n\nAfterward,\n\nLawyer An leaned sideways to look out the car window. The police station was across the street.\n\n\"Swoosh!\"\n\n\"Swoosh!\"\n\n\"Swoosh!\"\n\nThree silver needles flew out, hitting three on-duty detention center police officers. All three fell unconscious.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nThree sleeping Kogoro Mori appeared at the entrance of the detention center.\n\nYueya put down the remaining silver needles and clapped her hands at Old Zhang, saying,\n\n\"Done. They'll sleep for about half an hour.\"\n\nOld Zhang nodded. Although the feeling of sneaking into the detention center felt a bit strange, at this moment, he couldn't afford to be bothered by personal moral潔癖¹ (cleanliness/pedantry).\n\nHe had been expelled by the task force and was no longer allowed to be involved in this case.\n\nThe reason was that allowing external personnel to participate in the investigation was a violation of discipline. However, no one suspected him, the police hero who had just completed a daring undercover mission and returned from the brink of death, of having any issues.\n\nHe moved the three colleagues to sit on chairs so they could sleep more comfortably.\n\nAs for the surveillance here, Old Zhang had tampered with it before they arrived.\n\nSo,\n\nThe most secure fortresses are often breached from within.\n\nZhang Yanfeng felt a bit like a villain in a crime movie and was quite uncomfortable.\n\nBut he quickly found the person he was looking for, opened the door, and gently kicked the old man lying on the sleeping mat.\n\nThe old man was the murderer from sixteen years ago.\n\nBecause the subsequent investigation had not concluded, and he had not yet been sentenced by the court, the old man was still temporarily held in the detention center at the police station.\n\nOnly after being sentenced would he be transferred to prison to await execution.\n\nThis old man was also interesting. Describing him as wicked and thoroughly evil wouldn't be an exaggeration, but he showed no fear of death. If his boss hadn't intervened back then, he would have jumped off a building to commit suicide long ago.\n\nHowever,\n\nIt is precisely this kind of person who is the most terrifying.\n\nThe old man rubbed his eyes and looked at the person in front of him with confusion, then said helplessly,\n\n\"I've already told you, I didn't bury the extra bodies, and they have nothing to do with me. I wish I had killed them, but it really wasn't me.\n\nAlright,\n\nLet me sleep.\n\nI'm old,\n\nAnd I don't sleep soundly anymore.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng picked up the old man.\n\nEven though Old Zhang was a good policeman, he had no psychological burden when dealing with this scumbag.\n\n\"I have some other things I want to ask you.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay, I'll talk, I'll talk. Let go of me, let go of me.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng released his grip.\n\nHe brought up a photo on his phone and placed it in front of the old man.\n\nHe asked,\n\n\"Do you recognize him?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nThe old man leaned closer, looked carefully, and asked confusedly, \"He looks... a bit familiar.\"\n\n\"I've investigated this guy's past and found out he used to be a retired worker from the textile factory, the one that used to be behind your house.\"\n\n\"Oh!!!\" The old man exclaimed immediately, \"I remember, I remember! It's him, Old Liu Tou!\"\n\n\"So you do know him.\"\n\n\"I know him, of course I know him.\n\nHahaha,\n\nDidn't I tell you guys before?\n\nI dumped human flesh there,\n\nAnd someone foolishly picked it up, thinking they had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe ate until his mouth was greasy and even came to show off to me.\n\nThe one I often played chess with,\n\nOld Liu Tou!\"\n\nUpon hearing this,\n\nA glint immediately flashed in Old Zhang's eyes.\n\nHe grabbed the old man's collar and said sternly,\n\n\"You're saying he ate human flesh?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nThe old Daoist was leaning there, drooling drowsily.\n\nYueya, too lazy to find a key, directly used a silver needle to open the lock and walked in.\n\nThere were definitely more than just these two people imprisoned in the detention center.\n\nBut the old man was a murderer,\n\nAnd the old Daoist in front of her was also suspected of being an executioner responsible for more than ten lives.\n\nIt was only natural for him to enjoy the treatment of an \"individual large room.\"\n\n\"Old Daoist, wake up, Old Daoist, wake up!\"\n\nYueya reached out and nudged the old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist opened his eyes.\n\nAnd looked at the woman in front of him.\n\n\"Do you still recognize me?\" Yueya asked, pointing to herself.\n\n\"The boss's newly recruited... lackey...\"\n\n\"...\" Yueya.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nA sudden impulse surged within Yueya,\n\nThat was to directly kill this old fellow with her needles.\n\nBut she suppressed her inner anger and continued to ask,\n\n\"The boss asked me to ask you something. The talisman you always kept in your crotch, where did you use it yesterday?\"\n\nThe old Daoist shook his upper body, dazed.\n\n\"What thing...\"\n\n\"The talisman, your talisman, the one you always kept hidden in your crotch,\" Yueya reminded him.\n\n\"I killed someone... I ate someone... I killed someone... I ate someone too... I'm guilty... I'm guilty... I'm truly guilty...\"\n\nThe old Daoist began to answer numbly.\n\nHis already unfocused eyes became even more clouded at this moment.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nYueya licked her lips and simply inserted a silver needle into the old Daoist's chest and twisted it.\n\nThis was acupuncture, not lethal, but it could cause immense pain.\n\nBut the old Daoist acted as if he were fine, continuing to shake his body and drool.\n\nAs if,\n\nHe couldn't feel the pain at all.\n\nAt this point,\n\nYueya was helpless.\n\nShe took out her phone and sent a message to the WeChat group:\n\n\"I can't get anything out of him, and I feel like his condition is even worse than what you described before.\"\n\n\"That's the curse starting to spread. Eventually, it will slowly erode his mind and erase his original thoughts.\n\nSo,\n\nWhat we should be worried about now isn't whether he'll take the blame or be executed,\n\nBut if we don't hurry,\n\nEven if his body isn't dead, his soul will have already been tainted.\n\nAnd this is even with him being in the police station, suppressed by the aura of earthly justice.\"\n\nLawyer An was sending messages in the group.\n\n\"Boss, the group says the Old Daoist's condition is very bad and getting worse,\" Bai Yingying said to Zhou Ze, holding her phone beside him.\n\nThe two of them had already entered the crime scene. The police had set up a cordon and put up a seal, but Zhou Ze had directly torn it open and entered.\n\nValuable physical evidence had been taken by the police, even the pots and pans from the kitchen. The already empty house was now even more so.\n\n\"The freezer is gone too.\"\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips.\n\nHow could he find anything like this?\n\nOld Daoist,\n\nWhere exactly would he have used the talisman?\n\n\"Tell Old Zhang to find a way to go to the evidence room with Yueya again,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay, boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately replied.\n\nAfter sending the message back, Bai Yingying looked at Zhou Ze and asked, \"Boss, where are we going now?\"\n\n\"Wait for me to use the restroom, and then we'll go meet up with Old An and the others.\"\n\nZhou Ze said,\n\nAnd walked into the restroom.\n\nFortunately,\n\nThe police hadn't removed the toilet.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze froze.\n\nHe remembered that the police report stated that the old Daoist had mentioned drinking quite a bit that night. The woman downstairs had also said that the old Daoist smelled strongly of alcohol when he came to her the second time.\n\nA semi-drunken old Daoist,\n\nStanding in front of the toilet,\n\nWhen he took out his thing from his crotch to relieve himself,\n\nWould he have coincidentally taken out the talisman?\n\nAnd then,\n\nWould he have placed the talisman...\n\n\"Huh? Yingying, what are you doing?\"\n\nZhou Ze was taken aback,\n\nSeeing Bai Yingying squatting in front of him, unbuckling his belt.\n\n\"Yingying, Yingying,\n\nIt's okay, boss. You think about your things.\n\nThe rest,\n\nYingying will take care of.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.",

    "content": "\"Yingying.\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"Let go.\"\n\n\"Oh, boss.\"\n\nYingying pouted and stood up, looking dejected.\n\n\"Who taught you this, was it Link?\"\n\nThat damned loli, what was she teaching my Yingying?\n\n\"No, it says so in the book.\"\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily speechless.\n\nHe suddenly remembered the book \"The Self-Cultivation of a Maid\" that Yingying always carried with her.\n\nWhat was this book teaching children?\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to educate Yingying properly, to tell her that he was the kind of boss who would sleep with his subordinates.\n\nBut then he thought about it, he made Yingying sleep with him every day, and even helped him bathe...\n\nIt seemed that bosses who slept with their subordinates didn't do anything as excessive as he did.\n\nAlright, let's put this matter aside for now.\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands and began to ponder.\n\nHe was thinking,\n\nIf the old Taoist had gone to the toilet here last night and found a talisman, where would he have put it?\n\nAnd considering the old Taoist was half-drunk at the time, his consciousness probably wasn't very clear.\n\nNow,\n\nIt was a case of dead horses being treated as live ones.\n\nEven if it was a long shot, he had to try.\n\nHe looked around the toilet, this toilet, at this location, a place where something could temporarily be put...\n\nZhou Ze's gaze fell on the toilet tank lid.\n\nThe floor was too dirty, and other places weren't suitable.\n\nIt seemed that only the toilet tank lid was suitable, and the distance was also convenient.\n\nZhou Ze placed his hand on the toilet tank lid.\n\nOn top,\n\nThere was nothing.\n\nBut as Zhou Ze's palm covered it,\n\nHe sensed a sticky feeling, and it was rough,\n\nAs if this area had been scorched by fire, the texture was different from other parts of the tank lid.\n\nThis was a subtle difference that couldn't be seen with the naked eye, only felt with the touch of his hand.\n\nZhou Ze kept rubbing.\n\nHe had roughly traced the area.\n\nIt was a rectangle, a sharp-angled rectangle.\n\nInstinctively,\n\nThe image of the talisman that the old Taoist often took from his crotch appeared in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nTalismans were also rectangular.\n\nThis meant that\n\nWhen the old Taoist, in a muddled, half-drunk state, came here to pee last night,\n\nHe took out the talisman he had been hiding in his crotch,\n\nAnd placed it on the toilet tank lid.\n\nThen,\n\nThe talisman worked in this area of the toilet tank lid.\n\nYes,\n\nThe talisman had burned!\n\nThe talisman sensed something, or came into close contact with something, so it reacted!\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze had a guess.\n\nAccording to Lawyer An, the main body of the cursed object should still be dormant.\n\nAnd considering the old Taoist's strange physique that attracted lightning,\n\nDid this guy, just by going to the toilet,\n\nAnd casually sticking a talisman,\n\nStimulate that thing awake?\n\nShaking his head,\n\nHe decided to put the old Taoist's physique aside for now.\n\nZhou Ze placed his hands on either side of the toilet tank lid.\n\nNow,\n\nThe clue was clear.\n\nThe cursed object,\n\nShould be inside the toilet tank lid!\n\n\"Boss, Yingying will help you open it.\"\n\nThe loyal maid is back online, solving all your troubles!\n\n\"Don't!\"\n\nBut it was too late when Zhou Ze stopped her.\n\nYingying directly lifted the toilet tank lid.\n\nIt was unbelievably swift and decisive!\n\nAt this moment,\n\nBeneath the toilet tank lid, a jade pendant with a doll's face, which was previously taped to the back, suddenly emitted a glow.\n\nIt looked like a doll's face,\n\nAnd it showed a smile,\n\nSinister and eerie.\n\nYingying staggered.\n\nShe felt a sense of crisis.\n\nTo avoid implicating her boss,\n\nShe immediately gritted her teeth and put the toilet tank lid back down.\n\nThen she collapsed on the ground.\n\n\"Yingying, Yingying, are you alright?\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately crouched down.\n\n\"Boss... my head... my head hurts so much...\" Yingying pouted, then turned her head towards the toilet and said, \"Inside there, it seems... it seems there's something.\"\n\n\"It's good that you're alright, it's good that you're alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze helped Bai Yingying up, letting her lean against the wall. He then took out his phone and sent a message in the WeChat group, saying that the cursed object had likely been found and asking everyone to gather.\n\nBefore,\n\nZhou Ze had not tried to open the toilet tank lid to check, just in case.\n\nAfter all,\n\nLawyer An had warned him,\n\nThat thing was terrifying, like a contagious disease. Before everyone gathered to discuss a foolproof plan, even if they found it, they shouldn't alert it.\n\nAnd then,\n\nHis own maid,\n\nThought she wasn't strong enough to move the toilet tank lid.\n\nZhou Ze felt both annoyed and amused at this moment.\n\nHe squatted down,\n\nLit a cigarette,\n\nAnd kept staring at the toilet in the bathroom ahead.\n\nWhy would the dead old man have this thing in his house?\n\nCould it be that,\n\nThis old man was the murderer who killed one person every year and buried them by the river?\n\nWait,\n\nWait,\n\nHow did the old Taoist know this murderous old man?\n\nAnd was even invited over for drinks and a meal?\n\nAnd used his toilet?\n\nUsing the toilet was one thing,\n\nBut he even stuck a talisman?\n\nAnd stuck it in the right place?\n\nZhou Ze felt a headache coming on.\n\nBefore, when Zhang Yanfeng was pestering him to investigate the case, he had pushed it off, telling Old Zhang to find the old Taoist.\n\nAnd he even said that the old Taoist was \"good to know once you use him, everyone says so.\"\n\nThe truth,\n\nIndeed, was like that!\n\nThe real culprit,\n\nThe true cause,\n\nThe mundane,\n\nAnd the supernatural,\n\nThe old Taoist had cleared the way for you...\n\nHow on earth did this guy live to be seventy-one years old?\n\nJust then,\n\nBai Yingying, who was sitting next to Zhou Ze, suddenly opened her eyes. Bloodshot began to spread in her eyes, and her fangs slowly appeared.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nYingying thrust her hands forward, but halfway through, she retracted them, let her arms fall back down, and closed her eyes again.\n\nZhou Ze stubbed out his cigarette, turned his head, and saw his maid with her eyes closed, asking, \"Are you still feeling unwell?\"\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nYingying bit her lip,\n\nHer voice filled with sorrow,\n\nAs if she was restraining something.\n\n\"What's wrong, Yingying?\"\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"I'm here.\"\n\n\"Pierce me!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Pierce me quickly!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Pierce me hard!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, Yingying feels like she's losing control, quickly use your nails to pierce me!\"\n\n\"Are you cursed?\"\n\nZhou Ze realized the seriousness of the situation. He had originally thought Yingying was not an ordinary person, that her zombie constitution would give her stronger resistance to curses, but he didn't expect things to be developing towards losing control.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nThe doll-faced jade pendant carved on the toilet tank lid became more intensely sinister, and cracks could be seen appearing on the jade pendant.\n\nDeep within it,\n\nIt was as if a ball of fire was burning,\n\nAs if a talisman was struggling fiercely inside.\n\nThe water in the toilet tank began to boil,\n\nAnd along with it,\n\nThe blood-red color in Yingying's eyes also began to boil!\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nYingying suddenly reached out and stabbed directly at Zhou Ze's chest.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively leaned back and rolled on the ground, dodging the attack.\n\n\"Yingying!\"\n\nBai Yingying slowly stood up. Her long hair fluttered, and a bluish eyeshadow kept spreading from the corners of her eyes. Her fingernails began to grow longer,\n\nThe most striking thing was,\n\nHer two fangs,\n\nBrewing a deadly allure and killing intent!\n\n\"Control it, don't let it control you!\"\n\nZhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"You can do it, control it. When Old An arrives, when Old An and the others come, we can solve the problem!\"\n\nA hint of red flickered in Bai Yingying's eyes,\n\nBut it was quickly\n\nSuppressed.\n\nA doll's face,\n\nAppeared on Bai Yingying's forehead.\n\nThe doll's face bore a look of malice.\n\n\"What are you, get out of her!\" Zhou Ze yelled.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nYingying's figure disappeared from her original spot.\n\nThen she appeared in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze dodged again, avoiding Bai Yingying's claws, but was still violently bumped by Bai Yingying's shoulder.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze smashed through the door behind him, falling into the room, and slid a considerable distance across the tiles.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nHe reached up,\n\nWiped the blood from the corner of his mouth,\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up.\n\nBai Yingying walked to the doorway, her long, disheveled hair now looked like a demon that had just crawled out of hell.\n\nThe maid who would usually coo cutely at him,\n\nNow,\n\nShowed no expression at all,\n\nOnly coldness,\n\nNothing but coldness.\n\n\"Yingying? Yingying?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to call out.\n\nTo speak frankly,\n\nIf the old Taoist had an accident, so be it.\n\nAfter all, that old guy was either having an accident or running towards one all day.\n\nBut Yingying's current state,\n\nTruly made Zhou Ze panic,\n\nHis mind in chaos, filled with anxiety.\n\nYingying rushed at him again, baring her fangs, bringing a chilling wind.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively extended his fingernails,\n\nThe two of them's fingernails tangled together.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward,\n\nHis fingernails grew longer again.\n\nFive fingernails pinned Bai Yingying in place,\n\nThen, with his other hand, his fingernails were poised to strike at Bai Yingying's neck!\n\nHowever,\n\nJust before his nails could pierce Bai Yingying's skin,\n\nZhou Ze stopped his hand.\n\nLooking at that smooth, fair skin on her neck,\n\nZhou Ze,\n\nCouldn't bear to.\n\nHe remembered that the first time he faced a awakened Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze could have used his nails to beat Bai Yingying to her knees begging for mercy and still not stop,\n\nBut now,\n\nHe really,\n\nCouldn't bear to...\n\nIn this moment of daze,\n\nBai Yingying seized the opportunity, turned her head, opened her mouth, and bit directly into Zhou Ze's arm.\n\n\"Crunch...\"\n\nA piece of flesh was bitten off by Bai Yingying.\n\nA terrifying sharp pain shot through him.\n\nZhou Ze immediately dodged,\n\nBut one step wrong,\n\nLed to a series of wrong steps.\n\nEspecially since Yingying had been advised by Lawyer An to learn Taekwondo during this time.\n\nAs Zhou Ze turned to dodge,\n\nHis right arm was also grabbed by Bai Yingying.\n\nThe terrifying strength of the female zombie was evident at this moment.\n\nShe didn't go for Zhou Ze's hands, because his nails were terrifying to her.\n\nShe grabbed Zhou Ze's arm with both hands,\n\nAnd twisted with all her might!\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nBoss Zhou's face turned ashen with pain.\n\nHe knew,\n\nHis arm,\n\nWas broken...",

    "content": "After breaking Zhou Ze's arm, Bai Yingying opened her mouth and bit directly at the position of Zhou Ze's neck, without any hesitation or pity.\n\nZhou Ze let out a low growl, and waved his other hand.\n\nBai Yingying had an instinctive fear of Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\nAt that moment, she leaned her upper body back, and at the same time, kicked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze flew backward and fell to the ground. When he got up, his body staggered, and because his right arm was broken, he couldn't exert force. In the end, he had to prop himself up with his left hand and slowly crawled up.\n\nBai Yingying's cold gaze was fixed on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Yingying...\"\n\nIn this situation, if anyone else had been cursed and lost their mind, Zhou Ze would have immediately gone up and killed them without a second thought. But when it came to Bai Yingying, Boss Zhou couldn't bring himself to do it.\n\nBai Yingying continued to move forward, Zhou Ze dangled one arm, silently watching Bai Yingying, who was constantly approaching him, his chest heaving.\n\n\"Tch.\"\n\nOn the tree opposite the balcony, Lawyer An squatted, with a monkey on his shoulder. The monkey desperately grabbed Lawyer An's hair, signaling Old An to hurry up and help!\n\n\"What are you in such a hurry for? This boss of ours, he's just asking for a lesson. At this time, he's still playing soft-hearted, being all lovey-dovey. I really can't stand it. If people didn't know, they'd think they were filming a romance drama. You go quickly, I won't go, you go quickly, I won't goooooo!\"\n\nThe monkey pestered, continuing to pull at Lawyer An's clothes.\n\n\"Don't rush, let's keep watching. See if he'll get beaten to death. Everyone else knows to work hard, but he only knows how to sit in the bookstore and drink coffee and read newspapers. Heh. Other people are like salted fish, but that's built on their own strength, that's the great freedom of taking a step back and seeing a wider sky. Him? He's like a poverty alleviation target now, a lazy person who hasn't gotten out of poverty but still enjoys the policies, doing one day's work as a monk for one day.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!!!\"\n\nThe monkey clearly didn't want to think about what Lawyer An was saying. It still strongly urged Lawyer An to save him.\n\n\"Can you not be so saintly?\" Lawyer An grabbed the monkey's head with disgust, and rubbed it. \"You died as a saint in your past life, why are you still like this in this life? If he gets killed by the female zombie here, then so be it. At most, I'll find another port.\"\n\nYes, at most, he would find another port. It wasn't that Lawyer An had ulterior motives, but because he had already told Zhou Ze that the winds were changing, and the underworld would undergo changes, which would also affect the mortal world. A great storm was coming, and small boats on the sea would definitely capsize and be unable to protect themselves, unless they hurried up and turned themselves into large ships, then they could withstand it and at least control their own destiny.\n\nAs a result, Zhou Ze was still the same. The other salted fish in the bookstore had all become more diligent under his influence, working hard to become stronger. Only the boss, remained as he was. A good bird chooses a tree to perch on. He couldn't afford to be idle and couldn't have other thoughts. This time, after receiving the news, he was in charge of dispatch and was in the car, so he was the first to arrive. If Zhou Ze were fighting with someone else, he would have joined the fight long ago. But Zhou Ze's current performance made Old An feel a bit disheartened.\n\n\"Yo, it's changing, the female zombie has changed again.\" Lawyer An stroked his chin. \"Interesting. She's just an ordinary zombie, but by sleeping with you every day, she can evolve by absorbing the aura you leak. And you?\"\n\nAt this moment, Bai Yingying's hair began to slowly turn white, and it had also grown much longer. White hair fluttered, truly possessing a dazzling, peerless beauty. Moreover, Yingying's nails were also longer than before. Although not as exaggerated as Zhou Ze's \"scythes,\" they were much longer than before. In the room, frost even began to form.\n\n\"Hiss...\" Bai Yingying took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. With each inhale and exhale, it was as if white silk was flowing. Perhaps it was because she had been sleeping with Boss all along, accumulating over time, or perhaps it was because the curse and the zombie's origin had fused and mutated after being cursed, in any case, Bai Yingying's aura had become much stronger than before.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat down, as if he had completely given up, and sat on the ground. Lawyer An on the distant tree trunk frowned. Was he just going to surrender? Preferring to be killed himself rather than harm his woman? Damn it, he didn't realize, you're actually such a devoted fool?\n\nLawyer An waved his hand. \"No hope, no hope. Didn't they say there's a dad sealed inside you? Call your dad out to help you! You probably can't bear to, afraid that guy will come out and kill her directly, right?\"\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!!!\"\n\n\"Are you annoying or what, damn it!\" Lawyer An stood up and grabbed the monkey. \"Listen, I'm only helping him because of your monkey face. If he doesn't die this time, I'll leave immediately. This guy is useless, this lawyer really can't serve him.\"\n\nHowever, just as Lawyer An was about to jump down from the tree, his body suddenly froze. He immediately looked up, staring intently inside. \"Something's not right...\"\n\n...\n\nBai Yingying walked towards Zhou Ze, her face showing only indifference. At this moment, she no longer recognized Zhou Ze, nor was she the maid who liked to warm the bed and bathe the boss.\n\nGlancing at his dangling right arm, Zhou Ze extended his left hand, spread it out, and said softly, \"Coffee.\"\n\nIn the distance, Lawyer An's earlobe twitched slightly. What? Coffee? You want to use this method to awaken her consciousness? Am I too naive, or are you too imaginative?\n\nBai Yingying raised her hand and rushed over. It was only a short distance away. With one sprint, she was already in front of Zhou Ze. It was obvious that Bai Yingying did not hesitate at all. She had been completely controlled, and her mind had been suppressed.\n\nHowever, at this moment, five black wisps of smoke emanated from Zhou Ze's fingertips, like chains, being released.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nBai Yingying was less than half a meter away from Zhou Ze. She had even leaped into the air just now, but at this moment, two wisps of smoke were locking her wrists, two wisps of smoke were locking her legs, and one wisp of smoke was locking her neck. Just like that, she was frozen in mid-air.\n\nZhou Ze sat there silently, his hand spread out, as if still waiting for his coffee. Lawyer An's expression was solemn, devoid of the previous teasing and mocking. And at this moment, a long tongue suddenly grabbed a branch next to him, and then a small figure landed beside her.\n\n\"An Buqi, what are you doing here? What's the situation inside?\" The little loli appeared on the branch. Immediately, the little loli saw the situation inside the house and was about to go up to help. But Lawyer An grabbed her hand.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Let's keep watching, no hurry.\"\n\n\"You're not in a hurry, but I am. I'm his subordinate ghost messenger. If he dies, he could drag me down with him before he dies!\" Indeed, the little loli and the other five ghost messengers had all officially recognized Zhou Ze as their captain. Their lives and deaths were actually in Zhou Ze's hands. Lawyer An could retreat completely and play the trick of watching from the sidelines, but the little loli couldn't. She couldn't gamble with her own life.\n\n\"Let me ask you a question, did he secretly cultivate?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He doesn't have time, nor can he do it. I've been in the bookstore all the time. He just likes to lie there and bask in the sun, drinking coffee. It's impossible, he has no time and no opportunity.\" Lawyer An muttered to himself.\n\n\"Roar!!!\" Just then, a more piercing sound came from the opposite room. Many of the nearby residents had turned on their lights at this time. However, because the zombie aura in that house was strong and emanating an eerie presence, it formed a special barrier. For most of the nearby households, they only heard the sound of thunder and didn't know what was making the noise. When Zhou Ze and the demon monkey fought in the hospital back then, there was so much commotion, but the people having surgery next door still didn't notice, precisely for this reason. Yin and Yang are on two separate paths, and humans and ghosts have different destinies, it's not just a saying.\n\nYingying began to struggle, struggling with all her might. However, the black mist binding her became thicker and thicker. Zhou Ze slowly raised his head, and his palm slowly pressed down.\n\n\"Thump!\" Under the binding and pressure of the black mist, Yingying fell to the ground, kneeling down directly. It could be seen that her resistance was fierce, but in front of Zhou Ze, under this restraint and pressure, her struggle seemed a bit pale and powerless.\n\n\"How... how could this be...\" the little loli exclaimed.\n\n\"The female zombie must have been infected with a curse and lost control.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking about that,\" the little loli shook her head. \"I'm asking... Boss...\"\n\n\"That's why I'm asking you, I've never seen him cultivate.\" Lawyer An swore that he saw Zhou Ze get up like clockwork every day and lie down by the window, waiting for the maid to bring him coffee and newspapers, and then he would lie there all day, closing his eyes and pretending to sleep!\n\n\"No, he can cultivate,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I told you, there's a terrifying guy sealed inside him. I suggested to him before that he should try to steal that guy's abilities.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"All I know is that he stole once, and those fingernails became longer and sharper. That's what he stole.\"\n\n\"Later?\"\n\n\"Later, I don't know.\" Lawyer An's eyes widened. In his mind, the leisurely image of Zhou Ze lying on the sofa every morning kept flashing. Could it be...\n\n\"Yue Ya and Zheng Qiang are also here, downstairs,\" the little loli pointed to two figures rushing into the corridor ahead and said.\n\n\"Lin Ke,\" Lawyer An suddenly called out.\n\n\"Hmm? What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Do you still remember what the best student in your class used to say when you were in school?\"\n\n\"They...\" Lin Ke tilted her head and thought. \"They liked to say that they never reviewed, and they still played games when they went home every day...\"\n\nImmediately, the little loli finally understood and gritted her teeth, saying, \"Men, as expected, are all big pig trotters who lie!!!\"",

    "content": "\"Roar!\"\n\nEven though she was completely restrained, Bai Yingying's struggles never ceased. In fact, through constant resistance, her potential was slowly being ignited.\n\nDay and night spent accompanying Zhou Ze in sleep,\nEven if it wasn't intentional, even if Boss Zhou hadn't actively done anything,\nBai Yingying had indeed been continuously nourished by her boss.\n\nTo say she was like a shy bud, tender and dripping with dew,\nwould be an exaggeration.\nBut the subtle changes were real.\n\nBai Yingying's constant closeness to Zhou Ze, her infatuation with his aura, her obedience to him,\nWhile her emotional choice was primary,\nher physiological needs could not be entirely denied.\n\nAnd people often unleash their power in their most frenzied moments.\nUnfortunately,\nthe person she had to face at this time,\nwas her boss.\n\nBai Yingying propped her elbows on the ground, her knees pressing against the tile. Her head remained held high.\n\n\"Crack... crack... crack...\"\n\nCracking sounds emanated, like a spiderweb first on the tiled floor, then spreading to the walls and ceiling.\nA terrifying force was brewing,\nlike a volcano about to erupt.\n\nZhou Ze remained seated,\nhowever,\nveins bulged on his palm, his lips pressed tightly shut.\nHis right arm was broken, leaving him to bear the load with only one arm, which was indeed a bit strained.\n\nHowever,\nat this moment,\nthis was the only way he could control Yingying without harming her.\n\nPreviously, he had been careless.\nWith the old Daoist priest as a precedent, even though he was cursed, aside from appearing a bit dull and disoriented, he hadn't shown such obvious aggression.\n\nWhy,\ncould the old Daoist priest endure it?\nBut Yingying was so quickly controlled?\nCould it be because the old Daoist priest was a normal person while Yingying was a zombie?\nPurely in terms of willpower, Yingying, who had endured two hundred years of solitude and torment, couldn't possibly be weaker than a disrespectful imposter Daoist priest.\n\nThe black mist began to distort under Bai Yingying's tearing, gradually weakening.\nThe next moment,\nZhou Ze let go and waved casually;\nthe black mist dissipated,\nand Yingying regained her freedom!\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nBai Yingying lunged directly at Zhou Ze.\nZhou Ze shook his hand, then spread it forward, uttering two words:\n\"Newspaper.\"\n\nThe black mist controlled by his five fingers instantly condensed, forming a black curtain that slapped down directly!\n\n\"Slap!!!\"\n\nA solid slap.\nYingying, who was charging, was slapped to the ground by Zhou Ze.\nThis time,\nher head, feet, and hands all made contact with the ground,\npressing her down so she couldn't move at all.\nFurthermore,\nthis slap dispersed much of Yingying's malevolent aura, reducing the intensity of her struggles.\n\nThis scene,\ntruly looked like someone had rolled up a newspaper into a bundle and smashed it directly onto someone's head.\nBoss Zhou's most frequent utterance every morning as he lay on the sofa was \"Coffee, newspaper.\"\n\nThis method of controlling black mist was stolen from that person, so naturally, he couldn't go and ask them what this move was called.\nZhou Ze hadn't decided on a name either.\nAnything too chuunibyou would seem vulgar.\nSo,\n\"Coffee\" and \"Newspaper\" were used as temporary placeholders.\n\nJust then,\na commotion was heard from outside.\n\"Boss!\"\n\nHad they arrived?\nZhou Ze flipped his wrist, the black mist dissipated, and Yingying staggered to her feet. She seemed somewhat bewildered but instinctively continued to charge at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Contain!\"\n\nThree mirrors flew directly in front of Zhou Ze, embedding themselves into the floor. Candle flames burned within each mirror, and the reflected light shone on Yingying, making her a little fearful and slowing her advance.\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest, feigning severe injury and weakness. But upon seeing this, he immediately shouted:\n\"Control her, don't hurt her!\nWhoever dares to hurt her, I'll break their soul blood!\"\n\nLiu Chuyu, who had just taken out a bamboo pole, stumbled.\nWhat the heck,\nit's like this?\nAt this moment,\nLiu Chuyu had the impulse to just retreat and let his boss get killed first.\n\n\"I'll suppress her, Yueya, use acupuncture needles! Lin Ke, assist!\"\nLawyer An's voice rang out.\nA skeleton hand shot out from nowhere, grabbing Bai Yingying by the neck, and then pressing down!\n\nThe female zombie was forced to bend over. Lawyer An's methods were quite forceful.\nCoupled with the fact that her malevolent aura had already been forcibly dispersed by Zhou Ze earlier, her current strength was greatly diminished.\n\nBut Bai Yingying couldn't surrender so easily. The female zombie turned sideways and swiped back.\nLawyer An's gaze sharpened. His skeleton hand and Bai Yingying's claws clashed over a dozen times, creating sparks.\nSeveral times,\nLawyer An had seen an opening to heavily injure Bai Yingying, but remembering Zhou Ze's earlier words, he suppressed the impulse.\n\nThe little loli's long tongue shot out, splitting into four in mid-air, wrapping around Yingying's arms and legs respectively.\nBai Yingying's body trembled, and her speed slowed considerably.\nDuring this time, under Lawyer An's guidance, the little loli had developed her tongue techniques more deeply.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nBai Yingying let out a furious roar.\nShe spread her arms,\nstill wanting to resist,\nseeming utterly tireless.\n\nLawyer An's skeleton hand directly pointed at Bai Yingying's forehead.\nClouds of pink smoke billowed out, instantly entering Bai Yingying's consciousness, causing the female zombie to stiffen and forget to move.\n\nAt this moment, Yueya, seizing the opportunity, finally acted. Silver needles shot out.\nFour silver needles pierced Bai Yingying's arms and legs.\nAnother needle pierced Bai Yingying's neck.\n\nLawyer An released his grip,\nand the little loli retracted her tongue.\nBai Yingying staggered,\nand finally,\ncollapsed on the ground,\nmotionless.\nHowever, the terror and ferocity of the female zombie still left them with lingering fear.\n\n\"Boss, are you alright?\"\nZheng Qiang ran over and helped Zhou Ze up. His gaze lingered on Zhou Ze's broken right arm, and a look of disdain appeared in his eyes.\nHe had seen Zhou Ze clash with Gu He and didn't believe that a rampaging female zombie could completely overpower him.\nIn the end,\nit was his own captain's soft-heartedness.\nBeing soft-hearted at a time like this was truly a luxury.\n\n\"I'm fine. Fortunately, you all arrived early, or I wouldn't have known what to do.\"\nAt this moment,\nLawyer An walked up to Zhou Ze, acting like a Qing Dynasty drama character, adjusting his sleeve and kneeling on one knee:\n\"This servant arrived late to save Your Excellency, please forgive me, Boss.\"\n\n\"So playful?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at Lawyer An.\n\"Heh heh.\"\nLawyer An chuckled, then pointed at Yueya and the little loli, saying, \"You two are responsible for watching her.\"\nYueya and the little loli nodded. The little loli also cast a meaningful glance at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"The cursed object is in the toilet tank lid. Is there a way to resolve it?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"Yingying opened the lid and was hit by that thing, which made her lose her mind.\"\n\"There's always a way. Since it's been found, it'll be easier to handle.\"\nLawyer An walked to the bathroom and observed the tank lid up close.\nEarlier,\nYingying had opened the tank lid, but sensing something was wrong, she immediately closed it again, worried about her boss being affected.\n\n\"This thing is quite potent, it can even control a female zombie.\"\nLawyer An frowned suddenly,\nthen looked back at the unconscious Bai Yingying.\nIn his mind,\nthe image of the old Daoist priest in the interrogation room appeared.\nSomething's not right.\nWhy was the female zombie directly controlled,\nwhile the old Daoist priest was merely disoriented?\n\n\"The old Daoist priest's talismans seem to have a restraining effect on it,\" Zhou Ze reminded him. \"There are traces of burned talismans on the tank lid.\"\n\"Does that guy have any more talismans?\" Lawyer An asked. \"I remember I wanted to ask him for two last time, and he said he only had one ancestral talisman left.\"\nIf there were to be a ranking of the study's unsolved mysteries, one of them would surely be:\nHow many talismans are there in the old Daoist priest's pants?\n\n\"Then let's take the tank back, and take the female zombie back. First, we'll find the old Daoist priest's ancestral talismans.\"\n...\n\nThe toilet tank was carefully moved into the study by Liu Chuyu and Zheng Qiang. They were afraid that the tank might break or that some other accident might occur, causing them to be cursed as well.\nThe little loli, Yueya, and Lawyer An went to search the old Daoist priest's room, rummaging through everything to find talismans.\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa on the first floor. At this moment, no one had the time to attend to Zhou Ze's injuries.\nCompared to Zhou Ze's current injuries, breaking the curse and rescuing the female zombie and the old Daoist priest were the top priorities.\n\nAfter searching for a long time, they couldn't find where the old Daoist priest had hidden the talismans.\nIn the end,\nit was the little monkey who came to the rescue, finding an oil-paper package in a gap beneath the bar, containing a thick stack of talismans.\n\n\"Did he buy these wholesale from a market?\"\nLawyer An said, weighing the heavy stack of talismans in his hand.\nEven with his extensive knowledge, he had never seen talismans of this caliber sold by weight.\nThis quantity,\nit means the old Daoist priest's ancestors spent their lives drawing talismans, besides eating and drinking, right?\n\n\"Let's try to see if we can break the curse,\" Zhou Ze urged.\nLooking at Bai Yingying lying there, motionless, Zhou Ze felt a pang of pity.\n\"Mm,\" Lawyer An nodded and walked to the tank lid. He didn't directly paste the talismans but signaled Xu Qinglang to come over and help him paste more talismans around the area, just in case.\nOnce the arrangements were made,\nLawyer An began to paste the talismans onto the tank lid.\nAs soon as one talisman was pasted, it immediately turned black and then slowly dissipated.\nThen came the second, third, and fourth...\nLawyer An felt like he was burning ghost money in the countryside, tossing the talismans one by one.\nFinally,\nafter pasting dozens of talismans,\nthe tank suddenly began to shake,\nas if something inside couldn't bear it and wanted to come out.\nBut its struggles seemed pale and weak.\nAfter struggling for a while,\nit quieted down.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked to the tank, looked at it, and asked, \"How is it?\"\nLawyer An shook his head, \"I'm not sure, and I can't confirm.\"\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe tank,\nat this moment, suddenly cracked...",

    "content": "As the water tank began to shatter,\n\n\n\neveryone in the bookstore quickly started to retreat.\n\n\n\nEven Zhou Ze and Lawyer An, who had been standing at the forefront before, subconsciously backed away.\n\n\n\nAt this point, there was no need to act tough and stand still.\n\n\n\n\"Tai Shan collapses before you, yet your expression doesn't change\"¹ sounds very cool, but after the coolness, you'll be buried alive immediately.\n\n\n\n\"Rumble!!!\"\n\n\n\nThe water tank was empty when it was brought over, but at this moment, viscous red liquid was dripping out.\n\n\n\nGenerally, fresh blood carries a strong腥臭味 (xīngchòu wèi - fishy, foul smell), but the blood here emitted a peculiar fragrance, giving one the illusion of bathing in a sea of flowers.\n\n\n\nEveryone present was not a rookie.\n\n\n\nThey all subconsciously \"held their breath,\"\n\n\n\nbut it was useless.\n\n\n\nOn the bookshelves on the first floor of the bookstore, tendrils began to spread. The tendrils were fake, as they appeared transparent, and around the tables and chairs, grooves appeared.\n\n\n\nThis felt like a 3D projection.\n\n\n\nThe false and the real began to blur at this moment.\n\n\n\nFrom the spot where the water tank had broken, a jade pendant floated out.\n\n\n\nThe doll-like face on the jade pendant,\n\n\n\nwas now twisted and contorted,\n\n\n\nas if it had been severely beaten.\n\n\n\nIt was almost unrecognizable,\n\n\n\nlike a deformed child.\n\n\n\nIf it was said that\n\n\n\nwhen the old Taoist priest² leisurely dropped a talisman paper back then, it was merely a slap to this fellow.\n\n\n\nThen Lawyer An, who had been throwing talisman papers like they were free, was equivalent to giving this \"doll\" a combination of military punches.\n\n\n\nIt was fortunate that the old Taoist priest wasn't here. If he knew that his precious ancestral talisman papers were being used by Lawyer An like toilet paper, he would probably chase Lawyer An with a knife for eight blocks.\n\n\n\nThe swollen-faced doll\n\n\n\nfound it a little difficult to maintain its previous eerie and sinister demeanor.\n\n\n\nNow, it looked\n\n\n\nrather comical and ridiculous.\n\n\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\n\n\nThe jade pendant began to crack,\n\n\n\npiece by piece,\n\n\n\nfragment by fragment, it fell.\n\n\n\nBut the surrounding scene did not disappear;\n\n\n\ninstead, it became more real.\n\n\n\nIn a trance,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw a group of people kneeling around him. Some wore black robes, some wore white robes, all kneeling neatly.\n\n\n\nAnd behind the jade pendant,\n\n\n\nan iron frame appeared.\n\n\n\nA person was tied to the frame,\n\n\n\nand nine knives were inserted into this person!\n\n\n\nBlood dripped out continuously,\n\n\n\ndripping onto the jade pendant.\n\n\n\nThe people below began to chant together,\n\n\n\nworshipping together.\n\n\n\n\"This jade pendant is probably a totem of some ancient tribe, an evil artifact that is sacrificed to with living people every year,\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An said.\n\n\n\n\"Then how did it end up here?\"\n\n\n\n\"How would I know? Perhaps that dead old man knew, but his soul probably didn't even go to hell; it might have been absorbed by this thing directly.\"\n\n\n\nAt this moment,\n\n\n\nthe jade pendant was continuously splitting,\n\n\n\nit was estimated that it would completely dissipate not long from now.\n\n\n\nLawyer An licked the tip of his tongue and subconsciously took a step forward.\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze grabbed his wrist.\n\n\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\n\n\"It's such a shame for this thing to just fall apart like this.\"\n\n\n\n\"With this thing, aren't you afraid of losing merit³?\"\n\n\n\nLawyer An hesitated upon hearing this, but still didn't move.\n\n\n\nActually,\n\n\n\nLawyer An wasn't too concerned about losing or gaining merit. He was a big rogue now, not seeking promotion in the Underworld, nor wishing for great fortune in the human world.\n\n\n\nWhat made him hesitate was his worry that he might not be able to control this jade pendant, and in the end, be controlled by it.\n\n\n\nLawyer An glanced at Zhou Ze again,\n\n\n\nand found that Boss Zhou had been gritting his teeth.\n\n\n\nHeh.\n\n\n\nIt could be seen that\n\n\n\nBoss Zhou also wanted this jade pendant,\n\n\n\nand was holding back.\n\n\n\nForget it.\n\n\n\nSome things,\n\n\n\nit's best for them to return to dust as dust and earth as earth.\n\n\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\n\n\nThe jade pendant completely shattered,\n\n\n\nturning into gray dust and scattering.\n\n\n\nThe surrounding images also disappeared,\n\n\n\nand this memory sealed within the jade pendant also vanished.\n\n\n\nIt was unknown which tribe's sacrifice it was, or the exact origin of the jade pendant, but it had ended, and that was enough.\n\n\n\n\"Come, let's clean this up.\"\n\n\n\nAfter Zhou Ze gave the order,\n\n\n\nhe went to pick up Bai Yingying on his back.\n\n\n\nHe only had one hand that could move, making it inconvenient to carry her, but he still stubbornly refused the little loli who wanted to help,\n\n\n\nholding onto\n\n\n\nhis own stubbornness.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThe morning sun sprinkled down.\n\n\n\nOn the large bed, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying lay there.\n\n\n\nLawyer An had checked and said that the curse had been lifted with the disappearance of the jade pendant. The next step was just to wait for her to wake up.\n\n\n\nThe little loli slept on the floor under the bed, holding a mat, very displeased.\n\n\n\nAlthough she was still very close and could fall asleep, it was not as comfortable as sleeping on the soft, large bed.\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze, using the excuse that he liked to move around in his sleep, refused to let her sleep on the bed at this time, fearing that he would disturb Yingying. This made the little loli very upset!\n\n\n\n\"Eh, she's waking up.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw Bai Yingying's eyelids move a few times.\n\n\n\nSoon,\n\n\n\nBai Yingying opened her eyes.\n\n\n\nThere was no trace of blood in her eyes; they were clear.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt that Yingying was cuter at this moment. Last night's Yingying indeed felt too unfamiliar.\n\n\n\n\"Wuwuwu, Boss, what happened to me?\"\n\n\n\nYingying looked around with a hint of confusion.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gently flicked her nose.\n\n\n\nYingying's sparkling big eyes looked at Zhou Ze, very puzzled.\n\n\n\n\"It's good that you're awake. Rest for a while longer. If you need anything, just call Lin Ke.\"\n\n\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\nBai Yingying suddenly saw the plaster cast and bandages wrapped around Zhou Ze's right arm.\n\n\n\nHer expression immediately changed.\n\n\n\nThe usually pure and gentle her,\n\n\n\nnow had a face full of anger,\n\n\n\nand growled:\n\n\n\n\"Boss, what happened to your arm!\n\n\n\nTell Yingying, which bastard slut injured you.\n\n\n\nYingying will go and eat him right away!!!!!\n\n\n\nHow dare they injure the boss like this, I definitely won't let them off!\"\n\n\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\n\n\nThe little loli couldn't help but laugh.\n\n\n\n\"It's nothing. I've already dealt with that person.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze got out of bed and reached out to stroke Bai Yingying's head.\n\n\n\n\"You have the day off. Rest today. When you wake up tomorrow morning, I want to see brewed coffee and the newspaper.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not necessary, Boss. Yingying feels like she's fine now.\n\n\n\nIf you want it, Yingying can give it to you anytime.\"\n\n\n\n\"If I told you to rest, then rest properly.\"\n\n\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze walked out of the bedroom.\n\n\n\nGoing downstairs,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze found his familiar spot on the sofa again,\n\n\n\nand lay down.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, Lawyer An came over with two cups of coffee and placed one in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze looked at the coffee in front of him,\n\n\n\nand was stunned for a moment.\n\n\n\n\"Drink up, don't be shy.\" Lawyer An said with a smile.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't a matter of politeness.\n\n\n\nIt was because you brewed expired instant coffee.\n\n\n\nLawyer An leisurely and smugly drank his expired coffee,\n\n\n\nthen, imitating Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nhe also lay down.\n\n\n\n\"Soaking up the sun, lying still, is indeed comfortable...\"\n\n\n\n\".........\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Yueya and the others left at dawn. Yingying has woken up, I just heard her voice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\n\nHe didn't feel bad about not keeping them for a meal.\n\n\n\nWhen he was a doctor before, he used to order his interns around like this.\n\n\n\n\"You were a doctor in your previous life, weren't you? Lin Ke told me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh right, Director Lin once chatted with me about some things from when she was an intern. Do you know what she remembers most vividly?\"\n\n\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\n\nTruly,\n\n\n\nhe was a bit curious.\n\n\n\nWhen she was an intern, he was the one who supervised her.\n\n\n\n\"She remembers the first time we met to discuss cooperation. She and I were eating in the hospital cafeteria. She told me that when she was an intern, she followed a young surgeon. That surgeon was quite handsome and very charming.\"\n\n\n\nHehehe.\n\n\n\n\"She said that at that time, they encountered a patient with ascariasis intestinal obstruction. Her teacher asked her to be an assistant in the laboratory. After her teacher opened the patient's abdomen, he took out a large basin of roundworms.\"\n\n\n\n\"That scene was indeed terrifying.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze chuckled. He had forgotten about this incident. In fact, aside from a little memory, he didn't remember much about the time he supervised Doctor Lin as an intern.\n\n\n\nSingle by merit⁴,\n\n\n\nwhy should he have a good memory?\n\n\n\nQixi⁵, anniversaries, Valentine's Day, white, red, black, and all sorts of colored Valentine's Days, it was best to forget them all.\n\n\n\n\"No, no, no, the most terrifying thing wasn't that,\" Lawyer An said, sipping his coffee and laughing. \"Director Lin said that she was already scared stiff at the time.\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nher damn teacher,\n\n\n\nordered her to clean this basin of roundworms,\n\n\n\nand then,\n\n\n\ncount them!\n\n\n\nHahahaha, I'm dying of laughter, really dying of laughter! Don't you think her former teacher was a total pervert, who liked to order young and pretty interns to do such things to get a thrill?\"\n\n\n\n\".........\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\n\"Why aren't you laughing?\"\n\n\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pushed the coffee in front of him towards Lawyer An.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to drink coffee today. You drink it. From now on, you can drink as much coffee as you want from the counter. Don't be polite, and don't save it for me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\n\nThe two of them sat there for the entire morning.\n\n\n\nUnprecedentedly,\n\n\n\nthis time,\n\n\n\nLawyer An didn't say anything about Zhou Ze lying there basking in the sun.\n\n\n\nInstead, Zhou Ze felt that Lawyer An was looking at him with a meaningful smile,\n\n\n\nwhich made Zhou Ze's skin crawl and made him very uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\n\n\nas it was getting close to lunchtime,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze put down the book he was holding,\n\n\n\nand looked at Lawyer An:\n\n\n\n\"Did we forget something?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, don't say it, I have this feeling too, like we've forgotten something, but I can't quite recall it.\"\n\n\n\n..........\n\n\n\nInside the Tongcheng Police Detention Center,\n\n\n\nthe old Taoist priest grasped the iron bars,\n\n\n\nand cried out loudly:\n\n\n\n\"I didn't kill anyone! I didn't kill anyone!\n\n\n\nThey wronged me, they wronged me!\n\n\n\nLet me out, quickly let me out!!!\n\n\n\nBoss,\n\n\n\nsave me,\n\n\n\nBoss, save me!!!!\"\n\n---\n¹ \"泰山崩於面前而不變色\" (Tài shān bēng yú miànqián ér bù biàn sè) - A Chinese idiom meaning to remain calm in the face of disaster.
