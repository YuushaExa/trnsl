    "content": "「Hahahahahaha...」\n\nInside Bureau Chief Chu's office.\n\nUnrestrained laughter echoed.\n\nLooking at Lu Ding and Bai Hemian standing before him, he had truly never felt so exhilarated. Secretly pulling a fast one, then being discovered, seeing others furious – it was simply too exhilarating.\n\nSeeing that neither of them spoke, Bureau Chief Chu stood up, pulling one with each hand: \"Let's go, let's go, we're going to the ceremony.\"\n\n\"Bureau Chief Chu, this... this is a bit against the rules, isn't it?\"\n\nWatching the excitement was one thing, but attending the ceremony was another. Attending the ceremony meant sitting in the front row, as a VIP.\n\nThey were just investigators, so who would be sitting in the front row?\n\nBigwigs from various factions and leaders from the Three Bureaus.\n\nThis was like a university campus recruitment, where it was announced that there were several opportunities to join state-owned enterprises available at their school. A group of outstanding students held their meticulously prepared resumes, exquisite certificates, various honors, and national competition trophies.\n\nBut then, at the very beginning.\n\nA freshman like you runs over in slippers, *slap-slap*, and sits right in the middle of a group of leaders – not interviewers, but leaders!\n\nAnd then the leaders say,\n\n'Oh, him? He's fast-tracked*. He'll intern during holidays and be fast-tracked upon graduation.'\n\nAnd what's more, others can't say anything about you, because you're badass, you just *are* badass. Even if you don't compete, you're still badass.\n\nAs for why it's a freshman, that's right. Joining for a year versus joining for a month, if you convert the ratio, it's roughly equivalent to a freshman.\n\nAnd as for this state-owned enterprise, of course, it's 749.\n\n***\n\nThree Districts Martial Arts Tournament venue.\n\nShangguan Qing walked over somewhat disoriented, her heart a mix of emotions.\n\nThe atmosphere in the arena also grew hotter as more and more investigators gathered.\n\nBut no matter how much the number changed, their conversations invariably revolved around Lu Ding.\n\nInvestigators from Yunhai felt proud that Lu Ding was their colleague.\n\nThat's how badass he is. Our Yunhai just produces such formidable individuals.\n\nFor example, Xue Ning, in the crowd, loudly discussed his past encounter with Lu Ding, not shying away from the fact that he lost.\n\n\"Lost? So what if I lost? I could withstand two moves. But don't even talk about it, back then, Lu Ding really had a lot of strength. Just one kick, and on the first move, he was still holding back. The second move, he just instantly defeated me.\"\n\nAnd Wen Ruchu.\n\nHe had long recognized his own problems, so when Lu Ding was mentioned, he only slightly avoided the topic, and he was also a participant on the night they fought Shi Gandang.\n\nUntil Yan Feifan arrived.\n\nThe entire Yunhai—no, one could say all the investigators currently at the Three Districts Martial Arts Tournament—who didn't know he was Lu Ding's number one henchman?\n\nHe followed Lu Ding all the way from internship to formal employment, getting carried along in various ways.\n\nExcept for a few minor incidents, he was present at every one of Lu Ding's glorious moments.\n\nWalking among the crowd, Du Guang, who used to bully him, was still an intern investigator.\n\nSeeing Yan Feifan, he came up with a smiling face and called out \"Brother Feifan.\"\n\nHe didn't hold grudges.\n\nHe quickly blended in with everyone.\n\nIn this atmosphere, someone discovered the news on the official website and exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Holy cow, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian got fast-tracked!!\"\n\n\"Fast-tracked? Then that makes sense.\"\n\n\"They absolutely *had* to be fast-tracked. If those two came to fight us, wouldn't they just be bullying us? Hahahahaha.\"\n\n\"If you said anyone else was fast-tracked, I'd be the first to object; there's no precedent for it. But Lu Ding getting fast-tracked, I accept it. I saw the video of him fighting Shi Gandang, he just *bonk* almost split the guy in two.\"\n\n\"To be able to beat a monster comparable to a Sī Mìng Realm* to that extent, he deserves to be fast-tracked.\"\n\n\"Exactly, this is the right way! Fast-track them early. Otherwise, if you encountered them, it would truly be your bad luck. You might have the strength, but because you ran into them, you couldn't advance, you'd lose points for nothing, and you'd just have to surrender, because if you made a move, you'd just get beaten.\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, now that Bai Hemian and Lu Ding are fast-tracked, we'll have to rely entirely on our raw strength! Are you ready to feel the brutality from Yaodu*?!\"\n\nAs the news of Lu Ding and Bai Hemian being fast-tracked spread, everyone's motivation in the arena instantly rose by several notches.\n\nEspecially those talented investigators from the other two districts, who all went from listless to lively.\n\nLu Ding isn't participating, so let's fight! If Lu Ding isn't participating, why should anyone else be better than me?\n\nLet's clash!\n\nWhat, can you also gather power for a *bonk*?\n\nSuddenly, someone shouted: \"The Scholar-Warrior Sleeves*, it's Lu Ding.\"\n\nThe atmosphere in the arena instantly quieted. Everyone turned their heads to look at the walkway of the viewing platform, where a person wearing Scholar-Warrior Sleeves walked behind Deputy Bureau Chief Chu, truly eye-catching.\n\nEveryone knew that in Yunhai 749, only one person would wear the Scholar-Warrior Sleeves, and that was Lu Ding. It wasn't that no one had tried to imitate his style.\n\nBut they were usually shut down by a single phrase:\n\n\"Neither a scholar nor a warrior, yet you wear Scholar-Warrior Sleeves*.\"\n\n\"Do you really think you're Lu Ding, accomplished in both scholarship and martial arts?\"\n\nTens of thousands of eyes cast gazes of attention. This was the respect and fame Lu Ding had earned with his own two hands.\n\nThis was what was meant by \"achieving success and renown.\"\n\nImagine a bustling and lively gathering of ten thousand people, suddenly falling silent at your arrival, with tens of thousands of eyes all turning to gaze at you.\n\nAnd then, with a nod of acknowledgment after you took your seat, the atmosphere resumed, even more lively than before.\n\nA sense of accomplishment swelled within his heart.\n\n\"If that's the case, I'd really be too embarrassed to participate in the Baby Cup*,\" Lu Ding thought to himself.\n\nThis guy, he responds well to gentleness but not to force. If you understand the rules and are polite, he genuinely can't do anything about you.\n\nBut if you deliberately go against him, there are only two outcomes: getting beaten to death (the kind where you can't fight back), or getting beaten into submission, truly convinced, like Chen Xian last night.\n\n***\n\nSeeing him take his seat.\n\nQi Sword Sect viewing platform.\n\nThe middle-aged man turned to the young man beside him and whispered: \"Our Qi Sword Sect's allocated resources have decreased again this year. Originally, I planned to have your Ninth Junior Brother, who has been cultivating for eight years, challenge the top three from Yunhai 749 today.\"\n\n\"Later, when Lu Ding became famous, I was afraid your Ninth Junior Brother couldn't handle him, so I talked to your Sixth Junior Brother instead.\"\n\n\"A while ago, Lu Ding assisted Li Xuanlong in slaying Shi Gandang, so I switched to your Third Junior Brother again.\"\n\n\"Just now, I sensed his cultivation was even stronger than rumored. Your Third Junior Brother isn't reliable either. You go. Challenge him, defeat him. As long as you defeat him, I'm confident I can negotiate our Qi Sword Sect's allocated resources higher.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man couldn't help it; he himself found it amusing as he spoke, switching candidates again and again, having to be a bit shameless.\n\nLu Ding appeared out of thin air and grew rapidly, like wind.\n\nThis made it so his plans could never keep up with the changes.\n\nBut thankfully, he still had this senior disciple to be the finale.\n\nXu Zui, thirty-four years old, cultivating for over ten years, at the fourth stage of the Divine Palace Realm*, with good talent and diligent, but a bit arrogant. Outsiders nicknamed him \"Drunken Sword.\"\n\nThe first reason was his name contained \"Zui\" (drunk). The second reason was that his thought process was like someone drunk.\n\nListening to his master's words, Xu Zui nodded and said: \"Master, don't worry. If we were to agree on a duel, and he had that move he used to accumulate power, the one that almost sliced Shi Gandang in half, I would surely die ten times over.\"\n\n\"But now, the incident is sudden. There's no way he'll get a chance to accumulate power. What's his cultivation level?\"\n\nQi Sword Sect Master: \"Below Divine Palace, I am certain!\"\n\n\"What's my cultivation level?\"\n\nQi Sword Sect Master: \"Divine Palace Fourth Stage, personally taught by me!\"\n\n\"Although he has the record of slaying Liu Xingchuan, a Divine Palace First Stage, it was a sneak attack. I am stronger than Liu Xingchuan by more than just a little bit.\"\n\n\"Below Divine Palace, even if he's at the ninth stage of the Spirit Sea Realm*, facing me at Divine Palace Fourth Stage, this is...\"\n\nThe two exchanged a glance, and in unison said: \"The advantage is with me!\" x2\n\n---\n*   **Fast-tracked (保送):** In this context, it refers to direct entry or guaranteed admission into a position/company without having to go through a competitive recruitment process.\n*   **Sī Mìng Realm (司命境):** A cultivation realm or stage of power.\n*   **Yaodu (妖都):** Translates to \"Monster Capital\" or \"Demon City,\" likely a significant location for powerful beings.\n*   **Scholar-Warrior Sleeves (文武袖):** A specific type of attire, likely symbolic of both scholarly and martial prowess.\n*   **Neither a scholar nor a warrior, yet you wear Scholar-Warrior Sleeves (文不成武不就，你還穿個文武袖):** This is a play on an idiom, \"文不成武不就,\" which means someone is good for nothing or cannot achieve in either literary or martial arts. The phrase sarcastically implies the wearer is undeserving of such symbolic attire.\n*   **Baby Cup (寶寶杯):** A humorous and somewhat demeaning name for the tournament, implying it's for less formidable participants.\n*   **Divine Palace Realm (神宮四重):** A cultivation realm or stage of power, specifically the fourth stage of the Divine Palace.\n*   **Spirit Sea Realm (靈海九重):** A cultivation realm or stage of power, specifically the ninth stage of the Spirit Sea.",

    "content": ".....\n\nXu Zui straightened his back and raised his head, his gaze sweeping towards Lu Ding, who was chatting and laughing with Director Deng not far away.\n\nA sense of untamed arrogance burned in his eyes.\n\nThe Qi Sword Sect Master’s allocated resources referred to heavenly materials, earthly treasures, and other cultivation supplies.\n\nA long, long time ago, 749 established a series of rules and regulations to manage Qi refiners and delineate the boundaries between Qi refiners and ordinary people.\n\nAnd stipulated that Qi refiners could not survive by enslaving ordinary people for sustenance.\n\nThis led to Qi refiners living much worse than before, but ordinary people gradually developed.\n\nAs for what role ordinary people played before: testing medicine, gathering herbs, planting herbs, farming, opening mountains, mining—too many to count......\n\nThe authorities annihilated a group that showed no remorse or change, and left behind a group that was honest and hadn't committed major mistakes. They brought in resources from all over the country, provided technology, reformed soil, offered spiritual seeds, and so on, whether it was having them participate in planting herbs or developing magical artifacts.\n\nOr other things, you retain your heritage.\n\nAnyway, I will hand over some basic technologies and raw materials to you, or you can use your existing things; I will only provide you with materials, I don't care, you do it. If you produce something, we'll share the profits proportionally.\n\nEven many good things that aren't available here and must be obtained from other places, 749 is also willing to provide. Of course, certainly not core ones.\n\nJust like this, many smaller heritages developed even better than before.\n\nAs for those large heritages, large? Can you be larger than the Great Han? In this circle, if you jump around and cause trouble, we'll play it slow, after all, many matters involve the broader picture and cannot be pushed to extremes.\n\nMany things need to be considered.\n\nBut if you step out of a certain boundary, I'll directly send powerful experts to clear the way, followed by cannons, nuclear bombs to flatten the area, and various weapons blending technology and metaphysics to slip through the cracks.\n\nAlthough these weapons can't kill your formidable strong experts, if all your corrupt disciples are slaughtered, your heritage will pretty much come to an end, with a gap in succession.*\n\nAnnihilation is only a matter of time.\n\nThen, we'll capture your strong experts one by one and sever their lineage.\n\nEvery year, every place, every region will have a large batch of allocated resources, which includes various items. Then, based on the completion rate of each faction's business volume in the previous year, the allocation for the next year is divided.\n\nIn recent years, the Qi Sword Sect itself was incompetent, yet felt that the official allocation was too little.\n\nIn the beginning, everyone had similar allocations; at most, there were some differences based on the varying strengths, foundations, and areas of expertise of each sect.\n\nBut gradually, later on.\n\nWe give the Qi Sword Sect 10,000 jin** of seeds obtained from various sources. Others give me 200,000 units of goods for 10,000 jin of seeds, but you give me 8,000. And it's not 8,000 just one year, it's 8,000 every year, sometimes 7,000.\n\nSo, I shouldn't reduce your allocation?\n\nWeren't those 2,000 seeds wasted then? Where did they go?\n\nI give you things, and you pull this stunt on me. You don't even have a diamond drill, yet I'm giving you porcelain work.***\n\nRather than engaging in crooked ways and wanting to gain bargaining chips through challenges, it's better to think about how to improve efficiency.\n\nMore work, more gain—everyone is like this. From the root to the policy, not a single one is targeting you.\n\nNow you think 749's distribution is unfair and still want to cause trouble?\n\nLu Ding felt that unfriendly gaze.\n\nHe asked Director Deng, who was beside him.\n\nThe old man had explained it to him in this manner from above.\n\n\"So, his peacocking**** behavior is to challenge me, wanting to take a shortcut, not considering his own ability, yet wanting more allocation, then unable to meet the numbers, leading to a vicious cycle, continuing next time?\"\n\nThe old man smiled kindly.\n\n\"It won't be a vicious cycle,\" he said. \"If you can think of it, others can think of it too. There are ways to deal with it.\"\n\n\"This is within the rules we allow. Heaven and Earth are vast, and a hundred flowers should bloom, just like you said, a hundred boats competing for the flow.\"\n\n\"The world of Qi refiners should have everything. If 749 becomes the sole dominant power, with less competition and no external stimulation, in the long run, we will only let our horses graze on the southern mountains and put away our swords and spears*****.\"\n\n\"749's objective is to protect all stability and peace, so that ordinary people and Qi refiners can both prosper in stable times, maintaining as much balance as possible, and not letting ordinary people re-tread the path they came from.\"\n\n\"You can view sects as ancient aristocratic families that aren't necessarily all bad seeds, but there are definitely bad seeds among them. While most of 749's investigators are from humble backgrounds, or ordinary common folk.\"\n\n\"We understand, we tolerate, but we are also iron-blooded. Those who try to destroy stability and break order aren't necessarily all demons and monsters; there will also be people among them.\"\n\nLu Ding quietly listened through the entire explanation.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said. \"Since that's the case, I need to go make him realize reality.\"\n\nWhat kind of appetite determines what kind of bowl you get. If you can't eat it, yet still take and serve more, has no one taught you to cherish food?\n\nAs for waiting until after the Three-District Martial Arts Tournament ends?\n\nLu Ding couldn't wait even a little. While peacocking**** is indeed beautiful, only the person directly facing it knows: Dammit, a beast is a beast; it shits and won't wipe.\n\nTo others' eyes, Xu Zui cast a gaze towards Lu Ding; it was the scrutiny of a powerful expert towards a newly risen strong talent.\n\nBut from Lu Ding's perspective, this person was purely looking for trouble!!\n\nThis kind of person, you should just make him lie down directly!\n\n\"Remember to call for the opening when it's over.\"\n\nThese words were from Director Chu.\n\n\"Okay, Director Chu,\" Lu Ding replied, then stood up.\n\nHe walked over under everyone's watchful eyes.\n\nThose disciples from the Qi Sword Sect in the back rows of the viewing area whispered one after another.\n\n\"Senior Brother, he's here, he's here!!\"\n\n\"Lu Ding is here, he's here! Senior Brother, go for it, so many people are watching.\"\n\n\"Senior Brother, your aura, your aura! Your gaze, your gaze needs to be on point.\"\n\n\"We can't let others look down on us, Senior Brother!\"\n\nXu Zui held his head high and puffed out his chest. When Lu Ding walked over, he immediately spoke: \"Lu Ding, right, you.......\"\n\n\"Alright, I don't want to hear any of your meaningless drivel. Now, immediately, right now, go down and fight. There's an open spot. The old routine for openings has lost its novelty; let's use our battle to open today's Three-District Martial Arts Tournament.\"\n\nXu Zui's mind couldn't quite process it.\n\nHe was arrogant, but in front of so many other sect leaders and 749's leadership, even if he was arrogant, he still had to restrain himself a bit.\n\nBut Lu Ding showed no restraint whatsoever.\n\nNow, with just one sentence from Lu Ding, he was put in an awkward position, unable to back down, completely bypassing protocol.\n\nNormally speaking, one would definitely first walk out, display one's demeanor and sect upbringing, then say a line like, \"749 truly produces many talented individuals...... Today I.......\"\n\n—with hundreds of words omitted in between—then the top few from the 749 First Year Martial Arts Tournament would begin to enter the arena.\n\nBut Lu Ding went straight to the point, directly skipping it all.\n\nYou want to fight?\n\nThen fight!\n\nHe hadn't even said anything yet.\n\n\"Is your brain tied in a knot, thinking for so long? This is the viewing platform, and I'm not too keen on ruining the atmosphere. Now I'll count to three, just three. If after three counts you're still looking like a dazed goose, don't blame me if I smack you right here!\"\n\n---\n*   \"青黃不接\" (qīnghuángbùjiē) literally means \"yellow and green do not connect,\" referring to a period of shortage when the old crop is exhausted and the new one is not yet ready, or metaphorically, a generation gap where the old hasn't been replaced by the new.\n**  A jin (斤) is a traditional Chinese unit of weight, equivalent to 500 grams or about 1.1 pounds.\n*** This refers to the idiom \"沒有金剛鑽，別攬瓷器活兒\" (méiyǒu jīngāng zuàn, bié lǎn cíqì huó'er), meaning \"if you don't have a diamond drill, don't undertake porcelain work.\" It implies that one should not take on a task for which they are not qualified.

    "content": ".....\n\nThey were all leaders, so Lu Ding still had to be a bit restrained, but this person wasn't focused, and his mind seemed to have flown away to somewhere unknown.\n\nSkipping those unnecessary steps, is it really that hard to understand?\n\nYou know what you want to do, I know what you want to do, so wouldn't it be enough to just let everyone know what you want to do?\n\nIf this weren't the viewing platform of the Three Districts Martial Arts Tournament, Lu Ding would have started with zero-frame execution long ago.\n\nTalking to you about this?\n\nStill want to follow procedures?\n\nXu Zui only felt as if he had fallen into Lu Ding's rhythm. This was like an argument; once you fell into someone else's rhythm, you'd overheat.\n\nLu Ding was arrogant, as if he, Xu Zui, wasn't arrogant. He wanted to show it!!\n\n\"You......\"\n\nHe still wanted to say something when Lu Ding's punch flew straight forward, bringing up a whoosh of wind, with faint circular and swirling air currents rapidly passing from his fist peak over his arm and then dissipating.\n\nXu Zui raised his hand to his chest to block.\n\nAlthough he had long known in his heart that Lu Ding's physical body was terrifying, he never, ever expected it to be this terrifying.\n\nIt was like knowing a moving vehicle would carry great force, but when it had just started, the tires hadn't even completed a single revolution—how much force could that be?\n\nThen you took a hit, your shin fractured, and turned black and blue all over.\n\nXu Zui at that moment was just like this.\n\nHis hand blocked in front of his chest, but Lu Ding's punch fractured both his chest and hand together.\n\nXu Zui flew backward, intense pain followed. He looked at his chest, which was caved in. Just as he wanted to feel it with his hand, he looked at his hand again: his palm was sunken, the bones on the back of his hand protruded, and his fingers were twisted and deformed.\n\nIt had already become a chicken claw.\n\nCirculating Qi into the injury, under the writhing of bones and muscles, the injuries gradually recovered.\n\n\"Didn't you count to three!?\"\n\nHe again fell into Lu Ding's rhythm.\n\n\"I didn't say I would count them for you.\"\n\nXu Zui was stuck again.\n\nThe Qi Sword Sect Master, sitting to the side, seeing that the situation wasn't following the usual routine, wondered how they had started fighting up there.\n\nGazes from around and from below the arena were all cast over.\n\nEven though he had a relatively thick skin, he couldn't block the gazes of the crowd, which turned into a barrage of bullets and splashed over like water.\n\n\"They've already taken the initiative to speak, what are you still doing here, get down!\"\n\n\"Go to the center of the arena and respectfully await Investigator Lu's brilliant move!\"\n\nXu Zui leaped into the air and went down to the arena.\n\nLu Ding followed closely behind, flying away; moving later than him, yet arriving before him.\n\nXu Zui was unconvinced in his heart, 'My Divine Palace can't even perform this kind of flying secret art, how can you, a Spirit Sea, know it?'\n\nThe focus of the audience instantly shifted to the ring below.\n\n\"Xu Zui of the Qi Sword Sect? He's fighting Lu Ding? Didn't he cultivate for ten or twenty years? That's not right, is it?\"\n\n\"Why not?! That's right, Lu Ding should fight people like him.\"\n\n\"Cultivating for a long time doesn't necessarily mean one is powerful; even a snapping turtle* lives a long time.\"\n\nYinlu Mountain viewing platform.\n\nThe girl, her hair tied into buns on each side, watched the two in the arena and couldn't help but say, \"That's too much. I don't know much about Lu Ding, but I know he only recently became famous, right?\"\n\n\"And he's so~ young.\"\n\n\"That Xu Zui, he's been famous for so long, and he's even Divine Palace Fourth Stage. How could he have the nerve? This is bullying the small by the big.\"\n\nThe gentle woman held her, her eyes, like cut water, slightly curved her brow and eyes: \"He's different from others. If we talk about seniority, Lu Ding is like those investigative officers undergoing assessment below. But if we talk about strength, only the previous generation can compare to him.\"\n\n\"For us Qi cultivators, we value strength more, not age, so no one thinks Xu Zui is doing anything wrong.\"\n\n\"As for bullying the small by the big, no one present considers Lu Ding a junior like those investigative officers below.\"\n\n\"Everyone thinks this is the right way.\"\n\n\"They even view Xu Zui as the challenger.\"\n\nThe little girl quickly looked left and right, then asked, \"Senior Sister, what is Lu Ding's cultivation realm?\"\n\n\"I don't know, it should be Spirit Sea, I guess. I can't be sure either. If he were Divine Palace, Xu Zui might really be drunk today.\"\n\nNow the little girl understood.\n\n'Others are Divine Palace, fighting Lu Ding, a Spirit Sea—that's reasonable.'\n\n'Others are Divine Palace, fighting Lu Ding, a Divine Palace—that's not reasonable.'\n\nThe girl tilted her head and suddenly thought of something, and let out a giggle: \"I understand, Senior Sister, Lu Ding's realms are all 'plus' versions; everyone else's are 'normal' and 'S,' he's 'plus.'\"\n\n\"That's great, you've been working hard in class recently.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThe girl's expression was proud.\n\nSuddenly, a human voice shouted for the opening, the voice was passionate and clear, followed by saluting cannons that vibrated the earth.\n\nCheers soared throughout the air.\n\nThe girl shivered in fright and subconsciously turned her head, ready to watch the battle, but when she looked, Xu Zui was embedded in the wall, head slumped, unconscious.\n\nLu Ding stood in fresh clothes, arms wide open. Behind him, a towering mountain rose from flat ground, steep as if cleaved by an axe.\n\nThe girl's gaze and expression were instantly swept up by various emotions: bewilderment, doubt, adoration.\n\n\"Senior Sister, he's so handsome.......\"\n\n\"Huh? It's over? How did it end already? Waaah, I didn't even see it. From now on, I'll never talk too much again when watching his fights, waaah.......\"\n\nIt turned out that just moments ago.\n\nThe two landed.\n\nXu Zui had just landed his rear foot, and before his feet were steady, he said, \"I won't give you a chance to charge up that move.\"\n\nAt the same time, he secretly thought to himself, 'I've also prepared to deal with your physical body.'\n\nThis time he had learned to be a bit smarter, and was circulating Qi as he spoke. The Qi Sword Sect uses Qi to form swords, possesses unique Qi cultivation methods, and can train the technique of 'no sword is better than having a sword.'\n\nNot only could hands condense Qi into swords.\n\nA glance, a movement, even the acupoints on his body, could freely form swords.\n\nEncompassing his entire body, 365 degrees, with no blind spots, for long-range and close-quarters combat, without a single flaw.\n\nHe knew Lu Ding's physical body was strong, so, as soon as Lu Ding got close to him, the acupoints all over his body would erupt with Qi swords.\n\n'Wouldn't you be stabbed into a hedgehog then?' Xu Zui's thoughts were as above.\n\nLu Ding's actions were as follows.\n\nHe raised his hand and snapped his fingers with a crisp sound, \"Snap.\"\n\nSix black coffin planks, emanating a decaying smell, materialized, locking together out of thin air, tightly and seamlessly.\n\nIn the darkness, Xu Zui panicked, and in the blink of an eye, he poured out his full strength without reservation. A corner of the black coffin shattered. He thought this was due to his own mighty strength.\n\nLittle did he know.\n\nThe shattered part happened to reveal his head; it was intentionally done by Lu Ding.\n\nXu Zui saw light again, but it would have been better if he hadn't, because Lu Ding, carrying a surging aura, had charged close without him knowing when.\n\nHis right hand swung a punch parallel to his shoulder behind him, his left hand opened a palm in front of his body.\n\nBetween the pulling of the palm and the pushing of the fist.\n\nBehind him, an aura faintly condensed into a form: a ferocious bear beast with blood-stained fur, baring its fangs and claws, tore through the barrier between illusion and reality, and slapped down with a palm, carrying the force of pushing a mountain.\n\n\"Sleep!!\"\n\nIn the illusion, a palm strike hit; in reality, a punch struck directly.\n\nBang!!!\n\nXu Zui's lingering thought before his consciousness went offline was: 'Lights out?'\n\nThe punch hit, the immense force carried Xu Zui's body, shattering the black coffin. His body flailed wildly in the air, flipping end over end, finally smashing into the wall and getting embedded.\n\nA dull thud sounded.\n\nBlack coffin fragments scattered in the air.\n\nLu Ding spread his arms, the Wind Stabilizing Art was quietly cast. Under the surging of his aura, rushing white air currents spread to both sides, brushing over the heads of all the Martial Arts Tournament investigative officers.\n\n\"Opening!!!!\"\n\n---\n*  **Snapping turtle:** *Wang Ba* (王八) literally means \"snapping turtle,\" but can also be used as a derogatory term.

Steepness is just an additional condition\n\nOnce you climb up, you will be trapped by various illusions, hindering you from moving forward, slamming you for seeking the truth, and slandering you for executing your mission.\n\nPossible rights, fame and fortune, beauty, brother, money, family and other problems\n\nOr the decision of conscience, the judgment of good and evil\n\nWhether it is seeking the truth or having a strong professional ethics\n\nA person's life is climbing mountains. If he doesn't pay attention to a step, he will fall to a deep and deep slump.\n\nYou can stop and rest, but you can't stop moving forward because time passes. When you stop at the same time, others will surpass you to achieve better results\n\nWatching the atmosphere come back\n\nEven more than before, or to put it, there has never been a region of the first year of Wu, and there has been an atmosphere like today.\n\nThis is a prosperous situation before\n\nThe other leaders who were not very happy before, now the smile on their faces is getting worse because they saw their new investigator's attitude.\n\nIt's because of the strong pressure. Mom, the old bastard named Chu is still next to you.\n\nHe can't laugh at it\n\n\"Old Chu, I will lend me the cauldron for a while in the future. I think we, the 749th man, also need a person like this. He is not the kind of genius in traditional meaning. You know, he.\"\n\nSpeaking of this, the leader of the Yaodu 749 sounded a voice, and his expressions were filled with a bunch of people, and he couldn't think of language to describe it.\n\n\"He is just a person who is very special and difficult to evaluate in language.\"\n\nOne of the demons behind him is well-informed. The female investigator covered her mouth and smiled slightly, and a voice reminded: \"Leader, personal charm.\"\n\n\"For the right, personal charm\"\n\nThe leader of Qingzhou next to him also came\n\n\"He is arrogant and arrogant, but he is not arrogant.\"\n\nThe leader of Qingsheng thought with his eyes: \"I don't know if it's my illusion. I always think that when he faces the enemy, he will not treat him differently, whether it's strong or weak.\"\n\n\"He looks down on them.\"\n\nIn this sentence, Qingsheng Leader said that he wanted to laugh when he said that he looked down on every enemy equally\n\nIf you look down on me, I will get angry, but if you look down on everyone, that's fine. Anyway, it's not like me. I can't beat you, we can't beat you, then we'll be the same if we open you.Or online\n\nLogically closed, perfect\n\n\"But he started out badly, he was reliable in his work, his thinking style was special, reasonable and legal, but he was not very suitable.\"\n\nThe leader of the demon capital replenishes again\n\nPeople think that such a person is most suitable to bring an atmosphere and stimulate other people to grow. You can't see his growth process because he has no growth process.\n\nEvery day is a real beginning of meaning\n\nSo if you are beaten by him, you will not want to follow his steps\n\nWhen everyone was beaten by him, you all were running online again, looking like they were throwing a broken can\n\nIn fact, indirectly, those who were in that volume were all very bad and all were appreciative.\n\nIt's really exciting\n\nJust like the ones above the mountain peaks at this time, Xue Ning, Wen Ruchu, Yan Feifan, etc.\n\nTheir talents are actually very good. Yan Feifan may be a little different, but the problem is not big. This is not a test of the practical talents.\n\nAfter these people were stimulated by the tripod, this mountain climbing thought that it should not be too simple.\n\nFacing old friends, turning into demons\n\nXue Ning lifted the gun and stabbed it\n\n\"You have become a demon, I won't make you suffer.\"\n\nFacing parents who are being held back by demons\n\nWen Ruchu was silent and walked forward\n\nThen it suddenly exploded and a sword cut his head: \"Have anyone told you that if you talk too much, you will miss the opportunity.\"\n\nAs for Yan Feifan, he has been with the Dao Ding for the longest time, so in this regard he is most similar to the Dao Ding, and he killed him.\n\nThe test of mind and nature cannot explain anything, but with the same talent, it must be such a person, and it is even more liked by 749.\n\nThe eye-catching performances of these people instantly attracted several leaders to see them. The eyes were filled with appreciation, and I wanted to drag this Yunhai 749 investigator home, right?\n\nAfter all, the changes of these people were all because of the lunar calendar.\n\nAs for why they know\n\nIsn't this a waste? I've beaten my own genius like this and don't understand it yet. I really don't need to fuck you\n\nThe tripod returns to the side of the seat\n\nXu Zui, who was hit by him with a punch, was also brought back, but he was a little bit awkward.\n\nI'll wake up for a while and come\n\nThe door owner of Qi Jianmen, whose expression was solidified like ice, was sealed by the dark coffin from Xu Zui with a move from the tripod.\n\nHis expression didn't change\n\nThis is his most devastating disciple. The fourth level of the Shen Palace to attack the Spirit Sea Realm, what can you defeat and what can you defeat and what can you defeat and you can't defeat.\n\nIf you can't beat it, just forget it\n\nHe was killed and lost such a big face in seconds\n\nThe man thought, and suddenly, he felt like something was on his mind.\n\nStop looking\n\nThe little old man beside the Ding looked at him at some point, his body was not moving, but his brain turned a different arc and stared at the Qi Sword Door Master.\n\nAt this moment, the horns have a specific explanation of the appearance of the wolf.\n\nThe man who looked at him was furious behind his back, but he didn't dare to hide his eyes.\n\nMr. Dun raised his hand, his thumb and index finger were scratched in a curve\n\nThe man cooperates and smiles on his face\n\nService from sexual tests passed√\n\nAfter seeing this scene, Mr. Dun turned slowly and showed a kind smile as before.\n\nIf you want to make trouble, I let you do it. You are still unhappy now. Do you think I gave you a face?Although Mr. Dun didn't know if this Qi Sword would have any thoughts, it was always good to knock on these things that happened today.\n\nYou should pick out the bad seeds. If you can't see them on the outside, just pinch them.\n\nDon't wait until he gets hurt before you react, it's too late\n\n\"Old\"\n\nHe is old now, no matter how old he was. Although the furnace was extinguished, he did not anneale.\n\nOld Dun was moved and heard the sound of the lunar calendar, and he was slightly beside him: \"Don't say that it's too late, it's still cloudy and sky.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\n\nThe little old man's smile is calm and penetrating\n\nBai Yumian has one hand and one hand and is a hand and a hand. He has just heard it clearly.\n\nSuddenly, on the mountain of Jingxin, a figure moved to the top, pulled out the colorful flag, looked at the high flag and said, \"Brother Ru, I'm not a waste anymore.\"\n\nAt this moment, Yan Feifan's eyes were red, and Si Chang seemed to have returned to the day when he first met the Ding.\n\nHe opened the car and said that he was denied himself, \"Really, Brother Lu, I am actually a waste. I can't fight and fight, I can't investigate and nothing, and the assessment is all over the past.\"\n\nOthers say he is cowardly, talent is useless, and he can't swim, only the Ding will show him wise\n\nHe said he would not fight, he never once had a fight in this period of time.\n\nIf others bully him, the Ding will help him directly\n\nYan Feifan knew that someone outside said that he was the dog of the Ding, so he would take whatever he wanted.\n\nThoughtful, if you don’t think about martial arts, he is standing here today, not trying to prove anything, he just wants to say, even if I am a dog, I live like a human being than you.",

    "content": "Watching Yan Feifan at the mountaintop.\n\nLu Ding never thought he was trash.\n\nIt's just that he wasn't inclined towards combat.\n\nAs Yan Feifan reached the summit, more and more people obtained colored flags at various heights on the mountain.\n\nAmong them, the investigators from Cloudsea 749 obtained the highest quality flags.\n\nWith the Contest of Heart concluded, next were the Contest of Insight and the Contest of Martial Arts.\n\nInsight is comprehension; Martial Arts is strength.\n\nA picture album was displayed, showing a crimson mountain of flesh surging. Lu Ding glanced at it and gained some insight.\n\nBut he wasn't very interested.\n\nThis thing was similar to his 'Living Exuviae, Living Birth' ability.\n\nBut its effect wasn't as strong as 'Living Exuviae, Living Birth'.\n\nThe spell within it, once comprehended, could regrow flesh and bone. It was a relatively useful spell, after all, having a means to quickly recover from injuries when fighting demons outside could save one's life at a critical moment.\n\nThe key point was injury recovery.\n\nAs for Lu Ding's 'Living Exuviae, Living Birth', wherever he was injured, he'd tear it, and with one rip and pull, it'd be good as new.\n\nIf that didn't work, he'd vomit himself.\n\nDirectly full-health resurrection, \"Hi hi hi, I'm back!\" The enemies would instantly feel despair.\n\nTherefore, Lu Ding disliked the 'regrow flesh and bone' spell for its insufficient efficiency.\n\nIf someone were to provoke him a few words, Lu Ding wouldn't mind putting on a show.\n\nUnfortunately, there was no one.\n\nEveryone present knew that all the spells he knew were perfected. With such an example before them, would you compare insight with him?\n\nUnless you haven't had enough setbacks.\n\nIn this round, Shangguan Qing from Demon City and a young genius from Qing Province tied for first place, with identical enlightenment times and spell completeness.\n\nAs for the third round, the \"Baby Cup\" battles, Lu Ding found them a bit dull.\n\nHe couldn't go down to bully the weak.\n\nFinally, the rankings came out. Excluding him and Bai Hemian, there were seven spots: Cloudsea took three (Wen Ruchu, Tantai Xianyue, Xue Ning), Demon City took two (Shangguan Qing and a girl carrying a greatsword), and Qing Province took two (Lu Ding didn't know them, one male and one female).\n\nThis was equivalent to these two places each giving a spot to Lu Ding and Bai Hemian.\n\nLOL.\n\nAs for Yan Feifan, his performance in the second and third rounds was mediocre. Not everyone can develop rapidly in a short period.\n\nHis mindset had changed, but his hard strength required time to grow.\n\nBut his performance in the first round shocked many. Director Chu looked at Yan Feifan, then at Lu Ding, and couldn't help but ponder.\n\n\"This mindset, this IQ and EQ, is quite suitable for management...\"\n\nThinking of this, Director Chu couldn't help but recall the scene where Yan Feifan led the cheering and applause on the day of the meeting, and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.\n\nNight.\n\nThe Tri-Region Martial Arts Contest concluded successfully.\n\nIn the Cloudsea 749 conference room.\n\nThree investigators, bearing crescent moon shoulder insignias, were each looking at the documents in their hands and smiling.\n\nSomeone began.\n\n\"The Tri-Region Martial Arts Contest has produced two guaranteed admissions; this is a first in history.\"\n\n\"There are monsters hidden among geniuses; it's not in vain that we prepared lavish gifts for them.\"\n\n\"And, coincidentally, give them an opportunity to resolve trouble.\"\n\nThe three spoke one after another until the conference room door was knocked upon.\n\nThe nine individuals selected for advanced training, led by Lu Ding, walked in.\n\nThey took their respective seats, each marked with their nameplate.\n\nAfter the nine of them were seated.\n\nThe three investigators bearing crescent moon insignias got to the point.\n\n\"Let me introduce myself. My name is Lu Ting, one of the instructors at the advanced training facility, and I'm here to take you there.\"\n\n\"Ran Jing, one of the instructors at the advanced training facility.\"\n\n\"Wu Beifeng, one of the instructors at the advanced training facility.\"\n\nAfter the three had introduced themselves.\n\nLu Ting picked up a small cardboard box nearby and said, \"Three regions, thirty spots. The top nine will receive advanced training, and the remaining twenty-one will receive rewards.\"\n\n\"Although advanced training is also a reward, what others have, you must also have.\"\n\n\"I believe you all know about the custom of 'welcome gifts' for advanced training investigators, right?\"\n\nLu Ding only learned this information after completing the 'Night of Hundred Ghosts'.\n\nNo wonder, as he had only joined 749 a short time ago.\n\nThe welcome gifts at the advanced training facility were prepared generously, but there was a precondition: they've prepared it for you, but you have to go get it yourself. Of course, you can refuse it; after all, advanced training is also a reward.\n\nBut if you want it.\n\nThis welcome gift isn't so easy to get.\n\nThe cardboard box held by the instructor contained envelopes corresponding to each person's name, sealed with the location of each individual's advanced training welcome gift.\n\nIncluding but not limited to, on a formidable demon or monster, or on a wanted Qi Refiner, or in a forbidden area of a certain sect, or in a terrifying deep mountain forest, and so on...\n\nWant it? Go get it.\n\nAs for whether it's dangerous, that depends on your luck and strength.\n\nEveryone was aware of this situation, but no one moved. Their gaze subconsciously fell upon Lu Ding.\n\nYet Lu Ding showed no movement whatsoever.\n\nHe was arrogant, but that didn't mean his brain was filled only with arrogance. According to convention and classic logic.\n\nExceptional people like him and Bai Hemian would certainly receive special treatment.\n\nSince it was special treatment, the process would be beyond Lu Ding's control.\n\nTo be an instructor proved that they weren't dunderheads. They must have investigated him beforehand, especially after learning of his combat strength.\n\nLu Ding's welcome gift would definitely be hellishly difficult to obtain.\n\nIt wasn't impossible for him to face a Fate Realm cultivator alone.\n\nLu Ding knew himself well; he couldn't win, certainly couldn't win, unless he fought to the death. But would he be alright if he fought to the death for no reason?\n\nHe had a cheat code<sup>1</sup>; wouldn't it be better to just honestly go for advanced training?\n\nWhy worry about not developing?\n\nIf it really didn't work out, he just wouldn't do the advanced training. Although Cloudsea was a large human city, the quality of demons and monsters was a bit lacking, and their numbers had decreased a bit after the Ghost Festival, but they weren't completely eradicated.\n\nWhat if he accumulated small amounts over time?\n\nIt's best if he can do the advanced training, but it's fine if he can't.\n\nAs a result, Lu Ding held this unhurried mindset. After a while, Lu Ting grew restless; he was anxious.\n\nHe felt like a clown, ignored by everyone.\n\nEspecially Lu Ding, who was completely different from what he had imagined.\n\nLu Ting's mind was racing.\n\n\"No, aren't you tempted!?\"\n\n\"You, such an awesome genius, who outclassed the geniuses of the three regions, you don't show any reaction?\"\n\n\"You need to perk up!!\"\n\n\"Do you have to be so rational?\"\n\n\"At a time like this, shouldn't you be the first to stand up and, in a calm tone, say, 'Can I have a few more copies'?\"\n\n\"And then I'd tell you, wait until you get the first one.\"\n\n\"But now you're pulling this stunt on me!?\"\n\n\"Alright, rational, huh? I don't believe you're not tempted.\"\n\nThe more he thought, the angrier Lu Ting became. He took out the envelope with Lu Ding's name on it: \"Cough, cough, Lu Ding, as a guaranteed admission genius, you have 'special privileges'. You can listen first, then decide.\"\n\n\"Special privileges,\" he added later.\n\nLu Ding: \"Thank you, leader.\"\n\n\"And damn polite, too.\"\n\nLu Ting tore open the envelope: \"Given your past grudge with Black Mountain, your welcome gift is currently lying quietly in the deepest part of Black Wind Cave in Black Mountain, waiting for you.\"\n\nAs he read to this point, Lu Ting glanced at Lu Ding. He was just about to continue.\n\nLu Ding's voice rang out: \"Leader, what's the cultivation level of Black Mountain's strongest Qi Refiner?\"\n\nIf you talked about other places, Lu Ding might not go, but if you talked about Black Mountain, then he had to go.\n\nNow Lu Ding was about to leave. He had to completely resolve the matters in Cloudsea. He wasn't afraid of Black Mountain coming after him.\n\n\"Don't like it? Let's fight!\"\n\nBut Yan Feifan would remain in Cloudsea.\n\nThey both did it together. Lu Ding got to make a show of it, but now that he was leaving, he couldn't let Yan Feifan stay behind to bear unknown risks.\n\nIf people from Black Mountain came down to retaliate and couldn't find Lu Ding, they would vent their anger on Yan Feifan. Isn't that how villains are written in novels?\n\nYan Feifan was one of his few friends. The two collaborated, with Yan Feifan running errands, doing odd jobs, and writing drafts, even creating opportunities for Lu Ding to show off. Even without today's welcome gift incident, Lu Ding would have dealt with Black Mountain as soon as possible.\n\nNow that it coincided, there's no time like the present. Let's do it!\n\nLu Ting shot a glance. He hadn't reacted before, but hearing \"Black Mountain\" was like getting a shot of adrenaline. \"You kid, you're truly vengeful.\"\n\nHe replied with a firm answer: \"Fate Realm First Level, but he's old.\"\n\nLu Ding: 'Living Exuviae, Living Birth' can finally be put to use.\n\nHe fiddled with his phone for a moment.\n\nLu Ting saw him open the 749 APP's investigator privileges interface and then select plane tickets. He asked, puzzled, \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm booking a plane ticket to Black Mountain.\"\n***\n<sup>1</sup> 'Golden finger' (金手指, jīnfíngzhǐ): A common trope in Chinese web novels referring to a cheat, special ability, or power-up that gives the protagonist an unfair advantage.",

    "content": "The atmosphere in the room instantly quieted.\n\n“You’re booking a flight to Mount Hei? No? If you’re not going, you’re not going. But if you are, you book a flight immediately? Is your efficiency that high?”\n\n“You don’t have to be in such a hurry. You can rest first, then...”\n\n“No need, I’m not tired. Being idle is just being idle. Better to get things done early and start training early.” Lu Ding said, his flight already booked. He stood up and took the envelope from Lü Ting's hand, saying, “Thank you, leader.”\n\nSeeing Lu Ding take the envelope, the others showed no hesitation, all indicating they also wanted the training reward.\n\nThis training reward, while dangerous, certainly wouldn't exceed their own capabilities. You might not be able to win, but you wouldn't be unable to escape. The probability of injury, however, was very high, almost reaching ninety-nine percent, and there was a thrill of dancing on the tip of a knife. A sapling that finally emerged, you couldn’t possibly snap it yourself before it even had a chance to grow, could you? So, the training ground couldn't possibly create something that would lead people to their deaths.\n\nThere was an element of gambling, but the consequences wouldn't be unbearable. As long as someone took the lead, this training reward wouldn't be taken by just one person.\n\nBut!\n\nHere’s the key point! It’s true that not only one person would choose the training reward, but it’s also rare for people from *all three districts* to choose it.\n\nAnd!\n\nWhat the hell are you all doing booking tickets?! Are you in such a hurry? Can't you rest first and go tomorrow!? Don't follow Lu Ding in everything.\n\nOriginally, he was supposed to go through the motions, telling these talents to work hard, to be diligent, about the mission they carried—whether it was for their own pursuit of the Tao or the responsibility they should fulfill by wearing this uniform.\n\nInstead.\n\nThey immediately got competitive. Without you even saying anything, they were more diligent, more hardworking, and more efficient than you imagined. Absolutely no unnecessary rest, not even a bit. If we say we'll do it, we'll do it. Two dots and a force make 'handle', two horizontals and a vertical make 'do it'!!*\n\nAnd you wouldn't hear any nonsense or various inexplicable questions. In the past, when he went to other major districts for this training reward segment, the atmosphere was always relaxed first, then he would lead it into silence. Now, this segment that omitted the relaxed part and went straight to silence made these three instructors feel awkward, extremely awkward, yet you couldn't find fault. You couldn't possibly do something unreasonable, could you?\n\nSuddenly, Lü Ting thought of something. Once Lu Ding resolves the Mount Hei issue and enters the training ground, then... there'll likely be a good show to watch.\n\nHe heard that this time, the Eastern Major District had a genius who opened his spiritual channels by finding a Jing Dynasty imperial seal, incredibly arrogant; and from the Northwest, a girl blessed by the Eternal Sky; and from the Northeast Major District, the second master of the Bai branch of the Liu family descending the mountain as a 'Walker'. The Twelve Caves of the Southwest... the Inherited 'Credit Knife' Bearers of the Southeast...** the 'Incense-Topped God-Summoners' of Lingnan...*** the 'Community Fire Spirit-Descenders' of the Central Region...**** the Paths of a Hundred Schools...\n\nLü Ting could understand the strength of these genius investigators, but Lu Ding's strength, he couldn't quite grasp. If he couldn't understand it, then the other geniuses training in various districts probably wouldn't figure it out either. When the geniuses and the 'monster' meet, these 'little geniuses' will probably want to understand...\n\n“This year should be the most 'a hundred flowers blooming' training session in a century...” Lü Ting cleared his throat: “Ahem, since you've all made your choices, and tickets are being booked, then that's it for today. I'll be waiting for you at the training ground!”\n\nHe had originally thought he could take a few back, but who knew, he didn't manage to take anyone back. They all went for the training reward.\n\n“Thank you, leader.”\n\nLu Ding was the first to stand up and express his thanks, walking out of the room. Bai Hemian followed, and the others passed by one after another, the words 'Thank you, leader' constantly ringing in his ears.\n\nOutside the door. Yan Feifan had been waiting for a long time. Seeing Lu Ding and Bai Hemian come out, he came up and asked, “Brother Lu, Brother Bai, how was it? Did you choose the training reward?”\n\n“Of course, we chose it, and it's Mount Hei.”\n\nHearing Lu Ding's words, a mischievous smile appeared on Yan Feifan's face: “Doesn't that mean the hidden danger can be completely resolved? Are there any restrictions?”\n\n“Restrictions certainly exist, but they'll be gone soon.”\n\nIt was mentioned before that there were still ordinary people up there. When Lu Ding killed Ye Feng, in a few days it would be the Ghost Festival. If the Qi Refiners from up there wanted to come down for revenge, that would inevitably put the ordinary people of Mount Hei in danger, and it would be impossible for them to relocate all the ordinary people themselves. That's why the Qi Refiners from up there didn't come down. Now this problem has shifted to Lu Ding. If he goes up Mount Hei, he can't possibly kill all the ordinary and innocent people along with them, can he? But compared to the Qi Refiners on Mount Hei, who had no choice, Lu Ding has a lot more room to maneuver.\n\n“Brother Lu, how do you plan to do it?”\n\nListening to Bai Hemian's question, Lu Ding took out the envelope. Apart from the information Lü Ting had mentioned, the rest, broadly speaking, comprised four big characters: 'Act as appropriate'.\n\nThese four characters carried a significant amount of information. What Lü Ting initially said was 'In view of'. This indicated that the higher-ups knew Lu Ding and Mount Hei had a conflict, and under such circumstances, Lu Ding was going. Once both sides met, they were destined to fight to the death. The people above wouldn't be thoughtless; they wouldn't fail to consider his personality. Therefore, 'act as appropriate' meant that Mount Hei had been up to something behind the scenes. Now that you're going, how many to kill, how many to spare, whether you can kill them, whether you have the ability—you decide for yourself. But there was one point: ordinary people must not be touched.\n\nThinking carefully, it seemed to make sense. If you weren't up to anything, what's with sending people down one after another?! It's clear they can't stay on the mountain; they're becoming restless. Before, when told to come down, you wouldn't. Now you want to come down on your own, and you're still causing trouble?\n\n“Feifan, after killing Ye Feng last time, what did the higher-ups say when the report was submitted?” Lu Ding asked.\n\nYan Feifan answered truthfully: “They didn't give a substantive reply, but I've somewhat grasped the general meaning—they probably want to postpone handling it, to settle accounts in autumn.”*****\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding reconfirmed the conjecture in his mind. Seeing his expression, Yan Feifan's eyes lit up: “Brother Lu, is this the rhythm of 'autumn execution'?”\n\nLu Ding shook the envelope in his hand: “What 'autumn execution'? This is the Mount Hei Rural Revitalization Relocation Plan! Draft documents, delineate resettlement zones, transfer household registrations to Kaoshan City at the foot of Mount Hei, and move Black Mountain Village!!”\n\n“Yes! Brother Lu, I'll do it right away!!”\n\nAs Yan Feifan sent up the documents, it was almost green lights all the way. Soon, the report from the higher-ups came out. It wouldn't even take an hour in total, even after deducting the time spent drafting the documents. Clearly, this had been prepared long ago, with many contingencies. No matter what level Lu Ding thought of, the higher-ups would immediately provide an answer.\n\n---\n*   This is a play on Chinese characters. The character for \"handle/do\" (辦) can be visually broken down into two dots (亠) and the radical for \"force\" (力). The character for \"do/work\" (干) consists of two horizontal strokes and one vertical stroke. It emphasizes immediate action and execution.\n**   In Chinese folk culture, 'Credit Knife' Bearers (賒刀人) were often itinerant fortune tellers who would sell knives on credit, promising the buyer would pay when a specific, often unusual, prediction came true, thus demonstrating their prophetic ability.\n*** 'Incense-Topped God-Summoners' (頂香請神) refers to a folk ritual, particularly in Lingnan, where practitioners would place burning incense on top of their heads or on a tall object as part of a ritual to invite or commune with deities.\n**** 'Community Fire Spirit-Descenders' (社火降神) refers to practitioners who perform rituals, often involving fire and traditional folk performances (社火), to invite or manifest spirits/deities, particularly common in the Central Plains.\n***** 'Settle accounts in autumn' (秋後算賬) is an idiom meaning to postpone dealing with something unpleasant or to settle scores later, often when the opportunity is ripe or when one has the upper hand.",

    "content": ".....\n\nThe report went down, straight to Backer City, below Mount Black.\n\nIt included detailed regional divisions, housing arrangements, subsidies, and other items.\n\nAnd it had to be implemented immediately.\n\nThe reason for the village relocation, stated in the final column, was that three months ago, a volcanic eruption in Hetu Nation caused crustal movement. After on-site inspection by experts, the area around Black Mountain Village, Mount Black, might have earthquake risks, necessitating immediate village relocation.\n\nThe above was an external notification.\n\nThe next was a notification received by the 749 Branch Office stationed in Backer City.\n\nCloud Sea 749 Special Commissioner will arrive in Backer City tonight to execute the Mount Black Bandit Suppression Plan. All investigators from the 749 Branch Office stationed in Backer City are responsible for cooperation.\n\nIt detailed:\n\nBlack Mountain Village Chief, Ye Laoliu, real name Ye Chengfeng, violated old contracts, repeatedly and intentionally letting dispatched Qi Refiners from Black Mountain Village leave the mountain, a dozen or so people in total. Most of these Mount Black Qi Refiners committed crimes in various places. Including, but not limited to, using Qi Refiner methods for robbery and fraud. Maliciously killing ordinary people under the identity of a Qi Refiner. Obstructing 749 investigators from handling cases, deliberately retaliating against 749 investigators. Ye Chengfeng himself, and his subordinate Black Mountain Village Qi Refiners, had close ties with overseas Qi Refiner forces, having harbored overseas Qi Refiner criminals and helped overseas Qi Refiners escape.....\n\nDown the page, many pieces of intelligence that Mount Black thought the outside world didn't know surfaced. It wasn't that Great Han 749 didn't know; it was that these things wouldn't be deeply investigated for now. If a Qi Refiner came down from your Mount Black and committed a crime, we'd catch them where they were, and that would be the end of it; we wouldn't subject you to collective punishment. Although the contract signed at the time stipulated that if you didn't come down and wanted to be free up there, if you reneged and caused trouble, I could apply collective punishment. But considering you've been law-abiding all these years, I'd just catch the main culprit and turn a blind eye. But now you've gone too far. Outbursts are often not caused by a single incident but by accumulation, by constant dripping wearing away a stone, by repeated provocations. Black Mountain Village had finally breached 749's red line. Their relationship with Four Seas Group, their relationship with Cao Family Alley, that old man from Four Seas Group who came down from Mount Black. Everything could prove it. You, the old bandits of Black Mountain Village, after signing the no-descent-from-the-mountain contract, deliberately influenced everything down the mountain, just so you could have a place outside when you came down! Trying to exploit loopholes through long-term planning? Sorry, Bureau 749, which supervises Great Han's Qi Refiners, isn't stupid, nor is it blind. We're all Qi Refiners, who are you trying to outlast? Are you implying you ate well as a bandit, so you can live longer?\n\nShi Lei, the director of the 749 Branch Office stationed in Backer City, took a deep breath after reading these documents.\n\n“Notify everyone, gather and prepare for battle! I'm going to the airport to pick up the Special Commissioner!!!” After speaking, he thought of something else: “Zhou Yun should avoid suspicion, so he doesn't need to come. Keep your mouths shut tightly, don't reveal any information to him!”\n\nThe order went down. Soon, all investigators of Backer City's 749 Branch Office sprung into action. It was already late at night. Many had already gone to bed and now had to get up, so it was inevitable they'd have complaints in their hearts. Although there hadn't been a Hundred Ghosts Night Parade in Backer City recently, there had still been demons and monsters causing trouble. They had just finished fighting and hadn't even rested for a few days before another emergency mission arrived.\n\nA certain residential complex in Backer City.\n\nQiu Wangshui, the Deputy Director of Backer 749 Branch Office, looked at the intelligence sent by the Director. Her gaze fell upon the teenager watching TV on the sofa. She silently sighed.\n\n“Zhou Yun, I have something to do at the bureau. You go to bed early at home. You don't need to report to the bureau tomorrow, there's nothing going on anyway. You can go out and play or rest for a few days.”\n\nThe handsome young man turned his head.\n\nHoliday? Then can't I go up the mountain to find my grandpa and uncles to learn skills? Coming back to his senses, Zhou Yun asked, puzzled:\n\n“Huh? Aunt Qiu, you're still going to the bureau this late?”\n\n“Yes, some documents from above need to be signed.”\n\nQiu Wangshui quickly dressed. Before leaving, she looked at Zhou Yun, \"Only Mount Black could make you avoid suspicion.\" If it weren't for Mount Black, your future would surely be bright.\n\nMidnight.\n\nLu Ding successfully landed in Backer City. Exiting the airport, he saw Shi Lei, the director of Backer City 749 Branch Office, who had contacted him during the plane's taxiing. He got into his car. And headed straight to Backer City 749.\n\nOn the way, Shi Lei looked at Lu Ding through the rearview mirror. His heart was filled with awe at Lu Ding's exploits and talent. They were all from the same sub-bureau, so of course, he knew this information. Especially major events like Lu Ding's special admission and his assistance in killing Shi Gandang. Not to mention him, even the investigators of Backer City 749 probably all knew him and could recount his exploits inside and out. It wasn't that their memory was good; it was that the time between each event was too short, the buzz too great, and the impact too strong. Like a fake, too profound, making it hard not to remember after seeing it.\n\nLu Ding, sitting in the passenger seat, was reading documents about Black Mountain Village and personnel files of Backer City's 749 Branch Office. To suppress the bandits of Mount Black, he couldn't handle everything alone. He had to deal with that formidable old man. Lu Ding had even thought of a tactic: immediately casting the Way of the Jin Cart upon leaving, and launching a zero-frame opening directly upon arrival, no matter what. First, severely injure him, then rely on Living Metamorphosis to exchange injuries and wear the old man down. I can't kill you instantly, but I can slowly wear you down to death, right? And during this process, the other Qi Refiners of Black Mountain Village would be left to Backer City 749 Branch Office to handle.\n\nHmm! That's the plan.\n\nJust as his thoughts reached this point, Lu Ding's finger, scrolling on his phone screen, suddenly stopped. A red-backed standard photo, with information below: Zhou Yun, formerly named Zhao Yun, male, twenty years old, intern investigator at Backer City 749 Branch Office, Seventh Tier Radiant Sphere Realm. Of course, this was just basic information. The key was his background section, which stated: Mother, Zhou Fang, Black Mountain Village resident. Twenty-five years ago, eloped down the mountain with Zhou Yun's father, later married and had a child, divorced eighteen years ago, and died of illness fifteen years ago......\n\nZhao Yun, why aren't you called Zhao Zilong? Lu Ding thought subconsciously, then opened his mouth to ask Shi Lei, who was driving: “Director Shi, what's with this Zhou Yun? Given his Mount Black background, his status as an intern investigator probably isn't right, is it?”\n\nBackground check! The most crucial thing for joining Bureau 749 is the background check. If you don't pass it, no matter how high your talent, you won't be allowed to join. As for why? To use a classic example. In *The Legend of the New White Snake*, Bai Suzhen and Fahai fought, Bai Suzhen lost, and was later suppressed beneath Leifeng Pagoda, atoning and accepting punishment for the common people she indirectly caused to die. The battle was earth-shattering. Xu Xian and Xiao Qing outside tried every conceivable method, but couldn't rescue her, absolutely couldn't rescue her. The great monk Fahai, holding an alms bowl like a rice pot, planted it there, 'Come, try to kill me. If you can't kill me, don't even think about saving her.'",

    "content": "One was a monk with profound cultivation, whose kasaya could block floods.\n\nOne was a thousand-year-old snake demon, who would flood a whole city if displeased.\n\nThen.\n\nEighteen years passed.\n\nBai Suzhen's son, Xu Shilin, grew up and said, \"Fahai, I want you to personally open the pagoda door and release my mother.\"\n\nFahai looked at him: \"How many dishes did you eat today, acting so arrogant.\"\n\n\"Don't just say you're a teenager; even if you were over a hundred years old, you still couldn't defeat me.\"\n\nThen.....\n\nFahai was dumbfounded.\n\nXu Shilin became the top scholar, and Leifeng Pagoda became an old and dangerous structure.\n\nFahai became a staff member of the scenic area who had committed an offense and was dismissed, simply referred to as Fa So-and-so.\n\nFor the snake demon who had cultivated for over a thousand years, eighteen years was just the time it took to nap, take a siesta; her son grew up and came to invite her out for afternoon tea.\n\nSee, those who fail background checks shouldn't take the civil service exam, otherwise, no one knows if they'll pull strings for people once they get the job.*\n\nOnce they start pulling strings, it's truly unfair to those who died.\n\nAnd to those who were harmed: houses they worked their whole lives to buy were swept away just like that; whole families, old and young, who couldn't escape, were gone just like that.\n\nSeeing the main culprit imprisoned, there was finally some comfort in their hearts.\n\nBut before you even die, they're out, and you're old while she hasn't aged.\n\nHer son is the top scholar and has married, she has a husband who deeply loves her, and a sister who cares for her; simply a perfect family.\n\nWhat about you?\n\nJust thinking about it almost causes a brain hemorrhage.\n\nListening to Lu Ding ask about Zhou Yun.\n\nShi Lei was silent for a moment, then said, \"His situation is quite special, so.......\"\n\n\"Special? How special?\"\n\n\"I'm here today. If he recognizes me and turns around to tell the bandits on Black Mountain.\"\n\n\"Allowing those up there to be prepared.\"\n\n\"The moment I go up, I'll have to face a ready-and-waiting Destiny Control Realm cultivator, who'll strike me head-on?\"\n\nA prepared Destiny Control Realm cultivator and an unprepared Destiny Control Realm cultivator are two different concepts.\n\nA starved camel is still bigger than a horse.** If Lu Ding's charged sneak attack fails, and he has to fight wound for wound, grinding down the old man, it's not certain who would go first.\n\nShi Lei also knew the possibility of this problem.\n\nOnce it happens, it will lead to an uncontrollable situation and casualties, and it's completely avoidable.\n\nListening to Lu Ding's words, he felt an inexplicable sense of pressure.\n\nBut he didn't evade it.\n\n\"It's my fault for not doing my job well, but I've already notified everyone not to tell him, to let him avoid suspicion.\"\n\n\"Previously, his mother was good friends with Deputy Director Qiu Wangshui of our institute. After his mother died, he stayed at Deputy Director Qiu's home.\"\n\n\"Later, he unexpectedly awakened and became a Qi Refiner. After a considerable period of observation, and with a recommendation from Deputy Director Qiu Wangshui, he ultimately became a contractual member of 749.\"\n\n\"Later, official investigator Cao Zi'ang came to Kaoshan City for a mission, and Zhou Yun helped quite a bit. Then, with a joint recommendation from Investigator Cao Zi'ang and Deputy Director Qiu Wangshui, he was transferred to become an intern investigator.\"\n\nCao Zi'ang, well, that explains it. That guy has a screw loose, he would indeed do something like this.\n\nHe still causes trouble even after dying; he's already decomposed, yet he leaves problems for him.\n\nHowever, Lu Ding also understood.\n\nIn this situation, Director Shi really seemed unable to refuse. First, it was a recommendation from a deputy director, a colleague of many years; sometimes, giving a little favor isn't a problem.\n\nSo Lu Ding could understand this contractual identity.\n\nAfter all, even the Five Viscera Birth Society can become contractual members. If you have contributions, someone appreciates you, and you're not a great villain, why can't you become a contractual member?\n\nBut, intern status, that's a bit much.\n\nContractual members can access certain resource benefits, but interns can see many things related to 749, and also have certain rights.\n\nFurthermore, Cao Zi'ang came from Yunhai Bureau 749. Recommending this Zhou Yun through Shi Lei's side was merely a notification to him.\n\nAfter all, Zhou Yun had the identity of a contractual member, his age was suitable, and this place was remote. Cao Zi'ang, an official investigator, and Qiu Wangshui, a deputy director, both vouched for him.\n\nThat the intern status could be approved, Lu Ding could understand Shi Lei's dilemma, but while Lu Ding could understand, he could not accept it.\n\nThis is an invisible bomb, and it might even blow him up. If this trip to Black Mountain Village goes wrong because of this person.....\n\nLu Ding was silent.\n\nThe atmosphere in the car was a bit heavy.\n\nSoon.\n\nDirector Shi's car arrived at the location.\n\nIn the assembly square, investigators stood tall and straight, waiting for the arrival of the special envoy.\n\nAnd not far from the team.\n\nA heroic and spirited woman, with her hair tied up, was pushing a young man outwards.\n\nLu Ding took one look and matched the young man's appearance with the photo in Zhou Yun's information file, a perfect hundred percent match.\n\n\"Aunt Qiu, I'm an investigator too. You all joined the mission, but you won't let me join. Why not?\"\n\n\"Brother Hai, Sister Xu, Brother Gou, please help me persuade Aunt Qiu.\"\n\nZhou Yun wasn't a fool. It was past midnight on Ghost Festival and they were still going out saying there was something. He took out his phone to ask the other investigators on duty.\n\nWhen others didn't reply to his messages one by one, or were vague, he could probably guess there might be a mission tonight.\n\nThen he quietly followed, and happened to run into the assembly.\n\nQiu Wangshui was originally gently persuading Zhou Yun to go back, until she saw Shi Lei's car slowly approaching.\n\nA pair of eyes in the car met hers from a distance.\n\nIt made her heart skip a beat.\n\nLooking again at the appearance of the person in the car, Qiu Wangshui's face immediately changed.\n\nHow could the special envoy who arrived be *him*!!?\n\nDidn't he go for advanced studies!!?\n\nIf he were to know the relationship between Zhou Yun and Black Mountain, judging by his way of doing things and past deeds.\n\nZhou Yun would probably......\n\nThinking of this, Qiu Wangshui loudly reprimanded: \"Zhou Yun! Obey orders! Get out of here right now!!!\"\n\nBefore the vehicle had even stopped steadily, the car door opened, and a figure flashed out.\n\nIt came directly in front of the two, hovering an inch above the ground, blocking their path.\n\n\"Go? Go where?\"\n\nTo this suddenly appearing stranger, Zhou Yun only felt that the moment he pressed closer, the surrounding light seemed to be swallowed by darkness.\n\nThe heavy sense of oppression made him feel a bit breathless.\n\nBut Lu Ding's epaulets told him that this was a 749 investigator, and since he himself was a 749 intern investigator, others shouldn't make things difficult for him.\n\nBut the next second, what Lu Ding said shattered all his conjectures.\n\n\"Zhou Yun, right? I'm Lu Ding, the special envoy from Yunhai 749. I've been ordered to annihilate the Qi Refiners of Black Mountain. What are your thoughts on this?\"\n\nThe amount of information was too immense. Everyone present was almost instantly stunned.\n\nSpecial Envoy Lu Ding?\n\nThe Corpse-disassembling Tai Sui of Baofan District?\n\nDidn't he get a guaranteed placement?\n\nAnnihilate Black Mountain? Why suddenly annihilate Black Mountain?\n\nThese were the things others heard and were shocked by.\n\nBut the key point Zhou Yun heard was: annihilate the Qi Refiners of Black Mountain?\n\nAren't his maternal grandfather and maternal uncles among them too?\n\nA flicker of panic and worry flashed in Zhou Yun's eyes.\n\nCoincidentally, this flicker of panic and worry was precisely captured by Lu Ding, who had been looking down at him, confirming it with his gaze.\n\nBang!!!\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Yun himself was sent flying directly, collapsing unconscious to the ground.\n\nThis was something no one had reacted to. How did Lu Ding suddenly make a move?\n\n\"Special Envoy Lu!!\"\n___\n* \"get the job\" - Literally \"reach the shore\" (上岸), an idiom used to describe successfully obtaining a civil service job. \"Pull strings for people\" (撈人) literally means \"to fish people out,\" an idiom often implying using connections or illegal means to help someone avoid consequences.\n** \"A starved camel is still bigger than a horse\" (瘦死的駱駝比馬大) - A common Chinese idiom meaning that even a greatly weakened powerful person or thing is still superior to a weaker one.",

    "content": "Fury erupted in Qiu Wangshui’s heart. Although Zhou Yun was not her son, she had watched him grow up and raised him; in terms of a mother-son relationship, she was practically his birth mother. Now that Zhou Yun had been beaten, how could she possibly tolerate it?\n\nLu Ding turned his head to look at her.\n\n“Don’t shout. Now it’s your turn. Irregular operations, abuse of power. Director Shi already said not to call him. I don’t know if he came secretly on his own, or what. But it was clearly stated not to call him. When he came, you didn’t drive him away. You gently pushed him around here, and only shouted loudly when I arrived. Were you afraid I’d discover him? Emergency missions and confidentiality clauses, do I need to teach them to you one by one?”\n\nLu Ding’s words silenced everyone present and suppressed Qiu Wangshui’s rage. Combining what Lu Ding said before, and Zhou Yun’s relationship with Black Mountain, how could she not know that if Zhou Yun’s thoughts were to deviate in any way, the Qi Refiners of Black Mountain would be on guard, the mission would fail, colleagues would die in the line of duty? These things, one by one, scene by scene, would unfold before her eyes.\n\n“Little Yun he…”\n\nAs she tried to say more for Zhou Yun, Lu Ding directly interrupted her.\n\n“Shut up. I don’t want to hear any excuses for him, nor do I want to take risks or pay the price for your conjectures. You also don’t deserve to gamble with my life and the lives of so many others by going to Black Mountain, betting on whether he’ll leak information.”\n\nAs he spoke, Lu Ding’s phone rang. Just now, on the way here, after he learned about this person and finished talking with Shi Lei, he sent Zhou Yun’s personal information to the bureau for detailed comparison. Now the details were coming in.\n\nLu Ding held up his phone.\n\n“See that? His maternal grandfather and maternal uncle are on Black Mountain, and they’re both Qi Refiners. When your resolve wavers, the answer is often self-evident! Now. Investigator Qiu Wangshui, remove your insignia!!”\n\nZhou Yun being a provisional investigator was a recognition of his talent. That’s understandable. But Zhou Yun becoming an intern investigator, that was a small indulgence of power. Since you could make the move to promote him, then Lu Ding, now a Special Envoy Investigator, can also decide to demote both of you to the very bottom and detain you for investigation! As for the final outcome, it’s up to the higher-ups to decide. Anyway, this mission cannot have any mishaps. Black Mountain must be eradicated. These investigators responsible for assisting his work should also not be at any risk.\n\nQiu Wangshui lowered her brows, concealing the bleakness in her eyes. She knew that what she did didn’t comply with regulations, and today’s events were even more non-compliant... Seeing her slow movements, Lu Ding directly reached out, tore off the insignia from her shoulder, and threw it to Shi Lei.\n\n“Dawdling, who are those crocodile tears for? If you truly valued this, you shouldn’t have ended up like this today. Director Shi, shackle her, detain her. After the Black Mountain incident is over, send her to the 749 Investigation Tribunal together!”\n\nShi Lei and several 749 Investigators from Kaoshan City came forward and apprehended Qiu Wangshui. She looked sideways: “Special Envoy Lu, won’t you give me any dignity?”\n\nThe moment she spoke those words, Lu Ding raised his hand and struck her shoulder with a palm. Spiritual Qi flowed in, and Qiu Wangshui immediately fainted. The moment she said that, it was destined she wouldn’t get any dignity. Lu Ding gave her dignity by letting her remove her insignia. Dawdling, trying to manipulate emotions, who was that for? For Lu Ding? Or for the other investigators? To put it bluntly, this was shaking morale. These investigators present had worked with her for many years. Seeing her encounter this today, if she were to further manipulate their emotions, it might affect mission efficiency. Lu Ding took her insignia; she still wanted dignity? The moment she said that, it meant she harbored dissatisfaction and resentment. To prevent this person from escaping when he went up Black Mountain, or if other circumstances arose leading to her escape and affecting the mission, Lu Ding chose to directly knock her out, infuse Spiritual Qi to restrict her consciousness. If anyone dared to forcefully help her undo it, unless they were significantly stronger than Lu Ding, their brains would be scrambled. If such a person appeared in this place, then there would be no need for the mission. Lu Ding would directly fly away, return, and bring a group of true powerhouses for a tactical clean-up.\n\nThe minor interlude was handled. Next was the matter of Black Mountain.\n\nInside the conference room, the full view of Black Mountain emerged on the 3D virtual combat sandbox. Lu Ding reached out to zoom in, combining it with the urgent study he did on the way here regarding Black Mountain’s full layout and its personnel information. He planted four flags around Black Mountain: front, back, left, and right. Pointing at the foremost flag, he said, “Director Shi and I will openly enter the village from here. The rest of you will ascend the mountain from the left and right directions. As for the cliff on the back mountain, find a few people with good movement techniques, bring all sorts of bombs, booby traps, and trap formations from our bureau. Activate them and throw them down, then also place them all over the cliff face for me. Don’t consider the cost.”\n\nLu Ding’s words gradually raised doubts among many. Someone asked, puzzled, “Special Envoy Lu, won’t it be too dangerous for you to enter the village from the front?”\n\n“If Director Shi and I don’t go from the front, then it would be you going. Once you make a move, facing a Fate Weaver means instant kill. At that time, the compensation funds would have to be deducted from my mission budget, and there’s not much in total. We can’t afford to have you die.”\n\nCasualties can be avoided, so why insist on sacrificing others’ lives to fill the gap? Moreover, Lu Ding unleashes a powerful move upon meeting. Its power is immense; others following would only get in the way. Although the words weren’t pleasant, these investigators were all laughing as they listened.\n\nSomeone else asked.\n\n“Special Envoy Lu, that cliff bottom is a desperate place, a place of death, Black Mountain’s burial ground. Once you go in, you can’t get out. No one could possibly go down there. Wouldn’t using formations, bombs, booby traps, and such be a bit of a waste?”\n\n“There’s no water below, you wouldn’t even hear a splash if you threw something down, and you couldn’t recover it either.”\n\nLu Ding looked at the person who asked: “So you’ve fallen into a thinking fallacy. Haven’t you watched TV all these years? How many people have fallen off cliffs and stumbled upon fortuitous encounters? As for what you call a place of death or a dead end, that’s just your thinking being limited. I have a friend you’ve probably all heard of. His name is Bai Hemian, and he’s also a 749 Investigator. For him, going in and out of such places is as familiar as coming home. With the first person like that, there will be a second. No one can guarantee if a second one will appear on Black Mountain. There’s no need to gamble. Anyway, these things are meant to be used. If there’s no such person, and the items are used, I’ll go back and write a note for you to get replacements. If there is such a person, even if he doesn’t die, falling down will turn him into fodder for the formations and booby traps, safe and secure.”\n\nEveryone finally understood. This Special Envoy Lu really was… arrogant, wild, yet cautious, and had a peculiar way of thinking. Leaders generally fall into three categories. What they feared most was someone who didn’t understand but gave blind commands, and wouldn’t participate themselves. They were wary of those who charged forward thoughtlessly but had no real ability themselves. They most liked those who were capable enough to lead the charge, had the brains to command battles, and spoke powerfully. Lu Ding was the last type.",

    "content": "...\n\nAs the saying goes, speed is paramount in war. With the key points covered and precautions implemented, it was time to get straight to it.\n\nCombat supplies for Qi Refiners were carried out box by box from Kaoshan City's 749 Bureau armory.\n\nVarious talismans, single-use consumables, healing medicines, and so on, armed every 749 investigator from Kaoshan City to the teeth.\n\nAs for whether it would be wasteful?\n\nDoesn't matter.\n\nThe higher-ups would cover the cost.\n\nSuch trivial things—as long as Heishan Village, which was like a ticking time bomb on Mount Dahei, was dealt with—it would be entirely worth it.\n\nSoon, everyone had assembled.\n\nThen, at Lu Ding's command:\n\n\"Depart!!!\"\n\nShi Lei reached into a small pouch at his waist, pulled out several paper birds, threw them out, and cast a spell by forming hand seals. The paper birds grew larger in the wind, transforming into giant birds with wingspans of over ten meters.\n\nAs the director of a local branch, with so many investigators, what made him capable of the job?\n\nHe naturally had to possess some special talent.\n\nEveryone mounted the birds.\n\nLu Ding followed, leaping into the air, flipping his body in mid-air. Pieces of dark, gleaming scales surged into existence, adhering to his body. Black mist swirled, from which fierce beasts charged out, biting onto the armor with open mouths, solidifying into monstrous faces.\n\nAs Lu Ding landed on the bird's back, his Four Beasts Vying for Ferocity Armor exuded a menacing aura, its fierce might self-evident.\n\nEveryone looked over, thinking, \"It's starting, he's charging up. This is the first stage, the General's Armor.\"\n\nThen, as spiritual energy surged in Lu Ding's hand, those around him felt a stinging sensation on their skin, and a thought arose in their minds again.\n\n\"Second stage, compressing and charging that strange slash.\"\n\nThe paper birds soared, piercing through clouds and mist.\n\nOn Mount Dahei.\n\nNo insects chirped, no birds sang, all was silent.\n\nOutside Heishan Village.\n\nTrees beckoned, grass turned back, ghosts were everywhere.\n\nThis was Mount Dahei; after nightfall, it was a forbidden zone for the living, a place where no one alive should enter. Lu Ding observed closely from the bird's back.\n\nRumors about Mount Dahei flashed through his mind. He had thought it would be incredibly formidable, but upon arriving and seeing it, it was just full of minor ghosts and spirits; he found it too much effort even to kill them.\n\nAt most, they'd drop a few colorless small crystal blocks.\n\nThis also indirectly explained why Mount Dahei only became ferocious after nightfall: because these entities had insufficient cultivation and shallow foundations, they dared not show their faces during the day.\n\nAfter nightfall, with the weakening of Yang energy, if a living person entered, like ants gnawing an elephant to death, they'd take a bite here, a bite there, sucking dry your Yang energy, and then everyone would be good friends.\n\nWalking and walking, people would turn into ghosts.\n\nOne after another, they went in and couldn't come out. Mount Dahei's fearsome reputation naturally spread.\n\nAnd among the small fish, there were also big fish; who knows, if you were unlucky, you might run into one.\n\nBut at least Lu Ding didn't encounter any.\n\nThe 749 Bureau feared nothing. Many years ago, when bandits were suppressed on Mount Dahei, the pioneers wearing epaulets fought from the foot of the mountain to the top. Wherever they went, no matter what had gained sentience, even a wild dog would get a slap and be pulled over for inspection to see if it had gained sentience.\n\nTherefore, the epaulets they wore were the best pass: the small ones dared not provoke them, and the big ones dared not offend them.\n\nThe journey had been peaceful and uneventful, until a towering poplar tree blocked their path.\n\nThe leaves rustled without wind, making a pat-pat-pat-pat sound. Looking closely, they saw that each leaf had transformed into a human hand, constantly shaking and colliding to produce a clapping sound.\n\nA poplar tree.\n\nFolk records also called it the 'Ghost Beckoner'; as for why, one would understand upon hearing its leaves clapping.\n\nA poplar tree over a hundred years old might be called 'Grandma Yang,' 'Mother Yang,' in some places...\n\nLegend has it that if a child died young and vaguely became a ghost, their curious and playful nature would be attracted by the sound of the poplar tree's leaves colliding.\n\nOver time, more and more small ghosts gathered there, and the name 'Grandma Yang' came into being.\n\nThe towering poplar tree planted just outside Heishan Village was the legendary Grandma Yang.\n\nAccording to the 749 Bureau's investigative records, this \"Grandma Yang\" was Heishan Village's guardian spirit, from the same den as the village.\n\n\"Good evening, 749 investigators. It's late, and you're still on duty. What brings you to Heishan Village?\"\n\nDirector Shi, with a solemn expression, opened his mouth: \"You're not worthy...\"\n\nBefore he could finish, only three words had come out.\n\nA voice and a slash erupted simultaneously from beside him.\n\n\"To send you to the afterlife!\"\n\nWhile stabilizing the charged slash in his hand, Lu Ding simultaneously diverted his spiritual energy to multitask. He cast his gaze, and spiritual energy flowed from within him to gather in his eyes, transparent curves spreading across them.\n\nWhere the eye went, the art followed.\n\nThe slash cut down, catching the poplar tree spirit off guard. A spirit with deep spiritual cultivation was instantly cut in half.\n\nInstantly, Yin energy surged, and black mist ran rampant.\n\n[Monster Contained: Hundred-Year Poplar Tree Spirit]\n[Containment Reward: Poplar Blossom Tree Burial]\n[Poplar Blossom Tree Burial: The target's body transforms into a tree]\n\nAlthough this art itself wasn't particularly powerful, it could complement the Dark Death Black Coffin Art.\n\n[Poplar Blossom Tree Burial, ready; Dark Death Black Coffin Art, ready]\n\nThe words of the two arts began to dissipate, merging, and a new two-in-one art made its debut.\n\n[Art: Flower Coffin Death Burial]\n[Using the enemy as a seed, the art as a guide; flowers bloom and fall, people die and souls perish.]\n\nThe gain from the Flower Coffin Death Burial art was, surprisingly, beyond Lu Ding's expectations.\n\nSo this was the complementarity between heaven and earth?\n\nThe Dark Death Black Coffin Art obtained from the Poplar Blossom Ghost Corpse Spirit could actually complement the Poplar Blossom Tree Burial provided by this poplar tree spirit, becoming the Flower Coffin Death Burial.\n\nCompared to the individual power of the former two, the Flower Coffin Death Burial was at least several times more powerful.\n\nThe last time it was the Wind-Calming Art and the Blood Rain Art.\n\nThe Bloody Gale and Rain was so exaggerated in power that Lu Ding could barely wield it.\n\nNow there was another art, but this one had fewer limitations than the Bloody Gale and Rain; it could be used freely.\n\nIf the Bloody Gale and Rain was AOE, then this Flower Coffin Death Burial was a point-kill.\n\nAnd...\n\nThis thing was flashy and cool; killing by making flowers bloom, with petals scattering everywhere, and a lone figure standing amidst them.\n\n\"Flowers bloom and fall, people die and souls perish.\" Lu Ding couldn't imagine how showy this would be.\n\nShi Lei, standing nearby, felt the life-and-death battle begin and end in a flash.\n\nA strange feeling couldn't help but rise in his heart.\n\nHe had originally intended to say, \"You're not worthy of asking about our official business?\" and then make his move.\n\nNormally, his personality wasn't like this, but he thought of making things simpler to cooperate with Lu Ding's work, as it was said this special envoy liked to omit many unnecessary things.\n\nYet Shi Lei hadn't expected it.\n\nIt would be *this* abbreviated...\n\nUltimately, his thinking couldn't keep up.\n\nAs the poplar tree spirit died at the village entrance, the towering tree snapped in half at the trunk, and its collapse instantly attracted the attention of the Qi Refiners in the village.\n\nThis also aligned with what Lu Ding had said before the operation: their frontal assault was one, and attracting attention was two.\n\nTaking this opportunity, other investigators moved in from the other two directions, some setting traps, others rushing in to kill.\n\nSeveral figures maneuvered through the village and approached.\n\nLu Ding looked at their faces, comparing them to Ye Chengfeng's appearance in the data. After realizing the person wasn't among them, Lu Ding took a step back and floated in the air.\n\n\"Director Shi, go ahead.\"",

    "content": "This was Shi Lei's role: to deal with Great Black Mountain's other high-end combatants, excluding Ye Chengfeng.\n\nAs for Lu Ding.\n\nHe had been charging up big skills all the way, so of course he was going for the most powerful one.\n\nClear division of labor, efficient work.\n\nShi Lei knew it was time for him to redeem himself through meritorious service. Otherwise, once Qiu Wangshui and Zhou Yun's matter was written up in a report and sent upwards...\n\n...his time as Director would be over.\n\nAlthough he couldn't stop this from happening—because personal connections were hard to explain, and he had indeed approved the 'unofficial' status—it wasn't really a major mistake.\n\nBut!\n\nHe was the Director, and Zhou Yun had a Great Black Mountain background and had even become an intern investigator—he couldn't escape responsibility for that.\n\nPiloting the Flying Bird, he plunged down to kill.\n\nWith a raised hand, he unleashed his strongest offensive technique.\n\nThe power he unleashed instantly startled the Qi Refiners of Black Mountain Village who were rushing over from below.\n\n\"Shi, are you crazy? You come out with your famous unique skill, flattening people into paper, seizing souls with paper figures, right off the bat! Even if we had a grudge to wipe out your entire clan, you wouldn't need to be so ruthless from the start!!\"\n\nThe few of them teamed up to resist, but were almost instantly dazed.\n\nOne of them was hit on the spot, his flesh and blood turning into white paper, his bones into bamboo strips, instantly reducing their numbers by half a person.\n\nShi Lei's face darkened: \"Cut the damn crap.\"\n\nRight away with a killing move?\n\nThis isn't normal. After all, Lu Ding set a precedent; there are even bigger killing moves waiting. What is this?\n\n\"Third Brother, this Shi guy has gone mad! All his moves are brutal, vicious, and lethal.\"\n\n\"He must be crazy, it's inexplicable.\"\n\nThe two of them exchanged words, saying nothing more, before the one who got hit could speak.\n\nThen battle sounds erupted from other locations.\n\nOnly at this moment did they realize this was an attack on Black Mountain Village, not just targeting an individual.\n\nIn the village.\n\nAn old man quickly grabbed various books and magical artifacts, stuffing them into a box and handing it to a boy of eighteen or nineteen.\n\n\"Go! Go quickly! The farther the better! Don't come back to Black Mountain Village, and don't think about revenge ever again!!!\"\n\nTears welled in the boy's eyes.\n\n\"Grandpa, I won't go! I'm a member of Black Mountain Village! I want to live and die with Black Mountain Village! No matter what happens, this is my home, and I don't want to leave!!\"\n\nYe Chengfeng sighed and stroked the boy's head.\n\n\"Grandpa made mistakes, and now I must bear the consequences. Remember Grandpa's words: a person must be pragmatic. Remember, when doing anything, never be greedy; you cannot want both this and that.<sup>[1]</sup>\"\n\nHe himself wanted both the unrestrained freedom of the old days and the current freedom, which was why today's situation had come to be.\n\nThe old man turned, opened the door, and looked back: \"Your brother Ye Xuan is dead. The hope of Black Mountain Village rests on you. If you don't want me to die in vain, then go quickly!\"\n\n\"Remember the fortune Blind Granny told you: a new lease on life from a dead end!!<sup>[2]</sup>\"\n\nWith that said, he left without looking back, walking into the darkness.\n\nThe boy chased out, leaping onto a rooftop, and saw 749 investigators fighting Qi Refiners from Black Mountain Village in the distance.\n\nYe Li clenched his fists.\n\n749!!!\n\nWhy? Why must you eradicate us so completely? Black Mountain Village just wanted to live like normal people.\n\nWhy must it be like this!!\n\nJust because we were bandits for a day, does that mean we're bandits for life?\n\nWhy won't you give us freedom?\n\nAs he thought about this, he completely failed to remember that a normal life had once been laid out before them, but they had refused, finding the rules and laws down the mountain too restrictive.\n\nThey felt living wasn't free.\n\nNow they wanted freedom again, and they'd caused a whole heap of trouble. In Lu Ding's words: \"Do you even deserve it?\"\n\nThe boy, tears in his eyes, turned and vanished into the darkness, rushing towards the cliff.\n\nA new lease on life from a dead end – where on Black Mountain Village could be more desperate than the cliff?\n\nBlack Mountain Village entrance.\n\nSomeone arrived riding the wind, and heaven and earth echoed: \"Shi Lei, today I shall surely cut you down!!!\"\n\nLu Ding appeared from the dense forest, finishing the sentence: \"Being old doesn't mean you can brag.\"\n\nAt the same time, the slash he had long charged to its limit burst forth. He paused backward, and the sensation of death clung to everyone's hearts.\n\nThe slash cut horizontally through the approaching figure, losing little of its power, and continued straight behind him. The mountains, forests, trees, grass, and rocks all simultaneously shrank by a section at that moment.\n\nFinally, it cut over the mountaintop, and the slash dissipated into the night sky, as rocks rumbled down from the peak.\n\nLu Ding shook his slightly numb palm, looking at the distant mountain that had been shaved flat. For a second, he was astonished by the power of this move.\n\nIt was terrifyingly much stronger than when he had used it at Spirit Sea Fifth Layer.\n\nThe only thing was, it couldn't be charged for too long; it somewhat damaged the meridians. He'd need at least a few minutes to recover.\n\nThen he looked at the old man who had been hit.\n\nBlood seeped from his waist, his body shifted, and internal organs slipped out from between his upper and lower halves.\n\nThe expressions of Black Mountain Village's Qi Refiners changed instantly.\n\nSurprise turned to terror, confidence to stupefaction.\n\nThey watched him build his crimson towers, they watched him feast his guests, they watched his towers collapse<sup>[3]</sup>. Ye Chengfeng's appearance had been their reassuring pill; as long as he was there, nothing would go wrong.\n\nHe had led them, these remnants of an old era, to survive the chaotic times, riding into battle with drawn swords, drinking huge bowls of wine, eating big chunks of meat, and filling their coffers with gold and silver.\n\nHe had also led them through the bandit suppression campaigns of Great Black Mountain, signing agreements not to descend the mountain, returning to normalcy, tilling the land with their faces to the soil and backs to the sky.\n\nThey had lived for decades, day in and day out, decades considered a single plan.\n\nTo place a piece was freedom; to conquer heaven was escape.\n\nThe result.....\n\n749 somehow discovered their plan, or perhaps they had come to encircle and suppress them without cause.\n\nYe Chengfeng, the bandit leader who had reigned supreme for half his life.\n\nHe actually fell at the hands of an unfamiliar half-grown kid.\n\nSplit in two, severed at the waist; heart, liver, spleen, and lungs spilling from his gut.\n\nA mournful, tragic cry: \"Big Brother!!!!\"\n\nAnother slash rose with the wind. Ye Chengfeng, who had been lying on the ground, split in two, instantly opened his eyes and rolled, dodging it.\n\nRaising a hand, his fingers intertwined into a spell.\n\nHis lower half, which had been lying quietly on the ground, gradually disappeared, only to reappear as a faint outline beneath him, slowly solidifying.\n\nBut the hand he used for the spell began to fill with cracks, its color fading at a visible rate until it became a ghastly white, mud-clay-like texture.\n\nThe patterns on it were like fine wrinkles and grooves, vividly lifelike. One couldn't tell if it was a hand that resembled mud-clay, or mud-clay that resembled a hand.\n\nA hundred slashes erupted from Lu Ding's hand, cutting towards him, without a single word.\n\nYe Chengfeng dodged, but his speed was visibly no match for an average Divine Palace Realm expert. Finally, his lower half was hit by a slash and shattered, with no blood flowing, only mud-ash flying.\n\n\"How did you know I wasn't dead?\"\n\nHe stared steadily at the hovering young man and asked.\n\nHuman voice and wind intertwined.\n\n\"You talk too much nonsense, just like your two dead grandsons.\"\n\n\"You are Lu Ding!!!\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Ye Chengfeng's aura instantly became chaotic.\n\nThis was the effect Lu Ding wanted. If raw power couldn't solve it in one go, then he would have to use his brains.\n\nThey say fists fear the young and strong, and staffs fear the old and experienced.\n\nThe latter part was similar when applied to techniques. Compared to his peers, Lu Ding's advantage lay in his various max-level techniques and his super-large Spirit Sea that crushed those of the same realm.\n\nBut against Ye Chengfeng, this old bandit who had lived for over a hundred years, Lu Ding didn't hold much of an advantage. In terms of techniques, he might have a slight edge, but not much; the old man had his age, his cultivation, his realm.\n\nOnly his physical body was missing half.\n\nIn this situation, Lu Ding's only advantage was his physical body. He had just tested it with those few slashes: this old man's physical body wasn't too good, likely due to old age and infirmity, and now he was missing half his body, making it inconvenient to cast spells.\n\nDirect close-quarters combat, giving no opportunities, relying on a stubbornly tenacious<sup>[4]</sup> \"wear down the old man\" tactic—it officially began!\n\nSpells to attack the body, words to attack the mind.\n\nSlashes cleared the way, as Lu Ding pressed forward with his physical body. Fists and feet moved simultaneously, leaving afterimages. His punches were hammers, his elbows knives. His attacks aimed to gouge eyes and lock throats, while his counter-moves were headlocks and knee strikes.\n\nSparrowhawk Somersault, Green Dragon Claws—he used a medley of deadly techniques, employing vicious and ruthless moves, relying on his strong and robust physique to bully the old, weak, sick, and disabled opponent.\n\n---\n<sup>[1]</sup> \"You cannot want both this and that\" (既要又要 - jì yào yòu yào) is an idiom meaning to want two desirable but mutually exclusive things.\n<sup>[2]</sup> \"A new lease on life from a dead end\" (绝处逢生 - juéchù féngshēng) is an idiom meaning to find a way out of a desperate situation, or to have a narrow escape and survive.\n<sup>[3]</sup> \"They watched him build his crimson towers, they watched him feast his guests, they watched his towers collapse\" (眼见他起朱楼，眼见他宴宾客，眼见他楼塌了 - yǎnkàn tā qǐ zhūlóu, yǎnkàn tā yànbīnkè, yǎnkàn tā lóu tā le) is a famous Chinese idiom from Kunqu opera, used to describe the rise and fall of someone or something, often implying the inevitability of a downfall after a period of prosperity.\n<sup>[4]</sup> \"Stubbornly tenacious\" (活蜕活生耍赖 - huó tuì huó shēng shuǎlài) implies a relentless, hard-to-kill, and perhaps slightly underhanded fighting style that persists shamelessly.",

    "content": "Ye Chengfeng felt aggrieved, yet had nowhere to vent. He could only endure the beating, with no strength to retaliate.\n\nAsk why?\n\nNaturally, because he was missing half of his left side.\n\nHe hadn't expected Lu Ding to attack Great Black Mountain at all.\n\nIt should have been him seeking revenge, right?\n\nBut as it turned out, Lu Ding came knocking first.\n\nAnd he let Shi Lei fight head-on while he himself hid.\n\nWhen Ye Chengfeng emerged, his original plan was to kill Shi Lei, then hold off the others so Ye Li could escape. As for himself, how could he possibly run away?\n\nHaving spent his entire life on this Great Black Mountain, he might as well die here.\n\nIt was just that his grandson's revenge hadn't been exacted yet.\n\nAlthough he was prepared, this was too different from what he'd imagined. Lu Ding actually came, didn't say a word upon appearing, and immediately launched a killing move, severing him at the waist.\n\nHe almost went to the Western Heavens.\n\nFortunately, he had a secret technique to transfer injuries.\n\nBut the result was losing half his body.\n\nThis caused his combat strength to decrease by more than half. If he could create distance and engage in a spell duel, with his Fate Overseer Realm cultivation, he might still have a chance to win.\n\nBut now Lu Ding gave him no such opportunity, clinging to him like a dog-skin plaster and refusing to let go.\n\nHe couldn't run, nor could he disengage.\n\nThis kid could fly!\n\nHis hand techniques were diverse, he knew a bit of everything, and he became more cunning and seasoned the longer he fought.\n\nPunch after punch, move after move, relying on his powerful physique, he beat Ye Chengfeng miserably.\n\nYe Chengfeng was furious.\n\nLu Ding clearly possessed such powerful spells, yet he insisted on fighting him in close quarters, angering Ye Chengfeng.\n\nYe Chengfeng abandoned his defense, directly enduring a punch from Lu Ding. He raised his hand into a claw, moved up Lu Ding's arm, and directly clawed at the soft flesh of Lu Ding's Futu Acupoint near his collarbone.\n\nSeeing that the old man had the same idea as himself – to trade injuries and then use a spell to transfer the damage.\n\nA slight curve appeared on Lu Ding's lips. Wasn't it just a few chunks of rotten flesh?\n\nIf you want it, take it.\n\nA punch landed on Ye Chengfeng's chest, breaking his sternum, while a large chunk of flesh was torn from Lu Ding's shoulder.\n\nYe Chengfeng stumbled back, standing upright, and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.\n\n\"Your Futu Acupoint suffered a heavy blow, doesn't feel good, does it?\"\n\nAs he spoke, a spell circulated, transferring the injury to other parts of his body. Another large patch of his skin discolored, but it wasn't as severe as before.\n\nLu Ding looked at his injured shoulder.\n\n\"It really doesn't feel good. You pinched me sore.\"\n\nHe raised his hand, grabbed the injured flesh, and ripped it off fiercely. It was like a snake shedding its old skin, which he then casually threw to the ground. Looking at the injured area near Lu Ding's collarbone again.\n\nHis skin was supple and smooth; the injury was gone.\n\nOnly the flesh Ye Chengfeng still held in his hand and the dead skin on the ground could prove that Lu Ding had been injured.\n\nWhen the old man saw this, his face instantly darkened.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, fine, fine, fine! You pinched me! Sore!! Why didn't you just pinch me to death!!\"\n\nYe Chengfeng was shocked and furious. Shocked that he hadn't expected Lu Ding to also possess such a recovery method, and one even more exaggerated than his own.\n\nFurious that his trade-off attack had completely shattered his sternum and transferring the injury had cost him a large chunk of flesh, and Lu Ding told him he was \"pinched sore\"!?\n\nLu Ding found these words somewhat familiar.\n\nHe suddenly remembered that Yuan Baifeng, who used the Great Strength Vajra Palm back then, seemed to have said something similar.\n\nBack then, Lu Ding had said he was \"beaten red.\"\n\nLu Ding pressed forward again.\n\nLu Ding's advantage grew. Ye Chengfeng, who was already struggling, became even more dishevelled. He felt aggrieved, unable to exert even a shred of his own advantages.\n\nThe art of psychological warfare lay in words, expressions, and tactics.\n\nYe Chengfeng's thoughts were chaotic, and he was seething with anger. Lu Ding's psychological warfare worked again, causing Ye Chengfeng's footing to fall into complete disarray.\n\nLu Ding intentionally revealed a flaw, and the man indeed raised his hand to seize his throat.\n\nHe took the opportunity to press down and break Ye Chengfeng's arm.\n\n\"Argh!!!\"\n\nA pained cry rang out. Lu Ding pressed his advantage, delivering a horizontal elbow strike to the jaw. With that single elbow, the old man's consciousness instantly blurred, and teeth and bone fragments flew.\n\nHis head, heavily struck, violently snapped to the side, looking at the ground with blurred vision.\n\nThen, a knee strike came directly to his face.\n\nCRACK!!!!\n\nYe Chengfeng suffered another heavy blow, throwing his head back as blood splattered. Because Lu Ding's strength was too great, this strike almost completely caved in his entire face.\n\nThen he saw a hand reach out, grab his head by the hair, and forcefully push it down.\n\nLu Ding raised his arm high, clenched his fist, and brought it down with a whistling sound. Behind him, a shadowy bear beast roared in the darkness, and veins bulged on his forehead.\n\nThis strike showed he used all his strength.\n\nBOOM!!!!!\n\nA circular shockwave spread out, sweeping away fallen leaves within a hundred meters.\n\nThen, looking at the ground in front of Lu Ding.\n\nYe Chengfeng's back was bent backwards into a grotesque arc, as he lay sprawled on the cracked ground.\n\nHe kept making rasping sounds, seemingly with last words to utter, but he couldn't say anything before his breath ran out.\n\nA breeze swept by, and Lu Ding delivered the final blow.\n\nThus, Ye Chengfeng, the Bandit Chief of his generation, brought down the curtain on his life.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand in front of him, blew on the silver hairs in his palm, which scattered with the wind. \"Done for the day,\" he said.\n\nBefore the fight, he thought Ye Chengfeng would be much fiercer—the Bandit Chief, Bandit King, the tyrant of Great Black Mountain. But as it turned out... the Path of Live Sloughing and Live Corpse was only used once.\n\nAnd it was only for a minor injury.\n\nFortunately, Ye Chengfeng didn't know what he was thinking. If he did, he would probably leap up from the ground.\n\nPointing at his nose, cursing:\n\n\"First, you surprise-attacked with a slash. Then, you engaged in close-quarters combat. With your strong physique, you bullied my old, weak, sick, and disabled self.\n\nYour moves were like a sudden storm, one after another without any wasted words. Your attacks were like rain lashing plantain leaves, a punch followed by a kick, giving no chance at all.\n\nHow the hell am I supposed to fight you!!!?\n\nTell me!!!?\"\n\nBeside them, Shi Lei's battle was also nearing its end. Just now, when Ye Chengfeng's defeat became apparent, Shi Lei had been furiously attacking the other Great Black Mountain Qi Refiners.\n\nThese people couldn't defeat him to begin with, and their morale was affected by Ye Chengfeng's defeat, so how could they possibly survive?\n\nWith the matter here resolved.\n\nLu Ding turned and headed to Black Wind Cave.\n\nSpeaking of Black Wind Cave, it was formerly the lair of that group of bandits from Black Mountain Village.\n\nIt was about two kilometers behind the village.\n\nCobwebs covered the cave, and weeds grew profusely outside.\n\nLu Ding walked inside, taking dozens of steps before it suddenly opened up.\n\nA familiar scent lingered, the scent of Shi Gandang, whom he had assisted Li Xuanlong in killing that night.\n\nFollowing the scent, Lu Ding found himself beneath the stone chair where the bandit chief sat. He looked down and saw an iron box stuck to the underside of the chair.\n\nHe reached out, unlatched it, and opened it.\n\nInside was a piece of paper, stained with Shi Gandang's fingerprints, stamped with several 749 official seals: \"With this item, you may exchange for one True Scripture at any 749 branch.\"\n\n\"So I have a cultivation method now, don't I?\"\n\nOriginally, he had said he would find a good one when he got to the training location. Now, a free one had appeared, which meant he could save a lot and use it to exchange for cultivation resources.\n\n\"True Scripture\" was also called \"True Scripture Secret Transmission,\" derived from the saying \"discarding falsehoods and returning to truth, deconstructing the body to become immortal.\"\n\nOf course, \"deconstructing the body to become immortal\" here did not mean dismemberment, but rather unraveling the secret of human cultivation to become immortal.\n\nIt was a path that sought certainties from various uncertainties, allowing for steady improvement with minimal risk and maximum benefit.\n\nTechniques like the Corpse Release Immortal, the Sitting Jar Method, and the Path of Live Sloughing and Live Corpse were all types of True Scripture Secret Arts.\n\nLu Ding hadn't witnessed other methods, but he had personally seen the Path of Live Sloughing and Live Corpse, even though it was the worst tier among True Scripture Secret Arts.\n\nYet, it was this worst thing.\n\nIt could actually give people from hundreds of years ago, or even further back, a chance to live another life.\n\nAlthough after living again \"I\" would no longer be \"me,\" how was this not a secret art of longevity that could evade the changes of years and the passage of time?\n\nIt's just that the positioning of this True Scripture Secret Art was slightly awkward: if one didn't practice it, one would die of old age, illness, or severe, untreatable injuries when one's lifespan ran out.\n\nBut if one did practice it, one would essentially be crippled.\n\nIt belonged to the category of \"if you don't practice it, this life is over; if you practice it, this life is also over.\"\n\nIt offered a sliver of fantasy, but this fantasy was set high, and in the end, there were always hesitant people who wanted to give it a try.\n\nAnd then, try it and you'll die.\n\nHere, Lu Ding obtained the voucher for exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side.",

    "title": "Chapter 113: The Grenade of the Qishi Grenade exploded, and it almost made you run away",
    "content": "Ye Li fled all the way towards the back mountain precipice. Along the way, various 749 investigators ambushed and raided, countless killing intents brushed past him.\n\nBut in the end, the other Black Mountain Village Qi Cultivators who covered his escape took these life-or-death crises in his stead.\n\nCries of \"Run!!\" \"Run!!!\" that tore at the heart and lungs, were heart-rending, tear-inducing.\n\nAfter a 749 investigator raised his palm and killed a person, he wiped a mouthful of blood from the corner of his mouth and pursued Ye Li in the direction he had fled again.\n\nOn the way, he cursed:\n\n\"I really don't understand, a bunch of bandits, why are you making it so tragic?\"\n\n\"As if we're indiscriminately killing innocents, don't you know what you've done?\"\n\n\"My great-grandfather was killed by you dogs before, now you're pretending to be victims, the more I look, the sicker I get, damn it!!\"\n\nThe figure fleeing in the darkness ahead kept turning and dodging, as if he had opened his Heavenly Eye, consistently bypassing and evading the laid traps.\n\nThe precipice was getting closer.\n\nThe sound of the wind rustled the swaying leaves.\n\nHe slammed to a halt, sending pebbles flying into the precipice, with no echo for a long time.\n\nYe Li looked back.\n\nThe investigator who had previously grumbled was already in pursuit: \"Run, run again.\"\n\nAt this moment, Ye Li had nowhere to run or hide. Looking at the bottomless abyss again, his heart was filled with mixed emotions.\n\nBlind Granny, I'm already in a desperate situation now, where exactly is the \"finding life in despair\" that you spoke of......\n\nHe turned around.\n\nHe looked at the 749 investigator slowly approaching.\n\nYe Li's eyes were resolute: \"Even if I die, I won't die by your hands!!!\"\n\nWith that, he turned and leaped, rapidly falling towards the bottom of the precipice.\n\nThe investigator's heart jolted. He swiftly stepped forward, quickly grabbing a controller with one hand and taking out a Qi Cultivator-lethal grenade from the bureau with the other.\n\nHe pulled the pin, then jumped down, adjusting his posture in mid-air, counting silently in his mind, and suddenly threw the grenade.\n\nThen came a bang!!!\n\nThe grenade exploded in mid-air, accompanied by the figure's disintegration. The investigator pressed the controller again.\n\nImmediately, dense explosions and fluctuations of Spiritual Qi, triggered by various array disks, came from below.\n\nThe terrifying power caused rubble to continuously fall from both sides of the precipice. Under the shaking of the mountain, the huge commotion woke many villagers down the mountain.\n\nEveryone had different thoughts..\n\n\"An earthquake in the mountains?\" \"A mudslide in the mountains?\" \"The old monster in the mountains has emerged?\"\n\nAll sorts of rumors would begin to fly rampant starting tomorrow morning, but later, due to the public announcement of the relocation report from above, they received a reasonable explanation.\n\nLooking back at the precipice.\n\nThe investigator who had triggered the grenade explosion in mid-air hung from the cliff using a grappling hook from his sleeve.\n\nWitnessing everything, he couldn't help but say: \"Fortunately, Special Commissioner Lu gave us a heads-up, otherwise I really wouldn't have expected this kid to jump off the cliff so decisively.\"\n\nIf he had jumped down even a little slower, Ye Li would have fallen further and disappeared into the clouds and mist below, out of his sight.\n\nThe investigator climbed up the cliff and walked into the dense forest.\n\nBy the time the battlefield was cleared, it was already past five, almost six in the morning, and dawn was about to break.\n\nShi Lei walked over to report: \"Special Commissioner Lu, I've already sent the message down. Around eight o'clock, the staff below will come up the mountain to carry out the village relocation plan.\"\n\n\"You've worked hard tonight. I understand your situation; sometimes it's normal to be beyond one's control. In the report, I will truthfully record all circumstances.\"\n\nListening to Lu Ding's words, Shi Lei slightly lowered his gaze, his mood somewhat low.\n\nOnce the report went up, his directorship would likely be over.....\n\nBefore he could ponder what punishment he might face, he heard Lu Ding continue.\n\n\"But in the 'Special Commissioner's Factual Investigation Report' column, I will write: Director of Kaoshan City 749 Branch, Shi Lei, actively cooperated with the mission.\"\n\n\"In the battle against the evil forces of Daheishan, he led by example, taking the lead.\"\n\n\"He fought through injury to buy me valuable time to kill Ye Chengfeng. Yunhai 749 Special Investigator Lu Ding hereby applies to the branch for him to be awarded a Third-Class Personal Merit Medal.\"\n\nShi Lei abruptly looked up.\n\nHe could hardly believe his ears.\n\nHe looked at Lu Ding's expression again.\n\nHe immediately clutched his chest, hunched his back, feigning injury, and weakly said: \"Thank you, Special Commissioner.\"\n\n\"At least make your act a bit more convincing.\" Lu Ding's voice held a hint of laughter.\n\nThere really wasn't much to say about Shi Lei as a director. Zhou Yun's matter was entirely a mere formality under his purview.\n\nOne was an official investigator from Yunhai Branch, and the other was a deputy director from the same institute. The fact that he knew some details was purely out of courtesy from them.\n\nSo Lu Ding could understand this matter, but it was impossible to conceal it. The higher-ups weren't blind. While Lu Ding could indeed conceal it, the problem here wasn't big, and the higher-ups likely wouldn't pursue it.\n\nHowever, it's better not to do such things if possible; doing them too often easily loses goodwill.\n\nTherefore, the best method was to first achieve merit, then be penalized for wrongdoing.\n\nLu Ding had seen his file before; he was just short of a promotion.\n\nSo this Third-Class Merit would be enough for him to jump up a bit.\n\nHowever, Zhou Yun's matter was also enough for him to be demoted one rank, or directly stripped of his badge. But if the merit came first and the transgression afterward, he would basically remain unchanged, just as he was now.\n\nKaoshan City still needed someone experienced, capable, and ethical to oversee it. It wouldn't do for Lu Ding to leave and have both the director and deputy director of Kaoshan City replaced, starting everything from scratch.\n\nFinishing the job and then running off, completely disregarding the consequences, that's not honorable.\n\nShi Lei chuckled beside him: \"It was indeed a bit fake, thank you for the guidance, Special Commissioner Lu.\"\n\nIf Shi Lei had been impressed by Lu Ding's talent and strength before,\n\nthen now he was convinced by Lu Ding's methods of handling matters.\n\nThis is truly where law and reason are not separate from human sentiment. (1)\n\nIt was already afternoon by the time they finished dealing with the matters of Daheishan.\n\nLu Ding didn't delay. He politely declined Shi Lei's farewell banquet and returned to Yunhai 749 with Qiu Wangshui and Zhou Yun, who were still unconscious.\n\nWhen the two of them groggily woke up, their surroundings had already changed.\n\nBefore them were Lu Ding and staff members from the 749 Investigative Tribunal.\n\nSeeing them, Qiu Wangshui instantly lost all spirit, and Zhou Yun's eyes darted around in panic.\n\n\"This... where is this?\"\n\nLu Ding ignored him, turning to leave. He was only responsible for arrests, not for legal education or confrontation.\n\nHe knew even by thinking with his toes (2) that once he engaged with this person, he would have to question himself.\n\nWhat happened to my grandfather~ What happened to my uncle~ What happened to my so-and-so~ What did you do to them~\n\nAnd if his speech was a bit more idiotic,\n\nHe would even say, they were bandits before, but they've changed for the better now. They used to kill, but they don't kill now.\n\nAnd even if you produced evidence of these people causing trouble, he would still hit you with, \"I don't believe it!!\"\n\n\"It's all fake, they were so good to me, so simple and honest,\" and so on and so forth.\n\nThis was also why Lu Ding only lifted their Spiritual Qi suppression after returning to Yunhai 749 and in front of the staff.\n\nOnce the report was submitted and the details explained,\n\nit was no longer Lu Ding's business. There were plenty of people to confront the two of them. Why waste words? Just lock them up.\n\nHe turned and went to Logistics, seeing Director Deng with a smile on his face.\n\nThe first thing he said was: \"Little Lu, you're here? Have you eaten?\"\n\nA warm current flowed through Lu Ding's heart, and he told a small lie: \"Yes, I have. Have you eaten?\"\n\n\"You knew I was coming?\"\n\nThe old man waved, signaling him to come over: \"Things have to come from my end, so why wouldn't I be informed beforehand?\"\n\n\"I've already eaten lunch. Come on, I'll show you.\"\n\nAmong the three branch offices in the South, Lu Ding couldn't possibly go to other places to exchange for the True Understanding.\n\nSo he still had to return to Yunhai 749.\n\nInside the Library Building.\n\nLu Ding followed Elder Deng up to the second floor.\n\nAfter verifying their identity information, they entered.\n\nGreeting them were various glass display cases, filled with all sorts of items: Buddhist beads, writing brushes, longswords.\n\nThere were pictorial books, and also strange bones of unknown type or origin.\n\nThese.\n\nAll were True Understanding Secret Arts.\n\n---\n(1) 法理不外乎人情 (fǎ lǐ bù wài hū rén qíng): An idiom meaning that while laws and principles are important, they should also consider human compassion and practical circumstances.

    "content": "True Solution Secret Arts are not naturally formed; they are basically things that later generations gradually discovered during their continuous cultivation process.\n\nThey are the crystallization of experience from individual pioneering cultivators.\n\nAnd these preserved items were left behind by other powerful cultivators of True Solutions.\n\nThrough special means, a trace of the former's experience is preserved, which can aid in comprehension.\n\nThis is the advantage of leaning on the mighty tree that is 749.\n\nOf course, there are also things recorded in ancient texts.\n\nBut as the saying goes, a true teaching is a single sentence, a false teaching fills ten thousand books. Studying it a hundred times yourself is not as good as someone else guiding you through it once.\n\nAside from these physical True Solutions, 749's databases are interconnected, preserving various True Solution Secret Methods recorded in text.\n\nSome physical copies are in other branch bureaus or the headquarters, while others only have text records remaining, but explanatory videos can be purchased.\n\nLu Ding's gaze swept across.\n\nInformation came into view.\n\n【Cold Toad Jade Book】\n\n【Swallowing and exhaling moon essence, condensing the image of the cold moon, shaping the body of the Moon God....】\n\n.....\n\n【Green Mountain Secret Scroll】\n\n【Green mountains never age, remaining motionless despite the changing of time.....】\n\n.....\n\n【Divine Ridge Secret Record: Soul Condensing Supreme Volume】\n\n....\n\nThe sheer variety of True Solution Secret Methods truly overwhelmed Lu Ding.\n\nHe genuinely didn't know which one to choose in such a short time.\n\nElder Deng looked at him, slightly conflicted: \"What kind of True Solution Secret Method are you looking for? Do you have any general direction in mind?\"\n\nLu Ding thought for a moment, considering his own situation. Since he could manually toggle the Unity of Heaven and Man, he naturally couldn't choose some run-of-the-mill stuff.\n\n\"No special standard, just strong enough will do.\"\n\nThis simple and blunt standard made Elder Deng tilt his head and ponder: \"Strong enough... come over and take a look at this.\"\n\nHe led Lu Ding deeper, finally stopping in front of a glass display cabinet containing bones.\n\nIt was fist-sized, irregularly shaped, entirely jade-colored, and imbued with blood.\n\n【Evil Dragon Bone Seal】\n\n【The Evil Dragon brought disaster by carrying rivers, seeking to go to the sea to cleanse its evil. It swept the waters of three rivers into the sea, but was later slain at the Three Rivers Estuary. This bone, found beneath its reverse scale, records its method.....】\n\n【Note: Although this method is incredibly powerful, it deeply plants roots of evil, fostering an evil nature and creating grave sins. Only two types of individuals can cultivate it:】\n\n【One: The Heavenly Doom Lone Star, disliked by heaven and earth, cursing others and oneself, bringing death to six relatives and misfortune in all directions—those who bring disaster wherever they go can practice the Evil Dragon's method without suffering its sins.】\n\nLu Ding:.......\n\nThat sounded surprisingly nice. Didn't it just mean, 'when you have many lice, you don't feel the itch,' or that if you already owe a billion, another ten million makes no difference?\n\n【Two: Those favored by Heaven's Will, who are unrestricted by anything.】\n\nSeeing this line, Lu Ding instantly perked up. It was as if it was specially prepared for a novel's protagonist; it was too perfect.\n\nNow that he'd seen it first, it was his.\n\nFavored by Heaven's Will?\n\nLu Ding secretly made a decision.\n\nFrom today onwards, his Unity of Heaven and Man would no longer have an off button!\n\n\"Before, I saw you were fortunate enough to have the Unity of Heaven and Man descend upon you. This Evil Dragon Bone Seal should be quite suitable for you, but you must be careful when cultivating this method.\"\n\n\"You absolutely must be careful not to be influenced by it, after all, you can't always receive the blessing and support of the Unity of Heaven and Man.\"\n\n\"It's better to be safe than sorry.\"\n\nElder Deng saw Lu Ding's eagerness, which was why he spoke this way.\n\nAs for persuading him not to learn it?\n\nIsn't the path of cultivation all about striving? Strive when there's a chance, strive when there's a possibility. Who doesn't rise step by step through struggle?\n\nIs there really someone who gets spoon-fed by Heaven, their cultivation increasing out of thin air?\n\nWhat a joke.\n\n\"Don't worry, Elder Deng, I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nElder Deng nodded, then raised his hand and pressed it onto the glass display cabinet. Invisible talismans on it began to manifest their mysterious power, and the display cabinet slowly separated to both sides.\n\nThe pedestal inside rose.\n\n\"Take it.\"\n\nOnly then did Lu Ding, having received permission, reach out and take the dragon bone.\n\nThe moment it entered his hand, a restless feeling rose from Lu Ding's heart, but it completely vanished after only a moment.\n\nOnly after seeing this scene did Elder Deng feel relieved enough to close the display cabinet.\n\n\"Go quickly and comprehend it. Time waits for no one. It'll probably be a few more days until all the students arrive at the Advanced Study Grounds, so if it's too late, I'll call you.\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding's heart was filled with mixed emotions.\n\nIn a trance, he was back in his childhood in his previous life, on a cold, sleepy winter morning for school, not wanting to get up at all.\n\nThe old person was busy in the kitchen, saying, \"Then you can sleep a bit longer, it's still early. I'll call you when it's time to eat, remember to get up then.\"\n\nLu Ding nodded: \"Okay.\"\n\nLeaving the Logistics Department, he returned to his single dormitory.\n\nLu Ding sat cross-legged on the bed. He wasn't going to switch cultivation methods right away, but rather to comprehend it a bit, get a feel for it, and see its effects.\n\nIt was like when new clothes arrive; even if you don't wear them, you still try them on.\n\nAs spiritual energy stimulated...\n\nThe scene before his eyes transformed.\n\nLu Ding floated in the sky. At this moment, he was observing the Evil Dragon carrying rivers to the sea from a third-person perspective.\n\nAmong high mountains and steep ridges, there was lightning and thunder. The sky was covered in dark clouds, and water vapor condensed. As distant mountain peaks collapsed, rubble flew everywhere.\n\nThat black figure rushed out from within the mountain.\n\nA torrential rain fell from the sky.\n\nClouds and mist drew near, half-concealing its body within them, its full form obscured.\n\nAs lightning brought light, the Evil Dragon moved within it, all in the blink of an eye.\n\nHalf a dragon head revealed its true form, its two eyes with chaotic pupils fully displaying its fierce power. Its dragon scales shimmered with a faint glow, and its dragon claws gleamed with a cold light.\n\nCausing bursts of heavenly thunder to sound, startling beasts across a thousand *li* to scatter.\n\nCarrying evil clouds, its fierce power pulsed and demonic energy surged, startling birds from a thousand mountains to flee.\n\nEnveloping river water, it covered the sky and earth, rushing down mountains, toppling trees, and obscuring traces of people on ten thousand paths.\n\nLooking around, floods surged to the sky, and desolation filled his vision.\n\nListening in all directions, wails of sorrow filled the fields, and living beings were plunged into misery.\n\nWhat Lu Ding saw with his eyes and heard with his ears, his heart had some realization, and the spiritual energy within his body began to circulate.\n\nA day passed in an instant.\n\nEarly the next morning.\n\nDeep within Qinanze, the Advanced Study Grounds, right next to Bannan State, welcomed many new faces.\n\nAll were geniuses from various districts. As the saying goes, one mountain cannot hold two tigers, unless one is male and one is female.\n\nWhen geniuses meet, sparks are bound to fly.\n\n749 divides itself into eight major districts: East, West, South, North, Southeast, Northeast, Southwest, and Northwest. The main city of each of these major districts has its own branch bureau.\n\nThese genius investigators, hailing from all corners of the land, would band together by their respective major districts.\n\nSince they were all from the same major district, it wasn't strange for them to have heard each other's names or had some interactions.\n\nAs mentioned before, not every major district would have all advanced study students go together to collect their advanced study rewards.\n\nThere were also students who understood their own situation and didn't want to take this risk. Although they wouldn't die, if they ended up with a severe injury, it wouldn't be worth it.\n\nThese students who didn't go to collect their advanced study rewards would arrive at the location first.\n\n\"Since I arrived first, I can choose the courtyard to live in first, right?\"\n\nFirst come, first served. After all, the courtyards differed in size, and their orientations and layouts also differed.\n\n\"Since I've already chosen, it's not too much for me to choose one for my colleague from my bureau who went to collect the advanced study rewards, right?\"\n\nThis was just like Yan Feifan going out to eat and arriving first to save a seat for Lu Ding.\n\nFrom your perspective, there's no problem, but from others' perspective, this was a huge problem!\n\nBai Hemian took something different from Lu Ding, and arrived at the Advanced Study Grounds relatively quickly.\n\nWhen he found that Lu Ding hadn't arrived yet, he thought of choosing a courtyard first.\n\nThe result was that he liked one, but others said it was taken. He liked a second, but others said that was also taken. A third, still taken.\n\nBai Hemian immediately flared up on the spot. \"Isn't this just bullying an honest person!\"\n\n\"Taken? The doors are all locked, and you're telling me someone's there?\"\n\nThat person crossed their arms: \"Uh-huh, yeah, the person isn't here, but I reserved the courtyard for them.\"\n\nThen... Bai Hemian went for it, fighting with much clatter from the front yard to the back, from men to women, from the Northwest to the Southeast. In the end, he provoked a whole crowd.\n\nAlthough he was strong, he wasn't strong enough to have Lu Ding's overwhelming lead over his peers.\n\nAt most, other geniuses were at the foot of the mountain, he was halfway up, and Lu Ding was flying in the sky.\n\nMoreover, the Yi Wood Knot had not expended all its efficacy.\n\nFacing several geniuses attacking him together, although he wasn't injured, he was a bit overwhelmed; it wasn't a one-on-one duel where he could take them on individually.\n\nNobody was stupid; they knew one person couldn't beat him. Even a good dog can't fight off a pack of rabid ones.\n\nAs it happened, all the students from the Southern Great District went to collect their advanced study rewards, and since that was a difficult task, no one else from his district had arrived yet besides him.\n\nAlthough he couldn't beat them, after these days with Lu Ding, he had, through subtle influence, learned a principle.\n\nIt's foolish to suffer needlessly.\n\nHe directly slipped into the shadows, ran to a deserted spot, pulled out his phone, opened the 749 APP, and sent a message to Lu Ding.\n\n\"Ganging up on me, overwhelmed, extremely urgent.\"",

    "content": ".....\n\nIt was noon.\n\nLu Ding woke up slowly, spiritual energy rampaging wildly through his meridians and acupoints, flowing ceaselessly.\n\n\"Once I reach the advanced training facility, I'll find a way to use good heaven-and-earth treasures and rush straight into the Divine Palace!\"\n\nHis thoughts settled.\n\nThis Baleful Dragon Bone Inscription was simply much more powerful than the original Flying Bear Pouncing Kill Method.\n\nThere was just one problem.\n\nNo Divine Palace, no Baleful Dragon.\n\nThe Divine Palace realm, as the name suggests, involves constructing a Divine Palace within one's body, building an image of one's deity, and preserving one's true self.\n\nBuild my god, cultivate my method, slay my enemy, forge my Dao.\n\nThat is the Divine Palace.\n\nEach person who breaks through to the Divine Palace realm will manifest different things based on their cultivation method, physique, and other reasons.\n\nThe most direct example is Liu Xingchuan, the Branch Master of the Heavenly Principle Sect; his eye with a mouth, capable of harboring consciousness, was a unique aspect of his Divine Palace realm.\n\nAnother example is Shi Gandang's stone skin.\n\nAs for others, like Ye Chengfeng and his ilk, they couldn't even return a hand, how could they use a method?\n\nLiu Xingchuan, Lu Ding gave him a chance, otherwise, he would have settled it with one blow.\n\nAnd Lu Ding's Divine Palace Dao, as he now understood it, included but was not limited to two points.\n\nThat's right, two points.\n\nThe spell he acquired from Shi Gandang, the Baleful Suppressing Reincarnation Stele, and the Dragon-Binding Well that came with this Baleful Dragon Bone Inscription.\n\nThe Dragon-Binding Well confines the dragon in the abyss, imprisoning the Baleful Dragon like a method of accumulating power, gathering momentum. Once it reaches a certain point, it can soar to the sky, the dragon breaking free from the well.\n\nAs for the Baleful Suppressing Reincarnation Stele, this thing could be used for building the Dragon Gate.\n\nWhen the confined dragon breaks free from the well, it goes to the sea to cleanse its balefulness. This \"sea\" could also be the spiritual sea, and Lu Ding's spiritual sea was large enough for him to do whatever he wanted.\n\nWith the Baleful Suppressing Reincarnation Stele suppressing the winds and rains.\n\nIt was still the same phrase: if the Baleful Dragon could even stir up a single wave in his spiritual sea, that would mean the Baleful Suppressing Reincarnation Stele was napping because it hadn't slept well last night.\n\nShi Gandang might be a pushover, but this Baleful Suppressing Reincarnation Stele was not.\n\nOnce the Baleful Dragon had cleansed its balefulness and wished to transform into its true form, it would have to leap over the Dragon Gate.\n\nThe Baleful Suppressing Reincarnation Stele could just serve as the foundation for the Dragon Gate.\n\nFurthermore, once the Divine Palace was built, it could serve as a Heavenly Palace. Lu Ding had prepared a complete process for it, and later he could still identify shortcomings and add finishing touches.\n\nFor others, \"drawing water from three rivers to the sea\" meant guiding spiritual energy through the meridians. Other people's meridians might not withstand such terrifying impact.\n\nJust like the scenes Lu Ding had witnessed, afterward, there would likely only be devastation.\n\nBut his meridians...\n\nExcuse me, you can pass through however you like. Forget passing straight through, you can even pass sideways.\n\nUnder such conditions,\n\nLu Ding had already envisioned that his Divine Palace realm breakthrough would be incredibly smooth, smoother than anything before.\n\nOnce the Dragon-Binding Well was formed, his combat power in the Divine Palace realm would experience its first surge. The Baleful Dragon breaking free from the well would be the second surge, carrying the rivers to wash away balefulness in the sea would be the third surge, passing through the Dragon Gate the fourth surge, and finally ascending to the Heavenly Palace and entering the Divine Palace for an ultimate sublimation.\n\n\"The future truly fills me with anticipation.\"\n\nHe packed his clothes, essential items, and toiletries, then stuffed the small gifts Xie Shunnan had given him into his suitcase.\n\nLu Ding was ready to head to the advanced training facility.\n\nHe picked up his phone, intending to call for a private plane.\n\nHowever, Bai Hemian's message was at the very top.\n\n[Bai Hemian: Outnumbered, a single tree cannot stand, desperate situation]\n\nLu Ding's fingers flew.\n\nHe sent a message back.\n\n[Lu Ding: When I arrive, call them out, one by one, and beat them back]\n\n.....\n\nAt the same time.\n\nInside the advanced training facility, more and more investigators arrived at their destination.\n\nThe residual traces of the previous battle drew everyone's attention.\n\n\"What's going on? You guys already had a fight before we even arrived?\" Gao Han said, surveying the messy courtyard.\n\nA genius trainee from Lingnan 749, who was with him, chimed in, \"Brother Han, a kid in black came earlier and immediately set his eyes on the courtyard I reserved for you.\"\n\n\"Of course, I wasn't having it. Who doesn't have a bit of temper? So I gave him a good beating.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he rubbed his swollen eye socket, \"Don't look at me like this, he's worse off, beaten to the point he couldn't walk.\"\n\nGao Han glanced at him, \"If I didn't know your personality, I'd believe you. If you were really that fierce, he should be hanging from a tree by now.\"\n\n\"Why don't I see anyone from the Southern Three Districts?\"\n\nA young man carrying a wooden box large enough to cover half his body walked up, \"I heard earlier that their three districts held a martial arts competition, and two people, a Lu Ding and a Bai Hemian, got direct admission.\"\n\n\"They suppressed the geniuses of the three districts so much that no one dared to stand out, which is why they got direct admission. Why haven't they arrived yet?\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, people like that definitely want to get the advanced training rewards. As for why they haven't arrived yet...\"\n\n\"It's simple.\"\n\nGao Han slung an arm around the young man's shoulders, \"We're faster than them!\"\n\nZhu Yixuan shook his head, \"I've seen Lu Ding's deeds on our intranet. Killing a Divine Palace realm expert while only being in the spiritual sea realm, and an auxiliary Director of Fate killing a Director of Fate—these things can't be fake.\"\n\n\"True or false, we'll find out with a fight. Direct admission, I want to see just how strong one must be to get direct admission.\"\n\nThere was no one else here apart from the advanced trainees, so their conversation was naturally overheard by others.\n\nThey were all from 749.\n\nWith Lu Ding emerging from Yunhai, and after the three-district martial arts competition and the Shi Gandang incident, leaders from various districts had already warned them before they arrived.\n\nOf course, warnings are warnings. Parents also say not to eat spicy strips or drink soda, to play less on phones and sleep more, but how many people listen?\n\nThey were all geniuses, mainly characterized by a rebellious spirit.\n\nThe topic they sparked never stopped.\n\nAs more and more people settled into courtyards, leaving few good spots.\n\nIn the forest, Bai Hemian's phone chimed with a notification.\n\n[Lu Ding: I'll be there soon, meet me at the gate]\n\nBai Hemian put his phone away, stood up on a tree branch, tidied his appearance, straightened his collar, then darted towards the advanced training facility's main gate again.\n\nAt the gate, two people were smoking and chatting.\n\nOne of them nudged the other, \"Look, a newcomer again.\"\n\nThe other turned his head and saw it was Bai Hemian.\n\nHe flicked his half-smoked cigarette, and it burst into ash in the air, \"You dare to come back?\"\n\n\"Haven't had enough beatings, have you?!\"\n\nBai Hemian calmly surveyed himself up and down, \"Did you hit me?\"\n\nThe young man was immediately choked.\n\nThe person next to him, seeing his reaction, immediately rolled up his sleeves, \"Who do you think you are, so arrogant?\"\n\nThe young man who had just spoken stopped him, \"Don't go. The two of us can't handle him. Just now, a whole group of us almost couldn't handle him.\"\n\nJust now, they had only managed to chase Bai Hemian away by relying on their numbers.\n\nNow with just two people, don't even think about it, thinking about it only means losing.\n\n\"Alright, I admit you're stronger than me. Just you wait.\"\n\n\"Going to call for backup?\" Bai Hemian asked.\n\nThe young man held his phone and didn't deny it. If you can't win, calling for backup is normal, and fighting among trainees was allowed in the advanced training facility.\n\nAs long as no one was killed and no other trainees' dignity was insulted.\n\nIf there were no fights, how could this place be called an advanced training facility for genius investigators? It might as well be called a college entrance exam cram school.\n\n\"What? Scared? I won't call many, just Brother Han since he's back.\"\n\nBai Hemian raised a hand, \"Don't.\"",

    "content": "The two were somewhat bewildered.\n\nThey watched him pull a somewhat stiff smile: \"Don't call too few. Gather all those people from just now, and ideally, include that Brother Han you mentioned.\"\n\nIf there were too few, Lu Ding wouldn't enjoy himself, and Bai Hemian would feel embarrassed if he couldn't muster the morning's lineup. He pondered, thinking Lu Ding might make fun of him.\n\nBai Hemian's arrogant remark immediately made the two unable to hold back.\n\n\"What do you mean? You couldn't even beat those people before, and now you want to add more? Is that it?\"\n\n\"You're asking for a brawl, huh? Fine, you go ahead and call your people, I'll call mine.\"\n\nA \"chajia\" means a pre-arranged group fight. You don't care how many I call, and I won't care how many you call. Once people arrive, it's on. We'll fight until one side can't go on, or until someone comes out to mediate.\n\n\"You'll see him soon.\"\n\nBai Hemian looked up at the sky and uttered those words.\n\nAs that person's message went out, noisy footsteps soon echoed through the training ground. In truth, few among them actually intended to fight; most were just curious onlookers. People called people, and before they knew it, the crowd had grown.\n\nGao Han and Zhu Yixuan led the way. When they emerged, they saw only Bai Hemian. Gao Han couldn't help but ask: \"Just you?\"\n\nA breeze blew, sweeping fallen leaves and dust into a dance. As the person arrived, the wind ceased, allowing the hem of his clothes to sway gently and settle. The view slowly panned sideways. Behind Bai Hemian's handsome face, an even more striking visage appeared.\n\nHe answered calmly: \"Now there are two.\"\n\nFingers, as fair as spring onions and as clearly jointed as bamboo, rested on his shoulder. Lu Ding spoke: \"Still carrying the suitcase, let's make this quick.\"\n\nThe wooden sign nearby, which had just been swayed by the breeze, was still gently rocking. It listed the rules of the training ground.\n\n[Among students, no fatalities. Everyone is a colleague.]\n[Fighting is permitted, but no acts that insult personal dignity. Trash talk doesn't count.]\n[Wanton provocation is not prohibited, but those provoked may retaliate freely, responding to directness with directness, and to grievance with grievance.]\n[The strong enjoy special treatment, the weak receive only basic resources.]\n\nBai Hemian nodded: \"Alright, I have no problem with any of it.\"\n\nLu Ding stepped forward, his gaze sweeping over everyone present, finally settling on the leading Gao Han and Zhu Yixuan. Both were from the Southeast Greater Region. One practiced Top Incense Spirit Invocation, the other cultivated Loaned Blade Returning Intention.\n\nWhile he observed others, they in turn observed him. Listening to their exchange, it was clear they didn't even regard these students as human. And \"make it quick.\" Dragging a suitcase, are you here for a picnic?\n\nMost prodigies enjoy showing off, whether passively or actively. A life without showing off is meaningless. Like walking in brocade at night.* 749 doesn't suppress prodigies. The more powerful you perform, the happier 749 becomes, and the greater their cultivation efforts will be. But there's a red line: showing off isn't lawlessness. When one who shows off meets another who shows off even more, the outcome is predictable.\n\nGao Han stepped forward: \"You really know how to show off. You, the one dragging the suitcase, come on, let's go one-on-one. I'll see how you 'make it quick'.\"\n\nBai Hemian could barely suppress his smile. Words of helplessness and a hint of sarcasm spilled from his lips.\n\n\"How marvelous, he can even choose his opponent.\"\n\nLu Ding released the suitcase handle. As they were all colleagues, he naturally wouldn't cause fatalities or severe injuries. He pointed to the pile of fallen leaves accumulated in the corner. In the calmest tone, he uttered the most shocking words: \"I will remind you twice. The first time, three seconds from now, you will be lying there.\"\n\nEveryone was momentarily stunned. This display, it was simply fresh, unconventional, and distinctly unique.\n\nThen Lu Ding raised his second finger: \"The second time, I will tell you that when I make my move, you must block. Remember to protect your vitals.\"\n\nGao Han was about to say something more. Just then, Lu Ding called out: \"Block!\"\n\nThe figure in Gao Han's eyes vanished. In a flash, he felt his vision go black. Accompanied by a 'bang', he was sent 'whoosh' flying backward, plunging into the pile of fallen leaves. Kicking up a flurry of leaves into the sky, he lay down and didn't get up again, not even a whimper of pain escaped him. It seemed he had simply passed out.\n\nThe crowd looked at Gao Han in the pile of dry leaves; only one foot was exposed, the rest of his body completely buried. Lu Ding stood in his previous spot, turning his head to look.\n\nZhu Yixuan, standing nearby, instantly broke into a cold sweat. At this moment, Lu Ding displayed no aura whatsoever. He simply stood there, and an overwhelming sense of pressure washed over them.\n\nFast! Too fast! They hadn't even seen how Lu Ding made his move. They hadn't even blinked, yet their reactions and eyesight simply couldn't keep up with his movements. It was as if they had merely blinked, and Gao Han was already arcing through the air.\n\nYet even so, Zhu Yixuan still felt that if he didn't draw his blade, he would be betraying his own efforts. The blade sheath on his back stirred. A hand gripped it, and a 'click' was heard. Zhu Yixuan's heart was shaken, his eyes wide with terror! This person, with just his hand, had clamped his blade sheath shut. This... what terrifying physical strength this was.\n\n\"Too many limitations. You have to open a slit before drawing the blade. We're all modern people now, you should learn to enjoy how technology changes life. Next time, get one that can transform.\"\n\nLu Ding looked at the blade sheath; it was full of traces left by time. His tone shifted: \"So, you also want to dance in the air like him?\" Lu Ding pointed to the pile of fallen leaves on the other side: \"Then you'll have to lie down there, otherwise you'll hit him and injure him.\"\n\nZhu Yixuan followed his hand and looked at the pile of fallen leaves. A sense of oppression descended upon him, and he laughed awkwardly: \"Haha, there's really no need for that. The blades are too stuffy inside the sheath; I'll just open a slit to let them breathe.\"\n\nForget fighting, he couldn't even react. They weren't mortal enemies; they would be training together in the future. Admitting defeat wasn't shameful.\n\nAfter the awkwardness came silence. Loaned Blade Practitioners, who loan blades without taking a single coin, involve themselves with the theories of fate and destiny, leaving a prophecy; when the time comes, it is the day to reclaim the blade. Borrowing the \"smoke and fire\" of myriad households*, they nurture the unrestrained blades within their sheaths. The blade energy had endless wondrous uses, capable of severing anything. But now, Zhu Yixuan felt his own blade energy was as if it had encountered some natural enemy or a powerful elder. While not exactly trembling, it certainly dared not act rashly. Otherwise, if this person before him clamped the sheath with his hand, how could the blade energy inside not surge out from the gaps and cut him?\n\nOn this side, Zhu Yixuan was still steeped in confusion and the blow of his blade energy's reluctance to emerge, unable to extricate himself. Meanwhile, Lu Ding looked at the crowd:\n\nToday, he was here to champion Bai Hemian. Lu Ding didn't know what Bai Hemian had done, nor did he need to know what Bai Hemian had done. First, he hadn't broken any laws or rules. Second, he hadn't committed murder or arson. Otherwise, Bai Hemian couldn't possibly still be standing here. As for other rights and wrongs, today he was a student, not an enforcer. He couldn't disentangle all the intricacies.\n\nYou a group of people beat one person, then today he alone would beat all of you.\n\n\"Who all just ganged up on him!!?\"\n\n---\n*   **Like walking in brocade at night:** An idiom meaning to do something impressive without anyone noticing, thus feeling it's a wasted effort.\n*   **\"smoke and fire\" of myriad households:** A figurative term referring to the mundane, everyday life of people, often implying human vitality or collective energy.",

    "content": "Growing up in the orphanage, because he had no parents and an adult soul, he appeared reclusive. He couldn't play with other children.\n\nWhenever disputes arose with classmates at the academy, Lu Ding would think, if only someone in an adult's social capacity could step in, mediate for him, and help him out.\n\nBut there wasn't, not a single one. Others would only say he was unwanted. Even with an adult soul, hearing such words too often was unbearable.\n\nSince no one like that stood up for him when he was little, then when he grew up, he would become that person. No relatives, no family, but he had friends.\n\nAn oppressive aura diffused outwards, causing some of those present to feel a bit unsteady on their feet.\n\nRegarding taking the courtyards, they were first come, first served. When Bai Hemian asked if someone was there and retreated to look for a second one, it showed he acknowledged the principle of \"first come, first served.\"\n\nBut for the second and third ones, though clearly empty, you told him they were occupied.\n\nOccupying them yourself wasn't enough; you had to claim them for others too. You help your friends, I pursue my needs.\n\nAt this point, it's no longer a matter of reason or fairness. It holds no water; plainly put, it's a test of individual ability.\n\nIf one person couldn't win, and you called in a group, that's a skill. So Bai Hemian retreated and accepted it.\n\nIf Bai Hemian couldn't win alone, and he called in Lu Ding, that's also a skill. Now it's your turn to accept it.\n\nWhat do you have to be unconvinced about?\n\nBeating the small, then bringing in the big; defeating the weak, then bringing in the strong – this isn't exclusively a villain's privilege.\n\nThese people understood. So, after witnessing Lu Ding's fierce might, some dared not make a sound.\n\nIn this situation, anyone still daring to stick their neck out was purely a \"hard-headed fool\"* looking for a beating.\n\nSeeing their silence, Lu Ding called out to Bai Hemian: \"Come on, point them out. Whoever laid a hand on you just now, go right up and punch them.\"\n\nHe certainly wasn't one to \"repay grievances with kindness\"* or back down when he was in the right.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"If you repay grievances with kindness, how do you repay kindness?\" One should only \"repay grievances with fairness and kindness with kindness.\"\n\nIf you argue for three points even when in the wrong, why should you yield when you're in the right?\n\nBai Hemian didn't drag his feet and walked straight over.\n\nSeeing him approach, clearly intent on acting, someone among those who had previously ganged up on him spoke up.\n\n\"Wait a moment, wait a moment. We were indeed in the wrong just now. We shouldn't have ganged up on you, yes...\"\n\nJust as he said this, Lu Ding interrupted: \"You've already done the regrettable thing. There's no need to say 'sorry' again; I don't want to hear it.\"\n\nLu Ding had heard enough of such words when he was little; he already had a clear strategy for dealing with them.\n\nHaving been drenched in the rain, he knew that when you lowered your head, the rainwater would run along your eyelashes and into your eyes.\n\n*BANG!!*\n\nBai Hemian had been walking in a straight line, but upon hearing the man's words, he made a sharp turn, walked up to the man, and kicked him. The man literally flew into the air.\n\nSeeing him actually make a move, the young man who had first started the conflict with Bai Hemian felt a surge of fear.\n\n\"Brother, if we take a step back, the world is vast...\"*\n\n\"Then you retreat,\" Lu Ding said, choking him with a single sentence. \"I won't.\"\n\nHe took a step back, feeling a hollowness in his chest, and shouted loudly, \"Don't be scared! There are only two of them, let's all go at them together!!!\"\n\nThen, not a single person around him paid him any mind. Instead, some people voluntarily stepped forward. He had thought they were going to act, just like before.\n\nWho knew, they only stepped out to take their beating like a man, and to admit defeat if they couldn't win.\n\nThey had previously ganged up on others, and when those others couldn't win, they retreated. Now, those others had called in someone formidable to hit back, which was perfectly normal. They could understand it; they were all hot-blooded young men, and there was no hurdle they couldn't overcome.\n\n\"I hit you, you took it. So you hit me, and I'll take it too, alright? No one's more noble than anyone else.\"\n\nSuch was the world of the Qi Refiners.\n\nBesides, with Lu Ding's move just now, anyone who wasn't blind could see that they weren't even in the same league.\n\nGo at him together? Are you crazy? Go up together just to get thrashed?\n\nAnd then, Bai Hemian bypassed these self-identified targets and walked directly to the person who had been speaking.\n\n\"Right at the beginning, you said 'someone's here, someone's there.' Look, is anyone still here now?\"\n\nPeng Hui twisted his head left and right; there was no one beside him. Only he remained, alone, facing Bai Hemian.\n\nHe then looked at the pile of fallen leaves nearby, where even the genius from his own district, who was stronger than him, was lying unconscious. He...\n\n\"Now it's just you. Go on, I'll give you a chance.\"\n\nHe squeezed out a face uglier than crying: \"Bro, I was wrong. Please, pick any courtyard you like. Just... can you not hit my face?\"\n\nBai Hemian nodded. The man forced a relaxed smile, \"You're actually pretty nice.\"\n\nWith that, he was sent flying directly into the pile of fallen leaves, landing right on the unconscious Gao Han and waking him up.\n\nGao Han suddenly opened his eyes. This time, he was smarter and didn't say a word.\n\nHe did a carp sit-up to get up, twisted his *Qi* into incense, held it high above his head, chanted spells, performed hand seals, and bobbed his head.\n\nHe was about to offer incense and summon a deity.\n\nThe next moment, Lu Ding flashed over again. *BANG!!!!*\n\n\"Your wind-up is too long. If you're not convinced, then sleep a little longer.\"\n\nGao Han, who had only been awake for a few seconds, fell back asleep. Youth was truly great; he could just lie down and sleep.\n\nBai Hemian, having held back his strength, sent the man flying, then turned to drag over his suitcase.\n\nLu Ding took it. The two of them were about to go in and choose their respective courtyards.\n\nBefore the two of them had even walked a few steps, Zhu Yixuan, the Blade Debt Inheritor,* who had been silently taking hits, spoke up and called for them to stop.\n\n\"I implore you, could you please help me test a blade? My 'Boxed Blade Qi' cuts through anything, but today it seems something's gone wrong.\"\n\nHe felt that his Blade Qi might have a problem. He himself couldn't possibly have a problem, nor could his family heirloom.\n\nSo the problem could only be with the person standing before him. He wondered, could it be that he, too, was a bladesman?\n\nBut he didn't see Lu Ding with a blade, nor did he possess the aura of a bladesman.\n\nCould it be the legendary \"Blade Concealment Art,\" where the weapon is hidden within one's body, unseen by outsiders, and only drawn to draw blood? Or something like a Sumeru Mustard Seed?*\n\nRegardless, he wanted to see it for himself.\n\nAs a Blade Debt Inheritor from a single-lineage transmission, cultivating the \"Boxed Blade Qi\" that cuts through anything – these were the words passed down by his father, his grandfather, and even his ancestors.\n\nBefore this, he had always held an unwavering belief in that statement. He had even secured this year's advanced study spot precisely because of the Blade Qi described in those words.\n\nBut now, his \"cuts through anything\" Blade Qi was afraid to emerge, like a turtle retreating into its shell.\n\nHe found it a bit unacceptable. But he wasn't challenging; he already knew their capabilities* from earlier. This was a request for guidance, a sincere plea!!\n\nLu Ding turned around. \"Cuts through anything?\"\n\n\"That's right, what about it?\" Zhu Yixuan nodded.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding showed no major expression, Zhu Yixuan couldn't shake the feeling that his words sounded a little odd.\n\n\"Alright, I'll humor you with a test.\"\n\nZhu Yixuan's tone and attitude alone were enough to satisfy Lu Ding. And his \"cuts through anything\" Blade Qi was enough to pique Lu Ding's interest.\n\nThe Way of the Weighty Chariot also cuts through anything and has helped him deal with many powerful enemies. Now, another \"cuts through anything\" has appeared.\n\nIt's like the Silver Horn King and Sun Wukong both pulling out a Gourd of Purple Gold and Crimson at the same time.\n\nReal or fake, male or female – you just have to test it.\n___\n**Footnotes:**\n*   \"hard-headed fool\" (鐵頭娃, *tiětóuwá*): Literally \"iron-headed baby,\" a slang term for someone reckless, stubborn, or stubbornly asking for trouble.\n*   \"repay grievances with kindness\" (以德報怨, *yǐ dé bào yuàn*): An idiom from classical Chinese philosophy, often attributed to Confucius.

    "title": "Chapter 118: The Ding, are you short of weapons?",
    "content": "......\n\nZhu Yixuan released the blade case, and a yellow light flew out from it, converging in his hand to form a long, slender curved blade with an amber-colored body and a jet-black hilt.\n\nTiger stripes coiled around it, with a tiger's tail forming the hilt.\n\nZhu Yixuan flipped his hand, using the blade's surface to face the person. The cold light shimmered, radiating sinister energy.\n\n“This blade is named Hupo. It weighs thirteen *jin*¹, and its raw materials were the refined bones of a malevolent tiger that caused havoc in the past. It was forged with special ore and secret methods, then placed in a killing intent nurturing ground for a hundred years before being given to a general for ten years. It passed through several generations before reaching my hands.”\n\n“You, draw your blade.”\n\nBlade?\n\nLu Ding shook his head: “I don’t use a blade. Just come at me directly.”\n\nZhu Yixuan didn't say anything else.\n\nHe exerted force through his arm, driving his wrist, and slashed upwards. The rampant blade energy, carrying sinister energy, appeared like a vicious tiger pouncing.\n\nLu Ding casually flung out a slash and turned to leave.\n\nHe had, in the end...... still held overly high expectations.\n\nThe moment the blade was drawn, Lu Ding understood that this person's so-called 'nothing is un-slashable'² and his Way of Jin Che³ had too vast a gap.\n\nThey were not in the same league at all; there was a world of difference between them.\n\nThe vicious tiger was vertically cut in half and dissipated into the air.\n\nSeeing the slash approach with its power undiminished in the slightest, a flash of horror appeared in Zhu Yixuan's eyes.\n\nIt was as if death was beckoning him.\n\nThe next moment, the slash transformed into a gentle breeze caressing his face, stirring his hair.\n\nCold sweat dripped from the tip of his nose, stirring up dust on the ground.\n\nZhu Yixuan looked at the Hupo in his hand, and thoughts welled up in his mind.\n\nGrandpa, you lied to me. Dad...... you lied to me too.\n\nWhat 'nothing is un-slashable'......\n\nMe!!!!\n\nHe raised the curved blade in his hand, but once raised, he couldn't bring himself to throw it away.\n\nAfter thinking about it, he still couldn't part with it.\n\nSuddenly, his eyes lit up. They were all geniuses; how could their minds be slow?\n\nHe watched Lu Ding's receding figure and muttered to himself: “Did he just say he doesn’t use a blade?”\n\n“How can he not use a blade? How can he possibly not use a blade!!!”\n\n“With such slashes, wouldn't not using a blade be a waste!!!”\n\nCarrying the blade case on his back, Zhu Yixuan quickly chased after him.\n\n“Hey, hey, brother, wait up!!”\n\nHe caught up to Lu Ding and, with a slightly fawning smile, asked: “Hehehe, excuse me, may I ask your esteemed surname?”\n\nEveryone else was stunned.\n\nHey!\n\nAren't you a genius? Where's your arrogance!!?\n\nIn response, Zhu Yixuan said, \"Arrogance? I'm asking for something from him now, what do I need arrogance for?\"\n\n“No need to be polite. My surname is Lu, and my given name is Ding.”\n\n“No wonder, I should have thought of it earlier, I should have thought of it earlier.”\n\nAs Zhu Yixuan spoke, he put down the blade case on his back, and the smile never left his face.\n\n“Um...... Lu Ding, I mean, do you...... need any weapons? For example, blades. Like a Miao Dao⁴, a Heng Dao⁵, a Dahuan Dao⁶, a Zhanmadao⁷. As long as it's a blade, I have everything here.”\n\n“Look...... do you want one?”\n\nAt this, he quickly sped up his tone: “It's free, I don't want anything. I'll loan it to you, for as long as you want.”\n\nLu Ding pondered.\n\nWeapons were not a necessity for him.\n\nMainly, his strength grew too quickly; before he knew it, a once handy weapon would become unsuitable.\n\nHe'd have to replace it again.\n\nAnd then, would he really keep borrowing from this person?\n\nBesides, what's borrowed isn't his own. He wasn't going to nurture another's blade.\n\nAs for claiming it as his own and refusing to return it.\n\nSorry, Lu Ding couldn't do that either.\n\nAlso, Lu Ding simply didn't think much of the quality of his blade.\n\nIf he absolutely had to get a weapon, he would certainly forge one using Nanshan Wanshi, but for now, he only had the main material for that.\n\nLu Ding didn't have the other supplementary materials yet.\n\nIt wasn't worth spending contribution points to buy them. It was better to improve his strength and take things one step at a time.\n\nIf he had the opportunity, he'd forge it; if not, then so be it.\n\nAnyway, even without a blade, he could still slash with a raised hand.\n\nHe refused: “No need. I don’t like nurturing another’s blade.”\n\nHearing this, Zhu Yixuan grew anxious: “Then I’ll just give it to you! I won't loan it! I'll give it to you for free, truly for free! Don’t leave!”\n\nThe onlookers around them, witnessing this scene, nearly had their eyeballs pop out.\n\nThose unaware of the situation were fine.\n\nBut those who knew Zhu Yixuan's background, their eyes all turned red.\n\nThe 'Blade Loanee's'⁸ blade, given away for free!?\n\nAnd he was practically falling over himself, begging and pleading to give it away—hey, and the other person didn't want it.\n\nSomething others wouldn't even dare to dream of, he simply refused.\n\nCan you believe this!?\n\nComparing people really pisses people off. Forget giving it away, Zhu Yixuan wouldn't even loan them a blade.\n\nNow, he was giving it away for free, and others didn't want it. For some reason, everyone else felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching him.\n\nHehehe.... Before, we begged you to loan us a blade, and you wouldn't. Now you're giving them away for free, and others don't want them. Do you understand our feelings now?\n\nSatisfying!!!\n\n“Did he just say his name was Lu Ding?”\n\nSomeone belatedly realized.\n\n“I heard it too. He said his surname was Lu, and his given name was Ding.”\n\n“Didn't they say Lu Ding liked to wear Wénwǔ Xiù⁹? Why isn't he wearing them today? Oh dear!!! I always thought the one wearing Wénwǔ Xiù was Lu Ding, but he's not wearing them today!!”\n\n“He doesn't only have one outfit, does he? He has to wash it, right?”\n\n“I'm so annoyed! Wénwǔ Xiù, Wénwǔ Xiù, I had a preconceived notion!!!”\n\n“This counts as us witnessing his prowess firsthand, without any preconceived notions. Indeed, there are no undeserved reputations under a great name.”\n\n“Isn't this called 'a fight makes friends'?”\n\n“If he's Lu Ding, then the one next to him, dressed all in black, isn't that Bai Hemian?”\n\n“Good heavens, we surrounded and attacked Bai Hemian, and we were evenly matched, hahahahaha! I'm going back to brag about this!”\n\n“But seriously, Bai Hemian alone managed to hold off so many people without falling behind. These two 'guaranteed admissions' truly have no hidden weaknesses. I'm impressed, truly impressed.”\n\nAs the crowd spoke, some quietly glanced at Gao Han and the other person lying in the pile of fallen leaves.\n\nMuttering silently in their hearts.\n\nWe really have you to thank for helping us lure them out.\n\nOtherwise, with Lu Ding's exaggerated strength, whoever went up against him would be out of luck.\n\nGetting beaten up in front of so many people, how embarrassing that would be! Thankfully, I wasn't the first to go.\n\nNot far away, atop a tree, two figures stood with their arms crossed.\n\nIf Lu Ding and Bai Hemian were this year's biggest 'guaranteed admission' dark horses.\n\nThen these two were the strongest geniuses apart from Lu Ding and Bai Hemian.\n\nOne was Huangpu Lingyun, a genius from the Eastern Great Region who awakened his abilities with the Jing Dynasty Imperial Seal. Adorned in brocade robes, he exuded magnificence.\n\nHis gaze always remained composed.\n\nThe other was Nuomin, a young woman from the Northwestern Great Region blessed by the Eternal Heaven. Dressed in tight-fitting attire for agility and convenience, her long hair flowed freely.\n\nShe carried with her the wild spirit of the prairie people.\n\nThe two met outside the training grounds, and after exchanging a few moves, both felt that the other's strength was no less than their own.\n\nConsidering themselves kindred spirits, they felt like cranes among chickens, far surpassing the other students.\n\nThey mutually viewed each other as their greatest rival in this academy session.\n\nAs for Lu Ding and Bai Hemian, being 'guaranteed admissions' and not having fought them yet, they didn't hold a very prominent place in their minds.\n\nBut they didn't underestimate them either, for after all, a great reputation is never undeserved.\n\n“What do you think?”\n\n---\n¹ **jin**: A traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kilograms (or 1.1 pounds).\n² **nothing is un-slashable**: A direct translation of a Chinese idiom (無物不斬, *wúwù bù zhǎn*), referring to a blade or technique that can cut through anything.\n³ **Way of Jin Che**: A specific martial art or combat philosophy.\n⁴ **Miao Dao**: A long, two-handed Chinese saber, often associated with southern Chinese martial arts.\n⁵ **Heng Dao**: A straight, single-edged Chinese sword, primarily used during the Tang dynasty.\n⁶ **Dahuan Dao**: A type of Chinese saber, literally \"Big Ring Saber,\" distinguished by a large ring on the pommel.\n⁷ **Zhanmadao**: A long, single-edged anti-cavalry sword, literally \"horse-chopping saber.\"\n⁸ **Blade Loanee**: A direct translation of 賒刀人 (*shē dāo rén*), referring to someone who loans out blades (often with specific conditions or predictions attached).\n⁹ **Wénwǔ Xiù**: A specific style of clothing or sleeves, literally meaning \"Civil and Military Sleeves,\" suggesting a blend of scholarly and martial attire.",

    "content": "Huangfu Lingyun's tone was calm: \"My physical body is still acceptable; as for the rest, we'll see.\"\n\nNuomin nodded in agreement, impressed: \"His physical body is truly terrifying. In that regard, I'm not as good as him.\"\n\nShe believed her physical body was already formidable.\n\nBut if it were her, Zhu Yixuan, and Gao Han facing off today, relying solely on physical bodies, she definitely couldn't beat those two.\n\nDon't look at Gao Han: he couldn't last two moves under Lu Ding, yet he treats others like soft persimmons.\n\nHe's still one of the top three in his district, after all.\n\nHearing her words, Huangfu Lingyun chuckled: \"Haha, how can you boost others' morale and deflate your own prestige?\"\n\nThe reason for his laughter was simple.\n\nIn the way of the physical body, Nuomin had already admitted she was inferior to Lu Ding.\n\nBut Huangfu Lingyun didn't think so: \"Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Why use one's weakness to challenge their strength?\"\n\n\"If I were to face him one-on-one, and he didn't use that charged slash, he would definitely lose.\"\n\n\"His whole set of skills relies mostly on slashes. As for defense, I have Dragon Qi Protection and Jade Seal Protection.\"\n\n\"As for offense, I have the Jinghuang Treasure Sword, which can parry his slashes.\"\n\nAlthough Huangfu Lingyun hadn't finished speaking.\n\nBut hearing this, Nuomin cast a surprised glance: \"You got the Jinghuang Treasure Sword!?\"\n\nThe topic shifted.\n\nHuangfu Lingyun nodded, with utmost nonchalance.\n\n\"This is my training award.\"\n\nNuomin looked at him. Huangfu Lingyun was already strong, and now with the Jinghuang Treasure Sword, it was truly like adding wings to a tiger.\n\nEspecially when used in conjunction with the Jing Dynasty Jade Seal.\n\nIf he really were to face Lu Ding one-on-one then......\n\nIt's hard to say.\n\nNuomin thought this to herself because she didn't know what training award Lu Ding had received.\n\nSo, she couldn't conclude that Lu Ding would definitely lose.\n\nEvening arrived.\n\nAt the Suiyi Courtyard in the training grounds.\n\nWen Ruchu's scolding voice rang out.\n\n\"Stop fucking laughing! If you laugh anymore and your wounds burst open, you can apply your own medicine!!\"\n\nXue Ning laughed while spitting blood, simply because he heard that Lu Ding had made the early-arriving geniuses from other districts stand in a line outside for Bai Hemian to whip.\n\nThe wounds on his body, barely bandaged, burst open inch by inch with his laughter: \"Hahahahaha, hiss, hahahahaha, hiss.....\"\n\n\"Provoke Lu Ding? Hahahahack-ack-ack-ack-retch~\"\n\n\"If you weren't all wearing the identity of a 749 Investigator, every single one of you would have been so crippled you couldn't even lift a finger.<sup>1</sup>\"\n\n\"A person's name, a tree's shadow – the Corpse-Disassembling Tai Sui isn't called that for nothing.\"\n\nWen Ruchu sighed beside him: \"That's enough, if you keep laughing, all your wounds will burst open, and then I'll have to re-bandage you again.\"\n\n\"You might not be tired, but I'm truly exhausted.\"\n\nThe two met at the doorway; they were both from the same area. Seeing his severe injuries, Wen Ruchu decided to help him.\n\nBut as soon as he had casually bandaged Xue Ning, the latter immediately burst his wounds open again with laughter.\n\nHe was truly annoyed; let the world burn.\n\nIt was then that a knock sounded from outside.\n\nWen Ruchu called out, \"Come in.\"\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian pushed open the door and walked in. Bai Hemian was still holding medicine.\n\n\"Here, apply this. Last a bit longer; don't die so fast.\"\n\nHe had just inadvertently seen Xue Ning and Wen Ruchu, remembering that Xue Ning had cheered on Lu Ding when he fought Cao Zi'ang earlier.\n\nNow that he was so severely injured, should they come and take a look?\n\nBut Bai Hemian felt it was a bit strange, so he called Lu Ding along.\n\nSeeing it was the two of them.\n\nXue Ning, lying on the bed, waved his hand.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing. These injuries only look severe; I won't die. Most people are here now, so according to the training ground procedures from previous years...\"\n\n\"Once everyone's assembled, we'll enter the Blood Pool.\"\n\n\"Those of us who received training awards will sit deeper inside. Once in the Blood Pool, with one absorption and one wash, we'll be as lively as new, full of vigor.\"\n\n\"Then comes the learning: Dragon-Slaying Expeditions, returning to the Dragon-Rolling Wall, and the East Asian Genius Monster Room Grand Melee, where dog brains will be beaten out, plasma spilled everywhere, and heads rolling all over the ground. Just the same old routine, I guess.\"\n\nWen Ruchu helped Xue Ning, who was struggling to sit up.\n\n\"It's a bit old, and there haven't been any reforms, but it works well, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"The Blood Pool uses Tai Sui blood combined with essences of various rare natural treasures, to strengthen foundations, and increase basic combat power and cultivation realm.\"\n\n\"The expeditions involve gathering feng shui energy, killing accompanying demons and monsters, and fighting tough battles to gain combat experience. We are all hothouse flowers, so this is essential.\"\n\n\"The Dragon-Rolling Wall increases our knowledge and understanding of more things. Finally, the Southeast Asian Monster Room is to show off the muscle of our new generation and to put pressure on Qi Cultivators from other countries.\"\n\n\"It's similar to the Imperial Examinations. Before, it was called Imperial Examinations; now it's called Gaokao. It's been around for so many years; why change something that works?\"\n\nXue Ning, who was beside him, wanted to add something to Wen Ruchu's words, but suddenly, he turned his head and looked towards the doorway.\n\n\"Hey! That kid at the door, what are you doing with those shifty eyes?\"\n\nEveryone looked over at the sound. It was Zhu Yixuan, who had quietly followed Lu Ding in.\n\nDiscovered, he looked a bit awkward, gazing up at the sky, then down at the ground.\n\nFinally, he pointed at Lu Ding: \"I..... hahaha....\"\n\nLu Ding was helpless. Why was someone still so eager to offer him a knife?\n\n\"I really don't want your knives. To be clearer, the quality of your knives is too poor.\"\n\n\"Huh?!!! Impossible, absolutely impossible! The quality of my knives is definitely good enough!!\"\n\nTell him he's bad, Zhu Yixuan might be able to tolerate it, but if you say the quality of his knives is poor...\n\nHe couldn't tolerate it in a million years.\n\nJust moments ago, he was at the doorway; he immediately unstrapped the blade case from his back and quickly walked forward.\n\n\"You try it, you really must try it! I beg you to try! Really, try it first before you say anything! It's definitely not bad, honest dealing for young and old.\"\n\nSeeing him insist on him trying it.\n\nLu Ding nodded: \"Alright, pick one you won't feel bad about if it breaks, and give it to me.\"\n\nAlthough he didn't understand what he meant by that.\n\nBut Zhu Yixuan still complied, choosing a not-so-great knife and handing it to Lu Ding.\n\nAlthough a knife is a knife-wielder's life.\n\nBut a loan-knife vendor's main characteristic is having many knives, and his primary-use knives weren't among them.\n\nLu Ding took the Goose Feather Blade he offered.\n\n\"Do you think I'm suitable for using a knife because I can unleash slashes?\"\n\nZhu Yixuan nodded.\n\nLu Ding continued: \"Then let me ask you, what if this knife can't withstand my slashes?\"\n\n\"No.....\"\n\nBang!!!\n\nBefore Zhu Yixuan could finish speaking, the Goose Feather Blade in Lu Ding's hand suddenly exploded, sending fragments flying and deeply embedding themselves in the ground.\n\nHe handed the remaining hilt to Zhu Yixuan.\n\nLu Ding spread his hands, his expression helpless.\n\nSilence spoke volumes here.\n\nZhu Yixuan sat on the stool.\n\nThoughts churned in his mind.\n\nHe hadn't even used full strength, and the knife couldn't withstand it. If it truly came to fighting demons and monsters...\n\nThen this knife, he feared, would not only fail to be a helpful tool but would become a hindrance...\n\nSeeing him somewhat crestfallen.\n\nA smile appeared on Xue Ning's face. This feeling, it was great!!!\n\n\"Don't lose heart. If it really won't work out, why don't you give one to me?\"\n\nZhu Yixuan: ?????\n\nHe slowly raised his head, scrutinizing Xue Ning.\n\nOne word popped out of his mouth: \"You?\"\n\n\"Hey!! What do you mean by that, what do you mean by that!!?\"\n***\n<sup>1</sup> Lit. \"couldn't even pick themselves up,\" implying they would be utterly incapacitated.",

I want to see who's showing off in front of Brother Lu, who, let me see, let me see.\"\n\nWhen he clearly saw who had flown past, Xue Ning instantly stopped laughing. His emotions flared, and his wound burst open again, spraying blood:\n\n\"Hiss~ Brother Lu, I know this guy, Huangfu Lingyun from the Eastern Region. He's a real weirdo. He got lucky and found the Jing Dynasty Imperial Seal somewhere. That guy, I tell you, he's just unbelievable!!\"\n\n\"What damn era is this already? He still thinks he can be an emperor.\"\n\nLu Ding did not speak.\n\nBai Hemian glanced at him, \"Hmm! Huangfu Lingyun is about to get beaten.\"\n\nYan Feifan had told him exactly that.\n\n'Brother Lu tolerates threats the least, hates others using him to show off the most, followed by those who can show off more than him, and finally, those who show off in front of him.'\n\nAs the group walked forward, they heard Xue Ning muttering beside them.\n\nOne moment he was talking to Bai Hemian beside him, the next to Wen Ruchu.\n\n\"Let me tell you, I'm from a family of inherited Qi Cultivators, right? My second uncle's family is too, they're from my lineage. His eldest son, my cousin, is also an investigator at 749.\"\n\n\"That guy, he's incredibly arrogant. When he goes home, he acts like he's on top of the world.\"\n\n\"I was influenced by him, that's why I came to Yunhai to be an investigator.\"\n\n\"My parents said this was an iron rice bowl. In the old days, they'd say, 'Swallows that once graced the halls of the Wang and Xie families now fly into the homes of common people.'\"¹\n\n\"Then, before, I saw that kid on official business—an intern investigator. My cousin, a formal investigator, was following right behind Huangfu Lingyun, which pissed me off so much.\"\n\n\"Overlord Spear, is that how you use an Overlord Spear!!?\"\n\nHis voice rose several octaves as he said this.\n\n\"He's turned the Overlord Spear into a lackey's spear! He even told me he was investing early, saying this Huangfu Lingyun was a Child of Destiny, with the Mandate of Heaven.\"\n\n\"In the past, he would have been an emperor.\"\n\n\"He's full of crap!\"\n\n\"Later, I went and checked. What Huangfu Lingyun? Damn, he used to be called Zhang Wei. After he picked up that imperial seal, he changed his name to Huangfu Lingyun. Always showing off......\"\n\nHearing this, everyone subconsciously bared their front teeth.\n\nThey laughed.\n\nZhang Wei.\n\nIt's not that the name is bad.\n\nIt's a very common name.\n\nJust like Lu Ding, it's very normal, just an ordinary person.\n\nIf you hadn't changed it, no one would think anything of it. But if you go and change your name, how is that any different from burying your ears while stealing a bell?²\n\nIsn't that just handing out topics for others to talk about?\n\nSoon, the group followed and arrived outside the cave where the Blood Pool was located.\n\nAfter verifying their identities, they queued up and walked inside. It looked like a giant swimming pool.\n\nThere were many outlets below for water exchange.\n\nAlong the edge of the Blood Pool, there were also many large pipes with shut-off valves.\n\nAlthough it didn't look very appealing.\n\nHowever, as soon as they arrived, the smell in the air wafted over, and with one sniff, the spiritual qi within their bodies began to circulate through their meridians on its own.\n\nNo need to even try it; it was top-grade stuff, absolutely amazing!\n\nSeeing Lu Ding's figure appear at the entrance, looking this way.\n\nNuomin, standing beside Huangfu Lingyun, said, \"Were you provoking him just now?\"\n\n\"Provoking him? No, no, no, I was just saying hello to him.\"\n\nProvoking?\n\nHow could that be?\n\nIn his perception, he possessed the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nPicking up an imperial seal and gaining enlightenment, who wouldn't feel they had the Mandate of Heaven?\n\nBefore he picked it up, it was just a broken stone. After picking it up, it became 'I am the Mandate of Heaven, I am where the Mandate of Heaven belongs.'\n\nAnd it wasn't just anyone who could gain enlightenment from an imperial seal, nor could just any random imperial seal help someone gain enlightenment.\n\nThe right time, the right place, and the right people—none could be lacking.\n\nSo, if he wasn't destiny, who was?\n\nNow Huangfu Lingyun also had the Jing Emperor's Precious Sword.\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding, in his eyes, was a heaven-sent general, a candidate for a general who would charge into battle for him.\n\nJust like Xue Ning's cousin, Xue Yong.\n\nAs long as Huangfu Lingyun displayed his so-called charm, Lu Ding would also prostrate himself before him, just like Xue Yong.\n\nThere are many smart people in the world.\n\nThere are also many who know how to assess the situation.\n\nThat's why he developed such a mindset.\n\nPlus, he had some fantasies in his heart; after all, which boy wouldn't fantasize about expanding territory, becoming an immortal, or founding a lineage?\n\nHowever.\n\nMost people can distinguish reality; they dream, fantasize a bit, find some joy—the simplest way to be happy, everyone has it. Men are boys until they die.\n\nIt's like reading a novel: you enjoy it, and then it's over; no one carries it into reality.\n\nBut Huangfu Lingyun was different; he had been so consistently fortunate that his mind had been swept away.\n\nEspecially after a favored daughter of Heaven like Nuomin, blessed by the Eternal Sky, was apparently captivated by his charm.\n\nHe became even more swollen with pride.\n\nOr perhaps captivated; at least, that's what he thought.\n\n\"Greeting him like that is a bit inappropriate.\"\n\nNuomin finished speaking and stepped back a bit, because she saw Lu Ding and Bai Hemian were already walking quickly towards them.\n\nHuangfu Lingyun ignored her retreat.\n\nHe calmly watched Lu Ding approach, responding to her words.\n\n\"Inappropriate? So what if it's inappropriate? The result is nothing more than conflict, battle?\"\n\n\"This is the necessary path for a king to subdue his mount; only a spirited horse can ignite my desire for conquest!!\"\n\nOriginally, he wouldn't do something like this.\n\nBut!!!\n\nWhen he saw Xu Yixuan, defeated by Lu Ding, chasing after Lu Ding to give him a knife.\n\nHe felt a bit uncomfortable.\n\nBefore, he could still maintain his pretense, but seeing this scene, he truly couldn't anymore.\n\nUsually, such treatment was reserved for him.\n\nBut today, such a thing actually happened to someone else.\n\nHuangfu Lingyun found it somewhat intolerable.\n\nMoreover, this person was a famous genius of this year's Southeast Region.\n\nHe was completely on a different level from the people who used to flock around him.\n\nFurthermore, Bai Hemian was also with Lu Ding.\n\nIn such a comparison, Huangfu Lingyun found little sense of his own presence.\n\nThat's why he flew over Lu Ding's head.\n\nAnd left the words, \"I'm waiting for you at the Blood Pool.\"\n\nIt was all to find some sense of presence.\n\nNow that Lu Ding was approaching, Huangfu Lingyun's expression remained unchanged, still calm and collected.\n\nUntil Lu Ding, from several meters away, shouted those two words.\n\n\"Zhang Wei!!\"\n\nHuangfu Lingyun's face instantly darkened.\n\n\"You are looking for death!!!!\"\n\nHis so-called composure could no longer be maintained. Huangfu Lingyun instantly flared up, his eyes glowing, and golden talismans spiraled and danced around his fists.\n\nLu Ding reached into the void, pulling out a life-sized, ancient stone tablet from it.\n\nOn it, three large characters were written in bold, flowing strokes: Shi Gandang!!!³\n\n---\n¹**舊時王謝堂前燕，飛入尋常百姓家 (Jiù shí Wáng Xiè táng qián yàn, fēi rù xúncháng bǎixìng jiā):** A line from Liu Yuxi's Tang dynasty poem \"Wuyi Lane,\" lamenting the decline of aristocratic families. It literally means \"Swallows that once graced the halls of the Wang and Xie families of old, now fly into the homes of common people,\" implying that something once exclusive to the elite has become common or ordinary.\n²**掩耳盜鈴 (yǎn'ěr dàolíng):** An idiom meaning \"burying one's ears while stealing a bell.\" It refers to deceiving oneself or attempting to hide something obvious, believing that if you don't perceive the problem, it doesn't exist.\n³**石敢當 (Shí Gǎndāng):** A stone tablet inscribed with these three characters, traditionally placed in front of houses, at crossroads, or other locations in Chinese folklore to ward off evil spirits, bad luck, and negative influences.",

    "content": "Compared to Huángfǔ Língyún, who was enveloped in flowing divine radiance, Lù Dǐng was utterly unadorned.\n\nEven the stone tablet in his hand was just as plain.\n\nOnly the vigorous strokes of the three characters \"Shígǎndāng\" hinted at its miraculous power, offering a glimpse through a tube¹.\n\nThis was also inspiration from Huángfǔ Língyún. Since he could use his imperial seal to defend himself, why couldn't Lù Dǐng use a stone tablet as a weapon? Practice yields true knowledge.\n\nHe swung the stone tablet, striking out.\n\nBOOM!!!!!\n\nIt carried a terrifying suppressive force, subduing the power emanating from Huángfǔ Língyún. Fist met stone tablet.\n\nThen came a crunch...\n\nHuángfǔ Língyún was instantly slapped, sent flying.\n\nHe had no power to resist whatsoever. It was like swatting a fly with a fly swatter.\n\nHe couldn't believe in his heart that this ancient, simple stone tablet could possess such terrifying power. It took his direct punch without being scathed, and the strange suppressive force within it instantly rendered his techniques useless.\n\nIt was only at this moment that he understood: Lù Dǐng's \"gold content\" in being able to break through Shígǎndāng's defenses was still rising.\n\nAs Huángfǔ Língyún flew through the air, Lù Dǐng moved swiftly to press the attack. Still in the air, he held the tablet with both hands, raising it high above his head: \"I'll let you show off!!!\"\n\nBANG!!!!\n\nThe stone tablet smashed down again, carrying Lù Dǐng's own terrifying strength. Huángfǔ Língyún was slammed down from the air, crashing hard onto the ground. He felt pain in every bone and muscle.\n\nLù Dǐng landed, stomped his foot, and raised the stone tablet a third time.\n\nBANG!!!\n\n\"Show off!\"\n\nA fourth raise, BANG!\n\n\"Show off again!!\"\n\nA fifth raise.\n\n\"Show off one more time for me to see!!\"\n\nThe stone tablet crashed down repeatedly. Huángfǔ Língyún tried to speak or get up each time, but whenever there was the slightest sign, Lù Dǐng would mercilessly suppress him with the raised tablet, slamming him down. He was beaten without any chance to fight back.\n\nThose around watched, wincing and gnashing their teeth. They sighed inwardly, marveling, \"This Lù Dǐng... truly ferocious. Huángfǔ Língyún, oh Huángfǔ Língyún, of all people to provoke, you chose him? Didn't you see that Shígǎndāng of the Sìmìng Realm provoked him before, and now it's become the stone tablet in his hand? How could you dare?\"\n\nHuángfǔ Língyún: \"I didn't know! Nobody said he'd smash people with a stone tablet! I'm the first!!!!\"\n\nAmong the Eastern geniuses who came with him, someone shouted:\n\n\"Stop hitting him! You're going to fucking kill him! We're all from the same region, Lù Dǐng, if you don't stop, don't blame us for ganging up on you!!\"\n\nHearing this, Lù Dǐng paused his movements. He swept his hand across the crowd, pointing: \"Come!!\"\n\n\"Come on, try to gang up on me! I'll fucking see who dares move today!!\"\n\nGiving them face, were they? Ganging up?\n\nLù Dǐng looked at where the Eastern Region geniuses were standing. \"Who was talking just now? Who said they wanted to gang up on me!?\"\n\nAs the saying goes, the bird that sticks its head out gets shot. Although Lù Dǐng wasn't afraid of being ganged up on, at a time like this, it was no different from a one-versus-many situation, with only the Easterners not having made their move yet. Anyone who's been in a fight knows that in a one-versus-many scenario, unless you have some skill, you simply can't win. Nobody exchanges single punches and kicks. It's fists and feet flying like rain. At such a time, you have to grab the one who's shouting the loudest, focus on them, beat them to death, hold them close and fight. Soon, no one will be hitting you.\n\nBái Hèmián, it seemed, had inherited Yàn Fēifán's King Yama's Roll Call². He raised his hand and pointed into the crowd: \"Him!\"\n\nLù Dǐng had just picked up the stone tablet, ready to charge.\n\nA coach beside them stepped forward and said, \"Alright, prepare to enter the Blood Pool.\"\n\nLù Dǐng smiled. He put away the stone tablet. \"Coach, I remember the rules of our academy state that one who is provoked can retaliate indefinitely. Are you not planning to abide by the rules?\"\n\nSòng Chūnfēng stiffened where he stood. This was indeed a rule, but for a student to rebut a coach... it wasn't unheard of, but the outcomes were usually very grim. Because the coaches here were at least of the Sìmìng Realm, responsible for both imparting knowledge and ensuring student safety. And Sòng Chūnfēng was a second-tier Sìmìng Realm Qi Cultivator.\n\nAs for why he stepped out, it was mainly because he was one of the coaches responsible for escorting the Eastern Region. Huángfǔ Língyún was someone he had recruited, just as Lǚ Tíng had recruited Lù Dǐng and his group. This was someone he thought highly of. But he usually didn't get along well with Lǚ Tíng's faction, and now, someone he thought highly of had been beaten by someone Lǚ Tíng thought highly of. His face had fallen to the ground, and he needed to pick it up.\n\nBut just as he was about to make a move, Lù Dǐng put his foot down. Sòng Chūnfēng's expression turned somewhat displeased. He was brewing the thought, \"Are you questioning a coach?\"\n\nBefore he could speak, Lù Dǐng preempted him with a smile: \"No problem, Coach, you're the coach, so whatever you say goes.\"\n\n*When I freeload my way into the Divine Palace later, then whatever I say goes.* This thought floated in his mind.\n\nThese words sounded pleasant on the surface, and Lù Dǐng's face showed no other unusual expression. Sòng Chūnfēng nodded, quite satisfied. Talented, and smart too, able to assess the situation and judge the circumstances—not bad. Since that's the case, then I, a great person, won't remember the faults of a small person³, I'll let you off the hook. He nodded, maintaining a stern expression, and said, \"Mm... go ahead.\"\n\nBái Hèmián shot him a bewildered look. Just a moment ago, he had been ready to take on the coach; as soon as Lù Dǐng moved, he was going to unleash Overlapping Netherworld Domain: Corpse Ridge Mountain on the coach. But Lù Dǐng's attitude had instantly changed. He was somewhat confused.\n\nUntil his eyes met Lù Dǐng's. Seeing Lù Dǐng blink, Bái Hèmián instantly understood! He secretly made up his mind that he would stay away from Lù Dǐng later, absorb more of the pool's essence himself, and when they got out, as soon as Lù Dǐng fired the first shot, he would immediately follow suit! What's a coach, anyway? The academy didn't have a rule saying they couldn't hit coaches. No, wait, it was challenging coaches. As students, wouldn't it be reasonable for two students to challenge one coach? Since you chose to show favoritism⁴ and disregard the academy's rules, you were the one who broke the rules first, so don't blame us.\n\nThe two exchanged no words, turning to walk in opposite directions. From beginning to end, there was only eye contact, not a single word spoken. But in his mind, Bái Hèmián was already secretly planning his combo moves.\n\nHe knew he wasn't as strong as Lù Dǐng, so he needed to play a good support role, not aiming to cause significant threat to the coach. At least he'd hard control him for three seconds!!\n\nAs all the students changed their clothes, Huángfǔ Língyún was helped up, standing disoriented and dazed. His eyes still couldn't focus.\n\nThen, a man dressed in a head coach uniform walked out. His demeanor was iron-blooded, and he even looked somewhat human. He said, \"Looks like you're all full of vitality.\"\n\nHe scanned the crowd, his gaze finally landing on Lù Dǐng, his smile looking somewhat menacing. \"Since that's the case, I won't waste any more breath. Just one thing: this pool water is good stuff, so absorb it fiercely! I'm not afraid you'll absorb too much, only too little. Absorbing a lot means you're not wasting it.\"\n\n\"Now, into the pool!!!\"\n\nAll the students jumped into the blood pool, which was full of talismans, with deeper and shallower areas divided based on whether they had received a training award.\n\nThen came a shout: \"Open the sluice gates and release the water!!!!\"\n***\n¹ A glimpse through a tube (管中窺豹 - guǎn zhōng kuī bào): An idiom meaning to get only a partial view or understanding of something.\n² King Yama's Roll Call (閻王點卯 - yán wáng diǎn mǎo): An idiom meaning to be marked for death, or to be put on the spot, to be in a very difficult or dangerous situation.

besides himself, how could it accommodate anyone else?\n\nNot to mention Lu Ding had even beaten him up.\n\n\"I can't beat you in a fight, but I can't even beat you at absorbing pool water?\"\n\nHuangfu Lingyun gritted his teeth.\n\nHe had originally intended to take it slow, because the medicinal effect of this pool water was too terrifying.\n\nIf one absorbed large amounts at the beginning, it would damage the meridians.\n\nThis was like an intravenous drip; you couldn't infuse it too quickly, or it would increase the burden on your heart and lungs.\n\nBut now, Lu Ding's posture.\n\nIt was completely as if he was absorbing with all his might.\n\nHuangfu Lingyun's thoughts stirred.\n\nDamn it, if you're not afraid, I'm not either!\n\nLittle did he know, Lu Ding had already experienced such things several times; the resilience of his meridians was something no one present could compare to.\n\nHe'd found using Tai Sui Honey little by little too slow, so he'd poured an entire bottle in directly, even mixing it with other heavenly materials and earthly treasures, making foam when poured into the bathtub.\n\nA ruthless person who ended up stewing himself in an iron pot.\n\nYou compare yourself to him??\n\nHuangfu Lingyun activated his cultivation technique to increase his suction.\n\nBehind him, a vision manifested.\n\nA Golden Imperial Hall, a coiled dragon throne, a python on the verge of transforming into a flood dragon, and a jade imperial seal held in its mouth.\n\nThe instructors on the shore cast their gazes.\n\nSuddenly, the cry of a bird of prey sounded.\n\nIn the pool, behind Nuo Min, clouds rose, and beneath the blue sky and white clouds, a vast grassland stretched out, as a Sea Eastern Falcon flapped its wings and flew, extraordinarily magnificent.\n\nThe group of instructors commented.\n\n\"Lu Ding's talent is excellent, but in these aspects, he still can't compare to Huangfu Lingyun and Nuo Min.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Nuo Min is favored by the Eternal Heaven, and the spirit of the Sea Eastern Falcon always accompanies her. Huangfu Lingyun has the python on the coiled dragon throne, an aspect of devouring the heavens – this is the favor of destiny.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, there's no one perfect person.\"\n\n\"Listen to yourselves spouting nonsense, Song Chunfeng, stop trying to belittle one to praise another. A vision? What does it matter if there's a vision, or if there isn't?\"\n\n\"This is like if they're all students, you don't compare who studies better, but who eats more. Isn't that just sick?\" Lu Ting spoke up righteously from the side.\n\nLu Ding was recruited by him; he had to protect him.\n\nWhen Lu Ding had previously fought Huangfu Lingyun, this Song Chunfeng had been unfairly biased.\n\nLu Ting had already been very displeased then; he was just about to speak up to support, but Lu Ding's expression changed too quickly, and he couldn't react in time, so he didn't say anything.\n\nHe could only hold it in.\n\nNow he finally had a chance to retort to Song Chunfeng.\n\n\"We are all Qi Refiners; what we compare is talent and ability. And you talk about the favor of destiny? If the favor of destiny was useful, why couldn't Huangfu Lingyun, whom you recruited and who cultivated much longer than Lu Ding, last a few rounds?\"\n\nYou were the one who implicitly criticized first.\n\nThen don't blame me.\n\nNo sooner had he finished speaking.\n\nIn the pool, Bai Hemian, who had originally remained quiet and unexpressive, suddenly unleashed his power.\n\nBehind him, a ghostly image of a mountain of corpses manifested, riddled with countless holes, and a tide of corpses surged forth.\n\nA massive vortex appeared.\n\nOne was at the very front with Lu Ding, and the other at the very back.\n\nBoth sides exerted force simultaneously, like two ravenous wolves, tearing at the large, fatty meat that was the blood pool.\n\nAlthough in some aspects, he was not as good as Lu Ding.\n\nBut Tai Sui Blood was still blood, and though he was human, his other half was a living corpse.\n\nFor a living corpse, things like flesh, blood, and spiritual materials were part of their diet, proper ingredients.\n\nBloodline suppression, innate advantage.\n\nSong Chunfeng wore an 'I told you so' expression, adding: \"Even Bai Hemian has a vision.\"\n\nLu Ting was instantly choked, though his fists were more effective than Song Chunfeng's, his mind was a step behind.\n\nSong Chunfeng used retreat as advance, praising Bai Hemian.\n\nMaking Lu Ting somewhat at a loss for words.\n\nThis was like someone calling you short, and just as you cursed them, they said: \"Although you're short, you're actually quite handsome.\"\n\nThey both praised and cursed you, so if your mind didn't turn fast enough, you really wouldn't know what to say.\n\nBut this awkward situation didn't last long.\n\nThen, with a rumble, within the cave, water vapor accumulated out of thin air, gathering into dark clouds, and thunder boomed from within them.",

    "content": "A pair of chaotic pupils lit up in the mist.\n\nWith a single glare, the great python behind Huangfu Lingyun, perched on the dragon throne, instantly tumbled and fell out of sight.\n\nThe gyrfalcon soaring behind Nuomin flapped a few times, shedding a few feathers before flying far away.\n\nAlthough the vicious dragon's appearance was but for a moment, they understood its meaning.\n\n\"Scram! Don't make me whip you!!\"\n\nA python, a gyrfalcon, facing a vicious dragon with chaotic pupils—they weren't in the same league. Their manifestations were merely supernatural phenomena driven by cultivation methods; their own selves were frail. No matter how high their future potential, or how formidable they might become, if they weren't capable now, they simply weren't.\n\nAnd the Vicious Dragon Bone Script that Lu Ding cultivated was genuinely shed from a vicious dragon. Comparing the two, it was like an adult beating a child.\n\nAside from Lu Ding himself, consider another condition for cultivating the Vicious Dragon Bone Script: the Heavenly Fiend Lone Star¹. Just the arrival of such a person would be enough for these people to be unable to suppress or kill them. Not to mention Lu Ding was in a state of unity of Heaven and Man, uninhibited. Supernatural phenomena? A joke! Just look up at the sky; that's the greatest supernatural phenomenon.\n\nLu Ting smiled.\n\nSong Chunfeng felt a bit awkward. He knew the reputation of the Vicious Dragon Bone Script. \"The cultivation method is good.\"\n\nWith a passive-aggressive tone, as if no one could understand, Lu Ting retorted, \"Good, huh? Want to practice it? If you want to, I'll pay the contribution points. I'll buy a replica and give it to you. You practice it!!\"\n\nSong Chunfeng: Me? Practice it?\n\nSo my entire family, old and young, from top to bottom, I don't want them anymore, right? Not living the rest of my life?\n\nHe wouldn't dare cultivate that thing. He fell silent, feeling chagrined.\n\nInside Lu Ding's body, spiritual energy propelled the pool water, flushing through his meridians, with the miniature vicious dragon rampaging within. Several times, the Spirit Sea seemed within reach, almost about to burst into it, but then a sudden brake stopped it. It wasn't that it dared not rush, but that it couldn't. The procedure wasn't complete yet.\n\nHe had to first reach the Divine Palace, then the Dragon-Locking Well, then break out of the well, carrying the river to rush the sea, and finally purify the evil and become a dragon, leap over the Dragon Gate, and achieve ultimate sublimation.\n\nTo put it simply, he had to wait. Good things are worth waiting for.\n\nThe miniature vicious dragon turned around in the meridians and charged back! It began to run wild!\n\nLu Ding ignored it. With the vicious dragon leading the way and engulfing the spiritual energy in his meridians, Lu Ding's spiritual energy output speed and quantity were now more than double what they originally were. In other words, the same spell, when used by him, produced at least double the effect compared to someone cultivating an ordinary True Resolution cultivation method.\n\nThis change was just beginning. Lu Ding reversed his hand seals.\n\nA voice echoed in the Spirit Sea space: \"Divine Palace, rise!!!!\"\n\nParticles of light floated out from the blood-stained sea.\n\nOutside, waves of immense pressure surged!\n\nSomeone exclaimed, \"Lu Ding is about to break through to the Divine Palace realm!!!\"\n\nCountless eyes turned towards him. They saw Lu Ding sitting in the center of a ten-meter vortex, and waves of Divine Palace realm fluctuations radiated from his body.\n\nAs the fluctuations spread, what returned was everyone's astonishment.\n\n\"This... this is too much. After the Blood Pool, it's learning. How is he going to learn?\"\n\n\"A group of students are all in the Spirit Sea realm, and he went to the Divine Palace!?\"\n\n\"And as far as I know, Lu Ding knows various types of spells for different purposes: flying, confinement, damage, physical body, searching, etc.\"\n\n\"What's even more outrageous is that most of them are perfected. This... it's hard to teach him.\"\n\n\"How do you know they're perfected?\" someone asked, puzzled.\n\nSomeone else replied, \"Hick, don't you have a phone? Go search for his combat videos! He raises his hand and casts spells, opens his mouth and summons whatever he needs. They're all flawless spells! If that's not perfected, then what is it, tell me?\"\n\nDivine Palace!!!\n\nHuangfu Lingyun only felt stifled inside. It hurt here! Excruciating pain!\n\nHe hadn't even broken through to Divine Palace yet. Why could Lu Ding cultivate so quickly? Isn't it just about fighting with your life? I have a life too; I can fight too.\n\n\"Suck, damn it!!\"\n\nHuangfu Lingyun once again increased the efficiency of his cultivation method, wanting to freeload from the Blood Pool to boost his realm like Lu Ding. But he would never know that his meridians, compared to Lu Ding's, were like the difference between a broad highway and a muddy path.\n\n\"Poof!!!\"\n\nA mouthful of fresh blood gushed from Huangfu Lingyun's mouth. The burden was too great; his body ultimately couldn't bear it.\n\nThe Chief Instructor glanced at him: \"Talent is acceptable, but lacking in resolve. Take him away; he has no fate with the Blood Pool.\" If he continued to absorb, he would only die there.\n\nHuangfu Lingyun was unwilling to give up. This opportunity, a great opportunity, just slipped away... His eyelids grew heavier and heavier until he finally fell into darkness.\n\nSong Chunfeng's face dropped a bit.\n\nHe looked at several water pipes, releasing the mixed liquid of Tai Sui Blood and heavenly materials at maximum flow. The Chief Instructor's worry had just begun to surface.\n\nThere were hurried footsteps. \"Old Li, the one below is getting a bit angry. Says he's drained too much and his body can't take it. We agreed on once a year, with a fixed amount.\"\n\n\"This time alone equals several years' worth from before. This... what do we do?\"\n\n\"What do we do? Tell it that the Tai Sui Blood *must* be enough. If I drain a lot today, I can also make it replenish a lot.\" Saying this, he looked at Lu Ding, who was still revving up in the pool. He muttered to himself. Is this kid's Spirit Sea simply enormous, or is his physique special? How can he absorb so much? If his Spirit Sea is big, just how big could it be??? A true 'sea' of spirit?\n\nHe continued, \"Anyway, there's nothing more to teach him in terms of spells. Once he's recuperated, let him go alone to gather intelligence and slay dragons to compensate that old thing.\"\n\n*Boom*!!!!!!!\n\nThe Chief Instructor froze, his expression somewhat stiff as he looked towards Bai Hemian's location.\n\n\"Forget it, let those two team up and go first.\"\n\nAt this moment, Bai Hemian had already used up the medicinal effect of the Yi Wood Knot. His old wounds from being punished for killing a teammate had recovered, and combined with his past accumulations, he had built up a thick foundation for a powerful burst. At this moment, he too was about to charge into the Divine Palace!\n\nCompared to Lu Ding's short cultivation time, Bai Hemian felt that his own cultivation was too slow, too slow!!\n\nHe had to be even faster!!!\n\nThe vortex diameter expanded again.\n\nThe Chief Instructor's face turned somewhat greenish-black. \"Bring me my whip; I'll go down myself.\"\n\n\"Old Li, why don't you keep an eye on things here? Yunhai 749 specifically warned us about their temperaments—those two hold grudges. Just now...\" The instructor said, glancing at Song Chunfeng not far away.\n\nHe added, \"When they were in the Spirit Sea realm, they dared to fight a Si Ming, especially one known for defense like Shi Gandang. Their coordination was simply unbelievable, their combat power was off the charts, and as for their guts, there's no need to even mention it.\"\n\n\"Now Lu Ding is in the Divine Palace, and Bai Hemian's posture suggests he's also about to charge into the Divine Palace. If those two start fighting later, it'll be hard to handle if you're not here.\"\n\nThe Chief Instructor didn't even think. \"Then let them fight! It never said you couldn't fight an instructor. Didn't you see the sign hanging at the entrance?\"\n\n\"Which line there says you can't hit an instructor? What's wrong with instructors? Instructors also have to follow *my* rules. *I* am the Chief Instructor. Even *I* have to follow *my* rules. What's so special about an instructor? Playing favorites, interfering in others' grievances—they'll have to take it. This place goes by the rules on the sign!\"\n\n\"Besides, if I don't go down, will that guy down there just casually let these two wolf cubs keep draining blood?\"\n\nAn instructor holding a long whip walked over. The Chief Instructor bypassed the instructor blocking his way, reached out, and took the long whip embedded with some kind of metal fragments. He flexed his arm. \"Go on, go to the side, don't block the way!\"\n\n---\nFootnote:\n¹ Heavenly Fiend Lone Star (天煞孤星): A Chinese concept referring to a person whose astrological destiny is to be solitary, bringing misfortune or calamity to those around them, particularly family members.",

    "content": "「You ate your fill for a few days, pampered it like an ancestor, and now that it’s your turn to put in effort, you actually think you’re an ancestor?」\n\n「I still don’t believe I can’t handle you!!」\n\nHe strode into the guarded passage next to the cave.\n\nThe instructor left behind wore a helpless expression, turning his head left and right, looking this way and then that way.\n\nHe was truly worried sick.¹\n\n「Being an instructor is really not easy!!」\n\nUltimately, he decided to stay.\n\nSong Chunfeng couldn’t be beaten to death, and Lu Ding and Bai Hemian absolutely couldn’t get into trouble.\n\nThey were both first-year new investigators.\n\nTheir talents were so terrifying; to put it bluntly, give them time to grow, and they’d be human nuclear bombs in the future. They were strategic resources.\n\nThey had to be well protected.\n\nAs for Song Chunfeng?\n\nOld Li, that chief instructor, had to abide by his own rules. You, an instructor, interfering in a student’s combat.\n\nThat’s provoking first. If you provoke, you get beaten, who do you blame?\n\nAs long as he doesn't die.\n\nTime passed minute by minute; in the blink of an eye, half the night had gone by.\n\nIn the pool, the scenes varied.\n\nAs the saying goes, two flowers bloom, each branch tells its own story.²\n\nLook here: dark black clouds roiled, an Evil Dragon lurked, revealing half a claw, a piece of scale, its fierce might palpable.\n\nLook there: a grayish, misty Yin Mountain stood tall, a corpse revealed its head, half its body unseen, a single eye, a ferocious mouth smiling.\n\nSuddenly, the Evil Dragon turned its head, and the clouds and mist thinned.\n\nLook!!\n\nThose yellow vertical pupils stared directly, asking if you were scared.\n\nAt that instant, the Corpse King tilted its head, and the Yin Mountain receded.\n\nListen!!\n\nThose footsteps rapidly approached from far to near, daring you to run.\n\nSuddenly, a loud shout rang out, and spiritual energy surged.\n\n「Yin Domain Overlap, Corpse Ridge Mountain!!!」\n\nBai Hemian burst forth from the blood pool—this was something no one had anticipated. His Divine Palace Realm cultivation was revealed beyond a doubt.\n\nHe initiated with an instantaneous cast, forming hand seals and pressing them into the air.\n\nSong Chunfeng vaguely felt the ground tremble.\n\nThe next moment, the earth bulged upwards.\n\nPushing him straight up into the sky.\n\nBeneath him, a tide of corpses surged, climbing mountains and scaling rocks.\n\nBeneath the black clouds, the Evil Dragon poked its head out.\n\nIt stirred up the rolling black clouds, with lightning flashing and thunder roaring.\n\nThe Evil Dragon extended its claw, tightly clutching the person’s head, its chaotic pupils staring directly into one's heart, and spoke in human words: 「The rules of the training ground don't seem to exclude instructors, do they?」\n\nA fist smashed out from within the black clouds, sweeping everything before it,³ with electric arcs wrapped around it.\n\nBOOM!!!!\n\nSong Chunfeng’s cheek suffered a heavy blow, the force transmitting from head to toe, and the Yin Mountain shattered.\n\nHis entire body fell downwards.\n\nThree seconds passed.\n\nSong Chunfeng’s consciousness recovered, and fierce intent appeared on his face.\n\nHe flipped over in mid-air to adjust his posture, spitting out a mouthful of broken teeth: 「You dare to attack an instructor!!!!?」\n\nBai Hemian manipulated Qi into claws with both hands, suddenly pulling upwards, accompanied by a cold laugh: 「Heh, instructor?」\n\nThe ground rumbled again, a high peak rose from flat ground, suddenly shooting up, its peak directly striking Song Chunfeng’s lower back, carrying him soaring towards the sky.\n\nIt was only then that the pained Song Chunfeng saw clearly.\n\nWhere was any Evil Dragon in the sky? There was only Lu Ding, who had long since clasped his fists high above his head, ready to smash down.\n\nAs Song Chunfeng was once again thrust before him by the mountain peak.\n\nLu Ding smashed down with his clasped fists, carrying a sharp, ear-piercing whistling wind.\n\nBOOM!!!!\n\nThe immense force landed solidly, a white ring of wind instantly burst open and surged, pushing out over a hundred meters away.\n\nThe mountain body shattered again, and a mouthful of fresh blood gushed from Song Chunfeng’s mouth.\n\n「Splurt!!」\n\nLu Ding spoke only after acting, flying down with crushing force, his words arriving with him: 「Assault? Instructor Song, according to the rules of our training ground, those who are provoked may ‘wantonly’ retaliate.」\n\n「You just not only interrupted my ‘wanton’ retaliation against Huangfu Lingyun, you also provoked me. Now it’s our ‘wanton’ retaliation phase.」\n\nBai Hemian’s spiritual energy circulated; he raised his hand and swept it upwards: 「So, this isn’t an assault, it’s reasonable! Legal! Compliant with rules!」\n\nChunks of mountain rock, each comparable in size to a building, flew upwards following his movement.\n\nThey met the falling Song Chunfeng with a smash, turning his downward fall into an upward flight.\n\nAt this moment, Song Chunfeng recalled the scene that had just unfolded.\n\nSo these two had planned from the beginning that as soon as they broke through to Divine Palace Realm, they’d immediately act, catching him off guard, giving him nowhere to hide?!\n\nDamn it, he clearly had a chance just now, he clearly had a chance to teach Lu Ding a lesson!!\n\nHe didn’t cherish it; he was fooled by Lu Ding’s quick change of face!!\n\nYou have this strength, yet you still play tactics, your intentions aren’t clean!!\n\nThoughts surged in Song Chunfeng’s mind, but Lu Ding’s fists and feet arrived again, scattering his thoughts.\n\nEvery move was powerful and heavy.\n\nWith every punch and kick landed on him, Song Chunfeng’s internal organs were shifting, and he spat out mouthfuls of fresh blood. Don’t look at how miserable he was now.\n\nBut Lu Ding knew that he was a second-layer Fate Commander Realm cultivator, after all.\n\nHow could he die so easily?\n\nThe mountain rocks flying up from below constantly caught Song Chunfeng’s body, pushing him upwards.\n\nLu Ding, flying down from above, landed punch after punch, kick after kick on Song Chunfeng. The immense force penetrated his body, shattering the mountain rocks behind him as well, scattering them across the sky.\n\nOne must know that when taking a blow, having something blocking behind you versus having nothing blocking behind you makes a huge difference in the damage received.\n\nAt this moment, Song Chunfeng was attacked from front and back, injured on both sides.\n\nHe had no power to fight back whatsoever.\n\nBai Hemian suppressed with Yin Domain Overlap, Lu Ding suppressed physically, while Bai Hemian constantly interfered, and then Lu Ding’s punches landed solid, interrupting his spiritual energy circulation.\n\nNow Song Chunfeng was a fish on the chopping block,⁴ at their mercy.\n\nBut it was easier said than done.\n\nSeamless cooperation was merely the basic condition.\n\nMost importantly.\n\nBoth Lu Ding and Bai Hemian possessed combat power that ordinary Divine Palace Realm cultivators could not.\n\nLu Ding, as the primary attacker, displayed to the fullest his grasp of timing, the linkage of his moves, and the precision of his strikes in combat.\n\nHe perfectly achieved speed, accuracy, and ruthlessness by mastering the unity of man and nature.⁵\n\nThe cheat-like level of power⁶ was something Lu Ding improvised on the fly; even if those geniuses were to meticulously replicate it, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to.\n\nAt this moment, the physical aesthetics of violence were being enacted.\n\nOther instructors who had some connection with Song Chunfeng couldn’t sit still.\n\nAlthough it was shameful for an instructor to be beaten by a student.\n\nBut you also had to see what kind of students they were.\n\nCould ordinary students compare to these two monsters?\n\n「Stop hitting him, stop hitting him, you’re going to beat him to death!!!!」\n\n「You are reasonable and compliant with rules, but you can’t do two-on-one, that’s not reasonable!!」\n\n「Stop, stop, stop, Lu Ding, Bai Hemian, stop quickly, Instructor Song can’t take it anymore!!」\n\nNo matter how much they shouted, Bai Hemian and Lu Ding’s coordination never stopped, and they didn’t even bother to acknowledge them.\n\nStop!\n\nEither beat you unconscious, or beat you to give you psychological trauma.\n\nOtherwise, it was impossible to stop.\n\nAs soon as they stopped, Song Chunfeng would have time to retaliate, and a furious Fate Commander Realm cultivator was no joke.\n\nThese few instructors were afraid Song Chunfeng would be beaten into serious trouble. Just as they were about to go up and pull them apart.\n\nJust then, they heard.\n\nA muffled sound exploded, making people dizzy and disoriented.\n\nThey turned their heads to look.\n\nLu Ting stood holding a pair of eight-edged plum blossom bright silver hammers, horizontally pointing his hammers directly at them:\n\n「What’s wrong!!? I’d like to see who dares to move today. A Fate Commander hitting a Divine Palace Realm cultivator, an instructor hitting a student, or was it that he interrupted someone’s retaliation first, and provoked later, a total of two times. What’s wrong with two-on-one!?」\n\nAlthough he might not be articulate, he knew how to go along with it.\n\nAs long as Lu Ding was articulate, that was enough.\n\nJust now, when Lu Ding and Bai Hemian suddenly burst into action, he went to get his weapon.\n\nHe missed out earlier and felt unhappy about it; now he absolutely had to catch up!\n\nHe was the one who took charge of these people. Song Chunfeng could protect Huangfu Lingyun, so why couldn't Lu Ting protect Lu Ding and Bai Hemian?\n\nNot only did he protect them, but he also brought along other instructors he had a good relationship with.\n\nBehind him, one instructor after another held golden-studded date-sun spears, plum blossom bright silver spears, thousand-forged ghost-faced tall shields, and shoulder-carried Green Dragon Crescent Blades.\n\nThis stance.\n\nYou dare to go up and break up the fight?\n\nThen perhaps, those weapons would probably be used on you.\n\nAbove the sky.\n\nA figure fell and crashed to the ground.\n\nOne look revealed it was Song Chunfeng.\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian landed close behind him.\n\nLu Ding half-bent at the waist, looking down condescendingly at Song Chunfeng, whose eyes could only be half-opened.\n\nIn a low voice and calm tone, he said: 「Don't you like to take sides,⁷ then get up and try to mediate one more for me.」\n\n---\n¹ **Worried sick:** Literally \"broke one's heart from worry,\" an idiom meaning to be extremely worried or stressed.\n² **Two flowers bloom, each branch tells its own story:** A common Chinese narrative transition, meaning \"While focusing on one storyline, another is also unfolding.\"\n³ **Sweeping everything before it:** Literally \"wind rolls scattered clouds,\" an idiom describing an overwhelming force or something done swiftly and thoroughly.\n⁴ **A fish on the chopping block:** An idiom meaning \"to be at someone's mercy\" or \"completely helpless.\"\n⁵ **Unity of man and nature:** A Taoist concept describing a state of perfect harmony between humanity and the natural world, here implying seamless integration of one's body and techniques.\n⁶ **Cheat-like level of power:** A contemporary term referring to using software cheats in games, here used metaphorically to describe an unusually high or \"broken\" level of power.\n⁷ **Take sides:** An idiom meaning to intervene in a dispute but unfairly favor one side.",

    "content": ".....\n\nCurrent Song Chunfeng, let alone getting up, found it difficult to even move a finger. He didn't know how many punches and kicks Lu Ding had just landed on him.\n\nLook at him, his eyes weren't eyes, his nose wasn't a nose, and his mouth wasn't a mouth.¹\n\nSwollen high, all squished together.\n\nHis lips moved weakly, but no sound came out.\n\nIn his state, Lu Ding couldn't make out what he wanted to say even by reading his lips.\n\nStraightening up, he walked towards the door.\n\nBai Hemiao followed, glanced down as he passed, his eyes scanning up and down. Although he didn't speak.\n\nBut it was clear he was cursing filthily.\n\nEnraged, Song Chunfeng spat out another mouthful of fresh blood, his two legs kicked, and he directly convulsed into unconsciousness.\n\nWalking out of the Blood Pool Gate.\n\nThe Counselor caught up, calling out.\n\n\"Lu Ding, Bai Hemiao.\"\n\nThe two stood straight, simultaneously shouting: \"Hello, Counselor.\"\n\nCounselor: ........\n\n\"Don't be like this, I'm a bit unaccustomed. Your attitudes changed too quickly.\"\n\nHe organized his thoughts.\n\n\"It's like this: given your special circumstances, Lu Ding, you are proficient in spellcraft and skilled in a full range of types.\"\n\n\"Bai Hemiao, you are half-human, half-corpse, with an overlapping Yin Domain.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, since both of you are now at the Divine Palace Realm, the Chief Instructor has decided to give you some time to rest and recuperate. You can decide the exact duration yourselves.\"\n\n\"Once your recuperation is complete, you can directly depart to Survey and Slay Dragons, skipping the learning phase.\"\n\nThis was a true exception. Primarily, it's rare for new investigators, cultivating for less than a year, to directly reach the Divine Palace Realm.\n\nEven if there were Divine Palace students this fast before.\n\nThey didn't possess such combat power.\n\nSong Chunfeng lying there was the best proof.\n\nAnd their coordination was seamless.\n\nTherefore, whether it was spellcraft, coordination, or anything else.\n\nThey didn't need to learn.\n\nMight as well let them rest.\n\nHearing these words.\n\nLu Ding's eyes shifted, pondering. Bai Hemiao looked over.\n\nJust then, Lu Ding said: \"We can just go directly, no need for rest.\"\n\nBai Hemiao nodded in agreement: \"Mm!\"\n\nRest?\n\nRest for what?\n\nSong Chunfeng wasn't dead, so it was best to leave quickly, letting him recover properly. When the two of them returned, Lu Ding didn't know how Bai Hemiao would be.\n\nBut as for him, he'd probably gain a significant chunk of strength again.\n\nBy then, if Song Chunfeng dared to act up again, it would be another brutal beating.\n\nDidn't expect that, did you?\n\nI've gotten stronger again!!\n\nStaying here to waste time waiting for him to recover, that would be problematic.\n\nThe Counselor looked at the two. This was truly decisive and efficient.\n\nStrictly demanding of themselves, absolutely no unnecessary rest.\n\nIf all the other students were like Lu Ding...\n\nIt seemed not so good, too intense, too much pressure.\n\nIt's better not to have too many people like this. A few are fine. If everyone were like this, it would truly increase their workload.\n\n\"Then... then would you come with me? To look at the target information?\"\n\nThe two followed behind the Counselor and left.\n\nArriving at the Advanced Study Ground's archive room.\n\nThe Counselor took an electronic device and connected it to their phones.\n\n\"Your phones are now permitted to log into our Advanced Study Ground's archive database. You can view further details there.\"\n\n\"For now, I'll just give you a brief overview.\"\n\n\"Currently, in my personal opinion, there are three main tasks suitable for you.\"\n\n\"Mainly, we didn't expect you to break through to the Divine Palace Realm so quickly and possess such combat power. Generally, the Survey and Slay Dragon information submitted to us from outside takes some time.\"\n\nAfter all, suitable Fengshui Dragon Veins aren't found everywhere.\n\nNor do they all need to be severed.\n\nSome places you need to keep them, as these things can play a role in both urban development and local economy.\n\nAnd most are good, able to cooperate.\n\nOnly uncooperative ones that cause trouble and eventually breed anomalies in the Dragon Vein Fengshui require Slaying and Surveying.\n\nAround this time every year, various regions of Dahan go out to conduct national land regularization, population censuses, and other such matters.\n\nThis is not only to understand Dahan in detail but also to provide suitable practice targets for Advanced Study Ground students after they've learned something.\n\nThe data hasn't even come out yet.\n\nThe ones available now are simply because these things caused trouble urgently. They started acting up before Dahan's various regions even began, so the submissions from outside came early.\n\nThe Counselor pulled out the data.\n\n\"Alright, let's look at the first one.\"\n\n[Ba'er Mountain Railway Construction Project]\n\n[Requires cutting through mountains and forests, causing a delay of two months. Reason for delay: Golden Toad Holding Egg Formation obstructing the path.]\n\n.....\n\n[Jinshan City New Capital Plan]\n\n[Requires relocating a city and breaking through districts, causing a delay of half a year. Reason for delay: Kou family occupying land to cultivate graves, refusing to move, retreat, or allow passage. Absorbing the qi and fengshui of half the city to cultivate a Dragon-Raising Coffin-Lifting Formation, absorbing wealth and fortune. Currently negotiating with the local 749 Branch Bureau, continuously delaying.]\n\n......\n\n[Minshan City Water Diversion Dam Project]\n\n[Requires digging through mountains and earth. Min Family's Benevolent Estate obstructing the path, a ten-li graveyard, a great ghost residing in a thatched hut, Thousand Corpses Bowing to the King Formation.]\n\nThose that could appear here wouldn't be insurmountable challenges.\n\nIf there really were such hard bones, the higher-ups would have long sent more powerful individuals.\n\nThe fact they're still here only indicates they're reserved for Advanced Study Ground students.\n\nLu Ding glanced at them, casually picking one.\n\n\"Then let's go to Jinshan City first?\"\n\n\"Alright, you decide for yourselves. Oh, by the way, this gourd can collect the Fengshui Dragon Veins after breaking the formation. When you return and hand it in, you'll receive a reward.\"\n\nThe Counselor handed over a purple-skinned gourd, thumb-sized.\n\nAfter Lu Ding took it, the gourd transformed into a ring and encircled his pinky finger.\n\n\"Alright, thank you, Counselor. If there's nothing else, we'll head off now.\"\n\nThe Counselor was momentarily stunned.\n\n\"Such a rush? It's not even dawn yet. How about you depart after sunrise?\"\n\nLu Ding looked at Bai Hemiao beside him: \"Are you sleepy? Do you need rest?\"\n\nBai Hemiao shook his head.\n\nLu Ding turned back to the Counselor: \"I don't need rest either, nor am I sleepy.\"\n\nCounselor: .......\n\nSo logical!!\n\nNo need for rest, not sleepy, what's there to do staying here?\n\nCan't learn anything, everywhere is deep mountains and old forests, nothing to play or see.\n\nLet alone Lu Ding and them.\n\nIf it weren't for work requirements, the Counselor wouldn't want to stay here either.\n\nAlthough he said that, he always felt something was off.\n\nHe had never led such students before.\n\nYunhai 749, huh...\n\nYou really had it good with this fine grain.\n\nActive, talented, strong, and even knows how to respect superiors.\n\nTsk.....\n\nThe Counselor felt a sour taste in his mouth.\n\nWhy weren't such investigators from his own district?\n\n\"So you'll descend the mountain on your own?\"\n\nThis place doesn't even have roads connected.\n\n\"No problem, we'll go down ourselves.\"\n\nAfter Lu Ding waved goodbye, he led Bai Hemiao into the darkness.\n\nWho would have thought he'd already cleared half the Advanced Study Ground just after arriving.\n\nHis butt hadn't even warmed the seat yet, and he was already descending the mountain again.\n\n---\n¹ This is an idiom implying severe disfigurement due to beating or injury.",

    "content": "They hadn't even gone a few steps yet.\n\nFrom behind, Zhu Yixuan chased after them, shouting, \"Lu Ding, I'm also formidable at forging blades! If I can forge a blade for you that can withstand your power, will you take it then?\"\n\nLoaning or gifting a blade to Lu Ding had become his obsession.\n\nHe wasn't trying to rely on Lu Ding to help him nurture blades for cultivation or anything like that.\n\nPerhaps he had thought of that before, but now!!\n\nThe main thing was to prove a point, to prove that his Zhu family's blades were utterly incapable of failure!!!\n\nA blade loaner*, and you say his blades are no good?\n\nZhu Yixuan would rather you called him incompetent.\n\nBut you cannot criticize his blades.\n\nOtherwise, he'll get mad at you.\n\nBut precisely these words came from Lu Ding, and there was concrete proof.\n\nHe couldn't win a fight, nor could he argue his point.\n\nTherefore, Zhu Yixuan decided to forge a good blade for Lu Ding; he wanted to prove himself!!!\n\nTo prove that a blade loaner's blades were not cheap junk!\n\n\"Fine, go forge it, I thank you.\"\n\nLu Ding, with Bai Hemián, walked into the darkness without looking back.\n\nAs for Zhu Yixuan.\n\nLu Ding's assessment was that he was an okay person, just a bit stubborn.\n\nEagerly rushing to give him a blade.\n\nSoaring through the dense forest, Bai Hemián looked at the map information on his phone.\n\n\"Over a thousand kilometers. Relying solely on the evasion technique*, I probably won't make it before dawn.\"\n\nLu Ding: ......\n\nHearing this, he almost couldn't hold back his laughter.\n\nThis was a classic one-track mind.\n\n\"Is there a possibility that we're modern people and don't need to live this hard life? What if we take an airplane?\"\n\nIf one of them flew and the other used their evasion technique, even Lu Ding would get tired.\n\nHis body could be ignored, but his mind would get tired.\n\nIt's no different from driving. Driving for several hours always leads to fatigue.\n\n\"Oh, right.\"\n\nBai Hemián responded.\n\nHe then swiped his phone.\n\nSeeing that the nearest airport was only a little over a hundred kilometers away.\n\n\"Hmm, very close.\"\n\nThe two walked side by side.\n\nSoon.\n\nDawn broke in an alley somewhere in Beinan City.\n\nLu Ding picked up some rice noodles, dipped them in sauce, stuffed a large mouthful into his mouth, then took a piece of pork liver.\n\nA wonderful flavor exploded in his mouth.\n\nBeside him, Bai Hemián called out, \"Boss, another serving for me.\"\n\nThis was already his third serving.\n\n\"How is it? Not bad, right?\"\n\nLu Ding asked.\n\nBai Hemián nodded, \"Delicious. Never had it before.\"\n\n\"It's my first time too. I used to hear that the Sapian* here was delicious, but never tried it. Eating it today, it's indeed fragrant!\"\n\nBai Hemián was a bit puzzled, \"Isn't this rice noodles? Why is it called Sapian?\"\n\n\"It seems their dialect translates it that way; I don't really understand either. Just eat it. Once we're done eating, we'll fly to Jinshan.\"\n\n\"Boss, another serving for me too.\"\n\nFor Lu Ding, life wasn't just about fighting and killing; it was also about enjoyment. It didn't always have to be grand feasts; local delicacies and local customs were also forms of enjoyment.\n\nHe had never experienced these before, and he was determined to experience them all.\n\n.....\n\nJinshan Prefecture-level City.\n\nNews that students from the advanced training ground were coming out soon spread here.\n\nJinshan 749 Prefecture-level City Branch Office.\n\n(The 749 Bureau is divided into: Headquarters, Regional Headquarters (like Yunhai and Yaodou), Prefecture-level City Branch Offices, and Outposts.)\n\nIn a certain meeting room.\n\n\"Weren't students just sent to the advanced training ground? How could someone come out so quickly?\"\n\n\"Who knows? But anyone who can come out so quickly must be a tough character, absolutely!\"\n\n\"Could it be Huangfu Lingyun? I heard he opened his apertures with the Imperial Seal; he certainly has the qualification to come out early.\"\n\nThe girl sitting in the corner pushed up the large, black-framed glasses on her face.\n\nShe softly said in a gentle tone, \"It could also be Lu Ding and Bai Hemián. They are this year's dark horses; they definitely possess extraordinary abilities.\"\n\n\"And they even fought a Fate-Command Realm expert together. A new report came out recently, stating that Lu Ding alone swept through Black Mountain and killed Ye Chengfeng, a Fate-Command Realm expert.\"\n\nEach year, quite a few new investigator recruits become famous, but not so many that they are unmemorable.\n\nThere are always a few who leave a deep impression.\n\nJust cross-reference the data, and you can usually guess about right.\n\nEveryone agreed, it was also possible.\n\n\"But no matter who it is, coming at this stage probably won't be very effective. Ye Chengfeng was old and infirm.\"\n\n\"But Kou Huaiyi from the Kou family isn't that old. He's a genuine Fate-Command Realm expert.\"\n\n\"Any student who just came out won't be of much use.\"\n\n\"By the way, have you seen Cui Zao?\"\n\nOriginally, the first team members who weren't on missions today were waiting here for the students coming out of the advanced training ground, to discuss the Kou family matter and incidentally welcome them.\n\nXindu was their responsibility.\n\nNow their captain had gone to pick up the people from the advanced training ground.\n\nThe others were here.\n\nSo, where was Cui Zao, who also wasn't busy?\n\nOnly then did everyone realize.\n\nThe current period was special; they had to ensure the safety of every teammate.\n\nWhat if there was a large-scale confrontation? Although this was Lu Ding and their trial mission.\n\nBut once it reached that stage, they were all colleagues from 749, and without any grudges, no one could just stand by and watch.\n\nUnity is strength!\n\nLet's go at them together!\n\n\"Can't get through on the phone!\"\n\n\"No reply to messages either!\"\n\n\"I just sent him the last message at 7:56 AM. Does anyone have a later one than me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I do, I do! I have one, from 8:10 AM. Cui Zao said he might arrive late because some Kou family members were causing trouble on the road.\"\n\n.....\n\nMeanwhile, on the airport avenue.\n\nLi Kai drove and spoke, \"I've heard your names for a long time. Spirit Sea and Fate-Command? I couldn't even imagine it. If it were...\"\n\nDing-dong.\n\n\"You have an urgent message from colleague Lou Yuan.\"\n\nLi Kai took out his phone.\n\n[Captain, Cui Zao hasn't arrived. His phone is unreachable, and he's not replying to messages. This morning, he said he saw Kou family members causing trouble on the road.]\n\n[We just checked the surveillance footage and found no direct angle, but we saw Cui Zao's car, and before that, Kou Jingshen's car passed by there.]\n\nLi Kai's expression darkened.\n\n\"My apologies, Lu Ding. I originally wanted to give you a welcome, but now I have an urgent matter. I'll drop you off at the bureau later, but I need to excuse myself first.\"\n\nSeeing his grim expression.\n\nLu Ding leaned forward slightly, his body leaving the backrest, and said, \"No need to be so polite. If you have an urgent matter, just turn around and go to the location. If there are demons, monsters, or ghosts, I can help too.\"\n\nMainly because he hadn't killed these things in too long.\n\nAfraid of losing his touch.\n\nIn the recent few battles, all his actions were about leaving them alive.\n\nOr he couldn't fully unleash his power.\n\nLu Ding was very displeased.\n\nMoreover, he hadn't used 'Floral Coffin of Deadly Burial' yet. If they got there and encountered a powerful ghost or monster causing trouble, he'd be in luck!\n\nHe secretly had some expectation that this Captain Li would say, upon opening his mouth, that ghosts and monsters were causing trouble.\n\nThe result was.\n\nAs soon as Captain Li spoke.\n\n\"It's not demons, monsters, or ghosts. It's the Kou family causing trouble. One of my investigators can't be reached. We were originally going to have a meeting at the bureau and welcome you, have a meal together, and extend our local hospitality once you arrived, but now......\"\n\nAnyway, it wasn't anything confidential, so he just said it.\n\n---\n*   **Blade loaner**: A specific type of individual or organization in the story that loans out blades, often with associated cultivation practices.\n*   **Evasion technique**: Refers to a supernatural method of extremely fast travel, often involving bursts of speed or short-range teleportation.\n*   **Sapian**: A type of rice noodle dish, usually a cold dish with a unique sauce, popular in certain regions of China like Yunnan.",

    "content": "......\n\nBut unexpectedly, as soon as these words were uttered, the light in Lu Ding's eyes instantly vanished, becoming as calm as an ancient well, and there was even a hint of irritation that didn't show on his face.\n\n\"The Kou family is causing trouble? So you're going to the Kou family to demand someone now?\"\n\n\"Not to the Kou family. The one causing trouble is Kou Jingshen, the second young master of the Kou family, president of Kou Real Estate Group.\"\n\nOn the way here, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian had looked at the Kou family's data.\n\nHowever, their focus was on Kou Huaiyi, the Kou family's Siming Realm Qi Cultivator.\n\nAs for the young masters and young ladies below, both of them had merely skimmed over them, only needing to remember that such people existed.\n\nWhat era is this, still \"young master\" and \"young lady\"?\n\nAren't they afraid of being laughed at if they say it out loud?\n\n\"Then let's go directly to him, taking us with you.\"\n\nLu Ding said this.\n\nOriginally, on the way here, he and Bai Hemian had thought this:\n\nForget about this and that, don't want anything. Procedures, chaotic complexities, all of it can get lost.\n\nJust go straight to their doorstep.\n\nStand firm right at the Kou family's entrance.\n\nHolding the documents, first ask if they'll move. Judging by the Kou family's past attitude, they definitely wouldn't.\n\nGood.\n\nSo you won't move, huh?\n\nI've notified you, alright? You're the one who won't move. The recorder has it all down.\n\nThen tear up the document and directly make a move.\n\nWho spoiled them?!\n\nYou've truly been given too much face. We talked nicely, but you won't move. Benefits have been given, compensation has been given, and you've enjoyed this fengshui formation for so long.\n\nSuch a large family and business.\n\nIsn't that enough?\n\nThis fengshui arrangement is entirely a form of cheating. You cheated before; your ancestral grave is buried there. We're all Great Han people, and we know how important this is to a family.\n\nWe won't touch it.\n\nWho doesn't have an ancestral grave? We can understand that.\n\nBut now the city needs to develop. You've absorbed geomantic energy and fengshui for so long, nearly half the city's geomantic energy and fengshui have been sucked up by you. Do you still want to stubbornly stay?\n\nIsn't that excessive?\n\nSince you like to climb onto our faces*, then we'll teach you a lesson!\n\nThe reasonable approach has been tried, but it was useless. Now comes the unreasonable duo.\n\nLu Ding also understood clearly: he came to take action. As for reasoning, if reasoning worked, he wouldn't be here.\n\nSo, he didn't want to say any more nonsense.\n\nHearing Lu Ding say that they both wanted to go too,\n\nCaptain Li's hand trembled, and he turned his head to glance over.\n\nBai Hemian was fine, but Lu Ding's way of doing things, well......\n\n\"Lu Ding, ah, it's better not to resort to force if possible. Kou Group is quite large, providing many employment opportunities and such. Someone submitted a report requesting a conciliatory approach.\"\n\nHearing this, Bai Hemian's lips slowly curled into a smirk.\n\nHe didn't speak.\n\nHis tongue wasn't too quick, so he wouldn't interfere. Just follow along and take action.\n\nLu Ding spoke up: \"Conciliatory approach? Submitted a report? Who submitted it?\"\n\nThree questions made Captain Li instantly sweat profusely.\n\nAt this moment, he felt immense pressure.\n\nThe words churned in his mind repeatedly; he almost didn't dare to speak, fearing that if the name came out, it would be King Yama's book of life and death.\n\nLu Ding also saw his difficulty.\n\n\"If the higher-ups really wanted a conciliatory approach, they wouldn't have called me.\"\n\nThis was the advantage of one's persona. With his persona established, his presence represented the attitude of the higher-ups.\n\nMany things had already been tacitly approved.\n\nIt's like an ancient emperor wouldn't call a tender-hearted weakling or bleeding-heart saint to do something like exterminating a family and wiping out their lineage.\n\nUnless the emperor wanted to leave that family a way out.\n\nHearing this, Captain Li's heart was further startled.\n\nLu Ding continued.\n\n\"So, whoever submitted the report, write a report for me, and I'll take it back. Whether the mistake is big or small, the higher-ups will decide. I'm here to get things done.\"\n\n\"Whether the Kou family remains or is wiped out depends on their attitude. Of course, local practical issues must also be considered.\"\n\n\"How about this?\"\n\nLu Ding took out his phone, opened the files, pointed at Kou Huaiyi's third son, the illegitimate son Kou Jingming, and said: \"This person's profile is quite good, and his abilities are decent.\"\n\n\"His character is also fine. While expanding the Kou family's company might not be possible, maintaining it is no problem.\"\n\n\"If the disappearance of your investigators is truly related to Kou Jingshen, and he cooperates and explains, I can be a bit gentle. But if he doesn't cooperate and still tries to show off......\"\n\nLu Ding didn't say the rest, but Captain Li understood.\n\n\"At that time, the honest and ordinary people of the Kou family, after the fengshui formation is broken, will all be placed under Kou Jingming's management. The Kou family company's affairs will also be handed over to him.\"\n\n\"Anyway, they're all family, so they can handle it however they want.\"\n\n\"Of course, this premise is if they don't cooperate, don't move, and don't retreat. If they change their minds at the last minute, then the Kou family will remain as it was before.\"\n\nBut Lu Ding estimated that cooperation was unlikely.\n\nThe more Captain Li listened, the more alarmed he became.\n\nIf that were the case, things would get too big.\n\nAlthough it was all within the Qi Cultivator circle, still......\n\nAfter much deliberation, he said, \"Lu Ding, ah, actually you can go handle the Kou family's matters. I can handle things on my side.\"\n\nHow could a captain be indecisive? But then again, he couldn't reach Lu Ding's level either.\n\n\"No need to be polite, Captain Li, we're all colleagues.\"\n\n\"Originally, I had three plans: a low-tier plan that would cause too much trouble, a mid-tier plan that would cause you some bother, and a high-tier plan that I hadn't figured out before.\"\n\nSaying this, Lu Ding leaned back again: \"But now, I've figured it out.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nCaptain Li asked subconsciously.\n\n\"I've seen the data; the Kou family has always been very arrogant, they're the local tyrants here, so having a just cause* is very important.\"\n\nA JUST CAUSE!!!!\n\nCaptain Li's head exploded. At this moment, he even thought to himself, 'Kou family, oh Kou family, you'd better honestly move the grave! And Kou Jingshen, you'd damn well better not touch my team members!'\n\nHe had already figured out what Lu Ding was going to do.\n\nAttacking 749 investigators...\n\nThey certainly wouldn't dare to kill, but the severity of the word 'attack' would entirely depend on Lu Ding's mood.\n\nGiven the current posture, it's definitely an excuse to act, to have a just cause.\n\nAnd once this matter is settled, there will absolutely be no gossip or criticism externally.\n\nThe mission completion rate would be perfect.\n\nThe higher-ups would only praise him for doing a good job, after all, his very presence indicated everything.\n\nThe local authorities would have nothing to say either.\n\nWith one phrase: 'Attacking 749 investigators,' who would dare say another word?\n\nInside the car, silence reigned.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nInside the president's office on the top floor of Kou Group building.\n\nThe missing Cui Zao sat in front of Kou Jingshen, speaking with a serious expression: \"Kou Jingshen!!\"\n\n\"Can you stop looking so unperturbed? This is only the second day, and students have already come out of the Advanced Training Ground on the second day. Do I need to say more about the significance of this!?\"\n\n\"This is clearly aimed at your Kou family.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nKou Jingshen continued to process his work, speaking without lifting his head.\n\n\"You know? If you know, why aren't you going back to discuss it with your old man?\"\n\n\"I took such a great risk to bring you this news in advance, and you're treating me with this attitude now?\"\n\nThe more Cui Zao spoke, the more agitated he became.\n\nIt turned out he wasn't attacked; instead, he used the lack of surveillance there to get into Kou Jingshen's car.\n\nHe revealed the intelligence that students from the Advanced Training Ground would be arriving today.\n\nAs for an excuse, he had already thought of one: he had a conflict with the Kou family. Anyway, 749 investigators used to have conflicts with the Kou family.\n\nThe Kou family also knew their limits when it came to 749 investigators; they wouldn't cause major trouble.\n\n---\n*   *climb onto our faces*: An idiom meaning to take advantage of someone's kindness or tolerance to act with increasing audacity or disrespect.\n*   *just cause*: An idiom meaning to have a legitimate or righteous reason for action, especially a military campaign.",

    "content": "So when it's declared a misunderstanding, it can be reconciled; it's really not that big a deal.\n\n749 wouldn't disregard its investigators' personal wishes, right?\n\nAs for why not say it on the phone, or find someone to relay the message?\n\nIt's not ancient times now; it's the technological era. A phone, in front of 749, is like it's transparent.\n\nAs for relaying messages, one more person knowing means one more risk.\n\nCui Zao didn't want to take risks. His ability to inform Kou Jingshen was purely due to personal connection, and he also didn't want to lose his investigator's epaulets over this matter.\n\nThe crime of leaking intelligence is no small thing.\n\n\"So what attitude do you want to satisfy you? He's just a trainee. How powerful can he be, more powerful than a Siming Realm?\"\n\n\"That remark is a bit presumptuous. After all, the Kou family can't oppose 749, but aren't we talking now?\"\n\n\"Talking!?\"\n\nCui Zao's emotions were a bit agitated.\n\n\"Is that talking? You're dragging it out, dragging it until this matter fizzles out, gets postponed, giving concessions to your Kou family, preserving your Kou family's feng shui!!\"\n\n\"Why can't you think about it? Your Kou family's Dragon-Nurturing Coffin Formation is getting bigger and bigger. What do you want to do? Rebel!!\"\n\n\"The higher-ups are targeting the feng shui formation, not your Kou family. This thing's impact is too great. Nurturing one Kou family harms almost half of Jinshan. Ordinary people are always 749's bottom line!!\"\n\n\"Just a trainee, huh~ And what Siming Realm~\"\n\n\"An ordinary trainee can't do anything to a Siming Realm. I ask you, if Lu Ding comes, what will your Kou family do!!!?\"\n\n\"Siming? Hasn't he killed Siming? He's the Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke of Yunhai. In Linghai, he already dared to fight a Siming. This time, he received the trainee reward, what if he gets some powerful treasure?\"\n\n\"Once he breaks through to the Shenggong Realm, Siming, Siming my ass! He'll accumulate power and chop his way from the training ground all the way to Jinshan. Siming Realm? Your fucking ancestral graves will be chopped to pieces by him!\"\n\nThis was also why Cui Zao was in such a hurry to inform Kou Jingshen.\n\nOthers still had some leeway.\n\nHe was just afraid that it would be Lu Ding who came.\n\nStanding up, Cui Zao pointed at Kou Jingshen: \"I'll stop here. I'm telling you this because I consider you a brother.\"\n\n\"You think about it carefully. What's Lu Ding's nickname? Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke. A 749 investigator, with this nickname. If you don't know, you can go check it out.\"\n\n\"His working style, his methods, talk?\"\n\nAt this, Cui Zao sneered a few times: \"He'll talk to you standing on your grave, if you can still hear him.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'm leaving. Your Kou family has half a day at most.\"\n\nKou Jingshen, who had been listening for a while, saw Cui Zao about to leave and asked, \"Half a day.... Is it that urgent?\"\n\nCui Zao half-turned his body: \"That urgent? I'm not urgent. You can also not be urgent. But Lu Ding is a famous vanguard from Yunhai 749.\"\n\n\"If he says he'll deal with you in the morning, he'll roll out of bed and ask where your home is. If it's close, he'll be there immediately. If it's far, he'll be there by noon. You think about it.\"\n\nKou Jingshen stood up: \"I'll see you out.\"\n\nThe two walked out together and entered the CEO's private elevator. Just as they left, the phone on the desk rang, but he unfortunately didn't hear it.\n\nInside the elevator,\n\nKou Jingshen took out a cigarette and handed it to Cui Zao.\n\nSaying: \"Thanks.\"\n\nCui Zao took the cigarette: \"No need for thanks. I should be the one thanking you. A few years ago, I failed my college entrance exam. The pressure from my family was great, and I couldn't clear my head, so I jumped into the river.\"\n\n\"Who knew a big CEO like you would also like fishing and even save me?\"\n\nKou Jingshen smiled, his fingers rubbing the cigarette: \"Indeed. Who would've thought that someone who escaped by jumping into a river would become a 749 investigator?\"\n\n\"Besides, when I saved you back then, it was because I wanted to punch you. I had just baited my fishing spot the day before, and before I could even fish, you startled everything away!\"\n\nThe two looked at each other and smiled.\n\n.....\n\nDownstairs at Kou Group, people were sprawled everywhere.\n\nThe receptionist girl, who was on the phone, looked up and saw Lu Ding staring fixedly at her.\n\n\"Are you done tipping them off?\"\n\nHis usually handsome face couldn't win over strangers' favor today.\n\nThe girl nodded in fear, saying in a trembling voice: \"No... no one picked up, but... but, the private elevator came... came down.\"\n\n\"CEO Kou should also... also be down.\"\n\n\"Came down?\"\n\nLu Ding felt a bit regretful. How could he not have noticed the girl tipping them off?\n\nThe reason he didn't stop her was because he wanted to see if Kou Jingshen would try to flee out of fear of guilt.\n\nThat would be easier, just turn around and go to the Kou family.\n\nBut they came down instead.\n\nIt was a happy accident, perhaps.\n\nBut it was acceptable.\n\n\"Where's the CEO's elevator?\"\n\nThe girl raised a hand and pointed: \"Tha... that way, the golden one.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nLu Ding returned a smile.\n\nThe girl, somewhat afraid, said \"You're welcome.\"\n\nLu Ding turned and gestured with his head to Bai Hemian, who had finished fighting.\n\nThen he walked forward, came to the large man lying on the ground, and took out his 749 ID from his bag.\n\n\"Remember, in the future, when this ID is shown, you can not cooperate, you can also be dissatisfied, but you must keep it to yourself.\"\n\n\"You can't show that deadpan expression of yours that says 'no matter who comes, it won't work,' otherwise I'll feel you're not respecting me.\"\n\nThe man nodded drowsily.\n\nWhat followed was a soccer kick, knocking him out cold.\n\nCaptain Li, standing nearby, just felt embarrassed!!!\n\nProblems in his own territory, yet he needed others to help solve them.\n\nJust now, he brought Lu Ding and the other, and as soon as the ID was shown, this man, who was a head taller than him, gave them an extremely disrespectful look.\n\nNo one had even spoken yet.\n\nLu Ding, from behind, swung a slap and smacked him, knocking out several teeth. The man spun in circles from the hit.\n\nBai Hemian followed up with a kick.\n\nThe man instantly flew back over ten meters.\n\nThen it was just Bai Hemian alone, knocking out all these Qi refiners.\n\nLu Ding unknowingly took the lead, guiding the two to the CEO's elevator door.\n\n*Ding.*\n\nAs the elevator chime sounded and the gap opened, laughter emanated from inside.\n\nCaptain Li, with a puzzled look, frowned and called out: \"Cui Zao?\"\n\nLooking outside the elevator.\n\nA triangular formation: Lu Ding in the lead, with Captain Li and Bai Hemian on his left and right behind him.\n\nSeeing this scene.\n\nCui Zao's expression in the elevator instantly froze. Both their smiles receded.\n\nThey never imagined that Captain Li would appear here, and with... it *is* Lu Ding!!!\n\nHaving checked Lu Ding's profile, Cui Zao instantly recognized him.\n\nIt really was him who came this time!!\n\nAs is well known, smiles are transferable. When one person's smile disappears, it will inevitably transfer to another's face.\n\nNow, the smiles of both Cui Zao and Kou Jingshen disappeared. Therefore, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian smiled.\n\n\"Alright, alright, I get it. This is Infernal Affairs.\"\n\nAfter Lu Ding said this with a smile, he raised his leg and kicked both of them in the chest, one kick per person.\n\nUnder the force of the impact, the elevator shook, and the wall behind them deformed.\n\nThey slowly slid down, curled up in the corner of the elevator.\n\nLu Ding squatted down and ripped off the law enforcement recorder from Cui Zao's chest.\n\nHe opened it, and sure enough, it was off.\n\nLooking at his chest clothing again, there were no other creases besides those from just now.\n\nLu Ding subconsciously looked behind him, then belatedly remembered that Yan Feifan wasn't here.\n\nIf he were here, from his pouch of wonders, he could probably pull out a fingerprint scanning tool.\n\nThen, by checking if there were fresh fingerprints of a second person on it, he would know whether Cui Zao turned it off himself, or if someone else did.\n\nBut it didn't matter.\n\nA different method would work.\n\nHe held the law enforcement recorder and handed it to Cui Zao, who was still struggling to catch his breath.\n\n\"People need to be a little smarter. If you get another chance in the future, remember to have someone else turn off your law enforcement recorder for you. Don't turn it off yourself.\"\n\n\"Without other people's fingerprints, you can't even play the whole act.\"\n\nHearing this, amidst the pain, Cui Zao suddenly remembered that when he got into Kou Jingshen's car earlier, he had indeed turned off the law enforcement recorder himself.\n\nHis moment of thought made Lu Ding quietly raise his hand.\n\nWhen he looked up to try and explain, a slap, carrying the sound of wind, landed directly on Cui Zao's face.\n\n*Snap!!*\n\nWith a slap to the face, Cui Zao felt like his brain had flown out, instantly blacking out.",

    "content": "...\n\n“He…”\n\nHearing Captain Li say “he” from behind him, Lu Ding turned his head: “He what?”\n\n“Nothing… If he didn’t close it himself, why would he be thinking about this question? The fact that he can think about this question only indicates that he’s recalling whether someone else closed it or if he closed it himself.”\n\n“There are no tears or rips on his clothes. This also proves that it would only be like this if he closed it himself, as the enforcement recorder’s switch is very small.”\n\n“It’s impossible not to tear clothes during a struggle.”\n\n“Furthermore, bureau regulations state that the loss of an enforcement recorder is equivalent to a public security officer losing their firearm…”\n\nThe more he spoke, the more bitter Captain Li’s expression became. He truly hadn’t expected to have a team member who sided with outsiders.\n\nLu Ding stood up: “It seems Captain Li’s training scores must be excellent. You’ve said everything I wanted to say, and even managed to identify and correct oversights.”\n\nOriginally, these were words of praise.\n\nBut Li Kai felt like he couldn’t lift his head upon hearing them.\n\n“Xiao Bai, carry the two of them. We’re going to the Kou Family!”\n\nThis works out perfectly; there’s no need to say anything else.\n\nColluding with a 749 investigator, stealing 749 confidential information.\n\nAs for how to determine if this information is confidential?\n\nAre you kidding? The whereabouts of advanced training students—isn’t that confidential? They are all geniuses from various districts, capable of going to advanced training locations.\n\nThey are all meant to be heavily nurtured in the future.\n\nThe Kou Family has no kinship or ties with Lu Ding or Bai Hemi. Why are you staring at them?\n\nWhat?\n\nDo you want to ambush and assassinate them?!\n\nBai Hemi stepped forward. Kou Jingshen, still conscious, looked up at the three of them.\n\n“This is Jinshan, how dare you…”\n\n*Bang!!!!*\n\nBefore he could finish speaking, Bai Hemi had already learned Lu Ding’s essence.\n\nHe directly grabbed Kou Jingshen and ‘lifted him’*.\n\nA knee-kick to the stomach. The pain made his eyeballs bulge, and his face changed color, turning red then white.\n\nLu Ding, who had initially been standing sideways, turned to look at him.\n\n“Jinshan? That remark almost made me think Jinshan wasn’t under Dahan’s jurisdiction.”\n\n*Smack!!!*\n\nLu Ding casually slapped him. The elevator swayed, and Kou Jingshen’s cheek instantly swelled up.\n\nHe spread his hands: “Threatening a 749 investigator—your confidence merely stems from the Kou Family. Now I’ve slapped you, what can the Kou Family do for you?”\n\nAs he finished speaking, Lu Ding delivered another backhand slap.\n\n*Smack!*\n\n“Now, I’m not slapping you as a 749 investigator. I’m slapping you in my own name, Lu Ding.”\n\n“What can the Kou Family do for you then?”\n\nYou’re so used to being a CEO that you can’t see who’s in control of the situation.\n\nYour days are numbered; do you still dare to jump?\n\nLet alone Lu Ding’s identity as an investigator, even if he weren’t an investigator, with a twenty-year golden finger**, how dare you threaten him!?\n\nHe turned around, then turned back, delivering a kick to the solar plexus.\n\nKou Jingshen could no longer act arrogantly.\n\nWatching his chest cave in, and the spittle from his mouth turn from white to red.\n\nOnly then did Lu Ding say: “Let’s go!”\n\nBai Hemi carried the two men, following behind Lu Ding.\n\nAt this moment, Li Kai’s anger also flared up.\n\nOf course, not towards Lu Ding, but towards the lawless Kou Family.\n\nBefore, their swaggering was tolerable, at least regarding 749 investigators, the Kou Family had shown some restraint.\n\nBut after the plan from above came down…\n\nThe Kou Family refused to relocate their ancestral graves, delaying repeatedly, and now they’ve even colluded with internal 749 staff to leak information.\n\nBefore, the higher-ups had consistently avoided dealing with the Kou Family.\n\nOriginally, Li Kai couldn’t understand why, but now he understood: it was all to give the advanced training students some practice.\n\nNow the people from the advanced training facility have arrived.\n\nAnd it’s Lu Ding and Bai Hemi who have come.\n\nIs it too much for him to join in kicking them while they’re down?\n\nHe pulled out his phone and made a call.\n\n“Tell Squad One to bring all their gear and be ready to deploy outside the Kou Family residence at any moment.”\n\nThis is the advanced training students’ mission; they won’t participate.\n\nBut after they’re done fighting, they’ll need people for crowd control, right?\n\nThey’ll need people to maintain order, right?\n\nAnd if the Kou Family throws caution to the wind and mobilizes everyone, using superior numbers against fewer, they’ll need people, right?\n\nAt that time, what will await them is 749’s ready support team.\n\nIt’s a good opportunity to vent some anger accumulated recently.\n\nCarrying the two men, they walked out of the Kou Group building.\n\nJust as they reached the entrance.\n\nA girl in an exquisite long dress, accompanied by three to five Spirit Sea Realm Qi Refiners and an old man in the Divine Palace Realm, blocked the entrance, obstructing their path.\n\nLan Ya looked at Kou Jingshen, who was spitting blood-tinged foam, and a hint of heartache appeared in her eyes.\n\nShe tried her best to control her emotions, suppressing her anger as she spoke: “Investigator, could you give me some face and let go of Jingshen, so I can take him for treatment?”\n\nLan Ya, Kou Jingshen’s nominal fiancée.\n\nFrom the Dahan Qi Refiner family, the Lan Family.\n\nBelonging to Dahan’s second-tier families.\n\nYears ago, she was Kou Jingshen’s university classmate. After graduation, she followed in Kou Jingshen’s footsteps and came to Jinshan.\n\nHowever, Kou Jingshen didn’t particularly like her.\n\nHe liked the daughter of a farmhouse restaurant owner by the river where he often went fishing.\n\nLan Ya was a typical love-struck fool.\n\nLu Ding couldn’t understand. Although your Lan Family isn’t a top-tier Qi Refiner family, compared to the Kou Family, it’s completely the difference between a lion and a tiger versus a rabbit and a wild chicken.\n\nOf all people to fall for, she fell for Kou Jingshen.\n\nWhat did she see in him?\n\nDid she like his icy cold face, or that he went fishing in the middle of the night and always came back empty-handed (caught nothing)?\n\nOr was it for his family’s servant’s line, ‘This is the young master’s first time bringing a woman home’?\n\nIt’s almost become a cliché.\n\nHe looked at Lan Ya in front of him and asked: “Give *you* face?”\n\n“Is this ‘face’ for you, or for your surname?”\n\nLan Ya’s gaze fell on Li Kai. A 749 captain from a prefecture-level city actually stood behind this unfamiliar investigator.\n\nIt seemed his identity was either wealthy or noble; he must have come from a prominent place.\n\nBut no matter what, Jingshen, I will definitely save you!!\n\n“Is there a difference?”\n\n*Smack!!!*\n\nLu Ding raised his hand, infused it with Qi, and delivered a powerful slap that whistled through the air, sending her flying. Her body spun in mid-air before she landed on the ground, unconscious.\n\nHis voice followed: “No difference. Because neither you nor the Lan Family have any ‘face’ with me. I just wanted to toy with you, you dead love-struck fool of an ungrateful wretch.”\n\nThe Lan Family raised and nurtured her, and now she jumps out and asks if there’s a difference? Isn’t she just trying to wave the Lan Family’s banner?\n\nLu Ding being here means he represents the will of 749’s higher-ups. You jump out and use the Lan Family’s banner to obstruct official duties—isn’t that inviting trouble for the Lan Family?\n\nHave you asked the opinions of other Lan Family members?\n\nWhat is this if not an ungrateful wretch?\n\nYou can have your own life, and you can say being born into the Lan Family wasn’t your choice, but you could have entirely chosen not to use the Lan Family’s banner.\n\nYou could have righteously, with your Spirit Sea cultivation, declared, ‘I only represent myself.’\n\nLu Ding gave her the chance, but she didn’t say it.\n\nAs for Lu Ding’s decisive action, would it provoke the Lan Family and lead to retaliation?\n\nIf not decisive, should he have argued with her? There would only be two outcomes: either she takes the person away, or they fail to agree and start fighting.\n\nThe first possibility was minuscule, so it was better to just hit her directly.\n\nAs for the Lan Family, if they dare to come, let them. Do they truly think obstructing a 749 investigator’s official duties is a small matter?\n\nAnd still want ‘face’?\n___\n*   **‘lifted him’ (提干/tí gàn):** An idiom implying forcefully grabbing someone by their clothing (e.g., collar, shirt) to lift, pull, or control them, as if they were a handle.\n**   **golden finger (金手指/jīn shǒuzhǐ):** A common trope in Chinese web novels, referring to a cheat, special ability, or overpoweringly good fortune given to a protagonist, allowing them to easily overcome challenges.",

    "content": "The several Qi Refiners saw their master getting beaten.\n\nAmong them, the old man in the Spirit Palace Realm started to say, “You dare...”\n\nBang!!!!\n\nLu Ding raised his leg and delivered a direct kick, sending the old man in the Spirit Palace Realm flying, crashing through an iron tree, and falling deep into a flower bed, his life unknown.\n\n“I’m even bolder than you imagine.”\n\nAs for the other Qi Refiners in the Spirit Ocean Realm, they reacted quite quickly!\n\nInstantly, they squatted down with hands over their heads, obediently, their movements impeccably standard.\n\nLu Ding walked past them, heading outside.\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nNews of Kou Corporation being breached by Lu Ding and Bai Hemian reached the Kou family.\n\nIn the swimming pool.\n\nA man, shirtless and wearing swim shorts, with sunglasses on, floated on the water, enjoying the sun.\n\nBy the pool.\n\nA woman's slightly anxious voice came through: “Who did Li Kai bring!!?”\n\n“You don’t know!!?”\n\n“What were you even doing? With so many people, you couldn’t even protect Jingshen!”\n\nAnger flared, and the woman forcefully slammed her phone down, shattering it.\n\nThe person currently on the phone was Kou Jingshen's eldest sister, Kou Jinglan.\n\nAnd the person in the pool was her husband, Quan Qing of the Swallow Gate.\n\nQuan Qing adjusted his sunglasses: “Wifey, why are you so angry? What happened to Jingshen?”\n\nIt was fine when he didn't speak, but as soon as he did, Kou Jinglan exploded again.\n\n“What happened!? Li Kai brought people and attacked my brother’s company! Not only were the security guards beaten, but my brother was taken away too!!”\n\nShe lowered her head, panting with hands on her hips, then pointed a finger at Quan Qing: “Now, call Li Kai immediately and tell him to release my brother!”\n\n“I can’t even bear to hit my own brother, why does he get to bring people to beat my brother? I’m not done with him over this!!”\n\nThe man's figure flickered, and he flashed to the poolside to pick up his phone: “Alright, alright, calling, calling. I’ll call right away, wifey, calm down.”\n\nAlthough that's what he said.\n\nBut Quan Qing had misgivings in his heart.\n\nLogically speaking, Li Kai isn't someone who acts like this, right?\n\nEven if Kou Jingshen provoked him, no matter how great the offense, he wouldn't bring people to directly apprehend and beat someone...\n\nCould it be that 749 is going to move against the Kou family, so his attitude has changed?\n\nThe more Quan Qing thought about it, the more he felt something was wrong, but he didn't say anything.\n\nHe was merely a live-in son-in-law; his playboy nature attracted Kou Jinglan years ago, which was how he got the opportunity to marry into the Kou family.\n\nKou Jinglan had an overbearing personality, and Quan Qing's marriage was less a choice and more a coercion.\n\nWhat's more, if the higher-ups really intended to move against the Kou family, then he, a live-in son-in-law...\n\nHmm, no, he needed to think of an escape route.\n\nQuan Qing didn't believe the Kou family stood a chance of resisting when 749 was serious.\n\nHe was from the Swallow Gate. How glorious the Swallow Gate used to be, with master thieves emerging frequently. The current Kou family is nothing compared to the Swallow Gate of the past.\n\nThe result? Wasn't it because they were unwilling to change their ways that 749 dealt with them, leaving only a handful of stragglers?\n\nWhile pretending to make a call, Quan Qing sent messages to his company staff, telling them to send over the surveillance footage.\n\nMeanwhile, in the car, Li Kai was driving.\n\nSeeing Quan Qing's incoming call, he turned his head to look at Lu Ding sitting beside him, and Bai Hemian in the back seat, holding one person with each hand.\n\n“It’s Kou Jinglan, the Kou family’s eldest daughter, her husband Quan Qing calling.”\n\n“Tell them we’ll bring the person over right away. Remember to tell her that today, for this person, her father Kou Huaiyi must personally come out and take him.”\n\nLu Ding said, smiling.\n\nBai Hemian in the back seat instantly understood something.\n\nHis eyes lit up.\n\n“Later, I’ll assist in clearing the path?”\n\nLu Ding: “I’ll charge up for the main attack.”\n\nTheir smiles sent a chill down Li Kai's spine.\n\nEspecially the words ‘charge up’.\n\nHe knew about Lu Ding's signature move.\n\nThe call was answered.\n\nLi Kai spoke to Quan Qing on the other end of the line while scanning Lu Ding, who was charging up, with his peripheral vision.\n\nHe saw terrifying residual power faintly emanating from Lu Ding's hand.\n\nAt this moment, Li Kai's heart was trembling.\n\nYou’d better be careful. This charged slash, though small in his hand, if anything goes wrong, its power is greater than a missile in the armory.\n\nIf things go south.\n\nLi Kai estimated that out of the five people in the car, at least three would die.\n\nBefore, he'd only heard about it; now, sitting beside him and experiencing it firsthand, he was truly terrified of those waves of fluctuation.\n\nAnyone sitting here would be scared stiff.\n\nOn this end, as soon as the call ended.\n\nQuan Qing relayed Li Kai's words.\n\nHearing that they were bringing the person home.\n\nKou Jinglan's anger finally subsided a bit.\n\nShe took the opportunity to sit down; now with her feet off the ground, her intelligence once again took the high ground. *\n\nKou Jinglan was heard muttering, analyzing: “They even want Dad to personally come out and collect him. Did Jingshen commit some major offense?”\n\nHer brows furrowed: “No!!!”\n\n“Husband, put your clothes on and come with me to see Dad. At this critical juncture, we can't afford any mistakes.”\n\n“If 749 gets a handle on us, then it won't be easy to negotiate.”\n\nQuan Qing agreed.\n\n“Alright, I’ll go get dressed first.”\n\nHe walked quickly towards the house, his hands sifting through the video files sent from the company.\n\nSeeing that familiar figure.\n\nQuan Qing's eyes widened, and he pressed pause.\n\nWith a look of disbelief, he switched his phone's background app, opened the ‘Swallow Gate’ group chat, and scrolled through the chat history.\n\n“Listen up, everyone. For this period, everyone behave yourselves. That incompetent Uncle of yours, who was mixed up with the Heavenly Principle Cult, is now dead at the hands of a 749 investigator.”\n\n“To prevent you all from causing me trouble, I declare beforehand that for the next six months, I won't go anywhere. I’ll just sit at home, clutching our Swallow Gate roster.”\n\n“If anyone causes trouble, I’ll pick up my pen and directly cross out their name, expelling them from the Swallow Gate.”\n\nBelow it was a photo.\n\nIt was Old Man Qianjin, in a gruesome state of death.\n\nAt the time, when Quan Qing saw this photo, he even looked it up. When he saw that the person who killed his ‘Uncle’ was an intern investigator named Lu Ding.\n\nHe even laughed and quipped.\n\n“Uncle, Uncle, you lived to such an old age and were still killed by an intern investigator. You really are useless.”\n\nThis was the first time.\n\nThen, not long after, the Sect Master sent another message in the group chat, saying.\n\n“Now the branch leader of the Heavenly Principle Cult has been killed by Lu Ding. You all better behave. If you cause trouble outside, tell me early. If you can hide, then hide.”\n\n“If you can't hide, don't run home. I can't protect you.”\n\n“That Heavenly Principle Cult's Liu Xingchuan's cultivation was even higher than mine.”\n\nIt was then that Quan Qing realized how terrifying the growth rate of this youth who killed his uncle was.\n\nAfter that, he intentionally paid attention to Lu Ding, and the more he did, the more alarmed he became.\n\nHe secretly swore to himself that he must stay far away from such a person.\n\nBut now you're telling him that Lu Ding has come charging in!!!\n\n“No, I have to run. Lu Ding is here; 749's attitude is obvious. The Kou family is definitely done for. Lu Ding will charge up, and what if his charged slash hits me?”\n\nHis movements had just sped up, but then he thought again.\n\nNo!\n\n“If I run now, I'm not afraid of the odds, but of the ‘what if.’ What if the Kou family reaches an agreement with 749 again? Wouldn't my running away make me a deserter? Then the Kou family wouldn't let me off either.”\n\n---\n* *With her feet off the ground, her intelligence once again took the high ground*: A humorous idiom suggesting that when one calms down (e.g., by sitting), their thinking becomes clearer.",

    "content": ".....\n\nThinking of this, Quan Qing's eyes turned fierce, and a sinister smile played on his lips.\n\nHe turned to the toilet and found a bundle wrapped in oiled paper.\n\nHe unwrapped it.\n\nInside were various photos of Kou Jinglan's affair. Of course, these weren't the most crucial part.\n\nWhat was crucial was the evidence beneath them that the Kou family was nurturing corpses through graves.\n\nIt was precisely because this item was in the grave that the Kou family dared not move it.\n\nIf it were moved and lost the nourishment of geomantic energy, the things inside would surely explode the nest.\n\nWouldn't everything be exposed then?\n\n\"I have to pin you all down before I can safely make my escape...\"\n\nWhen navigating the world, who doesn't keep a backup plan? He was, after all, an obedient son-in-law, a good biting dog. After all these years, it was perfectly normal for him to have access to some of the Kou family's secrets, right?\n\nGo out and ask around, who in Jinshan didn't know that he, Quan Qing, was a famous cowering turtle and cuckold?¹\n\nEndurance, it was all endurance.\n\nSince it was uncertain whether the Kou family could be destroyed, he would add a definite fire to the situation.\n\nIf it were someone else, Quan Qing wouldn't dare to rashly add this fire. But this time, it was Lu Ding.\n\nWith that temper.\n\nHe hated evil like a personal enemy; demons and monsters could never survive under his hand.\n\nWith such a monster right there, Quan Qing didn't believe he wouldn't kill it!\n\nThat was Lu Ding's reputation!\n\nIf Ling Hai dared to attack a Si Ming, what else wouldn't he dare to do?\n\nQuan Qing changed his clothes, took out his phone, and dialed Li Kai's number again.\n\nThe moment the other side picked up, he laughed heartily: \"Old Sun? I'm busy right now, something happened at home, I have to go see my father-in-law.\"\n\n\"Eh, eh, eh, next time, next time. Oh, by the way, that Intangible Cultural Heritage pastry you bought me last time was really good, from Xicheng Banqiao, yes, yes, yes, okay, okay, okay.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, with the smile still on his face, Quan Qing strode out the door.\n\nIn the car.\n\nLi Kai listened to him babble on, and although he didn't understand what this person wanted to do, his sensitive professional intuition made him subconsciously search for \"Xicheng Banqiao Intangible Cultural Heritage pastry.\"\n\nThe screen changed.\n\nSeveral large characters appeared:\n\n[Handmade Sticky Rice Dumplings, Intangible Cultural Heritage, 400 Years Imperial Tribute, Wisdom of Generations]\n\nLi Kai held up his phone to show Lu Ding.\n\nSeeing these things, Lu Ding immediately understood: \"No wonder the Kou family won't move. Better to stay put than move. Geomantic energy nurturing sticky rice dumplings – that's a professional match.\"\n\nGrave-nurturing corpses via geomancy was not uncommon.\n\nWhat was uncommon was that someone was actually nurturing corpses right under the nose of 749.\n\nAbsorbing half the city's geomantic energy, the thing inside must be a formidable character.\n\nFinally, something worth seeing.\n\nHowever, before killing the monster, they still needed to deal with the Kou family.\n\nTo prevent them from causing trouble during the fight.\n\n\"Why did this Quan Qing suddenly bring this up? Why didn't he say anything before?\"\n\nLi Kai couldn't figure it out.\n\nIf Quan Qing had mentioned this earlier, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian probably wouldn't have even arrived here.\n\nOccupying land, relocating graves, and disrupting geomancy – this could be negotiated.\n\nAfter all, geomantic energy was formed by the forces of heaven and earth, it had nothing to do with you.\n\nIf you buried someone first and then geomantic energy formed, your enjoyment of it was a matter of destiny. If the impact was small, it was your fate.\n\nBut if the actual impact was too great and you were asked to move, it was for the greater good.\n\nHowever, if this was intentional, the definition changed.\n\nLu Ding didn't quite understand either, but it didn't matter. Many things in the world couldn't be fully understood.\n\nAs long as the outcome was right.\n\n.....\n\nThe Kou family.\n\nOutside the ancient-style courtyard, two people hurried over, disturbing the quiet and peaceful atmosphere within.\n\nIn the triangular pavilion.\n\nKou Huaiyi held a book, dressed in a white training uniform, his face ruddy, both temples bulging high, his breathing long and powerful.\n\nHearing footsteps approach, he turned his head to look.\n\nHis gaze met Kou Jinglan's as she emerged from behind the spirit screen.\n\n\"Dad, Jingshen has been arrested!!\"\n\nHearing his daughter's words, Kou Huaiyi put down his book. \"What happened?\"\n\nKou Jinglan recounted the story.\n\nBy the time she finished speaking, Quan Qing nearby bent over and humbly presented his phone, displaying surveillance screenshots of Lu Ding and the others.\n\n\"Dad, I just asked the company staff for surveillance footage. These two aren't old but look unfamiliar. They're not afraid of the Lan family; typical unripe melons.\"\n\n\"When they arrive, you go out first and stall them. I'll immediately go out and investigate their background. Please, Dad, whatever you do, don't make a move first.\"\n\nYou old man, I'm going to step on the gas and go straight to your ancestral grave.\n\nInvestigate?\n\nYou wait. If I were to investigate for you, I'd first talk to fool you, and then I'd have to hide far away, lest I get chopped.\n\nKou Huaiyi looked at his son-in-law.\n\nHe nodded silently in his heart.\n\nNot bad!\n\nAlthough Jinglan forced him to marry her, over the years, he had been diligent, done a lot for the Kou family, working tirelessly and never complaining.\n\nBoth his efficiency and results pleased Kou Huaiyi greatly.\n\nSo, Kou Huaiyi felt that if this matter was left to Quan Qing, given his past efficiency, it would take a few hours at most.\n\nHe wouldn't mind stalling for a bit.\n\nOnce the background of these two youngsters was clear, they could then prescribe the right medicine!\n\n\"Go, be quick.\"\n\n\"Understood, Dad. You wait for my good news.\"\n\nAfter Quan Qing finished speaking, he remained facing Kou Huaiyi and backed out of the courtyard.\n\nAfter he left, Kou Huaiyi said to his daughter, \"Don't think I don't know about your outside affairs. Ah Quan is a good kid, and you chose him yourself, so you must be responsible for your feelings.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, Dad. I was just having some fun. My heart still belongs to Ah Quan.\"\n\n\"He can have fun too, I don't control him.\"\n\nKou Huaiyi snorted at her words: \"Easy for you to say.\"\n\nThe woman didn't care.\n\nShe indeed didn't control Quan Qing, but that was because she knew Quan Qing wouldn't dare.\n\nSo she was fearless.\n\nKou Huaiyi rose: \"Let's go. We'll meet these two rising stars at the gate. I want to see how much capability these two greenhorn kids possess!\"\n\n\"If they dare to lay hands on my son, Kou Huaiyi's son, they'd better have some heaven-shaking background!\"\n\nOtherwise, Kou Huaiyi would definitely teach Lu Ding and Bai Hemian a lesson in the name of a senior.\n\n.....\n\nOutside the Kou family estate.\n\nTwo cars passed each other.\n\nAs the view shifted, Lu Ding peeled back the oiled paper with one hand, and various photos and documents appeared before his eyes.\n\nThese things could almost seal the Kou family's fate directly.\n\nA note was also attached.\n\nHe unfolded it.\n\n[Quan Qing of Swallow Gate. Having long heard of Lu Taisui's formidable reputation, and to thank Lu Taisui for purging the ranks of my Swallow Gate, I hereby specially present a small token gift today. Please, Lu Taisui, investigate thoroughly. All matters concerning the Kou family are unrelated to one son-in-law.]\n\n[Kou Huaiyi is troublesome; the world knows he cultivates both internal and external arts, but few know he possesses a lethal secret technique called \"sword in the belly.\" It injures people with a spoken word. Please, Lu Taisui, be extra careful and remember not to engage him in any conversation, or your intestines will rot and pierce, and the sword will emerge from your mouth.]\n\nGood heavens, he completely exposed Kou Huaiyi's secrets.\n\nHowever, Lu Ding truly hadn't known about this secret technique, \"sword in the belly.\"\n\nInjuring people with a spoken word, falling victim by engaging in conversation.\n\nThis was truly a sinister trick.\n\nLi Kai could also see the contents of the note.\n\nNow he understood why Quan Qing hadn't said anything earlier. It turned out he hadn't felt pressured.\n\nAlthough the note was full of respectful words, upon closer inspection, the emphasis was on only four words: \"unrelated to me.\"\n\nIf Lu Ding hadn't come, he would have just continued living like that; it was actually quite good.\n\nBut with Lu Ding here, it was \"please, whatever you do, don't chop me\" and \"unrelated to me.\"\n\nWith a flick of his hand, the note was instantly shredded by countless tiny slashes.\n\n\"I like dealing with smart people the most.\"\n\nOutside the estate, Li Kai parked the car.\n\nHe had originally intended to go in with Cui Zao, but now it wasn't necessary.\n\nLu Ding instructed Li Kai: \"Captain Li, thank you for waiting for us for a bit.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I'll guard this stinky kid and wait for you.\"\n\nWatching Lu Ding, his hands clasped behind his back, and Bai Hemian, carrying a person, walk into the estate, Li Kai remarked, \"That's truly a comfortable thing to hear.\"\n\nHe knew his place; he certainly wouldn't be able to participate in the upcoming fight, but they were still giving him face.\n\n---\n¹**縮頭王八綠毛龜 (suōtóu wángbā lǜmáo guī)**: A derogatory idiom. \"縮頭王八\" (suōtóu wángbā) literally means \"a turtle that retracts its head,\" referring to a coward. \"綠毛龜\" (lǜmáo guī) literally means \"green-haired tortoise,\" which is slang for a cuckold (a man whose wife is unfaithful), stemming from the Chinese idiom \"戴綠帽子\" (dài lǜ màozi), \"to wear a green hat,\" meaning to be cuckolded.

    "content": "......\n\nEntering the manor, Lu Ding pondered how he could get close to Kou Huaiyi to unleash his slash attack without having to talk to him. After much thought, he then heard a servant of the Kou family announce, “Honored Guests Arrive!!!”\n\nThe doors to the banquet hall opened. Inside, Kou Huaiyi sat upright, with Kou Jinglan beside him, along with Kou Huaiyi’s brothers. Seeing Kou Jingshen spitting blood foam in Bai Hemian’s hands, Kou Jinglan’s anger instantly flared up again. Beside him, Kou Huaiyi crushed the expensive teacup in his hand.\n\nSeeing this scene, Lu Ding thought to himself: Got it!!\n\n“Quite the airs you put on. Since you don’t want your son, then you just stay seated. Don’t you dare get up.”\n\nLu Ding turned and left. Kou Huaiyi, who had originally intended to put them in their place, was completely stunned.\n\nNo. Two juniors, how dare they be so presumptuous!!? He, a Life Realm expert, is seated, and you stand. Isn’t that how it should be? Qi Refiners have always honored the strong since ancient times. This is very reasonable. How can they just leave like that? Kou Huaiyi couldn’t sit still. Seeing Kou Jingshen’s severe injuries, he stood up and leaped over in one stride. His figure closed in. He reached out and said, “Please wait!”\n\nThe sound of wind assailed him. Just as Kou Huaiyi was less than two meters away from Lu Ding, he suddenly turned, raising his palm to meet him. The slash attack, accumulated for a long time, erupted instantly. Lu Ding himself lurched backward. In that instant, it felt as if the world lost its color, all light dimmed, and an indescribable sharpness cut through everything around them. Even with Kou Huaiyi’s cultivation of the Life Realm, he couldn’t withstand this attack. As early as when Lu Ding was in the Spirit Sea Realm, he had used this move to heavily wound Shi Gandang, renowned for his defense, and later used it to fight Ye Chengfeng. Now he was in the Divine Palace Realm. How can an unprepared Life Realm expert block this slash attack that has been charged to its limit?\n\nThe earth split, and flora was completely destroyed. The massive manor was split cleanly in two. That’s right! Lu Ding’s charge this time was a vertical cut. While a horizontal cut has a wide range, it also has great limitations, making it easy to fail to kill with one blow. However, a vertical cut, while not having a large range, can cleave from the top of the head to beneath the crotch, slicing you directly in two.\n\nThe world fell silent. Kou Huaiyi landed steadily, standing less than a meter in front of Lu Ding. He raised a hand to tug at his collar, smoothed his beard, maintaining the demeanor of a strong expert. His spiritual energy no longer surged. He blurted out, “Charged slash attack, I see now. You are Lu Ding of Cloud Sea 749. I didn’t expect you to have reached the Divine Palace Realm. Can you answer me one question?”\n\nLu Ding watched the red line gradually appear from his brow downward. With a smile on his face, he had no intention whatsoever of answering him.\n\nSnap.....crunch......\n\nBlood seeped out. Kou Huaiyi moved his right leg, pulling the right side of his body forward a step, while his left side, lacking support, remained in place, causing him to immediately fall to the ground. He supported his right body with one leg, blood gushing wildly, living flesh pulsating with his breath. He raised a hand: “You.....why didn’t you....answer me......”\n\nLu Ding continued to eye him coldly, thinking to himself: Because your trump cards, I already know them inside out. Seeing the body slowly topple over, Lu Ding raised his leg and lashed out with a whip kick. Half of Kou Huaiyi’s body was sent flying directly into the banquet hall, knocking over the stunned Kou Jinglan.\n\nAs Lu Ding unleashed his aura, dark clouds instantly gathered in the sky, and darkness enveloped the surroundings. Red light flickered within, converging into the outline of a pair of eyes that burst with scattered light.\n\n“The rest of you trash!! Come!!!!”\n\n“Big Brother!!!” Kou Huaiyi’s second brother, Kou Huaishan, cried out in sorrow. Under the surge of his aura, the momentum of his Divine Palace Realm Ninefold stirred. He directly shattered the banquet hall’s ceiling, with a rumbling sound. Spiritual energy gathered.\n\n“You despicable sneak attacker, I’ll have you dead!!!”\n\nKou Huaishan formed a hand seal and turned, his back clothes bursting open, revealing a bizarre tattoo beneath. As spiritual energy surged, it coursed through the lines, and the tattoo was brought to life. Smoke billowed out, spreading. A being like a deity, holding a golden mace, emerged from the white mist. With a swing of the golden mace, the ground cracked. Within, dark aura spread chillingly, and pale white arms clawed forth in groups. Wherever they passed, all muddy ground and everything dragged by them fell into it.\n\nLu Ding flew back to dodge, looking back at Bai Hemian. He saw him toss Kou Jingshen from his hands into the crack in the ground.\n\n“You killed him yourself, you know.”\n\n“Jingshen!!!!” Kou Huaishan cried out in sorrow.\n\nThe next moment, Bai Hemian moved. He was well aware of his role: the small fry were his, the big fish were Lu Ding’s. So, he was now going to bully the weak. Watching him kill other Kou family members, Kou Huaishan roared, “How dare you!!!!” The golden-armored deity, swinging his golden mace, enveloped Bai Hemian with viscous darkness.\n\nAlthough the attack was aimed at Bai Hemian, his peripheral vision never left Lu Ding. Seeing Lu Ding’s figure flash and disappear, Kou Huaishan’s heart instantly surged with murderous intent. You finally fell for it!!! The hand seals in his hand changed.\n\n【Human Skin Calamity】\n\nSplat. The human skin on Kou Huaishan’s back instantly tore open. With blood flowing freely, the golden-armored deity abruptly exploded. Amidst the profusely bleeding scene, a giant flower constructed of human hands slowly bloomed, anticipating Lu Ding’s flashing arrival and wrapping around that position.\n\nKou Huaishan spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, his eyes nearly splitting as he watched Lu Ding about to fall into the human-hand flower. Expectation gradually rose in his heart, but then he saw Lu Ding forming hand seals into a flower, signaling him to look.\n\n“You rejoiced too soon.”\n\nThe next moment, the world fell silent. The surrounding scenery rapidly shifted, transforming from the Kou family’s Prosperity Garden into a sea of ten thousand acres of grass waves, with blue sky, white clouds, gentle breeze, and grassland. Amidst the rolling grass waves, the gentle breeze blew, and clusters of flowers bloomed. Kou Huaishan stood within it. From various parts of his body, flower buds protruded, and intense pain stemmed from his flesh and his soul. The flower buds burst open, under a sky full of flying petals. The ground rumbled, flower trees shot skyward, and petals of various colors gathered to form a flower coffin, wrapping around him.\n\nLu Ding walked step by step through the air, watching the grass waves roll beneath his feet. He observed the flower coffin.\n\n“It’s not about who roars the loudest that makes them awesome.”\n\nHe raised his hand, snapped his fingers, and greeted the sky full of petals that fell like rain.\n\nThump. The flower cluster exploded with a muffled bang, petals flying everywhere, as they drifted down one by one. Time slowed. Lu Ding turned his head, the scene froze, and he saw his profile reflected in each petal. A streak of light passed by. The faces shifted. It was Kou Huaishan’s terrified expression. Scanning over the petals one by one, various emotions appeared on the faces, frozen in each petal: anger, terror, worry, fear, sorrow, serenity..... Finally, inside the flower coffin, his flesh and blood burst into petals inch by inch. The extreme pain nurtured by the flower buds brought a moment of splendor before death. This was the ultimate art.\n\nLu Ding walked alone in the rain of petals. In this art piece, with life as its color and heaven and earth as its canvas, he was a lone artist, performing the elegance of life’s passing.",

    "content": "...\n\nThe surrounding scenery rapidly receded.\n\nHe said calmly, \"From now on, this move should only be used on good-looking people.\"\n\nThe Flower Coffin Death Burial was too beautiful.\n\nUgly people didn't deserve this kind of death.\n\nThese words were heard by Bai Hemian, who was covered in blood.\n\nHe shook the fresh blood off his hands, looked around, and bent down to wipe the glaring color from his hands on a corpse.\n\nA thought flickered in his eyes.\n\nIt seemed he didn't have any very cool techniques...\n\nNor any beautiful ones.\n\nOriginally, he didn't care about such things, but hearing Lu Ding say this now...\n\nHe inexplicably felt it was very... very cool!\n\nDifferent people, different ways to die.\n\nPerhaps this is the difference in taste between me and him. He even considers how good-looking a person is before choosing the appropriate technique to kill them.\n\nUltimately, I still know too little!\n\nI'm still not working hard enough!!!\n\nHe organized his words and said, \"You're still the one who knows how to put on a show.\"\n\nLu Ding was startled for a moment.\n\nThen he laughed heartily: \"Hahahahahaha, screw you.\"\n\nLu Ding then sized him up: \"Look at you, covered in blood. Go wash up quickly.\"\n\nBai Hemian looked down at himself. Indeed.\n\nWhen he had just dealt with the minor enemies, he hadn't paid much attention to his image.\n\nThis didn't seem very good.\n\nIn Lu Ding's words, it wasn't elegant enough. Simply put, it wasn't enough 'show'.\n\nThe commotion inside was huge.\n\nOutside the Kou Family Manor.\n\nLi Kai led his people, quietly waiting for news from Lu Ding. If anything went wrong, he would immediately rush in with his team.\n\nBut now, after waiting and waiting...\n\nThere had been some movement just a moment ago, but now there was no sound at all.\n\n\"Captain? How about we go in? We can't leave Lu Ding and Bai Hemian fighting alone in there!!!\"\n\n\"That's right, Captain. It's not right for us to do this.\"\n\n\"That's a Fate-Commanding Realm expert, Lu Ding and them...\"\n\nAt this point, Li Kai didn't answer, just kept looking at his phone.\n\nHe wanted to go in and help too, didn't he?\n\nBut Lu Ding's charged slash was too powerful.\n\nIf they rushed in recklessly, not only would they be unable to help, they might even become a burden.\n\nWhat he needed to do now was just wait quietly.\n\nFortunately, his expectation was not in vain.\n\nBuzz...\n\n[Lu Ding: Captain Li, thank you for your trouble bringing people in to clear the scene. Also, please gather up any Kou family members who are not involved in this matter.]\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian weren't serial killers.\n\nThey certainly wouldn't touch those not involved in this matter, nor would they touch ordinary people.\n\nQi Refiners and ordinary people are two different worlds.\n\nInvestigators from the 749 Bureau generally don't lay a hand on ordinary people.\n\nAs for why 'generally'...\n\nBecause you can't stop brainless ordinary people from seeking death.\n\nThe moment he saw this message, Li Kai's spirit and energy instantly surged. It was finally their turn to enter.\n\nHe waved his hand grandly: \"Go!\"\n\nA group of investigators scaled walls and roofs, rushing towards the Kou family.\n\nAs soon as they reached the courtyard, they saw Lu Ding holding fish food, feeding the koi in the Kou family's fish pond—fish that were nearly as big as people.\n\nThe scene was quiet and peaceful.\n\nThen they looked to the side.\n\nThe vast, luxurious manor was cut in half down the middle.\n\nBlood was splattered everywhere.\n\nOn the ground, someone was split in two.\n\nAn investigator bent down, leaning to the side, looking at that half-face filled with incomprehension and unwillingness, not understanding why Lu Ding hadn't responded.\n\nThey immediately recognized the identity of the person cut vertically in half.\n\n\"Kou Huaiyi! This is Kou Huaiyi!!\"\n\n\"This... this one too!\"\n\nSomeone pointed to the other half and said.\n\nLu Ding's hand, mid-feeding, paused. He turned around: \"Ah, yes, it's all him. 2.5 on each side.\"¹\n\n\"2.5...\"\n\nA Fate-Commanding Realm expert split in two, dying right before their eyes—this scene was too impactful. Yet, Lu Ding's words had a touch of dark humor.\n\nThey wanted to laugh, but couldn't.\n\nLu Ding spoke again to ease the atmosphere: \"If '2.5' sounds strange, then it's 50% on each side.\"\n\nLi Kai scanned the area: \"Where's Bai Hemian?\"\n\nHe also saw that Kou Huaishan was not there.\n\nCould it be that Bai Hemian went after Kou Huaishan?\n\nHe frowned: \"Did Kou Huaishan escape? I'll immediately notify people to surround and intercept him.\"\n\nFrom the banquet hall, Bai Hemian walked out, shaking his wet hair: \"Intercept whom? And are there still main culprits from the Kou family who haven't died?\"\n\n\"Hey! Why are you here?\"\n\nBai Hemian was a bit confused: \"Where should I be, then?\"\n\n\"What about Kou Huaishan?\"\n\nLu Ding hadn't even answered that question yet.\n\nBai Hemian continued, raising his hand, clenching his fist, then opening it: \"Dead. Blown to pieces everywhere. Died beautifully, just wasn't good-looking.\"\n\nHis words, both direct and implied, conveyed his disdain for people being ugly.\n\nThis was truly something else.\n\nHowever, his words also piqued the curiosity of the other investigators.\n\nDied beautifully?\n\nDeath... could there be such a thing as a beautiful death?\n\n\"Alright, alright, everyone get to work. Send out a message, have other colleagues help keep an eye on Kou family members who are currently out.\"\n\n\"Have them all report to the bureau.\"\n\n\"Notify the scene cleanup crew to come over.\"\n\n\"Oh, and most importantly, notify Kou Jingming.\"\n\nThese things, what belongs to the Kou family belongs to the Kou family.\n\nIt's not illegal gains from others, so the 749 Bureau won't do anything like confiscation. Now that most of the Kou family's decision-makers are dead...\n\nAll these assets, of course, will fall into Kou Jingming's bag.\n\nSeeing that Bai Hemian had also finished washing up, Lu Ding clapped the fish food residue off his hands.\n\n\"Captain Li, please pay close attention to things here. We need to go to the Kou family ancestral grave now.\"\n\nHe hadn't forgotten; there was still a gift waiting for him to unwrap over there.\n\nLu Ding felt a slight anticipation in his heart.\n\nWhat kind of corpse monster would it be?\n\n\"Just leave them here. I'll go with you. That thing has been nurtured for many years. As far as I know, the Kou family established their Feng Shui...\"\n\n\"...at least three hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"The Feng Shui energy of nearly half the city, it might produce a monster comparable to a Fate-Commanding Realm expert. When that happens, it might cause a commotion, and that area has an open view, visible to ordinary people, so we need to prepare.\"\n\nThat makes sense.\n\n\"Then we'll trouble Captain Li.\"\n\n\"No trouble, no trouble at all. It should be us troubling you. This is clearly our responsibility.\"\n\nThe three of them left together.\n\nLi Kai sent out a message.\n\nBefore long, lists for deploying various magical artifacts and materials for dealing with all kinds of corpse monsters were continuously being updated and extended at the Jinshan 749 Bureau's logistics department.\n\nBecause they didn't know exactly what kind of thing was down there.\n\nSo, everything that could restrain corpse monsters had to be prepared thoroughly.\n\nThere were even explosives among them.\n\nBecause some zombies have extremely high magic resistance, at times like these, explosives can produce unexpected results.\n\nOn the way.\n\nLi Kai handed his phone with the list of materials to Bai Hemian and Lu Ding to look at.\n\n\"Do you think there's anything else that needs to be added?\"\n\nLooking at the long lists of various materials and magical artifacts.\n\nLu Ding couldn't help but sigh inwardly, thinking, \"It really is easier to get things done when you're rich and powerful.\"\n\nHe had no suggestions.\n\nBut Bai Hemian had something he didn't understand.\n\nPointing at the phone screen: \"What are these Rain Bombs for?\"\n\nLu Ding explained to him: \"You should also read up more on our bureau's data.\"\n\n\"Zombies, these kinds of things, are countered by things of ultimate Yang and rigidity, and also affected by things of ultimate Yin and flexibility.\"\n\n---\n¹ Lu Ding's statement \"2.5 on each side\" is a piece of dark humor. When someone is cut in half, each side is 0.5 (half). By stating \"2.5,\" Lu Ding is intentionally being absurd and confusing, which adds to the comedic effect of his casual explanation of a horrific death. He later clarifies it as \"50% on each side.\"",

    "content": "「However, for zombies with higher cultivation, this degree of suppression will weaken.」\n\n「Moreover, using something that suppresses it to deal with it will further provoke its ferocity.」\n\n「This is like pouring water into a pot of oil; although it can lower the temperature, it will also cause it to splatter violently.」\n\n「But rain is different. Rain can be compared to adding cold oil to a pot of hot oil—slowly, effectively, and safely lowering the temperature.」\n\n「Rainwater will affect the corpse's perception, making it easier for us to deal with it.」\n\nLu Ding's self-awareness was indeed clear.\n\nHowever, things that required caution still needed to be approached with care.\n\nEven a lion uses its full strength to catch a rabbit, to avoid capsizing in a ditch.*\n\nHundreds of years were enough to create many inexplicable things.\n\nBai Hemian listened attentively, thinking he still read too few books!!\n\nThe three quickly arrived at the location.\n\nKou Family Ancestral Graveyard.\n\nSituated on a fish-mouth point of a backwater bay.\n\nFacing a large body of water.\n\nLu Ding looked left and right, appearing serious and professional.\n\nLi Kai curiously asked, 「What? Lu Ding, you know Feng Shui too?」\n\nThis question instantly played into Lu Ding's hands.\n\nHe humbly replied, 「I know a little.」\n\nBefore, he had relied on this to get an interview at Luo Anping's construction site.\n\nIf his Golden Finger† hadn't activated, Feng Shui would probably be Lu Ding's meal ticket and calling card.\n\nNow that someone was asking, of course he had to show off a bit.\n\nHe pointed to the fish-mouth point protruding from the water and said.\n\n「『Speaking of Feng Shui, wind comes first, water second. Wind brings luck, water brings wealth. If you have luck, you will definitely have wealth, but if you have wealth, you might not have the luck to spend it.』」\n\n「『Wind is the 'dotting the eyes of the dragon,' indispensable. Water is 'adding flowers to brocade,' taking things a step further.』」\n\n「『Wind leaving brings disaster, water flowing away brings misfortune. Therefore, good Feng Shui must have gentle, active wind and smooth, flowing water.』」\n\nBai Hemian listened, dumbfounded.\n\nNo!!\n\nHuh????\n\nHow do you know everything?\n\nWhen did you learn that? How come I never heard you knew Feng Shui?\n\nDamn it, he was lagging behind him again.\n\nLooking at Lu Ding, Bai Hemian sighed in his heart: 『You're still too low-key.』\n\n『After all this time, if it weren't for dealing with the Kou Family's matter, how much longer would you have kept it a secret?』\n\nIndeed, truly cultivated people disdain to casually expose themselves.\n\nGrandma was right, truly powerful people often only reveal their most basic abilities.\n\nBai Hemian pricked up his ears, ready to learn a good lesson.\n\nLi Kai looked in the direction Lu Ding was pointing.\n\nHe noticed that the backwater bay seemed somewhat different from what Lu Ding had described.\n\nBefore he could ask.\n\nLu Ding continued, 「『Are you thinking that a backwater bay collects water at the bottom, and isn't that a bit contradictory?』」\n\nLi Kai nodded.\n\n「『Then let me continue. This formation is called the 'Dragon Nurturing and Coffin Lifting Formation.' In Feng Shui, there are similarities and differences, and the subtleties can be off by a hair's breadth and miss by a thousand li. The exquisiteness of this formation lies in the words 'Dragon Nurturing.'』」\n\n「『A dragon can soar to the heavens, but there's also the saying of a 'fallen dragon.'』」\n\n「『This is within 749's jurisdiction, so the Kou Family would naturally not dare to be a dragon soaring to the heavens. Thus, they could only choose to be a fallen dragon, a 'latent dragon in the abyss,' waiting for the moment to soar.』」\n\n「『The backwater bay, with its water swirling downwards, corresponds to this 'fall' character.』」\n\n「『Look at the surface of the water—it's calm and still, but underneath, hidden currents are surging. This also indirectly proves that while the Kou Family appears law-abiding on the surface, they've been doing a lot of things in secret.』」\n\nSpeaking of this, Lu Ding walked forward, arriving at the location of the Kou Family Ancestral Graveyard.\n\nHe grabbed a handful of dirt, spread it open in his hand.\n\nAs he slightly shifted the angle of his palm, a subtle glimmer of light sparkled within it.\n\n「『Is this fine glass shards?』」\n\n「『Yes, and no. This isn't glass shards, but natural volcanic glass. Based on inferring from the results of corpse-nurturing below, this should be volcanic glass.』」\n\n「『Volcanic glass belongs to Metal. Metal generates Water, guiding water to carry away corpse qi and conceal corpse malevolence. But this is volcanic glass, so it naturally carries fire energy. Metal generates Water, Water overcomes Fire, and Fire overcomes Metal. Fire is the most rigid and most yang.』」\n\n「『It naturally clashes with corpse-type monsters.』」\n\n「『But because this is a rootless fire, combined with the erosion of water vapor, its power cannot harm the corpses below. Instead, it incinerates the corpse qi that the water vapor didn't completely carry away.』」\n\n「『With all these conditions combined, plus the original Dragon Nurturing and Coffin Lifting Formation here, absorbing earth qi, and additionally Fire overcoming Metal generating Earth, four of the five elements have gathered.....』」\n\n「『So there's no Wood?』」 Li Kai picked up the topic.\n\nHe scanned the surroundings but saw no objects containing Wood energy.\n\nThere were many small trees in the area, but they hardly qualified as significant Wood-attribute objects.\n\nBut apart from these small trees, there were no wondrous large trees or anything else.\n\nMoreover, with natural volcanic glass as soil here, it could still grow such lush green grass. This indicated that the vitality of this place was strong, and objects containing Wood energy must exist.\n\nLi Kai and Bai Hemian followed, looking left and right.\n\nLu Ding looked beneath the bay's current.\n\n「『No need to search, Kou Family isn't that foolish. Wood-attribute objects are particularly crucial. If I'm not mistaken, it should be beneath the bay's current.』」\n\nHis words instantly drew both their gazes towards the backwater bay.\n\nLu Ding said as he took off his shoes, socks, and jacket.\n\n「『The objects of the other four attributes can all be found, but only this Wood attribute is missing. It seems this Wood-attribute object must be extraordinary, needing to be hidden. It should be a treasure!』」\n\nWho knew why, but Lu Ding seemed to be naturally at odds with treasures.\n\nHe got a Wind-Calming Pearl, which resulted in him acquiring the Wind-Calming Art.\n\nPreviously, Xie Shunan was going to give him an Evil-Nurturing Gourd, but Ye Feng snatched it and Lu Ding personally smashed it.\n\nLater, he found an Yi Wood Knot.\n\nBut then Chen Xian tried to snatch it again.\n\nFinally, when things were sorted out, the item turned out to be useless to Lu Ding anyway.\n\nNow there was another treasure.\n\nOf course, he was excited.\n\nIt had to be him who went.\n\nThe two beside him were also about to take off their clothes and enter the water when Lu Ding raised a hand to stop them: 「『Don't!!』」\n\n「『Let me do it. Let me also experience what it's like for a protagonist in a novel to find a treasure.』」\n\nLi Kai smiled. This Lu Ding was quite amusing.\n\nHe was hard to describe with words.\n\nWith high EQ and IQ, he occasionally enjoyed acting like a reckless brute.\n\nAfter employing ruthless methods, he would suddenly reveal a childlike nature.\n\n「『Alright, then we'll stand guard for you. You go down and see what's there.』」\n\nBai Hemian silently put his clothes back on: 「『Be careful.』」\n\nLu Ding swung his arms, made a flying leap forward, plunging into the water with a splash, sending water several meters high.\n\nThat's right, Lu Ding did it on purpose.\n\nBai Hemian expressionlessly wiped his face, shaking off river water from his hands.\n\nSpiritual Qi gathered into a card in his hand. He held it up, and writing appeared on it.\n\n【0 points】\n\nBai Hemian slowly said, 「『The splash was too big.』」\n\n「『Hahahahahahahahaha......』」\n\nThis inexplicable humor made Li Kai laugh until he couldn't straighten up.\n\nWhen these two weren't fighting, they were truly a riot.\n\nBeneath the water's surface, hidden currents surged, and tangled waterweeds swayed with the waves. Lu Ding dived down, pushing the water with his hands.\n\nThe deeper he went, the darker the light became.\n\nIn the darkness underwater, a pale smiling face slowly emerged. Its eyes were inverted—pupils white, whites black—and it stared straight at Lu Ding.\n\nBy the time Lu Ding swam in front of it.\n\nThe smiling face bared its teeth, its white teeth and red gums perfectly aligned. Strands of hair spread out like a net in the water, drifting with the current, densely covering the underwater area.\n\nHe heard it speak in human language.\n\n「『Lu Ding~』」\n\n---\n*   **Capsizing in a ditch:** An idiom meaning to fail or make a mistake in a simple or easy situation due to carelessness or overconfidence.\n†   **Golden Finger:** A common trope in Chinese web novels referring to a supernatural cheat or power-up that gives the protagonist an unfair advantage.",

    "content": ".....\n\nThe moment those words were out, Lu Ding's hand moved faster than his brain.\n\nA fist the size of a sandbag shot out directly.\n\nTHUD!!!\n\nIt precisely hit the smiling face.\n\nSensing the terrifying power within, the smiling face panicked.\n\nSeeing its murderous methods were useless and that this person could still resist, the smiling figure floated backward.\n\nBut it had only floated a short distance.\n\nA tearing sensation came from its scalp.\n\nIt turned its head to look.\n\nIt turned out Lu Ding had grabbed its hair.\n\nHe was yanking it back handful by handful, a look of excited delight on his face.\n\nLu Ding: You called me, right?\n\nYou just called me, right?\n\nThe monster shook its head frantically at Lu Ding.\n\nIts posture was just short of kneeling in supplication.\n\nSeeing that begging for mercy was futile, the monster manipulated its hair to attack Lu Ding, but no matter how it attacked, Lu Ding remained completely unharmed.\n\nThe hair that wrapped around him was cut to shreds before it could even entangle him.\n\nUltimately.\n\nThe monster was dragged by its hair by Lu Ding until it was right in front of him.\n\nGripping its scalp, his fists hammered *dudududu* like a jackhammer onto its face.\n\nAs the slashes created bubbles in the water.\n\nThe monster's head floated down.\n\n【Monster Contained: Jiang Chang】¹\n【Containment Reward: Spirit-Shattering Call】²\n\n【Spirit-Shattering Call: Calling a person by their name can cause their soul and spirit to loosen and fall, leading to a momentary daze.】\n\nSure enough, it was this thing.\n\nNo wonder Lu Ding wondered how it knew his name.\n\nPresumably, it had overheard them talking on the shore just now.\n\n【Records in the ancient text *Beimeng Suoyan*³ state:】\n【Along rivers, there are many *chang* ghosts⁴, who often call out people's names; those who respond will surely drown, for they are lured by the souls of the dead. Li Dairen once moored his boat in a winding bay in Zhijiang County. The moonlight was clear and bright when suddenly he saw an old woman and a man...】\n\nThe general meaning is that there are *chang* ghosts in the rivers, who will call out people's names, and if you respond, you're done for.\n\nAs for the rest of the story, Lu Ding couldn't recall it clearly either.\n\nAnyway, it was probably about a person admiring the moon on the river, who saw an old woman and a man emerge from the water and walk on its surface as if it were solid ground.\n\nSome people confuse *jiang chang*⁵ with water ghosts.\n\nBut that's not the case.\n\nTheir distinction is like that between a banana and a plantain.\n\nWater ghosts are spirits that, once you're in the water, will drag you down, find a substitute, and once you die, they can reincarnate.\n\nThe *jiang chang*, on the other hand, is purely malicious; it couldn't live, so it doesn't want anyone else to live either.\n\nIt doesn't even need to wait for you to enter the water; as long as the target is suitable, it can call out to you from a great distance.\n\n\"Oi, you there!\"\n\nThen the person who falls prey to it will be lured over and drown.\n\nWhile it's a bit evil, the spell it provided, 'Spirit-Shattering Call', is quite a useful minor crowd control skill.\n\nConsider Zhang Gui Fang from *Investiture of the Gods*⁶; he had a spell similar to this.\n\nNamed 'Name-Calling Horse-Felling'⁷.\n\nEven King Wu Cheng⁸, Huang Fei Hu, couldn't defeat him; he forced Jiang Zi Ya to hang up the 'No Battle' plaque⁹ and not even leave his gates.\n\nUnfortunately, he eventually encountered Ne Zha¹⁰, who was born from a lotus.\n\nA natural counter.\n\nBut to be defeated by the Great God of the Three Altars and Sea Assembly¹¹ is still something to be proud of.\n\nThough Lu Ding's 'Spirit-Shattering Call' can't compare to 'Name-Calling Horse-Felling', it's more than enough for tricking people.\n\nBesides, Lu Ding isn't Zhang Gui Fang; he knows more than just 'Spirit-Shattering Call'.\n\nHe hadn't even found the treasure yet, but he'd already gained a skill.\n\nLu Ding thought to himself: \"I've already broken even!\"\n\nHe then continued propelling through the water, descending another ten-odd meters, until he finally saw a small tree about a person's height, entirely jade-colored, with four crystal-clear fruits hanging from it,\n\none large and three small.\n\nLu Ding swam around the jade tree.\n\nHe pondered the corresponding information.\n\n\"This should be a Water-Stabilizing Wax Apple.\"¹²\n\nHe had finally found a wild rare natural treasure!¹³\n\nThe Water-Stabilizing Wax Apple, a Wood-attribute water-born rare treasure.\n\nIt has the effects of relaxing muscles and activating meridians, increasing cultivation, and its medicinal properties are gentle and non-irritating, placing it in the upper-medium tier among rare natural treasures.\n\nLu Ding was in dire need of it right now.\n\nHe had just reached the Divine Palace¹⁴ stage, only condensing a phantom; no walls were up, no pillars erected, no tiles laid, let alone carving dragons and phoenixes, or painting talismans and secret techniques.\n\nThere was also the Dragon-Locking Well¹⁵ and Dragon Gate¹⁶ to build.\n\nA mountain of tasks awaited him!!\n\nThe more of these rare natural treasures, the better, and most importantly, he found this himself!\n\nHimself!\n\nIt would taste even sweeter to consume!\n\nAfter picking the fruits, the tree could also be sent to the bureau to exchange for contribution points and be put to secondary use.\n\nAnd there would be more monsters to fight later.\n\nWhat wonderful days these were; Lu Ding had never dared to imagine such a life before.\n\nHe swam to the base of the Water-Stabilizing Wax Apple.\n\nLu Ding wrapped both hands around the tree trunk, which was as thick as an forearm, mobilizing the spiritual qi¹⁷ within his body to combine with his physical strength.\n\nPULL!!!!\n\nRUMBLE!!!\n\nThe seabed shook.\n\nThe previously calm water surface suddenly surged with waves, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and strong winds howled over the hills.\n\nThe Water-Stabilizing Wax Apple, the key lies in the word 'Stabilizing' (定).\n\nWithout it stabilizing the water, the water element within the feng shui would become chaotic.\n\nOnce the water was chaotic, the Five Elements¹⁸ of this place would surely become disordered as well. Water carries corpse qi¹⁹ and also weakens fire qi.\n\nNow with the water qi in disarray and the fire qi unchanged, whatever was beneath the Kou family's ancestral tomb would surely be uncomfortable.\n\nBeneath the water surface.\n\nAs Lu Ding exerted his strength, the shaking at the bottom of the water intensified.\n\nJust as he yanked out the Water-Stabilizing Wax Apple.\n\nWhere the treasure tree had originally been planted, only a dark, gaping hole remained.\n\nTurbid yellow mud gushed out.\n\nA pair of venomous eyes emerged within it.\n\nThis Dragon-Rearing Coffin-Raising Formation²⁰ had been intentionally nurtured by the Kou family for centuries and had long since developed a faint consciousness of its own.\n\nNow with the formation's core broken, hundreds of years of cultivation turned to naught.\n\nIt absolutely hated Lu Ding!\n\n\"ROAR!!!!\"\n\nA roaring bellow exploded.\n\nWater currents swirled, and mud pillars shot out.\n\nBANG!!!!!\n\nAbove the turbulent water surface, a long mud dragon, too wide for three people to embrace, burst forth, pushing Lu Ding straight up into the sky, a hundred meters high.\n\nLi Kai cursed under his breath: \"Damn it!!!\"\n\n\"Such a huge commotion, how many people must have seen it.\"\n\nHe pulled out his phone and made a call: \"Where are they, where are they? Why aren't they here yet? Hurry up and activate the network jammer, don't let anyone take photos and spread them.\"\n\nHigh in the sky.\n\nLu Ding shouldered the treasure tree.\n\nHis right hand was held forward, palm open, to fend off the mud dragon.\n\nHis gaze met that pair of venomous eyes.\n\n\"Staring at me?\"\n\nLu Ding accelerated backward, gathered his qi, lifted his leg, turned, twisted his waist, pushed his hip, and extended his leg, all in one fluid motion.\n\nHis whip kick ripped through the air.\n\nFor this kick, Lu Ding utilized the 'technique' he had learned from Shang Guan Qing: using yielding to overcome rigidity, transforming immense, hard power into insidious resilience.\n\nAs his leg swung through the air, there was a crisp 'CRACK!' sound.\n\nAs if the tip of a long whip, creating an arc, caused a sonic boom.\n\nBANG!!!\n\nUsing his leg as a whip, with one strike, mud splattered everywhere.\n\n\"ROAR!!!\"\n\nThe mud dragon let out a wail, cried out, tilted, and fell from the sky. A hideous wound marred its head, and starting from there, the mud dragon's solid form gradually dissipated.\n\nFinally, it slammed into the ground.\n\nCausing mud to splash, staining green grass and leaves.\n\nOn the ground, qi gathered into a form, appearing like a dragon.\n\nLu Ding's hand flashed, and a purple-skinned gourd appeared. He tilted it slightly, and the dragon vein²¹, drawn by an unseen force, gradually shrank and was sucked into the gourd.\n\nAs the dragon vein was contained.\n\nThree of the Five Elements were gone; only the Metal and Fire elements remained. Without the restraint of the other three elements, their true power began to erupt, fiercely tormenting the 'monster' beneath the ground.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ **Jiang Chang (江倀)**: A specific type of malevolent ghost in Chinese folklore, often associated with rivers, said to lure people to drown.\n² **Spirit-Shattering Call (呼名落魄)**: A fictional supernatural ability in the novel, directly translating to \"Calling Name to Disperse Spirit.\"\n³ ***Beimeng Suoyan* (北夢瑣言)**: An ancient collection of miscellaneous anecdotes and stories from the Tang Dynasty.\n⁴ **chang ghost (倀鬼)**: A ghost said to be the spirit of someone who was killed by a tiger, who then assists the tiger in killing other people.

    "content": "**\"ROAR!!!!!\"**\n\nEarth-shattering roars continuously surged from underground.\n\nBeneath the collapsing mountains and cracking earth, immense fissures stretched endlessly.\n\nMud and sand spewed skyward, and a golden-red color, invisible to ordinary people, continuously burrowed deeper underground.\n\n**\"ROAR!!!!\"**\n\nThe earth cracked more and more violently, as if something within it was about to burst forth.\n\nBut with the sun high in the sky, as sunlight scattered and shone into the fissures, another more pained roar was heard.\n\n**\"ROAR!!!!\"**\n\nThe fissures closed, leaving only a mess on the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, personnel from Jinshan 749 also arrived, and various arrays and formation diagrams began to be set up.\n\nPeople bustled about, various machinery entered the site, blue corrugated iron enclosed the area to block sight, and outer local departments began evacuating the public, announcing to the outside world:\n\nThey're going to blow up the mountain!!\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding was getting dressed.\n\nLi Kai rubbed the small Water-Fixing Wax Apple fruit in his hand, a smile never leaving his face.\n\n\"How can I accept this? I didn't help at all, and you still want to give me one, this......\"\n\nAlthough the small fruit was useful, its medicinal effect was ordinary, not even enough to add icing to the cake for Lu Ding. So, he might as well give one to Li Kai as a convenient favor.\n\nThe remaining small ones, he gave them all to Bai Hemian, keeping one large one for himself.\n\nLu Ding said with a smile, \"There's a share for everyone who sees it, but I can't give you the large one.\"\n\n\"I'm not that thick-skinned.\"\n\nAfter Li Kai finished speaking, his gaze fell upon the Water-Fixing Wax Apple tree. He spoke with some embarrassment: \"Um, Lu Ding, can you sell me this tree? I'll buy it with contribution points, how about three hundred and fifty contribution points?\"\n\nThis price, upon hearing it, Lu Ding was immediately tempted. Handing it over to 749, at most three hundred, it would definitely not reach three hundred and fifty.\n\n\"It's fine, but why would you buy a tree that doesn't bear fruit? Its next fruiting, who knows when that will be.\"\n\nIf it's handed over to 749, the bureau will have specialists to maintain it, but if you buy this thing personally, it's easy to keep it alive, but difficult to make it bear fruit.\n\n\"My wife is pregnant, three months along, it was hard to conceive. She's an ordinary person, and her body isn't very strong.\"\n\n\"Ordinary natural treasures would be too potent for her weak body*, they'd be a great poison to her.\"\n\n\"This Water-Fixing Wax Apple is wood-attributed, water-type; its medicinal power is gentle. It has also fixed fengshui and served as an array core. It's like a well-trained pony, it won't cause trouble.\"\n\n\"I'll take it back and plant it in my yard, to nurture my wife's body.\"\n\nLu Ding heard a subtle implication. Taking a step forward, he pulled his shirt over his head and put it on, then nudged Li Kai: \"Does the child have talent?\"\n\n\"Mhm, it's a girl.\"\n\nLi Kai replied, happiness overflowing on his face.\n\nLu Ding rolled his eyes at him: \"Who asked you that?\"\n\nLooking at his pathetic expression, Lu Ding bent down and picked up the Water-Fixing Wax Apple from the ground: \"Friendship price, three hundred.\"\n\n\"No haggling, alright?\"\n\nOriginally, the bureau's price was also three hundred, and an extra fifty wouldn't make Lu Ding rich; they were colleagues from allied departments. No need for that.\n\nLi Kai took the Water-Fixing Wax Apple tree, feeling its substantial weight in his hands. What friendship was there to speak of between him and Lu Ding? Lu Ding didn't need to give him face; even a Si Ming Realm cultivator had no 'face' in front of him. It was just that Lu Ding knew how to conduct himself.\n\n\"Thanks, Lu Ding. If you ever need my help in Jinshan in the future, just say the word.\"\n\n\"You might not come once in ten or eight years. Stop talking nonsense and transfer the money quickly.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahahahaha......\"\n\nLi Kai laughed. Although this was his first day interacting with Lu Ding, he didn't know why, whether it was talking and doing business, or just standing beside him, there was a unique sense of ease. It felt as if many problems in the world weren't problems at all. Everything became effortless. Very comfortable, an indescribable comfort. Furthermore, it didn't feel rigid, nor was there any sense of distance. It was as if they had truly been friends for a long time.\n\nAs time quickly passed, the staff of Jinshan 749 were rushing their work. They had to complete the enclosure and the arrays that concealed the battle fluctuations in this area before sunset, to completely trap and eliminate whatever was beneath.\n\nAs for why they didn't directly use a large amount of explosives? Corpse aura is extremely harmful. If it were to fall into the water and wasn't handled properly, it's estimated that this entire area would be ruined. Unless absolutely necessary, these things would not be used.\n\nA little past six in the afternoon, Quan Qing was led over by a 749 investigator. From a distance, he called out to Lu Ding's retreating back: \"Lord Lu!\"*\n\nLu Ding turned around. He jogged over, his posture respectful, a smile on his face that didn't seem fake. Indeed, it wasn't fake. Freed from the Kou family's restraints, he was now a qualified playboy again.\n\n\"You're Quan Qing?\"\n\n\"Eh, eh, eh, yes, yes, yes. Quan Qing is honored, Lord Lu, you actually recognize me.\"\n\n\"The person who gave me the information, how could I not recognize you? If you hadn't reminded me, I might have even been injured in that Kou family fight.\"\n\nNo one would have thought that old geezer would practice the Belly Sword technique. Opening his mouth to hurt people, getting hit just by speaking. That's quite insidious.\n\n\"Supporting your work, that's what I should do. I apologize for disturbing your work now, but I have a piece of news.\"\n\n\"Although it might be insignificant for you, Lord Lu, I think it's better if you know about it.\"\n\n\"What news?\" Lu Ding asked.\n\n\"Lan Ya contacted me this afternoon, asking about the Kou family's actual situation. Your side's information blockade is thorough, and there are no public warrants for other Kou family members.\"\n\n\"They're just asking the Kou family members outside to report in, so people on the outside don't really understand the situation yet.\"\n\n\"When Lan Ya asked me, I spoke vaguely for a few sentences, and incidentally managed to extract a few words from her.\"\n\n\"From what she implied, the conflict between her and you was likely reported back to the Lan family by her subordinates.\"\n\n\"They are preparing to send someone to pick her up there. Originally, this matter would have ended here; Lan Ya obstructed official duties, and the Lan family couldn't say anything, but the person coming to pick her up this time will probably have some temper.\"\n\nLu Ding understood. Isn't this just the Lan family sending someone to pick her up, who might stick up for her?\n\nAlright.\n\nFine.\n\nHit her, but didn't hit you, is that it?\n\nJust an easy thing to do.\n\nLu Ding asked, \"So who's coming this time?\"\n\n\"It should be Lan Mingli. He started cultivating at eight years old, is nineteen this year, has Divine Palace cultivation, and is a minorly famous prodigy in the Yunmeng area. He calls Lan Ya 'Little Aunt' and is closest to her.\"\n\n\"Started cultivating at eight, Divine Palace cultivation at nineteen, and this is called a prodigy?\" Lu Ding felt like laughing. The standard for judging a prodigy is really low, huh. Although you can't cultivate much at eight, you build your foundation from a young age, and then start cultivating when your body has slightly matured in your teens. Up until today, even if not eleven years, he's had at least six, right?\n\nAlthough you can't compare him to a cheater like me, others can.\n\nLu Ding turned his head to look at Bai Hemian. \"What's your assessment?\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n*   \"too potent for her weak body\": Literally, \"her weakness cannot withstand nourishment\"; refers to a body that is too fragile or depleted to absorb or benefit from strong tonics, which might instead harm it.\n*   \"Lord Lu\": Literally, \"Lu Taisui.\" Taisui are powerful deities in Chinese folk religion, often associated with powerful or troublesome individuals.

    "content": "Bai Hemian thought for a moment.\n\nHe decided to emulate Lu Ding.\n\nAs soon as he opened his mouth, it was bold remarks.\n\n\"If I could have access to cultivation at eight years old, I'd be even more formidable than his father.\"\n\nPaired with that emotionless, cold face, it was simply perfect.\n\n\"Hahahahahahahahaha.\"\n\nLu Ding laughed heartily.\n\nBeside him, Quan Qing chuckled along: \"Of course, he can't compare to the two of you.\"\n\n\"Actually, when it comes to talent, let alone the two of you, even the trainees at the advanced training facility can't compare to him, after all, most of you began cultivation within a year.\"\n\n\"But he's been immersed in cultivation for a long time, and he has various magical resources supplied by the Lan family. With external training and internal supplements, although his cultivation hasn't advanced much, his strength should not be underestimated.\"\n\n\"Yunmeng has posted a ranking list; he's ranked ninth for those under twenty. He also has a record of battling someone in the Fates realm, but he certainly can't reach your level. He could just barely resist, then bolt when things get tough.\"¹\n\nThese so-called rankings usually had nothing to do with 749 investigators.\n\nBecause most investigators take up the profession late in life, due to age restrictions.\n\nBut their backgrounds are clean.\n\nExceptions like Xue Ning and Zhu Yixuan, their own families were also in decline.\n\nEssentially, they came from impoverished families.\n\nSo their backgrounds were also clean.\n\nOf course, nothing is absolute. There are also prominent families who supported 749 from the start, but Yunmeng was not among them.\n\nLu Ding thought.\n\nThere were two more missions: one for the Ba'ershan Railway Construction, and one for the Minshan City Waterway Diversion.\n\nOne was next to Upwind Mountain, two mountains facing each other, one large and one small. The other was on Yunmeng's border.\n\nIf that's the case, then wouldn't the second destination be decided?\n\nOriginally, he thought that once things were handled here, he'd go take a look at Upwind Mountain, a dangerous place.\n\nWithout a Wind-Calming Pearl, one couldn't go up.\n\nBut he had the Wind-Calming Art.\n\nIsn't that how it's always written in novels?\n\nPlaces like that usually have good stuff.\n\nPerhaps there would be something prepared for the protagonist.\n\nAfter all, our Brother Feifan had analyzed that according to the plot's development, the Wind-Calming Pearl was supposed to end up in Tong Yong's hands.\n\nNow that Tong Yong was gone, wouldn't it be fine for Lu Ding to go take a look?\n\nBut.\n\nNow, a Qi Refiner from Yunmeng had emerged, and he was even on the Talent Ranking.\n\nAs Lu Ding understood it, if one made it onto this list, as long as the conditions were met, if you defeated someone, then the defeated prodigy's family *had* to provide a heavenly material and earthly treasure to the new recipient of the ranking.\n\nThis was also how the Qi Refiner families in Yunmeng motivated their younger generations and fostered a sense of belonging.\n\n\"You were defeated, and your family still has to give a heavenly material and earthly treasure to someone else. See how good your family is to you? You must work hard in the future, okay?\"\n\nSince that was the case, Lu Ding felt that he could also participate.\n\nYunmeng itself said that anyone could go up and challenge, as long as the conditions were met.\n\nAnyway, he still had some days until he turned twenty. When the time came, he'd just raise his ID card and start fighting.\n\nLu Ding currently lacked heavenly materials and earthly treasures for cultivation. He'd sweep them all up from the end to the top, nine heavenly materials and earthly treasures.\n\nHow much money would that save?!\n\nFreeloading, he absolutely had to freeload. Freeloading was the best.²\n\nWhether Upwind Mountain had treasures was Yan Feifan's guess; no one knew for sure. But Yunmeng truly had them!\n\nTherefore, after fighting Lan Mingli first, he would go to Yunmeng.\n\nHaving thought clearly, Lu Ding said to Quan Qing: \"Alright, I understand. It's getting late soon, and we need to start working here. We can talk about anything else later.\"\n\nQuan Qing said \"I'll take my leave first\" and exited the area.\n\nAfter his figure disappeared.\n\nLu Ding then said with a smile in his voice to Li Kai: \"Captain Li, you must remember to tell your subordinates to keep it a secret. Make sure it doesn't get out that it was me who came.\"\n\nLi Kai couldn't quite grasp it at first.\n\nEveryone else tried every trick to spread their name, afraid that others wouldn't know who they were.\n\nBut when it came to Lu Ding...\n\n\"Oh~\"\n\nHe turned his head, surprised, a smile forming at the corner of his mouth. So that was it, he understood!\n\n\"Hehehe, alright, don't worry, it will be absolutely airtight. No one will know it's the two of you.\"\n\nLu Ding's combat record looked exaggerated. If his name were revealed, it's estimated that people would be scared away before he even arrived.\n\nAfter all, no one was a fool; they wouldn't do something like an egg hitting a rock.\n\nAs long as no one deliberately investigated, it would be difficult to connect it to Lu Ding.\n\nSo, Lu Ding was betting that Lan Mingli had the arrogance of a prodigy and wouldn't investigate.\n\nBai Hemian watched from the side, a little anxious.\n\n\"What? What are you talking about? Why can't I understand?\"\n\nLu Ding looked at him: \"Are you twenty yet?\"\n\nBai Hemian nodded, not understanding why: \"Just turned it not long ago.\"\n\n\"Then you're not getting a share this time.\"\n\nLu Ding, intending to tease him, turned and left. Bai Hemian stood rooted to the spot, then turned to look at Li Kai, only to see him hugging a tree, laughing loudly as he walked to the side.\n\nBai Hemian frowned.\n\nAlthough he didn't understand what it meant.\n\nBut it didn't matter.\n\nHe took out his phone and quietly walked aside to call Li Xuanlong.\n\n\"Hello, Teacher Li, can you do me a favor?\"\n\n\"Help me change my age to be the same as Lu Ding's.\"\n\n\"Don't ask why, because I don't know either. He said if I was twenty, I wouldn't get a share, and when I asked him, he wouldn't tell me. I just can't figure it out.\"\n\n\"But I think if I'm the same age as him, then I should have a share.\"\n\n\"Mm, okay, thank you, Teacher Li. You need to be quick. I'm in Jinshan now. Just have someone send me the new ID card when it's ready.\"\n\nShoving his phone into his pocket, Bai Hemian strode towards Lu Ding.\n\nHe looked up slightly.\n\nNow I'll have a share, right?\n\nIf you won't tell me, fine. I'll just change to be the same as you.\n\n.....\n\nThe sun set in the west.\n\nWith the formation arranged, Lu Ding stood next to the large cannon that launched rain-making shells, waiting with expectant eyes.\n\nLi Kai had just told him that he could fire the cannon.\n\nJust kidding, Lu Ding was already so old; of course, he couldn't refuse such a request.\n\nHe could even have fun setting off firecrackers to explode cow dung.\n\nLet alone firing a large cannon.\n\nBai Hemian walked over and stood to the side, arms crossed.\n\nLu Ding half-bent down and looked up at him: \"Xiao Bai, do you want to know what we were just talking about?\"\n\nBai Hemian shook his head: \"No.\"\n\nLu Ding: ??????\"\n\nHey! Are you really that uncurious?\n\nLu Ding now understood the feeling of his past enemies.\n\nHe was about to say something else.\n\nBai Hemian pointed at the rope in his hand: \"I've seen this on TV. Does pulling it make the cannon fire?\"\n\n\"Yes, do you want to play?\"\n\nA trace of anticipation flashed in Bai Hemian's eyes. When he was little, his family was poor. Other children in the village had firecrackers to play with during the New Year, but Bai Hemian's family couldn't afford them.\n\nMoney had to be saved for useful things, at most to improve meals a little.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, he could only watch other families in the village set off fireworks, exploding colors all over the sky.\n\nStaring up at them, bits of debris would even fall into his eyes.\n\nBut even so, Bai Hemian would quietly watch until the end.\n\nLater, when he grew up, he no longer pursued these things, mainly because he had no friends to play with.\n\nSeeing him like this, Lu Ding straightened up and extended his hand: \"Later, we'll each fire one. Here, you go first.\"\n\n---\n¹ \"bolt when things get tough\": An idiom meaning to make a quick escape when a situation becomes dangerous.\n² \"Freeloading was the best\": Here, \"freeloading\" (白嫖) is internet slang meaning to get something for free without paying.",

    "content": "Hearing these words, Bai Heming, who used to be fearless, suddenly became somewhat reserved.\n\n“No, I won't. I don't know how.”\n\n“What's there not to know? Hold the rope, pull it tight, and when they tell you to, just give a hard pull, bang!!”\n\nThe 749 staff next to them echoed: “Yes, it’s very simple.”\n\nMany people are trapped for life by things they couldn't obtain in their youth; Lu Ding was no different, but he dared to seek out the feelings of youth.\n\nBecause men are boys until they die.\n\nSo he could also sense Bai Heming's emotions.\n\nThey're all friends.\n\nSome people just need convincing.\n\nSure enough, after a few words of persuasion, Bai Heming's interest immediately piqued.\n\nHe kept nodding in cooperation with the staff's words.\n\nSuddenly.\n\nSomeone shouted.\n\n“Time's almost up!!!”\n\nLu Ding stepped back.\n\nHe saw Bai Heming with a nervous expression, a demeanor more tense than when he fought Si Ming with Lu Ding.\n\nFollowing the staff's three-two-one countdown.\n\nA loud shout: “Fire!!!”\n\nBai Heming gave the fuse a hard yank.\n\nA 'bang!' was heard.\n\nThe projectile shot out of the barrel and exploded directly into the sky.\n\nNormal rain-inducing projectiles were forearm-thick and launched by an autocannon device.\n\nBut today's was calf-sized, pulled by a fuse.\n\nAll for efficiency.\n\n“My turn, my turn.”\n\nLu Ding ran forward, took the fuse from Bai Heming's hand, loaded the projectile, pulled, bang!\n\nBai Heming: “My turn, my turn.”\n\nThe two of them, one after another, fired over a dozen large rain-inducing projectiles.\n\nThat night, countless people had their underwear blown away by the inexplicable gale and torrential rain.\n\nOn social media, there were photos everywhere of underwear floating in the sky, hanging from tree branches, and printed underwear lying on the ground.\n\nAs the dozen or so large rain-inducing projectiles were fired.\n\nRain clouds gathered in the sky.\n\nThe torrential rain began instantly, and all 749 investigators put on their hooded tactical rain gear.\n\nCombining practicality and appearance.\n\nAbove the hillside.\n\nLu Ding looked down at the Kou family's ancestral tomb, holding up the detonation device in his hand.\n\nHe pressed it.\n\nBang bang bang.....\n\nA series of explosions rang out, disappearing under the cover of the thunder in the sky.\n\nThis amount of explosives wasn't meant to kill what was below.\n\nBut rather to startle it awake and force it out of the ground.\n\nOriginally, Li Kai and the others suggested direct excavation.\n\nBut Lu Ding felt it was inappropriate.\n\nHaven't you seen movies?\n\nOpening a coffin always leads to a coffin-opening curse. We have explosives, why dig it up? Just blow it up!!\n\nSo, with the explosives placed, detonators laid, and the detonator pressed.\n\nCoffin lids mixed with dirt flew through the air.\n\nLuckily the Kou family wasn't here, otherwise Lu Ding would have said something snarky to them.\n\n‘Look, your ancestor is flying in the sky.’\n\nAlong with the explosives going off.\n\nA series of high-pitched roars echoed through the heavens.\n\n“Aargh!!!!”\n\nBang!!!\n\nThe muddy ground exploded, and skeletal remains flew out.\n\nRolling corpse aura emanated in waves.\n\nBut the source wasn't the flying skeletal remains, but rather the owner of the hand pressed onto the muddy ground.\n\nA dark shadow leapt from the grave pit, crushing the earth.\n\nCracks spread outwards. Rainwater poured in.\n\nUnder the lightning and thunder in the sky, its true terrifying form was revealed by the light.\n\nGreen-faced and fanged, its face covered in grooves and wrinkles, mottled.\n\nIts eyes, like lamps, emitted a green glow, and its sparse hair was loosely draped over its head.\n\nThose characteristic green glowing eyes.\n\nAlmost instantly made Lu Ding recognize the origin of this thing.\n\nThe Wunapo Corpse Ghost, one of the Eight Ghosts of the West, a weakened version of the Wunapo Ghost.\n\nAs recorded in the Taiching Golden Palace Jade Splendor Immortal Book.\n\n[Eight Ghosts of the West: First, the Chunsheng Ghost; second, the Wunapo Ghost.....]\n\nThis thing was mentioned there.\n\nLu Ding still remembered that when he read about it before, he was first attracted by the Chunsheng Ghost, and he muttered to himself, wondering if there was a 'bravely rush into ghost'*.\n\nThe Wunapo Ghost was a proper Western-commanded ghost, accompanying deities to deal with evil spirits, slay the unjust, and residing alongside the other seven ghosts in the Position of Taibai.\n\nAs for the Wunapo Corpse Ghost, it originated from a story.\n\nSimply put, when the Wunapo Ghost was fighting alongside a deity, it accidentally got injured, and some of its blood dripped onto a human corpse.\n\nLater, the corpse was taken by a great monk who wanted to use this corpse, contaminated with the Wunapo Ghost's blood, to refine a Dharma Protector, using the earth energy of the three mountains, and through 'using corpse to support corpse, using corpse to nourish corpse'.\n\nFinally, it became this Wunapo Corpse Ghost.\n\nIt can suppress fortune as a Dharma Protector, possessing a Vajra body, strength to uproot mountains, and unlimited spirit.\n\nWho knows where the Kou family got the method for refining the Wunapo Corpse Ghost.\n\nThey created such a terrifying thing.\n\nIts physical body was robust, its recovery extremely strong, and it specialized in combat and fortune suppression.\n\nAlthough powerful, it met Lu Ding.\n\nLu Ding happened to have something that could counter it.\n\n“Activate the formation. I'll go in. You all can't interfere with this thing.”\n\nLi Kai didn't bother with a hesitant posture either.\n\nHolding a walkie-talkie, he shouted: “Activate the formation!”\n\nDozens of Jinshan investigators simultaneously performed hand seals, and the hidden array plates in various locations lit up.\n\nSilken threads wrapped around it, restricting the Wunapo Corpse Ghost's movements, but only for an instant before it tore them apart with a wave of its hand.\n\nAt this point, Li Kai finally understood why Lu Ding said they couldn't handle this thing.\n\nIndeed, they couldn't handle it.\n\nThis formation could bind him like a dead pig if he were put inside.\n\nYet now, it was useless against this monster.\n\nLu Ding flew forward, his hand performing a seal.\n\nHe could have just clapped his hands and summoned anything, but to ensure the maximum output of spiritual energy.\n\nLu Ding still chose to perform hand seals.\n\nInside his body, the Evil Dragon surged through his meridians, causing spiritual energy to ripple.\n\nDark clouds gathered, concealing a faint red hue, and a gentle breeze carried streaks of foul stench.\n\nThe 'Bloody Wind and Rain' arrived simultaneously.\n\nThis was the technique that countered the Wunapo Corpse Ghost. It was famous for its physical body, and the Bloody Wind and Rain technique specialized in dealing with physical bodies, truly embodying 'softness overcoming hardness'.\n\nThe wind agitated the three souls and seven spirits, the rain dissolved flesh and bone.\n\nAs Lu Ding stepped into the formation.\n\nInstantly, the Bloody Wind and Rain arrived.\n\nThe Wunapo Corpse Ghost turned its head to look; this time, it saw clearly, raising its hand and claws for a 'heart-gouging, lung-ripping' attack on Lu Ding, entering through the chest and exiting through the back.\n\nBut the next moment.\n\nLu Ding's physical body dissolved into blood-water.\n\nThe Wunapo Corpse Ghost turned to search, completely unaware that its own body was disintegrating.\n\nLu Ding reappeared amidst the bloody rain in the sky.\n\nHe cursed: “Idiot.”\n\nLu Ding gathered spiritual energy within his body, clenching his hands and raising them high; the rainwater from heaven and earth suddenly paused and converged towards him.\n\nThe Wunapo Corpse Ghost, noticing this situation, looked around, then heard a voice.\n\n“Look up.”\n\nThe monster looked up as a sense of oppression assailed it, and a hundred-meter-sized red blood hammer suddenly smashed down.\n\nBoom!!!!\n\nWith a solid hit, dirt rolled, and shockwaves surged outwards.\n\nThe terrifying power shook the ground, and the mountainside, eroded by the rain, directly collapsed.\n\nLu Ding stood in the sky.\n\nHe watched the Wunapo Corpse Ghost, which seemed to be impaled into the earth like a nail, yet hadn't suffered much damage and was still struggling to get up.\n\nHe muttered: “You’re truly tough.”\n\n‘I hope that after I kill you, you drop some good stuff for me.’\n\nWith other monsters serving as precedents, Lu Ding estimated that as long as he killed this Wunapo Corpse Ghost, his physical body should be strengthened.\n\n“Rise!”\n\nThe bloody rain enveloped the monster, gathering in the sky, dozens of meters above the ground, as dark clouds piled up and the bloody rain poured directly into the red prison.\n\nLu Ding, with one hand, controlled the spherical prison formed by the gathered bloody rain, continuously manipulating the water flow within to scour the monster.\n\nWith his other hand, he performed hand seals, summoning wind to blow into it.\n\nWatching as flesh and blood peeled off the monster's body inch by inch, and its illusory seven spirits continuously shook and flickered.\n\nThen looking at the smile blossoming on Lu Ding's face.\n\nThe Jinshan 749 investigators couldn't help but swallow nervously.\n\n“He... which one of them is the monster?”\n\n“Investigator Lu’s... Investigator Lu’s technique, why is it so sinister?”\n\n“If I'm not mistaken, this should be 'lingchi'**, flesh being peeled away.”\n\n“No, don't overstate 'lingchi'. If I had to choose between Investigator Lu's technique and 'lingchi', I'd definitely choose 'lingchi'. His technique is like bathing in sulfuric acid, and the 'wind' can even agitate souls and spirits.”\n\n“That's not just physical pain; the soul is hurting too.”\n\n“Aargh!!!!”\n\nAs the Wunapo Corpse Ghost's screams rang out in waves.\n\nThe Jinshan investigator who had just spoken pointed with his thumb horizontally: “See that? A corpse monster, that’s a corpse monster without pain receptors, even it can’t stand it. If a human were to suffer this move, they’d probably want to die immediately.”\n\n“By the way, why is Investigator Lu smiling so happily?”\n\nThose below grew doubtful. Looking at the sky, Lu Ding floated beneath the dark clouds, a smile slowly forming on his face. The more the people below watched, the more bizarre and unnerved they became.\n\n[Containment Target: Wunapo Corpse Ghost]\n\n[Containment Reward: Seven Spirits Pumping Heart Technique]\n\n[Seven Spirits Pumping Heart Technique: The seven spirits govern the strength of the physical body.

    "content": "......\n\n【Seven Souls Heart-Pump Art, Activated】\n\n【Drum-Beat Heart-Shake Art, Activated】\n\nThe words appeared and then slowly faded, replaced by new ones.\n\n【Technique: Heart-Pump Flesh-Evil Method】\n\n【Heart-Pump Flesh-Evil Method: Using the heart as a pump, dissolving flesh-evil to follow spiritual energy, flowing through meridians, carrying blood, pumping throughout the body, opening acupoints, expelling qi-evil, turning the body into a weapon.】\n\nCombined with the technique's analysis and effects in his mind.\n\nSimply put, from now on, Lu Ding's heart would be his internal combustion engine.\n\nUsing flesh-evil and spiritual energy as fuel.\n\nFinally, opening acupoints for propulsion.\n\nWhile strengthening his body, a punch thrown would be accompanied by acupoints spewing forth a burst of flesh-evil and spiritual energy.\n\nKilled, sent flying—consider yourself lucky if your physical body is strong.\n\nIf you're unlucky and your physical body isn't strong, he'd be torn apart or exploded directly.\n\nMoreover, the flesh-evil energy of his body was overbearing.\n\nDevastating meridians and polluting spiritual energy were basic effects; even if you could withstand it, you wouldn't recover.\n\nWith a muffled thump, 'Thump!'\n\nHis heart pumped, dissolving flesh-evil throughout his body. Lu Ding felt his physical body instantly strengthen by a degree.\n\nOf course, this technique couldn't grow indefinitely.\n\nBut its limit was a realm far beyond the reach of ordinary Qi Cultivators.\n\nCirculating the flesh-evil and spiritual energy within his body.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand, and as the acupoint at his elbow joint opened, a subtle, muffled hum of air current sounded, 'Om~'.\n\nThat blood-boiling sonic wave carried terrifying power, accumulating in his arm.\n\nLu Ding conservatively estimated that this punch would carry close to a hundred tons of force.\n\nAnd this was just a slight activation.\n\nIf all the acupoints along his spinal 'great dragon' were fully opened, all three hundred and sixty-five acupoints from top to bottom.\n\nForget about charging up; he could tear Kou Huaishan of the Fate Governing Realm apart alive.\n\nAnd he'd be completely unharmed.\n\nCombined with Living Sloughing, Living Birth, he was simply an unkillable perpetual motion machine.\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding was already imagining the scene when Song Chunfeng would see him again at the Advanced Training Ground.\n\nBy then, if he dared to cause trouble, hehe, Lu Ding alone could wipe him out.\n\nThe kind where he'd be crushed from beginning to end.\n\nOnly now, there was a problem.\n\n“This shouldn’t be considered a technique anymore, should it?”\n\nWatching the acupoint on his elbow joint gush forth a dark mixture of flesh-evil and spiritual energy.\n\nLu Ding continued, “From every angle, this looks like flesh and blood technology.”\n\nA heart as an engine, acupoints as exhaust thrusters.\n\nThis was flesh and blood technology!\n\nDescending from the sky.\n\nLi Kai and Bai Hemian walked over, inquiring about the situation.\n\n.,....\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nA private hospital somewhere in Jinshan.\n\nLan Ya lay on the hospital bed, her cheeks heavily swollen. Although her injuries weren't fatal, Lu Ding's slap was truly going to leave a lasting impression on her.\n\nLan Mingli looked at his aunt in her current state.\n\nA surge of anger welled up inside him.\n\n“Aunt, you shouldn’t have come to this place. And Kou Jingshen? You got beaten for him, and he doesn’t even come to see you!!”\n\nLan Ya sighed and said, “The Kou family’s situation is unclear right now. I heard many 749 personnel went to the Kou family ancestral graves today.”\n\n“749 must have made a move against the Kou family.”\n\n“They’re probably all under control now, so they can’t come see me.”\n\nLan Ya’s tone carried a sense of release.\n\nShe had never received harsh lessons from society before, but now she had taken a slap.\n\nShe, on the contrary, felt that Jinshan wasn’t that great either.\n\nKou Jingshen… it seemed she didn’t absolutely need him.\n\nFor him, she had brought tens of billions to Jinshan, but he just went fishing every day.\n\nAnd he fell in love with a fishing girl.\n\nThe people pursuing Lan Ya could line up from Jinshan to the Dahan border, yet he went to flirt with a fishing girl from a rural guesthouse.\n\nJust thinking about it made her find it laughable.\n\nWas she that worthless?\n\nShe had looks, she had background, she had figure, she had upbringing—she had everything.\n\nKou Jingshen… a man who didn’t know a good thing when he saw it.\n\nAlthough subconsciously, Lan Ya thought this way.\n\nBut verbally, she certainly didn’t say so.\n\nShe couldn't swallow her pride.\n\nThus, Lan Mingli listened, growing somewhat angry.\n\n“It’s come to this, and Aunt, you’re still speaking up for him? If Kou Jingshen doesn’t handle this, I will!”\n\n“749, are 749 investigators really that great?!”\n\nAs Lan Mingli stood up, his sleeve was tugged. Lan Ya shook her head, “Forget it, Mingli.”\n\n“749 is already hard to provoke, and we’re not in the right regarding this matter.”\n\nMoreover, she always felt that the person who hit her must have a significant identity.\n\nIt’s better to avoid trouble than seek it. After all, she came from a prominent family.\n\nShe could still understand many things somewhat clearly.\n\nBut at Lan Mingli’s age, he was precisely in his hot-headed youth. It would have been better if she hadn't said those words.\n\nAs soon as she said those words.\n\nHis temper flared even more!\n\n“What’s this about being in the right or not? I’m going to find *him*, not 749. I’m going after him personally. A Qi Cultivator’s matter should be handled with a Qi Cultivator’s method.”\n\n“He hit you, I’ll hit him. A spar. If he dares not accept the challenge, then there’s nothing more to say!”\n\nAn apology wasn't strictly necessary; he represented 749, and there was no precedent for them apologizing. If ‘Lu Ding’ bowed his head, that would be 749 bowing its head.\n\nThis matter was hard to debate.\n\nBut how it was given, was how it would be returned. A spar posed no problem.\n\nLan Mingli shrugged off her tug.\n\n“It’s fine, Aunt, don’t worry. Among Yunmeng’s talents, I rank ninth. He’s just an investigator; I won’t blow things out of proportion.”\n\nHis slightly youthful face beamed with confidence.\n\nThat was confidence in his own strength.\n\nYunmeng wasn't small, and Yunmeng's Qi Cultivators were even more numerous. Among those under twenty, only eight ranked above him.\n\nLan Mingli didn’t believe that just anywhere he went, someone could be stronger than him.\n\nAfter all, Jinshan was just a prefecture-level city.\n\nHe turned and walked away, an unstoppable momentum—eight oxen couldn’t pull him back.\n\nAs he reached the doorway, he turned his head back. “Aunt, don’t worry. When I return triumphantly, I’ll take you back to Yunmeng tomorrow.”\n\nThe young man's smile was like a rainbow after a clear sky.\n\nLan Ya slowly lay back down.\n\n“Please be careful.”\n\nHearing this.\n\nLan Mingli strode out.\n\nIn the rainy night, a luxury car drove through the rain.\n\n.......\n\nTen PM.\n\nOutside Jinshan’s most famous Riverside Seafood Restaurant.\n\nQuan Qing waited for the honored guests to arrive.\n\nOriginally, he had just wanted to try inviting Lu Ding and Bai Hemian for a meal.\n\nHe had already prepared himself for them to refuse.\n\nWho knew that not only did they not refuse, but they also seemed quite enthusiastic.\n\nIn Lu Ding’s words, this trip was a public expense tour.\n\nI do the work, I take the assignments, and I also get to eat.\n\nSoon.\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian, freshly washed and changed into new clothes, arrived.\n\nQuan Qing stepped forward to greet them.\n\n“What a coincidence, Lu Taisui! I just arrived, and so did you. Quickly, quickly, please come in. The private room upstairs, I’ve ordered all the signature dishes.”\n\nWhat is the art of speaking? This is the art of speaking.\n\nLu Ding concluded that this person had definitely not just arrived.\n\nBut his way of speaking was pleasant to hear and didn’t put any psychological pressure on the guests.\n\nHe was a clever man.",

    "content": "Quan Qing led the way inside.\n\nThe two followed.\n\nSomeone quickly walked past from the side, bringing with them a certain smell.\n\nLu Ding's nose twitched. He had smelled this scent before on Liu Xingchuan, the leader of the Jing City Branch of the Heavenly Principle Cult.\n\nHis gaze followed.\n\n\"Heavenly Principle Cult...\"\n\nThe words were not spoken to avoid anyone, and the person, hearing these three words clearly, turned back in a panic, their eyes landing on Lu Ding's face.\n\nJust as he got a clear look.\n\nHis pupils suddenly dilated.\n\n\"Lu...\"\n\nThe \"Lu\" had barely left his lips when Lu Ding teleported, grabbed the man in mid-air, and was about to smash him into the ground.\n\nBut he suddenly felt something was amiss.\n\nHe'd have to pay for the floor!\n\nSo he simply lifted him up and punched him straight in the face.\n\nSeven or eight molars flew out, accompanied by spurting blood.\n\nThe Heavenly Principle Cult man instantly became dazed. Lu Ding carried him to the restroom and tossed him onto the commode.\n\nBai Hemian reached out and slapped him.\n\n*Slap!*\n\n\"Wake up!!\"\n\nThe man opened his eyes, performed an instinctive parry*, raising his hand to shield his face.\n\n\"Ouch...\"\n\nLu Ding bent down, pointing at his own face: \"You know me?\"\n\n\"No...\" He still wanted to argue.\n\nBai Hemian raised his hand and delivered another slap to his face, knocking out a few front teeth.\n\n\"Think carefully.\"\n\nOriginally, given Lu Ding's temperament, he wouldn't waste words with people from the Heavenly Principle Cult.\n\nHe'd just grab them and twist their necks off.\n\nAfter all, the Heavenly Principle Cult was a wicked cult, and anyone from 749 had an obligation to act upon seeing them. Moreover, he had a conflict with them; one of their branch leaders had died by Lu Ding's hand.\n\nThis was no small grudge.\n\nWhen enemies met, they were bound to see red.\n\nBut!!!\n\nAs far as Lu Ding knew, there was no Heavenly Principle Cult branch in Jinshan.\n\nAnd this person even recognized him.\n\nThinking optimistically, this was an accidental encounter; perhaps he was here traveling and happened to recognize him.\n\nBut thinking pessimistically, this motherf***** was here for him.\n\nNot many people knew his whereabouts, and he had only just arrived today.\n\nIf the Heavenly Principle Cult really was here for him, then it meant there was an internal mole within 749.\n\nHow could one feel at ease with a mole lurking nearby?\n\nHe had to find them and twist their neck off.\n\nUnder these various circumstances, this man got to live a little longer.\n\nThe man nodded.\n\n\"I... I know you, I... I've heard your name before.\"\n\n\"So, since Jinshan doesn't have your branch, what are you doing here? Are you here for me?\"\n\n\"Think carefully before you answer. You only get one chance. Since you know me, you should have heard of my methods.\"\n\nThe man's face turned pale with fear.\n\nHis lips trembling, he stammered: \"I... I don't know, the higher-ups gave an order for members from around Jinshan to gather here.\"\n\n\"A-and then I came.\"\n\nDon't know...\n\nJudging by his realm and courage, he was probably just a small fry.\n\n\"So, there are more of your people inside this restaurant?\"\n\nThe man nodded, pointing upstairs: \"Upstairs, in the 'Five Lakes and Four Seas'* private room. My lord is there.\"\n\n\"Who is your lord?\"\n\n\"Heavenly Principle Cult, Slaughter Life, Save Death, Ding Buxiu.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'm satisfied with that answer.\"\n\nThe small fry wouldn't know, but someone with a name and title definitely would.\n\nLu Ding straightened up. The commode the man was sitting on rippled, transforming into a patch of darkness from which a giant snake head burst forth and bit down.\n\nSwallowing the man, it sank back into the darkness.\n\nThis was another use for [Great Serpent Devour]: destroying bodies and eliminating traces.\n\nBai Hemian, phone in hand, spoke from the side.\n\n\"Jinshan 749 says Lan Mingli is at their entrance right now.\"\n\nLu Ding tutted: \"Tell them I'm currently at...\"\n\nAt this point, Lu Ding opened the restroom door, peeked out, and asked Quan Qing: \"What's this place called again?\"\n\n\"Lu Taisui, this place is called Yipinxian,\" the gate-keeping Quan Qing said fawningly.\n\n\"Yipinxian. Tell him to get to Yipinxian quickly; time is tight. I need to finish this fast. Also, inform Li Kai to send some people to clean up the battlefield.\"\n\n\"Just say that people from the Heavenly Principle Cult have crept in, and the battle might be quite brutal later.\"\n\nAs Lu Ding spoke, Bai Hemian typed.\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nAt the entrance of Jinshan 749, Li Kai read the message aloud from his phone.\n\n\"The person you're looking for is at Yipinxian. He wants you to go quickly, as time is tight. I also need to go now. Do you want to come with me?\"\n\nLan Mingli listened, feeling somewhat confused.\n\nWhat was all this?\n\nHe was here to cause him trouble, yet that person wanted him to hurry up.\n\nThis was completely disrespectful!!!\n\nLan Mingli pursed his lips: \"So, Captain Li, did you tell him who I am?\"\n\n\"It's all the same, are you coming or not? If not, I'm going by myself, so hurry up.\"\n\nLi Kai sent messages to staff while jogging to his car.\n\nThis feeling of being disregarded, even scorned, made Lan Mingli clench his fists.\n\nWhat did he mean, *everyone* was *the same*!?\n\nHe exhaled roughly.\n\nIn Yunmeng, he had never received such treatment.\n\nAs long as he was in the Qi Refiner circle.\n\nNo matter where he went, he could attract others' gazes and attention, commanding their respect.\n\nHe'd hear people whispering.\n\n\"'See that? That's Lan Mingli, ninth on the Talent Rankings. People call him 'Yunmeng Blue Flute'.\"\n\nAnd yet, in this little backwater place of yours, you tell me *everyone's the same*!!!\n\nLan Mingli gritted his teeth.\n\n\"I have my own car!!\"\n\n\"Then hurry and follow. I'm in a rush right now.\"\n\n*Vroom!!!*\n\nLi Kai floored the accelerator.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding was very efficient in solving problems, with his arrival, problems also seemed to follow.\n\nJinshan had never seen any Heavenly Principle Cult fiends before.\n\nIt wasn't a complaint, just a murmur.\n\nHe had to hurry, lest something messy and difficult to clean up happened.\n\n...\n\nYipinxian Restaurant.\n\nInside the \"Five Lakes and Four Seas\" private room.\n\nFour men and one woman were chatting happily.\n\nDing Buxiu, looking to be in his early forties, patted the shoulder of the young man next to him.\n\n\"Baoxiang, you've really hit the jackpot this time. Your very first mission after joining the Heavenly Principle Cult is this big.\"\n\n\"Do well, don't tarnish your Uncle Li the Cripple's name.\"\n\nHearing Ding Buxiu say this.\n\nAmong the five, the only woman leaned on the table, propping her head, looking at Li Baoxiang with seductive, silken eyes.\n\n\"Little Bao, how did you end up joining the Heavenly Principle Cult? Why aren't you going *Biebao*** with your uncle? I heard he's been researching the golden toad over at Ba'er Mountain recently?\"\n\nIt was better not to mention his uncle, but as soon as Li the Cripple was brought up.\n\nLi Baoxiang picked up the mini decanter in front of him, downed the white liquor in one gulp, and slammed it back onto the table.\n\n\"With him?\"\n\nThe words stopped there. Li Baoxiang sneered a few times, then couldn't help himself.\n\n\"Always coming from the mountains, going into the forests, sleeping rough, not only does it waste cultivation time, but I haven't seen him share much with me either.\"\n\n\"Besides, he's been famous for so many years, and what's the result? Cao Ying stole his Ganoderma human and horse****, he lost face. Now, which of the older generation *Biebao* people still respects him?\"\n\n\"There's no future with him.\"\n\n\"As for the golden toad at Ba'er Mountain, he couldn't get it, so he went north to find *Qianyang Ren***** to partner up.\"\n\nSo, this Li Baoxiang was indeed Li the Cripple's biological nephew.\n\n---\n*   **Instinctive parry:** (振刀 - Zhendao) A quick, reactive defensive maneuver often found in martial arts or combat, akin to a parry or counter-vibration.\n*   **Five Lakes and Four Seas:** (五湖四海 - Wuhu Sihai) A common Chinese idiom referring to all corners of the world; often used as a name for restaurants or private rooms, implying a gathering place for people from all over.\n*   **Biebao:** (憋寶) A unique method of treasure hunting or retrieval in this world, involving specific techniques or knowledge.\n*   **Ganoderma human and horse:** (芝人芝馬 - Zhī Rén Zhī Mǎ) Rare and mythical treasures in the form of human and horse figures made of Ganoderma lucidum (reishi mushroom), believed to possess extraordinary properties.\n*   **Qianyang Ren:** (牽羊人) A specific profession or group in this world, literally \"sheep herder\" or \"sheep tracker,\" likely related to tracking, guiding, or assisting in treasure hunting expeditions.",

    "content": ".....\n\nAnd this Li the Lame, had previously competed with Cao Ying for the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse.\nLast time, Li the Lame lost to Cao Ying.\nHe lost both substance and face.\n\nFrom then on, Li Baoxiang no longer had any aspirations for the Treasure Collector profession.\nIt was just okay, he thought.\nDidn't you see Cao Ying, after seizing the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse, had to offer them to Lu Ding in exchange for a position as the head of Cao Family Alley?\n\nAt this point, Li Baoxiang had an epiphany.\nBeing a Treasure Collector was not as good as joining a faction. Although he couldn't join 749, other factions, however, were an option.\n\nThat Lu Ding was born of flesh and blood, yet he carved out a name for himself as the Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke. He, Li Baoxiang, wasn't sprung from a rock. If Lu Ding could do it, then he... after drinking some booze, should be able to as well.\n\nAfter that, Li Baoxiang, using the name of Li the Lame, joined the Heavenly Principle Sect.\n\nDing Buxiu, playing coy, said: \"Then do you know who the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse ultimately fell into the hands of?\"\nTo his surprise, Li Baoxiang already knew about it: \"Isn't it Lu Ding?\"\nHe cast a sidelong glance: \"Once I rise, people like Cao Ying are completely unworthy of mention. But Lu Ding, now he's worth taking a look at.\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, good, well said! Lu Ding can have the title of Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke. From now on, you, Li Baoxiang, shall be called the Instant Grand Duke!\"\nDing Buxiu praised Li Baoxiang loudly.\nIt made Li Baoxiang almost believe he could have such a future.\nIf he hadn't gotten drunk enough, he would have truly believed it.\nHow can you take bragging seriously?\nHe quickly changed the subject.\n\n\"Uncle Ding, so what exactly is our mission here this time?\"\n\nHearing this, Ding Buxiu glanced at the empty seat, not answering Li Baoxiang's question, but frowned and said: \"Where's Xiaoshan? Why hasn't he returned yet?\"\n\nJust as he finished speaking.\nThe private room door burst open.\nA voice preceded the arrival: \"He probably won't be coming back.\"\n\n\"You've been yapping on for half the day, and haven't said a single thing I wanted to hear. I finally gathered some patience to wait for your nonsense, and you actually just spouted a whole lot of it.\"\n\nLu Ding arrived afterward.\nAs he walked in, several gazes fell upon him.\nAll five people's expressions changed instantly.\nLu Ding!!!\nHow could he be here?\nIt's ruined!!!\n\nLi Baoxiang, even more so, instantly felt like crying his heart out.\nIt's over!\nHe'd been bragging right in front of the main guy! If he ever got another chance, he absolutely couldn't touch alcohol again!\n\n\"Run!!!\"\nDing Buxiu shouted, and four figures intended to leap and smash through the window.\nBut before they could move, deep slash marks appeared on the room's walls.\nAs cracking sounds reverberated, tables, chairs, and even the decorative furnishings shattered into pieces. Three of the people collapsed, scattering into three piles of shredded flesh.\nLi Baoxiang, completely unharmed, looked at the tragic scene before him and finally understood that the title 'Grand Duke' was not something just anyone was qualified to bear.\n\nSeeing Lu Ding walk over, Ding Buxiu's miserable cries still echoed in his ears.\n\"My leg!!! My leg!!!!\"\n\nLi Baoxiang stammered: \"Lu... Lu... Grand Duke... I was just bragging, could you please not take it to heart?\"\n\nSmack!!!\nLu Ding raised a hand and slapped Li Baoxiang, sending him flying into a pile of shredded flesh. His legs twitched a few times in fear, smearing blood all over the floor.\n\n\"It's not your turn yet. Shut your mouth first.\"\n\nAlthough Ding Buxiu hadn't said anything useful just now, this Li Baoxiang, however, had said some things Lu Ding hadn't anticipated.\nHe hadn't expected that Li the Lame was also eyeing Ba Ershan, and had even hired a Goat Herder.\nOf course, these were questions for later. Currently, Lu Ding had to deal with Ding Buxiu.\n\nHe squatted down: \"Shut up.\"\nThe miserable cries stopped abruptly.\nDing Buxiu pressed on his broken leg's wound, his body trembling slightly from the pain.\n\nHe glanced at Lu Ding, then lowered his head. Although he didn't know what he was planning, Lu Ding warned him first.\n\"Don't do anything stupid. You can't kill me, but you'll anger me, and if you do, I'll slowly dismember you. If you cooperate honestly with my questions and tell me what I want to hear, then I'll give you a quick end. No one needs to make things difficult for anyone. A good death and a good life are the greatest pursuits in life, don't you think?\"\n\nDing Buxiu gave a bitter laugh, dragging his body backward to lean against the wall.\nLu Ding took out a cigarette, lit it, and brought it to his mouth.\n\nDing Buxiu, whose nickname was 'Killing to Save Lives, Disregarding Merit, Not Discussing Good or Evil,' killed many, but also saved many. He lived life completely by whim.\nNow, with Lu Ding offering him a cigarette, Ding Buxiu took a deep drag, coughed twice, and exhaled white smoke that drifted away.\nHe gave a thumbs-up: \"Grand Duke Lu, you're a man of your word!\"\n\n\"Ask whatever you want. I only ask that afterward, you give me a graceful end.\"\n\nLu Ding nodded: \"Alright. Then tell me, why did you come to Jinshan?\"\n\nDing Buxiu took another puff: \"Orders came from above, saying you arrived in Jinshan today. Although Liu Xingchuan didn't meet his quota this year, he is, in the end, a member of the Heavenly Principle Sect, and a branch leader at that. He represents the Heavenly Principle Sect's face. Liu Xingchuan was meant to die, but he had to die under the Heavenly Principle Sect's rules. Your killing of Liu Xingchuan was like slapping the Heavenly Principle Sect across the face. Cough, cough, cough, cough, and it was the kind of slap that made a resounding sound! The Heavenly Principle Sect isn't small. If we lose face, we have to pick it up, otherwise, what will outsiders think of us? So the higher-ups notified us to come and besiege you.\"\n\nSo they really came for him.\nWell, then.\nIt seems there are bad people within 749.\nSo who could it be?\nLu Ding couldn't immediately think of anyone highly probable.\nThe only one with a slight suspicion was Song Chunfeng. After all, they had bad blood between them.\nBut it was hard to say for sure. After all, so many people at the training ground knew he had come out.\n\n\"Then do you know who spread the news of my coming to Jinshan?\"\n\nDing Buxiu shook his head: \"At my rank, I can't access that level. But this time, the Sect sent a Fire Pillar. He should know. We're scheduled to meet at twelve o'clock at Boulder Dam.\"\n\nThe Fire Pillar, of the Heavenly Principle Sect, is one of the Three Poles and Nine Pillars. The Heavenly Principle Sect worships the sun and believes in the concept of the Three Poles, holding that all things in the world have a past, present, and future. The past is called Wuji, the present is called Taiji, and the future is called Huangji. These Three Poles stand in a tripod formation; they are the three Vice-Leaders of the Heavenly Principle Sect. And these Nine Pillars are the collective term for the three Qi Refiners under each of the three Vice-Leaders. The Fire Pillar who came this time was a subordinate of Wuji.\n\nLu Ding was somewhat speechless: \"This is just like a quest, one nested within another. You really know how to play, huh?\"\n\nDing Buxiu smiled, grimacing as it pulled at his wound.\nAfter taking his last puff, he unbuttoned his collar, gesturing at his neck: \"Grand Duke Lu, come right here. A dignified death won't spray everywhere. Be careful not to chop crooked, alright?\"\n\n\"Alright, my hand is steady.\"\nAs Lu Ding finished speaking, he raised his hand and struck with a slash.\nDing Buxiu's head tilted, about to roll to the ground.\nLu Ding held it, placing it back securely on his neck.\n\"You're honest, and I'm a man of my word. I said I'd give you a dignified end, and I will. If fate permits in the next life, we'll cooperate again.\"",

    "content": "Getting up, he looked at Li Baoxiang, whose face was filled with unease.\n\n\"Alright, it's your turn now. Tell me about your uncle.\"\n\nLi Baoxiang opened his mouth, revealing a mouthful of sticky blood. He mumbled indistinctly, \"Lord Lu Taisui, what would you like to know?\"\n\nHe had just witnessed the entire process. He also saw that Lu Ding was truly a man of principle. He could even fulfill the demands of someone like Ding Buxiu. He hadn't done anything particularly bad himself. If he cooperated honestly, maybe he would be handed over to the Jinshan 749 Tribunal? Prison was always better than immediate execution, right? If that were possible, Li Baoxiang would really kowtow to Lu Ding right away.\n\nBut he didn't dare make demands first. He hadn't even cooperated yet; making demands first, wasn't that rushing to his death? Just now, he had drunk some forced alcohol and wasn't clear-headed; now he was sober. He could make rational judgments like a normal person.\n\n\"Just tell me about your uncle's interest in the Golden Toad of Mount Ba'er.\"\n\nMount Ba'er was a place Lu Ding also had to go. This was his mission. He couldn't let others mess things up.\n\nLi Baoxiang organized his thoughts: \"Previously, my uncle lost face over the Lingzhi Human, Lingzhi Horse matter. When he was fighting with Cao Ying for it, he was again ambushed by him...\" As he spoke, he glanced at Lu Ding and rephrased: \"Due to a moment of inattention, he was struck by a blow from him. Not only did it leave a new injury, but it also agitated an old one. While chasing Cao Ying, he inadvertently saw that Mount Ba'er had the 'Golden Rooster Standing Alone' formation, and secretly kept it in mind. Later, after talks with Liu Xingchuan of the Heavenly Principle Sect broke down, my uncle specifically took people to look for it. They didn't find the Golden Rooster, but they found its egg. However, that egg was taken away by a Golden Toad's egg-hatching feng shui formation, and then, it was startled by the mountain blasting for road construction. My uncle was injured, so forcing it definitely wouldn't work. But when it comes to subtle techniques, he's not particularly skilled. So some time ago, he contacted the Sheep Herders from the north, named Changhai, yes, yes, Changhai, but I forgot his surname.\"\n\nChanghai...\n\nLu Ding fell silent for a moment. There were probably quite a few people named Changhai in the north, and none of them would be young.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"Southern Treasure Hoarders, Northern Sheep Herders.\" In fact, they're quite similar; they do the same work, using Qimen Dunjia techniques to seek out rare treasures and natural wonders. But in some aspects, the two groups are a bit different. Treasure Hoarders are numerous and operate boldly and unrestrainedly. Sheep Herders are few, emphasizing the principle of mutual generation and mutual overcoming among all things. For example, the older generation's bee-harvesting technique. That is a simple magical technique of the Sheep Herders. They use a small piece of meat on a pole to attract hornets, and when it's eating the meat, they attach a tiny goose feather to it. Then they watch this hornet fly and fly and fly, flying back to its nest, where the queen bee slaps it across the face, saying, \"You're the one who brought people here!?\" At this point, the bee-harvester goes up and performs an execution of the entire family. The small ones are deep-fried, the large ones are steeped in wine.\n\nReturning to the present. The startled Golden Toad definitely couldn't be dealt with by force; that thing can burrow through earth, so they could only trick and deceive it. Lu Ding didn't know this point. But it didn't matter, it wasn't too late to know now.\n\nThat Li the Cripple helped Liu Xingchuan with his affairs, and now he dares to come and snatch his treasure! This was tantamount to directly challenging him! Simply lawless!\n\n\"When do they plan to make their move?\"\n\nLi Baoxiang tentatively said, \"Sh-should I... call... and ask?\"\n\nLu Ding smiled, patting his shoulder: \"Oh~ you're still a clever lad, not bad at all.\"\n\nHearing his hometown dialect, Li Baoxiang's face broke into a smile. Immediately, his hand movements became much faster. He quickly and efficiently called Li the Cripple. Soon after, the call was answered. Li Baoxiang bellowed, \"Uncle, you mentioned getting the golden egg last time, when are you going? Save me an eggshell when you do!\"\n\n\"What are you panicking about!?\"\n\n\"I'm anxious too! Changhai said he'll come after he harvests the corn, that's still more than half a month away. You don't put in any effort, yet you want an eggshell? You want an egg!\"\n\nJust as he finished speaking. A woman on the other end shrieked noisily, \"I can't live! I can't live! You want everything? Can't you afford to live? Your mom's dead, your dad's dead, you eat our food, live in our house, and you still want this and that...\"\n\nLi Baoxiang's face became somewhat awkward. \"Aren't the properties my parents left behind all in your hands?!!\"\n\n\"You dare yell at me!?\"\n\nHearing these four words, Li Baoxiang immediately hung up the phone. He looked up: \"Lord Lu Taisui, why don't you just kill me?\" With that, Li Baoxiang imitated Ding Buxiu, pulling open his collar and gesturing to the spot. \"You can aim for here on me too. If possible, please also help hold my head so it doesn't roll around everywhere; it wouldn't look good.\"\n\nLu Ding: ........\n\nHe was truly speechless. At the brink of life and death, how could he still encounter such family squabbles, a \"you're right, I'm wrong\" situation. Seeing Lu Ding say nothing, his expression grew dejected. \"If it's not possible, then never mind.\"\n\nIt was then that Bai Hemian, guarding the door, poked his head in: \"Captain Li and the others have arrived.\"\n\nLu Ding got up and lightly pushed Li Baoxiang's head. \"Get out of here. Have you killed anyone?\"\n\nLi Baoxiang nodded: \"I've killed a few treasure-robbers while running around in the mountains.\"\n\nThat was understandable. \"When you get to 749, reform yourself well. Don't join just any cult in the future; the water is too deep in there, you won't be able to handle it.\"\n\nIn the corridor outside. Lan Mingli, brimming with imposing aura, and Li Kai walked side by side. Seeing Bai Hemian. Lan Mingli almost instantly recognized that this was the accomplice next to the person who had hit his aunt. He quickly walked past Li Kai and scanned Bai Hemian: \"Where is he?\"\n\nBai Hemian immediately frowned: \"I don't like your tone. You'll get hit a second time shortly.\"\n\nHearing these arrogant words, Lan Mingli's retort caught in his throat. Lu Ding shouted from inside the room: \"Come inside to fight; there are too many people outside, and I'm in a hurry.\"\n\nLan Mingli raised a finger, pointing at Bai Hemian, and slowly walked in: \"I'll deal with him first, then you!\"\n\nBai Hemian silently thought to himself: Grandma said it's wrong to point fingers at people, it's impolite. I'll break it for you shortly.\n\nAs the private room door was pushed open. A nauseating smell of blood assaulted them. Witnessing the horrific scene inside, Lan Mingli's face changed, and his Adam's apple twitched slightly. He was born into a Qi Cultivator family, and it was peacetime, and he himself was not yet twenty. When had he ever seen such a full-on graphic scene? His gaze quickly swept to the side, moving away from the piles on the ground, fearing he might vomit. But then he saw it.\n\n\"Slaying Life to Save Death, Ding Buxiu?!\"\n\nSeeing Ding Buxiu's neck with a red line oozing blood, his face pale, and no breath coming in or out. And then seeing Lu Ding, perfectly clean, wiping his hands with a wet wipe. He was somewhat displeased: \"You're cleaning up a scene. Why did you call me over? Is this a place for a duel!?\"\n\nLu Ding ignored him, raised his hand and flicked a white card, which embedded deep into the doorframe at the same height as Lan Mingli's vision. A red line gradually appeared on Lan Mingli's cheek. Feeling a sharp pain, he subconsciously wiped it, and there was blood on his hand. Looking again at the thing on the doorframe, what card, that was an ID card. It clearly stated that Lu Ding was still some time away from twenty years old.\n\n\"I know what you're here for, so you don't need to say much. I'll count to three, so get ready.\"",

    "content": "Lan Mingli's face instantly grew grim, and it was only then that he belatedly noticed.\n\nThis person was called Lu Ding!\n\nAlthough he was a Qi Cultivator from Yunmeng.\n\nHe had still heard the four characters, \"Corpse Dissection Tai Sui\".\n\nSouthern Yunhai, Demon City, Qing Province, Three Districts Recommended.\n\nBut besides these, he didn't know the other deeds of Lu Ding in much detail.\n\nBut this was enough.\n\nCoupled with the tragic state of the room, Lan Mingli's heart instantly sank to rock bottom.\n\n\"Three!\"\n\nHearing Lu Ding count to three.\n\nHis thoughts raced.\n\nNo way!!\n\nHis aura was building up; I have to strike first. If he gets the first move and seizes the initiative, I'll definitely lose!\n\nFrom Lan Mingli's perspective, he saw the changes brought by Lu Ding's rising aura.\n\nHis entire being had a faint semblance of a dragon transformation.\n\nChaotic eyes appeared in his gaze, black mist surged behind him, and an oppressive feeling swept over like an impending storm, a force no human could withstand.\n\nLan Mingli raised his hand and drew the jade flute from behind him.\n\nInfused with Qi.\n\nHe didn't want to say anything else; now that they'd met.\n\n\"Then let me truly witness your methods, Lu Ding!\"\n\nThe jade flute thrust forth.\n\nA blinding blue light.\n\n*Thud.*\n\nLan Mingli's face stiffened, as he saw Lu Ding raise his hand and firmly grasp the jade flute he had thrust forward, with such strength that the flute couldn't advance an inch.\n\nHe knew he might have some gap with Lu Ding.\n\nBut he hadn't expected the gap to be this enormous.\n\nAlarm bells blared in his heart.\n\nWasn't it said his combat power was only comparable to a Siming whose vital energy was depleted!!?\n\nHow could this be!!\n\n\"Witness my methods?\"\n\n\"That could get people killed.....\"\n\nLu Ding said, pulling on the jade flute to drag the person closer.\n\nThen he turned and swung his leg, with such speed that it was in an instant.\n\nBefore the leg arrived, the wind did.\n\nAs Lan Mingli's hair flew wildly, his entire body shot backward like a cannonball, folding in mid-air.\n\nHis legs went up, hands down, lower back arching outward.\n\nIntense pain struck, and consciousness momentarily flickered in his mind.\n\n*'Is this Lu Ding?'*\n\nWith a *thump*.\n\nHe smashed through the corridor's outer wall, flew out of the restaurant, and landed unconscious in the pile of garbage in the restaurant's backyard.\n\nNo matter how the world developed, when it came to conflict, it always came down to the same core principles: speed, accuracy, ruthlessness, and overcoming all methods with sheer force.\n\nIn other words, fighting a Shen Gong didn't even warrant Lu Ding casting a spell.\n\n\"Tsk......\"\n\nLu Ding tsked.\n\nAfter all that, he still had to pay.\n\nHe glanced at Captain Li, who had his arms crossed.\n\nHe instantly understood: \"Alright, no problem, this wall's on me. I'll give the boss an IOU later.\"\n\nWhile the two were talking, Bai Hemian swept out through the large hole in the wall and dragged Lan Mingli back.\n\nHe took a medicine bottle from his pocket, poured a pill into him, then raised his hand and slapped him twice in the face.\n\n\"Hoo~~~~\"\n\nLan Mingli took a deep breath and woke up, coughing repeatedly.\n\nLi Kai also went up at this time, handing the item in his hand to Bai Hemian.\n\n\"Yunhai sent this urgently. You guys really know how to have fun.\"\n\nLu Ding:........\n\nBai Hemian took the ID card and waved it in front of Lan Mingli's eyes.\n\nHe grabbed one of his fingers.\n\n*Crack*.\n\nLan Mingli groaned in pain, looking up at him.\n\nBai Hemian said expressionlessly, \"Grandma said it's rude to point at people with your finger. This time I broke it for you, next time don't point at people casually.\"\n\nPerhaps he felt this was a bit too demanding.\n\nAfter all, bad habits were hard to change; even with Wen Ruchu wearing a mask, he would still occasionally nag.\n\nBai Hemian amended, \"Don't point at me.\"\n\n\"Come on, get up.\"\n\nAlthough Lan Mingli didn't know what he wanted to do.\n\nHe still subconsciously shook his head.\n\nBai Hemian frowned: \"Not getting up?\"\n\nHe glanced at Lu Ding, then said to Lan Mingli, \"I'll also give you three counts.\"\n\nHearing this, Lan Mingli scrambled up and turned to run.\n\nCan't he just not play anymore!!!!\n\nThis was too much bullying.\n\nWhy did he have to be beaten a second time?\n\n\"Running?\"\n\n\"Running also counts as time.\"\n\nBai Hemian chased after him and proceeded to give him a good beating.\n\nLan Mingli's eyes were red from the beating.\n\nOf course, this wasn't a lethal blow; Bai Hemian had held back. He was purely beaten so unfairly that he couldn't hold back his emotions.\n\nLu Ding walked over.\n\n\"According to your side's saying, if we defeat someone on your talent list, you have to give us each a heavenly material and earthly treasure.\"\n\nLan Mingli blinked, trying to suppress his emotions.\n\nHe looked at Lu Ding and Bai Hemian, then said only one word: \"Fine!\"\n\nLu Ding smiled, and Bai Hemian beside him suddenly understood.\n\nHe looked down at Lan Mingli: \"Do you really have such a rule over there? I want a Wind Roar Stone.\"\n\n\"Is this something you can choose!!?\"\n\nLan Mingli could no longer hold it in, his voice tinged with a sob.\n\nBai Hemian paused.\n\n\"You dare to yell at me?\"\n\nHe rolled up his sleeves and quickly approached. Lan Mingli kicked back, scrambled up, and ran.\n\nHe wiped his arm across his face, shouting loudly as he ran, \"Give! I'll give it to you!!!!\"\n\n\"Don't chase me!!!\"\n\nLu Ding quickly called out to him: \"Remember to spread the word for us, we'll be going to Yunmeng in a few days.\"\n\nHearing this, Lan Mingli stumbled.\n\nTwo inhumane bastards!\n\nThen he quickly vanished into the night.\n\n\"You made him cry, you two are truly heartless.\"\n\nLi Kai said from the side.\n\nLu Ding couldn't hold back.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, I didn't expect him to cry either. Blame Bai Hemian.\"\n\nBai Hemian nodded: \"Too fragile, a hothouse flower. I don't cry. Grandma told me a real man sheds blood, not tears.\"\n\nLi Kai: ......\n\nOne is flawless.\n\nThe other is purely single-minded.\n\nHe didn't know how these two ended up teamed up.\n\nYou couldn't talk sense into either of them, because you couldn't keep up with their thought processes.\n\nHe turned his head and gestured towards the room: \"What did you find out just now? And how are you planning to deal with the person inside?\"\n\n\"The living one should be sentenced. If you do something wrong, you admit it. Just follow the normal procedures; the crime isn't severe.\"\n\n\"As for just now.......\"\n\n\"Old Li, want a political achievement?\"\n\nWith Lu Ding's words, if they followed the procedures, Li Baoxiang wouldn't be imprisoned for long.\n\nLi Kai's face instantly broke into a smile upon hearing \"political achievement\": \"Do tell.\"\n\nHe had seen Lu Ding's file; even Gao Zhengliang, the director of the Public Security Bureau in Baofan District, gained political achievements just by hanging around Lu Ding.\n\nNow it was his turn!\n\nHe deserved these easy pickings.\n\nLi Kai felt a slight sense of anticipation in his heart.\n\nHe then heard Lu Ding roughly explain the situation regarding the Tianli Sect.\n\nBut he didn't say that the Tianli Sect was after him.\n\nHe still didn't know who had leaked the information.\n\nSo, it was better not to alert the enemy for now.\n\nAnyway, the Tianli Sect was an evil cult, and dealing with evil cults was everyone's responsibility within 749.\n\nAnd it wasn't just one or two.\n\nHmm... how could that not count as a political achievement?\n\nLi Kai understood.\n\n\"So we're ganging up?\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell my people to depart immediately?\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Lu Ding interrupted him, continuing, \"I've seen the map of Luanshida Dam. There aren't many people nearby, so tell your people to bring all the heavy firepower.\"",

    "content": "......\n\n\"What rocket launchers, anti-equipment sniper rifles, grenades, powerful anti-Qi Cultivator weapons...\"\n\nWhat era is this?\n\nStill playing that close combat stuff?\n\nThere are no ordinary people around, so no fear of collateral damage. Go as big as you can.\n\nStrive to let not a single one escape.\n\nLu Ding had read similar novels about official forces besieging villains before. (Not aimed at anyone in particular; if there's any resemblance, it's purely coincidental.)\n\nIn mountain forests, hundreds of miles across with no people around.\n\nIn such situations, the mission set by the authorities would be deemed extremely dangerous.\n\nAnd yet!\n\nThey wouldn't even use modern weapons!\n\nThen they'd go, achieve a bitter victory, and a few would even manage to escape—can you believe it?\n\nYes!\n\nLu Ding admitted that letting people escape benefits the subsequent plot development.\n\nBut don't treat your readers like idiots.\n\nWhy couldn't you set it in a small city where heavy weapons couldn't be used?\n\nIn a mountain forest, just carpet bomb the area to clear out the cannon fodder, then send in a group of elites to surround the masters unaffected by gunfire.\n\nThat way, losses are minimized, and gains are maximized. Why risk human lives to fill the gap?\n\nThose who know a mission is dangerous yet charge forward without batting an eye.\n\nShouldn't you save such people for other matters?\n\nThen send another team to set traps on the inevitable retreat path of those masters when they're distracted and held back.\n\nBury explosives.\n\nSet up formations.\n\nIf they still manage to escape after all that.\n\nThen they're truly impressive, no argument there.\n\nThis was how Lu Ding thought when he read novels in his past life, and now he finally had the chance to implement it.\n\nRun?\n\nIf even one person manages to escape today, he'll eat every single pebble on that rocky embankment, on that puddle of pebbles, no matter how many there are.\n\nAfter listening intently to all of Lu Ding's arrangements.\n\nLi Kai shot him a sideways glance.\n\n\"You... your plan, it doesn't quite match your personality.\"\n\nThis was too cautious.\n\n\"It's just that the commotion will be a bit big. What if ordinary people hear it...?\"\n\n\"Once the battlefield is cleared, and it's raining today, find a few Qi Cultivators to cast spells to wash over that riverbank. Then, issue a public notice saying it's a military exercise with fighter jets flying at low altitude. Everything will be sorted.\"\n\nLu Ding directly laid out the post-incident handling.\n\nLi Kai gave a thumbs up: \"Brilliant, you're still the best. Alright, let's do as you say. I'll send messages to call people now.\"\n\nHe pulled out his phone.\n\n[Mealtime at Rubble Beach. Bring all the heavy gear.]\n\nWith matters here settled.\n\nLu Ding leaned back: \"I'm off now.\"\n\nLi Baoxiang didn't expect Lu Ding to even greet him.\n\nHis heart swelled with gratitude.\n\nHe immediately climbed up and kowtowed three times to Lu Ding.\n\n\"Lord Lu Taisui, thank you!\"\n\nLu Ding ignored him and turned to leave.\n\n.....\n\nAt Rubble Beach that night, the rain poured down.\n\nFigures shrouded in spiritual energy to ward off the rain arrived from all directions.\n\nThey gradually converged into a small group of over twenty people, standing in the rain, quietly waiting.\n\nAmong them, one figure had fiery red hair.\n\nFlames flickered on and off in his hand, constantly flashing.\n\nThis person was Chang Yan, the Fire Pillar, one of the Heavenly Principle Sect's Three Poles and Nine Pillars.\n\nChang Yan looked up at the sky, removed the spiritual energy covering his face, and felt the rainwater wash over him, dripping down his jawline.\n\n\"Hmph~ I really hate rainy days.\"\n\nHe was the Fire Pillar, and water and fire have always been incompatible. Although Chang Yan's fire wouldn't be extinguished by rain.\n\nHe just didn't like rainy days.\n\nIt was annoying, making him uncomfortable...\n\nThe sound of the rain was also noisy.\n\n\"Lord Fire Pillar is right, everything was fine, who knew it would suddenly rain? Jinshan's awful weather has caused you trouble, all because Lu Ding had to come here.\"\n\nThe person next to him spoke with a fawning expression.\n\nNot only was the flattery mediocre, but not everyone liked to hear such words.\n\nChang Yan, already annoyed by the rain's noise, heard the person next to him chattering.\n\nHe shot him a glare.\n\nTongues of flame immediately wrapped around the man, constricting him into three charred segments.\n\n\"Too much talk. He's not someone of your caliber to be evaluating.\"\n\n\"Lord Fire Pillar, there's not much time left until the agreed-upon hour. Ding Buxiu's people still haven't arrived.\"\n\nA woman stepped forward and spoke.\n\nChang Yan's gaze stretched into the distance. Ding Buxiu knew his personality.\n\nWithin the stipulated time, you couldn't be late, nor could you cut it close; you had to arrive early. But Chang Yan wouldn't be a hypocrite; he demanded the same of himself as he did of others.\n\nSo, Ding Buxiu's absence now made him suspicious.\n\n\"Have they been located?\"\n\nThe woman manipulated her watch, zooming in and out with two fingers, confirming the location.\n\n\"I located their phones. I just reconfirmed, they're still at Jinshan Yipin Fresh and haven't moved.\"\n\n\"Calculating by distance, even if they started coming now, pushing their hardest, they would only barely make it on time.\"\n\nHearing this.\n\nFlames surged in Chang Yan's hand again.\n\nThey burned fiercely, letting the rain fall, showing no sign of extinguishing.\n\n\"Looks like something happened.\"\n\nBut even knowing something had happened, Chang Yan had no intention of retreating.\n\n\"Then we won't wait for them. Distribute the intel and the pills, then disperse and hide. Given Lu Ding's personality, since he could touch the Kou family's ancestral grave.\"\n\n\"That proves that this matter will end today, and he will depart tomorrow.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a smile appeared on Chang Yan's face.\n\nFrom the bottom of his heart.\n\nIt was an appreciation for someone with a similar personality.\n\nThis mission was also one he had actively requested.\n\nIt was to see Lu Ding one last time.\n\nAnd to personally send this person, whom he had never met but whose personality was quite similar, on their final journey.\n\n\"Do you think, if such events hadn't transpired, and we had met when our interests didn't clash, would we have become friends?\"\n\nThe girl pondered the question carefully.\n\nShe nodded affirmingly: \"Absolutely. Although Lord Lu Taisui's methods are ruthless, according to our information, he is not a senselessly brutal person. Wherever he has gone.\"\n\n\"Many people speak highly of him.\"\n\nChang Yan's expression was satisfied, yet slightly regretful.\n\n\"It shouldn't have been like this, but it is. Then let me give him a final dignified send-off, so that death doesn't come so painfully.\"\n\nBang bang bang bang...\n\nSudden, continuous gunfire erupted.\n\nAlmost every Heavenly Principle Sect Qi Cultivator on the rocky embankment was hit by a shot.\n\nUnder fair and impartial targeting, half of the Qi Cultivators had their skulls flying everywhere.\n\nImmediately followed by rocket-propelled grenade shells trailing white smoke, flying in. Under intense bombardment, more were killed and wounded.\n\nLu Ding flew down from the sky, observing the situation below.\n\nHe was immensely satisfied with his arrangements.\n\n\"This is how it should be.\"\n\n\"Why not bring more powerful sniper rifles? Arrange one for everyone, how good would that be?\"\n\nIn movies and TV shows, there are often scenes where one person is shot dead, which then alerts the enemy, who start seeking cover and counterattacking.\n\nEvery time he watched, Lu Ding would think.\n\nAre they short on a few sniper rifles?\n\nIs such a large organization so poor it's dying?\n\nWhy can't you arrange a few more?\n\nYou have the first-strike advantage, you kill one, and then you alarm a whole group!?\n\nIsn't that just insane?\n\nNow, with dozens of anti-equipment sniper rifles all targeting simultaneously, Lu Ding only wanted to say one word.\n\nAwesome!!!",

    "content": ".....\n\nThose things, used as weapons to hit people, the effect is simply amazing!!!\n\nLook at each and every one of them.\n\nThe ones who got hit were 'at a loss'.\n\nBelow, Chang Yan raised his hand, pulling flames to ignite the incoming cannonballs and bullets in the air.\n\nUnder the high temperature, the rain turned into white mist, spreading across the entire riverbed.\n\nHe sensed something and looked up.\n\nHis gaze met Lu Ding's.\n\nChang Yan waved his hand, and flames drew characters in the sky.\n\n'Hello Lu Ding'\n\nThis caught Lu Ding off guard; he was quite polite.\n\nThen, flames spurted from Chang Yan's feet, propelling him into the sky, where he stood eye-level with Lu Ding.\n\nHow Lu Ding knew about this matter, Chang Yan didn't want to know.\n\nHe was the target, and the outcome would soon be clear; that was enough.\n\n\"Chang Yan, Fire Pillar of the Tianli Sect, it's an honor to meet Corpse-Dissolving Tai Sui. Your great name precedes you. As a greeting gift, I will personally handle your death; it will be dignified and glorious. If these people from Jinshan 749 can stop me, then we will die together.\"\n\nHis attitude just now made Lu Ding decide to let him finish speaking.\n\n\"I rarely let an enemy speak an extra half-sentence in front of me.\"\n\n\"I feel honored, but I also rarely speak nonsense with enemies.\"\n\nLu Ding smiled: \"Then I also feel very honored. In return, later you can choose to die without pain, or you can choose to endure extreme pain and greet the most elegant and splendid death.\"\n\nThis person didn't look bad.\n\nHis attitude also deserved the Floral Coffin Burial.\n\nChang Yan spread his arms wide to both sides.\n\nFireballs burst into flames, soaring dozens of meters high. Ethereal fire snakes coiled around his body, circling from his waist up to his shoulders. Finally, he looked at Lu Ding, his eyes malevolent and venomous.\n\n\"If I truly am defeated, then I ask you, grant me the most elegant way to die.\"\n\nBOOM!!!!\n\nAs the flames in his hand burst forth, dense fire crows flew out, their flapping wings creating high temperatures.\n\nAs the rain evaporated and mist spread, the temperature was so high that for an ordinary person, wherever they touched, they'd be cooked.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand, unleashing thousands of slashes.\n\nAs the fire crows shattered, sparks flew wildly, hitting the pebbles on the rocky riverbed, burning a hole in each one.\n\nChang Yan retreated mid-air, formed a hand seal, and pressed.\n\nHe directly started with an overpower technique.\n\nThe killing blow was ready.\n\nMeeting was meeting, admiration was admiration, but once they started fighting, they were enemies; it was a life-or-death situation!\n\nFlames ignited in his pupils.\n\nFire snakes coiled around both his arms, extending to his palms. The twin snakes opened their mouths, and firelight emerged.\n\n[One of Fire Pillar's Killing Moves: Great Blaze's Cry]\n\nA pillar of flame, dozens of meters in diameter, erupted, carving a path hundreds of meters across the sky.\n\nUnder such a terrifying attack, Chang Yan felt a pang of sadness.\n\n\"This is my killing move, and also my respect for you.\"\n\nHe didn't think Lu Ding could survive taking this move head-on.\n\nAs for dodging.....\n\nIt would be difficult.\n\nIf Lu Ding really dodged, he still had other killing moves.\n\nSuddenly.\n\nThe hairs on Chang Yan's back stood on end.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, a figure shifted to his side and stabilized, followed by afterimages.\n\nThe scene changed abruptly, tension mounting.\n\nChang Yan's eyeballs hadn't even had time to turn.\n\nHe understood in his heart that his other killing moves seemed unusable now.\n\nHe saw Lu Ding, a fist drawn back.\n\nVeins bulged on the back of his hand, and white mist sprayed from his elbow.\n\n\"Hiss.......\"\n\nThen came an intense, muffled hum.\n\nA Mach Ring appeared as the punch struck heavily. Air swirled past his arm, and the high-temperature white mist instantly burst open and dispersed from that area.\n\nBANG!!!\n\nOne punch!!!\n\nThe surging momentum carried away raindrops that had fallen from the sky into this area, blowing them nearly a thousand meters from their original landing spot.\n\nThe noisy sound of rain instantly ceased.\n\nAs if heaven and earth had fallen silent.\n\nChang Yan looked up at the sky. There was no more Spiritual Qi adhering to his face to avoid the rain, but this time, the rain he hated had quieted for a few seconds.\n\n\"Hmph..... I really didn't want to die on a rainy day.\"\n\nPitter-patter......\n\nThe sound of rain resumed across heaven and earth.\n\nThe view zoomed in.\n\nLu Ding's punch didn't send Chang Yan flying; instead, it directly shattered more than half of his body.\n\nHis flesh and organs had long since exploded, disappearing to who knows where.\n\nAs for why he didn't hit his head?\n\nLu Ding had said he would give him the most elegant way to die.\n\nIn his dying moments, Chang Yan looked at Lu Ding:\n\n\"You're much stronger than what was written in the intel, Lu Ding. You and I are very much alike. I didn't die by conspiracy or scheme, and neither should you. I only know he has a small inverted triangle tattoo behind his ear......\"\n\nAfter speaking these words, Chang Yan's body fell from the sky, breaking through the still-lingering white mist as it descended towards the rocky beach.\n\nLu Ding reached down: \"You were also very strong.\"\n\nThe Floral Coffin Burial quietly activated.\n\nThe scene shifted, grass waves rolled. Chang Yan, with his failing vision, could see the blue sky and white clouds. The smile playing on his lips was his last bit of strength.\n\nFlower buds rooted and bloomed on his body.\n\nA flower tree shot skyward, lifting the floral coffin.\n\nIt burst open, scattering petals across the sky, their vibrant colors echoing Chang Yan's hair color.\n\nImages appeared within each petal.\n\nFinally, he saw his favorite clear sky.\n\nChang Yan's expression at death was inexplicably peaceful, the smile on his face frozen forever at that moment.\n\nUntil the petals landed.\n\nLu Ding stepped onto the crest of the grass waves.\n\nThe intel on Chang Yan that he had read on the way here flashed through his mind.\n\nChang Yan, one of the Nine Pillars and Three Extremes of the Tianli Sect, the Fire Pillar, twenty-two years old, born in a remote mountain village. His mother was trafficked, and there was a significant age gap between his parents.\n\nIn the past, his father would either beat or curse his mother. The sensible Chang Yan often protected his mother, only to end up being beaten by his father as well.\n\nLater, when Chang Yan was thirteen, his mother was accidentally hit in the head by his father and became mentally incapacitated.\n\nLater, when he was fourteen.\n\nOne day, his father returned drunk again. Seeing Chang Yan's mother mentally incapacitated and unable to do housework, he grew disgusted. He picked up the family's pestle and subjected Chang Yan's mother to another brutal beating.\n\nThe fourteen-year-old Chang Yan finally erupted.\n\nHe raised a knife and hacked his father to death.\n\nHe fled with his mother to another province. At sixteen, his mother suddenly fell critically ill. Chang Yan carried her on his back through a rainy night, rushing to the hospital.\n\nAlong the way, he encountered cars and prostrated himself, but dozens passed, and not one stopped.\n\nFinally, his mother died in the rainy night, at which point they were still two kilometers from the hospital.\n\nChang Yan awakened his inherent power that night.\n\nFrom then on, he joined the Tianli Sect.\n\nSeveral years later, he became the Fire Pillar of the Tianli Sect.\n\nThinking of this, Lu Ding reached out and pinched a falling petal.\n\n\"Henceforth, I gift you these fresh flowers; gallop through flowers towards the clear sky.\"\n\nAlthough their positions were different, Lu Ding had to praise him, saying he was a true man.\n\nThis was also another reason why he had listened to Chang Yan speak.\n\nTucking away the petal.\n\nThe battle below involved Bai Hemian and Li Kai, as well as Jinshan 749 investigators whose numbers were several times greater than the Tianli Sect's.\n\nIt was a one-sided slaughter.\n\nAll personnel were cleared out.\n\nFinally, only the girl who had been standing next to Chang Yan at the beginning remained. She was still stubbornly resisting Bai Hemian's attacks.\n\nBy a single move.\n\nBai Hemian grabbed her wrist and twisted it, and Corpse Qi spread.\n\nThe girl, with a fierce resolve, swung her blade and severed her own arm.\n\nShe retreated a few steps, then looked up at the sky.\n\nShe saw Lu Ding standing alone.\n\nTwo lines of clear tears rolled down her face.",

After it instantly turned to ash, she swung her blade with a backhand, severing her neck.\n\nThere wasn't a trace of hesitation, nor any lingering attachment.\n\nThe body split in two.\n\nBai Hemian was a little puzzled.\n\nHe could understand severing the hand; if she didn't, the corpse qi entering her body would cause her great pain.\n\nBut severing the head...\n\nHe hadn't even struck her head.\n\nWhy was this?\n\nLu Ding floated down.\n\n\"Don't understand now, do you?\"\n\nBai Hemian shook his head.\n\n\"What she did is called 'suicide for love'. It looks like she had a strong unrequited love for Chang Yan. Seeing that Chang Yan was dead, she had no lingering attachments either, so she simply went with him.\"\n\nHearing Lu Ding's explanation.\n\nBai Hemian still didn't quite get it.\n\n\"You really hit the jackpot today, had your eyes opened, haven't you?\"\n\nBai Hemian nodded. Indeed, his eyes had been opened. Someone could actually cut off their own head without even blinking.\n\n\"I've heard the rumors, they were all just stories. Never seen it in reality.\"\n\n\"Alright, let's go. Let them clean up the battlefield.\"\n\nLu Ding turned to leave, humming a song.\n\n\"We, who don't understand the torment of love, hate, and resentment... all thought suicide for love was just an ancient legend...\"\n\n\"You can write songs?!\"\n\nBai Hemian's eyes widened. He said incredulously, \"Suicide for love, legend—weren't those just mentioned?\"\n\n\"Can you just come up with them on the spot?\"\n\n\"Is it that smooth?\"\n\n\"And... it actually sounds quite good.\"\n\n\"If I could write this song, I wouldn't have been a broke university student all those years. Now I just remembered it and sang it, and I even got the lyrics wrong. Don't bother me, let me straighten it out.\"\n\nBeing a plagiarist wasn't that easy. Lu Ding had tried it before, but it didn't work.\n\nHe couldn't compose, and the accompanying music didn't have the right feel; it always felt off.\n\nLater, he learned composition.\n\nBut he forgot the lyrics, only remembering some key and classic phrases.\n\nHe tried writing some to fill in, but no matter how he sang it, it just wasn't right.\n\nIt often ended up like a toilet lid inlaid with gold.\n\nLater, he gradually gave up.\n\nHearing Lu Ding say this, Bai Hemian didn't believe it one bit.\n\nHe felt as if he had discovered many of Lu Ding's secrets.\n\nAll-capable, all-knowing.\n\nIt was also rare for him to make such a deadpan joke.\n\n\"Remembered it? Did you remember something from your past life that you didn't quite forget?\"\n\nLu Ding ignored him.\n\nHumming the song, he walked forward.\n\nBai Hemian quickly chased after him: \"Did you just recite a poem?\"\n\n\"It was an impromptu expression.\"\n\nBai Hemian listened in silence beside him. After they had walked out of the rocky shoals, he said, \"Lu Ding, if I'm gone someday, will you write a poem for me?\"\n\n\"Or if I die with a body, could you also turn me into flowers?\"\n\n\"Remember to use a stone to press me down in front of my grandma's grave, so I don't get blown away.\"\n\nLu Ding: .........\n\nHe rolled his eyes: \"You don't think about anything good, always talking about life and death every day. Who taught you to aspire to death like this? Tell me, I'll go slap them twice.\"\n\n\"Who taught you?\"\n\n\"Teaching a kid like this.\"\n\n\"Isn't living better?\"\n\n\"Turn you into flowers? I'll blast you to dust.\"\n\nBai Hemian stared straight at him: \"You.\"\n\nLu Ding pointed at himself with his finger: \"Me?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's you. Last time you said Kou Huaiyi was too ugly to deserve your technique of turning people into flowers.\"\n\n\"But even though he was so ugly, he actually got to enjoy such good treatment.\"\n\n\"And this time, Chang Yan really deserved it. How beautiful he died! If I could choose how to die, I'd definitely choose this way. And you even wrote a poem for him.\"\n\n\"His departure was both beautiful and elegant.\"\n\nIt was rare to hear Bai Hemian say so much.\n\nBut it was all things Lu Ding didn't want to hear.\n\n\"You're insane.\"\n\nLu Ding strode away, secretly making a decision in his heart.\n\nIn the future, he would have to change the flower petals to black.\n\nOther colors were too beautiful, too elegant. If they attracted more people like Bai Hemian who were looking for death in the future...\n\n...just to die elegantly.\n\nWouldn't he be busy to death?\n\nHowever, Bai Hemian's words did remind Lu Ding.\n\nHe took out his phone and glanced at the map.\n\nJust right, the route to Yunmeng passed by where Chang Yan buried his mother.\n\nHe just couldn't take a plane anymore.\n\nBut it didn't matter.\n\nLu Ding decided to send the petal in his pocket to the grave of Chang Yan's mother.\n\nIn life, they were opponents, with different stances.\n\nIn death, Lu Ding respected him as a true man, so this matter could be done.\n\nIncidentally, he also had to make a trip to Chang Yan's hometown.\n\nAnyway, it was roughly in the general direction of Yunmeng.\n\nIt wasn't that Lu Ding had nothing better to do; such matters could be entirely handed over to the local authorities.\n\nHe could make a phone call, and they'd handle it for him overnight.\n\nBut!\n\nIf things followed such a procedure, Lu Ding would be displeased.\n\nIf he was displeased, no one else would have an easy time.\n\nAs for whether there would be disciplinary action from above afterward, let there be disciplinary action; he didn't care how they disciplined him.\n\nFrom the perspective of Qi Refiner management, this matter was unjustifiable.\n\nHe'd have to be penalized, but that was for later.\n\nBut from Lu Ding's emotional standpoint, not doing this was even more unjustifiable.\n\nHe had to do it, and he had to do it now.\n\nDamn it, you've all been spoiled.\n\nYou won't break me.\n\nHe tapped his phone, requesting information on Chang Yan's hometown. He specifically added a note: \"Detailed, must be detailed.\"\n\n\"Which family did this, which family didn't?\"\n\n\"If you can't confirm, send someone immediately to confirm now. I want to see a reply tomorrow.\"\n\nWith matters here handled.\n\nOn the other side, Lan Mingli, who was heading back, didn't even stop. He took his aunt, Lan Ya, and left by \"flying taxi.\"\n\nNot staying in Jinshan for even a moment longer.\n\nOn the plane, Lan Mingli turned his head to look out the window.\n\nLan Ya leaned forward and looked up: \"Crying?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then why are your eyes red?\"\n\n\"Didn't sleep today, so I'm tired.\"\n\n\"Oh~ Even a Divine Palace gets tired from not sleeping?\"\n\n\"Auntie!!!\"\n\nLan Mingli turned around, his emotions a little agitated.\n\n\"Auntie, do you know who he is? He's Lu Ding! Why isn't he staying in his cultivation training grounds? What's he doing running off to Jinshan?!\"\n\n\"Isn't he just bullying people?!\"\n\n\"And that Bai Hemian, he's also a bully, no good at all, a typical tyrant.\"\n\n\"Don't we have a rule in Yunmeng that anyone under twenty who defeats a person on the Talent List can obtain a heavenly material and earthly treasure from their family?\"\n\n\"He even picked it out specifically!\"\n\n\"He specifically named the Wind-Roaring Stone! This is just bullying!\"\n\nLan Ya listened, her eyes a little melancholic.\n\nLu Ding... Bai Hemian...\n\nAs expected, they had significant backgrounds.\n\nThe Kou family...\n\nSigh...\n\nSeeing Lan Ya fall silent for a moment, Lan Mingli comforted her, \"Auntie, don't be sad. I'm fine.\"\n\nLan Ya felt a bit awkward.\n\nHow to say this?\n\nShould she say she wasn't sad for him, but was just silently bidding farewell to Kou Jingshen?\n\nAnd also making a final farewell to her years of youth spent in Jinshan?\n\nNight passed in a flash.\n\nDay arrived.\n\nInside Jinshan's 749 Investigation Bureau.\n\nLu Ding was resting.\n\nSitting cross-legged on the bed, he took out the Water-Stabilizing Lotus Mist.\n\nIncidentally, he spent seven hundred contribution points to exchange for several heavenly materials and earthly treasures of decent quality.\n\nContribution points could be used anywhere within the 749 Bureau, provided the local inventory and quality could meet your exchange needs.\n\nFortunately, Jinshan 749 wasn't particularly small.\n\nIt could fully accommodate Lu Ding's spending.\n\nOf the seven hundred contribution points, three hundred were from Li Kai buying the tree, and the remaining four hundred were awarded to Lu Ding by Jinshan.\n\nWith the Heavenly Principle Cult and the Kou family involved, four hundred was entirely reasonable.\n\nNow that the heavenly materials and spiritual treasures were in place, Lu Ding was about to add bricks and tiles to his Divine Palace!",

    "content": "Under the circulation of the cultivation technique, the sleeping karmic dragon awoke once more.\n\nCultivation techniques, these things.\n\nHow should I put it?\n\nIt's like during school, regular classes, and the final exam's total score.\n\nNormally, you have to attend classes diligently, study hard, put in your own effort, and finally apply what you've learned to gain results.\n\nThen finally, see if you have enough spiritual aptitude and talent; only by combining these can you get the final score.\n\nBut Lu Ding isn't like that.\n\nHe does it in reverse.\n\nWith heaven-human unity within him, this thing can't be controlled.\n\nIt swooshes into his mind, with a sudden whoosh—hey, it's connected.\n\nAs for where it leads, he doesn't know; it simply can't be stopped, it just rushes forward.\n\nOthers all write out a solution, then circulate through meridians, operate the microcosmic orbit—which is like the process and formula—finally deriving the result.\n\nLu Ding is like, *bam*, the answer is slapped right there for you.\n\nThen, he reverses the deduction.\n\nDon't mind how I arrived at it; just tell me if the answer is right or not?\n\nIn school, teachers said the process is important, we need to progress gradually.\n\nWhen working, bosses said the result is important, stop blabbering useless stuff, I want to see the results.\n\nNow, Lu Ding is the latter.\n\nAs the medicinal effects of the heavenly materials and earthly treasures flowed in.\n\nThe spiritual sea surged, and the karmic dragon galloped.\n\nLuminous particles continuously gathered and rose, surging towards the phantom of the divine palace, forming walls and tiles, serving as pillars and eaves.\n\nAs his aura continuously strengthened.\n\nOne could see high walls slowly rising, flowing light shimmering, divine radiance meandering, carving various divine wonders, and embedding treasures everywhere.\n\nAt first glance, it was adorned with pearls, edged with gold, and magnificently splendid.\n\nThen, the special effects disappeared.\n\nThe medicinal effect wasn't enough; see you next time.\n\nLu Ding's realm also went from the first level of the Divine Palace realm to the second level.\n\nHis aura gradually receded.\n\nThe path he travels is unimpeded and long; if he travels, he will arrive, and the future is promising.\n\nOriginally, the path was arduous and long.\n\nBut Lu Ding's path has a flat road ahead, no obstacles, and no bottlenecks.\n\nAs long as he walks, a broad, smooth path is right under his feet, leading straight to the end.\n\nThe only obstacle might just be resource issues.\n\nNow that he's at the second level of the Divine Palace realm, the heavenly materials and earthly treasures required for subsequent realms will only increase.\n\nCultivation is like climbing a mountain, each step a new heaven.\n\n\"I hope to farm some good stuff in Yunmeng.\"\n\nNext, he needs to condense methods to lock the dragon and forge a well.\n\nSo the quantity and quality of heavenly materials and earthly treasures are crucial. Although Lu Ding doesn't expect this trip to Yunmeng to directly push his realm to Destiny Overseer.\n\nThis would be nothing short of a fool's dream.\n\nBut Divine Palace?\n\nDivine Palace second level corresponds to the Dragon-Locking Well, Divine Palace fourth level corresponds to the Karmic Dragon Breaking the Well, and sixth level carries the river to rush the sea.\n\nAfter that, he'll go to Ba'er Mountain to grab another haul. Once he goes back and submits the mission, three dragon vein earth energies—this will be another wave of rewards to strengthen himself.\n\n\"My future is indeed promising.\"\n\nLu Ding said this.\n\nHe took out his phone to check; at this time, it was already the third day.\n\nHe sent a message to Bai Hemian, telling him to prepare for departure.\n\nLu Ding got up and washed himself.\n\nAs soon as the room door was pulled open, Bai Hemian, squatting outside the door, looked up: \"You've gotten stronger again.\"\n\n\"I get stronger every day.\"\n\nLu Ding walked out.\n\nAfter a simple farewell to Li Kai, the two sat on the high-speed rail and headed all the way in the general direction of Yunmeng.\n\nOf course, Lu Ding still had to make a stop in Chang Yan's hometown, Longyang.\n\nOn the train, Lu Ding was thinking about Chang Yan's words.\n\n\"Inverted triangle tattoo behind the ear...\"\n\nOnce these two sets of missions are done and things are handled, he'll go back and grab each of the trainees and instructors to look at them.\n\nTo be safe, and to prevent anyone from using any concealment potions.\n\nLu Ding sent a message to Elder Deng of Yunhai 749.\n\nInquiring if there was anything very powerful that could erase masking fluids.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, there really was.\n\nBut it wasn't cheap.\n\nLu Ding waved his hand, saying, \"Money should be spent where it counts.\"\n\nBut he had no money now, so he'd owe it for now.\n\nElder Deng laughed and scolded him for not saving money.\n\nBut he agreed, \"Only this once, no more after this, alright?\"\n\nLu Ding uttered words of gratitude, opened his music app again, preparing to listen to songs, when he turned his head.\n\nHe saw Bai Hemian next to him, stretching his neck to look at the screen of the phone in front of them.\n\nLu Ding waved his hand in front of his eyes: \"What are you doing, what are you doing? Kids shouldn't peek at other people's phones, that's their privacy.\"\n\nBai Hemian: \"Huh? Aren't I older?\"\n\n\"I'm taller than you.\"\n\n\"Weren't we talking about age?\"\n\n\"I have more meat than you, I'm heavier than you.\"\n\n\"Weren't we talking about age?\"\n\n\"I'm more powerful than you, my realm is higher than yours. I'm at the Divine Palace second level now.\"\n\n\"We—\"\n\nBai Hemian's words caught in his throat; he didn't want to continue discussing this issue with Lu Ding, and continued craning his neck to look at the phone in front of them.\n\nChanging the subject, he said: \"There's a ghost in her phone.\"\n\nLu Ding's ears pricked up: \"Hm?\"\n\n\"Well, this is certainly rare. The times are indeed changing, all sorts of new species are appearing. Let me see what's going on.\"\n\nThen, the scene changed from Bai Hemian alone craning his neck to two people craning their necks to look at the phone in front of them.\n\nUpon seeing this, Lu Ding was disappointed.\n\nHe had thought some rare species had actually appeared.\n\nSimilar to Sadako: that one climbed out of the TV, this one climbed out of a phone.\n\nIn the end, it was just someone making a video call.\n\nBut the face on the other side of the video was still fresh in Lu Ding's mind.\n\nIt was none other than the girl he saved from Dinghao Residential Area, Dong Wenrui.\n\nHe then heard the girl on the phone saying.\n\n\"The air back home is really good, with beautiful mountains and clear waters. Lili, you definitely have to come visit me if you have time.\"\n\nThe girl called Lili on this side responded with a smile.\n\n\"Don't worry, don't worry. But are you really not coming back to Yunhai? What exactly did you encounter last time? And that old person whose pulse stopped, why did it stop?\"\n\nHearing her good friend mention this again.\n\nDong Wenrui subconsciously shivered inside.\n\nGo back to Yunhai?\n\nWas she tired of living too long?\n\nShe picked the less important points to answer: \"I'm not going back to Yunhai. After my grandpa passed away, Grandma went back to our hometown to live alone. She's all alone, so I need to spend more time with her.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Dong Wenrui shifted the camera to face the elder.\n\nAt this sight.\n\nLu Ding knew where the ghost Bai Hemian mentioned was.\n\nThe elder was rosy-cheeked and radiant, with a smiling face, looking full of vigor and energy. But if you looked closely, you would find the elder had inverted eight-shaped lines on her face, white sores on her neck, and black aura gathered in her eyes.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding didn't know what this thing was, it definitely wasn't human.\n\nThis girl also had bad luck: encountering a shadow domain overlap in Yunhai, she had just moved, and the apartments upstairs and downstairs were all monsters.\n\nAs a result, upon returning to her hometown, her own grandma turned into a monster.\n\nThinking of this.\n\nLu Ding pulled out his phone and sent a message to the bureau, asking them to check where Dong Wenrui was, and then incidentally notify the 749 Bureau near her to go take a look.\n\nBut just as the message was sent.\n\nIn the video, the girl called out: \"Blind Granny.\"\n\nAnother elder walked into the frame, holding medicine in one hand and a black wooden plaque in the other.\n\nThe elder's slightly hoarse voice rang out.\n\n\"Old sister, time for medicine.\"\n\nThis \"old sister\" was addressed to Dong Wenrui's grandma.",

    "content": "As the old woman entered the frame, Lu Ding immediately recognized she wasn't an ordinary person.\n\nAs for whether there was an issue with that bowl of medicine, he didn't know.\n\nDong Wenrui's grandmother took the medicine bowl and drank it on the side.\n\nBlind Granny took a small stool and sat down.\n\nDong Wenrui held up her phone and said to the girl on her side, \"Lili, look, this is Blind Granny. While we weren't home these past few days, she's been brewing medicine for Grandma.\"\n\nThe girl on this side also sweetly called out to Blind Granny.\n\n\"We're all neighbors, it's only right to look out for each other.\"\n\nAs the old woman spoke, she placed the wooden plaque in her hand onto her lap.\n\nHe heard her say, \"Ah, getting old, getting old. After a few days of work, my hands are shaking, and my eyes can't see clearly anymore.\"\n\nLu Ding looked at the bogwood plaque on the old woman's lap.\n\nSuspicion rose in his heart: What was she up to?\n\n\"Blind Granny, when I came back a few days ago, I saw you carving. What is this?\" Dong Wenrui asked curiously.\n\nBlind Granny explained to her, \"This is a spirit tablet. An elder brother of mine had an accident; they encountered an earthquake, and his entire family, old and young, perished.\"\n\n\"He was kind to me in the past, so I thought I'd do what I could for them.\"\n\nElder brother? Earthquake?\n\nEntire family gone?\n\nLu Ding frowned upon hearing this, \"Such a coincidence????\"\n\nBefore Dong Wenrui in the frame could even voice her opinion.\n\nThe old woman continued, \"Xiao Dong, my hands are shaking terribly. How about you help me carve it?\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\nDong Wenrui felt conflicted. Carving a spirit tablet for a stranger... this...\n\nMoreover, she had just experienced the incident at the Dinghao Residential Area in Yunhai and was afraid of encountering such things again in the future.\n\nThat's why she had returned to her hometown.\n\nAnd now you're asking her to carve a spirit tablet?\n\nBut to refuse outright, Dong Wenrui couldn't bring herself to say it.\n\nAfter all, when she and her parents weren't here, Blind Granny had been taking care of Grandma, brewing medicine for her...\n\nBack and forth, Dong Wenrui's heart grew increasingly conflicted.\n\nSeeing that she didn't speak for a while.\n\nThe old woman sighed and said, \"It's alright, it's alright, I can do it myself.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Blind Granny, it's not that I don't want to help you, I'm just afraid...\"\n\n\"It's okay, my good child, you are a filial child.\"\n\nThe old woman said as she carved two strokes, then picked it up and examined it.\n\n\"How about this, child? You help me write a few characters on it, and I'll carve according to the words. My hands are shaking now, and I'm afraid I won't carve it well without the words.\"\n\nCarving a spirit tablet was something Dong Wenrui dared not do, but writing a few characters.\n\nShe still dared.\n\nMainly, she had just refused Blind Granny, and a second refusal now would seem somewhat heartless.\n\n\"No problem, Blind Granny, I'll help you write. Tell me, what do you want to write?\"\n\nLu Ding watched, a cold sneer on his face.\n\nWretched old hag.\n\nShe even knows how to use psychology and Sun Tzu's Art of War.\n\nHer current behavior was precisely the \"House Demolition Effect\" in psychology.\n\nThe general idea is this: if there's a completely enclosed room with no light, and you say, \"Let's open a window.\"\n\nAt this point, someone will surely come to stop you.\n\nBut if you start saying: \"Damn it, it's pitch black, holy shit, is this a place for humans to live? It's like a coffin, we have to tear off the roof!\"\n\nThen, someone will come to persuade you.\n\n\"How about we just open a window, you can't tear off the roof.\"\n\nThis is also what Sun Tzu's Art of War says: \"Aim for the highest, and you get the middle; aim for the middle, and you get the lowest; aim for the lowest, and you get nothing.\"\n\nMaking others concede.\n\n\"These old biddies, how are they all more sinister than the last?\"\n\nLook at Dong Wenrui's bright-eyed, clever look; encountering this old woman, she's practically doomed.\n\nHe then heard the old woman on the other side of the frame speaking.\n\n\"Just write 'Spirit Tablet of Ye Li of Black Mountain Village,' and next to it, add his birthdate and time... and also the date of death...\"\n\nLu Ding narrowed his eyes as he listened.\n\nIndeed, there's no such thing as so many coincidences in the world.\n\nThis was clearly one and the same thing!!\n\nWretched old hag, using this evil spell to oppose me, are you!?\n\nA spirit tablet made of bogwood, an outsider putting brush to paper—this method originated from Chenla.\n\nIt's called 'Life-Refining Ghost-Raising'!\n\nSimply put, it involves finding two people with similar fates, preferably one male and one female, one yin and one yang, one living and one dead.\n\nOne party writes the spirit tablet for the other.\n\nActivated by a secret technique, due to the similar fates, the living person's fate will attract the dead person's fate.\n\nYe Li was already reduced to nothing but dust, so it was absolutely impossible for him to live.\n\nBut fate is something bestowed by Heaven; the stronger the fate, the harder it is to dissipate.\n\nFinding a similar fate, through mutual attraction, can draw in the remaining fate of the deceased and host it within a living person's body.\n\nAs a price, the living person must pay an unequal amount of their lifespan.\n\nFinally, under the activation of the secret technique, the fates of the living and dead merge, becoming something neither fully alive nor fully dead.\n\nThis process is 'Life-Refining Ghost-Raising'.\n\nThe stronger a person's fate, the longer the refining process, and the more ferocious the ghost that ultimately forms.\n\nThe weaker a person's fate, the shorter the refining process, and the resulting ghost will be just a small fry, a petty minion.\n\nLu Ding had glanced at Ye Li's birthdate and time when he was looking at the files earlier.\n\nIt was clearly fake at a glance.\n\nNothing out of the ordinary.\n\nBut what this old woman was now saying was truly extraordinary.\n\nLu Ding thought about Dong Wenrui again.\n\nThis girl's fate was also absurdly strong.\n\nThere were so many houses in Yunhai, yet she went nowhere else but specifically to the Dinghao Residential Area.\n\nAnd something happened on the very first day she went there.\n\nShe was even targeted by a monster.\n\nAnd eventually, it came knocking on her door.\n\nShe stubbornly held on until Lu Ding arrived.\n\nThis was a strong fate, but one that also attracted misfortune.\n\nWhether in Yunhai or in her hometown, she always encountered these troublesome affairs.\n\nIn the frame, Dong Wenrui calculated for a moment.\n\nShe said with some surprise, \"So young!!\"\n\nBlind Granny said somewhat melancholically, \"Yes, gone so young, it's not worth it. I won't live much longer myself, so I'll do what I can for them now.\"\n\nAt this point, Lu Ding had almost entirely deduced her identity.\n\nPrevious intelligence stated that Ye Chengfeng had harbored foreign Qi Refiner criminals, helping them escape.\n\nPresumably, it must be this old woman.\n\nChenla's evil sorcery, and the favor—it all perfectly matched this situation.\n\n\"Won't live much longer?\"\n\n\"I see you're not far from death yourself.\"\n\n\"Coincidentally, I can also do something within my power. Just wait, I'll come find you tonight!\"\n\n\"Blind Granny, I'll turn you into a Dead Granny, then in a few days, a Stinky Granny, a Rotting Granny.\"\n\nLu Ding silently muttered to himself.\n\nHis phone vibrated.\n\nHe picked it up and looked.\n\nThe message showed Dong Wenrui's location was in Longyang, East Mountain Village.\n\nThis indeed made things convenient for Lu Ding.\n\nHis original thought was to notify the nearest 749 unit to go check it out, while he himself would go to deliver the petals and then head straight to Yunmeng.\n\nBut now, plans had changed.\n\nThe petals, he would deliver, but this wretched old hag, he had to kill her too!!\n\nLater, once he got off the train in Longyang, he'd first go deliver the petals, then fly over and bludgeon that old hag to death.\n\nStill, as he'd said before, Ye Li couldn't possibly be alive.\n\nHowever, to be safe, to prevent all unforeseen accidents.\n\nAny unwelcome sprouts must be strangled in the cradle.",

We'll go somewhere else later.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nBai Hemian responded, not asking where.\n\nBut he probably guessed it was very likely because of the person in the video.\n\nHe thought for a moment: \"Shouldn't we warn that girl?\"\n\nLu Ding shook his head: \"No need. If she were going to die, she'd have died long ago. This moment won't make a difference.\"\n\nAfter all, he'd just heard Dong Wenrui say that she saw that old hag carving things a few days ago.\n\n\"If we warn her now, it will only expose her and bring her a deadly disaster.\"\n\nThat's just how it is; who knows how many messy TV shows there are.\n\nOriginally, when people didn't know, nothing happened. But then someone just had to tell others.\n\nAnd then the person who knew the situation couldn't hide it.\n\nDirectly exposed.\n\nWith Dong Wenrui's innocent eyes, that old hag had her completely wrapped around her finger.\n\nLu Ding truly didn't believe she could act the same as before if she knew the situation.\n\nSo, he decided not to tell her for now. Let her carve, let her write. Anyway, he'd arrive by evening at the latest.\n\nHe'd rush there, traveling under the stars, and give that old hag a punch straight to her demise.\n\nAfter that, there would be no problems, and it would be over once heaven and earth reclaimed Ye Li's destiny.\n\nMoreover, Lu Ding had also thought of a way for himself not to be disciplined.\n\nA mischievous smile flashed across his face.\n\nBai Hemian looked at him, full of confusion: \"Why are you angry one moment and laughing the next?\"\n\n\"It's hard for me to explain. Just follow me later.\"\n\nLu Ding said, continuing to listen to music.\n\nHe was so busy every day; everyone needed him everywhere.\n\nHe was simply a brick, Lu Ding, moved wherever needed.\n\nBut it was good too; all problems could be nipped in the bud.\n\nIt wasn't that trouble found him, but that he sought out trouble.\n\nChange the order, and the outcome is different.\n\nHere, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian were still on their way to Longyang.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nYunmeng.\n\nThe Lan Family.\n\nLan Mingli, back in Yunmeng, grew more and more indignant the more he thought about it.\n\nFor these three days, he had tossed and turned, unable to sleep. No matter how he thought about it, it boiled down to just three words:\n\nBullying people!!!\n\nToo much bullying!!\n\nThen a thought flashed through his mind.\n\n\"Aren't you, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian, coming to Yunmeng!?\"\n\n\"Aren't you challenging the Yunmeng prodigies!?\"\n\n\"Fine, I'll give you a good promotion!\"\n\nThrough his confrontations with Lu Ding and Bai Hemian, he understood that the combat power of these two, just Bai Hemian alone, was not something anyone below the top three of the Prodigy Rankings could touch.\n\nAs for Lu Ding, probably only the top-ranked could compete with him.\n\nToo terrifying.\n\nAnd Lan Mingli? He was ranked ninth.\n\nThinking from a different perspective, as long as all those above him were beaten up, wouldn't he not lose face?\n\nHaving figured this out.\n\nHe immediately began his grand plan to hype up Lu Ding.\n\nAnyway, he lost fair and square; it wasn't shameful. Who could guarantee they'd never lose once in their life?\n\nBlow it up, blow it hard!\n\nIt was an extravagant exaggeration.\n\nMany people doubted the truth of it.\n\nLan Mingli directly threw facts in their faces.\n\n\"Is Lu Ding really that powerful? You didn't just lose and then exaggerate like this, did you?\"\n\nLan Mingli: \"Lu Ding, a Linghai, dared to fight a Siming.\"\n\n\"Although Lu Ding is powerful, but you can't boost others' morale and diminish our own prestige.\"\n\nLan Mingli: \"Lu Ding, a Linghai, single-handedly challenged a Siming.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, Lu Ding is powerful, but we're not bad either, okay? And when he fought a Siming, he had a charged move. This isn't a pre-arranged duel; if you catch him off guard and don't allow him to charge, he's just so-so.\"\n\nLan Mingli: \"Lu Ding, a Linghai, solo-killed a Siming.\"\n\nOthers grew exasperated: \"Are you crazy? Is that the only line you know? Did Lu Ding smash your brain?\"\n\nLan Mingli: \"You dare to yell at me?\"\n\n\"I can't beat Lu Ding, but can't I beat you guys?!!\"\n\nLan Mingli went up and gave someone a beating, instantly feeling great.\n\nComfortable, relieved, his mood even improved.\n\nDon't ask, just know he learned it from Bai Hemian.\n\nAs for Bai Hemian, he learned it from Li Baoxiang's aunt, whom he overheard on the phone while standing guard outside the door.\n\nWith his help, the entire Yunmeng knew Lu Ding was coming.\n\nThen, several days passed, and Lu Ding still hadn't arrived.\n\nMany people felt something was wrong.\n\n\"Didn't they say Lu Ding has a short temper? Why hasn't he arrived yet? Could he be scared?\"\n\nOf course, this statement was made primarily to suppress the opponent and elevate oneself in terms of morale. It wouldn't do to be intimidated before the fight.\n\nBut there were always a few thoughtless troublemakers who picked up on it and spread it around.\n\nThree people make a tiger*.\n\nRumors flew everywhere; though not necessarily true, they were entertaining to hear.\n\nAnd they boosted morale.\n\nHere, rumors were fermenting.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nLu Ding arrived in Longyang in the afternoon.\n\nUpon exiting the station, he found a deserted spot, then shot straight up into the sky and flew directly to Chang Yan's mother's grave.\n\nBai Hemian followed, using stealth.\n\nArriving at the location, he saw that the area around the tombstone was clean and tidy.\n\nFresh flowers were leaning against it.\n\nChang Yan had specifically instructed people to replace them daily for his mother.\n\nBut he himself couldn't come because he was a member of the Tianli Cult, and this was a city, part of 749's jurisdiction.\n\nAllowing people to send flowers was fine; 749 tacitly allowed it, pretending not to see. Everyone had family.\n\nBut if you came personally, no, I'd have to arrest you.\n\nNow that Chang Yan was gone, these flowers would probably no longer be sent.\n\nBut it didn't matter.\n\nLu Ding squatted down.\n\nHe pulled out a petal from his pocket, enveloped it with Lingqi, and pressed it firmly onto the tombstone.\n\nThe force penetrated deeply into the stone but didn't crack the tombstone.\n\nA petal imprint appeared on the tombstone.\n\nA gentle breeze blew past, bringing a smile to Lu Ding's lips: \"You must miss her very much too.\"\n\nBai Hemian walked over and handed him the ashes.\n\nLu Ding took them, dug a hole in the ground, and tapped the urn against the tombstone.\n\n\"I don't know what your attitude towards her was, but she followed you when she was alive, and it's better if she follows you in death too.\"\n\n\"Auntie, she liked your son, you know. I won't bury her with you two. You can be neighbors. If you think it's alright, you can persuade Chang Yan to take her in, and then you'll be a family of three.\"\n\nLu Ding buried the urn, covered it with soil.\n\nThen he stomped on it twice to compact it, not bothering with too much formality.\n\nAfterward, he scraped the mud off the soles of his feet by the edge of the pit.\n\nLu Ding looked at Bai Hemian beside him: \"Stick close. We're going to send that troublesome old hag to her demise.\"\n---\n*   \"willing to get flayed to drag the emperor off his horse\": An idiom meaning to risk everything, even one's life, to bring down a powerful figure or achieve a difficult goal.\n*   \"Three people make a tiger\": An idiom meaning a lie or rumor, when repeated by enough people, can come to be believed as truth.",

    "content": "......\n\nDongshan Village, nearing dusk.\n\nSeeing that it was getting late, Dong Wenrui said, \"Blind Granny, it's getting late. I'll take Grandma home first.\"\n\nThe old woman grabbed her wrist.\n\nShe said warmly, \"What's the rush? It'll be a hassle for you to cook when you get back. Come on, come on, let's eat at Granny's house.\"\n\nHearing the words \"eat at Granny's house.\"\n\nDong Wenrui's Adam's apple bobbed.\n\nA few days ago, when she had just returned, she had eaten at Blind Granny's house.\n\nAlthough it wasn't good to always eat free meals at others' homes.\n\nBut the cured meat tasted truly delicious.\n\nIt was irresistible.\n\nWithout a second thought.\n\nHer eyes curved into a smile as she said, \"Thank you, Granny.\"\n\nShe turned to help her grandmother. She didn't know if it was Dong Wenrui's hallucination, but in a trance, she seemed to see a thin film-like substance flash across her grandmother's eyeball.\n\nBecause it was too fast, she didn't get a good look.\n\nShe felt a pang of doubt.\n\nCould she have seen wrong?\n\nHmm...... no!!!!!\n\nThe last time she had such a hallucination was in Dinghao Residential Area.\n\nAt that time, she also thought she was wrong!\n\nBut it turned out to be a monster.\n\nHaving experienced such things, she was now extremely sensitive to them.\n\nThose grandmothers before, hadn't they also failed to recognize that their spouses had problems?\n\nDong Wenrui carefully thought about her grandmother's abnormal behavior over the past few days since her return.\n\nAlthough it all seemed similar.\n\nBut Dong Wenrui always felt something was off.\n\nYet, she couldn't pinpoint what was wrong at that moment.\n\nSo, she could only approach the old woman with a suspicious mind.\n\n\"Let's go, Grandma, we're going to Granny's house for dinner.\"\n\nAs soon as her hand touched her, with flesh-on-flesh contact, a flash of inspiration suddenly struck Dong Wenrui!\n\nHer pulse!\n\nStill the pulse!\n\nBefore, those monsters had a dead person's pulse, which was very eerie.\n\nNow, Grandma's pulse was unbelievably healthy. Wasn't that eerie?\n\nOne must know, Grandma was already over ninety, and Dong Wenrui's father was the old woman's sixth child.\n\nFor someone over ninety, her pulse was perfectly steady, showing no problems at all.\n\nAlthough it's said the world is vast and full of wonders, Dong Wenrui, having learned from previous experiences, plus the spiritual tablet today once again triggering her past memories, felt uneasy.\n\nImmediately.\n\nDong Wenrui said, \"Oh no, my phone's dead. Blind Granny, could you take Grandma over first?\"\n\n\"It's getting late now, and soon it'll be dark and we won't be able to see. Grandma walks slowly.\"\n\n\"I'll go back and get a charger, then I'll be right over.\"\n\n\"Go, go, be careful on the way, don't get bitten by a dog,\" Blind Granny said, taking the old woman's hand and leading her.\n\nAlthough Blind Granny had one blind eye, she had lived in the village for many years and had walked this road countless times.\n\nShe could find her way home with her eyes closed by now.\n\nDong Wenrui turned and jogged away.\n\nWatching her disappear from sight.\n\nBlind Granny's kind smile instantly turned sinister.\n\n\"Beast! If you can't stay in this skin any longer, I'll flay you alive!\"\n\nThe old woman opened her mouth, looked up, then down, letting out an \"aowu...\"\n\nBlind Granny then narrowed her eyes, looking in the direction Dong Wenrui had left.\n\n\"So.... what was she thinking just now? She must have seen.......\"\n\n....\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nDong Wenrui ran home, deliberately messed up the house, then turned and ran to the dry toilet, lifting the lid.\n\nSuppressing her nausea, she jumped right in.\n\nThe sewage water came up to her waist.\n\nDong Wenrui subtly took breaths, suppressing the gasps that should have burst forth.\n\nImages flashed through her mind.\n\nWhen she had encountered the Dinghao Residential Area incident in Yunhai before, she had asked what to do when encountering such things.\n\nThe staff responsible for the aftermath had told her:\n\n\"When ordinary people encounter them, try to avoid confronting them directly.\"\n\n\"Hide if you can.\"\n\n\"The dirtier the hiding place, the better. For example, a rural dry toilet. Don't be afraid of the nausea; as long as you don't drown, just hide inside.\"\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent of monsters won't look for this place, or will subconsciously overlook such places.\"\n\n\"Even if they do look, there's a high chance they won't see you.\"\n\n\"Because human excrement can defile magic and obscure vision.\"\n\nAt this point, Dong Wenrui had a question: why ninety-nine percent?\n\nThe 749 staff member told her that some monsters originate from filth themselves, and others are not affected by this.\n\nFor instance.\n\nWild dog-type spirits.\n\nThinking of a dog's diet, Dong Wenrui understood instantly.\n\nUnlocking her phone, Dong Wenrui opened the chat window with the 749 staff member.\n\nShe had added this contact after the Dinghao Residential Area incident last time.\n\nShe had thought it wouldn't be useful in the future, only keeping it for peace of mind.\n\nWho would have thought she would seemingly encounter such a situation again?\n\nDong Wenrui understood that in this remote and dark place, if she ran haphazardly and her grandmother had indeed turned into a monster.\n\nThen she would only face a dead end.\n\nShe didn't believe she could outrun a monster.\n\nIt was better to find a place to hide and then inform 749 promptly.\n\nIf it really was a monster, it meant Grandma was already gone.\n\nIf not, then even better, a happy ending for all.\n\nBut this possibility couldn't be gambled on.\n\n[Sister Wang, I think I've encountered a monster again. Could you send someone to help me? I'm in Longyang City, Dongshan Village.....]\n\nA few seconds later, a message came back.\n\n[Hide well first. I'll check if there are any investigators near you. If not, I'll notify the local 749 investigators in Longyang to come.]\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nYunhai 749 Call Center.\n\nThe woman clicked open the specialized map, imported Dong Wenrui's location, and saw two crimson-purple red dots rapidly approaching Dongshan Village.\n\nClicking on them.\n\n[Official Investigator. Lu Ding]\n\n[Official Investigator. Bai Hemian]\n\nAt this moment, Dong Wenrui sent another message.\n\n[Sister Wang, I hear footsteps coming in.]\n\n[I hear my grandma calling me.]\n\n[I don't hear Blind Granny's voice. With my grandma's legs, there's no way she could have walked this far in such a short time......]\n\nThis information almost directly indicated that Dong Wenrui's grandmother had become a monster.\n\n[Don't be afraid, they'll be here soon.]\n\nLooking at the message on her phone.\n\nDong Wenrui's heart swelled with joy. The dim light illuminated her face, revealing a hint of the joy of surviving a catastrophe.\n\nAlthough she didn't know who \"they\" were, it was always good to have someone coming to save her.\n\nSuddenly.\n\nShe heard the footsteps stop, and her grandmother's calls also ceased.\n\nDong Wenrui looked up, terrified upon closer thought.\n\nShe saw the normally kind face smiling eerily and chillingly.\n\nTwisting her neck, tilting her head, sharp, heavily worn fangs were exposed on both sides of her mouth.\n\nUnder the dim light, the age spots on the old woman's face inexplicably multiplied.\n\n\"Rui Rui, Grandma found you.\"\n\nFear spread through her heart, just as it was about to surge up her throat.\n\nThe ceiling of the dry toilet was suddenly smashed through.\n\nCRASH!!!!",

Lu Ding couldn't even imagine how ridiculous he'd look flying while flailing his arms.\nExcuse me.\n\n*Extensive Records of the Taiping Era* recorded this monster.\n【In the summer of the 28th year of Kaiyuan, Supervisor Zhang of Ding Province was sitting outdoors with his wife at midnight when they heard something flying through the air... it was an old dog, red with sparse fur, a very long body, and very short legs, only about one or two inches long. Supervisor Zhang ordered it to be burned, deeply worried it was a monster...】\n\nThe general meaning is that one summer, Supervisor Zhang of Ding Province was playing with his wife in the courtyard.\nSuddenly, they heard something flying over.\nHe ordered people to chase it, and finally found that the thing looked like an old dog.\nIt was entirely red, with little fur, short legs, but a very long body; it was a complete deformity.\nLater, Supervisor Zhang, fearing the thing would cause trouble, ordered people to burn it.\n\nLu Ding, holding the Red Dog's head, looked at Dong Wenrui in the dry toilet.\nHe took a step back.\n\"This method is good, but unfortunately, your luck is bad.\"\n\nLooking up at Lu Ding, Dong Wenrui’s face showed surprise; memories intertwined in her mind.\n\"You're that one from last time, that one...\"\nLu Ding nodded: \"That's right, it was me last time, and it's me this time too.\"\n\"Come up quickly. I'm going to find Dead Granny; remember to hide well at home.\"\n\nLu Ding turned to leave.\nDong Wenrui quickly climbed up.\nMany things in her mind instantly became clear.\nShe had originally planned to tip them off.\nShe thought that if her grandma was a monster, since she hadn't attacked her for so many days prior, she wouldn't do so quickly now.\nEnough to last until the people from 749 arrived.\n\nWho would have thought...\nBut this wasn't the most crucial thing; the most crucial thing was that she had clearly asked Blind Granny to lead her grandma there.\nNow grandma has come here...\n\"Dead Granny, is that Blind Granny?\"\n\"No matter what she was called before, after tonight, she is Dead Granny.\"\n\nListening to Lu Ding's words, Dong Wenrui seemed to understand something.\nHer eyes gradually hardened.\nSo, Blind Granny was behind all of this!!\nLu Ding walked out and, with Bai Hemian, swept towards Blind Granny's house at the end of the village.\n\nAfter Dong Wenrui came out, she didn't stop, rushing directly into the house.\nShe rummaged through drawers and cupboards, finding the detonators and firearm her grandfather had left behind from his time guarding the mine.\nShe grabbed the items and ran towards the end of the village.\n\n....\n\nMeanwhile.\nThe old house at the end of Dongshan Village.\nThis was Blind Granny's residence.\nIn the small room, coil incense hung from the ceiling, emitting smoke, and various talismans were posted.\nDozens of spirit tablets were neatly arranged.\nThe topmost tablet was the spirit tablet of Ye Chengfeng from Dahei Mountain.\n\nBlind Granny approached with a handful of lit red incense sticks and placed them into the censer.\nShe placed Ye Li's spirit tablet.\n\"Old brother, thanks to you, I was able to escape back then. Now that you're gone, I don't have the ability to avenge you; I truly apologize.\"\n\"I couldn't protect the others for you either; I could only use this method to retrieve Xiao Li's fate, I hope you don't blame me.\"\n\"Back then, I predicted 'survival from certain death' for him, but now I don't know what's going on.\"\n\"Logically speaking, he shouldn't have died.\"\n\nThe old woman mumbled, then changed the subject.\n\"This girl, I think she's suitable for Xiao Li. Their fates are quite similar; I think they're a good match. Later...\"\n\nBefore she finished speaking.\nThe mud wall instantly crumbled.\nA figure rushed in, delivering a direct kick, sending Blind Granny flying to smash through the offering table.\nSpirit tablets flew up.\nLu Ding grabbed one tablet in each hand.\nThey were Ye Chengfeng's and Ye Li's, respectively.\n\nHe examined the spirit tablets in his hands.\nMimicking Blind Granny's tone, he said: \"This dead old hag, I think she's quite suitable for you, old dead man.\"\n\"Later, I'll send her down to you two; you could be considered a pair then. Both died by my hand, how fated!\"\n\nIn the corner, Blind Granny glared furiously.\n\"You are Lu Ding!!?\"\nLu Ding turned his head, a slightly eerie smile on his face: \"Since you know me... how dare you cause all this trouble behind my back?\"\n\"You, how badly do you want to die?\"\n\nBlind Granny's heart sank upon hearing this; she didn't understand, couldn't comprehend!\nWhy would Lu Ding find his way here!!!?\nShe pointed a hand, and the scissors, which had fallen to the ground, instantly shot towards Lu Ding.\nThe originally rusty scissors, as they sliced through the air, immediately shed their rust and became incredibly sharp.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand and tilted his head.\nYe Chengfeng's spirit tablet in his hand was instantly cut in half by the scissors.\nLu Ding shook the two halves of the tablet in his hand: \"You stabbed it yourself, huh?\"\nWith a squeeze, Ye Chengfeng's spirit tablet instantly shattered into dust.\n\n\"Lu Ding!\"\nLu Ding glanced at her: \"Angry, are we?\"\nHe raised Ye Li's spirit tablet in his hand again: \"Then will you be even angrier like this?\"\nWith a 'crunch,' Ye Li's spirit tablet also turned into powder.\nLu Ding's laughter rang out.\n\"Hahahahaha, this is the correct procedure. Dead people should stay put.\"\n\n\"I'll fight you to the death!\"\nBlind Granny let out a loud shout, her anger no longer controllable, and she flipped up.\nLu Ding moved as if teleporting, raising his leg and kicking directly.\nOne kick!!\nBang!!!\nBlind Granny's body smashed through the mud wall and tumbled into the courtyard.\nShe spat out a large mouthful of blood.\n\"What strength do you have to fight me? Now, I'll give you a chance to run. Remember, run that way.\"\n\nLu Ding pointed in a direction.\nIf it weren't for wanting to force her to run towards Changyan's old home, Lu Ding truly wouldn't have bothered with her.\nHe probably would have just beaten her to death in two punches.\nHearing this, Blind Granny clutched her injured chest and, with a miserable expression, pushed back with her legs, moving backward.\n\nSuch a scene.\nAt first glance, it made Lu Ding seem like the villain bullying an elderly person.\nSuddenly.\nBlind Granny felt something pressing against her back. She looked up.\nBai Hemian looked down: \"Don't you know your directions? I told you to go that way.\"\nAs he spoke, he kicked Blind Granny, sending her flying in the direction Lu Ding had pointed.\nHer body tumbled through the air, and she fell heavily to the ground.\nBy this point, Blind Granny also realized that these two were just toying with her, like a cat playing with a mouse.\n\nBut she had no other choice now.\nShe got up, glanced at the two, then turned and ran towards the darkness.\nLu Ding flew behind her, and Bai Hemian vanished into the darkness.\nNot long after.\nDong Wenrui arrived, carrying the firearm.",

Blind Granny, her body stiff, subtly glanced back.\n\nDarkness enveloped Bai Hemian's entire face.\n\nOnly his slightly excited, hiddenly manic eyes were visible, emitting an eerie green light.\n\n\"This is the spot.\"\n\nLu Ding's voice suddenly rang out.\n\nHe raised his right hand.\n\nAs the sound waves surged, a series of dull 'thump' sounds echoed.\n\nUnder the mobilization of spiritual energy, Lu Ding's heart was rapidly pumping, and along his spine, acupoints at precise intervals opened.\n\nFlesh Fiend Qi spewed forth from within.\n\nFinally, his elbows and shoulders, two major acupoints, fully opened, and black-red halos lit up.\n\nThat pair of inhuman eyes locked onto their target.\n\n\"Say goodbye to this world, old hag!!\"\n\nFlesh Fiend Qi from his elbow erupted in a tail flame over ten meters long, propelling his arm as he unleashed a punch!!\n\nBOOM!!!!\n\nTerrifying power, infused with spiritual energy, transformed into a sinister dragon, its grotesque phantom etched onto the ground by the moonlight as it charged forth.\n\nFierce winds tore at the wild grass and trees.\n\nThe earth shattered in an instant.\n\nLooking at the village entrance again, there was no trace of Blind Granny; pulling back the view, there wasn't even half a village left.\n\nOnly scattered rocks and yellow mud remained.\n\nLarge, shattered stones abruptly protruded from the ground.\n\nLu Ding's punch had crushed everything for nearly a thousand meters.\n\nLeaving a terrifying scar on the land.\n\nThis was his full power strike.\n\nHis acupoints closed, the halos vanished, and the lines on his face gradually receded.\n\nBai Hemian couldn't help but ponder this scene.\n\nIf Lu Ding's punch had been aimed at him, he... couldn't have blocked it.\n\nLu Ding himself hadn't expected the power of his punch to be so terrifying.\n\nAlright, now Lu Ding instantly knew how to deal with Minshan's Thousand Corpse Adoring King Formation.\n\n.....\n\nMinshan City.\n\nLocated at the border of Yunmeng.\n\nIt always experienced abundant rainfall.\n\nIt often saw water levels rise to dangerous levels during the rainy season.\n\nThis year, the levee directly burst, flooding many areas of Minshan City.\n\nAfter subsequent surveys and research.\n\nThe authorities decided to open a channel in the main river to build a dam.\n\nTo divert water for irrigation during droughts and to divert and release floodwaters during floods.\n\nAfter much searching, the best location was found to be where the Minshi Charity Mortuary was located.\n\nAnd it would have the least impact.\n\nBecause this place used to be a Charity Mortuary, there were basically no people nearby, making it the most convenient place to start.\n\nSo the authorities took the approval document and the drafted contract to the Charity Mortuary.\n\nOffering a relocation subsidy of one billion.\n\nThe official also promised, \"Since we're tearing yours down, we'll build you another one.\"\n\n\"At that time, all these graves and tombs will be moved over.\"\n\n\"You can continue to operate.\"\n\nThe people from the Charity Mortuary agreed, and everyone readily signed the contract.\n\nThen... some time ago, when construction began, they dug a bit, and lo and behold, underneath was hidden a Thousand Corpse Adoring King Formation.\n\nAnd it also coincidentally awakened the Thatched Hut Great Ghost, which the Charity Mortuary had transformed into.\n\nThe people from the Charity Mortuary saw this and exclaimed, \"Whoa, our ancestors even hid two such great treasures for us!\"\n\n\"Raise the price, must raise the price!!\"\n\nThey immediately started to haggle for a higher price.\n\nAs descendants of the Charity Mortuary, the Thatched Hut Great Ghost would not harm them, and only they could move the Thatched Hut Great Ghost.\n\nOthers going there wouldn't work.\n\nMinshan City wasn't a particularly large city to begin with.\n\nSimilar to Kaoshan City at the foot of Mount Dahei. So there was only one outpost here.\n\nRelying on just one outpost, it was almost impossible to take down the Thatched Hut Great Ghost and the Thousand Corpse Adoring King Formation.\n\nCharity Mortuary: \"We can help you move the Thatched Hut Great Ghost, a little service fee isn't too much, right?\"\n\nMinshan City Outpost: \"Pah!\"\n\nIf the outpost can't handle you, surely the branch bureau can, right?\n\nThey reported it directly upwards, and the branch bureau, seeing it, thought, \"Hey, a geomantic formation, perfect for trainees at the training ground to practice on, I'll report it upwards too.\"\n\nAnd so, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian arrived in Minshan.\n\nThere were no procedures, no messy formalities whatsoever.\n\nLu Ding just sent one message to the head of Minshan's 749 Outpost.\n\n[Prepare machinery for forced demolition]\n\nThe head of Minshan's 749 Outpost, upon receiving this message, was overjoyed.\n\n\"Haggling for a higher price, are we? Using your 'technical advantage' against us, are we!!!?\"\n\n\"Your comeuppance has arrived!!\"\n\n\"Quick, quick, Xiao Zhang, immediately call the local authorities, notify the construction team to prepare for entry, and get all machinery sent to the Charity Mortuary!!\"\n\n.....\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nNot far from the Minshi Charity Mortuary's main gate, Bai Hemian asked, \"What do you plan to do?\"\n\nLu Ding: \"How? Forced demolition, it must be forced demolition!\"\n\n\"The contract's signed, the money's received, the procedures are complete. Since I joined 749, I've never encountered something with such complete paperwork.\"\n\nLu Ding would do things without paperwork, so now that there's paperwork, why bother with extra talk?",

    "content": "While saying this, Lu Ding walked directly towards the funeral parlor's main gate.\n\nHe raised his leg, and kicked.\n\nBang!\n\nThe double-leaf wooden gate collapsed and shattered with a crash.\n\nWood splinters flew everywhere.\n\nLu Ding's voice echoed through the mortuary.\n\n\"You have two hours. Move what needs to be moved, and get out. This place is being demolished now!\"\n\nAs Lu Ding's words fell, coupled with the gate being smashed, the people inside the mortuary were immediately alarmed.\n\nOne by one, they darted out, looking at Lu Ding with unfriendly expressions.\n\nFrom within the crowd, a young man walked out.\n\nLooking at the gate, which was shattered into pieces, Jiao Yu raised his eyes and looked at Lu Ding, asking in a cold tone, \"Who are you?\"\n\nLu Ding had no good feelings whatsoever for the people of this mortuary; they were \"nail households,\"* what good feelings could he have?\n\nBut he was here to handle business, and the necessary procedures still had to be followed. Even the Kou family had to follow procedures. And the funeral parlor people had already signed a contract. You can't just start fighting as soon as you arrive, can you? Moreover, his target this time was the Great Ghost of the Thatched Cottage, and the Thousand Corpses Bowing to the King formation. It wasn't aimed at the people of the mortuary. But if they weren't sensible, Lu Ding wouldn't mind incidentally teaching them a lesson.\n\nHis identity card was flashed.\n\n\"749 Investigator, Lu Ding.\"\n\nLu Ding...\n\nJiao Yu thought for a moment.\n\nHmm... never heard of him.\n\nAfter all, Minshan City was just a small city. Although he was also a Qi Refiner, he lived in a remote corner, so how could he know about the internal workings of 749? Even if Lu Ding's name had been spreading rapidly in Yunmeng recently, that was only among the children of prominent families. And it had only been a few days, so it wouldn't have reached here. This rogue cultivator of his didn't even deserve to hear Lu Ding's name.\n\nIt was precisely because of this that Jiao Yu's tone was unfriendly: \"Minshan 749 has never heard of a person like you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he actually reached out to snatch the ID from Lu Ding's hand.\n\nMy heavens.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand and dodged. The look he cast was incredibly shocked. What did he see?! Lu Ding could hardly believe his eyes. Someone actually dared to snatch a 749 ID? One must know that a 749 ID and body camera are almost equivalent to a police officer's gun. An investigator showing their ID is like a police officer firing a warning shot. Snatching an ID is like snatching a gun. Are people's guts this big now?!\n\nLu Ding originally thought it would be hard to encounter such a \"simpleton\"** in reality. But today, he actually encountered one. The people he had met before, their minds worked incredibly fast. They were either old foxes or young foxes. Each of them demonstrated the wisdom of adapting to circumstances to the fullest. Now, encountering such a hothead, Lu Ding truly hadn't expected it.\n\nSeeing him dodge and not show his ID, Jiao Yu became even more agitated.\n\n\"What do you mean by this?!\"\n\n\"Are you afraid for me to see?\"\n\nLook, he even dared to ask Lu Ding what he meant? Lu Ding already disliked this mortuary; they signed a contract and then tried to inflate the price***. Now you even dare to snatch his ID? Seeing the strange smile on Lu Ding's face, Jiao Yu was just about to ask why he was smiling, but before the words left his mouth, he saw Lu Ding raise his hand without saying a word. Swiftly, accurately, and ruthlessly, he grabbed him, lifted him up, and slammed him hard onto the stone slab floor of the mortuary. With his cheek making intimate contact with the ground, and the terrifying force applied, Jiao Yu's head immediately split open and bled. He felt as if his brains were about to be scrambled. With blood overflowing from his mouth and nose, he instantly fell unconscious on the spot.\n\n\"Senior Brother!!!!!\"\n\n\"Brother Feng!!!!!\"\n\n\"Quickly let go of my Senior Brother!!!!\"\n\nHearing the clamor in his ears, Lu Ding put a finger to his lips: \"Shhh!\"\n\n\"Don't be noisy, it's annoying. Now, because of him, you have one and a half hours to move your things.\"\n\n\"After one and a half hours, anyone who hasn't left will be obstructing official duties.\"\n\n\"You are going too far!\" a woman's voice rang out.\n\nLu Ding looked in the direction of the voice. An old man in white and a young woman in green walked over. The one who spoke earlier was the young woman in green. Listening to her words, Lu Ding found it a bit amusing.\n\nBai Hemian, who was behind him, saw this. He took a few steps forward and stood level with Lu Ding. \"This is how we do things.\"\n\nLu Ding spread his hands, silently assenting that his words were his own meaning.\n\n\"If you are dissatisfied, you are welcome to attack me.\"\n\n\"If you have an objection, you are welcome to file a complaint.\"\n\n\"The contract is here, in black and white. You took the money, and you signed the papers.\"\n\n\"Now the land is ours, and the building is ours. Giving you one and a half hours is already very merciful of me.\"\n\n\"You...\" The young woman in green still wanted to say something. The old man next to her stopped her. He had already seen that these two were fearless and, with such actions, must have come prepared. He said with a chuckle: \"Investigator, isn't one and a half hours a bit too short? We can't move everything....\"\n\n\"Can't move everything?\" Lu Ding repeated the phrase before replying: \"What does not being able to move everything have to do with me?\"\n\nYou've had the contract for so long, what were you doing all this time? And you still have time to chat with me now, \"can't move everything\"? Today, whether you can move it all or not, you still have to move. This tactic of delaying time doesn't work with Lu Ding. There was plenty of time before. Now you tell me you can't move everything?\n\nThe old man's face turned somewhat unpleasant. Nie Qingfei, standing nearby, couldn't help herself. \"You are going too far.\"\n\nLu Ding frowned. Is this person's brain not working right? He's going too far? He didn't try to inflate the price. It wasn't him who snatched someone else's ID. Where is he going too far?\n\n\"Alright, nail household who tried to inflate the price, shut your mouth. If you say one more word to me,\" Lu Ding said, pointing at the unconscious Jiao Yu on the ground, \"I guarantee you'll be just like him in the next second.\"\n\nNie Qingfei, after all, had grown some sense. The old man beside her, his expression changing, spoke: \"Investigator, are you sure you want to do things this way?\"\n\nLu Ding slightly raised his head: \"Yes, so what do you want?\"\n\nThe old man said nothing more: \"Alright then, we don't need an hour and a half, we'll leave immediately.\"\n\nHe was old and had experienced much. It was impractical to go against 749. All they wanted was a price increase. Now that 749 had sent people expressing a tough stance, if they continued to hold out, it would be disrespecting 749. In the old man's heart, he didn't believe Lu Ding and Bai Hemian could solve the Great Ghost of the Thatched Cottage and the Thousand Corpses Bowing to the King formation. After all, even the head of the Minshan City 749 branch couldn't solve it. These two young people? Heh... Sometimes, backing down wasn't a bad thing. It was fine to let them try; if they succeeded, they'd get a billion. If they failed, the mortuary could continue to inflate the price. No matter what, it was a win-win, profitable either way.\n\nAlthough the old man understood clearly and could control his emotions, Nie Qingfei, who went to help Jiao Yu, had somewhat forgotten Lu Ding's earlier words. She was seen helping Jiao Yu up. Seeing her junior brother in such a miserable state, Nie Qingfei's anger surged. She glared at Lu Ding, and coldly snorted, \"We're not done yet. You'd better be able to resolve the issues here, otherwise...\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding immediately turned around, his hand forming a claw, and he grabbed Nie Qingfei, lifting her up.\n\n---\n*   **Nail households (釘子戶 - dīngzihù):** Property owners who refuse to vacate their homes or businesses to make way for development, often demanding exorbitant compensation.\n**   **Simpleton (半糖 - bàntáng):** Literally \"half sugar.\" A modern slang term often implying someone is naive, a bit dense, or \"not fully there\" in terms of common sense.\n***   **Inflate the price (坐地起價 - zuòdìqǐjià):** To raise the price while already in a position to sell, often unfairly or opportunistically.",

    "content": "So fast, no one could react in time.\n\nNo one expected him to suddenly strike.\n\nThe cyan figure, once lifted, was slammed heavily onto the ground.\n\nBang!!!\n\nThe floor tiles shattered.\n\nSeeing her unconscious amidst the shattered tiles and rubble, Lu Ding lowered his head, his expression cold: \"I just told you, if you said one more word, I'd make you like him.\"\n\n\"Xiao Fei!!\"\n\nThe old man shouted loudly.\n\nAll his experience, all his age, all his composure, at this moment, vanished completely.\n\nHe only had this one granddaughter.\n\nNow, with his granddaughter beaten right in front of him, Nie Huasheng could no longer bear it. His cultivation exploded, and his aura soared to the heavens.\n\n\"Get lost, you brat!!\"\n\nThe old man circulated his Qi in both palms, a cyan glow adhering to them, within which one could discern towering mountains and lush, dripping greenery.\n\nA palm strike came forth.\n\nLu Ding raised his palm to meet it.\n\nBang!!!\n\nAs their bare palms collided, a visible wave of Qi rolled outwards.\n\nLu Ding raised an eyebrow, surprised in his heart. This old man's physical body was quite interesting.\n\nAmong humans, of all the Qi Refiners he had fought, this old man's physical body was the strongest.\n\nIf Lu Ding hadn't obtained the Pump Heart Flesh Fiend Method, relying only on his original Bear-Grizzly Strength, he might not have been able to defeat this old man.\n\nBut now...\n\n\"Assaulting a 749 Investigator, old man, you're finished.\"\n\nLu Ding applied a second burst of force.\n\nStepping forward.\n\nHe pushed the old man back, causing him to continuously retreat. The bluestones beneath his feet shattered inch by inch, and his face flushed red.\n\n\"What a pity. You're only at the Divine Palace Realm. If you were at the Life Bestowal Realm cultivation, with this physical body, you might genuinely make me fight seriously!\"\n\nA surge of suppressed anger was stifled in his heart.\n\nNie Huasheng had words he couldn't speak, not daring to open his mouth easily, fearing it would dissipate his physical body's Qi.\n\nHe really wanted to say!\n\nWhat do you mean 'I'm only at the Divine Palace Realm'!\n\nAren't you also at the Divine Palace Realm!!!?\n\nIn the instant their palms met, Nie Huasheng had already probed and realized Lu Ding was also at the Divine Palace Realm.\n\nHis heart was utterly shocked.\n\nOne must know, the cultivation method he practiced was very special. Its main focus was longevity, and the longer he lived, the stronger he became.\n\nIt wasn't restricted by lifespan, growing his physical body, talent, and realm.\n\nNor would his functions weaken due to old age.\n\nHe began cultivating this method at thirty years old, and this year he was seventy-five.\n\nA full forty-five years, just to reach his current strength. Yet, this young man, who looked no older than twenty...\n\n...with a single palm strike, negated his forty-five years of arduous cultivation!!\n\nAlthough this cultivation method itself was slow to cultivate, requiring patience.\n\nBut he had endured for forty-five years, only to be beaten to this state by a twenty-year-old youth!!\n\nAn inexplicable surge of jealous fury welled up in Nie Huasheng's heart.\n\nHis eyes quickly became bloodshot.\n\nHis aura transformed, shifting from its original peaceful and upright, life-filled quality to extreme savagery, brimming with malevolence.\n\nSeeing this.\n\nLu Ding drew back his hand.\n\nOn his great spinal dragon, a Qi point opened.\n\nBoom!!!\n\nBlack and red halos flashed, he raised his fist, accumulating power!!!\n\nNie Huasheng, seeing this, instantly retreated with almost no thought.\n\nThen, a stone tablet descended from the sky.\n\nBang!!!!\n\nEngraved upon it were large characters: \"Stone, Dare, Assume!!!\"*\n\nA terrifying suppressive force directly pinned Nie Huasheng to the ground, rendering him unable to move. The demonic quality in his eyes gradually receded.\n\nHe opened his mouth and questioned, in an incomprehensible tone: \"Weren't you going to throw a punch!!!?\"\n\n\"Can't I use a spell just because I'm throwing a punch?\"\n\nLu Ding retorted.\n\nOld Man Nie's expression froze.\n\nHis face, suppressed, flushed so red it was almost purple.\n\nHis rationality was under assault. He had thought Lu Ding was accumulating power for a punch, and seeing his terrifying aura, Nie Huasheng dared not resist it head-on.\n\nHe had wanted to evade.\n\nAs a result, that punch directly fizzled out. What suppressed him was actually this stone tablet, conjured by a spell at some unknown moment!!!\n\nDefeated, Nie Huasheng wasn't angry. At his advanced age, having practiced this cultivation method, he had been defeated countless times before.\n\nBut to be defeated in *this* manner, he was practically dying of anger!!\n\nWith his rationality in disarray, he subconsciously asked: \"When did you make the hand seals?\"\n\nThis question, Bai Hemian answered for Lu Ding.\n\n\"Hand seals?\"\n\n\"He never makes hand seals. When he's happy, whatever he calls for comes. When he's unhappy, whatever he thinks of comes.\"\n\nAt this, Nie Huasheng finally understood.\n\nHe had been played for a fool!!!\n\n\"Argh!!!! You brat, do you dare let me up!!\"\n\nAs he spoke, crimson veins streaked through the old man's eyes.\n\nHe showed signs of falling into depravity and blackening again.\n\nBut this trend had just begun.\n\nLu Ding went up and aimed a War Stomp right at Nie Huasheng's exposed head beneath the stone tablet.\n\nHe forcefully stomped out the crimson veins in his eyes.\n\n\"Depravity! Bang! Blacken! Bang! Get up! Bang!\"\n\nOne word, one kick; a few more kicks followed.\n\nAlright, the old man stopped shouting.\n\nHe just looked a bit miserable, but the vitality in his body was still very strong.\n\nLu Ding stopped kicking, looking at the drowsy old man. Now, it was right.\n\nAt the moment the old man fell into depravity, he was indeed a little surprised.\n\nBut only for a moment.\n\nLu Ding then reacted. They all say that turning good weakens one by three points, while turning evil strengthens one tenfold.\n\nBut there's a prerequisite.\n\nThere's a wind-up.\n\nTo perform something with a wind-up in front of him, wasn't that just asking for a beating?\n\nHis spells, on the other hand, had no wind-up; they were all instant casts.\n\nJust then, Nie Huasheng's fresh blood seeped into the ground.\n\nBeneath the trembling earth, at the center of the ancestral hall, the thatched hut inexplicably grew limbs, crawling out from underground, leaving a pit.\n\nBlack mist spread from within.\n\n\"Roar!!!\"\n\nAmidst its sky-splitting roar.\n\nLu Ding said to Bai Hemian beside him: \"Make him watch closely.\"\n\nBai Hemian stepped forward, squatted down, and grabbed Nie Huasheng's hair, forcing him to directly face the recently emerged Thatched Hut Great Ghost.\n\n\"Is this the leverage you used to raise your prices?\"\n\nFacing Bai Hemian's words, Nie Huasheng laughed wretchedly.\n\n\"Cough, cough, arrogant brats, you will regret this, if...\"\n\nSlap!!\n\nBai Hemian slapped him across the face.\n\n\"I asked if this was your leverage. You only need to answer yes or no. Why are you spouting nonsense?\"\n\nNie Huasheng spat out a mouthful of blood: \"So what if it is?\"\n\nBai Hemian twisted his face into a bizarre smile: \"Then you just watch how your leverage disappears.\"\n\nHe turned his head away.\n\nAnd saw Lu Ding's body radiate with intense black and red halos.\n\nAs his Qi points opened.\n\nFlesh Fiend Qi spewed and swept from them, like smoke signals soaring to the sky.\n\nBeneath the soul-shaking waves of sound.\n\nLu Ding drew back his fist, accumulating power.\n\nThe scenery around his body seemed to be pulled and distorted by him.\n\nDrawing back his fist was like drawing a bow, unleashing it was like firing an arrow.\n\nHe threw a punch.\n\nBoom!!!!\n\nVisible even more clearly in broad daylight, as the black and red Flesh Fiend Qi spewed forth, a Sinister Dragon coiled and charged, and fierce winds howled between heaven and earth.\n\nBlack and red flashed, replacing the colors of heaven and earth, as if the scene was glitching, flickering between light and dark.\n\nHouses were utterly destroyed, the earth cracked open.\n\nMud and stone slabs, some as small as a few meters, others as large as dozens of meters, protruded, forming a path nearly a thousand meters long and a hundred meters wide, the trace of the Sinister Dragon's movement.\n\nThe Thatched Hut Great Ghost, which had just appeared and was still roaring incessantly...\n\n...was instantly shattered into dust by the Sinister Dragon, scattering fragments everywhere.\n\nIn the end, it vanished without even letting out a single cry.\n\nThe old man stared blankly at this scene.\n\nLu Ding turned his head and looked at him.\n\n\"Old man, half of your leverage is gone.\"\n\n---\n*  **石敢當 (Shí Gǎndāng)**: A stone tablet or carving, often placed at crossroads or against buildings in Chinese folk belief, intended to ward off evil spirits and protect against negative influences.

    "content": "......\n\nWhat does it mean to kill by striking at the heart? This is killing by striking at the heart.\n\nThe Thatched Hut Ghost, on which the old man had placed such high hopes, merely showed its head before it was gone.\n\nAnd it was an instant kill in one move.\n\nSuch a huge Thatched Hut Ghost!!!\n\nNie Huasheng really couldn't understand how someone so young could possess such power.\n\nAnd how could such a person come to a small place like Minshan City?\n\nThere are no treasures here.\n\nCould it be just to deal with our own Graveyard?\n\nYou should have said something earlier!\n\nIf you had said earlier that such a person would come.\n\nWhy would I have tried to raise the price?\n\nWouldn't a perfectly good Thatched Hut Ghost be better used for guarding the estate?\n\nNow it's just gone, not even a speck left.\n\nI was beaten, my apprentice was beaten, and my granddaughter was also beaten.\n\nWas all this really necessary!!!\n\nUsing an ox-slaughtering knife to kill a chicken.*\n\nIt's not like we weren't cooperating!!\n\nAt this moment, Nie Huaqing was on the verge of tears.\n\nNearby.\n\nLu Ding was checking the rewards dropped by the Thatched Hut Ghost.\n\n[Contained Monster: Thatched Hut Ghost]\n\n[Containment Reward: Pillory Execution]\n\n[Pillory Execution: Erect a copper pillar in a fiery hall, perform the pillory torture.]\n\nPillory Execution......\n\nLu Ding looked at these four characters, feeling strange in his heart. Why were his techniques all so... villainous?\n\nHe then looked at the four characters 'Thatched Hut Ghost'.\n\nThis type of thing was recorded in both *Miscellaneous Tales of the Strange* and *Baopuzi*.\n\nTo take what's relevant to the pillory torture.\n\n[In the late Shang Dynasty, the common people resented [King] Zhou while feudal lords rebelled. Thus, Zhou intensified penal laws, instituting the method of pillory torture. Later, it spread to various states, where it was modified: a copper pillar was erected in a thatched hut, and guilty individuals were made to climb it, often falling into burning charcoal and being burned alive... Fire was used to ignite the hut, burning their sins with fire and their bodies with grass...]\n\nThe general meaning is that in the late Shang Dynasty, the common people resented King Zhou, and the feudal lords betrayed him.\n\nKing Zhou became enraged and intensified punishments, creating the pillory execution.\n\nA large iron pillar would be heated red-hot, and anyone causing trouble would be tied to it. Later, this punishment spread to some barbaric small states.\n\nThose small states imitated it.\n\nHowever, a grand hall was too extravagant for them, so they built a thatched hut and erected a pillar inside.\n\nThey also said that criminals were unworthy of punishment in a grand hall; from the moment they committed a crime, their status and life became as cheap as thatch.\n\nThen people were tied to the pillar inside the thatched hut and set alight.\n\nThe hut and the person perished together.\n\nLater, the foundation of this hut, where people had been burned, saw the hut rebuilt and people burned again and again. And those burned were always grave criminals, most of whom had extraordinary status.\n\nOrdinary people weren't even deemed worthy of this punishment.\n\nOver time, this thatched hut, imbued with intense resentment, became the Thatched Hut Ghost.\n\nOf course, there were other different theories, but those others weren't related to the pillory torture.\n\nContinuing with the present.\n\nAlthough it truly didn't seem like something good people would use.\n\nBut Lu Ding didn't say he disliked it. When this thing is used, it will definitely be very shocking.\n\nLater, I'll dig out the Corpse King from that Thousand Corpses Serving the King Formation and test the waters with it.\n\nSuddenly, Nie Huasheng's voice interrupted Lu Ding's thoughts.\n\n\"Investigator, esteemed Investigator, I can help you dismantle the Thousand Corpses Serving the King Formation, we can........\"\n\n\"Make him shut up.\"\n\nLu Ding found it annoying to listen to.\n\nDo I need your help?\n\nWho asked you?\n\nHow laughable.\n\nIf the Thousand Corpses Serving the King Formation is dismantled, where would Lu Ding find a monster to test 'Pillory Execution'?\n\nCould it be that I'd use your old bones to test it?\n\nNie Huasheng, having his words interrupted, felt indignant. With things having developed to this point, no matter how old he was, he could see that the Thousand Corpses Serving the King Formation would absolutely not cause any trouble for the young man before him.\n\nHis terrifying power was enough to flatten the entire Graveyard.\n\nWhat Thousand Corpses Serving the King?\n\nIt would probably just be a matter of one punch in the end.\n\nThat's why Nie Huasheng was eager to prove himself, hoping to redeem himself by performing meritorious service.\n\nBut in the end, Lu Ding simply wouldn't listen.\n\nBai Hemiao, with his single-minded brain, heard Lu Ding's words and didn't give it any thought.\n\nHe raised his hand, condensing corpse qi into a blade.\n\nWith a direct chop, the head flew into the sky.\n\nLu Ding turned his head to look: \"You........\"\n\nBai Hemiao: \"Huh???\"\n\nLu Ding's expression was helpless: \"Never mind.\"\n\nKilled him, killed him, nothing more to say. He deserved to die anyway. Attacking a 749 Investigator performing official duties is no small crime.\n\nIf Lu Ding truly only possessed the strength of an ordinary resident Investigator.\n\nThen that old man's palm strike just now would have left Lu Ding dead or crippled.\n\n....\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nLu Ding had just set his sights on the Corpse King.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nYunmeng.\n\nThe Yu Family.\n\nThe Water Marsh Family's ancestors were originally fishermen. Later, they accidentally found a *Water-Avoiding Golden Gaze Art* in the water.\n\nCoupled with their innate talent.\n\nThe gears of destiny began to turn, and a new star among Yunmeng's Qi Practitioner families steadily rose.\n\nDeveloping continuously until today.\n\nWith over a thousand family members.\n\nHowever, passed down to this generation, there are only four direct descendants.\n\nTwo boys and two girls.\n\nThe youngest among them, Yu Chen, was even Yunmeng's famous playboy, or to put it nicely, a profligate son.\n\nJust now, Yu Chen was here admiring flowers and teasing birds.\n\nA maid in a maid outfit hurried over.\n\nShe hadn't even reached the young man yet.\n\nHe twitched his nose, deliberately taking a deep breath and making a sound.\n\n\"So fragrant, it must be Xiangxiang, right? Come let young master have a good sniff.\"\n\n\"Oh, young master, stop messing around. News came from Min's Graveyard that a 749 Investigator came to demand a forced demolition.\"\n\nListening to Xiangxiang's words, Yu Chen was unmoved: \"If they're demolishing, then demolish. They signed the contract and took the money, so it should have been demolished anyway.\"\n\n\"But the person who went injured Nie Qingfei and killed Nie Huasheng.\"\n\nHearing this, the young man's expression sobered, his demeanor changed, and there was no longer any trace of his usual profligate appearance.\n\nHe asked with a magnetic voice.\n\n\"Did they injure someone I have my eye on?\"\n\n\"Quite daring. They shouldn't be from around here, should they?\"\n\n\"The local 749 can't handle the Thatched Hut Ghost and the Thousand Corpses Serving the King Formation. It must be someone from the Provincial 749 Branch Headquarters. Do you know who it is? Are there any photos?\"\n\nXiangxiang looked at Yu Chen's serious expression.\n\nThe smile never left her face.\n\nThis was the young master she liked the most; his reputation as a profligate was merely a disguise.\n\nXiangxiang shook her head: \"I don't know who it is. The news came from Xiao Qi, your subordinate whom you bribed at the Graveyard. I asked him these questions too, but he hasn't replied to me.\"\n\nYu Chen stood up, patting away the creases on his long robe.\n\n\"Since that's the case, then I won't go, lest the person who came is some formidable existence.\"\n\nAt this point, Yu Chen changed his tone: \"But since they touched someone I have my eye on, I'll have to weigh them, see what they're made of, and if they're worthy enough.\"\n\n\"Go and inform Old Shui to make a trip to Min's Graveyard to demand an explanation. But be careful to adapt your approach to the person you're dealing with.** If they're someone we can't afford to provoke, then butter them up.\"\n\n\"Say some good words and bring Qingfei back.\"\n\n\"If we can afford to provoke them, then teach him a lesson; hit back exactly how he hit. Remember to be in the right, don't leave any grounds for dispute, and absolutely do not kill an Investigator.\"\n\nHere, Yu Chen was giving orders to his subordinates.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nMin's Graveyard.\n\nLu Ding changed his standing position.\n\nWith someone under his foot, and a phone in his hand.\n\nHe pressed the phone's unlock screen, leaned down, and said, \"Taking a candid photo of me?\"\n\n\"Come on, unlock it. Let me see.\"\n\nIt turned out that just a moment ago, Lu Ding was about to head to the area where the Thousand Corpses Serving the King Formation was located.\n\nSuddenly, a blinding white light flashed. In the crowd, a plain-looking young man was holding up his phone, taking a candid photo of him.\n\nYou want to take a candid photo, fine.\n\nBut you didn't even turn off the flash.\n\nSo I found you, didn't I?\n\nLu Ding flashed over, and *smack*, pinned him right there.\n***\n*   Lit. \"Using an ox-slaughtering knife to kill a chicken.\" An idiom meaning to use excessive force or overkill for a task.\n**   Lit. \"See people, serve dishes.\" An idiom meaning to tailor one's approach or words to the specific individual being dealt with.",

    "content": "The boy was panicked in his eyes, and he just saw it with his own eyes. This man beat Brother Jiao with one move, and then turned over Master Jie with another move.\n\nFinally, the town pressed the teacher\n\nWhat he originally wanted to say was, \"This is my mobile phone, I have the right not to show you.\"\n\nBut the exit becomes: \"Digital Code 9527\"\n\nShuding presses the mobile phone, and paddles the chat software\n\nWith the flip of the chat record, Yu Jun, the name Yu Jian, entered the vision of the tripod.\n\nThe circle of 金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金金� \n\nThis is Yun Meng. The activities of the Sun Ding have always been in Yunhai.\n\nHe hadn't paid special attention to it, of course he didn't know that this was a famous slut of Yun Meng, Yu Jun\n\nBut I saw the content on the chat\n\nThe Sun Ding probably understood a little. Yu Jun is the direct descendant of the Yun Meng Yu family, one of the only two male members.\n\nA dream gathering meeting of Qishi, and the still-stirring Qingfei accidentally met this Yu Jun\n\nMaybe it was because of his long appearance or other reasons, Yu Jun was deeply attracted by the Qingfei.\n\nThat's what the chat records say anyway\n\nThen Yu Jun led this \"Little Liuzi\" to eat, drink and have fun, so that he could watch Xiao Qingfei, so that he would not let other men get closer.\n\nRemember to send him a message at any time\n\nProbably that's it\n\nJust now, this little Liuzi was sending a letter to Yu Jun and taking a photo of a tripod with a secret photo.\n\nWho knows that he doesn't turn off the lights, it's stupid\n\nSo stupid that even the Ding is worth complaining\n\nSeeing that he should have read it almost, Xiao Liuzi asked in a short voice: \"Can I leave?\"\n\n\"You can take a sneak shot of the 749 investigator to perform the business, but you still want to leave.\"\n\n\"I'll wait for you, wait until the people from the Gushan City Institute come. I'll go here to study for a month and recite the rules for the management of the Qishi.\"\n\nIt's not enough to kill it. They just want to take a photo, but they're just a dog-legged that has not yet been formed.\n\nIt's not bad, I can discipline it\n\nThis is talking about Cao Cao, Cao Cao will be here\n\nA figure came\n\nHe was so tall that he was wearing a light bubble on his head, and his light reflected under the sun\n\nThe visitor is the director of the 749th House in Gushan City, Rentong\n\n\"Hahahahahahahahaha, I'll wait for you. My name is Rentong. I guess the two of them are famous. Two investigators, including the Taishen Ding of Yunhai Jielang and the Bai Yumian, are you?\"\n\nBold and generous\n\nThis is the first impression of this elder\n\nHe stepped forward and shook hands: \"Hello, Master Ren.\"\n\nAs for Bai Yumian, there are few words, just say hello if you click the head\n\nRentong shook hands with Yu Ding, his eyes unconsciously watching the whole scene\n\nWhen he saw the Tsubasaki corpse for the first two minutes, he first looked at the Ding, and finally his eyes fell on Bai Yumian.\n\nAccording to the information on the information, the one who is active should not be the Ding.\n\nIf it is a lunar tripod, it will not only fall off the brain, it should be Bai Yumian\n\nThinking of this, he saw the place where there should be a big thatched hut.\n\nNow there is only a mess left, with the terrifying traces of nearly a thousand meters in the past\n\nSeeing these, Rentong's face was surprised to express his feelings.\n\nThis\n\nIt should be the handwriting of the Sun DingAccording to the data in the bureau, the damage caused by him is generally greater if he acts.\n\nBut this has nothing to do with it, it's all going to be removed anyway\n\nAs for the problem of Huasheng\n\nRentong believes that the lunar calendar should explain\n\nJust when he thought of this, Ru Ding said, \"Sir Ren, you will connect the law recorder, and this person will hit the investigator.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahaha, okay, thank the mainland investigators for supporting my work\"\n\nJust the first side, Rentong's favorability for the steed is instantly increased\n\nWhen people come out of the place of cultivation, it is almost like a special mission\n\nIf you show me the Dharma recorder, it will give you face. If you don’t show me the Dharma recorder, it should be\n\nBecause the law records of the lunar tripod, some specialists will watch it after they go back.\n\nNow I've seen it for Rentong\n\nIt's just that he can write a report in the future, which will save a lot of process and effort.\n\n\"Cooperate with each other, since you are here, I will solve the Qianlang Gongwang Bureau first.\"\n\nRentong turned around and told other investigators who had just followed him: \"Maintain order and control the situation.\"\n\nAfter saying that, he said to the Ding, \"The investigator, I will accompany you. If there is anything, I can help you.\"\n\n\"I also know the situation here. If you have any, please ask me.\"\n\n\"And recently, your affairs are so badly here in Yunmeng.\"\n\nI'm interested in this tripod\n\nHis affairs were, but last time he called Blue Mingrong, letting him come back to help the prosecutor\n\nShu Ding asked, \"How big is it?\"\n\nHe is looking forward to how Blue Mingrong will be promoted to him\n\nIt is normal for the Yi Zhu people not to know it, but the director of the 749 Institute knows it, and it is also normal.\n\n\"Now, the last five are basically not showing up on the talent list. They know they can't beat you.\"\n\n\"Only the previous few were still dancing outside, they all let it go.\"\n\n\"You want you to get to Yunmeng, at any time or place, you can choose, but there is a little bit.\"\n\nThis kind of eyebrows and big eyes will also be sold by Guanzi\n\nYue Ding cooperated with him and became a supporting actor: \"Oh, what's the point?\"\n\n\"You don't accumulate energy and get hit hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\n\nRentong laughed out loud\n\nThe Ding laughed as he heard it\n\nIt seems that these people only understand his way of cart\n\nBut that's true. He is famous for his skill, and should be good at it.\n\nBut if they all have to accumulate energy when they beat them, the Sun Ding can't afford to destroy that person\n\n\"I also heard it once, I don't want to use any specific means in terms of fighting.\"\n\nRentong added a sentence\n\nShu Ding continued: \"Is it not said in other people's rules that it is better not to kill anyone?\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, right. If your thing collapses for a while, Si Ming can't even hold back. If they collapse, will it be wiped out? Hahahahaha?\"\n\nRentong smiled inexplicably\n\nAlthough it sounds ridiculous\n\nBut Rentong also thinks that if it is a comparison of the superiority and inferiority, it is not about life and death. The trick of the Sun Ding is definitely not used.\n\nIt's not that he's turning his elbow out, helping outsiders and not helping 749's colleagues.\n\nIt's just a very strange feeling. Once the Sun Ding uses this trick, it means that adults beat children.\n\nInexplicably unfairOf course, these ideas are all the previous ones. Now, when Rentong saw the horror traces on the earth\n\nHe dared to remain calm, this was definitely not left by the famous slaughter of the dynasty\n\nso\n\nIt's not necessary to hit, but I don't say I can't use this trick. In the end, the adults beat the child\n\nThis mother's\n\nWhy is the gap between people so big\n\nRentong looked at the Ding with curious eyes\n\n\"It's okay, if you don't need it, don't need it.\"\n\nThe answer was that he had other skills without using a car.\n\nThe prize must be taken from others. This small requirement is not too much in the eyes of the Ding. After all, the thing is accumulated, it is a fatal thing.\n\nEven if it is light, it is missing a leg",

    "content": "...\n\nMoreover, agreeing to this request was like gaining leverage. I've already agreed to you, so you can't possibly go back on your word, can you?\n\nIf they still dared to renege, then in the future, the reputation of Yunmeng as a place, throughout the entire Qi Cultivator circle of Great Han...\n\nWouldn't even be served at the children's table.\n\nThey'd have to sit with the dogs.\n\nThe two chatted as they walked towards the location of the Thousand Corpses Arching the King formation.\n\nOriginally, the wild graveyard where the Thousand Corpses Arching the King formation was located and the Boneyard were supposed to be separated by a small hill.\n\nBut Lu Ding's punch earlier not only shattered the Boneyard by more than half, but also destroyed the small hill along with it.\n\nSo, a flat path now stretched for several hundred meters.\n\nLooking further down, it was a desolate wilderness of solitary graves, a ten-li* deserted area.\n\nThis was the location of the Thousand Corpses Arching the King formation.\n\nIt was morning now.\n\nThe sun was already high, but even so, standing outside the graveyard, a chilling wind still whistled, making one's entire body feel cold.\n\nThis situation was enough to glimpse a hint of the danger within.\n\nIf it was like this in broad daylight, then at night, if a living person went in, they'd go in and never make a sound.\n\nRen Tong said from the side, \"Previously, this place had a certain reputation, but it wasn't this outrageous. We didn't even know there was a Thousand Corpses Arching the King formation here; it didn't manifest.\"\n\n\"Once we went in to check the situation, luck, that thing, can be good or bad.\"\n\n\"We went straight to the Corpse King's Tomb deep inside.\"\n\nThat luck was indeed hard to describe. If you say the luck was good, you found the Corpse King's Tomb. If you say the luck was bad, in such a vast place, you somehow precisely located the invisible Corpse King's Tomb.\n\nLu Ding said, \"Normal. Feng Shui, that thing, has overt and hidden aspects. The overt is obvious at a glance. The hidden remains dormant until it activates, then it's astounding.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Ren Tong said, gesturing as he spoke.\n\n\"When we got there, the ground was actually smoking, seriously, actual smoke, the kind ordinary people could see with their naked eyes.\"\n\n\"Well, as the director of the Minshan City Outpost, someone as important as me, I definitely felt something was wrong, so I took a shovel and poked at it a few times.\"\n\n\"Still with a shovel?\" Lu Ding interjected.\n\n\"You bet! Blasting it directly wouldn't be proper. Who doesn't have a grave somewhere? We still had to follow the proper procedures.\"\n\nA quick assessment: this was also a person who valued proper conduct.\n\nRen Tong continued, \"With one shovel strike, clang, clang, clang, the earth shook my hand, and had ice shards. The shovel broke clean off. I thought, 'Well now!?!?'\"\n\n\"That's interesting.\"\n\nRen Tong clapped his hands. \"And then, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, cold air sprayed out. Luckily, I went in person; if I had sent a subordinate, they would have been frozen solid on the spot.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Ren Tong even took off his shoes and socks, revealing a bluish-black big toe, severely frostbitten.\n\nFor someone of his cultivation and realm to be affected like this...\n\nIf an ordinary investigator went, they'd surely be done for.\n\nHowever, this also indirectly showed that he was a hands-on director.\n\n\"You see? How terrifying must this Corpse King below be? I'm still wondering now, what the heck is this Thousand Corpses Arching the King formation actually 'arching'?\"\n\n\"How did it even arch out something with an attribute?\"\n\nThis made Lu Ding's eyes light up. \"Hey, a rare find!!\"\n\nA Corpse King with an attribute.\n\nAnd it's ice.\n\nThat's not common.\n\nTypes of corpses, recorded in various miscellaneous texts, include dozens or even hundreds of types. Common ones include: Jiangshi*, Blood Corpse, Yin Corpse, Flesh Corpse, Waking Corpse...\n\nUncommon ones are: Armored Corpse, Stone Corpse, Combat Corpse, Vegetable Corpse, Cotton Corpse, and so on...\n\nAmong these, those with attributes are few. Hàn Bà* is one type, scorching the earth for a thousand li.\n\nBesides that, there's the Combat Corpse. As the name suggests, they are aggressive and belligerent. They were exceptionally gifted when alive, and even in death, they don't rest in peace.\n\nLu Ding pondered, \"The one below should be a Combat Corpse.\"\n\n\"But Combat Corpses also have sub-categories, such as Law Corpse, Spirit Corpse, Absolute Corpse... so we still need to go and see.\"\n\nThinking about the word 'corpse' so much, Lu Ding was almost starting to not recognize the character anymore. But regardless of which one it was, it was enough to indicate that the thing below was not to be trifled with.\n\nRen Tong nodded and said, \"Then I'll lead the way.\"\n\nSuddenly, he stopped.\n\nLu Ding asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\nRen Tong pondered, his expression thoughtful, \"The Law Corpse among Combat Corpses... does that mean it's called a 'Law Combat'?\"¹\n\n\"Hahahahaha...\"\n\nLu Ding was truly dumbfounded. What initially sounded like a fierce entity, after Ren Tong's explanation like that...\n\nHe inexplicably thought of \"Thousand Corpses Arching the King,\" arching a dog inside.\n\nAnd a French Bulldog at that.\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\"\n\nBai Hemian couldn't quite understand, after all, there were no French Bulldogs in this world.\n\nLu Ding shook his head. \"Nothing. I just thought of something amusing.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he slowly ascended into the air.\n\nMysterious patterns appeared on his face, spreading across his entire body.\n\nAs his aura expanded, Lu Ding spoke the harshest words in the calmest tone.\n\n\"Director Ren, point me in the direction of the Corpse King.\"\n\nWhy bother with so much unnecessary fuss?\n\nOnce the direction was set, he would just blast it directly. If he could beat it, he'd crush it to death. If he couldn't, Lu Ding would grab his people and run.\n\nHe could fly, after all.\n\nIn broad daylight, he didn't believe the thing below would dare to come out and fight him head-on under the sun.\n\nAt most, he'd just anger it. Lu Ding would fly in the sky, and it would burrow underground to chase.\n\nIf that happened, fine, no problem at all. Lu Ding would just fly with his people towards the nearest 749 Provincial Branch Bureau. Go ahead and chase him then.\n\nIf it didn't chase, a full day's time would be enough for Lu Ding to make several round trips. Each trip there and back wouldn't even take two hours. By then, the strong cultivators would come and clear the place out.\n\nThere would be no need to dig diversion channels in this place.\n\nOnce the strong cultivators from the General Branch Bureau arrived, and with no ordinary people around, under full firepower, they could probably blast a river channel into existence.\n\nRen Tong listened to Lu Ding's words. He probably understood what Lu Ding intended to do.\n\nPreviously, they had followed the rules because they thought it was just an ordinary grave, posed no threat, and could simply be relocated.\n\nNow that there was a Corpse King, the significance was different.\n\nRen Tong raised his hand and pointed towards the Corpse King's Tomb within the graveyard.\n\nHe hadn't even pinpointed the exact location yet.\n\nBoom!!!!\n\nA horrifying streak tore through a thousand meters, shattering all wild graves, isolated tombs, demons, and monsters in its path to smithereens.\n\nA large wave of colorless small crystals flowed into his account.\n\nRen Tong swallowed. \"Actually, it needed to be a little more to the side...\"\n\nBoom!!!!\n\nAnother punch, carrying terrifying power, blasted forth.\n\n\"Is that right now?\"\n\nListening to Lu Ding's inquiry, Ren Tong nodded mechanically.\n\nThe next second, Lu Ding shot out through the air.\n\nThen came: Boom!! Boom!! Boom!!\n\nIt left Ren Tong utterly dumbfounded. He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.\n\nWhile instinctively following, he struck up a conversation with Bai Hemian, who usually preferred not to speak.\n\n\"Does he usually do things this way?\"\n\nBai Hemian calmly retorted, \"Is something wrong with it?\"\n\n\"Tsk... it's not that it's wrong, it's just... it's just...\"\n\n---\n¹ **Li (里):** A traditional Chinese unit of distance, equivalent to 500 meters or about 0.31 miles.\n² **Jiangshi (殭屍):** Often translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"Chinese zombie,\" a reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore.\n³ **Hàn Bà (旱魃):** A mythical drought demon or goddess in Chinese mythology, said to cause severe droughts wherever it goes.\n⁴ **Law Combat (法斗):** A literal translation of \"法斗.\" \"法斗\" (fǎdòu) is a homophone for \"French Bulldog\" (法國鬥牛犬, fǎguó dòuniúquǎn, often shortened to 法斗).

    "content": "「Aren’t we supposed to go in, find the location, then figure out the situation, and finally make a move?」\n\nThat was how they used to handle things—procedures, processes, fixed ways of thinking.\n\nBai Hemian didn’t understand: 「Why walk if you can fly?」\n\nRentong: That somehow makes sense.\n\n「Didn’t you just point over there? Isn’t that the location?」\n\nRentong: That somehow also makes sense.\n\n「Between two points, isn’t a straight line the shortest? Lu Ding blasts over, we walk over, it’s both safe and fast.」\n\nRentong: That... still damn well makes sense.\n\n「Once we get there, we make a move. If we can beat them, we fight; if not, we run. There are no ordinary people anyway.」\n\nRentong fell silent.\n\nIt was indeed like that, but it was just too concise and clear.\n\nHe was a little unaccustomed to it.\n\nIt gave him a feeling, as if an electronic screen was before his eyes, full of coordinates. You point and click, a missile launches, directly flattening everything, convenient and fast.\n\nEverything happened so fast, it was like nothing had occurred.\n\nUnreal.\n\nBefore, they’d talk about tactical maneuvering. Now, what tactical maneuvering? Just blast away, and it’s done.\n\nThe single phrase 「no ordinary people」 completely liberated Lu Ding.\n\n「I’m not waiting for you, you’re too slow. If you don’t speed up, we’ll see him return on our way there.」\n\nBai Hemian finished speaking, then immediately accelerated, rushing towards the increasingly distant sound of轰擊.\n\nRentong froze. Was he being scoffed at?\n\nLu Ding can fly, I can’t outrun him, but can I not outrun you?\n\nYou can’t possibly fly.\n\nJust as the thought arose,\n\nBai Hemian transformed into a faint light, phasing along the ground and vanishing.\n\nDirector Ren: .......\n\nWell, never mind then.\n\nHe’d better just run along the path Lu Ding had blasted open.\n\nAt the very front.\n\nLu Ding blasted his way through, with tremendous momentum.\n\nA lone grave blocked the path, exuding chilling air, freezing plants and trees, and turning the earth into solid blocks.\n\nThere was nothing to explore or research, no need to confirm if this was the so-called Corpse King’s Tomb.\n\nHe raised his hand, pulled back his fist, his spinal qi apertures opened, and a brilliant halo shone brightly.\n\nLu Ding, a hundred meters in the sky, gathered power in his fists.\n\nThen he smashed them down.\n\nBOOM!!!!\n\nUnder the terrifying force and spiritual qi, the earth rolled, and the frozen soil shattered inch by inch.\n\nThe burial mound turned over, and rocks cracked open.\n\nThat grim face, covered in frost, emerged from beneath the ground, gazing at Lu Ding through the fissures in the earth.\n\nA grotesque smile stretched across its lips.\n\nThough no sound emerged from its writhing lips, sharp ice spikes threaded through the cracks, spreading onto the ground, before pillars of ice shot skyward.\n\nLu Ding twisted his body to dodge, leaping into the sky.\n\nFrom beneath the cracks, he heard a chilling wind accompanied by a sharp, high-pitched human voice.\n\n「What year is it now~」\n\n「You’re singing now?」\n\nAt this point, Lu Ding could almost certainly conclude that this thing was a Sorcerous Corpse.\n\nExtremely vicious, and capable of casting spells.\n\nHe smashed down from the air again, like a cannonball, straight to the ground.\n\nBOOM!!!\n\nWith Lu Ding’s smash, the ground within a radius of several hundred meters, in solid slabs, was directly pried up by him.\n\nThe true form of the Sorcerous Corpse appeared.\n\nClad in tattered armor, with its lower body exposed, it raised a hand and condensed ice into a canopy, blocking the sunlight.\n\n「You have the audac—you k—」\n\nThe word 「sin」 hadn’t even left its mouth.\n\nThe pried-up slab of earth shattered instantly.\n\nThat fist, now covered in black and red markings, not only smashed through the slab but also slammed into its face.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nCracks appeared on the Sorcerous Corpse’s face.\n\nAs its body was thrown out of control by the immense impact, it swept out a leg. That shriveled leg, adorned with sharp purple claws, aimed directly for Lu Ding’s temple.\n\nLu Ding raised his arm to block.\n\nThe Sorcerous Corpse was sent flying by the tremendous force.\n\nLu Ding tilted his head, looking at the spot where his arm had blocked. It was sizzling, and his clothes were completely corroded.\n\nBut his flesh was unharmed.\n\nThe Sorcerous Corpse tumbled away, stumbling. Its ice canopy shattered, and under the direct sunlight, its flesh and blood melted and collapsed inch by inch.\n\nIt rose without changing its expression.\n\nTwisting its neck, which had been contorted by the blow, its expression shifting, its scarlet tongue licked its parched lips.\n\n「You really don’t like to talk, do you?」\n\nAs it spoke, its tongue gathered white particles, bursting into a beam of light that shot directly towards Lu Ding.\n\nLu Ding stood still, tilting his head slightly.\n\nThe beam of light struck a thousand meters away. A huge explosion erupted, and rising smoke shot a hundred meters into the sky.\n\nSeeing that he could actually react in time,\n\nA flicker of surprise crossed the Sorcerous Corpse’s eyes.\n\nBut the next moment, it turned its head to look at Lu Ding, reading an inexplicable excitement in his eyes, and asked, puzzled, 「You seem very excited?」\n\n「Of course I’m excited! Your ability, I absolutely love it!!!」\n\nThis long-range attack method had no wind-up whatsoever, and its power was immense.\n\nIf Lu Ding hadn’t often done such things himself, and thus had a defense in mind,\n\nOtherwise, that last strike, he really wouldn’t have been able to dodge it easily.\n\n「Love my ability.......」\n\nFor some reason, the Sorcerous Corpse felt a chill down its spine. In the past, it was always the one making others’ hair stand on end.\n\nBut today...\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\n「Goodbye!!!」\n\nWith that, the Sorcerous Corpse tried to burrow straight into the ground. It couldn’t stay here one bit; it had to run!!!\n\nThis person sounds suspiciously shifty.\n\nMore like a monster than it was.\n\nJust as it burrowed into the ground, the earth began to rumble loudly.\n\nAs the scene flickered and shifted, a bronze hall rose from the ground, with thick copper pillars standing amidst crimson charcoal fires.\n\nThe Sorcerous Corpse, which had originally burrowed away, was now bound to it.\n\nStruggling continuously.\n\n「What kind of spell is this!?」\n\nLu Ding floated over, his gaze filled with scrutiny and appraisal.\n\nIs this the Bronze Pillar Torture for Killing¹?\n\nAs long as it encompassed the area and target, even if it burrowed down, it could still be bound and brought up.\n\nThe Sorcerous Corpse’s kick had given Lu Ding a preliminary sense of its power.\n\nIt was decent.\n\nYet, a monster that he evaluated as such could now be effortlessly bound to a copper pillar.\n\nFeeling the unrestrained gaze fixed upon it,\n\nThe Sorcerous Corpse struggled harder and harder.\n\nPanic spread in its heart.\n\nIt inexplicably read a feeling in the eyes of the person before it, a feeling rarely seen in humans.\n\nIt was like appraising its prey, the kind of gaze a predator reveals when it’s not quite hungry yet, when toying with and torturing its quarry.\n\nIt was also the very gaze it had most loved to show in the past.\n\nWhen tormenting those Qi Refiners, it had been exactly like this.\n\nBut today, the roles were reversed.\n\nIt had actually become the prey.\n\n「Let’s talk, let’s discuss this. After all, I used to be human. Let me go, and I’ll repay you.」\n\nThe smile on Lu Ding’s face grew wider and wider.\n\n「Repay me? Revealing that move you just used—that would be your best repayment!!」\n\nHe raised his hand and formed a spell, wind fanning the flames, and the copper pillars turned red inch by inch.\n\nAn unpleasant sizzling sound began.\n\nLike tender, juicy slices of meat falling onto a glowing red grill during a barbecue.\n\n「Ah!!!!」\n\n---\n¹ **Bronze Pillar Torture (炮烙, Pao Luo):** An ancient Chinese torture method said to have been used by King Zhou of Shang. It involved a bronze pillar or cylinder, greased and heated with charcoal, over which the condemned were forced to walk or embrace until they fell into the burning coals below.

Corpse demons feel pain too?\"\n\nLogically, corpse-type monsters shouldn't feel pain, but now it was screaming so miserably.\n\nLu Ding was somewhat surprised.\n\nUnder the assault of pain, the corpse demon's body burst into raging flames, constantly carbonizing.\n\nNo matter how much it released its chilling aura, it couldn't stop it in the slightest.\n\nIts upper and lower jaws opened to an exaggerated degree, muscle fibers clearly visible, trembling continuously with the screams.\n\nIt had a lot to say, to respond to Lu Ding, but it was too painful, too painful!!!!\n\nIt was so painful it couldn't utter a single word, only continuously scream and wail.\n\nBut Lu Ding, listening to this sound, while his expression didn't fluctuate much, compared to before, it now carried a hint of wanton arrogance.\n\nWhat would drop?\n\nSomething ice-related, or that instant-cast attack from just now?\n\nLu Ding felt a faint anticipation in his heart.\n\nNot far away.\n\nTwo people witnessed the entire process firsthand.\n\nWatching the corpse demon carbonize inch by inch, and the expression on Lu Ding's face.\n\nRen Tong was deep in thought, while Bai Hemian said, \"See? I told you we were too late.\"\n\nIndeed, they were too late.\n\nBut Ren Tong wanted to say, it wasn't that late, was it? Not more than five minutes.\n\nThe Corpse King was just crippled like that?\n\nAnd what was with Lu Ding's faintly expectant expression, coupled with his unwavering gaze as he watched the Corpse King carbonize and die!?\n\nNo!!\n\nThis...\n\nThis is a bit off, isn't it?\n\nAlthough it was a monster and deserved to be killed, that expression... it had too many implications.\n\nAs if watching a monster die miserably was something worth getting excited about.\n\nThis mental state...\n\nHmm... Ren Tong didn't know what to say.\n\nAll he could say was, Yunmeng's talents, may you all fend for yourselves; thankfully, you are 'human'.\n\nHere, the corpse demon's screams vanished.\n\nOnly charcoal remained, hanging on the bronze pillar.\n\n[Containment Target: Corpse Demon]\n[Containment Reward: Qi Devouring Death Ray]\n[Qi Devouring Death Ray: Condenses the characteristics of one's own Qi to destroy incoming life force.]\n\nA smile finally appeared on Lu Ding's face; although nothing ice-related dropped, the corpse demon's move from earlier did.\n\nHe wasn't a greedy person; he'd get everything he deserved in the future.\n\nThere were so many monsters in the world; he wouldn't kill them all into extinction.\n\nMoreover, ice-type techniques, while usable for Lu Ding, weren't as good as this one.\n\nIt wasn't as if he'd get something like absolute zero.\n\nBut on second thought, something like absolute zero couldn't be dropped by a corpse demon he instantly killed, could it?\n\nWith more and more powerful techniques at his disposal, Lu Ding already fantasized about letting his enemies choose their own way of dying in the future.\n\nJust like flipping cards.\n\nDisplaying a scene similar to a final execution in a game.\n\nUnder the oppressive black clouds, a malevolent dragon coiled, a storm of blood and gore danced, swirling petals filled the sky, black and red patterns clinging to his body.\n\nWith his scholarly and martial sleeves fluttering, Lu Ding spread his hands.\n\n\"Come, choose your way to die.\"\n\nThat feeling of letting enemies choose their own way of dying, experiencing the terror of the unknown, and the process of death arriving.\n\nBoth showy and elegant.\n\nThis feeling was like playing 'Fight the Landlord'¹ and announcing a pair while holding both Kings at the end – words couldn't describe how satisfying it was.\n\nBut Lu Ding still had a long way to go before reaching such a moment of full visual impact.\n\nCurrently, he still knew too few powerful spells.\n\nNot enough.\n\nThe bronze hall dissipated.\n\nWith the death of the corpse demon, the 'Thousand Corpses Guarding the King' formation gradually dispersed.\n\nUnder the shaking ground, dragon Qi soared into the sky.\n\nLu Ding raised a hand and extended a finger; with spirit Qi mobilized, a dark red light orb gathered at his fingertip.\n\nAimed at the sky.\n\nQuietly erupted.\n\nIn an instant, it was as if all light had been drawn from this area, a dark red hue permeating the heavens and earth.\n\nIlluminating Lu Ding's face, revealing his wicked charm and wild arrogance.\n\nHis wanton smile, under the black-red light, was utterly rampant.\n\nJust then, the soaring dragon Qi was shattered in the sky.\n\nLu Ding's smile lasted less than a second, vanishing instantly.\n\n\"Bad!!!\"\n\nThe geomantic dragon Qi was scattered, what would he hand in for the mission!?\n\nHe hurriedly took out his purple gourd, channeling Qi into it to absorb the fragmented dragon Qi from the sky.\n\nAfter collecting it.\n\nLu Ding brought the gourd to his eye, squinting to look inside.\n\nOne was somewhat complete, one... could be considered complete after piecing it together.\n\nAlthough a bit tattered, it was still a geomantic dragon vein energy line, after all.\n\nIt'll work!!\n\nThe purple gourd transformed back into a ring and slipped onto Lu Ding's hand.\n\nHe turned his head to look at where Bai Hemian and Ren Tong were.\n\nHe saw Ren Tong at that moment, mouth slightly agape, tilting his head forty-five degrees to gaze at the sky where the dragon Qi had previously soared.\n\nThat last attack, although the dragon Qi was a somewhat weak reference point for the explosion.\n\nBut... your... Divine Palace!!???\n\n\"Director Ren, inform your people to prepare to work.\"\n\nLu Ding's voice interrupted the momentary 'freeze' caused by his cognitive disarray.\n\nRen Tong snapped back to reality: \"Oh, oh, oh, alright, alright, Lu Taisui, given your personality, you'll probably go straight to Yunmeng later, won't you?\"\n\nWell, he'd changed his address now.\n\nAccording to 749 Bureau's rank division, Lu Ding's rank was lower than Ren Tong's.\n\nBut he was a student from advanced training, dispatched here to handle affairs, a special envoy.\n\nSo, by this reckoning, they were of equal rank.\n\nHowever, Lu Ding's continuous display of techniques made Ren Tong wonder, equal rank?\n\nFrom 749 Bureau's perspective, we are indeed of equal rank, but from my, Ren Tong's, perspective, I can't be equal at all.\n\n\"More or less. There's nothing much else here.\"\n\nHearing this, Ren Tong's smile made his face wrinkle up in a heap.\n\n\"Um... Lu Taisui, since you're going to Yunmeng, could you perhaps do me a small personal favor? I'm willing to give you two hundred contribution points.\"\n\nTwo hundred contribution points, that's quite a lot.\n\nLu Ding was somewhat tempted: \"You can tell me about it first.\"\n\n\"It's like this, I have a daughter who's in her third year of high school at Yunmeng Fifth High. Perhaps because of my background, she doesn't get along with the children from those Qi cultivator families at school.\"\n\nYunmeng Fifth High, one of the top three key high schools in the Great Han, with an outrageously high university admission rate.\n\nWhen Lu Ding was still an ordinary person, he often heard legends about Yunmeng Fifth High.\n\n\"Don't get along?\"\n\n\"Being bullied?\"\n\nRen Tong's expression was hard to describe: \"It's not exactly being bullied, but she's been wronged. The ones leading it are a few juniors from the Ruan family and the Zhai family.\"\n\n\"They're careful with the degree of it. As the Director of the Minshan City 749 Bureau, it's inconvenient for me to step in. If I were to act as a Qi cultivator myself, that would be an adult bullying a minor, and Yunmeng is their stronghold.\"\n\n\"I did try to find local investigators before, but it only quieted down for a while, and then it started again.\"\n\n\"And I also don't dare to go too far. I know your style of doing things, which might be a bit more... unconventional than others...\"\n\nAt this, Ren Tong's expression was conflicted; he felt awkward.\n\n\"So, you see, could you please just help me out?\"\n---\n¹ **Fight the Landlord**: A popular Chinese card game. Announcing a pair while holding both Kings signifies a highly advantageous position, often leading to an easy win.",

    "content": "Ren Tong's tone quickened slightly: \"Then both the Ruan family and the Zhai family have juniors ranked at the top of the Talent List.\"\n\n\"If you use this as a point of conflict, it's justifiable, right? And you're not that old, you're their peer...\"\n\nThe bald giant, nearly two meters tall, had his face flushed crimson after saying these words.\n\nBut he couldn't help it.\n\nEvery family has a difficult scripture to recite.¹\n\nThe 749 Station Chief is actually quite a significant position, but it depends on who you're comparing him to.\n\nMoreover, you can't use this identity to do just anything; it would invite gossip and have an impact.\n\nFurthermore, Minshan City isn't within the Yunmeng scope; it's on the border.\n\nMany things, bit by bit, can become truly sickening.\n\nLu Ding could also understand Ren Tong's helplessness.\n\nThey covertly isolate and target your daughter, and you genuinely can't do anything about it.\n\nSecretly, you'd love to tear them apart, but when brought out into the open, it's not a particularly big deal.\n\nThey didn't actually harm your daughter.\n\nYou can't even escalate it to a serious matter.²\n\nSo, this is like a toad squatting on your instep – it doesn't bite, but it's disgusting.³\n\nListening to Ren Tong's words,\n\nLu Ding could understand that this was the helplessness of a father.\n\nSo, this matter could be handled, and two hundred contribution points could be accepted. He just didn't know which family to make an example of.\n\nNow that he'd stumbled upon it, he might as well start with the Zhai and Ruan families.\n\nMoreover, Ren Tong didn't play any tricks; he spoke from the heart. He was so embarrassed that the top of his head was almost red.\n\n\"Alright, I'll handle this for you, I guarantee it will be done perfectly. But there's a good chance it will only treat the symptoms, not the root cause. Why don't you have her transfer schools?\"\n\nRen Tong sighed: \"I've also thought about transferring schools, but other places are too far, and I'm not at ease.\"\n\n\"Her mother was also with 749; we met early. Later, she had an accident during a mission, and I haven't remarried all these years. If she were to transfer to a key school outside, the quality of education would be one issue.\"\n\n\"Distance is the biggest problem. She's a young lady, eighteen years old, I'm not at ease.\"\n\nIndeed, eighteen isn't particularly old, and she's still in her final year of high school.\n\nIt's right to be uneasy.\n\nHowever, speaking of studies, Lu Ding suddenly remembered that he would also be starting school soon.\n\nTheir school was among the last batch to start classes, but that was just a matter of a few days.\n\nHis counselor was good to Lu Ding. He should give them a call then.\n\n\"Then let's not talk about it anymore. I'll handle this for you. Send me the information and photos of those people. I'll go over there shortly.\"\n\nIt's easily done.\n\nLu Ding had already decided that today he would make a guest appearance as a hooligan waiting at the school gate.\n\nTo deal with such people, the simple and direct method is to beat them, give them a good thrashing. \"Do you submit? If not, call your family here.\"\n\n\"Then beat them all together.\"\n\nGenerally, when such situations arise, not all, but most are due to problematic family upbringing.\n\nOnce they're bundled up and sorted out, they'll all behave.\n\nHearing Lu Ding agree, Ren Tong immediately smiled. The redness on the top of his head receded.\n\nHis expression changed in an instant.\n\n\"Oh oh oh, okay okay okay, I'll send it to you right away.\"\n\nSeeing his change of expression, Lu Ding added:\n\n\"However, Chief Ren, let's make things clear beforehand to avoid trouble later.⁴ I'm helping out. I don't know what kind of person your daughter is, but you should know what kind of person I am. I don't spoil children, you know.\"\n\nDon't let her throw a tantrum like a pampered young lady in front of him later.\n\nThen Lu Ding would have to discipline her along with the others.\n\nRen Tong waved his hand: \"Don't worry, my daughter won't.\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding was at ease.\n\nHere, Chief Ren was about to transfer contribution points to Lu Ding. Although two hundred contribution points were indeed a lot, for his child, he felt it was well worth the expense, worth it! So worth it!\n\nSuddenly.\n\nRen Tong's expression changed.\n\nJust now, Lu Ding had created such a grand scene here, so he hadn't seen his phone.\n\nNow that he looked.\n\nRen Tong said: \"Lu Taisui, Yu Chen from the Yu family sent people over, saying they want to take Nie Qingfei away.\"\n\nYu Chen?\n\nLu Ding thought of the chat history on 'Little Six's' phone from earlier.\n\n\"Did they send people so quickly?\"\n\n\"Let's go take a look.\"\n\nThe three swept towards the direction of the Yi Zhuang.\n\n.....\n\nInside the Yi Zhuang.\n\nThe person Yu Chen sent was an old man who appeared to be in his early sixties.\n\nAs soon as he arrived at this place, he was shocked by the traces left by Lu Ding's punch.\n\nThese combat traces and lingering aura made him take it seriously.\n\nJust as he was observing the lingering patterns within, attempting to gauge the true strength of its owner,\n\nThe booming explosion from afar interrupted Old Shui's thoughts.\n\nThe dark red light pulled at the distant sky, changing its color for a while.\n\nThis move could be said to have truly made him bow his head as a Fated-Life realm practitioner.\n\nAlthough he didn't know who unleashed this move,\n\nThat wasn't important.\n\nWhat was important was that no matter who this person was, today, here, there was someone he couldn't afford to provoke.\n\nMoreover, this person must be from 749, because there were only 749 investigators here.\n\nThe young master had said when he came, \"tailor the approach to the person.\"⁵\n\nNow, he hadn't even met the person yet.\n\nOld Shui had already decided how to 'pair the dishes'.\n\nAnd just like that.\n\nWatching three figures sweep over, two of them unfamiliar,\n\nOld Shui, with a smile on his face, immediately said: \"Oh dear, Chief Ren, long time no see. You're still as radiant as ever, you've worked hard, truly hard. These two investigators have also worked hard. This old man's visit today is truly an imposition, my apologies, my apologies.\"\n\nAs the saying goes, one does not strike a smiling face.\n\nWith such an attitude, apologizing with every other sentence, clasping hands every three sentences,\n\nAnd he was a Fated-Life realm powerhouse.\n\nHe had given Ren Tong more than enough face.\n\nHowever, this kind of deference was all for show. Ren Tong understood in his heart that, like himself, Old Shui was probably startled by Lu Ding's display of power.\n\nIt was just a matter of tailoring his approach to the person.\n\nIf it were just him here today, it probably wouldn't be like this.\n\nRen Tong didn't speak, smiling and nodding. He stepped aside, leaving the stage to Lu Ding.\n\nThis also showed his attitude: \"You can't claim any close relationship with me, we have no personal ties. Someone else is in charge today.\"\n\nOld Shui's gaze fell upon Lu Ding.\n\nUnfamiliar, unknown, and still young. But he didn't underestimate Lu Ding because of it.\n\nInstead, he asked somewhat cautiously:\n\n\"My humble name is Shui Shi, may I ask who you are...?\"\n\nLu Ding responded with a smile: \"My name is Lu Ding. I have something to do shortly, so I won't waste time with pleasantries. Let's be direct and frank.⁶\"\n\n\"You can't take the person away. 749 has no such rule.\"\n\n\"Additionally, when you go back, remember to inform Yu Chen. Tell him to prepare to report to the local 749 and undertake two months of advanced study on Qi Refiner Management Regulations.\"\n\nOld Shui was a bit confused at first.\n\nWasn't the young master at home?\n\nHe hadn't done anything.\n\nHe subconsciously asked: \"Why?\"\n\nLu Ding unlocked Little Six's phone and threw it over. On it was the chat history: \"Take a look yourself.\"\n\n\"Knowing that 749 was handling things, and still having someone secretly photograph it. Knowingly breaking the law. Two months should be enough.\"\n\n---\n¹ `家家都有本難念的經` (jiā jiā dōu yǒu běn nán niàn de jīng): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"Every family has a difficult scripture to recite,\" implying that every family has its own unique troubles or problems that are hard to deal with.\n² `上綱上線` (shàng gāng shàng xiàn): A Chinese idiom meaning to \"raise something to the level of principle\" or \"over-analyze a minor issue.\" Here, it implies escalating a situation to a more serious level.\n³ `癩蛤蟆趴腳面，不咬人噁心人的事兒` (làihámá pā jiǎomiàn, bù yǎorén ěxīn rén de shìr): A Chinese colloquialism literally meaning \"A toad squatting on one's instep – it doesn't bite, but it's disgusting.\" It describes a situation or person that is annoying and bothersome, making one feel disgusted, even if it causes no actual harm.\n⁴ `先說斷後不亂` (xiān shuō duàn hòu bù luàn): A Chinese idiom meaning to \"make things clear beforehand to avoid confusion or trouble later.\"\n⁵ `見人下菜碟` (jiàn rén xià càidié): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"to tailor the dish to the guest,\" implying to adapt one's approach or behavior according to the person one is dealing with, often suggesting flattery or opportunism.\n⁶ `打開天窗說亮話` (dǎkāi tiānchuāng shuō liànghuà): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"to open the skylight and speak bright words,\" signifying to speak frankly and directly, without beating around the bush.",

    "content": "Old Man Shui’s expression was a little unsightly.\n\nTreating people differently based on their status was not wrong.\n\nBut Yu Chen was someone he watched grow up, was his master, and even more so, his junior.\n\nIf Yu Chen was to be taken to 749 for two months of training just because of this, it would definitely be very embarrassing.\n\nOld Man Shui knew that Yu Chen was concealing his brilliance and biding his time, merely hiding his true abilities.\n\nBut, a minister dies if his lord is humiliated.\n\nThe rules of 749, the Qi Refiner Management Regulations, were indeed like this, that was right.\n\nBut this matter could be big or small; it absolutely wasn't worth two months of training.\n\nThe person before him was Lu Ding. Old Man Shui had also heard of his moniker, Corpse-Disarming Grand General.\n\nIt was precisely because of this that he did not get angry.\n\nInstead, he forcibly suppressed his anger, and said with as gentle a tone as possible: \"Can we discuss this, Grand General Lu?\"\n\n\"Discuss?\"\n\nLu Ding put away his smile: \"Did I give you too much leeway? The Qi Refiner Management Regulations, are these negotiable!?! Qi Refiners performing a mission, is this something that can be secretly filmed!?! What is his status? Local 749 is handling matters, does he have to know? Now he even wants to come and demand someone, what, is 749 serving him?\"\n\nOld Man Shui’s expression was grim.\n\nEmotional intelligence was emotional intelligence, but a bottom line was a bottom line.\n\nOn the bottom line, he, and, Lu Ding, had a conflict.\n\nThis wasn't a matter of treating people differently based on their status.\n\nBut a matter of principle.\n\n\"If you insist on making things this ugly, Grand General Lu, you wouldn't want your trip to Yunmeng to be unsuccessful, would you?\"\n\nLu Ding smiled.\n\nPointing at his body camera.\n\n\"Old man, threatening a 749 investigator, challenging Qi Refiner law, don't move, if you move, it's resisting arrest.\"\n\nAs he spoke, black-red particles gathered in Lu Ding's left eye, forming a black-red orb of light, emitting a strange and terrifying aura.\n\nThat's right, Lu Ding was doing it on purpose.\n\nHe deliberately let the old man feel the terror within it. If he moved after this strike, it would be resisting arrest. As for the consequences of resisting arrest, Lu Ding could attack however he pleased. If he didn't move, he would get injured, and the final result would still be to be taken to 749's prison.\n\nSo, simply put, Lu Ding was forcing him to comply.\n\nOtherwise, he would have started with \"Zero Frame\" long ago.\n\nSure enough, feeling the terror of its power.\n\nOld Man Shui’s expression was grave.\n\nDon't move? How the hell can I not move?\n\nLu Ding struck with a bang, Old Man Shui dodged, and the dark-red light orb directly shattered the ground a thousand meters behind him.\n\nBoom!!!\n\nShockwaves rolled in, stirring up dust.\n\nOld Man Shui’s heart sank, and he turned to flee.\n\nThis fight would be difficult today. Lu Ding, this person, was too crazy to directly attack; the situation was unfavorable for him. As long as he ran back to Yunmeng, everything would be easy to talk about, everything would be easy to handle. But if he stayed here, his end, was hard to say.\n\nBut just as he turned around.\n\nHe saw the owner of those black-red eyes, his face covered in strange dark-red patterns. Twisting his body forward, pulling his fist back. A bizarre evil dragon's phantom, faintly discernible, coiled, a pair of chaotic pupils cast upon them, making people's hearts uneasy.\n\n\"I told you not to move!!!\"\n\nA punch slammed out.\n\nDust burst open, a sonic boom spread out, blowing away the dust.\n\nOld Man Shui subconsciously coated his hands with blue spiritual qi, blocking in front of his chest.\n\nBang!!!!\n\nThe punch landed firmly.\n\nTerrifying power, tens of thousands of jin, slammed onto his arms.\n\nThe sound of bones breaking and cracking was heard.\n\nOld Man Shui only felt as if he had been hit by a rapidly approaching train. His entire body flew backward.\n\nBang bang bang.......\n\nThe sound of impacts rang out continuously, looking from this spot to the distance, extending for several hundred meters. With each impact, continuous plumes of dust rose, one plume with each impact, rising more than ten times consecutively. That was the dust stirred up by Old Man Shui being sent flying by the terrifying force of Lu Ding's punch, impacting the ground and the ruins of the ancestral hall.\n\n\"Cough.....\"\n\nAccompanied by a cough.\n\nOld Man Shui steadied himself. In front of him were dozens of meters of \"brake marks\" dug into the ground, where he had slid to dissipate the force after being sent flying backward and regaining his footing. Soil was churned up, half a meter deep. Looking at his hands again, they were twisted out of shape. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.\n\nHis heart was terrified: What terrifying physical strength!!\n\nSuddenly, a sense of danger surged in his heart.\n\nIn an instant, a dark-red light pillar struck.\n\nOld Man Shui quickly dodged. The light pillar landed beside him, directly exploding, sending him tumbling, his chest charred black, most of his face disfigured.\n\nNo time to hesitate.\n\nUnder the mobilization of spiritual qi, his twisted hands superficially recovered, but the injuries remained.\n\nOld Man Shui formed a hand seal with his little finger, three sections, pressing it to the ground. In an instant, the sound of water waves echoed, the ground turned into a swamp, and various water monsters surged out of the water. They varied in size, had ferocious appearances, and numbered in the hundreds. Amidst the rippling water, they charged towards Lu Ding.\n\nWhile he himself, dragging his damaged body, turned and ran.\n\nCan't beat him, no way to fight at all!!!\n\nLu Ding flew forward, directly colliding with the various water monsters charging at him, chaotic slashes erupting all around his body, cutting and pulverizing these monsters in front of him.\n\nWind sounds struck from behind.\n\nOld Man Shui formed another hand seal, and the world fell silent. Water droplets fell. As long as they struck the water surface, causing ripples, Old Man Shui could unleash one of his ultimate killing techniques: the Wave Scroll Three Thousand Slicing Technique.\n\nBut before the water droplets even hit the surface, a whip kick broke through the air.\n\nOne kick.\n\nCrack!!!\n\nThe water droplets were shattered in mid-air as they fell.\n\nOld Man Shui's face showed shock as he turned his head to look: \"How did you enter the spellcasting domain!?!?\"\n\nLu Ding replied with silence.\n\nSpellcasting domain? Between heaven and earth, Lu Ding was one with nature; any domain was beneath heaven and earth. As long as the spellcaster wasn't stronger than him, their spellcasting domain was a joke in front of Lu Ding.\n\n\"Shui Shi.\"\n\nLu Ding called out a name. Earlier, this old man had reported his name, and now it came in handy. As the name was called out by Lu Ding, \"Calling Name for Soul Loss\" silently activated. The old man's three souls and seven spirits trembled, and his consciousness became muddled.\n\nLu Ding closed in.\n\nHe slammed a palm down, pressing Shui Shi and dragging him across the ground for dozens of meters, leaving a deep blood-stained furrow. The dark-red orb of light reformed in Lu Ding's eye.\n\n\"You dare to kill me!?\"\n\nBang!!!\n\nShui Shi was directly blown apart in Lu Ding's hands.\n\nAlways, his replies were given after the fight, standing on the corpses of others. This time, it was no exception.\n\n\"Threatening a 749 investigator, plus resisting arrest, if I don't kill you, should I praise you?\"\n\nIf this person hadn't threatened him, Lu Ding wouldn't have been so decisive. This person implicitly and explicitly said that as long as he dared to send Yu Chen for training, then he should be careful on his trip to Yunmeng. With these words spoken, and spoken by a Sima Realm cultivator. If Lu Ding didn't kill him, should he keep him around to cause trouble later?\n\nRen Tong watched Lu Ding suppress and beat the Sima Realm cultivator throughout; his heart was already numb. He actually developed a delusion. Perhaps this was the right way.\n\nHe patted the dirt and blood off his hands. Lu Ding turned around and said: \"Director Ren, please handle the battlefield.\"\n\n\"Are you leaving?\" Ren Tong came back to his senses.\n\n\"Yes, to avoid further complications.\"\n\nThese words indeed matched Lu Ding's temperament.\n\nRen Tong mumbled to himself, then continued: \"Then you must pay attention to your safety. As far as I know, Yu Chen is not well-regarded in the Yu family. Shui Shi was the only Sima Realm cultivator by his side. Now that Shui Shi is dead, the Yu family probably won't react much, but whether Yu Chen will cause a scene is unknown......\"\n\n\"He can cause a scene however he wants. If any random person can threaten a 749 investigator, then I don't need to do this job anymore.\"\n\nLu Ding would not tolerate this indignity.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Treating people differently based on their status**: A literal translation of \"見人下菜碟\" (jiànrén xiàcàidié), an idiom meaning to treat people differently based on their status or power, like setting out different dishes for guests of varying importance.\n2.  **Concealing his brilliance and biding his time, merely hiding his true abilities**: A combination of two idioms: \"韜光養晦\" (tāoguāngyǎnghuì) means \"to conceal one's abilities and bide one's time,\" and \"藏拙\" (cángzhuō) means \"to hide one's clumsiness or lack of skill,\" but often implies hiding one's true, greater abilities.\n3.  **A minister dies if his lord is humiliated**: A literal translation of \"主辱臣死\" (zhǔrǔchénsǐ), an ancient adage emphasizing extreme loyalty, where a loyal minister would rather die than see his lord humiliated.\n4.  **Corpse-Disarming Grand General**: A translation of \"解屍太歲\" (jiěshītài suì). \"太歲\" (Tàisuì) refers to the Grand Duke Jupiter, a powerful and often feared deity in Chinese folk religion, associated with yearly misfortunes.

    "content": "「No, no, no, it's not that bad, not that bad.」\n\nRen Tong quickly said.\n\nIf Lu Ding came here this time and then quit when he went back, then his sin would be immense.\n\nAlthough these words were just talk, even talk was not allowed. He had to patch things up promptly. He quickly changed the subject: 「Lord Lu, how about I help you send some news over there? Just say you're going to Yunmeng today?」\n\n「No need for great fanfare, it's too high-profile. Xiao Bai and I will just go like this.

No matter how arrogant he got, he wouldn't dare to tangle with a Dì Chá Realm cultivator.\n\nWhat is Dì Chá?\n\nPart of the origin of this realm's name comes from: Heaven has Heavenly Gods, and Earth has Earth Deities. Respectively corresponding to the later Dì Chá Realm and Tiān Chá Realm, patrolling heaven and earth. They were bordering on godhood; these were not beings 'humans' could contend with. Lu Ding couldn't handle them now, so he might as well run early.\n\nRen Tong smiled as he listened.\n\nHe had witnessed firsthand how formidable Lu Ding was, and now these words were spoken with such prudence. There was no sense of distance at all.\n\nIf you can't beat them, run.\n\nIt made sense, too much sense, almost unlike something he would say.\n\nWith things handled here, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian departed directly. On the way, he reviewed the messages and data Ren Tong had sent. He also looked up Yu Chen's information.\n\nLu Ding's summary was as follows.\n\nFirst, there were the Zhai family and the Ruan family. Anyway, both were families of Qi Refiners, so there wasn't much to introduce. The focus was on the younger talents from both families who were on the rankings.\n\nAmong them, from the Zhai family, one person was ranked fifth: Zhai Lin, nicknamed 'River-Crossing Dragon'. Seven Heavens of the Divine Palace, wielded a three-sectional staff, cultivated the Zhai family's secret true unraveling, 'Green Waves Congeal Cold', capable of condensing a Spirit Sea into a cold pool. The family's deep foundation was simply different from that of ordinary Qi Refiners.\n\nFrom the Ruan family, one person was ranked fourth. Named Ruan Xiaoqi, Seven Heavens of the Divine Palace, given the nickname 'River-Blocking Dragon', and had a very good relationship with Zhai Lin. Used a black short knife, cultivated the Ruan family's secret true unraveling, 'Stacking Waves Push Mountains', where the strength of Qi energy surpassed itself with each layer.\n\nSeeing this name, Lu Ding thought for a moment.\n\n「Luckily you don't have older brothers named Ruan Xiao Er or Ruan Xiao Wu.」\n\nOtherwise, Lu Ding would have thought he'd arrived at Liangshan Marsh.\n\nLooking over the information on the two, aside from Ruan Xiaoqi's name being decent, Lu Ding saw no bright spots whatsoever.\n\nThat's about it. Not much strength.\n\nFinally, there was Yu Chen from the Yu family.\n\nLooking at his information, wow, Lu Ding felt a strong scent of an old-school novel protagonist waft over him.\n\nAs the youngest of the four direct descendants in the younger generation, above Yu Chen, there were two older sisters and one older brother.\n\nThe young Yu Chen could be called the Yu family's most prominent prodigy. He started cultivating at eight years old, opened his acumen in one day, and entered the Zhào Xuán Realm in one year, even while suppressing his cultivation speed. You know, Yu Chen was only nine at that time, his body hadn't even fully developed, and he already entered the Zhào Xuán Realm? As for his older brother, Yu Huai, who was only a year older than Yu Chen, he was still playing around in the Open Acumen Realm. Although he was also a genius, with Yu Chen being such a gem, he naturally wasn't as conspicuous.\n\nLater, when Yu Chen was eleven, he and Yu Huai went out to play, while fishing in the river. Suddenly the sky darkened. Rain poured down. For some reason, the two actually got lost, and finally, Yu Huai went home alone to tell the adults that his younger brother was missing. The Yu family searched for a good long while, finally finding Yu Chen caught on some grass at a point downstream. Publicly, it was announced that Yu Chen had drowned.\n\nSeeing this, Lu Ding was somewhat at a loss for words.\n\nEleven years old, even if his body hadn't fully developed due to age. You might not enter the Spirit Sea Realm, but your Zhào Xuán cultivation was certainly there. And he was a child who grew up by the water, would he be washed away?\n\nTreating people like fools.\n\nLater, after resuscitation, Yu Chen did survive, but it was said his foundation was damaged. From then on, he remained stuck in the Zhào Xuán Realm. It was even difficult for him to enter the Spirit Sea Realm.\n\nIn contrast, his brother Yu Huai, from then on, diligently cultivated, advancing rapidly all the way, and last year even soared to the second position on the Talent Rankings. He achieved a resounding reputation, earning the nickname 'Jade-Faced White Dragon'. But the relationship between the two brothers developed a rift after that incident.\n\nAs for the two older sisters, they felt even more heartache for Yu Chen. They often helped him resolve troubles. For instance, Yu Chen had provoked someone from the Lan family, someone from the Ruan family, competed for affection with someone today, or arranged an online fight with someone tomorrow. All these were resolved by his two older sisters.\n\nSeeing this, Lu Ding couldn't help but feel suspicious; someone so outstanding in his early years. Even if he had gone through these things, no matter how much he abandoned himself, he wouldn't turn out like this now.\n\nOn the ground, Bai Hemian was moving stealthily, looking up at Lu Ding in the sky, who was frowning. He called out: 「What are you thinking about?」\n\n「I just feel that something about this Yu Chen isn't right.」\n\nSeeing that they were about to fly into Yunmeng, the city appeared before their eyes. The sky was clear at the moment, with few clouds. Continuing to fly might risk being seen. Lu Ding found a place to land, choosing to walk to the city to hail a taxi. Bai Hemian followed, landing with a jog that turned into a slow walk.\n\n「What's wrong?」\n\n「The disparity in his persona before and after is too great. Looking at Yu Chen's information, he was one way before eleven years old, and another way after, and there were even changes in between.」\n\nHearing this, Bai Hemian quietly pulled out his phone and searched for Yu Chen in the 749 database.\n\nLu Ding smiled helplessly. He really didn't bother to look at it at all. He continued.\n\n「To dissect the problem, there are a few key points: a Qi Refiner family, a genius, and eleven years old.」\n\n「You know, it's modern times now. Forget about genius youths in Qi Refiner families, even ordinary children nowadays, by age eleven, they already understand a lot.」\n\n「After all, it's the internet age now; information explosion means many things can be accessed without leaving home.」\n\n「For children, there are pros and cons. The good is that they can broaden their horizons more widely; the bad is that they indiscriminately accept all comers.」\n\n「And Yu Chen is a genius. In this regard, the Yu family would definitely exercise some control, otherwise, he'd be exposed to too many bad things.」\n\n「So, at eleven, his mindset might not be particularly mature, but he definitely wouldn't become such a person after experiencing that kind of blow.」\n\n「Because the education he received from a young age, and his worldview before eleven, wouldn't allow him to be like this. The information states that the Yu family once spent a lot of manpower and resources to find a way to restore him.」\n\n「But there was no way.」\n\n「This point is very suspicious.」\n\nAt this point, Yan Feifan's voice suddenly came from Bai Hemian's phone.\n\n【Brother Lu, I understand what you mean. Are you trying to say that on the surface, Yu Chen's incident was just being swept away by water, not dying.】\n\n【For a Qi Refiner family, this is completely a minor issue. If they want to cure it, it's a matter of minutes.】\n\nLu Ding was somewhat surprised by Yan Feifan's voice. It turned out that just now, Bai Hemian felt he couldn't quite understand, but he didn't interrupt Lu Ding's speech either. Instead, he quietly dialed Yan Feifan's number. He couldn't quite understand, but Yan Feifan could. Yan Feifan was in charge of thought interaction with Lu Ding; he just needed to listen.",

    "content": "Lu Ding also didn't ask why Yan Feifan was currently on the phone with Bai Hemian.\n\nHe continued, picking up on Yan Feifan's words.\n\n\"Yes, from the above, the Yu Family cared for him when he first had problems.\"\n\n\"So, at first, the Yu Family didn't give up on him.\"\n\n\"As for why the Yu Family became indifferent to him later, the turning point was the third month after Yu Chen's incident.\"\n\n\"In the second month, the Yu Family had basically tried most of the methods they could find.\"\n\n\"So, without our knowledge, the Yu Family must have lost hope of restoring Yu Chen's original talent in the second month.\"\n\n\"But even then, the Yu Family hadn't given up on him.\"\n\n\"It wasn't until the third month, when Yu Chen went out and had an encounter with Qu Ningyan of the Yunmeng Qu Family, who is also currently the number one on the Yunmeng Talent List. From that point, the Yu Family's attitude towards Yu Chen changed.\"\n\n\"Yu Chen also began to change from a former genius, steady, and precociously mature individual into a carefree playboy.\"\n\n\"The next change was to lie low, rarely going out. This is like a process of learning and growth,\" Yan Feifan added.\n\n`[Many things aren't accomplished overnight, and habits aren't changed in an instant. The difference before and after him is so huge, and there are still suspicious points in between. Brother Lu, I have a very far-fetched guess I want to share.]`\n\n\"I have one too.\"\n\nThis was Bai Hemian speaking. At this moment, all sounds in heaven and earth instantly quieted.\n\nLu Ding's surprise was no less than Liu Bei's when he heard Zhang Fei's suggestion in \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\"\n\nAnd the words were similar.\n\n\"Me too!\"\n\nIt carried an inexplicable sense of humor.\n\nLu Ding: \"Then you speak first.\"\n\nBai Hemian said with a thoughtful look and a solemn expression: \"Could Yu Chen have been replaced?\"\n\n\"Possession.\"\n\nA light breeze swept by.\n\nBai Hemian, hearing no one respond, added somewhat awkwardly: \"Alright, you two speak.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahaha...\"\n\nLu Ding and Yan Feifan's laughter rang out simultaneously at this moment.\n\nBai Hemian was utterly confused: \"What are you doing? What are you laughing at? I know it's unreliable.\"\n\n\"But didn't Feifan say he had a very far-fetched idea? I think my idea is also very far-fetched, isn't it?\"\n\nPeople who are naturally naive always inadvertently hit the key point of a problem.\n\nAt this moment, Bai Hemian had hit the nail on the head.\n\n\"Your idea is not only not far-fetched, but also highly probable!\"\n\nLu Ding said, then explained to him: \"Of course, it's not necessarily possession, it could also be similar to Tong Yong's situation.\"\n\n\"For him to make such a drastic change in a short time, there must have been an external influence.\"\n\nYan Feifan's voice came from the phone, adding.\n\n`[But we don't know what this external influence is. The Yu Family must have investigated and suspected it. Yu Chen must have shown flaws, but the Yu Family couldn't find it out.]`\n\n`[Such a large Qi Refiner family cannot all be fools.]`\n\n`[So if they can't find it out, there are only two results currently: First, Yu Chen has no problem.]`\n\n`[Second, Yu Chen has a problem, but with their methods, they can't detect it yet.]`\n\n`[Something that can't be dealt with, even knowing there's a possibility, represents the unknown and danger.]`\n\n`[But he's a Yu family member, and they can't just abandon him like that; it would dishearten other clan members. So the Yu Family's best approach is to give him the cold shoulder, marginalize him.]`\n\n`[This is to ensure that in the worst-case scenario, if other unknown situations arise, they can quickly cut ties with Yu Chen and say, 'We long ago considered him as no longer one of us.']`\n\n`[The starting point is Yu Chen's hidden injury; this is also the excuse and reason.]`\n\nLu Ding nodded, affirming Yan Feifan's words.\n\n\"The current patriarch of the Yu Family, though Yu Chen's father, also bears the responsibility for the entire Yu Family. He doesn't only have Yu Chen as a descendant.\"\n\n\"Therefore, the decision to marginalize him is the best and safest.\"\n\n`[Brother Lu, maybe Yu Chen has an old grandpa<sup>1</sup> on him, or he was really possessed, or his mind was influenced by something after all.]`\n\nBai Hemian had listened to both their analyses.\n\nHe said: \"Then should we go ask Qu Ningyan?\"\n\nLu Ding smiled and glanced at him: \"Xiao Bai, you really like beating around the bush and wasting time on fruitless efforts, don't you?\"\n\nBai Hemian didn't understand: \"Huh?\"\n\n\"And if it were so easy to find out, the Yu Family would have already found it out; it wouldn't be up to us to guess.\"\n\n\"Anything we can think of, others can certainly think of. There are many fools in the world, but there are more intelligent people. Never underestimate anyone.\"\n\n\"I dare say, even if we went, it would be a wasted trip.\"\n\n\"Then what should we do?\" Bai Hemian felt a bit dizzy.\n\nHis brain cells really didn't allow him to think so much. If he could have thought of all these things.\n\nHe wouldn't have been so foolish back then, killing a teammate directly without finding any excuse.\n\n\"I approved him for two months of study and re-education. When the time comes, I'll use that as a reason to visit and take him.\"\n\nYan Feifan hadn't talked with Lu Ding for a long time, and he was particularly energetic today, adding further.\n\n`[Exactly, why investigate? Just go directly to their door and take him. Anyway, if we find out, he's going to be arrested.]`\n\n`[Since he's going to be arrested if we find out, and he's going to be arrested if we don't, then let's just arrest him first, and then... then...]`\n\n\"Then directly bring him back to the Yunhai General Bureau. If that doesn't work, send him to the Cultivation Grounds. If we can't handle it, someone else surely can, right? We'll directly verify the truth.\"\n\nLu Ding said with a growing smile.\n\nThe main point was not playing by the book.\n\nInvestigating the cause, investigating the reason, investigating this, investigating that.\n\nIn the end, isn't the result still an arrest?\n\nIf it's not serious, then two months of reformative study.\n\nIf it's truly possession or a body swap, then directly extract and eliminate whatever is inside his body.\n\nBacked by 749, how could they not utilize it?\n\nThere are so many powerful and formidable individuals in 749. Lu Ding didn't believe they couldn't deal with him.\n\nIf you were truly that formidable, you would have ascended long ago. Why hide and conceal yourself?\n\nBai Hemian's thoughts were once again cleared, and his way of thinking instantly upgraded.\n\nPreviously, he was Lv1. After following Lu Ding for a while, he was Lv10. Now, after hearing Lu Ding's words.\n\nHe instantly shimmered with golden light, reaching Lv100.\n\nAnd said: \"So 749 can be used like this?\"\n\n\"Of course, don't just charge head-on into everything by yourself. We need to learn to utilize all available resources.\"\n\nSince Lu Ding and Yu Chen had a spark of conflict.\n\nThen Lu Ding had to extinguish this spark.\n\nIf Yu Chen was truly the original Yu Chen, no problem. Whatever he did, it wouldn't work. Even if he feigned being \"Spirit Lake\", Lu Ding estimated he concealed two realms.\n\nAbove Spiritual Sea is Divine Palace. So what if you are in Divine Palace?\n\nOne hand to crush you.\n\nLet alone two realms, even three. Take it one step further, suppose you concealed three realms.\n\nEven if you concealed a Fate-Ruling Realm, what then?\n\nIn a word, he can't cause much trouble. Lu Ding just killed a Fate-Ruling Realm today.\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> \"Old grandpa\" (老爷爷): In cultivation novels, this often refers to an ancient powerful spirit or master residing within an artifact or the protagonist's body, who guides them with their vast knowledge and power.",

    "content": "If you are not the original Yu Chen, then fine, what awaits you is the Great Han 749th Provincial Branch Bureau.\n\nOr even the General Bureau.\n\nJust what are you jumping around for, what are you hiding?\n\nJust clumsy methods, that's all.\n\nIt's their business that the Yu family didn't send you to 749 for examination.\n\nCouldn't Lu Ding just send you?\n\nAnyway, re-education through labor is the same wherever it is; if you cooperate, at most Lu Ding can send you back later.\n\nGo by plane, return by plane.\n\nHe can even book you first class, Lu Ding will pay out of his own pocket.\n\nAll for the purpose of nipping uncertain things in the bud.\n\nBut there are still many uncertainties.\n\nFor instance, a cornered dog will jump over the wall.*\n\nSo Lu Ding needs to find insurance.\n\nCall for backup!!\n\nUse his own connections to call in someone truly formidable, the kind that uses a cannon to shoot a mosquito.\n\nThe main point is to be cautious yet arrogant, to control every situation, 360 degrees, from any angle, to crush and control without blind spots.\n\nPulled out his phone and made a call, five minutes, done.\n\nThat's how connections are used.\n\nDidn't the things accumulated in the past just come in handy now?\n\nGoing it alone is only for when there's no other way.\n\nIf you have these conditions, you have to use them.\n\nLu Ding certainly didn't want to get injured or take risks for no reason.\n\n\"Who did you just call?\"\n\nBai Hemian was like a curious baby, wanting to know everything.\n\nLu Ding played coy: \"You'll know if something unexpected happens then.\"\n\n\"With you here, would there still be an accident?\"\n\nLu Ding felt very comfortable hearing that.\n\n\"Hahahaha, you've grown too, you've learned to say nice things.\"\n\nBai Hemian's expression remained unchanged: \"Huh? Wasn't I speaking the truth?\"\n\nIn his view, with Lu Ding present, there would absolutely be no accidents.\n\n\"Alright, alright, it's the truth, let's go.\"\n\nIt was hard to explain to this natural airhead.\n\nThey chatted casually with Yan Feifan and Bai Hemian along the way, and thus arrived in Yunmeng.\n\nAfter checking Yunmeng Fifth Middle School's class schedule, going too early would just mean waiting around.\n\nIt was also during this stage that, although our Feifan Ge wasn't present, he was still proving useful via phone.\n\n[Brother Lu, are you guys free right now?]\n\n[Lu Ding: More or less.]\n\nAs he spoke, Yan Feifan created a group chat with four people inside; besides the three of them, there was also Cao Ying.\n\n[Yan Feifan: @Cao Ying, quick, Brother Lu and them are in Yunmeng, hurry and recommend that restaurant you mentioned last time.]\n\n[Cao Ying: Coming, coming, Brother Lu, there's a restaurant in Yunmeng called \"Tianxia Hui,\" claiming to gather ingredients from all corners of the world, many things are treasure hunter special supply, specifically for entertaining Qi Cultivators.]\n\n[They have everything that runs in the mountains, swims in the water, and flies in the sky. I've supplied them before; I have a membership, Brother Lu, I'll send you the membership number and password.]\n\n[Once you go, just eat your fill, I'll pay for everything!!!]\n\nIn a person's life, enjoying life boils down to four big words: eating, drinking, playing, and having fun.\n\nNow that they'd arrived, Lu Ding naturally wanted to see it for himself.\n\nGathering ingredients from all corners of the world, treasure hunter special supply.\n\nJust these few words were enough to pique Lu Ding's interest.\n\nHe still remembered last time, he was supposed to eat the Angry Rooster at Cao Ying's place, but Chen Xian messed it up.\n\nThis time, he was definitely going to eat a whole one.\n\nBeside him, Bai Hemian quietly sent a message in the group chat.\n\n[Bai Hemian: Do they have that chicken leg we ate last time?]\n\nWell, he was craving that too.\n\nLast time, they left in a hurry, so they packed him a chicken leg to eat on the way; it seems he hasn't forgotten how good it was.\n\n[Cao Ying: Yes, absolutely, that's just a trifle, they have even better things there.]\n\nBai Hemian saw this message, turned his head, and said: \"Let's go, we haven't eaten since yesterday.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, you're hungry? A Divine Palace Realm cultivator gets hungry so quickly?\"\n\nBai Hemian couldn't tell that Lu Ding was teasing him.\n\nHe said righteously: \"Grandma said to keep the good habit of eating on time. Man is iron, food is steel.\"\n\nThen, his tone shifted, and he added very seriously: \"Mainly, I'm just craving it.\"\n\nOnly Bai Hemian could say these words with a straight face; anyone else wouldn't be able to.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha... Let's go, let's go, I'm craving it too.\"\n\nThe two quickened their pace.\n\nFinally, in the afternoon, they successfully arrived at Tianxia Hui in Yunmeng.\n\nUpon arrival.\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian's eyes were opened.\n\nA small island in the heart of the lake, with a villa situated there, beautiful scenery, and a gathering of birds and beasts.\n\nHandsome, beautiful, a dazzling array.\n\nVarious flowers blooming out of season.\n\nElegant, common, competing for beauty.\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian were overwhelmed, not knowing where to look.\n\nIt was as if Grandma Liu had entered the Grand View Garden.**\n\nLet's not even talk about the food yet, they haven't eaten, but just seeing these things laid out here, hey, it was truly worth the trip.\n\nThey looked around as they walked, then entered the garden.\n\nPedestrians increased, in groups of three or five, every one of them a Qi Cultivator.\n\nVery lively.\n\nSuddenly, Lu Ding pricked up his ears and listened.\n\n\"How much did you bet?\"\n\n\"Five million, betting on Lu Ding reaching third place, 1:1.1 odds. If it hits, that's ten million fifty thousand, principal and interest. What about you? I just saw you calling to borrow money.\"\n\n\"I bet thirty million on Lu Ding reaching second place, 1:1.5 odds. If it hits, that's seventy-five million, principal and interest.\"\n\n\"You guys really aren't afraid of losing, are you?\"\n\n\"Lose what? There are no fakes under a great reputation. It's stable; it just depends on what rank he can reach.\"\n\n\"Actually, I wanted to take a gamble and bet on first place, with 1:2 odds, but it was agreed that Lu Ding couldn't accumulate power when he came. If he could accumulate power, first place would be a sure thing; he wouldn't even fear a Fate Controller Realm cultivator. But now he can't accumulate power, so second place is probably his limit.\"\n\n\"Qu Ningyan, who is in first place, is Divine Palace Ninth-level. In a while, once she reaches a certain age, she'll drop off the rankings. But Lu Ding just had to come during this time.\"\n\n\"If Qu Ningyan drops off the rankings, Lu Ding's chance of reaching the top is definitely fifty percent.\"\n\nLu Ding's dominance was forged through battle after battle; although his arrival this time was almost equivalent to challenging the home ground.\n\nBut Lu Ding didn't utter any arrogant trash talk.\n\nNor did Lan Mingli maliciously promote Lu Ding.\n\nTherefore, under the concept of \"strength is respected\" in the Qi Cultivator world, quite a few people recognized him.\n\nAs for those rumors outside...\n\nRecognition is one thing; we recognize your strength, but if you come to challenge our home ground, I definitely have to speak up for my hometown people.\n\nOne's elbow can't bend outwards,*** after all.\n\nAlthough that's what they said, secretly, they were all making side bets.\n\nJust to see if Lu Ding would rush to second or third place.\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding walked over: \"Hello, excuse me, where can one buy those bets on second or third place that you just mentioned?\"\n\n\"In the dining hall, the Red Tower, it's hung on the wall. When you're eating, if you want to bet, just call a waiter. The cap is one hundred million.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay, thanks.\"\n\nLu Ding led Bai Hemian towards the Red Tower.\n\n\"Grandma said not to gamble.\"\n\nLu Ding didn't have much cash on hand, not enough to gather one hundred million. While borrowing money, he said: \"You don't believe I can reach the top? Do you want to bet a little too?\"\n\n\"I don't have money.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Bai Hemian fell silent, wondering what he was thinking.\n***\n\\* \"a cornered dog will jump over the wall\": an idiom meaning to take desperate measures when pushed to the brink.\n\\*\\* \"Grandma Liu had entered the Grand View Garden\": an idiom describing a country bumpkin overwhelmed by an extravagant or unfamiliar place.\n\\*\\*\\* \"one's elbow can't bend outwards\": an idiom meaning one should not favor outsiders over their own people/group.",

    "content": "......\n\nUpon reaching the place, they reported Cao Ying's membership number and password and gained entry.\n\nOnce inside, they saw the Talent List hanging on the wall. Next to it were the odds. A slogan was posted: Results determined by final performance.\n\nLu Ding to top the list, 1-to-2 odds; Lu Ding for second, 1-to-1.5 odds; Lu Ding for third, 1-to-1.1 odds; Lu Ding for fourth, 1-to-4 odds.\n\nThe maximum bet amount was one hundred million. Seeing this, Bai Hemiao asked, \"Why are the odds for fourth place higher than for first place?\"\n\n\"That's purely to scam fools,\" Lu Ding explained to him. \"If they dared to open the betting, they must have estimated my strength. Given I can't hold back my power, my chances of being in the top three are highest. Fourth and fifth place might be debatable, but their internal analysis shows the probability for those is smallest.\"\n\n\"So they set the odds for fourth and fifth place highest to attract fools to bet and make money.\"\n\n\"They also set a cap on the amount to prevent me from throwing the match.\"\n\nIf there were no cap, and someone bet tens of billions, and Lu Ding intentionally lost at the place with the highest odds, wouldn't Tianxia Hui lose their shirts?¹\n\n\"Are there really that many fools?\" No sooner had Bai Hemiao spoken than, coincidentally, someone in the hall was saying, \"Support! I must support my cousin in blocking Lu Ding at fourth place! I'm betting ten million on Lu Ding for fourth!!\"\n\nThe cousin this person spoke of was none other than Luo Ping, third on the Talent List. Lu Ding, playing along with the comment, spread his hands.\n\n\"See? They just reveal themselves.\" With that, Lu Ding and Bai Hemiao headed up to the second floor.\n\nFirst, two Nuqing Chickens, stewed whole, one for each of them!! Then they flipped through the menu, where a note stated: All ingredient sources are legal and compliant, and subject to all inspections and inquiries.\n\nCharcoal-grilled White Muntjac (whole)—ordered, to see what it's all about.\n\nMonkey Wine (ten-year vintage)—ordered, to see what it's all about.\n\nHundred-Year Spring Tree (thirty kinds of heavenly treasures and earthly wonders combined)\n\n\"Xiao Bai, look, it's a tree!\"\n\n\"A tree? Can you eat a tree?\" Bai Hemiao felt somewhat bewildered by what he was seeing. One's horizons determine one's imagination, and now a tree could be a dish?\n\nLu Ding didn't care about that much. The price was acceptable, and he could just exchange some contribution points for things to give Cao Ying later. He couldn't truly lose all self-control just because he was being treated.\n\n\"Order it and we'll see.\" He was also curious; could a tree really be made into a dish? Lu Ding wanted to see what it was all about.\n\nSoon, they finished ordering. Lu Ding motioned for a waiter to come over, and immediately said, \"Bet one hundred million for me on Lu Ding to top the list.\"\n\nBai Hemiao quickly added, \"Bet one hundred million for me too.\"\n\nThen, he pulled out his bank card and slapped it onto the table. SMACK!\n\nLu Ding slowly turned his head to look, slightly surprised: \"Didn't Grandma say no gambling?\"\n\nBai Hemiao straightened his posture: \"Grandma also said that men should learn to seize opportunities, not hesitate when they should act decisively. Not knowing the outcome is gambling; knowing the outcome, that's investing.\"\n\nLu Ding listened with some suspicion. How come it felt like anything could come out of Grandma's mouth whenever Xiao Bai spoke?\n\n\"Did Grandma really say that? She knows a lot, doesn't she?\"\n\nBai Hemiao: \"Grandma is quite learned.\"\n\nLu Ding believed him. He then asked, \"Aren't you broke?\" Bai Hemiao still had an explanation: \"I don't have money myself, but I just saw you borrow some, so I borrowed too. It's an investment where I know the outcome, so I can pay it back immediately. This is finance.\"\n\n\"Grandma knows finance too?!\" Lu Ding's voice rose a pitch.\n\nThis time, Bai Hemiao shook his head: \"Grandma didn't say this. You told me to read more books last time; I learned this from a book.\"\n\nLu Ding breathed a sigh of relief. Good thing Grandma didn't say it. If Grandma knew finance, then she wouldn't be Bai Hemiao's grandma. That would be Schrödinger's grandma², always in an unstable state, knowing everything, saying everything.\n\nBut. \"You shouldn't just read *any* book, why are you reading finance? What, are you going to become a domineering CEO³ and start a company?\"\n\nBai Hemiao nodded, half understanding, half confused: \"Oh~ Then I won't read finance anymore.\"\n\nHe made up his mind in his head; he'd throw these books away when he got back. There was philosophy on the bookshelf next to them. Next time, he'd read philosophy.\n\nAs the two successfully placed their bets, soon, the dishes arrived!!!\n\nA two-meter-wide platter held a whole roasted White Muntjac, and the Hundred-Year Spring Tree, carried in by several people. In front of each of them, a large clay pot was placed, each containing a whole stewed Nuqing Chicken. And Monkey Wine in jade bottles.\n\nHoly moly, time to feast! A mouthful of wine, a mouthful of meat, with chopsticks like a whirlwind and a shovel for a mouth, they stuffed it in, big mouthfuls at a time, and got right to it!\n\nAn indescribable flavor bloomed on their tongues. At this moment, Lu Ding finally understood: the days he lived before were truly bitter ones.\n\nNo wonder, among eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, eating ranks first. He had previously seen people online talk about the Engel coefficient—simply explained, it's the proportion of spending on food relative to total daily expenditure.\n\nThe lower the Engel coefficient, the wealthier the country. Other countries' coefficients were around ten-something percent. But the Great Han's Engel coefficient was thirty to forty percent.\n\nAt the time, Lu Ding had wanted to complain, and now he wanted to even more. Old Engel, do you even understand what eating is? Eating dry bread with a couple of rotten vegetable leaves every day, what do you know? You wouldn't even understand Konjac Snacks. And you're doing data research. Forget about this meal; on the Chīle Me⁴ delivery platform, a twenty-minus-nineteen coupon—who wouldn't go crazy seeing that? Do you know what 'Crazy Thursday'⁵ is?! Lu Ding thought to himself, his hands and mouth never stopping.\n\nThey ate until evening, stuffing the two brothers to the gills. They went downstairs, stood in the breeze, caught their breath, and ambled around.\n\nBai Hemiao, having drunk some Monkey Wine, had a slightly red face, liquid courage empowering him. His usual shyness was suppressed by the alcohol. His speech became a bit more uninhibited.\n\n\"I never want to eat again in this life.\" After saying this, the alcohol's effects surged back after being in the wind, and he let out a burp. Bai Hemiao rolled up his sleeves and pointed forward: \"Let's go! Let's pick up Director Ren's daughter! I'd like to see who dares to bully her today. Lu Ding, don't you make a move later; watch me.\"\n\nLu Ding followed behind: \"Slow down. Next time, I'm absolutely not taking you drinking. Slow down, that's a flower bed, don't run into it!!\"\n\nThe two of them headed towards Yunmen No. 5 Middle School just like that. They waited for a while upon arriving, and it was just dismissal time.\n\nTheir four eyes searched among the crowd for about half an hour. When most of the people had left, a girl slowly walked out, her eyes scanning her surroundings, cautious and wary. This was Ren Tong's daughter, Ren Shuang.\n\nShe walked several hundred meters away from the school gate, passing by an alley.\n\nFrom around the corner, two girls and two boys emerged with smiles, their eyes locked on Ren Shuang, seeing that another corner was not far ahead.\n\nThe boy with a cigarette in his mouth said, \"Let's go, follow her. We'll get her after the corner, where it's out of sight.\" The four followed, watching Ren Shuang walk past the corner.\n\nBut as soon as they went up. Rounding the corner, their view opened up. They saw Lu Ding and Bai Hemiao standing with their arms crossed under a streetlamp, blocking their way.\n\nRen Shuang stood timidly behind the two of them, reaching a finger out from between them to point at the cigarette-smoking boy: \"It's him! He keeps insisting I go out with him, even though I've refused many times. I told him I wouldn't go, but he bothers me every day. This afternoon, he even said he'd block me at the school gate after dismissal.\"\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: \"虧麻了\" (kuī má le) literally means \"lost until numb,\" implying a complete and utter financial ruin. \"Lose their shirts\" is an English idiom with the same meaning.\n² Translator's Note: \"Schrödinger's grandma\" is a playful reference to Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, implying someone whose state (in this case, knowledge and sayings) is uncertain and seemingly encompasses all possibilities at once.\n³ Translator's Note: \"霸總\" (bà zǒng) refers to a \"domineering CEO\" or \"tycoon,\" a trope often found in Chinese romance novels and dramas, characterized by their wealth, power, and often controlling nature.\n⁴ Translator's Note: \"Chīle Me\" (吃了么) is a phonetic transliteration of a popular Chinese food delivery platform, akin to \"Uber Eats\" or \"DoorDash.\" The name itself is a common Chinese greeting asking \"Have you eaten?\"\n⁵ Translator's Note: \"Crazy Thursday\" refers to a popular meme and marketing campaign in China, often associated with KFC's weekly promotions, where people post humorous or bizarre requests online for \"KFC Crazy Thursday\" money or food.",

    "content": "Lu Ding and Bai Hemian's arrival, Ren Tong would certainly inform his daughter.\n\nAlthough he trusted his precious daughter not to do anything unexpected or say anything untoward.\n\nBut what if?\n\nJust in case, he gave her a heads-up beforehand.\n\nJust now, when Lu Ding and Bai Hemian appeared, no extensive introductions were needed. Ren Tong had already laid out enough groundwork regarding their identities. They could get straight to the point, without needing to introduce themselves or waste time with formalities.\n\nAnd so.\n\nBai Hemian stepped forward.\n\nThese were all descendants of Qi Refiner families, and naturally Qi Refiners themselves, so they recognized the aura of a Divine Palace Realm expert. Instantly, all four felt their calves cramping.\n\n*Smack!!!*\n\nA slap was thrown over: \"Did you bully her?\"\n\nThe teenager's cigarette was slapped flying.\n\nThe other three looked at each other, thinking, this doesn't seem to concern us, he's looking for Zhai Guang, they... should we slip away? Their feet shifted, little by little, attempting to move aside.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand and waved, stirring the wind. One palm each, slapped over in sequence.\n\n\"He said him! Didn't say you! Right?!\"\n\nThe three were directly slapped into a mid-air spin.\n\n\"You... you dare hit me?\" Zhai Guang clutched his face, looking at Bai Hemian before him, fear and disbelief equally prominent in his eyes.\n\nBai Hemian's mind wasn't very quick to begin with, and having had some alcohol, hearing these words... He turned to Lu Ding, casting an inquiring glance.\n\nJust then, Lu Ding stepped up and swung a slap from the left.\n\n*Smack!!!*\n\n\"So what if I hit you!!?\"\n\nBai Hemian understood instantly. He raised his hand and slapped from the right.\n\n*Smack!*\n\nImitating Lu Ding's emphasis when speaking. \"So what!?\"\n\nLu Ding immediately followed with another slap.\n\n*Smack!!*\n\n\"So what!!?\"\n\nBai Hemian raised his hand, slapping the face Lu Ding had just slapped, back the other way.\n\n*Smack!!*\n\n\"So what!?\"\n\nAfter a dozen or so consecutive slaps, Zhai Guang, who had originally been somewhat arrogant, his eyes became clear.* He had no power to resist whatsoever.\n\nClutching his pig-swollen face, he was about to say something. Lu Ding raised a hand to interrupt him, telling him to wait. Looking at the three still lying on the ground: \"Don't play dead, get up!\"\n\n\"The three of you form a circle and slap each other in turns. Whoever goes easy, I'll slap them.\"\n\nOne of the girls looked up, saying with a fearful expression: \"Bro, I'm a girl... could I...\"\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nJust then, the figure directly flew up and crashed into the corner.\n\nAfter Lu Ding used his foot, he pointed at Ren Shuang and spoke on her behalf: \"A girl? You're a girl, and she's not a girl? When you bullied her, why didn't you think she was also a girl?\"\n\n\"Stop spouting this useless nonsense.\"\n\n\"You two! Slap away!\"\n\nSeeing that Lu Ding really did use force, kicking someone flying, the remaining two didn't dare to think of anything else. Anyone with eyes could tell. These two were typically both recklessly arrogant and aggressive.\n\nThen came the sound.\n\n*Smack-smack-smack*, the sounds of loud slaps being swung at each other flew about.\n\nLu Ding looked back at Zhai Guang again: \"Alright, your turn to speak. What were you about to say?\"\n\nZhai Guang swallowed. Stammering, he said: \"My... my brother is Zhai... Zhai Lin...\"\n\nBai Hemian grinned: \"Forget your brother Zhai Lin, even if your dad were the Heavenly King Old Man**, it wouldn't matter. Bullying the descendant of a 749 martyr.\" Saying this, he raised his hand and pointed at the sky: \"Call your dad here!!\"\n\n\"Let him watch me slap you in front of him!\"\n\nThese words were truly arrogant. Lu Ding also hadn't expected Bai Hemian, who was usually so quiet, to be so brazen with his mouth now. It seemed he was a bit drunk.\n\nZhai Guang was also stunned listening. Lu Ding swung a slap at him to sober him up.\n\n*Smack!*\n\n\"Stop gawking. You said that just to say your brother is amazing, right? Come on, point the way to your house, let me see how amazing your brother is.\" After speaking, Lu Ding looked at the other two who were still slapping each other.\n\n\"You, the one surnamed Ruan, send a message back: have your cousin Ruan Xiaoqi go to the Zhai family to wait for me immediately.\"\n\n\"Ten minutes, just ten minutes. If he's not there in ten minutes, I'll find you and break both your legs.\"\n\n\"Like this!\"\n\nAs Lu Ding spoke, he quickly raised his leg, kicking once on each side and directly breaking both of Zhai Guang's legs.\n\n\"Ah!!!!\"\n\nA pained scream rang out. Lu Ding slapped him, making his mouth fill with blood. \"Stop fucking screaming, it's annoying to listen to. Your Zhai family has plenty of ways to heal you; you'll be as good as new tomorrow.\"\n\nZhai Guang clutched his mouth, not daring to speak, watching blood trickle from between his fingers.\n\nLu Ding finally added: \"Remember, tell your cousin my name is Lu Ding.\"\n\n\"My name is Bai Hemian.\"\n\nThese words landed in their ears like a clap of thunder on a clear day. These two names were, one could say, known by everyone in the current Cloud Dream Qi Refiner circle. Who didn't know that Cloud Sea 749's Corpse-Dissolving Demon*** and Several-Time Buddha*** were coming to stir up trouble? It's just that there had been no news these past few days. Unexpectedly, they had arrived now!!!\n\nLu Ding's fierce reputation surfaced in the minds of the few. The two nodded continuously, shaking their swollen-cheeked heads.\n\nLu Ding grabbed and lifted the struggling-to-control-his-pain Zhai Guang. He said to Ren Shuang: \"Little sister, let's go, I'll uphold justice for you.\"\n\nAt this moment, Ren Shuang's eyes sparkled with crystalline light under the illumination of the lights. She had originally thought these two would also be like the people Dad had found last time. Giving a verbal warning, then saying some ineffectual words, which would only work for a few days. Things would be as they were before, and remain as they were after. She would still have to rely on herself to get through her senior year of high school to escape this place.\n\nBut she hadn't expected Lu Ding and Bai Hemian to actually resort to violence, and even drag the person along to uphold justice for her. Both her parents were Qi Refiners, and both were from 749. She, naturally, was no exception, it's just that her talent wasn't as good. That's why she knew what the surnames Zhai and Ruan represented in Cloud Dream. Precisely because she knew this, she was deeply moved.\n\n\"Thank you...\" Ren Shuang's voice carried a sob.\n\nBut she didn't say anything else, because Ren Tong had reminded her. 'If you have any grievances, tell them, but don't interfere with their decisions. Whatever they want to do, let them do it. Whatever they tell you to do, do it. They won't harm you.'\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding's image was etched into Ren Shuang's eyes and heart. For Ren Shuang, who was currently experiencing darkness, Lu Ding was nothing short of a ray of light in her life. As for her father, Ren Tong, he was her strong backing. It was precisely because of her father's support that she could touch this beam of light.\n\n\"Vent properly, clear your emotions. We'll enjoy the show later.\" Crying is normal. The way to comfort someone isn't just to say 'don't cry.' The simplest and most direct method is to make the perpetrator receive the same treatment as the victim, or several times worse. That is the best apology. Not a dry, meaningless \"I'm sorry.\" That's utterly useless. If \"I'm sorry\" worked, then there'd be no need for police officers.\n\nLu Ding swung the Zhai Guang he held in his hand and slammed him onto the ground.\n\n*Thud!!*\n\n\"Did I pick you up to make things easier for you? Point the way.\"\n\nZhai Guang, with trembling hands, pointed in the direction of home.\n___\n* \"His eyes became clear\": An idiom indicating someone has been beaten into submission, had their arrogance beaten out of them, or \"sobered up\" from their previous state of delusion.\n** \"Heavenly King Old Man\" (天王老子): A colloquial term referring to someone of incredibly high status or power, often used to dismiss their perceived authority in a given situation.\n*** \"Corpse-Dissolving Demon\" (解屍太歲) and \"Several-Time Buddha\" (幾經浮屠): These are likely distinctive nicknames or titles. \"Corpse-Dissolving Demon\" refers to a powerful and destructive figure. \"Several-Time Buddha\" suggests someone who has undergone many trials, or attained significant spiritual enlightenment through repeated experience. \"To stir up trouble\" (踩場子) means to challenge someone's authority or territory, often aggressively.",

    "content": ".....\n\nMeanwhile, Lu Ding departed.\n\nOn the other side, the Ruan family.\n\nWhen Ruan Xiaoqi received the message from his cousin, he directly bounced up from his chair. He grabbed his weapon and rushed out.\n\nThe middle-aged man was pruning flowers outside. Seeing his hurried state, he asked, \"Little brat, it's already evening, why are you taking your gear out?!\"\n\n\"Dad, Lu Ding has arrived in Cloud Dream, and he's currently on his way to the Zhai family. Ruan Ming was beaten by him, Zhai Guang was also beaten by him, Zhai Guang's leg was even broken. If I can't get there in ten minutes, Ruan Ming's leg will also be broken by him!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man listened, his expression sinking. \"Then hurry up and go. I only have one instruction for you: don't disgrace my Ruan family, but also act within your capabilities.\"\n\nAt their age, they were full of vigor and short-tempered. Coupled with Lu Ding's past deeds, the middle-aged man didn't doubt the truthfulness of Lu Ding's words at all. He only wondered in his heart, logically speaking, Lu Ding shouldn't stoop to the level of children.\n\nHow could it be that upon arriving in Cloud Dream, he first targeted Zhai Guang and Ruan Ming? How strange, I need to investigate.\n\n\"Got it, Dad!!! Remember to call Ruan Ming's parents too.\"\n\nHere, Ruan Xiaoqi rushed out while spreading the news. Before long, everyone in Cloud Dream knew Lu Ding had arrived. He was currently on his way to the Zhai family, and had also beaten the younger generations of the Zhai and Ruan families.\n\nAt this point, almost everyone had a question in their minds. Lu Ding, upon arriving in Cloud Dream, first beat up a few children? Are you kidding?!\n\nDoubts arose, but the time was too short to find anything out. So they simply stopped investigating, and one by one, filled with questions, they rushed to the Zhai family to watch the show.\n\nCloud Dream 749 also received messages from multiple parties: from Cloud Sea 749, Ren Tong, the Advanced Training Institute, etc...\n\nBasically, the gist was: the person is in your area, no matter what, keep a close eye on him. Then, regarding the reason Lu Ding acted, Ren Tong proactively explained.\n\nGood heavens. With Lu Ding's involvement, things escalated directly. Cloud Dream 749's internal order was:\n\nLeverage the situation!!\n\nTo reprimand the Cloud Dream Qi Refiner families and protect Lu Ding's personal safety. If Lu Ding did anything outrageous, they were to uniformly state that Lu Ding was not from Cloud Dream 749; they only had the right to protect a colleague. They did not have the right to try or arrest a colleague specially dispatched from another location.\n\nThe main point was: if he's at fault, we can't intervene; he's from Cloud Sea, go find Cloud Sea 749. But if anything happened to him, we absolutely had to help him bear the brunt, because like us, he carried the 749 emblem.\n\nAt this moment, Cloud Dream instantly fell into chaos.\n\nAmidst the rising winds and stirring clouds, the Zhai family, ironically, was the last to know Lu Ding was coming. This was still Ruan Xiaoqi who came to their door to tell them. By the time they reacted, they hadn't even finished discussing their countermeasures. Lu Ding had already burst through their doors.\n\nStill the old rule. Hit someone, hit their face first; crash a party, kick the door first. Coming to fight, not to give gifts or eat, no need for politeness!\n\nJust look at the Zhai family's main gate. Bang!!! It directly shattered, burst open, and flew outwards.\n\nLu Ding's voice drifted away. \"Zhai Lin, get out here and let me see how you teach your brother!?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lu Ding walked through the main gate, and a crowd of Zhai family disciples swarmed forward, blocking his path.\n\nPast the screen wall. Inside the main hall.\n\nZhai Lin and Ruan Xiaoqi sat upright, looking imposing. Seeing Lu Ding carrying their injured brother, whose legs dangled loosely, apparently broken.\n\nZhai Lin had anger in his eyes and fire in his heart. He rose and raised his hand, shouting, \"Lu Ding!! Let go of my brother!!\"\n\nAs these words fell, Lu Ding took a powerful step forward, and the Zhai Guang in his hand was suddenly flung towards Zhai Lin.\n\n\"Here, take him back!!\"\n\nThey saw a dark figure flash through the air. Carried by the force, it flew with the sound of wind.\n\nUnder the fierce momentum, Zhai Lin's heart sank; this was not an easy catch for him. But if he didn't catch him, Zhai Guang would surely crash into the wall, and with his cultivation level, he would be severely injured if not dead.\n\nThere was no other choice; he could only grit his teeth and take the hit. Just as Zhai Lin was about to get up, a figure flashed in the air, slowing down the flying Zhai Guang with a single hand.\n\nThe person who arrived was none other than the Zhai family's patriarch, Zhai Tianyuan.\n\n\"Investigator Lu, given the current situation, is there some misunderstanding?\"\n\nHe placed the injured Zhai Guang in his hands aside. Now that he was back home, Zhai Guang instantly felt like he was fine again!\n\nWith a pair of angry eyes, he stared directly at Lu Ding: \"Dad!! He hit me!!!\"\n\nLu Ding raised a finger and pointed: \"Don't yell. If you yell again, I'll hit you again later!!\"\n\n\"Lu Ding, how dare you!!\"\n\nZhai Lin couldn't stand it anymore. They were already at the Zhai family's home, and Lu Ding still dared to openly threaten his brother. He simply had no regard for the Zhai family whatsoever.\n\nZhai Lin burst forward, his three-section staff^1 trailing behind him. With a leap and a spin, the three-section staff chopped, hooked, and spun, producing a whistling sound. Then a cold pond appeared, radiating chills, four eyes gleamed with white light, and a two-headed monstrous serpent slowly revealed its heads.\n\nBut in the next second.\n\nThwack!!\n\nThe rapidly swinging three-section staff was seized by Lu Ding's bare hand at its tip. This situation was something no one had expected. Zhai Lin was so stunned he lost control of his expression.\n\nOne must know, he had practiced with this three-section staff since childhood. The weapon itself was designed to amplify force through clever techniques, and combined with his own strength and Qi, each move carried the might to withstand ten thousand men, with strength exceeding a thousand *jun*^2. How could it be casually caught by a bare hand?\n\nEnormous force transmitted through the three-section staff; it turned out Lu Ding was pulling. Zhai Lin lost control of his body and stumbled backward.\n\nLu Ding swung his arm in a sweeping chop.\n\nBang!!!\n\nA single blow to the chest made Zhai Lin feel top-heavy and light-footed, causing him to tumble through the air, seemingly about to land headfirst. It was also this single blow that made him understand just how ridiculous his so-called 'strength exceeding a thousand *jun*' truly was. The strength of the other person's single horizontal arm strike was several times greater than his full-strength effort.\n\nBefore Zhai Lin even landed.\n\nLu Ding kicked straight again!\n\nBang!!!!\n\nThe figure flew backward, crashing and embedding into the wall.\n\nLu Ding slowly stepped forward, looking at Zhai Tianyuan, and without turning his head, pointed at Zhai Guang, who was embedded in the wall.\n\n\"Unless I told you to move, just rest for me first. I'm talking to your dad now.\"\n\n\"Patriarch Zhai, your son, in collusion with others, bullied the daughter of my 749 station director. I don't want to say more; believe it or not, go investigate it yourself.\"\n\n\"I demand an explanation now.\"\n\nAt these words, Zhai Tianyuan finally understood why Lu Ding, upon arriving in Cloud Dream, didn't first seek out the talents on the Talent List, but instead targeted these younger ones. So, he came to stand up for someone.\n\nThe earlier exchange between Lu Ding and Zhai Lin also made Zhai Tianyuan understand. Only a fierce dragon crosses the river^3. Furthermore, they were clearly in the wrong beforehand, so Zhai Tianyuan didn't doubt the truth of the matter. A fake Lu Ding wouldn't dare cause such a commotion.\n\nHe asked, his expression unchanged, \"What kind of explanation does Investigator Lu want?\"\n\n\"Very simple. Hang him up and beat him for an hour. Right now, beat him in front of me.\"\n\nZhai Tianyuan's expression sank.\n\nZhai Guang, even more terrified, repeatedly spoke, attempting to fabricate an excuse, hoping to escape the situation by claiming the ignorant are innocent^4.\n\n\"Dad... Dad... I didn't... I didn't know she was the 749 station director's daughter, I didn't bully her... I...\"\n\nBefore he finished speaking, Lu Ding interrupted with a smile: \"Alright, I don't care if you knew or not; it's useless to me. The fact is, she was bullied by you.\"\n\n\"And it wasn't just once or twice. Whether you knew her identity or not, you bullied her. Not to mention, other Cloud Dream 749 investigators had warned you before.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n^1.

    "content": "......\n\n\"They lectured you about reason. Since you wouldn't listen, now I'll lecture you with fists and feet. Don't complain.\"\n\nFacts are facts. Where the hell does all this 'ignorance is no sin' come from?\n\nLu Ding's words completely blocked what Zhai Tianyuan had originally intended to say.\n\nHe opened his mouth, but the words that were almost out changed.\n\n\"Investigator Lu, our Zhai family can offer compensation to make up for this young girl's losses.\"\n\n\"Compensation? How much money can an eighteen-year-old child spend? Or do you think my salary as the director of the 749 Post isn't enough to let my daughter live a prosperous life!?\"\n\n\"Cut the crap. Are you fighting or not? If you don't fight today, fine, I'll leave immediately, and I'll come back in three months. Don't complain then.\"\n\n\"Or you can keep me here now. Do... you dare?\"\n\nWith these words, Zhai Tianyuan finally realized the seriousness of the situation.\n\nThree months...\n\nAs far as they knew, Lu Ding probably hadn't been with the 749 since joining for three months yet...\n\nWith such terrifying talent, when he returned in three months...\n\nHe would likely come with his strange charged slashes...\n\nHe dared to lay hands on Siming even in the Spirit Sea realm. In three months, who knew what realm he would be in? And if he charged up again then...\n\nZhai Tianyuan didn't dare to imagine.\n\nAs for keeping him?\n\nDon't be ridiculous. How is that different from starting a war with the 749?\n\nWithin the Great Han territory, starting a war with the 749 would be worse than waiting three months.\n\nMoreover, the problem was, they weren't even in the right!!!!\n\nThere was no way to argue. Lu Ding's few words rendered him speechless.\n\nFurthermore, Lu Ding's current attitude was that he wouldn't yield to either persuasion or force.\n\nThe more Zhai Tianyuan thought about it, the angrier he became!!\n\nLooking at his son, his anger flared up in his heart. \"Why the hell did you bully people!!?\"\n\n\"From childhood to adulthood, it's not like I haven't taught you etiquette and morals. It's fine if you mess around a bit when you grow up, but now you're putting your old man on the grill.\"\n\n\"Someone!! Bring the disciplinary rod!!\"\n\n\"Good-for-nothing, all you know is causing trouble everyday!!\"\n\nAs soon as this sentence came out, everyone knew that Zhai Tianyuan had found an excuse to back down and yield.\n\n\"Dad... Dad... I... I'm injured, don't... don't hit me... Dad!!\"\n\nNo matter how Zhai Guang cried out, Zhai Tianyuan remained unmoved.\n\nSoon, the seven-chi-three disciplinary rod arrived.\n\nZhai Guang was immediately tied up and hung from the ceiling beam. Zhai Tianyuan swung the rod, delivering a volley of cracking blows.\n\nAngry, frustrated he wasn't living up to his potential, and annoyed.\n\nPig-like squeals rang out.\n\nLu Ding grabbed a stool for Ren Shuang and had her sit down: \"Watch slowly.\"\n\nThen he turned his head to look at Ruan Xiaoqi, who had gone from sitting to standing.\n\n\"It's our turn.\"\n\nLu Ding's words made Ruan Xiaoqi's expression serious.\n\nThe gap between him and Zhai Lin was already not large. If Lu Ding could instantly defeat Zhai Lin, he could instantly defeat him too.\n\nThis battle was destined to be a defeat.\n\nBut he still had to fight.\n\nSurrendering without fighting would be a disgrace to the Ruan family.\n\nHe put away his short knife. Weapons or no weapons, it was no longer necessary; the outcome was already determined.\n\nRuan Xiaoqi raised both hands forward, clenched his fists and took a stance, his aura surging forth, wave after wave.\n\n\"I will discipline my cousin when I get back. Ruan Xiaoqi of the Ruan family, please, Jie Shi Taisui, bestow your instruction!\"\n\nLu Ding turned around to face him directly.\n\n\"What are you going to discipline? You're just a cousin. Let his parents do it.\"\n\nToday, no one would escape.\n\nRuan Xiaoqi wasted no words, stepping forward directly. The green bricks beneath his feet rippled like water.\n\nHis speed was extremely fast.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand to meet him.\n\nShoulder-arm block against the punch.\n\nRuan Xiaoqi's punch landed solidly, but he only felt as if he had struck a copper wall and iron rampart; not a shred of force could penetrate.\n\nHe changed his punching style, lowered his body, twisted his waist, then turned and delivered a 'body-sacrificing kick' with his leg, channeling all his body's strength. This was the heaviest of his martial arts offensive techniques.\n\nIt was also the most unpredictable attack.\n\nAs he kicked, Spiritual Qi adhered, and under the superposition of multiple forces, the faint outline of a guillotine blade appeared.\n\nIt chopped down towards Lu Ding.\n\nThis move had high reward, but also high risk.\n\nSure enough, Lu Ding raised his hand and grabbed it. At first glance, it looked like a bare hand grasping a steel blade.\n\nHe directly grabbed Ruan Xiaoqi's leg and swung him up.\n\nThen he slammed him onto the green bricks on the ground.\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nThe green bricks shattered, and Ruan Xiaoqi lay in a shallow pit.\n\n\"Hah... cough cough cough cough cough... I...\"\n\nHe hadn't even finished saying \"I lost.\"\n\nBai Hemian quickly went up, took out a pill, and popped it into his mouth.\n\n\"Don't play dead. It's our turn.\"\n\nRuan Xiaoqi turned his head, looking at Bai Hemian with unfocused eyes. Lu Ding's smash had completely dazed him.\n\nBoth in pain and dazed.\n\n\"You're... Bai Hemian?\"\n\n\"You're fighting too?\"\n\nHe only heard that Lu Ding was coming to fight, not that Bai Hemian was fighting too!!?\n\nWhat was going on?\n\nLan Mingli: \"Didn't know, did you? That's right, you didn't. I didn't know back then either.\"\n\nJust then, Bai Hemian took out his ID card from his bag: \"I'm not twenty yet either, why can't I fight? Get up, you're not even seriously injured.\"\n\nRuan Xiaoqi shook his head vehemently: \"No, no, no, I'm not fighting. I lost.\"\n\nSeeing him play-act and not get up, Bai Hemian frowned.\n\n\"I'll count to three for you. Time counts even when you're lying down.\"\n\n\"Three!\"\n\nRuan Xiaoqi cursed under his breath, \"Are you insane!?\"\n\n\"I already said I'm not fighting, and you're still counting to three!!\"\n\nHe rolled over and was about to run.\n\nBai Hemian lunged forward, and the two tangled in a fight once more.\n\nZhai Lin, who had been unconscious earlier, was given a pill and had just woken up.\n\nHe opened his eyes.\n\nRuan Xiaoqi flew backward and landed on the ground by his feet, his face bruised and swollen.\n\nZhai Lin looked up and saw Bai Hemian walking over with an aggressive aura.\n\nHe frowned. \"Why are you here? Where's Lu Ding?\"\n\nBai Hemian flashed his ID card: \"He already fought. Now it's my turn. Get ready. Remember, I want blood coral.\"\n\nThe newly awakened Zhai Lin hadn't even grasped the situation yet.\n\nIn a few quick moves, he was fighting with Bai Hemian again.\n\nIt was also at this moment.\n\nOutside the Zhai family's main gate.\n\nMembers of the Ruan family arrived, with a woman shouting at the top of her lungs.\n\n\"Son, son, Ruan Ming, where are you!?\"\n\nAmong the group of Ruan family members, a slightly plump woman walked at the forefront with hurried steps.\n\nRuan Ming heard his mother's voice, and tears welled up in his eyes.\n\n\"Mom! I'm here!!\"\n\n*Slap!!*\n\nLu Ding backhanded him: \"Did I tell you to speak?\"\n\nThe woman heard the sound, looked over, and just happened to see this scene. She charged forward, brandishing her claws.\n\n\"How dare you hit my son? What right do you have to hit my son? I can't even bear to hit my own son, and you...\"\n\nSomeone nearby quickly stopped her.\n\nA middle-aged man held the woman back, preventing her from charging forward, while looking over:\n\n\"Investigator Lu, we can discuss anything. If he committed a crime, we'll accept it.\"\n\n\"But you're hitting my son right now, in front of me and my wife...\"\n\n*Thump!!*\n\nLu Ding kicked Ruan Ming beside him, sending him flying and falling to the ground.\n\n\"I hit him again. What can you do about it?\"\n\n\"If you don't know how to discipline your son, I'll do it for you. If he can bully others, I can bully him. If you're unhappy, then come before me and make your move.\"",

    "content": "......\n\nThe man's expression sharpened slightly, gradually becoming serious.\n\nRuan Kong, male, forty-six years old, Siming Realm Triple, his talent was just so-so.\n\nHe was the current head of the Ruan family, Ruan Hai's second elder brother; Ruan Xiaoqi called him Second Uncle.\n\nIt was unknown how many generations of Qi Refiner he was.\n\nToday, he was verbally lectured in public by a junior, leaving him no way to save face*. Who could tolerate that?\n\nNot to mention, his son was even beaten right in front of him.\n\nJust as Ruan Kong was about to erupt, his aura surging, a meaty palm came from behind and slapped him on the shoulder.\n\nA terrifying aura, several times stronger, directly dispersed Ruan Kong's aura.\n\nThe ground cracked from the shock, and cracks spread across the walls.\n\n\"Second Brother, you're a grown man, don't stoop to a child's level.\"\n\nThe person who arrived was precisely Ruan Xiaoqi's father, also Ruan Kong's third younger brother, the current head of the Ruan family, a genuine Dichajing Realm powerhouse, Ruan Hai!\n\nRuan Kong's aura deflated.\n\nHe snorted coldly at Lu Ding. With decades of cultivation, others might fear Lu Ding, but he didn't.\n\nThey had all been through real battles.\n\nIf it weren't for Ruan Hai's slap today, he would certainly make Lu Ding see what a true Siming Realm expert was!\n\n\"The path you have to walk is still very long, don't think...\"\n\n\"Don't think that just because you've eaten a few more years of rice than me, you can lecture me. Eating more only means you're a rice bucket. Who are you showing this unconvinced and indignant attitude to?\"\n\n\"You make mistakes and don't admit them, get beaten and don't stand at attention, can't even manage your own son, and now you're trying to lord it over me. If you're really unconvinced, we 749 have a tradition of Life-and-Death Pacts and Death Match Arenas. Will you sign or not?\"\n\nLu Ding directly interrupted Ruan Kong's speech and retorted.\n\nDid he really have to wait for others to finish their lecture before retorting?\n\nWhy should he?\n\nLu Ding knew what he wanted to say; everyone knew what he wanted to say.\n\nSince that's the case, you're indignant, I'm displeased.\n\nThey were all Qi Refiners, why say so much?\n\nOne word: Fight!!!!\n\nA handprint stamped, a signature to set the rules, a gong struck, and on the stage, might determines status.\n\nAge doesn't determine seniority; only methods prove strength.\n\nFighting these children was boring. If Lu Ding was going to fight, he'd fight the big ones.\n\nClashing with each other would only waste words; the final result would be the same anyway.\n\n\"You!!!\"\n\nRuan Kong stopped mid-sentence, one word, but the surging anger within was palpable.\n\nBut Lu Ding was no pushover:\n\n\"Don't you like protecting your cub? Come on! Sign the pact and protect him right in front of me!\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lu Ding quietly flipped his hand, accumulating the Way of the Jin Che, continuously increasing its power.\n\nHe started accumulating from now, and later, once the pact was signed and the stamp was pressed, he would hack him on stage.\n\nMoreover, he was accumulating it secretly, hiddenly.\n\nWith the Unity of Heaven and Man providing cover, no one present noticed it.\n\nRuan Kong's anger surged. Sometimes the simplest goading was the most effective.\n\nHe immediately agreed, pointing at Lu Ding: \"You said it, this is what you said, sign! Sign it right now!!\"\n\nAlthough he was muddled now, Ruan Hai was not.\n\nAs the Ruan family head, his defining characteristic was his clear-headedness.\n\nLu Ding's renowned technique was known to everyone present.\n\nThe strange charged slash.\n\nHe dared to chop down a Siming Realm expert in the Spirit Sea Realm, and later, he even killed a Siming Realm expert alone. All these deeds spoke of Lu Ding's courage and meticulousness.\n\nIf he dared to provoke like this, he wasn't afraid of you accepting.\n\nGenius often couldn't be judged by common sense.\n\nRuan Hai quickly said, \"Don't lose your head!\"\n\nToday, not only people from various major families came, but Yunmeng 749 also came; they just hadn't shown themselves yet.\n\nIf a fight broke out later, whether he won or lost, it would be problematic either way.\n\nIt would be a lose-lose situation. Given such a result, why fight?\n\nRuan Kong, whose emotions were already explosive, heard this and pointed at himself, \"I've lost my head? I've lost my head!\"\n\n\"He's practically cursing me to my face, and you say I've lost my head!?\"\n\n\"You can be arrogant in Yunhai, but this is Yunmeng!\"\n\nThis last sentence was directed at Lu Ding.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding didn't like talking trash, since the invitation had been extended...\n\n\"You just talk nonsense. I'm giving you a chance, but you're useless. You're as useless as your son.\"\n\nThis covered both father and son directly.\n\nThen Ruan Kong's wife also flared up!\n\nYou can insult my husband, but you can't insult my son!!\n\n\"Husband, go! Give this brat a good lesson!!!\"\n\nWith that, she quietly leaned in: \"He hasn't charged up.\"\n\nRuan Hai glared at the woman fanning the flames. He knew he couldn't dissuade his second elder brother now.\n\nIn a voice only they could hear, he spoke softly: \"You can fight, but don't cause a death. Do it carefully, otherwise, the Ruan family will have a hard time later.\"\n\n\"Hmph, I know. This brat is too arrogant. I'll teach him a lesson, but I won't take his life!\"\n\n\"He thinks he can yell at me just because he defeated a few Siming Realm experts. Today, I'll show him what a true Siming Realm expert is.\"\n\nWith that, Ruan Kong stepped forward, looking at Lu Ding again: \"Let me make this clear. If you lose, today's matter with my son will be written off completely.\"\n\n\"If I lose, you can do whatever you wish?\"\n\nHe was very confident. Lu Ding's renowned technique was a slash.\n\nBut he hadn't charged up a slash now; Ruan Kong saw it clearly.\n\nHe inwardly thought Lu Ding was being arrogant.\n\nTreating him like those ordinary Siming Realm experts.\n\nTo summarize in one sentence: As long as the knife isn't at their throat, everyone thinks they can do it!\n\nHaving eaten rice for a few more decades, everyone thinks, you're young, so you should bow down to me.\n\nThe future belongs to you, but the present belongs to me!\n\nBeing a full major realm higher, in the understanding of ordinary Qi Refiners, each step is a new heaven; a realm's difference is a world of difference.\n\nAll these conditions combined inflated Ruan Kong's confidence.\n\nAnd also provided the prerequisite for his demise.\n\nAmong his peers, he wasn't a prodigy, but bullying a junior...heh...\n\nLu Ding ignored him. He had said enough today. He turned to look at the Zhai family head, just about to ask for paper and a pen.\n\nWho knew.\n\nBai Hemian, who always carried paper and pen, ran over.\n\nHolding up a white paper.\n\n\"Life-and-Death Pact.\"\n\nIt turned out that just now, while Lu Ding was speaking those words, he had already started writing.\n\nOn the white paper, the handwriting flowed like dragons and snakes, powerful and vigorous.\n\nOutside the Zhai family residence, a man in a 749 management uniform walked over.\n\n\"Since the Life-and-Death Pact is a tradition of my 749, it's not too much for me, the Deputy Director of Yunmeng 749, to be a public witness, is it?\"\n\nEveryone looked over at the sound. The person who came was indeed the Deputy Chief of Yunmeng 749.\n\nQiu Si.\n\nHe strode powerfully, and Lu Ding greeted him: \"Hello, Deputy Bureau Chief Qiu.\"\n\nQiu Si smiled and nodded: \"Seeing you makes me even better.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he extended his hand, intending to shake hands.\n\nLu Ding reached out, and just as their hands met, a voice sounded in his mind.\n\n【The Yunmeng Qi Refiner families are becoming increasingly arrogant. This Ruan Kong, in particular, has repeatedly disobeyed management both openly and covertly. Some others in other families are also suspected of being in cahoots with the Heavenly Principle Cult.】\n\n【Currently, there's a need to strike the mountain to scare the tiger**. Sign the Life-and-Death Pact, directly kill him to disrupt the situation. Afterward, I will give you an excellent spiritual material, and I will bear all the consequences.】\n\nThe two exchanged a glance and smiled, having reached an agreement.\n\n---\n*   \"leaving him no way to save face\" (下不来台): lit. unable to get off the stage.\n**  \"strike the mountain to scare the tiger\" (敲山震虎): lit. striking the mountain to startle the tiger, meaning to make an example of one to warn others.",

    "content": "...\n\nThe handshake lasted only a few seconds before breaking apart.\n\nQiu Si picked up the life-and-death pact, slamming Yunmeng 749's steel seal onto it.\n\nLu Ding signed, Ruan Kong signed.\n\nBoth pressed their handprints together.\n\nQiu Si held the life-and-death pact high.\n\n\"The life-and-death pact has been signed. Life and death are determined by fate, wealth and honor by Heaven.\"\n\n\"Everyone else, clear the area!!\"\n\nQiu Si's imposing aura surged forth, forcing everyone else to clear a path. Only Lu Ding and Ruan Kong remained standing in the center.\n\nHe gathered Qi around his body to guard against a sneak attack from Lu Ding, then said: \"I don't care if you...\"\n\nBefore he could finish the four words, an ancient stone tablet fell from the sky.\n\nOn it were inscribed three large characters: Shi Gandang.^1\n\nIt directly crushed the Qi Ruan Kong had accumulated on his body.\n\nAlong with his entire being, it pressed him directly onto the ground.\n\nLu Ding's long-accumulated slash erupted in an instant.\n\n\"You talk too much!!\"\n\nHeaven and earth were filled with sharpness. The invisible slash, carrying the characteristics and aura of slaying all, cut directly out.\n\nTerror was deeply hidden within it. One didn't need special comprehension to grasp its intent.\n\nSlay, destroy!!!!\n\nDivide all!!!\n\nTwo consecutive moves, both arriving instantly, one control, one attack, combined in a powerful combo.\n\nIn Ruan Kong's eyes, emotions intertwined, and in his daze, two words were visible, one on the left, one on the right: \"sneak attack.\"\n\nEveryone present's expressions changed drastically in an instant.\n\nLu Ding wasn't charging up, was he!!!?\n\nHow could he unleash such a powerful and bizarre slash just by raising his hand?\n\nMy apologies, Lu Ding has upgraded and iterated.\n\nIn the Spirit Sea realm, his power accumulation could be seen by you. Now that he's in the Divine Palace realm, if it could still be seen by you...\n\n...then what would be the point of him ascending to the Divine Palace realm?\n\nAt any time, one must hold back a trump card.\n\nThis current move was something Lu Ding had been hiding since ascending to the Divine Palace realm.\n\nRuan Hai didn't have time to process the situation. He directly raised his hand to save, his aura exploding, causing the air to crackle.\n\n\"Wait!!\"\n\nHis Earth Insight Realm Fifth Stage aura erupted, but before he could take a second step,\n\nhe had only taken one step out.\n\nAn even more terrifying aura surged to meet him!!\n\nA figure instantly teleported and shifted to block in front, seizing his outstretched hand.\n\n\"You dare to stop me!!!\"\n\nQiu Si, Deputy Director of Yunmeng 749, Earth Insight Realm Ninth Stage. Years ago, someone used a limerick to describe him:\n\nLife-Severing, Soul-Urging Hand;\nQuick to Indulge in Favors and Grudges.\n\nThis \"quick\" doesn't mean anything else; it's literal. Quick to repay favors, quick to exact revenge.\n\nRuan Hai was suppressed, looking beneath the Shi Gandang tablet.\n\nThe stone tablet stood firm, acting as a boundary.\n\nFrom the front, Ruan Kong was split in two from the top of his head. The tablet left a mark, but it wasn't severe.\n\nFrom the back, Ruan Kong's legs twitched and kicked; his soul had already departed for the Western Heavens, only muscle memory remained active.\n\nLu Ding dispersed the Shi Gandang tablet.\n\nIf this weren't the Zhai family's residence, Lu Ding, fearing his slash might burst out and cut too far, wouldn't have even bothered using the Shi Gandang tablet to suppress Ruan Kong.\n\nWas it for suppression?\n\nNo!\n\nIt was to block his own slash, to prevent it from cutting too far.\n\nLest he be unable to afford compensation for houses, and also harm innocents.\n\nAt this moment, the venue was silent.\n\nAll eyes turned to him, filled with apprehension.\n\nCunning, too cunning!!!\n\nHe actually hid his power accumulation!!!\n\nAnd there's this stone tablet that suppresses but doesn't kill? Why did no one mention it before?\n\nIn the main hall, Ruan Xiaoqi and Zhai Lin, who had originally sat up to watch the show, now saw this scene and, with perfect understanding and without a word, lay back down.\n\nClosing their eyes, they slept with exceptional serenity.\n\nOh dear, I'm injured...\n\nNearby, it was the Earth Insight Realm's turn to take center stage.\n\nQiu Si's eyes seemed to pierce through people's hearts as he stared directly at the suppressed Ruan Hai.\n\n\"Yunmeng 749's life-and-death pact, signed and sealed, and I even stamped it with the steel seal. That means life and death are determined by fate, wealth and honor by Heaven. You... were you trying to provoke 749 just now!!!!\"\n\nBoom!!!!\n\nBloody wolf smoke shot straight into the sky, obscuring clouds and blotting out the sun.\n\nIt outlined a ferocious one-horned ghost face, fangs exposed, replacing the moon's position, looking down from above on everything beneath the sky.\n\nRuan Hai let out a muffled groan.\n\nThe hand gripped by Qiu Si gradually turned red then purple.\n\n\"Answer me!\"\n\nQiu Si's voice rang out again. With a 'crack,' Ruan Hai's hand bones shattered, and blood overflowed from the corner of his mouth.\n\nHe gritted his teeth, not allowing the blood to spray out.\n\nHe said with difficulty: \"I did not!!\"\n\nAs soon as he spoke, the one-horned ghost face in the sky dissipated, and Qiu Si reined in his aura.\n\nHe raised a hand and slapped a single sheet of paper onto Ruan Hai's chest.\n\nThis made him stumble back two steps, letting out a long breath, his forehead covered in fine sweat.\n\nUpon seeing the paper, Ruan Hai's pupils contracted slightly.\n\nQiu Si looked at him, saying in a voice only the two of them could hear: \"I'm giving you some face. I believe you didn't. We're old acquaintances, but as for others in your Ruan family, you can see for yourself.\"\n\n\"Go back and manage your Ruan family members well. Don't think that just because there's an old geezer who just broke through to the Heaven Insight Realm, you can act arrogant. If you piss me off, once I take off my epaulets, I'll deal with your whole family!\"\n\nWith his epaulets on, he is Yunmeng 749's Deputy Director.\n\nWithout his epaulets, he is the Life-Urging, Soul-Severing Hand, who would carve through 800 *li*^2 of Yunmeng Marsh just for a single word.\n\n749 has had a rule since ancient times:\n\nThe Director is omnipotent, omniscient, and all-encompassing; the Deputy Director kills all, annihilates all, indiscriminately.\n\nRuan Hai stared at the paper in a daze. After a long while, he replied aloud.\n\n\"I understand. I'll deal with it when I get back.\"\n\n\"Then go back now. Are you waiting here for me to invite you to dinner?\"\n\nRuan Hai turned to leave, but Qiu Si called out to stop him: \"Remember to send the due heaven-and-earth treasures to Yunmeng 749, two portions!\"\n\n\"Deliver them in half an hour.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Ruan Hai finally spoke in a voice everyone could hear: \"Xiaoqi, let's go.\"\n\nRuan Xiaoqi, lying on the ground, slowly climbed up, limping silently behind him.\n\nLu Ding watched him, casting a bewildered look at Bai Hemian.\n\n'Did you cripple him?'\n\nBai Hemian was puzzled. The two exchanged glances.\n\n'No, I just gave him a few punches—hit his stomach, his head, his chest, but not his legs...'\n\nLu Ding was puzzled, and Bai Hemian didn't understand either.\n\nIt was also at this moment that two servants from the Zhai family came over, each carrying a tray.\n\nOn them were two exquisitely packaged heaven-and-earth treasures.\n\nThey were the Heart-Penetrating Bamboo Fruit and the Moon-Worshiping Orchid.\n\nOne could assist in cultivation and comprehension, its effect similar to a much-weakened Union of Heaven and Man.\n\nThe other was a rare realm-fortifying tonic.\n\nBai Hemian raised his hand to take the slightly lesser Moon-Worshiping Orchid, but who knew Lu Ding was a step faster, taking the Moon-Worshiping Orchid into his possession.\n\nLooking at the Heart-Penetrating Bamboo Fruit, Bai Hemian said very seriously: \"That one's better.\"\n\n\"It's useless to me.\"\n\nLu Ding had Union of Heaven and Man; he only needed the realm-fortifying tonic. Giving him this Heart-Penetrating Bamboo Fruit wouldn't even be adding flowers to brocade.\n\nBut for Bai Hemian, it was an incredibly rare good thing.\n\nHearing Lu Ding say this, Bai Hemian didn't stand on ceremony, directly accepting it and saying: \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"I never noticed before, you're quite polite?\" Lu Ding said, turning his face.\n\n\"Didn't I learn it from you?\"\n\nBai Hemian added.\n\n\"This time it wasn't Grandma who told you?\"\n\nBai Hemian thought for a moment: \"Grandma said it too. I just forgot before.\"\n\nSo you never used to say thank you!?\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n^1 Shi Gandang (石敢當): A stone tablet, often inscribed with these three characters, traditionally placed in front of houses or at crossroads in China to ward off evil spirits and bad luck.\n^2 *Li* (里): A traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly equivalent to 0.5 kilometers or 0.3 miles.",

    "content": "......\n\nWhat happened at the Zhai family quickly spread throughout Yunmeng.\n\nWhatever about \"fourth\" or \"fifth\" place; previously, people were concerned about that issue, but now they only discussed one thing.\n\nLu Ding has evolved again!!\n\nBefore, his charging was visible; now, you can't see it when he charges.\n\nJust today, just moments ago, at the Zhai family, Lu Ding once again slew a Fate. That Ruan Er from the Ruan family was directly overwhelmed by Lu Ding with a suppressive strike and a crushing blow.\n\nInstantly killed on the spot!!\n\nMoreover, Lu Ding has now revealed a new method.\n\nA stone tablet inscribed with Shi Gandang.\n\nAlthough for Lu Ding, this wasn't new.\n\nBut for Yunmeng's talents, it was indeed the first time they knew Lu Ding possessed this method.\n\nJust listen to the discussions outside.\n\n\"Regarding Lu Ding's stone tablet, I heard from those who witnessed it firsthand that it only suppresses, doesn't kill, and is incredibly hard.\"\n\n\"Let me put it this way: Ruan Kong from the Ruan family, a Fate realm expert, was suppressed with a 'bang' when the huge stone tablet descended. Lu Ding's terrifying charged slash, when it struck the stone tablet, didn't leave even a single mark.\"\n\n\"What kind of fight is this? One slash can be charged, only offense, no defense. One stone tablet can suppress people, only defense, no offense.\"\n\n\"He's got integrated offense and defense. He's like a diesel-powered tank; fighting us is like fighting ordinary people. What can ordinary people do against a tank, huh?\"\n\n\"We thought Lu Ding came to stir up trouble*, but it turns out he came to crush the weak**. Besides Qu Ningyan, who else has a record of defeating a Fate? There's no way to fight him***.\"\n\n\"My thirty million!!! I bet on Lu Ding to be second, and it's gone!!\"\n\n\"Isn't the fight not yet happened?\"\n\n\"What's the difference?! Can Yu Huai take on a tank?!\"\n\n\"You're right, comparing Lu Ding to a tank, the only thing he's missing is an engine installed on him.\"\n\nAs the news of Lu Ding killing Ruan Kong spread even more widely.\n\nInside the Luo family manor.\n\nLuo Ping, in a white dress, folded her arms: \"No, I'm not fighting. Isn't this a guaranteed loss? That Lu Ding treats all opponents equally, regardless of gender. I don't want to be beaten into a pig's head in front of so many people.\"\n\nThe Luo family head also felt for his daughter.\n\n\"Alright, alright, you won't fight. He's just a little monster. It's not shameful for us to concede. I'll have someone send two portions of heavenly treasures and earthly delights over later.\"\n\nLuo Ping looked at him: \"Two portions? Why?\"\n\n\"You probably don't know, Bai Hemian is also going to fight. Zhai Lin and Ruan Xiaoqi both went for a rematch, but Lu Ding didn't strike too heavily.\"\n\nHearing this, Luo Ping thought for a moment.\n\n\"I can choose not to fight Lu Ding, but I want to fight Bai Hemian. Our family's heavenly treasures and earthly delights can't just be given away like this.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, my dear daughter. Then I'll send one portion of heavenly treasures and earthly delights over, and incidentally send a challenge to Bai Hemian.\"\n\nSuch a situation was also happening simultaneously at the Yu family.\n\nUnder the moonlight.\n\nYu Huai practiced swordplay, his movements elusive, his sword techniques cunning.\n\nA 'Moon-Scooping Style' strike swept out, bringing with it rampaging sword qi. He pointed his sword at the sky, his fighting spirit flickering between extinguishing and reigniting in his eyes.\n\nApplause sounded from nearby: \"Our Yu family's Water-Repelling Sword Art has been perfected**** by you. Although you have no chance of winning against Lu Ding, who has both offense and defense, you should have a good chance against Bai Hemian.\"\n\nYu Huai retracted his sword and looked towards his father.\n\n\"If possible, I really would like to fight Lu Ding once...\"\n\nYu Jun, seeing that his son was having inappropriate thoughts, immediately doused him with cold water.\n\n\"Can you break Lu Ding's stone tablet?\"\n\nYu Huai:.....\n\nAlthough his Water-Repelling Sword Art was sharp, that stone tablet couldn't even be shattered by Lu Ding's own charged slash. It would be a ghost's chance if he could break it.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Can you block Lu Ding's slash?\"\n\nYu Huai:......\n\nBefore, he had confidence because he felt that if Lu Ding didn't charge, his slash might be just so-so, and its power might even be inferior to his sword qi.\n\nBut now that the Zhai family incident was out, they knew some of the details.\n\nBeing able to accumulate such a terrifying slash in a short time meant that it only had such an effect in a short time because its inherent power was great.\n\nBased on the power of Lu Ding's charged slash, even if its power was reduced tenfold, Yu Huai might not be able to block it.\n\nNot to mention Lu Ding's physical body was also very formidable, and he had various spells.\n\nHe continued to shake his head.\n\n\"Sigh, Huai'er, it's good to have ideas, but don't aim too high. If you can't reach it, then you're being overly ambitious*****.\"\n\n\"You are a genius in the Yu family, but there are many geniuses like you in 749. They can all cultivate to the Spiritual Ocean Realm within a year. And it's these same geniuses who uniformly call Lu Ding a genius.\"\n\nThe reason why 749 could solidify its status as enforcers.\n\nIt was supported by these individual geniuses. Cultivating to Spiritual Ocean in a year, for these 749 investigators, it was only a matter of time.\n\nFrom a large base, only a small portion emerges. Those who can reach Spiritual Ocean in a year are all one-in-ten-thousand geniuses.\n\nAmong these one-in-ten-thousand.\n\nAnother Lu Ding emerged.\n\nWhether it was combat power or development speed, they were things ordinary people wouldn't even dare to imagine.\n\nIt's not shameful to concede to him.\n\nBut!\n\nOnly limited to Lu Ding.\n\nAs for Bai Hemian... we're all geniuses. You can't beat Lu Ding, I can't beat Lu Ding, we're all on the same line.\n\nIt's one thing for Lu Ding to be arrogant, but what right do you have to be arrogant!?\n\n\"Dad, send one portion of heavenly treasures and earthly delights to 749, and incidentally issue a challenge to Bai Hemian.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding had already been elevated by these Yunmeng talents to a position higher than theirs. Slaying Ruan Kong also confirmed that Lu Ding should not contend with their generation.\n\nGo on up, you!\n\nGo play with the older generation, don't come and mess with us.\n\nIt was silently acknowledged that Bai Hemian was the real opponent for this challenge.\n\nAt the other end of the Yu family manor.\n\nYu Chen waited and waited, but Old Shui didn't return. He sent messages, but received no reply.\n\nAfter inquiring everywhere, Minshan City's 749 had cleaned the scene thoroughly again, and kept the news tightly under wraps.\n\nThey didn't reveal a single bit of information.\n\nAt that time, there was no one else near the charitable graveyard/funeral home.\n\nThis made Yu Chen somewhat agitated.\n\nHe had some suspicions in his heart, but he wasn't sure if Old Shui had been detained, killed, or if something else had happened.\n\nReasoning by common sense.\n\nA Fate realm expert, Minshan City couldn't possibly handle completely. Even if provincial 749 personnel arrived, they shouldn't just kill him outright, right?\n\nYu Chen had reminded him at the time to treat everyone according to their status******, and Old Shui's EQ and IQ had always been online.\n\nHe had thought of all kinds of situations, but he just hadn't expected Lu Ding to not play by the book*******.\n\n\"Where on earth did he go!!!\"\n\nOn the other side.\n\nAfter leaving the Zhai family.\n\nQiu Si looked at Lu Ding: \"Aren't you curious about the Heavenly Principle Cult? They came for you, after all.\"\n\nLu Ding stepped back half a pace and then shifted sideways, shielding Vice Bureau Chief Qiu in front of him.\n\n\"I just stand here, and I'll deal with challenges as they arise********.\"\n\nOf course, he knew the Heavenly Principle Cult wouldn't let it go, but so what?\n\nAs if anyone doesn't have backup.\n\nOn the surface, Lu Ding had a big shot in front of him. Covertly, Lu Ding had an even more formidable one behind him who hadn't appeared yet.\n\nYunmeng is a big stage; if you want to die, come.\n\nThe Heavenly Principle Cult has been spoiled so much they can't tell who's boss********* anymore.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha...

You have a brain and aren't impulsive, stronger than I was in my youth.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a 749 investigator walked over from the side, holding a box.\n\nHe opened it.\n\nInside was a blood-stained head, full of silver needles stuck into it.\n\nQiu Si reached out and lifted it, and the head spoke.\n\n\"Jingshan mission failed. Target has reached Yunmeng. Current situation is chaotic, advantageous for fishing in troubled waters. Come quickly.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Qiu Si placed the head back into the box.\n\n\"The Heavenly Principle Cult members previously tried to use the internet to transmit coded messages, which we cracked.\"\n\n\"Later, they acted like primitives, using carrier pigeons to send messages, which we shot down.\"\n\n\"Then their methods escalated to sending messages via burning incense, which we also intercepted.\"\n\n\"Now they've even resorted to using people as messengers, and they were still discovered and beheaded by us. We sustained their life with a secret technique, muddled their consciousness, and obtained the desired information.\"\n\n\"These fools, always hiding their heads and tails, infiltrating everywhere, they just won't die off completely.\"\n\nLu Ding listened, and only asked one question: \"Bureau Chief Qiu, so where did this message come from?\"\n\nAs he finished speaking.\n\nQiu Si raised his hand, channeled his Qi, and pointed at the head.\n\nA scene appeared before their eyes.\n\nInside the room, a woman was sitting, a man standing.\n\n\"Qu Kai, can you do me a favor?\"\n\n\"Sister Ningyan, what are you saying? Anything you can say, anything I can do.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I'd like to ask you to deliver a message for me to the Zhou Family Butcher Shop. Just say the Jingshan mission failed...\"\n\nAs Qu Ningyan continued speaking, Qu Kai's gaze gradually became muddled.\n\nHis figure became unsteady, beginning to sway.\n\nUntil Qu Ningyan said: \"Remember, this is something you yourself want to spread. You haven't seen me. Your mother is from the Lan family and is also a member of the Heavenly Principle Cult.\"\n\n\"It was she who seduced your father into marrying into the Qu family, and it was she who led you to join the Heavenly Principle Cult. For all these years, you've been lurking in the Qu family...\"\n\nQu Kai repeated Qu Ningyan's words: \"I haven't seen you... I haven't seen anyone... It's something I myself want to spread...

    "content": "...\n\nQiu Si raised his hand, withdrawing his technique:\n\n\"‘See, these Heavenly Principle Cult members can be this stupid, thinking they can use petty tricks and minor arts to pass messages while avoiding suspicion.’\"\n\n\"‘Instead of being a perfectly good Qu Family Prodigy, a Yunmeng Talent, they choose to be a lackey for the Heavenly Principle Cult.... Hahahahahahaha......’\"\n\nDeputy Bureau Chief Qiu smiled wryly.\n\nThe Qu Family was considered one of the top families in Yunmeng, practically the Overlord of Yunmeng.\n\nWhether it was resources or cultivation techniques, they were beyond reproach, beyond picking apart.\n\nAs for whether you succeeded or not, that was entirely up to individual talent.\n\nQu Ningyan's talent was indeed excellent, otherwise she wouldn't have dominated the Yunmeng Talent rankings as number one.\n\nYet, someone like her would actually join the Heavenly Principle Cult.\n\nThough everyone has their own aspirations, this aspiration of yours is ridiculously off the mark.\n\nBai Hemian couldn't understand. If he had those connections and resources, he would have no idea where he'd be by now, probably wishing he could bury himself in arduous cultivation every day.\n\nLu Ding was too lazy to understand. Time, location, type—the three elements.\n\nNow that it was confirmed this person harbored ill intentions.\n\nThere was nothing more to say; it was time to prepare and act directly.\n\nBut then again, it might not be the right opportunity yet.\n\nFor him personally, it was simple: get the evidence, find Qu Ningyan, and obliterate her directly.\n\nBut for the local authorities, with the Heavenly Principle Cult involved, it wasn't that simple.\n\nThe current situation was that the Heavenly Principle Cult was known to be targeting Lu Ding, so the best course of action was to catch a turtle in a jar.\n\nSet a trap.\n\nAnd let the Heavenly Principle Cult members fall into it.\n\nHowever, there was a problem now: the messenger was gone. The message wouldn't be delivered, or the messenger wouldn't return.\n\nBoth the Heavenly Principle Cult and Qu Ningyan would notice.\n\nLu Ding wasn't a god; of course, he couldn't calculate everything.\n\nBut as long as the main point was correct, that was enough.\n\nQu Ningyan had to die. If she died at someone else's hands, Lu Ding wouldn't be at ease. What if something went wrong?\n\nTherefore, Qu Ningyan had to die by his hand.\n\nLu Ding opened his mouth to ask, \"Bureau Chief Qiu, what do you plan to do?\"\n\nQiu Si beckoned to the side, and a female investigator walked over.\n\nThey watched as she raised her hand and gently patted her neck, her head instantly shifting sideways and being held in her right hand.\n\nWith her left hand, she grabbed Qu Kai's head and placed it on her neck.\n\nThe moment it was placed on.\n\nWhoa!\n\nHer body instantly transformed into that of a man.\n\nWhen she spoke, it was in a man's voice: \"Investigator Lu, my Young Miss's life will now be in your hands, won't it?\"\n\nMm!! It's a perfect likeness! Too similar! It's practically identical, even the cultivation level is the same. Of course, this realm is backward-compatible*.\n\nThis investigator's cultivation was originally higher than Qu Kai's.\n\nLu Ding scrutinized her. Besides the scent being slightly off, there were no other flaws.\n\nHowever, this minor flaw would be almost unnoticeable if one hadn't personally witnessed the head-swapping.\n\nA very minor flaw, almost negligible.\n\nAlright.\n\nLu Ding had learned something new again. From now on, if something smelled off, he'd just attack first and ask questions later.\n\nMeanwhile, Bai Hemian next to him was staring dumbfounded. You can swap heads?!\n\nSeeing one silent and the other surprised.\n\nQiu Si was very pleased. Although his subordinate investigators weren't as strong in talent and terrifying in combat power as Lu Ding.\n\nWhen it came to skills, they each had their unique strengths.\n\n\"‘Later, Xiao Hua will replace Qu Kai and return to the Qu Family to report to Qu Ningyan.’\"\n\n\"‘What if Qu Ningyan harms ‘him’ and destroys the body to erase all traces.....’\"\n\nLu Ding went straight to the crux of the problem.\n\nThey watched as the female investigator's head, held in ‘Qu Kai’s’ hand, began to speak:\n\n\"‘It's alright, Investigator Lu, such a thing might not happen. Even if she does, don't I still have a head at the bureau? My body can regrow, it just takes a bit longer.’\"\n\nLu Ding stared straight at her.\n\nHe pondered how he would deal with someone like this if he encountered them.\n\nXiao Hua felt a chill down her spine, even using a respectful honorific: \"‘Please don't look at me like that, I'm not as resilient as you think. Many things can still counter me, like your cleaving strikes.’\"\n\n\"‘If I'm shattered by your cleaving strikes, my body probably won't grow back, and I'll die within a short time.’\"\n\nThis point, however, exceeded Lu Ding's expectations.\n\n\"‘Why?’\"\n\n\"‘I don't know. My instincts tell me what I can withstand and what I cannot. So far, your cleaving strikes are the most threatening of all the attacks I've ever encountered.’\"\n\n\"‘If it shatters, it truly shatters.’\"\n\nXiao Hua's words made Lu Ding think of the description of the Jinche Way: nothing it cannot cut......\n\nBefore death, it's an injury, and injuries can recover. But once dead, it's truly dead.\n\nThe gold content of the Nanshan Stubborn Stone was still rising.\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding was reassured. In the future, when taking action, he had to add another rule.\n\nAny enemy he killed had to be minced into fine pieces, and even separated into fatty and lean bits, and pure gold cartilage.\n\n\"‘Alright, go quickly. We'll await your news.’\"\n\nQiu Si instructed.\n\nXiao Hua turned and walked into the darkness.\n\n\"‘Next, it's time for us to set up an inescapable net and quietly await our prey.’\"\n\nQu Ningyan had to die, and the Heavenly Principle Cult members had to die too.\n\nSo, let her live for another day or two. We'll round them all up then.\n\nCoincidentally, during this period, Lu Ding could go to the Yu Family to see what was truly going on with Yu Chen.\n\nAfter the Yu Family matter was handled.\n\nThe Heavenly Principle Cult members would probably have arrived by then.\n\nLu Ding thought for a moment, then told Bureau Chief Qiu about his suspicions regarding Yu Chen.\n\nAfter listening to the whole thing.\n\nQiu Si pondered and said, \"‘I hadn't noticed this point before, but for just the two of you to go would be a bit too dangerous. I'll go with you.’\"\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian couldn't afford any accidents.\n\nIf, as Lu Ding said, Yu Chen was hiding something, or had been replaced by something else.\n\nThen.....\n\nWhether fighting or fleeing, neither of them would be able to control the situation.\n\nOne must know, if it were true, then this was something even the Yu Family's Earth Insight Realm practitioners couldn't detect. The two of them were still too outmatched.\n\nJust as Lu Ding was about to say that he had already called someone.\n\nHe heard voices emerging from the darkness nearby.\n\n\"‘Go take care of your own business. I'm here. Too many people will only cause trouble.’\"\n\nQiu Si's heart jumped. Someone was so close to him, and he hadn't even noticed? Could it be a Heaven Insight Realm practitioner?!\n\nThe three looked towards the darkness.\n\nA kindly human face emerged from it.\n\nQiu Si immediately cupped his hands in greeting and, along with Lu Ding and Bai Hemian, called out, \"Elder Deng!!\"\n\nThat's right, the person Lu Ding had called was none other than Elder Deng.\n\nOriginally, he had wanted to call and ask who was stronger, Instructor Li or Deputy Bureau Chief Chu, so he could choose the stronger one to call over.\n\nBut when Elder Deng asked, Lu Ding told him.\n\nElder Deng: \"‘Wait, I'm coming. I'm stronger than both of them.’\"\n\nWhen asked about his realm.\n\nElder Deng: \"‘They are both Earth Insight. I am Heaven Insight.’\"\n\nWell, Lu Ding was stunned. The big shot was right by his side.\n\nNow, seeing Elder Deng appear, Qiu Si smiled rather wryly. He had been worried that Lu Ding and his companions couldn't handle it, but it turned out they had called in this veteran Heaven Insight Realm practitioner.\n\nThe Yu Family had truly incurred misfortune.\n\nMeeting these two youngsters.\n\nOriginally, he thought that for him, an Earth Insight Ninth Layer practitioner, to go would be the absolute peak. Who knew a Heaven Insight practitioner would show up?\n\n---\n*   **Backward-compatible (向下兼容)**: In this context, it implies that a practitioner with a higher cultivation realm can perfectly mimic or function at a lower cultivation realm without any loss of ability or detection.",

    "content": "The wolf pretends to sleep to lure the enemy.\n\nWho could have imagined, behind the Divine Palace was Heaven’s Observer.\n\nDirectly skipping the Fate Controller and Earth’s Observer realms.\n\nThis level of caution was just too outrageous.\n\n“Since that’s the case, I won’t go and make a fool of myself. I wish you all a good time. If there’s any news, I’ll send it to your phones to notify you.” Qiu Si said, a smile on his face.\n\nThat’s right, just having a good time.\n\nWith a Heaven’s Observer realm protecting them, what else could this be but fun?\n\nNo matter what tricks or schemes you employ, in the end, it’s futile.\n\nA single Heaven’s Observer can resolve everything.\n\nStable, too stable!\n\nQiu Si even inwardly hoped that Yu Chen genuinely had something on him, or that he had been replaced by something else.\n\nWhen it came time to fight for his life, his aura soared, he uttered harsh words, and then Elder Deng of the Heaven’s Observer realm walked out and slapped him back to reality...\n\nJust thinking about it, Qiu Si found it amusing.\n\nUnfortunately, he wouldn’t be able to see this scene.\n\nAs Qiu Si left.\n\nLu Ding spoke to the darkness, “Elder Deng, you’ve arrived?”\n\nAlthough he knew Elder Deng might have arrived, the elder hadn’t shown himself before, so Lu Ding hadn’t dared to confirm.\n\nNow it was confirmed.\n\n“If something’s happening to you, of course I’d come. Have you been wronged at all?”\n\nThose words warmed their hearts.\n\nBoth Lu Ding and Bai Hemian shook their heads.\n\nWronged? Only others were getting wronged.\n\nBai Hemian looked at Elder Deng, very surprised: “Are you that powerful?”\n\nHe had absolutely no idea Elder Deng possessed such abilities before.\n\nElder Deng smiled faintly, shaking his head slowly: “Not powerful. I’m old, getting on in years. The future world belongs to you young ones. I’m just an ordinary Heaven’s Observer.”\n\nLu Ding: ...... Look at what you’re saying, I can’t even refute it. What an ‘ordinary’. Just like a certain big shot who doesn’t care about money and has no interest in it.\n\nBai Hemian was also silenced by those four words, ‘ordinary’.\n\nHe had thought Elder Deng was just a kind, gentle old man in charge of logistics, with a bit of connections, someone everyone would speak to nicely.\n\nNow that he thought about it.\n\nHeaven’s Observer realm..... Of course, people would speak nicely to him, wouldn’t they? No wonder he was able to get himself a chance to atone for his crimes then...\n\nNow that the person was confirmed to have arrived. It was time to go to the Yu family. Delays cause problems; the time to act was now.\n\nLu Ding grabbed Bai Hemian by the collar and shot up into the air.\n\nElder Deng vanished into the darkness, following close behind.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nStill the Yu family.\n\nThe night was deep. Yu Chen tossed and turned, unable to sleep, gazing at the crescent moon in the sky.\n\nMelancholy filled his heart.\n\n“People today don’t see the moon of ancient times; this moon has shined on ancient people...”\n\nA smile appeared on his face, he shook his head, then sighed helplessly.\n\nYu Chen, also known as Lin Chen.\n\nYu Chen was the current physical body, Lin Chen was the soul from the past.\n\nAll of this had to be traced back to when Yu Chen was eleven years old.\n\nThat year, Yu Chen and his older brother Yu Huai went to play in the river, one hiding, one chasing.\n\nAccidentally, Yu Chen stepped on something sharp, cutting his foot. The boy’s blood, containing spiritual energy, unsealed Lin Chen’s remnant soul hidden within.\n\nLin Chen thus took over Yu Chen’s physical body. Up until now.\n\nAs for Lin Chen himself, he was originally a Heaven’s Observer realm Qi Cultivator who dominated an area centuries ago. By chance, he obtained a fragmented dragon horn. After centuries of planning, he successfully cultivated a wicked dragon. He intended to help it carry the rivers to the sea, and after its success, use the wicked dragon’s essence to repair the dragon horn. However, at Sanjiang Estuary, he ran into people from 749.\n\nWith the ocean so close, Lin Chen had no retreat. He could only engage in a bloody battle with the people from 749, and in the end, he and the wicked dragon were both slain.\n\nA century of planning turned to naught.\n\nLin Chen, whose physical body was destroyed, did not die. The dragon horn saved a wisp of his remnant soul, which then drifted with the currents until it inexplicably arrived in Yunmeng.\n\nAt that time, what Yu Chen stepped on was precisely the dragon horn, which contained Lin Chen’s remnant soul.\n\nPerhaps he had been dormant for too long and hadn't immediately adjusted upon waking. This was why Lin Chen, after possessing Yu Chen’s body, seemed somewhat different from before.\n\nLater, as he gradually learned about current affairs, he slowly adjusted his persona.\n\nPerhaps it was due to the inherent lechery of dragons, or perhaps a habit from his previous life, but Lin Chen’s weakness for being attracted to women remained unchangeable.\n\nThis was how he ended up clashing with Lu Ding.\n\nNow that he hadn't returned when he went out, Yu Chen felt uneasy.\n\nBut if he were to leave now, Yu Chen was a bit unwilling.\n\nIf he left the Yu family, there would be no ‘sisters’ to provide him with free heavenly treasures and earthly delights to nourish his remnant soul.\n\nNor would there be such a safe place for him to hide.\n\nThe reason Yu Chen’s cultivation realm didn’t increase before was because of the remnant soul.\n\nNow that his soul’s injuries were stable and the day of rapid cultivation growth was approaching, how could he bear to just leave?\n\nWhat’s more, there were two ‘sisters’ here.\n\nYu Chen had some thoughts in his mind.\n\n“Although my current cultivation is temporarily at the Spirit Sea, with my previous methods, ordinary Divine Palace cultivators are no match for me.”\n\n“Although I can’t defeat a Fate Controller realm, I have a secret flying technique to escape!”\n\n“As for Earth’s Observer... using the dragon horn to flee, I can also get away.”\n\n“If it were a Heaven’s Observer...” Thinking this, Yu Chen chuckled to himself. It was too unrealistic. Why would a Heaven’s Observer realm Qi Cultivator target a minor Spirit Sea cultivator like him?\n\nNewbie village, encountering a max-level BOSS, how could that be possible?\n\nYu Chen assured himself he hadn’t exposed anything. Even if some flaws were revealed, the people who came wouldn’t be Heaven’s Observers, nor would they be able to detect his problem.\n\nTherefore, all problems were not problems as long as there wasn’t a Heaven’s Observer realm present. And Qi Cultivators of the Heaven’s Observer realm wouldn’t be that idle.\n\nHe just needed to focus on developing peacefully and quietly wait for his cultivation to grow.\n\nHaving a chance to start over, this time! He must be steady!!\n\nStay steady, develop steadily!\n\nJust as he was thinking, footsteps reached his ears.\n\nIt seemed the person was in a hurry.\n\nA young girl walked over and called out, “Young Master, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian have arrived. The family head wants you to come over.”\n\nYu Chen: ????? Yu Chen checked the time; it was already midnight. Were these two not resting at all?\n\nThey just finished fighting at the Zhai family and came to the Yu family. And why call him over? He couldn’t fight anyway. Strange...\n\nYu Chen didn’t think too much about it. When one lives under someone’s roof, one must bow one’s head. What’s more, this was his nominal father. He stood up: “Let’s go.”\n\nOn the other side, inside the Yu family’s main hall.\n\nFine tea was served. Lu Ding sat, holding a teacup.\n\nBai Hemian frowned beside him, looking a bit displeased.\n\nIt turned out that just now, when the two arrived and met Yu family head Yu Jun, he had said something.\n\n“Hahahahaha, Investigator Lu, Investigator Bai, have you received the challenge letter so quickly?”\n\nLu Ding then asked what challenge letter.\n\nIt turned out they said that the heavenly treasures and earthly delights for the Talent List change had already been sent to Lu Ding. But Yu Huai still wanted to fight Bai Hemian.\n\nHearing this, Bai Hemian turned to look at Lu Ding, thinking. As expected of you, conquering without battle. Then he reacted. Huh? Wait! What does this mean? Are they treating me like a soft persimmon?",

    "content": "A knot of irritation formed in his heart.\n\nBai Hemian immediately shot a glare at Yu Huai, who was sitting beside the Yu Family Head.\n\nYu Huai didn't back down, raising his eyes to meet it.\n\nAs their gazes met, sparks almost flew.\n\nOnly Lu Ding and the Yu Family Head remained silent. Otherwise, these two would immediately come to blows.\n\nBeside them, Patriarch Yu, Yu Jun, watched Lu Ding while sipping his tea.\n\nJust now, Lu Ding had said he needed to find Yu Chen to handle some matters. He'd been seated for a while now, and Yu Jun had thought hard, but he couldn't recall Yu Chen leaving the house recently. By all accounts, he shouldn't have provoked Lu Ding.\n\nBefore he could even open his mouth to ask, Yu Tao, seated on the same bench, couldn't help but ask, \"Investigator Lu, what brings you to see my younger brother Yu Chen today?\"\n\nYu Tao, the Yu family's second young mistress, was also Yu Chen's second elder sister.\n\nLu Ding didn't conceal anything. He set his teacup down.\n\n\"When I was handling matters in Minshan City previously, your younger brother Yu Chen first incited others to secretly photograph classified 749 operational information. According to the Qi Cultivator Management Regulations, I assigned him two months of re-education*. Now I'm here to pick him up.\"\n\nThe moment these words left his mouth, the atmosphere in the room instantly fell silent.\n\nYu Jun's hand, holding the teacup, clenched slightly.\n\n\"No way.\"\n\nAnother female voice spoke up. This time it was Yu Zhiyu, the Yu family's eldest young mistress.\n\nLu Ding half-turned his face, casting a glance. \"Are you implying I've wronged him?\"\n\nAlong with his voice came an invisible sense of oppression.\n\nYu Zhiyu found it difficult to speak, asking, \"Can we... discuss this?\"\n\n\"Do you think 749's laws are open for negotiation? Or perhaps, Miss Yu, you're not familiar with 749's Qi Cultivator Management Regulations and would like to experience some re-education yourself?\"\n\nAs he spoke, someone entered from outside.\n\nYu Chen strode in, his gaze sweeping over everyone in turn, finally landing on Lu Ding.\n\n\"This must be Lu Ding, right? No!!!\"\n\nIt was just that one glance. Yu Chen's heart seized with alarm.\n\nHow could he possess the aura of a Baleful Dragon**?!\n\nSeeing the main party arrive, Lu Ding stood up. Getting straight to the point, he said, \"Yu Chen, come with me.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\nYu Chen already felt uneasy. Under other circumstances, at another time, he certainly wouldn't be like this. But now, he could sense the aura of a Baleful Dragon emanating from Lu Ding. The Baleful Dragon and he had no shallow connection. He had personally witnessed the Baleful Dragon's demise; clearly, so many years had passed, and by all accounts, it should have long since dissipated. Yet now it had reappeared.\n\nIf Lu Ding hadn't been with 749, Yu Chen wouldn't have been so flustered; he would've simply considered it a fortuitous encounter for Lu Ding and planned to seize it later. But as luck would have it, Lu Ding *was* with 749. And judging by the posture, it was clearly aimed at him.\n\nThis was a classic case of a guilty conscience.\n\nElder Deng's voice echoed in Lu Ding's ear: \"He's flustered.\"\n\n\"To 749 for re-education. You assigned people from Min's Yi Zhuang to secretly photograph classified 749 operational information, then had Shui Shi come to me demanding I release them, provoking 749. With these multiple crimes combined, two months of re-education isn't excessive, is it?\"\n\nAt this point, Yu Chen instantly understood everything. No wonder Elder Shui hadn't replied to his message. He looked up, his expression grave, an unbidden wrath clouding his face.\n\n\"Investigator Lu, how is Elder Shui now?\"\n\n\"He threatened a 749 investigator, and furthermore resisted arrest. I killed him. On the spot. Beat him to death.\"\n\nLu Ding spoke with a light tone.\n\nYu Chen took it all in. His emotions churned inwardly, not showing on his face, yet he harbored deep resentment. In these past few years, while his cultivation had stagnated in the Yu family, Shui Shi had been both an elder and a protector, ensuring his peaceful growth. And now, he had been so casually killed by Lu Ding! How could Yu Chen not feel resentment and hatred in his heart?\n\nBut he dared not show it now. Because he was not yet strong enough. He could only bear it for now, quietly awaiting the day his cultivation recovered; then, he would surely flay Lu Ding alive!!!\n\nBut for now, he still had a problem to face.\n\n749, to go or not to go?\n\nIn the past, Yu Chen would have certainly laughed freely, turned around, and followed Lu Ding without a second thought. But now. He suspected Lu Ding was definitely targeting him, and with the appearance of the Baleful Dragon's aura, all these conditions combined... he couldn't go to 749; going meant more bad than good. But if he didn't go, he'd have to face Lu Ding right here and now...\n\nWith no other options, Yu Chen could only turn his head to look at his elder sisters, his eyes betraying a plea for help.\n\nThis tactic, Yu Chen had tried a hundred times with a hundred successes, and now, it was no exception. Following his gaze, Yu Zhiyu and Yu Tao simultaneously rose.\n\nLu Ding tilted his head to look. If either of them dared to intervene, he would directly suppress them.\n\nBut before they could even straighten up, Patriarch Yu, Yu Jun, let out a loud roar: \"Sit down!!!\"\n\nThe might of his Earth Insight Realm*** erupted, directly pinning the two women to their seats, rendering them unable to move or speak.\n\nYu Jun stood up. \"Investigator Lu, my apologies. Please trouble yourself to properly discipline this disappointing son of mine.\"\n\nThe moment these words were uttered, they almost certainly represented the Yu family's stance.\n\nYu Chen's eyes widened in disbelief. His laughter echoed, turbulent. \"Hahahahaha, the Yu family! What a Yu family! I think I'd be better off not staying here. If I die in 74...\"\n\n\"You talk too much.\"\n\nAt that moment, Yu Chen was still deluding himself, attempting to provoke others' emotions through words. Who knew Lu Ding would act directly, grabbing him in one swift motion. Yu Chen saw his plan fail, cursing inwardly. He couldn't just let Lu Ding take him, so he could only unleash combat strength that didn't match his current realm, striking out with a palm.\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nUnder the collision of their palms, Yu Chen spat blood. Using the force, he flew backward, escaping towards the sky.\n\n\"Lu Ding!!! This grudge, I, Yu Chen, have noted. I will repay it a hundredfold someday!!\"\n\nSeeing him actively draw out the battle, Lu Ding sighed inwardly; this truly saved him a great deal of effort. He then flew off after him.\n\nWitnessing this scene, Yu Huai turned to his father and said, with a relieved tone, \"As expected.\"\n\nThe Yu Family Head's hand, holding his teacup, trembled.\n\n\"Sigh...\"\n\nThe scene shifted.\n\nHigh in the sky.\n\nYu Chen continuously accelerated his soaring speed. He turned his head to look back, but Lu Ding was nowhere in sight. A smile appeared on his face.\n\n\"In terms of cultivation realm, I'm temporarily not your match, but when it comes to mastery of arcane arts, you should see me as seeing a god, Lu Ding. I will come back for you.\"\n\nHe knew Lu Ding could fly, but so what? Lu Ding hadn't been cultivating for long, and his realm had increased rapidly. This indicated that most of his time was spent on realm cultivation. And flying secret techniques were notoriously difficult to learn and master. Even if your talent, Lu Ding, was terrifying, allowing you to quickly pick up flying secret techniques, you spent a great deal of your time on realm, physical body, and combat power. This was widely known; how proficient could he be in flying secret techniques?\n\nA person only has so much time; with an even distribution, there would be strengths and weaknesses. This was Yu Chen's experience-based insight; he had never seen an all-rounder!!\n\nBut just because he hadn't seen one didn't mean it didn't exist. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible, but with a 'cheat'**** active, you never knew.\n\nJust then, a dark shadow descended from the sky, a foot stamping down directly onto Yu Chen's waist. Under the immense force, a *crack* sound was heard. Yu Chen's spine snapped, his body bent backward. He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, and when he twisted his head to look at his attacker, his eyes were filled with disbelief.\n\nThen Lu Ding's sarcastic voice rang out: \"A god? What a weak god.\"\n\n---\n*   **Re-education**: In Chinese context, \"学习改造 (xuéxí gǎizào)\" often implies a period of forced study and ideological correction, a disciplinary measure.\n**   **Baleful Dragon**: \"孽龙 (nièlóng)\" literally translates to \"evil dragon\" or \"sinful dragon,\" conveying a sense of malevolence or misfortune. \"Baleful\" captures this well.\n***   **Earth Insight Realm**: \"地察境 (Dìchá Jìng)\" refers to a specific cultivation realm or stage.\n****   **'Cheat'**: \"挂 (guà)\" is a slang term, especially in online gaming, referring to using unauthorized software or exploits to gain an unfair advantage (a \"hack\" or \"cheat\").",

    "content": "\"He... how did he catch up to me...?\"\n\nThis doubt arose in Yu Chen's heart, growing larger and larger, assaulting his understanding.\n\nWashing away his centuries-old worldview.\n\nShattering his so-called empirical knowledge.\n\nCould someone's talent truly be terrifying to this extent?\n\nOmnipotent, omniscient, without any shortcomings or flaws...\n\n\"I don't believe it!!!!\"\n\nAs Yu Chen let out a roar, blood surged against the flow, his aura rapidly soared, rising level by level from the Spirit Sea Realm.\n\nLu Ding plunged down fiercely.\n\nHis hands went back, the apertures in his palms opened, and with the gushing of Flesh Fiend, they provided further impetus, instantly raising his speed by another notch.\n\nYu Chen, who had just reversed his posture and straightened his twisted spine, was hit squarely in the face by a heavy punch.\n\n*Crack!!!*\n\nUnder the terrifying force of the punch, the direct hit caused Yu Chen's face to cave in.\n\nThis was just the beginning.\n\nAfter one punch, a storm-like barrage of continuous strikes followed.\n\nFists, feet, elbows, knees.\n\n*Bang bang bang bang bang...*\n\nNo matter how formidable he was before, now he was just a failure barely clinging to life, hiding within the body of an ordinary Qi Refiner!!\n\nFor this reason alone, Lu Ding would not fear him!!!\n\n*Bang!*\n\nLu Ding delivered another punch, but this time it was firmly caught by a bloody, mangled hand with twisted sinews and bones.\n\nLooking at Yu Chen's current realm, he had already ascended to the Life Executor Realm.\n\nIt must be said, he was indeed worthy of being a Heavenly Observer Realm expert previously, able to block Lu Ding's punch even at the Life Executor Realm.\n\nIt's just that his current appearance was somewhat wretched.\n\nHis entire body had no intact flesh, and his face was the hardest-hit area.\n\nFlesh torn, white bones exposed, various fractures, indentations, protrusions.\n\nEven one of his eyeballs had been knocked out by Lu Ding and was hanging on his face.\n\nYet, even so, he remained arrogant.\n\n\"Hee hee hee... I was once a Heavenly Observer Realm cultivator, do you think attacks like yours can kill... Argh!!!!!\"\n\nA scream echoed once more.\n\nIt turned out that Lu Ding's eyes had instantly condensed Essence Devouring Death Ray.\n\nTwo dark-red beams of light burst directly from his eyes; at such close range, Yu Chen had no time to react at all.\n\nHe had also not expected Lu Ding to possess such a bizarre divine ability.\n\nThe dark-red Essence Devouring Death Ray directly struck Yu Chen's eyes, and amidst the profuse bleeding, his flesh was instantly vaporized.\n\nLu Ding violently shook free from the hand that had seized him.\n\nHe used both hands to firmly grasp Yu Chen's head, gleefully and wantonly increasing the output of the Essence Devouring Death Ray.\n\nA sizzling sound rang out, accompanied by Lu Ding's rampant arrogance.\n\n\"Scream!!! Come on, scream again!!!!\"\n\n\"You were a Heavenly Observer before, if you're so capable, be a Heavenly Observer now, hahahahahahaha!!!!\"\n\nLu Ding's smile was somewhat crazed.\n\nSince you're not in the Heavenly Observer Realm now, then I'm hitting *you* right now!!\n\nThe dark-red Essence Devouring Death Ray from his eyes thickened again, just as his eyes were about to pierce through Yu Chen's brain.\n\nSuddenly, Buddhist chants resounded in bursts, and golden lotuses floated in the sky.\n\nA powerful ripple burst forth, breaking Lu Ding's hold on Yu Chen. He remained suspended in the air, no longer resembling a human.\n\nBut the expression on his face was exceptionally serene.\n\nHe raised his hand to form an Orchid Finger Mudra, and behind him was a Bodhisattva image.\n\nHis opening words carried the Lion's Roar.\n\nAnd his tongue blossomed into lotuses.\n\n\"The Heavenly Observer Realm is my past, a fact that cannot be erased. If you do not enter the Heavenly Observer Realm, you cannot comprehend my terror. Now that the Bodhisattva image has formed, Lu Ding!! Are you ready to die!!?\"\n\nLu Ding also remained suspended in the air.\n\nThe dark red in his eyes gradually receded, and a faint wisp of white smoke diffused from them.\n\nThey had been a bit overheated just now.\n\nNow he watched Yu Chen showing off.\n\nA smile spread across Lu Ding's face.\n\n\"A former Heavenly Observer really is different; you didn't die even after all that hitting. Your life is tough enough. But do you know why I, famous for my slashes, didn't use slashes to attack you?\"\n\nThe question was thrown out, and Yu Chen actually took the bait, asking Lu Ding, \"Why?\"\n\n\"Of course, it's because I prepared a surprise for you.\"\n\nLu Ding spread his hands: \"I wonder if you, a former Heavenly Observer, can block a current Heavenly Observer Realm expert.\"\n\nSince Old Deng had come, how could Lu Ding let the elder's trip be in vain?\n\nHitting him first was to vent anger. Now that the other person had gained momentum, if he went up again, it would mean he wasn't thinking straight.\n\nAsking for trouble.\n\nThe main point was, I can hit you, but if you hit me, I'll call for help.\n\nAt this moment, darkness descended.\n\nThe world, illuminated by Buddhist light, instantly darkened.\n\nYu Chen subconsciously looked up and saw a thousand-meter-tall phantom standing tall against the sky.\n\nIn front of it, both Yu Chen and the Bodhisattva image behind him appeared so minuscule.\n\n\"If I hadn't seen the Bodhisattva's Flower-Holding Technique, I really wouldn't have recognized you, my defeated opponent.\"\n\n\"Deng Guofu!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nYu Chen's facial expression instantly spiraled out of control.\n\nMillions of doubts coalesced into rage, assaulting his reason!!!!\n\nWhy! Why!! Why!!!\n\nWhy is Deng Guofu here!!\n\nWhy did I encounter him back then, and now encounter him again!\n\n\"Why do you keep stopping me again and again and again, why!!!\"\n\nHe was killed by Deng Guofu back then.\n\nAt that time, he was full of heroic spirit, making friends everywhere, believing that the world was vast and he could go anywhere as long as he didn't touch taboos.\n\nBut just as he was helping the Evil Dragon to carry rivers and flood seas, Deng Guofu gave him a saber strike right to his face.\n\nThat saber strike severely wounded him, making him shed his arrogance and impetuosity, and forcing him to recognize the harsh reality.\n\nNow it was Deng Guofu again.\n\nAnd he no longer recognized him at all.\n\nHe only recognized the Bodhisattva's Flower-Holding Technique!!\n\nHumiliation, utter disgrace!\n\nYu Chen raised a finger to the sky: \"Deng Guofu!! I will.......\"\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nOld Deng's palm descended, directly shattering both the person and the Bodhisattva's Flower-Holding image.\n\nHe then added: \"A defeated opponent is not worthy of yapping wildly in front of me. That day I gave you a saber strike to shed your arrogance, today I give you a palm strike to see reality clearly.\"\n\nLu Ding's smile spread, becoming unstoppable, accompanied by a cutting remark: \"Hahahahaha, you weren't good enough back then, and you're even worse now.\"\n\nThe double damage, both physiological and psychological, caused Yu Chen's body to continuously shatter in the air, while his soul power pulled the fragmented flesh, continuously reconstructing it.\n\nAnd then it shattered again.\n\nAfter several such repetitions, Yu Chen's injuries were restored as good as new, a momentary recovery before death<sup>1</sup>.\n\nHe believed all his plans were perfect.\n\nAs long as it wasn't a Heavenly Observer who came today!\n\nAs long as it wasn't Deng Guofu who came today!\n\nAs long as... as long as...\n\nA gaze filled with complex emotions was cast, cracks appeared and crawled all over his skin, and his words, one by one: \"Deng Guofu, I f*** your.........\"\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nLu Ding raised his hand and unleashed a slash, directly shattering the person and causing his last unspoken word to be forever stifled.\n\nYu Chen's words were interrupted by Lu Ding many times in a row.\n\nEven in death, he died with regret. Although he had many regrets, his greatest regret was probably not being able to verbally \"greet\" the mother of his lifelong enemy before he died.\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> Literal translation of 迴光返照 (huíguāng-fǎnzào) is \"return of light to reflection,\" an idiom describing a temporary resurgence of vitality or lucidity just before death, often seen as a final flicker of life.",

They even called in the Heavenly Observation Realm just on a suspicion.\n\nThese matters, one by one, filled him with suppressed anger no matter how he thought about them.\nAnd they were frantically exposing his old secrets.\nYu Chen's body perished, and his spirit died too.\n\nThis time, the Dragon Horn could no longer protect him. After Yu Chen's physical body and remnant soul had both dissipated.\nA black object floated in the air.\nIt flew straight towards Lu Ding.\n\nHe raised his hand, not to collect it, but to unleash spiritual qi, to block and resist.\nWho knew if Yu Chen had left any hidden tricks before he died.\nWar spoils weren't so easy to collect either.\nAnyway, if it were Lu Ding, before he died, he would definitely frantically poison his own things, apply curses, and spells.\nTo give those people who like to loot corpses without using their brains a little taste of what's coming to them.\n\nElder Deng watched, his expression instantly becoming genial.\nWhat a smart child.\nHe knew that things that weren't his shouldn't be taken casually.\n\nHe raised his hand and drew the Dragon Horn over to inspect it. After confirming it was alright, he handed it back to Lu Ding.\n\"No problem. If I'm not mistaken, this should be a Dragon Horn. It was what sustained Lin Chen's last wisp of remnant soul.\"\n\nDragon Horn—what these two words meant didn't need further explanation.\nMoreover, its efficacy was obvious to all.\nIt could actually sustain the remnant soul of a Heavenly Observation Realm cultivator, keeping him from dying.\n\nOf course, these weren't the most crucial points. The key was that ever since Lu Ding got hold of this thing,\nthe spiritual qi within his body was wildly surging.\nThe Fiendish Dragon was frolicking, wildly circulating the spiritual qi through his meridians and acupoints.\n\nNow that the Dragon Horn had been inspected by Director Deng, Lu Ding also felt relieved.\nHe directly opened his acupoints, and a suction force emanated from within, pulling the Dragon Horn in.\nInside his body, the Fiendish Dragon, which had been waiting for a long time, received the Dragon Horn without a moment's hesitation.\n*Crack*, it snapped off its own single horn.\n*Thwack*, it attached it to its head.\nThis was also a ruthless and decisive fellow.\n\nThen the Fiendish Dragon's aura weakened for a moment, then instantly surged!!\nIts scales rolled and shed, transforming.\nFrom its original bright black, it became a matte black, full of texture, with mysterious glowing patterns flowing across it.\nThose patterns started from the Fiendish Dragon's eyes and continuously spread backward.\n\nOriginally, the Fiendish Dragon wasn't some benevolent good thing.\nIt could be entirely summed up by \"judging a dragon by its looks.\"\nNow with this Dragon Horn attached, it gained even more strangeness and ferocity, adding a touch of domineering ruthlessness.\n\nWatching it gurgle black smoke in his meridians,\nLu Ding raised his hand, and as spiritual qi was released,\nblack smoke was mixed within.\nLu Ding: .......\nHard to describe.\n\nIf he were to fight later, and people didn't know his background, if Lu Ding told them he was from 749, they probably wouldn't believe him.\nWhich official force's good guy sends out plumes of black smoke with a raise of their hand?\nThis was almost a stereotype: when good people appeared, the sky always brightened.\nWhen he appeared, the sky immediately turned black.\n\n\"Truly clever, can use it as soon as you get it. Unlike Lin Chen, who had it for so many years and couldn't use it. Good things given to him were all wasted.\"\nDirector Deng was still praising, his eyes narrowing, full of genial warmth.\nAs if he couldn't see the black smoke on Lu Ding's hand at all.\nBut putting other things aside, the emotional value provided was simply excellent.\n\nLu Ding extinguished his spiritual qi.\n\"Thank you, Elder Deng, for coming all this way.\"\n\"Why thank me? My old bones can still play a part and do things for you all. I'm already very happy.\"\n\nElder Deng thought for a moment, feeling these words sounded a bit too official.\nPulling away from Lu Ding.\nHe added: \"And to be able to fight an old subordinate who I defeated before, it makes me feel young again.\"\n\"Hahahahahahaha......\"\n\nLu Ding didn't expect Elder Deng to have such a humorous side. So, finding the feeling of youth meant fighting someone he had defeated in his youth again.\n\n\"Speaking of which, Elder Deng, who exactly is this Yu Chen?\"\n\"His real name is Lin Chen, he used to be ......\"\n\nOnce the question was asked, Elder Deng, being old, couldn't stop once he started talking. The two flew back while chatting.\nLu Ding also learned from Elder Deng's mouth.\nIt turned out that Lin Chen had interfered with the Fiendish Dragon Bone Seal he cultivated.\n\nLu Ding listened, occasionally responding to the elder.\n'Oh, that's how it is?'\n'At least it had some use, didn't die in vain.'\n'Isn't that just pure trash?'\n'You're still ruthless!'\n'Him? Does he even deserve it?'\n'You truly are *that*.'[^1]\nHe gave a thumbs up, making the old man very happy.\n\nWhen Lu Ding returned to the Yu family, Elder Deng retreated into the darkness.\nIn the living room,\nBai Hemian was still sitting upright, his cuffs torn, slightly frayed.\nLooking at Yu Huai, his face was bruised and swollen, one eyelid so swollen it covered his eye.\nHe was a veritable disposable cyclops.\n\n\"What kind of look is this?\"\nLu Ding walked in and asked.\n\nBai Hemian's eyes couldn't hide his pride, a slight curve on his lips, but his overall expression remained calm.\nHe straightened his sleeves, then stood up: \"Had a spar with him.\"\n\nWho spoiled him?!\nStill treated him like a pushover.\nIf I don't teach you a lesson, you really won't know the difference between you and me.\nAlthough we are both beneath Lu Ding, that's only because there's still a vacant position above us.\nOtherwise, you'd have to rank from here all the way to Yunhai.\n\nLu Ding looked at Yu Huai, who seemed quite miserable.\nHe wanted to laugh, but he was a professional; he could hold it in.\nYou really don't understand the value of being a guaranteed entry.\nIn Yunmeng, in the Yu family, you're a one-in-ten-thousand genius. But at the 749 advanced training ground, a group of one-in-ten-thousand geniuses fought Bai Hemian alone.\nHe could not be at a disadvantage and even fight back.\nRun if he wanted to, fight if he wanted to.\nIf a fist doesn't land on you, you really don't know what a hidden blow is.\n\nFeeling Lu Ding's gaze,\nYu Huai sniffed back his slowly flowing nosebleed.\nHe stood up and cupped his fists: \"Investigator Lu... Was that person...?\"\nLu Ding shook his head at him.\n\nThen he looked at Patriarch Yu, who had been silent.\nIt seemed he was in the same posture when Lu Ding left and when he returned.\nAlthough it was still the same person, his figure clearly seemed to have stooped a bit.\n\n\"Patriarch Yu... You should have also noticed. I won't say more explicitly, but I hope what happened here remains confidential...\"\nYu Jun's previous actions were smart, and Lu Ding would naturally preserve his face.\nThe words \"confidentiality\" coming from his mouth were different from the Yu family making such a decision on their own initiative.\n\nYu Jun's face showed a slightly forced smile that flashed and was gone in an instant.\nAfter the change, his attitude became even more gentle, which meant he accepted Lu Ding's goodwill.\nHe nodded: \"Thank you, Lu Taisui. We've certainly been poor hosts this time. I, Yu Jun, guarantee that not a single word of what happened here will be leaked.\"\n\nLu Ding responded with a smile.\nHe called out: \"Let's go, Xiaobai.\"\nBai Hemian stood up.\n\nYu Huai saw him about to leave and called out: \"Bai Hemian, I will challenge you again!!\"\nBai Hemian tilted his head in thought, then couldn't think of anything, so he could only look at Lu Ding.\nLu Ding leaned in and whispered a few words.\nThen Bai Hemian's body remained still, his face half-turned, only showing his profile as he responded: \"I will give you time to catch up, until you are beyond reach.\"\n\n---\n[^1]: \"You truly are *that*\" (您真是那個): A colloquial expression, often used to express a strong, usually positive or awe-struck, sentiment about someone's exceptional quality or ability, implicitly acknowledging their unique nature, often with a hint of humor or admiration for their ruthlessness/skill.",

    "content": "... ...\n\nYu Huai stood rooted to the spot, clearly dumbfounded.\n\"Hahahahaha...\"\nLu Ding was seen striding away, laughter coming from outside the door. He was still quite polite, only laughing once he had gone out.\nBai Hemian followed behind.\n\nAt this moment, Yu Huai regained his senses, grabbed the longsword twisted into a pretzel beside him, and slammed it onto the ground.\n\"Damn it!!!\"\nThe atmosphere, which had been slightly heavy, lightened with Yu Huai's expletive.\nYu Jun turned his head: \"What did you just say!?\"\nYu Huai's body stiffened, and he slowly turned his head: \"N-nothing, Dad.\"\n\nYu Jun was already annoyed that his 'alt account' was gone, and now his 'main account' had an unknown side to him.\nAt this moment, thunder rumbled in the sky, heralding a coming storm.\nThe Yu Family Head rolled up his sleeves and stood up.\nBeating children on a rainy day, he might as well since he had nothing else to do.\nIf the 'alt account' was gone, then he would just fix the 'main account' properly; it could still be used!\n\nAfter the Yu family was the Luo family.\nThere was nothing much to say; the Luo family was relatively honest.\nBut when they went over, they heard people from the Luo family say that they still wouldn't fight Lu Ding, but they wanted to fight Bai Hemian.\nAt this, Bai Hemian's temper flared up again, and he immediately gave Luo Ping of the Luo family a reality check education.\n\nThe main points were:\nInjure skin, injure flesh, but not bone, making it painful and heartbreaking.\nSide kicks, flying kicks, but no hitting the head, only protecting the face.\nHorizontal inscription: Showing tender care for the fairer sex.\nLu Ding commented: \"You'd better be showing tender care for the fairer sex.\"\nFlying kicks were even involved...\n\nBai Hemian stated:\n\"She's not an enemy either. Grandma said girls cherish their faces and shouldn't get hurt, and boys should understand the distinction between genders and not touch a girl's this, this, and this.\"\nBai Hemian gestured sequentially at the upper, middle, and lower parts.\n\"So I didn't even use my hands.\"\nIf she were an enemy, Bai Hemian wouldn't bother with any of that.\n\nLu Ding: \"...\"\nYour thought process is something else.\nAll things considered, it would have been better to use your hands.\nWith one side kick, the person flew over ten meters, just \"whoosh,\" they were gone.\nFrom beginning to end, Lu Ding's hand remained over his mouth.\n\n\"Are we still going to the Qu family now?\"\nBai Hemian asked.\nLu Ding shook his head: \"The message hasn't arrived. Let's go back and cultivate first.\"\nNow, two of the top three families had been dealt with.\nThen there was the last one, Qu Ningyan.\nHowever, Lu Ding didn't plan to deal with her just yet.\nDirector Qiu's message hadn't arrived.\nLu Ding could use this time difference to go back, upgrade, and break through his cultivation realm.\nUsing the heavenly materials and earthly treasures provided by these families, he could manifest the Dragon-Locking Well.\nThen, once the message for action arrived,\nthe upgraded Lu Ding would be able to make Qu Ningyan and those demonic cultivators from the Heavenly Principle Sect, who always wanted to besiege him, all die in a pile together, saving the trouble of cleaning up extra battlefields and not wasting manpower, material resources, or financial resources.\n\n... ...\nArriving at Yunmeng 749.\nDeputy Director Qiu arranged a room for each of them.\nLu Ding sat cross-legged, looking at the six spoils of war before him.\nFive of them were from the Lan family, Zhai family, Ruan family, Yu family, and Luo family respectively. The sixth item was given by Director Qiu.\nIt was his reward for killing Ruan Kong.\nAs soon as the six high-quality heavenly materials and earthly treasures were laid out,\na mix of unusual fragrances immediately filled the room, invigorating anyone who smelled them.\nUnfortunately, such a good thing would only happen once.\nAt most, he could still 'pluck' one more from the Qu family.\nThen there was also one from the Golden Toad Holding Egg.\nBut it didn't matter; Lu Ding imagined that there would be many opportunities at the advanced training ground for him to acquire even better heavenly materials and earthly treasures.\n\nHe picked up the heavenly material and earthly treasure before him and ate it in large mouthfuls.\nThe medicinal effects began to spread and be absorbed.\nLu Ding formed a hand seal, activating the Cursed Dragon Bone Sigil.\nThe cursed dragon within his body once again began to gallop wildly through his meridians.\nThe 'unfinished building project' was finally about to restart!\nAs countless light particles in his spiritual sea began to ascend and converge into the sky, repairing his dilapidated Divine Palace,\nLu Ding's cultivation realm also began to climb upwards.\nHe once again made a hand seal.\nThe light particles began to orderly divide into two batches.\nOne batch upgraded and filled the Divine Palace.\nOne batch converged to construct the Dragon-Locking Well.\nLu Ding's hand seals were like construction blueprints.\nThis was similar to chanting in a magical world, a lot of gibberish, roughly meaning what longitude and latitude, how much attack power was needed, and what target to strike.\nHowever, Lu Ding's hand seals represented:\nHow large the Dragon-Locking Well should be built, whether it should be a classic model or a DIY custom design, and whether any unique symbols needed to be engraved.\n\"Hey, hey, hey, a little higher on the left, align the right side, level the wall, pay attention to the curve, your bricks are laid crooked!!\"\n\"Don't give me all that useless talk, rework! It must be reworked!!\"\n\"My eyes are rulers!!\"\n\nWhen his realm reached Divine Palace Triple Layer, the Dragon-Locking Well began to take shape. When his realm reached Divine Palace Quadruple Layer, the Dragon-Locking Well was already completed.\nThe exposed part was entirely black, with a vast space below, and two chains swung about.\nThe cursed dragon in his meridians, waiting for Lu Ding's command, directly rushed over.\nIt grabbed the chains and put them around its neck, a born beast of burden.\nAs the cursed dragon was suppressed into the Dragon-Locking Well,\nLu Ding's aura gradually receded, like a hidden dragon in the abyss. The quality of the spiritual energy within his body improved once again, and his combat power significantly increased.\n\nBut!\nA gradually receding aura represented low-key, but Lu Ding never did anything needlessly low-key.\nHe made a hand seal.\nBang!!!!\nA terrifying explosion immediately echoed from his spiritual sea.\nDark clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, and lightning flashed. The Stone Guardian in his spiritual sea appropriately 'released some water',\ncausing the spiritual sea to unleash monstrous waves that surged to the sky, creating the appearance of a great demon emerging.\nThe stage was set.\nBut the cursed dragon at the bottom of the well hadn't even settled down properly when, as the spiritual energy filled the Dragon-Locking Well and exploded, it was directly blasted out again.\nThe cursed dragon was forced to break out of the well.\nThe broken chains on its body clanked.\nThe cursed dragon was a bit bewildered: \"Didn't I just lie down!!\"\n\nLu Ding's aura and realm rose again with that recent explosion, and black smoke billowed in the room.\nAt this moment, his realm had already reached Divine Palace Quintuple Layer.\nA jump of three layers at once!!\nFrom Divine Palace Double Layer directly to Divine Palace Quintuple Layer!!!\nHis combat power surged twice.\nThe reason for ascending three realms was due to two surges in combat power. This was because the combat power boost from realm advancement itself\nwas gradual, a natural progression where one's level rose with the tide, not considered a 'surge'.\nThe boost from the Dragon-Locking Well suppressing the cursed dragon, and the cursed dragon breaking out of the well, these were the 'surges'.\nAt this moment, Lu Ding, having undergone two major updates and iterations, was already different from just a moment ago.\nOne couldn't even say 'from back then'; 'back then' was too long ago, it had to be 'just now'.\n\nDuring the day.\nAfter the commotion of last night,\nrumors spread throughout Yunmeng that all the talented youths of Yunmeng, below Qu Ningyan, had either voluntarily conceded or were sought out and beaten.\nNow, on the entire Yunmeng Talent List, only Qu Ningyan remained as a sole sapling, still standing at the top.\nThe second and third spots on the list below had been replaced by Lu Ding's and Bai Hemian's names.\n\nIn the afternoon.\nQu Ningyan, under immense pressure, arrived at a high-end hotel in Yunmeng.\nThe room door opened.\nA person sat before the floor-to-ceiling window, with a man and a woman standing behind him, turning to look.\nThese three were the main force of the Heavenly Principle Sect's visit to Yunmeng this time.\nOne of the Heavenly Principle Sect's Deputy Sect Masters, Past Limitless.\nAnd his subordinates, Body Pillar and Flower Pillar.\nSeeing this lineup, Qu Ningyan felt that it was stable. No matter how monstrous Lu Ding's abilities were, he couldn't escape the Heavenly Principle Sect's grasp.\nShe went over, bowed slightly, and greeted: \"Greetings, Deputy Sect Master.\"\nThe man nodded in response.\n\nQu Ningyan straightened up, filled with countless doubts, but she dared not ask the Deputy Sect Master. She could only walk to Flower Pillar, with whom she had a better relationship, and quietly asked:\n\"Why is the Deputy Sect Master here?\"\nFlower Pillar whispered: \"The Deputy Sect Master is very angry about Fire Pillar's death, and with Fire Pillar as a lesson, if it were just us, we might not be able to take down Lu Ding.\"\n\"His combat power cannot be calculated by conventional means.\"\n\"Even if several more Pillars came, there would only be a chance to subdue him, it would be difficult to kill him, and there's also the risk of being picked off one by one.\"\n\"So, for caution and assurance, the Deputy Sect Master happened to be free and decided to come personally, to crush all his possibilities from the root.\"\n\"Since you, Lu Ding, are cautious and bold yet meticulous, then we will be even more cautious than you.\"\n\"Aren't you in the Divine Palace realm?\"\nThe Heavenly Principle Sect directly dispatched a strong practitioner in the Earth Observation Realm, one comparable to Qiu Si, although precisely speaking, not as strong as Qiu Si.\nBut to deal with just one Divine Palace realm practitioner like you, that is more than enough.",

    "content": ".....\n\nAlthough that was the reasoning, Qu Ningyan felt it was a bit unreliable.\n\nAs for where exactly it was unreliable, she couldn't quite put her finger on it.\n\nIf Lu Ding could be killed so easily, then why hadn't those people before managed to kill him?\n\nShe turned her head and looked at the Deputy Cult Master of the Heavenly Principles Sect, who was sitting there.\n\nThat's true. In the past, no Earth Observation Realm practitioner had ever made a move against Lu Ding.\n\nAnd as far as she knew, there didn't seem to be any precedent for Lu Ding being surrounded, right?\n\nIt was always him leading the 749 to besiege others. This time, the tables have turned¹; it's your turn now.\n\nPast Infinite of the Heavenly Principles Sect happened to be in a good mood at the moment.\n\nHe turned his head to look.\n\nStaring at Qu Ningyan: \"You seemed very nervous just now? This shouldn't be our first meeting, should it?\"\n\nQu Ningyan quickly bowed and replied:\n\n\"Lu Ding is too powerful, and the external pressure is immense. I have no confidence against him. Furthermore, after this siege, I probably won't be able to stay in the Qu family, so that's why I'm quite nervous.\"\n\nAlthough Qu Ningyan had joined the Heavenly Principles Sect,\n\nShe was still a member of the Qu family.\n\nThis place had given birth to her and raised her; how could she not have feelings for it?\n\nOriginally, Qu Ningyan had been somewhat prepared mentally, but the day of departure had come too quickly.\n\nHer preparations weren't thorough enough.\n\nGoodbyes were always sad.\n\nBut she couldn't blame herself, nor could she blame the Qu family, and even less could she blame the Heavenly Principles Sect.\n\nSo the only person she could blame was Lu Ding.\n\nIf Lu Ding hadn't come to Yunmeng, she would absolutely not have had to prepare to leave the Qu family so quickly.\n\nTherefore, everything was Lu Ding's fault.\n\nOf course, she could also choose not to participate in besieging Lu Ding.\n\nBut relying solely on Body Pillar and Flower Pillar couldn't guarantee taking down Lu Ding; it wasn't safe enough.\n\nSo...\n\n\"You don't need to be too nervous. Many things are uncertain. Plans are nowhere near as fast as changes.\"\n\n\"If our plan succeeds this time, and Qiu Si doesn't react in time, you can still continue to stay in Yunmeng.\"\n\n\"If he reacts and stops me in time, I will hold him back. The three of you will deal with him, even if it means an early departure.\"\n\n\"Even in the worst-case scenario, you won't be harmed. Although my raw strength can't defeat Qiu Si, if I want to leave, he can't stop me.\"\n\nThese words were spoken lightly, yet sounded full of confidence.\n\nIt was unclear where this confidence came from.\n\nIn his words, he spoke of being unable to defeat others and needing to avoid their sharp edge in a way that sounded surprisingly refined.\n\nAlthough, upon hearing these words, it sounded seamless,\n\nHowever, there was still a small problem within it.\n\n\"Lu Ding also has Bai Hemian by his side.\"\n\nThey really weren't treating Xiao Bai as a person, not mentioning his existence at all.\n\nIn response,\n\nBody Pillar said with a hint of disdain: \"We've considered that, but Bai Hemian's lethality is not as great as Lu Ding's. We are not targeting him this time.\"\n\n\"Therefore, he will be held off by other ordinary members of the Heavenly Principles Sect. Even if it costs their lives, we brought over a hundred people this time; it'll be enough to give him a hard time.²\"\n\nYou can't have your cake and eat it too.³\n\nKilling one Lu Ding was already troublesome enough.\n\nBai Hemian, just let him live then. In Body Pillar's eyes, this was a boon.\n\n\"If, after killing Lu Ding, I still have a free hand, I'll give Bai Hemian a palm strike as well.\"\n\nThis sentence was added by Past Infinite.\n\nQu Ningyan nodded. If that was the case, she felt relieved.\n\n\"Then I'll go prepare. Issue a challenge to Lu Ding? As for the location, where do you think would be good for the meeting?\"\n\n\"Just Xiaolin Mountain outside the city. Our people will ambush within a ten-kilometer radius, forming a circle. As for the excuse, you can say it's to preserve the reputation of the Qu family and the talents of Yunmeng.\"\n\n\"Therefore, outsiders are not to know the outcome of this battle. As compensation, if Lu Ding wins, you can give him two rare treasures. If Lu Ding isn't at ease, he can bring investigators.\"\n\nThis excuse was acceptable. Although it would be a bit of a blow to one's reputation if exposed afterwards,\n\nBut it didn't matter. Qu Ningyan wouldn't be in Yunmeng anymore, so if her reputation here dropped, then so be it.\n\nBefore leaving, she had one last thing to say.\n\nIt was also a way to check for omissions and fill in the blanks.\n\n\"Deputy Cult Master, what do you think? Can I pretend not to know when you make your move, and lurk by his side?\"\n\n\"Then, when he lowers his guard, and is fighting with the two Nine Pillars, I can seize the opportunity to launch a sneak attack on him?\"\n\nPast Infinite gave her an admiring look: \"You may.\"\n\nQu Ningyan exited the room.\n\nAfter watching her leave, Body Pillar snorted coldly: \"Shameless!\"\n\n\"Hey, you can't say that. We'll all be colleagues later, sharing the same rice bowl.⁴\"\n\n\"Besides, what are we? We're an evil cult, as designated by the 749. Isn't it normal for an evil cult to carry out sneak attacks, play dirty tricks, and use schemes?\"\n\n\"Are evil cults supposed to fight fair and square head-on? If we really had that ability, then we'd be the '749'.\"\n\nThe words were crude, but the reasoning wasn't. But your words are *too* crude.\n\nBody Pillar heard it and found no fault, but the more he listened, the more awkward it felt.\n\n.....\n\nThat evening, the challenge arrived.\n\nOf course, it didn't reach Lu Ding's hands, but rather the 749's Operations Command Center.\n\nLu Ding was also seated there.\n\nHe looked at the sand table model laid out before them.\n\nQiu Si was speaking and deploying orders.\n\n\"Although we don't know what realm of Qi Refiners the Heavenly Principles Sect will send, but based on Lu Ding's last performance...\"\n\n\"I infer that the people from the Heavenly Principles Sect will absolutely not foolishly send one or two Nine Pillars over again.\"\n\n\"Given the situation within the Heavenly Principles Sect, the person initiating this siege on Lu Ding is Fire Pillar. He is a subordinate of Past Infinite of the Heavenly Principles Sect.\"\n\n\"Therefore, there's a high probability that Past Infinite will come in person.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Qiu Si extended a finger, sliding it across the sand table from a distance.\n\nHe circled a fifty-kilometer range on it.\n\n\"If it truly is Past Infinite of the Heavenly Principles Sect who comes, we will temporarily designate the combat zone as fifty kilometers.\"\n\n\"Within these fifty kilometers, we are uncertain how many people there will be. Therefore, I've decided to raise a Level 2 alert, and dispatch one thousand investigators.\"\n\n\"I will personally take the field to command the operation, and seal off this area.\"\n\nSince there were many unknowns in the intelligence,\n\nThey would then fully utilize their home-field advantage: overwhelm with numbers, overwhelm with combat power, overwhelm with equipment, overwhelm with firepower.\n\nReducing all bad possibilities to a minimum.\n\nEradicate evil thoroughly!\n\nAbsolutely no risky economizing.\n\nIt's just that this place couldn't use missiles or similar weapons, otherwise, they'd be in for a surprise.\n\nLu Ding listened to the arrangements of Deputy Director Qiu.\n\nHe silently thought to himself, \"One thousand investigators...\"\n\n\"So... can the Heavenly Principles Sect bring two hundred people?\"\n\n\"Even if they could bring two hundred, on average, five 749 investigators would be assigned to one Heavenly Principles Sect Qi Refiner.\"\n\n\"This is...\"\n\n\"Everyone would have to rely on sheer luck⁵. If luck was bad, let alone grabbing a kill, you wouldn't even see a single hair⁶.\"\n\n\"Solid, this is truly solid.\"\n\nAs expected of the home-field advantage.\n\nIf something could be overwhelmed by numbers and combat power, they would absolutely not engage in any 1v1 fights.\n\nSimply overwhelming.\n\nSomeone raised a doubt.\n\n\"Deputy Director, if Past Infinite of the Heavenly Principles Sect truly comes, it would be difficult for you to hold him by yourself, wouldn't it?\"\n\nQiu Si's face showed a mysterious smile, and he looked at Lu Ding with an inquiring gaze.\n\n\"Has the old gentleman left?\"\n\nLu Ding shook his head: \"Not so fast. He'll probably only go back once we're outside Yunmeng.\"\n___\n¹ **风水轮流转 (fēngshuǐ lúnliú zhuǎn)**: Literally \"Feng Shui takes turns.\" Idiomatic for \"the tables have turned\" or \"things are changing.\"\n² **够他喝一壶的 (gòu tā hē yī hú de)**: Literally \"enough for him to drink a pot.\" Idiomatic for \"enough to give someone a hard time\" or \"enough to keep someone busy/occupied.\"\n³ **鱼和熊掌不可兼得 (yú hé xióngzhǎng bùkě jiāndé)**: Literally \"One cannot have both fish and bear's paw.\" Idiomatic for \"you can't have your cake and eat it too\" or \"you can't have it all.\"\n⁴ **在一個鍋里吃飯 (zài yī ge guō lǐ chīfàn)**: Literally \"eating from the same pot.\" Idiomatic for \"sharing the same livelihood\" or \"working together for common benefits.\"\n⁵ **看臉看運氣 (kànliǎn kàn yùnqì)**: Literally \"look at face, look at luck.\" Implies relying entirely on good fortune, often used for games of chance or gacha.\n⁶ **毛你都看不到 (máo nǐ dōu kànbudào)**: Literally \"you wouldn't even see a hair of them.\" Idiomatic for \"you wouldn't see anything at all\" or \"you wouldn't get a chance.\"",

    "content": "With his words finished, he raised his hand, and a slash burst forth. Lu Ding used the recoil to fly backwards.\n\nTwo attacks slammed down onto the spot where he had originally been standing.\n\nThey whipped the already fragmented corpse of Qu Ningyan again.\n\nBody Pillar and Flower Pillar landed.\n\nThey looked at Lu Ding with serious expressions.\n\nThis person never plays by the rules; his appearance always makes plans unable to keep up with changes.\n\nBody Pillar, who had been half-crouching, stood up and stepped forward.\n\nHe tore off his shirt, revealing lean and powerful, but not bulky, muscles.\n\nHe twisted Qi with both hands, and a crisp clanging of copper rings could be heard as dozens of copper rings covered both of his forearms.\n\nThey were both weapons and armor.\n\n\"Iron Wire Fist?\"\n\nLu Ding paced a step or two: \"You are Tianli Cult's Body Pillar, Zhao Jian.\"\n\nSeeing his bland expression and voice that showed no emotional fluctuation.\n\nZhao Jian felt displeased: \"It's just missing a Qu Ningyan, and it's two against one, yet you're still so calm. I don't understand what you're being so arrogant about!?\"\n\nLu Ding raised his hand, displaying his fist, and there was a *crack*.\n\nIn an instant, he turned his head, refusing to look him straight in the eye, his expression revealing defiance: \"What am I arrogant about?\"\n\nAlthough Lu Ding didn't like talking nonsense, this question, he wanted to answer.\n\n\"Dominant in the district, rampant in the province, this year at the Three-District Martial Arts Drill, among tens of thousands of investigators, I'm number one. You tell me what I'm arrogant about?\"\n\nHearing this, Zhao Jian immediately felt self-humiliated. He shouldn't have asked; he just handed him a chance to show off.\n\nIn an instant, Zhao Jian raised his hand and smashed it out, the copper rings on his forearm clanging. The main thing was the element of surprise.\n\nBut initiating at zero frames has always been Lu Ding's signature skill.\n\nWielding a large saber in front of Guan Yu.^1\n\nHow could he not have guarded against such a move himself?\n\nHis counterattack struck first despite being initiated later; a punch landed squarely on Zhao Jian's side face, flesh and blood torn, abraded, and crushed by the force wrapped around the fist's peak, along with the bones of his cheekbones, which pulverized and fell off.\n\nIf one's vision could penetrate, they would be able to see.\n\nZhao Jian's brain, because of Lu Ding's heavy punch, shook and impacted his skull, already sustaining tissue damage.\n\nHis eyes immediately became dazed, and his body uncontrollably tilted and fell to the ground.\n\n'*He's so fast, so strong... Completely different from what I previously expected. How could he have become strong again...*'\n\n\"Flower... Pillar, run...\"\n\nAs Zhao Jian yelled this, a cold glint attacked from the darkness.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand in a 'flower-picking' gesture.\n\nHe saw a flying knife in his hand.\n\n*Hiss!!!!*\n\nPoisonous anesthetic gas bubbled out from the flying knife.\n\nFrom the ground where Zhao Jian was lying, a figure emerged, picked up his body, and ran.\n\nFlower Pillar's voice rang in Zhao Jian's ear: \"Run, of course I'm taking you with me.\"\n\n\"He... his physical body is stronger than mine... I...\"\n\n\"Don't worry, have you forgotten the medicine I tested on you last time?\"\n\nZhao Jian's mind wavered for a moment; he remembered that Flower Pillar had previously tested medicine on him.\n\nOnly a tiny bit could anesthetize him and make him fall to the ground.\n\nThen Flower Pillar continued: \"What I just used is dozens of times stronger than what anesthetized you last time. No matter how strong his physical body is, he will still be restricted. We can't win in a fight now, but if I want to run, he definitely...\"\n\nSpeaking of this.\n\nFlower Pillar suddenly stopped abruptly.\n\nThe pupils in his eyes shrank drastically.\n\nHe saw, next to a large tree ahead.\n\nLu Ding stood blocking the way, holding the flying knife in one hand and lifting a Tianli Cult member with the other.\n\nHe exhaled a long breath, carrying white mist.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nThe Tianli Cult member, who had still been somewhat conscious in his hand, tilted his head the instant he smelled the white mist.\n\nLu Ding then unleashed a slash with his hand.\n\nHe watched as this Tianli Cult member's flesh and blood disintegrated in his hand, his bones turning to dust.\n\n\"Anesthetic gas, and it's poisonous. What do you think it's good for?\"\n\nLu Ding's body was no longer something that could be affected by this kind of thing.\n\nFor him, this stuff was actually not much different from a regular cigarette.\n\nIt passed through his lungs, and he exhaled smoke.\n\nFlower Pillar instantly broke out in a cold sweat upon seeing this.\n\nThe current situation was almost explicitly stating that Lu Ding's physical quality was at least dozens of times greater than Body Pillar's!\n\nIt must be known that Body Pillar was known for his physical body, which is why he's called Body Pillar.\n\nBut Lu Ding's physical body could actually be so much stronger than his.\n\nFlower Pillar took a step back.\n\nHe tried to reason with Lu Ding: \"Lu Ding, let's talk, actually...\"\n\nThe next second.\n\nLu Ding's afterimage was still in place, but his true body had already arrived in front of him.\n\nHe raised his hand and brought a punch down onto his head.\n\n*Bang!!!!*\n\nA punch containing terrifying power directly smashed Flower Pillar's upper half into the ground as if driving a nail.\n\nImmediately after, another punch landed.\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nThis punch completely drove Flower Pillar's entire body into the ground, leaving only an indented, irregular head still exposed on the surface.\n\nAll signs of life disappeared.\n\nLu Ding kicked some sand to bury his head, creating a small mound on the ground.\n\nStanding in front of the mound.\n\nLu Ding spoke, replying to his previous words: \"Alright, we can talk now, speak.\"\n\nAfter saying this, he tilted his head, turning his ear to the mound, as if listening.\n\nZhao Jian, who had been thrown aside by Flower Pillar before he died, staggered to his feet.\n\nBlood from the wounds on his face stretched out, staining half of his body.\n\nSeeing that Flower Pillar was dead, he felt grief and indignation in his heart, and all sorts of memories of the two of them from the past surfaced in his mind!\n\nBody Pillar roared loudly: \"Lu Ding!!!\"\n\nAs he suddenly leapt up, his hands, like heavy hammers, smashed down.\n\nLu Ding tilted his body and dodged by a hair's breadth, fully displaying elegance.\n\nThe ground's soil rolled away, the immense force tearing open cracks in the earth and swallowing up all plants and trees within a hundred meters.\n\nZhao Jian tilted his head and saw dark red patterns clinging to Lu Ding's entire body.\n\nThere were halos encircling his pupils.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to stand at the peak of a high mountain, able to touch the sky with a mere reach.\n\nIn those clouds, horror was hidden.\n\nFerocious dragon claws tore through the darkness.\n\nIn an instant, they pressed down on Zhao Jian's head.\n\nBlack energy swirled around Lu Ding's body, his eyes emitting a strange dark red light.\n\n\"You also have friendship and bonds?\"\n\nHis hand gripped Zhao Jian's head tightly and lifted him.\n\nPain surged; he forced himself not to cry out, gritting his teeth and saying, word by word: \"Lu Ding! You! Won't! Die! Well!\"\n\nAs his words fell.\n\nLu Ding's slash burst forth.\n\nA moment later, Zhao Jian in his hand was left with only a head.\n\nLu Ding thought for a moment and smiled contemptuously.\n\n\"Anyway, you died before me. Whether I die well or not, you won't see it.\"\n\nHe tightened his grip.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nLu Ding flicked the blood from his palm and kicked the fragments on the ground further away.\n\nEven in death, he wouldn't let the two of them die next to each other.\n\nHe flashed and disappeared from the spot.\n\nIn the forest, over a thousand Yunmeng 749 investigators were besieging over a hundred Tianli Cult members.\n\nBeating them so they had no power to fight back.\n\nThis was almost a one-sided slaughter, the kind where even the kill count slots had to be snatched.\n\nGuoqu Wuji, seeing this scene, felt an indescribable feeling in his heart.\n\nDragging his injured body, he turned his head to glance at Chou Si, whose hands were stained with blood.\n\nThen he glanced towards Lu Ding, who was perfectly unharmed on a treetop on the other side.\n\nHe sighed softly in his heart.\n\nThe fact that Lu Ding could appear here meant that Body Pillar and Flower Pillar were either dead or had escaped.\n\nNo matter the outcome, he could not stay in this place much longer.\n\n\"Lu Ding, I admit I still underestimated you, but the days ahead are still long. Today if I want to leave, you can't stop me. Later, we will meet again.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he saw Lu Ding's face full of mocking smiles, and added: \"What are you laughing at?\"\n\n---\n^1. Literally \"wielding a large saber in front of Guan Yu.\" This Chinese idiom means to display one's skill or talent before an expert in that field, implying a foolish or arrogant act of showing off in front of someone vastly superior.",

    "content": "「I laugh at you, on the verge of death, still posturing.」\n\nHearing Lu Ding's words, Guoqu Wuji's smile became even harder to suppress.\n\n「Hahahahahahaha... Good, good, good... Good, 'on the verge of death'? A fine 'on the verge of death,' based on what? Based on your Divine Palace Realm cultivation?」\n\n「Undeniab—」\n\nGuoqu Wuji's words stopped abruptly.\n\nAn elder with a heavy voice said from behind him: 「It's undeniable that your movement technique indeed has its unique aspects, but if you wish to escape in front of me, you are welcome to try; I will give you the chance.」\n\nAs he spoke.\n\nElder Deng, who had appeared behind Guoqu Wuji at some unknown point.\n\nRaised his hand, making the motion of drawing a bow and nocking an arrow.\n\nSpiritual energy circulated in his hand, condensing a large bow. Nocking an arrow with an empty hand, as the large bow reached full draw, a golden arrow emanated light.\n\nKilling intent locked on.\n\nCold sweat dripped from Guoqu Wuji's forehead, falling straight down to the ground dozens of meters below.\n\nHorrified in his heart, Heaven... Heavenly Watch Realm!!!\n\nPanic-stricken, he didn't even dare to turn his head to look behind him.\n\nElder Deng spoke: 「Get ready...」\n\nThat single bead of sweat was still falling until it hit the ground, shattering and splashing.\n\n「Run.」\n\nA fierce wind struck, and Guoqu Wuji shot out abruptly. Behind him, streaks of afterimages continuously appeared and disappeared, reaching all the way to the horizon.\n\nA momentary auditory hallucination in his ear.\n\nA crisp sound of a bowstring being released. Guoqu Wuji, like a startled bird*, inexplicably twisted his body to dodge.\n\nThe result was that the golden arrow struck him squarely in the chest, pierced through his body, and transformed into a wisp of gold in the black curtain of the sky, disappearing into the distance.\n\nThe figure in the air tilted and fell, spiraling down from high altitude until it slammed heavily onto the ground.\n\nThud!!!\n\nWho would have thought that this corpse, lying among the scattered rocks, would actually be the Vice-Sect Master of the Tianli Sect?\n\nHis eyes wide open, he died with his eyes unclosed.\n\nLu Ding flew over and stood suspended in the air, merely inches above the ground.\n\nHe responded to Guoqu Wuji, who had previously mentioned by name that they would meet again.\n\n「We certainly did meet again, only there's a separation of life and death between us. You... were half right.」\n\nQiu Si came over and lifted Guoqu Wuji's corpse.\n\n「One of the Three Extremes, Guoqu Wuji. No matter how arrogant you were, how boundless your past glory, now you're just a dead dog. What was the point?」\n\nBowing to Elder Deng in the sky, Qiu Si thanked him: 「Many thanks for your assistance, Elder Deng.」\n\n「No need to be so polite.」\n\nHaving said that, Elder Deng became invisible and disappeared.\n\nQiu Si then looked at Lu Ding: 「Lu Ding, this Guoqu Wuji is one of the Tianli Sect's Three Extremes. This matter today is no small thing.」\n\n「The follow-up reports and regulations will take a little time. Why not stay and enjoy Yunmeng for a bit? Once the reports go up and are approved, you'll be allocated contribution points.」\n\nFearing Lu Ding wouldn't agree, Qiu Si added: 「Just a few days.」\n\nNormally, Lu Ding might have agreed.\n\nAfter all, a few days' time was nothing.\n\nBut not now. The Golden Toad Holding Egg Scheme** was not something only he was thinking about.\n\nAnd Li Daqiezi, the treasure hunter***, was also thinking about it.\n\nIf, because of these two days of rest, Li Daqiezi went ahead and 'dug out the egg,' Lu Ding's loss would be considerable.\n\nAlthough it was said, 'Ah, wait until Chang Haier harvests the corn before making a move.'\n\nBut who knows the real situation behind that?\n\nYou can't fully trust other people's words!\n\nLu Ding refused: 「Forget it, Director Qiu. I'll come again next time. This time, I still need to go to the next place.」\n\nQiu Si looked at Lu Ding.\n\nSigh, what an excellent new-generation investigator! He had only heard about him before, but today he truly understood.\n\nHe doesn't even rest.\n\nHow could he not feel inadequate?\n\nHe's practically a model worker among new-generation investigators.\n\nSuch a person should be praised vigorously!\n\nToo bad he isn't a Yunmeng investigator.\n\n「So you're planning to leave right now?」\n\nLu Ding smiled: 「No need to rush that much; leaving tomorrow morning is fine too.」\n\n「Alright then. I heard you like hotpot. Come on, I'll treat you to a hotpot meal.」\n\nLu Ding went back and picked up Bai Hemian.\n\nHe glanced at the unconscious girl.\n\nLu Ding wasn't interested in her fate, but he guessed she'd probably end up with labor reform.\n\nDuring the battlefield cleanup.\n\nMany investigators who hadn't 'snatched a kill'**** were sighing one after another, their backs slumped.\n\nThey didn't even get the contribution points that were practically given away for free.\n\nWhat a tragedy!!!\n\nAlthough there was a guaranteed minimum for this mission, killing or capturing Tianli Sect 'demons'***** still earned extra contribution points.\n\nFreebies!\n\nDead legs!! Why did they run so slow!!\n\nOn the way back to Yunmeng 749.\n\nThis time, Lu Ding did not choose to fly as he usually did.\n\nInstead, he took a car.\n\nSeeing that the time wasn't too late.\n\nLu Ding took out his phone, scrolled through his contacts, and found 'Counselor (You Jianyu)'.\n\nHe tapped to dial.\n\nAfter a few beeps, the sound of keys clattering came from the other side, accompanied by other noisy sounds.\n\nIt sounded like he was in an internet cafe.\n\n「Hey, Lu Ding, what's up?」\n\nLu Ding's voice carried a smile: 「Brother Yu is playing 'chicken'****** at the internet cafe again? I'm afraid not many people play this game anymore, right?」\n\n「Who says not, indeed? I haven't seen many people playing 'chicken' in the entire internet cafe. Is there something you called me for?」\n\n「It's like this, Brother Yu, I'm not planning to come back. Just wanted to let you know.」\n\n「What!!!?」\n\n「No, wait a minute, Lu Ding, I'll go out to the stairwell to talk to you; the internet cafe is a bit noisy!」\n\nLu Ding waited.\n\nHe recalled in his heart all the times this counselor had helped him in the past.\n\nVarious subsidies, opportunities—the man had never once let him miss out.\n\nHe truly was a very good person.\n\nIf any classmates came to him with an issue, as long as it could be handled, he would absolutely not drag his feet.\n\nTo summarize, he was handsome, talkative, humorous, had high emotional intelligence, was a non-marriage advocate*******, but just had a bit of a fiery temper.\n\nBefore, he even went out and fought with a fruit vendor because a female classmate from his class was ripped off buying fruit at the school gate.\n\nHe almost got stabbed in the stomach by a knife that was reluctant to be sheathed********.\n\nTherefore, Lu Ding felt that if he wasn't going back, he had to tell him, so as not to put him in a difficult position.\n\nThe noise on the other end of the phone gradually quieted down.\n\nIt seemed You Jianyu had reached the stairwell.\n\nHe heard him say: 「Hello, Lu Ding, can you hear me?」\n\n「I can hear you.」\n\n「Why aren't you suddenly coming back to school? Is there some difficulty? If there's a difficulty, just say it.」\n\n「If you're short on tuition fees, I can lend them to you first, but you'll have to write me an IOU and pay me back when you have money.」\n\n「Then, after school starts, I'll go find you some financial aid. No problem should hinder your studies.」\n\n「Our university is genuinely not bad; getting a diploma is good for appearances too.」\n\nLu Ding quietly listened to his rambling before responding: 「I've found a very good job now, working for the country; it's considered having an 'iron rice bowl'*********, so I won't be returning. There are truly no other difficulties.」\n\n「Got an 'iron rice bowl'? Hahahaha, well, you're really a step ahead of your peers!」\n\nAt this point, You Jianyu laughed: 「Lu Ding, you're not pulling my leg, are you?」\n\n---\n*   Like a startled bird (驚弓之鳥): An idiom describing someone who is extremely nervous or easily alarmed, often due to a past traumatic experience.\n**  Golden Toad Holding Egg Scheme (金蟾抱蛋局): Likely refers to a specific, high-value treasure or opportunity.\n*** Treasure hunter (憋宝人): A specialized profession or role focused on seeking out and acquiring rare treasures or artifacts.\n**** Snatched a kill (抢到人头): Slang, similar to \"kill stealing\" in video games, referring to taking the final blow or credit for eliminating an enemy.\n***** Demons (妖人): A derogatory term, often implying evil or unorthodox practitioners.\n****** Playing 'chicken' (吃鸡): Refers to playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), derived from the game's \"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner\" phrase.\n******* Non-marriage advocate (不婚族): Someone who chooses not to marry or believes in not marrying.\n******** A knife that was reluctant to be sheathed (羞刀難入鞘): An idiom suggesting that once a knife is drawn for conflict, it is difficult to put it away without further trouble or injury occurring.

    "content": "「Am I the one who makes boastful claims?」\n\nLu Ding retorted.\n\nThe other side laughed even harder.\n\n「Well... Lu Ding, can you get a certificate back? Don't misunderstand.」\n\n「It's not for any other reason, mainly because you've got an iron rice bowl* before you're even twenty, you must be a special talent.」\n\n「When the time comes, you get a certificate back, I'll make a copy, and my credentials will look good too.......」\n\nAfter all, Lu Ding was in his class, whether it was for bragging rights or real substance.\n\nThis would be greatly beneficial for You Jianyu's future development.\n\nLu Ding:「Oh, I thought you didn't believe me?」\n\nYou Jianyu:「So, are you going to come back and flaunt and humble others†?」\n\nSaying this, both laughed together.\n\nJust because he offered earlier to lend money if there were difficulties, plus their old friendship.\n\nThis favor.\n\nLu Ding had to help!\n\nThat's just how the world is; within permissible limits, you help me, I help you, it's normal.\n\nIf Lu Ding was doing well, he naturally had to bring along those who had helped him.\n\n「Alright, then in a while, I'll get a certificate and go back. Don't be surprised then, I guarantee it'll add bricks and tiles to your credentials and amaze everyone at school.」\n\n「Hahahahahaha, I'm already enjoying this pie you're drawing for me‡.」\n\n「Alright, alright, that's it for now. You keep having fun, I'm hanging up.」\n\n「Okay, bye for now. Take care of yourself.」\n\n「You too.」\n\nHanging up the phone, You Jianyu pulled out a cigarette and lit it:「Iron rice bowl... nineteen years old... sounds pretty impressive. My resume needs some gilding.」\n\nOn this side.\n\nAfter Lu Ding put away his phone, he wondered to himself what kind of certificate he should bring back then.\n\nDirector Qiu, who was driving, pushed the gear stick, watching the speed on the dashboard climb to two hundred.\n\nHe casually said,「Don't do things like 'wearing embroidered clothes at night'§. You're only young once; if you don't show off, you'll get old.」\n\n「It's just that I didn't have this opportunity when I was young.」\n\nHearing him say this, Lu Ding's eyes lit up; there was quite a bit of information in that remark.\n\nNot having this opportunity, and having regrets, didn't that mean Director Qiu had also imagined similar scenes in his heart?\n\nWhat he had just thought of on a whim, how could it compare to what someone else had been thinking about all along?\n\nJust take it and use it.\n\nHow great!\n\n「Director Qiu, can you offer some suggestions?」\n\nQiu Si was waiting for exactly this remark from Lu Ding.\n\nWith a turn of the steering wheel, he overtook another car.\n\n「Listen to me, you should have some junior brothers in Yunhai, right?」\n\n「Of course.」\n\n「Here's what you do: when you go back to Yunhai, have your junior brothers put on State Security uniforms, and drive the standard-issue cars the bureau phased out because they were too high-profile.」\n\n「Head straight to your school.」\n\n「Preferably at noon on the day with the most classes, arrive before dismissal, and then find the junior brother you just called.」\n\n「At that time, classes will have just ended, there will still be many people, you take out the State Security seal and stamp it – isn't that showing off perfectly?」\n\n「Bringing out a nineteen-year-old from State Security, your junior brother's resume won't just be gilded, it'll be turned into real gold! And looking at this spectacle, wow, you're even a leader, that's even more incredible!」\n\n「Hahahahahahahaha.......」\n\nQiu Si roared with laughter, and Lu Ding couldn't quite suppress the corners of his mouth either.\n\nPerfect!\n\nThat's how we'll do it!\n\nThere's just one problem.\n\n「Won't this violate regulations?」\n\n「Violate regulations? Violate what regulations? You're showing State Security, not 749. Besides, State Security doesn't expose itself to hide identities, but you're not an ordinary person.」\n\n「You don't need to carry out State Security missions, you're not afraid of exposure at all.」\n\n「If any criminals among ordinary people want to come after you, wouldn't that be even better? It's just a matter of convenience.」\n\n「Furthermore, it definitely wouldn't work for others, but you're different. You're the apple of Yunhai 749's eye**.」\n\n「For something that's not a mistake, no one can fault you.」\n\nThat really sounded right.\n\nWhen he thought about it, Lu Ding was indeed a non-stick pan††.\n\nOn this side, they chatted happily in the car.\n\nSoon, they arrived at the eating place.\n\nBut on the other side, the Qu family was not so happy.\n\nAs soon as the aftermath department personnel left.\n\nThe Qu family felt as if the sky had fallen.\n\nThe Qu family head was even a bit unsteady on his feet.\n\nHis excellent daughter had secretly colluded with the Heavenly Principle Cult, intending to ambush and kill 749 investigator Lu Ding, and was executed on the spot.\n\nHearing this news, even though he was an Earth Insight Realm Qi Refiner, he felt his vision go dark.\n\nThe bitterness in his heart was unspeakable.\n\nBecause for this matter, he couldn't blame anyone else; he could only blame Qu Ningyan for going astray, and blame himself for not watching over his daughter properly.\n\nBut Qu Ningyan was now gone.\n\nThe deceased are paramount‡‡.\n\nIn the end, the only one the Qu family head could blame was himself.\n\nSomeone who didn't understand reason couldn't sit in the position of family head.\n\nWith faltering steps, the Qu family head walked into the ancestral hall and did not emerge all night.\n\nWith the post-battle news released, and the Heavenly Principle Cult's Wuji brought to justice.\n\nThe interior of 749 was also abuzz.\n\nThe Level 2 alert wasn't a full deployment, and there were also confidentiality regulations, so the investigators who hadn't been on missions before...\n\n...when they saw this news.\n\nOne by one, they lamented their bad luck, that such an opportunity to easily gain contribution points didn't fall to them.\n\n「Such a good thing as easy contribution points didn't even fall to me, so annoying!!!」\n\n「Heh, what's the big deal? It's just a few contribution points, it's fine. I only got a dozen or so... huh, wait, why do I have over twenty?」\n\n「I have over thirty too, why is that?」\n\n「Oh~ I remember, it's probably because we killed the Heavenly Principle Cult demons, hahahahahaha!」\n\n「Damn it, scram, scram! You're all shameless.」\n\n「Alright, alright, I won't tease you anymore. I'll send you a contribution point red envelope later.」\n\n「Really, godfather!!?」\n\n「Hahahahahaha, but seriously, this Qu Ningyan really had guts, to actually try to ambush Lu Ding.」\n\n「What's the use of having guts if you don't have much ability? All day long, she was scheming, and then Lu Ding directly chopped her into fine dust that even a vacuum cleaner couldn't pick up.」\n\nJust then, someone passing by heard this.\n\nHe instantly stopped and emerged from the darkness.\n\nHe asked in an uncertain tone,「You just said, who was chopped into fine dust by Lu Ding?」\n\nThe few people speaking looked over.\n\nTheir expressions instantly turned serious, and they found it impossible to utter a word.\n\nBecause once it was said, it could cause trouble.\n\nThe speaker was named Chen An, the second-place winner of the previous Yunmeng 749 Martial Arts Tournament.\n\nHe was also one of Yunmeng's prominent figures.\n\nHe and Qu Ningyan once had a past that was known to everyone in Yunmeng.\n\nSimply put, they were high school classmates and attended the same high school.\n\nQu Ningyan, apart from secretly colluding with Heavenly Principle Cult demons, was actually decent as a person in her daily life.\n\nPlus, she was good-looking, and secretly a Qi Refiner, so in terms of demeanor, she was naturally superior to ordinary people.\n\nAt school, she was the type who stood out from the crowd§§, with many admirers.\n\nChen An was barely one of them, but he knew his place, understanding that he and Qu Ningyan were not on the same path, so he didn't harbor any delusions.\n\nLater, there was a class outing.\n\nPeople from the Heavenly Principle Cult took the opportunity to ambush Qu Ningyan.\n\n---\n*   An \"iron rice bowl\" is a Chinese idiom for a secure, usually government-guaranteed, job that provides stable income and benefits.\n†   \"Flaunt and humble others\" (装逼打脸) is a colloquial expression meaning to show off or act boastful in a way that proves others wrong or puts them in their place.\n‡   \"This pie you're drawing for me, I'm already enjoying it\" (你给我画的这饼，我可先吃上了啊) refers to \"drawing a pie\" (画饼), an idiom for making a grand but possibly empty promise or an unrealistic plan.

    "content": "......\n\nIt was also during this process that Chen An unintentionally awakened and became a Qi Refiner.\n\nAfter fleeing with Qu Ningyan for a day and a night, their relationship quickly warmed up.\n\nOriginally, Qu Ningyan and Chen An were not on the same path.\n\nBut as Chen An became a Qi Refiner, the gap between them narrowed.\n\nHis relationship with Qu Ningyan also evolved from mere classmates to friends.\n\nLater, Chen An joined 749, and the Qu family sent heavenly materials and earthly treasures to thank Chen An for his help and care during their escape with Qu Ningyan.\n\nIt was also thanks to these heavenly materials and earthly treasures that Chen An surpassed most newly joined Awakened ones in the initial stages.\n\nFurthermore, his own talent was excellent.\n\nGaining strength with each step, the snowball grew larger and larger. Other events occurred in between that won't be detailed, until he ultimately secured second place in last year's Yunmeng Martial Arts Tournament.\n\nHe then proceeded to a facility for advanced training.\n\nThe reason their story was known to everyone in Yunmeng was because, when Chen An achieved second place in the tournament, he publicly confessed his feelings on the arena stage to Qu Ningyan, who was present with her father to observe the ceremony.\n\nThen... he was tactfully rejected, in a way that preserved his dignity, but everyone understood.\n\nWhat happened between them later, outsiders had no way of knowing.\n\nIn any case, since then, few Qi Refiners in Yunmeng were unaware that Chen An liked Qu Ningyan.\n\nTo outsiders, it was normal for such a favored daughter of Heaven to be admired.\n\nBut Chen An felt it wasn't normal.\n\nHis relationship with Qu Ningyan had always been very good; they had been through so much together. Why did she reject him back then?\n\nHe had never received an answer to this question before, nor could he figure it out.\n\nHe had asked Qu Ningyan multiple times, intentionally or unintentionally, but never received a real answer.\n\nUntil now, he seemed to have understood something, but dared not believe it.\n\nThose 749 colleagues began speaking to him.\n\n“Chen An, you... don’t think too much about it. She... was secretly colluding with the Tianli Sect. Let it go.”\n\nSomeone advised, trying to dissuade him.\n\nChen An took a step back, unable to believe it in his heart.\n\nHis Adam’s apple bobbed. “So she... died?”\n\nThe others nodded helplessly, saying nothing more.\n\nChen An frantically pulled out his phone from his bag, opening the 749 app to check for detailed information.\n\nAfter a long while, he let out a bitter smile.\n\nHe understood. Chen An understood everything. He understood why Qu Ningyan had rejected him.\n\nIf 749 and the scions of Qi Refiner families were merely not quite compatible, but not explicitly forbidden from being together...\n\n...then 749 investigators and cult members were natural mortal enemies, like fire and water!\n\nUnder such circumstances, how could they possibly be together?\n\nThough the truth was laid bare before him, Chen An still refused to believe it in his heart.\n\n“Why... why would you secretly collude with the Tianli Sect? Didn’t they ambush you before? Didn’t we flee from their pursuit together for a day and a night... Why...”\n\nChen An’s eyes reddened. He slowly raised his head. “Do you know where Lu Ding is?”\n\n“Chen An, don’t do anything foolish. What Lu Ding did was all within regulations. Don’t provoke him.”\n\n“Do you know where Lu Ding is?”\n\nChen An repeated the question again.\n\nSeveral colleagues, also 749 investigators from Yunmeng, shook their heads and sighed.\n\nChen An didn’t ask further. He simply turned and left, pulling out his phone and scrolling through something incessantly.\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nLu Ding, Bai Hemian, and Qiu Si were having hotpot.\n\nAmidst the sizzling heat, another gulp of iced beer.\n\n“Ha~~~~”\n\nFeeling good.\n\nBut as they ate, Qiu Si pulled out his phone, and after reading something, his expression gradually turned serious.\n\nIt turned out that Chen An had used his senior investigator privileges to access Yunmeng’s Sky Eye surveillance equipment.\n\nHe had found the video of Qiu Si driving.\n\nAnd also saw Lu Ding in the passenger seat.\n\nChen An was now on his way.\n\nQiu Si downed the beer in his glass in one gulp, the glass thudding onto the table.\n\nAfter Lu Ding put a large piece of meat into his mouth, he looked up.\n\nAfter two chews and swallowing, he refilled his own glass and Qiu Si’s.\n\nThey clinked glasses and drank.\n\nHe asked, “Director Qiu, what’s wrong?”\n\nQiu Si took out cigarettes and offered them around, putting one in his own mouth. He lit it, took one drag that finished half the cigarette, and exhaled a thick cloud of smoke.\n\n“Lu Ding,” he said, “do you think what you did today was wrong?”\n\n“I don’t think I did anything wrong.”\n\n“Exactly, I don’t think you did anything wrong either. She wanted your life. What are you? You’re a 749 investigator. Wanting your life is a provocation to 749.”\n\n“What is the Tianli Sect? The Tianli Sect is a cult.”\n\n“She wanted your life, so you took hers. That’s normal.”\n\n“The Tianli Sect provokes 749, and 749 kills them. That’s also normal.”\n\n“I don’t understand why Chen An just can’t grasp this.”\n\nQiu Si’s tone gradually grew agitated.\n\nHearing that name, Lu Ding recalled the information about Qu Ningyan.\n\n“Yunmeng 749’s last Martial Arts Tournament second place winner?”\n\nQiu Si nodded. “Yes, that’s him. He’s on his way now.”\n\nLu Ding found it amusing. “Didn’t Qu Ningyan reject him?”\n\n“I’d like to know too. Qu Ningyan already rejected him, so why is he coming now? To question you, or to question me?”\n\n“To question why you killed Qu Ningyan, or to question why I allowed you to kill Qu Ningyan?”\n\nQiu Si sighed helplessly. There’s no harm without comparison.*\n\nLooking at Lu Ding, then at his own investigators... Ugh, too lazy to scold.\n\nListening to Qiu Si’s tone, it was mostly laden with disappointment that iron cannot be made into steel.*\n\nLu Ding leaned back against his chair. “So, Director Qiu, what do you want me to do?”\n\nQiu Si was tired. He waved his hand dismissively. “Do whatever you want. Just don’t kill him. Even if he’s left with only one breath, it’s fine. Let him get a good wake-up call.”\n\n“Since he’s able to come, he must bear the consequences himself. I know your temper and personality.”\n\n“I’m just his superior, not his father. In external situations, I’ll protect him; that’s my duty.”\n\n“But in a matter like this, if I still protect him, then I’d be even more muddle-headed than he is.”\n\nAs they were speaking, Chen An arrived.\n\nHe pushed open the door and burst into the private room.\n\nSeeing the three people inside, his gaze first fell on Qiu Si, who responded with a cold snort.\n\nThen he looked at Lu Ding.\n\nChen An restrained his emotions and asked, “Lu Ding, can I see your body camera footage?”\n\nCRASH!!!\n\nQiu Si smashed his glass directly onto the table.\n\n“Why should he show you?! You need to understand that Lu Ding isn’t from our district. According to regulations, even I can’t casually look at his body camera footage.”\n\n“If I want to see it, I have to follow proper procedure!”\n\nChen An lowered his head, clenching his fists. “I just want to know why she absolutely had to be executed on the spot.”\n\n“She was once ambushed by the Tianli Sect. Maybe she had some hidden hardship. Couldn’t she have been captured and interrogated first? Why did she absolutely have to...”\n\n“749 Investigator Emergency Self-Preservation Regulations, haven’t you learned them? Have you or have you not? Answer me!!!”\n\nChen An: “Yes.”\n\n“Under permissible emergency self-preservation conditions, if there is no mandatory requirement, 749 investigators have the right to independently judge the life or death of a target based on their own safety.”\n\nQiu Si chuckled. “I thought you’d forgotten. Since you’ve already recited it yourself, now, immediately, turn around, leave here, and go write me a two-thousand-word self-criticism report.”\n\nChen An didn’t move. Qiu Si shook his head and said nothing more.\n\nLu Ding understood that Qiu Si’s good advice was exhausted; it was his turn to make an appearance.\n\nHe stood up. “What you’re saying is merely based on your relationship with her, using my safety to enforce your standards, not 749’s standards.”\n\n“I just...”\n\nChen An opened his mouth to say something more, but Lu Ding raised a hand to interrupt him.\n\n“I don’t want to hear your quibbling.”\n\nAs he spoke, Lu Ding lit a cigarette, took only one puff, and handed it back to Bai Hemian to hold.\n\n“Before the cigarette burns out, if you’re still standing... never mind, that might be pushing it for you.”\n\nLu Ding rephrased: “If you can still move before the cigarette burns out, I’ll show it to you.”\n___\n**Footnotes:**\n*   “There’s no harm without comparison” (没有对比就没有伤害): An idiom meaning one realizes how bad something is only when comparing it to something better.

    "content": "......\n\nWhen Bai Hemian took the cigarette.\n\nChen An looked at Chou Si, who didn't even acknowledge him.\n\nChen An, having received no reply.\n\nIn front of Lu Ding, he channeled qi through his body and asked in return: \"Can I fight back?\"\n\nHearing this, Bai Hemian pulled a smile onto his face, picked up the cigarette, and tried to take a puff.\n\nPfft!\n\nIt burned his throat.\n\nThen a muffled thud was heard.\n\nBang!!!!\n\nChen An's chest caved in, and he flew out, smashing through the wall and falling into the corridor.\n\nWith one front push kick, the wall shattered, his self-esteem shattered, and his sternum shattered too.\n\nLarge gouts of blood gushed out.\n\nLu Ding stepped out of the hole.\n\nHe grabbed Chen An's ankle and violently slammed him back into the private room through the hole in the wall.\n\nThe hole was already sizable.\n\nWith that smash, Chen An once again enlarged the hole in the wall with his head.\n\nHis entire body lay face down on the ground.\n\nThud!!!\n\nThe ground was covered in cracks, and the floor tiles shattered into fragments.\n\nBlood spewed from Chen An's mouth, painting the grayish-white concrete floor beneath the tiles a vibrant red.\n\nLu Ding squatted down. He raised a hand to the side, and Bai Hemian handed him the cigarette, tucking it between his fingers.\n\nThen he brought his hand back.\n\nThe hard concrete floor was thus deeply impaled by the soft cigarette butt.\n\nChen An, eyes glazed over, stared at the cigarette, which had only just formed a small segment of ash.\n\nIt was only slightly askew, not yet at the point where it would easily fall off.\n\nHe heard Lu Ding say: \"Do you know why she doesn't like you?\"\n\nChen An now had an unknown number of broken bones throughout his body; only his eyeballs could still move.\n\nLu Ding explained to him: \"Because your brain is too stupid, you talk too much nonsense, you lack a sense of propriety, you don't understand dignity, you don't know your own capabilities, and you can't gauge the current situation.\"\n\nChou Si got up and came over.\n\n\"Do you understand?\"\n\nChen An's dazed eyes were enough to explain everything.\n\nChou Si pointed at him: \"Someone hits you, and you still ask if you can hit back—that's stupid!!\"\n\n\"Stupid and full of useless talk!!\"\n\n\"Who the hell stands there and takes a beating without fighting back?!\"\n\n\"You are a Yunmeng 749 investigator, and her situation—the notice from above stated she was secretly colluding with the Tianli Sect. This battle was to be personally participated in and commanded by me.\"\n\n\"And you weren't even called.\"\n\n\"By this point, you should have understood. You're wearing Yunmeng 749's uniform, yet now you've run over here to question your colleague for the sake of a Tianli Sect member—this is lacking a sense of propriety!\"\n\n\"Back then, when you confessed to her, she said, 'We're just friends; we'll see about the future later.'\"\n\n\"That was her saving your dignity. When she didn't say she liked you, that meant she goddamn didn't like you.\"\n\n\"That day was also your most glorious day. In front of so many people, she didn't want to embarrass you, didn't want to put you in an awkward position!!\"\n\n\"It was also out of consideration for Yunmeng 749's reputation. You don't understand—that's stupidity compounded by stupidity!!\"\n\n\"I don't believe you don't know about Lu Ding's immense reputation recently, especially after he killed Ruan Kong yesterday.\"\n\n\"Since you knew, you should have properly compared whether you could handle Ruan Kong before coming to find him—that's not knowing your own capabilities!\"\n\n\"I'm goddamn sitting right here, telling you to go back and write a self-criticism report, which was meant to be your last chance. Yet you stubbornly couldn't hear or see it.\"\n\n\"This is being unable to gauge the current situation!!\"\n\nAs Chou Si spoke these words, his chest heaved, and his face was flushed.\n\nHe looked as if he were about to die from anger.\n\nHe stood with hands on hips, pacing, then reached out again, pointing at Chen An on the ground.\n\nHe slapped his own face.\n\nTo the sound of smacking.\n\nWith a tone of deep disappointment that iron cannot be forged into steel, he said: \"Yunmeng 749's face is about to be completely shamed by you!!!\"\nFootnote 1: \"To lament that iron cannot become steel,\" an idiom meaning to feel deep disappointment in someone who has not lived up to expectations.\n\n\"Just now I told you to leave, but you didn't. Now you don't need to wait to go back; I'll approve your punishment immediately!\"\n\n\"Yunmeng 749 Senior Investigator Chen An.\"\n\n\"For violating Yunmeng 749 internal management regulations, he is hereby sentenced to deprivation of Senior Investigator status, demotion to Intern Investigator, cancellation of all welfare benefits, and a one-year confinement!!\"\n\n\"And!! Goddamn it, the compensation for this place will be deducted from your share!!\"\n\nWhether it was about status or not, this punishment wasn't actually that severe.\n\nWhat was severe was the final confinement.\n\nTo give a real-life example of this.\n\nBai Hemian.\n\nJust take Bai Hemian.\n\nSuch a ruthless person, after being confined for a period, was as wilted as an eggplant hit by frost.\nFootnote 2: \"As wilted as an eggplant hit by frost,\" an idiom describing someone who is utterly dejected or demoralized.\n\nFurthermore, Yunmeng 749's confinement wasn't merely about being locked up.\n\nOne also had to endure torture.\n\nBai Hemian had endured a full set back then, which triggered a congenital hidden ailment within him.\n\nIf Xie Shunan hadn't accidentally discovered the Yimu Knot.\n\nBai Hemian's injuries might never have healed.\n\nTherefore, Chen An was in for a lot of suffering during this confinement.\n\nSeeing Chou Si still scolding Chen An like a son.\n\nLu Ding silently walked out, taking Bai Hemian with him.\n\nAfter all, he wasn't a Yunmeng 749 investigator.\n\nIt wasn't appropriate to listen to too much of their internal affairs.\n\nUpon reaching the doorway.\n\nBai Hemian, arms crossed, said: \"How about we leave? This place feels uncomfortable to stay in, it's a bit strange.\"\n\nLu Ding felt the same way.\n\nHe felt as if trouble followed him wherever he went.\n\nIt was fine originally.\n\nAs soon as he arrived, oh snap, the situation immediately descended into chaos.\n\nAnd it was getting late now.\n\nThey would only be at Yunmeng 749 for a few hours; they had to leave at dawn tomorrow.\n\nFurthermore, the location of the Golden Toad Embracing Egg Bureau, where they were headed next, wasn't accessible by plane or high-speed rail.\n\nIt was deep in the mountains of the northwest.\n\nSo, going early or late didn't make much difference; he had already obtained the Qu family's items anyway.\n\nContribution points would still take some time.\n\nIn the meantime.\n\nIf he didn't do something and just stayed put, Lu Ding felt an itch all over his body.\n\nHe didn't feel right.\n\nLu Ding nodded: \"Alright!\"\n\nHe took out his phone and sent a message to Chou Si, who was still scolding someone in the room.\n\n【Director Chou, apologies for the disturbance this time. We'll visit again next time. Thank you for your hospitality tonight.】\n\nAfter sending it, he opened his map.\n\nAfter checking the directions.\n\nLu Ding raised a hand and pointed: \"Let's go!\"\n\nThe two, one flying and one in stealth.\n\nOne ascended to the sky, one went into stealth.\n\nAfter the two had been gone for quite a while.\n\nIn the room.\n\nChou Si had just popped a pill into Chen An's mouth.\n\nHe said earnestly: \"You, you should learn more from others in the future.\"\n\nHe got up, took out his phone, wanting to ask where Lu Ding and the others had gone, but then he saw Lu Ding's message.\n\nChou Si fumed again, bent down, and slapped Chen An on the head with a crisp sound.\n\nSlap!\n\n\"Goddamn it, after you come out of a year's confinement, if you can work, then work; if not, get lost. Looking at you, I don't even get annoyed by others.\"\n\nOriginally, he wanted to keep Lu Ding around to give a speech or something, to set an example for Yunmeng 749 investigators.\n\nBut they left!\n\nChou Si, growing more furious the more he thought about it, added another curse: \"Crawl back yourself!!\"\n\nChen An, who had recovered a trace of strength, was utterly bewildered.\n\nNo, what did I do? I already got beaten up, almost died. I didn't say anything just now.\n\nWhat's being blamed on me again now?",

    "content": "Meanwhile, under the cover of night.\n\nThe Golden Toad Embracing Egg Bureau was located to the northwest.\n\nMore precisely, it was right next to the Gobi Deserted Mountains.\n\nThey swept straight ahead all the way.\n\nMid-air, Lu Ding was holding Bai Hemian by the scruff of his neck.\n\nHis eyes constantly scanned the ground below. Originally, they were supposed to fly their separate ways, one flying, one darting.\n\nBut later, Lu Ding found Bai Hemian too slow.\n\nHe swooped down, grabbed him by the scruff of the neck, and dragged him along, flooring the accelerator.\n\nTheir speed instantly shot up!\n\nThere was just one problem.\n\nBai Hemian felt a bit choked.\n\nHe looked up: \"How about you hold me somewhere else?\"\n\nLu Ding looked down and saw Bai Hemian's collar, which was practically trying to strangle him to death.\n\nLu Ding suppressed a laugh.\n\nFor some reason, the image of a Teru Teru Bozu* popped into his mind...\n\nHe switched hands and tossed him up slightly, and Bai Hemian immediately shot up a bit.\n\nLu Ding supported his back with a hand, applying forward force to counteract the downward pull.\n\nIt was like he was directly pushing him through the air.\n\nBai Hemian let out a long breath.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nThat was finally comfortable.\n\nWithout his collar trying to strangle him, his mood instantly improved significantly.\n\nHe turned his head to see Lu Ding scanning the forests below.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"I'm seeing if I can hunt for some monsters.\"\n\nThese deep mountains and old forests were perfect for monster hunting. Maybe he would encounter some lost spirits or monsters.\n\nOne quick chop.\n\nRewards credited.\n\nBut flying all this way, Lu Ding's luck must have been bad, as this place couldn't even compare to Dahei Mountain.\n\nAside from a couple of wandering souls occasionally drifting by,\n\nthere was absolutely nothing.\n\nBai Hemian couldn't quite understand what \"monster hunting\" meant, as he had never played games before.\n\nHe rarely chatted with people before and had no friends, so he naturally didn't know these things.\n\nHe secretly thought Lu Ding might be hungry.\n\nAnd wanted to hunt some wild game.\n\nHe said, \"Wild animals are rare in places like this. Grandma said this area used to be barren.\"\n\n\"She told me a story once. She said that in ancient times, even firewood could be sold for a good price, because people back then didn't protect the environment. If there was grass on the mountain, they'd cut it; if there were trees, they'd chop them down.\"\n\n\"During years of disaster, it was even more desolate, with not even a single root of grass left.\"\n\n\"Some places did have trees and grass, but those belonged to the wealthy landowners. If ordinary people secretly went to chop wood or cut grass, they'd get their hands and feet chopped off if caught.\"\n\n\"Grandma said that it was my grandpa's generation who came here to plant trees, and that's how it became so lush and green today.\"\n\n\"I've never met my grandpa. Grandma said he came here and never went back.\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding also realized that such a place indeed couldn't sustain many wild animals.\n\nMoreover, the forest grew later; even if there were wild animals, they would have come much later.\n\nWith not many years passed, how could they have become spirits?\n\nThis fundamentally cut off the origin of demons and monsters.\n\nThen he heard Bai Hemian talk about his grandpa.\n\nLu Ding had intended to offer some comfort, perhaps saying that the old man might have been unable to return for some reason.\n\nAnyway, trying to put a positive spin on it.\n\nWho knew Bai Hemian would just blurt out:\n\n\"He's probably dead.\"\n\nLu Ding: ...\n\nHonesty is a good quality, but I advise you not to be *too* honest.\n\nLu Ding thought for a moment.\n\n\"Hmm... have you ever considered...\"\n\n\"Or, like in the TV shows Grandma watches, he found another wife here, married a rich family's daughter, leaving Grandma alone in a dilapidated shack to dig for wild vegetables.\"\n\nLu Ding: ...\n\n\"Actually...\"\n\n\"No wonder Grandma cries every time she watches, it turns out she was thinking Grandpa might have done the same thing.\"\n\nLu Ding: \"Hahahahaha, your thought is too...\"\n\n\"He's truly a piece of trash!!\"\n\nLu Ding: I'm not saying another damn word!!\n\nEvery time Lu Ding tried to steer the conversation in a slightly more positive direction,\n\nBai Hemian would interrupt immediately, speaking words that were...\n\nLike a wild dog let loose, charging out and never looking back.\n\nAlways heading straight for the worst possible interpretation.\n\nIn the end, he even got worked up himself.\n\nHis eyes were practically glowing green.\n\nLooking exactly like he was about to tear someone apart.\n\nSigh...\n\nLu Ding couldn't be bothered to say anything more. Let the kid think what he wants; it had been so many years already.\n\nTo speak an unpleasant truth, his grandpa was probably long gone, so there wouldn't be any 'grandson tearing grandpa apart' drama.\n\nA grandson personally tearing his grandpa apart, just to get revenge for grandma.\n\nAlthough it sounded a bit off.\n\nBut with Bai Hemian, whose mind didn't turn, he could truly do something like that.\n\nThe kind you simply couldn't stop.\n\nLu Ding had spent a considerable amount of time with him and knew Bai Hemian's temper: once he made up his mind about something, he rarely changed it.\n\nMoreover, 'Grandma' held the highest and most supreme position in Bai Hemian's heart.\n\n\"What were you trying to say just now?\"\n\nLu Ding: ...\n\nNow you're asking me?\n\nThe child is dead, and you're offering milk. The car hit the wall, and you know to turn. Snot's in your mouth, and you know to flick it away.\n\nLu Ding offered a faint smile. \"It's nothing. As long as you're happy.\"\n\nWhat else could he do?\n\nIf, by some one-in-a-million chance, such a situation arose, Lu Ding could only go along with it.\n\nWhen he fought Si Ming, Bai Hemian didn't even blink and followed suit.\n\nNow that Bai Hemian was putting on a show of a filial grandson personally tearing his grandpa apart, at most Lu Ding would just close his eyes and go along with it.\n\nWhat were those rhymes again?\n\nThe flowers on the other shore are not flowers, a flurry of punches kills the old bastard.\n\nEven tigers don't eat their cubs, old geezer, die for me... Eight hundred li, roasted meat shared among the troops, Corpse Ridge Mountain, reversing the celestial order...\n\nLu Ding quickly shook his head.\n\nClearing his mind of all that chaotic nonsense.\n\nThe wind whistled in his ears. Bai Hemian pointed forward. \"Someone's there.\"\n\nLooking into the distance, specks of light could be seen, and the view zoomed in.\n\nA person was running incredibly fast through the mountains and forests in the dark, sticking something haphazardly onto himself as he ran.\n\nBehind him, over a dozen people were hot on his heels.\n\nTheir movements were similar to his; as they chased, they too were sticking things onto themselves.\n\nThe view zoomed in.\n\nCao Ying cursed without looking back.\n\n\"Damn it, Li Daquezi, I'll give you the Wind-Calming Pearl, just stop chasing me!\"\n\nFrom the dense forest behind him,\n\na massive, single-legged creature stomped down, covering hundreds of meters in a single leap, crushing and trampling the ground.\n\nCao Ying lunged forward sharply.\n\nHe heard a 'Boom!' and the spot he had just passed was covered by that single foot; the half-protruding rocks on the ground turned into powder.\n\nThe single-legged creature leaped another hundred meters, leaving behind footprints tens of meters deep when it moved away.\n\nLi Daquezi cursed back.\n\n\"Cao Ying, damn you, damn you! Is it the Wind-Calming Pearl I want? What I want is your life!!!\"\n\n\"You snatched the Ganoderma Human and Ganoderma Horse, ruining my reputation. Originally, we were supposed to settle this score later: you be the big boss of Caojia Lane, living in the city.\"\n\n\"And I'd continue being my treasure seeker, walking the mountains!\"\n---\n*   **Teru Teru Bozu:** A traditional Japanese doll, often handmade from white cloth or paper, said to ward off rain and bring good weather.",

    "content": "「But you, you motherfucker, stealing the Zhīrén Zhīmǎ wasn't enough, you still wanted to steal my golden egg!! And you killed my two brothers-in-law!」\n\n「Now the Golden Toad has been startled by you, hiding underground and won't come out. I truly fuck you, I'm not done with you!!」\n\nCao Ying affixed another Spirit Charger Talisman to himself.\n\nHe suddenly rolled forward, dodging another of Li the Cripple's attacks.\n\nUnforgiving with his words, he continued to retort, saying, 「Zhīrén Zhīmǎ, that's because you're not skilled enough. You don't have a Wind-Calming Pearl, so you can't get up Dingfeng Mountain. What the hell do you want Zhīrén Zhīmǎ for?」\n\n「Besides, those two brothers-in-law of yours weren't killed by me either. If you have a problem, go find Bai. He killed your brothers-in-law, not me.」\n\nThe more Cao Ying thought about it, the angrier he got.\n\nOriginally, he was doing perfectly fine in Yunhai, being his own boss.\n\nCounting money every day until his hands cramped.\n\nBut how could a treasure hunter, accustomed to roaming the mountains, get used to prolonged city life?\n\nSo.\n\nSome time ago, he heard people say that on Ba'er Mountain, there was a Golden Toad guarding an egg, and it was a Golden Hen Egg.\n\nCao Ying immediately got an idea.\n\nHe had to get it.\n\nBa'er Mountain and Dingfeng Mountain were adjacent, and he had a Wind-Calming Pearl. He hadn't even finished exploring Dingfeng Mountain last time.\n\nNow something new had appeared on Ba'er Mountain.\n\nHe absolutely had to come take a look.\n\nMoreover, with the Wind-Calming Pearl on him, if anything went wrong, he could just burrow into Dingfeng Mountain. The natural barrier was there.\n\nNo one could do anything about it.\n\nLast time, when he introduced the Yunmeng Global Gathering to Lu Ding and the others, Cao Ying was just about to set off.\n\nBut when he arrived.\n\nHey!\n\nHe ran into Li the Cripple.\n\nGuess what?\n\nThe news of the Golden Toad guarding an egg on Ba'er Mountain was intentionally spread by Li the Cripple to lure Cao Ying.\n\nThe thing did exist, but it wasn't easy to get.\n\nLi the Cripple was also calculating in his heart: if Cao Ying came, he would kill Cao Ying first, then retrieve the egg, killing two birds with one stone — revenge and treasure.\n\nIf Cao Ying didn't come.\n\nThen so be it.\n\nHe'd kill him next time.\n\nAs it turned out, Cao Ying really came, and he even circled around via Dingfeng Mountain. This guy wasn't stupid, huh.\n\nHe really used the Wind-Calming Pearl.\n\nAnd so, Li the Cripple's front-facing traps were bypassed by Cao Ying, who came up from behind.\n\nBut!\n\nCao Ying underestimated the Golden Toad's alertness. This creature had been disturbed many times before and had grown smarter.\n\nNow, as soon as Cao Ying startled it, it hid underground and wouldn't come out.\n\nAt that time, the ones guarding the rear were Li the Cripple's two brothers-in-law.\n\nCao Ying's wasted trip had already made him furious, and then he saw Li the Cripple's brothers-in-law.\n\nAt this point, Cao Ying waved, 「Hey, you two fools, come here and let grandpa tease you for a bit.」\n\nAs he teased, they got angry.\n\nThey couldn't take a joke.\n\nThey wailed and wailed, determined to kill Cao Ying.\n\nCao Ying looked and thought, 「How boring, you're kicking up sand when we're just playing.」\n\nHe simply kicked Li the Cripple's two brothers-in-law into a ditch.\n\nThe result!\n\nIt was that kick.\n\nHey, goddammit, there was another group of local Northwest people in the ditch.\n\nThey were digging tunnels below, preparing to excavate the Golden Toad.\n\nLi the Cripple's brothers-in-law fell down, precisely ruining their good thing.\n\nHow could they let you live? Everyone was in the mountains, and no one would meddle.\n\nSo they simply chopped them open with two knives.\n\nWhen Li the Cripple belatedly went to look for them.\n\nThey asked him, 「Were they one tall and one short, one fat and one thin?」\n\nLi the Cripple: 「Uh-huh!」\n\nThey said: 「Then it's fine. The short one was scared to death.」\n\nLi the Cripple: 「What about the tall one?」\n\nThey said: 「He's dead too.」\n\nLi the Cripple knew he couldn't beat them; even a strong dragon doesn't oppress a local snake.\n\nSuppressing his anger, he asked: 「How did they die?」\n\nThey said: 「The big one was chopped up by us, shorter than the short one now.」\n\nLi the Cripple felt his blood rush to his brain, and his vision went black.\n\nSpeaking without thinking, he subconsciously blurted out: 「What about the short one?」\n\nThey told him: 「He was scared to death on the spot, didn't I just tell you?」\n\nWhat happened in between, Li the Cripple didn't remember. What happened afterward, Li the Cripple didn't want to remember.\n\nAnyway!\n\n「Cao Ying, fuck you!!!」\n\nIt was a chase all the way, like a dog chasing a rabbit, refusing to let go.\n\nChasing him all the way to this forest.\n\nOriginally, Li the Cripple subconsciously tried not to think about these things, but now, prompted by Cao Ying.\n\nHis chest was heaving continuously, so furious that his face turned red!\n\nIf you ask why.\n\nHe couldn't deal with Bai.\n\nHe could only bully Cao Ying, who was an old enemy.\n\nIf you slap a \"shit pot\" on someone, even if it's not yours, it becomes yours.\n\nSeeing people surrounding him from all directions.\n\nCao Ying had nowhere to run, nowhere to retreat.\n\nA mocking smile on his face, he hadn't brought many people this time to begin with.\n\nHe had suffered heavy losses last time, not many brothers were left, and the Wind-Calming Pearl's range was limited.\n\nAs a result, he went in lightly armed and encountered others who were fully equipped.\n\nA knife runner met a fully geared guy.\n\nCao Ying accepted defeat, leaning against a large tree: 「Li the Cripple, let's talk. How much money will it take to buy my life?」\n\nLi the Cripple walked over, moving his magically enlarged leg, dozens of meters long.\n\n「I don't want money, I want your life. Today, you'll be chopped into eight pieces!!」\n\nAs he said this, Li the Cripple held up his hand, making the gesture for eight.\n\nCao Ying nodded: 「Alright, I'm not someone who's afraid to die, but we've been fighting for so many years, isn't it fair to let me leave a last message?」\n\nLi the Cripple raised an eyebrow: 「Fine.」\n\nCao Ying thought for a moment. Grand-Grandpa was probably still in seclusion, digesting the essence of Zhīrén Zhīmǎ.\n\nHe wouldn't receive messages.\n\nHaving roamed the mountains for so many years, he didn't have many proper friends. Everyone hid their true intentions.\n\nSmiling on the surface, backstabbing behind their backs.\n\nNever mind.\n\nHe'd send it to Lu Ding and the others, asking them to tell his family later.\n\nHe took out his phone.\n\nOpened the group chat, and pressed the voice message button.\n\n「Brother Lu, Feifan, and Baidiao, whom I've only met a few times, your brother here has stumbled, as a horse might trip. There's nothing I can do, my life ends here, and my luck isn't good.」\n\n「Your brother will take a step ahead. Tomorrow, on the seventh day of my passing, next year's Qingming and Chongyang, remember to talk to me, chat about idle things.」\n\n「Especially Brother Lu, though we haven't known each other long, our bond is absolutely solid. If not false heroes pitying each other, then definitely true villains with similar tastes.」\n\n「Too bad you're so busy, and we haven't had many good chats or drinks.....」\n\n「I'm rambling too much, so I'll stop here.」\n\nAfter Cao Ying finished speaking, he flicked his phone.\n\nHe thrust his head forward, extending his neck: 「Come!」\n\nJust as Li the Cripple raised his foot to stomp down.\n\nFrom the silent forest, Cao Ying's voice, amplified by the phone's speaker, was heard.\n\n「Brother Lu, Feifan...」\n\nThis sound made Cao Ying and Li the Cripple both look at the phone he had just flung away.\n\nThat's right, the screen was off.\n\nSo where was this sound coming from?\n\nLi the Cripple frowned, looking left and right, finally fixing his gaze on the large tree behind Cao Ying.\n\nAt this very moment, a surging, blood-stirring wave of sound exploded.\n\n「BZZZZ!!!!」\n\nFrom behind the tree, two heads emerged.\n\nEach embedded with a pair of dark red eyes that disdained all beings, and a pair of pale green eyes indifferent to life and death.",

    "content": "Aura filled the air, with mountains of corpses towering and demonic dragons peering out.\n\nSpiritual energy surged from within their bodies, rising to the sky.\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian walked out from either side of a large tree.\n\nThe tall tree seemed like a dividing line.\n\nSeparating the two surges of aura.\n\nDarkness was diffused by two kinds of light. Lu Ding, meanwhile, was spewing spiritual energy, with black smoke bubbling from his entire body.\n\nHe raised a hand.\n\nThe light from his phone screen illuminated the side of his face.\n\nLooking with cold eyes, Lu Ding’s voice was frosty: “Who are you going to kill?”\n\nCao Ying was shocked.\n\nHe turned his head left: Bai Hemian.\n\nHe turned his head right: Lu Ding!!\n\nHeh! Bros, I can live!\n\nHe was about to spring up with a carp flip.\n\nLi the Lame’s face darkened; he couldn’t bother with all that anymore.\n\nHaving run around in the mountains for all these years, could he possibly be intimidated by a few young upstarts?!\n\nHis body twisted in the air, exerting force, and the giant foot, magically expanded to dozens of meters, swept towards the three of them!!!\n\nLu Ding stepped forward, and a halo lit up behind him.\n\nThere was a dull thud.\n\nHe raised a hand to block, effortlessly stopping Li the Lame’s kick.\n\nThis scene startled Li the Lame for a moment.\n\nHis kick could fell a century-old gnarled tree, scattering its roots and sending it to its demise.\n\nThis person could block it with a raised hand; he seemed to be no benevolent character.\n\nAt this moment, Cao Ying also stood up, pointing a finger: “Li the Lame, you’re finished!”\n\nLu Ding made a move, spiritual energy gathered on his palm, which he wielded like a blade, chopping down.\n\n“Ah!!!!!!”\n\nLi the Lame’s giant foot was severed at the ankle.\n\nLi the Lame’s spell was broken, his giant foot returned to its original size, and he fell to the ground, screaming incessantly, spitting mouthfuls of blood.\n\nThe backlash was severe.\n\nHe retreated, propping himself up with his elbows, fear flickering in his eyes: “Attack!!”\n\n“All of you, attack!!!”\n\nA group of henchmen, who relied on him for their livelihood in the mountains, instantly charged towards Lu Ding.\n\nThe next moment.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand and waved gently; an invisible slash burst forth.\n\nA scene of hellish carnage unfolded in the human world.\n\nHis former ‘brothers’ were now smeared across the ground.\n\nThe breeze stopped, a thick scent of blood filled the air, and a strand of hair slowly drifted down.\n\nOnly then did Li the Lame finally recognize who the newcomer was.\n\n“Lu Ding!! This bizarre slash!! You’re Yunhai’s Corpse-Dissecting Taisui, Lu Ding!!!”\n\n“How are you here? Weren’t you in Yunmeng?”\n\nCao Ying walked over, talking as he swung a slap: “We kept you alive to ask you questions, not for you to ask us questions.”\n\nBut having just fled, his spiritual energy was too depleted. Li the Lame ducked, dodging the slap.\n\nFollowing that, a crisp sound still rang out.\n\n*Slap!*\n\nBai Hemian’s slap followed right after, landing on the other side of his face.\n\nIt made him spit out a mouthful of blood, along with his front tooth.\n\n“You still dare to dodge!?”\n\nLi the Lame covered his face and looked at Lu Ding: “You... what do you want to ask?”\n\nLu Ding looked down at him: “How did you know I was in Yunmeng?”\n\nLi the Lame’s eyes flickered: “If I tell you, I can get a life, right?”\n\nCao Ying raised his hand for another slap.\n\nLi the Lame ducked again.\n\nCao Ying: “Eh heh!?”\n\nBai Hemian slapped him again, knocking out another tooth.\n\n“Still dodging!? Speak up quickly.”\n\nLi the Lame continued covering his face: “I know many people in the Tianli Cult; I heard it from them.”\n\nThat wasn’t surprising.\n\nLu Ding continued to ask: “Didn’t you tell your nephew you’d wait until Changhai finished harvesting the corn? Why did you come so early?”\n\nLi the Lame glanced left at Cao Ying and right at Bai Hemian, preparing to dodge.\n\n“If I tell you this, I can get a life, right? I’m already injured like this; I won’t amount to anything significant later.”\n\n“Did I tell you to bargain!”\n\nThe sound of wind rose again. Li the Lame ducked, dodging Cao Ying’s slap.\n\nAnticipating Bai Hemian’s slap, he tilted his head to the side again.\n\nThis caused Bai Hemian’s slap to miss.\n\nHe even felt a little fortunate, *heh*, didn’t hit him!\n\nThen Lu Ding raised his leg and kicked.\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nLi the Lame was sent flying from flat ground, stumbling and rolling over ten meters backward, crashing into a large rock. Cracks spread across the rock behind him, and blood gushed out again.\n\n“Did I tell you to dodge?”\n\nLu Ding said.\n\nIntense pain coursed through him. Li the Lame felt as if his internal organs had been shattered.\n\nHe coughed and spat blood incessantly.\n\nHe secretly cursed the trio for not following jianghu rules.\n\nTaking turns attacking him.\n\nHe dodged one, dodged two, but there was still Lu Ding, the third.\n\nAnd that motherfucker even kicked him.\n\n“Cough cough cough cough cough... I’ll tell you... I’ll tell you, stop hitting.”\n\nLi the Lame raised a hand to stop them: “It’s that bastard Changhai who doesn’t play by the rules! He told me he’d wait until the corn harvest was done, and I believed him!”\n\n“But he turned around and sold the information to the local contact here.”\n\n“I received some information, but it wasn’t accurate. To prevent further complications, I came over early, not planning to include him in the operation.”\n\n“But I just found out he sold the information to the Bai family.”\n\nThe Bai family?\n\nLu Ding subtly turned his head to glance at Bai Hemian.\n\nAs expected.\n\nWhen Bai Hemian heard that surname, the expression on his face instantly darkened.\n\nLu Ding made a mental note here.\n\n“What’s the situation with the Golden Toad Holding an Egg now?”\n\nThis time, Li the Lame didn’t dare to say anything about trading for his life.\n\nHe spoke without hesitation, roughly explaining the situation of the Golden Toad Holding an Egg formation to Lu Ding.\n\nMainly, Cao Ying had startled the golden toad.\n\nNow it had burrowed into the ground and wouldn’t come out.\n\nThe Bai family members were still digging over there earlier.\n\n“They were using a fengshui compass to pinpoint its location, but when I just left there, they seemed to be packing up too. The golden toad must have run off again.”\n\n“But it won’t run too far. The fengshui formation is only so big; it only has that much range of movement.”\n\nIt seemed this thing was quite hard to catch.\n\nLu Ding thought to himself.\n\nCao Ying, seeing him in thought, asked: “Brother Lu, are you here for this thing?”\n\nThis wasn’t a secret anyway.\n\nLu Ding was here now, so there was no harm in saying it.\n\n“That’s right. They’re building a road here, and the Golden Toad Holding an Egg formation is in the way. I came to deal with it.”\n\nCao Ying nodded, contemplating things in his mind.\n\nAt this moment, Bai Hemian, who had been silent, suddenly asked: “What’s this about the Bai family you just mentioned?”\n\n“Ah, this Bai family...”\n\n“Investigator Bai, just ask me. I know more than him.”\n\nLi the Lame glared at him. *Damn it, Cao, I gave you face, but you didn’t give me any face.*\n\n“You not only snatched my Spirit Ginseng and Spirit Ganoderma, you’re also snatching my chance to live!!!”\n\n“Then aren’t you useless?”\n\nLu Ding chimed in.\n\nLi the Lame instantly panicked.\n\n“I’m useful! I can still...”\n\nA slash cut through, severing Li the Lame and the rock behind him into two halves, dismembering him on the spot.\n\nLu Ding: “You can still rot here and be fertilizer.”",

Take them back for me and give them to Feifan; he should be able to use them.\"\n\nAt Lu Ding's realm and combat power, he no longer had any use for these things. But for Yan Feifan, these were all good items.\n\nCao Ying tucked the items away: \"Alright, I'll make sure to personally deliver them to Feifan. Speaking of which, Brother Lu, I just thought about it, if you have any ideas about this Golden Toad Embracing Egg Formation, I might be able to help. This thing has probably been handled by many people back and forth. It might be difficult for an average person to take it down, so we'll have to use a trick. I happen to know a slightly peculiar Moving Mountains Daoist. If she steps in, she'll definitely handle it.\"\n\n\"A bit peculiar?\" What kind of description was that? Lu Ding subconsciously looked at Bai Hemian and asked Cao Ying, \"Is she as peculiar as him?\"\n\nBai Hemian: ?????\n\nCao Ying grinned: \"They're different. The person I'm talking about is named Wang Qingge. Everything about her is good, except for one thing: she's too forgetful.\"\n\nLu Ding nodded: \"I can tell.\" That name, 'Forget Older Brother'². It didn't sound like a name a proper person would come up with. Lu Ding guessed she probably forgot her own name and then took another one later. But as Cao Ying continued speaking, Lu Ding realized his imagination wasn't big enough.\n\n\"How do I put this? Anyway, her explanation is that she's sick. I feel like it's Alzheimer's, but this person is truly terrifyingly strong. There's no technical skill involved; she's just brutally strong, relying entirely on muscle memory. She knows everything, excels at everything, but if you ask her, she'll just say she doesn't know or she forgot. And she's hard of hearing, absurdly so. It's not that she can't hear; her ears are fine, but whenever you talk to her, what you say means one thing, but what she hears is something else entirely. And the most important thing, which is why I said she's peculiar: she's not clean; there are unclean things on her.\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding's eyes lit up. Wasn't this an opportunity? Then he thought. That's not right. \"Didn't you say she was terrifyingly strong? She can't deal with the unclean things herself?\"\n\n\"What's on her is different from the usual. You can't see them at all, so there's no way to deal with them. You can only hear sounds, gibberish that you can't understand. But listening to it for too long will make you annoyed and give you a headache, guaranteed to lead to qi deviation. But she seems to be unable to hear it because she's hard of hearing. I reckon that's a blessing in disguise for her.\"\n\nThe more Lu Ding listened, the stranger it became. This was like stumbling upon a bug in the system. Can't see anything, can only hear sounds... And can't hear what's being said clearly. And it can even cause people to fall into qi deviation. Why did this description feel so familiar? But he couldn't grasp the main point.\n\n\"Brother Lu, do you want to call her?\"\n\nAlthough Lu Ding was somewhat interested in the things on this person, to be safe, he still asked first: \"Does this person have episodes? Like, mental episodes? Is her usual behavior normal?\" Lu Ding didn't want to bring in someone who would cause a lot of trouble.\n\nCao Ying waved his hand: \"Aside from the few issues I mentioned, she's very healthy, tougher than me. She can barely hear, hardly ever talks, and just loves watching ants move.\"\n\n\"Alright then, call her over to take a look first.\"\n\nLeave professional matters to professionals. Although Lu Ding considered his Feng Shui theories quite good, he learned them as an ordinary person. It was already good that he could use them in Jinshan previously. Now that this Golden Toad Embracing Egg could move, he truly had no way to deal with it.\n\nCao Ying walked aside to send a message. Lu Ding looked at the silent Bai Hemian: \"What are you thinking about?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking, could this Bai family be the one my grandfather left behind?\"\n\nIt seemed his earlier speculation had settled in his mind.\n\n\"What a coincidence that would be. It's probably just that they all have the surname Bai. How about this, when Cao Ying comes back, we'll ask him. Doesn't he know about it? If not, there are also people from the Bai family here; we can go and ask them directly.\"\n\nBai Hemian nodded, acknowledging Lu Ding's words.\n\nSoon, Cao Ying finished up. The two of them hadn't spoken in secret. He had heard clearly. He returned and said, \"Investigator Bai, what do you want to ask?\" Our Cao-jujube's mind was still sharp; he had heard the important parts earlier. But it went in one ear and out the other. Someone else's family business. No curiosity, no prying.\n\nBai Hemian then asked, \"What is the origin of this Bai family?\"\n\nLu Ding also chimed in, \"I just searched the 749 Database, and it turns out my clearance level isn't high enough.\"\n\nCao Ying led the way forward. \"Brother Lu, shall we talk as we walk?\"\n\nThe two followed suit.\n\nAlong the way, Cao Ying spoke. \"Ah, this Bai family, I happen to know a little, but not much. They say the Bai family's elder used to work officially for the State. He ate official rations and wore official boots. As for what he did, I'm not too clear, but I speculate he was probably researching something.\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding's heart sank. Although he hadn't met Bai Hemian's grandfather, from Bai Hemian's retelling of his grandmother's words, it was clear that the elder was definitely not ordinary. Moreover, Bai Hemian had also said that his grandmother was quite knowledgeable... And finally, Bai Hemian's excellent handwriting. Lu Ding wouldn't believe for a second that he had excellent grades in school. Someone who could barely use a phone was somewhat disconnected from technological society. Coupled with being slightly withdrawn—not a stereotype, but most children like that don't have particularly good grades. Bai Hemian was among that majority. Furthermore, Bai Hemian's situation was special. So, this excellent handwriting was most likely learned from his grandmother. If that were truly the case, if his grandmother was so formidable, then Bai Hemian's grandfather...\n\nCao Ying continued. \"Then, about forty-odd years ago, a big event happened here: a direct female descendant of the Golden Family married outside. This had never happened before. The one she married was the Bai family's elder. And the children born after she married still took the surname Bai. It was from that time that the Bai family gradually grew stronger, becoming the dominant force in the Northwest today, and maintaining a good relationship with the Golden Family.\"\n\nBai Hemian's face was grim enough to drip water. Lu Ding, standing beside him, asked, \"How old is your father?\"\n\nBai Hemian said in a low voice, \"After my grandfather passed away, our family was poor. My grandmother single-handedly raised my father. Because of a lack of money, he didn't marry my mother until he was over thirty, and then I came along...\"\n\nAt that moment, Bai Hemian's mind seemed to suddenly brighten. He understood Lu Ding's implication and finished speaking in one breath.\n\n---\n¹ \"Wandering adventurer\" (走江湖之人): Refers to people who travel around, often associated with martial arts, fortune-telling, or other trades.\n² \"Forget Older Brother\" (忘親哥): A pun on Wang Qingge's name (忘清歌, Wàng Qīnggē), where \"Qingge\" sounds similar to \"qīng gē\" (older brother). The character 忘 (wàng) means \"forget.\"",

    "content": "......\n\nThis made it impossible for Lu Ding to utter the rest of his words.\n\nHis father was over thirty when he had him, and Bai Hemian's actual age was over twenty.\n\nAdding that up, it's over fifty years.\n\n“Sigh......”\n\nLu Ding sighed, signaling Cao Ying to continue.\n\n“There was nothing after that. Brother Lu, you can't see the detailed information, likely because of what the Bai family patriarch did previously.”\n\n“And to be able to marry a direct descendant of the Golden Family, he himself is probably also a Qi Cultivator.”\n\n“Given that, any project a Qi Cultivator participates in... the confidentiality level must be high.”\n\nThat was true. Lu Ding was currently only a formal investigator; his status wasn't high enough.\n\nAfter listening, Bai Hemian asked a question that struck directly at the core.\n\n“What's the Bai family patriarch's name?”\n\nCao Ying shook his head: “I don't know that, but I do know that this time, the leader of the Bai family people who came is named Bai Baoche, from the Bai family's third generation.”\n\nBoom!!!!\n\nBai Hemian's aura instantly surged forth and spread out.\n\nCracks spread inch by inch across the ground.\n\nHis steps continued forward.\n\nThe hard ground, as he took one step after another, he recited word by word, sentence by sentence.\n\n“Jue, Xue, Feng, Bao, Lin.”\n\n“Cheng, Xing, De, Zhen, Guang.”\n\n“My grandma said, these are our family's generational names. I'm from the 'Bao' generation.”\n\n“My grandma said, I was originally supposed to be named Bai Baoyu, but that name was too delicate, too fragile, so she changed it to Hemian.”\n\n“My grandma said, if my grandpa didn't come back, I wouldn't have to follow the Bai family's generational names anymore; they were all dregs.”\n\nBai Hemian turned his head, and a sense of oppression instantly surged forth: “Do all of the Bai family's second-generation names have 'Feng' in them!?”\n\nCao Ying nodded with difficulty.\n\nThen Bai Hemian opened his clothes and carefully took off the necklace from his neck.\n\nHe opened the necklace; inside was a proportionally scaled-down photo of a deceased elderly person.\n\n“My grandma said, don't force it, don't go looking. If by chance you arrive in the Northwest, then represent (take) her*, and have a good look at the scenery here.”\n\n“Experience the local customs and traditions.”\n\n“Just what kind of wonderful person, what kind of beautiful scenery, made him not even return home...?”\n\n“My grandma said, this life was too bitter; in the next life, she wouldn't wait for him.”\n\n“My grandma said... said...”\n\nBai Hemian's voice was a little choked up.\n\nThe rest of his words couldn't be spoken; he just walked forward step by step.\n\nThe terrifying aura burst forth, destroying all the trees and forests around.\n\nUntil a hand pressed on his shoulder, suppressing his spiritual energy that was about to go berserk.\n\nLu Ding's voice was calm: “You're going the wrong way. Cao Ying said he knows the way, and he's willing to take us to the Bai family.”\n\nSpiritual energy surged, and the tears on his face disappeared.\n\nOnly a glint of tears remained in his eyes.\n\nBai Hemian shook his head: “Not the wrong way. Grandma said that after she was gone, I would have to live alone.”\n\n“Even if I encountered something monumental, I couldn't rush, couldn't panic. I had to live carefully and grow slowly.”\n\n“I can't afford to provoke the Golden Family. He's also a Qi Cultivator, having cultivated for so many years and developed such a large family; I can't beat him.”\n\n“I want to learn from you. I want to listen to Grandma's words. When I complete my mission, when I become strong, at that time, I will go find him!!”\n\nHe learns from the kind of person he's with.\n\nAlthough Bai Hemian didn't understand much, he would learn.\n\nThe most outstanding person he had ever seen was Lu Ding.\n\nLu Ding wouldn't act impulsively, nor would Lu Ding do something like an egg hitting a rock.\n\nFrom his perspective, if Lu Ding encountered someone he couldn't beat, he wouldn't provoke them; if he saw someone he couldn't afford to offend, he wouldn't go near them.\n\nSo Bai Hemian felt that he couldn't be impulsive either, couldn't do such a thing.\n\nHe was raised with great hardship by his grandma; he couldn't just go and get hurt, or die like that.\n\nHe wanted to become strong, very strong.\n\nWhen he felt it was enough, Bai Hemian would go and demand an answer for his grandma.\n\nHearing what he said, Lu Ding let out a breath.\n\nFor a moment, he didn't know what to say in his heart.\n\nIt was unexpected, yet within reason.\n\nThis shouldn't have been what the original Bai Hemian would do or say.\n\nBut now he did it, and he said it.\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding felt a faint sense of pride for having influenced a stubborn person with his own habits.\n\nHis tone became light: “I almost started gathering my power.”\n\nFor Lu Ding, this matter wasn't a question of being rational or not.\n\nIt was that if Bai Hemian went, he would definitely follow.\n\nBut he would think of a backup plan. Lu Ding would find a way to cover them, ensuring both could survive.\n\nThen Bai Hemian said something astonishing.\n\n“If you start gathering power now and go over there...”\n\n“Are you going to chop my grandpa like a Stone Dare-to-Defy**?”\n\nThis remark truly was 'great filial piety that shakes the hall'***.\n\nConsidering Bai Hemian's relationship with the 'grandpa' he spoke of.\n\nLu Ding laughed without restraint.\n\n“You could understand it that way.”\n\nTurning, he waved at Cao Ying: “Don't just stand there dazed, let's go!”\n\nThe three quickened their pace towards the Ba'er Mountain railway construction site.\n\nAs for the matter of the Bai family still being in this area.\n\nLu Ding and Cao Ying tacitly avoided mentioning it.\n\nBai Hemian also subconsciously tried not to think about it.\n\nBut.\n\nAs is often the case, sworn enemies are bound to meet.\n\nAt the Ba'er Mountain construction site.\n\nA group of Bai family members blocked the gate, negotiating with two 749 investigators from the construction site.\n\nListen.\n\n“Investigator Wu, we're discussing this amicably now.”\n\n“Now, the Ba'er Mountain project is delayed, and the culprit is in the Golden Toad Holding Egg.”\n\n“You lend us the equipment, we'll deal with the Golden Toad. Then you'll save trouble, and we'll save trouble. Don't you think that's logical?”\n\nThe Golden Toad had become too elusive, drilling everywhere underground. Manually digging and searching would damage the Feng Shui veins, which would be too troublesome.\n\nUnless it was the most powerful few among these Qi Cultivators, blasting away day and night.\n\nToo tiring!\n\nSo, they set their sights on the construction site's equipment.\n\nUsing this stuff would definitely be more comfortable than exhausting themselves.\n\nAlthough it would be easier for them.\n\nBut for the construction site, this was illegal.\n\nFor the two investigators at the site, Wu Yishuang and Yu Qingli, this was a violation of regulations.\n\nIf they so much as nodded, they would be taking on the risk. If the road was opened and nothing went wrong, there would be no credit, because the higher-ups had said someone would come to solve the problem here, and they would arrive soon.\n\nOnce something went wrong, both would be punished.\n\nTherefore, both had a firm attitude: “No!!”\n\nThese two words popped out.\n\nThe man shook his head helplessly, his smile mocking:\n\n“Are you two not understanding what I'm saying? We said it's a win-win, mutual benefit. You get the road open, we get the treasure. If not, I can give you some benefits!”\n\n“Just tell me how much you want.”\n\nAs soon as these words left his mouth, the nature of the situation changed.\n\nThe law enforcement recorder wasn't just for show.\n\nYu Qingli took out her 749 identification and held it level: “I'm warning you for the first time now. Leave here immediately.”\n\nThe man raised his hands, signaling he wasn't making a move, but his mouth kept going.\n\n“You don't need to do a second or third warning. The inside of the construction site is yours, but the outside isn't, right? We just want to borrow some tools, don't get excited.”\n\n“If you don't lend them, then we'll just stand here and show our sincerity until you see our sincerity.”\n\nSuddenly.\n\nA figure flew over, kicking the speaker in the back.\n\nThe man immediately flew out and crashed into a pile of rubble, bleeding from his head.\n\nLu Ding pointed at him: “Go, go back and bring your mother for me to borrow for a bit.”\n\n---\n*   The original text plays on the similar pronunciation of '代' (dài, to represent) and '帶' (dài, to bring/take).\n**   石敢當 (Shígǎndāng) refers to a type of stone tablet or block traditionally used in Chinese culture to ward off evil spirits or bad luck, often placed at crossroads or against walls.

'鬨堂' refers to a hall erupting in laughter or uproar, while '大孝' means great filial piety.

    "content": ".....\n\nFrom a distance, you could already hear this person's idiotic remarks.\n\nGoing on about 'what's it like inside the construction site, what's it like outside the construction site'.\n\nAs if it's a movie.\n\nSeeing their own people being beaten, the other Qi practitioners from the Bai family group were about to make a move.\n\nOne of them charged forward impulsively.\n\nLu Ding backhanded him, sending him flying into the air, then grabbed his hair and violently slammed him to the ground.\n\nStill holding him by the hair, he lifted that blood-soaked face.\n\nHe slowly raised his hand and pointed across the crowd, his contemptuous gaze following.\n\nThen Lu Ding spoke: \"Who dares to move, let me see?\"\n\nAs these words left his mouth, coupled with his ruthless display, everyone was immediately intimidated.\n\nBai Hemian and Cao Ying arrived shortly after.\n\nIn the pile of rubble.\n\nThe young man who was kicked out initially struggled to get up.\n\nHe walked over, his steps somewhat unsteady.\n\nHe shook his groggy head.\n\nWhen he was still a few meters away from Lu Ding, he said: \"You goddamn—...\"\n\nBANG!!!!\n\nThis time, Bai Hemian's strike was even faster and heavier than Lu Ding's.\n\nThe man was sent flying backward dozens of meters once more, landing back in the pile of rubble.\n\n\"Stay down. If you get up one more time, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThis had nothing to do with work; it was purely a personal grudge.\n\nJust thinking that these people shared the same surname, Bai, as him made Bai Hemian sick.\n\nLu Ding casually tossed the Bai family member he was holding.\n\nLu Ding glanced at them, then pointed to the empty ground nearby.\n\n\"Didn't you want to see sincerity? Go, kneel over there. You can leave when day breaks.\"\n\nUpon hearing this.\n\nThe faces of this group of Qi practitioners with the surname Bai all changed.\n\nA tall man walked out from the crowd.\n\nHis gaze fell on Lu Ding's shoulder insignia.\n\n\"Investigator, we were indeed in the wrong today, but asking us to kneel, that might not quite align with your bureau's Qi Practitioner Management Regulations, right?\"\n\n\"Besides, he was the one who caused trouble just now.\"\n\nHe pointed at the unconscious young man in the pile of rubble and continued: \"He's already been punished. This doesn't concern us, does it?\"\n\nLu Ding took a step forward.\n\n\"It seems you know a lot about the Qi Practitioner Management Regulations.\"\n\nThe man nodded noncommittally.\n\nThe next moment.\n\nLu Ding removed his shoulder insignia and brandished it at him.\n\n\"Perhaps you understand the law, but you probably don't understand me. This is how I do things. If you're not convinced, feel free to report me.\"\n\n\"If you're displeased, you can also come challenge me.\"\n\nThe reason he said all this was to set the stage for what he was about to say.\n\n\"They, go kneel over there until daybreak, and you, the one who stuck his neck out...\"*\n\nLu Ding pointed to the ground at his feet: \"You have to kneel right here, and keep kneeling until I'm satisfied.\"\n\nThe man frowned: \"We don't have any grudges, do we?\"\n\nLu Ding shook his head: \"No, of course not. I just find you annoying, and I want to humiliate you.\"\n\n\"If you don't kneel, I'll beat you to a pulp right here.\"\n\n\"If, while kneeling, you move a single step or even twitch, I will make you watch your own brains spill out.\"\n\nWhen facing a straightforward enemy, superfluous talk is always unnecessary.\n\nBut when facing someone who likes to play petty tricks and doesn't know their place...\n\n...you have to talk some trash to make them uncomfortable and disgusted.\n\nYet their lack of strength means they can't defeat you, and they can't stand you.\n\nThis makes it even harder for them.\n\nSuch was the case for Bai Baoquan at that moment.\n\nHis emotions were suppressed in his heart, feeling as disgusted as if he had eaten a mouthful of dead flies*.\n\nBut he didn't dare to spit it out.\n\nBecause he saw Lu Ding, who seemed to have casually turned off his body camera.\n\nHis heart instantly began to pound wildly.\n\nHe then glanced sideways at Bai Hemian, only to see that he had also turned off his body camera, and then stepped in front of the two investigators from the construction site.\n\nBai Baoquan: Damn it, they're serious!\n\nTo put it bluntly, why did they dare to kill Li Daquezi's brother-in-law?\n\nIt's because this is in the mountains.\n\nFew people cared about the grudges of Qi practitioners in the mountains.\n\nThey could cut them up and mince them as they pleased.\n\nRobbing treasures and killing people; if the people don't report, the officials won't investigate*.\n\nThe reason they dared to provoke the investigators here was also because this was in the mountains.\n\nThe difference was, they could skirt the rules, but 749's investigators had to play by them.\n\nOtherwise, if a conflict arose, there would be no 749 support here. If a conflict broke out, it would just be the two investigators from the construction site.\n\nA single tree cannot support a tottering building*, and it would be difficult to resolve in the end.\n\nUltimately, the reason was that they weren't strong enough.\n\nBut now, someone strong enough had arrived. These Bai family Qi practitioners had only been skirting the rules.\n\nLu Ding was openly telling them, 'I'm not going to reason with you.'\n\nYou can only cooperate with me. If you don't, I'll make your life hell.\n\nEven the stubborn fear the ruthless*.\n\n\"Not talking? Are you mute? Alright then, I'll give you three counts, three choices. Either kneel down properly before I finish counting to three...\"\n\n\"...or turn and run, or attack me.\"\n\n\"Three!\"\n\nNo sooner had the word 'Three' left his lips, Bai Baoquan immediately knelt down, looking up at Lu Ding.\n\nHis smile was forced, and his tongue traced the inside of his cheek.\n\n\"You're the boss, I submit.\"\n\nThe current situation was simply that the man was stronger than him. Although Bai Baoquan was seething with rage...\n\n...he didn't dare to show a single trace of it.\n\nBecause, when he used to roam the mountains, anyone who was unconvinced or resentful in front of him had been killed by him.\n\nHe knew deeply what kind of posture a weak person should adopt when trying to survive.\n\nBut in the end, he still couldn't be entirely flawless.\n\nLu Ding backhanded him with a slap.\n\nSLAP!!!\n\nIt wasn't very damaging, but it was extremely humiliating.\n\n\"If your tongue can't stay where it belongs, I don't mind cutting it out and stuffing it into your stomach!\"\n\nBlood slowly trickled from the corner of Bai Baoquan's mouth. He raised his hand and gave himself another full-force slap: \"Understood, you are right to teach me.\"\n\nLu Ding nodded in satisfaction, then turned around.\n\nAs he walked into the construction site, he pulled out his credentials and showed them to the two 749 investigators stationed there, overseeing the work.\n\nWhen Wu Yishuang and Yu Qingli saw the words 'Official Investigator' on Lu Ding's credentials...\n\n...they exchanged glances, both seeing surprise in the other's eyes.\n\nWithin 749, basic-level investigators were divided into three ranks: Intern Investigator, Official Investigator, and Senior Investigator.\n\nInvestigators were responsible for most special incident investigations, arrests, detentions, probes, and the oversight of certain special missions,\n\nas well as cooperation in specific situations.\n\nAbove them were Special Grade Investigators and Investigation Specialists.\n\nThese five ranks corresponded to the five points of a five-pointed star.\n\nThe two investigators stationed at this Ba'er Mountain construction site were Official Investigators.\n\nIn their opinion, this situation here would require at least two Senior Investigators.\n\nNow, only one Official Investigator had arrived... This...\n\nAt this thought, Bai Hemian walked over and also displayed his credentials.\n\nYu Qingli and Wu Yishuang's thoughts instantly shifted.\n\nTwo Official Investigators... This...\n\nTheir superiors couldn't be so muddled, so there was only one possibility.\n\nAlthough these two were only Official Investigators, they possessed abilities comparable to Senior Investigators.\n\nOr perhaps, in some areas, they were even superior to Senior Investigators.\n\nOtherwise, it would be impossible for them to be assigned here.\n\nAs they thought this, Yu Qingli and Wu Yishuang simultaneously realized...\n\n...regardless of which possibility, this time, it was settled!\n\nBoth straightened their postures and saluted: \"Greetings, Leader!\"\n\n---\n*   \"the one who stuck his neck out\": A Chinese idiom (出头鸟, chūtóuniǎo) literally \"bird that sticks its head out,\" refers to someone who stands out, takes the lead, or speaks out, often implying they'll be the first to suffer or be targeted.\n*   \"as if he had eaten a mouthful of dead flies\": A Chinese idiom (吃了一嘴死苍蝇, chīle yī zuǐ sǐ cāngying) meaning to feel utterly disgusted, nauseated, and resentful, often due to a humiliating or unpleasant situation.\n*   \"if the people don't report, the officials won't investigate\": A traditional Chinese saying (民不举官不纠, mín bù jǔ guān bù jiū) indicating that without a complaint or accusation from the public, authorities are unlikely to intervene or investigate.\n*   \"A single tree cannot support a tottering building\": A Chinese idiom (独木难支, dúmùnánzhī) meaning one person alone cannot cope with a difficult situation or a heavy burden; unsupported.\n*   \"Even the stubborn fear the ruthless\": A Chinese saying (愣的也怕横的, lèng de yě pà hèng de) implying that even stubborn or defiant people will back down when faced with someone truly ruthless, unreasonable, or formidable.",

Let's go to the office area to complete the formalities.\"\n\nThe necessary procedures still had to be followed.\n\nYu Qingli came forward to lead the way.\n\n\"This way, Leader.\"\n\nWhile pointing the way, she gave Wu Yishuang a look.\n\n'Quickly check their names, see if you can find any information.'\n\nWu Yishuang returned the gaze: 'Don't worry, don't worry, you lead the way, I'll hang back and search slowly. I'll send it to you when I find it.'\n\nAt the back of the group.\n\nWu Yishuang took out her phone and searched for Lu Ding and Bai Hemian's names in the 749 Organization's database.\n\nThe result was, she didn't know until she searched, and once she searched, she was shocked.\n\nAs she scrolled through the details page, her eyes widened.\n\nUnknowingly, Wu Yishuang's back gradually straightened, and the expression on her face became increasingly audacious.\n\n'No wonder they're so dominant, so there's a reason for this.....'\n\nHer eyes darted, and Wu Yishuang directly left the group and walked to the side.\n\nOver here.\n\nAt the temporary office area, Yu Qingli pushed open the door and said, \"Leaders, the conditions are a bit rudimentary for now. Please rest for a bit. As for accommodation, you might have to rough it tonight.\"\n\n\"This is all we have here for now........\"\n\nAs she spoke.\n\nA faint vibrating sound came from outside.\n\nIt was late at night, and although the sound wouldn't wake the workers, it was exceptionally clear to the ears of a Qi Refiner.\n\nLu Ding, thinking there was a situation, immediately walked out to check.\n\nHe saw that in the woods next to the construction site, a two-story wooden cabin had appeared at some unknown time.\n\nYu Qingli opened her mouth in astonishment; she felt like she was dreaming.\n\nIt was also then that her phone rang.\n\nYu Qingli answered, and Wu Yishuang's breathless voice came from the other end.\n\n\"Lu Taisui*, I've set up a two-story building for you and Bai Futu*. Please bear with it and stay there for the time being.\"\n\n\"Once my Spiritual Qi recovers, I'll perfect it for you two.\"\n\nYu Qingli swallowed a mouthful of saliva as she listened.\n\nIs this still you, Wu Yishuang.......?\n\nYour attitude changed too quickly, without any warning.\n\nLu Ding felt it was a bit too much trouble for them.\n\nHe was just about to say it wasn't necessary to go to such trouble.\n\nBut then Wu Yishuang's voice came again: \"You two chat first, Qingli, make sure to entertain the two leaders well!\"\n\nWith that, she hung up the phone.\n\nYu Qingli's heart also became cautious at this moment.\n\nShe led the two into the room again.\n\nOn one hand, she took out her phone to unlock it and process the formalities.\n\nOn the other hand, she found disposable teacups and a kettle.\n\nJust as she poured tea for the two.\n\n\"Leaders, please drink some tea first. The conditions are rudimentary, we.....\"\n\nBefore she could finish, hurried footsteps came from outside the door.\n\nSomeone pushed the door open and entered.\n\nYu Qingli was dumbfounded again.\n\nWho knew where Wu Yishuang had gotten this tea set in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThinking of what she had just said.\n\nThe empty paper cup in Yu Qingli's hand slowly deformed.\n\nVeins slightly bulged on her forehead.\n\nWu Yishuang, however, acted as if she hadn't seen anything, and immediately started setting up the tea set.\n\n\"My apologies, Lu Taisui, the conditions in the mountains are rudimentary, and the tea leaves are also of poorer quality. We're truly not prepared to receive you properly.\"\n\nAs she spoke.\n\nUnder Yu Qingli's shocked gaze, Wu Yishuang pulled out a small jade bottle.\n\nShe pulled out the stopper, and a refreshing fragrance immediately wafted out.\n\nShe poured some into the teacup meant for brewing, reached for boiling water, and slowly poured it in.\n\nInstantly, the aroma filled the air.\n\nYu Qingli:........\n\nAlright, alright, you Wu Yishuang, you're playing this game with me, aren't you!!\n\nI just spoke a second ago, and the next second you come to make a fool of me!\n\nTwice!! And it was two times in a row!!!\n\nAre you going to conjure up an Imperial Feast next?\n\n\"Lu Taisui, please drink up. I saw rabbits in the woods outside earlier, and the kitchen coincidentally has seasonings. I'll go catch two for you to roast.\"\n\nThis really made Lu Ding feel a bit awkward.\n\nPreviously, at the very beginning, the reason he chose Yan Feifan as an assistant.\n\nWas because it would be easier to interact between people of the same gender.\n\nIf he had chosen a girl at that time, interactions between different genders, both for him and the other person, would have been a bit reserved.\n\nThis was normal.\n\nBut it was not conducive to Lu Ding's plan for rapid development at the time.\n\nBut who would have thought, this person truly taught him a lesson today.\n\nToo enthusiastic, completely overwhelming, not reserved at all.\n\nNow, upon carefully observing Wu Yishuang, whether it was her appearance, her attitude and tone when speaking, or other aspects.\n\nEverything was beyond reproach.\n\nAnd this attitude, completely a social terrorist.\n\nLu Ding found it a bit unbearable.\n\n\"No, no need, it's late at night, don't go to such trouble, we're really not hungry.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing, it's nothing, it'll be ready soon, I'm very fast, Qingli, you entertain them first!\"\n\nBefore she even finished speaking, half her body was already out the door.\n\nYu Qingli's face darkened, then she turned around and changed her expression, replacing it with a smile for Lu Ding and Bai Hemian.\n\n\"Leaders, please sit for a moment, I'm going to get something.\"\n\nThen, she followed her out.\n\nAfter catching up to Wu Yishuang, she grabbed her by the collar and dragged her into the shadows.\n\nShe pushed her against the wall.\n\nThump!!!\n\nA direct wall slam.\n\n\"Speak! What on earth are you up to!?\"\n\nWu Yishuang raised her phone, an excited look on her face as she said, \"Of course, I'm clinging to power*!!!\"\n\n\"I just checked, you have no idea how valuable these two leaders are.\"\n\n\"Let me just put it this way, have you ever heard of anyone being directly admitted* into the Inaugural Martial Arts Competition?\"\n\nThis sentence truly refreshed Yu Qingli's understanding.\n\nThe words 'direct admission' and 'Inaugural Martial Arts Competition' were too far apart.\n\nIt was difficult to mix the two together.\n\nYu Qingli went to take the phone and carefully flipped through it to check.\n\nAs more and more information came into view, her expression gradually became quite telling.\n\nShe returned a look to Wu Yishuang.\n\nThe two successfully connected their signals.\n\nShe heard Yu Qingli say, \"Today I saw wild pheasants and quails flying in the ditch. You go catch rabbits, I'll go catch them, and we'll meet up later.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll prepare the seasonings while I'm at it.\"\n\nYu Qingli directly joined the fray, and the two split up.\n\nAt the same time.\n\nOn the other side of the mountain.\n\nBai Baocai sat in front of the bonfire.\n\nWaiting for Bai Baoquan and his group to return.\n\nBut the people didn't return.\n\nInstead, he received a message that made his blood pressure soar upon reading it.\n\n【Bro, we can't come back. There are two tough nuts from 749 Organization at the construction site, they're prickly. We're currently kneeling in a row here.】\n\nBai Baocai's grip gradually tightened, but then he remembered it was his own phone.\n\nIf he crushed it, no one else would feel bad.\n\nHe immediately let out a breath of pent-up frustration.\n\n\"Good, very good. I'd like to see just how tough these nuts are, to dare make my Bai family members kneel in a row!!!!\"\n\n---\n*   **Lu Taisui (陆太岁)** and **Bai Futu (白浮屠)** are honorific or powerful nicknames/titles. \"Taisui\" is often associated with formidable power or authority in Chinese folklore. \"Futu\" can refer to a pagoda, a Buddhist, or something powerful and imposing.\n*   **Clinging to power (抱大腿)**: The idiom literally means \"to hug a big leg,\" implying seeking patronage or support from someone powerful.\n*   **Directly admitted (保送)**: Refers to being admitted or recommended to a school or competition without needing to take an entrance exam or compete.",

    "content": "Outside, the Bai family might not have much prestige.\n\nBut looking across this Northwest region,\nWho dares not to give the Bai family a little deference?\n\nConflict is normal; those who kill in the mountains are all after hidden treasures, so if you enter this line of work, don't complain.\n\nAnd furthermore.\n\nNo one had ever dared to make the Bai family members kneel in a line.\n\nBai Baoc rose.\n\n\"Grab your gear, follow me!!\"\n\nThe group, mighty and imposing, crossed the mountains towards the Ba'ershan construction site.\n\nAs a result of this journey,\nBai Baoc just happened to run into Wu Yishuang, who had also come out to catch rabbits.\n\nIn the low bushes.\nWu Yishuang stood up, clutching the rabbit by the scruff of its neck.\n\nShe looked up.\nWell, well.\nIn the woods, pairs of eyes looked over; in the pitch black, it was truly unsettling.\n\nBai Baoc, who was leading, was even closer, less than a meter from her face.\n\nHe just quietly stared at her.\n\nEveryone had been at Ba'ershan recently, and while they didn't know each other, they had crossed paths and had some impression of each other.\n\nBai Baoc opened his mouth to ask: \"Who caused the trouble at the construction site?\"\n\nThe old saying goes, 'Troops and horses haven't moved, but provisions go first,' but there's something even more important than provisions, and that's intelligence.\n\nAlthough it wasn't a battle now, they were going to settle a score.\n\nUnder the premise of having an opportunity,\nThey definitely had to get clear intelligence.\n\nIf they encountered something unsolvable, then they'd reconsider.\n\nBeing careful ensures no major mistakes.\nRunning in the mountains often, if you weren't cautious, you would have been killed long ago.\n\nBut for Wu Yishuang,\nShe couldn't reveal a single bit of this information.\n\nIf she spoke today, it would be like betraying a comrade.\n\nNot to mention the high value of Lu Ding and Bai Hemian.\n\nWhether it was out of regulation or personal reasons,\nWu Yishuang couldn't say a word.\n\nStraightening up, head held high and chest out, just as Bai Baoc thought she was about to utter a threat or refuse to cooperate,\nWu Yishuang turned and ran, as if she had made a certain decision, without a trace of hesitation.\n\nAlthough she hadn't engaged in combat, she had only vaguely heard of Bai Baoc before.\n\nBut the other party had a numerical advantage, not running would be foolish; this wasn't a defensive position that needed to be held.\n\nAs long as she ran back to the construction site, Wu Yishuang believed Lu Ding would deal with this person.\n\nBai Baoc also didn't expect this person to turn and run.\n\nHe was stunned for a moment.\n\nThen he shouted angrily: \"Stop!!!\"\n\nWu Yishuang ran while pulling out her phone and sending a message to Yu Qingli: \"Quick, quick, go back and get people, Bai Baoc is attacking!!\"\n\n\"I am currently fighting him, it's very intense!!!\"\n\nBai Baoc overheard this sentence clearly, and immediately felt bewildered.\n\n\"I did intend to take action, but I didn't intend to fight *you*.\"\n\n\"I just chased you a bit, do you have no shame!!?\"\n\nBai Baoc truly couldn't hold back anymore.\n\nHe immediately channeled his *qi* to conjure a flying knife and shoot it; originally, he wanted to block Wu Yishuang's escape route.\n\nWho knew there really were people in this world foolish enough to run straight into the blade's path, huh?\n\nJust as Wu Yishuang was running along fine, she felt a cold glint pierce her back.\n\nIn her mind, short videos she had scrolled through in the past instantly appeared.\n\nA certain marketing account.\n\n【A certain fishing boat in the Great Han waters encountered a foreign warship, the captain shouted, 'May my name be singled out on the family register, may I be the first to be offered incense,'* and charged forward without blinking an eye.】\n\nComments below.\n\n【If you come to my home, I might not die if I ram into you, but if I ram into you, you will definitely die.】\n\n【Captain: You want to collide with me too? Then let's collide. I'll get injured, you'll lose your life.】\n\n【The bright path is right beneath our feet; as long as we crash into it, everything will be ours.】\n\n【Back then, my dad encountered a Zhenla** ship at sea. At the time, he wanted to ram into it, but they ran so fast his fishing boat was utterly useless and couldn't catch up. When he came back, his thighs were bruised from slapping them.】\n\nThinking of these, Wu Yishuang again made a decision without hesitation.\n\nHer body shifted!\n\nDon't misunderstand, it wasn't dodging, but instead, she directly crashed into the flying knife, which was already a bit off target.\n\nThis scene scared Bai Baoc nearly out of his wits.\n\nAlthough in this Northwest region, everyone had to give the Bai family a little deference, even 749 was no exception.\n\nBut understood differently, the Bai family had to give 749 seven parts of deference.\n\nHis going to find Lu Ding involved personal grievances, which was within the understandable range.\n\nBut if he injured Wu Yishuang now, then.......\n\nBai Baoc quickly channeled his *qi* to try and change the flying knife's direction.\n\nBut it was already too late.\n\nThe flying knife passed through her body, stained with a bit of blood.\n\nWu Yishuang tumbled and rolled, then looked back and smiled: \"Hehehe.....\"\n\nThe laughter pulled at her wound, twisting her expression in pain.\n\nAlthough the wound wasn't severe, a wound is a wound, and it was a penetrating wound, with blood flowing out, making it look serious.\n\nAlthough Bai Baoc's surname was Bai (White), his face was now as black as the bottom of a pot.\n\n\"You damn well framed me!!!\"\n\n\"You assaulted a 749 investigator!!!\"\n\n\"You clearly ran into it yourself!!!\"\n\n\"You used a flying knife on me, and I didn't dodge it, you assaulted a 749 investigator!!!\"\n\n\"Go to hell, I just wanted you to stop running!!!\"\n\n\"But you used a flying knife, you assaulted a 749 investigator!!!\"\n\nBai Baoc felt his liver ache.\n\nHis vision was blurry.\n\nHis face was so gloomy it was almost dripping water.\n\nOnce this incident blew up today, things definitely wouldn't be good when he went back.\n\nOr else...\nThinking of this, Bai Baoc's face turned fierce.\n\nBut then he saw the body camera on Wu Yishuang's chest.\n\nInstantly, an invisible basin of cold water was poured over his head.\n\nWhat a disaster!!!!\n\nIf a 749 investigator died, they wouldn't reason with you; they'd immediately use their authority to start body camera footage playback.\n\nIf there was footage, they'd arrest based on the footage.\n\nIf there was no footage, they'd find the body camera to sense the fluctuations in the investigator's life *qi* and the location where it disappeared.\n\nThen they'd conduct a carpet search, directly plowing the area once.\n\nEven earthworms would be split vertically, and boiling water poured into ant nests.\n\nAnyone or anything with residual *qi* would be arrested and interrogated slowly.\n\nNot to mention Wu Yishuang had just sent a message, specifically naming him, Bai Baoc.\n\nNow, Bai Baoc, let alone having any improper thoughts.\n\nHe had to beg his ancestors, praying in his heart that Wu Yishuang wouldn't get into trouble in the next few days.\n\nOtherwise, even if he didn't kill her, he wouldn't be able to avoid a trip to 749.\n\nThe more Bai Baoc thought, the more frustrated he became, and he roared aloud.\n\n\"Get out!! Get out right now!!!\"\n\nHe had broken down; he had truly broken down.\n\nAfter this matter was over and he went back, he would definitely be punished. Not only would the Bai family punish him, but 749 would not let it rest either.\n\nThinking of these things, Bai Baoc secretly resented Wu Yishuang in his heart.\n\nBut on this point, Wu Yishuang indicated that she didn't know and didn't care; now she only had one question.\n\n\"Get out? Get out where?\"\n\n\"This won't do; I can't have taken this injury for nothing.\"\n\nShe sat on the ground, leaning against a tree, clutching her chest, her face squeezed together: \"Ouch, it hurts~~\"\n\nBai Baoc: ......\n\n\"I'm telling you, don't try to extort me!!\"\n\nSuddenly, out of the corner of Bai Baoc's eye, he glimpsed a dozens-of-meters-tall tree being uprooted and thrown towards him.\n\n\"You're looking for death!!!\"\n\nLu Ding arrived with the horizontally flying tree.\n\nWith his fist clenched, black smoke billowed out, and his whole demeanor changed.\n\nThe surrounding darkness instantly became viscous, tightly enveloping Bai Baoc, as if about to devour him.\n\nA sense of unease immediately arose in his heart.\n\n\"In this wild and desolate place, where did such a savage and terrifying demonic deviant come from!!!?\"\n\n---\n*   **May my name be singled out on the family register, may I be the first to be offered incense:** This is a traditional Chinese idiom expressing a willingness to make an ultimate, glorious sacrifice, even unto death, ensuring one's legacy and honor.\n**   **Zhenla:** An ancient kingdom in Southeast Asia, roughly modern-day Cambodia.",

    "content": "...\n\nThis black smoke, this spiritual energy, this ferocious expression!!!\nNo!!\nMust block!!\nMust block it!!\nIf that punch lands, he'll die!!!\n\nUnder the burst of his will to survive, Bai Baocu activated his spiritual energy, unleashing one hundred and twenty percent of his power. Originally, he could only control thirteen Jinghong Flying Daggers through thought. But at this moment, he had clearly made a breakthrough in battle, controlling the fourteenth Jinghong Flying Dagger. At such an age and at such a cultivation level, among the entire younger generation of the Northwest, Bai Baocu could be said to have ascended to heaven in a single step*. From the second echelon, he stepped into the first echelon.\n\nFourteen Jinghong Flying Daggers whirled and interchanged. They directly shredded the large tree Lu Ding had thrown. A surge of heroic spirit suddenly rose in Bai Baocu's heart. After today, his reputation for making a breakthrough in battle would surely spread throughout the Northwest! With fourteen Jinghong Flying Daggers, who could stop him! Who would dare to stop him!!? Just a mere demonic fiend, not worth mentioning.\n\n\"Die!\"\nHe even dared to shout, turning the tables, as fourteen Jinghong Flying Daggers circled around him, their aura sharp and fierce. Bai Baocu directly leaped up, charging towards Lu Ding's direction, intending to shred the incoming person with his flying daggers.\n\nSeeing this, a halo behind Lu Ding lit up, Flesh-Fiend erupted, and billows of black smoke shot straight into the sky. Propelled by his physical body, enveloped in spiritual energy, and infused with raw power, a terrifying punch was thrown. In a blink of an eye, heaven and earth became one color, and a giant human face could vaguely be seen, half-appearing with a grotesque smile. Killing intent was unleashed without reservation.\n\nBOOM!!!!\nBai Baocu's flying daggers struck Lu Ding's fist, shattering into dust without even making a metallic clang. The heroic spirit in his eyes instantly extinguished. In that moment, all that remained in his eyes was the desperate yearning for life and terror towards the person who had thrown the punch. The punch landed squarely on his chest, its power and spiritual energy entering his body and tearing apart his vitality. The immense force hit directly. It was as if he had been struck by a train locomotive charging at full speed. But Lu Ding's fist was not as large as a locomotive. As is well known, the smaller the area of impact, the greater the pressure. Thus, this punch directly pierced through Bai Baocu's chest, and as the power and spiritual energy dispersed, it directly shattered him into countless pieces, scattering them everywhere. The terrifying power continued unabated, carrying a fierce wind that howled across the hillside, blowing the entire forest into a center part.\n\nBefore death, a realization dawned on Bai Baocu's mind. \"Demonic fiends are indeed terrifying, no wonder 749 cracks down so hard......\"\n\nThis scene stunned everyone. Bai Baocu was... blasted apart!!! This demonic fiend actually killed Bai Baocu!!? Suddenly, someone's gaze flickered and swept across, spotting the 749 shoulder insignia on Lu Ding's shoulder. An overwhelming shock immediately arose in their hearts! Since when did 749 start recruiting such ruthless devils?\n\nLu Ding's gaze gradually turned to disdain. He had thought Bai Baocu was so powerful, to come at him head-on. It made him use fifty percent of his power to throw a punch. Originally, Lu Ding was comfortably drinking tea in his room. However, not long after he went out, Yu Qingli ran back and said that people from the Bai family had attacked. Now Wu Yishuang was engaging them in a fierce battle. Upon hearing this, Lu Ding came to provide support immediately. Still some distance away, when he saw Wu Yishuang sitting on the ground, leaning against a large tree, thirty percent of his power was already in position. Attacking a 749 investigator, causing a 749 investigator to be injured. The prerequisite condition was met; even if the King of Hell himself came today, Bai Baocu wouldn't survive. But who knew, this person not only didn't retreat but dared to charge towards him, making Lu Ding think he had some special trump card. Turns out, that's all there was to it.......\n\nLu Ding floated down from the air. Wu Yishuang looked up at the approaching figure, her mouth slightly agape, her eyes filled with shock. She knew Lu Ding was strong, incredibly strong. But she had completely underestimated just how strong Lu Ding was, beyond her imagination. He blasted Bai Baocu apart with a single punch. The bureau's intelligence... seems... a bit outdated.\n\n\"How are you?\" Lu Ding asked.\nWu Yishuang had intended to say she was fine, but just as the words were about to leave her mouth, she saw that many Bai family members were still watching. She immediately feigned weakness and said, \"Cough, cough... I'm fine, Lu Taisui... not dead yet.\" This single line was simply the perfect touch, fully portraying the image of a fearless 749 investigator.\n\nBai Hemian raised his hand and tossed a medicine bottle over. \"Give her one pill, it can heal injuries, and she'll recover quickly.\" After saying this, Bai Hemian looked at the remaining Bai family members. \"Now, everyone squat down where you are, and put your hands where I can see them. I need to ensure you pose no threat.\"\n\nNot everyone understands common sense. Most people would follow the general situation. But a small portion always believed they would be special exceptions, secretly harboring improper thoughts. For instance, right now, some tried to slip away amidst the chaos. But just as they moved, Bai Hemian swiftly surged forward, his hands imbued with spiritual energy, stabbing and tearing, one hand taking half. \"Those who do not comply, die!\" This time, no one dared to harbor any other thoughts.\n\nLu Ding uncorked the medicine bottle and poured out a pill for Wu Yishuang. After she took it, her complexion instantly became rosy. Her body, which had been somewhat unable to get up, immediately performed a carp jump. She stood up and gave Bai Hemian a thumbs up. \"Instant cure!\"\n\nLu Ding:.......\nOthers:........\nOnly Bai Hemian listened, deep in thought. \"Is this medicine really that effective?\" He hadn't really known before; he had been in confinement, and Elder Deng had told him this medicine was cheap and effective, good for minor injuries. That's why Bai Hemian had kept it prepared. He hadn't used it himself yet. Lately, he had been on missions with Lu Ding and hadn't been injured for a long time, so of course, he hadn't taken it himself. Besides, Wu Yishuang had just looked like she was 'about to die', Bai Hemian thought. It couldn't be faked!! He had never seen anyone act so realistically! So this must be the most genuine feedback! He secretly affirmed in his heart that he should stock up more in the future. Although it was cheap, it was effective. Lan Mingli, who had been unconscious last time, also woke up after taking this medicine!\n\nNow that Wu Yishuang was also rescued, Lu Ding gestured, \"Take them back.\" He still had a use for these people. Bai Hemian was single-minded, but Lu Ding couldn't be single-minded. Keeping these people would be perfect for probing the Bai family's strength. Lu Ding would assume the role of righteous authority and take them to the Bai family to demand an explanation. Then... wouldn't he be able to see how deep the Bai family's waters ran**?\n\nBai Hemian needed to work hard, but he needed a goal, right? He couldn't pinpoint that goal, so Lu Ding would help him measure it! If they weren't impressive enough, then their past grievances would be settled today. If they suddenly exceeded expectations, then today's cause would lead to future consequences; they could discuss it later. At that time, he'd put on a smile and say, \"I've long heard of the great name of the Bai family's elder, and have admired him for a long time. Seeing him today, his reputation is truly well-deserved. We still need to return to the training ground to submit our mission.\" \"We won't trouble you further this time.\" The main point is that he can advance or retreat.\n\n---\n*   **ascended to heaven in a single step**: An idiom describing a rapid and significant rise in status or power.\n**  **how deep the Bai family's waters ran**: An idiom used to describe the extent of a group's power, influence, or the complexity of a situation.",

    "content": "......\n\nIn front of the construction site.\n\nA group of people knelt upright.\n\nBai Baoquan knelt at the very front.\n\nHe couldn't help but think to himself, \"Forbearance for a moment brings calm, a step back broadens the horizon.\"\n\nThey couldn't go back now.\n\nBrother Baocheng would surely notice the anomaly and come looking for them.\n\nWhen he arrived, the situation would instantly reverse.\n\nAlthough they couldn't do anything excessive to that young man from 749, they could resolve their current humiliation.\n\nThey could slowly take revenge later!\n\nThinking this, Bai Baoquan knelt even more perfectly, determined not to let anyone find fault with him.\n\nThis was merely a temporary humiliation.\n\n\"Victory and defeat are common for strategists!\"\n\n\"Life is long, we'll see!\"\n\nAs he pondered, he heard the sound of dense footsteps approaching.\n\nCuriosity welled up, but Bai Baoquan restrained the urge to turn his head and look.\n\nDetails often determined success or failure.\n\nHe absolutely couldn't be distracted by external factors; even if Brother Baocheng arrived, he couldn't stand up immediately.\n\nUnless Brother Baocheng could overpower that person!\n\nSuddenly, a hand reached out and patted his shoulder.\n\n\"Good, you're kneeling the most perfectly.\"\n\nLu Ding said, looking at the captives Bai Hemian had brought back behind him.\n\n\"You all learn from him and kneel like him. Anyone who moves, bears the consequences themselves!\"\n\nBai Hemian's heart stirred upon hearing this, and he actively raised his hand to volunteer: \"I'll be responsible for supervising them!\"\n\nBai Baoquan's curiosity grew even stronger. Who had arrived?\n\nWhy would someone else need to kneel with him?\n\nBut he didn't dare look back. If he moved, he'd be giving them a handle, and they could kill him, and he'd have no say. He didn't even dare to blink.\n\nAs for the others, they followed Lu Ding's words without a sound.\n\nThey were as obedient as if they'd undergone military training.\n\nDon't ask why. If you ask, it's because when they walked out of the forest, there were over thirty, almost forty people, but now, only thirty had arrived here.\n\nAs for where the others went, don't ask, don't mind.\n\nSoon, dozens of people knelt neatly and silently. Bai Hemian paced beside them, watching intently.\n\nHis main principle was: I can ignore your small movements countless times, but you absolutely must not let me catch you even once.\n\nThis made everyone's backs tingle.\n\nLooking at their former kin so close by, they were speechless; silence here was more eloquent than words.\n\nNext to the wooden house that Wu Yishuang had built, a bonfire blazed.\n\nThe cleaned wild chicken and rabbit, seasoned with base flavors and wrapped in unknown large leaves, were simply thrown into the fire to roast.\n\nLu Ding sat down beside the bonfire, feeling its warmth.\n\nHe heard Cao Ying say, \"Brother Lu, what are you planning to do next? Bai Baocheng's death probably can't be kept a secret.\"\n\n\"The Bai family here is powerful, and our home ground is in Yunhai; we can't control things here.\"\n\nHe was also worried about Lu Ding.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"An open spear is easy to dodge, but a hidden arrow is hard to guard against.\"\n\nBut the current situation was the opposite.\n\nHidden arrows, 749 wouldn't allow, but open spears were hard to judge.\n\nCao Ying knew Lu Ding was strong, but this was, after all, their territory. If members of the Bai family kept coming to challenge Lu Ding one after another, no matter how strong a person was, they couldn't endure relay attacks.\n\nNot seeking revenge, not causing trouble, just openly challenging him—that's not illegal, right?\n\nOf course, there was a solution to this: just not respond, right?\n\nThat was indeed the case.\n\nBut Cao Ying knew Lu Ding's temperament and personality; not responding was impossible.\n\nMoreover, here, Lu Ding had no one he was close to who could assist him. It was practically just him and Bai Hemian who had to withstand the pressure from all the young generation of the Bai family.\n\nAs for Cao Ying... he knew his limits.\n\nHe couldn't be of much significant help.\n\nAnd if he did help, the problem might even become more complicated.\n\nLu Ding understood his meaning.\n\nThe bright firelight shone on his face, his nearly perfect profile clearly visible.\n\nLu Ding's lips curved into a slight smile.\n\n\"It's best if they come to me. If they don't, I'll go to them.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me. I know you want to say that 'even a fierce tiger can't stand against a pack of wolves.'\"\n\n\"But I might be slightly stronger than you imagine and estimate right now.\"\n\nLu Ding said, forming a small gap with his thumb and forefinger.\n\n\"Brother Lu, a 'little bit' isn't enough. There are many of them. How about...\"\n\nLu Ding's hand gesture remained.\n\n\"How about you take another look.\"\n\nCao Ying was puzzled. He leaned his head forward, his eyes slightly narrowed.\n\nWhen he clearly saw the roughly constructed mountains and rivers made of spiritual energy between Lu Ding's fingers, Cao Ying instantly laughed in exasperation.\n\n\"I'm really impressed, Brother Lu. So, this is your 'little bit,' huh?\"\n\nHe realized that Lu Ding's humor cells had taken the high ground again.\n\nHowever, Lu Ding's punch earlier was indeed very powerful.\n\nCao Ying had thought that might have been Lu Ding's full power.\n\nBut now, he asked curiously, \"Brother Lu, how much strength did you use in that punch just now?\"\n\nLu Ding answered truthfully, \"Roughly five-tenths of my usual state.\"\n\n*Snap!*\n\nYu Qingli, listening nearby, felt a surge of excitement and snapped the wooden stick she was using to poke the fire.\n\nBut her face remained nonchalant.\n\nCao Ying withdrew his gaze.\n\nThe shock in his heart slowly subsided.\n\nHe had thought he was already numb.\n\nEven after seeing Lu Ding's terrifying punch, he hadn't shown too much surprise.\n\nBecause Lu Ding should be like that.\n\nBut now he was being told that it was only five-tenths of his usual state...\n\nCao Ying didn't dare to imagine how terrifying Lu Ding would be if he used ten-tenths of his strength.\n\nHe also didn't dare to imagine Lu Ding's combat power in an unusual state.\n\nThis was simply terrifying, making one's scalp tingle.\n\nHis strength was increasing at a terrifyingly fast pace, like flying.\n\nAlright then.\n\nMy worries were superfluous. He thought he was on the first floor and Lu Ding on the fifth.\n\nBut now he was being told that Lu Ding was actually on the tenth floor.\n\nAnd it was because he was tired of flying in the stratosphere, it was boring and tasteless up there, so he came down to have some fun.\n\n\"Sigh...\"\n\nCao Ying sighed, silently pulled out his phone, looked at it, and said, \"Brother Lu, Wang Qingge is almost here. I'll go pick her up first; she can't find the exact location.\"\n\nLu Ding asked casually, \"That fast?\"\n\nCao Ying replied offhandedly, \"She can fold origami airplanes, and you can ride those. She also controls insect clouds to carry her, and she can use wind escape...\"\n\n\"Strange abilities... you really can do everything, huh...\"\n\nWithout thinking much, Lu Ding said, \"Then you hurry and go—\"\n\nHis words suddenly stopped there.\n\nCao Ying looked at him, puzzled as to why he suddenly fell silent.\n\nHe saw Lu Ding stand up.\n\nChanging his words: \"I'll go pick her up with you.\"\n\nWith Bai Hemian here, nothing could go wrong.\n\nLu Ding was idle here anyway.\n\nMight as well go together.\n\nTo avoid any accidents with Cao Ying on the way.\n\nThough not necessarily, it was safer to be cautious.\n\nThe phrase \"hurry back\" was like setting a jinx*; it was unlucky.\n\nBesides, Lu Ding wasn't a turtle; saving this little bit of time by staying still was pointless.\n\nCao Ying didn't refuse.\n\nBecause he already had a guess about Lu Ding's fate in his heart. Although he had never seen Lu Ding's Eight Characters of Birth, judging from past and present events, Lu Ding's fate had a bit of something about it that was different from ordinary people; wherever he was, something was bound to happen.\n***\n*   **setting a jinx:** A modern internet slang term (立flag, lì flag) meaning to make a statement or boast that inadvertently causes the opposite outcome to happen, similar to tempting fate or jinxing oneself.",

    "content": "......\n\nMoreover, these matters were all inextricably linked to him; often, it wasn't Lu Ding looking for trouble, but rather, trouble found Lu Ding.\n\nThe two departed together, following Wang Qingge's shared location.\n\nThey left Bai Hemian, Wu Yishuang, and Yu Qingli to guard this place.\n\nIn the dense forest.\n\nThe two journeyed onward.\n\nCao Ying watched the red dot on his phone appear and disappear. He couldn't help but complain, \"While the age of technology is convenient, this darn thing's signal is too unstable.\"\n\nLu Ding asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Wang Qingge's location is appearing and disappearing. She's probably reached Red Cliff Rock. The magnetic field there is quite chaotic, and the high mineral content affects phone signals.\"\n\n\"However, the phones supplied by your bureau won't be affected, Brother Lu.\"\n\nMilitary-grade equipment isn't in the same league as civilian-grade, and the equipment used by 749 isn't in the same league as military-grade.\n\nLu Ding responded, \"It's fine. As long as we know she's there, we'll go find her.\"\n\nHearing this, Cao Ying watched the red dot on his phone disappear. He quickly zoomed in on the map. Seeing that Wang Qingge's last known location was a cliff on the map, Cao Ying's expression became helpless.\n\nWhat was it he had just said? It wasn't Lu Ding looking for trouble; it was trouble finding Lu Ding every single time.\n\nHe asked with a helpless tone, \"Brother Lu, you need to calm down in a bit. Don't just act recklessly.\"\n\nLu Ding found these words a bit perplexing. What was that all about? How did that suddenly involve fighting? He didn't speak, but furrowed his brow, letting his gaze convey his thoughts.\n\nLu Ding: So?\n\nCao Ying explained to him.\n\n\"Here, there are two types of natural disasters that must be avoided. One is black sandstorms, which are most likely to occur in summer.\"\n\n\"The other is whiteout blizzards*, which only appear in winter.\"\n\n\"Neither can be resisted by human power.\"\n\n\"I've heard that planting trees in the Northwest is primarily to resist black sandstorms, and then ordinary wind and sand. But how ordinary trees can withstand black sandstorms that even Qi practitioners need to avoid, I wouldn't know.\"\n\n\"After all, that's just what I've heard.\"\n\nLu Ding had also heard of these two things, black sandstorms and whiteout blizzards, but not extensively. In any case, they were formidable natural disasters. He hadn't seen how formidable they were specifically, so he wouldn't comment. He gestured for Cao Ying to continue.\n\n\"But in certain places, whether due to unique natural geographical locations or some other reason, black sandstorms and whiteout blizzards don't blow. If encountered, one can take shelter in these places.\"\n\nAt this, Cao Ying raised his phone and zoomed in on the map.\n\n\"The place where Wang Qingge just disappeared is one such location.\"\n\nCao Ying pointed to the spot on the map: \"Here, there's a black inn*. In the past, it served as a shelter for travelers caught in natural disasters.\"\n\n\"Later, after the Han government planted trees and afforested this area, black sandstorms gradually ceased in this region.\"\n\n\"So this black inn gradually lost its primary purpose.\"\n\n\"Later, the black inn relied on the connections it had accumulated over the years and started a unique business in this area, providing rest, lodging, and food for passing Qi practitioners.\"\n\n\"But being a black inn, ordinary Qi practitioners generally wouldn't go there; only those with dirty hands would.\"\n\n\"You just provoked the Bai family. If you go to that black inn later and can't control yourself, neither the underworld nor the legitimate powers here will tolerate you.\"\n\n\"These people are all connected, like pulling up a radish brings up the surrounding mud*. One incident could involve a large number of them. If that happens, you'll be public enemy number one here.\"\n\n\"Besides, you're an official. Not all of them inside, but ninety-nine out of a hundred are connected to bandits.\"\n\n\"Or rather, they are bandits. Their identities are sensitive, and they can't stand 749.\"\n\n\"So my point is, in a bit, you should wait outside for me. I'll go in and bring her out.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Brother Lu?\"\n\nLu Ding didn't care either way, but since Cao Ying had put it that way, and it's better to avoid trouble than to stir it up—knowing that going in might cause trouble, and someone might say something nasty—wouldn't it be better for him not to go in?\n\nHe nodded in agreement: \"Alright, I'll wait for you outside.\"\n\nThe two quickened their pace. Soon they arrived at the place Cao Ying had described.\n\nAt the base of Red Cliff Rock.\n\nThere stood an ancient-style building, constructed against the cliff.\n\nOn the plaque above the door, two large characters were written, simple, easy to understand, and devoid of any artistic flair:\n\nBlack Inn.\n\nIt was that simple and direct. Lu Ding had initially thought that Cao Ying's \"black inn\" was an adjective, describing a place with exorbitant prices, or perhaps where people were killed for their goods. But as it turned out... its name was actually Black Inn.\n\nLu Ding was a little speechless. Whoever named this place was a genius. With just these two characters on the plaque, what decent person would dare to enter? It blatantly tells you it's a black inn, precisely screening clients and preventing good people from entering.\n\nCao Ying warned him, \"Brother Lu, just wait for me here. I'll be right out. Absolutely do not go inside casually.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, don't worry. I won't go in. If anything happens, just text me.\"\n\nCao Ying nodded and quickly walked forward. Lu Ding's gaze followed, watching him ascend the steps in a few strides and push open the door.\n\nThe visible part of the building from the outside was only a small portion of the Black Inn. Stepping inside, one would discover that... in fact, most of the mountain base had been hollowed out. Inside, the view was expansive, and the space was vast. Only the facilities were old. The sounds of chattering people, surging heat, and the mixed aromas of various meats, vegetables, and alcohol assaulted his senses.\n\nThere were only two floors in total. The ground floor was a large hall, filled with tables and benches, serving as a dining area. The upper floor was for lodging, with densely packed room doors closely connected.\n\nAs soon as Cao Ying entered, a reception attendant with an enthusiastic demeanor approached him. \"Oh, isn't this Master Cao? What brings you here today?\"\n\nAs soon as these words were uttered, many in the room turned their gaze towards him. They repeatedly clasped their hands in salute towards Cao Ying, calling him either \"Steward Cao\" or \"Master Cao.\"\n\nIn Yunhai, Cao Ying was influential; here, he was even more so. After all, he had made his ruthless name by \"holding treasures and roaming the mountains*.\"\n\nCao Ying returned each greeting, his gaze sweeping the room. After not spotting Wang Qingge, he inquired, \"Did a Daoist nun come in just now?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"She's over in that corner.\"\n\nThe reception attendant pointed to a blind spot that couldn't be seen from their current position.\n\nHearing this, Cao Ying felt a little relieved. He lowered his voice and continued to ask, \"What tea and dishes did she order?\"\n\nThe attendant's smile didn't fade. He was also a clever person who knew how to read the situation. He immediately lowered his head, reducing his voice as he replied, \"Don't worry, it was the red menu*, plain tea. Things aren't like before; we wouldn't dare mess around. The boss has also instructed us to change our business model.\"\n\nCao Ying nodded in satisfaction, pulled a roll of money from his pocket, and slipped it to the reception attendant.\n\n\"You'd best not dare to mess around.\"\n\nThe reception attendant just smiled, saying nothing, but his hand reached for the money. Cao Ying patted his shoulder and walked further inside, clasping his hands in salute to those he passed.\n\n---\n*   **Whiteout blizzards**: \"白毛風\" (bái máo fēng) literally means \"white-hair wind,\" referring to a severe winter storm, typically a blizzard with strong winds and heavy snow that causes zero visibility.\n*   **Black Inn**: \"黑店\" (hēidiàn) literally means \"black shop\" or \"dark shop,\" referring to an inn or establishment that swindles or robs its customers, often with sinister intentions. Here, it is also the establishment's literal name, implying a self-identified nature.\n*   **Like pulling up a radish brings up the surrounding mud**: \"拔出蘿蔔帶著泥\" (bá chū luóbo dài zhe ní) is a Chinese idiom describing a situation where a single incident or person is connected to many others, revealing a larger, often entangled, network.

    "content": "......\n\nIn the corner.\n\nWang Qingge, clad in a Daoist robe, seemed somewhat out of place with her surroundings.\n\nFrom the moment she entered, people kept casting glances her way.\n\nWhispers continuously filled the air.\n\n“This girl probably isn't a Daoist successor; she might just be wearing a Daoist robe.”\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“Are you stupid? Look at what she's eating—that's beef!”\n\n“Daoists have four forbidden foods: dog meat, beef, wild geese, and snakehead fish.”\n\n“Dogs are loyal; they can sacrifice their lives for their master.”\n\n“Cattle are industrious. In the past, productivity was low, and main labor relied on cattle. Moreover, ancient laws prohibited eating beef, so Daoists have maintained this custom to this day.”\n\n“Wild geese are faithful. Once one's partner dies, the remaining goose will live out its days alone.”\n\n“Snakehead fish are filial. After spawning, snakehead fish stop eating and guard their young. At this time, the small fish will voluntarily swim into the female fish's mouth to sacrifice themselves to feed their mother, which is why Daoists do not eat snakehead fish.”\n\n“But even though this girl is wearing Daoist clothes, she eats beef, so it’s highly probable she’s just wearing the clothes.”\n\n“And her clothes are a bit big, ill-fitting, so it’s unlikely she’s a real Daoist priestess.”\n\nHearing their companion say this.\n\nThe others had an idea.\n\nSomeone joked, “Well, if that’s the case, since she ate beef, can she also drink alcohol?”\n\n“Why don’t one of you go ask her?”\n\n“Forget it, forget it. Don’t drink some horse urine* and go provoke others. In the jianghu, there are taboos: old people, children, monks, Daoist priests, and women.”\n\n“They all look like vulnerable groups, but if these people dare to roam the jianghu, then each and every one of them has some real skill.”\n\n“This girl alone ticks two boxes: she’s a Daoist priestess and a woman, so she’s definitely not to be trifled with.”\n\n“You go rest on the side. We’re already in a black inn; it’s not like anyone here is easy to deal with. What’s wrong with having a drink?”\n\nSometimes, with some people, they just won't listen if you speak to them nicely.\n\nYou tell them drinking and causing trouble will land them in jail.\n\nDo they know?\n\nOf course they know, but they just get arrogant after a bit of horse urine*.\n\nIf a two-meter tall brute stands there, he’s guaranteed to be docile.\n\nBut if you swap that for someone similar to him, or a girl, child, or old person nearby.\n\nHe’s guaranteed to yell louder than anyone, but once he’s in the station and things get serious, he’ll chicken out before anyone else.\n\nTo put it plainly, he bullies the weak and fears the strong.\n\nBut often, in a group, the person who first proposes an idea is the last to act; they’ll instigate others to go first.\n\nSure enough.\n\nThe person who first made the suggestion nudged the shoulder of the person next to him.\n\n“Heizi, why don’t you go call her over for a drink?”\n\n“I’ll go then.”\n\nHeizi stood up, swayed unsteadily with his drink, and approached Wang Qingge’s table.\n\n“Daoist Priestess, would you like to have a drink with us?”\n\nWang Qingge looked up and pulled out a small wooden plaque from her pocket.\n\nSpiritual energy gathered, and words appeared on it.\n\n【What did you say?】\n\nHeizi pursed his lips and turned to look at his companions.\n\n“So she’s a mute.”\n\nAs soon as he said this.\n\nWang Qingge very seriously raised the plaque again.\n\n【I am a Daoist priestess, not a lama】\n\nHeizi’s face twisted upon seeing this.\n\n“I fucking said you’re a mute! Who said you’re a lama?! Is your mouth not working, and your ears not working either?!!!”\n\nAlthough she couldn’t hear what the person was saying clearly.\n\nBut first looking at his expression, then his lip movements.\n\nWang Qingge didn’t discern anything else, only caught a ‘fucking’.\n\n【You dare curse at me!!】\n\nShe immediately acted, swinging the wooden plaque in her hand at the person's head.\n\nBang!!!!\n\nHeizi was instantly sent flying, and his head was caved in by that wooden plaque.\n\nHonestly, this thing’s quality was pretty good.\n\nThe person who was hit had their head ruined, but the wooden plaque was still intact.\n\nThe few people nearby saw their companion getting hit and immediately cursed, stood up, and were about to make a move.\n\nIt was also at this moment.\n\nCao Ying arrived.\n\nHe quickly stepped in front of the few people.\n\n“Aren’t these the brothers from Yangchang Road?”\n\nAs he said this, Cao Ying’s eyes darted left and right, seeing people standing up all around.\n\nThere were quite a few people from Yangchang Road.\n\nHe took a step back, quietly pulled out his phone, and opened the chat window.\n\n【It’s started】\n\nHis finger rested on the send button, ready to see what these people would do.\n\nIf they were going to fight, he would send it. If they could talk it out, Cao Ying would absolutely not involve Lu Ding.\n\nNow seeing him blocking in the middle.\n\nThe people from Yangchang Road temporarily held back from acting.\n\nScarface, the leader, cupped his hand and said, “Boss Cao, what is the meaning of this?”\n\nCao Ying greeted them with a smile.\n\n“No other meaning. She’s someone I called to help out with the business. If there’s any offense, please give me a way out, and I’ll leave quickly.”\n\nCao Ying now was not like before; he certainly wasn't short on money.\n\nProblems that can be solved with money are not problems.\n\nScarface twisted his neck, making cracking sounds.\n\n“I know you, Boss Cao, are rich now, but today’s matter isn't something money can solve.”\n\nAs he spoke, someone helped over Heizi, who had been hit earlier.\n\nScarface twisted Heizi’s caved-in face, showing the injured area to Cao Ying.\n\n“Look here, in front of so many people, my brother was beaten like this. If we take your money today, we’re afraid we’ll have no face to come back to this black inn again.”\n\nCao Ying understood.\n\nThey wanted Wang Qingge to give an explanation.\n\nHe had called her over for help; she came properly, and she must leave properly.\n\nThese were jianghu rules.\n\nBut right now, these people didn’t want Wang Qingge to leave properly.\n\nThen don’t blame him.\n\nCao Ying’s finger moved, and he stalling with a forced smile: “Don’t be like that, why don’t you think about it again, think clearly, and give me some face.”\n\nAt this point, someone who enjoyed watching the commotion but didn’t mind making it worse spoke up.\n\nHe egged them on from the side.\n\n“You’re all fucking rice-eaters*! What’s the use of so much money? Life and death are seen lightly, if you’re not convinced, just fight!!”\n\nThis remark greatly pleased Scarface.\n\nThree parts of respect faded from his face: “To put it bluntly, I gave you three points of face by calling you Boss Cao. If I don't give you face, I'll make you.....”\n\nBang!!!\n\nThe black inn’s main door shattered, and everyone instinctively turned their heads to look.\n\nRolling black smoke carrying a foul, bloody wind swirled into the stone hall.\n\nJust as everyone thought some demon or monster had appeared.\n\nThey saw a figure burst out from within, single-handedly seizing the neck of the person who had just egged them on, lifting him up in front.\n\nLu Ding looked at the person in his hand and said in a calm voice, “You eat uncooked rice*? What a coincidence, I eat raw meat.”\n\nAs he spoke, a strike erupted from his hand, and under everyone’s watchful eyes, Lu Ding displayed one of his signature skills.\n\nSoon, only a round object remained in his hand.\n\nLu Ding loosened his grip, and the head rolled across the floor.\n\nImmediately, everyone instinctively looked at the body camera on his chest.\n\nThat thing, only 749 investigators would wear it......\n\nBut......your bizarre entrance......your ruthless methods......you’re a 749 investigator?!!!\n\nYou’ve got to be kidding me!!\n\nYou must be faking it.\n\nIf you said you were some ferocious bandit, madman, demonic cultist, or monstrous spirit of a thousand years, I could believe that.\n\nBut you say such a person is a 749 investigator, then I’d have to ponder that.\n\nLu Ding stood in mid-air, scanning the entire hall with an arrogant, condescending posture.\n\nHe looked down on everyone equally, seeing no one as worthy.\n\nThe disdain evident in his eyes deeply stung everyone except Cao Ying and Wang Qingge.\n\nThat feeling was as if someone was pointing a gun at their heads and calling them trash.\n\nEven if they had a thousand furies and ten thousand dissatisfactions, they dared not show it.\n\nThey could only lower their heads, heads lowering in swathes, not daring to meet Lu Ding’s gaze.\n\nBecause his manner of appearance and ruthless methods had already thoroughly intimidated everyone.\n\nThis was a handgun that dared to be cocked and fired at their heads at any moment.\n\nNo one dared to gamble their lives on whether a ruthless demonic cultivator madman would be moody and unpredictable.\n\nAnyway, they wouldn’t believe that Lu Ding could be a 749 investigator.\n\nFinally, Lu Ding’s gaze swept around and landed on Scarface.\n\nThis made Scarface's heart inexplicably skip a beat.\n\nBefore he even made a move, the inexplicable oppressive feeling had already made him sweat profusely.\n\n“Finish what you just didn’t finish saying. I want to hear it.”\n___\n*Lit. \"horse urine,\" an idiom for cheap or bad alcohol.\n*Lit. \"people who eat uncooked rice,\" an idiom referring to tough, reckless, or crude individuals.",

I'll cover it.\"\n\nLu Ding wasn't an unreasonable person either.\n\nHe'd acted violently in someone else's establishment, not only smashing things but also dirtying the place.\n\nThis was something that should be compensated for.\n\nCan't bully people.\n\nNo sooner had he finished speaking than the server poked his head out from a corner.\n\nHis face a little pale, he said, \"Our... our boss said there's no need for you to compensate.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nAfter Lu Ding thanked him, he pulled out his phone, scrolling, and walked out with Cao Ying and Wang Qingge.\n\nNot until they were out the main door...\n\n...did he say to Cao Ying, \"I've transferred five hundred thousand to you; help me give it to the owner.\"\n\n\"You don't need that much, Brother Lu.\"\n\n\"Transferring a hundred thousand yuan would be enough.\"\n\nAnyway, in Cao Ying's eyes, this rundown place could be bought again for five hundred thousand.\n\nLu Ding didn't even tear the place down; it didn't need that much.\n\n\"I just casually glanced at the menu they had on the wall; nothing there was cheap, and with the commotion I caused today, it's very likely to affect their future business.\"\n\n\"When you add it all up, five hundred thousand isn't actually much, and for me, it's not a lot either.\"\n\nJust now, while Lu Ding was acting, he casually glanced at the menu on the wall.\n\nThe dishes on it, even the cheapest ones were several hundred yuan, and there were only a few kinds.\n\nThe others easily cost thousands, even tens of thousands.\n\nCompensation, you have to base it on the actual situation.\n\nCao Ying nodded, \"Brother Lu, you are truly principled!\"\n\nLu Ding laughed in response, \"Cut it out.\"\n\nThen he looked at Wang Qingge, who was wearing a Daoist robe.\n\nHow to put it, Lu Ding's first impression of her was quite good.\n\nAnd she had come to help too.\n\nPeople should understand politeness; those who help shouldn't be neglected.\n\nSo, Lu Ding took the initiative to greet her, introducing himself: \"Hello, my name is Lu Ding, I'm a 749 Investigator.\"\n\nThe words had barely left his mouth...\n\n...when Lu Ding belatedly remembered what Cao Ying had told him earlier: that this girl was a little hard of hearing and easily misheard things.\n\nHe was just about to form characters with Spiritual Qi...\n\n...when he saw an expression of incredible surprise appear on Wang Qingge's face.\n\nShe excitedly raised the wooden plaque in her hand.\n\n[What did you just say!!! Can you say it again!!?]\n\nLu Ding wondered, \"Did this girl mishear what I said?\"\n\nHe raised his hand and used Spiritual Qi to form the words he had just spoken, making them appear.\n\nAfter Wang Qingge clearly saw them,\n\nShe excitedly bounced repeatedly in place, holding her plaque.\n\n[That's right, it's this, it's this! I can hear you speak, I can actually hear you speak!!]\n\n[Ahhhhhhhhhh........]\n\nCao Ying was also stunned.\n\nHe interjected and asked, \"Then can you hear me speak?\"\n\nWang Qingge stopped moving and raised her plaque.\n\n[What gibberish are you talking about? Don't understand, type it out.]",

    "content": ".....\n\nCao Ying didn't need to type anymore.\nHe already understood in his heart.\n\n“Brother Lu, it seems she can only understand what you say. Do you want to try again?”\n“She’s never understood anyone else before.”\n\nLu Ding was also a little curious. He clearly remembered that he hadn't obtained any spells related to this. How could she understand what he was saying?\n\nHe tried saying, “If you can understand me, nod your head.”\n\nWang Qingge nodded more than a dozen times in a row. Then she held up a sign.\n【I really can understand!!! Why!!! Why can I understand you?! Do you possess some special secret art?】\n\nThis question stumped Lu Ding.\n“I really don’t know this. I’m also curious why you can only understand me.”\n\nCao Ying stood nearby. Suddenly, he heard indistinct mumbling close to his ear. As he listened, he felt his temples throbbing. Cao Ying took a few steps back. He knew this meant the foul entity on Wang Qingge was acting up again.\n\n“Brother Lu, did you hear the sound coming from her?”\n\nLu Ding slightly tilted his head and pricked up his ears. His expression gradually turned serious, his brow slowly furrowing.\n\nAt this moment, Wang Qingge stopped breathing.\nAfter a long while, Lu Ding shook his head: “No.”\n\nThis bizarre situation made Cao Ying scratch his head in perplexity.\n“Why is that? She understands what you say, but you can’t hear the strange sounds from her.”\n\nHe couldn't figure it out; Cao Ying truly couldn't figure it out. Seeing his bewildered expression, Lu Ding said, “Forget it, don’t think about it. Let’s go back first. We can study it slowly when we get to the construction site.”\n\nCao Ying nodded, but he was still a little unwilling. He raised his hand, and words appeared.\n【Did you hear what Brother Lu just said?】\n\nWang Qingge held up a sign.\n【Can’t understand. It seems I can only understand what he specifically says *to me*】\n\nSeeing this, Cao Ying's confusion deepened.\n\nThe three of them sped forward. The moon climbed the branches, silver light falling, elongating the shadows behind the three.\n\nWang Qingge’s shadow strangely sprouted countless grotesque tentacles, which subtly extended towards Lu Ding’s shadow. But as soon as they made contact, they sharply recoiled, as if they had touched something untouchable.\n\nLu Ding looked over, a feeling in his heart. Yet he didn't find anything abnormal.\nStrange......\n\nAlthough he didn't see anything, Lu Ding believed that he wouldn't get such a feeling for no reason. Every detail is key to success or failure. So... there must be a problem!!\n\nHe analyzed in his mind while continuing on their way. They had just walked through this forest once, so it was possible, but the likelihood wasn't very high.\nCao Ying.....\nIt should be impossible. It wasn't his first time interacting with him. While not entirely impossible, it was the least likely!\nWang Qingge.....\nMost likely!!\n\nThinking of this, Lu Ding kept a closer eye out. He silently continued on their way.\n\nAbout ten minutes later.\nIn the dense forest.\nWang Qingge's shadow again sprouted strange tentacles, trying to touch Lu Ding's shadow.\n\nThis time.\nLu Ding, who had been vigilant, caught it red-handed. Without even turning around, his Jin Che Zhi Dao launched with zero-frame startup, slashing through the air.\n\nThe strange tentacles growing from Wang Qingge's shadow retreated extremely quickly. But ultimately, they were a step too slow.\nCRACK!!!!\n\nA deep mark was left on the ground. This sound also made Wang Qingge and Cao Ying turn to look. Next to the slash mark, a section of black tentacle writhed and wiggled incessantly on the ground, emitting waves that were indescribable and inexplicable.\n\nLu Ding looked at it; he was fine.\nWang Qingge looked at it; she was confused.\nCao Ying looked at it: “AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!” His eyes instantly became bloodshot, and his entire body convulsed uncontrollably.\n\nThis sudden scream made Lu Ding instinctively slap him.\nSMACK!!!\nCao Ying’s eyes instantly cleared. His legs gave way, and he knelt on the ground.\n“Ugh~~~~ Ugh~ Ugh~ Ugh.......”\nSounds of retching accompanied by large mouthfuls of black liquid gushing from Cao Ying’s mouth.\n\nLu Ding hurried over to pat his back. “What’s wrong with you?” “Are you possessed?”\n\nWang Qingge held up a sign.\n【You're throwing up black liquid. Don’t stuff just anything into your mouth. Don’t eat things you shouldn’t】\n\n“No... I just took a glance at @%￥*, and I couldn’t help but vomit.......”\n“A glance at what?” Speaking gibberish, Lu Ding didn’t quite understand.\n“It’s the #@*&@* on the ground, ugh~~~~~~~~~” Cao Ying pointed at the tentacle on the ground. As he spoke, blood vessels reappeared in his eyes, and his body began to convulse. His mouth: “AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!”\n\nLu Ding didn't hesitate for a second, going up and slapping him again.\nSMACK!!!\nCao Ying became clear-headed again, trembled, and quickly turned away.\n“Brother Lu, you can’t look at this thing, you can’t speak of it. If you look or speak of it, you’ll fall prey to it. You can’t even *think* of it!!”\n\nLu Ding turned his head to glance at the still-writhing tentacle on the ground.\nCannot speak, cannot look, cannot think......\nIsn’t that: indescribable, unobservable, undefinable?\nMoreover, tentacles, black, writhing. Coupled with the occasional mumbling that drives people mad.\nNo way? Cthulhu has invaded!!!?\n\nLu Ding felt like he also couldn't quite understand anymore. Yet it also seemed like everything could be explained. He glanced at Wang Qingge. Hard of hearing, bad memory. The Eldritch God tries to transmit corrupted knowledge to you, but you have a bad memory and forget it? So you're unaffected..... The Eldritch God's mumbling wants to drag you into depravity, but you're hard of hearing and can't hear it? So you're unaffected....... You can't be targeted, you!!!\n\nLu Ding was stunned. No wonder Cao Ying said Wang Qingge could do anything.\nYou, this..... You want all the Eldritch God's benefits, but you can't fulfill the Eldritch God's demands..... This is even more \"non-stick\"¹ than Lu Ding. To Lu Ding’s knowledge, the last person to be this \"non-stick\" was Marshal Zhang in his previous life. When he ran out of money, he'd borrow from the Japanese². After borrowing money to buy guns and cannons, he'd use them to fight the Japanese. All his life, he only knew how to write 'Approve' and 'Read'. When signing promissory notes, he’d only write 'Read,' meaning he’d seen it, but wouldn’t write 'Approve,' because he wouldn’t pay it back. Later, he even fooled the Japanese, leaving them dumbfounded, promising things he couldn’t do, but refusing to promise things he could. Now, the more Lu Ding looked at Wang Qingge, the more he felt she should be surnamed Zhang.\n\nBut......\nWhy was he unaffected?\n\nLu Ding glanced again at the writhing tentacle on the ground. He noticed its struggles gradually weakened until it stopped struggling altogether, finally dissolving into the ground.\n\nThen......\n【Contain Monster: Tentacle of 'It' (1/10)】\n【Containment Reward: Eye of Direct Gaze upon full containment】\n【Eye of Direct Gaze: Contaminate, Deprave, Look at me directly】\n\n---\n¹ \"Non-stick\" (不粘鍋, *bù zhān guō*): Literally \"non-stick pan.\" Idiomatically used to describe someone who is unaffected by problems or who evades responsibility, much like food doesn't stick to a non-stick pan.\n² \"The Japanese\" (小日子, *xiǎo rì zi*): A derogatory and informal term for Japanese people. The character Marshal Zhang (Zhang Zuolin) was known for his complex and often confrontational dealings with the Japanese during the Warlord Era in China.",

    "content": "......\n\nThis thing can be contained too?\n\nThen......\n\nLu Ding looked at Wang Qingge. This was just a monster spawner.\n\nThe Eye of Direct Sight. Looking at its description, the words were few, the description brief, yet the content was grand and profound.\n\nThe last thing like this was called the Way of the Catty Cart.\n\nIt had been useful to Lu Ding from his weak beginnings until now, never becoming obsolete.\n\nIt had even created a miracle just now, cutting off even the tentacles of a Cthulhu monster.\n\nTruly, there was nothing it couldn't cut.\n\nLu Ding was quite looking forward to this Eye of Direct Sight.\n\nBut the problem still remained.\n\nWhy wasn't Lu Ding affected?\n\nWas it because of his Golden Finger?\n\nBut the Golden Finger was just a dead thing; he hadn't seen it do anything before.\n\nOr was it because of his skills?\n\nBut among his skills, the ones with the highest limits so far were the Way of the Catty Cart, and the Essence of Forgetfulness, which was the switch for Unity of Heaven and Man.\n\nThough he had never turned it off.......\n\nSuddenly, Lu Ding seemed to understand.\n\nUnity of Heaven and Man, blessed by the will of Heaven.\n\nThe two should be incompatible.\n\nTherefore, he wouldn't be affected.......\n\nJudging by the situation where his words could be heard by Wang Qingge, but others' words couldn't.\n\nThe attention from the will of Heaven received by Unity of Heaven and Man should be more advanced than whatever was on her body.....\n\nLu Ding's mind whirred, and he actually managed to explain it.\n\nLooking at Wang Qingge's shadow on the ground, the tentacles had just emerged from within it.\n\nLu Ding opened his mouth and asked, \"How do you feel? Is there anything uncomfortable, or anywhere hurting?\"\n\nWang Qingge touched her chin and thought for a moment.\n\nThen she held up a sign.\n\n【No】\n\nIf there was no discomfort, then it shouldn't be affected.\n\nLu Ding asked again, \"Then can you let me chop your shadow again?\"\n\nWang Qingge glanced at her own shadow.\n\nThough she didn't quite understand.\n\nBut she didn't refuse.\n\nShe just held up a sign saying.\n\n【You have to be a little gentler, I'm afraid it might hurt just in case】\n\n\"No problem.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lu Ding flicked out a slash towards Wang Qingge's shadow.\n\nThe result was that nothing happened at all.\n\nThe slash directly hit the ground.\n\nThis situation made Lu Ding ponder.\n\nCould it be that he could only cut it when it manifested?\n\nHe helped the somewhat weak Cao Ying up.\n\nLu Ding decided to be more vigilant in the future, waiting for the next time Wang Qingge's shadow extended tentacles.\n\nHe would then cut them off to test it thoroughly.\n\n\"Brother Lu, don't let me see that thing again. If I see it again, I'll really vomit to death......\"\n\nCao Ying said, covering his eyes. He felt like his intestines were about to be vomited out.\n\nHis originally solid cultivation realm now felt a little unstable.\n\nFortunately, he hadn't looked for long.\n\nAnd fortunately, Lu Ding had slapped him a few times, otherwise, he would definitely suffer qi deviation.\n\n\"It's gone, it's disappeared. Let's go, you should go back and rest well.\"\n\nHearing this, Cao Ying finally lowered the hand covering his eyes.\n\nAt this moment, his cheeks were sunken.\n\nHis face was pale, his eyes lacked vigor, and he walked as if floating.\n\nHe said weakly, \"That's good.....\"\n\nOriginally, he wanted to ask what that thing was.\n\nBut just a slight thought made him feel like vomiting again.\n\nThe words on the tip of his tongue were forcefully held back by Cao Ying.\n\nCouldn't he just not ask!\n\nThe three quickened their steps back to the construction site.\n\nAt this time.\n\nWu Yishuang and Yu Qingli's rabbit and pheasant were already roasted.\n\nSeeing the two return, and with a new face besides.\n\nWu Yishuang quickly prepared an extra set of dining utensils.\n\n\"Lu Taisui, you're back just in time. It's perfectly cooked. You two eat first, I'll go call Investigator Bai.\"\n\nShe left, then returned a moment later.\n\nThis time, Bai Hemian followed behind her.\n\nAfter his gaze lingered on Wang Qingge for a moment.\n\nA strange sixth sense arose in his heart. As for what was strange, he couldn't quite say.\n\nBai Hemian spoke directly without avoiding anyone, \"She's not right.\"\n\nIt was a good thing Wang Qingge couldn't understand.\n\nLu Ding instructed, \"She really is a bit off. You should interact with her less.\"\n\nBai Hemian nodded.\n\nHe then glanced at the somewhat weak Cao Ying.\n\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\nLu Ding didn't hide anything from him and directly told Bai Hemian about the situation just now.\n\nLest he not take it seriously enough.\n\nAfter all, Bai Hemian's situation was different from Cao Ying's.\n\nCao Ying suffering qi deviation could still be saved.\n\nIf Bai Hemian were to suffer qi deviation, he would probably go completely insane!!!\n\nThe consequences would be quite serious.\n\nBai Hemian also understood the seriousness of the matter.\n\nHe secretly made a decision in his heart: Hmm...... it seems it's better not to talk to her in the future.\n\nSuddenly, Lu Ding thought of a problem.\n\nThe strange people around him seemed to be gathering more and more.......\n\nHe scanned around, his gaze finally resting on Wang Qingge.\n\nThe girl immediately held up a sign.\n\n【I can't quite remember why Cao Ying called me over】\n\nWell, she forgot......\n\nLu Ding explained to her, \"There's a Golden Toad Embracing Egg Formation here that we can't solve. He said you could solve it, so he called you over.\"\n\nThe words on Wang Qingge's wooden sign changed.\n\n【Where is it? Can you take me to see the situation?】\n\nLu Ding stood up, \"Let's go, I'll take you now.\"\n\nCao Ying heard this and was about to get up, \"I'll go too.\"\n\n\"Alright, just rest. We don't need you.\"\n\nHearing Lu Ding say this, Cao Ying did indeed feel somewhat weak at the moment.\n\nHe then chuckled, \"I was just being polite, don't take it seriously.\"\n\n\"Get out of here.\"\n\nLu Ding walked out, Wang Qingge following behind him.\n\nThe two made their way to the mountaintop, overlooking the general panorama around Ba'ershan.\n\nWang Qingge took out a geomantic compass from her bag.\n\nThey saw the needle spinning continuously, showing no sign of stopping.\n\nShe held up a sign.\n\n【The geomantic energy is chaotic, and the dragon veins are moving. It must have been startled. Normal methods won't easily catch it; it will run everywhere. You have to fish for it.】\n\nLu Ding found this somewhat curious.\n\n\"Fish? How do you fish for it?\"\n\n【The Golden Toad is greedy for money. The better the coin, the greater its allure. Antique coins are best, ones that have been circulated for many years.】\n\n【Then, find a roll of carpenter's ink line that has been used by an old carpenter for many years, tie the coin to it as bait.】\n\n【Finally, dig a well. Golden Toads like to stay at the bottom of wells. Create its favorite atmosphere, and then simply wait by the tree stump for a rabbit.】¹\n\nSeeing these words, Lu Ding thought to himself.\n\nIndeed, every line of work is like a different world.² There are so many intricacies and methods in this.\n\nHe had certainly learned something.\n\nAntique coins and an old carpenter's ink line......\n\nLu Ding looked at her, \"Do you have these things?\"\n\nWang Qingge rummaged through her dirty little crossbody cloth bag.\n\nShe held up a sign.\n\n【No】\n\n\"It's fine, I can go buy them. You can always buy them with money.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lu Ding opened his phone to check nearby cities.\n\nNot far, just over one hundred to two hundred kilometers.\n\nWang Qingge continued to hold up a sign.\n\n【I saw a group of Qi Refiners kneeling outside the construction site just now. We can have them dig the mountain and open the well. Qi Refiners dig mountains very fast, their efficiency is high, and they dig big and accurate.】\n\nLu Ding suddenly turned his head.\n\nOh!!!\n\nWho said this kid wasn't very smart? She's incredibly smart!\n\n......\n\nMy dears, yesterday while cooking, I accidentally cut my index finger while slicing meat. It hurts a bit, and I've been typing with my pinky finger sticking out like an orchid, so for today, I can only guarantee three chapters.\n\nAfter I wake up and the scab is a bit better, I'll make up for it.\n\nFinally, thanks to ybcccc, my dear, for the Gift King. I'll give you a bonus chapter to make up for it. My apologies, dear readers.\n\n---\n¹ *Wait by the tree stump for a rabbit (守株待兔)*: An idiom from an ancient fable, literally meaning to wait by a tree stump for a rabbit to crash into it and die.

He bared them to cool them off.\n\nWang Qingge held up a sign, puzzled.\n\n【What's wrong? Why are you laughing?】\n\n\"Nothing, I'm naturally cheerful.\"\n\nLu Ding replied casually, then asked, \"Do we need to go down and take a look?\"\n\nAfter all, a clearer picture can only be seen with an on-site inspection.\n\nAt least, that's what Lu Ding thought.\n\nHowever, he underestimated their professionalism.\n\nWang Qingge shook her head.\n\n【No need, I've already understood. I've chosen the well's location; it's right on that hilltop.】\n\nShe raised a finger, pointing to a small hill not far away.\n\nThen held up another sign.\n\nHer hands gestured.\n\n【Dig a ten-meter wide, fifty-meter deep well from the hilltop, and you'll hit water.】\n\nAt this, she pulled out a small abacus from her cross-body cloth bag.\n\n*Clack-clack-clack* went the beads.\n\nAnother wooden sign was raised.\n\n【Based on the Qi Refiners I just saw, considering their cultivation level and the local soil quality here, they could probably dig it out in about four days of working non-stop.】\n\nNon-stop...\n\nEven capitalists would have to learn from you.\n\nThinking of this, Lu Ding suddenly felt his mission was extremely heavy.\n\nHe absolutely had to find a way to suppress whatever was on Wang Qingge.\n\nOtherwise, if what's on her erupted in the future, 996 would become 007.\n\nWorking from midnight to midnight, without a moment's rest, seven days a week.\n\nWouldn't that just ruin them?\n\nLu Ding felt that compared to her, he was still too kind.\n\nIn his mind, her image and Bai Hemian's image overlapped.\n\nOne, an idealistic boss, completely disregarding employee lives...\n\nOne, a stubborn lackey manager, only caring about results, not the process, completely treating employees as less than human.\n\nCao Ying was in logistics, Yan Feifan's mouth could handle business.\n\nGood heavens, the team's complete!\n\n\"Alright then, let's head back first. Tomorrow, we'll go into the city to buy copper coins.\"\n\nThe two returned the way they came.\n\nLu Ding briefly explained the general situation to Bai Hemian and the others.\n\nTomorrow's arrangements were as follows:\n\nWu Yishuang and Yu Qingli would continue to watch the construction site.\n\nBai Hemian would lead people to dig the well tomorrow.\n\nCao Ying wasn't feeling well, so he would assist Bai Hemian as a supervisor.\n\nLu Ding and Wang Qingge would go into the city to buy antique coins and look for an ink line.\n\nClear division of labor.\n\nThe next morning, before dawn.\n\nLu Ding and Wang Qingge set off.\n\nAnd as for Bai Hemian and Cao Ying...\n\n*CRACK!!!*\n\nA whip crack was heard early in the morning.\n\nWaking all the drowsy Bai Family Qi Refiners.\n\nBai Hemian, holding a long whip formed from spiritual energy, shouted, \"Get up and work!\"\n\nAt his command, these people rose one after another.\n\nSome were a little slow to get up.\n\nBai Hemian immediately lashed out with his whip.\n\nWhipping them as he yelled, \"Move faster!\"\n\nHe couldn't have been handier with it.\n\nBai Hemian looked at the spiritual energy long whip in his hand, nodding in satisfaction.\n\nThe weapon Lu Ding recommended was indeed good.\n\nHe'd have to go back and buy a good one for backup in the future.\n\nIt was also at this moment that Bai Baoquan, who had been motionless, finally realized.\n\nSo... those kneeling behind him were all Bai Family Qi Refiners.\n\nAt this moment, he felt an indescribable emotion.\n\nHe spoke softly, asking, \"Ba... Baice-ge?\"\n\nThe others lowered their heads and replied, \"Baice-ge is dead...\"\n\nBai Baoquan suddenly didn't know how to accept this reality.\n\nThe next second, a whoosh sounded.\n\n*CRACK!!*\n\nA searing pain came from Bai Baoquan's back.\n\nBai Hemian: \"No talking among yourselves!\"\n\n...\n\nMeanwhile,\n\nQingshu City, Min'an Street.\n\nInside an ordinary antique shop.\n\nLu Ding and Wang Qingge were picking out antique coins for the \"fishing for a Golden Toad\" technique.\n\nBut accurately speaking, it should be Wang Qingge doing the picking.\n\nBecause Lu Ding didn't understand.\n\nHaving nothing to do, he chatted with the owner.\n\n\"Boss, may I trouble you with a question? Do you know if there are any old carpenters around here?\"\n\nAs Lu Ding spoke, he offered a cigarette.\n\nThe owner took the cigarette with both hands, saying, \"Thank you, thank you.\"\n\nLu Ding flicked his lighter to light it for him.\n\nOwner: *Inhale... Exhale...*\n\n\"Old carpenters...\"\n\nHe mused, \"They're hard to find now. There used to be many, but young people nowadays aren't willing to learn. They just buy finished products online or from furniture stores. Old carpenters...\"\n\n\"Do you want something made?\"\n\nLu Ding spoke casually, \"My family needs a wardrobe. I can't find a style I like online, and the quality isn't good either.\"\n\n\"Things made by a carpenter, those are good quality.\"\n\n\"Old crafts passed down by our ancestors, machines can't compare.\"\n\nWhen you talk about old crafts to an antique shop owner, their conversation instantly opens up.\n\nHe didn't even consider what the man was selling.\n\nThe owner glanced at Lu Ding. \"Oh? Young man, you have good taste! I also agree that machines can't compare to handmade items in these aspects.\"\n\n\"When I got married over twenty years ago, I found someone to make a bed, and it still hasn't broken. It's sturdy and beautiful, and...\"\n\nAs the antique shop owner spoke, he let out an \"Eh.\"\n\n\"I thought of someone! You can go find Carpenter Yang. The bed my wife and I sleep on now was made by him. The quality is undeniable. Twenty years and it's like new, it gets sturdier the more you sleep on it.\"\n\nThere it was!\n\nLu Ding pressed, \"Where can I find him?\"\n\n\"Anhe Village. Just navigate there, and once you arrive, you can ask directly. He's quite famous. I haven't asked him to make anything for me in too long, so I only just remembered when we were talking.\"\n\n\"But I don't know if he's dead yet. If not, he should be seventy this year. He might not be able to work anymore.\"\n\nWhile the two chatted, Wang Qingge had chosen the usable copper coins.\n\nLu Ding paid the money.\n\n\"Thanks, boss.\"\n\n\"You're welcome, come again next time.\"\n\nAs they walked out the door, Wang Qingge held up a sign.\n\n【We have the copper coins. Now we just need the ink line.】\n\n\"I know where to get that. Follow me.\"\n\nThe two called a ride-hailing car and headed towards Anhe Village.\n\nOutside Anhe Village.\n\nChang Hai finally arrived at the location after traveling all night.\n\nLooking at the village before him, he pulled out his phone and sent a message to Bai Baice.\n\n【Young Master Bai, I've just arrived here. Once I retrieve the item, I should be back tonight. Please wait.】\n\nUsing copper coins to fish for a Golden Toad, this wasn't Wang Qingge's unique secret method.\n\nTo be precise, this technique should belong to the Sheep Herders.\n\nAnd Chang Hai was a Sheep Herder.\n\nThe news of the Golden Toad embracing an egg was also something he learned from Crippled Li and then sold to Bai Baice.\n\nLast night, the Bai family members were digging a pit in the gully.\n\nTheir purpose was also to dig a well.\n\nThe reason their chosen location was different from Wang Qingge's was due to different techniques within the same overall skill.\n\nFeng Shui, Feng (wind) is high, Shui (water) flows to the low valleys.\n\nChang Hai and his group chose a spot that stored water and blocked wind, while Wang Qingge chose a point that welcomed wind and flowing water.\n\nBut their goals were the same.\n\nHe was also lucky that he volunteered to go find the ink line last night, which coincidentally made him miss Lu Ding.\n\nBut he might have dodged it for now, he wouldn't avoid it forever.\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding was on his way in a car.\n\nChang Hai looked at the unread message on his phone for a long time.\n\nHe couldn't help but wonder, \"Didn't he see it?\"\n\n\"Never mind, I'll go get the Yang carpenter's ancestral ink line first.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the large jar on Chang Hai's back swayed, and its lid was propped open by a pale hand.\n\nAn eerie child, with white powder on its face and red dots on its cheeks, poked its head out and asked,\n\n\"Dad, you said it's ancestral; will he lend it to us?\"\n\n\"Lend? Heh heh...\"\n\nChang Hai's laugh was chilling.\n\nHis eyes gradually showed ferocity: \"He'll lend it even if he doesn't want to. If he doesn't, we'll take it!\"\n\n\"You old scoundrel, I couldn't beat you ten years ago, but now you're on your last legs, almost dead. I don't believe I still can't beat you!!\"",
