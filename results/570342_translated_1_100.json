    "content": "...\n\nLu Ding. Male, nineteen years old. A transmigrator, bearer of a \"golden finger\" called the Monster Containment Prison, and a freshman in the Geological Exploration Department at Yunhai University.\n\nIt just so happened to be summer break, and since he had nothing better to do, Lu Ding decided to get his internship report done early.\n\nThe university had a rule that every student must complete an internship. You had to find the placement yourself; the more relevant to your major, the better, but it wasn't a big deal if it wasn't. The academic credit was awarded based on the quality of the internship report.\n\nPerfect.\n\nLu Ding was also short on cash. After all, he was a transmigrator—and a transmigrator with a golden finger, at that. Having deceased parents was practically a fundamental rule of the genre.\n\nHe had only been able to attend university thanks to government subsidies, coupled with the scholarships he earned for his good grades.\n\nHe still had to earn his own living expenses.\n\nIn any case, earning money was work, and an internship was work.\n\nHe might as well kill two birds with one stone. The sooner this internship report was turned in, the better.\n\nJust as Lu Ding was wondering what to do with his summer, he happened to see a recruitment ad for a geological surveyor.\n\nIt even said they could provide an official internship certificate.\n\nAnd the salary wasn't bad, either: eight thousand a month for students from prestigious universities.\n\nIf you could bring some \"talent\" to the table, the salary was negotiable.\n\nAs for what this \"talent\" was, it was probably something only students majoring in architecture or geological exploration would know about.\n\nFeng Shui!\n\nThat's right, Feng Shui. In a society ruled by science, one couldn't just openly talk about metaphysics.\n\nBut in industries related to these matters, you had to believe in it at least a little.\n\nAs it happened, Lu Ding knew a thing or two about this stuff.\n\nHe wasn't much of a materialist, either.\n\nHe'd already transmigrated, so what was the point of being a materialist?\n\nBesides, his golden finger was explicitly named the Monster Containment Prison. Wasn't that a clear sign that this world was definitely not as simple as it looked?\n\nIf there were no monsters, what was the point of the golden finger?\n\nSo, from the moment he had transmigrated and gotten his bearings, Lu Ding had begun to dabble in the metaphysical arts.\n\nAnd he had continued to this day.\n\nIt was all so that when he finally found a monster in the future, he wouldn't be caught flat-footed.\n\nHe could go straight for the throat and use the right solution for the problem!\n\nThis was aimed specifically at things like ghosts.\n\nIf you were talking about a flesh-and-blood monster, Lu Ding might have hesitated.\n\nBut when it came to spirits and malevolent ghosts, although Lu Ding had no practical experience, he felt terrifyingly confident.\n\nWhether his methods worked or not, he absolutely wouldn't chicken out.\n\nAnd so, Lu Ding made the call. The person who answered was an uncle with a less-than-standard Mandarin accent.\n\nWhen he heard Lu Ding had \"talent,\" he immediately invited him for an interview.\n\nLu Ding arrived, stated his purpose.\n\nThe project supervisor interviewed him personally.\n\nLu Ding opened with feng shui and geomancy, tomb repair and stele erection, mountain opening and road paving, and ley line taboos, all while quoting classics and citing sources, which left the project supervisor thoroughly impressed.\n\nAs for why he didn't mention reading Bazi charts to tell fortunes...\n\nHe couldn't do that. Although Lu Ding knew how, he didn't mention it.\n\nWhat if they asked him for a demonstration?\n\nThat was something Lu Ding couldn't guarantee. If he got it wrong, where else would he find an internship with such good pay?\n\nJust like that, amidst the project manager's sounds of satisfaction, Lu Ding successfully got the job.\n\nAfter nearly a month of hard work, just as payday was approaching, something happened on the construction site!\n\nThat evening, as work was about to wrap up for the day.\n\nThe workers had dug up a large boulder. A red liquid, just like blood, was seeping out of a crack in its surface.\n\nThe sight terrified the workers on the spot.\n\nWhen Lu Ding got the news, he rushed excitedly to the scene.\n\nThe project manager was also there, surrounded by a thick circle of people, all pointing and muttering at the large boulder.\n\nLu Ding squeezed his way through. The project manager saw him, grabbed him, and asked in a low voice.\n\n\"Lu Ding, you know a lot. Take a look and tell us what this thing is.\"\n\nIt was true that Lu Ding knew a lot, but it was all knowledge from books and ancient texts; he'd never seen anything like this in real life. Besides, ancient records described a whole host of bleeding stones.\n\nChecking them one by one would be too slow.\n\nWithout another thought, he grabbed a nearby impact drill.\n\n\"Who cares what it is?\" he said, face alight with excitement. \"If it bleeds, it can be killed!!!\"\n\nHe had been waiting for this day for so long!!!\n\nFinally!\n\nHe had finally encountered something that looked like a monster!\n\nHe had to destroy it today!!\n\nSeeing Lu Ding raise the impact drill, ready to go, the people nearby rushed to stop him. \"Little Brother Lu, you can't, you can't! If you break a taboo, we'll all have bad luck.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, this might be some kind of Taisui.\"¹\n\n\"I heard from the older generation that Taisui grows in the earth, and eating it can extend your life.\"\n\n\"No, no, I heard my grandpa say that Taisui is an unlucky god. Better to provoke King Yama than to provoke Taisui. I think we should just bury it back.\"\n\nSeeing the crowd blocking him, Lu Ding thought, *This won't do.*\n\n\"What Taisui? Who cares about Taisui? Our construction site needs to move forward. So we dug up a rock. If it delays the project, who's going to take responsibility?\"\n\nHe looked around the circle. No one spoke.\n\nFinally, Lu Ding's gaze fell on the project manager, Luo Anping.\n\nIn that instant, everyone looked at him.\n\nLuo Anping felt like he was caught between a rock and a hard place.\n\nThat's right, they couldn't let this thing affect the project schedule, could they?\n\nLuo Anping cursed under his breath. Damn it, why did he always run into this kind of weird stuff?\n\nConstruction sites were most leery of digging up things like this.\n\nLast year they'd dug something up and it attracted the relevant authorities. This year, it happened again. It was as if God himself was determined to make life difficult for him, Luo Anping.\n\nJust then, Lu Ding added fuel to the fire.\n\n\"See? No one's talking. In the end, Manager Luo is the one who'll have to take the blame. You all have it figured out, don't you? Manager Luo, you just say the word. If you say not to drill this stone today, I'll drop my tools right now.\"\n\n*And I'll just come back quietly at night,* the thought echoed in Lu Ding's mind.\n\nHe continued aloud, \"If you give the nod, I'll drill seven or eight holes right through it. Don't forget, I'm a man of talent. I have a strong constitution; I'm not afraid of these things at all.\"\n\nThat last sentence gave Luo Anping the confidence he needed.\n\nHe hadn't wanted to provoke this thing. In the construction business, it was better to be safe than sorry.\n\nBut when Lu Ding mentioned he had talent, Luo Anping remembered that he wasn't the one doing the deed. Lu Ding was. What was there for him to be afraid of?\n\nHe gritted his teeth and stomped his foot.\n\n\"Drill!!\"\n\nLu Ding could no longer contain the smile on his face.\n\n\"Everyone, stand back!\"\n\nSeeing that they couldn't persuade him, and since they weren't the ones doing it, the workers all scattered to the side to watch the show.\n\nOnly Lu Ding was left. He started the impact drill, raised it, and drove it into the stone.\n\nAs the drill bit broke the surface, red liquid gushed out, some of it splashing onto Lu Ding's clothes.\n\nHe had a look of pure excitement on his face.\n\nThe workers watching the spectacle all took a few more steps back.\n\nA trace of fear for this young man, who looked so young, sprouted in their hearts.\n\n*This kid is ruthless!!!!*\n\nLuo Anping's eyes widened. He really hadn't made a mistake hiring Lu Ding. When trouble came, the kid really stepped up!!\n\n*A raise! He must get a raise! When we issue payroll tomorrow, I'll give him a bonus. A ten-thousand-yuan bonus!*\n\nAs the *thwack-thwack-thwack* of the impact drill echoed in his ears, Lu Ding's heart was about to leap into his throat.\n\n*Why hasn't my golden finger reacted yet!! Give me a sign!!!!*\n\nAs he screamed inwardly, a large chunk of rock broke off from the stone sphere.\n\nA horrifying scene appeared. Two tightly shut eyes were embedded in the sphere. Before anyone had time to cry out in shock, the next moment, the eyes on the stone sphere snapped open. Everyone present was an ordinary person; when had they ever seen such a thing?\n\nScreaming things like \"Ghost!\" and \"Monster!\", they turned and fled.\n\nEven Luo Anping was no exception.\n\nBut then he saw Lu Ding, still standing in the same spot. A conflicted expression crossed his face. In the end, he couldn't bring himself to run away alone. He turned back and grabbed Lu Ding.\n\n\"Xiao Lu, let's go!!! This thing is a monster!!!\"\n\n***\n\n¹**Taisui (太歲):** A complex term in Chinese folklore. It refers to both a star/deity in astrology (the \"Grand Duke of Jupiter\") that is considered unlucky to offend, and a rare, fleshy fungus-like growth found in the earth, which some legends claim can grant longevity. The workers' dialogue reflects both of these beliefs.",

    "content": ".....\n\n\"Don't stop me, let me drill him to death!!!\"\n\nLu Ding shook off Luo Anping's hand, turned on the impact drill, and jammed it right into the pair of open eyes.\n\nFresh blood sprayed out, splattering all over Lu Ding this time.\n\nAt the same moment, the stone ball let out a bizarre, bloodcurdling scream.\n\nLu Ding grinned. This was a monster. This was definitely a monster, no doubt about it!!!\n\nWhat kind of giant stone mallet bleeds and screams?\n\nBesides, it couldn't move right now. If he didn't kill it now, when would he?\n\nFor over a decade. For over a decade, Lu Ding had finally seen the hope of his Goldfinger unlocking.\n\nHow could he possibly let this opportunity go?\n\nFor this moment, he had prepared for over a decade!!!\n\nThe moment the stone ball opened its eyes, everyone was terrified—everyone except Lu Ding.\n\nOver the past ten-plus years, he had made every mental preparation to face a monster. He had even forced himself to cultivate a love for horror movies just to increase his tolerance.\n\nWhat kind of scene hadn't he seen? All in uncensored high-definition!!!\n\nHe was waiting for this very day.\n\nLuo Anping was completely dumbfounded. As expected, capable people were just built different.\n\nIn that moment, standing behind Lu Ding, he too felt a sliver of courage.\n\nFuck it, he wasn't running either!!!\n\nIt's not every day you get to see something this bizarre. Worst case, he'd just hide a little better behind Lu Ding.\n\nThe stone ball's screams grew more and more intense.\n\nThe smile never left Lu Ding's face. With a *crack*, the stone ball split in two, and in Lu Ding's mind, the pages of a book turned.\n\n【Monster Containment Prison Roster】\n\n【Monster Contained: Stubborn Stone of South Mountain (Unborn). Reward Acquired: The Way of the Axe-Chariot.】\n\n【The Way of the Axe-Chariot: Cleaves All Things.】\n\nA warm current surged through Lu Ding's entire body. He could clearly feel a power stirring within him, an indescribable sensation filling his mind.\n\nFinally, *finally*, he had unlocked the correct way to use his Goldfinger.\n\nLu Ding lamented how difficult the past decade had been.\n\nIf it weren't for the existence of his Goldfinger, he would have been tempted to risk deleting his character and starting over.\n\nNo father, no mother, starting the game on hell mode, leaving the orphanage at fourteen to fend for himself, having to study with nowhere to live—if it weren't for subsidies, he truly wouldn't have known how to survive.\n\nThankfully, he had finally made it through the worst of it.\n\nHe dropped the impact drill and sat on the ground.\n\nLuo Anping shakily offered him a cigarette, his lighter clicking several times before he managed to light it for Lu Ding.\n\n\"Seriously, little brother Lu, this old brother has lived for over thirty years and seen plenty of ruthless guys, but I've never seen anyone as ruthless as you,\" Luo Anping said, full of admiration.\n\nHe exhaled a puff of smoke, releasing the pent-up emotions in his heart.\n\nLu Ding cracked a smile. \"Brother Luo, can I get a raise?\"\n\n\"A raise, you got it. Bonus, salary, I'll count this month as twenty thousand for you. I'll transfer it to you on WeakChat right now.\"\n\nHe opened his phone, and twenty thousand was transferred directly to his account.\n\nHis Goldfinger was unlocked, and he had twenty thousand yuan in his pocket. Lu Ding had never felt so secure.\n\nIt was only then that he recalled the earlier notification.\n\nThe Stubborn Stone of South Mountain.\n\nThis thing was actually a creature of legend, though not from this world's legends, but from his previous one.\n\nThe *Zi Bu Yu*¹ records that a scholar named Chen Xiu from Haichang prayed for a dream at the Temple of Suming. In his dream, Lord Suming opened the main gate to welcome him, but the scholar hesitated...\n\nIt was a sprawling text of a thousand words, and Lu Ding couldn't remember the details.\n\nAnyway, the gist of it was that there was once a scholar who, before a journey, prayed for a dream to divine his fortune. He encountered a deity and the City God. During their conversation, the scholar overheard them murmuring something.\n\n\"Dies in Guangxi, is hit in Tangxi, the Stubborn Stone of South Mountain, lives for ten thousand years.\"\n\nLater, the scholar really did go to Guangxi and encountered an old man who was the stone spirit incarnate. They even struck up a conversation, and the scholar unilaterally believed they had become friends.\n\nLater, the old man asked for his help, saying that he had cultivated for ten thousand years but couldn't achieve apotheosis because he lacked a statue of the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens carved from three thousand catties² of sandalwood.\n\n\"You have to help me. We're friends. If you don't help me, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe scholar asked the old man what path he cultivated. The old man replied, \"The Way of the Axe-Chariot.\" This scared the daylights out of the scholar. Combine the characters for axe (斤) and chariot (車), and don't you get the character for \"sever\" (斬)?\n\nLater, the scholar lured the old man into a temple for the deity and the City God to deal with him, but the old man escaped. That was the Stubborn Stone of South Mountain.\n\nLu Ding truly hadn't expected to encounter the Stubborn Stone of South Mountain in this world.\n\nAnd an unborn one at that. He'd really lucked out.\n\nOtherwise, if this thing had been born, a hundred Lu Dings probably wouldn't have been enough for it to slaughter.\n\nBut the world isn't full of \"what ifs\" and \"maybes.\" In this round, Lu Ding had won!\n\nNow, all he had to do was will it, and he could unleash a sharp slashing attack. As for how powerful it was, Lu Ding didn't know yet.\n\nHe'd have to find a chance to test it.\n\nAfter finishing his cigarette, Lu Ding looked at the fractured Stubborn Stone of South Mountain, thinking that while he didn't know what it was used for, he absolutely couldn't let it go to waste; there was a high chance it was a treasure.\n\nHe pushed over a small wheelbarrow and placed the stone fragments inside. Seeing this, Luo Anping was somewhat confused but didn't ask any questions.\n\nHe was a project manager, after all. If he didn't have some perceptiveness and brains, how could he have gotten this position?\n\n\"Little Brother Lu, why don't you take a couple of days off?\" Luo Anping suggested, which was exactly what Lu Ding had been thinking.\n\n\"Alright. I'll take two days off then. Brother Luo, just call me back when things on the site have calmed down.\"\n\nCome back?\n\nLu Ding had no intention of coming back. Before, he had worked to survive. Now that his Goldfinger was unlocked, his goal was to specifically hunt monsters!\n\nHis life was destined to be anything but ordinary!!\n\nAs for money, that would come. The worst that could happen is that I won't eat beef!!\n\nHe pushed the wheelbarrow back to his dorm, threw out all the clothes in his suitcase, packed the stone fragments inside it, and headed straight for the little nest he rented for three hundred yuan a month in a resettlement housing unit.\n\nLu Ding had just left.\n\nLuo Anping hadn't even had a chance to catch his breath before someone showed up at his door, cornering him in his office.\n\nA man and a woman, dressed in sharp, practical attire.\n\nOne of them flashed credentials from a certain department. \"Where's the thing? Where's the man!\"\n\nLuo Anping wasn't the type to sell someone out at the drop of a hat, so he immediately played dumb.\n\n\"What thing? What man?\"\n\n*SLAM!!*\n\nA black pistol was slapped onto the desk. \"Feel like talking now?\"\n\nLuo Anping slid to his knees on the floor. \"Big Brother, Big Sister, it had nothing to do with me! It was all Lu Ding...\"\n\nHe recounted the entire sequence of events, complete with a playback of the 24k ultra-HD security footage.\n\nThe two watched from beginning to end. When it was over, they exchanged a glance, both seeing the shock in the other's eyes.\n\nThey turned and left, leaving only a single sentence behind: \"What happened here—you'd best let it rot in your heart. Don't speak of it. The tea they serve at the station isn't that good.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. I understand, I understand. Don't you worry.\"\n\nLuo Anping's face was plastered with a smile as brilliant as a chrysanthemum.³\n\nHe watched the two of them leave and let out a long breath. \"Brother Lu, I'm sorry. It's not that this brother didn't want to help you, I just really didn't dare.\"\n\nForget about daring to hide anything; Luo Anping didn't even dare to tip him off.\n\nThe credentials they'd shown him were from National Security.\n\n***\n\n¹ *Zi Bu Yu*, or *What the Master Would Not Discuss*, is a real collection of supernatural tales from the Qing Dynasty.\n² A *cattie* (斤, jìn) is a traditional Chinese unit of mass, approximately 600 grams or 1.3 pounds.\n³ The \"chrysanthemum smile\" is a metaphor for a forced, puckered smile. In modern Chinese slang, \"chrysanthemum\" (菊花, júhuā) is also a euphemism for the anus, adding a layer of crude, obsequious humor to the description of his expression.",

    "content": "...\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side.\n\nLu Ding successfully arrived at the foot of his building in the resettlement community.\n\nCarrying the suitcase containing the Stubborn Rock fragment, Lu Ding looked at the resettlement community where he had lived for five years and sighed inwardly.\n\n“I really am reluctant to leave. The environment is just average, but three hundred yuan a month for a one-bedroom, one-living-room apartment... where else could I find a deal that good?”\n\nLu Ding was preparing to move.\n\nPreviously, due to his special status and excellent academic performance, the social assistance department had arranged this three-hundred-yuan-a-month, one-bedroom resettlement apartment for him after he left the orphanage.\n\nHe had lived here ever since.\n\nBefore, it was because he had no money. Now that he did, and wouldn't be short on it in the future, Lu Ding naturally wouldn't continue to occupy national resources.\n\nThe apartment should be left for someone who needed it.\n\nAfter all, resettlement housing was extremely scarce.\n\nPlenty of people needed a place like this.\n\nLu Ding also needed to move to a better living environment.\n\nTonight was his last night. With a strange mix of feelings, Lu Ding returned to apartment 1503.\n\nHe changed his shoes, took a shower to wash away his fatigue, and finally opened the suitcase, taking out the Stubborn Rock fragment to examine it closely.\n\nOther than the lingering bloodstains, it didn't really look all that different from an ordinary rock.\n\n“What could this thing be used for?” he wondered.\n\n“As a medicinal ingredient? For forging?”\n\nThese two answers surfaced in Lu Ding's mind. Beyond that, he couldn't think of any other uses. No matter how hard he stared, it showed no magical changes.\n\nSo,\n\nLu Ding gave up.\n\nHe got up, went to the balcony to start packing his clothes, and prepared for the move tomorrow.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, he inadvertently glanced out the window and saw what looked like a figure standing in the bamboo forest behind the complex. As Lu Ding looked over, it looked back at him.\n\nTheir gazes collided in mid-air.\n\nBefore Lu Ding could even register that something was wrong,\n\nHe saw the figure in the bamboo forest raise its hand and point, slowly moving its finger upward in his direction.\n\nThis gesture…\n\nInstantly made Lu Ding understand.\n\n*This guy is counting what floor I live on!*\n\nNo way!\n\nI just unlocked my golden finger!¹\n\nAre you being this arrogant?!\n\nOpenly counting my floor like that, what's the big idea? Looking for trouble? A robbery?\n\nThe thought was intolerable. He had just unlocked his golden finger—was he going to let himself be intimidated?\n\nHe threw down the clothes in his hands.\n\n“Stop fucking counting! I live in 1503! Come on up if you’ve got the guts!”\n\nHe had just been worrying about how to test the power of his Path of the Jin Che's slash, and now someone was serving themselves up on a platter. Weren't they tired of living?\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\nLu Ding instantly felt he had misjudged. This thing wasn't human!\n\nNow Lu Ding was even more excited!\n\nThe moment he shouted, the figure in the bamboo forest broke into a run toward his building. Its speed was incredible, covering several meters in a single step. In the faint light, Lu Ding could even see the long fur rippling on its body.\n\nHow could a person possibly have fur that long?\n\nAs the long-haired monster disappeared into the back entrance of the building,\n\nLu Ding grew ecstatic.\n\n“Damn it! When they don't show up, they *really* don't show up—I haven't seen a single hair for nineteen years! Then they appear, and two pop up in one night! Are you guys nuts? If the density is this high, why did you make me wait nineteen damn years?!”\n\nHe couldn't stay in his apartment; the space was too small to maneuver.\n\nLu Ding quickly put on his shoes and went out into the corridor. He was going to move the battlefield to the hallway or the stairwell.\n\nHe went to the top of the stairs to wait.\n\nLu Ding looked down and saw a dark figure ascending the stairs at a terrifying speed.\n\nThe voice-activated lights on each floor lit up one after another.\n\nTenth floor, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth.\n\nLu Ding's adrenaline spiked. The instant the fourteenth-floor light came on,\n\nHe raised his hand and threw out a slash.\n\nA sensation of sharp-edged power erupted. An invisible slash tore through the iron handrail, cutting through metal as if it were mud, and left deep gashes on the mottled walls of the old building, like marks from a sword or an axe.\n\nThe voice-activated light illuminated the entire scene.\n\nLu Ding tilted his head to look.\n\nOn the central landing of the stairwell, the monster had been slammed against the wall, knocking loose a lot of plaster.\n\nA deep gash was carved into its chest, running from its shoulder to its ribs. No blood dripped from it, nor were there any bones or flesh. Instead, intertwined vines and countless tiny tentacles writhed within the wound.\n\nIt was only now that Lu Ding got a full view of the monster's appearance.\n\nIt was entirely black, over two meters tall, and covered in long black fur, yet it didn't look bulky—it was almost slender.\n\nIts face was like a withered mask, and its eyes glowed with a faint yellow light, like lightbulbs.\n\nIts appearance was ferocious and ugly.\n\nBut still acceptable!\n\nThe monster looked up slightly, meeting Lu Ding's gaze.\n\nBoth of their eyes held the same excitement.\n\n“And here I thought you were so tough. Turns out you were just rushing here to die. I just wonder if your neck is as tough as your chest.”\n\nAn instantaneous slash, with no wind-up, shot forward.\n\nThe monster sensed it and ducked to avoid it, but not quite in time. The top half of its head was sliced clean off.\n\nA roar shook all fifteen floors of the building,\n\nand also startled the two-person team from 749 who had just arrived at the complex to find him.\n\nHearing the cry,\n\nThe two exchanged a look.\n\n“The roar of a Wǎng Xiàng!”\n\n“This is bad!”\n\nThey stomped their feet, shattering the ground tiles, and crossed the distance from the complex gate to the building entrance in two strides.\n\nJust then,\n\nA dark shadow plummeted from the sky and slammed heavily onto the ground.\n\nThe pair looked over and saw that the monster, besides its black fur, was covered in slash marks.\n\nThe once-ferocious beast was now lying on the ground, more dead than alive, its body struggling to get up and flee the area, as if some terrifying existence it couldn't possibly compare to lived here.\n\n“Run! So now you know how to run? What the hell were you doing earlier? I'll let you run!”\n\nAnother slash came down. The monster, which was already staggering to its feet, instantly collapsed, its body bisected. The upper half fell away, while its two legs remained standing.\n\nThe duo downstairs subconsciously looked up into the air.\n\nThey saw a small black dot using the balconies as footholds, nimbly flipping and maneuvering before landing on the ground.\n\nAt that moment, a slight wind picked up.\n\nThe faces of the two agents stung painfully, as if someone were slicing their skin with a small knife.\n\nLooking again at the monster's upper body, they saw it had been diced by a cross-shaped cut and now lay on the ground in four large pieces.\n\nLu Ding felt a new power being born within him.\n\n[Monster Contained: Wǎng Xiàng]\n[Containment Reward: The Meaning of Forgetting Form]\n[The Meaning of Forgetting Form: Qi flows through the celestial window,² forgetting self and others, achieving the unity of heaven and man.]\n\nThis name also jogged Lu Ding's memory.\n\n*Wǎng Xiàng*.\n\nRecords of it could be found in Taoist scriptures, the *Huainanzi*, and the *Analects of Confucius*, though the descriptions varied. In the *Huainanzi* and the *Analects*, the Wǎng Xiàng was described as a water-born evil spirit or a mountain rock sprite that devoured humans.\n\nThe Taoist scriptures, however, described it as a state: a spiritual journey through the *tiānchuāng*—the fontanelle at the top of the head—an image of nothingness. This was also called ‘forgetting form,’ the state of the unity of heaven and man.\n\nAnd this reward, ‘The Meaning of Forgetting Form,’ was precisely that unity. With this skill, Lu Ding could now consciously control the state of the unity of heaven and man!\n\nA state that was uncontrollable for others, Lu Ding could now activate manually.\n\nThis was a massive gain.\n\nThe two people who had come looking for him were also stunned.\n\nIf the South Mountain Stubborn Rock incident was a stroke of dumb luck, then this violent slaughter of a Wǎng Xiàng was a display of absolute, raw power.\n\nMoreover, it was something that even they couldn't have accomplished.\n\nDon't be fooled by how Lu Ding had thrashed the Wǎng Xiàng like it was a helpless chick, killing it as he pleased.\n\nIf it had been them, an arduous battle would have been unavoidable.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Golden Finger (金手指):** A common term in Chinese web novels for a protagonist's unique cheat, special ability, or system that gives them an unfair advantage.\n2.  **Celestial Window (天窗):** A term from Daoist meditation and medicine referring to the fontanelle, the soft spot on the top of the head, considered a point of connection with cosmic energy or the heavens.",

    "content": ".....\n\n\"Excuse me... you're Lu Ding, right?\"\n\nA man's voice called out.\n\nLu Ding turned around. He had noticed the two of them a moment ago, but with the monster right there, he had no choice but to kill it first. What caught Lu Ding's attention, however, was their attitude when facing the monster and reacting to the scene just now.\n\n\"I'm Lu Ding. And you are?\"\n\nZhou Jie wore a gentle smile. \"We are trainee investigators from Bureau 749. My name is Zhou Jie, and she is Long Shanshan.\"\n\n\"We came today to ask you about the situation at the construction site earlier. This isn't the best place to talk, could we go somewhere else?\"\n\nBureau 749!!!\n\nThe name resounded like thunder to Lu Ding.\n\nIn his past life and his present one, it was a name shrouded in a heavy air of mystery.\n\nMoreover, it was a mix of half-truth and half-fiction, impossible to verify.\n\nHe never thought that people from Bureau 749 would actually come looking for him today.\n\nLu Ding nodded. \"Let's talk at my place.\"\n\nHe turned, about to collect his spoils of war, only to see that the corpse of the Wangxiang that had been lying on the ground had vanished!\n\n\"Huh!!?\"\n\nLong Shanshan spoke up to explain, \"That was a Mu Wang, a wood and stone spirit. After death, they dissipate back into the earth.\"\n\nSo that's how it was. That was something Lu Ding didn't know.\n\nHe felt a pang of regret. If he could have preserved it, it might have been useful.\n\nSeeing the look of disappointment on his face, both Zhou Jie and Long Shanshan's eyebrows twitched. On their way here, they had reviewed Lu Ding's file.\n\nBesides his excellent grades, he was a completely ordinary person, just a bit more mature for his age at most.\n\nBut considering Lu Ding's upbringing, being precocious was perfectly normal.\n\nHis current performance, however, was not that of an ordinary person at all.\n\nFirst, he faced an unhatched Nanshan Stubborn Stone with an impact drill, getting covered in its blood without a hint of fear, looking excited instead. Now, he had brutally slayed a Mu Wang and looked disappointed he couldn't collect the corpse.\n\nAnd you're telling me, with a performance like this, he's just an ordinary person!!!?\n\nThey followed Lu Ding home.\n\nSeeing the fragments of the Stubborn Stone placed in the living room, the two of them let out another long sigh.\n\nAfter some thought, Zhou Jie decided to speak up. \"Lu Ding, you can't just leave the Nanshan Stubborn Stone lying around.\"\n\n\"Huh? Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it is an essence of heaven and earth, of the same origin but a different type as things like Tai Sui. It holds a considerable attraction for all kinds of spirits and demons. The Mu Wang just now was likely drawn here by it.\"\n\nLu Ding's eyes lit up.\n\nThere was such a benefit!\n\nIn that case, he should just carry this thing around on the streets!\n\nThe current Lu Ding was desperate for more monsters to come find him!\n\nNoticing his expression wasn't right, Long Shanshan guessed what he was thinking and quickly interjected, \"You can't be reckless. Attracting a Mu Wang is a small matter, but if you draw something terrifying, forget fighting it, you won't even be able to run away.\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding gave up on the idea.\n\nWhile he wanted to kill more monsters for more rewards, it would be a huge problem if he attracted something he couldn't handle.\n\nHe put away the Nanshan Stubborn Stone fragments.\n\nThe three of them sat down.\n\nZhou Jie pressed the recorder on his chest and began, \"Then I'll start.\"\n\n\"Lu Ding, we'd like to ask, did you open your aperture during the process of killing the Nanshan Stubborn Stone?\"\n\n\"Open my aperture?\"\n\nLu Ding was a little confused.\n\nZhou Jie patiently explained, \"People like us are called Qi Refiners. It's like cultivators in novels. To become a cultivator, you need spiritual roots. In the real world, there's no such thing as spiritual roots; it's all about innate talent.\"\n\n\"This is something you either have or you don't. An ordinary person with cultivation talent is usually no different from anyone else. Only when they encounter an external stimulus, or undergo a baptism like you did, will that talent manifest.\"\n\n\"We don't need to talk about stimuli; let's focus on the baptism. The baptism is also called spirit-point aperture opening. It uses heavenly materials and earthly treasures to awaken one's own talent, changing it from latent to manifest. During this process, there's a certain probability of absorbing and awakening an innate talent for the arts of the item used for the spirit-point aperture opening.\"\n\n\"The blood of the Nanshan Stubborn Stone, and its body itself, are a type of heavenly material and earthly treasure. So, that slashing ability of yours was very likely absorbed from the Nanshan Stubborn Stone's innate talent. And you yourself have another talent, I don't know if you've discovered it yet.\"\n\nLu Ding pondered this.\n\nThis was great, it saved him the trouble of coming up with an explanation.\n\nAs for his own innate talent, that could serve as a good foundation for future rewards.\n\nHe shook his head and then asked the question on his mind, \"Is it possible to absorb and awaken more talents like this later on?\"\n\n\"Impossible. This talent absorption is only possible during the first spirit-point aperture opening, where you can absorb and fuse it to become your instinct. Of course, you can still learn various arts and divine abilities later, but they won't be as instinctive to use as an extension of yourself.\"\n\nLu Ding understood. It was an eye-opening lesson.\n\nHe went along with Zhou Jie's line of reasoning. \"Then I guess I must have opened my aperture.\"\n\nAs expected!\n\nZhou Jie and Long Shanshan thought in unison.\n\nThe Nanshan Stubborn Stone was an incredibly rare treasure. Using it for a spirit-point aperture opening to become a Qi Refiner was perfectly normal. It was within the realm of reason, yet completely unexpected.\n\nAlthough absorbing the innate talent of the item used for the aperture opening was a plausible explanation, the probability was extremely low.\n\nAnd once successful, it meant becoming a dual-talent wielder.\n\nThat was a huge head start on everyone else. It was truly enviable.\n\nNot to mention Lu Ding possessed such terrifying combat strength right after his aperture opening.\n\nIt was infuriating to compare yourself to someone like that.\n\nZhou Jie and Long Shanshan attributed Lu Ding's current terrifying strength to the Nanshan Stubborn Stone.\n\nThey had originally thought this was just a minor incident on their patrol route. Who knew there would be a Nanshan Stubborn Stone involved? If they had known about this thing, a formal investigator would have likely been sent instead.\n\nAfter the questioning concluded, Zhou Jie got to the main point.\n\n\"Here's the situation, Lu Ding. For people like you who have opened their aperture, Bureau 749 has two management standards. The first is to join Bureau 749, start as a trainee investigator, and after completing ten missions or containing ten monsters, you can be promoted to a formal investigator.\"\n\n\"Formal investigators receive seven insurances and three funds,¹ and a monthly salary of fifty thousand yuan, with missions paid separately. Trainee investigators get thirty thousand yuan a month, also with separate pay for missions. You must accept at least one mission per month.\"\n\n\"In addition, by joining Bureau 749, you will have access to cultivation resources and channels to exchange for cultivation techniques, as well as instructors to guide your cultivation, just like joining a sect in a novel. Beyond that, there are numerous conveniences in public life, including but not limited to carrying a firearm, unconditional cooperation from local departments, possession of temporary supreme command authority at the local level, and so on.\"\n\n\"As for the other option, you don't join Bureau 749, but you must guarantee that you will not endanger society, and you must report to the local Bureau 749 branch once a month. Furthermore, you are not permitted to leave the country.\"\n\nBetween these two options, anyone who wasn't an idiot could make the choice.\n\nJoining Bureau 749 came with so many benefits, why wouldn't he join? Besides, Lu Ding felt a strong sense of belonging to the Great Han. After all, the reason he could live a decent life, have a place to stay, and get an education was all thanks to the various subsidies and relief funds from the Great Han.\n\nA stable government job sounded pretty good.\n\nAnd he could cultivate, which was what piqued Lu Ding's interest the most.\n\n\"You just mentioned cultivation. How does that work?\"\n\n***\n\n¹A generous version of China's social insurance package, indicating excellent employee benefits.",

    "content": "......\n\n\"It's like this: once a person has an awakening, they can become a Qi Refiner. But to cultivate, you must have a cultivation method and the support of resources. These things are only available from Bureau 749 or certain Qi Refiner sects, and the sects generally don't accept disciples casually.\"\n\n\"So, if you want to cultivate, your best bet is to join Bureau 749. By completing missions, you can earn contribution points to exchange for cultivation methods and materials.\"\n\n\"Newcomers who join Bureau 749 get one chance to choose a basic cultivation method for free. You could consider it an employee benefit.\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding didn't hesitate for a second. \"I want to join Bureau 749!!!\"\n\nHe could get stronger through the rewards from his golden finger¹, of course.\n\nBut this was different.\n\nHe had a skill like \"Forgetting Form\" that allowed him to achieve unity with nature. If he didn't learn to cultivate, wouldn't that be a waste!\n\nCultivate, he must cultivate!\n\nHearing Lu Ding's answer, the smile on Zhou Jie's face could no longer be suppressed.\n\nBureau 749 had a rule: if you helped recruit a newcomer for the bureau, you would be rewarded based on the strength of the recruit's talent.\n\nThe gains from this mission were originally supposed to be small.\n\nBut with Lu Ding joining, the moment he was officially on board, Zhou Jie's reward would be anything but small.\n\nThis wasn't a guess; it was what he had seen with his own eyes.\n\nSomeone who had just awakened could slaughter a Muwang—how could that kind of talent be weak!?\n\nAnd he was a dual-talent holder, at that.\n\nZhou Jie couldn't even begin to imagine what kind of reward he would get.\n\nAfter quickly packing his things, Lu Ding dragged his suitcase and got into the car with Zhou Jie, heading for Bureau 749.\n\nHe had already been to two different places in one night.\n\nBefore leaving, Lu Ding asked, \"What about the hallway in the apartment building? I smashed it up pretty good.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, someone will come to handle the cleanup. It'll be even better than it was before.\"\n\nHearing that, Lu Ding felt relieved.\n\nThey drove out of the city.\n\nWatching the scenery fly by, Lu Ding was a little puzzled. \"Is Bureau 749 really that far from the city? What happens if there's an incident in the urban area?\"\n\n\"There are people on patrol in the city every day. Today, the construction site area was my and Shanshan's responsibility. If a situation arises that we can't handle, we report it, and someone more powerful will come.\"\n\nRight, how could Bureau 749 not have thought of something he could think of.\n\nAs the car entered a tunnel, the view before them changed.\n\nWhen they emerged, they had arrived at a base nestled in a mountain valley.\n\nLu Ding found it all novel.\n\nFollowing Zhou Jie and Long Shanshan, he came to a large hall to register his information and answer various questions.\n\nFinally, he walked through a small door.\n\nZhou Jie and Long Shanshan waved goodbye to him.\n\nAfter Lu Ding's figure disappeared from view, Long Shanshan asked, \"Aren't you going to wait for him a bit?\"\n\n\"He's going to be in a different world from us from now on. We won't be running in the same circles. Besides, we still have our assigned area to patrol. We've got a lot to do, let's go.\"\n\nJust being on friendly terms was good enough.\n\nZhou Jie was clear-headed and pragmatic. They were on different levels now and were destined to walk different paths. Better to part ways where they stood and just leave a good impression for any future encounters.\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nLu Ding followed a staff member down a corridor brimming with a sense of technology.\n\nBoth sides were transparent glass.\n\nLooking through, he could see specimen after specimen of lifelike yet bizarre monsters standing behind the glass walls.\n\nThey varied in size and expression.\n\nThere were ferocious ones, terrifying ones, mysterious ones, elegant ones, and some that were indescribable but possessed an absolute beauty.\n\nThe sheer variety was dazzling.\n\nA thought crossed Lu Ding's mind: if only he had been the one to kill all these monsters.\n\nHow many rewards would he have gotten then!!\n\nWhat a pity.\n\nPassing through the corridor.\n\nHaving gotten a glimpse of Bureau 749's base, he arrived at a room. The staff member swiped the door open and said, \"Mr. Lu, please rest here for a while. It's past midnight, so it's already the first day of the new month. The intern recruits who joined Bureau 749 last month will have their unified assessment for registration this morning.\"\n\n\"You can watch and observe then, to prepare for next month's assessment.\"\n\nBefore the staff member could leave, Lu Ding quickly asked, \"What does 'assessment for registration' mean?\"\n\n\"It's like this: every newcomer who joins Bureau 749 must undergo an assessment for registration, which is usually held on the first day of the lunar month.\"\n\n\"The assessment mainly tests combat power. Based on the results and observations during the test, newcomers are assigned a rank. This facilitates future mission assignments and avoids unnecessary casualties. The benefits also differ.\"\n\n\"Those with an average performance will be assigned to an eight-person dormitory, receive no rewards, and will not be allowed to accept monster containment missions. They must wait until they pass a combat power assessment before they can accept missions involving external monster containment, investigation, and so on.\"\n\n\"Those with a good performance will be assigned to a four-person dormitory, be rewarded with a serving of Muscle-Boosting Bone-Forging Soup, and can accept missions on the Bureau 749 app to assist official investigators in containing monsters.\"\n\n\"Those with an excellent performance will be assigned to a two-person dormitory, be rewarded with an All-Penetrating Rhino Pill to aid their awakening, and can serve as the main investigator for non-combat missions or as an auxiliary investigator for combat missions.\"\n\n\"And those with a perfect performance get a single dormitory, are rewarded with an Awakening Pill that uses gentle medicinal power to open all the body's apertures and directly enter the Illuminating Jade Realm. They can accept monster containment missions from the Bureau 749 app without assisting an official investigator, with priority equal to that of an official investigator. They only need to complete ten missions or contain ten monsters to become an official investigator.\"\n\n\"Since you've just joined Bureau 749, you have one month to choose and comprehend a cultivation method before participating in the assessment on the first of next month. You'll have plenty of time.\"\n\nThat may have been the case, but Lu Ding truly couldn't wait a whole month.\n\nWasn't that just a waste of time!!!\n\nSuddenly, an idea flashed in his mind.\n\n\"Hey!!\"\n\n\"I should have arrived at the base before midnight, right? Doesn't that mean I technically joined last month? And tomorrow is the first, so can I take the assessment?\"\n\nSeeing Lu Ding's eyes practically glowing as he spoke, the staff member felt as if this person hadn't understood what he was trying to say at all.\n\n\"You can, but rushing into the assessment will likely result in a poor score. Even though you're a dual-talent holder, you only just had your awakening. My advice is to settle in for a month, get into your best shape, learn a cultivation method first, and then take the assessment in a month's time in peak condition.\"\n\n\"Besides, you're currently in the pre-registration phase, so you get a single room anyway.\"\n\nLu Ding shook his head. \"No, no, no, I'm not some student-athlete, I don't need to 'settle in'. Does the assessment require registration? If it does, please sign me up right now. I'll take the test with the others tomorrow.\"\n\nHe had already waited nineteen years. He had finally gotten his golden finger unlocked and usable.\n\nNow he had joined Bureau 749, which meant he basically wouldn't have to search for monsters like a needle in a haystack anymore.\n\nAnd now you're telling him to wait?\n\nLu Ding didn't want to wait another second!\n\nHe could totally pick a cultivation method after finishing the assessment tomorrow.\n\nThe staff member was a little speechless. Everyone else hoped and prayed for more time to get stronger before taking the assessment to get the best possible score.\n\nBut this guy looked like he couldn't wait at all!\n\nDid having dual talents give you the right to be this arrogant!?\n\n\"Fine, I'll sign you up. This is a Bureau 749 employee phone. It has the Bureau 749 app on it. You can log in with your personal information to view and browse materials.\"\n\n---\n¹Golden finger (金手指): A common term in Chinese webnovels for a special power, item, or \"cheat\" that the protagonist possesses, giving them a unique advantage.",

    "content": "......\n\nThe staff member left.\n\nLu Ding lay on the bed. Following the staff member's earlier instructions, he logged into his personal profile and browsed the information on the 749 App.\n\nThat night, Lu Ding was like a dry sponge, soaking up waters he had never experienced before.\n\nHe roamed the ocean of knowledge.\n\nLearning about the other, unknown side of this world.\n\nLu Ding also came to understand the cultivation realms of Qi Refiners.\n\nFrom lowest to highest, they were divided into realms such as Kaiqiao, Zhaoxuan, Linghai, Shengong, Siming, Dicha, and Tiancha. There were likely more after that, but at his current clearance level, Lu Ding couldn't see them yet.\n\nIn addition, there were all sorts of unheard-of monsters, as well as heavenly materials and earthly treasures.\n\nAmong the entries, Lu Ding also found information about the South Mountain Stubborn Stone.\n\nSouth Mountain Stubborn Stone: belongs to the class of spirit monsters, and is also listed among heavenly materials and earthly treasures.\n\nThe red liquid inside it is Earth Qi Essence, which can be used for Kaiqiao. The remaining stone limbs can be used to forge weapons.\n\nMoreover, it was a rare and excellent material. Even if he didn't use it himself, he could exchange it with 749 for contribution points. Lu Ding wouldn't consider that.\n\nSeeing this, Lu Ding thought to himself, \"It really is a treasure!\"\n\n\"So, what kind of weapon should I forge?\"\n\nWith this question in mind, Lu Ding slowly drifted off to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, the alarm clock rang. He got up and washed his face. Another new staff member came to the door to lead Lu Ding to the assessment venue.\n\nAfter many twists and turns, with people coming and going on all sides, Lu Ding finally arrived at the assessment venue.\n\nThe place was buzzing with voices. Looking ahead, he saw an area the size of a soccer field, sunken several meters deep, with sixty-odd people scattered about inside.\n\nOn the edge of the venue, men and women, young and old, dressed in various attires and holding all manner of weapons—swords, spears, sabers, and halberds—had gathered to watch the excitement.\n\nThe sounds of their conversations filled the air.\n\n\"What a pity. When I joined 749, it was the sixteenth of the month. I only had fourteen days before my assessment started, and I ended up with an 'Average' score. If I'd had more time, I could have gotten a good score.\"\n\n\"You call that a pity? I joined on the twenty-third, I remember it clearly. Damn it, that month only had twenty-nine days. I had the worst luck. And even then, I got an 'Average.' If I'd joined earlier like you, I bet my score would have been pretty good!\"\n\n\"So yeah, luck is part of strength. For this month's assessment, there are eight newcomers who joined before the fifth. I bet all eight of them will get 'Excellent,' maybe even 'Perfect.'\"\n\n\"I believe 'Excellent,' but 'Perfect' isn't something you can achieve in just a month. If anyone could get a 'Perfect' score just by joining a few days earlier, wouldn't the Kaiqiao Pills in our bureau be a dime a dozen?\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, that's true. Slaying a hundred wooden puppets in an hour is a bit unrealistic, huh.\"\n\n\"Then in your opinion, who do you think will get 'Perfect' this time?\"\n\n\"It has to be Liu Yun. She's got that Demon Blade and even awakened the Shadow Walk talent, allowing her to dart and weave through dark shadows. Paired with that sharp Demon Blade, the wooden puppets in the assessment arena probably won't even be able to touch her before she cuts them down.\"\n\n\"Liu Yun is definitely a candidate, and she arrived on the tenth of last month, so she's had plenty of time.\"\n\n\"I think, besides Liu Yun, Chu Hao could also do it. He and Liu Yun both came on the tenth, and they're classmates. He also has the Vine Armor and the ability to control wood. This assessment venue is full of wooden puppets; it's his home turf. It's just that his damage output isn't quite enough.\"\n\n\"Tsk, see? I told you luck is a part of strength. I heard Liu Yun and Chu Hao are both university students from the same club. On the ninth of last month, their club had an activity, and over twenty of them went on a trip to an ancient town. A supernatural incident broke out, and in the end, they were the only two left alive before they were rescued by our investigators.\"\n\n\"Not only did those two successfully achieve Kaiqiao, but they each had a magical artifact bond with them. Their luck is really something else.\"\n\nLiu Yun... Chu Hao...\n\nAs Lu Ding listened, he realized they were from his university.\n\nBoth were from the Ancient Style Club. Chu Hao, like Lu Ding, was a freshman at Yunhai University, only he was in the Department of Economics and Management while Lu Ding was in the Department of Geological Surveying. They had seen each other during public lectures.\n\nAs for Liu Yun, she was a third-year senior and the president of the Ancient Style Club, a well-known traditional beauty at the school.\n\nHe hadn't expected them to have joined 749 as well.\n\nIt seems there are familiar faces everywhere.\n\nBut Lu Ding didn't pay it much mind, just marveling at the coincidence.\n\nHe turned his head and asked the staff member who was opening the entrance gate for him, \"Excuse me, I'd like to ask, how are the assessment standards you all were just talking about defined?\"\n\n\"The assessment lasts for one hour. Slaying ten monsters is 'Pass.' Eleven to forty is 'Average.' Forty-one to seventy is 'Good.' Seventy-one to ninety-nine is 'Excellent.' Slaying a hundred or more in an hour is 'Perfect.'\"\n\nSo that's how the ratings worked.\n\nSimple and direct.\n\nLu Ding said thank you and stepped into the assessment venue.\n\nThe moment he entered, countless gazes turned toward him.\n\n\"Why is there an extra person?\"\n\n\"Weren't there sixty-four? How did it become sixty-five?\"\n\n\"Could it be a newcomer who joined in the last few days?\"\n\n\"Isn't that just suicidal? He just achieved Kaiqiao and probably hasn't even gotten the hang of his cultivation method, and he's already here for the assessment?\"\n\n\"You only get one chance at the assessment. He'll probably regret this later. Now even getting a 'Pass' will be difficult. Sigh, young people are too reckless.\"\n\n\"What do you mean reckless? He just can't tell fantasy from reality. He thinks just because he achieved Kaiqiao, he's a chosen one, the protagonist of the world. He doesn't know his own limits is all.\"\n\n\"Why do you have to be so prickly? You seem to know a lot. Is it because you used to think that way and then got a harsh reality check?\"\n\nLu Ding's sudden appearance had attracted the attention not only of the spectators but also of the other participants in the arena.\n\nLiu Yun and Chu Hao looked over. Seeing Lu Ding's face, they both found him a little familiar.\n\n\"That person seems to be a freshman from our school. I saw him moving equipment to the warehouse after the military training ended.\"\n\nLiu Yun's words jogged Chu Hao's memory. \"Now that you mention it, I think I've seen him in the public lecture hall too.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect to run into a classmate here. Come on, let's go say hi.\"\n\nLiu Yun was about to walk forward when Chu Hao called out to stop her. \"I don't think that's necessary. We've been here for so long and never seen him; he must have just joined recently. He doesn't understand the reality of the situation and has come running to the assessment, completely arrogant and unaware of his own limits. His score definitely won't be good. We should just focus on ourselves.\"\n\nHis voice wasn't hushed in the slightest, allowing Lu Ding to hear him clearly.\n\nLu Ding turned his head to look. Why was this person's mouth so nasty?\n\nHe would take the assessment whenever he wanted, and this guy had to judge whether he could distinguish reality or not.\n\nHe even pronounced Lu Ding's fate, stating that his score wouldn't be good.\n\nNot only was it annoying to listen to, but the look he gave was filled with contempt, an air of haughty arrogance. It's one thing to whisper behind someone's back, but he wasn't even hiding it, provoking him to his face.\n\nLu Ding wasn't about to put up with that.\n\nHe flicked a finger, and a slashing attack erupted forth, striking Chu Hao’s Vine Armor heavily. It was so fast that no one present had time to react.\n\nChu Hao was sent flying and slammed into the ground.\n\nA knot of air was stuck in his chest, and he couldn't spit it out. A vicious gash on his chest had nearly sliced through the Vine Armor.\n\nLu Ding's voice followed. \"When other people are doing something, you'd do well to stop pointing fingers. We're not close. Next time you can't control that mouth of yours, you can say goodbye to your teeth!\"\n\nLiu Yun rushed forward to help Chu Hao up. When she saw the damage on his chest, her pupils suddenly shrank.\n\nShe and Chu Hao had tested it before; even her Demon Blade couldn't have damaged the Vine Armor that much. How could this person cause such a terrifying mark with just a flick of his finger?",

It had clearly become a dead object, most likely ruined.\n\nLiu Yun, unable to suppress her anger, said, \"Don't you think you've gone a bit too far? He just said a few things.\"\n\nLu Ding crossed his arms. \"Yeah, I went too far. So what? What are you going to do about it?\"\n\n*He was just running his mouth, he was just joking, he didn't mean what he said*—Lu Ding found such words disgusting.\n\nHe couldn't be bothered to argue about who was right or wrong. You ran your mouth first, so I'm hitting you today. What about it!!\n\n\"You...\"\n\nRight, what could she do? There was nothing she could do.\n\nHer strength was not much different from Chu Hao's. If Chu Hao couldn't block that blow, neither could she, and she wouldn't have even been able to react in time.\n\nIn a situation like this, if she had stepped up, she probably would have been defeated in an instant as well.\n\n\"Alright, just hold it in. I don't like what you have to say, and I won't go easy on you either.\"\n\n[Candidates are not permitted to attack one another. Please prepare yourselves. The assessment will begin in five minutes.]\n\nA voice echoed through the assessment hall.\n\nThe events that had just unfolded were witnessed by the spectators outside.\n\nIt instantly ignited a wave of discussion.\n\n\"Wait, what happened? Why did they suddenly start fighting out of nowhere?\"\n\n\"He sent Chu Hao, who has the Vine Armor, flying with one move! You're telling me he's a new recruit? I'd believe you if you said he was an Official Investigator!\"\n\n\"That must be a Talent, right? The power of that Talent is a little too terrifying.\"\n\n\"I admit this guy's strong, but his personality is a bit of a problem. Starting a fight just like that, isn't he a little too arrogant?\"\n\n\"Quit your damn whining and putting others down. 'A little too arrogant'~? If you think he's arrogant, why don't you wait for his assessment to be over and go fight him yourself? With the power of that slash, and it was just a flick of his finger, if he used his full strength, let's see if he doesn't separate your head from your ass.\"\n\n\"He has every right to be arrogant! If I had that kind of strength, I'd be even more arrogant than him! That Chu Hao guy, just because he has a magical artifact, he walks around with his nose in the air all day. We're all Intern Investigators, how many of us has he ever given a pleasant look? Finally, someone's here to put him in his place!\"\n\n\"Didn't he get into a conflict with some other newcomers before? He relied on his Vine Armor's defense, and after beating them, he even called them trash. I think *he's* the trash! Now he doesn't dare to let out a peep. Sucks up to the strong and stomps on the weak. Feels good now, doesn't it? Hahahaha.\"\n\nThe atmosphere outside the arena was pushed to a new high.\n\nAs five minutes passed in the blink of an eye, Chu Hao finally managed to exhale the breath he'd been holding back in frustration. His complexion returned to normal. Looking at Lu Ding not far away, his eyes were filled with apprehension.\n\nWhen he realized his Vine Armor was basically ruined, that apprehension turned into terror.\n\nWhen someone is not that different from you in strength, you will resent them, be wary of them, and harbor thoughts of revenge, patiently waiting for a future opportunity.\n\nBut when the gap between you and that person is like the difference between the clouds and the mud, you will only fear them, be terrified of them. Revenge? A future opportunity? None of that exists anymore.\n\nYou wouldn't dare to think it, wouldn't dare to do it.\n\nChu Hao himself understood that his past arrogance, with the exception of Liu Yun, meant he never gave any other Intern Investigator he met the time of day.\n\nThe source of all this confidence came from his Vine Armor.\n\nBut now that the Vine Armor was broken, his confidence had dissipated along with it.\n\nOriginally full of confidence for this assessment, he now felt a void of fear in his heart.\n\nOne by one, two-meter-tall, bizarrely-shaped wooden men emerged from the ground. Chu Hao took half a step back in fear.\n\nBefore, he had the Vine Armor to block external attacks, so he only needed to focus on attacking with all his might. But now that the Vine Armor was gone, he had to consider dodging. A solid hit on his body would really hurt.\n\nFollowing the broadcasted announcement of \"Assessment, begin!!!\"\n\nHundreds of Wooden Men launched their charge.\n\nA look of excitement on his face, Lu Ding was the first to leap forward.\n\n\"Come on!\"\n\nWith a wave of his hand, a horizontal slash spanning ten meters shot out instantly.\n\nEverywhere it passed, until its power faded, a dozen Wooden Men were sliced in two at the waist.\n\nNo prompt appeared before his eyes.\n\nLu Ding felt a sense of regret.\n\nThough it wasn't very realistic, he had fantasized about whether killing these monsters would yield any rewards.\n\nIt seemed now that they couldn't be \"collected,\" and besides, they were too weak.\n\nThe terrifying power of that single strike drew gasps from many and, more importantly, ignited the fighting spirit of the other interns.\n\nThe assessment battle had officially begun!!\n\nLu Ding weaved through the horde of monsters at the forefront. Slashing attacks enveloped his body, erupting with every move of his hands and feet. Wood chips flew and limbs scattered as he moved with the unhurried ease of a stroll in the park, demonstrating an elegance unique to the art of violence.\n\nHe reached out, grabbing a Wooden Man by the head.\n\nA flurry of dozens of slashes erupted from his hand.\n\nThe Wooden Man's head instantly disintegrated into a handful of splinters.\n\nHe casually scattered them.\n\nLu Ding just felt the difficulty was too low. These Wooden Men looked terrifying, but their actual combat power wasn't much higher than that of an ordinary person.\n\nThey were just a bit taller, with slightly stronger defense, a little more strength, a bit more speed, and slightly larger numbers.\n\nThat was all.\n\nThey posed no threat to him whatsoever.\n\nWithin ten minutes, the number behind Lu Ding's name on the large screen had soared to over eighty.\n\nThis meant he had already killed more than eighty monsters.\n\nSeeing this terrifying number, the other Intern Investigators who were just there for the show could no longer remain calm.\n\n\"This motherfucker is more of a monster than the monsters! Eighty kills in ten minutes, is he chopping cabbage?!!\"\n\n\"No wonder he's so arrogant! With that kind of strength, he deserves to be arrogant!!!!\"\n\n\"He's probably going to break the record, isn't he? Both for quantity and time. I've never heard of anyone killing eighty monsters in ten minutes during the intern assessment.\"\n\n\"Lu Ding. I'll remember that name. If it's possible in the future, I hope I can go on a mission with him. I'd feel completely safe.\"\n\n\"How many do you guys think he can kill in an hour?\"\n\n\"At least four or five hundred, right?\"\n\n\"I think so too. I wonder if there's a reward for breaking the record.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking? You think this is a novel, where every broken record comes with an extra prize?\"\n\n\"Even if there's no extra reward, this guy has made a name for himself. I reckon there won't be many in Bureau 749 who don't recognize his name after this.\"\n\nLu Ding, in the center of the field, was unaware of the reactions outside.\n\nOn a nearby battlefield, Liu Yun wielded her Demon Blade, weaving between the monsters. With every flash of her blade, a monster turned into points on the large screen.\n\nBut even so, her score was still a long way from Lu Ding's. She had only killed over thirty, while Lu Ding had already killed nearly two hundred.\n\nLiu Yun had originally thought that the gap between herself and the other interns was already quite large, what with her Demon Blade and her powerful Talent.\n\nBut today, the appearance of Lu Ding made her understand what \"there are people beyond people, and heavens beyond the heavens\"¹ truly meant.\n\nThinking of all the compliments and praise she had received these past few days, Liu Yun's face flushed red with shame. She found it all laughable now.\n\nShe cut down another Wooden Man with her blade.\n\nLiu Yun had been here for almost a month, and for the first time, she had an epiphany: she needed to start working harder!\n\n***\n\n¹A Chinese idiom meaning there is always someone better than you.",

    "title": "Chapter 8: The unity of man and nature, full of buffs, one day, one year after another",
    "content": "......\n\nTime was rapidly approaching its end. The word \"assessment\" had lost its meaning for Lu Ding.\n\nNow, he was merely using these wooden dummies to hone his combat experience.\n\nHis skill, Forgetfulness of Form*, had long been activated.\n\nWith the state of Unity of Heaven and Man** empowering him, his slashes flew out, impenetrable and increasingly terrifying in power, with devious angles.\n\nLu Ding's combat experience was rapidly improving.\n\nThis miraculous state of his attracted the attention of the 749 management personnel observing the assessment venue from backstage.\n\n\"Unity of Heaven and Man! This kid actually entered the state of Unity of Heaven and Man!!!\"\n\n\"He opened his apertures yesterday, joined Bureau 749 yesterday, and came to participate in the assessment without even choosing a cultivation technique. Possessing such terrifying combat power was already incredible. Now, he's even entered the state of Unity of Heaven and Man. If he gets a perfect score later, claims an Aperture-Opening Pill, and directly breaks through to the second cultivation stage, Zhaoxuan, and then receives a cultivation technique afterwards!\"\n\n\"Good heavens, this kid has maxed out his buffs!!!!\"\n\n\"If others' combat power is currently one, then this kid is at least thirty. And when his Unity of Heaven and Man enlightenment ends, his innate slashing power will become even stronger, with combat power soaring to a hundred. Then he goes back tonight, claims an Aperture-Opening Pill, directly elevates one major realm, and his combat power reaches a thousand. Add a cultivation technique, and he still has a second unmanifested talent.\"\n\n\"How can anyone else keep up?\"\n\n\"He changes every day. Today, others might still see a glimpse of his back. Tomorrow, when Lu Ding appears again, the others won't even be able to taste his exhaust fumes.\"\n\n\"In just one day, he's walked a path that many wouldn't complete in ten years.\"\n\n\"And yet, he's still an intern investigator.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahahahahaha...\"\n\nIn the observation room, a group of 749 management personnel laughed heartily.\n\nA young fellow whose strength surpassed that of an average official investigator was merely an intern investigator. This was like a high school student attending elementary school.\n\nWasn't that a dimensionality reduction strike?\n\nYet, there was nothing that could be done. The rigid rule was there: ten missions, or ten monsters. This rule was set by the former founder, and no one could change it.\n\nWhen that time came, wouldn't it be like a wolf charging into a flock of sheep, slaughtering indiscriminately?\n\nThinking of this, the management personnel couldn't stop laughing.\n\nAs the assessment concluded.\n\nLu Ding released his Forgetfulness of Form. At this point, his score on the large screen showed an overwhelming lead.\n\nWatching him exit the Unity of Heaven and Man state, those observing felt a bit regretful, wishing it could have lasted longer.\n\nThey didn't know that the Unity of Heaven and Man, a state others yearned for, was something Lu Ding could enter at will.\n\nThe wooden dummies dissipated.\n\nOn the screen, the score breakdown lit up.\n\nLu Ding was the only one with a perfect score. Ten people achieved \"Excellent,\" with Liu Yun among them. Chu Hao, on the other hand, received a \"General\" score.\n\nOriginally, with his usual state, getting an \"Excellent\" score would have been no problem. But because his rattan armor was broken, his defense was not as good as before, and he hadn't deliberately practiced dodging, so he felt rather constrained when fighting.\n\nAt this moment, Chu Hao felt a little ashamed.\n\nHe felt humiliated, but there was nothing he could do.\n\nHe had personally experienced Lu Ding's combat power just now; even from a distance, he could still feel as if he was being cut.\n\nIt was too terrifying, leading him to be unable to harbor even a shred of resentment.\n\nHe could only glance sideways to look, but found that Lu Ding hadn't cast a single glance his way from beginning to end.\n\nHe let out a long breath, feeling desolate in his heart.\n\n\"Yes, to others, I'm just a clown.\"\n\nAs everyone exited, Lu Ding also claimed his reward: an Aperture-Opening Pill.\n\nIt was entirely cyan, sealed with wax inside a small box.\n\nLooking at the Aperture-Opening Pill, the information he had previously seen on the 749 APP flashed through Lu Ding's mind.\n\nThe Aperture-Opening Pill, a special elixir for the Aperture-Opening Stage, was extremely precious. It contained a vast amount of pure and gentle medicinal power, capable of helping Qi Refiners open all their body apertures and directly enter the Zhaoxuan Stage.\n\nThe first cultivation stage, the Aperture-Opening Stage, states that a person's body has three hundred and sixty-five apertures, coinciding with the number of the cosmos. Opening all body apertures coincides with the Dao of Heaven and Earth; this is Aperture-Opening, laying the foundation for cultivation.\n\nAfter Aperture-Opening comes Zhaoxuan, where the three hundred and sixty-five apertures condense into qi vortexes, drawing in spiritual qi from heaven and earth to store within oneself for modulation and to nourish the physical body.\n\nAfter Zhaoxuan is the Spirit Sea, where the three hundred and sixty-five apertures merge and fuse into a sea. Those with resources use heavenly materials and earthly treasures to expand and supplement their Spirit Sea, while those without resources can only rely on slow, steady effort. Once they reach their limit, they can break through the Spirit Sea and enter the Divine Palace Stage.\n\nThese are the three basic stages; only by laying a good foundation can a tall building rise from the ground.\n\nTo master these three stages, comprehension and resources are indispensable.\n\nLu Ding felt fortunate when he saw this; it was a good thing he joined 749, otherwise, where would he find such resources on his own?\n\nNo wonder they say \"poor scholars, rich warriors\"*** and \"Wealth, Techniques, Companions, Land.\"**** If he had to do it all himself, he'd probably be at a loss.\n\nHow could it be as convenient as it was now? He could get an Aperture-Opening Pill to try out without doing anything.\n\nIn the future, he could even use contribution points to exchange for heavenly materials and earthly treasures from 749's inventory for cultivation.\n\nEven going out on missions was for his own benefit, to contain monsters, get rewards, and earn contribution points.\n\nThe decision to join 749 was truly the right one!\n\nSeeing him remain silent for a moment, Deng Guofu, who had liked him ever since he sensed Lu Ding's talent and learned of his work ethic when distributing the rewards, now liked him even more upon seeing him lost in thought, dazed and absent-minded.\n\nHe even gave Lu Ding a flattering label in his heart.\n\nAn innocent heart.\n\nThe smile on Deng Guofu's face was irrepressible: \"Lu Ding, what are you thinking about?\"\n\n\"Nothing, thank you, Leader.\"\n\nLu Ding came back to his senses and thanked him.\n\nThe staff nearby also smiled.\n\n\"This is Head Deng of our 749 Yunhai Branch's Logistics Department.\"\n\nHearing the words \"Logistics Department\" here, one shouldn't underestimate them by thinking they merely handle food, drink, and daily necessities.\n\nIn a cultivation novel, this would be an Elder of the Scripture Storage Pavilion; all cultivation techniques, resources, and elixir exchanges for the Internship Division must pass through their hands.\n\nThey might very well be some big shot.\n\nLu Ding also understood this point and quickly corrected himself: \"Thank you, Head Deng.\"\n\n\"Little comrade learns quickly, hahahahaha,\" Head Deng quipped.\n\nLu Ding echoed his laughter, only feeling that the old man was very gentle, much like the director of the orphanage who raised him.\n\nAnd very much like the grandpa, the director of the community street office, who was about to retire.\n\nThese people had all left a strong mark in his life experiences over the past nineteen years.\n\n\"You haven't chosen a cultivation technique yet, have you?\"\n\nDeng Guofu asked gently.\n\n\"I haven't had time yet. I was planning to go choose after this was over.\"\n\n\"That works out perfectly. I'm also heading back to the Logistics Department. We can go together, and I can give you a little advice.\"\n\nThis advice was no small matter. There were so many cultivation techniques for intern investigators to choose from; if he picked one himself, he might very well choose poorly.\n\nOthers didn't get this treatment. But then, who told Lu Ding to perform so exceptionally?\n\nNot providing appropriate convenience would truly be disheartening.\n\nWithout waiting for things to conclude there, Old Deng led Lu Ding away.\n\nOn the way, the two chatted enthusiastically.\n\nLu Ding also briefly told Old Deng about his experiences over the past nineteen years. The old man patted his shoulder: \"You're a man.\"\n___\n* A state or technique that transcends physical form or self-awareness, allowing for more fluid and powerful actions.\n** A profound state of harmony where one's consciousness merges with the surrounding environment or the cosmos, leading to enhanced abilities and perception.\n*** An idiom suggesting that scholarly pursuits are often less lucrative, while martial arts (or cultivation in this context) require significant financial investment.\n**** An idiom in cultivation settings that highlights the four essential elements for successful cultivation: financial resources, suitable cultivation methods, like-minded allies, and a favorable cultivation environment.",

    "content": "......\n\n\"People my age are all grandfathers by now. If I had any descendants, my grandson would probably be about your age, though I doubt he'd be as promising as you, hahahahahaha,\" Elder Deng lamented.\n\nThe two had arrived in front of a building in the Logistics Division that resembled an open book.\n\nThey walked inside.\n\nA dazzling array of shelves held books of all kinds: cultivation methods, miscellaneous essays, reference materials, and so on.\n\nThe sheer volume was bewildering, making it truly difficult to know what to choose.\n\nLu Ding took a step forward, arriving at the section for Intern Investigator cultivation methods.\n\nHe casually picked up a volume to examine.\n\n*Ape Strike Method*.\n\nMost suitable for those with arms that are different from the ordinary person.\n\nIt emphasizes striking from a distance with long, sweeping motions, and moving with the heart of an ape, seeking to achieve a state of unified focus. That is the path to perfection.\n\nLu Ding glanced at his own arms. Didn't seem quite right for him. Never mind.\n\nHe looked at another book, the *Treasured Tome of Yin Scorching*.\n\nRefine the body with yin fire, plant the seed of yin fire, and imbue one's Qi with yin fire, achieving the ultimate state of yin and softness.\n\nIt sounded pretty good, but there were still so many he hadn't looked at. Better to check out the others first.\n\nSeeing that Lu Ding was hesitating up ahead, unable to pick what he wanted, Deng Guofu walked over and handed him an ancient-looking scroll. \"Take a look at this.\"\n\nLu Ding took it and unrolled it. The marks of time washed over him, and a heaven-shaking roar seemed to echo in his ears.\n\nThe stench of blood filled his nostrils.\n\nA ferocious, giant bear with two wings on its back was pouncing to kill.\n\nLu Ding subconsciously raised a hand to block, only to realize it was just an illusion.\n\nRegardless of what the cultivation method was like, the style points were maxed out.\n\nHe looked again at the drawing on the scroll. The lifelike giant bear, with wings sprouting from its back, was roaring at the sky. Beneath it, the bones of all sorts of exotic beasts were piled up like mountains, and blood flowed in rivers. It was an incredibly savage scene.\n\nLu Ding looked up at Elder Deng.\n\nHe explained with a warm smile, \"This is the *Flying Bear Visualization Scroll*. The one painted on it is the genuine article, the Flying Bear. What it's standing on is the Two-Worlds Mountain, which divides the north and the south. Legend says the Flying Bear is an ancient beast of myth. When it crosses to the north, it is a creature of ill omen, tyrannical in nature, taking pleasure in slaughter and rampaging across the northern lands. When it resides in the south, it is a creature of good fortune, guarding the great mountains and maintaining order in the region.\"\n\n\"A visualization scroll is different from a cultivation method. Everyone can comprehend something different from it, and it will have a northern or southern aspect. The wonders within are profound. Are you interested in giving it a try?\"\n\nWith the offer laid out so plainly, Lu Ding of course understood. This was something special, not comparable to the ordinary cultivation methods sitting on the shelves.\n\nHe rolled up the scroll. \"Then I'll listen to you, sir. I'll choose this one.\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, you're a sharp one. This it is, then. Take it and study it well, there's no rush to return it. It's just collecting dust here anyway. Go on now, get to your training. An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, so don't waste any. Remember, when you visualize this Flying Bear Scroll, use it in conjunction with an Orifice Opening Pill. That way, you can perfectly absorb the medicinal effects.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Director. Then I'll be on my way?\"\n\n\"Go on, go on.\" Deng Guofu waved a hand, shooing him away.\n\nLu Ding gave a bow and left. He, too, was a bit eager to try visualizing this Flying Bear Scroll.\n\nPeople always talked about a tiger gaining wings, but could a bear with wings be any weaker than a tiger?\n\nLu Ding was going to find out exactly what the deal was.\n\nSeeing how polite and clever he was, Deng Guofu nodded in satisfaction.\n\nAt the same time, a doubt arose in his mind.\n\n\"Was his file written incorrectly? What tyranny? He's sensible, smart, and polite. These investigators nowadays, so careless in their work!\"\n\nHe turned and walked toward a deeper set of shelves, tearing off the label from the empty slot.\n\nIt read: *Flying Bear Visualization Scroll, 500 Contribution Points*.\n\n.....\n\nReturning to the two-hundred-square-meter single dormitory assigned to him, Lu Ding spread the *Flying Bear Visualization Scroll* flat on the coffee table.\n\nHe popped an Orifice Opening Pill into his mouth, activated his \"Forgetting Form\" skill, and initiated \"Unity of Heaven and Man\"!!!\n\nWarm currents burst forth from his heart, flowing with his blood throughout his entire body. The *Flying Bear Visualization Scroll* before his eyes also began to undergo a miraculous change.\n\nAtop the highest peak of a great mountain range, the winged bear roared at the sky. The sound pierced the clouds, reverberated between heaven and earth, and shook the mountain forests for five hundred li.¹\n\nFrom the south came the chorus of a hundred beasts, shaking the woods; from the north, dust billowed as ten thousand beasts stampeded.\n\nThe Flying Bear stood on the peak, looked back toward the south, then beat its wings and tore through the northern sky, unleashing a storm of blood.\n\nLu Ding, sitting cross-legged on the sofa, suddenly opened his eyes.\n\nTwo days had passed since he had entered a meditative state visualizing the Flying Bear Scroll.\n\nEvery major acupoint in his body was wide open; he had entered the Zhaoxuan realm.\n\nA tyrannical aura radiated from him, like a tidal wave crashing over the world, annihilating any existence that dared to provoke him.\n\nThis was what Lu Ding had comprehended.\n\nThe *Flying Bear Pounce and Kill Method*.\n\nAn ultimate technique of annihilation, born only to slaughter and destroy everything. The true Qi swirling in his energy vortex carried a tyrannical aura, full of aggression.\n\n\"The Director really picked a good cultivation method for me.\"\n\nThis was a favor, and Lu Ding had to remember it.\n\nHe stood up and stretched his limbs, producing a continuous series of crisp cracking sounds.\n\nHe took out his phone to check the time. Two days had passed.\n\nWith his combat power now greatly increased, it was time to accept his first mission since joining 749!\n\nTaking out his phone, he opened the 749 app. Lu Ding's status had been updated. He refreshed the mission board, and a list of missions with detailed intelligence appeared.\n\nHe scrolled casually and found a title that interested him, tapping on it.\n\n816 Annihilation Case Investigation.\n\n[On August 16th, at Apricot Blossom Community on Long'an Street, a family of six was brutally murdered. The local report states that all victims died from excessive blood loss due to tearing wounds, and all were missing their facial skin. The local department's preliminary assessment attributed the deaths to wild animal bites.\n\nAfter being submitted to 749, an expert inspection of the scene revealed traces of a 'Black Old Granny's' presence. Please uncover the truth and either eliminate or contain the 'Black Old Granny'.]\n\nAccording to the ancient text *Folklore*, this Black Old Granny was also called Great Immortal Black.\n\nIt originated as a guardian deity of a certain northern sect.\n\nLater, the term came to refer to a black fox, black bear, or black snake that, after achieving sentience, shed its physical body. It was an alternate name for such a being after it had undergone corpse liberation to become a spirit.\n\nAmong them, the Black Old Granny transformed from a bear spirit had a habit of gnawing on human faces.\n\nAnd it was done while the person was alive, a live gnawing and tearing, which was extremely cruel.\n\nIt just so happened that Lu Ding was now cultivating the *Flying Bear Pounce and Kill Method*, and the troublemaker was a Black Old Granny that had been liberated from the corpse of a bear spirit.\n\nThey were both bears!\n\nTalk about fate. This was fate.\n\n[Mission Rewards: Team leader receives twenty Contribution Points and a 100,000 yuan bonus. Assistant Investigator receives five Contribution Points and a 50,000 yuan bonus. Capturing the Black Old Granny alive and bringing it back to 749 will earn each person an additional 10,000 yuan and one Contribution Point.]\n\n[Mission Note: It is recommended that the team leader be at the Zhaoxuan realm or above.]\n\nLu Ding had previously glanced at the store in the 749 app. A wooden sword made from a ten-year-old lightning-struck tree, possessing evil-warding properties and a hardness surpassing ordinary steel, sold for only five Contribution Points.\n\nAnd in the 749 app, one Contribution Point could be exchanged for 100,000 yuan. Twenty Contribution Points was equivalent to two million yuan.\n\nAlthough it sounded tempting, only a fool would exchange Contribution Points for money.\n\nSo, by that calculation, twenty Contribution Points was actually quite a lot.\n\nThe only problem was that 749 investigators, whether interns or official ones, had to go on missions in pairs or more, just like the police.\n\nThis was to ensure mutual supervision and to have someone to provide support or send for help in case of special circumstances.\n\nBut right now, Lu Ding was alone, and he hadn't added any other investigators as contacts.\n\nSo he simply posted the mission to the forums.\n\nAnd attached a message.\n\n[Intern Investigator Lu Ding: Looking for an assistant investigator. Quick-witted preferred. I don't need you to have high combat power, just be able to protect yourself and handle miscellaneous tasks.]\n\nSuch an arrogant shout-out instantly attracted a crowd of onlookers.²\n\n[Who's this guy, acting so tough? How come you're not dead yet? Someone who doesn't know any better might think you're an official investigator.]\n\n[Hey bro, maybe you should look at what his ID says.]\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  A *li* (里) is a traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly 500 meters or about a third of a mile.\n2.

    "content": "...\n\n【Haha, then it's all good. Hi, Brother Lu. I wasn't fully awake this morning. Please don't hold it against me. I'll go slap myself a couple of times right now.】\n\nAfter two days of buzz, Lu Ding's name had become known to just about everyone in 749, with the exception of those out on missions who hadn't returned. After all, they had never seen such a ruthless probationary investigator before.\n\nLater, someone dug up some information on Lu Ding and posted it.\n\nWhen they saw that he had joined 749 one day and participated in the assessment the next, the only thing they felt, besides admiration, was that he was a total badass.\n\nSuch terrifying combat strength and talent that left everyone else in the dust—he was an absolute mission pro!\n\nGoing on a mission with him, as long as you were obedient and did whatever he said, the contribution points were basically free for the taking.\n\nAs soon as Lu Ding posted the mission queue, dozens of applications instantly flooded in.\n\nHe clicked on the details and reviewed them one by one.\n\nFinally, he selected a probationary investigator named Yan Feifan.\n\nHe approved the queue and sent a message.\n\n【Do you have a car?】\n\nA car was crucial. Although Lu Ding knew how to drive, that was in his past life. In this life, he hadn't gotten a driver's license yet, nor could he afford a car.\n\nA car?\n\nYan Feifan paused for a moment. He had just been trying his luck; it would be great if he got in, but no big deal if he didn't.\n\nWho knew that Lu Ding would actually approve his request.\n\n【Yes, yes, I have a car. It's tough and durable, a big Jeep, and I'm a very good driver.】\n\n【Alright then. Wait for me at Base Exit A. I'll be there in a bit.】\n\n\"Yes!!\"\n\nIn the four-person dorm, Yan Feifan let out a cheer. The probationary investigator in the next bunk grabbed a pillow and threw it at him.\n\n\"What the hell are you yelling about?!\"\n\n\"Are you trying to keep people from sleeping?!\"\n\nYan Feifan ducked his head. \"Sorry, sorry, I'm heading out right now.\"\n\n\"Get out!!\"\n\nHe put on his shoes and socks and walked out the main door. After carefully pulling the door shut, the smile returned to his face.\n\nHis steps became light and cheerful as he walked away.\n\nHe started the car, humming a tune as he drove all the way to Exit A. There, he saw a man standing by the side of the road with his arms crossed. His clothes were unremarkable, handsome purely on the strength of his looks. His stance alone exuded the air of a powerful expert.\n\nYan Feifan parked the car, got out of the driver's side, and opened the passenger door.\n\n\"Brother Lu, I'm Yan Feifan.\"\n\nLu Ding got into the passenger seat. Only then did Yan Feifan walk around to the driver's seat, twist open a bottle of mineral water, and hand it to Lu Ding. \"Brother Lu, what's our next move? I took a look at the mission details on the way here.\"\n\n\"It says there are three main suspects in this case.\"\n\n\"First, Tong Yong, twenty-one, male, a third-year student at Yunhai Computer Vocational College. Years ago, his family were neighbors with the deceased's family in Yangjiao'ao Village. When he was young, Tong Yong's father got into a fight with the deceased's family but lost. A few years later, Tong Yong's father died, so he's somewhat of a suspect.\"\n\n\"Second, Zhao Haichuan, fifty-two, the ex-husband of one of the deceased, Wu Daoxiang. He was imprisoned years ago for drug use, after which Wu Daoxiang divorced him and remarried Zhou Shenghua. After being released from prison, Zhao Haichuan would periodically harass the deceased's family, demanding that Wu Daoxiang compensate him.\"\n\n\"Third, Fan Wurei, twenty-four, the ex-boyfriend of one of the deceased, Zhou Lian. He's a junior employee at an auto repair shop. Zhou Lian's father disapproved of them being together and even beat Fan Wurei during that time.\"\n\n\"Besides these individuals, the deceased's family hadn't had conflicts with anyone else. They were fairly honest people.\"\n\nNot bad. This was the kind of auxiliary investigator Lu Ding wanted—savvy, reads the mission details in advance, and smart.\n\nHe leaned back in his seat and took a sip of water. \"Tell me your thoughts.\"\n\n\"It's like this, Brother Lu. I used the process of elimination in my head, and I think Tong Yong is the most suspicious. First, Fan Wurei. The local investigation files show that he comes from a harmonious family, but he just doesn't listen to his parents much, which is why he ended up working at his uncle's auto repair shop instead of going to university.\"\n\n\"He's been knocking around in the real world for years and is still just a junior employee. It's impossible that he would have the guts to kill someone, let alone wipe out a whole family. Besides, he and Zhou Lian genuinely liked each other; they were together for three years.\"\n\n\"So his suspicion level is almost zero. At most, he's just resentful.\"\n\n\"As for Zhao Haichuan, although he harassed the deceased's family many times, no major conflict ever broke out. The deceased's family didn't want to provoke him at all and kept avoiding him. They gave him some money in between, but the guy would take the money and then go back on his word. He's only after money. Murdering a whole family is too big a risk for him.\"\n\n\"Finally, Tong Yong. The local investigation report shows that he's very quiet and honest at school, a loner with few friends, and his academic performance is decent. In his last year of high school, he got into a fight and nearly killed someone, which is what kept him from getting into a university.\"\n\n\"From this, we can see that although Tong Yong is young and seems honest, he's actually a very ruthless character.\"\n\n\"Combined with the involvement of the Old Lady in Black, first, Zhao Haichuan is too old. Even if the Old Lady in Black were to possess someone or use a medium, she wouldn't pick him. Plus, when the investigators went to find him, the old bastard was still energetically visiting prostitutes. He's in custody now.\"\n\n\"That only leaves Fan Wurei and Tong Yong, the two young men. Even if they were possessed or channeled a spirit, it wouldn't leave any major side effects.\"\n\n\"During channeling and possession, although the Old Lady in Black's consciousness would be dominant, the medium himself would retain some awareness. Fan Wurei and Zhou Lian were truly in love; how could he have been so brutal to Zhou Lian? Of course, other possibilities can't be ruled out, but in a side-by-side comparison, Tong Yong's suspicion is the highest!\"\n\nYan Feifan finished his entire speech in one breath. He picked up his water bottle, took a drink, and looked at Lu Ding with a hopeful gaze.\n\nSeeing Lu Ding nod, he continued, \"Then let's go find this Tong Yong. If the Old Lady in Black really has possessed him or has some connection to him, I can smell it.\"\n\nThe Feixiong, after all, was a vicious beast that took pleasure in torturing and killing other aberrations and monsters. Scenting out monsters was one of its signature skills.\n\nLu Ding could tell if someone was normal with a single sniff.\n\nHis original plan had been to visit the three suspects one by one.\n\nNow, with Yan Feifan's analysis, it seemed possible he could save some time and get straight to the heart of the matter.\n\nHaving gotten Lu Ding's approval, Yan Feifan stomped on the accelerator.\n\nOn the road.\n\nYan Feifan kept stealing glances at Lu Ding, a feeling of unreality washing over him. He couldn't believe he was actually on a mission with someone like this.\n\nLu Ding noticed his glances.\n\nHe was the first to break the silence. \"What did you do before this? Your analysis is very clear and logical.\"\n\n\"I was just a student. I just love watching movies, that's all. I've watched tons and tons of movies and documentaries since I was a kid. It's my only hobby. Even though movies are fake, a lot of things in them can be applied to reality.\"\n\nYan Feifan said, a little embarrassed.\n\nIt did sound a bit far-fetched.\n\nBut Lu Ding's interest was piqued. In his past life, he remembered a movie called *Misjudgment*, where the protagonist loved watching movies. When his daughter and wife accidentally killed the son of a powerful official, the protagonist managed to orchestrate everything perfectly, even bringing down the official.\n\nIf it weren't for the need to pass the censors at the end, the protagonist would have never been caught.\n\nHe hadn't expected that the auxiliary investigator he'd casually recruited would actually be such a talent.\n\n\"So what's your talent?\"",

    "content": "Speaking of which, Yan Feifan scratched his forehead and said with a slight lack of confidence, \"Hmm... wall-phasing.\"\n\n\"Wall-phasing?\"\n\nLu Ding found it a bit interesting: \"How did you awaken such a talent?\"\n\n\"Well, when I was at home before, I encountered a paranormal event. I was eaten by the wall, and then I wanted to run, to escape. Then, by accident, I drilled out, and that's how I awakened the talent of wall-phasing.\"\n\nYan Feifan said this while driving.\n\n\"Since you can phase through walls, can you phase through the ground?\"\n\n\"I can, but I can't swim, so I'd sink.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahahaha.\"\n\nLu Ding's laughter echoed in the car.\n\nYan Feifan quickly said, \"I'm afraid of water. I almost drowned when I was little, but I'll learn.\"\n\n\"Alright, perform well. Remember to learn to swim, and I'll call you for the next mission.\"\n\nThe promise Lu Ding made instantly brightened Yan Feifan's eyes!\n\nCompared to finding others, Lu Ding felt that Yan Feifan was good.\n\nMainly, his personality—a bit cowardly yet smart—meant he wouldn't have too many of his own ideas.\n\nHe could be used for odd jobs with peace of mind.\n\nAnd he could also wall-phase and earth-phase; he might be very useful later.\n\n\"Really, Brother Lu? I'm actually quite useless. I'm bad at combat, bad at reconnaissance, bad at everything. I even passed the assessment by exploiting loopholes.\"\n\n\"That means you're smart, right? And when you're on a mission with me, will you need to fight?\"\n\n\"If I need you to step up, then it's likely neither of us will escape.\"\n\nYan Feifan thought for a moment; it seemed to be true.\n\nSoon, the two arrived at a milk tea shop located at a crossroads. Yan Feifan said, \"Brother Lu, we're here. This is where Dong Yong worked his summer job.\"\n\nThe two got out of the jeep, Yan Feifan leading the way. The moment they stepped into the milk tea shop, a faint fishy stench went straight into Lu Ding's nose.\n\nYan Feifan, who was ahead, saw no sign of Dong Yong in the milk tea shop.\n\nAfter ordering two hand-shaken lemon teas, he seized the opportunity to ask, \"Hey, miss, where's the guy who used to work here? I saw him putting a lot of effort into making lemon tea last time. Why isn't he here today? It must be tiring for a girl like you to make it alone.\"\n\nWhat defines a smart person? This is it.\n\nThere were few people in the shop to begin with, and hand-shaken lemon tea was a laborious task.\n\nIf he asked directly, he wouldn't know their relationship, and there might be concealment.\n\nBut now, he threw out a contradiction.\n\nThe staff member making the lemon tea immediately said irritably, \"You mean Dong Yong, right? He quit. He was supposed to give half a month's notice, but he just resigned yesterday and left on the spot. Now I'm the only one in the shop, making milk tea and taking orders. It's so annoying!!\"\n\nAs she spoke, the young woman's hand tightened its grip on the lemons, as if she wanted to vent all her resentment on them.\n\nYan Feifan followed up, \"Hey, this person really lacks consideration, not following any rules or regulations. How could he bear to let such a pretty girl get so tired? I'll treat you to a milk tea to cool off, it's on me.\"\n\nBefore the girl could speak, Yan Feifan paid for an extra milk tea.\n\nHearing the payment sound, the girl felt a bit embarrassed.\n\n\"No, no, it's fine. Our shop has a rule against accepting things ordered by customers.\"\n\n\"It's fine, it's just a cup of milk tea. You're so pretty, even if you can't drink it at work, someone will probably be eager to treat you to one after work. It's just that young man, what's-his-name, Dong Yong, doesn't understand the principle of 'one near water gets the moon first'.\"¹\n\nYan Feifan was already good-looking. Coupled with the good timing and his pleasant words, the girl's face instantly flushed.\n\nFollowing the topic he led, the girl continued to chat.\n\n\"How could that be? He wouldn't even notice me. Yesterday, when he left, I inadvertently saw him chatting with a great beauty. Soon after, a car picked him up, and it was a sports car. I originally thought he was just like me, here to work, but who knew he was a rich young master experiencing life.\"\n\nAfter the two hand-shaken lemon teas were ready, the staff member looked at Yan Feifan with a hopeful expression, her gaze also couldn't help but dart towards Lu Ding beside him.\n\nOne was pleasant to talk to, with a refined and enduring appearance, while the other hadn't said a word, relying solely on his striking handsomeness. Standing anywhere, he was more exquisite and charismatic than a model on TV.\n\nShe had originally thought that this good-looking guy, who spoke so nicely and had treated her to milk tea, would at least ask for her contact information.\n\nBut who knew he would turn around and leave, only busy with his phone.\n\nOnce in the car, Yan Feifan looked at his phone and read, \"Brother Lu, I had the bureau's mission support check the surveillance footage of this road section, and also the car that picked up Dong Yong that day.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding truly felt that recruiting Yan Feifan as an assistant investigator was an incredibly correct choice.\n\nHe was too good at handling things.\n\nHe didn't even need to speak; the other person could anticipate his requirements, then quickly and efficiently complete them and show him the results.\n\nThis feeling was simply too comfortable.\n\n\"Did you find anything?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\nLu Ding didn't even need to look for himself; he just listened as Yan Feifan said, \"The footage shows that yesterday morning, Dong Yong got into a black sports car. This sports car is registered under the Ji Group's name. After comparing with road surveillance footage, the person driving that car yesterday was the Ji Group's eldest daughter, Ji Feiyu.\"\n\n\"The Skynet System captured Ji Feiyu and Dong Yong meeting on Old Mountain Goods Street on August 17th.\"\n\n\"Additional information states that Ji Feiyu has a younger sister, Ji Yanshuang, who seems to have attracted something unclean. Hospital examinations were normal, but later they consulted a traditional Chinese medicine doctor who said her Yang energy was deficient, and she has been taking medicine. And in the mountain goods market, some wild 'good medicines' explicitly prohibited by the state occasionally appear.\"\n\n\"And many other miscellaneous things.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, the data also states that on August 18th, the day the Apricot Blossom Residential Area massacre was discovered, Dong Yong was summoned as a suspect. Shortly after he arrived, Ji Feiyu came to bail him out. Since he had an alibi, the local authorities didn't make things difficult for him.\"\n\nHearing all this, Lu Ding once again experienced the terrifying power of the state apparatus. How much time had passed? They could investigate eighteen generations of ancestors for you.\n\nYan Feifan, beside him, grew more and more excited as he spoke: \"And today, Ji Hong, the chairman of the Ji Group, even invited a Chuma disciple with real abilities to come and perform a ritual for Ji Yanshuang. Good heavens, Brother Lu, I have something to say, but I don't know if I should.\"\n\n\"Say it,\" Lu Ding said calmly.\n\n\"This Dong Yong is simply the template for an urban paranormal novel's protagonist.\"\n\n\"If Dong Yong truly has the Black Old Lady with him, then when he met Ji Feiyu, he would definitely be able to tell what Ji Feiyu had been exposed to by living with Ji Yanshuang. Following the plot of a novel, Dong Yong would certainly point it out.\"\n\n\"Later, when Dong Yong was summoned, she went to bail him out. Reaching this point shows that Ji Feiyu has started to take Dong Yong's words seriously. Following the cliche plot, Ji Feiyu must want Dong Yong to help drive away whatever is on her sister.\"\n\n\"And today, another Chuma disciple has arrived, and one with real abilities at that. When Dong Yong makes his move, how could the immortal spirits carried by ordinary Chuma disciples compare to the Black Old Lady carried by Dong Yong? At that point, it'll just be showing off and putting them in their place.\"\n\n---\n¹ Literally \"a pavilion near the water gets the moon first\"; this idiom refers to benefiting from being in a favorable position.",

    "content": "「Dong Yong could also use this *chuma* disciple to learn some secrets of the Qi Refiners, thoroughly stepping into the world of Qi Refiners. Moreover, he could get a large sum of money and connections from the Ji family, using these connections to make a name for himself. In the future, if any rich person encountered something, he could come forward to deal with their issues and obtain a large amount of money.\n\nHe could live a better life, and even because he saved Ji Yanshuang, he might even gain the favor of the two sisters.」\n\n「After all, the attraction of Qi Refiners to ordinary people is deadly; their very existence is on a different level.」\n\n「This brat really deserves to die, sister flowers!!!」\n\nLu Ding gave him a strange look after listening.\n\nYou know what, you're really not wrong, it actually sounds like that.\n\nYan Feifan subconsciously scratched his head. This was due to his inner embarrassment, as well as the inferiority complex he had developed over a long time, accustomed to using small gestures to distract others.\n\n「I... I saw that urban supernatural novels from a few years ago all wrote it like this. This is too similar, that's why I said it. Brother Lu, do you think I'm crazy?」\n\nLu Ding shook his head slightly: 「I think you're a goddamn genius for thinking of this.」\n\nYan Feifan, having received praise, squinted his eyes: 「No, no, it's just that this kind of plot is too cliché, I just thought of it right away. And it's unreasonable. This kid probably read too many novels and just followed the steps in them.」\n\n「If things really develop according to this scenario, even if you don't take this mission, Brother Lu, he'll still be noticed by 749. He won't be able to escape then. Simply put, he's gotten too cocky. He also didn't think carefully. Since these things appear among the populace, how could the country not have countermeasures and corresponding departments?」\n\n「Since that's the case, let's go watch some real-life showboating and face-slapping. When he's at his most smug, I'll make my move and take him down in one go!!」\n\nLu Ding also developed a mischievous streak.\n\nMany unrealistic ideas are always brutally beaten by real life.\n\nJust like this Dong Yong.\n\nHe committed a crime and still dares to swagger around, not even running away. This is too arrogant.\n\nAnd there might even be a \"sister flowers\" plotline. Lu Ding felt this was very unreasonable.\n\nYan Feifan stomped on the gas pedal, a mischievous grin appearing on his face.\n\n「Hehehe, Brother Lu, you're too wicked.」\n\nSuddenly, he seemed to realize he had said something wrong and quickly corrected himself: 「No, no, Brother Lu, I mean you're very handsome and charming, like those big villains with maxed-out coolness, strategizing behind the scenes, striking down idiotic protagonists.」\n\n「Then aren't you the 'dog-headed' strategist devising schemes beside the big villain?」\n\nYan Feifan was startled, seeing that Lu Ding was not only not angry but also joking with him.\n\nThe smile he had suppressed reappeared: 「Then I should laugh like this.」\n\n「Hee hee hee hee.......」\n\n「Hahahahahahaha, what the hell kind of sound is that? Stop it, it's giving me goosebumps.」\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side.\n\nInside the Ji family's villa, a man and a woman stood facing each other.\n\nThe man, dressed in white, with a refined appearance, was Lu Ding's target: Dong Yong.\n\nOriginally, Dong Yong was just an ordinary person, but after Black Old Madam established a connection with him, the spiritual qi of heaven and earth entered his body and cleansed him. Even the ugliest person wouldn't look too ugly.\n\nMoreover, after becoming a Qi Refiner, his status and level were different from ordinary people.\n\nThat surge of confidence emerged, improving his demeanor and mental outlook, naturally making him handsome.\n\nStanding opposite him was Bai Xiaoxiao, the *chuma* disciple invited by Ji Hong, the chairman of Ji Group.\n\nThey were both here to do a job; they were peers.\n\nRivals in the same field are like enemies; how could the atmosphere between them be good?\n\nBai Xiaoxiao said curtly: 「Chairman Ji, what is the meaning of this? Inviting me wasn't enough, and you had to get 'insurance'? Are you implying you don't trust the methods of my Bai family?」\n\nFox, Weasel, Hedgehog, Snake, Rat – the Northern Five Immortals¹.\n\nAmong the *chuma* halls, the Fox family is the greatest. Their origins are deep, their background complex. If a Fox family spirit presides over a hall, it means they have strong backing, and people generally have to show them respect wherever they go. They are all-rounders, knowing a bit of everything.\n\nThe Yellow family (Weasel) is known for illusions, often holding the position of marshal in the halls.\n\nThe White family (Hedgehog) specializes in healing and saving lives.\n\nThe Willow family (Snake) commands troops and is the strongest in combat.\n\nThe Gray family (Rat) specializes in seeking good fortune and avoiding disaster.\n\nThese are their signature skills.\n\nJi Hong looked a bit troubled: 「Miss Bai, it's not that I don't trust you. It's just that my daughter didn't know I would invite you, so she invited this young man. I am truly sorry.」\n\nHe looked apologetically at Dong Yong: 「Young Mr. Dong, I'm truly sorry about today's matter. Here's five hundred thousand, please take a look.」\n\nDong Yong did not take the five hundred thousand. He said indifferently: 「I won't accept money if I haven't done anything. I can leave, but if you want to invite me again later, the price won't be this.」\n\n「Are you implying that I can't cure Second Miss Ji!?」\n\nBai Xiaoxiao questioned with a frown.\n\nDong Yong sneered: 「Just you? A wet-behind-the-ears little girl. Why don't you go back and cultivate for a few more years before you come again? The immortal spirit you channel cannot cure Miss Ji's illness.」\n\nInside the jeep not far from the villa.\n\nYan Feifan held a bronze mirror, which was playing the scene unfolding inside the villa.\n\nSeeing Dong Yong show off so much, Yan Feifan couldn't help but complain: 「Brother Lu, look, this guy is really showing off now! And 'wet behind the ears' – at least he knows how to use an idiom now. He might not even be older than her! He acts all wise and experienced, constantly sneering. Who knows which novel he learned that from? He really looks like he needs a beating!!」\n\n「If you really have the ability, and she dares to provoke you, then deal with her! If you don't have the ability, then don't show off, don't try to pull that 'initial setback, glorious comeback' stunt here.」\n\nLu Ding also thought this person was showing off a bit too much, even more than himself. Anyone who didn't know would think he was amazing.\n\nHowever, Lu Ding's focus wasn't on this.\n\n「Where did you get this mirror? It's quite magical.」\n\n「This is a small magical artifact I exchanged with contribution points. It's not very useful, it can only monitor the surrounding situation. If someone's strength is much higher than mine, I'll even be discovered. It's mainly used to protect my personal safety during missions. If there's any problem, I'll just run through walls and escape.」\n\nHe's really scared of death.\n\nAfter hearing that its function was very limited, Lu Ding instantly lost interest.\n\nHe continued watching the scene.\n\nThe conflict between the two had reached its final stage.\n\nJust then, Bai Xiaoxiao said in the scene: 「Fine!!」\n\n「Since you said I'm not qualified, then let's compete to see who can cure Second Miss's illness. If I cure her, you'll crawl out of here. If I can't cure her, you can ask for anything you want.」\n\nAt the same time, outside the main entrance, the sound of high heels echoed.\n\nA woman in a long bodycon dress entered the frame. Her curvaceous figure, combined with this outfit and frameless glasses, added a touch of allure.\n\nThe moment she appeared, she attracted everyone's attention.\n\nIt was then that Dong Yong changed to putting both hands in his pockets: 「Alright, I agree to your proposal. Ladies first. I'll let you go first.」\n\n「Oh my god!!!!! Brother Lu!!!! Can we go in right now and punch him to death? What he said is giving me goosebumps, it's so cringe! And 'ladies first' – he's like a peacock fanning its tail, eager to show off his p-hole². I'm really fed up!!」\n\n「Damn it, I can't take it anymore!!」\n\nHe had originally wanted to just watch the show, but who knew Dong Yong would pull a stunt like this? Lu Ding's toes were curling up tight.\n\nThe two of them pulled open the car doors, one on the left and one on the right, got out of the car, and charged straight into the villa.\n\n---\n¹ The Northern Five Immortals (北方五仙) refer to five animal spirits (fox, weasel, hedgehog, snake, and rat) revered in Northeastern Chinese folk religion, each associated with specific powers and roles.\n² A highly vulgar slang term for the anus.",

    "title": "Chapter 13: Tearing Dong Yong with his hands and hiding the black old lady",
    "content": "Inside the villa, listening to their conversation.\n\nJi Feiyu felt a touch of impatience. Although they were both capable extraordinary individuals, to use her sister's illness as a standard to determine the outcome of a wager truly left a bad taste in her mouth. Her attitude towards Dong Yong had already been very good. And she had promised a hefty sum of money if her sister's illness could be cured. Now, what was this about?\n\nBut even with her displeasure, Ji Feiyu didn't voice it. Her sister's illness had dragged on for too long, and now their only hope rested on these two. Her gaze turned to her father, seeing the anger also surface on his face. Ji Feiyu sighed, \"Gentlemen, perhaps we should begin now.\"\n\nDong Yong took a hand out of his pocket, extended it forward, and said calmly, \"Please!\"\n\nBANG!!!!\n\nWith a thunderous crash, the wall behind him instantly shattered as a figure smashed through it. In the blur, those present seemed to see a ferocious, bear-shaped beast with wings on its back lunging towards them.\n\nLu Ding stretched out his large hand, and in a flash, directly grabbed Dong Yong's neck, lifted him, slammed him onto the ground, shattering expensive flooring, then lifted him again and held him in the air.\n\n\"Please your mother? Do you really not know how to write the word 'embarrassment'? I was listening outside, and my toes were curling. Do you think you're particularly stylish?!\"\n\nBlood gushed from his nose and mouth. Although Lu Ding had held back a significant amount of strength in that last move, it was still enough to instantly incapacitate Dong Yong.\n\n\"Cough cough cough... Wh-who are you?\"\n\n\"Who am I? I'm here to send you to meet King Yama. Dong Yong, your secret's out. Tell the Black Old Lady inside you to come out.\"\n\nThe Black Old Lady's screams in Dong Yong's mind were incessant.\n\n\"No!! No!!! I don't want to come out!!! I don't want to come out!! Flying Bear!! He's a Flying Bear!!!\"\n\nThe Black Old Lady inside Dong Yong was also a bear spirit, and had lived for many years, but its talent wasn't great. It had reached the end of its cultivation path, which was why it abandoned its physical body and sought other methods. Let alone the fact that she currently had no physical body; even if she did, facing Lu Ding, who practiced the Flying Bear Slaughtering Method, she would only be instantly killed and torn to shreds. Considering it, the Flying Bear was like the ancestor of her ancestor's ancestor. And it was a ferocious entity that took pleasure in torture and slaughter. It would be strange if this Black Old Lady dared to come out.\n\nIt was also Dong Yong's first time seeing the arrogant Black Old Lady lose control to such an extent. Fear grew rampant within him like wild grass. All his confidence stemmed from the Black Old Lady. Ever since he unintentionally allowed the Black Old Lady to enter his body, Dong Yong had felt like he was the protagonist of this world, just like the protagonists in novels; he was also the protagonist of this realm. Furthermore, the Black Old Lady had constantly bragged to him about how powerful she was. Dong Yong had also come to see the Black Old Lady as his personal pocket grandpa¹. It was also because of this sudden swelling of ego that Dong Yong thought of the Zhou family, with whom his father had fought in previous years. Coupled with the Black Old Lady's constant instigation from the sidelines, Dong Yong, in a moment of impulse, killed all six members of the Zhou family. He had thought he was flawless, leaving no trace. Who knew that today, someone would come knocking on his door?\n\n\"I... I surrender... Pl-please don't kill me...\"\n\nLu Ding smiled. Yan Feifan stood beside him and said, \"Idiot, what were you doing earlier? Swaggering around, flaunting your power, and even coming here to cure illnesses and exorcise evil, and now you want to surrender?\"\n\n\"Lu Ge, what's your opinion?\"\n\n\"Too late!\" Lu Ding's voice rang out. \"I gave you a dignified chance. Since you weren't obedient, then this is how we'll play.\"\n\nUnder the terrified gazes of everyone present, Dong Yong's body was torn into two halves in Lu Ding's hands. Blood sprayed. A puff of black smoke flew out from the corpse, transforming into a massive black bear that fled outwards: \"Flying Bear!!! Flying Bear!!!! I won't dare again, I won't dare again, don't kill me, don't kill me.\"\n\nLu Ding raised his palm, and a gentle breeze swept through the room.\n\n\"Shatter.\"\n\nHis voice was not loud, yet everyone heard it with unusual clarity. The fleeing black bear was instantly sliced into countless tiny fragments and dispersed into the air. Not even a final scream was left behind.\n\nA completion notification sounded in Lu Ding's ear.\n\n[Monster Contained: Black Old Lady]\n[Containment Reward: Bear-Boar Strength]\n[Bear-Boar Strength: Strength of a thousand jun, palm can push mountains]\n\nLu Ding looked at the reward, calculating in his mind: A thousand jun of strength. One jun is thirty jin², so a thousand jun is thirty thousand jin. Although this kind of power appearing in a human body was terrifying, if you carefully converted it, a rural tractor could pull two Ruyi Jingu Bangs. Never mind, just make do with it. Every little bit counts.\n\nIt was a good thing Lu Ding's internal thoughts weren't heard by others; if those Qi Refiners who specialized in physical cultivation heard it, they'd probably die of anger.\n\n\"You're comparing humans to tractors!?\"\n\n\"Can that be the same? Thirty thousand jin of strength—do you know how many years of cultivation, how many rare treasures, and what kind of talent it takes to possess that!?\"\n\nYan Feifan stepped forward and offered a handkerchief with both hands. Lu Ding took it and wiped his hands. Yan Feifan then took out a confidentiality agreement and walked towards the three people who were already petrified, squinting his eyes as he spoke: \"This is 749 business. Please sign this confidentiality agreement. You must not disclose today's events, or you will bear legal responsibility, direct arrest, and no bail, okay?\"\n\n\"Chairman Ji, please rest assured. For your losses today, a specialist will contact you to discuss compensation. We guarantee your satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Ah!!!!\"\n\nYan Feifan's voice startled the dazed Bai Xiaoxiao awake. A piercing scream echoed through the villa. The next second,\n\n\"Scream again, and I'll tear you apart too.\"\n\nBai Xiaoxiao instantly shut up. Her face was pale, and her hands trembled as she covered her mouth. Although she was also a Qi Refiner and knew of, even seen, people from 749, she had never seen a 749 investigator so ruthless and brutal. She asked incredulously, \"You... You 749... aren't you supposed to contain and confine them?\"\n\n\"Contain and confine?\"\n\n\"If I contain and confine them, where would my rewards come from? Just for a few extra contribution points and tens of thousands of yuan? Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?\" One of Lu Ding's original intentions for joining 749 was to use 749's information to help him find, kill, and absorb monsters. How could he possibly capture them alive?\n\n\"You might be talking about someone else. I'm different. I don't like leaving them alive.\"\n\nGulp.\n\nBai Xiaoxiao swallowed hard. Her gaze flickered towards Lu Ding, and when she saw his eyes turn her way, she quickly lowered her head, afraid to meet his gaze.\n\n\"Th-this... Sir?\" Ji Hong, after all, was a chairman who had weathered many storms. Although he was also afraid and terrified, he managed to regain a bit of his ability to think.\n\n\"No need to call me 'Sir.' I might think it's ancient times. My surname is Lu, just call me Investigator Lu.\"\n\n\"Investigator Lu, could you perhaps erase my daughter's memory of this incident, just like in the movies?\"\n\nJi Feiyu, who was nearby, was already frozen in place, her face pale, her eyes vacant, unable to recover for a long time. Lu Ding nodded towards Yan Feifan. 749 did indeed have such methods, and they were distributed for missions, but with strict control standards. Their use required video recording, and they couldn't be used by just one person; at least two investigators had to use them together. If there were any procedural irregularities, it would result in immediate apprehension!!!\n\nSeeing Yan Feifan approach her with a small, elongated object, Ji Feiyu instantly snapped back to her senses, extending both hands to block her face: \"No... *gag*... *gag*... Don't erase my memory *gag*...\"\n\n---\n¹A \"pocket grandpa\" (隨身老爺爺) is a common trope in Chinese web novels where a powerful, often ancient, mentor or spirit resides within the protagonist's body or an item, offering guidance and knowledge.\n²A `jun` (鈞) is a traditional Chinese unit of weight, equal to 30 `jin` (斤).

He still needed to return to the agency and submit his mission report.\n\nJust then, Ji Hong called out, stopping him.\n\n\"Investigator Lu, could you please wait a moment? I don't need compensation; I just hope you can wait a little longer before you go, alright?\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll wait a bit then.\"\n\nNot needing compensation was, of course, the best outcome. Every investigator had a compensation quota. For an intern investigator, it was five million a month. Once that was used up, a different set of standards applied.\n\nThis was also to prevent some investigators from relying on state compensation to act with grand, sweeping moves, turning into mobile artillery platforms, bombarding indiscriminately, the moment they engaged.\n\nSo, saving a little was saving a little.\n\nSeeing Lu Ding agree, Ji Hong turned back to Bai Xiaoxiao: \"Miss Bai, can you treat my daughter now?\"\n\n\"C-can I...?\"\n\nWhen Bai Xiaoxiao said this, her gaze was fixed on Lu Ding.\n\n\"Why are you looking at me? Someone's asking you to treat an illness, so treat it.\"\n\n\"Oh oh oh, yes yes, I can, I'll treat her, right now! Where is the second young lady?\"\n\nJi Hong led the way: \"This way.\"\n\nAs the two left, only Lu Ding and two others remained in the living room.\n\nJi Feiyu leaned weakly against the sofa, turning her head to watch Lu Ding, who had pulled up a chair and sat down.\n\nNext to him, Yan Feifan stood respectfully.\n\nShe didn't know where she found the courage, but her eyes were fixed straight on Lu Ding, gradually lost in thought.\n\nYan Feifan leaned close, whispering in his ear: \"Brother Lu, she's probably got a bit of Stockholm Syndrome. Plus, Brother Lu, you're handsome, and your methods just now were quite brutal. She might also have certain inclinations, so she might be a little interested in you.\"\n\nHer gaze was too unrestrained, so Lu Ding spoke up: \"Am I good-looking?\"\n\nJi Feiyu subconsciously nodded, then quickly shook her head.\n\nSuddenly, a surge of coldness arrived, accompanied by sharp roars.\n\n\"Junior of the Bai family, you are not worthy of breaking my spell!\"\n\nLu Ding shot up. Another monster?!\n\nHe couldn't stand anyone being arrogant in front of him. He wanted to see what was going on.\n\nInside Ji Yanshuang's room.\n\nBlack mist billowed, and a semi-illusory white-clad female ghost floated within it.\n\nBai Xiaoxiao shivered. She had never expected that the malevolent entity Ji Family's Second Young Lady had provoked would be so ferocious.\n\nShe truly couldn't exorcise this 'evil' herself.\n\nBang!!!\n\nThe same sound, the same entrance.\n\nThe room door was directly shattered, and several sharp slashes cut into the black mist, eliciting cries of agony.\n\n\"Come!!! You come and see if you can break my spell!!!\"\n\nWithin the black mist, the female ghost, her face twisted and her eyes bleeding, stared at Lu Ding, who had burst through the door.\n\nSeeing the emblem on his chest, the female ghost snarled: \"749!!!!\"\n\nHundreds of slashes were delivered, completely omitting whatever Lu Ding was about to say next, and the black mist instantly dispersed.\n\n\"I've memorized your aura. I will come looking for you.\"\n\nThe female ghost dissipated with the black mist.\n\nLu Ding's face instantly darkened.\n\nBeing targeted by a ghost?\n\nThat was not a good thing.\n\nOne can be a thief for a thousand days, but one cannot guard against a thief for a thousand days.¹\n\nOn the bed, as the malevolent ghost that had been缠绕 Ji Yanshuang dissipated, her eyelids twitched, showing signs of opening.\n\nLu Ding stepped forward.\n\nThe moment Ji Yanshuang opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was Lu Ding's face.\n\nA sense of security enveloped her, while the clashing gazes brought with them a brutal sense of invasion and oppression.\n\n\"Where did you encounter that ghostly thing just now?\"\n\nThough newly awakened and still a little disoriented, Ji Yanshuang understood what Lu Ding was asking.\n\nThat female ghost had tormented her in her dreams for a long time.\n\nIt felt as if a lifetime had passed.\n\nAfter a good while, Ji Yanshuang said: \"Baiyao Ancient Town. Yes, Baiyao Ancient Town. I went there to see Baiyao porcelain, and then when I came back, I dreamt of her.\"\n\nBaiyao Ancient Town!\n\nLu Ding committed that name to memory.\n\n\"Yan Feifan, check if there are any missions related to Baiyao Ancient Town.\"\n\nRather than waiting for someone to come knocking, it was better to go directly to them and catch them off guard, tearing their souls to shreds.\n\nOf course, even if there was no mission, Lu Ding would still go. He didn't want to be constantly watched from the shadows.\n\nHaving a mission would make things more convenient; he could complete the task along the way, treating it as an expenses-paid trip. If anything got broken, the government would pay for it.\n\nYan Feifan immediately understood Lu Ding's intention.\n\nHe picked up his phone and started checking.\n\nAfter searching for a long time, Yan Feifan shook his head: \"Brother Lu, I didn't find anything.\"\n\nLu Ding frowned. It seemed he would have to make this trip himself.\n\n\"If there isn't one, then so be it. Let's head back to the agency first.\"\n\nLu Ding turned to leave. Ji Hong called out: \"Investigator Lu? Why not stay for a simple meal before you go? It won't take much of your time.\"\n\nLu Ding refused: \"No need.\"\n\nHe needed to return quickly to submit his mission report, then head to Baiyao Ancient Town.\n\nHow dare they threaten him!!\n\nHis Golden Finger,² which he'd held back for almost twenty years, had finally awakened, and they dared to threaten him!\n\nHe wouldn't humor anyone.\n\nJi Hong escorted Lu Ding and Yan Feifan to the door, watching their vehicle drive away.\n\nJi Yanshuang had, at some point, moved to the living room.\n\nSeeing the room full of bloodstains and corpses, though she felt a little uncomfortable, she had seen far more terrifying scenes in her dreams.\n\nSo, she didn't think much of it.\n\nOn the sofa, after Ji Feiyu and Ji Yanshuang, the sisters, had a good, solid cry together.\n\nThe younger sister, Ji Yanshuang, asked: \"Sister, where did you and Dad find that Investigator Lu?\"\n\n\"Find? Your family wouldn't be able to find people like them.\"\n\nThis was Bai Xiaoxiao, who hadn't left yet, speaking.\n\nJi Yanshuang cast a curious gaze at her. She had a cute appearance, innocent eyes, and, having just recovered from a serious illness, exuded a fragile quality.\n\nHer voice was soft and gentle: \"Sister, do you know Investigator Lu?\"\n\nThough Bai Xiaoxiao was also a woman, how could she resist such a soft address? She nearly melted from cuteness.\n\nHer eyes were practically sparkling.\n\nShe cleared her throat: \"Ahem, I'm telling you this, but you mustn't spread it around. I'm an insider; you're not, so just listen.\"\n\n\"This Investigator Lu, he belongs to the 749 National Security Investigation and Containment Bureau. It's different from the regular National Security. The 749 is mainly responsible for investigating and containing all supernatural incidents that occur in our Great Han, as well as matters concerning spirits, monsters, and demons committing evil deeds.\"\n\n\"Their duty is to capture, imprison, and contain those malevolent spirits, monsters, and demons. But, well, this Investigator Lu, I think he has a bit of a murderous streak. While it's not against the rules, it's just too brutal. It's scary to watch; who tears people apart alive?\"\n\nThe sisters listened intently. Ji Yanshuang looked at the pool of blood on the floor.\n\n\"So, the one who died was a demon?\"\n\n\"No, this one, like me, should be a Chuma disciple.³ It's just that my lineage is an orthodox immortal lineage, backed by powerful entities. This one here is from an unorthodox path, and it probably committed some crimes. Then, somehow, your sister invited it over to treat your illness, and that's why the 749 people came.\"\n\nJi Feiyu quickly explained: \"He and I just met by chance at the mountain produce market. He said I had something unclean clinging to me. Later, he called me and asked me to bail him out, and he also said he could save your life, saying you... so I invited him here.\"\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: This idiom, \"One can be a thief for a thousand days, but one cannot guard against a thief for a thousand days,\" implies that it is impossible to be on guard against an adversary indefinitely; the proactive party always has an advantage.\n² Translator's Note: In Chinese web novels, a \"Golden Finger\" refers to a cheat-like ability or supernatural power that gives the protagonist an unfair advantage or an easy path to success.\n³ Translator's Note: \"Chuma disciple\" (出馬弟子) refers to a practitioner of \"Chuma Xian,\" a type of shamanism or spirit mediumship popular in Northeast China, where practitioners act as conduits for animal spirits to help people, often through divination or healing.",

    "content": "Ji Yanshuang listened carefully, nodding somewhat bewilderedly.\n\n\"Sis, thank you.\"\n\nShe reached out to hug her sister, then added: \"But next time, you can't be so desperate as to try anything.\"\n\nShe looked over again: \"This elder sister, what did you mean just now by 'insiders'? What does that mean?\"\n\n***\n\nThe story here was still continuing.\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nInside an ancient-style inn in Baiyao Ancient Town.\n\nThe black-veiled woman, sitting cross-legged on the bed, spurted a mouthful of inverse blood.\n\nA two-meter-tall burly man pushed the door open and entered.\n\n\"Ling Gu, what's wrong with you!\"\n\nThe woman shook her head: \"It's nothing serious, just that my technique was broken, and I lost a medicinal primer.\"\n\nThe burly man sat on the bed, his face full of heartache: \"There are so many medicinal primers, just let it go if it's lost. Tell me, who hurt you? I'll go kill him.\"\n\n\"I don't know his name, only that he's a 749 intern investigator with a star on his shoulder. Don't act rashly and ruin our plans. The Flying Centipede's completion is in these few days, and we need stability. We'll talk about this later.\"\n\nThe burly man's eyes were full of tenderness, and he gently put his arm around the woman's shoulder: \"Don't worry, Ling Gu, I'll listen to you. I definitely won't cause trouble.\"\n\n***\n\n749 Bureau Base.\n\nLu Ding and Yan Feifan returned to hand in their mission.\n\nIt was already night; ordinary people's lives had settled into tranquility, but the stage for 749 was just being set.\n\nDemons and monsters were more active at night, and nighttime had no effect whatsoever on Qi Refiners. After all, if you refine Qi, who wouldn't have night vision?\n\nTherefore, nighttime was when 749 investigators were most active.\n\nThe two walked over, stopping at the steps of the Mission Hall just about to go up.\n\nYan Feifan's steps gradually slowed as he fell behind.\n\nHis gaze swept forward, and his head slowly lowered.\n\nLu Ding turned to look: \"What are you doing? Let's go.\"\n\n\"Lu... Brother Lu, I need to use the restroom. Could you hand in the mission first, or wait for me?\"\n\nThough Lu Ding was a little puzzled, he still nodded: \"No one hands in a mission alone. I'll wait for you then; hurry up.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay, thank you, Brother Lu, thank you, Brother Lu, I'll be right back.\"\n\nJust as Yan Feifan turned to run quickly, an arm coming from the front hooked onto him: \"Where are you rushing off to, Brother Feifan?\"\n\n\"I... I'm going to the restroom, Brother Sun.\"\n\nSun Changming twisted his body to face the Mission Hall: \"You're already at the Mission Hall and you still need to use the restroom? Is that even proper? You have to hold it in!\"\n\n\"Hey, Old Du, weren't you looking for Brother Feifan? Look who it is!?\"\n\nIn the Mission Hall ahead, a young man scrolling on his phone turned to look.\n\n\"Isn't this Brother Feifan? Where did you run off to today?\"\n\nThe young man, known as Old Du, pocketed his phone and slowly walked down the steps with a fake smile on his face.\n\n\"What were you making a racket about this morning? Don't you know I was on a mission last night and didn't get any sleep? And you didn't even wash the clothes, who are you saving them for? Me?\"\n\nLu Ding listened from the side, speechless.\n\nDamn, he could still see bullying even in 749.\n\nBut then again, wherever there were people, there would be conflicts and contradictions.\n\nMoreover, people were all different. Unlocking their potential wasn't limited to model students; everyone had a chance to awaken.\n\nSo, it was normal for some bullies to infiltrate.\n\nBut for someone who was still useful to him to be bullied in front of him, that was not normal.\n\nYan Feifan glanced at Lu Ding, who was still by his side.\n\nYan Feifan looked at Du Guang, his eyes full of pleading: \"Brother Du, I was on a mission today. Can I wash the clothes when I get back tonight?\"\n\nAt that moment, he wished so much that Du Guang would save him some face in front of Lu Ding.\n\nJust as Yan Feifan had told Lu Ding, he wasn't good at fighting. His ability to be assigned to a four-person dorm with decent grades and even receive rewards was entirely due to his cleverness and exploiting loopholes.\n\nSo, over time, his shortcomings would become obvious.\n\nIn the same dorm, his status was naturally at the very bottom.\n\nSo, cleaning, washing clothes, and other chores were all his responsibility.\n\nWho told him to be the weakest?\n\nYan Feifan had gotten used to it. Ever since he was a child, his parents had told him that \"it's a blessing to suffer losses\"¹, that his family was poor, not to get into fights or conflicts with others, and such words had continued to influence Yan Feifan's growth until today.\n\nTherefore, relatively speaking, his character was somewhat cowardly.\n\nBut today, for the first time, a rebellious spirit rose within him.\n\nCompared to himself, Lu Ding was an unreachable existence, with absolute combat prowess and absolute talent; it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say he was high and mighty.\n\nYet, such a person would joke around with him and even praise him.\n\nAlthough he didn't know what Lu Ding was thinking, Yan Feifan had sincerely regarded this person, whom he had known for less than a day, as his first friend in 749.\n\nHe didn't want his friend to see his pathetic side.\n\nBut his pleading would ultimately come to naught.\n\nDu Guang raised his hand, and Yan Feifan already knew that the slap, not heavy but extremely insulting, would land on his neck as usual.\n\nAt this moment, Yan Feifan was ready to resist. As long as Du Guang dared to hit him in front of Lu Ding, he would fight him with all his might!!!\n\nThe next second.\n\nDu Guang, who had raised his hand, was sent flying sideways.\n\nLu Ding stood to the side, slowly retracting his foot.\n\nLooking at Du Guang, who was crumpled in the corner, almost kicked into a foldable screen.\n\nLu Ding's voice rang out: \"What the hell are you acting like?\"\n\nHe turned his head, pointing at the young man who was still gripping Yan Feifan's shoulder, and said: \"Let go of him.\"\n\nThe young man released his hands and took a step back: \"Lu Ding, this has nothing to do with me.\"\n\n\"You know me?\"\n\n\"If you know me, that makes things easy.\"\n\nLu Ding took a step forward, incredibly fast, and with a raised hand, slapped him across the face.\n\nThe young man spun three times in the air before landing.\n\n\"You know me, and you still dare to bully my auxiliary? From now on, you two will wash his clothes. Understand?\"\n\nThe young man covered his face and nodded: \"Okay... I'll wash, I'll wash.\"\n\n\"And you, do you understand?\"\n\nDu Guang, in the corner, suddenly felt humiliated, his eyes filled with resentment. Though unwilling in his heart, the power dynamic was clearly against him now, and he nodded with difficulty.\n\nA faint breeze blew.\n\nDu Guang looked up. His vision seemed enveloped in darkness, as a large, furry hand with long claws tore through the darkness before him like a ripped curtain, and from within it, a gaping, blood-red maw emerged.\n\n\"Come on, show me that look again.\"\n\nDu Guang curled up in the corner, kicking his legs backward non-stop, but the wall behind him left him nowhere to escape.\n\nHe could only raise his hands to block his face: \"I submit, I submit, I didn't mean anything else, really, I truly didn't mean anything else. From now on, I'll clean the dorm, I'll wash the clothes...\"\n\nLu Ding truly couldn't understand why someone, knowing they couldn't beat another, would still show such a venomous gaze.\n\nWas it to show how unyielding they were?\n\nWasn't that just seeking death?!\n\nAnd most importantly, knowing this person was unconvinced, some people actually wouldn't deliver the finishing blow?\n\nWhat kind of brain-dead idiots were these?\n\nLu Ding turned and walked up the steps: \"Still need to pee?\"\n\nYan Feifan quickly hurried to follow: \"No need to pee anymore, Brother Lu. Let's go hand in the mission.\"\n\n\"A lazy donkey always has to pee when it's time to grind². Next time, pee thoroughly beforehand.\"\n\n\"Alright, got it, Brother Lu.\"\n\n---\n¹ *It's a blessing to suffer losses (吃虧是福)*: A Chinese idiom suggesting that experiencing disadvantages or setbacks can ultimately lead to good fortune or character development.\n² *A lazy donkey always has to pee when it's time to grind (懶驢上磨屎尿多)*: A Chinese idiom describing someone who makes excuses or procrastinates when it's time to do work.",

    "content": "Mission Hand-in Point.\n\nThe staff member in charge of mission hand-ins extended a hand.\n\n\"Give me the Black Old Lady, and I'll add the contribution points for you.\"\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\n\"What!!? D-dead???\"\n\n\"Yup, beat her to death.\"\n\nLu Ding said in a flat tone.\n\nThe staff member looked him up and down. \"Didn't expect that. You're pretty impressive, taking down the Black Old Lady as just an intern investigator. Never heard of anyone like you before. What's your name, little bro?\"\n\n\"Lu Ding.\"\n\n\"Lu Ding!?\"\n\nThe staff member hurriedly checked the ID he hadn't examined closely just now.\n\nSure enough, the two big characters for \"Lu Ding\" were written plainly on it. In recent days, Lu Ding's name had been the talk of the town; everyone at the base knew who he was.\n\nHe did this hand-in work every day. As long as swiping the ID brought up the right pop-up and the mission hand-in went through without a problem, who would pay attention to what someone's name was?\n\n\"Ah, that explains it. Little Bro Lu, just nine more missions until you become a full-fledged investigator. Keep it up.\"\n\nAt this point, the staff member added in a heartfelt, earnest tone: \"Actually, Little Bro Lu, you could've gone a bit easier. If you'd brought her in alive, it would've counted as one completed mission plus one captured monster. Your remaining count would have dropped from nine to eight.\"\n\n\"So much more efficient.\"\n\nLu Ding played along, \"Right, right, right. I'll definitely go easier next time.\"\n\n\"Hey, that's the spirit.\"\n\nWith a flurry of clicks and taps, the staff member processed the hand-in.\n\n\"The contribution points and money have been sent to your account. Please check to confirm. Welcome back anytime, Little Bro Lu.\"\n\nLu Ding put away his ID, muttering to himself.\n\n*The service is pretty enthusiastic.*\n\nYan Feifan sidled up to him. \"Brother Lu, the young lady at the counter just now smiled at me. She's never smiled at me before. She's so pretty. It's all thanks to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, give me a break,\" Lu Ding retorted with a laugh. \"Didn't the girl selling bubble tea smile at you today, too? Why weren't you this happy then?\"\n\n\"That's different, Brother Lu.\"\n\n\"Hey, Brother Lu, are you going to White Kiln Ancient Town?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm planning to head over and check it out in a bit. I'm already on someone's hit list. If I don't solve this problem, I won't be able to sleep at night. I'll just have this feeling that someone's going to sneak up on me while I'm asleep.\"\n\nIt's actually not a bad feeling to be on someone's mind, but being on an enemy's mind is just the worst.\n\nIt's fine inside the base, but he's not going to be in the base forever. He has to go out on missions, right? What if someone suddenly gets him from behind one of these times? What then?\n\nLu Ding had no desire to ever be the one getting sneak-attacked.\n\n\"Brother Lu, let me go with you. It's good to have a helper, right? Besides, I've already looked up the data on White Kiln Ancient Town, checked the satellite maps, and memorized it all.\"\n\nIt sounded good, but Lu Ding was worried he'd get into trouble.\n\nBesides, this was his own business; it had nothing to do with the other guy.\n\nYan Feifan continued, \"Don't worry about me, Brother Lu. I'm a damn good runner. I might not be much help in a fight, but when it comes to running away, I'm absolutely first-class.\"\n\nLu Ding thought for a moment and agreed. \"Alright then, let's go together.\"\n\nThe main reason was that he didn't have a car. White Kiln Ancient Town was a bit far, and it would be inconvenient for him to go alone.\n\nJust as Yan Feifan had said, even though he couldn't help in a fight, he could run.\n\nSomeone who can pass through walls and travel underground—wouldn't running away be a piece of cake for him?\n\nThe two of them got in the car and set off again, heading straight for White Kiln Ancient Town.\n\nIn the car, Yan Feifan read the intel on White Kiln Ancient Town aloud to Lu Ding, which helped pass the time during the night drive.\n\n\"This White Kiln Ancient Town is famous for its white kilns. If you go back several hundred, even a thousand years, back in the feudal dynasties, these white kilns produced tribute wares. Unauthorized firing was forbidden.\"\n\n\"I've seen photos of the white pottery¹ online before, and it's just incredible. The porcelain can be fired to look as delicate as paper. And there was this white kiln Guanyin statue where you could clearly see every single strand of hair.\"\n\n\"With modern development, besides firing its white pottery, White Kiln Ancient Town also developed a tourism industry. Its rich cultural heritage and the well-preserved ancient town have indeed attracted a lot of tourists from out of town.\"\n\n\"I'd been thinking about visiting White Kiln Ancient Town before but never had the time. I never expected to go under such coincidental circumstances.\"\n\nThe whole way, Yan Feifan talked while Lu Ding listened. He didn't find it annoying.\n\nHe just wasn't as talkative himself. Listening was like getting an educational rundown, enriching his cultural knowledge.\n\nAs fate would have it, just as the moon was rising, a group of 749 full-fledged investigators, identifiable by the two stars on their shoulders, slipped into White Kiln Ancient Town under the cover of night.\n\nInside the inn.\n\nA muscular man, bare from the waist up, suddenly snapped his eyes open and rolled out of bed.\n\n\"Since you're here, you might as well show yourselves.\"\n\nThe woman on the bed, Ling Gu, pulled a garment over her shoulders.\n\nThe inn room door exploded inwards.\n\nTwo people stood there, one in front of the other. The one in front held a long and a short blade, long blade forward, short blade back. The one behind wielded a meteor hammer, which concealed sparks of fire that gave off faint points of light.\n\n\"Ma Qi, Shan Lingying, you're coming with us.\"\n\nLing Gu got out of bed, moving lightly to stand behind Ma Qi. \"Life-Reaping Blade Wen Yuquan, Wind-Fire Hammer Yin Feng. You two 749 mutts, where'd you pick up the scent? Your noses are really sharp to have found us here.\"\n\n\"Your stench? We didn't need to sniff for it. It's stinking up the whole street. It'd be hard *not* to find you.\"\n\nYin Feng retorted casually. Ling Gu's expression turned ugly. Wen Yuquan followed up, \"Alright, stop wasting time. Our colleagues are taking care of the others from your Heaven's Law Sect. Tonight, it's the two of us against the two of you. Two on two, no one else will interfere.\"\n\n\"Suits me just fine. Our last fight was too rushed. Today, I'll see just how much of that rumored power your Life-Reaping Blades actually have.\"\n\nHe raised his hands and channeled his qi. His muscles took on a faint golden glow as he thrust out a palm, which whistled through the air, aimed straight for Wen Yuquan's chest.\n\nThe long blade twirled like a flower, its sharp energy slicing through the air. The sheer curtains of the antique bed in the room fluttered wildly.\n\nA blade and a palm, flesh and steel, collided. The two each retreated half a step, seemingly evenly matched, but the sound of dripping and the smell of blood filled the room. It turned out that Ma Qi's palm had been cut and was now dripping blood.\n\n\"Some Iron Body Technique, some Pagoda-Bearing Arhat. Not so impressive after all, I see!\"\n\nYin Feng swung his meteor hammer, stirring up a gale inside the enclosed room. He struck out with a move called \"Spirit Snake Darts Its Tongue,\" attacking from a tricky angle.\n\nAt the same time, a black mist billowed up. Ling Gu formed a hand seal and channeled her qi. A round, black sphere with a trailing tail shot out from the mist and collided solidly with Yin Feng's incoming meteor hammer.\n\nAll four of them now fought without restraint, no longer trading blows tentatively. They immediately began unleashing their killing moves.\n\n\"Sweep Away a Thousand Troops!!!\"\n\n\"You, with the surname Wen! You disgrace the name of your Life-Reaping Blade! That was clearly 'Splitting Mount Hua,' but you shouted 'Sweep Away a Thousand Troops'!!\"\n\nThe window shattered as two figures burst out, fleeing.\n\nWen Yuquan gave chase, blades in hand, his expression unchanged. \"I shout it, you hear it, but you see my attack with your own eyes. You're the one who believed my words and got hurt, and now you're blaming me for shouting the wrong thing?\"\n\n\"You talk about me disgracing my title? You, the Pagoda-Bearing Arhat, and Ling Gu harm innocent people, raise flying centipedes, and maliciously murder local law enforcement officers. Do *you* deserve to use the name of an Arhat!!?\"\n\n\"Eat my blade and then we'll talk!\"\n\nA wave of blade energy shot out. Ma Qi dodged to the side and returned a palm strike.\n\nAt the end of the street ahead, a Jeep appeared.\n\nLu Ding, sitting in the passenger seat, caught a familiar scent that had clung to the fierce ghost at the Ji residence. He looked closely and saw that the scent was coming from the fleeing woman.\n\nA ruthless look appeared in his eyes, and killing intent solidified in his chest.\n\nLu Ding's voice was low and laced with excitement: \"Ram them!!\"\n\nYan Feifan didn't hesitate, only asking, \"Brother Lu, which one do I hit?!\"\n\n\"Hit the woman! Floor it!!!\"\n\n\"You got it, Brother Lu! Just watch! This is why I bought this thing—it's sturdy, durable, and has a great engine!!!\"\n\nYan Feifan roared his reply, blood rushing to his head. He slammed the accelerator to the floor, aiming straight for Ling Gu as she fled toward them.\n\n***\n\n¹`白窯` (bái yáo) translates literally to \"white kiln,\" referring to a type of Chinese porcelain known for its pure white glaze, famously Dehua porcelain.

    "content": "The headlights shone directly, making Ling Gu instinctively raise a hand to shield her eyes.\n\nShe never would have imagined that someone would come all this way over a casual threat, just to run her down.\n\nIt was Ma Qi who reacted.\n\n\"Ling Gu!!\"\n\nWith a loud shout, he slammed into her side. Ling Gu was sent flying by his skillful push, and the front of the car that should have hit her instead slammed into Ma Qi's stomach.\n\nDue to his tall stature, he instinctively tried to redirect the force upward upon impact.\n\nThe moment the jeep hit him, Ma Qi plunged headfirst through the jeep's windshield.\n\nLifting his eyes, he saw a strikingly handsome youth whose eyes blazed with unbridled fury.\n\n\"So you like taking the fall for others, huh!!\"\n\nLu Ding was furious. That collision should have left the woman dead or severely injured, but this bald giant had to interfere and ruin it.\n\nThis immediately pissed Lu Ding off.\n\nHe reached out, seized Ma Qi by his large, bald head, and dragged him through the shattered windshield into the car.\n\nHis fists rained down, each blow carrying the force of ten thousand catties, beating the Pagoda-Bearing Arhat¹ until he was completely powerless to fight back.\n\nHis Hard Qigong, normally invincible, was like paper-mâché at this moment.\n\nIt simply couldn't block Lu Ding's fists, which carried tens of thousands of catties of force.\n\nEven blocking Wen Yuquan's blade hadn't hurt this much.\n\nWith every punch, Ma Qi could feel his internal organs and bones shattering and shifting.\n\nBlood mixed with fragments of his organs spewed continuously from his mouth.\n\nHe struggled relentlessly, but it was useless, as if a great mountain was crushing him.\n\nFrom the driver's seat, Yan Feifan, not giving a damn about who was who, joined in as soon as Lu Ding made his move.\n\nHe pulled a short knife from who-knows-where and began hacking, chopping, and stabbing at Ma Qi's lower body, which was facing him.\n\nBlood sprayed everywhere.\n\nLing Gu, who had been pushed away, still hadn't grasped the situation and was about to come back to rescue Ma Qi in the car.\n\nThen she heard Ma Qi's agonized cry from within: \"Go!! Ling Gu, run!! It's an ambush!!! Ahhh!!!!\"\n\nAdding to that, Wen Yuquan and Yin Feng were already in pursuit from behind.\n\nLing Gu's eyes turned red. Filled with hatred, she had no choice but to retreat.\n\nBy the time Wen Yuquan and Yin Feng arrived, the jeep had stopped shaking.\n\nLooking at the scattered glass on the ground and the blood that had sprayed from inside the jeep to the outside, the two men exchanged a look.\n\nBoth saw the confusion in the other's eyes.\n\nNo colleagues should be here to support them, right? It's impossible they could have finished apprehending the other Tianli Cult members so quickly.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nYin Feng tilted his head, about to look inside.\n\nBut just as he took a step forward, both side doors of the jeep opened simultaneously.\n\nLu Ding and Yan Feifan, covered in blood, got out from both sides.\n\n\"Pah! Tough skin, hard to kill, a real son of a bitch to take down. I even got his blood in my mouth.\"\n\nYan Feifan said, flicking the now-nicked short knife in his hand.\n\nOn the other side, Lu Ding casually tossed away Ma Qi's arm, which he had torn off during the fight in the car, sniffing the air for the woman's scent to determine her escape route.\n\n\"Lu...\"\n\nYan Feifan was just about to call him \"Brother Lu.\"\n\nThen he saw two men standing in front of the car, their faces a mask of shock.\n\nHis eyes scanned the weapons in their hands before finally landing on the stars on their shoulders.\n\nYan Feifan instantly stood at attention. \"Greetings, Senior Investigators!\"\n\nLu Ding had noticed the two of them long ago; he just couldn't be bothered with them. They were on the same side, and by the looks of it, they were also after that woman.\n\nAs for greetings?\n\nThat was something only Yan Feifan would do.\n\nAlthough he was an intern investigator, he enjoyed the same priority as a full-fledged one.\n\nTechnically, they were of the same rank.\n\n\"Alright, Yan Feifan, check if your car can still run. I'm going after that woman. Be careful, I'll call you later.\"\n\nHaving identified the direction, Lu Ding leaped onto a rooftop and chased after Ling Gu in the direction she had fled.\n\n\"Brother Lu, Brother Lu, wait for me.\"\n\n\"Don't you go anywhere. Wait a minute.\"\n\nYin Feng, having snapped out of his daze, called out to Yan Feifan, who was about to run off.\n\nThis was too insane!\n\nNot only did two intern investigators run down the Pagoda-Bearing Arhat Ma Qi, but they also held him down in the car and killed him.\n\nThey even tore his arm off.\n\nWhy was Ma Qi called the Pagoda-Bearing Arhat? It was because he was tall and powerfully built, cultivated Hard Qigong, and had a background as a lay disciple of a Buddhist monastery.\n\nThat's why he was called the Pagoda-Bearing Arhat.\n\nHis body was tempered to the point where bullets couldn't penetrate it, and someone just tore his arm off?\n\nAbsurd. This was utterly absurd.\n\nJust a moment ago, Wen Yuquan's slash had only managed to break his skin.\n\nThese are intern investigators?!!!\n\nYou've got to be kidding me.\n\nWhat the hell happened back at the base? It's only been half a month since we left. How could you guys secretly evolve without including us agents who are out on missions!?\n\nYan Feifan put on a smile. \"What is it, Senior?\"\n\nYin Feng paused for a moment. \"Hmm... what's your cultivation level?\"\n\n\"Kaiqiao!\"\n\n\"What's his cultivation level?\" Yin Feng asked, pointing in the direction Lu Ding had gone.\n\nYan Feifan, being a bit cunning, replied, \"Brother Lu has taken a Kaiqiao Pill. He's at least at the Zhaoxuan stage.\"\n\n\"A Perfect Qualifier!!?\"\n\nYin Feng exclaimed in shock. But that didn't add up either. Even for a Perfect Qualifier, he'd never heard of anyone like that before. The only possibility was this month's qualification exam; he hadn't been back yet, so he didn't know the situation. But if it was this month's, to have this kind of combat power right after qualifying...\n\nIt was just too ridiculous.\n\nWhat did that make people like them?\n\nAfter all their years of training, had it all gone to the dogs?²\n\n\"Then he...\"\n\nSeeing that Yin Feng was about to ask endless questions, Yan Feifan grew anxious.\n\n\"Please, don't ask any more questions. Aren't you here to catch that woman who ran off?\"\n\nYin Feng grunted in acknowledgment.\n\n\"That's right. Brother Lu is here to settle a score with her, too. If we don't hurry up and follow, you'll be bringing back pieces of her corpse to complete your mission.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Wen Yuquan asked.\n\nYan Feifan's next words were shocking: \"She threatened Brother Lu. He'll probably tear her to pieces.\"\n\nHearing this, the two men leaped onto the rooftops, with Yan Feifan following close behind.\n\nAhead, in the woods outside Baiyao Ancient Town.\n\nLing Gu fled, her face a mask of terror as the presence behind her drew closer and closer.\n\nShe truly couldn't figure it out. Where on earth had this person come from? He looked a little familiar, but as she ran through the list of famous investigators from 749 in her mind, she couldn't place him at all.\n\nCould he not be from 749? Did she have a grudge against him?\n\nAt this thought, Ling Gu turned her head and shouted, \"Young man, might there be some misunderstanding between us?\"\n\nBut she found that Lu Ding, who had been in hot pursuit just moments before, was no longer behind her.\n\nSuddenly, the sound of wind whispered past her ear. Ling Gu threw up an arm to block, but the moment the force connected, she felt as if she'd been hit by a truck.\n\nThe terrifying power sent Ling Gu flying, and she crashed heavily into a large tree, blood gushing from her mouth.\n\nHer arm was instantly beaten into a twisted braid.\n\nA dull pain throbbed from her five viscera and six bowels.\n\nLu Ding landed before her, half-crouching, a smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"A misunderstanding? There's no misunderstanding between us. You're quite the forgetful one,³ aren't you? You just threatened me today, have you forgotten so soon? Didn't you say you'd memorized my aura? How is it that I'm right in front of you and you can't even sense it?\"\n\nAt that moment, Ling Gu's eyes widened.\n\n\"You're the one who broke my technique!\"\n\nAs she spoke, Ling Gu jabbed two fingers straight toward Lu Ding's eyes, but before they could connect, she felt a slight breeze, and her arm instantly disintegrated into tiny chunks of flesh that scattered across the ground.\n\nA woman's bloodcurdling scream echoed through the woods.\n\n\"You made me come all this way. I thought I was dealing with some powerful spirit or demon, but it turns out you're just human. You got my hopes up for nothing. So tell me, should I tear you to pieces, or should I slice you up?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ **Pagoda-Bearing Arhat (托塔羅漢):** A title referencing one of the Eighteen Arhats in Chinese Buddhism, known for his immense strength.\n² **Gone to the dogs (修到狗身上去了):** A literal translation of a Chinese idiom meaning that one's hard work and effort have been completely wasted.\n³ **You're quite the forgetful one (貴人多忘事):** A sarcastic use of an idiom that literally means \"important people have poor memories.\"",

    "content": "......\n\nLu Ding had originally thought he'd have another harvest today, just like the day he contained the Stubborn Rock of South Mountain—hitting a double yolk and getting two rewards.\n\nBut now, looking at her, she was just a person, not a demon or a monster.\n\nHis hopes of receiving a reward were dashed.\n\nThis left Lu Ding, who had run all this way, feeling a bit pissed off.\n\nIf you're a person, why the hell did you have to provoke me!!!\n\nWhy did it have to be a person?\n\nA ghost would've been fine, a demon would've been fine, but it just had to be a person.\n\nHearing his words, Ling Gu, amidst her pain, could only feel that this guy was a lunatic!!\n\nDamn it, 749 has a psycho!!!\n\nHe wasn't satisfied that she was a person. If that wasn't a psycho, what was?\n\nWas she really going to die at the hands of a psycho today?\n\nSuddenly, from all directions within the dense forest, came an old man's voice.\n\n\"Little one, one so young shouldn't have such heavy killing intent. Give me, Elder Qianjin, some face. Let Ling Gu go. It's best to leave a way out for others, so you can meet again on good terms.\"\n\nLu Ding didn't move. He propped up his head and quietly watched the Ling Gu before him. \"Hurry up, be happy. Someone's here to save you.\"\n\nA glimmer of hope for survival appeared in Ling Gu's eyes.\n\nThen, the woman's body and the large tree she was leaning against crashed to the ground in unison.\n\nA round head rolled across the ground.\n\nOnly then did Lu Ding slowly rise to his feet.\n\nSpreading his arms to the empty woods, he said, \"Oh, my apologies, Senior. I've never heard of any Elder Qianjin, so I accidentally stomped on your face. I am deeply sorry. As an apology, I am willing to accept any punishment you see fit. Please, come out and punish me. I'm terrified right now.\"\n\n\"Little one, you're courting death!!!!\"\n\nThe old man's furious voice rang out.\n\nLu Ding played along. \"Yes, yes, I'm courting death, I'm courting death. Hurry up and come out to kill me.\"\n\nBut after waiting a while, no person or attack appeared.\n\nLu Ding clicked his tongue.\n\nHow come this was different from how it's written in novels? In this kind of situation, isn't someone supposed to jump out and attack me?\n\nHe'd waited all this time. The big talk was impressive, but there was no sign of a person, not even a single hair.\n\n\"Hehehe, couldn't fool you. Truly, the new generation surpasses the old.¹ This old man can't get the better of you. Never mind, never mind, I'll be leaving now. The mountains are high and the road is long, perhaps we'll meet again if fate allows.\"\n\n\"Trying to leave? Too late.\"\n\nThe time he had just spent stalling was precisely to use the Flying Bear Pounce Kill Method to find the man's hiding spot.\n\nIf he had left earlier, Lu Ding really wouldn't have been able to find him. But now, it was too late for him to leave.\n\nLu Ding's open hands suddenly clapped forward, stirring up fierce gusts of wind. Wrapped within were a hundred slashes, encompassing the entire fan-shaped area in front of him.\n\nBushes, trees, grass, the topsoil, rocks—everything in sight was instantly turned into fragments as the slashes erupted.\n\nA muffled grunt sounded, the smell of blood filled the air, and a black shadow shot up into the sky from within the chaos.\n\n\"Found you, Senior.\"\n\nLu Ding swung, and a single, immensely powerful slash chopped out.\n\nLu Ding's Way of the Axle-Chariot was divided between quality and quantity. The lower the quantity, the greater the power, but the smaller the attack range.\n\nThe higher the quantity, the relatively lower the power, but the attack range would indeed become much larger.\n\nThe previous attack was just to find the man.\n\nThis slash, now, was the killing blow.\n\nElder Qianjin, in mid-air, had no time to change his position. He could only throw out a magical artifact shaped like a gold ingot, which grew in the wind and blocked the blow for him.\n\nA massive gash appeared on the gold ingot.\n\nLu Ding said unhurriedly, \"Magical artifacts do have their merits. But once an artifact suffers heavy damage, as its master, you probably aren't feeling too well either, are you?\"\n\nElder Qianjin, who had fallen to the ground, was panting slightly.\n\nIn the past, this formal \"you\" would have been a term of respect, but right now, it was pure sarcasm.\n\nElder Qianjin spoke with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. \"Young man, let's not be so quick to fight. Look, I didn't provoke you. We just had a little spat, a tiny bit of unpleasantness. This old man will apologize to you right here. I shouldn't have pulled rank or tried to be mysterious. If you think that's not enough, I can even kowtow to you.\"\n\n\"Also, I'll trade a treasure for my life. What do you think?\"\n\nWhether it was Chu Hao's vine armor from before or Elder Qianjin's gold ingot now, they were all good things that could save their lives in times of danger.\n\nIf not for these items, picking either one of these two—or even both of them together—they probably couldn't have withstood a single move from Lu Ding.\n\nThis also illustrated the importance of magical artifacts from another angle.\n\nSo when Elder Qianjin mentioned a treasure, Lu Ding became interested.\n\n\"Take it out so I can inspect it first.\"\n\nElder Qianjin gave an awkward laugh, revealing large, gold-cast buck teeth. \"Hehe, it's not on me.\"\n\nSeeing Lu Ding take a step forward with a dark expression, the old man grew terrified. \"Don't be hasty, don't be hasty! Although it's not on me, it's not far from here. The Wind-Settling Pearl! The Wind-Settling Pearl! The treasure is a Wind-Settling Pearl. It can calm the winds for steady travel and also let you ride the wind to fly. It's a truly rare treasure.\"\n\n\"Wind-Settling Pearl?\"\n\nLu Ding's eyes grew thoughtful.\n\nWhen talking about the Wind-Settling Pearl, one couldn't avoid the Flying Centipede, one of the Anomalous Beasts. The *Chronicles of Folk Anomalies* records that it has the ability to fly in the sky and burrow through the earth.\n\nIt delights in eating snake brains and is one of the natural enemies of serpents. Its absolute favorite is the brain of a Beautiful Woman Snake.\n\nIts appearance is similar to a giant dobsonfly, but in size and ferocity, it is a thousand times larger and more than a hundred times taller.\n\nThe Wind-Settling Pearl is the inner core of this Flying Centipede, but it's only a half-finished product.\n\nTo transform from an inner core into a Wind-Settling Pearl, it still requires artificial refinement.\n\nSuddenly, Lu Ding thought of the Ji family's second miss. Now he understood why the Ji family's second miss had been targeted by that woman from earlier.\n\nSo it was all for this Wind-Settling Pearl.\n\nAs mentioned, the Flying Centipede likes to eat the brains of Beautiful Woman Snakes, and these Beautiful Woman Snakes aren't just found anywhere. They have to be the female descendants of a human and a snake demon.\n\nNatural ones are very rare and almost nonexistent in modern times.\n\nUnless one uses wicked arts similar to Animal Creation Sorcery, then force-ripens them in the later stages, and when the time is right, extracts the living brain to feed the Flying Centipede, thereby increasing its magical power and speeding up the condensation of its inner core.\n\nOne link connected to the next.\n\nThe moment Lu Ding heard about the Wind-Settling Pearl, he instantly understood these people's objective.\n\nThe Wind-Settling Pearl interested him. The Flying Centipede, he wanted it just as much.\n\nThis was a notoriously ferocious demon-beast. If he could kill it, his golden finger should give him a pretty good reward.\n\nAs Lu Ding thought this, even the stern expression on his face softened.\n\nSeeing that he was moved, Elder Qianjin let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nThank goodness this little demon star knew his stuff. No idea which family raised him. Looking at his vibrant and youthful appearance, he was definitely no older than twenty.\n\nTo have such combat power at such a young age, what was he doing running off to 749 to be an intern investigator?\n\nIt was a complete waste of God-given talent.\n\n\"Where is the Flying Centipede?\"\n\nHey! This one knew his stuff and the tricks of the trade!\n\nHearing that there was a chance, Elder Qianjin scrambled up from the ground.\n\n\"Those people from the Tianli Cult are raising it in that mountain ravine over there.\" As he said this, he even jutted his chin towards the gully.\n\n\"Oh, right, the woman you just killed is a member of the Tianli Cult. Her name is Ling Gu. She's the one who did all the evil deeds.\"\n\n\"And you?\" Lu Ding asked, striking at the heart of the matter.\n\n\"What were you responsible for?\"\n\nAt that moment, Elder Qianjin started to panic. He stammered and stuttered, \"I... I... I just run errands.\"\n\nLu Ding raised his hand. His palm passed like a blade, and half a skullcap went flying.\n\n\"If you don't want to talk, then don't. All crows under the sky are black. Birds of a feather flock together. You're definitely no good either.\"\n\nWas Lu Ding a good person? He himself didn't know. His moral baseline was too flexible to qualify him as a good person, but it seemed he hadn't done anything truly terrible either.\n\nHe just liked to internally criticize things he couldn't stand to see.\n\n---\n¹ An idiom meaning \"the new generation surpasses the old,\" like waves on a river pushing the ones ahead.",

    "content": "...\n\nBesides, he was now a probationary investigator for Bureau 749. As the saying goes: as long as you're a monk, you ring the bell. He was simply following one of Bureau 749's guiding principles: to eradicate evil completely.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with that, right?\n\nLu Ding couldn't be bothered to interrogate the Thousand Jin Elder about why he was here.\n\nIn any case, he *was* here, mixed up with those people from the Heavenly Principle Cult.\n\nSo he might as well take them all out in one go. Better to kill the wrong person than to let one slip by. It was no trouble at all; he was already being generous by not making the Thousand Jin Elder thank him for it.\n\nGazing at the mountain hollow in the distance, Lu Ding leaped up and weaved nimbly through the trees.\n\nHe had just left.\n\nWhen Wen Yuquan and the others arrived right after.\n\nIt wasn't that Lu Ding's movements were so fast, but that he had finished the fight too quickly.\n\nThe three of them hurried as fast as they could but were still a step too late.\n\n\"Oh-ho, isn't this just over and done with? They're all dead, and it was a buy-one-get-one-free deal with an old man included.\"\n\nYin Feng clapped his hands. Just one word for it: \"Whoops.\"\n\nWen Yuquan's face darkened with exasperation.\n\nYin Feng went forward to examine the two horrifically mangled corpses. \"It's Ling Gu, no doubt about it. And the Thousand Jin Elder as a bonus. The two targets we were supposed to be hunting down are both dead at his hands. How are we going to report this when we get back?\"\n\n\"Tell them we went on an excursion to the countryside?\"\n\n\"That we did nothing, just wandered around all night? Damn it, I wouldn't even feel right taking the Contribution Points for this. What the hell is this supposed to be?\"\n\n\"Hey, Yan Feifan, has Lu Ding always been this homicidal? Ling Gu just spouted a few threats, and he traveled all through the night just to come here and kill her?\"\n\nOn the way over, Yan Feifan had briefly explained the cause and effect of their trip to Wen Yuquan and Yin Feng.\n\nTo them, it sounded truly absurd.\n\nThey were all Qi Refiners; who didn't have a bit of a temper?\n\nTo suffer a small loss and listen to some empty threats, only to take it so seriously that you track the person down and kill them on the spot.\n\nYou...\n\n\"That's probably how it is. Brother Lu's personality is just cautious. He didn't know Ling Gu was just talking tough. He was just worried she'd make trouble for him later, so he came over to check things out. He wasn't even sure she'd actually be here. Who knew that when he arrived, she really was.\"\n\n\"And on top of that, she couldn't beat Brother Lu. You can only say it was her bad luck.\"\n\nWen Yuquan, standing to the side, let out a laugh.\n\nIt was the first time he'd realized that a person could laugh when they were at a complete loss for words.\n\n\"Alright, what's done is done. White Kiln Ancient Town has some nice scenery, so let's just treat this as a field trip.\"\n\nHearing Wen Yuquan's words, Yin Feng didn't have any objections.\n\n\"I don't have a problem with a field trip, but I wanted to have a drink with Lu Ding and get to know him. The guy's my kind of people. Since our paths have crossed, I have to make friends with him, right?\"\n\nHe looked around. \"Where did he run off to?\"\n\nYan Feifan pulled out his phone. \"I'll send Brother Lu a message.\"\n\nNot long after Yan Feifan sent the message, Wen Yuquan's phone rang.\n\nHe picked it up and looked.\n\nA colleague, who should have still been in the middle of a battle, had actually sent him a voice message.\n\nWen Yuquan tapped the voice message.\n\nA woman's voice came through.\n\n\"Weren't there only six of us on this mission? Where did this extra probationary investigator come from? He's ridiculously strong. Who called for backup?\"\n\n\"Holy crap, Lu Ding went into the mountain hollow!?\" Yin Feng exclaimed, turning and running toward the hollow.\n\nIt turned out that just moments before, as Lu Ding was heading towards the hollow in search of the Flying Centipede, he had run into Shi Yinghe right at the entrance, who was engaged in combat with a fiend from the Heavenly Principle Cult.\n\nAt that point, the two had exchanged over a hundred blows without a clear winner. They were evenly matched, and both were injured.\n\nOverall, however, Shi Yinghe's injuries were more severe.\n\n\"Shi Yinghe, the official investigator from Bureau 749, known by the moniker 'Laughing Over-the-Shoulder.' Legend says your killing move is hidden in the hair on the back of your head, and no one who has seen it has lived to tell the tale. But what if you never get the chance to use that killing move on me?\"\n\nIn the darkness, black shadows flickered and darted about at extreme speeds.\n\nAn attack suddenly flew toward her.\n\nShi Yinghe slashed out with her sword, producing the sound of clashing metal.\n\nThe black shadow was sent flying backward. It was a wooden puppet the size of a water kettle, holding a blood-stained steel fork, hanging upside down from a tree in an offensive stance.\n\nShi Yinghe's eyes quickly scanned her surroundings.\n\nShe cursed inwardly.\n\nHer luck was just terrible. Her opponent had to be a Puppet Master. Just as he'd said, she did have a killing move, and a powerful one at that, but she couldn't even see her opponent right now. What good was a killing move without a target?\n\nFrom the start of the battle until now, she had already smashed several of the Puppet Master's puppets, but a new one would always appear.\n\nIt was as if he had an endless supply.\n\nAs soon as an old one was broken, a new one would take its place, on and on.\n\nEvery time she managed to find the Puppet Master's hiding spot, he would use a puppet to escape again after just a few exchanges.\n\nIf this continued, there was only one outcome for Shi Yinghe tonight: death in the line of duty.\n\n\"Shi Yinghe, oh Shi Yinghe, how about this? If you beg me, perhaps I'll be merciful and spare your life. After all, I don't want to be charged with the crime of killing a 749 investigator, you know?\"\n\n\"Oh, okay, okay! I'm begging you, please let me go! Don't kill me! It hasn't been easy for me, I'm still a pure young maiden¹, you know. So beautiful, but I've never had a man, nor have I made any money. It's too early for me to die. How about you show some mercy and spare me?\"\n\nShi Yinghe said this as she tossed her longsword aside.\n\nThe Puppet Master, hidden in the shadows, had his expression instantly turn bizarre.\n\nHe was the one who had made the demand, but now that she had actually done it, he was in an awkward position.\n\nMainly, he had never expected Shi Yinghe to have so little backbone. She said she'd surrender, and she surrendered, even throwing away her sword.\n\nAlthough this surrender was mostly for show.\n\nWhat the hell...\n\nFor a moment, the Puppet Master was caught in a dilemma.\n\nIt was at that exact moment that a voice came from behind him.\n\n\"See? You told her to do it, and now that she has, you're not happy.\"\n\n\"Who's there!?!?\"\n\nThe Puppet Master's heart leaped in shock. He raised his hand, thrusting a short-handled fork behind him.\n\nAn impassioned scream rang out as the arm holding the fork flew high into the air.\n\nThe bushes rustled, and the Puppet Master scrambled out, a look of terror in his eyes.\n\nHe couldn't muster any will to resist. Based on that one move alone, he knew this was an existence he could not afford to provoke.\n\nLu Ding followed at a slow pace, then brought his foot down on the Puppet Master's heel. With a *crack*...\n\n\"Aah!!!! You... Who are you!\"\n\nShi Yinghe was also sizing up the newcomer. When she saw the single star on Lu Ding's shoulder, her expression was identical to that of Wen Yuquan and Yin Feng earlier.\n\nAstonishment, and confusion.\n\nWhere did this probationary investigator come from?\n\n\"That question again. Is that the only thing you people know how to ask?\"\n\nGrabbing the Puppet Master off the ground, Lu Ding spoke in a calm tone, \"Let me ask you something different. Where is the Flying Centipede?\"\n\nAt that moment, the expression on Lu Ding's face magnified endlessly in the Puppet Master's eyes.\n\nOrdinarily, it was unremarkable, but the longer he looked, the more it revealed a strange and terrifying quality.\n\nHis body trembling, he pointed with his remaining arm toward the hollow. \"It's... over there.\"\n\n\"Then I'll trouble you to take me to it.\"\n\nThe moment Lu Ding said this, the Puppet Master screamed tragically. He knew that if he went, he probably wouldn't come back alive.\n\n\"I DON'T WANT TO!!! I'M NOT GOING!!! SHI YINGHE!!! SHI YINGHE!!! Aren't you a 749 investigator?! I'll confess!!! I'll confess everything!!! Don't make me go with him!!!!! I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING!!!!!\"\n\n\"We came here to raise the Flying Centipede to cooperate with the Treasure Hoarders!² We provide the Wind-Calming Pearls, they provide the manpower, and together we're going to Headwind Mountain to capture the Ginseng People and Ginseng Horses!

    "content": "...\n\nShi Yinghe looked at the sky, planted her feet on the ground, and scanned her surroundings.\n\nDidn't know. She didn't know a thing.\n\nWas someone calling her name? Didn't seem like it.\n\nSeeing her act this way, the Puppeteer's composure shattered.\n\n\"Shi Yinghe, you fraud who deceives the world for fame! And you call yourself an official investigator of 749! You have no backbone, leaving me to die! I'll fucking ********...\"\n\nAs Lu Ding dragged the Puppeteer's leg farther and farther away, Shi Yinghe bent down, picked up the longsword on the ground, and gave it a swing to shake off the clinging mud.\n\n\"Tch. Backbone? What's backbone worth? Talk to me about backbone when you actually manage to stay alive. And you call me out for leaving someone to die? You, a depraved fiend from the Heavenly Principle Cult, calling me a fraud? Pah.\"\n\nThe Puppeteer's brain must have short-circuited. The woman was willing to toss aside her sword and beg for mercy, to feign surrender, and he was still talking about backbone. Did he have a hole in his head or something?\n\nWatching the two figures disappear into the dense forest, Shi Yinghe pulled out her phone and sent a message to the operation's group chat.\n\n\"Wasn't this mission supposed to be just the six of us? How did an intern investigator get added? This guy is unbelievably tough. Who called for reinforcements?\"\n\nThis was what had prompted Wen Yuquan's reaction after receiving the message just moments before.\n\nIn the mountain ravine.\n\nA chill arose on its own as yin energy raged and swarms of venomous insects swept past.\n\nLu Ding, holding the figure upside down, landed on the tip of a tree, his gaze sweeping across the valley floor. The place wasn't huge, but it wasn't small either. He had already scanned almost all of it.\n\nAside from the Flying Centipede, he had seen all sorts of bizarrely shaped venomous insects.\n\n\"Hey, wake up. Where's the Flying Centipede?\"\n\nLu Ding shook the Puppeteer, who was drowsy from excessive blood loss.\n\nHe slowly opened his eyes, his pale lips quivering as he formed words: \"In... in the cave.\"\n\nLu Ding looked forward.\n\nAt the base of the mountain wall at the very front of the valley, hidden behind some trees, there seemed to be a cave wide enough for one person to pass through.\n\nA putrid, acrid stench wafted from within.\n\nMoreover, the cave's entrance was smooth, as if something frequently passed through it.\n\nBut Lu Ding was no fool. Could a place like this be entered casually?\n\nThe environment was so narrow; if he encountered something troublesome, it would probably be difficult to even escape.\n\n\"You're not trying to pull a fast one on me, are you?\" he asked, holding the Puppeteer up to his face.\n\nHe shook his head slightly. \"No, it's really in there. I've told you what you wanted to know. Please let me go... let me face judgment from Bureau 749. I really... I really can't take it anymore. If I don't get medical attention, I'm going to bleed to death.\"\n\nEven though he was a Qi Refiner, he wasn't invincible. Missing an arm and being held upside down all this time—not even Superman could endure this.\n\nThis Puppeteer was no idiot either.\n\nGiven the things he had done, if he fell into the hands of Bureau 749, he might still live, though he would suffer for it later. But there was also the possibility of atoning for his crimes through meritorious service.\n\nBut if he remained in this man's hands...\n\nHe was afraid he wouldn't even live to see tomorrow's sun.\n\nAs the saying goes, a miserable life is better than a good death.\n\nHe hadn't lived long enough yet; he didn't want to die.\n\nLu Ding didn't answer him. He just looked at the cave entrance, then at the Puppeteer in his hand.\n\nThen, he was seen lifting the Puppeteer, swinging him in several large circles, and flinging him toward the cave entrance.\n\n\"You survive first, then we'll talk about handing you over to the Bureau for judgment.\"\n\n\"F*ck you*! Not a single one of you from 749 is a good person!!!!\"\n\nThe Puppeteer's body slammed straight into the cavern.\n\nA rustling sound arose, and the Puppeteer's miserable screams echoed continuously from within the cave.\n\nThe next moment, the rustling sounds vanished.\n\nA buzzing, like that of a helicopter, filled the air.\n\nA man-sized black shadow shot out from the cave.\n\nLu Ding couldn't see it clearly, nor did he care what it was. He raised his hand and sent out a slash.\n\nBut the thing was simply too fast.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, it dodged Lu Ding's attack.\n\nClinging to a tree branch, a crisp *crack* echoed in the darkness.\n\nThe man-sized giant dobsonfly was chewing on the Puppeteer's head.\n\nIts body was covered in armor bristling with spikes, and combined with its enormous mouthparts, it could easily crush an ordinary person's body in a single bite.\n\nThis was the Flying Centipede.\n\nIts thick armor and high attack power were not its most commendable features. Its speed was what made it truly terrifying.\n\nLu Ding looked at the Flying Centipede clinging to the branch.\n\nIf one were to disregard this creature's cruel and terrifying habits, as well as its status as a monster, it was actually quite cool!\n\nEspecially the pair of large pincers on its head, which gleamed with a faint luster even in the darkness of the night.\n\nIf one could enter this thing into a bug-fighting competition...\n\nWho could possibly beat it?\n\nThere wouldn't even be a contest. All the other contestants combined probably wouldn't be enough to fill its stomach.\n\nA pity it was a monster.\n\nAnd since it had appeared before Lu Ding, its fate was sealed—it had to die!\n\nThe man and the monster faced off.\n\nLu Ding struck first. A burst of slashes erupted, blanketing the entire ten-meter area around the Flying Centipede.\n\nIf it's fast, then just use carpet-bombing style annihilation!!!\n\nRock and trees were pulverized.\n\nThe Flying Centipede beat its wings amidst the slashes, its extreme speed and sharp angles allowing it to continuously evade Lu Ding's attacks.\n\nThis move played right into Lu Ding's hands.\n\nHe pressed down, stomping on a tree branch.\n\nAs he applied force, the branch gradually bent into an arc like a bow.\n\nWhen Lu Ding released the pressure, the straightening branch instantly flung him forward.\n\nHe shot out like an arrow from a bowstring.\n\nHe raised a hand, a palm strike carrying a colossal force, and struck the Flying Centipede.\n\n\"Got you.\"\n\nSlashes erupted from his palm—one, ten, a hundred...\n\nThe clang of blades striking metal rang out incessantly.\n\nThe Flying Centipede's hard armor shattered in an instant. A series of slashes landed on the tender flesh beneath, and a shrill, piercing insectoid cry screeched.\n\nThe man-sized Flying Centipede was dismembered in mid-air.\n\nBy the time Lu Ding landed, standing firm, his hand was not only stained with the sticky fluids from the Flying Centipede's flesh but also held a walnut-sized, light green pearl.\n\nThis was the Flying Centipede's inner core.\n\nIt was also the main ingredient for refining the Wind-Fixing Pearl.\n\nThe mechanical voice sounded in his ear.\n\n[Monster Contained: Flying Centipede]\n[Reward Gained: Wind-Fixing Technique]\n[Wind-Fixing Technique: Can still howling gales and roiling seas of clouds. Can also ride the wind to fly, soaring over the five great mountains and rivers.]\n\nThe Wind-Fixing Technique?\n\nLu Ding looked at the Flying Centipede's inner core in his hand.\n\nDid this mean the Wind-Fixing Pearl he had gone through so much trouble to find was useless?\n\nHow could a magical artifact be better than a magical technique? Not to mention, the techniques he obtained from his Golden Finger were instantly max level.\n\nHigh power, low consumption, no special conditions.\n\nFurthermore, there was no risk of it being damaged; it was exceptionally stable.\n\nHis feet slowly lifted off the ground.\n\nJoy surged in Lu Ding's heart.\n\nSeriously, who could resist the temptation of flight?\n\nTo fly through the heavens and burrow through the earth—this was a pursuit etched into his very bones.\n\nLu Ding had been somewhat dissatisfied with his own speed, but with the acquisition of the Wind-Fixing Technique, his only shortcoming was now covered.\n\nRanged attacks, close combat, strength, speed—a comprehensively developed, hexagon warrior!\n\nRight now, Lu Ding himself didn't know just how strong he truly was.",

    "content": "After stowing the Flying Centipede's inner core, he took out his phone. On the notification screen, there were several messages from Yan Feifan.\n\n【Brother Lu, we've stumbled into the mission of official investigators.】\n\n【Brother Lu, where are you? Stop killing, stop killing! These are their mission targets.】\n\nThe most recent one had just been sent.\n\n【Brother Lu, we're outside the valley now. Are you inside? The three 749 investigators you ran into on your way here said they want to come in and find you.】\n\nLu Ding replied.\n\n【Don't come in. I'm coming out now.】\n\n【Brother Lu, did you find the Flying Centipede? I heard from Sister Shi that you went in to find it?】\n\n【Already killed it. By the way, who is Sister Shi?】\n\n【The female investigator you just saved.】\n\nOutside, Yan Feifan was showing the chat history on his phone to Wen Yuquan and the other two.\n\n\"The inner core is probably in Brother Lu's hands. We don't need to go in anymore. He's coming right out, so we can just wait.\"\n\nThe three of them looked at each other, each lost in thought.\n\nShi Yinghe was the first to speak. \"I heard that puppet master say they were raising the Flying Centipede specifically to use its inner core to refine a Wind-fixing Pearl. Once it was made, they planned to cooperate with Treasure Seekers¹ to go to Mount Dingfeng and capture the Ginseng People and Ginseng Horses.\"\n\n\"Our mission is now complete, and the matter of White Kiln Ancient Town has been investigated. Just now, Xue Ning, Meng Huaizhou, and You Yuan said in the group chat that they're done on their end too. They even rescued a heavily injured law enforcement officer who's now being rushed to a major city hospital. They won't be meeting up with us and will see us back at the Bureau. They were just asking about the Flying Centipede and the external help.\"\n\n\"Now that the Flying Centipede has been killed by Lu Ding, the inner core is probably in his hands. This... how are we supposed to write the report?\"\n\nThe three were a bit helpless; this report would be genuinely difficult to write.\n\nYin Feng, casually swinging his meteor hammer, suddenly said, \"How about we just don't mention the Wind-fixing Pearl? Lu Ding took it down anyway. Our mission was only to investigate and capture the Heavenly Principles Cult demons in White Kiln Ancient Town. Although all our targets are dead, their side still has survivors.\"\n\n\"Not writing about it saves trouble. The inner core wasn't part of the mission anyway, so we don't need to turn it in. Whoever gets it, keeps it. Haven't the Bureau's rules always been like this?\"\n\n\"I have no problem with that, but Xue Ning and the others also contributed to this mission. According to the rules, they should get a share of this inner core. Now that it's in Lu Ding's hands and he's the one who killed the Flying Centipede, what do we say when Xue Ning's group asks?\"\n\nShi Yinghe raised a new problem.\n\nHaving witnessed Lu Ding's methods, they had no designs on the Flying Centipede's inner core.\n\nWhoever killed it, owned it.\n\nAlthough it was a treasure, there was no need to get into a dispute with Lu Ding over it.\n\nWouldn't that be asking for trouble?\n\nBut the other three, Xue Ning's group, didn't know that.\n\nFor this mission, the original six had agreed that contribution points would be split evenly, and any spoils of war would also be shared equally.\n\nAfter all, no single one of them had the ability to deal with all the Heavenly Principles Cult demons.\n\nWho could have predicted that a Lu Ding would pop up midway?\n\nNow that everyone knew about the Flying Centipede, the existence of the inner core couldn't be hidden. When asked about the spoils, could you really say you didn't know?\n\n\"Let's just tell Lu Ding the problem directly. I don't really care. I wasn't the one who killed the Flying Centipede, so I can do without it. We'll just see what he thinks about Xue Ning and the others,\" Wen Yuquan said, offering a solution.\n\n\"That doesn't seem very decent, does it?\"\n\nYin Feng's words made Wen Yuquan see red, and he just threw his hands up.\n\n\"This won't work, that won't work... I'm done. I don't know, I don't want it, and it's not something I'm entitled to anyway. As far as I'm concerned, the Flying Centipede's inner core belongs to Lu Ding. He killed it. You all can do whatever you want, and Xue Ning's group can do whatever they want. It has nothing to do with me.\"\n\n\"If you're not happy with it, go fight Lu Ding. That's also a rule, after all. If reason doesn't work, then might makes right.\"\n\n\"I agree. If anyone's not happy with it, they can come and fight me,\" Lu Ding said, leaping out from the woods.\n\nHe landed steadily in front of the four of them.\n\nOn his way back, he had already thought it through. For him, this thing was basically useless. He already had the Wind-fixing Technique, so why would he need a Wind-fixing Pearl?\n\nBut making him take something out of his pocket once it was in there was impossible.\n\nHe was short on cash right now, so he might as well sell the thing. Yan Feifan's car had been wrecked like that; Lu Ding felt that, by all rights, he should pay for the repairs.\n\nOtherwise, it just wouldn't be right. Wouldn't that be bullying an honest person?\n\nHe couldn't bring himself to do something like that.\n\n\"Brother Lu!!!\" Yan Feifan shouted.\n\nLu Ding nodded. Look at that attitude. How could he not fix the car?\n\nIf Lu Ding weren't broke, he would have bought him a new one as compensation.\n\nThat car was covered in blood, and there were still corpses of Heavenly Principles Cult demons lying inside. Simply wretched.\n\n\"Lu Ding, let me introduce myself. My name is Wen Yuquan, a formal 749 investigator.\"\n\n\"Hello, Lu Ding. I'm Yin Feng.\"\n\n\"My name is Shi Yinghe...\"\n\nThe three introduced themselves to Lu Ding one by one.\n\nHe didn't put on any airs and was soon chatting warmly with the three of them.\n\n\"Lu Ding, about the Flying Centipede's inner core, everyone else is easy to deal with, but there's one person you need to be careful of.\"\n\nLu Ding looked at Wen Yuquan and asked, \"Who?\"\n\n\"Xue Ning. He has the nickname 'Little Overlord,' and he's not quite like us. He comes from a family of Qi Cultivators and began his internal and external training at the age of eight. His mastery of the Xue Family's Overlord Spear is sublime. In terms of combat strength, you could say he's the strongest among us.\"\n\n\"He joined 749 in the second half of last year and has completed over twenty missions without a single failure.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, he has a defiant personality. He might not want the Wind-fixing Pearl, but this is a matter of face he'll definitely come to contest. Even if he wins, he'll still give the pearl to you.\"\n\nThis guy was certainly interesting. He didn't want the item, just cared about his pride.\n\nHowever, Lu Ding definitely couldn't give him that pride, nor the item.\n\nIn that case, it would have to be settled through skill.\n\nLu Ding had never met someone from a family of Qi Cultivators before, and he was curious to see what was different about them.\n\n...\n\nMeanwhile, in Jing City, one of Yunhai's prefecture-level cities.\n\nThe Dragonsoar Tower, the landmark building of the Dragonsoar Group. At the top of the tower, a dragon-shaped structure roared towards the sky.\n\nThis was a branch of the Heavenly Principles Cult.\n\nThe group of Heavenly Principles Cult demons from White Kiln Ancient Town had come from here.\n\nThe vast office was exquisitely decorated.\n\nA one-eyed man in a black suit stood before the window, swirling a glass of wine in his hand.\n\n\"Director Liu, the situation in White Kiln Ancient Town has been exposed. 749 got involved. Our people are either dead or injured, and even the Flying Centipede's inner core has fallen into the hands of those 749 investigators.\"\n\nThe man's hand slowed its swirling motion.\n\nA hoarse voice spoke up: \"Flying Centipedes are easy to raise, but one that can incubate an inner core capable of being refined into a Wind-fixing Pearl is one in a hundred. It requires the perfect alignment of time, place, and people, none of which can be missing. This year, not only has our Taisui ore production not increased, it has actually decreased.\"\n\n\"The Ginseng People and Ginseng Horses are the key to our apologetic gift. Without the Wind-fixing Pearl, we can't get up Mount Dingfeng, and we can't catch them. When that time comes, it won't just be me who suffers; everyone in our branch will be facing punishment.\"\n\n\"Send people to snatch it! Before they get back to 749, get me that Flying Centipede's inner core!!!\"\n\n***\n\n¹**Treasure Seekers (憋寶人):** A term from Chinese folklore for individuals with a supernatural ability to sense and locate hidden treasures.",

    "content": "On the highway back to Yunhai.\n\nSince Yan Feifan's car was full of bloodstains, Lu Ding and Yan Feifan took Wen Yuquan's car, while Yin Feng and Shi Yinghe were in another car.\n\nOn the way.\n\nYin Feng's car drove in front, with Wen Yuquan's car following behind.\n\nLeaning back against the leather seat, enjoying the comfort, Lu Ding asked, \"Wen Yuquan, your car has good space, and the interior looks nice, the exterior is handsome too. How much did it cost?\"\n\n\"Just over 300,000.\"\n\n\"Over 300,000!!? This is a G-Wagen, and all this is real leather, only over 300,000? My car cost over 600,000.\" Yan Feifan said, somewhat surprised, from the back seat.\n\n\"It's different when we buy compared to others. Besides, my car doesn't have regular paperwork. I bought a collateralized car. Our Yunhai is a capital of three dynasties, with many rich people. Collateralized cars, legally auctioned cars, black cars from abroad, they're countless. All sorts of good stuff, and cheap too. No need to buy through official channels.\"\n\n\"When the time comes, I'll get a license plate from the bureau, and all the paperwork will be there.\"\n\nThis perspective was certainly unique: spending the least money to get the most done.\n\nYan Feifan leaned forward and asked, \"Brother Quan, haven't you encountered the repossession team?\"\n\nCollateralized cars are good in every way, except for one thing: they're prone to being repossessed by collection teams. There are hundreds of GPS trackers, making it impossible to guard against.\n\nSpeaking of this, Wen Yuquan could barely contain the smile on his face.\n\nHe nodded, \"I did. I had parked the car on the side of the road, and when I came out, the car was gone.\"\n\n\"Turns out, in less than half a day, the owner of that collateralized car dealership returned the car to me, exactly as it was, and even added fuel and washed it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Yan Feifan was a bit confused.\n\n\"Just lift the back seat and you'll know.\"\n\nLu Ding also turned his head to look, and saw Yan Feifan shifting sideways. The back seat could indeed be lifted. When opened, a finely crafted sniper rifle and several handguns lay quietly inside.\n\nSeeing this, Lu Ding also smiled.\n\nPresumably, the owner of that collateralized car dealership must have been stunned when they repossessed the car and saw these items.\n\n749 investigators are permitted to carry firearms.\n\nHowever, guns aren't that useful for Qi Refiners.\n\nYan Feifan touched the sniper rifle.\n\n\"Brother Quan, what do you use this thing for?\"\n\nWen Yuquan casually replied, \"Sometimes when I go on missions that require entering the mountains, there's not much to do there, so I use it to shoot birds or something, just for fun, like a big toy. Do you like it? If you like it, I'll give it to you. I can just go back and get a slip to claim another one. Anyway, guns are plentiful in our bureau; they just sit around collecting dust.\"\n\nThis was one of the perks of being a formal investigator.\n\n\"No, no need.\" Although Yan Feifan refused verbally, the fondness in his eyes couldn't be hidden. What boy doesn't like guns? However, he didn't plan to accept one from Wen Yuquan; instead, he wanted to wait until he became a formal investigator himself, then get a slip and claim one to play with.\n\n\"Lu Ding, you want to buy a car? I can introduce you to the collateralized car dealership where I bought this one. They have many good cars, and they're cheap.\"\n\n\"Sure, but you'll have to wait until I've sold the Wind-Settling Pearl.\"\n\nLu Ding felt it was time he got a car; otherwise, it would be truly inconvenient. As for a driver's license, he knew how to drive anyway, so he'd just get one later.\n\n\"You're selling the Wind-Settling Pearl?\"\n\nWen Yuquan asked, somewhat surprised. After all, this item was a magical artifact. He truly hadn't expected Lu Ding to intend to sell it.\n\n\"It's not very useful in my hands; I might as well sell it for money. I just don't know how much it can sell for.\"\n\nAs for the price of the Wind-Settling Pearl, Lu Ding was truly unsure. It was his first time doing something like this; he had never sold one before.^(1)\n\n\"This item is priceless. Selling it for cash would be too cheap. You could trade it for some cultivation resources, and then some loose change too. It should probably be worth several million to tens of millions.\" Wen Yuquan was indeed a bit tempted, but he couldn't afford the price, nor did he have the mind to trick Lu Ding.\n\nThis price did excite Lu Ding a little.\n\nHe had never seen so much money in his life.\n\nThinking of this, Lu Ding turned around, \"Feifan, what do you think of this car?\"\n\n\"It's great. It looks handsome, and it's presentable when you drive it out. Plus, it's durable. When we go on missions, constantly on the go, we need this kind of car. Sports cars are all looks and no practicality.\"\n\n\"Alright then, once I sell the Wind-Settling Pearl, I'll arrange one for you. We won't keep your old one.\"\n\nHearing Lu Ding's words, Yan Feifan instantly sat upright, \"Really, Brother Lu!!?\"\n\nYan Feifan wasn't unable to afford hundreds of thousands or even millions, but if Lu Ding gave it to him, it would be different.\n\n\"Of course, once the money arrives, we'll swap them, we'll swap together!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Brother Lu!!\"\n\nYan Feifan said excitedly.\n\nWen Yuquan, who was driving, changed his expression, \"It seems someone doesn't want us to return so smoothly.\"\n\nLu Ding's smile faded. Looking in the side mirror at the cars behind them, a convoy of black cars had caught up, flanking their two cars from both sides, forming a pincer movement.\n\nHe turned his head to look at the black sedan driving alongside them.\n\nA man wearing a smiley pig-head mask turned his head, raised a hand, and made a gun gesture, placing it against his temple.\n\nLaughter emanated from beneath the mask, unrestrained and arrogant.\n\nLu Ding's lips curved upwards.\n\nThen he heard Wen Yuquan next to him saying, \"They dare to block a 749 car? They must be tired of living. There are too many cars on the highway. How about we take the next exit and play with them there?\"\n\nNo sooner had he finished speaking than Lu Ding raised his hand and unleashed a cleaving strike.\n\nThe black sedan next to them instantly split into two, erupting in a blaze of fire.\n\nLu Ding pulled open the car door, \"What are we waiting for to exit the highway? Let's get back quickly, I still need to sell the Wind-Settling Pearl.\"\n\nHe then leaped out, his figure swaying with the breeze in the air, landing steadily on top of a black sedan.\n\nThe people from the Tianli Sect were stunned!\n\n\"Damn it, is this still a 749 investigator? They actually dare to make a move in front of so many people.\"\n\nThe reason they dared to ambush Lu Ding's group on the highway was that they figured 749 agents definitely wouldn't dare to act on the highway, especially with so many people around. Once they exited the highway, their people would be waiting ahead.\n\nRelying on numerical superiority, even if the 749 investigators were ruthless, they would still have to obediently lie down!\n\nBut Lu Ding, without rhyme or reason, directly made his move, shattering their ambush plan.\n\nThis move was truly unexpected for these people.\n\nSeeing that Lu Ding had already gone out, Wen Yuquan shouted, \"Feifan, come and drive! I'm going out to help Lu Ding!\"\n\nEarlier, Wen Yuquan hadn't witnessed much of Lu Ding's methods, and he felt a pity in his heart. Now that he had a chance to fight alongside him, he naturally wouldn't let it slip.\n\n\"Brother Quan, you go ahead. The car's with me!\"\n\nYan Feifan crawled from the gap between the driver's seats to the front to take the steering wheel.\n\nWen Yuquan pulled open the car door, flipped himself onto the roof, and stood up.\n\nHe then saw Lu Ding, on top of the black sedan, raise his hand and make a slashing motion. The car roof instantly splintered into four pieces, losing control, with severed limbs and broken arms swaying and scattering within. He grabbed a live person, leaped back onto the G-Wagen's roof, and ripped off their mask.\n\nBeneath was an unfamiliar face with a panicked expression.\n\n\"Tell me, who sent you to intercept us?\"\n\n\"You... you took our things. I advise you to return them, otherwise...\"\n\nThe man hadn't even finished speaking when his head exploded directly, sending red and white matter splattering everywhere.\n\n\"If you don't want to talk, then don't.\"\n\nLu Ding couldn't be bothered to listen to his threats; they were meaningless and a complete waste of time.\n\nMoreover, as soon as that sentence was uttered, it was obvious even by thinking with one's toes^(2) that it was the Tianli Sect, given he had only taken the Tianli Sect's Wind-Settling Pearl.\n\nWen Yuquan finally truly witnessed Lu Ding's decisive and ruthless character.\n\nHe knew that this matter wouldn't end easily today, so he immediately pulled out his phone: \"I'll notify the cleanup crew to come. You be careful.\"\n---\n^(1) Chinese idiom: 大姑娘上轎頭一回 (dà gūniang shàng jiào tóu yī huí) - literally \"a big girl riding a sedan chair for the first time,\" meaning it's one's first experience doing something.\n^(2) Chinese idiom: 用腳指頭想都知道 (yòng jiǎozhǐtou xiǎng dōu zhīdào) - literally \"can even figure it out by thinking with one's toes,\" meaning something is extremely obvious or a no-brainer.",

    "content": "Lu Ding nodded, then looked at the black convoy ahead.\n\nSomeone among them, holding a communication device, shouted, \"Damn it, even 749 isn't afraid, what the hell are we afraid of? If the sky falls, the tall ones will hold it up! Go! Get that thing back for me!!\"\n\nWith a command, car doors swung open one after another, and dozens of masked cultists from the Tianli Sect flew out, landing on the car roofs.\n\nThe convoy spread out, gradually advancing to encircle Wen Yuquan and Yin Feng's vehicle.\n\nYin Feng, holding his meteor hammer, flipped onto the car.\n\n\"There's a second round, just hadn't had enough fun yet! Come on!!!\"\n\nWen Yuquan also drew his long and short dual blades.\n\nSeeing Lu Ding, who was empty-handed beside him, he asked, \"Do you have a weapon?\"\n\nLu Ding slowly floated up, hovering above the car roof, extended a hand, and spread his fingers. Countless slashes erupted and cut through, the sound of flesh being torn echoing incessantly.\n\nBlood sprayed out, splattering freely like a rain of blood.\n\n\"I don't need a weapon.\"\n\nLu Ding's voice was not loud, yet it was extraordinarily shocking.\n\nSo this was his true combat power.\n\nEver since acquiring the skill of Forget Form, which allowed him to manually activate the state of Unity of Heaven and Man, Lu Ding had never turned it off.\n\nAlthough movement and combat would affect the efficiency of Forget Form.\n\nBut it was still quite useful, faster than even a typically talented Qi Refiner cultivating diligently.\n\nThus, Lu Ding's combat power was rapidly increasing with every passing moment.\n\nWhether walking, fighting, or just living his daily life, for him, it was all cultivation.\n\nThis single attack shocked Wen Yuquan and Yin Feng, and likewise stunned the Tianli Sect group.\n\nWith one move, he instantly killed several people, leaving no complete corpses.\n\nHow were they supposed to fight this?\n\nTo be intimidated before battle was a major taboo.\n\nSeeing the low morale, the commander of the Tianli Sect's mission for this trip became restless.\n\n\"Chopping up my men like vegetables, isn't that a bit much?\"\n\nThe man, wearing a snake-head mask, looked on with a chilling aura.\n\nLu Ding looked at him: \"If you're not convinced, you can come yourself.\"\n\n\"What's with the act? Hiding your head and tail behind a mask, yet you still step out! Take this hammer!!!\"\n\nYin Feng, without any wind-up, instantly started spewing, the meteor hammer swinging in his hand stirring up a breeze. With a \"Sparrowhawk Flips Over the Mountain\" move, he directly swung the meteor hammer towards the man.\n\nThe man raised his hand; it was a pair of palms calloused and thicker than an ordinary person's.\n\nHe firmly caught Yin Feng's meteor hammer, instantly revealing the disparity in their strengths.\n\nHis tone was disdainful: \"Twenty-Four Road Meteor Hammer, nothing special. Foul-mouthed junior, come here!!!\"\n\nThe man yanked the hammerhead, and with terrifying force, directly pulled Yin Feng over. Raising his hand, he channeled his Qi and struck with a palm, heavy and powerful, tinged with a faint golden light.\n\nLu Ding's figure instantly shifted horizontally.\n\n\"Then you can take one of my 'nothing special' too!!\"\n\nHe pushed with both palms, tens of thousands of jin of force instantly erupting.\n\nThe man dared not be careless, changing from a single hand to both hands, and similarly pushed with his palms: \"Then you'll taste my Great Vajra Palm!\"\n\nBang!!!\n\nTheir palms clashing produced a sonic boom.\n\nThe sedan beneath the man's feet instantly caved in, momentarily losing control on the highway. Both Lu Ding and the man used the force to leap and land elsewhere.\n\n\"Great Vajra Palm! You're Yuan Baifeng of the Tianli Sect!\"\n\nWen Yuquan caught Yin Feng, who had been thrown back by Lu Ding, and identified the snake-masked man.\n\nYuan Baifeng's hands trembled, and a wave of shock rose in his heart. His physical strength was already terrifying enough, and what he cultivated was the Great Vajra Palm, one of the secret transmissions of Buddhism.\n\nThe power of his dual palms was nearly ten thousand jin.\n\nFurthermore, his realm was Spirit Ocean. Having just exchanged a palm strike with Lu Ding, he had a rough feeling that Lu Ding's realm should be at Illumination Vortex.\n\nBut for a Qi Refiner at Illumination Vortex, at such a young age, to have physical strength even more terrifying than his own, and to injure him with just one move.\n\nWas this even reasonable?\n\nHearing someone identify his true identity, Yuan Baifeng simply stopped pretending.\n\nHe ripped off the troublesome mask from his face, swept both palms in front of him, channeling his Qi to \"support the heavens.\"\n\n\"Kid, I acknowledge your strength. Physically, you're stronger than me. But in terms of realm, I'm higher than you. My last palm strike wasn't comfortable for you, was it?\"\n\nLu Ding shook his hand: \"It wasn't very comfortable, it made my hands red.\"\n\nHis terrifying strength of tens of thousands of jin was no joke. To think of injuring him solely with physical power, this man wasn't qualified.\n\nYuan Baifeng instantly felt humiliated. Made his hands red!?\n\nWhy didn't I smash your hand to pieces?\n\n\"Stubborn kid, hand over the item and we'll let this go today, otherwise...\"\n\n\"Alright, I'm too lazy to listen to your nonsense. I don't want to hear it.\"\n\nAlways spouting threats, Lu Ding got annoyed just listening. If you have the ability, come and get it; if not, don't babble. If problems could be solved just by talking, what would 749 be for? They might as well replace everyone with negotiation experts.\n\nThe Wind Stabilizing Art was unleashed to its extreme.\n\nLu Ding's figure was like a phantom, borrowing force from thin air.\n\nA terrifying slash cut through.\n\nYuan Baifeng, with imposing aura, his bare palm covered in golden light, neither dodged nor flinched, but slapped directly towards Lu Ding's slash.\n\nHe originally thought that with the suppression of his realm, coupled with the age gap, even if Lu Ding's physical body was terrifying.\n\nHe had, after all, immersed himself in cultivation for so many more years.\n\nAny casual strike, he should be able to take it, right?\n\nWho knew that the moment his bare palm connected.\n\nThe pain of flesh being sliced instantly came.\n\nHalf his palm was severed.\n\nYuan Baifeng's eyes showed a hint of panic. He looked up just in time to see Lu Ding closing in, a sarcastic smile appearing on his face.\n\nTalking about age and gaps with him, wasn't that a joke?\n\nExcept for the Flying Bear Pouncing and Killing Method, all of Lu Ding's arts were max-level skills directly granted by the system.\n\nTo cultivate an art to perfection, it wasn't something that could be achieved by merely relying on time and effort.\n\nOriginally, Yuan Baifeng still had some chances of winning.\n\nBut he, presuming on his age and higher realm, stubbornly took Lu Ding's slash and had half his palm crippled.\n\nFifty percent of his Great Vajra Palm techniques were instantly crippled.\n\n\"Great Vajra Palm, now try *my* palm!!!\"\n\nLu Ding, relying on the Wind Stabilizing Art, closed in on Yuan Baifeng with extreme speed.\n\nA tyrannical aura emerged from him, and the entire scene around him changed. Behind him, a giant bear with twin wings appeared faintly, making the same palm-pushing gesture as Lu Ding.\n\nThe surrounding light and breeze all receded.\n\nIt was an extreme visual impact, difficult to describe with words.\n\nAt this moment, Yuan Baifeng could no longer dodge. If he were to recklessly attempt to evade, he would only disregard his defenses and leave his most vulnerable spots open to the enemy.\n\nHelpless, he could only push out both palms through the pain to block.\n\nWho knew that the moment their two palms collided.\n\nYuan Baifeng's palm was like it was made of tofu; flesh disintegrated, and bones pierced backwards, impaling his shoulder blade.\n\nLu Ding's palm struck his chest, directly penetrating through, passing from front to back.\n\nThe palm went in through the front of the chest and came out the back, accompanied by flying blood mist.\n\nConcentrating force to pierce through.\n\nAll the force had penetrated inside.\n\nBlood gushed continuously from Yuan Baifeng's mouth and nose.\n\nHe stubbornly held onto his last breath, raised his hand, and struck Lu Ding's chest, only to find that the remaining force was like a mud ox entering the sea, leaving no trace. Lu Ding didn't even sway.\n\nSeeing that he still had one last breath he hadn't exhaled.\n\nLu Ding, killing him and striking at his heart, said: \"Strength isn't determined by age. Your Great Vajra Palm is... nothing... spe... cial.\"\n\n\"Pfft!!!\"\n\nYuan Baifeng's injuries could no longer be suppressed. He spat out a mouthful of blood that scattered like a mist of gore, his last shred of vitality faded, and his corpse just hung there on Lu Ding's hand.",

    "content": "...\n\nNearby, the battle between Wen Yuquan and Yin Feng was still ongoing.\n\nLu Ding shook the corpse from his arm and turned to charge into the crowd.\n\nLike a ferocious beast that had hibernated all winter, so hungry its chest was stuck to its back, he threw himself into a flock of sheep. Chunks of flesh and pieces of corpses flew everywhere; not a single one of the Heavenly Principle Cult heretics who died by his hand was left with a whole body.\n\nThe nearby cleanup crew entered the scene. When they saw the hellish battlefield on the highway, their faces couldn't help but turn pale.\n\nThey had seen their share of large-scale scenes, but those were always left behind by evil cultists or cruel monsters.\n\nNo one in Bureau 749 had a fighting style this savage.\n\nThey watched Lu Ding by the side of the highway.\n\nA black cigarette was brought to his lips, held by a hand stained red with blood.\n\nHe exhaled a puff of smoke.\n\nYin Feng cocked his head and glanced at him. \"I used to think you were just a guy with some skills and a bit of an arrogant streak. For a trainee investigator, your attitude was pretty brazen. But looking at you now... I'd say you were actually very polite when we first met.\"\n\nHis words made Lu Ding choke on his smoke and roll his eyes. \"If you don't know how to talk, then don't.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahaha! Isn't that a compliment? Seriously, I'll definitely call you for any good missions in the future. Your combat power is no joke—you even killed Yuan Baifeng. After today, your name will probably spread all over this turf of Yunhai. Who knows what kind of nickname they'll give you.\"\n\n\"I hope it's something cool. The kind that sounds more elegant.\"\n\nYin Feng looked him up and down.\n\nHis clothes were dyed crimson with blood.\n\n\"What part of this has anything to do with elegance? You're the pure embodiment of violence. It's only because of that face of yours that the word 'aesthetic' can even apply.\"\n\nWen Yuquan walked over at that moment. \"If Lu Ding hadn't joined 749, he'd definitely be our bureau's most wanted criminal.\"\n\nAs he said this, he and Yin Feng met each other's gaze, and the two of them laughed without restraint.\n\nLu Ding, standing to the side, was a little speechless.\n\n\"Hey, Lu Ding, you should take your shirt off. Isn't it uncomfortable, being covered in blood?\"\n\nShi Yinghe's eyes were shining as she said this.\n\nLu Ding thought that made sense, so he simply took off his shirt, revealing a well-defined, muscular torso.\n\nPaired with his neat, short hair and sharp, handsome features—sword-like brows and star-like eyes—he was a total killer with the opposite sex.\n\nShi Yinghe's eyes were glued to him.\n\n\"Shi Yinghe, you're drooling!!\"\n\nYin Feng's exaggeration made Shi Yinghe touch her chin. Finding nothing, her face instantly turned red, and she shouted in annoyance.\n\n\"Yin Feng, you son of a bitch, I'm going to kill you.\"\n\nThe events on the highway were witnessed by many people, and some videos even made their way onto the internet.\n\nBut they were fleeting, scrubbed before they could cause a major sensation.\n\nAlthough the incident didn't cause a stir among the general public, in the circle of Yunhai's Qi Refiners, Lu Ding became completely famous.\n\nHis cruel methods, the horrifyingly bloody battle sites he left behind—all these things combined successfully earned Lu Ding the nickname \"Dismemberer Tai Sui.\"¹\n\nBasically, none who died by his hand were left with an intact corpse.\n\nSo the nickname was quite fitting.\n\nLu Ding had made a name for himself by stepping on the corpse of Yuan Baifeng.\n\n...\n\nBack at Bureau 749.\n\nLu Ding and everyone else involved were called in for debriefing, mainly because the incident had caused too much of a disturbance.\n\nThere were too many ordinary people on the highway.\n\nInside the Debriefing Room.\n\nA man and a woman looked at Lu Ding.\n\n\"So you really went to kill Ling Gu just because of a single threat?\"\n\n\"Not entirely. It was mainly because she was using evil arts to harm people. As a 749 investigator, when faced with Qi Refiners like her who cause such harm and chaos, I have a duty to apprehend or stop them.\"\n\nLu Ding's answer was watertight.\n\nThe two didn't press for more details. Closing their notebooks, they said, \"Here's the situation, Lu Ding. This incident has had a significant impact, so for the time being, you should take a rest. Don't go on any missions for now to avoid being recognized by ordinary people.\"\n\n\"So what if I want to go on missions?\"\n\nWith his golden finger,² telling him not to kill monsters was more torturous than killing him.\n\nCouldn't be helped, he was just that hardworking.\n\nThe two interrogators exchanged a look, clearly not expecting Lu Ding to say such a thing.\n\nBut this mentality was indeed well-suited for an investigator at 749.\n\nIt wasn't that investigators who completed one mission a month were bad, but that an investigator who completed multiple missions a month and wanted to keep taking them was even better.\n\n\"Alright, how about this? You can take on a Patrol District. We'll assign you a district to patrol, and you can handle all matters within it as you see fit. Patrolling a district counts as one mission.\"\n\n\"If a special incident occurs during your patrol time and you handle it, each one you resolve will count as a completed mission. What do you think?\"\n\nA Patrol District... Zhou Jie and Long Shanshan seemed to be doing that kind of work before.\n\n\"Will there be monsters or supernatural incidents in the Patrol District?\"\n\nLu Ding had no objections to patrolling; his only concern was whether there would be monsters for him to kill.\n\nThe two interrogators' attitudes softened, and smiles appeared on their faces.\n\n\"There have been many sudden incidents in Yunhai recently. If you want, we can assign you a district with a higher probability of them.\"\n\n\"Yes, please assign me a place with a high frequency of special incident outbreaks.\"\n\n\"A Patrol District requires two people. Normally, we assign partners randomly, but given that your strength far exceeds that of a typical trainee investigator, you can designate an investigator to team up with you. Do you have a suitable candidate in mind, or should we make a random assignment?\"\n\n\"Let's go with Yan Feifan. I'm used to working with him.\"\n\nCompared to getting to know a stranger, Lu Ding felt Yan Feifan was a better choice.\n\nIt would also save them the break-in period. What if they assigned him someone whose brain wasn't wired right?\n\n\"Alright, we'll arrange it for you immediately. You should receive the district information by tomorrow. Be sure to go and handle the handover.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe debriefing ended. Lu Ding had been exhausted for two days without proper rest and was covered in blood and filth.\n\nHe returned to his dorm for a comfortable hot shower, then sent a message to Wen Yuquan, asking him to inquire about selling the Wind-Settling Pearl.\n\nAfter that, Lu Ding fell directly into a deep sleep, not waking until evening.\n\nHe returned to his daily routine: eating, sleeping, and finally, cultivating.\n\nAt this time, Lu Ding's realm was the first level of the Zhaoxuan Realm.\n\nHe had opened one-tenth of the qi vortexes in his body.\n\nSeated cross-legged on his bed, he circulated the Flying Bear Pouncing Kill Method, absorbing the ambient spiritual energy from the heavens and earth, converting it into his own stored spiritual qi. He then used his spiritual qi to fill the empty acupoints, creating self-sustaining vortexes.\n\nAs the vortexes were filled one after another, Lu Ding's realm advanced to the second level of the Zhaoxuan Realm as a matter of course.\n\nBut he didn't intend to stop there. Instead, he pressed on in one go, continuing to absorb and refine the ambient spiritual energy.\n\n9:31:58 PM, Zhaoxuan Realm, third level.\n\n11:46:21 PM, Zhaoxuan Realm, fourth level.\n\n3:01:13 AM, Zhaoxuan Realm, fifth level.\n\nAt 7:30 AM, right on the dot, Zhaoxuan Realm, sixth level.\n\nHe only stopped when he felt a faint, aching pain coming from the meridians in his body.\n\nThe Zhaoxuan Realm was mainly about absorbing worldly spiritual energy, converting it into one's own spiritual qi to nourish the body, and filling empty acupoints to create qi vortexes. Lu Ding's physical body couldn't be compared to those in the Zhaoxuan Realm; even few Qi Refiners in the Spirit Sea Realm could match him, unless they were a Spirit Sea Realm Qi Refiner with great talent who specialized in cultivating the physical body.\n\nTherefore, the \"nourishing the body\" step could be skipped.\n\nAs for absorbing worldly spiritual energy, he had the *Wang Xing Zhi Wei*³ ability, which allowed him to achieve Oneness of Heaven and Man. Where others could only sip ambient spiritual energy through a straw, Lu Ding could suck it in with a water pump.\n\n---\n¹ **Tai Sui (太歲):** A star deity in Chinese astrology.

    "content": "...\n\nNext was filling the qi vortex in his aperture. This step emphasized physical strength, innate talent, and patient, grinding effort.\n\nThe qi vortex was fragile, and a moment of carelessness could damage it, which was why nourishing the physical body was essential.\n\nBut Lu Ding's physique was already terrifyingly strong, so his qi vortex could withstand him aggressively packing Lingqi into it.\n\nMoreover, the State of Formlessness once again played a crucial role.\n\nOnce he entered the state of Heaven-Man Unity...\n\nLu Ding was like Zhang Fei threading a needle—crude strength with underlying finesse.[^1]\n\nHis actions seemed brutish, but every step of the filling process was perfect.\n\nThe combination of all these factors resulted in Lu Ding's terrifying cultivation speed, climbing from the first to the sixth level of the Zhaoxuan Realm in a single night.\n\nIt was only because his meridians wouldn't allow it—transporting any more celestial cycles might damage them, after breaking through so many levels tonight—otherwise, he absolutely would not have exited his cultivation state.\n\nHis personal strength had soared once again.\n\nLu Ding stretched, feeling the new power within his body.\n\n\"I should let them rest for now. I'll continue cultivating once my meridians have recovered.\"\n\nLu Ding spoke to himself.\n\nBare-chested, he opened his wardrobe to see that he hadn't brought many clothes to begin with—his previous circumstances hadn't allowed for it—and he had ruined one set yesterday.\n\nThe 749 uniform wasn't particularly good-looking.\n\nNow, besides the uniform, there was only one set of clothes left in the wardrobe.\n\nLu Ding took it out and put it on. \"I'll buy a few more outfits when my jurisdiction is assigned and I'm out on patrol by myself.\"\n\nAs soon as the words left his mouth, it was a case of speak of the devil, and he shall appear.\n\nHis phone buzzed with a message. It was about Lu Ding's jurisdiction assignment.\n\n[Respected Intern Investigator Lu Ding, your jurisdiction has been assigned. Please proceed to the Baofan District Public Security Bureau in Baofan District, Yunhai City, within twelve hours of receiving this notice to complete the handover.]\n\n\"So I'm supposed to cooperate with the local Public Security Bureau?\"\n\n\"That makes sense. If I had to rely on my own patrols, with such a large area, I'd never get comprehensive information. Only the local Public Security Bureau can gather a lot of information quickly and efficiently.\"\n\nAs a semi-local of Yunhai who only had residency but no house, Lu Ding knew the name Baofan District all too well.\n\nThe district lived up to its name—prosperous and flourishing, where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold.\n\nIt was just a notch below the few top-tier central districts.\n\nAnd that small difference was because the land prices in Baofan District were too high to demolish and redevelop much. Decades ago, this had been Yunhai's economic zone. Although it had lost its former glory, it was still crawling with rich people. You could throw a brick and be guaranteed to hit someone worth tens of millions.\n\nAnd the population was a chaotic mix.\n\nLu Ding hadn't expected to be assigned to a jurisdiction like this.\n\nOn his phone screen, a message from Yan Feifan followed.\n\n\"Brother Lu, are you awake? You looked so tired yesterday, I didn't dare disturb you. I got my jurisdiction assignment. I bought you some breakfast, I'll hang it on your door in a bit. Remember to eat it when you wake up. I have to go take up my post. I probably won't be able to take on missions with you for a while.\"\n\nLu Ding picked up his water glass and took a sip.\n\n\"I'm awake. Have you eaten breakfast?\"\n\n\"Brother Lu, you're up so early? I haven't eaten yet, I'm a bit short on time. I was thinking of going early, to avoid my new colleagues finding fault with me.\"\n\n\"Eat first, then go. The colleague who's starting with you is me. I won't give you a hard time.\"\n\nLu Ding sent the message with a smile. Yan Feifan was still as reliable as ever. This mindset of his was good in some ways and not so good in others, and it would probably be difficult to change it overnight.\n\nWhatever happens, happens.\n\n\"Brother Lu, really!?\"\n\n\"Would I lie to you?\"\n\n*Knock, knock, knock...*\n\nA knock came from the door.\n\nLu Ding went to open it. Yan Feifan stood outside, holding breakfast.\n\n\"Brother Lu, it's great that we're assigned to the same jurisdiction! I was afraid I wouldn't be able to handle such a big area on my own.\"\n\nUpon learning of his assigned jurisdiction, Yan Feifan had been terrified.\n\nMainly because he had heard of Baofan District's reputation. The place was both prosperous and chaotic, filled with all sorts of characters, not to mention a high rate of special incidents. With his meager abilities, being assigned to such a district was a joke.\n\nNow that he knew Lu Ding was with him, Yan Feifan instantly understood. It was fine, then. He was still just the gofer.\n\nThe main combat force was Brother Lu.\n\nHe absolutely loved being the gofer.\n\nSlipping on the shoe covers he had brought with him, he entered and set down the breakfast.\n\nLu Ding took a steamed bun and had a bite. \"What's there to be afraid of? It's not like Baofan District has a mouth that can bite you.\"\n\n\"Brother Lu, you may only know one side of the story. Baofan District is extremely chaotic, and its rate of special incidents is in the top three in Yunhai, and it's always been high. In the past, they always sent formal investigators to this place. You tell me, how could I not be scared when an intern investigator like me gets this kind of deployment?\"\n\n\"And the other patrol officer would most likely have been an unfamiliar formal investigator. I haven't really dealt with formal investigators much, and the few times I have, they got annoyed with me. I just... sigh.\"\n\n\"Oh? You know a lot about Baofan District?\" Lu Ding looked at him while sipping his congee.\n\n\"I know a little. The previous patrol officers for Baofan District were our bureau's formal investigators, Cross Sword Bei Heguang and Elixir Hand Ming Jun. I hear they're both tough characters, and they hadn't been in the post for long. But they made a major mistake during their patrol, causing severe casualties.\"\n\n\"That's probably why they were replaced.\"\n\n\"A major mistake? I want to hear about this in detail.\"\n\nSince he was about to take up the post, he needed to get his intelligence straight.\n\nLu Ding had no intention of going in blind. He was confident in his abilities, but he wasn't a brainless brute.\n\n\"This is just what I heard. At the end of last month, a sinkhole opened up somewhere in Baofan District. They say there was an ancient tomb underneath. Here in Yunhai, a three-dynasty ancient capital, ancient tombs are as common as cabbages, nothing strange about that. But this tomb was a little different.\"\n\n\"There was a White-Haired Roarer being raised inside, along with quite a few treasures. When the tomb collapsed, the White-Haired Roarer escaped and started hurting people. As formal investigators, Bei Heguang and Ming Jun went to deal with it.\"\n\n\"The two of them heavily wounded the White-Haired Roarer and forced it back into the tomb. But then, after tying it up, they turned around to look for treasure. This led to the Roarer escaping a second time and killing a lot of ordinary people. In the end, a local faction of Lingqi cultivators from Baofan District had to step in to subdue it.\"\n\n\"Afterward, a conflict broke out between them over the treasures in the tomb, and those two couldn't even win the fight.\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding could only think how stupid those two were.\n\nThey should have at least killed the White-Haired Roarer before looking for treasure.\n\nLetting someone else step in was one thing, but then to get into a conflict and lose the fight...\n\nA disgrace.\n\nA true disgrace.\n\nBut he also had a question. \"With the appearance of this ancient tomb, our bureau doesn't care if other Lingqi cultivators get involved?\"\n\n\"Brother Lu, although 749 manages Lingqi cultivators, their existence dates back to ancient times. How long has our 749 even been established? We can't just deprive the independent Lingqi cultivators of their space to survive just because 749 was founded, can we? Besides, if those treasures fell into the hands of ordinary people, they wouldn't be treasures, they'd be disasters.\"\n\n\"What's more, while they are indeed treasures, compared to what our bureau has, in both quantity and quality, they're like the very tip of a single hair on one of nine oxen. And those people helped out. This is how independent Lingqi cultivators survive. It's like in novels when a secret realm appears; even a monopolistic sect or dynasty won't take it all for themselves. That would be detrimental to management.\"\n\nThat was a novel perspective Lu Ding had never heard before.\n\nHe had come into this halfway. He hadn't been with 749 for long, so it was normal that he didn't understand these things.\n\n***\n\n[^1]: A Chinese idiom referring to someone who appears crude or brutish but is capable of delicate and precise work.

Someone like you isn't suited for front-line work; you're more fit for management.\" Lu Ding said casually.\n\n\"Oh no, Brother Lu, with my combat power, if I were in management, no one would listen to me.\"\n\nLu Ding glanced at him, jokingly, \"So you do have that ambition? Goodness, Yan Feifan, you're so audacious you even want to be an official!\"\n\nThis comment scared Yan Feifan badly, and he quickly denied, \"No, no, Brother Lu, I don't.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahaha, I'm just kidding with you, don't be so nervous. Relax a bit. Alright, we've eaten enough, it's time to go to Baofan District.\"\n\nYan Feifan was startled, \"Hey! Wait, Brother Lu, I haven't eaten yet.\"\n\n\"That's what you get for not eating earlier; it'll teach you a lesson.\"\n\n\"Brother Lu, that's not right, wasn't it you who told me to talk?\"\n\nLu Ding was only joking; he still had to let the other person eat.\n\nYan Feifan quickly gulped down his porridge and stuffed down the steamed buns, finishing in no time.\n\nNext up was assuming duty in Baofan District!\n\n...\n\nBaofan District Public Security Bureau.\n\nAs 749 Special District Management Personnel, Bei Heguang and Ming Jun's office was on the top floor, with ample space and an expansive view.\n\nBut such a prime location, due to one mistake, they could only relinquish.\n\nThey also had to return to receive punishment from the bureau.\n\nThe two were currently packing their things.\n\nMing Jun looked around, \"Ah Guang, are you really willing to just leave like this?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, of course I'm not willing. We haven't even looked behind that large door yet; there's definitely good stuff there. But there's nothing we can do now; who told us we made a work error? This is fate; we have to accept it.\"\n\nThe reason the two hadn't killed the White-furred Roar back then was because they saw many treasures while pursuing it.\n\nThey had originally planned to kill the White-furred Roar first and then collect the items.\n\nHowever, when they saw the stone door inscribed with mysterious runes, they decided to put the White-furred Roar incident aside for a moment.\n\nThey would open the door first. There must be good things behind it.\n\nLest things change and others arrive too late.\n\nIn the end, the door didn't open, and the White-furred Roar escaped.\n\nLater, the two went back to check, but the stone door remained tightly shut. During this time, they had tried every method they could think of, yet still couldn't open that stone door.\n\nThey had planned to use slow and steady effort, bit by bit, to grind the stone door open.\n\nEven if punishment came from the bureau, it wouldn't matter; they'd accept it.\n\nIt's not like they'd be transferred back before their term was up, right?\n\nBut then, hey, they really were transferred back.\n\nWhen the transfer order came down, both of them felt like their world had collapsed.\n\nNow Bei Heguang was saying it was fate and they had to accept it.\n\nMing Jun instantly became annoyed, \"Fate, my ass! I was able to become a Qi Refiner from an ordinary person; that's heaven's favor. From joining 749, working my way up from intern investigator to official investigator; that's heaven's fondness. Now encountering this stone door, it must be heaven's reward for me!\"\n\n\"I'm not reconciled to just leaving like this!\"\n\nBei Heguang put down his things and crossed his arms, \"Then present a plan so I can see your brilliant idea.\"\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\n\"What about that? Do you know who the investigator coming this time is?\"\n\n\"Are you crazy? The bureau's information control is so strict, who would know that? I'm not in management.\"\n\n\"Aren't you well-connected with a wide network? Why don't you try to find out?\"\n\nBei Heguang hesitated, \"Should I try to find out then?\"\n\n\"Just hurry up, don't ask questions!!!\"\n\nBei Heguang pulled out his phone and activated his network of contacts.\n\nAfter a while, his brows slowly furrowed, \"That's odd, this doesn't comply with regulations.\"\n\n\"How is it? How is it? Did you find out?\" Ming Jun asked anxiously from the side.\n\n\"I found out half of it. This friend of mine also accidentally overheard something incomplete. They said our special investigator coming to Baofan District this time was temporarily seconded, and they're still an intern investigator. As for who it is, they don't know.\"\n\n\"An intern investigator? An intern investigator coming to Baofan District? Isn't that suicide? Or did they offend someone? Made a mistake? Were they deliberately sent here?\"\n\nBei Heguang gave him a look as if he were an idiot, \"Could it not be that these two intern investigators are exceptionally formidable, so they were exceptionally assigned here?\"\n\nMing Jun pondered, \"It's possible, but those formidable characters don't seem likely. Among the tough intern investigators, there are only a few. First and foremost is Bai Hemian, but he's still confined.\"\n\n\"Then there's Tantai Xianyue; she caused such a huge stir in Ninglong City, so it's impossible for her to come back.\"\n\n\"As for the others, they've all been promoted to official investigators, so they don't fit.\"\n\n\"You forgot one, the one famous from Baiyao Ancient Town, who killed Yuan Baifeng, the Corpse-Dissolving Grand God, on the highway—Lu Ding.\"\n\nThat name had been making waves since last night. Although the two were annoyed, they had heard the rumors.\n\nPerfect assessment score. He killed Zhaoxuan and the Spirit Sea, leaving no complete corpses.\n\nAll these titles sounded harrowing.\n\nMing Jun shook his head, \"I don't think it's likely. There's no undeserved reputation, but Lu Ding just completed a mission yesterday and caused such a huge commotion. He even let Wen Yuquan release the news about using the Wind-Settling Pearl. Now Wen Yuquan and Yin Feng are still on administrative leave. It's impossible for him to be transferred to Baofan District alone. At the very least, he'd be paired with an official investigator. Two interns? I really can't imagine any formidable individuals.\"\n\nHis analysis was logical and well-reasoned, sounding plausible.\n\nBei Heguang beside him was also led astray by his words.\n\n\"Alright, alright, just tell me what we should do.\"\n\nMing Jun decided not to think about it anymore, \"It should be intern investigators who are relatively formidable. Here's what we'll do: when the handover personnel arrive, we'll first see if we recognize them. If we don't, we'll immediately give them a stern welcome, make them go back and report that they're not competent for the work in Baofan District.\"\n\n\"That way, we can stall for a few days, and during those days, we'll open the tomb door.\"\n\n\"If we do recognize them, then we'll have a good talk, be polite, and split everything evenly.\"\n\nMing Jun's idea was actually quite good: tailor one's approach to the person, determining one's attitude based on the other person's strength and reputation.\n\nThe plan was perfect.\n\nBut he just missed one crucial point.\n\nNeither he nor Bei Heguang had ever met Lu Ding, nor did they know what he looked like. They only knew of his existence, had heard his name, and knew his nickname.\n\n\"Alright, your method is good; we'll do it this way.\"\n\nThe two were no longer in a hurry to pack their things; they just waited.\n\nSoon, Lu Ding arrived at the entrance with Yan Feifan.\n\nA call was made, and the director of the Baofan District Public Security Bureau and the entire leadership team personally came out to greet them, each wearing a smile, looking incredibly pleased.\n\nThey had finally waited for the new 749 special investigator.\n\nThe previous two, while not entirely bad, certainly weren't good, and during their already short term, they had caused quite a few problems. This time, due to a work error, dozens of ordinary people lost their lives.\n\nIt truly added significant difficulty to their work.\n\nNow, the past was the past, and the new special investigator had arrived. They hoped he would be more reliable.\n\n\"Hello, comrade. I am Gao Zhengliang, Director of the Baofan District Public Security Bureau.\"",

How could you do this to me!!!\n\nYan Feifan watched Gao Zhenliang's smile freeze on his face, then immediately spoke up, slightly indignant: \"Director Gao, aren't official investigators promoted from interns? What, are you planning to have eyes but fail to recognize Mount Tai?\"¹\n\nThe term \"have eyes but fail to recognize Mount Tai\" was used abruptly, but it was precisely for that effect, to be jarring to the listener.\n\nGao Zhenliang's expression instantly returned to normal.\n\n\"I was rash. Living to such an old age, I'm getting more and more muddled. My apologies, two investigators, I offer my apologies to both of you. Shall we go inside and sit to talk?\"\n\n\"It's alright, Director Gao. There's still a long way to go in the future; we can get to know each other slowly.\"\n\nThe crowd dispersed, making way for Lu Ding and his partner.\n\nAt the glass entrance of the Public Security Bureau ahead, Ming Jun watched the situation outside and asked Bei He Guang.\n\n\"How is it? Do you recognize them?\"\n\n\"The one on the right I haven't seen, looks unfamiliar. The one on the left I have a slight impression of, just a regular intern.\"\n\n\"So they are indeed just regular intern investigators. Let's go, give them a show of strength² to make them retreat from difficulties.\"\n\nThe two walked out from either side of the main door, blocking the path of Lu Ding's group.\n\nGao Zhenliang sighed slightly: \"Inspector Bei, Inspector Ming, what are you doing?\"\n\nThe two ignored Gao Zhenliang.\n\n\"Hey! You two intern investigators, coming to take over our official investigator shift, do you have the ability?\"\n\nLu Ding's figure flickered, and in the blink of an eye, he stood before the speaking Ming Jun, looking down at him.\n\nA sense of oppression instantly assailed him.\n\nThe surrounding air seemed to have been sucked out, making him unable to breathe.\n\nMing Jun's face gradually reddened, and illusions appeared before his eyes. At this moment, he seemed to see an upright human-bear, eyes red, rubbing its paws, picking out the good meat on his body, deciding which piece was best to bite into first.\n\nBang!\n\nMing Jun couldn't withstand the pressure and knelt down.\n\nLu Ding's voice rang out.\n\n\"I'm giving you one minute. Disappear from my sight immediately. You only get one chance like this.\"\n\nThe oppressive feeling dissipated, and Ming Jun's clothes were already soaked with sweat.\n\nHe looked as if he had just been pulled out of water.\n\nGao Zhenliang stood nearby, unable to suppress the corners of his mouth.\n\nAlthough he was an ordinary person, he knew a little about Qi Cultivators.\n\nTo be scared like this without even a move being made.\n\nLu Ding's strength was beyond doubt.\n\nHe quickly stepped forward to smooth things over: \"Inspector Lu, the Bureau has prepared a welcome banquet. Do you have any favorite dishes you'd like me to ask the kitchen to add for you?\"\n\nMing Jun raised his head, information intertwining and connecting in his mind: Surname Lu, Intern Investigator... isn't that Lu Ding!\n\nDamn it.\n\nNo wonder he looked unfamiliar, I didn't recognize him at all!!!\n\nI calculated everything, but missed this one point.\n\nMing Jun said, still shaken, \"Are you Corpse-Dissolving Grand Duke Lu Ding?\"\n\n\"Corpse-Dissolving Grand Duke?\"\n\nYan Feifan stepped forward: \"Brother Lu, that's the nickname people outside gave you.\"\n\nLu Ding immediately felt speechless.\n\nThis nickname doesn't sound like a good person's at all.\n\nHe, a dignified 749 Intern Investigator, holding an iron rice bowl³, doing the work of protecting the local populace from the harassment of spirits, monsters, and demons, yet they give him such a nickname.\n\nCorpse-Dissolving Grand Duke.\n\nIt sounds like some demon cultivator or a monster, even.\n\nLu Ding was truly beyond words. He simply walked past Ming Jun, who was still kneeling on the ground, and entered the Public Security Bureau.\n\nAfter he left.\n\nMing Jun looked at Bei He Guang, who was hiding in the corner nearby.\n\n\"Ah Guang!!! Come help me up, I can't stand!\"\n\nBei He Guang scurried over and helped him up: \"Are you alright?\"\n\n\"Alright? You try it and see if you're alright. I even peed a few drops from fright, and you ask if I'm alright.\"\n\nHe struggled to stand up, grumbling: \"It really was Lu Ding who came. What cultivation method does this person practice? How can he be so terrifying? Sure enough, there are only wrong names, no wrong nicknames. It's truly unlucky to have run into him. If I weren't also from 749, just like him, I guess today I'd be in pieces, here and there.\"\n\nLu Ding certainly didn't mean that; if someone wasn't polite, why should he indulge them?\n\nBut to Ming Jun, it became \"almost in pieces.\"\n\n\"It wasn't me, it was your own wild analysis. We haven't seen Lu Ding either; who knew what he looked like?\"\n\n\"Talking after the fact, why didn't you say so earlier?\"\n\nBei He Guang chuckled awkwardly: \"I just remembered.\"\n\n\"Damn it, you hid pretty quickly, making me take it all alone. Come on, let's go find Lu Ding, we'll have a good chat with him.\"\n\n\"No, no, wait a minute, are you crazy? Didn't he tell us to leave in one minute just now? If we go find him now, won't you be disrespecting him?\"\n\n\"What about the ancient tomb?\"\n\n\"We're modern people, can't you use your brain? Add him as a friend on your phone, and talk to him on your phone.\"\n\nMing Jun's eyes lit up: \"This time you weren't talking after the fact. But will he add us? I feel like people like him are usually quite arrogant and hard to get along with.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you add the one next to him? That person looks honest. Adding him and asking him to pass a message should be fine. Let's go, let's leave here first, in case he comes out again later.\"\n\n\"Not getting our stuff?\"\n\n\"Don't bother, it's not worth much money. Let's just leave first.\"\n\nThe two fled the place as if escaping.\n\nUpstairs.\n\nLu Ding declined Director Gao's invitation to the welcome banquet.\n\nHe walked into the office left by Ming Jun and Bei He Guang.\n\nLu Ding sat drinking tea, while Yan Feifan cleaned up and discarded clutter nearby.\n\nEarlier, Director Gao had offered to find a few people to help Yan Feifan, but he had refused.\n\nHe was very clear about his role: doing chores, not fighting.\n\nIf even the chores were taken over by others, wouldn't he be useless? Then what would they need him for?\n\nHe walked out carrying a bag of trash.\n\nWhen Yan Feifan returned, he said, holding his phone: \"Brother Lu, those two official investigators just added me. They want to tell you something through me.\"\n\n\"What kind of matter needs to go through you? I don't eat people; wouldn't it be better to just tell me directly?\"\n\nLu Ding also didn't understand why they were making such a fuss.\n\n\"They're probably scared of you, so they came to me.\" Yan Feifan hit the nail on the head with the correct answer. He continued: \"They said they know where there are treasures and hope to cooperate with you to plan it together.\"\n\n\"Treasures again?\"\n\nLu Ding sat up straight.\n\nHe had felt a slight regret about the Wind-Settling Pearl last time; what was originally a good treasure ultimately became like chicken ribs⁴.\n\nNow that there were treasures again, of course, he wouldn't let them go.\n\n\"Ask what kind of treasure.\"\n___\n¹ **有眼不識泰山 (yǒu yǎn bù shí tài shān)**: Literally \"have eyes but fail to recognize Mount Tai.\" This idiom means to fail to recognize someone important or highly skilled, or to underestimate someone's true worth.\n² **下馬威 (xià mǎ wēi)**: Literally \"dismounting prestige.\" This idiom refers to a show of strength or an intimidating act performed to assert dominance or put someone in their place from the start.\n³ **鐵飯碗 (tiě fàn wǎn)**: Literally \"iron rice bowl.\" This idiom refers to a secure job with guaranteed employment and benefits, often in a government or state-owned enterprise, implying lifelong job security.\n⁴ **雞肋 (jī lèi)**: Literally \"chicken ribs.\" This idiom refers to something that is of little value or benefit, but which one is reluctant to discard. It implies that while there might be some minor use or gain, it's not worth the effort or hassle, similar to how chicken ribs offer little meat but are bothersome to eat.",

    "content": "......\n\n\"They didn't say. They just said 'treasure,' but...\"\n\nThis \"but\" from Yan Feifan made Lu Ding glance over.\n\n\"Since when did you learn to be so suspenseful?\"\n\n\"No, no, Boss Lu. Here's what I was thinking... This Baofan District isn't some remote mountain range. How many places could there be to hide a treasure? It boils down to a few possibilities. First, those two saw something that others failed to recognize for its true worth,¹ but the owner is someone they can't afford to provoke. So they want to cooperate with you and use your skills as their blade, Boss Lu.\"\n\n\"That's highly unlikely. Why would someone they can't afford to provoke have a worse eye for things than them?\"\n\n\"As for the second possibility, it's something inside the tombs of Baofan District. Something that others either failed to find, or found but couldn't take away.\"\n\n\"Personally, I lean towards the latter.\"\n\n\"And based on their behavior today, they're not completely brainless. So I'm guessing they don't want to just hand it over. They want to give us a show of force, make us back off, and buy themselves a few days to plot how to get the treasure inside.\"\n\n\"And this treasure... they can't take it themselves. But they've found it, and maybe others have too, but they must have confirmed that no one has taken it yet. That's why they need to cooperate with you.\"\n\n\"They say treasures go to those destined to have them. The moment you showed up, Boss Lu, this treasure revealed itself. It looks like you're the destined one. I think we shouldn't be in a hurry to reply. We can go check the tomb first. If we find it, you can just take it, Boss Lu, and we'll act like this never happened.\"\n\n\"If we can't find it, then we can talk about cooperating. At that point, you'll have the upper hand, Boss Lu, so of course you'll get first pick of the good stuff. That's the rule. Either way, we don't lose out. What do you think?\"\n\nA smile appeared on Lu Ding's face.\n\nYan Feifan's combat skills might be so-so.\n\nBut his brain worked well.\n\nNo wonder strategists were so sought-after in ancient times.\n\nHaving someone sharp around really made things easier.\n\n\"You're getting smarter and smarter.\"\n\nYan Feifan scratched his head, looking a little embarrassed. \"Well, I've been following you for a while now, Boss Lu. I was bound to learn a thing or two.\"\n\nIt was a well-put phrase, but it wasn't pure flattery.\n\nYan Feifan was a smart man, so he could see that Lu Ding was also very intelligent.\n\nIt was just that his power was even greater.\n\nIf a situation truly called for brainpower, Lu Ding would think of more than he ever could.\n\nFor now, this was his time to shine—to offer strategies for Lu Ding, to find and fix any oversights.\n\nBut Lu Ding heard it differently.\n\nThey say fatuous rulers love sycophantic ministers, and that saying was absolutely right.\n\nHe was finally getting to experience it.\n\n\"Alright, we'll do as you say. There's no time to waste, let's go now.\"\n\n\"Go in broad daylight?\"\n\n\"Why not? We're not tomb raiders; we don't have to wait for nightfall. Our credentials are all legal and above board. Who's going to stop us?\"\n\nThe two immediately pushed the door open to leave.\n\nAs soon as they stepped out, they ran right into Gao Zhengliang.\n\n\"Investigator Lu, perfect timing. I have something to discuss with you.\"\n\n\"Has a special incident occurred?\"\n\n\"No, nothing like that.\"\n\n\"Then never mind. I'm in a hurry right now. Whatever it is, we can talk when I get back.\"\n\nLu Ding's duty was to handle special incidents in the Baofan District.\n\nAs long as it wasn't a special incident, nothing could stop him in his quest for treasure.\n\n\"Hey, hey, hey, Investigator Lu, don't go just yet! The Cao Family Alley, the Four Seas Group, the Five Viscera Society... these Qi Refiner factions in Baofan District want to invite you to dinner.\"\n\nWithout a second thought, Lu Ding refused. \"No need. Please turn them down for me, Bureau Chief Gao. I don't have time for dinner right now.\"\n\nGao Zhengliang grew anxious. \"Investigator Lu, these are the 'local snakes'—the Qi Refiner factions of our district. If you don't go, it'll be difficult for you to carry out your work in the future.\"\n\nHe himself didn't really care.\n\nThese people, however powerful, wouldn't dare challenge a government agency.\n\nHe was mainly worried for Lu Ding.\n\nGao Zhengliang had only just met Lu Ding, but he could see the man had real skills.\n\nIf Lu Ding did well, the public order in Baofan District would improve.\n\nIf his work went smoothly, the work of the Baofan District Public Security Bureau would go more smoothly as well.\n\nThe two were complementary.\n\nThat was why Gao Zhengliang was so anxious.\n\nLu Ding could also tell the man was looking out for him.\n\n\"Then tell them to reschedule. I really am busy today. Oh, and Bureau Chief Gao, please trouble yourself to send me a list of the Qi Refiners in our district. I'm leaving now.\"\n\nYan Feifan added from behind, \"Thank you for your trouble, Bureau Chief Gao. Boss Lu really is in a hurry. Our apologies.\"\n\n\"Sigh... Fine, fine. A big-shot bureau chief like me, still running errands. Oh, my old back...\"\n\nGao Zhengliang tactfully relayed Lu Ding's message to the various factions.\n\n[Cao Family Alley, Cao Yuan: Since Investigator Lu is busy, we will arrange another time. Please trouble Bureau Chief Gao to let him know that Cao Family Alley welcomes his esteemed presence at any time.]\n\n[Four Seas Group, Xie Shunan: Thank you for passing on the message, Bureau Chief Gao. Investigator Lu must be occupied with important matters; it was presumptuous of us at the Four Seas Group. Whenever Investigator Lu has a free moment and thinks of us, we can have that meal then.]\n\nLooking at the replies from Cao Family Alley and the Four Seas Group, Gao Zhengliang flicked the ash from his cigarette. \"This Lu Ding really is different from the other investigators.\"\n\nIn the past, when official 749 investigators came to patrol, incidents like today's were not unheard of.\n\nIf you didn't give them face, then there was nothing more to be said.\n\nThese Baofan District Qi Refiner factions would just feign compliance, obstructing your work and giving you the runaround whenever you asked for anything.\n\nIf you tried to make trouble, they'd meet you head-on.\n\nIt had escalated before, but it always ended inconclusively. The 749 management insisted on doing everything by the book, emphasizing fairness and justice.\n\nBut with fairness, justice, and a state of non-interference, you couldn't properly carry out patrol work. There were many things you needed their cooperation for.\n\nThe dinner was just a pretext; what was important was probing each other's attitudes.\n\nYou didn't need to give them anything tangible or make any promises, you just had to show the right attitude.\n\nIf this were like before, these people wouldn't have had this attitude at all. How could they possibly be so polite after Lu Ding turned them down?\n\nGao Zhengliang found it bizarre.\n\n\"An intern investigator who's more effective than an official one. How strange is that, heh.\"\n\nThen, another message came in.\n\nGao Zhengliang chuckled. \"Now that's more like it. This is how they usually are.\"\n\nHe then screenshotted the message and sent it to Lu Ding and Yan Feifan.\n\nIt read:\n\n[Five Viscera Society, Tang Hu: Who the hell does this Lu Ding think he is? We invite him to dinner and he pushes it back? What makes him so high and mighty? Is he trying to pull that 'new official's three fires'² crap on us? We offer him some respect, and he spits in our faces. The Corpse-Dissolving Taisui, my ass. Ptooey. Tell him to watch his back.]\n\nJust as Gao Zhengliang sent the screenshot, the other party retracted the message and sent a new one.\n\n[Bureau Chief Gao, this is Tang Bao of the Five Viscera Society. My second brother has had too much to drink. Please just pretend you didn't see that.]\n\nGao Zhengliang stubbed out his cigarette. \"Pretend I didn't see it? Not a chance. I'm not some venting machine for you to take your frustrations out on at my age. You dared to curse the man, so don't be afraid of him seeing it. I didn't add or embellish anything. Besides, you're the one who said it, not me.\"\n\nHe was a bureau chief, after all; everyone has a temper.\n\nAlthough Qi Refiners weren't under his jurisdiction, who could he blame for getting such a tough partner this time?\n\nGao Zhengliang had lived a long life, and today, he was going to borrow the tiger's might.³\n\n\"'The Corpse-Dissolving Taisui'... that name has quite the murderous aura. I need another cigarette.\"\n\n*Click.* A flame ignited. A puff of smoke drifted out.\n\n***\n\n¹Original idiom is 有眼不識金鑲玉 (yǒu yǎn bù shí jīn xiāng yù), literally \"to have eyes but fail to recognize gold inlaid with jade.\" It means to be unable to recognize a valuable person or thing.\n\n²Original idiom is 新官上任三把火 (xīn guān shàng rèn sān bǎ huǒ), referring to a new leader making a strong show of authority upon taking a position.\n\n³Original idiom is 狐假虎威 (hú jiǎ hǔ wēi), \"the fox borrows the tiger's might,\" which refers to using the authority or power of others to intimidate people.",

    "content": "On the way to the ancient tomb.\n\nLu Ding looked at the message from Director Gao on his phone.\n\nHe silently noted down the name Tang Hu of Wuzang Sengshe.\n\nLikes to talk trash, huh?\n\nWe'll have a chance to meet.\n\nThey arrived at a small park that had already been cordoned off. Lu Ding had just shown his ID and was about to enter.\n\nYan Feifan, lagging half a step behind, also saw the message on his phone.\n\n\"Brother Lu, this Wuzang Sengshe is the weakest among the three factions, yet they dare to be so arrogant. Shouldn't we teach them a lesson?\"\n\nWuzang Sengshe, one of the Qi Refiner factions in Baofan District.\n\nIts members are mostly Chuma Disciples or frenzied Daoists from Wild Maoshan, all of whom came from various places to Yunhai to earn money and do business, eventually banding together and settling here.\n\nThey usually handle things like feng shui readings, warding off evil, ghost catching, fortune fixing, and so on. They also sell small magical artifacts and the like, not fit for polite society.\n\nAmong them, the Dragon-Tiger-Leopard Trio are in charge.\n\nThese three are also Chuma Disciples. The eldest, Tang Long, carries the Fallen Dragon Immortal, an old loach that became a spirit. It's unknown how many years it cultivated, but it's just one step away from becoming fully fledged.\n\nThe second, Tang Hu, by a lucky coincidence encountered a tiger descending the mountain. Luckily, not only was he not eaten, but he also became the Chuma conduit for this descending tiger.\n\nThe third, Tang Bao, is said to have accidentally gotten lost in the mountains as a child and was picked up and raised for several years by a leopard that had lost its cub. Eventually, the leopard became a spirit and attained enlightenment, and he also became the leopard's attendant.\n\nInterestingly, both Eldest Brother Tang Long and Second Brother Tang Hu became Chuma attendants while searching for Tang Bao. The three brothers also came together. Later, they even changed their names together to the Dragon-Tiger-Leopard Trio and came to Yunhai.\n\n\"No rush. Once things here are handled, I will personally go to his doorstep to tell him who my 'three fires of a new official'¹ are meant for.\"\n\nLu Ding didn't care about the other enforcement officers. But since he was here, if you're a dragon, you must lie down; if you're a tiger, you must coil². He hadn't provoked these people, yet they came to provoke him first.\n\nThen let's have a good play. Everyone, stay busy.\n\nStepping past the cordon, he walked inside. The vast park was divided into two areas. In the outer area, scientific researchers were excavating the entire ancient tomb with small brushes and shovels. Further in, it was guarded by another group of people.\n\nSeeing a stranger approaching, they quickly stepped forward to intercept him.\n\n\"Do you have a pass!?\"\n\n\"No entry without a pass.\"\n\nLu Ding pulled out his ID and handed it over: \"Can this get me in?\"\n\nThe man took it and opened it. On it, the two characters 'Guo'an'³ were clearly written, and a steel stamp was affixed. The man's hand trembled slightly. No matter how arrogant he was, encountering Guo'an would make him numb. It was fortunate he wasn't a Qi Refiner; otherwise, seeing the three characters '749,' he would probably be even more numb.\n\nIn the current era, the power of the three characters '749' is no less than that of the ancient Jinyiwei⁴. \"Execute first, report later; imperial authority granted\"⁵. Obstructing official duties, killing them would just be killing them.\n\nThe man said with a troubled expression: \"Officer... This place already belongs to our Sihai Group. It's not according to regulations for you to enter without a pass. If I let you in, I'll also be in trouble.\"\n\nLu Ding pulled out a pistol from behind his waist and chambered a round. \"This, can it get me in!\"\n\nLooking at the dark gun barrel, the man no longer dared to obstruct and quickly nodded: \"Yes, you can enter, you can enter, please enter freely.\" He was really afraid that if he said a few more words, the person would really dare to put a bullet through him. Obstructing Guo'an from carrying out official duties was no joke.\n\nHe took the ID the man respectfully handed back. Lu Ding tucked the pistol back into his waistband and walked into the actual collapse zone.\n\nAfter he left, the man pulled out his phone and quickly sent a message.\n\n[Brother Xuan, Guo'an is here. They even showed their gun. Couldn't stop them. They've gone in now. Probably be with you guys soon.]\n\nYe Xuan looked at the message on his phone, then looked at another one: dynamite and a construction team would be entering soon. He clicked his tongue.\n\n\"What is Guo'an doing here?\"\n\nYe Xuan, male, nineteen years old, a Qi Refiner from Dabeishan. Speaking of Dabeishan, its glorious days would have to be counted back a hundred years or more.\n\nBefore, this place was a monster's den and a bandit's lair. Later, the Great Han suppressed bandits, and only then did they pacify this place. After that, this place returned to normal; though monsters still rampaged – these things couldn't be eradicated – the bandits who plundered homes were gone.\n\nThere were only those strongmen who still lived there, the batch who surrendered relatively early. They were all Qi Refiners who didn't oppose the state, nor accept state reorganization. They just lived on Dabeishan, didn't go anywhere, nor concerned themselves with worldly affairs, just living their own lives well.\n\nYe Xuan was taught by them. Now that he was of similar age, there was no future for young people staying on Dabeishan, so they let him go down the mountain to venture out.\n\nCoincidentally, those on Dabeishan had some connections with the four founders of Sihai Group, so they told him to come to Yunhai to seek refuge.\n\nAs a result, not long after arriving in Yunhai, he heard that a sinkhole had appeared somewhere here, and Ye Xuan, being highly skilled and bold, prepared to come and see. Just then, a White-Mane Howler ran out. Although this thing was a monster, its teeth were a rare and excellent material. Ye Xuan easily dealt with it.\n\nThen came the ancient tomb dispute. He solved the White-Mane Howler problem that Ming Jun and the other person couldn't. According to the rules, this place should be his. Then, two against one, Ming Jun and Bei Hegang simply couldn't defeat him. They could only concede the place; although the two of them didn't have control over this place, they could still enter anytime. This was Ye Xuan's gesture of goodwill towards 749.\n\nYe Xuan, who had obtained the ancient tomb's development rights, immediately handed this place over to Xie Shunan of Sihai Group. As for himself, he became a security captain and also searched for treasures within the ancient tomb. Though he found some, they weren't of much use, until he discovered the tomb chamber that Ming Jun and his group had found.\n\nYe Xuan was certain there was something good inside. In the following time, he was similar to Ming Jun and his group, having tried every method he could think of, but it wouldn't open, wouldn't open no matter what. With no other option, Ye Xuan could only inform Xie Shunan. After several days of attempts later, they had originally planned to blast the tomb chamber today.\n\nWho knew that today 749 suddenly wanted to replace the enforcement officer? They heard that the replacement was a ruthless character named Lu Ding. Although he was only an intern investigator, he was able to kill the Linghai-level Qi Refiner Yuan Baifeng with his Zhaoxuan-level cultivation. He even gained the moniker 'Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke'⁶.\n\nXie Shunan then went to invite this Lu Ding for a meal. Ye Xuan was somewhat displeased! In his opinion, what Lu Ding could do, he could also do, and he and Lu Ding were of similar age. The only difference was, the other came from an official family and was an intern investigator for 749. While he, Ye Xuan, was an outlaw. From Dabeishan.\n\nIf it weren't for this background that prevented him from joining 749, Ye Xuan estimated that if he went to 749, they would be scrambling to recruit him.\n\n\"It was just that Lu Ding had good luck and became famous a bit earlier. When I become famous, let's see if you still dare to not look at me properly!!\"\n\nAs early as when he descended the mountain, the old men in the village told him to get to know Xie Shunan well, and if possible, to create a beautiful romance would be best.\n\nAlthough Sihai Group was a large and powerful enterprise, Dabeishan was not to be trifled with⁷ either. At worst, those old men with half their bodies in the grave could come out again to back him up.\n\nYe Xuan also liked Xie Shunan very much; she was good-looking, had a good figure, was capable and rich, and smart too. All her qualities were top-notch selections. Which man wouldn't be tempted upon seeing such a woman? He, of course, was no exception.\n***\n¹ *Three fires of a new official*: A Chinese idiom (新官上任三把火) referring to a new official vigorously demonstrating their authority and resolve when taking office.\n² *If you're a dragon, you must lie down; if you're a tiger, you must coil*: An idiom indicating absolute dominance, forcing even powerful figures to submit.\n³ *Guo'an*: Short for \"National Security\" (国家安全), referring to China's Ministry of State Security.\n⁴ *Jinyiwei*: The Embroidered Uniform Guard, a powerful secret police and intelligence agency during China's Ming Dynasty, known for its extensive powers and extrajudicial capabilities.\n⁵ *Execute first, report later; imperial authority granted*: An idiom (先斩后奏，皇权特许) describing absolute power, where one has the authority to act without prior approval, often granted by the highest authority.\n⁶ *Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke*: \"Tai Sui\" (太岁) refers to the Grand Duke Jupiter, a constellation of stars in Chinese astrology and folk religion, believed to influence human fate.

    "content": "Therefore, when Ye Xuan knew that Xie Shunnan was so attentive to Lu Ding, he was quite unhappy in his heart.\n\nBut later, hearing that Lu Ding had an urgent matter and canceled the dinner, he became happy again. Secretly, he grumbled in his heart that Lu Ding didn't know what was good for him. He looked forward to Xie Shunnan bringing the demolition team later to open the tomb chamber with him.\n\nWhile he was still fantasizing there, Lu Ding had already rounded the corner and saw Ye Xuan sitting on a folding stool in the middle of the main road. That air of banditry couldn't be controlled; it was overflowing outwards. He sat grandly, with an air of \"This mountain is mine, this tree is mine; if you want to pass, leave your toll money.\"\n\nYan Feifan leaned in and said cautiously, \"Brother Lu, this person was on the Qi Refiner data that Bureau Chief Gao just sent over; his name is Ye Xuan. He's from the Black Mountain bandit's den and has a deep connection with the Four Seas Group. He was also the one who killed the White-Furred Roar, and single-handedly fought two to seize the development rights for the collapsed ancient tomb area.\"\n\n\"But meeting him is not as good as hearing about him; no matter how you look at him, he seems a bit unintelligent.\"\n\nLu Ding had the same feeling. What normal person would sit in the middle of the main road in broad daylight, giggling foolishly? Lu Ding couldn't be bothered to deal with this person. He walked straight past him.\n\n\"Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm talking to you two! Didn't you see there's someone here, trying to go straight in? Do you think this is your home's heated brick bed? Get out, get out!\" Ye Xuan didn't even get up; he just waved his hand outwards from his folding stool, shooing them away. He had the air of an old residential complex's security guard stopping a food delivery guy.\n\n\"749 is at work; bystanders, please step back.\" Yan Feifan said, showing his ID.\n\nYe Xuan stood up, sensing the aura of fellow Qi Refiners emanating from them. \"749? Aren't you two National Security?\"\n\nLu Ding was speechless; this person came down from the mountains and learned absolutely no common sense. To ordinary people, 749's ID looks like National Security, but to Qi Refiners, it looks like 749.\n\n\"Fine, whether you're National Security or 749, the development rights for this place were lost to me by your 749 Baofan District Enforcer. Now this place belongs to me. National Security or 749, neither is allowed — in.\"\n\nWatching Ye Xuan's arrogant attitude, Yan Feifan took a step back. He knew this person was about to be in trouble. Brother Lu hated it most when someone was more arrogant than him.\n\nAs he expected, Lu Ding's voice rang out the next second. \"So, this place was won by you?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Ye Xuan folded his arms.\n\nLu Ding's tone was indifferent: \"Then can I also snatch it from your hands?\"\n\nYe Xuan's expression turned serious; at this point, how could he not understand? These two were just here to get even and stir up trouble. \"If you have the ability, you can try. But let me say this upfront, if anything happens later, just say you bumped into it yourself.\"\n\nThey were all Qi Refiners; their skills were meant to be used. There's no need for so much talk; if you're not convinced, just fight. Ye Xuan assumed a stance, tiger claws forward, crane beak behind. Lu Ding looked at his movements and commented, \"Tiger-Crane Double Form? It's a bit of a superficial display.\"\n\nDuring this period, whenever Lu Ding had time, he would read various documents and materials from the bureau. He knew deeply that learning has no end, and there's no harm in learning a bit more. Coincidentally, Lu Ding had seen the Tiger-Crane Double Form in the bureau's materials not long ago. But compared to the bureau's records of the old masters' Tiger-Crane Double Form, Ye Xuan was a bit lacking.\n\nHearing this person call his skill a superficial display, Ye Xuan couldn't help but feel a little annoyed: \"It's enough to beat you!\"\n\nThe tiger form was fierce and powerful, the crane form agile and nimble. He probed forward with a tiger claw; Lu Ding raised his hand, forming a claw, and struck back. Ye Xuan sneered inwardly. His tiger claw could even leave marks on fine steel. This person was colliding with him with a bare hand; had he gone mad? This is good too; I'll teach you a lesson, let you understand what it means to suffer for your words! He also made up his mind that as soon as his tiger claw was firmly latched on, he would immediately apply a second burst of force, shatter this person's finger bones, and make him remember well.\n\nBut imagination was beautiful, reality was cruel. The instant their palms collided, Ye Xuan only felt as if a large iron pincer had gripped his palm. His expression changed.\n\n\"Wait!!\"\n\nLu Ding wouldn't wait for him. After firmly gripping Ye Xuan's palm, he applied a second burst of force, tens of thousands of *jin*¹ of terrifying power, then twisted and swung with skillful force to immobilize him. With several *kacha kacha* sounds, all the bones in Ye Xuan's entire arm were dislocated on the spot. His five finger bones were directly pulverized.\n\nOld generations of snake catchers had a technique: after catching a venomous snake, they would hold its tail and swing it. After a few swings, skilled snake catchers would use subtle force to swing the venomous snake, making its whole body dislocate, but the snake would still be alive, just unable to move. Lu Ding used this very technique. Although he hadn't learned it, he had seen a video on the miscellaneous talk interface of the 749 APP. Lu Ding, who possessed the \"Formless\" ability and could activate the \"Heaven-Man Unity\" state, understood most of it just by looking at it once. After all, this wasn't anything profound; it was just the application of subtle force.\n\nLu Ding pursued again, pulling Ye Xuan's arm with immense force, dragging him over, then struck his chest with a horizontal elbow. With just one strike, Ye Xuan's qi and blood surged upwards from the impact. He flew backward, stumbling and rolling on the ground for over ten meters before stabilizing himself and getting up. A trace of fresh blood overflowed from the corner of his mouth. His right arm hung limply by his side, his fingers twisted into a pretzel-like shape.\n\nYe Xuan endured the pain and said, \"Sir, wasn't your hand a bit too vicious? We were only sparring.\"\n\n\"Don't give me that nonsense. Don't think I can't tell what you wanted to do. If I were weaker than you, I'd be the one crippled right now.\" The instant their hands met, Lu Ding sensed this person's intentions. It was just that he was too weak; he just couldn't twist himself. Now talking about being vicious, what is it if not a joke?\n\nYan Feifan added a jab from the side, \"Vicious? If Brother Lu hadn't held back, you'd be in pieces by now. You should be secretly happy to have kept your small life.\"\n\nYe Xuan gritted his teeth. \"I have experienced your esteemed skills. The mountains are high and the roads are long; please, Sir, leave your name. Ye Xuan will surely repay you another day.\"\n\n\"It's over.\" This person couldn't let it go. Yan Feifan silently sighed. He lost, so he lost; why say such words? \"You truly think you've lived too long, don't you?\"\n\n\"Then you probably won't have a future!\" Lu Ding's killing intent leaked out, and an airtight sense of oppression enveloped Ye Xuan from all directions. At this moment, he felt as if he was drowning in a bottomless canyon abyss, with no chance of ever seeing the light of day again.\n\nIf Ye Xuan had retreated then, Lu Ding would have treated it as if nothing had happened. But he absolutely shouldn't have said such words. Lu Ding instantly erupted, the ground beneath his feet crumbling. His entire being rushed forth like a ferocious ancient beast, pouncing and crushing. Ye Xuan only felt that his death was imminent. His life flashed before his eyes.\n\n\"Enforcer Lu, please spare him!!!\" someone shouted loudly. The ground trembled, and tough earthen walls inexplicably rose from the ground, blocking Lu Ding's path. With his charge, these earthen walls instantly shattered like tofu dregs. Although they couldn't withstand Lu Ding's assault, they could slow him down. It was also during this time that a short old man appeared in front of Ye Xuan.\n\n---\n¹ *Jin*: A traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kilograms or 1.1 pounds.",

    "content": "......\n\nLu Ding smashed through the last earthen wall blocking his path.\n\nHis whole body was like a flying bear pouncing on its prey.\n\nFacing the old man.\n\nLu Ding's voice, laced with killing intent, rang out.\n\n\"Threatening a 749 law enforcement officer, obstructing justice—for your multiple offenses, come on, block this!!\"\n\nHe struck out with a palm!!\n\nThe old man formed a hand seal and channeled his qi, and armor formed from gathered rock and earth fitted itself to his body.\n\nHe raised a hand to block.\n\nThe old man was sent flying by Lu Ding's immensely powerful blow.\n\nMost of the armor on his body shattered.\n\nLu Ding landed, spun around, and his trailing hand swept out in a knife-hand strike. A perfectly good head soared into the sky.\n\nYe Xuan never would have imagined it.\n\nThat a random 749 investigator he'd run into would possess such terrifying combat prowess.\n\nThis wasn't quite what the old men on the mountain had told him.\n\nWeren't they saying that at his age, with his talent, he was already considered a genius?\n\nHow had he lost his life less than a month after coming down the mountain?\n\nThe headless body toppled to the ground.\n\nLu Ding straightened up and watched as the old man, who he had sent reeling with a palm strike, barely regained his footing.\n\nGazing at the thoroughly dead Ye Xuan.\n\nThe old man's eyes became bloodshot. \"Xiao Ye!!!\"\n\nAt this moment, he didn't know how he would face his old brothers on the mountain.\n\nOver a decade ago, the old man had fled Great Black Mountain after making a mistake. By a twist of fate, he had ended up in Yunhai and joined the Four Seas Group.\n\nHe had thought he'd never have a chance to return to Great Black Mountain.\n\nIt wasn't until Ye Xuan's arrival that the old man understood.\n\nHis old brothers on the mountain had been watching over him all these years.\n\nThey had long since forgiven his past mistakes, and his joining the Four Seas Group had also been arranged by them.\n\nBut now, he had failed to protect his old brothers' only disciple.\n\nAt this very moment, the rage in the old man's heart had reached its peak.\n\n\"Lu Ding!!!!!\"\n\n\"You're too vicious!!!! A disgrace to your title as a 749 investigator!!! Today, I will kill you, rid 749 of a hidden menace, and avenge Ye Xuan!!!\"\n\n\"You old bastard, stop fucking judging me. I'm a 749 investigator, is that Ye Xuan someone who can just threaten me? If you've got the balls, then come kill me. If you don't, then come and die!\"\n\nLu Ding shot right back.\n\nIt wasn't for others to judge his actions. At least Lu Ding had a clear conscience. Who in 749 could match his enthusiasm for slaying demons and monsters?\n\nA disgrace to the 749 investigators!\n\nWas he supposed to let Ye Xuan go after he'd already threatened him, making an enemy for himself and leaving an unpredictable threat that could cause some uncontrollable accident in the future?\n\nLu Ding wasn't capable of doing something so idiotic.\n\nHe would only ever crush all potential threats in the cradle.\n\nThe old man formed a hand seal, pressing it to the ground.\n\n\"Yellow Marsh Demarcation!!!\"\n\nThe solid ground instantly turned into a yellow mud swamp.\n\nThe old man stood upon the marsh.\n\nFrom their brief exchange, he had already discovered that it was nearly impossible for him to win against Lu Ding in terms of raw power.\n\nBut power comes from the ground; you need a place to leverage your strength to use it, right?\n\nAnd Lu Ding was only at the Zhaoxuan Realm; logically speaking, he absolutely shouldn't be able to fly.\n\nAs long as he changed the environment and left him with no leverage, he could seize the home-field advantage and suppress him with the terrain.\n\nCoupled with his own strength, a full realm higher, he would have the advantage in human ability.\n\nThe right time, the right place, the right people—he held two of the three.\n\nNo matter how terrifying Lu Ding's power was, he wouldn't be able to use even fifty percent of it, while he himself could exert one hundred and twenty percent of his own.\n\nUnder these conditions, the old man didn't know how he could possibly lose.\n\nBut for all his calculations, he had never imagined that Lu Ding could actually fly.\n\nHe just watched as Lu Ding slowly floated up, standing erect in the air.\n\nThe old man's expression froze. How could he fly?\n\nHe was a Zhaoxuan Realm practitioner, on what grounds could he fly?!\n\nOutside the marsh, Xie Shunan of the Four Seas Group wore a grave expression. She was the one who had previously called out for Lu Ding to spare the man.\n\nRight now, Xie Shunan was extremely vexed.\n\nHow did things escalate to this point?\n\nShe had originally planned to invite Lu Ding to dinner today to probe his attitude, but Lu Ding had turned her down. Xie Shunan hadn't thought much of it; it was normal for capable people to have a temper.\n\nBut she had never expected it.\n\nTo see Lu Ding again in the collapsed zone.\n\nAnd not only that, Lu Ding had come to blows with Ye Xuan, and the savage aura he leaked was truly frightening to her.\n\nShe had also determined that Ye Xuan was definitely no match for Lu Ding.\n\nBut she hadn't thought Lu Ding would kill Ye Xuan outright.\n\nAnd now Elder Huang was facing off against Lu Ding, looking for all the world like they were in a fight to the death!\n\nRegarding Ye Xuan's death.\n\nXie Shunan didn't actually care that much.\n\nShe had no real connection to Ye Xuan. If the elders in her family hadn't said something, she probably wouldn't have even bothered with him. She found his thuggish air very unsettling.\n\nIt always felt like Ye Xuan was living in the old era of mountain bandits.\n\nThey weren't cut from the same cloth.\n\nLater, when Ye Xuan acquired the development rights to this ancient tomb, Xie Shunan's opinion of him hadn't changed much.\n\nTaking this place was a curse, not a blessing.\n\nThe Four Seas Group wouldn't advance another step just by having this one extra place and its contents, nor would it fall behind by not having it.\n\nThe reason she was here keeping an eye on things...\n\n...wasn't because she was interested in what was inside the tomb.\n\nIt was so that if anything, or any treasure, appeared, she could immediately make the decision to hand it over to 749 or take charge of the situation.\n\nSome things couldn't be taken lightly.\n\nIt was easy to offend people.\n\nBut who knew something like this would happen.\n\n\"Elder Huang, please, calm down.\"\n\nXie Shunan still wanted to persuade Elder Huang not to be rash. Whether he won or lost, it wouldn't be a good thing.\n\nSo what if he beat Lu Ding?\n\nKill him? And then be hunted by 749?\n\nLet him go? And wait for him to return for revenge after he grows stronger?\n\nAnd if he couldn't beat Lu Ding, then based on the rumors and what she had just witnessed, there was only one outcome for Elder Huang: death.\n\nSo no matter what he did, the outcome for Elder Huang would not be good.\n\nAnd it would drag the Four Seas Group into the investigation.\n\nBut the old man wouldn't listen at all.\n\n\"Miss Xie, don't try to persuade me anymore. I have failed Great Black Mountain, failed those old brothers. They entrusted Ye Xuan to me, but I didn't watch over him properly. The debt has its debtor, the wrong has its source. He killed Ye Xuan, so I will kill him to avenge Ye Xuan. Afterwards, I will go to 749 and turn myself in!!\"\n\n\"Kill me?\"\n\nA mocking look appeared on Lu Ding's face. \"On what grounds? On this Great Farmland Transformation Technique of yours?\"\n\nYan Feifan covered his face, wanting to laugh but not daring to.\n\n*What time is it for jokes, Brother Lu?*\n\nBut looking closely, there was water, mud, and it was soft and messy. It really did look like a farmer's field.\n\nLu Ding crooked a finger at the old man. \"Come on. Come kill me.\"\n\n\"You're courting death!!!!\"\n\nTwo mud dragons flew out from the marsh, lunging at Lu Ding from the left and right to swallow him.\n\nThe old man didn't expect these mud dragons to pose any real threat to Lu Ding.\n\nHe only hoped they could stall for a little while, to give him enough time to accumulate power.\n\nBut in the blink of an eye.\n\nLu Ding's figure vanished from his sight.\n\nThe sound of wind whipped past his ear. \"What era is this? Who still uses a casting delay.\"\n\nLu Ding had appeared beside him out of nowhere, his leg lashing out in a powerful, whistling roundhouse kick.\n\nThe old man had no choice but to break his hand seal.\n\nSwiping his hand through the air, he caused the surface of the mud marsh to ripple and surge, solidifying into a thick earthen wall to block Lu Ding's attack.\n\nBOOM!!!\n\nWith one kick.\n\nRubble flew everywhere.\n\nThe mud beneath the old man's feet solidified into a platform, carrying him backward.\n\nThen the mud reformed into a hand, lifting the old man and tossing him dozens of meters into the air. He formed a hand seal, and the spiritual qi in his body surged.\n\nThe mud pit roiled, and a foul stench billowed out as its color changed from yellow to black.\n\n\"Death Mire Burial Kill!!!\"",

    "content": "...\n\nThe mud pit instantly exploded. Countless torrents of black sludge churned into the sky, surging toward Lu Ding to engulf him.\n\nThe old man's hands formed another seal.\n\nFrom within the ball of black mud, Lu Ding’s voice came, unhurried and calm. \"I already said it. These days, that whole schtick of stalling for time and using a long wind-up to charge a finishing move just doesn't fly anymore.\"\n\n\"Shatter for me!!!\"\n\nA fist, wrapped in terrifyingly immense force, directly smashed the mud sphere entrapping Lu Ding.\n\nHe was seen opening his palm.\n\nA light breeze stirred through the air.\n\n\"Slash!\"\n\nHundreds of slashes from every direction hacked toward the old man from all sorts of tricky angles.\n\nEach strike carried a sharpness sufficient to dismember a Qi Refiner of the same realm.\n\nElder Huang waved his hands and twisted his body, mobilizing the spirit qi within him to cast his techniques.\n\nBeside him, the mud at his feet continuously changed states.\n\nForming a shield, raising a wall, piling into a mountain, it relentlessly blocked Lu Ding’s volley of slashes for the old man surnamed Huang.\n\nThe longer he fought, the more shocked the old man became.\n\nSpeed, strength, ranged attacks, close combat—aside from his cultivation realm, he held no advantage in any category.\n\nHe had only heard that this Lu Ding’s physical body was strong, but the rumors outside never said his speed and ranged techniques were this powerful as well.\n\nNow, the old man finally understood why that Yuan Baifeng had died at Lu Ding's hands.\n\nFrom inside to out, from top to bottom, there wasn't a single flaw.\n\nHe couldn't win! Today, his defeat was certain.\n\nLu Ding countered him too perfectly—no, Lu Ding countered *most* Qi Refiners.\n\nUnless it was an exceptional monster just like him.\n\nOnly someone who could advance both their physical body and their techniques to a profound level could stand and fight him.\n\nIf an ordinary Qi Refiner were to encounter Lu Ding...\n\nThose skilled in techniques, like himself, would be disrupted, unable to build up their finishing moves, and be killed up close.\n\nEven if they luckily managed to avoid close combat, it would be like drinking poison to quench thirst—a slow death.\n\nA prolonged defense is bound to have a breach. The moment Lu Ding seized an opportunity, with his terrifying power, a single blow could decide the victor.\n\nAs for Qi Refiners who specialized in physical strength, they would be harassed by his strange and sharp slashes, forced to defend passively.\n\nAnd on top of that, he also knew a secret flying technique.\n\nIt would be extremely difficult for a physically strong Qi Refiner to get close enough to fight him.\n\nEven if they did manage to break through to close range, Lu Ding's own physical strength was terrifying. There would be little suspense as to who would emerge victorious.\n\nThe old man truly couldn't fathom how one person could be so well-rounded in every aspect.\n\nWill, spirit, talent—were these things an inexhaustible resource for him?\n\nThe signs of defeat became apparent.\n\nThe old man's defense finally revealed a flaw, and a slash took the opportunity to cut through.\n\nBlood sprayed as an arm flew into the air.\n\nThe old man grit his teeth against the pain, not uttering a sound. Then, he saw Yan Feifan standing nearby.\n\nA vicious look filled his eyes as he charged straight for Yan Feifan.\n\nYan Feifan shuddered in fright.\n\n\"Don't come after me!!!\"\n\nHe turned and started running.\n\nBut his strength was too low. Just as the old man was about to grab him, Yan Feifan sank directly into the hard ground, and the old man grabbed at empty air.\n\n\"Hehe, old timer. Your back is wide open. Get ready to glug glug glug...\"\n\nResentment flashed in the old man's eyes.\n\nHis vision fell. He saw his own upright, headless body, blood spurting from the neck.\n\n\"Is that my body? I guess I've gotten this old...\"\n\nLu Ding landed, grabbing Yan Feifan, who had nearly drowned in the earth, and pulling him up.\n\n\"Bleargh~~ Bleargh~~~ Bleargh... Brother Lu... I need to get my stomach pumped... bleargh...\"\n\n\"Why go through all that trouble?\"\n\nLu Ding held him upside down and shook him a few times. Yan Feifan vomited even more violently; he almost threw up his entire stomach.\n\nOnly after he had more or less finished did Lu Ding put him down.\n\n\"That... that old geezer was a real idiot, trying to grab me...\" Yan Feifan said, panting as he sat collapsed on the ground.\n\nLu Ding looked at his sorry state and couldn't help but say, \"You really should learn how to swim. I'm honestly afraid you'll drown in the ground one of these days.\"\n\n\"Or you could learn to control earth like that old man.\"\n\n\"Bro, my power is phasing through things, not controlling elements. I can't do that.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine.\"\n\nLu Ding looked up at the silent Xie Shunan.\n\n\"Shouldn't the Four Seas Group be giving me an explanation?\"\n\nXie Shunan looked Lu Ding straight in the eye. \"Patrol Officer Lu, you heard him just now. I advised him to calm down, but he refused to listen. This was the employee's personal decision and has nothing to do with the Four Seas Group. Both myself and the Four Seas Group hold a friendly and benevolent attitude toward you and the 749.\"\n\n\"I am a businesswoman, and the Four Seas Group is a business. We want no part in matters like these.\"\n\n\"Whether you have a part in it or not is something we can discuss later. For now, you can leave.\"\n\nLu Ding directly told her to go.\n\nHe hadn't forgotten why he was here.\n\nIt was best to find the treasure first, to prevent any complications from arising due to delays.\n\n\"Then I shall take my leave. The Four Seas Group welcomes Patrol Officer Lu's esteemed presence at any time.\"\n\nFrom beginning to end, Xie Shunan's expression remained placid, showing no fear, anger, or any other emotion on the surface.\n\nLu Ding really couldn't tell what a person like her was thinking.\n\nBut it was best she harbor no ill intentions toward him.\n\nLu Ding nodded, and Xie Shunan quickly departed.\n\nUpon reaching the luxury car outside the cordon.\n\nXie Shunan slammed her fist on the steering wheel, her face instantly turning grim.\n\n\"The young ones are clueless, and the old ones are clueless, too! This whole bunch from Great Black Mountain are nothing but bandits! The times have changed, but they're still the same damn breed!!!\"\n\n\"A bunch of good-for-nothings who only ruin things!\"\n\n\"They never consider the consequences of their actions. You all get to be carefree and just die, leaving me to clean up all the mess.\"\n\nXie Shunan took out her phone and made a call.\n\nA moment later, the other end picked up.\n\n\"Dad, tell Grandpa I'm not going to be the Four Seas Group heir anymore. Aren't there three others? Let them fight over it. I'm done with this. Whoever wants the job can have it. And as for the people from Great Black Mountain, don't you ever introduce a single one of them to me again. I don't want to know who's who, how powerful they are, or how glorious their past once was.\"\n\n\"What era do they think this is? Their whole act is completely outdated.\"\n\nThe person on the other end was silent for a long while before speaking.\n\n\"Nannan, what happened?\"\n\nControlling her emotions, Xie Shunan told her father everything that had happened in full detail.\n\nThe man on the other end of the phone took a moment before replying.\n\n\"Our family will no longer involve itself with the Great Black Mountain matter. Lu Ding's talent is too monstrous, and his methods and temperament are extremely ruthless. He is decisive and doesn't mess around. A person like that is dangerous. Making an enemy of him isn't worth it; we have no conflict of interest.\"\n\n\"Here's what we'll do. I'll have someone inquire about his preferences. As for the matter of an apology and an explanation, our Xie family will give him both face and substance.\"¹\n\nXie Shunan gave a noncommittal \"mm,\" hung up, and stomped on the gas pedal.\n\nIt was clear she still hadn't cooled down.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, inside the tomb.\n\nAfter searching for a good while, Lu Ding was finally standing before the tomb chamber door that no one had managed to open.\n\nJust like Ye Xuan and the others, he tried various methods, even resorting to brute force to push the tomb door, but there was no reaction at all.\n\nJust as Lu Ding was at his wit's end, the nearby Yan Feifan spoke up. \"Brother Lu, why don't you let me try? I can phase through walls, so I should be able to get in.\"\n\n***\n¹ A common concept in Chinese culture. Giving \"face\" (面子) means showing public respect and acknowledging his status. Giving \"substance\" (裡子) means providing a genuine, tangible apology or compensation.",

    "content": "...\n\nIt was finally time for Yan Feifan's ability to be put to use.\n\nBut the situation inside was unclear.\n\nMoreover, he wasn't skilled in combat, so Lu Ding was a little worried about him going in alone.\n\nPerhaps sensing his concern, Yan Feifan took a rope out of his bag and started tying it around his waist. \"Brother Lu, don't worry,\" he said. \"I've got this special rope I redeemed from the Bureau. It works with my talent. When I go in, if there's any trouble, I'll just pull the rope. As soon as you feel it move, you can just yank me out!\"\n\n\"How about we just forget it? There's no need to take the risk. We could just sign out some explosives from the Bureau and blow it up all the same.\"\n\nThe main thing was, he was genuinely afraid something would happen to Yan Feifan inside.\n\nThis place was known to have a White-Haired Roarer.\n\nAlthough a monster like the White-Haired Roarer posed no threat to Lu Ding, if Yan Feifan were to run into one, it would be like meeting a living King of Hell—he could get his account deleted and have to start over at any moment.\n\n\"Brother Lu, this might not be pleasant to hear, but you killed Ye Xuan today and also did in that old man at the Spirit Sea Realm. You were too heavy-handed. The higher-ups might punish you for it. With all the time that'll take, someone else might beat us to the punch.\"\n\n\"Delays breed complications. Besides, I can phase through walls. The worst that can happen is I eat a little dirt. Nothing will go wrong.\"\n\nLu Ding understood this reasoning; he had even considered it when he made his move.\n\nBut even so, he wouldn't have held back, nor would he have let those two go.\n\nOnce you've made an enemy and stirred up resentment, if you don't kill them on the spot, you'll just have more trouble later.\n\nEven if the Bureau punished him and said he used excessive force, he would accept it.\n\nHe had to kill Ye Xuan and that old man first, and worry about the rest later!\n\nLu Ding nodded. \"Alright then, be careful. The instant you sense trouble, pull the rope.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Brother Lu.\"\n\nYan Feifan walked forward.\n\nThe solid wall was like a curtain of water, letting him pass right through.\n\nA vast ceremonial plaza came into view. White bones were piled into mountains in various poses, and the ground of the altar was stained with blood that had dried who knows how long ago.\n\nAhead, a massive suspended coffin was bound in the air, its four corners secured by four thick chains.\n\nYan Feifan didn't advance rashly. He scanned his surroundings and saw that aside from the corpses on the altar and the suspended coffin, there was nothing else in the tomb chamber.\n\nFinally, his gaze fell back upon the suspended coffin.\n\n\"If there's really any treasure here, it must be in there.\"\n\n\"But how is Brother Lu supposed to get in...\"\n\nHe could use his wall-phasing ability, but Lu Ding couldn't.\n\nAnd the stone door behind him wouldn't open.\n\nYan Feifan turned, wanting to try and find a mechanism inside that might open the stone door.\n\nHe thought the idea was ridiculous—who would design the mechanism to open a tomb door *inside* the tomb chamber? But in the next second, as he twisted a nearby beast-head carving and the stone door began to rumble open, Yan Feifan came to understand a certain truth.\n\nNever underestimate the way ancient people's minds worked.\n\nThey really did put the mechanism on the inside.\n\nWhat kind of halfwit does that?\n\nThe stone door opened, and Lu Ding saw the strange expression on Yan Feifan's face.\n\n\"Brother Lu, I've really seen it all now. To think someone would put the door mechanism on the inside. Were they afraid the dead would come back to life and not be able to get out...\"\n\nYan Feifan's sarcastic remark came to an abrupt halt.\n\nA look of terror flashed in his eyes.\n\nHe whirled around to look at the suspended coffin.\n\n\"B-Brother Lu... the thing inside... it couldn't still be alive, could it?\"\n\n\"Who knows? What if the tomb's occupant wasn't content to die just like that and left behind some tricks, waiting for the day of his resurrection,\" Lu Ding said as he walked into the tomb chamber, picking up on Yan Feifan's train of thought.\n\nLu Ding had never seen such a case with his own eyes, but the archives of Bureau 749 contained quite a few records of them.\n\nResurrected old monsters.\n\nOld monsters that underwent corpse transformation.\n\nOld monsters who tried to live again, only to become monsters themselves.\n\nNot everyone could calmly accept their own death without pulling some shenanigans.\n\nYan Feifan quietly retreated behind Lu Ding.\n\n\"Brother Lu, what's our next move? Do we go up there? Or should we find a corner, light a candle, and run if it changes color or goes out?\"\n\n\"We're not Tomb Raider Captains. None of that 'man lights the candle, the ghost blows it out' stuff.¹ Rather than us going up, I'd prefer to have it come down.\"\n\nWho knew if going up there would trigger some kind of trap.\n\nYou open the coffin, and bam, you get a point-blank kill you can't even dodge.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand and sent a slash cleaving toward one of the chains holding the suspended coffin.\n\n*Clang!*\n\nThe chain snapped on impact. The suspended coffin swayed, and Lu Ding immediately followed up with a few more slashes.\n\nThe black coffin fell, crashing heavily not far in front of the two, shaking the earth and sending rubble tumbling down.\n\nThe vast ceremonial plaza was smashed and covered in cracks.\n\nLu Ding floated forward.\n\nHe kicked the coffin lid off, revealing the scene within.\n\nA man lay inside, clad in armor, his cape the color of blood. A sinister faceplate obscured his features. His hands, resting on his abdomen, showed no signs of decay, looking like the flesh of a living person.\n\nWhen things are this abnormal, there's bound to be trouble.\n\nBefore Yan Feifan, standing to the side, could even register his shock, Lu Ding unleashed a slash, aiming to decapitate the male corpse.\n\nIn a flash, the mask covering the corpse's face squirmed, revealing demonic eyes and twisting into a grotesque smile.\n\nIt then twisted at a bizarre angle to dodge the attack, rolled to its feet, and its lips moved, but no sound came out.\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nLu Ding delivered a sweeping whip kick, sending the corpse flying backward until it was deeply embedded in the wall.\n\n\"Brother Lu, it looks like it wants to say something.\"\n\n\"Not listening!\"\n\nLu Ding's voice was frigid. He raised his hand and channeled his Qi, unleashing a torrent of ravaging slashes that swept through everything in the tomb chamber in an indiscriminate attack.\n\nHe didn't have the time to listen to nonsense from this thing—whether it was a ghost, a demon, a monster, or an evil spirit, it wasn't human anyway.\n\nIf it's not human, it has to die.\n\nInside the tomb chamber, the male corpse did its best to dodge the attacks, but its body was still covered in bloody wounds. Its armor fell away, revealing the raw, red flesh beneath.\n\nA foul stench emanated from the flesh, wafting through the chamber.\n\nLu Ding continued to launch slash after slash without pause.\n\nThe corpse's movements grew slower and slower as it dodged.\n\nJust then, Yan Feifan, who was standing behind him, finally found the relevant information on his phone in the Bureau 749 archives section.\n\n\"Brother Lu!! A Living Corpse!! This is a Living Molting Corpse!! It's being forced into its final molt right now! Quick, kill it! Don't let it finish!!!\"\n\nA Living Molting Corpse is similar to a *jiangshi*,² but they are of a different kind within the same family. Legend has it that in ancient times, many powerful figures were unwilling to accept the end of their lifespan.\n\nBefore their time was up, they would seek all sorts of methods to extend their lives, or even to achieve resurrection and immortality.\n\nThe Living Molting Corpse was one such method.\n\nThis method was derived from the tenets of a secret Vajrayana Buddhist practice: \"If one is looked down upon by others, it is due to the sins of their past life, for which they should have fallen into a wicked path. Because they are looked down upon in this life, the sins of their past life are thus eliminated, and they shall attain *Anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*³... This is the principle behind 'dropping the butcher's knife to become a Buddha on the spot.'\"\n\nThis was originally a principle for achieving enlightenment.\n\nLater generations twisted its meaning, using profane methods to pervert its path. It became a method suitable for those who had committed widespread slaughter.\n\nBefore their time was up, they would live-refine a Living Corpse, purging the poisons of slaughter, resentment, and sinful karma from their bodies. This negative karma would coalesce into armor. Shedding the armor was the molt—casting off the old self, casting off the sins of slaughter, all in the hope of being reborn as a new being.\n\nHowever, what ultimately emerged from this process was not a person, but a Living Corpse, a monster. It was no longer its former self; everything was cast off.\n\nAll that remained was a Living Corpse possessing immense power, acting on instinct, a savage creature that devoured flesh and blood.\n\nThe living molt is a rebirth. Even if the timing of the molt is wrong, as long as it can finish, it will emerge in a completely new and powerful form.\n\nBut during the living molt, the Living Corpse is extremely vulnerable.\n\nJust like a snake.\n\nPrompted by Yan Feifan's reminder, Lu Ding also recalled this information. He shot across the room, pressing in close to the Living Corpse. The spiritual Qi in his body surged as he went all out, and the phantom of a Flying Bear materialized behind him.\n\nAt this moment, he embodied a fraction of the Flying Bear's divine likeness, using sheer brute force to overpower and tackle the Living Corpse.\n\n\"A living molt is not as good as dismemberment. Let me help you with that!\"\n***\n¹ A reference to rules from the popular Chinese tomb-raiding novel series *Ghost Blows Out the Light*. \"Tomb Raider Captains\" (*Mojin Xiaowei*) are the protagonists, and their key rule is to light a candle in a tomb; if it's extinguished by a \"ghost,\" they must leave empty-handed.\n\n² *Jiangshi*: A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, often translated as a \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n\n³ *Anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*: A Sanskrit term for perfect, unexcelled enlightenment in Buddhism.",

    "content": "The tyrannical qualities\n\nHe slashed his fingers into claws, and the upper body was sturdy and swelled.\n\nWith the blood overflowing, no matter how the cell is slammed, the flying bear shadow behind the cauldron can not be forced to move.\n\nAllows you to leave your skin and flesh, and your muscles and bones will break\n\nYan Feifan, who witnessed everything, only felt that at this moment, the lunar calendar was even more dead than the occupants.\n\nIf so,\n\nThe Ding doesn't want to use this method either, it's too unelegant\n\nHowever, the way of fighting the car cannot kill the cell in seconds. He doesn't want to give this cell a chance to change it.\n\nSo I could only use the Bear Killing method, killing the gods and tearing it up\n\nGet up\n\nHalf-body clothes are contaminated with blood\n\nThe most harsh sounds heard in the brain\n\n【Containing Monsters: Live Electrical Activity】\n\n【Give the prize: Live and live】\n\n[Living and Living: Can recover from injury through the renal skin, state]\n\nLiving human skin, this skill is a bit erectile slight, but if you are in the middle, it’s easy to use. Just think about it. The enemy finally made the tripod a severe injury. As a result, his skin recovered from its peak and returned to the ground.\n\nThe enemy is expected to be in danger on the spot\n\nAlthough I have another full-level method\n\nBut the lunar calendar still feels that it is a bit of a bad idea\n\nHe's here to find Baoba\n\nBut if you swipe this tomb, you don’t have a single treasure except for the living sanctuary. This guy was also strange when he was alive. As his main tomb, he would not be buried with him at all.\n\nWorking in vain again\n\nHe wanted to find a treasure magic weapon that belonged to him, why was it so difficult?\n\n\"Brother Liu, don't be angry. Although we didn't find the baby this time, we killed the live-fire operator. The bureau will definitely reward us.\"\n\n\"I guess it won't give much, don't have too much hope.\"\n\nThis live-action has not been born and harmed people, it was they who came to the door by themselves\n\nSo at most, it is a task, so as to protect against unpredictable contribution points\n\nIf I could be captured alive, I would probably give a lot of them\n\nBut this is true that only a fool can buy and sell the money by letting the tripod take a full-level method to change the money. He is not stupid.\n\n\"It's OK, I'm not careful.\"\n\nYan Feifan is easy to satisfy\n\nHe looked at the situation in the tomb and his eyes turned: \"Brother Ru, I suddenly thought that an order can prevent you from being punished by the bureau. We can also get more contributions.\"\n\n\"What's the solution\"\n\n\"We can do this.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as the screen was turned, in the 749 investigation and inquiry room, this is the second time that the Ding has come here.\n\nIt was still those two staff members who had data in their hands\n\n\"So what you mean is that you wanted to see if the collapsed area is cleaned and there are still monsters, but just after you go in, you heard the smell of a live-fire cell. At this time, Ye Xuan jumped out and refused to let you in, and even asked you out of your way. After you took action, he couldn't beat you and threatened you, so you hit him in the name of hindering the business and threatening the lives of 749 patrol personnel.\"\n\n\"Later, Huang Zuo jumped out and wanted to take action against you for Ye Xuan. You killed him in the name of killing 749 patrolmen. Finally, with the help of investigator Yan Feifan, you entered the tomb, successfully killed the living organ, and tore it into pieces, solving a problem that is about to explode in the Baofan area.\"\n\n\"I want to correct it here. It's not that I heard the smell of the live-action cell, but that I heard the smell of the monster. I don't know what kind of monster it is, but that I practice the flying bear killing method, which can remove the flying bear's ideas and have the ability to track and recognize monsters, so I went to investigate first, and did not report the suspicious situation to the bureau in advance because I couldn't make it.\"\n\nThe expression of the lunar calendar is really said\n\nThis is what Yan Feifan came up with. Although it is almost the same, it adjusted the order and timeline of all things.\n\nIf you don't understand the situation, there will be no loopholes at all.\n\nMoreover, the degree of chance of discovering a monster by Bao is different from the level of awards that he predicts in advance and won before he can get it.\n\nThe staff looked at the Ding suspiciously\n\nHe was repairing the idea of flying bear thinking about this matter, and after investigation, it was confirmed that it was true.\n\nTherefore, the method of killing a bear with a fetus is also real\n\nBut there is a doubt here\n\n\"Please ask, whether you are facing Ye Xuan's obstacles, and tell him that you are investigating the monster.\"\n\n\"No, the 749th Bureau stipulates that the execution of the mission cannot be informed to outsiders in detail, and patrolling the traditional area of the treasure is my mission. I cannot tell him that this violates the regulations, and I will say that I don't want to tell him anything. Is it true that every outsider has the right to know our 749 investigator's action plan and trajectory?\"\n\nThe truth is indeed this truth\n\nBut you're too strict with the rules and regulations\n\nIt's really not wiped at all\n\nAt this moment, in the eyes of the two staff members, the image of the Ding has become a terrifying genius who strictly follows the rules and regulations, possesses iron and bloody methods, is cruel and ruthless, and is terrifying with monsters and monsters.\n\nAlthough this process is weird, the results are a bit uneven\n\nBut you can't find someone else's reason\n\nIt's actually difficult\n\nFinally, after a series of repeated confirmations\n\nShu Ding walked out of the consultation room safely\n\nI took 500,000 yuan in bonus points and 500,000 yuan in money\n\nIt's actually an unexpected fortune\n\nYan Feifan was waiting for a long time while driving, and the two returned to the prosperous area.\n\nAfter that time, I took a rest for two days\n\nNo other things happened in the middle\n\nAfter finally silenced, no one said he would ask the guests for a meal, and no one said he was revenge, as if time had stopped\n\nThe Sun Ding thought this was the calm before the wind and rain came.\n\nAfter all, he had a lot of things to do now. He killed Ye Xuan who came down from Dahei Mountain and snatched the fixed style beads of the Tianli Sect. One was a bandit and the other was a cult, and neither was a good master.\n\nAs a result, this place didn't even collapse for two days\n\nThat's not right\n\nUntil this day\n\nWen Yuquan posted a message that someone had given Fengzhu a bid, and there were still many\n\nA hundred-year-old ginseng doll has become a plate of genitals, plus a roaring chicken, and finally there are 30 million cash.\n\nIf it weren't for the Shuding watching the last 30 millionHe also thought the buyer had bought these things to make him feel good.\n\nIt's ginseng, shiitake, and angrily chicken, and it's gone up to the mountain market.\n\nHowever, although these things are a bit of earthy, they are all good things that can help repair the bracelet.\n\nGreat\n\nAnd if you pick out one by one, except for the 30 million, each of the first three values does not count for the style beads.\n\nShu Ding was also curious about who was so arrogant to take action.\n\nWen Yuquan only said three words to him, \"The treasurer is a treasure.\"\n\nThat's nothing, this group of people is famous for being rich and diamonds in the mountains all year round. Wherever there is good things, they will be there.\n\nWhen Lu Ding didn't join 749 in the early years, he heard the names of these people.\n\nIt was said that there were golden chickens and golden dolls hidden in the stone. In the end, they were all taken away by the treasurer.\n\nJust because he is famous to this level, ordinary people know that to be rich, except for those who are the most powerful people in the eighth century, these people say second, no one dares to say first.\n\nTo be more specific, the difference between a treasurer and a tomb is not big\n\nThe only difference is that the treasure is very capable. The tomb only does the tomb, and the tomb dares to fuck anything, the tomb of Baji and the outlaws.\n\nThe Ding vaguely remembered that I heard from the old man of Qianjin that the Tianli Sect raised the centipede this time to get the fixed wind beads and cooperate with the treasurer to catch the Zhima in the top wind mountain.\n\nNow the treasurer comes to him again to buy a fixed style bead\n\nIt's hard to have something to do with the Tianli Sect\n\nWith doubts in his heart, he went to the place where he was talking.",

    "content": "...\n\nCloud Dream Grand Hotel.\n\nIt had existed for several hundred years. If a star-rated hotel was high-end, atmospheric, and top-grade, then this place was understated luxury with a deep character.\n\nInside a private room.\n\nTwo young men, one with a wild temperament and rugged looks, were puffing away in a cloud of smoke, waiting for the man of the hour to arrive.\n\n\"Bro, we haven't even finished our own work. Is it really necessary to snatch food from the mouths of Lame Li and the Heavenly Principle Cult?\"\n\nThe youth next to him tore into the roast chicken on the plate in front of them, stuffed a drumstick into his own mouth, and then passed another to his little brother.\n\nHe made a motion as if to say \"ah\" with his mouth open.\n\nThe little brother opened his mouth, and the youth shoved the chicken, meat and bone alike, into his mouth.\n\nSeeing his little brother's pathetic state, the youth's expression was defiant. \"Isn't everything in this world just there for the taking? We walk through the mountains day in and day out, treading on the blades of knives. How have you still not figured it out? In this world, whoever has the skill, whoever has the brains, gets the treasure.\"\n\n\"Remember this one thing from your big bro: a dog that doesn't eat won't get fat, and a man who isn't greedy won't get strong.\"\n\n\"Back then, my mom died early. Weren't all the things that should have been my family's snatched away by that mutt Cao Yuan? I understood it from that moment on. I, Cao Ying, would rather die from greed than starve to death. That's why I gave up the comfortable life in Cao Family Alley to go into the mountains to hunt for treasure.\"\n\n\"Now I, Cao Ying, have returned. After knocking about for these few years, I've done quite well for myself. It's about time I prepared a handsome gift for my old man, don't you think? I think that Ginseng Man and Lingzhi Horse look pretty good, just the right thing to present.\"\n\n\"Besides, this Patrol Officer Lu... I've heard so much about him my ears have grown calluses, but I've never even met him. Another friend is another path, another wife is another home. No matter how you slice it, this deal is worth it.\"\n\nThe little brother nodded in confusion. He didn't quite get it, but whatever his brother said, went.\n\nHis brother had dug him out of a grave pile. Who was he going to listen to if not his brother?\n\nThree knocks sounded on the door of the private room.\n\nWen Yuquan pushed the door open and entered, with Lu Ding half a step behind him.\n\nHe happened to be free today, so he came along with Lu Ding. Besides, as the middleman, they were all friends; there was no reason for him not to show up.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, Old Wen, long time no see! The last time we saw each other was... the last time we saw each other! You've gotten fatter, hahaha.\"\n\nCao Ying opened his arms for a hug. Wen Yuquan's face was as black as ink, but he didn't dodge, letting Cao Ying embrace him.\n\nLu Ding was also sizing up Cao Ying at that moment.\n\nShort hair, a broken eyebrow, wearing a suit jacket with no shirt underneath, a piece of jade hanging from his neck. It was a style of dress that should have been the epitome of tacky, but that face somehow managed to give it a unique, roguish air.\n\nIt was a different feeling from Ye Xuan.\n\nCao Ying gave off more of a sense of ruthlessness, whereas Ye Xuan was more of a roguish hooligan.\n\nWhile he was sizing up Cao Ying, Cao Ying was also sizing him up.\n\nThe two were actually quite similar.\n\nTheir sharp edges were unconcealed, but unlike Cao Ying's ruthless aura, Lu Ding's was more of a brutal and completely undisguised wantonness.\n\nThis point made Cao Ying's evaluation of Lu Ding rise a few notches.\n\nHe despised dealing with people who played mind games at such a young age.\n\nIt wasn't that he couldn't outplay them. He had, after all, fought his way through mountains of knives and seas of fire, through treacherous and unpredictable situations. When it came to schemes, he, Cao Ying, had plenty.\n\nWhile others had eyes growing on their hearts, he had a heart growing on his eyes.¹\n\n\"Patrol Officer Lu, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. I've long admired your name. Let's get straight to the point. Talk first, eat later, how about it!?\"\n\nThe way this person spoke and acted suited Lu Ding's tastes.\n\n\"Then let's talk first.\"\n\nThe three of them sat down.\n\nWen Yuquan didn't speak, just watched quietly from the side.\n\nCao Ying directly lifted the bundle from the floor and tossed it onto the table.\n\n\"Patrol Officer Lu, the goods are all inside. Please, take a look. If they're to your satisfaction, thirty million can be in your account immediately.\"\n\nLu Ding took the bundle.\n\nThe Ginseng Doll lay quietly inside, already air-dried. It had a nose and eyes, just like a living person, only a different size. The Lingzhi fungus was placed to the side, emitting a fragrant scent.\n\nThe Furious Sun Rooster was bound, its eyes sharp and full of spirit, its vitality at its peak.\n\nWhether in appearance or medicinal power, they were all of the highest quality.\n\nLu Ding closed the bundle. \"The goods are good, and I trust the person Wen Yuquan introduced. But I still have to give you a warning: I snatched this from the hands of the Heavenly Principle Cult. They don't have the ability to snatch it back from me, but once it's in your hands, whether it's a blessing or a curse, I can't say. There's no after-sales service from my end.\"\n\n\"You don't need to worry about that, Patrol Officer Lu. I wonder if you've ever heard this saying: there are four you don't provoke in the world of Qi Refiners. The officials from 749, the people who run in the mountains, the ghosts that walk in the day, and the corpses that fly in the sky. You're number one, and I'm number two. If they can't afford to provoke you, they might not necessarily be able to afford to provoke me.\"\n\nSo said Cao Ying.\n\nThe \"officials from 749\" referred to the investigators of Bureau 749. Provoke one, and a whole bunch will come. Kill one, and a whole group will follow.\n\nAs for \"the people who run in the mountains,\" they were the Treasure Hunters. These people roamed deep mountains and old forests, perilous and remote places. Any one of them with a bit of a name was piled high with treasures and had countless trump cards. They were all fierce and vicious; without these things, they would never have made a name for themselves.\n\nAs for their abilities, that went without saying.\n\nThe last two, \"the ghosts that walk in the day\" and \"the corpses that fly in the sky.\"\n\nThose were no ordinary things.\n\nNever mind provoking them; just seeing one and living to tell the tale was enough to brag about for a lifetime.\n\nThe reason they were ranked in this list was mainly to highlight the power and ferocity of the first two.\n\nThere were also rumors that the first two were specialists in dealing with the latter two, a case of specific remedies for specific ailments.\n\nSince the man wasn't afraid, the rest was simple. They ate, drank, and chatted, getting to know each other and exchanging contact information. Lu Ding also made a mental note of this person, Cao Ying. Finally, they dispersed, each going their separate ways, back to their own homes to find their own mothers.\n\nIt was quite a pleasant affair.\n\nWalking along the road at night, feeling the cool breeze, with a huge sum of money in his pocket.\n\nLu Ding didn't feel as excited as he had imagined.\n\nHe didn't know if it was because the money was too little, or if his psychological threshold had been raised.\n\nOr perhaps, the things he pursued were different now, having changed from money and fame to cultivation and power.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Wen Yuquan asked, handing him a cigarette.\n\nLu Ding took it. \"Tell me, what realm does one's cultivation and power have to reach to be considered high?\"\n\nWen Yuquan immediately snuffed out the cigarette he had just lit and walked towards his parking spot without looking back.\n\n\"That's so damn pretentious. I can't even talk to you. I'm going back to cultivate!\"\n\nHe was truly hit hard.\n\nIn terms of cultivation time, he surpassed Lu Ding by a factor of ten, at least. But in terms of combat power, Lu Ding could beat him tenfold with his hands behind his back.\n\nHe too was called a genius by others.\n\nHow was it that here, he was like one of the grunt heavenly soldiers standing behind the Four Heavenly Kings when Sun Wukong wreaked havoc in heaven?²\n\nEvery one of them was a peerless genius who could ascend after a thousand years of cultivation, yet they were swept away in swathes by Sun Wukong, beaten down in a line by his staff.\n\nGame over without even a proper on-screen appearance.\n\nCao Ying was badass because he had fought his way through life and death; he deserved to be badass. Lu Ding's badassery was incomprehensibly badass. No one knew why he was badass, just that he was.\n\nPoor Wen Yuquan was crushed.\n\nLu Ding shouted to Wen Yuquan as he drove past, \"I'll treat you to a meal next time.\"\n\n\"You'd better mean it. I'm off. Be safe on your way back, don't get robbed.\"\n\nLu Ding laughed out loud at that.\n\nRob him?\n\nThey'd have to pay with their lives.\n\nDriving the security vehicle he had borrowed from the Public Security Administration Bureau, the journey back was unimpeded.\n\nYan Feifan was still cultivating. He had probably realized that his insufficient cultivation might become a drag on Lu Ding. From the day he came out of the interrogation room, the kid hadn't stopped.\n\nLu Ding borrowed a large wok from the Public Security Administration Bureau's kitchen, boiled water, killed the chicken, plucked its feathers, chopped it into pieces, and threw it into the pot to stew along with the Ginseng Doll and the sentient Lingzhi.\n\nOnly two words for it: incredibly fragrant.\n\nIt bubbled away from morning till night. When he lifted the lid, the aroma rushed to his face. He took a spoon to taste for saltiness—the flavor was absolutely divine!\n\nWith one mouthful, a stream of pure spiritual Qi instantly filled the Empty Aperture Qi Vortex inside Lu Ding's body.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

    "content": "...\n\nHe got a basin and portioned some out for Yan Feifan.\n\nAs for the rest, Lu Ding waited for it to cool completely. In the meantime, he meditated to regulate his state. Once the temperature was about right, he rolled up his sleeves and picked up his bowl. His chopsticks were a whirlwind, his mouth a shovel, and he began stuffing it in with big mouthfuls.\n\nIn that instant, the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth erupted violently, gathering into the eye of a storm in the sky above. As the medicinal effects spread through Lu Ding's body, a spiritual Qi storm, like a tornado, drilled straight into him.\n\nWith the medicinal effects of the Ginseng Doll, the old Lingzhi mushroom, and the Wrathful Sun Rooster protecting his meridians, Lu Ding wasn't the least bit afraid of sustaining damage again.\n\nActivating his Oneness with Heaven and Earth skill, he went full throttle, absorbing as much as he possibly could, swallowing it directly into his body.\n\nOne by one, the Empty Aperture vortexes were rapidly filled.\n\nIn less than half an hour, Lu Ding's realm broke through from the Zhaoxuan Sixth Level to the Zhaoxuan Seventh Level.\n\nThen came the Zhaoxuan Eighth Level.\n\nAnd the Zhaoxuan Ninth Level.\n\nUntil the very last Empty Aperture vortex was filled.\n\nAll the vortexes began to spin in unison in a single direction.\n\nA surging heat appeared from nowhere, rising from the Yongquan point, passing through Taixi, over Yangling, through Xuehai, and finally gathering in his Lower Dantian.\n\nHe then felt a cool sensation drift down from the fontanelle at the crown of his head, entering the Shenting point, circling the Niwan Palace, and traveling straight down to the Lower Dantian, where yin and yang converged.\n\nWith a crisp *crack*, a sliver of light pierced through the dimness of his Lower Dantian. Heaven and earth began to separate.\n\nThis was the third realm of cultivation: the Spiritual Sea.\n\nLu Ding's cultivation speed was already incredibly fast while in the state of Oneness with Heaven and Earth. Aided by potent medicines like the Ginseng Doll, it wasn't surprising that he had charged into the Spiritual Sea realm in one go.\n\nMoreover, upon reaching this realm, true cultivation had only just begun.\n\nIf talent is the first watershed for a Qi Cultivator, then the Spiritual Sea is the second.\n\nThe larger and more solid the Spiritual Sea, the more spiritual Qi it can store, the higher its quality, and the better one's foundation will be. The opposite is also true.\n\nIn the Spiritual Sea realm, talent, resources, and time are all indispensable.\n\nTalent determines the upper limit of the Spiritual Sea's size, while resources determine its lower limit—that is, its solidity and the quality of the spiritual Qi.\n\nA newly opened Spiritual Sea is like a small, dried-up puddle. The Qi Cultivator must liquefy the spiritual Qi from their internal vortexes and gather it within the Spiritual Sea. Subsequently, they must continuously use heavenly materials and earthly treasures to help expand and reinforce the Spiritual Sea.\n\nOf course, one could also do without them and rely solely on talent, but a Spiritual Sea cultivated this way will only be inferior to others'.\n\nIt's like building a house.\n\nSome people use bricks that cost three mao¹ a piece, while others use ones that cost three yuan a piece. Some will choose to install floor heating and soundproofing, while others feel that as long as it's built, it's ready to use.\n\nIn reality, only you know its true usability, comfort, and lifespan.\n\nLu Ding's talent was beyond question.\n\nWhat he lacked were resources—all sorts of heavenly materials and earthly treasures with miraculous effects.\n\nBesides finding these things through his own fortunate encounters, the main way to obtain them was by exchanging for them at the 749.\n\nLu Ding actually had another plan.\n\nHadn't he just met Cao Ying, a Biebaoren²? He wanted to see if he could get some good stuff from him to properly build up his Spiritual Sea.\n\nAfter all, the man was generous and clearly came from a wealthy background.\n\nLu Ding wouldn't miss out on the heavenly materials and earthly treasures from the 749 either, but he had too few contribution points at the moment—all told, he had less than a hundred. It wasn't enough to exchange for anything significant. He had to figure something out.\n\nBut that was all for later.\n\nWhat he needed to do now was liquefy his Qi to fill his Spiritual Sea. Before that, however, he had to deliver the portioned-out chicken soup to Yan Feifan.\n\nWhether it was killing the Flying Centipede in White Kiln Ancient Town or tearing apart the Living Molt Corpse in the Collapse Zone, Yan Feifan had been with him. The guy had even helped strategize; Lu Ding wasn't one to hog the spoils.\n\nYan Feifan, holding the chicken soup, was deeply moved, saying he would definitely cultivate hard and break through to the Aperture Opening realm in one go.\n\nAfter offering a few words of encouragement, Lu Ding returned to his room and began liquefying his Qi.\n\nTime passed, minute by minute. The sun rose and set. Night fell.\n\nA white SUV with a buckled hood crashed into the Baofan District Public Security Bureau, hitting several safely parked cars before stopping.\n\nA woman's figure stumbled out of the vehicle. Her expression was terrified, her face deathly pale. She ran toward the Public Security Bureau building, screaming at the top of her lungs, \"Help!!!! Help!!!!\"\n\nThe guard from the sentry post behind ran up and restrained her.\n\nThe woman, unfazed, continued to scream for help.\n\nSoon, a group of public security officers rushed out at the sound. Even Gao Zhengliang was drawn out by the commotion.\n\nHe quickly instructed his subordinates to take the woman to an interview room and called for a doctor to give her a sedative. Only then did the woman's emotions stabilize.\n\nClutching a cup of warm water, a blanket draped over her shoulders, the woman looked at the officers in the room and said with a tremor in her voice, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do this, I'm sorry. I'm just so scared. They... they all say I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy.\"\n\n\"I saw it. I saw everything. My child, my husband, my father-in-law, and my mother-in-law... they're not human. They're not human, *sob sob sob*...\"\n\nThe officers all looked at one another, their gazes finally settling on Gao Zhengliang.\n\nBefore he could speak, Lu Ding walked in from the doorway and asked, \"What's going on?\"\n\nHis room faced the courtyard to catch the sun. The sound of the crash just now had been too loud, disturbing Lu Ding, who had been in the middle of liquefying Qi to fill his Spiritual Sea.\n\nHe got up and looked out the window, only to see the official SUV borrowed from Bureau 749 knocked sideways in its parking spot.\n\nIt wasn't anything major, but the paint was definitely chipped.\n\nUnaware of the full situation, Lu Ding was a little pissed off and immediately went downstairs to investigate, only to find out that a woman seeking help had accidentally hit his car. The person was now in the interview room, and Chief Gao and the others were with her.\n\nAnd so, Lu Ding went over.\n\nSeeing him arrive, the people at the door quickly made way.\n\nGao Zhengliang, who had been sitting, also stood up and briefly recounted what the woman had just said.\n\nThis time, it was Lu Ding who took a seat.\n\nHe asked, \"So, what happened? Can you tell me about it?\"\n\nAlthough the terrified woman was in no state to appreciate Lu Ding's handsome appearance, seeing a good-looking person take over still helped soothe her emotions a bit.\n\n\"Our... our wardrobe eats people. No, no, no, it doesn't eat people, it replaces them. Everyone in my family has been replaced. No one believes me, no one believes what I'm saying... You don't think I'm mentally ill, do you? I'm not mentally ill, it's true, it's really true. The Public Security office in Linhua didn't believe me; they even called my husband to take me back.\"\n\n\"They're going to eat me, they're really going to eat me. Please, I'm begging you, believe me.\"\n\nLu Ding's tone was gentle. \"Don't worry, I believe you. So, can you tell me what happened?\"\n\nThe unease in the woman's eyes faded slightly. \"Okay, I'll talk. I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"My husband and I have been married for ten years. A while ago, my husband went on a business trip. After our son's summer vacation started, he said he missed his grandma, so I sent him to her house. They weren't home.\"\n\n\"I was home alone. That night, while I was sleeping, I vaguely saw what looked like a pair of eyes on the wardrobe. But the room was too dark, and I wondered if I was mistaken. I didn't dare go up to check. I was scared. It's always like that on TV.\"\n\n\"Someone notices something's wrong with a place, they go over to look, and they end up getting startled or snatched by something that suddenly jumps out.\"\n\n\"So I called my husband. I told him we should replace the wardrobe at home, that I saw eyes on it. That wardrobe... we bought it later because our old one was too small to fit our clothes.\"\n\n\"My husband agreed, saying he'd replace it when he got back from his trip. He even comforted me, saying there's no such thing as a wardrobe with eyes. We were on a video call, and he told me to put my phone on a selfie stick and extend it over so he could look for me. I did as he said.\"\n\n\"My husband said there were no eyes. He also said that if I was really scared, he'd just replace the wardrobe when he got back.\"\n\n\"A few days later, my husband came back. It was too late that night, and neither of us remembered about replacing the wardrobe. Later, when I was sleeping, I groggily saw the wardrobe door open. A pair of long, slender hands reached out from inside.\"\n\n\"Then a bald man in a black shirt leaned out, his upper body emerging, and just like that, he dragged my husband from the bed into the wardrobe. He was gone in an instant.\"\n\n\"The next moment, I snapped awake and realized it was already daytime. I thought I'd had a nightmare. I heard my husband's voice outside the door calling me for breakfast, so I didn't think much of it. Later, when I brought up replacing the wardrobe again, my husband got angry, smashed his bowl on the spot, and said we'd grown attached to it, so why replace it.\"\n\n***\n\n¹ **Mao (毛):** A unit of Chinese currency. 10 mao equal 1 yuan.

    "content": ".......\n\nAs she said this, the woman's tears flowed uncontrollably, her eyes filled with fear.\n\nShe continued speaking.\n\n\"My husband is very good to me. Although it's normal for couples to bicker, and we've argued before, he's never fought with me over something like that. We had a huge fight that day, and my husband left for work, leaving me at home to clean up.\"\n\n\"I was crying while I tidied up. Later, I called my son. He could tell I was crying and asked me what happened. I didn't tell him about the fight, just said it was nothing. Then, as we chatted, the conversation turned to the wardrobe at home.\"\n\n\"My son said that Grandma's wardrobe was so big and could hold lots of clothes, while our wardrobe was so small, and he didn't like it. He asked me to replace it.\"\n\n\"I just casually said, 'Your dad won't agree.'\"\n\n\"Then my son said that he got second in his class on his final exams this time, so his dad would definitely agree.\"\n\n\"After we hung up, I felt a bit better. When my husband came home that night, he suddenly told me that he missed our son and wanted me to bring him back home.\"\n\n\"I didn't think much of it and brought our son back. Later, I don't know when it started, but I felt my son had changed. He became quiet and withdrawn, and started to act aggressively toward other children.\"\n\nWhen she reached this point, Lu Ding interjected for the first time. \"So how did you discover that your husband and son had been replaced? And what about your in-laws? Weren't they not at your house? How were they replaced?\"\n\nAs for the son, Lu Ding could more or less piece it together. The boy had probably told his father about the conversation after hanging up with his mother.\n\nThen, the father, who had already been replaced, took issue with the child broaching the taboo topic of replacing the wardrobe. So the monster had the woman bring the child back, and then replaced the child.\n\nBut what about the others?\n\nHow were the others involved?\n\nThe woman looked up, the color completely drained from her lips, leaving them a deathly white.\n\n\"I remember it very clearly. It was a Thursday. My son bit another child while playing in the community, and it was a very bad bite. The property management notified my husband and me. I got there first. The first thing I did was apologize to the other child's parents. Then I asked my son why he bit the other kid.\"\n\n\"He... he said the other kid smelled so good, he couldn't help but take a bite. At that point, I already knew something was wrong, but I hadn't figured out the crucial part yet.\"\n\n\"On the way home, my son acted very afraid of my husband. I even joked with my husband, asking if he had been scaring our son. My husband said no. Then he suddenly changed the subject and said he missed his parents, and that our son missed his grandpa and grandma too. He asked me to call them and have them come stay for a while.\"\n\n\"I thought that was a good idea. I was so mentally exhausted around that time, and having my parents help with the kid would let me rest. The next day, I had my parents come over.\"\n\n\"My husband was at work, my parents were watching the child, so I could finally get some rest. It was on that day. I woke up from a nap in the afternoon and found that my child, my husband, and my parents were all gone. I called and sent messages, but no one replied.\"\n\n\"I was getting worried, so I opened the parental control app on my phone that manages my son's smart watch.\"\n\n\"The app lets you see his tracks and location, and you can also discreetly activate a live audio feature. I bought it a long time ago because I was scared my son would be abducted by traffickers.\"\n\n\"When I opened it, I saw that my son's location was right there in the house. But I had already searched the house and knew no one was there. So I activated the watch's live audio feature. Before I could say anything, I heard my son's voice come from the other end.\"\n\nThe woman swallowed hard. \"He... he said Grandpa and Grandma's meat was too tough and didn't taste good.\"\n\n\"Then my husband said, 'You can't just eat people. If you can't control your mouth again, I'll stuff you back inside.'\"\n\n\"When I heard that, I instinctively thought of our wardrobe. I rushed over and threw it open, but there was nothing inside. All the chaotic thoughts in my mind suddenly connected. My husband and my son... they didn't seem to be human anymore.\"\n\n\"I was terrified. I ran to the Linhua Street Public Security Office and explained the situation. I could tell they didn't believe me, but they still came back to my house with me. The moment they opened the door, I saw my parents and my son watching TV at home.\"\n\n\"I couldn't believe it. I didn't understand. My parents had clearly been eaten, so why were they here, alive and well? The public security officer said I was under too much stress. My husband also said I was under too much stress and told me to quit my job. But when I turned my head, I could see my parents staring at me sinisterly.\"\n\n\"The way they looked at me, it was like they wanted to eat me alive!!!\"\n\n\"They locked me in the house and wouldn't let me go anywhere. They even had a doctor prescribe me medication. Then one day, they were gone again. I knew, I knew it!!! They must have gone out to eat people again!!! I knew that's what it was, so I broke free from the ropes and ran.\"\n\n\"Look, look, these are ligature marks, marks from the rope! I'm not lying! They can't be my family! Save my son, save my husband, I'm begging you, I'm begging you! No one believes me, please, believe me! There really are monsters in this world, there really are!!!!\"\n\nThe woman agitatedly raised her wrists to show everyone the ligature marks.\n\nAt that moment, the room fell silent.\n\nOf course, they knew there were monsters in the world, but they couldn't admit it.\n\nLu Ding now understood the full details of the matter.\n\nHe took out his credentials and said in a soft, reassuring voice, \"Ma'am, don't be afraid, and don't be nervous. I'm with State Security. You've heard of State Security, right?\"\n\nThe woman snatched the credentials, flipping through them carefully, looking at the official seal and the ID photo that matched the young man's face in front of her.\n\nShe nodded, the light of hope about to burst from her eyes. \"I know, I know State Security, I know.\"\n\n\"Good, as long as you know. Now, you wait here patiently. I'm going to your home to survey the situation myself. That wardrobe you mentioned—I don't care if it's a real monster or a fake one, I'm going to smash it to pieces. I hope you won't ask me for compensation, is that okay?\"\n\nThe woman nodded rapidly. \"I won't, I won't. I won't ask for compensation.\"\n\nShe didn't want Lu Ding to so easily agree with her that monsters existed. Even though it was her personal experience, she had never actually seen her son and husband transform into real monsters, and her upbringing had always taught her that monsters weren't real.\n\nYet she also didn't want Lu Ding to deny her claim, because aside from monsters, she had no other explanation for the situation, and she was convinced she wasn't crazy.\n\nSo when Lu Ding said he would smash the wardrobe, the woman couldn't help but bow her head and sob, unable to speak another word.\n\nSignaling for the female public security officer beside them to take care of the woman, Lu Ding walked out of the room, with Gao Zhenliang following behind him.\n\n\"Director Gao, please keep a close eye on the informant's emotional state. I need to make a trip to the Dinghao Community. If anything comes up, go get Yan Feifan.\"",

    "content": "Due to the potential danger of this situation, and considering Yan Feifan's limited hard strength, Lu Ding did not plan to take him along.\n\nA monster that possesses normal human thinking, can undetectably replace identities, and has been active among humans for so long, is certainly not to be trifled with.\n\nTherefore, it was better to go alone. Even if the worst-case scenario occurred, and Lu Ding couldn't defeat the monster in the informant's home, he was confident he could escape.\n\nBut if he brought Yan Feifan, that might not be the case.\n\n“Don't worry, Patrol Officer Lu. Go in peace, I'll keep watch here. You also need to be careful.”\n\nAt this time, it was dark outside, and visibility was low.\n\nAfter Lu Ding said ‘Good,’ he flipped out of the window and flew into the air, deploying his Wind-Fixing Spell to its utmost.\n\nWhy drive when you can use cheats*?\nGao Zhengliang was so shocked that he unconsciously opened his mouth.\n\nAt this moment, all mythological stories and folk legends gained concrete form.\n\nIn Gao Zhengliang's mind, the faces of all the male protagonists from those stories completely merged with Lu Ding's appearance.\n\nSo Qi Cultivators can fly?\n\nAbove Baofan District, Lu Ding sped past, anger burning in his eyes.\n\nHe wanted to see exactly what kind of thing dared to cause trouble in his jurisdiction!!!\n\nAnd it even pulled off a ‘Civet Cat for Crown Prince’**, openly going to work?\n\nDid it really think Lu Ding was a pushover!!!\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side.\n\nDownstairs at Dinghao Residential Area.\n\nDong Xinrui had just finished moving. She led her large Golden Retriever, which had been cooped up all day, downstairs to relieve itself and get acquainted with the neighborhood.\n\nBut just as she went downstairs, she encountered a group of elderly men and women playing with their children.\n\nChildren are naturally playful, and Golden Retrievers are excessively fond of people. Now that the two met, it was like a turtle spotting a mung bean***, they instantly clicked.\n\nDong Xinrui couldn't hold it back; her large Golden Retriever simply wanted to play with the children.\n\nFortunately, she had put a muzzle on her dog before leaving, so she wasn't afraid of it hurting the children. The elderly men and women nearby also said to let it play with the kids.\n\nDong Xinrui didn't think too much of it; she lengthened the leash, allowing the dog to play with the children, while she herself chatted animatedly with the elderly men and women.\n\nEating melon seeds, listening to gossip.\n\nOccasionally letting out a gasp of surprise.\n\nLater, the elderly men and women started talking about their lives, saying who else had passed away.\n\nDong Xinrui, whose maternal grandfather had passed away last year, also chimed in.\n\n“Alas, my maternal grandfather was an old Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor. He told me that birth, aging, illness, and death are things everyone must face, and it's best to take them in stride. I used to think I was very open-minded, but when it truly happened to me, I didn't get over it for half a year.”\n\n“Especially when my maternal grandfather called me to his bedside before he passed away. He asked me to feel his pulse, and with a calm expression, he told me, ‘This is a dying pulse.’ As soon as he finished speaking those words, my maternal grandfather also breathed his last…”\n\nThe elderly men and women nearby listened, praising her as a filial and good girl.\n\nAfterward, somehow the conversation turned to Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\nOne elderly person was the first to speak, saying their appetite hadn't been good recently and asked Dong Xinrui to take their pulse.\n\nShe, too, was eager to try, saying her skills weren't perfected, she could take a pulse but couldn't prescribe medicine, and that it was just for fun, not to be taken seriously.\n\nThe elderly person said it was fine.\n\nAnd extended their hand for her to feel.\n\nWhere there was one, there was a second, then a third.\n\nMost of the elderly people were in relatively good health, at most having some age-related ailments.\n\nA small number of elderly people weren't in great health, but it wasn't anything serious.\n\nUntil, one elderly woman dragged over her husband.\n\n“Young lady, can you feel my husband's pulse for Grandma? He used to be quite talkative, but now he can't even fart for half the day, and his appetite isn't great either.”\n\nDong Xinrui placed her hand on his.\n\nHmm? That's not right! Why isn't it beating?\n\nCould it be that her skills weren't perfected?\n\n“Grandpa, could you give me that hand again?”\n\nAt first, Dong Xinrui had only used one hand to take pulses. She had some confidence in her skills, but now there was one without a pulse.\n\nDong Xinrui instantly felt a rush of anxiety.\n\nTo be safe, she used both hands.\n\nA squeeze!\n\nStill no beat!!!\n\nOh my god, she'd encountered something spooky! A living person without a pulse, this couldn't be a joke!!\n\nYet, she couldn't bring herself to say it.\n\nHow could she say it?\n\nGrandma, let me tell you something funny. Your old man here, his pulse isn't beating, but he can jump. Isn't that strange?\n\nFabricating an excuse about having a lot of things to tidy up at home, Dong Xinrui grabbed her dog and left.\n\nBack home, the more she thought about it, the less she could understand.\n\nHow could a living person, whom she'd seen with her own eyes, not have a pulse?\n\nShe sent messages to her best friend to ask.\n\nHer friend, however, told her bluntly: “That's simple! If a person's pulse isn't beating, they're either a zombie or a ghost. You, my dear, have hit the jackpot! This is a rare occurrence. Quickly, get out your phone and record a video, I guarantee you'll go viral.”\n\nThe speaker may have spoken casually, but the listener took it to heart.\n\nIt was at this very moment.\n\nThe doorbell rang.\n\nAlready like a frightened bird, Dong Xinrui jumped directly off the sofa in fright.\n\n“Who is it!!!!!”\n\nNo one answered.\n\nThe doorbell stopped ringing, but the next second, knocking sounded again.\n\nThump, thump, thump...\n\nDong Xinrui's voice unconsciously rose: “Who is it!!!!”\n\nStill, no one spoke.\n\nShe could only bravely tiptoe towards the door. Upon reaching it, the thing outside seemed to sense her presence behind the door and stopped knocking.\n\nAt this moment, Dong Xinrui's heart was practically leaping into her throat.\n\nShe slowly leaned onto the peephole.\n\nIt was a hazy blur, showing nothing.\n\nShe let out a long sigh of relief.\n\n“Scaring myself, scaring myself. It must have been a wrong knock.”\n\nDong Xinrui patted her chest, comforting herself this way.\n\nBut at this moment, the flash of inspiration that should least appear suddenly did.\n\nShe muttered to herself.\n\n“But I clearly heard knocking, it shouldn't be a hallucination. Yet, if there really was knocking, why didn't the sound-activated light outside turn on?”\n\nTo confirm, she leaned onto the peephole again.\n\nThis time, that hazy blur had two white dots.\n\nDong Xinrui's pupils instantly constricted.\n\nWhite dots!!!!!\n\nThe old person from before also had white dots in their eyes!!!\n\nIt was that old person from just now!\n\nIt turned out the sound-activated light hadn't failed; rather, the old person had also pressed their eye against the peephole, blocking the light.\n\n“I see you!!!!!”\n\nBang!!!\n\nThe old person's voice, interwoven with a huge crashing sound, came through.\n\nThe sturdy anti-theft door instantly bulged outwards with a huge protrusion.\n\nIt was clear how strong the thing outside was.\n\nAt this moment, Dong Xinrui also understood: it wasn't human, absolutely not human; what was outside the door could not possibly be human!!\n\nTerrified, she fell to the ground, covering her mouth, afraid to make a sound.\n\nShe could only scramble to her feet and run towards the back, wanting to grab her phone to call the police.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nA huge gash was torn in the anti-theft door. The old person, expressionless, squeezed into the room through the opening, allowing the sharp, broken edges of the anti-theft door to scrape and tear at his flesh.\n\nHe was still mumbling: “I see you!!!”\n\nA feeling of despair spread through Dong Xinrui's heart.\n\nIn her twenty-plus years of life, when had she ever experienced such a thing?\n\nThe next second, the same sentence echoed from the French window behind her.\n\n---\n*   *Cheats*: In this context, it refers to using supernatural abilities or extraordinary powers, similar to using cheats in a video game to gain an unfair advantage.\n**   *Civet Cat for Crown Prince*: A Chinese idiom referring to a fraudulent substitution, especially of a person's identity.\n*** *It was like a turtle spotting a mung bean*: A Chinese idiom describing two people or things that are a perfect match or instantly hit it off, often implying a quirky or unexpected connection.",

    "content": ".....\n\nOutside the floor-to-ceiling window was the 21st floor.\n\nDong Wenrui's body was stiff, her face pale, her mind blank. She slowly turned her head to look.\n\nAnd there, high in the air outside the window, a man was floating towards her, arms crossed.\n\nThe large floor-to-ceiling window in front of him silently shattered into hundreds of pieces, falling and scattering.\n\nA light breeze brushed across her face, and the image in her eyes flickered.\n\nLu Ding appeared before the old man as if he had teleported, his feet not touching the ground.\n\nHe raised his hand, cupping it to clasp the old man's forehead, and circulated the spiritual qi in his body, sending it surging in to investigate.\n\nAlthough the exterior was still a human shell, the inside had been replaced. Simply put, this was just a monster wearing human skin.\n\nHiding beneath was an ancient ghost.\n\nHis hand gradually tightened. The old man's expression twisted in pain.\n\nLu Ding spoke, his voice flat, devoid of any emotional fluctuation. \"Where is the original old man?\"\n\n\"Heh heh heh... Ate... ate him. Too old, a bit tough to chew.\"\n\nLu Ding raised a hand and slapped all his teeth out. \"Could it be that your teeth are just bad?\"\n\nHe applied force with his hand.\n\nThe old man's head burst open like a watermelon, its contents—black chunks of tissue accompanied by green ichor—splattering all over the floor.\n\nLu Ding shook the filth from his hand.\n\nA notification flickered on the Golden Finger panel, but no sound was heard.\n\n【Acquired Colorless Small Crystal Fragment*1】\n\n【Colorless Small Crystal Fragment: Formed from the convergence of pure heaven and earth spiritual qi, it contains pure soul power. Can be used to replenish consumption, and to enhance one's realm and combat power.】\n\nIt seemed this thing's level was too low to be worthy of containment.\n\nTherefore, it didn't reward a technique, only this kind of Colorless Small Crystal Fragment.\n\nLu Ding wasn't greedy; as long as there was something to gain, it was fine. The main prize he had come for this time wasn't these small fry.\n\nHe turned to look at Dong Wenrui, who was already dumbstruck.\n\nEarlier, while flying over, Lu Ding had seen her panicking in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, which was why he had flown over to stop and save her life.\n\n\"What floor is this?\"\n\nMost of the fear in Dong Wenrui's heart dissipated, and with some lingering fright, she answered Lu Ding's question, \"This is the 21st floor, 2109.\"\n\nAlthough she didn't know who this man was, she understood one thing: the person before her had saved her life.\n\nIf it weren't for Lu Ding, she might have already died at the hands of that monster, whatever it was.\n\nSo there really are ghosts in this world...\n\n\"I'm going elsewhere now. For the time being, stay home and hide well. Don't go anywhere.\"\n\nDong Wenrui nodded frantically. She didn't even need Lu Ding's reminder; after seeing the monster disguised as an old man, she wouldn't dare go anywhere before dawn.\n\nLet alone try to escape using the elevator or take that pitch-black emergency stairwell.\n\nSeeing Lu Ding about to float out through the broken doorway, Dong Wenrui subconsciously asked, \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"There are other things in this building. I'm going to clean them up.\"\n\nHearing there were more monsters, Dong Wenrui's body trembled a few times.\n\n\"You... you be careful.\"\n\nLu Ding floated away, and the main door collapsed with a crash.\n\nAfter he left, Dong Wenrui quickly ran into the bedroom, locked the door, and hid on the bed, starting to tremble uncontrollably.\n\n***\n\nOutside the apartment, Lu Ding went straight to the emergency stairwell.\n\nThe woman who had previously reported the case to the bureau said her family lived on the 19th floor, in 1911.\n\nThat was precisely Lu Ding's target location.\n\nDescending to the twentieth floor, just a few steps from the nineteenth, a young man was standing stock-still behind the stairwell door.\n\nSeeing the floating Lu Ding, his eyes showed none of the alarm a normal person should have.\n\nInstead, he spoke with a dissatisfied tone, \"How many times has the General said it? Be careful, be careful! Don't act differently from ordinary people, to avoid causing unnecessary trouble. We should be keeping a low profile right now, building high walls and stockpiling grain¹, waiting for the arrival of the fifteenth of the seventh month.\"\n\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing now? It's only a few days away, can't you wait even a little while?\"\n\n\"Are those damn legs of yours just for show? Can't you just climb the stairs? Or if that's too much, take the elevator! Dammit, it's been this long and you still haven't learned how to use an elevator? We got you such a good-looking body for nothing.\"\n\n\"Speaking of which, this body of yours is good-looking, but why do you look so unfamiliar...\"\n\nLu Ding listened to the man's words without interrupting.\n\nGeneral. The fifteenth of the seventh month. Build high walls, stockpile grain.\n\nThe person he mentioned must be the mastermind. General... seems he's an ancient ghost, one who held an official rank and even has a bit of culture.\n\nAs for the fifteenth of the seventh month, that's the Ghost Festival. Could it be these things are planning to stir up trouble on the Ghost Festival?\n\nLu Ding shot forward at extreme speed, raising a hand to grab the man's body and slam him against the wall. A section of the hard wall behind him shattered.\n\nA slash cut down, and an arm fell, rolling on the ground.\n\nThe pain made the man want to scream, but his jaw was crushed in Lu Ding's grip, making cracking sounds and preventing him from uttering a single word.\n\n\"Now, I ask, you answer. If you're a second too slow, you'll be seeing your own brain matter.\"\n\n\"Who is this General you speak of?\"\n\nThe demonic being hidden inside the man's body had a defiant look in its eyes; it had no intention of answering any questions.\n\nLu Ding did exactly as he had said.\n\nThe demonic being's skullcap flew off, and its brain matter splattered across the white wall.\n\nLu Ding casually tossed the corpse aside.\n\n\"It seems you lot are quite loyal. Forget it, I'll just go find it myself in 1911.\"\n\nLeaving the emergency stairwell, Lu Ding floated to the door of 1911.\n\nWith one kick, he shattered the door and its frame to pieces, revealing a family of three inside, eating 'dinner.'\n\nTwo old ones, and one young one.\n\nIf nothing had gone wrong, these should be the informant's replaced parents-in-law and child.\n\nThe three monsters were also stunned for a moment when they saw Lu Ding.\n\nEspecially when they saw him floating without his feet touching the ground, the confusion in their eyes deepened.\n\nWhat is this thing? Is it human, or a monster like us?\n\nIn their fixed view of the world, humans couldn't fly.\n\nThe old man stood up.\n\n\"What manner of demon are you? This is a garrison of my Pei Family Army! Leave at once, and I can overlook this matter!\"\n\nLu Ding laughed. \"I'm what manner of demon?\"\n\nFucking hell, the roles are reversed.\n\nHe, a man of righteous and proper standing, was being called a demon.\n\nAs if teleporting, he moved forward and kicked out. The old man was sent flying, sinking into the wall.\n\nHe spewed mouthfuls of green ichor.\n\nThe old woman beside him rose to lunge for the kill. Lu Ding raised his hand and a cold glint appeared, flashing from bottom to top. Under the room's dim light, the old woman's shadow was reflected, split into three, as countless long, coiling objects scattered across the floor.\n\nHe snatched up the child that the ghost had replaced. Before Lu Ding could even act—\n\nThe old ghost embedded deep in the wall, unable to move, shouted intermittently, \"Let... let go of the Young Master! If you want someone, come for me!\"\n\nBoth of its legs were sliced off at the hip.\n\n\"Don't give me this 'loyal servant protecting the master' act.

Otherwise, this little bastard will die in my hands, piece by piece, just like this.\"\n\nThe little monster the old ghost called 'Young Master' had an arm brutally and forcefully torn off by Lu Ding.\n\nIn that moment, he was even more savage than these monsters who had replaced human bodies.\n\n\"Ahhhhhh!!!!! Dad!!!!\"\n\n\"Shut up. Screaming for your grandpa wouldn't do you any good, and you're screaming for your dad.\"\n\n\"I'll talk!!!

    "content": "「Whatever you want to ask, I'll tell you, just ask quickly!!\"\n\nLu Ding turned his head, the brutality in his eyes startling the old ghost, who was himself a monster.\n\n\"What's your General Commander's name, what's his full name, and why are you garrisoning troops?\"\n\nThe old ghost was quite sensible, answering quickly without any hesitation: \"Our General Commander's surname is Fang, given name Du. We're garrisoning troops here to await the General's revival. I advise you to leave quickly, or else when the General Commander returns, you'll suffer greatly. The child in your hand is the General Commander's youngest son.\"\n\nFang Du?\n\nNever heard of him. I'll check the historical records using 749's data later.\n\nAs for the General's revival...\n\nLu Ding tore off another of the little ghost's arms: \"I don't like being threatened, nor do I want to hear harsh words.\"\n\n\"Now tell me, where did your General Commander go, and where is your General, what's his name? When will he revive?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, I'll tell you.\"\n\nBlood was still gushing continuously from the old ghost's mouth.\n\nBut he couldn't care about that anymore.\n\n\"The General Commander went out tonight to look for his wife; his wife was released by the Young Master. Our General's surname is Pei, given name Ziyi, sealed 'Broken Ridge Jade-Faced Great General.' He will revive during the Mid-Seventh Month¹ when Yin energy is at its strongest. As for where he is, I don't know, and the General Commander doesn't know either, but we know the General is in Yunhai.\"\n\nLu Ding's expression was strange as he listened.\n\nAlthough he didn't know who this Pei Ziyi was, \"Jade-Faced Great General\"...\n\nHe remembered that the living corpse he had killed, which was undergoing metamorphosis, seemed to be wearing a jade mask.\n\nLu Ding asked tentatively: \"Then I should know who it is. Was your General buried using a secret suspended coffin method, with a jade mask on his face when interred?\"\n\nThe old ghost's face showed shock.\n\n\"Yes!! Yes!! How do you know? Have you met our General!?\"\n\nIndeed, he was right.\n\nThis was an accidental resolution to a big problem.\n\nLu Ding twisted off the little ghost's head, splitting the corpse's head in two, and casually tossed it aside.\n\n\"I've seen your General. Saying that might not be accurate; it should be, your General was killed by me when I pried open his coffin. He died just like this little beast, in pieces, not even a complete corpse left behind.\"\n\n\"You!!! You!!!! Impossible!! This is absolutely impossible!!! You petty insignificant person, speaking empty words, how could the General...\"\n\nBefore he finished speaking, Lu Ding walked directly past him into the bedroom, a head slowly rolling into view behind him, its face full of unwillingness and fury, forever frozen in that moment.\n\nThe yellow wood-grained wardrobe stood before him.\n\nThis was the wardrobe that the informant claimed contained a monster.\n\nBut no matter how Lu Ding looked at it, it didn't seem like an Yin artifact capable of hiding Yin ghosts.\n\nHe raised his hand and split open the wardrobe door.\n\nHe saw fresh blood flowing from the damaged part of the wardrobe.\n\nBoom, boom, boom...\n\nThe building began to shake. If Lu Ding had been outside the building at that moment, he would have seen that the building he was currently in was constantly flickering.\n\nJust like the image played on an old, poorly connected VCR from the past.\n\nFlickering, phantom images, overlapping, stuttering.\n\nInside the wardrobe, which was originally empty, an old, crack-covered doorway now appeared out of thin air.\n\nYin energy wafted out from it.\n\nLooking from the outside in, it was actually a room identical to the bedroom outside.\n\n\"Yin Domain Overlap?\"\n\nLu Ding uttered the profound nature of this place.\n\nYin Domain Overlap, something only powerful ghostly entities could manifest.\n\nHumans are divided into life and death, matters into Yin and Yang. The place where living people reside is the Yang World, and the place where dead people reside is the Yin World.\n\nIn mythological stories, that is where the Ten Halls of Yama, Ox-Heads and Horse-Faces, Black and White Impermanence, and other Yin World deities reside.\n\nThe Yin World is different from the Yang World; it possesses rules different from the Yang World.\n\nAnd a Yin Domain is something condensed from a powerful ghostly entity's own power.\n\nThe birth of a Yin Domain is a reflection of the powerful ghostly entity's own rules of power. From the moment of its birth, the rewriting of its rules is already predetermined.\n\nAs for what these rules are, simply put: living people need oxygen—this is a rule; falling from a high place will result in death—this is a rule; the majority of a living person's body is water—this is also a rule.\n\nMonsters that derive Yin Domains possess the right to rewrite the rules of *their* Yin Domain, but only within that Yin Domain, and it is a one-time process; once rewritten, it cannot be rewritten again.\n\nA Yin Domain can exist independently, or it can attach itself to existing objects in reality.\n\nYin Domain Overlap is when a Yin Domain attached to reality and the balance of reality are broken, leading to their superimposition.\n\nThe door that appeared inside the cabinet before him was the point where the Yin Domain and reality connected.\n\nFeeling the surging Yin energy within.\n\nOutside, footsteps were chaotic. Lu Ding understood that this must have alarmed the monsters inside the Yin Domain, as well as the 'people' in this building whom the monsters had replaced.\n\nDownstairs, 706.\n\nA woman, about to rest, watched as her husband, who should have been washing up in the bathroom, suddenly rushed out, naked, and sprinted towards the door.\n\nDownstairs, 514.\n\nHer husband had already fallen asleep. The old woman, exhausted from a day's work, was just about to go to bed when she saw her old man, who needed a wheelchair to go out every day, sit up ramrod straight and run towards the door at a brisk pace.\n\nThe old woman watched, stunned.\n\nWas she having hallucinations?\n\nSituations like this were constantly happening in the homes of other residents in this building.\n\nSome were individuals, some were entire families.\n\nThese sprinting 'people' all had only one target: 1911.\n\nAt the same time.\n\nOn the road outside Baofan District Public Security Bureau, a sedan was parked.\n\nA man sat in the car, hands on the steering wheel, his eyes fixed intently on the Public Security Bureau before him.\n\n\"My wife, you shouldn't have discovered these things. My sincerity towards you is witnessed by heaven and earth. Why, why must it be like this...\"\n\nAs he spoke, the man's expression grew increasingly ferocious. Armor appeared on his body, and his face transformed from that of an ordinary middle-aged man into a fierce, scarred ghostly visage.\n\nThis person was precisely the General Commander mentioned by the old ghost. He had followed the woman's scent all the way to the Public Security Bureau.\n\nHis heart was in a fierce internal struggle²; he loved the woman.\n\nBut the informant had twice tried to disrupt his plans, so he could only, with a heavy heart, decide to silence her.\n\nYet, before he could even kill his way into the Public Security Bureau,\n\nA sensation arose in his mind: someone had broken the wardrobe in 1911, disrupting the balance between the Yin Domain and reality, causing an Yin Domain Overlap, exposing it to the eyes of the world.\n\nThe man instantly flew into a rage, his tall body tearing through the human skin stretched over him.\n\n\"You deserve to die!!! No matter who you are!!!! You must die!!!\"\n\nNow, it no longer cared about the people inside the Public Security Bureau. It soared directly, bursting through the car roof, carrying swirling black mist, and pressed towards the distant Dinghao residential area.\n\nRoom 1911.\n\nLu Ding pulled out his phone and dialed the 749 manual hotline.\n\n\"Hello, this is Lu Ding, patrol investigator for Yunhai's Baofan District. I need to report a situation.\"\n\n\"Alright, please proceed.\"\n\n\"Baofan District, Dinghao Residential Area, Building Five: a Yin Domain Overlap has occurred, and a powerful ancient ghostly entity is hoarding provisions and raising an army here.\"\n\n\"Yin Domain Overlap!!!!\"\n\nAt the 749 General Bureau's switchboard department, the staff member wearing headphones instantly stood up and shouted.\n\nImmediately, everyone's attention was drawn to him.\n\n\"Investigator Lu, please bear with it for a moment, or withdraw now and wait for other investigators to arrive so you can join forces to exterminate the monster and seal the Yin Domain.\"\n\nLu Ding turned his head to look; monsters that had replaced living people had already rushed to the door.\n\nThe instant one stepped through the doorway, a surging slash erupted, and the wall, door frame, and monster all exploded simultaneously.\n\n\"I can't retreat now. Hurry up and send people to clean up the mess³. This matter will be a huge commotion today.\"\n\n---\n¹ Mid-Seventh Month: Refers to the seventh month of the lunar calendar, often associated with the Ghost Festival, where the gates of the underworld are believed to open.\n² fierce internal struggle: An idiom meaning a fierce internal struggle or dilemma, literally \"heaven and human warring in the heart.\"\n³ clean up the mess: An idiom meaning to clean up a large-scale mess or aftermath, often implying a thorough suppression or cover-up.",

    "content": "The moment the call ended, everyone in the dispatch department sprang into action.\n\n\"Quick! Check if there are any investigators passing near Dinghao Residential Area, send them messages to immediately support Dinghao Residential Area!!!\"\n\n\"Immediately issue an urgent notice, informing the nearby Anhong District, Luding District, and Taisi District in Baofan District, for their patrol investigators to proceed immediately!!\"\n\n\"Notify the aftermath department to go to Dinghao Residential Area for cleanup; they must ensure no monsters escape and thoroughly clear the area!!\"\n\n\"Satellite, communication barrier, network monitoring, road closures, hazard coordination, activate all!!\"\n\n\"Have the local departments issue earthquake warnings and prepare seismographs.\"\n\nDowntown areas are different from other places; a serious response is imperative.\n\nWhen something like a Shadow Domain overlap occurs in a place like Dinghao Residential Area, the first priority is to ensure the safety of ordinary citizens' lives and property.\n\nRoad closures are mandatory; as for network monitoring, that's to prevent news of the Shadow Domain from leaking online.\n\nAnd seismographs and earthquake warnings are things needed for the aftermath.\n\nIn case of casualties, an explanation will certainly be required, and natural disaster is the best explanation.\n\nThe state will also provide various compensations, from all aspects.\n\nUnit 749's speed was swift.\n\nLu Ding couldn't slow down either.\n\nHundreds of monsters, having replaced \"humans,\" surged up and down the entire building.\n\nLu Ding blocked the entrance to Room 1911, unleashing full firepower. Slashes swept out like a lawnmower, slicing and dismembering the charging monsters one by one.\n\nThe power was immense.\n\nEven the hallway walls, floor, and ceiling outside Room 1911 were left with deep gashes.\n\nBut the things outside weren't the greatest threat; the biggest threat was what was inside the Shadow Domain.\n\nIn a state of unconsciousness, a Shadow Domain overlap requires time to complete.\n\nBefore the complete overlap, the old ghosts accumulated in the Shadow Domain could only emerge from the bedroom wardrobe opening in Room 1911.\n\nLu Ding simultaneously hacked down those charging from outside and blocked things emerging from within.\n\nHe didn't care who came; if one popped its head out, he killed one; if two came out, he killed a pair. He was like a god of war, blocking the spawn point and slaughtering.\n\nBang!!!\n\nOne kick! After enduring countless hardships and dodging numerous slashes, the monster had just charged in front of Lu Ding, yet before it could even attack, Lu Ding kicked it flying, smashing through the wall and tumbling into Room 1910.\n\nThe original occupants there had already turned into monsters and been slain by Lu Ding.\n\nCountless corpses lay around him, minced flesh carpeted the floor, and blood flowed like a river.\n\nLu Ding floated above the pile of corpses.\n\nHis hands were spread wide at his sides; he radiated a powerful aura, like a king standing amidst a battlefield.\n\nHe commanded the situation, powerful, composed, and arrogant.\n\nThe monsters outside were slaughtered to extinction. In the narrow hallway, Lu Ding's casual slashes passed through as if a red-hot blade was cutting butter, without the slightest resistance.\n\nAll that remained were the Shadow Domain monsters existing within the wardrobe's opening.\n\nLu Ding blocked the door and shouted, \"Come on, charge again!!!\"\n\nThe Shadow Domain hadn't fully merged yet; what he needed to do was trap and kill all these things within the Shadow Domain, preventing them from coming out.\n\nThe monsters of the Shadow Domain were momentarily stunned.\n\nBut in the past, they were fierce beings who had fought their way through mountains of knives and seas of fire*.\n\nAnd they had died once already.\n\nOf course, they weren't afraid of dying again.\n\nA half-rotted monster, clad in heavy armor, through whose gaps faint white bones could be seen below.\n\nIt stood amidst the horde of ghosts. With a hoarse voice, it shouted, \"Heavy shields forward, spears second rank, blades and axes third line!!!\"\n\nMonsters holding human-height heavy shields lined up and arranged their shields. Through the gaps, faded and rusted spearheads emerged one by one. Finally, monsters with flat heads raised their blades.\n\nA military formation of iron and blood, nothing less.\n\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\n\nThe heavy shield soldiers pushed forward, each step a pound, with majestic momentum.\n\nLu Ding remained unmoved, his gaze falling on the heavily armored monster that had given the orders earlier.\n\n\"You're still a leader.\"\n\n\"Throw!\" As the heavily armored monster gave the command.\n\nFrom behind the heavy shields, long spears flew out one by one, moving at extreme speed, heading straight for Lu Ding.\n\nHe glanced at the wardrobe where he was located.\n\nLu Ding shook his head slightly.\n\nNever mind, compared to blocking them, killing them is simpler.\n\nHe raised his hand, summoning howling winds that blew away the thrown spears.\n\nThe Wind Stabilization Art could not only make Lu Ding fly but also summon howling winds, thereby further increasing the user's flying speed.\n\nAt this moment, Lu Ding's speed was elevated to its extreme.\n\nHis figure flew into the Shadow Domain, and behind him, a spectral Flying Bear gradually rose, crushing its way towards the military formation within the Shadow Domain.\n\nCharge!\n\nThe tall, ferocious Flying Bear, carrying Lu Ding, slammed into the monster military formation.\n\nIt wantonly tossed, tore, and crushed the monsters that were once proud, fierce soldiers.\n\nLu Ding casually struck, crushing the monster holding the tall shield that had charged to trap him, shattering both shield and monster into scattered flesh and blood.\n\nHe glanced back, his slash clearing ten meters flat, like mowing grass.\n\nWithin the military formation, two monsters held shields to form a bridge. The heavily armored monster flew onto the bridge, holding a spiked bronze hammer, clad in tiger-devouring layered armor. With hands crossed, it performed a 'forceful split of Mount Hua'**, flying down to ambush Lu Ding, aiming to smash his head open.\n\n\"No matter how strong or fierce you are, you're just another wronged soul beneath my hammer!!\"\n\nBang!!!\n\nThe heavily armored monster's face showed alarm.\n\nIt saw Lu Ding, with one hand, grasp the tip of the attacking spear, not allowing it to advance an inch, and with the other, parry the bronze hammer as if supporting the sky, not yielding an inch.\n\n\"You shout loudly, but unfortunately, you're a weak-handed, soft-hammered piece of trash. In your next life, be reborn and eat a few more years before trying again!\"\n\nBoth hands exerted force simultaneously; the spear shattered, the hammer cracked.\n\nThe spectral Flying Bear turned and roared, its expanding sound waves carrying the power of True Qi, flaying the heavily armored monster layer by layer with its roar, causing its armor to shatter, flesh to disperse, bones to detach, and finally turn to dust and vanish.\n\n[Monster Contained: Drum-Pounding Ghost Leader]\n\n[Containment Reward: Drum-Beating Heart Tremor]\n\n[Drum-Beating Heart Tremor: Using Qi to form a hammer, and flesh as a drum, it can vibrate internal organs and the heart and lungs, causing those who hear it to explode and die. It can also use the drum technique to temper internal organs and the body, enhancing physical strength.]\n\nThe Drum-Pounding Ghost Leader, as recorded in military annals, describes how in some dynasties, armies would gather soldiers on specific days each year, set up a large drum taller than a person, with a hundred-jin drum hammer, and have soldiers lift the hammer to strike the drum. Those who achieved ten strikes would receive silver, twenty strikes would be enlisted into the general's personal guard. Fifty strikes would make one a \"Hammer Head,\" responsible for sounding the drum on the battlefield. This was not a dignified or safe job; those capable of doing it had to be first-rate fierce individuals, possessing great strength, quick minds, and also tasked with guarding the drum, similar to the banner guard unit, just not as elite.\n\nThis Drum-Pounding Ghost Leader was formed from a ferocious soldier who died after pounding the drum.\n\nFinally, a reward had dropped.\n\nHaving gained a new technique, Lu Ding was somewhat impatient.\n\nHe immediately channeled Qi into his body, using Qi to resonate the drum, bringing down a hammer strike, Bang!!!\n\nA muffled drum sound reverberated forth, a visible sound wave burst open, and the surging monsters exploded on the spot in swathes, scattering flesh and blood across the sky.\n\nBy the time Fang Du, having ripped through his human skin, flew back to Dinghao Residential Area, smashed through the window of Room 1911, and landed inside...\n\n...he only saw scattered limbs and flesh everywhere.\n\nThe monstrous soldiers he had replaced were all dead.\n\n---\n* *Mountains of knives and seas of fire*: A metaphor for extremely dangerous or difficult situations.\n** *Forceful split of Mount Hua*: A martial arts technique describing a powerful, downward cleaving strike.",

    "content": "Lu Ding sat on the only clean spot left on the sofa and said: \"You, as a Commander, deserted in battle, leaving behind a group of subordinates who I slaughtered like worthless rabble*. May I ask, how do you feel now?\"\n\nFang Du's body trembled.\n\nHis gaze swept over the narrow room once more, already thoroughly stained with blood and flesh.\n\nIt was in this very place that the human before him had crushed the soldiers he had replaced.\n\nFang Du looked at Lu Ding, his eyes filled with unwillingness: \"Ins... Inside...?\"\n\nLu Ding crossed his legs, his expression leisurely, resting his hand up to support his chin: \"All dead. Not a single one left for you. The outside was terrible, but the inside was even worse, blown to pieces. Do you remember you had a personal guard who played the war drums with a hammer?\"\n\nFang Du looked at Lu Ding, already having a guess in his heart.\n\nBut without hearing it from the person whose aura was pressing down on him, he still held a sliver of hope.\n\nAs a result, Lu Ding added with a playful expression: \"Died even more miserably. Not even chunks were left, beaten to powder.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahahahaha......\"\n\nLu Ding's laughter was wild, his expression arrogant. He stood up, rummaged through the pile of corpses nearby, and picked up a spherical object.\n\n\"Look, quick, look, this is your son. He screamed so miserably when he died. I even gave him special treatment.\"\n\nLu Ding raised his hand and tossed the no-corpse ghost head into Fang Du's arms.\n\nHe caught it with a trembling hand.\n\nLu Ding's voice continued: \"For others, I killed them with a single strike, without any pain. Only him, I first tore off his arms, then his legs, and saved his head for last to twist off. You heard right, twist, as in, I just twisted it off alive.\"\n\nAs he said this, the playful expression in his words was like a mischievous child tearing apart his own toy.\n\nHe spoke with ease and leisure.\n\nCoupled with a slightly exaggerated expression.\n\nIt successfully detonated Fang Du's mental state!!\n\n\"Ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nHe screamed with a tearing heart and lungs, ghostly energy permeating densely around his body.\n\n\"You beast! Don't harm wives and children! He's a child!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nLu Ding retorted directly: \"Spout your mother's bullshit! Your child is a child, but other people's children aren't children? Your son can't be killed, but other people's families of three can be killed at will?\"\n\n\"You even pulled off a magpie occupying a dove's nest**, a civet cat for a crown prince***. Be glad I was furious at the time and didn't torment this little beast too much. If I had been calmer, I would have given him death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nPerhaps Lu Ding's emotions were somewhat detached; he couldn't quite understand the pain a mother losing her child would endure.\n\nSo, what he could do was to make this guy lose his child too, to let it empathize properly with the complainant.\n\nMurder must be paid with life, whether in the past or now.\n\n\"I'll kill you!!!!\"\n\nGhostly energy surged. Fang Du raised his hand to condense ghostly energy, and a giant ghostly hand slammed down towards Lu Ding.\n\nA vertical cleave went forth, and the ghostly hand instantly split into two.\n\n\"Trash, you're truly trash! You couldn't protect your son, you couldn't protect your subordinates. Now you want to avenge them, but you find you can't do anything to me. Does it hurt? Do you despair?\"\n\n\"Die!!! You die for me!!!!!\"\n\nFang Du was furious to the extreme. He raised his hand, tore up the floorboards beneath his feet, and threw them. But the result was the same as before; they were cut into pieces before even reaching Lu Ding.\n\nThis guy had replaced living people and harmed a family of three.\n\nOf course, Lu Ding wouldn't let him die so easily.\n\nPhysical torment would have little effect on a ghoul transformed from such a fierce general.\n\nBut Lu Ding's words just now were different. To Fang Du's ears, they were striking at the heart****, critical hits with every word, directly hitting his weak spot.\n\nHis son lived then died, his soldiers appeared then disappeared, his wife came back then ran away.\n\nTsk tsk tsk.....\n\nLu Ding himself felt he was a bit bad.\n\nBut he really liked this feeling.\n\nThis was the right way to treat these beasts.\n\n\"I'll kill you! I will kill you! To avenge my soldiers, generals, and offspring!!!!\"\n\nThe dispersed ghostly energy, as Fang Du lost his reason, began to converge on his body, forming a thick armor. Beneath him appeared a tall black warhorse, its four hooves aflame, its eyes empty, emitting a ghostly, faint glow.\n\nFang Du mounted the horse.\n\nWith a grasp of ghostly energy in his hand, it transformed into an eight-foot horse lance, held level beneath his armpit. Behind him, ancient soldier phantoms appeared, each holding swords and spears, following behind him, their spearheads leveled at Lu Ding.\n\nAs the warhorse pawed the ground, Fang Du galloped forward, his long lance thrusting and parrying, carrying surging ghostly energy.\n\nThe next second.\n\nLu Ding was seen raising his hand, bare-handed, and grasping the lance shaft. Fang Du was in disbelief.\n\nWas he the monster, or was this 'human' the monster?!\n\nLet alone now that he had transformed from a human into a ghost, with greatly increased strength, even when he was alive as a human, he had never encountered anyone who could, while standing on foot, disarm his mounted spear bare-handed.\n\nWhat kind of monster could possess such power?\n\nFang Du exerted force, but Lu Ding remained unyielding, not taking a single step back, his expression relaxed.\n\n\"See? This is your strongest strike, yet it's still so weak and powerless. With such methods, you still think you can kill me? You couldn't protect your son, you couldn't protect your soldiers. Likewise, you can't kill me either.\"\n\nTerrifying immense force crushed the lance shaft. Lu Ding pulled it, making Fang Du, horse and all, stumble.\n\nHe then turned, extended his leg, and the ghostly energy scattered in the room surged backward from his foot due to how fast and brutal Lu Ding's kick was.\n\nAt this moment.\n\nLu Ding's expression constantly magnified in Fang Du's eyes.\n\nBrutality, callousness, and the indifference of a powerful being.\n\nBoom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWith one kick, Fang Du flew backward, smashing through the entire wall behind him. Half of his body was missing and shattered—this was caused by Lu Ding's single kick, showing how terrifying its power was.\n\nThe sensation of death surged like a tide once more.\n\nFang Du kept grasping at something in the air, scenes flashing before his eyes like a revolving lantern*****.\n\nThe warhorse that fell through the air with him was torn apart by a formidable force, transforming into scattered flesh and blood. Lu Ding shot straight through it, stomping his foot on the remaining half of Fang Du's chest.\n\nThe falling force and Lu Ding's power combined, the two forces converging and merging, carrying one human and one ghost like a cannonball, smashing from the 19th floor towards the ground floor.\n\nAt the same time.\n\nThe 749 Investigators who came to provide support had just entered the residential compound.\n\nThere were six people in total, all patrols from the three nearby districts.\n\n\"So annoying, so annoying! How can overlapping Yin domains be something we can handle? Aren't they just sending us to our deaths? Baofan District has incidents every day. Why doesn't my jurisdiction have any incidents?

I'm here today, not just to resolve the Yin Domain overlap, but also...\"\n\nBoom!!!!\n\nXue Ning hadn't finished speaking when a sound came from not far ahead, like something falling from a great height. But since everyone's attention wasn't on it, no one looked closely.\n\nDust billowed.\n\nLu Ding flat-out stomped Fang Du's body in half.\n\nHis upper and lower halves separated at the abdomen, intestines scattered across the ground.\n\nSeeing he still had a last breath, Lu Ding first looked at the group of people in the dust, then said in a low voice, \"From the mouths of your subordinates, I heard you're waiting for your general to revive, right?\"\n\nFang Du had long lost the strength to speak.\n\nHe merely clung to life, watching him with unwilling eyes, a sarcastic smile playing at the corner of his mouth.\n\nHis unwillingness stemmed from his inability to kill this monstrous man before him.\n\nThe sarcasm was that no matter how powerful this person was, once the general revived, he would be nothing more than another dead soul, a blood offering for the general.\n\nThe general would definitely avenge him!!!!\n\nDefinitely!!!!\n\nLu Ding saw what he was thinking. He leaned down slightly. \"No need to think. Your general died before you did, and I killed him too.

It is also simply called a Jiang Sha. Later generations are forbidden from burying armor with their commanders.\n\nPresumably, Fang Du, from whatever dynasty he was, no longer remembered these things, which is why he buried the general and armor together, resulting in this person becoming a Jiang Sha.\n\nIt's also possible he died on the battlefield and, by chance, merged and coexisted with it.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the General's Armor Adherence Technique is a renowned technique even within 749. Its usage is simple, its potential is high, its appearance is impressive, and it can also boost one's overall combat capabilities, including but not limited to speed, strength, and so on.\n\nHowever, the manifested appearance of the General's Armor Adherence Technique differs for each person.\n\nLu Ding was curious what his General's Armor would look like when manifested.\n\nBut now was not the time to study it.\n\nHe had clearly heard what those few people said earlier.\n\nBeyond the dust, footsteps cautiously approached.\n\nA group of six, each with tense expressions.\n\nSuddenly.\n\nThe dust stirred, and a black shadow flashed forth. Xue Ning held his spear horizontally to block.\n\nA tremendous force struck his spear shaft dead on.\n\nXue Ning's hand was completely torn open, the spear shaft in his hand bent, and he flew backward, stumbling and rolling for over ten meters before propping himself up with the spear and regaining his balance.\n\n\"I merely have a false reputation? You're nothing special yourself. Can't even hold a spear steady, yet you dare to spout nonsense and yap wildly behind my back.\"\n\nLu Ding floated more than two inches above the ground, his face angled as he glanced at Xue Ning, whose spearhead now rested on the ground because he couldn't grip the shaft.\n\nThat nonchalant tone, and the meaning behind his words, made everyone present's hearts tighten.\n\nThis was Lu Ding?\n\n\"Brother Xue Ning!!!\"\n\nThe girl eating a lollipop exclaimed, ignoring Lu Ding's forceful entrance.\n\nShe raised her hand and unleashed several flying knives straight at him.\n\nFacing the knives flying at his face, Lu Ding raised a hand and flicked several away. Then he clenched his hand, snatched one, and sent it flying back along its original path.\n\nIf the girl's flying knives had the power of pistol bullets...\n\nThen what Lu Ding sent back was a sniper shot.\n\nSingle shot, high precision, devastating power.\n\nIt tore through the air, carrying terrifying force, and nailed itself into the girl's shoulder, lifting her entire body along with it and sending her tumbling into a flower bed.\n\nThe flying knife entered through her collarbone, exited through her shoulder blade, its force undiminished, and finally embedded itself deep within the trunk of a banyan tree in the Dinghao Community's green space.\n\nLu Ding's figure floated motionless before the severely injured girl.\n\n\"Didn't you say Ming Jun and Bei Heguan were useless, and that Yan Feifan and I were even more absurd? Come on, get up. I'm willing to treat you as an opponent and go all out.\"\n\nThe investigator called 'Little Bear' didn't dare to respond. Her breathing was even becoming uneven.\n\nThe pressure Lu Ding exuded was too immense.\n\nNot only did he catch her flying knives bare-handed, but he could also, using her own methods, inflict such injuries on her with a single blow.\n\nIn that moment, it was instantly clear who the useless one was.\n\nXue Ning gripped his spear shaft tightly and rallied himself.\n\n\"What kind of skill is it to bully a woman? If you have guts, come at me!!\"\n\nLu Ding's figure seemed to teleport, appearing before Xue Ning without warning.\n\nAnother direct kick.\n\nThis time, Xue Ning didn't even have time to react. He was sent flying backward by the kick, smashing into the wall, with who knew how many bones broken.\n\n\"Come at you? What are you even? Barely blocking my last kick was just me going easy. Now, with the same method and the same attack, you wouldn't even see my shadow. If you lack ability, just keep it bottled up, endure it. That is the weak's way to survive.\"\n\nHe turned to look at the girl sitting on the ground. Her wound had been staunched, but her face was still pale.\n\n\"In the future, when you see me, it's best to take a detour, lest I can't resist cutting out your tongue.\"\n\nThe man who had initially advised the girl stepped in front of her, his gaze firm as he looked at Lu Ding. \"Investigator Lu,\" he said, \"we're here to help you. Isn't your way of doing things a bit too overbearing?\"\n\n\"Overbearing?\"\n\nLu Ding retorted.\n\nThen answered his own question, \"The strong are born to oppress the weak. The law of the jungle—where the strong prey on the weak—is an unchanging fundamental law of nature. Snakes eat mice, mantises catch cicadas; it's all the same.\"\n\n\"The reason humans are different is because the strong among them possess self-restraint, disdaining to bully those weaker than themselves. But this is not a reason for the weak to provoke the strong. Since she dared to provoke me with words, she must be prepared to face the consequences.\"\n\n\"You just spoke from a rational perspective, so I answered your question. Now I'm talking to her. If you like sticking your neck out, in the next second, you'll be lying in that corner.\"\n\nAs Lu Ding spoke, he gestured towards the flower bed about ten meters directly ahead.\n\nThe man swallowed a mouthful of saliva.\n\nLu Ding was tyrannical and brutal; he had long heard about it. \"Corpse-Rending Tai Sui\"—what a terrifying nickname! And yet, the owner of such a nickname was still an investigator for 749.\n\nBut these were all just rumors; he knew the name but hadn't met the man.\n\nOnly after personally witnessing and experiencing it today did the man understand that the rumors outside were greatly exaggerated.\n\nNot only was he cruel to monsters and brutal to enemies, but he wouldn't show any leniency even to his own people who provoked him.\n\nHowever, it couldn't be called unreasonable either. After all, Xiong Lan was the one who gossiped about him behind his back first, and it just happened to be overheard.\n\nThe girl hid behind the man, cautiously poking out half her head. Trembling with fear, she stuttered in response to Lu Ding's words: \"I... I know. I won't dare to speak carelessly again. I'm sorry. So... so sorry, Lu Ding. I apologize to you.\"",

    "content": "And so.\n\nLu Ding was quite satisfied.\n\n\"Alright, someone take that one over there to the hospital. The rest of you clean up the battlefield and cooperate with the Aftermath Department personnel who will be arriving soon to maintain order at the scene.\"\n\nHe couldn't stand being in this place for another second.\n\nHis body was stained with too much monster blood and battle dust.\n\nHe reeked; he couldn't stand it. He had to quickly return to the Public Security Bureau for a shower.\n\nHe turned and flew into the long, dark sky.\n\nEveryone's astonishment reached another level.\n\nHe can fly!!!?\n\nWhen they previously saw Lu Ding floating, they thought it was just some minor trick of manipulating Qi to borrow wind, and never once considered actual flight.\n\nOne must understand that floating and flying are not the same concept.\n\nThat's why, within Bureau 749, the category of spectral entities is notoriously difficult to deal with, and almost no one is willing to take on containment missions.\n\nThat's because, not only are their abilities strange and varied, but they are also naturally capable of floating, and once they reach a certain level of power, they can fly extremely fast.\n\nIf a situation arises where they can't be defeated, they'll run.\n\nShooting up like a spring onion*, they simply vanish. You can't hit them, and you can't catch them.\n\nIf Qi Refiners could also fly, then the threat posed by spectral entities would actually not be as great as that of the various diverse monsters.\n\nHowever, secret arts of flight are simply inaccessible to ordinary people; they can't learn them, nor do they possess the vast amount of Qi required to sustain prolonged flight or levitation.\n\nTherefore, the fact that Lu Ding could fly once again brought a different kind of shock to the few people present.\n\nAs they turned again, the smoke behind them had dissipated, revealing Fang Du, dead on the ground, to their eyes.\n\nAlthough already deceased,\n\nhis rapidly decaying remains still emitted an extremely terrifying aura.\n\nEven just getting a little closer, they could feel waves of chilling coldness washing over them.\n\n\"This... is this the monster that created the Yin Domain?\"\n\n\"Barring any accidents, it should be. There can't possibly be anything stronger than this thing, can there? Then...\"\n\nThe speaker paused, turned to look around, then continued, \"Could Lu Ding handle that?\"\n\nAfter speaking, he felt it was inappropriate and quickly added, \"I'm not questioning Investigator Lu's strength, no. What I mean is, if an even stronger monster appeared, this neighborhood would have been destroyed long ago. How could it have lasted until Patrol Inspector Lu arrived?\"\n\nThe few of them chatted aimlessly.\n\nSoon, personnel from the Aftermath Department arrived, all dressed in black, wearing gas masks, and carrying numerous bags and complete equipment.\n\nSome took photos, others handled the aftermath.\n\nFinally, when they emerged from the emergency exit and saw the battlefield on the 19th floor, everyone felt that even hell on earth couldn't be much worse.\n\nDismembered limbs, pus-filled blood, rotting flesh.\n\nDeep slashes left on the walls, floor, and ceiling told them what kind of terrifying battle had occurred here.\n\nWas this really, killed by one person...?\n\nCan a probationary investigator truly accomplish this much?\n\nThey dared not believe it in their hearts, yet they had no choice but to believe, because other than Lu Ding, there had been no other investigators here previously, nor any combat traces left by a second person.\n\nEverything suggested that Lu Ding had done this alone.\n\nStepping into Room 1911.\n\nThe pus-filled blood and rotting flesh beneath their feet clung to their soles, drawing out sticky threads.\n\nThis was also why Lu Ding chose to float rather than fight on the ground.\n\nBeing cool was only one aspect; more importantly, it was too filthy.\n\nUnretouched photos were sent back to Bureau 749, causing a huge stir.\n\nBattle cleanup information for Bureau 749 investigators is not hidden; instead, it is displayed for everyone to see.\n\nThe purpose of this is twofold: first, to inspire the weaker ones with the strong, and second, to send a message outwards, warning petty individuals that Bureau 749 investigators are like dragons across generations, producing talented individuals, so they absolutely should not stir up trouble.\n\nBut today, with Lu Ding's battle cleanup information released,\n\nthose investigators who had joined less than a year ago were all asking the same question.\n\n\"Are we still going to compete in this year's First-Year Combat Competition?\"\n\n\"Damn it, who's going to fight Lu Ding? You? Me? Or him? I don't know about others, but if I encountered Lu Ding, I wouldn't say more; I'd surrender directly. Hesitating for even a second would be disrespect to his battle achievements and his title.\"\n\n\"With this combat power, you're still mixing with probationary investigators? Isn't this bullying? Hurry up and get promoted! We were perfectly happy pecking at each other as newbies.\"\n\n\"First, there's Bai Hemian of Several Floating Pagodas, followed by Radiant Immortal Official Wen Ruchu, and Jade Guanyin Tantai Xianyue, forming a triangular stand-off, practically solidifying the top three spots for this year's First-Year Combat Competition. Now, another one has emerged, the Corpse-Dissecting Grand Marshal Lu Ding. Although we won't rank, we can at least watch the show!\"\n\n\"For the First-Year Combat Competition, only the top three can go for advanced training. Now there are four people, so one will inevitably be squeezed out. When that happens, those four will probably fight until their heads spin.\"\n\nA sweet, clear voice came from nearby: \"Brother, what is the First-Year Combat Competition?\"\n\nThe few people chatting turned to look and saw a girl in a white dress, smiling sweetly, standing under the light like the white moonlight** in one's youth.\n\nAs for those who didn't have white moonlight, congratulations, they now did.\n\nIf Lu Ding had been there, he would surely have recognized her as the Ji family's second daughter, Ji Yanshuang, whom he had saved previously.\n\nIt turned out that after the Ling Gu incident, Ji Yanshuang had unexpectedly awakened her Qi Refiner talent. She was discovered during an interview with Aftermath Department personnel and voluntarily petitioned to join Bureau 749.\n\nNow, after several days, she was originally planning to take a note and go home to see her older sister and father.\n\nBut just as she came out, she heard people discussing Lu Ding.\n\nThat's why Ji Yanshuang came up to ask.\n\nA polite \"brother\" had these few people eagerly scrambling to answer her question:\n\n\"This First-Year Combat Competition, well, it's a competition that only investigators who have joined for less than a year can participate in.\"\n\nSomeone nearby added, \"Investigators who joined one month before the previous First-Year Combat Competition can also participate in the next one, because you can't cultivate much in just a month.\"\n\nA third person spoke up: \"There are a total of ten reward slots. The rewards for fourth to seventh place aren't vastly different, but they're all good things. However, the top three are different; they can enter an advanced training facility jointly established by Bureau 749 branches across the country for further study.\"\n\n\"The purpose is to select highly talented prospects and provide them with training and enhancement.\"\n\nJi Yanshuang looked thoughtful: \"So, is the competition fierce this year?\"\n\n\"Fierce doesn't even begin to describe it! Let me tell you, those three people we just talked about—every single one of them is no pushover. Jade Guanyin Tantai Xianyue possesses the Guanyin Great Luminous Form; her strength is formidable. A while ago, she alone fought a snake spirit in Ninglong City that intended to transform into a flood dragon. She fought so hard that the dam collapsed!\"\n\n\"She successfully held it off until reinforcements arrived, and only then did the snake spirit escape. That was a snake spirit comparable to a Spirit Sea Ninth Stage Qi Refiner. Once it successfully transformed into a flood dragon, it would be on par with a Divine Palace Realm Qi Refiner.\"\n\n\"Being able to hold off such a monster, do you think she's strong or not?\"\n\nJi Yanshuang spoke up: \"But didn't Lu Ding kill an experienced Spirit Sea Qi Refiner back in Zhaoxuan?\"\n\nMan: ......\n\n---\n*   **Shooting up like a spring onion (旱地拔蔥)**: Lit. \"springing up from dry ground like a spring onion.\" An idiom describing someone or something suddenly and rapidly ascending or appearing.\n**   **White moonlight (白月光)**: Lit. \"white moonlight.\" A term often used in Chinese internet culture to refer to someone who is an idealized, often unattainable, first love or a person one deeply admires from afar, representing purity and beauty.",

    "content": "......\n\nAnother person continued.\n\n\"Then listen to this one: the Gentle Immortal Official, Wen Ruzhu. He's kind and gentle, comes from a family of billionaires, and even awakened two talents. He was once hunted by a powerful Spirit Sea realm cultivator from an evil cult. In that desperate situation, he broke through to the Spirit Sea realm and killed his pursuer. To be able to kill a Spirit Sea cultivator right after reaching the Spirit Sea realm, wouldn't you say he's incredible? And he possesses two talents, no less.\"\n\nJi Yanshuang thought for a moment. \"How long ago did this Gentle Immortal Official join 749?\"\n\n\"He joined around the end of September last year. The incident I mentioned happened this May,\" the man answered truthfully.\n\n\"But Lu Ding only joined 749 this August, and he killed a Spirit Sea cultivator in Zhaoxuan.\"\n\nThe second person: ......\n\n\"Yes, Lu Ding is incredible, no doubt. But Bai Hemian is even more so. Their combat records are on par with each other, as are their temperaments and methods. Most importantly, Bai Hemian has been cultivating for several months longer than Lu Ding. When their talents are both terrifyingly high, time becomes the deciding factor.\"\n\nJi Yanshuang: \"I heard he was put in solitary confinement?\"\n\nThe third person: ......\n\n\"He'll be let out.\"\n\nJi Yanshuang: \"Doesn't it just have to be one of the top three? The other two can't beat Lu Ding.\"\n\nThe men: ......\n\nThat made a lot of sense.\n\nHer answer was just like the old joke: when you encounter a wild beast, it doesn't matter if you can outrun the beast; what matters is if you can outrun the person next to you.\n\nSeeing that the three men's moods seemed a bit off, Ji Yanshuang realized she might have been too earnest. She quickly bowed in apology. \"I'm sorry, you three big brothers. Investigator Lu saved me, so I think he's the most powerful. My apologies, my apologies.\"\n\nThe men opened their mouths, wanting to say something but stopping themselves. No wonder she was speaking up for Lu Ding like that.\n\nActually, if they thought about it carefully, she wasn't wrong. Lu Ding was indeed incredible, powerful, and scientifically inexplicable.\n\nA monster, plain and simple.\n\nThe reason the men didn't favor Lu Ding was also that they were rather afraid of him.\n\nAlthough Bai Hemian's nickname and combat record were also brutal, at least he didn't resort to dismembering people at the drop of a hat.\n\nBy the time the men came back to their senses, Ji Yanshuang was already walking away, waving goodbye.\n\n\"So pretty, and with a great personality too. She even apologizes for her tone.\"\n\n\"Sweet-talker, great aura, calling us 'big brother' this and 'big brother' that... Dammit, why don't I have a sister like that!!!\"\n\n\"Hey! You guys said all the good stuff, what's left for me to say? Leave me some words, you damn bastards!!\"\n\n......\n\nBaofan District Public Security Administration Bureau.\n\nAfter returning, Lu Ding gave Gao Zhengliang a detailed report of the situation.\n\nThen he took a shower and headed to the interrogation room where the person who filed the report was.\n\nThe woman hadn't rested; she had been waiting for Lu Ding to return.\n\nStanding outside the door of the interrogation room, Lu Ding's heart was uneasy. Even when facing an army of ghosts in the Yin Domain, he had never felt this way.\n\nBut now, he truly didn't know what to say.\n\nWas he supposed to just say, \"Your husband, son, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are all dead, not even dust remains...\"?\n\nBut not saying it was impossible; the truth couldn't be hidden.\n\nIn the end, with no other choice, Lu Ding steeled himself and pushed open the door.\n\nThe moment she saw him enter, the woman stood up, her expression agitated, her voice trembling. \"Officer, my... my husband? How is my son? The monster... was there a monster?\"\n\nThe female security officer beside her quickly calmed her down, helping her sit.\n\nLu Ding came forward and took a deep breath. \"Miss Cheng, your family members have all been killed. But I've avenged you. I killed the monster, and I tore its son to pieces and dismembered it. You...\"\n\nHe really couldn't continue.\n\nThe expression on the woman's face had already frozen.\n\nThere was none of the hysterical crying and screaming he had imagined. There was only silence, despondence, as she sat limply in the chair.\n\nBefore, although her eyes were weary and terrified, they still held a spark of hope.\n\nBut now, it was gone. Everything was gone, completely gone, like a pool of stagnant water.\n\nTears rolled down her cheeks as she spoke.\n\nHer tears fell before she could speak a word.\n\n\"I know. I knew it all along. I thought so, but I was still holding on to some unrealistic hope. The monsters had become them... if I were a monster, I wouldn't have let them live either. Thank you, Officer. Thank you for avenging me.\"\n\nThe woman stood up. Her body was no longer swaying; her steps had become steady.\n\n\"When can I leave? I want to go back and see my home.\"\n\nLu Ding briefly described the situation at her house.\n\nThe woman smiled. \"It's alright, Officer. I don't need compensation. You're a good person. May I know your name?\"\n\n\"Lu Ding. My name is Lu Ding.\"\n\nThe woman carved this name into the depths of her heart.\n\nShe gave Lu Ding a deep bow.\n\nHer actions, her tone, her expression—all of it indicated that the woman no longer wanted to live, or rather, that she had lost all hope for life.\n\nBut Lu Ding couldn't find any words of comfort to say.\n\nHe only felt a stifling anger bottled up inside him, with no way to release it.\n\nIn the end, he could only walk out of the interrogation room with heavy steps.\n\nHe went alone to a dimly lit stairwell and lit a cigarette, the small ember glowing in the darkness.\n\nOne after another, until dawn arrived, light broke through the sky, and the ash fell.\n\nFootsteps approached from afar, until the person rounded the corner into the stairwell and looked at Lu Ding.\n\nGao Zhengliang spoke up. \"Patrol Leader Lu, our security officers from the subordinate Yinxing Public Security Substation have been detained by the Wuzang Sheng She.\"\n\nAs the old saying goes, blessings never come in pairs, but misfortunes never come alone.\n\nDemons and ghosts were stirring up trouble, and now people were, too.\n\nLu Ding flicked his cigarette butt, which hit the ground and sent a shower of sparks.\n\nHe was already full of pent-up anger with nowhere to vent it, and now the Wuzang Sheng She had to come and provoke him!\n\n\"Execute them. Bring them back and execute them immediately. Line them up and mow them down with a machine gun!\"\n\nGao Zhengliang was startled. He glanced at Lu Ding a few times, then lowered his voice and slowed his speech. \"It probably doesn't warrant execution... I was just hoping that since you're a Qi Cultivator from 749, and we in the Public Security Bureau have no authority over cultivators, you could perhaps help me communicate with them and get our people back.\"\n\nJust a moment ago, Gao Zhengliang had received a call from the chief of a subordinate precinct's public security substation.\n\nHe said that a few of their security officers, while investigating the smuggling of fruit in Baofan District, had accidentally stumbled upon the Wuzang Sheng She and people from the Kingdom of Zhenla trading something.\n\nA conflict had arisen in the middle of it.\n\nThe people from the Wuzang Sheng She had detained the security officers.\n\nThe chief of the Yinxing Public Security Substation knew that Qi Cultivators existed in the world and understood he couldn't get his people back on his own, so he reported it up to Gao Zhengliang.\n\nBut when Gao Zhengliang sent a message, they showed him no respect either, simply leaving him on read.\n\nHelpless, Gao Zhengliang had no choice but to find Lu Ding.\n\nIf he could have gotten them back himself, he certainly wouldn't have bothered Lu Ding, who had been working tirelessly all night.\n\n\"Ask for them back?\"\n\nLu Ding glanced at him, then slowly shook his head.\n\n\"This isn't asking. This is a rescue.\"\n\nHe still remembered how that Tang Hu from the Wuzang Sheng She had said he was a new broom sweeping clean, that he was ungrateful for the respect shown, and that he should watch his step.\n\nNow was the perfect time to settle the old and new debts all at once!\n\n\"Where is the Wuzang Sheng She? Take me there.\"\n\nHearing Lu Ding's emotionless voice, Gao Zhengliang's heart skipped a beat.\n\nThis is bad.\n\nSomething's about to happen.",

    "content": "...\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of town.\n\nThe Wuzang Sheng She was located in the Baofan District, on Wanjia Lianhe Street.\n\nThe area was also known as the Wanren Residential Area.\n\nAs mentioned before, Baofan District had been the most prosperous area in Yunhai in years past. Although it was no longer number one, it still ranked near the top.\n\nDue to this glorious past, Baofan District had become a place where dragons and fish swam together—a motley crew of inhabitants.\n\nThe Wanren Residential Area was a prime example.\n\nThis place used to be like a walled city, with households crammed next to and stacked on top of one another.\n\nLater, the government wanted to demolish it because it was too dangerous, but they couldn't get it done.\n\nThings dragged on like this for probably over a decade.\n\nWhen the officials saw there was no hope of demolition, they simply contracted the project out to a third party.\n\nLater still, the four founders of the Four Seas Group, just starting out, joined forces with the biggest landlords in the Wanren Residential Area. They managed to tear the place down and erect dense new apartment buildings in its stead.\n\nThis was what they had promised the residents of Wanren.\n\nThe Four Seas Group made its name with this project, officially entering the real estate industry, and has since branched out into various other sectors.\n\nThe Wuzang Sheng She was situated right in the Wanren Residential Area.\n\nAnd though the place was called the \"Ten Thousand People Residential Area,\" the number of people living within it wasn't just ten thousand; it was at least several times that.\n\nA high-density population, hailing from all corners of the country. With more people came more problems, and when you added in different customs and cultures, all sorts of strange and supernatural incidents became frequent in the early days.\n\nThis was how the Wuzang Sheng She got its start.\n\nThey helped the people of the Wanren Residential Area solve these problems.\n\nNormally, these matters could have been reported to the public security station, which would then report to the 749 Bureau. However, many residents of the Wanren Residential Area were people who couldn't afford to be in the light, so they would never report to the authorities.\n\nTo this day, the Wuzang Sheng She has become an existence akin to the Door Gods and the Kitchen God within the Wanren Residential Area.\n\nTheir incense burned strong.\n\nOn the first and fifteenth day of the lunar month, their incense cauldron, large enough to fit several people, would be emptied multiple times a day—that was how vigorous their worship was.\n\nThis was also why Tang Hu didn't give a damn about Lu Ding.\n\nConfidence!\n\nNourished by such a terrifying amount of worship, the patron spirits of the three men had become powerful to an extreme.\n\nThe three brothers couldn't manage it all on their own, so they had to bring in outside Qi cultivators to form the Wuzang Sheng She and work together.\n\nMore people meant more consumption.\n\nMoney could always be earned back if it was spent, but ritual consumables that were used up quickly were not so easy to find.\n\nThe major factions had their own supply channels.\n\nWhat did the Wuzang Sheng She have?\n\nAnd one listen to their name told you they didn't use ordinary materials.\n\nThings like human placentas,¹ human bones, human blood, the stalks and body parts of various protected animals and plants.\n\nThese things were hard to get in the country. On a small scale, the higher-ups could approve a small quota for you. For instance, with human blood, the national blood bank rotated its stock every year, and rituals weren't picky about blood types; as long as it was usable, it would do.\n\nAs for human placentas and bones, those could be obtained from hospitals and other miscellaneous places.\n\nThe paperwork was more or less compliant, but the quantity was insufficient.\n\nNot to mention the protected flora and fauna. So, what could they do?\n\nWell, what do you know! They had them over in Zhenla,² in large quantities and at a good price. If you wanted aged materials, they had them; if you wanted fresh, they had that too.\n\nThe Wuzang Sheng She was tempted.\n\nBut reporting to the 749 Bureau that they were going to Zhenla to buy these things was a bit unrealistic. So, the people of Wuzang Sheng She secretly tried to figure out their own channels.\n\nThey had made many transactions before without any issues.\n\nBut this time, something went wrong. A public security officer inspecting fruit discovered them. He had quietly opened the crates and found box after box of animal and plant parts, all sorts of bones, even skulls.\n\nWhat normal person wouldn't be scared or have second thoughts upon seeing such things?\n\nPublic security officers were human, too.\n\nAnd then he was caught in the act by the people from Wuzang Sheng She.\n\nWuzang Sheng She Headquarters.\n\nThe red glow of ritual lamps illuminated the room.\n\nThree gilded statues sat high on an altar with their registers, receiving incense offerings.\n\nA man, bare to the waist, with a lifelike tattoo of a tiger descending a mountain on his back, stepped in a divine pattern and performed a sacred dance, the whites of his eyes showing.\n\nThis was the second-in-command of the Wuzang Sheng She, Tang Hu, the \"Tiger Descending the Mountain\"!\n\nHe took a bundle of burning incense sticks and drew the lit tips across his muscular chest, face, abdomen, and arms, finally stuffing the burning ends into his mouth.\n\nTang Hu chewed with relish.\n\nHis white eyes instantly transformed, revealing a pair of amber pupils. His entire demeanor became savage and wild, like a fierce beast from the mountains.\n\nThe public security officers tied up to the side watched this scene, their hearts filled with astonishment.\n\nThis cult leader... actually seemed to have some real skills.\n\nOnly one of them remained defiant. After spitting out the rag stuffed in her mouth, she cursed loudly.\n\n\"Pah! A bunch of cultists!\"\n\n\"Do you know what the penalty is for detaining a public security officer? I advise you to think clearly, release us immediately, and turn yourselves in to seek lenient treatment.\"\n\nThe woman berated them sharply.\n\nHer name was Yan Biexie, a female officer from the Ginkgo Public Security Substation. Her mother was in politics, and her father was in business, so she had connections, but her work ethic was impeccable. She was highly efficient, just with a personality that was a bit too fiery.\n\nYou could tell from her words that she was straightforward and fierce.\n\nWith a person like this, you could say she was foolish—she was indeed foolish. To have ended up in a place like this, seeing this situation, and still be able to say such things.\n\nBut a public security officer needed to be just such a person.\n\nIf you were an ordinary person who had suffered an injustice and you ran into her, you could consider yourself extremely lucky.\n\nShe would definitely get involved, and she would see it through to the end. With her connections and her sense of justice, calling her a \"great blue sky lord\"³ wouldn't be an overstatement, though she did have a tendency to overstep her authority.\n\nTang Hu emerged from his trance-like state. He took a towel from a subordinate and carefully wiped the sweat from his face.\n\nHe lit a cigarette, crossed one leg over the other, and eyed Yan Biexie.\n\n\"Heh, you idiot. Who do you think is in control of the situation right now?\" Tang Hu sneered, pointing a thumb at himself. \"It's me. I'm in control. You talk to me like that, are you not afraid I'll make you suffer a little?\"\n\n\"Forget 'a little.' Come on! Kill me. If you've got the guts, then kill me. You think I'm afraid of a smuggler and cult organizer like you?\"\n\nHer words made Tang Hu pause for a moment. He had seen hard-headed people, but he had truly never seen someone as hard-headed as Yan Biexie.\n\nBut she had actually hit the nail on the head.\n\nNo matter how audacious he was, he wouldn't dare to kill Yan Biexie.\n\nDetaining a public security officer and killing a public security officer were two entirely different concepts.\n\nOriginally, Tang Hu's plan was to use threats and inducements to make these officers keep their mouths shut, to bury what they saw tonight deep in their hearts.\n\nDon't speak of it, and don't report it to their superiors.\n\nTo avoid attracting Lu Ding.\n\nHe and Lu Ding already didn't get along. In the past, the former enforcers had turned a blind eye when the Wuzang Sheng She bought these ritual supplies.\n\nBut Lu Ding didn't play ball,⁴ so it was impossible to gauge his attitude. Plus, his fearsome reputation was spreading. How could the Wuzang Sheng She not be careful?\n\nThe Ghost Festival was just around the corner, a time when strange incidents would occur frequently. The Wuzang Sheng She's stock of supplies was running low, which was why they had notified their contacts in Zhenla to bring the materials, with Tang Hu going to make the pickup, all before they could confirm Lu Ding's stance.\n\nAnd now they'd been busted by a public security officer. He was truly getting fed up.\n\nWhat little patience he had left vanished. He stood up, grabbed a handful of incense ash from the cauldron, and began rubbing it in his hands, imbuing it with a secret art.\n\n\"Tough mouth, huh!?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Human placentas:** The original term is `紫河車` (zǐ hé chē), the name for dried human placenta in Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n2.  **Zhenla:** An ancient Chinese name for Cambodia.\n3.  **Great blue sky lord:** The original is `青天大老爺` (qīng tiān dà lǎo yé), a term of high praise for an incorruptible and just official.\n4.  **Didn't play ball:** The original is `不來吃飯` (bù lái chī fàn), literally \"doesn't come to eat.\" This is a common idiom meaning someone refuses to participate in corrupt dealings, accept bribes, or be swayed by favors.",

    "content": "...\n\nA handful of incense ash was scattered over Yan Biexi, and a pain like being burned by fire instantly erupted, enveloping her entire body.\n\nYan Biexi clenched her jaw, her body trembling uncontrollably, sweat pouring down like rain, but she didn't let out a single scream.\n\nTang Hu watched her. \"Endure it. Keep enduring. Let's see how long you can last. Are you still thinking you can get out of here, get a medical examination, and cause trouble for me?\"\n\nA cold smile appeared on the man's face.\n\n\"You're overthinking it. You'll only feel pain; there won't be any injuries. Even the most sophisticated medical equipment won't be able to detect what you've been through. But if you cooperate with me, promise to keep your mouth shut about last night, and sign a confession, I can let you go. Otherwise...\"\n\nBefore he could finish his sentence.\n\nThe room's door, along with its frame and a chunk of the wall, shattered and scattered across the floor.\n\nLu Ding walked in from outside, finishing his sentence for him: \"Otherwise, what?\"\n\nGlancing at the tormented Yan Biexi, he raised a hand. A gentle breeze swept over her, a cooling sensation washing through her body.\n\nThe burning pain dissipated.\n\nBut a lingering fear remained in Yan Biexi's heart.\n\nIn those brief ten-odd seconds, she had felt as if she were trapped in a blazing fire, suffering immensely. She couldn't pass out, nor could she die. It was utter agony.\n\nThankfully, he had saved her.\n\nHer gaze fell on Lu Ding, and then on Gao Zhengliang behind him.\n\nAlthough she didn't recognize the young man, she had certainly seen Gao Zhengliang before.\n\nThe Director of the Baofan District Public Security Bureau.\n\n\"So, did the Director call him here...?\"\n\nLu Ding looked at the exhausted Yan Biexi and frowned slightly. In novels, whenever the protagonist saved someone, they always appeared at the critical moment to prevent the person from suffering. Why was it different for him?\n\n\"Lu Ding!! What is the meaning of this!?\"\n\nTang Hu demanded, \"You smashed the front of my Viscera Society and beat my men! If you don't give me an explanation today, I don't care if you're some Corpse-Dissecting Tai Sui from 749—you're not leaving!!!\"\n\nAs Tang Hu spoke, the group of Qi Refiners in the room instantly moved to surround Lu Ding.\n\nLu Ding scanned his surroundings, his expression betraying no emotion, and said in an indifferent tone:\n\n\"Threatening a 749 Patrol Investigation, attempting to besiege a 749 Patrol Investigator, illegally detaining a law enforcement officer, and torturing said officer. For these cumulative crimes, in my capacity as a 749 Patrol Investigator for the Baofan District, I sentence you to death. To be carried out immediately.\"\n\nAlong with Lu Ding's words came the same terrifying slash that had shredded hundreds of ghouls the night before.\n\nEveryone's heart seized in shock, but before they could even react, the crisp sound of slicing filled the air—the sound of flesh and bone being cut and severed.\n\nBlood burst forth in the room, and bits of flesh flew everywhere.\n\nLu Ding strode forward. Behind him, Gao Zhengliang had half-raised his arm, wanting to speak but stopping himself. He had intended to stop Lu Ding, but Lu Ding's speed was too great, and his determination to kill was too absolute.\n\nAs a result, before the words could leave his mouth or his body could move, Lu Ding had already taken care of everyone.\n\nHe was seen taking the seat of honor. With a lift of his hand, the three statues and the scroll on the shrine all turned to dust.\n\nHe then remarked, \"What kind of wild gods are you, to think you're worthy of being enthroned behind me.\"\n\nOn the floor, Tang Hu was missing the lower half of his body. His upper torso propped itself up on the blood-soaked ground, a scream stifled in his throat.\n\nLu Ding looked at his current state. \"This is the explanation I'm giving you. Satisfied?\"\n\nNow it was Lu Ding's turn to cross his legs.\n\n\"Weren't you talking about a new official lighting three fires?¹ And didn't you ask what was so special about me? Now I've lit those fires for you, and I've let you experience exactly *why* I'm so special.\"\n\n\"So, now, please tell me. What were you posturing for? Who gave you the nerve to capture a public security officer? And who gave you the nerve to threaten me?\"\n\nLu Ding watched him, his tone as casual as ever, his expression relaxed and leisurely, as if he were chatting idly with a friend.\n\nExcept this environment, and the person before him, were not suited for a chat.\n\n\"Hhh... hhh...\"\n\nThe pain made Tang Hu suck in sharp breaths. Smoke billowed behind him, carrying the faint scent of sandalwood that cut through the reek of blood in the room.\n\nA massive, lifelike tiger's head flickered in and out of view within it. This was the \"Old Immortal\" that possessed Tang Hu—a Mountain Lord who had achieved the Dao and descended the mountain to undergo its human trial. The '王' (king) character was etched on its forehead, a perfect display of its ferocious might. It was known as the Lord of the Forests, before whom beasts retreated and all evils were vanquished.\n\n\"If you want to cause trouble for me, come in your true form. Killing this illusory body manifested from your channeled Qi is a waste of my time. Get lost!\"\n\n\"ROAR!!!\"\n\nAs Lu Ding spoke, a bear's head materialized behind him. It let out a roar that seemed to come from the depths of the primordial wilderness, shaking one to the very soul.\n\nThe Mountain Lord in the smoke instantly shattered. Tang Hu, who had faced the roar head-on, was blasted into the wall by the Flying Bear's cry. He tumbled to the ground, no longer able to suppress his injuries, and spat out a mouthful of blood.\n\n\"You... you're the real deal... Lu Ding... I submit. The Corpse-Dissecting Tai Sui is truly as domineering and ruthless as they say.\"\n\nThis time, Tang Hu had truly submitted. He didn't dare not to. He was already severely wounded; if he didn't receive effective treatment soon, the Viscera Society's headquarters would become his grave.\n\nBut that wasn't what Lu Ding wanted to hear.\n\n\"Answer my question. Who gave you the nerve?\"\n\nA crushing pressure washed over Tang Hu, triggering his inner fear of death. The emotional turmoil aggravated his injuries, causing him to spit up another large mouthful of blood.\n\n\"No... nobody. I was wrong... I shouldn't have captured the public security officer, I shouldn't have threatened you... Please, spare me...\"\n\n\"Very good.\"\n\nLu Ding reached out and pressed the law enforcement recorder on his chest. That would serve as Tang Hu's confession.\n\nThen, Lu Ding raised his hand.\n\nThe half-body gasping for life on the floor was split in two, as dead as could be.\n\nLu Ding had carried out the sentence he had previously passed.\n\nCumulative crimes, death penalty, immediate execution.\n\nAs for the others, they had dared to entertain the thought of besieging him even after knowing he was a 749 investigator.\n\nTheir deaths were not worth mourning.\n\nInside the room, the few surviving public security officers and Gao Zhengliang were all dumbfounded. Their Adam's apples bobbed; they wanted to vomit but didn't dare.\n\nDead... all dead...\n\nAnd right in front of them, the public security officers, every last person had been cleanly slaughtered by the young man before them.\n\nYet they couldn't say a single word.\n\nBecause the three digits \"749\" were enough to explain everything.\n\nAlthough they didn't know the specifics of 749, they had heard rumors. This was the first time they had met a living member.\n\nGao Zhengliang's expression was bitter.\n\n*What am I supposed to do now?*\n\nIf he had known, he would have tried to think of another way himself instead of telling Lu Ding. Now, in one fell swoop...\n\nGao Zhengliang subconsciously scanned the room, wanting to do a headcount.\n\nBut the floor was covered in pieces of flesh smaller than his palm. How the hell was he supposed to get an accurate count?\n\nHe hadn't noted the number of people when he came in, either.\n\nGao Zhengliang gave up. *Screw it, I'm tired.*\n\n***\n\n¹A Chinese idiom meaning a newly appointed official makes several bold moves to establish their authority.",

    "content": "......\n\nHaving recovered some of his strength, Yan Biexie forced down the nausea in his heart and spoke up, \"Lu...\"\n\nHe listened to her struggle with the name for a long moment.\n\nLu Ding prompted him, \"Call me Enforcer Lu, Investigator Lu, or Lu Ding. Any of those are fine.\"\n\n\"Enforcer Lu, isn't this a bit against regulations? Shouldn't they be handed over to the courts for trial?\"\n\nThis sentence actually made Lu Ding laugh.\n\nHe'd seen stupid before.\n\nBut he had truly never seen stupidity this impressive.\n\n\"You manage ordinary people. I manage people like them. Ordinary people have their laws, and people like them have laws to restrain them, too. What I'm doing is legal and reasonable.\"\n\n\"But you didn't say it was compliant with regulations.\"\n\nYan Biexie had caught the loophole.\n\nLu Ding rolled his eyes at him. \"What's it to you? Don't push your luck. If you can't stop yourself from talking, just go to sleep for a bit. Listening to you is annoying.\"\n\n\"No, no, that's not what I meant. I just don't really get it, sorry. But I can't fall asleep either.\"\n\nHe didn't mean anything by it; he just didn't understand. A normal person's worldview and the education he'd received his whole life made it impossible to accept the current situation.\n\nLu Ding flicked a ball of Qi, striking one of Yan Biexie's acupoints. He watched as the man fell straight back, unconscious.\n\n\"Now you can sleep. Director Gao, you should have Tang Long and Tang Bao's contact information, right? Notify them to return here immediately to see me.\"\n\nThe reason Lu Ding wanted the other two to see him was to gauge their reactions.\n\nIf they reacted well, he would observe them a while longer. Although he very much wanted to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots, 749 didn't have a policy of collective punishment without reason, so he couldn't just kill the two of them for no good cause.\n\nBut if they reacted poorly, that would be exactly what he wanted.\n\nCut the weeds and eliminate the roots.\n\nThe three brothers could walk the Yellow Springs Road together.\n\nAs for whether the bureau would punish him for the deaths of Tang Hu and the other Qi Refiners?\n\nIt was just as Lu Ding himself had said, and as Yan Biexie had supplemented.\n\nReasonable, legal, but not compliant with regulations.\n\nHe would probably be interrogated and investigated, just like last time, but he likely wouldn't be punished.\n\nOne had to remember, Lu Ding had just resolved the Yin Domain overlap incident at the Dinghao Residential Complex. He had performed a great service; the only reason he hadn't received his reward yet was because the aftermath was still being handled.\n\nHow could the higher-ups punish a hero for something that was both justified, reasonable, and legal?\n\nAttacking a peacekeeper was a major crime in itself.\n\nLet alone torturing one.\n\nPeacekeepers don't manage Qi Refiners, but Qi Refiners cannot touch peacekeepers. That was the rule.\n\nOtherwise, if becoming a Qi Refiner meant you could casually defy the law and harm ordinary people and the peacekeepers who maintained order, wouldn't the world descend into chaos?!\n\nHearing Lu Ding's words, Gao Zhenglian gave up. He could see it now: this man was a lawless master. As long as he barely skirted 749's regulations for managing Qi Refiners, if you provoked him, he would kill you.\n\nNo hesitation whatsoever.\n\nAnd he himself was just an ordinary person.\n\nForget it, forget it.\n\n\"Fine, fine. Whatever you say goes, right?\" Gao Zhenglian took the opportunity to let out a small complaint.\n\nAfter spending this much time with him, Lu Ding had figured out Gao Zhenglian's temperament, just as Gao Zhenglian had figured out his.\n\nSpreading his hands with a helpless expression, Lu Ding said, \"Weren't you the one, Director Gao, who asked me to come help rescue them? As a 749 investigator, and the Enforcer of Baofan District, when I encounter something like this, it's my duty to intervene. What, are you dissatisfied?\"\n\n\"Even if I were, what could I do? I can't exactly piece them back together and say, 'Hey, hang in there, you'll be fine once you get to the hospital.' These guys need to be sent to the crematorium, and even then, they'll have to be burned behind closed doors.\"\n\nLu Ding was a little surprised. He really hadn't pegged Gao Zhenglian as someone who appreciated dark humor and gallows jokes.\n\nSoon.\n\nTang Long and Tang Bao met downstairs at the Five Viscera Society building.\n\nStaring at their headquarters before them.\n\nThe two brothers looked up together.\n\nTang Bao spoke first. \"Big Brother, Second Brother is probably gone. When we go up, don't be impulsive. Let me do all the talking. Follow my lead. Having lost Second Brother, I don't want to lose you too.\"\n\nCompared to Tang Hu's explosive temper and Tang Long's taciturn nature, the third brother, Tang Bao, was undoubtedly the smartest and most astute of the three.\n\nHe was the one who managed all the major and minor affairs of the Five Viscera Society.\n\nTang Hu's role was mainly to project their combat strength to the outside world and to handle situations that required physical force.\n\nTang Long, on the other hand, was their strongest fighter, responsible for quietly cultivating his skills. He was the ultimate foundation of the Five Viscera Society's power.\n\nOriginally, Tang Bao was supposed to be the one to purchase the ritual supplies that morning.\n\nHowever, Cao Ying from Cao Family Alley had called him over to discuss helping him establish a foothold in the Cao family.\n\nAs a result of this twist of fate, Tang Hu was sent to pick up the goods instead.\n\nHis carelessness led to the transaction being discovered by Yan Biexie and the other peacekeepers, which led to everything that followed.\n\nIt was also at Cao Ying's place that Tang Bao overheard people talking about what had happened at the Dinghao Residential Complex that night.\n\nA Yin Domain overlap, hordes of monsters, a ground paved with flesh and bone, rivers of blood.\n\nEach and every detail struck Tang Bao's heart like a hammer.\n\nAfter hearing all this, he had immediately made a decision: when he returned today, he would prepare things and personally bring his second brother, Tang Hu, to Lu Ding to carry thorns on his back and beg for forgiveness.¹\n\nAlthough he had told Gao Zhenglian to act as if he had never seen that message at the time, you can't be too careful.\n\nWhat if Gao Zhenglian didn't do him that favor? What if Lu Ding saw it and, once he had a free moment, remembered the matter? Wouldn't the Five Viscera Society be finished then? Having provoked such a killing star, there might not be a place for the three of them in Baofan District, or even in all of Yunhai City, in the future.\n\nBut in the end, who would have thought?\n\nBefore he could even go find Lu Ding, the man had come knocking on their door himself.\n\nAnd it was because of Second Brother again.\n\nWhen Tang Bao received this news, his vision instantly went black.\n\nAt the same time, he mentally prepared himself for his second brother's tragic death.\n\nAlthough he had never met Lu Ding, he had heard of him. Moreover, the man had just dealt with the Dinghao Residential Complex incident. Whether he was physically and mentally exhausted or not, he surely wanted to rest. And at this critical juncture, he had still come to attack the Five Viscera Society.\n\nThe question was, a person with such a temper and such exaggerated combat power, coming at a time like this—could the troublemaker Tang Hu possibly survive?\n\nTang Long was silent for a long time. \"If Second Brother is really dead, this grudge...\"\n\n\"Brother!\" Tang Bao cried out. \"I'm grieving too, but we can't afford to seek revenge for this, nor can we. We mustn't. Our Five Viscera Society has been too arrogant these past few years, so arrogant we've lost track of our own worth. It's not the first time Second Brother has caused trouble. I gave him face, you gave him support, and we've cleaned up countless messes for him.\"\n\n\"It's because he's my second brother!!\"\n\n\"What was our purpose in coming to Yunhai City? It was to give ourselves a better life, to make our parents proud, to make something of ourselves! Over the years, we've traded our dignity for money, and we've used money to buy back our dignity. But Second Brother only remembers the thrill of buying dignity with money and the unrestrained freedom that comes with power.\"\n\n\"He's forgotten the miserable state we were in when we traded our dignity for money! The Five Viscera Society is our life's blood, but what is Second Brother doing? He's pushing it, step by step, towards destruction!!!\"\n\n\"The world has rules! Lawlessness only leads to ruin! Brother, do you understand!?\"\n\nTang Long was finally moved.\n\n\"I understand. Let's go up.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\"\n\nTang Bao called out, turned, and retrieved a thorny branch from the car. This had originally been prepared for his second brother, Tang Hu, to use in his apology. Now, he could only use it himself.\n\nHe took off his shirt, and whipped his own back several times with the thorny branch. The thorns tore his skin, and blood trickled down.\n\nTang Bao's expression didn't change. \"Alright, let's go up.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  \"To carry thorns on one's back and beg for forgiveness\" (负荆请罪, fùjīng qǐngzuì) is a famous Chinese idiom originating from a historical event, signifying a sincere and humble apology where one is prepared to accept punishment.",

    "content": "......\n\nThe two brothers went upstairs, and even before they entered the room, the thick stench of blood assailed their nostrils.\n\nWalking in slowly with trepidation, they saw bits of flesh and blood scattered across the floor.\n\nIn the very center lay Tang Hu, split in two.\n\nGao Zhengliang shot them a helpless glance.\n\nAlthough Tang Hu had been a brainless fool, his overall impression of the Five Viscera Society wasn't particularly bad.\n\nEspecially Tang Bao.\n\nHe was very smart, understood the bigger picture, and had even helped the Bureau before.\n\nAside from that bit of unpleasantness last time, the two of them didn't really have any conflicts.\n\nOne was the director of the Baofan District Public Security Bureau, the other was the founder of the Five Viscera Society, a local powerhouse. One was an ordinary person, the other a Qi Refiner.\n\nThey had no conflicts of interest and were bound to cross paths. The world wasn't so full of irreconcilable grudges.\n\nTang Bao's and Tang Long's gazes fell upon Lu Ding, who was seated in the place of honor.\n\nThe man was just sitting there, yet it was as if a king occupied his throne, his entire being exuding an inexplicable, oppressive aura.\n\nThis feeling wasn't something Lu Ding projected intentionally. Rather, it was something Tang Long and Tang Bao's own subconscious minds attributed to him.\n\nFrom the bottom of their hearts, they were terrified of Lu Ding.\n\nHe was unpredictable. He followed rules, but only the rules of 749 and his own. And yet, he didn't follow the rules—not the rules of the outside world.\n\nLogically, someone like that shouldn't live long, but he was just too tough, his abilities too strong.\n\nHis growth had been rapid over a short period; his development was exceptionally fast. One moment of inattention, and you'd think he was behind you, but by the time you turned around, he'd left you so far in the dust you couldn't even see his taillights.\n\nOne could not afford to make an enemy of a man like this.\n\nTang Bao shot Gao Zhengliang a questioning glance.\n\nAll he got in return was a look of helplessness.\n\nHe understood in his heart that he would have to handle today's matter himself.\n\n*Thud!*\n\nStill a dozen or so steps away from Lu Ding, Tang Bao dropped straight to his knees.\n\nHis knees cracked the blood-soaked, slippery floorboards.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Enforcer Lu. My second brother was ignorant and caused trouble for you. Beatings, punishments, we will accept them. Please, show mercy and leave us a path to walk.\"\n\nBeside him, Tang Long knelt as well without a word.\n\nTang Bao's tone was sincere. With both hands, he raised a thorny switch above his head and offered it up.\n\nLu Ding: ........\n\nThis was getting tricky. Every one of them was so damn smart.\n\nIt left him no room to use this as a pretext to make an example of them.\n\n*Whatever. Tang Hu is already dead, Tang Bao and Tang Long aren't harboring any funny ideas, and their attitude is so sincere.*\n\nLu Ding spoke, neither hurried nor slow. \"From the first day I took this post until now, all this time, I've never once thought of making things difficult for you. As long as you obey the law, you live your life, I live mine, and we don't interfere with each other.\"\n\n\"It's expected that you give me face. It's also expected that I don't have to give you any.\"\n\n\"I've seen your attitude today, so we'll let this matter drop. Call it a threat or a warning, you'd best listen carefully and remember my words.\"\n\n\"I don't want something like this to happen a second time. As for the matter with the Zhenla Kingdom, you write up the paperwork, and I'll sign off. Just remember to pay your taxes!\"\n\nBased on recent events, Lu Ding guessed that this year's Ghost Festival would not be boring.\n\nBaofan District was too big; he probably couldn't handle it all on his own.\n\nBesides, it wasn't just this year that things could go wrong during the Ghost Festival. Every year, on days that flirted with the supernatural—the Ghost Festival, Qingming, the Double Ninth Festival, New Year's Eve, and so on—incidents would occur.\n\nIt was the same all over the country.\n\nWhen the time came, 749 wouldn't have enough manpower, and Lu Ding wouldn't be able to be everywhere at once. These local Qi Refiner factions could, more or less, be of some help.\n\nThis was also why 749 tolerated their existence.\n\nAs for ritual consumables.\n\nIt was pointless to scrutinize that matter too closely.\n\nThe so-called \"no trade, no killing\" principle applied here; the domestic demand was simply too large, and that would inevitably breed crime, among ordinary people and Qi Refiners alike.\n\nSo, shifting the demand overseas while having the taxes paid domestically—basically free money for 749 without them having to provide a thing—was actually a pretty good deal.\n\nIt stabilized his own position, increased revenue, and prevented trouble.\n\nHow great was that?\n\nHearing Lu Ding relent, Tang Bao let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nThe Five Viscera Society was saved, and the issue of ritual consumables was also resolved.\n\nIt seemed this \"Corpse-Butcher Fiend\" wasn't so unreasonable after all, at least not like the rumors made him out to be.\n\nHis current thoughts were exactly what Lu Ding needed.\n\nThis involved a bit of psychology.\n\nTo give a simple example: if a good man, who has been good his whole life, is one day forced to or unintentionally does something bad, people will judge him, saying he couldn't keep up the act and his true colors were finally showing.\n\nBut if a bad man, who has done bad things his whole life, one day can't bear to see something and, by pure chance, does a good deed, people will say he's not bad at heart, just a bit temperamental. They'll say, \"I think we can give him a chance,\" and many others will agree.\n\nThis is what comes from breaking a persona.\n\nIt's the contrast in character and action that leaves a deeper impression on people.\n\nIn the eyes of the two brothers, Lu Ding was just like that.\n\nHis nickname on the street was infamous, but not something one liked to hear.\n\nNow they had experienced it firsthand. And even though it had come at the cost of their brother's life, he could still think to himself:\n\n*Huh... this guy's not bad!!!*\n\n\"Thank you, Enforcer Lu!!!\"\n\nLu Ding rose. \"No need to thank me. We're just reaching a mutual understanding.\"\n\nHe walked past Tang Bao and headed outside.\n\nTang Bao turned his head slightly, watching the departing back.\n\nHis eyes filled with contemplation. He had seen many powerful men, and he had seen many geniuses, but he had never seen anyone quite like Lu Ding.\n\nSometimes, a person's charisma isn't limited to attracting the opposite sex, or even being liked. Rather, the word \"charisma\" arises from the interweaving of many positive emotions.\n\nFrom Lu Ding, Tang Bao experienced what it meant to have someone right before your eyes yet feel an unreachable distance, combined with the violent aesthetic created by the bloody and abrupt scene in the room.\n\n.....\n\nThe Yin Domain overlap at the Dinghao Residential Area, and the gruesome death of the Five Viscera Society's Tang Hu, with not even a bone left behind—two events sufficient to shake the entire Baofan District had occurred within the span of a single night and day.\n\nThe entire Baofan District was abuzz with talk.\n\nLu Ding rarely made public appearances, so outsiders didn't know much about him. After news of today's events spread, the people of Baofan District grew even more curious about their enforcer.\n\nCao Ying was one of those most interested in Lu Ding.\n\nUnlike the others, he had met Lu Ding before, though they hadn't spoken much and were merely nodding acquaintances.\n\nBut the feeling Lu Ding gave him was that of a kindred spirit on a different path. Their general directions were similar, but their goals were different.\n\nAnd now these two incidents had happened.\n\nCao Ying used the lid of his cup to skim the foam from his tea. He took a sip of the top-grade Houkui tea, personally picked and processed in the mountains by a Treasure Seeker,¹ and let out a \"tsk.\" He stared at his teacup, lost in thought.\n\nHis own life was like the tea leaves in this cup. Born of the secluded mountain forests, it had to endure high heat and scalding water—a mountain of swords and a sea of fire—to achieve its current flavor. But for him, this wasn't enough. It was far from enough. He wanted more.\n\nSuddenly, Cao Ying's eyes lit up.\n\n\"Of course! Instead of looking for these local small fry, why not go straight to Lu Ding? With his power and current reputation, as long as he supports me, who would dare challenge my, Cao Ying's, status in Cao Family Alley!?\"\n\n***\n\n> ¹**Treasure Seeker** (憋宝人, *biē bǎo rén*): A term from Chinese folklore for individuals who can sense and find hidden treasures, but are often bound by rules of secrecy.",

Add to that his own great skill and sharp mind, and you had the man he was today, with his current power and status.\n\nThis time, he had returned from the mountains.\n\nHe had two main objectives. One, to take back what was rightfully his. Two, to make Caojia Alley bigger and stronger, and to secure more stable profits.\n\nBut no matter which one, they both sounded simple but were much harder to execute.\n\nYears ago, he had chosen to leave Caojia Alley. From that moment on, although his name was still on the Cao family registry, the family had long since ceased to acknowledge him as one of their descendants.\n\nNow that he wanted to return, he would have to regain the Cao family's recognition.\n\nThe biggest obstacle in this was the second branch of the Cao family from his generation, the line of Cao Yuan, the current young master of the Cao family.\n\nHow could they possibly agree to let him return to burn incense for the ancestors and re-enter the ancestral hall?\n\nThat would just be asking for trouble.\n\nOriginally, Cao Ying had planned to rally the local forces in Baofan District, or other Qi Refiner factions in Yunhai, and combine them with his own crew to challenge Cao Yuan in an open contest.\n\nBut with the appearance of Lu Ding, and after learning about the forces backing Cao Yuan, Cao Ying suddenly had a realization.\n\nThe reason Cao Yuan was so formidable now, wasn't it just because he was relying on his big brother and his mom?\n\nOne was a veteran investigator from Bureau 749, who had previously disappeared and was presumed dead, only to make a powerful comeback after Cao Ying left.\n\nThe other had been abroad for over a decade and had recently returned to Yunhai with a foreign financial conglomerate in tow.\n\nThe two of them supported Cao Yuan with both influence and financial power.\n\nBut Cao Ying? Aside from himself, he had nothing. His dad didn't love him, his mom was dead. He was supposed to be from the main branch, but because he couldn't stand alone, he was forced to flee deep into the mountains and become a Treasure Hunter.\n\nNow, although he couldn't compare to Cao Yuan in terms of influence, he was not the least bit lacking in financial power.\n\nSo what if Cao Yuan had a mother with immense wealth?\n\n\"Your brother is awesome? Well, then I'll just find someone more awesome than your brother, won't I?\"\n\nHis eyes darted around as he mulled it over in his mind.\n\nIf only Lu Ding knew what he was thinking. If he did, Lu Ding would have shot back with a line of his own.\n\n*'Say no more. You give me the resources, I'll get the job done. I don't care if it's his brother or his dad—as long as you provide enough heavenly materials and earthly treasures, I can fend them off for you, even if the King of Heaven himself shows up.'*\n\nOf course, this was all on the premise that Cao Yuan's brother wasn't outrageously powerful.\n\nNight fell.\n\nIt was time for Lu Ding to be active again.\n\nAfter returning from the Five Viscera Life Society, he had slept comfortably until nine in the evening.\n\nHe got up, stretching with a yawn, and heard a continuous series of cracks and pops from all over his body.\n\nLu Ding subconsciously picked up his phone to unlock it and take a look, only to see a message from the Bureau 749 app that had arrived earlier in the evening.\n\nIt stated that the cleanup work for the Dinghao Community was complete. Because he had handled the matter of the Overlapping Yin Domain so cleanly and efficiently, preventing the risk of large-scale casualties among ordinary citizens, the higher-ups had decided to award him one hundred and fifty contribution points and a cash reward of two million.\n\nThis was undoubtedly fantastic news for Lu Ding.\n\nThe money wasn't a big deal; he still had plenty on hand. The main thing was the contribution points.\n\nWith this one hundred and fifty, plus what he had before, Lu Ding now had over two hundred. He could finally exchange them for heavenly materials and earthly treasures. With the Ghost Festival¹ fast approaching, Lu Ding had to hurry and increase his strength to face any unexpected events.\n\nHe opened the exchange tab on the 749 app.\n\nThe dazzling array of all kinds of heavenly materials and earthly treasures was truly overwhelming.\n\n【Disemboweled Buddha Sprout】\n【Price: Eighty contribution points per portion】\n【A stone Buddha gained sentience, cultivating its stone into flesh, capable of nurturing life force. Can be used to awaken the spirit and open the orifices, or to concentrate medicinal power to expand the spiritual sea.】\n\nGot the points. Bought it. Might as well give it a try and see what it's all about.\n\n【Spiritfall Sand】\n【Price: Seventy contribution points per portion】\n【A specialty product of a Cloud-Devouring Feng Shui Formation. Can be used externally to strengthen the physical body, or consumed internally to expand the spiritual sea.】\n\nGot the points. Bought it. Might as well give it a try and see what it's all about.\n\n【Full Moon Dew】\n【Price: Eighty contribution points per portion】\n【Essence of the full moon collected via a secret method. Can cleanse the soul. Its main function is to expand the spiritual sea.】\n\nHe glanced at his balance. Not much left, but still enough. Lu Ding gritted his teeth—better to spend it than to hoard it. Bought it. Might as well give it a try and see what it's all about.\n\nAs he pressed \"confirm payment,\" Lu Ding's balance was instantly wiped clean.\n\nThe pain was real. This was his hard-earned money, and now it was all gone in one go. The ten points from joining 749, plus twenty from Old Lady Hei, fifty from the Fire-Molted Living Corpse, and one hundred and fifty from the Overlapping Yin Domain—a total of two hundred and thirty, all gone!\n\n\"I hope the effects don't disappoint me!\"\n\nSoon, a special courier from 749 delivered a cardboard box.\n\nOpening the box, he found one smaller box and two bottles inside, none of them large.\n\nThe box contained the Disemboweled Buddha Sprout. He opened it and saw no more than ten pieces in total, about the size of Zhu Ye Qing tea leaves and looking quite similar, except their color was a dark gold. There was no fragrance, nor any golden light.\n\nIt looked completely unremarkable.\n\nAs for the Full Moon Dew and Spiritfall Sand, one was a silvery-white, viscous liquid emitting a faint, jasmine-like fragrance, while the other was light-yellow sand that smelled of roasted chestnuts. Together, they probably amounted to about two hundred milliliters.\n\nThis...\n\n\"This is way too little!!\"\n\nThere was so little that Lu Ding felt like his contribution points had been thrown down the drain. So little that he didn't even know how he was supposed to consume it.\n\nHe looked around.\n\nGrabbing a teacup in the room that he had never used, Lu Ding first poured in the Full Moon Dew and the Spiritfall Sand. He stirred them together. There was no reaction; it was just like mixing cement at a construction site.\n\nIt wasn't until he tossed the Disemboweled Buddha Sprout in that the cup began to bubble, with white foam constantly churning.\n\nLu Ding frowned and quickly dialed the operator's line.\n\nHe asked, sounding very uncertain, \"The Disemboweled Buddha Sprout, Spiritfall Sand, and Full Moon Dew—can these three be taken together?\"\n\nThe person on the other end answered without a hint of hesitation: \"Yes, they can. As long as there are no special notes, all heavenly materials and earthly treasures can be mixed and used together.\"\n\nAlthough that's what they said, Lu Ding still felt a little hesitant and uncertain as he looked at the foaming cup.\n\nForget it.\n\nHe hung up the phone and downed it in one go.\n\nA torrential medicinal power instantly exploded within Lu Ding's body, surging through his limbs and meridians, rushing straight for his spiritual sea. A thunderous rumble sounded as the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was drawn in, mixing with the medicinal power to carry out a drastic overhaul of Lu Ding's spiritual sea.\n\nAs the area of his spiritual sea and the quality of his spiritual fluid improved, Lu Ding's cultivation realm also began to climb rapidly.\n\nA day passed in the blink of an eye.\n\nOver here, Lu Ding was still cultivating.\n\nOn the other side, the people from Great Black Mountain had finally arrived.\n\nFour Seas Group, branch office.\n\nJie Shunan was sitting in her office wearing gloves, toying with a jade gourd that was simple in design but of excellent quality.\n\nAfter the incident with Ye Xuan and the old man surnamed Huang, she had been searching for a gift to give Lu Ding as an apology, a show of sincerity from the Four Seas Group.\n\nFinally, her hard work paid off, and Jie Shunan managed to buy this Sha-Nurturing Gourd.\n\nShe had just received it today.\n\nShe hadn't even had a chance to examine the gourd's miraculous properties yet.\n\nThe office door was violently thrown open, and several figures with powerful auras stormed in.\n\n\"Well, well, a Sha-Nurturing Gourd. You've got some nice things here, huh?\"\n\nThe young man raised his hand, and a powerful suction force instantly ripped the gourd from Jie Shunan's grasp.\n\nHer expression turned grave as she stood up. \"Dragon Claw Hand?\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Ghost Festival:** Refers to the Zhongyuan Festival or Hungry Ghost Festival, a traditional Taoist and Buddhist festival held in some East Asian countries. It is believed that on this day, the gates of the underworld are opened and ghosts are free to roam the earth.",

    "content": ".....\n\nThe young man rubbed the gourd, feeling its texture, and turned his head. \"You've got a good eye, Miss Xie, to actually recognize the Dragon Claw Hand. Since you recognize it, you should recognize me, right?\"\n\nXie Shunan looked at the young man—thin, with sunken cheeks, but whose eyes shone with a sharp light—and an answer had already formed in her heart.\n\nBut what came out of her mouth was, \"I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. This isn't something you should have. Give it back to me.\"\n\nThe young man froze for a moment, genuinely not expecting Xie Shunan to play dumb with him.\n\n\"If you don't know me, then let's get acquainted. My name is Ye Feng, from Great Black Mountain. Ye Xuan was my cousin. As for whether I should have this gourd?\"\n\n\"My cousin Ye Xuan and an elder from my village both died in Yunhai, on the territory of your Four Seas Group. Never mind a Malevolence-Nurturing Gourd; even if I took *you*, no one would dare say I was wrong.\"\n\nAs Ye Feng spoke, he toyed with the Malevolence-Nurturing Gourd and walked forward.\n\nXie Shunan regarded him with indifference. \"Since when did the people of Great Black Mountain get so brazen? Do you really think now is like the old days?\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, the people of Great Black Mountain have always been this brazen. Don't think that just because your Four Seas Group's business has grown, you can walk all over Great Black Mountain. Let me put it this way: this time, the other three families of your Four Seas Group have given us an explanation. Only your Xie family has delayed in showing its attitude.\"\n\n\"So tell me, what should be done about this?\"\n\n\"An explanation? What explanation do I owe you? Whether it was Ye Xuan or Elder Huang, they were both killed by Lu Ding. If you have the guts, go find him.\"\n\nArrogant!\n\nSo what if he was arrogant?\n\nXie Shunan had seen far more arrogant people. Take Tang Hu, for instance. He was even more arrogant—lawless, domineering, and the local tyrant of Baofan District. And what was the result? He didn't even die in one piece; he couldn't be put back together.\n\nThe sole reason for it all was that he was courting death by provoking Lu Ding.\n\nAnd now here was another arrogant one.\n\nXie Shunan felt as if she could already foresee his end.\n\nYe Feng's smile faded slightly. \"Yes, that Lu Ding is indeed formidable, and he's backed by the 749. But I'm not afraid of him. I'm only wary of the 749 and can't afford to provoke it. If he weren't relying on the 749, I'd go kill him right now.\"\n\nAt this, Ye Feng's eyes scanned Xie Shunan from top to bottom. \"And don't you go thinking about killing with a borrowed knife. I'll tell you straight: I won't be looking for trouble with him for the time being. The man died right under your nose, Miss Xie. I'm here to make trouble for your Xie family. One must pick the softest persimmon to pinch, and I'm set on pinching you, you soft persimmon!\"\n\nHe held up three fingers. \"Three days. I'll give you just three days. Think it over yourself or discuss it with your father. After three days, I want to see your Xie family's attitude. If I don't, then the Four Seas Group will become the Three Seas Group. Don't you dare doubt my words. I am from Great Black Mountain, understand, Miss Xie?\"\n\n\"I'll take this Malevolence-Nurturing Gourd as interest. If you've made up your mind, come find me at Cao Family Alley.\"\n\nWatching Ye Feng's departing figure, Xie Shunan remained silent for a long time before slowly sitting down. Although she didn't know the exact situation, if the other three families of the Four Seas Group had sided with Ye Feng, then his words were no joke.\n\nHe could genuinely make the Four Seas Group become the Three Seas Group.\n\n\"Disintegration usually starts from within.\" Xie Shunan found it somewhat ironic.\n\nThe older generation 'might' not do such a thing, but the successors of the other three families were another story.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the other three families were willing to give Great Black Mountain an answer also indicated that their elders tacitly approved of Great Black Mountain's actions.\n\nTragic, truly tragic.\n\nShe pulled open the drawer in front of her and took out a recording pen.\n\nThen she looked toward the hidden camera on the bookshelf.\n\nWith a mocking expression, she said, \"Country bumpkin. What era is this to still be making threats? You took Lu Ding's things and your words are filled with hints of wanting to oppose him. Go tell him yourself.\"\n\nXie Shunan immediately sent the video and audio files, completely unedited, to Gao Zhengliang, asking him to forward them to Lu Ding and to have Lu Ding contact her after watching the video.\n\n........\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nLooking at his second-level Spirit Sea realm and the ridiculously large Spirit Sea, Lu Ding once again fell into doubt.\n\n\"I remember that a normal second-level Spirit Sea shouldn't be this large...\"\n\nAt the first level of the Spirit Sea Realm, the Spirit Sea was the size of a puddle. That was correct; his own Spirit Sea had been that big at the start.\n\nWith each subsequent level increase, the Spirit Sea would expand from its original base according to one's talent, physical body, and the natural treasures used. The expansion could range from a minimum of double to a maximum of tenfold—this was knowledge accumulated over countless years.\n\nYet Lu Ding's second-level Spirit Sea was dozens of times larger than his first-level one.\n\nThis strange situation made Lu Ding fall deep into thought.\n\n\"The natural treasures I used were all good, but they shouldn't be so good as to shatter common understanding...\"\n\nThen the problem wasn't with the natural treasures.\n\nAs for the cultivation method...\n\nIf the method comprehended from the Flying Bear Visualization Diagram had such an effect, it would have been absolutely impossible for him to ever get his hands on the Flying Bear Visualization Diagram.\n\nAnd so far, the cultivation method he had comprehended from the Flying Bear Visualization Diagram had shown no such miraculous properties.\n\nSo it wasn't the cultivation method's fault either.\n\nThat left himself!\n\nBut looking over his golden finger, among the things Lu Ding had obtained from it, besides \"Forgetting Form,\" which could manually activate the state of Unity of Heaven and Man to assist cultivation, there were no other skills that could help with cultivation.\n\n\"Could it be because of the Unity of Heaven and Man?\"\n\nLu Ding opened the 749 App and began searching related documents and forums.\n\nAfter some searching, a few pages of documentation indeed caught his attention.\n\n【Nobody said expanding the Spirit Sea would be this painful!!!】\n\nThe moment Lu Ding saw this title, he was completely bewildered.\n\nPainful? It wasn't painful at all.\n\n【I really need to read more in the future. Some time ago, I went into seclusion to break through to the second level of the Spirit Sea. I thought it would be like the Zhaoxuan Realm, where my cultivation would progress naturally and I'd just break through a small bottleneck to reach the next minor realm. Who knew that after using the natural treasures, it would be agonizingly painful, like my body was being torn apart......... A final word of advice to all colleagues preparing to break through a minor realm in the Spirit Sea: you must be mentally prepared. This is all from experience!!!!】\n\nReplies in the comments below:\n\n【Hahahahaha, another one fell for it. I'm dying of laughter. I was going to post about this issue myself back then, but since no one else was saying anything, I didn't either. Let's all suffer together.】\n\n【You're already crying out in pain at the second level of the Spirit Sea? Let me tell you, it gets more painful the further you go. There have even been people who were too scared of the pain to break through to higher realms.】\n\n【You've read novels, right? You know how cultivators in novels have to endure a thunder tribulation to break through a realm? That's right, the pain endured while expanding the Spirit Sea is the tribulation we Qi Refiners in the real world have to pass.】\n\n【Cultivation is inherently an act of going against the heavens. The natural law is natural growth; cultivation is a kind of mutated development, an unnatural growth. Of course you'll endure pain, especially in the Spirit Sea Realm, which is known as the second great watershed.】\n\n【There are painless breakthroughs, but that's a kind of opportunity not available to ordinary people. You know about the Unity of Heaven and Man? As long as you happen to enter that state while breaking through, you won't feel any pain.】\n\n【The state of Unity of Heaven and Man is something that can be chanced upon but not sought, let alone having it happen at the exact moment of a breakthrough.】",

    "title": "Chapter 52 Tomorrow? Today, let’s kill Ye Feng now!",
    "content": "......\n\nThese comments echoed what was said in the literature.\n\nAccording to the texts, the so-called \"Unity of Heaven and Man\" represented a person's integration with nature, with all of heaven and earth.\n\nAs long as you could enter the state of Unity of Heaven and Man, it meant you were favored by the Dao.\n\nThe bottlenecks and the pain of expanding one's spirit sea were all limitations the Dao placed on Qi Refiners.\n\nThe very act of refining qi was creating something from nothing, an unequal conversion that ran contrary to the natural course of human growth.\n\nBut because \"the Great Dao has forty-nine aspects, and one has fled,\" that one represented life and infinite possibility. It was why ordinary people could become Qi Refiners, and why Qi Refiners could continue to cultivate and ascend.\n\nBut they needed to overcome numerous obstacles.\n\nThese obstacles could also be explained by the saying, \"the Great Dao has forty-nine aspects, and one has fled.\"\n\nThis \"one\" was the Dao's favor, a back door, a loophole that could be exploited—and it had no side effects.\n\nTo be precise, this favor, this loophole, was the Unity of Heaven and Man. Later generations of Qi Refiners could understand it as Old Man Heaven helping you cultivate, giving you a hand.\n\n\"Old Man Heaven gave me a hand...\"\n\nLu Ding thought of his own \"State of Formlessness,\"¹ and he couldn't quite suppress the smile on his lips.\n\nFrom the moment he became a Qi Refiner until now, Old Man Heaven had probably given him more than just a hand.\n\nIt was practically carrying him up the ladder.\n\nOld Man Heaven was chasing him around to spoon-feed him. How could he complain?\n\n\"I wasn't wrong to call you Old Man Heaven. You really are my grandpa.\"\n\nBOOM!!!!!!!\n\nA sudden clap of thunder on a clear day startled Lu Ding so badly he instinctively snapped into a parry,² shuddering for no reason.\n\nHe took two steps to the window and looked up at the sky.\n\n\"It's probably just a coincidence.\"\n\n*Forget it, forget it, can't think about it anymore.* Whether it was a coincidence or not, Lu Ding hurriedly shook the whimsical thoughts from his mind.\n\nHe got up, dressed, and decided he needed to do something to distract himself. It was only then that he noticed it.\n\nFaint-Signal,³ an app he rarely used, actually had a notification today.\n\nHe opened it. It was from Gao Zhengliang, whom he had added earlier.\n\nHe had sent a video and an audio clip.\n\nBelow it was a single line of text.\n\n\"Xie Shunan asked me to send this to you. She also said to contact her after you've seen it.\"\n\nLu Ding opened the video and audio, watching and listening to the entire thing. The gentleness in his eyes gradually faded.\n\n\"If it weren't for my backing from 749, you'd kill me on the spot?\"\n\nHe had transmigrated almost twenty years ago, and this was the first time he had ever heard someone say they were going to kill him.\n\n\"Ye Feng of Great Black Mountain...\"\n\nVery good. He'd remember that name.\n\nAs for why Xie Shunan had sent this video and audio clip to Lu Ding...\n\nHer motive was easy enough to understand. It was nothing more than seeking help, or cooperation, or perhaps a show of her stance.\n\nIf she had wanted to kill with a borrowed knife, she wouldn't have sent the complete, unedited files.\n\n\"This woman is certainly clever,\" Lu Ding commented.\n\nYe Feng's existence was, to some extent, a threat to Lu Ding. While it might not lead to any serious consequences, it was like a toad squatting on your instep. It doesn't bite, but it's disgusting.\n\nWho knew if one day the man might suddenly have a brain fart and cause some trouble.\n\nAfter all, the future was uncontrollable.\n\nAnd Lu Ding didn't like the feeling of a time bomb that could go off at any moment.\n\nWhat he wanted was for every situation to be completely within his grasp.\n\nTomorrow...\n\nOh, no!\n\nToday. Right now. Lu Ding decided he was going to Cao Family Alley to kill Ye Feng!!!\n\nHe would smother any and all threats in the cradle.\n\nAs for Great Black Mountain...\n\nHe didn't have time for that now. He didn't yet possess that level of overwhelming strength. He'd deal with it later. Once he had enough free time and his power had reached the necessary level, Lu Ding decided he would pay a visit to Great Black Mountain.\n\nNot for any other reason.\n\nHe had only one objective: to wipe out the bandits on Great Black Mountain!!\n\nHe stood up.\n\nPushing the door open, he walked out. Yan Feifan, who lived next door, heard the movement from Lu Ding's room and hurried out as well.\n\n\"Brother Lu!\" he called out to Lu Ding's back.\n\nThe aura of a Zhaoxuan Realm cultivator was on full display.\n\nLu Ding looked at him. \"You broke through?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I broke through. I'm a Zhaoxuan Realm powerhouse now, too.\"\n\nThat's right, a Zhaoxuan Realm powerhouse. Even as he said it, Yan Feifan sounded a little lacking in confidence.\n\nLooking at Lu Ding now was like gazing into an abyss—bottomless, unfathomable.\n\nBefore he had entered the Zhaoxuan Realm, his senses hadn't been as sharp. Seeing Lu Ding was like viewing a mountain through a window; he could only see the scenery. Now that he had broken through, looking at Lu Ding was like truly stepping into the mountain itself.\n\nHe could begin to feel a preliminary sense of his terror.\n\n\"Very good. A Zhaoxuan Realm powerhouse. From now on, our Baofan District will be counting on you,\" Lu Ding said teasingly.\n\nYan Feifan quickly asked, \"Brother Lu, where are you headed?\"\n\n\"After I woke up, I heard all about your glorious achievements during this time. That was seriously awesome!!!\"\n\n\"Fighting a bloody battle in the Yin Domain, slaughtering Tang Hu... now your title, the 'Corpse-Dismantling Taisui,' makes a sound even when it drops.\"\n\n\"What kind of sound?\" Lu Ding asked, playing along.\n\nYan Feifan gave a thumbs-up. \"A real resounding clang.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahaha...\"\n\n\"Alright, stop goofing around. Since you're awake, come with me on a mission.\"\n\n\"A mission?\"\n\nYan Feifan was a little confused. He hadn't received any messages or notifications.\n\n\"Someone is plotting to assassinate a 749 investigator. We must go and nip this criminal element in the bud.\"\n\nHearing this, his expression instantly turned serious.\n\nHe asked in a grave tone, \"Who is the criminal trying to kill!?\"\n\nLu Ding pointed to himself. \"Me.\"\n\n\"Huh?! Wait, huh???\"\n\nIn that moment, the expression on Yan Feifan's face was truly a sight to behold.\n\n\"Is this guy nuts? Does he have a death wish?\"\n\nAs the two walked out, Lu Ding took out his phone and showed him the audio and video.\n\nAfter Yan Feifan finished, he said only two words.\n\n\"Get him!\"\n\nVROOOM!!!!\n\nThe accelerator was stomped, and the black SUV roared as it shot out of the Baofan District Public Security Bureau.\n\nIn the car.\n\nLu Ding sat in the passenger seat, swiping his phone screen. In the chat interface, Gao Zhengliang had sent Xie Shunan's contact information.\n\nHe tapped the dial button.\n\nAfter a few rings, the other end picked up.\n\nLu Ding got straight to the point. \"This is Lu Ding. I've seen your video and audio. I have some time now. Say what you need to say, but no nonsense. I don't have much time.\"\n\n\"Patrol Leader Lu, it's like this. Do you have a moment? I can come find you right now. The situation is a bit complicated. I think it would be better if we talked in person?\"\n\n\"Talk in person? Fine. Go wait for me in Cao Family Alley. I'm on my way there now. We'll meet in Cao Family Alley later.\"\n\nHearing this, Xie Shunan's brow furrowed so tightly it almost disappeared into her hairline.\n\nAfter a long silence, she finally spoke. \"Alright!\"\n\nAs soon as the call ended, Xie Shunan felt like her head was about to explode.\n\nShe had prepared herself for every possibility, including but not limited to: Lu Ding threatening her, Lu Ding flying into a rage and accusing her of trying to kill with a borrowed knife, Lu Ding making an outrageous demand to take advantage of the situation, and so on. She also knew that Lu Ding would definitely go looking for trouble with Ye Feng.\n\nBut she never thought it would be this fast!\n\nHe's going to storm Cao Family Alley right now?!\n\nHold on, shouldn't you at least prepare a little?\n\nThis isn't just about you and Ye Feng, I'm involved in this too! You're just going to completely ignore my opinion and whether or not I stand to benefit, and go straight to killing Ye Feng!!?\n\n\"He's insane. This whole world is insane. The man's a lunatic.\"\n\n\"Someone, get the car ready for me!!!\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **State of Formlessness (忘形之謂 wàng xíng zhī wèi):** A state of deep immersion where one acts effortlessly and instinctively, a manifestation of the \"Unity of Heaven and Man.\"\n2.  **Snapped into a parry (振刀 zhèn dāo):** An instantaneous defensive maneuver, likely referencing a counter-attack move from video games.\n3.  **Faint-Signal (弱信 ruòxìn):** A fictional messaging app, likely a play on the real-world app WeChat (微信 Wēixìn).",

    "title": "Chapter 53 King Gu is pointing Mao, Brother Ru is Ye Feng!",
    "content": "Night and dawn were when Caojia Alley truly revealed its true colors.\n\nMany things couldn't see the light of day, so they could only be done before dawn.\n\nCaojia Alley's Dark Street at night was bustling with people coming and going, with an incessant stream of hawking.\n\nJing Dynasty porcelain, Yu Dynasty bowls, Shangyuan treasured swords, Kaiming knives—everything one could wish for, nothing was missing.\n\nAside from these.\n\nThere were also street vendors, medicine sellers, and old men on street corners pulling you to watch a show.\n\nTsk.\n\nAll sorts of things, all walks of life and sundry—rare items and strange people you could imagine were here, and things you couldn't imagine were here too.\n\nThis was Caojia Alley's Dark Street.\n\nYe Feng walked among the crowd, his eyes full of wonder. Beside him followed a refined and amiable young man, dressed in a white long gown, with a palm-sized emerald jade pendant carved with a fish transforming into a dragon, tied with a golden thread, hanging from his waist. He walked with a stately gait, twirling a sandalwood fan in his hand.\n\nWho else in Caojia Alley could command such presence, other than Cao Yuan, the Young Head of the contemporary Caojia Alley?\n\n\"Brother Ye, how do you like my Caojia Alley?\"\n\nYe Feng couldn't help but nod, praising what he had seen along the way.\n\n\"This place is really good. No wonder the old geezers on the mountain all say your Caojia Alley is a golden goose*. Speaking of which, I think we could cooperate. How about I spread my Dahei Mountain goods to be sold in your Caojia Alley?\"\n\nCao Yuan had been waiting for this. Now that Ye Feng had made it clear, he seemed rather nonchalant.\n\n\"I can save a stall for you, but as for cooperation, you know, although I am the contemporary Young Head of the Cao family, many matters still require my family's oversight and support. I actually don't have that much authority.\"\n\nYe Feng suddenly turned around: \"Young Head, that's not honorable of you to say.\"\n\nA single stall versus a partnership—which was more important, which was more profitable? Even a fool could understand that.\n\nYe Feng had traveled all this way not just for Ye Xuan's matter.\n\nHe was older than Ye Xuan; perhaps his talent wasn't as good as Ye Xuan's, but his current strength was higher than Ye Xuan's, and he was also more cunning, though not by much.\n\n\"Hey, don't rush, let me finish.\"\n\nCao Yuan closed his folding fan and lightly tapped it on Ye Feng's shoulder: \"Didn't you come down from Dahei Mountain this time specifically to find trouble with the Xie family? Coincidentally, I'm also interested in external business. My mother just returned from abroad with a large sum of money, wanting to do some business in Yunhai.\"\n\n\"But for distant places, we can't get involved. And in the nearby Baofan District, all the business belongs to Four Seas Group. If you can take down the Xie family and transfer their share to me, then as for cooperation, whatever you say, that's what we'll do.\"\n\nAlthough Ye Feng's mind couldn't keep up with Cao Yuan's, he wouldn't rashly agree to this matter.\n\nIf the Xie family of Four Seas Group fell, the market share and equity were tangible money he could see right away.\n\nBut if it were divided with Cao Yuan.\n\nWhile it might yield several, even dozens, or scores of times the returns in the future, that would take time, wouldn't it? And it wouldn't be 100% guaranteed either.\n\nHe needed to think it over carefully.\n\nAround this time.\n\nLu Ding arrived at the entrance of Caojia Alley.\n\nThe car stopped, people got out, and a respectful security guard approached: \"Hello, sirs, do you have tickets? There's an event going on inside.\"\n\nThey were quite formal about it.\n\nLu Ding took out his Bureau 749 ID and handed it over: \"Ticket, here.\"\n\nSecurity Guard: ......\n\nFor some reason, though the words \"National Security\" were clearly written on it, the more he looked, the more it resembled a ticket.\n\nHmm!\n\nThat's right!\n\nIt's a ticket.\n\nStepping aside, he extended an arm: \"Please enter.\"\n\nLu Ding stood still: \"Why are you just standing there? Go report it! Tell your people inside to report upwards that Lu Ding has arrived, and tell your Young Head to come out and see me.\"\n\nHow big Caojia Alley was, Lu Ding didn't know, nor did he want to know. He only knew that it would be truly unwise to just barge in and search for someone.\n\nRather than actively searching.\n\nIt was better to directly tell Cao Yuan to hand over the person.\n\nAnyway, since Ye Feng had entered Caojia Alley, Lu Ding only recognized this principle.\n\nWhen you arrive somewhere, it's always right to find the local bigwig^2^.\n\nHe was now conducting an investigation. It wasn't too much to ask for cooperation from those within the jurisdiction, was it?\n\nOn the other side.\n\nCao Yuan received a report from his subordinate, stating that Lu Ding had arrived.\n\nHe was suspicious. Previously, when he invited this Corpse-Dissecting Tai Sui^3^ for a meal, Lu Ding was too busy killing Ye Xuan to attend. Now, Ye Feng had just arrived, and Lu Ding followed shortly after...\n\nHe glanced at Ye Feng, muttering to himself, \"How is this Ye fellow Lu Ding's bait?\"\n\nFor a moment, he began to weigh his options.\n\nHe understood that Lu Ding's arrival was entirely for Ye Feng.\n\n\"Logically speaking, Ye Feng didn't say he was going to find trouble with him, so he shouldn't do anything to Ye Feng, right...?\"\n\n\"Probably not.\"\n\n\"Besides, this is Caojia Alley. Even if he wanted to do something, he'd at least have some reservations.\"\n\nCao Yuan didn't want to offend Lu Ding, nor did he want to give up on Ye Feng.\n\nHe wanted to have his cake and eat it too^4^.\n\nCao Yuan mentally prepared himself to be a peacemaker.\n\nAt the same time, he made a backup plan, sending a message to his elder brother, who worked at Bureau 749.\n\nHis brother told him that he was currently on an urgent mission out of town and couldn't leave, but he would call his Spirit Sea Realm^5^ friend, also an official investigator from Bureau 749, to come and monitor the situation, just in case Lu Ding went crazy.\n\nAfter all, he didn't play by the rules; everyone in Yunhai knew that.\n\nWith his elder brother's assurance and a Spirit Sea Realm investigator from Bureau 749 stationed there.\n\nCao Yuan felt this situation was stable.\n\nHe immediately straightened out some non-existent wrinkles on his clothes.\n\n\"Brother Ye, I have a distinguished guest arriving. Do you want to browse around by yourself, or come with me?\"\n\n\"Distinguished guest? How distinguished?\"\n\n\"The Chief Enforcer of Baofan District, Bureau 749's intern investigator, Lu Ding Lu Tai Sui, nicknamed the Corpse-Dissecting Tai Sui—do you think he's distinguished?\"\n\nYe Feng's face instantly turned cold.\n\nHis mind churned with thoughts: Damn it, he didn't wait for Xie Shunan, but Lu Ding came instead!\n\nHow could he be here?\n\nThis madman, he won't make a move on me, will he?\n\nBut I didn't seek trouble with him, or offend him anywhere.\n\nSeeing him unable to utter a word for a long time, Cao Yuan comforted him: \"It's fine, this is Caojia Alley, he won't make a move on you. Don't be so timid; you came down from Dahei Mountain, so cheer up a bit. My brother said he would call his Spirit Sea Realm friend, also an official investigator from Bureau 749, to come and monitor the situation, to prevent this Corpse-Dissecting Tai Sui from displaying his craft.\"\n\nIt was a mix of slighting and reassurance.\n\nEven if Ye Feng was having doubts deep down, at this point, he couldn't say \"no.\"\n\nHe would lose face!\n\n\"I'll go then, it's just Lu Ding, isn't it? I don't believe he has three heads and six arms^6^. It's fine to meet him.\"\n\nHe said this for Cao Yuan's benefit, but also for his own, as a form of self-comfort.\n\nThe two walked together towards the entrance of Caojia Alley.\n\nAs soon as they appeared.\n\nThe security guard nearby, as if seeking credit, said: \"Officer, that's our Young Head.\"\n\nYan Feifan was also very quick-witted, taking out his phone and holding it up to compare the person next to Cao Yuan.\n\nThe next moment.\n\nHe extended his finger, pointing at Ye Feng as if King Yama were calling the roll^7^.\n\n\"That's right, it's him!

    "content": "At these words, Ye Feng's face changed in an instant.\n\nWhat did he mean?\n\nA kill on the spot?\n\nYou're for real?!\n\nA slashing attack arrived in a flash.\n\nHe scrambled to dodge, but not quickly enough. One of his ears hit the ground, spraying blood everywhere. Gritting his teeth in pain, Ye Feng scrambled behind Cao Yuan.\n\nNo one present had expected Lu Ding to lash out so violently in such a public setting.\n\nCao Yuan was just about to say something.\n\nLu Ding beat him to it.\n\n\"Ye Feng, you conspired to murder a 749 investigator. You're coming with me!!!\"\n\nYe Feng himself was stunned to hear this.\n\nHow come he didn't know he had such guts?\n\nForget him, not even his elders back on Black Wind Mountain had the nerve to murder a 749 investigator.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, a challenge to the authority of the Great Han.\n\n\"Bullshit! Who did I try to murder? Don't you try to frame me, Lu!¹ You say I intended to murder a 749 investigator—who? Show me the proof!\"\n\n\"That's right, Patrol Leader Lu. You need evidence to back up your words and actions. You may be the Baofan District Patrol Leader, but you can't just arrest whoever you please,\" Cao Yuan chimed in.\n\nLu Ding glanced at him. \"And who the hell do you think you are?\"\n\n\"Since when does 749 need outsiders supervising its work? Asking me for evidence? First, ask yourselves if you're even qualified. If you have a problem, go file a complaint against me at the Bureau. I'll be waiting!!!\"\n\n\"I am now arresting a suspect. Anyone who dares to interfere will be considered an accomplice and charged with violently resisting arrest. Now, get the hell out of my way!!!\"\n\nAs Lu Ding's aura flared, it shook the surroundings, sending dust and stones flying.\n\nThe calm darkness began to roil, as if something utterly terrifying was about to crawl out from within.\n\nAt that moment, his presence was made tangible.\n\nLu Ding's figure flashed. When he reappeared, he was already in front of Ye Feng and Cao Yuan. He leaped and raised his hand, and behind him, the shadow of a Flying Bear mirrored his every move. The terrifying bear lifted a thick palm larger than a man, ready to strike down.\n\nHe opened with a killing move!!!\n\nHe was even using his Natal Art. Just how deep was this grudge?\n\nA thought flashed through Cao Yuan's mind. Facing such a torrential display of power, he no longer dared to stand his ground.\n\nHe knew that if he didn't dodge today, this single move from Lu Ding would be enough to smash him and Ye Feng to death together—the kind where they'd be mashed into a single pile of meat paste, with bits of him in you and bits of you in him.\n\nCao Yuan ducked and rolled out of the way.\n\nHe had some skill, to be sure, but Ye Feng wasn't so lucky.\n\nThe palm struck his chest.\n\nTwo cracking sounds rang out, one after the other.\n\nThe first to shatter was the Sha-Nurturing Gourd he had stolen from Jie Shunan. The second was the Longevity Lock, a life-saving amulet given to him by his elders.\n\nBut even with two protective treasures, the blow still caved in half of Ye Feng's chest.\n\nWith a loud *boom*, his entire body smashed into the wall.\n\nHe sent a shower of broken bricks to the ground. Looking at him now, he lay in the rubble, his breaths shallow and ragged, looking half-dead. He was grievously wounded to the extreme and barely hanging on by a thread.\n\nYe Feng couldn't understand it at all.\n\nWhether it was the Sha-Nurturing Gourd or the Longevity Lock, they were both top-tier protective treasures! Otherwise, he wouldn't have been tempted enough to snatch the gourd from Jie Shunan in the first place, nor would he have worn the Longevity Lock for protection.\n\nHow could they have possibly shattered!!!?\n\nSuch terrifying power... was he even human?\n\nHe considered himself a genius, but before Lu Ding, how could he be so easily crushed!!?\n\nFrustration, indignation, terror, confusion—a whirlwind of emotions churned within him.\n\nUntil the bricks covering his face were brushed aside.\n\nHe once again saw that terrifying face.\n\nYe Feng used what little strength he had left to kick his legs and push himself backward.\n\n\"It wasn't me, I didn't do it, it has nothing to do with me, this is all a misunderstanding... Spare me, spare me... I'll go back to Great Black Mountain... I'll never come out again, alright...\"\n\nLu Ding strode forward and planted his foot on Ye Feng's chest.\n\nA series of *cracks* could be heard.\n\n\"A misunderstanding? It wasn't you? Here, take a look.\"\n\nLu Ding held up his phone, aiming it at Ye Feng's face. The screen was playing the very moment he had been posturing in Jie Shunan's office.\n\n\"People from Great Black Mountain have always been this arrogant...\"\n\n\"That Lu Ding is indeed powerful... but I'm not afraid of him. I'm just wary of 749 and can't afford to provoke him. If he wasn't backed by 749, I'd go kill him right now...\"\n\nEvery sentence, every word, came from the phone.\n\nIt was, without a doubt, his voice.\n\nLu Ding put away his phone. \"People from Great Black Mountain have always been this arrogant?\"\n\n\"Go on, be arrogant for me one more time. Conspiring to murder a 749 investigator, plus threatening and extorting an entrepreneur in my district... Ye Feng, oh, Ye Feng, how many heads do you have for me to wring? How dare you be so lawless!!!\"\n\n\"I was just talking... I was really just talking... I'll go back, I'll go back, I'll go back to Great Black Mountain, I swear I'll never come out again, I'll go back right now.\"\n\nJust as he finished speaking, the rapid *click-clack* of high heels on the ground sounded...\n\nJie Shunan came running over and delivered the final blow: \"Patrol Leader Lu, he also stole the gift I had prepared for you. I felt so bad about the incident at the Collapse Zone that I prepared a Sha-Nurturing Gourd to give you, but he stormed into my office and snatched it.\"\n\nSha-Nurturing Gourd?\n\nWhere was it?\n\nLu Ding turned his head and saw a jade gourd on the ground, smashed into pieces that could never be put back together.\n\nLu Ding: ......\n\n*Could it be that precious artifacts and I are truly not fated to be together?*\n\nJie Shunan added, \"It cost me fifty million, plus a favor I now owe.\"\n\nHearing this, Ye Feng shot a hateful glare at Jie Shunan.\n\n*This woman set me up!! She set me up!!!!!*\n\n\"No, I didn't, she didn't—\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you didn't? There's video proof. I told you that it wasn't something you should take, and I told you to give it back. But not only did you refuse, you threatened me.\"\n\nAs Jie Shunan said this, her expression was slightly aggrieved, but she could barely suppress the smile in her heart.\n\n*Serves you right for having sticky fingers. The habits of Great Black Mountain are impossible to change, always liking to snatch other people's things. Here's hoping you learn to control your hands in your next life. If it isn't yours, don't ever take it.*\n\n\"Excellent, excellent. You also embezzled public property, that's another charge. With your crimes combined, in my capacity as the Baofan District Patrol Leader and a 749 Probationary Investigator, I sentence you to death, to be carried out immediately!!\"\n\n\"No... *gack*...\"\n\nYe Feng still wanted to say his last words, but as Lu Ding's foot on his chest stomped down with sudden force, the immense pressure squeezed his internal organs up and out of his throat.\n\nA follow-up slash separated his head from his body, to prevent him from reanimating.\n\n\"Since when could a mere probationary investigator act with such impunity, making unilateral life-or-death judgments?\"\n\nThe newcomer stood silently atop a tree at the alley's entrance, arms crossed under the moonlight—a truly pretentious pose.\n\nSomeone had arrived, but just a step too late.\n\nYan Feifan pursed his lips.\n\nHe thought to himself, *Brother Lu can't stand it when someone tries to out-pose him. And this guy's attempt has no class at all. Does he really think he's some grand hero just because he's read a couple of wuxia novels?*\n\n\"Brother Qiu!\"\n\nCao Yuan cried out. He hadn't dared to speak until his backup had arrived.\n\nLu Ding's presence earlier had been too powerful, too tyrannical. From the moment Ye Feng was struck, Cao Yuan hadn't dared to utter another word, terrified that Lu Ding would casually strike him down too.\n\nYan Feifan quietly sidled up to Lu Ding's side.\n\n\"Brother Lu, this guy's name is Qiu Tianrang. Like us, he's a formal 749 investigator with a Spirit Sea cultivation level. His nickname is Ghost's Sorrow.\"\n\nEver since the incident at White Kiln Ancient Town, Yan Feifan had taken to reading up on the informal files of the Bureau's formal investigators in his spare time. It wasn't for any particular reason, other than to do his support job well. He knew that Lu Ding was bound to get entangled with other investigators in the future.\n\nAfter all, with Lu Ding's temper, \"entangled\" was putting it nicely. To put it badly, it meant conflict.\n\nAnd when conflict arose, knowing yourself and your enemy was the only way to win.\n\nAs it happened, that knowledge came in handy today.\n\nLu Ding looked at Qiu Tianrang on the treetop, then at Cao Yuan.\n\nHe seemed to understand something.\n\nIn his usual tone, he said, \"So who are you here to stand up for? Cao Yuan? Or Ye Feng? I'm working in my own district. It's not for others to come here and point fingers. If you don't understand that, let me put it more simply.\"\n\n\"This. Has. Nothing. To. Do. With. You.\"\n\n\"Understand?\"\n\nThe man made such a grand entrance, with such an attitude; he was clearly here to take control of the situation and act as someone's muscle. For a person like that, why would Lu Ding give him any face?\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ `姓陸的你` (xìng Lù de nǐ): A slightly disrespectful way of addressing someone by their surname, roughly equivalent to saying \"You, Lu!\" instead of using a proper title.",

Was it really something worth showing off?\n\nCao Yuan had originally wanted to say something, but after hearing Lu Ding's words, he decided to just go on mute.\n\nQiu Tianrang flew down from the treetops.\n\n\"Do you dare repeat what you just said!?\"\n\nAs his aura flared, its sharp edge swept past, making the skin of everyone present sting with pain.\n\nLu Ding just found this person amusing.\n\nWhat would repeating it prove?\n\nWas it to give himself an out for not saying it a second time, or was it to display his might as a powerful figure, a verbal intimidation?\n\nIf it was the first, then sorry, Lu Ding's first words were out, and he wouldn't change them even if asked ten or a hundred times.\n\nIf it was the second...\n\nThis person really didn't measure up. He wasn't strong enough.\n\n\"You don't need me to say it again, not even a hundred times. A Spirit Sea Realm cultivator like you is nothing special. How about this.\"\n\nLu Ding pointed to the corner outside Cao Family Alley where the large trash cans were piled up. \"One minute. Just one minute. If you're not lying in that spot within one minute, then whatever you say about today's matter, goes.\"\n\nQiu Tianrang narrowed his eyes. \"It's been a long time since I've seen an intern this arrogant. Do you really think that just because you can run wild in Baofan District, no one can put you in your place?\"\n\nHe knew Lu Ding's name, but so what?\n\nA genius?\n\nWho wasn't a genius?\n\nVicious?\n\nWho didn't kill with lethal force?\n\nThe very fact that he, Qiu Tianrang, was here today meant he wasn't the least bit afraid of Lu Ding.\n\nIt was still the same point.\n\nHe was just an intern investigator.\n\nHow vicious could you possibly be?\n\nBesides, his developmental period was clear, and he was a latecomer to the practice. If Lu Ding had come from a family of Qi Refiners or a lineage with a legacy, Qiu Tianrang wouldn't have shown up with this attitude today.\n\nLu Ding ignored him.\n\nThis person was just plain dense, and he couldn't be bothered to waste words on him.\n\nHe raised a hand over his shoulder, extending two fingers and beckoning to Yan Feifan behind him.\n\nA *beep* was heard.\n\nThe mechanical sound rang out, clear for all to hear.\n\n[One-minute countdown initiated]\n\n00:00:59\n\n00:00:58\n\nThe sound of a sword being drawn rang out. Qiu Tianrang was extremely fast, but Lu Ding was faster.\n\nA kick landed on the hand Qiu Tianrang was using to draw his sword, ramming the longsword—which had barely cleared its sheath by half a foot—back into its scabbard. Then, Lu Ding's right leg whipped out in a powerful horizontal strike.\n\n*Bang!!!*\n\nA figure bent slightly and flew backward, crashing heavily into the pile of garbage. Tissues flew everywhere, and green trash cans rolled about.\n\nSpeed, reflexes, power, physique—everything stemmed from the body.\n\nA somewhat talented Qi Refiner was trying to compete in close-quarters reflexes against Lu Ding, whose physical body had basically been buffed with cheats.\n\nWasn't this just asking for a beating?\n\nIf he had kept his distance, he wouldn't have suffered such an ugly defeat. With a bit of a buffer, he might have even lasted a few more moves.\n\nLu Ding laughed. His ancestor from a past life, Ying Zheng, had personally demonstrated this lesson for thousands of years. First, don't put an overly long weapon in a sheath—this applied especially to sabers and swords. Second, when drawing your sword, leave yourself enough time and enough space.\n\nOtherwise, you would face one of two outcomes.\n\nEither you'd end up being chased around like that old ancestor.\n\nOr you'd end up like Qiu Tianrang, sent flying on the spot, knocked out cold before you could even finish drawing your sword, your hand still on the hilt, the sword still in its sheath.\n\n\"Hahahahaha......\"\n\nLu Ding's laughter was mocking.\n\nHe started walking away. \"Let's go, Feifan. Time for hot pot. The last time I was at Dinghao Residential Complex, I smelled a hot pot place that was especially fragrant. Let's go try it.\"\n\nLu Ding was already getting a bit tired of eating at the Public Security Administration's cafeteria every day.\n\nAlthough the food was good and nutritionally balanced, you couldn't eat it every single day.\n\nA hot summer day just demanded hot pot to be satisfying.\n\nA fiery red broth paired with a bottle of ice-cold beer, and then when you're almost done, some iced Coke or Sprite—now that was pure bliss.\n\nThe atmosphere at the scene was terrifyingly quiet. The crowd just watched as Lu Ding departed.\n\nAfter a moment's thought, Xie Shunan followed after them.\n\nOnly after they were all gone did Cao Yuan dare to run to the garbage pile, help Qiu Tianrang up, and circulate his Qi to soothe the chaotic flow of vital energy in his body.\n\nThe moment he woke up, Qiu Tianrang drew his sword with a fierce jerk.\n\nAs sword Qi raged, he looked left and right, searching for Lu Ding. \"Where's Lu Ding! Where did Lu Ding go!!!?\"\n\nCao Yuan: .......\n\nHe truly hadn't expected the gap to be this enormous.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding had a fearsome reputation, he figured that Qiu Tianrang was, at the very least, a Spirit Sea Realm Qi Refiner, and like Lu Ding, an investigator from 749.\n\nOne an intern, the other formal.\n\nNo matter how you looked at it, Qiu Tianrang should have been the winner.\n\nThe result was a one-hit knockout.\n\nWhile Lu Ding had demonstrated the combat power to kill Spirit Sea Realm cultivators before, could a Spirit Sea Realm from the outside be the same as one from 749?\n\nThey were both human, but the gap between one person and another could be greater than the gap between a person and a dog.\n\nBut now, the facts proved it.\n\nFor others, it might be different, but for Lu Ding, it seemed to make no difference at all.\n\nIn the end, facing him had only one result: defeat.\n\nCao Yuan was beginning to regret his greed. He shouldn't have made a choice trying to have both the fish and the bear's paw.¹ Now, he had neither.\n\nNot only was Ye Feng dead, but he had also offended Lu Ding. His designs on the Xie family had also come to nothing...\n\nIf only he had known, wouldn't it have been better to just respectfully hand Ye Feng over and not notify his big brother!?\n\nUnfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world.\n\nSeeing Cao Yuan's silence and the place where he now stood, the earlier memory flooded back into Qiu Tianrang's mind.\n\nHe seemed to hallucinate Lu Ding's voice in his ear.\n\n\"One minute. Just one minute. If you're not lying in that spot within one minute..........\"\n\nQiu Tianrang looked down at the longsword in his hand.\n\nHe couldn't believe he had lost to Lu Ding without even managing to draw his sword, and that the defeat had been so clean and absolute.\n\n\"Didn't they say he only had Zhaoxuan-level cultivation? Is this Zhaoxuan?\"\n\nWhen one's cultivation was exquisite, it was like having a good skincare routine; it was difficult to judge a person's age from their appearance.\n\nAnd Lu Ding hadn't displayed any techniques unique to the Spirit Sea Realm.\n\nThis made it even harder for Qiu Tianrang to accept.\n\n\"Brother Qiu... are you alright?\" Cao Yuan finally asked.\n\n\"Alright?\"\n\n\"Do I look alright to you!? Where am I supposed to put my face after today!?\"\n\n\"They call me Ghost-Dreader Qiu, 'cause even ghosts dread the sight of me. But the problem is, now *I'm* the one who gets a headache just thinking about Lu Ding. He's more dreadful to me than I am to ghosts!!!\"\n\nThat kick from Lu Ding had left him with a psychological scar.\n\nIf the two of them had exchanged three or four moves before Qiu Tianrang was defeated, he would at most have felt dejected, then turned shame into courage.\n\nBut this was a one-move knockout, and the man had even told him in advance where he'd end up lying. This wasn't just dejection; this was a goddamn psychological complex!!\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹An idiom meaning to want two mutually exclusive things, similar to \"have your cake and eat it too.\"",

Your elder brother can't handle him, that's something I can confirm and be certain of.\"\n\n\"No way, my elder brother is so strong, didn't you say...\"\n\n\"Talk, talk, talk, what's there to talk about? No matter how strong your elder brother is, he can't one-shot me!!!\"\n\nCao Yuan's words were cut off.\n\nSo what should we do now?\n\nHas Lu Ding already set his sights on him?\n\nAnd Lu Ding is still the Inspector of Baofan District; the day of his reassignment is still far off.\n\nThe thought of having to work under Lu Ding's nose from now on.\n\nCao Yuan's heart inexplicably tightened!\n\nNo, this won't do!!\n\nHe looked up at Qiu Tianrang, intending to say something, but Qiu Tianrang was on the phone at that moment.\n\nWangjiang City, Feilu Lake National Wetland Park.\n\nDozens of 749 Official Investigators were besieging the remnants of the Drunken Deity Sect.\n\nThe Drunken Deity Sect, a minor sect, as the name suggests, is a group of drunkards. Under the guise of being uninhibited and unrestrained, they commit unlawful acts, blurring the lines between good and evil.\n\nThey call it \"unrestrained,\" and when they drink too much, they'll do anything. For a good drink, they'll go to any lengths; everything can be steeped in wine, including humans!\n\nIt's unknown where this Drunken Deity Sect got their recipe for brewing wine using human ingredients. They use a secret technique combined with various medicinal herbs to make a fermented mash for people to consume, waiting for it to ferment. When the time is right, they drain blood and collect it as wine.\n\nThey even claim it's \"mellow and smooth on the throat, with a long-lasting aftertaste.\" For such a cult, their only awaited end is destruction.\n\nAnd so, 749 dispatched dozens of Official Investigators and hundreds of Intern Investigators.\n\nThe higher-ups directly appointed a Destiny Realm expert to lead the team, to encircle and annihilate the Drunken Deity Sect, ensuring they are completely wiped out before the Ghost Festival, lest these troublesome elements fish in troubled waters and endanger the lives of ordinary people.\n\nWen Yuquan and Yin Feng were also among them.\n\nThis also included Cao Yuan's elder brother, Cao Zi'ang.\n\nWith a Tiger Head Hook, Reaper's Throat-Slicing, taking the life of a Drunken Deity Sect member, Cao Zi'ang swung his weapon and pulled out his phone from his bag.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you I was on a mission? Why are you calling me?\"\n\nQiu Tianrang on the other end immediately said: \"You really put me in a bind!\"\n\nCao Zi'ang was somewhat confused: \"Weren't you going to find Xiao Yuan? How did I screw you over?\"\n\n\"I ask you, what realm did you say Lu Ding was in?\"\n\nFacing Qiu Tianrang's question, Cao Zi'ang blurted out: \"Illumination Realm, but he should have the combat power of a typical Spirit Sea Realm cultivator. What's wrong, is that not right?\"\n\n\"You ask me? I was going to ask you! Can an Illumination Realm cultivator one-shot me? Can a typical Spirit Sea Realm cultivator's combat power one-shot me?\"\n\nQiu Tianrang spoke excitedly, while Cao Zi'ang listened in silence.\n\nOne-shot...\n\nIllumination Realm...\n\nThe more he heard it, the more out of place it felt.\n\nHe even asked somewhat uncertainly: \"You mean Lu Ding one-shotted you?\"\n\n\"I'm ashamed to even say it myself. To be precise, he informed me beforehand that he was going to attack, even planned out where I would lie down, and then one-shotted me. And I even struck first, but he moved later and arrived sooner.\"\n\nCao Zi'ang felt like he was listening to gibberish.\n\nSince when did Illumination Realm cultivators have such terrifying combat power?\n\nHe pondered Lu Ding's information in his mind.\n\nAfter rehearsing countless times in his mind, he asked: \"There's only one possibility for him to one-shot you: you were face to face, he didn't give you time to draw your sword, and defeated you using only his physical body.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\nQiu Tianrang was somewhat surprised. Cao Zi'ang wasn't even here, how did he know so clearly?\n\nCao Zi'ang shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"I've told you many times, we are modern people; think first, act second. Lu Ding's achievements and deeds don't require special research; you can find them easily on our bureau's website.\"\n\n\"He cultivates the Flying Bear Contemplation Method, and should have comprehended a rather profound physical cultivation technique, which is why his physical body is extremely formidable. He was able to kill Yuan Baifeng of the Heavenly Principle Cult, who was known for his physical prowess, while still in the Illumination Realm.\"\n\n\"If you fight him purely with physical strength, you won't gain any advantage. Although his ability to one-shot you was somewhat unexpected, it's also within reason. When facing someone like him, you should maintain your distance, use spells for feints, and swordsmanship as support. Pay attention to dodging his slashes. The decisive blow lies in your mind, not in your technique.\"\n\nCao Zi'ang spoke logically and clearly, and Qiu Tianrang listened, finding it reasonable, but he felt somewhat uncomfortable.\n\nIsn't this just hindsight?\n\nWhy didn't you say this before I came?\n\nWhat's the use of saying it now?\n\nAnd besides, he also knew a little about Lu Ding's affairs.\n\n\"Wasn't that old man surnamed Huang in the collapsed area also a Spirit Sea Realm cultivator, and he specialized in spells? According to you, how was he killed by Lu Ding?\"\n\nHearing this.\n\nCao Zi'ang instantly felt that Qiu Tianrang was somewhat foolish.\n\n\"You yourself said he specialized in spells, so his physical body must have been a weakness. If Lu Ding got close to him, he definitely couldn't win. Moreover, Lu Ding isn't without long-range attack methods. His only shortcoming is that his cultivation time is too short, and he hasn't had much time to cultivate other spells. One must prescribe the right remedy for the illness. A lion uses its full strength even to hunt a rabbit. You, ah, you simply underestimated him.\"\n\nThey were all proud individuals. Friends are friends, and feelings are feelings.\n\nHelping you out and getting beaten for it, not only does he get no good in return from you, but he also gets lectured.\n\nWho with any temper could stand that?\n\n\"Fuck you, Cao Zi'ang, fuck you!!!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I underestimated him, you're amazing, you're awesome. Go settle accounts with Lu Ding yourself, I'm done with this, goodbye!!\"\n\nA dial tone came from the other end of the phone.\n\nCao Zi'ang looked at the phone and said to the person next to him: \"Look, this guy's impatient again.\"\n\n\"Brother Tianrang is still so impetuous. Just invite him for a drink when we get back, and he'll be fine.\"\n\nThe person who replied smiled, making one feel as if bathed in a spring breeze.\n\nAfter the first impression, you would only think this person was gentle and refined, but the more you looked, the more you would find them handsome.\n\nThe constant smile on their face and their crescent-shaped eyes were pleasing to the eye.\n\nOriginally, narrow eyes would be a flaw, but on this person's face, combined with dimples on both sides, it became an irreplaceable feature.\n\nThis person was precisely the Gentle Immortal Official, Wen Ruchu, who, like Lu Ding, had risen to fame as an Intern Investigator.\n\n\"But then there's Lu Ding, Brother Zi'ang, what do you plan to do? We're all colleagues, so please don't make it too ugly.\"\n\nCao Zi'ang put his phone back: \"You're right, but as a senior, I need to teach him what respect means. Showing off physical prowess is merely a minor path.\"\n\nPhysical body, who doesn't cultivate a physical body?\n\nCao Zi'ang's physical body was also formidable, but he couldn't possibly imagine that his physical body and Lu Ding's physical body were not on the same level at all.\n\n\"As for you, with Lu Ding's sudden rise, are you confident about this year's Inaugural Martial Arts Debate? Or rather, do you have the confidence to defeat Bai Hemian and Tantai Xianyue?\"\n\nWen Ruchu didn't take it to heart: \"It's best if I can enter the top three, but it's fine if I can't. Just don't hurt our colleagues' feelings.\"\n\nIt was a good thing Yan Feifan wasn't there. If he had heard that, he'd definitely curse in his heart: \"A toad pretending to be a frog, you're pretending your mother.^1 Anyway, no matter win or lose, you always have something to say, you damn squinty-eyes.\"\n\n---\n^1: The original phrase \"你在裝你媽\" (nǐ zài zhuāng nǐ mā) is a highly colloquial and vulgar expression, literally meaning \"you're pretending your mother.\" It conveys extreme contempt and annoyance, implying someone is being hypocritical or putting on a fake show.",

    "content": "Meanwhile.\n\nLu Ding, guided by memory, directed Yan Feifan to drive to the hotpot restaurant whose smell he had accidentally encountered last time.\n\nHe had actually wanted to try it that day.\n\nBut eating hotpot alone was a bit strange.\n\nIt just so happened that today's events were also worth celebrating; they had, one way or another, eliminated a hidden danger.\n\nMoreover, Yan Feifan had also made a breakthrough.\n\nNow there were three of them, so eating hotpot to liven things up wasn't bad either.\n\nIn the car.\n\nSeeing Xie Shunan, who seemed a little reserved, Lu Ding casually said, \"What are you afraid of? Didn't you say you had something to discuss with me in person?\"\n\n\"Go on, I have time now.\"\n\nOriginally, Xie Shunan had thought of talking to Lu Ding about Ye Feng.\n\nBut now there was no need to talk; the person was dead, so what was there to discuss?\n\nFurthermore, Lu Ding hadn't mentioned anything else from beginning to end.\n\nThis made Xie Shunan feel uneasy.\n\nShe had thought a lot along the way. Now that Lu Ding had spoken first, she said, \"Patrol Commander Lu, thank you for helping my Xie family resolve this crisis. I have nothing to repay you with, but please tell me what you need; as long as my Xie family has it, we can satisfy you.\"\n\nAlthough Lu Ding did it for himself this time, the elimination of the Xie family's crisis was undeniably part of it.\n\nHe didn't stand on ceremony.\n\nHe said directly, \"I don't need anything else. Just help me find some natural treasures and exotic materials. I need high-quality ones.\"\n\nMagical artifacts were certainly good, and Lu Ding was tempted, but his own strength was the most important thing. To forge iron, one must be strong oneself.*\n\nAlthough good natural treasures and exotic materials were hard to find, if the Xie family put their heart into it, it wasn't impossible to find them.\n\nThis request wasn't difficult.\n\nXie Shunan asked again, \"Then... is there anything else?\"\n\n\"No, I just want natural treasures and exotic materials.\"\n\n\"Alright, Patrol Commander Lu, I'll send you an update in some time.\"\n\nAfter saying that, she said to Yan Feifan, who was driving, \"Patrol Commander Yan, please drop me off at the next intersection. I'll go back by myself.\"\n\n\"So early? Since you're already here, it's just one more pair of chopsticks. Why not eat something before you go back?\"*\n\nLu Ding's humanistic habits from his previous life were still influencing him.\n\nFor example, \"Since you're already here, it's just one more pair of chopsticks.\"\n\nOne bite of food won't make you poor or make others rich.\n\n\"No, no, Patrol Commander Lu, my father doesn't know about this matter yet. I need to go back and tell him.\"\n\nSince she said that, Lu Ding couldn't insist.\n\nHe found an intersection and dropped her off.\n\nWatching the receding taillights.\n\nXie Shunan felt in her heart that Lu Ding wasn't actually that scary.\n\nThe premise was that you shouldn't provoke him.\n\nIf well water doesn't interfere with river water, he's still very gentle.*\n\nAs for where he was gentle?\n\nHe even invited people to eat hotpot together; wasn't that gentle?\n\nPerhaps if someone else invited her, Xie Shunan would call them crazy. \"I'm a CEO, and you're asking me to eat hotpot with you in the middle of the night?\"\n\nBut Lu Ding...\n\nHe was different, so it was another matter.\n\nThe car drove, winding and turning, and they even had to get out to climb slopes and cross ridges. Finally, under Lu Ding's keen sense of smell,\n\nThe Shu-style Old Hotpot hidden deep in the alley was successfully found by him.\n\nEntering the restaurant, ordering, the pot came, bubbling, picking up tripe and dipping it \"seven up and eight down\"*, putting it into the mouth while still a little hot, crisp, spicy, refreshing, and then a bottle of ice-cold beer.\n\nSo satisfying!!!\n\n.....\n\nCloud Sea Broken Bridge Pier.\n\nAt four in the morning, Tang Bao watched the floating sparks of talismans, sleepless, and couldn't help but think, \"Damn it, what the hell are these foreigners going crazy about!!!\"\n\nRecently, with the Ghost Festival approaching, the yang energy of heaven and earth had weakened, and various ghosts and monsters* were emerging endlessly.\n\nThe business of the Five Viscera Living Society had also increased.\n\nDue to Tang Hu's self-inflicted troubles, the Five Viscera Living Society was short one strong warrior.\n\nTang Bao, who was originally mostly in charge of management, was now personally on the front line.\n\nIn the evening.\n\nThe Khmer businessman he dealt with suddenly sent him a message asking if he was interested in taking on a job, saying the client was extremely wealthy.\n\nWhen he asked for details about the job, the Khmer man stammered for a long time before getting to the point, saying it was about performing a deliverance ritual for resentful spirits and deceased souls, and dispelling malevolent energy.\n\nTang Bao heard this and thought, \"This job is doable, it's right up my alley.\"\n\nHe could just send any member of the society.\n\nThen he asked, \"How much?\"\n\nThe Khmer man immediately said fifty million.\n\nTang Bao had just picked up his teacup but hadn't brought it to his mouth before putting it down again.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Fifty million? For a deliverance ritual for deceased souls and resentful spirits, and dispelling some malevolent energy, you're giving me fifty million?\"\n\nHe felt something wasn't right, but money was tempting, and a job this big didn't come along often.\n\nSo Tang Bao prepared to go himself. As soon as he agreed, they told him to meet them tonight at Cloud Sea Broken Bridge Pier.\n\nBut after thinking it over, Tang Bao still felt that fifty million for dispelling malevolent energy and performing deliverance was abnormal. Here, he played a trick: he grabbed a handful of incense ashes from the incense hall, kneaded them into the shape of a mud doll, and then consecrated it with a drop of his tongue blood to imbue it with a spirit.\n\nHe was going, yes, but he would hide far away and use this thing to perform the ritual in his place.\n\nIf there were no problems, that would be best. If there was a small problem, he would appear in his true form and just take a little less money. If it was a big problem, he would simply run away.\n\nAs soon as he arrived, the Khmer man stood by his side like a subordinate.\n\nLeading them were a Dahan woman and a few white-skinned people.\n\nThe more Tang Bao looked at that woman, the more familiar she seemed. On closer inspection, wasn't this Cao Yuan's mother who had just returned from abroad?\n\nAfter communicating for a bit, Tang Bao realized that Cao Yuan's mother and these white-skinned people were actually the clients.\n\nBut it didn't matter, as long as they paid.\n\nAs they instructed, Tang Bao set up the altar at the pier entrance. He waited for an hour, then another, until he heard a \"woo-woo\" sound of a ship's whistle, and a cruise ship approached from a distance.\n\nThat thing was spewing black smoke as if it were on fire, looking incredibly conspicuous even at night. Of course, it wasn't actually on fire; it was resentful energy.\n\nThe moment he saw the cruise ship, Tang Bao's heart began to pound.\n\n\"What the hell is inside this thing!\"\n\nSoon, his doubts were answered.\n\nAs the cruise ship docked, Cao Yuan's mother, the white-skinned people, and the Khmer man all knelt down.\n\nOn the deck, a pale-faced, delicate-skinned white man, dressed in a tuxedo, wearing a top hat, holding a cane, with his chin slightly raised, a disdainful attitude apparent on his face.\n\nAs the cruise ship docked.\n\nThe man's figure dispersed, turning into a swarm of bats that descended and then gathered back into human form.\n\nOnly at this moment did Tang Bao recognize that the man was a vampire.\n\nBut this wasn't his business; he just needed to do what the clients asked.\n\nThe vampire didn't even look at him, simply walked on his own, his eyes always looking straight ahead, never deviating, fully adopting that aristocratic posture.\n\nCao Yuan's mother came up and told Tang Bao he could start.\n\nAs he shook the bell and burned talismans, one, two, three, ten, a hundred, and finally hundreds of shadow-like obsessions, fueled by malevolent energy, floated onto the cruise ship.\n\nThe talismans ignited, burning with a faint green light.\n\nTang Bao froze in place.\n\nIt wasn't until the flames burned his fingertips that he snapped awake.\n\n\"These obsessions all have Dahan people's faces!!!?\"\n\nThe old immortal possessing him sighed in his mind and said, \"They were harmed by beasts...\"\n\nA surging anger instantly rushed into Tang Bao's brain.\n\nThe Khmer man noticed Tang Bao's mood was off.\n\nHe hurriedly came up and said, \"Tang Bao, I hope you understand that I introduced you to this business entirely because you're clever. Ms. Jia and Count Fielder, thanks to my introduction, both trust you very much. We are friends, so please don't do anything to harm our friendship!!!!\"\n\n\"Whether it's Ms. Jia or Count Fielder, you can't afford to provoke them.\"\n\n\"You Dahan people have an old saying: 'He who understands the times is a wise man.'* I hope you understand this.\"\n\nTang Bao looked at the person in front of him and said, \"So, everyone on this ship was killed by them?\"\n\n\"Listen to me...\"\n\n\"Answer me, were these people on this ship killed by them!!!?\"\n\nThe Khmer man hadn't expected Tang Bao's reaction to be so intense.\n\nThe quarrel here attracted the attention of the surrounding white-skinned people and Jia Yuanfang.\n\nThe vampire, however, remained still, as if Tang Bao didn't exist in his eyes at all.\n\n\"Tang Bao, what are you doing?\"\n\nJia Yuanfang walked over, with two white-skinned individuals behind her glaring at Tang Bao, emanating a powerful aura.\n\nSeeing this scene, how could Tang Bao not know that if he had come in his true form today and caused such a scene, he would definitely not be able to leave.\n\nBut thankfully, he had sent a fake body.\n\n\"Alright, I can't afford to provoke you, but surely someone can, right? You're awesome, but you can't be awesome forever. Jia Yuanfang, you're screwed. You caused such a big incident in his jurisdiction. You're fucking screwed, you bitch, I'll fuck you!!!\"\n\n---\n*   **To forge iron, one must be strong oneself (打鐵還需自身硬 - dǎtiě hái xū zìshēn yìng):** An idiom meaning that to accomplish things, one must be strong or capable oneself.\n*   **Since you're already here, it's just one more pair of chopsticks (來都來了，多雙筷子的事情 - lái dōu lái le, duō shuāng kuàizi de shìqing):** A common Chinese expression of hospitality, implying that accommodating one more person for a meal is a minor thing.\n*   **If well water doesn't interfere with river water (井水不犯河水 - jǐng shuǐ bù fàn hé shuǐ):** An idiom meaning to mind one's own business and not interfere with others.\n*   **Seven up, eight down (七上八下 - qī shàng bā xià):** A hotpot cooking technique, particularly for thin slices of meat or tripe, where the food is quickly dipped into and out of the boiling broth several times until just cooked.\n*   **Various ghosts and monsters (牛鬼蛇神 - niúguǐ shéshén):** An idiom literally meaning \"ox-headed devils and snake-bodied demons,\" referring to various evil spirits, monsters, or sinister characters.\n*   **He who understands the times is a wise man (識時務者為俊傑 - shí shí wù zhě wèi jùnjié):** An idiom meaning that a wise person is one who is pragmatic and adapts to current circumstances.",

    "content": "…\n\nBefore they could act, Tang Bao turned and leaped into the sea.\n\nFrom the shadows, he controlled the mud figure, letting it swim as far as it could.\n\nMeanwhile, he himself quietly sent a message to Lu Ding, then moved inch by inch to escape.\n\nOn the pier, two white-skinned men jumped into the water after him.\n\nOn the shore, Jia Yuanfang's face was grim.\n\nOriginally, the Vampire Count's visit shouldn't have been so troublesome, but on the way here, the Count had massacred everyone on the cruise ship. The blood-food wasn't much; it was more for finding some amusement during the boring voyage.\n\nIn its eyes, ordinary people were even lower than cattle and livestock.\n\nSo killing them was just killing them!\n\nBut the consequence was that Jia Yuanfang had to clean up its mess.\n\nThis matter was not easy to resolve.\n\nFirst, you needed to find someone capable of dispelling the resentment of hundreds of unjustly deceased souls.\n\nThese people had all died at sea, and the ship was heading for their home country. Each of them had harbored thoughts and hopes of returning home before they died, making their怨煞 (resentful evil) energy even more terrifying than that of ordinary people!\n\nSo it definitely required true skill.\n\nSecond!\n\nThe person presiding over the ritual must be nearby, must be sensible, and must have professional ethics, ensuring they wouldn't leak anything.\n\nOtherwise, one misstep, and the people from 749 would pounce like sharks smelling blood.\n\nTo have true skill, be sensible, be nearby (to avoid being detected by 749 personnel if they traveled too far, or to prevent a premature eruption of resentful evil if they arrived too late), and also possess professional ethics—such a combination of conditions was almost non-existent.\n\nBut it was at this moment that the Khmer people they collaborated with recommended the Five Viscera Agency.\n\nFirstly, the Five Viscera Agency was professionally qualified and nearby, right in Baofan District. Secondly, Tang Bao was very clever; his professional ethics were practically an industry benchmark, or else he wouldn't have been able to grow the Five Viscera Agency to such a scale.\n\nJia Yuanfang instantly thought of this young man she had met once before.\n\nAfter gathering a little more intelligence and reviewing it, she immediately made a decision.\n\nHe's the one!\n\nHowever, these people, no matter how much they calculated, didn't account for the fact that while Tang Bao might seem to have no bottom line, on such an issue, if he hesitated for even a second, he would be an animal.\n\nYes, he wasn't a good person to begin with.\n\nBut that was a personal matter.\n\nThis current situation had nothing to do with personal character.\n\nAnyone in his place wouldn't tolerate it for a second.\n\nTang Bao's words echoed in Jia Yuanfang's mind, and she felt waves of trigeminal neuralgia.\n\nLu Ding… Corpse-Disintegrating Tai Sui.\n\nWhat a hassle.\n\nFortunately, most of 749's idle forces were out. As long as this place was cleaned up and no evidence was left, there shouldn't be any accidents.\n\nBut to be safe, she still turned to the Vampire Count and said, \"Count Fidel, please move to another location. We will handle things here and absolutely ensure no flies disturb your pleasure.\"\n\nThe Vampire Count nodded slightly: \"Mysterious oriental land, I love it too much. Tonight, help me find some delicious ladies; I need to chat with them about life.\"\n\n\"As you command, my Count.\"\n\nMeanwhile, elsewhere.\n\nLu Ding and Yan Feifan, each with at least five bottles of beer, had eaten the hot pot restaurant's back kitchen completely empty.\n\nThey were just short of gnawing on the potatoes piled in the corner of the warehouse.\n\nThis hot pot restaurant wasn't large to begin with; its usual stock of side dishes was always enough.\n\nBut today's situation was completely beyond the owner's expectations.\n\nWho would have thought two such enormous eaters and drinkers would show up?\n\nBoth were Qi Cultivators, and Lu Ding's physical body was exceptionally strong. The food here was also delicious. When he threw himself into eating with abandon, very few establishments could withstand him.\n\n*Ding-dong*.\n\nLu Ding had just picked up a slice of lotus root, about to put it in his mouth, when he heard his phone ring.\n\nHe picked it up and saw:\n\n[Five Viscera Agency Tang Bao: Inspector Lu, something big has happened! That bitch Jia Yuanfang, together with a vampire from abroad, has massacred hundreds of ordinary people at the Yunhai Broken Bridge Pier. The entire cruise ship is filled with overwhelming resentment, and now they want to kill me to silence me! Come quickly!!!!]\n\nJia Yuanfang?\n\nA vampire?\n\nMassacred hundreds of people!!!!\n\nLu Ding shot to his feet.\n\nSeeing his solemn expression, Yan Feifan quickly put down his beer bottle: \"What's wrong, Brother Lu?\"\n\n\"Someone's a turncoat and trying to stir up trouble for us.\"¹\n\nLu Ding grabbed his clothes, tossed his phone in front of Yan Feifan. Yan Feifan read the entire message.\n\n\"Jia Yuanfang, isn't that Cao Yuan's biological mother from Cao Family Alley, the one who came back from abroad? The one who brought foreign capital, saying she'd do business in Yunhai?\"\n\nCao Yuan from Cao Family Alley?\n\nGood, good, good, it's you again!\n\nYou must have lived long enough, I suppose. Ye Feng was connected to you, and seeing you not speak or interfere, I had thought the matter was settled.\n\nBut just when you were done,\n\nYour mother starts stirring up trouble again.\n\nNext time, will it be your father, your grandfather, your ancestors?!\n\nAnd she brought in a vampire too—what a novelty, rare, an unusual specimen!\n\nWonder what rewards I'll get for killing it.\n\nLu Ding's heart was filled with anticipation as he spoke without delay:\n\n\"Feifan, call the receiving department and get the information on Jia Yuanfang and the foreign capital behind her. I'll go to Yunhai Broken Bridge Pier first to check it out.\"\n\nHe knew in his heart that if he went now, it was highly likely the people would already be gone.\n\nAfter all, Tang Bao had exposed them; they wouldn't stay there waiting for a potential risk.\n\nBut even so, Lu Ding still had to go.\n\nSince Tang Bao could report to him, he was determined to protect this person!\n\nEven the King of Hell couldn't take him away!\n\nIf he couldn't protect Tang Bao today, who would dare to send him information in similar situations in the future?\n\nWhen playing an undercover game, everyone fears meeting an unreliable superior.\n\n\"Brother Lu, I'll handle it right away! I'll go get the car first!\"\n\nYan Feifan got up and walked out. As for drinking and driving, who cared about that right now?\n\n\"Just drive over. Be careful on the road. I'll get there first and wait for you.\"\n\nDriving would be too slow. By the time they arrived, Tang Bao would probably be dead.\n\nLu Ding strode out of the hot pot restaurant's door and flew straight away, leaving the sanitation worker uncle sweeping the street in the early morning utterly dumbfounded.\n\nWas it his time?\n\nThe sky collapsed, for crying out loud!!!\n\nAt this moment.\n\nOn Tang Bao's side, yes, he had used a decoy and a fake body to attract attention. But the others, though a bit pale-skinned, weren't stupid. After swimming a few laps and discovering that the person previously in sight had suddenly disintegrated into a puff of incense ash that dispersed with the water,\n\nEveryone understood what had happened.\n\nHadn't they just been played?\n\nThey turned back to shore and began their search.\n\nTang Bao's speed was deliberately slow to avoid attracting the vampire's attention during his retreat. The white-skinned men, however, regained their composure quickly, and within ten minutes, they found him by the traces he left behind.\n\nThey pursued him relentlessly.\n\nEventually,\n\nThey cornered Tang Bao inside a park.\n\n\"Fuck, you cunning Han man, run again, why don't you!!\"\n\nThe white-skinned man stretched his neck: \"Now, come back with us and obediently handle the pier matter, and we can pretend nothing happened.\"\n\nThe resentful evil energy at the pier was still present. Tang Bao might not survive, but he had to complete the task before he died.\n\nThis was the mission Jia Yuanfang had given them.\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: The original Chinese idiom \"吃裡扒外給咱上眼藥\" (chī lǐ bā wài gěi zán shàng yǎnyào) literally means \"eating from the inside and tearing down from the outside, and giving us eye drops.\" It implies someone betraying their own group's interests while also badmouthing or causing trouble for them. The adapted translation \"Someone's a turncoat and trying to stir up trouble for us\" captures this meaning.",

    "content": "Tang Bao scanned his surroundings. Four white-skinned men, positioned at the four cardinal directions—east, south, west, and north—surrounded him. Each of them exuded a formidable aura; even the deceased Tang Hu would be slightly weaker than any of them.\n\nAnd there were four of them.\n\nTang Bao sneered. It had always been their three brothers ganging up on others. The purpose of establishing the Five Viscera Cultivation Society was also to bully the weak with numbers and band together for warmth.*\n\nWho would have thought, who would have thought, that today he would actually be reduced to being ganged up on.\n\n\"Finish the job, or I'll finish your mom, alright? You dumbass white pig! Although I specialize in divination and rituals, my martial arts skills are also not inferior. Come on!!!!\"\n\nThe four white-skinned men exchanged glances.\n\nSince talking was useless, they'd just fight first.\n\nThe four men simultaneously attacked, their fists raining down on Tang Bao.\n\nEven then, he was still talking tough.\n\nWhile resisting, he shouted, \"Haven't you eaten? It doesn't hurt!\"\n\n\"F*ck, you stubborn yellow monkey, try this and see if it hurts!!!\"\n\nOne of the white-skinned men tore off a trash can fixed to a nearby stand and was about to smash it onto Tang Bao's head.\n\nSuddenly, a black speck fell from the sky, gradually enlarging into a human figure, and directly slammed into the white-skinned man who was holding up the trash can.\n\nHe trampled both the person and the trash can into a pulp.\n\nBoom!!!!\n\nThe unexpected situation in the arena and such brutal methods drew the attention of the other three men.\n\n\"Who are you?\" one of the white-skinned men asked.\n\n\"I am God!\" Lu Ding answered, and in the same instant, he raised his hand into a palm, his fingertips thrusting directly forward, piercing through the man's face and emerging from the back of his head.\n\nSuch a method instantly shocked the other two.\n\nNow, no more harsh words or doubts could be uttered; the thoughts in their minds were simultaneously replaced by \"run fast.\"\n\nAppeared and someone died, attacked and it was an instant kill.\n\nWith such combat power, how dare they get involved!?\n\n\"Running? Now you know to run? What were you doing when you were hitting me just now, Patrol Officer Lu? I'm telling on them, they hit me!!\"\n\nTang Bao shouted. Lu Ding vaguely heard a sense of grievance in it, though he wasn't sure if it was an illusion.\n\nHe didn't care if it was an illusion.\n\nToday, Lu Ding would take charge of this matter.\n\nHis figure flashed.\n\nHe raised his hand, half-turning it into a claw, clamped onto the back of a fleeing man's neck with such force that he pulled out the head along with the spine to use as a weapon, violently smashing it into the person next to him.\n\nHe directly smashed the other man from the right shoulder, the impact emerging from below the ribs, splitting him into two halves before he fell to the ground.\n\nLu Ding wielded the blunt object as if it were a sharp weapon.\n\nHe flicked the object in his hand.\n\nHe pulled out a wet wipe from his bag to clean his hands, then handed one to Tang Bao: \"How are you? Are you alright?\"\n\nAt this moment, Tang Bao finally understood Yan Feifan's feelings.\n\nSo what if I'm weak?\n\nSo what if I'm no good?\n\nThere's someone strong willing to take me under their wing, and he's strong in an utterly unreasonable way!\n\nYes, you're strong, he's strong, you're all strong, but are you stronger than Lu Ding?\n\nSorry, I'm with Lu Ding. For that alone, it's useless if you're stronger than me; you have to be stronger than Lu Ding.\n\nDon't even mention that I'm a Zhaoxuan; I'm just a f*cking ordinary person, do you dare to lay a finger on me without reason!?\n\nSecurity, nothing but security.\n\nA succubus, this is definitely a succubus!\n\nThoughts intertwined in his mind. After a long moment, Tang Bao came back to his senses, took the wet wipe, and cleaned the blood from his face.\n\n\"N-nothing... nothing, Patrol Officer Lu. My bones are hard, their fists are soft. Small problem.\"\n\n\"Tell me about the Broken Bridge Wharf.\"\n\nTang Bao recounted everything in detail: \"Yesterday, I received news from the Khmer people. They said they had a job for me, with a reward of fifty million...\"\n\nFrom start to finish, there was not the slightest concealment.\n\nLu Ding listened to the entire story.\n\n\"They should not be at the wharf now; they've gone back to their company. Patrol Officer Lu, do you think we should notify the higher-ups?\"\n\nTang Bao asked tentatively. He had originally thought that, given Lu Ding's temperament, he would directly go after them in this situation, just like with his second brother Tang Hu back then.\n\nBut to his surprise, Lu Ding spoke: \"Of course we need to report it.\"\n\nIf he went there now, the number of people he'd kill would definitely not be small.\n\nWithout reporting in advance, and since they're all foreigners, it would be difficult to handle.\n\nLu Ding knew his own situation.\n\nHe couldn't tolerate this even a little, so he couldn't go easy even a little when he acted.\n\nMoreover, he wouldn't just report it; he'd make it sound more serious.\n\nHowever, the prerequisite for reporting was to have both human testimony and physical evidence.\n\nOnly by ensuring the authenticity of the matter could it be reported upwards.\n\nJust like the last Yin Realm Overlap.\n\nCoincidentally, Tang Bao just said that these white-skinned men told him to go back and finish the remaining rituals, which means the resentful spirits and malevolent energy at the Broken Bridge Wharf should still be there temporarily.\n\nNow that they had human testimony, they just needed to get the physical evidence.\n\nOnce reported, without waiting for the 749 personnel to arrive, Lu Ding would directly go and act expediently, the pavilion closest to the water enjoys the moonlight first*. He would kill the vampires, then take Cao Yuan's mother to find Cao Yuan to see his reaction. If there was any problem, he would arrest both mother and son and execute them on the spot!\n\nLu Ding had already thought of the charges: murdering hundreds of ordinary people, threatening public order, colluding with foreign demons, and treason!!\n\nWith these charges, even if he killed them eight hundred times over, no one would dare to say Lu Ding was in the wrong.\n\nDaring to harm ordinary people with demons, their path had already narrowed.*\n\nHe stood up.\n\n\"I'm going to the Broken Bridge Wharf now to take a look. You go back first.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, Patrol Officer Lu, I'd better stay with you.\"\n\nTang Bao quickly stood up too. Perhaps Jia Yuanfang had already arranged for people to wait for him at the Five Viscera Cultivation Society, ready for him to walk into their trap.\n\nEarlier, when he was notifying Lu Ding, he had already informed his eldest brother to go into hiding.\n\nLeaving Lu Ding now would be seeking death.\n\nIt would give them an opportunity to pick them off one by one.\n\nTang Bao wasn't stupid; he wouldn't do something like that.\n\nLu Ding saw through his thoughts.\n\nTo help someone to the end, to send the Buddha to the Western Paradise*—Tang Bao truly shouldn't have to bear such a risk.\n\nYou couldn't just use someone and then abandon them, could you?\n\nThat wouldn't be proper.\n\n\"Alright, then you can come with me to the Broken Bridge Wharf first.\"\n\nHe grabbed Tang Bao by the collar and flew into the sky.\n\nFeeling the clouds recede and the scenery shift behind them, Tang Bao felt a surge of envy. When would *he* be able fly?\n\nAlthough he could also traverse the sky by borrowing techniques, at most it was gliding, not flying.\n\nIf he could fly, even if he couldn't win a fight, he could still run away.\n\nOriginally, he had been thinking whether Lu Ding would have trouble dealing with the vampires.\n\nBut now, looking at this...\n\nVampires were sh*t!\n\nEven if they couldn't win, they could run. Although vampires could also fly, compared to Lu Ding's speed, it was completely the difference between a wild duck and a fighter jet, and they even had to transform into a swarm of bats.\n\nWeren't they just beasts?\n\nFlapping their wings, how fast could they go?\n\nJust big flapping moths.\n\nLu Ding was very fast, and soon they arrived above the Broken Bridge Wharf.\n\nLooking down at the cruise ship docked below, a sky-piercing aura of resentment and malevolence permeated the air. Lingering obsessions remained; they had boarded the cruise ship with the thought of returning home, yet their homeland was within reach, but they could not disembark.\n\nThese were the people who had died at sea.\n\nRage welled up in Lu Ding's heart, his breathing became uneven. He disliked what he saw, and the more he thought about it, the more suffocated he felt. He didn't know why these people were on the ship, but seeing their obsession to return home was enough.\n\nPerhaps they were crew members, perhaps tourists seeing the world, perhaps something else.\n\nBut their end should not have been to simply die like this.\n\nFeeling the surging aura from Lu Ding, Tang Bao looked at the white-skinned men patrolling the wharf below and asked Lu Ding, \"Patrol Officer Lu, what should we do now?\"\n\nLu Ding pressed the recording device on his chest to turn it off.\n\nThe video evidence of the cruise ship was now recorded, and the recorder should also be out of power.\n\nHe pointed one finger at the cruise ship: \"They died,\" then moved his finger down to point at the white-skinned men patrolling below to prevent outsiders from entering: \"Then they shouldn't be alive.\"\n\nA single thought pushed aside all others in Tang Bao's mind, taking precedence.\n\nIt was time to kill!\n\n---\n*   *Band together for warmth*: An idiom meaning to unite for mutual support or protection, especially in a difficult situation.\n*   *The pavilion closest to the water enjoys the moonlight first*: An idiom meaning that those in a favorable position or close proximity get the benefits or advantages first.\n*   *Their path has already narrowed*: An idiom meaning that someone has limited their options or is headed for trouble.\n*   *To help someone to the end, to send the Buddha to the Western Paradise*: An idiom meaning to see a task through to completion or to help someone all the way to the end.",

    "content": ".......\n\nThe wind whistled past his ears. Lu Ding was carrying him, swooping down towards the ground.\n\nHis body felt light.\n\nTang Bao fell to the ground.\n\nLu Ding was no longer beside him.\n\nHe looked ahead.\n\nHe saw Lu Ding grab a patrolman, rip off his limbs, and hurl him far towards the cruise ship.\n\nWith a thud, the resentful aura was stirred up and dispersed, engulfing the screaming person. It was the attack of those who had died tragically on the cruise ship.\n\nThis truly was a case of every wrong having its perpetrator, every debt its owner. Though the principal murderers weren't these people, they were accomplices.\n\nLu Ding's method of handling things was also an eye-opener for Tang Bao.\n\n749 doesn't seem to go for this, does it...?\n\nAlthough feeding living people to vengeful spirits would incite their ferocity.\n\nBut Tang Bao told himself, if he brought the people from the Five Viscera Life Society here, they could surely deal with this place together!\n\nThat's right!\n\nHe planned to contribute his part.\n\nClinging to power—that way of speaking is too crude. He was clearly cooperating with 749's law enforcement to protect the personal safety of other residents and citizens in Baofan District.\n\nHow busy 749's aftermath personnel must be.\n\nIf he could lend a hand, he would, to save them some trouble.\n\nHe pulled out his phone and yelled in the Five Viscera Life Society's group chat.\n\n【Tang Bao/Group Admin: Siblings who aren't asleep, wake up the sleeping siblings, grab your gear and get ready to work. Location: Cloud Sea Broken Bridge Wharf. Details: Deliverance for vengeful spirits and wandering souls, removal of malicious aura.】\n\nTang Bao didn't know that this very action of his would solidify his future status in Baofan District, and even in Yunhai.\n\nHe even secured himself an identity as Baofan District's adjunct aftermath personnel.\n\nOf course, these were all later developments.\n\nSoon, Lu Ding had dealt with everyone.\n\nIn front of the cruise ship, he was clutching the last person, a white man suspected to be the leader.\n\nThis person's gaze fell on the stars on Lu Ding's shoulder.\n\n\"7....749......\"\n\n\"You've got some eyesight. You can even recognize I'm a 749 investigator. As a reward, you get one more chance to leave a last word than them.\"\n\nLu Ding said, his tone placid.\n\n\"I... I'm not a Great Han citizen. I request... request to be repatriated... I should be subject to the White-headed Eagle's laws.\"\n\nThe man struggled to utter these words.\n\nLu Ding looked at him with eyes full of mockery, his tone questioning: \"Are you just growing a body without growing a brain? You're standing under the Great Han's sky, treading on the Great Han's land, helping kill Great Han people, and you're still thinking about a clean-up? Now you're telling me you should be punished by the White-headed Eagle's laws?\"\n\n\"The Management Law... that's how it's stipulated.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahaha, alright, alright.\" Lu Ding's laughter was unrestrained, and the seawater churned.\n\n\"Since you want to talk about the Management Law, fine. I'll put it another way. Now, I simply don't like the sight of you, and it's clear I'm going to kill you. What can you do? You can resist, and I can even give you the chance to resist. Come on, resist, resist!!!\"\n\nThe hand clutching his neck gradually tightened. Snap, crackle, bone-cracking sounds ceaselessly rang out, and blood spewed from his mouth and nose, rendering him speechless.\n\n\"If you have any complaints, feel free to sue me. As long as you can survive, I'll be waiting.\"\n\nA slicing strike horizontally cut him, and Lu Ding, holding one half in each hand, threw them onto the cruise ship.\n\nDeath was imminent.\n\nThe man stretched out his hands, flailing wildly in the air, and his last words drifted over.\n\n\"How can someone like you be a Great Han 749 investigator...?\"\n\nLu Ding crossed his arms: \"People like you are precisely the ones I need to deal with.\"\n\nSense of justice, Lu Ding had it. Sense of responsibility, Lu Ding had that too. So why couldn't he be a 749 investigator?\n\nPatriotism, he was very patriotic. From childhood to adulthood, he had received national welfare benefits.\n\nSo, may I ask, was there any problem with him being a 749 investigator?\n\nThese people, one after another, murdered and harmed lives, yet dared to demand so-called legal sanctions. For people like them, the 749 Qi Refiner Management Law explicitly states that in sudden incidents, investigators may act with discretion.\n\nFor Lu Ding, as long as he encountered it, it was always a \"sudden incident.\"\n\nYou dare to provoke me, and he dares to kill.\n\nAfter finishing up here, Yan Feifan and the main force of the Five Viscera Life Society had just arrived.\n\nLooking at these people.\n\nLu Ding was full of confusion: \"What are they doing?\"\n\n\"Patrol Officer Lu, weren't you going to report what happened here? I thought it might take some time for your 749 aftermath personnel to arrive. You surely have more important things to do right now. If you leave, the situation here will be hard to control, and if anything goes wrong, that would be a work error.\"\n\n\"The Five Viscera Life Society is a Qi Refiner force in Baofan District, and we should cooperate with your work. You can leave with peace of mind later; I'll handle all the aftermath. Patrol Officer Yan can stay here to supervise us, and when 749's aftermath personnel arrive later, he can report the situation.\"\n\nThey had thought of everything for Lu Ding, from every angle.\n\nAbsolutely not wasting an ounce of his time or efficiency.\n\nYan Feifan listened from the side, his expression somewhat grave.\n\nIn this day and age, why would anyone even fight over menial tasks?!\n\nYou're not even from 749, why are you so eager!\n\nAre you crazy!!!?\n\nIf you have a problem, go see a doctor. If you have nothing to do late at night, go back to sleep.\n\nSo smart, so considerate, are you trying to be a show-off? Are you trying to make yourself stand out!?\n\nHowever, for Lu Ding, this was indeed well thought out.\n\n\"Feifan, you stay here, wait for the aftermath personnel, and explain the situation to them. I'll personally submit the report later.\"\n\n\"Okay, Brother Lu. I've sent Jia Yuanfang's situation to your phone.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nLu Ding pulled out his phone, made a call, then stood up and flew off.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side.\n\nXingteng Capital.\n\nThis was also where Jia Yuanfang worked after returning to the country, a famous foreign enterprise in Yunhai.\n\nIn front of the floor-to-ceiling window, Jia Yuanfang was holding a wine glass, swirling red wine, and calling her son, Cao Yuan.\n\n\"Don't worry, Xiaoyuan, Mom has a sense of proportion. Do you have enough money to spend?\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, Mom knows.\"\n\nJia Yuanfang, who had just returned, felt an incessant unease. She had mostly heard about Lu Ding and didn't know much, but what she had heard was enough to make her restless. The people she had sent out hadn't yet heard from Tang Bao.\n\nAfter some thought, Jia Yuanfang decided to call her son, Cao Yuan, to ask about Lu Ding. As for why she didn't call her eldest son, Cao Zi'ang, it was because Cao Zi'ang was with 749, and he knew nothing about the things she was doing.\n\nIf she called him now and her eldest son found out, or if things were exposed, the consequences would be unimaginable.\n\nAfter much deliberation, she decided it would be better to call her younger son. Caos' Alley was conveniently in Baofan District, and they were a local power, so they surely knew a lot.\n\nAnd when she asked...\n\nThe news was mixed.\n\nThe good news was that Lu Ding had just killed Ye Feng in Caos' Alley tonight and also beaten Qiu Tianrang. Furthermore, Tang Hu from the Five Viscera Life Society had died by his hand, creating a blood feud with Tang Long and Tang Bao. And Lu Ding had gone to eat hotpot—he had personally said so when he left.\n\nThe bad news was that Qiu Tianrang, despite being a formal 749 investigator and possessing Spiritual Sea Realm cultivation, was not even a match for a single blow against Lu Ding.\n\nHanging up the phone, Jia Yuanfang thought to herself: \"Even if Tang Bao tells Lu Ding about the Broken Bridge Wharf incident, he'll probably go through some mental struggle, right? After all, Lu Ding killed his second brother, Tang Hu. The people I just sent out also said they found Tang Bao and cornered him. It should be fine, right...?\"\n\nWith several 'right?'s, Jia Yuanfang herself didn't believe these words. She knew in her heart that this was just her speculation, ultimately unreliable, and too far-fetched. It was barely enough for self-consolation.\n\n\"It seems I still need to quickly have people clean up the evidence at the wharf to ensure there's no proof!\"\n\nA white man in pajamas, leaning against the floor-to-ceiling window, called out to the contemplative Jia Yuanfang: \"Baby.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, I need to make another call.\"\n\nAs Jia Yuanfang spoke, she dialed the numbers of the people at the wharf. The result was a long string of 'dudus'—no one answered.\n\nJia Yuanfang's heart instantly sank to rock bottom.\n\nThe next second.\n\nWith a boom.\n\nThe exterior wall of the 60-story building shattered with a crash.\n\nThe figure on the phone walked in from high in the sky outside the sixtieth floor, as if strolling in a leisurely courtyard.\n\n\"Alright, good. Anyway, I've sent you the video footage. You can arrange things as you see fit. No, no, I won't go there alone recklessly. That explosion just now was just me getting angrier the more I thought about it, and I just casually kicked down a wall.\"",

    "content": "On the way here, Lu Ding had already reported the general situation of Yunhai Broken Bridge Pier to the 749 Dispatch Department.\n\nHe asked them to file and open a case.\n\nBy now, the basic situation had been explained clearly.\n\nOn the phone, someone from the 749 Dispatch Department was instructing him not to go alone rashly.\n\nBecause last time, during the Yin Domain Overlap incident, Lu Ding had gone in alone.\n\nThis time was different from last time. If it truly was a vampire count, Lu Ding going alone might startle the snake by beating the grass*.\n\nBecause a vampire count not only possessed strength comparable to at least the seventh or eighth stage of the Spirit Sea Realm and above, but could also fly.\n\nIn case it escaped, it would be difficult to find later. It was best to wait for support and daylight, then surround and kill it together.\n\nThe fact that Lu Ding could fly was known by quite a few people, but also unknown by many.\n\nIn any case, he had never reported it himself.\n\nPeople from the 749 Dispatch Department certainly knew he could fly, but they probably didn't imagine he could fly very fast.\n\nA Spirit Sea Realm cultivator who could fly was already quite incredible.\n\nIt was like a child not yet one year old who could run. Adults would give a thumbs-up and praise, \"This child is amazing, running before they're even one year old, that's truly rare, maybe they'll be a talent for sports in the future.\"\n\nWould you imagine a child under one year old running faster than Usain Bolt?\n\n\"Alright, alright, gotta go, I have something going on here.\"\n\n\"Inspector Lu, please, absolutely do not act impulsively!\"\n\n\"Oh, I know.\"\n\nThe call ended.\n\nLu Ding looked at Baipi, who had a 'what the f***' expression, and Jia Yuanfang, who was quietly pacing, trying to escape. He said, \"Sorry to interrupt your fun. Let me introduce myself, my name is Lu Ding. I'm a probationary investigator with the 749 Investigation Bureau, and also the Inspector for Baofan District.\"\n\n\"So...\"\n\nLu Ding looked at the two who made no move: \"Are you ready to run?\"\n\nBaipi turned and ran.\n\nTwo steps out, his head flew off, his body remaining in place.\n\nLu Ding stepped forward, step by step. In the quiet room, his footsteps seemed to tread on Jia Yuanfang's heart, suppressing her heartbeat.\n\n\"Why aren't you running?\"\n\nJia Yuanfang's expression was dejected; \"Run? What's the use of running? If anyone could escape from you face-to-face, Yuan Baifeng wouldn't have died, Ye Xuan wouldn't have died, Huang Zuo wouldn't have died, and neither Ye Feng nor Tang Hu would have died.\"\n\nLu Ding glanced at her. Had she already investigated him behind his back?\n\n\"You know me quite well. Since you know all this, how dare you cause such trouble in my jurisdiction?\"\n\n\"I just gambled on luck*.\"\n\nAs Jia Yuanfang spoke, she walked towards a nearby stool, about to sit down.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand, channeled Qi, and slapped her, sending her flying.\n\n*Smack*!!!\n\nThe slap sent Jia Yuanfang spinning several times in the air before she fell heavily to the ground.\n\n\"I didn't tell you to sit. Your death is imminent, great disaster looms, and you still want to show off your demeanor and elegance as a strong woman? What are you pretending to be?\"\n\n\"A mountain collapses before you, yet your face remains unchanged?\"\n\nJia Yuanfang wiped the blood from her mouth horizontally, truly looking at Lu Ding without changing her expression: \"Inspector Lu, won't you even grant me my last shred of dignity?\"\n\n\"What *are* you?\"\n\nLu Ding squinted at her: \"Dignity? Do you even deserve dignity? There was no dignity for the hundreds of lives lost on that cruise ship.\"\n\n\"I'll talk, you answer. If you understand, we'll talk here. Once you've told me what I want to hear, you'll wait for people from the Bureau to come and take you back, to properly explain why you brought a vampire to Yunhai.\"\n\n\"If you don't understand, I also have some soul-shattering methods* and the Ten Great Tortures that I wouldn't mind trying on you one by one.\"\n\nJia Yuanfang gave a self-deprecating smile.\n\nShe simply threw caution to the wind* and sat on the ground without getting up: \"Inspector Lu, I'll tell you whatever you want to hear, but I have only one request: don't go looking for trouble for my two sons. I beg you, even if 749 needs to find them later, please don't go yourself.\"\n\nJia Yuanfang, the ex-wife of Cao Jianshu, the head of the Second Branch of Cao Family Alley. Years ago, unable to endure Cao Jianshu's domestic violence, she abandoned her two sons and left for abroad.\n\nLater, she met some influential people abroad and, through diplomatic means, finally reached a divorce agreement with Cao Jianshu.\n\nAlthough she no longer felt any affection for Cao Jianshu.\n\nHer two sons, however, were her own. When she left, Cao Yuan was only a few years old.\n\nOver the years, she had always felt indebted to them.\n\nShe had also investigated Lu Ding; his consistent principle was to eliminate root and branch*, acting decisively and ruthlessly.\n\nIf he went, Cao Yuan would surely die. As for Cao Zi'ang, that was unknown, as he was also a 749 investigator.\n\nIf Cao Yuan's matter were to leak and another investigator went, at most he'd be caught and handed over to 749 for trial. Cao Yuan would still have a chance to live.\n\nAs for Lu Ding...\n\nWherever he caught someone was the courtroom, and wherever he caught someone was the execution ground.\n\nRegarding her words, Lu Ding recalled the messages sent by the Dispatch Department and forwarded by Yan Feifan on the way here.\n\nCombining the two.\n\nThis Cao Family Alley indeed had some complications* within it.\n\nFor 749, this might not be a big deal.\n\nBut for ordinary people, this was already a serious crime.\n\n[Upon verification, Cao Yuan, the young master of Cao Family Alley, was found to be smuggling antique funerary objects overseas.]\n\nIt wasn't known before because this matter was not big for 749, there was nothing to investigate, and no direction. Who would have known he was smuggling funerary objects?\n\nThis was a matter for the Public Security Administration Bureau.\n\n749 was busy every day containing monsters and slaying demonic cultivators; they barely had enough time for that, let alone investigating this.\n\nNow, because Jia Yuanfang was Cao Yuan's mother, the original intention was to investigate Jia Yuanfang. As a result, with this investigation, it didn't even take much effort, and Cao Family Alley's trivial problems directly surfaced.\n\nSince a whole bunch of things had now come together.\n\nLu Ding would definitely handle it as one single matter.\n\nHe said casually.\n\n\"You have a stereotype of me.\"\n\n\"As for whether I go after Cao Yuan, that depends on whether what you say is what I want to hear.\"\n\nThese words were ambiguous. That's right, Lu Ding was deceiving her; she deserved it.\n\nWhen dealing with such people, should one still talk about credibility and morality with them?\n\nShe herself was not a person who possessed credibility and morality.\n\nJia Yuanfang smiled: \"I believe you, Inspector Lu.\"\n\nLu Ding also smiled: No need for this subtle moral blackmail. I'm very double-standard when it comes to people; you're not within my scope of trust.\n\n\"Ask, Inspector Lu.\"\n\n\"Where's the vampire?\"\n\nLu Ding asked the question that was on his mind. The Flying Bear Pouncing Technique was useful, but it wasn't omnipotent. If you deliberately isolated your own scent and left no trace, then you wouldn't be able to smell it.\n\nCoincidentally, vampires, priding themselves as nobles, behave elegantly and leave no scent wherever they go.\n\nTheir habits were pretty damn good.\n\nThis annoyed Lu Ding greatly. Otherwise, why would he waste words with this Jia Yuanfang?\n\nHe would have acted long ago.\n\n\"The basement, right in the basement of this building. Inspector Lu, do you have the ability to take down Count Fidel?\"\n\n*Smack*!!!\n\nAnother slap sent her flying again.\n\n\"Talking to me in that tone, anyone who didn't know would think we were very familiar.\"\n\nThis time, Lu Ding's strike was heavier; he directly knocked Jia Yuanfang unconscious and instilled a stream of Spirit Qi to cut off her consciousness.\n\nUnless someone was stronger than Lu Ding, forcing a breakthrough would only cause the Spirit Qi to rampage, shattering the person's brain.\n\n---\n*   **startle the snake by beating the grass (打草惊蛇)**: An idiom meaning to inadvertently alert an enemy or opponent.\n*   **gambled on luck (心存侥幸)**: Literally \"to harbor a fluke mentality.\" Meaning to act with a shred of hope or to gamble on luck, despite the odds.\n*   **soul-shattering methods (杀人诛心)**: Literally \"to kill the person and punish their heart/spirit.\" An idiom meaning to attack someone's morale, reputation, or deeply held beliefs; to psychologically destroy them.\n*   **threw caution to the wind (破罐子破摔)**: Literally \"a broken pot is abandoned and smashed.\" An idiom meaning to give up on oneself entirely, to act recklessly because things are already bad, or to throw caution to the wind.\n*   **eliminate root and branch (斩草除根)**: Literally \"to cut the grass and pull out the roots.\" An idiom meaning to eliminate a problem or enemy thoroughly, leaving no trace.\n*   **complications (弯弯绕绕)**: Literally \"twists and turns.\" Meaning complex, intricate, or full of complications.",

    "content": "......\n\nConfinement Cell 749.\n\nThe iron door slid open. A long-haired youth sat cross-legged on the bed.\n\nSomeone walked in from outside.\n\n\"Hemian, ah, you can't be so impulsive next time. Now, there's a mission I've managed to get for you, a chance to redeem yourself. I've sent the mission details to your phone, take a look for yourself. Make sure you handle it, and handle it beautifully, understand?\"\n\nDirector Deng Guofu stepped out from the shadows.\n\nBai Hemian rolled off the bed, his true appearance revealed as he stepped out of the darkness. He had a head of long, waterfall-like hair, a cold and grim aura, a black shirt, black pants, and black shoes, all with patterns.\n\nIt was less like the attire of a living person, and more like grave clothes.\n\nA jade-green light flashed in his eyes.\n\nA living person, a living corpse—he had the aura of both, intertwined and tangled. To call him either one alone would be incorrect.\n\nBai Hemian took the phone.\n\n\"Lu Ding?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lu Ding. He's just like you, a great kid. You two get along, don't cause any trouble.\"\n\nSpeaking of Lu Ding, Director Deng's smile was kindly.\n\nBai Hemian put the phone away. \"Don't worry. I'll be going then. You should take care of yourself, too.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. When you're out there, remember not to be impulsive, don't just kill people randomly, and especially don't kill your teammates.\"\n\nThese words all but spelled out the reason for Bai Hemian's confinement.\n\nKilling his teammates.\n\nBai Hemian's previous mission was a team mission: to capture an escaped, wanted Qi Refiner.\n\nThat Qi Refiner had committed crimes elsewhere, killing many people, before hiding out in a village. He hid there for many years and even became the village chief.\n\nLater, when Bai Hemian and his team tracked him down, the entire village begged them to let the Qi Refiner go.\n\nThis point alone was enough to prove that the man must have done a lot of good for the village over the years.\n\nAfter some discussion, someone on the team suggested they just let it go. It had been so many years; if they reported that he had died of old age, their superiors probably wouldn't investigate further.\n\nBut Bai Hemian held the opposite view.\n\n\"If the people he killed before deserved to die, then fine. I'd be subjectively willing to let him go.\"\n\n\"If he were my closest friend, then fine. I could break the rules and let him go, then return to accept my punishment myself, saying that loyalty and duty cannot both be satisfied.\"\n\n\"But he's not my friend, and among the people he killed were so many ordinary people. No matter how much good he's doing now, a killer is a killer. We let him go, but did he let those people go? We accepted the mission, so we have to do the job. If you weren't going to do it, why did you accept the mission in the first place?\"\n\nOnce these words were spoken, the atmosphere instantly became tense.\n\nThen, unsurprisingly, an argument broke out.\n\nBai Hemian got annoyed.\n\nHe directly killed the two who insisted on letting the man go, right then and there.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the world became harmonious.\n\nHe came back, dutifully submitted the mission and the report, and settled into the confinement cell.\n\nOnly now was he breathing fresh air again.\n\n.....\n\nXingteng Capital, outer basement corridor.\n\nA dozen or so security guards were on patrol. Whoa, tall, powerfully built, well-equipped—they really looked the part.\n\nActually, they were nothing special.\n\nLu Ding couldn't figure it out. You're a capital group, making tens of millions in minutes, so why not hire some Qi Refiners to patrol? Are you just putting on a show with a bunch of regular guys to fool yourselves?\n\nThis is your damn den. Anyone who can fight their way here isn't going to be stopped by a dozen regular guys, are they?\n\nAnd now there's a vampire living deep inside this place.\n\nAnother dim-witted one.\n\nExpecting a bunch of regular guys to patrol for you, to handle security and alerts. Are you plugging your ears while stealing a bell¹, or just trying to comfort yourself?\n\n\"Captain, I think I saw a shadow flying.\"\n\nIn the quiet outer corridor, a man spoke uncertainly into his walkie-talkie.\n\nSee?\n\nLu Ding was practically flying in his face, and the guy was still stuck on \"I think.\"\n\nWhat's the point of hiring them?\n\nLu Ding ignored him and floated straight past. The man only heard a hum, like an electronic device hit by a pulse attack, and in an instant, his vision went black as his internal motherboard failed and he passed out.\n\nAnd that was with Lu Ding using only a tiny bit of the Drumbeat Heart-shaking Technique's power.\n\nWalking down the corridor, listening to the sounds coming from behind the wall, Lu Ding could only think: \"Guess money can't buy everything after all. The soundproofing in a place like this is actually this terrible. Isn't this just tofu-dreg construction?\"\n\nOn the other side of the wall was a spacious, luxuriously decorated, completely sealed room.\n\nIt was illuminated by a dim red light.\n\nOn a soft bed several meters wide, several naked forms were strewn about.\n\nThe vampire, with skin so pale it was eerie, flew up, wrapped himself in his clothes, and hung himself in the upper corner above the only entrance.\n\nLu Ding had detected him through the wall, and likewise, he had detected Lu Ding.\n\nAfter all, Lu Ding wasn't concealing his presence; he was basically making a grand entrance.\n\n\"A strong human, an Eastern Qi Refiner, delicious blood...\"\n\nThe noble Count Fidel used his 'brilliant' brain to come up with a flawless, preemptive plan.\n\nAn ambush!\n\nThe moment the person outside comes through this main door, he will pounce and kill him, draining his blood dry!!\n\nAt this thought, Count Fidel licked his crimson lips. His two sharp fangs couldn't help but lengthen, his eyes glowing with the same dim red light as the room.\n\nBut imagination is a beautiful thing, and reality is cruel.\n\nOnly people who play by the rules use the main door.\n\nLu Ding doesn't even use doors to get to the 60th floor; what made you think he'd politely use the door to the basement?\n\nBOOM!!!!!\n\nThe wall collapsed with a roar, sending rubble tumbling everywhere.\n\nLu Ding floated in amidst the dust.\n\nCount Fidel twisted his head to look at the breach. \"Eastern Qi Refiner, you certainly have an unconventional way of doing things.\"\n\n\"Oh my god, Western vampire, that textbook translated accent of yours is just criminal.\"\n\nCount Fidel shifted his posture in the corner. \"Ha~ ha~ ha~ You wound me. But no matter, Mr. Qi Refiner. I will savor the blood in your body, just as I would savor a fine, full-bodied wine!\"\n\nIn his vision, Lu Ding's heartbeat was extremely powerful, and currents of blood, carrying flecks of golden light, were being pumped from his heart throughout his body.\n\nHe had never seen blood of such high quality.\n\nThe vampire lunged, preparing to test Lu Ding's skills.\n\nBut who would have known? Lu Ding floated off the ground, raised a hand, and in an instant, razor-sharp slashes filled the entire room. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, the expensive crystal chandelier, the ten-million-dollar rare wood bed—everything was shredded to dust in the blink of an eye.\n\nIncluding, of course, Count Fidel's body.\n\nBefore his body was torn to pieces and turned into chunks the size of a chopstick tip, his eyes were filled with shock!!!!\n\nThis wasn't how he'd imagined it. Weren't they supposed to probe each other first, learn the strengths and weaknesses of their fighting styles, and then attack accordingly? They had never met before; wasn't he afraid that he might have some strange, esoteric technique that could counter his main offensive ability?\n\nTo this, the calm expression on Lu Ding's face seemed to be his answer.\n\n*Do I need to probe?*\n\n***\n\n¹A Chinese idiom (`掩耳盜鈴`) meaning to deceive oneself; to bury one's head in the sand.

    "content": ".....\n\nMagic, Body, Speed.\n\nRespectively representing magical arts, physical body, and speed. Pick whichever you like.\n\nJust start fighting. Who needs all that complicated nonsense?\n\nIf you wanted to compete with magical treasures, this Lu Ding really didn't have any, but he considered his own body to be a magical treasure in its own right.\n\nHe watched the shattered pieces of Count Fedel scattered across the floor.\n\nLu Ding just looked at them.\n\nOne second... two seconds... three seconds...\n\n\"Fuck, why won't this damned Eastern Qi Refiner leave? Didn't you already kill me!?\"\n\nCount Fedel was not dead.\n\nHe wasn't that easy to kill. He was a vampire, after all; it was normal for his life force to be a bit more tenacious.\n\nOnce upon a time, when he traveled to countries like Chenla, Annam, and Zhubo, it was this very ability that allowed him to deceive his opponents and escape many life-or-death crises.\n\nOriginally, Fedel hadn't been too afraid of this Eastern Qi Refiner, Lu Ding.\n\nBut this man was too confident, and he struck too decisively.\n\nMoreover, this was not his country. If things blew up, he would be the one to suffer in the end.\n\nAnd so.\n\nHe had decided to play along, faking his death to trick Lu Ding.\n\nAfter all, by common sense, who could possibly survive being shattered into so many pieces?\n\nBut today, his ever-successful trick had failed.\n\nWhen it came to whether a monster was dead or alive, Lu Ding never judged by sight or feeling.\n\n*I haven't gotten my reward yet. Who are you trying to fool, pretending to be ground meat?!*\n\nSeeing that he couldn't hide, Fedel cursed \"dammit\" in his heart. The scattered pieces of flesh on the ground then reconverged into a human figure.\n\n\"Can you tell me how you saw that I was not yet dead? As a reward, you may choose a gentler way to die.\"\n\nAt first, Lu Ding could understand, but the further he spoke, the more confused Lu Ding became. Was this man still speaking Chinese?\n\nHe wiggled two fingers, as if beckoning a dog. \"Here, come over and I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahaha, you Eastern Qi Refiner, you truly are too...\"\n\n*Vwommm...*\n\nA sound wave, visible to the naked eye, radiated out from Lu Ding, heading straight for the vampire's heart.\n\nDrumbeat Heart-shaking Technique!!!\n\nThe moment the frequency of the sound wave synchronized with the frequency of the vampire's heartbeat.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nA large hole exploded in Count Fedel's chest.\n\nCoughing up a mouthful of blood, the vampire staggered backward.\n\n\"You sneak-attacked me again!!!!!!!!\"\n\nSharp fangs extended. This time, he was truly angry.\n\n\"Idiot. Did you think I was here to play games with you? If you like to talk so much, go on, say a few more words. I'm also very curious just how many times I have to kill you before you die for good.\"\n\nHe raised his hand, and another slashing attack raged forth like a tempest.\n\nThe vampire's figure flickered, continuously dodging the attacks.\n\n\"I see now, I see! The great Count Fedel understands! Although your physical body is formidable, it is somewhat weaker than your attainments in magical arts, which is why you keep using magic to blast the noble Count Fedel!!!!!\"\n\n\"In comparison, your physical body is your weak point!!!\"\n\nFedel felt he had discovered the blind spot!\n\n*That's it, that must be it!!!*\n\nThe physical body of the man before him was formidable, yes, but compared to his magic, his magic must be even more formidable! Otherwise, why wouldn't he use his body to attack, but instead use magic?\n\nIn the words of the Great Han, wasn't this grasping the minor and neglecting the major?¹\n\nAlthough it was hard to accept, Count Fedel had to admit that this Eastern Qi Refiner's magic was far too terrifying, both in its power and its casting speed.\n\nIt was all beyond his reach.\n\nBut in a physical contest, he was a vampire, an elegant noble of the night. There was no way he could be weaker than a lowly human.\n\nSuddenly, the dim room was flooded with a bloody light.\n\nThe vampire darted and weaved between the corners, finally charging in front of Lu Ding, a pair of wings unfurling from his back.\n\nHis expression was savage.\n\n\"In the name of the noble Count Fedel, I grant you death!!!!\"\n\nHis hand, like a blade, carried a scarlet glow as it chopped straight for Lu Ding's head.\n\nThis move, he had used it countless times to take countless heads. Like his previous tactic of playing dead, four words were enough to describe it: always successful!\n\n*Crack!!!*\n\nWith a crisp sound, his wrist was casually caught in a grasp.\n\nLu Ding looked up, the disdain in his eyes deeply imprinted upon Fedel's heart through his own.\n\n\"I am indeed proficient in magical arts, but I never said that my body is weaker than my magic. And what makes you think I was using my full strength when I hit you with magic? Is it because I insta-killed you twice in a row with it?\"\n\nLu Ding shook his head slightly. \"It was only because it's my first time seeing a vampire, so I found it novel. More than that, it's because I wanted to torture you, you garbage.\"\n\n*Rrrrip!!!!!*\n\nWith brute force, Lu Ding tore one of Count Fedel's arms from his body.\n\nThe excruciating pain struck again.\n\nEven as his body was grabbed by Lu Ding and slammed heavily onto the ground, feeling the hard floor beneath him crack and splinter, Count Fedel's mind was still echoing with Lu Ding's deeply insulting words.\n\n\"More than that, it's because I wanted to torture you, you garbage...\"\n\nTorture... being diced into mincemeat was indeed physical torture.\n\nHis heart being crushed and exploded inside his body was also torture.\n\nBut none of it could compare to the damage done by having his dignity trampled underfoot.\n\nThe \"noble\" Count Fedel felt like a joke.\n\nAll his clever analysis and confidence were, in this moment, crushed to pulp.\n\nThen, Lu Ding's voice rang out again.\n\n\"Now, in the name of Lu Ding, Patrol Officer of Baofan District and Trainee Investigator of 749, I grant you death!\"\n\nThe same words, now spoken by Lu Ding, sounded even more insulting to Fedel. Just a moment ago, he had uttered that line with such brazen arrogance, but the situation had reversed in an instant.\n\nThe positions of judge and judged had been switched.\n\nHow ironic was that?\n\n\"I won't die! You can't kill me!!! I am the noble Count Fedel!!!!!\"\n\n*Bang!!! Bang bang bang bang!!!!*\n\nGrabbing him by the foot, Lu Ding swung Fedel's body around, repeatedly smashing it into the ground. The immense power made it impossible for him to escape.\n\nFinally, he was hurled up to the ceiling.\n\nLu Ding leaped up after him.\n\nHis fists were like a continuous barrage of cannonballs, hammering Fedel's body.\n\nBones shattered, internal organs were displaced. A destructive Spiritual Qi followed the force of the blows into his body, churning up his existence on a deeper level.\n\nHis soul!\n\nUnder the unbearable load, Fedel's soul let out a pained wail.\n\nThe agony made him scream, the agony made him furious, the agony made him struggle, and the agony also made him clear-headed!\n\nFeeling the ceiling behind him long since shattered, with dirt and soil tumbling down to the floor, a thought suddenly struck Fedel: this was the basement. Outside, it was already day, the sun was shining...\n\n\"No!! No!!! You can't do this!!! You can't!!! I killed people!! I did evil!! I should receive my due punishment! I should receive judgment from 749!!!\"\n\n\"Hahahahahaha, noble Count Fedel, come on! Scream! Beg for mercy! Let out your pained wails and compose the final chapter of your life!!\"\n\nLu Ding, in his wild frenzy, turned a deaf ear. Noble? Noble, my ass!!\n\nWith thousands of years of civilization passed down, you could take a look on the streets these days, randomly ask someone for their surname, and trace it back through history—how many of them *weren't* descended from kings and generals?\n\nA noble? The living corpse he'd dealt with a few days ago, *that* was a bona fide noble, a general.\n\nFedel screamed from the pain, then roared in anger from the fear of the approaching sunlight, \"Maniac! Maniac!!!\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes! Just like that! Conduct the symphony of your life's final countdown! See your self-proclaimed nobility and elegance through to the very end! Hahahahahaha...!!!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Grasping the minor and neglecting the major*: The original text uses the idiom 捨本逐末 (shěběnzhúmò), which means to focus on trivialities while ignoring the fundamentals. Fedel believes Lu Ding is using his more powerful skill (magic), thus hiding his \"fundamental\" weakness (his physical body).",

    "content": "In the center of the building complex.\n\nThe nascent morning sun slid down a corner of the high-rise, its light shining upon the ground, warming this patch of land that had just emerged from the darkness.\n\nJust then, a mound of earth arched upward.\n\nWas it the incubation of new life?\n\nNo!\n\nIt was the arrival of death.\n\nBang!!\n\nTwo figures burst from underground, kicking up bricks and soil.\n\nFeeling the sunlight's warmth, Lu Ding was comfortable.\n\nCount Fedel's situation, however, was not so good. He... was smoking.\n\nThe warm sunlight struck his body like the first snow meeting a warm sun, melting him inch by inch.\n\nBlack smoke rose from his back.\n\nChunks of flesh and skin turned to black smoke and dissipated.\n\nA large hand shot out and locked around his neck.\n\nLu Ding floated in the air.\n\nIn his grip, Count Fedel screamed and struggled endlessly.\n\n\"Aargh!!! Don't... don't let the sun shine directly on me!!! You lowly Eastern Qi Cultivator!!!\"\n\nWatching him struggle ceaselessly in his hand, Lu Ding held him high by the neck, not swaying in the slightest, allowing Count Fedel to be wantonly bathed in the sunlight. He even flipped him over from time to time to ensure he was evenly cooked.\n\n\"Hahahahahahaha, what warm sunlight, Count Fedel. You've never felt it before, have you? Today, you'll feel it properly. Let me listen to your melodious screams.\"\n\nHoisting a vampire into the sun was almost equivalent to grabbing a person by the neck and roasting them over a blazing fire.\n\nWhy \"almost\"?\n\nBecause the damage sunlight inflicted on a vampire was far more lethal, and far more painful, than that of a raging fire on human flesh.\n\nYes.\n\nLu Ding could have dealt with him through many other means.\n\nBut why let him die so cleanly?\n\nHow boring would that be?\n\nIn a tedious life, one must always find interesting ways to approach things.\n\n\"Investigator\" was Lu Ding's job.\n\nHe was quite fond of his job.\n\nWhenever these wantonly cruel monsters screamed and shrieked in his grasp, Lu Ding would feel from the bottom of his heart: this job is absolutely fantastic!!\n\nHide. Just keep hiding. For nineteen years!!\n\nHaving a system¹ he couldn't use was like receiving a job offer from a top-tier company that never tells you to come in and complete the onboarding process. Every day you wait for their notice, but they always tell you, \"Don't rush, don't rush, we'll call you.\"\n\nEvery day, while struggling to make a living, he also had to hold out hope for the future, because: *I have a system, I'm a transmigrator, I was born extraordinary!! I'm the shit!*\n\nBut reality just kept striking him down, day after day, telling him, \"Your system is useless. Where are the monsters?\"\n\nTo give a person hope, and then use reality to tell that person that hope is slim, that hope is next to nothing.\n\nTo put it in a philosophical way: I could have endured the darkness, had I not seen the light.\n\nIf Lu Ding had been a simple, ordinary person transmigrated with only his memories, he could have lived very well relying on the memories and experiences of his past life.\n\nInstead, he was an orphan in a swaddling cloth who knew from the very beginning that he possessed a system, forced to languish alone in this world with his worldview and cognition already set.\n\nBut all that is in the past.\n\nWith no time to mourn a mundane history, making his debut now is: the transmigrator, wielder of the Monster Containment Prison system, the rapid climber to the summit, 749's intern investigator, he who is nicknamed the Corpse-Carving Grand Duke, Lu~~~~~Ding!!!!\n\nPow!!!\n\nHe squeezed.\n\nScorched by the sun, Count Fedel reached the end of his life in Lu Ding's hand.\n\nBlack smoke drifted away.\n\n\"My apologies, oh noble~ Count Fedel, for making your death so undignified. There's no Underworld or Heaven here, only legends of Hell. Dying in the lands of Han, you'll need to walk the Yellow Springs Road, cross the Bridge of Helplessness, ascend the Home-Gazing Terrace, and then drink a bowl of Meng Po's Soup.\"\n\n\"Remember, when you're on the Home-Gazing Terrace, don't you go thinking about that broken-down homeland of yours. Remember to take a look at the still-brilliant me. My name is Lu Ding. In this life, I am the one who killed you.\"\n\n\"Noble? Hahahahahahahahaha...\"\n\nLu Ding found the word increasingly hilarious. A noble whose bones had ceased to exist.\n\n【Monster Contained: Vampire】\n【Containment Reward: Blood Rain Technique】\n【Blood Rain Technique: A rain of blood from the heavens is an omen, a taboo. Scatter a rain of blood to command a domain. Within the blood rain, you are king.】\n\nLogically, the system prompt should have ended there.\n\nBut this time, not only did the notification panel not disappear, but new words also materialized.\n\n【Wind Fixing Technique, in position. Blood Rain Technique, in position.】\n\nThe words representing the two techniques began to fade and merge, and finally, a brand-new technique appeared.\n\n【Technique: Foul Wind and Bloody Rain²】\n【Your arrival is always accompanied by a foul wind and a bloody rain. The wind stirs the three *hun* and seven *po* souls³; the rain dissolves flesh and bone.】\n\nLooking at the new technique, Lu Ding knew he had grown stronger again.\n\nSunlight scattered in golden rays.\n\nLu Ding shot up from the ground, straight to the sixtieth floor, grabbed Jia Yuanfang, and flew off into the distance.\n\nThe vampire business was handled. The next thing to deal with was Cao Yuan of Cao Family Alley.\n\nThe crime of trafficking nether artifacts wasn't major, but it wasn't minor either.\n\nGrave robbers of all stripes were a group severely prosecuted under Han law.\n\nBut for Qi Cultivators, this was an unavoidable part of life. Delving into the earth for objects, entering mountains for treasures—many Qi Cultivators relied on this line of work to eat.\n\nSo, in the legal codes governing Qi Cultivators and ordinary people, the sentencing guidelines for this were slightly different.\n\nIf the deceased was a Qi Cultivator and you, as a Qi Cultivator, robbed the tomb, it was considered survival of the fittest. The Qi Cultivator circle would handle it internally, so long as it didn't endanger ordinary people.\n\nIf the deceased was an ordinary person, and you, a Qi Cultivator, went and robbed an ordinary person's tomb...\n\nThen you could wait for your jail cell.\n\nThe first principle for Qi Cultivators: Under no circumstances are you to harm the rights and interests of ordinary people.\n\nThe two circles, the two worlds, must be kept completely separate.\n\nThis was to prevent Qi Cultivators from leeching off ordinary people, from sucking their blood to live.\n\nIf it weren't strictly regulated, just imagine: you're a billionaire sleeping at home when suddenly, one day, you sense someone in your room.\n\nYou open your eyes to find a young man standing by your bed, saying, \"I'm short on cash right now. Give me money, give me money, give me money...\"\n\nYou call him a lunatic, and he says you're ungrateful and stubborn.\n\nYou think, *I'm a big-shot boss, and someone dares to rob me?*\n\nBut then he, a Qi Cultivator, casts some spells on you, and your vast fortune is \"voluntarily\" transferred.\n\nA lifetime of hard work, gone in a flash before you've even gotten old.\n\nWhat's the point of ordinary people even living then?\n\nThey'd all become leeks to be harvested.⁴\n\nUltimately, the root of Qi Cultivators is ordinary people. Only by protecting the rights of ordinary people can a continuous stream of new Qi Cultivators be produced.\n\nThis was one of the reasons for 749's existence.\n\nThis trafficking of nether artifacts from Cao Family Alley was a case of destroying the harmony and boundary between ordinary people and Qi Cultivators.\n\nMoreover, he was selling them abroad.\n\nIt wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it collaborating with the enemy and betraying the country.\n\nWhat are nether artifacts?\n\nCultural relics!\n\nIf they're lying in the ground, so be it; we don't go around casually digging up people's ancestral graves. After all, if you dig up theirs, you can't guarantee your own ancestral grave won't be dug up in the future.\n\nBut if they've come out, we should seize them when we can. If we really can't, if they go undiscovered, the worst-case scenario is that they circulate within the country. At its core, it's still in the country. But you sent it abroad. What are your intentions!?\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **System:** The original term is 金手指 (jīn shǒuzhǐ), literally \"gold finger.\" It's a common term in Chinese web fiction for a special power or \"cheat\" given to a protagonist, especially one who has traveled to another world.\n2.  **Foul Wind and Bloody Rain:** The original is 腥風血雨 (xīngfēngxuèyǔ), a Chinese idiom meaning \"a reign of terror\" or \"a bloodbath.\" The translation is literal to show how it combines the \"Wind\" and \"Blood Rain\" techniques.\n3.  ***Hun* and *Po* Souls:** In Daoist and Chinese folk belief, the human soul is composed of multiple parts.

    "content": "......\n\nCraving some seaweed and egg drop soup, are we? The kind with no seaweed, no \"egg flower,\"¹ and no soup. Just a purple egg.\n\nLu Ding took out his phone and dialed Gao Zhengliang's number.\n\n\"Hey, Old Gao.\"\n\n\"So early in the morning. What can I do for you, Investigator Lu?\"\n\n\"Time to get up and arrest some people.\"\n\nGao Zhengliang was sipping his congee.\n\nHearing this, he put down his spoon. \"Arrest people? Arrest who? What's the charge? Where?\"\n\nThis rapid-fire series of questions instantly drew the attention of the other public security officers in the cafeteria. Their gazes all turned to fix on Gao Zhengliang.\n\nThey all had the same thought.\n\nThis must be a major case!!!!\n\nOrdinary cases wouldn't be relayed through Gao Zhengliang. He was the bureau chief; only major, high-priority cases would be passed down through him.\n\nWhile sending the intel from 749 to Gao Zhengliang, Lu Ding said, \"Location is Caojia Alley. The targets include, but are not limited to, the names of the Cao clan members on the file I'm sending you.\"\n\nGao Zhengliang glanced at his phone.\n\nHe saw names like Cao Jianshu, Cao Yuan, and Cao Yutang on the file, and his head instantly started to throb.\n\nCao Jianshu, head of the Cao family's second branch. Cao Yuan, the current young master of Caojia Alley. Cao Yutang, head of the first branch and also the grand master of Caojia Alley—as well as Cao Ying's father.\n\nThe way things worked in Caojia Alley was that they valued merit over kinship.\n\nElections for any position had to go through evaluations based on contributions, skill competitions, and other assessments.\n\nThat was what had led to the current situation.\n\nThe grand master was from the first branch, while the young master was from the second.\n\nWhen Lu Ding saw all this, he had thought to himself, *Keeping pace with the modern era, you motherfuckers are pretty damn democratic.*\n\n\"Investigator Lu, this is no joke. That long list of names you sent—those are all direct descendants of the Cao family's second branch. Most of them are Qi Refiners. It's against protocol for me to go there.\"\n\nHis Bureau of Public Security managed ordinary people.\n\nWhat business did they have arresting Qi Refiners?\n\nWasn't that your job at 749?\n\n\"Just go. You're arresting people for trafficking netherworld artifacts. At the end of the day, that falls under your Bureau of Public Security's jurisdiction. Old Gao, you have to cooperate with law enforcement. If you're really afraid of them violently resisting arrest, then do this.\"\n\n\"Get the rocket launchers, anti-materiel sniper rifles, explosives, grenades, and whatever else you have in your armory, and have them surround Caojia Alley completely.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking you to lead your men in to arrest anyone. You just evacuate the civilians. I'll handle everything. I'll clear the field, and then you'll move in to secure the suspects.\"\n\n\"Finally, I'll need to borrow your facility for a bit while we wait for 749 to send vehicles to pick them up.\"\n\n\"Catching one person makes you a captor of an artifact trafficker. This is a whole group. Think of the credit to your record, Old Gao!!!!\"\n\n\"It's being handed to you on a platter and you're turning it down!?\"\n\nGao Zhengliang was persuaded by Lu Ding's words. It was true, what he said sounded right, and the file looked legitimate.\n\nThat meant the secret dealings of Caojia Alley were almost certainly true.\n\nIn that case, arresting them didn't seem wrong either.\n\nAnd if nothing was wrong with it, then the job seemed doable.\n\nIt was just that the procedures and paperwork seemed a little off.\n\nGao Zhengliang thought for a moment.\n\nSo what if he had to write a report afterward? Fuck it, he'd do it. The worst that could happen was he'd have to brew some strong tea and write all night.\n\n\"Investigator Lu, I'm only agreeing because I trust you. Don't you dare screw me over.\"\n\n\"Relax, Old Gao. Why would I ever screw you over?\"\n\nGao Zhengliang hung up the phone. \"Emergency assembly!!!\"\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, at the Xingteng Capital headquarters.\n\nDarkness swept in, and Bai Hemian emerged from it, looking at the utter mess on the ground.\n\nHe took two steps forward.\n\nHe lightly touched the black ash on the floor.\n\n\"It's over? This fast?\"\n\nHe had never heard of Lu Ding, nor did he know him, because he had been in solitary confinement. But the file sent from the bureau contained Lu Ding's glorious combat record, which gave even Bai Hemian pause—though only for a moment.\n\nBut now, the death of the vampire count made Bai Hemian realize with a start that this man was probably stronger than he had imagined.\n\n\"So, where did he go?\"\n\n***\n\nCaojia Alley.\n\nCao Yuan had tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep. They say a mother and son's hearts are connected, and ever since that phone call from his mom in the middle of the night, he was even more sleepless.\n\nThoughts grew like wild weeds in his mind.\n\n*I offended Lu Ding. He's not going to retaliate later, is he?*\n\n*We're both in Baofan District. Will he make things difficult for me in the future?*\n\n*What if he's targeting me because of this incident and the netherworld artifacts get exposed?*\n\n*Why did Mom call in the middle of the night?*\n\n*And she was asking about Lu Ding, of all people.*\n\n*Could they have some kind of connection?*\n\n*That's impossible. They shouldn't have had any contact at all.*\n\nNo, he couldn't rest easy.\n\nCao Yuan sat up, fished his phone out from under his pillow, and dialed Jia Yuanfang. He had to ask her properly. But he called once, twice, three times, and she didn't pick up.\n\nThis made Cao Yuan antsy.\n\nHe switched to messaging his older brother, Cao Zi'ang, telling him about his worries and how their mother had called the previous night to ask about Lu Ding.\n\nIt wasn't long before a message came back.\n\n[Little Yuan, you must not act rashly. Wait for me to get back for everything. Business here should be wrapped up today, and I can be in Yunhai by tonight. Once I'm there, I guarantee that even if Lu Ding had ten times the nerve, he wouldn't dare touch you. Worst case, we settle it with our skills. I have already seen through his weaknesses. If we fight, the odds are eighty-twenty. I'm the eighty, he's the twenty.]\n\nSeeing this message, Cao Yuan instantly relaxed.\n\nAs long as his big brother was here, the sky wouldn't fall.\n\nAlthough there was the cautionary tale of Qiu Tianrang.\n\nBut Qiu Tianrang was Qiu Tianrang, and Cao Zi'ang was Cao Zi'ang. The two couldn't be compared.\n\nHe believed his big brother would definitely win!\n\nDefinitely!\n\n***\n\nInside the Cao Family Compound, many of the Cao disciples had already begun their morning exercises.\n\nA day's planning is done in the morning, a year's in the spring. For Qi Refiners, the morning was undoubtedly the best time of day for cultivation.\n\nAs the sun rose in the east, purple qi² suffused the air. Taking a breath of the crisp morning spiritual energy was an ice-cold, refreshing sensation. That was the real deal.\n\nA quiet and peaceful atmosphere spread out.\n\nCao Yuan was right, the sky wouldn't fall. With or without Cao Zi'ang, the sky wouldn't fall. But the gate could.\n\nWith a loud *BOOM*.\n\nThe Cao clansmen guarding the entrance flew backward, along with the two vermilion gates, and crashed into the courtyard.\n\nAll the Cao disciples looked over.\n\nLu Ding strode in like the wind, his aura sharp and imposing. His voice boomed out, unsettlingly tightening the chests of those who heard it.\n\n\"749 is making an arrest! Tell Cao Yuan to get his ass out here!!!\"\n\nDark clouds gathered in the sky. With every step he took forward, the clouds pressed down, blotting out the light inch by inch, creating the oppressive atmosphere of an impending storm. The sense of pressure instantly maxed out.\n\nThis was the new technique Lu Ding had acquired: Foul Wind, Bloody Rain.\n\nIf the Cao family cooperated today, everything would be fine. The guilty would be arrested, the innocent let go. If they didn't cooperate, then darkness would fall, the wind would rise, and the rain would descend—to blow away their three immortal and seven mortal souls, to dissolve their flesh and bone.\n\n***\n\n¹ **egg flower** (蛋花, *dànhuā*): The literal name for the wispy, flower-like strands of cooked egg in egg drop soup.\n² **purple qi** (紫氣, *zǐqì*): In Daoism, this is an auspicious energy said to come from the east at sunrise, considered optimal for cultivation.",

    "content": "...\n\nThat sound echoed within the high-walled estate.\n\nThe moment the number “749” was spoken, you could have heard a pin drop.\n\nAs the saying goes, a person's name is like a tree's shadow. 749's reputation was awe-inspiring, and Lu Ding's was infamous. To see him was to give him a wide berth; to hear his name was to be struck with terror.\n\nIt was the same principle.\n\nCao Family Alley was not small, and this Cao Family Estate was not small either.\n\nSearching for him location by location would take forever. Lu Ding was simply convinced that Cao Yuan was a man of Cao Family Alley. The monk can run, but the temple can't. Today, he was blocking the main gate and asking them one question: are you handing him over or not!\n\nThat business about \"every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt its debtor\"—finding the specific person responsible? Nonsense.\n\nLu Ding didn't play by those rules.\n\nSince you all chose to make him your Young Master, then you all have to bear the consequences together.\n\nHe took a step forward.\n\nThough the surrounding Cao family disciples were afraid, they still took a step forward with him, attempting to block his advance.\n\nLu Ding raised an eyebrow. \"Senseless.\"\n\nA dull thrumming sound emanated from within his body, and a sonic wave burst forth.\n\nDozens of Cao family disciples instantly shut down and collapsed to the ground, unconscious.\n\n\"The Corpse-Dissolving Tai Sui is truly domineering, coming all the way to my Cao family to swagger around and injure my clansmen! Do you think my Cao family has no one to stand against you?!\"\n\nA figure leaped from the depths of the courtyard, carrying an imposing aura. The glint of a cold blade arrived first, the shriek of a sword piercing the air.\n\nLu Ding raised his hand and caught the long, white-gleaming sword with his bare flesh.\n\nWith immense strength in his body, the long sword shattered inch by inch.\n\nThe young man arrived right after, condensing Qi into solid form in mid-air and stomping down.\n\nLu Ding kicked his leg up toward the sky. From bottom to top, though he was at a disadvantageous angle, that kick flew out.\n\nThe man was sent flying back the same way he came.\n\nOnly, his return trip was not as graceful as his arrival, and he smashed through a large section of brick wall.\n\n\"And here I thought you were some tough character. Today, I'm bullying your Cao family precisely because you have no one. What can you do about it?\"\n\n\"If your Cao family had anyone competent, would you push a piece of trash like Cao Yuan to be your Young Master?\"\n\n\"If your Cao family had anyone competent, would you be trafficking funerary artifacts to foreign countries?\"\n\n\"If your Cao family had anyone competent, would you be unable to expand, reduced to wanting to cooperate with Great Black Mountain to swallow up the Xie family's market share and business?\"\n\n\"Now the big shots won't come out, so they send a junior to take the fall? Get Cao Yuan and the head of the Cao family to roll out here right now!\"\n\nLu Ding's aura had already risen to a terrifying level, making one's blood run cold.\n\nFrom the depths of the estate, a group of people, seeing they could no longer hide, had no choice but to fly out, steeling themselves.\n\nThe two men at the front were Cao Yutang and Cao Jianshu, the very ones who, according to 749's intelligence, had assisted and agreed with Cao Yuan's trafficking of funerary artifacts.\n\nBoth were veteran Spiritual Sea Realm masters.\n\nAmong them, the head of the Cao family, Cao Yutang, stepped forward. \"Patrol Officer Lu, could there be some misunderstanding in all this?\"\n\nHe was confident that he had handled the matter of the funerary artifacts trafficking very well; it was impossible that he had left any trace.\n\nSo where did this Lu Ding find out?\n\nResisting law enforcement was impractical. Whether they could win a fight or not, it was unnecessary, unless it was a matter of last resort.\n\nSo right now, what he had to do was deny it to the death. Cao Family Alley had never done such a thing.\n\nBut as the saying goes: in ancient times, the Jinyiwei¹; today, 749. If you don't want anyone to know, don't do it in the first place.\n\nWith modern technology and 749's all-pervasive methods, how could you possibly do something without leaving a single trace?\n\nLu Ding couldn't be bothered to waste his breath on this.\n\nEvidence?\n\nWhat if I present the evidence, you stall me, and Cao Yuan escapes?\n\nHow many novels have you read where they show up, start questioning, present the evidence, get into a fight, and let the key person escape? Those are all cautionary tales.\n\nLu Ding wouldn't do something so stupid.\n\nHis eyes swept over him. \"I call you Master Cao to give you face. If I don't give you face, what the hell are you? I'm here to arrest someone. Are you incapable of understanding human speech?\"\n\n\"I'll give you three minutes. If I don't see Cao Yuan in three minutes, your Cao Family Alley will be guilty of harboring a fugitive. Do you understand?!\"\n\nLu Ding gave him no face at all. Under normal circumstances, Cao Yutang's face should have darkened long ago. A junior, a young man, in Cao Family Alley, in front of so many people, was verbally insulting him, the head of the Cao family. No one could tolerate that.\n\nEven a worm will turn.\n\nBut Cao Yutang didn't react.\n\nHis expression eased, and he let out a tight breath.\n\n*They only found out about Cao Yuan? Good, good. As long as Cao Family Alley isn't implicated, it's fine.*\n\nInsults? So what? Insults don't cost a piece of flesh. Who in the entire Bao Fan District didn't know that this Lu Ding was outrageously arrogant and absurdly powerful? This was just Lu Ding's normal persona. If his attitude were anything else, Cao Yutang would have found it strange.\n\nAs long as Cao Yutang himself wasn't implicated, as long as Cao Family Alley wasn't implicated, everything was negotiable.\n\nAnd speaking of which...\n\nCao Yuan wasn't his son. What did his life or death have to do with him?\n\nNow that Cao Yuan was about to be arrested, as long as he arranged it so the dead can't testify, claiming Cao Yuan committed suicide out of guilt, the matter of the funerary artifacts would end there. The lingering threat would be resolved. At worst, Cao Family Alley would just stop trafficking funerary artifacts in the future.\n\nThey'd already earned more than enough.\n\nBesides, this business shouldn't have been Cao Family Alley's to begin with. Giving it back now was no great loss. It was just some extra cash on the side.\n\nAnd it would free up the position of Young Master.\n\nAny of his several sons could take the spot.\n\nIn this generation of the Cao family's second branch, besides Cao Yuan and Cao Zi'ang, there wasn't a single decent candidate.\n\nAnd Cao Zi'ang was a 749 investigator, so he couldn't and shouldn't be the Young Master.\n\nIt was simply killing two birds with one stone.\n\nAs the thoughts flashed through his mind, it was clear that none of those in charge were simple-minded.\n\nAt that moment, Cao Yutang's attitude became extremely proactive.\n\n\"Patrol Officer Lu, my Cao Family Alley will certainly cooperate with your enforcement. Please wait a moment, I will go bring Cao Yuan here immediately.\"\n\nHis intentions were as plain as day.²\n\nCao Jianshu knew what he was thinking, and so did Lu Ding.\n\nBut Lu Ding didn't care. All he wanted was a result. Alive or dead, the outcome would be the same. Since he was going to die anyway, bringing a dead body would save him the trouble. As soon as he saw Cao Yuan's corpse, Lu Ding would erupt and take down these two old-timers.\n\nHe could play along for a while, just for the fun of it.\n\nBut Cao Jianshu couldn't.\n\nThat was his son!!\n\nHis own flesh and blood!!!!\n\nHis face changed instantly, and he reached out to stop him. \"Cao Yutang, you bastard, what do you think you're doing?!\"\n\nHis hand was intercepted halfway and clamped firmly by Lu Ding.\n\nLu Ding's tone was icy. \"Cao Jianshu, are you trying to obstruct justice?\"\n\nFeeling the immense force on his arm, Cao Jianshu couldn't care less about anything else now. He shouted, \"Patrol Officer Lu!!! Lu Ding!!! That bastard Cao Yutang wants to kill my son!!\"\n\nThe hidden meaning was laid bare.\n\nCao Yutang looked at Lu Ding, his heart pounding with anxiety.\n\nHe saw that Lu Ding's expression was resolute. \"Impossible. Master Cao is the head of Cao Family Alley, and Cao Yuan is its Young Master. You open your mouth and claim the head of the family wants to murder the Young Master. What? Cat got your tongue?\"\n\n\"Right! How could I possibly murder little Yuan? He's my nephew. With Patrol Officer Lu here, a patrol officer for the entire Bao Fan District, he's not going to wrong little Yuan, is he? Little Yuan made a mistake, and we of the Cao family believe in owning up to what you've done. As his father, you can't go, to avoid any conflict of interest.\"\n\n\"Little Yuan is the Young Master of Cao Family Alley; others aren't of high enough status to go.\"\n\n\"As the head of the Cao family, and little Yuan's uncle, it is my duty to go. Patrol Officer Lu, please control my second brother's emotions. He might start spouting nonsense. I'll be right back.\"\n\nThe two of them went back and forth, and anyone who didn't know better would have thought they were on the same side.\n\nWatching Cao Yutang fly off, as if afraid of being too slow, Cao Jianshu felt a sense of dread. It's over... it's all over...\n\nBut a sliver of hope remained in his heart. Blood is thicker than water. This was his own elder brother, Cao Yuan's own uncle. He wouldn't... he probably wouldn't...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Jinyiwei (錦衣衛):** The Embroidered Uniform Guard, the imperial secret police of the Ming Dynasty, known for their absolute authority and ruthless methods.\n2.

    "content": "...\n\nIn the room.\n\nCao Yuan had just lain down, not yet fast asleep, when the wooden door to his room was slammed open with a bang.\n\nHe flipped over and got out of bed, on guard. Seeing it was his uncle, Cao Yutang, Cao Yuan let out a sigh of relief; he had subconsciously assumed Lu Ding had come knocking.\n\nHe’d practically developed a phobia of Lu Ding.\n\nBut that was normal. Of those who opposed Lu Ding, how many had managed to stay alive?\n\nBeing afraid was normal; not being afraid was what was abnormal.\n\nCao Yuan rubbed his eyes and asked, \"Uncle, you...\"\n\nAs he spoke, he completely failed to notice the murderous glint in Cao Yutang's eyes.\n\nWith a palm strike through the air, Lingqi¹ surged into Cao Yuan's body, destroying the life force within him.\n\nFrom the outside, he looked no different from a normal person, but a closer inspection would reveal that all of Cao Yuan's meridians were severed and his Qi cyclone destroyed.\n\n\"Oh, my dear Yuan!!! Ahahahahahahahahaha!\"\n\n\"You truly died a worthy death, a worthy death!\"\n\nThe expression on Cao Yutang's face shifted from grief to laughter.\n\nAlthough he didn't particularly like this nephew, they had a long history. The boy had called him \"Uncle\" since he was little, and today, he had just killed him like this. Cao Yutang's heart ached.\n\nBut if he didn't kill him.\n\nThen it wouldn't be a matter of his heart aching or not. It would be a matter of not being able to go on at all.\n\nNow that Cao Yuan was dead, the matter of trafficking nether artifacts was settled, put to an end right here.\n\nFrom now on, the Cao Family Alley would be law-abiding. This was a cautionary tale, indeed.\n\nCao Yutang picked up Cao Yuan's corpse, shaking his head helplessly.\n\n\"Sigh, Yuan, don't you blame your uncle. Once we get through this difficult time, I'll go home and work hard with your aunt. You do your best to get reincarnated into my family, and won't the position of young master still be yours?\"\n\n\"The death of you, one Cao Yuan, brings happiness to our whole family. This deal is worth it, this deal is worth it, my child...\"\n\nThese words served to console himself.\n\nWrapping the corpse in the quilt, he left with quick steps.\n\nAfter passing through several courtyards, his voice preceded him.\n\n\"Yuan... my dear Yuan... Uncle has failed you...\"\n\n\"How could you have just left like this... Even if we truly did something wrong... Enforcer Lu would have handled it impartially... Why did you have to commit suicide out of fear of punishment, leaving behind your father, your uncle, and a host of elders, for the white-haired to send off the black-haired...\"\n\nHearing this, Cao Jianshu's body trembled. He turned around in disbelief.\n\nHis eyes instantly became bloodshot as he stared at the bundle in Cao Yutang's arms.\n\nThe young man's eyes were tightly shut, his complexion normal, as if he were merely asleep.\n\nBut upon closer inspection and perception, there was not the slightest trace of breath being exchanged.\n\nHe staggered two steps and reached out, just about to take Cao Yuan from Cao Yutang's hands.\n\nAt that very moment.\n\nLu Ding's voice sounded from behind: \"Tsk tsk tsk, a white-haired man sending off a black-haired one is indeed tragic. But don't worry, you just lie down and wait a bit. It won't be long before you go to join your son.\"\n\nAn arm hooked around Cao Jianshu's neck. Lu Ding twisted at the waist with explosive force, and Cao Jianshu shot straight up from the ground, tracing a semicircle through the air before slamming heavily onto the ground.\n\nThe bluestone tiles shattered.\n\nHe landed face-first, already grievously injured. The blow completely robbed him of his ability to move, the number of broken bones in his body unknown.\n\nAs for why Lu Ding didn't kill him, it was because he had already told Old Gao he would send him some credit.\n\nBeing untrustworthy with Jia Yuanfang was because she herself was an untrustworthy person who helped foreign monsters harm her own people. Did someone like that deserve it?\n\nGao Zhengliang was different.\n\nDuring his time at the Security Management Bureau, a director of his stature had run errands for Lu Ding, passing on messages and providing information. As a person, one had to know how to repay favors.\n\nThe scene unfolding before him left Cao Yutang somewhat bewildered.\n\nHe looked at Lu Ding, who was stretching his muscles, and asked, uncomprehending, \"Enforcer... Enforcer Lu, what are you doing?\"\n\nLu Ding spread his hands and said with an air of perfect reason, \"Isn't it obvious? Take out one, and that just leaves you. So much easier, isn't it?\"\n\nCao Yutang tried to say something else.\n\nLu Ding raised a hand to cut him off. \"Eh, that's enough. I don't want to hear what you have to say, and I don't have the authority to answer your questions. Now, you listen to me.\"\n\n\"The only reason I didn't just ambush you and end this fight simply is because I heard you're an eighth-level Spirit Sea Realm cultivator with a few tricks up your sleeve.\"\n\nLu Ding paced about casually. His steps seemed random and chaotic, but the more Cao Yutang watched, the more his heart sank.\n\nHe had blocked every possible escape route from every direction.\n\nUnless he could fly, launching straight up and away.\n\nBut he didn't know how to do that!\n\nLu Ding continued.\n\n\"You see, I've learned a new technique. It's different from the ones I knew before. It's very special, and I'm curious about its practical effect. But I couldn't find a suitable opponent—I can't just grab someone and start hitting them, can I? So, Family Head Cao, I'll give you some face and call you Family Head Cao.\"\n\n\"You will use every ounce of your skill to attack me, unleash your life's cultivation to please me. If you can satisfy me, I might reward you by leaving your corpse whole. But if you're a letdown, let's just say we agreed beforehand... it'll be eight pieces, okay?\"\n\nHis previous techniques were all one monster, one technique.\n\nBloody Wind and Gory Rain, on the other hand, was a product of fusing the Blood Rain Technique and the Wind-Pinning Technique, which he was rewarded with after killing the vampire.\n\nAs for his other techniques, Lu Ding could wait for an opportunity to test them. For instance, the General's Armor Donning Technique and the Living Molt, Living Birth Technique—Lu Ding's thought was to test them if he got the chance, and if not, so be it.\n\nAfter all, one of them increased his overall combat power on top of his existing foundation, and it looked cool.\n\nThe other was a recovery skill.\n\nWith his current combat power, he couldn't even find an opponent. What was the point of using the General's Armor? Who would he even hit with it?\n\nAnd no person or monster could even injure him, so Living Molt, Living Birth was just for show.\n\nFortunately, there was this Cao Yutang today, an eighth-level Spirit Sea Realm cultivator, no less. He was considered the strongest opponent Lu Ding had faced so far.\n\nBut he wasn't greedy.\n\nJust testing Bloody Wind and Gory Rain would be enough. He'd wait a few days for the Ghost Festival to try General's Armor and Living Molt.\n\nLu Ding's tone was light and his posture relaxed, but as Cao Yutang watched, his heart couldn't stop sinking.\n\nHe casually tossed aside the corpse wrapped in the quilt.\n\nCao Yutang adopted a defensive stance and looked at Lu Ding. \"Enforcer Lu, can we really not talk about this at all?\"\n\nLu Ding's figure blurred, leaving behind an afterimage as he reappeared in front of him, so fast that Cao Yutang couldn't react at all.\n\nHe raised his hand.\n\nSMACK!\n\nA slap landed, making the skin on his face tremble and swell up instantly.\n\n\"Still want to talk?\"\n\n*I've already fucking told you everything, and you're still asking if we can talk, if we can talk. Are you deaf!?*\n\nThis slap completely ignited Cao Yutang's fury. Who was he? He was the current head of the Cao Family Alley, a veteran eighth-level Spirit Sea Realm powerhouse. And now he was being slapped in the face by a fledgling junior?\n\n\"Time and time again!! You've humiliated me time and time again!!!! Lu Ding!!!!! I swear we will never exist under the same sky!!!!\"\n\nThe aura of an eighth-level Spirit Sea Realm cultivator erupted, stirring up the surrounding dust and making his sleeves whip about. Cao Yutang sank into his stance as a strange, pulling force drew upon the Lingqi between heaven and earth.\n\nHe opened one hand, palm out, pushing his aura outward.\n\nThis was the Cao family's ultimate technique: the Spirit-Hunting Stance and the Spirit-Severing Palm.\n\n***\n\n¹ Lingqi (灵炁): A form of spiritual or vital energy central to cultivation stories.",

    "content": "......\n\nLu Ding stood rooted to the spot.\n\nSpeaking in a tone of a show about to begin, he said, \"Now, let the warm-up begin.\"\n\nSpiritual Qi flowed over Cao Yutang's palm. He cleared a path with his palm, employing a style that was nimble and agile yet powerful.\n\nLu Ding casually tilted his head to dodge, his steps elegant, constantly shifting his body posture.\n\nHe felt the Spiritual Qi within his body and all around him being rapidly disturbed.\n\nHe praised, \"Severing Spirit Palm. That 'severing' character truly has spirit.\"\n\nSeeing that he was completely unaffected by the Severing Spirit Palm, Cao Yutang was somewhat incredulous: \"Why are you fine!?!?\"\n\nThe Cao Family's ultimate technique, Severing Spirit Palm.\n\nThose struck by it would have the Spiritual Qi circulation within their bodies severed, leading to blocked meridians. Ultimately, with nowhere to flow, the Spiritual Qi would accumulate in one place, leading to a burst body and death.\n\nEven if not directly hit, when clashing with a Severing Spirit Palm user, their unique method of Spiritual Qi manipulation would disturb the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Qi, as well as one's own circulating Spiritual Qi. This would result in restricted movement and obstructed Qi flow, ultimately leading to being struck by the Severing Spirit Palm.\n\nSpiritual Qi circulation is like a one-way lane. Originally, the Spiritual Qi within the body flows normally, traffic in order.\n\nHowever, Spiritual Qi disturbed by the Severing Spirit Palm would flow in reverse, or even block the middle of the road, or suddenly change lanes, crashing into guardrails front and back. In such a situation, a car crash is inevitable.\n\nAs for why Lu Ding was unaffected.\n\n\"Your Severing Spirit Palm is merely a rudimentary understanding of Spiritual Qi. By disturbing Spiritual Qi, you achieve the goal of obstructing your target's Qi flow, leading to them being struck by you.\"\n\n\"Although my realm isn't as high as yours, your understanding of Spiritual Qi isn't even one ten-thousandth of mine.\"\n\nArrogant!\n\nUtterly arrogant!\n\nYou, a person not yet twenty, are talking to me about Spiritual Qi understanding.\n\nAnd you even dare to say that a Spirit Sea Eightfold cultivator has less understanding than you, a Spirit Sea Twofold cultivator!?\n\nCao Yutang was about to speak, but then he realized something was off!\n\nBecause he cultivated the Severing Spirit Palm and Spirit Hunting Stakes, he was exceptionally sensitive to the circulation of Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Qi.\n\nUnder his careful perception, Cao Yutang was horrified to discover that the Spiritual Qi swirling around Lu Ding..... how..... how could it be so similar to the spontaneous inflow of Spiritual Qi during a state of Unity of Heaven and Man!?\n\nSpiritual Qi enters a Qi Refiner's body through the Eight Extraordinary Meridians, and it needs to be absorbed; Spiritual Qi is drawn into the body from between Heaven and Earth.\n\nHowever, Unity of Heaven and Man is different.\n\nCultivators only need to open their meridian valves, and Spiritual Qi can automatically flow in according to their needs.\n\nHow much can enter depends entirely on how much the meridians can bear.\n\n\"Unity of Heaven and Man!! How is that possible!! Unity of Heaven and Man isn't..... How could you.....\"\n\nWatching Lu Ding's leisurely stroll, and how he could still converse casually with him, Cao Yutang felt as if he were dreaming. Everything was too fantastical, constantly shattering his worldview.\n\nIn response, Lu Ding stated.\n\n\"My apologies, I opened it and then forgot to close it.\"\n\nCao Yutang: \"Huh?\"\n\nHe didn't understand.\n\n\"Alright, Patriarch Cao, I'm quite satisfied with your performance. Next, we'll get to the main event.\"\n\nLu Ding raised his hand over his head and snapped his fingers.\n\nClick.\n\nIn an instant, the wind changed, clouds shifted, and the sky grew dark. An indescribable sensation assailed him, and everywhere he looked was a dim, desolate world.\n\n\"Yin Domain Overlap!!!!?\"\n\nCao Yutang cried out, his mind collapsing this time.\n\nIs this still a method a human can use? How can a human use Yin Domain Overlap?\n\nUnity of Heaven and Man plus Yin Domain Overlap.\n\nYes, this isn't a method a human can use: \"Lu Ding, you're a monster, you're a monster, aren't you? You're not human.\"\n\nAt this moment, he wished so much that Lu Ding would affirm him with a \"You guessed it,\" accompanied by an eerie laugh. If that were the case, Cao Yutang could have accepted it.\n\nBut all that answered him was the sound of rain.\n\nLu Ding couldn't be bothered with him. This person was simply sick in the head. How could he, a perfectly alive human, be a monster?\n\nHowever, it must be said, even Lu Ding himself felt that this Bloody Wind and Rain Art truly resembled Yin Domain Overlap, especially since he had personally encountered Yin Domain Overlap just a few days prior.\n\nThe only difference was that Lu Ding could confirm he was human, and he could also confirm Fang Du was a ghost.\n\nTherefore, this definitely wasn't Yin Domain Overlap!\n\nA drop of bloody rain fell from the sky, landing squarely on Cao Yutang's forehead.\n\nBefore he could even touch it, a piercing pain assailed him. His flesh melted, and his bones caved in.\n\nCountless drops of bloody rain immediately rained down from the sky, dense and leaving no space for evasion.\n\nCao Yutang was drenched from head to toe, like a drowned rat*.\n\n\"Ah!!!! Ah!!!! Come out!!! Come out!!! Lu Ding!!! Get out here!!! You monster!!! What kind of skill is it to hide and stab from the shadows, get out here!!!!\"\n\nThe flesh on his body was continuously washed away and slid off by the rain.\n\nCao Yutang had nowhere to hide, nowhere to evade.\n\nUnder the pain, he mobilized the Spiritual Qi within his body to its maximum extent, bombarding everything around him.\n\nThe bloody rain blurred his vision. In a daze, Cao Yutang seemed to see figures flickering within the bloody rain, moving from far to near. That eerie and oppressive feeling chilled him to the bone.\n\nFew Qi Refiners would be afraid of ghosts, but if they encountered a situation like this, few Qi Refiners wouldn't be afraid.\n\nThis was even more terrifying and suffocating than ghosts.\n\nPerhaps it was the emotional rock bottom rebound.\n\nCao Yutang ignored his injuries, wiped away the rain from his face—taking half his facial skin with it—then charged towards the figure in the rain.\n\n\"Hahahahaha Lu Ding, and you say you're not a monster? You *are* a monster, you're a ghost! I'll kill you, I'll kill you!!!!\"\n\nHis charging footsteps slowed from fast.\n\nUntil finally, his steps became a stumble. He lifted a leg, set it down, and his body shrank by half. He lifted again, set down again, and his body shrank by another half.\n\nHe looked back, then looked down.\n\nIt turned out that while running in the rain, his legs had melted into the pooling bloody rainwater on the ground.\n\nUntil his lower body completely disappeared, Cao Yutang stood propped up before Lu Ding.\n\nHe raised his head. His face was already bone, his teeth falling out one by one, as he mumbled his dying words: \"Got you.....\"\n\nLu Ding pressed the pause button on his phone's timer.\n\nThe wind ceased, the rain stopped, and all strange phenomena vanished.\n\nHe shook his head: \"Five point three-three seconds.\"\n\n\"Bloody Wind and Rain. You only lasted five point three-three seconds in the rain. I had such high hopes for you, and yet you only lasted five point three-three seconds. I didn't even use the 'bloody wind' part, and you.......\"\n\nThis was the first time Lu Ding felt speechless after a battle.\n\n\"I really have to wonder if your Spirit Sea Eightfold cultivation is watered down**.\"\n\nLooking at the half-torso of Cao Yutang, who was also incomplete, it was the first time he had gone back on his own words.\n\nThis eight-segment cut, it seems unnecessary now.\n\nOverall, he was quite satisfied with the effect of the Bloody Wind and Rain Art. The only thing was that its consumption was a bit high; every drop of rain was formed from his Spiritual Qi. If it lasted too long, Lu Ding wouldn't be able to sustain it. Using his own Spiritual Qi to maintain the Bloody Wind and Rain Art, he could at most sustain it for about a day.\n\nLu Ding turned his head to look towards the depths of the Cao family mansion.\n\n\"Don't novels often say that every family has an old monster holding down the fort? As long as the family encounters some crisis, the old monster will come out. Why is there still no movement?\"\n\n---\n* *Drowned rat*: A common English idiom meaning completely soaked and looking miserable.\n** *Watered down*: An idiom meaning diluted or lacking in quality; implying it's not as good as it seems.",

    "content": "......\n\nThe Cao family did have an Old Master, but he had always been in seclusion, attempting to break through to the Divine Palace Realm—something the outside world was well aware of.\n\nHe would only make an appearance once a year for his birthday or for major Cao family events.\n\nAs for where he was in seclusion, no one knew.\n\nSome said it was right within the Cao family compound, others said it was deep in the mountain forests.\n\nNot having had his fill, Lu Ding had run in and searched for quite a while. Forget people, not even a single bird had flown out.\n\n\"Forget it. I'll find a powerful monster to test myself against next time.\"\n\nSeeing him turn and leave, deep within the Cao family's grand residence, an old man on a rattan chair let out a long sigh of relief, his hand still clutching a pigeon that was eager to take flight.\n\nThe young people these days are truly one more terrifying than the next. These old bones of his couldn't withstand such turmoil.\n\nAs for the death of two sons and a grandson?\n\nWas that a big deal?!\n\nAs if he didn't have other sons and grandsons. A rotten seed should be discarded.\n\nIf he weren't the patriarch presiding over Cao Family Lane, if he were just an ordinary old Qi Cultivator with only these two sons, he would have definitely charged out to fight Lu Ding to the death.\n\nAfter all, he was just a bag of old bones. Living as a lonely old man wouldn't be very interesting anyway.\n\nBut he wasn't.\n\nThere were so many people in Cao Family Lane, so many of his descendants. If he were gone, and with no one in the current Cao family capable of truly holding the reins, Cao Family Lane would likely be devoured by outsiders, with not even the bones left.\n\nSo, losing two sons wasn't a big problem.\n\nLosing a grandson wasn't a big problem either.\n\nHadn't Cao Ying returned? Compared to Cao Yuan, he much preferred Cao Ying.\n\nNow that Cao Yuan was dead, the position of Young Master was vacant...\n\nAt this thought, the Cao Family's Old Patriarch suddenly paused.\n\n\"Aiya, I'm getting old, I'm getting old. What 'Young Master'? Yutang is gone, so the position of 'Family Head' is vacant. Wouldn't it be perfect to just let Cao Ying take the position of Family Head? Hahahahahaha.\"\n\n.....\n\nOutside the Cao family compound, Lu Ding walked out and waved for the people waiting outside to move in.\n\nA large group of peace officers, armed with live ammunition, instantly swarmed in.\n\nGao Zhengliang twisted open a bottle of mineral water and handed it over. \"Good work, Patrol Officer Lu. What's the situation inside?\"\n\nLu Ding took a sip. \"Just as I promised you, of course. Everything's taken care of. They won't dare to resist. Just go ahead and arrest them.\"\n\n\"There's just one thing, though. Of the three main culprits, I only left you one.\"\n\n\"Which one?\" Gao Zhengliang asked curiously.\n\n\"Only Cao Jianshu is left. Cao Yuan was killed by his uncle, and as for Cao Yutang, only half of him is left.\"\n\n\"Half? Did you cut him?\"\n\nThe question nearly made Lu Ding choke on his water. \"Not exactly, but it was because of me. I just wanted to test out a new technique I learned, but he couldn't handle it. I originally intended to leave him a complete corpse, but who knew he'd be so useless.\"\n\nGao Zhengliang opened his mouth, unsure of what to say.\n\nLu Ding was a good man, a really good man. His work efficiency was absurdly high. Since coming to the Baofan District, he'd managed both human and ghost affairs. He had thoroughly disciplined the three local Qi Cultivator factions, the 'local snakes' of Baofan District, one by one, and without a single mishap.\n\nThis laid a solid foundation for Gao Zhengliang's future work.\n\nIn the future, if the Peacekeeping Administration Bureau needed assistance with a case and approached these three families, they would likely cooperate enthusiastically out of respect for Lu Ding.\n\nInstead of the old attitude of, \"Peace officers have no jurisdiction over Qi Cultivators. This is your own business. I'll help if I feel like it,\" and so on.\n\nBut there was a slight imperfection.\n\nNamely, his methods were too brutal. Gao Zhengliang had hardly ever seen a complete body.\n\nOften, when Gao Zhengliang thought about it, he would think to himself, *Heh, thank goodness I'm a human, and an ordinary one at that. I don't get mixed up in the affairs of these Qi Cultivators.*\n\nOtherwise, running into someone like Lu Ding would be truly terrible luck.\n\nThe accomplices on the list were brought out one by one.\n\nGao Zhengliang's grin nearly reached his ears.\n\nThis was a bona fide major case.\n\nThe amount involved was several billion, and it even involved Qi Cultivators. He could count this as a joint operation with the 749 Bureau.\n\nFurthermore, Lu Ding was letting him take the lion's share of the credit.\n\nAlthough at his age, he wasn't going to climb much higher, as a man who'd been a peace officer his whole life, who wouldn't want to add a few more major, closed cases to their professional record?\n\nLu Ding walked over to a trash can on the roadside. Lighting a cigarette, he pulled out his phone to check for messages.\n\nAnd as it turned out, there was one.\n\n[Yan Feifan: Brother Lu, Investigator Bai Heming came looking for you at the docks. He said the Bureau sent him as support. He couldn't find you at Xingteng Capital, so I gave him the runaround. Should I tell him where you are now?]\n\nBai Heming....\n\nThe \"Many-Times-Reborn Stupa\"¹ Bai Heming?\n\nLu Ding replied: \"No need. Let's meet at the Bureau. I'm almost done here anyway.\"\n\nAfter snuffing out the cigarette butt with his fingers and tossing it into the trash can, Lu Ding chose not to fly this time.\n\nAfter all, it was broad daylight. Being seen would create a bad impression. He borrowed a car from Gao Zhengliang and drove toward the Bureau with Jia Yuanfang.\n\n....\n\nMorning.\n\nOn the national highway leading into Yunhai City, a three-wheeled motorcycle sped along at eighty miles per hour.\n\nCao Ying sat in the sidecar. He shoved aside a corpse that was lying on top of him, spat, and coughed up half an ear.\n\nBlood dyed his entire mouth red and streamed down his chest.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha! Compete with me?! Are you even worthy of competing with me?!! Hahahahahaha!!\"\n\nAmidst his wild laughter, Cao Ying took an object out from his robes. It looked roughly like a miniature figurine of a person riding a chariot, a dark light flowing over it, with an ornate canopy on top. This was the Zhiren Zhima.²\n\nThe legendary immortal Lingzhi herb. It was said that eating it would allow one to attain the Dao and become an immortal, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight.\n\nBut that was just a legend. In reality, the Zhiren Zhima had the effect of breaking through cultivation realms and extending one's life. It could also enhance one's cultivation, deepen one's comprehension of heaven and earth, and for those with profound fortune, it could even help them enter a state of unity between heaven and man.\n\nThe Cao family's Old Patriarch had long been stuck at the ninth level of the Spirit Sea Realm, unable to advance to the Divine Palace.\n\nFor Cao Ying to return this time and challenge Cao Yuan for the position of Young Master of Cao Family Lane, he absolutely needed the Old Patriarch's approval.\n\nNormally, this would be almost impossible. Once a position was set, it was set. There was no precedent for challenging and replacing it.\n\nBut with the Zhiren Zhima, things might be different.\n\nThe underling driving the motorcycle joined Cao Ying in wild laughter.\n\nThe two of them let out strange whoops of \"Oho!\" \"Oho!\" all the way back to Cao Family Lane.\n\nBut as soon as they arrived, Cao Ying was dumbfounded.\n\nVans from the Peacekeeping Administration Bureau were parked outside the Cao family mansion. Peeking through the iron gates at the vehicles, he could see the members of the Second Branch inside, all hanging their heads in dejection, looking exactly like eggplants wilted by frost.\n\nHuh...? What's the meaning of this?\n\nCao Ying looked at his underling, only to see that he was equally baffled.\n\nJust as Cao Ying was about to go up and ask someone what was going on, the Old Patriarch's voice suddenly echoed in his ear, telling him to go to the rear of the mansion.\n\nFilled with confusion, Cao Ying arrived at the rear residence.\n\nThe Old Patriarch was sitting on his recliner and unhurriedly explained the cause and effect of the situation.\n\n\"So, you see, a person must only earn money that is within their capabilities. They must recognize their own limits and not be greedy. Wouldn't you agree, Niuniu?\"\n\nHe called out Cao Ying's childhood name, but received no answer.\n\nThe Old Patriarch turned his head and saw that Cao Ying was in a daze, his hand fidgeting inside his robes.\n\n\"Ah, yes, yes, yes! That's exactly right! I said long ago that having Cao Yuan as the Young Master would lead to no good. See? I was right.\"\n\n\"Then tell me, if not Cao Yuan, who should it be?\" the Old Patriarch asked with a smile.\n\n\"Me, of course!\"\n\nAs he spoke, Cao Ying took out the canopy he had just broken off the top of the Zhiren Zhima's chariot from within his robes and respectfully presented it.\n\n\"Grandfather, Cao Ying hasn't been by your side these past years and has failed to show his filial piety during the holidays. This is the Zhiren Zhima I just snatched today. I heard you're trying to break through to the Divine Palace, so this should be of great use to you.\"\n\nThe Old Patriarch reached out and took it, looking at the object in his hand with a strange expression.\n\n\"You're just giving me the canopy?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ *Futou* (浮屠): A stupa, a Buddhist reliquary monument.

    "content": "......\n\nCao Ying pointed to his disheveled state: \"For this lid, your grandson here paid no small price. My subordinates suffered countless casualties, and I risked my life to snatch it back. It's really quite a lot.\"\n\nOriginally.\n\nHis plan was to give it all to the old master.\n\nBut, here's the crucial part!\n\nHe had spent a fortune buying the Wind-Settling Bead from Lu Ding, and then expended a great deal of manpower and mental effort, going up Wind Summit to snatch this Ganoderma Human and Horse from Li Daquezi and the Heavenly Principle Cult.\n\nAll for the sake of showing filial respect to the old master, winning him over, and allowing himself to compete with Cao Yuan for the position of Young Master again, the kind that involves setting up a challenge arena.\n\nBut now, after all this, with him not returning for the past few days, it seems he doesn't need to compete anymore.\n\nNot only does he not need to compete, but even Cao Yuan is dead, along with his father.\n\nThis instantly resolved two hidden dangers.\n\nThen this Ganoderma Human and Horse suddenly had a bit more significance. Previously, he was still thinking that once the old master's matter was settled, how he should go about winning Lu Ding over to his side.\n\nNow he didn't need to think about it at all.\n\nHe'd send the remaining large portion to Lu Ding, to make a good impression.\n\nOne item, accomplishing two things, wasn't that a huge profit?\n\nAs for the old master......\n\nYou're already so old, eating a little less won't hurt, who knew that plans can't keep up with changes these days.\n\nBut he had to admit.\n\n\"This Lu Ding is truly ruthless!\"\n\nCao Ying muttered to himself.\n\nTo actually be able to kill his father Cao Yu Tang, although they were father and son, Cao Ying felt not the slightest sadness about Cao Yu Tang's death; he even wanted to laugh, and set off firecrackers.\n\nDead is dead, he was as good as dead anyway, now that he was truly dead, it was just peace and quiet.\n\n\"Is it really just one lid?\"\n\nThe Cao family's old master asked, somewhat disbelieving.\n\nCao Ying nodded vigorously: \"Really, really.\"\n\nAt this moment, his hand in his embrace was emitting spiritual energy, enveloping the gap in the Ganoderma Human and Horse, preventing its aura and scent from leaking out.\n\nSo the old master wouldn't notice.\n\nHe was going to give this item to Lu Ding. In the future, he would be the master of Cao Family Alley, and Lu Ding was the Baofan District Enforcer, so cooperation would be inevitable.\n\nCao Ying would never make such a foolish mistake as Cao Yuan.\n\nHe was shrewd.\n\nThe Cao family's old master nodded with satisfaction: \"Then you prepare yourself, pick an auspicious day, and ascend to the position of Grand Master of Cao Family Alley. Work hard in the future and strive to lead Cao Family Alley to new heights of glory.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Grand Master?\"\n\n\"Are you talking about me?\"\n\nCao Ying pointed to himself. For a moment, he was caught off guard by the sudden surprise.\n\nOriginally, his goal was to be the Young Master, but now he was being told that he didn't need to go through any procedures, or use any tactics, and could directly take the position of Grand Master.\n\n\"If not you, then me? I'm too old to worry about this whole family. But I need to tell you one thing: don't provoke Lu Ding in the future. That kid has a strange, sinister knack. Your dad, five seconds, just five seconds, 'whoosh' disappeared, and 'whoosh' came back with only half his body stuck in the ground.\"\n\nCao Ying's mouth twitched.\n\nBut thinking of Lu Ding, he suppressed a smile.\n\nCao Yuan and Lu Ding not getting along was because Cao Yuan was foolish. Although his own relationship with Lu Ding wasn't exceptionally good, they certainly weren't hostile, and could even exchange a few words.\n\nLooking at the Ganoderma Human and Horse lid in the old master's hand, Cao Ying suddenly felt a pang of regret.\n\nHe wished he hadn't given it to the old master earlier.\n\nHe's so old, what good would it do him to consume it?\n\nBetter to give it to Lu Ding and deepen the impression.\n\nUgh!!!!\n\nWhat a waste.\n\nAfter all, no one could have imagined that in just a few days, everything would be completely transformed, presenting a new dawn.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nAt the entrance of Bureau 749.\n\nLu Ding successfully met with Yan Feifan. Accompanying him was Bai Hemen, whom Lu Ding was meeting for the first time.\n\nThe two of them sized each other up.\n\nBai Hemen looked at Lu Ding, his mind constantly recalling the information about Lu Ding he had just looked up on the 749 APP in the car.\n\nHis gaze showed a hint of thought.\n\nBai Hemen was the first to speak, asking out of the blue: \"Lu Ding, do you think all monsters deserve to die?\"\n\nHe had thought Lu Ding would ponder for a moment, but who knew he wouldn't even think.\n\n\"Of course. If monsters don't die, am I supposed to die?\"\n\nWhere would the rewards come from if he didn't kill monsters?\n\nWithout rewards, how could he achieve self-realization and control his destiny?\n\nAs for whether there might be good monsters among them? Sorry, that wasn't something Lu Ding needed to consider.\n\nHearing this, Bai Hemen thought of Lu Ding's deeds in his mind, and it matched perfectly.\n\n\"Then have you never felt lost?\"\n\nLu Ding was a bit confused by what this person meant.\n\nLost?\n\n\"I really do feel lost when I can't find monsters to kill.\"\n\nThis was the truth; for nineteen years, he was almost lost to death.\n\nFortunately, effort pays off.\n\nBai Hemen forced a smile – why \"forced\"? Because his smile was too artificial, yet the amusement was genuine.\n\nReaching out his hand: \"My name is Bai Hemen. 'Bai' as in 'white crane', 'He' as in 'white crane', and 'Men' as in 'sleep'.\"\n\n\"Flowers warm, green oxen lie; pines tall, white cranes sleep. Your name is good, I'm Lu Ding.\"\n\nLu Ding's words made Bai Hemen's gaze show a hint of surprise.\n\nThis was somewhat inconsistent with the character profile of Lu Ding he had seen in the information.\n\nHow could he speak so poetically?\n\nThis made Bai Hemen feel a bit awkward; he simply couldn't think of a poem to praise Lu Ding's name.\n\n\"You... are very cultured. Impromptu?\"\n\nLu Ding had no interest in plagiarizing poems from ancient people of his previous life.\n\n\"The Immortal Poet Li Bai wrote it; I'm just using it temporarily.\"\n\nBai Hemen nodded, making a mental note of the poetic line.\n\n\"I need to turn in my mission now. Let's talk again next time.\"\n\nWatching Lu Ding's departing back as he carried Jia Yuanfang, Bai Hemen was deep in thought. It wasn't until Lu Ding's figure had completely vanished that Bai Hemen took out his phone and typed into a search engine.\n\nThe words 'Flowers warm, green oxen lie; pines tall, white cranes sleep', and then clicked search.\n\nNothing?\n\nHe was a bit confused. He then searched for Immortal Poet Li Bai, and still found nothing.\n\nLooking at the search results that made no sense, Bai Hemen suddenly felt that the bureau's information seemed somewhat inaccurate.\n\nFrom the records in the information, Lu Ding was supposed to be someone who hated evil like poison, and was also arrogant and overbearing to a certain degree.\n\nBut during their recent first meeting, Bai Hemen felt that Lu Ding was very cultured, and well-mannered, able to instantly quote classics.\n\nNow, on the search engine, he couldn't find this poetic line, nor did the person Immortal Poet Li Bai exist.\n\nBai Hemen increasingly felt that Lu Ding... was very low-key.\n\n\"So his arrogance and overbearing nature are just a facade? Internally, he's a low-key, profound, and strong individual?\"\n\nBeing low-key and profound had always been Bai Hemen's pursuit, and Lu Ding's view on monsters coincided with Bai Hemen's in certain aspects.\n\nHis eyes instantly lit up.\n\nA friend!\n\nHaving similar ideals, having areas worth learning from, and not dragging each other down – weren't these the essential conditions for a close friend!?\n\n***\n\n【Emphasis】 The protagonist's sexual orientation is normal",

    "content": "......\n\nBai Hemian suddenly felt like he'd had an epiphany!\n\nHis grandma often said before she died, \"Birds of a feather flock together.\" A good friend can influence your entire life and change the way you think, so you have to keep your eyes wide open when making friends. Don't let bad people lead you astray; learn from the good and be good.\n\nBai Hemian had thought about making friends, too.\n\nBut the people he'd met over the years were either too stupid, had no substance, or were excessively showy.\n\nThis made his life as an ordinary person very dull.\n\nLater, he joined 749. He thought he could find friends of his own in the world of Qi refiners, but it was only after joining 749 that Bai Hemian learned...\n\nNever look at people through some inexplicable filter.\n\nQi refiners really weren't that different from ordinary people.\n\nThe stupid ones were still just as stupid.\n\nBesides, those people were too weak.\n\nUtterly useless, even. They couldn't cultivate anything of substance in days. How could people like that become his friends?\n\nTheir very presence in the world was on a different level. People like that couldn't grow alongside him. The end result would only be Bai Hemian moving faster and faster, while the people behind him fell further and further away.\n\nMoreover, regarding the question from just a moment ago, he had also asked others whose talents were decent but still weaker than his. This could be considered Bai Hemian stooping to their level, trying to be downwardly compatible.\n\nLike Wen Rouchu, for instance.\n\nThe answer Bai Hemian got, however, was, \"How could that be? We can't just lump all monsters together. You have to experience everything for yourself.\"\n\nHe immediately thought there was something wrong with Wen Rouchu's brain.\n\nExperience everything? Wouldn't that be exhausting?\n\nDifferent times, different places, different people, different moods, so many different factors, even different species—how are you supposed to experience it all?\n\nIt was clearly a blatant lie, told with eyes wide open.\n\nBut Lu Ding's answer today had opened the door to a new world for Bai Hemian.\n\n......\n\nEvening arrived.\n\nLu Ding was still in the debriefing room. Because the incident this time was quite serious—several hundred civilians and even some foreigners were dead—a report submitted by Yan Feifan alone wouldn't be accepted by the higher-ups.\n\nNo choice.\n\nLu Ding had to participate, getting questioned about everything from start to finish, covering all sorts of minor details.\n\nWhile he was still tied up...\n\nOn the other side of the city, Cao Zi'ang arrived at Yunhai East Station.\n\nSqueezed into the crowd, his brow was furrowed and his expression grim.\n\nOn his phone screen was the chat interface with Cao Yuan. Dozens of messages sent, all from him, yet Cao Yuan hadn't replied to a single one.\n\nIt wasn't just Cao Yuan.\n\nHis own father, Cao Jianshu; his own mother, Jia Yuanfang; and his great-uncle, Cao Yutang, hadn't replied to his messages either.\n\nHe'd even messaged other members of the second branch, but no one had replied.\n\nThis was fucking ridiculous!!\n\nIf one person didn't reply, fine, but for a whole group of them to go silent...\n\n\"Could something have happened?\"\n\n\"No, that can't be right. Even if something happened, it wouldn't happen to all of them!?\"\n\nCao Zi'ang quickened his pace. He wanted to get back quickly to see what was going on and put the heavy stone in his heart to rest.\n\nBehind him, Wen Rouchu caught up, his tone as calm as ever as he said, \"It seems something's happened. Open the 749 app and search for Xing Teng Capital.\"\n\nCao Zi'ang could no longer remain calm.\n\nWhile opening the 749 app, he wondered, could a monster have attacked his mom's company, Xing Teng Capital!?!?\n\nThe results page appeared.\n\nA line of large text leaped into his view.\n\n【Xing Teng Capital colluded with vampires to harm hundreds of people. The mastermind, Jia Yuanfang, has been arrested by Intern Investigator Lu Ding. The main culprit, the vampire Count Fedel, has been slain.】\n\nCao Zi'ang felt like he was looking at some kind of celestial scripture.\n\n\"This... This is impossible!!?\"\n\nHe clicked for details. A sprawling text of over a thousand words described the cause and effect, right down to the final lines of the page.\n\n【Cao Family Alley's Young Master Cao Yuan, Second Branch Head Cao Jianshu, and Family Head Cao Yutang colluded with Xing Teng Capital to traffic nether artifacts.¹ Their plot was promptly discovered by Intern Investigator Lu Ding. During the arrest, Cao Yutang brutally murdered Cao Yuan, attempting to use Cao Yuan's death to stop Intern Investigator Lu Ding from pursuing the case. Lu Ding, with his keen insight, saw through Cao Yutang's ploy. A conflict erupted between the two sides, resulting in Cao Jianshu being seriously injured and taken into custody by the Public Security Bureau, later transferred to 749 for questioning. Cao Yutang died on the spot. Multiple Qi refiners from Cao Family Alley involved in the case were arrested...】\n\nMy mom colluded with vampires to harm ordinary people?\n\nMy little brother, my dad, and my great-uncle were trafficking nether artifacts?\n\nMy great-uncle killed my little brother to stop Lu Ding from investigating?\n\nSeeing all this, Cao Zi'ang's vision went black.\n\nHe didn't believe it. He wouldn't believe it even if the heavens themselves came down to tell him it was true!!!\n\nIn his eyes, his little brother Cao Yuan was so obedient; how could he possibly traffic nether artifacts!? His father, Cao Jianshu, had a bit of a violent streak, but he'd never dare do something like this. He didn't have the guts. As for his great-uncle, he adored his little brother, so how could he kill him!?\n\nFinally, the image of a gentle and graceful woman appeared in his mind. How could such a kind person collude with foreign vampires to harm ordinary people?\n\n\"Absurd!!!\"\n\n\"Lu Ding. It must be Lu Ding!!!\"\n\nCao Zi'ang's eyes gradually turned red. He thought of the messages his little brother had sent him earlier and connected them with the rumors circulating about Lu Ding!!\n\nRuthless methods, seeking revenge for the slightest grievance, unable to tolerate a single speck of dust in his eye.\n\nConnecting all these dots...\n\nA thought formed in Cao Zi'ang's mind.\n\nThis was all a setup, a trap orchestrated by Lu Ding to get revenge on Cao Yuan!!!\n\nThe goal was to wipe out the core strength of Cao Family Alley in one fell swoop, and he was afraid my mom would use her international connections to hold him accountable, so he trapped her in it, too.\n\nYes!\n\nThat must be it!\n\nThat is absolutely what happened. His little brother, his dad, his mom, his great-uncle—they would never do such things.\n\nIt was a classic case of being too close to the situation to see it clearly. Cao Zi'ang was completely trapped in this state of mind.\n\nIn his heart and in his mind, he could only see and think of the good in Cao Yuan and the others, not their faults.\n\nAnd this terrible outcome was something he refused to believe his brother, father, mother, great-uncle, and clansmen were capable of.\n\nTherefore...\n\nThe cause of it all had to be found in an outsider.\n\nCoincidentally, Lu Ding's conflicts with Cao Family Alley had been frequent and intense these past few days.\n\nCoupled with Lu Ding's glorious track record of driving a great distance just to kill a fiend from the Heavenly Principle Cult over a single threat...\n\nAnd so, Cao Zi'ang instantly pinned all the blame on Lu Ding.\n\nSeeing him losing control, Wen Rouchu interjected out of the blue, \"Perhaps there's some hidden truth to all this?\"\n\n\"Alas, but it's too late to say anything now...\"\n\nThis sentence was like the last straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nThat's right.\n\nIt's too late. Everything is too late.\n\nMy little brother is already dead...\n\nNo, wait!\n\nCao Zi'ang's head snapped up. Although his brother was dead, his father and mother were still alive. One was arrested, the other seriously injured. If he could find Lu Ding and force him to tell the truth, he could save his parents and clear their names, along with his brother's!!!\n\nHis train of thought now clear, Cao Zi'ang looked at his phone again. The post was time-stamped 18:35.\n\nAfter such a major incident, there would surely be a lot of paperwork to get through.\n\nLu Ding must still be at the bureau!!!\n\n***\n*¹Nether artifacts (`冥器`): Objects, often mystical, intended for the dead or related to the underworld.*",

    "content": "Bureau 749, 7:21 PM.\n\nLu Ding exited the interrogation room.\n\nBehind him followed the two staff members who had questioned him earlier.\n\nOne of them called out to Lu Ding, \"Enforcer Lu, the next time you act, could you, I mean, be a little gentler? Try to leave them alive, like this vampire for instance. It has great research value and could also earn you a good number of contribution points.\"\n\n\"If you could leave them alive, wouldn't you have to run fewer missions?\"\n\n\"Including the last Yin Domain Overlap, too. You're only two missions away from being promoted to Official Investigator. If you had left all those monsters alive before, you'd probably have been promoted ages ago.\"\n\n\"I want to, but every time I encounter a monster, I can't help but go for the kill.\"\n\nLeave them alive?\n\nImpossible, absolutely no monster could survive at Lu Ding's hands, unless it was some minor creature that only yielded colorless small crystal fragments upon death.\n\nSuddenly, he thought of the last Yin Domain Overlap: \"Didn't I leave some still breathing last time? Those monsters don't count?\"\n\n\"Yes, you did leave some; they were indeed still breathing. But they were *only* breathing. Just a head hanging on by a thread, and they were all insignificant small fry. If those were to count towards promotion, then you'd really be putting us in a difficult position.\"\n\nIt seemed the situation was indeed like that.\n\nThe ones still breathing were all those he hadn't bothered with, hadn't meticulously cut apart.\n\nIt was normal for the Bureau to not value such small fry.\n\n\"I hope you can pay a little attention. Although the Bureau doesn't have a strict requirement, it would help with your promotion and earn you more contribution points. I'll be going now. Wish you a pleasant mission.\"\n\nAs the man walked ahead, the girl following him quietly raised her fist towards Lu Ding in a cheering gesture: \"Go for it, Enforcer Lu!\"\n\n\"Alright, you too, go for it.\"\n\nLu Ding responded to the girl with the same gesture.\n\nJust as he turned to leave.\n\nLooking from afar at the plaza beyond the steps.\n\nA majestic figure approached, carrying a Fish-tail Dual-bladed Hook, his aura sharp, his resolute gaze fixed on Lu Ding.\n\nSeeing the face he had previously seen in the files.\n\nLu Ding exhaled: \"Hah... they really don't let me rest. I've been working non-stop for over twenty hours, fighting several battles, big and small. I'm only nineteen, and you're already using an 'old man endurance' tactic?\"\n\nThough not particularly tired, he was truly unaccustomed to going over twenty hours without sleep.\n\nFor the current Lu Ding, sleep wasn't a necessity, but it was an enjoyment, a physiological habit cultivated over decades.\n\nWithout sleep, he always felt something was missing.\n\n\"Lu Ding, regarding the matters of Cao Family Lane and Xingteng Capital, I hope you can give me an explanation.\"\n\nHearing Cao Ziyang's words, Lu Ding couldn't help but feel annoyed.\n\nHe simply couldn't understand what this person was thinking.\n\n\"You hope? Do others have to fulfill what you hope for? Are you some kind of leader? Do I need to report and explain to you, or do you think carrying a broken hook can scare me?\"\n\nLu Ding's words instantly made Cao Ziyang choke. Officially or privately, it was indeed not his place to question Lu Ding.\n\nBut if he did nothing, he would be letting down his clansmen, his deceased brother, and his parents' nurturing grace.\n\nHe raised his hook, pointing it directly at Lu Ding, but before he could speak,\n\nLu Ding preemptively ended the pointless conversation.\n\n\"Alright, I don't have time to act out a clichéd novel confrontation scene with you here. Our Bureau has a Death Duel Arena with death vows. Sign it now and get on the stage. If you win, what you say goes; whatever you want to hear, I'll tell you. If you lose, you die. It's simple, and I won't have to worry about being confined or penalized.\"\n\n\"Any other words, I don't want to say more. Right now, immediately, are you fighting or not!?\"\n\nWhy so much nonsense?\n\nThey weren't children arguing over who was right or wrong.\n\nLu Ding had originally been pondering how to handle Cao Ziyang, but now, it was fine, no need to think; he had delivered himself directly to the door.\n\nSo, sign the death vow then.\n\nLife and death are fated, wealth and honor depend on Heaven.\n\nThey were all Qi Refiners; their skills were honed for use, not for show. Right or wrong, high or low, would be decided on stage.\n\nCao Ziyang, who had a belly full of words he wanted to say, was choked up again. Before coming, he had never thought of fighting Lu Ding in the Death Duel Arena or signing a death vow. That place was specifically used by Bureau 749 to resolve mortal grudges between Investigators.\n\nAll he wanted was an explanation, an answer.\n\nBut he hadn't considered that Lu Ding wasn't his father, so why should he indulge him? And why should he explain?\n\nThe current situation exceeded Cao Ziyang's expectations.\n\nAt the same time, he was puzzled.\n\nCould it be that Lu Ding couldn't see the gap between him and himself?\n\nDid this Intern Investigator, who had only recently stepped into cultivation, truly believe that by relying on a bit of talent and killing a few Spirit Sea Realm cultivators, he could be so reckless!?\n\nWhy was he so arrogant?\n\nBecause the released notice stated that Cao Yutang had died, but not how he died, Cao Ziyang didn't know that Cao Yutang had been killed by Lu Ding. The details, under the circumstances at the time, he didn't have the mental capacity or inclination to ponder.\n\nAt this moment, Wen Ruchu, who had rushed after him, spoke up: \"Lu Ding, I think there might be a misunderstanding between you and Ziyang. We can just talk it out. It's better to reconcile enemies than to solidify them. Please be understanding towards him, after all, this case involves his family. He's like this right now...\"\n\n\"Alright, you shut up too. What are you, coming here to be a peacemaker and smooth things over when you know nothing? You're no good either. I'll allow both of you to sign, both of you to come up. I'll take you two-on-one. Are you fighting or not!?\"\n\nLu Ding was utterly disgusted by people like Wen Ruchu.\n\nNot understanding the situation at all, he just came out with, 'You're wrong, and you're wrong too, you shouldn't have done this, and you shouldn't have done that.'\n\nNo, do you know the truth of the matter to be playing judge?\n\nFor such people, there was only one way: tear their mouth apart!!\n\nIf he agreed to sign the death vow and get on the Death Duel Arena, then great; Lu Ding would just beat him to death on the stage.\n\nIf he didn't sign, it didn't matter. Lu Ding would follow his thoughts and, after the fight, tear his mouth apart to cure him of his habit of smoothing things over. As for who this person was, what his name was, Lu Ding didn't care.\n\nSince you dared to stand out and mediate without principle, then you must bear the consequences.\n\nWen Ruchu hadn't expected the fire to burn onto him.\n\nHe smiled silently and took a step back.\n\nAlthough his outward appearance was normal, Wen Ruchu was cursing Lu Ding repeatedly in his heart.\n\nCao Ziyang roared in a low voice: \"Sign! Sign immediately, then fight!!\"\n\nHe couldn't care about anything else. Since Lu Ding was so ignorant of his own limits, then he could just use the Death Duel Arena to avenge his younger brother.\n\nYou think your physical body is strong, do you!?\n\nSoon you'll understand that the gap between us cannot be compensated by a seemingly powerful physical body.\n\nAs the onlookers spread the news,\n\nSoon, the entire Bureau 749 knew that Lu Ding and Cao Ziyang were going to sign a death vow and fight in the Death Duel Arena.\n\nOne was Lu Ding, the Intern Investigator who had passed the perfect assessment and bore the brutal nickname \"Corpse-Dissolving Tai Sui.\" His glorious achievements included Zhao Xuan killing a Spirit Sea Realm individual and single-handedly breaching the Yin Domain.\n\nThe other was Cao Ziyang, an established Official Investigator known as the \"Soul Reaper.\" His dual hooks snatched souls and were stained with countless blood. He had once single-handedly entered Ghost Cry Mountain for five long years. Just when everyone thought he had died, he returned forcefully five years later, wielding his Fish-tail Dual-bladed Hook with uncanny and vicious skill.",

    "content": "…..\n\nWithin the hour, 749 was abuzz with discussion.\n\nA life-and-death duel between a new-generation powerhouse and a veteran heavyweight. Had this year's Inaugural Tournament gotten this intense before it had even started?\n\nMany investigators who were idle without missions, or who had temporarily returned to the bureau, began flocking toward the Deathmatch Stage.\n\nAt the very least, they had to watch the show and see what was going on.\n\nEveryone said Lu Ding was ruthless. They wanted to see for themselves just where this ruthlessness lay—was it an empty reputation, or was he truly worthy of his fame?\n\n\"How did Lu Ding end up facing off against Cao Zi'ang? Logically speaking, the two of them shouldn't have crossed paths in a million years. One's an intern, the other's a formal agent.\"\n\n\"Who knows? We're just here for the show, right?\"\n\n\"I know, I know! It's in the latest notice on our bureau's app. The main culprits in that case were Cao Zi'ang's family, and Lu Ding was the one who arrested them. That's probably where the conflict started.\"\n\n\"What? So what? They can't be arrested? You do bad things and it's against the rules to arrest you? What kind of fucking logic is that? He gets arrested for doing his job by the book and now he's being forced into a deathmatch and made to sign a death waiver? Isn't this Cao Zi'ang too much of a bully? Does 749 belong to the Cao family or something!?\"\n\n\"You know, now that you mention it, the more I think about it, the more pissed I get. Why the hell can't they be arrested? What's the big deal if they are?! And now he's forcing someone into a deathmatch over it? Screw this, I gotta hurry and grab a good spot.\"\n\n\"My temper's flaring up, I can't take this. He's pulling strings all the way into 749? Where are we? This is the front line against monsters! You're a 749 investigator yourself, but your family is a disgrace, and you're covering for them?\"\n\nIt was unclear how the rumors started.\n\nBut in the end, through word of mouth, the story became: because Lu Ding arrested Cao Zi'ang's family, Cao Zi'ang couldn't take it and, out of shame and anger, challenged Lu Ding to the Deathmatch Stage.\n\nAnd just like that, it stirred up the dissatisfaction of many people.\n\nWhat was the meaning of this?\n\nOutsiders could be arrested, but if an investigator's relatives did something wrong, they couldn't be? In two words: why the hell not!?\n\nYou talk about fairness and justice, but now you're trying to pull strings and use connections. If you do that, it's inevitable that some people will have higher status and some will have lower status. In the future, doesn't that mean high-status people can do bad things without consequences?\n\nWhat are the low-status people supposed to do?\n\nAs a formal investigator, if you wanted to bully someone a little, fine, no one would bother you. But now you're escalating things to a deathmatch just because a bunch of people who deserved to be arrested were arrested? That was something the others just couldn't stomach.\n\nListening to what these people were saying, it all seemed to make sense.\n\nBut Yan Feifan, who had experienced the real situation, felt that the more he listened, the more something seemed off.\n\nBrother Lu had become the underdog?\n\n*Hiss...*\n\nWasn't it because Brother Lu didn't like to waste time with words that he was the one who called for the Deathmatch Stage and the death waiver? How did it become him being forced by Cao Zi'ang?\n\n*Him* forcing Brother Lu? Was he even worthy? This doesn't seem right.\n\nOn the stage.\n\nThe staff member responsible for notarization brought over the death waiver and an ink pad.\n\n\"Sign your name, then add your handprint.\"\n\nLu Ding immediately put pen to paper, signed his name, and pressed his handprint down.\n\nSeeing him act so decisively, Cao Zi'ang stared at Lu Ding with a cold face as he wrote. \"The odds between you and me are two to eight. If you can tell the truth on this stage in a moment, I can let you off with just an injury and spare your life.\"\n\n\"Hahahahahahaha...\"\n\nLu Ding truly didn't know what to say. Why, why was everyone so full of themselves? Did his appearance really lack that much intimidation?\n\nTwo-to-eight odds. What a joke.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nHearing this, Cao Zi'ang thought he had agreed.\n\nThen Lu Ding continued, \"I will satisfy your request.\"\n\nLittle did he know, what Lu Ding meant to satisfy was his death wish.\n\nWasn't it two-to-eight odds?\n\nAs Lu Ding stepped onto the stage, Cao Zi'ang pressed down his handprint, his expression relaxing. \"You're sensible, at least. In that case, I will allow you some dignity and let you witness my full power.\"\n\nHe formed a hand seal and pressed it to his chest. Inch by inch, scales surged forth, covering his entire body. Fish patterns coiled around him, the scales arranged in dense, overlapping rows. It was quite a fine suit of Fish-Scale Body Armor.\n\nCao Zi'ang leaped onto the stage.\n\nBelow the Deathmatch Stage, the investigators wore strange expressions. This damn Cao Zi'ang was completely shameless. Although Lu Ding had a great reputation, you were a veteran formal investigator fighting an intern, yet you still used a high-level technique like the General's Body Armor.\n\nHave you no shame!\n\nWatching this scene, other investigators immediately shouted at Lu Ding on the stage.\n\n\"Lu Ding, don't be fucking scared of him! His General's Body Armor hasn't been fully mastered! It doesn't cover his legs, attack his lower body!\"\n\n\"Lu Ding, you better not die! Beat him just like you beat me! Get him!!!\" yelled Xue Ning, the Little Tyrant, from below.\n\nAlthough he and Lu Ding had had a very unpleasant encounter before, he was thoroughly convinced after he woke up. Genuinely and completely convinced.\n\nIf you have the strength, you have the right to be arrogant!\n\nIf you don't have strength, you keep it bottled up. But if you have strength and still keep it bottled up, what was the point of training in the first place? To be a turtle hiding in its shell forever?¹\n\nBesides, he had also heard what the other investigators were saying. Xue Ning himself was arrogant and looked down on others, but if he had encountered what Jia Yuanfang and Cao Yuan had done, he would have arrested them too!\n\nNow Lu Ding was being forced by Cao Zi'ang to sign a death waiver and fight on the Deathmatch Stage just for arresting those people. If he encountered something similar in the future after making an arrest and someone else came to force him into a fight, what kind of bullshit would that be?\n\nIf I stand by and watch coldly today, when disaster strikes me tomorrow, will there be no one to cheer me on?\n\nIn this fight today, if Cao Zi'ang lost, he deserved it. If Cao Zi'ang won, his future days wouldn't be easy either.\n\nAs for whether he could win?\n\nCao Zi'ang was certain he could win, would win, that it was a sure win. He listened to the hostile voices from below that were steadily growing louder.\n\n\"Yes, my General's Body Armor isn't fully mastered. But you are merely physically strong. As long as I keep my distance, you have no chance of winning.\"\n\nLu Ding stared at his feet, his gaze somewhat focused. It couldn't even cover the feet?\n\nBut in Cao Zi'ang's eyes, this look had another meaning. He said, \"Stop dreaming. Get ready.\"\n\n\"I haven't said a word. That doesn't mean I'm dreaming. Stop trying to guess what others are thinking. I was just wondering why someone would use the General's Body Armor technique so shittily, so ugly that it can't even cover the legs.\"\n\nAs it happened, he knew the General's Body Armor technique too.\n\nHe lifted his hand and formed a seal. A ball of black, ethereal flame ignited out of thin air in Lu Ding's palm.\n\nHe suddenly flung it out before him, pulling forth a serpent of fire. Black energy rose, and as the flames erupted, a figure walked out from within, clad in the Armor of the Four Vicious Beasts, Shrouded in Dark Light, brimming with a majestic, murderous aura. His Boots of Stepping on Clouds and Mountains of Withered Bone trod the stage, and the Rebirth Pearl on his waist glimmered with brilliant light. Blades could not pierce it, arrows could not harm it.\n\nThe ferocity of the four beasts was on full display, stunning everyone present.\n\n\"How do you know the General's Body Armor technique!?\"\n\nLu Ding raised his hand. \"It's not just the General's Body Armor. I know much more. Go ask your uncle in the afterlife.\"\n\nSpiritual energy surged. A devastating slash erupted, like a sudden gale, tearing through and annihilating everything in its path.\n\n***\n\n¹An adaptation of the idiom \"千年王八萬年龜，改不了縮頭烏龜的種,\" which literally means \"A thousand-year-old bastard turtle, a ten-thousand-year-old tortoise, can't change its nature as a cowardly, head-withdrawing turtle.\" It criticizes cowardice.",

    "content": "......\n\nAt this moment, Cao Zi'ang finally realized something was wrong, but Lu Ding's move was too decisive, a killing blow right from the start, at least that's what he thought.\n\nEverything was too late.\n\nStrikes surging from all directions enveloped him, tearing apart his amateurish General's Armor Attachment Technique, along with his flesh and blood, cutting and severing.\n\nTwo seconds passed.\n\nLu Ding lowered his arm. Cao Zi'ang, who had been standing in the center, was now scattered on the ground, leaving conspicuous, glaring crimson traces.\n\n\"Two-eight...\"¹\n\nIndeed, it was a two-eight split: eight hundred and eighty-eight cuts in two seconds.\n\nHowever, Cao Zi'ang's death wasn't in vain.\n\nAt the very least, his death helped Lu Ding test how much the General's Armor Attachment improved his stats.\n\nOverall, it was quite good.\n\nBut only \"quite good,\" yet it had a crucial point:\n\nCool!\n\nAmong the crowd below, the atmosphere had been dead silent ever since he deployed the General's Armor Attachment.\n\nThese people suddenly felt, had they overthought things?\n\nWas it possible that Cao Zi'ang felt his entire family had been arrested, and there was no point in him living, so he sought out Lu Ding for a deathmatch platform?\n\nHow *dare* you?!\n\nA perfected General's Armor Attachment Technique—even if you just stood there and let others hack at you, many probably wouldn't be able to cut through it.\n\nThis was no joke.\n\nThe General's Armor Attachment was effective but difficult to master. Those who could perfect it were all absolute badasses.\n\nNot to mention, Lu Ding had previously made a name for himself with his physical body. Add this perfected General's Armor Attachment, and it was like adding wings to a tiger.\n\nBai Hemian watched the entire process, his eyes full of approval. Exactly!\n\nIt was precisely such a person who deserved to be his friend.\n\nOnly by befriending someone with depth, strength, talent, and culture could they mutually improve, learn together, and progress together.\n\nBai Hemian's only complaint was that Lu Ding was too low-key.\n\nWith such strength and talent, to actually be provoked by such an insignificant troublemaker.\n\n\"He... he's still too tolerant.\"\n\n\"Grandma was right after all. Those with inner strength never bother with pointless displays. This is true power.\"\n\n\"Patrolman Lu, look this way.\"\n\nAs a female voice rang out, *click*.\n\nJi Yanshuang pressed the camera shutter. Lu Ding's image was frozen at that moment: a triangular composition from bottom to top, with Lu Ding in the center, clad in the Blacklight Four-Beast Ferocious Combat Armor. On the left, clouds churned across the sky, obscuring the sun; on the right, the sky was clear and cloudless, a uniform blue.\n\nSunlight fell on the side of his face, one side bright, one side dark. His messy hair was lifted by a gentle breeze, then frozen by the camera at that perfect moment.\n\nJi Yanshuang looked at the photo, involuntarily covering her mouth.\n\nShe herself hadn't expected it. Concerned enough to come watch, then joyful at Lu Ding's victory, she only wished to preserve his glory at that moment, but unexpectedly captured such an atmospheric photo.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding was somewhat puzzled by Ji Yanshuang's presence there.\n\nHe didn't walk over. They were merely acquaintances, and there was nothing much to say. Moreover, Lu Ding had more important matters to attend to.\n\nThe decisions he made, except for the last time with Cao Yutang when no complete corpse was left behind.\n\nThe rest, he had fulfilled one by one.\n\nThis time, he had said in his heart that he would tear Wen Ruchu's mouth apart.\n\nHis figure flew towards Wen Ruchu in the crowd.\n\nSeeing Lu Ding flying towards him in armor, Wen Ruchu was startled for a moment. Why was he flying towards *him*?\n\nHe hadn't provoked Lu Ding, had he? In his mind and his understanding, a few words were hardly a provocation.\n\nHowever, if Lu Ding hadn't been strong and assertive, he might genuinely have been led astray by him and Cao Zi'ang's good-cop-bad-cop routine.\n\nWen Ruchu turned to run.\n\nAlthough he didn't know how he had provoked Lu Ding, running was always the safest bet, right?\n\nHe didn't believe he could defeat this person.\n\nHe couldn't even defeat Cao Zi'ang; otherwise, he wouldn't have always stuck by others.\n\nHe turned around.\n\nBai Hemian stood with his arms crossed. \"Where are you going?\"\n\nFrom behind, Lu Ding's voice came. \"You seem to enjoy playing the peacemaker² quite a lot?\"\n\nWen Ruchu turned back and forth, finally looking at Lu Ding, his expression innocent, and always wearing a gentle smile. Not a hint of panic could be seen on his face.\n\n\"Lu Ding, is there some misunderstanding between us?\"\n\n\"You just said that too. You said there was a misunderstanding between me and Cao Zi'ang. Now that the misunderstanding between him and me is resolved, it's time for the misunderstanding between you and me.\"\n\nCao Zi'ang was scattered all over the ground. Was *he* going to be scattered all over the ground too?\n\nWen Ruchu took a step back. \"Lu... Lu Ding, we didn't sign a death pact. If you kill me, you'll be punished, and it won't be as simple as being confined.\"\n\n*Thwack*.\n\nA pair of hands reached from behind and pressed him down. A desolate, eerie spiritual energy surged into his body, controlling his movements. Bai Hemian's voice brushed past his ear: \"Just don't move.\"\n\nLu Ding stepped forward with one hand and clamped down on the man's mouth.\n\nYan Feifan pushed through the onlookers, drew out the short knife he had used to chop Ma Qi last time, and handed it to Lu Ding.\n\n\"Brother Lu, this guy's mouth isn't clean. Use a knife.\"\n\nRight.\n\nLu Ding reversed his grip on the short knife, twirled it in his hand, and in a blink, the short knife was sheathed.\n\nBlood dripped.\n\nBai Hemian released him. Wen Ruchu clutched his mouth, blood seeping through his fingers. His gaze towards Lu Ding was filled with fear and bewilderment.\n\nBut not a trace of resentment.\n\nHis own talent was excellent, so he understood how terrifying it was for Lu Ding to possess such combat power in such a short time since joining 749.\n\nHe was not qualified to contend with someone like that; he would only court disaster.\n\n\"Very good, I'm very satisfied with that look in your eyes. You're a smart person, so I hope next time I don't see you standing around, generously offering others' sacrifices³ and playing the peacemaker, especially when you don't understand the situation. Otherwise, what rots won't just be your mouth. Understand?\"\n\nOnly now did Wen Ruchu finally understand the reason. As the saying goes, disaster comes from the mouth.\n\nHe nodded, not daring to speak, then fled the scene as if escaping.\n\nLu Ding dispelled his General's Armor Attachment and walked away. He was going back to sleep!\n\nAfter more than twenty hours, it was finally over. The Ghost Festival was in three days, and he needed to get some good rest.\n\nOnly after he left did the discussions completely erupt.\n\nSomeone sighed.\n\n\"This year's four monstrous newcomers: Bai Hemian, the Pilgrim of Trials⁴; Tantai Xuanyue, the Jade Guanyin⁵; Wen Ruchu, the Amiable Immortal Official⁶; and Lu Ding, the Cadaver-Deciphering Grand Duke⁷. We thought Lu Ding was the weakest, but he insta-killed Cao Zi'ang with one move?\"\n\n\"The Amiable Immortal Official Wen Ruchu was just intimidated by his aura and wanted to flee without fighting. Bai Hemian, the Pilgrim of Trials, is his friend. Cao Zi'ang, the veteran investigator and Soul-Reaping Emissary, is a departed soul by his hand. Should we just not compete for the top three in this Inaugural Martial Arts Debate⁸ today?\"\n\n\"Hmm... You wouldn't dare fight Lu Ding because you don't know if he'll insta-kill you. You can't beat Bai Hemian. Only facing Tantai Xuanyue might give you a chance. Third place is still up for grabs.\"\n\n\"Fighting Tantai Xuanyue? That also seems a bit unrealistic, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It's better than trying to snatch first or second place from those two, right?\"\n\n\"You've got a point. So, let's focus on studying Tantai Xuanyue and snatching her third place!\"\n\n\"Fighting Lu Ding and Bai Hemian is out of the question. I still have the guts to try with Tantai Xuanyue.\"\n\nAt this moment, Tantai Xuanyue had no idea that a large wave of people, specifically studying her combat style and magical flaws, was about to surge towards her.\n\n---\n¹ \"Two-eight\": Refers to \"two seconds to cut you eight hundred and eighty-eight times.\" It's a specific, blunt phrase used by Lu Ding.\n² \"Playing the peacemaker\": Lit. \"mixing mud.\" An idiom referring to someone who mediates in an indecisive way, glosses over differences, or avoids taking a stand.\n³ \"Generously offering others' sacrifices\": An idiom referring to someone who gives advice or offers solutions that sound good but require someone else's effort, expense, or sacrifice.\n⁴ \"Pilgrim of Trials\" (几经浮屠): A title implying one who has undergone many trials, journeys, or spiritual transformations, akin to a pilgrim visiting many pagodas (浮屠, fú tú).\n⁵ \"Jade Guanyin\" (玉观音): Guanyin is the Buddhist Bodhisattva of Compassion.\n⁶ \"Amiable Immortal Official\" (和煦仙官): A title suggesting a gentle and kind demeanor.\n⁷ \"Cadaver-Deciphering Grand Duke\" (解屍太歲): \"Tai Sui\" (太歲) refers to the Grand Duke of Jupiter, a powerful deity in Chinese folk religion and astrology.

    "content": "...\n\nAs Lu Ding departed, Ji Yanshuang searched around but couldn't find him. A touch of regret stirred in her heart. It wasn't that she wanted anything to happen between them; she simply felt she should thank him.\n\nWhat might have been a casual act for Lu Ding was a life-saving grace for Ji Yanshuang.\n\nIn the eyes of ordinary people, she might be a young lady from a wealthy family, a second-generation rich kid. But after stepping into the world of Qi Refiners, she understood that she was merely a passerby, not skilled in combat, with talent but not exceptional.\n\nSomeone like Lu Ding, to her, was like stars in the sky or the moon in the water.¹\n\nUnreachable and unattainable, she felt a sense of shame at her own inadequacy.\n\nThey say that in one's youth, one shouldn't encounter someone too astonishing, lest they be fixated on them for a lifetime. At this moment, Ji Yanshuang seemed to understand.\n\n\"You must always stand in the light.\"\n\nJi Yanshuang stood still, gazing into the distance, as the gentle breeze swayed her white dress, brushing past her face and swirling around her dimples.\n\n…..\n\nOn the way to Baofan District.\n\nLu Ding looked at Bai Hemian, who was traveling with them: \"Do you have something to do in the city?\"\n\n\"Before my last mission, I had some clothes made at a shop. I've been in isolation for too long this time; I need to pick them up.\"\n\n\"Where is it? We can drop you off. We're not in a hurry anyway; we're just idle today.\"\n\nLu Ding thought Bai Hemian was a good person.\n\nAnd he had just helped block the one who loved to smooth things over.\n\nIt's just giving someone a lift; it doesn't take much time.\n\nAfter giving the location, Bai Hemian hesitated slightly before asking: \"Lu Ding, is there a complete version of that poem from last time?\"\n\nHe felt he might be a little presumptuous.\n\nBut his name was in the poem, and Bai Hemian couldn't find it online or hear the complete version. He always felt like something was missing in his heart.\n\n\"Yes, there is.\"\n\nLu Ding recited it off the cuff:\n\n\"Azure peaks touch the sky, carefree, unmindful of the years.\nParting clouds to seek ancient paths, leaning on stones to hear the flowing springs.\nFlowers warm, the green ox reclines; pines tall, the white crane sleeps.\nWords come, the river's hue dims with dusk; alone, descends through the cold mist.\"\n\n\"Whoa, Lu Ge, when did you start writing poetry? This is really good! When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm in a beautiful, tranquil immortal realm, with white cranes flapping their wings and green oxen lying in the fields, like living in reclusion.\"\n\nLu Ding turned his head, his tone helpless: \"Fan Ge, can you open your eyes? You're driving, and this is a highway.\"\n\n\"Oh oh hahaha, my bad, Lu Ge, I was just so immersed! It's well-written, truly damn good.\"\n\n\"I really don't know what to do with you. You should watch fewer short videos.\"\n\nTheir casual chat didn't interrupt Bai Hemian's thoughts.\n\nListening to Lu Ding's poem.\n\nHe felt as if he had returned to the small mountain village where he was born and raised, where a gentle breeze carried the scent of flowers, and he led his family's water buffalo across small bridges and flowing streams... back to the home he shared with his grandmother halfway up the mountain, where the chirping of birds filled the air in the morning, and the clatter of pots and pans came from the kitchen—Grandma was making him breakfast.\n\n\"Xiao Bai, you're going to be late, hurry up and get up to eat.\"\n\nHis eyes gradually welled up.\n\nBai Hemian knew, he couldn't go back. Nothing could go back.\n\nHe pressed the window down, letting the wind dry the lingering tears in the corners of his eyes: \"It's beautifully written. Can I copy it down?\"\n\n\"Go ahead, it's fine. I copied it too.\"\n\nAt Lu Ding's words, Bai Hemian simply managed a smile he thought was gentle.\n\nEntering the city.\n\nUpon arriving at the place Bai Hemian specified, he got out of the car and then looked back: \"Lu Ding, you gave me a poem, so I'll give you a piece of clothing.\"\n\nLu Ding looked at his own black short-sleeved shirt, which faintly highlighted his muscle lines underneath.\n\nLu Ding didn't have many clothes indeed.\n\nHe had suffered significant losses during this period.\n\nNow that Bai Hemian had offered, Lu Ding certainly wouldn't be polite with him. After all, how much could a piece of clothing be worth?\n\nIt's the thought that counts.\n\nHe'd return the favor next time.\n\n\"Sure, then I'll thank you first. But could you send a few more? Otherwise, I won't have anything to change into.\"\n\nBai Hemian looked at him: \"Okay.\"\n\nThen he turned and walked away without looking back.\n\nYan Feifan was deep in thought, not starting the car for a long time. The traffic light had already changed, but Lu Ding didn't urge him. He wanted to see what the man was thinking and if he would be embarrassed when he snapped out of it.\n\nAs it turned out.\n\nThe moment Yan Feifan came back to his senses, he blurted out: \"Lu Ge, how about I give you a gift too?\"\n\nLu Ding: ?????\n\n\"You didn't secretly look at my ID, did you?\"\n\n\"No, why would you say that?\" Yan Feifan didn't understand why Lu Ding would say that.\n\n\"No wonder you don't know my birthday. You're preparing a gift for me so early. It's still a long way off, no rush. Just send me something good when it's my birthday.\"\n\nThis time, Yan Feifan understood; Lu Ge's humor had resurfaced.\n\nHe didn't say anything else, just stepped on the gas and left.\n\nIt wasn't about being formal. It was mainly that Yan Feifan felt he had gained a lot of benefits following Lu Ge, like this time.\n\nLu Ding was the main investigator for the vampire case, and he received 180 contribution points. Yan Feifan, who just tagged along and did odd jobs, got 100—an astronomical figure he couldn't have even imagined before.\n\nIf he tried to transfer them to Lu Ding, Lu Ding definitely wouldn't accept.\n\nNow that Bai Hemian had mentioned a gift, it dawned on Yan Feifan that he could prepare a gift for Lu Ge!\n\nAs for what to send, he still needed to think it over carefully.\n\nBack at the Public Security Bureau.\n\nLu Ding got out of the car and walked ahead, thinking he'd go back and have a good, long sleep first.\n\n\"Damn, Lu Ge, are you really that handsome?!!\"\n\nYan Feifan's shout almost made Lu Ding think something else had happened.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nYan Feifan quickly walked over and handed him his phone. It displayed photos Ji Yanshuang had taken today, with a caption below:\n\n【Victory Settlement】\n\nAnd a string of comments followed:\n\n【So strong and handsome, my favorite!】\n\n【No more words needed, tip! Must tip right away! This photo is too tasteful. If I ever get famous someday, I want to be photographed like this.】\n\n【Professional photographer, amazing Lu Ding, strong alliance, I declare this the most handsome promotional photo of the year!】\n\n【Ji Yanshuang, when did a photographer named Ji Yanshuang join the Information Integration Department of the bureau? These photos are so evocative! Can you privately take some photos for me? I want them for my wallpaper.】\n\n【I admit that from this angle, Lu Ding even makes me feel inferior. This time, I'll let you win.】\n\n【Hahahahaha, awesome, awesome! Since you're so handsome, dare to reveal your name?】\n\nThe Information Integration Department was one of 749's logistical departments. Things like 749's forum were managed by them, and they also planned various activities. They were mostly Qi Refiners who were not good at combat.\n\nAfter all, 749 was an organization; it couldn't possibly be composed entirely of combat personnel.\n\n\"Am I that handsome?\"\n\n\"Handsome! Hardcore handsome, handsome without embellishment, from the inside out, whether it's personal charisma or external features. If our bureau selected a third-place scholar,² that position would definitely belong to you, Lu Ge.\"\n\nSeeing Yan Feifan's sincerity, complete with a thumbs-up, Lu Ding's already good mood got even better.\n\n\"Since they've taken such nice photos of me, reward them, and generously too!\"\n\nLu Ding pulled out his phone, and in a rare display of generosity, he tipped ten contribution points.\n\nOutside the Public Security Bureau, Cao Ying saw Lu Ding standing in the courtyard.\n\nHaving waited for a long time, Cao Ying quickly got out of his car and shouted from afar: \"Inspector Lu, I've brought you treasures!\"\n\nThe guards at the gate immediately raised their guns.\n\nEver since the Netherworld Incident, when a complainant had driven in by force, these guards were on high alert.\n\nIt wasn't that the complainant had done anything wrong; it was just too dangerous for her to do that. Lu Ding and the others were Qi Refiners, true, but the other people in the bureau were ordinary folks. If someone had been hit, it would have been a huge mess.\n\nAnd Cao Ying's attire certainly didn't look like that of a good person.\n\nWhat decent person wears a suit bare-chested with a necklace?\n\n\"Don't shoot, it's me, I'm Cao Ying, Inspector Lu, I'm here to bring you treasures.\"\n\n\"Cao Ying?\"\n\nLu Ding waved, signaling the guards to let him in.\n\nTaking two steps forward, Cao Ying pulled out a Ganoderma Man and Ganoderma Horse, wrapped in Spiritual Qi, from his embrace: \"Good things that enhance cultivation, break through realms, and extend life! Inspector Lu, come, take a look?\"\n\nLu Ding was just fretting about not having enough contribution points to exchange for heavenly and earthly treasures to expand his Spiritual Sea.\n\nWell, well.\n\nSomeone's delivering it!!!\n\n---\n¹ Literally \"stars in the sky, moon in the water,\" an idiom referring to something beautiful but unreachable or illusory.\n² Refers to 探花 (tànhuā), the third-place recipient in the highest imperial examination, often associated with exceptional talent and good looks.",

    "content": "......\n\nLu Ding took the man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma from Cao Ying's hands. It felt warm and smooth like jade, yet also had the texture of a fungus.\n\nNow free from the envelope of Cao Ying's spiritual Qi, a faint, refreshing fragrance wafted from the damaged spot on the Ganoderma's top, invigorating the senses.\n\nNoticing Lu Ding's gaze fall upon the damaged area, Cao Ying said a bit sheepishly, \"I gave the cap to my old man. He's been trying to break through to the Divine Palace Realm for ages without any progress. Eating the cap should help him break through sooner.\"\n\nHe felt a little embarrassed saying it himself.\n\nWho gives a gift that's only half there?\n\nBut it was truly a good item. Even without the cap, its medicinal properties were far beyond what ordinary heavenly and earthly treasures could compare to.\n\n\"This must have taken a lot of effort, right?\"\n\nAlthough Lu Ding didn't know the details, he knew that this man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma was something the Tianli Cult would kill for.\n\nFor just a Wind-settling Pearl that could get them onto Mount Dingfeng, that group had dared to ambush a 749 Investigator.\n\nOne could only imagine how much they valued the man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma.\n\nAnd now Cao Ying had just gone and snatched it?\n\n\"It was alright. They couldn't handle me, but we lost a lot of brothers.\"\n\nHearing Cao Ying's words, Lu Ding looked at the man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma. It was a good thing, and he wanted it; it was exactly what he needed right now.\n\nThree days was just enough time to use this Ganoderma, along with his remaining contribution points exchanged for other heavenly and earthly treasures, to advance his realm.\n\nSo he accepted the item.\n\nBut not for free.\n\n\"I'll take it. Thank you. But I won't take it for nothing. If you have any trouble in the future, come straight to me. As long as it’s not a matter of principle, I don’t care about right or wrong, I won’t ask about the specifics—I’ll just be on your side.\"\n\nA smile tugged at the corners of Cao Ying's mouth that he couldn't suppress no matter how he tried.\n\nThose words offered so much security, and they were exactly what he needed.\n\nIn fact, they exceeded his expectations.\n\n\"Thank you, Patrol Enforcer Lu. Then I'll let you get back to it, I have to go. The funeral arrangements for my brothers haven't been made yet. I need to send money to their families, and for those who live far away, I need to go pick up their parents.\"\n\nWhen treasure hunters¹ died in the mountains, not all of them were loners.\n\nMany had their own parents, wives, and children.\n\nThey were all Cao Ying's brothers, and he couldn't just abandon them. They died for him, and now that he was the big boss of Cao Family Alley, their wives, children, and elders would be cared for by Cao Family Alley from now on.\n\nThe two waved goodbye.\n\nBefore leaving with the man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma, Lu Ding instructed Yan Feifan, \"I'm going to be cultivating for the next few days. I'll have to trouble you with the miscellaneous tasks. If anything comes up that you can't handle, come get me.\"\n\n\"Aiya, Brother Lu, what trouble? It's no trouble at all! Don't you worry, I've got everything covered.\"\n\n....\n\nBack in his room, Lu Ding exchanged all his remaining contribution points for heavenly and earthly treasures.\n\nHis bag was clean again, not a single point left.\n\nAs for saving some for a rainy day?\n\nSave them, my ass. How much could he even save? A few measly points wouldn't do a damn thing. Better to use them now to boost his strength.\n\nSoon enough.\n\nThe same familiar delivery.\n\nLu Ding tore open the cardboard box and took out the heavenly and earthly treasures he had exchanged for.\n\nA Black Spirit Ginseng that grew in a place with excellent Feng Shui, absorbing the earth's Qi as it grew. It was the size and shape of a fragrant pear and was jet-black, costing ninety contribution points.\n\nAnd a Coffin Fungus that had grown inside the coffin of an ancient corpse, costing eighty contribution points.\n\nNormally, heavenly and earthly treasures needed to be refined into pills or prepared into medicinal powders or soups using secret techniques to be effective.\n\nBut!\n\nAll these procedures were merely to better absorb the medicinal properties within the treasures.\n\nLu Ding had the skill, Forgotten Form, which allowed him to achieve Oneness with Heaven and Man.\n\nThese heavenly and earthly treasures were also born of heaven and earth.\n\nIf other people ate heavenly and earthly treasures raw, they might absorb twenty percent of their medicinal properties. If refined into a pill, they might absorb fifty percent.\n\nBut Lu Ding? He absorbed one hundred percent!!!\n\nHe picked up the Black Spirit Ginseng, the Coffin Fungus, and the man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma and started gnawing on them directly.\n\nThe taste was mediocre, but the effects were immediate.\n\nWithin his Spiritual Sea, the liquefied spiritual Qi was like a raging ocean, sending waves several meters high crashing against the shore. With a series of rumbles, the coastline expanded, and the world trembled.\n\nOutside, countless streams of worldly spiritual Qi, guided by heaven and earth, rushed towards him, each scrambling to be first, as if afraid of being too slow.\n\nWitnessing this terrifying sight, Yan Feifan's jaw dropped.\n\n\"That's Brother Lu for you...\"\n\nComparisons are odious. He and others *absorbed* worldly spiritual Qi; Brother Lu *pumped* it—no, that wasn't quite right. It was more like he *drew* it, as in drawing water from a well.\n\nIf the spiritual Qi that filled the world was an endless ocean, then Lu Ding was like someone who tied a rope to an iron bucket, tossed it into the water, and hauled it back up. It was even easier than that; the bucket *was* the spiritual Qi he needed.\n\nOthers were like people trying to drink through a ten-meter-long straw, sucking until they were dizzy and exhausted.\n\nIncomparable. Utterly incomparable.\n\nThree days passed in a flash.\n\nLu Ding had perfectly absorbed the medicinal power, and his realm shot up from Spiritual Sea Level Two, jumping three levels to Spiritual Sea Level Five. For anyone else, these medicines would have likely pushed them through one level at the absolute most.\n\nBreaking through realms was only a secondary effect of the man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma. Its primary function was to extend one's lifespan and restore the body to its peak state.\n\nBut this primary function was useless to Lu Ding. He was still young, only nineteen, with a long life ahead of him. Plus, he was already at his peak.\n\nStill, it didn't matter. The extra was just extra. Who would complain about living too long?\n\nThe visualized Spiritual Sea within his body had already expanded into an inland sea, a true spiritual 'sea' in every sense of the word. Compared to the data on Spiritual Sea Level Five recorded in the 749 app, Lu Ding's Spiritual Sea was larger by an unknown magnitude.\n\nThe main point of divergence was this:\n\nThe literature stated that opening up the Spiritual Sea was very painful, and the difficulty of overcoming the barriers varied. But for Lu Ding, difficulty?\n\nThere was no difficulty. Once the medicinal efficacy was sufficient, he simply expanded and repaired at the same time.\n\nWhat was that saying? Grasp both quality and quantity, let cultivation and strength both blossom.\n\nBarriers?\n\nThey didn't exist.\n\nAs for pain...\n\nAfter eating the heavenly and earthly treasures, he just felt a warm sensation spreading through him, a bullish strength he couldn't seem to use up. He felt an urge to find some demons and ghosts to beat up.\n\nAt this moment, he was stabilizing his new realm.\n\nBaofan District, the Rotten Shipyard.\n\nA group from the Tianli Cult hid in the cabin of a haphazardly moored, derelict boat.\n\nA map of Baofan District was spread out before them.\n\nOn it, the Public Security Administration Office and Cao Family Alley were circled in red.\n\n\"I'll repeat the plan one more time. Today is the Ghost Festival. Once midnight passes, the yin and yang will shift. At that time, Lu Ding probably won't be paying attention to Cao Family Alley.\"\n\n\"We'll use this opportunity to raid Cao Family Alley, capture Cao Ying, and take back the man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma.\"\n\n\"To prevent any unexpected situations, Zhou Lie, Guang Fei, you two go to the Public Security Administration to monitor Lu Ding's every move. If he shows any sign of heading toward Cao Family Alley to provide support, send us a message.\"\n\n\"Peng Zishi, Jin Chenghua, you two go plant the Baleful Lures. Plant them in the east to draw Lu Ding over there.\"\n\n\"The rest of you, attack Cao Family Alley with me. Capture Cao Ying alive!!!\"\n\nThe one-eyed man spoke with resounding conviction.\n\nThree days. It had been three days since Cao Ying stole his man-and-horse-shaped Ganoderma!!!\n\nAt the same time, he hated Lu Ding to the core. He, a grand branch leader of the Tianli Cult, actually had to be wary of a 749 intern investigator. An INTERN!!!!\n\nThe thought made the one-eyed man's blood boil.\n\nYet, there was nothing he could do about this intern. He was just too strong!!\n\nBefore, when Lu Ding was in Yunhai, he hadn't dared to openly seek trouble with him, so he'd planned to wait for an opportunity, to use the Ghost Festival as cover to fish in troubled waters.\n\nBut then Lu Ding started changing day by day, killing this person one day and that person the next. He had only quieted down these past three days, and the one-eyed man had no idea what he was up to.\n\n***\n*Footnotes:*\n¹ *Treasure hunters:* The original term is `憋寶人` (biē bǎo rén), a specific type of treasure hunter from Chinese folklore who often uses esoteric means to find treasures and must abide by strict rules, such as maintaining silence during the hunt.",

    "content": "The more Liu Xingchuan thought about Lu Ding killing the one-eyed man, the more numb he felt. The more people Lu Ding killed, the more terrified he became.\n\nFinally, it came to Cao Yutang, then the vampire, then the soul-reaping emissary, Cao Zi'ang.\n\nHe watched as the cultivation level and strength of the dead grew closer and closer to his own.\n\nThe one-eyed man had an epiphany. He finally got it!\n\nFine. Impressive. Lu Ding, you're the real deal. I'll even give you a round of applause. I won't provoke you anymore, okay? Besides, the Wind-settling Pearl isn't in your hands anymore anyway.\n\nLet's just call it even on our past grievances.\n\nI won't hold a grudge for you stealing my pearl. Let's just go our separate ways.\n\nThe pearl is with Cao Ying now anyway, and the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse are in his hands too.\n\nSo I can go after Cao Ying, right?\n\nThat's none of your business, is it? You just had a run-in with the Cao family yourself. I'm going after them now—you should be happy about that, right?\n\nAnd so, Liu Xingchuan, the branch leader of the Heavenly Principle Cult, caught between humiliation and anger, chose to swallow his impotent rage.\n\nNo, seriously, is there something wrong with Lu Ding?\n\nIs he insane!?\n\nYou have this much power, and you're an intern investigator? Wouldn't it be better to get promoted to a full investigator? What are you doing?\n\nCan't you kill fewer people and more monsters? And the Cao family are a bunch of morons, too. Why did you go and disturb him at work!\n\nIf he killed more monsters, wouldn't he get promoted?\n\nThe very thought that he, a dignified branch leader of the Heavenly Principle Cult, had to be wary of a mere 749 intern investigator, made Liu Xingchuan's composure crack.\n\nEven a full investigator would have been understandable, but an *intern*.\n\nIt'd be a disgrace if word got out.\n\n\"Haaa...\"\n\n\"Branch Leader, it's been three days. What if Cao Ying has already eaten the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse?\"\n\nFaced with his subordinate's question, Liu Xingchuan stared over with his one eye. \"He won't. According to my intelligence, Cao Ying has been busy settling the affairs of his deceased subordinates' families these past few days. Besides, refining the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse into a pill can't be done that quickly.\"\n\n\"Eating them raw would be a waste. Cao Ying is a Treasure Keeper¹, after all; he wouldn't do something so clueless.\"\n\n\"So the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse must still be there. As long as we grab them, we'll retreat immediately. There won't be any mishaps.\"\n\nIn short: it was a sure thing. A very sure thing.\n\nLiu Xingchuan was also very confident. This open gambit of his was unbeatable. So what if Lu Ding found out?\n\nOn one side, you have the monsters; on the other, Cao Family Alley.\n\nYou can't possibly ignore the monsters to deal with Cao Family Alley, right?\n\nBesides, the monster outbreak happens first, and we go to Cao Family Alley to grab our target after. By the time you, Lu Ding, arrive at the front lines of the monster battle, how are you supposed to get back? Doesn't that take time?\n\nDo you really think all monsters are cabbages, just standing there waiting for you to chop them down?\n\nYou're strong, your power is strong, your talent is strong, but there has to be a limit, a period for growth!!\n\nThis round, he, Liu Xingchuan, was guaranteed to win!\n\nThe members of the Heavenly Principle Cult analyzed it and agreed that it made a lot of sense.\n\nThere was just one small problem: the personal safety of Zhou Lie and Guang Fei.\n\nThis Lu Ding was a ruthless character who could tear a body to shreds without batting an eye.\n\nIf the two of them were discovered while monitoring Lu Ding's movements...\n\nFeeling all eyes turn to them, Zhou Lie puffed out his chest.\n\n\"No worries. If we're discovered... in a fight, I know for a fact I can't beat him. I have a clear assessment of my own strength.\"\n\nNext to him, Guang Fei chimed in, arms crossed, \"But when it comes to running away, we're no slouches.\"\n\nEveryone nodded. That made sense.\n\nThe two were famous for their excellent movement techniques; otherwise, Liu Xingchuan wouldn't have assigned them to monitor Lu Ding.\n\n\"Very good. Then get ready. At eleven o'clock, we'll officially set out and split up.\"\n\nTime ticked by, second by second.\n\nToday was the Ghost Festival, the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month. According to folk tradition, people tried to avoid going out after dark.\n\nSo, many people had returned home early.\n\nEspecially late at night.\n\nBut, of course, a lot of young people didn't buy into that. Ghost Festival this, Ghost Festival that—for them, life began after nightfall.\n\n10:50 PM.\n\nLu Ding pulled open the door to see Yan Feifan standing there, holding several large and small bags.\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\n\"Brother Lu, these are the clothes Bai Hemian dropped off this afternoon. You were cultivating, so he left first. He's on call for support duty tonight because of the Ghost Festival.\"\n\nLu Ding took the bags.\n\nHe casually opened one.\n\nWhen he pulled the garment out, his eyes lit up.\n\nDamn. You'll have to admit it.\n\nA civil-military sleeve robe² with a black-and-white contrasting python pattern, the python design outlined with gold thread. It looked expensive at a glance. Even before putting it on, Lu Ding knew this thing would look incredibly cool on him!\n\nIt was just a bit too eye-catching to wear out, this being the modern era.\n\nNext was the second bag: a full custom-tailored suit in a dark color, exuding handsomeness and elegance from top to bottom.\n\nAlthough the suit was also handsome, Lu Ding still preferred the civil-military sleeves.\n\nThe suit was handsome; the civil-military sleeves were handsome *and* flashy.\n\nGrabbing the bag, he turned. \"Wait for me.\"\n\nYan Feifan waited. A short while later, Lu Ding walked out again, refreshing Yan Feifan's entire understanding of the word \"handsome.\" The wide sleeve displayed elegance, accentuated his bearing, and reflected inner substance, while the tight sleeve displayed martial prowess, depicted strength, and spoke of authority.\n\nPaired with Lu Ding's clothes-hanger-like physique...\n\nIt was absolutely perfect!\n\n\"Whoa, Brother Lu, did you just change your skin? From Classic to Legendary! They say clothes make the man, and you were already handsome to begin with. Now you're wearing something this cool... how is anyone else supposed to live?\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, I'll give you that, you've got a silver tongue. After the Ghost Festival is over, I'll treat you to hotpot.\"\n\nLu Ding was also very pleased, but he had one question. Where did Bai Hemian get two such exquisite outfits in just half a day?\n\n*A certain tailor somewhere: Where else? By exploiting me, of course! He just rattled off the measurements, said he needed it today, and not another word. I didn't dare ask questions, terrified he'd kill me. I just resent not being an ordinary person. Otherwise, how would you dare exploit me!!!?*\n\nTime to head out.\n\nTime to get to work!?\n\nOutside the Public Security Administration Bureau, two figures hid furtively within the leaves and branches of a landscaping banyan tree, more than ten meters off the ground.\n\nTheir eyes were glued to the Public Security Administration Bureau.\n\nWatching Lu Ding walk out of the main gate, dressed in his civil-military sleeves...\n\nThe two of them sneered in unison.\n\n\"'Show-off,'\" x2.\n\nJust that one word. But what did Lu Ding practice?\n\nThe Flying Bear Pouncing Kill Technique.\n\nThe technique of the overlord that dominated the north and south of the Two-Realm Mountains, and you're whispering about him behind his back?\n\nAn ordinary Spirit Sea realm practitioner's hearing might not have been so sharp, but these two had the bad luck to run into a Lu Ding whose cultivation had just advanced. You could say their luck had run out.\n\nA light breeze blew past.\n\n\"What were you saying? My hearing is very sharp. Don't talk bad about me behind my back.\"\n\nWhen Lu Ding's voice sounded, the two were so scared they nearly fell out of the tree.\n\nLooking at the man before them dressed in civil-military sleeves, alarm bells screamed in their heads. How is he so fast!?\n\nWeren't they saying his physical body was powerful, his talent exceptional, and his techniques profound? How is his speed this fast too!?\n\nBut no one ever said they'd seen him use such a fast movement technique!?\n\nWhat were they supposed to do? Can't beat him, can't outrun him.\n\nThe same thought flashed through both their minds: We screwed up.\n\n\"I... we were just pass—\"\n\nGuang Fei wanted to say they were just passing by, to make an excuse, but in the next second, his gaze uncontrollably drifted downward, until he saw his and Zhou Lie's headless bodies, gushing blood like fountains.\n\nSeeing Lu Ding's feet hovering, treading on the void, Guang Fei seemed to understand. It wasn't that his movement technique was fast—he was flying fast....\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Treasure Keeper (憋寶人):** A term for individuals who specialize in finding, identifying, and often hoarding valuable and mystical treasures.\n2.  **Civil-Military Sleeve Robe (文武袖):** A style of sleeve where one is wide and flowing (the \"civil\" sleeve, for scholarly elegance) and the other is tight-fitting (the \"military\" sleeve, for ease of combat).",

    "content": ".....\n\nIt took but a single encounter for the two of them to go from hassling Lu Ding to losing their heads.\n\nThey knew Lu Ding was decisive, but they hadn't expected him to be *this* decisive.\n\n\"Care to say you were just passing by?\"\n\n\"Skulking around in the middle of the night, Spiritual Qi flowing through you, passing by the Public Security Administration on the Ghost Festival—July 15th, no less—and deciding to hassle me. What a coincidence. Really, just too coincidental. Guess if I believe you?\"\n\nDid he even need to ask?\n\nIt was obvious they were here for him.\n\nAnd since they were here for him, why keep enemies around?\n\nBesides, Lu Ding only had a few enemies: the Tianli Cult, Great Black Mountain, and the second branch of the Cao family. The Cao family couldn't produce such powerful Qi Refiners right now, not with Cao Ying in charge.\n\nThe others wouldn't dare to act up.\n\nToday was the Ghost Festival, and Lu Ding had read the files on Great Black Mountain many times.\n\nOn festivals like this, things up there were lively. The old remnants who refused to come down had established villages and households, raising their descendants.\n\nIt was impossible they would send people of this caliber down to trouble him.\n\nThey weren't much stronger than Ye Feng, and even Ye Feng was killed in an instant; these two wouldn't have been able to cause him any real problems.\n\nFurthermore, there was another point: sending too few people would be useless, but sending too many... you couldn't possibly bring the entire village down, could you? If you didn't, and the strong ones left, who would protect those who remained? Wouldn't they all be ravaged by demons and monsters?\n\nAnd if you *did* bring them down—after refusing to descend in the first place—and now a whole village shows up? How could 749 possibly allow that, especially during the Ghost Festival? Wouldn't that be openly looking for trouble?\n\nTherefore, there was only one answer.\n\nThe words \"Tianli Cult\" surfaced in Lu Ding's mind.\n\nBelow, Yan Feifan caught the two falling heads and opened the 749 app on his phone to scan their faces.\n\n\"Brother Lu, these two are the Tianli Cult's 'Downwind Floater' Guang Fei and 'Ground-Hugging Tiger' Zhou Lie. They have criminal records and active bounties on them.\"\n\n\"Together, they're worth a hundred contribution points. It's a windfall, Brother Lu.\"\n\nYan Feifan's words confirmed the suspicion in Lu Ding's mind.\n\nHe floated down, stopping a few inches above the ground.\n\nLu Ding: \"'Downwind Floater'¹? He certainly was a fast delivery. And now the nickname finally fits the man.\"\n\nA \"floater,\" isn't that a corpse in the river? How can a living person be called that? It just wasn't right. Now that he's dead, it feels much more appropriate.\n\n\"How could these two be monitoring us at the Public Security Administration? Could they be plotting something?\"\n\nAs Yan Feifan said this, he looked at Lu Ding.\n\nUsually, he was the one doing the thinking, as Brother Lu couldn't be bothered to use his brain. But now the men were dead without revealing a single scrap of information.\n\nHe really couldn't make heads or tails of it.\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\nLu Ding asked out of the blue.\n\nYan Feifan glanced down and reported, \"Eleven o'clock, Brother Lu.\"\n\n\"Then let's drive over, there's still time. I'll explain on the way.\"\n\nFlying was an option, but that was for emergencies. Besides, dragging Yan Feifan along while flying always felt a bit off. Driving there would keep them from being separated, avoiding any... minor accidents when a major event like this was unfolding.\n\nHe'd seen it on TV before: two people could clearly go together, but they insist on splitting up, which leads to one of them getting picked off.\n\nLu Ding had to avoid that kind of situation.\n\nIn the car, Yan Feifan asked, \"Brother Lu, where are we driving to?\"\n\n\"To Cao Family Alley.\"\n\n\"These people are from the Tianli Cult. Their only conflict with me is over one thing: the Wind-Calming Pearl. Right now, the Wind-Calming Pearl is in Cao Ying's hands. He used it to retrieve the Ginseng People and Ginseng Horses from Wind-Facing Mountain.\"\n\n\"On his way back, he even clashed with the Tianli Cult.\"\n\n\"So the Tianli Cult knows he got the items, which means the Wind-Calming Pearl is of little use to them now.\"\n\n\"For them to still come after me, it's either because they can't swallow their pride and want revenge, or because Baofan District is my jurisdiction, and they want to stir up trouble here.\"\n\n\"They need to know my movements at a moment's notice, which is why they sent people to watch me.\"\n\n\"Stirring up trouble could mean luring out a monster, or it could mean robbing Cao Ying to get the Ginseng People and Ginseng Horses back. We don't know which one it is right now. So, we'll just change our starting point from the Public Security Administration to Cao Family Alley.\"\n\n\"It's also possible they plan to do both, and the probability is high. By luring out a monster, they draw me over, then they launch a sneak attack on Cao Family Alley, leaving me unable to be in two places at once.\"\n\nAs Lu Ding said this, a smile he couldn't suppress spread across his face. \"People these days... they've learned to use strategy. This is a truly unsolvable Yang Plot, once it begins.\"\n\n\"Once a monster appears, I definitely have to deal with it. If Cao Family Alley is attacked at that time, it's basically over.\"\n\n\"But it hasn't started yet, has it?\" Yan Feifan added, turning his head.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha.....\"\n\nLu Ding's laughter was wild.\n\nHe also found it interesting. Reality really was different from TV shows and novels. Novels were full of insidious schemes, but reality hits you with an open conspiracy—an unsolvable Yang Plot.\n\nThe kind you have to walk right into.\n\nBut that's only if the Yang Plot has already begun.\n\n\"That's right. The only way to break the scheme was just delivered to us. Truly a Downwind Floater, such a fast delivery. Same-day arrival.\"\n\nYan Feifan didn't understand the \"Shunfeng\" reference, but Lu Ding couldn't stop laughing.\n\nHe chuckled along beside him.\n\nHe thought to himself, *Of course. Brother Lu just usually can't be bothered to use his brain.*\n\n*Trying to lead Brother Lu away?*\n\n*The foolish Tianli Cult. Brother Lu saw through everything long ago.*\n\n*You thought Brother Lu wouldn't go, right?*\n\nYan Feifan could hardly wait to see the shocked faces of those people.\n\n*'How did Lu Ding get here!?'*\n\n*Surprise~! Here we come.*\n\nLu Ding's voice beside him cut through his fantasy.\n\n\"Send a message to the Five Viscera Shrine and the Four Seas Group. Tell them to secretly dispatch their people and watch every inch of Baofan District for me. If anything happens, they are to report to me immediately.\"\n\n\"Yes, Brother Lu.\"\n\nThis was something that could only happen in Lu Ding's Baofan District. In any other area, if you ordered the local top dogs around like this, they would be more than a little displeased.\n\nMaintaining order in the district is your 749's job. I don't get a salary from you, and I get no benefits, so on what grounds do you order me around? To work for you for free?\n\nBut in Baofan District, for these two top dogs—no, these three—it wasn't a question of whether they dared to refuse. The thought would never even cross their minds.\n\nCooperation.\n\nOne hundred percent cooperation.\n\nThe moment the message went out, the Five Viscera Shrine and the Four Seas Group sprang into action.\n\nIn the Five Viscera Shrine members' group chat:\n\n[Tang Bao/Group Owner: Brothers and sisters who are awake, wake up the ones who are asleep. Grab your gear, rouse the old spirits, and let the spirit soldiers out. Keep them in line and get ready to work.]\n\n[Patrol Officer Lu has given an order. He wants us to keep an eye on Baofan District and report to him immediately if anything happens. We handled the Broken Bridge Wharf incident very well last time.]\n\n[The logistics leaders at 749 said they are considering giving us an auxiliary status to assist 749 with cleanup work in Yunhai City. If we handle this well, we could become 749's people!]\n\nMessages scrolled rapidly below.\n\n[Jiang Zilin: Brother Bao, we can join 749? You're not joking, are you?]\n\n[Mao Chenghua: Our background checks probably wouldn't pass.]\n\n[Fang Yang: I have a prior offense. It wasn't major, but 749 is...]\n\nSeeing the members' doubts,\n\n[Tang Bao: That's why they're *considering*, not promising it immediately. It still depends on our performance. They're giving us this chance entirely on account of Patrol Officer Lu.]\n\n[Look across all of Yunhai City, which faction has been given auxiliary status by 749? None, not a single one. But we have this chance.]\n\n[Yan Honglang: Say no more, I'm heading out right now. I've wanted to join 749 for ages. Even without an official position, auxiliary is good enough.]\n\n[Gao Ji: If we can get auxiliary status, we can also redeem 749's resources and cultivation methods. And when we're operating under an official title, let's see who the hell dares to yell at me again?]\n\n[Liao Yao: I think we can do better. Brother Bao, we shouldn't trouble Patrol Officer Lu with minor issues. He's busy today. As auxiliary personnel, we should be easing the burden on official members like him. If we encounter a problem, we should handle it ourselves. Only report to Patrol Officer Lu for things we can't handle.]\n\nWhen Tang Bao saw this message, he shot to his feet. He had been too excited to think of that.\n\n[Tang Bao: You're a genius! That's what we'll do! Everyone, move, move, move! Those who need equipment, get it! Those who need to set up altars, set them up! Open the warehouse doors, let everyone take what they need!!!]\n\n***\n\n¹\"Shunfeng Piaozi\" (順風漂子). *Shunfeng* is the name of a major express delivery company in China (SF Express).

    "content": "...\n\nThe atmosphere in the Five Viscera Association was fired up and they were moving fast, but the Four Seas Group wasn't slow either.\n\nAlthough the Four Seas Group was a legitimate company and couldn't compare to the wild bunch from the Five Viscera Association, their enthusiasm wasn't low either.\n\nAs soon as they saw the message from Yan Feifan, they immediately began to rally their forces.\n\nThe round moon hanging high in the sky had a fuzzy halo.\n\nAs the great bell of the clock tower in Bao Fan District rang in the twelve o'clock hour...\n\nFeixiang Road, the northernmost part of Bao Fan District.\n\nTwo sneaky figures walked into the depths of an alley, setting something up.\n\nLittle did they know, a pair of beady little eyes was watching their every move from behind.\n\n\"This stuff is really potent, huh? How much should we use?\"\n\n\"You do the math. Ten grams can attract things from five kilometers around. We have fifty grams here, so that's twenty-five kilometers.\"\n\n\"It's the Ghost Festival today, so the density of demons and monsters is high. No matter how much we use, the effect will be terrifying. It'll definitely run Lu Ding ragged and keep him too busy to deal with Cao Family Alley.\"\n\nThe other person spoke up: \"Then let's not make it too big. We don't want too many people to die; it'll be a mess to clean up.\"\n\n\"The people from 749 will probably hunt us to the death. Let's just make a point. We're not trying to get revenge on society.\"\n\nAs the two were talking...\n\nAfter Little Gray Spirit relayed the message, it immediately lunged forward, becoming a blur as it snatched the small, transparent glass vial from their hands and fled.\n\n\"Hey!! Dammit, where did this little rat spirit come from? Catch it, catch it, don't let it get away!\"\n\n\"Damn, rats can burrow! It went into the wall.\"\n\n\"Then smash the wall.\"\n\nIn the Five Viscera Association members' group chat.\n\nAfter Tang Bao received the news, he immediately mobilized everyone in the chat, sending them to swarm Feixiang Road.\n\nThis was one of the founding principles of his Five Viscera Association: to overwhelm the few with the many.\n\nOne-on-one might be tough, but what about ten-on-one, or even a hundred-on-one?\n\nYou think you're Lu Ding, that you can be that ridiculously strong?\n\n[Tang Bao/Group Admin: Anyone who dares cause trouble in Bao Fan District, if you catch them, beat them to death.]\n\nThe group members chimed in below.\n\n[Damn, they're really looking down on us. We're at least auxiliary members of 749. A mouse touching a cat's ass—that's a rat¹ purely looking for death.]\n\n[Trying to lure monsters, harm ordinary people, and plot against Brother Lu? Who gave them the nerve? I'll kill 'em. I'm almost there, where are you guys? I can't wait anymore.]\n\n[Merit! I want to earn merit, great merit! If we catch these two, we'll have prevented a disaster! Auxiliary member of 749, here I fucking come!!]\n\nNews and progress from this end were slow to be sent back.\n\nLiu Xingchuan's brow furrowed. \"Something must have happened.\"\n\n\"How are things with Guang Fei and Zhou Lie?\"\n\nCaution. One must be cautious. Caution is the key to great success. As long as the green mountains are there, one need not worry about firewood.² This wasn't the Heavenly Principle Cult's home turf, after all.\n\nHis subordinate replied, \"I'll ask right away.\"\n\n[Guang Fei, what's the situation on your end? Is Lu Ding still there?]\n\n[He is. We're on it, everything's stable. The two of us are watching him.]\n\nThe man looked at the message on his phone. \"Don't worry, Helmsman. Lu Ding hasn't moved. He's still at the Public Security Bureau.\"\n\nHearing that Lu Ding was still at the Public Security Bureau, Liu Xingchuan relaxed.\n\nAs long as Lu Ding didn't run around, then everything was fine. Caution? What caution? Dammit, fortune favors the bold! He was just taking back his own things, why the hell did he need to be cautious?\n\n\"Charge in! Capture Cao Ying alive! Kill anyone you see! Tonight, I want Cao Family Alley wiped out, not even a chicken or dog left alive! Anyone who dares to steal my things must pay the price!!\"\n\n...\n\nThe Cao family mansion.\n\nLu Ding was sitting on a recliner, while next to him, the Old Master of the Cao family sat on a small stool, brewing tea.\n\nOf course, this wasn't at Lu Ding's request; the old man had insisted.\n\n\"Come, Patrol Officer Lu, please critique my tea. It's pre-Qingming.\"\n\nLu Ding took a sip. The fragrance lingered on his lips and teeth. He raised an eyebrow and set the cup down. \"The flavor is indeed excellent.\"\n\n\"Then would you like to take two pounds³ home with you?\"\n\nTwo pounds...\n\nHearing this, Yan Feifan's facial muscles twitched. This old man was really willing to spare no expense.\n\n\"Brother Lu, just as you predicted, they sent a message. I told them you were still at the Public Security Bureau,\" Yan Feifan said, holding up his phone.\n\nModern people, of course, communicate by phone.\n\nCao Ying watched from the side as Yan Feifan replied, feeling relieved in his heart.\n\nIt was a good thing he'd made the wise choice to give the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse to Patrol Officer Lu. Otherwise, wouldn't this audacious Heavenly Principle Cult have torn Cao Family Alley apart?\n\nBefore, he didn't care because Cao Family Alley wasn't his to manage. Now, Cao Family Alley was his. This was his property!!\n\nHis gaze drifted inadvertently to his own Old Master.\n\nCao Ying really wanted to ask, \"Great-Grandfather, the... lid⁴... did you eat it? How about you give it back to me?\"\n\nAt that moment, Lu Ding also stood up. \"Let's go. It's about time. We'll wait for them in the first courtyard.\"\n\n...\n\nCao family mansion, the first courtyard.\n\nDozens of people stormed the residence. Most flew in over the rooftops, but Liu Xingchuan, the Helmsman, strode arrogantly through the wide-open, vermilion gates.\n\nHis voice arrived before he did.\n\n\"Cao Ying!!! Master Cao!! Where are you? I, Liu Xingchuan, have come to find you! I've missed you so much these past few days. You truly are a great man.\"\n\n\"Spending your own money to handle my affairs, helping me buy back the Wind-Settling Pearl from Lu Ding, and then going to all the trouble of retrieving the Ginseng Man and Ginseng Horse from Mount Dingfeng for me. You really are a great man...\"\n\nAt this point, Liu Xingchuan raised a hand to rub his chin, his voice thick with suppressed laughter. \"To repay your great kindness...\"\n\n\"I've decided...\"\n\n\"to leave not a single chicken or dog alive in your Cao Family Alley!!!!!\"\n\n\"Men...\"\n\nAs Liu Xingchuan stepped over the threshold, before the word \"kill\" could leave his lips, the vermilion gates behind him shattered instantly. Lu Ding burst out from behind the door.\n\n\"I'll teach you to put on an act!!\"\n\nLeading with his palm, infused with spiritual qi and backed by the savage power of his physical body, he smashed the red door as if it were tofu, finally printing his hand on Liu Xingchuan's back.\n\nThere was a dull 'THUD!'\n\nThe Helmsman of the Heavenly Principle Cult, Liu Xingchuan, a Divine Palace realm expert, was sent flying forward, crashing through a rockery and tumbling into a koi pond in a pathetic state.\n\nBecause he had taken Lu Ding's palm to his back, a section of his chest now bulged outward. He vomited blood mixed with organ fragments, dyeing the pond water red.\n\nHe struggled to his feet, grievously injured. Unwillingness, confusion, doubt, and rage mingled in his eyes.\n\nHe watched Lu Ding, who had emerged from behind the door, now cutting down his subordinates with a flurry of strikes, dicing and dismembering them.\n\nHow could he be here!? Wasn't... wasn't he at the Public Security Bureau?\n\nHe roared, \"Lu Ding!!! Have you no shame? To resort to a sneak attack like this!!\"\n\nOnly then did he belatedly realize his miscalculation!\n\nSuch a meticulous plan, yet Lu Ding had somehow detected it, and even laid an ambush for him.\n\nHow could he be so shameless? After making such a huge name for himself as the Corpse-Solving Grand Marshal,⁵ he still pulls a stunt like a sneak attack!!!!\n\n***\n\n> ¹A pun. The idiom `當耗子摸貓屁股` (to be a mouse touching a cat's butt) means to court death. The follow-up line, `純鼠找死` (purely rat seeking death), plays on the fact that `鼠` (shǔ, rat) sounds like `屬` (shǔ, to be/belong to), making it a wordplay on the phrase `純屬找死` (purely seeking death).\n>\n> ²A Chinese proverb: `留得青山在不怕沒柴燒`. It means \"Where there's life, there's hope.\"\n>\n> ³The original text uses `兩斤` (liǎng jīn), two *jin* or *catties*. This is a significant amount (1 kg or ~2.2 lbs), especially for high-grade pre-Qingming tea, highlighting the old master's extravagance.\n>\n> ⁴This is a callback to a previous event, implying the Old Master consumed a valuable part of the Ginseng treasure, which Cao Ying now wants back.\n>\n> ⁵`解屍太歲` (Jiě Shī Tàisuì). `解屍` means to dissect or analyze a corpse. `太歲` (Tàisuì) is a powerful deity in Chinese folklore, often translated as the Grand Duke of Jupiter, symbolizing something formidable and not to be trifled with. \"Corpse-Solving Grand Marshal\" captures the intimidating nature of the title.",

    "content": "......\n\nLu Ding looked at the soaking wet Liu Xingchuan in the pool, who had clearly lost his composure.\n\n\"A sneak attack? I'm a Spirit Sea Realm cultivator fighting a Divine Palace Realm one. What's wrong with a sneak attack? I *did* sneak attack you, what are you gonna do about it!?\"\n\nA Spirit Sea fighting a Divine Palace would be a fool not to use a sneak attack. Although Lu Ding was confident he could beat him straight-up, a sneak attack saved a lot of trouble. Was he supposed to set up a ring, go over the rules, and forbid hitting below the belt, using legs, or striking the back of the head?\n\nWhat do you think this is, a boxing match?\n\n\"Are you going to condemn me from some moral high ground?\"\n\nThe taunting was maxed out.\n\nA fiend from an evil cult was going to condemn him?\n\nLu Ding just found it laughable.\n\nJust then, Cao Ying walked out of the room, followed by the Cao family's Old Master. Each of them was carrying two fiends from the Heavenly Principle Cult.\n\n\"You really think you're hot shit, huh? You really overplayed your hand this time, you bastard Liu. Daring to openly try and rob me right in front of Inspector Lu—you're completely out of control!!\"\n\n\"Thinking you're some big shot, why don't you wear a trench coat? Everyone else flies over the rooftops, but you just had to use the main gate. If we don't sneak attack you, who would we? Your eyes don't work, and neither does your brain.\"\n\nYan Feifan chimed in.\n\nThe two of them went back and forth, making Liu Xingchuan so angry his wounds hurt even more.\n\nThose two's mouths probably couldn't pass a high-speed rail security check; they'd be classified as controlled weapons. You'd probably poison yourself just by licking them.\n\nAnd yet, every word they said was on point.\n\nLiu Xingchuan's face turned red with anger. \"Lu Ding, you are a disgrace to the investigators of 749! I thought you were a righteous person, but I never expected you to stoop to such a despicable act!\"\n\nBut Lu Ding's next words made him so furious he coughed up another mouthful of blood.\n\n\"I'm an intern.\"\n\n*Pfft!!*\n\nA mouthful of blood sprayed out. It was that tone, that expression!!!!\n\n\"I fucking know you're an intern, you don't have to emphasize it!\"\n\nAs soon as those words were out, Yan Feifan instinctively ran toward a safer spot.\n\nCao Ying was a bit confused. \"Where are you running off to?\"\n\n\"Just stay put and don't move.\"\n\nAs Yan Feifan's voice fell, a surging aura instantly erupted, knocking everyone nearby off balance, making them stagger and unable to even stand firm.\n\nA ferocious beast's head materialized behind Lu Ding.\n\n\"For insulting a public official of 749, your crimes are now even greater!!\"\n\nChanneling qi with both hands, Lu Ding pushed his speed to the absolute limit. He crossed the dozens of meters in an instant, as if he had suddenly materialized right in front of Liu Xingchuan.\n\nHe thrust his palms forward. From the surging darkness behind him, a ferocious beast's head shot out, letting loose a soul-shaking roar.\n\nThe wind whistled through the gaps between Lu Ding's fingers, leaving white trails in its wake—a visual testament to the sheer power of his physical body!!!\n\nLiu Xingchuan's reaction was a fraction too slow. He immediately channeled qi to block, but a dull ache flared up again from the spot near his heart on his back, hindering his qi circulation and slowing him by a beat.\n\nA miss is as good as a mile.\n\nBOOM!!!!\n\nHe was sent flying backward, spinning through the air like a speeding car before crashing hard enough to demolish a wall.\n\n\"You moody bastard!!!\"\n\nHis internal injuries worsening, Liu Xingchuan now wanted nothing more than to curse Lu Ding and his eighteen generations of ancestors.\n\nHe attacked whenever he felt like it, without any warning whatsoever.\n\nAre you even human!?\n\nHe had no regard for the rules of the martial world. It was either a sneak attack or a sudden, explosive assault, and on top of all that, he was ridiculously strong.\n\nWas that really necessary?\n\nLiu Xingchuan had truly lost it.\n\nJust as he pushed aside the brick rubble and cursed, Lu Ding was already on him again, giving him no chance to breathe.\n\n\"You curse at me and you don't allow me to get angry? Lie down.\"\n\nAnother kick, accompanied by the 'peng' of a sonic boom, came at him. Having learned his lesson, Liu Xingchuan channeled qi into a shield in front of himself.\n\nBut it was still useless.\n\nBefore the speed and power of Lu Ding's leg, the seemingly sturdy shield was as brittle as ice on a southern river in January—pathetically thin.\n\nThis kick was heavier than being struck by a steel whip.\n\n\"Urk!!\"\n\nA mixture of fresh blood and vomit spewed from Liu Xingchuan's mouth.\n\n\"Enough!!!\"\n\nHe stabilized his stance and roared. Behind him, the phantom of a deity began to rise, holding a mourning staff, its form over ten meters tall and radiating a ghastly aura.\n\n\"This is my home turf!!!\"\n\n\"Roar at your mom.\"\n\nLu Ding raised his hand, forming a claw as he pressed down. Blood-colored energy gathered in the sky; the heavens had already changed when these people first arrived.\n\nThey just hadn't noticed.\n\nWithin the seemingly normal dark clouds, drops of blood rain sensed Lu Ding's call, instantly coalescing and forming a giant, blood-red palm that slammed down from above.\n\nThe ten-meter-plus phantom of the deity was instantly shattered.\n\nThe scattered blood rain corroded Liu Xingchuan's body, and chunks of his flesh slid off like wet mud.\n\n\"Ahhhh!!!!\"\n\nHearing his screams and seeing this, the other members of the Heavenly Principle Cult saw that Liu Xingchuan's defeat was imminent and immediately tried to flee. But one took a step, and a spear coalesced from a bloody puddle on the ground, running him straight through.\n\nHe was skewered and lifted into the air like a tanghulu.¹\n\n\"Come on, be my guest. Thinking of running now? Too late.\"\n\nLu Ding raised a hand and formed a seal.\n\nThe scattered blood rain on the ground immediately erupted, and a forest of sharp spikes shot up from the ground, instantly killing most of the Heavenly Principle Cult members.\n\nBut some managed to leap into the air and dodge.\n\n\"Split up and run!!!!\"\n\nWith that shout, the Heavenly Principle Cult members who had survived the ordeal immediately scattered and ran.\n\nAs for fighting Lu Ding?\n\nSorry, they weren't that stupid. He'd just insta-killed so many people with one move; what was the point in fighting him? If you were looking to die, then sure, you'd definitely come to the right guy.\n\nLittle did they know that by leaping into the air to escape, they were falling right into Lu Ding's trap.\n\nA flurry of slashes erupted.\n\nThe art of live dismemberment, displayed in mid-air.\n\nBehind him.\n\nThe heavily injured Liu Xingchuan had, at some point, removed the eyepatch he always wore.\n\nWhere an eye should have been, there was now a mouth full of sharp, jagged teeth.\n\nIt was speaking human words: \"My turn.\"\n\n\"Life Soul Coffins, Hundred Coffin Soul Lock!\"\n\nLiu Xingchuan quickly formed a series of hand seals. One after another, coffins pasted with purple talismans materialized out of thin air and plummeted down, their open mouths aimed straight at Lu Ding.\n\nHis figure flickered continuously as he dodged.\n\nHe kicked away one of the falling coffins. \"Now *this* is the kind of technique a Divine Palace Realm expert should have. Finally, something worth watching.\"\n\nThe hand seals Liu Xingchuan was making changed, and the grotesque mouth in his eye socket spoke again: \"Worth watching? Kid, you're really arrogant. In that case, let's add a little something extra.\"\n\n\"Life-Hating Coffin, the Footless Woman!\"\n\nA red coffin rose from the ground. With a creaking sound, a grayish-white hand with jade-green fingernails emerged from the edge of the lid.\n\nBut before it could fully extend...\n\nLu Ding's figure flickered, appearing in front of the coffin. He kicked it, directly interrupting the casting.\n\nTrying to play a summoning animation in front of him? Isn't that just asking for death?\n\nThe coffin, which had just opened a crack, was kicked shut with a loud *thump* before shattering and dissipating, a testament to the sheer power of that kick.\n\n\"If it's just something manifested by a technique and not a real monster, there's no need to show it to me.\"\n\n*That damn Lu Ding*, Liu Xingchuan cursed inwardly. *Relying on his formidable physical strength, he's completely unreasonable. He won't even let me finish a move.*\n\nAs Liu Xingchuan cursed, the blood rain pooled on the ground instantly shot out hundreds of red threads, flying toward him.\n\nHe was already prepared for this move. After all, a large number of the other Heavenly Principle Cult members had just been instantly killed by this very same, unknown technique.\n\n***\n\n¹A Chinese snack of candied fruit skewered on a long stick.",

What kind of monster is this!?*\n\nLu Ding’s physical body was too strong, his speed too fast, and with the harassment from those blood threads, Liu Xingchuan simply had no time to form hand seals and cast his spells before his qi circulation was disrupted.\n\n*I have to create some distance!!*\n\nThinking this, Liu Xingchuan looked toward Lu Ding's previous position.\n\nBut one look left him dumbfounded.\n\nWhere was he!?\n\nThe spot was completely empty.\n\nThe next second, a black shadow flickered beside him. He caught it in his peripheral vision, his eyes not even having time to focus.\n\nLu Ding was already in front of him, clenching his hand into a fist. As he did, tiny armor scales wrapped around his arm from his fingertips, gradually spreading across his entire body.\n\nGeneral's Adherent Armor!!!\n\nA comprehensive boost in power.\n\nHe threw a punch, a white band of air wrapping around his arm. BOOM!!!!\n\nAs Lu Ding's fist connected, two ring-shaped shockwaves, one large and one small, one after the other, blasted outwards through the air. His strength was already immense, and that was before adding the amplification from his speed and explosive force, and finally, the boost from the General's Adherent Armor technique.\n\nThis one punch.\n\nIt shattered Liu Xingchuan's entire head. The headless corpse was sent flying by the force, crashing into a courtyard and carving out a large crater.\n\nThe bizarre, mouthed eyeball landed beside the headless corpse.\n\nWatching Lu Ding float over, it asked weakly, \"Quite a man, Lu Ding. Quite the Corpse-Dissolving Grand Duke.¹ Is this your full strength? A fifth-level Spirit Sea defeating a Divine Palace...\"\n\nFull strength?\n\nLu Ding wouldn't dare unleash his full strength here. His full strength would have to include a fully activated Blood Rain and Foul Wind technique.\n\nAt maximum power, it wouldn't be about pulling people into the technique's space or accumulating blood rain in the sky for his use. Instead, blood rain would fall directly from the heavens, and a foul wind would ravage everything.\n\nAt that point, all the people and buildings in this area would probably be destroyed. All life would be extinguished, and it would become a land of death.\n\nThis was a residential area; Lu Ding wouldn't mess around like that.\n\nAs for a Spirit Sea *defeating* a Divine Palace?\n\nNo, it's a Spirit Sea *killing* a Divine Palace!!\n\n\"You want to live? If that's really possible, try reincarnating.\"\n\nThe mouthed eyeball panicked.\n\nSeeing Lu Ding raise his foot, it hurriedly shouted:\n\n\"Don't, don't kill me! I know a lot of things! I can report them to 749! If you take me back, you can take me back for merit, for a promotion and a raise!\"\n\n\"Aren't you a probationary investigator now? Capture me and you'll become a full-fledged investigator immediately, maybe even get a high rank!\"\n\n\"Contribution points, yes, contribution points! Capture me, capture me! Taking me back will get you...\"\n\nSplat.\n\nThe eyeball burst under Lu Ding's foot, its noisy voice disappearing along with its residual spiritual qi.\n\nBefore death, Liu Xingchuan had one last thought.\n\n*What a capricious bastard who doesn't even let people finish their sentences!!!!*\n\n\"Just die already. Why so much damn talking.\"\n\nLu Ding had been listening to his incessant chirping since before the fight even started. If he hadn't thought the guy might pull out a surprise, he would've killed him long ago.\n\nTurns out, trash is just trash. All his stuff was just manifestations from techniques, fucking useless.\n\nAs for the intelligence, secrets, and promotion he mentioned, Lu Ding didn't want to hear it. He wasn't interested. If he'd wanted a promotion, he would've gotten one long ago; all he had to do was leave a few monsters alive.\n\nOld Master Cao watched, a cold sweat pouring down his back.\n\nHe was thankful for his wise decision.\n\nThank goodness, thank goodness he hadn't come out back then.\n\nOtherwise, he could already imagine his own end.\n\nIf he had come out, he definitely wouldn't have attacked directly. He would have certainly tried to say it was a misunderstanding, or that they should just drop it, or something about his own cultivation realm being high and Lu Ding's being low.\n\nAnd then Lu Ding would have definitely attacked, just like now, with his \"don't want to hear it, not interested\" attitude. Before he could even get the first word out, he would have been met with a continuous storm of attacks from Lu Ding.\n\nTerrifying speed, a terrifying physical body, bizarre techniques, imperceptible slashes—all used in varying combinations.\n\nIt would have beaten him so badly he wouldn't have had any strength to fight back.\n\nEven a Divine Palace realm expert couldn't injure him.\n\nHe himself...\n\n...probably wouldn't have survived all those moves...\n\n\"Brother Lu is Brother Lu, so fucking cool! Great-Grandpa, don't just stand there stunned! Hurry up and brew your good tea for Brother Lu. Brother Lu saved our Cao Family Lane!\"\n\nOld Master Cao: ...\n\nYou really are some grandson!!!\n\n*You get to say all the nice things, but I'm the one paying for it. I don't even get the good stuff, just the lid. At this rate, I think you're my great-grandpa.*\n\nSigh...\n\nHe let out a helpless sigh.\n\nA smile appeared on Old Master Cao's face. \"Brother Lu... Executive Lu.\"\n\nInstantly, all eyes turned to him.\n\nOld Master Cao was a bit embarrassed. It was a slip of the tongue, a blunder, mainly because the shock from Lu Ding's display was too overwhelming.\n\nOn top of that, Cao Ying and Yan Feifan's constant \"Brother Lu this, Brother Lu that\" was giving him a headache.\n\n\"Executive Lu, please have a seat. I'll go get a new tea set.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to Cao Ying. \"Niu Niu, hurry and send our family's men out to cooperate with Executive Lu's work and patrol the Baofan District.\"\n\n\"And have someone come in and clean this stuff up off the ground. It's hot out; if we don't deal with it quickly, it'll attract flies.\"\n\n\"Eh, eh, eh, I'll go right now! Brother Lu, enjoy your tea! I'll be right back.\"\n\nCao Ying turned and ran off.\n\nLu Ding scraped the sticky gunk off the bottom of his shoe on the edge of the steps and walked over.\n\n\"Old Master Cao,\" he said, \"I broke quite a few of your walls today. Tomorrow, please tally up the damages and give the list to Feifan. I'll approve the claim for you.\"\n\nOld Master Cao practically bent over from Lu Ding's respectful tone.\n\nWhen he encountered this old master during the Cao Yuan family incident, he was an enemy. There was no mercy, just a thought to \"kill the old bastard.\"\n\nBut today, here in Cao Family Lane, it was different. Although the old man's strength was no match for Lu Ding's, his age was a factor.\n\nLu Ding might be arrogant, but matters of politeness were a sign of good upbringing. Calling him \"Old Master Cao\" wasn't out of line.\n\n\"I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare, Executive Lu. You came today for the sake of Cao Family Lane. Without you, it's uncertain if Cao Family Lane would even exist after tonight. Please don't say such things; this old man can't bear it.\"\n\nThe old master was truly trembling as he listened.\n\nHe had nearly died at Lu Ding's hands because of a single fleeting thought before. He didn't dare accept the offer. The young man's respectful address was a testament to his good character and respect for the elderly.\n\nAs for the broken walls, forget the walls; even if Lu Ding had smashed people to bits, he wouldn't have said a word.\n\nThis was a life-saving grace.\n\nThis Executive Lu was truly... truly... he couldn't quite put it into words.\n\nThe old master turned to go brew the tea.\n\nYan Feifan walked up, his expression somewhat serious. \"Brother Lu, just now, while you were fighting the one-eyed man, Xie Shunan from the Four Seas Group sent a message.\"\n\n\"Netherworld pallbearers passed through, carrying a coffin. They started from the Yuanfeng Crematorium and crossed through our Baofan District. Although they didn't cause any trouble, they took a lot of demons and monsters with them.\"\n\n\"They took the demons and monsters away!?\"\n\nLu Ding's voice rose slightly.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Corpse-Dissolving Grand Duke (解屍太歲, Jiě Shī Tàisuì):** A title.

Did Xie Shunan's side say anything?\"\n\n\"She didn't say that. She originally sent people to follow for a bit, but Brother Lu, you know how Yin Person Borrowing Road works—it flickers and flashes, not fast, but more outrageous than flying, so they don't know where it went.\"\n\nAfter hearing Yan Feifan's words, Lu Ding fell into thought.\n\nThis matter of Yin Person Borrowing Road isn't huge, nor is it small; it depends on how it develops.\n\nTo put it lightly, it's just borrowing a path—Yin people borrow the road, Yang people avoid it, taking another look at the world's scenery to resolve their obsessions.\n\nBut to put it seriously, this is the origin of the Hundred Ghosts Night Parade.\n\nNow that the demons and monsters from Baofan District have been taken, it seems the chances of a Hundred Ghosts Night Parade are high.\n\nA rare flicker of excitement appeared in Lu Ding's eyes.\n\n\"Has it been reported?\"\n\n\"It's already been reported, Brother Lu. Should we report what happened here?\"\n\n\"Report this matter too for now, but don't request after-action personnel. Caojia Alley will handle it themselves.\"\n\nIt's going to be busy tonight, so save what can be saved. Anyway, it's not a rigid necessity on his end.\n\nAnd here they are.\n\nCao Ying returned with the cleanup crew.\n\nYan Feifan thought for a moment beside him, then said, \"Brother Lu, I think this looks like a Hundred Ghosts Night Parade. Will there be a group battle tonight?\"\n\nGroup battle.\n\nIt's been a long time since I heard that term.\n\nBut you have to admit, as soon as that word came out, it instantly stirred up people's desire to fight.\n\nHundred Ghosts Night Parade vs. Yunhai 749—isn't that exactly a group battle?\n\nIf these things are allowed to roam around in groups, ordinary people will be finished.\n\nWhether it's people or these demons and monsters, they all avoid gathering in crowds, because once they coalesce, someone will always go \"Eh?\"\n\nAnd then it's \"I have an idea.\"\n\nI don't understand.\n\nOften at times like these, he himself didn't dare to imagine how bold he was.\n\n\"Have some tea, Executive Lu.\"\n\nOld Master Cao walked out with a new tea set.\n\nHe demonstrated his tea art technique nearby.\n\nWashing cups, placing tea, brewing tea, skimming foam... all in one fluid motion, with tea fragrance filling the air.\n\nLu Ding picked up a cup and sipped it carefully: \"Then let's wait and see. Anyway, nothing's happening in our Baofan District for now. If there's a group battle, we'll go anytime. If not...\"\n\nLu Ding left the rest unsaid.\n\nYou know, Tang Bao's side had confiscated Raw Rhino Powder.\n\nThis thing is rare, truly difficult to obtain, but as for being a treasure, it only has one use: attracting ghosts and monsters. However, the stronger one's power, the more resistance they have to it.\n\nLu Ding had originally thought of using it to gather a wave of monsters and farm rewards.\n\nNow that the demons and monsters have all been swept away by Yin Person Borrowing Road, anything attracted by Raw Rhino Powder would at most be ordinary stuff.\n\nNot very useful.\n\nTomorrow, if there's no group battle today, then Lu Ding will find a place to scatter Raw Rhino Powder tomorrow and play by himself.\n\nIf there's a group battle today, then this Raw Rhino Powder will be temporarily useless.\n\nAfter one group battle, it's estimated that all the powerful demons and monsters will be cleared out.\n\nOr, Yunhai 749 is finished, but that possibility is almost nonexistent.\n\nSo, what he needs to do now is wait!\n\nWait for a signal for a group battle.\n\n.....\n\nTwo in the morning.\n\nThe procession of Yin people carrying coffins to borrow a path grew larger and larger, starting from Yuanfeng Crematorium in Wenqiu District, passing through Anhong District, Baofan District, Taisi District, and now traversing Fengyang District.\n\nBehind this procession.\n\nHundreds of figures followed, with Shen Gong and Siming Realm experts mixed in. It was surveillance, tailing, and also a threat.\n\nMonitoring every move of your Yin Person Borrowing Road, threatening to kill you if you dare to pull any tricks during the Hundred Ghosts Night Parade!\n\nWithin the group.\n\nSomeone cursed.\n\n\"Damn it, it got this big before being discovered. What were the executives in Wenqiu District and Anhong District doing? They only got reported after sweeping up monsters from two districts and passing through Baofan District.\"\n\n\"If it had been discovered earlier, it could have been nipped in the bud, and we wouldn't have to worry about the safety of ordinary people and hesitate to act like this.\"\n\nIf it had been discovered earlier and intercepted earlier, Yin Person Borrowing Road would just be Yin Person Borrowing Road—carrying a coffin doesn't add much.\n\nIt could be easily nipped in the bud.\n\nBut it just so happened to develop across several large districts, sweeping along a host of demons and monsters. In such a situation, if you were to act rashly, the demons and monsters would scatter.\n\nAll the ordinary people nearby would suffer.\n\nMoreover, fighting so many demons and monsters in a busy commercial district would cause immeasurable destruction.\n\nThe risk was too great to bear.\n\nSo after Lu Ding's side reported it, the higher-ups sent people to keep a distant watch.\n\nIf these demons and monsters didn't infringe on the interests of ordinary people, and were just enjoying a Hundred Ghosts Night Parade, then they would simply pass.\n\nThe safety of ordinary people must be ensured.\n\nBut if these things attacked ordinary people, then they would immediately follow suit, minimizing the risk.\n\nAlthough this approach also had problems, there was no choice. By the time the monster procession passed Baofan District and entered Taisi District, it was already very large.\n\nBy the time Yunhai 749's main force arrived, the procession had already nearly finished passing through Taisi District.\n\nAnd it had swept up all the ghostly things from Taisi District.\n\nOnce you act on the spot, people from other districts are people, but aren't the people from Taisi District also people?\n\nSo, they could only wait and see, thinking that since these ghostly things had been so well-behaved all along, perhaps once they passed Fengyang and the last New District, they would leave Yunhai.\n\nWithin the procession, someone responded to the previous man's words.\n\n\"You also need to consider what kind of executives those in Wenqiu and Anhong Districts are.\"\n\n\"Then look at who the executive of Baofan District is—that's Lu Ding, this year's toughest newcomer. Can they be compared? It was unexpected that the executives of other districts couldn't discover it, but it's also understandable.\"\n\n\"That's true, Lu Ding is indeed quite fierce. I was just complaining casually. It could have been dealt with decisively, but now we can only threaten. I'm just annoyed.\"\n\n\"Hey, alright, stop being annoyed. These ghostly things have stopped.\"\n\nAhead.\n\nAt Luo Ping'an's construction site.\n\nThe Hundred Ghosts Night Parade procession stopped here.\n\nThe coffin being carried immediately burst open.\n\nA man in a black robe flew out from it. With a raise of his hand, the concrete foundation before him shattered with a roar.\n\nSoil churned, and the black-robed man flew down from the air, cupping bloody soil in his hands, feeling the aura upon it.\n\nHis expression was ferocious, and waves of terrifying aura spread out.\n\nImages from the past appeared before his eyes.\n\nAtop a high mountain, two boulders, one large and one small, were battered by wind and rain. The smaller one was the Nanshan Boulder, the legendary Heaven-Mending Seed, while the larger one was just an ordinary rock.\n\nLater, a group of villagers climbed the high mountain, knelt and bowed to the larger rock, offered incense and livestock, then wrapped it in red cloth and carried it down to the foot of the mountain by human effort.\n\nThey invited the best stonemasons, chose the most auspicious time and day, and carved the three characters \"Shigandang\"!",

    "content": "...It was later placed at the village entrance.\n\nTo guard the peace of the area.\n\nTime flew by, the years like a shuttle. And so, while enjoying the incense offerings and guarding the village, the Shigandang gradually developed a sliver of consciousness.\n\nIn his naivety, he came to see the stone that had accompanied him through countless years on the mountaintop as his own dear brother.\n\nHe understood that his 'brother' might have an extraordinary origin, so he had been waiting all this time for the day the Nanshan Stubborn Stone would emerge and take form.\n\nSeveral hundred years ago, war broke out everywhere. The smoke of battle filled the air, and demons and monsters ran rampant.\n\nIt, too, was taken by passing soldiers to be used in repairing fortifications.\n\nBecause the distance was too great, it never again sensed the aura of the Nanshan Stubborn Stone.\n\nLater, after he had drunk his fill of battlefield blood and absorbed the baleful, resentful energy, gaining the ability to take form and emerge into the world, he returned to find the Nanshan Stubborn Stone.\n\nBy then, the Nanshan Stubborn Stone had already developed its own consciousness.\n\nIt told the man.\n\nThat it had to pass its human tribulation¹ without intentional interference from others before it could emerge.\n\nIn a little over a hundred years, it would be dug up at this spot in Fengyang District. But in all likelihood, nothing would go wrong; it only needed to wait for the Ghost Festival of that year, and it would be able to emerge.\n\nBut the man understood. A tribulation was a tribulation; how could anything be one hundred percent certain?\n\nBut there was nothing he could do. The human tribulation was something you had to pass. It was just like when he was moved to repair the fortifications; if a cannonball had landed and shattered him, that would have counted as failing his human tribulation.\n\nMoreover, you couldn't have help with a human tribulation. Not only would it not count, but the repercussions would be even more perilous—a nine-in-ten chance of death.\n\nSo, he could only leave the Nanshan Stubborn Stone where it was.\n\nAs for himself, he hid away at the Yuanfeng Funeral Home, continuing to be a Shigandang, exposed to the wind and sun, while also absorbing the funeral home's yin and baleful energy.\n\nBut the result!!!\n\nThe result!!!\n\nToday was clearly the day the Nanshan Stubborn Stone was to emerge, yet disaster struck!!!\n\nEverything was proceeding normally, but then the Nanshan Stubborn Stone just had to run into the variable that was Lu Ding.\n\nIf it weren't for Lu Ding, those workers might not have dared to touch it.\n\nAt the time, when Lu Ding made his move, the workers were trying to stop him, to persuade him. Even Luo Anping was hesitating.\n\nBut they were no match for Lu Ding's art of rhetoric and misdirection.\n\nAnd that's what led to the activation of his golden finger² and the Nanshan Stubborn Stone's failure to pass its tribulation.\n\nA rage that words could not describe surged from the man's heart.\n\n\"I want you all to be buried with my brother!!!!!\"\n\nRumble... The earth trembled as waves of terrifying aura spread out. Although the man's origin was just an ordinary stone, the words *Shigandang* had been carved on him for several hundred years.\n\nHe had also been empowered by the faith from incense offerings, as well as various fortunate coincidences.\n\nThough in the end, by drinking his fill of blood and absorbing resentful, baleful energy, he had strayed from the proper path.\n\nBut even so, he could still barely be called a god!!!\n\nThe originally orderly Hundred Ghosts Night Parade instantly descended into chaos.\n\nWithin the 749 team.\n\nThe Siming Realm powerhouse in the lead shouted.\n\n\"Sound the earthquake alarm, activate the network isolation, block the traffic, and have the cleanup crew move in to evacuate the surrounding populace.\"\n\n\"Also, send out an emergency message! Gather all currently unengaged investigators to converge here at once. We must purge these things from this area!!!!\"\n\n\"For now, try to contain them! Don't let them spread out and cause harm! Buy time for the civilian evacuation!!!\"\n\nAs the series of commands was issued.\n\nOver a hundred members of 749 charged toward the ranks of the Hundred Ghosts Night Parade.\n\n\"Fuck, we've been tailing you all this way, and now we can finally make a move!!!\"\n\n\"Be buried with you? Who the hell do you think you are? I'll bury you!!!\"\n\n\"Brothers, I'm going in,嗷! Keep an eye on me, don't let a monster sneak up on me!!!\"\n\n\"Pair up! Anyone who cultivates the physical body, team up with me!!!\"\n\n\"You motherf—, come and fight me!!!\"\n\nHowling, the members of 749 charged forward, even fiercer than the monsters.\n\nCursing up a storm³, they boosted their own morale.\n\nDecorum?\n\nNonexistent. When you're fighting demons and monsters, what damn decorum is there to speak of?\n\nThe rising and falling sounds of magical arts impacting and exploding were drowned out by the blare of the massive alarm.\n\nAt that moment, everyone in Fengyang District heard the mechanical female voice of the earthquake early warning.\n\n[Eighteen... *didi*... seventeen... *didi*... sixteen... *didi*... fifteen... *didi*...]\n\nAt this time, many ordinary people were still deep in their dreams.\n\nHearing this warning, they were jolted awake.\n\n\"Holy shit, wife, wake up! Two warnings!!!\"\n\n\"Dad, Mom, stop sleeping! An earthquake is coming!!!\"\n\n\"Quick, quick, grab our son! It's too late to run, let's hide in the bathroom!!\"\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nAt the 749 logistics and communications department.\n\nVoices rang out one after another.\n\n\"Report, high-impact seismic event early warning alarm has been sounded!\"\n\n\"Report, satellite link is active, video feed is returning normal!!\"\n\n\"Report, communications barrier is active. Current test data shows interception function is normal!!\"\n\n\"Report, road blockade directive has been successfully issued. All road sections within a ten-kilometer radius of the Haoyuan Phase II construction site are currently being sealed. Estimated time to completion: ten minutes!!\"\n\n\"Report, cleanup personnel have assembled and are en route to Fengyang District!!\"\n\n\"Report, incident coordination files have been sent!!\"\n\n\"Report, emergency directive has been issued, covering the entire Yunhai City area, precision-delivered to every 749 investigator!!!\"\n\nA woman stood with her arms crossed, watching the various data points and the incoming combat footage on the large screen.\n\n\"It's been years since we've had a scene this big. A wild god leading a Hundred Ghosts Night Parade, a god mixed in with demons and monsters, shouting about having people buried with him...\"\n\n\"A god should stay in a god's place. Demons and monsters should stay where demons and monsters belong.\"\n\n\"If you can't pass your human tribulation, who can you blame?\"\n\n\"This is your own calamity. Did you think you could only succeed and never fail? This is fate.\"\n\nAs the supervisor of the 749 communications department, she of course knew that Lu Ding was the one who had done in the Nanshan Stubborn Stone.\n\nBut so what?\n\nIt wouldn't have mattered if they knew beforehand; even if they had, the result would have been the same.\n\nIt's called a human tribulation. Is it really so surprising that it couldn't pass?\n\nBesides, trading a Nanshan Stubborn Stone for Lu Ding—a monstrous genius who not only possesses terrifying talent but is also dedicated to his job and has zero tolerance for demons and monsters?\n\nThat was more than worth it!!\n\nTo put it bluntly, it was all preordained.\n\nThe moment the emergency message went out, every idle 749 investigator in Yunhai began rushing toward Fengyang District.\n\nThis was the advantage of fighting on home turf.\n\nThe Hundred Ghosts Night Parade—it sounded like a great number.\n\nBut don't forget, this is Yunhai, the location of a 749 branch office!\n\nTrying to outnumber them in their own nest—isn't that just asking for death?\n\nMost 749 investigators, while not as concise and direct in their methods as Lu Ding, never subscribed to the idea of one-on-one duels when facing monsters and enemies.\n\nCharging in shoulder-to-shoulder was their general style.\n\nAt the same time.\n\nFar away in Baofan District, Lu Ding also heard the shrill sound of the earthquake alarm.\n\nYan Feifan stood up, holding his phone, and shouted, \"Brother Lu, a team fight's kicked off in Fengyang District!!!\"\n\n---\n¹ `人劫 (rén jié)`: A \"human tribulation\" or \"mortal calamity,\" a trial one must pass that involves interactions with or dangers from the mortal world.\n\n² `金手指 (jīn shǒuzhǐ)`: Literally \"golden finger,\" a common term in Chinese web novels for a protagonist's unique superpower, cheat ability, or system.\n\n³ `國粹 (guócuì)`: Literally \"national quintessence,\" used here as a humorous and sarcastic term for profanity.",

    "content": "...\n\n\"Our people are fighting the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons. It's happening at the Haoyuan Phase II construction site in Fengyang District—that's the main battlefield.\"\n\n\"All investigators who've received the message are to head over now.\"\n\nYan Feifan's face flushed with excitement.\n\nThis was a major event.\n\nBut Lu Ding had a strange expression on his face.\n\nThe Haoyuan Phase II construction site in Fengyang District... wasn't that where he had crushed the Stubborn Rock of Nanshan and unlocked his golden finger?\n\nWhy would a fight break out there?\n\nBut Lu Ding didn't have time to overthink it.\n\nSince everyone was heading over, it was going to be a case of too many wolves for too little meat.\n\nHe pictured several 749 investigators ganging up on a single demon, and he knew he had to hurry. If he was late, he wouldn't even get the scraps.\n\nWhether he could make a big haul today all depended on this trip!\n\nHe downed the tea in his cup in one gulp.\n\n\"Old Master Cao, keep an eye on Baofan District for me. I'm off.\"\n\nWith that, without even waiting for Cao Ying or Old Master Cao to reply, Lu Ding grabbed Yan Feifan by the collar and flew off.\n\nCompared to the other 749 investigators, his advantage was that he could fly!\n\nAs for bringing Yan Feifan along, it was because after a big event like this, rewards would likely be distributed based on merit. By bringing Yan Feifan, he could just let him go play on the side once they arrived.\n\nEvery little bit he could leech was something.\n\nIt was still contribution points, still some meat on the bone.\n\nBesides, Yan Feifan knew how to burrow through the earth; if he couldn't win a fight, couldn't he at least run away?\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nBai Hemian, who had accepted a reassignment, crushed the head of a monkey-like sprite with one hand as he listened to the blaring alarm.\n\nHe looked at the emergency alert that popped up on the 749 app on his phone.\n\n*Lu Ding should be going too, right?* he thought.\n\nFriends are meant to experience things together; that's how you deepen a friendship.\n\nFor example, combat!!!\n\nAt this thought, he paid no mind to the two investigators he was supposed to be backing up and dissolved into darkness, speeding away into the distance.\n\nOne flew suspended in the sky.\n\nThe other streaked across the ground as darkness.\n\nBoth were heading directly for Fengyang District, a point-to-point journey.\n\nAt this moment, on the Haoyuan Phase II construction site in Fengyang District.\n\nYin Feng swung a meteor hammer, but the half-woman, half-snake creature in front of him raised a hand to block, batting the hammerhead away.\n\nShe stretched out her other hand, which transformed into countless brightly-colored venomous snakes that slithered through the air toward him at incredible speed.\n\nYin Feng scrambled to dodge, with no time to form the hand seals for a spell.\n\nJust then, a man wearing a half-mask charged out from behind him.\n\nHe formed a hand seal, and a spell disc in his hand grew larger.\n\n\"Hundred-Killing Golden Arrows!!!\"\n\nA volley of golden arrows shot out from the disc, pinning the slithering venomous snakes.\n\nYin Feng got a clear look at the newcomer. \"Wen Rouchu?!\"\n\n\"You can recognize me even with the mask?\"\n\nWen Rouchu was a little puzzled. He'd been wearing this mask ever since Lu Ding had cut his face.\n\nThe reason, however, wasn't to hide scars as the rumors claimed; the wound on his face had long since healed without a trace.\n\nHe wore the mask as a constant reminder to himself to fix his bad habit of running his mouth.\n\nAfter all, before Lu Ding, no one had ever treated him like that.\n\nIt was after that incident with Lu Ding that he'd come to understand something: if he didn't learn to control his mouth, the next time he met a stranger, it could be the very thing that got him killed.\n\nAs for whether he resented Lu Ding.\n\nWen Rouchu would tell you: no, and he didn't dare to. What if Lu Ding found out and dragged him to a deathmatch platform?\n\nHe'd heard that Lu Ding could read people's eyes; someone had already gotten beaten up just for looking at him with resentment.\n\n\"Chatting during a battle isn't a very good habit. If you get distracted, won't you feel pain?\"\n\nA strange voice came from behind them.\n\nAs the word \"pain\" reached their ears, both Yin Feng and Wen Rouchu felt a sudden, inexplicable, heart-piercing agony surge through their bodies.\n\nThey both fell for the attack and collapsed to the ground.\n\nThey got a look at the spellcaster's true form: a male figure in green robes, floating above the ground. His face had four eyes, their pupils constantly shifting, creating a truly bizarre sight.\n\nHis methods were just as strange; for a moment, neither of them could discern the origin of this demon.\n\nThe pain in their bodies grew more and more intense.\n\nWen Rouchu wanted to smack himself in the face. Damn it, how was this stupid habit still affecting him? It really wasn't something he could fix overnight.\n\nIf he hadn't just responded to Yin Feng, maybe his attention wouldn't have been divided, and he wouldn't have fallen for this monster's trick.\n\nSeeing the two men's faces contorted in pain, the floating sprite spread his arms. \"Talking too much during a battle can get you distracted, you know.\"\n\nHearing this, Wen Rouchu only grew angrier.\n\n\"I... I don't get what you're gloating about. Aren't you running your mouth during a battle right now? I happen to know someone who doesn't waste time with bullshit in a fight.\"\n\n\"He's just not here right now. If he were, you'd find out that even saying one more word would be a luxury you couldn't afford.\"\n\n\"Oh? Is that so? Then I'd really like to meet him.\"\n\nAs the sprite spoke, the half-woman, half-snake creature beside him seemed to sense something.\n\n\"The aura of a Flying Centipede... why is there the aura of a Flying Centipede here!?\"\n\nShe instantly became alert, her eyes darting around, searching ceaselessly.\n\nThe woman's true form was a Beauty Snake—not one of those artificially matured by Ling Gu's secret arts, but a genuine, wild one that had attained enlightenment through cultivation.\n\nThe Flying Centipede was her natural enemy.\n\nBut after scanning the entire area, the woman still couldn't pinpoint the source of the Flying Centipede's aura.\n\nIt was as if it were diffused in the wind, everywhere at once.\n\nThe four-eyed sprite beside her commented casually, \"What Flying Centipede? Your kind is really paranoid about them. There's no one like that in our group this time.\"\n\nThe woman thought about it and agreed.\n\nIf there had been, she would have sensed it long before. She wouldn't have joined tonight's Night Parade of a Hundred Demons, not for anything.\n\n\"Alright, they've lost their will to fight. I'll leave them to you. I'm off to find some other fun.\"\n\nThe four-eyed sprite turned and floated away.\n\nBut the next moment, the four-eyed sprite's body froze in place.\n\nA hand clamped down securely on his four-eyed head.\n\nPale, slender fingers descended from above, pressing against his forehead.\n\nA chiseled, sculpture-like face peered over his shoulder.\n\nIt was clearly a human voice that rang in his ear, yet it sounded so terrifying.\n\n\"I heard you wanted to see me?\"\n\nThe four-eyed sprite's body was as if paralyzed by a binding spell, unable to move. It was only then that Lu Ding learned something new.\n\nApparently, monsters could also sweat bullets.\n\nFor an instant, his life flashed before his four eyes, his entire history flicking past.\n\nA moment later, he came back to his senses.\n\n*Am I going to die?*\n\n*I'm going to die.*\n\n\"I...\"\n\n*Crack.*\n\nWith a crisp snap, Lu Ding casually twisted off the four-eyed sprite's head.\n\n*So last words really are a luxury...*\n\nThat was its final thought before it died.\n\nA notification appeared before his eyes.\n\n【Monster Contained: Yanghua Corpse Ghost Sprite】\n\n【Containment Reward: Dark Death Coffin Technique】\n\n【Dark Death Coffin: Summons the six sides of a coffin, trapping the enemy within to perish in darkness.】\n\nThe Yanghua Corpse Ghost Sprite.\n\nAccording to the ancient scripture, *Inner Secret Texts of the Three Sovereigns and Eight Extremes*: A Yanghua Corpse Ghost Sprite takes the form of a man, dressed in white or green robes, with four eyes and no feet. It often roams quiet places at night, calling out like a human.\n\nIt speaks of suffering from pain, and if a person hears this and believes it to be a genuinely sick person, or if they ask a question and it responds, they will die instantly. This is the spirit of an ancient, buried coffin.\n\nTo put it bluntly, it was an old coffin sprite. It liked to wander around in the dead of night, crying out about pain and sickness. If you answered it, you died. If you even heard what it said, you were in for a world of hurt.\n\nNearby.\n\nThe Beauty Snake sprite was trembling like a leaf, her face deathly pale and drained of all color, terrified by the aura of the Wind-Fixing Technique that Lu Ding had brought with him.\n\nIt was the oppressive feeling of a natural enemy.\n\nBut the main reason was that this Wind-Fixing Technique was cast by Lu Ding—and it was at max level.",

    "content": "It's almost like you're terrified of cockroaches, and out of the corner of your eye, you glimpse a large, black-and-red cockroach \"flying\" past.\n\nBut you're not sure, thinking it's an illusion.\n\nThis corresponds to Lu Ding's aura as he flew in, shrouded in the Wind-Calming Art.\n\nThen you turn your head, and on the sofa sits a cockroach about your size.\n\nIt looks at you with a cold face and says: \"You, go fry two dishes for me. I've had too much raw and cold food these past two days, it's a bit sickening.\"\n\nWho the hell could stand that?\n\nAt this moment, in the eyes of the beautiful Serpent Spirit, Lu Ding was no longer human, but a very, very large, grinding its mouthparts, and figuring out where on her head would be the best place to bite – a gigantic flying centipede!!\n\nLu Ding looked at the beautiful Serpent.\n\nHis eyes lit up. The ancients truly didn't lie to him; she was truly beautiful.\n\nThe [Dian Shi Zhai Pictorial] had a record:\n\n\"In the Jiaozhi Mountains, there is a strange serpent, its head like that of a beautiful woman, its hair luminous enough to serve as a mirror, with crimson lips and verdant brows, its demeanor enchanting, its two arms curved like snow-white lotus roots... The lower body is entirely serpentine, but its skin is slightly smooth and slippery. Its nature is to charm, and it excels at subduing tigers. If a tiger trifles with it, it will inevitably be harmed. The local people, unable to name it, call it the 'Beauty Serpent'...\"\n\nThe famous literary figure from his previous life, Mr. Zhou Shuren, also wrote about this in \"From Baicaoyuan to Sanwei Study.\"\n\nWhen he was little, Zhou Shuren wanted a flying centipede.\n\nBut Lu Ding was more precocious at the time; he only wanted to see for himself what kind of beauty the beautiful Serpent possessed.\n\nSeeing the real deal today, it was indeed true that seeing is believing; it really opened his eyes.\n\nBut now was a team fight.\n\nMonsters are never good.\n\nHe had just acquired the Dark Death Black Coffin Art; Lu Ding wanted to see how it worked!!!\n\nHe raised his hand, and streams of spiritual energy erupted, exuding an aura of decay.\n\n\"Dark Death Black Coffin, combine.\"\n\nThe space around the beautiful Serpent immediately rippled, and six blocks of varying sizes materialized. With a \"thud,\" black, decaying coffin panels interlocked to form a complete coffin.\n\nShe was trapped inside it, and the black coffin stood upright on the open ground.\n\nDarkness invaded, and in just an instant, the coffin dissipated.\n\nThe beautiful Serpent knelt on the ground, her hands limp, her head tilted back, gazing at the sky. Her entire body was stained black, and even her eyeballs were pure black.\n\nShe was as dead as could be.\n\n[Monster Contained: Beautiful Serpent]\n[Containment Reward: Serpent Devourer's Great Feast]\n\n[Serpent Devourer's Great Feast: Conjures a hell of ten thousand serpents, devouring enemies who suffer ten thousand serpent bites.]\n\nLu Ding's face broke into a smile.\n\nSerpent Devourer's Great Feast was another art. Team fights were great, team fights.\n\nTeam fights yielded many rewards; a single wave made him rich. Two arts instantly compensated for his lack of available arts.\n\nAs for whether they were truly not enough, Lu Ding just felt that he had gotten tired of using the old ones.\n\nIt was like clothes; new ones were always more comfortable to wear.\n\nYet another maxed-level art he'd never seen before. How many arts had he mastered to perfection?\n\nWen Ruchu, who was slumped on the ground, thought this to himself.\n\nThe bizarre slashes, the General's Armored Glyph Art, the divine flying art, the terrifying physical strength, and the Flying Bear Pounce and Kill Method...\n\nOne after another, item by item, were these truly things a human could cultivate?\n\nEven with unparalleled talent, could his energy truly be inexhaustible?\n\nSuddenly, a terrifying thought popped into Wen Ruchu's mind: Could it be that every day, besides beating people and monsters, Lu Ding just meditated?\n\nPracticing whenever he had a moment, the kind that never stopped.\n\nOtherwise, how did he cultivate all these things?\n\nOnly this explanation could barely make sense!\n\nThinking this, Wen Ruchu felt a strange mix of emotions.\n\nEven someone like Lu Ding worked so hard. What right did he have not to work hard?!\n\n\"Hey, are you two okay?\"\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted the moment the voice sounded.\n\nWen Ruchu looked up.\n\nAbove was a full moon. Before him was Lu Ding, dressed in his scholar-warrior sleeves, the man who had torn his mouth.\n\nBut when he stood before you, if you were an enemy, the sense of oppression you felt was like a giant wave sweeping across the world, crashing down on you.\n\nBut if you were a teammate, an ally, someone on his side, then it was like standing behind him, standing with him atop the highest mountain peak.\n\nLooking down upon all other mountains.\n\nThe pain in his body faded away.\n\nWen Ruchu stammered, \"Y-you... are you asking me?\"\n\n\"You could also be asking me!!\"\n\nYin Feng said with a playful grin, and did a carp's backflip to spring up from the ground.\n\n\"Who else is here besides you two?\"\n\nLu Ding was speechless. How could this person's brain stop working after just one beating?\n\nWen Ruchu got up.\n\nHe could hardly believe it; Lu Ding actually spoke to him?\n\nDidn't they have a conflict?\n\n\"Fit and healthy, easy-peasy, still ready to fight!!\"\n\nYin Feng said from the side.\n\nLu Ding nodded. Time was precious now; he needed to be faster. He heard the sounds of battle from the building in front of them.\n\nHe leaped forward in one stride.\n\nYan Feifan walked out of the darkness at this moment.\n\n\"Don't overthink it. The conflict between you and Brother Lu was just because you liked to meddle and talk nonsense. You didn't commit some damnable major crime or cross Brother Lu's bottom line; he won't bother to argue with you over it.\"\n\n\"Besides, I rarely hear Brother Lu praise people for being smart. He said you were very smart before.\"\n\nNormally, someone of Yan Feifan's caliber wouldn't be qualified to say such things to Wen Ruchu.\n\nBut now, the words coming from his mouth...\n\nWen Ruchu listened attentively.\n\n....\n\nAs the others conversed, the battle raged intensely inside the building ahead.\n\nThe man's fists flickered with electric arcs. He threw a punch, and a piercing sizzling sound echoed through the unfinished room.\n\nThe dark figure retreated.\n\nStanding by the window.\n\nIt was a cat-like monster the size of a leopard.\n\nIts body was covered in patterns, outlining all eighteen types of weapons, including blades, spears, swords, and halberds.\n\nIts white head looked like it had been attached afterward.\n\nIt licked its claws, which resembled tiger paws, and the monster spoke in human tongue: \"The power is there, but the accuracy is a bit off.\"\n\n\"You're a piece of *shit*! Brother Song, now!!!!\"\n\nOutside the window behind the monster, there should have been no one, but with Zuo Qianqiu's shout, a figure dropped from above. Wind blades spun in his hand, like a saw disc, and he aimed at the back of the monster's head and started sawing.\n\n\"Finally, I got to ambush you, didn't I!!\"\n\nSizzle, sizzle, sizzle...\n\nCutting sounds rang out. Amidst the flying sparks, it turned out to be a shield blocking Liang Yusong's attack.\n\nCorrespondingly, a section of the pattern on the monster's fur was empty, and that section had outlined a shield.\n\nIt turned its head to look: \"So there's another one. You hid quite well, and your aim is good too, just lacking a bit in power, otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to keep this head of mine.\"\n\n\"Hehe, it's always right to be cautious. My power might be lacking, but his power isn't bad.\"\n\n\"Take this punch!!!\"\n\nAgain, piercing electrical sounds. Having felt the power of Zuo Qianqiu's punch before, the monster dared not underestimate it, and immediately twisted its body to prepare to dodge.\n\nAs expected, the electric-arc-laced punch did not come down.\n\nInstead, it was a whip kick that swept the monster flying horizontally, shattering the wall and sending it tumbling into the air.\n\nAnd at its neck, propelled by the force of that kick, a gruesome, bleeding wound was cut open by the wind blade spinning in the other person's hand.\n\n\"Wasn't it a punch!!?\"",

    "content": "\"I changed my mind at the last minute, and didn't have time to shout. I'll shout now: 'Eat my kick!' Are you satisfied with that?\"\n\nThe monster, which hadn't thought much of it before, immediately flew into a rage upon hearing this person say such a line.\n\n\"Despicable human Qi Refiners, only daring to sneak attack! One is a good-for-nothing with only strength but no accuracy, the other is a good-for-nothing with only accuracy but no strength! Yet you dare to provoke me!!!!\"\n\nThe patterns on its body manifested as various weapons floating in the air, radiating waves of killing intent.\n\nFacing such a scene, Zuo Qianqiu and Liang Yusong immediately stood straight, their movements synchronized, raising their arms and waving them from side to side.\n\nThen, in unison, they shouted with drawn-out endings: \"See~~~ ya~~~!\"\n\nMonster: ?????\n\nIt was somewhat puzzled by what shenanigans these two human Qi Refiners were up to.\n\nThe next moment, the fur on its back suddenly bristled, its instinct telling it: Your time is up!!!\n\n\"Then try my accuracy and power!!\"\n\nLu Ding made his move from behind it, hovering in the air, his leg becoming a blade, striking downwards.\n\nBang!!!\n\nThe power imbued in this kick landed and made contact with the monster's flesh, colliding. Bones shattered and pierced through the skin, flesh and blood squeezed out from the wound, splattering everywhere. The monster, which had been extremely arrogant just moments before, was kicked to smithereens by Lu Ding.\n\n[Monster Contained: Liang Qu]\n[Containment Reward: Power to Command Weapons]\n[Power to Command Weapons: All manner of weapons under heaven can be picked up at will, manipulated as one desires.]\n\nLiang Qu.\nIt is recorded in the Shanhaijing, Central Mountains Classic:\n\"Seventy *li* further northeast, there is a mountain called Lishi Mountain. Its trees are mostly *jingqi*, and its sunny side has much..... There is a beast there, its shape like a cat, with a white head and tiger claws. Its name is Liang Qu. When it appears, that country will have a great war.\"\n\nThis is what it refers to. Wherever it appears, there will be conflict and war.\n\n\"Hey, Lu Ding!!\"\n\nLiang Yusong called out, catching Lu Ding's attention. He raised his thumb: \"Badass!\"\n\nThey had just seen Lu Ding, which was why they made those gestures.\n\nHow to put it? It's still that saying: life is boring and bland, you have to find fun in it. Otherwise, fighting monsters to the death day in and day out, you'd have lost your mind long ago.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding didn't know them, he still gave a thumbs-up back: \"You guys are badass too.\"\n\nHe then turned his head to look at the center of the most intense battle storm in the distance. There, was tonight's biggest BOSS.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding hadn't yet seen what this thing looked like, just from the aftershocks of the battle, he could feel its power. That was his goal.\n\nAlthough in terms of realm, Lu Ding was definitely not as strong as the two parties currently exuding battle prowess, his cheat finger had given him so many rewards precisely so he could fight above his level.\n\n\"That's a Diviner Realm battle. If we participate with our current realm, we'll die.\"\n\nOn the rooftop nearby, Bai Hemiao had quietly appeared at some point, half-crouching on a stone pillar, his brocade robes fully displaying his temperament. He saw what Lu Ding was thinking, and so he spoke.\n\nLu Ding hovered, his tone calm.\n\n\"I once said that the strong are born to oppress the weak. The law of the jungle, this is the unchanging fundamental law of nature since ancient times. However, most strong individuals are not born strong. Weaklings who dare to challenge the strong are the ones who have the foundation to become strong, but they must also be prepared to die. On the same level, defeating any number of equal beings cannot prove whether one is truly strong or weak. Only by defeating the strong, gnawing at their flesh and blood, and treading over their bones, can one achieve greater heights. Eagles strike the vast sky, fish glide in shallow depths, all creatures compete freely under the frosty sky.* Challenging, defeating, and slaying stronger beings – this is my most proficient domain.\"\n\nHaving received so many rewards, if he were only to squabble with small monsters, Lu Ding would be afraid of being laughed at. It's like playing a game: max-level with divine gear, and you run to the newbie village to hack at small goblins. Even Celia would say: \"Warrior, what the hell are you doing here? Get lost!\"\n\nBelow the tall building, Wen Ruchu and the others gathered around and listened to everything. Each of them had a thoughtful expression.\n\nWas Lu Ding's talk arrogant? Arrogant! Boundlessly arrogant. But if you think about it carefully, recalling his past deeds, most of them involved challenging, defeating, and slaying beings of a higher realm than himself. At this moment, they finally understood. In terms of mindset, Lu Ding was different from them.\n\n\"All creatures compete freely under the frosty sky,\" huh...?\n\nBai Hemiao listened from the side and asked: \"Is there a complete version, beginning to end?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"After this fight, let me copy it down.\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nAs the words fell, the two simultaneously charged towards the distant battlefield with the most terrifying battle prowess, becoming two specks. One soared through the sky, the other vanished into the darkness.\n\n\"Damn it, that whole scene got my blood boiling! That very instant, the two of them charged out together, one in the sky and one on the ground, it was so damn cool!!\" Zuo Qianqiu rubbed his fists, his voice somewhat agitated, saying: \"Brother Song, let's go too!!\"\n\n\"Go, go, go! The atmosphere is already like this, how can we not go? Charge!!!\"\n\nThe two rushed out of the building window. One used the wind to glide down, gently lifted by a breeze, drifting away, leveraging various points, covering over ten meters with each step. The other was wreathed in electric arcs, striding rapidly on the ground, leaving a trail of blue electric light behind him.\n\nRushing out with them were also Wen Ruchu and Yin Feng.\n\nAs for Yan Feifan, he was toying with the camera in his hand, bringing up the footage of Lu Ding and Bai Hemiao rushing out just now. He couldn't help but nod in satisfaction.\n\n\"If this photo is submitted to the Information Synthesis Department and published, I should be able to get quite a few contribution points.\"\n\nLast time, ever since he saw the photo taken by Ji Yanshuang that Lu Ding had rewarded, Yan Feifan started wondering, if Ji Yanshuang could take photos, then couldn't he too? Ji Yanshuang had merely chanced upon Lu Ding and recorded it. But he was with Brother Lu every day.\n\nSo he sent a message to someone in the Information Synthesis Department to ask. The result he got was that even though he wasn't a member of the Information Synthesis Department, he could submit his photos to them. There were two options: outright purchase or profit sharing. Hearing this, Yan Feifan decisively chose profit sharing.\n\nLater, he even spent a lot of money to buy a camera, always keeping it in the bag on his back, which was like a bottomless bag, just waiting to take it out and use it at any time. Just as Lu Ding was speaking, he quietly pulled it out, and as it happened, perfectly captured the moment the two charged out side by side. Although his technique wasn't very good, the fact that both Lu Ding and Bai Hemiao were handsome, coupled with the perfect surrounding architectural layout, directly compensated for his technical shortcomings.\n\nPutting his precious camera into his bag, Yan Feifan quietly disappeared underground, following them using a still somewhat clumsy dog paddle. He still remembered Lu Ding's words: Safety was paramount; everything was to prioritize his own safety. If he was slow, then so be it. He absolutely had to be safe. If anything happened, Brother Lu wouldn't be able to look after him, and he also didn't want to be a burden to Lu Ding.\n\n---\n*   \"Eagles strike the vast sky, fish glide in shallow depths, all creatures compete freely under the frosty sky.\" (A line from Mao Zedong's poem \"Qinyuanchun Changsha\".)",

    "content": "On the road.\n\nFeeling the lingering power of the battle ahead growing stronger and stronger.\n\nBai Hemian, in his hidden form, looked up at the sky.\n\nHe saw Lu Ding flying while simultaneously applying the 'General's Plate Armor Technique' to himself, his hands continuously compressing and gathering the spiritual energy within his body.\n\nThat vast amount of spiritual energy startled him.\n\nAt the same time, a question arose in his mind: how much spiritual energy did Lu Ding's Spirit Sea actually store!?\n\nAs Lu Ding repeatedly performed such actions, a heart-palpitating aura emanated, continuously growing thicker.\n\nBai Hemian's hair stood on end involuntarily.\n\nHe opened his mouth and asked, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nLu Ding's lips curved into a slight arc.\n\n\"Doing what? I'm going to cook up something big for it.\"\n\nThe lingering power ahead continued unabated; it seemed the battle between the monster and the 749 powerhouse had fallen into a stalemate.\n\nThis also highlighted something from another perspective.\n\nThe difference in strength between the monster and that powerhouse was not significant.\n\nNeither side had the strength to defeat the other in a short period.\n\nUnder this balance, it was a test of endurance, a test of external aid. This was Yunhai, 749's territory.\n\nCompared to the monster, 749's powerhouses would definitely arrive first.\n\nOnce other powerhouses from 749 arrived, there would only be one outcome for this monster.\n\nDeath!!!\n\nLu Ding couldn't quite accept this situation. After all, such a powerful monster would surely drop good items.\n\nTherefore, he needed to be one step ahead and replace the incoming 749 reinforcements, becoming the one to break the balance.\n\nThinking was easy, but doing it was hard.\n\nThose people were all Fated Life Realm powerhouses.\n\nNo matter how strong Lu Ding was, his strength was only enough to kill a not-so-formidable Spirit Palace.\n\nOf course, this was under the premise of one-on-one combat, representing his solo strength.\n\nBut this wasn't a solo fight now.\n\nHe had plenty of time to prepare, and someone was helping him draw fire.\n\nSince that was the case, he would use the most old-fashioned cast time.\n\nCounting all his abilities, what had the greatest offensive destructive power?\n\nIt wasn't the 'Serpent Devourer' or the 'Dark Death Black Coffin Technique' he had just acquired tonight, nor was it the 'Bloody Wind and Rain' formed by the fusion of the 'Wind Stabilization Technique' and 'Blood Rain Technique'.\n\nBut the simplest and most direct one: the Way of Jinche.\n\nCompared to the flashy descriptions of other techniques.\n\nWhen Lu Ding acquired this thing, it only had four big characters: 'Nothing It Can't Cut!!'\n\nMoreover, it had distinctions of quantity and quality.\n\nSimple, easy to understand, but with a high upper limit.\n\nCoupled with the 'General's Plate Armor,' which increased overall combat power, Lu Ding had been holding back since just now!\n\nHe was holding back, pouring all the spiritual energy in his body into the Way of Jinche, constantly pushing his limits.\n\nFurthermore, the 'Forgetful Self' he had never turned off continuously triggered 'Unity of Heaven and Man,' once again raising Lu Ding's upper limit. Through repeated compressions, he gained insights.\n\nEach time, he gained a deeper, newer understanding of the Way of Jinche.\n\nWith the Way of Jinche as the foundation, the General's Plate Armor reinforced the foundation and enhanced overall attributes, and Unity of Heaven and Man elevated the upper limit – full buffs applied directly.\n\nIf even this couldn't break the balance, Lu Ding still had a way.\n\nRun!\n\nWhat else could he do?\n\nHe couldn't possibly stay put and let himself be beaten to death.\n\nIt's not shameful for the weak to run away; that's called knowing the times.\n\nThe surging aura could no longer be suppressed; a terrifying aura was overflowing.\n\nBai Hemian felt the destruction stored within Lu Ding's body.\n\nAt this moment, he sped forward, clearing the way for it, his heart filled with anticipation for just how powerful this move of Lu Ding's would be.\n\nAt the same time.\n\nAt the central battlefield ahead, the traces left by the battle radiated for several kilometers around.\n\nA scene of ruins met the eye.\n\nIt seemed this place was slated for demolition.\n\nOn the scarred land, a figure crashed through a half-collapsed building.\n\nWith a loud rumble.\n\nThe building collapsed, and Shi Gandang stood up amidst the dust, patting his shoulder. An invisible impact emanated from his shoulder blade, striking the collapsed building and shattering it further.\n\n\"If it's just like this, you can't hurt me, nor can you keep me.\"\n\nHis true form was a stubborn rock that had endured countless years of wind and sun exposure; defense was his most prominent attribute.\n\nLi Xuanlong looked straight ahead: \"So you want to run?\"\n\nShi Gandang shook his head:\n\n\"I know this is your territory, and I shouldn't be causing trouble here. I also know that your reinforcements will arrive soon, and staying will only lead to my death.\"\n\n\"But!!!\"\n\n\"I want justice!!!\"\n\nShi Gandang roared, pointing straight at his heart: \"My heart tells me that if I leave today, I will be failing myself and the years my brother and I spent enduring wind and rain on the mountaintop!!!\"\n\n\"I will be abandoning him once again!!\"\n\n\"I can't even avenge him!!\"\n\nLi Xuanlong just watched him, not rushing to make a move. \"Go on, say whatever you want, say it for as long as you want. The longer you drag it out, the smaller your chances of escaping.\"\n\nReinforcements were already on their way.\n\nIf you drag it out a bit longer, you can save some money on compensation for the surrounding buildings.\n\nIf it were possible, he would be very willing to just talk and not fight, because he couldn't kill this thing; its skin was too thick, simply impenetrable.\n\nBut this guy couldn't do anything to him either.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nLetting out a deep breath, Shi Gandang controlled his emotions.\n\n\"I was once a guardian god for ordinary people, protecting them from evil calamities and demons and monsters.\"\n\n\"But I still have to live for myself, don't I?\"\n\n\"Now I just want to seek justice for my brother, why!!! Why won't you give it to me!!\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Li Xuanlong immediately overturned all his previous mental activity.\n\nHe couldn't hold back anymore.\n\n\"You're full of shit!!!\"\n\nStarting with a national essence, no wind-up time for the attack.\n\n\"Justice? Justice my foot! You yourself were shouting that you wanted us to be buried with your brother, those were your exact words. Now you don't want to admit it?\"\n\n\"What, is everyone being buried with your brother justice?\"\n\n\"Because you caused trouble and smashed so many buildings, we 749 have to pay so much money. Who the hell gives *us* justice!!?\"\n\n\"And you say we're unwilling to give it to you? For us to give you justice, does that mean we line up one by one for you to kill? Is that justice!?\"\n\n\"And besides, your brother couldn't pass his human tribulation; it wasn't like someone was targeting him. What, in the path of cultivation, everyone else must walk a difficult road, but your brother must have smooth sailing!?\"\n\n\"Demons and monsters emerge into the world to undergo tribulation; this is a law of heaven and earth, a natural rule. If you want justice, go find the Old Man in the Sky and ask him why he set the rules this way.\"\n\n\"Don't talk to us about these things.\"\n\nShi Gandang's face turned red from being rebutted, unable to speak, because every word the human in front of him said was reasonable.\n\nYet, completely reasonable truths often sting the most.\n\nShi Gandang's aura surged around him, his state of mind on the verge of explosion.\n\nBut suddenly, his aura halted abruptly. It was the familiar formula, the familiar taste; in the blowing wind, he felt a familiar aura.\n\nJust like the beautiful snake spirit.\n\nBut there was one difference: one felt an archenemy, while the other felt an old acquaintance.\n\nHe looked up.\n\nSeeing a figure flying towards him, carrying an aura that was both familiar and strange, Shi Gandang's pupils contracted sharply at that moment. With his enemy before him, his aura burst forth without reservation.\n\n\"Give me back my brother's life!!!\"\n\nLi Xuanlong reacted swiftly, immediately circulating spiritual energy through his body. A purple light shimmered, and the spectral image of a deity holding a treasured sword rose from the ground.\n\nJust as he was preparing to re-enter the battle, he heard Bai Hemian shout loudly from behind.\n\n\"Teacher Li, move out of the way!!!\"\n\nRecognizing it was Bai Hemian, whom he had once taught, Li Xuanlong dodged aside.\n\nThe next second.\n\nThe accumulated strike, prepared all the way, burst forth from Lu Ding's hand. The terrifying recoil made his entire body jerk back for a moment.\n\nThe essence of 'Nothing It Can't Cut' diffused with a sense of sharpness, cutting through everything within the attack's range.\n\nThe atmosphere in the field was quiet; the sound of battle from afar, diminished by distance, was barely audible.\n\nClick... click-click-click... Boom...\n\nNumerous buildings, leaning precariously on the ground, simultaneously emitted cracking sounds at this moment, breaking the eerie silence. As a rumbling sound arose,\n\nthese buildings collapsed once again, revealing neat incisions.\n\nShi Gandang slowly lowered his head, watching a red line gradually appear on his chest.",

Now Shi Gan was defeated and was re-created. It was the time to take advantage of his illness to kill him.\n\nThe god who held the treasure sword only swung the magic sword in his hand and slashed it down. The ten-meter-meter sword brought the powerful force of the evil Piyi to cut it off.\n\n\"I want you to die\"\n\nDragging his body to hurt his body, Shi Gan raised his hand to resist Li Xuanlong's blow, and the blood that was cut in his chest was even more harmful.\n\nThe square ground collapsed instantly\n\nHe bent his legs and prepared to jump. During this moment, Bai Yumian raised his hand and pinched it.\n\n\"seal up\"\n\nDarkness engulfs, dyeing the surrounding\n\nHe raised his hand and pointed to the Cauldron backwards.

Because there were too many veins, a huge ball soon emerged.\n\nBai Yumian pinched and said slowly: \"Wanbakuen\"\n\nAbove the sky, the two hands of the tripod, overlap and knock\n\nDuo\n\nA strange wave of silence moved away, raised his hand and made a claw, and he was able to meet the skull of thousands of corpses.\n\n\"Snake Ghoul\"\n\nThere are wavy patterns on the ground, and the huge triangular snake head snatches out of it and eats thousands of slaughter pots in one bite, making the picture change\n\nShi Ganqi fell into the flesh and blood channel, up and down, left and right, in the sky and earth, even if it was a snake's heaven and earth\n\nAs he arrived, countless poisonous snakes of various colors shot and bit themBut that's not the end\n\nOne move comes out again and again\n\nJust listen\n\n\"Dark Death in the Black Coffin\"\n\nIn the empty space, there are six decaying shrubs of different sizes that are coming from each other, including the six directions: up, down, left, left, front, back and back.\n\nShi Gan took both hands and took action\n\n\"You think you can kill me.\"\n\n\"Then let me come\"\n\nThe illusion around was torn apart by a huge divine sword, bringing the divine sound aura, attached to the overwhelming power, and one piercing fell, leaving huge divine marks, which ran through hundreds of meters, leaving deep cracks on the earth\n\nFrom the beginning, the cooperation between the Sun Ding and Bai Jumian was just a feint, just to control and distract Shi Gandan's attention, causing damage to him.\n\nThe final killing was Li Xuanlong, a person who was in the strong Siming Realm, and a sword cut off the qi movement inside his body severely.\n\nA bloodline appears from Shi Gan as the number header and gradually goes downward\n\n\"I won't\"\n\nThe trunk appears in the air, raise your hand, and the breath is swelling\n\nA little further back\n\nAnother wave of power was charged and burst out from his hands, and the plan was to pass Shi Gan to hold his neck, and his head was shaking the sky\n\nAlthough this is not as powerful as the move that started the cauldron to accumulate strength all the way, Shi Gan now has broken the foundation and destroyed the spirit.\n\nIt's like hard energy\n\nYou can't run Qi, you are nothing\n\nSo the attack of the dynasty easily cut off Shi Ganying's brain and sent him away for the last journey\n\n[Containing Monster: Shi Gandao (Shi)]\n\n[Housing Award: Shacheng Reincarnation Monument]\n\n[The reincarnation of the evil town: The monument of the evil town, which brings the power of the town to suppress the evil town.

There is no silence or a little overwhelming action, as if they know the thoughts of the other party in the blink of an eye.\n\nBai Yumian was in trouble with his terrifying body. The young man in front of him took action to attack with his terrifying body, and then caused damage to Shi Ganzhan, allowing Bai Yumian to gather Qi in his body and use the reunion of the domain.\n\nRestrict monsters' movements\n\nThis terrifying boy in his body raised his hand and two full-level techniques, which would restrict the monster twice and three times.\n\nFinally, he, Li Xuanlong, came to add a key knife\n\nThis makes him feel like a high-level player is inexplicably driven by a low-level player.\n\nAnd none of these are the most important\n\nThe most important thing is that this young man came with tricks. It was so terrifying that he almost gave the monster two and a half of his waist.\n\nThat's a monster that he can't even break.He would have been cut like this with one move\n\nIf it weren't for that move, Li Xuanlong guessed that he could only deal with the monster, and then waited for the support to arrive. During the time during this process, the monster said that he would not run away\n\nBut if it really doesn't run or it doesn't run, only it knows\n\nIf it was let go and caused such a big destruction, it would be awesome\n\nTurn around and look at the building that was chopped down by the calender\n\nLi Xuanlong: Grass\n\nThis is even more destructive",

    "content": "Bai Hemian sat on the ground, drained of strength, his face a little pale.\n\nHe smiled, looking at Lu Ding, whose expression was as usual.\n\nAs expected, terrifyingly strong!!\n\nThen, recalling how the two of them, working together, had left that monster—comparable to a Sīmìng Realm being—with no power to fight back, one move after another, seamlessly linking various bizarre techniques.\n\nHe felt incredibly exhilarated again!\n\nCombat, this is how it should be.\n\nIn the past, he hadn't wanted teammates because he felt they struggled to keep up with his rhythm and couldn't coordinate with his methods.\n\nBut Lu Ding was different.\n\nWhether it was spirit arts or physical body, both could echo Bai Hemian's techniques.\n\nWith the two of them coordinating, they fully achieved a result where one plus one was greater than two.\n\nThis was something Bai Hemian had never dared to imagine before.\n\nWith those other teammates, he would already be thanking the heavens if they could maintain a power where one plus one equaled two; how could he dare ask for more?\n\nLu Ding walked over at this moment and extended his hand.\n\nBai Hemian took hold of it and stood up from the ground.\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"I can still fight another round.\"\n\nSeeing him still talking tough despite his condition, Lu Ding couldn't help but say, \"You're really f***ing good at bragging, hahahahaha...\"\n\nBai Hemian: ......\n\nAlthough it was a bit different from the answer he had imagined.\n\nBut this feeling of genuineness and complete unreservedness was truly comfortable.\n\nLi Xuanlong walked over: \"You two have really big guts, daring to come and get involved in a Sīmìng battle while only in the Spirit Sea Realm. If he had just freed up a bit of his hand, you two would have been crippled.\"\n\n\"It's fine, I can escape.\"\n\n\"I can fly.\"\n\nLi Xuanlong: .......\n\nSo, I'm the one who got beaten up, huh?!\n\nLooking at the star on Lu Ding's shoulder, Li Xuanlong paused, bewildered: an intern?\n\nHe seemed to have realized something: \"Are you Lu Ding?\"\n\nLu Ding nodded: \"Yes, Leader, my name is Lu Ding.\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, what leader? Just call me Instructor Li, or like Xiao Bai, call me Teacher Li.\"\n\nAs expected, just like Section Chief Deng said, he's very polite.\n\nLi Xuanlong thought to himself.\n\nHe walked over, took out a cigarette and offered it to Lu Ding, then lit it for him, saying, \"You've worked hard, have a cigarette. Section Chief Deng told me about you. Lately, I've heard quite a few rumors about you. I thought the rumors were exaggerated, but I never expected that seeing you today would be even more exaggerated.\"\n\n\"With the performance from you two, there's basically no suspense for this year's Yuánnián Martial Arts Debates. If you ask me, what's even the point of competing?\"\n\n\"Just take two spots directly and send you two for advanced studies and further training.\"\n\nAlthough that's what was said, and it seemed to be the truth, regulations cannot be messed with.\n\nRules are rules. Without rules, nothing can be accomplished.\n\nThe sounds of battle in the distance gradually weakened, and more complex auras mixed in. This was the result of 749's reinforcements arriving.\n\nSensing this situation, Lu Ding felt relieved that he had rushed over at the first opportunity. Otherwise, this BOSS would have slipped through his fingers.\n\n\"Alright, people have arrived, and you two have worked hard. Go back and get some good rest. After today's events are over, Cloud Sea will probably be quiet for a while.\"\n\n\"You two go back and relax for a bit. Wait for news to come to the bureau for a meeting to discuss merits and confer rewards.\"\n\n\"I'll give you two a heads-up: with your performance, you've probably secured the top credit, especially you.\"\n\nThis last \"you\" referred specifically to Lu Ding.\n\nLi Xuanlong smiled: \"The news of the Hundred Ghosts Night Parade was spread by you, and now this mastermind was also critically wounded after you broke its defense, helping to kill it. Lu Ding, this time you've hit the jackpot.\"\n\n\"Have you thought about what you want? I'll go back and talk to Section Chief Deng and get you something you want.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that break the rules?\"\n\nLu Ding asked casually.\n\n\"Oh, come on, rules aren't that rigid. For example, if someone who's rendered meritorious service lacks heavenly materials and earthly treasures to expand their Spirit Sea, and you give them a good cultivation method, it's good, but it's not a 'just-needed' item.\"\n\n\"Or, if someone isn't lacking heavenly materials and earthly treasures, but lacks a cultivation method, and you give them a magical artifact, while it can be used, it's also not a 'just-needed' item.\"\n\nThat made some sense.\n\nLu Ding thought for a moment. His methods didn't seem to require any magical artifacts, and his current cultivation methods were sufficient; he could change them later if needed.\n\nCurrently, what he most lacked were heavenly materials and earthly treasures to open up his Spirit Sea.\n\nWhat else could provide more security than one's own strength?\n\nNothing!\n\nStrength was the most important.\n\nEverything else was just for show.\n\n\"I want heavenly materials and earthly treasures to open up my Spirit Sea.\" He wasn't modest, directly stating his needs.\n\n\"I also want heavenly materials and earthly treasures.\"\n\nBai Hemian added.\n\n\"Alright, alright, alright, I'll go back and talk to Section Chief Deng and prepare heavenly materials and earthly treasures for you two. As for things here, that's it for now. I need to quickly send this thing's corpse back to headquarters.\"\n\nAfter Li Xuanlong spoke, he immediately grabbed Shígǎndāng's body, which was split in two, leaped away, and left.\n\nLu Ding and Bai Hemian also got up and left.\n\nEverything was over.\n\nWhy stay here?\n\nMight as well go back and rest up properly.\n\nSensing Yan Feifan's aura, Lu Ding flew to a high slope, reached out, and pulled him out from under a large tree.\n\n\"Ptooey, ptooey, ptooey... Brother Lu, are you guys done?\"\n\nSpitting out dirt and sand, Yan Feifan asked.\n\nLu Ding nodded: \"Tonight should be it. Why did you hide here?\"\n\nYan Feifan patted the camera in his hand: \"It's safe here, and I have a commanding view. I took some photos, then I'll submit them to the Information Integration Department to earn some money.\"\n\n\"So, are you done taking photos?\"\n\n\"Done, done. Nothing more to photograph.\"\n\n\"When we're done, we'll leave. I'll treat you two to hotpot.\"\n\n\"Is it still that place from last time?\" Yan Feifan asked.\n\n\"Of course, I wasn't full last time.\"\n\n\"But Brother Lu, it's late, so will they even be open?\"\n\nHearing this, Lu Ding slightly raised his head: \"We have money. Spending tens of thousands to make the boss work overtime, that's not a problem, right?\"\n\nUnder the moonlight, the silhouettes of the three stretched out, slowly fading into the distance.\n\n......\n\nThe next day.\n\nThe battle report was released, and posts about Lu Ding and Bai Hemian even topped the popularity charts on the 749 forum.\n\nThat photo of them charging out side-by-side, due to Yan Feifan's unsteady hand, had a slight motion blur. Yet, it was this very flaw that, in that atmosphere, became the perfect finishing touch.\n\n[No way, no way, too handsome, too handsome, how can it be this handsome ah]\n\n[As expected, powerful individuals always appreciate each other.]\n\n[Superficial people, you only focus on the photos, but haven't paid attention to the deeper meaning within. Lu Ding's words are the main point, alright?]\n\n[Challenging, defeating, slaying stronger existences—that is my most proficient domain. Listen, listen, how f***ing arrogant is that? And the arrogance is well-founded.]\n\n[Both arrogant and handsome, and it's all true. His famous battle: killing Yuan Baifeng. In the Illumination Sphere Realm, killing Spirit Sea Realm beings. Do you accept that?\n\nA single person, with an Illumination Sphere Realm cultivation, resolving an overlapping Yin Domain. Do you accept that?\n\nIn the Illumination Sphere Realm, killing living corpses. Do you accept that?\n\nIn Cao Jiaxiang, in the Spirit Sea Realm, killing Divine Palace Realm beings. Do you accept that?\n\nNow, assisting a Sīmìng Realm being to kill a monster comparable to a Sīmìng Realm being. Damn it, why isn't such a legendary life mine!!]",

    "content": "......\n\nA group of people below chimed in.\n\nSpeaking of Caojia Alley, one couldn’t help but mention the two members of the Tianli Cult who were taken away by 749 this morning for scattering rhinoceros powder*.\n\nWhen they saw the 749 staff.\n\nTheir eyes instantly reddened.\n\n“You’re finally here, you’re finally here, wuwuwuwu......”\n\n“The local Qi Refiners of Baofan District are too rude; they ganged up on us. Up and down, it was full of old immortals and fierce soldiers, there was no room to stand, wuwuwu.......”\n\n“Over a hundred Qi Refiners..... just beating the two of us like this, and so many old immortals too.......”\n\n“They even tortured us privately, wuwuwuwu.”\n\n“Freshly cooked yellow rice! They just dipped it in cold water and force-fed it to us, claiming it was a tradition from their hometown, wuwuwuwu......”\n\n“It’s obvious they’re bullying me because I’m not a northerner and don’t understand. Isn’t this how you deal with human traffickers†.......”\n\n“....Please take us away quickly, we confess, we’ll tell you everything.......”\n\nThe professionally trained 749 staff were originally very professional and generally wouldn’t laugh.\n\nBut now, they really couldn’t hold it back.\n\nThe smiles at the corners of their mouths simply couldn’t be suppressed.\n\nTo think that even members of the Tianli Cult would have a day like this.\n\nThey couldn’t help but wonder in their hearts what exactly Tang Bao and the others had done to these two.\n\n“Alright, alright, stop wailing. Aren’t you full of life, still able to cry?”\n\n“My intestines are almost cooked, sir.”\n\n“What’s that got to do with me? If you didn’t cause trouble, would we treat you like this?”\n\nAfter saying this, the man took out a silk banner from behind him and handed it to Tang Bao, who was silently standing by.\n\n“Hall Master Tang, to thank you for protecting Baofan District last night, here is a silk banner. After our decision, all currently registered members of your Five Organs Life Society will now be external members of our 749.”\n\n“After this, we will issue you special identification cards and mobile phones.”\n\nHearing this.\n\nTang Bao and the members of the Five Organs Life Society behind him were all grinning ear to ear.\n\nAlthough not officially on the payroll.\n\nBut if I say I’m from 749, who would dare to object!!!?\n\nLet alone in Baofan District, even in Yunhai, you wouldn’t find a second group like them.\n\nTang Bao straightened his clothes and solemnly accepted the silk banner.\n\n“Thank you, organization, thank you, leaders, thank you, Brother Lu.”\n\nThe 749 man smiled: “The one you should thank most is Director Lu. He personally called the Aftermath Department last night.”\n\nThat was all that needed to be said; Tang Bao understood anyway.\n\nOther thanks were spoken aloud, but for Lu Ding, Tang Bao truly took it to heart.\n\nTouching the silk banner in his hand, the feeling was even more exhilarating than earning a hundred million.\n\nIt wasn’t easy, truly not easy. All this way, he actually led the Five Organs Life Society to shore!!!\n\nAfter the 749 staff departed.\n\nTang Bao waved his hand grandly.\n\n“Set up a banquet! For three consecutive days! Everyone who comes gets a share! Take out thirty million for red envelopes and distribute them! Give them to everyone you see!!!”\n\n.....\n\nLianhu Scenic Area, about ten kilometers from the Yunhai 749 Headquarters.\n\nBeneath white walls and blue tiles.\n\nLu Ding, Bai Hemian, and Yan Feifan were all in suits, standing tall and straight.\n\nThere was a meeting tonight, and nothing to do in the jurisdiction. After yesterday’s incident, all the demons and monsters were wiped out in one fell swoop, ensuring peace and tranquility for a short period.\n\nAs it happened to be a good day.\n\nThe three of them suggested coming to a nearby place to relax and enjoy nature.\n\nAnd conveniently, let Bai Hemian copy some great person’s work; it was more atmospheric here.\n\n“I’m ready.”\n\nBai Hemian said, holding his brush.\n\nThen Lu Ding’s voice rose with the gentle breeze, and the leaves rustled.\n\n“Alone I stand in the autumn cold, on the tip of Orange Island, the Xiang River flowing northward.”\n\n“I see a thousand hills crimsoned through by the sylvan dyes, and rivers turned emerald green with a hundred barges vying for speed.”\n\nBai Hemian moved his brush, leaving strong, vigorous characters.\n\n“Eagles cleave the air, fish glide in the shallows; under the frosty sky a million creatures contend for freedom.”\n\nAs he recited up to this point, Yan Feifan, who was adjusting his camera, channeled his energy, giving the gentle breeze a push, causing fallen leaves to dance and Lu Ding’s hair to sway.\n\n“All things are vibrant. On this vast earth, who rules over man’s destiny?”\n\n“I recall how, with a hundred comrades, I once roamed here, remembering those magnificent, dense years of the past.”\n\nToday was the location for 749’s summary meeting to recognize achievements and bestow rewards. There weren’t many scenic spots nearby, and only this one was the most famous.\n\nSo today, many investigators came here.\n\nAmong them were Lu Ding’s former classmates, now 749’s intern investigators, Liu Yun and Chu Hao. Accompanying them was another well-known 749 figure, the Jade Guanyin, Tantai Xuanyue.\n\nSeeing the crowd gathering ahead, each face familiar, they all looked in that direction.\n\nThe group followed and walked over.\n\nThey then heard people softly discussing.\n\n“Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke‡—whoever came up with this nickname, it’s a brilliant pun, ‘dissecting corpses’ and ‘solving poems’.”\n\n“Skilled in both civil and martial arts, no wonder he wore civil and martial sleeves yesterday.”\n\n“Who would have thought that such a brutal Lu Ding had this side to him? Originally, I thought, ‘My strength isn’t as high as his, oh well.’ ‘My talent isn’t as good as his, oh well.’ But now, even my culture isn’t as high as his—this is a bit much to overlook.”\n\n“What? Are you going to be like an extra in a novel and go compare poetic skill with Lu Ding?”\n\n“Are you crazy? Why compare poetic skill? Of course, I’m admiring him.”\n\n“He looks good, the verses sound good, one recites, one writes, one records—I’m a bit envious of them. If only I could become one of them.”\n\n“Damn it, the more I think about it, the angrier I get. My friends and I are all getting foot massages, while they’re reciting verses and writing poems. No wonder they’re awesome.”\n\nTantai Xuanyue listened to these people’s discussions.\n\nAnd heard Lu Ding’s voice continuously coming through.\n\n“Full of the vigor of youth, we were students, bold and unafraid, we pointed at the rivers and mountains, wrote stirring words, regarding the feudal lords of those days as dirt!!”\n\n“Do you remember how, in the middle of the river, we struck the water, and the waves checked our flying boats?”\n\nAfter hearing the whole thing, applause erupted all around.\n\nLiu Yun and Chu Hao’s gazes shifted, their expressions relaxed, as they fixedly watched that person.\n\nSuddenly, they felt so close, yet so far away.\n\nThe only chance they had to intersect was missed just like that.\n\nOnce gone, there would be no more opportunities, as if two threads that met at only one point, once missed, would never meet again.\n\nRegret flowed softly in their hearts.\n\nBut there was no medicine for regret sold in the world.\n\nLooking at Lu Ding, a thought vaguely crossed Chu Hao’s mind: perhaps in the future, when Lu Ding became famous, having once endured a strike from him would also be an honor.\n\nAfter all, up until now.\n\nOf those who had received Lu Ding’s strikes, it seemed he was the only one who had survived.\n\nIsn’t that an honor?\n\nLu Ding was aware of his colleagues gathering. After reciting the great person’s work, he cast them a smile.\n\nSaying, “Thank you.”\n\nWith a click, Yan Feifan pressed the shutter.\n\nThe sunlight slanted through, dappling through the forest leaves, and Lu Ding’s smile was so gentle.\n\nEveryone just felt that.\n\nWhen he was calm, he didn’t seem so terrifying......\n\nProvided, of course, that you didn’t disturb his peace.\n\nOtherwise, if the gentle Lu Ding turned around, approaching you would be Lu Ding—the official 749 Investigator, Baofan District’s Director, who once used Zhaoxuan to kill Linghai, Linghai to kill Shenggong, and Linghai to severely wound Siming, and who was given the nickname Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke!!!\n\n---\n* The original Chinese phrase \"放生犀散\" (fàngshēng xīsàn) literally means \"releasing and scattering rhinoceros powder.\" Given the context of the Tianli Cult and 749, it suggests an illicit ritual involving scattering some substance, possibly a drug or a harmful powder.\n† This is a specific form of interrogation/torture technique, often used on human traffickers (especially those who kidnap children) to prevent them from swallowing objects (like a tongue or poison) or to make them talk due to extreme discomfort and fear.\n‡ \"Corpse-Dissecting Grand Duke\" (解屍太歲, Jiěshī Tàisuì) is a pun. \"解屍\" (jiěshī) means to dissect a corpse, while \"解詩\" (jiěshī), a homophone, means to analyze or solve a poem. The nickname implies Lu Ding's dual capabilities in both brutal combat and refined literary skill.",

    "content": "A group of colleagues gathered around Lu Ding and chatted with him.\n\nHe turned no one away, chatting with them about everyday matters.\n\nFrom time to time, they exchanged contact information and took photos.\n\nWatching all this, Dantai Xianyue couldn't help but wonder, \"How are Qi Refiners also star-chasers?\"\n\nAlthough she had enjoyed such treatment in the past, in terms of her colleagues' enthusiasm, numbers, and popularity, she couldn't compare to Lu Ding at all.\n\nBut she also understood that not being able to compare was normal.\n\nIs this even a person?\n\nThis is completely and utterly a succubus, endlessly radiating charm.\n\nFrom top to bottom, from inside to out, whether it was his outward appearance or his inner strength, there was absolutely no fault to find with Lu Ding.\n\nToo perfect.\n\nSo perfect, it was as if he wasn't on the same layer as everyone else.\n\nDantai Xianyue didn't push through the crowd to go forward.\n\nShe just watched.\n\nAs for why she didn't leave, they all said Lu Ding was a succubus; how could she be spared?\n\nNight.\n\n749 Auditorium.\n\nEveryone crowded around Lu Ding as he entered.\n\nThey took their seats.\n\nSeeing that there was still some time before the meeting started.\n\nYan Feifan chatted idly beside him.\n\n\"Brother Lu, I've been thinking, the things that have happened recently really do seem like a novel.\"\n\nLu Ding looked over: \"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"Look, starting with that kid Tong Yong, if we hadn't been involved, he probably would have resolved whatever was on Miss Ji, then he'd be targeted by Ling Gu, and by a stroke of luck—if it were a novel, do you think he should get the Wind-Settling Pearl?\"\n\nAccording to novel development, if it were a bit cliché, this would indeed be a treasure delivery.\n\nLu Ding nodded: \"If it were a bit cliché, then yes.\"\n\n\"And then there's this: when I was looking at the files earlier, guess what I found? Tong Yong was caught by that female police officer who was then captured by the Five Viscera Society. According to novel development, a feisty police officer, that's one of the harem members!\"\n\n\"Maybe later, Tong Yong will get into a conflict with the Five Viscera Society to save her.\"\n\n\"Although the Old Immortals on the Tang Family Three Brothers of the Five Viscera Society are quite powerful, the one on Tong Yong isn't bad either. Plus, the Tang Family Three Brothers didn't actually want to kill the female police officer.\"\n\n\"When Tong Yong goes there, they'd give him face and take the easy way out*—that's something Tang Bao would do. Using this opportunity...\"\n\n\"Maybe Tang Bao would even recruit him into the Five Viscera Society, or form an alliance. From there, he could learn more about the Qi Refiner circle, and then use the Five Viscera Society's power to seize the Wind-Settling Pearl. The logic would just close perfectly.\"\n\nLu Ding almost wanted to laugh; Yan Feifan's thought process was still so unconventional.\n\nHe continued to listen.\n\n\"Then there's Ye Xuan. The place where Ye Xuan dealt with the White-Haired Hou was near Dinghao Residential Area. And those monsters in Dinghao Residential Area are so sneaky, they were probably startled by him.\"\n\n\"And he also has the idea of opening the tomb. At that time, maybe he'll be the one to kill the Molted Living Corpse, but unlike you, Brother Lu...\"\n\n\"Didn't the Molted Living Corpse have a mask on its face that you, Brother Lu, shattered along with its body?\"\n\n\"If Ye Xuan had taken that mask...\"\n\n\"Miss Cheng, the reporting party, had her husband replaced, and he works at a subsidiary of the Sihai Group. Following this development, perhaps the two of them might meet one day.\"\n\n\"Then this General might recognize Ye Xuan as his own general.\"\n\nSeeing Lu Ding's smile almost break, Yan Feifan hurriedly explained: \"Seriously, Brother Lu, it's a stretch, but it makes sense!\"\n\n\"Look again: that General recognizes Ye Xuan as a general. Didn't Ye Feng go to Caojia Alley? From what I saw, he has a good relationship with Caojia Alley.\"\n\n\"Ye Feng has never come down before. This means that the one with a good relationship with Caojia Alley isn't him, but Daheishan.\"\n\n\"They're all from Daheishan. If Ye Feng can go, then Ye Xuan definitely can too. Won't that connect him to Cao Yuan?\"\n\n\"Cao Yuan's mother brought in vampires, and Cao Yuan also has ideas about the Sihai Group.\"\n\n\"Putting it this way, Ye Xuan's feelings for Xie Shunan are practically spilling out of his eyes. Thinking about it in reverse, when Cao Yuan's mother finds out about Ye Xuan, she might try to win him over.\"\n\n\"Given the personality he's shown, something might even happen between him and Cao Yuan's mother.\"\n\n\"Then it would be the elderly woman seeing the error of her ways, and Ye Xuan leading a group of ghost soldier subordinates to fight vampires.\"\n\nI treat you like a brother, but you're eyeing my mom.\n\nThinking of this, Lu Ding had a hard time suppressing his laughter.\n\n\"It really is like a novel, quite outlandish, but it has a plot and some selling points. Though probably not many people would read it, because few could stomach such a brainless plot.\"\n\n\"And the character designs for these two are also brainless.\"\n\nYan Feifan also felt the plot was a bit bad.\n\nBut it's okay.\n\n\"Isn't that where you, Brother Lu, come in? With your appearance, the plot won't be bad anymore.\"\n\n\"With your presence, it's like kicking the idiotic male lead and punching the brainless plot. If I were a reader, embodying you, I'd probably die from pure satisfaction!\"\n\n\"Alright, you can just die from pure satisfaction then. I think if you weren't a Qi Refiner, you could go write novels. With your imagination, you could definitely get rich from it.\"\n\nYan Feifan folded his arms and leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"I think that makes sense too. When I'm old and can't work anymore, or my cultivation gets stuck and can't advance, I'll write novels. I'll write all your deeds into them and make the readers die from pure satisfaction!\"\n\n\"I've even thought of a title.\"\n\nThis piqued Lu Ding's interest: \"What's it called?\"\n\n\"The Lu Ding Records. I even have illustrations!\"\n\nLu Ding: ......\n\n\"You......\"\n\n\"Hmm......\"\n\n\"Don't use that name, I beg you.\"\n\nIt wasn't that it was bad; it was just that hearing those three words, Lu Ding inexplicably felt a bit embarrassed.\n\n\"Change it? What would be a good one to change to?\"\n\nYan Feifan folded his arms, his eyes full of thought.\n\nIt seemed he was really treating this as a serious problem.\n\nAs people gradually arrived, the lights dimmed.\n\nA staff member with a microphone walked onto the stage.\n\n\"As per usual custom, once the Ghost Festival ends and this meeting concludes, in a few days it will be our annual Martial Arts Tournament. So today, I'll first warm up the atmosphere for all colleagues.\"\n\n\"It is said that on the fifteenth of this year's Ghost Festival, right in the seventh lunar month, there was a Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts.\"\n\nDing.\n\nMusic began, a grim and terrifying tune setting the atmosphere.\n\n\"It was spirits borrowing the path, mortals making way, beginning in Wenqiu and ending in Fengyang.\"\n\nTwo beams of light descended, shining on the seats of the Wenqiu District and Fengyang District Patrol Offices respectively.\n\nOn the large screen, the image split into four, showing the current expressions of the four patrol officers.\n\nTwo looked awkward, two wore faint smiles.\n\nSnap, the music picked up again, becoming urgent.\n\nThe person on stage walked rapidly to one side, with sound effects playing footsteps—*pitter-patter-pitter-patter*—with every step.\n\n\"From the Yuanfeng Crematorium in Wenqiu District, it was a cacophony of drums and gongs, with suona leading the way, bringing with it gusts of ghostly wind. Look at those pale faces—black, red, yellow, green, and most of all, white~ ones.\"\n\n\"The black ones were burnt, the red ones suffocated, the yellow ones drowned, the green ones poisoned, and the white ones were the faces of the dead...\"\n\n---\n*   \"take the easy way out\": An idiom meaning to seize an opportunity to back down gracefully or to give someone an excuse to avoid an awkward situation.",

That Anhong was blind is forgivable. But from Baofan, a message was sent, reaching the highest authority!\"\n\nYan Feifan quietly leaned over. \"Brother Lu, find this interesting?\"\n\nLu Ding nodded. \"A little.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you something, and you'll find it even more interesting.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The storyteller up there... that's our Bureau's Deputy Director Chu.\"\n\nLu Ding: ???????\n\nThis was really...\n\nLife's not easy; even the Director has to perform on the side.\n\n\"Taisi assembled its forces, Fengyang opened for battle!!\"\n\n\"The fight sent Spiritual Qi surging and Yin Qi drifting! They speak of a patrolling officer from Baofan, with the surname Lu and given name Ding! Born with a handsome face, possessed of great skill!

In advance, he can slay the Shi Gandang,¹ seize the highest honor, and make his name known throughout Yunhai!!\"\n\n\"BRAVO!!!!\"\n\nYan Feifan mustered his courage and shouted. The man was talking about Brother Lu; if he didn't go all out today, it would be a disservice to all the care Brother Lu had shown him.\n\nHe began to applaud loudly.\n\nThe Deputy Director on stage looked over, his eyes conveying approval.\n\n*You're the one who knows how to play along.*\n\nWith his lead and the Deputy Director's meaningful glance, if the others didn't get the hint, they would have been terribly unperceptive.\n\nThey immediately joined in the applause, and the atmosphere instantly became electric.\n\n\"They say this Lu Ding has by his side a good friend, with the surname Bai and given name Hemian! He wields the art of Corpse Mountains and Blood Seas, yet he walks the great path of light! He befriends the heroes among men, and he earns merits by slaying demons and exorcising devils!!!\"\n\n\"And so, with a round of applause, let's welcome the two top heroes of the Ghost Festival, Lu Ding and Bai Hemian!!!!\"\n\nThe spotlights fell, illuminating the two men.\n\nIn that instant, the applause was thunderous. Yan Feifan's expression was ecstatic, his hands nearly red from clapping.\n\nBai Hemian and Lu Ding stood up.\n\nBoth were dressed in custom-tailored suits that highlighted their dispositions. They were handsome, each with his own brand of charisma.\n\nLu Ding's handsomeness was that of an ancient sculpture, a face like crowned jade, with a dignified and imposing bearing.\n\nBai Hemian's handsomeness was in his straight nose and thin lips, bright eyes and white teeth, with sword-like brows slanting towards his temples.\n\nLu Ding walked in front, Bai Hemian followed behind.\n\nAs they stepped onto the stage, there was a *bang*, and golden paper rained down, turning into a sky full of golden rain. The lights hit them, illuminating the two men standing amidst the shower, giving them the grand air of having achieved success and fame.\n\nLu Ding had originally thought today's meeting would be rigid and boring; he hadn't expected it to be so refreshingly unconventional.\n\nThe Deputy Director walked over and handed them two microphones.\n\n\"Our two top heroes, aren't you going to say a few words?\"\n\nLu Ding took one.\n\nSeeing his serious expression, the audience thought he was about to say something profound. But when he spoke, all that came out was:\n\n\"You really made me look like a big shot.\"\n\nIn an instant, laughter and applause erupted.\n\nThen it slowly faded.\n\nLu Ding continued, \"If it weren't for Director Chu's silver tongue, I'd never have known I was so badass.\"\n\nThe laughter rose again. It wasn't that funny on its own, but Lu Ding's use of a swear word instantly made it hilarious.\n\nYan Feifan could only think that Brother Lu on stage was like a stand-up comedian.\n\nHe had closed the distance with his opening words.\n\nThen it was Bai Hemian's turn.\n\nHe mulled it over for a moment. People assumed that with his usual taciturn personality, he wouldn't have much to say.\n\nThe result was both perfectly in character and completely unexpected.\n\n\"I don't know. I just figured, he was coming, so I came too.\"\n\nCombined with his expressionless face, the words had an indescribable, deadpan quality.\n\nThe entertainment value shot through the roof.\n\nDirector Chu took back the conversation. \"You two should do stand-up comedy.\"\n\nSuddenly, someone shouted from the crowd below.\n\n\"Lu Ding, I know you're badass, I'm a fan! But I didn't expect you to write poetry too! You're being a little *too* badass, you know!\"\n\nTo this, Lu Ding replied.\n\n\"That wasn't my poem. I copied it. Maybe I'm not as badass as you think.\"\n\n\"Then copy another one! Don't make me get on my knees and beg, I'll do it in a heartbeat!!\"\n\n\"Yeah, we all want to hear it! We've never seen this side of the guy who dissected the Corpse Tai Sui! You should have worn your Civil and Martial Sleeves today to show off that you're skilled in both!\"\n\nDirector Chu, leading their enthusiasm, sided with them. \"Our Yunhai 749 has produced plenty of tough guys, but we've never had one skilled in both literary and martial arts. Lu Ding, it's up to you.\"\n\nUnable to resist the enthusiastic invitation.\n\n\"Alright, I'll say this first: it might not fit the occasion, but I like it a lot.\"\n\n\"Just recite it. They'll use their imaginations and flatter themselves by making it fit,\" Director Chu said, playing along.\n\nLu Ding took a step forward.\n\n\"This poem was written by a great man I deeply admire, and I feel it fits my own situation as well.\"\n\nLu Ding's expression turned serious.\n\n\"A child resolves to leave his hometown gate,\nVowing not to return until his name is made.\nWhy must one's bones be buried in their native soil?\nAll of life's lands are green mountains for a grave.\"\n\nThe applause was thunderous. Many people shot to their feet the moment Lu Ding finished reciting.\n\nThere was no excessive literary flourish.\n\nNor was it abstruse or difficult to understand.\n\nIts meaning was simple and clear, yet the feelings it inspired were not shallow. Every person had their own interpretation.\n\nEveryone present could see themselves in those lines.\n\nAs for Lu Ding, having transmigrated here, had he not also left his home? The moment he learned he had a golden finger, he had prepared himself for death.\n\nBecause he had to face monsters directly.\n\nSo it didn't matter where he died or where he was buried, even if it was in the belly of a monster. Everywhere was a green mountain suitable for burial; there was no need to dwell on such things.\n\nIt was the same for the other investigators. Most of them had started as ordinary people before awakening the chance to become Qi Refiners, which was also a departure from the realm of ordinary people.\n\nJoining 749 to fight monsters, some wanted to become true heroes, others sought a wider world for themselves. But whether hero or seeker of the Way, it made no difference to the monsters.\n\nThey killed and ate them all the same. So, who knew where they would die or where they would be buried?\n\nPerhaps they were happy today, only to die on a mission tomorrow, ending up in a monster's stomach.\n\nAfter Lu Ding received his award and left the stage, the remaining investigators and those from the other prefecture-level cities of Yunhai went up to receive theirs.\n\nHowever, aside from Yunhai, nothing major had happened elsewhere. After all, a Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts wasn't some common cabbage you could find everywhere.\n\nIn the front row below the stage.\n\nSeveral major figures sat in their seats.\n\n\"Those two kids are certainly outstanding, but doesn't this throw everything into chaos? Hahahaha! Who would dare compete with them for first or second place?\"\n\n\"I reckon anyone who ran into them would just surrender immediately. Anyway, if it were me in my younger days, I'd surrender the moment I saw them. No point in picking a fight you know you can't win.\"\n\n\"A Linghai-realm cultivator helped kill a Siming-realm one. Forget a one-on-one fight, even if all the kids who joined our Bureau this year teamed up, they probably couldn't beat those two working together.\"\n\n\"I hear Old Wang's side has a few impressive kids too. Why don't we have a little competition with them?\"\n\n\"Sure, why not? Our own First-Year Martial Tournament is pointless this year anyway. Those two would just crush everyone. There's no need to even hold it.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll notify them later. With our two branches combined, that's twenty prize slots, and the top six get advanced training. Looks like things are going to get lively this year.\"\n\n***\n\n¹Shi Gandang: In Chinese folklore, these are stone tablets with inscriptions placed at key locations to ward off evil spirits.

    "content": "...\n\nAfter the show let out late at night.\n\nLu Ding was in no hurry to go back.\n\nSince he was already here, he might as well take care of everything at once.\n\nHe had accumulated enough missions to be promoted to Formal Investigator. It wasn't just Lu Ding; even Yan Feifan had enough to be promoted alongside him.\n\nYan Feifan had joined earlier than Lu Ding to begin with.\n\nHe was only a few missions behind.\n\nAnd recently, he had been thoroughly carried by Lu Ding.\n\nThe only reason he hadn't been promoted to Formal Investigator was that he was afraid of the potential awkwardness if he was promoted before Brother Lu.\n\nSo he held off on filing the paperwork.\n\nAlthough Lu Ding wouldn't care about such a small thing, he, Yan Feifan, had to know how to conduct himself. It was all about social etiquette; others might not require the gesture, but you couldn't be without it.\n\nNow was the perfect time to do it together with Lu Ding.\n\nThe two filled out the forms, exchanged their old and new credentials, and upgraded their mobile phone accounts.\n\nFinally, a staff member handed over the new credentials.\n\nShe said sweetly.\n\n\"Congratulations, Investigator Lu, on your promotion to Formal Investigator.\"\n\n\"Formal Investigators have one opportunity to choose a free cultivation technique. Would you like to pick a better one for yourself?\"\n\n\"If you would, I can start the paperwork for you now, and you can go directly. If not, you will be compensated with two hundred contribution points.\"\n\n*Do Formal Investigators really eat this well?*\n\nLu Ding thought to himself.\n\nAs for updating his cultivation technique.\n\nHe felt his current one was sufficient for now.\n\nMainly, he hadn't broken through to the Divine Palace realm yet. Lu Ding's original plan was to switch to a better technique after reaching the Divine Palace realm.\n\nThat way, the ceiling would be higher, and the floor would be better too.\n\nHe was very comfortable with his current Flying Bear Pounce and Kill Technique.\n\nBesides, he was about to go for advanced training soon, where there would be many more, better choices waiting for him.\n\nHe might as well exchange it for contribution points to buy heavenly materials and earthly treasures to use in conjunction with the Grand Sui Honey from his first-class merit award.\n\nHe'd surge to the ninth level of the Spirit Sea realm in one go.\n\nThat way, he could finish the First Year Tournament in the most dominant state possible.\n\nLu Ding had no interest in playing these childish games of make-believe.\n\nThrough this period of constantly clashing and fighting with Qi Refiners of the same stage, and even those of higher cultivation levels, he had come to fully understand his position in the Qi Refiner food chain.\n\nQi Refiners of the same year were, to him, completely crushable. They posed no challenge at all. It didn't matter who it was, anyone at all, whoever the hell it was—it was all the same to him.\n\nTo put it in one sentence, he was using a cheat.\n\nAs for whether people would call him arrogant?\n\nSo what if he was?\n\nIs being arrogant against the law?\n\nIf you play the pig to eat the tiger, you'd better not actually become a pig.\n\nSince he had an advantage, he should expand it. Cultivation level was always the most reliable thing!\n\n\"Just exchange it for two hundred contribution points for me.\"\n\nLu Ding said as he pulled out his phone.\n\nHe was going on a shopping spree!\n\nSoon, Lu Ding's account balance was back to zero. Just then, Yan Feifan returned, having finished picking his new cultivation technique.\n\nHe was holding a large box.\n\nLu Ding returned to his single dorm at the 749 Bureau, while Yan Feifan went back to Baofan District.\n\nIn his words: \"Brother Lu, you just focus on cultivating. I've got everything in Baofan District covered. If there's anything I can't handle, I'll message you.\"\n\nAs a freeloader being carried by a top player, Yan Feifan deeply understood what he should be doing at what time.\n\nFor instance, right now, letting Lu Ding focus on his cultivation to face the First Year Tournament was the top priority.\n\nBack in the single dorm.\n\nHe took off his clothes and filled the bathtub with water.\n\nHe added the Grand Sui Honey from his first-class merit award, then put in the various other heavenly materials and earthly treasures he had bought with his contribution points.\n\nHe wondered if he had added too much.\n\nLooking at the bubbling bathtub, Lu Ding grew pensive.\n\n\"Last time I mixed them together to eat, nothing happened. Mixing them together for a bath this time shouldn't be a big problem, right?\"\n\nThe main thing was that the Grand Sui Honey was for external use, working from the outside in. Lu Ding had also bought many other heavenly materials and earthly treasures.\n\nHe didn't want to consume or use them one by one.\n\nSo he simply bought all external-use items, mixed them into one tub, and decided to stew himself in the iron pot.\n\nHe stepped into the tub.\n\nA surging medicinal power instantly rushed at him.\n\nIt wasn't gentle at all, directly forcing open all the acupoints in Lu Ding's body and drawing in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. For others, this degree of intensity might have been too violent, but for Lu Ding, it was the medicinal effect he had dreamed of.\n\nThis is how it should be!\n\nFlying Bear Pounce and Kill Technique, activate!\n\nAt that moment, it began to rain in Lu Ding's Spirit Sea. Countless drops of liquefied spiritual energy fell like a downpour into the sea.\n\nThe rumbling vibrations were the Spirit Sea expanding.\n\nIt stirred up monstrous waves, an apocalyptic scene.\n\nBut just then.\n\nBeneath the sky of the Spirit Sea, a giant stone tablet descended.\n\nInscribed on it were three large characters: Shi Gandang!¹\n\nIt settled firmly into the Spirit Sea, and in an instant, the wind and waves calmed.\n\nThis saved Lu Ding a great deal of unnecessary effort.\n\nHis realm began to soar.\n\nSixth Level of the Spirit Sea, Seventh Level of the Spirit Sea, Eighth Level of the Spirit Sea...\n\nWhile Lu Ding was cultivating these past few days.\n\nBaofan District was peaceful and quiet, but a piece of news from the 749 Bureau caused a sensation.\n\nThe original First Year Tournament had been changed to a joint tournament between the three major southern districts: Yunhai, Yaodu, and Qing Province.\n\nInitially, the leaders of the Yunhai 749 Bureau had just wanted to have a friendly competition with Yaodu. But then Qing Province complained, asking why they weren't included, claiming they had impressive newcomers as well.\n\nThe result of this fuss was that all three bureaus would hold the First Year Tournament together.\n\nThirty spots, with the top nine advancing to receive advanced training.\n\nWith this, the new investigators from all three major districts were howling with excitement.\n\nThe fairly decent new investigators thought, *I might not be able to snag a spot for advanced training, but I can at least make it into the top thirty, right?*\n\nThe excellent new investigators thought, *I wasn't too confident competing against the others in my own district since the spots were so few. Now there are nine spots. It's not too much to ask for me to take one, right?*\n\nNo one thought they were weak. It was just that the other new investigators in their own districts were no pushovers, so it wasn't a sure thing.\n\nNow with the three districts collaborating, the number of spots increased. Although the number of participants also increased, in their hearts, they all thought the new investigators from the other two districts were Muggles.\n\nSnagging a spot would be as easy as turning over their hand.\n\nAnd so, the three-district joint event was set to be held at the Yunhai 749 Bureau. After all, Yunhai had proposed it first, and Yunhai was also centrally located.\n\nEveryone knew Yunhai was rich and powerful, with deep pockets, and wouldn't feel the sting if some things got broken.\n\nSo it would be held in Yunhai.\n\nJust like that.\n\nA few days later, investigators from the Yaodu 749 Bureau and Qing Province 749 Bureau gathered in Yunhai.\n\nCaojia Lane in Baofan District became exceptionally lively.\n\nEver since Cao Ying took over Caojia Lane, he had brought the channel for Treasure-Sensing Mountain Wares to the area.\n\nHis years of trekking through the mountains had not been for nothing.\n\nAt his command.\n\nCaojia Lane became the hottest place to sell goods in Yunhai at that moment.\n\nThis was also why Cao Ying had been so insistent on returning.\n\nHe could make money.\n\nNow, he was raking it in every day, no longer needing to cross mountains and ridges.\n\nToday was a good day for Caojia Lane to sell its wares, timed with the three-district collaboration.\n\nAt a stall selling mountain treasures.\n\nXie Shunan was on a shopping spree.\n\nDuring this time, she had spent a lot of effort but had yet to find any particularly good heavenly materials or earthly treasures.\n\nIt just so happened that Caojia Lane was selling a large number of mountain treasures today, so she came to take a look.\n\nPreparing an apology gift for Lu Ding was one reason. Using her connection of being on speaking terms with Lu Ding, she had secured her position as the heir to the Sihai Group. Buying benefits for the Qi Refiner employees under the Sihai Group to win their loyalty was the second reason.\n\nSo today, Xie Shunan needed to buy a lot, and she needed to buy good quality.\n\nAfter nearly buying out another mountain wares stall and looking at the few remaining items, the stall owner said, \"Boss, you're so generous. I'll give you the rest of these things for free.\"\n\nLooking at the remaining few ordinary items.\n\nXie Shunan wasn't interested at first, but now that they were free, it would be a waste not to take them.\n\n\"Pack them up.\"\n\nThe words had barely left her mouth when she heard.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\"\n\nChen Xian strode forward and pressed a hand on the tree knot the owner was giving away. \"This thing is a freebie anyway. How about selling it to me?\"\n\nAs they say, no merchant is without cunning. Xie Shunan immediately sensed something was off. She hadn't even given this item a second glance, yet this man was rushing to buy it.\n\nCould it be some treasure she had overlooked?\n\nShe had already bought so much, one more wouldn't matter. Rather than gambling on an uncertainty, it was better to hold it in her hands, take it back, and examine it slowly. If it turned out to be something good, it would be perfect as an apology gift for Patrol Inspector Lu, and also as a thank you.\n\n\"Not for sale.\"\n\nXie Shunan refused directly. The bodyguard behind her stepped forward to take the tree knot.\n\nChen Xian raised a hand to stop him.\n\n\"Name your price. I sincerely want to buy it. I won't hide it from you. This thing is called an Yi Wood Knot. It's rare, yes, but it offers no help whatsoever to one's cultivation.\"\n\n\"It has one and only one use: to suppress corpse qi. It's useless to you. Why not sell it to me? I need it to save someone.\"\n\n*Rare?*\n\nHearing that word, Xie Shunan's eyes lit up.\n\nRare was exactly what she wanted. As far as she knew, after the 749 Bureau's First Year Tournament, with Lu Ding's strength, he would definitely be sent for advanced training and probably wouldn't be back for a while.\n\nHer gift had to be delivered before Lu Ding left.\n\nAlthough she didn't have anything particularly good, adding a rare item as a bonus would work too.\n\nXie Shunan couldn't be bothered to waste words with him. \"Where are the people who maintain order in Caojia Lane? Someone's trying to rob me.\"\n\nAs soon as she said this, several Qi Refiners from Caojia Lane immediately surrounded them.\n\nIt was normal for the highest bidder to get a good item, but shouting about robbery changed the nature of the situation entirely. This was causing trouble.\n\n\"I'm not robbing anyone! I really need it to save someone's life! It's useless to you, so what's the harm in letting me have it? I'm even willing to pay! There's a girl suffering from corpse qi, she's in great pain, she needs this thing!?\"\n\n\"Or do you want more? Name your price. Five million, ten million, I can accept it.\"\n\nXie Shunan looked at him. \"So what does that have to do with me? Did I cause the corpse qi? Since this thing is mine now, I have the right to decide what to do with it.\"\n\n\"Don't try to guilt-trip me. As for the girl you mentioned, her suffering was not caused by me. And I couldn't care less about the 'ten million' you speak of.\"\n\nTen million?\n\nSaying that was simply an insult to her.\n\nThe gunny sacks held by the two bodyguards behind her were filled with various mountain wares and treasures worth several tens of millions.\n\n\"Alright, she already said it's not for sale. Just give it back. You're a guest here, don't make things difficult for us. Otherwise, we'll have to get rough.\"\n\nOne of the Caojia Lane Qi Refiners spoke up.\n\nChen Xian raised his hand, displaying his Yaodu 749 Bureau credentials.\n\n\"So, you're going to use force against a 749 Bureau Investigator!?\"\n\nXie Shunan frowned. *Again?*\n\n*Fine!*\n\n*I'll message Lu Ding. You just wait.*\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ Shi Gandang (石敢當): Literally \"Stone Dares to Withstand.\" In Chinese culture, these are inscribed stone tablets placed in key locations to ward off evil spirits and negative influences.",

    "content": "......\n\nHe flashed his credentials.\n\nThe people of Cao Family Alley were unmoved.\n\nTheir attitude remained the same. When others came to Cao Family Alley to sell or buy goods, they were responsible for order and the rules.\n\nBesides, they hadn't done anything reckless. They were just handling matters according to the law and regulations, protecting their own rights and interests.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, but even if you're an investigator from 749, you still have to follow the rules, don't you? The item belongs to someone else. Are you trying to take it by force?\"\n\n\"If you intend to take it by force, then we will fight to the death to stop you. If we die, our families will be provided for by the Chief.\"\n\n\"We will do our utmost.\"\n\n\"But you might run into some trouble. To minimize losses and avoid unnecessary conflict, I must remind you that Cao Family Alley is under the jurisdiction of Baofan District, the territory of the Corpse-Dissolving Grand Marshal, Lu Ding, Patrol Officer Lu.\"\n\n\"Grand Marshal Lu doesn't have a very good temper. If you break the rules here, you'll probably have to be carried out of Baofan District horizontally.\"\n\nChen Xian's expression darkened. What was the deal with the cultivators of Baofan District?\n\nWere they not going to give him any face at all?\n\nAnd every single one of them had such a tough attitude.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with courtesy before force, but their 'force' was immediately a matter of life and death.\n\nThey were making it perfectly clear: since you won't listen, if we're going to fight, we fight to the death. You're not taking that item unless you kill us today.\n\nBut if he really killed these people, he would probably be punished severely.\n\nBut if he didn't fight, he truly wasn't getting out of here today.\n\nAnd who was this Lu Ding anyway? Was his temper really that bad?\n\nAlthough he didn't say it out loud, he was a bit of a skeptic deep down.\n\nChen Xian set the item down. The crowd thought he was backing off, giving everyone a way to save face.\n\nBut then.\n\nChen Xian circulated the Qi in his body and pushed out with both hands.\n\n\"You have your principles, and I have mine! Chen Xian of Yaodu 749, I await your instruction!\"\n\nHe had to take the item!\n\nSince the soft approach didn't work, it was time for the hard one.\n\nWorst-case scenario, he just wouldn't kill anyone.\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nYunhai 749 employee dormitory.\n\nHaving finished washing up, Lu Ding was looking at an announcement on the 749 app.\n\nHe was now a cultivator at the ninth level of the Spirit Sea realm. Thanks to the Grand Marshal Honey, various heavenly materials and earthly treasures, and the amplification from Unity of Heaven and Man, his cultivation level had shot up from the fifth level of the Spirit Sea to the ninth in just three days.\n\nThis was the cultivation talent of a prodigy, a level even higher than a genius.\n\nUsing the fewest heavenly materials to advance the most levels and gain the highest combat power.\n\nA true genius wasn't someone who took a pile of heavenly materials and ultimate techniques only to achieve what an ordinary person could.\n\nA true genius was someone who could accomplish things far beyond an ordinary person, even with the simplest of arts and average heavenly materials.\n\n*That* was a genius.\n\nOnly by reaching this level could a genius truly stand out from the crowd. They would have the skill and the confidence to obtain more and better heavenly materials and ultimate techniques, eventually snowballing their power.\n\nThis is a genius.\n\nAfter he finished reading the announcement.\n\nLu Ding put down his phone. The Primordial Year Martial Tournament, which he had initially found dull, suddenly seemed a bit more interesting.\n\nNever mind him now; even before, his colleagues from Yunhai 749 probably wouldn't have had any will to fight if they met him in the ring.\n\nIt was practically a given that Lu Ding would climb to the top uncontested.\n\nHe wouldn't even need to fight to get one of the advanced training slots.\n\nThe others would only dream of second place and fight over third.\n\nBut now things were different. A joint event between three districts, with thirty prize slots, the top nine of which were for advanced training.\n\nThey were all cultivators. Who would admit someone else was stronger without seeing it with their own eyes?\n\nEspecially when they were all from the same year.\n\nTherefore, Lu Ding was certain that whether it was Yunhai 749, Yaodu 749, or Qingsheng, they would all think the investigators from the other two branches were scrubs.\n\nCompeting for ten slots would be like a thousand soldiers crossing a single-plank bridge—they might find it difficult. But now there were thirty slots.\n\nThe top nine for advanced training.\n\nThe number of slots had increased, and although the number of people had also increased, the latter was almost negligible in everyone's mind.\n\nWhen the time came, Lu Ding would also have a chance to stretch his legs.\n\nBecause someone, not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth, would inevitably come to fight him.\n\nLike, for instance, the genius investigators from the other two districts.\n\nThat was a certainty.\n\nAt this thought, Lu Ding's mood improved. He could go beat up some newbies again.\n\n\"Since I'm in such a good mood today, I'll ask Bai Hemian and Yan Feifan to go get hotpot.\"\n\nLu Ding held his phone.\n\nHe had just sent a message to the two of them.\n\nBai Hemian said he was going to the parking lot to get the car.\n\nYan Feifan said he was coming to pick Lu Ding up.\n\nBefore Lu Ding could reply...\n\nA message came from Jie Shunan, detailing the earlier incident. Seeing the contents, Lu Ding's mood instantly soured.\n\nA Yaodu 749 investigator was strong-arming a sale in Baofan District.\n\nAnd had already started a fight with the people in Cao Family Alley.\n\nLu Ding really didn't get it. Why was it that every time he was in a good mood, someone just had to come looking for trouble?\n\nYou, a 749 investigator, pulling a strong-arm sale.\n\nYou really haven't learned a thing about rules and law, have you? Truly lawless, to dare pull something like this in his jurisdiction.\n\nLu Ding stood up.\n\nHe sent a reply to Yan Feifan and Bai Hemian.\n\n【No need to pick me up. Let's meet at Cao Family Alley. Someone's causing trouble there, I'm flying straight over.】\n\n【Bai Hemian: Wanna race?】\n\n【Lu Ding: Sure. I'll give you a head start with your *dùnshù*¹. I'm putting on my shoes.】\n\nAs soon as that message went out, from the 749 base, a black shadow instantly shot into the distance.\n\nFrom the Baofan District Public Security Bureau, a vehicle roared out.\n\nAnd Lu Ding, unhurriedly putting on his shoes, stood on his windowsill and soared into the sky.\n\nThe scenery on the ground blurred.\n\nBefore long, he had already caught up to Bai Hemian, sensing his aura rapidly moving below ground.\n\nLu Ding smiled. \"You're still too slow.\"\n\nPropelled by his spiritual Qi, his speed jumped another notch.\n\n***\n\nCao Family Alley.\n\nOn the ground lay a number of cultivators from Cao Family Alley.\n\nChen Xian, his aura imposing, roared, \"Don't force my hand!!!!\"\n\nCao Ying, activating his magical artifact, shot back, \"Force your hand? A transaction is when you're willing to buy and she's willing to sell. That's a transaction! You want to buy, but if the other person doesn't want to sell, you just take it by force?\"\n\n\"And that's us forcing *your* hand!!?\"\n\n\"What kind of fucking logic is that?\"\n\n\"Cao Family Alley provides a channel and maintains order. You come here and use force to rob someone, and when we do our job to stop you, that's 'forcing your hand'!!? You're a real piece of work, twisting things to your advantage.\"\n\n\"That's just sophistry!!\"\n\n\"This Yimu Knot² is useless to you people anyway! What's wrong with selling it to me? It's not like I'm not paying.\"\n\nChen Xian shouted, fully aware of what he was doing.\n\nEveryone present knew what he was doing too.\n\nBut if you called him out for robbing them, then *you* were the one in the wrong.\n\nBecause he was going to pay; he just didn't care one bit whether the other party wanted to sell or not.\n\n\"Damn it, do you really not understand human language? She said she doesn't want to sell!!!\"\n\nAs Cao Ying flared up, one of the fallen Cao Family Alley cultivators suddenly leaped up and grabbed Chen Xian's leg.\n\n\"Quick! Chief, I've got him!\"\n\nCao Ying immediately activated his artifact to press the attack again.\n\n\"You forced me to do this.\"\n\nThe spiritual Qi around Chen Xian's body exploded, sending the cultivator flying and spitting blood in mid-air.\n\nHe spread his hands before him in a ready stance.\n\nA phantom image of a savage bull solidified behind him.\n\nJust then, a figure descended from the sky. A foot stomped down, and the savage bull phantom shattered instantly.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Dùnshù* (遁術) refers to various high-speed movement or escape arts, often associated with the elements (e.g., earth, water, fire).\n² Yimu Knot (乙木結): *Yǐmù* refers to the Yin Wood element in the traditional Chinese system of Heavenly Stems. *Jié* means knot.",

Lu Ding truly didn't want to waste any more time commenting on it.\n\nFeeling the spiritual qi in his body completely impossible to summon, suppressed from all sides, fresh blood trickled from the corner of Chen Xian's mouth.\n\nHe forced down the blood rising in his throat and explained, \"It's not like that, listen to my explanation...\"\n\nLu Ding switched legs and sent a soccer kick his way, knocking the words right back into Chen Xian's chest and the blood back into his throat.\n\nThe pain left him unable to utter a single word.\n\n\"Just shut up.\"\n\n\"If you really wanted to explain, what the fuck were you doing earlier? Someone else might listen to you explain, but that person won't be me.\"\n\nWhen they think they can win, it's \"Don't force my hand.\" When they know they can't, it's \"Please, listen to my explanation, it's all a misunderstanding.\"\n\nBy that logic, there would be far too many \"misunderstandings\" in the world.\n\nLu Ding wasn't blind, and the surrounding surveillance cameras weren't just for decoration.\n\nFurthermore, the Four Seas Group that Xie Shunan belonged to had been established in the Baofan District for many years.\n\nWould she dare to play tricks and deceive Lu Ding?\n\nIf she did dare to play such tricks, the consequences would be more than she could bear.\n\nAt the same time.\n\nFrom within the crowd, a figure flickered and appeared out of thin air at the very front.\n\n\"Investigator, to not even let a man speak, isn't that a bit too tyrannical? Or is this the way you from Yunhai 749 show your hospitality?\"\n\nLu Ding looked over.\n\nThe newcomer wore a standard-issue 749 combat uniform, her hair in a high ponytail. With a blade at her waist and the epaulet on her shoulder, she was clearly an investigator from Yaodu 749.\n\n\"The last person who liked to meddle in things regardless of the situation already had their mouth torn off by me. You want to give it a try?\"\n\nShangguan Qing's expression turned frosty.\n\nJust a moment ago, she had been on the other side of Cao Family Alley, selecting heavenly materials and earthly treasures. Then she heard that a Yaodu 749 investigator was causing trouble over here.\n\nThinking that while they were away from home, she couldn't let one bad apple spoil the reputation of Yaodu 749, she decided to come over and handle the situation.\n\nBut who knew that as soon as she arrived, she would see Lu Ding with his foot on Chen Xian, not even allowing him to speak.\n\nShe and Chen Xian were what you could call friends, and besides, Chen Xian was also a Yaodu 749 investigator.\n\nFor both personal and professional reasons, she felt Chen Xian did not deserve this kind of treatment.\n\nSo she stepped forward and said what she did.\n\nAnd now, Lu Ding had this kind of attitude.\n\nShangguan Qing was finding it hard to bear. After all, she was one of Yaodu 749's genius investigators; of course she had a temper.\n\n\"Regardless, Chen Xian is still an investigator from Yaodu 749. If he is truly at fault, Yaodu 749 will be the one to punish him. It is not your place to take action.\"\n\n\"And besides, speaking to me like that... am I to assume you're provoking me!?\"\n\nChen Xian, still pinned under Lu Ding's foot, watched as Shangguan Qing's aura flared.\n\nHe felt in his heart that the grievances he'd suffered today were worth it.\n\nThat's right. His attempt to forcibly buy the Yimu Knot had been for Shangguan Qing's sake.\n\nNow that the very person he'd done it for had appeared to seek \"justice\" on his behalf, he was deeply moved.\n\nBut this was not the time to be moved.\n\nAlthough Shangguan Qing was very powerful, he could sense that the man suppressing him was even stronger—he had to be a veteran investigator from Yunhai 749.\n\nShangguan Qing was definitely not his match.\n\nNo wonder the people of Cao Family Alley were so fearless.\n\nHe struggled desperately to shake his head, to speak, but Lu Ding's spiritual qi was pressing down on him so hard that he couldn't make a sound.\n\nA black shadow streaked in from the distance.\n\nAnd materialized behind Shangguan Qing.\n\n\"Seventh-level Spirit Sea... how do you have the guts to talk to him like that?\"\n\nAs Bai Hemian's voice sounded, Shangguan Qing felt as if a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood had materialized behind her. It even caused the corpse qi within her own body to stir restlessly.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, she spun around, twisting at the waist to deliver a palm strike, using the full momentum of her body to generate force.\n\nTo meet her attack, Bai Hemian simply raised a hand casually.\n\nBANG!!!\n\nTheir palms met, and a shockwave rolled out.\n\nBai Hemian remained expressionless, but blood trickled from the corner of Shangguan Qing's mouth. A surge of spiritual qi laced with corpse qi had invaded her body, throwing her own qi circulation into chaos.\n\nFinally, it triggered the residual corpse qi within her.\n\nHer aura instantly withered, and she staggered backward.\n\nSeeing her condition, Bai Hemian frowned and looked around.\n\nHis expression seemed to say, *I didn't expect her seventh-level Spirit Sea cultivation to be so watered-down. I didn't even do anything to her. She hit me, I blocked, and she coughed up blood.*\n\nEighth-level Spirit Sea!!\n\nShangguan Qing thought in shock. She hadn't expected that a randomly appearing investigator would have an eighth-level Spirit Sea cultivation.\n\nAnd not just any ordinary eighth-level Spirit Sea, at that.\n\nAs the saying goes, it only takes one move to know if someone's an expert.\n\nFrom that single exchange, Shangguan Qing knew she was absolutely no match for Bai Hemian.\n\nLeaving aside his spiritual qi, which was laced with corpse qi, the sheer quality of his qi alone surpassed hers.\n\nSo.....\n\nIn an instant, her gaze shifted to Lu Ding.\n\n*I can't beat him, but don't tell me I can't beat you?*\n\nTwisting her body like an agile cheetah, she pushed her flexibility to its absolute limit and lunged violently at Lu Ding.\n\nThe crowd watched with amused gazes.\n\nTheir eyes filled with ridicule.\n\nMost of the people present were Qi Refiners from the Yunhai vicinity, or from Cao Family Alley itself.\n\nThey knew exactly how much weight the name Lu Ding carried; they had been hearing tales of him ever since he first made a name for himself.\n\nHow... did she dare?\n\nUnable to beat Bai Hemian, she turned around and went after Lu Ding.\n\n*Did she feel that losing to Bai Hemian wasn't clean enough, so she wanted to experience a swift, one-move defeat instead?*\n\nLu Ding watched her charge at him.\n\nObserving her peculiar method of generating force, Lu Ding casually swung his arm.\n\nSeeing that he was trying to imitate her, Shangguan Qing thought he must have a screw loose. *A secret, master's technique for generating force—do you think you can learn it just by trying it out a few times?*\n\nFlipping her body, she lashed out with her leg in mid-air like a whip, the tip of her foot creating a sonic boom as it flew toward Lu Ding.\n\n\"You want to learn? Then experience it firsthand!!!\"\n\nEyes glanced their way.\n\nLu Ding swung his arm as if it were boneless. He raised his hand and lashed out. The sonic boom was louder, the force greater, the speed faster, and the control was precise to the absolute extreme.\n\nCRACK!!!!\n\nSomeone was sent flying. The clothing from her collarbone down her back instantly shredded, but there was no glimpse of the snow-white skin so often described in novels.\n\nThere was only a swathe of crimson, tinged with deep purple from the blood pooling beneath.\n\nThe pain of the whip-like strike nearly made Shangguan Qing pass out.\n\nBut compared to the pain in her flesh, the feeling of her pride being utterly shattered was far more agonizing.\n\nHer burning back was a constant reminder.\n\n*That something you spent so long to barely grasp, he could master it to a greater degree than you with just a single look.*\n\nThen, Lu Ding's next words made her so furious that blood rushed to her head, clouding her consciousness.\n\n\"Using softness to overcome hardness—an excellent concept. But your execution of it is a complete mess.\"\n\nThe corpse qi in her body, already agitated by Bai Hemian, was taking its toll. Now, with Lu Ding's comment...\n\nShe was overcome with rage.\n\nShangguan Qing fainted dead away, falling stiffly to the ground.\n\nSeeing this, Chen Xian mustered all his spiritual qi, bursting with 120 percent of his potential. At last, under Lu Ding's suppression, he managed to feebly stretch a hand toward the fallen Shangguan Qing.\n\nAnd then he heard that voice again.\n\n\"Oh, right. I forgot about you.\"\n\nTHUD!!\n\nPain flooded his senses, and Chen Xian's personal display screen instantly disconnected, plunging into darkness.",

    "content": "The newly arrived Yan Feifan wasted no time, pulling out his phone to perform a face scan.\n\nHe stood up. \"Brother Lu, this is Chen Xian, an official investigator from Yaodu 749, and Shangguan Qing, also an official investigator from Yaodu 749.\"\n\n\"They're both investigators with less than a year of experience, here for the Three-District Martial Arts Tournament. And it looks like they're so-called 'seed players'—two of Yaodu's strongest newcomers.\"\n\n\"Shangguan Qing, in particular, is the hot favorite from Yaodu to win it all.\"\n\nSeed players?\n\nYan Feifan hadn't bothered to lower his voice.\n\nThe area was packed with clusters of Qi refiners.\n\nWhen the others heard that these two were supposedly Yaodu's seed players, someone couldn't help but burst out laughing.\n\nCountless eyes swept over Lu Ding and Bai Heming. If *these two* were seed players, then what did that make their own Corpse-Solving Tai Sui, Inspector Lu, and this Investigator Bai of Many Pagodas¹...\n\n\"They're seeds, all right, but faced with Tai Sui Lu and Bai Futu², who've already grown into towering trees, they're just too green,\" Cao Ying joked from the side.\n\n\"Ignore them. Cuff them and have someone take them back to the bureau. Head Cao, remember to tally up the damages and make them pay for it.\"\n\nWith that, Lu Ding looked over at the most seriously injured Qi refiner from Cao Family Alley.\n\n\"Brother, how are your injuries?\"\n\nThe man was touched. \"I'm fine, Tai Sui Lu. Just coughed up a little blood. I'll be fine after some rest.\"\n\n\"Go back and rest up. I'll get you the medical fees.\"\n\nHearing Lu Ding's words, the man glanced at the peacefully sleeping Chen Xian on the ground.\n\nLu Ding added, \"Don't worry, *he* won't be paying the medical fees. He started the trouble, broke the rules, and refused to listen to reason. He deserves what he got.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Tai Sui Lu.\"\n\nSomeone came over and helped the man away.\n\nXie Shunan picked up the slightly battered Yi Wood Knot from the ground and came forward.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Tai Sui Lu. I don't know why I always run into this kind of trouble. This is the item I told you about.\"\n\n\"I think it's called a Yi Wood Knot. I heard it can suppress corpse qi. It's very precious. That investigator from Yaodu 749 wanted it.\"\n\nLu Ding took it and examined it. It didn't look particularly special, about the same as any other heavenly material or earthly treasure.\n\nYan Feifan's fingers were already flying across an app, looking it up.\n\nBefore he could read the results aloud, Bai Heming spoke. \"Could I have that? I can pay with money, heavenly materials, or even a cultivation technique. I can't trade the ones I learned from 749, but I can offer ones I own personally.\"\n\nXie Shunan looked over at him.\n\nHow to put it... his words were very refreshing to hear.\n\nTo her, money was really no different from just a number. It was the other things she truly desired. If only that Chen Xian hadn't tried to fob her off with money.\n\nIf he had just said he could trade a precious heavenly material for it, Xie Shunan would have considered it.\n\nBut that guy clearly saw her buy out an entire stall, and his first offer was ten million. Who was he trying to insult with words like that?\n\n\"I'm sorry, Investigator Bai, but I wanted to give this to Inspector Lu. You...\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Lu Ding tossed the Yi Wood Knot in his hand to Bai Heming.\n\n\"You gave me that outfit last time. Consider this a gift in return.\"\n\nAlthough he didn't know what Bai Heming needed it for, if he wanted it, he could have it. There was no need for so many questions. The thing was useless to him anyway; he didn't need to suppress any corpse qi.\n\nBai Heming secured the Yi Wood Knot. This item was of great use to him. Shangguan Qing was merely plagued by lingering corpse qi.\n\nHe, on the other hand, was half-human and half-corpse, born of a mother-corpse at the turn of the year on a day thick with yin energy—all the negative buffs stacked to the max. Coupled with the punishment he received for killing a teammate in the past, the fact that Bai Heming was still alive was a testament to his immense effort.\n\nWith the matter resolved, Yan Feifan began dispersing the crowd.\n\nCao Ying sidled over.\n\n\"Brother Lu, I got my hands on another Raging Sun Chicken. The moment you showed off your divine might, I sent a message to have them kill and stew one.\"\n\n\"You know my boys, always in and out of the mountains and forests. They can be heavy-handed and might've added too much salt. How about you all come and help me check if it's too salty?\"\n\nThey had originally planned to get hotpot.\n\nBut now Cao Ying was inviting them.\n\nLu Ding still felt he hadn't had nearly enough of that Raging Sun Chicken from last time.\n\nHe looked at Bai Heming and Yan Feifan. \"Well then, shall we go help our great Head Cao test the saltiness?\"\n\nThe group all laughed and went together.\n\nThis time, Xie Shunan didn't refuse.\n\n***\n\nTime flew, and night fell.\n\nIn a cell at the Yunhai 749 bureau, Shangguan Qing was the first to wake. Sitting in the cold cell, she felt a little dazed, her mind replaying the scene of their earlier fight.\n\nLu Ding had crushed her with pure technique.\n\nThe physical pain, having been treated while she was unconscious, had mostly subsided, but the blow to her spirit was indelible.\n\nShangguan Qing continuously tried to rationalize it to herself.\n\n\"An ordinary Divine Palace Realm Qi refiner shouldn't be that strong, right...?\"\n\nIf Bai Heming's victory was due to a trick involving his corpse qi, then Lu Ding had defeated her in her own area of expertise, using something he learned in a moment to overcome her years of hard work.\n\nHow could Shangguan Qing not be devastated?\n\nShe thought of the insignia on Lu Ding's shoulder. Then she remembered how, when Lu Ding made his move, not a single person in the crowd dared to speak up or cause a fuss. It had been absurdly quiet.\n\nThat kind of prestige and power... He must be a senior official investigator, right? He must be incredibly powerful himself, and with his great talent, that's why he could learn in a moment what took her so long to master.\n\nIt was the principle of \"mastery of one leads to mastery of all.\" When one's cultivation level rises, so does one's understanding. It's a top-down process, not bottom-up.\n\nIf I had the same amount of time to cultivate as him, I could definitely surpass him! I'm sure of it!\n\nI'll do well in the assessment tomorrow, take first place in the three districts to qualify for advanced training, and when I come back, I'll challenge him!\n\nAs for how Shangguan Qing arrived at such a conclusion:\n\nShangguan Qing, twenty years old, had been with 749 for ten months. She had advanced from Aperture Opening to the seventh level of the Spirit Sea Realm, fought countless battles, and had endless fortuitous encounters.\n\nTo this day, the title of \"genius\" had followed her everywhere. Her peers among the investigators saw her as a god.\n\nEvery leader in the bureau praised her as a genius.\n\nAnd she had both talent and diligence.\n\nThe collision of the innate and the acquired was bound to create a different kind of spark.\n\nShangguan Qing had been raised in just such an environment.\n\nBesides, she had fought against powerful experts before. Some of them displayed the raw power of a higher realm. Others revealed profound cultivation techniques with an innate air of majesty.\n\nNo one had ever defeated her in such a way. Ever!\n\nAnd on top of that, Lu Ding had said her practice was a complete mess, which was like grinding her pride into the dirt.\n\nThat was why she had imagined Lu Ding to be a powerful, senior investigator, never once considering that he might be a newly promoted rookie.\n\nAs for her so-called talent and technique?\n\nLu Ding could achieve a state of oneness with Heaven and Earth, blessed by the world itself. She wanted to compare her skills to *that*?\n\nWhat's this \"your technique, my technique\" nonsense? If he sees it, it becomes his technique.\n\nGimme that.\n\nBut what if he *was* a new investigator?\n\nThe thought flickered through Shangguan Qing's mind for an instant—after all, Lu Ding looked so young.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Investigator Bai of Many Pagodas (几经浮屠白调查员):** The original, `jǐ jīng fú tú`, literally means \"having passed through the pagoda/stupa several times.\" A `fútú` (浮屠) is a Buddhist pagoda, often associated with spiritual trials, death, and rebirth. This nickname hints at Bai Heming's nature as someone who has repeatedly brushed with or overcome death.\n2.  **Bai Futu (白浮屠):** A shorter version of the nickname above, used informally by characters who know him.",

    "content": "...\n\nBefore she could think it through.\n\nA coughing sound rang out.\n\n\"Cough, cough, cough, cough...\"\n\nClotted blood spilled from his throat, and Chen Xian felt his whole body ache.\n\nFortunately, his external wounds and bones had already been treated.\n\nHe opened his eyes and saw Shangguan Qing looking at him. Just as he was about to explain, before he could even speak, a cold snort echoed in the cell. \"You're both awake. Why not sleep a little longer?\"\n\nLooking at the middle-aged man standing outside the cell.\n\nThe two of them called out in unison, \"Instructor Feng.\"\n\n\"Are you here to save us?\" That was Chen Xian.\n\nIt would have been better if he hadn't said that. The moment he did, he was met with a torrent of curses.\n\n\"Save you? How dare you ask me to save you? As a 749 Investigator, you knowingly broke the law, robbing someone and forcing a sale in broad daylight. And the other one, without understanding the situation, rashly attacked the patrol officers of another jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"Where's your sense of shame?! Where did it go? I'm embarrassed for you.\"\n\n\"Did you not learn a single word from the Bureau's training?\"\n\nSeeing him put on such a show of scolding.\n\nLi Xuanlong, standing beside him, sneered, \"What the hell kind of act are you putting on for me? Huh? Scolding them for my benefit? Trying to pull this 'minor punishment as a major lesson' charade?\"\n\n\"Feng, let me tell you, that trick won't work. Robbing someone in broad daylight? What, is 749 a den of bandits that specializes in training thugs!?\"\n\n\"The reports and surveillance footage from my subordinates have already been submitted.\"\n\nSuch was Yan Feifan's speed.\n\n\"I won't beat around the bush with you. The principal offender remains in custody and is disqualified from tomorrow's First-Year Tournament of Arms. This person has character issues. Don't even try to push it. The surveillance footage caught everything from start to finish. He was the one forcing the other party to sell, and he wouldn't take no for an answer. This wasn't even about the highest bidder; this was a goddamn mugging.\"\n\nInstructor Feng tried to say something, but Li Xuanlong cut him off directly. \"Then, after the First-Year Tournament of Arms is over, you take him back yourselves and deal with him however you see fit. I want to see a report.\"\n\n\"The Tri-District Tournament is being watched by all the external Qi Refiners. For something like this to happen now, there must be a severe punishment.\"\n\n\"As for the accomplice, the footage shows it was a verbal dispute, and her actions were in defense of her fellow investigator, not participation in the forced sale. Therefore, the punishment will be reduced accordingly. She can still participate in tomorrow's First-Year Tournament of Arms, but when you go back, I expect to see a disciplinary notice!!\"\n\nAt this, Li Xuanlong looked into the cell, his tone icy. \"Lawless. Abusing your authority like this...¹ It's really been an eye-opener for me. I had no idea a 749 badge could be used like that.\"\n\nHaving said all this, Li Xuanlong couldn't be bothered with them anymore and turned to leave.\n\nInstructor Feng hurried after him, calling out, \"Old Li,\" \"Old Li,\" \"Hey, let's discuss this some more!\"\n\nIn the cell.\n\nChen Xian and Shangguan Qing both looked despondent.\n\nThey felt ashamed; they had brought their disgrace all the way to Yunhai.\n\nChen Xian understood clearly that this whole mess was because of his impulsiveness. Thinking back now, there were definitely better ways to handle it.\n\nBut!!\n\nIf that person had just given him a chance to explain, things absolutely would not have escalated to this point.\n\nAnd he had dragged Shangguan Qing into it, getting her punished too.\n\nHe had even lost his spot in the First-Year Tournament of Arms!\n\n\"On what grounds?\" Chen Xian just wanted to ask, on what grounds? He felt it was unfair. Yes, he had made a mistake, but couldn't they be a little flexible?\n\nHe admitted he'd been too rash, but he hadn't caused any real losses! As for the injured Qi Refiners, they were the ones who insisted on blocking him.\n\nHe could compensate them.\n\nWhy did things have to be pushed this far!?\n\nHe wouldn't accept it. Chen Xian was utterly unwilling to accept it.\n\n*Lu Ding, is it?*\n\n*I'll remember you. When I get out, we'll meet again.*\n\n*And when we do, I will repay today's humiliation a hundred times over.*\n\nAs the thought arose, in a small courtyard in Cao Family Lane, fragrant aromas filled the air. Several people were gathered around a table laden with fine wine and good food.\n\nLu Ding led the way. He had just picked up a piece of chicken and was bringing it to his mouth when, suddenly, his chopstick snapped. The chicken fell onto the table.\n\nThe lively atmosphere instantly fell silent.\n\nCao Ying looked embarrassed. Having a guest's chopsticks break during a meal was not a very auspicious sign...\n\nChopsticks, having been passed down for millennia, are the subject of many beliefs.\n\nThere is a folk magic practice known as *Yansheng*,² which uses chopsticks to warn off troublesome minor ghosts and demons.\n\nYoung children are most susceptible to harassment by evil spirits. When they are ill for a long time but checkups reveal nothing wrong, at most you'll be told they've \"had a fright.\"\n\nAt such times, an elder in the family will fill a bowl with clear water, take three commonly used chopsticks, dip them in the water, and circle them over the child's head. Then, they will try to stand the chopsticks upright in the bowl, supporting them with their hand.\n\nThe elder must call out the names of deceased relatives, in case they have returned out of longing for the child.\n\nIf the chopsticks stand, it means a relative has come back. If they don't, it might be something the child attracted from outside. They then call out the four cardinal directions: east, south, west, north.\n\nOnce they call out the correct direction, the chopsticks will stand firm, confirming that's where the trouble came from.\n\nThey first try to reason with it. If the chopsticks don't fall, they start cursing, as foully as they can. If the chopsticks still don't fall, they will grab a kitchen knife and chop them in one stroke.\n\nAfter that, the child is usually fine.\n\nIf one insisted that the chopsticks stand simply because they are wet, that could also be an explanation.\n\nBut clearly, Lu Ding currently believed in the former explanation. As the saying goes: it's better to believe it exists than to believe it doesn't.\n\nHe carefully thought back on his recent enemies.\n\nIt seemed he had put them all firmly in their place.\n\nSeeing the thoughtful look in his eyes, Yan Feifan spoke up, \"Brother Lu, that's not a good omen. Could it be Great Black Mountain?\"\n\nLu Ding shook his head. \"Unlikely.\"\n\n\"This is the Tri-District Tournament. If Great Black Mountain chose to stir up trouble now, they'd be asking for death.\"\n\n\"And if they wanted to backstab me, they wouldn't just be cursing me today. So the problem probably isn't them.\"\n\nSince Great Black Mountain was ruled out.\n\nThe only ones left were the two troublemaking 749 Investigators from Yaodu that he had arrested today.\n\n\"Looks like someone isn't taking this lying down...\" Lu Ding muttered.\n\nYou cause trouble in my jurisdiction, I arrest you, and you're still defiant? On what grounds are you defiant?\n\nThough it was just a guess for now, it wouldn't take much time to go back and check. He wouldn't get rich by saving that little bit of time. And if he could take care of someone who was planning to stir up trouble, it would be more than worth it.\n\nLu Ding picked up another piece of chicken and tossed it into his mouth. Since he was already here, he had to at least have a bite before leaving.\n\nBeside him, Bai Hemian was just about to pick up some food when he saw Lu Ding stand up. He sighed and put his chopsticks down again.\n\nYan Feifan watched. Of course, he knew what Lu Ding was going to do; after spending so much time together, he had long since figured out Brother Lu's way of doing things. He took the bowl from in front of Bai Hemian and put a chicken leg in it. \"Here, eat it on the way.\"\n\nLu Ding also said his goodbyes, \"I won't be eating today. You guys go ahead. I have to go see if someone is acting all high and mighty despite being in the wrong.\"\n\nDefiant?\n\nLu Ding's specialty was dealing with all kinds of defiance.\n\n***\n\n¹ An idiom, `拿著雞毛當令箭` (názhe jīmáo dāng lìngjiàn), literally \"to take a chicken feather as an order arrow.\" It means to treat a trivial item or minor authority as if it were a matter of great importance.\n\n² `厭勝法門` (yànshèng fǎmén) refers to a category of Chinese folk sorcery or witchcraft used to ward off or suppress evil influences.",

    "content": "......\n\nPrison 749.\n\nMonolithically cast, built with C1000 concrete and special-material steel reinforcement, with various other materials added for exorcism, evil-warding, and suppression, all in one.\n\nAs for how hard C1000 concrete is once it's cured?\n\nLet's put it this way.\n\nA rocket launcher wouldn't even leave a small pit on C140 concrete. C1000 could take a missile without a scratch.\n\nOne can imagine how hopeless the people locked in here felt.\n\nIt was all about one thing: once you were in, without going through proper procedures, you had absolutely no chance of getting out.\n\nAt the prison entrance.\n\nLu Ding presented the interrogation request. The laws for Qi Refiners were a bit different from the laws for ordinary people.\n\n749 investigators had the right to interrogate the criminals they themselves had captured.\n\nBut they couldn't take them out; it had to be done within the prison.\n\nThe paperwork was verified and approved.\n\nThe three of them walked inside.\n\nAfter passing through a twisting and winding path, their destination, the target cell, was just ahead.\n\nBefore they even arrived, they heard voices coming through the cell's audio surveillance system, transmitted into the hallway. This was installed as a precaution, in case the cell's soundproofing was so effective that no unusual sounds could get out, preventing patrolling guards from discovering anomalies in a timely manner.\n\nIt was equipped with filtering and alarm systems, linked to the prison's semi-intelligent terminal. If any spells transmitted through sound, or any poison gas or powders, were detected, the equipment inside would block them and sound an alarm.\n\nIf you wanted to cause trouble using this system, never mind whether you'd succeed, the alarm would go off instantly.\n\nAwaiting you would be a crowd of kind, gentle Prison Suppression Investigators, none of them wearing body cams.\n\nThis was the fusion of the esoteric and technology.\n\n\"You should just focus on your training for now. After all, you were in the wrong first. We don't have a leg to stand on.\"\n\nA female voice. It was Shangguan Qing speaking.\n\nThen another voice.\n\n\"Of course I'll focus on my training, but I can't just swallow this. Is he just going to get away with hitting me?\"\n\n\"On what grounds!?\"\n\n\"He was right, he was within the law, he was stronger, but I refuse to accept it. He hit me, and he expects me to just submit? He can just wait.\"\n\nHearing Chen Xian's words, Shangguan Qing paused in thought.\n\nAlthough she had a temper, a personality, and her own pride, she also understood what she should and shouldn't do once she put on this uniform.\n\nBefore Lu Ding's group had arrived, she had learned that Chen Xian had tried to snatch the Yimu Knot because of the Corpse Qi inside her body.\n\nIt was because of this that she felt she should try to correct Chen Xian's thinking.\n\n\"Um... I don't normally say these things, but today I want to tell you, no matter what, we are 749 investigators. We joined 749 and enjoy the benefits of 749.\"\n\n\"So we have to abide by 749's rules. We can't just take the benefits and not follow the rules. I'm not trying to lecture or scold you; I'm just telling you this from the perspective of a friend.\"\n\nAlthough she said this and had no other intentions, Chen Xian was still annoyed.\n\n\"We're all from 749, why can't there be some flexibility? A little room for discussion would be nice.\"\n\n\"Chen Xian, think of it this way. If you get some leeway, and he gets some leeway, then what's the point of having laws? If every mistake is met with flexibility, turning big problems into small ones and small ones into nothing... When we do something wrong, we have to own it. He was enforcing the law, and his procedures were correct.\"\n\n\"But the law should be tempered with mercy.\"\n\n\"But you have no personal connection with him. I have a connection with you, so I'll help you. You have a connection with me, so you tried to forcibly buy the Yimu Knot. That was the cause born from our connection, and being locked in here now is the effect. There are causes and effects; the world doesn't just revolve around us.\"\n\n\"Good outcomes come with bad outcomes. You can accept the good ones, so why can't you accept the bad ones?\"\n\nChen Xian was getting agitated. He was already annoyed about being beaten in front of Shangguan Qing.\n\nNow, he sat up straight, his voice filled with anger.\n\n\"I fucking refuse to accept him! He can just wait for me. Sooner or later, I will hit him back!!!\"\n\nThe act of sitting up brought his line of sight level with the transparent section of the glass door. He saw the three men standing outside, staring right at him.\n\nAs for why the three of them weren't speaking?\n\nWhy would they need to?\n\nThe body cam was on. All of Chen Xian's words were evidence!!\n\nOnly after the evidence was collected did Lu Ding finally speak: \"Feifan, did you record that?\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Brother Lu, I got all of it. He just admitted with his own mouth that you, Brother Lu, acted reasonably and lawfully. We didn't coerce a confession, we didn't force him, and the overhead surveillance camera recorded the whole thing. He said it all himself. Now he's plotting to retaliate against you. According to the Qi Refiner Management Regulations,\"\n\n\"He should be subject to caning.\"\n\nCaning was something that even the toughest body-refining hard-asses couldn't endure for more than three strikes. A special rattan cane hitting the buttocks... no matter what kind of tough guy you were, one lash would numb you, two would bring the pain, and three would have you screaming your head off.\n\n\"Alright. Open the door. Drag him out for interrogation!!\"\n\nIt was a bit against regulations, but as long as it was reasonable and lawful, it was fine.\n\nUnconvinced?\n\nWant to retaliate against him?\n\nPerfect. Let's take a trip to the little black room.\n\nTheir conversation was heard loud and clear.\n\nAt the thought of caning, Chen Xian's face changed instantly!\n\n\"What are you doing? This is against regulations! 749 investigators have the authority to enforce and carry out punishment, but that's outside! This is Prison 749! It's against regulations!!!\"\n\n\"Regulations? Are the regulations there for you to threaten an investigator whom you yourself admitted was acting reasonably and lawfully? This is you knowingly breaking the law!!\"\n\nLu Ding finished, then adjusted his tone and continued staring at him. \"The regulations are to protect the rights of those who abide by them. For someone who doesn't follow the rules, you naturally don't deserve the protections within them. Since you've broken the rules, you must bear the consequences of breaking them.\"\n\nThe moment the door opened a crack, Bai Heming was the first to charge in. With a *click*, he had Chen Xian pinned down.\n\nSeeing that things were going south, Shangguan Qing started to get up.\n\nLu Ding's gaze swept over to her, the pressure instantly overwhelming. \"Sit down.\"\n\nIn that moment, the scene of Lu Ding subduing her with a single move that day flashed through Shangguan Qing's mind.\n\nBesides, she couldn't find any fault with what Lu Ding had just said.\n\nA person who breaks the rules naturally cannot enjoy the protections within them. After all, Qi Refiners were not ordinary people. If they were truly held to the same legal standards as ordinary people, there would be far too many loopholes to exploit.\n\nNow, even Shangguan Qing couldn't refute Lu Ding. If anyone wanted to make trouble for him later, Lu Ding's words on the recording and the events happening now would be the best evidence.\n\nWhy else would he have wasted his breath on Chen Xian?\n\nThe action was reasonable, the procedure was lawful. As for being compliant with regulations? You didn't even follow the regulations yourself, so what right do you have to demand that I do?\n\nThe main point was to crush you from every angle, with no blind spots.\n\nWhether it was morality, regulations, or strength.\n\nA useful brain paired with a useful body, yet still running his mouth after making a mistake. Most likely, it's because the blows haven't landed yet. A good beating will fix him. He needs to know pain, and then he'll learn fear.",

    "content": "Only when dawn approached did the crying and shouting in the interrogation room cease.\n\nChen Xian was covered in snot and tears.\n\nHis mouth kept muttering, \"I submit, I submit, I truly submit, I was wrong, I was terribly wrong, I'm sorry to everyone, boo hoo hoo hoo......\"\n\nThat's right, he cried.\n\nChen Xian was considered to have some backbone, but even such a tough guy, under Yan Feifan and Bai Hemian's combination of civil and martial force, was forced to cry and shout in the interrogation room. Mainly because those three were too much of a bully.\n\nOne was in charge of swinging the whip, while another held the Regulations for Qi Cultivators in one hand and the 749 Investigator Regulations Act in the other. They'd come right up and ask you, \"What part do you not submit to?\"\n\nAt first, Chen Xian was still stubborn, saying he didn't not submit. But after taking a whip, he dared not be stubborn anymore, saying Lu Ding wouldn't let him speak, and even knocked him out after subduing him. Then he took another whip. The pain made Chen Xian call out for eighteen generations of his ancestors.\n\nBefore becoming a Qi Cultivator, this guy was just an ordinary person. His backbone was tough, but not to an extreme degree.\n\nAs soon as a whip landed, Yan Feifan would give him a legal education, saying that when 749 Investigators enforce the law outside, they possess all enforcement rights. Under clear regulations, if a criminal Qi Cultivator violates the Regulations for Qi Cultivators, 749 Investigators have the right to deprive you of your right to speech, freedom, action, and so on, to prevent the illegal Qi Cultivator from using talking, moving, and a series of other actions to cast spells to resist arrest and cause unnecessary casualties. Therefore, it's compliant, legal, and reasonable!\n\nCRACK!\n\nBai Hemian delivered another whip. The two, one civil and one martial, one on the left and one on the right, one asking \"What part do you not submit to?\" and the other specifically swinging the whip.\n\nMeanwhile, Lu Ding was holding a paper cup, drinking herbal tea, occasionally spitting out a bit. No matter what Chen Xian said, he didn't respond or pay attention. This cold treatment almost drove Chen Xian mad.\n\nBy the time of the last whip, Lu Ding had finally finished his herbal tea. With just one sentence, he scared Chen Xian into shouting \"I submit\" dozens of times: \"Go find a life-and-death pact. I'll sign it, then have him sign it.\"\n\nThis sentence instantly paralyzed Chen Xian with fear. That life-and-death pact, once signed, meant risking his life. He certainly didn't believe he could defeat Lu Ding. It was out of fear that he shouted \"I submit.\"\n\nThen, seeing he was merely scared, Yan Feifan took out his phone. It displayed the Cloud Sea 749 forum, which recorded all of Lu Ding's verifiable achievements. \"See for yourself clearly. A genius? A genius of just a few months.\"\n\nA question that would normally make him proud—today, Chen Xian couldn't utter a word. His eyes were fixed intently on the phone screen, terrified of missing a single detail.\n\nSuch a battle record, such a development time. Not submit? Why wouldn't he submit? If before it was out of fear, now it was genuine submission, submitting in every possible way. Before, his horizons were too narrow; he thought he was the heaven-sent prodigy, like a frog in a well gazing at the sky, only seeing a small corner. But now, seeing Lu Ding's achievements and cultivation time, Chen Xian had a feeling of sudden enlightenment, like a tiny mayfly seeing the vast sky. If it weren't for these clothes, he probably would have made him feel what true cruelty was...\n\nLooking up at Lu Ding, a strange thought surprisingly emerged in Chen Xian's mind. He clearly could have killed me... After the pain came clarity. Yan Feifan's numerous legal provisions directly gave him a harsh crash course in professional knowledge. Lu Ding's various exaggerated achievements further stimulated his pride as a genius. Such a person was actually willing to reason with him. What else did he have to not submit to...? He lowered his head, his tone sincere: \"I submit.\"\n\nHere, Chen Xian submitted.\n\nOn the other side.\n\nThe first-tier geniuses of Qing Province also submitted.\n\nOutside the Cloud Sea 749 guest meeting room, the Qing Province leader leading the team, along with leaders from Cloud Sea and Demon Capital, were all looking through the meeting room's glass at several figures inside. Inside were all the geniuses from Qing Province who had come to participate in this year's Martial Arts Convention. But today, after the incidents involving Chen Xian and Shangguan Qing came out, Lu Ding's name and achievements were churned up like cream, spreading thoroughly¹. These people immediately went to learn about Lu Ding's achievements. They didn't know until they looked, and when they did, they were shocked. Various instant kills, brutal kills, indiscriminate kills, cross-rank kills—his methods were clean and decisive, like something made up. As for Bai Hemian, this person wanted to kill a teammate!!!\n\nThe moment they saw this information, these few people from Qing Province only felt: \"Are you f***ing kidding me!?\"\n\nEspecially Lu Ding and Bai Hemian, who teamed up to assist Li Xuanlong in eliminating Shi Gandang. This was simply too outrageous. But this was news released from the official 749 forum; facts were facts. Two Spirit Seas ran off to fight a Fate Weaver alongside a Fate Weaver. They were both unhinged and wild, and they actually won. They truly had no regard for their lives, and their strength was outrageously powerful....\n\nAt that moment, on the smart screen in the meeting room, a loop of the footage from that night, showing Lu Ding and Bai Hemian teaming up to fight Shi Gandang, was playing. It was perfectly recorded from Li Xuanlong's law enforcement recorder's first-person perspective. When that charged-up, all-the-way slash came out, they only felt like the sky was about to collapse.\n\nThey incredulously took another look at Lu Ding's cultivation time. The sky... collapsed again. Does this mean he got first merit at the Ghost Festival, converted it into resources, and then, dividing it evenly by his cultivation speed, he became even stronger? They couldn't fight him to begin with, and now you're telling me he got even stronger? Updating every few days, iterating in the blink of an eye—how do you fight that?\n\nIt's true that geniuses have pride, but geniuses aren't idiots. The chasm between a genius and such a monster is far greater than the gap between an ordinary person and a genius. The few instantly lost their will to fight. They weren't fighting an enemy; they were all colleagues. Why go seek abuse? \"You're telling us to fight this kind of monster, and you're telling me he's in the same batch as me?!\" What's the difference between this and telling Benbo'erba to take on Sun Wukong?\n\n\"Can't fight him, I certainly can't. If I encounter him, I'll surrender. I'm serious, I don't have that special hobby; I don't want to be abused.\"\n\"If it were an enemy, or a demon or monster, I wouldn't confront him unless absolutely necessary. If I really couldn't avoid it, at worst I'd just close and open my eyes and start over. But now he and I are both 749 Investigators, we're colleagues, why would I seek abuse?\"\n\"Forget about one-on-one. With Lu Ding's demeanor, even if we all went at him together, it would be tough.\"\n\"You still want to win?\"\n\"My point is, it would be tough to survive. Win? It's already dawn outside; don't dream in broad daylight, it's tiring.\"\n\"Hmm, that makes sense. It's not shameful.\"\n\"I also don't think it's shameful. Just surrender directly if you meet him.\"\n\nHearing the words from inside the meeting room, the Qing Province leader outside, his face as black as the bottom of a pot, quickly pulled Director Chu to a nearby corner.\n\n\"Hey Chu!!! Deputy Director Chu of Cloud Sea!!!!\"\n\"You explain to me, what's with this monster-like newcomer of yours!!!?\" Saying this, he then answered his own question: \"Ah! I understand! So you're playing us two factions for fools, then. I wondered why there was never a proposal for several factions to play together before. Turns out you were brewing something big all along! Did that little kid called Lu Ding learn that from you!?\"\n\"He brewed something big on the road, and without a word, threw it at the monster the moment they met. He stunned the monster, and he stunned me too! You're telling me this is a newcomer? This is a f***ing newcomer!!!?\"\n\n---\n¹ Literally \"churned up like cream.\" This idiom implies that the information spread rapidly and thoroughly, becoming widely known and discussed, much like cream is fully integrated and transformed when whipped.",

    "content": "...\n\n\"So, Chu, no wonder you were always trying to keep us from seeing your forums. Turns out you were hiding some tricks up your sleeve!\"\n\nDeputy Director Chu couldn't manage a laugh, nor could he feign a serious expression.\n\nHe should have been happy that such a rookie had appeared under his command, but this was just too terrifying. The rookies from the other bureaus were so scared they were ready to yell \"surrender\" on sight.\n\nThe main reason the other bureau leaders had proposed the Three-District Martial Arts Tournament was because Lu Ding's combat prowess was just too monstrously strong.\n\nIt wasn't even an internal decision; he was the universally acknowledged number one.\n\nBai Heming was number two.\n\nNo one else had any intention of even trying to compete.\n\nThat's why they had organized the Three-District Martial Arts Tournament. But now, it wasn't just the rookies from Yunhai 749 who had lost all motivation; the rookies from the other two districts had lost it as well.\n\nThe leader from Yaodu finally came to his senses.\n\n\"Ohh~ So that's why you were suddenly so impulsive. This is what you were waiting for.\"\n\n\"The First-Year Martial Arts Tournament is supposed to inspire all new investigators. Now, with these two little monsters of yours on the stage, inspiration? They've been beaten down so hard they're smoking and can't even breathe. Our bureau's Shangguan Qing is still locked up in your prison.\"\n\n\"And what was it? Giving him a taste of his own medicine???\"\n\n\"How are we supposed to compete now? You tell me! They've all agreed to surrender on sight, and it was a unanimous vote! How do we compete!?\"\n\nDirector Chu looked a little awkward. Whoops, my little trick has been found out.\n\n\"Hehehe...\"\n\n\"Well, you guys come up with a plan, then.\"\n\nHe laughed awkwardly, but deep down, he was so thrilled he could barely contain himself.\n\nSO SATISFYING!!!!\n\nThis was the feeling!!!\n\nIt was just as Lu Ding had said that day; he'd gotten to pull off a major flex. And it wasn't just him; Director Chu had gotten in on it, too.\n\nThe leaders from the other two districts pondered.\n\nAfter a long while: \"Give those two a spot each. Guarantee it. A direct promotion. Just don't let them come and demoralize my seedlings.\"\n\nDirector Chu mused, \"Hmm... I don't think we have a precedent for guaranteed spots... If we set one...\"\n\n\"What!? Just because there wasn't one before, we can't have one now? And if we have it now, does that mean we must have it in the future? If we don't guarantee them spots, what do you suggest we do?\"\n\n\"Guaranteed spots, guaranteed spots. I'll contact the advanced training grounds and give them a heads-up.\"\n\n\"Alright. Feng, you go get Shangguan Qing. Prepare for the Three-District Martial Arts Tournament.\"\n\n\"What about Chen Xian?\"\n\n\"Let him stay locked up!!\"\n\nReceiving this order, Instructor Feng hurried to the 749 Prison with Li Xuanlong. When they got near the cell door, they saw there was only one person inside!?\n\nThey asked Shangguan Qing.\n\nHe had been taken away for interrogation.\n\nInstructor Feng shouted, \"This is bad!\"\n\nThe two of them rushed towards the interrogation room and threw open the door.\n\nChen Xian was hanging on the interrogation rack. The man with the ashen face rushed up and asked, \"Chen Xian, how are you? Are you alright?\"\n\nSeeing his instructor, Chen Xian's eyes instantly filled with tears.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Instructor... I've brought shame upon Yaodu 749. I shouldn't have... I deeply realize... I violated Article 219 of the Qi Refiner Management Act... and Article 32 of the 749 Investigator Regulations... and also...\"\n\nHis performance left Instructor Feng at a loss, unable to get angry, unable to stay silent, just frozen awkwardly in place.\n\nWhy was he reciting these regulations and laws more fluently than he himself could?\n\nSo you knew you made all these mistakes, huh.\n\nBut... this...\n\nHe looked again at Lu Ding's group of three.\n\nYou people...\n\nLi Xuanlong grinned, showing his teeth.\n\nHe had thought Lu Ding would stir up some incredible trouble.\n\nOn the way here, he had watched the surveillance footage from Chen Xian's prison cell. The result was that Lu Ding had acted completely within the law. It wasn't entirely by the book, but Chen Xian had been the first to disregard the rules.\n\nAnd now, looking at the result.\n\nPerfect. Simply too perfect.\n\nLook at that, tamed into complete submission.\n\nThat attitude, that expression, that tone, that emotional state—he had absolutely, in the truest sense, realized his mistakes.\n\nAs expected, a genius like this had to be dealt with by a monster of an even higher order.\n\nEach one of them was arrogant beyond measure, completely lawless. Now they knew what a real monster was, didn't they?\n\n\"Teacher Li, if there's nothing else, we'll be going. The sun's up, and we still have to participate in the First-Year Martial Arts Tournament.\"\n\nLi Xuanlong stopped him. \"You and Bai Heming don't need to compete. The geniuses from the other districts have either been taught a lesson by you or scared off by the two of you. You're both guaranteed a spot for advanced training. Go find Director Chu in a bit; he has something to tell you.\"\n\nHearing this, Chen Xian actually felt a sense that this was how it should have been.\n\nIf they had just done this from the start, he wouldn't be in this state. They were using him as bait...¹\n\nLu Ding: ??????\n\nNo beginner's tournament?\n\nHe had been looking forward to it. How did he suddenly get a guaranteed spot?\n\nWere the psychological constitutions of these geniuses from other districts all this fragile?\n\nScared?\n\nEven Lu Ding himself found that ridiculous.\n\nAll he did was have a slightly higher cultivation level, know a few more techniques, have slightly more powerful techniques, a slightly stronger physique, and a slightly shorter training time.\n\nWhere was the pride of a genius?\n\nLu Ding silently pulled open the door and walked out.\n\nThis scene happened to be witnessed by Shangguan Qing, who was waiting outside. He must have been reprimanded, she thought.\n\nActually, by the standards of an investigator, he didn't seem to have done anything wrong.\n\nSeeing her standing there, Lu Ding asked casually, \"Why didn't you go in?\"\n\n\"The caning requires taking off your pants.\"\n\nRight, a girl wouldn't go watch another person's bare bottom.\n\nWith just that one exchange, Lu Ding left with his people.\n\nA short while later, Instructor Feng emerged, supporting Chen Xian.\n\nSeeing that Shangguan Qing was still there, he urged, \"Hurry up and go to the Three-District Martial Arts Tournament.\"\n\nShangguan Qing nodded. At that moment, Chen Xian said weakly, \"You have to get a spot for advanced training.\"\n\nNow that those two were gone, with her strength, she could definitely secure a spot.\n\nThe girl turned to leave, then stopped, turned back, and spoke with supreme confidence.\n\n\"I will take first place and personally reclaim the honor of Yaodu 749!!\"\n\nThe other three fell silent instantly.\n\nInstructor Feng thought for a moment. \"Well... there are only seven spots left now.\"\n\nShangguan Qing froze. Although she could still get one of the seven, weren't there supposed to be nine spots for advanced training? Three per district, nine for three districts. Her math wasn't wrong.\n\n\"The most powerful one was guaranteed a spot.\"\n\nGuaranteed a spot!\n\nThis was a situation that had never happened before. An exception?\n\nShangguan Qing found it hard to understand. Just what kind of person could be given an exception for a guaranteed spot?\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Lu Ding, who just walked past you.\"\n\nBOOM!!!!\n\nShangguan Qing felt a clap of thunder explode by her ear. She had once heard Yan Feifan call Lu Ding \"Brother Lu.\"\n\nThat was enough. Just hearing that name was enough.\n\nLu Ding's face appeared in her mind.\n\nHe... was actually a new investigator, just like her?\n\nA rookie? You're telling me he's a rookie?\n\nSeeing her dazed expression, Li Xuanlong struggled to hold back his laughter. Instructor Feng sighed inwardly. Great, another one scared stiff. And this one had personally experienced Lu Ding's power, as well as his talent.\n\nShangguan Qing unwillingly asked one last question.\n\n\"So... when did he...\"\n\n\"Last month!\" Li Xuanlong could already buzz in with the answer!!!!\n\n***\n\n¹A fishing term, meaning to use bait to attract fish to a certain spot. Here, it implies Chen Xian was used to set an example or test the waters.",
