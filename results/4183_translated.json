    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water, Zhou Ze splashed it on his face, then slowly raised his head, looking at his reflection in the mirror. He looked a little haggard, a common sight for an emergency room doctor.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. They seem to have fallen from a building, not sure if it was a suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called from the men's restroom doorway.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there.\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out some tissues to dry his face and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly pulled into the hospital. On the stretcher lay an elder in a gray Tang suit. He was coughing incessantly, occasionally spewing out bloody foam and fragments of internal organs, his entire body covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition. At the same time, he shouted to the person in front, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very poor.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe elder opened his eyes and looked at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these words at such a time. Those who can face death calmly are, after all, a minority. As a doctor, this is certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition or tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly grabbed Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Steady your emotions, relax. Your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist felt a bit sore, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down there again... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe elder's fingernails were long, and for some unknown reason, they were black, a translucent black like amber, not like dirt had accumulated in them.\n\nAt this moment, the elder's fingernails had already embedded themselves in the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly sat up and coughed violently. Then, his body trembled, the hand gripping Zhou Ze's wrist fell away, and he became motionless.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe elder was wheeled into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitative measures, and the defibrillator was ready.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me treat your wound.\" Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about minor skin injuries. What worried them most was the risk of occupational exposure if the elder had other diseases. After all, there was a lot of blood on the elder's hands, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone's spirits were a bit low, but for them, such things were commonplace, and they would soon adjust.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let's get you checked out.\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something else tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got into his car, and drove away.\n\nAs soon as the car reached under the Jianghai Avenue viaduct, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient delayed me. I'm on my way now, please ask the children to wait a little longer for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other side quickly hung up the phone.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM, and the children at the orphanage usually went to bed early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"Honk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and drove over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look at the blinding high beam from the car window,\n\nThen,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly flung away by the heavy truck, tumbling several times in the air before crashing onto the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up,\n\nHe found that his body was completely unable to move, as if it was stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he really wanted to check his injuries now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he occasionally heard the sound of other vehicles passing by, and various horn honks.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car sounded, and the sound of a fire truck,\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance arrived.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a bit high; they must be cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity for the cake in his back trunk and the June 1st Children's Day party for the orphanage children; it would have to be cancelled.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered an unexpected disaster.\n\nThere were also sounds of several nurses nearby. Because the surroundings were too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear clearly.\n\nBut then, Doctor Chen's next sentence plunged Zhou Ze's heart into a deep abyss!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the sound of several nurses he knew crying,\n\nDoctor Chen punched the nearby car door, looking very distressed.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI should be in a state of suspended animation now,\n\nToo much blood loss?\n\nSeriously injured?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared frantically in his mind.\n\nBut then, he felt himself being lifted onto a stretcher, likely being put into an ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, he heard the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded particularly harsh to Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy cry!\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the hospital director's voice:\n\n\"Little Zhou is just... gone?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very serious. Dr. Zhou was overly injured and lost too much blood. He's been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone like that?\" Another vice director still didn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his superiors or elders.\n\nThey actually declared him dead,\n\nBut can a dead person still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nScum,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move, the surroundings were quiet, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Suqin Jie, I just can't believe it, someone just... gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"Heaven has unpredictable winds, and people have unforeseen misfortunes. Just try to see past it.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAround him,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, kept trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately wanted to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like sleep paralysis; no matter how much he tried, his body simply wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair,\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted,\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nIn the hospital,\n\nMortuary.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and a clear stinging sensation.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" Someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, just a moment. He was hit so badly; how could the makeup be done so quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital's rushing us; they need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it then?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit angry, pressing harder with the makeup brush. Of course, their clients were dead people; dead people wouldn't complain about pain, and there was no fear of complaints, they just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush repeatedly pressing against his face,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. We're done with our work.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed into clothes, and then he was pushed out. The hospital orderlies lifted him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be a cooling coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly cut off,\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown period, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the cooling coffin must have been opened.\n\nWhat he heard,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe director was holding a microphone, giving a speech, praising him, lamenting his passing,\n\nThen the vice director, the department head, and others.\n\nAround him,\n\nHe occasionally heard footsteps passing by,\n\nSome people just walked by quietly, taking a last look at him,\n\nSome even tried to call out to him several times, with a choked voice,\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe began to try again,\n\nBut still couldn't,\n\nHe could only hear and feel,\n\nBut couldn't speak,\n\nNor open his eyes,\n\nEveryone thought he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying by his side.\n\nThey cried genuinely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who grew up in an orphanage. Therefore, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage to celebrate June 1st Children's Day with the children that night.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation to the orphanage, don't worry.\" The vice director said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again; the lid of the cooling coffin must have been closed again.\n\nThen there was another bout of jostling,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the cooling coffin was opened again,\n\nThe surroundings were quiet, occasionally hearing human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and one holding his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, like a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, there were faint, distant cries.\n\nZhou Ze initially couldn't distinguish where he had arrived again,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood,\n\nBastards!\n\nThey had sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou beasts,\n\nScum!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis time, it was Zhou Ze's most frenzied moment, also his most desperate.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty, he hadn't married, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, I'll deal with you when we get home.\" The girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't sense it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was incredibly afraid!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one heard his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being grieved,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nThen going home for dinner and continuing their lives tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being pushed into a narrow place full of oily residue,\n\nThen,\n\nA sticky liquid sprayed onto his body,\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nGreat fire,\n\nEverywhere was fire..."

    "content": "Midnight streets,\n\nThe streetlights glowed yellow,\nAnd people shuffled uneasily.\nThe weather was cold, with a wind like knives cutting into flesh.\n\nZhou Ze also felt the cold.\nHe didn't know where he was again,\nBut he knew one thing:\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe had already died, but he had returned.\nHe didn't know what to do,\nHe could only mechanically and numbly keep walking forward.\nHe didn't have the time to think about too many other things right now,\nLike the place he had just descended to,\nLike the old man he had saved before his car accident,\nLike the faceless woman in a red dress in the pond,\nLike... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyful thing, but even when people occasionally walked by, and no matter how hard he tried to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\nHe was ostracized, isolated by this world.\n\nThose who haven't experienced \"solitary confinement\" won't understand the pain of complete isolation. For Zhou Ze, the entire world now was his prison, with a black cloth draped over it.\n\nNo one could see him,\nNor could anyone communicate with him,\nHe couldn't pick up anything solid,\nEven,\nThe wind could easily blow right through him.\nHe was so frail,\nThe phrase \"weak as a willow in the wind\" was no exaggeration when applied to him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that\nHe could see faint specks of light constantly dissipating from his body,\nIn other words,\nHis body was slowly fading.\nPerhaps in another quarter of an hour, he would completely disappear, erased without a trace.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this happened, but he knew his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li entered the body of a starving, collapsed person as a spirit, thus taking on the form he is known for in later generations.\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return to life.\" He wanted to borrow a corpse to return to life. He was cold and panicked; he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\nHe didn't even care who this person was.\n\nPeople are always selfish in such moments, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Besides, he really couldn't take it anymore.\n\nBut every time he prepared to approach someone, lights would appear above their head and shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even got hurt in the process, accelerating his \"dissipation.\"\n\nHe was a little tired, a little numb,\nHe was waiting for his end,\nWaiting for his finish.\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him somewhat more composed.\nMoreover, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would suffer torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\nAhead, there was a shop still lit up. It seemed to be a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\nSomeone pushed the door open and walked out; it was a man in a hoodie. The man wore a hat, obscuring his face. He looked left and right for a while, then hurried away.\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but soon after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\nYes,\nA warm aura.\nThis warmth bewildered Zhou Ze, but he was like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly gets a box of matches. Even if he knew the matches wouldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body passing directly through the bookstore's glass door. He continued inward, reaching behind the bookshelves.\nBehind the bookshelves,\nLay a person.\nIt was a handsome young man, perhaps only twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the shop, he wasn't wearing much—just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\nHe lay on the ground, but from him, Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling, like a pauper walking down the street at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, at this moment, had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of the young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to access the warmth he needed.\nHe extended a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embed themselves into the other's body.\nThis was a very strange feeling; unlike the \"breeze\" that blew through his body when he walked on the street earlier, this was a fusion, a merging with his fingernails as the medium.\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other's body. The two began to overlap.\n\n....................................................\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\nZhou Ze was jostled awake—no, to be precise, \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, where he had previously been resting his head on his hands.\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\nThe woman's voice was sharp and shrill, filled with an imperious tone.\nHe lifted his head and looked at the woman in front of him—no, to be precise, a girl, perhaps of high school age. Although she was a grown girl, she still had a touch of childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what do you mean by this? You've gotten bold, haven't you? You want to make my parents and my sister lose face, huh? You actually dared not come home all night!\nWho gave you the nerve!\"\n\nXu Le?\nWho was that?\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion, finding them smooth. His own hands used to have calluses from long hours of practicing surgical instruments, but these hands didn't.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\nThe girl slapped the counter, her presence aggressive.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection: an unfamiliar face. No, he had seen this face before—it was the face he saw last night.\nThis body,\nIs it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are angry, my mom's even throwing a tantrum at home. I'm telling you, what you eat, drink, and use now all comes from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\nWho are you trying to impress with this act?\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe it or not, I'll come over and smack you!\"\n\nThe girl made to raise her palm, but then she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg as he usually did. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little afraid.\nAt this point, she checked the time and saw it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school first. I'll settle this with you tonight!\"\nThe girl left huffily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and next to it, a cell phone.\nEven now, he hadn't fully adjusted to his change of identity.\nHe was Zhou Ze, a renowned young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\nNow,\nHe had become this identity.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nHe was... a live-in son-in-law?\nHe had a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" just now towards her \"brother-in-law,\" his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient traditions.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-to-door son-in-law,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. His status was even similar to that of a criminal; during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forcibly conscripted for border defense often included live-in sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up the phone. It wasn't password-protected, whether out of laziness or fear, but at least this made it easy for Zhou Ze to open his WeChat and QQ.\nHis QQ contact list was sparse, just a few middle school, high school, and college classmates. Then there was a family list with only one person, labeled \"Wife.\"\nHe opened the chat history with her on QQ; it was empty.\nAlright,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried searching. He found the woman labeled \"Wife.\" Here, there were replies. Mostly, Xu Le would ask about things like what to eat tonight, what needed to be prepared tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how his body was, and a whole lot more.\nThe other party's replies were often perfunctory and distant,\nConsisting of:\n\"Oh\"\n\"Mm\"\n\"Okay\"\nInstead.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This social dynamic was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails were no different from anyone else's.\nBut in the events leading up to his car accident—saving the old man who had pinched him, escaping the faceless woman, entering this guy's body—his fingernails had played a crucial role.\n\nHis will moved,\nAnd at that moment,\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly lengthening and becoming dark and translucent. There was even a faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n\"Whew...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nClosed his eyes,\nAnd when he opened them again,\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there trying to adapt to his new identity, and also to calm the sense of unease caused by his identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, perhaps forgetting or simply not feeling hungry.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's former home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\nBy afternoon, Zhou Ze sighed and slowly stood up. \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do,\" he thought.\nHe started trying to clean the bookshelves. All in all, he needed to find something to do for himself.\n\nThe old man who had pinched him before he died had said \"he's been found,\" and the faceless woman in the underworld had said, \"you'll be caught sooner or later.\" These words had given Zhou Ze a sense of crisis.\nHis current state was a \"temporary survival.\" To die and be reborn was an immense fortune, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to embrace this identity. It was best not to cause too much abnormality, not to attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business at this shop was truly terrible. The slump in the traditional book market hadn't been a one-day or two-day affair, and this location wasn't on the prime commercial street at a school gate.\nIt could only be said that for \"Xu Le\" to choose to open a bookstore here, just breaking even was probably a problem.\n\nIt wasn't until three in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\nThe customer browsed the children's books section for a long time.\nZhou Ze waited a while, then walked over and asked, \"What genre are you looking for?\"\nThough, Zhou Ze didn't understand it either.\n\"Just looking around,\" the other person replied.\n\"Hmm.\" Zhou Ze didn't bother him anymore. He hadn't fully settled into the role of \"bookstore owner\" yet.\n\nBut just then,\nThe other person suddenly walked behind him and said quietly,\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and robbed you of your money.\nAnd I even specifically checked,\nYou clearly had no breath left back then.\""

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned. So, the reason he could possess Xu Le’s body last night was because Xu Le had just been killed?\n\nAnd because the body was still warm, he could enter it?\n\nLooking at it this way, he seemed to be quite lucky.\n\nWithout disgust, anger, or the panic of his identity potentially being exposed, Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the man, who was about his age.\n\nThe man was startled.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze’s eyes.\n\nIt was joy.\n\nIt was relief.\n\nAnd even,\n\nA hint of appreciation.\n\nAs a host, Zhou Ze clearly understood the difficult situation he faced last night. If this guy hadn't happened to commit murder at that time, he might have already dissipated, never to see the light of day.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night, and my head felt terrible this morning, like I was drunk. I forgot what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the other party would guess he was a ghost possessing a body, unless the other party was out of their mind.\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The other party pointed to his nose, somewhat absurdly, \"Even though I told you I hit you with a sneak attack yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine. I actually thank you for not taking my phone and computer from my desk.\"\n\n\"Uh... I forgot.\" The man scratched his head. \"It's good that you're okay. This is the money I stole from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then rummaged again and pulled out another eight hundred yuan.\n\n\"Eight hundred yuan is for your medical expenses, and three hundred is what I robbed yesterday,\" the man pursed his lips. \"Yesterday, I gambled online and lost all my salary to the bookie. When I passed your bookstore, I suddenly wanted some money. After I knocked you down, I realized you weren't breathing, and it scared me to death.\n\nI ran home and couldn't sleep all night, just thinking if the police would suddenly break in and arrest me. Robbery and murder. I only took three hundred yuan. I felt so stupid, it wasn't worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\n\"Buddy, it's really good you're not dead. Really, I've been wandering around outside since morning. I was waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for the police to come. But then I saw you were actually still in the bookstore.\n\nDo you know, at that moment, I almost knelt down and kowtowed to you. Thank you. You're tough, you didn't die. Otherwise, I would have been finished. There are so many cameras here. If you had died, I definitely wouldn't have gotten away.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, then at the \"murderer\" in front of him, tearfully repenting. He felt that this scene was very bizarre.\n\nHonestly, Xu Le died. Because he died, Zhou Ze could usurp the magpie's nest. And because Zhou Ze usurped the magpie's nest, this guy in front of him was exempt from the charge of murder.\n\nBoth Zhou Ze and this guy in front of him benefited. Only Xu Le, that unlucky wretch, got the short end of the stick.\n\n\"Alright, it's fine. Maybe I just had a stitch yesterday,\" Zhou Ze moved the other party's hand from his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor. What kind of filth hadn't he seen? But in that extreme environment, he developed a slight潔癖 (germophobia/cleanliness obsession). In fact, most emergency doctors have varying degrees of it.\n\nIt's precisely because they've seen too much dirt and grime that they appreciate \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" The man said with some joy.\n\n\"Mhm, I don't blame you.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"You go to work and live your life well. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy. You're an honest person.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily, left the bookstore, and went to embrace his \"new life.\"\n\nAs for Zhou Ze, he picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he still needed to call the police, not to report the other party for killing him (Xu Le), but to report the other party for suspected theft.\n\nAnyway, let the police investigate. If the other party really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and was caught by the police, it was what he deserved.\n\nHe had occupied someone else's body, so he ought to do something for that unlucky wretch.\n\nAlthough, given the other party's good attitude in admitting his mistake and even giving him medical expenses, his real-name report was indeed quite unethical, a bit like \"having a son with no asshole.\"*\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the operator's voice came through,\n\nAt the bookstore entrance,\n\nThat guy suddenly returned.\n\n\"One more thing...\" The other party had just walked in when he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He was startled and directly pointed at Zhou Ze, \"You son of a bitch, you're still going to call the police, aren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone, give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You don't keep your word, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly entered an excited and agitated state. His mental state might have some issues, possibly due to long-term gambling and being disconnected from society. He tended to become extreme when stimulated by certain things.\n\nThe other party lunged forward. Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to retreat.\n\nHe was a doctor in his previous life, not a boxer, and hadn't practiced martial arts. This current body was also somewhat weak. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was truly a bit flustered.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man slammed Zhou Ze against the wall and then began to desperately grip Zhou Ze's neck with both hands.\n\n\"I'll let you call the police, I'll let you call the police, I'll let you break your word! Fine, I'll let you die, really die! This time I'll choke you to death and then drain your blood! Let's see if you still don't die!\"\n\nThe man roared through gritted teeth.\n\nPoor bookstore business. In the afternoon, let alone customers, there weren't even many pedestrians outside.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. In the process of struggling, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and long.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his hands around the other party's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shuddered, rolled his eyes, and directly released Zhou Ze's neck. He staggered back a few steps, knocked over several bookshelves, and then collapsed.\n\nZhou Ze was freed. He reached up and rubbed his neck. He hadn't been too panicked before. After all, his fingernails could even harm evil spirits from hell. Dealing with an ordinary person shouldn't be a big problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze still wasn't entirely clear about the specific origin and use of these fingernails. He only knew that they should have been \"infected\" by the old man he saved before his car accident.\n\nIt was truly,\n\nLike getting athlete's foot, one infection spreads to two.\n\nHe walked over and squatted down. Zhou Ze reached out and patted the man's face. Thankfully, he wasn't dead, still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n………………\n\nAfter completing the statement at the police station, the police officer told Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall. Because the incident Zhou Ze reported was a bit strange—saying that someone came to rob him but the one knocked out was the \"perpetrator\"—and this perpetrator was still in the hospital, they needed to wait for him to wake up for further confirmation.\n\nHowever, at least the police officer didn't handcuff Zhou Ze.\n\nSquatting next to Zhou Ze was a middle-aged man whose left hand was locked to the radiator.\n\n\"Bro, you're awesome. That guy tried to rob you, and you knocked him out?\" The slovenly middle-aged man said while rubbing his long, dirt-matted bangs. \"You really have my youthful spirit. You have to beat these clueless thieves to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you behave yourself.\" A young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. \"How many times have you stolen electric scooters this winter?\n\nI'm telling you, it's almost Chinese New Year. Can't you just settle down? Or find a proper job to earn some money and send it home? You're a grown man.\"\n\n\"It's impossible to work, absolutely impossible to work in this life. I don't know how to do business. Only by stealing electric scooter batteries can I make a living. Going to the detention center feels like going home.\n\nEveryone inside is talented, and they speak so nicely. I love it there!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to bother with this guy anymore and turned to leave.\n\n\"Bro, how was my speech just now?\" The greasy middle-aged man gave Zhou Ze a flirtatious look.\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol. Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Let me tell you, life has to be...\" The greasy middle-aged man paused, his gaze fixed on the doorway, and said, \"Oh my goodness, how beautiful! Is that a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the doorway, a woman in a blue down jacket and long leather boots was walking towards them with another female police officer.\n\n\"Probably a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, her temperament was the most captivating.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a uniform,\" the greasy man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe she's plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right, a beautiful police officer, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in more often in the future.\" The greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, still unsatisfied. \"If I could marry her, I'd willingly shorten my life by ten years.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He didn't dare to joke about lifespan and longevity anymore.\n\n\"You disagree?\" The greasy man saw Zhou Ze shake his head and anxiously said, \"You're blind, you know that? For a woman like that, losing ten years of life for her is definitely worth it...\"\n\nAt that moment, the female police officer and the woman in long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to take you home. The investigation is clear; you're free to go,\" the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" The greasy middle-aged man.\n\n---\n**Footnote:**\n* **生兒子沒*****兒的意思 (shēng érzi méi pìgu'er de yìsi):** A highly vulgar idiom meaning \"to have a son with no asshole,\" implying extreme lack of virtue or doing something extremely immoral/unethical."
