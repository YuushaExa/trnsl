    "content": "2010, Summer.\n\n\n\n  It was scorching hot, comparable to Tokyo.\n\n\n\n  East China Province, Jiangcheng University, a certain dormitory building.\n\n\n\n  \"Brother Qi, wake up! Your phone's been ringing for ages. I figured it must be something important.\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi was sleeping soundly when he suddenly felt someone forcefully pulling his blanket.\n\n\n\n  Who is it? So annoying!\n\n\n\n  Wait, didn't I rent a studio apartment? How could there be other people?\n\n\n\n  His body jolted, Guo Qi instantly woke up and quickly sat up from the bed.\n\n\n\n  An unfamiliar environment, it looked like a university dormitory.  A burly man, bare-chested, was still pulling his blanket.\n\n\n\n  Where am I?\n\n\n\n  How did I get here?\n\n\n\n  What does this brother want to do?\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  Countless question marks flooded his mind, Guo Qi rubbed his temples, feeling a headache.\n\n\n\n  He must have drunk too much last night.  He hadn't seen his old classmates in years, and the few of them really went wild, ordering six cases of beer alone.\n\n\n\n  \"Brother Qi, what's wrong? Feeling unwell?\" The burly man walked over and gently shook Guo Qi's shoulder.\n\n\n\n  This shake was no small matter; instantly, a tidal wave of information poured into his brain.\n\n\n\n  After an unknown amount of time, Guo Qi gradually recovered from his dazed state, and a fact gradually solidified in his heart.\n\n\n\n  I, Guo Qi, have time-traveled.\n\n\n\n  I've traveled to a world that is overall similar to the previous one but also has many differences.\n\n\n\n  And I've transformed from an insignificant and mediocre company clerk into a college student at Jiangzhou University.\n\n\n\n  Jiangda's ranking in the country isn't very high, but it's considered a well-known university in East China Province, and the employment prospects for graduates here are quite good.\n\n\n\n  However, the original Guo Qi seemed to be rather unambitious.\n\n\n\n  He had starred in a moderately famous TV series, \"Little Dragon God,\" when he was young, making him a semi-child star. Unfortunately, the following few dramas received lukewarm responses, and he gradually faded out of the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n  But in Guo Qi's heart, the dream of becoming a star never died.\n\n\n\n  If acting didn't work out, then he would take the singer-songwriter route.\n\n\n\n  After getting into Jiangda, the original Guo Qi devoted almost all his energy to music.\n\n\n\n  Except for exams, he hardly ever went to class. He spent most of his time recording works, and the rest going to bars to sing for tips to earn a living.\n\n\n\n  The style of Chinese music in this world is even more barren.\n\n\n\n  To cater to popular aesthetics, the original Guo Qi chose a pop style leaning towards R&B, mixed with some campus elements. Led by the four little heavenly kings of Mandopop, this is also the most crowded style among mainstream singers, making the competition extremely fierce.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi, lacking personal characteristics, although he put in a lot of effort, his music didn't receive much response. Last night, the original Guo Qi received another rejection letter from a record company.\n\n\n\n  Dejected and sad, he drank excessively at a bar.\n\n\n\n  .......\n\n\n\n  \"Brother Qi, what's wrong? If you're really unwell, I'll accompany you to the school hospital.\" The burly man asked with concern.\n\n\n\n  With the original owner's memories, Guo Qi recognized him this time.\n\n\n\n  The burly man was his roommate, named Wang Cheng, a righteous and enthusiastic northeastern man. He usually helped everyone a lot in the dorm.\n\n\n\n  \"No need, Brother Cheng, I probably drank too much last night.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Alright, take a look at your phone; someone has been calling. There's a campus recruitment fair at Wanteng this afternoon; I'm going to find Xingzhou and the others.\"\n\n\n\n  Wang Cheng casually threw on a few clothes, grabbed his resume, and went out.\n\n\n\n  The dorm room was suddenly left with only Guo Qi.\n\n\n\n  \"Slap.\"\n\n\n\n  Seeing no one around, Guo Qi couldn't help but slap himself twice.\n\n\n\n  嘶.....\n\n\n\n  His cheek hurts.\n\n\n\n  It seems it wasn't a dream!\n\n\n\n  Having encountered such a good thing as time travel, what should I do next?\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi was still pondering when his phone on the bedside table buzzed twice, someone had sent a message.\n\n\n\n  It was Yang Dali, the owner of the bar where he sang.\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  【Guo Qi, what's wrong with your phone being unreachable?】\n\n\n\n  【Are you still coming? Do you still want the 300 yuan for tonight's performance?!】\n\n\n\n  【If you delay the bar's business, you'll see!】\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  Such an arrogant tone?\n\n\n\n  It's just 300 yuan?\n\n\n\n  I'll send it back to you immediately!\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi rubbed his fingers, clicked on [Transfer Red Packet], and entered [300].\n\n\n\n  A \"drip\" sound, the system prompted that the transfer failed.\n\n\n\n  [Insufficient bank card balance (if it is a credit card, the credit limit is insufficient, please verify before trying again)]\n\n\n\n  He tried another card, the prompt remained the same.\n\n\n\n  He switched from wifi to mobile data, the prompt remained the same.\n\n\n\n  Well, it seems it's not a signal problem.\n\n\n\n  This guy is actually so poor, he doesn't even have 300 yuan!\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi: \"......\"\n\n\n\n  He silently deleted the unsent message, 【Take your stinky money, don't bother me】, and replaced it with a docile and obedient message: 【Sorry, Manager Yang, I'll be there on time tonight】\n\n\n\n  At this moment, a transparent light curtain suddenly appeared in front of Guo Qi, with lines of text displayed on it.\n\n\n\n  In his mind, there was also a light and ethereal female voice reporting synchronously.\n\n\n\n  【Ding, system binding successful…】\n\n\n\n  【Host: Guo Qi】\n\n\n\n  【Reputation Conversion System successfully activated, click to view more information】\n\n\n\n  \"Huh?\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi was stunned at first, then fell into ecstatic joy.\n\n\n\n  Sure enough, just like those protagonists in online novels, time travelers will have golden finger buffs, thus embarking on the peak of their lives.\n\n\n\n  \"Whew,\" Guo Qi breathed a sigh of relief, his fingers trembling slightly with excitement as he clicked on the page and began to view more information.\n\n\n\n  【System Description】\n\n\n\n  1. The host must not disclose the existence of the system in any way.\n\n\n\n  2. To encourage the host to engage in corresponding behaviors, at the end of each settlement period, the change value of the host's reputation will be converted into currency and added to the host's account according to the conversion ratio.\n\n\n\n  The surplus conversion ratio is the proportion of the increase in the host's reputation value in each settlement period that is converted into currency.\n\n\n\n  The loss conversion ratio is the proportion of the decrease in the host's reputation value in each settlement period that is converted into currency.\n\n\n\n  3. As the host's level increases, this system will automatically unlock upgraded versions.\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  After a cursory glance, Guo Qi was immediately attracted by the content of clause 2.\n\n\n\n  What does it mean?\n\n\n\n  Every time the settlement period ends, the changes in my reputation will be converted into my personal wealth?\n\n\n\n  Clicking on [I have read the terms and conditions and confirmed], the system automatically proceeded to the next step.\n\n\n\n  【Conversion ratio, randomly confirming…】\n\n\n\n  Then two roulette-like templates appeared on the page, one for surplus and one for loss. The pointer spun for a while, and finally stopped in Guo Qi's anticipation.\n\n\n\n  【Ding-dong】\n\n\n\n  【Surplus conversion ratio confirmed as 0.1】\n\n\n\n  【Loss conversion ratio confirmed as 100】\n\n\n\n  With the system prompt, Guo Qi saw that his personal information on the page had indeed changed accordingly.\n\n\n\n  【Personal Information】\n\n\n\n  Name: Guo Qi\n\n\n\n  Current Reputation: 25601\n\n\n\n  Level: V1\n\n\n\n  Surplus Conversion Ratio: 0.1\n\n\n\n  Loss Conversion Ratio: 100\n\n\n\n  Current Settlement Period: 7 days\n\n\n\n  It seemed that the system was worried that Guo Qi couldn't fully understand it, and this time it proactively provided explanatory information.\n\n\n\n  【Host's current reputation value (actual number of fans) 25601, the current settlement period is 7 days. The system will monitor the changes in the host's reputation value in real-time after 7 days and convert it into the host's personal wealth according to the conversion ratio.】\n\n\n\n  【To ensure the sustainability of the data for this research, when the host's reputation reaches zero, the system will automatically replenish the reputation value to 5000.】\n\n\n\n  \"This system is interesting.\" Such a conscientious system couldn't help but make Guo Qi very moved.\n\n\n\n  According to the system, whether the reputation goes up or down, Guo Qi will eventually make money, it's just a matter of how much money.\n\n\n\n  It all depends on how to operate to maximize profits.\n\n\n\n  If he takes the route of gaining fans, Guo Qi concluded in his heart: it's a thankless task.\n\n\n\n  After all, the original Guo Qi had struggled for several years and only accumulated a total of 25601 fans, and most of them were gathered on Xinchao Weibo.\n\n\n\n  These people were attracted by his high-value photos; very few truly appreciated Guo Qi's musical talent.\n\n\n\n  Even if he's lucky and attracts another 10,000 fans with his looks, with a conversion ratio of 1, it's only a little over 1,000 yuan.\n\n\n\n  But if he takes the route of losing fans…\n\n\n\n  That's a different story!\n\n\n\n  He only needs to scold people on Weibo, post vulgar information, and preferably post some banned words to get his account banned by the authorities, wouldn't he lose countless fans in minutes?\n\n\n\n  Then multiply that by the tempting 100 loss conversion ratio. If 20,000 fans are all gone, that's 2 million!!!\n\n\n\n  Thinking of this, Guo Qi's heart beat faster.\n\n\n\n  He smiled happily."

    "content": "【嘀！重要通知】\n\n\n  Seemingly aware of Guo Qi's inner thoughts, a notification suddenly popped up on the system page.\n\n\n  After clicking to view it, Guo Qi instantly understood that things weren't as simple as he had just thought.\n\n\n  Losing fans also requires adherence to basic laws!\n\n\n  【The host must engage in entertainment activities that conform to normal behavioral logic and are reasonable and legal】\n\n\n  【When the host exhibits the following behaviors, the system will refuse to provide wealth rewards and terminate cooperation with the host】\n\n\n  Profit-making Category:\n\n\n  1. Purchasing fans through secondary market channels via agreed-upon transactions,\n\n\n  2.

Maliciously violating platform rules and relevant laws and regulations, leading to account bans,\n\n\n  2. Maliciously insulting others, provoking trouble, and planning illegal activities leading to the host being restricted or banned,\n\n\n  3. Deliberately engaging in anti-social and anti-human activities,\n\n\n  4. Inducing or actively urging fans to unfollow, etc.,\n\n\n  ......（Click to view the remaining 198 violations)\n\n\n  Sure enough, the system wasn't a pushover either.\n\n\n  Guo Qi clicked on the screen, carefully studying these prohibited clauses, and one by one, he eliminated the fan-losing behaviors he had previously imagined.\n\n\n  In general, gaining fans should be done reasonably, and losing fans should also be done reasonably. You can be subjectively intentional, but you cannot directly use crooked ways.\n\n\n  No wonder the loss conversion ratio is so much higher than the profit conversion ratio. For ordinary people, reasonably losing fans is actually more difficult than gaining them.\n\n\n  However, Guo Qi didn't care much about this.\n\n\n  In his previous life, to kill time, he had watched almost all mainstream variety shows, and incidentally read a lot of celebrity gossip news.\n\n\n  Having seen many popular stars completely fall from grace due to a series of outrageous actions, with careful planning and good reference, there are always some outrageous actions that can be used.\n\n\n  Then, how could things not be successful?\n\n\n  After a little thought, several rough outlines of ideas had already taken shape.\n\n\n  Guo Qi nodded slightly, feeling confident.\n\n\n  Losing fans, what's so difficult about that?\n\n\n  Everything is under control.\n\n\n  .......\n\n\n  At the thought of receiving 2 million yuan in just 7 days by losing 20,000 fans, Guo Qi felt full of energy.\n\n\n  Action speaks louder than words. Guo Qi got out of bed, turned on his computer, and started searching for various related information, especially technology and entertainment news.\n\n\n  Led by Apple phones, various new smart devices have emerged, and technological entrepreneurship is booming.\n\n\n  Apps in forms similar to food delivery, ride-hailing, e-commerce, and live streaming are all developing rapidly.\n\n\n  The level of technology is similar, various software and hardware have already appeared, and some industries, such as chip and IoT, are even more developed.\n\n\n  Originally, the entertainment industry was supposed to be lagging behind, and the styles and forms of music and film and television were more barren.\n\n\n  But with the help of this wave of technological innovation and advanced industrial IoT technology, major music and film and television platforms and industry companies have jointly created a creation assistance platform that is even more advanced and convenient than in his previous life—Creator Assistance Platform, known in the industry as CAPO.\n\n\n  The emergence of CAPO has strengthened the awareness of industrial copyright and greatly facilitated the work of entertainment industry creators.\n\n\n  Many newcomers don't even need to use professional recording equipment. They can create moving music or even wonderful short films by relying on the recording tools and paid materials provided by CAPO.\n\n\n  The original owner, Guo Qi, as an ordinary college student, relied on the money he earned from singing to create musical works, thanks to the CAPO platform.\n\n\n  In the past two years, music and film and television works have exploded on various platforms, and various newcomers have begun to enter the public eye.\n\n\n  The entertainment industry is developing rapidly, and the entertainment culture derived from it is also rapidly approaching the level of his previous life.\n\n\n  Fandom culture, ranking battles, and infighting have begun to frequently become entertainment headlines.\n\n\n  \"It seems that the advanced fan-losing experiences from my previous life can all be used,\" Guo Qi felt more at ease.\n\n\n  Unknowingly, it was already noon. Guo Qi, whose stomach was rumbling, decided to go out for food.\n\n\n  As a key university, Jiangda's student cafeteria was naturally not sloppy.\n\n\n  A three-story independent building can accommodate tens of thousands of people for meals at the same time. The materials and decoration are simple and generous, and coupled with the Ministry of Education's university meal subsidies, the cafeteria's pricing is also of high quality and low price.\n\n\n  Therefore, every time it's meal time, the restaurant is full of Jiangda students queuing up for meals, including many pretty female students, causing male students to frequently look around.\n\n\n  Along the way, Guo Qi was trying to think about how to quickly lose fans.\n\n\n  To be honest, there are quite a few choices.\n\n\n  The current total number of fans is 25601, with 17288 on the Xinchao Weibo alone, and a small portion on the CAPO music platform.\n\n\n  For this group of users on the music platform, he could try releasing a few songs with a more niche and avant-garde musical style. As long as he made them as unpleasant as possible, there would be no shortage of people unfollowing him.\n\n\n  If it weren't for the system's regulations, Guo Qi would even have wanted to directly release noise, causing tons of mental damage.\n\n\n  Weibo fans are the main target of the initial attack. Since they are appearance fans, Guo Qi plans to take a few ugly selfies, which should have a certain effect.\n\n\n  .......\n\n\n  Immersed in his fan-losing ideas, Guo Qi didn't notice that, even without much dressing up, his handsome appearance still made him a sight in the eyes of many female students.\n\n\n  \"Look, that's Guo Qi, the senior.\"\n\n\n  \"He has such a good base. I thought he was wearing makeup. I didn't expect that he would look so handsome without dressing up.\"\n\n\n  \"I heard his music is also very good. Senior, are you going to be a star in the future?\"\n\n\n  \"He has signed with a music company, right? Such a senior is really excellent.\"\n\n\n  Guo Qi was still looking for an empty seat in the cafeteria while holding his tray when he heard the whispers of the female students next to him, and he couldn't help but be startled.\n\n\n  This is too exaggerated, am I that handsome?\n\n\n  He couldn't help but take out his phone and carefully examine his current appearance for the first time.\n\n\n  Well, it's true.\n\n\n  This young man is amazing. He really has something in terms of appearance. No wonder he was chosen to be a child actor when he was young.\n\n\n  He has a slender, fair oval face, three-dimensional and deep features, and his whole person has a bit of a mixed-race temperament, making people unconsciously unable to resist.\n\n\n  In the entertainment circle where handsome men and beautiful women gather, it might only be at a normal level, but among ordinary people, especially in the university campus where most boys have not yet cultivated their aesthetic style, he can be considered outstanding.\n\n\n  Just as Guo Qi was admiring himself, the female student who had finished her meal next to him was already blushing slightly, quickly cleaned up her tableware, and left a sentence, \"Senior, you can sit here, I'm done eating,\" and then shyly ran away.\n\n\n  \"Hey, classmate, didn't you just say I could sit here?\"\n\n\n  Seeing the seat being snatched away by the handsome guy, the ordinary, unattractive man standing next to him with a tray shouted angrily at the shy girl's departing back.\n\n\n  This world is always so cruel to unattractive men.\n\n\n  This won't do!\n\n\n  Guo Qi frowned and sat down, thinking as he ate. The female students' reactions made him realize a very serious problem.\n\n\n  A major obstacle on the road to losing fans.\n\n\n  It seems that I'm a little too handsome?\n\n\n  As a handsome guy, even if he intentionally takes some funny and ugly photos, they are easily regarded as cute and interesting by blindly ignorant appearance fans, who think he doesn't have any idol baggage.\n\n\n  Just like an unattractive man, carefully dressing up and choosing the right camera angle will be said to be making a fool of himself.\n\n\n  Under the supervision of the system, he couldn't fabricate false information or deliberately find fake photos of other people.\n\n\n  So the question is,\n\n\n  How can I become uglier?\n\n\n  How can I scare away those appearance fans on Weibo?"

    "content": "嗯.....\n\n\n\n  This is a good question.\n\n\n\n  On the way back to the dorm after dinner, Guo Qi pondered for a long time without any good ideas, so he lowered his head and started browsing the news.\n\n\n\n  This earnest and focused studious look again caused a female student to exclaim in surprise.\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  \"This, seems a little interesting.\"\n\n\n\n  After reading the system technology and entertainment report, Guo Qi was attracted by a sensational news headline—\"Makeup or Disguise, Young Man Sues Bride for Fraud the Day After the Wedding\".\n\n\n\n  From the title, one can roughly see the context of the whole event. Guo Qi was already used to seeing such news, but at this moment, he suddenly had an inspiration.\n\n\n\n  \"In this case, things will be easy to handle.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Intentionally making myself ugly might not have a good effect, I can cut off the root of the problem, make a few no-makeup videos, and let these fans know that the so-called high-value appearance is a false image created by makeup and beauty filters!\"\n\n\n\n  \"Psychology also has similar descriptions, the hardest thing for people to accept is being deceived. Fans who feel deceived will definitely be angry and unsubscribe.\"\n\n\n\n  \"It's a sure thing!\"\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  The performance at Bruce Bar doesn't start until eight o'clock in the evening, there's still plenty of time.\n\n\n\n  The great task of losing fans is urgent.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi returned to the dormitory and immediately began shooting comparison photos of himself with and without makeup.\n\n\n\n  In order to make the fans even more disheartened, he deliberately added several layers of dark and lifeless light to the no-makeup photos, and deliberately made his skin look rough and red.\n\n\n\n  A few comparison photos, it has the feel.\n\n\n\n  But something is still missing.\n\n\n\n  It wasn't until he opened his phone, ready to upload the photos, that Guo Qi suddenly realized.\n\n\n\n  It's the impact!\n\n\n\n  Photos are static, even with two comparisons, they are not eye-catching enough.  But if it's in video format, it will have a stronger sense of immersion and substitution, and the before-and-after makeup comparison will create a greater impact.\n\n\n\n  Although video production takes more work, for better fan loss, some hard work is necessary.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi deleted the pictures he was editing and began planning the video script and recording.\n\n\n\n  First, shoot a segment where he's meticulously dressed, that handsome and cool look.\n\n\n\n  Then remove the disguise layer by layer.\n\n\n\n  First, remove the beauty filter effect.\n\n\n\n  Then remove the makeup.\n\n\n\n  Finally, the plain face look.......No, what to do if the plain face is still a bit handsome?\n\n\n\n  Well, then add some more dark light, make the whole person look sallow, rough, and very listless.\n\n\n\n  Because the original owner frequently used the CAPO platform to produce audio-visual works, Guo Qi was also quite familiar with the platform's operation, and he specifically used several paid special effects to make the entire video more realistic and natural.\n\n\n\n  After working for almost two hours, the video was finally finished.\n\n\n\n  Clicking the play button.\n\n\n\n  \"Hello everyone, I'm your Xiao Qi. Many fans have commented, why are there so many handsome guys on Weibo, but none of them can be found in real life.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Then I'll give you a personal demonstration of how the handsome men and beautiful women on the internet reveal their true forms.\"\n\n\n\n  \"First, let's turn off the beauty filter..........then turn off the filter.......then remove the makeup, don't panic........\"\n\n\n\n  \"Whoa!!! Who is this ugly monster, oh, it's me, everyone, this is.........\"\n\n\n\n  ........\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi tapped his fingers on the desktop, carefully watched the video several times, and was very satisfied with the overall effect.\n\n\n\n  This powerful impact, this carefully designed narration, after uploading it will inevitably have a huge mental impact on the fans who like him for his appearance.\n\n\n\n  After all, which fan who likes someone for their appearance will care about a man who isn't handsome?\n\n\n\n  He used an affected title, 《Do you still love me like this?》, with an empty content description. In order to avoid new traffic coming in, Guo Qi simply did not choose any topic tags.\n\n\n\n  Everything was ready, Guo Qi confidently pressed the upload button.\n\n\n\n  One minute later, the video appeared on his homepage timeline.\n\n\n\n  Currently, Guo Qi's Weibo has 17,288 followers, and some have set him as a special follow, so soon, comments began to appear below the video.\n\n\n\n  \"It's eye-burning, you are such a Xiao Qi!\"\n\n\n\n  \"Men are all big pigs hooves, can I still believe in this world?\"\n\n\n\n  \"Add oil, Xiao Qi, I may be busy with work in the future, and I won't be able to chat with you again.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Am I the only one who thinks the blogger still looks pretty good without makeup?\"\n\n\n\n  \"Xiao Qi, you're so honest.\"\n\n\n\n  \"No more to say, unsubscribing.\"\n\n\n\n  .....\n\n\n\n  Looking at the overwhelming negative comments below, the number of Weibo fans is also visibly decreasing, and has become 17,209.\n\n\n\n  In just half a day, more than 70 people have unfollowed him.\n\n\n\n  Converted, that's more than 7,000 yuan!\n\n\n\n  The effect is immediate.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi couldn't help but smile, completely relieved.\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  \"Creak\"\n\n\n\n  The dormitory door opened, Wang Cheng and Sun Xingzhou walked in, laughing and joking, Liu Yu who followed behind seemed a little unhappy.\n\n\n\n  \"Oh, Brother Qi, you're awake, did you drink too much last night, are you okay?\"\n\n\n\n  Sun Xingzhou greeted him, then sat down on the edge of Guo Qi's bed, pointing at Wang Cheng and said with a laugh, \"It's so funny, let me tell you, we were having dinner just now, Brother Cheng did something big again.\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi heard it and knew that Wang Cheng's old problem had recurred.\n\n\n\n  He is a warm-hearted person, he is great to his friends, but sometimes his EQ is lacking, like a straight stick.\n\n\n\n  Because of this, he has made many jokes.\n\n\n\n  When he just entered university, Wang Cheng became famous for successfully calling someone to break the lock after locking his keys in the storage cabinet.\n\n\n\n  Not long after, when they went to the dormitory to get hot water, Wang Cheng tried many faucets but none of them worked, and finally, after several people checked for a long time, they found that this guy had been pressing his ID card on the faucet as a water card.\n\n\n\n  Since then, Brother Cheng's name spread far and wide.\n\n\n\n  In his junior year, because of his honesty, trustworthiness and warm-heartedness, Wang Cheng had a girlfriend for a short time.\n\n\n\n  One day a few months later, because the girl suggested watching a movie which delayed their time, they found the dormitory door locked when they returned from their date.  The girl hinted, what do we do, it seems we have to go to a hotel to sleep, Brother Cheng, don't take advantage of me.\n\n\n\n  Brother Cheng patted his chest and said domineeringly to his girlfriend, Don't worry, a man should protect a woman from wind and rain, I can still handle this little thing?\n\n\n\n  Then, under the girl's mysterious and magical gaze, he went over and knocked on the dorm aunt's door \"bang bang\".......\n\n\n\n  My Brother Cheng is such a straightforward person.\n\n\n\n  Seeing Liu Yu's helpless look, Guo Qi understood, and asked with a raised eyebrow, \"Xingzhou, what did Brother Cheng do to Liu Yu?\"\n\n\n\n  \"Hahaha, the three of us were having dinner in the cafeteria just now, Liu Yu liked the girl lining up next to us, and went up to chat her up. He pretended to have forgotten his meal card, and wanted to use the girl's card and then transfer the money to her via WeChat.\"\n\n\n\n  Sun Xingzhou vividly described it: \"Actually, this kid just wanted her WeChat account, that girl didn't know if she was really stupid or had some interest in Liu Yu, she nodded and agreed.\"\n\n\n\n  \"At that moment, Brother Cheng stepped forward, grabbed Liu Yu.....hahaha.......and pulled him away.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Brother Cheng is really too much, whoa!\"\n\n\n\n  Liu Yu, seeing Sun Xingzhou laughing happily, his mood eased a little, and he scolded with a laugh, \"The key is that this guy pulled me while saying, Brother Yu, everyone is here, how can we trouble outsiders, this meal is on me.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Do I need this meal? What I need is a girlfriend!\"\n\n\n\n  Several people burst into laughter.\n\n\n\n  Wang Cheng on the side scratched his head and said embarrassedly, \"Oh, it's just a girlfriend, Brother Qi, I'll compensate you for one another day. Come on, everyone is here, let's play games together.\"\n\n\n\n  Several people responded, and the dormitory was immediately filled with the pleasant sound of keyboard tapping, and occasionally interspersed with a few words.\n\n\n\n  \"Launch an attack!\"\n\n\n\n  \"Whoa, there's an ambush!\"\n\n\n\n  \"Fall back to the high ground!\"\n\n\n\n  \"Hold on, we can win!\"\n\n\n\n  ......."

    "content": "四個人當中，劉宇最強，屬於打野大爹。\n\n\n孫興洲和郭齊實力在中上游，偶爾經濟刷起來也能carry那種。而王成則是那種自以為在carry，其實是團滅發動機。\n\n\n而且他根本不知道什麼叫出裝思路，永遠都是系統推薦出裝，對面即便沒有法師，王成也依然會購買魔抗斗篷和韌性鞋。\n\n\n根據遊戲界的恆定原則，最菜的永遠是發言最多的。\n\n\n看到水晶再一次綻放成燦爛煙花，王成首先嘆口氣。\n\n\n「唉，兄弟們還要多練練，跟上我的節奏啊。不要每次我上去你們輸出跟不上來。」\n\n\n「成哥你一個人抓對面五個落單，兄弟們吃屎的勁兒都用了也跟不上。」\n\n\n「哎，這一把成哥輸出3.9%，但凡有一點走位失誤。輸出也不會這麼低吧。」\n\n\n王成：「？？？？」\n\n\n我走位還是太完美了？？？\n\n\n........\n\n\n開黑的時間，總是快樂而短暫。\n\n\n已經六點多鐘，布魯斯酒吧演出馬上就要開始了。\n\n\n雖然酒吧老闆的態度不是很好，但考慮到此刻略顯羞澀的錢包，郭齊關上電腦，背起吉他朝酒吧街走去。\n\n\n江大位於江州市區繁華地帶，旁邊蜿蜒而過的就是江州母親河—大瀾江。\n\n\n本市頗具盛名的酒吧街就與江大隔江相望。\n\n\n由於周邊分布著幾個大學校區，加上慕名而至的文藝遊客，酒吧街常年人流熙熙攘攘，生意非常火爆。\n\n\n和其他地方的酒吧街類似，最熱鬧的往往是當街幾家歌舞廳似的鬧吧。炫目的廉價燈光配合著擠壓耳膜的動詞打次音響，將舞池中的荷爾蒙縱情釋放。\n\n\n布魯斯酒吧，就是這種鬧吧旁邊小角落裡的靜吧。\n\n\n老闆楊大力，年輕時候曾是個文藝背包客，留著長發身著長衫，衣衫飄飄的睡過全國各文藝聖地的姑娘。後來年齡太大浪不動了，就回到江州盤下了這麼個小酒吧。\n\n\n平心而論，楊大力性格還是蠻不錯的。\n\n\n雖然今天他給郭齊發消息時，語氣並不是太好。但那因為本月剛過一半，原來的郭齊就以自己被唱片公司拒絕心情不好為由，鴿了他老楊足足五次。\n\n\n如果不是這小子自帶粉絲，吸引了不少顧客常駐此地，老楊豈會跟他如此嘰歪？\n\n\n早就讓郭齊滾犢子了。\n\n\n今天是布魯斯酒館的周五狂歡夜，全場酒水限時八折。即便如此，布魯斯的上座率也並不高，只有一半左右。\n\n\n楊大力搖搖頭，電話確認郭齊在來的路上以後，轉身走進了吧檯。\n\n\n顧客之中接近小半是妙齡少女，楊大力認得這些老面孔，應該都是附近大學的學生，算是郭齊的粉絲。\n\n\n有的是顏粉，大部分是樂粉。\n\n\n晚上八點，\n\n\n郭齊沒有食言，準時來到了布魯斯，設備已經調好擺在舞台中間。\n\n\n雖然原主舞台表演經驗豐富，但對現在的郭齊來說，還是大姑娘上轎——頭一遭。還好記憶中的表演經驗讓他不至於怯場，郭齊在路上也嘗試唱了幾嗓子。\n\n\n嗯，功力還在。\n\n\n「各位朋友，大家晚上好，我是小齊，希望你們會喜歡我的音樂，謝謝。」\n\n\n簡單開口暖了暖場，充滿磁性的聲音頓時讓氣氛變得活躍起來。\n\n\n輕咳幾聲，郭齊抱著吉他掃了掃弦。\n\n\n溫柔的歌聲響起，這是一首來自郭齊的原創作品《不見了的人》。\n\n\n詞/郭齊\n\n\n曲/郭齊\n\n\n曾經陪著我的那個人\n\n\n逐漸消失在那個黃昏\n\n\n從我生命里消失的那個人\n\n\n本以為再無遇見的緣分\n\n\n一直未曾對你說聲謝謝\n\n\n至少給過我那樣的陪伴\n\n\n那樣的溫暖\n\n\n......\n\n\n......\n\n\n說實話，詞曲都有很大的進步空間，還好台下觀眾口味並不刁鑽，反響依然十分熱烈。\n\n\n現在的郭齊是不喜歡這種歌的，但是拿人手短，每場300的酬勞也還算良心，也就耐住性子，繼續唱的深情款款。\n\n\n一連唱了幾首，既有成名作曲的翻唱，也有個人作品的原唱，酒館氣氛越來越熱。\n\n\n接近尾聲時，郭齊開始今晚壓軸曲目，也是他的原創，粉絲們呼聲最高的《夏日稻香》。\n\n\n這首歌有部分借鑑成分，但整體質量和完成度都比較高，除了女粉絲之外，也有部分男粉絲因為這首歌而關注了郭齊。\n\n\nR&amp;B風格輕快的旋律，讓人聽著就仿佛聞到了稻田的味道、稻穗的氣息、蕃茄的滋味：自己與伴侶手拉手漫步在稻田之畔，頭上是絲絲白雲的藍天，迎面吹來芳香的微風......\n\n\n跟隨著吉他旋律，現場還有幾個人一起哼唱起來。\n\n\n兼職燈光師的楊大力，此刻也神魔附體，打出了這輩子最到好處的舞檯燈光，光芒映在郭齊臉上，仿佛玉石打造的雕塑。\n\n\n台下有人拿起手機記錄這難得的瞬間。\n\n\n幾個膽兒大放得開的女生，也捧著酒杯和螢光貼跑到了台上。\n\n\n螢光貼上，寫滿了支持郭齊的話語。\n\n\n「給我們最好的小齊！」\n\n\n「愛你，小齊，我們會在CAPO永遠支持你！」\n\n\n「《夏日稻香》今年必火！」\n\n\n......\n\n\n「這首歌真好聽，求CAPO號，求微博！」台下有位姑娘大聲喊。\n\n\n聞聽此言，郭齊臉色刷的一變，還沒來得及想怎麼拒絕。\n\n\n剛才上台送酒的熱心粉絲已經開始安利：「大家快去搜：追夢的小齊，多多支持呀。」\n\n\n話音未落，台下好幾人低頭拿起手機，看樣子是在尋找關注了。\n\n\n臥槽！！！\n\n\n知道粉絲是好意，郭齊心中媽賣批，臉上只能笑嘻嘻。\n\n\n他摘下吉他，鞠躬致謝：「謝謝大家的喜歡，我是小齊，請多多支持。」\n\n\n走到酒吧後台，郭齊不禁皺起眉頭。\n\n\n這是個隱患吶！\n\n\n原以為酒館的觀眾都是普通遊客，想不到還有些是他的粉絲，僅僅是顏粉也就罷了，竟然還有人因為音樂而粉他。\n\n\n雖然數量不多，但1個人是100塊，100個人就是10000塊。萬一他們再推薦給身邊的親戚朋友，損失只會更大。\n\n\n看現場的反應，已經有粉絲為他製作應援螢光貼了，這種擔心並不多餘，\n\n\n甚至還很必要！\n\n\n郭齊是個謹慎的人。\n\n\n寧可殺錯，不可放過。\n\n\n按照簽約約定，除了周五晚上，周日晚上郭齊也要來布魯斯駐唱。\n\n\n《夏日稻香》是萬萬不能再唱了，得更換曲目！\n\n\n臨時原創不太現實，從前世記憶中找幾首歌翻唱更靠譜一些。\n\n\n只是，翻唱哪首呢？\n\n\n前世那些傳唱度高的經典曲目，郭齊自然是不會拿出來的，畢竟經典就是經典，很容易就火上去了。\n\n\n要想掉粉，最好唱一首演唱者可以自嗨而風格又十分小眾不能被廣泛接受的一首歌，最好還有點惡搞。\n\n\n比如各種神曲。\n\n\n《老鼠愛大米》？\n\n\n《萬物生》？\n\n\n不行，風險也不低。\n\n\n郭齊搖搖頭，否決了腦海中閃過的幾首歌。畢竟在某個階段，這些歌曲都曾準確命中過大眾市場的音樂需求，從而引領了風潮。\n\n\n萬一，這次又命中了呢？\n\n\n得想個靠譜一點的......\n\n\n郭齊琢磨半天，腦海中突然冒出一首歌來。\n\n\n「就是你了！」\n\n\n郭齊一拍大腿，激動說道。\n\n\n他信心十足，此曲一出，不僅不會新增粉絲，就連原有的樂粉很可能也會因此流失。\n\n\n......."

    "content": "敲定曲目，郭齊趕緊跑去吧檯，和老楊提前報備。\n\n\n\n  老楊對音樂風格向來不挑剔，雖然聽名字就不像什么正經歌，但看郭齊一副信心滿滿的模樣，也就同意了。\n\n\n\n  與此同時，酒館中某個安靜的角落，兩個面容姣好的女生相對而坐。\n\n\n\n  其中一個年紀尚輕，看起來是大學生，另一位身穿黑色短T，看上去精明幹練是位職場人士。\n\n\n\n  「雲朵，這就是你要我看的那個歌手？」\n\n\n\n  叫雲朵的年輕女子點頭道：「是呀，郭齊是我們學校的校園十佳，颱風也很不錯吧，長得也帥。顧棠姐，你覺得怎麼樣嘛？」\n\n\n\n  「長得還可以，歌也還可以，但是嘛.......」\n\n\n\n  顧棠搖了搖頭：「我不看好他，太普通了，沒什麼特色。最後那首歌還可以，但似乎有些借鑑成分。」\n\n\n\n  「這樣哦，」賈雲朵有點為郭齊惋惜，她知道顧棠向來是個很有主見的人，但還是忍不住多勸了一句。\n\n\n\n  「也可能是狀態還沒完全對，周日的時候郭齊還會來表演，顧棠姐有時間的話，就再給一次機會咯。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯，周日再說吧。」\n\n\n\n  顧棠輕輕晃了晃酒杯，半杯酒一飲而盡。\n\n\n\n  ...... \n\n\n\n  還好酒館和江大距離很近，回寢室的時候已經快11點了。舍友們都沒睡，面對電腦激戰正酣。\n\n\n\n  「齊哥，來一起開黑啊。」王成發出熱情邀約。\n\n\n\n  「嗓子不舒服，今天先不戰了。」\n\n\n\n  郭齊倒在床上，拿出手機開始查看微博戰況。\n\n\n\n  臥槽！\n\n\n\n  看了眼數據，郭齊忍不住欣喜出聲！\n\n\n\n  效果拔群！\n\n\n\n  旗開得勝！\n\n\n\n  才半天功夫，這條微博的瀏覽量已經高達5萬，評論數超出200+，而且都是差評居多。\n\n\n\n  「給我點讚的明年都能發財」\n\n\n\n  「求別贊，上次發了個騷話，微博響了兩個月。。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵，帥哥美女都是假的。」\n\n\n\n  「博主為何要擊碎幻想？」\n\n\n\n  「還我帥氣小齊」\n\n\n\n  「生活中果然都是普通人。」\n\n\n\n  .....\n\n\n\n  看了眼關注人數，已經降至16126了，足足損失了1162個粉絲，考慮到今晚酒館引了幾個粉，真實的視頻掉粉量還會更高。\n\n\n\n  換算成系統獎勵，那就是近12萬元！ \n\n\n\n  一天賺了12萬，是何等的體驗？\n\n\n\n  郭齊大受鼓舞。\n\n\n\n  金錢的力量是偉大的。\n\n\n\n  第二天是周六，通常睡到日上三竿的郭齊，早早起床查看微博的掉粉進度。\n\n\n\n  經過一天的發酵，微博瀏覽量新增已經放緩，最後停在了8萬左右的位置，掉粉效果也大大減弱。\n\n\n\n  總共掉了1386個，\n\n\n\n  還剩15902。\n\n\n\n  這些堅守的釘子戶粉絲，很頑強啊。\n\n\n\n  仔細查看了後台數據，郭齊發現，其實視頻的掉粉效果是大於1386的，但奇怪的是，竟然還有100多個人因為這個視頻關注了他。\n\n\n\n  怎麼，難道真有人審美品味獨特，就喜歡關注丑的？\n\n\n\n  不過，這些人終歸是小眾，和掉粉數量比起來，新增數完全不值一提。\n\n\n\n  郭齊雖然謹慎，也沒把這個放在心上。\n\n\n\n  上條視頻的效果已經逐漸趨於微弱，需要趁熱打鐵，再多出幾期類似的視頻，形成對顏粉心理的持續性打壓。\n\n\n\n  上條視頻雖然優秀，但也不是沒有進步空間。\n\n\n\n  比如，場景化。\n\n\n\n  單純的妝容和素顏比對，雖然衝擊力足夠，但缺乏代入感。 \n\n\n\n  如果引入用戶經常面對的場景，比如相親，比如網戀奔現，就能讓觀眾產生更強的代入感。\n\n\n\n  舉個例子，你自己被女朋友綠了，和你朋友被女朋友綠了，內心感受截然不同。\n\n\n\n  前者你只想砍了那個小三，後者你可以拿出雞湯語錄進行安慰。\n\n\n\n  所以，要對照騙們造成的惡行進行場景化描述。讓更多的粉絲感同身受，從而產生憤怒。\n\n\n\n  另外還有個問題，沒有人設。\n\n\n\n  上期視頻內容雖然暴露了素顏，但卻沒有暴露其他的人物特色，也就難以引發粉絲更大的厭惡。\n\n\n\n  試想，如果視頻中的郭齊，不僅照騙，還不尊重女性，是不是就會引發更大憤慨了呢？\n\n\n\n  為了防止系統認定故意自我抹黑，郭齊打算在視頻中標註【內容純屬虛構創作】，這樣所有的人設就是視頻情節了，系統也說不出什麼。\n\n\n\n  對上期視頻復盤之後，郭齊隨即開工，在CAPO上開始新一期內容的製作。\n\n\n\n  這一次，他籌劃了更細緻的劇本，還請了舍友做友情客串。\n\n\n\n  首先，視頻長度定在了2分鐘，這樣大部分人都有耐心看完。\n\n\n\n  其次，劇情一定要狗血，讓人感覺編劇腦子有問題或者是自己智商受到了侮辱，總之，現實生活中絕對不可能會發生。 \n\n\n\n  最後，劇情結局一定要反轉，最好是喚起人的反感情緒，堅決不能讓觀眾爽。\n\n\n\n  萬一爽了之後，反手就是點讚關注，豈不是虧大了？\n\n\n\n  這次的工作量更大，即便有CAPO的幫助，郭齊也花了接近一天的時間。\n\n\n\n  最終成品出來時，已經快下午六點了。\n\n\n\n  「呼，累死我了。」\n\n\n\n  長出一口氣，郭齊迫不及待的點擊播放，瀏覽最終效果。\n\n\n\n  視頻大概是是這樣的。\n\n\n\n  少女小A(劉宇飾）在路邊，羞澀的等待自己的網戀對象，照片顯示，對方是一位帥氣英俊的男孩（郭齊微博上的帥照)。\n\n\n\n  正等待時，路邊走過來少女小B(孫興洲飾)，她騎著自行車(王成飾)而來，問道：「嗨，你就是果味VC嗎？」\n\n\n\n  小A非常慌張，急忙問道：「我是，難道你是白馬非馬，你怎麼會是個女生？」\n\n\n\n  小B停好車笑了，此處應王成要求，給自行車一個特寫。\n\n\n\n  小B說道：「別誤會，我是替我弟過來的。他終於有人要了，我先過來看看，見面打起來他能不能打得過。」\n\n\n\n  小A把手機上的帥氣照片伸過去，疑惑問道：「你弟這麼帥，怎麼會被人打呢？」 \n\n\n\n  小B看了眼，驚訝道：「臥槽，這TM是誰？」\n\n\n\n  然後在BGM中，郭齊閃亮出場。\n\n\n\n  在CAPO素材和濾鏡效果下，他把自己變成一位容貌普通膚色暗沉的醜男子——小齊。\n\n\n\n  小A捂嘴驚訝：「臥槽，你TM是誰？」\n\n\n\n  為了增加狗血感，結尾是郭齊用變聲器製作的畫外音。\n\n\n\n  「我叫小齊，沒想到我網戀還是成功了，小A告訴我，雖然我很醜，但我拉開法拉利車門的動作真的很帥，她發現了愛情。」\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  「嗯，不錯。」\n\n\n\n  比上一個視頻更令人印象深刻。\n\n\n\n  結尾還順帶諷刺了某些拜金現象，想必會讓很多綠茶們非常厭惡吧。\n\n\n\n  郭齊很滿意。\n\n\n\n  編輯了一個做作的標題【小姐姐，網戀嗎？我照片超甜】，同樣沒有選擇話題標籤，也沒有寫視頻簡介。\n\n\n\n  點擊上傳，然後關閉微博後台，郭齊起身出去覓食。\n\n\n\n  忙碌了一天，此刻的他早已是飢腸轆轆。\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  晚上十點半。\n\n\n\n  千里之外的京州，新潮微博辦公樓，短視頻項目部剛剛結束部門會議。 \n\n\n\n  番茄網和拍拍秀場兩個軟體的快速崛起，引發了各大網際網路公司和資本對視頻社區的熱情。\n\n\n\n  作為目前傳媒領域的佼佼者，新潮微博也不甘落後，迅速採取行動，上線了視頻社區模塊。\n\n\n\n  「接下來一年，我們將持續投入十個億，鼓勵優質內容創作者，投身到咱們新潮微博平台進行創作。」\n\n\n\n  短視頻項目負責人，集團VP之一的楊淵，剛剛在會議上正式表態，確定將生活娛樂等五個頻道作為重點突破方向，並給予流量入口。\n\n\n\n  身為短視頻部門生活娛樂頻道的頻道編輯，周白感覺自己責任重大，對工作也有著異常充沛的熱情。\n\n\n\n  只是每個公司都自帶基因，番茄網是靠著動漫新番剪輯和鬼畜剪輯火起來的，拍拍秀場是做經典影視片段演繹火起來的，這二者做視頻有天然的用戶基礎。\n\n\n\n  而新潮微博，是靠圖文段子起家，除明星之外，大火的博主大V基本都是圖文高手，視頻創作者比較少見。\n\n\n\n  還要多引導挖掘啊。\n\n\n\n  周白登陸後台，開始查看數據。\n\n\n\n  這兩天，他在重點推廣話題#你對網戀一無所知#，需要時刻追隨進度。\n\nAfter confirming the song list, Guo Qi quickly ran to the bar to inform Lao Yang in advance.\n\n\n  Lao Yang has always been undemanding about music styles. Although the name didn't sound like a decent song, seeing Guo Qi's confident look, he agreed.\n\n\n  Meanwhile, in a quiet corner of the bar, two pretty girls sat facing each other.\n\n\n  One was young, looking like a college student; the other, wearing a black short T-shirt, looked shrewd and capable, a professional.\n\n\n  \"Yunduo, is this the singer you wanted me to see?\"\n\n\n  The young woman named Yunduo nodded: \"Yes, Guo Qi is one of the top ten students in our school, and his stage presence is pretty good. He's handsome too.  Gu Tang jie, what do you think?\"\n\n\n  \"He's alright-looking, and his singing is alright too, but…\"\n\n\n  Gu Tang shook her head: \"I'm not optimistic about him. He's too ordinary, lacks personality. The last song was okay, but it seems to have borrowed some elements.\"\n\n\n  \"Oh,\" Jia Yunduo felt a little sorry for Guo Qi. She knew Gu Tang was always a strong-willed person, but she couldn't help but persuade her further.\n\n\n  \"Maybe he wasn't in the right state. Guo Qi will perform again on Sunday. If you have time, Gu Tang jie, give him another chance.\"\n\n\n  \"Mm, let's talk on Sunday.\"\n\n\n  Gu Tang gently swirled her wine glass, draining half the glass in one gulp.\n\n\n  …\n\n\n  Luckily, the bar was close to Jiangda University. It was almost 11 o'clock when he got back to the dorm. His roommates were still awake, intensely engaged in a computer game.\n\n\n  \"Brother Qi, come join us for a game!\" Wang Cheng enthusiastically invited.\n\n\n  \"My throat hurts, I'll skip it today.\"\n\n\n  Guo Qi fell onto the bed, took out his phone, and started checking his Weibo.\n\n\n  Whoa!\n\n\n  After glancing at the data, Guo Qi couldn't help but exclaim with joy!\n\n\n  Amazing effect!\n\n\n  A winning start!\n\n\n  In just half a day, the Weibo post's views had reached 50,000, with over 200 comments, mostly negative reviews.\n\n\n  \"Anyone who likes this will get rich next year!\"\n\n\n  \"Please don't like this, I posted some nonsense last time and my Weibo blew up for two months…\"\n\n\n  \"Haha, handsome guys and beautiful girls are all fake.\"\n\n\n  \"Why did the blogger shatter my illusions?\"\n\n\n  \"Give me back my handsome Xiao Qi!\"\n\n\n  \"Life is full of ordinary people.\"\n\n\n  …\n\n\n  He checked the number of followers, it had dropped to 16,126, a loss of 1,162 followers. Considering the few fans gained at the bar tonight, the actual loss from the video would be even higher.\n\n\n  Converted into system rewards, that's nearly 120,000 yuan!\n\n\n  What's it like to earn 120,000 yuan in a day?\n\n\n  Guo Qi was greatly encouraged.\n\n\n  The power of money is great.\n\n\n  The next day was Saturday. Guo Qi, who usually slept until noon, woke up early to check the progress of his Weibo follower loss.\n\n\n  After a day of fermentation, the increase in Weibo views had slowed down, finally stopping at around 80,000, and the effect of losing followers had also greatly weakened.\n\n\n  A total of 1,386 followers were lost,\n\n\n  leaving 15,902.\n\n\n  These die-hard fans are tenacious.\n\n\n  After carefully checking the backend data, Guo Qi found that the actual effect of losing followers from the video was greater than 1,386, but strangely, more than 100 people had followed him because of this video.\n\n\n  What? Is there really someone with unique aesthetic taste who likes to follow ugly people?\n\n\n  However, these people were ultimately a small minority. Compared to the number of lost followers, the number of new followers was insignificant.\n\n\n  Although Guo Qi was cautious, he didn't take this to heart.\n\n\n  The effect of the previous video was gradually weakening, and he needed to strike while the iron was hot, produce several more similar videos, and create a continuous suppression of the fans' aesthetic psychology.\n\n\n  The previous video was excellent, but it was not without room for improvement.\n\n\n  For example, scenario-based settings.\n\n\n  The simple comparison of makeup and bare faces, while impactful enough, lacked immersion.\n\n\n  If introducing scenarios users often face, such as blind dates, or online dating meeting in person, it could create a stronger sense of immersion for the audience.\n\n\n  For example, the feeling of being cheated on by your girlfriend is completely different from the feeling of your friend being cheated on.\n\n\n  In the former, you just want to kill the other woman, and in the latter, you can offer some chicken soup phrases for comfort.\n\n\n  Therefore, the evil deeds caused by deceptive photos should be described in a scenario-based way. Let more fans empathize and thus generate anger.\n\n\n  There's another problem: lack of character settings.\n\n\n  Although the previous video revealed his bare face, it didn't reveal other personal characteristics, making it difficult to arouse greater disgust among fans.\n\n\n  Imagine, if Guo Qi in the video was not only a deceptive photo, but also disrespectful to women, wouldn't it cause even greater indignation?\n\n\n  To prevent the system from identifying it as intentional self-denigration, Guo Qi planned to label the video with 【The content is purely fictional】, so that all the character settings are just the plot of the video, and the system can't say anything.\n\n\n  After reviewing the previous video, Guo Qi immediately started work, creating new content on CAPO.\n\n\n  This time, he planned a more detailed script and even invited his roommates for a cameo appearance.\n\n\n  First, the video length was set at 2 minutes, so that most people would have the patience to watch it.\n\n\n  Second, the plot must be sensational, making people feel that the screenwriter has a problem with his brain or that their IQ has been insulted; in short, it is absolutely impossible to happen in real life.\n\n\n  Finally, the ending of the plot must be a reversal, preferably one that evokes negative emotions in people and absolutely cannot make the audience feel satisfied.\n\n\n  If they're satisfied, they'll immediately like and follow, wouldn't that be a huge loss?\n\n\n  This time the workload was larger. Even with the help of CAPO, Guo Qi spent almost a day.\n\n\n  When the final product came out, it was almost six o'clock in the afternoon.\n\n\n  \"Whew, I'm exhausted.\"\n\n\n  Taking a deep breath, Guo Qi eagerly clicked play and reviewed the final effect.\n\n\n  The video is roughly as follows:\n\n\n  Girl A (Liu Yu) is waiting shyly by the roadside for her online dating partner. The photo shows him as a handsome and dashing boy (Guo Qi's handsome photo on Weibo).\n\n\n  As she is waiting, Girl B (Sun Xingzhou) comes cycling (Wang Cheng) and asks: \"Hi, are you Guo Wei VC?\"\n\n\n  Girl A is very flustered and hurriedly asks: \"I am, are you Bai Ma Fei Ma? Why are you a girl?\"\n\n\n  Girl B parks her bike and smiles. At Wang Cheng's request, a close-up of the bicycle is shown.\n\n\n  Girl B says: \"Don't get me wrong, I'm here for my brother. He finally has someone, so I came to take a look first, to see if he can fight if they meet and start fighting.\"\n\n\n  Girl A shows the handsome photo on her phone and asks questioningly: \"Your brother is so handsome, how could he get beaten up?\"\n\n\n  Girl B takes a look and exclaims: \"Whoa, who the hell is this?\"\n\n\n  Then, to the sound of BGM, Guo Qi makes a grand entrance.\n\n\n  With CAPO's materials and filter effects, he transforms himself into an ordinary-looking, dull-complexioned ugly man—Xiao Qi.\n\n\n  Girl A covers her mouth in surprise: \"Whoa, who the hell are you?\"\n\n\n  To increase the sensationalism, the ending features a voice-over created by Guo Qi using a voice changer.\n\n\n  \"My name is Xiao Qi, I didn't expect my online dating to be successful, Girl A told me that although I'm ugly, my action of opening the Ferrari door is really handsome. She has found love.\"\n\n\n  …\n\n\n  \"Mm, not bad.\"\n\n\n  More impressive than the last video.\n\n\n  The ending also satirizes certain materialistic phenomena, which will surely make many green tea girls very disgusted.\n\n\n  Guo Qi was very satisfied.\n\n\n  He edited a pretentious title: 【Girl, online dating? My photos are super sweet】, and as before, he did not choose topic tags or write a video introduction.\n\n\n  He clicked upload, then closed the Weibo backend, and Guo Qi got up to go find food.\n\n\n  After a busy day, he was already famished.\n\n\n  …\n\n\n  Ten-thirty in the evening.\n\n\n  Thousands of miles away in Jingzhou, at the Xinchao Weibo office building, the short video department had just finished its department meeting.\n\n\n  The rapid rise of the Tomato Network and PaiPai Show software has ignited the enthusiasm of major internet companies and capital for video communities.\n\n\n  As a leader in the current media field, Xinchao Weibo is not to be outdone. It quickly took action and launched a video community module.\n\n\n  \"In the next year, we will continue to invest one billion yuan to encourage high-quality content creators to participate in the creation on our Xinchao Weibo platform.\"\n\n\n  Yang Yuan, the head of the short video project and one of the group's VPs, officially announced this at the meeting, confirming that five channels, including life and entertainment, will be prioritized and given traffic access.\n\n\n  As the channel editor for the life and entertainment channel in the short video department, Zhou Bai felt a great responsibility and had unusually high enthusiasm for his work.\n\n\n  However, every company has its own genes.

    "content": "事情的起因，是一篇狗血新聞報導。\n\n\n\n  《化妝術還是易容術，小伙婚後第二天狀告新娘詐騙》\n\n\n\n  這原本只是一條普通的翻車新聞，可能是第一次有人狀告到法院，也可能只是網友們太無聊了。\n\n\n\n  總之，這條新聞火了。\n\n\n\n  媒體紛紛報導，該話題趁機一舉攻占了微博熱搜榜以及番茄榜熱區。\n\n\n\n  直到領導們收到監管消息，使用算法降低了部分該話題熱度，這才把網友的討論熱情壓了下來。\n\n\n\n  雖然新聞熱度下去了，網友積極性卻依然高漲。\n\n\n\n  在番茄網和咖啡秀場等視頻社區的推動下，新聞相關衍生話題的熱度迅速沖高，吸引了很多參與者。\n\n\n\n  番茄網今日最熱話題，有兩個與此相關，分別為：「看我七十二變」和「大型網戀奔現現場」。\n\n\n\n  前者鼓勵各路美妝大神曬出自己的各種妝容視頻，後者鼓勵大家曬出網戀的各種經歷，不乏很多翻車經歷。\n\n\n\n  咖啡秀場今日演繹榜第一，是「我到底長啥樣。」\n\n\n\n  主要是網友剪輯的明星們在不同場合顏值忽高忽低，也有部分網紅趁機跟隨進來。\n\n\n\n  作為社交媒體中的頭把交椅，新潮微博自然不能落後於人。周白也是發動同事一起運作，將話題「你對網戀一無所知」放在了主頁推薦話題。 \n\n\n\n  從網友參與度來看，這個話題是相當成功的。角度切入的很準，不僅僅局限在美妝或者娛樂領域。\n\n\n\n  大家紛紛跟隨話題，發揮聰明才智，貢獻了一個個膾炙人口的段子。\n\n\n\n  @是騾子是馬拉出來溜溜:【網戀禁忌】第一、真人不露相的決不要談；第二、要談就永遠別露面。\n\n\n\n  @小小飯糰：網戀請選我，全網無前任，有也不承認，我綠你可以，你綠我死媽，365張假照，你喜歡的樣子我都有。\n\n\n\n  @大大古巨基:別輕易網戀，你永遠不知道屏幕對面是誰，有可能......是你爹！\n\n\n\n  @追夢少年小火龍：那些年網戀教會我的事【長圖文】\n\n\n\n  @我是可愛純啊：我真的被網戀對象欺騙過，當時還......\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  話題閱讀數迅速破千萬，討論人數已經有好幾千。\n\n\n\n  但是，視頻內容寥寥無幾。\n\n\n\n  「哎，現在的新潮微博，視頻基因哈，還是太弱了。」\n\n\n\n  周白長嘆一聲，繼續瀏覽後台數據。\n\n\n\n  老闆們已經選擇生活娛樂頻道率先發力，周白決定借著本次話題，對視頻創作再加大些引導。\n\n\n\n  搜索了「網戀」關鍵詞，一則油膩的標題喚起了周白的興趣。 \n\n\n\n  【小姐姐，網戀嗎？我超甜】\n\n\n\n  博主擁有一萬多粉絲，應該有一定的內容製作經驗，視頻只有兩分鐘，花不了太多時間。\n\n\n\n  周白點開視頻。\n\n\n\n  開場是一個少女在等待網戀情郎的到來，應該是經費有限，這個少女竟然是魁梧大漢所扮演。\n\n\n\n  再往下看，\n\n\n\n  連自行車都是由人扮演的。\n\n\n\n  這也太敷衍觀眾了吧？\n\n\n\n  周白峰忍不住吐槽。\n\n\n\n  不過結合主題來看，這種沙雕敷衍風格竟毫無違和感。\n\n\n\n  繼續往下看。\n\n\n\n  當視頻中小B說出那句：「臥槽，這TM是誰？」\n\n\n\n  周白不由得笑出聲來。\n\n\n\n  最後的結尾也非常巧妙，既通過反轉增加了趣味，也諷刺了網戀中的拜金現象。\n\n\n\n  看了眼博主數據，周白心中奇怪：視頻質量是不錯的，數據怎麼這麼慘澹？\n\n\n\n  尤其是粉絲數，竟然是快速流失的。\n\n\n\n  昨天流失了1300多，今天晚上剛發布，粉絲雖然有新增10+，整體卻再度流失100多。\n\n\n\n  這是什麼原因？ \n\n\n\n  這個問題不找出來，很可能就會打擊這位博主的視頻創作熱情！\n\n\n\n  想到這，周白嚴肅起來。\n\n\n\n  耗費近一個小時，反覆比對同層級帳號的主頁內容和粉絲標籤後，他終於有了答案。\n\n\n\n  從粉絲人群標籤來看，這位博主流失的都是娛樂向粉絲，也就是顏粉或者才藝粉之類的，更關注博主的顏值才藝。\n\n\n\n  而這兩天新增的粉絲，標籤都是生活搞笑向，更關注博主的內容劇情。\n\n\n\n  大概是視頻創作經驗少，這位名為「追夢的小齊」的博主，上傳新視頻時犯了很多新手常見的錯誤，沒有視頻描述，也沒選話題標籤。\n\n\n\n  這就導致原有粉絲無法接受素顏效果，而喜歡這類劇情內容的粉絲又沒有被系統推薦過來\n\n\n\n  也就導致了掉粉。\n\n\n\n  看博主的用戶評價也印證了這個判斷，周白鬆口氣。\n\n\n\n  辛苦創作的視頻引起大量掉粉，想必這位博主也很著急，這才趕緊補充了第二期內容。\n\n\n\n  只是方向錯了，再努力也是無用。\n\n\n\n  若非遇到自己，只怕這一期視頻依然起不到好效果。\n\n\n\n  正常情況下，頻道編輯是不能隨意利用手中權限影響帳號流量的。但周白作為熱點話題主持人，是有權裝修頁面以及設置置頂內容的，只需後台報備即可。 \n\n\n\n  目前「你對網戀一無所知」話題下優質視頻內容不多，而這個視頻和主題也十分契合，所以......\n\n\n\n  沒有絲毫猶豫，\n\n\n\n  周白將郭齊的視頻設為置頂，並且還貼心的為視頻增加了幾個話題引流標籤。\n\n\n\n  沒一會兒，\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦」\n\n\n\n  話題內的流量涌了進來。\n\n\n\n  由於受眾契合，視頻的評論數和轉發數迅速增加，並且有相當比例轉化為郭齊的粉絲。\n\n\n\n  周白拿起養生壺，沖泡了一杯咖啡。想像著博主看到後台數據的反應，他心中充盈著滿滿的成就感。\n\n\n\n  贈人玫瑰，手有餘香。\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  第二天。\n\n\n\n  郭齊在床上悠然醒轉，看了看表，已經快十點了。\n\n\n\n  困意還未完全消退，郭齊決定再小憩那麼一會兒，養養精神。昨天製作視頻忙活整天，對精力是很大的消耗。\n\n\n\n  今晚布魯斯酒吧演出，就要啟動新曲目了，排練要認真準備下，爭取達到最佳的粉絲勸退效果。\n\n\n\n  至於勸退粉絲的後續影響，郭齊也不是很在意。\n\n\n\n  按照現在的掉粉趨勢，等系統結算完，郭齊手頭少說也有幾十萬的現金，即便酒館不解約，郭齊也不打算去駐唱了。 \n\n\n\n  到時候找個風景秀麗的地方，舒舒服服度個假，然後再利用穿越優勢，用手頭的錢搞搞投資，做個快樂的富家翁。\n\n\n\n  想到這，郭齊美滋滋的喚醒手機屏幕。\n\n\n\n  滿屏的微博消息提示，讓他心底不由得咯噔一下，腦海中浮現某些不好的預感。\n\n\n\n  穩住，\n\n\n\n  不要慌，\n\n\n\n  可能是視頻效果太好，粉絲取關提示太多了。\n\n\n\n  郭齊安慰自己，點開微博後台。\n\n\n\n  .......\n\n\n\n  「@追夢的小齊，您的微博【網戀嗎，小姐姐......】已被話題主持人推薦為話題置頂。」\n\n\n\n  @槓精1103號，等15人點讚了您的微博。\n\n\n\n  @樹上兩隻猴，等8人評論了您的微博\n\n\n\n  @火火火大火鍋，等39人關注了您\n\n\n\n  @星星的眼，等168人點讚了您的微博\n\n\n\n  @煙火星痕，等34人轉發了您的微博\n\n\n\n  .......\n\n\n\n  「臥槽？」\n\n\n\n  「發生了啥？」\n\n\n\n  郭齊有點暈。\n\n\n\n  揉了揉眼睛，確認自己沒有看錯。 \n\n\n\n  昨晚睡覺前他還特意確認來著，當時粉絲已經降到了15000多。\n\n\n\n  怎麼一夜之間暴漲2000，現在已經17156了，並且數據還在不斷爬升。\n\n\n\n  「好像火起來了？」\n\n\n\n  看著後台不斷上漲的關注數，郭齊很懵逼。\n\nThe incident began with a sensational news report:\n\n\n\n《Makeup or Disguise? Young Man Sues Bride for Fraud the Day After the Wedding》\n\n\n\nThis was originally just a typical \"car-crash\" news story. It might have been the first time someone sued over this to court, or maybe netizens were just bored.\n\n\n\nIn short, this news went viral.\n\n\n\nMedia outlets rushed to report on it, and the topic quickly conquered Weibo's trending search list and Tomato's hot zone.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until the leaders received regulatory notices and used algorithms to reduce the topic's heat that the netizens' enthusiasm was suppressed.\n\n\nAlthough the news heat subsided, netizens' enthusiasm remained high.\n\n\nDriven by video communities such as Tomato Video and Coffee Show, the heat of related derivative topics quickly surged, attracting many participants.\n\n\n\nTomato Video's hottest topics today include two related ones: \"Watch My 72 Transformations\" and \"Large-Scale Online Dating Meets Offline Reality Scene.\"\n\n\nThe former encourages various beauty gurus to post their makeup videos, while the latter encourages everyone to share their online dating experiences, including many \"car-crash\" experiences.\n\n\nThe number one performance ranking on Coffee Show today is \"What Do I Actually Look Like?\"\n\n\nThis mainly consists of netizens' compilations of celebrities' fluctuating appearances in different situations, with some internet celebrities jumping on the bandwagon.\n\n\nAs the top social media platform, Xinchao Weibo naturally couldn't fall behind. Zhou Bai mobilized his colleagues to promote the topic \"You Know Nothing About Online Dating\" on the homepage's recommended topics.\n\n\nJudging from netizen participation, this topic was quite successful. The angle was very accurate, not limited to the beauty or entertainment field.\n\n\n\nEveryone followed the topic, showcasing their wit and contributing many popular jokes.\n\n\n@IsItAMuleOrAHorseLetsFindOut: [Online Dating Taboos] First, never date someone who doesn't show their real face; second, if you do date them, never meet in person.\n\n\n@LittleRiceBall: Choose me for online dating. No exes online; even if I have any, I won't admit it. I can cheat on you, but if you cheat on me, you're dead to me. 365 fake photos, I have every look you like.\n\n\n@BigBigLeoKoo: Don't easily get into online dating. You never know who's on the other side of the screen... It could be...your dad!\n\n\n@DreamChasingYoungCharmander: The Things Online Dating Taught Me Over the Years [Long Image Text]\n\n\n@IAmCuteChunAh: I was really deceived by my online dating partner, and at that time...\n\n\n......\n\n\nThe topic's reads quickly exceeded tens of millions, with thousands of people discussing it.\n\n\nHowever, there were very few video contents.\n\n\n\"Sigh, Xinchao Weibo's video genes are still too weak,\"\n\n\nZhou Bai sighed, continuing to browse the backend data.\n\n\nThe bosses have chosen to focus on the life and entertainment channels first, so Zhou Bai decided to further guide video creation using this topic.\n\n\nSearching for the keyword \"online dating,\" a greasy title caught Zhou Bai's interest.\n\n\n\n【Little Sister, Wanna Online Date? I'm Super Sweet】\n\n\n\nThe blogger had over 10,000 fans, indicating some content creation experience. The video was only two minutes long, so it wouldn't take much time.\n\n\nZhou Bai opened the video.\n\n\nThe opening scene showed a girl waiting for her online boyfriend. Due to budget constraints, the girl was played by a burly man.\n\n\nFurther down,\n\n\neven the bicycle was played by a person.\n\n\nThat's too perfunctory towards the audience,\n\n\nZhou Bai couldn't help but complain.\n\n\nBut considering the theme, this silly and perfunctory style was surprisingly fitting.\n\n\nContinuing to watch,\n\n\nwhen Little B in the video said, \"Whoa, who the hell is this?\"\n\n\nZhou Bai couldn't help but laugh out loud.\n\n\nThe ending was also very clever, adding humor through a twist while satirizing the materialistic phenomenon in online dating.\n\n\nAfter glancing at the blogger's data, Zhou Bai was puzzled: The video quality was good, so why were the data so bleak?\n\n\nEspecially the number of fans, which was rapidly declining.\n\n\nYesterday, over 1300 fans were lost, and tonight, although there were 10+ new fans after the video was just posted, the total number dropped by another 100.\n\n\nWhat was the reason?\n\n\nFailure to find the reason might dampen the blogger's video creation enthusiasm!\n\n\nThinking of this, Zhou Bai became serious.\n\n\nAfter spending nearly an hour comparing the homepage content and fan tags of accounts at the same level, he finally had the answer.\n\n\nFrom the fan group tags, the blogger lost entertainment-oriented fans, that is, fans who focus on the blogger's appearance and talent.\n\n\nThe new fans over the past two days, however, had tags related to humorous daily life content, and they focused more on the plot of the video.\n\n\nProbably due to a lack of video creation experience, the blogger named \"Chasing Dreams Xiao Qi,\" made many common mistakes when uploading the new video. There was no video description, and no topic tags were selected.\n\n\nThis led to the existing fans not accepting the bare-faced effect, and fans who liked this type of plot content were not recommended by the system.\n\n\nThis resulted in a loss of fans.\n\n\nThe blogger's user reviews confirmed this judgment, and Zhou Bai breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\nA large number of fans were lost due to the video creation, so the blogger must be very anxious and quickly added the second episode of the content.\n\n\nBut the direction was wrong, so no matter how hard they tried, it would be useless.\n\n\nIf he hadn't encountered this, this video would still not have achieved a good effect.\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances, channel editors cannot arbitrarily use their authority to influence account traffic. However, as the host of trending topics, Zhou Bai has the right to edit the page and set top content, only requiring backend reporting.\n\n\nCurrently, there is not much high-quality video content under the topic \"You Know Nothing About Online Dating,\" and this video fits the theme perfectly, so...\n\n\nWithout any hesitation,\n\n\nZhou Bai set Guo Qi's video as the top post and thoughtfully added several topic promotion tags to the video.\n\n\nAfter a while,\n\n\n\"Whoosh\"\n\n\nTraffic from the topic poured in.\n\n\nDue to audience fit, the video's comments and forwards increased rapidly, and a considerable proportion of them were converted into Guo Qi's fans.\n\n\nZhou Bai took out his thermos and brewed a cup of coffee. Imagining the blogger's reaction when they saw the backend data, he felt a sense of accomplishment.\n\n\nGiving roses, leaving fragrance on one’s hands.\n\n\n......\n\n\nThe next day.\n\n\nGuo Qi woke up leisurely in bed and checked the time—it was almost ten o'clock.\n\n\nStill sleepy, Guo Qi decided to take a short nap to refresh himself. Yesterday's video production kept him busy all day, which was very draining.\n\n\nTonight's performance at Bruce's Bar, he would be launching a new song. He needs to rehearse carefully and strive for the best fan-repelling effect.\n\n\nAs for the subsequent impact of repelling fans, Guo Qi didn't care much.\n\n\nAccording to the current fan loss trend, after the system settles the accounts, Guo Qi will have at least hundreds of thousands of cash. Even if the bar doesn't break the contract, Guo Qi doesn't plan to sing there anymore.\n\n\nHe would then find a scenic place, relax on a comfortable vacation, and then use his time-travel advantage to invest his money and become a happy wealthy man.\n\n\nThinking of this, Guo Qi happily unlocked his phone screen.\n\n\nThe full screen of Weibo message prompts made his heart sink, and certain bad premonitions arose in his mind.\n\n\nStay calm,\n\n\ndon't panic,\n\n\nmaybe the video effect was too good, and the fan unsubscribe prompts were too many.\n\n\nGuo Qi comforted himself and opened the Weibo backend.\n\n\n.......\n\n\n\"@Chasing Dreams Xiao Qi, your Weibo post 【Wanna Online Date, Little Sister...】 has been recommended as a top post by the topic host.\"\n\n\n@Nitpicker1103, 15 people liked your Weibo post.\n\n\n@TwoMonkeysInTheTree, 8 people commented on your Weibo post.\n\n\n@FireFireFireHotPot, 39 people followed you.\n\n\n@StarryEyes, 168 people liked your Weibo post.\n\n\n@SmokeAndStarMarks, 34 people reposted your Weibo post.\n\n\n.......\n\n\n\"Whoa?\"\n\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\nGuo Qi was a little dazed.\n\n\nHe rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn't mistaken.\n\n\nBefore going to bed last night, he had specifically checked, and at that time, the fans had dropped to just over 15,000.\n\n\nHow did it surge by 2000 overnight? It's now 17,156, and the data is still climbing.\n\n\n\"It seems to have become popular?\"\n\n\nLooking at the steadily increasing number of followers in the backend, Guo Qi was baffled."

    "content": "事情完全超出了郭齊的預料。\n\n\n\n  他快速翻了一遍微博消息，總算找到了根源所在。\n\n\n\n  都怪最近沉迷拍攝視頻，沒怎麼關注微博熱搜榜。\n\n\n\n  給了他拍視頻靈感的狗血新聞《化妝術還是易容術，小伙婚後第二天狀告新娘詐騙》竟然這麼火，甚至催生了這兩天的熱點話題。\n\n\n\n  而自己運氣也是夠可以，就因為「網戀照騙」這個主題，竟然被超級話題主持人設置成了置頂。\n\n\n\n  怪不得一晚上過去，微博瀏覽量就已經突破20萬。\n\n\n\n  而且和前兩天不同，由於瀏覽人群不再是只關注顏值的顏粉，而是關注視頻內容的大眾網友。\n\n\n\n  因此對視頻的評價也是快速走高。\n\n\n\n  評論區不再是顏粉們的哀嚎，取而代之的是大家的鼓勵支持。\n\n\n\n  @小豆子：博主太有才了，哈哈哈\n\n\n\n  @我這樣的姑娘：小哥哥繼續拍，求續集\n\n\n\n  @城市燈火：拍的很好玩，轉發支持下\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  甚至原本有顏粉看了素顏視頻後，本來要取關，結果因為視頻走紅，倒戈叛變，從顏粉變成了視頻粉。\n\n\n\n  評論區反響熱烈，很多人開始在下面催更，要求續集。 \n\n\n\n  郭齊不禁陷入沉思。\n\n\n\n  難道我要引領這個世界微博拍網劇的潮流？\n\n\n\n  或許，\n\n\n\n  我轉化下思路，不再掉粉追求漲粉？\n\n\n\n  「不不不，怎麼能這麼想呢？」\n\n\n\n  這個可怕的念頭一出現，郭齊就趕緊搖了搖頭，將它扼殺在搖籃之中。\n\n\n\n  這次走紅只是偶然現象，恰好主題撞對了而已。如果不是主題契合，如果沒有超話置頂，肯定不會有這麼好的反響。\n\n\n\n  所謂：有心栽花花不開，無心插柳柳成蔭。\n\n\n\n  且不說拍網劇花費巨大，即便是拍系列短視頻，自己還能準確切中網友們的興趣點嗎？\n\n\n\n  實話說，撲街的概率要遠大於走紅的概率。\n\n\n\n  就算真的又紅了，\n\n\n\n  按照系統轉化規則，盈餘轉化比只有0.1，漲粉10萬僅僅可以獲得1萬塊。而虧損轉化比高達100，10萬塊僅僅掉粉1000就可以了。\n\n\n\n  顯然，掉粉方針依然是最正確的路線。\n\n\n\n  不就是一個話題置頂麼，根據經驗，微博話題的熱度兩天也就消退了，估計再漲個兩三千粉絲也就到頭了，翻不起什麼大風浪。\n\n\n\n  想到這，郭齊鎮定了些許。 \n\n\n\n  心中已有應對之策。\n\n\n\n  新粉絲大都是奔著視頻後續來的，只要拖著不更新續集，很多人自己就會取關了。\n\n\n\n  這兩天微博熱度正高，任何風吹草動都可能引來新的粉絲互動。\n\n\n\n  為避免橫生事端，郭齊決定微博先按兵不動。等風頭過了，再好好收拾這些可愛的小粉絲。\n\n\n\n  CAPO平台不是有8000多粉絲麼？\n\n\n\n  先轉移陣地，借著發布新曲目，敗光在 CAPO上的粉絲緣。\n\n\n\n  只需要一首歌，就可以告訴世界：我郭齊，不僅沒有才華，而且音樂品味相當惡俗，根本唱不來你們愛聽的曲兒。\n\n\n\n  讓他如此自信的一首歌，不是別的，正是前天靈機一動想到的《我的滑板鞋》。\n\n\n\n  作為風靡全國的一首神曲，郭齊前世曾被它荼毒良久，因而印象極深。\n\n\n\n  它收錄於約瑟翰·龐麥郎2012年發行的專輯《舊金屬》，兩年後徹底爆紅。在首屆獨立音樂盤點上被評為「2014年度Top20金曲」。\n\n\n\n  你可能不知道這首歌的名字，但你看到這句「摩擦，摩擦」後，腦海中一定會想起一句聲嘶力竭的「在這光滑的地上摩擦」。\n\n\n\n  選擇這首歌，郭齊仔細考量過。\n\n \n\n  不同於圍繞觀眾音樂偏好而精心設計的神曲《小蘋果》，《我的滑板鞋》在前世之所以走紅，是源於一場全民獵奇。\n\n\n\n  雖然歌曲被約瑟翰·龐麥郎定義為「民謠、朋克、電子、舞曲」，實際旋律非常簡單，RAP也不規範，很多詞沒有對好節奏，就連普通話發音也非常彆扭。\n\n\n\n  因此初期創作之後，無人問津。\n\n\n\n  這也本該是這首歌最初的歸宿。\n\n\n\n  極度平庸的長相以及毫無音樂性的作品，和歌手自我標榜的高端人設產生了極大的反差萌，這引發了某些獵奇人員的關注。\n\n\n\n  2014年，B站鬼畜區翻唱大佬製作了剪輯版MV視頻，獨特的歌詞和唱腔逐漸引發了更多UP主的參與，並逐漸成了全民神曲。\n\n\n\n  也就是說，《滑板鞋》的爆紅不僅偶然，而且和當時的音樂環境有很大的聯繫。即便它曾是一首神曲，脫離了當初的土壤，它並無爆紅的可能。\n\n\n\n  大多數人聽到這首歌的第一反應，應該就是：「這也叫音樂？」\n\n\n\n  翻看曾經的音樂評論，依然有很多人對它的爆紅無法理解。\n\n\n\n  這個世界沒有B站，只有一個與之類似的番茄網。\n\n\n\n  只需小心番茄網，及時掐滅任何苗頭。郭齊敢肯定，這首歌絕對紅不了。 \n\n\n\n  越是有一定的音樂欣賞能力，初期就越是難以接受這種野路子音樂風格。\n\n\n\n  顯然，CAPO上的粉絲不會是它的受眾。\n\n\n\n  想像一個偏愛流行曲風的白領青年，某刻突然聽到一首拍子都踏不準的口水歌，第一時間想到的應該是：「這作者發神經了嗎？」\n\n\n\n  郭齊本想儘快錄製，發表在CAPO平台。\n\n\n\n  但為了穩妥，他還是決定先在布魯斯酒館試唱，看看觀眾們的反應。\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  晚上八點，布魯斯酒館。\n\n\n\n  再次登陸微博後台，郭齊絕望的心情終於得到些許緩解。\n\n\n\n  放緩了，\n\n\n\n  終於放緩了！\n\n\n\n  想不到區區一個話題置頂，效果竟然這麼上頭！\n\n\n\n  從早上到現在，瀏覽量再次猛增50萬，總量已經突破70萬。累計帶來粉絲5000多，比預想中增加了一倍。\n\n\n\n  現在郭齊微博粉絲已經突破2萬。\n\n\n\n  還好目前為止，粉絲上漲勢頭已經緩了下來，從七點到八點，也就增加了不到100。\n\n\n\n  可以稍微放寬心了。\n\n\n\n  「檢查完畢，準備上場了，小齊。」老楊安排人調試好設備，過來招呼道。 \n\n\n\n  「OK。」\n\n\n\n  郭齊比了個手勢，從漲粉的巨大悲痛中走出，背著吉他走上舞台。\n\n\n\n  循規蹈矩的表演流程，有時是翻唱，有時是原創，引發了台下觀眾的陣陣歡呼。\n\n\n\n  快到尾聲時，郭齊猛的掃了把弦，面容鄭重的對著話筒說道：「對不起。」\n\n\n\n  刷刷刷，\n\n\n\n  聽到這句莫名的道歉，台下好幾雙眼睛都看了過來。\n\n\n\n  「對不起，」郭齊頓了頓，繼續道：「大家可能比較奇怪，我為什麼突然道歉。」\n\n\n\n  「因為我騙了大家。」\n\n\n\n  「一直以來我做的其實都是市場喜歡的音樂，而不是我自己喜歡的音樂。因為我擔心，市場會不接受我的風格。」\n\n\n\n  這段自白，是郭齊的精心編排，這樣可以解釋音樂風格為什麼會變化這麼大，也變相的和《夏日稻香》等受歡迎的歌曲撇開關係。\n\n\n\n  他控制著語氣，繼續真誠的說道：「下面這首歌，才是真正的我。感謝大家的支持和包容，對於這首歌，我只想說，如果愛請深愛，如果不愛請果斷離開。」\n\n\n\n  .......\n\n\n\n  聽完這段自白，台下突然安靜了。\n\n\n\n  嚯，歌手要放什麼大招了嗎？ \n\n\n\n  在一片期待中，不知誰起了個頭，大家開始紛紛鼓掌。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦啦」\n\n\n\n  「啪啪啪」\n\n\n\n  在一片掌聲中，郭齊扶著話筒，輕聲開嗓。\n\n\n\n  「《我的滑板鞋》，獻給大家。」\n\nThe events completely exceeded Guo Qi's expectations.\n\n\n\nHe quickly scrolled through his Weibo messages and finally found the source.\n\n\n\nIt was all because he had been so engrossed in making videos recently that he hadn't paid much attention to the Weibo trending topics.\n\n\n\nThe sensational news that had inspired his video,  \"Makeup or Disguise? Young Man Sues Bride for Fraud the Day After the Wedding,\" had become incredibly popular, even spawning hot topics for the past two days.\n\n\n\nAnd his luck was truly remarkable; because of the theme \"Online Dating Photo Fraud,\" his video had been set as the top post by the super topic host.\n\n\n\nNo wonder the Weibo views had already surpassed 200,000 overnight.\n\n\n\nMoreover, unlike the previous two days, the viewers were no longer just fans focused on his looks but general netizens interested in the video content.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the reviews of the video quickly improved.\n\n\n\nThe comments section was no longer filled with the wails of his appearance-focused fans; instead, it was filled with encouragement and support.\n\n\n\n@Xiaodouzi: The blogger is so talented, hahaha\n\n\n\n@I'mThisKindOfGirl: Little brother, keep filming!  We want a sequel!\n\n\n\n@CityLights:  It's very funny. Retweeting to show my support!\n\n\n\n......\n\n\n\nEven some fans who had initially intended to unfollow him after seeing his bare-faced video, ended up changing their minds because of the video's popularity, transforming from appearance fans into video fans.\n\n\n\nThe comments section was buzzing with enthusiastic responses, with many people urging for updates and sequels.\n\n\n\nGuo Qi fell into thought.\n\n\n\nShould I lead the world's trend of filming web dramas on Weibo?\n\n\n\nPerhaps,\n\n\n\nI could change my approach, no longer aiming to lose fans but to gain them?\n\n\n\n\"No, no, no, how could I think like that?\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as this terrifying thought appeared, Guo Qi quickly shook his head, stifling it in its cradle.\n\n\n\nThis sudden surge in popularity was purely accidental; it just so happened that the theme was a perfect match.  Without the theme's relevance, without the super topic top placement, there definitely wouldn't have been such a positive response.\n\n\n\nAs the saying goes:  You diligently plant flowers, yet they don't bloom; you casually plant willows, and they flourish.\n\n\n\nNot to mention the huge expense of filming a web drama, even if he were to film a series of short videos, could he accurately hit the netizens' interest points?\n\n\n\nHonestly speaking, the probability of failure was far greater than the probability of success.\n\n\n\nEven if he did become popular again,\n\n\n\naccording to the system's conversion rules, the profit conversion rate is only 0.1; gaining 100,000 fans would only earn him 10,000 yuan. While the loss conversion rate is as high as 100; losing 100,000 yuan would only result in losing 1,000 fans.\n\n\n\nClearly, the strategy of losing fans is still the most correct path.\n\n\n\nIt's just a top-placed topic, right? Based on experience, the popularity of Weibo topics fades after two days; he estimated that gaining another two or three thousand fans would be the limit, not making any major waves.\n\n\n\nThinking this, Guo Qi calmed down somewhat.\n\n\n\nHe already had a countermeasure in mind.\n\n\n\nMost of the new fans are here for the video sequel.  As long as he delays updating the sequel, many people will unfollow him on their own.\n\n\n\nWeibo’s popularity is high these two days; any slight movement could attract new fan interactions.\n\n\n\nTo avoid any unforeseen problems, Guo Qi decided to remain inactive on Weibo for now. He would deal with these adorable little fans after the hype has died down.\n\n\n\nDoesn't the CAPO platform have over 8,000 fans?\n\n\n\nHe would shift his focus, releasing a new song to squander his fan base on CAPO.\n\n\n\nOne song would be enough to tell the world: I, Guo Qi, not only lack talent, but my musical taste is extremely vulgar; I simply can't sing the songs you love to hear.\n\n\n\nThe song that gave him such confidence was none other than \"My Skate Shoes,\" which he had spontaneously thought of the day before yesterday.\n\n\n\nAs a song that swept the nation, Guo Qi had been tormented by it in his past life and therefore had a deep impression of it.\n\n\n\nIt was included in the album \"Old Metal\" released by Yosehan Pongmalang in 2012, and became a massive hit two years later.  It was rated \"Top 20 Song of 2014\" in the first independent music review.\n\n\n\nYou may not know the name of this song, but after seeing the line \"Friction, friction,\" a raspy \"Friction on this smooth ground\" will certainly come to mind.\n\n\n\nGuo Qi carefully considered his choice of this song.\n\n\n\nUnlike the hit song \"Little Apple,\" which was carefully designed around the audience's musical preferences, the reason \"My Skate Shoes\" became popular in his past life was due to a nationwide phenomenon of curiosity.\n\n\n\nAlthough the song was defined by Yosehan Pongmalang as \"folk, punk, electronic, and dance,\" the actual melody was very simple, the rap was irregular, many lyrics didn't match the rhythm, and even the Mandarin pronunciation was very awkward.\n\n\n\nTherefore, after its initial creation, it went unnoticed.\n\n\n\nThis should have been the song's original fate.\n\n\n\nThe extremely ordinary appearance and completely unmusical work created a huge contrast with the singer's self-proclaimed high-end persona, which attracted the attention of certain curious individuals.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, a cover superstar from Bilibili's ghost-畜 area created an edited MV video.  The unique lyrics and singing gradually attracted more UP masters to participate, and it gradually became a national hit song.\n\n\n\nIn other words, the popularity of \"Skate Shoes\" was not only accidental but also closely related to the musical environment at that time. Even though it was once a hit song, separated from its original context, it had no chance of becoming popular again.\n\n\n\nMost people's first reaction to hearing this song would be: \"Is this even called music?\"\n\n\n\nLooking back at past music reviews, many people still couldn't understand its popularity.\n\n\n\nIn this world, there is no Bilibili, only a similar website called Tomato Network.\n\n\n\nJust be careful with Tomato Network and nip any signs of its popularity in the bud. Guo Qi was certain that this song would definitely not become popular.\n\n\n\nThe more musical appreciation one has, the more difficult it is to accept this unconventional musical style initially.\n\n\n\nClearly, the fans on CAPO would not be its target audience.\n\n\n\nImagine a white-collar youth who prefers popular music styles; the moment they suddenly hear a song with an off-beat rhythm, their first thought would probably be: \"Is this author crazy?\"\n\n\n\nGuo Qi originally planned to record it quickly and release it on the CAPO platform.\n\n\n\nBut to be safe, he decided to test it out at the Blues Bar first to see the audience's reaction.\n\n\n\n......\n\n\n\nEight o'clock in the evening, the Blues Bar.\n\n\n\nAfter logging back into the Weibo backend, Guo Qi's despair finally eased somewhat.\n\n\n\nIt's slowing down,\n\n\n\nfinally slowing down!\n\n\n\nWho would have thought that a mere top-placed topic would have such a significant impact!\n\n\n\nFrom morning until now, the views have increased by another 500,000, exceeding 700,000 in total.  It brought in over 5,000 fans, double what he had expected.\n\n\n\nGuo Qi's Weibo followers have now surpassed 20,000.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the rate of fan growth has slowed down; from seven to eight o'clock, it only increased by less than 100.\n\n\n\nHe could finally relax a little.\n\n\n\n\"Check complete.  Get ready to go on stage, Xiao Qi.\" Lao Yang, having arranged for someone to adjust the equipment, came over to call him.\n\n\n\n\"OK.\"\n\n\n\nGuo Qi gave a gesture, stepping out of the immense grief of gaining fans, and walked onto the stage with his guitar on his back.\n\n\n\nThe performance followed a regular procedure, sometimes covers, sometimes original songs, eliciting cheers from the audience.\n\n\n\nNear the end, Guo Qi strummed his guitar forcefully, his face serious as he spoke into the microphone:  \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\n\nSwish swish swish,\n\n\n\nHearing this inexplicable apology, several pairs of eyes in the audience turned towards him.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Guo Qi paused, continuing, \"You might find it strange why I'm suddenly apologizing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Because I've deceived you all.\"\n\n\n\n\"All along, I've been making music that the market likes, not the music I like. Because I was worried that the market wouldn't accept my style.\"\n\n\n\nThis confession was carefully planned by Guo Qi. It could explain why his musical style had changed so drastically, and it also indirectly distanced himself from popular songs like \"Summer Rice Fragrance.\"\n\n\n\nControlling his tone, he continued sincerely, \"The next song is the real me. Thank you for your support and understanding. Regarding this song, I just want to say, if you love it, love it deeply; if you don't love it, please leave decisively.\"\n\n\n\n.......\n\n\n\nAfter hearing this confession, the audience suddenly fell silent.\n\n\n\nWhoa, is the singer about to unleash some big move?\n\n\n\nAmidst the anticipation, someone started clapping, and soon everyone followed suit.\n\n\n\n\"Clap clap clap\"\n\n\n\n\"Clap clap clap\"\n\n\n\nAmidst the applause, Guo Qi held the microphone and softly began to sing.\n\n\n\n\"My Skate Shoes,\" he said, \"for everyone.\""

Mostly low-alcohol drinks favored by girls, such as mojitos and passion fruit drinks.\n\n\n  Watching Guo Qi on stage, she took a small sip and gently shook her head.\n\n\n  Still not quite there.\n\n\n  Although he's handsome and can sing and compose, he lacks his own unique style. His handsomeness is ordinary, and his singing is mediocre.\n\n\n  Perhaps for a small company, Guo Qi has met the entry-level standard. But they are not a small company; they are Ku Gua Entertainment, the current leader in the entertainment agency industry!\n\n\n  Nearly half of the idol groups that have debuted and become popular in recent years were created by Ku Gua.\n\n\n  Ku Gua products are guaranteed to be high-quality.\n\n\n  This is already common knowledge within the industry.\n\n\n  Every year, countless young male idols fight to enter Ku Gua Entertainment to become trainees, so the selection criteria are extremely strict.\n\n\n  To improve the quality of selection, Ku Gua insists on being selective rather than filling quotas, setting a monthly upper limit on the number of candidates that scouts can report. This month, Gu Tang already has few reporting quotas left.\n\n\n  That's right, Gu Tang is a professional scout.\n\n\n  This is the common term; internally at Ku Gua, her position TITLE is Assistant of the Film and Television Department, helping the company discover more potential newcomers to the entertainment industry.\n\n\n  After seeing Guo Qi last Friday, Gu Tang had already mentally PASSED him. But under Jia Yun Duo's strong recommendation, she inexplicably came again.\n\n\n  What if she misjudged him last Friday?\n\n\n  But after watching his performance, she mentally PASSED Guo Qi again.\n\n\n  As she was about to leave, Guo Qi's self-introduction on stage stopped her.\n\n\n  \"《My Skate Shoes》, the song title is quite novel, will it be a good song?\"\n\n\n  The accompaniment started, a relatively rhythmic one.\n\n\n  Gu Tang nodded slightly.\n\n\n  As a young person, especially an entertainment industry worker, she has been exposed to many overseas RAP and hip-hop styles, but there are not many works of this style in China.\n\n\n  The mainstream in the current Chinese music scene is still Ballad and R&B styles; listening to them too much gets a little tiresome.\n\n\n  Continuing to listen,\n\n\n  Gu Tang focused.\n\n\n  The style is quite new, but the melody is a bit simple, and the lyrics are quite interesting.\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n  Some things I have forgotten\n\n\n  But I still remember now\n\n\n  One evening my mother asked me\n\n\n  Why are you unhappy today\n\n\n  I said in my imagination there's a pair of skate shoes\n\n\n  Unique, most fashionable, dancing must be great\n\n\n  Searched the whole city, all the streets, none\n\n\n \n\n  She said you'll find them someday\n\n\n  Time, time will give me the answer\n\n\n  On Sunday I searched again, still nothing found\n\n\n  A month later I went to a second city\n\n\n  The people here call it the City of Charm\n\n\n  Time flies, night is falling\n\n\n  I think I have to leave\n\n\n  As I was about to leave, I saw a specialty store\n\n\n  That's the skate shoes I want\n\n\n  My skate shoes, fashionable, fashionable, the most fashionable\n\n\n  On the way home, I couldn't help myself\n\n\n  Friction, friction\n\n\n  Friction on this smooth ground\n\n\n  .....\n\n\n  This is a narrative song in the RAP and hip-hop style.\n\n\n  In today's popular Ballad music scene, R&B style is already a new element, while RAP style is even rarer and doesn't have good audience acceptance.\n\n\n  Due to her profession, Gu Tang is frequently exposed to new styles and can appreciate the unique aspects of the song.\n\n\n  But the audience downstage frowned repeatedly as they listened.\n\n\n  They don't know what RAP is, what Hip-Hop is.  Their first exposure to this rap style feels very unusual.\n\n\n  It's not unpleasant, but.....\n\n\n  The melody is too weak, not catchy.\n\n\n  The lyrics also lack beauty, like a primary school student's composition.\n\n\n  It sounds more like Shandong fast-talking folk art.\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n  The song ended, and the audience was silent.\n\n\n  After a moment, some fans began to clap sparsely, then the applause gradually became enthusiastic.\n\n\n  This should be friendly encouragement.\n\n\n  Good.\n\n\n  That's exactly the effect he wanted.\n\n\n  Guo Qi felt very encouraged; judging from the live performance at the Blues Bar, \"My Skate Shoes\" had been a successful debut.\n\n\n  It's obvious that ordinary audiences can't accept this hip-hop style of music. And within the rap circle, \"My Skate Shoes\" seems very inauthentic.\n\n\n  There's no fast, explosive FLOW (rap segment), nor a catchy HOOK (chorus); true hip-hop fans won't buy it.\n\n\n  Ordinary audiences and rap fans don't like it, pleasing neither side.\n\n\n  This is exactly what Guo Qi hoped for.\n\n\n  Smiling, he bowed and left the stage.\n\n\n  Guo Qi decided in his heart that he would record \"My Skate Shoes\" back in the dorm and post it on CAPO.\n\n\n  His Weibo followers have already exceeded 20,000, an increase of 3,000 compared to before. When the system settles the account, Guo Qi can get 3,000 yuan.\n\n\n  At first glance, it seems like he earned money.\n\n\n  But if it were a loss of fans, 3,000 fans are worth 300,000 yuan!\n\n\n  He had already successfully lost 1,200 fans, earning 120,000 yuan, but a wave of top-posting operations brought them back. In Guo Qi's view, this wasn't earning 3,000 yuan, it was losing 120,000 yuan!\n\n\n  There are still 4 days until the settlement; Guo Qi plans to act quickly and reduce his CAPO fans as much as possible.  He strives to make up for the \"loss\" caused by the increase in Weibo followers.\n\n\n  After Guo Qi left the stage, he was planning near the bar when he suddenly felt someone patting his shoulder.\n\n\n  Turning around, he saw a girl with exquisite makeup and a very capable look, a few years older than him.\n\n\n  The woman tucked her short hair behind her ears and introduced herself: \"Hello, Guo Qi, right? My name is Gu Tang, I'm a scout, a friend introduced me.\"\n\n\n  \"Hello, hello.\" Guo Qi returned the greeting.\n\n\n  If it were the old Guo Qi, he would have been overjoyed and fawned over Gu Tang. Now he is different; he has no interest in fame, he just wants to lose fans quickly and use the system's money for investment.\n\n\n  As for being discovered by a scout and becoming a trainee, the probability of debuting is low, and even if he debuted, he might not necessarily make money, and he wouldn't be very free.\n\n\n  To Gu Tang's arrival, Guo Qi not only showed no surprise, but was quite wary, making sure she didn't ruin his plan to lose fans.\n\n\n  Guo Qi's reaction was so calm, it was somewhat unexpected to Gu Tang.\n\n\n  For a moment, they were speechless.\n\n\n  Gu Tang broke the awkward silence: \"If you're not busy, would you mind joining me for a drink?\"\n\n\n  \"Of course not, I'll treat you.\"\n\n\n  Guo Qi was still very happy to drink with a beautiful woman. They went to a table, sat down, and ordered two drinks.\n\n\n  \"My Skate Shoes\" allowed Gu Tang to see Guo Qi's potential, but she also didn't rule out the possibility that this song was a flash in the pan, so Gu Tang didn't intend to sign Guo Qi now.\n\n\n  She could maintain contact; if he has other works with such a personal style in the future, she could sign him then and follow the singer development route.\n\n\n  Before that, she needed to encourage Guo Qi to avoid him losing confidence in his innovative style.\n\n\n  This was also Gu Tang's purpose for actively seeking out Guo Qi.\n\n\n  Learning that Gu Tang wasn't going to sign him, Guo Qi also breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\n  One less risk of becoming famous.\n\n\n  They chatted about the creative background and ideas of \"My Skate Shoes,\" and also exchanged opinions on musical styles.\n\n\n  Guo Qi worried about being late and the dorm closing, so he left first.\n\n\n  Watching Guo Qi leave, Gu Tang found herself moved by their conversation, and she had an urge: to help this young man who doesn't seek fame, but only dreams of music.\n\n\n  Taking out her phone, she found a contact saved as \"Peach,\" and sent a voice message.\n\n\n  \"Sister, are you still awake? You're doing online radio shows recently, I found a very suitable song, I'll send it to you...\"\n\n\n  Peach replied quickly: \"Thank you, dear, you're so thoughtful. What song, send it quickly and let me see.  I haven't decided on the radio theme recently, it's worrying me to death.\""

    "content": "For graduating seniors, it doesn't matter whether there are classes or not.\n\n\n  As long as you are bold enough, you can have a holiday anytime.\n\n\n  There are no cowards in dorm 601.\n\n\n  Liu Yu and Wang Cheng played games until late last night and are still sleeping soundly now. Sun Xingzhou is collecting information about job fairs online and preparing for job hunting.\n\n\n  Guo Qi, who is anxious to release a new song, is the earliest one to get up in the dorm.\n\n\n  There is a music store at the school gate. Due to poor business, the practice rooms prepared by the owner are usually unused. Guo Qi often rents them for a few hours at a low price as a recording studio.\n\n\n  The accompaniment is ready-made.\n\n\n  Because it's used to lose fans, the quality of the song doesn't matter. Guo Qi doesn't care about minor problems such as occasional lyric errors, missed beats, and rhythm problems.\n\n\n  Just consider it a tribute to the original singer.\n\n\n  With this attitude, the song recording speed is very fast, and it's all done in less than an hour.\n\n\n  At 11 a.m., Guo Qi released the new song on the CAPO platform.\n\n\n  And he updated the heartfelt confession from last night as the song description.\n\n\n  \"...In the future, I will firmly believe in and make the music that is truly in my heart. If you like it, please continue to support me. If you can't accept it, thank you for your past support for Xiao Qi.\"\n\n\n  It's simply a disguised way of telling fans: I will stick to this style of music in the future. If you don't like it, please unfollow me, goodbye.\n\n\n  Unlike Weibo, CAPO is also a copyright trading platform. After uploading the work, you also need to set the authorization fee.\n\n\n  There are three levels of authorization fees: \"personal,\" \"enterprise,\" and \"unlimited.\"\n\n\n  Personal authorization has the lowest price and is limited to personal use, such as personal downloads, private parties, and independent films, etc. Playing and listening on the platform is completely free.\n\n\n  Enterprise authorization has a moderate price and can be used for commercial purposes, usually with exposure not exceeding 1 million.\n\n\n  Unlimited authorization, as the name suggests, does not restrict the use.\n\n\n  Guo Qi briefly looked at the terms and symbolically set the three fees at 1 yuan, 10 yuan, and 100 yuan.\n\n\n  \"Your pricing is lower than the market average price. Please confirm if your bid is reasonable?\"\n\n\n  Seeing the prompt from the CAPO system, Guo Qi resolutely clicked OK.\n\n\n  Anyway, it won't be a hit, so the pricing doesn't matter.\n\n\n  A few minutes later, a prompt appeared on the CAPO homepage.\n\n\n  \"Your new work 'My Skate Shoes' has been successfully released.\"\n\n\n  .......\n\n\n  Taozi, whose real name is Yang Qingtao, was once the leading actress of Jiangzhou Radio's lifestyle broadcast.\n\n\n  The entertainment commentary program \"Tonight, Let's Talk Freely\" she hosted consistently ranked among the top three in the station's ratings.\n\n\n  Unfortunately, she entered the industry a bit late and didn't catch the good times.\n\n\n  Due to the impact of television and audio-visual media and the new internet media, the traditional broadcasting market is shrinking. Except for some traffic broadcasts, many broadcasting channels have no listeners.\n\n\n  Coupled with the inflexible wage system within the system, even as the leading actress, Taozi's monthly net salary is only six to seven thousand yuan.\n\n\n  The lipsticks and bags she likes are things she can only look at but can't afford.\n\n\n  This profession is really too miserable.\n\n\n  Forced by life,\n\n\n  Passion is no match for money.\n\n\n  While she still has some popularity, Taozi thought it over and finally resigned from the municipal radio station. She joined the online radio station Alps FM and hosted a program called \"Tonight's Heart-to-Heart Talk.\"\n\n\n  The positioning is similar to the \"Tonight, Let's Talk Freely\" she did at the station, mainly commenting on hot events in life.\n\n\n  After two months,\n\n\n  the effect is significant,\n\n\n  freed from the constraints of the system, Taozi's monthly income quickly changed from six to seven thousand yuan to... four to five thousand yuan.\n\n\n  There's no way, it's really too difficult!\n\n\n  As a new form fostered by the internet, online radio has only emerged in the past two years. The two most famous platforms are Alps and Qingguo FM.\n\n\n  In the early stages, in order to attract broadcasters to join, the platform spent a lot of money inviting celebrities to be spokespersons and supported a large number of early internet celebrity broadcasters through star-making activities.\n\n\n  Such as a recent graduate who makes 1 million yuan a month by telling horror stories,\n\n\n  a stay-at-home mom who works part-time at a radio station and earns hundreds of thousands of yuan a month,\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n  Taozi was moved,\n\n\n  after joining,\n\n\n  she found out she had been deceived.\n\n\n  Every month, a large number of people are attracted by the star-making campaign, including many broadcasters who have popularity and experience like her.\n\n\n  Every imaginable radio station positioning, such as relationships, celebrity gossip, funny and silly news in life, there are a lot of people doing it.\n\n\n  The competition is extremely fierce.\n\n\n  In the entertainment commentary field alone, which Taozi focuses on, hundreds of programs are updated every day. Some even use suggestive content to attract attention.\n\n\n  Looking at other people's popularity rankings and then at her own, Taozi almost couldn't help but moan on her show.\n\n\n  Many industries are like this; only a small number of people are glamorous, and most people are just cannon fodder.\n\n\n  Many people may only earn a few dozen yuan after working for half a year.\n\n\n  Taozi, who has a stable income after only two months, is already considered to have established herself and has taken one step towards success.\n\n\n  As for the other foot, when it will be taken...\n\n\n  It can only be said that the future is bright.\n\n\n  Thirty years in the West, thirty years in the East, don't bully Taozi when she's poor.\n\n\n  Taozi clenched her fists, looked at the new Dior perfume on the e-commerce website, and could only look enviously.\n\n\n  Unfortunately, she can't afford it.\n\n\n  Last month's net income was only 5108 yuan, and the rent alone was 2000 yuan. The rest, including food, drink, and daily expenses for the program, basically leaves her with nothing.\n\n\n  \"Ahhhhh, if I don't work harder, I'll be eating dirt. I'll probably only be able to afford instant noodles during holidays.\"\n\n\n  Taozi scratched her head in distress, feeling that she was too miserable.\n\n\n  In order to increase her income and buy lipsticks and bags sooner, Taozi is planning a new program, but she hasn't figured out the positioning yet.\n\n\n  A warm emotional radio program?\n\n\n  Celebrity gossip?\n\n\n  A sensational love story report?\n\n\n  Or, the literary and artistic style of sour words?\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n  These can all be done, but the question is, will they be popular?\n\n\n  Taozi felt that she needed to carefully study this.\n\n\n  It was already eleven o'clock at night. Taozi finished the latest episode of \"Tonight's Heart-to-Heart Talk\" and lay in bed thinking.\n\n\n  \"Buzz\"\n\n\n  The phone rang.\n\n\n  It was a message from someone named Gu Tang.\n\n\n  \"Sister, are you still awake? You've been doing online radio programs recently, and I found a very suitable song. I'll send it to you...\"\n\n\n  Gu Tang, what does this person do?\n\n\n  The impression is a little vague.\n\n\n  Taozi scratched her head and remembered that this person was from Kuaigua Entertainment Company, who had previously collaborated with Jiangzhou Radio to promote their new artists.\n\n\n  After a few months, the effect was not good, and then the cooperation stopped.\n\n\n  During the cooperation, she and Gu Tang were quite familiar and often ate together. It's just that they haven't been in touch for almost a year.\n\n\n  Could it be that Kuaigua has some resources in online radio?\n\n\n  Taozi was very excited and quickly replied.\n\n\n  \"Thank you, darling, you're so thoughtful. What song is it? Send it over quickly. I haven't decided on the theme of the radio program recently, and it's been worrying me.\"\n\n\n  After a while, Gu Tang replied.\n\n\n  \"Wait a minute, Sister Taozi, this song seems to haven't been released yet. I'll keep you updated.\"\n\n\n  \"Okay, I'll wait for you.\"\n\n\n  Taozi replied quickly, along with an emoticon.\n\n\n  It turns out that it is the debut song of an artist under Kuaigua! That needs to be taken seriously!\n\n\n  Maybe this is the beginning of a long-term cooperation between me and Kuaigua.\n\n\n  If I can rely on Kuaigua...\n\n\n  Thinking of this, Taozi's expression became serious.\n\n\n  .....\n\n\n  This wait lasted until the next day.\n\n\n  Until more than twelve o'clock, Taozi, who almost forgot about it, received a WeChat message from Gu Tang.\n\n\n  It was a music link from CAPO, the name was...\n\n\n  \"My Skate Shoes\"."

    "content": "This name…interesting.\n\n\nIt’s so common, yet so elegant.  Ordinary singers wouldn’t dare use it.\n\n\n不愧是酷瓜這種大公司的藝人，連歌曲名字，都帶有如此獨特迷人的氣質。\n\n\nPeach mused.\n\n\nSuddenly, she remembered that Ms. Gu Tang hadn’t mentioned the publicity commission. Could she be…freeloading off me?\n\n\nAfter agonizing over it for a long time, Peach didn’t dare ask.\n\n\nAfter all, the program is still small, and she’ll need Ku Gua’s continued support in the future.  It’s better to maintain this relationship first.\n\n\nIf the collaboration goes well, getting a long-term contract would be a huge win.\n\n\nThinking this, Peach happily clicked on the link.\n\n\nShe glanced at the singer’s homepage…\n\n\nGuo Qi?\n\n\nNever heard of him.\n\n\nHuh?\n\n\nHis data seems pretty bad… well, not very good.\n\n\nMaybe he just debuted recently, and Ku Gua plans to push him hard.\n\n\nAccording to the normal publicity process, if he weren’t an artist selected by the company, he wouldn’t be eligible for any promotional resources.\n\n\nPeach, always a bit scatterbrained, didn’t even consider the possibility of a personal connection with Gu Tang.\n\n\nShe clicked on the song \"Roller Skates,\" and the description seemed to indicate that it was a major transformation work by the singer.\n\n\nWith a hint of anticipation, Peach put on her headphones and started listening.\n\n\n“.........In the future, I will firmly believe in my own heart and make music that’s true to myself. If you like it, please continue to support me. If you don’t like it, thank you for your past support of Xiao Qi.”\n\n\nBefore the song, there was a monologue by the author. Guo Qi originally intended to hint to unsupportive fans to unfollow him, but to Peach at this moment, it sounded like the resolution of an idealist, and she added points to her impression of the author.\n\n\n《我的滑板鞋》\n\n\nLyrics｜Guo Qi\n\n\nMusic｜Guo Qi\n\n\nSome things I've already forgotten\n\n\nBut I still remember now\n\n\nOne night my mother asked me\n\n\nWhy are you unhappy today\n\n\nI said in my imagination there's a pair of roller skates\n\n\nUnique, the most fashionable, dancing must be great\n\n\nSearched the whole city, all the streets, there weren’t any\n\n\nShe said you will find them someday\n\n\n.....\n\n\nAfter listening to it for the first time, full of anticipation, Peach rested her head on her hand, falling into a state of bewilderment.\n\n\nThat's it?\n\n\nThis…what is this?\n\n\nThe melody isn't catchy, and the lyrics are very plain.  Where's the \"I once shattered a whole mirror, and cried for you in the dead of night\"—that kind of catchy lyric.\n\n\nHowever, he is, after all, an artist that Ku Gua is promoting.\n\n\nThe subtleties of the song need to be carefully savored and explored.\n\n\nWith trust in Ku Gua's artists and importance given to this collaboration, Peach decided to listen to it a few more times to deepen her understanding of the song.\n\n\nAfter a few more listens, her thinking really opened up.\n\n\nAfter careful consideration, Peach suddenly realized:  worthy of being Ku Gua's approved main track, she almost missed such a fantastic piece of music!\n\n\nFrom the perspective of lyrical logic, \"Roller Skates\" is a narrative, with a complete overall plot, telling a seemingly ordinary but thought-provoking little story. On the surface, it's about the experience of searching for roller skates, but in reality, it's a true portrayal of a grassroots person chasing their dreams.\n\n\nLooking back at the lyrics \"I once shattered a whole mirror,\" it sounds amazing at first listen, but logically it's ambiguous and doesn't stand up to close scrutiny.\n\n\nMelodically, besides the rap style, \"Roller Skates\" also clearly incorporates international trendy styles such as Britpop and nu-metal. This shows that the creator has a deep background and is familiar with many styles.\n\n\nThe current style is a deliberate choice by the author.\n\n\nAlthough the melody is too simple, the advantages are also quite obvious: the whole song is catchy, and anyone can hum along to the rhythm after just one listen.\n\n\nThe barrier to entry is lower than that of ordinary songs.\n\n\nA low barrier to entry means a larger music audience; this is a song written for the working people!\n\n\nUnderstanding this, Peach instantly understood, and two lines of poetry came to her mind.\n\n\n\"The swallows of the old Wang Xie mansion, now fly into ordinary people's homes.\"\n\n\nPeach, with her imagination running wild, painted this picture of Guo Qi in her mind.\n\n\nAs Ku Gua's favored and promoted artist, there's a whole set of mature promotion processes available.  There will be people researching the market, tailoring songs to appeal to the audience.\n\n\nBut he chose to say no to all of that.\n\n\nInstead, he resolutely chose another path: making music that more people can enjoy. Even if some people say he's lowbrow, that he can't create, he still chooses to bear all of that.\n\n\nTo speak for the vast majority of the people!\n\n\nThinking of this,\n\n\nPeach’s eyes welled up.\n\n\nListening to the song again, she clearly felt that this was a truly grassroots voice of dreams!\n\n\nInspiration surged from her heart, and she suddenly thought of the new radio program's positioning—the best positioning is to follow your own dreams.\n\n\nIs \"Tonight's Heart-to-Heart\" a program she truly wants to do?\n\n\nNo, it's just an imitation of \"Tonight's Free Talk\" to cater to her old fans.  She worked hard, but she didn't put her heart into it.\n\n\nLooking back on her years as a broadcaster, she remembered her childhood.\n\n\nWhen most of her peers were enthusiastic about television programs, Peach often held a radio, listening non-stop.\n\n\nTelevision often showed the lives of big names, too far removed from everyday life. The radio was full of ordinary people's stories; these everyday stories made the little girl sometimes moved, sometimes angry, and she felt more deeply the world.\n\n\nIt was probably from that time that young Peach developed the desire to be a broadcaster.\n\n\nShe wanted to use her voice to tell more people about the stories happening in the corners of the world.\n\n\nWith this in mind, Peach already knew the name of her new program.\n\n\n《在人間》\n\n\nThe world's myriad changes, the five flavors of life.\n\n\nLet's start the first episode with \"Roller Skates\".\n\n\nTell the stories of those who are silently working hard, still struggling with life.\n\n\nTell their aspirations and dreams.\n\n\nPeach got excited.\n\n\nUnlike when she was doing \"Tonight's Heart-to-Heart\", racking her brains for content, as soon as she had thought up the positioning of \"In the Human World\" and the general direction of the first episode, Peach felt countless words pouring towards her.\n\n\nAs if they wanted to be presented to the world through her hands.\n\n\nTaking a deep breath, Peach typed the first sentence of the new program on the keyboard.\n\n\n\"After years of being a radio host, I have come into contact with the stories of too many celebrities. Today, I want to lower my eyes, no longer look up, but look around me, and tell the stories happening around me.\"\n\n\n\"To be born a human being, for some people, is the luckiest thing they have ever had in their lives.\"\n\n\n\"This is Cheng Hao's story.\"\n\n\n\"Since birth, I haven't walked on the ground. Doctors once predicted that I wouldn't live past the age of five. However, just a few minutes ago, I was still using Taobao to choose a birthday gift for my twentieth birthday.\n\n\nWhen my peers were still in kindergarten, I had already been to major city hospitals. When my peers were playing seesaw and skipping rope, I was experiencing million-dollar medical equipment moving around on my body.\n\n\nI have taken medicines that even pigs wouldn't eat, been pricked with needles that carry electric currents, practiced incredible qigong, and even lived in an orphanage full of abandoned children. In those lonely days, I was surrounded by children with intellectual disabilities. When I was most lonely, I could only sing alone in the corridor…\n\n\nIn twenty years, my mother doesn't know how many critical illness notices the doctors gave me. A thick stack of papers, she used a ten-centimeter-long nail to nail them to the wall, saying it was very commemorative.\n\n\nWhen I was young, I suffered from physical pain. When I grew up, I experienced inner torment. Sometimes, I couldn't help but ask: \"Why did God choose me to bear all this?\"\n\n\nBut no one could give me an answer.  I can only say that misfortune, like fortune, needs someone to bear it.\n\n\nDestiny, don't talk about fairness!\n\n\n.....\n\n\nI'm not an inspirational figure like Ms. Zhang, nor a literary giant like Mr. Shi Tie. I'm just an ordinary \"professional patient.\" But I want to say that what's truly awesome isn't those things you can easily brag about, but those ordinary people who still smile in the face of adversity.\n\n\n.....\n\n\nThis is Cheng Hao's story, and I was touched the moment I saw it.\n\n\nThe world was like night to him, but he lit a lamp for himself.\n\n\nI once wanted to find a song for his story, but I couldn't find one for a long time.  Later I realized it's because we're all ordinary people.\n\n\nWe don't have earth-shattering suffering, nor shocking happiness. We're just looking for light, or, looking for a pair of roller skates.\n\n\nThis is a song that needs to be listened to quietly.\n\n\nFrom a young singer, let this song add a footnote to Cheng Hao's story.\n\n\n《我的滑板鞋》\n\n\nThe melody starts\n\n\n......"

Wang Cheng and the others got up early today to attend the campus recruitment fair.\n\n\n\n  With the system, Guo Qi had no intention of finding a job. He just wanted to quietly lose fans.\n\n\n\n  Unfortunately, the song he posted on CAPO hadn't seen any noticeable effect.  It seemed like the fans there were all fake.  Originally, he had over 8,000 fans, but after two days, the number had only dropped by a few dozen.\n\n\n\n  You guys better step it up.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi was angry.\n\n\n\n  He checked the backstage for two days in a row, and by today, Guo Qi had lost the motivation to check it. He estimated that there wouldn't be any changes.\n\n\n\n  He even suspected that these might be fake fans he had bought himself back then?\n\n\n\n  【滴滴】\n\n\n\n  A notification sound. The long-lost system appeared in Guo Qi's mind.\n\n\n\n  【Prompt: When the system counts fans, it will automatically remove invalid fans. The host does not need to consider this situation.】\n\n\n\n  \"You're pretty intelligent,\" Guo Qi clicked confirm, saw the system page disappear, and lay back down to contemplate.\n\n\n\n  The fan loss effect on CAPO was minimal. He hadn't dared to do anything on Weibo these two days, and his fans remained steadily at over 20,000.\n\n\n\n  It seems like losing fans this week is hopeless.\n\n\n\n  While he was worrying, music sounded from outside the window. The campus radio station began broadcasting its morning program.\n\n\n\n  \"Hello, students, welcome to Jiangda Voice's 'Cha Tongxue de Shaonian' program. Today, we will bring you a story that has recently moved countless netizens, the inspirational experience of our peer, Cheng Hao.\"\n\n\n\n  \"From radio host Taozi's 'Zai Renjian' episode one: Finding My Skate Shoes.\"\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  \"What?\"\n\n\n\n  Hearing the words \"skate shoes, skate shoes,\" Guo Qi suddenly had a bad feeling.\n\n\n\n  He perked up his ears and listened carefully.\n\n\n\n  Taozi's gentle voice sounded with the music, like a gentle spring breeze.\n\n\n\n  \"Having been a radio host for many years, I've encountered...\"\n\n\n\n  \"It's a pretty touching story, thankfully it has nothing to do with my song, I'm so scared...\" Guo Qi had just breathed a sigh of relief when he heard the song Taozi used to conclude the story.\n\n\n\n  It was \"My Skate Shoes.\"\n\n\n\n  \"臥槽!!!\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi's small head was filled with big question marks. He was shocked by Taozi's bold operation.\n\n\n\n  Big sister, who are you? Why are you targeting me? How did my niche song, by such a niche singer, get dug up from a dusty corner?\n\n\n\n  What's even more deadly is that big sister's imagination is so wild. How could such an ordinary, crappy song be interpreted as the pursuit of dreams from an ordinary person?\n\n\n\n  I'm going to be swept up in your rhythm.\n\n\n\n  This is truly harmful.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi instantly lost all sleepiness, quickly sat up from the bed, opened his phone's backstage, and sure enough, it was filled with message prompts from Weibo and CAPO.\n\n\n\n  The number of fans was okay, only a few hundred or so. But the number of song plays had reached several thousand, and the speed was still rising steadily.\n\n\n\n  \"啪\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi slapped his forehead, sighing.\n\n\n\n  The heavens want to destroy me!\n\n\n\n  My rotten luck is too strong! Why do others work hard, produce quality content, and promote themselves tirelessly, yet see no results? My half-assed, casually made content gets popular so easily?\n\n\n\n  To find the culprit, Guo Qi began patiently browsing the comments under the song.\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  \"I heard this song on the radio and was curious, so I searched for it and listened to it repeatedly. At first, I thought it was funny, that there was such a stupid song, but after listening to it more, looking at the lyrics, I felt a sour, urge to cry.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Those who came here following Taozi, please type 1.\"\n\n\n\n  \"I saw a remote-control car before but couldn't afford it. After I started working, I spent a few hundred to buy one, but I wasn't happy at all.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Thanks to Taozi, I found a moving song.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Genuine emotion is eternal art. The original version is definitely low-level in music, but this song perfectly expresses a small person's pursuit and love of life, which is high-level.\"\n\n\n\n  \"The first time I heard it, I treated this song as a joke, but after carefully reading it, I realized that this little brother who pursues his dreams is not easy to write this song.\"\n\n\n\n  \"It moved me to tears! It's so hard to pursue your dreams, and after hearing this, I suddenly feel so many grievances...I'm 38 years old and still struggling desperately for my dreams...I also want to skate out that devilish step...Add oil!\"\n\n\n\n  .......\n\n\n\n  It really is this radio host's fault.\n\n\n\n  Following the clues in the comments section, Guo Qi opened the Alpen Radio where Taozi was stationed.\n\n\n\n  He didn't even need to actively search.\n\n\n\n  On the radio's homepage, \"Today's Recommendation\" was clearly \"Zai Renjian: Finding My Skate Shoes.\"\n\n\n\n  Taozi's gentle and moving voice narrated netizen Cheng Hao's inspirational experience.\n\n\n\n  Now, Alpen Radio's story section is filled with ghost stories, urban erotic legends, or various celebrity gossip scoops...\n\n\n\n  Programs like Taozi's, which tell stories about everyday life, are few and far between, like a clear stream.\n\n\n\n  Coupled with the very down-to-earth theme of the first episode, Cheng Hao's real-life experience is also shocking.\n\n\n\n  So, after a simple promotion on the old program \"Tonight's Heart-to-Heart,\" Taozi's accumulated popularity finally exploded in this program.\n\n\n\n  \"Zai Renjian\" became a hit!\n\n\n\n  As the highlight of the first episode, the theme song \"My Skate Shoes\" also rose with the tide and entered the public's view.\n\n\n\n  After refreshing the system's backstage, looking at the gradually rising play count and fan count on CAPO's homepage...\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi understood: he was powerless to change the situation.\n\n\n\n  But when he thought about the thousands of fans that had increased, ultimately only worth a few hundred yuan, Guo Qi suddenly felt that,\n\n\n\n  The sunlight in the dorm was so harsh.\n\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n\n  \"吱呀\".\n\n\n\n  The door to the dorm opened, and Wang Cheng, Sun Xingzhou, and the others returned after attending the campus recruitment fair.\n\n\n\n  After lunch,\n\n\n\n  At Liu Yu's suggestion, the three of them set up their positions and prepared to play a game, to have a good battle in the canyon.\n\n\n\n  Wang Cheng adjusted the new mouse he had bought for gaming, opened the computer to load the game, turned his head and saw Guo Qi looking pensive, and took the initiative to say, \"Qi ge, do you want to play a game together?\"\n\n\n\n  \"Forget it, you guys go ahead.\"\n\n\n\n  Immersed in sadness, Guo Qi rejected Wang Cheng's invitation.\n\n\n\n  \"Qi ge, you're not yourself, it's been days since you've fought with your brothers.\"\n\n\n\n  \"That's right, people's hearts are scattered, the team is hard to lead.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Cheng ge, don't bring Qi ge lunch next time, he doesn't even want to play games with his brothers.\"\n\n\n\n  Sun Xingzhou and Liu Yu also began to chime in.\n\n\n\n  In the end, unable to withstand the \"enthusiastic\" invitation of his brothers, Guo Qi joined the team.\n\n\n\n  A few minutes later, the familiar scene began to unfold.\n\n\n\n  \"Launch an attack!\"\n\n\n\n  \"臥槽! An ambush!\"\n\n\n\n  \"Retreat, defend the base.\"\n\n\n\n  Soon, it came to the tense and exciting stage of defending the base in the game. The 601 dorm had been playing games together for many years, and they were already used to this kind of result. Liu Yu began to calmly command his brothers to defend the base.\n\n\n\n  \"Xingzhou, protect our shooter!\"\n\n\n\n  \"Qi ge, be careful not to get ganked.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Cheng ge, positioning, pay attention to your positioning! ...Oh, no...Cheng ge, don't engage!......\"\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  In the dazzling light, the crystal exploded again, and a huge \"DEFEATED\" appeared on the screen.\n\n\n\n  Undeniably, Wang Cheng once again became the dorm's recognized scapegoat teammate.\n\n\n\n  Wang Cheng scratched his head embarrassedly, then suddenly remembered something: \"I know! It's because the new mouse feels bad, it affected my performance.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Trash mouse, still calling it a gaming artifact, it's a rip-off! I must go to the game forum and fiercely criticize this mouse brand, so that more consumers won't be cheated.\"\n\n\n\n  This shameless shifting of blame led to a unanimous condemnation of Wang Cheng.\n\n\n\n  But Guo Qi was inspired and suddenly came up with a good strategy.\n\n\n\n  Slapping his thigh, Guo Qi discovered a winning tactic.\n\n\n\n  \"Haters!\""

After receiving an order, the leader will first write the copy, then distribute it to the subordinates through social media.  Both sides settle their wages daily based on the workload.\n\n\n  The group owner will post announcements for tasks, notifying group members when and where to start attacking. After completing the task, they post screenshots in the group to receive red envelopes.\n\n\n  Entry-level members usually get 4 yuan for one attack; veteran black fans won't take such small orders. They wait for big orders: to attack popular stars.\n\n\n  Professional black fans have formed a complete industrial chain: some people are responsible for taking money to attack others, some are responsible for contacting black fan leaders, and at the beginning of the chain are clients with needs.\n\n\n  Those who buy black fans are usually competitors of a certain star or the star's agency.  Being attacked brings exposure; some stars even buy black fans to attack themselves.\n\n\n  As for how to attack, each platform has its own tricks.\n\n\n  On less popular live streaming platforms, the price to attack a streamer until they go offline is 200 yuan, with about 50 people attacking.  The price on popular websites will be correspondingly higher.\n\n\n  Although the entertainment industry in this world is not as developed as it was before time travel, black fans and online water armies are already very common, and channels can easily be found on relevant forums.\n\n\n  Because he's short on cash, Guo Qi doesn't plan to find a professional black fan organization.\n\n\n  As the saying goes: Make your own clothes and food.\n\n\n  His eyes rolled around, and he looked at the cute roommates around him.  They were all high-quality talents who had received nine years of compulsory education.  This little thing should be a piece of cake for them, right?\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n  \"Buzz\"\n\n\n  His phone rang again.\n\n\n  Guo Qi looked down and saw messages from CAPO and Weibo.\n\n\n  He opened the backend page, and the notification messages popped up \"brush brush brush,\" looking unpleasant.\n\n\n  @Eagle Eats Mushrooms, 9671 people liked your work;\n\n\n  @Octopus Who Loves Diving, 825 people reposted your work;\n\n\n  @Jiangnan Junlin, 1590 people followed you;\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n  Staring at these numbers, Guo Qi's eyes narrowed slightly.\n\n\n  Humph,\n\n\n  Let the little fans jump around for a few more days.\n\n\n  Tomorrow is the system settlement; the increase in fans this period is unlikely to change.\n\n\n  Next period, let them taste the power of the black fan method!\n\n\n  The publicity of \"In the World\" brought a lot of traffic to \"My Skate Shoes.\" Apart from works by famous singers, no other newly released songs of the same type could compare.\n\n\n  The excellent data performance quickly attracted the attention of the CAPO recommendation mechanism.\n\n\n  \"Buzz\"\n\n\n  Another notification popped up on his phone.\n\n\n  \"Congratulations! Your work \"My Skate Shoes\" has been recommended to the homepage scene today.  Please do not modify the work during the recommendation period to ensure that the work is in a normal publishing state to avoid affecting the display of the work.\"\n\n\n  CAPO, as a creation platform, was jointly invested in by several large companies in the industry. Therefore, in addition to the platform's huge traffic, major audio-visual production companies will also actively provide it with publicity channels.\n\n\n  The homepage scene recommendation for \"My Skate Shoes\" is located in the middle of the homepage, which is a pretty good recommendation position for a newcomer's work.\n\n\n  In short, another wave of huge traffic is coming.\n\n\n  \"Oh...\"\n\n\n  Seeing the recommendation information, Guo Qi didn't react much.\n\n\n  The magical experiences of these few days have already made him believe that anything is possible in this world.\n\n\n  He closed the program backend and put away his phone.\n\n\n  Let the storm come even fiercer!\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n  The next morning.\n\n\n  The system's first settlement time arrived.\n\n\n  Guo Qi lay in bed, waiting for this moment to arrive.\n\n\n  Originally, this should have been a moment he was incredibly looking forward to, but now he felt a little listless.\n\n\n  The hundreds of thousands that were already in hand, gone!\n\n\n  The few thousand yuan brought by tens of thousands of new fans now seemed unattractive.\n\n\n  No way,\n\n\n  After experiencing storms and waves in life, it's hard to appreciate the small streams of the past.\n\n\n  【Beep Beep】\n\n\n  【Reputation Conversion System Starting…】\n\n\n  A familiar voice rang out.\n\n\n  Due to the settlement day, without Guo Qi actively summoning it, the system page automatically appeared in Guo Qi's mind.\n\n\n  As the subtitles unfolded, a light and ethereal female voice began to broadcast simultaneously.\n\n\n  【Congratulations! You have completed the first phase of the task. Next, the system will conduct verification and settlement】\n\n\n  【Settlement in progress…】\n\n\n  【Please confirm your personal information】\n\n\n  Name: Guo Qi\n\n\n  Original Reputation: 25601\n\n\n  Current Reputation: 47289\n\n\n  Level: V1\n\n\n  Profit Conversion Ratio: 0.1, Loss Conversion Ratio: 100\n\n\n  Reputation Change: 21688 (Increase)\n\n\n  【Starting Wealth Conversion】\n\n\n  【Profit Amount: 2168.8 yuan, already credited】\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n  \"Buzz\"\n\n\n  The phone vibrated, a transaction reminder from China Bank.\n\n\n  【Your card ending in 1183 received a quick payment (Other Income - Other) of 2168.8 yuan, balance 2428.8 yuan】\n\n\n  Seeing the bank's credit notification, Guo Qi's heart twitched.\n\n\n  It shouldn't be this little!\n\n\n  After racking his brains and working hard for a week, he only settled for this little money. The path of gaining fans really has no future.\n\n\n  Now, he has gained 3000 Weibo fans, making it 20886. CAPO is even more exaggerated, directly soaring to 26403, a full two times increase.\n\n\n  Gaining 20,000 fans in a week is a proud achievement for most people.\n\n\n  It's also enviable good luck.\n\n\n  However, for Guo Qi, he dreads this luck.\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n  The screen in his mind continued, and a new task appeared.\n\n\n  【Host's current reputation value (actual number of fans) 47289, exceeding the minimum limit of 5000, the new round of tasks is officially started, this period settlement cycle: 14 days; the system will monitor the host's reputation value changes in real time after 14 days and convert it into the host's personal wealth according to the conversion ratio】\n\n\n  【Host current level V1, additional task activation failed】\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n  \"Why did the additional task fail to activate? How can it be successfully activated?\"\n\n\n  Guo Qi was a little curious.\n\n\n  Hearing his question, a line of words slowly appeared on the screen.\n\n\n  【As the host's level increases, this system will automatically unlock the upgraded version. Please explore the upgrade method yourself.】\n\n\n  Seeing the system's answer, Guo Qi remembered that there was indeed such a prompt when the system was first bound.\n\n\n  Maybe it's some kind of Easter egg function, don't worry about it for now...\n\n\n  Losing fans is important.\n\n\n  The settlement cycle has been extended from 7 days to 14 days, which is much more relaxed. And the number of fans has increased from over 20,000 to over 40,000. With a larger base, the potential for losing fans is also much greater.\n\n\n  Overall, it's safer.\n\n\n  But we can't be careless.\n\n\n  You see, most populations in nature have a herd mentality. When individuals have no choice, they will often follow the choices of the majority.\n\n\n  This is the \"herd effect\" in sociology.\n\n\n  A flock of sheep is a very disorganized organization. They usually bump into each other blindly when they are together, but once a leading sheep moves, the other sheep will follow without hesitation, regardless of whether there may be wolves ahead or better grass nearby.\n\n\n  It's the same with fans.\n\n\n  When there are few fans, it's more difficult to gain new fans. But when the number of fans reaches a certain base, even if there is no value to follow, fans will often easily click the follow button.\n\n\n  People will blindly follow the choices of the majority.\n\n\n  Now there are only 40,000 fans, not enough to make fans blindly follow. If the number of fans reaches 100,000, losing fans will become much more difficult.\n\n\n  Thinking of this, Guo Qi felt that the great undertaking of losing fans seemed urgent again.\n\n\n  He needs to plan and implement it early, before the number of fans surpasses 100,000, to start that...\n\n\n  Black fan plan!"

His car had been driven for a few years and needed replacing, otherwise he'd be teased by Lao Wang and the others at business dinners…\n\n\n\n  And there's the matter of the children, the fees for private international schools are not low…\n\n\n\n  Originally, this wasn't a big deal, the company's business was developing normally, and money wasn't a major problem.\n\n\n\n  But in the past two years, with the rise of the internet, IT companies have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain all over the country.\n\n\n\n  Not only has industry competition intensified, but users' attention has been captured by the internet, and his company, Shi's media GG company, has been severely impacted.\n\n\n\n  Elevator GG, bus GG, building GG…\n\n\n\n  These were once the main GG advertising channels relied upon by local life clients, and clients were plentiful.\n\n\n\n  But in the past year, the company's related business revenue has plummeted.\n\n\n\n  Lao Shi, who is over forty, is quite confused.\n\n\n\n  He has tried several directions, such as online part-time platforms, local information websites, and even spent money on a page game, all ending in dismal failure.\n\n\n\n  Six months ago, he had a few drinks with some big clients, and during their conversation, they talked about: the GG industry has remained unchanged for years, and the recent impact of the internet has actually given birth to some new methods.\n\n\n\n  Exhibition activities, which were previously undervalued, have now become popular.  Everyone wants to try the effect.\n\n\n\n  Based on this, Lao Shi established the Pineapple Entertainment Media Company.\n\n\n\n  Unexpectedly, this step turned out to be a hit.\n\n\n\n  Driven by the CAPO platform and major music and film companies, the entertainment industry has developed rapidly, and concepts such as trainee signings and artists have become widely known to the public.\n\n\n\n  Lao Shi originally wanted to find a few good-looking young men and women to perform at exhibition activities.\n\n\n\n  After recruiting people, wow, it turned out that simply giving them the name of a girl group instantly increased their appearance fees several times.\n\n\n\n  What are you waiting for?\n\n\n\n  Lao Shi quickly instructed his subordinates, and transformed the girls under Pineapple Entertainment into an idol girl group—Pineapple Sister.\n\n\n\n  The sponsors and exhibition organizers fell for it.\n\n\n\n  Regardless of the number of fans or talent, as long as they are good-looking and have great figures, the atmosphere on the scene will be very lively.\n\n\n\n  Soon, the revenue of the Pineapple Sister group became an important source of income for Shi Huakang. Last month, to celebrate the team's six-month anniversary, the team went on vacation to a Hawaiian island.\n\n\n\n  Encouraged by this, Shi Huakang quickly formed a boy group—Happy Boys.\n\n\n\n  He wanted to quickly replicate the success of Pineapple Sister, but the market response was cold.\n\n\n\n  For two consecutive months, there were only a few performance invitations. Compared to Pineapple Sister's constant invitations, Happy Boys were anything but happy.\n\n\n\n  What's going on?\n\n\n\n  After assigning his subordinates to conduct a diligent research report, Lao Shi understood.\n\n\n\n  In just half a year, there were many entertainment companies like his that had tasted success, and traditional large institutions in the industry, such as Ku Gua Entertainment and Happy Transmission, also accelerated their expansion.\n\n\n\n  The artists they chose were either proficient in singing, playing, and dancing, or had superb dancing skills and stunning stage presence. After professional training and promotion by the company, the group's strength was far superior to his Happy Boys.\n\n\n\n  What to do?\n\n\n\n  Shi Huakang finished his buns, took a wet wipe and wiped his mouth.\n\n\n\n  Raising a boy group costs a lot of money. Should he continue to invest and sign some more outstanding members to make up for the shortcomings, or should he simply give up on the boy group market?\n\n\n\n  The boy group market is the core of the idol group market.\n\n\n\n  But if the investment fails, he will lose a lot of money.\n\n\n\n  \"嘟嘟嘟…\"\n\n\n\n  Shi Huakang was still thinking when his phone rang in his pocket.\n\n\n\n  The call was from Chen Xiangyang, the film and television department manager of Pineapple Entertainment.\n\n\n\n  Shi Huakang answered the phone: \"Hello, Lao Chen, what's up?\"\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Shi, good news!\"\n\n\n\n  On the other end of the phone, Chen Xiangyang said excitedly.\n\n\n\n  \"We've found a treasure!\"\n\n\n\n  Lao Chen had followed him in his entrepreneurial journey for many years, and his ability and character were excellent; he was one of his trusted aides. Seeing his excitement, Shi Huakang was also aroused.\n\n\n\n  He pretended to scold him, jokingly saying: \"What, did you win the lottery?  Get to the point. I'm eating.\"\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang didn't get angry, and laughed: \"Mr. Shi, although I didn't win the lottery, as long as we seize the opportunity, Pineapple Entertainment might earn tens of millions.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Really?\"\n\n\n\n  Shi Huakang was somewhat doubtful, tens of millions was no small sum for him.\n\n\n\n  \"Lao Chen, what treasure did we find?\"\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Shi, it's a long story, I'll tell you when you come to the office.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Okay, I'll be right there.\"\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\n  After hanging up the phone, Shi Huakang no longer had the mood to continue eating, quickly wiped his mouth, and went to the office.\n\n\n\n  As soon as he opened the door, Lao Chen was already waiting for him in the office with a computer.\n\n\n\n  Seeing Shi Huakang come in, Lao Chen opened his phone screen, clicked on Alps FM, and found Taozi's name in the list of newly popular hosts.\n\n\n\n  Taozi had already struck while the iron was hot and updated the second episode of content, but Lao Chen opened the first episode, \"In the Human World: Searching for Skate Shoes,\" and dragged the progress bar directly to the song part.\n\n\n\n  Listening to the melody on the radio, Shi Huakang was a little puzzled: \"Lao Chen, this song is…?\"\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang smiled slightly: \"Mr. Shi, this song has become a little famous on Alps these two days, it's called \"My Skate Shoes,\" and the person who created it is called Guo Qi.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Guo Qi?\"\n\n\n\n  Shi Huakang pondered the name: \"It sounds familiar…\"\n\n\n\n  \"Yes, this Guo Qi once submitted a resume, and you interviewed him,\" Chen Xiangyang reminded.\n\n\n\n  \"Oh, I remember now,\"\n\n\n\n  Shi Huakang slapped his forehead: \"That's right, the young man is pretty good, and he looks energetic. I just thought his name wasn't good, what's with a name like Guo Qi (literally 'past glory') in the entertainment industry…\"\n\n\n\n  Saying this, he took Chen Xiangyang's phone and carefully looked at Taozi's program data, then opened CAPO and searched for the song \"My Skate Shoes.\"\n\n\n\n  After looking at the page data, Shi Huakang was slightly surprised.\n\n\n\n  \"Wow, this Guo Qi is quite popular these days, his data is better than our entire boy group combined.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Yes, Mr. Shi,\" Lao Chen chimed in.\n\n\n\n  \"Fortunately, we only asked him to wait for news last month and didn't send him a rejection letter in time. I checked his Weibo and CAPO, the young man is better than we imagined; with some packaging, he has a chance to become a small star.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Okay, Lao Chen, contact Xiao Guo personally and sign him as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n\n  With this opportunity, the matter that Shi Huakang had been agonizing over for several days was settled. He decided to gamble again and continue to invest to see if the boy group could make a splash.\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\n  With Guo Qi's emergence online,\n\n\n\n  Entertainment companies with recruitment intentions were not just Pineapple Entertainment.\n\n\n\n  Although for large companies like Ku Gua, Guo Qi's fan data was not worth paying attention to, after all, many amateurs had a lot of fans before applying for signing.\n\n\n\n  But for small and medium-sized companies, Guo Qi's data performance was still worth courting.\n\n\n\n  Xin Feng Media, which had previously rejected Guo Qi, was among them.\n\n\n\n  A strange number called, Guo Qi answered the phone, and a gentle female voice came from the other end.\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Guo, hello, I'm Wang Yiqun, an assistant in the film and television department of Xin Feng Media who contacted you some time ago.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Are you still interested in signing with our company?\""

    "content": "新風傳媒？\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi picked up the phone and froze in place.\n\n\n\n  He had a strong impression of this company.\n\n\n\n  It was the rejection letter from Xin Feng Media that crushed the original Guo Qi's belief, causing the original Guo Qi to go on a drunken binge at a bar.\n\n\n\n  Strange,\n\n\n\n  Since they rejected him before, why are they extending an olive branch again?\n\n\n\n  It's probably because \"My Skate Shoes\" has gained some popularity on Alps FM, and the company has seen its potential to become a hit.\n\n\n\n  Humph, you opportunists.\n\n\n\n  Yesterday you ignored me, today I'm too good for you.\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  \"Hello, Mr. Guo?\"\n\n\n\n  On the other end of the phone, Wang Yiqun, seeing that there was no response for a long time, thought that Guo Qi hadn't been moved by his invitation, and with a hardened heart, he upped the ante.\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Guo, the previous rejection was a misunderstanding. After re-evaluation by our interview selection officers, your final comprehensive assessment is A-level.  We can waive the training fees, and you will also receive a monthly subsidy of 8,000 yuan.\"\n\n\n\n  \"8,000 yuan subsidy?\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi was somewhat surprised by Xin Feng's generosity.\n\n\n\n  For a fresh graduate, this is already a good salary. Moreover, this is the compensation offered by an entertainment company to a trainee.\n\n\n\n  It's top-tier conscientiousness in the industry.\n\n\n\n  In his past life, due to his profession, Guo Qi had some understanding of the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n  Although trainees sound glamorous, their actual lives are quite miserable. A monthly salary of 800 yuan is standard practice, a monthly salary of 3,000-5,000 yuan is already considered conscientious, and those with a monthly salary of over 6,000 yuan either have outstanding qualifications or the company is very wealthy and willing to spend money to cultivate them.\n\n\n\n  Usually, people who become trainees are those from well-off families, and a small portion are children from poor families pursuing their dreams while enduring poverty.\n\n\n\n  For Xin Feng Media to offer a monthly salary of 8,000 yuan to recruit Guo Qi is indeed very sincere.\n\n\n\n  Unfortunately, Guo Qi doesn't intend to sign.\n\n\n\n  Nonsense,\n\n\n\n  If he joins an entertainment company, the probability of becoming famous is even greater, so how can he lose fans and make money?\n\n\n\n  Even if becoming a popular idol can make money, unless the fame is very high, most stars' income is not as substantial as the public imagines. Correspondingly, they have to pay a lot for it.\n\n\n\n  For example, being controlled by these entertainment companies, they can't even have a public relationship...\n\n\n\n  If he doesn't become famous, it's even worse,\n\n\n\n  Not to mention earning money, he would also waste his youth in the entertainment company.  When encountering popular artists from the same company, he would inevitably have to bow and scrape and be suppressed.\n\n\n\n  Why bother?\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  \"Yes, 8,000 yuan per month.\"\n\n\n\n  Wang Yiqun heard Guo Qi's reply and felt a little encouraged, thinking that this young man could be swayed by money, so he quickly painted a beautiful picture.\n\n\n\n  \"Rest assured, in addition to this, if you perform excellently in the company's selection, you can also get the opportunity to be packaged for debut.\"\n\n\n\n  \"We will introduce top industry mentors to pave the way for you, and provide comprehensive course training.  I believe you will be able to debut and become famous in Xin Feng very quickly, and then you will be earning enough for mansions and luxury cars…\"\n\n\n\n  What?\n\n\n\n  You guys actually plan to invest heavily in packaging me?\n\n\n\n  This is incredible!\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi quickly rejected Wang Yiqun's proposal.\n\n\n\n  \"I'm sorry, due to my personal career planning, I'm not considering signing with an agency at the moment.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Is that so?\"\n\n\n\n  Wang Yiqun was a little surprised, thinking that Guo Qi had additional requirements for the terms, and continued to persuade, \"Mr. Guo, if there are any aspects of the terms that you are dissatisfied with, we can still discuss them.\"\n\n\n\n  \"I'm very satisfied, but my personal plan is not to become an artist.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Okay then, Mr. Guo can consider it again for the next couple of days. If you need anything, you can contact me anytime.\"\n\n\n\n  Wang Yiqun suppressed his disappointment and hung up the phone gently.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi also breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\n  Immediately afterwards, another phone rang.\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Guo Qi, this is Qise Guangying Shi…\"\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  \"I'm sorry, due to my personal planning…\"\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  Then came the next phone call.\n\n\n\n  \"Hi, Guo Qi baby, I'm Jesse from Jieluoya Film and Television…\"\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  \"I'm sorry, due to my personal…\"\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  In just half a day, Guo Qi received five calls from film and television media companies.\n\n\n\n  Seeing this enthusiastic pursuit, he almost thought that he hadn't just become popular on the Alps platform, but had just won an Oscar.\n\n\n\n  Come to think of it,\n\n\n\n  Why are these film and television media companies' scouts like salespeople?\n\n\n\n  He thought scouts would be aloof and very classy.\n\n\n\n  Thinking of this, Guo Qi suddenly remembered the capable and beautiful woman he met at the bar a few days ago.\n\n\n\n  That girl named Gu Tang is more in line with his image of a scout.\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  Kugu Entertainment headquarters building.\n\n\n\n  Gu Tang closed her laptop, picked up the water cup on her desk, and took a few sips of goji berry tea.\n\n\n\n  Then, she leaned back in her chair, exhausted.\n\n\n\n  Finally done.\n\n\n\n  Her recent performance has been good, and a promotion to the small group manager of the film and television department this year is basically a sure thing.\n\n\n\n  Her department head, Sister Wei, has always taken good care of her, and this time she specifically arranged a project with great results for her, connecting with Penguin Video's latest variety show \"Idol's Birth\".\n\n\n\n  This show is touted as China's first idol competition and cultivation reality show, with a very novel format.\n\n\n\n  Although there are currently no comparable programs domestically, it's unknown how the market will react, but similar program formats have received good audience feedback in South Korea, Europe, and the United States.\n\n\n\n  Penguin Video has high expectations for this program.\n\n\n\n  They are investing heavily in its production, and the mentors hired are all highly paid industry bigwigs. In addition, they have also put a lot of effort into program production and publicity and promotion.\n\n\n\n  According to the casting director who contacted Gu Tang, in order to record the program, Penguin Video contacted no less than 200 domestic and foreign brokerage companies.\n\n\n\n  Before the end of the month, the program will select 100 contestants from thousands of contestants from over 200 entertainment brokerage companies, and in the following six months of closed training, based on audience voting results, select the final seven contestants to form a debut group.\n\n\n\n  After the group debuts, it will receive joint promotion from Penguin Video and the artists' respective brokerage companies.\n\n\n\n  Gu Tang believes that this seven-member group selected from the talent show will become the undisputed top traffic in China in the next few years.\n\n\n\n  The executives of Kugu Entertainment obviously share this view, and they are very concerned about the list of contestants to be selected for this program.\n\n\n\n  They revised it again and again, and pondered it repeatedly…\n\n\n\n  As the person in charge of the selection, Gu Tang has already submitted the list of contestants five times.\n\n\n\n  Fortunately, her efforts were not in vain.\n\n\n\n  Just now, the bosses finally reached a consensus and approved the final list.\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  \"Buzz buzz\"\n\n\n\n  Her phone rang, and someone sent a WeChat message.\n\n\n\n  Gu Tang opened her phone and found it was Taozi.\n\n\n\n  \"Dear, are you busy? I have something to ask you.\"\n\n\n\n  \"What's up, Sister Taozi?\"\n\n\n\n  \"That… your artist, Guo Qi, does he have any new song plans recently?\"\n\n\n\n  Seeing this question, Gu Tang immediately understood.\n\n\n\n  It's all because she didn't explain clearly earlier, causing Taozi to misunderstand.\n\n\n\n  After thinking for a while, Gu Tang quickly explained.\n\n\n\n  \"I'm sorry, Sister Taozi, it's all my fault for not explaining clearly. This Guo Qi is someone I saw at a bar, I think he has potential and his songs are interesting. He is not yet my signed artist.\"\n\n\n\n  \"…Is that so?\" Taozi was a little surprised by this result.\n\n\n\n  \"It doesn't matter, I just wanted to ask if he's releasing any new songs recently, I can continue to promote him for free on the show.\""

But the playback data was still slightly lower than the first episode.\n\n\n\n  Some fans even commented that without a soul-stirring song like \"My Skate Shoes,\" the show lacked something.\n\n\n\n  Seeing the feedback from the backstage, Taozi, who was preparing to record the third episode, was stumped.\n\n\n\n  The story was already ready, telling the stories of young men and women meeting and missing each other in the city, the title being \"In the Human World: Young Love Story.\"\n\n\n\n  But when it came to choosing the song, Taozi hesitated.\n\n\n\n  Logically, in today's music scene, where saccharine songs are rampant, there's no shortage of songs about love and romance.\n\n\n\n  But after searching high and low…\n\n\n\n  How should I put it,\n\n\n\n  Just like what the netizens commented,\n\n\n\n  It lacked soul.\n\n\n\n  Taozi didn't have Gu Tang's contact information, so she decided to ask Gu Tang to inquire.\n\n\n\n  Fortunately, Guo Qi was still an unknown 18th-tier artist, and he should really need this kind of promotion channel… right?\n\n\n\n  One to improve the quality of the show, and one to promote their new song,\n\n\n\n  This was a win-win situation.\n\n\n\n  Taozi thought so, and sent a message to Gu Tang.\n\n\n\n  \"Dearest, can you ask Guo Qi when his new song will be released?\"\n\n\n\n  \"If not, inviting a song would also work, we can discuss the price together.\"\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\n  \"Sister Taozi, don't worry, I'll pass your thoughts on to him, and I'll get back to you then.\"\n\n\n\n  After ending the chat with Taozi,\n\n\n\n  Gu Tang found that her drowsiness had completely disappeared.\n\n\n\n  This Guo Qi, his new song actually had such great potential?\n\n\n\n  She turned on her computer and quickly searched for Guo Qi's homepage on the CAPO platform and Weibo.\n\n\n\n  On Weibo, he played the role of a funny video blogger, while on CAPO, he adopted a unique creator style…\n\n\n\n  His approach was a bit wild,\n\n\n\n  I didn't expect you to be such a treasure boy,\n\n\n\n  Giving a mental compliment,\n\n\n\n  Gu Tang called Guo Qi's phone.\n\n\n\n  \"Du…\"\n\n\n\n  After a busy tone, a cold mechanical female voice reminded her.\n\n\n\n  \"Hello, the user you dialed is busy now, please call again later…\n\n\n\n  Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is busy now. Please call again late…\"\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\n  Jiangzhou University, Dorm 601.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi paced on the balcony, listening to the person on the phone introducing themselves.\n\n\n\n  \"Xiao Guo, hello, I'm Chen Xiangyang, the general manager of the film and television department of Pineapple Entertainment. We've met at the company before.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Hello, Mr. Guo.\"\n\n\n\n  \"I'm calling today to congratulate you on passing our selection assessment and officially becoming a signed artist under Pineapple Entertainment…\"\n\n\n\n  \"I'm sorry, due to personal…\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi suddenly paused halfway through his refusal.\n\n\n\n  Huh, what the heck?\n\n\n\n  Other people ask for opinions, but this Chen Xiangyang doesn't play by the rules, he starts by congratulating me…\n\n\n\n  Congratulations your big head,\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi muttered in his heart, politely refusing on the surface: \"Mr. Chen, are you mistaken?\"\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang chuckled on the phone: \"No mistake, let's sign the contract.\"\n\n\n\n  \"It's like this, due to changes in my personal plans, I've already given up on pursuing a career as an entertainer.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Don't consider it again?\"\n\n\n\n  \"I won't consider it.\"\n\n\n\n  Hearing such a decisive refusal, Chen Xiangyang burst into laughter instead. He said loudly: \"Xiao Guo, you're a talent, and Pineapple Entertainment is also a very good and conscientious platform, we welcome the joining of outstanding talents. I advise you to consider it carefully again.\"\n\n\n\n  \"I've already considered it carefully.\" Guo Qi frowned, his tone firm.\n\n\n\n  Since things have come to this, why is this Chen Xiangyang still being so persistent,\n\n\n\n  Like a spineless lickspittle.\n\n\n\n  \"Okay then,\" Chen Xiangyang sighed, asking, \"Are you by your computer now?\"\n\n\n\n  \"It's right in front of me.\" Guo Qi was a little confused.\n\n\n\n  \"Oh, that's great, please open Pineapple Entertainment's official website and look at the last statement in the registration instructions.\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi resisted the urge to hang up the phone and opened the webpage to search.\n\n\n\n  The registration channel was in a prominent position on the official website, clicking on \"Registration Instructions\" to view the complete terms and conditions.\n\n\n\n  Then Guo Qi was stunned.\n\n\n\n  Damn it,\n\n\n\n  Is this scheme this deep?\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\n  The statement clearly stated:\n\n\n\n  【…I agree that after completing the online registration, I will automatically become a candidate signed artist of this company (website main body company), unless you receive a rejection letter from this company or do not sign a contract with this company within 30 days, otherwise you will abide by the contract terms…\n\n\n\n  If you violate the agreement, you need to compensate this company with a penalty of 200,000 (two hundred thousand yuan) in full。】\n\n\n\n  Seeing Guo Qi's silence, Chen Xiangyang spoke.\n\n\n\n  \"So, Xiao Guo, how are you going to pay the penalty?\"\n\n\n\n  \"…\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi gritted his teeth.\n\n\n\n  200,000 yuan was no small sum for him now.\n\n\n\n  It's all because the original owner was too naive and didn't know the dangers of society!\n\n\n\n  On second thought, normal people who register, who would seriously read the registration terms?\n\n\n\n  It's still Pineapple Entertainment's fault for being too cunning!\n\n\n\n  This time, he seemed to have fallen for it.\n\n\n\n  Fortunately, in his impression, this Pineapple Entertainment was a small company with no resources in the industry. Even if he was signed, the probability of becoming popular was not high.\n\n\n\n  While he just signed the contract, he needed to start losing fans as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n  As long as he lost more than 2,000 fans, the 200,000 yuan penalty would be negligible.\n\n\n\n  Thoughts flashed through his mind quickly, Guo Qi made up his mind.\n\n\n\n  A good man doesn't suffer immediate losses, let's get through this first.\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\n  \"喂, Xiao Guo, can you hear me?\"\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang muttered to himself on the phone: \"Is my signal not very good.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Ahem, I can hear you.\"\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi suppressed his anger.\n\n\n\n  \"Mr. Chen, I've just carefully read the official website, your grand vision has deeply attracted me. I've decided to revise my life plan, join Pineapple Entertainment, and work together to change the entertainment industry!\"\n\n\n\n  \"That's great, it's a win-win situation!\"\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang said with conviction.\n\n\n\n  \"Xiao Guo, when are you free to come to the company to handle the procedures? I represent Pineapple Entertainment, and we welcome your arrival with open arms!\"\n\n\n\n  \"Thank you, Mr. Guo, see you tomorrow!\"\n\n\n\n  \"It's a deal.\"\n\n\n\n  Hanging up the phone.\n\n\n\n  Guo Qi spat.\n\n\n\n  \"This old fox!\"\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\n  Jiangzhou Limin Plaza.\n\n\n\n  Building C, 12th floor, where Pineapple Entertainment is located.\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang hung up the phone and went to Shi Huakang's office.\n\n\n\n  \"Knock knock knock.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Come in.\"\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang pushed open the door and saw Shi Huakang sitting in front of the computer, smoking a cigarette.\n\n\n\n  \"Manager Shi, I've just finished talking with Guo Qi, it went very smoothly. He'll come over to sign the contract tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n  \"That's great, he's a good seedling, Lao Chen, see how to arrange him, anyway, we need to cultivate him well. By the way…\"\n\n\n\n  Shi Huakang flicked off the ash, flipped through a stack of documents on the desk, and spread them out in front of Chen Xiangyang.\n\n\n\n  \"Lao Chen, take a look at this.\"\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang took a closer look, it was the program recruitment form, selecting people for a program called \"Idol Birth.\"\n\n\n\n  Although he didn't quite understand what kind of idol competition and cultivation reality show this was, he still recognized the four words \"Penguin Video.\"\n\n\n\n  This is the video platform established by the Internet giant Penguin Group, and it is also the main initiator and important shareholder of the current entertainment audio-visual platform CAPO.\n\n\n\n  The programs they invest resources in developing have a high probability of becoming popular.\n\n\n\n  \"Manager Shi, where did you get this?\" Chen Xiangyang was a little excited.\n\n\n\n  \"The program selection director is an old classmate of mine.\"\n\n\n\n  Shi Huakang exhaled a puff of smoke and smiled, \"Don't you think we're lucky?\"\n\n\n\n  Speaking of which, he handed the registration form to Chen Xiangyang: \"Organize the information of our male artists, make it look good, and I'll send it to him to see if he can be selected.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Don't worry, Manager Shi, I'll package it well.\"\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang took the documents and returned to his seat seriously.\n\n\n\n  This program is a male group selection, Pineapple Entertainment is very small, and only has one low-profile Happy Boys group.\n\n\n\n  There are 4 current members: Liu Ranxi, Wang Chao, Zhou Zheng, Xu Yiran.\n\n\n\n  Chen Xiangyang thought for a moment,\n\n\n\n  Since Guo Qi has also signed, and he is also a key seed that Manager Shi focuses on, let's put him up there too.\n\n\n\n  He turned to the fifth page of the registration form.\n\n\n\n  He filled in the two words \"Guo Qi.\""

    "content": "第二天上午，郭齊根據入職指南來到利民廣場。\n\n\n  雖然心裡不情願，但20萬違約金髮出的神秘力量催動他來到此處。\n\n\n  菠蘿娛樂位於利民大廈C座12樓。\n\n\n  剛走出電梯，就看到旁邊立著碩大的菠蘿Logo。\n\n\n  郭齊走進大門，聽到前台有人問話。\n\n\n  「同志，幹什麼的，過來簽下字。」\n\n\n  迎著聲音望去，櫃檯後面站著面容嚴肅的老大爺。\n\n\n  竟然是前台大爺.......\n\n\n  雖說大爺比小姐姐要更有性價比，但好歹你也是一家娛樂公司，能不能講點排面？\n\n\n  郭齊腹誹兩句。\n\n\n  走上前在簽到本上填寫信息。\n\n\n  「你是過來入職的，辦公區進門靠右。」看到郭齊的登記信息，大爺熱情指路。\n\n\n  「謝謝。」\n\n\n  道了聲謝，郭齊按照指引來到了陳向陽坐鎮的辦公室。\n\n\n  菠蘿娛樂場地不大，總共不到三百平。\n\n\n  其中有小半面積，劃給了石華康原來的GG媒體公司—巨火GG。\n\n\n  剩下的，除了正常的總經理辦公室以及會客區，還為男團女團劃定了訓練室，所以空出來的辦公區域並不大，大概是四十多平。\n\n\n  除了女團組合菠蘿蜜兒和男團組合快樂少年團，菠蘿娛樂的職能人員人數不多，主要負責組合商務合作洽談，團隊宣傳包裝等工作。\n\n\n  十來個人分散在四十多平的地方，並不顯得擁擠。\n\n\n  陳向陽位置在最裡面，用隔板區分了個小辦公室。\n\n\n  見郭齊進來，陳向陽趕緊招呼旁邊那個容貌俏美身材高挑的女孩兒。\n\n\n  「來，我介紹一下，這位是咱們公司新簽約的藝人郭齊，畢業自江州大學，同時也是具備很強的表演能力和創作能力。目前在微博和CAPO上都吸引了不少關注。」\n\n\n  他拍了拍郭齊肩膀，語重心長地說：「公司對你也很重視，這是為你配備的助理，蘇嵐。」\n\n\n  「小蘇人也非常優秀，你們好好熟悉下。」\n\n\n  蘇嵐臉色通紅，似乎有些害羞。\n\n\n  見陳向陽走遠，她熱情的伸出右手。\n\n\n  郭齊伸出手握了握。\n\n\n  「嘶……」\n\n\n  郭齊痛的吸了下嘴角。\n\n\n  手指都快被捏紅了，\n\n\n  長得這麼白淨，手勁兒真大。\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n  在蘇嵐的引導下，郭齊很快走完入職流程，也基本熟悉了菠蘿娛樂的公司構造。\n\n\n  正常情況下，練習生加入娛樂公司後，會交給公司一定的培訓訓練費用。\n\n\n  公司會在簽約以後，對練習生的才藝進行評級，分入對行的A B C D等班級。\n\n\n  D班最差，A班最優。\n\n\n  之後，娛樂公司會每月安排月考，對練習生級別進行重新評定。\n\n\n  如果連續半年都在D班，那麼就會被娛樂公司解約，失去練習生的資格。\n\n\n  反之，如果表現優異，連續半年都在A班，就會被評定為待出道成員，等待公司安排時機宣布出道。\n\n\n  每月得考核非常嚴苛，所以正規娛樂公司的練習生們每天都會拼命練習，幾乎把所有時間都會耗費在練習室，從而爭取來之不易的出道機會。\n\n\n  然而在菠蘿娛樂，這些問題統統都不存在。\n\n\n  由於整個公司就這麼兩撥人，菠蘿娛樂在業內也沒有包裝宣傳的資源和人脈。因此根本不存在所謂的出道機會，練習生一旦選入，就可以成為組合正式成員。\n\n\n  沒辦法，\n\n\n  酷瓜和藍色天空等業內知名公司，擁有豐厚的行業資源和雄厚的師資條件，練習生們為了出道走紅，是心甘情願繳納培訓費。\n\n\n  而菠蘿娛樂這種小公司，手頭沒什麼資源。如果也和大公司一樣收費，恐怕根本不會有什麼人報名。\n\n\n  所以菠蘿娛樂他們通常採取的是僱傭制。每月會發放一定薪資，維持成員正常生活，同時利用組合成員的商務演出費用進行營利。\n\n\n  因為自身沒有培養訓練藝人的能力，為了保障組合能夠盈利，小娛樂公司在選拔時通常選擇有一定才藝的成員。\n\n\n  普通人選進來賺不到錢，每月還要發生活補助，很吃虧的。\n\n\n  為了防止成員退出，影響組合正常運轉，通常小公司會約定高額違約金。\n\n\n  如果有商務演出，經紀人會帶著組合成員一起準備。每場演出，公司抽取45%，剩下的組合和經紀人按照比例劃分。\n\n\n  像菠蘿蜜兒這種商演邀約不斷的組合，每月收入也算比較豐厚。\n\n\n  而快樂少年團這種門面冷清的冷門組合，成員們就相當慘了。每月3000左右的生活補助費也就只夠吃飯。\n\n\n  為了增加收入，在別的公司練習生努力訓練時，快樂少年團的四名少年正在訓練室.......\n\n\n  在歪歪平台表演。\n\n\n  短視頻尚未崛起，直播方興未艾，從遊戲公會聊天工具起家的歪歪平台正逐漸站穩直播界前三的位置。\n\n\n  只是用戶雖多，主播更多。\n\n\n  唱歌的，跳舞的，漏胸的，抖腿的，各路大神為了博取眼球無所不用其極。\n\n\n  快樂少年團的直播間常年冷冷清清。\n\n\n  總之，非常的慘。\n\n\n  ......\n\n\n  了解了基本情況，郭齊感覺踏實多了。\n\n\n  不愧是創業公司，\n\n\n  處處都流露著不靠譜的亞子。\n\n\n  沒有資源，沒有機制，沒有人才，這種情況下，想火真的是非常困難。\n\n\n  起碼在這種環境下，只要不做太出格的事，粉絲應該是不會再增加了。\n\n\n  更妙的是，快樂少年團平日裡也沒有商演，時間會很寬裕，毫不影響自己去搞掉粉的騷操作。\n\n\n  郭齊非常滿意。\n\n\n  領取完必需的工作材料，回到位置剛坐下，蘇嵐就遞過來一份旺旺迷你蛋糕。\n\n\n  不愧是貼心的藝人小助理。\n\n\n  有這麼一個美女當跟班的感覺，還挺不錯。\n\n\n  郭齊接過蛋糕，對蘇嵐增加了不少好感。\n\n\n  「謝謝。」\n\n\n  「不用客氣。」蘇嵐溫柔說道，然後指了下陳向陽的位置。\n\n\n  「齊哥，陳總讓你找下他。」\n\n\n  .....\n\n\n  走到辦公室，郭齊發現屋裡多個了花襯衫留小鬍鬚的男人。\n\n\n  見郭齊進來，陳向陽指著那個男人介紹道：「小郭啊，這是江州有名的金牌經紀人，吳優先生。」\n\n\n  「不敢當，不敢當。」吳優嘴上推辭，臉上表情卻顯得十分受用。\n\n\n  「吳先生一手促成了COLA7和sweetboy組合的走紅，公司為了包裝你，專門聘請了他做你的經紀顧問。你可要好好珍惜。」\n\n\n  金牌經紀人？\n\n\n  郭齊面色微變。\n\n\n  這可要小心了，\n\n\n  對這個吳優以後一定要陽奉陰違。"

    "content": "「Mr. Wu, this is Guo Qi. Little Guo is very talented, and he has quite a few fans on Weibo and CAPO.」\n\n\nMr. Wu closed his eyes and nodded slightly after hearing Chen Xiangyang's introduction.\n\n\nA demeanor befitting a top industry figure.\n\n\nHe had read Guo Qi's profile.\n\n\nHe had a rather deep impression.\n\n\nOver 20,000 Weibo followers, and less than 30,000 CAPO followers, totaling over 40,000.\n\n\nTo be honest, this number is not outstanding for a newcomer.\n\n\nMany trainee artists from large companies have this level of following. Some monstrously talented individuals even have millions of followers before their debut.\n\n\nWu You knew clearly: This data alone is insufficient to indicate that a trainee artist has great potential.\n\n\nTherefore, when he first received the consultant invitation from Pineapple Entertainment, Wu You actually refused.\n\n\nIt wasn't that Pineapple Entertainment's offer wasn't tempting, but he was apprehensive about this job as a talent manager consultant.\n\n\nAlthough he is now called a top talent manager in Jiangzhou, having successfully promoted the two major girl groups COLA7 and sweetgirls, his resume is quite impressive.\n\n\nBut what's embarrassing is that Wu You himself doesn't understand the reasons for the groups' success.\n\n\nBecause he is a big slacker.\n\n\nHe has come this far entirely due to luck.\n\n\nWu You's career as a talent manager began at Xingkong Culture.\n\n\nXingkong Culture is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xingkong Media, a local media giant.\n\n\nA few years ago, personal computers had already become commonplace, the concept of the Internet was burgeoning, and the entertainment industry was also embracing the Internet+ concept. Based on this situation, the company decided to increase investment in Internet entertainment, attempting to secure a place in the market.\n\n\nBecause of its focus on the \"Internet entertainment\" concept, Xingkong Culture's attempt was also highly internet-oriented.\n\n\nFirst, online auditions, a novel concept, attracted many applicants.\n\n\nAfter several rounds of screening, 7 members with excellent singing and dancing skills were selected by the company to form the girl group COLA7.\n\n\nDue to the positive market feedback from the online auditions, Xingkong Culture was greatly encouraged and immediately organized an online audition for talent managers.\n\n\nThis was a very risky move.\n\n\nBecause the skills of a talent manager have a significant impact on the success of a new idol.\n\n\nStars are like beautifully packaged goods. How to sell them well and at the best price is a test of the talent manager's and agency's abilities.\n\n\nIt can be said that a significant part of a star's success is attributed to the talent manager. An unreliable talent manager can easily lead to overall failure.\n\n\nAt that time, Wu You was still studying market marketing at Jiangzhou Normal University.\n\n\nHaving failed both the postgraduate entrance examination and the civil service examination, he was idly surfing the internet, looking for job postings and submitting resumes.\n\n\nWhen he saw the online audition for talent managers, he was immediately attracted by the cash prize and job offer for the winner.\n\n\nAlthough he didn't even have a talent manager qualification certificate, Wu You, in a moment of enthusiasm, used all his persuasive skills to write a lengthy talent management plan of over 10,000 words.\n\n\nIn his plan, he integrated the 4C/4P theory, positioning theory, integrated marketing, and CCM theory...\n\n\nAfter a flurry of fanciful talk, the young girl group COLA7 would become China's version of Girls' Generation through the power of the Internet.\n\n\nRelying on his exceptional ability in paper planning and his fervent promotion of the Internet concept, Wu You successfully convinced the judges and became the signed talent manager for COLA7.\n\n\nWithout any experience or resources as a talent manager,\n\n\nWu You couldn't compete with other companies for the television and radio promotions and commercial performances that new groups frequently participate in, and he only got marginal resources.\n\n\nResources like GG endorsements and television variety shows were nowhere to be seen.\n\n\nAfter several months, the girl group's development showed no signs of improvement, and discontent began to brew within the group.\n\n\nAt this time, due to the influence of the previous online auditions, several online variety shows came knocking.\n\n\nAt that time, the concept of online variety shows was just emerging, unlike later, when a large number of video platforms participated, ensuring the viewership and exposure of the programs. At that time, most online variety shows were produced by film and television companies that couldn't get broadcast resources on terrestrial television and therefore tried to use internet channels to build influence.\n\n\nAt that time, many industry insiders still viewed the Internet with colored labels such as \"grassroots\" and \"uncultured,\" questioning the effectiveness of online programs, and did not take them seriously.\n\n\nBut for Wu You,\n\n\na little bit is better than nothing, and he couldn't get anything else.\n\n\nHe was very enthusiastic about cooperating with online variety shows.\n\n\nHis enthusiasm also touched the online variety show producers.\n\n\nIn an environment where everyone was giving him the cold shoulder, suddenly someone came forward with a warm attitude. It was such a heartwarming gesture!\n\n\nSo, more online variety show programs came knocking.\n\n\n...\n\n\nHalf a year later,\n\n\nthere was a sudden rumor in the industry: \"COLA7 appeared simultaneously on 5 online variety shows.\"\n\n\nOnline variety shows, with their more relaxed standards and more flexible program schedules, quickly gained popularity among viewers.\n\n\nCOLA7 became an overnight sensation,\n\n\nand Wu You also became famous in the industry for his \"keen eye,\" and his boldness in concentrating resources on online variety shows inspired many new talent managers.\n\n\n\"Little Wu, I didn't misjudge you after all.\"\n\n\nAt the celebration banquet, Zhang Wenshan, the president of Xingkong Culture, excitedly patted Wu You on the shoulder and said loudly.\n\n\n\"We need talent from all walks of life. Back then, I went against the tide to bring in excellent people from other fields into the ranks of talent managers. You didn't let me down!\"\n\n\nThus,\n\n\nhe was entrusted with an important task by his boss, leading the talent management team and taking charge of the company's original flagship group \"weetgirls (Sweetheart Girls).\"\n\n\nThis is a pop singing group.\n\n\nIt was also the company's flagship artist before COLA7.\n\n\nThere are only two members, Yang Tiantian and Zhou Xinyi.\n\n\nTheir early image was always imitating Hong Kong and Taiwan styles, and sweetgirls (Sweetheart Girls) was quite well-known in surrounding areas, but they had been stuck in a bottleneck for the past six months, showing no signs of improvement, and even showing signs of declining popularity.\n\n\nAs the online variety show big shot in everyone's eyes, Wu You carried the deep expectations of the company and the group members.\n\n\nThey hoped he could use the internet to take the group to greater heights.\n\n\nWu You was completely clueless.\n\n\nFaced with everyone's expectant gazes, he almost wanted to confess several times.\n\n\nFortunately, this time sweetgirls (Sweetheart Girls) had a certain level of popularity. Unlike COLA7, they had some commercial performance invitations.\n\n\nSo he aimed for no mistakes rather than achievements.\n\n\nWu You followed suit and began to handle performance announcements and other matters.\n\n\nSince the promotional effect of online variety shows had already been proven, online variety shows quickly became a fiercely competitive arena for big artists, just like television variety shows. Entering the market at this point offered no more benefits.\n\n\nA few months later, the group's popularity showed no improvement.\n\n\nIt even continued to decline.\n\n\nQuestions started to arise within the company.\n\n\n...\n\n\n\"Can Wu You do it this time?\"\n\n\n\"I think it's doubtful. Last time, I think it was just blind luck.\"\n\n\n...\n\n\nOne day after lunch, Wu You suddenly received an invitation email.\n\n\n《New Trend Weibo Celebrity Sign-Up Invitation》\n\n\nWu You touched his hair.\n\n\nHe usually liked to read news, and he had some impression of this New Trend Weibo.\n\n\nInspired by the global popularity of the overseas platform \"Tweet,\" major companies in China rushed into the Weibo battlefield.\n\n\nThe more powerful ones include Tencent's Penguin Weibo, NetEase's NetEase Weibo, and gaming company Happy Weibo...\n\n\nThis New Trend Weibo is a startup company, starting late and developing slowly.\n\n\nPenguin and NetEase's Weibo users have both exceeded 50 million, while New Trend has just exceeded 10 million. The user coverage rate is very low.\n\n\nAfter opening the invitation letter and looking at it, Wu You became interested in the content.\n\n\nIn order to attract celebrities to sign up, New Trend Weibo offered full-platform traffic exposure to the first 500 celebrities who signed up, and would also provide cash incentives to celebrity managers.\n\n\nThis is good!\n\n\nThere's a cash reward... oh no, there's also full-platform traffic exposure?\n\n\nWu You perked up, and quickly filled in the registration information on the webpage.\n\n\nLater, at the annual meeting, Wu You learned that this celebrity sign-up activity only attracted less than 150 celebrities in total.\n\n\nHowever, relying on these 150 celebrities,\n\n\nNew Trend Weibo successfully converted their fans into Weibo users, resulting in a surge in registrations.\n\n\nThanks to this operation, New Trend Weibo quickly secured a new round of financing, and then invited more celebrities who had been waiting and seeing.\n\n\nSoon, New Trend Weibo, relying on celebrity sign-ups, quickly became a top player and, within a few years, developed into the undisputed leader in the Weibo field.\n\n\nAnd the early sweetgirls, also by virtue of their early entry, received good traffic exposure support on Weibo.\n\n\nOnce again, Wu You became,\n\n\na top talent manager, his name echoing through Jiangzhou."
