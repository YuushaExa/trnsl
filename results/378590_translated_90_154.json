In her usual character, she would have reminded Shen Lingdong to wear long johns again, but today was a bit different. After a simple affirmation, she continued to look out the window.\n\nThrough the reflection on the car window, Shen Lingdong saw his mother quietly wiping away tears.\n\nShen Lingdong took a deep breath and continued to drive.\n\nAfter a long while, Shen Lingdong and Li Xianglan arrived at the prison. After completing the procedures, they went to the visitation room.\n\nA moment later, a prison guard brought Shen Chaonan over.\n\nAs soon as Shen Chaonan entered the visitation room and saw Shen Lingdong opposite him, his body trembled. His eyes turned red, and he stood there for a long time.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Shen Chaonan, who had a buzz cut and some silver threads appearing at his temples. He swallowed and said softly to Shen Chaonan, \"Dad, happy birthday.\"\n\nThe tears that had been welling up in Shen Chaonan's eyes finally spilled out. He came in front of Shen Lingdong and choked out, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Why are you apologizing to me?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Because of my situation, you couldn't become a police officer,\" Shen Chaonan said with his head bowed, the front of his clothes already wet with tears.\n\n\"I... I don't want to be a police officer anymore. I'm not worthy of the word 'police',\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Shen Chaonan said again.\n\n\"Are you apologizing to me? What about Qin Qin and her family? If you killed someone, you owe them the most apology. If you didn't kill them and let the real culprit get away with it, you still owe them an apology,\" Shen Lingdong said, clenching his fists tightly, and speaking to Shen Chaonan.\n\nLi Xianglan, standing beside them, tried to mediate, \"Let's talk about something else. Lingdong finally came to visit.\"\n\nShen Chaonan sat down on a chair and slowly began to speak to Shen Lingdong, \"Officer Xie came to see me yesterday.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly stunned and then asked, \"He came to see you? What did he say?\"\n\n\"He told me about your recent situation, said you're currently doing crime scene cleanup, but you've also provided great help in solving murder cases.\"\n\n\"He's not going to ask you to persuade me to stop getting involved in cases, is he?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\nShen Chaonan shook his head and then said, \"He thinks highly of you, but I think it's fine for you to work as a cleaner at crime scenes. However, I hope you just do the cleaning.\"\n\n\"Now I've found some clues. I will definitely find out the truth. I... I will bring you out of here,\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\nThe prison guard beside them glanced at Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Chaonan then said, \"You'll harm yourself if you do this.\"\n\nShen Lingdong became a bit agitated at this point and shouted at Shen Chaonan, \"Are you still not going to tell me about that case?\"\n\nShen Chaonan shook his head helplessly, \"There's nothing to say.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed silently and then said, \"Then there's nothing for me to say either. I just want to do what I want to do.\"\n\nShen Chaonan looked at Shen Lingdong for a long time in silence, then slowly opened his mouth and said, \"I've let you and your mother down. Because of my affairs, you two have suffered for so many years. Most of our relatives have cut ties with us. However, I heard from Officer Xie that your cleaning company's business is doing much better now. If you have a chance, reconnect with them.\"\n\nAt this moment, Li Xianglan quickly interjected, \"Yesterday, my second sister called me. She said she saw our Lingdong online.\"\n\nShen Chaonan nodded and said, \"If there's a chance, connect with all of them.\"\n\nAt this time, the prison guard urged from the side, \"Time is almost up.\"\n\nShen Chaonan looked at Shen Lingdong and then said, \"I'm really happy to see you come today.\"\n\nWith that, he slowly stood up and was led out of the room by the prison guard. Shen Lingdong patted his mother's shoulder and then said, \"Let's go too.\"\n\nLi Xianglan nodded.\n\nShen Chaonan left the interrogation room, looked back, and sighed silently, shaking his head as he left.\n\nAt this moment, the prison guard took Shen Chaonan directly to the mess hall.\n\nAs Shen Chaonan was getting his food, the prison guard responsible for serving meals looked at Shen Chaonan and then took a piece of cake from the side and placed it on his tray.\n\n...\n\nShen Lingdong got back into the car and turned to look at Li Xianglan. He said, \"Mom, I will definitely get Dad out.\"\n\n\"Sigh...\" Li Xianglan sighed softly and said, \"You think Dad was wrongly accused, so why was he so foolish to admit that he killed someone?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head slightly and said, \"This is precisely where his cleverness lies. I wasn't sure if he really killed someone before, but now I'm very sure.\"\n\n\"How did you see that?\" Li Xianglan asked back.\n\n\"Intuition.\"\n\nWith that, Shen Lingdong started the car and returned to the company.\n\nAt nine o'clock, Shen Lingdong appeared at the company.\n\nThere was no work at the company today, and it was raining, so everyone was sitting downstairs chatting.\n\nWang Jizhong saw Shen Lingdong and immediately asked, \"Why do you look so relaxed today?\"\n\n\"Do I?\" Shen Lingdong asked back.\n\nWang Jizhong turned to Li Xianglan and asked, \"Sister Li, what's wrong with Shen Lingdong?\"\n\n\"It's nothing. We went to the prison today,\" Li Xianglan said softly.\n\nWang Jizhong suddenly understood and quickly turned to Shen Lingdong, \"Have you let go of your worries?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head and said, \"I've just thought some things through. I've decided to investigate my father's case to the end.\"\n\nWang Jizhong straightened up instantly, grabbed his jacket, and said, \"Alright, where should we start our investigation?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked outside, where it was still raining, and then said, \"Let's call it a day. Everyone rest today.\"\n\nWang Jizhong stood up and stretched his body, muttering to himself, \"Ah, it's so annoying when it rains. My whole body aches when it rains.\"\n\n\"You're old.\"\n\n\"It's mainly the boredom that's uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"If you don't want to be idle, let's have a big clean-up.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Wang Jizhong immediately agreed.\n\nAt this moment, Old Zheng leaned back in his chair and said, \"It's raining outside, isn't it better to chat for a while?\"\n\nXu Tao and Yuan Yuan also agreed with Old Zheng's sentiment.\n\nAt this time, Shen Lingdong smiled slightly and then said, \"I was just kidding. Since everyone is here, how about we have hot pot for lunch?\"\n\n\"Sounds good. And some drinks?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then nodded. He then looked at everyone and said, \"Let's go buy ingredients. Xu Tao, Yuan Yuan, the three of us will go buy meat.\"",

    "content": "**Chapter 88: Villa Homicide**\n\nOctober 18, 2021, Criminal Investigation Team.\n\nThe week-long rain finally stopped, and the sky cleared.\n\nLin Xiangbei rummaged through a cabinet, found a tin of good tea, hummed a little tune, took a pinch of tea leaves from the tin and put them into a thermos, then poured in some hot water.\n\nAt this moment, Director Sun pushed open the door to Lin Xiangbei's office. Seeing the tea tin on Lin Xiangbei's desk, he smiled and said, \"Captain Lin seems to be in a good mood today, even drinking tea?\"\n\n\"Director Sun, would you like some?\"\n\nDirector Sun walked to the desk, picked up the tea tin, and took a good look at it. Then he said, \"You don't usually drink it anyway, so I'll take this can?\"\n\n\"Hey! Director Sun, leave me some?\"\n\nJust then, Zhao Xiaofei suddenly appeared at the doorway, panting. Seeing Director Sun in the office, he quickly greeted them, \"Director Sun, Captain Lin...\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned and immediately asked, \"What happened?\"\n\n\"There's been a homicide at Yuhai Villa.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei's expression immediately tensed. He quickly grabbed his jacket and said, \"Call everyone immediately, let's go take a look.\"\n\n\"It might be a bit difficult...\" Zhao Xiaofei looked troubled.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Lin Xiangbei asked back.\n\n\"The only road leading to Yuhai Villa is blocked due to a landslide from the recent rain. Our vehicles might not be able to get through.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, put on his jacket, and then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Let's go take a look first.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain Lin.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei quickly gathered the other team members and headed towards Yuhai Villa.\n\nAfter getting into the car, Lin Xiangbei asked Zhao Xiaofei, \"What's the situation?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei immediately said, \"The informant is the agency company. The owner of Yulong Villa has been in another province, so the villa is open for rent to create value and avoid being vacant. The daily fee is three thousand. A week ago, someone rented it from the agency for three days. After three days, the agency couldn't contact that person. It wasn't until this morning. However, the agency came to Yuhai Villa via a small path and found a body in the villa's hall. Moreover, all the doors and windows of the villa were locked.\"\n\n\"Investigate the information of the person who rented the villa and the agency immediately,\" Lin Xiangbei said quickly.\n\n\"Okay, boss, I'll arrange it right away.\"\n\nSoon, the group arrived at the landslide site. Huge rocks blocked the way, and the road was covered in mud, making it impossible to proceed.\n\nOn a small path nearby, a set of footprints could be seen.\n\nZhao Xiaofei said to Lin Xiangbei, \"This should be the small path the agency mentioned.\"\n\n\"Collect evidence first, then everyone get out of the car and walk over,\" Lin Xiangbei instructed after observing the ground.\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, several police officers walked over and began taking pictures of the footprints.\n\nThe group began walking along the small path towards Yuhai Villa. Although it was passable, the journey was difficult. Along the way, the traces of the agency's fall could also be seen.\n\n\"Everyone be careful,\" Lin Xiangbei, who was walking at the front, reminded everyone.\n\nThe ten-minute journey took about half an hour. Everyone was covered in mud to some extent.\n\nYuhai Villa was just ahead, and it could already be seen.\n\nGu Du\n\nNot far away, a man covered in mud appeared in their sight. He was sitting dejectedly on a rock by the roadside.\n\nSeeing Lin Xiangbei and his team, the man stood up and said, \"Police notification, you're finally here?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei looked him over and asked, \"What's the situation inside?\"\n\n\"I am Mr. Wu Anguo's agent. I've always been responsible for helping him rent out the villa. A week ago, a person named Song Ming called me and booked it for three days, paying a deposit of two thousand yuan. But after three days, when I called him to collect the remaining payment, his phone was unreachable. Because it had been raining for the past few days, I decided to come and check today after the rain stopped. But I saw a corpse lying in the center of the living room.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" Lin Xiangbei asked casually.\n\n\"Zhao Bo.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei then walked towards Yuhai Villa. The villa was about the size of a football field, with a building area of over a thousand square meters, three stories high, and a brick-stone structure.\n\n\"Search the yard first,\" Lin Xiangbei instructed his team members.\n\nAfterward, Lin Xiangbei arrived at the villa's entrance. He put on his gloves and tried to push the door, finding it locked.\n\nLin Xiangbei turned to Zhao Bo and asked, \"Do you have the key?\"\n\n\"Wu Anguo left two keys with me. I gave one to Song Ming, and I still have one.\"\n\n\"Open it.\"\n\nZhao Bo felt his pockets, then took out a key and handed it to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nAfter Lin Xiangbei opened the door, he stood at the entrance and looked inside, then looked upstairs. He then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Go in and take a look.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei responded and led his men inside.\n\nLin Xiangbei, meanwhile, circled the villa. The outside windows had iron bars, which were very sturdy and difficult to break, so the only entrance to the entire villa was the main door.\n\nAfter a full circle, he returned to the entrance.\n\nZhao Xiaofei also appeared in a hurry. \"Boss, there's another body in the kitchen, two in the guest rooms on the second floor, two in the guest rooms on the third floor, one in the study, plus the one in the hall. That makes a total of seven bodies.\"\n\n\"Seven?\" Lin Xiangbei was stunned. His expression immediately became grave, and he entered the room to investigate.\n\nAfter checking all the places where bodies were found, Lin Xiangbei's brow furrowed. Apart from the body in the hall, all the other bodies were found in their respective rooms. From the outside, it was impossible to see any problems.\n\nAfter a thorough check, Lin Xiangbei said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Have Sister Xi come over to conduct autopsies, and quickly verify the identities of these individuals.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain. Hey? Captain, isn't this like the 'And Then There Were None' scenario from detective novels?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei also frowned and nodded. \"I didn't expect such a major homicide case to happen in this day and age.\"\n\n\"Should we call Shen Lingdong over?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated slightly, then said, \"Oh, Shen Lingdong. Let's wait a bit longer.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei looked at the villa's courtyard and then asked Zhao Bo, \"Is this the only road here?\"\n\nZhao Bo nodded. \"There's only one road. Usually, company team-building events come here. Otherwise, living here alone would be quite frightening.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei then slowly asked, \"Do cars come here?\"\n\n\"No, people usually drive themselves here.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned and looked at the courtyard, where there were no cars. He then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Check all the taxis in the city and inquire if any taxis came here seven days ago.\"",

    "content": "Special Site Cleanup Team\n\nNovember 3, 2021.\n\nHalf a month had passed since the murder case at YuHai Villa.\n\nDuring this time, Shen Lingdong had handled a cleanup task at a car accident scene. The rest of his time was free, although he had received many orders for ordinary cleaning jobs.\n\nIn these past two weeks, Shen Lingdong had only seen Gu Caiwei once. Everyone was busy, making it seem like Shen Lingdong was the only idle person.\n\nThere had been no progress on the case involving his father. It was as if the clues about \"The Director\" had vanished along with the conclusion of the previous murder case. Fortunately, \"The Director\" had been quiet lately and hadn't taken any further action.\n\nOne day, as Shen Lingdong arrived at the company, he saw Zhao Xiaofei standing at the entrance.\n\nUpon seeing Shen Lingdong's car, Zhao Xiaofei hurried over and blocked Shen Lingdong, who was about to get out.\n\nWang Jizhong and the others, carrying their tools, also got into the car.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, his expression grave. \"Another murder case?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei walked around the front of the car, opened the passenger door, hesitated for a moment, then opened the rear door and got in.\n\n\"YuHai Villa. I'll tell you as you drive.\"\n\nShen Lingdong opened his phone, navigated to YuHai Villa, and then started the car. The location was quite remote, and he had never heard of it before.\n\nZhao Xiaofei leaned his head near Shen Lingdong's and said, \"On October 18th, a major criminal case was discovered at YuHai Villa. A total of seven people were killed.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned. \"Oh, I remember it rained continuously for a week around that time.\"\n\n\"Yes, it had just cleared up that day. The person who reported it was Zhao Bo, an agent from the company responsible for renting out YuHai Villa. He had rented it to a young man named Song Ming on October 11th for three days. The purpose was unknown, but that night, the rain caused a landslide, blocking the road to YuHai Villa. It wasn't until the 18th, when the weather cleared, that Zhao Bo took a small path to check on the villa and found Song Ming's body inside.\"\n\n\"Didn't you say there were seven bodies?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Song Ming's body was in the lobby on the first floor. The other six bodies were on the second and third floors. I'll give you more details when we get to the scene.\"\n\n\"It's been half a month already,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\nZhao Xiaofei sighed quietly. \"It was a classic 'Snowstorm Villa' scenario. The doors and windows of the villa were locked, with no signs of forced entry. Due to the mudslide, the nearby signal towers were also damaged. For those seven days, it was truly an isolated island...\"\n\nAt this point, Wang Jizhong chimed in, \"This is my first time encountering something like this.\"\n\n\"Wasn't there a small path?\" Shen Lingdong continued to ask.\n\n\"Indeed, but the doors and windows were all locked from the inside, making it impossible to get in or out. We've only identified the identities of a few victims so far, with no other progress. The higher-ups are taking this case very seriously. Under normal circumstances, a murder case like this wouldn't be unsealed so quickly. Captain Lin is under a lot of pressure to get it unsealed ahead of time.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly. \"We'll discuss it more when we get there.\"\n\nOld Zheng, who was sitting nearby, sighed. \"The name of this villa is unlucky. YuHai Villa, isn't that 'meeting death'?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the rearview mirror and said to Zheng Daoguang, \"Don't forget, you still need to handle matters with the victims' families. There are seven victims this time.\"\n\n\"Yes, Section Chief Shen. I'll arrange it tomorrow,\" Zheng Daoguang replied.\n\nAn hour later, Shen Lingdong and his team arrived at YuHai Villa.\n\nShen Lingdong and the others changed into protective suits, put on gas masks, and Shen Lingdong casually handed Zhao Xiaofei a set. Then, they walked into the villa.\n\nAs soon as they entered the lobby, they saw a large pool of blood in the center, with splatter marks. After so much time, the blood had turned a dark red. Shen Lingdong looked up.\n\nThe interior of the villa was spiral in structure, allowing a view of each floor from the lobby.\n\nZhao Xiaofei took out a notebook and began reading, \"The deceased at this location is Song Ming, 25 years old, a local from Dongjiang City, residing in TianXi Garden. According to the forensic examination, the time of death was early morning on the 12th. He was the last to die among these individuals. The time of death for the others was between the night of the 11th and the early morning of the 12th. Due to the similar times of death, it is currently impossible to determine the sequence of their deaths.\"\n\nAs Zhao Xiaofei spoke, Wang Jizhong took notes.\n\n\"Who is the second victim?\"\n\n\"The second victim is Lu Fei, 27 years old, a local from Dongjiang City, residing in XiangYang Residential Area. He worked as a programmer. He was found in the kitchen, and the cause of death was burning. However, we didn't find any signs of fire in the kitchen, so that was likely not where he was killed.\"\n\nShen Lingdong went to inspect the kitchen and then walked upstairs, asking as he went, \"The remaining victims are upstairs, right?\"\n\n\"The third victim is Qiu Gao, residing in room 201. The cause of death was a sharp object piercing his chest, leading to excessive blood loss. The fourth victim is Qi Shuang, the only female among the seven victims. She died from a blunt force trauma to the back of the head.\"\n\n\"The fifth victim is Gao Qing, 32 years old, the oldest among all the victims. He resided in room 301. The cause of death was suffocation, with no external wounds.\"\n\n\"The sixth victim is Jing Liang, 28 years old, residing in room 302. He died from cyanide poisoning. Although there were no external wounds, there were significant amounts of vomit in the room. However, no toxic substances were found in the vomit.\"\n\n\"The seventh victim is Cao JiaZhi. He resided in room 303, but the location of his death was actually in the study. The cause of death was multiple stab wounds to the abdomen, leading to excessive blood loss.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei closed his notebook and continued, \"I will be with you until you finish your cleanup. You can ask me any questions.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then took a rag from the toolbox and threw it to Zhao Xiaofei. \"Then you shouldn't be idle either.\"\n\n\"Starting work already?\" Zheng Daoguang asked in surprise. He then walked over to the light switch and tried to turn on the lights, but after several attempts, the lobby lights remained unresponsive.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei quickly interjected, \"The electrical box was damaged. It hasn't been repaired yet.\"\n\nZheng Daoguang immediately said, \"Without electricity, our equipment won't work!\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly replied, \"Xu Tao is on his way. I asked him to bring a backup power supply.\"\n\nZheng Daoguang frowned. \"When did you notify him? I didn't see.\"\n\n\"Just now.\" Shen Lingdong took out his phone, sent a WeChat message to Xu Tao, and then continued, \"He should be here in about an hour. Let's search the rooms first and see if there are any other clues. Remember! Make sure the recording equipment is turned on.\"\n\nAfter walking around the villa, Shen Lingdong came to the entrance of the villa, clutching his chest, and stepped outside for some fresh air.\n\nWang Jizhong also followed him out, taking off his gas mask. He patted his pockets and realized his cigarette pack was in an inner pocket. The protective suit he was wearing had no pockets. After struggling for a while, he managed to retrieve the cigarette pack, lit one, and then asked Shen Lingdong softly, \"What's wrong? Can't take it?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head slightly. \"It's not my body that can't take it, it's my mind. The killer was too brutal. What kind of person would kill seven people in a single night?\"\n\nWang Jizhong, with a blank expression, drew on his cigarette and exhaled a smoke ring. He said slowly, \"There are all kinds of people.\"\n\n\"I've seen people who kill their wives and then act as if nothing happened... Sometimes, it's hard to fathom the killer's thoughts. Sometimes, what we consider their motive for killing seems childish, but the deed is done. All we can do is clean this place up and bring justice to the room, to the victims.\"\n\n\"I've checked all the corners and ceilings of the villa and didn't find any table salt. Could this case be unrelated to that director?\"\n\n\"How can every case be related to him? Is this Dongjiang City their private property?\" Wang Jizhong shook his head helplessly, then asked, \"Do you have any thoughts now?\"\n\n\"We can try to reconstruct what they were doing before they were killed. Perhaps we can find some clues.\"\n\nWang Jizhong snorted. \"Unfortunately, the surveillance cameras are broken.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed. \"I'm used to it. However, if we can determine their habits and the traces of items at the scene, we can roughly deduce their actions beforehand.\"\n\nWang Jizhong's pupils contracted, and he looked at Shen Lingdong with shock. \"You can reconstruct it?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked equally confused. \"The head of the Forensic Trace Evidence department can't reconstruct it?\"\n\n\"They can... when they're young... now that I'm old...\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled. \"Age is a good excuse.\"\n\n\"Did you investigate me?\"\n\n\"I guessed,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei also came over to Shen Lingdong and asked in a low voice, \"Did you find anything?\"\n\n\"Jing Liang... died of cyanide poisoning. Vomit was found at the scene, but no toxic substances were detected in the vomit. I examined the residual vomit. Additionally, in Qiu Gao's room, a large number of beer cans were found, indicating that the two of them had been drinking. Jing Liang's death likely occurred after drinking. We can use this as a reference point to determine the sequence of deaths of the others.\"\n\nWang Jizhong looked doubtful. \"If the others had no interaction with these two, how can we use the timing as a reference?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then took Wang Jizhong's hand. \"There's a task that requires our most experienced colleague, Brother Wang, to complete.\"\n\n\"Alright, don't flatter me. It's definitely not good news.\"\n\n\"Based on the undigested food found in the vomit, we can determine how many dishes they ate. There were one to two more dishes on the table than the number of people, preferably an even number.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei hesitated slightly, then said, \"I know this. There were a total of three people. Sister Xi dissected three bodies. Undigested food similar to this was found in the stomachs of Qiu Gao, Jing Liang, and Qi Shuang.\"\n\nShen Lingdong's eyebrows slightly rose. \"Since the police have already investigated this, we can save time.\"\n\nWang Jizhong asked, \"Then how do we determine the order of their deaths?\"\n\n\"All the ingredients were in the kitchen. To cook, one must operate in the kitchen. However, Lu Fei died in the kitchen, so his death occurred after Qiu, Jing, and Qi were drinking. But there's one point: Cao JiaZhi died in the study on the third floor. Based on the blood splatter, he was reading a book, and there was blood spatter on the book in front of him.\"\n\n\"However, the villa lost power. Naturally, one cannot read at night, so Cao JiaZhi was killed during the day. In Qiu Gao's room, there were traces of burnt candles, indicating they were drinking at night. Therefore, Cao JiaZhi was killed before they started drinking.\"\n\n\"One point worth noting is that among these individuals, Qiu Gao and Cao JiaZhi died in the same manner. The others died in different ways: burning, poisoning, suffocation. I feel the killer prepared a different method of death for each person. However, during this process, one method of killing was disrupted. As a last resort, the killer used a knife to kill Qiu Gao again, so I think Qiu Gao's death might have occurred later.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei then asked, \"But we can be sure that Song Ming was the last to die. If the killer had no other method, they could have first pushed Qiu Gao to his death, and then killed Song Ming.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"The 'Snowstorm Villa' trope has been overused by novelists. Yuan Yuan is currently writing a novel about a 'Snowstorm Villa,' a very cliché story. Novelists have explored every possibility. We need to consider two scenarios: The first is that there was someone else in the villa at the time, who could have escaped through a secret passage after committing the murders. The second scenario is that the killer is among the deceased.\"\n\n\"Based on the scene at the entrance, the person who could kill everyone and then commit suicide is, in my estimation, Jing Liang's poisoning death and Song Ming's apparent fall to his death.\"\n\n\"However, I did not find Song Ming's footprints around the railings on the second and third floors. Unless he was thrown down, or the killer cleaned up the footprints.\"\n\n\"So, there was someone else at the scene,\" Zhao Xiaofei said, slightly stunned, then sighed. \"Even if the killer left traces outside, they would have been washed away by the rain during those days.\"\n\nShen Lingdong slowly said, \"Give me a detailed profile of each person, including their living habits. If I can see their rooms at their homes, perhaps I can discover what they were doing in this villa?\"",

    "content": "，Special Scene Cleanup Team\n\nZhao Xiaofei quickly asked his colleagues to send over their information.\n\nShen Lingdong gathered everyone and explained the cleaning process for this mission.\n\nThe area to be cleaned this time was quite large. The first floor was nearly a thousand square meters, and while the second and third floors weren't as extensive, they combined for over a thousand square meters. Although there were only seven contaminated locations, even areas without contamination needed to be cleaned and disinfected because they were related to a homicide. Therefore, Shen Lingdong initially planned to complete the cleaning work in three days.\n\nThey would clean from top to bottom, in order.\n\nHowever, before starting the cleanup, they needed to thoroughly investigate everyone's background. Once the cleaning began, it would mean that all evidence within Jade Mountain Villa would be erased.\n\nWhile waiting, Shen Lingdong surveyed the villa again. This time, the investigation was not focused on the homicide itself but was more inclined towards their daily lives.\n\nIn a trash can near the lobby, they found snack bags. Some snack residue was also visible on the sofa, and one of the snack bags still contained half a bag of snacks.\n\n\"Rummaging through trash cans again?\" Wang Jizhong said, watching Shen Lingdong squatting beside a trash can, lost in thought.\n\n\"There are a total of six snack bags, and one of them still has half a bag left. If I'm not mistaken, they were sitting here, chatting and eating snacks,\" Shen Lingdong said, examining the remaining half bag of snacks and using the residue on the sofa and floor to determine their positions at the time.\n\nWang Jizhong also walked over and joined Shen Lingdong.\n\nA moment later, Shen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong placed the snack bags on the two sofas respectively.\n\nThis sofa set consisted of two semicircles with a circular one placed in the middle.\n\n\"This...\" Wang Jizhong stroked his stubble, staring blankly at the snack bags.\n\nShen Lingdong was also staring at the snack bags, lost in thought. After a moment of contemplation, he said to Wang Jizhong, \"This was what they ate during their first group meeting shortly after arriving at the villa. The remaining half bag should belong to the girl. They probably didn't know each other well.\"\n\nWang Jizhong looked thoughtful.\n\nZheng Daoguang, not far away, watched the two of them and then asked, \"Did you deduce this? It feels like you're just guessing.\"\n\nWang Jizhong chimed in, \"If several people who don't know each other sit together and don't maintain a certain distance, wouldn't it be a bit awkward?\"\n\nJust then, Zhao Xiaofei ran over, holding his phone, and called out to Shen Lingdong, \"The information has been sent!\"\n\nHe hurried to Shen Lingdong and handed him the phone.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly took the phone, glanced through it, forwarded the information to his own phone, and then said, \"They know each other through the internet. Although they contacted each other frequently online, they had never met in person.\"\n\nWang Jizhong frowned and then said, \"Qi Shuang is a girl. Didn't she know the others were all guys? Wasn't she worried?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then added, \"She knew Qiu Gao, but they weren't a couple.\"\n\n\"Who organized everyone to come here?\" Wang Jizhong asked.\n\n\"Song Ming. He's a rich second-generation heir. The expenses at this villa are not something ordinary people can afford.\"\n\n\"How did they get here?\"\n\n\"By taxi. Based on the payment records on their phones found by the police, we can also roughly determine the order in which they arrived here. Cao Jiazhi, Lu Fei, Gao Qing, Qiu Gao, and Qi Shuang arrived together, followed by Jing Liang. Song Ming was the last to arrive. However, the time difference wasn't significant, with most arriving between 9 and 10 o'clock.\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded, then frowned and began to ponder.\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"Since they didn't know each other very well, they had to introduce themselves. It was during that time that they ate those snacks. However, it only indicates that one person didn't eat; we can't determine who that person is yet.\"\n\nAt this point, Shen Lingdong went over to the sofa and looked at the table lamp on the coffee table. Beneath the lamp, there was a clean circular area. The circular mark perfectly matched the lamp's base, but its position was slightly shifted.\n\nFurthermore, some decorative items on the lamp were missing.\n\nShen Lingdong searched the surroundings and found the ornament behind the sofa.\n\n\"It seems their conversation wasn't very pleasant.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stared at the ornament, and images of several people appeared in his mind.\n\n【At Song Ming's urging, everyone came out of their rooms and gathered in the first-floor lobby. At that moment, they discovered a vending machine near the kitchen. Song Ming took a bag of snacks for each person, but he only took six bags.】\n\n【They then took their seats.】\n\n【Qi Shuang sat at the leftmost seat on the left sofa, with Qiu Gao sitting next to her. Possibly Jing Liang sat next to Qiu Gao, while Song Ming sat on the right sofa, with two other people sitting beside Song Ming, likely Lu Fei and Gao Qing.】\n\n【They ate snacks and got to know each other.】\n\n【Initially, the atmosphere was very harmonious, but as time went on, disagreements began to emerge.】\n\nAt this point, the scene in Shen Lingdong's mind paused, and he fell into thought.\n\nIf there was a dispute among them, it was most likely between Qiu Gao and Qi Shuang. For instance, if Qi Shuang mentioned during introductions that she was single, and Qiu Gao might have been in an ambiguous stage with her, hearing such a statement could make him uncomfortable, causing him to leave in a huff and express his frustration by knocking over the nearby table lamp.\n\nThe second possibility is that someone flirted with Qi Shuang, such as Song Ming, and Qiu Gao argued with Song Ming to protect Qi Shuang.\n\nThe third possibility, for which there was no evidence yet, was that they divided into two groups, possibly arranged in two rows according to their seating, and then a dispute occurred.\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong slowly spoke up, \"From a psychological perspective, the person sitting in the middle will unconsciously take on a leading role. To manage the emotions of the two people beside them, they will chat with each person separately, gradually controlling the conversation and thus dominating the conversation.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback and looked at Wang Jizhong in surprise.\n\nWhat Wang Jizhong said precisely addressed Shen Lingdong's doubts, which were precisely what Shen Lingdong had been thinking.\n\n\"How did you know what I was thinking?\"\n\n\"Your eyes gave you away. It felt like you were reconstructing the scene.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was amazed. This was likely Wang Jizhong's true capability – not only reconstructing the scene but also inferring his inner thoughts. He then asked, \"How did you do that?\"\n\n\"Practice makes perfect.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued reconstructing the scene.\n\n【Because of the dispute, Qiu Gao stood up and left, casually knocking over the table lamp and returning upstairs. By then, everyone had finished their snacks. The only girl, Qi Shuang, still had half a bag left. Seeing Qiu Gao leave, she put down the half bag of snacks she was holding and followed him.】\n\n【In the blink of an eye, it was time for lunch.】\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong arrived at the dining room. On the dining table, there were three self-heating hot pots. However, in the trash can nearby, there were seven boxes. Moreover, a significant amount of unused ingredients was found in the trash can.\n\n【Qi Shuang, wanting to mend fences, placed the prepared self-heating meals on the dining table and called everyone to eat. Although seven portions were prepared, only six of them showed up; one person still hadn't come downstairs.】\n\n【After they had lunch, they became curious as to why that person hadn't come downstairs. Subsequently, the group went to the third floor to search. After a period of searching, they found Cao Jiazhi, who was already dead, in the study.】\n\n【Everyone was startled and immediately panicked.】\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong snapped back to reality and asked Wang Jizhong, \"Guess where I reconstructed the scene up to?\"\n\nWang Jizhong hesitated slightly and said, \"The group had a disagreement, and Qiu Gao, Qi Shuang, and Jing Liang didn't eat dinner with them, and instead went to Jing Liang's room to drink?\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback and then said, \"I have a question. Under normal circumstances, if one discovers a homicide, a normal person's first reaction would be to call the police or escape. Even if the doors and windows were locked, the main door is a weak point, and the tools inside the room could be used to force it open. However, they did not do so.\n\nFurthermore, knowing that a homicide was likely to occur, why would the three of them still be drinking together? Getting themselves drunk would only give the killer more opportunities to act.\n\nThis is where I can't figure it out.\"\n\n\"Ah... this part. Didn't your teacher ever teach you to skip questions you can't answer?\" Wang Jizhong scratched his head and said to Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"Do I need to skip questions that were only high school level?\"\n\n\"Oh, oh, oh, stop bragging. If it were easy, why didn't you get into Tsinghua or Peking University?\" Wang Jizhong said dismissively.\n\n\"At that time, I only wanted to be a police officer,\" Shen Lingdong said expressionlessly.\n\n\"At that time... you don't want to be a police officer now?\" Wang Jizhong retorted.\n\n\"No. Do you think I'm still fit to be a police officer?\" Shen Lingdong countered. After a brief pause, he continued, \"Besides, I think my current job is quite good.\"\n\nWang Jizhong frowned as he looked at Shen Lingdong, pondered for a moment, and then said to Shen Lingdong, \"If you can prove your father's innocence, I think you could be a very good detective. If you believe you are not fit to be a police officer, after much thought, there's only one possibility: you want to do something bad.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and then said, \"Having navigated society for so many years, although I've always remembered the rules of being a police officer, I sometimes find myself considering matters from a perspective of self-interest.\"\n\nHearing Shen Lingdong say this, Wang Jizhong breathed a sigh of relief and said, \"That's true. Last time, you didn't hand over the evidence to the police immediately to get your reward. However, it's nothing serious; you can still be a good police officer.\"\n\nAt this moment, Zheng Daoguang leaned in and said to Shen Lingdong, \"If you don't want to be a police officer, that's easy. Have you considered Feng Shui and mystical arts? I've been thinking about taking on disciples recently...\"\n\n\"Great Immortal Zheng, no idle chat. Xiao Shen and I are analyzing the case right now.\"\n\n\"You were the one who started the idle chat. I have the evidence right here. Check the recording device on my chest if you don't believe me.\"\n\nShen Lingdong suddenly remembered something and quickly said, \"Right, no more idle chat. We need to submit this video to the police.\"\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong's lips curved slightly, and he asked Shen Lingdong, \"Xiao Shen, do you like Gu Caiwei or Yuan Yuan?\"\n\n\"Go, go, go, you're doing that on purpose. Let's analyze the case instead...\"\n\nWang Jizhong adjusted his mindset, put away his smile, glanced upstairs, and said, \"It seems Cao Jiazhi was the first victim. Shall we go to the study first?\"\n\n\"Let's go.\" Shen Lingdong agreed and then headed upstairs, calling Zhao Xiaofei along with him.\n\nThe study was located on the northwest side of the third floor, while the guest rooms were on the south side. If one came out of the guest rooms, they wouldn't pass by the study.\n\nThe study was also quite large, about ten meters long and five meters wide. The bookshelves along the walls were filled with various books. In the center, there was a desk, and inside that, there was a bar area. Next to it was a vending machine stocked with drinks, coffee, tea, and more.\n\nIn the middle of the desk, a chair was stained with blood, with splatters even reaching the books on the side and the table.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei slowly spoke up, as if afraid Shen Lingdong and the others wouldn't know the victim's information, and repeated it, \"The deceased, Cao Jiazhi, was stabbed multiple times in the abdomen and died from excessive blood loss. He lived in room 303.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the books on the table and then said, \"High school physics? Is he a teacher?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei quickly replied, \"Cao Jiazhi was a homeroom teacher at Mingde High School in Dongjiang City.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the notebook beside him and then slowly said, \"It looks like he was preparing a lesson. A very diligent teacher.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei nodded and then said, \"We visited their school. He was a dedicated and responsible teacher. His students spoke highly of him, and he often conducted interesting physics experiments with them. However, on September 10th, he was reported?\"\n\n\"For taking money?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\nZhao Xiaofei sighed softly and said, \"He didn't take money. The reason for the report was corporal punishment of students. After our investigation with the Education Bureau, we found no evidence of him administering corporal punishment.\"\n\n\"Who was the reporter?\"\n\n\"A student's parent making an unreasonable complaint,\" Zhao Xiaofei said.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, \"So... is his murder related to his profession?\"\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong asked Zhao Xiaofei, \"What's the school's atmosphere like?\"\n\n\"It's average, but there are instances of teachers accepting gifts.\"\n\n\"Could it be jealousy from colleagues?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and said, \"It's not certain, but the killer likely knew about this.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei immediately said, \"This incident didn't cause much public outcry.\"\n\n\"If it's related to this, then the killer must have planned to murder Cao Jiazhi for a long time since September. Moreover, multiple stab wounds suggest an act of venting anger...\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded and then said, \"And they were desperate to kill him. Cao Jiazhi was the first to arrive at the villa, at 9 o'clock. Assuming they started lunch at 12 o'clock, that's a total of three to four hours. They acted impatiently.\"",

    "content": "Shen Lingdong walked out of the study and stood at the doorway, checking the location of the guest rooms.\n\nFrom the study, one could reach the guest rooms on the opposite side by going left or right.\n\nThe closest room to the study was room 305. Of all the guest rooms on the third floor, only that one was unoccupied. However, if the occupants of rooms 302 and 303 wanted to go to the study, they would have to pass by rooms 301 or 304, which might alert the occupants of those rooms.\n\nOn the second floor, only rooms 201, 202, and 203 were occupied. If the guest in room 202 wanted to go to the third floor, they might also be noticed by the guests in rooms 201 and 203.\n\nTherefore, the only guests who could reach the study undetected to commit the murder were those in rooms 201, 203, 301, and 304, namely Qiu Gao, Lu Fei, Gao Qing, and Song Ming.\n\nOf course, this was assuming there was no eighth person in the villa. Moreover, after an initial inspection, Shen Lingdong had not found any secret rooms or passages within the villa, so he naturally dismissed such possibilities.\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong also came out of the study and asked Shen Lingdong, \"How is it?\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and shook his head slightly, saying, \"I think the killer is among Qiu Gao, Lu Fei, Gao Qing, and Song Ming.\"\n\nWang Jizhong hesitated for a moment and then said, \"If these seven people split into two small groups due to disagreements, I estimate they would divide by floor. And there would be another small group, Qiu Gao and Qi Shuang, as they already know each other.\"\n\nShen Lingdong pondered for a moment after hearing Wang Jizhong's words and nodded, saying, \"If the two of them collaborated, even if Qi Shuang passed by Qiu Gao's door, Qiu Gao might pretend not to notice, or they might even collude in the murder. Moreover, judging from the victim's condition, the victim was not on guard against the perpetrator. In this case, the guard against females would be even lower, making it easier to approach the victim. Old Wang, that's what you mean, right?\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded.\n\n\"But based on the information on these individuals, there seems to be no motive.\"\n\n\"Just their unusual behavior of not leaving the scene after the murder indicates that this is not a normal case, and we cannot solve it using normal case-solving methods. My point is, they might not need a motive at all.\"\n\nShen Lingdong's brow furrowed, his face full of confusion, and he looked at Wang Jizhong. \"Can we first determine the exact time of Cao Jiazhi's death, whether it was before or after their first gathering downstairs... The first period is from when the first person, Cao Jiazhi, arrived at the villa, until their first gathering downstairs. The second period is before lunch.\"\n\n\"Can we analyze that?\" Wang Jizhong asked with some uncertainty. He couldn't analyze it at all with his own abilities and could only hope Shen Lingdong had some trick up his sleeve.\n\nShen Lingdong's expression was solemn, and he fell into deep thought.\n\nJust then, the sound of a car suddenly came from downstairs. A moment later, Xu Tao arrived downstairs dragging a backup power source.\n\n\"I'm here,\" Xu Tao shouted loudly from downstairs. His voice echoed through the empty villa.\n\n\"We're upstairs,\" Zheng Daoguang came to the railing and shouted down.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Wang Jizhong and then said, \"Let's go down and get the supplies. Let's clean up the study first.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei quickly stepped forward and asked, \"Planning to clean up so soon? Shouldn't we investigate further?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Zhao Xiaofei in confusion. \"Isn't cleaning our main job?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei pondered for a moment and nodded, saying, \"Let's clean up. We've pretty much finished our search anyway.\"\n\n\"Then help me move some things up?\" Shen Lingdong smiled at Zhao Xiaofei.\n\nZhao Xiaofei: \"You really see me as free labor?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head and said, \"This is serving the people.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, what a compliment...\"\n\nSoon, the group returned to the study with various cleaning tools.\n\nWang Jizhong walked to the desk, examined the bloodstains nearby, and thought about where to start.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong took a bottle of cola from the toolbox and threw it to Wang Jizhong.\n\nWang Jizhong, who was in a daze, almost missed catching it. After realizing it was a bottle of cola, he asked blankly, \"I don't drink this.\"\n\n\"This isn't for you to drink. I saw online that cola can clean blood. Try it and see how it works?\"\n\nWang Jizhong looked at Shen Lingdong with doubt, then opened the cola bottle. However, the bottle had been shaken violently when he caught it, and the gas inside was abundant. The moment he opened it, the cola inside sprayed everywhere.\n\nThe cola bubbled out.\n\nWang Jizhong immediately panicked and instinctively used his mouth to cover the bottle opening.\n\nThe next moment, Wang Jizhong was stunned. His gas mask and goggles were covered in cola.\n\nThe others chuckled unashamedly.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately said, \"Did you forget you're wearing a protective suit?\"\n\nWang Jizhong sighed silently, looked at Shen Lingdong helplessly, and said, \"I don't think this will be very effective. Although it's a carbonated drink, couldn't we use hydrochloric acid?\"\n\n\"The cost is too high.\"\n\nWang Jizhong wiped his goggles with a rag and then poured the cola onto the bloodstains. The next step was to wait for them to mix thoroughly and dissolve the solidified blood.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong stared blankly at the cola residue on Wang Jizhong's body. After a long while, he slowly said, \"You know, why did Qi Shuang cook for everyone?\"\n\nWang Jizhong looked up at Shen Lingdong and then said, \"How would I know? Besides, it's self-heating food, what kind of cooking is that?\"\n\n\"If I got blood on me and didn't want anyone to find out, the best way would be to change clothes. It's not unreasonable for a girl to change clothes, right? What if someone saw Qi Shuang absorbing something, and she was worried it might arouse suspicion, so she used cooking as an excuse?\"\n\nWang Jizhong hesitated slightly and said, \"Every room has a bathroom, why would she need to go to the kitchen?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and called out to Zhao Xiaofei outside, \"Xiaofei, come here.\"\n\n\"Coming, did you find something?\" Zhao Xiaofei rushed into the room upon hearing Shen Lingdong call him.\n\n\"Tell me about Qi Shuang.\"\n\n\"Qi Shuang, ah...\" Zhao Xiaofei quickly took out his phone and said, \"Qi Shuang, 25 years old, is a lawyer. She arrived at the villa with Qiu Gao at 9:43 AM. She was the only one among everyone who brought a suitcase; the others had backpacks. However, we found Qiu Gao's fingerprints in her suitcase. Besides some cosmetics, her suitcase also contained some medicine, a charger, toiletries, and several sets of clothes and shoes.\"\n\n\"Several sets of clothes?\" Shen Lingdong pressed.\n\n\"Over ten pieces, plus a pair of slippers, a pair of cotton slippers, a pair of sneakers, and leather shoes.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, turned to Wang Jizhong, and asked, \"Is it normal for a girl to pack so many clothes when she goes out?\"\n\nWang Jizhong blinked and shook his head.\n\nShen Lingdong then looked at Zhao Xiaofei and Xu Tao.\n\nBoth of them quickly shook their heads and said in unison, \"We don't know, we haven't had girlfriends.\"\n\nFinally, Shen Lingdong turned his pleading gaze to Zheng Daoguang, who was the only married person among them.\n\nZheng Daoguang crossed his arms, looking smug, and said, \"Now you know my importance. According to my experience, if my wife goes out, two outfits are enough, and she washes the used clothes immediately.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and said to everyone, \"How about we ask the other girls?\"\n\nBecause the group was wearing protective suits, it was inconvenient to handle their phones, so all their phones were kept by Zhao Xiaofei. After Zhao Xiaofei returned their phones, everyone started messaging to inquire.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then sent a message to Gu Caiwei.\n\n\"If you went out for three days, how many clothes would you pack?\"\n\nA moment later, Gu Caiwei replied to Shen Lingdong, saying, \"Four or five sets should be enough, right? Who are you taking out? No, aren't you on a mission? Why are you going out?\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at the others. They had also received answers, and although their answers varied, none of them packed that many clothes because it would be too heavy, and they would struggle to drag the large suitcase.\n\n\"Continue,\" Shen Lingdong said to Zhao Xiaofei.\n\nZhao Xiaofei then said, \"Qi Shuang's profession is a lawyer. She has been practicing for three years, mainly handling civil litigation cases. The most recent case was about a month ago, where a girl helped an elderly person who had fallen on her way home. The elderly person sued the girl, claiming she hit him and demanding 50,000 yuan in compensation. She was the defendant's lawyer, and because the police found witnesses, she won the case. The girl was considered a Good Samaritan.\"\n\n\"Was the evidence very conclusive?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\nZhao Xiaofei shook his head and said, \"The place where the incident occurred was rather secluded, with not many pedestrians around. It was also quite dark. The incident caused quite a stir online because the old woman's legs were already not good, and most netizens believed that the old woman had fallen by herself and accidentally bumped into the kind girl who helped her up, and was therefore trying to extort money.\"\n\nShen Lingdong suddenly realized, remembering a news story he had seen online a while ago about an old lady faking an accident.\n\nZhao Xiaofei's expression became solemn, and he continued to say to Shen Lingdong, \"The old woman passed away a month ago. For the elderly, once they fall, it's easy...\"\n\nAt this point, Zhao Xiaofei's eyes reddened, and he added, \"That's how my grandfather died... When he passed away, I was on a mission and couldn't go back to see him one last time.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed and walked to Zhao Xiaofei's side, gently patting his shoulder to comfort him.\n\nZhao Xiaofei looked at Shen Lingdong and forced a smile, then continued, \"At that time, the old woman's grandson was very agitated. He insisted that the girl and Qi Shuang should pay the price. We investigated the old woman's grandson. After his grandmother passed away, although he was depressed for a while, his life quickly returned to normal, and he had no connection to any of the people present here. That's about all the information on her. I'll go downstairs to make a call and will be back shortly.\"\n\nWith that, Zhao Xiaofei walked downstairs.\n\nZheng Daoguang then said, \"If there's no surveillance and no eyewitnesses, this kind of thing is very difficult to handle. That girl was also lucky.\"\n\nShen Lingdong took out his phone and searched the internet for the news. Most of what he found were official reports.\n\nThere were very few personal accounts. After reading several news articles, the comment sections mostly stated that the old woman was faking an accident and the girl was wronged.\n\nShen Lingdong, not understanding the situation, did not comment.\n\nHowever, could this be the reason for Qi Shuang's death? If the old woman's grandson wanted revenge, why didn't he directly retaliate against the girl herself but instead targeted her lawyer?\n\nFurthermore, there was no overlap between the suspects who killed Qi Shuang and the suspects who killed Cao Jiazhi. Could there be more than one killer?\n\nPerhaps, there was also a possibility that one of them, after committing the murder, was then murdered.\n\nHowever, in that case, the last person could only commit suicide.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then turned to Wang Jizhong and said, \"Old Wang, let's go to Qi Shuang's room again.\"\n\nWang Jizhong shook his head and said, \"I'm not going. I've discovered a very serious problem.\"\n\n\"What problem?\" Shen Lingdong quickly asked.\n\n\"You've caused me trouble. I stepped on cola on the sole of my shoe just now, and now it's sticky wherever I walk.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was taken aback. He had completely overlooked this matter. Regardless of whether it had cleaning effects, if it dried, it would also be very difficult to clean.\n\n\"Then spray a layer of cleaning agent first. I'll go to Qi Shuang's room myself.\"\n\n\"You're going to ditch me after playing your trick?\" Wang Jizhong said to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly went downstairs. As soon as he reached the second floor, he saw Zhao Xiaofei walking upstairs after finishing his phone call.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly called out, \"Xiaofei, let's go check out Qi Shuang's room together.\"\n\n\"Okay, coming. I've realized I've completely become your subordinate.\" Zhao Xiaofei quickened his pace. He had just gone out for some fresh air and felt much better.\n\nWalking up to Shen Lingdong, Zhao Xiaofei smiled slightly and asked Shen Lingdong, \"Guess who I just called?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Gu Caiwei, Chief Group Leader.\"\n\n\"Oh, to inquire about the cleaning progress?\" Shen Lingdong replied without thinking.\n\n\"She asked me if I was with you. It sounded like she was checking up on me.\"\n\nShen Lingdong snorted, \"Checking up on what? It seems she's very idle, calling you and delaying our progress.\"\n\n\"Don't, don't misunderstand her. She's just worried about delaying your work and specifically asked me to call her back when I had time. She's so considerate, don't you have any thoughts about her?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Zhao Xiaofei and then said, \"You and Liao Jia have known each other for a long time, why aren't you together yet?\"",

    "content": "Special Scene Cleanup Crew\n\nShen Lingdong and Zhao Xiaofei arrived at Qi Shuang's room, 202.\n\nOn the white bedsheet, a patch of dried, blackened blood was particularly striking.\n\nShen Lingdong carefully examined the bloodstain on the bedsheet, then asked Zhao Xiaofei, \"What did the forensic examiner say about the wound?\"\n\n\"Through autopsy, there was a 12 cm x 4 cm hollow subcutaneous hemorrhage on the left temporoparietal area, with slight central depression and cystic changes under the skin. There was a 7 cm x 4 cm subcutaneous hemorrhage. Hemorrhage of the temporalis muscles on both sides, comminuted fracture of the left temporal bone with central depression, 7 cm wide, and comminuted fracture of the left middle cranial fossa and posterior cranial fossa. The murder weapon is suspected to be a wooden club,\" Zhao Xiaofei read from his phone.\n\n\"Has the murder weapon been found?\" Shen Lingdong continued to ask.\n\nZhao Xiaofei shook his head and said, \"No murder weapon or suspected murder weapon was found at the scene.\"\n\n\"Was anything found on her phone?\"\n\n\"Nothing special.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, then continued to examine the room, asking, \"Are her clothes okay?\"\n\n\"If there was a problem, I would have told you already. If, according to your theory, Qi Shuang killed Cao JiaZhi, and bloodstains were on his clothes, we would have found them.\"\n\n\"You checked their home surveillance, right? What was he wearing when he left, and was that outfit found in her luggage?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"It was found.\"\n\n\"So the police believe Qi Shuang couldn't have killed Cao JiaZhi, correct?\"\n\n\"There's no evidence.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed silently, then said, \"Everyone is dead, where would there still be evidence?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Shen Lingdong went to the bed, lifted the top blanket, and checked around the pillow. He then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"She doesn't seem to have stayed on the bed.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei leaned closer to look, then asked, \"How can you tell?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then explained, \"On the floor in front of the sofa in the living room where Qi Shuang sat, some hairs were found. They were also found in the dining room. Qi Shuang didn't stay in those two places for very long, so her hair is the type that falls out easily. But none were found on the bed. Therefore, it's highly likely she didn't stay on the bed.\"\n\nWith that, Shen Lingdong knelt on the floor and carefully examined it, finally finding a few hairs near the windowsill.\n\nShen Lingdong held the hairs and said, \"If we can find similar hairs in other parts of the resort, we can probably determine where Qi Shuang has been. Let Old Wang take a look at these hairs as well, and have them help with the search.\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Wang Jizhong pushed open the door, making a heart gesture with his thumb and index finger.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Wang Jizhong, then his lips curved slightly, and he returned the same gesture to Wang Jizhong.\n\nZhao Xiaofei looked at the two of them and couldn't help but complain, \"You two, be mindful. We're at a crime scene!\"\n\nWang Jizhong waved his hand and said to Shen Lingdong, \"What are you making hearts for? I have something to give you. I just found a woman's hair in the study.\"\n\nShen Lingdong raised his right hand and showed it to Zhao Xiaofei, saying, \"Take a good look. I'm holding hair too. You should be paying attention.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei took a closer look and then laughed, \"If you don't look closely, no one can see it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong turned to Wang Jizhong and said, \"I was just saying that with these hairs, we should be able to determine where Qi Shuang has been.\"\n\nWang Jizhong paused slightly and casually replied, \"Okay, I'll have Xu Tao look for them. My old eyes are blurry, I probably won't see them even if there are hairs...\"\n\n\"Let's go together.\"\n\n\"Huh? What's the difference between this and finding a needle in a haystack?\"\n\nThe group went outside and began to divide the tasks.\n\nShen Lingdong was responsible for the third floor, Zheng Daoguang and Zhao Xiaofei for the second floor, while Wang Jizhong and Xu Tao were responsible for the first floor.\n\nAlthough this method was somewhat inhumane, after two hours of busy work, they still found Qi Shuang's hair in several locations.\n\nThe group convened, and it was found that Qi Shuang's hair had been found in a total of eight locations in the resort: the study, room 202, room 302, room 201, the entertainment hall on the second floor, the dining room, the kitchen, and the sofa in the living room.\n\nAmong these, room 201 was Qiu Gao's room, and room 302 was Jing Liang's room. Qi Shuang and Qiu Gao had drunk there.\n\nAt this point, Wang Jizhong slowly said, \"Except for some guest rooms, the public restroom on the first floor, and the front desk, Qi Shuang's hair was not found. Also, the movie theater, gym, and lounge area on the second floor, and the conference room on the third floor did not have Qi Shuang's hair.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and then said, \"The places where they appeared, we can vaguely guess the reasons for her presence there. But under the circumstances of murder, going to the entertainment hall, I can't quite figure it out. However, we have a general idea of Qi Shuang's activities from noon until she was murdered.\"\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei slowly said, \"We found that five chairs in the entertainment hall had been moved, indicating that only five people were present in the entertainment hall at that time.\"\n\nWang Jizhong recalled for a moment and said, \"The police have determined that Song Ming was the last to die, and we inferred that Cao JiaZhi was the first to die. Moreover, the time of death for Jing Liang, Qiu Gao, and Qi Shuang was relatively late. If they were in the entertainment hall at night, without lights, they basically couldn't do anything. So, I think they were in the entertainment hall during the day, that is, before Jing Liang, Qiu Gao, and Qi Shuang were murdered.\"\n\nAt this point, Wang Jizhong paused and looked at the reactions of the others.\n\nShen Lingdong rubbed his chin expressionlessly, while Zhao Xiaofei was lost in thought. The other two looked confused.\n\nZhao Xiaofei then asked, \"So the victims could be Gao Qing or Lu Fei?\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded again and then said, \"Being burned to death is a relatively painful way to die, but one thing I can't understand is how they ensured he wouldn't be discovered by others.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei then said, \"Everyone saw the situation in the kitchen. There were no signs of burning in the kitchen, and his autopsy report also showed that his body had been moved after Lu Fei's death. So, we should look for other places in the resort where there are signs of burning.\"\n\n\"Could there have been some enclosed space where even if Lu Fei screamed loudly, others couldn't hear?\" Xu Tao suddenly interjected from the side.\n\nWang Jizhong continued, \"Can the oxygen in an enclosed space support combustion for a long time? And the victim's body would become distorted due to struggles before death, but the marks we saw on the kitchen floor showed Lu Fei's body was placed neatly. And judging by the residues, the body was severely burned.\"\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei nodded and said, \"The skin had already carbonized.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at Zhao Xiaofei, \"Tell me about Lu Fei.\"\n\n\"Lu Fei was a programmer at a company and had good relationships with his colleagues. However, four months ago, he had a dispute with his boss over salary. He asked for a raise, but was rejected. In his subsequent work, he was marginalized, and his bonuses were greatly reduced. Two months ago, he resigned. However, when he left, he took the company's core source code with him. A month ago, a competitor launched the software first. His former company's boss, having lost the opportunity, declared bankruptcy.\"\n\n\"His boss's act of revenge?\" Wang Jizhong asked.\n\n\"After the company went bankrupt, their boss disappeared. The police are currently tracking down the whereabouts of their boss, Jiang Wei,\" Zhao Xiaofei continued.\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at Zhao Xiaofei and then said, \"He is a suspect you are targeting?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei was slightly taken aback and retorted, \"How do you know?\"\n\n\"This person holds a different position in your mind. You didn't mention the names of people related to Cao JiaZhi or Qi Shuang, but you mentioned this person's name. This indicates that this person's identity is unusual,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"Alright, he is indeed a suspect we are investigating.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued:\n\n\"Among all the murders that occurred in the resort, Lu Fei's case is more difficult. First, the method of committing the crime is difficult. Second, moving the body is difficult. It's probably not easy for one person to drag the body of an adult. It would be difficult to do it without anyone noticing. If those five people were in the recreation room during the day, then by dinner time, excluding Qi Shuang, Qiu Gao, and Jing Liang, only two people would remain. However, there were three meal boxes on the dining table. Therefore, I think they were in the recreation room after dinner. So, before entering the recreation room, there were still six of them.\"\n\n\"Since the difficulty of murdering Lu Fei is greater, I am more inclined to believe it was Gao Qing, who died of suffocation.\"\n\n\"While Qi Shuang, Qiu Gao, and Jing Liang were drinking in their rooms, another person carried out the more difficult method of murder, which was dealing with Lu Fei.\"\n\n\"At this point, the remaining survivors are Qi Shuang, Qiu Gao, Jing Liang, and Song Ming. Except for Song Ming, the time of death for the other three cannot be determined for now?\"\n\nZheng Daoguang then slowly said, \"I have a question. Since Song Ming was the last to die, could he be the one who killed everyone and then committed suicide? Perhaps his purpose in gathering these people here was not pure.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately replied, \"As I said before, because Song Ming's fingerprints were not found on the guardrail, and the height of the guardrail is about 1.5 meters, if he wanted to jump off the building to commit suicide, he would need to run for a while, then use a high jump with a backward roll to get over the guardrail and land. Therefore, he must have been lifted and thrown downstairs.\"\n\n\"That means there were other people at the scene?\"\n\nShen Lingdong's expression was grave, and he did not reply to Zheng Daoguang. Instead, he stared out the window, lost in thought. After a long while, he slowly turned back and said to everyone, \"There is no surveillance here, and they don't know each other. The killer could have easily blended in.\"\n\nThe crowd exchanged glances, and Wang Jizhong looked as if he was deep in thought.\n\nA moment later, Shen Lingdong continued, \"Lu Fei's body was moved, and it was so charred that his face couldn't be seen clearly. Others wouldn't know who was dead. There is another possibility, which is that everyone simply didn't know Lu Fei was dead. The real Lu Fei might have died that day, but his body was only brought in after everyone else had already died.\"\n\nWang Jizhong's body trembled, and he quickly said, \"I am more inclined to believe the latter.\"\n\n\"Regardless of the method, it was raining heavily at the time. If the place where Lu Fei was burned was too far away, it would be easy to have an accident on such difficult terrain. Even normal people would find it hard to walk, let alone carry a body. There would definitely be traces left on the body. If no traces were left, it means the place where Lu Fei was burned was not far from here.\"\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Shen Lingdong said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Xiaofei, let's go out and take a look.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei did not move his feet. He stood in place and hesitated for a moment before saying, \"The surrounding area is quite large. Why don't I call some colleagues to help with the search?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated. The area was indeed too vast. With just the two of them, even if they searched until dark, they might not find anything. But he still wanted to try. After a moment of thought, he said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Notify Lin Xiangbei. They should arrive here in about an hour. Let's search for an hour, and if we don't find anything, we'll stop. The others can clean up the study. Time is almost up.\"\n\nWang Jizhong snorted, \"You don't want to be lazy for an hour, do you?\"\n\n\"Can't I?\" Shen Lingdong retorted.\n\n\"Of course, you can. You're the boss, you can do whatever you want?\" Wang Jizhong said helplessly.\n\nAt this moment, Zheng Daoguang cleared his throat and said, \"Actually, I'm also a shareholder...\"\n\nXu Tao also said from the side, \"Although I'm part of the cleanup crew, I'm also from the regular cleaning team. My job in the cleanup crew is just transportation.\"\n\n\"So, it's just me then?\" Wang Jizhong grumbled.\n\n\"Keep going,\" Shen Lingdong said, leaving a sentence, and then walked outside. Zhao Xiaofei quickly followed.\n\nStanding at the entrance of the resort, Zhao Xiaofei looked around and sighed silently. He didn't know where to start. They couldn't possibly conduct a carpet search by themselves.\n\n\"Team Leader Shen, what are your instructions?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Let's start investigating from the south.\"\n\n\"Why? I think starting from the north is fine too.\"\n\n\"Oh, then you go north, and I'll go south.\" With that, Shen Lingdong strode towards the south of the resort.\n\nA moment later, Zhao Xiaofei caught up and asked Shen Lingdong, \"I'll still go with you. But why investigate the south first?\"\n\n\"We need a direction, don't we?\"\n\n\"Sigh, I thought you had deduced it.\"",

    "content": "A Special Scene Cleaner\n\nYuhai Villa was built in a valley between two mountains.\n\nThe mountain to the north was quite steep, while the slope of the mountain to the south was somewhat gentler.\n\nShen Lingdong followed a path that could barely be called a road, searching towards the south.\n\n\"Don't be fooled by how it looks now. Once it starts raining, it gets very difficult to travel here, and there's also the risk of landslides. There have been several incidents here before. Someone was going up the mountain, encountered heavy rain halfway, and when they reached this point, a landslide occurred, burying them completely. The reason for this was the deforestation of the trees in front. Wu Anguo originally planned to build a timber processing plant here. However, after cutting down the forest in that area, the timber processing plant plan was also delayed. Later, Wu Anguo built a villa here, originally intending to develop it into a hotel, but that project was also not implemented.\"\n\nJust as Zhao Xiaofei finished speaking, Shen Lingdong stumbled. Fortunately, his agility allowed him to grab onto a small tree nearby, preventing him from falling.\n\nAfterward, Shen Lingdong sighed, \"Even if there were any traces left, they would have likely been washed away by the continuous heavy rain for several days.\"\n\n\"Are we still going up?\"\n\nShen Lingdong turned back to look at the villa. From here, due to the obstruction of the trees, he could barely see the top of the villa. He then continued to walk upwards.\n\nAs he walked upwards, he kept looking back. He could see the second floor of the villa, and after walking a bit further, he could see the entire villa. However, the villa now appeared very small in Shen Lingdong's eyes, so he stopped.\n\n\"Why did you stop?\" Zhao Xiaofei asked.\n\nShen Lingdong turned to look at Zhao Xiaofei and then said, \"Let's stop here. If we go any higher, because it's raining, the visibility isn't very high. Even if a fire source appeared, it wouldn't be visible from the villa.\"\n\n\"Someone saw a fire source here?\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately said, \"I'm not entirely sure, but I estimate that Qi Shuang stood by the windowsill for quite some time. Perhaps she was tidying her hair while on the phone. Otherwise, the hair near the windowsill wouldn't have fallen out so much. Also, I found some ash near the windowsill in Qiu Gao's room. He might have been there too. So, I suspect that both of them might have seen a fire on the mountain. Since their rooms face south, we only need to search in this direction.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei was slightly taken aback and said, \"Isn't this a deduction rather than just guessing?\"\n\n\"It's just guessing. Any deduction without evidence is just guessing.\"\n\nA hint of admiration appeared in Zhao Xiaofei's eyes. He sincerely praised Shen Lingdong, saying, \"Actually, when Lin Xiangbei first asked me to follow you to learn, I was a bit unconvinced. We learned the same things in school, so why should I follow you to learn? Now I finally understand where the difference lies!\"\n\n\"Stop the nonsense and hurry up and search. The killer wanted to start a fire outdoors in the rain. They would need a place that could shelter them from the wind and rain, and this place couldn't be too small.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei nodded.\n\nThen, the two separated and walked down the mountain, one to the left and one to the right.\n\nAfter searching the mountain for nearly an hour, the two found nothing.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong was sitting on a flat rock, resting.\n\nZhao Xiaofei came to Shen Lingdong's side and said softly, \"My colleagues have arrived. I'll go pick them up.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nZhao Xiaofei then started walking down the mountain.\n\nShen Lingdong sat on the rock and looked at Yuhai Villa. From this position, he could see the entire south side of Yuhai Villa.\n\nSuddenly, Shen Lingdong noticed something was amiss. He looked down at the rock beneath him. This rock was too flat, and it was too comfortable to sit on.\n\nShen Lingdong then looked under the rock. Beneath this rock, two smaller stones were placed to keep the rock flat. Shen Lingdong quickly stood up and called out to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Xiaofei, look at this rock?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei returned to Shen Lingdong's side, examined the rock, and then said to Shen Lingdong, \"This rock didn't appear here naturally. It was moved here by someone?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"So, the fire source should not be far from here.\"\n\nThe two then began searching the vicinity. Before long, Zhao Xiaofei shouted, \"Shen Lingdong, there's a cave here.\"\n\nShen Lingdong ran towards Zhao Xiaofei. He saw Zhao Xiaofei pushing aside a small bush. After pulling out a few small shrubs, an opening appeared before their eyes. This cave was not very large, only about three meters deep, with a width and height of about two meters. The cave walls inside were made of stacked stones. Those stones had been blackened by smoke.\n\n\"I'll call my colleagues to come up now.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the bushes piled around the cave and then said to Zhao Xiaofei in surprise, \"Do you know how developed the root systems of bushes are? You pulled them out with one hand each?\"\n\n\"I originally intended to just push them aside, but I used too much force and ended up pulling them out!\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the bushes in front of him, then reached out and pulled hard. To his surprise, they came right out of the soil. He threw the bushes aside and said, \"This is what the killer replanted to conceal the cave. If they hadn't done this, after a few days, the trees would have withered and stood out significantly from their surroundings, making them obvious at a glance.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei nodded, then looked into the cave and said, \"It seems like this is where Lu Fei was burned to death.\"\n\n\"Most likely. However, this also proves that there may be more than one killer. It's possible that one of them impersonated Lu Fei in the villa, while the other burned Lu Fei to death here and waited for a signal from the fake Lu Fei.\"\n\nAt this moment, the police arrived. Lin Xiangbei was busy with other matters and did not come. Seeing that Shen Lingdong and Zhao Xiaofei had found the cave, the police immediately began collecting evidence.\n\nWhile the evidence was being collected, Shen Lingdong returned to the villa. Although the police couldn't produce immediate results, according to Shen Lingdong's estimation, Lu Fei was very likely murdered there. He needed to go back and continue investigating the other individuals.\n\nThe rooms of Qiu Gao, Gao Qing, Jing Liang, and Song Ming remained to be investigated.\n\nApart from the presence of vomit in Jing Liang's room and a large amount of blood splatter in Qiu Gao's room, the other rooms were quite normal, even retaining their original appearance.\n\nAfter another search and finding no evidence, Shen Lingdong began the cleanup work.\n\nIt was late by the time they finished working.\n\nSince the villa had lost power, they decided to leave and return the next day.\n\nAfter locking the doors and windows and preparing to leave, Zhao Xiaofei returned.\n\nUpon seeing Zhao Xiaofei, Shen Lingdong quickly asked, \"Did you get any results?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei nodded and then said, \"After comparison, the black residue found in the cave is the same as the residue on Lu Fei's body. It has been confirmed that this is where Lu Fei was murdered.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was not too surprised. He nodded lightly and said, \"It's too late today. We'll continue tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Are the doors and windows all locked?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei said to Shen Lingdong, \"Brother Wang, you ride in my car, and I'll ride in Shen Lingdong's car back.\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded, then pointed to the toolbox on the ground and said, \"Then help me move these things to Shen Lingdong's car as well.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Old Wang walked towards the police car not far away, while Zheng Daoguang and Xu Tao drove back in a van.\n\nAfter Shen Lingdong loaded all the items into the car, he asked Zhao Xiaofei in the back seat, \"What did you want to say?\"\n\n\"Team Leader Lin reinvestigated the lawsuit that Qi Shuang had filed. Guess what they found?\"\n\n\"Don't beat around the bush, just say it.\"\n\n\"Qi Shuang perjured herself. There weren't many pedestrians on the road that day, and no one saw anything. However, Team Leader Lin found a video online. Before the girl hit the old man, someone had already filmed the old man lying on the ground. It was this video that led to the old man being verbally attacked online for faking an accident. This video had no original source. In fact, the video was fabricated. Qi Xue arranged for someone to stage it, and she did it when there were witnesses on the road. She also deliberately delayed finding witnesses for a long time. Because the witnesses were all elderly, after a period of time, they couldn't remember the exact day. However, they saw an old man lying on the ground, then a girl on a bicycle stopped next to him, helped him up, and took him to the hospital.\"\n\n\"How did Team Leader Lin discover this?\" Shen Lingdong retorted.\n\n\"Team Leader Lin had encountered a water army organizer in a previous case. He found that person's name in Qi Shuang's transfer records, which led him to realize that Qi Shuang had hired a water army to create public opinion about the old man faking an accident. After some investigation, it was discovered that the video was fabricated. Guess who posted the video?\"\n\n\"Don't beat around the bush.\"\n\n\"Qiu Gao. The video was uploaded through his account, and then he saved the video by screen recording and deleted the original video. The original video would have revealed the original filming time. After questioning the girl who hit the old man, she confessed that she did hit the old man, but she also took him to the hospital and was prepared to compensate him. However, as a friend, Qi Shuang gave her a terrible idea...\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed quietly. \"Even so, the old man cannot be resurrected.\"\n\n\"In addition, here's a piece of information for you: the old man's grandson has also gone missing? His parents reported him missing today. They haven't been able to contact their son for over half a month.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and then asked, \"Do you have a photo of the old man's grandson?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWhile waiting for the traffic light, Zhao Xiaofei took out his phone and showed it to Shen Lingdong. He then said, \"His name is Sun Fanyi, and he is 22 years old this year.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the photo. A slightly chubby young man wearing black-rimmed glasses, he looked very ordinary and was unlikely to be the person impersonating Lu Fei. \"It looks like he just entered society...\"\n\n\"I reported our deductions to Team Leader Lin. Team Leader Lin believes that he is unlikely to be the person impersonating Lu Fei, nor is he likely to be the one who burned Lu Fei to death. Team Leader Lin asked me to ask you, if it were you, what would you do?\"\n\nShen Lingdong turned to look at Zhao Xiaofei and then smiled slightly. He then said, \"You're just asking me because he told you to?\"\n\n\"Isn't this learning how to analyze from you?\"\n\n\"If it were me... I would pursue legal channels...\" Shen Lingdong said with a smile, then turned his gaze forward. The smile on his face gradually disappeared.\n\nIf, when comparing this case to his father's case, Sun Fanyi firmly believed his grandmother did not fake an accident, and his grandmother died because of it, would Sun Fanyi seek revenge? If he firmly believed his father was not guilty, but his father went to prison, would he go to any lengths to rescue his father?\n\nTeam Leader Lin wanted to hear his opinion on Sun Fanyi, which was also a probe into his thoughts on his father's case.\n\nShen Lingdong and Zhao Xiaofei both fell silent. Apart from the sound of the car moving, there was no sound in the car.\n\nAfter a long while, Shen Lingdong spoke, asking, \"Tell me about Song Ming. As a second-generation rich kid, why didn't he drive himself to the villa, but chose to take a taxi?\"\n\n\"He drove drunk half a year ago, and his driver's license was suspended. In fact, he was just released from detention. Although he is a rich second generation, his parents basically ignored him. He has many bad behaviors. If he can settle things with money, he uses money. If he can't settle things with money, he'll go to jail for a while. He has many friends, but they are all superficial friends.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then said, \"Then how did he get himself into a life-or-death situation? Does he have a girlfriend?\"\n\n\"More than one. At the time of his death, he was dating three girlfriends. However, we learned that he was quite introverted in school and would blush when talking to girls.\"\n\n\"Some scumbags are born that way, some are made by hurt...\"\n\n\"You're also a scumbag...\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and looked at Zhao Xiaofei in confusion, \"Aren't you?\"\n\n\"I'm very devoted, alright?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly and then said, \"Although our relationship wasn't good in school, I always heard that your secret crushes changed one after another?\"\n\n\"I'm just saying that.\"\n\n\"What a scumbag tone...\"\n\n\"Alright, let's stop talking about this. Do you have any more questions? If not, I'm leaving.\"\n\n\"No more. But you should carefully investigate Song Ming's past. The ones investigated so far all have a motive for being killed. I don't believe Song Ming doesn't.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei nodded, then opened the car door.\n\nShen Lingdong leaned back in his chair, watching Zhao Xiaofei leave until he disappeared from sight.\n\nHe didn't want to go home yet; he just wanted to stay in the car alone for a while.\n\nAfter thinking about the case for a long time, he found his mind in a mess and couldn't calm down to think. After a brief pause, Shen Lingdong quietly took out his phone and searched for Yuan Yuan's novels online, but he couldn't find them.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated, then sent Yuan Yuan a WeChat message asking, \"Your novel? Why can't I find it?\"\n\n\"It was banned... *sob sob sob*.\"\n\n\"Why was it banned?\"\n\n\"Writing mystery novels is too difficult. They don't allow this, they don't allow that. And they don't allow writing detailed investigation and counter-investigation aspects anymore.\"\n\n\"How detailed can you be?\"\n\n\"Anyway, not as detailed as you.\"",

    "content": "Here is the translation of the provided text:\n\n**Special Scene Cleaner Novel - Chapter 094: Traces**\n\nShen Lingdong flipped through the information on his phone that Zhao Xiaofei had previously sent him about several individuals. He found that Jing Liang's residence was relatively close to his current location, only a thirty-minute drive away.\n\nAfter a brief moment of hesitation, Shen Lingdong decided to go and check his place.\n\nAccording to the information, Jing Liang was a surgeon. His resume showed that he had extensive clinical experience and excellent skills, and his relationships with colleagues were also good. However, he had a classmate in the same department, and the two often competed with each other privately.\n\nIf everything went as planned, he was scheduled to be promoted to associate chief physician today.\n\nHowever, three months ago, Jing Liang was involved in a medical malpractice incident. A patient died on the operating table. Although it was related to the patient's own physical condition and illness, Jing Liang did have some operational errors, which led to his license being suspended for six months.\n\nFor the past three months, Jing Liang had been at home, rarely leaving his room.\n\nUpon arriving at Jing Liang's residential complex, Shen Lingdong stood downstairs, looking up at a unit on the third floor, which was Jing Liang's home. Since Jing Liang did not live with his parents, the apartment was currently unoccupied.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment before heading upstairs. He reached Jing Liang's door and gently knocked. His knocking grew louder until a neighbor heard it and opened their door to check.\n\n\"Who are you looking for?\" a man opened the door and poked his head out.\n\n\"I'm looking for the people who live here,\" Shen Lingdong said, pointing to Jing Liang's apartment.\n\nThe man glanced at it and then said, \"They must have moved. I haven't seen their family for a long time.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then asked, \"Moved?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"The police came to ask questions a while back. The person who lived here was a doctor. I heard he was involved in a medical accident. In the days right after it happened, a woman kept coming to the doctor's house, holding a sign that said 'Give me back my husband.' At first, everyone didn't know what was going on, but later we heard it was a medical accident.\"\n\n\"How old was she?\"\n\n\"Around forty, I think?\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and asked, \"Can you still see her now?\"\n\nThe man recalled for a moment and then said, \"Well, that woman was quite persistent. She was there day and night, for about two months. But I haven't seen her recently. I guess she knows the doctor moved away.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"Maybe they really did move somewhere else... Thanks for the information.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" the man replied and closed his door.\n\nShen Lingdong left Jing Liang's apartment and returned to his car, staring blankly at the entrance of the residential complex.\n\nThe woman hadn't appeared here for a month.\n\nCalculating the time, that period coincided with Lu Fei's incident, just a few days apart. Could it be that she already knew Jing Liang would be harmed soon and stopped protesting there?\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, Shen Lingdong slowly started the car and drove back home.\n\nThe next day.\n\nAt six o'clock, everyone gathered again at Yuhai Villa. The first thing Shen Lingdong did after getting out of the car was to check if the doors and windows had been tampered with. Seeing that they were all intact, he then proceeded to unlock the door and enter the villa.\n\nAfter soaking overnight, the solidified blood had dissolved in the cleaning agent.\n\nShen Lingdong then said to everyone, \"Our work progress was significantly behind yesterday, so today we need to clean the entire third floor and a portion of the second floor. We'll finish the remaining work tomorrow.\"\n\n\"So... no more slacking,\" Wang Jizhong jokingly added from the side.\n\nAt this point, Zhao Xiaofei said to everyone, \"Shen Lingdong was a great help to our police yesterday. We had a meeting last night, and I presented the scene reconstructed by Shen Lingdong. With the information they provided, it has given us a new direction for our investigation, which was completely stalled. We have now identified several suspects.\"\n\n\"Several suspects?\" Wang Jizhong's face showed a hint of doubt.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhao Xiaofei replied.\n\nShen Lingdong slowly spoke, \"I investigated Jing Liang yesterday and found that he had been involved in a medical malpractice incident. The victim's wife had been staying downstairs at his house, but a month ago, the woman suddenly left, and this timing coincided with Jing Liang's death. Song Fei might have been a crime of passion. Qi Shuang might have faced retaliation from the plaintiff's family due to her perjury. Lu Fei might have been targeted for threatening his boss, and Cao JiaZhi might have been targeted for being reported.\"\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei slowly said, \"Now only Gao Qing and Qiu Gao remain.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"I went home last night and reviewed their information. Qiu Gao operates his own self-media, and his account has a certain degree of popularity online. He often expresses his opinions on various social issues. However, his remarks are quite extreme.\"\n\n\"As for Gao Qing, he's a standard ne'er-do-well who lives off his parents. Besides playing games at home every day, he doesn't seem to do anything else. We haven't found a motive for his murder yet, but we can go and check his room first.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you,\" Zhao Xiaofei offered.\n\nShen Lingdong then picked up the toolbox nearby and headed towards room 301.\n\nUpon arriving at room 301, Shen Lingdong inspected the room. Although he was strangled, his room was the most chaotic, with clear signs of a struggle.\n\nAt this point, Zhao Xiaofei said to Shen Lingdong, \"Sister Xi checked the bodies of the others. Apart from Lu Fei, whose body was burned, no other injuries were found on the others.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"The fake Lu Fei who was at the villa has already left.\"\n\nWhile speaking, he picked up a piece of a broken vase from the floor, then examined the walls and the ground. Shen Lingdong found no marks on the wall from the vase being thrown. Based on the scattered location of the fragments, the vase must have been smashed on the floor.\n\nShen Lingdong then proceeded to examine the bookshelf, and in one of the compartments, he found a trace left by evaporated water.\n\nZhao Xiaofei seemed to understand Shen Lingdong's thought process and said, \"This might have been thrown at the killer by the victim during the struggle.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then moved to the other side of the bed and looked at the viscous liquid remaining on the floor. This was the bodily fluid expelled from the corpse. He then looked at Zhao Xiaofei and said, \"This is where the victim's body was discovered, right?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei nodded.\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"I think the room is so messy, it doesn't look like the result of a struggle, but rather the victim deliberately destroying things in a fit of rage.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei frowned.\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"He was addicted to games. If he came here without electricity, his phone battery wouldn't last long. When his phone ran out of power, if his internet addiction was severe, it could cause emotional fluctuations, leading him to destroy items in the room.\"\n\nAfter a brief pause, Shen Lingdong continued, \"Among all his personal belongings, was a power bank found?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei recalled and then shook his head, saying, \"No portable power source was found in their luggage.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, as he had suspected. He then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"I found a large quantity of candles in the warehouse on the first floor, indicating that there are frequent power outages here. It's not like when we were kids, when we often encountered power outages in the entire area. Now, power outages are usually for circuit maintenance. Even if there's still no power, the vending machines can still operate. So, I think they might not have known that there was no electricity here.\"\n\n\"What about the fake Lu Fei?\"\n\n\"Whether the fake Lu Fei knew or not, he would have cleaned up any place where he might have left traces at the villa, or even taken precautions in advance. However, because of Gao Qing's situation, I'm very curious as to why each of them came here...\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei hesitated for a moment, then said to Shen Lingdong, \"Gao Qing's parents told the police that they made a bet with Gao Qing. If he didn't play computer games for seven days, they would agree to buy him a car. After Gao Qing left home, his parents logged into Gao Qing's computer and deleted his game accounts.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"I saw this information. It seems Gao Qing also intended to quit his internet addiction. However, in a place like this, without a phone, it would be hard to last seven days, unless he could find other ways to pass the time.\"\n\n\"What about the others?\" Zhao Xiaofei asked.\n\nShen Lingdong gently shook his head and said, \"We don't know yet, but everyone must have their own reasons for coming here.\"\n\nWith that, he continued to observe the situation in the room. Shen Lingdong checked the corners and asked Zhao Xiaofei, \"What game was he playing?\"\n\n\"A Xianxia-genre leveling game. I heard he was also the leader of a guild.\"\n\n\"Did he make any enemies in the game?\"\n\n\"Often. He was constantly fighting with one player or another. I heard he's already spent twenty to thirty thousand yuan on this game.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Has his game account really been deregistered?\"\n\n\"They only deleted the shortcut files on the desktop. We checked his game account's friend information. Three of them are in Dongjiang City, all his classmates. We've interviewed them all, and we haven't found anything unusual so far.\"\n\n\"Send me the information on those three people.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhao Xiaofei replied and took out his phone. In a moment, he sent the information of the three individuals to Shen Lingdong's phone.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at his phone and hesitated for a moment. He then sent a message to Gu Caiwei: \"Team Leader Gu, how are the victim's families doing emotionally?\"\n\n\"There are too many victims this time, and their emotions are quite unstable. Especially Gao Qing's parents, they are very remorseful about Gao Qing's death, believing they caused his death,\" Gu Caiwei replied to Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"What are their current views on the victim playing online games? Do they blame online games for everything?\"\n\n\"Not really. Gao Qing's mother complained to her husband, saying, 'If he plays games, he plays games, but at least it's safer.'\" Gu Caiwei replied.\n\n\"What's Gao Qing's father's opinion?\" Shen Lingdong continued to ask.\n\n\"He hasn't expressed his opinion, but he also feels some guilt. Gao Qing's mother, however, is showing signs of suicidal ideation, and I visit her daily to provide psychological counseling.\"\n\n\"I can offer you a method. I heard that Gao Qing's parents only deleted the shortcut icons on the computer desktop. If they don't blame online games for Gao Qing's death, you could try to restore them. If they can see their son's game character continuing to be active in the game world, it could be seen as an extension of Gao Qing's life. I'm just providing a reference; you decide whether to implement it.\"\n\nGu Caiwei was silent for a moment, then replied to Shen Lingdong, \"I can try, but I don't know how to restore games?\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, then said, \"It should be in the recycle bin, it's very simple...\"\n\nGu Caiwei: \"I don't know how...\"\n\nShen Lingdong: \"Find a colleague to help.\"\n\nGu Caiwei: \"They're all busy and don't have time.\"\n\nShen Lingdong: \"Then let's do it tonight. After I finish my cleaning work today, I'll go with you.\"\n\nGu Caiwei: \"Okay, I'll wait for you there.\"\n\nShen Lingdong: \"We'll see.\"\n\nAfter putting away his phone, Shen Lingdong looked around again, then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Let's clean this place up first.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei looked displeased and said to Shen Lingdong, \"Fine, you really treat me like your employee.\"\n\nThe two then proceeded to clean Gao Qing's room.\n\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon, Shen Lingdong had completed the cleaning tasks for the day. He reviewed the remaining work. If nothing unexpected happened, the cleaning would be completed by tomorrow afternoon.\n\nHe organized the garbage bags and loaded them onto Xu Tao's disposal truck.\n\nThe temperature was not high at night. When everyone took off their protective suits, you could even see steam rising from their bodies. Shen Lingdong's clothes were soaked. He checked the time and told everyone to go home, and to gather again at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.\n\nShen Lingdong returned home, took a shower, changed into clean clothes, and then headed to the police station.\n\nHe arrived at the police station at five-thirty. Shen Lingdong parked his car by the roadside, waiting for Gu Caiwei. After an unknown amount of time, the drowsy Shen Lingdong suddenly heard a knocking sound on the car window.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly opened his eyes and saw Gu Caiwei standing outside the car.\n\nSeeing that Shen Lingdong was awake, Gu Caiwei walked around to the passenger side and got into the car. She then said to Shen Lingdong, \"Why were you still asleep? Are you too tired?\"\n\n\"I'm alright. Where does Gao Qing's family live?\" Shen Lingdong asked casually.",

    "content": "Jiangyue Residential Area.\n\nShen Lingdong and Gu Caiwei bought some fruit at a nearby supermarket to visit Gao Qing's parents.\n\nA bit confused by this behavior, Shen Lingdong asked Gu Caiwei, \"I have a question. For the psychological counseling of the deceased's family, why establish a special aftermath team for counseling, when it's just about providing as much counseling as possible?\"\n\nGu Caiwei looked at Shen Lingdong in confusion. \"A psychologist conducted a statistic, analyzing the psychological problems of families of all difficult cases. After the deceased's family members emerged from the pain of losing a loved one, the case-solving efficiency greatly improved. Do you know why?\"\n\n\"Why?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Most of the deceased's family members carry self-blame, hatred for the killer, or other emotional influences. At this time, they cannot think calmly like ordinary people, and they will judge the killer's identity based on their subjective judgment. Therefore, their words are not objective. They might even overlook important clues on others to increase suspicion on someone, which is caused by psychological suggestion, not their intended behavior. However, when they emerge from grief, the clues they provide will be more objective and greatly assist the police in solving the case. This is what our family aftermath team does – to help them emerge from grief as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\n\"Besides, we have funding for this,\" Gu Caiwei said with a smile.\n\n\"I have another question. What kind of psychologist would conduct such research?\"\n\n\"The great psychologist Gu,\" Gu Caiwei replied, raising her hand and handing the fruit bag to Shen Lingdong. \"Aren't you going to carry it for me?\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at it, then took the fruit bag from Gu Caiwei and continued walking upstairs.\n\nArriving at Unit 1, Room 502, Gu Caiwei knocked on Gao Qing's door.\n\nA moment later, an old man, nearly sixty years old, opened the door. The old man had a somber expression and looked unwell.\n\n\"Uncle Gao, I've come to see you again?\"\n\nUncle Gao glanced at Gu Caiwei, then at Shen Lingdong standing behind her, and then said, \"Come in.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback. If the police frequently disturbed them, they would also feel annoyed. He didn't expect them to have a good attitude towards Gu Caiwei.\n\nJust as Shen Lingdong was about to take out shoe covers to put on his shoes, Gu Caiwei nudged him, then took a pair of men's slippers from Uncle Gao and handed them to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong then handed the fruit bag to Gu Caiwei.\n\nGu Caiwei smiled at Uncle Gao and said, \"Uncle Gao, have you finished the fruit I brought last time? I've brought a few different kinds again this time.\"\n\n\"Don't buy any more. We old folks can't eat much. There's still a lot left from last time.\"\n\n\"You need to eat more. These fruits are especially good for the elderly. I'll wash some for you in a bit, and I'll watch you eat them.\"\n\nGu Caiwei said as she carried the fruit towards the kitchen, her movements very practiced, as if she were in her own home. Gao Qing's parents didn't show any displeasure; instead, they even showed slight smiles.\n\nAunt Gao followed Gu Caiwei into the kitchen to wash the fruit. Uncle Gao glanced at Shen Lingdong and then said, \"Sit anywhere you like. The house is a bit messy, don't mind.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\nShen Lingdong suddenly felt a little nervous for some reason, as if he were a son-in-law meeting his father-in-law for the first time. He nodded at Uncle Gao and then obediently sat on the sofa.\n\nSoon, Gu Caiwei and Aunt Gao came out of the kitchen. Gu Caiwei was carrying a fruit plate and placed it on the coffee table, taking out two apples and handing them to Uncle Gao and Aunt Gao.\n\nAt this moment, Uncle Gao looked at Gu Caiwei and asked, \"Little Gu, the case has progressed, and several days have passed. As long as the killer isn't caught, your aunt and I can't sleep for a single day.\"\n\nGu Caiwei immediately comforted Uncle Gao, saying, \"We have gathered some clues. Uncle Gao, please don't worry. We will not let the killer get away with it.\"\n\n\"Alas, it's all our fault.\" Uncle Gao sighed.\n\nGu Caiwei had heard this phrase countless times from Uncle Gao, but she still tried to comfort them. \"Uncle Gao, Aunt Gao, this is not your fault. The fault lies with the killer. Gao Qing wouldn't want to see you like this either.\"\n\nJust then, Shen Lingdong patted his pocket and took out a letter, handing it to Uncle Gao. He said, \"Uncle, this is a letter we found in Gao Qing's room at Yunhai Manor.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he handed the letter to Uncle Gao.\n\nUncle Gao took the letter and began reading it with Aunt Gao.\n\nGu Caiwei frowned and sat next to Shen Lingdong, then asked in a low voice, \"Did you forge it again?\"\n\n\"No, this one is real. Zhao Xiaofei can testify,\" Shen Lingdong shook his head. He then seemed to recall something and asked Gu Caiwei, \"What do you mean by 'again'?\"\n\n\"Everyone at the police station knows about the letter you forged for Zheng Ying's family last time. It's just that because you had good intentions, they didn't hold you accountable. I thought you were being foolish again, forging letters for them.\" Gu Caiwei said.\n\n\"This time it's real.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you tell me? I wasn't prepared at all. What did the letter say?\" Gu Caiwei asked.\n\n\"It explained why he, a thirty-something, was idle all day, playing games,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"Hmm?\" Gu Caiwei looked puzzled.\n\nShen Lingdong then explained, \"He had a university classmate whom Gao Qing had a crush on for a long time. Once, he accidentally saw a screenshot of this game on the girl's social media. So, Gao Qing also entered the game and created a character in the girl's server. To catch up to the girl's level, he leveled up madly. One day, he finally caught up with the girl's progress, and they could team up to fight monsters. In the game, they could get married. Because they played games together often, and Gao Qing's level was relatively high, they got married in the game. However, Gao Qing never told the girl who he was, but he would intentionally or unintentionally reveal that he was also in Dongjiang City.\"\n\n\"Later, Gao Qing wanted to meet the girl, but she refused. She had known for a long time that it was Gao Qing. She said that if they could collect 13,145,200 roses in the game, they would get married in reality. These roses only dropped in specific scenes, and they could enter that scene once a week. From that day on, Gao Qing's work in the game was to clear dungeons and acquire roses. And from that day on, the girl never logged in again. A month ago, due to a version update, that dungeon was deleted.\"\n\n\"At this time, Gao Qing was only one rose short. Because the dungeon was deleted, the rose became a rare item. Gao Qing was buying roses at a high price on that server. Just then, someone contacted Gao Qing. After some bargaining, Gao Qing bought the rose for one thousand yuan. However, Gao Qing had been tricked several times before, so he proposed a face-to-face transaction, with the location chosen by the other party.\"\n\nGu Caiwei sighed softly and said, \"So that's how it was. We all thought Gao Qing was idle, but we didn't expect him to be so devoted. What about that girl?\"\n\n\"Zhao Xiaofei has already investigated that girl. She passed away from cancer four years ago.\"\n\nAlthough Gu Caiwei was a police officer, she was also a woman, and she was easily moved by such a story. She remained lost in thought for a long time.\n\nAfter a while, she came back to her senses and said to Shen Lingdong, \"Then this letter is important evidence. The person who traded with him is very suspicious.\"\n\nShen Lingdong said dismissively, \"I copied this letter. The real one has already been brought back to the police station by Zhao Xiaofei.\"\n\nAt this moment, Uncle Gao and Aunt Gao finished reading the letter and began to cry, hugging each other.\n\nGu Caiwei quickly went over to comfort them.\n\nAfter their emotions had calmed down a bit, Uncle Gao slapped his thigh and said regretfully, \"I didn't expect that… it was so important to Gao Qing. I even deleted him.\"\n\nGu Caiwei quickly said, \"Uncle Gao, I've found someone to help you restore the game.\"\n\nUncle Gao immediately looked up at Shen Lingdong and asked, \"Can it really be restored?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said to Uncle Gao, \"Gao Qing has been engrossed in games all these years, but he hasn't done nothing. The roses he collected have now become rare items. Although he bought them at a high price, selling them at the normal price would fetch at least a hundred thousand yuan. I know this is not the right time to say this, but I can help you sell them.\"\n\nUncle Gao hesitated for a moment and then said, \"The person is gone, what use is money? My son is gone. I want to see what kind of game he used to play.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"I'll help you restore it now.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nLed by Uncle Gao, Shen Lingdong and Gu Caiwei went to Gao Qing's room.\n\nIn the bedroom, there was a computer on a desk. The desktop was very messy, with many snack bags, a full ashtray, and a pile of cola bottles on the floor.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's really messy. After Gao Qing left, we haven't touched his room. At least here we can still see traces of his life.\"\n\n\"It's alright.\" Shen Lingdong carefully maneuvered around the obstacles and came to the computer.\n\nAfter turning on the computer, he checked the recycle bin. The icon for that game was quietly lying there. Shen Lingdong then restored it and opened the icon.\n\nFortunately, the game could automatically log in.\n\nUpon entering the game, a game character appeared in the center of the screen. The character's appearance was very similar to Gao Qing himself, with the nickname \"Gao Ren Yi Deng\" (Higher Than Others).\n\nAt this moment, Uncle Gao leaned closer, his eyes red, staring at the computer screen.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly stood up and offered his seat to Uncle Gao.\n\nUncle Gao sat in front of the computer screen, tried to move the mouse, and the character in the game moved accordingly.\n\nUncle Gao's eyes welled up with tears. After a moment, Uncle Gao placed his hands on his shoulders, and his two index fingers slowly tapped the keyboard, typing a message in the chat box:\n\n\"Hello everyone, I am Gao Qing's father. My son Gao Qing passed away on October 11, 2021. Thank you all for your companionship to my son during this time.\"\n\n\"As a parent, if you see this message, I hope you will pause your game for a moment and talk to your parents, even if it's just for one minute.\"\n\nThen, Uncle Gao stood up and said to Aunt Gao, \"From now on, keep this computer on. Don't turn it off.\"\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong said to Uncle Gao, \"Uncle, I'll teach you how to log in to this game. Even if the computer is always on, the game might encounter disconnections or update issues.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter leaving Gao Qing's house, Shen Lingdong drove Gu Caiwei home.\n\nOn the way, Shen Lingdong asked Gu Caiwei, \"Are you like this with every deceased's family member?\"\n\nGu Caiwei replied, \"Before I entered their homes, I was a police officer. But after I entered their homes, I treated myself as their daughter. However, not many treat me as a daughter. Like Song Ming's parents, they looked at me with impatient expressions.\"\n\n\"You've worked hard, officer,\" Shen Lingdong said to Gu Caiwei.\n\n\"You're just good with words. Give me something practical, like treating me to a meal.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then said, \"You should be treating me.\"\n\nGu Caiwei sighed softly and then said, \"How about you come to my place, and I'll cook for you?\"\n\n\"Are Uncle and Aunt at home?\" Shen Lingdong felt the same oppressive feeling he had when he first met Uncle Gao. Although they were the deceased's family, because of Gu Caiwei, it felt like meeting a father-in-law.\n\n\"Yes, they are.\"\n\n\"Then I won't go.\"\n\nGu Caiwei frowned and looked at Shen Lingdong with disdain, saying, \"Shen Lingdong, I didn't expect you to be this kind of person!\"\n\nShen Lingdong was taken aback and retorted, \"What did I do?\"\n\n\"You... you want to assault a police officer!\"\n\nShen Lingdong tilted his head slightly, looked at Gu Caiwei helplessly, and then said, \"I don't think you can cook, so I don't dare to eat it.\"\n\nGu Caiwei stared at Shen Lingdong for a few seconds, a faint smile on her face, and asked, \"Why did I feel you were a bit nervous when you saw Uncle Gao just now?\"\n\n\"Did you? How could I be nervous?\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter dropping Gu Caiwei off at home, Shen Lingdong did not go up for dinner and returned home directly.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong returned home, he took a shower and then sat down in front of the computer, downloading the game that Gao Qing used to play.\n\nAs soon as he entered the game, he saw a shocking scene. Numerous players were mourning for Gao Qing, and many players were gathered around Gao Qing's game character.\n\nThe chat channel was flooded with messages saying, \"Gao Ren Yi Deng, rest in peace.\"\n\nNot long after, Shen Lingdong suddenly saw a system message.\n\nThe official decision was to restore that dungeon and create two NPC characters, \"Gao Ren Yi Deng\" and \"Luoxia\".",

    "content": "**Chapter 96: Cleanup Completed**\n\nThe second day.\n\nAlthough Shen Lingdong had told everyone to gather at Yuhai Villa at nine o'clock, he woke up very early and drove to the intermediary company that was managing Yuhai Villa on his behalf, Yongan Intermediary.\n\nArriving at the entrance of the intermediary company, Shen Lingdong parked his car opposite. Since it was still early, the intermediary had not yet opened. Shen Lingdong stood at the entrance of the intermediary company, staring at the rental listings posted outside.\n\nIn the center, in the most conspicuous position, was the rental information for Yuhai Villa.\n\nBefore long, a group of men in suits and leather shoes entered the intermediary company one after another.\n\nJust then, a young man stood in front of Shen Lingdong and asked softly, \"Sir, are you buying or renting?\"\n\n\"I'm just looking.\"\n\n\"Okay, sir. If you need any assistance, feel free to call me.\" the young man said to Shen Lingdong with a smile.\n\nShen Lingdong had a good impression of this young man. Although it wasn't working hours, he was the only one who approached him while he was standing at the entrance. Shen Lingdong was not interested in houses, but since the young man had come to him, he decided to chat for a bit.\n\nThinking this, Shen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then said, \"I want to buy a house for a wedding. Do you have any suitable recommendations?\"\n\n\"Alright, sir. Come into the room with me. I'll check on the computer for you. What's your approximate budget, sir?\"\n\n\"Around one million.\" Shen Lingdong said as he walked into the room.\n\nThe young man arranged a seat for Shen Lingdong, poured him a glass of water, and then asked softly, \"May I have your last name, sir?\"\n\n\"My surname is Shen.\"\n\nThe young man then came over with a tablet and selected a few good properties for Shen Lingdong to review.\n\nAfter looking at a few houses, Shen Lingdong said to the young man, \"I saw the rental information for Yuhai Villa posted at the door earlier. It also handles wedding services, right?\"\n\nThe young man looked outside and then said, \"That has expired.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Shen Lingdong immediately asked.\n\n\"Some incidents happened a while ago, and Yuhai Villa is temporarily not available for rent.\"\n\n\"When will it be available for rent again?\"\n\nThe young man looked troubled and said, \"It's hard to say. Even if it becomes available for rent again, I don't think anyone will go there anymore. Besides, I'm not in charge of Yuhai Villa's business.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and asked, \"Can I speak to the person in charge?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Brother Shen. Please wait a moment.\"\n\nThe young man stood up and went to another person's workstation. \"Brother Zhao, someone wants to ask about Yuhai Villa?\"\n\nAt this moment, the person who reported the crime, Zhao Bo, looked up at Shen Lingdong, frowned slightly, then slowly stood up, came to the sofa, and said to Shen Lingdong, \"You're not here to rent a house, are you?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly, looked Zhao Bo up and down, and then said, \"Can I talk to you about Yuhai Villa?\"\n\nZhao Bo sat down on the sofa calmly and said softly, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Special Scene Cleanup Team, Shen Lingdong. The cleaning fee for this job was supposed to be paid by Wu Anguo, but I can't find him, so I have to find you.\"\n\nZhao Bo frowned slightly and then asked, \"Is the cleanup completed?\"\n\n\"Not yet. I came to confirm first. Should we contact Wu Anguo directly or you?\"\n\n\"I need to contact a Mr. Wu about this matter.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and then said, \"I noticed that Yuhai Villa is mostly empty. How did you ensure the cleanliness of the rooms before? Do you have a fixed cleaning company? With the current situation, no cleaning company will likely do the cleaning tasks. If Mr. Wu still intends to have you manage the villa's rental business, we can discuss cooperation.\"\n\n\"We already have a fixed cleaning company.\"\n\n\"Which cleaning company?\"\n\nZhao Bo smiled and said, \"I'm afraid that's confidential.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately asked, \"Did the police ask you this question?\"\n\nZhao Bo shook his head.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately said, \"Alright, I'll call the police to ask you now.\"\n\nAs Shen Lingdong said this, he took out his phone.\n\nZhao Bo quickly held Shen Lingdong's hand as he was reaching for his phone and said, \"Brother, brother, brother, please don't call the police. I've been cooperating with the police investigation every day recently, and my company's performance has hit rock bottom. It's just a small matter, I'll tell you directly, okay?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nZhao Bo then said, \"It's Anjie Housekeeping Company. I signed a three-year contract with them. When tenants entered, their company sent people to clean every day. When no one was there, they went once a week. However, on the day of the incident, due to the landslide caused by the rain, they didn't go.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked outside. The cleaning company was right across the street. \"So, they have the keys, right?\"\n\nZhao Bo quickly shook his head. \"Only I have the keys to enter the villa. There is only one key. They have to come to me to get the key every time they perform cleaning.\"\n\n\"Why is there no surveillance in such a large villa? I see traces of surveillance being installed on the walls. Why were they removed?\"\n\nZhao Bo then said, \"There was surveillance, but it was removed a year ago. However, to prevent customers from damaging the property, a high deposit is required for rentals.\"\n\n\"Aren't you afraid of outsiders damaging it?\" Shen Lingdong continued to ask.\n\nZhao Bo smiled and said, \"No one goes there at all.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed silently and then said, \"It's precisely because of this kind of thinking that a murder occurred there.\"\n\nZhao Bo did not reply.\n\nShen Lingdong continued to ask, \"When you went to Yuhai Villa, did you find any traces of other people?\"\n\n\"I've already told the police about this. I didn't see any other footprints, and it had been raining those days, so even if there were any traces, they would have been washed away by the heavy rain,\" Zhao Bo replied.\n\n\"Since there is only one road leading to Yuhai Villa, why do you know about a small path? Does anyone else know about this small path, or any other small paths?\" Shen Lingdong asked Zhao Bo several questions expressionlessly.\n\nZhao Bo shook his head. \"At that time, I hadn't been able to contact Song Ming for four days. Even if there was no road, I would have crawled there. I don't know if anyone else knows about it or if there are other small paths. The north and west sides are deep mountains, and anyone who goes in cannot get out. The river to the east also flooded due to the heavy rain. To enter Yuhai Villa, there really was only that one path.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and then asked, \"What time did you appear at the entrance of Yuhai Villa that day?\"\n\n\"I left the company at eight o'clock, and discovered the landslide around nine o'clock. Then I got out of the car and walked to Yuhai Villa. It took about half an hour to reach the entrance of Yuhai Villa. After discovering the body inside, I immediately called the police. I only saw one body in the hall and didn't know there were others upstairs.\"\n\n\"Are you sure about the time?\" Shen Lingdong stood up and said with a smile.\n\n\"The police have already asked me all these questions,\" Zhao Bo replied quickly.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then stood up and said to Zhao Bo, \"That's all for now. Sorry to have taken up your time. Perhaps I'll look for you when I buy a house in the future, and I'll also rent Yuhai Villa.\"\n\nWith that, Shen Lingdong walked outside.\n\nAfter leaving the intermediary, Shen Lingdong stood at the entrance and glanced at the housekeeping company across the street. After checking the time, he felt that he was running out of time. He immediately sent a WeChat message to Lin Xiangbei, asking him to investigate the housekeeping company.\n\nThen, Shen Lingdong got back into his car and drove towards Yuhai Villa.\n\nWhen he arrived at Yuhai Villa, it was exactly nine o'clock. Everyone else was also very punctual, including Zhao Xiaofei.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly organized everyone and began the cleanup task.\n\nHowever, after half an hour, Shen Lingdong put down his work, went to the entrance of the villa, and called Wang Jizhong out. He took a pack of Yuxi cigarettes from his car and threw it to Wang Jizhong.\n\nWang Jizhong looked at the pack of cigarettes, was slightly stunned, and then asked, \"What, trying to bribe me? Is there something you need me to do?\"\n\nAs he spoke, he opened the cigarette pack and took out a cigarette.\n\n\"Gu Caiwei stole her dad's cigarettes to help him quit, and asked me to bring them to the company for you guys to smoke, so I just gave them to you. By the way, don't let Lao Zheng see it.\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\nWang Jizhong was both surprised and delighted. He turned around, looked at Zheng Daoguang, who was cleaning in the hall through the glass of the door, and then smiled mysteriously, \"So, in your heart, my status is more important than Lao Zheng's.\"\n\nShen Lingdong said expressionlessly, \"Auntie asked me to keep an eye on Lao Zheng and not let him smoke anymore.\"\n\nWang Jizhong's smile immediately disappeared, and he said, \"Aren't you worried about me? Cough cough!\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"You're not married, are you? You can smoke as much as you want. If you die, no one will miss you.\"\n\nWang Jizhong was furious. He took two deep puffs of the cigarette, then threw the half-smoked cigarette fiercely on the ground. \"I'll quit after finishing this pack!\"\n\nWith that, he took another cigarette from the pack.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Wang Jizhong helplessly, then said, \"At that time, we saw that there were quite a few footprints here, right?\"\n\nWang Jizhong looked down at the ground and then said, \"Yes.\"\n\nShen Lingdong leaned closer to the main door, pressed against the glass, and used his hand to shield the sunlight. He looked at the people inside working enthusiastically and then said to Wang Jizhong, \"I went to see Zhao Bo today. Anjie Housekeeping did the cleaning work for the villa before. I've already asked Team Lin to investigate that housekeeping company. Also, I want to take over the subsequent cleaning work of this villa and have our cleaning company do it.\"\n\n\"There aren't many people who come here anyway, and now there's been a murder. Will anyone come in the future?\"\n\n\"I don't know. If they plan to abandon Yuhai Villa, they probably wouldn't let the cleanup team clean it. They would just let it fall into disrepair. So I guess Wu Anguo still plans to develop it.\"\n\nWang Jizhong pondered for a moment and then said, \"This place doesn't make much money. Why does Wu Anguo want to keep it?\"\n\n\"It might not be for making money. It's more likely to have the police compile a list of everyone who appeared at this villa.\"\n\n\"Is it related to the case?\" Wang Jizhong asked.\n\n\"No, I'm just curious,\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\nWang Jizhong sighed slightly and then said, \"Team Lin is quite busy lately, and if this matter goes through him, it might lead to more complications. I'll help you find a police officer from this station to investigate.\"\n\nWang Jizhong suddenly froze for a moment, then said, \"Are you implying this with this pack of cigarettes?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled.\n\n\"You kid, to keep Lin Team from knowing, you first assigned him a task so he wouldn't have time to investigate, and then you asked me to find someone for you. It gives the illusion that all the police are working for you. You little rascal, you've got some skills.\"\n\n\"Heh heh, smoke quickly, and then go back to work.\"\n\n\"You go in first. I'll finish this cigarette and make a phone call.\"\n\nShen Lingdong returned to the villa and continued the cleanup work.\n\nHowever, not long after, Zhao Xiaofei was called away by Lin Xiangbei. Shen Lingdong had included Zhao Xiaofei in his progress estimation for the day. But with him gone, the work likely wouldn't be completed today.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly sent a WeChat message to Yuan Yuan, asking her to come and help.\n\nUnexpectedly, Yuan Yuan was not feeling well today and couldn't touch cold water.\n\nAlthough others were free, their qualifications had not been reviewed, so Shen Lingdong decided against it.\n\nShen Lingdong had no choice but to work tirelessly, finally finishing all the cleanup work before dark.\n\nHe disposed of the trash, locked the doors and windows, and headed back.\n\nUpon returning to the company, Shen Lingdong felt that everyone had been working hard these past few days, so he let everyone go home directly. He stayed behind to move the equipment and tools.\n\nShen Lingdong was carrying a toolbox and was about to get his keys to open the company door when he suddenly noticed that the door was unlocked.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, became alert, and cautiously sneaked inside. He opened the main door and then turned on the lights. There was no one on the first floor. Shen Lingdong picked up a mop handle next to him and slowly walked upstairs.\n\nAfter turning on the lights on the second floor, he still didn't find anyone.\n\nShen Lingdong then approached his office and suddenly saw Gu Caiwei asleep on his desk.\n\nShen Lingdong breathed a sigh of relief, put the mop handle aside, and then quietly entered the room. He picked up a piece of clothing from the side and covered Gu Caiwei with it, then continued downstairs to move things.\n\nBefore long, Gu Caiwei, draped in Shen Lingdong's jacket, appeared at the doorway. Seeing Shen Lingdong moving things, she asked, \"When did you get back? Why didn't you wake me up?\"\n\nShen Lingdong, holding a cardboard box, replied, \"You were sleeping so soundly, I didn't want to disturb you. You're keeping watch for me like this? You wouldn't even know if a thief broke in.\"\n\n\"Is there anything worth stealing here?\" Gu Caiwei said with a smile.\n\n\"Why did you come here?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"To bring you this,\" Gu Caiwei replied, returning to the room and picking up a document from the desk. \"Didn't you want a list of everyone who appeared at Yuhai Villa? I've compiled it for you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and quickly asked, \"Did Wang Jizhong ask you to investigate?\"\n\nGu Caiwei sighed silently and then said, \"No. Isn't Zhong Hao from our class working at the Nan Cheng District Police Station? Wang Jizhong called their station chief, Director Li, and Director Li asked Zhong Hao to investigate. Zhong Hao knew I was dealing with Yuhai Villa, so he asked me for help. Later, I found out you needed it, so this team leader directly brought it to you.\"\n\nAfter a slight pause, Gu Caiwei continued, \"Of course, there's another reason: one person among these people is quite special.\"\n\nShen Lingdong took the report and glanced at it. The name of one person was specially marked by Gu Caiwei.\n\nUpon seeing that name, Shen Lingdong was slightly surprised.\n\n\"Yuan Yuan.\"",

    "content": "**Chapter 097: Simulation**\n\nFrom August 17th to August 20th, 2020, Yuan Yuan stayed at Yuhai Villa for three days.\n\nWas this a coincidence?\n\nFurthermore, when Shen Lingdong looked for Yuan Yuan at Yuhai Villa this afternoon, she had declined. Was she deliberately avoiding him?\n\nShen Lingdong couldn't help but indulge in speculation.\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei, who was beside him, slowly spoke, \"It's not that I have any hostility towards Yuan Yuan and want to falsely accuse her, but her name appearing here is indeed a bit suspicious.\"\n\nShen Lingdong slightly turned his head to look at Gu Caiwei and softly asked, \"What hostility do you have towards Yuan Yuan?\"\n\nGu Caiwei knew she had misspoke and quickly explained, \"What hostility could I have towards Yuan Yuan? I just find her a bit strange.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Shen Lingdong replied softly, then said, \"Leave this list with me for now. I'll investigate Yuan Yuan. If there really are any doubts, things that weren't discovered during her background check will be difficult for you to uncover any new tricks.\"\n\nGu Caiwei pondered for a moment, then nodded, \"That's true. Even if she's hiding something, since she works at your cleaning company, it's inevitable that some issues will be exposed over time.\"\n\nShen Lingdong agreed, \"Right, true affection develops over time?\"\n\nGu Caiwei: \"Huh?\"\n\nShen Lingdong was instantly startled and quickly explained, \"I mean, people's true hearts are revealed over time...\"\n\n\"No matter what, you need to be vigilant.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and softly replied to Gu Caiwei, \"Don't worry, I know. Since you worked so hard today, how about I treat you to dinner?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"After I finish this bit of work.\"\n\nWith that, Shen Lingdong continued to move the items until all the goods from the car were moved to the company. Afterward, he and Gu Caiwei left.\n\nAfter sending Gu Caiwei home, Shen Lingdong immediately returned to his own home. On the way, he suddenly received a WeChat message from Lin Xiangbei, asking if Shen Lingdong had time and if so, to come to the Criminal Police Detachment.\n\nLooking at the message from Lin Xiangbei, Shen Lingdong was slightly taken aback. He hadn't expected Lin Xiangbei to invite him to the Criminal Police Detachment. He quickly turned the car around and drove towards the detachment.\n\nUpon arriving at the Criminal Police Detachment, Shen Lingdong still parked his car on the road outside. However, he spent a long time looking for a parking space, which delayed him considerably.\n\nAfter meeting Lin Xiangbei, Shen Lingdong immediately apologized, saying, \"I'm sorry, Captain Lin. I'm a bit late. I spent a long time looking for a parking space outside.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's okay,\" Lin Xiangbei said softly, then picked up his phone and sent a voice message, \"Xiao Song, come to my office.\"\n\nA moment later, a female police officer appeared in Lin Xiangbei's office.\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately said to Xiao Song, \"Help Shen Lingdong with the procedures for his car. From now on, his car can be parked directly in the courtyard.\"\n\nNot only was Shen Lingdong surprised, but Xiao Song was also very surprised.\n\nAfter having Shen Lingdong fill out a form, Xiao Song went to handle the procedures.\n\nLin Xiangbei picked up a stack of documents from his desk, then said to Shen Lingdong, \"Let's go. We'll go to the conference room. I've called a few people, and we'll chat.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was still somewhat disbelieving and stood frozen, \"Me? Go to a meeting with you?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei shook his head slightly and said, \"It's not a meeting, just a simple chat.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Shen Lingdong replied, then stood up and followed behind Lin Xiangbei towards the adjacent conference room.\n\nWhen the two arrived at the conference room, a few people had already arrived. Sitting at the outermost position, closest to the door, was Zhao Xiaofei. Next to Zhao Xiaofei was Liao Jia, followed by Liang Yinxi, who looked about the same age as Captain Lin, and the technician Song Hai, whom Shen Lingdong had met a few times.\n\nOn the other side sat Wang Jizhong and Director Sun.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately greeted Director Sun, but his gaze skipped over Wang Jizhong.\n\nWhen Liao Jia saw Shen Lingdong appear, she immediately greeted him softly, \"Master.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly at Liao Jia, then looked at Zhao Xiaofei next to Liao Jia. Zhao Xiaofei was currently looking at Shen Lingdong with anger, his breathing heavy.\n\nAt this time, Song Hai also greeted Shen Lingdong, saying, \"You're here.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei said to Shen Lingdong, \"Sit anywhere. We're just going to have a casual chat about the case. Everyone should know each other already, right? Oh, Sister Xi might not know, let me introduce you. This is the beauty from the forensic department, Liang Yinxi. You can call her Sister Xi like us. Sister Xi, this is Shen Lingdong from the cleaning team.\"\n\n\"I know him.\"\n\n\"Hello, Sister Xi,\" Shen Lingdong quickly greeted Liang Yinxi and then sat down.\n\nLin Xiangbei also sat down, resting his legs on the chair next to him, looking very relaxed. He then said, \"I've gathered everyone here this time to have a casual chat about our thoughts on this case. This isn't a formal discussion; it's just a game.\"\n\n\"I have information on the seven victims in this case. Except for Director Sun, each of us will draw one. Then, based on each person's personality, we'll infer their actions in the villa. Everyone has to imagine themselves as the killer and try to 'kill' the others. Director Sun will be the host.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly stunned. Isn't this a murder mystery game?\n\nI've worked all day, and I'm not going home to sleep, but I'm running to the police station to play a game with you?\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei quickly stood up, walked over to Lin Xiangbei, picked up a few files, and came to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately drew one of the files. Without looking at it, he placed it on the table. The others also drew their respective scripts.\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at his script and said, \"I drew Song Ming. What about you all?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then looked at his script. He had drawn Lu Fei, who he currently considered the most suspicious.\n\nZhao Xiaofei drew Qiu Gao, Liao Jia drew Qi Shuang, Sister Xi drew Jing Liang, Wang Jizhong drew Gao Qing, and Song Hai drew Cao Jiazhi.\n\nDirector Sun sipped his tea, a smile on his face as he watched everyone. He then slowly said, \"Everyone, take a look at your scripts first. Remember to get into character. If this simulation of the deceased is done well, I can apply to the higher authorities to promote it across the province.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked down at his script. The introduction to Lu Fei was very detailed, including his personality and habits.\n\nHowever, there was one problem: this Lu Fei might be a fake Lu Fei. It would be quite difficult to infer the actions of a fake Lu Fei by relying on this.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, everyone had finished reading their scripts. Director Sun looked around and slowly said, \"Everyone has now arrived at Yuhai Villa. The order of arrival is Cao Jiazhi, Lu Fei, Gao Qing, Qiu Gao and Qi Shuang, Jing Liang, and Song Ming. Everyone will speak in order. Anyone can be the killer. When speaking, you need to state who you want to kill and how you intend to commit the murder, as well as a plan for escape. If you can't say it, you'll have to treat everyone to drinks.\"\n\nAt this time, Song Hai cleared his throat and slowly began, \"I am Cao Jiazhi, a teacher. I didn't intend to kill anyone. I just wanted to find a quiet place to prepare my lessons. I didn't expect to be murdered. I might be the first to die. That's all I have to say. I'm going downstairs to buy a drink.\"\n\n\"Wait, don't rush. If you just wanted to prepare your lessons, why did you come to Yuhai Villa?\" Director Sun immediately asked.\n\nSong Hai blinked his eyes and then said, \"Perhaps it was because someone invited me.\"\n\nDirector Sun then said, \"You go buy a drink downstairs first. Who arrived at the scene second?\"\n\nShen Lingdong slightly raised his arm and said, \"Lu Fei, I was the second to arrive at Yuhai Villa. I would consider killing Cao Jiazhi because, as of now, only the two of us have arrived at the scene, and I can easily kill him. Since everyone is still a stranger, I need to get acquainted with Cao Jiazhi as quickly as possible. I might even directly discuss the report against him with him. If it's just a normal chat, Cao Jiazhi might answer my questions while taking notes. If he's engrossed in his work, it would be difficult for me to stab him.\"\n\n\"However, if I say something that is enough to grab his attention, he might directly turn around and look at me. If I happen to be standing behind him, then I'll have an opportunity to commit the murder.\"\n\nDirector Sun pondered for a moment and slowly nodded.\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei suddenly asked, \"Have you considered the time the third person arrived at Yuhai Villa, and whether Lu Fei would have had time to deal with any bloodstains on himself?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly and then said, \"What if I didn't commit the murder as Lu Fei?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned slightly and then asked, \"Then what identity would you use?\"\n\n\"As a cleaner. I'd be wearing gloves and carrying a mop. This attire would easily make people lower their guard. Since I was standing behind Cao Jiazhi, I wouldn't worry about blood getting on myself, as long as I protected my hands. After committing the murder, I could return to my room and take off my gloves.\"\n\nAt this time, Sister Xi spoke up, \"From the autopsy, the wounds on Cao Jiazhi's body were indeed inflicted from behind by the killer.\"\n\n\"What was the motive?\" Lin Xiangbei suddenly asked.\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and then said, \"This case is precisely lacking a motive. If the motive were known, this case would definitely not have dragged on until now. If I have to come up with a motive, I believe there are two possibilities: first, a hired murder; second, extralegal punishment.\"\n\n\"Hired murder? Extralegal punishment? That can't be right. I heard that Teacher Cao has a good reputation among his students. Even if he was reported for corporal punishment, it was a misunderstanding,\" Director Sun said slowly.\n\nShen Lingdong shrugged, indicating that he didn't know anything further.\n\nLin Xiangbei pondered for a moment, then picked up his pen and began writing on the paper.\n\nDirector Sun nodded, then looked at Wang Jizhong and softly said, \"Brother Wang, it's your turn next.\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded, hesitated for a moment, then said to everyone, \"I am a middle-aged man addicted to the internet. My purpose here is very simple: I'm here to trade a certain game item. However, I guess the first thing I'd do after arriving at the villa is charge my phone. But when I find there's no power in the room, I might ask others, like Lu Fei, or go downstairs to check the reason. When I find that the vending machine is working normally, I might try to find an outlet behind it, until the next person arrives. So I think Cao Jiazhi and Gao Qing are not the killers.\"\n\nAt this time, Liao Jia slowly opened her mouth and said, \"Qiu Gao and I arrived at Yuhai Villa together. I was carrying a large suitcase. If I were the killer, I would first go upstairs to observe the situation in the villa, then find an opportunity to call everyone downstairs. Afterward, I would use the excuse of changing clothes to go upstairs. At this time, I would go to the third floor. As the only female, I would naturally make people lower their guard. This way, I would have the opportunity to approach Cao Jiazhi. Even if my clothes were stained with blood, I could change them legitimately.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei spoke up, \"But we investigated the video before she left home, and there were no bloodstains on the clothes she was wearing.\"\n\nLiao Jia lowered her head and thought for a long time.\n\nAt this time, Director Sun said, \"Get ready to buy drinks.\"\n\nLiao Jia suddenly looked up, her eyes wide, and looked at everyone. She lowered her voice and slowly said, \"What if I brought two identical sets of clothes?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei next to her was startled by this look and quickly exclaimed, \"You scared me.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei mulled over Liao Jia's words, then made a note of this clue. He then looked up at Zhao Xiaofei and said, \"It's your turn.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei took a deep breath and then said, \"I am Qiu Gao, a self-media personality. I like to post controversial topics online. Among everyone, I am the only one who knows Qi Shuang. Because I like Liao Jia, I will help her with her luggage, so my fingerprints were left on the suitcase...\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Shen Lingdong suddenly called out to stop him.\n\nEveryone turned their attention to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong then slowly said, \"Talk about the case, don't bring personal emotions into it. In the first sentence you were talking about Qi Shuang, and in the next, you changed to Liao Jia. You're trying to confess, aren't you?\"\n\nHearing Shen Lingdong say this, everyone suddenly realized. Liao Jia's character was indeed Qi Shuang. When Zhao Xiaofei mentioned Liao Jia, he naturally treated her as Qi Shuang, and Qiu Gao did like Qi Shuang. But no one expected Zhao Xiaofei to take the opportunity to confess.\n\nThe others immediately started to make a fuss, and even Director Sun couldn't help but laugh.\n\nLiao Jia looked at Zhao Xiaofei with anger and then said, \"Hurry up and talk about the case.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei pursed his lips and said to Liao Jia, \"It's okay, we're playing a game. I want to know what you're feeling right now and if you have any response.\"\n\nLiao Jia quickly put her arm around Sister Xi's arm and said coquettishly, \"Sister Xi, Captain Lin is bullying me.\"\n\nSister Xi smiled and said, \"As expected, when men get gossipy, there's no room for women. However, I also think you should make your stance clear.\"\n\n\"Sister Xi, you...\" Liao Jia looked at Liang Yinxi with a wronged expression, then suddenly turned her head, raised her fist, and hit Zhao Xiaofei, \"What are you talking nonsense about?\"",

    "content": "After Shen Lingdong left the police station and returned home, he sat on his bed, lost in thought as he looked at the friend request information on his phone.\n\nGu Caiwei was truly persistent. She had sent several more friend request messages throughout the night. After a moment of contemplation, Shen Lingdong accepted Gu Caiwei's friend request.\n\n\"You finally accepted.\"\n\n\"Mhm.\" Shen Lingdong only replied with one word, but his fingers hovered over the keyboard, as if he wanted to say more. Just as he typed a few characters, Gu Caiwei sent another message.\n\n\"Still the same, still so quiet.\"\n\nShen Lingdong deleted the few characters he had just typed and began anew, \"I heard you're at the Municipal Archives Bureau?\"\n\n\"Yes, you must have heard from Zhao Xiaofei. That's great, finally some news about you. We've had a few class reunions, but you were always missing.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stared at the screen for a long time before slowly replying, \"We're not the same anymore.\"\n\n\"What's different? Several of our classmates didn't become police officers after graduation, but we're still classmates.\"\n\n\"I won't be going there in the future either. Actually, you should know why I added you as a friend,\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\n\"Is it about your father's case?\" Gu Caiwei asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGu Caiwei remained silent. Shen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and added, \"But I don't want you to violate regulations.\"\n\n\"All I can tell you now is that your father's case was classified as not for public disclosure due to its severe impact.\"\n\n\"A serial murder case?\" Shen Lingdong countered.\n\n\"Let's talk about something else. I'll send you a photo to look at.\"\n\nA moment later, Gu Caiwei sent a graduation photo of their class. All the classmates were there, except for Shen Lingdong. Shen Lingdong didn't reply.\n\nGu Caiwei continued, \"See where I am?\"\n\nShen Lingdong searched for Gu Caiwei in the photo and quickly found her in the center. Beside her was Zhao Xiaofei, with only half a person's width between them.\n\n\"You really suit the center position.\"\n\n\"Look next to me, that space was intentionally left for you. In my heart, you've always been with us.\"\n\n\"That's kind of creepy. If people didn't know, they'd think I was already dead.\" Shen Lingdong, uncharacteristically, added an emoji at the end of this sentence.\n\n\"I'm so honored that Sherlock Dong would type so much. You must be exhausted,\" Gu Caiwei added a playful emoji.\n\n\"It's okay, not tired.\"\n\n\"When I call you fat, you start puffing yourself up.\"\n\n\"Why did you go to the Municipal Archives Bureau?\" Shen Lingdong remembered Gu Caiwei saying when they were in school that she wanted to be a criminal investigator, and even a female captain of the criminal investigation team.\n\n\"It's more relaxed, and not tiring.\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound like you.\"\n\n\"Then tell me, why would I go to the Municipal Archives Bureau?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'm getting tired, you should rest early.\"\n\n\"Okay, goodnight.\"\n\nShen Lingdong didn't even look at Gu Caiwei's last message before lying down on his bed and staring blankly at the ceiling. He hadn't gotten any leads on his father's case from Gu Caiwei.\n\nCurrently, all he knew was that salt had appeared in his father's case. Was it a coincidence, or was there another perpetrator who had committed the crime again? Using this method to commit murder, the killer must have some knowledge of Feng Shui. Perhaps he could start with Zheng Daoguang and follow the clues.\n\nAs for Zheng Ying's case, apart from the neat arrangement of the body, which might be a sign of serial killings, Shen Lingdong thought of another possibility. \"Compliance.\" When he was doing housekeeping with those aunts before, they would occasionally talk about their grandchildren or grandsons. To help the babies develop good sleeping habits, their bodies would be placed neatly when they slept. Sometimes, they would specifically have them sleep on their left or right side. The latter was to give the baby a nice head shape. But ultimately, as long as the baby was asleep, they would allow their parents to position them.\n\nCombined with the fact that the waitress at the murder mystery game store mentioned the middle-aged woman referring to Zheng Ying as her daughter, the killer might have been making Zheng Ying comply with her wishes. Zheng Ying had run away from home because of her rebelliousness. Looking at it this way, the killer clearly wanted to control Zheng Ying, but after discovering Zheng Ying's rebellious behavior, the killer decided to kill her.\n\nAt this moment, the image of Aunt Zheng appeared in Shen Lingdong's mind. She really wanted her daughter to obey her, and her husband understood Feng Shui, which fit the perpetrator's profile. Was the middle-aged woman the waitress saw really Aunt Zheng? However, when Shen Lingdong saw Aunt Zheng today, she clearly didn't know what Zheng Ying did on the computer all day. Instead, the middle-aged woman who accompanied Zheng Ying to and from the murder mystery game store not only knew what Zheng Ying was doing but was also very proud of it. If Aunt Zheng and Zheng Ying had gone to the murder mystery game store together, it would mean they had reconciled. Therefore, the possibility of Aunt Zheng being the perpetrator was not very high. It now seemed likely that the middle-aged woman was the killer, either having no children or having lost her children at a very young age, which had caused her psychological trauma.\n\nJust then, Shen Lingdong's phone suddenly rang. Thinking it was Gu Caiwei, he didn't intend to reply. However, upon seeing a strange profile picture on the notification bar, Shen Lingdong opened his phone. It was the waitress from the evening.\n\n\"I'm off work, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"Sleeping.\" Shen Lingdong glanced at the time; it was already 9:30 PM.\n\n\"Aren't you going to ask me why I'm working so late?\" the other party asked.\n\n\"Because the mall closes at this time.\"\n\n\"You know that? You're really amazing. I found a really good snack stall on the street, do you want to try it?\"\n\n\"What did the police ask you?\"\n\n\"Just what I told you. And they also asked me to describe the woman's general appearance. They used some software to create a facial composite, but it's been too long, I really can't remember.\"\n\n\"Did they ask you about the woman's features?\"\n\n\"Yes. I only remember one thing: she gesticulated a lot when she spoke.\"\n\n\"Were those gestures touching certain areas, or just moving in the air?\"\n\n\"Moving in the air. All her jewelry on her wrists was visible. Afterwards, I even told my colleagues that she was showing off her jewelry.\"\n\n\"Showing off might be one aspect, but on the other hand, it indicates she was using hand gestures to emphasize the logical points when she spoke. For people like that, what they say when their hands are moving is the key. For example, when you say 'yes, yes, yes,' you usually point with your finger, which is to emphasize.\"\n\n\"There's such a thing?\"\n\n\"If you think of any other details, let me know.\"\n\n\"I have one more question, what's your name?\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed silently, tossed his phone aside, and closed his eyes to sleep. He was too lazy to answer such a meaningless question.",

    "content": "Chapter 99: Fingerprint Data\n\nShen Lingdong returned home drunk.\n\nAs soon as he opened the door, he saw his mother, Li Xianglan, in a panic as she tidied up items on the table.\n\nLi Xianglan looked nervously at Shen Lingdong, quickly hiding the item in her hand under the table.\n\n\"What are you writing?\" Shen Lingdong asked, full of confusion.\n\n\"N-nothing?\"\n\n\"Mom, your state is just like when I was a kid and caught secretly writing my diary,\" Shen Lingdong said with a smile. He then went to the bathroom to wash his face, trying to sober up quickly.\n\nLi Xianglan's heart tightened, and she quickly stood up, grabbed the notebook in her hand, and hurried back into her room.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong came out of the bathroom, he glanced at the clock on the wall. It was already midnight. He then asked Li Xianglan, \"Why aren't you asleep yet? Staying up late is bad for your health.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm going to sleep now.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at his mother's retreating back and felt something was off. He then asked, \"Mom, you weren't really writing in a diary just now, were you?\"\n\n\"It's not exactly a diary. It's mainly about you. Your dad doesn't know what you're up to in prison, so I write everything down. I let your dad read it periodically to see what you've been doing lately.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Shen Lingdong responded softly and casually asked, \"How long have you been writing it?\"\n\n\"Since the day your dad went to prison. If you want to see it, I can give it to you.\"\n\n\"No thanks, I'm not interested.\" A moment later, Shen Lingdong added, \"I drank too much today. I'll look at it another time if I have the chance.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Li Xianglan replied softly.\n\nAlthough it was a diary, Shen Chaonan would also write a few words at the end after reading it. Li Xianglan hoped that through this diary, Shen Lingdong's relationship with Shen Chaonan would ease somewhat.\n\nRegardless of what either of them was thinking, the prerequisite for breaking down the barrier was communication. Without communication, some things would never be resolved.\n\nShen Lingdong poured a glass of water and sat on the sofa.\n\nAt this moment, Li Xianglan also came over and said, \"Son, don't wear yourself out so much. Your dad made a mistake, and we have to accept the punishment. No matter what people outside say about him being a murderer, your dad hasn't done anything wrong to you, to me, or to this family. You can't resent him for that alone.\"\n\nShen Lingdong turned his head slightly to look at Li Xianglan and then said softly, \"I know what to do.\"\n\nLi Xianglan sighed and continued, \"Perhaps our family of three will never be reunited in this life. But spiritually, I hope we are united as a family. Look at us now, what kind of family does this look like...\"\n\n\"You've worked hard, Mom. I know you've done a lot,\" Shen Lingdong said, placing the glass on the coffee table and gently massaging Li Xianglan's shoulders.\n\n\"I have one more wish, and that is for you to find a girlfriend quickly...\"\n\nShen Lingdong's hands stopped moving, and he leaned back on the sofa. \"Can't you just chat normally? Why do you always bring up these useless things?\"\n\n\"Alright, you should get some rest. I'm going to sleep too.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and sat in the living room for a while longer before standing up, showering, and going to bed.\n\nThe next day.\n\nAt nine o'clock, Shen Lingdong arrived at the company.\n\nAs soon as he entered the office, he saw Yuan Yuan typing furiously on her keyboard.\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly and then leaned in, asking, \"Are you chatting or writing?\"\n\nYuan Yuan then switched her computer back to the desktop and smiled at Shen Lingdong, saying, \"I'm not showing you.\"\n\n\"Then you must be writing. Can you get in the mood to create in this environment?\" Shen Lingdong glanced around at the others who were still chatting nearby.\n\n\"It's okay.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Impressive. I can't do that. The environment has a lot to do with my inspiration when I write something.\"\n\nYuan Yuan then asked, \"Do you write too?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head and said, \"If I were to write, I'd need to be locked up in prison to have the passion for creation.\"\n\n\"That's a bit exaggerated, but the environment can indeed provide inspiration for creation.\"\n\n\"I saw someone online a couple of days ago writing about tomb raiding and getting caught. I heard that everything they wrote was based on real people and real events. Is that true?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"It's true,\" Yuan Yuan nodded.\n\n\"How about we go to Yuhai Villa and do another live stream? Maybe that environment will help you with your writing,\" Shen Lingdong said to Yuan Yuan.\n\n\"No way. Never mind the murder that happened there, even without the murder, it's pretty scary.\"\n\nShen Lingdong's expression immediately showed a hint of confusion, and he then asked, \"Have you been there?\"\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong's gaze also turned to Yuan Yuan.\n\nYuan Yuan nodded and then said, \"We had a team-building event there before at the script-killing store. Playing script-killing in a place like that gives you an incredible sense of immersion.\"\n\n\"You went with the company? If you had told us earlier, we might have avoided a lot of detours,\" Shen Lingdong said, glancing at Wang Jizhong.\n\n\"I didn't know,\" Yuan Yuan quickly explained.\n\n\"Oh,\" Shen Lingdong recalled briefly and remembered that the cleanup task at the villa was directly assigned to him by Zhao Xiaofei, not relayed through Yuan Yuan. \"Alright, you can continue writing.\"\n\n\"I'm going upstairs for a while,\" Shen Lingdong said, heading upstairs to his office.\n\nNot long after, Wang Jizhong also appeared in Shen Lingdong's office. After closing the door and ensuring that their conversation couldn't be heard from outside, he asked Shen Lingdong with a serious expression, \"Yuan Yuan has also been to Yuhai Villa before?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded. \"However, we still need to investigate her former script-killing store. We need to inquire in detail about how many days they had team-building. It wasn't convenient to ask for too much detail downstairs just now.\"\n\nWang Jizhong lit a cigarette, the cigarette dangling from his lips, and said to Shen Lingdong, \"Is this a simple coincidence, or is there a hidden agenda? How did you recruit him to this company back then?\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed softly and pondered for a moment before saying, \"Her joining the company situation... is as suspicious as yours.\"\n\n\"Then it must be a hidden agenda.\"\n\nShen Lingdong snorted. \"Good. So you admit you had a hidden agenda. Back then, my company only had a few people, and two of them didn't have good intentions... Do you know how difficult it was for me then?\"\n\n\"How can my situation be the same as hers? Forget it, I'll investigate this matter. Also, there's another thing. What do you think of the fingerprint data the police provided you yesterday?\" Wang Jizhong looked at Shen Lingdong with expectant eyes.\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head and said, \"Zhao Xiaofei was still immersed in the pain of heartbreak yesterday. He'll give me the fingerprint data in a while.\"\n\nWang Jizhong glanced at his watch and said, \"He should be here around noon. I won't wait for him then. I'll go to that script-killing store first.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nWang Jizhong extinguished his cigarette butt, saw a potted banana tree on the floor, and then pressed the cigarette butt into the soil before leaving the room.\n\nShen Lingdong stared at the flowerpot, slightly stunned, and then stepped forward to examine it.\n\nHe didn't even know when a potted banana tree had appeared in the room. There was a tag hanging from it that read \"No Green Anxiety\"¹.\n\nThe flowerpot was exquisitely crafted and pink, looking quite cute. It was unlikely his mother had placed it there. So who did?\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Shen Lingdong decided to take a photo and ask. Before taking the photo, he cleaned the cigarette butt from the pot and wiped the soil from the edge of the pot with a wet wipe.\n\nShen Lingdong sent the photo to Gu Caiwei and asked, \"Did you bring this pot of flowers yesterday?\"\n\nA moment later, Gu Caiwei replied to Shen Lingdong, \"How is it? Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Why did you send me this?\"\n\n\"It's pink and tender, and I think it suits you. I smelled smoke in your office last time I visited. It must have been Old Wang smoking in your office. So, I brought you a potted banana tree yesterday to absorb the secondhand smoke in the room.\"\n\n\"It's very likely that it won't survive a week here,\" Shen Lingdong replied.\n\n\"If that flower dies, you're as good as dead.\"\n\n\"As a police officer, you're openly threatening me, an ordinary citizen? Work properly and don't play on your phone during work hours.\"\n\n\"I... Didn't you start the conversation?\"\n\nShen Lingdong retrieved a spray bottle from the downstairs storage room and began to water the potted banana tree. He also took tissues and wiped each leaf of the plant, ensuring it was spotless. If it weren't for his concern that disinfectant might damage the chlorophyll in the plant, he would have even disinfected the flower.\n\nJust then, Zhao Xiaofei suddenly pushed the door open and walked in. Seeing Shen Lingdong cleaning the dust off the banana leaves, he said, \"Oh, that's enough. If you keep wiping it, you'll rub the leaves raw. Oh, that pink pot is quite unique. I didn't expect you to like girlish pink.\"\n\n\"Gu Caiwei brought it over.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at Zhao Xiaofei. He seemed to be in good spirits today.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhao Xiaofei replied softly and then threw the fingerprint data report onto Shen Lingdong's desk. He then said to Shen Lingdong, \"When will there be a conclusion about you and Gu Caiwei?\"\n\n\"What's there to conclude about me and Gu Caiwei?\" Shen Lingdong retorted.\n\n\"The whole world knows about you two, yet you're still playing dumb. Liao Jia and I are completely finished. She didn't even speak to me today.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. Judging by Liao Jia's tone yesterday, she seemed to be a bit sulky. Persist a little longer. In school, you gave up halfway through chasing her and chased someone else. Now you're chasing her again, and she's bound to test you. If you give up now, won't the situation be the same as in school?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei stroked his chin and pondered, nodding. \"That makes sense. So what do I do if she's ignoring me now?\"\n\n\"You two work together, so there will be opportunities for contact. Liao Jia won't let your issues affect her work.\"\n\n\"Then I'll try.\"\n\nSaying that, Zhao Xiaofei turned to leave. As he reached the doorway, he stopped and looked back at Shen Lingdong, asking, \"That's not right. Wasn't I talking about you and Gu Caiwei?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and said, \"You asked me two questions at once, so you gave me the option to choose. Naturally, I avoided the question about me and shifted the focus. You should also avoid such questions when asking me.\"\n\n\"Alright, I've been taught a lesson by an old classmate.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and then said, \"It's two lessons. I still haven't answered your question. This is called changing the subject, so don't get sidetracked until you get a definite answer to your question.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei frowned and said, \"You use what the same teacher taught you so well.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed softly and casually said, \"I always encounter some troublesome employers.\"\n\n\"Indeed, society is the best teacher. I won't ask about you and Gu Caiwei anymore, but I'll remind you of one thing: Gu Caiwei has waited for you for so many years. If you two don't end up together in the end, I'll definitely beat you up.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly and then said, \"I already told you the reason when we were drinking yesterday.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei scratched his head, looking confused. \"Did... did you tell me? I don't remember.\"\n\n\"That's because you were drunk.\"\n\n\"Then tell me again?\" Zhao Xiaofei leaned in front of Shen Lingdong with a mischievous grin.\n\n\"Perhaps you should just get out.\"\n\n\"Dangerous, Shen Lingdong, you've gotten arrogant. You don't even take me, a police officer, seriously anymore. You dare to curse at a police officer.\"\n\n\"I added the word 'please.' This is considered civilized swearing on my part.\"\n\n\"I can't be bothered to argue with you. I'm leaving.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter Zhao Xiaofei left the room, Shen Lingdong picked up the report Zhao Xiaofei left on the desk and began to read it.\n\nA total of 258 fingerprints were found on the police's mobile phone.\n\nAmong them, Qi Shuang had 78, Qiu Gao had 43, Gao Qing had 25, Jing Liang had 38, Song Ming had 51, Cao Jiazhi had 14, and Lu Fei had 9.\n\nSeeing this data, Shen Lingdong couldn't help but frown. Lu Fei's fingerprints were too few. Even Cao Jiazhi, who had the shortest survival time, had three more than him.\n\nCao Jiazhi's fingerprints were found in room 303, with five instances: two on the door handle, one on the windowsill, and two on the bedside table. There was also one on the side of the door frame of room 304, one on the vending machine pickup port near the first-floor stairs, five in the study, one at the front desk, and one on the main door.\n\nAt this moment, the image of Cao Jiazhi appeared in Shen Lingdong's mind.\n\n[He opened the gate of the villa and found it ajar. He then opened the door and walked in. He glanced at the room distribution inside the villa at the front desk, then went upstairs using the stairs on the left, and bought a drink from the vending machine along the way. He then arrived on the third floor, saw someone in room 304, and greeted them at the doorway.]\n\n[Then, he returned to his own room. The room looked quite good. He stood by the window and looked outside, casually touching the windowsill to check for dust. Seeing that the room was relatively clean, he then put down his backpack and started organizing his belongings.]\n\n[At this moment, Song Ming came to his room and told him that he needed to leave for a while.]\n\n[Cao Jiazhi rested for a while, then took his books and pen to the study on the third floor. He glanced at the bookshelves in the room and then began writing his lesson preparation notes.]\n\n[Until the murderer walked into the room...]\n\n¹ \"禁止蕉綠\" (Jìnzhǐ jiāo lǜ) is a pun. \"蕉\" (jiāo) means banana, and \"焦慮\" (jiāo lǜ) means anxiety. The phrase literally translates to \"No banana anxiety,\" playing on the word for banana.",

    "content": "Chapter 100: Grafting Flowers and Changing the Moon\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Cao Jiazhi's fingerprint information. According to his guess, Song Ming had already arrived at Jade Sea Villa before Cao Jiazhi. Therefore, when Cao Jiazhi greeted Song Ming, he left his fingerprints on the door frame of Song Ming's room.\n\nAnother suspicious spot was Cao Jiazhi's fingerprints found on the dispensing slot of the vending machine, but no fingerprints were found on the corresponding beverage bottle. Why was that? If the killer cleaned the scene, why would they take away an unremarkable beverage bottle? What secret was hidden on that drink?\n\nWith this thought, Shen Lingdong took out his notebook from the drawer and recorded his speculations. Afterward, Shen Lingdong went to the warehouse downstairs, took a double-page spread of paper, and drew a rough layout of the villa from memory. Then, he marked each person's fingerprints with different colored pens. If he connected each point with lines, it would show their approximate activity trajectories.\n\nAmong the remaining people, everyone's activity areas were the first-floor lobby, reception, restaurant, kitchen, vending machine, stair railings, room door guardrails, entertainment hall, and their own rooms. Only Lu Fei's fingerprints were evenly distributed, with three fingerprints found on each floor. The fingerprints in the second-floor rooms all came from his room. The remaining fingerprints were from the third-floor railings and the restaurant. Compared to others, Lu Fei's fingerprints were too few, strangely so. Moreover, other people's fingerprints were incomplete in places, but Lu Fei's fingerprints were very complete.\n\nFrom the activity trajectories, there were no Lu Fei fingerprints in the entertainment room, indicating that the real Lu Fei had already died at that time. However, it could not be determined at this time whether Lu Fei's body had appeared in the kitchen, but it was certain that the fake Lu Fei was still in the villa, he just hadn't participated in the activities held by the others in the activity room. So, what activity were they engaged in?\n\nShen Lingdong printed out photos of several people and pasted them on the whiteboard. Looking at the information of these people, among the information he currently had, only Gao Qing's purpose was clear: he went to Jade Sea Villa for offline game item transactions. The purposes of the others were temporarily unknown. If each person came here with their own purpose and they met by chance, it could be understood. However, these people knew each other online, and they had no connections in real life, which was somewhat difficult to understand.\n\nAfter a slight hesitation, Shen Lingdong sent a WeChat message to Zhao Xiaofei, asking, \"Can you send me their respective chat records?\"\n\n\"I'll ask Captain Lin,\" Zhao Xiaofei replied.\n\nA moment later, Zhao Xiaofei sent the chat screenshots to Shen Lingdong's phone. \"These are chat screenshots taken from Song Ming's phone,\" Zhao Xiaofei added.\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the screenshots. It was a WeChat group chat. This chat group was created half a year ago. The last message was sent by Song Ming, which was the location of Jade Sea Villa. Since then, no one had spoken in that group. The chat content did not indicate why they had come to this villa. It was possible that important information had been deleted, and he didn't know.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately sent another message to Zhao Xiaofei, asking, \"Are there chat records from only Song Ming? What about the others?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei replied, \"They are all in the same group. Isn't the chat content the same?\"\n\n\"Send them over,\" Shen Lingdong replied.\n\nA moment later, Zhao Xiaofei sent the chat records of the other people. Shen Lingdong checked them and found that apart from the different angles of the screenshots from the device owner, the chat content was exactly the same. After looking for a long time, he found nothing unusual. The chats were ordinary, from initial greetings to daily life conversations, covering a wide range of topics, including astronomy, geography, military affairs, livelihood, politics, and entertainment. Some even seemed nonsensical. If some chat content had not been deleted, then these chat contents might be some kind of code.\n\nShen Lingdong tried to decipher some of them, but after studying them for a long time, he couldn't figure anything out, so he had to give up for the time being. He sighed silently and leaned back in his chair. After a long while, he picked up his phone and casually browsed through their chat records, comparing the earliest chat records from each person. Suddenly, Shen Lingdong sat up straight and carefully looked at their chat records. He discovered a slight anomaly.\n\nSong Ming's message was sent on April 4, 2021, at 16:43. However, on Lu Fei, Qiu Gao, and Gao Qing's phones, the same time was displayed. But on Qi Shuang, Jing Liang, and Cao Jiazhi's phones, it displayed 16:44. Shen Lingdong quickly transferred each chat record to the computer and lined them up on the desktop. After comparing them one by one, Shen Lingdong found 143 instances of time discrepancies. The sending times of the remaining chat content were the same.\n\nShen Lingdong pondered for a moment, marked all the problematic parts, put them into a USB drive, and then drove to the police station. As usual, Shen Lingdong prepared to park his car across the street. Just then, a police officer at the entrance called out to Shen Lingdong, \"Shen Lingdong, park in the yard.\" Shen Lingdong suddenly remembered that he had completed the procedures and turned the car around, parking it in the yard.\n\nAs soon as he entered the police station, Shen Lingdong ran into Gu Caiwei. Gu Caiwei looked at Shen Lingdong in surprise and asked, \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"I'm here to challenge your Captain Lin.\"\n\nGu Caiwei frowned and asked, \"What's going on?\"\n\nShen Lingdong walked directly towards Lin Xiangbei's office upstairs. Gu Caiwei didn't know what had happened, but seeing Shen Lingdong's serious expression, she thought something big had happened and quickly followed him.\n\nOn his way, Shen Lingdong had asked Zhao Xiaofei who was the best at playing Chinese Chess in their police station. Zhao Xiaofei told Shen Lingdong that their Captain Lin was very skilled at chess and had won the first \"Hope Children's Cup Chinese Chess Competition\" championship. Even now, he could sweep the entire police station.\n\nArriving at Lin Xiangbei's office, Shen Lingdong knocked on the door and then said to Lin Xiangbei inside, \"Come, let's play a game of Chinese Chess.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Lin Xiangbei looked at Shen Lingdong blankly, thinking he had misheard.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately said, \"I heard you're the Chess King of the Criminal Investigation Team. I specifically came to challenge you.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Lin Xiangbei responded dazedly and continued, \"Let's do it when I have time.\"\n\n\"Now,\" Shen Lingdong continued.\n\n\"Don't fool around. I'm busy,\" Lin Xiangbei said with a smile, continuing with his work.\n\n\"This is also for solving the case.\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei came next to Shen Lingdong. Hearing that he wanted to play Chinese Chess with Captain Lin, she quickly pulled Shen Lingdong aside and said, \"Shen Lingdong, stop fooling around.\"\n\nShen Lingdong said to Gu Caiwei, \"This is serious business. Ten minutes, just ten minutes.\"\n\nAt this point, Lin Xiangbei closed the file in his hands and said, \"Then wait for me for half an hour. It's almost time for lunch break. Wait for me in the lounge.\"\n\n\"Can we use the conference room? I need to use the conference room screen.\"\n\n\"Okay, since you're so confident, let's add some stakes.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Shen Lingdong nodded. With that, he turned and left.\n\nGu Caiwei said to Shen Lingdong's retreating back, \"I have other things to do, so I won't accompany you. You can eat lunch at the police station. I'll bring you some food from the cafeteria.\"\n\n\"No need, it probably won't be enough time to eat.\"\n\n...\n\nHalf an hour later, Lin Xiangbei arrived at the conference room holding a Chinese Chess set, with several team members following behind him. Since it was their lunch break, they were eager to witness Shen Lingdong's chess skills. However, Lin Xiangbei sent them away, so they could only peer through the window to watch. Lin Xiangbei intended to let Shen Lingdong go first, but he refused.\n\nAfter setting up the chessboard, Lin Xiangbei immediately used the \"cross-the-river cannon\" opening. He then began to lay down a confusing formation. He remained focused on the chessboard, while Shen Lingdong seemed much more relaxed, playing on his phone while playing chess with Lin Xiangbei. He never took more than ten seconds for each move on the board. Lin Xiangbei's play was fierce, and he indeed gained the upper hand at the beginning.\n\nDirector Sun heard that Lin Xiangbei and Shen Lingdong were playing chess and came to watch. Unknowingly, Lin Xiangbei had fallen into Shen Lingdong's trap. After a period of stalemate, he was helpless and checkmated by Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"You win.\"\n\nShen Lingdong said expressionlessly, \"I cheated.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned. Shen Lingdong quickly showed his phone to Lin Xiangbei. \"I followed your moves and played against a master-level computer opponent. On this chessboard, my moves were the steps taken by that computer player on the phone.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei took the phone and looked at it, then smiled helplessly. Shen Lingdong then said, \"I reviewed their chat records today and found a problem. I was worried I couldn't explain it clearly, so I used this method to demonstrate. But I figured it out while playing chess just now.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei waved to the police officers outside, letting them in. Shen Lingdong also took the USB drive out of his pocket and said to Song Hai, \"Put the contents here on the big screen.\" Song Hai took the USB drive and ran to the computer. As the comparison of the chat records of several people was displayed on the big screen, Shen Lingdong continued, \"The chat records of several people are the same, but the displayed time for each person has a deviation. The killer precisely used this method, grafting flowers and changing the moon.\"\n\n\"The killer registered several WeChat accounts and changed them to the same nicknames and avatars as the deceased, possibly even modifying the WeChat numbers to be similar. In each chat group, only the deceased person is real, and the others are impersonated by the killer. The chat method is similar to the method I used in playing chess, but it's more complex. Chess involves two people, but this involves seven people.\"\n\n\"For example, on Song Ming's phone, in that chat group, only Song Ming is real, and the other six are all impersonated by the killer. And on Lu Fei's phone, only Lu Fei is his own real account, and the other accounts are also fake, including the fake Song Ming.\"\n\n\"Once Song Ming speaks in the chat group, the account impersonating Song Ming will also post the same message on Lu Fei's phone. The operation method for others is the same. In the beginning, perhaps because the operation was not very skillful, the time difference would be very large. So, at the beginning of the chat records, time deviations occurred frequently. But as time went on, the operation became more skillful, and the frequency of time deviations became smaller. Occasional time deviations might be sent in the 59th second, and when transferred to other chat groups, it would definitely jump to the next minute.\"\n\n\"This is why the deceased had no connection in the real world, but they knew each other online. And online, their only connection was the killer. Of course, the content about how the killer incited them to go to Jade Sea Villa has likely been deleted.\"\n\n\"The deceased have no connections, but the killer does. I don't currently know if others have offended anyone, but it appears that most of the deceased had conflicts with people before their deaths. I boldly guess that there are seven suspects in the Jade Sea Villa murder case. Each person is responsible for one account, leading them to Jade Sea Villa. They cooperated inside and outside the villa to kill the seven deceased and fake it as the fate of the 'Blizzard' Villa.\"\n\n\"The real killer did all this to make the police believe that the killer had committed suicide out of guilt.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei quickly stood up, pointed at Shen Lingdong, and said, \"You indeed won. Although we didn't agree on what the bet was, I will give you a satisfactory stake.\" With that, Lin Xiangbei walked out, giving instructions to his team members for their respective investigation tasks.\n\nAt this time, Director Sun slowly walked into the conference room, went to the computer, unplugged the USB drive from the computer, and handed it to Shen Lingdong. Then he said, \"Young man, you're good. You noticed things that we usually overlook. Even that Xie Yingxiong spoke highly of you. I heard your company still has normal cleaning services, right? This weekend, come to my house and help me with some cleaning. I also have something I want to talk to you about. Here's my phone number. 186****5620.\"\n\n\"Okay, Director Sun,\" Shen Lingdong said with a slight smile and took out his phone to save Director Sun's number.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong's stomach suddenly rumbled. Director Sun glanced at the time and said, \"Oh dear, it's getting late. You haven't eaten yet, have you? Here's my meal card. Let's see how the food in our cafeteria tastes.\" Director Sun took out a card from his pocket and forced it into Shen Lingdong's hand before leaving the conference room.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then walked outside. Just as he reached the doorway, he saw Gu Caiwei walking over from not far away, holding a pink lunch box in her hand.",

    "content": "Chapter 101: Citywide Manhunt\n\nShen Lingdong watched Gu Caiwei walk towards him, then walked over to her.\n\nGu Caiwei smiled slightly at Shen Lingdong and said, \"You must be starving after a busy noon.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she handed the lunchbox in her hand to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then took the lunchbox from Gu Caiwei's hand and said slowly, \"Actually, I'm not that hungry...\"\n\n\"Not hungry, but you still have to eat.\" Gu Caiwei said to Shen Lingdong in a commanding tone.\n\n\"Alright.\" Shen Lingdong opened the lunchbox, glanced at the food inside, and then said, \"The dishes look good. I'll eat in the lounge.\"\n\nA hint of joy appeared on Gu Caiwei's face, and she nodded, \"I'll get back to work first. You can just put the lunchbox on my desk after you're done. No need to wash it, I'll wash it myself when I have time.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and walked downstairs.\n\nUpon arriving at the lounge, Shen Lingdong looked at the food in the lunchbox, then looked around. To be able to eat food from the police station's cafeteria and have a meeting in the conference room, even if he couldn't become a police officer, he felt he had no regrets.\n\nAfter eating, Shen Lingdong washed the lunchbox inside and out until it was spotless, as he was quite professional in that regard.\n\nThen, he placed the lunchbox on Gu Caiwei's desk and also left Director Sun's meal card there, asking her to return it to Director Sun for him.\n\n...\n\nReturning to the company, Wang Jizhong was eating with several other people on the first floor.\n\n\"Where did you go?\"\n\n\"I went to the criminal investigation team,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"Did you find any new clues?\" Wang Jizhong asked.\n\n\"If nothing unexpected happens, the case should be solved soon,\" Shen Lingdong said with a smile, then walked upstairs.\n\nNot long after, Wang Jizhong also came upstairs and entered Shen Lingdong's office. Just as he was about to take out his cigarette case, he saw the words \"No Smoking\" posted on the wall.\n\nWang Jizhong frowned and said, \"Are you targeting me? If you don't let me smoke, I have no energy to work.\"\n\n\"Just kidding.\" Shen Lingdong stood up, tore down the sign, then took an ashtray from the side and placed it in front of Wang Jizhong, saying, \"I bought this for you specifically. Next time, don't stick cigarette butts in the flower pots.\"\n\n\"Heh heh, I'm used to it,\" Wang Jizhong chuckled. \"What other clues did you find? Tell me about it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then told Wang Jizhong about what happened at the police station.\n\nAfter listening, Wang Jizhong nodded thoughtfully and then asked slowly, \"If we can find out who the WeChat owner is, it would naturally be a good thing. If we can't, it will be difficult. This kind of thing has happened before. Just like the WeChat used by the 'Director,' which belonged to an old man in Shengjing City who was presumed dead.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned.\n\nHe originally thought this case was unrelated to the \"Director,\" but if it was true, then it connected them.\n\nWhat kind of organization were they, to extend their reach across the entire country?\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong continued to ask, \"Do you have any clues as to why they were killed?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head and replied, \"Currently, we can only get the answer after the police solve the case.\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded slightly.\n\nA moment later, Wang Jizhong looked towards the door and said in a low voice to Shen Lingdong, \"I investigated Yuan Yuan's previous workplace. From August 24th to 26th, 2018, their company had a three-day team-building event at Yuhai Villa.\"\n\n\"2018? Yuan Yuan had been working at that shop for several years, so why did she suddenly resign? And come to work for me?\"\n\n\"I heard from her former colleagues that Yuan Yuan comes from a good family and doesn't have any requirements for salary. According to her colleagues, she just came to experience life. Yuan Yuan has always wanted to be a detective. She worked in the murder mystery game industry for so many years and wrote quite a few excellent scripts. The reason she resigned was that she saw a handsome young man, and she wants me to guess who this young man is!\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed helplessly, then sized up Wang Jizhong, and said, \"Brother Wang, if you dress up nicely, you're quite handsome too.\"\n\nWang Jizhong smiled and said, \"Then I'm not the 'young man' she saw. I could be her grandfather.\"\n\nShen Lingdong took out his phone and looked at the 2018 calendar, then said, \"Those days were Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The timing doesn't seem to be a major issue.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's just a coincidence. Besides, Yuan Yuan wasn't the one who decided to have the team-building event at Yuhai Villa. If there's a problem, it's with that shop owner.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly. Just as he was about to exit the phone's calendar, he suddenly saw the lunar date and then smiled, \"The date does have a problem. The lunar dates were the 14th, 15th, and 16th of the seventh month, which were precisely the days of the Ghost Festival. Going to such a remote place on those days shows real guts.\"\n\nWang Jizhong leaned closer to Shen Lingdong, looked at the date, and then fell into thought. After a moment, he said to Shen Lingdong, \"I remember it was raining during those days as well.\"\n\nShen Lingdong's brows furrowed, and he retorted, \"Is this also a coincidence?\"\n\nWang Jizhong took a drag of his cigarette and fell into thought again.\n\nShen Lingdong suddenly laughed and said to Wang Jizhong, \"Brother Wang, your memory is quite good. You remember things from 2018 so clearly? Is that also a coincidence?\"\n\nWang Jizhong took a deep drag of his cigarette and said, \"It's truly a coincidence.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and didn't ask further. Being able to remember what happened on those days indicated that something significant might have happened to Old Wang that day. Coupled with the Ghost Festival, Old Wang must have been paying respects to someone important to make such a deep impression.\n\nSince it was an important person, Shen Lingdong felt it inappropriate to bring up his sorrowful matters.\n\nHowever, Shen Lingdong secretly guessed that the departure of that person might also be related to his retirement.\n\n...\n\nDongjiang City Criminal Investigation Detachment.\n\nZhao Xiaofei rushed into Lin Xiangbei's office holding a document. \"Captain, the identity of the WeChat account owner has been verified.\"\n\n\"In Song Ming's WeChat chat group, the one impersonating Qi Shuang was Sun Fanyi, and the one impersonating Jing Liang was their hospital colleague, Zhao Kangyong...\"\n\nLin Xiangbei's eyes immediately lit up. He took the report and began to read. The names appearing on the list were basically all the people who had appeared in previous investigations.\n\nLu Fei's boss, Zhu Chunxi, Cao Jia Zhi's colleague, Zhang Ming, and Jiang Hua, who played the same game as Gao Qing, all appeared in the police's sight.\n\nIn addition, there was a person named Guo Jian, who impersonated Song Ming, but the police had not yet found any connection between them.\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at it, then looked up and asked Zhao Xiaofei, \"Why is one person missing?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei slowly said, \"We investigated the owner of the WeChat account that impersonated Qiu Gao. The result was that it belonged to a young man from Zhonghai City, but he died of illness when he was young.\"\n\n\"It's like this again.\" Lin Xiangbei slammed the file onto the desk, calmed himself down slightly, then stood up. \"Go and call the other team members to gather downstairs. I'm going to apply to the director to immediately arrest these six individuals. As for those who are missing, issue wanted notices immediately.\"\n\nThe group arrived at the residential complex where Gao Qing and Jiang Hua had impersonated.\n\nThe residential buildings in this complex looked very old, and most of the residents were elderly.\n\nWhen they saw the police appearing in the complex, residents immediately came forward to watch. However, Lin Xiangbei and his team were there to apprehend criminals this time, and they were also carrying firearms, so they first evacuated the onlookers.\n\nSoon, they arrived at Jiang Hua's floor.\n\nLin Xiangbei gently knocked on the door. A moment later, a middle-aged woman opened the door. Seeing dozens of police officers standing at the doorway, she was startled and quickly asked, \"Police... Police officers, what happened?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei directly rushed into the room, while a police officer behind him explained their purpose to the middle-aged woman.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked around, then opened the door to the north bedroom. He saw a young man wearing headphones, sitting in front of a computer playing a game. This person was Jiang Hua.\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately stepped forward and gently patted the young man's shoulder.\n\nThe young man was a bit annoyed and shook his shoulder violently, shouting without turning his head, \"Don't bother me!\"\n\nLin Xiangbei directly knocked off his headphones and said, \"Jiang Hua, you are suspected of murder. Please come with us.\"\n\nJiang Hua turned his head to look at Lin Xiangbei, and the expression on his face immediately became dejected. He then said in a low voice, \"I'll tell you everything. Can you let me finish this game?\"\n\n\"Stand up,\" Lin Xiangbei said expressionlessly.\n\nJiang Hua obediently stood up and cooperatively extended his hands.\n\nLin Xiangbei took out handcuffs, handcuffed Jiang Hua, and then led him out of the room.\n\nThe middle-aged woman kept pestering Lin Xiangbei, begging, \"Police officers, did you make a mistake? My son couldn't have killed someone? He was in his room the whole day that day and never went out.\"\n\nJiang Hua turned his head and looked helplessly at the middle-aged woman.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, looked at the middle-aged woman, and then said, \"You should also come with us.\"\n\n...\n\nThis day was very turbulent in Dongjiang City.\n\nThe Criminal Investigation Detachment, in conjunction with police officers from various district police stations and special police, launched a manhunt for six suspects throughout Dongjiang City. They successfully apprehended five of them. Currently, only Lu Fei's boss, Zhu Chunxi, remains at large.\n\nHe had fled to Nanling City. The Nanling City police had already located him and were organizing his apprehension.\n\nIn addition, the identity of one of the murderers has not yet been determined. Currently, the only hope is to inquire about that person's identity from these suspects.\n\nIn the interrogation room, a man in his thirties sat opposite Lin Xiangbei. This man was Zhang Ming, Cao Jia Zhi's former colleague.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at Zhang Ming and asked slowly, \"Zhang Ming, tell me about your situation. Why did you kill Cao Jia Zhi?\"\n\n\"Because he caused me to be unable to stay in the teaching profession. In the end, I had to work for a cleaning company.\"\n\n\"How did he harm you?\" Lin Xiangbei immediately asked.\n\nZhang Ming swallowed and then slowly said, \"We both taught at the same school, and we were both homeroom teachers. During Teacher's Day the year before last, a student's parent gave me a gift, and he found out about it. Later, I was reported, and my teaching license was immediately suspended.\"\n\n\"Just because of this matter?\" Lin Xiangbei retorted.\n\nZhang Ming gritted his teeth and nodded, roaring, \"He was just jealous of me! Jealous that my class's students had better academic performance than theirs, jealous that I was an outstanding teacher, so he reported me. So many teachers in the school did this, why did he report only me?\"\n\n\"After I left the school, I changed many jobs. Later, I worked at Anjie Housekeeping. As a man, doing cleaning work like this is too shameful. Everything that has happened to me now is caused by Cao Jia Zhi. I wanted to kill him. A while ago, when I went to Zhu Chunxi's company to do cleaning, I met Zhu Chunxi. He was having a conflict with Lu Fei at the time. The look in his eyes was that he wanted to kill Lu Fei.\"\n\n\"Because of the code?\"\n\nZhang Ming shook his head slightly and then said, \"No, I'm not very clear about the specific reason. I told him about my situation with Cao Jia Zhi. At first, he didn't say anything, but later, I gathered from his words that he also wanted me to kill Cao Jia Zhi. However, to avoid police suspicion, he proposed a method of reciprocal murder. Later, he got to know someone else, who among them, I'm not entirely sure. I was pulled into a group. Someone proposed a murder method, but it required our cooperation, which was to create a 'snow mountain villa' case.\"\n\n\"About six months ago, we started impersonating the targets we wanted to kill, and found ways to get the seven of them to interact online. However, this part was not done by me. In short, these people met online. Because I could get the key to Yuhai Villa, I had another key made outside. We didn't need to do the killing ourselves, but we designed the murder plan ourselves.\"\n\n\"It wasn't until about half a month ago that they started to act. I also received a photo of Cao Jia Zhi's death, and the method of death was the one I designed.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei interrupted Zhang Ming and immediately asked, \"Who are they referring to?\"\n\nZhang Ming immediately said, \"In our WeChat group, there is a very mysterious person. In fact, those of us who are involved have met in private, but we have never seen that person's appearance or known their name.\"\n\n\"Then what do you usually call him?\" Lin Xiangbei immediately asked.\n\n\"Deputy Director.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, then asked, \"Lu Fei was killed outside. Who was present at the time?\"\n\nZhang Ming shook his head slightly and said, \"These matters were not discussed in the group. All arrangements were made privately by the Deputy Director.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated for a moment, then said to Zhang Ming, \"Tell me the details of how the murder was designed.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei turned to look at the police officer next to him, then stood up and walked out, heading to another interrogation room.\n\n7017k",

    "content": "Special Field Cleaner Text Volume Chapter 102 The truth comes out of the review room. Lin Xiangbei comes to Guo Jian’s review room next door. He is the person who pretends to be Song Ming’s WeChat and chats with the deceased.\n\nAs soon as he entered the room, Zhao Xiaofei hurriedly called \"Lin Team\"\n\n\"How is it?\"\n\n\"All the tricks.\" Zhao Xiaofei hurriedly took the record to Lin Xiangbei. There was no too many records on it, only one sentence, I killed everyone\n\nLin Xiangbei looked up at Guo Jian and asked in confusion: \"Everyone was killed by you.\"\n\nGuo Jian clicked a little\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at Naruto's eyebrows, pulled a chair from the side, sat on it, and asked, \"Then tell me, how did Yang Liang die?\"\n\nSeeing that Guo Jian didn't say anything, Lin Xiangbei continued to ask, \"Can you tell me?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at the confession again, and then said quietly, \"When you arrested you, you were very involved. When you recorded your confession, you left a sentence that everyone was killed by you, and then you refused to cooperate. The contrast between you is a bit big, and others have already expressed the truth. If you are like this, you are not the lieutenant, and you may be sentenced seriously.\"\n\n\"Is the death penalty?\" Guo Jian raised his head and looked at Lin Xiangbei. A silk thread was raised upwards at the corner of his mouth. The angle was not big, so it was difficult to see\n\nBut Lin Xiangbei noticed\n\nHow do you feel he looks like he is still happy\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Give him his message to me.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei immediately sent a table to Lin Xiangbei\n\nLin Xiangbei took a look and finally saw his wife and daughter who died in 2017 due to a car\n\nLin Xiangbei thought for a while, then raised his head and said to Guo Jian, \"If you really don't want to live anymore, you won't wait until now. Maybe this idea has appeared in your brain for a long time, but you don't have the courage to face death. In other words, you are not yet alive.\"\n\nAt this time, Guo Jian's eyes were red, he clenched his fists with both hands, smashed his chair and said, \"I want to die.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei raised his chin slightly and said, \"Speak why do you want to die?\"\n\nGuo Jian hesitated for a moment, then slowly opened his mouth, \"My wife and children are dead, I want to go down early and get together with them.\"\n\n\"It has something to do with Song Ming\"\n\nGuo Jian pointed his head slightly and then said, \"One day, I drove on my own with my wife and children. When I returned to Dongjiang City, it was already midnight. When I was about to enter Dongjiang City, a car hit my car from the side. My car turned over and flew to the bottom of the slope.\n\nWhen I was in a daze, I saw a figure standing on the road to check\n\nWhen I woke up, I was already lying in the hospital, and my wife and children had left me forever. At that time, they were sleeping in the car and never woke up again.\n\nThe next day, the traffic warning told me that the driver of the accident had been found, but when I saw that person, it was not the figure in my memory.\n\nUntil, a year ago, I accidentally saw Song Ming, and I recognized him, he was the real driver of the accident that year.\"Later, when I was going to go to an agency to sell a house, I met Zhao Kangyong, who was planning to buy a house. He bought my house and his original house was also sold. He planned to change a smaller house. Although he liked my house, the price was a bit expensive. Finally, I didn't buy it. Later, one time, we met in a roasting pot. Because we were all the same person, we just joined the table and afterwards, every time he went out to drink, he would ask me to talk about why I drank wine alone. He mentioned his former colleague, a doctor.\n\nI also mentioned Song Ming. I said I wanted to kill him, but it was just a drink. However, he was really serious. Later, under his advice, my idea of killing Song Ming became stronger and stronger. Later, he proposed an idea to let me kill Yang Liang, and he killed Song Ming. I agreed. While I was thinking about what to do, Zhao Kangyong and I were pulled into a group. In addition to me, there were five people.\n\nOne of them said he was an associate director of a drama group. He told us his intentions directly. He wanted to kill someone, but now that the investigation technology is incomparable to cash and is full of money, it is not easy to kill someone, so he had to plan a precise plan, not only to make the police unable to find the certificate, but also to be able to protect himself from taking it off.\n\nAlthough I was a little scared at that time, I heard him say that we were planning to do what he said and then he asked me to re-register a WeChat number and modify it into the WeChat headline and nickname of their respective goals and tasks.\n\nThere are seven groups in total. I am responsible for posting Song Ming’s chat content to the group that did not have Song Ming. Until a month ago, the assistant director informed us to prepare for the move.\n\nTwo more days later, I received a photo of Song Ming's death. I don't know how he moved.\n\nFinally, the assistant director said, \"Happy cooperation, take care of each other\", and then disbanded the group.\n\nI was very nervous these days. I wanted to kill myself for fear of sin, but I didn’t have that courage. I also have parents. They need my care. This is my responsibility. If one day they are gone, I might really die and gather with my wife and daughters.”\n\nAt this time, Lin Xiangbei said, \"So you want to put all the charges down and sentence you to death.\"\n\nGuo Jian clicked a little\n\nLin Xiangbei sighed and then said, \"Let's rest first.\"\n\nSpeaking of the slightest, Shen Lingdong rushed to the small flying hand and walked outside.\n\nWhen they arrived outside the interview room, Lin Xiangbei said to Zhao Xiaofeng, \"I remember that their house seems to be no far from the agency where Zhao Bo is. Go and check immediately where his house was sold.\"\n\n\"Yes\" Zhao Xiaofei returned to the office quickly\n\nLin Xiangbei came to the monitoring room and checked the others' questions. The other three confessed as expected. In addition to each person's story, the subsequent process was as follows: Zhang Ming and Guo Jian said.It took no time for Zhao Xiao to fly out of the monitoring room and said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Head, Guo Jian's house was once listed on Zhaobo's intermediary, but it was not sold by Zhaobo.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Arrange two people to show off the Zhaobao Monitor, and any swearing movements should be like my report.\"\n\n\"yes\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei's mobile phone suddenly started to catch up and checked immediately. It was a message sent by Shen Lingdong, \"Catch Zhaobo immediately, he wants to run away.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei's eyebrows rose up and immediately called Zhao Xiaofei, saying, \"Xiaofei, wait a moment, you can bring Zhaobo directly, you can contact Shen Lingdong and ask Zhaobo's location.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei also had a slight brow, and then walked outside.\n\n...\n\nAfter Shen Lingdong returned from the police station, he stayed in the company for a short time. His mobile phone suddenly started to reopen. He was Gao Qing's parents.\n\nThey've figured it out\n\nI wanted to make my son's room cleaner. I originally planned to slap Gao Qing's mother by herself, but she couldn't. Although I accepted the fact that my son had died, every item in the room could evoke endless recollections.\n\nTherefore, Shen Lingdong came to handle it\n\nThere was only one room and the area was not very large. Shen Lingdong decided to go there by himself\n\nThree hours of time, the room was sorted out. This time, when he left, Shen Lingdong did not take a garbage bag down the building except for the tool kit in his hand.\n\nSome things should not be treated as garbage, but should be treasured by the victims.\n\nShen Lingdong didn't charge any fees, just drink a glass of water.\n\nOn the way back to the company, Shen Lingdong saw the agency where Zhaobo was located. After thinking for a while, Shen Lingdong parked the car in front of the company door.\n\nHowever, it took not long before Shen Lingdong saw Zhao Bo coming out of the agency, carrying a backpack in his hand and getting on a luxury car\n\nShen Lingdong felt a little disagreeable, so he quickly sent Lin Xiangbei a WeChat message, asking them to arrest Zhao Bo. Later, he quickly adjusted the head of the car and chased after him.\n\nShen Lingdong chased after him for an hour in the direction of the suburbs.\n\nFinally, Zhaobo's car hit a tree, Zhaobo also got off the car and ran towards the tail building next to it. Shen Lingdong also hurriedly walked up.\n\nIt's dark\n\nZhao Bo's figure soon disappeared into Shen Lingdong's video\n\nShen Lingdong touched the tail building vigilantly, and found a positioning for Xiaofei.\n\nAt this moment, a black shadow suddenly appeared at the entrance of the stairs and ran up the building.\n\nShen Lingdong hurriedly chased after him and soon arrived at the top floor\n\nAt this time, Zhaobo is in front of the window\n\nZhao Bo looked at Shen Lingdong who was slowly approaching him, then smiled slightly and said, \"It seems that I have no way to escape.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stopped three meters away from Zhaobo and said slowly, \"I know that there is a dead end, but I still run upwards. I am either a fool or a genius. I guess you deliberately led me here and then planned to kill me.\"\n\n\"You know you're still following you and you can wait for the police to arrive under the building. I thought you were very smart, but I was wrong. You don't understand the truth that a gentleman doesn't stand under a dangerous wall.\"\n\nShen Lingdong snorted coldly and said, \"Then we have to see who is a dangerous wall.\"\n\nZhao Bo faced Shen Lingdong from behind, then took out a thin steel bar with a thumb from behind, and weighed it in his hand.\n\nShen Lingdong asked calmly: \"Who is the director?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you when you die.\"\n\nSpeaking of the situation, Zhao Bo followed the steel and rushed towards Shen Lingdong...\n\nAfter you came and I fought, both of them were injured. Shen Lingdong's arms were actually stuck with two sticks, and there was a little blood hanging from the corners of his mouth. Fortunately, he was standing, Zhao Bo was lying on the ground with blood in his face, and his chest was undulating.\n\nShen Lingdong took away the stick beside Zhaobo with one foot, leaned on the pillar next to him, covered his right shoulder with his left hand, and then opened a slight inquiry: \"I want to know how you planned this case.\"\n\n\"You... tell me first, how did you see me...I have a problem?\" Zhao Bo said breathlessly\n\n\"At the moment you opened the door, I was taken a little bit by the sunlight and shook my eyes. I suddenly remembered that on the day I went to your company, I was in front of the Yuhai Mountain Gate, where you left footprints, chatting with your colleagues. In that location, you couldn't see the situation inside. You had to stick it on the glass and cover it with your hands to see the inside clearly. The time of that day coincides with what you said when you appeared in Yuhai Mountain. I understood it when you already know who is lying inside. You just need to make a certificate at the door, but this has become your only break. If it weren't for this, it would be a perfect crime. According to the movie's rating, you can get at least 49 points.\"\n\nZhao Bo raised his head slightly, his eyes filled with blood, and he couldn't see Shen Lingdong in the shadow clearly, \"So that's it...\"\n\n\"The perfect crime is not to make the police not know who the handle is, but who the handle is clearly, but the police cannot catch you, which is also a perfect crime. If you can kill me, you can compensate for the previous mistakes. It's a pity that you don't have that opportunity... You said, what happened in the Yuhai Mountain Trail.\"\n\n\"Hmph\" Zhao Bo sneered in a difficult manner and said quietly, \"I pretended to fly and got into them. When I arrived at Shanzhuang, Song Ming and Cao Jiazhi had already arrived before me. At that time, Cao Jiazhi was preparing classes in the room because I was under his floor, I deliberately played music and made a loud noise to slam him. During class, he also came to me. Of course, I wanted to guide him to the soundproof book room. However, in order to reduce the suspicion on me, I later made excuses to go to the book room and deliberately sprinkled his drinks. Then I had reason to appear in the book room with gloves and mop, and kill him smoothly, without leaving any traces on my body.\"\n\n\"Of course, Song Ming knew that I had gone to the book room, but I just needed to let Song Ming know in advance that I knew about his hit-and-run, and I wanted him to kill me, but as long as I stayed with others, or others stayed with him, he couldn't kill me, even if he knew that I was killing someone.\"\n\n\"Although they all knew that people died in the room, they were more panicked. I was the first to leave here, but how could Song Ming let me leave here? He could come here just to kill me. If he didn't let me leave here, and even said that I was the killing Cao Jiazhi, they were just guessing and couldn't come out, so they would choose to isolate me. Their five of them held a group in the entertainment room to negotiate how to deal with me.\"\n\n\"I also gave me the opportunity to act alone. I don't need anyone else to accompany me anyway. I can say that the reason why most of them stayed is the appearance of the real flying body to kill me can make them start to fall apart.\"\n\n7017k",

At that point, they could have left completely, but why is there no indication that they wanted to leave?\"\n\nZhao Bo smiled slightly and then said, \"The seeds of the devil sprout in the heart, and the remaining rationality will be quickly devoured. I put notes under everyone's room, telling them that I already knew about their affairs. They would think I did it, but when they saw Lu Fei's body, they knew there was another killer. They wouldn't leave until they found that person and killed him.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and then asked, \"What about Gao Qing? Who did he offend? What leverage do you have on him?\"\n\n\"Gao Qing, hehe, his leverage is his female classmate. I told him that the female classmate he liked was kidnapped and that if he wanted her to live, he had to stay. As for Jiang Hua, who arranged to meet Gao Qing for a game trade, he had a game power leveling studio. At that time, he had formed it online with a few gaming friends. However, in the game, they couldn't beat Gao Qing. Plus, with the game company cracking down on power leveling, his studio soon went bankrupt, and he owed over a hundred thousand yuan in debt. His partners threatened him, saying that he either had to pay back the money or hand over Gao Qing's account as compensation.\"\n\n\"In the game, he did have a certain status, but in reality, he was just a shut-in who dreamed of being a boss. He didn't dare to tell his parents. Unable to repay the debt, a little persuasion was enough to stir up evil thoughts.\"\n\nShen Lingdong's face darkened, and he asked, \"In other words, Gao Hua was killed by you without doing anything?\"\n\nZhao Bo sighed slightly and then said, \"What use is a person like him alive? He's over thirty and spends all day playing games, still living off his parents. Do you think he has any reason to be alive?\"\n\nJust then, several police cars appeared downstairs.\n\nZhao Bo smiled slightly and then asked, \"Is it the police? Why didn't I hear the sirens? I've always been curious why they sound the sirens when arresting criminals. Aren't they afraid the criminals will escape?\"\n\n\"It's not a TV show. One reason for sounding the sirens is to let other vehicles on the road avoid them, so as not to delay the arrest. In reality, there are requirements for sounding sirens; you can't just sound them whenever you want.\"\n\n\"So that's how it is.\"\n\n\"Why are you the assistant director? Tell me about the director.\" Shen Lingdong asked Zhao Bo.\n\nZhao Bo slowly propped himself up and asked Shen Lingdong, supporting himself on the ground, \"If you let me go, I might tell you.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" Shen Lingdong said expressionlessly.\n\n\"Then come closer, and I'll tell you...\"\n\n\"You say it right there.\"\n\nAt this moment, the sound of police footsteps climbing the stairs could be heard inside the building.\n\nZhao Bo then slowly began to speak, \"I'm not some assistant director. The position I interviewed for was assistant director. If I hadn't been caught, I would have...\"\n\n\"You would have what?\" Shen Lingdong pressed when Zhao Bo didn't continue.\n\n\"I would have become the real assistant director!\" As he spoke, Zhao Bo suddenly raised his hand and threw a handful of sand at Shen Lingdong.\n\nWhile Shen Lingdong dodged, Zhao Bo picked up the steel rebar on the ground and charged at Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly dodged.\n\nBut the next moment, the steel rebar in Zhao Bo's hand was at Shen Lingdong's neck.\n\nJust then, Zhao Xiaofei rushed to Shen Lingdong's floor with the police. Zhao Bo quickly held Shen Lingdong hostage and shouted at Zhao Xiaofei and the others, \"If you take another step forward, I'll kill him.\"\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong said softly to Zhao Bo, \"It's no use. You can't escape.\"\n\n\"Even if I can't escape, I'll still kill you!\"\n\nJust then, Zhao Xiaofei hurriedly shouted at Zhao Bo, \"Zhao Bo, don't move. Shen Lingdong has nothing to do with this. Let him go, and you can be the hostage.\"\n\nZhao Bo sneered and then said, \"Your life is not as valuable as his.\"\n\n\"What are your demands? You can tell me anything.\"\n\n\"You throw away your guns, then all move to that side, and then let me leave.\" Zhao Bo glanced at a room inside.\n\n\"Okay, we'll throw away our guns. Don't hurt Shen Lingdong.\" While speaking, Zhao Xiaofei threw his service pistol onto the ground.\n\nAt that moment, Shen Lingdong sighed silently, then raised his arm, grabbed Zhao Bo's wrist, and pushed him away, ensuring the steel rebar was away from him. He then turned, using the momentum of his turn to strike Zhao Bo's lower ribs with his elbow.\n\nTo prevent Zhao Bo from breaking free, Shen Lingdong quickly hugged Zhao Bo's arm and pressed his wrist downwards. Just as the steel rebar was about to fall, Shen Lingdong flicked his wrist, and the rebar was thrown behind him.\n\nHowever, Zhao Bo, enduring the severe pain, clenched his other hand and struck Shen Lingdong's ribs.\n\nShen Lingdong, in pain, released Zhao Bo's wrist.\n\nZhao Bo quickly retreated two steps but accidentally stepped on the rebar, his foot slipped, and he fell backward.\n\nWith a dull thud.\n\nZhao Bo's head hit the edge of the windowsill, and he immediately fell unconscious.\n\nShen Lingdong slumped to the ground, clutching his left ribs.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei also rushed forward to check on Zhao Bo, who was lying on the ground. Seeing that Zhao Bo was motionless, he checked his breathing and the pulse on his neck, then said to the other police officers, \"Quick, call 120!\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked in Zhao Bo's direction with a face full of terror.\n\n\"I killed someone?\" Shen Lingdong said blankly to Zhao Xiaofei. Suddenly, he felt his stomach churn and immediately bent over to dry heave.\n\nZhao Xiaofei had two police officers watch Zhao Bo and then came to Shen Lingdong's side, sat next to him, patted his back gently, and then comforted him softly, \"He's not dead yet, and it has nothing to do with you. We all saw it; he fell on his own.\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei smiled and said, \"You didn't react like this even when cleaning up so many murder scenes. Why are you vomiting now? I finally found something I'm better than you at.\"\n\nShen Lingdong gently wiped his mouth, remained silent, rested his hands on his knees, and stared blankly at the ground.\n\nZhao Xiaofei patted Shen Lingdong's shoulder, then stood up, took out his phone, and reported the situation to Captain Lin.\n\nNot long after, the 120 ambulance arrived, checked Zhao Bo's condition, but by this time, Zhao Bo had no vital signs. They then examined Shen Lingdong and took him away.\n\nAfter being sent to the hospital, Shen Lingdong underwent a full body examination. He only had superficial injuries and was not seriously hurt. After the doctor treated his wounds, he informed Shen Lingdong that he could leave the hospital.\n\nShen Lingdong had not yet recovered from his emotions and walked out blankly, not even noticing Gu Caiwei, who had rushed to the hospital. He only stopped when he reached Gu Caiwei.\n\nGu Caiwei looked Shen Lingdong up and down and quickly asked, \"How did you get hurt like this?\"\n\nShen Lingdong ignored Gu Caiwei, walked around her, and continued to walk outside.\n\nGu Caiwei then followed Shen Lingdong, not saying a word, just quietly staying by his side.\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Shen Lingdong didn't take a taxi and walked towards the side, unsure if that was the way home.\n\nAfter walking for an unknown amount of time, Shen Lingdong saw a flower bed nearby and sat down on it. Gu Caiwei also sat down next to him and said softly, \"I heard everything.\"\n\nShen Lingdong slowly looked up at Gu Caiwei and then asked, \"Have you ever killed someone?\"\n\nGu Caiwei shook her head and then said, \"From the moment I applied to join the criminal investigation team, I knew that I would eventually face this. If I had shot and killed a criminal, I wouldn't know how I would react either.\"\n\nShen Lingdong slowly raised his hands and said softly, \"When I was in school, during shooting training, I imagined countless times shooting and killing criminals. But after I dropped out, I thought such things were far away from me. I can clean up murder scenes, but I can't accept having blood on my hands.\"\n\n\"Moreover, if Zhao Bo were alive, I could have gotten more clues from him. By killing him, the clues are broken.\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei leaned in and gently hugged Shen Lingdong, her hands also gently patting him, \"You've done very well, but this is too dangerous. You're not allowed to do this again next time.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly startled, then released Gu Caiwei and said softly, \"I went to clean up Gao Qing's parents' room this afternoon. Facing the victim's family directly like that doesn't feel good. My mood wasn't good when I left their house. When I discovered Zhao Bo might be the killer, I had only one thought: to catch him.\"\n\n\"I know a very good psychologist. I'll take you to see one tomorrow.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at Gu Caiwei and then nodded slightly, forcing a smile, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Why are you being so polite? After all, we are... classmates, and you are also my team member. This is also what the aftercare team is supposed to do.\"\n\nShen Lingdong breathed a long sigh, took out his phone, and sent a text message to his mother, telling her he would be back late tonight and not to wait for him. He then stood up and said to Gu Caiwei, \"Let's go to the police station. Captain Lin will definitely have a lot of things to ask me.\"\n\nGu Caiwei nodded immediately.\n\n\"Oh, I almost forgot.\" Shen Lingdong tried to raise his arm, but due to the injury, he couldn't lift it at all. He then said to Gu Caiwei, \"Help me take off the camera on my chest. The evidence is all in there.\"\n\n\"You kept a backup?\" Gu Caiwei also stood up and began to retrieve the recording device from Shen Lingdong's chest.\n\n\"I was afraid Lin Xiangbei wouldn't believe my verbal account. I happened to be at Gao Qing's parents' house, so I brought the recording device with me. I'm not sure how much storage space was left, so I only chose to record the crucial parts. They won't fault me for this, right?\"\n\n\"How could they? Evidence you obtained at the risk of your life; they should think about how to reward you.\"\n\nJust then, a passerby rode a shared bicycle past them. Shen Lingdong immediately became anxious, quickly pulled Gu Caiwei into his arms, \"Be careful!\"\n\nHe then said to the passerby, \"Don't look at your phone while cycling!\"\n\nAfter the passerby left, Shen Lingdong suddenly felt a sharp pain in his arm. \"Ouch, it hurts so much.\"\n\nIn his haste, he had used the injured arm to hold Gu Caiwei, and now he felt a piercing pain.\n\n\"Be careful,\" Gu Caiwei smiled, then removed the camera and handed it to Shen Lingdong.\n\nThe two hailed a taxi and arrived at the police station. Shen Lingdong recounted his conversation with Zhao Bo to Lin Xiangbei and handed over the recording device.\n\nAfter handling everything, Shen Lingdong said to Gu Caiwei, \"Let's go, I'll take you home.\"\n\nGu Caiwei quickly shook her head and then said, \"You're the injured one, let me take you home.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei, standing nearby, looked at the two helplessly. After glancing at them, he said, \"Stop arguing. I'll take you both.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Shen Lingdong and Gu Caiwei said in unison.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at the two of them suspiciously and then said, \"Are you two doing this on purpose? Just to get a ride home?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled.\n\n\"Let's go.\" Lin Xiangbei unplugged the USB drive from the computer and then walked outside.\n\nLin Xiangbei handed the USB drive to a police officer and then went outside.\n\nAfter getting into the car, Lin Xiangbei looked in the rearview mirror and said to Shen Lingdong and Gu Caiwei, \"Who should I drop off first?\"\n\n\"Drop her off first,\" Shen Lingdong said, glancing at Gu Caiwei.\n\n\"Drop you off first.\"\n\n\"Let me check the route...\" Lin Xiangbei took out his phone and checked it, then said, \"Let's drop off Gu Caiwei first.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Shen Lingdong nodded.\n\nThe car slowly started.\n\n\"Oh, right. Tomorrow, there's a new person joining the criminal investigation team, Tang Feng. You guys know him, right?\"\n\n\"Who?\" Gu Caiwei asked back.\n\n\"We know him, a classmate,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"Why is he coming to the criminal investigation team?\" Gu Caiwei snorted.\n\nLin Xiangbei asked suspiciously, \"Aren't you classmates? Why don't you welcome him?\"\n\n\"Whether I welcome him or not, I still have to follow your arrangements?\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought you were classmates and would cooperate better. I was originally planning to have him take over Zhao Xiaofei's job. Seeing the situation, it's better to have him follow me. However, try to resolve any conflicts as soon as possible and don't affect unity.\"\n\n\"There shouldn't be any conflicts,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"It's just pure dislike,\" Gu Caiwei seconded.\n\n\"Lingdong, how are you two getting along?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"I don't really remember.\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei said, \"Zhao Xiaofei wanted to compete with Shen Lingdong in all aspects back then. However, Tang Feng's physical fitness is not as good as Shen Lingdong and Zhao Xiaofei, but he aims to suppress Shen Lingdong in criminal investigation.\"\n\n\"Did he suppress you?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"He likes to get stuck on details,\" Shen Lingdong said from the side.\n\n\"Didn't you say you didn't remember?\"\n\n\"I remember now,\" Shen Lingdong said expressionlessly, then turned his head to look out the window, his brow furrowed slightly.",

    "content": "After dropping Gu Caiwei home, only Lin Xiangbei and Shen Lingdong remained in the car. Neither of them spoke for a long time.\n\nFinally, Lin Xiangbei asked, \"Why does Gu Caiwei dislike Tang Feng so much?\"\n\n\"When they were in school, Tang Feng pursued Gu Caiwei, but she rejected him,\" Shen Lingdong replied nonchalantly.\n\n\"So that's it,\" Lin Xiangbei responded lightly. \"It seems we need to ensure their work doesn't overlap. It wouldn't be good if this caused work to be delayed.\"\n\n\"It shouldn't. Tang Feng already has a girlfriend, and they are both police officers, so it won't affect each other's work,\" Shen Lingdong told Lin Xiangbei.\n\n\"That's for the best, of course. By the way, come to the police station tomorrow to fill out some forms...\" Lin Xiangbei said softly.\n\n\"Fill out what forms?\"\n\n\"For the reward. Didn't you see we collected a bounty this time?\"\n\n\"I didn't notice. How much?\"\n\n\"Exactly fifty thousand yuan.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's decent. We can buy a new batch of equipment with that,\" Shen Lingdong's lips curved upwards slightly. He then took out his phone and began browsing online for cleaning equipment.\n\nSoon, Lin Xiangbei also sent Shen Lingdong home. Shen Lingdong originally intended to ask Lin Xiangbei to come upstairs to rest for a while, but Lin Xiangbei needed to return to the police station, so he left first.\n\nShen Lingdong quietly returned upstairs, not even turning on the lights, and tiptoed back to his room.\n\nFortunately, his mother, Li Xianglan, was already asleep. A note was left on the table: \"The food is in the refrigerator, heat it yourself.\" Shen Lingdong suddenly felt his stomach rumble. He then took out food from the refrigerator and heated it in the microwave.\n\nWhile he was waiting, his mother suddenly appeared in the kitchen and came next to Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"You're back,\" Li Xianglan said, pouring a glass of water. After drinking, she added, \"Get some sleep early.\"\n\nThen she left. Throughout the entire interaction, she didn't notice Shen Lingdong's injured arm.\n\nShen Lingdong remained still, cradling his arm, and only relaxed after his mother left.\n\nAfter his food was heated, he quickly ate and went back to his room to sleep.\n\nThe next day.\n\nShen Lingdong first went to the company, collected everyone's recorders, organized the videos, and wrote a cleanup report for the victimized villa. Afterward, he headed to the police station to submit these items to Gu Caiwei.\n\nThen, he found Lin Xiangbei and filled out a form to go through the process of collecting the reward money.\n\nJust as Shen Lingdong was about to leave, Lin Xiangbei suddenly called out to him, \"Wait a moment, I have something to show you. If you think it's okay, then sign it.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he took out a contract from his drawer and handed it to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong took it and couldn't help but frown. It was an employment contract for a criminal investigation consultant. \"What does this mean?\"\n\n\"This is also considered a reward for you. Director Sun has already agreed. Your capabilities have been recognized.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Thank you, but I haven't quite decided yet...\"\n\n\"Oh, that's alright. You can take the contract back with you. Bring it to me when you've decided and filled it out.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"I'll leave the contract here for now. I'll come to sign it when I've made up my mind.\"\n\n\"That's fine too.\"\n\nShen Lingdong returned the contract to Lin Xiangbei and then left his office.\n\nAfter leaving Lin Xiangbei's office, Shen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then walked towards Director Sun's office. Because of his injury, he couldn't help with the cleanup for now, and he needed to explain this to Director Sun...\n\nThat evening, after Gu Caiwei finished work, he accompanied her to a psychological clinic.\n\nIt was a beautifully decorated psychological clinic, and its style was very comforting.\n\nSoon, a female doctor in a white coat appeared before Shen Lingdong. This doctor was very beautiful and had a good figure, wearing black-rimmed glasses, with a glint in her eyes.\n\nThe female doctor smiled slightly at Gu Caiwei and said, \"Caiwei, you're here?\"\n\nFrom the way she addressed her, it was clear they had a close relationship.\n\n\"Su Qing, long time no see.\"\n\nThe female doctor nodded, looked at Shen Lingdong beside Gu Caiwei, and then asked Gu Caiwei, \"Is this the detective you were talking about?\"\n\n\"Dr. Su, hello.\" Shen Lingdong greeted her.\n\nAt this moment, both the female doctor and Gu Caiwei smiled. Then, Gu Caiwei introduced Shen Lingdong, \"Her surname is Lin, her name is Lin Su Qing.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately felt a bit awkward and quickly corrected himself, \"Oh, oh, Dr. Lin...\"\n\nLin Su Qing looked Shen Lingdong up and down and said, \"You seem to be in good spirits. Come in.\"\n\n\"I'll wait outside then,\" Gu Caiwei said.\n\nLin Su Qing led Shen Lingdong into a room, where Shen Lingdong lay down on a chair.\n\nLin Su Qing sat opposite Shen Lingdong, holding a form. After a slight hesitation, she began marking it and then said to Shen Lingdong, \"You don't think you need psychological intervention? Even if you experienced temporary fear, it was just temporary. But I'm telling you, you don't feel fear now because your desires are suppressing it. This is not a good phenomenon. Once your desires are satisfied someday, that accumulated fear will become something very terrifying.\"\n\n\"What terrifying thing?\" Shen Lingdong asked Lin Su Qing.\n\n\"Tell me first, how did that person die?\"\n\n\"At the time, he held me hostage with a steel bar, but I still had the ability to fight back. I knocked the steel bar out of his hand, and it fell about a meter behind him. Then he attacked me again. When he was escaping, he accidentally stepped on the steel bar and slipped, hitting the window sill.\"\n\nLin Su Qing nodded and then said, \"This is one of the problems. You remember it too clearly. When experiencing major trauma, some memories become very hazy. So, you remember exactly what you were doing, and this plants a hidden danger.\"\n\n\"What hidden danger?\" Shen Lingdong asked again.\n\n\"When your desires are satisfied, these memories will transform into something else.\"\n\n\"All I want now is to find out if my father is truly the killer. If one day I know the truth, is that what you call desire? What will it become? Is there any way to avoid it?\"\n\nLin Su Qing then said, \"Your desire is to get your father out of prison. Even if the truth isn't what you think, you'll make it so. For example, in this murder case, the real killer accidentally died, and it wasn't really related to you, but you attribute it to yourself. So, the real killer's death will also be transformed into you orchestrating his death...\"\n\nShen Lingdong was startled.\n\nLin Su Qing continued, \"For example... a fight that completely overwhelmed the real killer... deliberately being held hostage... throwing the steel bar onto the real killer's escape route, causing him to fall. Everything was planned by you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong laughed and said, \"That's a bit far-fetched. I can forget some things, but my memory shouldn't change, right?\"\n\nLin Su Qing immediately replied, \"The Mandela effect, but it will be more severe in your case.\"\n\n\"So I will think I am the killer?\"\n\nLin Su Qing did not answer Shen Lingdong's question and then slowly said, \"I'll play some relaxing music for you. You can sleep here for an hour. I'll go out and catch up with Gu Caiwei.\"\n\nShen Lingdong slowly nodded and then leaned back on the sofa.\n\nAccompanied by the soothing music, Shen Lingdong also slowly closed his eyes.\n\nAn hour later, Lin Su Qing and Gu Caiwei appeared in the room and gently woke Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong slowly opened his eyes, stretched his body, and said to Gu Caiwei and Lin Su Qing, \"It's been a long time since I slept so comfortably.\"\n\nLin Su Qing nodded and then said, \"You can come here once a week.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly shook his head and said, \"Better not. I heard psychological treatment isn't cheap, and I don't have that kind of money...\"\n\nLin Su Qing smiled slightly and then said, \"You can't afford the electricity fee? For Caiwei's sake, when I don't have patients, you can come here and sleep for a while, but you'll have to cover the electricity costs during that time.\"\n\n\"I'll consider it.\"\n\nSaying that, Shen Lingdong stood up, checked the time, and then continued, \"It's so late. I won't disturb Su... I mean, Dr. Lin.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter leaving the clinic, Shen Lingdong prepared to escort Gu Caiwei home.\n\nThe clinic wasn't far from Gu Caiwei's home, so the two decided to walk back.\n\nDuring the walk, there was a period of silence before Shen Lingdong suddenly asked, \"Did Tang Feng report for duty today? I didn't see him when I went to the criminal investigation team.\"\n\n\"He did. He started working right after reporting. He's been stuck in the technical department. When I got off work, he seemed to still be there.\"\n\n\"Is he investigating something?\"\n\n\"I don't know... but he was reprimanded by Captain Lin as soon as he arrived today.\"\n\n\"For what reason?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I saw him go into Captain Lin's office with his laptop, and a short while later, he came out looking dejected. Are you very concerned about what he's investigating? I can help you find out tomorrow...\"\n\n\"Forget it. Let him do whatever he wants.\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei asked, \"What did Lin Su Qing say to you?\"\n\n\"She didn't say much. Didn't she tell you?\" Shen Lingdong countered.\n\n\"No, she didn't. We just chatted. Girl talk, hehe,\" Gu Caiwei said with a smile.\n\n\"How did you two meet?\" Shen Lingdong continued to ask.\n\n\"We met around the time you just dropped out of school. Then she went to another city, but recently she returned to Dongjiang City and opened a psychological clinic. I only reconnected with her recently, so we haven't seen each other for over a year.\"\n\n\"Does she write mysteries?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Why do you ask? However, she has a friend who writes mysteries. It's the husband of the lawyer Zhong Ning I told you about last time, he writes mysteries.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Shen Lingdong responded lightly and then fell into thought. He had a feeling that Lin Su Qing seemed to be deliberately guiding him, making him think he might become a killer...\n\nThat is to say, brainwashing.\n\nShe was definitely not treating him, but trying to make him sick...\n\nAs they walked, Gu Caiwei suddenly stopped.\n\nShen Lingdong also stopped and quickly asked, \"Why aren't we walking anymore? Are you tired? Shall we take a taxi?\"\n\n\"Look behind you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately turned his head and looked behind him.\n\nBehind him was a small square, and in the middle of the square stood a giant red heart decorated with various twinkling lights.\n\nThe constantly changing lights reflected on their faces.\n\n\"What a romantic place! How did I not notice it before?\" Gu Caiwei said, looking at the giant red heart.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and replied, \"It's quite bright.\"\n\nHearing Shen Lingdong's grunt, Gu Caiwei then said, \"Take a picture for me, and I'll take one for you later.\"\n\n\"I'll pass.\"\n\n\"No,\" Gu Caiwei said in a commanding tone.\n\nUnder Gu Caiwei's insistence, Shen Lingdong took a photo of her, and then he was also photographed. However, because his arm was injured, he deliberately hid his injured arm behind him.\n\nBut Gu Caiwei seemed not entirely satisfied with the photo. She took several more, constantly adjusting their positions until she was happy.\n\nShen Lingdong couldn't understand it at all. When taking a photo, as long as it was recognizable, it was enough.\n\nLooking at the two photos, Gu Caiwei sighed and said, \"We've known each other for so long, but we still don't have a photo together, do we?\"\n\n\"Yes, we do. The one from military training when we enrolled,\" Shen Lingdong quickly replied.\n\n\"How about we take one separately?\"\n\n\"No, maybe later. It's too late, let's hurry home.\"\n\nGu Caiwei pouted, put away her phone with a hint of disappointment, and then left the place.\n\nAfter sending Gu Caiwei home, Shen Lingdong also returned to his own home.\n\nPerhaps it was because he had slept at Lin Su Qing's psychological clinic, but now he couldn't fall asleep. He tossed and turned in bed.\n\nJust as he was about to fall asleep, Gu Caiwei suddenly sent a message.\n\nIt was the photos taken at the square earlier. She had combined their photos, cropping each photo in half, so they fit together perfectly to form a complete picture. It looked like they were standing close together, and Shen Lingdong's hidden arm looked like he was embracing Gu Caiwei.\n\n\"Spreading rumors, you're spreading rumors about me. I wasn't embracing you,\" Shen Lingdong replied.\n\n\"Hehe, this counts as a photo together, doesn't it? Who told you not to take one with me. Alright, get some sleep early.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the photo, unable to fall asleep for a long time.\n\n...\n\nFor the next period, Shen Lingdong focused his attention on his company.\n\nDuring this time, there were very few murder cases. Shen Lingdong shifted his focus to ordinary cleaning services. He even took on a big job. He \"coincidentally\" obtained the contact information of the owner of Yuhai Villa. The owner did not intend to close Yuhai Villa but planned to continue operating it, and the cleaning work would also continue.\n\nAt Shen Lingdong's persuasion, Wu Anguo entrusted this business to Shen Lingdong. It was for 100,000 yuan annually, with cleaning once a week. After guests left, cleaning was still required. A three-year contract was signed.\n\nFor this, Shen Lingdong even hired four more people.\n\nCoincidentally, the hardware store next door was available for rent, so Shen Lingdong rented it out as well, specifically for storage.\n\nNow, \"Sunshine Cleaning\" had a certain reputation in Dongjiang City, especially with the cleaning agent Shen Lingdong personally made, which had strong decontamination capabilities. Some people even contacted Shen Lingdong wanting to buy the formula.\n\nShen Lingdong did not sell it.\n\nThis cleaning agent had excellent decontamination capabilities and was effective for cleaning bloodstains. He would never disclose it. However, he did give the cleaning agent to someone. Li Hui, whom he met at Chengdong Residential Area, also opened a cleaning company in Nanling City, right across from his daughter's school. He heard that he was doing well there, his relationship with his ex-wife had eased considerably, and he could see his daughter often. He had even invited Shen Lingdong and Gu Caiwei to visit him there when they had time.\n\nAlthough Shen Lingdong agreed, he didn't have any plans to go there for the time being.\n\nBoth he and Gu Caiwei were quite busy.",

    "title": "Chapter 105 Promise",
    "content": "**Special Scene Cleaning Master - Chapter 105: The Promise**\n\nDecember 19th.\n\nThe first snow of 2021 arrived.\n\nShen Lingdong sat in his office, looking out at the misty scene outside. Snowflakes crisscrossed the air, spinning and gliding like flowers and down, weaving a surging, pure white romance.\n\nThe snow had come a little suddenly.\n\nSince the beginning of winter, Sunshine Cleaning's business volume had increased. This period, leading up to Chinese New Year, was considered a peak season.\n\nHowever, there hadn't been many murder cases recently, and the newly purchased batch of cleaning machines had been sitting in the warehouse for a long time.\n\nShen Lingdong took out his phone and checked the weather forecast. It said that Dongjiang City, affected by a Siberian cold current, was expected to experience snowfall for four or five days, causing a significant temperature drop.\n\nHe thought that his down jacket hadn't been replaced in many years. Should he get a new one?\n\nAfter a moment of thought, he decided against it. Although he had worn it for a long time, he had maintained it well. It was still about 70% new, so he could make do with it for another year.\n\nAlthough the company's business was good, the money was all in the company's accounts, and he didn't have much cash on hand.\n\nHowever, he could order a batch of winter clothes in the company's name.\n\nJust as Shen Lingdong was about to go downstairs to have Yuan Yuan tally the employees' clothing sizes, the company phone rang. It was the real estate agency, informing Sunshine Cleaning that guests would be staying at Yuhai Mountain Villa tomorrow and they needed the villa thoroughly cleaned today.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the weather outside and then at the people in the room. All the other regular cleaning staff had already gone out. Only Shen Lingdong, Zheng Daoguang, and Wang Jizhong, the three cleaning specialists, remained in the room.\n\n\"Why don't the three of us go clean?\"\n\nWang Jizhong immediately stood up and picked up his jacket, saying, \"Sure, no problem.\"\n\nZheng Daoguang chimed in from the side, \"I have no problem either, but I need to go home early tonight. It's my wife's birthday.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the time and then said, \"We'll have enough time. We just cleaned there three days ago, so it shouldn't be too dirty. We can do a simple cleaning. We should be done by 3 PM, and then you can go home?\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Zheng Daoguang also picked up his jacket and followed Shen Lingdong to move the cleaning equipment from the warehouse.\n\nWith the tools loaded, they drove the van and set off.\n\nAn hour later, the three arrived at Yuhai Mountain Villa and immediately began the cleaning work, from top to bottom, from left to right.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, it was noon.\n\nShen Lingdong stopped and asked the other two, \"Are you hungry?\"\n\n\"I'm okay, are you hungry?\"\n\n\"Let's take a break. There's bread and milk in the car. I'll go get it for you.\" Saying this, Shen Lingdong walked outside.\n\nWang Jizhong and Zheng Daoguang sat down on the ground.\n\nA moment later, Shen Lingdong came back in carrying a bag. He distributed the bread and milk to Zheng Daoguang and Wang Jizhong and then sat down beside them.\n\nRubbing his hands, he said, \"This place is really cold. Do you think those people are just bored, running out here in the middle of winter to suffer?\"\n\n\"I heard before that they have electric heating here. When the guests check in tomorrow, it definitely won't be this temperature,\" Wang Jizhong said, looking around.\n\n\"Ah, the thoughts of rich people are even harder to guess than those of murderers.\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded and then said, \"That's why random acts of violence are more difficult to solve than other types of cases. It's because they are completely random, with no patterns to follow.\"\n\n\"There was only one group of guests last month, and the few thousand dollars they earned couldn't cover his expenses. If I remember correctly, it was raining for two days last time too, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" Wang Jizhong recalled.\n\nShen Lingdong turned his head to look outside, then glanced around the villa, and then smiled, \"To be honest, if it were raining or snowing, it would really feel a bit like a 'locked-room mystery'...\"\n\nAfter a simple lunch, the three continued their work.\n\nAt 2 PM, they finally finished all the cleaning tasks, and Shen Lingdong and the others returned to the company.\n\nShen Lingdong had even specially ordered a birthday cake for Old Zheng to give to his wife, considering it a company benefit.\n\nUpon returning to the company, Shen Lingdong saw that everyone else was idle, so he let them off work.\n\nHe stayed behind in the company, and Wang Jizhong also chose to stay.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong said to Wang Jizhong, \"I suddenly feel that Yuhai Mountain Villa is a bit unusual. Should I go and stay there for a night to see what they are up to? Anyway, the intermediary is one of our people now.\"\n\nThe person responsible for the Yuhai Mountain Villa business this time was Shen Lingdong's high school classmate. After he resigned from his previous company, he worked as a cleaner at Shen Lingdong's for a period, and then found a real estate agency to buy a house.\n\nThis time, after Shen Lingdong contacted Wu Anguo, Wu asked Shen Lingdong to help find an intermediary company responsible for the villa's business. Shen Lingdong then introduced this business to Zhang Sibo.\n\nWith Zhang Sibo involved, if Shen Lingdong wanted to stay there for a night, as long as there were vacant rooms, he could sneak in, and even save on the cost.\n\nWang Jizhong pondered for a moment, then looked up and asked Shen Lingdong, \"I have the same feeling, but I don't know what exactly is unusual?\"\n\nShen Lingdong also fell into thought. He couldn't pinpoint it, but he just felt something was not quite right.\n\nNeither of them spoke, and the room fell into silence.\n\nSuddenly, Shen Lingdong's phone rang.\n\nShen Lingdong casually picked up his phone and took a look. Instantly, his expression froze.\n\nThis WeChat message was from that \"director.\"\n\n\"I've come to fulfill my promise.\"\n\nSeeing Shen Lingdong's unusual expression, Wang Jizhong quickly stood up and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"The director said he's here to fulfill his promise?\"\n\n\"Ah...\" Wang Jizhong slowly sat back down in his chair, his expression becoming solemn.\n\n\"At the time, at the Dongcheng Community, there was you, me, Gu Caiwei, Lin Xiangbei, Zhao Xiaofei, some police officers, and Li Hui... But based on my estimation, the probability is higher for you and Gu Caiwei.\" Shen Lingdong paused, checked the time, and then said, \"Brother Wang, why don't you take a few days off work...\"\n\nWang Jizhong frowned and then said, \"There's another problem. The director will find a way to frame you, and...\"\n\n\"I'll drive you home first. Don't go out for the next two days. After dropping you off, it will be closing time, and I'll go pick up Gu Caiwei,\" Shen Lingdong interrupted Wang Jizhong.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of death,\" Wang Jizhong said quickly.\n\n\"Alright, I know. Just follow my arrangement.\" Shen Lingdong gently pushed Wang Jizhong, signaling him to leave quickly and go home.\n\nShen Lingdong put on his jacket and drove Wang Jizhong home. Wang Jizhong remained silent the entire way, lost in thought.\n\nAfter dropping Wang Jizhong off, Shen Lingdong hurried to the police station.\n\nIt was only 5:30 PM when he arrived at the police station. Shen Lingdong quickly took out his phone and sent Li Hui a WeChat message, telling him to be careful for the next two days.\n\nAt 6 PM, Gu Caiwei walked out from the entrance. Shen Lingdong quickly went to greet her.\n\nGu Caiwei smiled slightly at Shen Lingdong and said, \"Why are you picking me up again today? What excuse are you going to use?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head slightly and said, \"Nothing, I just came to pick you up.\"\n\nSeeing Shen Lingdong's serious expression, Gu Caiwei quickly asked, \"What happened?\"\n\nShen Lingdong didn't reply to Gu Caiwei. He looked back at his car and then said, \"Get in the car first, and I'll tell you then.\"\n\nOnce they were in the car, Gu Caiwei urgently asked, \"What exactly happened?\"\n\n\"Avoid going out for field work for the next two days. Stay at the police station as much as possible. I'll pick you up to and from work,\" Shen Lingdong said while driving.\n\n\"What exactly happened?\"\n\n\"That 'director,' he might have returned to Dongjiang City. My fingerprints were found on the double-sided tape at the murder scene in the Sanli Taohua Community last time. He sent me a video to prove my innocence, but if I give this video to the police, he will target the people who were present in that community on the day Li Hui left the Dongcheng Community, and he will frame me.\"\n\n\"So... you're worried about me?\" Gu Caiwei wasn't nervous; instead, there was a hint of delight.\n\nShen Lingdong slightly turned his head to look at Gu Caiwei, then nodded and said, \"I'm worried about you, and I'm worried about others too. But others have a certain ability to protect themselves. Even though your skills are much stronger than ordinary people, you are ultimately a woman. If you encounter a criminal, I worry...\"\n\n\"He dares to make a move against police officers?\"\n\n\"Who knows what he's capable of doing?\" Shen Lingdong sighed.\n\nSoon, Shen Lingdong dropped Gu Caiwei off at her home and personally escorted her upstairs. He also instructed her to avoid contact with anyone else, including food delivery personnel, unless it was her family...\n\nAfterward, Shen Lingdong returned to his car. He didn't leave but stayed in the car, outside their residential complex.\n\nUntil the next day...\n\nThe next day, after dropping Gu Caiwei back at the police station, he went to his company. As soon as he entered his office, he saw Wang Jizhong standing in front of the whiteboard, lost in thought.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and said to Wang Jizhong, \"Didn't I tell you to stay at home? Why are you back at the company?\"\n\n\"I can be a coward and let them not find me. This way, they will choose other targets. It would be best if no one gets hurt. But if someone has to get hurt, I hope it's me. If it's me, I'll try to leave you some clues before I die, and only you will be able to find them. I don't even trust Lin Xiangbei; I only trust you. We've worked together for so long, I believe we have that tacit understanding, right?\"\n\n\"No, no, absolutely not.\" Shen Lingdong quickly shook his head.\n\nWang Jizhong turned around, looked at Shen Lingdong, and then pushed him into a chair, saying, \"Please believe me too.\"\n\nWith that, Wang Jizhong took out a cigarette case from his pocket, lit a cigarette, held it between his fingers, and slowly began to speak, \"Do you know why I never got married?\"\n\nShen Lingdong remained silent.\n\nWang Jizhong flicked the ash and continued, \"About twenty years ago, my fiancée was murdered, the day after our engagement. Over the years, I've sent criminals to prison one by one and solved many cases, but my wife's case has never been solved. At the time, I had a copy of the killer's medical report; he had cancer. So much time has passed, and I know the possibility of solving this case is almost zero. The killer might have died long ago.\"\n\n\"For many years, I took care of her parents as if they were my own. A few years ago, I had a dream. I dreamed that my fiancée told me that her parents had never traveled in this lifetime and wanted me to take them out to see the world. So, I quit my job and took them around the country.\"\n\n\"A year ago, her parents passed away, and I lived alone at home in a daze. My life had no goals. I thought about ending it all, but I always felt that some things were unfinished.\"\n\n\"A while ago, I dreamed of my wife again. She said she was taking good care of my parents below, and the four elders got along very well, but she missed her grandchildren...\"\n\nWang Jizhong flicked the ash and then wiped the corners of his eyes, saying, \"I know you're going to say that I'm a police officer, how can I believe these things? When a person is powerless, they always hope for an external force to help them, right? Haha, don't you think so?\"\n\nShen Lingdong slowly said, \"This might be due to your guilt from not solving the case, causing you to blame yourself entirely. Your memory might also change. This is the Mandela effect... If something happens to me because of your actions, I will also feel guilty.\"\n\n\"Let me find release.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\" Shen Lingdong shook his head.\n\nWang Jizhong smiled slightly and then said, \"This will be my last lesson. From the moment you and I started talking about this matter, have you noticed anything unusual?\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly, suddenly feeling a wave of dizziness.\n\nWang Jizhong, though he had lit a cigarette, didn't seem to have taken a single puff...\n\nBut, it was too late.\n\nWith a thud, Shen Lingdong collapsed onto the desk, falling unconscious.\n\nWang Jizhong extinguished the cigarette butt, opened the window for ventilation, and then removed two pieces of cotton from his nose, throwing them into the ashtray. He turned and walked out of the office.\n\nHe didn't know where he was going or what he was going to do...\n\nHowever, as long as he ensured he was always alone, he thought this, took out a cigarette from his cigarette case, took a deep drag, and walked into a small alley without looking back.\n\nHis figure quickly disappeared into the vast expanse of falling snow.\n\n...\n\nAfter an unknown period of time, Shen Lingdong felt a chill on his neck.\n\nThe next moment, he suddenly woke up.\n\nHe touched his neck. The open window had allowed the snow to blow into the room, and some had gotten into his collar.\n\n\"Achoo.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sneezed and quickly got up to close the window.\n\nLeaving the window open in the middle of winter had made him freezing.\n\n7017k",

    "content": "Dongjiang City Criminal Investigation Team.\n\nSnowflakes were still falling from the sky.\n\nAlthough snow removal had been done, some areas were still very slippery, and vehicles were driving cautiously.\n\nThe Criminal Investigation Team finished work early today. Zhao Xiaofei packed up his things and prepared to leave.\n\nJust as he walked out of the police station, he saw Liao Jia in front of him. Zhao Xiaofei quickened his pace and caught up with Liao Jia, \"Liao Jia, wait a moment.\"\n\nLiao Jia stopped and looked at Zhao Xiaofei, asking softly, \"What's up?\"\n\n\"Uh... I happen to be going your way to take care of some business. I'm taking a taxi, why don't we go together?\"\n\n\"No need, I'm taking the subway back.\"\n\n\"Then I'll take the subway too.\" Zhao Xiaofei followed Liao Jia with a dejected air.\n\nWhen they reached the traffic intersection ahead, Liao Jia stopped to wait for the traffic light. Zhao Xiaofei sidled up to her again, just about to speak.\n\nBeside him, Liao Jia took out her earphones, put them on, and then lowered her head to fiddle with her phone.\n\nZhao Xiaofei swallowed his words.\n\nJust then, a black car on the opposite side ran a red light. While trying to avoid a car from the side, it skidded and slid towards Zhao Xiaofei and Liao Jia.\n\n\"Watch out!\" Zhao Xiaofei's eyes were quick, and he quickly pushed Liao Jia aside. His shout also alerted several passersby nearby, who immediately dodged to the side.\n\nBang!\n\nWith a loud noise, Zhao Xiaofei was thrown five or six meters away. Everyone else was fine and uninjured.\n\nSeeing this, the driver quickly opened the car door, got out, ran through the intersection, and fled into the distance.\n\nLiao Jia rushed over to Zhao Xiaofei, then quickly took out her phone and dialed 120. Police officers not far away also rushed over. Upon learning that the driver had fled, they immediately called the Criminal Investigation Team.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei lay in the snow, his face covered in blood. The snow on the ground was also stained red with his blood.\n\nLiao Jia anxiously checked Zhao Xiaofei's injuries, repeatedly calling his name, trying to keep him conscious.\n\nZhao Xiaofei slowly raised his right hand, holding two vouchers, and said weakly, \"I was going to treat you to a meal...\"\n\n\"Don't say it, don't say it. The ambulance will be here soon...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry... for making the relationship between us so awkward,\" Zhao Xiaofei said softly.\n\n\"Don't say it, don't talk for now...\"\n\nJust then, several police officers surrounded them to check Zhao Xiaofei's injuries. Several police cars also departed from the Criminal Investigation Team to pursue the hit-and-run driver.\n\nBefore long, the ambulance arrived and took Zhao Xiaofei to the vehicle. Liao Jia, worried, also got in.\n\nAt this time, Zhao Xiaofei slowly began to speak, \"I still remember your smile during military training. I wanted to get your attention. I know I don't have the kind of looks that stand out from the crowd, and my grades aren't the best. I'm too ordinary. I know I'm not as outstanding as Shen Lingdong. I'm too ordinary, and I didn't dare to confess my feelings.\"\n\n\"So, I set Shen Lingdong as my goal and vowed to surpass him in every way. To get your attention, whenever you walked past the basketball court, I felt extra motivated. I also tried my best to find out about your interests. Sometimes, I would also stroll aimlessly under your dormitory building, just to have a chance encounter with you.\"\n\n\"The whole school knew I liked you, only you didn't. Later, I heard you seemed to be in a relationship, and I thought I had no chance, so I found a girlfriend, but we broke up not long after. After graduation, I came to the Criminal Investigation Team. When I learned you didn't have a boyfriend, you can't imagine how happy I was, but I didn't know how to speak up, for fear of you rejecting me.\"\n\n\"Finally, at the last meeting, I could use someone else's name to say that I liked you. I didn't expect this outcome. I'm sorry...\"\n\nLiao Jia's eyes reddened as she held Zhao Xiaofei's hand and said, \"Don't talk for now, we'll be at the hospital soon.\"\n\n\"I have to say it. If I don't say it now, I'm afraid I won't have another chance.\"\n\nJust then, a doctor beside them said softly, \"You have several fractures in your leg and arm, but there's no danger to your life. Fortunately, the snow on the ground saved you, preventing further injury.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Liao Jia quickly asked.\n\nThe doctor nodded and then said, \"Yes.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei continued, \"In that moment, I thought a lot. Even if I recover, I probably won't be able to continue working at the Criminal Investigation Team. That's fine, it will be less awkward when we meet, and I won't bother you anymore. Life isn't a movie because it's real, nor is it a song because it's mundane, nor is it a game that can be replayed. It's a diary, filled with entries until the pages turn red. Even if you're reluctant, you have to let go.\"\n\n\"You're still in the mood to philosophize at a time like this...\"\n\nSoon, Zhao Xiaofei was taken to the nearest hospital and into the operating room.\n\nLiao Jia waited outside the operating room, not leaving his side.\n\n...\n\nShen Lingdong spent the entire afternoon looking for Wang Jizhong but couldn't find him, unaware of his whereabouts.\n\nJust as he was about to pick up Gu Caiwei, she told him she had to work overtime and wouldn't finish until 7 PM, so Shen Lingdong wasn't in a hurry.\n\nAs it was past 6 PM, Shen Lingdong was about to go to the police station to wait for Gu Caiwei when his phone suddenly rang. It was Gu Caiwei.\n\n\"Hello, did you get off work early? I was just about to head to the Criminal Investigation Team,\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Zhao Xiaofei had an accident... I'm heading there with Captain Lin.\"\n\n\"What happened? Where is he? I'm coming too,\" Shen Lingdong asked urgently.\n\n\"Someone's car skidded and hit Zhao Xiaofei. He's currently at Dongjiang City Central Hospital,\" Gu Caiwei said from the other end of the phone.\n\n\"Okay, I know.\" Shen Lingdong hung up and hurried to the hospital.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, outside the operating room, Liao Jia, Gu Caiwei, Lin Xiangbei, and others were waiting.\n\nShen Lingdong hurried forward and asked, \"Zhao Xiaofei, how is he?\"\n\n\"He has multiple fractures, but his life is not in danger,\" Liao Jia said softly, her composure finally breaking as tears flowed from the corner of her eyes. She choked out, \"He was trying to save me...\"\n\nGu Caiwei sat beside Liao Jia and comforted her by patting her shoulder.\n\n\"Did they catch the hit-and-run driver?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\nLin Xiangbei shook his head slightly, \"He disappeared after running into a shopping mall. We checked the mall's surveillance and saw him enter a restroom and never come out.\"\n\nThen, he walked up to Shen Lingdong and said in a low voice, \"Come with me for a moment.\"\n\nShen Lingdong followed Lin Xiangbei to a spot not far away. Lin Xiangbei asked Shen Lingdong with a grave expression, \"A year ago, Zhao Xiaofei arrested a thief and sent him to prison. Zhao Xiaofei handled that case alone. Recently, that thief was released. The hit-and-run driver is that thief, named Qiao Yong. Do you think this has anything to do with the Director?\"\n\n\"What did Qiao Yong say?\"\n\n\"He didn't mention the Director, insisting it was due to the slippery road that caused the vehicle to skid,\" Lin Xiangbei said softly.\n\n\"Regardless of whether there's a connection, we can't let our guard down. Is Old Wang still out there?\"\n\n\"He told me. I've also sent people to look for him, but Old Wang is a bit stubborn. Once he sets his mind on something, no one can change his opinion,\" Lin Xiangbei sighed.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then took out his phone and sent Wang Jizhong a WeChat message, informing him that Zhao Xiaofei had been in an accident.\n\nNot long after, Shen Lingdong's phone suddenly rang. Thinking it was Wang Jizhong replying, he quickly picked up his phone to check.\n\nTo his surprise, it was from \"Director.\"\n\n\"How is it? I kept my promise. But this is just the first scene, to be continued.\"\n\nShen Lingdong showed the WeChat message to Lin Xiangbei, then replied to the Director, saying, \"If you have something, come at me. Don't hurt my friends.\"\n\n\"Your scene is coming up soon, don't be impatient.\"\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong tried to message him again, the message failed to send. Every time they finished talking, the Director would block him.\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately said to Shen Lingdong, \"I'm going back to the precinct. You watch things here. I'll send someone over to guard later.\"\n\nAfter Lin Xiangbei left, Shen Lingdong anxiously paced in front of the operating room door. He felt he had let Zhao Xiaofei down. If it weren't for his own issues, Zhao Xiaofei wouldn't have had the accident.\n\nThree hours later, Zhao Xiaofei was wheeled out. However, due to the general anesthesia, he couldn't open his eyes yet and lay motionless on the bed.\n\nThe doctor instructed Shen Lingdong and the others, \"The patient hasn't fully recovered from the anesthesia yet and is in a semi-conscious state. He should be more awake in about three hours. At that time, you can feed him some liquid food, like porridge or milk.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Uh... can one of you handle the hospital admission procedures and pay the fees?\"\n\n\"I'll do it,\" Shen Lingdong said, preparing to go downstairs.\n\n\"Shen Lingdong, let me do it. He saved me... This way, I'll feel a little better.\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" Shen Lingdong said, then walked downstairs.\n\nHalf an hour later, Shen Lingdong returned upstairs, having bought some food to share with Gu Caiwei and Liao Jia, as well as some daily necessities like towels, washbasins, and hot water cups.\n\nHe then said to Liao Jia and Gu Caiwei, \"Why don't you two go back first? I'll take care of Zhao Xiaofei.\"\n\n\"I don't want to go back,\" Liao Jia said with red eyes.\n\n\"It's not convenient for you, a girl, to take care of Zhao Xiaofei. What if he needs to go to the restroom or something?\"\n\n\"There are male police officers outside,\" Liao Jia said to Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"Never mind, let's all stay here. I'll go get some hot water.\"\n\nShen Lingdong went to the water room. While waiting for the water to boil, he went to the restroom to use the toilet.\n\nJust then, a cleaning uncle came in, brushed the toilet with toilet cleaner, and then took a beverage bottle from the washbasin cabinet, which contained some liquid.\n\n\"Is that 84 disinfectant?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" the cleaning uncle nodded.\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Toilet cleaner and disinfectant should not be mixed. It can produce chlorine gas and cause poisoning.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I haven't seen anyone poisoned since I started working here!\"\n\n\"Because it was summer before, and those windows were open for good ventilation, which might have caused some coughing or chest tightness. But now the windows are closed and ventilation is poor. Inhaling too much chlorine gas can lead to pulmonary congestion and edema, causing difficulty breathing, or even death.\"\n\nThe cleaning uncle looked at the bottle in his hand and asked with confusion, \"Really?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\n\"No wonder I've been coughing so much. My wife even told me to quit smoking.\"\n\n\"However, quitting smoking is indeed beneficial, and smoking isn't allowed in hospitals anyway.\"\n\n\"That's just for show. Many people smoke in the corridors on the top floor.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Shen Lingdong responded softly, then continued, \"The water is boiling. I'll go get it now, Uncle.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nShen Lingdong got a cup of hot water and then returned to the ward.\n\n...\n\nIn the blink of an eye, it was close to midnight. Zhao Xiaofei finally opened his eyes, looked at the people in front of him, and then asked, \"Are you all dead too?\"\n\nShen Lingdong, who had intended to praise Zhao Xiaofei, felt like punching him after hearing that.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" Liao Jia asked quickly.\n\n\"It hurts...\"\n\n\"The anesthesia has just worn off. Are you hungry? Want something to eat?\"\n\nLiao Jia opened the insulated lunch box beside her, scooped a spoonful of porridge, and brought it to Zhao Xiaofei's mouth.\n\n\"I could hear everything you were saying just now, and I could talk, but I just couldn't be bothered. I wanted to hear what you were saying about me behind my back. Who was it that praised my literary talent just now?\" Although Zhao Xiaofei's body was immobile, his mental state seemed quite good.\n\nShen Lingdong snorted and said, \"Alright, Mr. Poet, stop talking and rest well.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect you all to think so highly of me.\"\n\n\"Talk less. Eating porridge won't shut you up,\" Liao Jia said, feeding Zhao Xiaofei another spoonful of porridge.\n\nZhao Xiaofei leaned back on his pillow and looked at the ceiling, saying, \"It would be great if it could be like this all the time.\"\n\nAfter eating, they chatted for a bit longer, and then Zhao Xiaofei fell asleep again.\n\nIt was already close to 1:30 AM. Gu Caiwei had fallen asleep in a chair beside him, while Liao Jia had fallen asleep with her head resting on the hospital bed.\n\nShen Lingdong couldn't sleep.\n\nHe quietly went to the corridor and sat on the stairs, thinking about the \"Director.\"\n\nWhy would he target his friends?\n\nWhile there had been some initial unpleasantness in his interactions with Zhao Xiaofei, as they got to know each other better, Shen Lingdong had become accustomed to Zhao Xiaofei providing clues while he was cleaning up crime scenes.\n\nCurrently, Shen Lingdong didn't have many friends, and Zhao Xiaofei had become an important figure among his few companions.\n\nNow that he had been injured, Shen Lingdong, in addition to feeling guilty, also secretly vowed to catch the \"Director.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stood up and paced up and down the stairs, recalling all the clues related to the \"Director.\"\n\nWithout realizing it, Shen Lingdong found himself on the stairs to the top floor.\n\nAlthough he couldn't see any cigarette butts on the ground, he could smell the strong scent of smoke filling the area.\n\nHe looked at the two doors leading to the rooftop, both locked. He glanced through the window at the rooftop and saw nothing unusual, then returned to Zhao Xiaofei's ward.",

    "content": "It was Zhao Xiaofei's fourth day in the hospital.\n\nAfter several days of snow, it stopped abruptly yesterday, and today the temperature was unusually high.\n\nBy noon, the melted snow had formed a small river on the road in front of the hospital, flowing into the sewer.\n\nTo take care of Zhao Xiaofei, Liao Jia had taken several days off. For these days, she and Shen Lingdong had been primarily taking care of Zhao Xiaofei. In the evenings, Gu Caiwei would also come over for a while.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong was holding food and preparing to relieve Liao Jia.\n\nShen Lingdong stood in the hospital courtyard, glanced at the small river, and paused. He picked up a hundred-yuan bill from the gaps in the sewer grate. After looking around, he walked towards the ward.\n\nZhao Xiaofei was in good spirits, chatting and laughing with Liao Jia. Seeing Shen Lingdong enter, he was about to speak to him but suddenly noticed something unusual about Shen Lingdong's expression. He stopped smiling and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\nShen Lingdong put on a stern face, placed the food on the table, and shook his head, saying, \"Nothing. I just found a hundred yuan.\"\n\n\"Here, give it to the police uncle,\" Zhao Xiaofei said, raising the hand that was in a cast.\n\nShen Lingdong took out the hundred-yuan bill from his pocket and placed it in Zhao Xiaofei's hand. A thin red string was tied to the bill.\n\nLiao Jia picked up the hundred-yuan bill and asked, \"What does it mean to tie a red string around it?\"\n\nAs she spoke, she untied the red string. Inside, three more bills were rolled up: a five-yuan bill and two one-yuan bills. Furthermore, the hundred-yuan bill was fake.\n\nTucked within the banknotes was a piece of paper with some writing on it, but the characters were blurred and illegible due to being soaked in water.\n\n\"There's a piece of paper here, what does it say?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Shen Lingdong blinked slightly, then leaned closer to examine it. It seemed to be four characters, but he couldn't make them out clearly. He then returned the slip of paper to Liao Jia.\n\n\"How strange,\" Liao Jia said, holding up the paper and looking out the window. \"Could it be some kind of superstition?\"\n\n\"We'll know if we ask,\" Shen Lingdong said, pulling out his phone and calling Zheng Daoguang. \"I found money in the hospital, and there was a note with it. I can't make out what it says. Do you know what it means?\"\n\n\"107 yuan?\" Zheng Daoguang asked.\n\n\"Yes, how did you know?\" Shen Lingdong retorted.\n\n\"Hurry and throw it away! The note says 'Borrow Life for Seven Days.' The hundred yuan is to bribe ghost messengers, and the seven yuan is to buy the lifespan of a living person.\"\n\n\"Superstition,\" Shen Lingdong scoffed.\n\n\"Oh, for crying out loud! You don't believe this stuff, so why ask me? Wait, what are you doing at the hospital?\"\n\n\"Oh, Zhao Xiaofei is hospitalized. I just found it at the hospital entrance when I arrived.\"\n\n\"At the hospital, there are always people who find out they have some terminal illness. To keep the patient alive, some people use this method to extend their life. This trick is harmful and not well-intentioned. Is there a bloody handprint on it? Some people even press a bloody handprint on it.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Oh, just throw it away, don't keep it.\"\n\n\"Okay, I got it.\"\n\n\"Throw it away, don't keep it,\" Zheng Daoguang urged again.\n\nShen Lingdong hung up the phone, his expression solemn as he looked at Zhao Xiaofei and Liao Jia. Zheng Daoguang's words had sent chills down their spines.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Shen Lingdong took out a sealed bag from his pocket, placed the banknotes and the slip of paper inside, and said, \"I'll still hand it over to Lin Xiangbei later.\"\n\nLiao Jia looked at Shen Lingdong and asked, \"Shen Lingdong, why do you carry this stuff with you?\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately replied, \"Gloves, shoe covers, sealed bags, and cotton swabs – I carry them with me at all times, just in case.\"\n\nSuddenly, Shen Lingdong frowned, looked at Liao Jia, and then asked doubtfully, \"It's a bit strange to hear you call me by my name directly...\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei chuckled softly at this.\n\n\"By the way, what were you going to tell me earlier?\" Shen Lingdong asked Zhao Xiaofei.\n\n\"This... Liao Jia has a new significant other...\" Zhao Xiaofei slowly took Liao Jia's hand.\n\n\"Oh?\" Shen Lingdong raised an eyebrow and looked at Zhao Xiaofei and Liao Jia with surprise. \"When did this happen? Does Gu Caiwei know about this?\"\n\n\"I haven't had a chance to tell her yet,\" Liao Jia said with a shy smile.\n\n\"That's great news! Once you're recovered, I'll treat you to a meal,\" Shen Lingdong said to them.\n\n\"It's not easy to get Shen Lingdong to treat you to a meal...\"\n\nThe sudden good news dispelled the eerie atmosphere. After chatting for a while longer, Liao Jia also went back to rest.\n\nShen Lingdong stayed with Zhao Xiaofei all night. The next morning, as he was about to leave, he had just stepped out of the hospital gate when he heard a \"crack\" and saw pieces of ice shards rolling to his feet.\n\nShen Lingdong looked up. Several icicles were hanging precariously from the eaves of the hospital's rooftop.\n\nDue to the rising temperature today, they were already on the verge of falling.\n\n\"This is too dangerous.\"\n\nShen Lingdong muttered to himself and prepared to report this to the security guard at the entrance. As he was leaving, he glanced up and almost saw the culprit that would have led to his demise at the age of 25.\n\nSuddenly, Shen Lingdong stopped, crouched down, and carefully examined the broken ice shards at his feet.\n\nThis piece of ice was different from normal ice; it was red.\n\nHe checked the other pieces of ice, and most of them had a faint red hue. Not far away, a section of ice was bright red.\n\nShen Lingdong looked up again, then returned to the hospital and took the elevator directly to the top floor, then proceeded via the stairs to the rooftop.\n\nThe door leading to the rooftop was still locked, just as it had been when he last saw it.\n\nHe glanced inside through the window on the door, and Shen Lingdong's body stiffened. In the center of the rooftop lay a corpse. Judging by its clothing, it appeared to be a male.\n\nAround the body, there were patches of frozen blood, slowly melting.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly took out his phone and dialed Lin Xiangbei's number...\n\nBefore long, Lin Xiangbei arrived at the hospital with his team. After asking the hospital administrator to open the two doors leading to the rooftop, they began their investigation.\n\nShen Lingdong stood at the doorway, watching the police officers examine the surroundings.\n\nAround the hospital, there was a wire fence nearly two meters high, with no signs of damage. The only way to access the rooftop was through the door, which was locked, and only the hospital administrator had the key...\n\nLin Xiangbei approached the body. When he saw the victim's face clearly, he was shocked. He then looked at the officer next to him and asked, \"Qiao Yong?\"\n\nThe officer next to him was also startled and quickly said, \"The driver who hit Brother Fei?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded, then turned to Liang Yinxi and said, \"Sister Xi, check the time of death for this person.\"\n\nLiang Yinxi went to the body and performed a preliminary examination. \"The body has multiple stab wounds, and several major arteries have been severed. The body has been frozen, making it temporarily impossible to determine the time of death. It needs to be thawed and further examined.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded.\n\nLiang Yinxi gently lifted the deceased's waist to check underneath the body and continued, \"On the ground beneath the body, some unmelted snow was found. Judging by the depth of the snow, the deceased likely appeared here four to five days ago.\"\n\n\"Four to five days?\" Lin Xiangbei frowned, then said, \"On the evening of the 20th, at 18:23, he was driving a black car and had a traffic accident at the intersection of Nanhe Road and Beiqing Street, causing Zhao Xiaofei's injury. He then got out of the car and fled to the second-floor restroom of the Cultural Mall, where he disappeared. According to eyewitness descriptions and surveillance footage from the traffic intersection and the mall, it can be confirmed that the perpetrator was indeed Qiao Yong. So, his time of death would be between the evening of the 20th and the 21st?\"\n\nLiang Yinxi replied, \"If this is indeed Qiao Yong, then yes, that's correct.\"\n\n\"In this environment, can you still determine an accurate time of death?\"\n\n\"Fortunately, it was discovered in time. The temperature rose yesterday, and some thawing might have occurred on the surface of the body, but it won't affect the autopsy results. If it were another day, the impact could have been much greater.\"\n\n\"That's good. Thank you, Sister Xi.\"\n\nAt this moment, Sister Xi's gaze fell upon the victim's hands. His palms were stained with a red substance. Sister Xi frowned, then said, \"There's a red substance on the deceased's hands. It doesn't look like blood. It seems to be some kind of pigment that stained his palms after getting wet.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei looked around but couldn't find what Sister Xi was referring to.\n\nJust then, Shen Lingdong suddenly spoke up from the side, \"The item should be with Zhao Xiaofei?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, then went to Shen Lingdong's side and asked softly, \"What item?\"\n\n\"Hell money,\" Shen Lingdong said. \"Yesterday afternoon, I found 107 yuan in the gap of the sewer grate at the hospital. Later, I discovered that the hundred-yuan bill was hell money, tied with a red string. There's a saying that this means 'borrowing life for seven days'.\"\n\n\"Where is the item?\"\n\n\"I think Liao Jia put it in the bottom drawer of Zhao Xiaofei's bedside cabinet.\"\n\n\"Take me to see it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong led Lin Xiangbei to Zhao Xiaofei's ward.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei had just woken up. Seeing Lin Xiangbei, he smiled slightly and said, \"Boss, you've come to see me.\"\n\n\"Rest well,\" Lin Xiangbei said, pausing for a moment before nodding. He then turned to Shen Lingdong and asked, \"Where is the item?\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately took out the sealed bag from the drawer and handed it to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nAt this point, Liao Jia and Zhao Xiaofei realized that Lin Xiangbei wasn't there to visit Zhao Xiaofei; something must have happened. Their expressions immediately turned serious.\n\nLiao Jia asked, \"Team Leader Lin, what's wrong?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at Liao Jia and then said, \"Your vacation is over. Report back to duty immediately. I'll have someone else cover your position.\"\n\n\"Yes, Team Leader Lin,\" Liao Jia replied and began packing her things.\n\nJust then, a man in his fifties wearing a white coat knocked on the door and asked Lin Xiangbei, \"Hello, are you Officer Lin?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei turned around to look at the man and asked, \"You are...\"\n\n\"My surname is Lin. I'm the director of this hospital.\"\n\n\"Oh, Director Lin. I was just about to look for you, but you're here first. Is there anything you need?\"\n\n\"Someone downstairs found red ice chunks earlier. Since you police officers are here, he's started spreading rumors that there's a murder case in the hospital.\"\n\n\"Isn't that normal in a hospital?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the weather has been unusual these past few days. If bloody water is flowing down from the rooftop, it's bound to cause panic. So, I wanted to ask when we can clear the rooftop.\" Director Lin said with a troubled expression.\n\n\"Oh, this matter. There's already a document from upstairs stating that crime scenes must be cleared by specialized personnel. However, this murder case is indeed quite unusual. How about this, we'll collect evidence first, and then we'll have a meeting to discuss whether to unseal it early.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Officer Lin,\" Director Lin said, bowing his head.\n\nLin Xiangbei waved his hand and then asked, \"Are the keys to the doors leading to the rooftop kept by only one person?\"\n\n\"It should be managed by the logistics department.\"\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong inquired, \"Since there are two doors to the rooftop, and both are locked, no one should have forced their way onto the rooftop. Why is there still a protective net on the rooftop? Is it to prevent entry from the outside of the building?\"\n\nDirector Lin sighed helplessly and said, \"Our hospital's pediatrics department is quite famous. If it were a matter of exchanging one life for another, the rooftop would be filled with the mothers of children...\"\n\nShen Lingdong's body stiffened.\n\nDirector Lin continued, \"There are also people who are terminally ill and have thoughts of suicide. We can only use various methods to prevent such incidents from happening.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei then said, \"In other words, the only way to get onto the rooftop is through that door, correct?\"\n\nDirector Lin nodded. \"We've done a very good job of this. Except for maintenance work, the door to the rooftop is usually not opened. A few years ago, someone tried to force the door open, but the lock was very strong and couldn't be broken. They were eventually stopped by our security personnel. I can guarantee that without the key, no one can get onto the rooftop.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at Lin Xiangbei and said softly, \"So, under those circumstances, the only way to reach the rooftop would be from above.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, pondered for a moment, and then said to the director, \"Take me to the monitoring room. I want all the surveillance footage from the 20th to the 21st of the top-floor hallways and elevators.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nShen Lingdong swallowed hard and then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"I went to the top-floor stairwell at around 2 AM on the 21st.\"\n\nAt this moment, Liao Jia looked at Shen Lingdong with a face full of confusion. \"Why did you go up there?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at Liao Jia, then at Shen Lingdong, and then asked, \"Did you discover anything?\"\n\n\"I looked inside at the time, but I didn't see anything, nor did I see a body.\"",

    "content": "Shen Lingdong got into the van. Just as he was about to start the engine, the passenger door opened, and Wang Jizhong smoothly slid into the car without any hesitation.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly. He wasn't entirely keen on Wang Jizhong accompanying him.\n\nHe felt like a startled bird. The company was undergoing renovations, and he was afraid the \"director\" might have sent someone to infiltrate the construction crew to secretly install something.\n\nAt the same time, he wanted someone to keep a constant eye on Yuan Yuan's behavior.\n\nWhen one begins to suspect someone, everything they do seems suspicious.\n\nWang Jizhong seemed to sense Shen Lingdong's doubts and added, \"Old Zheng just arrived. He's watching from upstairs. He's in charge of the Feng Shui aspects.\"\n\nShen Lingdong didn't say anything, then explained the surveillance camera issue in detail to Wang Jizhong.\n\nWang Jizhong turned his head to look at Yuan Yuan by the door, his brow furrowed. \"This girl... it shouldn't be her. But if you want to keep an eye on him, there's someone more suitable than me.\"\n\n\"Who?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\nEven though he didn't know Wang Jizhong's previous position in the police force, Shen Lingdong could tell that even in retirement, he still had considerable influence within the criminal investigation team. In terms of investigative ability, Shen Lingdong couldn't think of anyone more suitable for tailing Yuan Yuan.\n\nWang Jizhong chuckled and said, \"Your mom.\"\n\nShen Lingdong burst out laughing.\n\nIndeed, when it came to investigating young women, a mother's capabilities were comparable to Sherlock Holmes, hearing from all sides and seeing everywhere.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then sent a WeChat message to Li Xianglan: \"I heard Yuan Yuan has a boyfriend?\"\n\nLi Xianglan: \"No?\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Why are you suddenly asking me this?\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you have feelings for Yuan Yuan. I already told her to create more opportunities for you two to be alone, like last time when you both went to do cleaning.\"\n\n\"However, Yuan Yuan is so beautiful, there must be many boys chasing her. I haven't paid special attention to this matter recently.\"\n\n\"I'm arriving at the company soon. Mom will help you gather some information.\"\n\nHis mother's voice messages arrived like artillery shells.\n\n\"Got it.\" Shen Lingdong smiled, put away his phone, and slowly started the car.\n\nWang Jizhong fastened his seatbelt and asked Shen Lingdong, \"Where are you going to catch the culprit?\"\n\n\"Xingfu Nursing Home.\"\n\n\"Should we notify the police? You're quite famous online now. If there are any repercussions, it won't be good for you and the company,\" Wang Jizhong advised.\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and replied, \"I'm just going to visit some lonely elderly people. How would that be bad for me?\"\n\nWang Jizhong turned his head and looked at Shen Lingdong. He was increasingly unable to understand this young man, not knowing what was going on in his mind.\n\nWhen they passed a fruit shop, Shen Lingdong bought a large pile of fruit.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong arrived at Xingfu Nursing Home, it was just after lunch. It should have been time for a walk, but there were very few people in the courtyard.\n\nUpon reaching the entrance, the security guard greeted Shen Lingdong familiarly. \"Brother Shen is here again. After Xiao Qiu, who used to come often, stopped coming, you've been visiting frequently. But you've come at the wrong time today!\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly and casually asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"This morning, several elderly residents were found missing. Now, one of the elderly residents' children is making a scene.\"\n\n\"Several elderly residents?\" Shen Lingdong retorted.\n\n\"Well, it has nothing to do with me. They didn't leave from my watch,\" the security guard said with a relieved smile, then his gaze fell on the bags in Shen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong's hands and he asked, \"What have you got there?\"\n\n\"Bought some fruit for the grandpas and grandmas.\"\n\nThe security guard stepped forward, tugged at the bag, took out an apple, rubbed it on his sleeve, and took a bite with a crunch. He then asked vaguely, \"How much did you buy?\"\n\n\"There are several more bags in the car,\" Shen Lingdong said, glancing back at his van.\n\n\"You probably won't be able to deliver them. Why don't you leave them with me for now?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, placed the bag in his hand on the ground, and then asked, \"Which elderly residents are missing?\"\n\nThe security guard shook his head slightly.\n\nWang Jizhong also walked up to the security guard with two bags of fruit and placed them on the ground.\n\nThe security guard looked down, then took out his phone, entered a WeChat group, scrolled for a bit, and then handed the phone to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the list of missing persons. There were five in total: two men and three women, including Zhao Guilan. The two elderly men were Yu Xingrong, one of the seven suspicious elderly men Shen Lingdong had sent to Zhao Xiaofei, and Grandpa Lu Guisen, who had Alzheimer's and had moved into Zhao Guifang's former room.\n\n\"This Zhao Guilan... I didn't see her that day?\"\n\n\"I'm also puzzled. Wasn't she in a coma the whole time? How did she suddenly go missing?\"\n\n\"Are you very familiar with them?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the security guard said confidently.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then asked the security guard, \"I just saw in your group chat that there's a reward for finding the missing elderly residents, right?\"\n\nThe security guard nodded.\n\nShen Lingdong mysteriously took out his phone. \"I have something here, I'll just show you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Shen Lingdong found a video screenshot he had gotten from Brother Wei next door to his company and handed it to the security guard. \"I saw someone post a surveillance screenshot on their Moments. It seems to be a lost elderly person. Can you help me see if it's from here?\"\n\nThe security guard examined the photo. Although it was only a figure from behind in the screenshot, a look of surprise appeared on his face. \"Where did you see this? This is our director's father. The director said there's a reward of one million yuan for finding his father!\"\n\n\"Your director's father?\" Shen Lingdong was slightly surprised.\n\n\"This is him, Grandpa Lu Guisen,\" the security guard said, pointing to the list of missing persons on his phone.\n\n\"Doesn't he have Alzheimer's?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's been more than ten years. Our director founded this nursing home specifically for his father. And he's not short of money; this nursing home is basically a charity.\"\n\n\"What did Grandpa Lu Guisen do for a living before?\"\n\n\"He was a director. His past works are still collected in the activity room,\" the security guard said.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, looked around the nursing home, and then said, \"Since they're not letting us in, we'll leave for now.\"\n\nShen Lingdong turned and left.\n\n\"Hey! You haven't told me where that photo was taken!\"\n\nShen Lingdong had already gotten into the car.\n\nWang Jizhong then picked up the fruit bags from the ground and also left.\n\n\"Why are you taking this too?\" the security guard shouted from behind.\n\nWang Jizhong turned back. \"When you knew those elderly residents didn't leave from your watch, and you had that gloating look on your face... I wouldn't even feed these fruits to the monkeys in the zoo. Giving you an apple is already being generous.\"",

    "content": "Lin Xiangbei quickly brought people to the hospital. After understanding the situation, on one hand, he organized his team to search, and on the other hand, he began to investigate the hospital's surveillance. Tang Feng was in charge of investigating the surveillance.\n\nAt 11:03 AM, a man in a protective suit appeared in front of Zhao Xiaofei's ward. He seemed to be collecting garbage. After staying for nearly five minutes, he pushed the trash can and left, then took the elevator away.\n\nAfter leaving the hospital building, he pushed the trash can to the hospital's back door. Finally, he pushed the trash can to a blind spot in the surveillance, and his image was no longer captured by the surveillance cameras.\n\nAt this time, Lin Xiangbei was asking Shen Lingdong for information.\n\nShen Lingdong reported the situation truthfully to Lin Xiangbei. He arrived at the hospital at 8:30 AM and stayed in Zhao Xiaofei's ward for less than ten minutes. He then went to the rooftop to clean. Since there wasn't much to clean on the rooftop, Shen Lingdong planned to handle Zhao Xiaofei's discharge procedures after finishing the cleaning.\n\nDuring the cleaning process, there was a lot of crushed ice. The few of them used trash cans to transport the crushed ice downstairs. Just as they were about to finish, they received a call from the hospital saying that Zhao Xiaofei was missing.\n\nShen Lingdong also reported the incident to the police immediately.\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Tang Feng approached Lin Xiangbei. He glanced at Shen Lingdong, who was wearing a protective suit, and did not speak.\n\n\"Long time no see,\" Shen Lingdong said softly, greeting him.\n\n\"Captain Lin, in the surveillance video, a suspicious man was found in front of Zhao Xiaofei's room pushing a trash can. It is highly likely that the suspicious man used the trash can to take Zhao Xiaofei out of the room.\" Although Tang Feng was reporting to Lin Xiangbei, his gaze remained fixed on Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong did not speak. Seeing Tang Feng like this, he had already identified him as a suspect.\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and then said, \"Okay, I understand. Go and ask the nearby merchants if they have seen any suspicious vehicles...\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain Lin.\"\n\nAs Tang Feng left, Shen Lingdong asked Lin Xiangbei, \"He suspects me?\"\n\n\"It's fine, no big deal. Give me the body camera you're wearing. Don't tell me you forgot to turn it on,\" Lin Xiangbei said, pointing to Shen Lingdong's chest.\n\n\"It's on, it's on...\" Shen Lingdong quickly took off the body camera and handed it to Lin Xiangbei.\n\n\"I'll take it back to the criminal police team. You can pick it up later,\" Lin Xiangbei said to Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"I want to participate in the investigation,\" Shen Lingdong pleaded with Lin Xiangbei. Although he was not a police officer, he could not stand by and do nothing, especially since Zhao Xiaofei was the one who was missing.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, hesitated for a moment, and then nodded, saying, \"Okay, you'll come with me to the criminal police team later.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nLin Xiangbei then went to attend to other matters. Shen Lingdong asked Lao Zheng and Xu Tao to return to the company and bring the cleaning tools back. He stayed behind to wait for Lin Xiangbei and the others to finish their investigation.\n\nIn the car, Shen Lingdong took out his phone and sent another WeChat message to Wang Jizhong: \"Zhao Xiaofei is missing again.\"\n\nShen Lingdong had sent many messages to Wang Jizhong, but Lao Wang had not replied.\n\nJust as Shen Lingdong was about to put away his phone, his phone suddenly rang. It said, \"I'll be at the criminal police team shortly.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly replied with a \"Good\" text.\n\nAt this time, Lin Xiangbei and the others had finished their investigation. They had already begun to investigate the mysterious person based on the clues they had. Lin Xiangbei and Shen Lingdong drove back to the criminal police team, one after the other.\n\nUpon returning to the criminal police team, Shen Lingdong and Lin Xiangbei went to the conference room. Shortly after, Wang Jizhong also arrived at the criminal police team. Besides the three of them, Director Sun and Gu Caiwei were also in the conference room.\n\nThe five of them sat in the conference room. Director Sun looked at everyone and then slowly said, \"Zhao Xiaofei is one of ours. Now he has been taken from the hospital. This is a disgrace to our police force. I don't care what methods you use, you must find Zhao Xiaofei for me.\"\n\n\"We have already gathered some clues and are investigating,\" Lin Xiangbei quickly said to Director Sun.\n\n\"As soon as possible. Time waits for no one. The longer we waste, the greater the risk to Zhao Xiaofei's life,\" Director Sun said sternly, tapping the table with a solemn expression.\n\nEveryone lowered their heads.\n\nWang Jizhong looked at everyone with a blank expression and then slowly said, \"Let's first figure out their motive for taking Zhao Xiaofei. Is it to frame him, extort him, or retaliate? We can temporarily set aside the case of Qiao Yong's death. Let's look at the entire process from Zhao Xiaofei's car accident to his kidnapping from the hospital. I don't know many details of the case, can someone tell me?\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei slowly spoke, \"After Zhao Xiaofei's accident, I, Shen Lingdong, and Liao Jia had the most contact with Zhao Xiaofei. Let me tell you. On the 20th, at 18:07, Zhao Xiaofei left the criminal police team after work. He originally planned to treat Liao Jia to dinner, but Liao Jia ignored him because of the previous incident. Everyone was present at the time, so I won't repeat it.\"\n\n\"When the car accident happened, Liao Jia was wearing headphones at a traffic intersection, waiting for the traffic light, and did not notice her surroundings. Then, a black car ran a red light. To avoid a car from the side, the black car skidded and crashed towards Liao Jia. We reviewed the surveillance video. Given Zhao Xiaofei's position at the time, that car would not have hit him. He went to save Liao Jia, which led to him being hit by the car.\"\n\nAfter that, there was a homicide in the hospital. The director requested that the rooftop be unsealed and cleaned as soon as possible. After our meeting and discussion, it was decided to unseal it on the morning of the same day, and Shen Lingdong would be responsible for the cleaning. Just as Shen Lingdong was about to finish cleaning, Zhao Xiaofei disappeared. According to the surveillance video investigation, a man in a protective suit entered Zhao Xiaofei's room pushing a trash can. Therefore, we deduced that Zhao Xiaofei might have been taken away in the trash can.\"\n\nWang Jizhong hesitated for a moment and then slowly said, \"In other words, the killer used the special attire of Shen Lingdong entering the hospital to clean during that specific time period. This allowed him to blend into the hospital and take Zhao Xiaofei away without arousing suspicion. Otherwise, at other times, wearing a protective suit would have attracted a lot of attention. But today, no matter who saw him, they would think the suspect was someone from Shen Lingdong's group.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, there is another point of doubt. If Qiao Yong's car accident was also part of the plan, then the injured person should have been Liao Jia, not Zhao Xiaofei. We need to consider this.\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei quickly said, \"Because in the threatening WeChat message Shen Lingdong received last time, the next target of the suspect was clearly stated to be everyone present except Director Sun, and it was mentioned that they would frame Shen Lingdong. Although there are many doubts surrounding Shen Lingdong, there is evidence to prove his innocence in the case. Therefore, I think they took Zhao Xiaofei away likely for their next move.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei's expression was solemn, and Shen Lingdong's face was also gloomy.\n\nBy kidnapping Zhao Xiaofei, they would have ample time to set up the scene and frame Shen Lingdong. Therefore, Zhao Xiaofei's situation was dire.\n\nAt this time, Wang Jizhong slowly said, \"I don't think Zhao Xiaofei will be in trouble.\"\n\nAt this moment, everyone's eyes turned to Wang Jizhong. Wang Jizhong continued, \"I've been at home these past few days. I found a fingerprint on a water glass at my home. I took down the fingerprint and printed it out.\n\nCoincidentally, the next day, Shen Lingdong came to my house. I handed him a glass of water. After he left, I extracted his fingerprint from his cup. After comparison, the two fingerprints matched. Before this, Shen Lingdong had never been to my house. How could his fingerprint appear in my house?\n\nI then inspected my house thoroughly. It was very clean, except for that fingerprint, there were no other traces, as if my house had been cleaned once. However, from the outside, there was nothing unusual. I suspect that the director's real target was me, but Zhao Xiaofei's unexpected car accident caused them to change their plans temporarily.\"\n\n\"These past few days, I have reviewed all the surveillance videos in our neighborhood. Finally, in the video from the 16th, I saw someone appear in the building where I live. Furthermore, through the elevator surveillance video, it shows that he was going to the floor where my house is located. Guess who this person is?\"\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong frowned and retorted, \"Qiao Yong? Qiao Yong used to be a thief. Even without a key, it's possible for him to enter Lao Wang's house. Moreover, his house lock was an old-fashioned anti-theft lock. In the eyes of those thieves, it's no different from leaving the door open.\"\n\nWang Jizhong took out his phone, found a person's photo, and showed it to everyone, asking, \"I've never met Qiao Yong. I don't know if this person is Qiao Yong?\"\n\nDirector Sun, sitting next to him, quickly took the phone to look at it. He was immediately startled and then handed the phone to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nAfter looking at the photo, Lin Xiangbei nodded solemnly and said, \"This person is indeed Qiao Yong.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Wang Jizhong. \"Was Qiao Yong going to kill you? But the car accident caused his plan to fail, and the director chose to kill Qiao Yong to silence him? And then created the subsequent events?\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded and then said, \"So, after the car accident, the rest was 'improvisation.' Without a complete script, they couldn't ensure foolproof execution. Therefore, in this case, they might have left a fatal clue. However, what exactly that clue is, is still unclear.\"\n\nShen Lingdong lowered his head and frowned, lost in thought.\n\nLin Xiangbei clicked his ballpoint pen rhythmically. Originally, everyone was talking, and this sound was not noticeable. But now, it suddenly became quiet, making the sound particularly obvious.\n\nLin Xiangbei quickly looked up at everyone and then slowly said, \"The case will definitely be investigated, but we need to find Zhao Xiaofei as soon as possible. The last place we found the suspect was at the hospital's back door, on the southwest side. We have already searched there, but we did not find the trash can. I think they took Zhao Xiaofei away from the hospital by other means.\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei saw Shen Lingdong's silence and gently nudged him with her arm, asking, \"Why aren't you talking? What are you thinking about?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and then said, \"There was a janitor uncle whom I saw on the evening of the 20th. But I haven't seen him in the following days. I think he's very suspicious.\"\n\n\"Song Changtu, fifty-three years old. He started working on the 5th. He has been working for a short time. We have investigated him. After he met you, he left the hospital, around ten o'clock. The surveillance camera also captured him leaving the hospital.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and then slowly said, \"He said he had been a janitor for a long time. But thinking about it now, it should be his first time as a janitor. Any employee in our company knows that toilet cleaner and disinfectant cannot be used together. If he were a real janitor, he wouldn't not know that. He might be unrelated to Qiao Yong's death, but he might be related to Zhao Xiaofei's kidnapping. He came to the hospital probably to scout the terrain. As long as we find him, we might find Zhao Xiaofei.\"\n\nAfter a slight pause, Shen Lingdong continued, \"Moreover, if Qiao Yong was a part of the script, and the lowest-level 'actor,' then the killer's level might be very high. He might have more information about the director.\"\n\nJust then, Shen Lingdong's phone suddenly rang. Shen Lingdong glanced at his phone and then set it to silent mode.\n\nAt this time, Lin Xiangbei looked at Director Sun.\n\nDirector Sun hesitated for a moment and then said, \"Never mind. Even if there's no evidence, bring the person in first. I'll take responsibility if anything happens.\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking.\n\nLin Xiangbei suddenly stood up and quickly took out his phone to call Tang Feng, asking him to immediately bring Song Changtu to the police station.\n\nThe meeting then adjourned.\n\nShen Lingdong waited in the lounge for a while. Upon learning that Song Changtu's whereabouts had not been found, Shen Lingdong also prepared to leave to investigate himself.\n\nHowever, as soon as Shen Lingdong left, an old man appeared at the entrance of the criminal police team. This old man was the janitor Shen Lingdong had met in the restroom a few days ago. He seemed to be waiting for Shen Lingdong to leave.\n\nThe duty police officer at the door stopped the old man and asked, \"Sir, this is the criminal police team. What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I think I've done wrong for the bad guys. I've come to surrender...\"\n\nThe police officer was startled and quickly asked, \"Sir, what is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Song Changtu.\"",

    "content": "After the on-duty police officer learned the basic situation, they took Song Changtu to the interrogation room.\n\nNot long after, Lin Xiangbei appeared in the interrogation room.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at Song Changtu in front of him and then slowly said, \"Speak, what do you intend to confess?\"\n\nSong Changtu nodded slightly, a trace of fear still in his eyes, and quickly said to Lin Xiangbei, \"I admit it, the police officer at the hospital was taken away by me...\"\n\nLin Xiangbei quickly pressed, \"Where did you take him?\"\n\n\"After I took him out of the ward, I walked towards the southwest side of the hospital's back door. Then I took him to a minivan. The other person's accomplice was waiting for me in the car and asked me to change my clothes.\"\n\n\"What kind of car? What color? Do you remember the license plate number?\"\n\nSong Changtu hesitated for a moment and said, \"A black minivan, the license plate number... a local plate, it had a 3, and then a 5, I think it was two 5s. I can't remember the rest.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately lowered his head and took out his phone to send a WeChat message to Song Hai, asking him to check the hospital's surveillance footage to see if there was a black minivan with a local license plate, possibly containing a 3 and a 5, and if so, to investigate immediately.\n\nThen, Lin Xiangbei looked up at Song Changtu and continued to ask, \"Who was that person?\"\n\n\"I don't know him, but I know he's the young man responsible for cleaning the hospital rooftop.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, then took a photo from a document, showed it to Song Changtu, and asked, \"Is it this person?\"\n\n\"It's him,\" Song Changtu said with certainty.\n\nLin Xiangbei then asked, \"His name is Shen Lingdong. How did you two meet?\"\n\n\"I used to work for Anjie Cleaning Company, and I was one of the cleaners responsible for cleaning Yuhai Villa. Later, he took over the Yuhai Villa business, and I lost my job. Ordinary cleaning jobs didn't want to hire an old man like me. However, he found me more than a month ago and introduced me to a cleaning job at the hospital. I asked him why he did it, and he just told me to find a way to get the key to the rooftop door.\"\n\n\"One time, when city leaders came to the hospital for an inspection, the person in charge asked us to clean the rooftop. I voluntarily took on this job, and the person in charge gave me the key. I made a copy and gave the key to Shen Lingdong. Then he asked me to push a trash can from the southwest side of the hospital's backyard into the corridor on the top floor before I got off work. I didn't know what was inside the trash can, but it felt very heavy. Because it was the time for garbage collection.\"\n\n\"Last night, he found me again and asked me to go to room 1314 to move out the patient inside. It was also because of this incident that I realized that the trash can he asked me to take upstairs a week ago might have also contained a person, possibly the victim who was murdered on the rooftop. I felt like I had become an accomplice, so I turned myself in.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, staring intently at the seemingly sincere Song Changtu, unsure how much of his words were true and how much was false.\n\nAfter a long while, he slowly asked, \"Why did you listen to him? What benefits did he give you?\"\n\nSong Changtu quickly shook his head and said, \"He didn't give me any benefits. When I got the key, I didn't think much of it. After all, he introduced me to this job. But when he asked me to secretly move the patient out, I refused. I didn't expect him to take out the pendant from my son's backpack and say he could pick up my son from school sometime. I was afraid my son would be in danger, so I agreed.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded, then placed the items in his hand on the table and walked out.\n\nLeaving the interrogation room, Lin Xiangbei took out his phone and dialed Shen Lingdong's number. However, to his surprise, Shen Lingdong's phone was turned off.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, pondered for a moment, and then walked towards the technical department.\n\nJust as he reached the entrance of the technical department, Song Hai happened to be walking out.\n\nSong Hai was startled when he saw Lin Xiangbei and quickly said, \"I was just about to look for you. The owner of the black minivan has been identified as Hu Guangming. The license plate number is Dong A3255E. This is his route map. The last image captured by the surveillance camera was in the southern suburbs, near a廃棄 industrial area.\"\n\nWhile speaking, he handed Hu Guangming's information to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at the information, then made a call, asking people to search the southern suburbs and arrest Hu Guangming.\n\n...\n\nAfter Shen Lingdong left the criminal police team, he immediately drove towards the southern suburbs.\n\nDuring the meeting just now, he received a text message which read: \"To save Zhao Xiaofei's life, go to the southern suburbs alone, turn off your phone, turn it on at 3:10 PM, and I will inform you of the specific location.\"\n\nAfter getting into the car, Shen Lingdong turned off his phone and drove quickly. He finally reached the southern suburbs area at 3:10 PM and quickly turned on his phone.\n\nAt this moment, an unknown number called.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly answered the phone, and a voice, altered by a voice changer, came from the other end, \"Drive forward three kilometers, there is a hotel, room 302. The key is under the doormat.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Shen Lingdong started the car again.\n\nFive minutes later, Shen Lingdong indeed saw a hotel by the roadside. The hotel was very simple, without even a sign, just a hotel sign standing at the entrance, which was handwritten, likely for passing drivers to rest.\n\nUpon arriving at the hotel, the receptionist was a middle-aged woman, cracking melon seeds and watching a drama on her tablet, ignoring Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong walked up to the middle-aged woman and asked, \"I want to rent a room.\"\n\n\"30,\" the middle-aged woman said without looking up.\n\n\"Is anyone in 301 or 303?\"\n\n\"Someone is in 301, no one is in 303,\" the middle-aged woman still didn't look at Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"Is 303 next to 302?\"\n\n\"303 is on Mars. Why so many questions?\" The middle-aged woman finally looked up at Shen Lingdong, but at the same time, she gave him a glare.\n\nThe middle-aged woman then handed a key to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong took the key, looked around, found the stairs, and walked upstairs.\n\nThe dim corridor exuded a musty smell, and the sensor lights were not very sensitive, flickering on and off.\n\nArriving at the third floor, room 302 was right in front of him. Shen Lingdong did not stop and walked directly to 303. Fortunately, it was next to 302.\n\nShen Lingdong opened the door and entered room 303.\n\nThe facilities in the room were very simple: a bed, a television, and no private bathroom. The entire room was only about three square meters, but fortunately, there was a window.\n\nShen Lingdong opened the window and looked at the room next door, 302. He found that the distance was not far. Shen Lingdong then stood on the windowsill, holding the window, and looked into room 302.\n\nAfter finding nothing unusual, Shen Lingdong returned to the room, put on gloves, put on shoe covers, and then went to the door of room 302.\n\nFrom under the doormat, he obtained the key and smoothly entered the room.\n\nThis room was no different from room 303 next door. Only a tablet computer was placed on the bed, and next to the tablet was a stack of paper and a pen.\n\nShen Lingdong touched the screen, and it prompted for fingerprint unlocking.\n\nAfter a slight hesitation, Shen Lingdong took off his gloves and used his fingerprint to unlock it.\n\nWith a crisp sound, the tablet unlocked successfully.\n\nAs soon as the tablet was opened, a video began to play.\n\nIn the video, Zhao Xiaofei was lying on the ground.\n\nJust then, the phone suddenly rang. Shen Lingdong quickly answered the call.\n\nThe voice on the other end was still from the voice changer: \"Do you want to save Zhao Xiaofei? You have one hour. Design a perfect crime within an hour, and I will tell you Zhao Xiaofei's location. Otherwise, let Zhao Xiaofei prepare to be sacrificed.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" Shen Lingdong said immediately.\n\n\"You only have one hour. If I don't get what I want after an hour, you will get a corpse.\"\n\nWith that, the other party hung up the phone.\n\nAs soon as he put down the phone, it rang again. It was Lin Xiangbei calling.\n\n\"Hello,\" Shen Lingdong answered the phone softly.\n\n\"Shen Lingdong, where are you now?\"\n\n\"A hotel in the southern suburbs,\" Shen Lingdong replied softly.\n\n\"Southern suburbs? Come back to the police station. You're in trouble.\"\n\n\"I know, but I can't go back yet,\" Shen Lingdong said softly. \"Someone asked me to design a perfect crime within an hour, otherwise they would kill Zhao Xiaofei.\"\n\n\"Don't believe them. We have already gathered some clues about Zhao Xiaofei. We will rescue Zhao Xiaofei. Their goal is to frame you. Don't fall for their trap,\" Lin Xiangbei shouted at Shen Lingdong from the other end of the phone.\n\n\"I'll stall them for time. You search as quickly as possible on your end. If you find Zhao Xiaofei, notify me immediately.\"\n\nWith that, Shen Lingdong hung up the phone.\n\nHalf an hour later, the unknown number called again.\n\nShen Lingdong couldn't help but frown, then answered the call again.\n\nThe other party said, \"Cooperating with the police is a good choice, but do you really trust the police completely? Do you believe your father is guilty? I know the real killer in your father's case. If you choose to join us, I guarantee that the police will find the real killer the next day, and your father will be acquitted.\"\n\nShen Lingdong snorted coldly and said, \"What, you've lost confidence in yourselves? No matter what kind of case you design, it will be solved, so you intend to recruit me? Even if I don't join you, I will catch the real killer myself. What awaits you will be imprisonment.\"\n\n\"Then think about Zhao Xiaofei. When the police find him, he will be a corpse, and in his home, there will be investigation materials on you. You will become one of us, and Zhao Xiaofei's death will be to silence you. You will become the deeply hidden mastermind.\"\n\n\"Okay... I'll design a perfect crime for you.\"\n\nJust then, Shen Lingdong suddenly heard the police voice from the phone, \"Police, don't move.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was startled and then shouted into the phone, \"Hello, is that Captain Lin?\"\n\nA moment later, Lin Xiangbei's voice came from the other end, \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Hello? Captain Lin, it's me, Shen Lingdong.\"\n\n\"Shen Lingdong? Oh, you should come back to the police station. The person you were talking to just now was Hu Guangming.\"\n\n\"Did you find Zhao Xiaofei?\" Shen Lingdong asked quickly.\n\n\"Not yet, but he should be around here. We are investigating. You should come back and see what Hu Guangming has to say...\"\n\n\"En.\" Just as Shen Lingdong was about to push the door to leave, he found himself locked in the room.\n\nShen Lingdong felt that something was wrong, so he tried to climb out of the window to the adjacent room 303. However, he had closed the window when he left, and it couldn't be opened from the outside. Shen Lingdong then moved towards the window of room 301.\n\nAlthough the window of room 301 was also closed, if someone was inside, they could open it from the inside.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong's upper body was at the window of room 301, he saw that room 301 was empty, with nothing inside, and it looked like it had been burned.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and immediately realized that this was not a hotel at all, and the middle-aged woman downstairs was also suspicious.\n\nIt seemed that they had mobilized a lot of personnel to frame him this time.\n\nShen Lingdong returned to room 302, used the bedsheet to make a rope, and climbed down from the window. He untied a section of the rope and returned to the main door.\n\nAt this time, the middle-aged woman was not at the reception desk.\n\nShen Lingdong quietly walked upstairs again.\n\nArriving at the third floor, he found the middle-aged woman sticking to the door of room 302, listening to the movement inside.\n\nShen Lingdong quietly came up behind the middle-aged woman, then used the rope made of bedsheets to tie her up, \"Come to the police station with me.\"\n\nThe middle-aged woman was startled by Shen Lingdong's sudden appearance behind her. Seeing Shen Lingdong about to tie her hands, she struggled and said, \"Young man, what are you doing...\"\n\nAlthough the middle-aged woman had some strength, she was no match for Shen Lingdong. Shen Lingdong directly took her to his car and threw her in the back seat.\n\nThen, Shen Lingdong made a police call.\n\nAbout an hour later, several police cars appeared in front of Shen Lingdong.\n\nTang Feng slowly got out of the police car, walked up to Shen Lingdong, and asked, \"Where is the person?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked back at the back seat.\n\nTang Feng also glanced and then said, \"Is she Hu Guangming's accomplice you mentioned?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nTang Feng then had people pull the middle-aged woman out of the car and put her into the police car. Then he said to Shen Lingdong, \"Shen Lingdong, you can also ride with us. We will also search your car. It's routine, please cooperate.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly, then nodded and said, \"Okay.\"\n\nWith that, he walked towards the police car next to him.",

    "content": "\"Special Scene Cleaner\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei was left speechless by Shen Lingdong's retort, and the chair he sat on felt like it had thorns, causing him to shift his position constantly.\n\nAfter a moment, he stood up and paced back and forth in front of Shen Lingdong.\n\nAlthough there was no evidence, Shen Lingdong's speculation had some merit. After hesitating for a moment, he took out his phone and made a call to their team leader, Lin Xiangbei. At this point, if he didn't notify Captain Lin, he would probably get scolded again.\n\nA moment later, Lin Xiangbei appeared in the reception room and casually sat down next to Shen Lingdong. Then, he looked at Zhao Xiaofei and asked, \"What did you find?\"\n\n\"My classmate analyzed that Wang Mei might be the murderer.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei tilted his head slightly to look at Shen Lingdong and then said softly, \"Wang Mei is indeed one of the suspects we've identified. What are your thoughts? What clues did you find?\"\n\nAt this point, Zhao Xiaofei also said to Shen Lingdong, \"Say what you just said again.\"\n\nShen Lingdong slightly raised his eyelids, looked at Zhao Xiaofei, and said, \"I can't quite remember.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei raised his head and said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Briefly reiterate it.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nWith Zhao Xiaofei's stuttering repetition and Shen Lingdong's additions, Lin Xiangbei finished listening to Shen Lingdong's analysis. After a moment of thought, he asked, \"Why would Wang Mei commit the crime?\"\n\nShen Lingdong replied calmly, \"According to my speculation, when Zheng Ying was renting the apartment, Wang Mei might have taken extremely good care of her. Because Wang Mei's age was not much different from Zheng Ying's mother's age, they called each other mother and daughter.\n\nZheng Ying might have felt that Wang Mei, as a 'mother,' was more understanding than her own biological mother, so she didn't object. However, as time went on, Wang Mei might have wanted to control Zheng Ying's behavior, and Zheng Ying might have resisted.\n\nWang Mei also wanted her 'daughter' to be completely obedient to her. When she realized she couldn't control her, she might have had murderous intent. After committing the crime, she placed the deceased's body neatly on the bed. Perhaps in Wang Mei's mind, she thought her 'daughter' was just asleep, but she had to be well-behaved on the bed, which is why she specifically arranged the posture of the body.\n\nMoreover, the deceased would not have minded wearing only her underwear in front of the killer because they were both women.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei pondered for a moment and then asked softly, \"What did you base this speculation on?\"\n\n\"A new tenant has moved into her house today, who is very likely the next victim. I borrowed an excuse to enter the house to retrieve something and found Ms. Wang enthusiastically helping the tenant tidy up the room. That girl is also trying to escape a blind date arranged by her family and is rebelling against her parents' wishes. I feel that the killer's target demographic is precisely this type.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei quickly stood up and asked Shen Lingdong, \"A new tenant has moved in again. Why are you only telling me this now?\"\n\nShen Lingdong still replied unhurriedly, \"Captain Lin is so anxious, it seems you already believe what I said. However, Captain Lin, rest assured, I have already arranged for the tenant to stay in a safe place.\"\n\n\"Where?\" Lin Xiangbei pressed.\n\n\"At a very reliable friend's house.\"\n\n\"Can I contact him?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then said, \"Why don't we directly interrogate Wang Mei, or search her house? I feel the killer should have kept something belonging to the deceased, but I still haven't figured out the issue with the salt.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei gave Zhao Xiaofei a look. Zhao Xiaofei immediately understood and quickly walked out to assemble the team, preparing to bring Wang Mei back.\n\nShen Lingdong couldn't help with the remaining matters, but he didn't go home either. Instead, he waited in his minivan, wanting to know if this case was related to his father's case.\n\nAs soon as he got into the car, Shen Lingdong finally received a reply message from Zheng Daoguang.\n\nHe told Shen Lingdong that the arrangement of the furniture in the room was nothing special and was purely based on personal preference. During the renovation, no adjustments were made for feng shui reasons.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned. Did Wang Mei not understand feng shui?\n\nIn the blink of an eye, it was already ten o'clock at night. Shen Lingdong, who was munching on bread, kept glancing at the office building of the criminal investigation detachment. The lights were still on, indicating that they were still working overtime and interrogating...\n\nIn the interrogation room, Lin Xiangbei was at a loss for what to do with Wang Mei, who remained tight-lipped. He could only look through the clues in front of him, hoping to find a breakthrough.\n\nSuddenly, Lin Xiangbei looked up at Wang Mei and asked, \"Do you usually like to treat your tenants like daughters?\"\n\n\"I really like being with young people. Besides, the girls renting my apartment are all young, and I have a lot of fun with them. How could I have killed them?\" Wang Mei scoffed at Lin Xiangbei's suggestion that she had killed Zheng Ying and let out a cold laugh.\n\n\"I see from the file that you and your husband, Li Qingchun, once had a daughter.\"\n\nWang Mei's eyes flickered, and then she slowly said, \"That's right, but she died in an accident when she was twelve years old.\"\n\n\"How did the accident happen?\"\n\nAfter staring at Lin Xiangbei for a few seconds, Wang Mei said, \"I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to recall it.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at the file and then said, \"According to your husband, it happened because you scolded your daughter, and she ran away from home, resulting in an accident?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Wang Mei said, gritting her teeth and clenching her fists.\n\n\"Zheng Ying also ran away from home and rented your apartment, didn't she?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I don't ask about her affairs.\"\n\n\"But your latest tenant, Di Fang, you knew she was renting an apartment to avoid a blind date arranged by her family, and you were even going to help her find a boyfriend?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell them that a murder had occurred in your house? And why did you rent the house to someone else when your husband had already agreed to rent it to Shen Lingdong?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"Rental matters are basically handled by me, and my husband has no decision-making power. I didn't tell them about the incident because I hadn't had time to update the rental information.\" Wang Mei replied.\n\nLin Xiangbei lightly acknowledged, then continued to ask, \"Your husband only discovered Zheng Ying's body when he went to collect the rent. Since you are responsible for the rental matters, and the deceased paid rent once a month through WeChat transfer, with the payment date always fixed on the twelfth, why did you let your husband go to collect rent a month after the deceased's death?\"\n\n\"Because I somewhat forgot about the rent. By the time I remembered, it was already August.\"\n\n\"Forgot about the rent? It's likely because Zheng Ying had no intention of continuing to rent. She was a full-time author, and the main conflict with her family was because she planned to find a quiet place to finish the final part of her novel. Her novel was completed in early July, and she mentioned her situation in her reader group, saying that after finishing the novel, she would use the manuscript fees to take her parents on a trip.\"",

    "content": "Special Scene Cleanup Specialist\n\nLin Xiangbei quickly brought his people to the hospital. After understanding the relevant situation, he organized his team members to search and, at the same time, began investigating the hospital's surveillance footage, with Tang Feng in charge of the investigation.\n\nAt 11:03 AM, a man in protective clothing appeared in front of Zhao Xiaofei's hospital room. He seemed to be collecting trash. After staying for nearly five minutes, he pushed a trash can and left, then took the elevator.\n\nAfter leaving the hospital building, he pushed the trash can to the hospital's back door. Finally, he pushed the trash can into a blind spot of the surveillance cameras, and his image was no longer seen by the cameras.\n\nAt this time, Lin Xiangbei was debriefing with Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong reported the situation to Lin Xiangbei truthfully. He arrived at the hospital at 8:30 AM and stayed in Zhao Xiaofei's room for less than ten minutes before heading to the rooftop to clean. Since there wasn't much to clean on the rooftop, Shen Lingdong planned to help Zhao Xiaofei with his discharge procedures after the cleanup.\n\nDuring the cleanup, because there was a lot of shattered ice, they used trash cans to transport the shattered ice downstairs. Just as they were about to finish, they received a call from the hospital saying that Zhao Xiaofei was missing.\n\nShen Lingdong also reported it to the police immediately.\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Tang Feng arrived in front of Lin Xiangbei. He glanced at Shen Lingdong, who was wearing protective clothing, and did not speak.\n\n\"Long time no see,\" Shen Lingdong greeted softly.\n\n\"Captain Lin, in the surveillance video, a suspicious man appeared in front of Zhao Xiaofei's room, pushing a trash can. It's very likely that the suspicious man used the trash can to take Zhao Xiaofei away from his room,\" Tang Feng said, reporting to Lin Xiangbei, but his gaze remained fixed on Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong remained silent. Seeing Tang Feng's demeanor, he knew that he had already identified him as the suspect.\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and then said, \"Okay, I understand. Go and question the nearby merchants to see if they've noticed any suspicious vehicles...\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain Lin.\"\n\nAs Tang Feng left, Shen Lingdong asked Lin Xiangbei, \"He suspects me?\"\n\n\"It's okay, it's not a big problem. Give me your chest-mounted recorder, and don't tell me you forgot to turn it on,\" Lin Xiangbei said, pointing to Shen Lingdong's chest.\n\n\"It's on, it's on...\" Shen Lingdong quickly took off the recorder and handed it to Lin Xiangbei.\n\n\"I'll take it back to the criminal police team first. You can pick it up later,\" Lin Xiangbei told Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"I want to participate in the investigation,\" Shen Lingdong pleaded with Lin Xiangbei. Although he was not a police officer, he could not stand idly by, especially since Zhao Xiaofei was the one who was in trouble.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, hesitated for a moment, and then nodded, saying, \"Alright, you'll come with me to the criminal police team later.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nLin Xiangbei then went to attend to other matters. Shen Lingdong asked Lao Zheng and Xu Tao to return to the company first and take the cleaning tools with them. He stayed behind to wait for Lin Xiangbei and the others to finish their investigation.\n\nIn the car, Shen Lingdong took out his phone and sent another WeChat message to Wang Jizhong: \"Zhao Xiaofei is missing again.\"\n\nShen Lingdong had already sent many messages to Wang Jizhong, but Lao Wang had not replied.\n\nJust as Shen Lingdong was about to put his phone away, it suddenly rang, saying, \"I'll be at the criminal police team later.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly replied with a \"Good.\"\n\nAt this time, Lin Xiangbei and their investigation had concluded. They had already begun to follow the clues they had to investigate that mystery. Lin Xiangbei and Shen Lingdong drove back to the criminal police team, one after the other.\n\nUpon returning to the criminal police team, Shen Lingdong and Lin Xiangbei went to the conference room. A short while later, Wang Jizhong also arrived at the criminal police team. Besides the three of them, Director Sun and Gu Caiwei were also in the conference room.\n\nThe five of them sat in the conference room. Director Sun looked at everyone and then slowly said, \"Zhao Xiaofei is one of our people. Now that he has been taken away from the hospital, this matter is a disgrace to us police officers. No matter what methods you use, you must find Zhao Xiaofei.\"\n\n\"We have already gathered some clues and are currently investigating,\" Lin Xiangbei quickly replied to Director Sun.\n\n\"As soon as possible, time waits for no one. The more we waste every second, the greater the risk to Zhao Xiaofei's life,\" Director Sun said sternly, tapping the table with a grave expression.\n\nEveryone lowered their heads.\n\nWang Jizhong looked at everyone with a poker face and then slowly said, \"Let's first figure out what their purpose is in taking Zhao Xiaofei. Is it to frame him, extort him, or seek revenge? We can temporarily set aside the case of Qiao Yong's death, but consider the entire process from Zhao Xiaofei's car accident to his kidnapping in the hospital. I don't know many of the case details. Who can tell me?\"\n\nAt this time, Gu Caiwei slowly said, \"After Zhao Xiaofei's accident, I, Shen Lingdong, and Liao Jia had the most contact with Zhao Xiaofei. Let me tell you. At 18:07 on the 20th, Zhao Xiaofei left the criminal police team after work. He originally planned to invite Liao Jia to dinner, but Liao Jia ignored Zhao Xiaofei because of what happened last time. Everyone was present, so I won't repeat it.\"\n\n\"When the car accident happened, Liao Jia was wearing headphones and waiting at a traffic light. She didn't notice her surroundings. Then, a black car ran a red light. To avoid a car from the side, the black car slid sideways and crashed towards Liao Jia. We checked the surveillance video. Based on Zhao Xiaofei's position at the time, the car would not have hit him. He went to save Liao Jia, which resulted in him being hit by the car.\"\n\nAfter that, a murder occurred in the hospital. The hospital director demanded that the rooftop be unsealed and cleaned as soon as possible. After our meeting and discussion, we decided to unseal it this morning and have Shen Lingdong carry out the cleaning. Just as Shen Lingdong was about to finish cleaning, Zhao Xiaofei went missing. According to the surveillance video investigation, a man in protective clothing entered Zhao Xiaofei's room pushing a trash can. Therefore, we deduced that Zhao Xiaofei might have been taken away through the trash can.\"\n\nWang Jizhong hesitated for a moment and then slowly said, \"In other words, the killer took advantage of Shen Lingdong's cleaning time and special attire to infiltrate the hospital and take Zhao Xiaofei away without arousing suspicion. Otherwise, at other times, wearing protective clothing would still attract a lot of attention. But today, no matter who saw him, they would assume the suspect was one of Shen Lingdong's people.\"\n\n\"Moreover, there is another point of doubt. If Qiao Yong's car accident was also part of the plan, then the injured person should have been Liao Jia, not Zhao Xiaofei. We must also consider this.\"\n\nAt this time, Gu Caiwei quickly said, \"Because in the threatening WeChat message Shen Lingdong received last time, the next target of the suspect was clearly pointed out as being everyone present except Director Sun. They also stated that they would frame Shen Lingdong. Currently, although there are many doubts surrounding Shen Lingdong, there is evidence to prove his innocence. Therefore, I think they took Zhao Xiaofei likely for their next move.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei's expression was grave, and Shen Lingdong's face was also grim.\n\nBy kidnapping Zhao Xiaofei, they would have ample time to set up the scene and frame Shen Lingdong, so Zhao Xiaofei was in grave danger.\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong slowly said, \"I don't think Zhao Xiaofei will be in any danger.\"\n\nAt this moment, everyone's gaze turned to Wang Jizhong. Wang Jizhong continued, \"For the past few days, I've been at home. I found a fingerprint on a water glass at my house. I took the fingerprint and printed it out.\n\nCoincidentally, the next day, Shen Lingdong came to my house, and I handed him a glass of water. After he left, I extracted his fingerprints from his glass. After comparison, the two fingerprints matched. Before this, Shen Lingdong had never been to my house. How did his fingerprint appear in my house?\n\nI immediately conducted a search of my own home. It was very clean, with no traces except for that one fingerprint. It was as if my house had been cleaned once, but from the outside, there was no abnormality. I suspect that the director's real target was me, but Zhao Xiaofei's sudden car accident made them change their minds at the last minute.\"\n\n\"For the past few days, I have reviewed all the surveillance videos in my neighborhood. Finally, in the video from the 16th, I found someone appearing in the building where I live. Moreover, the elevator surveillance video shows that he was going to the floor where my house is. Guess who this person is?\"\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong frowned and retorted, \"Qiao Yong? Qiao Yong was a thief before. Even without a key, it was possible for him to enter Lao Wang's house. Besides, the lock on his door was an old-fashioned anti-theft lock. In the eyes of those thieves, it was no different from an unlocked door.\"\n\nWang Jizhong took out his phone, found a photo of a person, and then showed it to everyone, asking, \"I haven't met Qiao Yong, so I don't know if this person is Qiao Yong?\"\n\nDirector Sun, sitting next to him, quickly took the phone to look at it. He was immediately surprised and then handed the phone to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nAfter Lin Xiangbei looked at the photo, he nodded with a grave expression and said, \"This person is indeed Qiao Yong.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Wang Jizhong, \"Was Qiao Yong trying to kill you? But due to the car accident, his plan failed, and the director chose to kill Qiao Yong to silence him? And then created the subsequent events?\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded and then said, \"So, after the car accident, the rest was 'improvisation.' Without a sufficient script, they couldn't guarantee perfection. Therefore, in this case, they might have left a fatal clue. However, what that clue is, is not yet clear.\"\n\nShen Lingdong lowered his head, frowning, and fell into thought.\n\nLin Xiangbei clicked his ballpoint pen with a \"click, click\" sound. When everyone was talking, this sound was not obvious, but at this moment, it suddenly became quiet, so this sound was exceptionally noticeable.\n\nLin Xiangbei quickly looked up at everyone and then slowly said, \"The case will definitely be investigated, but we need to find Zhao Xiaofei as soon as possible. The last place we found the suspect was at the rear entrance of the hospital, on the southwest side. We have already searched there, but we haven't found that trash can. I think they took Zhao Xiaofei away from the hospital through other means.\"\n\nAt this time, Gu Caiwei saw Shen Lingdong's silence and then gently nudged him with her arm, asking, \"Why aren't you speaking? What are you thinking about?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and then said, \"There was a janitor uncle whom I saw on the evening of the 20th, but I haven't seen him in the following days. I think he's very suspicious.\"\n\n\"Song Changtu, fifty-three years old. He joined on the 5th. He has been working for a short time. We have already investigated him. After he saw you, he left the hospital around ten o'clock, and the surveillance camera also captured him leaving the hospital.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and then slowly said, \"He said he had been working as a janitor for a long time, but now that I think about it, he should have been a janitor for the first time. Any employee in our company knows that toilet cleaner and disinfectant cannot be used at the same time. If he were a real janitor, he wouldn't know this. He might not be related to Qiao Yong's death, but he might be related to Zhao Xiaofei's kidnapping. He probably came to the hospital to reconnoiter the terrain. As long as we find him, we might find Zhao Xiaofei.\"\n\nAfter a slight pause, Shen Lingdong continued, \"Moreover, if Qiao Yong was part of the script, and the most junior 'actor,' then the killer's rank might be very high, and they might have more information about the director.\"\n\nJust then, Shen Lingdong's phone suddenly rang. Shen Lingdong glanced at his phone and then switched it to silent mode.\n\nAt this time, Lin Xiangbei looked at Director Sun.\n\nDirector Sun hesitated for a moment and then said, \"No matter what, even if there's no evidence, bring the person in first. I'll take responsibility if anything happens.\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking.\n\nLin Xiangbei suddenly stood up and quickly took out his phone to call Tang Feng, asking him to immediately bring Song Changtu to the police station.\n\nEveryone then dispersed.\n\nShen Lingdong waited in the lounge for a while. Upon learning that Song Changtu's whereabouts had not been found, Shen Lingdong also prepared to leave to investigate himself.\n\nHowever, as soon as Shen Lingdong left, an old man appeared at the entrance of the criminal police team. This old man was the janitor uncle that Shen Lingdong had met in the restroom a few days ago. It was as if he was waiting for Shen Lingdong to leave.\n\nThe duty police officer at the entrance stopped the old man and asked, \"Uncle, this is the criminal police team. May I ask what you need?\"\n\n\"I feel like I've done wrong for the bad guys. I've come to surrender...\"\n\nThe police officer was startled and quickly asked, \"Uncle, what is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Song Changtu.\"",

She knew it would be difficult to change Shen Lingdong's mind, but as a friend, she still wanted to try and persuade him.\n\nAfter a pause, Gu Caiwei continued, \"Don't you even think about why they would do this? If they are targeting you, their goal is to send you to prison. Even if everyone knows you are innocent, without evidence, you can only face imprisonment. I know you want to overturn the case for your father, but based on my investigation during this period, I haven't found any doubts. Even though I believe you, and believe Uncle is innocent, you can't get yourself entangled in this matter. I feel that Uncle Shen not telling you the details of the case is probably also because you are in trouble.\"\n\nShen Lingdong turned his head slightly to look at Gu Caiwei and said softly, \"Thank you for your help...\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei pushed open the door and walked in, holding a report. Without looking up, he said to Shen Lingdong, \"Shen Lingdong, that...\"\n\nLin Xiangbei suddenly saw Gu Caiwei sitting next to Shen Lingdong and quickly said, \"Caiwei is here too. Perfect, help me out. I'm short on staff. Go investigate their boss at the \"Clever Detective Case Office\". Also, bring back the script.\"\n\n\"Okay, Captain Lin,\" Gu Caiwei replied. She quickly stood up, took the file from Lin Xiangbei's hand, and then walked outside.\n\nBefore leaving, she specifically looked back at Shen Lingdong, her eyes wide, warning him not to confess to the crime.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately asked, \"What's wrong with their boss?\"\n\nHe remembered that this script murder mystery store was Yuan Yuan's former company, and he had investigated it before.\n\n\"According to Hu Guangming's confession, his connection with the mastermind was through that script murder mystery store.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and said, \"The mastermind mentioned by Hu Guangming... is me, right?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded lightly.\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"I suspected it before, but Old Wang checked and found nothing unusual. It was because their company also rented Yu Hai Villa before...\"\n\n\"If the company can't find anything, then the problem lies with the script. Hu Guangming said the information was transmitted through the script.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"I have an idea. What if I confess that I am the mastermind?\"\n\n\"Why would you do that?\" Lin Xiangbei immediately asked.\n\n\"To disrupt their plan. With just the confessions of those three people, it would be difficult to directly convict me. They might have fabricated some physical evidence. After all, they have collected my fingerprints. If I don't confess, they will create more physical evidence. But if I confess, they might stop creating new evidence, which would be more advantageous for me. And while I am on trial, you can look for new evidence, such as finding Zhao Xiaofei or the families of those three people.\"\n\n\"Those three people are currently accomplices. Even if they were coerced, it would be difficult to leave the police station in a short time. Their families can't hide forever and will eventually show up. Finding their families can also solve the problem.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei pondered for a moment, then shook his head and said, \"It's too risky. Moreover, even if you confess, there's an important condition: where you put Zhao Xiaofei. Zhao Xiaofei is likely in grave danger now.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lin Xiangbei poured a cup of hot water from the nearby hot water dispenser and handed it to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong was about to say that he suspected Zhao Xiaofei might have been taken to the crematorium to be cremated directly, but seeing the cup of hot water in Lin Xiangbei's hand, Shen Lingdong stopped.\n\nLin Xiangbei, seeing Shen Lingdong stunned, quickly said, \"Go on.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"When Hu Guangming showed me the video of Zhao Xiaofei, I noticed some fog. But now it seems it might not be fog, but water mist. Warm air entering a cold room will cause water mist, so... Zhao Xiaofei's location at that time should have been a cold place, and there was a very hot room next to him.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei looked outside and said, \"The temperature outside is very low now, basically below zero in places without heating.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stared at the cup of hot water and slowly said, \"It should be a place with little activity. If people frequently entered and exited that room, the water mist in the room would condense into water droplets, adhere to the walls, and then freeze. But that place...\"\n\nAfter a pause, Shen Lingdong looked up at Lin Xiangbei and said, \"Could it be the hotel where I appeared?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei was startled and then said, \"That hotel was temporarily renovated. Five months ago, it experienced a fire. It was basically only the exterior that was burned, and the interior was mostly intact. However, because a guest on the second floor died in the fire, it was abandoned and no one lived there. But the internal facilities are basically still intact. If it were to be converted into a hotel, the heating problem would need to be solved. That building, even if only rooms 303 and 302 have normal temperatures, there is a need for heating. The boiler in the basement used for heating can also be used normally, so...\"\n\nShen Lingdong suddenly stood up and quickly said, \"Zhao Xiaofei should be in the room next to the boiler room.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei quickly dialed a team member and told him to go to the hotel's basement immediately to check. After hanging up, he was still a bit worried and asked Shen Lingdong to go with him.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and followed Lin Xiangbei out.\n\n...\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong and Lin Xiangbei arrived at the South Suburb Hotel, they saw an ambulance parked at the entrance from a distance, with several police cars next to it.\n\nLin Xiangbei couldn't help but speed up. He arrived at the hotel entrance, parked the car on the side of the road, and the two of them quickly got out.\n\nAs soon as they reached the entrance, they saw several medical personnel carrying a stretcher out. Lying on the stretcher was Zhao Xiaofei.\n\n\"How is he?\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly asked the medical personnel.\n\n\"The patient is unconscious and suffering from severe hypothermia. His condition is quite critical.\"\n\nShen Lingdong and Lin Xiangbei involuntarily took off their clothes and covered Zhao Xiaofei with them. They watched as he was pushed into the ambulance.\n\nAfter the ambulance left, Lin Xiangbei quickly walked towards his car, and Shen Lingdong followed him.\n\nAfter getting into the car, although Lin Xiangbei was still worried about Zhao Xiaofei's safety, he felt a bit more relieved. As long as Zhao Xiaofei woke up, some issues would naturally become clear.",

After treatment, he was out of danger and had regained consciousness.\n\nHowever, the doctor instructed the patient to rest and forcefully kicked Lin Xiangbei and the others out. Under duress, Lin Xiangbei had to call Liao Jia and ask him to take care of Zhao Xiaofei. If he could find out some information, that would be even better. If Zhao Xiaofei was feeling unwell, he should just rest.\n\nThere was no rush to get answers from him; the most important thing was that he was safe.\n\nWhile waiting for Liao Jia to arrive, a nurse came out of the ward and asked the people waiting outside, \"Who is Shen Lingdong?\"\n\n\"I am,\" Shen Lingdong quickly raised his head to look at the nurse.\n\n\"You can go in. The patient wants to talk to you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at Lin Xiangbei, then walked into the ward.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Xiaofei still had an IV drip in the back of his hand, and the casts on his other arm and leg had been replaced. Although he looked rather pathetic, his mental state was quite good.\n\nShen Lingdong sat down on a chair and smiled slightly at Zhao Xiaofei, saying, \"What is it that you have to say right now?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei gave a wry smile and said, \"Seeing me like this, are you feeling particularly smug?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and nodded.\n\nZhao Xiaofei also laughed, \"It's the same feeling I had when I saw you as a cleaner. I couldn't wait to tell the whole world that the brilliant detective from our class had become a cleaner. I felt really good watching you cleaning at the crime scene back then.\"\n\n\"So you really wanted to see it a few more times? However, you also helped me. The company had no business at the time, and it was precisely because of the orders you introduced that the cleanup team exists now. Honestly, I should really thank you.\"\n\n\"Am I not suited to be a police officer, someone like me?\"\n\n\"You serve the people. As long as you have a clear conscience towards the people, you are a police officer, and a good one at that,\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\n\"Are we considered friends?\" Zhao Xiaofei asked.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nA hint of satisfaction appeared in Zhao Xiaofei's eyes, and he slowly began to speak, \"All along, I've treated you as my imaginary enemy. I thought it was just bad luck on my part. Now I've truly recognized myself. Even with your and Captain Lin's help, I probably won't be able to become a qualified criminal investigator. So, I've decided that once my injuries heal, I'll apply for resignation.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei smiled and said, \"I need to earn money to support my family. I can't compare to you in solving cases, but I don't believe I can't compare to you in making money either.\"\n\nShen Lingdong also echoed with a smile, \"Then you'll have to work hard. My company, after deducting all costs, can earn ten to twenty thousand yuan a month.\"\n\n\"Not bad...\"\n\n\"Um... I'd like to ask you for a favor. When Captain Lin asks you later, just say...\"\n\nShen Lingdong was halfway through his sentence when the nurse pushed the door open and said to Shen Lingdong, \"It's about time. The patient needs to rest.\"\n\n\"Just one sentence.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe nurse glared at Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong reluctantly stood up and said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Rest well.\"\n\nWith that, he left the room.\n\nUpon exiting the ward, Lin Xiangbei immediately approached Shen Lingdong and asked, \"What did Zhao Xiaofei say?\"\n\n\"He said he wants to resign,\" Shen Lingdong replied.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned and asked, \"He didn't say anything about you?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head.\n\nLin Xiangbei then realized, and looked at Shen Lingdong with surprise, \"He's quitting? He told you himself? I don't agree!\"\n\nJust then, Liao Jia arrived at the ward. He came up to Lin Xiangbei, panting, and said, \"Captain Lin, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Why are you so out of breath?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"The elevator was too crowded, so I took the stairs.\"\n\n\"Oh, Zhao Xiaofei is inside. He's okay. Go take care of him. Also, I'll arrange for two more people to be outside. If he's in good condition, you can ask him about the case.\"\n\nLiao Jia nodded and then entered the ward.\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at Shen Lingdong, then said, \"Let's head back to the police station to wait for news and see the suspects' reactions.\"\n\n...\n\nThe group returned to the police station.\n\nAt this time, Tang Feng had also returned from collecting evidence at Zhao Xiaofei's home and rushed to report to Lin Xiangbei with a report.\n\nUpon learning that Lin Xiangbei was in the lounge, he hurried over.\n\nPushing open the lounge door, Tang Feng said to the people inside, \"Captain Lin, I found something at Zhao Xiaofei's place regarding...\"\n\nAt this moment, Tang Feng saw Shen Lingdong sitting next to Lin Xiangbei.\n\n\"We found evidence that Shen Lingdong is the mastermind. Tell us about it.\" Lin Xiangbei did not intend to take the report Tang Feng handed over.\n\nTang Feng looked troubled and glanced at Shen Lingdong, then said, \"This... it's not convenient.\"\n\n\"It's okay, speak up. I'll give you a chance to confront him directly.\"\n\nTang Feng swallowed and then said, \"Zhao Xiaofei found an email from Shen Lingdong detailing the crime implementation plan. The IP address came from Shen Lingdong's company.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at Shen Lingdong and then said, \"IP addresses can be faked.\"\n\n\"But the content cannot be faked. I've read Shen Lingdong's crime scene cleanup report, and the content is extremely similar to that crime plan. Moreover, Zhao Xiaofei also found a bank card receipt from Shen Lingdong. The name of the remitter also appears on Song Changtu's bank card receipt.\"\n\n\"Let me see.\"\n\nTang Feng then handed the bank statement to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nOn the statements of Shen Lingdong and Song Changtu, there was a common name: Zhou Xinghuai.\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately said, \"This person is... the owner of the 'Ancient Spirit Detective Agency'...\"\n\nAs he spoke, he handed the statement to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong took the statement, glanced at the amount behind it, one hundred thousand yuan.\n\nThis was the first year's advance payment from Wu Anguo for cleaning the Jade Sea Villa, which he had signed a contract for. However, Wu Anguo had said at the time that he was abroad and it was inconvenient to transfer the money, so he would arrange for someone to do it. But Shen Lingdong never expected that this person would also be connected to the \"director.\"\n\nAfterward, Shen Lingdong explained, \"This is the money from the contract I signed with Jade Sea Villa.\"\n\nTang Feng looked at Shen Lingdong at this moment, \"In terms of company qualifications and capabilities, there are many stronger companies than yours in Dongjiang City. Why would he give such a large order to a small company like yours?\"\n\nShen Lingdong snorted coldly, \"Since Zhao Xiaofei has found evidence of my crime, why hasn't he handed it over to the police? And now that he's been found, why isn't he testifying against me?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at Tang Feng with a look of doubt, waiting for how he would refute Shen Lingdong.\n\nTang Feng smiled slightly and then took out a blueprint.\n\nThis drawing recreated the incident of Zhao Xiaofei being hit by a car, or rather, the plan. It clearly indicated the angle at which the car skidded, the speed of the car at the time, the angle and distance Zhao Xiaofei would be thrown, and even the range of the car's impact was clearly marked.\n\nA confident glint appeared in Tang Feng's eyes as he said, \"I checked the surveillance footage from that time. Even if Liao Jia hadn't dodged, the car wouldn't have hit him. And the snowdrift behind Zhao Xiaofei was also deliberate.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Tang Feng took out a screenshot from the surveillance video and said, \"This is a screenshot from the surveillance video on the day of the accident. The sanitation workers were clearing the snow from the sidewalk, and the person clearing that snowdrift behind Zhao Xiaofei at the time was Hu Guangming. He deliberately placed that snowdrift there to reduce Zhao Xiaofei's injuries.\"\n\n\"Why would he do that?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Because Zhao Xiaofei has been bought, and the price is Liao Jia! Shen Lingdong helped Zhao Xiaofei pursue Liao Jia and designed this car accident. Now that Zhao Xiaofei and Liao Jia are together as they wished, Zhao Xiaofei naturally won't report Shen Lingdong. I just heard that Zhao Xiaofei plans to resign. Captain Lin, you should consider why Zhao Xiaofei is resigning at this time?\"",

    "title": "Chapter 115 Confession",
    "content": "**Chapter 115: The Confession**\n\n\"Tang Feng, you need evidence for what you're saying.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei reminded Tang Feng. Saying these things in front of Shen Lingdong could cause unnecessary trouble if he decided to pursue the matter. Although he knew Shen Lingdong wouldn't, and he wanted to believe Shen Lingdong, he was also curious to see the confrontation between Tang Feng and Shen Lingdong, and even more curious how Shen Lingdong would explain these things. Especially what Zhao Xiaofei and Shen Lingdong discussed privately in the room.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Tang Feng. He didn't plan to explain. He had intended to admit he was the mastermind, but if he confessed now, it would undoubtedly drag Zhao Xiaofei down with him. The blame would have to be borne by him alone.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Shen Lingdong slowly said, \"According to you, that car accident was deliberately designed. Sun Yong's actions could be controlled; he could run a red light. However, I couldn't control the vehicle driving normally from the side. Don't forget, Sun Yong's car overturned to avoid that vehicle. After the accident, the driver, Sun Yong, fled to a nearby shopping mall. According to surveillance footage, he disappeared in a second-floor restroom. Although I was also near the mall at the time, if I used some trick to bring Sun Yong to my car, I would take him to the hospital and detain him in the car for four to five hours. My alibi only covers the time in the middle of the night.\n\nHowever, the surveillance video did not capture me leaving the hospital, returning to the car, taking Sun Yong to the hospital rooftop, and killing him. Then calling the police and subsequently cleaning up the crime scene. And when Zhao Xiaofei was about to be discharged, I kidnapped him and put him in danger... Is that right?\"\n\nTang Feng nodded.\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"But according to your statement, Zhao Xiaofei had already been bribed by me before the car accident. Why would I still kidnap Zhao Xiaofei? What was the purpose?\"\n\nTang Feng frowned.\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"According to your statement, I should have arranged for Song Changtu to get into the hospital, find a way to get the key to the rooftop, and then have Hu Guangming prepare the safety measures for the accident scene. Furthermore, according to their confessions, they were all threatened. With Zhao Xiaofei already bribed, I still chose to kidnap Zhao Xiaofei and even added another accomplice, Wang Lan, also threatening her family. This undoubtedly increased the risk of exposure. I couldn't have done all this alone.\n\nRegarding Zhao Xiaofei pursuing Liao Jia, even without this car accident, they would have ended up together eventually. They didn't need outside help. It's just that Zhao Xiaofei's sudden confession last time made the situation a bit inexplicable. As for why Zhao Xiaofei resigned, he's in the hospital now. You can ask him yourself. Even as a classmate, you should visit him.\"\n\nTang Feng's brow was furrowed. He then looked at the documents in his hand and suddenly discovered an important clue. He quickly said, \"Even if Zhao Xiaofei wasn't bribed, he might have been hypnotized and brainwashed. On your activity log, I found that you visited a psychological clinic every week. I investigated that psychologist, Lin Suqing. She has high hypnotic skills, and during the time Zhao Xiaofei was missing, she was also conveniently absent from the clinic, her whereabouts unknown.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, then said, \"Her matter has nothing to do with me. You can go directly to her. Besides, I saw her for my own psychological treatment, and it was Gu Caiwei who introduced me to her. You don't suspect Gu Caiwei as well, do you?\"\n\nTang Feng lowered his head, pondered for a moment, and then suddenly smiled. \"As expected of Shen Lingdong. But as long as it's human activity, there will always be evidence left behind. I will find evidence of your crimes sooner or later!\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Staring at me will make you miss a lot.\"\n\n\"No, I'll not only stare at you, but I'll stare you down.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei slowly spoke up, \"Alright, Tang Feng, if there's no new evidence, don't say anymore. Zhao Xiaofei's matter has been resolved. Our main focus now is to get Song Changtu, Hu Guangming, and Wang Lan to tell the truth and solve the murder case of Sun Yong. As for your matters with Shen Lingdong, we'll proceed as previously agreed.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei's words clearly showed his displeasure towards Tang Feng.\n\nJust then, Gu Caiwei arrived at the lounge and said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Captain Lin, the owner of the script-killing store, Zhou Xinghuai, has been brought back.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately stood up and asked Gu Caiwei, \"What was his reaction?\"\n\n\"He seemed a bit surprised, saying we might have made a mistake. But when I investigated the scripts on my list, his expression changed. We found some suspected instructions related to this case in those scripts.\"\n\n\"I'll go take a look.\"\n\nWith that, Lin Xiangbei left with Gu Caiwei.\n\nIn the room, only Tang Feng and Shen Lingdong remained.\n\nTang Feng stared intently at Shen Lingdong and suddenly asked, \"What is your purpose?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly without speaking.\n\nTang Feng frowned, his gaze fixed on Shen Lingdong. Seeing that Shen Lingdong remained silent, he continued, \"I suspect you planned the previous cases as well, using salt at the scene to create a mystique, making the police consolidate the cases. But when you found it ineffective, you then proceeded to solve the cases to gain the police's trust.\"\n\n\"In the Jade Sea Villa case, the death of the real culprit, Zhao Bo, was also very suspicious and seemed deliberately orchestrated by you. What did you say to Zhao Bo before you started recording the video? With your skills, I feel like you were deliberately taken hostage to orchestrate Zhao Bo's death.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately said, \"There was no salt in the Jade Sea Villa and Sun Yong cases.\"\n\nTang Feng quickly retorted, \"The Jade Sea Villa case is different from the other cases. However, the Sun Yong case has a connection to the previous cases. The previous one used salt to lock souls, while the Sun Yong case involved borrowing life. These are all superstitious claims, which is their commonality. Therefore, I suspect that the Sun Yong case, like the previous cases, was all orchestrated by you. You did this to save your father.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly startled, then said, \"Where is the evidence?\"\n\nA glimmer of light suddenly appeared in Tang Feng's eyes. He quickly said, \"Did I get it right?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked around, lowered his head, leaned towards Tang Feng, and whispered, \"You won't find any evidence. Even if I told you everything, you still wouldn't find any evidence.\"\n\nTang Feng straightened up, looked at Shen Lingdong, his pupils contracting slightly, and whispered, \"Tell me.\"",

    "content": "，Special Scene Cleaner\n\nEmerging from the interrogation room, Lin Xiangbei went to the adjacent interrogation room of Guo Jian, the person who had impersonated Song Ming's WeChat to chat with the deceased.\n\nAs soon as he entered the room, Zhao Xiaofei quickly called out, \"Captain Lin.\"\n\n\"How is it?\"\n\n\"He confessed everything.\" Zhao Xiaofei handed the written statement to Lin Xiangbei. There wasn't much recorded, only one sentence: \"I killed everyone.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei looked up at Guo Jian and asked doubtfully, \"You killed everyone?\"\n\nGuo Jian nodded.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, pulled over a chair, sat down, and asked, \"Then tell me, how did Jing Liang die?\"\n\nSeeing that Guo Jian didn't speak, Lin Xiangbei continued, \"Can't you say?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at the confession again, then slowly said, \"You were very cooperative when you were arrested, and when giving your statement, you just left one sentence saying you killed everyone, and then refused to cooperate. That's quite a contrast. Moreover, the others have already told the truth. If you continue like this, you won't be the mastermind, but you might still be severely punished.\"\n\n\"Death penalty?\" Guo Jian looked up at Lin Xiangbei, a slight upward curve on the corner of his mouth, a small angle, difficult to detect.\n\nBut Lin Xiangbei noticed it.\n\nWhy did he seem to have a hint of schadenfreude?\n\nLin Xiangbei then said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"Get me his information.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei handed a form to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nLin Xiangbei took a look, and at the end, he saw that his wife and daughter had died in a car accident in 2017.\n\nLin Xiangbei pondered for a moment, then looked up at Guo Jian and said, \"If you really didn't want to live, you wouldn't have waited until now. This idea might have been in your mind for a long time, but you don't have the courage to face death. In other words, you haven't lived enough.\"\n\nAt this moment, Guo Jian's eyes turned red, his fists clenched, and he slammed the chair, saying, \"I want to die.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei tilted his chin up slightly and said, \"Tell me why you want to die?\"\n\nGuo Jian hesitated slightly, then slowly opened his mouth and said, \"My wife and children are all dead. I want to go down and reunite with them as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Is it related to Song Ming?\"\n\nGuo Jian nodded slightly, then said, \"One day, I was driving my wife and children on a road trip. When we were returning to Dongjiang City, it was already midnight. Just as we were about to enter Dongjiang City, a car hit mine from the side. My car overturned and flew down the slope.\n\nAs I was in a daze, I saw a figure standing by the roadside looking.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was already lying in the hospital, and my wife and children had left me forever. At that time, they were sleeping in the car, but they never woke up.\n\nThe next day, the traffic police told me that the hit-and-run driver had been found. But when I saw that person, it wasn't the figure in my memory.\n\nUntil a year ago, I accidentally saw Song Ming, and I recognized him. He was the real hit-and-run driver from back then.\n\nLater, one time when I was planning to sell my house through an agent, I met Zhao Kangyong, who was planning to buy a house. He bought my house, and sold his original house, planning to get a smaller one. Although he liked my house, it was a bit expensive, so he didn't buy it in the end. Later, we bumped into each other at a barbecue stall. Since we were both alone, we decided to share a table. Later, he would call me every time he went out drinking. When talking about why he was drinking alone, he mentioned his former colleague, a doctor.\n\nI also mentioned Song Ming. I said I wanted to kill him at the time, but it was just drunken talk. But he took it seriously. Later, under his persuasion, my desire to kill Song Ming grew stronger. Then he suggested that I kill Jing Liang, and he would kill Song Ming. I agreed. Just as we were planning how to do it, Zhao Kangyong and I were both pulled into a group. Besides the two of us, there were five other people.\n\nOne of them said he was an assistant director of a film crew. He directly told us his intention. He wanted to kill someone, but with today's advanced investigation techniques and ubiquitous cameras, it's not easy to kill someone. So, he wanted to plan a meticulous scheme that not only would leave no evidence for the police but also ensure his own escape.\n\nAlthough I was a bit scared at the time, listening to him explain it so clearly, we decided to do as he said. Later, he asked me to re-register a WeChat account and change the profile picture and nickname to match our respective targets.\n\nThere were a total of seven groups. My responsibility was to post Song Ming's chat content to the group without Song Ming, until a month ago when the assistant director notified us to prepare to act.\n\nTwo days later, I received a photo of Song Ming falling to his death. I don't know exactly how he did it.\n\nFinally, the assistant director said, \"Pleasant cooperation, take care of yourselves,\" and then disbanded the group.\n\nFor the past few days, I've been very uneasy. I've thought about committing suicide out of guilt, but I don't have the courage. I still have parents who need me to take care of them. This is my responsibility. If one day they are no longer around, I might really die and reunite with my wife and daughter.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei slowly said, \"So you want to take all the blame and be sentenced to death?\"\n\nGuo Jian nodded.\n\nLin Xiangbei sighed and said, \"You can rest for now.\"\n\nWith that, Shen Lingdong waved at Zhao Xiaofei and walked outside.\n\nOutside the interrogation room, Lin Xiangbei said to Zhao Xiaofei, \"I remember their house is not far from the real estate agency where Zhao Bo works. Go immediately and check which real estate agency sold his house.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Zhao Xiaofei quickly returned to the office.\n\nLin Xiangbei went to the monitoring room to check the interrogation status of others. The other three also confessed truthfully. Besides their individual stories, the specific procedures afterwards were exactly the same as what Zhang Ming and Guo Jian had said.\n\nNot long after, Zhao Xiaofei appeared in the monitoring room and said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Boss, Guo Jian's house was once listed on Zhao Bo's agency, but it wasn't sold by Zhao Bo.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Arrange for two people to keep an eye on Zhao Bo. Report any slightest disturbance to me.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nJust then, Lin Xiangbei's phone suddenly rang. He checked it and saw a message from Shen Lingdong: \"Arrest Zhao Bo immediately, he's trying to escape.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, then stopped Zhao Xiaofei and said, \"Xiao Fei, wait a moment. Bring Zhao Bo here directly. You can contact Shen Lingdong to find out Zhao Bo's location.\"\n\nZhao Xiaofei also frowned slightly, then walked outside.\n\n...\n\nAfter Shen Lingdong returned from the police station, he didn't stay at the company for long before his phone suddenly rang. It was Gao Qing's parents.\n\nThey had come to terms with it.\n\nThey wanted to clean up their son's room. They had originally planned for Gao Qing's mother to clean it herself, but she really couldn't do it. Although she accepted the fact that her son was dead, every item in the room evoked endless memories.\n\nSo, they asked Shen Lingdong to handle it.\n\nIt was only one room, and it wasn't very large. Shen Lingdong decided to go in person.\n\nAfter three hours, the room was tidied up. When he left this time, Shen Lingdong did not carry any garbage bags downstairs, only his tool bag.\n\nSome things should not be treated as trash, but cherished by those left alive.\n\nShen Lingdong did not charge any fee, only asked for a glass of water.\n\nOn the way back to the company, Shen Lingdong saw the real estate agency where Zhao Bo worked. After thinking for a moment, Shen Lingdong parked his car in front of the company.\n\nHowever, not long after, Shen Lingdong saw Zhao Bo come out of the agency, carrying a backpack, and get into a luxury car.\n\nShen Lingdong felt something was wrong, so he quickly sent a WeChat message to Lin Xiangbei, asking them to arrest Zhao Bo, and then quickly turned the car around and chased after him.\n\nShen Lingdong chased towards the suburbs for an hour.\n\nFinally, Zhao Bo's car crashed into a tree, and Zhao Bo quickly got out of the car and ran towards a nearby unfinished building. Shen Lingdong also quickly followed.\n\nThe sky was getting dark.\n\nZhao Bo's figure quickly disappeared from Shen Lingdong's sight.\n\nShen Lingdong cautiously moved into the unfinished building while sending his location to Zhao Xiaofei.\n\nJust then, a dark figure suddenly appeared at the staircase and ran upstairs.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly followed and soon reached the top floor.\n\nAt this moment, Zhao Bo was standing by the window.\n\nZhao Bo looked at Shen Lingdong, who was slowly approaching him, then smiled slightly and said, \"It seems I have no way to escape.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stopped about three meters away from Zhao Bo and slowly said, \"Running upwards when you know it's a dead end means you're either an idiot or a genius. I guess you deliberately led me here, intending to kill me.\"\n\n\"You knew and still followed? You could have waited for the police downstairs. I thought you were very smart, but I was wrong. You don't understand the principle of a wise person not standing in a precarious wall.\"\n\nShen Lingdong snorted coldly, \"Then we'll have to see who is the precarious wall?\"\n\nZhao Bo faced Shen Lingdong calmly, then took out a steel bar about the thickness of a thumb from behind him and weighed it in his hand.\n\nShen Lingdong calmly asked, \"Who is the director?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you after you die.\"\n\nWith that, Zhao Bo raised the steel bar and charged at Shen Lingdong...\n\nAfter a back-and-forth fight, both of them sustained some injuries. Shen Lingdong's arm took two solid blows, and there was a bit of blood on his lip. Fortunately, he was still standing. Zhao Bo lay on the ground with blood all over his face, his chest heaving violently.\n\nShen Lingdong kicked away the stick next to Zhao Bo, then leaned against a nearby pillar, covering his right shoulder with his left hand, and slowly asked, \"I want to know how you planned this case?\"\n\n\"You first... tell me, how did you realize I... had a problem?\" Zhao Bo said breathlessly.\n\n\"The moment you opened the door, I was momentarily blinded by the last ray of sunset. I suddenly remembered that the day I went to your company, in front of the Yuhai Villa, where you left footprints, I was chatting with a colleague. In that position, you couldn't see inside at all. You had to press close to the glass and shield it with your hand to see the environment clearly. The time that day perfectly matched the time you said you were at Yuhai Villa. I immediately understood that you already knew who was lying inside. You just needed to fabricate evidence at the door. However, this became your only flaw. If it weren't for this, it would have been a perfect crime. According to movie ratings, it would have at least scored 4.9.\"\n\nZhao Bo slightly raised his head, his blood-soaked eyes opening, but he couldn't see Shen Lingdong in the shadows. \"So that's how it is...\"\n\n\"A so-called perfect crime isn't about the police not knowing who the killer is, but rather that the police can't catch you even though they know who it is. That's also a perfect crime. If you could have killed me, you could have made up for your previous mistakes. Unfortunately, you won't have that chance... It's your turn to speak. What happened inside Yuhai Villa?\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhao Bo forced out a cold laugh with difficulty and slowly said, \"I impersonated Lu Fei and infiltrated them. When I arrived at the villa, Song Ming and Cao Jiazhi had already arrived before me. At that time, Cao Jiazhi was preparing lessons in his room. Since I was downstairs from him, I deliberately played music very loudly to disturb his preparations. He also came to find me. Of course, I had to guide him to the well-soundproofed study. However, to reduce suspicion on myself, I later found an excuse to go to the study, deliberately spilled his drink, and then I had a reason to appear in the study with gloves and a mop, and I successfully killed him without leaving any traces on myself.\"\n\n\"Of course, Song Ming knew I had been to the study, but I just needed to let Song Ming know in advance that I knew about his hit-and-run. I wanted him to want to kill me, but as long as I stayed with others, or others stayed with him, he couldn't kill me. Even if he knew I killed someone, so what?\"\n\n\"Although they all knew that someone had died in the room and were quite panicked, and I was the first to want to leave here, how could Song Ming let me leave? He came here to silence me, to prevent me from leaving, and persuaded me that I was the murderer of Cao Jiazhi. But they could only guess, and had no evidence, so they chose to isolate me. The five of them banded together in the entertainment room to discuss how to deal with me.\"\n\n\"This coincidentally gave me the opportunity to act alone. Anyway, I didn't need anyone to accompany me. It can be said that the reason most of them stayed was to kill me. And the appearance of Lu Fei's real body could cause them to fall apart.\"",

    "content": "Special Scene Cleaner, Volume 117: The Truth\n\nTang Feng waited outside the interrogation room for a long time. Upon seeing Lin Xiangbei emerge, he immediately approached with a voice recorder and said, \"Captain Lin, after you left, Shen Lingdong confessed. I've recorded the entire conversation.\"\n\n\"Mm, I'll listen later. I have some leads to sort out right now,\" Lin Xiangbei quickened his pace.\n\nTang Feng hurried to keep up, starting to play the recording of his conversation with Shen Lingdong.\n\nAs Lin Xiangbei walked upstairs, he casually listened to the recording.\n\nWhen the recording ended, Lin Xiangbei suddenly stopped and looked at Tang Feng, asking, \"Did Shen Lingdong tell you this?\"\n\nTang Feng nodded and said, \"He volunteered the information.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and said, \"I understand. Hu Guangming and Wang Lan have confessed. I'm currently interrogating Song Changtu. You can go take a look at the statements from the other two. After you read them, you'll understand what's going on.\"\n\nTang Feng frowned.\n\nLin Xiangbei then went into his office. A moment later, he came out with a document and returned to Song Changtu's interrogation room.\n\nArriving at Song Changtu's interrogation room, Lin Xiangbei asked Song Changtu, \"Have you thought about it? Are you going to tell the truth? Your two accomplices have already confessed.\"\n\nSong Changtu looked up at Lin Xiangbei and slowly said, \"I'm telling the truth.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei felt much more relaxed at this point and smiled slightly at Song Changtu, saying, \"Of course, I believe most of what you're saying is true, but I want to hear all of it.\"\n\nSong Changtu shook his head slightly and said, \"There's nothing more to say.\"\n\n\"If you don't want to say it, I can say it for you. You were actually the superior of Hu Guangming and Wang Lan. Your original target was Wang Jizhong. Because Sun Yong was involved in a hit-and-run and was facing police capture, you were forced to change your target to Zhao Xiaofei, who was injured in the car accident. Furthermore, because Sun Yong knew your identity, you silenced him.\"\n\nSong Changtu pondered for a moment and said, \"That explanation makes sense, but you have no evidence.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, we'll find evidence soon. We've already started searching your home, and we'll find it shortly,\" Lin Xiangbei said, his gaze fixed on Song Changtu.\n\nUpon hearing Lin Xiangbei's words, Song Changtu lowered his head slightly, and the corners of his mouth involuntarily curled up.\n\nLin Xiangbei caught this subtle reaction and, with a hint of suspicion in his eyes, asked Song Changtu, \"I'm very curious. You used yourself as bait to frame Shen Lingdong. Aren't you afraid of a bad outcome, where you get yourself caught too?\"\n\n\"I didn't frame him; I'm telling the facts.\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm bluffing? What I have here are the statements from Hu Guangming and Wang Lan, with their signatures. However, they are both self-serving individuals. Do you know what self-serving individuals might do in this situation?\" Lin Xiangbei said.\n\n\"They'll say they were forced. As long as their families aren't found, they're in danger of being kidnapped, which could imply they were coerced, potentially leading to reduced or exempt responsibility under the law,\" Song Changtu replied.\n\nLin Xiangbei smiled slightly and said, \"You know quite a lot. According to your records, your education level isn't very high. You seem to be quite familiar with the law.\"\n\n\"I like to study.\"\n\n\"I doubt that's the case. I looked into a robbery case from six years ago on Jiangnan Road. A young girl was robbed, and a middle-aged woman happened to witness it. She was a sanitation worker. She cleverly used a trash can to trip the robber. Although the robber fell, he had a knife, and due to the indifference of bystanders, no one intervened. Fortunately, the girl's bag was recovered, but the wallet inside was missing.\n\nInitially, everyone assumed the robber had taken the wallet. However, soon after, a young man brought the robber back. The girl's wallet was not found on the robber. Although the girl had some suspicions, she didn't say much. But the middle-aged woman faced criticism. Because of this incident, she fell ill and passed away within a year.\n\nThe middle-aged woman's husband, to get justice for his wife, taught himself law and filed a lawsuit against the court. He wanted to sue everyone in society who was indifferent. Because there was no specific defendant, the lawsuit was dismissed. However, we all heard about this internally, and at the time, we all admired the middle-aged woman's husband. This person was you, wasn't he? And the person who caught the robber was Shen Lingdong, who was studying at the police academy.\"\n\nAt this moment, Song Changtu sighed slightly and said, \"When those people face someone stronger than themselves, even if the stronger person is wrong, they remain indifferent. But when they learn that the weaker party has made a mistake, their sense of justice erupts, and they show no mercy. My wife was killed by them.\"\n\n\"But have you considered if your wife actually kept that money? After the onlookers dispersed, the girl searched along the road many times. Although the money in the wallet wasn't a lot, there was a photo of her and her father in it, which was very important to her. She searched that road many times.\n\nFortunately, the wallet was found the next day, right outside the police station, by a police officer. The officer found the girl through the identification inside. However, the girl had something else to attend to and couldn't get there immediately. The matter should have ended there, but that police officer extracted fingerprints from the wallet and found two sets of prints: the first belonged to the robber, and the second belonged to your wife.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lin Xiangbei took out two pictures from the table and continued, \"This is the fingerprint lifted from the wallet. This photo is of your wife's fingerprint. If your wife hadn't touched the wallet, how would her fingerprint have gotten on it?\"\n\n\"My wife wouldn't do something like that. It's not strange for her fingerprint to be on it if she found the wallet.\"\n\n\"Indeed. But do you know why the court didn't accept your lawsuit? After receiving your lawsuit, the court took it very seriously and immediately launched an investigation. They found a surveillance video. The robber, while fleeing, saw a trash can ahead and intended to take the wallet out and throw the bag into the trash can. However, while taking out the wallet, he was distracted and didn't notice his footing, and was tripped by the trash can that your wife had pushed over. The wallet in the robber's hand was flung under a car parked nearby. After everyone left, your wife took advantage of the scene cleanup to retrieve the wallet from under the car. To accommodate your perception of your wife, the court refused your lawsuit on the grounds of no specific defendant.\"\n\n\"This is the truth of the entire incident.\"\n\n7017k",

    "content": "Song Changtu, still in disbelief, looked at Lin Xiangbei with disdain and retorted, \"What kind of policeman would be so bored as to dust for fingerprints on a lost wallet?\"\n\n\"Me,\" Lin Xiangbei said softly. \"I wasn't the captain of the criminal investigation team back then. I was in the forensics department. I found it suspicious that an empty wallet appeared at the police station's entrance. The city was intensifying its efforts against pickpocketing at the time, and as a police officer, I wanted to contribute. I also collected fingerprints from that wallet.\"\n\nSong Changtu raised an eyebrow slightly and said, \"No wonder they call you the 'Master Detective of Dongjiang City.' You're quite good at grasping at straws.\"\n\n\"I'm not a master detective. The reason I became captain of the criminal investigation team isn't because of my exceptional case-solving abilities. I just don't let any doubts or minor details go unchecked. I'll investigate every little thing. It's just diligence compensating for clumsiness,\" Lin Xiangbei leaned against the table.\n\n\"Then why do you trust Shen Lingdong so much?\" Song Changtu asked.\n\n\"I trust Shen Lingdong's colleagues, and I suspect him.\"\n\n\"Don't those conflict?\" Song Changtu asked with a laugh.\n\n\"They don't conflict. My trust in him was born from suspicion. From the first moment I met him, I suspected him. He didn't explain, but instead used his actions to prove his innocence. This time is the same. You say Shen Lingdong is the mastermind. It's certainly possible, and the motive is very strong. His father was an ordinary person, but he was Shen Lingdong's idol since childhood. In his eyes, his father could do anything, but he was definitely not the killer. When he learned that his father was the real killer, his core beliefs collapsed, and it's entirely possible he might do something extreme. However, he needs the truth, like a ray of sunlight in the darkness, to support him. That's his sense of justice. I can see that light in him. If I ever stop seeing that light in him, I will personally send him to prison.\"\n\nSong Changtu snorted, \"The truth? The truth is sometimes cruel. You letting me know the truth has also destroyed the image of her in my heart.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei continued, \"Your wife's actions constituted theft. However, because the amount was small and the owner did not intend to pursue charges, we did not pursue it further. But she still needed to be reprimanded and educated. I went to find your wife. Do you want to know what she told me?\"\n\n\"What did she say?\" Song Changtu quickly asked.\n\n\"There was 238 yuan in the wallet. When I found it, she returned 193 yuan to me. She spent 40 yuan: 14 yuan for registration fees and 31 yuan for painkillers. During that time, you were immersed in mahjong, and all the money at home was lost. She had a terrible stomach ache but didn't dare to tell you. Your son couldn't find a job outside and was hiding alone in a rental room, eating steamed buns and preserved vegetables. When your wife went to see a doctor, she couldn't even afford the registration fee and had to resort to this method to get an appointment. Later, I checked at the hospital. The doctor, based on her condition, suspected stomach cancer and needed her to undergo an examination. But because the cost was too high, she gave up and only bought some painkillers.\"\n\n\"Don't say any more,\" Song Changtu said, his eyes reddening.\n\n\"I didn't take that money. I left 1,000 yuan for your wife to get a check-up at the hospital. But in the end, that money was transferred to your son.\"\n\n\"Don't say any more!\" Song Changtu roared, his face turning red. After a moment, he calmed down and said softly, \"I'm sorry for her. After she left, I quit gambling and started working hard. However, she followed me for so many years and never got to live a good life. Are you telling me all this so I'll confess? I've already confessed, it's just that you don't believe me.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei shook his head slightly and then said, \"I just want you to know that what you understand might not be the truth. According to you, your superior was Shen Lingdong. But I found out that during your gambling period, you owed a debt. However, after your wife passed away, that debt mysteriously disappeared. I suspect someone used that debt to buy you off, likely the Shen Lingdong you mentioned. That was also around the time Shen Lingdong's father was imprisoned. As far as I know, that was not an easy period. If Shen Lingdong had money to buy you off, would he let his mother continue working as a cleaner? Based on my understanding, he wouldn't. That's why I infer that you are framing Shen Lingdong.\"\n\nSong Changtu frowned and then said, \"I want to see Shen Lingdong.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei shook his head slightly, \"No. Whatever you want to say, I can convey it for you.\"\n\n\"Just one sentence. The director also hopes he will find the truth,\" Song Changtu said, then looked up at Lin Xiangbei and smiled, \"Go and tell him now. Tell me what he replies, and I will tell you everything you want to know, limited to the Sun Yong case. Regarding the film crew and the director, I'll tell you as much as I know.\"\n\n\"Wait here,\" Lin Xiangbei left the interrogation room and walked towards the lounge.\n\n...\n\nIn the lounge, Shen Lingdong was eating a box lunch. He hadn't eaten all day and had ordered a box lunch under Gu Caiwei's name.\n\nWhile eating, Shen Lingdong chatted with Gu Caiwei. Shen Lingdong's plan to feign a confession had completely failed, and he no longer held out hope. He could only pin his hopes on Lin Xiangbei uncovering something important during his interrogation.\n\nAt this moment, Liang Yinxi suddenly pushed the door open and entered the lounge, greeting Shen Lingdong and Gu Caiwei.\n\nGu Caiwei quickly stood up and replied to Liang Yinxi, \"Sister Xi, do you need me for something?\"\n\nSeeing this, Shen Lingdong also quickly put down his chopsticks and stood up.\n\nLiang Yinxi smiled slightly and looked at Shen Lingdong, saying, \"I'm looking for Shen Lingdong.\"\n\nGu Caiwei looked surprised. Sister Xi was usually cold, rarely smiled, and rarely asked for favors. Why was she suddenly looking for Shen Lingdong? Shen Lingdong was indeed too impressive, someone who could make Sister Xi visit in person. Whatever she was seeking must be something extraordinary.\n\nLiang Yinxi sat down next to Shen Lingdong and asked softly, \"How much do you usually charge for cleaning...\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback and then replied, \"Does Sister Xi's house need cleaning? Then it's free.\"\n\n\"That won't do. It should be whatever the usual price is. It's almost New Year's, and I don't have time to go back and help my parents clean their room. Their health isn't good, and I don't want them to exert themselves. I'll give you the money now. When you go to my parents' house, just say you're from the bureau's cleaning team, providing free cleaning services for family members.\"\n\n\"Oh, no problem. But I can't accept this money.\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei hesitated beside them and mused, \"I think everyone in the bureau should enjoy this kind of treatment.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly shook his head and then said, \"I can't handle that much work. I'll help Sister Xi first.\"\n\nLiang Yinxi smiled slightly again and said, \"Then it's settled. Add me on WeChat, and I'll transfer the money to you. I'll send you the address too.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately took out his phone and added Sister Xi on WeChat.\n\nAfterward, Sister Xi prepared to leave. As she was leaving, she glanced at the box lunch next to Shen Lingdong and then said, \"Your food...\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Liang Yinxi blankly and quickly retorted, \"It's delicious.\"\n\n\"It's quite similar to the food in Sun Yong's stomach,\" Liang Yinxi then left.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the food beside him, slowly picked it up, and continued eating.\n\nHowever, his chopsticks gradually stopped.\n\n\"What's wrong, are you disgusted?\" Gu Caiwei asked.\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head slightly and said, \"If Sun Yong was preparing to commit a murder, would Song Changtu have seen him off and treated him to a meal? This kind of food is likely takeout. If we can find it on Song Changtu's or Sun Yong's phone, it might prove they knew each other.\"",

    "content": "**Chapter 119: Case Closed**\n\nGu Caiwei, after a brief recollection, felt this was indeed a lead and promptly got up to investigate.\n\nNot long after she left, Lin Xiangbei entered the lounge again. It was a police lounge, yet it was quite popular, with people coming and going incessantly.\n\nUpon seeing Lin Xiangbei, Shen Lingdong eagerly asked, \"Any new leads?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei smiled slightly and said, \"Song Changtu is ready to confess.\"\n\n\"Ready?\" Shen Lingdong looked at Lin Xiangbei with a puzzled expression.\n\n\"He has something he wants me to relay to you. He said the director also hopes you will uncover the truth. He originally wanted to see you personally, but I refused,\" Lin Xiangbei said softly.\n\nShen Lingdong's face showed a hint of confusion, and he then asked, \"Does the director mean he wants me to put him away?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei remained noncommittal. \"I'm just worried there are hidden details. Do you have anything you want to tell him?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment before slowly saying, \"No.\"\n\nThis answer surprised Lin Xiangbei greatly, and he quickly said, \"I thought you'd reply, 'I will definitely uncover the truth' or something similar.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to say,\" Shen Lingdong replied softly.\n\n\"Alright, I'll go back and tell him this. Wait here for me,\" Lin Xiangbei said with a smile and left.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and continued to wait for Lin Xiangbei in the lounge.\n\nTwo hours later, Lin Xiangbei returned to the lounge. His expression was the complete opposite of when he left; it was now very somber.\n\nSeeing this, Shen Lingdong quickly asked, \"What's wrong? Did he go back on his word?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei shook his head slightly. \"He has confessed. Sun Yong was indeed killed by him, and it's mostly as you said. His initial target was Wang Jizhong, but there was a minor complication. They were supposed to commit the crime at Wang Jizhong's home, and they had prepared a method to destroy the evidence: after killing Wang Jizhong, they would destroy the surveillance video evidence from the property management. However, Wang Jizhong wasn't home at the time. Although there was a deviation from the plan, Wang Jizhong's location at the time was also very suitable for the crime. Sun Yong had a car accident while on his way to Wang Jizhong's location.\"\n\n\"At the time, Sun Yong was carrying important clues, which were the murder plans provided by Song Changtu to Sun Yong. Sun Yong called Song Changtu for help while fleeing, and Song Changtu told him to escape to a nearby shopping mall. The method used was the same as how they brought Zhao Xiaofei out of the hospital – using a trash can.\"\n\n\"Afterward, Song Changtu disguised himself as a cleaner, entered the mall, and left with a trash can. However, the rooftop was not the primary crime scene. It was under a bridge not far away. He killed Sun Yong there. Even if blood splattered, in that cold weather, the melted snow would freeze it again. He took all the frozen blood from the scene and tried his best to place it around the original splatter positions, making the rooftop look like the primary crime scene. This way, he would have an alibi and could also mislead the police.\"\n\n\"However, he didn't expect the weather to suddenly warm up, which ruined his fabricated primary crime scene. But he did put the note from the trash can into Sun Yong's hand, which is precisely why we mistakenly believed Sun Yong had appeared at the hospital and naturally assumed the rooftop was the primary crime scene. If we had discovered earlier that it wasn't the primary crime scene, the investigation would have been much easier, and you wouldn't have been a suspect. This is primarily my fault, and I apologize to you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong waved his hand and said, \"At the time, our main priority was to find Zhao Xiaofei. We never thoroughly analyzed the case of Sun Yong's death. Regardless, the Sun Yong case is solved. What about that Zhou Xinghuai?\"\n\nUpon hearing Zhou Xinghuai's name, Lin Xiangbei's expression became serious again. \"He was also very confused about our arrest. He wasn't involved in this case at all. He wasn't even very clear about secretly hiding the murder instructions in the script. However, he suspected he was betrayed and promptly revealed everything he knew about the 'crew.' I've combined the statements of Song Changtu and Zhou Xinghuai. Zhou Xinghuai was one of the financial personnel in the crew, mainly responsible for financial matters. They recruited many people by using debt and threats to make them work for him. For each murder committed, they would receive a high bonus, and everyone involved would get paid, with some people not even knowing they were participating in a murder.\"\n\n\"Zhou Xinghuai's arrest has exposed a significant network. By apprehending him, all his subordinates have been exposed, undoubtedly dealing a heavy blow to the crew.\"\n\nShen Lingdong's face showed a smile. \"Isn't that a good thing?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded. \"Indeed. However, he also revealed the director's motive. He once heard that the director's family was involved in a murder case, and they were sentenced to life imprisonment. However, the director believed his family was innocent of the murder, and that the police fabricated false charges to solve the case. Because you and he have similar experiences, it appears he is targeting you and planning to mold you into the new director. In reality, he is targeting the entire police force in Dongjiang City. By having you uncover the truth, he undoubtedly wants you to overturn the case for your father and for the director's family. If both cases are proven to be wrongful convictions, our police force will face unprecedented pressure, and our credibility will be reduced. We will no longer be trusted by the public in Dongjiang City, which is a terrifying prospect.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was stunned and hesitated for a moment before saying, \"And the forged fingerprint case in Shengjing City. Once fingerprints can no longer serve as valid evidence, the crime rate will rise sharply. Not only will Dongjiang City be in chaos, but the entire country will be in turmoil.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and replied, \"That's what I'm worried about.\"\n\n\"Could it be infiltration by foreign forces?\"\n\n\"I suspect that's also a possibility. However, at least we now know that the director's family was sentenced to life imprisonment. As long as I get the list and investigate them one by one, I can definitely find the director.\"\n\nAt this point, Shen Lingdong slowly said, \"Do you also suspect my father's case was a wrongful conviction now?\"\n\n\"I don't know. This case was always suspicious. Even my master is unsure. If it was truly a wrongful conviction, my master would probably not be able to continue being a police officer...\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and said nothing.\n\nLin Xiangbei stood up, patted Shen Lingdong on the shoulder, and said, \"Go back and rest. Also, if you have time, help me persuade Zhao Xiaofei. I still suggest he stay in the criminal investigation team.\"\n\n7017k",

    "content": "Special Scene Cleaner Main Story Volume Chapter 120 Plan\n\nDecember 31st.\n\nSeveral days had passed since the Sun Yong case was solved. Zhao Xiaofei’s physical condition had recovered well, and he had been discharged from the hospital to rest at home. Although Lin Xiangbei had tried his best to keep Zhao Xiaofei, he had still submitted his resignation.\n\nLin Xiangbei did not approve it immediately, only asking him to recuperate for now and revisit it after his full recovery.\n\nThese past few days in Dongjiang City had been much quieter, with no major incidents.\n\nLin Xiangbei then saw a transfer application form on his desk. Tang Feng had proactively applied to be transferred out of the Dongjiang City Criminal Police Detachment.\n\nLooking at the form, Lin Xiangbei sent Tang Feng a message asking him to come to his office. Before long, Tang Feng appeared in Lin Xiangbei’s office.\n\nUpon seeing Lin Xiangbei, Tang Feng immediately asked, \"Captain Lin, has my application been approved?\"\n\n\"Not yet. If you regret it, you can take it back now,\" Lin Xiangbei said softly.\n\n\"I won't regret it,\" Tang Feng replied.\n\n\"The Sun Yong case is closed. The mastermind has been identified, and even Song Changtu's superior has been arrested. Do you still think Shen Lingdong is problematic?\"\n\nTang Feng nodded and said, \"Yes, Captain Lin.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei gave a wry smile. \"You're not suspecting Shen Lingdong, you're doubting our investigative capabilities. However, I believe there might be a misunderstanding between you and Shen Lingdong. You can choose to stay in the Criminal Police Detachment and find an opportunity to reconcile with Shen Lingdong, just like Shen Lingdong and Zhao Xiaofei. I actually think highly of you. If you can settle down and let go of your obsession, the position of Criminal Police Captain will be yours sooner or later.\"\n\nTang Feng shook his head slightly. \"I'd rather return to my original unit. Since I said I would leave the Criminal Police Detachment if Shen Lingdong wasn't the mastermind, now is the time to fulfill that promise. Please sign it, Captain Lin.\"\n\nSeeing Tang Feng's attitude, Lin Xiangbei knew he had no intention of staying in the Criminal Police Detachment. It wasn't that he didn't want to solve cases; he just wanted to solve Shen Lingdong's case. From Lin Xiangbei's understanding, the two of them were rivals in love before. Even so, Tang Feng shouldn't be targeting Shen Lingdong to this extent. Was there something else between them?\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Lin Xiangbei slowly raised his hand, picked up a pen, and signed the application. He then said to Tang Feng, \"You can go back now. I'll take the application to Director Sun.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Captain Lin,\" Tang Feng said softly before turning and leaving Lin Xiangbei's office.\n\nLin Xiangbei took out another form from his drawer, picked it up along with Tang Feng's transfer letter, and then headed towards Director Sun's office.\n\nArriving at Director Sun’s office, Lin Xiangbei knocked and then entered the room.\n\nSeeing Lin Xiangbei appear, Director Sun’s face broke into a smile. \"This time, you solved the Sun Yong case, captured the killer Song Changtu, and even his superior Zhou Xinghuai. You've made a great contribution! Through Zhou Xinghuai, the police in Shengjing City dismantled a fingerprint forgery ring. They highly praised your abilities.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and said, \"Actually, I didn't do much. Everyone worked hard, including Tang Feng and Shen Lingdong.\"\n\nDirector Sun nodded lightly, his smile gradually fading. He asked Lin Xiangbei, \"I heard that Tang Feng, who was just transferred here, is planning to leave?\"\n\n\"Yes, I came to get your signature,\" Lin Xiangbei said as he placed Tang Feng's transfer letter in front of Director Sun.\n\nDirector Sun glanced at it briefly and then set it aside. He then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Keeping a police officer like that in the force might cause trouble for you one day. Don't worry, I'll help you request a few more people from other branches.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated slightly and then said, \"I want one person.\"\n\n\"Who?\" Director Sun asked with a smile.\n\n\"Shen Lingdong.\" Lin Xiangbei immediately placed the application for the criminal investigation consultant in front of Director Sun.\n\nThe smile on Director Sun’s face vanished instantly. He then said, \"Didn't we sign off on that last time? And didn't he not want to be a consultant?\"\n\n\"My face might not be enough, so I'd like you to personally persuade him,\" Lin Xiangbei said with a smile.\n\nDirector Sun frowned, his expression becoming serious. \"I spoke with him briefly before...\"\n\n\"He refused?\" Lin Xiangbei asked back.\n\nDirector Sun looked up at Lin Xiangbei and then said, \"I was talking to him about something else. A while ago, Xie Yingxiong talked to me about something. He told me that the director’s film crew was a large and complex criminal organization, and our current investigation was too passive. So, he wanted to take the initiative.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, looking at Director Sun with confusion.\n\nDirector Sun continued, \"Plant an undercover agent in the film crew. Moreover, through this case, we also know that the film crew has been trying to recruit Shen Lingdong, so he is the ideal candidate. Only Xie Yingxiong and I know about this, and neither of us intends to interfere. The director is very vigilant. If we send Shen Lingdong to prison, and they sense something, Shen Lingdong's situation could become very dangerous. Therefore, Xie Yingxiong and I decided to let things unfold naturally, which is why I transferred Tang Feng, who has had a conflict with Shen Lingdong, over here.\"\n\n\"However, I overlooked one thing, which is the matter of Song Changtu's wife. I forgot that you were involved. No one expected this matter to become your breakthrough in cracking Song Changtu's case, leading to the investigation's success. This also caused Xie Yingxiong's and my plan for Shen Lingdong to become an undercover agent to fail.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei suddenly understood and said to Director Sun, \"No wonder Shen Lingdong told me he wanted to take responsibility for the crime, but I refused him. I'm sorry, Director Sun, I didn't realize your intentions.\"\n\nDirector Sun smiled and then said, \"However, we now know the film crew's objective, which is a major breakthrough. Moreover, the subsequent investigation will not be as aimless as before. I'm telling you this so that you can be informed of the next undercover plan.\"\n\n\"Is there still a way for Shen Lingdong to become an undercover agent?\" Lin Xiangbei quickly asked.\n\n\"It's impossible for him to be an undercover agent anymore. Xie Yingxiong and I have found better candidates.\"\n\n\"Who?\" Lin Xiangbei asked urgently.\n\nDirector Sun’s gaze fell on Tang Feng's transfer letter next to him. \"If he returns to his original unit, as long as he doesn't make any major mistakes, he can be a police officer his whole life and basically won't have any more contact with Shen Lingdong. But if he joins the task force, he will have a lot of contact with Shen Lingdong in the future. Only Shen Lingdong can make him make a mistake, and only when he makes a mistake can we send him to the director.\"\n\n\"So, Shen Lingdong must be a consultant,\" Lin Xiangbei continued.\n\nDirector Sun nodded.\n\n7017k",

    "content": "Chapter 121: Consultant Approaches\n\nAs the Lunar New Year approached, Shen Lingdong's cleaning company suddenly became busy.\n\nFurthermore, with Dongjiang City having been peaceful lately and no homicides occurring, the members of the Special Scene Cleanup Team had been idle for many days.\n\nWang Jizhong and Zheng Daoguang had proactively requested to take on ordinary cleaning tasks. Perhaps it was because they couldn't stand being idle, but it wasn't likely for the money, as both of their wages were donated to the Aftercare Team.\n\nToday was New Year's Day, the first day of the new year, and there wasn't a single cleaning job. Shen Lingdong decided to give everyone a holiday and stayed alone to man the company.\n\nHis mother, Li Xianglan, visited in the morning and left after a while.\n\nJust as Li Xianglan left, Shen Lingdong noticed a bag her mother had left on the table. Thinking she had forgotten it, he called her. Li Xianglan told Shen Lingdong that she had left the bag intentionally and wanted him to look inside.\n\nShen Lingdong casually opened the bag. Inside was a notebook, his mother's diary written to his father.\n\nFlipping through a few pages, the entries were all about trivial matters. His mother had even given him the task of cleaning the rooms of young women, wanting him to interact with more girls...\n\nShen Lingdong flipped to yesterday's entry:\n\nDecember 31, 2021. Sunny.\n\nIt's very cold today. Shen Lingdong didn't wear much when he went out. He's been very busy lately, coming home late every day. I don't know what he's been doing, but compared to his usual melancholy expression, his current state seems much better. Could he be dating someone? I wonder how things are progressing with that policewoman?\n\nShen Lingdong gave a wry smile and instinctively turned to the next page, only to find that the diary had ended.\n\nHowever, tucked within the diary was a note from his mother to Shen Lingdong: \"I'm giving you this diary. It's a new year, and it's time for some new changes. If you have anything you want to say to your father in the future, write it down. I'll pass it on to him. You must write it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stared blankly at the diary until he heard knocking downstairs. He then put the diary into a drawer and walked downstairs.\n\nArriving downstairs, he saw a figure peering through the glass at the inside.\n\nShen Lingdong opened the door and saw Lin Xiangbei standing at the entrance. \"Captain Lin, why are you here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Can't I come?\" Lin Xiangbei retorted. Before Shen Lingdong could invite him in, he walked in, pulled over a chair, and sat down.\n\n\"Of course, you can,\" Shen Lingdong said, filling a cup with hot water from the heater and handing it to Lin Xiangbei.\n\n\"Let's get down to business. Bring your company's business license and financial statements here. I want to see if there are any issues,\" Lin Xiangbei said to Shen Lingdong with a poker face.\n\n\"Is this any of your business?\" Shen Lingdong retorted.\n\n\"How is it not our business?\" Lin Xiangbei stood up, surveyed the shelves, and continued, \"I suspect these are all dangerous goods. Shen Lingdong, please cooperate with the police inspection.\"\n\n\"What is this all about?\" Shen Lingdong asked, confused.\n\nLin Xiangbei then said, \"The New Year is approaching, so we need to be more vigilant. But if you don't want me to inspect, that's fine too. Just sign this.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei took a contract from his bag and placed it on the table.\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at it. It was still the contract for hiring him as a criminal investigation consultant. He then said, \"To be honest, I still don't want to sign. First, the police hiring the son of a murderer as a consultant will create significant public opinion pressure, especially at this critical juncture. We already know their goal is to destroy the police's credibility. The police absolutely cannot create more trouble. Second, and this is the point I value most, if I sign this contract, my actions will be under your supervision. While I can participate in various cases immediately, there's one case I will have to recuse myself from, and that's a case I absolutely will not recuse myself from.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you're worried about not being able to investigate your father's case,\" Lin Xiangbei replied softly. \"The police's credibility... do you trust me? I believe you gave me this contract, but I also ask that you truly trust us, the police. Although your father is in prison, there's also the advantage that he can't commit any more crimes. If you find any evidence during your investigation that can be linked to that previous case, if there's such evidence, I will definitely help you get your father out.\"\n\nShen Lingdong remained silent. He trusted the police, but...\n\nLin Xiangbei continued, \"When it comes to abilities, everyone naturally believes those with strong abilities more. Everyone has witnessed your capabilities. Rather than trusting the police, you prefer to trust yourself, which is understandable. But no matter how strong your personal abilities are, you're still fumbling in the dark. I'm giving you a boat ticket now, and I hope you'll board our passenger ship. Also, an important point: once your father is proven innocent and the case is unrelated to your father, you won't have to recuse yourself. Moreover, by leveraging the consultant position, it's not impossible for you to be exceptionally appointed as a police officer.\"\n\nShen Lingdong swallowed. His resolve was beginning to waver.\n\nSeeing this, Lin Xiangbei added, \"Also, let me tell you something. I don't know what the special investigation team saw in Tang Feng, but he's been transferred to the special investigation team. It will be even easier for him to find trouble with you. However, with the consultant status, the situation will be somewhat different.\"\n\nShen Lingdong still said nothing.\n\nSeeing that Shen Lingdong still hadn't agreed, Lin Xiangbei had to speak again, \"Gu Caiwei's Aftercare Team is developing well, and it was Gu Caiwei who apprehended the big fish, Zhou Xinghuai, this time. The higher-ups are also very interested in Gu Caiwei. As long as I sign, she'll also report to the special investigation team tomorrow... Additionally, Tang Feng's former girlfriend, dissatisfied with him joining the criminal investigation team, has already broken up with him.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at Lin Xiangbei, then picked up a pen and signed the contract. As he signed, he said, \"The moment you mentioned my father, I agreed. It has nothing to do with Tang Feng or Gu Caiwei. I was just a bit emotional and am only now coming to my senses.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at the contract, then put it back in his bag. He leaned over the table and whispered mysteriously to Shen Lingdong, \"Everyone can see the situation between you and Gu Caiwei. Picking her up from work no matter how late it is every day isn't something ordinary classmates would do. I already know about your past with Director Sun. You're not going to have reservations about your relationship because of this, are you?\"\n\nShen Lingdong blinked slightly, then said, \"Director Sun has already told you? It seems this plan can't be implemented. However, he only found me recently, and it has nothing to do with Gu Caiwei.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei stood up and walked to a piece of calligraphy and painting. He softly recited, \"When the dynasty has no recluse, all heroic spirits return. The next line of this poem is 'Thus, the man from Dongshan, cannot look back at Gu Caiwei,' isn't it?\"\n\n\"This calligraphy and painting was given to me by the director.\"\n\n\"You're not afraid of implicating Gu Caiwei, are you?\"\n\n\"This poem mentions Lingdong and Gu Caiwei, but it's a poem to comfort a friend. The appearance of both our names might be a coincidence. Moreover, the style of this poem is not sad; instead, it's uplifting and inspires engagement with the world. I suspect the director's intention might also be to have me become a police officer. As for implicating Gu Caiwei? That's not what I'm worried about, and I also don't really agree with that approach. If my father is acquitted, I will actively seek out Gu Caiwei. At that moment, I... have been planning this for a long time...\"",

    "content": "Chapter 122: The Stranger\n\nAfter Lin Xiangbei left, Shen Lingdong looked around the company and then fetched some hot water to start a major cleaning. After all, it was a new year and a fresh start was necessary.\n\nBefore long, the door was suddenly pushed open, and Yuan Yuan appeared at the entrance. Seeing Shen Lingdong mopping the floor, she asked with a hint of confusion, \"Brother Shen, are you improving your professional skills?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at Yuan Yuan and then asked, \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"I was out shopping with Di Fang, but he was called away by his boyfriend halfway through. He left me, a single dog, here. I happened to be nearby, so I figured I’d hang out at the company for a bit and do some writing.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and then slowly said, \"Since you're not here for work, you'll have to cover the electricity costs yourself.\"\n\n\"You cheapskate!\" Yuan Yuan complained, then walked to the desk and opened her laptop.\n\n\"Writing something new again?\"\n\n\"I have to make money. Why don't you give me a raise?\" Yuan Yuan retorted.\n\n\"Then you should just keep writing.\"\n\nA moment later, the sound of rapid typing came from Yuan Yuan's side. Shen Lingdong continued mopping. Suddenly, Shen Lingdong remembered something and asked Yuan Yuan, \"By the way, I heard that writing murder mystery scripts is quite profitable. Have you ever written one?\"\n\nThe sound of Yuan Yuan's keyboard immediately stopped, and she then said, \"Of course. I'm a prolific writer. I usually write one murder mystery script a month, and I have channels. I used to sell them through a murder mystery game cafe, but… after you guys arrested them, that cafe closed down, and my source of income was cut off.\"\n\n\"They weren't the only cafe, were they? How much do you earn per script?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Anything from five thousand to tens of thousands, depending on the quality of the script.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and then asked, \"Teach me how to write them. I want to earn some extra cash. Don't let the company's current profits fool you; my mom manages all the money, and I don't have a cent.\"\n\nYuan Yuan hesitated slightly, then found a few documents on her computer and sent them to Shen Lingdong's phone. She then said, \"These are a few scripts I wrote before. You can use them as a reference. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.\" With that, Yuan Yuan started typing again.\n\nShen Lingdong opened the documents and took a look, then asked, \"This looks very difficult.\"\n\nYuan Yuan stopped again and said, \"This isn't picking up money from the ground.\"\n\nJust as Yuan Yuan was about to start typing again, she paused with her hands hovering in mid-air for a long time. Then, with an angry expression, she looked at Shen Lingdong and said, \"Forget it. I'll help you mop instead. You've completely disrupted my train of thought.\"\n\n\"Does writing require a specific atmosphere?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Of course. Only by immersing yourself and empathizing can you write a good work.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded thoughtfully.\n\nJust then, the phone on Yuan Yuan's desk suddenly rang. Yuan Yuan immediately answered and, after a few responses, picked up a pen and wrote down an address on a piece of paper. After hanging up, Yuan Yuan handed the note to Shen Lingdong and said, \"We have a job. Yuan Nan residential area, Building 7, Unit 5, Apartment 802. Some friends were having a New Year's Eve party, drank too much, and vomited all over the place.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Shen Lingdong replied softly, then took the note. After a glance, he looked up at Yuan Yuan and said, \"Why don't you come with me?\"\n\nYuan Yuan looked at Shen Lingdong helplessly and retorted, \"Do I have any other choice?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head slightly.\n\nThe two of them prepared their tools, got into the car, and drove towards Yuan Nan residential area. Upon arriving at the designated location, Shen Lingdong knocked on the door.\n\nA moment later, a young man in pajamas opened the door. He looked about twenty-three or twenty-four years old. \"Hello, we're from Sunshine Cleaning. Is this your place that needs cleaning?\"\n\nThe man sized up Shen Lingdong, then his gaze settled on Yuan Yuan. He said dismissively, \"Come in.\"\n\nThe two put on shoe covers and entered the room. The apartment was a mess. Empty beer cans littered the floor, and the tableware on the table was askew. From the dining room to the bathroom, there were several puddles of vomit, making it almost impossible to find a clean spot to step. Shen Lingdong looked up. There were even some stains on the chandelier in the living room, and some broken glass bottles on the coffee table below. He couldn't imagine how they managed it. However, judging by the furniture, the family seemed well-off. The layout was three bedrooms and two living rooms.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then slowly said, \"800.\"\n\nThe man picked at his ear and nodded slightly, then said, \"Alright, but you only have three hours. The two south-facing bedrooms don't need to be cleaned. Everything else needs to be restored to its original state. If my inspection is not satisfactory, I won't pay.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded lightly. The young man then walked towards a smaller bedroom on the south side.\n\nShen Lingdong handed Yuan Yuan a recording device and said, \"To prevent unnecessary trouble, wear this.\" Yuan Yuan nodded and clipped the recording device to her chest. After looking around, she said to Shen Lingdong, \"I'll start by tidying up the sofa. You can handle those dirty areas.\"\n\nAs she spoke, she walked towards the sofa and lifted a blanket on it. Yuan Yuan suddenly let out a scream, \"Why is there someone here?\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly went to check. Yuan Yuan had only lifted a corner of the blanket, revealing a man's two feet.\n\n\"He's probably drunk and fell asleep.\"\n\nAt this moment, the young man came out of the bedroom and stood at the doorway, looking displeased at Shen Lingdong and Yuan Yuan. \"What are you yelling about? I was just about to sleep.\"\n\n\"Sorry, you have a friend who fell asleep on the sofa,\" Shen Lingdong quickly explained.\n\n\"A friend?\" The young man frowned, walked to the sofa, and then pulled off the blanket.\n\n\"Holy crap!\" The man exclaimed in surprise.\n\nShen Lingdong and Yuan Yuan, who were about to leave, turned back to look after hearing the man's exclamation. They saw a man lying on the sofa, with a trace of red bloodstain on the back of his neck. The man was about 1.8 meters tall and slightly overweight.\n\nShen Lingdong put on his gloves, gently touched the neck, and then looked at Yuan Yuan. \"He's dead. Call the police.\"\n\nYuan Yuan quickly took out her phone and dialed the emergency number. The young man stared wide-eyed at the man in front of him, a look of terror on his face.\n\nShen Lingdong then said to the young man, \"From now on, don't move anything in the scene to avoid damaging it. Also, who is the deceased to you?\"\n\nThe young man swallowed and carefully looked at the body lying on the sofa, then slowly said, \"Last night I invited some close buddies and their girlfriends to celebrate New Year's. This person… I don't think I know him…\"\n\n\"You don't know him? Then how did he end up in your house?\" Shen Lingdong was slightly surprised.\n\nThe young man looked bewildered, with a hint of a sob in his voice, \"I don't know either. We had a great time last night and drank a lot. I can't remember anything.\"\n\n***\n\n*Author's Note:* I apologize to everyone. I'm sorry for deceiving you for so long. It's tiring pretending to be an adult. To keep you from finding out, I had to pretend to be working every day, but I'm actually only 10 years old. I've decided to reveal this now because I know I was wrong. I hope that, considering I'm a child, you'll send me a red envelope on June 1st, Children's Day. Thank you, my lovely brothers and sisters.",

    "content": "While waiting for the police to arrive, Shen Lingdong intended to first understand the basic situation from the young man.\n\nTo his surprise, he was met with the young man's refusal. Initially confused, he had answered some of Shen Lingdong's questions, but now that he had collected himself, he realized that the young man in front of him was just a cleaner. \"You're a cleaner, why should I answer your questions? I'm the one who does the reasoning and solves cases. We should protect the scene now. Please step outside the room and wait.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the young man pushed them out of the room and stood at the doorway himself, preventing Shen Lingdong and Yuan Yuan from entering. He then picked up his phone and started calling friends, complaining about the bad luck of having a dead person in his room.\n\nA moment later, Lin Xiangbei arrived at the scene with his team. Upon seeing Shen Lingdong, Lin Xiangbei immediately asked, \"How's the situation?\"\n\nThe young man thought Lin Xiangbei was speaking to him and quickly replied, \"Officer, I've secured the scene. These two are cleaners I hired.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Lin Xiangbei responded softly, then said to Shen Lingdong, \"Come in and take a look with me.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded quickly.\n\nThe young man was called out of the room and questioned by two police officers, while Shen Lingdong and Lin Xiangbei walked into the room.\n\nAs they walked, Shen Lingdong said, \"The victim has a wound on the back of his head, but I don't know if it's fatal. The homeowner and the victim don't know each other.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned slightly and said, \"After all this time, you've only gathered this much information.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"What can I find out as a cleaner?\"\n\nWhen they entered the room, Lin Xiangbei couldn't help but exclaim, \"Holy cow... This...\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"We were doing regular cleaning, but when Yuan Yuan was preparing to clean the sofa, she found someone underneath, and then discovered he was already dead.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at Yuan Yuan by the door and then asked Shen Lingdong, \"Isn't she supposed to be off today?\"\n\n\"She came to the company because she was bored, and I roped her into working overtime.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated for a moment, then said, \"It's not that we suspect her, but she is a bit suspicious. When we were checking Zhou Xinghuai's bank account, we found several transfer records between him and Yuan Yuan.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said, \"I also asked her for some scripts she had written before, but since she showed them to me, I probably can't tell anything from them. Also, there were emails found in Zhao Xiaofei's room that were sent from my company's IP address. I don't think they were faked. I've tested this many times, but perhaps because Zhou Xinghuai was her former boss, even if there are doubts, it's understandable.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and then reminded him, \"It's better to be careful.\"\n\nThe two then began to examine the body. Both noticed that the blood had soaked into the sofa in front of the victim. Due to the super absorbent capacity of the sponge, the blood only remained on the sofa and did not drip down, otherwise, it would not have been discovered until now.\n\nAt this time, Sister Xi Liang also arrived at the scene and conducted a preliminary examination of the body. The final result was that the time of death was between 11:45 PM yesterday and 0:15 AM today. The cause of death was a glass shard piercing the chest, leading to excessive blood loss. The wound on the back of the head was formed before the fatal wound to the chest, suggesting the victim might have been knocked unconscious, brought here, and then murdered.\n\nAfter Sister Xi's autopsy was completed, the police officer in charge of questioning the young man also approached Lin Xiangbei and reported the situation.\n\nThe homeowner's name was Song Yu.\n\nLast night, he had invited three friends, Lin Xiang and Wang Xin. They each brought their girlfriends, and Wang Xin's girlfriend also brought her best friend, planning to introduce her best friend Li Jiachun to Song Yu as a girlfriend.\n\nThey had a great time, and the noise was loud. During this time, a downstairs resident came up to ask them to keep it down. Since they had all been drinking, there was some conflict with the downstairs resident. The downstairs resident was then dragged into the room by several of them, and that person accidentally stepped on a wine bottle and fell onto the sofa. This happened at ten o'clock last night.\n\nLater, they continued drinking. Someone suggested watching the New Year's Eve gala, as it was close to midnight and they could catch the countdown. They weren't in the mood for the performances. After the countdown, they played some games for a while, finished the remaining alcohol, and then went home. It seemed they had broken a wine bottle during this time.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned and looked at Shen Lingdong, saying doubtfully, \"After the countdown at midnight, they played some games before leaving, which means the killer had no time to bring the victim here and commit the murder. So why was the victim here? What do you think, Consultant Shen?\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, then went outside and waved to Song Yu, calling him over. \"Now that I'm asking you questions, can you tell me?\"\n\nSong Yu quickly nodded and said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know you were a criminal investigation consultant just now. What questions do you have for me?\"\n\n\"What was the program after the countdown ended last night?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"I don't know. No one cared about that. After the countdown ended, we started celebrating, and then someone pulled us into playing games.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, then asked, \"Did those girls also drink a lot of alcohol?\"\n\nSong Yu thought for a moment and replied, \"Not too much, only three or four bottles. However, their alcohol tolerance isn't very high, and they got drunk very early.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei also arrived at the door and instructed a police officer, \"Go to property management and check the surveillance.\"\n\nThe two then returned to the room to continue searching for other clues.\n\nThere was still an important point: the victim's identity had not yet been confirmed. However, after investigating the residential area, no one was reported missing, so it could be temporarily ruled out that the victim was a resident of the area.\n\nHowever, the victim's identity information was soon found. Through fingerprint comparison, it was discovered that the victim was Zhou Kai, twenty-seven years old, Li Jiachun's ex-boyfriend. They had broken up two months ago, but Zhou Kai had been pestering Li Jiachun. According to the testimonies of the others, Song Yu had previously said during drinking that if Li Jiachun's ex-boyfriend was bothering her, she could call him.\n\nSong Yu also admitted to this.\n\nFurthermore, the surveillance video captured Zhou Kai appearing at the entrance of the residential area, following a resident inside, and never leaving.\n\nThe surveillance video also showed Lin Xiang and Wang Xin leaving the residential area with their respective girlfriends, but Li Jiachun's departure was not recorded. The time was 12:18 AM.\n\nAfter learning of this evidence, Lin Xiangbei brought them back to the police station. The murderer must be among them.\n\nSong Yu was considered to be the most suspicious.",

Lin Xiangbei passed the contrast and matched the glass fragments in the room.\n\nShen Lingdong found most of the glass fragments, and finally he could almost restore a complete wine bottle. It was explained that Zhou Kai was hit by a bottle in this room.\n\nBut there is a point, according to the time when Lin Xiang, Wang Kai and others left, the deceased were on the scene when they were hit.\n\nSo, there is a possibility\n\nThey made several personal confessions\n\nSo you need to take it back and all of them will be reviewed\n\nBack at the police, Lin Xiangbei immediately interrogated several people, and Shen Lingdong was waiting in the lounge.\n\nIt took no time for the recorder on his chest to suddenly sound \"Didi\" reminding Shen Lingdong that his memory was full\n\nOnly then did Shen Lingdong remember that his recorder had not been closed. Shen Lingdong hurriedly took off the record, unplugged the memory card, hesitated for a moment, then walked towards the technology department, found Song Hai, received a computer and card reader, and then began to view the content he recorded, worrying about whether he had missed any important traces.\n\nAfter watching it one by one, Shen Lingdong did not find any abnormalities.\n\nHowever, Shen Lingdong looked at the video and fell into deep thought\n\nAfter a while, Shen Lingdong suddenly stood up and walked towards the consultation room.\n\nWhen I arrived at the door of the interview room, I saw Lin Xiangbei being questioned Song Yu, but he didn't disturb him, so I stood at the door and waited. Before long, Bureau Sun opened the door from the next monitoring room and asked Shen Lingdong: \"Are you asking Lin Xiangbei for something?\"\n\nShen Lingdong ordered a little\n\n\"Come in, we're having a call, Lin Xiangbei can hear it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly stunned. He didn't expect that his identity could actually walk into the monitoring room, even though he strode in.\n\nBefore coming to the phone, Shen Lingdong sighed lightly, and then said to the phone: \"Lin Team, I am Shen Lingdong, my hand is Li Jiaji. The process of the process is like this. She knew that the deceased Zhou Kai would definitely follow her to Yuannan District. It can be seen that this is not the first time Zhou Kai has done this. In the process of seeking complexity. In the middle, any boy who has walked close to Li Jia Pu Jing will become the goal. On the table, Song Yu also revealed the idea of giving Li Jia Pu Jing a headline. Li Jia Pu Jing doesn’t need to do anything. Just drink less wine and control the process. The process is also very simple. Just remind everyone to watch the New Year’s Eve Count.\n\n\"After that, after a few games, it didn't take too long, because everyone had drunk alcohol at that time, and no one would pay attention to the time, but this was a day. When the police conducted an investigation, it was difficult to estimate the time period. It was impossible to calculate how long the game was done. At this time, the time was already twelve o'clock, and the game seemed to have not been done for how long it was.\"\n\n\"But the rings at this time were not well controlled. One of the boys drank too much and accidentally vomited on the hanging lamp in the living room. Of course, the person standing opposite him was in trouble. One of them was vomited and needed to go to the hygiene room to clean up.Another time, when they had drunk too much, their two girlfriends went to take care of their boyfriends, and the party ended here to end the boy who drank too much and left the room and came downstairs to get breathy, waiting for the person who was vomited all over.\"\n\n\"At this time, Zhou Kai, who was hiding in the building, saw that the person had left. While the door was not closed, he walked into the room and warned Song Yu to Song Yu as long as he was a victim, Song Yu, who was on the head of alcohol, would urge him and pick up the bottle and smash it at Zhou Kai. Even if Zhou Kai didn't do it, Li Jia Qing would do it himself.\"\n\n\"And the person who cleaned up in the sanitation room did not hear the sound of the wine bottles breaking outside because of the sound of Shuilong. Even if they came out of the sanitation room and accidentally saw the glass fragments on the ground, they would not care about it because they had broken a bottle before.\"\n\n\"After being knocked down, Zhou Kai fell on the sand, and at this time the people in the sanitation came out. Li Jiaqing hurriedly put the blanket on Zhou Kai and told the other two that she would not go back tonight. When the other two left, Li Jiaqing had to take advantage of Song Yu's inattention to put a piece of glass into the dead, and use his own gravity to insert the fragments into his chest, so that the dead could complete the operation without hesitation. Even if the police conducted an investigation, it was because the deceased fell on the sand and accidentally pressed the glass fragments, causing death.\"\n\n\"As for Song Yu, because Li Jia said nothing about not going home, he would forget his mistakes, especially when he was drunk, and even when he woke up the next day, he forgot to beat him because he drank a snippet.\"\n\n\"In this case, the main thing is the time of time displayed on the monitored video. They don't seem to have enough time to do this. After the New Year's Eve, I was repeatedly watching the videos, and I discovered an important point. The videos I took can be played repeatedly, so the New Year's Eve party can also be played repeatedly, even last year's New Year's Eve party.\"\n\n\"Put forward the need to watch the New Year's Eve countdown and insert the prepared U disk into the TV. They thought they had watched the New Year's Eve countdown, but the real time was not 12 o'clock. It was this time difference that gave Li Jia a pure space to operate.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei heard the sound from the headphones, and then stood up and left Song Yu's interview room.\n\nAt this time, Shen Lingdong raised his head and looked at the Sun Bureau, saying, \"The U disk may have been destroyed, but in the computer in Li Jiaqing's home, the download record should still be saved and it is not available for deletion.\"\n\nThe Sun Bureau heard the news and hurriedly sent someone to Li Jiazhuo's house for investigation.\n\nSure enough\n\nThe police found the download record of last year's New Year's Eve party on Li Jiaqing's computer. Li Jiaqing looked at the evidence taken out by Lin Xiangbei and had to confess all of them.\n\nThe situation is basically the same as Shen Lingdong's analysis\n\nHowever, she did not regret what she did because he thought Zhou Kai was dead\n\nThey broke up for more than a month, but Zhou Kai kept plaguing her, and he also had pure indecent photos of Li Jia. If they were not combined, Zhou Kai would have published those indecent photos.Li Jiadi was forced to go to the point of desperate situation, so she was shocked to kill her.\n\nAfter Li Jiaqing signed the confession, Shen Lingdong was not happy. He now discovered a terrible fact. Most of the killings were caused by the police. The police easily locked the suspect through monitoring and visiting.\n\nBut now, even for ordinary murders, the killer predicted it and used some tricks to derail the suspicion\n\nJudging from the various manifestations in the case, Li Jia-Ding is not a director, but his method of committing crimes is undoubtedly similar to high IQ crimes. This phenomenon is likely to be affected by the director's recent high IQ crimes.\n\nAlthough the police have done a good job in keeping confidentiality, the Internet has been too far from being developed. Once the case is exposed online, netizens will each become Sherlock Holmes and will participate in the case. Faced with the crowd of netizens, the case will gradually become clearer. The Internet is a double-blade sword, which will bring good influence and negative influence. It is difficult to guarantee that some people will learn some negative things from the middle.\n\nThe case in Yuannan District has been solved, so there is no need to continue to block the scene. Shen Lingdong can go directly to the scene to clean it up.\n\nAlthough Song Yu also participated in the murder case, and he was used to the general, the murder case had nothing to do with him and he had to be pursued. He could only say that he was fighting and even though he could leave, he was still in the face of being sued by the deceased's family.\n\nSong Yu was sent back to Yuannan District by the police. When he was under the floor, Shen Lingdong gave Song Yu a protective suit. Now it is the scene of a murder case, so you must be extra careful when entering and leaving.\n\nSong Yu looked up at the building and said, \"Oh, this happened, and that room can't be lived in.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately said, \"Are you afraid of this?\"\n\nSong Yu turned over and asked Shen Lingdong, \"Aren't you afraid?\"\n\nShen Lingdong slightly slammed his head\n\nAt this time, Song Yu asked Shen Lingdong in confusion: \"Your consultant from a criminal police force, how can you start a safe life?\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately said, \"Have you heard of a special site cleaning group, specializing in cleaning up homicide cases. After I cleaned it up, if you are not afraid of this, you can still live here. Of course, I can also arrange special people to do something special for you, because my current identity cannot promote feudal superstition and it is not convenient to name a name. If there is a requirement, we can stay in your room for one night.\"\n\nSong Yu looked a little hesitant, and after a moment, he asked in confusion: \"Are you a charity organization? Eight hundred pieces of money do so many things.\"\n\nShen Lingdong slightly shook his head, \"Eight hundred blocks are the price of ordinary insurance. Now that there is a murder case, it is another price.\"\n\nSong Yu looked puzzled and continued to ask, \"There is really nothing.\"\n\nShen Lingdong pointed at the head and said, \"It's all about human hearts.\"\n\nSong Yu snatched his eyebrows, slapped for a long time, and said slowly, \"I want to try it.\"\"\n\nShen Lingdong clicked the head, and then sent a message to Zheng Daoguang, informing him of the address, and then said to Song Yu, \"I want to enter the venue to clean up now because it is your room and it has been unblocked. I have no right to interfere. You can choose to wait outside or wait in the room.\"\n\nSong Yu hesitated for a moment and then said, \"If I help, can I make a little less money?\"\n\nShen Lingdong snatched his head slightly and said, \"The price was not set by me, but by the Good News. It will take several months for me to get this money.\"\n\n\"Okay, can I watch from the side?\" Song Yu asked\n\nShen Lingdong clicked the head and then took out various tools from the car. On the way to come, he had returned to the company and changed a car, bringing all the tools to clean up the scene of murder cases.\n\nHowever, this time Yuan Yuan did not follow him, only Shen Lingdong was the only one\n\n\"I'll help you.\" Song Yu immediately helped Shen Lingdong bring the tools to the building. Shen Lingdong cleaned up the side and chatted with Song Yu.\n\nSeeing Shen Lingdong clearing the scene bit by bit, Song Yu couldn't help but feel aroused and said, \"It's not easy to be your business. I can't stand this situation.\"\n\n\"Thank you for understanding\"\n\n\"By the way, can I take a video record? It will be a promotion for you,\" Song Yu asked while trying\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and then said, \"The idea of unblocking is that the exercise of the rights of the room has been exchanged for you. As long as you don't smash the load-bearing wall and do not endanger the lives and safety of other people, you can do anything. Although I was designated by the police to clean up the organization, it was actually a personal organization and had no right to commit your personal behavior.\"\n\n\"Hehe, then I'll take a photo. I guarantee that this video will be very popular.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Song Yu and immediately asked, \"What kind of work are you doing?\"\n\n\"Media, that is, short video operation\"\n\n\"Oh\" Shen Lingdong responded lightly and continued to work\n\nHalfway through the cleaning, Zheng Daoguang rushed to the scene. After learning about the situation, he arranged a ritual at the scene, and then began to join the cleaning team with Shen Lingdong.\n\nI know that the cleaning work is over at 8 o'clock in the evening\n\nHowever, Shen Lingdong promised that Song Yu would stay in the room for one night and did not leave.\n\nSong Yu suddenly had a sudden idea at this time, took out his phone and started the live broadcast. Then he chatted with netizens on the phone. After seeing that the popularity of the live broadcast reached a certain level, Song Yu suddenly put away the smile on his face and said, \"Everyone thinks that I am preparing to start cutting fans and leeks when I start live broadcast. Actually, I met a person today. His career is a very common job in our daily life, but the work he does is something we rarely contact.\"\n\n\"This job is called a special live cleaner, which is what we call a safeguard, but the real murder case they cleaned was not in conflict with each other. A murder case occurred in my house, and the murder case has been solved, so don't worry... This guy, he is a special live cleaner and a criminal police officer. Today, it was officially solved by his help.So, the purpose of my live broadcast today is to enter the hearts of two special scene cleaners and listen to their most realistic thoughts…”\n\nLater, Song Yu matched Shen Lingdong with his mobile phone\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and said, \"I took pictures of me without my consent, which violated my portrait rights. However, there is nothing to say. I am just a protective one.\"\n\n\"No, you are not a security insurance. Cleaning the room is just your job, but what you really do is cleaning the crime.\"\n\nShen Lingdong slammed his head slightly and then said, \"That's what the police should do. No matter when and where, we should all trust the people's police. All I did was clean the room so that the next person living here would not have the worries of the future. In addition, I hope that the deceased could leave without any worries.\"\n\nAt this time, Zheng Daoguang interjected from the side, \"I have the most right to speak for this matter. At first, my identity was the family of the deceased. Shen Lingdong took me into this line. Not only did he clean up the room, but he was also the haze on the hearts of the deceased's home. However, in our industry, we have suffered a lot of controversy. Many people are very taboo about our careers. It was a life of the dead. So I hope everyone can let go of their grudges and not look at us with tiny eyes.\"\n\nSong Yu added at this time: \"I have to admit that there is a mistake. At the beginning, my attitude towards them was not very good at the beginning. However, I chatted with Shen Lingdong for an afternoon and felt that this job was a noble job. They were doing the most dirty job, but their hearts were the cleanest. In addition, I heard that our Shen Guard is still single, and the single women in front of the screen should seize the opportunity.\"",

    "content": ", Special Site Cleaner\n\nAt this time, Shen Lingdong's live stream was harmonious, full of respect for his profession.\n\nHowever, this was online. If it were in reality, despite the respect, how many people would be willing to get close to him?\n\nAfter the live stream ended, Song Yu and Zheng Daoguang chatted with Shen Lingdong for a few minutes before dozing off on the table.\n\nShen Lingdong sat on a chair, staring at the spot where the sofa used to be. Although the room was cleaned, the sofa couldn't stay. That space was left empty.\n\nIt wasn't until past three in the morning that Song Yu got up because he was thirsty. Seeing Shen Lingdong still lost in thought, he asked, \"Brother Dong, still not asleep?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and then said, \"Yeah, I can't sleep.\"\n\nSong Yu took two cans of cola from the refrigerator, handed one to Shen Lingdong, and then slowly asked, \"I just had a dream. I dreamt you became a star in the special cleaning industry, with many female fans, and I was your manager.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled.\n\nSong Yu then asked, \"Do you guys have a short video account?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"We had one before, but we didn't use it much.\"\n\nSong Yu hesitated for a moment and then said, \"Sign with my company. I'll help you manage it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and then nodded, saying, \"Okay, but I need to ask Captain Lin. There might be some review or something. I actually have a small idea.\"\n\n\"Sure, no problem. Tell me your idea, and I'll help you write the script.\"\n\n\"It's roughly that you're the director of my video shoots, but you're nowhere to be seen during filming. Then I have to find your videos as the director. That's the general framework.\"\n\nSong Yu hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, \"Okay, no problem. Once we sign, I'll have someone help you write the script.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said to Song Yu, \"Go get some rest.\"\n\nSong Yu looked around and said, \"I just fell asleep accidentally. Now that I have to sleep in this room, I'm a bit uneasy, especially this spot.\"\n\nSong Yu pointed to the place where the sofa used to be.\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and said, \"It's all psychological. If there were really such things, who would still be a doctor or forensic scientist? They're afraid of ghosts too. But the so-called ghosts in their mouths are the various diseases and infections carried by corpses. But you don't need to worry about that, I've cleaned it up for you. If you're still scared...\"\n\nHe patted the sleeping Zheng Daoguang.\n\n\"Huh? What is it?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then pointed to Zheng Daoguang's toolbox and said, \"Get him some magical artifacts.\"\n\n\"Coming right up.\" Zheng Daoguang quickly responded, then looked up at Song Yu and said, \"Although I'm his employee, this is my side hustle, so I still need to charge extra...\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Song Yu nodded.\n\n...\n\nThe next day, early in the morning.\n\nShen Lingdong returned to the company, while Zheng Daoguang went home.\n\nThe company was still quiet today. After locking the main door, Shen Lingdong caught up on sleep in his office. Around noon, he was woken up by a phone call.\n\nThe call was from the Happy Nursing Home. Shen Lingdong looked at his phone, hesitated for a moment, and then slowly answered. The caller was a woman.\n\nThe woman said to Shen Lingdong, \"Happy New Year, Mr. Shen. Why haven't you visited the elderly at the nursing home recently?\"\n\n\"Happy New Year. I've been a bit busy lately.\"\n\n\"Mr. Shen, do you have time to visit the nursing home again? This time, the Dongjiang City Television Station will be filming. If they can film your company volunteering at the nursing home, it would greatly improve the company's reputation.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and then slowly said, \"Personally, I don't have a problem, but I probably can't clean so many rooms by myself.\"\n\n\"Doesn't Mr. Shen have a team?\"\n\n\"Oh, this isn't a volunteer activity. Whether others can participate is voluntary. Although I'm the boss, I can't force my employees. Don't you think so? If you want to gather volunteers for cleaning services, I'll be the first to sign up. I can also provide the equipment, but you'll have to provide the cleaning supplies yourself. If you want my entire team to perform cleaning services, then you'll need to pay for the cleaning.\"\n\nShen Lingdong felt that they were already treating him as free labor. The nursing home knew that to this day, there was no explanation for the missing elderly, and the troublemaking families had gradually quieted down. Some had even withdrawn their cases from the police station, and the matter was dropped.\n\nShen Lingdong was willing to dedicate his compassion to those people, but this would only benefit the owner of the welfare home. More importantly, the owner of the nursing home was currently under Shen Lingdong's suspicion.\n\nThe woman on the other end hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Alright then, Mr. Shen. I won't bother you any longer. You can go ahead and focus on your work.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Shen Lingdong replied softly and hung up the phone.\n\nAfterward, he lay back on the sofa, planning to get some more sleep. However, being disturbed by the woman, his sleepiness was gone. After a moment of thought, he opened his computer and searched for information about the Happy Nursing Home online.\n\nIt turned out they were making big moves.\n\nThe land in Chengdong Community had been acquired by the owner of the Happy Nursing Home, who planned to build the largest public-welfare nursing home in Dongjiang City and even the entire province. The original residents of the community would receive compensation and also be able to stay at the nursing home for free.\n\nAlthough it was a good thing, Shen Lingdong couldn't figure out the owner's true intentions.\n\nAfter a slight hesitation, Shen Lingdong got up and walked outside. He got into his car and drove towards Chengdong Community.\n\nBecause it was winter, there were fewer people outside, and it was hard to see young people. Shen Lingdong sat in the car and waited at the entrance for a while before seeing an elderly person returning from grocery shopping. Shen Lingdong quickly got out of the car and chased after him.\n\nCoincidentally, this elder also had some connection with Shen Lingdong. During the investigation of the Chengdong Community case, he had provided Shen Lingdong with a lot of information at the entrance.\n\n\"Grandpa, let me help you carry that.\"\n\nWhen the elder saw Shen Lingdong, he frowned slightly and recalled, \"Oh, it's you.\"\n\n\"I was just passing by and came to take a look. Grandpa, are you going grocery shopping?\" Shen Lingdong took the bag from the elder's hand. Seeing that the contents were quite heavy, he added, \"Buying so many eggs?\"\n\n\"They're free.\" The elder had a smug smile on his face.\n\n\"Where did you get them for free?\" Shen Lingdong glanced at the elder's finger, on which there was still some red ink that hadn't been cleaned off.\n\n\"We're about to be relocated again, and the subsidies for us elderly are better. Some people have already claimed benefits for their elderly family members. So the developer asked us elderly to register in person, bring our ID cards, take some photos, and press our fingerprints. They also prepared some eggs. Every elderly person who registers in person can get ten pounds of eggs.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and then asked, \"Where is that place?\"\n\n\"Just up ahead, around the corner.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Shen Lingdong nodded lightly and continued to follow the elder.\n\nAfter escorting the elder home, Shen Lingdong left and went to the location indicated by the elder.\n\nIn front of a shop, many elderly people were queuing.\n\nThere were dedicated personnel at the entrance to verify the information of the elderly entering the building. Shen Lingdong didn't know the situation inside, but the elderly who came out would wipe their fingers, all ten of them, meaning all their fingerprints had been collected.\n\nShen Lingdong suddenly remembered that Lin Xiangbei had mentioned a criminal gang that collected personal information. Could this be related to that gang?\n\nAfter a slight hesitation, Shen Lingdong reported the matter to Lin Xiangbei. After all, with such interaction, collecting evidence would be very simple. But if these were all small fries, and because of him, their long-planned scheme was ruined.\n\nAs soon as he sent the information to Lin Xiangbei, Lin Xiangbei's call came through.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly asked, \"How are things arranged by the Shengjing City police?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that for now. Come to Heyan Community immediately. There's been a homicide here.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm on my way.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly returned to his car and drove towards Lanhe Community.\n\nThe community was only a little more than ten minutes away from Chengdong Community. When Shen Lingdong arrived, the police had already sealed off the scene. The body was found in the underground parking garage.\n\nUnder the guidance of the police, Shen Lingdong arrived at the underground parking garage.\n\nThe body was inside a charred car. The car windows were shattered but still attached to the window frames, and the outside was also scorched black.\n\nThe car door was locked from the inside.\n\nThere was a severely charred body inside, but the car's interior was completely undamaged.\n\nWhen Lin Xiangbei saw Shen Lingdong arrive, he asked a police officer to brief Shen Lingdong on the situation. This parking space belonged to the informant. When he drove in, he found his parking space occupied. He was still alive, but when he got closer, he discovered that the car had been burned and saw someone inside, so he reported it.\n\nAt this time, several police officers were carefully cleaning the glass adhering to the car window, preparing to open the car door and carry the body out. Shen Lingdong looked inside through the gaps in the shattered car window and then frowned.\n\n\"This is definitely not the primary crime scene. Someone burned the deceased and then transported the body here, burning it along with the car.\"\n\nShen Lingdong put on gloves and lightly touched the car's engine hood. It was still warm. He then looked up and said, \"There's a fire alarm here. If the car caught fire, why didn't it trigger the fire alarm?\"\n\n\"It indeed didn't. And the surveillance camera that could capture this car also happened to be broken.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked around and then found a yellowish crystal under the car. His expression immediately became serious. He then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Is this burnt salt?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei took the burnt crystal, examined it, and handed it to a nearby police officer, instructing, \"Go and check what this is immediately!\"\n\nShen Lingdong asked Lin Xiangbei, \"If this is salt, then this case is related to the director.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and continued, \"This garage only has one entrance and exit. We've reviewed the surveillance footage at the entrance and haven't found any suspicious vehicles. The owner of this car is a resident of this community, and we've contacted him. He's on his way.\"\n\n\"What does he do?\" Shen Lingdong immediately asked.\n\n\"A middle manager at an internet company.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued to ask, \"It's a holiday today. Where did he go?\"\n\n\"Shopping with his wife.\"\n\n\"Then didn't he drive?\" Shen Lingdong asked back doubtfully.\n\nLin Xiangbei showed a hint of helplessness on his face and said, \"I'm also very curious. However, after contacting him, his reaction was surprised, and he didn't know about this. I also asked him why he didn't drive. His explanation was that his hand was injured and he couldn't drive, and it was a burn.\"\n\nShen Lingdong showed a hint of surprise and then said, \"It could also be a burn.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Shen Lingdong asked, \"When will Sister Xi arrive? Let's do an autopsy first.\"\n\n\"She should be here soon.\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, several people walked in from the entrance.\n\n\"Sister Xi is here.\" Lin Xiangbei looked towards the entrance and said.\n\nAt this time, the body was being carried out of the car. The body had begun to swell, and some pus was flowing out of the flesh that had cracked due to the burning.\n\nSister Xi frowned. After a simple examination, she asked people to take the body to the dissection room. Then she said to Lin Xiangbei, \"There are no other wounds on the body, and there's a slight case of giantism. Based on the temperature in this garage, the deceased has likely been dead for about a month.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the car at this moment and then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"This car also needs an autopsy. Check the seats for pus and the penetration depth of the pus. It can also help determine when the deceased was placed in this car.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei then said, \"According to the informant, he drove his car away this morning, and when he returned at noon, he found his parking space occupied.\"\n\nAt this time, a car arrived with a man in front of Lin Xiangbei. \"Captain Lin, the car owner is here.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei pointed to the \"unrecognizable\" car in front of him and said, \"Is this your car?\"\n\nThe man looked at the car, then at the license plate, and nodded. His face showed a confused expression. \"It is my car, but I didn't park my car in this spot. I have my own parking space.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the man took out his car keys from his pocket and pressed them.\n\nSuddenly, the sound of a car unlocking echoed through the garage.\n\nA car not far away flashed its yellow lights. Several people were stunned.\n\nThe man quickly went to check and then shouted to Lin Xiangbei, \"Officer, my car is fine, my car is still here!\"\n\nLin Xiangbei and Shen Lingdong immediately went to check. Seeing the same car model and license plate, the two looked at each other and then frowned.",

    "content": ", Special Scene Cleaner\n\nWith the ¥2,000 deposited, Shen Lingdong returned to the van and began purchasing cleaning supplies and protective gear online.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhao Xiaofei joined the effort to catch stray dogs.\n\nTwo hours later, a disheveled Zhao Xiaofei and the city management officers drove away. Shen Lingdong remained at the scene.\n\nShen Lingdong was not bothered by his plan being disrupted. His method was crude and only an auxiliary investigation. Lin Xiangbei must have better uses for these stray dogs and a faster way to gather clues.\n\nFurthermore, he thought of another method.\n\nSome people might also care about those stray dogs. If the stray dogs on the street suddenly disappeared, someone might inquire about their whereabouts.\n\nTherefore, he decided to stay and observe.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, the sun rose high.\n\nShen Lingdong saw the old man from a few days ago emerge again, sitting at the entrance of the residential compound, fanning himself to pass the time.\n\nThe old man looked around, seeming to feel that something was missing. He then asked the old man next to him about the stray dogs' whereabouts. Upon learning that the stray dogs had been captured by the city management, he leaned against a tree trunk and closed his eyes to rest.\n\nShen Lingdong got out of the van and approached the old man, squatting down beside him.\n\nThe old man seemed to sense someone nearby and squinted at Shen Lingdong. Seeing Shen Lingdong, he found him somewhat familiar but couldn't recall where they had met. After some thought, he remembered.\n\n\"Oh, it's you! After I listened to you last time, I called the community again and asked them to deal with the stray dog problem. I didn't expect them to be so efficient this time. Look, there are no stray dogs now.\" The old man said with a smile, boasting about his contribution.\n\nShen Lingdong didn't expose him and nodded in agreement, saying, \"The community's efficiency is indeed high.\"\n\nThe old man suddenly became serious and asked Shen Lingdong, \"What happens to those dogs after they're caught?\"\n\n\"They're sent to a shelter to await adoption. However, most adopters prefer puppies or purebred dogs. The policy has changed. They didn't allow visits before, but now there are fixed visiting times each month where people can observe the stray dogs' living conditions,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"That's good. If they were killed after being caught, I would have become a sinner. This is much better; those dogs won't suffer, and we old folks don't have to worry about any accidents.\" The old man breathed a sigh of relief, saying thankfully.\n\nShen Lingdong continued to agree with the old man, \"Finally, they won't have to starve anymore.\"\n\nThe old man smacked his lips and sighed, \"It's not necessarily starving.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately retorted, \"Or even getting beaten?\"\n\nThe old man turned his head to look at the residential compound behind him and said:\n\n\"There's a man in our compound, about forty years old. A young woman was walking her dog, and her dog wasn't very well-behaved. It was a small, curly-haired one that always liked to hug people's legs. One day, that dog jumped at the man's leg, and the young woman told the man, 'Give it a kick,' and ran away. The man directly kicked the dog to death.\"\n\n\"The young woman was also a bit upset. She insisted the man compensate her and even called the police. Later, the man became quite annoyed with dogs. Every time he saw them, he would scare them, sometimes hitting them with a stick. Now, all the dog owners in the compound avoid him.\"\n\nShen Lingdong pondered for a moment, then asked, \"Where does that man live?\"\n\nThe old man thought for a moment and said, \"I really don't know. I haven't seen him for a long time.\"\n\n\"When was the dog kicked to death?\"\n\n\"A few years ago, I don't remember.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then sent a WeChat message to Zhao Xiaofei: \"Check for a case a few years ago in Chengdong Residential Compound where someone kicked a dog to death. The police came at the time; do you have any records?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThis time, Zhao Xiaofei replied quickly.\n\nLess than half an hour later, Lin Xiangbei and Zhao Xiaofei arrived at Chengdong Residential Compound.\n\nLin Xiangbei saw Shen Lingdong squatting at the entrance of the compound and glanced at the old man beside him. He didn't stop or greet them, but directly led his team into the compound.\n\nAfter they entered the compound, Shen Lingdong received a WeChat message from Zhao Xiaofei: \"The boss said for you to continue your undercover work in this compound, so he didn't greet you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong put away his phone and continued chatting with the old man, primarily trying to discreetly gather information about the \"young woman\" from him.\n\nIf the man who kicked the dog to death was the deceased, he speculated that the killer might have had a conflict with the deceased over pets like cats and dogs. This would identify a new group of suspects, clarifying the direction of the investigation.\n\nBecause he didn't know what the delivery station owner had confessed, if the police had enough clues, the killer might already be obvious.\n\nHowever, there was still one lingering mystery.\n\nCao Xinde's situation constantly swirled in Shen Lingdong's mind; he still couldn't figure out Cao Xinde's situation.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong stood up, stretching his numb legs, and collected his thoughts as he looked into the compound.\n\nAfter waiting for about half an hour, Lin Xiangbei and his team emerged from the compound, their expressions much more relaxed than before they entered. After they left, Shen Lingdong took out his phone and sent Lin Xiangbei a WeChat message.\n\n\"I thought you weren't going to tell me the victim's identity, but it turns out you didn't because you hadn't confirmed it yet.\"\n\nA moment later, Lin Xiangbei replied: \"No one was home. I've collected hair and skin cells from the room for DNA comparison. Waiting for the results.\"\n\nShen Lingdong replied with a smiling emoji.\n\nA while later, Lin Xiangbei transferred ¥2,000 to Shen Lingdong and replied: \"I heard from Xiaofei that you borrowed money from him. This ¥2,000 is a personal reward from me, thank you for the clues you provided this time.\"\n\n\"What about my ¥50,000?\"\n\n\"It's been approved by the higher-ups. It should be going through the procedures.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter returning to the criminal investigation team, Lin Xiangbei questioned Bao Wenyu again. However, he didn't get any new leads and released him.\n\nWhen Bao Wenyu came out of the criminal investigation team, he was startled to see several dog cages placed in the team's courtyard.\n\nLin Xiangbei stood by the window, observing the dogs' reactions.\n\nMost of the dogs showed fear towards Bao Wenyu. Upon seeing him, they immediately tucked their tails between their legs. However, one dog showed affection towards Bao Wenyu.",

    "content": "Chapter 127: Arranging a Confidential Informant\n\nShen Lingdong woke up abruptly and looked at Lin Xiangbei.\n\nLin Xiangbei repeated, \"The identity of the deceased has been confirmed. It is Lu Guisen.\"\n\n\"Lu Guisen...\" Shen Lingdong fell into thought, then slowly said, \"What is Wu Yuhao's connection to the Happy Nursing Home? Why would the killer counterfeit one of his cars? And what happened to his car?\"\n\n\"We haven't found any connection between Wu Yuhao and the Happy Nursing Home yet. Although the surveillance camera that could have filmed that car malfunctioned, we discovered a strange phenomenon through other surveillance cameras,\" Liao Jia said, pulling out her phone and showing a video to Lin Xiangbei and Shen Lingdong.\n\nAt 11:03 AM, a green dot suddenly appeared in the rearview mirror of a car, followed by a relatively bright light. The phenomenon lasted for less than a minute.\n\nLiao Jia continued, \"After comparison, the location where the green dot was emitted was the deceased's car.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded slightly, saying, \"If that light was from the car burning, then the duration is too short. So, the car fire was a facade. What is the killer trying to imply by doing this?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and asked Liao Jia, \"Is the scorched white substance found under the car salt?\"\n\nLiao Jia quickly responded, \"No, it's desiccant.\"\n\n\"Desiccant?\" Shen Lingdong was slightly taken aback, then slowly said, \"Could it be that white phosphorus was placed in water, and then the desiccant absorbed the moisture, causing the white phosphorus to self-ignite and burn the car? That doesn't seem right...\"\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately said, \"If white phosphorus is stored, it requires a certain amount of cold water. If desiccant is used to absorb water, it also requires a certain amount of desiccant. Even if it's close to the ignition point, combustion would leave traces and not just such a small particle under the car.\"\n\nShen Lingdong pondered for a moment and ventured, \"Could it have fallen from the killer?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei remained silent, lost in thought for a moment, then said, \"Is there any way to make a car burn for a few minutes?\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately replied, \"The temperature in the garage wasn't high at the time. Even if white phosphorus was exposed to the air, it wouldn't reach its ignition point. The evidence suggests that the green light was likely from burning white phosphorus, so for the white phosphorus to burn, the car must have been running. But I can't figure out the killer's motive for doing this. If they wanted to prove their alibi, destroying just one surveillance camera wouldn't be enough. Although the car only had one entrance and exit, they could still leave through the pedestrian passage, and the surveillance camera there was intact.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei sighed, \"We checked the other surveillance cameras. Because it was a holiday, not many people were entering or exiting the garage, so we didn't find anyone else entering or exiting on the surveillance. It's as if the suspect vanished into thin air after driving the car into the garage.\"\n\nShen Lingdong followed up, \"Not even other vehicles entering or exiting?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei shook his head slightly.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then asked, \"Were there any other personnel in the garage?\"\n\n\"There was a security guard, but he was in a corner on the other side and didn't notice the car catching fire. By the time he returned, the fire in the car had already been extinguished,\" Lin Xiangbei said.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, then said, \"Since he had such a perfect escape method, there was no need to set the car on fire or use delayed white phosphorus auto-ignition to stall for time. So, what was his purpose?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei slowly stated, \"And he even counterfeited Wu Yuhao's car. If he wanted to blend into the garage, he only needed to fake the license plate. But if he wanted to involve Wu Yuhao, he had to counterfeit an identical car to link Wu Yuhao to this case. Could the killer be trying to remind Wu Yuhao of something in this way?\"\n\n\"Also, can we find the primary crime scene?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked troubled, saying, \"That might be a bit difficult. After all, the deceased has been dead for a month, so finding the primary scene is extremely challenging.\"\n\n\"If the killer targeted Wu Yuhao, then Wu Yuhao becomes a starting point.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded in agreement, then made a phone call, instructing his subordinates to keep a close eye on Wu Yuhao and report immediately if anything happened. Additionally, the internal investigation of the Happy Nursing Home needed to be expedited.\n\nAt this point, Shen Lingdong slowly said, \"Should we go to the Happy Nursing Home again?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated for a moment, then slowly said, \"Not for now. You should go back and rest. I'll text you when we find new evidence.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then nodded. He got up and walked towards the outside. After leaving Lin Xiangbei's office, he checked the time. It was past five o'clock. Shen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then headed straight to the lounge. It wouldn't make much difference to wait a little longer, so he decided to wait for Gu Caiwei to finish work.\n\nShen Lingdong requested some photos of the deceased and then stared at them absentmindedly. The deceased had no other injuries, but there was no dust found in his nasal cavity or mouth. This situation is often seen in cases where bodies are cremated after death, but the forensic report clearly stated that the deceased was burned to death. Furthermore, typically, cremation would cause the deceased to exhibit a slightly fetal protective posture, but this was not evident in Lu Guisen. Moreover, the degree of burns on the deceased's body was too uniform. The surface was carbonized, but most of the internal tissues were intact. This situation should be caused by high-temperature flames instantly generated on the body's surface, carbonizing the epidermis... Could it have been done with a flamethrower, carbonizing the entire surface of the deceased bit by bit? If the killer was related to the Happy Nursing Home, it should be the nursing home's kitchen. He seemed to recall seeing one during the last cleanup.\n\nJust then, Gu Caiwei suddenly pushed open the lounge door, looking at Shen Lingdong with a puzzled expression, and asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Waiting for you to finish work,\" Shen Lingdong replied casually.\n\nGu Caiwei seemed surprised by this answer and then asked again, somewhat uncertainly, \"Waiting for me to finish work?\"\n\nShen Lingdong, who had been lost in thought about the case, snapped back to reality and quickly said, \"I have something I want to consult you about.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Gu Caiwei immediately asked.\n\nShen Lingdong lightly scratched his head and then said, \"Let's wait until you finish work.\"\n\nGu Caiwei glanced at the time and smiled, \"Then wait for me a little longer.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly. Not long after, Gu Caiwei pushed open the lounge door again and said to Shen Lingdong, \"Let's go.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then stood up and walked outside. As they walked, Gu Caiwei asked, \"What did you want to ask me?\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately asked, \"Your friend, the psychologist, why haven't I seen him recently? A few days ago, when I planned to visit, I found his psychological clinic closed.\"\n\n\"Lin Suqing? She went to Shengjing City for something,\" Gu Caiwei replied quickly. After a brief pause, she asked again, \"You still haven't gotten over that incident? I thought you were fine now.\"\n\n\"Can you tell if someone has a psychological problem just by looking at them outside? But I'm fine now. I originally wanted to find her and introduce her to Zhao Xiaofei. I think Zhao Xiaofei also needs some psychological counseling.\" Shen Lingdong smiled. He was looking for Lin Suqing because he felt she had some connection to the film crew. Lin Suqing's disappearance coincided with the time when the Zhou Xinghuai lead was completely wiped out. Therefore, Shen Lingdong suspected that Lin Suqing had fled.\n\n\"Then when she returns, I'll call her and ask her to counsel Zhao Xiaofei. Fortunately, he still has a chance to return to the Criminal Police Corps.\"\n\n\"En,\" Shen Lingdong nodded, then got into the car.\n\nAfter getting in the car, Shen Lingdong continued to ask, \"Have you been in contact with Tang Feng recently? I heard he went to the special task force.\"\n\nA hint of confusion appeared on Gu Caiwei's face, and she replied, \"I'm not sure why he went to the special task force. But you've also become a consultant, so you're half a police officer now. It's really not easy for you to reach this point.\"\n\n\"I don't get paid, so I'm working for free. Before, I could earn some extra money from bounties, but now I can't even earn that.\"\n\n\"You say you're short on money, but you don't actually value money. You just want to get closer to Uncle Shen's case. Otherwise, would you do this job without pay?\" Gu Caiwei smiled.\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and said nothing. After that, neither of them spoke until Shen Lingdong dropped Gu Caiwei off at the entrance of her residential complex. Shen Lingdong finally spoke, \"There's one more thing I'd like to ask for your help with.\"\n\n\"What help?\" Gu Caiwei quickly asked.\n\n\"Do you still have Di Fang's WeChat? The girl who stayed at your place for a night?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"Yes, why?\"\n\n\"Can you develop her into your confidential informant?\" Shen Lingdong tried to ask.\n\n\"What do you want to do?\"\n\n\"She's living with Yuan Yuan now. I want to pay attention to Yuan Yuan's every move at home, and what she usually writes,\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\n\"You suspect Yuan Yuan?\" Gu Caiwei asked.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly. \"I don't know if I'm just being overly suspicious, but some things that have happened to Yuan Yuan are coincidental. Like yesterday, she suddenly came to the company and then received a job. If it were just an ordinary job, it would be fine, but then a murder occurred, and she happened to discover the deceased. It might truly be a coincidence, but I always feel something is strange.\"\n\nGu Caiwei's expression turned serious at this point, and she said to Shen Lingdong, \"Then I'll have to sound out Di Fang first. If her relationship with Yuan Yuan is too good, and she tells Yuan Yuan that I want to develop her into a confidential informant, then Yuan Yuan will definitely realize that you asked me to do it. If she's innocent, it will be detrimental to you. If she's guilty, it will expose your intentions.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"Yes, Yuan Yuan must not find out about this.\"\n\n\"En,\" Gu Caiwei replied softly.\n\n...\n\nAfter dropping Gu Caiwei off, Shen Lingdong also returned home. Before going home, he went back to his company to retrieve his diary from his drawer, and then went home. After taking a shower and returning to his room, Shen Lingdong opened the diary, looked at the blank pages, and slowly picked up a pen, writing in the diary:\n\n\"Dad, today is my first day as a criminal investigation consultant, and I'm considered half a police officer. Mom doesn't know about this yet, but I wanted to tell you first. I'm one step closer to your case.\"\n\n\"Today, something suddenly occurred to me. You have always prevented me from getting close to your case. I don't understand your thoughts, but no person or thing can stop my desire to investigate your case.\"\n\nAfter writing these two sentences, Shen Lingdong sat at his desk, lost in thought. Suddenly, Shen Lingdong noticed the list of people who had rented Yu Hai Villa in recent years placed on his desk. Shen Lingdong looked at it a few more times, then looked at the diary next to it. After a moment of contemplation, Shen Lingdong began to compare the dates on the list with the dates in his diary.\n\nJuly 13, 2018, heavy rain...\n\nAugust 21, 2018, heavy rain...\n\nJanuary 14, 2019, snow...\n\nFebruary 13, 2019, snow...\n\nMay 6, 2019, rain...\n\nShen Lingdong suddenly discovered something: every time the villa was rented out, the weather was not good. It snowed in winter and rained in summer, basically it was bad weather. Leaning back in his chair, Shen Lingdong fell into deep thought. After a moment of consideration, Shen Lingdong recalled a sentence that Yuan Yuan had mentioned: writing requires atmosphere, and only with a matching mood can one achieve the desired effect. In the environment of Yu Hai Villa, and under extreme weather conditions, the most easily thought of is a \"snowstorm mountain\" scenario, and a \"snowstorm mountain\" is also a common murder plot in novels. Could it be that those people went to Yu Hai Villa to find inspiration, thus appearing there on snowy or rainy days? If that were the case, then these people might all be related to the film crew, a group specializing in creating murder scripts. And Yuan Yuan also appeared among them. However, the other employees of their script-killing store were also present. Even if their boss, Zhou Xinghuai, was one of the main leaders of the film crew, it's unlikely that all his employees were also part of the film crew. Therefore, among the same group of people staying there, only one or two might have actually belonged to the film crew. After a moment of hesitation, Shen Lingdong sent this speculation, along with the clues he had thought of that afternoon, to Lin Xiangbei. If this were true, it would be terrifying. How many murder scripts had been created over the years? If all of them were exposed, it would have a significant impact on society. For the first time, Shen Lingdong wished his speculation was wrong.",

    "content": "Chapter 128: Probing\n\nThe next day.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong arrived at the company, he found the door unlocked. However, he clearly remembered locking the company's main door when he left.\n\nUpon entering, he found Wang Jizhong and Zheng Daoguang both on the first floor. With one day left in the holiday, he didn't expect them to come in today.\n\nJust as he was about to ask, Yuan Yuan also walked out from inside.\n\n\"Why are you all here?\" Shen Lingdong immediately asked.\n\n\"We heard you've been on cases for two consecutive days. You're still on holiday, and you haven't had a moment's rest. We wanted to see if we could help you with anything?\" Wang Jizhong said to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong then slowly replied, \"This murder case doesn't require the cleanup team for now. You won't be able to access the case, so I'm sorry, but I can't tell you any details about it.\"\n\nWang Jizhong took a sip of tea and then pointed a finger at Shen Lingdong, saying, \"You're acting like those police officers. But I don't want to know the case details. Just tell us what you want us to do.\"\n\nShen Lingdong pouted and then said, \"There seem to be many clues right now, but it's difficult to find strong evidence. If we could find the primary crime scene, the situation might be different, but it's difficult, as it's been a month since the time of death.\"\n\nWang Jizhong then said, \"That's basically very difficult to find. The weather has been variable this month, with several temperature rises and falls. The evidence at the scene has likely already been destroyed.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and then said, \"All the clues the police currently have are concentrated at the Xingfu Retirement Home. Even if the murderer isn't from the retirement home, they are likely closely related to it. So, the focus of the investigation is still on the retirement home.\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded, then turned to Zheng Daoguang, \"Shall we go out for a bit?\"\n\nZheng Daoguang nodded, then said, \"I brought a treasure with me today.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zheng Daoguang mysteriously took a compass out of his bag.\n\nUpon seeing the compass, Shen Lingdong smiled slightly and said, \"I know this, 'Seeking dragons and dividing gold, observing coiled mountains...'\"\n\nAt this moment, Yuan Yuan also came closer and asked, \"Is this thing accurate?\"\n\nZheng Daoguang immediately retorted, \"Is a compass accurate?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Yuan Yuan replied.\n\n\"Then why do you believe in a compass but not a luopan¹?\"\n\nWang Jizhong immediately said, \"Both utilize magnetic fields. Although I affirm Lao Zheng's abilities, I really can't imagine finding the primary crime scene with this thing.\"\n\nZheng Daoguang then snorted coldly and said, \"You can look down on me, but you can't look down on this thing. You all wait, I'll go find it for you now.\"\n\n\"Wait for me,\" Wang Jizhong also stood up and left with Zheng Daoguang.\n\nThe two drove a minivan towards the Xingfu Retirement Home.\n\nNot long after, they stopped less than a hundred meters from the entrance of the Xingfu Retirement Home. Zheng Daoguang stared intently at the luopan, then looked up, surveyed the surroundings, confirmed the direction, and then lowered his head to check the luopan again.\n\nThe two circled the Xingfu Retirement Home several times.\n\nHowever, the luopan in Zheng Daoguang's hand kept fluctuating, making it impossible to determine the location for a while.\n\n\"What's going on?\" At this moment, Wang Jizhong, who was next to him, asked Zheng Daoguang, who had a serious expression.\n\nZheng Daoguang frowned, shook his head slightly, and said, \"I can't make out any clues. It's roughly in the southwest direction, but I don't know the exact location.\"\n\n\"I told you so...\"\n\n...\n\nAfter Wang Jizhong and Zheng Daoguang left, only Shen Lingdong and Yuan Yuan remained in the company.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said to Yuan Yuan, \"I was originally planning to write a murder mystery script during these two days of rest, but I didn't expect to be so busy with cases. I haven't had a moment to spare.\"\n\n\"Is writing a murder mystery as exciting as a real case?\" Yuan Yuan smiled slightly and said, \"If there's a chance, I'd also like to participate in the investigation.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said, \"You know the background of yesterday's case. If you were to write it, how would you write it?\"\n\nYuan Yuan thought for a moment and then said, \"I would write it as a crime of passion. Two men fighting for a woman, with Song Yu being the final murderer.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly, then said, \"The motive is there, but how would the murder be committed? And why commit it in his own room? After committing the murder, he spent a night in the same room as the deceased?\"\n\nYuan Yuan immediately said, \"Since the crime has been committed, one must be prepared for the worst. Moreover, if the police also think this way, the suspect's suspicion will be reduced. If a reasonable explanation can be provided, suspicion might even be ruled out. For the freedom of the rest of one's life, what is a room?\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Shen Lingdong softly agreed.\n\nYuan Yuan continued, \"Of course, to completely eliminate one's suspicion, one needs to have sufficient human and material evidence. Since the person died in the murderer's own room, and was a stranger, in the subsequent time, I would never stay alone in the room. I would try my best to create an alibi, such as inviting friends to karaoke or deliberately vomiting in the taxi during the ride to leave an impression on the driver.\"\n\n\"The next day, upon returning home, I would begin to fabricate the illusion that the deceased was still alive. Besides using a mobile phone, I could also track Li Jiachun to prove the deceased was still alive. On the other hand, I would find a way to dispose of the body. At this time, the best method would be to dump the body into a river. Firstly, the icy water would slow down the decomposition of the body. Secondly, if there are no special circumstances, the body would be discovered in the spring, at least one to two months later. It would be even more difficult for the police to determine the time of death. Even if they could estimate the general timeframe of death, the murderer would have fabricated the deceased's whereabouts, making it difficult for the police to trace the murderer.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said, \"There are a few issues. If you choose to dump the body, the previous efforts would be somewhat redundant. Neither surveillance footage nor the driver's memory would last that long. Secondly, you don't know the deceased's situation, their habits, or their family. If his family sees that he hasn't returned home, they might suspect something very quickly. Thirdly, the time of death of the deceased is not necessarily determined by the degree of decomposition of the body; the food in the stomach can also be used as a basis for determination. Fourth, the police can trace you. Once his relatives or friends mention that he hasn't returned home since New Year's Day, that time will become a node, and investigations will start from there, quickly leading to the murderer.\"\n\nYuan Yuan smiled slightly and said, \"That's why I'm still not popular. I still don't understand. I'm far from your level.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly said, \"It's already very good. To come up with a complete method in such a short time, some people might take several days to design such a means.\"\n\n\"So, my level is still okay then.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then said to Yuan Yuan, \"By the way, are those two here to help solve the case? Why are you here?\"\n\n\"To write... The heating in the apartment I rented is not good. Di Fang felt a bit cold in her room, so she came to my room. That's not all, she also kept peeking at my writing. That's what I can't stand the most. Whenever someone stands behind me, I feel like I can't write.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"I feel the same.\"\n\n\"I just didn't expect all of you to come,\" Yuan Yuan said with a hint of complaint.\n\n\"Then I won't disturb you. I'll go upstairs. You can take your time writing downstairs,\" Shen Lingdong said as he walked upstairs.\n\nArriving upstairs, Shen Lingdong immediately took out his phone and sent a message to Gu Caiwei, saying, \"Help me check if, in the cases of recent years, there have been instances where the murderer deliberately vomited in a car to fake an alibi, fabricated that the deceased was dumped into a river, and in winter, the murderer also faked the illusion that the deceased was still alive.\"\n\n\"No,\" Gu Caiwei replied immediately.\n\n\"So quickly, did you check?\"\n\n\"I used to work in the archives, and I know the basic situation of all cases, but there are no such situations as you mentioned. What's wrong? Why are you asking me to check this?\" Gu Caiwei asked.\n\nShen Lingdong then replied, \"I was just chatting with Yuan Yuan. I asked her to reconstruct a case through writing. She did it quickly, but I felt like she stitched together details from two different cases she had written before, and the logic wasn't very coherent. Since there are no such cases, have any similar scripts been found in Zhou Xinghuai's murder mystery script shop?\"\n\n\"I'll have to check that. There were so many scripts back then, and I didn't check them all. I only checked them according to the list provided by Captain Lin.\"\n\n\"Oh. Since it hasn't been checked yet, there's no rush. I can investigate it myself when I have time. After all, I have the authority now.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll get back to work then, Consultant Shen.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stayed upstairs for a while, then suddenly heard the voices of Wang Jizhong and Zheng Daoguang downstairs. Shen Lingdong hurried downstairs. Halfway down, he leaned on the railing and asked Zheng Daoguang and Wang Jizhong, \"The Fixture-Hunting Squad, how did your investigation go?\"\n\n\"It would be strange if anything could be found with this method,\" Wang Jizhong said with a smile, then sat down on a chair and picked up his thermos. Seeing that it was empty, he got up to get some water.\n\nZheng Daoguang said in a low voice, \"It's not that there was no effect at all. I have a vague feeling that the primary crime scene is in the southwest direction of the Xingfu Retirement Home, but there's nothing there except a park.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly, then said, \"This can be considered a discovery.\"\n\nZheng Daoguang looked at Shen Lingdong with satisfaction. Seeing that Shen Lingdong wasn't taking any action, he asked, \"Don't you believe us?\"\n\n\"We believe you,\" Shen Lingdong quickly replied.\n\n\"Then why aren't you going to investigate?\"\n\n\"Ah, this... I said the deceased was related to the Xingfu Retirement Home based on a previous speculation of mine, but I can't confirm whether my speculation is correct yet, so I can't confirm whether your discovery is correct either. Besides, even Lao Wang, who was with you, didn't notice anything unusual. If I go, I probably won't see anything either. So, let Captain Lin inform me of any news.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Shen Lingdong returned upstairs and began to reconstruct the layout of the Xingfu Retirement Home from memory.\n\nIf he remembered correctly, the southwest direction was exactly where the kitchen was located.\n\nJust then, his phone suddenly rang. It was Lin Xiangbei. Shen Lingdong quickly opened his phone.\n\nLin Xiangbei said, \"Sister Xi has confirmed that the burnt body was treated with rapid carbonization, instantly increasing the temperature, which caused less damage to the internal tissues. Furthermore, there is another important clue: if the ring on the deceased's hand was put on after death. If the rapid carbonization method was used, the area where the ring was worn would have different burn marks compared to other areas. Therefore, your guess might be correct.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly replied, \"So, the only person who could have access to a flamethrower is the cook who prepares meals for the elderly at the retirement home.\"\n\n\"Come to the station, let's talk in person. I'll arrange for someone to bring the cook from the retirement home.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly put on his coat and walked outside.\n\nHalf an hour later, Shen Lingdong had arrived at the Criminal Police Team, but the cook from the retirement home had not yet been brought in.\n\n...\n\nShen Lingdong sat in Lin Xiangbei's office, his expression grave.\n\nLin Xiangbei had the same expression.\n\nAlthough the cook at the retirement home was a major suspect, the evidence Lin Xiangbei had just obtained could prove that the cook had been at the retirement home for the entire day yesterday and had not left even half a step. Not only was there human testimony, but also surveillance video evidence.\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei slowly opened his mouth and said, \"Even if the cook could use a flamethrower, to carbonize a person's body surface would require a large amount of fuel. Without special circumstances, using a large amount of fuel would easily arouse suspicion. The best way is to use a flamethrower only when needed in certain situations.\"\n\n\"I found that on November 29th, the retirement home purchased a batch of pork from a slaughterhouse. Those pork were semi-finished products, so they needed to have the hairs removed from the pigs' bodies. Usually, hot water is used, but in this situation, small hairs would remain on the pigskin. To completely remove them, a flamethrower is usually used to bake off the hairs. This method is very fast, and many hotels use this method. The cook likely took advantage of this opportunity to kill the deceased.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly, then asked, \"Where was the location? The goods delivered to the retirement home were all sent to the warehouse. If it was a piece of pork, it could be taken to the kitchen for hair removal, but if it was an entire pig, it could only be handled in the warehouse. In that case, the murderer could only have committed the murder in the warehouse.\"\n\nJust then, a police officer entered Lin Xiangbei's office and reported: \"The cook, Xie Yousheng, has been brought back to the police station.\"\n\n7017k\n\n---\n¹Luopan: A Chinese magnetic compass, traditionally used in Feng Shui.",

If you have anything you want to ask, you can tell me through the headset,\" Lin Xiangbei said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Shen Lingdong replied, stood up, and walked with Lin Xiangbei towards the interrogation room.\n\nUpon arriving at the interrogation room, Shen Lingdong entered the adjacent monitoring room, while Lin Xiangbei walked towards the interrogation room.\n\nIn the interrogation room sat a plump middle-aged man, still wearing an oil-stained shirt. Seeing Lin Xiangbei appear, he quickly asked, \"Officer, is there some misunderstanding?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei sat down in a chair, picked up a form from the side, and asked, \"Name?\"\n\n\"Zhang Defa.\"\n\n\"Age?\"\n\n\"43.\"\n\nAfter filling in some necessary information, Lin Xiangbei got down to business and asked, \"What did you do on November 30, 2021?\"\n\nZhang Defa's face showed a hint of confusion. He said blankly, \"November 30th, it's been so long, I can't remember. But what I do every day is about the same: prepare dishes, cook, wash dishes...\"\n\n\"Let me remind you, on November 30th, Sheng Hua Slaughterhouse delivered two whole pigs.\"\n\nZhang Defa recalled slightly and then said, \"Ah, that day, after finishing the meals for the elderly, I went to process those two pigs. Later, I found that those two pigs hadn't been de-haired, and that day our area had a water outage for maintenance. Fearing not enough water, we just roasted them with fire.\"\n\n\"You were responsible for roasting them?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\nZhang Defa nodded, then said, \"I'm responsible for this kind of thing; others don't know how. Oh, Lao Guo helped me that day.\"\n\n\"Lao Guo? Who is he?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"Guo Mingyi. He's a caregiver. We have a good relationship. I don't know why, but he was so free that day, he even had time to help me work. I remember he didn't seem to have anything to do that day and was hanging around my kitchen. Later, the warehouse delivered two pigs, and they weren't de-haired. When I was about to go, Lao Guo said he wanted to help. At that time, I had other things to do, so I let him help. However, he's still not skillful enough. What normally takes an hour, he took two hours to finish. And although the pig hair was removed cleanly, some areas were scorched.\"\n\n\"Later, he helped me in the kitchen until evening. After work, I asked him, and he told me he wanted to borrow some money from me...\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated slightly and asked, \"Where is that Lao Guo? I didn't find anyone named Guo Mingyi on your nursing home's staff list.\"\n\n\"Hey, a week after I lent him the money, he resigned. I couldn't contact him during that time. The day before yesterday, he returned the money to me. He slipped an envelope under my door, and inside was three hundred yuan.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated slightly, then looked up in the direction of the monitor, and asked, \"Did you hear any strange shouts that day, like screams or anything?\"\n\n\"Screams? They were dead pigs...\"\n\nLin Xiangbei then said, \"But the warehouse of your nursing home doesn't seem suitable for processing pigs.\"\n\n\"That warehouse is really just for storing sundries. To prevent contact with outsiders, the nursing home has a large warehouse outside, which is west of the park. Most of the things we purchase are delivered there. There aren't many people there. Even if a pig were killed inside, it wouldn't disturb the people around.\"\n\n\"How long is the round trip?\" Lin Xiangbei continued to ask.\n\n\"About fifteen minutes,\" Zhang Defa replied. It was only then that he realized something might have happened, and he quickly asked, \"Did something happen at the warehouse? I've seen police cars entering and exiting the nursing home several times today.\"\n\n\"Just answer the questions.\"\n\n\"Oh, officer, don't worry. I'll tell you anything I know.\"\n\n\"Do you know where Guo Mingyi is now?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\nZhang Defa shook his head slightly, then said, \"After he resigned, I lost contact with him. I don't know what he's doing now. Moreover, even when he returned the money, he used an envelope. I was quite puzzled at the time.\"\n\n\"Alright, you can rest for now. If there are any questions, I'll find you again.\"\n\n\"Okay, officer.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei quickly left the interrogation room. As soon as he walked out the door, Shen Lingdong also emerged from the monitoring room next door. Both of them walked out together.\n\nAs they walked, Shen Lingdong said to Lin Xiangbei, \"The situation seems much clearer now.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, then said, \"We just don't know how much truth there is in what he said. Currently, Guo Mingyi has resigned and his whereabouts are unknown, so it will be difficult for us to verify. But at least we have new clues. If Zhang Defa wasn't lying, then Guo Mingyi is suspicious. If Zhang Defa was lying, then he is suspicious. Let's go and check out that warehouse.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then murmured to himself, \"It's really in that direction.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly. \"Oh, nothing. Old Zheng went to investigate this morning, and it was confirmed that the first crime scene was southwest of Xingfu Nursing Home. It seems to be quite plausible now.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei gave a dry laugh and continued walking forward.\n\nLeaving the police station, the two of them arrived at the park southwest of Xingfu Nursing Home. They split up to search, but the park was covered in snow, and any clues might have been covered. Moreover, given the killer's method of killing, it was unlikely to leave anything behind.\n\nShen Lingdong recalled the condition of the body. Under outdoor conditions, it wouldn't be easy to burn a body to that extent. It hadn't snowed at that time. If the body were placed directly on the ground and a flamethrower were used, there would be scorched marks on the surrounding grass. To deal with such marks, the best method would be to dig up the soil and turn it over.\n\nIf the weather had been consistently cold, it might have been possible to find signs of disturbed soil. However, the weather had been unpredictable recently, with periods of cold and heat, so the signs of disturbed soil might have disappeared.\n\nIt seemed almost impossible to find anything.\n\nHowever, from another perspective, the evidence was buried underground by the killer and sealed away. As long as that place was found, the truth would emerge.\n\nHowever, Shen Lingdong did not intend to search for that place. He planned to use the process of elimination. He would first walk around the park and eliminate all possible locations for the first crime scene. If those places were not it, then there would only be one possibility: the killer directly killed the victim on the ground. Although this park was large, if one were patient, one could always find it.\n\nThe park was neither too big nor too small; one could walk around it in less than twenty minutes.\n\nRather than calling it a park, it was more like a forest, with trees everywhere and occasional trash cans.\n\nLooking at it this way, the killer should have hidden the victim in a secluded corner. When going to the warehouse, he used the gas tank brought from the kitchen to kill the victim, and then went to the warehouse to process the pigs.\n\nWhat was originally an hour's work took two hours. Judging by the uniform degree of scorching on the victim, he wasn't unskilled but rather quite skilled. As for the uneven scorch marks on the pigs, they might have been intentional.\n\nShen Lingdong arrived at the center of the park and shouted loudly, \"Lin Xiangbei!\"\n\n\"Hey! I'm here!\"\n\nLin Xiangbei's response came from the north. Shen Lingdong then walked towards Lin Xiangbei's direction. He was near the edge of the park. Shen Lingdong looked at the road outside; there were many disorderly footprints on the ground.\n\n\"Did you find anything?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"Although few people pass by here, people still have to pass by. I was at the center just now. I called you at the normal volume of a person's cry of pain, and you heard it clearly. Doesn't the killer fear that others would hear the victim's screams?\"\n\n\"What if the killer couldn't speak?\" Lin Xiangbei said, pausing slightly before negating himself, \"This situation should be reflected in the victim's mouth.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then said, \"Could it be that the victim had a disease that caused them to fall into a coma? Also, the killer was in the nursing home before this. If the victim had mobility, how could the killer guarantee they wouldn't escape?\"\n\n\"That... you mentioned before that the scorched bodies are almost never the victim themselves. Could it be that in this murder case, it's also not the victim?\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Among the missing elderly, were there any vegetative patients or elderly people with speech impediments?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded, then said, \"There really was one. An elderly person who had lost their voice for many years. Perhaps we can check his son's DNA and compare it with the victim's DNA.\" Thinking of this, Lin Xiangbei quickly took out his phone and dialed Liao Jia, asking her to do this immediately.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong slowly opened his mouth and said, \"If you were the killer, where would you hide the victim?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei shook his head slightly, then said, \"I'm not sure. But I'm used to carrying important things with me. If they're not with me, I feel insecure.\"\n\n\"So, you would keep the victim with you at all times. When transporting the gas tank, you would also take the victim with you and bring them here.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and replied, \"That's about it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"I suddenly thought of something. Zhang Defa said Guo Mingyi was very free that day. If it were another position, it would be fine, but Guo Mingyi is a caregiver, and he needs to take care of the elderly's daily lives and is almost always by their side. Moreover, in Xingfu Nursing Home, one caregiver has to look after multiple elderly people. How could he be so idle?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, seemingly understanding Shen Lingdong's thoughts, and immediately made another call to confirm whether Guo Mingyi was on duty that day.\n\nA moment later, Lin Xiangbei received a reply. Guo Mingyi's name was not found on the duty roster for that day; he was on scheduled leave.\n\nLin Xiangbei cursed under his breath, saying, \"No wonder I never saw Guo Mingyi's name. On the day of the incident, his name wasn't on the duty roster at all. That's why he was so idle that day. However, Lu Guisen was not an elderly person cared for by Guo Mingyi, and he had no complaints about his boss. Why would he cruelly harm an elderly man over sixty? If there were any grudges, he had a conflict with another elderly person, the cause of which was that elderly person's daughter, who often found fault with Guo Mingyi.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stepped on the snow on the ground, making a crunching sound. He didn't speak but took out his mobile phone and searched for the park online.\n\nLin Xiangbei muttered to himself, \"It's getting dark. I guess that's it for today.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then slowly said, \"I do have a method to lure the killer to us.\"\n\n\"What method?\"\n\n\"Live streaming,\" Shen Lingdong said softly. \"Without revealing case details, live stream the search for clues, and then falsely claim in the live stream that clues have been found. If the killer sees the live stream, he will definitely be concerned about whether we will find clues. If the killer fears that the evidence will be discovered, he might come to check. At that time, the police ambushing nearby can apprehend him.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned slightly, then said, \"There are too many uncertainties. And a killer returning to the crime scene, no one would be foolish enough to do that, right?\"\n\n\"Let's try it, what if? During this time, we can also do some public legal education and increase public trust in the police. Moreover, I have a strong feeling that he will come.\"\n\n\"Why do you have such a feeling?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"Perhaps it's because I've been with Old Zheng for too long, and I feel some things are just very mystical.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated slightly, then said, \"Alright, I'll talk to the director. Police live streaming isn't like yours; you can live stream anytime, anywhere. We need to report it.\"\n\nLooking at the time, he added, \"Tomorrow.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then said, \"It's good that I can prepare as well.\"\n\n\"Prepare what?\"\n\n\"You'll know when the time comes,\" Shen Lingdong said with a smile.\n\n\"Being mysterious, acting spooky...\" Lin Xiangbei gave Shen Lingdong a glare.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"That's right, being spooky and mysterious.\"\n\nHearing Shen Lingdong say that, Lin Xiangbei seemed to know what Shen Lingdong intended to do. It must be Zheng Daoguang who would take action again.\n\nShen Lingdong then took out a recording device from his pocket, looked around, and then placed it on a thick tree trunk.\n\n\"You're even installing a monitoring device...\"\n\n\"Hehehe.\"\n\n7017k",

    "title": "Chapter 130 Live broadcast",
    "content": ", Special site cleaning staff\n\nThe next day, in the morning\n\nThe first thing Shen Lingdong did when he woke up was to ask Lin Xiangbei about whether the live broadcast was feasible\n\nIt took a long time later, Lin Xiangbei to return to Shen Lingdong. The Sun Bureau had agreed to Lin's request for live broadcast, but there were still restrictions on conditions, such as the inability to display the police inspection equipment and procedures.\n\nThis was enough for Shen Lingdong, so he hurriedly put on his clothes and headed towards the company.\n\nBefore going to the company, Shen Lingdong went to the park beside the Happy Nursing Home and took back the records he had hidden. Fortunately, he didn't do anything.\n\nWhen you come to the company, everyone is there\n\nAfter three days of vacation, the company has fully rebuilt today\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong came to the company, Shen Lingdong called Zheng Daoguang and Wang Ruizhong to the office on the building.\n\n\"What happened to that case?\" Wang Ruizhong asked\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at Zheng Daoguang, then opened his mouth slowly, \"The method of Lao Jun is really effective. We checked a park that was suspected to be found in the first case, which is on the southwest side of the Happy Nursing Home.\"\n\nAt this time, Zheng Daoguang said with a puzzled face, \"It's that park. Why can't we find such a visible place?\"\n\nShen Lingdong clicked the head and then said, \"There are more trees and trees in that place, but there are no entertainment facilities, but I found that there are quite a few trash cans in the park.\"\n\nWang Rui cried out at the head of the brow and then said, \"Why do you think there are still many people going there to play there? Otherwise, let's put so many trash cans and fuck them?\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"But I looked through the trash can, and there was not a lot of garbage inside.\" As he said, Shen Lingdong took out his mobile phone and showed it to the king.\n\nHe found a post posted by a netizen online, including the unknown garden in Dongjiang City.\n\nIn fact, he was originally a forest, and it only became popular in the past two years. At first, he was a foreigner who was traveling by himself. When he drove there, he accidentally discovered that place. He had a picnic with his family there, and also took videos and posted it online. Because of this video, the place was also popular. Every spring and summer, many people drove to it.\n\nEspecially in summer, some people have done measurements. The same tree forests are the same. The temperature there is three or four degrees lower than that of other park tree forests. Therefore, there are the most people going there in summer, so a lot of garbage will be left behind. Later, some trash cans were installed there, but everyone habitually threw garbage, and those trash cans became trash.\n\nThere are still people who go there to enjoy the fallen leaves in autumn, but there are obviously fewer than the other two seasons.\n\nShen Lingdong put away his cell phone, then looked at Zheng Daoguang and Wang Ruizhong, and then said, \"What do the two elders have any ideas?\"\"\n\nWang Ruizhong said slowly at this time: \"Although I didn't go in to check that park, I also took a look outside. There were common trees and there were no two different things like other parks. If it was said that because of the plants, the temperature there was lower than that in other places, then this situation could basically be ruled out.\"\n\nShen Lingdong also clicked the head and then said, \"I went in and saw it. There was nothing wrong with it. Moreover, even if I stood in the middle of the forest and shouted, I could hear it outside. Even if the sound could cause interference, the weather that day was really good.\"\n\nWang Ruizhong was slightly surprised and asked quickly, \"You remember that the weather is so bad.\"\n\n\"Of course I can't remember it, but someone has recorded it for me. The diary my mother wrote to my dad just happened to record the weather that day.\"\n\n\"That is, if the hand is there, it may be discovered by someone.\"\n\nShen Lingdong pointed at the head and said, \"It took so long that the deceased was exposed. I guess he was planning very carefully in that ring. He would definitely not do it if he could expose his own ring.\"\n\nWang Rui pointed out the same thing and said, \"I asked Lin Xiangbei to find out the case yesterday, and I also learned about the situation. I have a question. After being killed, the deceased was kept in a place. According to the police's evidence, the deceased was probably released before a ceremony. But there were two situations in which the car was bought at the processing factory five days ago. The deceased was in the seat inside. The outer shell of the car was later installed. Another possibility was that the hand-buying car was just a trick to mislead the police.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, and then he spoke quietly, \"This afternoon, the police will do a live broadcast in that park. It was a live broadcast for the sect. I didn't mention this. I forgot, I have to find someone to help you add OnePlus to the live broadcast room. In addition, you also started a live broadcast, using your mysticism to solve this murder case, such as being so angry, what a strange thing. In addition, you can also roughly describe the specialty of the sect.\"\n\n\"How do I describe this? I have never seen any pressure on my hands.\"\n\n\"Fortune Telling Quilt\"\n\n\"How can I calculate it here?\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately took out his phone, found a document, and said to Zheng Daoguang and Wang Ruizhong, \"This is the side I wrote about the hand last night. You can recite it. It's dangerous. Because there is one thing that doesn't match, the hand may believe it is fake, but if all match, then the hand will come on. I have already let Lin and Guardian Zhangwei write a side, Lao Wang, you can also write one. Let's combine it together and jump out a few more similar characteristics.\"\n\nWang Liu pointed the head and said, \"Okay, let me try it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong printed out two copies of the document and handed it to Wang Ruizhong and Zheng Daoguang respectively.\n\nZheng Daoguang followed, but Wang Ruizhong did not reach out, but instead said, \"I don't look at what you analyzed, I'm afraid it will affect my thinking.\"\"\n\nAt this moment, Yuan Yuan suddenly ran up the building and knocked on the door of Shen Lingdong's office. After entering the door, she said to Shen Lingdong: \"There is a girl under the building looking for you, and she is quite beautiful.\"\n\n\"Did she say what her name is?\"\n\n\"Lin Suqing\" Yuan Yuan replied immediately\n\nShen Lingdong snaked his eyebrows and then said to Yuan Yuan, \"Let her come up.\"\n\nAt this time, Wang Ruizhong also stood up, stretched out his waist and said, \"I haven't done a side for many years, I have to find a peaceful place.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he walked outside, and while walking, he also pulled Zheng Daoguang away.\n\nNot long after, Lin Suqing appeared at the door of the office and looked inside. Then she smiled and said, \"Is this place still good?\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly stood up and said to Lin Suqing, \"Dr. Lin, why are you here?\"\n\nHe said, picked up a chair from the side and sent it to Lin Suqing.\n\nLin Suqing smiled again and said, \"I heard from Jiawei that you had looked for me during the time I left. I'm back here, aren't you here to find you?\"\n\nShen Lingdong also echoed and laughed, \"Dr. Lin is so busy, just inform me of your voice when you come back.\"\n\n\"I'm busy, but you're not busy now. You're fine now. It's definitely not for the sake of post-mortem disease to come to me. I'm so angry, what are you looking for me?\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly stunned and then said, \"After so long, I forgot something.\"\n\nAt first he saw that Lin Suqing was not in his psychological clinic, and when Zhou Xingxing was arrested, he contacted him, he wondered if she had any contact with Zhou Xingxing.\n\nLin Suqing walked quietly to Shen Lingdong and said softly, \"Since you have nothing to do with me, then I have something to do with you.\"\n\nAt this time, her eyes were on Shen Lingdong's side report.\n\nThen he picked it up and turned over to prevent Shen Lingdong from robbing him.\n\n\"This is a secret, you can't read it.\" Shen Lingdong reminded Lin Suqing\n\n\"It turned out that it was the suspect's side to write a report, and it was quite good.\" Lin Suqing put the paper back on the table, held the table with both hands, and smiled with her lips: \"Do you want to listen to my analysis?\"\n\nShen Lingdong sniffed his eyebrows slightly, and lightly\n\n\"From my psychological analysis, the suspect used such a tolerant method to kill the deceased, and the old man of the deceased. He had no ability to resist, and even if he did not kill him, he did not have much time to explain the hatred of the deceased and came from the deceased's family. By using this method to report, it is very likely that the deceased's family had done something to the deceased's family.\"\n\n\"And the deceased was one of the elderly who had lost their homes in the past. The best way for the deceased to report is to make the deceased's family feel desperate. The deceased uses this to constantly to torture the deceased's family until the time is mature, and the deceased will not choose to commit the crime.\"\n\n\"This time machine is a time machine that can make him dismiss the suspicion. He will only take action when all the conditions are met.\"\n\n\"As such a dense plan, the condition that can be implemented is to enter the nursing home and become an employee, so from the beginning, his purpose of entering the nursing home is not simple.He did all this to revenge, or even to not care about his life and death. Do you think such a person will worry about the discovery of the rope and return to the scene?”\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly stunned. It turned out that he wanted to tell himself that his plan to lead the snake out of the hole was wrong.\n\nSeeing that Shen Lingdong didn't say anything, Lin Suqing continued, \"You are not pulling a snake out of the hole, but hitting a snake. He is not a murderer. He will not treat the body as his own work, nor will he return to the scene of the case. He appreciates the embarrassment of the police's failure to find the certificate.\"\n\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Shen Lingdong opened his mouth slowly, \"He will come.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Lin Suqing asked back\n\n\"I can't disclose the case details and plans like you.\"\n\nLin Suqing smiled and then said, \"If you are so confident, I look forward to you finding a hand.\"\n\nShen Lingdong clicked the head and said, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"By bye, I'll leave first.\" After saying that, Lin Suqing turned away even after\n\nWhen he reached the door, Lin Suqing suddenly turned back and said to Shen Lingdong: \"Sorry, I can't do anything about Zhao Xiaofei's mental illness. His situation is not within my business scope.\"\n\nAt this time, Shen Lingdong suddenly realized that he had contacted Lin Suqing to help Xiaofei adjust it, and let Xiaofei monitor look at Lin Suqing. He didn't expect that she had known it for a long time. Thinking about it, she had such a good relationship with Gun Shaowei. Why didn't Gun Shaowei tell him?\n\nHowever, the words he said seemed to have other meanings\n\nFrom a medical perspective, Zhao Xiaofei can be his patient, but Lin Suqing only uses business... So what exactly does she do\n\nAfter Lin Suqing left, Shen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then took out his records and directed the videos to the computer.\n\nAfter checking it, the video was 6 hours in total. Shen Lingdong really quickly read it and did not find any abnormal situations. So he paused the video, looked at the picture in the video, and rubbed his chin lightly.\n\nHe was thinking about Lin Suqing's words, and he was analyzing which head she was\n\nafternoon\n\nShen Lingdong drove to the side of the Happy Nursing Home. Instead of going to the venue, he parked the car on the road that was far away, sat in the car, took out his mobile phone to watch Lin Xiangbei and others' live broadcast. At the same time, he was also watching the comments on the live broadcast. Is there any stranger comments.\n\nThe police were conducting a carpet-style search in the park, and they were carrying medium and high-tech testers. Although at this time, the lens turned to other places, they just briefly introduced the instrument. It was a high-tech test, which was not convenient to display than advanced.\n\nOn the other hand, Lao Zheng also started the live broadcast, using the perspective of secretly filming to broadcast the police's search work. Occasionally, he also said some mysterious words. Of course, his live broadcast was not very popular.\n\nZheng Daoguang judged his position through Luo Zhuan, which made him really seem to be looking for a hand.It took not long before Zheng Daoguang suddenly stopped, stared at Luo Tong carefully, and even said the words in a model manner. This analysis brought a lot of popularity to his live broadcast. Shen Lingdong recorded the video of the \"fortune-telling\" pusher and sent it to Song Yu, so that he could help him post this video so that more people could see it as much as possible.\n\nIn the police investigation, although they used a carpet search, they did not find any trace after a few hours, but they still did not stop.\n\nKnowing that at night, I could no longer see the situation in the park, the police closed the live broadcast and found an important thread to the people in the live broadcast. The suspect had been locked and was ready to arrest him.\n\nIn fact, the police didn't have any traces\n\nHowever, after the police left, a group of policemen were left behind, guarding the surroundings of the park, monitoring the people entering and leaving the park.\n\nUntil the eleven o'clock in the middle of the night, a person seemed to have drunk too much and walked into the park. He seemed to suddenly feel the urge to pee. He looked around and then walked into the park.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at the person and then said to his subordinates: \"Don't arrest anyone, Group A will follow him.\"\n\nNot long after, a man and a woman appeared. After seeing the tree forest, the man pretended to take the girl on the path, but the girl seemed to disagree, but the boy was dragged into the tree forest. The girl shouted help.\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated for a moment, and then said to his subordinates, \"Go in and bring those two people out.\"\n\nAlthough he knew that this might be a smoke fog that his hand deliberately released, he had to risk the exposure to enter the park.",

    "title": "Chapter 131: The nurse",
    "content": "**Chapter 131: The Caregiver**\n\nThe couple who were acting were brought into the car by Lin Xiangbei. After a brief interrogation, it turned out they weren't faking. Although their plan was exposed, they had, after all, prevented a potential crime.\n\nHowever, from that point on, no one entered the woods until 2 AM, and for a long time, no one even passed by that section of the road.\n\nLin Xiangbei also planned to call it a day.\n\nShen Lingdong, however, had no intention of leaving. After Lin Xiangbei and his team withdrew, Shen Lingdong drove his own car away. After two blocks, he stopped again and walked back into the woods.\n\nHe placed his recorder back on a tree trunk, sprinkled a thin layer of snow beneath the tree, and then left.\n\nThe next morning.\n\nShen Lingdong returned to the woods, intending to retrieve his recorder, but found it missing. Shen Lingdong then bent down and began to examine the footprints on the ground. A new footprint appeared on the snow he had sprinkled the previous night.\n\nAnalysis of the shoe print indicated it was from a casual shoe with severe wear. The shoe size was approximately 25 cm, and there seemed to be a small stone stuck in the tread.\n\nThe stride length was about 60 cm, and the left footprint showed a slight sweeping mark.\n\nBased on this footprint information, Shen Lingdong began to search outwards from his own position, photographing each footprint he found.\n\nAmidst the woods covered in footprints, Shen Lingdong only paid attention to this one type of footprint, automatically ignoring all others.\n\nHowever, Shen Lingdong soon discovered that these footprints were somewhat chaotic, not representing a single path but indicating multiple wanderings within the woods, seemingly without purpose.\n\nCould this person not be the killer, but just a passerby who accidentally stumbled into the woods?\n\nOr perhaps they were there to interfere?\n\nAfter collecting most of the footprints, Shen Lingdong returned to the company.\n\nHe went straight to his office on the second floor.\n\nHe opened his computer, imported all the photos he had taken, roughly sketched a map of the woods, and then arranged the footprints on it according to their distribution.\n\nThis person had entered the woods from the northeast and left in the same direction, entering and exiting twice. The southeast direction was towards the Happy Retirement Home.\n\nWhy would they enter and exit the woods twice? Did they forget to bring something the first time? Did they bring tools the second time to destroy the scene?\n\nShen Lingdong then used the angle of the steps to determine their approximate path. Even though the footprints were complex, he could generally ascertain the direction of travel. In this way, the routes for both entries into the woods were mapped out, but the order of the two routes could not be determined.\n\nOne route was quite clear. After entering the woods, although there was some hesitation, the person stopped a little south of the center.\n\nThey seemed to have stayed there for a long time, looking around, and then left.\n\nThe next day, the person wandered aimlessly in the woods, but the footprints became chaotic near the tree where he had placed his recorder. Shen Lingdong deduced that it was at this time that the suspect discovered his recorder on the tree and removed it.\n\nTherefore, the suspect likely went to handle the first crime scene first, and then, after discovering his recorder, returned home to get tools before taking his recorder.\n\nBut... it didn't seem necessary.\n\nAlthough he had tied the recorder to the tree, it could have been dislodged with ordinary branches, which were not scarce in the woods, making it unnecessary to return home for tools. Moreover, his purpose for placing the recorder this time was to let the suspect discover it, hence he had turned on the indicator light.\n\nThe route taken the first time, although it didn't pass under the tree with the recorder, was not far. In the dark woods, it could have been discovered even from a greater distance. Knowing there was a recorder and still going to the first crime scene was a strange behavior.\n\nWas he not afraid it was a real-time surveillance camera?\n\nIf he first discovered the camera, removed it, returned home, and then returned to the woods again...\n\nHe must have watched the content of the recorder. He must have found something in it that made him return to the scene a second time.\n\nThis explanation made sense.\n\nFurthermore, his home was very close to the woods, so returning twice wouldn't take too much time; otherwise, there would be no need to return.\n\nAnother point was that he entered the woods from the southeast direction, so he should have come from the direction of the retirement home. There were surveillance cameras at the entrance of the retirement home, and people inside shouldn't be coming out. So, it should be a residential area behind the retirement home, where the retirement home staff dormitories were located.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then went downstairs and said to Wang Jizhong and the others who were chatting, \"Grab the tools, we're going to be volunteers at the Happy Retirement Home.\"\n\nZheng Daoguang quickly said, \"In this cold weather, isn't it better to rest? Why do we have to do a thankless job?\"\n\nWang Jizhong's reaction was quicker, and he immediately asked, \"Did you find something?\"\n\n\"A few clues.\"\n\nWhile the others were packing, Shen Lingdong sent a message to Lin Xiangbei, explaining the general situation, but stated that he couldn't identify the killer. He planned to investigate first and asked for two police officers to accompany them as cleaning staff. If the suspect was found, they could arrest him immediately.\n\nLin Xiangbei agreed and arranged for two officers to wait for them en route. After meeting up, they would head to the Happy Retirement Home together.\n\nOn the way, Shen Lingdong met the two police officers. They were in plain clothes and drove their private cars, following Shen Lingdong to the Happy Retirement Home. On the way, Shen Lingdong bought some fruit, planning to visit the elderly residents.\n\nAfter entering the Happy Retirement Home, Shen Lingdong communicated with the person in charge and began the cleaning work.\n\nThere weren't many people, but many rooms, so it took a long time to clean.\n\nWang Jizhong cleaned meticulously, not missing any details, but Shen Lingdong wasn't as thorough. He often slacked off and chatted with the employees.\n\nAs evening approached, there were no clues.\n\nThe two police officers were getting anxious. So, they had spent a day as free labor with no clues?\n\nJust then, Shen Lingdong noticed a caregiver walking into the courtyard. He was about 1.7 meters tall and weighed around 55 kilograms, which fit the height and weight he had inferred from the suspect's footprints.\n\nFurthermore, his left foot tended to turn outward slightly when he walked, which would also cause a slight sweeping mark.\n\nWhen he passed by Shen Lingdong, Shen Lingdong stopped talking and could faintly hear a \"dada\" sound, which was the sound of a stone hitting the ground. The sound was very faint, and without careful listening or a noisy environment, it would be inaudible.\n\nShen Lingdong observed the caregiver. He was a middle-aged man, around fifty years old, with a somewhat blank look in his eyes.\n\nShen Lingdong then stepped forward, placed his hand on the middle-aged man's shoulder, and quietly asked, \"Brother, there's a stone stuck in the sole of your shoe.\"\n\nThe caregiver was slightly stunned, then looked at his right foot, found no stone, and then looked at his left foot.\n\nHe was surprised to see a pea-sized stone lodged in the seam of his shoe sole.\n\nUpon seeing this, the two police officers also stopped their work and moved towards the caregiver. However, they saw that Shen Lingdong was merely pointing out the stone in his shoe and prepared to turn back.\n\nThe caregiver immediately picked out the stone and then smiled, saying, \"Thanks, man.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly, then bent down, picked up the stone, took out an evidence bag, and put the stone in it. Then he said, \"Can I have my recorder back?\"\n\nThe caregiver was immediately startled and prepared to flee.\n\n\"Slow down, careful, it's slippery there. I just finished mopping.\"\n\nThe caregiver slipped and fell. He slid several meters on the icy stone brick ground, falling right at the feet of the two police officers.\n\nThe two police officers then helped the caregiver up and handcuffed him.\n\n\"Consultant Shen, is he the person you want to apprehend?\" one of the police officers asked.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"Just take him back. Captain Lin knows the details.\"\n\n\"Consultant Shen, we'll be going back now.\"\n\n\"Thanks a lot. Even though this is a volunteer activity, I'll still pay you. I'll give the wages to Captain Lin later.\"\n\n\"No, really, no need. We'd be criticized if we accepted payment.\"\n\n\"Then thank you both for your help.\"\n\nAfter the two police officers left, Zheng Daoguang also started packing. Shen Lingdong looked at the few remaining rooms that hadn't been cleaned and said, \"Let's finish what we started. Let's clean the remaining rooms before leaving.\"\n\nZheng Daoguang helplessly continued his work.\n\nAfter finishing the work, Shen Lingdong hurriedly drove to the criminal investigation team.\n\nLin Xiangbei was interrogating the caregiver, while Shen Lingdong waited in the lounge. Feeling a bit bored, Shen Lingdong looked at the dirty floor and the mop in the corner...\n\nA short while later, Lin Xiangbei came out of the interrogation room and entered the lounge, seeing Shen Lingdong mopping the floor.\n\n\"Oh, what are you doing? Aren't you tired after cleaning all day?\"\n\n\"The floor is too dirty, I can't stand it. How's the interrogation of that caregiver going?\"\n\n\"His name is Luo Rong. He's a long-time employee of the Happy Retirement Home. He was taken in initially. He was a homeless person, and Lu Shitu, seeing his pitiable state, arranged for him to stay at the retirement home. Later, he became a caregiver there. His intelligence is slightly below average, but not by much; normal life is fine for him.\n\nThree years ago, after work, he went to the supermarket across the road to buy some alcohol. On his way back, he accidentally heard a cry for help in the woods. When he went to investigate, he saw a man assaulting a woman.\n\nHe knocked the man down with a bottle of alcohol. The man lay on the ground motionless. He thought he had killed someone and immediately ran home.\n\nWhen he came to his senses and decided to dispose of the body, returning to the woods, he found that the man had disappeared, and the woman had also disappeared. The only thing left at the scene was the broken bottle. He buried the broken bottle under a tree.\n\nHowever, he has always believed that he killed someone.\n\nHe was very scared during that time, but he didn't run away.\n\nHe had almost forgotten about it until yesterday. When we were searching for evidence at the scene, it made him realize that the evidence of his murder was still in the woods, and he wanted to see if the evidence of his murder had been discovered.\n\nHowever, the first time he entered the scene, he took your recorder. Curious about its contents, he planned to go home and check. Halfway, he remembered that he had forgotten his purpose, so he returned to check. After confirming that his clues had not been discovered, he went home.\n\nWe investigated a case of female assault and murder from three years ago and found a suspect. At that time, he had an injury on his head, which could very well be the perpetrator he injured that day.\n\nFurthermore, I have arranged for him to be sent home and for your recorder to be returned.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and then asked, \"This case he mentioned is unrelated to our current case, meaning that there was another murder in that forest?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded.\n\n\"No wonder Old Zheng's compass failed there. It's possible that because two murders occurred there, the magnetic field disruption prevented him from finding the first crime scene.\"\n\n\"Alright, now you're even making excuses with metaphysics.\"\n\n\"It's eerie there, and the temperature is lower than elsewhere. That could also be the reason.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that yourself?\" Lin Xiangbei retorted.\n\n\"The low temperature wasn't my idea; it's a unanimous opinion from the vast majority of netizens. If you don't believe me, I'll show you proof.\" Shen Lingdong took out his phone, found a post, and showed it to Lin Xiangbei.\n\n\"I'm not looking. But if this news gets out, I'm afraid no one will go to that place anymore.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and flipped through the photos taken by those people.\n\nSuddenly, Shen Lingdong frowned.\n\nLin Xiangbei noticed Shen Lingdong's expression change and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"I saw a few dead trees.\"\n\n\"What's strange about that?\"\n\n\"I saw a few dead trees in photos taken by others before, but they didn't seem to be in the same location, and these trees have more or less some cracks.\"\n\n\"Isn't it normal for trees to crack after they die?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and then said, \"How did you feel when you passed by the underground parking lot entrance in the summer?\"\n\n\"A bit cold.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"The cracks on those dead trees are equivalent to the entrances of underground parking garages.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei was suddenly shocked and quickly asked, \"Are you saying there's something beneath that forest?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded. \"If that's the case, then the ground wouldn't leave any traces when the killer was committing the crime, and even if sounds were made, they wouldn't be heard by people outside.\"",

    "content": "Special Scene Cleanup Master - Chapter 132: Underground Warehouse\n\nLin Xiangbei fully agreed with Shen Lingdong's statement and immediately arranged for his subordinates to search the woods and its surroundings again.\n\nYesterday, they had conducted a thorough search of the woods and found no signs of an entrance or exit. Therefore, if there was indeed a space beneath the woods, the entrance should be on the outskirts.\n\nJust then, Song Hai entered the lounge holding a laptop and said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Captain Lin, we got Shen Consultant's recorder back. Here's the video exported from it.\"\n\nHe then stood beside Lin Xiangbei and played several key segments for him.\n\nAfter watching the video, Lin Xiangbei nodded and said, \"The content in the video is basically consistent with Luo Rong's confession.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he returned the recorder to Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the recorder and asked Song Hai, \"Is the video still in it?\"\n\nSong Hai quickly nodded, \"Yes, it's still in it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then put the recorder away, stood up, and said, \"Then I'll go back and study the video. You can inform me if you find anything.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded.\n\nShen Lingdong walked out and left the Criminal Police team.\n\nLin Xiangbei, holding Song Hai's laptop, continued to watch the video. Although Song Hai had extracted some clips for him, he still wanted to review it himself to be sure.\n\nLuo Rong appeared in the woods at 4 AM. He also shone a flashlight on the camera, and the video recorded up to the point where he removed the recorder. However, the recorder was not turned off and continued to follow Luo Rong's perspective back home until its memory was full, at which point it stopped recording.\n\nThe video started recording at 12:30 AM.\n\nFor nearly three and a half hours, there was almost no sign of anything unusual.\n\nAfter their live broadcast ended yesterday, they remained hidden in the original location for a considerable period. During this time, two groups of people entered the woods. The first was a drunk person, and the second was a couple. To prevent the man's crime, they chose to reveal themselves. If the suspect saw this situation, they would definitely not show themselves, and even after the police left, they would not come out for a while.\n\nIf he worried about evidence being exposed, he might lie low for a period, waiting for the police to leave completely and ensuring complete safety before entering the scene to inspect it.\n\nBased on the clues they had just analyzed, the entrance to the underground space might be on the outskirts of the woods, so he wouldn't need to enter the woods at all.\n\nHowever, fortunately, Shen Lingdong's camera was directed towards the southeast, which was the direction of the Happy Elderly Care Home. Moreover, there was no moon yesterday, and it was pitch black outside at that time. Without external light sources, it was impossible to see the road clearly.\n\nAlthough the people in the distance were not visible in the video, the light sources in the distance could be seen.\n\nIf the suspect used an external light source and happened to appear in the video, it could be discovered.\n\nOf course, the probability of this happening was very low.\n\nLin Xiangbei and Song Hai watched the video almost frame by frame, and they didn't find anything unusual until Luo Rong appeared.\n\nLin Xiangbei then pulled the progress bar back and followed Luo Rong's perspective back home. He held the recorder in his hand, and although it swayed, some scenes of other places could be seen.\n\nAfter watching for less than three minutes, Lin Xiangbei felt a wave of dizziness.\n\nHe immediately pressed pause and rubbed his eyes.\n\nAt this moment, Song Hai suddenly pointed at the screen and said, \"Captain Lin, what is this?\"\n\nIn a pile of weeds, two points of light could be faintly seen.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned and then said to Song Hai, \"Increase the brightness.\"\n\nSong Hai immediately increased the exposure of the video. When it was maximized, a human-shaped trace clearly appeared.\n\nLin Xiangbei sat up straight and immediately took out his phone, calling the team members who were searching the woods to inform them of this clue.\n\nAt the same time, he walked outside, preparing to go and see the scene.\n\nHalfway to the site by car, Lin Xiangbei received a call from a team member. They had found an entrance to the underground warehouse near the pile of weeds.\n\nLin Xiangbei then called Shen Lingdong again.\n\nWhen Lin Xiangbei and Shen Lingdong arrived at the woods, the scene had already been cordoned off.\n\nAs soon as they got out of the car, a police officer walked up and reported their findings. Ten years ago, the location of the Happy Elderly Care Home was planned to be a large vegetable market. However, the owner was arrested halfway through construction, and the project was halted. At that time, not many people knew that the owner had also privately dug an underground warehouse, and only some of the construction workers at the time knew about it.\n\nLater, the vegetable market was not built. After being idle for a few years, the land was acquired by Lu Shitu, who built the elderly care home.\n\nThe entrance to the warehouse was also blocked by a heavy rain.\n\nGuo Mingyi was one of the workers from that time.\n\nHe might have secretly cleared out the entrance and reactivated this place.\n\nLin Xiangbei and Shen Lingdong entered the underground warehouse through the entrance hidden in the pile of weeds. After walking through a passage, they faced a large iron gate with a padlock.\n\nThey stepped forward to examine it. Although the iron gate was rusty, the lock was very new, and there were many scratch marks on the keyhole, indicating recent use.\n\nLin Xiangbei then asked the team members to extract fingerprints from the lock.\n\nHe also asked the team members to call a locksmith to open the lock.\n\nHalf an hour later, the locksmith arrived and opened the lock with a few skillful moves.\n\nThe police entered the underground warehouse.\n\nThe underground warehouse covered an area of about three to four hundred square meters. Apart from being cold and damp, there was no peculiar odor inside.\n\nUpon entering the scene, Shen Lingdong looked around with a flashlight. To his surprise, there were several beds inside. Judging by their appearance, they were beds from the Happy Elderly Care Home, although they were somewhat damaged, likely replacements that had been replaced.\n\nThere were signs of more than one person living there. Could it be that all the elderly people who disappeared from the Happy Elderly Care Home were held here?\n\n\"Immediately extract fingerprints, hair, and skin cells and take them back for testing,\" Lin Xiangbei said, pointing to the beds.\n\nAt this time, Shen Lingdong continued to examine other areas and soon found a blackened spot. He then bent down to inspect it.\n\nAfter observing for a moment, he said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Captain Lin, the first crime scene has been found.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hurried over, shone his flashlight around, and then called the team members who remained at the Criminal Police team. \"Arrest Guo Mingyi.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stood up and slowly said, \"Although we haven't had any leads on Guo Mingyi, the fact that he appeared here this morning proves that he is still in Dongjiang City. As long as he hasn't left Dongjiang City, it will be easier to handle.\"\n\n\"What was his purpose in imprisoning these people here?\" Lin Xiangbei asked doubtfully.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then said, \"Lu Guisen's body had undergone gigantification, but no substances like blood or burnt tissue residue were found here. Therefore, the suspect transferred the body to another location after committing the crime.\"\n\n\"He has other places to hide bodies?\" Lin Xiangbei looked around and then continued, \"This place is so hard to find, and there are no records of it in our police system. This would be the best place to hide a body, wouldn't it?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at the ceiling. There were several ventilation openings, which should have used the dead trees as ventilation shafts. If the body were hidden here, it would be fine in winter, but in summer, the smell of decaying bodies would spread through the ventilation shafts, especially in summer when there were many people above, and someone would surely notice.\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and said, \"Then where would he hide the body?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Why would the suspect harm these elderly people?\"\n\n\"Could Guo Mingyi have some psychological issues?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then said, \"It's possible. I think we overlooked something in our profiling, which is the relationship between the killer and the elderly people's families. We almost always leaned towards the victims' families offending the killer, but the marks on the iron gate handle are definitely formed over many years. The killer must have done this kind of thing frequently. We can investigate all the elderly people who have gone missing from the Happy Elderly Care Home over the years.\"\n\n\"If the killer has some special hobby and enjoys torturing people, then his targets should be lonely elderly people without families. Even if they suddenly disappeared, no one would pursue it. However, looking at the previous disappearance of seven elderly people, the vast majority of them had children. Choosing such elderly people as targets is not a good choice, so I suspect... the killer is acting on behalf of someone else.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned slightly and then said to Shen Lingdong, \"Let's go back to the police station first. I'll show you the clues that we, the police, have.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nThey returned to the police station. Lin Xiangbei handed a report to Shen Lingdong and said, \"This is the data we obtained from the Happy Elderly Care Home. Before the disappearance of the seven elderly people, the police had no cases related to the Happy Elderly Care Home. However, we found twelve cases of elderly people leaving the care home. Three of them were due to family reasons, moving to other cities, and the elderly people also needed to change their care homes. The other nine cases involved elderly people who ran home to see their grandchildren, were picked up by their families, or got lost.\"\n\n\"However, these cases all had one thing in common: the elderly people died within three days of leaving the care home, with various causes of death, such as accidents or illnesses.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the reports and then slowly said, \"I have an idea, it's a bit shocking, do you want to hear it?\"\n\n\"Speak,\" Lin Xiangbei said.\n\n\"The person who wants to kill those elderly people is not Guo Mingyi, but the children of those elderly people?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei was startled and quickly said, \"Although there are all sorts of people, there shouldn't be many people like that, right?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, \"I don't quite believe it either. This is just a wild guess of mine.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated slightly. Since Shen Lingdong had proposed this idea, although it was hard to believe, it had some logic. He took out his phone and asked his team members to check the accounts of the children of those elderly people, as well as Guo Mingyi's account.\n\nNot long after, Gu Caiwei knocked on Lin Xiangbei's office door with a report and said, \"Captain Lin, I have checked the accounts of the elderly people's families and Guo Mingyi. There have been quite a few transactions, with them transferring money to Guo Mingyi, ranging from fifty thousand to one hundred thousand.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei glanced at the report and handed it to Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"Moreover, we just found Guo Mingyi's account. He bought a train ticket ten minutes ago,\" Gu Caiwei said. \"However, I have already notified my colleagues to intercept him. There are two colleagues nearby.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei immediately stood up and said, \"He's trying to escape! Caiwei, you did a great job. But two people are too few. I'll go myself.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he put on his clothes and walked out.\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at Gu Caiwei and then said, \"Not bad, are you moonlighting at the Criminal Police team now?\"\n\nGu Caiwei smiled and said, \"Isn't there a shortage of staff? Our Aftercare Team has also become the Logistics Team.\"\n\nSince Lin Xiangbei was not in the room, Shen Lingdong and Gu Caiwei could not stay there any longer. They then walked towards the lounge.\n\nSome time passed.\n\nLin Xiangbei sent a message to Shen Lingdong stating that Guo Mingyi had been apprehended.\n\nNot long after, Guo Mingyi was brought back to the Criminal Police team and sent directly to the interrogation room. Lin Xiangbei personally conducted the interrogation, while Shen Lingdong went to the adjacent surveillance room to watch his every move.\n\nAfter recording Guo Mingyi's basic information and seeing that he was very cooperative, Lin Xiangbei leaned back in his chair, looking at Guo Mingyi with a relaxed demeanor, and said, \"Tell me, why did you kill Lu Guisen in such a cruel manner?\"\n\nA hint of confusion appeared on Guo Mingyi's face, and he then slowly said, \"I didn't kill Lu Guisen. I was also curious about this matter. I clearly killed Ding Weilian, so why are you calling him Lu Guisen? It's precisely because of this that I've started to doubt if I killed the wrong person.\"\n\n\"Ding Weilian?\" Lin Xiangbei frowned slightly.\n\nHe was also one of the elderly people who had gone missing along with the other six elderly people.\n\nGuo Mingyi nodded and then said, \"That morning, I heard about the disappearance of elderly people from the hospital. I didn't know who it was, but I happened to be planning to deal with Ding Weilian, so I secretly transported him out of the elderly care home. When the elderly care home conducted an investigation, a total of seven elderly people were found missing. Ding Weilain's disappearance was naturally linked to the disappearance of the other elderly people.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 133 Really",
    "content": ", Special Scene Cleanup Technician\n\nLin Xiangbei pondered for a moment, then slowly said, \"Tell me, the process of you murdering Ding Weilin...\"\n\nGuo Mingyi recalled slightly and then said, \"It wasn't my shift that day. I had already taken a day off. At four in the morning, someone knocked on the dormitory door, asking me to gather at the nursing home to search for a few missing elderly residents. At that time, two caregivers reported to their superiors that the elderly residents they were looking after had suddenly disappeared, asking us to help them search. I thought this was a good opportunity, so I took the chance to secretly transport the elderly resident I was looking after, Ding Weilin, out of the nursing home.\"\n\n\"Although the environment of our nursing home is very good, the surveillance cameras are not fully covered. Especially the west gate. Most of us employees use that path, but there are no cameras on that road. It's been like this for many years, which has provided me with convenience.\"\n\n\"While everyone was looking for the missing elderly residents, I transported Ding Weilin to a nearby underground warehouse, which is underground in the adjacent park. Many years ago, it was intended to be an underground warehouse for storing vegetables. At that time, the owner did not plan to build a cold storage, so he intended to use the underground warehouse method to preserve vegetables. I was working as a laborer on the construction site at the time and participated in the construction team. Later, the owner was arrested and owed the bank a lot of money, so the project was delayed. The land originally intended for building a vegetable market was auctioned off by the court to our current boss, Lu Shitu.\"\n\n\"I took Ding Weilin to the underground warehouse and locked him up. I would bring him some food and meals every day until November 30th. That was when I planned to make my move. It wasn't my shift that day, but I chose to stay to find an opportunity, because I knew that a batch of pigs would be delivered today, and I could take the opportunity to act. I was busy in the kitchen back and forth, all to find an opportunity. Later, I chose to help Luo Rong handle those pigs, which was a perfect chance to deal with Ding Weilin using a flamethrower.\"\n\n\"After finishing with the pigs, I took the flamethrower to the underground warehouse, burned Ding Weilin to death, and then returned to the nursing home.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei listened to Guo Mingyi's recollection, hesitated, and then asked, \"Why did you kill Ding Weilin? Moreover, there was a long period between the date of his disappearance and the date of Ding Weilin's death. Why didn't you act? What were you waiting for?\"\n\nGuo Mingyi was somewhat hesitant. After a pause, he said softly, \"For money. From the day the nursing home was built, I have been an employee here. I have seen many elderly residents and their children. Some children send their parents to the nursing home because they don't have time to take care of them, while others consider their parents a burden. Of course, some elderly people are not stupid. If their children treat them badly, they won't leave their inheritance to them. I've heard several elderly people say that some make wills and leave their inheritance to their grandchildren, while others intend to donate their inheritance directly to the nursing home. Some elderly people have indeed donated their assets to the nursing home.\"\n\n\"By chatting with those elderly people and observing them, I looked for children who wanted to take huge inheritances from their parents. Although they wanted their parents to die before making a will, they couldn't bring themselves to do it, so they hired me to do it on their behalf. Afterwards, they would give me some compensation,\" Guo Mingyi said expressionlessly, as if what he was recounting was just an ordinary business transaction.\n\nSeeing Guo Mingyi's demeanor, Lin Xiangbei sighed helplessly and then asked, \"How many cases have you committed in total?\"\n\n\"Only this one.\"\n\n\"I advise you to tell the truth. If I didn't have some evidence, would I ask you this?\"\n\n\"Let me think. It really seems to be only this one,\" Guo Mingyi said, recalling.\n\n\"I collected different DNA samples from the underground warehouse, and I also found transfers from different people into your bank account.\"\n\n\"Oh, although my methods were a bit improper, I was exceptionally meticulous in taking care of the elderly. So, after the elderly residents left, their families gave me some money to thank me for taking care of their parents. That's not illegal, is it?\" Guo Mingyi said with a smile.\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned and looked at Guo Mingyi. If they only admitted to killing Ding Weilin and showed a good attitude of confessing, they might be sentenced to death with a reprieve. However, if they admitted to all the murder cases, it would basically be an immediate execution.\n\nAs it appeared now, Guo Mingyi still had a glimmer of hope to survive.\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated for a moment and said, \"I'll give you some more time. Think it over carefully.\"\n\nAfter saying that, he left the interrogation room and went to the monitoring room.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Guo Mingyi in the interrogation room and then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"He knows that there is no evidence for the previous murder cases. The victims have been cremated, and all evidence is gone. Now, our only breakthrough is the families of those elderly residents. However, he clearly killed Ding Weilin, so why did we find Lu Guisen as the victim? Also, why did he transport the body to the underground parking lot of Lanhe Community?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei pondered for a moment and said, \"We should invite the families of those deceased elderly residents for questioning.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he sent a message to Gu Caiwei, asking her to handle this matter.\n\nShen Lingdong dragged his feet, lost in thought, and did not speak.\n\nLin Xiangbei patted Shen Lingdong on the shoulder and then said, \"Take your time to think, I'll go back and ask him again.\"\n\nWith that, Lin Xiangbei returned to the interrogation room.\n\n\"You found evidence so quickly?\" Guo Mingyi's words seemed to carry a hint of provocation.\n\nLin Xiangbei ignored Guo Mingyi, walked straight to the chair, and asked Guo Mingyi, \"After you killed Ding Weilin, how did you dispose of his body?\"\n\nGuo Mingyi's eyes flickered slightly, then he slowly said, \"I disposed of it. I just found a deserted place and disposed of it. According to the plan, his son would retrieve the body and bury him, claiming death from illness to the outside world.\"\n\n\"What about the ring on the victim's hand?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"Ring? I didn't see any ring,\" Guo Mingyi's eyes showed a hint of bewilderment.\n\nLin Xiangbei continued, \"Where did you dump the body, at what time, what transportation did you use, what clothes were you wearing, what pants, what shoes?\"\n\nGuo Mingyi swallowed and then said, \"After wrapping the body in a garbage bag, I threw the body into... into a deserted garbage heap at a little past one in the morning. As for the clothes... I forgot. But I only have a few sets of clothes, so I really forgot which one I wore at the time.\"\n\n\"How long did it take from the underground warehouse to your dumping site?\" Lin Xiangbei asked.\n\n\"About half an hour,\" Guo Mingyi replied.\n\n\"Where is the deserted garbage heap you mentioned?\" Lin Xiangbei pressed relentlessly, giving Guo Mingyi no time to think.\n\n\"About three kilometers west of the nursing home, there is a deserted garbage heap, where I placed the body.\"\n\n\"And then the victim's family went there to retrieve the body, right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You say that, and I will naturally get in touch with the victim's family. Besides, I have another question: when you dumped the body, did you dispose of the clothes you were wearing?\"\n\n\"I disposed of them.\" Guo Mingyi replied.\n\n\"You don't have many clothes to begin with. Didn't you remember losing that piece of clothing?\"\n\nGuo Mingyi's expression became flustered, and then he said, \"I can't remember. Maybe I didn't dispose of it. I have a bad memory.\"\n\n\"It's okay, I'll find out. Luo Rong should remember what you were wearing at the time. If I find out...\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lin Xiangbei stood up and walked out.\n\n\"Wait, if I tell you now, can I still get a lighter sentence?\"\n\n\"It depends on your performance,\" Lin Xiangbei said softly.\n\nGuo Mingyi lowered his head and slowly said, \"Alright, I'll tell you. After burning Ding Weilin to death, I left his body in the underground warehouse. Because only I knew about that place, and the entrance was extremely hidden, I wasn't worried about anyone discovering it. I returned to the nursing home, returned the trolley and tools to Luo Rong, and then borrowed some money from him under an excuse.\"\n\n\"Later, when I prepared to return to the underground warehouse, the door was locked, but the body was gone. After that, I don't know what happened?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated and then asked, \"How many days did you go missing after that? You had ample opportunity to leave Dongjiang City, so why did you stay here?\"\n\n\"Money. Ding Weilin's son didn't see the body, so he couldn't declare his father dead and couldn't get the inheritance. They wouldn't give me money either,\" Guo Mingyi said softly.\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, \"That's all for now. I'll show you the transcript later. If you have no objections, please sign it.\"\n\nWith that, Lin Xiangbei stood up and walked out.\n\nAt this time, Shen Lingdong, with a heavy expression, also came out of the monitoring room.\n\nLin Xiangbei then said, \"Now, let's first find Ding Weilin's son and confirm whether he has a blood relationship with the victim before analyzing. After all this, we still haven't figured out who the victim is.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nNot long after, Ding Weilin's son, Ding Jian, was brought to the police station. Before he was taken to the interrogation room, hair samples were collected from him for testing.\n\nThe interrogation of Ding Jian went smoothly, and he quickly confessed. He admitted that he wanted his father to die quickly so he could get the inheritance. However, there was a discrepancy with Guo Mingyi's confession: the incident was not initiated by him, but Guo Mingyi gradually led him. He had been struggling for a long time, on one hand seeing his father suffer from illness, and on the other hand, driven by greed, he agreed to the foolish idea of killing by proxy.\n\nHe even presented chat records to prove that Guo Mingyi had indeed intentionally guided Ding Jian to do this.\n\nAfter the interrogation ended, the DNA match also came out. According to the report, he had a blood relationship with the victim, which meant the victim was indeed Ding Jian's father, Ding Weilin.\n\nHowever, why did the police determine the victim to be Lu Guisen?\n\nIn the office, Shen Lingdong and Lin Xiangbei reviewed the case. They later discovered that they had determined the victim's identity based on hair found in Lu Shitu's office, but this could be fabricated.\n\nHowever, the elderly resident went missing two months ago. From that time on, Ding Jian would no longer visit Ding Weilin at the nursing home. To frame someone, it must be done after Ding Weilin's death. There was no such opportunity at the nursing home. So, how did that person obtain Ding Jian's hair sample, and why did they do it?\n\nIf they only wanted to frame Ding Jian, there were many ways to do it, and there was no need to wait for a month to do it.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, then took a document from Lin Xiangbei's desk and began to read it. He then said slowly, \"The elderly residents' physical examinations are all handled by the nursing home. Do you think the nursing home might have been preparing for this day for a long time, all to help the director, suspect Lu Guisen, get away?\"\n\n\"But how did they determine who the deceased person was? And then use his information to replace the victim's information?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and said, \"That's why it took so long. This month might have been used by them to process various information replacements.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded slightly. He agreed more with Shen Lingdong's explanation. After pondering for a moment, he added a clue: \"From when we discovered Lu Guisen's body until now, Lu Shitu has not appeared. The victim was his own father, and he offered a reward of one million when he went missing. Now that the body has been found, why is he indifferent? He might know that the deceased is not his father. Also, his absence is probably to prevent us from obtaining DNA samples from him. If that were the case, we would know that the victim is not Lu Guisen.\"\n\n\"En,\" Shen Lingdong responded and continued along Lin Xiangbei's train of thought, \"I still have a question. With such a large nursing home, especially when it comes to the elderly, the protective measures should be very thorough. However, there are only a few surveillance cameras in the nursing home, and they do not cover everything comprehensively. Furthermore, since the establishment of the nursing home, there have been multiple cases of missing elderly residents. As the director, he should have been alerted. Instead, he turned a blind eye to this phenomenon, as if he had tacitly approved of this practice.\"\n\nAfter a slight pause, Shen Lingdong continued, \"There is also one more person involved, the girl who called me. We still haven't figured out who she is.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and said, \"Now, we have found the first crime scene and solved the case, but the clues have once again pointed to the underground parking lot of Lanhe Community. We still have to investigate again. It seems that everything has returned to square one.\"\n\nShen Lingdong reminded Lin Xiangbei, \"It's definitely not a coincidence that that person is pointing the final finger at Wu Yuhao. There must be more to it.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned, then took out a report and handed it to Shen Lingdong, saying, \"However, when we investigated all of Wu Yuhao's information, including his relatives and friends, no one had any connection to Xingfu Nursing Home.\"\n\nPoint.",

    "content": "沈令東低頭看著林向北遞來的報告，看了很長一段時間後，緩緩地開口說道：「如果單看這個案子，已經結案，但是根據我們掌握的線索來看，郭明義可能還犯有其他命案，如果屍體沒有被轉移，那麼這起命案到此也就結束了，如果郭明義表現良好，最多也就被判個死緩。但是因為屍體被轉移，讓這起案件無法結案，我們只有繼續調查下去，直到查清楚案發地點。」\n\n林向北點了點頭，說道：「我也正在為郭明義的事情發愁，如果只是判他一個死緩就太便宜他了。」\n\n「如果轉移屍體的那個人也是這麼想最好不過，只是害怕他有其他的想法。」沈令東略有些擔憂地說道。\n\n林向北隨後說道：「從目前的情況來看，我更傾向於後者，如果他是想要幫助我們對郭明義定罪，完全沒有必要搞得這麼麻煩，他可以直接向我們舉證。」\n\n沈令東皺了皺眉頭，隨後說道：「現在擔心的就是他手上也沒有證據，而是想要藉警方之手做些事情。」\n\n林向北沒有說話，而是來到了白板前，說道：「咱倆重新捋一下吧，就從屍體在地下倉庫消失開始。」\n\n從旁邊拿起一根馬克筆，隨後在白板上寫下了「地下倉庫」四個字，一邊寫一邊說道：「郭明義在殺害了丁偉林之後，便把屍體停放在地下倉庫，當時死者手上是沒有戴戒指的。但是，在這個時候，有人來到了地下倉庫，我們暫且稱呼他為嫌疑人B，他將屍體帶走，將陸貴森手上的戒指戴到了死者手指上，目的是為了偽造死者是陸貴森的假象。」\n\n「從這裡，我們就可以看出來，嫌疑人B是知道地下倉庫存在的，而且他也有鑰匙。」\n\n「第二點，他能從陸貴森手上拿到戒指，說明在之前的一段時間，他和陸貴森是在一起的，或者是見過面，所以這個嫌疑人B很有可能就是將其餘六位老人從幸福養老院帶走的那個嫌疑人。」\n\n「第三點，他能接觸到丁健，並且能夠從丁健身上取得毛髮樣本。」\n\n「第四，他能夠進入到陸識途的辦公室，把丁健的毛髮放到陸識途的椅子上。」\n\n「我感覺能夠符合這種條件的並不是很多，而且陸識途就是其中之一。」\n\n沈令東略微沉思片刻後微微搖了搖頭，隨後說道：「我們在案發現場發現了被燒焦的乾燥劑，我認為它並不是用來吸收水分的，很有可能是從嫌疑人B身上掉下來，所以我推測他的工作應該能夠接觸到乾燥劑這類東西。」\n\n林向北猶豫了一下，繼續說道：「我們繼續來捋。在1月2日，警方接到報案電話，隨即趕往藍河小區的地下停車庫。車輛外部已經燒焦，而且通過監控器可以分析出來，車輛的燃燒時間在當天十一點鐘左右。通過對車輛表面的調查，已經可以確定是白磷燃燒導致車輛燃燒。」\n\n「嫌疑人B可能是使用冰塊包裹著白磷，並且讓發動機引擎處於啟動狀態。發動機溫度過高，是冰塊融化，並且將水分蒸發，使白磷發生燃燒。但是無論採用何種方式，車輛都不會只燃燒片刻的功夫。」\n\n「車輛雖然剛剛燃燒，但是屍體確實一個月前就已經死亡的丁偉林，他的手上還戴著陸貴森的戒指。警方隨後調查到，燃燒的車輛是一輛改裝後的報廢車，五天前被人購買，但是屍體在車裡停留的時間，至少是在七天到十天之間。然而，在此期間，我們並沒有看到有嫌疑人出入，整個地下停車庫，當時只有保安一個人。」\n\n「這起案件中，總共涉及到兩個人，報案人鄭華，以及佔用了鄭華車位的吳宇豪。」\n\n在林向北說完後，便看著白板發呆，許久沒有說話。\n\n沈令東同樣也是沉默不語，他到現在也沒有想明白，兇手是如何讓一輛車輛，在內飾完好的情況下，只燃燒幾分鐘的時間。\n\n百思不得其解。\n\n許久後，沈令東站起身來，對著林向北說道：「今天就先到這裡吧，我先回去了。」\n\n林向北驚訝地看著沈令東，笑著說道：「這麼著急回去？倒不是你的性格……」\n\n「好睏。」\n\n林向北點了點頭，便讓沈令東回去了，今天他在養老院當了一天的志願者，巨大的體力勞動，現在還讓進行大量的腦力勞動，沒有人能撐得住。\n\n沈令東從刑警隊開車離開後，便直接返回家中，洗了個澡後，就躺在床上睡著了。\n\n第二天。\n\n早晨。\n\n沈令東醒來的第一件事情，就是看了一眼手機，發現沒有林向北的信息後，臉上的神情略微有些失落。\n\n沈令東看了看時間，才六點多鐘，他也並不著急從床上爬起來，而是望著天花板，將案件的信息從自己的腦海之中又過了一遍後，這才緩緩地爬起來。\n\n母親李香蘭正在廚房裡忙活著。\n\n隨即便站在門口，朝著廚房裡面望去，老媽正在熬粥，菜也只是一些鹹菜。\n\n沈令東隨即問道：「吃的這麼簡單？以前早飯不是挺豐盛的嗎？」\n\n「你又不在家，我自己隨便吃一口就行。」\n\n「一會給我也盛一點，今天我在家吃飯。」\n\n「你今天在家吃早飯？」李香蘭有些不敢相信地反問道。\n\n沈令東點了點頭，昨天一天沒吃飯，實在是有些餓了。\n\n李香蘭連忙說道：「那我在做一個菜。」\n\n一邊說著，一邊打開了另一個燃氣灶，兩個燃氣灶同時冒著火焰。\n\n「你想吃什麼？」李香蘭對著沈令東問道，見到沈令東正在發呆，隨即提高了一些音量，又重新問了一遍。\n\n此時，沈令東這才回過神來，對著老媽說道：「不用，我喝點粥就行。」\n\n「那不行，你現在得吃點好的補一補，自從你幹了這個清理組，吃飯也不定時了，房間也不收拾了，睡覺也還那麼晚，這麼下去，身體都熬壞了。」\n\n「你今天什麼安排？」沈令東隨即問道。\n\n「哦，我一會去看你爸去。」\n\n「哦。」沈令東輕輕應了一聲，看了一眼時間後，接著說道：「一會我送你到公交站吧，順便把那個日記本還給你。」\n\n李香蘭皺了皺眉頭，疑惑地看著沈令東，反問道：「你就不能直接把我送過去？」\n\n「一會我得去一趟公司，只能送你到公交站。」沈令東說道。\n\n「你這個沒良心的，我不給你做飯了，你愛吃什麼吃什麼？」\n\n李香蘭連忙將燃氣灶關閉了，隨後對著沈令東說道：「粥在鍋裡，自己盛。」\n\n沈令東點了點頭，隨後又看了一眼那個燃氣灶，隨後走進廚房拿出一個碗，隨後盛了一碗粥，回到飯桌上。\n\n在飯桌上，他也是沒什麼心情吃飯。\n\n剛剛看到母親打開燃氣灶，他想到有沒有那麼一個裝置，能夠讓車輛發生自燃，並且能夠隨時關閉？\n\n想想也覺得不太現實。\n\n即便是製作一個超大的「燃氣灶」，能夠將車輛點燃，但是又如何能夠保證關閉之後，車輛不會繼續燃燒？\n\n另外，處理這個「燃氣灶」也是一個問題。\n\n而且最重要的是，他們認為車輛發生燃燒，是看到了車輛燒焦的外殼，以及在反光鏡中看到光點。\n\n誰也沒有親眼看到車輛發生燃燒。\n\n略微猶豫片刻，沈令東連忙扒拉了幾口飯，放下碗筷，穿上外套，便向著外面走去。\n\n李香蘭在後面喊道：「怎麼走了？不是說送我到公交站嗎？」\n\n「媽，你自己走過去吧，多鍛煉鍛煉。」\n\n關上門，沈令東向著樓下走去，隨後開著車，向著樓下走去。\n\n半個小時後，拎著一個袋子的沈令東出現在了藍河小區的地下停車庫門口，因為這裡還是封鎖的狀態，和一名警察打過招呼後，沈令東從兜裡打開了記錄儀，挑起了封條，徑直走了進去。\n\n停車場內的環境還是比較昏暗的，沈令東打著手電筒向裡面走去，來到之前發現屍體的位置，看了一眼後，隨後從袋子中取出來一個鐵盆。\n\n又拿出一些布料、塑料等物品放到鐵盆之中，隨後拿出打火機將其點燃。\n\n在鐵盆裡面的東西燃燒了幾分鐘後，沈令東將其熄滅。\n\n隨後，向著停車場裡面走去，大概過了一分多鐘，才返回來，這段時間，他全程屏息。\n\n人類的肌肉是可以形成記憶的，視覺也會有殘留，味道同樣也是如此。\n\n如果長時間在氣味刺鼻的環境中停留，很快就會對這種氣味適應，以至於感覺上不會那麼刺鼻，就像是抽煙的人聞不到自己身上的煙味一樣。\n\n但對氣味的記憶，大概在三十秒左右。\n\n沈令東在此之前一直在聞著布料、塑料燃燒的味道，如果他在三十秒內返回到此地，對於氣味的記憶，會讓他分辨不出來有什麼特別的，也不會覺得刺鼻。\n\n但是時間超過三十秒後，對於之前那種刺鼻氣味的記憶減弱，也就感覺到其中的差別。\n\n當沈令東返回時，微微皺了皺鼻子，氣味很明顯。\n\n如果保安從裡面出來，路過那輛燃燒的車輛時，雖然眼睛沒有看到，但是鼻子也能聞到一些刺鼻的氣味。\n\n但是根據保安的口供，他沒有發現任何異常。\n\n要麼，保安在說謊；要麼，那輛車根本沒有燃燒，但是自己在另外一個監控攝像拍攝的視頻中，通過一輛車的反光鏡，發現了那輛車起火的事情，這很有可能就是偽造的。\n\n在視頻中，感受不到火焰的溫度，只能感受火焰的光亮，但是這種即便是沒有火焰也是可以人為製造的。\n\n沈令東此時抬起頭看了一眼牆上掛著的監控器。\n\n也真是巧，整個地下車庫，單單是這個監控器壞了。\n\n沈令東略微猶豫了一下，再次看了一眼監控器，大概判斷了一下它的拍攝範圍。\n\n忽然，沈令東發現了一個事情，就是真正屬於吳宇豪的那輛車也看上去像是在另外一個監控器的範圍內，但是其實那輛車也是在那個壞掉的監控器的監控範圍內。\n\n沈令東站在原地略微沉思片刻後，將地上的東西收拾乾淨之後，隨後便向著外面走去。\n\n回到公司，王繼中此時正在樓上，在網上調查著幸福養老院的信息。\n\n沈令東來到王繼中跟前，輕聲說道：「王哥，打火機借我一下。」\n\n「咋的，你要抽煙？」一邊說著，王繼中一邊掏出了自己的打火機。\n\n沈令東坐在沙發上，把自己兜裡的打火機又掏了出來，啪嗒啪嗒地按了起來。\n\n王繼中看著沈令東，隨後緩緩地開口說道：「你在這浪費我的打火機呢啊？」\n\n沈令東隨後對著王繼中說道：「吳宇豪在刑警隊的口供中說，他不止是那天沒有開車，從下第一場雪開始，他就沒有再開車，車一直停在車庫中。因為視頻保存時間的問題，那個時間段的監控並沒有保存。但是在1月2日，一輛與吳宇豪相同的車輛開進停車庫，隨後起火，當警方發現那輛車的時候，那輛車已經燒毀了。」\n\n「但是，我剛剛去那個停車庫做了測試，如果發生燃燒的話，會產生很濃烈的氣味，久久不散，保安如果返回到值班室的話，一定會察覺到，但是他沒有發現任何的異常。所以我有一個推測，就是裝著屍體的那輛車一直就在地下停車庫之中。而在1月2日早晨開進地下停車庫的那輛車，其實就是吳宇豪自己的車輛。」\n\n王繼中皺了皺眉頭，隨即問道：「雖然聽著有些不可思議，但在車中還有一具屍體，就算是很少有人回去查看，但是也是存在被發現的風險，兇手會冒著這樣的風險去做這樣的事情嗎？」\n\n沈令東隨即說道：「如果套上汽車外衣，就沒人能夠發現了，而且我剛剛發現地下停車庫裡面的那些車輛，也有一些也套上了汽車外衣，所以吳宇豪這麼做並不會引起懷疑。」\n\n王繼中猶豫了一下，問道：「不管怎麼樣，那輛報廢車一定是在停車場內被燒毀的，如果嫌疑人開著一輛燒毀的車進入到車庫，一定會被人注意到的。」",

    "content": "“Even if we drove it onto the road, the traffic police would stop us.”\n\nShen Lingdong said with a smile.\n\nHearing Shen Lingdong’s casual joke, Wang Jizhong’s spirits lifted. He quickly said, “If the suspect wanted to avoid spending too much time driving on the road, wouldn’t they have completed the vehicle renovation at a repair shop near their home? After all, every minute spent on the road increases the possibility of being discovered by the traffic police. In that case, we can start by investigating outwards from their home as the center.”\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly. Although he didn’t respond to Wang Jizhong, he stood up and walked towards the door.\n\nWang Jizhong understood Shen Lingdong’s thoughts; he seemed to be considering other possibilities but hadn’t come up with any leads yet, so they could only start the investigation with Wang Jizhong’s suggestion.\n\nAfter getting into the car, Shen Lingdong took out his phone and searched online for repair shops near Lanhe Residential Area.\n\nHe found one relatively close and drove to a repair shop called Hongyu.\n\nAfter a while, Shen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong arrived at the Hongyu Repair Shop. They parked the minivan inside. Wang Jizhong got out and said to a mechanic, “My car’s engine is making a strange noise. Can you take a look?”\n\nThe mechanic immediately opened the hood and began to diagnose the problem.\n\nTaking this opportunity, Wang Jizhong leaned in and asked the mechanic, “In your line of work, do you guys find out about anything that happens in the industry quickly?”\n\nThe mechanic nodded and said, “In this line of work, we find out about things that happen very quickly. There are no secrets.”\n\n“Have you guys heard of any scrapped cars being renovated?” Wang Jizhong asked.\n\nThe mechanic hesitated for a moment, then shook his head and said, “I really haven’t heard of that, but it’s not exactly big news. Although cars like that can’t be driven on the road, people mostly modify them for fun. But there’s no point in modifying a scrapped car, unless it’s a vintage car or a luxury car.”\n\n“It was just an ordinary Audi.”\n\n“What would be the point?” the mechanic asked incredulously.\n\nAt this point, the mechanic straightened up and said to Wang Jizhong, “Your car’s exhaust pipe has a problem. The floor mats, water pump, bearings, and belt are all a bit worn out and need to be replaced. That will be five thousand yuan. You can pick up the car tomorrow morning.”\n\n“Oh.” Wang Jizhong responded softly and then said to the mechanic, “Then I won’t repair it.”\n\nIn reality, the car only had a slight issue with the belt. The other parts had been replaced not long ago and couldn’t possibly be worn out. If they weren’t so greedy, Shen Lingdong would have let them fix it. He hadn’t expected them to be so exorbitant, asking for five thousand yuan upfront.\n\n“Wait a minute.” The mechanic called out to Wang Jizhong.\n\n“What is it?” Wang Jizhong turned around and asked.\n\n“I’ve already diagnosed the problem for you. You can’t just leave now! That’s not how business is done,” the mechanic said, shaking his wrench.\n\n“You have to repair it here today.”\n\n“That’s right,” the mechanic nodded.\n\nAt this moment, a few other mechanics also came over, holding tools in their hands.\n\nWang Jizhong and Shen Lingdong ignored them and walked straight towards the car, but they were blocked from the car doors by two other mechanics.\n\nShen Lingdong then said to the mechanic in charge, “If you continue like this, I’m going to call people.”\n\n“It won’t matter who you call.”\n\nShen Lingdong then took out his phone, opened his contacts, and said to the mechanic, “You can choose anyone from my contacts. Whoever you want me to call, I’ll call.”\n\n“I’m not afraid of you, even if you call them all.”\n\nShen Lingdong scrolled through his contacts, saying, “This one is from the Administration for Industry and Commerce, this one is from the Urban Construction Bureau, this one is from the Tax Bureau, this one is from the Public Security Bureau…”\n\nAt this point, Wang Jizhong chuckled and said, “That’s not good enough. Look at mine.”\n\nAs he spoke, he took out his phone, opened his contacts, and said, “This is the Director of the Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce, this is the Director of the Public Security Bureau, this is from the Public Security Department… and this is him.”\n\nWang Jizhong pointed to Shen Lingdong next to him.\n\nHearing the titles of these people, the mechanics were stunned and immediately asked, “Brother… what do you two do?”\n\n“We’re both ordinary citizens,” Wang Jizhong said with a smile.\n\n“Brother, your car doesn’t have a big problem. Why don’t I fix it for you for free?” the mechanic said, bowing and scraping.\n\n“No need. However, if you continue to do business like this, be prepared to close down. Also, could you help me find out which repair shop recently took on a job to renovate a scrapped Audi car in the past ten days or so?”\n\n“Certainly, brother.”\n\nShen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong turned around to get into the car. The two mechanics quickly opened the car doors and invited them in.\n\nAfter getting into the car, they immediately started the engine and drove away.\n\nAfter Shen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong left, the mechanics breathed a sigh of relief, fortunate that they hadn’t gotten into trouble with these “big shots.”\n\nShen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong then visited several other repair shops. The answers they received were basically the same as from the first mechanic; none of them had heard anything about this.\n\nOn the way back to the company, the two talked about the first repair shop. After a while, Old Wang said to Shen Lingdong, “Lingdong, I’m not questioning your taste, but the stickers on the car are really quite ugly. Although our company isn’t a chain company, we are quite well-known in Dongjiang City. It’s so embarrassing to drive around like this.”\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, “Indeed, we need to change them. I’ll peel them off when we get back and put new ones on.”\n\n“The adhesive residue is difficult to clean. Let’s find a professional to clean it.”\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly and said, “We are the professionals.”\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong took out his phone, wiped the screen, and said, “My phone screen is smudged. I can barely see it.”\n\nAs he spoke, he took out a tissue, blew on it, and wiped the screen.\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at it and then said, “I’ll give you one. Remember to put a screen protector on your phone in the future. Once you peel it off, the screen will still be good.”\n\nAfter saying this, Shen Lingdong paused slightly.\n\nThen he pulled the car over to the side of the road.\n\nWang Jizhong also looked at Shen Lingdong, as if he had thought of something.\n\nAfter looking at each other for a few seconds, Shen Lingdong spoke first, “Old Wang… do you think that car might have been burned originally, and they just put a layer of white car wrap on it? Once it entered the underground parking garage, they could just tear off the outer wrap.”\n\nWang Jizhong nodded and said, “That’s what I was thinking. But how can we make the car look like it just caught fire?”\n\n“Burn it again,” Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n“No… didn’t you say before that setting the car on fire in the garage wouldn’t work?”\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\n“It’s true that it wouldn’t work, but it’s possible to make the car burn for a few minutes without producing any unusual odors. For example, by spraying alcohol on the car’s body. However, if it’s a large amount of alcohol, it might flow into the car’s interior, which could be detected and potentially cause a fire inside the car. Perhaps solid fuel tablets could be used. Attaching solid fuel tablets all over the car’s exterior would allow control over the burning time based on the amount used.”\n\nWang Jizhong nodded thoughtfully.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then said to Wang Jizhong, “Let’s do a test when we get back. Let’s first test if this method is feasible.”\n\nWang Jizhong nodded again.\n\nAfter returning to the company, Shen Lingdong found a metal box in the warehouse and bought some solid fuel tablets. He then cut the solid fuel tablets into 5-millimeter thick pieces and evenly attached them to the small metal box.\n\nHe then lit it.\n\nAfter burning for a few minutes, the solid fuel tablets disappeared, leaving only the metal box.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said, “This method is indeed feasible. Even if the car started, the temperature wouldn’t melt the solid fuel tablets, so the killer likely used this method.”\n\n“Next, we just need to solve the problem of the desiccant, and we might find the suspect.”\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then said, “From the beginning, the killer has been trying to lead our attention to the nursing home. Now that we’ve found the killer, it’s someone from the nursing home. The suspect in the parking lot might know who the killer is, so he could have had contact with the actual killer, Guo Mingyi, who murdered Ding Weilin.”\n\nJust then, Yuan Yuan came out from outside and saw Shen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong gathered around a metal box.\n\n“What are you guys doing?” Yuan Yuan asked with a smile.\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at Yuan Yuan and then asked, “Where did you go? You didn’t close the door when you went out…”\n\n“I just went to the supermarket next door.” Yuan Yuan held up the bag in her hand and then continued to ask, “Do you guys want some?”\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head.\n\nWang Jizhong took a look and then said, “It’s all sweets. I can’t handle it…”\n\nYuan Yuan returned to her seat and smiled, saying, “The brain needs sugar to think, especially for someone like me who does mental labor. Eating more sweets helps me do my job well.”\n\nShen Lingdong snorted disdainfully and said, “Are you even doing the company’s work? I’m almost embarrassed to expose you.”\n\n“You can fire her,” Wang Jizhong said with a laugh from the side.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded in agreement.\n\nAt this moment, Yuan Yuan looked at Shen Lingdong and then slowly said, “I might really resign.”\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback.\n\nWang Jizhong quickly explained, “Don’t! I was just joking.”\n\n“No, I plan to become a full-time author next month, so after this month, I’ll be preparing to resign.”\n\n“Oh.” Shen Lingdong responded softly and continued, “That’s good. All good things must come to an end. If you have a better opportunity, we naturally support it. But when can I see your novel?”\n\n“Probably soon,” Yuan Yuan said with a smile.\n\nAt this moment, Yuan Yuan opened a bag of snacks and began to eat.\n\nBefore long, she took out a packet of desiccant from the snack bag, tore open the outer packaging, looked inside, and casually threw it into the trash can.\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n“When I was little, I often played with desiccant. It had little beads inside. If you put it in water, it would pop and crackle. But desiccant doesn’t seem to be like that anymore. I rarely encounter desiccant like that. I’ve eaten so many snacks, and I’ve only encountered it once.”\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then asked, “What kind of snack had it in it?”\n\n“I think it was beef jerky. I forgot which brand, but that beef jerky was delicious. I often gave that brand of beef jerky as a gift.”\n\n“Don’t play with it anymore in the future. If it’s in a small space and the amount of desiccant is large, it can explode,” Shen Lingdong warned Yuan Yuan.\n\nJust then, Shen Lingdong suddenly thought of Wu Yuhao’s hands and realized that it might not have been a burn, but a scald from the desiccant releasing heat when it came into contact with water.\n\nWith this thought, Shen Lingdong abruptly stood up and hurried out, driving to the Criminal Investigation Brigade.\n\nAlong the way, Shen Lingdong organized his thoughts.\n\nHe increasingly felt that Wu Yuhao had a high possibility of committing the crime.\n\nUpon arriving at the Criminal Investigation Brigade, Shen Lingdong found Lin Xiangbei and told him about what he had just realized.\n\nLin Xiangbei hesitated slightly. Although he couldn’t figure out Wu Yuhao’s motive, he did seem suspicious.\n\nTherefore, he immediately ordered someone to bring Wu Yuhao back to the police station.\n\nBefore long, Wu Yuhao was brought back to the police station, and Lin Xiangbei interrogated him again. Meanwhile, the police also searched Wu Yuhao’s home. Finally, in a corner of his dining room wall, they found desiccant identical to that found at the crime scene.\n\nThey also found unused solid fuel tablets in his home.\n\nAfter Lin Xiangbei reconstructed the entire case, Wu Yuhao admitted that he was responsible for everything that happened in the parking lot, and the process of the crime was exactly as Lin Xiangbei had described.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at Wu Yuhao and then asked, “Why did you do this?”\n\n“I didn’t have any particular thoughts,” Wu Yuhao said expressionlessly. “I knew he was the killer, but I didn’t have any evidence.”\n\nLin Xiangbei frowned and then continued, “Have you been to the Happiness Nursing Home recently?”\n\n“No.”\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded slightly and then said, “How did you know the password for the underground warehouse’s combination lock?”\n\nWu Yuhao hesitated for a moment and then slowly said, “I secretly followed him and saw the password.”\n\n“Oh.” Lin Xiangbei responded softly and then asked, “Who instructed you to do this?”\n\nWu Yuhao was slightly taken aback and quickly said, “No one. I just wanted to do it myself.”\n\nHearing this in the surveillance room, Shen Lingdong immediately walked out, drove back to Lanhe Residential Area, and quickly found Wu Yuhao’s home.\n\nPolice were still present, wrapping up the scene.\n\nIn the room, a mother and son sat on the sofa. A little boy leaned against his mother, sobbing occasionally.\n\nShen Lingdong put on shoe covers and entered the room, looking at the little boy.\n\nThe little boy also looked up at Shen Lingdong and asked, “Uncle, what happened to my dad?”\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the little boy, perhaps seeing his past self. He then bent down, patted the little boy’s head, and said, “Your dad is a hero. There was a favor your dad needed to help me complete. Would you like to help Uncle with a favor too?”\n\n“Really? Is my dad really a hero?”\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, “Of course. In my eyes, your father is a hero. He did a very great thing.”\n\nHearing Shen Lingdong say this, the little boy’s mood improved significantly, and he stopped crying.\n\nShen Lingdong patted the little boy’s head again and asked, “Do you have any beef jerky at home?”",

On it were several bags of unopened beef jerky, with some individually packaged items scattered nearby.\n\nShen Lingdong quickly stepped forward to take a look. He then took out a strip of jerky and, returning to the boy, softly asked, \"Can you give me one, Uncle?\"\n\nThe little boy nodded immediately.\n\nShen Lingdong then took out his phone and asked the boy, \"Do you know this young lady?\"\n\n\"Sister Xiao Yuan!\" the boy exclaimed excitedly, pointing at the photo on the phone.\n\nShen Lingdong then asked, \"How do you know Sister Xiao Yuan?\"\n\n\"She saved my life,\" the boy replied.\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at the boy's mother and asked, \"What happened?\"\n\nThe boy's mother looked at Shen Lingdong and then softly said, \"Three years ago, I took Longlong to play in a nearby park. There were a few other children playing there too. I was chatting with some of the other mothers, and before long, I heard the other children shouting. We mothers felt something was wrong and rushed over to check. A child was struggling in the water.\"\n\n\"I couldn't see my Longlong among the children, so I knew it was likely him who fell in. I panicked immediately and didn't know what to do. Just then, a girl jumped into the water and rescued Longlong.\"\n\n\"After they got ashore, Longlong lay on the ground motionless, his face was purple, and he didn't even have a pulse. That girl, Yuan Yuan, immediately performed CPR on Longlong. I don't know how long it took, but Longlong woke up, and the 120 ambulance arrived. Because the rescue was so timely, Longlong was fine by the time he reached the hospital.\"\n\n\"Later, Yuan Yuan often came to visit Longlong. Every time she came, she brought a pile of gifts, and that beef jerky was also brought by her. Longlong is a bit mischievous. While we weren't paying attention, he took out the desiccant inside, put it in a bottle, and was about to add water. Fortunately, Longlong's dad discovered him in time and snatched it away. But just as he grabbed it, there was a 'bang,' and the desiccant sprayed out, scalding Longlong's dad's arm.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and then said to Longlong, \"You can't do such dangerous things in the future, okay?\"\n\nLonglong obediently nodded.\n\nShen Lingdong then stood up, glanced at the time, and quickly ran downstairs.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong returned to the company, Wang Jizhong was holding his phone, pestering Yuan Yuan to teach him how to play \"scripted murder\"<sup>1</sup>.\n\nSeeing Shen Lingdong return, Yuan Yuan immediately complained, \"Shen Lingdong, you have to pay me overtime. It's been half an hour since we got off work, and Old Wang won't let me leave, making me teach him 'scripted murder'.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then gently placed the beef jerky he got from Longlong's house on Yuan Yuan's desk and said, \"Here's a reward of beef jerky. It should be the kind you mentioned.\"\n\nYuan Yuan was slightly stunned, slowly picked up the beef jerky from the desk, and then softly asked, \"Where did you find it?\"\n\n\"Wu Yuhao's place,\" Shen Lingdong replied softly.\n\nYuan Yuan looked up at Shen Lingdong slightly, then slowly said, \"This matter has nothing to do with them. I planned it myself. I used Wu Yuhao.\"\n\nWang Jizhong, standing nearby, slowly put away his phone and looked at Yuan Yuan and Shen Lingdong expressionlessly.\n\nYuan Yuan continued, \"Since you found Wu Yuhao's place, you should know about Longlong. I have a younger brother about Longlong's age, but he passed away when he was very young. I feel Longlong is very much like my younger brother, so I often went to see him. Over time, we became familiar. Sometimes when his parents were busy, I would pick Longlong up from school and take him to my place first, and then his parents would come to pick him up from my place after work.\"\n\n\"As for Guo Mingyi... he was my father's workmate. They were working in the underground warehouse of Xingfu Nursing Home back then. Later, because the boss got into trouble, the workers' wages couldn't be paid, and the boss owed the workers nearly 100,000 yuan in wages. Finally, my father took the lead and filed a lawsuit, and eventually got that 100,000 yuan in wages back. My father was temporarily in charge of that money, preparing to distribute it uniformly.\"\n\n\"However, after that, I never saw my father again. They said my father ran away with the money. At that time, my father and my brother were together. Those workers demanded that our family repay the money, and my mother had no choice but to sell the house to repay that money. Although my mother and I always suspected that my father and brother were murdered, there was no evidence. Until last time, when I was cleaning at Xingfu Nursing Home, I saw a fountain pen on Guo Mingyi that my father always carried with him. That fountain pen was a gift I gave to my father on his birthday.\"\n\n\"That's when I suspected Guo Mingyi killed my father and brother back then, so I came up with this method.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly and then asked, \"Why didn't you tell me directly? By doing this... you not only implicated yourself but also Wu Yuhao's family.\"\n\nYuan Yuan's eyes were red. She shook her head slightly and said, \"I didn't intend to involve Brother Wu Yuhao. It was just that one time when Longlong was at my place, he took a notebook of mine. That notebook contained the plan for this case. Longlong didn't notice it, but Brother Wu discovered it. Later, he found me and said he wanted to help me. However, he stole the copied key I had and took Ding Weilin's key.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then asked, \"How did you get the key?\"\n\n\"Later, after I realized Guo Mingyi might be the real killer of my father, I remembered an incoherent old man. I impersonated his family member, which allowed me to enter the nursing home. While Guo Mingyi was away, I copied his key. The medical records in the fake archive room and the hair samples in Lu Shitu's room were also placed by me. It was also easy to get Ding Jian's hair sample; I just needed to get close to him.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" Shen Lingdong asked again.\n\nYuan Yuan hesitated slightly, then said, \"I heard you talking about the film crew. This case is my resume.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly.\n\nYuan Yuan then said, \"My mother suffered hardships she shouldn't have. I want her to have a good life. As long as I'm not caught this time, I can join the film crew and earn a lot of money.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then asked, \"Who were you contacting?\"\n\nYuan Yuan immediately took out her phone, scrolled through her WeChat contacts, and found someone. That person was Lu Guisen, who had been missing.\n\nYuan Yuan opened the chat history. Their chat records started from October, which was when Yuan Yuan added Lu Guisen on WeChat. Their conversations had been continuous since then.\n\nShen Lingdong still had Lu Guisen's WeChat on his phone, which Yuan Yuan had shared with him.\n\nShen Lingdong sighed softly and then slowly said, \"Don't do things like this anymore.\"\n\nYuan Yuan then said, \"I hope you find the truth about my father and clear his name. I also hope you make this cleaning company bigger and stronger. When I get out, if I can't find a job, I hope you'll take me in.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed softly, then said to Yuan Yuan, \"Let's go, I'll take you.\"\n\n\"I'm going too,\" Wang Jizhong said softly.\n\nAfterward, Shen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong escorted Yuan Yuan to the criminal police team.\n\nYuan Yuan confessed everything to the police.\n\nShen Lingdong and Wang Jizhong sat in the lounge, sighing.\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei rushed past the lounge door. Shen Lingdong quickly went up to her and asked, \"Why haven't you finished work yet?\"\n\nGu Caiwei looked back at Shen Lingdong and then said, \"Aren't I still working with the families of those victims? I'm busy now. We'll talk after I get off work.\"\n\nShen Lingdong returned to the lounge, back to Wang Jizhong's side, and then asked, \"Did you see that Yuan Yuan was suspicious, so you deliberately kept her from going home?\"\n\nWang Jizhong sighed and then said, \"She always gives gifts but doesn't know the names of the people. Doesn't that sentence sound odd to you?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then recalled it. It did sound odd now. He then slowly said, \"I didn't notice. My attention was on the desiccant at the time.\"\n\nWang Jizhong then stood up and said to Shen Lingdong, \"You can wait here slowly. I won't accompany you. I just asked, and for someone like Yuan Yuan, who didn't directly participate in the murder and surrendered herself, the problem shouldn't be too big. You don't need to worry. If she's lucky, she might not even have to go to jail. Even if she does, it'll only be for a year or two.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and then said, \"Yuan Yuan seemed to have known this outcome already, which is why she said she would resign next month to become a full-time author. Perhaps she plans to write novels in prison.\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded and then said, \"If it's just writing novels, that's fine. I'm just afraid it might be something else, like scripts... Alright, I'm leaving.\"\n\nAfter Wang Jizhong left, Shen Lingdong went to the monitoring room to check the interrogation.\n\nYuan Yuan had already confessed everything. She and Wu Yuhao had been detained. Only Guo Mingyi remained in the interrogation room.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Guo Mingyi. It seemed he was determined to hold out to the end, trying to buy himself a chance to survive.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked at Shen Lingdong and asked, \"Any ideas?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shrugged; he was also helpless.\n\nAfter a long while, Gu Caiwei suddenly burst into the monitoring room and said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Captain Lin, he confessed. One of the victims' families confessed.\"\n\nShen Lingdong and Lin Xiangbei were both startled.\n\nGu Caiwei quickly handed the written confession to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nOne of the victims' family members admitted to colluding with Guo Mingyi to murder his own father. They were brothers, and the deceased had decided to leave all the inheritance to the second son, meaning he would get nothing.\n\nIn a fit of anger, he agreed to Guo Mingyi's proposal to murder his father.\n\nHowever, over the years, his conscience had been tormented, and he deeply regretted his actions. Finally, he told the truth.\n\nAt this point, Gu Caiwei continued, \"The situations of the others are also similar. After all, conspiring to murder one's parents is such a heinous act, and they are all feeling guilty. As long as we continue to persuade them, they will all confess truthfully.\"\n\n\"You've made a great contribution this time. Hurry up and go!\" Lin Xiangbei urged.\n\nShen Lingdong sighed softly and then said, \"Even if he confesses everything, he probably won't admit to one murder.\"\n\n\"Yuan Yuan's father's case.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nAs he spoke, Shen Lingdong walked out.\n\nReturning to the lounge, he pondered how to get Guo Mingyi to confess to the crimes committed against Yuan Yuan's father and son, while waiting for Gu Caiwei to finish work.\n\nIt wasn't until two in the morning that Gu Caiwei's tired figure appeared in the lounge. She glanced at Shen Lingdong and then asked, \"You're still here.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"Aren't I waiting for you?\"\n\n\"Waiting for me? Hearing you say that, I feel energized again.\"\n\nShen Lingdong stood up and said to Gu Caiwei, \"Let's go, I'll take you home.\"\n\nAfter getting into the car, Gu Caiwei was too tired to speak and was scrolling through short videos on her own. Shen Lingdong didn't bother her and drove the car.\n\nSuddenly, Gu Caiwei exclaimed, \"The livestream you guys did at that park last time went viral. Many people were sad that the park would no longer be accessible.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"The land beneath our feet might have had bodies buried in ancient times.\"\n\nGu Caiwei continued, \"Many people are tagging your Sunshine Cleaning, asking your Special Scene Cleanup team to clean it up.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback and then asked, \"There was a murder in the woods, but it's been so many years, and there's no trace left. What am I supposed to clean... If anything, it's the underground warehouse that needs cleaning.\"\n\n\"They want you to clean the underground warehouse.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was surprised and immediately asked, \"How did they find out about the underground warehouse?\"\n\n\"Who knows. Captain Lin specifically instructed us not to publicize this matter.\"\n\n\"These netizens are too powerful,\" Shen Lingdong sighed, then said to Gu Caiwei, \"As long as they're willing to pay, I'll go clean it. However, they need to register it with the police station first. I don't have the authority to take on this kind of job.\"\n\nGu Caiwei smiled slightly and then said, \"I have the authority. I'll reply to them then.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nAfter dropping Gu Caiwei home, Shen Lingdong also went home.\n\nThe next morning, Shen Lingdong received a call from Gu Caiwei. Gu Caiwei informed Shen Lingdong that someone had indeed registered with the police, asking Shen Lingdong's Special Scene Cleanup team to clean the park and the underground warehouse.\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> \"Scripted murder\" (剧本杀 - jùběn shā) is a popular social deduction game in China where players take on roles in a murder mystery and solve it by finding clues and interrogating each other.",

    "content": "Special Site Cleanup Technician\n\nAfter receiving information from Gu Caiwei, Shen Lingdong got up, drove to the company, collected his equipment, and then headed to the underground warehouse with Wang Jizhong, Zheng Daoguang, and Xu Tao.\n\nNine o'clock.\n\nShen Lingdong and his group appeared at the underground warehouse.\n\nBesides Gu Caiwei and a few police officers, there were also many onlookers at the scene. Everyone had learned about the incident online and came to watch. Some young people even offered to help.\n\nPeople were not repulsed by the matter and even offered Shen Lingdong a lot of encouragement.\n\nFrom this situation, it seemed that people were no longer very resistant to this profession. Although the older generation still cared about it, the acceptance level among young people was quite high. Some even thought it was a cool thing.\n\nShen Lingdong was grateful for everyone's support, but their offers of help were politely declined.\n\nFirst, there were relevant regulations that prevented them from easily participating. Second, if so many people were involved, he would need to provide protective suits, which would be a considerable expense.\n\nUpon entering the underground warehouse, they didn't start work immediately. They were waiting for Xu Tao to arrive with the water truck.\n\nLarge amounts of clean water were needed for the cleanup process. Since there were no rivers nearby, they had to use a water truck to fetch water from a distance. Fortunately, the Happy Nursing Home provided a water truck and allowed them to draw water from there.\n\nNot long after, Xu Tao arrived at the underground warehouse with the water truck. After connecting the hoses, the cleanup work could officially begin.\n\nThe main challenge at this point was the moldy walls and floor in the cold, damp underground warehouse.\n\nWhen this underground warehouse was nearing completion, the walls were cement, already blackened in some areas. There were also some construction materials like bricks and cement piled inside.\n\nOld Wang and Zheng Daoguang, being elderly, could not do strenuous physical labor and could only perform simple cleaning tasks. The high-intensity physical work was left to Shen Lingdong and Xu Tao.\n\nWang Jizhong used a high-pressure washer to clean the ceiling, while the others began clearing the garbage from the floor. They first moved the beds out of the room. To avoid making the people outside uncomfortable, the beds had been covered with black garbage bags. At that time, the drainage system for the underground warehouse had not been built, so all the sewage had to be cleared manually.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, it was noon, and the cleanup work was more than half completed. The originally dark front of the warehouse revealed its original cement color.\n\nJust as they were about to take a break, Wang Jizhong looked at his cleaning work with satisfaction.\n\nAt that moment, Wang Jizhong suddenly moved closer to the wall and observed it carefully.\n\nAlthough the walls were all cement gray, in one particular spot, he could see that the wall color was slightly different. Upon closer inspection, he noticed a clear seam.\n\nWang Jizhong quickly called Shen Lingdong over, \"Lingdong, come and take a look...\"\n\nShen Lingdong hurried over and examined the wall carefully. He then said to Wang Jizhong, \"This section seems to have been repaired. Judging by its size, an adult could fit inside...\"\n\n\"Could it be?\" Wang Jizhong looked at Shen Lingdong with suspicion.\n\nShen Lingdong then took out his phone and called Lin Xiangbei, informing him of their discovery.\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Shen Lingdong notified Gu Caiwei of the situation. Gu Caiwei immediately ordered the scene to be sealed off.\n\nThe onlookers outside were curious about what had happened inside. Some speculated that something important might have been discovered, otherwise, the scene wouldn't have been sealed off.\n\nAbout half an hour later.\n\nLin Xiangbei and his team appeared at the scene and began excavating. After carefully breaking open the wall, soil was revealed. The police painstakingly removed the soil.\n\nAfter digging for some time, a police officer suddenly exclaimed, \"Found something.\"\n\nEveryone gathered around. In the soil, a bone was exposed – a finger bone of an adult.\n\nAs the excavation deepened, a complete adult skeleton was revealed. The police carefully retrieved the skeleton. It was wearing a largely decayed piece of clothing. Lin Xiangbei instructed them to continue digging deeper.\n\nNot long after, another child's skeleton was unearthed.\n\nShen Lingdong then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"These should be the skeletal remains of Yuan Yuan's father and brother, right?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and said, \"Most likely, but we'll need to do a DNA match back at the station.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Shen Lingdong replied.\n\nLin Xiangbei looked around and then said, \"Let's stop here for today. Pack up the equipment.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the ground, then bent down to examine the male skeleton. He then said to Lin Xiangbei, \"Can I stay a bit longer?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei nodded and said, \"You and Brother Wang can see if you can find any other evidence. I'll take the bodies back first.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then went to the side of the opening, taking a small shovel and brush to examine the dug-up soil. He had just noticed a slight crack on the man's right hand fingers, which appeared to be a fracture mark. Additionally, there were signs of fractures on the skull and shoulder bones.\n\nIt seemed he had fought with someone before death.\n\nHe wanted to find some information about the killer, but the bodies had been buried in the soil for many years. Even if there was any evidence, it would likely have vanished without a trace.\n\nLooking at the soil on the ground, Shen Lingdong fell into deep thought.\n\nAt that time, Guo Mingyi had accompanied Yuan Yuan's father, Yuan Shan, to collect money, and Yuan Shan had brought his younger son with him.\n\nIf Guo Mingyi wanted to act, he would have had to choose a very safe place where neither of them could escape.\n\nBecause if Guo Mingyi attacked Yuan Shan, the younger son would be frightened and run away.\n\nHowever, if Guo Mingyi attacked the younger son, Yuan Shan would not leave but would fight back, so the injuries on his body might have been sustained then.\n\nWhat if...\n\nCould this underground warehouse be the primary scene of Yuan Shan's murder? After killing Yuan Shan, Guo Mingyi directly used tools from the scene to bury Yuan Shan and his son in the wall.\n\nBut would Yuan Shan bring his young son to such a place?\n\nShen Lingdong looked around. Even if Yuan Shan's younger son was curious and wanted to enter, the place was filled with miscellaneous items at the time. Yuan Shan would definitely not let his young son in. Therefore, Guo Mingyi must have killed Yuan Shan and his son elsewhere and transported the bodies to this location.\n\nHowever, there was another problem.\n\nGuo Mingyi was just an ordinary worker at the time and had no money to buy a car. How did he transport the bodies?\n\nWould there be any evidence on the transport vehicle?\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong noticed a handcart stacked on the other side. However, the handcart was not very large and couldn't fit an adult.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Shen Lingdong approached the stack of handcarts. If Guo Mingyi used a handcart to transport the bodies, then the murder scene should not be far from this underground warehouse.\n\nBased on the situation at the time, the most likely location was the vegetable market under construction next door.\n\nYuan Shan wanted to return the wages owed by the boss to the workers. He would choose the best location, of course, a well-known location. The underground warehouse had dim lighting, so the unfinished vegetable market would be the best choice.\n\nBecause Yuan Shan's wages included those of the workers building the vegetable market.\n\nTherefore, that was the best choice.\n\nRight, there was still one piece of evidence missing: Yuan Shan's mobile phone. Yuan Shan had used his phone to send a message to Yuan Yuan's mother, saying that he was taking his younger son away from here.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly. If Yuan Yuan and her mother discovered that Yuan Shan was dead, it would be easy to trace the matter back to Guo Mingyi. The best approach would be to make them believe that the two of them were still alive.\n\nThe best way to create this illusion was to keep his phone.\n\nTherefore, Yuan Shan's phone could be found at Guo Mingyi's home or at the nursing home.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately sent this idea to Lin Xiangbei.\n\nAfterward, Shen Lingdong bent down to inspect the handcart and casually touched its handle.\n\nIt was a hollow tube.\n\nSuddenly, Shen Lingdong frowned slightly. He then bent down to examine the hollow tube. He seemed to have touched something. After fumbling for a while, he pulled out a plastic wrapper, a popsicle wrapper, which also contained a wooden stick.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then examined another hollow tube.\n\nHe seemed to have touched something. Shen Lingdong picked up his phone and carefully extracted the item from inside. It was a white gauze, seemingly with some bloodstains on it. Shen Lingdong then called two police officers, handed them the white gauze, and asked the police to search the handcart.\n\nIf the bloodstains on the gauze belonged to Guo Mingyi, then he would likely know how Guo Mingyi killed Yuan Shan.\n\nAfter the police finished collecting evidence, Shen Lingdong accompanied them back to the police station. While the police were testing the collected evidence, Shen Lingdong, carrying photos of the two skeletons found at the scene, found Yuan Yuan.\n\nUpon seeing Shen Lingdong, Yuan Yuan asked, \"Any leads?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and said, \"You need to be prepared. We just found two skeletons in the underground warehouse, one adult and one child.\"\n\nYuan Yuan suddenly froze, her eyes turning red.\n\nShen Lingdong then placed two photos in front of Yuan Yuan and asked, \"Do you recognize these two sets of clothes?\"\n\nUpon seeing the photos, Yuan Yuan covered her mouth and started crying.\n\nAfter a long while, she slowly said, \"It's my dad and my brother...\"\n\nShen Lingdong then slowly said, \"We also found some evidence at the scene that should prove Guo Mingyi is the killer of your father and brother.\"\n\n\"How did he do it?\" Yuan Yuan asked.\n\n\"The report isn't out yet, and what I'm saying is just my speculation. At that time, your father, Yuan Shan, brought your brother to the site of the vegetable market that is currently under construction. Yuan Shan planned to return the money he had collected to the workers there. Just as your father was about to notify the workers, Guo Mingyi tried to hold your brother hostage. Your father resisted fiercely but was no match for Guo Mingyi and was injured. Your brother was also injured or killed by Guo Mingyi. However, based on my speculation, it's more likely he was injured. If he had been killed directly, your father might have fought to the death.\"\n\n\"Guo Mingyi threatened your father to put his injured brother into a handcart and push him to the underground parking garage. There, Guo Mingyi killed both father and son and took Yuan Shan's phone from his hand, sending messages to you and your mother, saying he was taking his younger son away. However, during the earlier struggle, your father might have inadvertently pulled off the gauze that Guo Mingyi had wrapped around his hand earlier and stuffed it into the hollow tube of the handcart.\"\n\n\"Later, Guo Mingyi dug up the front and buried the bodies of the father and son, then sealed it with cement again. After so many years, due to the mold, no traces could be seen from the outside. It wasn't until today that we cleaned the underground warehouse.\"\n\n\"If the police can prove that the bloodstains on the gauze belong to Guo Mingyi, it will prove that Guo Mingyi killed Yuan Shan and his son.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Yuan Yuan covered her face and wept. After a long while, she slowly looked up at Shen Lingdong and said, \"Thank you. If I had told you about this earlier, would things be different?\"\n\nShen Lingdong's expression was blank as he slowly said, \"I'm helping you out of consideration for our long history of working together. However, I've started to suspect you. Was it you who called me to clean up the Happy Nursing Home?\"\n\n\"It was me...\"\n\n\"The reason you asked me to go there wasn't to discover a murder case or to clean up traces, but because you wanted to sneak in and dispose of something. Furthermore, your chat logs with the director did not mention the ring that Lu Guisen was wearing. If you are the mastermind, how did you obtain the ring? Also, you once mentioned that the 99.99999% burnt body was not the person himself. That was also information you leaked to me beforehand. Although I don't have any clues on these matters yet, I will continue to investigate.\"\n\nYuan Yuan shook her head slightly and said, \"The burnt body was a coincidence. Novelists do use that kind of trope. As for the ring, it was a package I received. I had seen this package on Lu Guisen before. Also, it was indeed me who called, but I also wanted you to discover what happened at the Happy Nursing Home.\"\n\n\"I sincerely hope you have no connection to the film crew, but I will continue to investigate any suspicious aspects until the truth is revealed.\"\n\nYuan Yuan lowered her head and sighed softly. Then she said, \"I've said what I needed to say. If that's how you think, there's nothing I can do. Feel free to investigate, but I still want to thank you for helping me find the truth about my father's murder.\"",

    "content": "After Shen Lingdong was released from the detention center, he returned to the Criminal Investigation Team's lounge.\n\nAfter waiting for a while, the police's inspection report came out. The bloodstains extracted from the white gauze were indeed Guo Mingyi's. The bloodstains extracted from the handcart contained the blood of Yuan Shan's younger son.\n\nFurthermore, Yuan Shan's phone card was found in Guo Mingyi's home.\n\nFaced with the evidence, Guo Mingyi finally realized that all his crimes had been exposed and finally confessed everything.\n\nIn June 2012.\n\nGuo Mingyi and Yuan Shan were both workers at an underground warehouse construction site. At that time, the boss, to create a hidden underground warehouse, did not make a big fuss.\n\nThey excavated from above and then covered it up.\n\nInstead, they directly used underground excavation, similar to how the subway is built.\n\nWith the conditions at the time, their progress was very slow, but dealing with so much was not an easy task. Fortunately, the nearby vegetable market needed a large amount of backfill soil, and the soil they excavated could be directly transported to the vegetable market.\n\nNot long after, the supervisor told them that the boss had an accident.\n\nThe workers immediately panicked.\n\nFortunately, Yuan Shan, who was somewhat educated, was there. Yuan Shan led them to sue and recover their deserved wages.\n\nBy the time they received the money, it was already August.\n\nTo gather everyone, Yuan Shan chose the vegetable market as the meeting place, as everyone knew it.\n\nWhen Guo Mingyi saw Yuan Shan withdraw over a hundred thousand yuan, he desperately wanted to keep the money for himself. Seeing that no one was around, Guo Mingyi developed a murderous intent. However, Yuan Shan's younger son was also present. He first threatened Yuan Shan with his younger son, demanding the money.\n\nBut Yuan Shan kept persuading Guo Mingyi, saying that the money was the hard-earned money of their fellow workers.\n\nGuo Mingyi, enraged, knocked out Yuan Shan's younger son.\n\nAt this moment, seeing his son knocked out, Yuan Shan rushed forward. Guo Mingyi was holding an iron rod, and Yuan Shan was holding a brick. After a fight, Guo Mingyi gained the upper hand, snatched the bag containing the money, and threatened Yuan Shan with a shovel.\n\nYuan Shan was already injured in multiple places and kept begging for mercy, saying he could die and admit to absconding with the money, as long as Guo Mingyi would spare his younger son.\n\nGuo Mingyi knew that if anyone left alive, his actions would be exposed, so he decided to deal with them all.\n\nHe had Yuan Shan put his younger son into a handcart and push him to the underground warehouse next to the vegetable market. There, he knocked Yuan Shan unconscious with a shovel, then dug open the wall and buried them both. Finally, he used the cement from the construction site to repair the opening.\n\nAfterward, he used Yuan Shan's phone to send a message to Yuan Shan's wife and kept the phone card. In addition, he took Yuan Shan's pen and ID card.\n\nWhen the other workers arrived at the vegetable market, Guo Mingyi incited a disturbance, saying that Yuan Shan had absconded with the money.\n\nFor this reason, Guo Mingyi even used Yuan Shan's ID card to buy a train ticket.\n\nLater, he also used Yuan Shan's phone number to create a WeChat account and frequently posted updates, making Yuan Yuan and her mother believe that Yuan Shan was still alive.\n\nAfter listening to Guo Mingyi's confession, Lin Xiangbei was furious and slammed the table, saying to Guo Mingyi, \"For ten thousand yuan, you didn't even spare a child. Are you even human?\"\n\nGuo Mingyi smiled faintly and said, \"What's so good about being human... If I had a choice, I'd rather be a dog...\"\n\nLin Xiangbei was momentarily speechless.\n\nAfter a long pause, he said to the policeman next to him, \"Take him down first.\"\n\nAfterward, Lin Xiangbei also left the interrogation room. As he passed by the lounge, he saw Shen Lingdong inside and walked in, sighing and sitting down opposite Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"This Guo Mingyi is simply inhuman. How could someone like him work as a caregiver for so many years? It's unbelievable!\"\n\n\"His purpose for working as a caregiver was not pure to begin with.\"\n\n\"It's a shame we couldn't get any information about the film crew from him. He doesn't seem to be involved in this matter.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then asked, \"Did he have any involvement in gambling before?\"\n\nLin Xiangbei shook his head.\n\n\"Any other vices?\" Shen Lingdong continued to ask.\n\n\"No. I investigated his bank account statements for the past three years. Only his salary was deposited each month. The salary wasn't very high. Most of that money was spent at the supermarket across the street. There were no savings.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and slowly said, \"Then why did he need so much money? And his life didn't seem to improve after getting that money.\"\n\nLin Xiangbei sighed and said, \"It's been too long; we can't find out anymore.\"\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiangbei stood up and said to Shen Lingdong, \"I'm going back to organize the report. You... are on your own. If there's nothing else, go and clean up that underground warehouse.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the time and then said, \"Let's clean it up tomorrow.\"\n\nAfter Lin Xiangbei left, Shen Lingdong's phone suddenly rang. It was his mother calling.\n\nAs soon as he answered the phone, he heard his mother anxiously shouting from the other end, \"Dong, hurry back.\"\n\nStartled, Shen Lingdong quickly asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\nWhile talking on the phone, he stood up and walked outside.\n\n\"A lot of people have come to the company...\"\n\nShen Lingdong thought he had inadvertently offended someone and that they had come to the company to cause trouble. Just as he was about to tell his mother to call the police, he suddenly heard his mother continue, \"They all want to join our cleaning company.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback, then said to his mother, \"Have them fill out the forms first. I'll be back soon.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Li Xianglan quickly replied. The call hadn't ended yet, and he heard his mother calling from the other end, \"Old Zheng, do you know where the interview application forms are?\"\n\n\"I don't know either. Wasn't Yuan Yuan in charge of this before?\" came Zheng's voice from the other end.\n\n...\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong returned to the company, there were more than twenty people at the company entrance, some squatting, some standing.\n\nShen Lingdong looked around and then noticed a rather stern figure among them, estimated to be under forty years old.\n\nHe recalled carefully and remembered seeing him at Anjie Home Services Company. Why had he come here?\n\nShen Lingdong went to the company entrance and asked the crowd, \"Are you here to interview for ordinary cleaning or specialized cleaning?\"\n\n\"Of course, for specialized cleaning.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"We can also offer interviews for specialized site cleaning work. The requirements are much higher. You need a bit of trace analysis and chemistry, as well as patience, love, and respect for the deceased. Most importantly, you need strong resilience because what you will face is not what you imagine, and it might even be more disgusting than you imagine.\"\n\n\"If you feel you meet these standards, you can proceed with an interview.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything, can I learn from you?\" shouted one of the young men.\n\nShen Lingdong smiled faintly and then said, \"That depends on your purpose for learning, and I can't teach you much.\"\n\n\"I'm willing to start with ordinary cleaning,\" the young man shouted again.\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"My cleaning company is a bit special. From now on, anyone joining the company will need to undergo a detailed investigation and strict assessment before being hired. If you want to interview, you can come in and fill out an application form, but I can give you a suggestion first: search for the most disgusting images online. If you can endure it without throwing up, you'll pass the preliminary test.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Shen Lingdong returned to the company.\n\nSeeing his mother and a few other aunts chatting, Shen Lingdong casually said, \"Why aren't there any women?\"\n\nLi Xianglan was startled and immediately asked, \"What do you want?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Yuan Yuan is gone, but our company still needs a receptionist to handle some miscellaneous tasks.\"\n\n\"Save some money. I'll do these things, can't we just do it like before? I've been a bit restless lately.\"\n\nShen Lingdong cleared his throat twice and said in a low voice, \"That's why the previous cleaning company almost went bankrupt...\"\n\n\"You little brat, don't think I didn't hear you!\" Li Xianglan slapped the table and exclaimed.\n\nOld Zheng grinned foolishly beside him.\n\nNot long after, several people walked into the company, including the middle-aged man in his forties.\n\nShen Lingdong asked the young men some questions and then told them to go back and wait for news, keeping only the middle-aged man.\n\nShen Lingdong called him upstairs and poured him a glass of water, then said, \"You're not here for an interview, are you?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was slightly taken aback and quickly said, \"I genuinely want to become a specialized site cleaner.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled faintly and then said, \"When you were at the door, you were taking pictures of the warehouse next to me with your phone. It's obvious you want to see what cleaning agents I use. But I can tell you that those cleaning agents are all my own special blends, and you won't be able to replicate them. If you also want to start a specialized site cleaning company, you should be cautious. I can tell you some common methods for cleaning pollution sources and protective measures. I know you're eyeing the high fees in this industry and want to get a piece of the pie. That's perfectly fine. If you can't get orders, I can even refer some to you. But don't treat it as a business and expect to make money from it.\"\n\nThe man's expression changed slightly, and he said with a grim face, \"Don't act so righteous. Aren't you just afraid we'll steal your business? In terms of economic strength, your Sunshine Cleaning can't compare to our Anjie Home Services. We can immediately assemble a professional and well-equipped team. And don't treat it as a business; how can we make money if it's not a business? Aren't you just relying on your connections in the Criminal Investigation Team to monopolize this industry? That sign you have at your door, I can make one in minutes.\"\n\n\"If that's the case, then I have nothing more to say. Please leave.\" Shen Lingdong said helplessly.\n\n\"We'll open our cleaning company across from you tomorrow, and we'll make you go bankrupt sooner or later.\"\n\nShen Lingdong said nothing, only making a gesture to usher him out.\n\nThe man then stood up and walked towards the exit.\n\nShen Lingdong leaned back on the sofa and sighed helplessly.\n\nA moment later, Shen Lingdong looked down through the window. After leaving his company, the man indeed went to the vacant property across the street.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly, thinking to himself, could he really be planning to open a specialized site cleaning company right across from him?\n\nAfter staying in the company for a while, Shen Lingdong felt restless. When there were no cases, his mind became idle and easily bored.\n\nHe then drove towards the Criminal Investigation Team.\n\nHe wanted to pick up Gu Caiwei after work and see if she had loosened up recently and could reveal some information about her father's murder case.\n\nHe arrived at the police station at exactly six o'clock.\n\nAfter waiting for a moment, Shen Lingdong saw Gu Caiwei, but there was another girl next to her.\n\nHe recalled carefully and realized that the girl was Di Fang.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, wondering why Di Fang was at the police station.\n\nAs Gu Caiwei walked out the door, she instinctively looked around and saw Shen Lingdong's car parked across the street. She quickly signaled Di Fang and they walked towards Shen Lingdong's car together.\n\nShen Lingdong in the car was stunned. If he had to say anything to Di Fang now, it wouldn't be convenient...\n\nThe two of them got into Shen Lingdong's car directly.\n\nShen Lingdong turned around and greeted Di Fang in the back seat, \"Long time no see.\"\n\nDi Fang smiled slightly and said, \"Long time no see. We'll be colleagues from now on.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback.\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei smiled at Shen Lingdong from the side and said, \"Di Fang has passed the civil service examination and has been successfully recruited by our bureau. Today is her first day reporting for duty.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and said, \"Congratulations, congratulations. I didn't expect you to be a police officer all along, but we're not colleagues yet, as I'm not a police officer.\"\n\nGu Caiwei then added, \"Di Fang is going to join your company.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Shen Lingdong was surprised and then retorted, \"On what grounds can you control my company's personnel arrangements?\"\n\nGu Caiwei immediately asked, \"Are you part of the Specialized Site Cleaning Team?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Doesn't the Specialized Site Cleaning Team report to the Aftercare Team?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Aren't I the team leader of the Aftercare Team?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Then what's wrong with me arranging for a police officer to intern with you?\"\n\n\"I... have nothing to say.\"\n\n\"Of course. Besides, the position is just to be stationed at your company to assist you in the对接 of specialized site tasks and the selection of team members. You don't have to pay her salary.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's good then.\" Shen Lingdong breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Look at how stingy you are.\"\n\n\"Not as generous as you.\"\n\nDi Fang in the back seat couldn't help but laugh at their interaction.\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong collected himself and said to Gu Caiwei, \"Did you already know Di Fang wanted to take the civil service exam? When I asked you to help persuade Di Fang to monitor Yuan Yuan, did you think I was a complete idiot?\"\n\nGu Caiwei smiled and nodded, saying, \"Very foolish. I almost couldn't stop myself from laughing.\"\n\nShen Lingdong angrily started the car and drove, saying, \"All your little schemes are used on me.\"",

    "content": "Chapter 139: The Victim's Family\n\nShen Lingdong initially planned to send Di Fang home first, then take Gu Caiwei home.\n\nHowever, Gu Caiwei informed Shen Lingdong that Di Fang would be staying at her place that night, which was a bit of a surprise to Shen Lingdong.\n\nObserving the two of them, he wondered when they had become best friends.\n\nSince that was the case, Shen Lingdong saved himself some trouble and drove directly to Gu Caiwei's apartment complex before returning home.\n\nThe next day.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong arrived at the company, Song Yu contacted him, wanting to discuss short video operations. Shen Lingdong asked Song Yu to come to the company to talk about signing a contract.\n\nIn the morning, Shen Lingdong finalized the contract matters and filmed a short video.\n\nIn the afternoon.\n\nShen Lingdong was on the first floor chatting with Wang Jizhong, Zheng Daoguang, and others.\n\nAs they were talking, Di Fang appeared at the doorway, holding a document.\n\nDi Fang lightly knocked on the company's door. Shen Lingdong quickly went to greet her and said, \"Officer Di, are you here to start working?\"\n\nDi Fang smiled slightly and said, \"Boss, what are you talking about? I'm your employee.\"\n\nShen Lingdong pointed to the reception area and said, \"This was Yuan Yuan's previous spot. You can sit here for now.\"\n\nDi Fang then handed the document in her hand to Shen Lingdong and said, \"These are the profiles of the interviewees from yesterday. There are no issues. As for who you want to hire, that's up to you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the profiles and quietly took them upstairs. In the past, he could have handed such matters over to Yuan Yuan to notify the candidates. But now, although Di Fang was nominally his employee, she was still a police officer, and he couldn't possibly order a police officer to do such tasks.\n\nBack upstairs, Shen Lingdong reviewed the four candidates' profiles again. After a moment of hesitation, he decided to hire all four of them.\n\nAfter all, although Zheng Daoguang and Wang Jizhong would participate in the cleaning work, even if their physical condition was good, Shen Lingdong wouldn't have them do heavy manual labor. He would only assign them some simple tasks.\n\nThere was no need to mention Zheng Daoguang; the rental of this commercial space was from him.\n\nAlthough Shen Lingdong was now capable of paying the full rent for this commercial space, Zheng Daoguang's help at the beginning had provided him with immense assistance. He would always remember Old Zheng's kindness for this reason.\n\nMoreover, his metaphysical knowledge had almost no practical use in cleaning, but it could provide great peace of mind to the families, which was also something Shen Lingdong needed.\n\nWang Jizhong's current physical condition was still good, but the company's current situation did not require him to be on the front lines of cleaning work. He only needed to train the new employees. His twenty-plus years of criminal investigation experience was the most important.\n\nJust then, Wang Jizhong came upstairs and quietly asked Shen Lingdong, \"Is that Di Fang a police officer?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"Yes. She just got hired and Gu Caiwei sent her here for an internship.\"\n\nWang Jizhong smiled slightly and said, \"This little girl, since you need to hire a receptionist anyway, instead of a stranger, it's better to place someone you know by your side. She's not helping you work, she's clearly here to monitor you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"At our company, the receptionist position is quite important. They can access almost all of the company's business. Therefore, we must have a reliable person to avoid a repeat of what happened with Yuan Yuan.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Wang Jizhong nodded.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then stood up and said to Wang Jizhong, \"Let's go downstairs and chat.\"\n\nAt this moment, Li Xianglan inexplicably appeared at the company. Shen Lingdong hadn't seen her when he returned earlier. She was currently sitting in front of Di Fang, asking, \"Little girl, what's your name? Do you have a boyfriend?\"\n\nShen Lingdong's expression was a bit helpless. His mother's old habit had resurfaced.\n\nAs Shen Lingdong went downstairs, he said to Li Xianglan, \"Mom... don't make it sound like a background check. I think I heard Yuan Yuan say last time that she has a boyfriend, right, Di Fang?\"\n\nDi Fang nodded shyly and said, \"Yes, we met when we were signing up. We were both applying to be police officers and are now at a police station. I was a bit luckier, as the criminal investigation team needed a desk job, so I was transferred. He actually wanted to join the criminal investigation team as well.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled slightly and said, \"When you have time, invite him over. We can all get acquainted. If he's truly capable, joining the criminal investigation team won't be a problem. Doesn't the criminal investigation team need people now?\"\n\nDi Fang nodded and said, \"He's seen you online and knows I'm working for you. He's quite happy about it and plans to come and see us after work today.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the people in the room. Everyone was here today, and there wasn't much going on. Thinking this, Shen Lingdong said, \"Since there's nothing much going on today, I'll treat everyone to a meal.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, Boss,\" Di Fang smiled.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, it was evening.\n\nShen Lingdong had booked a private room at a restaurant near the company, waiting for Di Fang's boyfriend. His boyfriend appeared at the restaurant punctually.\n\nHe was a tall and handsome young man.\n\nDi Fang quickly went forward and took his arm, introducing them to each other.\n\nThe young man's name was Qin Shu.\n\nAfter greeting everyone, Qin Shu said to Shen Lingdong, \"Brother, I've seen your videos online. I think you're amazing.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly shook his head, \"No, no.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he motioned for Di Fang to quickly get Qin Shu to sit down and chat.\n\nAt this moment, Wang Jizhong looked at Qin Shu next to Di Fang. His expression seemed a little familiar. After a moment of hesitation, he asked Qin Shu, \"Young Qin, why did you want to become a police officer?\"\n\nQin Shu smiled slightly and said, \"I've wanted to be a police officer since I was young, but I didn't get into the police academy. I graduated two years ago and only got in after two years of trying.\"\n\n\"Oh, not bad, very good,\" Wang Jizhong responded softly.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately said, \"Don't let his appearance fool you; he's an old hand in the criminal investigation team. If you want to be a criminal investigator, you can ask him for advice.\"\n\nQin Shu nodded and said, \"Although I'm at a police station now, I believe I'll eventually join the criminal investigation team.\"\n\nWang Jizhong immediately said, \"It's simple to join the criminal investigation team... it's just a matter of a word. However, whether you can stay in the criminal investigation team long-term depends on your ability. But we have quite a lot of contact with the criminal investigation team. Coming to us more often will be beneficial, and it will also increase your chances of being discovered by Lin Xiangbei.\"\n\nQin Shu nodded and said, \"Although I'm in a grassroots position, if you need any help, please don't hesitate to ask. Di Fang is interning with you, and we're all family.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Shen Lingdong replied, glancing at Qin Shu, then he urged the waiter to serve the dishes.\n\nAfter that, everyone continued to chat.\n\nQin Shu was very talkative and enthusiastic, and soon got along with everyone.\n\nNo one drank alcohol. After the meal, everyone went home.\n\nAfter Shen Lingdong saw everyone off, he looked at Wang Jizhong beside him and asked, \"Why are you still here? Should I give you a ride home?\"\n\n\"No need. I'll take a taxi back later. I stayed behind because I wanted to tell you something. Have you noticed anything special about Di Fang's boyfriend?\"\n\nShen Lingdong's expression immediately turned serious, and he said to Wang Jizhong, \"I noticed. He should be Qin Qin's brother. However, I don't think he appeared here to get close to me. During our conversation, I tested him a few times, and he absolutely refused to mention his sister's case, nor does he know that I am the killer's son.\"\n\nWang Jizhong nodded and said, \"I've seen their family's information before. He is indeed the brother of the victim in your father's case. When Qin Qin had the accident, he was in his second year of university. Five years have passed, and he has also become a police officer. Although he hasn't mentioned his sister Qin Qin's affairs, I feel that he is here to investigate his sister's case.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and retorted, \"For them, that case has already been closed. The murderer has been brought to justice and has been detained for many years. What else is there to investigate?\"\n\nWang Jizhong hesitated for a moment, then slowly said, \"The best-case scenario is that he also doesn't believe your father was the murderer. In that case, he would actually be on the same side as you. However, regardless, you should temporarily not let him know that you are the son of the killer who murdered his sister. As for you... you can learn more inside information from him.\"\n\nShen Lingdong's body trembled.\n\nWang Jizhong continued, \"He hasn't seen the case files of your father's case at all, so there's no need for secrecy. To you, he is just a victim's family member. What you learn from him is also the testimony of a victim's family member.\"\n\nAt this time, the taxi Qin Shu and Di Fang were in had long since departed, but Shen Lingdong still stared intently in the direction they left, as if contemplating something.\n\nThe next day.\n\nShen Lingdong arrived at the company very early. After waiting for a while, Di Fang appeared at the company.\n\nSeeing Shen Lingdong cleaning the room and organizing all the items, she approached Shen Lingdong.\n\nDi Fang took out a small box from her bag and handed it to Shen Lingdong, saying, \"Thank you, Brother Shen, for saving me that day.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly stunned, then suddenly realized. Earlier, in the Rongcheng Garden case, Shen Lingdong had warned her that the landlord was problematic and had arranged for her to stay at Gu Caiwei's place for a night, and later introduced her to Yuan Yuan, and they shared an apartment.\n\nShen Lingdong accepted the box and asked, \"It's not anything valuable, is it? If it's too valuable, I won't take it. But, if you give me a gift, won't your boyfriend be angry?\"\n\n\"No, he told me to give you a gift when I told him about you. But I didn't know what to give. He chose this gift himself.\"\n\n\"You two... instead of talking about romance, you talk about me?\" Shen Lingdong smiled, then shook the gift in his hand and asked, \"What's inside?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He put it in himself. If you don't like it, don't blame me.\"\n\n\"How could I? Thank you.\"\n\nDi Fang smiled slightly and said, \"Qin Shu really admires you and thinks you're very capable. He also asked me, 'Why doesn't someone as capable as you become a police officer?'\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"How would I know why you don't want to be a police officer...\"\n\nShen Lingdong put down the tools in his hand and said to Di Fang, \"I was thinking yesterday, if you don't have anything else to do, could you also handle the cleaning staff's work for me? It's not heavy work, just answering the phone and assigning tasks.\"\n\n\"That's no problem. Group Leader Gu has already briefed me. My responsibility is to prevent bad people from infiltrating your company and to be the first line of defense for Sunshine Cleaning.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"A heavy responsibility. You can get busy now. If there's anything you don't understand, ask me. I'll be upstairs.\"\n\nWith that, Shen Lingdong walked upstairs.\n\nUpon entering the office, Shen Lingdong looked at the gift box and began to ponder.\n\nQin Shu asked him why he didn't become a police officer. Although Di Fang didn't know, it was enough to show that he had already paid attention to this matter. With his status as a police officer, it would be easy to find out his background. Perhaps he already knew he was Shen Chaonan's son.\n\nThinking of this, Shen Lingdong slowly opened the gift box. Inside was a photograph, a photo of a girl.\n\nAlthough Shen Lingdong had never seen Qin Qin's appearance, after seeing the photo, he guessed that the girl in the photo was Qin Qin.\n\nShen Lingdong flipped the back of the photo, and there was a line of text: \"If you have time, we can talk.\"\n\nShen Lingdong pondered for a moment, then went downstairs and said to Di Fang, \"I plan to create a group and invite your boyfriend into it. Please forward his WeChat contact card to me.\"\n\nDi Fang didn't think much of it and casually sent Shen Lingdong Qin Shu's WeChat. She even smiled and asked Shen Lingdong, \"What did he give you as a gift? Do you like it?\"\n\n\"I like it very much,\" Shen Lingdong smiled.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately added Qin Shu on WeChat.\n\nNot long after, Qin Shu accepted Shen Lingdong's friend request.\n\nBefore Shen Lingdong could say anything.\n\nQin Shu sent a message. The first sentence was: Qin Qin is my sister. If you have time, we can talk. I have some things I want to tell you.\n\nShen Lingdong replied, \"At noon, I'll come to your police station to find you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Qin Shu replied, and then added a map coordinate.\n\nShen Lingdong fell into thought, looking at their brief chat.\n\nIt seemed he had already learned about him. However, from his appearance, he didn't seem to have any hostility towards him. If he could truly tell him some of what he knew, it would be of great help in understanding the truth of his father's case.",

    "title": "Chapter 140 Father's Case",
    "content": "At noon.\n\nShen Lingdong drove to the police station in the southern part of the city and waited for Qin Shu at the entrance of the station.\n\nNot long after, Qin Shu walked out of the police station. He looked around the entrance and found Shen Lingdong's car parked across the road. He then crossed the road and walked towards Shen Lingdong's vehicle.\n\nQin Shu got into Shen Lingdong's car directly.\n\nAfter getting into the car, Qin Shu got straight to the point and said to Shen Lingdong, \"Brother Dong, I believe Uncle Shen is innocent.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned slightly, looked at Qin Shu, and then asked, \"Do you have any evidence?\"\n\nQin Shu shook his head and said, \"No, but I know Uncle Shen. He would never do such a thing.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"I know him better than anyone, but the evidence is right in front of us. Feelings alone cannot prove my father is innocent.\"\n\nQin Shu nodded and said, \"I know. Although I don't have evidence, I do know some things about my sister's murder.\"\n\n\"What things?\" Shen Lingdong asked urgently.\n\n\"The place where my sister had her accident is a picking garden. Many people go there every summer, mostly people from the city who haven't seen much of the world. My sister planned to open a bed and breakfast there. It didn't need many rooms, five rooms would be enough. My parents gave her some money to do this.\"\n\n\"Although my family is from the countryside, we made some money by selling land a few years ago. Moreover, land is not expensive where I live.\"\n\n\"On the day my sister had her accident, the bed and breakfast was almost built. I was at the scene, not my sister. I don't remember the exact time, but I'm sure it was in the afternoon. Uncle Shen appeared at the door carrying a large bag of salt. He said we had ordered a large bag of salt from them.\"\n\n\"However, my sister hadn't mentioned this to me, so I called her to ask. She said she hadn't ordered any salt. So, I asked Uncle Shen to leave. Uncle Shen also took out his phone and called back. It surprisingly dialed my sister's number. The number in Uncle Shen's hand was the number that had called him to order salt.\"\n\n\"The police later explained this to us. The number on Uncle Shen's phone was not a virtual number. And on my sister's phone, there was indeed a call record from Uncle Shen. I don't know why, but after the case was closed, the police explained to us that Uncle Shen had forged the call records.\"\n\n\"At that time, my sister felt there must be some misunderstanding. She asked Uncle Shen to wait for her, saying she was on her way back. In fact, she also needed a batch of salt. She wanted to go back and check the salt. If the quality was good, she could place a bulk order.\"\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong immediately asked, \"Why did your sister want to order salt?\"\n\nQin Shu quickly said, \"Salt bath.\"\n\n\"Isn't there special bath salt?\" Shen Lingdong paused slightly, then asked again, \"Was your sister planning to make her own bath salts?\"\n\nQin Shu quickly said, \"I'm not sure about that.\"\n\n\"What was your sister's major in college?\" Shen Lingdong asked urgently.\n\n\"Media major. It was just when short videos were starting to rise. My sister found a professional to shoot a promotional video,\" Qin Shu replied.\n\n\"From what I understand, I went to a nearby convenience store between 3 PM and 9 PM to buy cigarettes, meaning he stayed at your sister's place longer than that,\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\nQin Shu then said, \"I don't know what time in the afternoon, but he was at my sister's bed and breakfast before 6 PM. After 6 PM, I had to catch a train back to school, so I left first.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and then asked, \"What was he doing there? After you left, were only your sister and my father there?\"\n\nQin Shu nodded and said, \"Although the phone call showed they didn't know each other, they chatted very happily after meeting.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Qin Shu in surprise. In his impression, his father was not a talkative person.\n\n\"Oh, right. Your dad seemed to be a reader of my sister's. My sister earned some money writing online and then added some from home to open this bed and breakfast. My sister wrote mystery novels, and the most they talked about after meeting were the cases in them.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and said, \"I understand that he would not delay the delivery for this, as that was the time for delivery.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"Based on this alone, you believe my father so much? Did anything else happen?\"\n\n\"After my sister returned, although she didn't know why she had his number, she still planned to buy that bag of salt. However, your father was no longer willing to sell it. He felt that someone was interfering. He remembered a case my sister had written, which involved a similar method of operation, but because it was a small case and the time interval was long, my sister had already forgotten about it.\"\n\n\"Later, I was busy with other things and didn't listen to their conversation, but I could see them. From their appearance at the time, my sister trusted Uncle Shen very much. Then I left. The next day, I received a message from Uncle Shen. He told me about my sister's murder and said that he would take the blame. This was the only chance to find the killer. He also specifically emphasized that I should not tell the police about this.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned again, not expecting the connection between the two.\n\nIf his father was not the murderer, based on the current information, someone impersonated Qin Qin and called his father to order a bag of salt, using Qin Qin's phone.\n\nMobile phones are usually carried with one, unless in certain special circumstances.\n\nAt that time, Qin Qin was filming the promotional video for the bed and breakfast...\n\nPromotional video.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately thought of someone.\n\nThe director.\n\nBut his father was at the scene the whole time. How did the killer commit the murder?\n\nDid the killer murder Qin Qin while his father was out buying cigarettes?\n\nBut what was the killer's motive?\n\nShen Lingdong could only think of two possibilities: one related to mystery novels, and the second related to the bed and breakfast. Qin Qin's bed and breakfast affected the interests of some people.\n\nBut regardless of the situation, it had nothing to do with his father.\n\nBut why did his father say that only by admitting guilt could the killer be found?\n\nAnd...\n\nAlthough his father was kind-hearted, he wouldn't be so selfless as to go to jail for a stranger and delay his son from becoming a police officer.\n\nWhat would make him do this wasn't Qin Qin.\n\nIt was his own family, his wife, and his children.\n\nCould this matter be related to him or his mother?\n\n\"How is it, Brother Dong? Do you have any thoughts?\" Qin Shu asked Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head slightly and then asked, \"Did you mention your desire to be a police officer during your conversation?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"He mentioned you, saying he had a son studying at the police academy. I casually said that I also wanted to be a police officer.\"\n\nQin Shu then said, \"He even encouraged me. It was for this reason that after graduation, I didn't go to work but started preparing for the police exam.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"If my father was the killer, these messages he left you could become evidence for an appeal, especially since you are a police officer, and these words would have greater credibility.\"\n\n\"By the way, after I got on the train, my sister video-called me. She said some things about studying hard and taking care of parents when she grew up. She also told me to find a girlfriend soon. She told me a lot, including her bank card password. I was a bit impatient at the time and didn't listen carefully. Later, I thought about it, and my sister might have been telling me her last words. She seemed to already know she was going to die. Later, I felt that Uncle Shen staying there was definitely not to commit murder, but to protect my sister.\"\n\nShen Lingdong lowered his head and pondered, not speaking.\n\nQin Shu continued, \"This has always been a knot in my heart. Coincidentally, I learned from Di Fang that you are Uncle Shen's son, so I wanted to tell you about this. You can definitely save Uncle Shen, right?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded slightly and then said, \"I will, if he is not the killer. However, I want some of your sister's social connections. Can you help me get them? Also, I plan to take a look at your sister's...\"\n\nQin Shu nodded and said, \"Her things are all at home, put away by my parents. I'll go get them after work tonight.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then asked, \"Uncle and Aunt, if they see me and know that I am the son of the murderer of their daughter...\"\n\nQin Shu quickly waved his hand and said, \"Don't... they won't be able to take it.\"\n\n\"Then, how about I buy some gifts, and you can help me send them to Uncle and Aunt?\"\n\n\"No need. Finding the real killer is the best gift.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Shen Lingdong replied softly.\n\nQin Shu glanced at the time and then said, \"Let's stop here for today. After I get the things, I'll deliver them to you tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I'll come over to pick them up.\"\n\n\"That's fine too.\" Qin Shu responded softly.\n\nJust as Qin Shu was about to get out of the car, Shen Lingdong suddenly asked again, \"That... Tang Feng, do you know him? He used to be at this police station.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know him, but he's no longer here. He's been transferred to the special task force.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and then asked, \"How's your relationship?\"\n\nQin Shu then said, \"He was the one who always mentored me. But after he was transferred, we were all happy.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and then said, \"Alright, I got it. Hurry up and go.\"\n\n\"Then, Brother Shen, I'll be leaving now.\" Qin Shu got out and returned to the police station.\n\nShen Lingdong stared blankly for a moment, then drove towards Lin Yu Road, which was the location where Qin Qin was killed.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong arrived at the scene of the crime that year, it was no longer the same. The original bed and breakfast had now become a garbage dump.\n\nAnd the picking garden was gone. In fact, because it had been neglected for a long time, it was overgrown with weeds.\n\nShen Lingdong got out of the car and strolled around the vicinity.\n\nAfter a while, Shen Lingdong walked to a stone. It was covered with moss. Shen Lingdong carefully cleared the moss and then saw five words carved on it: \"Happiness Picking Garden.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, wondering if there was any connection between Happiness Picking Garden and Happiness Nursing Home.\n\nA moment later, Shen Lingdong took out his phone, took a photo, and sent it to Gu Caiwei, asking her to help investigate who the owner behind Happiness Picking Garden was.\n\nA moment later, Shen Lingdong received a reply from Gu Caiwei.\n\nThe owner of Happiness Picking Garden was Lu Shitu, but it had closed down five years ago.\n\nA moment later, Gu Caiwei sent another message, \"Are you still investigating your father's case?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Shen Lingdong replied.\n\nGu Caiwei continued, \"The picking garden closed down because of Qin Qin's case, which led to no one visiting the garden. However, this did not affect Lu Shitu's business. It was just one of his many public welfare projects.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then replied, \"Is this a coincidence? Whenever Lu Shitu appears, there is a murder case nearby?\"\n\n\"You've reminded me. I can check all the projects Lu Shitu has participated in. By comparing them with the murder cases that have occurred in the past ten years, we can determine if it's a coincidence. If it's only these two cases, it's not a big problem, but if the number is large, it would be significant.\"\n\n\"I have also obtained some clues about my father's case.\"\n\n\"Lin Xiangbei agreed to let you investigate?\"\n\n\"I found out through other channels,\" Shen Lingdong replied.\n\nAfter a long time, Gu Caiwei replied, \"It's Qin Shu, right? Di Fang's boyfriend?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I knew it. His name is so similar to Qin Qin's. So there really is a connection.\"\n\n\"They are siblings. I'll come to see you after work and tell you what I learned today. Maybe you'll have other ideas?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nShen Lingdong put away his phone and then went to the former bed and breakfast, which had now become a garbage dump.\n\nBecause it was entirely made of wood, the house had collapsed under the wind and sun. Many people piled garbage in this place. Since the place was remote, no one cleaned it, causing it to reek.\n\nHowever, in Shen Lingdong's eyes, the garbage was automatically screened out.\n\nHe now felt as if he were at the crime scene at that time, but because he didn't have much information, the scene he recreated was extremely vague.\n\nAfter observing for a while, Shen Lingdong did not come up with any new ideas. He then glanced at the convenience store not far away. The distance from here to there was only about a five-minute walk.\n\nHowever, five minutes was not enough time to kill Qin Qin.\n\nTherefore, when Qin Qin was murdered, his father must have been at the scene.\n\nHe might have even witnessed it.",

    "content": "Shen Lingdong currently had no ideas, but he didn't leave either. In this cold weather, he found it easier to calm down.\n\nIt wasn't until his hands and feet became numb from the cold that he returned to his car and drove home.\n\nThe next day.\n\nIn the morning, Qin Shu sent Shen Lingdong a novel written by his sister, Qin Qin.\n\nQin Qin had been writing novels since university, serializing them online. She had written four novels in recent years.\n\nShen Lingdong spent most of the morning reading Qin Qin's novel. However, unlike reading other novels at lightning speed, he read it word for word, so his progress wasn't very fast.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, it was noon.\n\nShen Lingdong received some of Qin Qin's belongings from Qin Shu, packed neatly into a large cardboard box.\n\nThese were things that Qin Qin's family kept at their home.\n\nA photo album, a backpack, a laptop, a wallet, a mobile phone, and some unfinished handicrafts.\n\nShen Lingdong took out the laptop and pressed the power button, but it didn't respond. Shen Lingdong then glanced at the mobile phone; it was also out of battery. The charging port was a Micro-B model.\n\nRecalling this, Shen Lingdong rummaged through a drawer and found a charger with the same interface, then plugged it into the power outlet.\n\nWhile the phone was charging.\n\nShen Lingdong then opened the photo album. The album looked quite worn, especially in the areas that were frequently flipped through.\n\nIn the album, the first photo was a graduation group photo from university. Following that were several individual photos or photos of two or three people. This section took up the majority of the album.\n\nNext were Qin Qin's artistic photos.\n\nHowever, after flipping through the entire album, Shen Lingdong didn't find any photos of her childhood.\n\nShen Lingdong then took out a photo and examined it carefully. The photo was well-preserved and looked quite new.\n\nAt this moment, the phone had gained some charge. Shen Lingdong then turned it on.\n\nUpon powering on, Shen Lingdong's first action was to check the call history. The last three calls were to \"Dad,\" \"Mom,\" and a number with no saved name, which was his father's number.\n\nBefore that, it was Qin Shu's number.\n\nThis call should have been when Qin Shu was asking his sister Qin Qin if she had ordered a large bag of salt. The displayed time was 13:24.\n\nShen Lingdong recalled that his father had left at 6 AM to make deliveries in Nanjiang City. It would take an hour or two to arrive. Even if the orders were distributed throughout Nanjiang City, he should have finished delivering them by morning. Therefore, after finishing his deliveries, his father must have delivered Qin Qin's ordered salt when he passed by Linyu Road.\n\nHowever, why didn't his father deliver it in the morning when he drove past Linyu Road?\n\nShen Lingdong remembered that his father had a habit of planning his delivery routes the day before and would always prioritize closer destinations.\n\nFurthermore, it wasn't the case that Qin Qin called to order salt after his father had already prepared for delivery; the goods his father delivered were arranged the day before.\n\nBut, in reality, Qin Qin only called his father to order salt at 10:20 AM.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the only possibility was that someone among the merchants his father was delivering to had returned goods. Coincidentally, Qin Qin had ordered salt at that time, which would then lead his father to deliver it to Qin Qin.\n\nThus, the merchant's return of goods and Qin Qin's order might not have been a coincidence.\n\nTherefore, if he could find that person who returned the goods, it would become a clue. However, five years had passed, and it was likely impossible to find that person.\n\nShen Lingdong recalled briefly.\n\nHe then called his mother and asked if his father's old items were still there.\n\nThe night before the incident, his father had planned the routes for the merchants he would be delivering to the next day. If he could find that day's notebook, he might know which stores his father had visited for deliveries.\n\nEven so, Shen Lingdong couldn't guarantee that those stores still existed.\n\nAfter receiving a positive answer from his mother, Shen Lingdong hurried downstairs and drove back home.\n\nWhen he returned home, his mother had already gathered all of his father's belongings. Besides his usual work items, she had even taken out his clothes.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the piles of clothes spread on the floor and asked, \"Mom, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you need, so I've brought everything out.\"\n\nShen Lingdong rummaged through the items on the floor and opened a leather suitcase. Inside were books and work-related items that his father often read.\n\nAlthough his father was an ordinary person with an ordinary job, he loved the Criminal Investigation Bureau and enjoyed reading detective novels, such as \"Sherlock Holmes,\" \"And Then There Were None,\" and \"I Always Get Murdered\" - highly-rated, classic mystery novels. Shen Lingdong was also influenced by this and developed a passion for deduction.\n\nAfter his father was imprisoned, Li Xianglan, who already felt these items took up space, put them all away.\n\n\"I only need this box,\" Shen Lingdong said, looking at the leather suitcase in front of him.\n\n\"Why didn't you say so earlier? You made me find all these things. Now I have to pack them all back up.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked around and then said, \"Just leave them out for now. If we're lucky, Dad will be out soon, and these things can be used. If we're unlucky... there's no need to keep them.\"\n\nLi Xianglan was startled and quickly asked, \"What happened? Are you investigating your dad's case now?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"I just got some clues recently.\"\n\n\"How is it? How are things going now?\"\n\n\"I just started investigating, no progress yet.\"\n\n\"Don't rush, investigate slowly.\"\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong took out a notebook from the suitcase and flipped to the middle section. After searching for a while, Shen Lingdong found his father's work log for that day.\n\nIt recorded the delivery addresses, a total of eight locations, marked with serial numbers indicating the order.\n\nPingping Grain and Oil Store, West Gate of Jinhua Residential Area, 5.\n\nLiangxin Grain and Oil Store, South Third Road, 2.\n\nJingpin Grain and Oil Store, No. 23 Dongta Road, 7.\n\nXingfu Grain and Oil Store, East Wang Street, Nancheng Road, 3.\n\n...\n\nChengxin Grain and Oil Store, Kaihe Road, Lane Seventeen, 1.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong saw Xingfu Grain and Oil Store, he was slightly taken aback. He then searched online but couldn't find that Xingfu Grain and Oil Store at the location his father had recorded.\n\nAfter searching for other grain and oil stores, Shen Lingdong only found three.\n\nOut of the total eight stores, only three remained.\n\nShen Lingdong took a backpack from his room, took out some items from his father's suitcase, and put them in the backpack. He then returned to the company, brought Qin Qin's laptop, photo album, and mobile phone.\n\nAfterward, he headed to Nanjiang City.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong arrived in Nanjiang City, he went to the first grain and oil store, Jingpin Grain and Oil Store.\n\nThis grain and oil store hadn't closed yet. Shen Lingdong walked in and asked a few simple questions.\n\nThey had changed their procurement channels several times in recent years and had no recollection of events from five years ago. The next two stores were the same.\n\nThe first day of investigation faced immense difficulties. In front of Shen Lingdong was a huge barrier: time.\n\nFive years is not long, nor is it short, but for something that happened five years ago, unless it was particularly important, no one would have a strong recollection. Therefore, finding out about his father's affairs would likely be very difficult.\n\nHowever, when Shen Lingdong returned to the hotel, he remembered something.\n\nHe had just noticed that the grain and oil store, Jingpin Grain and Oil Store, sold individually packaged salt, and they had been selling this type for the past few years.\n\nAt that time, his father's deliveries weren't just salt; they also included rice and flour. Furthermore, his father delivered salt in large woven bags. Not many grain and oil stores purchased this type of bulk salt.\n\nThis was a breakthrough.\n\nHowever, the remaining five grain and oil stores had already closed down. The investigation tomorrow would undoubtedly be fraught with difficulty.\n\nUpon returning to his room, Shen Lingdong opened Qin Qin's mobile phone. The social media accounts were no longer accessible, and the passwords had expired. Fortunately, the account information was preserved.\n\nMoreover, the phone number had been canceled.\n\nIt would be difficult to recover the passwords.\n\nShen Lingdong sent a WeChat message to Qin Shu, asking if he knew his sister Qin Qin's account passwords.\n\nAlthough Qin Shu didn't know the passwords, he knew his sister had a poor memory, so she used the same password for all platforms. He also gave Shen Lingdong a hint: the password might be simple, perhaps an abbreviation of her name or her birthday.\n\nShen Lingdong tried several times without success.\n\nThe number of attempts to try each platform was limited.\n\nShen Lingdong tested each account once, and none were successful. Finally, he had to give up for the time being.\n\nIt seemed impossible to get any information by investigating through social media accounts.\n\nTherefore, Shen Lingdong had to start with the photo album.\n\nThis was the most telling clue about her state at the time, and he could even retrieve location information from the photos.\n\nIt was evident that Qin Qin was a girl who loved taking selfies; the majority of the photos in the album were selfies.\n\nHowever, Shen Lingdong still managed to glean some information.\n\nOn the day of the incident, Qin Qin went to a coffee shop. Although the background in the photos was blurred, there was no one behind her.\n\nAfterward, she went to a furniture city.\n\nThere were also a few selfies taken in a taxi.\n\nShen Lingdong roughly estimated her itinerary for the day. She first went to a coffee shop to meet someone, possibly a director or a planner, as Qin Qin's guesthouse was about to open, and they needed to discuss the filming of a promotional video in advance.\n\nHowever...\n\nEven if a promotional video was planned, it shouldn't be considered when the guesthouse wasn't even completed.\n\nMoreover, Shen Lingdong had visited the crime scene after the incident. At that time, Qin Qin's guesthouse only had five rooms. Judging by the decoration style, it wasn't a boutique route; they were just ordinary rooms. Clearly, profitability wasn't the primary goal.\n\nPerhaps Qin Qin opened this guesthouse not to attract tourists to the picking garden, but perhaps she had her own clientele or rented it out long-term to certain people.\n\nIn such a case, there would be no need to film a promotional video.\n\nShen Lingdong then flipped through more photos and found that there were photos of similar environments every so often. In addition to on-site photos, there were also screenshots of map software. He was not only building the guesthouse in Dongjiang City but also had investigated other cities.\n\nBefore investigating Linyu Road, Qin Qin had investigated four other locations, and each had screenshots of map software.\n\nMoreover, there were photos of every stage of construction for the guesthouse at Linyu Road.\n\nShen Lingdong suspected that Qin Qin had sent these photos to someone or some people.\n\nCould it be...\n\nShen Lingdong had an idea.\n\nPerhaps, Qin Qin wanted to build a guesthouse to live with like-minded friends. Therefore, her friends were likely also writers.\n\nHowever, Qin Qin's family wasn't very wealthy. Even if her family sold some land and acquired some money, it shouldn't have allowed her to risk it.\n\nOr perhaps...\n\nFor observation.\n\nA mystery novelist, to write well-developed characters, would conduct extensive observation of people. This is also one of the training methods for detectives.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and then found Qin Qin's novel online again. He opened the comment section to see who were the authors and had a high interaction with Qin Qin.\n\nLooking at the comment section, there were many abusive comments and many praises.\n\nShen Lingdong spent several hours compiling a list and used the private message function on the platform to send messages to all those authors, asking if they had ever considered co-renting with Qin Qin.\n\nHe waited for a long time but received no reply.\n\nJust as Shen Lingdong was about to go to bed, he suddenly received a reply.\n\nIt was from a female author named \"Shan Zhang.\"\n\nShe asked Shen Lingdong about his identity and his relationship with Qin Qin.\n\nThis female author knew Qin Qin's real name, suggesting they knew each other privately.\n\n\"I am Qin Qin's friend.\"\n\nThe female author then asked, \"Do you know why she stopped writing?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the message and replied to the female author, \"She was murdered.\"\n\n\"Ah? When did that happen? Can you tell me what exactly happened?\"\n\n\"Is it convenient to add WeChat? I have some things I want to ask you.\"\n\n\"Okay, qingtouzhangpiao.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then added the girl on WeChat and said, \"Qin Qin was murdered five years ago.\"\n\n\"Why? How could someone be so malicious? Did she offend someone?\"\n\n\"I'm not very clear about the motive for murder; there are still many doubts in this case.\"\n\n\"Hasn't the case been solved yet?\" the female author asked back.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the message and replied, \"The killer has been caught. Can you tell me about your relationship?\"",

    "content": "The author then made a voice call to Shen Lingdong, explaining her relationship with Qin Qin.\n\nShe and Qin Qin had known each other for nine years. At that time, both were serializing on a certain website, and neither was a particularly famous author.\n\nSince they were both university students, even though she was a year ahead of Qin Qin, they had many common interests.\n\nThe two of them were not in the same city and had never met.\n\nLater, they met four other friends, and the six of them formed a small group, encouraging each other. Gradually, everyone's writing saw some progress, and their monthly royalties were comparable to those of ordinary office workers, but they had much more free time than office workers.\n\nAfter graduation, they didn't go to work but chose to become full-time writers.\n\nLater, another female author suggested that they could rent a place together. They looked at many places at the time, but because there were many people, someone was always dissatisfied.\n\nQin Qin shared her idea with everyone. She had a dream of opening her own guesthouse, which didn't need to be too big, as long as the environment was quiet enough.\n\nIf everyone was willing, she could take this opportunity to build her guesthouse.\n\nThis proposal was quickly accepted by everyone, but problems arose again during the site selection. After a long search, they finally found the place.\n\nQin Qin would post updates about the guesthouse in the group every day.\n\nOne day, she told them that the guesthouse was almost completed, but after that, she disappeared.\n\nHer writing also stopped updating.\n\nAfter the woman finished speaking, Shen Lingdong asked, \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Xue Ru,\" the woman replied.\n\n\"Do you have the contact information of the other four female authors?\" Shen Lingdong continued to ask.\n\n\"Yes, after Qin Qin disappeared, we initially discussed what had happened to her every day. However, over time, our contact with each other became less frequent. Later, it was reduced to holiday greetings, and in the last year or two, we completely lost contact, but I still have their contact information.\"\n\n\"Can you send it to me?\"\n\nAfter a long pause, the other party replied to Shen Lingdong, \"Are you a police officer?\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at the message and hesitated. If he replied no, the other party might not give him the information of the other authors. However, if he replied yes, it would be the crime of impersonating a public official.\n\nAlthough he was a criminal investigation consultant, he did not have such authority.\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, Shen Lingdong replied to Xue Ru, \"I am not a police officer. My name is Shen Lingdong, and I am a member of the Special Scene Cleanup Team.\"\n\n\"Ah! You're that cleaner... I saw your video online.\"\n\nShen Lingdong saw that the situation was much easier, but he still had to explain some things: \"Actually, you have the right not to tell me the information of the other people, but I am investigating the cause of Xue Ru's death, which is very crucial for me.\"\n\n\"Didn't you just say the murderer has been caught? Why do you still need to investigate? Have you found any problems?\" Xue Ru asked again.\n\n\"There are hidden circumstances,\" Shen Lingdong replied lightly.\n\n\"Alright, please wait. I'll send you their information now.\"\n\nXue Ru then hung up the phone. A moment later, Shen Lingdong received four WeChat contact cards.\n\nShen Lingdong immediately added them as WeChat friends.\n\nHe then continued to ask, \"Were there any rifts between the six of you? Or did you form cliques?\"\n\n\"Yes, although the six of us had a good relationship, there were also differences in closeness among us. For example, I was the first one Qin Qin met, so our relationship was naturally a bit closer. The other four also had good relationships with Qin Qin, and I also had people I chatted well with and people I disliked. The six of us had a common group at the time, and we also had individual smaller groups in private. Based on my understanding, there were at least eight groups among the six of us.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was quite surprised by this result.\n\nXue Ru continued, \"It was comparable to a palace drama.\"\n\n\"Did you have any major conflicts?\"\n\n\"Major conflicts... I'm not really sure about that, but even if there were conflicts, they were all trivial matters, not enough to lead to murder, right?\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand. I'm really sorry to bother you so late.\"\n\n\"It's okay. I hope you can find out the truth as soon as possible. If there's anything you want to know, feel free to ask me. I'll tell you everything I know.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you.\"\n\nShen Lingdong put away his phone and fell into deep thought.\n\nNot long after, Shen Lingdong received two friend request approvals. Shen Lingdong chatted with them for a while longer and learned that the situation was basically the same as what Xue Ru had told him.\n\nTwo people had not yet approved Shen Lingdong's friend requests, so Shen Lingdong did not add them further. He recorded their information and handed it over to Gu Caiwei, asking her to help investigate. Compared to those without authority, Gu Caiwei could more easily understand the whole truth.\n\nShen Lingdong now knew the real reason why Qin Qin was building the guesthouse: it was to provide a quiet writing environment for the other authors.\n\nAlthough this was a big undertaking, it could still be profitable. For example, the rent, utilities, and meal expenses for the other five people could all be charged, it would just take a long time to recoup the costs.\n\nThis situation also coincided with Shen Lingdong's previous suspicions.\n\nQin Qin had not intended to attract other guests in the early stages, so there was no need for a promotional video, nor would she actively seek out professionals to discuss this matter.\n\nMoreover, according to the information provided by Qin Shu, Qin Qin went to discuss filming a promotional video that day, and Qin Qin also seemed to be waiting for someone at the coffee shop.\n\nTherefore, there was a possibility that someone had contacted Qin Qin proactively, perhaps by offering free filming or through other means, to get Qin Qin to meet them.\n\nAfter a slight hesitation, Shen Lingdong checked Qin Qin's text message records and found several bank expenditure messages.\n\nFive years ago, although mobile payments were already popular, people still kept their money in bank cards and did not store it in payment apps. Therefore, every time Qin Qin made a purchase, a message would be left.\n\nThe latest one was 51 yuan.\n\nThe next one was a consumption of 38 yuan.\n\nShen Lingdong then checked. The coffee shop was located in the city center of Dongjiang City. The taxi fare from there to Lin Yu Road would be around fifty yuan. Therefore, the last expenditure should be the money Qin Qin spent on the taxi from the coffee shop back to Yulin Road.\n\nAnd that 38 yuan consumption... based on the time, it should be a consumption within the coffee shop.\n\nShen Lingdong frowned.\n\nIf the other party had proactively invited Qin Qin to the coffee shop, the other party should have paid, not the woman.\n\nOf course, there was also a possibility that the other party was also a woman.\n\nPerhaps... the other party never showed up.\n\nIf the other party was a woman... could it be one of the authors she wrote with?\n\nBut there was no motive.\n\nIt was true that the six of them might have some competition due to leaderboards or similar things, and this competition could also involve financial interests.\n\nIf the other five people had conflicts arising from these issues, which eventually escalated to murder, he could understand it.\n\nHowever, Qin Qin wrote mystery novels.\n\nCompared to the \"feel-good\" novels of the others, hers were inherently weaker, and Qin Qin primarily made money by selling copyrights.\n\nWithout financial interests involved, the motive for murder would lack much persuasiveness.\n\nIf the other party did not show up, it would lead to many possibilities.\n\nFor example, it could be to prevent Qin Qin from appearing at the guesthouse construction site during a certain period.\n\nIn this way, the entire case would be filled with conspiracy.\n\nHowever, there was one point: someone had used Qin Qin's phone to order salt during that period.\n\nIf that person did not show up, they could not have used Qin Qin's phone to order salt.\n\nEven if they used other methods?\n\nWhat was the purpose of doing so?\n\nThat period was exactly when his father appeared at the guesthouse construction site...\n\nIf his father appeared at the guesthouse construction site at that time, and Qin Qin happened to be there too.\n\nWhen his father asked if she needed salt, Qin Qin said she hadn't ordered any. His father would call to confirm, and then call Qin Qin's phone.\n\nBut Qin Qin insisted she hadn't ordered any salt.\n\nAt this point, Qin Shu might step in, and his father would have to return to the car and leave...\n\nSo, the killer's purpose was to keep his father at the guesthouse construction site?\n\nIf the other party was a woman, and a close author friend, borrowing a phone to make a call should not be a problem. However, such a killer would definitely not want anyone else present during the murder, let alone want his father to stay at the scene; instead, he would hope he would leave as soon as possible.\n\nTherefore, the possibility of the killer being Qin Qin's author friend was very slim.\n\nBut why would the killer leave his father at the crime scene and allow him to witness the entire murder process? What was the reason for this?\n\nAfter a moment of contemplation, a horrifying thought crossed Shen Lingdong's mind.\n\nBecause of himself?\n\nHe had always been his father's pride, and a photo of himself was also attached to his keychain.\n\nIf the killer recognized him, they would also recognize the relationship between his father and him.\n\nDuring his university years, he had indeed participated in many cases and sent many murderers to prison, which also earned him the nickname \"Detective\" at the Criminal Investigation Academy.\n\nCould it be that he made a mistake in his deduction in one of his cases, resulting in a miscarriage of justice?\n\nBut if that were the case, it would contradict the previous deduction.\n\nThe previous deduction was that the director was not targeting him, but the police. But now it seemed that the director was targeting him.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then made a phone call to Gu Caiwei and asked, \"Do you still remember the cases you solved in college?\"\n\nHe didn't hold out much hope. He himself didn't remember, let alone Gu Caiwei.\n\nAt that time, he was just enjoying the process of deduction and didn't care about the identity of the real culprit, which resulted in Shen Lingdong not having a deep impression of their identities and backgrounds. It was reasonable for him to forget.\n\nA moment later, Gu Caiwei replied, \"Yes, I remember. I remember every case.\"\n\nThis answer was somewhat unexpected. He quickly asked back, \"You remember everything? Every case?\"\n\n\"Theft case in the Dongshi Normal University girls' dormitory, the sanitation worker theft case, the body-sinking case in Yuming Lake, the mummified body case in Bali Zhuang, the corpse-swapping case in the funeral home... the sock-missing case in your dormitory... Do you want to hear more?\"\n\n\"Now that you mention it, I seem to have some impression. Send me everything you can remember, and it would be best if you could also check the current status of the real culprits.\"\n\n\"What do you need this for? Are you writing a resume?\" Gu Caiwei asked, then continued, \"I just got off work, and you're making me work overtime again...\"\n\n\"I'll treat you to a meal.\"\n\n\"That can be bribed. I'll organize it when I get home and give it to you tomorrow morning.\"\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at the time. It was already ten o'clock in the evening. He then said to Gu Caiwei, \"It's too late today, and I'm not in a hurry. I just suddenly thought of it and wanted to tell you. I'm not in a hurry. You can give it to me by noon tomorrow.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"What's the difference between this and giving it to you tomorrow morning? I don't work in the morning, so I'll still have to stay up late to help you with it.\"\n\n\"Just kidding, there's no rush. I still have a lot of things to investigate. Give me this clue when I'm stuck. I suspect the director is related to a case I solved in the past.\"\n\n\"Is that so? Then I'll finish it for you as soon as possible.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Shen Lingdong fell into deep thought. After thinking for a while, he found that he had no ideas.\n\nHe couldn't help but say to himself, \"I've run out of ideas so quickly?\"\n\nHesitating, Shen Lingdong lay down on the bed, took out his phone, and began to read Qin Qin's mystery novels.\n\nQin Qin's previous writings were a bit immature in their style, and the case designs were not that surprising. Shen Lingdong could guess the identity of the culprit after reading only a few chapters. However, her later works showed significant improvement.\n\nEspecially the last book.\n\nShen Lingdong saw the delivery man murder case. This case was well-written.\n\nSoon, he reached the latest chapter, which was also the last chapter published before her death.\n\nJuly 7th.\n\nBy the end, although it was not finished, for Shen Lingdong, who had already guessed the culprit's identity, there was no suspense.\n\nJust as he was about to exit the software, Shen Lingdong noticed something. The publication time was July 8th, when Qin Qin had already been murdered.\n\nSo who published it?\n\nAfter a slight hesitation, Shen Lingdong immediately sent a message to Xue Ru, asking if she was asleep.\n\nSoon, Xue Ru replied, \"Not yet. I'm watching your videos on a short video app. I feel like your profession is so great. I'm sorry, I called you a cleaner just now.\"\n\n\"It's okay. I have a question for you. Who published Qin Qin's latest chapter? On July 8th, and Qin Qin had already been murdered the day before.\"\n\n\"It might be a scheduled post. Check if the time is on the hour.\"\n\nHearing Xue Ru's words, Shen Lingdong quickly returned to the software and checked. The time was exactly 0:00:00.\n\nSo, it really was a scheduled post.\n\n\"Oh, I see. I thought one of you knew Qin Qin's author account and posted it to create the illusion that Qin Qin was still alive.\"\n\n\"It might be a previous draft that Qin Qin scheduled to publish. But I do know Qin Qin's author account. In the beginning, the website didn't have the scheduled posting function. One day, she had something to do and asked me to publish a chapter for her.\"\n\n7017k",

    "content": "**Chapter 143: Xingfu Grain and Oil Store**\n\n\"Can you still find that account?\" Shen Lingdong asked urgently.\n\nIf Qin Qin used the same password for all her accounts, it was possible to log into other social platforms using that password.\n\n\"I'll have to look for it; it's from a long time ago.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nAfter some time, Xue Ru sent Shen Lingdong an account and password.\n\n\"Alright, thank you.\"\n\nAfter thanking her, Shen Lingdong wrote down the account and password and attempted to log into other platforms using the password from the [Douyin] account.\n\nAlthough the first attempt failed, Shen Lingdong managed to log in successfully after changing the lowercase letters to uppercase.\n\nHe had only managed to log into two platforms so far: one for shopping and one for short videos.\n\nShen Lingdong then entered the shopping app and checked the orders.\n\nThese orders were from five years ago.\n\nThe items purchased were mostly daily necessities, clothes, cosmetics, and some books.\n\nShen Lingdong noticed that Qin Qin had purchased a transparent, full-body raincoat, rain boots, rubber gloves, and edible red coloring, which is used as stage blood.\n\nThe purchase date was a few days before Qin Qin's death.\n\nShen Lingdong continued to scroll down the orders and found records of Xue Ru purchasing design blueprints online. Shen Lingdong clicked on the customer service chat interface, and indeed, the chat content between the two was still preserved.\n\nThere was a file sent by customer service with a .dwg extension. Shen Lingdong clicked on it, but it didn't open.\n\nFortunately, Shen Lingdong found a screenshot of the file's thumbnail.\n\nIt was a construction blueprint.\n\nOn the west side, close to the road, was a reception room with a terrace, which also served as an activity room. On the south and east sides, there were three rooms each, and on the north side, there was a corridor. In the middle of the courtyard, there was a pavilion.\n\nThis was the overall plan for the guesthouse.\n\nHowever, in the subsequent chat content, Shen Lingdong saw another thumbnail. Judging from the chat content between Qin Qin and customer service, it was a blueprint for a basement.\n\nFrom Qin Qin's messages, it was evident that she attached great importance to this basement. Compared to the design of the other rooms, Qin Qin did not offer many suggestions for them. However, for the basement, Qin Qin proposed numerous ideas and insisted on building it according to her own vision.\n\nConnecting this to the raincoat and other items Qin Qin had purchased earlier, Shen Lingdong began to speculate about the purpose of the basement's construction.\n\nA chill ran down his spine.\n\nHowever, based on what Qin Shu had told him and the police investigation, the basement had not been discovered. Furthermore, the basement was designed as a separate blueprint, so its location was unknown.\n\nCurrently, the area was covered with heaps of garbage.\n\nTo find the basement, the mountains of garbage piled on top would need to be cleared first.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then found the photos of the guesthouse he had taken during the day, trying to see if there was anything unusual in the pictures.\n\nAfter looking through them, he found nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nChecking the time, it was already midnight.\n\nShen Lingdong then sent a message to Gu Caiwei: \"Are you still organizing the case? Stop for now and get some rest.\"\n\nGu Caiwei immediately retorted, \"Are you investigating Qin Qin's case too?\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly replied, \"How could I? I'm already in bed and about to sleep.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" Gu Caiwei said.\n\nShen Lingdong thought for a moment and was about to initiate a video call with Gu Caiwei for a surprise inspection.\n\nUnexpectedly, Gu Caiwei's video call came through first.\n\nShen Lingdong suddenly leaped onto the bed, covering himself with the quilt, with only his head exposed.\n\nThen, he answered the video call.\n\nBoth of them were under their covers, with only their heads showing.\n\n\"See, I'm ready to sleep,\" Gu Caiwei said to Shen Lingdong, yawning.\n\n\"Me too. If you hadn't called, I would have been asleep by now.\"\n\n\"Uncover your quilt, let me see what you're wearing inside?\" Gu Caiwei asked with a smile, looking playfully at the phone screen.\n\n\"I just took a shower, so I'm naked inside. Let me see yours too...\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\n\"Are you being a pervert?\" Gu Caiwei said angrily to Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"Don't tell me you girls are also naked...\"\n\n\"How is that possible? I'm wearing pajamas,\" Gu Caiwei said.\n\nAfter a brief pause, Gu Caiwei said to Shen Lingdong, \"To prevent you from secretly getting up to work after hanging up the video call, let's just sleep with the video on.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, \"Okay, but it's a bit hot in this room, and I've started sweating again. I need to take another shower.\"\n\nGu Caiwei also said, \"Then I'll go too.\"\n\nThen, both of them emerged from under their covers.\n\nGu Caiwei looked at Shen Lingdong, who was still wearing a jacket, and exclaimed excitedly, \"Look, you said you were naked, but you're still wearing that jacket!\"\n\n\"It's a bit chilly in the hotel, so I'm wearing more.\"\n\n\"You just said it was hot in the room and you were sweating, and you were going to take a shower. Now you're wearing clothes again. Are you playing dress-up with me?\"\n\n\"Alright, I actually found something out just now. I'll go take a shower first and tell you later.\"\n\nWith that, Shen Lingdong tossed his phone aside and went to take a shower.\n\nTen minutes later, Shen Lingdong returned to bed. Seeing that Gu Caiwei's phone was silent, he took out Xue Ru's phone and entered the short video app.\n\nOn her personal profile page, in the latest few videos, Shen Lingdong saw videos of the guesthouse construction process.\n\nThe previous videos were all promotional videos.\n\nShen Lingdong looked at his phone. Gu Caiwei's end was still silent. He then started watching Xue Ru's videos and, after finishing them, clicked on the comment section.\n\nThe number of comments on her videos was not high, with only about twenty comments per video.\n\nShen Lingdong read everyone's comments and clicked on the commenters' profiles to view their information.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, Gu Caiwei's voice came through the phone, \"I'm done. Are you asleep yet?\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately picked up his phone and said to Gu Caiwei, \"You're so slow. I was almost asleep.\"\n\n\"What did you find out earlier?\"\n\n\"Oh, I checked Xue Ru's phone. She bought a blueprint on Taobao, which is the design for the guesthouse. It also included a design for a basement. Additionally, she purchased a raincoat, rain boots, gloves, and blood plasma.\"\n\n\"Buying these things... what was she planning to do?\" Gu Caiwei asked urgently.\n\n\"I don't know...\"\n\n\"Is that all you found out today? Come on, give me a work report.\" Gu Caiwei asked.\n\n\"What kind of leader listens to a work report with messy hair and wearing pajamas?\"\n\n\"Every man has a leader at home, and aren't all leaders at home like this?\" After saying that, Gu Caiwei felt something was wrong and immediately became a little embarrassed.\n\nShen Lingdong cleared his throat twice and then said, \"I did find quite a few clues today, but none of them have progressed yet.\"\n\nThen, Shen Lingdong recounted all his findings from the day to Gu Caiwei.\n\nGu Caiwei lay on the bed, pressing her hand against her face, quietly listening to Shen Lingdong talk about his day's investigation. At this moment, she might not have cared about what Shen Lingdong was investigating anymore...\n\nUnconsciously, Gu Caiwei felt her eyelids getting heavy, and she closed her eyes.\n\nShen Lingdong didn't notice at all that Gu Caiwei on the other end of the phone had fallen asleep.\n\nAs he was recounting the investigation process, he was also organizing his thoughts. After he had finished speaking, Shen Lingdong finally looked at the phone and said, \"Do you have any thoug—\"\n\nBefore he could finish, he saw that Gu Caiwei had fallen fast asleep.\n\nShen Lingdong sighed softly, then lay down as well. Looking at Gu Caiwei on the phone screen, he whispered, \"Goodnight.\"\n\n...\n\nThe next day, Shen Lingdong, who was still sleeping, suddenly heard Gu Caiwei's voice from his phone, \"You dummy, still sleeping? Hurry up and get up.\"\n\nShen Lingdong immediately opened his eyes and looked at Gu Caiwei, who had just woken up, and said, \"You're up so early?\"\n\n\"What you said yesterday was so hypnotic, it made me sleepy.\"\n\n\"Oh really? Do you want me to be dramatic and captivating, so you can't resist?\"\n\n\"Not to that extent, but yesterday, as soon as I heard you finish talking with Qin Shu, and since I already knew this information, I fell asleep. Anything else I don't know, you can tell me again tonight.\"\n\n\"You're getting spoiled...\" Shen Lingdong got out of bed and walked towards the bathroom.\n\n\"Shen Lingdong!\" Gu Caiwei shouted from the other end of the phone.\n\n\"Alright, let's hang up for now. I need to charge my phone. I'll go check out the other grain and oil stores later.\"\n\n\"Okay, bye.\"\n\nAfter Gu Caiwei hung up, Shen Lingdong finished his morning routine, charged his phone for a while, and then glanced at his father's notebook. He began his investigation according to the serial numbers.\n\nThere were a total of eight grain and oil stores. He had investigated three yesterday. The remaining five were all closed.\n\nInvestigating them directly was impossible, so he would have to question residents near the grain and oil stores.\n\nShen Lingdong first went to the site of the Xingfu Grain and Oil Store, which had now been converted into a barbershop.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and then walked in.\n\n\"Looking for a haircut?\" asked a stylishly dressed stylist, Tony.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"Just a trim.\"\n\n\"Sure, let's start with a wash.\"\n\nWhile getting his hair cut, the stylist asked Shen Lingdong, \"First time here?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and replied, \"First time. How long have you been working here?\"\n\n\"Four or five years.\"\n\n\"Wasn't this place a grain and oil store before?\" Shen Lingdong continued to ask.\n\n\"Ah... yes!\" the stylist recalled.\n\n\"Did you rent or buy this shop?\"\n\n\"Bought it,\" the stylist said. \"It was quite cheap back then. It seems the previous owner was in a hurry for something and needed money quickly. I was lucky to pass by and saw the owner posting a notice about transferring the business. I negotiated with him directly.\"\n\n\"Do you remember the owner's name?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't remember that. He was about my age, in his thirties, I think. Are you looking for him for something?\"\n\n\"No, just asking casually.\"\n\nThe stylist smiled slightly and said, \"You're not asking casually. There must be something. After all this time, why are you looking for him?\"\n\nWhile saying this, the stylist played with Shen Lingdong's hair, examining it closely.\n\n\"You look a bit familiar...\"\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, the stylist suddenly exclaimed, \"You're that... that Special Scene Cleaner!\"\n\nShen Lingdong turned to look at the stylist and said, \"Am I that famous now?\"\n\n\"Of course! I'm a fan of yours. I often see your videos. I heard you've cracked several cases in Dongjiang City. They privately call you the Special Scene Cleaner, and some call you the Folk Detective. Why are you in our city, Nanjang?\"\n\nSuddenly, the stylist reacted, looked at his shop, and said, \"You've been asking about this place... Could it be that there was a murder here before?\" The stylist paused for a moment and then continued, \"No wonder it was sold urgently at a low price.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly said, \"No, as far as I know, there hasn't been a murder here yet.\"\n\n\"But it's not impossible, right...\"\n\nThe stylist's remark completely stumped Shen Lingdong, leaving him at a loss for words.\n\nAfter a long pause, he finally spoke, \"That's true. According to your logic, any place could have had a murder.\"\n\n\"That's also true, but just to be safe, I'll go get a charm.\" the stylist said.\n\n\"You should finish cutting my hair first,\" Shen Lingdong urged.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nShen Lingdong also inquired about the owner's name. Although the stylist didn't remember it, a contract was signed when purchasing the property, and the owner's name would be on it. The stylist promised Shen Lingdong that he would check if the contract was still there when he got back.\n\nAs for information about the grain and oil store, the stylist didn't know much.\n\nShen Lingdong had to find other ways.\n\nAfter finishing his haircut, as Shen Lingdong was about to pay, the stylist waved his hand and said, \"No need to pay. Can I get a photo with you?\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback and said, \"A photo with me?\"\n\n\"My son would be so happy if he knew you got a haircut here. How about you sign an autograph for him?\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed and said, \"Let's go with a photo. An autograph really isn't necessary.\"\n\n\"Sure!\"\n\nThe stylist quickly took out his phone, placed it on the counter, set the self-timer, then quickly came to Shen Lingdong's side, put one arm on Shen Lingdong's shoulder, and prepared to shake Shen Lingdong's hand with the other.\n\nThis action surprised Shen Lingdong.\n\nIt seemed like it had been a long time since he had shaken anyone's hand...",

    "title": "Chapter 144 Little Episode",
    "content": "Chapter 144: A Minor Interruption\n\nAfter leaving the barbershop, Shen Lingdong surveyed his surroundings before heading into a nearby residential complex. Due to the weather, there weren't many people outside. Shen Lingdong waited for some time but didn't see anyone in the complex. After a moment of hesitation, Shen Lingdong checked for nearby markets and headed there.\n\nWith only a few days left until the New Year, many people would be shopping for holiday goods. He might even run into someone from the nearby complex and could casually inquire about the \"Happy Grain and Oil Store\" from them. If someone had chosen to return goods when his father delivered them, perhaps only his father knew the situation at the time. Since his father wouldn't speak up, this clue could only be investigated through elimination.\n\nWhile waiting, Shen Lingdong received the contract from the barber. The person who signed the contract with him was Lu Shitu. The contract was dated July 9th, the day after the Xue Ru murder. Seeing that the grain and oil store was indeed related to the Happy Nursing Home, Shen Lingdong hesitated slightly before walking into the market. It was too cold outside.\n\nThe market was warmer and quite crowded, mostly concentrated in the meat section. Shen Lingdong browsed, bought some fruit, and then headed to the meat section, looking for an elderly person buying a lot of groceries so he could help them carry their bags and gather some information.\n\nSoon, Shen Lingdong spotted an elderly man who had clearly had a successful shopping trip, with chicken, duck, fish, and pork, and a bag of vegetables in his other hand. Shen Lingdong approached and asked the man, \"Grandpa, you've bought so much!\"\n\n\"It's cheap today, so I bought extra. You should hurry and buy some too, young man. If you're late, there won't be any left.\"\n\n\"Grandpa, where do you live? Is it far?\"\n\n\"I heard it was cheap here, so I took three bus transfers to come here and buy.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was a little disappointed, thinking the man probably wouldn't know anything about the grain and oil store. He then said slowly, \"Well, Grandpa, take care on your way.\" He wanted to help the man but couldn't, so the man would have to make the journey himself.\n\nAfter waiting a while longer, Shen Lingdong encountered an elderly woman. He used the same approach to ask her questions. Upon learning that the woman lived in the nearby complex, Shen Lingdong said, \"It's on my way, why don't I help you carry them?\"\n\nThe woman looked at Shen Lingdong warily. Based on his appearance, she felt he could be trusted. After a slight hesitation, she handed her shopping bags to Shen Lingdong. Shen Lingdong took the bags and said to the woman, \"I used to live in Wanhua Complex. I just got a haircut at the barbershop next door.\"\n\n\"Oh, really? I used to live in that complex too. I moved out last year. I lived on the fifth floor, and going up and down was a bit inconvenient, so I bought a ground-floor unit nearby.\"\n\n\"Yes, I haven't been back in a long time. I feel like a lot has changed. I remember there used to be a grain and oil store, but it's gone now.\"\n\n\"Oh, that grain and oil store. It closed down a few years ago. They were selling things at a low price back then, and we all stocked up on a lot of rice and flour. I'm still eating the salt I bought from them.\" the woman said.\n\n\"Won't it be expired?\"\n\nThe woman laughed, \"You silly kid, how can salt expire? As long as the bag isn't opened and it doesn't get damp, it's fine.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh.\" Shen Lingdong responded softly and continued, \"How many bags of salt did you stock up on? Was there enough of their salt for everyone to grab?\"\n\n\"Everyone I know grabbed over twenty bags. I grabbed over thirty bags. I just finished the salt I grabbed back in '09, and now I've bought a whole new bunch. I couldn't help it, it was too cheap.\"\n\n\"Did something happen to their store to make them do that, even selling the shop?\"\n\nThe woman thought back slightly and said, \"I don't really know, but some people said they might be moving to Dongjiang City and don't plan to do the grain and oil business anymore.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and said, \"That seems unlikely. Selling off inventory and selling the property, and being in such a hurry. Something urgent might have happened. Maybe they were threatened the day before.\"\n\nThe woman thought back again and said, \"I don't recall hearing about them having any conflicts with anyone.\" After a slight pause, she added, \"Oh, right, I just remembered something. On the day they were clearing out their stock, someone came to deliver goods. But when that person saw they had already started selling everything off, they didn't make the delivery and left directly.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Shen Lingdong responded softly. It seemed the goods weren't returned; rather, his father saw that they were already clearing out their stock and didn't have the other party accept the delivery. In that case, the bag of salt was indeed what they had ordered. However, they had always sold salt in small, individually packaged bags. Why would they order a large bag of bulk salt? Was it prepared for Xue Ru?\n\nShen Lingdong fell into thought and stopped speaking. He had also obtained another piece of information: the liquidation sale began before the murder. This meant they were planning to flee before they had even confirmed whether they could kill the victim. But wouldn't that leave a trail? If the police investigated even slightly, they could find them. They wouldn't even need to investigate; just his father's testimony would be enough. Why were they so confident that his father wouldn't reveal this?\n\nAfter dropping the woman off at her home, Shen Lingdong also left. To be more certain, Shen Lingdong decided to visit a few other places, hoping for other discoveries. As he was leaving, Shen Lingdong saw the same elderly man from earlier waiting at the bus stop. Shen Lingdong pulled his car over and said to the man, \"Grandpa, you're still here?\"\n\nThe man looked and said, \"Young man, is that you?\"\n\n\"Grandpa, get in, I'll give you a ride.\"\n\n\"No, no, the bus will be here soon.\" The man waved his hand and refused. Shen Lingdong immediately got out of the car and continued to invite the man, who then got into the car.\n\nAfter learning the man's address, Shen Lingdong checked the map and found that a grain and oil store was near his home. Shen Lingdong then said, \"It's on the way. I used to live in that area too, and I only returned a few years ago. I found that a lot has changed. I remember there used to be a grain and oil store, but it's gone now...\"\n\nThe man replied, \"En.\"\n\nFaced with the man's simple reply, Shen Lingdong didn't know what to say. After some awkward small talk, he didn't get any information. Shen Lingdong then went to a few other places but found nothing. Now, it could be basically concluded that it was the Happy Grain and Oil Store that had not accepted the bag of salt at the time. This led to the bag of salt ultimately being used on the deceased.\n\nAfter running around all day, he found a hotel in a small alley nearby and checked in. It was a simple hotel with only a surveillance camera at the front desk. Fortunately, there was hot water. Shen Lingdong was too lazy to walk anymore, so he settled in.\n\nAfter a hot shower, Shen Lingdong lay on the bed, reviewing all the case clues again.\n\n1. Xue Ru opened a guesthouse to code with her author friends.\n2. The guesthouse had a hidden basement, and Xue Ru bought items like a raincoat.\n3. Someone contacted Xue Ru, planning to shoot a promotional video for the guesthouse. Xue Ru agreed to meet at a coffee shop and pay for herself.\n4. Someone used Xue Ru's phone to call his father and order a large bag of salt.\n5. The bag of salt originally belonged to the Happy Grain and Oil Store, but because they were clearing out inventory, the store did not accept the salt. This bag of salt happened to be delivered to Xue Ru.\n6. The deceased made some arrangements with her family before she was killed.\n7. His father went out twice to buy cigarettes.\n8. Bloodstains were found on his father's clothes.\n9. After the incident, his father communicated with Qin Shu, stating that only by imprisoning his father could the real killer be caught.\n10. The grain and oil store was related to Lu Shitu, and Lu Shitu's Happy Picking Garden was located near Xue Ru's guesthouse.\n\nThe current clues seemed to point only to Lu Shitu. However, he had been the richest man for ten years and engaged in various charitable activities. What was his motive? Did he have a family member who was wrongly imprisoned, leading him to consider social revenge? But how could such a person be a philanthropist, doing things for the good of society?\n\nShen Lingdong pondered it endlessly but couldn't figure it out, so he gave up. For the moment, he had run out of ideas. Shen Lingdong felt that his investigation in Nanjiang City might also come to an end here.\n\nAround 8 PM, Gu Caiwei sent Shen Lingdong the organized information, and they started a video call again, working online. However, the soundproofing in the house was poor. The loud snoring of a man in the next room, which occurred at crucial moments, interrupted Shen Lingdong's train of thought.\n\nHe glanced at the document but found no particular clues. He then closed the document and chatted with Gu Caiwei. At 10 PM, Shen Lingdong heard an argument downstairs. Shen Lingdong went down to check. While a middle-aged man was taking a shower, his phone disappeared. He asked the owner to check the surveillance footage, but the owner refused. The two started arguing.\n\nShen Lingdong went downstairs, lent his phone to the man, and dialed his own phone. The phone rang within the hotel. However, after a moment, it stopped. When he called again, it indicated that the phone was turned off. Clearly, someone had taken the middle-aged man's phone. The sound was very brief, only indicating that the phone rang on the second floor. Shen Lingdong didn't know where it came from, so he suggested calling the police.\n\nHowever, the owner refused. Because it was an unlicensed hotel without proper procedures, the police would surely punish him if they came. Therefore, he could help the middle-aged man find his phone. Anyway, including himself, there were only five people in the hotel, so finding it wouldn't be difficult.\n\nThe middle-aged man returned the phone to Shen Lingdong. Shen Lingdong took the phone. To save the middle-aged man's face, Shen Lingdong put his hand behind his back and lightly wiped the screen. Shen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said to the middle-aged man, \"You took a shower, and then your phone was gone?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man nodded.\n\nShen Lingdong continued, \"If your phone wasn't found, what would you do?\"\n\n\"Of course, I'd call the police. My phone has very important things on it.\"\n\nAt this point, the owner quickly said, \"You can't call the police. If it's really impossible, how much is that phone? I'll pay you for it.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man then asked, \"How much can you pay?\"\n\n\"Definitely not that much. Let's discuss it.\"\n\n\"I bought that phone for five thousand yuan, and I've only used it for a few days.\"\n\nThe owner thought for a moment and then said, \"I can't pay that much, at most two thousand.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said to the owner, \"You don't need to pay anything, because his phone was never lost, it was just hidden by him. Your behavior is considered extortion. It's not too late to turn back now, or you won't get any money and will get yourself into trouble.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked at Shen Lingdong and retorted, \"Who are you?\"\n\nAt this point, the owner also looked at Shen Lingdong in confusion and said, \"That's not right. If no one operated the phone, how would it ring once and then hang up, and then when you call again, it would be turned off?\"\n\nShen Lingdong said somewhat helplessly to the owner, \"It's good to ask questions, but I'm helping you right now...\" After a slight pause, Shen Lingdong turned to the middle-aged man and said, \"You said you took a shower, and then your phone was lost. Then why are your hands still so dirty?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man immediately looked at his fingers. There was some soil under his fingernails. He then explained, \"This hotel is too dirty.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll take you to find your phone.\" Shen Lingdong then grabbed the middle-aged man's wrist. The middle-aged man tried to break free but found he couldn't. Shen Lingdong took the middle-aged man to the second floor, and the owner followed. Shen Lingdong pointed to a flower pot in the corridor and slowly said, \"Your phone is right here, isn't it?\"\n\nThe owner, not believing it, went to the flower pot and dug around in the soil. Sure enough, he found a bag containing a mobile phone.\n\n\"Is this your phone?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\nThe middle-aged man was still trying to quibble, saying, \"It must be that a thief hid the phone here while we were downstairs.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Shall I take you to the police station to analyze the soil in your fingernails and the soil in this flower pot to see if they are the same?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked at Shen Lingdong in surprise and asked, \"Who exactly are you?\"\n\n\"I'm just an ordinary person.\"\n\nThe owner asked, \"How did you manage to make the phone ring once and then hang up?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Although this is an unlicensed establishment, you still need to collect traveler information. My name and phone number are on the registration form at the front desk. Since there aren't many guests, you just needed to secretly take a photo of the registration form while checking my ID, and after returning to your room, add the number to your blacklist and set it to automatically hang up.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then handed the middle-aged man over to the hotel owner and said, \"He's all yours.\" With that, Shen Lingdong returned to his room.\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei on the other end of the phone asked, \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Someone lost their phone. I also solved a small case.\"\n\n\"Ten minutes, and you solved the case?\"",

    "content": "Chapter 145: Another Murder\n\nShen Lingdong smiled faintly and said, \"Someone falsely claimed their phone was lost, intending to extort money from this seedy motel.\"\n\nGu Caiwei, on the other end of the phone, frowned slightly upon hearing Shen Lingdong's words and questioned, \"You're not short of money, why would you stay at a seedy motel?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter. After the investigation concluded, I saw a motel nearby and went in. The environment was quite good.\"\n\n\"How good can a seedy motel's environment be? Besides, I'm not blind, I can see for myself.\"\n\n\"It had hot water for showers.\"\n\n\"Are your standards that low now? I've noticed your obsessive-compulsive disorder and germaphobia are gone sometimes.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Shen Lingdong asked doubtfully.\n\nGu Caiwei nodded, then said, \"Based on my analysis, your attention has shifted to other matters, and you no longer have the spare energy for those things.\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked at Gu Caiwei expressionlessly, then slowly said, \"From your last sentence, I only heard two words: free time.\"\n\nGu Caiwei nodded vigorously again, \"Exactly, free time.\"\n\nShen Lingdong rolled his eyes at Gu Caiwei, \"I can't be bothered with you.\"\n\nGu Caiwei then asked, \"Have you looked at the data I compiled for you?\"\n\n\"Not carefully yet.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Shen Lingdong opened the document and, after a while, said to Gu Caiwei, \"I only attended university for three years, but I solved so many cases, a total of 123? How do you remember all of them?\"\n\n\"Every time you solved a case, no matter what kind, you told me, so I recorded it all. Actually, organizing this for you was just transferring it from notebooks to the computer; it didn't take much effort.\" Gu Caiwei said with a smile.\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback and retorted, \"Did I tell you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I forgot.\"\n\nSaying that, Shen Lingdong continued to look at the recorded cases and the current status of the perpetrators. The vast majority of the true culprits were already deceased. Some were still in prison, and a very small number were currently police officers. Of course, those cases weren't particularly significant; they were mostly about lost socks, nothing important.\n\nLast time, according to Zhou Xinghuai, the owner of \"Ghostly Detectives,\" the director's goal was to undermine the credibility of the Dongjiang City police. This was because someone close to him had been wrongly imprisoned and died in prison. Everything he did was for revenge. If Qin Qin's father was framed in the Qin Qin case, then the director's target might be himself. After dropping out of school, he hadn't been involved in any cases; all the cases were solved while he was in school. If there was a problem, it must be with the cases solved during that period. Therefore, if he could check the current status of the true culprits in the cases he solved, he might find some clues. However, after reviewing them, none of them had conditions for resurrection. Regardless of whether they were in prison or not, they were all living well. It seemed unrelated to the director. What was going on?\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated for a moment and said to Gu Caiwei, \"By the way, how is Wang Jizhong doing in the aftercare team?\"\n\n\"He's doing quite well. Why do you ask all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"He always says the aftercare team is busy. I don't know what he's busy with all day...\"\n\n\"Isn't he your landlord? What's wrong with him taking leave? Moreover, he's genuinely very effective in the aftercare team. He's a good role model for the families.\"\n\nShen Lingdong sighed softly and said, \"I'm just worried that every time this matter is brought up, it's a form of harm to him. You might see him as carefree, but when we first met, he immediately talked about making money. I thought then, his daughter had only been gone for a month, and he was already talking about these things. Later, I realized he just wanted to integrate into my team and deliberately said that.\"\n\nGu Caiwei also nodded and said, \"Having him act as a spokesperson is indeed too cruel for him; he has to mention his daughter's murder every time. Do you know what he told me? He said he really enjoys working with you and even forgets that his daughter was murdered when he's busy. However, he doesn't want to forget. He can only remind himself of his daughter's memories by constantly telling his story to others.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then asked, \"How many bereaved families is the aftercare team currently responsible for?\"\n\n\"Twenty-four.\"\n\n\"Can you send me a list? I'll see if I can help you with anything.\"\n\nGu Caiwei immediately replied, \"Wait a moment, I'll send it to you now.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\nNot long after, Gu Caiwei sent Shen Lingdong a list. Shen Lingdong glanced at it and saw a few familiar names, which were from cases he had handled. However, most of the names were unfamiliar. Then, Shen Lingdong silently saved the list.\n\nAlthough there were indeed many murders in this period, there weren't as many in the previous few years. Therefore, it was possible that some of the families on this list included those from previous murder cases. Although those cases were not related to his father, they were related to salt. Shen Lingdong planned to use the name of the aftercare team to approach them. It was just a pity that it caused Gu Caiwei to make a mistake and leak case information.\n\nJust then, Gu Caiwei suddenly smiled and said, \"Are you trying to trick me?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Shen Lingdong quickly replied.\n\n\"Are you planning to use the families to get information about certain cases?\"\n\nShen Lingdong was startled.\n\nGu Caiwei then smiled again, \"Have you forgotten your identity? You are a criminal investigation consultant! As long as it doesn't involve your father's case, you can also inquire about details of other cases.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was stunned.\n\nA moment later, he quickly said to Gu Caiwei, \"For a moment just now, I actually felt a pang of guilt towards you.\"\n\n\"Do you think I wouldn't see through your little schemes?\" Gu Caiwei laughed even harder.\n\nShen Lingdong took his phone and returned to the bed, saying to Gu Caiwei, \"I can't be bothered with you, I'm going to sleep.\"\n\n\"Don't hang up the phone. I'm afraid you'll sneak out in the middle of the night to solve cases.\"\n\n\"I'm not that dedicated. But isn't it good for police officers to be a bit dedicated?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll push me. If you get up, I'll get up too.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I won't.\"\n\n\"Still, you can't hang up the phone. I need to keep an eye on you.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Shen Lingdong said with a hint of helplessness.\n\n\"I can't sleep. Why don't you tell me a bedtime case story?\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, \"If you had a child, would you tell them a mystery story at night?\"\n\n\"It's not impossible. Start cultivating them from a young age.\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said to Gu Caiwei, \"I actually just remembered one. Listen.\"\n\n\"Yes, tell me,\" Gu Caiwei's eyes revealed a hint of anticipation.\n\n\"Once upon a time, a person found Li Si's body on a park bench in a nearly deserted park. He was shot, the bullet passing through his left temple. In his left hand, he held a handgun. He was not left-handed, but because his right hand was injured and cast, it was his right hand.\n\nAfter the police investigation, the deceased committed suicide. The police then searched Li Si's clothes. In his left pocket, there were several cash bills. In his right trouser pocket were cigarettes and a lighter.\n\nHowever, Detective Zhang San suspected murder. There were water stains on the cast, and judging from the deceased's clothing, it appeared to have been put on after death. Therefore, Zhang San inferred that the killer had murdered Li Si and then put the clothes on him. Thus, Zhang San deduced that Li Si was taking a bath at the time.\n\nWhen the police went to investigate Li Si's residence, they indeed found bloodstains in the bathroom.\n\nTell me, how did Zhang San know the clothes were put on by the killer?\"\n\nGu Caiwei hesitated slightly, then said, \"The water stains on the cast?\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head slightly, then said, \"You have ten more seconds.\"\n\n\"10.\"\n\n\"9.\"\n\n\"8.\"\n\n\"7.\"\n\n\"6.\"\n\n\"5.\"\n\n\"4.\"\n\n\"3.\"\n\n\"2.\"\n\n\"1.\"\n\nAt this moment, Gu Caiwei immediately said, \"It's the cigarettes and lighter. These are commonly used items. If the deceased frequently used these two items, he wouldn't have put them in the trouser pocket of his injured hand; he would have put them on the left.\"\n\n\"Congratulations.\"\n\n\"You? Who else besides me?\"\n\n\"A young man next door. This motel isn't soundproof, and he also guessed it.\"\n\n\"Ah? Did he hear our entire conversation?\" Gu Caiwei was shocked.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded.\n\n\"Then let's not talk, hurry up and sleep.\"\n\n\"Goodnight.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then put his phone aside and lay down.\n\nThe next morning.\n\nShen Lingdong got dressed and prepared his equipment, ready to leave the motel and return to Dongjiang City. As he went downstairs, he saw the owner sleeping on the reception desk. Shen Lingdong ignored him; the room fee had been paid upon check-in.\n\nAs he walked out of the motel, Shen Lingdong turned back and returned to the reception desk, gently tapping on the counter, \"Boss, how was the person who tried to extort money dealt with last night?\"\n\nSeeing that the boss was fast asleep, Shen Lingdong tapped the counter again, increasing the force slightly. At this moment, a胖子 (pàngzi - fat person) came downstairs. The胖子 saw Shen Lingdong and immediately asked, \"Did I disturb you last night? My snoring is quite loud.\"\n\nShen Lingdong smiled and shook his head, then said, \"No.\"\n\n\"That's good. Is the boss still asleep?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then said, \"A guest last night tried to extort money. I wonder what happened later?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Shen Lingdong gently nudged the boss. The boss's body slumped forward, and a dagger was clearly protruding from his chest.\n\nShen Lingdong was shocked and immediately said to the胖子, \"Don't move, don't disturb the scene. Call the police immediately.\"\n\nThe胖子 was also startled by the situation and involuntarily took two steps back. Leaning against the wall, he quickly took out his phone and dialed the police.\n\nShen Lingdong felt around his backpack and took out a recording device, turned it on, and attached it to his chest. Then, without disturbing the scene, he surveyed the situation.\n\nOnly three guests remained in the motel: the胖子, Shen Lingdong, and the young man who had been eavesdropping on his bedtime story with Gu Caiwei the previous night. Shortly after the body was discovered, he also came downstairs, equally startled.\n\nThe胖子 was named Du Yi, and the slender young man was named Sun Tiehua. Du Yi was on his way back to his hometown to catch the seven o'clock train. Sun Tiehua was a salesman. Like Shen Lingdong, he was from Dongjiang City. He had come to Nanjiang City to negotiate a business deal.\n\nShen Lingdong also conducted a preliminary examination of the body. There were multiple wounds, and he died from excessive blood loss. The estimated time of death was around 10 p.m. last night, precisely when Shen Lingdong was about to go to sleep. Shen Lingdong had been video calling Gu Caiwei at the time, providing him with a solid alibi. The胖子's snoring was deafening, and Sun Tiehua was eavesdropping on him at the time. All three seemed to have alibis. So, it could only be the person who tried to extort money, but his whereabouts were unknown.\n\nA while later, a group of police officers appeared at the scene and immediately cordoned it off. They then began questioning everyone. Shen Lingdong walked forward and handed the recording device on his chest to a leading police officer, saying, \"This is what I investigated before you arrived.\"\n\nThe leading middle-aged man looked at Shen Lingdong and asked, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm also a guest here. There were five people in the motel last night, including the boss. Later, a small incident occurred, and the remaining person's whereabouts are unknown.\"\n\n\"In a moment, you all will report what you know to us. There must be no omissions.\" As he spoke, the middle-aged man looked up at the camera above the reception desk and signaled his subordinates to check the surveillance. A police officer immediately stepped forward to examine it and then said to the middle-aged policeman, \"Chief, this surveillance camera is broken.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned and said, \"No wonder the boss adamantly refused to check the surveillance last night. So it was broken.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" the middle-aged policeman immediately asked.\n\n\"Last night, I was video calling someone in my room when I suddenly heard an argument downstairs. I went down to check, and I found that a customer's phone was lost, and he was demanding to check the surveillance. The boss refused, and they started arguing. Later, I helped resolve the matter. It turned out that the customer had hidden his own phone, planning to extort money from the boss because it was a seedy establishment.\"\n\n\"Later, I returned to my room to continue my video call with my friend. The deceased likely died around 10 o'clock. At that time, I could hear Du Yi snoring, and Sun Tiehua was eavesdropping on me talking to my friend.\"\n\nSun Tiehua quickly shook his head and said, \"I wasn't eavesdropping on you talking to your girlfriend. This place isn't soundproof; I didn't want to listen, but it forced its way into my ears. Also, officer, I think this person is quite suspicious. He and his girlfriend are not entirely normal. To lull someone to sleep, they have to tell a bedtime case story.\"\n\nThe middle-aged policeman then looked at Shen Lingdong and asked, \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Shen Lingdong,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\nThe middle-aged policeman didn't think much of it. However, the younger police officers nearby suddenly stopped what they were doing and looked at Shen Lingdong in surprise, murmuring, \"Special Scene Cleaner...\"",

    "content": "\"Special Scene Cleaner\"\n\nThe middle-aged detective knew little about things online and was unaware of Shen Lingdong.\n\nHe then looked at the policeman beside him, full of confusion, and asked, \"What is a special scene cleaner? What's the connection to the Special Scene Aftercare Team?\"\n\nHe had heard that Dongjiang City had established a special scene cleanup team, which had been quite effective and was currently planning to be promoted throughout the province. Nanjiang City's Aftercare Team was also in the process of being formed.\n\nA police officer then explained, \"They are members of the cleanup team within the special scene cleanup initiative. Shen Lingdong is one of the more famous ones. He has assisted the police in solving multiple murder cases. It's said that on several occasions, while cleaning the scene, he solved cases based on traces left at the crime scene. It's truly amazing.\"\n\nThe middle-aged detective scoffed, \"What's so amazing about that? It's probably just netizens exaggerating.\"\n\nThe officer immediately added, \"Not only that, but I heard he's now a criminal investigation consultant for the Dongjiang City Criminal Investigation Team.\"\n\nThe middle-aged detective was shocked, \"This...\"\n\nAlthough they weren't in the same city, he was only the captain of a branch precinct's criminal investigation brigade, while this person was a consultant for the city bureau's criminal investigation team. At his level, it would be difficult to even join the city bureau. For someone so young to become a city bureau consultant, they either had connections or genuine ability.\n\nHowever, regardless of the situation, he didn't want to cause trouble.\n\nThe middle-aged detective quickly put on a smile and said, \"Brother Lingdong, do you have any thoughts on this case?\"\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then said, \"Although I don't know how the boss will handle the matter of him and the person who extorted him, I estimate it will likely be dropped. The boss wouldn't want to stir up trouble. This is because I didn't see anyone leave the inn.\"\n\n\"You could see downstairs?\"\n\n\"I could see part of it, but this main door, every time it's opened, it makes a creaking sound. It can wake you up even if you're asleep.\"\n\nAt this moment, Sun Tiehua chimed in, \"Indeed.\"\n\nThe middle-aged detective immediately asked, \"Where is that person? Are they still in the inn?\"\n\n\"Probably, the first room on the second floor.\"\n\nThe middle-aged detective quickly instructed another officer, \"Go up and check.\"\n\nThe officer hurried upstairs and returned to the middle-aged detective a moment later, saying, \"Captain, there's no one in that room.\"\n\nShen Lingdong frowned, seeing another officer arrive.\n\n\"Captain Song, the victim's identity has been found. The victim is Tang Hai. He has a nephew who is a police officer in Dongjiang City.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly taken aback and immediately asked, \"Is his nephew named Tang Feng?\"\n\nThe officer nodded.\n\nCaptain Song looked at Shen Lingdong and casually asked, \"Do you know him?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and said, \"Classmate.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Captain Song replied softly and continued to ask the officer, \"Any other clues?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"We found Tang Hai's case file in the system. Last night at 10:13 PM, two people came to the police station. Tang Hai claimed Wu Bo extorted him. The incident arose because Wu Bo's phone was lost. Wu Bo is a repeat offender who has been extorting people using this method for years. He has currently been detained by the police.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was slightly stunned and then said, \"The victim's time of death was likely between ten and eleven o'clock.\"\n\nCaptain Song, with a hint of confusion, countered, \"Then, by that logic, the killer isn't Wu Bo. Also, all of you have alibis...\"\n\nShen Lingdong looked up at Du Yi and Sun Tiehua, then said, \"This is my word against theirs. To be safe, you should also investigate my alibi.\"\n\nCaptain Song's expression showed a hint of difficulty. \"Is that okay?\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then said, \"The victim is Tang Feng's uncle. Even if he needs to avoid suspicion, he would still try to participate in the investigation.\"\n\n\"That's great. If the two of you work together, this case will likely be solved quickly.\"\n\nShen Lingdong gave a wry smile and remained silent.\n\nCaptain Song then said to Shen Lingdong, \"Do you need me to assign you two team members? It would be more convenient for your investigation.\"\n\nShen Lingdong quickly said, \"No... ah, wait, yes, but can I have a regular police officer from a precinct?\"\n\n\"Sure, I'll help you get someone.\"\n\n\"Li Kai from the Minghua Street Precinct in Dong'an District.\"\n\n\"Okay, no problem,\" Captain Song replied, then turned to the officer beside him and asked, \"Do you know him?\"\n\nThe officer shook his head.\n\nLi Kai was also Shen Lingdong's university classmate, one of the few classmates with whom Shen Lingdong had a relatively good relationship.\n\nDuring university, Shen Lingdong often participated in various cases or hung out with Gu Caiwei, essentially not maintaining friendships with other classmates. Furthermore, because he often stood out, it was inevitable that others would be jealous.\n\nLi Kai was different. He would often seek advice from Shen Lingdong, and over time, they became good friends.\n\nAlthough Li Kai never explicitly stated his desire to become a criminal investigator, Shen Lingdong had seen during university that he wanted to be a criminal investigator in the future. It was just that he wasn't very lucky; after graduation, he was assigned to work at a precinct.\n\n\"You still need one more,\" Captain Song reminded Shen Lingdong.\n\n\"Then it depends on whether Li Kai wants to bring someone along,\" Shen Lingdong said.\n\n\"Alright. I'll contact them now.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nCaptain Song quickly said, \"You're assisting us in solving the case, so we should be thanking you. After all, your salary is still paid by Dongjiang City, hahahaha.\"\n\nShen Lingdong echoed his laughter and then went to the main door. He pushed the door, and as soon as he did, it let out a sharp creaking sound.\n\nAll eyes in the scene focused on Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong felt a bit embarrassed and quickly smiled to ease the awkwardness.\n\nThe main door was indeed broken; it would make a noise whenever it was moved. However, he hadn't seemed to hear this sound at all, which made him think Tang Hai wouldn't pursue the matter with Wu Bo.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Tang Hai, due to operating his inn without a license, would be very wary of such things. However, with the connection to Tang Feng, he could either be more audacious or even more low-key. If something happened, it could also affect Tang Feng's career.\n\nHowever, Tang Hai chose to report it to the police.\n\nThis made Shen Lingdong a bit perplexed.\n\nMore importantly, when did they leave?\n\nShen Lingdong checked the nearby police station; it was only a few minutes away from the inn, and to leave, they had to use the road in front.\n\nHowever, Shen Lingdong could see anyone passing by that road.\n\nEven though he was chatting with Gu Caiwei, he was also curious if Tang Hai would go to the police, so he kept an eye on the road ahead. He saw no one leave before he went to sleep.\n\nAlso.\n\nThere weren't many people in the inn. If Wu Bo had been taken to the police station by Tang Hai at that time, he wouldn't have been able to commit the crime. Therefore, the killer would be between Du Yi and Sun Tiehua.\n\nHowever, both of them seemed to have alibis that prevented them from committing the crime, and alibis that he could verify.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly, then suddenly thought of something.\n\nDu Yi was a suspect.\n\nAlthough he had been snoring, sometimes loudly, sometimes softly, and occasionally pausing, which seemed normal at the time, upon reflection, Shen Lingdong thought of a possibility.\n\nDu Yi was pretending to snore while awake. Even if he left the room, he could maintain that sound.\n\nTherefore, the snoring sound would also vary in intensity.\n\nMoreover, Du Yi's room was at the end of the second floor, closest to the stairs. Even if he left the room, the sound would have come from that general direction. With some additional noise interference, it would be very difficult to detect that he had left the room.\n\nShen Lingdong hesitated slightly and then walked upstairs.\n\nSeeing Shen Lingdong go upstairs, Captain Song immediately dispatched two officers to follow him.\n\nWhen Shen Lingdong reached the second floor and was about to open a door, the two officers caught up. Shen Lingdong then said, \"It's okay, I'm just coming up to take a look.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain Song asked me to help you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Shen Lingdong nodded, then pushed open the door and went inside.\n\nThe room was very neat, with the comforter neatly folded and placed on the bed.\n\nShen Lingdong examined the outside of the comforter but found nothing unusual. He then said to the officer, \"Did you bring a camera?\"\n\nThe officer immediately shook his head and quickly said, \"I'll go down and get it.\"\n\nSaying that, the officer hurried back downstairs.\n\nSoon after, he returned to the second floor, to Du Yi's room, with a camera. He asked again, \"What should I photograph?\"\n\n\"The bed, the comforter,\" Shen Lingdong said, inwardly guessing that the other person was likely a rookie.\n\nHowever, even a rookie wouldn't usually ask such a question. During school, the teacher had said that when taking photographs, there was a situation where you photograph wherever the superior directs.\n\nThe officer then proceeded to take pictures of the bed and the comforter.\n\n\"Are you finished?\" Seeing the officer stop, Shen Lingdong quickly asked.\n\nThe officer nodded.\n\n\"Then I'm going to open the comforter.\"\n\nSaying that, Shen Lingdong opened the comforter, spread it flat on the bed, examined it carefully, and then smelled it.\n\nHe then checked the pillow.\n\nAfter a thorough examination, Shen Lingdong found a hair under the bedsheet. He handed it to the other officer and instructed, \"When we get back, test this hair to see if its DNA matches Du Yi's.\"\n\nAt this, the officer asked, \"What can this prove?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"If this hair does not belong to Du Yi, and no other information is found on the comforter, it means he didn't sleep in the bed at all. Then his snoring was fake, and he is very likely the killer.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"However, from what I can see now, it seems no one has actually stayed in this bed,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"So, is Du Yi the killer?\" the officer asked.\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head, \"Not yet determined. We're just starting the investigation. However, we can question Du Yi first. If Wu Bo killed Tang Hai, he had a motive. As for the other two, I can't think of any motive they might have.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then examined the bathroom and retrieved another hair and some dirt from the floor drain, handing them to the officer beside him.\n\nAfter looking around and confirming that there was nothing else he needed to know for the time being, Shen Lingdong headed downstairs.\n\nHe approached Du Yi and asked, \"Can I borrow your phone for a moment?\"\n\nDu Yi quickly took out his phone and handed it to Shen Lingdong. Shen Lingdong glanced at it and then returned the phone to Du Yi.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Du Yi asked.\n\nShen Lingdong then asked, \"What did you do before you went to sleep last night?\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Du Yi recalled for a moment, then said, \"I checked into the inn around seven o'clock yesterday. After returning to my room, I found I could shower, so I took a shower, then played on my phone for a while. Not long after, I got tired and went to sleep.\"\n\nShen Lingdong continued to ask, \"What were you doing on your phone at the time?\"\n\n\"Scrolling through short videos. Then I fell asleep listening to the sound.\"\n\n\"Was your phone charging at the time?\"\n\nDu Yi shook his head and said, \"I just went to sleep.\"\n\n\"So, the phone was still in use, and it still had eighty percent battery life when you woke up this morning?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\n\"No, I found the phone had no power when I woke up in the morning and then charged it.\"\n\n\"What time do you usually wake up?\"\n\n\"Around eight o'clock.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, then said, \"I must admire your biological clock; you can wake up that early without an alarm.\"\n\nDu Yi frowned slightly and then retorted, \"You suspect me of killing the boss?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Everyone in this inn is a suspect. You might suspect me, so do you have any questions for me?\"\n\n\"You were video-calling with a friend at the time. Who knows if you weren't colluding with your friend?\" Du Yi immediately retorted.\n\nJust then, Captain Song interjected, \"The person you were talking to is also a police officer.\"\n\nCaptain Song had been observing Shen Lingdong. While Shen Lingdong was upstairs, Captain Song had gathered some information about him, including watching some videos online. From the videos, he did seem capable, but he also wanted to personally observe Shen Lingdong's abilities.\n\nHowever, upon hearing Du Yi's question to Shen Lingdong, he couldn't help but answer.\n\nShen Lingdong said to Du Yi, \"If your answers are all in order, then you are cleared of suspicion. Although I am a criminal investigation consultant, I am also capable of committing the crime, so feel free to ask any questions you have about any doubts.\"\n\nDu Yi hesitated slightly and then said, \"After checking in last night, only you and Wu Bo saw Wu Bo. We don't know what conflicts arose during that time. Perhaps that's why you chose to kill the boss. Also, as a criminal investigation consultant, why would you choose a place with such lodging conditions?\"\n\n\"You might not believe it, but I'm broke,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.",

    "content": "Chapter 147: I'm Always Suspected\n\nAt this time, Captain Song interjected, \"You two are both suspects, so stop interrogating each other. Also, Sun Tiehua, I'll need the three of you to come to the police station to give statements later. If there are no issues, you can leave.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then went to Sun Tiehua's side and asked softly, \"What are your thoughts?\"\n\nSun Tiehua was startled and quickly said, \"Why are you asking me this?\"\n\n\"Don't you enjoy deduction?\" Shen Lingdong asked.\n\nSun Tiehua smiled awkwardly and said, \"I usually just enjoy playing games like 'Script Murder,' it's just a hobby. How dare I show off in front of you?\"\n\nJust then, a young police officer appeared at the entrance of the motel.\n\nThe officer greeted Captain Song and asked, \"Captain Song, did you call for me?\"\n\nCaptain Song turned his head, glanced at him, and asked, \"You're Li Kai, right? It's not me who called for you, he did.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he looked at Shen Lingdong, who was squatting on the ground looking at the body not far away.\n\nLi Kai frowned and followed Captain Song's gaze, saying, \"Shen Lingdong!\"\n\nSeeing Li Kai appear, Shen Lingdong smiled slightly and said, \"You're here. I'll borrow you for a day to investigate this case together.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Li Kai seemed disbelieving.\n\nShen Lingdong nodded and then walked to Li Kai's side, saying, \"En, you're not willing.\"\n\n\"Of course, I am.\"\n\nSaying that, Li Kai walked to Shen Lingdong's side and asked, \"What do you need me to do?\"\n\n\"Improvise,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"With you here, what else do I need to do?\"\n\n\"What do you mean? You're also very good at some things, alright,\" Shen Lingdong immediately retorted.\n\nLi Kai turned to look at Captain Song and said, \"Then Captain Song, I...\"\n\nCaptain Song nodded and said, \"What do you want to do?\"\n\n\"I want to know the details of the case.\"\n\nAt this moment, Shen Lingdong slowly spoke, \"I was at the scene the whole time, so I'll be the one to recount it.\"\n\nThen, Shen Lingdong told Li Kai everything he knew.\n\nAfter listening to the details of the case, Li Kai hesitated for a moment and then said, \"I want to bring Wu Bo to the scene first. I want to conduct a case reenactment.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll make the arrangements.\"\n\nAbout an hour later, Wu Bo was brought back to the scene.\n\nAll the scene investigations were completed, and most of the police officers had returned to the Criminal Investigation Team. Only a small number of police officers remained at the scene.\n\nShen Lingdong glanced at Wu Bo and then said to Li Kai, \"At that time, it was just us few people in the motel, along with the deceased owner.\"\n\nLi Kai then took out several Bluetooth headsets and handed them to Shen Lingdong, Du Yi, Sun Tiehua, and Wu Bo. He asked everyone to recall what they did the previous night and said that he would transmit time cues through the Bluetooth headsets. At the designated times, everyone just needed to react accordingly.\n\nAt this point, Captain Song raised a question, \"Can't we just get their statements?\"\n\nLi Kai immediately said, \"There's no surveillance here, so we need to re-shoot. If the murderer is among these four people, their reactions will definitely be different from before, and some things will be unreasonable.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" Captain Song replied softly, then looked at the four people in front of him and asked doubtfully, \"But the owner is missing?\"\n\nHe scanned the remaining police officers and then said, \"Then I'll trouble Captain Song to play Tang Hai.\"\n\nCaptain Song frowned slightly, clearly unwilling to cooperate with Li Kai in this manner. However, since Shen Lingdong had specifically requested him, and in order to solve the case quickly, he reluctantly nodded.\n\nLi Kai then handed a piece of paper to Captain Song and said, \"This is Tang Hai's behavior and speech that I've compiled based on Shen Lingdong's and Wu Bo's statements. Just cooperate with them.\"\n\nShen Lingdong was also a bit unwilling to do this, as re-enacting the \"small case before sleep\" was quite embarrassing.\n\nSoon, the group quickly reenacted the events of the previous day.\n\nThe others were fine, either playing on their phones or sleeping.\n\nOnly Shen Lingdong was talking to himself on his phone.\n\nIn a blink of an eye, there was a quarrel downstairs. Shen Lingdong also received instructions from Li Kai to go downstairs and deal with the dispute between two people, and then return to the room.\n\nAfter talking to himself for a while longer, it was time for the \"small case before sleep.\"\n\nAfter Shen Lingdong finished his countdown, Sun Tiehua's voice rang out from beside the wall.\n\nNot long after, Li Kai called a halt to the reenactment. The others remained in the room, while Shen Lingdong went from the room to the floor below.\n\nThere was a problem with Wu Bo and Tang Hai.\n\nAccording to Wu Bo's statement, Tang Hai was taking him to the police station at the time. However, according to the forensic doctor's examination results, Tang Hai was already dead at that time and could not have taken Wu Bo to the police station to report the crime.\n\nEither the forensic doctor's examination results were incorrect, or Wu Bo's statement was problematic.\n\n\"Did you find anything?\"\n\nCaptain Song came to Li Kai's side and asked.\n\nLi Kai then said, \"Let me talk about each person first. First, Du Yi. Before he entered the room, I placed a speaker in his room. Since he was snoring the entire time, to save trouble, he could have recorded himself snoring and played it on repeat. I also told him to find some simple methods. In the footage we filmed, he saw the speaker on the table, but he didn't use it. Therefore, one possible reason I deduced is that he used a similar method the previous night, but to avoid suspicion, he didn't use the speaker.\"\n\n\"Also, Sun Tiehua, when he could clearly hear the sounds from the adjacent room, he was initially agitated. Only after being intrigued by their conversation did he start eavesdropping. Unless you have some special fetish, Captain Song has checked the motel's records, and you visit this motel an average of three times a month. You know this motel has poor soundproofing, so do you have this kind of fetish?\"\n\n\"Wu Bo and the owner's situation were also very unusual. The argument ended around 9:20 PM, but the owner, Tang Hai, took Wu Bo to report the crime around 10 PM. And Wu Bo's first reaction after his scam failed was to leave the motel. If he had left the motel, Tang Hai wouldn't have taken him to the police station.\"\n\n\"Even if they went to the police station, the police would have come to the motel to question others. However, the police didn't find anyone among them, so Wu Bo voluntarily admitted to everything. Therefore, I hypothesize that Wu Bo might have wanted to be detained for a few days. For someone like him, a few days of detention is not a problem at all.\"\n\n\"So, I hypothesize that he might have known in advance that a murder would occur.\"\n\nJust then, a creaking sound came from the doorway. \"Why aren't you mentioning Shen Lingdong's suspicious behavior?\"\n\nBefore the speaker was seen, the voice was heard.\n\nThe next moment, the door curtain at the entrance was lifted, and Tang Feng walked in.\n\nLi Kai was slightly surprised upon seeing Tang Feng and quickly called out, \"Tang Feng?\"\n\nTang Feng, with a dark expression, said, \"I'm not in the mood for pleasantries. I've come back to catch the real killer who murdered my uncle, no matter who he is, even if he's a criminal investigation consultant.\"\n\nHis words directly pointed at Shen Lingdong.\n\nShen Lingdong calmly replied, \"Then you can start your deduction. If you want to know any details about the case, I can tell you anything.\"\n\n\"No need. I've already understood the details of the case on the way here. All the problems lie in the time you went downstairs to stop the argument.\"\n\n\"Shen Lingdong and Sun Tiehua's rooms are on the third floor. Sun Tiehua is close to the stairs, Du Yi is on the second floor, directly below Shen Lingdong, and Wu Bo is directly below Sun Tiehua. After he dealt with the dispute, he asked my uncle to handle the follow-up matters, but in reality, he returned to the first floor. The entire motel was quite dark, making it easy to hide.\n\nAs for his conversation with Gu Caiwei, it was fabricated. He could have used a laptop or another phone to pre-record the video. After going downstairs, he started playing the pre-recorded video. Even if there were discrepancies in lip-syncing, it wouldn't matter; he could explain it as internet lag.\n\nAfter murdering my uncle, he quietly returned to his room.\"\n\nAt this point, Captain Song quickly asked, \"But according to the forensic doctor's estimated time of death, when your uncle was murdered, he was at the police station reporting the crime, and there was surveillance video at the police station.\"\n\nTang Feng hesitated slightly and then said, \"Precise time? When forensic doctors determine the time of death, they also consider the surrounding environment. However, Shen Lingdong is also very familiar with forensic science. If he wanted to make the body's time of death earlier, he only needed to slightly increase the temperature in the room. Moreover, even with precise instruments, there is still an error of about thirty minutes, let alone the fact that Nanjang City doesn't have such instruments. Furthermore, he had already performed a preliminary autopsy and used factors like the ambient temperature to influence the forensic doctor, thus determining the time of death to be around 10 PM, making everyone believe he didn't have time to commit the crime. He could even provide an alibi for others, thereby completing the murder.\"\n\nAfter a pause, Tang Feng continued, \"I have another piece of evidence.\"\n\n\"What evidence?\" Captain Song quickly retorted.\n\nTang Feng then said, \"It's this door... This door has an old problem, and my uncle knew how to open it without making a sound. Shen Lingdong's hiding place at the time should not have allowed him to see the doorway, so he didn't know that my uncle had already opened the door and left. And that road ahead, my uncle had broken his leg there before, and he never took that road. So, he would have taken a detour to the police station. If there was a place on the first floor suitable for hiding and not seeing the doorway, I guess it would be there.\"\n\nTang Feng then looked towards a dark corner.\n\nThen, Tang Feng turned on a switch nearby and continued, \"I just saw a damaged area on the back of Shen Lingdong's down jacket. So I guess he was hiding there and it was snagged by something. Therefore, there should be fiber residue from Shen Lingdong's down jacket on that hook.\"\n\nSaying that, Tang Feng walked over.\n\nShen Lingdong then took off his down jacket and saw that there was indeed a small tear about one centimeter long on the back.\n\nA moment later, Tang Feng found a gray fiber on a splinter of broken wood, which was the same color as Shen Lingdong's down jacket.\n\nAt this point, Captain Song turned to look at Shen Lingdong and asked, \"Brother Lingdong, what's going on?\"\n\nLi Kai also looked at Shen Lingdong with confusion.\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"If I say I was investigating there and accidentally snagged it, will you believe me?\"\n\nCaptain Song showed a look of difficulty and said, \"Brother Lingdong, don't make it too difficult for me.\"\n\nTang Feng snorted coldly at this moment and said, \"Difficult? Even if we shoot him directly now and then investigate slowly, it won't be a wrongful conviction.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then looked at Wu Bo and asked, \"Were you threatened or bribed?\"\n\nCaptain Song quickly said from the side, \"Brother Lingdong, let's go to the police station first. If you are being framed, we will definitely find out the truth.\"\n\nShen Lingdong nodded, smiled slightly, and then looked at Li Kai.\n\nLi Kai immediately asked, \"Shen Lingdong, what is going on?\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"This is why I asked you to come. Investigate along Wu Bo's line. As for the killer, I'll tell them.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Shen Lingdong threw his car keys to Li Kai and then walked out with two police officers.\n\nAfter being put into the police car, Shen Lingdong began to speak to himself, \"We found Wu Bo's mobile phone in the flower pot on the second floor. When Tang Hai was digging, he accidentally spilled some soil outside. You can check Sun Tiehua's shoe soles for soil of the same composition. As for how he could talk to me and answer my questions, I haven't figured that out yet.\"\n\nThe two police officers were startled when they heard Shen Lingdong say this and quickly asked, \"Indeed, you already knew who the killer was? I knew it, how could you be the killer?\"\n\n\"I just wanted to see what tricks Tang Feng had up his sleeve. I didn't expect to be fooled by him this time. I was also afraid of doing anything rash, so I called Li Kai over,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\n\"I'll go and explain the situation to Captain Song.\"\n\nOne police officer immediately got out of the car.\n\nA moment later, the police officer returned to the police car and excitedly said to Shen Lingdong, \"We really found soil from the flower pot on Sun Tiehua's shoes.\"\n\n\"Let's go back to the team first,\" Shen Lingdong said softly.\n\nJust as one of the police officers started the car and was about to drive away, Shen Lingdong suddenly spoke, \"I just remembered something. Check if there are any similar soil traces in my room. I suspect Sun Tiehua has been to my room.\"\n\nThe police officer then asked, \"Weren't you on video at the time? If Sun Tiehua entered your room, the one who was videoing with you would definitely have noticed it.\"\n\nShen Lingdong shook his head slightly and then said, \"At that time, my phone was not pointed towards the door, so I couldn't see anything.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll go and tell them.\"\n\n...\n\nA moment later, the police officer returned and brought another piece of news: soil traces were found in Shen Lingdong's room.\n\nHowever, this made it easy for Sun Tiehua to argue, \"You have soil on your shoes too, so it's not surprising that he stepped on some mud.\"\n\nShen Lingdong then said, \"Check the doorway for any signs of glue. I suspect Sun Tiehua installed a listening device in my room. The time was when I first went downstairs. Moreover, he was the last one to come down this morning, so he should have retrieved the listening device from his room.\"",
