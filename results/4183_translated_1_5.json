    "content": "Cupping a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head and looked at his reflection in the mirror. He looked a bit haggard. As an emergency room doctor, this haggardness seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. It seems like they fell from upstairs. Not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the doorway of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there,\" Zhou Ze replied, then pulled out a tissue to dry the water droplets and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance soon arrived at the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an old man in a grey Tang suit. The old man kept coughing, occasionally spitting out blood foam and fragments of his spleen. His entire body was covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately rushed over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition. He shouted to those in front, \"Prepare the surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very poor.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We will help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients would say such things at this time. Those who can truly face death calmly are few. As a doctor, this is not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too scary...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly grabbed Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Calm down, relax. Your life is not in danger.\" Although his wrist ached, Zhou Ze did not try to break free.\n\n\"I don't want... to go down anymore... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately shouted.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were long and, for some reason, black. They were a transparent black, like amber, not like dirt accumulated within.\n\nAnd at this moment, the old man's nails had already dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down anymore... not going down... not going down... haha... cough, cough, cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat up and coughed violently. Then, his body trembled, his hand that was holding Zhou Ze fell away, and he lost all movement.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room, and doctors and nurses began resuscitation measures, while the defibrillator was also prepared.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, I'll help you tend to your wound,\" Wang Ya said as she walked over.\n\nAs doctors, they were not actually worried about this minor flesh wound. What they were most worried about was the possibility that the old man had other diseases that could put the doctors at risk of occupational exposure. After all, the old man's hands were bloody just now, and no one knew if he had any contagious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor came out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant that the person could not be saved.\n\nEveryone felt a bit dejected, but for them, this was a common occurrence, and they would quickly adjust.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let's get a check-up,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked to the locker room to change his clothes, and then drove away from the hospital parking lot.\n\nAs soon as the car drove under the Jianghai Avenue overpass, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu. A patient took some time. I'll be there right away. Please ask the children to wait a little longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The person on the other end quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze checked the time again. It was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator and drove off.\n\n\"HONK!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and sped over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head to look at the blinding high beams outside the car window,\n\nThen,\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nThe world spun.\n\nThe sedan, in front of the heavy truck, was like a delicate piece of white paper and was directly knocked flying. After tumbling several times in the air, it smashed onto the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up.\n\nHe found that his body couldn't move at all, as if it were stuck.\n\nAt the same time, he couldn't open his eyes. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he really wanted to check his injuries right now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, there were intermittent sounds of other vehicles passing by, as well as various honking noises.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of police sirens could be heard, as well as the sound of fire trucks.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze heard the familiar sound of an ambulance siren.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was slightly high, indicating they were cutting apart his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was somewhat familiar with the process.\n\nWhat a shame, the cake in my trunk, and the Children's Day party for the orphanage children, all ruined.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar call.\n\nIt should be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh in his heart. At least he had saved his life. This could be considered a sudden disaster.\n\nThere were also sounds of several nurses nearby, but because it was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, Doctor Chen's words made Zhou Ze's heart plummet to the bottom!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze shouted desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt the heavy compressions each time, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nHe hoped they would discover he wasn't dead soon!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying of a few nurses he knew.\n\nDoctor Chen punched a nearby car door, appearing deeply saddened.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nPlease don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of suspended animation now.\n\nBlood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared madly in his heart.\n\nBut next, he felt himself being lifted onto a stretcher, presumably being put into an ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, the sound of the ambulance starting was heard.\n\nThe nurses in the carriage were still crying.\n\nBut these cries were jarring to Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nHe wasn't dead yet.\n\nWhy are they crying!\n\nWhy cry!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leadership speaking:\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone just like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very serious. Doctor Zhou was severely injured and died of excessive blood loss. He has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's gone just like that?\" Another vice president didn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his leaders and elders.\n\nThey actually determined that he was dead.\n\nBut can a dead person hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nAnimals,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to be pushed. The surroundings were quiet, and the temperature was gradually decreasing.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said that the hospital will hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Su Qin, I just can't believe it. A person is just gone like that. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he be gone like this.\"\n\n\"Life is unpredictable. Try to look on the bright side.\"\n\nAfter the two nurses finished speaking, they left.\n\nAround,\n\nIt was empty.\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, desperately trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately yearned to make his voice heard.\n\nBut his current feeling was like being physically restrained in sleep. No matter how hard he tried, his body simply wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair.\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now.\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and the stinging sensation was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush. Wait. He's been smashed up like that, how can the makeup be done so quickly.\"\n\n\"The hospital is urging us. They need to send him to the mourning hall soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it.\"\n\nThe mortician seemed angry and applied more force while applying makeup. Of course, their client was a dead person. Dead people wouldn't feel pain, nor would they complain. They only needed to satisfy the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe remained there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation as the makeup brush pressed down on his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, let them in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being dressed, then he was pushed out. The hospital orderly carried him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nShould be an ice coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly isolated.\n\nThe lid should have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBouncing...\n\nAfter an unknown period of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the ice coffin should have been opened.\n\nWhat entered his ears,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe hospital director was speaking into a microphone, praising him, lamenting his passing.\n\nThen came the vice president and directors, and so on.\n\nAround,\n\nThere were intermittent sounds of footsteps.\n\nSome people just walked by quietly, taking one last look at him.\n\nSome even tried to call out his name a few times, with a sobbing voice.\n\nThis was paying respects to the deceased.\n\nPaying respects,\n\nTo my remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe began to try again,\n\nBut still couldn't.\n\nHe could only hear, and feel,\n\nBut couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes.\n\nEveryone believed he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came and cried beside him.\n\nThey cried sincerely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who had come from an orphanage. Because of this, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. The reason he was in a car accident this time was that he was rushing back to the orphanage to spend Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. You died in the line of duty this time. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation to the orphanage. Rest assured.\" The vice president stood beside Zhou Ze and said.\n\nAfterwards,\n\nZhou Ze sensed that he was being isolated again. The lid of the ice coffin should have been closed again.\n\nThen there was another series of bumps,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the ice coffin was opened again.\n\nAround, it was a bit quiet. Occasionally, human voices could be heard, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and the other holding his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold shelf, which seemed to be a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround, there were faint sounds of crying.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't figure out where he had arrived again,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood.\n\nBastards!\n\nThey sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey're going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nScrew your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou animals,\n\nMongrels!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis was the most frantic and craziest Zhou Ze had ever been.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no room for maneuver!\n\nHe would directly face death!\n\nA complete end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he was truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty years old, he hadn't gotten married, he didn't have children, he still had a life to live, he still had a long road ahead!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A slap was heard.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get back.\" The girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze was desperate.\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nNo matter how much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started.\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of it, he was terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his calls.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being upset,\n\nOnly responsible for completing the process,\n\nAnd then going home for dinner and continuing the next day.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed that he had been pushed into a narrow space filled with the smell of oil residue.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nSticky liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what it was.\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nThen,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nSevere burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere...",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

    "content": "午夜的街頭，\n\n\n\n  路燈黃黃，\n\n\n\n  人也惶惶，\n\n\n\n  天很冷，還有風，似刀子割人。\n\n\n\n  周澤也感到冷，\n\n\n\n  他不知道這裡又是哪裡，\n\n\n\n  但知道一件事，\n\n\n\n  這裡是……人間。\n\n\n\n  他已經死了，但又回來了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道自己該怎麼辦，\n\n\n\n  只能機械麻木地繼續往前走。\n\n\n\n  他現在沒有功夫去思考太多其他的事情，\n\n\n\n  比如自己剛剛下去的地方，\n\n\n\n  比如那個自己車禍前救治的老者，\n\n\n\n  比如水潭裡身穿著紅色衣裙的無面女，\n\n\n\n  比如……自己的指甲。\n\n\n\n  他回來了，本該是很喜悅的一件事，但哪怕身邊偶爾有人走過，哪怕他再用力地打招呼，也依舊沒人可以看見他和聽見他。\n\n\n\n  他被這個世界給排擠了，隔絕了。\n\n\n\n  沒嘗試過被關「禁閉」的人，不會了解那種被完全隔離的痛苦，而對於周澤來說，眼下整個世界，就是他的囚籠，囚籠上還蓋上了一層黑布。 \n\n\n\n  沒人能看見他，\n\n\n\n  也沒人能和他交流，\n\n\n\n  他拿不起任何一件有實的東西，\n\n\n\n  甚至，\n\n\n\n  連風都能夠從他身上輕而易舉地吹過去。\n\n\n\n  他是那麼的羸弱，\n\n\n\n  弱不禁風這個詞在他身上，真的是一點都不誇張。\n\n\n\n  而且，最讓周澤震驚和駭然的是，\n\n\n\n  他能看見自己身上不斷有淡淡的光點流散出去，\n\n\n\n  換言之，\n\n\n\n  他的身體正在慢慢地變淡。\n\n\n\n  可能再過個一刻鐘，自己就將徹底地消失不見，被抹去最後一絲微不足道的痕跡。\n\n\n\n  他不知道這一切到底是怎麼發生的，但他清楚，自己的時間，真的沒剩下多少了。\n\n\n\n  八仙里，鐵拐李就是以魂魄的方式進入了一位餓死倒地的人體內，才成了後世流傳那種形象。\n\n\n\n  周澤也聽說過關於鬼魂「借屍還魂」的故事，他也想去借屍還魂，他很冷，也很慌張，他需要一具肉體給自己去依附。\n\n\n\n  甚至，他不介意這個人是誰。\n\n\n\n  人在這個時候，總是自私的，周澤也不例外，而且，他是真的快受不了了。 \n\n\n\n  但是，每當他準備靠近一個人時，那個人的頭頂和雙肩位置都會出現光火，直接讓其無法靠近，甚至自己還因此受到了傷害，加劇了自己「揮發」的速度。\n\n\n\n  他有些累了，也有些麻木了，\n\n\n\n  他在等待自己的終結，\n\n\n\n  等待自己的結束。\n\n\n\n  作為一名已經死過一次的人，你讓他再面臨一次死亡，反而能夠變得更坦然了一些。\n\n\n\n  而且，以周澤現在的情況，繼續逗留在這裡，逗留得時間越久，也就是意味著他承受折磨的時間越長。\n\n\n\n  「吱呀……」\n\n\n\n  前面，有一家還亮著燈的店面，好像是一家書店，因為隔著店門玻璃可以看見裡面的一排排書架。\n\n\n\n  有人從裡面將門推開走了出來，是一名穿著衛衣的男子，男子戴著帽子，看不清楚真容，左顧右盼了一會兒，急匆匆離開了。\n\n\n\n  當然，男子是看不見距離他不到五米處所站著的周澤的。\n\n\n\n  原本，周澤沒覺得有什麼異常，但就在男子離開不久之後，周澤忽然自書店裡，感知到了一種溫暖的氣息。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  溫暖的氣息。\n\n\n\n  這種溫暖，讓周澤有些莫名其妙，但他眼下就像是一個即將凍死的人忽然得到一盒火柴一樣，哪怕知道火柴救不了自己的命但還是會劃開它讓自己在臨死前感知到最後的溫熱。 \n\n\n\n  周澤向那邊走過去，他的身體直接穿過了書店的玻璃門，繼續往裡走，來到了書店的書架後面。\n\n\n\n  書架後面，\n\n\n\n  躺著一個人，\n\n\n\n  是一個面容俊秀的年輕男子，年紀可能也就二十三四歲的樣子，因為店裡開著空調，所以他身上穿的衣服不多，也就一件長袖外加一件薄外套。\n\n\n\n  他躺在地上，但在他身上，周澤感知到了一種溫暖的感覺，就像是一個窮鬼，晚上走在路上撿了一袋子金幣。\n\n\n\n  這種吸引力，無法拒絕，而且現在的周澤，也沒資格去拒絕！\n\n\n\n  周澤走了過去，在這個年輕男子面前蹲了下來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道該如何去進入對方的身體，但他明白該如何去接觸自己所需要的溫暖。\n\n\n\n  一隻手伸出，放在對方的胸口位置，\n\n\n\n  周澤看見自己的指甲居然慢慢地嵌入到了對方的體內，\n\n\n\n  這是一種很詭異的感覺，不同於自己之前走在路上時「微風」吹過自己的身體，這是一種相融，以自己的指甲為媒介進行的一種融合。\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，周澤整個人開始進入到對方的體內，二者，開始了重合。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  「徐樂！你給我醒醒，醒醒！」 \n\n\n\n  周澤被一番推搡給吵醒，不，確切的說，是被「驚動」，他睜開眼，發現自己正坐在書店櫃檯後面，之前自己是雙手枕在上面。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你醒醒！」\n\n\n\n  女人的聲音很尖銳，很高亢，帶著一種頤氣指使。\n\n\n\n  抬起頭，周澤看著面前的女人，不，確切地說，應該是女孩兒，也就是高中生的年紀吧，雖然是大女孩兒了，卻還是有點稚氣未脫。\n\n\n\n  「喂，徐樂，你到底是什麼意思，你能耐了是吧，想給我爸媽給我姐臉色看了是吧，昨晚居然敢一宿沒回家！\n\n\n\n  誰給你的這個膽子！」\n\n\n\n  徐樂？\n\n\n\n  是誰？\n\n\n\n  周澤有些茫然地攤開手，發現自己雙手很平滑，自己以前的手可是因為長時間練習手術器械已經有了一些老繭，這雙手卻沒有。\n\n\n\n  「喂，我在和你說話呢！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒一巴掌拍在櫃檯上，氣勢洶洶。\n\n\n\n  周澤微微皺眉，站起身，走到了店門邊的玻璃鏡子前，他看見了自己的倒影，是一張陌生的臉，不，這張臉自己見過，是昨晚自己看見的那張臉。\n\n\n\n  這身體，\n\n\n\n  是我的了？\n\n\n\n  「喂，你什麼意思啊，我爸媽可都生氣了，我媽還在家裡發脾氣了呢，我告訴你啊，你現在吃的喝的用的都是我家的，你這個上門女婿有什麼資格在我家裡擺譜？ \n\n\n\n  你想做樣子給誰看啊！\n\n\n\n  你今晚再敢不回家，信不信我過來直接抽你！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒作勢揚起自己的巴掌，但她忽然發現自己面前的男子也就是自己的「姐夫」沒有像是往常一樣躲閃和求饒，反而那一雙眸子裡的意味，讓她感到有些害怕。\n\n\n\n  這時候，她看了看時間，發現已經七點半了。\n\n\n\n  「哼，我先上學去了，晚上再和你算帳！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒氣呼呼地走了。\n\n\n\n  周澤則是緩緩地坐回到了自己櫃檯後面的椅子上，這裡有一台老式筆記本，筆記本旁邊還有一部手機。\n\n\n\n  即使是現在，他依舊沒能從自己身份轉換的過程中適應過來。\n\n\n\n  他是周澤，是通城有名的年輕外科醫生，而且，他是一個孤兒，\n\n\n\n  結果，\n\n\n\n  自己眼下變成這個身份，\n\n\n\n  剛剛那個女孩兒說什麼來著？\n\n\n\n  我是……上門女婿？\n\n\n\n  有一個妻子？\n\n\n\n  還有丈母娘和丈人？\n\n\n\n  而且看自己這個小姨子剛剛自己這個「姐夫」面前說話的態度和語氣，自己這個「上門女婿」還真是符合古代的優良傳統。 \n\n\n\n  上門女婿，俗稱倒插門的，不光被妻子家裡人看不起，在古代也會被周遭所有人看不起，甚至身份和罪犯差不多，漢唐的時候那些被強迫戍邊的人裡面往往也有贅婿。\n\n\n\n  拿起手機，手機沒設置密碼，也不知道是那貨懶還是不敢設密碼，至少在這個時候讓周澤很輕鬆地打開了他的微信和QQ。\n\n\n\n  QQ列表里人很少，也就是些許初中同學，高中同學和大學同學，然後有一個家人的列表，裡面只有一個人，備註是「老婆」。\n\n\n\n  打開了和她的QQ聊天記錄，空。\n\n\n\n  好吧，\n\n\n\n  周澤打開了微信，試著找了一下，找到了備註是「老婆」的女人，這裡有回覆了，基本都是徐樂問一些事情，比如今晚吃什麼，今晚要準備做什麼，進貨需要花多少錢，最近書店賣了多少錢，你身體怎麼樣一大堆，\n\n\n\n  然後對方的回覆往往很敷衍也很高冷，\n\n\n\n  以：\n\n\n\n  「哦」\n\n\n\n  「嗯」\n\n\n\n  「好」\n\n\n\n  來代替。\n\n\n\n  周澤將手機丟一邊，這個人際關係，有點複雜了，他忽然看了一下自己的手掌，自己的指甲和常人沒什麼區別。\n\n\n\n  但自己出車禍前救治的那個老者，自己從無面女人手中脫困，自己進入這個傢伙身體等這些事情上，自己的指甲，起到了極為關鍵的作用。 \n\n\n\n  心隨意動，\n\n\n\n  就在這個時候，\n\n\n\n  周澤發現自己的指甲開始慢慢地變長，同時也變得漆黑通透起來，甚至在指甲上，還有淡淡的黑霧繚繞。\n\n\n\n  「呼…………」\n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  再睜開眼時，\n\n\n\n  指甲又恢復了正常。\n\n\n\n  一直從早上到中午，周澤都坐在那裡嘗試去適應自己的這個新身份，也在平復自己身份轉換所帶來的不適應感，中午飯都沒吃，也不知道是忘記了還是自己根本就不覺得餓。\n\n\n\n  這裡依舊還是通城，周澤以前的家在崇川區，現在則是在港閘區，距離並不遠。\n\n\n\n  到了下午時，周澤才嘆了口氣，默默地站起身，既來之則安之吧。\n\n\n\n  他開始試著打掃書架，總歸，給自己先找點事情做做。\n\n\n\n  那個死前掐過自己的老者曾說過「他被發現了」以及地獄裡無面女說過的「你遲早會被抓住」，讓周澤心裡產生了些許危機感。\n\n\n\n  他現在的狀態，算是「苟活」了，死而復生，是邀天之倖，所以他很珍惜，至少，在沒完全分清楚狀況和掌握足夠線索前，自己得代入這個身份，最好不要引起太大的異常，不要引起那些「要抓他的人」的注意。 \n\n\n\n  這家店的生意，真的很不好，傳統圖書市場的低迷，早就不是一天兩天的事兒了，而且這裡又不是在學校的大門口黃金一條街上。\n\n\n\n  只能說，那個「徐樂」選擇在這裡開一家書店，能不能保本都是一個問題。\n\n\n\n  一直到下午三點鐘的時候，才走進來今天的第一位客人。\n\n\n\n  客人在小學生讀物那邊轉悠著，且轉悠了很長時間。\n\n\n\n  周澤等了一會兒，還是走過去，問道：「選什麼題材的？」\n\n\n\n  雖然，周澤也不懂。\n\n\n\n  「隨便看看。」對方回答道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」周澤也就不再理會了，他現在還沒融入這個「書店老闆」的角色里。\n\n\n\n  但就在這時，\n\n\n\n  對方卻忽然走到了自己身後，幽幽地開口道：\n\n\n\n  「你真的不認識我了？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「昨晚我用棒球棒打了你的頭，搶了你的錢，\n\n\n\n  而且我還特意去試了一下，\n\n\n\n  你那時分明已經沒有鼻息了的。」",

    "content": "周澤愣了一下，所以說，昨晚自己之所以能拿「徐樂」這個人的身體去借屍還魂，還是因為他剛剛被殺了？\n\n\n\n  因為身子還熱乎著，所以自己才能進去？\n\n\n\n  這樣看來，自己，好像真的有些幸運了。\n\n\n\n  沒有反感，也沒有憤怒，更沒有可能被戳破身份的驚慌，周澤轉過身，看著自己身後的這位年紀和自己差不多的男子。\n\n\n\n  男子愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  他從周澤眼裡看見了不同尋常的東西，\n\n\n\n  是歡喜，\n\n\n\n  是慶幸，\n\n\n\n  甚至，\n\n\n\n  還有一點點的欣賞。\n\n\n\n  作為一個宿主，在昨晚那個情況下，周澤清楚自己面對的是何種艱難局面，如果這個傢伙沒恰巧在那個時候殺人，自己可能已經魂飛魄散了，根本見不到今天的太陽。\n\n\n\n  「抱歉，我昨晚昏過去，早上起來腦子很不舒服，像是喝醉了酒一樣，忘記了昨天的事情。」周澤隨意地解釋道。\n\n\n\n  他不認為對方會猜出來自己是鬼魂借屍還魂，除非對方腦子進水了。\n\n\n\n  「你不怪我？」對方指了指自己的鼻子，有些荒謬道，「哪怕我已經告訴你，昨天抽了你一記悶棍？」\n\n\n\n  「沒事兒，我倒是謝謝你，沒把我桌上的手機和電腦拿走。」 \n\n\n\n  「那個……是我忘了。」男子撓了撓頭，「你沒事就好，這是我昨天搶的你的錢。」\n\n\n\n  男子主動地從口袋裡拿出了三百塊，然後又掏了掏，又取出了八百塊。\n\n\n\n  「八百塊是你的醫藥費，三百是昨天搶的。」男子抿了抿嘴唇，「昨天上網賭錢把自己的工資都輸給狗莊了，路過你這書店時忽然想弄點錢花花，把你打倒之後我發現你沒鼻息了，還嚇得要死。\n\n\n\n  跑回家後一整晚沒睡著，就想著警察會不會忽然破門進來把我抓走，入室搶劫加殺人，就拿了三百塊，感覺自己真傻，真不值。」\n\n\n\n  男子伸手在周澤的肩膀上拍了拍，\n\n\n\n  「哥們兒，你沒死真好，真的，我從早上開始就在外頭轉悠了，我在等有人報警，等警察過來，結果我看見你居然還在書店裡。\n\n\n\n  你知道麼，那時候我都快跪在地上給你磕頭了，謝謝你，你命硬，沒死，不然我就完了，這裡這麼多攝像頭，要是你死了，我肯定跑不掉。」\n\n\n\n  周澤看著自己手中的一千一百塊，再看著眼前這位噙著眼淚對自己懺悔的「殺人兇手」，總覺得，這畫風很詭異。\n\n\n\n  老實說，「徐樂」是死了，因為他死了，自己才能鵲巢鳩占，而因為自己鵲巢鳩占了，眼前的這個傢伙就免去了殺人罪。\n\n\n\n  自己和眼前的這個傢伙，都獲利了，唯有那個徐樂，倒霉鬼一個。 \n\n\n\n  「行，沒事了，可能昨晚我只是岔氣了。」周澤將對方的手從自己肩膀上挪開，他以前是一名急診醫生，什麼樣的污穢沒見過？但他卻在那種極端環境下，養成了些許潔癖，事實上，大部分急診醫生都有輕重程度不一的潔癖。\n\n\n\n  正是因為見識過太多的骯髒污穢，所以才更懂得珍惜「乾淨」。\n\n\n\n  「你真的不怪我？」男子有些欣喜道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，不怪你。」周澤點點頭，「你去好好上班過日子去吧，下次別犯錯了。」\n\n\n\n  「好，謝謝你，哥們兒，你是個實在人。」\n\n\n\n  男子重重地點點頭，離開了書店，去迎接他的「新生」去了。\n\n\n\n  而周澤則是拿起了手機，他想了想，覺得還是得報個警，不是以對方殺自己（徐樂）的事兒來報警，而是舉報對方涉嫌盜竊。\n\n\n\n  反正讓警察去查唄，如果對方真的有案底或者曾做過其他壞事兒被警方抓住了，也是他活該。\n\n\n\n  自己占據了人家的身體，總得替這個倒霉鬼做點什麼。\n\n\n\n  雖然，在對方良好認錯態度還給自己醫藥費的前提下，自己依舊實名舉報，確實挺缺德有點生兒子沒*****兒的意思。\n\n\n\n  只是，當周澤剛剛撥通了110，那邊接線台的聲音剛傳來時， \n\n\n\n  店門口，\n\n\n\n  那個傢伙忽然又去而復返。\n\n\n\n  「還有件事兒…………」對方剛走進來，就看見拿著手機的周澤，他愣了一下，直接伸手指著周澤，「你他娘的還是要報警對不對！」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「把手機給我看一下，給我！」\n\n\n\n  周澤只能繼續搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「你說話不算數，王八蛋，老子弄死你！我看你這次死不死！」\n\n\n\n  男子瞬間進入了激動亢奮的狀態，他的精神應該有一點點的問題，可能是長期處於賭徒生活節奏和社會脫鉤的關係吧，他往往容易因為某件事的刺激而進入極端。\n\n\n\n  對方撲了過來，周澤放下手機，身體開始後退。\n\n\n\n  他前世是個醫生，不是拳手也沒練過功夫，這一世的身子也有些孱弱，論起面對面地打架，還真有些慌亂。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  男子將周澤撞擊後壓在了牆壁上，同時他的雙手開始死死地掐住周澤的脖頸。\n\n\n\n  「我讓你報警，我讓你報警，我讓你說話不算話，好，我就讓你死，讓你真的死，這次我要掐死你後再給你放血，我看你還死不死！」\n\n\n\n  男子咬牙切齒地吼道。 \n\n\n\n  可憐的書店行情，下午時分，別提顧客了，甚至門口連行人都沒幾個。\n\n\n\n  脖子那邊幾乎麻木了，也已經無法呼吸了，周澤在盡力地去掙扎，在掙扎的過程中，周澤的雙手指甲忽然變黑變長拉起來。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，周澤雙手抱住了對方的後背。\n\n\n\n  「嘶………………」\n\n\n\n  男子忽然打了一個哆嗦，冒起了白眼，直接放開了周澤的脖子，整個人倒退了幾步後撞倒了幾個書架，而後轟然倒地。\n\n\n\n  周澤得以脫困，伸手揉了揉自己的脖子，他之前其實並沒有太驚慌，畢竟，自己的指甲可是連地獄裡的惡鬼都能傷到，對付一個普通人，應該問題不大吧？\n\n\n\n  但這個指甲具體是什麼緣由有什麼用處，周澤還沒完全清楚，只知道應該是自己車禍前救治的老者「傳染」給自己的，\n\n\n\n  還真是，\n\n\n\n  得了灰指甲，一個傳染倆。\n\n\n\n  走上前，蹲了下來，周澤伸手在男子臉上拍了拍，還好，沒死，還有氣，周澤搖搖頭，拿起手機，重新報警。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  派出所做完了筆錄，警察同志讓周澤在小廳那邊等著，因為周澤舉報的事情有些邪性，說人家上門打算搶劫自己但結果被打暈的居然是「兇手」，而現在這位兇手還在醫院裡，得等他醒來才能做進一步地確定。 \n\n\n\n  不過，警察同志至少沒給周澤上手銬。\n\n\n\n  周澤旁邊蹲著一個中年男子，男子的左手被鎖在暖氣片上。\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，你牛叉啊，那貨是要搶你錢結果被你放倒了？」臉上有些邋遢的中年男子一邊說著一邊搓了搓自己滿是泥垢的長劉海，「真有我年輕時的那種范兒，對這種不開眼的毛賊，就得往死里揍！」\n\n\n\n  「喂，你給我老實點兒。」一名年輕的警察走過來呵斥道，「你這是入冬來第幾次偷電瓶車了？\n\n\n\n  我說啊，快過年了，你就不能安生點？或者找個工作正兒八經地賺點錢給家裡寄點？多大的人了都。」\n\n\n\n  「打工是不可能打工的，這輩子都不可能打工的，做生意又不會做，就是偷電瓶車電瓶才能維持的了生活這樣子，進看守所感覺就像回家一樣。\n\n\n\n  裡面個個都是人才，說話又好聽，我超喜歡裡面的！」\n\n\n\n  「哼。」年輕警察不想再搭理這貨了，直接轉身離開。\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，我剛那番感言咋樣？」油膩中年男對周澤拋了一個媚眼。\n\n\n\n  「挺有意思的。」周澤笑了笑。\n\n\n\n  「切格瓦拉是我的偶像，切格瓦拉，你知道是誰麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「我跟你說啊，這日子就得…………」油膩中年男愣了一下，目光看向了門口那邊，道：「額滴個龜龜，好漂亮啊，這是警察麼？」 \n\n\n\n  周澤側過頭看過去，在門口那邊有一個上身著藍色羽絨服下身穿長筒皮靴的女人和另外一名女警察一起向這邊走來。\n\n\n\n  「應該是警察吧。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  女人很漂亮，身材精緻，皮膚白皙，最重要的，還是她身上的那種氣質，最為加分。\n\n\n\n  「但沒穿警服啊。」油膩男子反駁道。\n\n\n\n  「可能是便衣吧。」周澤猜測道。\n\n\n\n  「你說得對，美女警花，嘖嘖，看來以後我還得多多進來了。」油膩中年男砸吧砸吧了嘴，意猶未盡的樣子，「要是能娶了她，折壽十年我都願意。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，壽元陽壽這種東西，他不敢再亂開玩笑了。\n\n\n\n  「你不同意？」油膩男見周澤搖頭，急道：「你這叫有眼無珠啊，這種女人，折壽十年換一個，絕對不虧的…………」\n\n\n\n  這時候，那名女警察和那位長靴女人一起走到了周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「徐樂，你妻子來領你走了，那邊調查清楚了，你沒事了。」女警察指了指周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「…………」油膩中年男。",

    "content": "Officer, could you please tell me what my wife's name is?\n\nThis thought just flashed through his mind, and Zhou Ze wasn't foolish enough to ask aloud, but he truly didn't know his \"wife's\" real name. In this era, very few people used their real names for QQ or WeChat IDs.\n\nThe greasy man, however, cast a resentful glance at Zhou Ze: \"Brother, you're not being fair. We agreed to be each other's broken-winged angels, remember?\"\n\nZhou Ze also returned a helpless glance: \"I'm just as surprised as you are.\"\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, \"My dumplings are delicious.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nHis \"wife\" said coldly, then turned and walked out.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow.\n\nShe drove a Cayenne and got into the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the door and sat in the passenger seat.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nit was a bit awkward.\n\nIf the unlucky guy Xu Le's marital and family life had been more normal, he wouldn't be feeling this awkward right now. He could have come up with excuses to explain his wife's concern, like feeling dizzy and forgetting some things;\n\nbut this woman clearly had the demeanor of an ice queen, seeming to ignore him completely. Even bringing him out of the police station felt like a routine task.\n\nMy dog ran away and was found by the security guard,\n\nI'm going to bring it back.\n\nIt felt like that.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was quite young, probably around the same age as himself (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car drove onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence resumed.\n\nThe woman felt her husband was too quiet today, but she had no intention of probing the reason.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She put it on speakerphone, and a voice came from the car's audio system:\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's just been a school bus collision on Qingnian Middle Road. Some injured individuals are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you to come back immediately.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled.\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor.\n\nAnd,\n\nhis wife's surname was \"Lin.\"\n\n\"I know, I'll be right back,\" the woman said, hung up the phone, exited the elevated highway ahead, and made a sharp right turn at the intersection, heading towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back. Instead, she drove straight into the parking lot of Chongchuan District People's Hospital.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze was worried she might ask him to get out and take a taxi home. He thought about having to shamelessly ask:\n\n\"Wife, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\nHe felt so foolish.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and took the elevator. Zhou Ze also got into the elevator with her. The woman went into the women's locker room, and Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench in the hallway.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims was brought in. One person was severely injured, and five children also sustained serious injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and busily attend to the injured,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench and stare blankly.\n\nIt felt a bit like a mother taking her son to work, with the son watching by the side while the mother worked.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe hospital's characteristic smell of disinfectant and the stuffiness of the central air conditioning felt nostalgic, a familiar sensation.\n\nThe emergency room was just ahead. The severely injured and critically ill patient seemed to be a young girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus that had been involved in the accident. Seeing the children crying out in pain on the operating tables was indeed heart-wrenching.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Normally, at this time, he would have already changed clothes and joined the rescue efforts. He was the most famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, but now, he could only be a spectator.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable, but he had to endure it. Moreover, this People's Hospital was considered the best hospital in Tongcheng openly, and the number and quality of doctors were unquestionable. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. Their injuries were relatively minor, only requiring wound treatment or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were stationed at the entrance of this floor. Some parents who had been notified had arrived, and they were very agitated. However, allowing parents in at this time might disrupt the rescue efforts, so they had to be stopped for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the window at the far end of the corridor, raised the window frame, and took out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, so it was convenient at this moment.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital,\" a clear childlike voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nJust as he bit the cigarette tip, he turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, pouting and looking at him indignantly.\n\nAhem,\n\nThis was rather awkward.\n\nZhou Ze had to put the cigarette away. Regardless, being lectured by a little girl about public etiquette felt a bit embarrassing.\n\n\"Little friend, aren't you cold dressed like this?\" Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a slight baby fat on her face, and big eyes. She was very cute, like a larger version of a Barbie doll.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" the little girl shook her head. \"Uncle, don't smoke in the hospital anymore.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded seriously.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine. The other children are injured, and they are in a lot of pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways and looked at the children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying, not necessarily from unbearable pain, but because one child cried and the others followed suit.\n\nThe nurses were treating the wounds while also trying to pacify the children.\n\nThe parents, temporarily stopped by the traffic police outside, were making noise and yelling outside.\n\nIn short,\n\nthis floor felt chaotic.\n\n\"Then you're really lucky,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nThe little girl didn't have a single scar on her body.\n\n\"Mm-hmm, I was sitting in the last row, so I'm fine,\" the little girl nodded, then voluntarily ran over to comfort her classmates, looking here and there, and encouraging and comforting them.\n\nA sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and instinctively took out his cigarette again, but then put it back.\n\nAs he walked back to the bench to sit down, three nurses and two doctors came out of the emergency room.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor. The female doctor was his wife.\n\n\"It's okay, we did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to pat Zhou Ze's wife's shoulder to comfort her.\n\nAs her husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nbut he didn't feel offended by this scene...\n\nThe treacherous Xu Le had left him with such a complicated mess: being a live-in son-in-law, and having a very short-tempered sister-in-law and equally ill-tempered father-in-law and mother-in-law.\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would have an affair, divorce him, and leave him in peace.\n\nAnyone who had just been resurrected and entered a new body wouldn't want to bother with the complexities of modern urban life as a live-in son-in-law, right?\n\nHowever, what surprised Zhou Ze was that his wife directly blocked the doctor's casual hand and pointed at him, saying:\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\nThere was no warmth or affection in her voice. It was simple, blunt, like saying: \"This is the husky we keep at home.\"\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir,\" the male doctor said, looking a bit awkward. After all, flirting with someone's wife in front of them always made one feel a bit unsure.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and greeted him. It seemed his wife was quite virtuous... but he couldn't bring himself to be happy. It wasn't about cuckoldry;\n\nit was simply that life would be so much better if it were simpler.\n\n\"I'll go check on the others. All the other children have been treated, and they should be fine. You should go home with your husband and get some rest early,\" the male doctor said and then walked away.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves and threw them on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and she was biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a bad mood, which meant the severely injured child had not been saved.\n\nShe looked so \"pitiable.\"\n\nZhou Ze began to understand Xu Le a little. This live-in son-in-law at least earned more than his peers. His father-in-law's family was better off, which was a prerequisite. And then there was this Dr. Lin, who was indeed very beautiful.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience a lot more in the future. Just seek peace of mind,\"\n\nZhou Ze said comfortingly from the side, being the more experienced one. His psychological resilience was naturally much stronger than his \"wife's.\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe woman replied with those two words. If Zhou Ze, as a senior, had said this, it would have been genuine advice;\n\nbut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le, and speaking like this in his image was purely a case of the pot calling the kettle black.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze shrugged and inwardly scorned Xu Le again. Look how timid you are, your wife dares to tell you to shut up in public.\n\nDr. Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up: \"I'm going to change, and then we'll go home.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt this moment, two nurses drew back the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at it. He had seen many deceased people. In his years of practicing medicine, he had saved many lives, but he had also seen many patients die helplessly before his eyes.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, this is your husband, right?\" a young nurse asked playfully. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but unlike the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses, Dr. Lin's husband had never appeared at the hospital.\n\nYou can't blame them for making jokes when facing death. It's like asking someone who goes to Tibet once and posts on WeChat saying their soul has been purified, is moved, and is devout, to stay there for ten years; they wouldn't be able to handle it. It's unrealistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin nodded. At this moment, her emotions had also calmed down a bit.\n\n\"Then you two should go back quickly. Perhaps there are some activities waiting for you when you get back, right?\n\nLet me tell you, our Dr. Lin really likes children. Hurry up and go home...\"\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\n\"...\" The little nurse.\n\nZhou Ze saw the hem of the lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind went blank, and he suddenly realized that the little girl he had just seen, who was completely unharmed,\n\nshe wasn't human!",
