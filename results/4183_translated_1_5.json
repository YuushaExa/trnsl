    "content": "Zhou Ze splashed some water on his face and slowly raised his head, looking at his reflection in the mirror. He appeared a bit haggard. As an emergency room doctor, this haggardness seemed like a standard feature.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. They seem to have fallen from upstairs, possibly a suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called from the doorway of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, coming right out,\" Zhou Ze replied, then grabbed some paper towels to dry off the water and walked out.\n\nThe ambulance soon pulled into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an elderly man in a grey Tang suit. He was coughing incessantly, expelling bloody phlegm and fragments of his spleen, his entire body covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze rushed over, pushing the stretcher while assessing the patient's condition. He yelled ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very poor.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, looking at Zhou Ze, the closest person to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be alright. We'll help you. You won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients would say such things at this point; truly calm individuals facing death were a rarity. As a doctor, this was not the time to analyze the patient's prognosis and state their chances of survival. What the patient needed at this moment was psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly gripped Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Calm yourself, relax. Your life is not in danger.\" Although his wrist felt a bit sore, Zhou Ze did not try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down anymore... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" the young nurse beside him exclaimed.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were long and, for some reason, black. They were a transparent black, like amber, not appearing to be darkened by dirt. At this moment, the old man's nails had dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat up, coughing violently. Then, his body trembled, the hand that was gripping Zhou Ze's wrist fell away, and he became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitation measures, and the defibrillator was readied.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, I'll help you with your wound,\" Wang Ya said, walking over.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't particularly worried about this minor flesh wound. Their primary concern was the possibility that the old man might have other illnesses that could put them at risk of occupational exposure. After all, there had been a lot of blood on his hands, and no one knew if he had any contagious diseases. Some illnesses, once contracted, could ruin a person's life.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor emerged from the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze. This meant the patient had not been saved. Everyone felt a bit dejected, but for them, this was a common occurrence, and they would quickly adjust.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, you should get a check-up,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have some things to attend to tonight,\" Zhou Ze replied, shaking his head. He went straight to the locker room to change his clothes, then drove his car from the hospital parking lot.\n\nAs his car passed under the Jianghai Avenue overpass, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu. A patient caused a delay. I'll be there immediately. Please ask the children to wait a little longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The call ended quickly.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at his watch; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator.\n\n\"HONNNNNNNNNNNNNK!!!!\"\n\nJust then, a heavy truck ran through the red light. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head towards the blinding high beams outside his car window.\n\nThen,\n\n\"CRASH!\"\n\nThe world spun. His small car, in front of the heavy truck, was like a fragile piece of paper, instantly flung out, tumbling several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze regained consciousness.\n\nHe found he couldn't move his body at all, as if he were trapped. At the same time, his eyes wouldn't open. He knew he had been in a serious car accident. Out of professional habit, he wanted to check his injuries right away, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he could intermittently hear the sounds of other vehicles passing by, along with various horns. *Am I still at the accident scene? Am I still in the car?* Zhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon, the sirens of police cars could be heard, followed by the sound of fire trucks. Finally, he heard the familiar wail of an ambulance siren. Zhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature around him was slightly higher; they were probably cutting open his car to rescue him. Zhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures. *What a shame. The cake in my trunk, and the orphanage children's Children's Day party, will have to be canceled.*\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice. It should be Dr. Chen from the hospital. Zhou Ze let out a sigh of relief in his heart. At least he had saved his life. This could be considered a bolt from the blue. He could hear the voices of a few nurses nearby, but due to the noise, Zhou Ze couldn't quite make them out.\n\nHowever, what Dr. Chen said next sent Zhou Ze's heart plummeting into the abyss!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\n*No,*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*I'm not dead!!*\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his mind! He wasn't dead; he still had consciousness. He wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt the heavy compressions each time, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak. He wasn't dead. He hoped they would realize he wasn't dead soon!\n\nBut after a period of frantic activity, Zhou Ze heard the crying of a few nurses he recognized. Dr. Chen punched a nearby car door, appearing grief-stricken. *Hey! Don't give up! Please don't give up! I'm not dead! I must be in a state of suspended animation. Excessive blood loss? Serious injuries? But I'm truly not dead! I should still be breathing; I should still have a heartbeat!* Zhou Ze roared inwardly.\n\nBut then, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher, presumably being put into an ambulance. Following that was the sound of the ambulance driving away. The nurses in the carriage were still crying. But these cries were particularly jarring to Zhou Ze's ears. He wasn't dead. Why were they crying! Why were they crying! Look at me again, check again, I'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped. Immediately, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leadership speaking.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone just like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very severe. Dr. Zhou suffered excessive injuries and blood loss. He has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's gone just like that?\" another vice president disbelieved.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone,\" came the voice of a department director. \"I just checked him again.\"\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You quacks!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bastards!*\n\n*Bastards!*\n\nZhou Ze cursed inwardly. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, friends, leaders, or elders. They actually believed he was dead. But could dead people hear and perceive? *I'm not dead! You bastards, you beasts, I'm not dead! Save me! Save me!*\n\nThe stretcher began to be pushed along. The surroundings were quiet, and the temperature was gradually decreasing.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The hospital director said there will be a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it. A person is just gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person. How could he be gone like this?\"\n\n\"The weather is unpredictable, and fortunes change. Just try to accept it.\"\n\nAfter the two nurses finished speaking, they left. The surroundings were empty. That chilling coldness was so clear. Zhou Ze struggled and struggled, wanting to resist, wanting to wake up, desperately wanting to make a sound. But his current feeling was like being sleep-paralyzed; no matter how hard he tried, his body wouldn't obey him. Finally, he gave up in despair. He was tired, exhausted. He knew where he was: in the hospital's morgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he sensed a faint coolness on his face, and a stinging sensation was also clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup ready?\" someone asked from nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush. He's been smashed to pieces like that; makeup isn't that quick.\"\n\n\"The hospital is urging us to send him to the memorial service.\"\n\n\"Why don't you come and do it?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed annoyed and applied more pressure while doing the makeup. Of course, their clients were dead, and the dead wouldn't feel pain or complain, so they only needed to show results to the living. Zhou Ze had no strength left to struggle. He lay there quietly, enduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brushes pressing down on his face. Finally, the makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, call them in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt his clothes being changed. Then, he was pushed out. The hospital attendant placed him into a soft, cramped space. This, he figured, must be a refrigerated coffin. Then, all the noise around him was instantly isolated. The lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking, swaying, jolting...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the refrigerated coffin must have been opened. What met his ears was funeral music. The hospital director was speaking into a microphone, praising him, lamenting him. Then came the vice president and other directors. Around him, he heard footsteps passing by. Some people walked past quietly, taking one last look at him. Some even tried to call out to him, their voices choked with tears. This was viewing the body. Viewing *my* body! *I'm not dead, I'm really not dead, I'm not dead yet! I'm not dead!* Zhou Ze cried out in his heart. He started trying again, but he still couldn't. He could only hear and feel, but he couldn't speak or open his eyes. Everyone believed he was dead, but he knew for himself that he wasn't dead yet! The children from the orphanage had also arrived and were crying beside him. They cried sincerely because Zhou Ze himself was a child from an orphanage. Consequently, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. He had been in a car accident because he was rushing back to the orphanage to spend Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. You died in the line of duty this time. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation to the orphanage. Don't worry.\" The vice president stood beside Zhou Ze and said this.\n\nSubsequently, Zhou Ze felt himself being isolated again. The lid of the refrigerated coffin must have been closed once more. Then came another series of jolts, and finally, it stopped. The lid of the refrigerated coffin was opened again. The surroundings were quiet, with occasional human voices, but not noisy. Two people, one holding his shoulders and the other holding his legs, lifted him up and placed him onto another cold shelf, which seemed to be made of steel plate. These two people were very skilled, extremely skilled. Faint cries could be heard around him. At first, Zhou Ze couldn't figure out where he had arrived, but at this moment, he suddenly understood. *Bastards! They've sent me to the crematorium! They're going to burn me! I'm not dead, you bastards! Damn your ancestors! I'm not dead! I'm not dead yet! Don't cremate me, don't cremate me! I'm truly not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!! You beasts, you mongrels! You sons of bitches!!!!!* This was Zhou Ze's most furious and most frenzied moment. He knew that once he was cremated, there would be no turning back! He would directly face death! Complete annihilation! He was unwilling, truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty years old, not yet married, had no children, still had his life, and still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice sounded from nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired because no matter how much he struggled, no matter how much he roared in his mind, the people outside could not perceive it. He was placed on a conveyor belt. The machine started, and he was being pushed forward. He knew what he was about to face, and because of that, he was terrified!\n\nNo, no, no! I'm not dead, I'm truly not dead! Don't burn me! Don't burn me! No one could hear his calls. They were only responsible for being sad, for being sorrowful, for completing this process, and then going home for dinner and continuing their lives tomorrow. Finally, Zhou Ze sensed that he had been pushed into a narrow space with a smell of burnt oil. Immediately, a sticky liquid was sprayed on him. He knew what it was: gasoline. Then, \"Ssss...\" Hot! Very hot! Pain, intense burning pain! Fire, fire, a conflagration, fire everywhere...",

    "content": "On the midnight streets,\n\nThe streetlights were a dim yellow,\n\nThe people were anxious,\n\nThe sky was cold, and a wind that cut like a knife blew.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\n\nHe didn't know where he was this time,\n\nBut he knew one thing,\n\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe was already dead, but he had come back.\n\nHe didn't know what to do,\n\nHe could only mechanically and numbly keep walking forward.\n\nHe didn't have the time to think about many other things,\n\nLike where he had just been,\n\nLike the old man he had treated before his car accident,\n\nLike the faceless woman in the red dress in the pond,\n\nLike... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyous occasion, but even when people occasionally walked past him, no matter how hard he tried to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe was being rejected by this world, isolated.\n\nThose who haven't experienced being put in \"solitary confinement\" won't understand the pain of complete isolation, and for Zhou Ze, the entire world was his cage, with a black cloth thrown over it.\n\nNo one could see him,\n\nAnd no one could communicate with him.\n\nHe couldn't pick up anything substantial,\n\nEven,\n\nThe wind could easily blow through him.\n\nHe was so weak,\n\nThe phrase \"weak as a reed\" was truly not an exaggeration for him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was,\n\nHe could see faint light spots continuously dissipating from his body,\n\nIn other words,\n\nHis body was slowly fading away.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would completely disappear, with the last trace of him wiped away.\n\nHe didn't know how all this was happening, but he knew that his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Tieguai Li entered the body of a starving person to become the figure passed down through generations.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories of ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return to life,\" and he also wanted to borrow a corpse to return to life. He was very cold and panicked, and he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nHe didn't even care who the person was.\n\nPeople are always selfish at times like these, and Zhou Ze was no exception, and he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, every time he prepared to approach someone, light and fire would appear at the person's head and shoulders, preventing him from getting close, and he was even harmed, accelerating his \"evaporation.\"\n\nHe was tired, and somewhat numb,\n\nHe was waiting for his end,\n\nWaiting for his conclusion.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him a bit more composed.\n\nMoreover, in Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he stayed here, the longer he would endure the torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a shop still lit up; it looked like a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\n\nSomeone opened the door and came out. It was a man in a hoodie, wearing a cap, so his face couldn't be seen clearly. He looked around a bit and then left in a hurry.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze, who was standing less than five meters away.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\n\nYes,\n\nA warm aura.\n\nThis warmth was inexplicable to Zhou Ze, but he was like a freezing person who suddenly found a box of matches; even if he knew the matches wouldn't save his life, he would still strike one to feel the last warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it. His body directly passed through the bookstore's glass door and continued inside, arriving behind the bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\n\nLay a person,\n\nA handsome young man, perhaps around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the store had air conditioning, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\n\nHe was lying on the floor, but Zhou Ze sensed a warmth from him, like a poor man finding a bag of gold coins while walking on the road at night.\n\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, in his current state, was not qualified to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and squatted in front of the young man.\n\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to find the warmth he needed.\n\nHe reached out a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\n\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embed themselves into the other person's flesh.\n\nIt was a strange feeling, different from the \"gentle breeze\" that had blown through him on the street. This was a fusion, a merging through his fingernails as a medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze began to enter the other person's body, and the two began to overlap.\n\n...\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was woken by a shove, or rather, \"disturbed.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his hands previously resting on it.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, with an air of command.\n\nLooking up, Zhou Ze saw the woman in front of him; no, she should be called a girl, about high school age. Although a young lady, she still had a bit of childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what do you mean? You've gotten bold, haven't you? You want to give my parents and sister a hard time, right? How dare you not come home all night yesterday!\n\nWho gave you the guts!\"\n\nXu Le?\n\nWho is that?\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion, finding them smooth. His own hands had calluses from practicing with surgical instruments for a long time, but these hands did not.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slapped the counter, looking furious.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the store entrance. He saw his reflection: an unfamiliar face. No, he had seen this face before; it was the face he had seen last night.\n\nThis body,\n\nIs it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are angry, and my mom is throwing a tantrum at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now is from my family. What right do you have, as a live-in son-in-law, to put on airs in my house?\n\nWho are you trying to impress!\n\nIf you dare not come home again tonight, believe me, I'll come over and slap you!\"\n\nThe girl raised her hand as if to strike, but she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" wasn't dodging and begging as usual. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\n\nAt this moment, she checked the time and found it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school first. I'll settle with you tonight!\"\n\nThe girl huffed and left angrily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop there, and a mobile phone next to it.\n\nEven now, he still hadn't adapted to the process of his identity change.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\n\nAs a result,\n\nHe had now become this person.\n\nWhat did that girl just say?\n\nI am... a live-in son-in-law?\n\nHave a wife?\n\nAnd in-laws?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" speaking to his \"brother-in-law\" just now, his \"live-in son-in-law\" status really fit the good old traditions of ancient times.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-in-law,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times; his status was almost the same as that of a criminal. During the Han and Tang dynasties, those forcibly sent to the border often included such sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up the phone. It didn't have a password. Perhaps the guy was lazy or didn't dare to set one, but at least it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThere were very few people in his QQ list: some junior high, high school, and university classmates. Then there was a \"Family\" list, with only one person, noted as \"Wife.\"\n\nHe opened the chat history with her; it was empty.\n\nFine,\n\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to search. He found a woman noted as \"Wife.\" There were replies here, mostly Xu Le asking about things, like what to eat tonight, what to prepare for tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how was your health, and a whole lot more.\n\nAnd her replies were often perfunctory and cold,\n\nUsing:\n\n\"Oh\"\n\n\"Mhm\"\n\n\"Okay\"\n\nto substitute.\n\nZhou Ze threw the phone aside. This social relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails looked no different from those of ordinary people.\n\nBut the old man he had treated before the car accident, the escape from the faceless woman, and entering this guy's body – his fingernails had played a crucial role in all these events.\n\nWith a thought,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze noticed his fingernails slowly growing longer, and also becoming dark and translucent. There was even a faint black mist swirling around his fingernails.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nHe let out a long sigh,\n\nClosed his eyes,\n\nAnd when he opened them again,\n\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort caused by the identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, not sure if he forgot or simply didn't feel hungry.\n\nThis place was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's former home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\n\nBy the afternoon, Zhou Ze sighed and slowly stood up. He would make the best of it.\n\nHe started trying to clean the bookshelves, at least to find something to do.\n\nThe old man who had choked him before his death had said, \"He's been discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said, \"You'll be caught sooner or later,\" which made Zhou Ze feel a sense of crisis.\n\nHis current state was one of \"barely surviving.\" Coming back from the dead was a stroke of luck, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to fit into this identity, preferably without causing too much anomaly and attracting the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this store was really bad. The decline of the traditional book market was not a new thing, and this place was not on the golden street right at the school gate.\n\nIt could only be said that \"Xu Le's\" choice to open a bookstore here was questionable, even for breaking even.\n\nIt wasn't until three in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\n\nThe customer was browsing the children's books section and had been there for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while and then walked over to ask, \"What subject are you choosing?\"\n\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't understand either.\n\n\"Just looking around,\" the other person replied.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze said nothing more. He hadn't yet integrated into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nThe person suddenly walked behind him and spoke in a low voice:\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and robbed you.\n\nAnd I even specifically tested it,\n\nYou clearly had no breath then.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze blinked, so the reason he was able to possess Xu Le's body last night was because Xu Le had just been killed?\n\nBecause the body was still warm, he could enter it?\n\nLooking at it this way, he seemed to be quite lucky.\n\nWithout any aversion, anger, or panic about his identity being exposed, Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the man behind him, who was about his age.\n\nThe man blinked.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy,\n\nIt was relief,\n\nAnd even,\n\nA hint of admiration.\n\nAs a host, Zhou Ze knew what a difficult situation he was facing last night. If this guy hadn't happened to commit murder at that time, he might have been completely annihilated and would never see the sun today.\n\n\"Sorry, I fainted last night and felt very uncomfortable in my head this morning, like I was drunk. I forgot what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the other party would guess that he was a ghost possessing a body, unless the other party had water in their brain.\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The other party pointed to his nose, asking somewhat absurdly, \"Even though I already told you that I hit you hard yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's okay, I actually thank you for not taking my phone and computer from the table.\"\n\n\"That... I forgot.\" The man scratched his head. \"I'm glad you're okay. This is the money I stole from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out 300 yuan from his pocket, then fumbled for more and took out another 800 yuan.\n\n\"800 yuan is for your medical expenses, and 300 yuan is what I stole yesterday,\" the man pursed his lips. \"Yesterday, I lost my entire salary to the bookie gambling online. When I passed by your bookstore, I suddenly wanted some money, and after I knocked you down, I found you had no breath, and I was scared to death.\n\nAfter running home, I couldn't sleep all night, thinking if the police would suddenly break in and arrest me for robbery and murder. I only took 300 yuan, and I felt so stupid, so worthless.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\n\"Bro, I'm so glad you're not dead, really. I've been hanging around outside since this morning. I was waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for the police to come, and then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\nYou know, at that time, I was almost kneeling on the ground to kowtow to you. Thank you, you're tough and didn't die, otherwise I'd be finished. With so many cameras here, if you had died, I definitely wouldn't have escaped.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the 1,100 yuan in his hand and then at the \"murderer\" in front of him who was shedding tears and repenting. He felt that the scene was very strange.\n\nTo be honest, \"Xu Le\" was dead. Because he died, Zhou Ze could take over his body. And because Zhou Ze took over his body, the guy in front of him was spared from murder charges.\n\nBoth he and the guy in front of him benefited, only that poor Xu Le was unlucky.\n\n\"Okay, it's fine. Maybe I just had a bad breath last night,\" Zhou Ze moved the other person's hand away from his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor and had seen all sorts of filth. But in that extreme environment, he had developed some潔癖 (jié pí - obsessive-compulsive disorder regarding cleanliness). In fact, most emergency doctors have some degree of洁癖.\n\nPrecisely because he had seen too much dirt and filth, he cherished \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" The man asked with some joy.\n\n\"Yeah, I don't blame you,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"You should go back to work and live your life. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, bro. You're a decent guy.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily and left the bookstore to welcome his \"new life.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he should still call the police, not to report that the man had killed him (Xu Le), but to report the man for suspected theft.\n\nLet the police investigate. If the man really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and was caught by the police, then it would be his own fault.\n\nSince he had taken over someone else's body, he had to do something for that unfortunate guy.\n\nAlthough it was quite heartless and resembled the saying \"having sons without a dick\"¹ to report him by his real name, even after the other party sincerely apologized and returned his medical expenses, he still felt it was the right thing to do.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the voice from the other end just came through,\n\nAt the entrance of the shop,\n\nThe guy suddenly came back.\n\n\"One more thing...\" As the other person walked in, he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He blinked and directly pointed at Zhou Ze, \"You're still going to call the police, aren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone, give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only shake his head again.\n\n\"You broke your promise, you son of a bitch, I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly entered an excited and agitated state. He should have some mental issues, possibly due to his lifestyle as a gambler and his detachment from society. He often fell into extremes due to certain stimuli.\n\nThe other party lunged over, Zhou Ze put down his phone and started to retreat.\n\nHe was a doctor in his previous life, not a boxer, nor had he practiced martial arts. His body in this life was also a bit weak. When it came to fighting head-on, he was indeed a little flustered.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man slammed Zhou Ze against the wall and then began to tightly grip Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I'll let you call the police, I'll let you call the police, I'll let you break your promise, fine, I'll let you die, really die. This time, I'll choke you to death and then bleed you, let's see if you die!\"\n\nThe man roared through gritted teeth.\n\nPoor bookstore, in the afternoon, there were no customers, and not even many pedestrians at the entrance.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. During the struggle, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and grew longer.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his arms around the man's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, rolled his eyes, and immediately let go of Zhou Ze's neck. He stumbled back a few steps, knocked over a few bookshelves, and then collapsed to the ground with a thud.\n\nZhou Ze managed to escape and reached out to rub his neck. He wasn't too panicked before, after all, his fingernails could even harm ghosts in hell. Dealing with an ordinary person should be no problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze hadn't fully understood the reason and use of these fingernails. He only knew that they were \"infectious\" from the old man he had saved before his car accident.\n\nIndeed,\n\nHaving nail fungus, one infects two.\n\nWalking forward, Zhou Ze squatted down and reached out to pat the man's face. Fortunately, he wasn't dead, he was still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n...\n\nAfter finishing his statement at the police station, the police officer asked Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall because the matter Zhou Ze reported was a bit bizarre. He reported that the robber who had attacked him but was knocked out by him was actually the \"murderer.\" And now this murderer was in the hospital, so they had to wait for him to wake up for further confirmation.\n\nHowever, the police officer at least didn't handcuff Zhou Ze.\n\nA middle-aged man was squatting next to Zhou Ze, his left hand handcuffed to the radiator.\n\n\"Bro, you're awesome. That guy was trying to rob you and you knocked him down?\" The middle-aged man with a somewhat disheveled face rubbed his muddy bangs. \"You've got that vibe from my youth. You have to beat these blind troublemakers to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you behave yourself,\" a young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. \"This is your how many times stealing electric bikes since winter?\n\nI say, it's almost the New Year, can't you be a little more settled? Or find a job and earn some money properly to send home? How old are you?\"\n\n\"Working is impossible, never working in this life. I don't know how to do business, so stealing electric bike batteries is the only way to sustain my life. Going to the detention center feels like going home.\n\nEveryone inside is talented, and they speak so nicely, I love it inside!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to deal with this guy anymore and turned away.\n\n\"Bro, how was my speech just now?\" The greasy middle-aged man gave Zhou Ze a flirtatious glance.\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol, Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Let me tell you, this life has to be...\" The greasy middle-aged man blinked and looked towards the entrance, saying, \"Oh my god, so beautiful, is that a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the entrance, a woman wearing a blue down jacket and long leather boots was walking towards them with another female police officer.\n\n\"Should be a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, the aura she exuded was the most attractive.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a police uniform,\" the greasy man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe she's plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right, beautiful police flower, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in more often,\" the greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, still looking unsatisfied. \"If I could marry her, I'd be willing to lose ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He didn't dare to joke about lifespan or years of life anymore.\n\n\"You don't agree?\" The greasy man saw Zhou Ze shake his head and said anxiously, \"You're blind! A woman like this, losing ten years of life for one is definitely not a loss...\"\n\nAt this moment, the female police officer and the woman in the long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to pick you up. The investigation over there is clear, and you're okay now,\" the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" The greasy middle-aged man.\n\n---\n¹ \"有兒子沒屁眼的\" (yǒu érzi méi pìyǎn) is a very crude and offensive curse in Chinese, literally meaning \"have sons without an asshole,\" implying extreme misfortune or a lack of offspring.

    "content": "\"Officer, excuse me, what is my wife's name again?\"\n\nThis thought only crossed his mind for a moment. Zhou Ze wasn't *that* foolish, but he genuinely didn't know his \"wife's\" real name. In this era, people rarely used their real names for their QQ or WeChat IDs.\n\nThe greasy man, however, cast a mournful glance at Zhou Ze. \"Brother, you're not being honest. We agreed to be broken-winged angels for each other, remember?\"\n\nZhou Ze returned the glance with a hint of helplessness. \"I'm just as surprised.\"\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, \"My dumplings are delicious.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nHis \"wife\" said in a cool tone, then turned and walked directly towards the exit.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow.\n\nShe drove a Cayenne and got into the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nIt was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unlucky fellow Xu Le's marital and family life had been more normal, he wouldn't be in such an awkward situation now. He could have found some excuse to explain to his beautiful wife's concern, like feeling dizzy and forgetting things.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the aura of an ice queen, seeming completely uninterested in him. Even fetching him from the police station felt like a mere formality.\n\n\"My dog ran away and was found by a security guard.\n\nI'm just going to pick him up.\"\n\nThat was the feeling.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was quite young, probably around the same age as himself (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car merged onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nSilence returned.\n\nThe woman thought her husband was being unusually quiet today but had no intention of probing for the reason.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She pressed the speakerphone, and a voice came from the car's audio system:\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's just been a school bus collision on Qingnian Middle Road. Injured individuals are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you back immediately.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled.\n\nSo his wife was a doctor.\n\nAnd also,\n\nHis wife's surname was \"Lin.\"\n\n\"I know, I'll be right back.\" The woman hung up, exited the elevated highway, and made a sharp turn at the traffic light, heading towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back. Instead, she drove all the way into the Chongchuan District People's Hospital parking lot.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze was genuinely worried she might ask him to get out and take a taxi home. He thought he'd have to shamelessly ask:\n\n\"Wife, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\nHe felt ridiculous just thinking about it.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman went into the hospital building and got into the elevator, and Zhou Ze followed into the elevator. The woman went into the women's locker room, and Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench in the hallway.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived. One person was severely injured, and five children also sustained non-minor injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and busily start treating patients,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench and stare blankly.\n\nIt felt a bit like a mother bringing her son to work, with the son just watching from the side, playing with himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe hospital's characteristic smell of disinfectant and the stuffiness of the central air conditioning were somewhat nostalgic, a familiar feeling.\n\nAhead was the emergency room. The severely injured and critically ill patient appeared to be a girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus that had been involved in the accident. Seeing the children crying in pain on the operating table was indeed quite heart-wrenching.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Normally, at this time, he would have already changed and joined the treatment. He was the most famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, but now, he could only be an observer.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable, but he had to endure it. Besides, this People's Hospital was considered the best hospital in Tongcheng, and the number and quality of doctors were beyond question. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. They had less severe injuries and only needed wound treatment or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were stationed at the entrance of this floor. Parents who had been notified had already arrived and were very agitated. However, allowing parents in at this moment might disrupt the treatment process, so they could only be stopped for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, and walked to the window at the far end of the corridor. He raised the window frame and took out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, so it was convenient at this moment.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nJust as he put the cigarette tip in his mouth, a clear girlish voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily-print dress standing behind him, pouting and looking at him indignantly.\n\nAhem,\n\nThis was a bit awkward.\n\nZhou Ze put away the cigarette. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public morality was somewhat embarrassing.\n\n\"Little friend, aren't you cold wearing so little?\" Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a slightly chubby face, and big eyes. She was very cute, like a larger version of a Barbie doll.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" the little girl shook her head. \"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital anymore.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded seriously.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine. The other children are injured, and they are in pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways and looked at the children being bandaged behind her. Most of them were crying. It wasn't entirely due to unbearable pain, but rather, when one person cried, others would follow.\n\nNurses were not only treating wounds but also trying to comfort the children.\n\nOutside, the parents, temporarily stopped by the traffic police, were arguing and cursing incessantly.\n\nIn short,\n\nThis floor gave a messy impression.\n\n\"Then you're really lucky,\" Zhou Ze exclaimed.\n\nThe little girl didn't even have a scratch on her.\n\n\"Mhm, I was sitting in the back row, so I'm fine,\" the little girl nodded, then voluntarily ran over to comfort her classmates. She looked here and there, encouraging and soothing them.\n\nA sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and subconsciously took out his cigarette again, but then put it back.\n\nAs he walked back to the bench to sit down, three nurses and two doctors came out of the emergency room.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor. The female doctor was his wife.\n\n\"It's okay, we did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to pat Zhou Ze's wife's shoulder to comfort her.\n\nAs her husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nBut he didn't dislike this scene...\n\nThe infuriating Xu Le had left him such a complicated mess: a live-in son-in-law, a very ill-tempered sister-in-law, and equally ill-tempered mother-in-law and father-in-law.\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would just cheat on him, divorce him, and leave him in peace.\n\nAnyone who had just been resurrected into a new body wouldn't want to bother with the myriad flavors of a modern urban gigolo life, would they?\n\nHowever, what surprised Zhou Ze was that his wife actually reached out and blocked the doctor's outstretched hand, pointing at him directly and saying:\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\nThere was no tenderness or affection in her words. It was simple, blunt, like saying: \"This is the husky we keep at home.\"\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir,\" the male doctor said, his expression a bit awkward. No matter what, trying to flirt with someone's wife in front of them always felt a little less confident.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and greeted him. It seemed his wife was very chaste... but he couldn't bring himself to be happy. It wasn't about jealousy of infidelity,\n\nIt was simply that life was better when it was simpler.\n\n\"I'll go check on the others. All the other children have been treated, and there shouldn't be any more issues. You two should go home and rest soon,\" the male doctor said and then walked away.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves and threw them on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, her lips bitten between her teeth. Clearly, she was in a bad mood, which meant the severely injured child hadn't been saved.\n\nShe looked very pitiable in this state.\n\nZhou Ze somewhat understood Xu Le now. This live-in son-in-law at least earned more than his peers. His in-laws' financial situation was better than his, that was a prerequisite. And then there was this Dr. Lin, who was indeed very good-looking.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience much more in the future. Just seek peace of mind,\"\n\nZhou Ze said comfortingly from the side, like a seasoned veteran. His experience far surpassed his \"wife's,\" so his psychological resilience was naturally much stronger.\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe woman replied with those two words. If Zhou Ze had said this as his former senior self, it would indeed be advice.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le, and speaking like this in his appearance was purely speaking from a position of privilege, implying \"it's easy for you to say.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze shrugged his shoulders and inwardly despised Xu Le again. Look how timid he was, his wife dared to tell him to shut up directly in front of others.\n\nDr. Lin, with reddened eyes, slowly stood up. \"I'm going to change. Let's go home.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt this moment, two nurses pulled open the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over it. He had seen many deceased people. In his years of medical practice, he had saved many, but he had also seen many patients die helplessly before his eyes.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, this is your husband, right?\" a young nurse asked playfully. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but unlike the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses, Dr. Lin's husband had never shown up at the hospital.\n\nOne couldn't blame them for making a joke even in the face of death. It was like asking someone who posted on social media about their spiritual purification after visiting Tibet once to stay there for ten years; they wouldn't be able to handle it, it wasn't realistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin nodded in response. By then, her emotions had somewhat calmed down.\n\n\"Then you two should hurry back. Maybe there's something planned when you get home, right?\n\nI'm telling you, our Dr. Lin really likes children. You two should hurry home...\"\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\n\"...\" the young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze saw the edge of a lily-print skirt peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind went \"boom,\" and he suddenly realized the uninjured little girl he had just seen...\n\nShe wasn't human!",
