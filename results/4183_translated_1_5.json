    "content": "Cupping a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head, looking at himself in the mirror, slightly worn. For an emergency room doctor, such exhaustion seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon, seems they fell from a building. Don't know if it's suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called out from the men's restroom doorway.\n\n\"Got it, be right there,\" Zhou Ze replied, then pulled out tissues to wipe the water from his face before heading out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly pulled into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an elderly man dressed in a grey Tang suit. The elder coughed incessantly, constantly spitting out bloody froth and fragments of internal organs, his entire body covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition, simultaneously shouting to the people ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very poor.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe elder opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these words at such a moment; only a minority can calmly face death. As a doctor, this was certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition or tell him his chances of survival. What the patient needed at this moment was psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is truly terrifying...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a solemn expression.\n\n\"Steady your emotions, relax. Your life is not in danger.\" Though his wrist was aching, Zhou Ze did not try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down again... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp sting in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" the young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe elder's fingernails were long, and for some unknown reason, they were black—a translucent black like amber, not appearing to have dirt accumulated within.\n\nAnd at this moment, the elder's fingernails had already dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... Haha... *cough cough cough*...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly sat up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, and the hand clutching Zhou Ze's fell away. He became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe elder was pushed into the Emergency Room, where doctors and nurses began resuscitation efforts, with the defibrillator also ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me treat your wound.\" Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't particularly worried about minor flesh wounds. Their greatest concern was the risk of occupational exposure should the elder have other diseases, especially since there was so much blood on his hands, and no one knew if he carried any infectious diseases.\n\nSome illnesses, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the Emergency Room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person hadn't been saved.\n\nEveryone's spirits were a bit low, but for them, this kind of thing was commonplace; they would soon adjust.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let's get it checked out,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something else tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got into his car, and drove away.\n\nAs soon as his car reached the Jianghai Avenue Viaduct, his phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now, please ask the children to wait for me a little longer.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright.\" The other side quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze pressed the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"BEEP!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nA heavy truck ran the red light and came speeding over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look out the window at the blinding high beam lights,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly sent flying by the heavy truck, tumbling several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze regained consciousness.\n\nHe found that his body was completely immobilized, as if stuck.\n\nAt the same time, he couldn't open his eyes. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he desperately wanted to check his injuries, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he occasionally heard other vehicles driving by, along with various horn honks.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car sounded, along with the sound of a fire truck,\n\nFinally, the familiar and comforting siren of an ambulance arrived.\n\nZhou Ze felt his body being moved; the nearby temperature was a bit high, likely due to the cutting of his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his back trunk and the Children's Day<sup>1</sup> party for the orphanage kids were all ruined.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice called out.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief inwardly. At least he had survived. This could be considered a sudden, unexpected calamity<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThere were also sounds of a few nurses nearby, but the surrounding noise was too loud for Zhou Ze to hear clearly.\n\nBut then, Doctor Chen's next sentence plunged Zhou Ze's heart to rock bottom!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression, but he couldn't open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe wished they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying of several nurses he knew,\n\nDoctor Chen punched the nearby car door, looking incredibly grief-stricken.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nPlease don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of apparent death<sup>3</sup> now,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared frantically in his mind.\n\nBut then, he felt himself being lifted onto a stretcher, presumably being taken into the ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, he heard the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded particularly grating in Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy were they crying!\n\nWhy cry!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leadership speaking:\n\n\"Little Zhou is just... gone?\"\n\n\"The accident was very serious. Doctor Zhou was severely injured, lost too much blood, and has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? Just like that?\" Another vice-dean still couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou incompetent doctors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, these people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his superiors or elders.\n\nThey actually believed he was dead,\n\nBut could a dead person still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nBrutes,\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis was Zhou Ze's most frantic, most desperate moment.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty, he hadn't started a family, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice sounded beside him.\n\n\"Whack!\" A smack on her mouth.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on a conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was incredibly terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for their sorrow,\n\nOnly responsible for their sadness,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this procedure,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing their lives tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being pushed into a narrow place filled with the smell of greasy residue,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA viscous liquid was sprayed on him,\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nExtremely hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere...\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> **Children's Day (六一儿童节, Liù Yī Értóng Jié):** A holiday celebrated annually on June 1st in China, dedicated to children.\n<sup>2</sup> **Sudden, unexpected calamity (飞来横祸, fēilái hènghuò):** An unforeseen disaster; a sudden misfortune that strikes unexpectedly, literally \"flying calamity.\"\n<sup>3</sup> **State of apparent death (假死状态, jiǎsǐ zhuàngtài):** A medical term referring to a state where vital signs are so weak they are barely detectable, resembling death, but the person is still alive.

    "content": "Midnight streets,\n\nYellow streetlights,\nPanicked people.\nThe weather was very cold, and the wind, like knives, cut at people.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\nHe didn't know where this was again,\nBut he knew one thing:\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe was already dead, but he was back again.\nHe didn't know what he should do,\nHe could only continue walking forward mechanically and numbly.\n\nHe didn't have the luxury of thinking about too many other things right now,\nSuch as the place he had just gone down to,\nSuch as the old man he had treated before the car accident,\nSuch as the faceless woman in a red dress in the pond,\nSuch as... his fingernails.\n\nHe was back, which should have been a joyful thing, but even if people occasionally walked by him, even if he tried hard to greet them, still no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe was shunned and isolated by this world.\n\nAnyone who hadn't experienced being put in \"solitary confinement\" wouldn't understand the pain of being completely isolated. For Zhou Ze, the entire world right now was his cage, and the cage was draped with a layer of black cloth.\n\nNo one could see him,\nNor could anyone communicate with him.\nHe couldn't pick up any physical object,\nAnd even,\nThe wind could easily blow right through him.\n\nHe was so frail,\nThe phrase \"too weak to stand the wind\" was truly no exaggeration when applied to him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was,\nHe could see faint light specks constantly dissipating from his body.\nIn other words,\nHis body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would completely disappear, every last insignificant trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this happened, but he knew clearly that he really didn't have much time left.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li entered the body of a person who had starved to death and collapsed, in the form of a soul, and only then became the image passed down through later generations.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return a soul.\" He too wanted to borrow a corpse to return a soul. He was very cold, and very panicked; he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nHe didn't even mind whose body it was.\n\nAt times like this, people are always selfish, and Zhou Ze was no exception. What's more, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he tried to approach someone, light and fire would appear above that person's head and on their shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even suffered harm from it, accelerating his \"evaporation\" speed.\n\nHe was a bit tired, and a bit numb.\nHe was waiting for his end,\nWaiting for his finish.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him feel a little more at ease.\n\nMoreover, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he continued to linger here, the longer he would endure torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a storefront still lit up. It seemed to be a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\n\nSomeone pushed the door open from inside and walked out. It was a man wearing a hoodie. The man wore a hat, obscuring his true face. He looked left and right for a while, then hurried away.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze, who was standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nInitially, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but soon after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\n\nYes,\nA warm aura.\n\nThis warmth baffled Zhou Ze somewhat, but at that moment, he was like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly received a box of matches; even if he knew the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body passing directly through the bookstore's glass door. He continued walking inside, arriving behind the bookstore's bookshelf.\n\nBehind the bookshelf,\nLay a person.\nIt was a handsome young man, probably twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the store had the air conditioning on, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\n\nHe lay on the ground, but on him, Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling, like a pauper walking on the road at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\n\nThis attraction was irresistible, and the current Zhou Ze had no right to refuse it!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and squatted down in front of the young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to touch the warmth he needed.\n\nHe extended a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\nZhou Ze watched as his fingernails slowly embedded into the other person's body.\nIt was a very strange feeling, different from when the \"breeze\" blew through his body earlier on the street. This was a fusion, a merging conducted with his fingernails as a medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other person's body. The two began to overlap.\n\n...............\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was woken up by a series of pushes—no, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his hands previously resting on it.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp, high-pitched, and carried a demanding tone.\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the woman in front of him—no, to be precise, she should be a girl, probably around high school age. Although she was a big girl, she still hadn't quite outgrown her childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what exactly do you mean? You think you're so capable now, huh? You want to show attitude to my parents and my sister, huh? You actually dared not come home all night last night!\nWho gave you such guts!\"\n\n\"Xu Le?\"\n\"Who is that?\"\n\nZhou Ze somewhat blankly spread out his hands, finding them very smooth. His former hands, however, had some calluses due to long-term practice with surgical instruments, but these hands did not.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slapped the counter with one palm, aggressively.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the storefront door. He saw his reflection—a strange face. No, he had seen this face before. It was the face he had seen last night.\n\nThis body,\nIs mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are all angry now, and my mom even threw a tantrum at home! I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now comes from my family! What right do you, this live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\nWho are you trying to put on a show for!\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe it or not, I'll come over and smack you directly!\"\n\nThe girl made a gesture of raising her palm, but she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg for mercy as usual. Instead, the meaning in his eyes made her feel a bit scared.\n\nAt that moment, she looked at the time and found it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school now, I'll settle accounts with you tonight!\"\n\nThe girl left, huffing.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down on the chair behind the counter. Here was an old-fashioned laptop, and next to it, a mobile phone.\n\nEven now, he still hadn't managed to adapt to the process of his identity change.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\nAs a result,\nHe was now this person.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nHe was... a live-in son-in-law?\nHe had a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" when she spoke to \"this brother-in-law\" just now, his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient traditions.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-plugger\"*, was not only despised by his wife's family but also looked down upon by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even similar to criminals; during the Han and Tang dynasties, live-in sons-in-law were often among those forced to guard the borders.\n\nHe picked up the phone. It had no password set. He didn't know if the previous owner was lazy or didn't dare set one, but at least at this moment, it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThere were few people on the QQ list, just a few middle school, high school, and college classmates. Then there was a family list with only one person, noted as \"wife.\"\n\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her—empty.\n\nAlright,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried searching. He found the woman noted as \"wife.\" Here there were replies. They were basically all Xu Le asking things, such as what to eat tonight, what to prepare tonight, how much money was needed for stocking up, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how her health was—a whole bunch.\n\nAnd the other party's replies were often perfunctory and aloof,\nUsing:\n\"Oh\"\n\"Mm\"\n\"Okay\"\nIn their place.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This interpersonal relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm. His fingernails were no different from ordinary people's.\n\nHowever, in matters like the old man he treated before the car accident, his escape from the faceless woman's grasp, and his entering this guy's body, his fingernails had played an extremely crucial role.\n\nWith a thought,\nAt that very moment,\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly lengthening, and at the same time, becoming pitch-black and translucent. There was even faint black mist lingering around them.\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nClosed his eyes,\nAnd when he opened them again,\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nAll the way from morning to noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort brought by his identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, unsure if he'd forgotten or simply didn't feel hungry.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's former home was in Chongchuan District, and he was now in Gangzha District; the distance wasn't far.\n\nBy afternoon, Zhou Ze finally sighed and silently stood up. Since he was here, he would make the best of it.**\n\nHe began to try cleaning the bookshelves. Anyway, he might as well find something to do first.\n\nThe old man who had choked him before his death had once said, \"He was discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said, \"You will be caught sooner or later,\" which made Zhou Ze feel a slight sense of crisis in his heart.\n\nHis current state could be considered \"barely surviving\"***. Dying and being reborn was a stroke of heavenly luck, so he cherished it deeply. At least, before fully understanding the situation and gathering enough clues, he had to assume this identity. It would be best not to cause too much abnormality, and not to attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThis store's business was really bad. The sluggishness of the traditional book market hadn't been a recent development, and this place wasn't on a prime commercial street right by a school's main entrance.\n\nOne could only say that \"Xu Le's\" decision to open a bookstore here made it questionable whether he could even break even.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\n\nThe customer was browsing around the elementary school reading section, and had been browsing for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What genre are you looking for?\"\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't understand it either.\n\n\"Just looking around,\" the other party replied.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze then ignored him. He hadn't yet integrated into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut at that moment,\nThe other party suddenly walked behind him and quietly said:\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night I hit your head with a baseball bat, robbed your money,\nAnd I even deliberately tried it out.\nYou clearly had no breath left then.\"\n\n---\n*A \"door-plugger\" (倒插門 / dào chā mén) is a highly derogatory term for a live-in son-in-law, implying he is just a \"plug\" or a placeholder in the wife's family, with no real status or power.\n**\"Since he was here, he would make the best of it\" (既來之則安之 / jì lái zhī zé ān zhī) is an idiom meaning to accept the situation one is in and make the most of it; to be at ease with one's circumstances.\n***\"Barely surviving\" (苟活 / gǒu huó) implies living ignobly or barely holding onto life, often suggesting a lack of dignity or purpose in one's continued existence.",

    "content": "周澤愣了一下，所以說，昨晚自己之所以能拿「徐樂」這個人的身體去借屍還魂，還是因為他剛剛被殺了？\n\n\n\n  因為身子還熱乎著，所以自己才能進去？\n\n\n\n  這樣看來，自己，好像真的有些幸運了。\n\n\n\n  沒有反感，也沒有憤怒，更沒有可能被戳破身份的驚慌，周澤轉過身，看著自己身後的這位年紀和自己差不多的男子。\n\n\n\n  男子愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  他從周澤眼裡看見了不同尋常的東西，\n\n\n\n  是歡喜，\n\n\n\n  是慶幸，\n\n\n\n  甚至，\n\n\n\n  還有一點點的欣賞。\n\n\n\n  作為一個宿主，在昨晚那個情況下，周澤清楚自己面對的是何種艱難局面，如果這個傢伙沒恰巧在那個時候殺人，自己可能已經魂飛魄散了，根本見不到今天的太陽。\n\n\n\n  「抱歉，我昨晚昏過去，早上起來腦子很不舒服，像是喝醉了酒一樣，忘記了昨天的事情。」周澤隨意地解釋道。\n\n\n\n  他不認為對方會猜出來自己是鬼魂借屍還魂，除非對方腦子進水了。\n\n\n\n  「你不怪我？」對方指了指自己的鼻子，有些荒謬道，「哪怕我已經告訴你，昨天抽了你一記悶棍？」\n\n\n\n  「沒事兒，我倒是謝謝你，沒把我桌上的手機和電腦拿走。」 \n\n\n\n  「那個……是我忘了。」男子撓了撓頭，「你沒事就好，這是我昨天搶的你的錢。」\n\n\n\n  男子主動地從口袋裡拿出了三百塊，然後又掏了掏，又取出了八百塊。\n\n\n\n  「八百塊是你的醫藥費，三百是昨天搶的。」男子抿了抿嘴唇，「昨天上網賭錢把自己的工資都輸給狗莊了，路過你這書店時忽然想弄點錢花花，把你打倒之後我發現你沒鼻息了，還嚇得要死。\n\n\n\n  跑回家後一整晚沒睡著，就想著警察會不會忽然破門進來把我抓走，入室搶劫加殺人，就拿了三百塊，感覺自己真傻，真不值。」\n\n\n\n  男子伸手在周澤的肩膀上拍了拍，\n\n\n\n  「哥們兒，你沒死真好，真的，我從早上開始就在外頭轉悠了，我在等有人報警，等警察過來，結果我看見你居然還在書店裡。\n\n\n\n  你知道麼，那時候我都快跪在地上給你磕頭了，謝謝你，你命硬，沒死，不然我就完了，這裡這麼多攝像頭，要是你死了，我肯定跑不掉。」\n\n\n\n  周澤看著自己手中的一千一百塊，再看著眼前這位噙著眼淚對自己懺悔的「殺人兇手」，總覺得，這畫風很詭異。\n\n\n\n  老實說，「徐樂」是死了，因為他死了，自己才能鵲巢鳩占，而因為自己鵲巢鳩占了，眼前的這個傢伙就免去了殺人罪。\n\n\n\n  自己和眼前的這個傢伙，都獲利了，唯有那個徐樂，倒霉鬼一個。 \n\n\n\n  「行，沒事了，可能昨晚我只是岔氣了。」周澤將對方的手從自己肩膀上挪開，他以前是一名急診醫生，什麼樣的污穢沒見過？但他卻在那種極端環境下，養成了些許潔癖，事實上，大部分急診醫生都有輕重程度不一的潔癖。\n\n\n\n  正是因為見識過太多的骯髒污穢，所以才更懂得珍惜「乾淨」。\n\n\n\n  「你真的不怪我？」男子有些欣喜道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，不怪你。」周澤點點頭，「你去好好上班過日子去吧，下次別犯錯了。」\n\n\n\n  「好，謝謝你，哥們兒，你是個實在人。」\n\n\n\n  男子重重地點點頭，離開了書店，去迎接他的「新生」去了。\n\n\n\n  而周澤則是拿起了手機，他想了想，覺得還是得報個警，不是以對方殺自己（徐樂）的事兒來報警，而是舉報對方涉嫌盜竊。\n\n\n\n  反正讓警察去查唄，如果對方真的有案底或者曾做過其他壞事兒被警方抓住了，也是他活該。\n\n\n\n  自己占據了人家的身體，總得替這個倒霉鬼做點什麼。\n\n\n\n  雖然，在對方良好認錯態度還給自己醫藥費的前提下，自己依舊實名舉報，確實挺缺德有點生兒子沒*****兒的意思。\n\n\n\n  只是，當周澤剛剛撥通了110，那邊接線台的聲音剛傳來時， \n\n\n\n  店門口，\n\n\n\n  那個傢伙忽然又去而復返。\n\n\n\n  「還有件事兒…………」對方剛走進來，就看見拿著手機的周澤，他愣了一下，直接伸手指著周澤，「你他娘的還是要報警對不對！」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「把手機給我看一下，給我！」\n\n\n\n  周澤只能繼續搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「你說話不算數，王八蛋，老子弄死你！我看你這次死不死！」\n\n\n\n  男子瞬間進入了激動亢奮的狀態，他的精神應該有一點點的問題，可能是長期處於賭徒生活節奏和社會脫鉤的關係吧，他往往容易因為某件事的刺激而進入極端。\n\n\n\n  對方撲了過來，周澤放下手機，身體開始後退。\n\n\n\n  他前世是個醫生，不是拳手也沒練過功夫，這一世的身子也有些孱弱，論起面對面地打架，還真有些慌亂。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  男子將周澤撞擊後壓在了牆壁上，同時他的雙手開始死死地掐住周澤的脖頸。\n\n\n\n  「我讓你報警，我讓你報警，我讓你說話不算話，好，我就讓你死，讓你真的死，這次我要掐死你後再給你放血，我看你還死不死！」\n\n\n\n  男子咬牙切齒地吼道。 \n\n\n\n  可憐的書店行情，下午時分，別提顧客了，甚至門口連行人都沒幾個。\n\n\n\n  脖子那邊幾乎麻木了，也已經無法呼吸了，周澤在盡力地去掙扎，在掙扎的過程中，周澤的雙手指甲忽然變黑變長拉起來。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，周澤雙手抱住了對方的後背。\n\n\n\n  「嘶………………」\n\n\n\n  男子忽然打了一個哆嗦，冒起了白眼，直接放開了周澤的脖子，整個人倒退了幾步後撞倒了幾個書架，而後轟然倒地。\n\n\n\n  周澤得以脫困，伸手揉了揉自己的脖子，他之前其實並沒有太驚慌，畢竟，自己的指甲可是連地獄裡的惡鬼都能傷到，對付一個普通人，應該問題不大吧？\n\n\n\n  但這個指甲具體是什麼緣由有什麼用處，周澤還沒完全清楚，只知道應該是自己車禍前救治的老者「傳染」給自己的，\n\n\n\n  還真是，\n\n\n\n  得了灰指甲，一個傳染倆。\n\n\n\n  走上前，蹲了下來，周澤伸手在男子臉上拍了拍，還好，沒死，還有氣，周澤搖搖頭，拿起手機，重新報警。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  派出所做完了筆錄，警察同志讓周澤在小廳那邊等著，因為周澤舉報的事情有些邪性，說人家上門打算搶劫自己但結果被打暈的居然是「兇手」，而現在這位兇手還在醫院裡，得等他醒來才能做進一步地確定。 \n\n\n\n  不過，警察同志至少沒給周澤上手銬。\n\n\n\n  周澤旁邊蹲著一個中年男子，男子的左手被鎖在暖氣片上。\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，你牛叉啊，那貨是要搶你錢結果被你放倒了？」臉上有些邋遢的中年男子一邊說著一邊搓了搓自己滿是泥垢的長劉海，「真有我年輕時的那種范兒，對這種不開眼的毛賊，就得往死里揍！」\n\n\n\n  「喂，你給我老實點兒。」一名年輕的警察走過來呵斥道，「你這是入冬來第幾次偷電瓶車了？\n\n\n\n  我說啊，快過年了，你就不能安生點？或者找個工作正兒八經地賺點錢給家裡寄點？多大的人了都。」\n\n\n\n  「打工是不可能打工的，這輩子都不可能打工的，做生意又不會做，就是偷電瓶車電瓶才能維持的了生活這樣子，進看守所感覺就像回家一樣。\n\n\n\n  裡面個個都是人才，說話又好聽，我超喜歡裡面的！」\n\n\n\n  「哼。」年輕警察不想再搭理這貨了，直接轉身離開。\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，我剛那番感言咋樣？」油膩中年男對周澤拋了一個媚眼。\n\n\n\n  「挺有意思的。」周澤笑了笑。\n\n\n\n  「切格瓦拉是我的偶像，切格瓦拉，你知道是誰麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「我跟你說啊，這日子就得…………」油膩中年男愣了一下，目光看向了門口那邊，道：「額滴個龜龜，好漂亮啊，這是警察麼？」 \n\n\n\n  周澤側過頭看過去，在門口那邊有一個上身著藍色羽絨服下身穿長筒皮靴的女人和另外一名女警察一起向這邊走來。\n\n\n\n  「應該是警察吧。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  女人很漂亮，身材精緻，皮膚白皙，最重要的，還是她身上的那種氣質，最為加分。\n\n\n\n  「但沒穿警服啊。」油膩男子反駁道。\n\n\n\n  「可能是便衣吧。」周澤猜測道。\n\n\n\n  「你說得對，美女警花，嘖嘖，看來以後我還得多多進來了。」油膩中年男砸吧砸吧了嘴，意猶未盡的樣子，「要是能娶了她，折壽十年我都願意。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，壽元陽壽這種東西，他不敢再亂開玩笑了。\n\n\n\n  「你不同意？」油膩男見周澤搖頭，急道：「你這叫有眼無珠啊，這種女人，折壽十年換一個，絕對不虧的…………」\n\n\n\n  這時候，那名女警察和那位長靴女人一起走到了周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「徐樂，你妻子來領你走了，那邊調查清楚了，你沒事了。」女警察指了指周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「…………」油膩中年男。",

    "content": "警察同志，請問一下，我老婆叫什麼名字來著？\n\n\n\n  這個念頭只是在心裡想了一下，周澤也沒蠢到這個地步，但他是真的不清楚自己這個「老婆」真名叫什麼，這個年代，也很少有人用自己的真名做QQ名和微信名。\n\n\n\n  倒是油膩男子一臉哀怨地瞥了周澤一眼：兄弟，你不厚道啊，說好做彼此折翼天使的呢？\n\n\n\n  周澤也有些無奈的回瞥了一眼：我也很意外啊。\n\n\n\n  油膩男子低下了頭，嘆了口氣，小聲地呢喃道：「我做的餃子很好吃。」\n\n\n\n  「走吧。」\n\n\n\n  「老婆」很清冷地說道，然後，自己直接轉身往外走去。\n\n\n\n  周澤只能跟著一起過去。\n\n\n\n  她開著一輛卡宴，直接上了車。\n\n\n\n  周澤打開車門，坐入了副駕駛位置。\n\n\n\n  老實說，\n\n\n\n  有些尷尬。\n\n\n\n  如果那位倒霉鬼徐樂，他的夫妻和家庭生活能正常一點，那麼自己還真不至於現在這麼尬著，面對嬌妻的關心自己還能找一些藉口去解釋解釋，比如頭暈了一些東西好像記不清了這類的；\n\n\n\n  但這位明顯帶著一種冰山女神的范兒，好像完全不愛搭理自己的樣子，就算是從派出所領自己出來也只是例行公事一般。 \n\n\n\n  我家狗走丟了，被保安撿到，\n\n\n\n  我去把它領回來。\n\n\n\n  就是這種感覺。\n\n\n\n  女人發動了車子，她其實挺年輕的，應該和自己（徐樂）差不多年紀，比原本的周澤要小個好幾歲。\n\n\n\n  當車子開上高架路時，女人終於開口打破了沉默：\n\n\n\n  「沒事吧？」\n\n\n\n  「哦，我沒事。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  又是沉默。\n\n\n\n  女人覺得自己丈夫今天有些過於安靜了，但她沒那個意願去探究原因。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，女人的手機響了，她按了免提，車載音響里傳來了電話那頭的聲音：\n\n\n\n  「林醫生，青年中路那裡剛剛發生了一起校車碰撞事故，現在已經有傷者正在向我們醫院輸送，主任讓你趕緊回來。」\n\n\n\n  周澤微微一愣，\n\n\n\n  原來自己妻子也是一名醫生，\n\n\n\n  還有，\n\n\n\n  原來自己妻子姓「林」。\n\n\n\n  「我知道了，馬上回來。」女人掛斷了電話，直接在前面下了高架，然後在紅綠燈路口大轉彎，開向了醫院。\n\n\n\n  她沒問周澤是否要把你先送回家或者是讓周澤先下車自己打車回去，而是將車一路開進了崇川區人民醫院的停車場。 \n\n\n\n  老實說，周澤還真擔心她讓自己下車打車回家，想著到時候自己還得腆著臉問：\n\n\n\n  「老婆，咱家住哪兒來著，我忘了。」\n\n\n\n  就覺得很傻。\n\n\n\n  女人下了車，周澤也跟著一起下了車，女人進了醫院大樓上了電梯，周澤也跟著一起進了電梯，女人進了女更衣室，周澤……\n\n\n\n  周澤在過道邊長椅上坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  也就在這會兒，第一批車禍傷者被送來了，重傷一人，另外還有五個孩子傷勢也不輕。\n\n\n\n  看著自己的「老婆」換了白大褂就出來忙碌救治，\n\n\n\n  周澤只能坐在長椅上發著呆，\n\n\n\n  這感覺，有點像是媽媽上班把自己兒子帶著，媽媽在工作兒子就在旁邊看著，自己玩。\n\n\n\n  不過，\n\n\n\n  醫院特有的消毒水味道以及中央空調的悶熱感，還真是讓人懷念啊，熟悉的感覺。\n\n\n\n  前面就是急診室，重傷且生命垂危的似乎是一個女孩。\n\n\n\n  出事的是幼兒園校車，看著一個個小朋友在手術台上哭喊著疼痛，這畫面，確實挺讓人揪心的。\n\n\n\n  周澤抿了抿嘴唇，以往這個時候，自己肯定已經換好了衣服參與救治工作了，他是通城年輕一代最有名的外科醫生，而現在，自己只能當一個看客。 \n\n\n\n  這種感覺，很不舒服，但他只能忍著，而且這家人民醫院也算是通城明面上最好的醫院，醫生數量和質量也都毋庸置疑，他們應該能搞得定。\n\n\n\n  很快，下一批孩子也被送了過來，他們受的傷比較輕，只需要處理一下傷口或者進行簡單地包紮就可以了。\n\n\n\n  有交警專門守護在這層樓的入口處位置，一些收到通知的家長已經過來了，情緒很激動，但這個時候讓家長進來很可能會影響救治工作的展開，只能先把他們攔住。\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，站起身，走到樓道最里端窗台那邊，伸手把窗戶架高，然後從口袋裡摸出了煙，他是抽菸的，徐樂也是抽菸的，這時候倒也方便。\n\n\n\n  「叔叔，不能在醫院抽菸的哦。」\n\n\n\n  剛把菸頭咬在嘴裡，一道清脆的女童聲音就從周澤身後傳來。\n\n\n\n  周澤轉過身，看見一名身穿著百合裙子的小姑娘站在自己身後，嘴巴嘟起來，氣鼓鼓地看著自己。\n\n\n\n  咳咳，\n\n\n\n  有些尷尬啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤只能將煙收起來，不管怎麼樣，讓一個小姑娘教育自己要遵守公德心總是有些難為情的。\n\n\n\n  「小朋友，你穿這麼點不冷麼？」周澤彎下腰問道。\n\n\n\n  小姑娘皮膚很精緻，臉上點著點嬰兒肥，大眼睛，很可愛，像是一個放大版的芭比娃娃。 \n\n\n\n  「不冷呢。」小姑娘搖搖頭，「叔叔，以後不能再在醫院抽菸哦。」\n\n\n\n  「我知道了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤很認真地點頭。\n\n\n\n  「你沒事吧？」周澤又問道。\n\n\n\n  「我沒事，其他小朋友都受傷了，他們很疼呢。」\n\n\n\n  小姑娘側過身，看向自己身後那些正在被包紮傷口的小朋友，大部分都在哭，其實倒不是因為疼痛難忍，而是有一個人在哭其他人也就跟著一起哭起來。\n\n\n\n  護士們一邊做著傷口處理一邊還要哄孩子，\n\n\n\n  外面被交警暫時攔住的家長們在外面不停地吵鬧罵人，\n\n\n\n  總之，\n\n\n\n  這一層樓，給人一種亂糟糟的感覺。\n\n\n\n  「那你可真幸運。」周澤感嘆道。\n\n\n\n  小姑娘身上連一處疤痕都沒有。\n\n\n\n  「恩呢，我坐在最後一排，所以沒事。」小姑娘點點頭，然後主動跑去那邊安慰她的同學去了，這個看看，那邊瞅瞅，還鼓勵他們安撫他們。\n\n\n\n  挺懂事也挺堅強的一個孩子。\n\n\n\n  周澤轉過身，下意識間又將煙取了出來，想想還是又放了回去。\n\n\n\n  重新走回長椅那邊坐下來時，前面的急救室里，走出來三名護士還有兩名醫生。 \n\n\n\n  一位男醫生一位女醫生，女醫生也就是自己的老婆。\n\n\n\n  「沒事的，我們盡力了。」男醫生說著伸手想要搭住周澤老婆的肩膀去安慰。\n\n\n\n  作為丈夫，\n\n\n\n  周澤就坐在這裡，\n\n\n\n  但他對這一幕並不反感……\n\n\n\n  坑爹的徐樂給自己留下這麼複雜的一個坑，又是上門女婿，又是脾氣極大的小姨子和脾氣明顯不好的丈母娘丈人。\n\n\n\n  周澤巴不得自己這個老婆趕緊紅杏出牆踹了自己和自己離婚然後自己一個人去靜靜。\n\n\n\n  換誰剛死而復生進入一具新的身體裡，都懶得去折騰什麼現代都市的贅婿生活百味吧？\n\n\n\n  不過，讓周澤有些意外的是，自己老婆竟然直接伸手擋開了那位醫生的鹹魚手，直接指著他道：\n\n\n\n  「這是我丈夫。」\n\n\n\n  話語裡沒有絲毫柔情蜜意，簡單，生硬，像是在說：這是我家養的哈士奇。\n\n\n\n  「哦，你好，先生。」那位男醫生臉色有些尷尬，不管怎麼樣，當著人家的面撩人家老婆總是那麼一點點沒底氣。\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，算是打了招呼。看來，自家媳婦兒很守婦道……但他怎麼都高興不起來，倒不是什麼綠帽情節作祟，\n\n\n\n  只是單純的，生活簡單點多好。 \n\n\n\n  「我去那邊再看看，其他孩子都處理好了，應該沒什麼事了，你早點和你先生回去休息。」這位男醫生說完後就走開了。\n\n\n\n  林醫生則是在周澤旁的長椅上坐了下來，她摘下了口罩，脫去了手套，丟在了地上。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見她的眼圈有些泛紅，貝齒輕咬著嘴唇，顯然，她的心情很不好，這意味著那位重傷的小朋友，沒能救回來。\n\n\n\n  這一副樣子，很『我見猶憐』。\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡有些理解徐樂了，這個上門女婿至少比其他同行要賺不少，老丈人家條件比自己好這是前提，之後這位林醫生，真的確實是好看。\n\n\n\n  「別往心裡去，以後要經歷得多呢，求一個心安就好。」\n\n\n\n  周澤作為過來人在旁邊安慰道，他的經驗比自己這位「老婆」豐富很多，心理承受能力自然也強大很多。\n\n\n\n  「閉嘴。」\n\n\n\n  女人回了這兩個字，如果是以周澤原本作為前輩的身份來說這種話，確實是勸導；\n\n\n\n  但周澤現在是徐樂，以他的形象來對林醫生說這種話，就是純粹站著說話不腰疼了。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤聳聳肩膀，再度在心裡鄙視了一把那位徐樂，看你慫的，你老婆敢在外面直接叫你閉嘴。\n\n\n\n  林醫生紅著眼，慢慢地站起來：「我去換衣服，回家。」 \n\n\n\n  「好。」周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  這時候，有兩名護士將急救室的帘子拉開，露出了裡面的病床，床上躺著一個小身體，蓋著白布。\n\n\n\n  周澤目光掃了一眼，死者他見得多了，自己從醫這些年來，救活的人很多，但就在自己面前無能為力只能死去的病人也不少。\n\n\n\n  「林醫生，這是你丈夫吧？」一名小護士以調侃的意味問道，她們是知道林醫生已經結婚了的，但林醫生的丈夫和其他女醫生女護士的男友不同，從沒來醫院露過面。\n\n\n\n  你不能指責她們在面對死亡時還能開個玩笑，這就像是你讓那些去一次西藏就發朋友圈說自己心靈被淨化好感動好虔誠的小清新長年累月在那裡待十年他們也受不了一樣，不現實。\n\n\n\n  「是。」林醫生點頭應道，這時候，她的情緒也平復了一些。\n\n\n\n  「那你們趕緊回去吧，說不定回去要有什麼活動呢，您說是吧？\n\n\n\n  我跟你說，咱林醫生可喜歡小孩子啦，你們抓緊回家去…………」\n\n\n\n  「艹！」\n\n\n\n  「…………」小護士。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了白布外面露出了百合裙裙邊，腦子「轟」的一聲，猛然意識到自己剛剛見到的那位毫髮無傷的小女孩，\n\n\n\n  她不是人！",
