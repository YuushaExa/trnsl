    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly lifted his head, looking at himself in the mirror, slightly haggard. As an Emergency Room doctor, this weariness seemed like a standard feature.\n\n“Doctor Zhou, a new patient will be here soon. It looks like they fell from upstairs, not sure if it was a suicide!” Nurse Wang Ya called out from the entrance of the men’s restroom.\n\n“Got it, I’ll be right there.” Zhou Ze replied, then pulled out a tissue to wipe off the water droplets and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an elderly man in a gray Tang suit. The old man coughed incessantly, occasionally coughing up bloody froth and spleen organ fragments. His entire body was covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient’s condition, and at the same time shouted to those ahead, “Prepare surgical instruments, quick!”\n\nThe patient’s condition was very bad.\n\n“I… I… don’t want to die.”\n\nThe old man opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n“Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. We’ll help you, you won’t die.”\n\nMost critically ill patients say these kinds of things at such a moment; those who can truly face death calmly are, after all, a minority. And as a doctor, this is certainly not the time to analyze the illness with the patient and tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n“No… no… down there… down there… it’s really too terrifying down there…”\n\nThe old man suddenly gripped Zhou Ze’s wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n“Calm down, relax, your life won’t be in danger.” Although his wrist was throbbing with pain, Zhou Ze still didn’t try to pull away.\n\n“I don’t want to… don’t want to go down there again… They… they found me… I… they found me…”\n\n“Hiss…” Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n“Doctor Zhou, your hand!” The young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe old man’s fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, they were black, a translucent black similar to amber, not like dirt had accumulated inside;\n\nAnd at this moment, the old man’s fingernails had already dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze’s wrist.\n\n“I’m not going down… not going down… not going down… Haha… cough, cough, cough…”\n\nThe old man suddenly straightened up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, the hand that had been gripping Zhou Ze’s loosened, and he became completely still.\n\n“Prepare for resuscitation!” Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the Emergency Room. Doctors and nurses began rescue procedures, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n“Doctor Zhou, let me take care of your wound.” Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren’t actually worried about minor flesh wounds. Their greatest concern was the possibility of the old man having other diseases, which could put the doctors at risk of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the old man’s hands just now, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, if contracted even slightly, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the Emergency Room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person hadn't been saved.\n\nEveryone’s spirits were a bit low, but for them, this kind of thing was already commonplace, and they would adjust quickly.\n\n“Doctor Zhou, you should get an examination.” Wang Ya suggested.\n\n“No, I have something else tonight.” Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot and drove away.\n\nJust as the car drove under the Jianghai Avenue Viaduct, Zhou Ze’s phone rang.\n\n“Hello, this is Zhou Ze.”\n\n“Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.”\n\n“I’m sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I’m coming right away; please ask the children to wait for me a little longer.”\n\n“Okay, okay.” The other side quickly hung up the phone.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze pressed the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n“Honk!!!!!!!!!!”\n\nAnd at this very moment,\n\nA heavy-duty truck ran a red light and came roaring over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head to look at the dazzling high beams outside the car window,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n“Bang!”\n\nThe world spun upside down,\n\nThe small car, like a delicate piece of white paper, was directly sent flying by the heavy-duty truck, tumbling several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n…………\n\n“Ugh…”\n\nZhou Ze woke up,\n\nHe found his body completely unable to move, as if he were stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes wouldn’t open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he really wanted to check his injuries right away, but he couldn’t move.\n\nAround him, there were occasional sounds of other vehicles driving past, and various horn honks.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of police sirens came, and also fire trucks,\n\nFinally, the familiar sound of an ambulance siren reached Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a bit high; they must be cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his trunk and the orphanage children’s Children’s Day party would have to be canceled.\n\n“Doctor Zhou!”\n\nA familiar voice calling him.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered a sudden, unexpected calamity.\n\nThere were also a few nurses’ voices nearby, but because it was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn’t hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, a single sentence from Doctor Chen made Zhou Ze’s heart plummet!\n\n“Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.”\n\nNo,\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nI’m not dead yet!\n\nI’m not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn’t dead, he was still conscious, he wasn’t dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze sensed someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression, but he couldn’t open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn’t dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn’t dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying voices of several nurses he knew,\n\nDoctor Chen punched a nearby car door, appearing very distraught.\n\nHey!\n\nDon’t give up!\n\nPlease don’t give up!\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of suspended animation,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I’m really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his mind.\n\nBut next, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher, presumably being put into the ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, came the sound of the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded particularly harsh in Zhou Ze’s ears,\n\nHe wasn’t dead yet,\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nWhy cry!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leadership speaking:\n\n“Young Zhou just… gone like that?”\n\n“The car accident was very severe. Doctor Zhou was excessively injured, lost too much blood, and has been confirmed dead.”\n\n“Really? He’s just gone?” Another vice-president still didn’t believe it.\n\n“Young Zhou is gone.” This was a department head’s voice. “I just checked again.”\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nYou bunch of incompetent doctors!\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nYou bunch of bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, his friends, nor his superiors and elders,\n\nThey had actually declared him dead,\n\nBut can dead people still hear sounds and perceive things?\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nYou bunch of bastards,\n\nYou beasts,\n\nYou mongrels!\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n“Wang Ya, don’t be too sad. The president said the hospital would hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.”\n\n“Sister Suqin, I just can’t believe it, someone is just… gone like that. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?”\n\n“Just as the weather is unpredictable, so too is human fortune. Just try to see things more openly.”\n\nAfter the two nurses finished speaking, they left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze struggled relentlessly, constantly trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut the feeling he had now was like sleep paralysis; no matter how hard he tried, his body was simply beyond his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair,\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted,\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nAt the hospital’s,\n\nMorgue.\n\n………………\n\nWhen Zhou Ze “woke up” again, he sensed a faint coolness on his face, and a stinging sensation was also very clear.\n\n“Is the makeup done yet?” Someone nearby asked.\n\n“Don’t rush, wait a moment. He was hit so badly, how could the makeup be done so quickly?”\n\n“The hospital is rushing us; they’re about to send him to the memorial service.”\n\n“Why don’t you do it then?”\n\nThe mortuary makeup artist seemed a bit angry and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people; dead people naturally wouldn’t feel pain, nor would they complain. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle,\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush constantly pressing down on his face,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n“Alright, call them in. Our work here is done.”\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being dressed. Immediately after, he was pushed out, and the hospital orderlies lifted him into a soft, confined space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be an ice coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly cut off,\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nRocking,\n\nBumping…\n\nAfter an unknown period, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again; the ice coffin lid must have been opened.\n\nWhat reached his ears,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe hospital president was speaking into a microphone, praising him and expressing regret for his loss,\n\nThen came the vice-president, department head, and others.\n\nAround him,\n\nThere were occasional sounds of footsteps,\n\nSome simply walked past quietly, taking a last look at him,\n\nOthers tried to call out his name a few times, with choked voices,\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy remains!\n\nI’m not dead,\n\nI’m really not dead,\n\nI’m not dead yet!\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe began to try again,\n\nBut still couldn’t,\n\nHe could only hear and feel,\n\nBut couldn’t speak,\n\nNor open his eyes,\n\nEveryone believed he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew clearly,\n\nHe wasn’t dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying beside him.\n\nThey cried sincerely because Zhou Ze himself was a child who came out of an orphanage. Therefore, after starting work, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident also happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage that evening to celebrate Children’s Day with the children.\n\n“Young Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but your compensation will be given to the orphanage, rest assured.” The vice-president said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again; the ice coffin lid must have been closed once more.\n\nThen came another bout of bumping,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe ice coffin lid was opened again,\n\nAround him, it was somewhat quiet. Occasionally, he heard human voices, but they weren’t noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and one holding his legs, lifted him up, then placed him on another cold rack, which felt like a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, there were faint, indistinct sobs.\n\nZhou Ze initially couldn’t discern where he had been brought this time,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood,\n\nBastards!\n\nThey had sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI’m not dead, you bastards!\n\nFuck your ancestors!\n\nI’m not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon’t cremate me,\n\nDon’t cremate me!\n\nI’m really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou bunch of beasts,\n\nYou mongrels!\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis time, it was Zhou Ze’s most desperate outburst, his most frantic one,\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no room left at all!\n\nHe would directly face death!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he truly was unwilling. He was not yet thirty years old, he hadn’t started a family, he didn’t have children, he still had a life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n“Mommy, I just saw this uncle’s hand move.” A little girl’s timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n“Smack!” A little smack landed on her mouth.\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense! I’ll deal with you when we get home.” The girl’s mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how he struggled,\n\nHow he roared in his mind,\n\nThe people outside couldn’t perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was utterly terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI’m not dead, I’m really not dead!\n\nDon’t burn me!\n\nDon’t burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being grief-stricken,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this procedure,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing life tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being pushed into a narrow place filled with the smell of oil residue,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA viscous liquid sprayed onto his body,\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n“Sizzle…”\n\nHot!\n\nExtremely hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBlazing fire,\n\nFire everywhere…………",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

For Zhou Ze, the entire world at this moment was his prison, and a black cloth had been draped over that prison.\n\nNo one could see him,\nand no one could communicate with him.\nHe couldn't pick up anything tangible,\neven,\nthe wind could easily blow right through him.\nHe was so frail;\nthe term \"weak as a willow\" was truly not an exaggeration for him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that\nhe could see faint specks of light constantly dissipating from his body.\nIn other words,\nhis body was slowly fading.\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would completely disappear, the last insignificant trace of him erased.\nHe didn't know how all this happened, but he knew that he really didn't have much time left.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li entered the body of a person who had starved to death and collapsed, which is how he gained the image passed down through generations.\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return to life\"[^1]. He also wanted to \"borrow a corpse to return to life.\" He was very cold and panicked; he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\nHe didn't even care who this person was.\nPeople are always selfish at times like these, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't stand it anymore.\nHowever, whenever he tried to approach someone, lights and fires would appear above their heads and on their shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even suffered harm because of this, accelerating his \"evaporation\" speed.\n\nHe was a bit tired, a bit numb.\nHe was waiting for his end,\nwaiting for his demise.\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him a little more at ease.\nMoreover, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would endure torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\nAhead, a storefront was still lit up. It seemed to be a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\nSomeone pushed open the door from inside and walked out. It was a man wearing a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his face wasn't clear. He looked left and right for a while, then left in a hurry.\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze, who was standing less than five meters away from him.\nOriginally, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\nYes,\na warm aura.\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel somewhat inexplicable, but he was currently like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly found a box of matches; even knowing the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last bit of warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body passing directly through the bookstore's glass door, continuing further inside, and arriving behind the bookstore's bookshelves.\nBehind the bookshelves,\nlay a person.\nIt was a handsome young man, probably twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the shop, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\nHe was lying on the ground, but on him, Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling, like a pauper finding a bag of gold coins while walking on the road at night.\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, in his current state, had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and squatted down in front of the young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to make contact with the warmth he needed.\nOne hand reached out and was placed on the other's chest.\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embed themselves into the other person's body.\nThis was a very strange feeling, different from the \"breeze\" blowing through his body when he walked down the street earlier. This was a fusion, a merging using his fingernails as a medium.\nSlowly, Zhou Ze himself began to enter the other's body, and the two began to overlap.\n\n………………\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\nZhou Ze was awakened by a series of shoves. No, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his hands previously propped on it.\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, carrying an air of command.\nRaising his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, to be precise, it should be a girl, probably high-school aged. Although she was a big girl, she still had a touch of childishness.\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what exactly do you mean? You've gotten bold, haven't you? Trying to make my parents and my sister lose face, aren't you? You actually dared not come home all night last night!\nWho gave you such guts!\"\nXu Le?\nWho is that?\nZhou Ze spread his hands out in a daze, finding his hands smooth. His own hands used to have calluses from long hours of practicing with surgical instruments, but these hands had none.\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\nThe girl slammed her palm on the counter, full of aggression.\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection, an unfamiliar face. No, he had seen this face before; it was the face he had seen last night.\nThis body,\nis it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are really angry, and my mom is throwing a fit at home. Let me tell you, everything you eat, drink, and use now comes from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\nWho are you trying to put on a show for?!\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe it or not, I'll come over and smack you!\"\nThe girl made to raise her palm, but she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg for mercy as usual. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\nAt this moment, she checked the time and found it was already half past seven.\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school first. I'll settle with you tonight!\"\nThe girl left angrily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down on the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a cell phone next to it.\nEven now, he still hadn't adapted to the process of his identity change.\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\nAs a result,\nhe now had this identity.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nI'm... a live-in son-in-law?\nHave a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\nMoreover, looking at the attitude and tone his sister-in-law used when speaking to her \"brother-in-law,\" his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient traditions.\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly referred to as someone who \"marries into the wife's family\" or *daocha men*[^2], was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times, with a status similar to that of a criminal. During the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced into border garrisons often included such sons-in-law, or *zhuixu*[^3].\n\nPicking up the phone, he found it wasn't password-protected. He didn't know if the guy was lazy or didn't dare set a password, but at least it made it easy for Zhou Ze to open his WeChat and QQ.\nThe QQ contact list was sparse, just a few middle school, high school, and university classmates. Then there was a family list with only one person, noted as \"Wife.\"\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her: empty.\nAll right,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to find her, locating the woman noted as \"Wife.\" Here, there were replies, mostly Xu Le asking about things like what to eat tonight, what needed to be prepared tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how her health was, and a whole bunch of other things.\nThe other person's replies were often perfunctory and cold,\nsuch as:\n\"Oh.\"\n\"Mm.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nused as replies.\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails were no different from an ordinary person's.\nBut in the events leading up to his car accident, his rescue of the elder, his escape from the faceless woman, and his entry into this guy's body—his fingernails had played an extremely crucial role in all these matters.\n\nWith a thought,\nat this moment,\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly growing longer, and at the same time, becoming black and translucent. Faint dark mist even swirled around them.\n\"Hoo...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nclosed his eyes,\nand when he opened them again,\nhis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort brought by his identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, unsure if he'd forgotten or simply didn't feel hungry.\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's former home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District; the distance wasn't far.\nBy the afternoon, Zhou Ze finally sighed, silently stood up, and decided to make the best of it.\nHe began trying to dust the bookshelves. In any case, he might as well find something to do for himself.\nThe elder who had choked him before his death had said \"he's been discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said \"you'll be caught sooner or later,\" which generated a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze's heart.\nHis current state could be considered \"barely living\"[^4]. To return from the dead was a heavenly blessing[^5], so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to embrace this identity, and it would be best not to cause too much anomaly or attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this shop was truly bad. The slump in the traditional book market hadn't been a one-day or two-day affair, and this place wasn't on the prime commercial street right outside a school.\nOne could only say that Xu Le's choice to open a bookstore here was questionable; whether it could even break even was doubtful.\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\nThe customer was browsing in the children's books section, and had been browsing for a long time.\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What kind of topic are you looking for?\"\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't understand either.\n\"Just looking,\" the other person replied.\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze then ignored him, as he hadn't yet fully integrated into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\nBut at this moment,\nthe other person suddenly walked behind him and said eerily,\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and robbed you of your money,\nAnd I even specifically checked,\nyou clearly had no breath left then.\"\n\n---\n[^1]: *jiè shī huán hún* (借屍還魂): A Chinese idiom meaning \"to borrow a corpse to return to life,\" referring to a spirit or soul entering a dead body to revive it.\n[^2]: *daocha men* (倒插門): A colloquial term for a live-in son-in-law, literally \"inverted door-inserting,\" referring to the groom moving into the bride's family home, a reversal of traditional marriage customs.\n[^3]: *zhuixu* (贅婿): A formal term for a live-in son-in-law, often implying a lower social status, sometimes even compared to indentured servitude.\n[^4]: *gǒu huó* (苟活): To barely live, to linger on, to survive precariously.\n[^5]: *yāo tiān zhī xìng* (邀天之倖): A stroke of divine luck; a heavenly blessing or fortune.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze paused. So, last night, the reason he could take Xu Le's body through soul-transference¹ was because Xu Le had just been killed?\n\nBecause the body was still warm, he could enter?\n\nLooking at it this way, he seemed quite lucky.\n\nWithout revulsion, or anger, nor panic at the possibility of his identity being exposed, Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the man, who was about the same age as himself.\n\nThe man paused.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes:\n\nIt was joy,\n\nIt was relief,\n\nAnd even,\n\nA little bit of admiration.\n\nAs a host, in last night's situation, Zhou Ze clearly understood the difficult predicament he faced. If this guy hadn't just happened to kill someone at that moment, his soul would have been scattered, and he would never have seen the sun today.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night, and my head feels really uncomfortable this morning, like I'm drunk, so I've forgotten what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze casually explained.\n\nHe didn't think the other person would guess he was a ghost who had possessed a body, unless the other person was out of his mind.\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The other person pointed at his nose, sounding a bit absurd, \"Even though I've already told you that I clubbed you yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine, actually, I should thank you for not taking my phone and computer from my desk.\"\n\n\"That... I forgot.\" The man scratched his head. \"It's good that you're okay. This is the money I robbed from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then rummaged around and pulled out another eight hundred yuan.\n\n\"Eight hundred yuan is for your medical expenses, and three hundred is what I robbed yesterday.\" The man pursed his lips. \"Yesterday, I gambled online and lost all my salary to the bookie. Passing by your bookstore, I suddenly wanted to get some money. After I knocked you down, I realized you had no breath, and I was scared to death.\n\nAfter running home, I couldn't sleep all night, just thinking if the police would suddenly break down the door and arrest me. Home invasion, robbery, and murder, and I only took three hundred yuan. I felt so foolish, so not worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\n\"Buddy, it's so good you didn't die, really. I've been wandering outside since morning, waiting for someone to report it, waiting for the police to come. But then I saw you were actually still in the bookstore.\n\nYou know, at that moment, I almost knelt down and kowtowed to you. Thank you. You're tough; you didn't die. Otherwise, I would have been finished. There are so many cameras here; if you had died, I definitely wouldn't have been able to escape.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, then at the \"murderer\" in front of him, who was repenting with tears in his eyes. He felt that the scene was very strange.\n\nTo be honest, Xu Le was dead. Because he died, Zhou Ze could take over his body. And because Zhou Ze took over his body, this guy in front of him was spared from murder charges.\n\nBoth Zhou Ze and this guy benefited. Only Xu Le, the unlucky one.\n\n\"Alright, it's fine. Maybe I just got winded last night.\" Zhou Ze moved the other person's hand off his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor; what kind of filth hadn't he seen? But in that extreme environment, he developed a slight germophobia. In fact, most emergency doctors have varying degrees of germophobia.\n\nIt was precisely because he had seen too much dirt and filth that he understood how to cherish \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" The man said, a bit elated.\n\n\"No, I don't blame you.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"You go to work and live your life well. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy. You're a straightforward guy.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily, left the bookstore, and went to greet his \"new life.\"\n\nZhou Ze then picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he still needed to call the police, not to report the other party for killing him (Xu Le), but to report them for suspected theft.\n\nAnyway, let the police investigate. If the other party really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and was caught by the police, it was what he deserved.\n\nHe had occupied someone else's body, so he ought to do something for that unlucky guy.\n\nAlthough, given the other party's good attitude in admitting his mistake and even paying for medical expenses, reporting him by name was indeed quite unethical, a bit like having a son without an anus*.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the operator's voice came through,\n\nAt the shop entrance,\n\nThat guy suddenly returned.\n\n\"One more thing...\" The other party had just walked in when he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He paused, then pointed directly at Zhou Ze, \"You son of a bitch, you're still going to call the police, aren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone, give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You went back on your word, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly entered an agitated, excited state. His mind must have a slight problem, perhaps due to a long-term gambler's lifestyle and being out of touch with society. He often became extreme when stimulated by something.\n\nThe other party pounced over. Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to retreat.\n\nIn his previous life, he was a doctor, not a boxer or martial artist. This body was also a bit frail. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was indeed a bit flustered.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man crashed into Zhou Ze, pinning him against the wall, while his hands began to desperately strangle Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I'll let you call the police, I'll let you call the police, I'll let you break your word! Fine, I'll let you die, let you really die! This time I'll strangle you to death and then drain your blood! Let's see if you still die!\"\n\nThe man growled through clenched teeth.\n\nThe pitiful bookstore business: in the afternoon, let alone customers, there weren't even many pedestrians outside the door.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. As he struggled, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and elongated.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his hands around the other person's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, rolled his eyes, and immediately let go of Zhou Ze's neck. He stumbled back a few steps, knocking over several bookshelves, and then collapsed to the ground.\n\nZhou Ze managed to break free and rubbed his neck. He hadn't been too panicked earlier. After all, his fingernails could even injure ghosts from hell. Dealing with an ordinary person shouldn't be a big problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze still wasn't entirely clear about the specific origin or use of these fingernails. He only knew they were likely \"contracted\" from the old man he saved before his car accident.\n\nIt really was,\n\nGot athlete's nail, one infects two**.\n\nHe stepped forward, crouched down, and patted the man's face. Thankfully, he wasn't dead, still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n***\n\nAfter finishing the statement at the police station, the police officer told Zhou Ze to wait in the waiting area, because the matter Zhou Ze reported was a bit unusual: he said someone came to rob him, but the one who got knocked out was actually the \"assailant,\" and this assailant was still in the hospital. They had to wait for him to wake up for further confirmation.\n\nHowever, the police officer at least didn't handcuff Zhou Ze.\n\nNext to Zhou Ze, a middle-aged man squatted, his left hand locked to a radiator.\n\n\"Brother, you're a badass! That guy tried to rob you, but you took him down?\" The grubby middle-aged man said, rubbing his long bangs that were full of grime. \"You really have that vibe from when I was young! For these reckless petty thieves, you gotta beat them senseless!\"\n\n\"Hey, you be honest with me.\" A young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. \"This is your how many times stealing electric scooter batteries since winter started?\n\nI'm telling you, Chinese New Year is coming soon, can't you just settle down? Or find a proper job and earn some money to send home? You're a big man now.\"\n\n\"Working is impossible; it's impossible to work in this life. I don't know how to do business. Stealing electric scooter batteries is the only way to make a living. Going to the detention center feels like coming home. Everyone inside is talented, and they speak so nicely. I really like it in there!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to bother with this guy anymore and simply turned to leave.\n\n\"Brother, how was my speech just now?\" The grubby middle-aged man winked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Quite interesting.\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol, Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"I'm telling you, life just has to be...\" The grubby middle-aged man paused, looking towards the doorway. He said, \"Holy cow! So beautiful! Is that a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the doorway, a woman in a blue down jacket and long leather boots was walking towards them with another female police officer.\n\n\"Probably a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, her aura was the biggest plus.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a police uniform,\" the grubby man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right, a beautiful police officer, tsk tsk, looks like I'll have to come in here more often in the future.\" The grubby middle-aged man smacked his lips, still wanting more. \"If I could marry her, I'd be willing to lose ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He didn't dare joke about lifespan anymore.\n\n\"You don't agree?\" The grubby man saw Zhou Ze shake his head and said anxiously, \"You're blind, you know! For a woman like that, losing ten years of your life is definitely not a loss...\"\n\nAt this moment, the female police officer and the woman in long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to pick you up. The investigation there is clear; you're fine now.\" The female police officer pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Grubby middle-aged man.\n\n---\n¹ Literally \"borrow a corpse to return a soul,\" a concept in Chinese folklore where a spirit possesses a recently deceased body.\n*   Literally \"giving birth to a son without an anus,\" a highly vulgar Chinese idiom used to describe someone utterly devoid of conscience or basic human decency, especially after receiving kindness.\n**   A humorous play on words using a famous Chinese advertising slogan for a common nail fungus medicine: \"Got athlete's nail, one infects two.\" Here, it's used to imply the \"infection\" of a special ability.",

    "content": "“Officer, excuse me, what was my wife’s name again?”\n\nThis thought just flashed through his mind; Zhou Ze wasn’t stupid enough for that. But he really didn’t know his “wife’s” real name. In this era, few people used their real names for QQ usernames and WeChat usernames.\n\nThe greasy man, however, cast a mournful glance at Zhou Ze: “Brother, that’s not cool. We agreed to be each other’s broken-winged angels, didn’t we?”¹\n\nZhou Ze returned the glance, a little helpless: “I’m surprised too.”\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, “My dumplings are delicious.”\n\n“Let’s go.”\n\nHis “wife” said coolly, then turned and walked straight out.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow.\n\nShe drove a Cayenne and got straight into the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car door and sat in the front passenger seat.\n\nHonestly,\n\nit was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unlucky soul, Xu Le, had a more normal marital and family life, Zhou Ze wouldn’t be in such an awkward spot right now. He could at least find some excuses to explain his situation when faced with his loving wife’s concern, something like “I felt a bit dizzy and can’t remember some things”;\n\nBut this one clearly had the vibe of an iceberg goddess, seemingly completely uninterested in engaging with him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like a mere formality.\n\n*My dog ran away, and the security guard found it,*\n*so I’m going to pick it up.*\n\nThat’s how it felt.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around his (Xu Le’s) age, several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car drove onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n“Are you okay?”\n\n“Oh, I’m fine,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence again.\n\nThe woman found her husband unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to explore why.\n\nJust then, the woman’s phone rang. She put it on speaker, and the voice from the other end came through the car’s audio system:\n\n“Doctor Lin, there’s just been a school bus collision near Qingnian Middle Road. Casualties are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you back urgently.”\n\nZhou Ze was slightly taken aback.\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor.\n\nAnd,\n\nhis wife’s surname was “Lin.”\n\n“I understand. I’ll be right back.” The woman hung up, immediately exited the elevated highway ahead, then made a wide turn at the traffic lights, heading towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn’t ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back; instead, she drove the car straight into the parking lot of Chongchuan District People’s Hospital.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze was actually worried she’d tell him to get out and take a taxi home. He imagined having to shamelessly ask then:\n\n“Honey, where do we live again? I forgot.”\n\nHe felt incredibly foolish just thinking about it.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got into the elevator, Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the women’s changing room, Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a long bench by the corridor.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived: one critically injured, and five other children with significant injuries.\n\nWatching his “wife” change into a white coat and immediately busy herself with treatment,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench, spacing out.\n\nIt felt a bit like a mother bringing her son to work, with the mother working and the son watching from the side, playing by himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe hospital’s unique smell of disinfectant and the stuffiness from the central air conditioning were truly nostalgic, a familiar feeling.\n\nThe emergency room was ahead. The critically injured and life-threatening patient seemed to be a girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus that had the accident. Watching one child after another cry out in pain on the operating table, the scene was truly gut-wrenching.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Usually, at this time, he would have already changed into his scrubs and participated in the rescue efforts. He was Tongcheng’s most renowned young surgeon, but now, he could only be an observer.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. Moreover, this People’s Hospital was openly considered Tongcheng’s best, and the number and quality of its doctors were unquestionable; they should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. Their injuries were minor, only requiring wound treatment or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were specifically guarding the entrance to this floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, highly agitated, but letting parents in at this time could potentially disrupt the treatment work, so they had to be stopped for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the windowsill at the far end of the corridor, reached out to prop the window open, then pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, which was convenient now.\n\n“Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital, you know.”\n\nJust as he bit down on the cigarette butt, a clear voice of a little girl came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, pouting and glaring at him indignantly.\n\nAhem,\n\na little awkward.\n\nZhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public etiquette was always a bit embarrassing.\n\n“Little one, aren’t you cold dressed like that?” Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a touch of baby fat on her face, large eyes, very cute, like an enlarged Barbie doll.\n\n“Not cold at all,” the little girl shook her head. “Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital anymore, okay?”\n\n“I know.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded earnestly.\n\n“Are you okay?” Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n“I’m fine. All the other children are hurt. They’re in a lot of pain.”\n\nThe little girl turned sideways, looking at the other children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying, not necessarily from unbearable pain, but rather because one person cried, and the others followed suit.\n\nNurses were both treating wounds and comforting the children,\n\nwhile parents, temporarily blocked by traffic police outside, continuously clamored and cursed.\n\nIn short,\n\nthis entire floor felt chaotic.\n\n“You’re truly lucky then,” Zhou Ze exclaimed.\n\nThe little girl didn’t even have a single scratch on her body.\n\n“Mmm-hmm, I was sitting in the back row, so I’m fine.” The little girl nodded, then proactively ran over to comfort her classmates, looking here and there, encouraging and soothing them.\n\nA very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, subconsciously pulled out a cigarette again, then thought better of it and put it back.\n\nWhen he walked back to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors emerged from the emergency room ahead.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor, the female doctor being his wife.\n\n“It’s okay, we did our best,” the male doctor said, reaching out to put a comforting hand on Zhou Ze’s wife’s shoulder.\n\nAs a husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nbut he wasn’t repulsed by this scene…\n\nThat damned Xu Le left him with such a complicated mess: a live-in son-in-law, a hot-tempered sister-in-law, and clearly ill-tempered in-laws.\n\nZhou Ze wished this wife of his would quickly have an affair³, kick him out, divorce him, and then he could just go and be alone.\n\nWho, after just dying and being reborn into a new body, would bother with all the complexities of a modern city’s live-in son-in-law life, right?\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze’s surprise, his wife directly blocked the doctor’s “wandering hand”⁴ with her own, pointing at him and saying:\n\n“This is my husband.”\n\nThere was no tenderness or affection in her words; they were simple, blunt, as if she were saying: “This is my pet husky.”\n\n“Oh, hello, sir.” The male doctor’s expression was a bit awkward. No matter what, trying to flirt with someone’s wife right in front of them always felt a little lacking in confidence.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, acknowledging him. It seemed his wife was quite dutiful⁵... but he couldn’t feel happy about it. It wasn’t some cuckoldry complex⁶ at play,\n\nHe simply thought, how much better if life were simpler.\n\n“I’ll go check over there again. The other children have all been taken care of, so there shouldn’t be any problems. You and your husband should go back and rest early.” The male doctor said, then walked away.\n\nDoctor Lin sat down on the long bench beside Zhou Ze. She removed her mask, took off her gloves, and threw them on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and she was gently biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a very bad mood, which meant the critically injured child couldn’t be saved.\n\nShe truly looked “pitifully endearing.”\n\nZhou Ze now somewhat understood Xu Le. This live-in son-in-law at least earned a lot more than his peers, with his in-laws’ financial situation being better than his own as a prerequisite. And then, this Doctor Lin, she truly was good-looking.\n\n“Don’t take it to heart. You’ll experience much more of this in the future. Just seek peace of mind.”\n\nZhou Ze, speaking from experience, comforted her. His experience was far richer than his “wife’s,” and his psychological resilience naturally much stronger.\n\n“Shut up.”\n\nThe woman replied with these two words. If Zhou Ze had said this in his original capacity as a senior colleague, it would indeed be advice;\n\nbut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le. For him, in Xu Le’s image, to say such things to Doctor Lin was pure armchair criticism.²\n\n“............” Zhou Ze shrugged, again internally scoffing at Xu Le. *Look how much of a wimp you are, your wife dares to tell you to shut up right out in the open.*\n\nDoctor Lin, eyes red, slowly stood up: “I’ll go change, then home.”\n\n“Okay,” Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nJust then, two nurses pulled open the emergency room curtain, revealing the bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered by a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze’s gaze swept over it. He had seen many dead people. In all his years as a doctor, he had saved many lives, but there were also plenty of patients he was powerless to help who died right in front of him.\n\n“Doctor Lin, is this your husband?” a young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Doctor Lin was married, but her husband, unlike the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses, had never shown his face at the hospital.\n\nYou couldn’t blame them for being able to joke even when facing death. It was like expecting those “hipsters”⁷ who go to Tibet once and post on Moments about their purified, touched, and devout souls to endure staying there for ten years; it was unrealistic.\n\n“Yes,” Doctor Lin nodded in response. By this time, her emotions had also somewhat calmed.\n\n“Well, you two should hurry back then. Who knows what activities you might have planned back home, right?\n\nLet me tell you, our Doctor Lin really loves children, so you two should hurry home and get to it...”\n\n“Shit!”\n\n“............” The young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze saw the hem of a lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind went “boom,” and he suddenly realized that the unscathed little girl he had just seen,\n\nShe wasn’t human!\n\n---\n¹ “Broken-winged angels”: An idiom often used to describe two people who are both in a difficult or unfortunate situation, sharing their misery.\n² “Armchair criticism”: An idiom meaning to criticize a situation without having personal experience or responsibility in it, or to give advice from a position of comfort and lack of understanding.\n³ “Have an affair”: The Chinese idiom “红杏出墙” (hóng xìng chū qiáng), literally “red apricot tree leaning over the wall,” refers to a wife having an extramarital affair.\n⁴ “Wandering hand”: The Chinese slang “咸鱼手” (xiányú shǒu), literally “salty fish hand,” refers to an unwelcome or inappropriate touch, often from someone attempting to grope.\n⁵ “Dutiful”: The Chinese idiom “守妇道” (shǒu fù dào) describes a woman who adheres to traditional wifely virtues, particularly fidelity and obedience.\n⁶ “Cuckoldry complex”: The Chinese idiom “绿帽情结” (lǜmào qíngjié), literally “green hat complex,” refers to the psychological distress or humiliation experienced by a man whose wife has cheated on him.
