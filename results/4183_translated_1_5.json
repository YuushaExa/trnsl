    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head, looking at himself in the mirror. He looked a little haggard. As an emergency room doctor, this haggardness seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. It seems they fell from upstairs. Not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called out from the doorway of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there.\" Zhou Ze replied, then took out a paper towel to dry the water droplets and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance soon drove into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an old man in a gray Tang suit. The old man was coughing continuously, occasionally spitting out bloody foam and fragments of spleen along with it, his whole body covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition, and shouted to the people in front, \"Prepare the surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We will help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say such things at this time. Few can truly face death calmly. As a doctor, this is not the time to analyze the condition and tell the patient their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too scary...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly grabbed Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at Zhou Ze with a solemn expression.\n\n\"Calm down, relax. Your life will be fine.\" Although his wrist was starting to hurt, Zhou Ze didn't try to break free.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down anymore... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately exclaimed.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were long, and for some unknown reason, his fingernails were black. They were a transparent black, like amber, not like accumulated dirt.\n\nAt this moment, the old man's fingernails had already embedded themselves into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down anymore... not going down... not going down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, his hand that was holding Zhou Ze dropped, and he became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room, and doctors and nurses began to carry out resuscitation measures, with the defibrillator also ready.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me tend to your wound.\" Wang Ya walked over at this time.\n\nAs doctors, they were not actually worried about this minor flesh wound. What they were most worried about was the possibility that if the old man had other diseases, it might put the doctors at risk of occupational exposure. After all, the old man's hands were covered in blood just now, and no one knew if he had any contagious diseases.\n\nSome illnesses, once contracted, could ruin a person's life.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor came out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person could not be saved.\n\nEveryone felt a bit disappointed, but for them, this was something they were accustomed to, and they would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let's do a check-up.\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, went directly to the locker room to change his clothes, and then drove out of the hospital parking lot.\n\nAs soon as the car drove under the Jianghai Avenue overpass, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu. A patient caused a delay. I'll be there immediately. Please ask the children to wait for me a little longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other side quickly hung up the phone.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"BEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and came barreling through. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head to look at the blinding high beams outside the car window.\n\nThen,\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, in front of the heavy truck, was like a delicate piece of white paper, directly sent flying. After tumbling several times in the air, it crashed to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up.\n\nHe found that his body couldn't move at all, as if it were trapped.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional instinct, he wanted to check his injuries right away, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he could hear the sounds of other vehicles passing by, as well as various car horns.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of police sirens could be heard, as well as the sound of fire trucks.\n\nFinally, the sound of an ambulance siren, which felt familiar to Zhou Ze, reached him.\n\nZhou Ze sensed that his body was being moved. The temperature around him was slightly high, suggesting that they were cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a shame, the cake in my trunk, and the Children's Day party for the orphanage, it all has to be canceled.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt should be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze sighed in relief in his heart. At least he had saved his life. This could be considered a sudden disaster.\n\nThere were also the voices of several nurses nearby. Because it was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, a sentence from Dr. Chen made Zhou Ze's heart plummet to the bottom!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze shouted desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze sensed someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would realize he wasn't dead soon!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the sobbing voices of some familiar nurses,\n\nDr. Chen punched a nearby car door, looking very grief-stricken.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nPlease don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of suspended animation right now,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSeverely injured?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his heart.\n\nBut then, he sensed that he was being lifted onto a stretcher, presumably being transported into an ambulance.\n\nFollowing that, came the sound of the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the carriage were still crying.\n\nBut these cries were particularly jarring to Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy are they crying!\n\nWhy are they crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leadership speaking:\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone just like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very serious. Dr. Zhou was severely injured and died of excessive blood loss, confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's gone just like that?\" Another vice president still couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bunch of quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bunch of scoundrels!\n\nScoundrels!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his leaders and elders.\n\nThey actually pronounced him dead,\n\nBut can the dead hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bunch of scoundrels,\n\nBeasts,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to be pushed, and the surroundings were quiet, with the temperature gradually decreasing.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said there will be a memorial service for Dr. Zhou at the hospital tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Su Qin, I just find it hard to believe that a person is gone just like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he be gone like this.\"\n\n\"The weather is unpredictable, and life is full of changes. Just try to look on the bright side.\"\n\nAfter saying these words, the two nurses left.\n\nAround him,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, desperately trying to resist, wanting to wake up, desperately wanting to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like being sleep-paralyzed. No matter how hard he tried, his body simply wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair.\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and the stinging sensation was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done yet?\" someone asked from nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush. Wait a minute. His whole body was smashed like this, how can the makeup be done so quickly.\"\n\n\"The hospital is already urging us. They need to send him to the mourning hall right away.\"\n\n\"Why don't you come and do it?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a little angry and applied more force while doing the makeup. Of course, their clients were dead people, and dead people naturally wouldn't complain about pain, nor would they receive complaints. They only needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush being pressed repeatedly on his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, call them in. Our job is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being dressed, and then he was pushed out. The hospital attendant lifted him and placed him in a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nShould be an ice coffin.\n\nThen, all the noise around was instantly isolated.\n\nThe lid should have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nOscillating,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the ice coffin should have been opened.\n\nWhat reached his ears,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe principal was speaking into a microphone, praising him, and lamenting him.\n\nThen it was the vice president and the directors, and so on.\n\nAround him,\n\nThere were occasional footsteps passing by,\n\nSome people just walked by quietly, taking a last look at him,\n\nSome even tried to call out to him a few times, with choked voices.\n\nThis was paying respects to the deceased's remains.\n\nPaying respects,\n\nTo my remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe started trying again,\n\nBut still couldn't.\n\nHe could only hear, and feel,\n\nBut couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes.\n\nEveryone believed he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came and cried beside him.\n\nTheir crying was very sincere, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who had come from an orphanage. Therefore, after starting his job, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. The car accident this time was because he was rushing back to the orphanage at night to spend Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. This time, it's considered an accident in the line of duty. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation to the orphanage. Don't worry.\" The vice president said beside Zhou Ze.\n\nAfterward,\n\nZhou Ze sensed that he was being isolated again. The lid of the ice coffin should have been closed again.\n\nThen there was more bumping,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the ice coffin was opened again,\n\nAround, it was rather quiet, with occasional human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and the other his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, seemingly a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, very, very skilled.\n\nAround, there were faint sounds of crying.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't figure out where he had arrived at first,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood.\n\nBastards!\n\nThey sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey're going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou bunch of beasts,\n\nMutt,\n\nSon of a bitch!!!!!\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was the most frantic and the most crazed.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no room for maneuver!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he was truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty years old, he was not married, he had no children, he still had a life to live, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap was delivered.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get back.\" The girl's mother reprimanded.\n\nZhou Ze was desperate,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nNo matter how much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on a conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of it, he was incredibly terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being upset,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nAnd then going home to have dinner and continue tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed that he had been pushed into a narrow space filled with the smell of oil residue.\n\nThen,\n\nSticky liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nThen,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nA raging fire,\n\nFire everywhere...",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

    "content": "午夜的街頭，\n\n\n\n  路燈黃黃，\n\n\n\n  人也惶惶，\n\n\n\n  天很冷，還有風，似刀子割人。\n\n\n\n  周澤也感到冷，\n\n\n\n  他不知道這裡又是哪裡，\n\n\n\n  但知道一件事，\n\n\n\n  這裡是……人間。\n\n\n\n  他已經死了，但又回來了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道自己該怎麼辦，\n\n\n\n  只能機械麻木地繼續往前走。\n\n\n\n  他現在沒有功夫去思考太多其他的事情，\n\n\n\n  比如自己剛剛下去的地方，\n\n\n\n  比如那個自己車禍前救治的老者，\n\n\n\n  比如水潭裡身穿著紅色衣裙的無面女，\n\n\n\n  比如……自己的指甲。\n\n\n\n  他回來了，本該是很喜悅的一件事，但哪怕身邊偶爾有人走過，哪怕他再用力地打招呼，也依舊沒人可以看見他和聽見他。\n\n\n\n  他被這個世界給排擠了，隔絕了。\n\n\n\n  沒嘗試過被關「禁閉」的人，不會了解那種被完全隔離的痛苦，而對於周澤來說，眼下整個世界，就是他的囚籠，囚籠上還蓋上了一層黑布。 \n\n\n\n  沒人能看見他，\n\n\n\n  也沒人能和他交流，\n\n\n\n  他拿不起任何一件有實的東西，\n\n\n\n  甚至，\n\n\n\n  連風都能夠從他身上輕而易舉地吹過去。\n\n\n\n  他是那麼的羸弱，\n\n\n\n  弱不禁風這個詞在他身上，真的是一點都不誇張。\n\n\n\n  而且，最讓周澤震驚和駭然的是，\n\n\n\n  他能看見自己身上不斷有淡淡的光點流散出去，\n\n\n\n  換言之，\n\n\n\n  他的身體正在慢慢地變淡。\n\n\n\n  可能再過個一刻鐘，自己就將徹底地消失不見，被抹去最後一絲微不足道的痕跡。\n\n\n\n  他不知道這一切到底是怎麼發生的，但他清楚，自己的時間，真的沒剩下多少了。\n\n\n\n  八仙里，鐵拐李就是以魂魄的方式進入了一位餓死倒地的人體內，才成了後世流傳那種形象。\n\n\n\n  周澤也聽說過關於鬼魂「借屍還魂」的故事，他也想去借屍還魂，他很冷，也很慌張，他需要一具肉體給自己去依附。\n\n\n\n  甚至，他不介意這個人是誰。\n\n\n\n  人在這個時候，總是自私的，周澤也不例外，而且，他是真的快受不了了。 \n\n\n\n  但是，每當他準備靠近一個人時，那個人的頭頂和雙肩位置都會出現光火，直接讓其無法靠近，甚至自己還因此受到了傷害，加劇了自己「揮發」的速度。\n\n\n\n  他有些累了，也有些麻木了，\n\n\n\n  他在等待自己的終結，\n\n\n\n  等待自己的結束。\n\n\n\n  作為一名已經死過一次的人，你讓他再面臨一次死亡，反而能夠變得更坦然了一些。\n\n\n\n  而且，以周澤現在的情況，繼續逗留在這裡，逗留得時間越久，也就是意味著他承受折磨的時間越長。\n\n\n\n  「吱呀……」\n\n\n\n  前面，有一家還亮著燈的店面，好像是一家書店，因為隔著店門玻璃可以看見裡面的一排排書架。\n\n\n\n  有人從裡面將門推開走了出來，是一名穿著衛衣的男子，男子戴著帽子，看不清楚真容，左顧右盼了一會兒，急匆匆離開了。\n\n\n\n  當然，男子是看不見距離他不到五米處所站著的周澤的。\n\n\n\n  原本，周澤沒覺得有什麼異常，但就在男子離開不久之後，周澤忽然自書店裡，感知到了一種溫暖的氣息。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  溫暖的氣息。\n\n\n\n  這種溫暖，讓周澤有些莫名其妙，但他眼下就像是一個即將凍死的人忽然得到一盒火柴一樣，哪怕知道火柴救不了自己的命但還是會劃開它讓自己在臨死前感知到最後的溫熱。 \n\n\n\n  周澤向那邊走過去，他的身體直接穿過了書店的玻璃門，繼續往裡走，來到了書店的書架後面。\n\n\n\n  書架後面，\n\n\n\n  躺著一個人，\n\n\n\n  是一個面容俊秀的年輕男子，年紀可能也就二十三四歲的樣子，因為店裡開著空調，所以他身上穿的衣服不多，也就一件長袖外加一件薄外套。\n\n\n\n  他躺在地上，但在他身上，周澤感知到了一種溫暖的感覺，就像是一個窮鬼，晚上走在路上撿了一袋子金幣。\n\n\n\n  這種吸引力，無法拒絕，而且現在的周澤，也沒資格去拒絕！\n\n\n\n  周澤走了過去，在這個年輕男子面前蹲了下來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道該如何去進入對方的身體，但他明白該如何去接觸自己所需要的溫暖。\n\n\n\n  一隻手伸出，放在對方的胸口位置，\n\n\n\n  周澤看見自己的指甲居然慢慢地嵌入到了對方的體內，\n\n\n\n  這是一種很詭異的感覺，不同於自己之前走在路上時「微風」吹過自己的身體，這是一種相融，以自己的指甲為媒介進行的一種融合。\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，周澤整個人開始進入到對方的體內，二者，開始了重合。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  「徐樂！你給我醒醒，醒醒！」 \n\n\n\n  周澤被一番推搡給吵醒，不，確切的說，是被「驚動」，他睜開眼，發現自己正坐在書店櫃檯後面，之前自己是雙手枕在上面。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你醒醒！」\n\n\n\n  女人的聲音很尖銳，很高亢，帶著一種頤氣指使。\n\n\n\n  抬起頭，周澤看著面前的女人，不，確切地說，應該是女孩兒，也就是高中生的年紀吧，雖然是大女孩兒了，卻還是有點稚氣未脫。\n\n\n\n  「喂，徐樂，你到底是什麼意思，你能耐了是吧，想給我爸媽給我姐臉色看了是吧，昨晚居然敢一宿沒回家！\n\n\n\n  誰給你的這個膽子！」\n\n\n\n  徐樂？\n\n\n\n  是誰？\n\n\n\n  周澤有些茫然地攤開手，發現自己雙手很平滑，自己以前的手可是因為長時間練習手術器械已經有了一些老繭，這雙手卻沒有。\n\n\n\n  「喂，我在和你說話呢！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒一巴掌拍在櫃檯上，氣勢洶洶。\n\n\n\n  周澤微微皺眉，站起身，走到了店門邊的玻璃鏡子前，他看見了自己的倒影，是一張陌生的臉，不，這張臉自己見過，是昨晚自己看見的那張臉。\n\n\n\n  這身體，\n\n\n\n  是我的了？\n\n\n\n  「喂，你什麼意思啊，我爸媽可都生氣了，我媽還在家裡發脾氣了呢，我告訴你啊，你現在吃的喝的用的都是我家的，你這個上門女婿有什麼資格在我家裡擺譜？ \n\n\n\n  你想做樣子給誰看啊！\n\n\n\n  你今晚再敢不回家，信不信我過來直接抽你！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒作勢揚起自己的巴掌，但她忽然發現自己面前的男子也就是自己的「姐夫」沒有像是往常一樣躲閃和求饒，反而那一雙眸子裡的意味，讓她感到有些害怕。\n\n\n\n  這時候，她看了看時間，發現已經七點半了。\n\n\n\n  「哼，我先上學去了，晚上再和你算帳！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒氣呼呼地走了。\n\n\n\n  周澤則是緩緩地坐回到了自己櫃檯後面的椅子上，這裡有一台老式筆記本，筆記本旁邊還有一部手機。\n\n\n\n  即使是現在，他依舊沒能從自己身份轉換的過程中適應過來。\n\n\n\n  他是周澤，是通城有名的年輕外科醫生，而且，他是一個孤兒，\n\n\n\n  結果，\n\n\n\n  自己眼下變成這個身份，\n\n\n\n  剛剛那個女孩兒說什麼來著？\n\n\n\n  我是……上門女婿？\n\n\n\n  有一個妻子？\n\n\n\n  還有丈母娘和丈人？\n\n\n\n  而且看自己這個小姨子剛剛自己這個「姐夫」面前說話的態度和語氣，自己這個「上門女婿」還真是符合古代的優良傳統。 \n\n\n\n  上門女婿，俗稱倒插門的，不光被妻子家裡人看不起，在古代也會被周遭所有人看不起，甚至身份和罪犯差不多，漢唐的時候那些被強迫戍邊的人裡面往往也有贅婿。\n\n\n\n  拿起手機，手機沒設置密碼，也不知道是那貨懶還是不敢設密碼，至少在這個時候讓周澤很輕鬆地打開了他的微信和QQ。\n\n\n\n  QQ列表里人很少，也就是些許初中同學，高中同學和大學同學，然後有一個家人的列表，裡面只有一個人，備註是「老婆」。\n\n\n\n  打開了和她的QQ聊天記錄，空。\n\n\n\n  好吧，\n\n\n\n  周澤打開了微信，試著找了一下，找到了備註是「老婆」的女人，這裡有回覆了，基本都是徐樂問一些事情，比如今晚吃什麼，今晚要準備做什麼，進貨需要花多少錢，最近書店賣了多少錢，你身體怎麼樣一大堆，\n\n\n\n  然後對方的回覆往往很敷衍也很高冷，\n\n\n\n  以：\n\n\n\n  「哦」\n\n\n\n  「嗯」\n\n\n\n  「好」\n\n\n\n  來代替。\n\n\n\n  周澤將手機丟一邊，這個人際關係，有點複雜了，他忽然看了一下自己的手掌，自己的指甲和常人沒什麼區別。\n\n\n\n  但自己出車禍前救治的那個老者，自己從無面女人手中脫困，自己進入這個傢伙身體等這些事情上，自己的指甲，起到了極為關鍵的作用。 \n\n\n\n  心隨意動，\n\n\n\n  就在這個時候，\n\n\n\n  周澤發現自己的指甲開始慢慢地變長，同時也變得漆黑通透起來，甚至在指甲上，還有淡淡的黑霧繚繞。\n\n\n\n  「呼…………」\n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  再睜開眼時，\n\n\n\n  指甲又恢復了正常。\n\n\n\n  一直從早上到中午，周澤都坐在那裡嘗試去適應自己的這個新身份，也在平復自己身份轉換所帶來的不適應感，中午飯都沒吃，也不知道是忘記了還是自己根本就不覺得餓。\n\n\n\n  這裡依舊還是通城，周澤以前的家在崇川區，現在則是在港閘區，距離並不遠。\n\n\n\n  到了下午時，周澤才嘆了口氣，默默地站起身，既來之則安之吧。\n\n\n\n  他開始試著打掃書架，總歸，給自己先找點事情做做。\n\n\n\n  那個死前掐過自己的老者曾說過「他被發現了」以及地獄裡無面女說過的「你遲早會被抓住」，讓周澤心裡產生了些許危機感。\n\n\n\n  他現在的狀態，算是「苟活」了，死而復生，是邀天之倖，所以他很珍惜，至少，在沒完全分清楚狀況和掌握足夠線索前，自己得代入這個身份，最好不要引起太大的異常，不要引起那些「要抓他的人」的注意。 \n\n\n\n  這家店的生意，真的很不好，傳統圖書市場的低迷，早就不是一天兩天的事兒了，而且這裡又不是在學校的大門口黃金一條街上。\n\n\n\n  只能說，那個「徐樂」選擇在這裡開一家書店，能不能保本都是一個問題。\n\n\n\n  一直到下午三點鐘的時候，才走進來今天的第一位客人。\n\n\n\n  客人在小學生讀物那邊轉悠著，且轉悠了很長時間。\n\n\n\n  周澤等了一會兒，還是走過去，問道：「選什麼題材的？」\n\n\n\n  雖然，周澤也不懂。\n\n\n\n  「隨便看看。」對方回答道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」周澤也就不再理會了，他現在還沒融入這個「書店老闆」的角色里。\n\n\n\n  但就在這時，\n\n\n\n  對方卻忽然走到了自己身後，幽幽地開口道：\n\n\n\n  「你真的不認識我了？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「昨晚我用棒球棒打了你的頭，搶了你的錢，\n\n\n\n  而且我還特意去試了一下，\n\n\n\n  你那時分明已經沒有鼻息了的。」",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned. So, the reason he was able to possess the body of \"Xu Le\" last night through a borrowed corpse to return the soul was because Xu Le had just been killed?\n\nBecause his body was still warm, he could enter it?\n\nLooking at it this way, he seemed to be quite lucky.\n\nWithout any aversion, anger, or panic about his identity being exposed, Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the man behind him, who was about the same age as him.\n\nThe man was stunned.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy,\n\nIt was relief,\n\nEven,\n\nThere was a hint of admiration.\n\nAs a host, Zhou Ze knew how difficult the situation was last night. If this guy hadn't happened to commit murder at that time, he might have been scattered into ashes and wouldn't have seen today's sun.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night, and my head felt very uncomfortable this morning, like I'd had too much to drink. I forgot what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the other party would guess that he was a ghost possessing a body, unless the guy was out of his mind.\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The other party pointed to his nose, finding it somewhat ridiculous. \"Even though I already told you that I hit you hard yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's okay, I should thank you for not taking my phone and computer from my desk.\"\n\n\"That… I forgot,\" the man scratched his head. \"I'm glad you're okay. This is the money I stole from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then fumbled for a bit more and took out eight hundred yuan.\n\n\"Eight hundred yuan is for your medical expenses, and three hundred is what I stole yesterday,\" the man pursed his lips. \"I lost my salary gambling online yesterday and lost it all to the bookie. When I passed by your bookstore, I suddenly wanted some money. After I knocked you down, I found you had no breath and was scared to death.\n\nI ran home and didn't sleep all night, wondering if the police would suddenly break in and arrest me for robbery and murder. I only took three hundred yuan, and I feel so stupid, so not worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\n\"Buddy, I'm so glad you're not dead. Really, I've been hanging around outside since this morning. I was waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for the police to come, but then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\nDo you know, at that time, I was almost kneeling on the ground to kowtow to you. Thank you, you're tough, you didn't die, otherwise, I would be finished. There are so many surveillance cameras here, if you had died, I definitely wouldn't have been able to escape.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand and then at the \"murderer\" who was repenting with tears in his eyes. He felt that the scene was very strange.\n\nTo be honest, \"Xu Le\" was dead. Because he died, Zhou Ze could take over his body. And because Zhou Ze took over his body, this guy in front of him was spared the charge of murder.\n\nBoth he and the guy in front of him benefited, only that unfortunate Xu Le suffered.\n\n\"Okay, it's nothing. Maybe I just had a blocked airway last night.\" Zhou Ze moved the other man's hand off his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor and had seen all sorts of filth. But in that extreme environment, he had developed a bit of潔癖 (germophobia). In fact, most emergency doctors have mild to severe germophobia.\n\nIt was precisely because he had seen too much dirt and filth that he cherished \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" The man asked with some surprise.\n\n\"No, I don't blame you,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"You should go back to work and live your life. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy, you're a good person.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily and left the bookstore to embrace his \"new life.\"\n\nAs for Zhou Ze, he picked up his phone. After thinking about it, he felt he still had to call the police. Not to report the murder of himself (Xu Le), but to report the other party for suspected theft.\n\nLet the police investigate. If the other party really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and was caught by the police, then it would be his own fault.\n\nSince he had taken over someone else's body, he had to do something for this unfortunate soul.\n\nAlthough, given the other party's good attitude in admitting his mistake and returning his medical expenses, it was indeed quite unethical and unfilial to still report him by name.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the voice from the other end of the line just came through,\n\nAt the entrance of the store,\n\nThe guy suddenly returned.\n\n\"There's one more thing…\" As soon as the other person walked in, he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He was stunned and pointed directly at Zhou Ze, \"You're still going to call the police, aren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Show me your phone, give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You broke your promise, you scoundrel, I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly became agitated and excited. He probably had some mental issues, perhaps due to the rhythm of his gambling life and social isolation. He tended to become extreme when stimulated by something.\n\nThe other party lunged over, and Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to retreat.\n\nHe was a doctor in his previous life, not a boxer, nor did he practice martial arts. His body in this life was also a bit weak. When it came to fighting face-to-face, he was indeed a little flustered.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man hit Zhou Ze and pinned him against the wall, while his hands began to choke Zhou Ze's neck tightly.\n\n\"I'll let you call the police, I'll let you call the police, I'll let you break your promise, fine, I'll let you die, let you really die, this time I'll strangle you to death and then let you bleed, let's see if you die!\"\n\nThe man roared through gritted teeth.\n\nUnfortunately, the bookstore was deserted in the afternoon. Not to mention customers, there were not even many pedestrians at the entrance.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he could no longer breathe. Zhou Ze tried his best to struggle. During the struggle, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and grew longer.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his arms around the man's back.\n\n\"Hiss…\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, rolled his eyes, and let go of Zhou Ze's neck. He stumbled back a few steps, knocked over a few bookshelves, and then collapsed to the ground with a thud.\n\nZhou Ze escaped. He reached out and rubbed his neck. He wasn't too panicked before. After all, his fingernails could even injure the evil spirits in hell. It should be no problem to deal with an ordinary person, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze hadn't fully understood the specific reason or use of these fingernails. He only knew that they were \"infected\" by the old man he had treated before his car accident.\n\nIt's really true,\n\nIf you get nail fungus, it infects two.\n\nHe walked over, squatted down, and Zhou Ze reached out and patted the man's face. Fortunately, he wasn't dead, and he was still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n………………\n\nAfter finishing the statement at the police station, the police officer asked Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall. Because the matter Zhou Ze reported was a bit strange, saying that the robber who came to rob him but was knocked unconscious was the \"murderer,\" and the current murderer was in the hospital and would have to wait until he woke up for further confirmation.\n\nHowever, at least the police officers didn't handcuff Zhou Ze.\n\nA middle-aged man was squatting next to Zhou Ze, his left hand chained to a radiator.\n\n\"Brother, you're awesome. That guy was going to rob you and you took him down?\" The middle-aged man with a somewhat disheveled face rubbed his muddy bangs. \"You really have that spirit of my youth. You have to beat those blind thieves to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you behave yourself,\" a young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. \"How many times have you stolen electric bike batteries this winter?\n\nI say, it's almost the New Year, can't you be quiet? Or find a job and earn some money honestly to send home? You're so old already.\"\n\n\"It's impossible to work, it's impossible to work in this lifetime. I don't know how to do business. Only by stealing electric bike batteries can I make a living. Going to the detention center feels like going home.\n\nEveryone in there is a talent, they talk nicely, I really like it in there!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to bother with this guy anymore and turned to leave.\n\n\"Brother, how was my speech just now?\" The greasy middle-aged man gave Zhou Ze a flirtatious glance.\n\n\"Very interesting,\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol, Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Let me tell you, this life should be…\" The greasy middle-aged man paused, then looked towards the door and said, \"Oh my god, she's so beautiful. Is that a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked over. At the door, a woman in a blue down jacket and long leather boots, along with another female police officer, were walking towards them.\n\n\"Should be a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, the aura she exuded was the most attractive.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a police uniform,\" the greasy man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe she's undercover,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right, beautiful police flower, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in more often from now on,\" the greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, looking unsatisfied. \"If I could marry her, I'd be willing to lose ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He didn't dare to joke about lifespan and longevity anymore.\n\n\"You don't agree?\" The greasy man saw Zhou Ze shake his head and said anxiously, \"You're blind, you know? A woman like this, trading ten years of your life for her, is definitely not a loss…\"\n\nAt this moment, the female police officer and the woman in the long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to pick you up. The investigation over there is clear, and you're okay,\" the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"…………\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"…………\" The greasy middle-aged man.",

    "content": "Comrade police officer, may I ask, what is my wife's name again?\n\n\n\nThis thought only crossed his mind for a moment; Zhou Ze wasn't foolish enough to actually ask. However, he genuinely didn't know his \"wife's\" real name. In this era, very few people used their real names for their QQ or WeChat IDs.\n\n\n\nThe greasy man, however, cast a resentful glance at Zhou Ze: Brother, you're not being fair. We agreed to be broken-winged angels together, didn't we?\n\n\n\nZhou Ze gave a helpless glance back: I'm also very surprised.\n\n\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and muttered softly, \"My dumplings are delicious.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\n\n\nHis \"wife\" said in a cold tone, then turned and walked directly outside.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow.\n\n\n\nShe was driving a Cayenne and got into the car directly.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.\n\n\n\nTo be honest,\n\n\n\nIt was a bit awkward.\n\n\n\nIf that unlucky guy Xu Le's marital and family life had been more normal, he wouldn't be in such an awkward situation now. He could have found excuses to explain his wife's concern, like feeling dizzy and forgetting things;\n\n\n\nBut this woman clearly exuded the demeanor of an ice queen, seemingly indifferent to him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like a routine formality.\n\n\n\n\"My dog ran away, was found by the security guard, and I'm going to pick him up.\"\n\n\n\nIt felt like that.\n\n\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as himself (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nAs the car drove onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nSilence resumed.\n\n\n\nThe woman felt her husband was being unusually quiet today, but she had no intention of probing the reason.\n\n\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She pressed the speakerphone, and a voice came from the car's audio system:\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's just been a school bus collision accident on Qingnian Middle Road. We're already receiving injured patients at our hospital. The director wants you to come back immediately.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was slightly stunned.\n\n\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor.\n\n\n\nAnd,\n\n\n\nHis wife's surname was \"Lin.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know, I'll be right back.\" The woman hung up the phone, exited the elevated highway directly, made a sharp turn at the traffic light, and drove towards the hospital.\n\n\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi. Instead, she drove straight into the Chongchuan District People's Hospital parking lot.\n\n\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze was actually worried she would ask him to get out and take a taxi home, thinking he would have to shamelessly ask:\n\n\n\n\"Wife, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\n\n\nHe thought it was ridiculous.\n\n\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and took the elevator. Zhou Ze also got into the elevator. The woman went into the women's locker room, and Zhou Ze…\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench in the corridor.\n\n\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived. One was severely injured, and five children were also not lightly injured.\n\n\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and busily treating patients,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench and stare blankly.\n\n\n\nIt felt a bit like a mother bringing her son to work; the mother works while the son watches and plays nearby.\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\n\n\nThe hospital's characteristic smell of disinfectant and the stuffiness of the central air conditioning were truly nostalgic, a familiar feeling.\n\n\n\nThe emergency room was ahead. The severely injured and critically ill patient seemed to be a little girl.\n\n\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus that had been involved in the accident. Seeing the children crying out in pain on the operating table was indeed heartbreaking.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. At this time in the past, he would have already changed and participated in the treatment. He was the most famous young surgeon in Tongcheng. Now, he could only be an observer.\n\n\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable, but he had to endure it. Moreover, this People's Hospital was considered the best hospital in Tongcheng, and its number and quality of doctors were unquestionable. They should be able to handle it.\n\n\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. They had minor injuries and only needed their wounds treated or simple bandaging.\n\n\n\nTraffic police were stationed at the entrance of the floor. Some parents who had been notified had arrived and were very emotional. However, letting parents in at this time might affect the treatment process, so they had to be stopped for now.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the window at the far end of the corridor, raised the window frame, and took out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, so it was convenient at this moment.\n\n\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital.\"\n\n\n\nJust as he put the cigarette butt in his mouth, a clear little girl's voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily-patterned dress standing behind him, pouting and looking at him indignantly.\n\n\n\nCough, cough,\n\n\n\nThis was a bit awkward.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze could only put away his cigarette. Regardless, being lectured by a little girl about public morality felt somewhat embarrassing.\n\n\n\n\"Little friend, aren't you cold wearing so little?\" Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\n\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a slightly chubby face with baby fat, and big eyes. She was very cute, like a life-sized Barbie doll.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" the little girl shook her head. \"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital anymore.\"\n\n\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze nodded earnestly.\n\n\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\n\n\"I'm fine. Other children are injured, and they are in a lot of pain.\"\n\n\n\nThe little girl turned sideways and looked at the children whose wounds were being bandaged behind her. Most of them were crying. It wasn't necessarily because of unbearable pain, but rather that if one child cried, the others would follow.\n\n\n\nThe nurses were treating the wounds while also comforting the children.\n\n\n\nThe parents, who were temporarily blocked by the traffic police outside, were making noise and cursing outside.\n\n\n\nIn short,\n\n\n\nThis floor felt chaotic.\n\n\n\n\"Then you're really lucky,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\n\nThe little girl didn't have a single scratch on her.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, I was sitting in the last row, so I'm okay,\" the little girl nodded, then actively ran over to comfort her classmates, looking here and there, encouraging and comforting them.\n\n\n\nA sensible and strong child.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze turned around and instinctively took out his cigarette again, but then put it back.\n\n\n\nAs he walked back to sit on the bench, three nurses and two doctors emerged from the emergency room.\n\n\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor; the female doctor was his wife.\n\n\n\n\"It's okay, we did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to put a hand on Zhou Ze's wife's shoulder to comfort her.\n\n\n\nAs her husband,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\n\n\nBut he didn't feel annoyed by this scene…\n\n\n\nThe detestable Xu Le had left him such a complicated mess, being a live-in son-in-law, with a very ill-tempered sister-in-law and a clearly temperamental mother-in-law and father-in-law.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would quickly have an affair, leave him, and divorce him so he could be alone in peace.\n\n\n\nWho, after being resurrected into a new body, would want to bother with the complexities of modern urban life as a son-in-law?\n\n\n\nHowever, what surprised Zhou Ze was that his wife directly pushed away the doctor's outstretched hand and pointed at him, saying:\n\n\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\n\n\nHer tone lacked any warmth or affection. It was simple, stiff, like saying, \"This is the husky we keep at home.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir,\" the male doctor said, looking a bit awkward. After all, flirting with someone's wife in front of them always felt a little unconfident.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze smiled and greeted him. It seemed his wife was very virtuous… but he couldn't feel happy. It wasn't due to any cuckoldry complex;\n\n\n\nIt was simply that life would be so much better if it were simpler.\n\n\n\n\"I'll go take a look over there. The other children have been treated, and they should be fine. You should go back and rest with your husband early,\" the male doctor said and then left.\n\n\n\nDr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves and threw them on the ground.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and she was biting her lip with her teeth. Clearly, she was in a bad mood, which meant that the severely injured child couldn't be saved.\n\n\n\nThis look was very \"pitiful.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze began to understand Xu Le a little. This live-in son-in-law earned considerably more than his peers. His in-laws' family conditions were better than his own, and this Dr. Lin was indeed very beautiful.\n\n\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience more in the future. Just seek peace of mind,\"\n\n\n\nAs someone with more experience, Zhou Ze comforted her from the side. His experience was much richer than his \"wife's,\" so his emotional resilience was naturally stronger.\n\n\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n\n\nThe woman replied with those two words. If Zhou Ze, in his original capacity as an elder, had said this, it would have been genuine advice;\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le. With his appearance, saying this to Dr. Lin was purely speaking from a position of privilege and insensitivity.\n\n\n\n\"…………\" Zhou Ze shrugged and inwardly scorned that Xu Le again. Look how timid you are; your wife dares to tell you to shut up directly in public.\n\n\n\nDr. Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up: \"I'm going to change. Let's go home.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, two nurses pulled open the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white cloth.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze glanced at it. He had seen many deceased patients. In his years of practicing medicine, he had saved many lives, but he had also seen many patients die helplessly before his eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Lin, is this your husband?\" a young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but unlike other female doctors' or nurses' boyfriends, Dr. Lin's husband had never appeared at the hospital.\n\n\n\nYou can't blame them for joking even when facing death. It's like asking someone who goes to Tibet once and posts on WeChat saying their soul has been purified, is moved, and is pious, to stay there for ten years and expect them to endure it the same way; it's unrealistic.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin nodded. At this time, her emotions had calmed down a bit.\n\n\n\n\"Then you two should hurry back. Maybe you have something planned when you get back, right?\n\n\n\nI'm telling you, our Dr. Lin loves children very much. You should hurry home…\"\n\n\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\n\n\n\"…………\" The little nurse.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw the edge of the lily-patterned dress peeking out from under the white cloth. His mind went \"boom,\" and he suddenly realized that the little girl he had just seen, who was completely unharmed,\n\n\n\nShe wasn't human!",
