    "content": "Cupping a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly lifted his head, looking at his reflection in the mirror. He looked a bit haggard, a standard look for an emergency room doctor.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. Looks like they fell from upstairs, not sure if it was a suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called out from the men's restroom doorway.\n\n\"Got it, be right there,\" Zhou Ze replied, then pulled out a tissue to wipe off the water droplets and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly pulled into the hospital. On the stretcher lay an elderly man in a gray Tang suit. The old man was coughing incessantly, occasionally expelling bloody froth and fragments of internal organs, his entire body covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition, and at the same time shouted to those ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these kinds of things at this moment. After all, those who can calmly face death are few. And as a doctor, this is certainly not the time to analyze the illness with the patient or tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... it's really too terrifying down there...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Steady your emotions, relax. Your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist was throbbing with pain, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down again... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were long, and for some unknown reason, they were black—a translucent black, like amber, not appearing to have dirt accumulated within.\n\nAnd at this moment, the old man's fingernails had already dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat up straight and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, the hand gripping Zhou Ze's released, and he became motionless.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitative measures, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me take care of your wound,\" Wang Ya came over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't particularly worried about this minor skin injury. What they were most concerned about was the possibility of the old man having other diseases, which could put the doctor in a dangerous situation of occupational exposure. After all, the old man had a lot of blood on his hands, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant that the person couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone was a bit disappointed, but for them, this kind of thing was already commonplace, and they would quickly adjust.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, get a check-up,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and drove away.\n\nAs soon as the car drove under the elevated Jianghai Avenue, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now, please ask the children to wait a little longer for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other side quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze checked the time again, it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze pressed the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"Honk!!!!!\"\n\nAnd at that very moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran the red light and came crashing over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look at the blinding high beams outside the car window,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly flung away by the heavy truck, tumbling several times in the air before crashing onto the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up.\n\nHe found that his body was completely unable to move, as if it were stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he really wanted to check his injuries now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he occasionally heard the sounds of other vehicles passing by, and various horn sounds.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car came, and the sound of a fire truck,\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance reached Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nZhou Ze felt his body being moved. The surrounding temperature was slightly high, indicating that his car was being cut open to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his trunk and the Children's Day party for the orphanage kids would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered a sudden misfortune, after all.\n\nThere were also the voices of a few nurses nearby. Because the surroundings were too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, Dr. Chen's next words sent Zhou Ze's heart plummeting into a chasm!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze shouted desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt those heavy compressions, but he couldn't open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe wanted them to quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying of a few nurses he recognized,\n\nDr. Chen punched the nearby car door, looking incredibly grief-stricken.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nPlease don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI should be in a state of suspended animation right now,\n\nToo much blood loss?\n\nSeriously injured?\n\nBut I really am not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared madly in his heart.\n\nBut next, he felt himself being lifted onto a stretcher, likely being taken into an ambulance.\n\nThen came the sound of the ambulance starting to move.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded particularly harsh in Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy were they crying!\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the hospital director speaking:\n\n\"Little Zhou is just gone, just like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very serious. Doctor Zhou was excessively injured, lost too much blood, and has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone?\" Another vice-director still didn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, these people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his superiors or elders.\n\nThey actually determined that he was dead,\n\nBut can a dead person still hear and perceive things?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nYou mongrels,\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move, and the surroundings were quiet, with the temperature gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it, someone just gone like that. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"There's no telling what fortune or misfortune the future holds, just try to look on the bright side.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAround,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze struggled incessantly, trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like sleep paralysis; no matter how hard he tried, his body simply wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair,\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted,\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and a sharp stinging sensation was also clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" Someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, just a moment. He was hit so hard, how can the makeup be done so quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital is urging us, they need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Then you do it.\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people, so dead people naturally wouldn't feel pain, and there was no need to worry about complaints. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze had no strength left to struggle,\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush pressing down on his face,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. We're done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed into clothes. Immediately after, he was pushed out, and the hospital orderlies carried him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be a cold storage casket.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly isolated,\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The cold storage casket lid must have been opened.\n\nWhat entered his ears,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe director was speaking into a microphone, praising him, lamenting his loss,\n\nThen came the vice-director and the department head, and so on.\n\nAround,\n\nFootsteps occasionally passed by,\n\nSome people just walked by quietly, taking a final look,\n\nSome even tried to call out his name a few times, with a choked voice,\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI really am not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe began to try again,\n\nBut still couldn't,\n\nHe could only hear, and feel,\n\nBut couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes,\n\nEveryone thought he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying around him.\n\nThey cried sincerely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who grew up in an orphanage. As a result, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage that evening to celebrate Children's Day with the kids.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation to the orphanage, don't worry.\" The vice-director said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being isolated again; the lid of the cold storage casket must have been closed again.\n\nThen came another series of bumps,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the cold storage casket was opened again,\n\nThe surroundings were a bit quiet, with occasional human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one grasping his shoulders and one his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which felt like a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, there were faint, indistinct sounds of crying.\n\nZhou Ze initially couldn't figure out where he was again,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood,\n\nBastards!\n\nThey had sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou beasts,\n\nYou mongrels!\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis was Zhou Ze's most frantic moment, and his most insane,\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he truly was unwilling. He was not yet thirty years old, he had not yet started a family, he had no children, he still had a life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw this uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice sounded from nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small smack to the mouth.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was incredibly afraid!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for feeling sad,\n\nOnly responsible for feeling grief,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing on tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being pushed into a narrow place full of the smell of oil residue,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA sticky liquid sprayed onto him,\n\nHe knew what this was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nExtremely hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nGreat fire,\n\nFire everywhere..."

    "content": "Midnight streets,\n\nThe streetlights cast a yellow glow,\n\nPeople wandered in a daze,\n\nThe weather was bitterly cold, with a wind that cut like knives.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\n\nHe didn't know where this was again,\n\nBut he knew one thing,\n\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe had already died, but he had returned.\n\nHe didn't know what he should do,\n\nHe could only mechanically and numbly continue to walk forward.\n\nHe didn't have the time to think about too many other things right now,\n\nLike the place he had just descended to,\n\nLike the old man he had saved before his car accident,\n\nLike the faceless woman in the pond wearing a red dress,\n\nLike... his own fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyous occasion, but even when someone occasionally walked by, no matter how hard he tried to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe was ostracized, isolated by this world.\n\nThose who hadn't experienced \"solitary confinement\" wouldn't understand the pain of complete isolation. For Zhou Ze, the entire world right now was his prison, and a black cloth had been draped over it.\n\nNo one could see him,\n\nNo one could communicate with him,\n\nHe couldn't pick up any solid object,\n\nEven,\n\nThe wind could easily blow right through him.\n\nHe was so frail,\n\nThe term \"weak as a willow in the wind\" was no exaggeration when applied to him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that,\n\nHe could see faint specks of light constantly dissipating from his body,\n\nIn other words,\n\nHis body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would completely disappear, every last insignificant trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this had happened, but he knew that he really didn't have much time left.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Tie Guai Li entered the body of a starving, collapsed man as a spirit, which is how he became the figure passed down through generations.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"possessing a body to return to life.\" He wanted to possess a body to return to life. He was very cold and very panicked. He needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nHe didn't even care who that person was.\n\nAt times like these, people are always selfish, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nBut every time he tried to approach someone, lights would appear above their heads and shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even got hurt as a result, accelerating his \"evaporation\" rate.\n\nHe was a little tired, a little numb,\n\nHe was waiting for his end,\n\nWaiting for his demise.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him a little more at ease.\n\nMoreover, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would endure torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a storefront still lit up, appearing to be a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\n\nSomeone pushed the door open and walked out; it was a man in a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his face wasn't clear. He looked left and right for a moment, then hurried away.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze hadn't noticed anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\n\nYes,\n\nA warm aura.\n\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel somewhat inexplicable, but he was like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly found a box of matches. Even though he knew the matches wouldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last bit of warmth before he died.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it. His body passed directly through the bookstore's glass door, continued inward, and arrived behind the bookstore's bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\n\nLay a person,\n\nIt was a young man with a handsome face, perhaps only twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on inside the store, he wasn't wearing much clothing, just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\n\nHe lay on the ground, but Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling on him, like a pauper walking down the road at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\n\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, at this moment, had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of the young man.\n\nHe didn't know how to enter the other's body, but he knew how to access the warmth he needed.\n\nHe extended a hand and placed it on the other's chest.\n\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embedding into the other's body.\n\nThis was a very strange feeling, different from the \"breeze\" blowing through his body when he was walking on the road earlier. This was a fusion, a blending using his fingernails as a medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other's body. The two began to overlap.\n\n...............\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was awakened, or more accurately, \"startled,\" by a series of shoves. He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, where his hands had previously been resting.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, carrying an air of condescension.\n\nRaising his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, more accurately, she was a girl, likely high school age. Although she was a big girl, she still had a touch of childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what exactly do you mean? You've gotten quite bold, haven't you? You want to disrespect my parents and my sister, do you? How dare you not come home all night last night!\n\nWho gave you the guts?!\"\n\nXu Le?\n\nWho is that?\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion, finding them smooth. His own hands used to have calluses from long hours of practicing surgical procedures, but these hands did not.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slapped the counter with a furious air.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the door. He saw his reflection: an unfamiliar face. No, he had seen this face before, it was the face he saw last night.\n\nThis body,\n\nIs mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are really angry. My mom is throwing a fit at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now comes from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\n\nWho are you trying to impress?!\n\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe it or not, I'll come over and smack you!\"\n\nThe girl made a motion to raise her palm, but she suddenly noticed that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" wasn't dodging or begging as he usually would. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\n\nAt this point, she checked the time and saw it was already seven-thirty.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm off to school. I'll settle accounts with you tonight!\"\n\nThe girl stomped off in a huff.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a mobile phone next to it.\n\nEven now, he hadn't fully adapted to his change in identity.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\n\nAs a result,\n\nHe had now become this identity.\n\nWhat did that girl just say?\n\nI'm a... live-in son-in-law?\n\nHave a wife?\n\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" towards her \"brother-in-law\" just now, his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient traditions.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-to-door son-in-law,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even similar to that of criminals, and during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced to serve in border garrisons often included live-in sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up the phone. It had no password, perhaps because the guy was lazy or didn't dare to set one. At least for Zhou Ze, it made it easy to open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThe QQ list was short, just a few middle school, high school, and college classmates, and then a family list with only one person, labeled \"Wife.\"\n\nHe opened his QQ chat history with her; it was empty.\n\nAlright,\n\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to find the woman labeled \"Wife.\" There were replies here, mostly Xu Le asking about things like what to eat tonight, what needed to be done tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how his health was, and a whole bunch of other things.\n\nThe other party's replies were often perfunctory and cold,\n\nSuch as:\n\n\"Oh\"\n\n\"Mm\"\n\n\"Okay\"\n\nTo replace longer sentences.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This interpersonal relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm. His fingernails were no different from a normal person's.\n\nBut in the events leading up to his car accident, when he saved the old man, when he escaped from the faceless woman, and when he entered this guy's body, his fingernails played a crucial role.\n\nWith a thought,\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly lengthening, while also becoming black and translucent. There was even a faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n\"Whew...\"\n\nHe let out a long breath,\n\nClosed his eyes,\n\nAnd when he opened them again,\n\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort caused by his identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, perhaps forgetting or simply not feeling hungry.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze finally sighed and quietly stood up. Since he was here, he would make the best of it.\n\nHe began to try cleaning the bookshelves, at least to give himself something to do.\n\nThe old man who had choked him before he died had said \"he's been found,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said \"you'll be caught sooner or later,\" which gave Zhou Ze a sense of crisis.\n\nHis current state was considered \"barely surviving.\" To die and return to life was a stroke of divine luck, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to embody this identity. It was best not to cause too much abnormality, and not to attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThis shop's business was truly bad. The slump in the traditional book market hadn't been a one-day or two-day affair, and this location wasn't on a prime street near a school gate.\n\nOne could only say that whether \"Xu Le\" could break even by opening a bookstore here was a question mark.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\n\nThe customer lingered in the children's books section for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What kind of topic are you looking for?\"\n\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't really understand either.\n\n\"Just browsing,\" the other party replied.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze stopped bothering, as he hadn't yet fully embraced his role as \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut just then,\n\nThe other person suddenly walked behind him and said eerily,\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and stole your money,\n\nAnd I even specifically checked,\n\nYou clearly weren't breathing then.\""

    "content": "Zhou Ze froze for a moment. So, the reason he could possess Xu Le's body last night was because the man had just been killed?\n\nAnd because the body was still warm, he was able to enter it?\n\nLooking at it this way, he seemed to be quite lucky.\n\nWithout disgust, anger, or the panic of potentially being exposed, Zhou Ze turned to face the man who was about his age.\n\nThe man was startled.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy.\n\nIt was relief.\n\nAnd even,\n\nA hint of appreciation.\n\nAs a host, Zhou Ze clearly understood the difficult situation he faced last night. If this guy hadn't coincidentally killed someone at that time, he might have been annihilated, never to see the sun today.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night, and my head feels really uncomfortable this morning, like I'm drunk. I've forgotten what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze casually explained.\n\nHe didn't think the other person would guess he was a ghost possessing a body, unless the other person had water in their brain.\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The other man pointed to his nose, sounding a bit absurd. \"Even though I just told you I hit you over the head yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine. In fact, I thank you for not taking my phone and laptop from the table.\"\n\n\"Uh... I forgot,\" the man scratched his head. \"It's good that you're okay. This is the money I robbed from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then rummaged again and pulled out another eight hundred yuan.\n\n\"Eight hundred yuan is for your medical expenses, and three hundred is what I robbed yesterday,\" the man pursed his lips. \"Yesterday, I gambled away all my wages online to the bookie. When I passed your bookstore, I suddenly wanted to get some money. After I knocked you down, I found you weren't breathing, and I was scared to death.\n\nI ran home and couldn't sleep all night, thinking the police might suddenly break in and arrest me. Robbery and murder... I only took three hundred yuan, and I felt so stupid, it wasn't worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder,\n\n\"Buddy, it's really good that you're not dead. Really, I've been wandering outside since this morning. I was waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for them to come, but then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\nYou know, at that moment, I almost knelt down and kowtowed to you. Thank you. You're strong-willed, you didn't die, otherwise, I'd be finished. There are so many cameras here; if you had died, I definitely couldn't have escaped.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, and then at the \"murderer\" in front of him, who was repenting with tears in his eyes. He felt that this scene was quite bizarre.\n\nHonestly, \"Xu Le\" was dead; because he died, Zhou Ze could usurp his nest. And because Zhou Ze usurped his nest, this guy in front of him was exempt from the crime of murder.\n\nBoth Zhou Ze and this guy in front of him benefited. Only Xu Le, the unlucky fellow, was out of luck.\n\n\"Alright, it's fine. Maybe I just had a stitch yesterday,\" Zhou Ze moved the man's hand off his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor; what kind of filth hadn't he seen? But in that extreme environment, he had developed a slight潔癖. In fact, most emergency doctors have varying degrees of潔癖.\n\nIt was precisely because he had seen too much dirt and filth that he understood how to cherish \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" The man said with some joy.\n\n\"No, I don't blame you,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"You go back to work and live your life well. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy. You're a straightforward person.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily and left the bookstore, going to embrace his \"new life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he should still call the police. Not to report the other party for killing him (Xu Le), but to report them for suspected theft.\n\nAnyway, let the police investigate. If the other party really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and was caught by the police, it was what he deserved.\n\nHe had occupied someone else's body, so he had to do something for that unlucky guy.\n\nAlthough, given the other party's good attitude of admitting wrongdoing and even paying for medical expenses, his still reporting them by name was indeed quite unethical, a bit like \"having a son but no asshole.\"*\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze had dialed 110, and the voice from the operator had just come through,\n\nAt the bookstore entrance,\n\nThat guy suddenly returned.\n\n\"There's one more thing...\" As soon as he walked in, he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He froze for a moment, then pointed directly at Zhou Ze, \"You bastard, you're still going to call the police, aren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone! Give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You're going back on your word, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly entered an agitated and excited state. His mental state seemed to be a bit problematic, perhaps due to long-term exposure to a gambler's lifestyle and being out of touch with society. He was often prone to extreme reactions due to certain stimuli.\n\nThe other party lunged forward. Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to retreat.\n\nIn his previous life, he was a doctor, not a boxer, nor had he practiced martial arts. This current body was also somewhat frail. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was genuinely flustered.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe man crashed into Zhou Ze, pinning him against the wall, while his hands began to tightly grip Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I dare you to call the police, I dare you to call the police, I dare you to go back on your word. Fine, I'll make you die, really die! This time, I'll strangle you and then bleed you out! Let's see if you still don't die!\"\n\nThe man roared through gritted teeth.\n\nPoor bookstore business. In the afternoon, forget customers, there weren't even many pedestrians outside the door.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. During the struggle, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and grew long.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his hands around the other person's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, rolled his eyes, and immediately released Zhou Ze's neck. He stumbled back a few steps, knocked over several bookshelves, and then collapsed to the ground.\n\nZhou Ze was freed and rubbed his neck. He hadn't been too panicked before. After all, his fingernails could even harm devils in hell. Dealing with an ordinary person shouldn't be a big problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze still wasn't entirely clear about the specific origin and use of these fingernails. He only knew that they should have been \"infected\" by the old man he saved before his car accident.\n\nIt really was,\n\nIf you get gray nail fungus, it spreads to two.\n\nHe walked over, squatted down, and patted the man's face. Thankfully, he wasn't dead; he was still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n..................\n\nAfter finishing the police report at the police station, the police officer asked Zhou Ze to wait in the small lounge because the matter Zhou Ze reported was a bit strange. He said that someone came to rob him, but the one who was knocked out turned out to be the \"assailant,\" and this assailant was still in the hospital. They had to wait for him to wake up for further confirmation.\n\nHowever, at least the police officer didn't handcuff Zhou Ze.\n\nNext to Zhou Ze, a middle-aged man was squatting, his left hand locked to the radiator.\n\n\"Bro, you're awesome! That guy tried to rob you, and you knocked him out?\" The disheveled middle-aged man said while rubbing his long, mud-caked bangs, \"You really have my style from when I was young. You have to beat those reckless petty thieves to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you behave yourself!\" A young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. \"This is your how many times stealing electric bike batteries this winter?\n\nI'm telling you, the New Year is coming soon, can't you just settle down? Or find a proper job, earn some money, and send some home? How old are you?\"\n\n\"Working is impossible, I'll never work in this life. I don't know how to do business. Stealing electric bike batteries is the only way I can make a living. Going to the detention center feels like coming home.\n\nEveryone inside is talented, and they speak so nicely. I love it in there!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to bother with this guy anymore and turned to leave.\n\n\"Bro, how was my speech just now?\" The greasy middle-aged man winked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol. Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"I'm telling you, life has to be...\" The greasy middle-aged man froze, his gaze fixed on the doorway. \"Oh my goodness, she's so beautiful! Is she a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the doorway, a woman in a blue down jacket and long leather boots was walking towards them with another female police officer.\n\n\"She should be a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, her aura was her biggest asset.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a police uniform,\" the greasy man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe she's plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right. A beautiful police flower, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in more often in the future,\" the greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, still unsatisfied. \"If I could marry her, I'd be willing to lose ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He didn't dare to joke about lifespan and longevity anymore.\n\n\"You don't agree?\" The greasy man saw Zhou Ze shaking his head and anxiously said, \"You're blind! A woman like that, losing ten years of life for her, is absolutely worth it...\"\n\nAt that moment, the female police officer and the woman in long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to pick you up. The investigation over there is clear; you're free to go,\" the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" The greasy middle-aged man.\n\n---\n* \"生兒子沒*****兒的意思\" (shēng érzi méi pìyǎr de yìsi): A Chinese idiom roughly meaning \"to be so unethical or heartless that one's future generations will be cursed, specifically by being born without an anus.\" It implies extreme moral depravity. Translated literally as \"having a son but no asshole\" to retain the bluntness."

    "title": "第五章 陌生的夫妻",
    "content": "\"Officer, excuse me, what was my wife's name again?\"\n\nThis thought only crossed Zhou Ze's mind for a moment; he wasn't so foolish, but he truly didn't know his \"wife's\" real name. In this day and age, few people used their real names for their QQ or WeChat usernames.\n\nThe greasy man, however, cast Zhou Ze a resentful glance: *Brother, you're not playing fair. We said we'd be each other's fallen angels, didn't we?*\n\nZhou Ze returned a helpless glance: *I'm surprised too.*\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, \"My dumplings are delicious.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nHis \"wife\" said coolly, then turned and walked out.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow.\n\nShe drove a Porsche Cayenne and got straight into it.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.\n\nHonestly,\n\nit was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unlucky fellow, Xu Le, had a more normal marital and family life, then Zhou Ze wouldn't be in such an embarrassing situation. He could find excuses to explain his symptoms to a concerned wife, like feeling dizzy or having trouble remembering things.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the aura of an ice queen, seeming completely uninterested in engaging with him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like a mere formality.\n\n*My dog ran away and was found by the security guard,*\n\n*and I'm going to pick it up.*\n\nThat's the kind of feeling it was.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as him (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car drove onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence again.\n\nThe woman felt her husband was unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to investigate why.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She put it on speaker, and the voice from the other end came through the car's audio system:\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's just been a school bus collision on Youth Central Road. Casualties are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you to come back quickly.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly stunned.\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor,\n\nand,\n\nhis wife's surname was \"Lin.\"\n\n\"I understand, I'll be right back.\" The woman hung up the phone, immediately exited the elevated road at the next off-ramp, then made a sharp turn at the traffic light, heading towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi. Instead, she drove straight into the parking lot of Chongchuan District People's Hospital.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze was actually worried she'd tell him to get out and take a taxi home. He imagined having to shamelessly ask,\n\n\"Honey, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\nIt just seemed so silly.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got on the elevator, and Zhou Ze followed her into the elevator. The woman entered the women's changing room, and Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench by the corridor.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived. One person was critically injured, and five other children also had serious injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into her white coat and immediately get busy with treatment,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench, dazed.\n\nThis feeling was a bit like a mother bringing her son to work; the mother works, and the son watches and plays by himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe unique smell of disinfectant in the hospital and the stuffy feeling of the central air conditioning really made him nostalgic—a familiar feeling.\n\nAhead was the emergency room. The critically injured and life-threatening patient seemed to be a girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus that had the accident. Seeing the children crying out in pain on the operating tables, the scene was truly heartbreaking.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Normally, at this time, he would have already changed his clothes and joined the rescue efforts. He was the most famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, but now, he could only be a spectator.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. Moreover, this People's Hospital was publicly known as the best hospital in Tongcheng, and the quantity and quality of its doctors were unquestionable. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. Their injuries were lighter, requiring only wound care or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were stationed at the entrance to this floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, their emotions running high, but letting them in at this time could potentially hinder the rescue work, so they had to be held back for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the windowsill at the far end of the corridor, reached out to prop open the window, and then pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le smoked, so this was convenient.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital, you know.\"\n\nJust as he bit the cigarette butt into his mouth, a clear little girl's voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, pouting and looking at him angrily.\n\n*Cough, cough,*\n\nA bit awkward.\n\nZhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public etiquette was always a bit embarrassing.\n\n\"Little one, aren't you cold dressed like that?\" Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a bit of baby fat on her face, and big, lovely eyes, like an enlarged Barbie doll.\n\n\"Not cold at all.\" The little girl shook her head. \"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital anymore, okay?\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded very seriously.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine, but the other children are hurt, and they're in a lot of pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways and looked at the children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying; actually, it wasn't due to unbearable pain, but rather, if one person cried, the others followed suit.\n\nNurses were not only treating wounds but also trying to comfort the children.\n\nOutside, the parents, temporarily held back by the traffic police, were loudly arguing and shouting.\n\nIn short,\n\nthis floor felt chaotic.\n\n\"Then you're truly lucky,\" Zhou Ze remarked.\n\nThe little girl didn't have a single scar on her.\n\n\"Yep, I was sitting in the back row, so I'm fine.\" The little girl nodded, then actively ran over to comfort her classmates, looking here and there, encouraging and soothing them.\n\nShe was a very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, instinctively took out a cigarette again, then thought better of it and put it back.\n\nWhen he walked back to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors came out of the emergency room ahead.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor, the female doctor being his wife.\n\n\"It's okay, we did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to place a hand on Zhou Ze's wife's shoulder in comfort.\n\nAs a husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nbut he wasn't bothered by this scene...\n\nThat scoundrel Xu Le had left him such a complicated mess: a live-in son-in-law, a notoriously short-tempered sister-in-law, and clearly ill-tempered in-laws.\n\nZhou Ze was practically hoping his wife would quickly have an affair, kick him out, divorce him, and then he could just be alone.\n\nWho, having just died and been reborn into a new body, would bother with the complexities of a modern city's live-in son-in-law life?\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze's surprise, his wife directly used her hand to block the doctor's lingering hand, pointing at him and saying:\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\nThere was no hint of tenderness in her words, simple, stiff, as if she were saying: *This is my pet husky.*\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir.\" The male doctor's expression was a bit awkward. No matter what, hitting on someone's wife in front of them always felt a little lacking in confidence.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, acknowledging him. It seemed his wife was very virtuous... but he couldn't bring himself to be happy. It wasn't about being cuckolded.\n\nIt was simply, *how good it would be if life were simpler.*\n\n\"I'll go check over there again. The other children have all been handled, so there shouldn shouldn't be anything else. You and your husband should go back and rest early.\" The male doctor finished speaking and left.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves, throwing them on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and her pearly teeth were gently biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a very bad mood, which meant that the critically injured child hadn't been saved.\n\nShe looked very \"pitiful and adorable.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt some understanding for Xu Le in his heart. This live-in son-in-law earned at least a good deal more than his peers, with his in-laws' conditions being better than his own as a prerequisite. And then, this Dr. Lin, she truly was beautiful.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience much more of this in the future. Just seek peace of mind.\"\n\nZhou Ze, as an experienced person, comforted her from the side. His experience was much richer than his \"wife's,\" and his psychological resilience naturally much stronger.\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe woman replied with these two words. If Zhou Ze had spoken those words in his original capacity as a senior, it would indeed have been guidance;\n\nbut Zhou Ze was Xu Le now, and for him to say such things to Dr. Lin was purely speaking from a position of privilege.\n\n\"......\" Zhou Ze shrugged, inwardly disdaining Xu Le once more. *Look how much of a wimp you are, your wife dares to tell you to shut up in public.*\n\nDr. Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up: \"I'm going to change, then home.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt this moment, two nurses pulled back the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at it. He had seen many dead people. In all his years of practicing medicine, he had saved many lives, but there were also many patients who died right in front of him, where he was powerless to help.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, is this your husband?\" A young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but her husband, unlike the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses, had never shown up at the hospital.\n\nYou couldn't blame them for making a joke even when facing death. It's like asking those fresh, sentimental people who go to Tibet once and post on WeChat Moments about their purified and pious souls to stay there for ten years; they wouldn't be able to bear it. It's unrealistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin nodded, her emotions calmer now.\n\n\"Then you two should hurry home. Who knows what activities you might have planned? Right, Dr. Lin?\n\nLet me tell you, our Dr. Lin really loves children. You two should hurry home and...\"\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\n\"......\" The young nurse was speechless.\n\nZhou Ze saw the edge of a lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind buzzed, and he suddenly realized that the unscathed little girl he had just seen...\n\nShe wasn't human!"
