    "content": "Scooping a handful of water, Zhou Ze splashed it on his face. Slowly, he raised his head, looking at his reflection in the mirror, looking a bit haggard. As an emergency room doctor, this haggardness seemed to be standard.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is coming soon, seems to have fallen from a building, not sure if it's a suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called from the entrance of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there.\" Zhou Ze replied, then pulled out some tissue to wipe his face dry and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. On the stretcher lay an elderly man in a gray Tang suit. The old man was coughing incessantly, occasionally coughing up blood foam and fragments of internal organs. His entire body was covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the injured man's condition, and at the same time shouted to those ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe injured man's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these words at such a moment. After all, only a few can truly face death calmly. And as doctors, this is certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... it's really too terrifying down there...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Calm yourself, relax. Your life will be fine.\" Although his wrist felt a sharp pain, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want to... don't want to go down again... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp prick in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" the little nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, they were black, a translucent black, like amber, not like dirt was accumulated within them;\n\nAt this moment, the old man's fingernails had already embedded themselves into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly straightened his body and coughed violently. Then, his body trembled, and the hand gripping Zhou Ze's fell away. He became completely still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitation efforts, and the defibrillator was ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me take care of your wound.\" Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about minor flesh wounds. Their biggest concern was if the old man had other illnesses, which could put the doctor in a dangerous situation of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the old man's hand just now, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone was a bit down, but for them, this kind of thing was commonplace, and they would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, how about a check-up?\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, and then went to the hospital parking lot to drive away.\n\nJust as the car drove under the elevated section of Jianghai Avenue, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'll be right there. Please ask the children to wait a bit longer for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other side quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze checked the time again; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze pressed the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"BEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nA heavy truck ran the red light and drove towards him. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head to look at the dazzling high beams outside the car window,\n\nThen,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly flung into the air by the heavy truck. After tumbling several times in the air, it smashed onto the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up.\n\nHe found his body completely unable to move, as if it were stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he wanted to check his injuries right away, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he occasionally heard the sound of other vehicles passing by, and various horn honks.\n\n*Am I still at the scene of the accident?*\n\n*Am I still in the car?*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nPolice sirens sounded, along with the sound of fire trucks,\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance reached Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was slightly high; they must be cutting his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations, so he was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in the back of his car, and the Children's Day party for the orphanage kids, would all be ruined.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice called out.\n\n*It must be Dr. Chen from the hospital.*\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered a sudden, unexpected disaster.\n\nThere were also voices of a few nurses nearby. Because it was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, Dr. Chen's next words made Zhou Ze's heart plummet!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\n*No,*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*I'm not dead!!*\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt those heavy compressions, but he couldn't open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying voices of a few nurses he knew,\n\nDr. Chen punched the nearby car door, looking incredibly grief-stricken.\n\n*Hey!*\n\n*Don't give up!*\n\n*Don't give up!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I must be in a state of suspended animation right now,*\n\n*Excessive blood loss?*\n\n*Severe injuries?*\n\n*But I'm really not dead!*\n\n*I should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!*\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his mind.\n\nBut then, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher, likely being put into an ambulance.\n\nFollowing that, he heard the sound of the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut this crying was particularly harsh in Zhou Ze's ears.\n\n*He wasn't dead,*\n\n*Why were they crying!*\n\n*Why cry!*\n\n*Look at me again,*\n\n*Look at me again,*\n\n*Check again,*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the hospital director speaking:\n\n\"Dr. Zhou is just gone, like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very serious. Dr. Zhou was severely injured, lost too much blood, and has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone, like that?\" Another vice president still didn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You incompetent doctors!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bastards!*\n\n*Bastards!*\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his superiors and elders.\n\nThey actually believed he was dead,\n\nBut could a dead person still hear and perceive?\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bastards,*\n\n*Brutes,*\n\n*Sons of bitches!!!!!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\nThe stretcher began to move. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it, someone just gone, like that. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"There are unforeseen events in life, and misfortune can strike at any time. Just try to see it that way.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze struggled incessantly, trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut the feeling he had now was like sleep paralysis. No matter how hard he tried, his body simply wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair,\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted,\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and the stinging sensation was very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, hold on. He's been completely smashed up like this; how could makeup be so quick?\"\n\n\"The hospital is already rushing us, they need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it then?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit angry, pressing down harder with the makeup brush. Of course, their clients were dead people, who naturally wouldn't feel pain or complain. They only needed to make the living see the results.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush pressing down on his face,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, let them in. We're done here.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed into clothes. Then, he was pushed out, and the hospital orderlies lifted him into a soft, confined space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be a cold storage casket.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly cut off.\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the cold storage casket must have been opened.\n\nWhat he heard,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe hospital director was speaking into a microphone, praising him, lamenting his loss,\n\nThen came the vice director, and the head of the department, and others.\n\nAround,\n\nHe occasionally heard footsteps passing by,\n\nSome people just walked quietly past, taking a last look at him,\n\nSome even tried to call out to him a few times, with a crying voice,\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nThe viewing,\n\nOf my remains!\n\n*I'm not dead,*\n\n*I'm really not dead,*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*Not dead!*\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe started trying to exert himself again,\n\nBut still couldn't,\n\nHe could only hear, and feel,\n\nBut couldn't speak,\n\nNor open his eyes,\n\nEveryone thought he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying around him.\n\nThey cried sincerely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who grew up in an orphanage. Therefore, after starting work, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident was also because he was rushing back to the orphanage to celebrate Children's Day with the children that night.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but your compensation will be given to the orphanage, don't worry.\" The vice director stood beside Zhou Ze and said.\n\nAfterward,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again; the lid of the cold storage casket must have been closed once more.\n\nThen came another bout of bumps,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the cold storage casket was opened again.\n\nAround him, it was somewhat quiet. Occasionally, he heard human voices, but they weren't noisy.\n\nTwo people, one grabbing his shoulders and one grabbing his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which seemed to be made of steel.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, there were faint, indistinct sounds of crying.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't been able to discern where he was at first,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood,\n\n*Bastards!*\n\n*They sent me to the crematorium!*\n\n*They're going to burn me!*\n\n*I'm not dead, you bastards!*\n\n*Fuck your ancestors!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*Not dead yet!*\n\n*Don't cremate me,*\n\n*Don't cremate me!*\n\n*I'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*\n\n*You beasts,*\n\n*Mutts!*\n\n*Sons of bitches!!!!!*\n\nThis time, it was Zhou Ze's most frantic, most insane outburst,\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty, he hadn't started a family, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed on her cheek.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get back.\" The girl's mother reprimanded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was incredibly afraid!\n\n*No,*\n\n*No,*\n\n*No!*\n\n*I'm not dead, I'm really not dead!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\nNo one could hear his pleas,\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for feeling grieved,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing on tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being pushed into a narrow place filled with the smell of oil residue,\n\nThen,\n\nA viscous liquid was sprayed onto him,\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nThen,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nExtremely hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere..."

    "content": "Midnight streets,\n\nThe streetlights yellow,\nThe people frantic,\nThe weather cold, with a wind like a knife cutting into one’s skin.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\nHe didn’t know where this was again,\nBut he knew one thing:\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe had died, but he had come back.\nHe didn't know what to do,\nSo he just mechanically and numbly continued walking forward.\nHe didn't have the time to think about too many other things right now,\nSuch as the place he had just been to,\nSuch as the old man he had saved before his car accident,\nSuch as the faceless woman in the pond wearing a red dress,\nSuch as... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyous event, but even when people occasionally walked by, and no matter how hard he tried to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\nHe was excluded, isolated by this world.\n\nThose who haven't experienced being put in \"solitary confinement\" won't understand the pain of complete isolation. For Zhou Ze, the entire world right now was his prison, and a black cloth had been draped over it.\n\nNo one could see him,\nNo one could communicate with him,\nHe couldn’t pick up anything solid,\nEven,\nThe wind could easily blow right through him.\nHe was so frail,\nThe phrase \"weak as a willow\" was not an exaggeration for him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that,\nHe could see faint specks of light constantly dissipating from his body,\nIn other words,\nHis body was slowly fading away.\nPerhaps in another quarter of an hour, he would completely disappear, every last insignificant trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn’t know how all this had happened, but he knew that he truly didn’t have much time left.\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Tie Guai Li entered the body of a starving, collapsed person in the form of a soul, thus becoming the image he was known for in later generations.\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"possessing a corpse to return to life.\" He wanted to possess a corpse to return to life. He was very cold and panicked. He needed a physical body to attach himself to.\nHe didn't even care who that person was.\n\nPeople are always selfish in such situations, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\nHowever, whenever he tried to approach someone, a glow would appear above their head and shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even suffered harm from this, accelerating his \"evaporation\" rate.\n\nHe was a bit tired, a bit numb,\nHe was waiting for his end,\nWaiting for his demise.\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him more composed.\nFurthermore, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he stayed here, the longer he would suffer torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a shop still lit, seemingly a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\nSomeone pushed the door open and walked out; it was a man in a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his face wasn't clear. He looked left and right for a moment, then hurried away.\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze hadn't felt anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura emanating from inside the bookstore.\nYes,\nA warm aura.\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel somewhat bewildered, but he was like a person on the verge of freezing to death who suddenly finds a box of matches; even knowing the matches won't save his life, he would still strike them to feel a last bit of warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked over. His body passed directly through the bookstore’s glass door, and he continued inside, reaching behind the bookshelves.\nBehind the bookshelves,\nLay a person,\nIt was a young man with a handsome face, probably around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the store, he wasn’t wearing much clothing, just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\nHe lay on the ground, but from him, Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling, like a pauper walking down the street at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\nThis allure was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, in his current state, had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over, knelt down in front of the young man,\nHe didn't know how to enter the other's body, but he knew how to access the warmth he needed.\nHe extended a hand, placing it on the other's chest,\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embedding into the other's body.\nThis was a very strange feeling, different from the \"breeze\" blowing through his body when he walked down the street earlier. This was a merging, a fusion using his fingernails as a medium.\nSlowly, Zhou Ze’s entire being began to enter the other’s body. The two began to overlap.\n\n………………\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was awakened by a series of shoves. No, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, where his hands had previously been propped.\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\nThe woman's voice was sharp and shrill, filled with a domineering tone.\n\nRaising his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, more accurately, she should be a girl, probably high school age. Although she was a big girl, she still had a touch of childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what exactly do you mean? You think you're so tough, huh? You want to give my parents and my sister attitude, huh? You actually dared not come home all night last night!\nWho gave you the nerve?!\"\n\nXu Le?\nWho is that?\nZhou Ze vaguely spread his hands and found that his hands were very smooth. His previous hands had some calluses from prolonged practice with surgical instruments, but these hands did not.\n\n\"Hey, I’m talking to you!\"\nThe girl slapped the counter, full of aggression.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection: a strange face. No, he had seen this face before—the face he had seen last night.\nThis body,\nIs it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are really angry, and my mom is even throwing a tantrum at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now comes from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\nWho are you trying to put on a show for?!\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe me, I'll come over and smack you!\"\n\nThe girl made to raise her palm, but then she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" was not flinching and begging for mercy as he usually did. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\nAt this point, she checked the time and realized it was already seven-thirty.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school first. I'll settle accounts with you tonight!\"\nThe girl walked off, huffing.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop there, and a mobile phone next to it.\nEven now, he still hadn't adapted to the transition of his identity.\nHe was Zhou Ze, a renowned young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\nAnd now,\nHe had become this person.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nI am... a live-in son-in-law?\nDo I have a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his sister-in-law when speaking to his \"brother-in-law\" just now, his \"live-in son-in-law\" status truly conformed to ancient traditions.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-to-door\" son-in-law, was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even comparable to criminals; during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forcibly conscripted for border defense often included live-in sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up the phone. It had no password, perhaps because the original owner was lazy or dared not set one. At least, for now, it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\nThere were few people on the QQ list, just a few junior high, high school, and college classmates. Then there was a family list with only one person, labeled \"Wife.\"\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her, it was empty.\nAlright,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to search. He found the woman labeled \"Wife.\" Here, there were replies, mostly Xu Le asking things like what to eat tonight, what to prepare tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how his body was, a whole lot of questions.\nAnd the other party's replies were often perfunctory and cold,\nUsing:\n\"Oh\"\n\"Hmm\"\n\"Okay\"\nto respond.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails were no different from a normal person's.\nBut in saving the old man before his car accident, escaping from the faceless woman, and entering this guy's body, his fingernails had played an extremely crucial role.\n\nMind moves as desired,\nAt this moment,\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly growing longer, simultaneously becoming pitch-black and translucent, with faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n\"Whew...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nClosed his eyes,\nAnd when he opened them again,\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort caused by the identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, perhaps forgetting or simply not feeling hungry.\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District, not far apart.\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze sighed and quietly stood up. Since he was here, he would make the best of it.\nHe began to try cleaning the bookshelves, at least to give himself something to do.\nThe old man who had choked him before he died had said \"he's been found,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said \"you'll be caught eventually,\" creating a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze's heart.\nHis current state was \"barely surviving.\" To die and be resurrected was an immense stroke of luck, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to embody this identity and ideally not cause too much abnormality, so as not to attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this shop was really bad. The decline of the traditional book market hadn't been a one- or two-day affair, and this place wasn't on a prime street near a school gate.\nOne could only say that Xu Le’s choice to open a bookstore here might not even break even.\n\nIt wasn't until three in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\nThe customer browsed the children's books section for a long time.\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What kind of genre are you looking for?\"\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't really understand.\n\"Just looking around,\" the other person replied.\n\"Hmm.\" Zhou Ze didn't bother him anymore. He hadn't yet settled into his role as \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut just then,\nThe other person suddenly walked behind him and said quietly:\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\"Last night I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and stole your money,\nAnd I even specifically checked,\nYou clearly weren’t breathing then.\""
