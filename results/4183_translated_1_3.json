    "content": "Zhou Ze scooped up a handful of water and splashed it on his face, then slowly raised his head, looking at himself in the mirror, slightly haggard. As an Emergency Room doctor, this haggardness seemed like a standard feature.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient will be here soon, looks like they fell from a building, not sure if it was a suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the entrance of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there,\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out a tissue, wiped the water droplets dry, and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an elderly man dressed in a grey Tang suit. The old man was coughing incessantly, occasionally coughing up bloody foam and fragments of spleen tissue, his entire body covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition, and at the same time shouted to the people ahead: \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very poor.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say things like this at such times; after all, those who can truly face death calmly are few. And as a doctor, this is certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down... down... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at Zhou Ze with a solemn expression.\n\n\"Calm down, relax, your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist was aching, Zhou Ze still didn't try to pull free.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down there again... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, they were black—a translucent black like amber, not like dirt was accumulated within them.\n\nAnd at this moment, the old man's fingernails had already embedded themselves into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... Haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly straightened up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, the hand that was gripping Zhou Ze's fell away, and his entire body became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the Emergency Room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitative measures, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me treat your wound for you,\" Wang Ya said, walking over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about this minor flesh wound. What they worried about most was if the old man had other diseases, which could put the doctor at risk of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the old man's hand just now, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, if contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the Emergency Room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone's mood was somewhat down, but for them, such things were common, and they would quickly adjust.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, you should get checked out,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something else tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked straight to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot and drove away.\n\nThe car had just driven under the Jianghai Avenue overpass when Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"My apologies, Principal Wu, a patient delayed me. I'm on my way now, please ask the children to wait for me a little longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other end quickly hung up the phone.\n\nZhou Ze checked the time again; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green. Zhou Ze pressed the accelerator and drove through.\n\n\"HONK!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAnd at this very moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran the red light and drove over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look at the blinding high beams outside the car window,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"CRASH!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper before the heavy truck, was directly sent flying, and after tumbling several times in the air, it crashed to the ground.\n\n............\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up.\n\nHe found that his body was completely unable to move, as if it was stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he wanted to check his injuries immediately, but he couldn't move.\n\nAll around, there were occasional sounds of other vehicles passing by, and various honking sounds.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe wail of police sirens came, along with the sound of fire trucks.\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance reached Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a bit high; they must be cutting his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations, and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity. The cake in his back trunk and the orphanage children's Children's Day party were now ruined.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. At least he had saved his life. This could count as an unforeseen calamity, right?\n\nThere were also sounds of several nurses nearby, but because the surroundings were too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear clearly.\n\nBut then, one sentence from Dr. Chen sent Zhou Ze's heart plummeting!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has lost his vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze sensed someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression, but he couldn't open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the sound of several nurses he knew crying.\n\nDr. Chen punched a nearby car door, appearing utterly distraught.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nAbsolutely don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of suspended animation,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injury?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared frantically in his mind.\n\nBut next, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher, and presumed he was being placed inside the ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, came the sound of the ambulance driving away.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying was particularly grating in Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nWhy cry!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leaders speaking:\n\n\"So Young Zhou is just gone?\"\n\n\"The accident was very serious. Dr. Zhou was severely injured, lost too much blood, and has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone like that?\" Another Vice President still couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Young Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed relentlessly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, let alone his leaders or elders.\n\nThey had actually determined that he was dead,\n\nBut can a dead person still hear sounds and feel things?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nAnimals!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The President said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it, someone is just gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"There's no telling what the weather will bring, and misfortune can strike at any time. Just try to see things clearly.\"\n\nAfter saying these things, the two nurses left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty.\n\nThat chilling coolness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze struggled incessantly, constantly wanting to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like being \"pressed by a ghost\"*, no matter how hard he tried, his body was simply beyond his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair.\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n..................\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he sensed a faint coolness on his face and a distinct stinging sensation.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, wait. He was hit so badly, how could the makeup be done that quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital is rushing us; they're about to send him to the memorial service.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it then?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people; dead people naturally wouldn't feel pain, nor would they complain, so they just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush pressing repeatedly on his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. We're done with our work.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being dressed. Immediately after, he was pushed out, and the hospital orderlies lifted him into a soft, confined space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be a cooling coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly cut off.\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBumping...\n\nHe didn't know how much time had passed, but Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The cooling coffin lid must have been opened.\n\nWhat he heard,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe hospital President was giving a speech with a microphone, praising him, lamenting his loss,\n\nThen came the Vice President, department heads, and so on.\n\nAround him,\n\nThere were occasional sounds of footsteps.\n\nSome just quietly walked past, taking one last look at him,\n\nOthers tried to call his name a few times, their voices choked with sobs.\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe started trying again,\n\nBut it was still no use.\n\nHe could only hear and feel,\n\nBut he couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes.\n\nEveryone believed he was dead,\n\nBut he knew clearly,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying by his side.\n\nTheir tears were sincere, because Zhou Ze himself had grown up in an orphanage. For this reason, after starting work, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident also happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage that evening to celebrate Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Young Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You don't have family, but your compensation will be given to the orphanage, so rest assured,\" the Vice President said, standing by Zhou Ze's side.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again. The cooling coffin lid must have been closed once more.\n\nThen came another period of bumping,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe cooling coffin lid was opened again.\n\nAll around, it was somewhat quiet. Occasionally, human voices could be heard, but they weren't noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and the other his legs, lifted him up, and placed him on another cold rack, which felt like a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skillful, extremely skillful.\n\nAround him, there were faint, indistinct sounds of crying.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't discern where he was now,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood.\n\nBastards!\n\nThey had sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nFuck your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou animals!\n\nBastards!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis time, it was Zhou Ze's most frenzied and most frantic moment.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would directly face death!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he truly was unwilling. He was not yet thirty; he hadn't started a family; he didn't have children yet; he still had a life to live; he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw this uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice rang out nearby.\n\n\"SMACK!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense! I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother rebuked.\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nBecause no matter how he struggled,\n\nNo matter how he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside could not perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of this, he was utterly terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his pleas.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for grieving,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this procedure,\n\nAnd then going home for dinner, and continuing with their lives tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being pushed into a narrow place full of the smell of oil residue.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA viscous liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what this was,\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nExtremely hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nGreat fire,\n\nFire everywhere............\n\n---\n*   \"Ghost pressing on bed\" (鬼壓床): A common Chinese term for sleep paralysis, a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up.",

    "content": "cold,\n\n\n\nSo cold...\n\n\n\nZhou Ze didn't know why it was so cold here.\n\n\n\nHe walked on a secluded path. On both sides of the path, he was filled with flowers, without any romantic and beautiful atmosphere. The flowers were full of laughter, like ridicule, or like a spectator.\n\n\n\nFlowers open to the other shore, and people go to rebirth;\n\n\n\nZhou Cheng remembered that his last memory was fire, fire, and the terrifying flames completely swallowed himself, and the heart-pounding heat temperature baked himself into ashes\n\n\n\nBut in the eyes,\n\n\n\nHe came here\n\n\n\nThere are actually many people on this road.\n\n\n\nThere is an old man,\n\n\n\nHave children,\n\n\n\nThere are also young and middle-aged people.\n\n\n\nThere are men and women,\n\n\n\nEveryone wears different clothes\n\n\n\nSome people wear very simple clothes, some people wear big and purple clothes, with overly divided cheeks on their faces\n\n\n\nEveryone was walking on tiptoe,\n\n\n\nNo one said anything,\n\n\n\nNo one made any other sounds.\n\n\n\nOnly the occasional \"scrub\" sole friction sound left\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was also walking numbly with everyone. He was constantly looking back and looking back, and he realized where he had come.\n\n\n\nHe is already dead;\n\n\n\nAnd here,\n\n\n\nIt's a landlord\n\n\n\nHere is the world of the dead and the fate of the dead.\n\n\n\n  Own,\n\n\n\nFinally, I'm still dead\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what to do, nor did he know what choice he should make.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't want to die, and people don't want to die, but in this place, he has no idea what to do. He is confused and helpless\n\n\n\n\"Yaah……………………………………………………………………”\n\n\n\nThe cool little tunes are transmitted from afar.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze glanced over and saw the red flowers coming from afar, while others around him were all familiar with it. He continued to tiptoe his feet and walked forward.\n\n\n\nAfter getting closer, Zhou Ze saw clearly that the flowers were peach blossom papers. Along the way, there was a group of women, standing in a team, holding the papers, and walking gracefully\n\n\n\nThey are tall and have a stylish body. They are all wearing purple cheongsams and walking. The flesh color of their thighs is constantly exposed. The confusing charm makes people palpitations.\n\n\n\nWomen wear hair buns, meticulous, and even their steps are neat, as if they are the most outstanding singing and dancing groups in the world. Moreover, they have been practicing for more than a hundred years.\n\n\n\nThey are walking,\n\n\n\nThey are moving forward,\n\n\n\nFrom one end of the little one to the other,\n\n\n\nBy chance,\n\n\n\nPassed in front of Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nElaborate makeup, snow-white skin, and the cool and cold tuning that made me hummed create an old Shanghai atmosphere with a hazy rain.\n\n\n\nEvery woman wears a bracelet on her wrist, which is of different colors and sizes. The white and white wrists holding their snow-white wrists are even more dazzling.\n\n\n\n  pity,\n\n\n\nThey are not walking in the commercial pedestrian area of South Street.\n\n\n\nIt is not the golden and brilliant high-end clubhouse,\n\n\n\nThey stepped on the Huangquan Road,\n\n\n\nWhat is plundering is the sea of flowers on the other side.\n\n\n\nThey were blindly obedient, the latter stared at the former,\n\n\n\nThe former,\n\n\n\n  The eyes are empty\n\n\n\nWhen the last woman passed by Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nThe woman suddenly turned her head and looked at Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nThe world is the most beautiful.\n\n\n\n  now,\n\n\n\nJump directly to another extreme\n\n\n\n  fear\n\n\n\nOf course it's terrifying\n\n\n\n  Nausea\n\n\n\nOf course I feel disgusted\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze is already a dead person, and people will be scared to death, but what about ghosts\n\n\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at the woman.\n\n\n\nThe two have short eyes and a little intertwined. Then, the woman continued to walk forward, her figure was swaying, and her back was circling, and the tightness of the cheongsam outlined her beautiful figure very vividly.\n\n\n\n\"Where are you... going?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously followed the woman forward, and then left the original team.\n\n\n\nAnd the little boy murmured the walking people,\n\n\n\nThere was no one looking here, they seemed to be unable to think or perceive, and Zhou Ze seemed to be the difference among them.\n\n\n\nA group of women, smoking step by step, kept walking forward, murmuring, as if purity was like ice;\n\n\n\nThe originally suppressed environment makes people feel more reckless because of their appearance.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk forward, and he followed them\n\n\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw them walking into the pool in front one by one.\n\n\n\nThe pool is not big.\n\n\n\nLike a lens,\n\n\n\nTheir entry seemed to break this silence and blow a layer of ripples\n\n\n\nThe women in the front were no longer in the water, and the women behind were also following.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked to the pool. He did not go down with him, he just stood on the side and watched.\n\n\n\nEverything here is a place that is absolutely unfamiliar to him. Anyone, a single child, only has one chance to come in, and after entering, he can't go out again.\n\n\n\nSomething floated out in the middle of the pond water.\n\n\n\nIt's a double handed,\n\n\n\n  A red hands are white,\n\n\n\n  Detailed green pills,\n\n\n\nThe two hands danced gracefully, like a dream, making people's eyes instantly attracted to it and could no longer move.\n\n\n\nBeauty is attractive, and this kind of beauty is fascinating\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly showed an intoxicated look in his eyes, and he couldn't help but start moving forward without even knowing thatFirst, the foot,\n\n\n\nThe tightness followed by the knees,\n\n\n\nNext to the waist,\n\n\n\nIn the end,\n\n\n\nThe water surface is not in the neck.\n\n\n\nEven the whole person entered the pond\n\n\n\nThe water in the pond is not cold, it is even very warm, the water surface is clear, and it is very visible. When you enter here, you will feel no pain of suffocation.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw the women who were holding paper in the previous team. They were moving under the water, and they continued to move forward.\n\n\n\nAnd the closest location to you,\n\n\n\nThere is a woman in red clothes. She is standing under the water, but her hands are dancing on the water surface.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze began to approach this red woman.\n\n\n\nNot because of beauty,\n\n\n\nIt is not because of other false influences.\n\n\n\nBut because this woman seems to have an indecipherable magic that makes you approach, get close, and make you unable to help yourself.\n\n\n\n  finally,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze approached her.\n\n\n\nAnd her hands slowly closed off the water\n\n\n\nThe woman has long and dense hair, and she is dancing in the waves, making it difficult for people to see her face clearly\n\n\n\n\"Finally... wait for someone like this again...\"\n\n\n\nThe woman's voice is crisp, sweet and glutinous.\n\n\n\nCharming heart\n\n\n\nThe woman's beautiful hands stretched out and put them on Zhou Ze's shoulder. This action was very affectionate\n\n\n\n\"You... come and accompany me...\"\n\n\n\nNext moment,\n\n\n\nThe woman's hair began to scatter, and the long green silk began to blow around the face;\n\n\n\nThe beauty brushed her face, which seemed to be a very emotional thing, but then the woman's hair turned into the most imperfect steel cable in the world, and began to tie up her neck.\n\n\n\n\"You come and accompany me...\"\n\n\n\nThe hair is loose and no longer covered.\n\n\n\nThe woman's face finally appeared.\n\n\n\nShe has no face.\n\n\n\nHer face is flat, without any wavy, and without pleats. This is a very smooth face, enough to make thousands of girls jealous and admiration.\n\n\n\nBut she has no nose, no mouth, no eyes, and no ears.\n\n\n\nFaceless...female\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt that he could not breathe, and his chest was about to explode. At the same time, his body seemed to be about to collapse.\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman's smile is still crisp and empty, but at this time, Zhou Ze's ears are like magical sounds.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze has come to sober.\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what it meant to be scattered in this way in this place.\n\n\n\nBut in short,\n\n\n\nIt won't be a good ending\n\n\n\n\"You are here... accompanying me...\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl continued to smile and her hair danced\n\n\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously stretched out his hand to grab the hair that was lying on his neck. He wanted to try hard to remove it.\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl felt very interesting about his overestimating her abilities.\n\n\n\n\"If you can't kill, don't slap it. Those who can walk here are spirits, and those with spirits. If I swallow them, I will have the chance to go back.\n\n\n\nYou make a reservation,\n\n\n\nWill become,\n\n\n\nMy offerings”\n\n\n\nBut just as the voice just fell,\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman exclaimed: \"How is it possible... impossible...\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's ten-finger nails began to grow slowly, with a dark and transparent color. In this pool, the strange light belonging to it was flashing. The color of this nail was exactly the same as the nail color of the old man who Zhou Ze treated before his death.\n\n\n\n\"Sizzy......izzy......\"\n\n\n\nThe sound of the hot water oil kettle is transmitted,\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman's hair was furious and melted and collapsed when she touched Zhou Ze's nails, while Zhou Ze's figure began to slowly retreat and began to remove the faceless woman's thigh.\n\n\n\n\"Impossible...Impossible...This is impossible...Why can you leave too\n\n\n\nWhy can you leave me too?\n\n\n\n  Why\n\n\n\n  Why\n\n\n\nThis is unfair\n\n\n\nUnfair”\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman used her hands to hold Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nBut when Zhou Ze used his hands to remove the nails, once his nails touched the faceless hand, the faceless girl's originally perfect and flawless jade hand was burned out.\n\n\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman screamed,\n\n\n\nThe body began to retreat, and since then, he has lost control of Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's body began to float up.\n\n\n\n Absent from the surface\n\n\n\n\"You can't escape...you will be...you will be caught back\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n\n\nIt is the fate of the deceased\n\n\n\nYou, you and them, even if they leave, will eventually be caught back.\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman shouted and roared hysterically below.\n\n\n\nShe was jealous,\n\n\n\nShe admires it,\n\n\n\nShe was crazy\n\n\n\nAnd the rising circumstance,\n\n\n\nAnd I slowly lost my own consciousness,\n\n\n\nThe Netherworld Yellow Spring Road,\n\n\n\nThe dazzling beauty of the other side of the shore,\n\n\n\nThe roar of the faceless woman,\n\n\n\nThe cheongsam woman's polite appointment,\n\n\n\nEverything,\n\n\n\nIt seems that they are all moving away from him......",

    "content": "On the midnight street, the streetlights were yellow, and people were flustered. It was very cold, and the wind, like knives cutting skin, was biting.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold. He didn't know where this was again, but he knew one thing: this was... the human world.\n\nHe had already died, but he had returned. He didn't know what he should do, and could only mechanically, numbly continue walking forward.\n\nHe currently didn't have the time to think about too many other things, such as the place he had just descended to, such as the old man he had treated before the car accident, such as the faceless woman in the pool wearing a red dress, such as... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a very joyous thing, but even if someone occasionally walked by, even if he tried his best to greet them, still no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe was excluded by this world, cut off. People who hadn't experienced \"solitary confinement\" wouldn't understand the pain of complete isolation, and for Zhou Ze, the entire world right now was his cage, and the cage was covered with a black cloth.\n\nNo one could see him, nor could anyone communicate with him; he couldn't pick up anything tangible, and even, even the wind could easily blow right through him.\n\nHe was so frail. The term \"too weak to withstand a gust of wind\" was truly not an exaggeration for him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that he could see faint points of light constantly dispersing from his body; in other words, his body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would completely vanish, with the last insignificant trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn't know how all of this had happened, but he was clear that he truly didn't have much time left.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li entered the body of a person who had starved to death and fallen, thus becoming the image passed down through later generations.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return a soul,\" and he also wanted to \"borrow a corpse to return a soul.\" He was very cold and also very panicked; he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nHe didn't even mind who this person was. People at this time are always selfish, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he prepared to approach someone, a fiery glow would appear above that person's head and on their shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even suffered harm because of it, accelerating his \"evaporation\" speed.\n\nHe was a bit tired, and a bit numb. He was waiting for his end, waiting for his finish.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him a bit more composed instead.\n\nMoreover, given Zhou Ze's current situation, continuing to linger here, the longer he lingered, meant the longer he would endure torture.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a storefront still lit up, appearing to be a bookstore, because through the glass door, rows of bookshelves could be seen inside.\n\nSomeone pushed the door open from inside and walked out. It was a man wearing a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his true face couldn't be clearly seen. After looking around for a while, he left in a hurry.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze, who was standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\n\nYes, a warm aura.\n\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze somewhat puzzled, but he was currently like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly received a box of matches; even if he knew the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike one to feel the last bit of warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked over there. His body passed directly through the bookstore's glass door, continued inside, and arrived behind the bookstore's bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves, lay a person, a handsome young man, probably twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the shop, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\n\nHe lay on the ground, but on him, Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling, like a pauper walking on the road at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\n\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, in his current state, also had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of this young man. He didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to touch the warmth he needed.\n\nOne hand reached out, placed on the other person's chest. Zhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embed themselves into the other person's body. This was a very eerie feeling, different from the \"breeze\" blowing through his body when he walked on the road earlier. This was a fusion, a merging using his fingernails as a medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other person's body. The two began to overlap.\n\n………………\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was awakened by a series of shoves. No, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, with his hands previously resting on it.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp, very high-pitched, and carried an air of command.\n\nRaising his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, to be precise, it should be a girl, probably high school age. Although she was a \"big girl,\" she still hadn't completely shed her childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what exactly do you mean? You've got guts now, huh? Want to give my parents and my sister attitude, huh? You actually dared not come home all night last night! Who gave you such guts?!\"\n\nXu Le?\n\nWho is that?\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion, finding them very smooth. His previous hands had developed some calluses from long hours of practicing with surgical instruments, but these hands had none.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slapped the counter, her manner aggressive.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection, an unfamiliar face. No, he had seen this face before; it was the face he had seen last night.\n\nThis body, is mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are angry, and my mom's still throwing a tantrum at home. Let me tell you, everything you eat, drink, and use now is from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house? Who are you trying to put on a show for?! If you dare not come home again tonight, believe me, I'll come over and smack you!\"\n\nThe girl made a gesture to raise her palm, but she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg for mercy as he usually did. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel somewhat scared.\n\nAt this point, she looked at the time and found it was already seven-thirty.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school first. I'll settle scores with you tonight!\"\n\nThe girl left huffily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down on the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a phone next to it.\n\nEven now, he still hadn't adapted to the process of his identity change.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng. Moreover, he was an orphan.\n\nAs a result, he had now become this identity. What did that girl just say? I'm... a live-in son-in-law?\n\nHave a wife? And a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" just now when speaking to her \"brother-in-law,\" his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly adhered to excellent ancient traditions.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"reverse marriage\" arrangement, was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even similar to criminals; during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced to serve on the frontier often included such men.\n\nHe picked up the phone. The phone had no password set; he didn't know if that guy was lazy or dared not set a password, but at least at this moment, it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThe QQ contacts list had few people: just a few middle school, high school, and university classmates. Then there was a family list, with only one person, noted as \"Wife.\"\n\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her: empty.\n\nAlright, Zhou Ze opened WeChat, tried searching, and found the woman noted as \"Wife.\" Here, there were replies. They were basically Xu Le asking about various things, such as what to eat tonight, what needed to be prepared tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had recently sold, how her health was—a whole bunch of questions.\n\nAnd the other party's replies were often very perfunctory and very aloof, consisting of: \"Oh.\" \"Mm.\" \"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This interpersonal relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails were no different from an ordinary person's.\n\nBut in matters like the old man he had treated before the car accident, his escape from the faceless woman, and his entry into this guy's body, his fingernails had played an extremely crucial role.\n\nAs his mind willed, just then, Zhou Ze found his fingernails slowly growing longer, and at the same time becoming jet-black and translucent. There was even a faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n\"Whoosh......\"\n\nHe let out a long breath, closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, his fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the sense of discomfort brought by his identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, unsure if he had forgotten or simply didn't feel hungry at all.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in Chongchuan District; now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\n\nBy afternoon, Zhou Ze finally sighed, quietly stood up, and decided to accept what had happened.\n\nHe began to try cleaning the bookshelves. In any case, he might as well find something to do for himself first.\n\nThe old man who had choked him before dying had said \"he's been discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said \"you'll be caught sooner or later,\" which created a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nHis current state was considered \"barely living.\" To die and be resurrected was a heaven-sent blessing, so he cherished it. At least, before he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to embrace this identity. It was best not to cause too much anomaly, and not to attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThis shop's business was truly bad. The slump in the traditional book market hadn't been a one- or two-day affair for a long time, and this place wasn't even on the prime \"golden street\" right outside a school gate.\n\nOne could only say that Xu Le choosing to open a bookstore here, whether it could break even was a question in itself.\n\nIt wasn't until three in the afternoon that the day's first customer walked in.\n\nThe customer wandered around the children's books section, and wandered for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then still walked over and asked, \"What kind of topic are you looking for?\"\n\n\"Just browsing,\" the other party replied.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze then ignored him, as he hadn't yet fully integrated into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut just then, the other party suddenly walked behind him and spoke eerily:\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and robbed you of your money. And I even deliberately checked, you clearly had no breath left then.\"",
