    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly lifted his head, looking at himself in the mirror, slightly haggard. As an emergency doctor, this haggardness seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. It seems they fell from a building, not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the entrance of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there.\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out some tissues to wipe off the water droplets and started to walk out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. On the stretcher lay an elder in a gray Tang suit. The elder was coughing incessantly, and from time to time, bloody foam and fragments of internal organs were coughed out, his entire body covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the injured person's condition, and at the same time shouted to those ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe injured person's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe elder opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these words at this moment. After all, only a minority can truly face death calmly, and as a doctor, this is certainly not the time to analyze the condition with the injured person and tell them what percentage chance they have of surviving. What the injured person needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Steady your emotions, relax. Your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist was hurting a bit, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull free.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down again... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" The little nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe elder's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, his fingernails were black, a translucent black similar to amber, not like dirt was accumulated within them;\n\nAt this moment, the elder's fingernails had already embedded themselves in the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly sat up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, the hand that was gripping Zhou Ze's fell away, and he became motionless.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe elder was wheeled into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began to perform resuscitation measures, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me take care of your wound.\" Wang Ya came over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about this minor skin injury. What they were most concerned about was the possibility of the elder having other illnesses, which could put the doctor in a dangerous situation of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the elder's hand just now, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome illnesses, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant that the person could not be saved.\n\nEveryone's emotions were a bit down, but for them, they had seen this kind of thing many times and would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, get a check-up.\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and left.\n\nAs soon as the car drove under the Jianghai Avenue viaduct, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now, please ask the children to wait for me a bit longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The call ended quickly on the other end.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"Honk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and drove over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look at the blinding high beam outside the car window,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly flung away by the heavy truck, rolling several times in the air before smashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up,\n\nHe found his body completely immobile, as if it was stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional instinct, he really wanted to check his injuries right now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he occasionally heard the sound of other vehicles passing by, and various horn honks.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car sounded, and then the sound of a fire truck,\n\nFinally, the familiar sound of an ambulance siren arrived, which brought Zhou Ze a sense of comfort.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was slightly high, so they must be cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a shame, the cake in his trunk and the Children's Day party for the orphanage kids would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a long breath in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered a sudden misfortune.\n\nThere were also sounds of several nurses nearby, but because the area was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear clearly.\n\nBut then, Doctor Chen's next words plunged Zhou Ze's heart into the depths of despair!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he still had consciousness, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression but couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying voices of several nurses he knew,\n\nDoctor Chen punched the nearby car door, looking very distraught.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI should be in a state of suspended animation right now,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injury?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his mind.\n\nBut then, he sensed that he was being lifted onto a stretcher, likely being placed into an ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, he heard the sound of the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded particularly harsh in Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy cry!\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leaders speaking:\n\n\"Dr. Zhou is just... gone?\"\n\n\"The accident was very serious. Dr. Zhou was severely injured, lost too much blood, and has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? Just like that, he's gone?\" Another vice president still couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone,\" said a department head's voice. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his superiors and elders,\n\nThey actually believed he was dead,\n\nBut can a dead person still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nYou mongrels,\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move. All around was quiet, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Su Qin, I just can't believe it, someone just... gone. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone like that?\"\n\n\"Nature has unpredictable storms, and man experiences unexpected misfortunes. Just try to see the brighter side.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze struggled incessantly, trying to resist, he wanted to wake up, he desperately yearned to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like sleep paralysis, no matter how hard he tried, his body was completely out of his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair,\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted,\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nIn the hospital,\n\nMortuary.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and the stinging sensation was very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" Someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, just wait. He's so mangled from the accident, how could the makeup be done that quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital's rushing us, they need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it then?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people, who naturally wouldn't feel pain or complain. They just needed to make it look good for the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle,\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush repeatedly pressing down on his face,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. Our work here is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed into clothes. Immediately after, he was pushed out, and the hospital orderlies carried him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be a cold storage coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly isolated,\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the cold storage coffin must have been opened.\n\nWhat he heard,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe director was speaking into a microphone, praising him, lamenting his loss,\n\nThen came the vice-director, the department head, and others.\n\nAround him,\n\nFootsteps occasionally passed by,\n\nSome just walked by quietly, taking a last look at him,\n\nSome tried to call out to him, with a choked voice,\n\nThis was the viewing of the deceased.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy deceased body!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe began to try and struggle again,\n\nBut still couldn't,\n\nHe could only hear, and feel,\n\nBut couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes,\n\nEveryone believed he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying by his side.\n\nThey cried sincerely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who grew up in an orphanage. Therefore, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident was also because he was rushing back to the orphanage to celebrate Children's Day with the children that evening.\n\n\"Xiao Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation to the orphanage, don't worry.\" The vice president stood beside Zhou Ze and said.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again, the lid of the cold storage coffin must have been closed again.\n\nThen another period of bumping,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the cold storage coffin was opened again,\n\nAll around, it was quiet, occasionally hearing human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one grasping his shoulders and one grasping his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which felt like a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, faint sobs could be heard.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't distinguish where he was again,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood,\n\nYou bastards!\n\nThey had sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou beasts,\n\nYou mongrels,\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was the most insane he had ever been, the most frantic,\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty years old, he had not yet started a family, he had no children, he still had a life to live, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, I'll deal with you when we get home.\" The girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was incredibly afraid!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being upset,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing on tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being pushed into a narrow place full of the smell of oil residue,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA sticky liquid sprayed onto his body,\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere...",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

For Zhou Ze, the entire world right now was his prison, and a black cloth had been thrown over the prison.\n\nNo one could see him,\nNor could anyone communicate with him,\nHe couldn't pick up any solid object,\nEven,\nThe wind could easily blow right through him.\nHe was so frail,\nThe phrase \"weak against the wind\" was absolutely no exaggeration when applied to him.\n\nAnd what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that,\nHe could see faint specks of light constantly dissipating from his body,\nIn other words,\nHis body was slowly fading.\nPerhaps in another quarter of an hour, he would completely disappear, every last insignificant trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this had happened, but he knew that his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li entered the body of a man who had starved to death as a soul, which is how he became known in later legends.\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return a soul.\" He wanted to borrow a corpse to return his soul; he was very cold and panicked. He needed a physical body to attach himself to.\nHe didn't even care who this person was.\n\nAt times like these, people are always selfish, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he tried to approach someone, lights would appear above their head and shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even suffered harm from this, accelerating his \"evaporation\" speed.\n\nHe was a little tired, and a little numb,\nHe was waiting for his end,\nWaiting for his finish.\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him a little more at peace.\nFurthermore, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would endure torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, a shop was still lit, seemingly a bookstore, because rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\nSomeone pushed the door open and walked out; it was a man in a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his face couldn't be clearly seen. He looked left and right for a moment, then hurriedly left.\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nInitially, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\nYes,\nA warm aura.\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel somewhat bewildered, but he was like someone on the verge of freezing to death who suddenly found a box of matches. Even though he knew the matches wouldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last bit of warmth before he died.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body passing directly through the bookstore's glass door. He continued inside, arriving behind the bookshelves.\nBehind the bookshelves,\nLay a person,\nIt was a handsome young man, probably around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the store, he wasn't wearing much clothing, just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\nHe lay on the ground, but Zhou Ze felt a sense of warmth from him, like a pauper walking down the road at night and finding a bag of gold coins.\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, in his current state, had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of the young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to touch the warmth he needed.\nHe extended a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embedding into the other person's body.\nThis was a very strange feeling, different from the \"breeze\" blowing through his body when he walked on the road earlier. This was a fusion, a merging using his fingernails as a medium.\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other person's body; the two began to overlap.\n\n...............\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was woken up by a series of shoves. No, more accurately, he was \"startled awake.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, where he had previously been resting his head on his hands.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, carrying an air of bossiness.\nZhou Ze looked up at the woman in front of him. No, more accurately, she should be called a girl, probably high school age. Although she was a big girl, she still had a bit of childishness about her.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what do you mean by this? You think you're so capable, huh? You want to give my parents and my sister a hard time, huh? How dare you not come home all night last night!\nWho gave you the guts?!\"\n\nXu Le?\nWho is that?\nZhou Ze spread his hands in a daze, finding his hands smooth. His own hands used to have calluses from long hours of practicing surgical instruments, but these hands didn't.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\nThe girl slapped the counter, full of aggression.\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection—an unfamiliar face. No, he had seen this face before; it was the face he had seen last night.\n\nThis body,\nIs it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are angry, and my mom is throwing a fit at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now comes from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to act so high and mighty in my house?\nWho are you trying to put on a show for?!\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe it or not, I'll come over and slap you directly!\"\n\nThe girl made a motion to raise her palm, but then she suddenly noticed that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg as he usually would. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\nAt this moment, she checked the time and saw that it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school now, I'll settle with you tonight!\"\nThe girl walked away angrily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a cell phone next to it.\nEven now, he still hadn't adjusted to the transition of his identity.\nHe was Zhou Ze, a renowned young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\nNow,\nHe had transformed into this identity.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nI'm... a live-in son-in-law?\nHave a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his sister-in-law towards her \"brother-in-law\" just now, this \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient traditions.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-to-door son-in-law,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even similar to criminals; during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced to serve on the frontier often included贅婿 (zhùixù).\n\nHe picked up the phone. It wasn't password-protected; perhaps the guy was lazy or didn't dare set one, but at least it made it easy for Zhou Ze to open his WeChat and QQ.\nThere were very few people in his QQ list, just a few junior high, high school, and college classmates. Then there was a family list with only one person, labeled \"Wife.\"\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her; it was empty.\nAlright,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to find her. He found the woman labeled \"Wife.\" There were replies here, mostly Xu Le asking about things like what to eat tonight, what to prepare tonight, how much money was needed for stock, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how his body was, a whole bunch of questions.\nAnd the other party's replies were often perfunctory and aloof,\nLike:\n\"Oh\"\n\"Hm\"\n\"Okay\"\nto replace them.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm. His fingernails were no different from an ordinary person's.\nHowever, in the events of saving the old man before his car accident, escaping from the faceless woman, and entering this guy's body, his fingernails had played a crucial role.\nAt his whim,\nAt this moment,\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly growing longer, becoming dark and translucent, with faint black mist lingering around them.\n\n\"Phew...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nClosed his eyes,\nAnd when he opened them again,\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning to noon, Zhou Ze sat there trying to adapt to his new identity, and to calm the discomfort caused by his identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, perhaps he forgot or simply didn't feel hungry.\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in Chongchuan District; now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\nBy afternoon, Zhou Ze sighed and silently stood up. Since he was here, he would make the best of it.\nHe started trying to clean the bookshelves, at least to give himself something to do.\nThe old man who had choked him before he died had said \"he was discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said, \"you will be caught eventually.\" These words had given Zhou Ze a sense of crisis.\nHis current state was \"barely alive.\" Dying and coming back to life was a stroke of divine luck, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to embrace this identity and ideally not cause too much abnormality or attract the attention of those \"who want to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this shop was genuinely bad. The decline of the traditional book market hadn't been a one or two-day affair, and this place wasn't on the golden street outside a school gate.\nOne could only say that whether \"Xu Le\" opening a bookstore here could even break even was questionable.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\nThe customer browsed the children's books section for a long time.\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What kind of genre are you looking for?\"\nAlthough Zhou Ze didn't really know either.\n\"Just looking around,\" the other person replied.\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze no longer paid attention. He hadn't yet fully immersed himself in the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\nBut just then,\nThe other person suddenly walked behind him and spoke eerily:\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and took your money.\nAnd I even specifically checked,\nYou clearly weren't breathing then.\"",
