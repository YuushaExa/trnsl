    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water, Zhou Ze splashed it on his face. He slowly raised his head and looked at his reflection in the mirror. He looked a bit haggard; for an emergency room doctor, this haggardness was practically standard issue.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is arriving any second! Looks like a fall from upstairs, not sure if it was a suicide attempt!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the doorway of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, be right there,\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out a paper towel to dry the water droplets from his face and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance soon pulled up to the hospital. On the gurney lay an old man dressed in a gray Tang suit. He was coughing incessantly, spitting up bloody foam and fragments of his spleen from time to time. His entire body was covered in blood.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the gurney while observing the patient's condition, simultaneously yelling to the people ahead, \"Prep the surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very poor.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, staring at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We're going to help you. You won't die.\"\n\nMost dying patients say things like this at a time like this. After all, few people can truly face death with calm. And as a doctor, this was certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell him his odds of survival. What the injured needed at this moment was psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down below... down below... it's really so terrifying down there...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly seized Zhou Ze's wrist, his face deadly serious as he stared at him.\n\n\"Please, calm down. Relax. Your life is not in danger.\" Although his wrist was aching, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want to... don't want to go back down... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp sting in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" a young nurse beside him cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were long, and for some unknown reason, they were black—a translucent black, like amber, not the kind from accumulated dirt.\n\nAnd at this moment, the old man's nails had dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going back down... not going back down... not going down... haha... *cough cough cough*...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat bolt upright, coughing violently. Then, his body shuddered, and the hand gripping Zhou Ze's fell away. He went still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze yelled.\n\nThe old man was rushed into the emergency room, where doctors and nurses began resuscitation procedures. The defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me treat your wound,\" Wang Ya said, walking over.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about a minor flesh wound like this. Their biggest fear was that the old man might have other diseases, potentially putting the doctors at risk of occupational exposure. After all, the old man's hands had just been covered in a lot of blood, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome illnesses, if you contracted them, could ruin your entire life.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nIt meant the man couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone's spirits fell a little, but for them, this sort of thing was a common sight. They would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, you should get tested,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the locker room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and drove away.\n\nJust as the car reached the Jianghai Avenue overpass, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now. Please have the children wait for me a little longer.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright.\" The person on the other end quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green. Zhou Ze stepped on the gas and drove forward.\n\n\"HONK!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAnd just then,\n\nA heavy-duty truck ran the red light and barreled towards him. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look out the window at the blinding high beams.\n\nThen,\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nBefore the heavy truck, the small car was like a fragile piece of white paper, sent flying on impact. It flipped several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze regained consciousness.\n\nHe found he couldn't move his body at all, as if he were pinned.\n\nAt the same time, he couldn't open his eyes. He knew he'd been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he wanted to check his injuries right away, but he was unable to move.\n\nAll around him were the sounds of other vehicles driving by, and various car horns.\n\n*Am I still at the crash site?*\n\n*Am I still in the car?*\n\nZhou Ze wondered to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of police sirens arrived, along with fire truck sirens.\n\nFinally, the familiar sound of an ambulance siren reached him.\n\nZhou Ze could feel his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a bit high; they must be cutting up his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with the procedures.\n\nWhat a shame. The cake in his trunk, and the Children's Day party for the orphanage kids, were all ruined.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his mind. At least he had survived. This could be considered a freak accident, he supposed.\n\nHe could hear the voices of a few nurses nearby, but it was too noisy, so he couldn't hear clearly.\n\nBut what Dr. Chen said next made Zhou Ze's heart sink to the bottom of a pit!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has no vital signs.\"\n\n*No.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*I'm not dead!!*\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his mind!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He could feel those heavy compressions, one after another, but he couldn't open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nHe hoped they would hurry up and realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the sounds of several nurses he knew, crying.\n\nDr. Chen punched a nearby car door, clearly grief-stricken.\n\n*Hey!*\n\n*Don't give up!*\n\n*Please don't give up!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I must be in a state of apparent death.*\n\n*Excessive blood loss?*\n\n*Severe injuries?*\n\n*But I'm really not dead!*\n\n*I should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!*\n\nZhou Ze roared frantically in his mind.\n\nBut then, he felt himself being lifted onto a gurney, probably being put into the ambulance.\n\nNext came the sound of the ambulance driving off.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut to Zhou Ze's ears, their cries were exceptionally grating.\n\nHe wasn't dead yet.\n\nWhat were they crying for!\n\nWhy were they crying!\n\n*Look at me again,*\n\n*Just look at me again,*\n\n*Check one more time,*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the voice of the hospital director:\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone, just like that?\"\n\n\"The car crash was very severe. Dr. Zhou's injuries were too extensive, he lost too much blood. Death has been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Really? He's gone just like that?\" another vice director asked, still in disbelief.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked him again myself.\"\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bunch of incompetent doctors!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bunch of bastards!*\n\n*Bastards!*\n\nZhou Ze cursed them endlessly in his mind. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, no longer his friends, and certainly not his superiors and elders.\n\nThey had actually declared him dead.\n\nBut could a dead person still hear and feel things?\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bunch of bastards,*\n\n*Animals,*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\nThe gurney began to move. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Little Ya, don't be so sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Suqin-jie,¹ I just can't believe it. A person, just gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he be gone just like this.\"\n\n\"The heavens are unpredictable, and fortune can turn on a dime. You just have to try and accept it.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty.\n\nThat grim, bone-chilling cold,\n\nwas so distinct.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, kept trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like sleep paralysis; no matter how hard he tried, his body was completely out of his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up, somewhat in despair.\n\nHe was tired.\n\nAnd exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now.\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, it was to a faint, cool sensation on his face. The stinging was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done yet?\" someone asked from the side.\n\n\"Don't rush me. Hold on, the man was all smashed up like this. How can the makeup be done so quickly.\"\n\n\"The hospital people are rushing us. They need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it, then.\"\n\nThe mortuary makeup artist seemed a little angry and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, her clients were the dead, and the dead certainly wouldn't say it hurt, nor did she have to worry about complaints. She just needed to produce results for the living to see.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nenduring the stinging pain as the makeup brush pressed repeatedly against his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt his clothes being changed. Then, he was pushed out, and the hospital orderlies lifted him into a soft, cramped space.\n\n*This,*\n\n*must be an ice coffin.*\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly cut off.\n\n*The lid must have been closed.*\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the ice coffin must have been opened.\n\nWhat he heard,\n\nwas a funeral dirge.\n\nThe director was holding a microphone and giving a speech. He was praising him, lamenting his loss.\n\nThen came the vice director, the department head, and so on.\n\nAll around,\n\nthere was the sound of footsteps passing by from time to time.\n\nSome people just walked past quietly, taking one last look at him.\n\nSome even tried to call his name a few times, their voices choked with tears.\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\n*The viewing...*\n\n*of my remains!*\n\n*I'm not dead.*\n\n*I'm really not dead.*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*Not dead!*\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his mind.\n\nHe started to try again,\n\nbut it was still no use.\n\nHe could only hear, and he could feel,\n\nbut he couldn't speak,\n\nand he couldn't open his eyes.\n\nEveryone was convinced he was dead,\n\nbut he himself knew,\n\nhe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage came too, crying beside him.\n\nTheir tears were sincere, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who had grown up in that orphanage. Because of this, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage at night to celebrate Children's Day with the kids.\n\n\"Little Zhou, you can go in peace. This time, it counts as a work-related incident. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation money to the orphanage. Don't you worry,\" the vice director said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nAfter that,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being sealed off again. The lid of the ice coffin must have been closed once more.\n\nThen another round of bumps,\n\nand finally, it stopped.\n\nThe ice coffin lid was opened again.\n\nIt was somewhat quiet all around, with occasional human voices that weren't disruptive.\n\nTwo people, one grabbing his shoulders and one grabbing his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which seemed to be a steel plate.\n\nThese two were practiced, very, very practiced.\n\nIn the background, there were faint, indistinct sounds of crying.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't figure out where he had been taken this time.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nhe suddenly understood.\n\n*You bastards!*\n\n*They sent me to the crematorium!*\n\n*They're going to burn me!*\n\n*I'm not dead, you bastards!*\n\n*Fuck your ancestors!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*Don't cremate me.*\n\n*Don't cremate me!*\n\n*I'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!*\n\n*You bunch of animals,*\n\n*You mutts!*\n\n*You sons of bitches!!!!!*\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was more frantic than ever, more insane than ever.\n\nHe knew,\n\nonce he was cremated,\n\nthere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would be facing death directly!\n\nA complete and total end!\n\nHe wouldn't accept it, he truly wouldn't accept it. He wasn't even thirty yet, he hadn't started a family, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long road ahead of him!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw that uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice said nearby.\n\n\"Smack!\" A small slap landed on her cheek.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nBecause no matter how he struggled,\n\nno matter how he roared in his mind,\n\nthe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started up.\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nand because of that, he was utterly terrified!\n\n*No.*\n\n*No.*\n\n*No!*\n\n*I'm not dead, I'm really not dead!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\nNo one could hear his cries.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nonly responsible for grieving,\n\nonly responsible for seeing this process through,\n\nand then going home to eat dinner, and carrying on with their lives tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being pushed into a narrow space that reeked of oily residue.\n\nThen,\n\na sticky liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what this was.\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nAnd then,\n\n\"Ssssss...\"\n\nScalding!\n\nIncredibly scalding!\n\nPain.\n\nSearing, burning pain!\n\nFire.\n\nFire.\n\nA great fire.\n\nFire everywhere...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  `素琴姐` (Sùqín jiě): \"Jie\" is an honorific suffix meaning \"older sister,\" used to address a female colleague or friend who is older, showing respect and closeness.",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

    "content": "午夜的街頭，\n\n\n\n  路燈黃黃，\n\n\n\n  人也惶惶，\n\n\n\n  天很冷，還有風，似刀子割人。\n\n\n\n  周澤也感到冷，\n\n\n\n  他不知道這裡又是哪裡，\n\n\n\n  但知道一件事，\n\n\n\n  這裡是……人間。\n\n\n\n  他已經死了，但又回來了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道自己該怎麼辦，\n\n\n\n  只能機械麻木地繼續往前走。\n\n\n\n  他現在沒有功夫去思考太多其他的事情，\n\n\n\n  比如自己剛剛下去的地方，\n\n\n\n  比如那個自己車禍前救治的老者，\n\n\n\n  比如水潭裡身穿著紅色衣裙的無面女，\n\n\n\n  比如……自己的指甲。\n\n\n\n  他回來了，本該是很喜悅的一件事，但哪怕身邊偶爾有人走過，哪怕他再用力地打招呼，也依舊沒人可以看見他和聽見他。\n\n\n\n  他被這個世界給排擠了，隔絕了。\n\n\n\n  沒嘗試過被關「禁閉」的人，不會了解那種被完全隔離的痛苦，而對於周澤來說，眼下整個世界，就是他的囚籠，囚籠上還蓋上了一層黑布。 \n\n\n\n  沒人能看見他，\n\n\n\n  也沒人能和他交流，\n\n\n\n  他拿不起任何一件有實的東西，\n\n\n\n  甚至，\n\n\n\n  連風都能夠從他身上輕而易舉地吹過去。\n\n\n\n  他是那麼的羸弱，\n\n\n\n  弱不禁風這個詞在他身上，真的是一點都不誇張。\n\n\n\n  而且，最讓周澤震驚和駭然的是，\n\n\n\n  他能看見自己身上不斷有淡淡的光點流散出去，\n\n\n\n  換言之，\n\n\n\n  他的身體正在慢慢地變淡。\n\n\n\n  可能再過個一刻鐘，自己就將徹底地消失不見，被抹去最後一絲微不足道的痕跡。\n\n\n\n  他不知道這一切到底是怎麼發生的，但他清楚，自己的時間，真的沒剩下多少了。\n\n\n\n  八仙里，鐵拐李就是以魂魄的方式進入了一位餓死倒地的人體內，才成了後世流傳那種形象。\n\n\n\n  周澤也聽說過關於鬼魂「借屍還魂」的故事，他也想去借屍還魂，他很冷，也很慌張，他需要一具肉體給自己去依附。\n\n\n\n  甚至，他不介意這個人是誰。\n\n\n\n  人在這個時候，總是自私的，周澤也不例外，而且，他是真的快受不了了。 \n\n\n\n  但是，每當他準備靠近一個人時，那個人的頭頂和雙肩位置都會出現光火，直接讓其無法靠近，甚至自己還因此受到了傷害，加劇了自己「揮發」的速度。\n\n\n\n  他有些累了，也有些麻木了，\n\n\n\n  他在等待自己的終結，\n\n\n\n  等待自己的結束。\n\n\n\n  作為一名已經死過一次的人，你讓他再面臨一次死亡，反而能夠變得更坦然了一些。\n\n\n\n  而且，以周澤現在的情況，繼續逗留在這裡，逗留得時間越久，也就是意味著他承受折磨的時間越長。\n\n\n\n  「吱呀……」\n\n\n\n  前面，有一家還亮著燈的店面，好像是一家書店，因為隔著店門玻璃可以看見裡面的一排排書架。\n\n\n\n  有人從裡面將門推開走了出來，是一名穿著衛衣的男子，男子戴著帽子，看不清楚真容，左顧右盼了一會兒，急匆匆離開了。\n\n\n\n  當然，男子是看不見距離他不到五米處所站著的周澤的。\n\n\n\n  原本，周澤沒覺得有什麼異常，但就在男子離開不久之後，周澤忽然自書店裡，感知到了一種溫暖的氣息。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  溫暖的氣息。\n\n\n\n  這種溫暖，讓周澤有些莫名其妙，但他眼下就像是一個即將凍死的人忽然得到一盒火柴一樣，哪怕知道火柴救不了自己的命但還是會劃開它讓自己在臨死前感知到最後的溫熱。 \n\n\n\n  周澤向那邊走過去，他的身體直接穿過了書店的玻璃門，繼續往裡走，來到了書店的書架後面。\n\n\n\n  書架後面，\n\n\n\n  躺著一個人，\n\n\n\n  是一個面容俊秀的年輕男子，年紀可能也就二十三四歲的樣子，因為店裡開著空調，所以他身上穿的衣服不多，也就一件長袖外加一件薄外套。\n\n\n\n  他躺在地上，但在他身上，周澤感知到了一種溫暖的感覺，就像是一個窮鬼，晚上走在路上撿了一袋子金幣。\n\n\n\n  這種吸引力，無法拒絕，而且現在的周澤，也沒資格去拒絕！\n\n\n\n  周澤走了過去，在這個年輕男子面前蹲了下來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道該如何去進入對方的身體，但他明白該如何去接觸自己所需要的溫暖。\n\n\n\n  一隻手伸出，放在對方的胸口位置，\n\n\n\n  周澤看見自己的指甲居然慢慢地嵌入到了對方的體內，\n\n\n\n  這是一種很詭異的感覺，不同於自己之前走在路上時「微風」吹過自己的身體，這是一種相融，以自己的指甲為媒介進行的一種融合。\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，周澤整個人開始進入到對方的體內，二者，開始了重合。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  「徐樂！你給我醒醒，醒醒！」 \n\n\n\n  周澤被一番推搡給吵醒，不，確切的說，是被「驚動」，他睜開眼，發現自己正坐在書店櫃檯後面，之前自己是雙手枕在上面。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你醒醒！」\n\n\n\n  女人的聲音很尖銳，很高亢，帶著一種頤氣指使。\n\n\n\n  抬起頭，周澤看著面前的女人，不，確切地說，應該是女孩兒，也就是高中生的年紀吧，雖然是大女孩兒了，卻還是有點稚氣未脫。\n\n\n\n  「喂，徐樂，你到底是什麼意思，你能耐了是吧，想給我爸媽給我姐臉色看了是吧，昨晚居然敢一宿沒回家！\n\n\n\n  誰給你的這個膽子！」\n\n\n\n  徐樂？\n\n\n\n  是誰？\n\n\n\n  周澤有些茫然地攤開手，發現自己雙手很平滑，自己以前的手可是因為長時間練習手術器械已經有了一些老繭，這雙手卻沒有。\n\n\n\n  「喂，我在和你說話呢！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒一巴掌拍在櫃檯上，氣勢洶洶。\n\n\n\n  周澤微微皺眉，站起身，走到了店門邊的玻璃鏡子前，他看見了自己的倒影，是一張陌生的臉，不，這張臉自己見過，是昨晚自己看見的那張臉。\n\n\n\n  這身體，\n\n\n\n  是我的了？\n\n\n\n  「喂，你什麼意思啊，我爸媽可都生氣了，我媽還在家裡發脾氣了呢，我告訴你啊，你現在吃的喝的用的都是我家的，你這個上門女婿有什麼資格在我家裡擺譜？ \n\n\n\n  你想做樣子給誰看啊！\n\n\n\n  你今晚再敢不回家，信不信我過來直接抽你！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒作勢揚起自己的巴掌，但她忽然發現自己面前的男子也就是自己的「姐夫」沒有像是往常一樣躲閃和求饒，反而那一雙眸子裡的意味，讓她感到有些害怕。\n\n\n\n  這時候，她看了看時間，發現已經七點半了。\n\n\n\n  「哼，我先上學去了，晚上再和你算帳！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒氣呼呼地走了。\n\n\n\n  周澤則是緩緩地坐回到了自己櫃檯後面的椅子上，這裡有一台老式筆記本，筆記本旁邊還有一部手機。\n\n\n\n  即使是現在，他依舊沒能從自己身份轉換的過程中適應過來。\n\n\n\n  他是周澤，是通城有名的年輕外科醫生，而且，他是一個孤兒，\n\n\n\n  結果，\n\n\n\n  自己眼下變成這個身份，\n\n\n\n  剛剛那個女孩兒說什麼來著？\n\n\n\n  我是……上門女婿？\n\n\n\n  有一個妻子？\n\n\n\n  還有丈母娘和丈人？\n\n\n\n  而且看自己這個小姨子剛剛自己這個「姐夫」面前說話的態度和語氣，自己這個「上門女婿」還真是符合古代的優良傳統。 \n\n\n\n  上門女婿，俗稱倒插門的，不光被妻子家裡人看不起，在古代也會被周遭所有人看不起，甚至身份和罪犯差不多，漢唐的時候那些被強迫戍邊的人裡面往往也有贅婿。\n\n\n\n  拿起手機，手機沒設置密碼，也不知道是那貨懶還是不敢設密碼，至少在這個時候讓周澤很輕鬆地打開了他的微信和QQ。\n\n\n\n  QQ列表里人很少，也就是些許初中同學，高中同學和大學同學，然後有一個家人的列表，裡面只有一個人，備註是「老婆」。\n\n\n\n  打開了和她的QQ聊天記錄，空。\n\n\n\n  好吧，\n\n\n\n  周澤打開了微信，試著找了一下，找到了備註是「老婆」的女人，這裡有回覆了，基本都是徐樂問一些事情，比如今晚吃什麼，今晚要準備做什麼，進貨需要花多少錢，最近書店賣了多少錢，你身體怎麼樣一大堆，\n\n\n\n  然後對方的回覆往往很敷衍也很高冷，\n\n\n\n  以：\n\n\n\n  「哦」\n\n\n\n  「嗯」\n\n\n\n  「好」\n\n\n\n  來代替。\n\n\n\n  周澤將手機丟一邊，這個人際關係，有點複雜了，他忽然看了一下自己的手掌，自己的指甲和常人沒什麼區別。\n\n\n\n  但自己出車禍前救治的那個老者，自己從無面女人手中脫困，自己進入這個傢伙身體等這些事情上，自己的指甲，起到了極為關鍵的作用。 \n\n\n\n  心隨意動，\n\n\n\n  就在這個時候，\n\n\n\n  周澤發現自己的指甲開始慢慢地變長，同時也變得漆黑通透起來，甚至在指甲上，還有淡淡的黑霧繚繞。\n\n\n\n  「呼…………」\n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  再睜開眼時，\n\n\n\n  指甲又恢復了正常。\n\n\n\n  一直從早上到中午，周澤都坐在那裡嘗試去適應自己的這個新身份，也在平復自己身份轉換所帶來的不適應感，中午飯都沒吃，也不知道是忘記了還是自己根本就不覺得餓。\n\n\n\n  這裡依舊還是通城，周澤以前的家在崇川區，現在則是在港閘區，距離並不遠。\n\n\n\n  到了下午時，周澤才嘆了口氣，默默地站起身，既來之則安之吧。\n\n\n\n  他開始試著打掃書架，總歸，給自己先找點事情做做。\n\n\n\n  那個死前掐過自己的老者曾說過「他被發現了」以及地獄裡無面女說過的「你遲早會被抓住」，讓周澤心裡產生了些許危機感。\n\n\n\n  他現在的狀態，算是「苟活」了，死而復生，是邀天之倖，所以他很珍惜，至少，在沒完全分清楚狀況和掌握足夠線索前，自己得代入這個身份，最好不要引起太大的異常，不要引起那些「要抓他的人」的注意。 \n\n\n\n  這家店的生意，真的很不好，傳統圖書市場的低迷，早就不是一天兩天的事兒了，而且這裡又不是在學校的大門口黃金一條街上。\n\n\n\n  只能說，那個「徐樂」選擇在這裡開一家書店，能不能保本都是一個問題。\n\n\n\n  一直到下午三點鐘的時候，才走進來今天的第一位客人。\n\n\n\n  客人在小學生讀物那邊轉悠著，且轉悠了很長時間。\n\n\n\n  周澤等了一會兒，還是走過去，問道：「選什麼題材的？」\n\n\n\n  雖然，周澤也不懂。\n\n\n\n  「隨便看看。」對方回答道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」周澤也就不再理會了，他現在還沒融入這個「書店老闆」的角色里。\n\n\n\n  但就在這時，\n\n\n\n  對方卻忽然走到了自己身後，幽幽地開口道：\n\n\n\n  「你真的不認識我了？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「昨晚我用棒球棒打了你的頭，搶了你的錢，\n\n\n\n  而且我還特意去試了一下，\n\n\n\n  你那時分明已經沒有鼻息了的。」",
