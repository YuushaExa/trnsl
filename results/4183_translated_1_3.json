    "content": "Zhou Ze cupped a handful of water and splashed it on his face. He slowly raised his head, looking at himself in the mirror, looking a bit haggard. As an emergency room doctor, this haggardness seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is coming soon. It seems like they fell from a building, not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called out from the men's restroom doorway.\n\n\"Got it, coming right away.\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out a tissue to wipe the water drops dry and started to walk out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. On the stretcher lay an elder dressed in a grey Tang suit. The elder was coughing incessantly, occasionally coughing up blood clots and fragments of splenic organs, and his entire body was covered in blood.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the injured person's condition, and at the same time shouted to the people in front, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe injured person's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe elder opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these words at such a time. Only a few can truly face death calmly. As doctors, this is not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell them their chances of survival. What the injured person needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... it's really too terrifying down there...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly grabbed Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Steady your emotions, relax, your life will be fine.\" Although his wrist was aching, Zhou Ze did not try to break free.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down again... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe elder's fingernails were long, and for some unknown reason, they were black, a translucent black similar to amber, not looking like dirt accumulated within them;\n\nAnd at this moment, the elder's fingernails had already dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly straightened up and coughed violently, then his body trembled, the hand that was gripping Zhou Ze's released, and he lost all movement.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe elder was wheeled into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitation measures, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me take care of your wound.\" Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they are not really worried about such minor skin injuries. What they are most concerned about is if the elder has other diseases, which could put the doctor in a dangerous situation of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the elder's hand, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant that the person could not be saved.\n\nEveryone's emotions were a bit down, but for them, such things were common, and they would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let's do a check-up.\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something else tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got into his car, and left.\n\nAs soon as the car drove under the elevated section of Jianghai Avenue, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient delayed me. I'm on my way now, please ask the children to wait a little longer for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other side quickly hung up the phone.\n\nZhou Ze checked the time again, it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed early.\n\nThe red light turned green, Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator and drove forward.\n\n\"Beep!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and drove towards him. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look out the car window at the blinding high beams,\n\nImmediately,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly hit and sent flying by the heavy truck. After tumbling several times in the air, it crashed to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up,\n\nHe found his body completely unable to move, as if stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional ethics, he wanted to check his injuries immediately, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he occasionally heard the sound of other vehicles passing by, and various horn sounds.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car sounded, and then the sound of a fire truck,\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance arrived, which Zhou Ze found comforting.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a bit high, indicating that his car was being cut to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his trunk and the Children's Day party for the orphanage children would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice called out.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered an unexpected disaster.\n\nThere were also a few nurses' voices nearby, but because of the surrounding noise, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, Doctor Chen's next sentence plunged Zhou Ze's heart into the abyss!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying voices of several nurses he knew,\n\nDoctor Chen punched the nearby car door, looking very distressed.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI should be in a state of suspended animation right now,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injury?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared madly in his heart.\n\nBut next, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher and then carried into an ambulance.\n\nThen came the sound of the ambulance driving.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded exceptionally harsh in Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy cry!\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leaders speaking:\n\n\"Xiao Zhou just... gone?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very severe. Doctor Zhou was severely injured and lost too much blood. He has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone?\" Another vice president still couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Xiao Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his leaders and elders,\n\nThey actually determined that he was dead,\n\nBut can a dead person still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nAnimals,\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move, the surroundings were quiet, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it, a person, just gone like that. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"The weather is unpredictable, and people have unforeseen misfortunes. Just try to accept it.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAround,\n\nEmpty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, trying to resist, he wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like sleep paralysis; no matter how much he tried, his body was completely out of his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair,\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted,\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nIn the hospital,\n\nMortuary.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and the stinging sensation was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" Someone asked from the side.\n\n\"Don't rush, wait a moment. He was hit and injured so badly, how could the makeup be done so quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital is rushing us, they need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Or you can do it.\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed, applying makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people, and dead people naturally wouldn't feel pain, nor would they worry about complaints. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle,\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush repeatedly pressing on his face,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. We're done with our work.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed into clothes, and then he was pushed out. Hospital orderlies carried him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be a coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly isolated,\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nWobbling,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown period, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The coffin lid must have been opened.\n\nWhat entered his ears,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe hospital director was speaking into a microphone, praising him, lamenting him,\n\nThen the vice director and the head of department, and so on.\n\nAround,\n\nHe occasionally heard footsteps passing by,\n\nSome people just quietly walked past, taking a last look at him,\n\nSome tried to call his name a few times, with a crying tone,\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe started trying to struggle again,\n\nBut still couldn't,\n\nHe could only hear and feel,\n\nBut couldn't speak,\n\nAnd couldn't open his eyes,\n\nEveryone thought he was dead,\n\nBut he knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying by his side.\n\nThey cried sincerely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who grew up in an orphanage, and because of this, after starting work, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. The car accident happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage that night to celebrate Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Xiao Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but your compensation will go to the orphanage, don't worry.\" The vice president said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again; the coffin lid must have been closed once more.\n\nThen another bout of bumping,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe coffin lid was opened again,\n\nAround, it was a bit quiet, occasionally hearing human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and one holding his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which seemed to be made of steel.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, there were faint sounds of crying.\n\nZhou Ze initially couldn't distinguish where he had arrived,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood,\n\nBastards!\n\nThey brought him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou beasts,\n\nMisfits!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThis time, it was Zhou Ze's most frantic and maddest attempt.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he was truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty, he hadn't started a family, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded beside him.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap across the mouth.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, I'll deal with you when we get home.\" The girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside could not perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of this, he was incredibly afraid!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for feeling sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being upset,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing on tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being pushed into a narrow place full of the smell of oil residue,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA sticky liquid sprayed onto his body,\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere..."
