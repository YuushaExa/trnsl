    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly lifted his head, looking at his reflection in the mirror, looking a bit haggard. As an emergency doctor, this haggardness was almost a standard feature.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is coming soon, seems to have fallen from a building, don't know if it's suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called out from the men's restroom doorway.\n\n\"Got it, coming right away.\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out a tissue, wiped the water droplets clean, and started to walk out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. On the stretcher lay an old man in a gray Tang suit. The old man was coughing incessantly, and from time to time, blood foam and fragments of internal organs were coughed out. His entire body was stained with blood.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition, and at the same time shouted to those ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you. You won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say such things at this time. Only a minority can calmly face death. And as a doctor, it's certainly not the time to analyze the illness with the patient or tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly gripped Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Calm yourself, relax. Your life will be fine.\" Although his wrist was hurting, Zhou Ze did not try to break free.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down again... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, they were black, a translucent black similar to amber, not like dirt was accumulated within them;\n\nAnd at this moment, the old man's fingernails had already dug into Zhou Ze's wrist flesh.\n\n\"I won't go down... won't go down... won't go down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly straightened up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, the hand gripping Zhou Ze slipped away, and he became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitative measures, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me treat your wound.\" Wang Ya came over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't really worried about this minor injury. Their biggest concern was the possibility of the old man having other diseases, which could put the doctor in a dangerous situation of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the old man's hands just now, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome illnesses, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person could not be saved.\n\nEveryone's spirits were a bit low, but for them, this kind of thing was already commonplace, and they would quickly adjust.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, please get a check-up.\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something else tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and drove away.\n\nAs soon as the car drove under the elevated section of Jianghai Avenue, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now. Please ask the children to wait for me a little longer.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright.\" The other end quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze checked the time again, it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk!\"\n\nAnd just then,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and drove over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look out the car window at the blinding high beams,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly sent flying by the heavy truck, rolling several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up,\n\nHe found his body completely immobile, as if it were stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he really wanted to check his injuries now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAll around, he occasionally heard the sound of other vehicles driving by, and various honking sounds.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nPolice sirens came, and the sound of fire trucks,\n\nFinally, the familiar sound of ambulance sirens reached Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a bit high; they were likely cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his back trunk and the Children's Day party for the orphanage kids would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice called out.\n\nIt must be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze sighed in relief. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered an unexpected disaster.\n\nThere were also voices of a few nurses nearby, but because it was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear clearly.\n\nBut then, Dr. Chen's next words made Zhou Ze's heart plummet!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has lost his vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze sensed someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression, yet he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the sound of several familiar nurses crying,\n\nDr. Chen punched the nearby car door, looking very distraught.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nPlease don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI should be in a state of suspended animation right now,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his heart.\n\nBut then, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher, likely being transported into an ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, he heard the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded particularly harsh to Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nWhy are they crying!\n\nWhy cry!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leaders speaking:\n\n\"Little Zhou is just gone?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very severe. Dr. Zhou was overly injured and suffered excessive blood loss. Death has been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone like that?\" Another deputy director still couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his leaders or elders,\n\nThey actually believed he was dead.\n\nBut could a dead person still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nYou mongrels,\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move. All around was quiet, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Suqin Jie, I just can't believe it, someone just gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"There's no telling what the day may bring. Just accept it.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAll around,\n\nEmpty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze struggled incessantly, constantly trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like sleep paralysis. No matter how hard he tried, his body simply wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair,\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted,\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nIn the hospital,\n\nMorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he sensed a faint coolness on his face, and a sharp stinging sensation was also clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" Someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, just wait. He's been hit so badly, how can the makeup be done so quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital is already rushing us, they need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Or you can do it.\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed, and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people, who naturally wouldn't feel pain or complain. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle,\n\nHe simply lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush pressing repeatedly on his face,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. We're done with our work.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed into clothes. Immediately after, he was pushed out, and the hospital orderlies lifted him into a soft, confined space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be a cold storage casket.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly cut off,\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown period, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the cold storage casket must have been opened.\n\nWhat entered his ears,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe director was speaking into a microphone, praising him, lamenting his loss,\n\nThen came the deputy director and the department head, and others.\n\nAround,\n\nFootsteps passed by from time to time,\n\nSome simply walked quietly, taking a last look at him,\n\nSome even tried to call out to him, with a choked voice,\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe began to try again,\n\nBut still couldn't,\n\nHe could only hear and feel,\n\nBut couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes,\n\nEveryone thought he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying by his side.\n\nThey cried sincerely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who grew up in an orphanage. As a result, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage that night to celebrate Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but your compensation will be given to the orphanage, don't worry.\" The deputy director stood by Zhou Ze and said.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again; the lid of the cold storage casket must have been closed once more.\n\nThen came another period of bumping,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the cold storage casket was opened again,\n\nAll around, it was a bit quiet; occasionally, human voices were heard, but not in a noisy way.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and one holding his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which seemed to be made of steel.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround, there was a faint, indistinct sound of crying.\n\nZhou Ze at first couldn't tell where he had arrived,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood,\n\nBastards!\n\nThey had sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou beasts,\n\nYou mongrels,\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was the most frantic, the most insane he had ever been,\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he truly was unwilling. He was not yet thirty, he hadn't married, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, I'll deal with you when we get home.\" The girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't sense it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was incredibly terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being upset,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing on tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed that he seemed to have been pushed into a narrow place filled with the smell of oil dregs,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA sticky liquid was sprayed onto his body,\n\nHe knew what this was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere..."

    "content": "Midnight streets,\n\nThe streetlights yellow,\nThe people frantic,\nThe weather cold, with a wind like a knife cutting at one's skin.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\nHe didn't know where he was,\nBut he knew one thing:\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe had died, but he had returned.\nHe didn't know what he should do,\nHe could only mechanically and numbly keep walking forward.\nHe didn't have the time to think about too many other things right now,\nSuch as the place he had just been,\nSuch as the old man he had saved before his car accident,\nSuch as the faceless woman in the pond wearing a red dress,\nSuch as... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyful thing, but even when people occasionally walked by, even if he tried his hardest to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\nHe was rejected and isolated by this world.\n\nThose who haven't experienced being put in \"solitary confinement\" won't understand the pain of complete isolation. And for Zhou Ze, the entire world was his cage, and the cage was covered with a black cloth.\n\nNo one could see him,\nNor could anyone communicate with him,\nHe couldn't pick up any solid object,\nEven,\nThe wind could easily blow right through him.\nHe was so frail,\nThe phrase \"weak against the wind\" was absolutely no exaggeration when applied to him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that\nHe could see faint specks of light constantly scattering from his body,\nIn other words,\nHis body was slowly fading.\nPerhaps in another quarter of an hour, he would completely disappear, every last insignificant trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this happened, but he knew that his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li entered the body of a starved, collapsed person in the form of a soul, which is how he became known in later legends.\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"possessing a body to return to life.\" He also wanted to possess a body to return to life. He was very cold and panicked. He needed a physical body to attach himself to.\nHe didn't even care whose body it was.\n\nAt times like these, people are always selfish, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he tried to approach someone, lights would appear above their head and on their shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even got hurt as a result, accelerating his \"evaporation.\"\n\nHe was a bit tired, and a bit numb,\nHe was waiting for his end,\nWaiting for his finish.\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him a bit more composed.\nFurthermore, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would suffer.\n\n\"Creak...\"\nAhead, there was a storefront still lit up. It seemed to be a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\nSomeone pushed the door open and came out. It was a man in a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his face wasn't clear. He looked left and right for a while, then hurried away.\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze, who was standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nInitially, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\nYes,\nA warm aura.\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel somewhat bewildered, but he was like a person on the verge of freezing to death who suddenly got a box of matches. Even knowing the matches wouldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last bit of warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body passing directly through the bookstore's glass door, continuing further inside, and arriving behind the bookshelves.\nBehind the bookshelves,\nLay a person,\nIt was a handsome young man, probably twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the store, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\nHe lay on the ground, but from him, Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling, like a pauper walking on the road at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\nThis attraction was irresistible, and at this moment, Zhou Ze had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of the young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to touch the warmth he needed.\nHe extended a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embed into the other person's body.\nThis was a very strange sensation, different from the \"breeze\" blowing through his body when he walked on the street earlier. This was a kind of merging, a fusion using his fingernails as a medium.\nSlowly, Zhou Ze himself began to enter the other person's body. The two began to overlap.\n\n..................\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was awakened by a series of shoves. No, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, where he had been resting his head on his hands.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\nThe woman's voice was sharp, high-pitched, and filled with an air of command.\n\nRaising his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, to be precise, it should be a girl, probably high school age. Although she was a big girl, she still had a bit of childishness about her.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what do you mean by this? You're getting bold, aren't you? Trying to give my parents and my sister attitude, aren't you? You actually dared not to come home all night!\nWho gave you such guts!\"\n\nXu Le?\nWho was that?\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion, finding them smooth. His previous hands had some calluses from long hours of practicing surgical instruments, but these hands did not.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\nThe girl slammed a hand on the counter, full of aggression.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the store door. He saw his reflection, an unfamiliar face. No, he had seen this face before, it was the face he saw last night.\nThis body,\nIs mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are angry, my mom is even throwing a fit at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now belongs to my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\nWho are you trying to put on a show for?!\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe it or not, I'll come over and smack you!\"\n\nThe girl made to raise her hand, but she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg as usual. Instead, the meaning in his eyes made her feel somewhat afraid.\nAt this point, she checked the time and realized it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school now, I'll settle with you tonight!\"\nThe girl stomped off, fuming.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and next to it, a mobile phone.\nEven now, he still hadn't adapted to his identity change.\nHe was Zhou Ze, a renowned young surgeon from Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\nNow,\nHe had become this person.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nHe was... a live-in son-in-law?\nHad a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" when speaking to her \"brother-in-law\" just now, this \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient traditions.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-to-door son-in-law,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even similar to criminals; during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced into border garrisons often included赘婿 (a man who marries into his wife's family and lives with them).\n\nHe picked up the phone. It wasn't password-protected, whether out of laziness or fear, but it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open its WeChat and QQ.\nThe QQ contact list was sparse, just a few junior high, high school, and college classmates, and then a family list with only one person, labeled \"Wife.\"\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her, it was empty.\nAlright,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat, tried searching, and found the woman labeled \"Wife.\" There were replies here, mostly Xu Le asking about things like what to eat tonight, what to prepare tonight, how much money was needed for stock, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how his health was, and a whole lot more.\nThe other person's replies were often perfunctory and aloof,\nLike:\n\"Oh\"\n\"Hmm\"\n\"Okay\"\nTo replace longer answers.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This social dynamic was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm. His fingernails were no different from anyone else's.\nHowever, in the events leading up to his car accident—saving the old man, escaping from the faceless woman, entering this guy's body—his fingernails had played a crucial role.\n\nWith a thought,\nAt that moment,\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly growing longer, simultaneously becoming pitch-black and translucent. There was even a faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n\"Whew...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nClosed his eyes,\nAnd when he opened them again,\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort caused by the change. He didn't even eat lunch, whether he forgot or simply didn't feel hungry.\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's former home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District, which wasn't far.\n\nBy the afternoon, Zhou Ze sighed, slowly stood up, and decided to make the best of it.\nHe started trying to clean the bookshelves, at least to give himself something to do.\nThe old man who had choked him before he died had said \"he's been found,\" and the faceless woman in the underworld had said \"you'll be caught sooner or later,\" which created a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nHis current state was \"barely surviving.\" To die and be resurrected was an act of divine grace, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to embrace this identity. It was best not to cause too much abnormality, not to attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business at this shop was truly terrible. The slump in the traditional book market hadn't been a one or two-day affair, and this location wasn't on the prime commercial street at the entrance of a school.\nOne could only say that \"Xu Le's\" choice to open a bookstore here made it questionable whether he could even break even.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\nThe customer browsed in the children's books section for a long time.\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What kind of genre are you looking for?\"\nAlthough Zhou Ze himself didn't know much about it.\n\n\"Just looking around,\" the other person replied.\n\"Hmm.\" Zhou Ze didn't bother him anymore. He hadn't fully immersed himself in the role of \"bookstore owner\" yet.\n\nBut just then,\nThe other person suddenly walked behind him and said eerily,\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and robbed you of your money.\nAnd I even specifically checked,\nYou clearly had no breath left then.\""
