    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water, Zhou Ze splashed it on his face, then slowly raised his head, looking at his reflection in the mirror. He looked a bit haggard; as an emergency room doctor, this haggardness seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is coming soon. Looks like they fell from a building, not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called from the entrance to the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, be right there.\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out some tissues to dry his face and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. On the stretcher lay an old man in a gray Tang suit. The old man was coughing incessantly, occasionally coughing up bloody foam and fragments of internal organs, his entire body covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition, and at the same time shouted to the person in front: \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man opened his eyes and looked at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We will help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these kinds of words at such a time. Only a minority can truly face death calmly. As a doctor, this is certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition or tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Steady your emotions, relax. Your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist felt a bit sore, Zhou Ze did not try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down again... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" the young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, they were black, a translucent black, like amber, not appearing to have dirt accumulated within them;\n\nAnd now, the old man's fingernails had already embedded themselves into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... hahaha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly straightened up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, and the hand that had been gripping Zhou Ze's fell away. He became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitative measures, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me treat your wound.\" Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't really worried about this minor scratch. What they worried about most was if the old man had other illnesses, which could put the doctor in a dangerous situation of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the old man's hand just now, and no one knew if he had any contagious diseases.\n\nSome illnesses, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone's spirits were a bit low, but for them, such incidents were commonplace, and they would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let's get you checked out.\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something else tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and drove away.\n\nAs soon as the car drove under the elevated section of Jianghai Avenue, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now. Please ask the children to wait a little longer for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other side quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze checked the time again; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze pressed the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"BEEP!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAnd just then,\n\nA heavy truck ran the red light and came rushing towards him. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head to look out the window at the blinding high beams,\n\nThen,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly flung into the air by the heavy truck, tumbling several times before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up,\n\nHe found his body completely unable to move, as if it was stuck.\n\nAt the same time, he couldn't open his eyes. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he really wanted to check his injuries now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAll around, he occasionally heard the sound of other vehicles passing by, and various horn blares.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car sounded, and then the sound of a fire truck,\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance reached Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a bit high; they must be cutting his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his back seat, and the Children's Day party for the orphanage kids, would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice called out.\n\nIt must be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled slowly in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered a sudden, unexpected disaster.\n\nThere were also voices of a few nurses nearby, but Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly because of the surrounding noise.\n\nBut then, Dr. Chen's next words plunged Zhou Ze's heart into a valley!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he still had consciousness, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze sensed someone performing CPR on him. He felt the heavy compressions, each one, but he couldn't open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying of a few nurses he knew,\n\nDr. Chen punched the nearby car door, looking very distressed.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI should be in a state of suspended animation right now,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared frantically in his mind.\n\nBut then, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher, likely being put into an ambulance.\n\nFollowing that, the sound of the ambulance driving.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded particularly harsh to Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet,\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the hospital director speaking:\n\n\"Little Zhou is just... gone?\"\n\n\"The accident was very serious. Dr. Zhou was severely injured, with excessive blood loss, and has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone?\" Another vice director still couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his superiors or elders,\n\nThey actually determined that he was dead,\n\nBut can a dead person still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nYou monsters,\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move. The surroundings were quiet, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Suqin Jie, I just can't believe it, someone just gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"There's no telling what the future holds for anyone; just try to see past it.\"¹\n\nAfter the two nurses finished speaking, they left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nIt was so clear.\n\nZhou Ze struggled incessantly, trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like sleep paralysis; no matter how hard he tried, his body simply wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in some despair,\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted,\n\nHe knew where he was now,\n\nAt the hospital,\n\nThe morgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and the stinging sensation was very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done yet?\" Someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, just a moment. He was hit so badly, how could the makeup be done so quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital is urging us; they're about to send him to the memorial service.\"\n\n\"Then you do it.\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit angry, applying makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people; dead people wouldn't complain of pain, and there was no need to worry about complaints. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle,\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush constantly pressing on his face,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. We're done with our work.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed, and then he was pushed out. The hospital orderlies lifted him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nMust be a cold storage coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly cut off,\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nSwaying,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the cold storage coffin must have been opened.\n\nWhat he heard,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe director was speaking into a microphone, praising him, lamenting his loss,\n\nThen the vice director and department head spoke, and so on.\n\nAround him,\n\nFootsteps occasionally passed by,\n\nSome people just walked by silently, taking a last look at him,\n\nSome tried to call out to him, their voices choked with sobs,\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nThe viewing,\n\nOf my remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart,\n\nHe began to try again,\n\nBut still couldn't,\n\nHe could only hear, and feel,\n\nBut he couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes,\n\nEveryone assumed he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying by his side.\n\nThey cried genuinely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who came out of an orphanage. Because of this, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage that night to celebrate Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation to the orphanage, don't worry.\" The vice director said, standing by Zhou Ze's side.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again; the lid of the cold storage coffin must have been closed again.\n\nThen there was another bout of jostling,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the cold storage coffin was opened again,\n\nAround him, it was somewhat quiet, occasionally hearing human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and one holding his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which seemed to be made of steel.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, faint sobs were vaguely heard.\n\nZhou Ze initially hadn't distinguished where he had arrived again,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood,\n\nYou bastards!\n\nThey brought him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou beasts,\n\nYou mongrels!\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was the most frantic he had ever been, and the most desperate,\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty, he hadn't married, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long road ahead of him!\n\n\"Mama, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small smack to her mouth.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get home.\" The girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't sense it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was incredibly afraid!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his pleas,\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being grief-stricken,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing on tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being pushed into a narrow place full of the smell of oil residue,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA viscous liquid sprayed onto his body,\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere...\n\n¹ TLN: This is a common Chinese idiom, meaning that unexpected good or bad things can happen at any time."

    "content": "On the midnight street,\n\nThe streetlights glowed yellow,\nAnd people were terrified.\nThe weather was cold, with a wind that cut like a knife.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\nHe didn't know where he was again,\nBut he knew one thing:\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe had died, but he had returned.\nHe didn't know what to do,\nSo he just continued to walk forward mechanically and numbly.\nHe didn't have the time to think about too many other things right now,\nSuch as the place he had just descended to,\nSuch as the old man he had saved before his car accident,\nSuch as the faceless woman in the red dress in the pond,\nSuch as... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyful thing, but even when someone occasionally walked by him, even when he tried to greet them with all his might, no one could see or hear him.\nHe had been ostracized, isolated by this world.\n\nThose who have never experienced being put in \"solitary confinement\" won't understand the pain of complete isolation. For Zhou Ze, the entire world was now his cage, and a black cloth had been draped over it.\n\nNo one could see him.\nNo one could communicate with him.\nHe couldn't pick up anything tangible.\nIn fact,\nEven the wind could easily blow through him.\n\nHe was so frail.\nThe phrase \"too weak to withstand a gust of wind\" was truly not an exaggeration for him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that\nHe could see faint specks of light constantly scattering from his body.\nIn other words,\nHis body was slowly fading.\nPerhaps in another quarter of an hour, he would completely disappear, the last trace of his insignificant existence erased.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this happened, but he knew that his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li entered the body of a starving man who had collapsed and died through his soul, thus becoming the image passed down through generations.\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return a soul.\" He wanted to borrow a corpse to return his soul. He was very cold and panicked. He needed a physical body to attach himself to.\nHe didn't even care whose body it was.\nAt times like these, people are always selfish, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Furthermore, he truly couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he tried to approach someone, lights would appear above their head and shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even got hurt as a result, accelerating his \"evaporation\" speed.\n\nHe was a little tired, a little numb.\nHe was waiting for his end,\nWaiting for his finish.\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him more at peace.\nMoreover, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would endure torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a shop still lit up, which seemed to be a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\nSomeone pushed the door open and came out. It was a man wearing a hoodie and a hat, so his face wasn't clear. He looked around for a bit and then left in a hurry.\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly perceived a warm sensation from inside the bookstore.\nYes,\nA warm sensation.\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel somewhat inexplicable, but he was like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly found a box of matches. Even if he knew the matches wouldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last bit of warmth before he died.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body passing directly through the bookstore's glass door. He continued to walk inside, reaching behind the bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\nLay a person.\nIt was a handsome young man, probably around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the store, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\nHe lay on the ground, but Zhou Ze felt a sense of warmth from him, like a pauper walking down the road at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\nThis attraction was irresistible, and at this moment, Zhou Ze wasn't in a position to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of the young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to touch the warmth he needed.\nHe extended a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embedding into the other person's body.\nThis was a very strange feeling, different from the \"breeze\" blowing through his body when he was walking on the road earlier. This was a fusion, a merging with his fingernails as the medium.\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other person's body. The two began to overlap.\n\n..................\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was awakened by a series of shoves. No, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, where he had been resting his hands.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, carrying a tone of command.\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the woman in front of him. No, more accurately, she should be a girl, probably high-school age. Though she was a big girl, she still had a touch of childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what do you mean by this? You're getting bold, aren't you? You want to disrespect my parents and my sister, huh? You actually didn't come home all night last night!\nWho gave you the nerve?!\"\n\nXu Le?\nWho is that?\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion, finding them very smooth. His old hands had developed calluses from prolonged practice with surgical instruments, but these hands did not.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slapped the counter, full of aggression.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection: a strange face. No, he had seen this face before, the one he saw last night.\nThis body,\nIs it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are both angry. My mom is throwing a fit at home! I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use comes from my family. What right do you, the live-in son-in-law, have to act so important in my house?\nWho are you trying to impress?!\nIf you dare not come home tonight, I swear I'll come over and smack you!\"\n\nThe girl made a gesture to raise her hand, but then she suddenly noticed that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" wasn't dodging or begging as usual. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\nAt this moment, she checked the time and realized it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school now. I'll settle this with you tonight!\"\n\nThe girl left in a huff.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a cell phone next to it.\nEven now, he still hadn't adapted to the change in his identity.\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\nNow,\nHe had transformed into this identity.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nI'm... a live-in son-in-law?\nDo I have a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" just now towards her \"brother-in-law,\" this \"live-in son-in-law\" truly fit the traditional mold of ancient times.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-to-door son-in-law,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was almost like that of criminals. During the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced into border service often included live-in sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up the phone. It wasn't password protected, perhaps because the original owner was lazy or didn't dare set one. At least, this made it easy for Zhou Ze to open his WeChat and QQ.\nThere were very few people on the QQ list, just a few junior high, high school, and college classmates. Then there was a family list with only one person, labeled \"Wife.\"\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her, and it was empty.\n\nOkay.\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to search, finding the woman labeled \"Wife.\" There were replies here, mostly Xu Le asking about things like what to eat tonight, what needed to be prepared tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how her health was—a whole bunch of questions.\nThe other person's replies were often perfunctory and cold,\nUsing:\n\"Oh\"\n\"Hm\"\n\"Okay\"\nto respond.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This social relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm. His fingernails were no different from a normal person's.\nBut in the events leading up to his car accident, saving that old man, escaping from the faceless woman, and entering this guy's body—his fingernails played an extremely crucial role.\n\nWith a thought,\nJust then,\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly begin to lengthen and become dark and translucent. Faint black mist even swirled around them.\n\n\"Whew...\"\n\nHe exhaled deeply,\nClosed his eyes,\nAnd when he opened them again,\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort caused by the identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, whether he forgot or simply didn't feel hungry.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze sighed and silently stood up. Since he was here, he might as well make the best of it.\nHe began to try cleaning the bookshelves. At least, he needed to find something to do.\n\nThe old man who had choked him before he died had said \"he was found,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said \"you will be caught sooner or later,\" which created a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze's heart.\nHis current state was considered \"barely surviving.\" Dying and coming back to life was an incredible stroke of luck, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to assume this identity and try not to cause too much abnormality or attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this shop was truly terrible. The slump in the traditional book market had not been a one or two-day affair, and this place wasn't on the golden strip right outside a school.\nOne could only say that whether \"Xu Le\" choosing to open a bookstore here could even break even was a question.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\nThe customer browsed the children's books section for a very long time.\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What kind of genre are you looking for?\"\nAlthough Zhou Ze didn't understand either.\n\"Just looking around,\" the other person replied.\n\"Hm.\" Zhou Ze didn't bother with him anymore. He hadn't yet settled into his role as \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut just then,\nThe other person suddenly walked behind him and said eerily,\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and robbed you of your money.\nAnd I even specifically checked,\nYou clearly weren't breathing then.\""
