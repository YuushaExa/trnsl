    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water, Zhou Ze splashed it on his face. He slowly raised his head and looked at himself in the mirror. He looked a bit haggard; for an ER doctor, this kind of haggardness was almost a standard feature.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is on the way! Seems like he fell from upstairs, not sure if it was a suicide attempt!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the entrance of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there,\" Zhou Ze called back. He pulled out a paper towel, wiped the water from his face, and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance soon pulled into the hospital. On the gurney lay an old man in a gray Tang suit. The man was coughing nonstop, occasionally spitting up bloody foam and what looked like fragments of his spleen. His entire body was covered in blood.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the gurney while observing the patient's condition, and shouted to the people ahead, \"Prep the surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was critical.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, fixed on Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you're going to be okay. We'll help you. You're not going to die.\"\n\nMost dying patients said things like this. After all, few people could truly face death with calm. As a doctor, this wasn't the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell him his odds of survival. What the patient needed right now was psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down below... down below... It's terrifying down below...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, his face grim as he stared at him.\n\n\"You need to calm your emotions. Relax. Your life is not in danger.\" Although his wrist throbbed with a raw pain, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go back down... They... they found me... I... They found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a piercing pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" a young nurse beside him cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were long, and for some unknown reason, they were black—a translucent, amber-like black, not the kind caused by an accumulation of dirt.\n\nAnd right now, the old man's nails had dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going back down... not going back down... not going down... haha... *cough cough cough*...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat bolt upright, coughing violently. Then, his body shuddered. The hand gripping Zhou Ze's wrist went slack, and he fell still.\n\n\"Prepare to resuscitate!\" Zhou Ze yelled.\n\nThe old man was rushed into the emergency room, where doctors and nurses began resuscitation procedures. The defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me take care of that wound for you,\" Wang Ya said, walking over.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about a small flesh wound. Their biggest fear was that the old man might have other diseases, potentially putting them at risk of occupational exposure. After all, the old man's hands had just been covered in a lot of blood, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, once contracted, could ruin your entire life.\n\nJust after the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nIt meant the man couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone's spirits sank, but for them, this was a common occurrence. They would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, you should get tested,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the locker room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and left.\n\nJust as he drove under the Jianghai Avenue overpass, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now. Please ask the children to wait just a little longer for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The person on the other end quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green. Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator and drove forward.\n\n\"BEEEEEEEP!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAt that very moment, a heavy truck ran a red light and came straight at him. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and see the blinding high beams in his window.\n\nThen,\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nThe world spun.\n\nIn front of the heavy truck, the small car was like a fragile piece of paper, sent flying. It flipped several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze regained consciousness.\n\nHe found he couldn't move his body at all, as if he were pinned.\n\nAt the same time, he couldn't open his eyes. He knew he had been in a car crash, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he desperately wanted to check his injuries, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he could hear the sound of other cars driving by, and various horns honking.\n\n*Am I still at the crash scene?*\n\n*Am I still in the car?*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon, the sound of police sirens arrived, followed by the sound of a fire truck.\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance reached him.\n\nZhou Ze could feel his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a little high; they must be cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations; he was familiar with the procedures.\n\nWhat a shame. The cake in his trunk, and the June 1st Children's Day party for the orphanage kids, would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze breathed a long sigh of relief in his mind. At least he had survived. This could be chalked up to a freak accident.\n\nHe could hear the voices of a few nurses nearby, but it was too noisy, so he couldn't make them out clearly.\n\nBut what Doctor Chen said next made Zhou Ze's heart sink to the bottom of a pit!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has no vital signs.\"\n\n*No.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*I'm not dead!!*\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his mind.\n\nHe wasn't dead. He was still conscious. He wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He could feel those heavy compressions, one after another, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity, Zhou Ze heard the sound of several nurses he knew crying.\n\nDoctor Chen slammed his fist on a nearby car door, clearly grief-stricken.\n\n*Hey!*\n\n*Don't give up!*\n\n*Please don't give up!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I must be in a state of apparent death.*\n\n*Massive blood loss?*\n\n*Severe injuries?*\n\n*But I'm really not dead!*\n\n*I should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!*\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his mind.\n\nBut next, he felt himself being lifted onto a gurney, likely being put into an ambulance.\n\nThen came the sound of the ambulance driving off.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut to Zhou Ze's ears, their crying was exceptionally grating.\n\nHe wasn't dead yet.\n\nWhat were they crying for!\n\nWhy were they crying!\n\n*Look at me again.*\n\n*Look at me again.*\n\n*Check me one more time.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\nThe ambulance came to a stop.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the voice of a hospital administrator: \"Little Zhou is just... gone like that?\"\n\n\"The crash was severe. Doctor Zhou was too badly injured, too much blood loss. Death has been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone?\" Another Vice Director couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked him again myself.\"\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You incompetent hacks!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bastards!*\n\n*Bastards!*\n\nZhou Ze cursed them endlessly in his mind. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, no longer his friends, and certainly not his superiors and elders.\n\nThey had actually declared him dead.\n\nBut could a dead person still hear voices and have sensations?\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You pack of bastards.*\n\n*Animals.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\nThe gurney began to move. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be so sad. The Director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it. A person, just gone like that. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"The heavens are unpredictable, and fortune can turn in an instant. ¹ You have to try to accept it.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAll around, it was empty.\n\nThat bone-chilling cold was so distinct.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, kept trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current state felt like sleep paralysis; no matter how hard he tried, his body was completely out of his control.\n\nFinally, he gave up in despair.\n\nHe was tired, exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now.\n\nIn the hospital's morgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, it was to a faint, cool sensation on his face. The stinging pain was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done yet?\" someone asked from the side.\n\n\"Don't rush me. Hold on. He was mangled this badly in the crash, how can the makeup be done so quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital people are rushing us. They need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it, then.\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, her clients were dead people. The dead naturally wouldn't complain about the pain, nor did she have to worry about receiving a complaint. She just needed to produce a result for the living to see.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly, enduring the stinging pain of the makeup brush pressing down on his face again and again.\n\nFinally, the makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, you can tell them to come in. We're done here.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt his clothes being changed. Then, he was pushed out. Hospital orderlies lifted him and placed him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis... must be an ice casket.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was cut off in an instant.\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking, swaying, bumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the ice casket must have been opened.\n\nWhat he heard was a dirge.\n\nThe Director was at a microphone, giving a speech. He was praising him, lamenting his loss.\n\nThen came the Vice Director, the department heads, and so on.\n\nAround him, he could hear the occasional sound of footsteps passing by.\n\nSome people just walked past quietly, taking one last look at him.\n\nSome people even tried to call his name a few times, their voices choked with tears.\n\nThis was the viewing of the body.\n\nA viewing... of *my* body!\n\n*I'm not dead.*\n\n*I'm really not dead.*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his mind.\n\nHe started to struggle again, but it was still no use.\n\nHe could only hear and feel. He couldn't speak, and he couldn't open his eyes.\n\nEveryone was certain he was dead.\n\nBut he himself knew, he wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage came, crying by his side.\n\nTheir tears were sincere. Zhou Ze himself had grown up in an orphanage, which was why after he started working, he donated most of his salary to it. This car crash had happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage at night to celebrate June 1st Children's Day with the kids.\n\n\"Xiao Zhou, you can go in peace. This time, it can be considered a work-related incident. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation money to the orphanage. Don't you worry,\" the Vice Director said, standing beside him.\n\nAfterward, Zhou Ze felt himself being closed off again. The lid of the ice casket must have been shut once more.\n\nThen another series of bumps, and finally, a stop.\n\nThe lid of the ice casket was opened again.\n\nIt was quiet all around, with occasional human voices that weren't loud.\n\nTwo people, one grabbing his shoulders and the other his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold platform, like a steel plate.\n\nThese two were practiced, very, very practiced.\n\nIn the distance, there were faint sounds of crying.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't figure out where he had been brought this time.\n\nBut in that moment, he suddenly understood.\n\n*You sons of bitches!*\n\n*They've sent me to the crematorium!*\n\n*They're going to burn me!*\n\n*I'm not dead, you sons of bitches!*\n\n*Fuck you and your ancestors!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*Don't cremate me.*\n\n*Don't cremate me!*\n\n*I'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*\n\n*You pack of animals.*\n\n*You bastards!*\n\n*You sons of bitches!!!!!*\n\nThis was Zhou Ze at his most frantic, his most crazed.\n\nHe knew that once he was cremated, there would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling to accept it. He truly was. He wasn't even thirty yet. He hadn't started a family. He didn't have any children. He still had a life, a long road ahead of him!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw that uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice piped up nearby.\n\n*Smack!* A sharp slap landed on her face.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nBecause no matter how he struggled, no matter how he roared in his mind, the people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started up.\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face, and because of that, he was terrified beyond measure!\n\n*No.*\n\n*No.*\n\n*No!*\n\n*I'm not dead, I'm really not dead!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\nNo one could hear his cries.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad.\n\nOnly responsible for grieving.\n\nOnly responsible for seeing this process through.\n\nThen they would go home, eat dinner, and carry on with their lives tomorrow.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze felt himself being pushed into a narrow space that reeked of greasy residue.\n\nThen, a sticky liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what it was.\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nAnd then,\n\n*Sizzle...*\n\nHot!\n\nSo hot!\n\nPain.\n\nIntense, burning pain!\n\nFire.\n\nFire.\n\nA huge fire.\n\nFire everywhere...\n\n***\n\n**Footnote:**\n\n[1] `天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福` (tiān yǒu bùcè fēngyún, rén yǒu dànxī huòfú) is a famous Chinese proverb. It literally translates to, \"The sky has unpredictable winds and clouds; a person has fortunes and misfortunes from dawn to dusk,\" meaning that life is unpredictable and tragedy can strike at any moment.",

    "content": "cold,\n\n\n\nSo cold...\n\n\n\nZhou Ze didn't know why it was so cold here.\n\n\n\nHe walked on a secluded path. On both sides of the path, he was filled with flowers, without any romantic and beautiful atmosphere. The flowers were full of laughter, like ridicule, or like a spectator.\n\n\n\nFlowers open to the other shore, and people go to rebirth;\n\n\n\nZhou Cheng remembered that his last memory was fire, fire, and the terrifying flames completely swallowed himself, and the heart-pounding heat temperature baked himself into ashes\n\n\n\nBut in the eyes,\n\n\n\nHe came here\n\n\n\nThere are actually many people on this road.\n\n\n\nThere is an old man,\n\n\n\nHave children,\n\n\n\nThere are also young and middle-aged people.\n\n\n\nThere are men and women,\n\n\n\nEveryone wears different clothes\n\n\n\nSome people wear very simple clothes, some people wear big and purple clothes, with overly divided cheeks on their faces\n\n\n\nEveryone was walking on tiptoe,\n\n\n\nNo one said anything,\n\n\n\nNo one made any other sounds.\n\n\n\nOnly the occasional \"scrub\" sole friction sound left\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was also walking numbly with everyone. He was constantly looking back and looking back, and he realized where he had come.\n\n\n\nHe is already dead;\n\n\n\nAnd here,\n\n\n\nIt's a landlord\n\n\n\nHere is the world of the dead and the fate of the dead.\n\n\n\n  Own,\n\n\n\nFinally, I'm still dead\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what to do, nor did he know what choice he should make.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't want to die, and people don't want to die, but in this place, he has no idea what to do. He is confused and helpless\n\n\n\n\"Yaah……………………………………………………………………”\n\n\n\nThe cool little tunes are transmitted from afar.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze glanced over and saw the red flowers coming from afar, while others around him were all familiar with it. He continued to tiptoe his feet and walked forward.\n\n\n\nAfter getting closer, Zhou Ze saw clearly that the flowers were peach blossom papers. Along the way, there was a group of women, standing in a team, holding the papers, and walking gracefully\n\n\n\nThey are tall and have a stylish body. They are all wearing purple cheongsams and walking. The flesh color of their thighs is constantly exposed. The confusing charm makes people palpitations.\n\n\n\nWomen wear hair buns, meticulous, and even their steps are neat, as if they are the most outstanding singing and dancing groups in the world. Moreover, they have been practicing for more than a hundred years.\n\n\n\nThey are walking,\n\n\n\nThey are moving forward,\n\n\n\nFrom one end of the little one to the other,\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\nPassed in front of Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nElaborate makeup, snow-white skin, and the cool and cold tuning that made me hummed create an old Shanghai atmosphere with a hazy rain.Every woman wears a bell on her wrist, which is of different colors and sizes. She holds her snow-white wrists, which is even more dazzling.\n\n\n\n  pity,\n\n\n\nThey are not walking in the commercial pedestrian area of South Street.\n\n\n\nIt is not the golden and brilliant high-end clubhouse,\n\n\n\nThey stepped on the Huangquan Road,\n\n\n\nWhat is plundering is the sea of flowers on the other side.\n\n\n\nThey were blindly obedient, the latter stared at the former,\n\n\n\nThe former,\n\n\n\n  The eyes are empty\n\n\n\nWhen the last woman passed by Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nThe woman suddenly turned her head and looked at Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nThe world is the most beautiful.\n\n\n\n  now,\n\n\n\nJump directly to another extreme\n\n\n\n  fear\n\n\n\nOf course it's terrifying\n\n\n\n  Nausea\n\n\n\nOf course I feel disgusted\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze is already a dead person, and people will be scared to death, but what about ghosts\n\n\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at the woman.\n\n\n\nThe two have short eyes and a little intertwined. Then, the woman continued to walk forward, her figure was swaying, and her back was circling, and the tightness of the cheongsam outlined her beautiful figure very vividly.\n\n\n\n\"Where are you... going?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously followed the woman forward, and then left the original team.\n\n\n\nAnd the little boy murmured the walking people,\n\n\n\nThere was no one looking here, they seemed to be unable to think or perceive, and Zhou Ze seemed to be the difference among them.\n\n\n\nA group of women, smoking step by step, kept walking forward, murmuring, as if purity was like ice;\n\n\n\nThe originally suppressed environment makes people feel more reckless because of their appearance.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk forward, and he followed them\n\n\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw them walking into the pool in front one by one.\n\n\n\nThe pool is not big.\n\n\n\nLike a lens,\n\n\n\nTheir entry seemed to break this silence and blow a layer of ripples\n\n\n\nThe women in the front were no longer in the water, and the women behind were also following.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked to the pool. He did not go down with him, he just stood on the side and watched.\n\n\n\nEverything here is a place that is absolutely unfamiliar to him. Anyone, a single child, only has one chance to come in, and after entering, he can't go out again.\n\n\n\nSomething floated out in the middle of the pond water.\n\n\n\nIt's a double handed,\n\n\n\n  A red hands are white,\n\n\n\n  Detailed green pills,\n\n\n\nThe two hands danced gracefully, like a dream, making people's eyes instantly attracted to it and could no longer move.\n\n\n\nBeauty is attractive, and this kind of beauty is fascinating\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly showed an intoxicated look in his eyes, and he couldn't help but start moving forward without even knowing thatFirst, the foot,\n\n\n\nThe tightness followed by the knees,\n\n\n\nNext to the waist,\n\n\n\nIn the end,\n\n\n\nThe water surface is not in the neck.\n\n\n\nEven the whole person entered the pond\n\n\n\nThe water in the pond is not cold, it is even very warm, the water surface is clear, and it is very visible. When you enter here, you will feel no pain of suffocation.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw the women who were holding paper in the previous team. They were moving under the water, and they continued to move forward.\n\n\n\nAnd the closest location to you,\n\n\n\nThere is a woman in red clothes. She is standing under the water, but her hands are dancing on the water surface.\n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\nNot because of beauty,\n\n\n\nIt is not because of other false influences.\n\n\n\nBut because this woman seems to have an indecipherable magic that makes you approach, get close, and make you unable to help yourself.\n\n\n\n  finally,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze approached her.\n\n\n\nAnd her hands slowly closed off the water\n\n\n\nThe woman has long and dense hair, and she is dancing in the waves, making it difficult for people to see her face clearly\n\n\n\n\"Finally... wait for someone like this again...\"\n\n\n\nThe woman's voice is crisp, sweet and glutinous.\n\n\n\nCharming heart\n\n\n\nThe woman's beautiful hands stretched out and put them on Zhou Ze's shoulder. This action was very affectionate\n\n\n\n\"You... come and accompany me...\"\n\n\n\nNext moment,\n\n\n\nThe woman's hair began to scatter, and the long green silk began to blow around the face;\n\n\n\nThe beauty brushed her face, which seemed to be a very emotional thing, but then the woman's hair turned into the most imperfect steel cable in the world, and began to tie up her neck.\n\n\n\n\"You come and accompany me...\"\n\n\n\nThe hair is loose and no longer covered.\n\n\n\nThe woman's face finally appeared.\n\n\n\nShe has no face.\n\n\n\nHer face is flat, without any wavy, and without pleats. This is a very smooth face, enough to make thousands of girls jealous and admiration.\n\n\n\nBut she has no nose, no mouth, no eyes, and no ears.\n\n\n\nFaceless...female\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt that he could not breathe, and his chest was about to explode. At the same time, his body seemed to be about to collapse.\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman's smile is still crisp and empty, but at this time, Zhou Ze's ears are like magical sounds.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze has come to sober.\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what it meant to be scattered in this way in this place.\n\n\n\nBut in short,\n\n\n\nIt won't be a good ending\n\n\n\n\"You are here... accompanying me...\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl continued to smile and her hair dancedZhou Ze subconsciously reached out his hand to grab the hair that was lying on his neck. He wanted to try hard to remove it.\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl felt very interesting about his overestimating her abilities.\n\n\n\n\"If you can't kill, don't slap it. Those who can walk here are spirits, and those with spirits. If I swallow them, I will have the chance to go back.\n\n\n\nYou make a reservation,\n\n\n\nWill become,\n\n\n\nMy offerings”\n\n\n\nBut just as the voice just fell,\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman exclaimed: \"How is it possible... impossible...\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's ten-finger nails began to grow slowly, with a dark and transparent color. In this pool, the strange light belonging to it was flashing. The color of this nail was exactly the same as the nail color of the old man who Zhou Ze treated before his death.\n\n\n\n\"Sizzy......izzy......\"\n\n\n\nThe sound of the hot water oil kettle is transmitted,\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman's hair was furious and melted and collapsed when she touched Zhou Ze's nails, while Zhou Ze's figure began to slowly retreat and began to remove the faceless woman's thigh.\n\n\n\n\"Impossible...Impossible...This is impossible...Why can you leave too\n\n\n\nWhy can you leave me too?\n\n\n\n  Why\n\n\n\n  Why\n\n\n\nThis is unfair\n\n\n\nUnfair”\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman used her hands to hold Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nBut when Zhou Ze used his hands to remove the nails, once his nails touched the faceless hand, the faceless girl's originally perfect and flawless jade hand was burned out.\n\n\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman screamed,\n\n\n\nThe body began to retreat, and since then, he has lost control of Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's body began to float up.\n\n\n\n Absent from the surface\n\n\n\n\"You can't escape...you will be...you will be caught back\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n\n\nIt is the fate of the deceased\n\n\n\nYou, you and them, even if they leave, will eventually be caught back.\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman shouted and roared hysterically below.\n\n\n\nShe was jealous,\n\n\n\nShe admires it,\n\n\n\nShe was crazy\n\n\n\nAnd the rising circumstance,\n\n\n\nAnd I slowly lost my own consciousness,\n\n\n\nThe Netherworld Yellow Spring Road,\n\n\n\nThe dazzling beauty of the other side of the shore,\n\n\n\nThe roar of the faceless woman,\n\n\n\nThe cheongsam woman's polite appointment,\n\n\n\nEverything,\n\n\n\nIt seems that they are all moving away from him......",

For Zhou Ze, the entire world was now his prison cage, a cage covered with a black cloth.\n\n  No one could see him,\n\n  and no one could communicate with him.\n\n  He couldn't pick up a single solid object.\n\n  Even,\n\n  the wind could blow right through him with ease.\n\n  He was so frail.\n\n  The phrase \"too weak to withstand the wind\" was no exaggeration for him.\n\n  Moreover, what shocked and terrified Zhou Ze the most was that,\n\n  he could see faint specks of light constantly drifting away from his body.\n\n  In other words,\n\n  his body was slowly fading.\n\n  Perhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would disappear completely, the last, most insignificant trace of him wiped away.\n\n  He didn't know how any of this was happening, but he knew that his time was truly running out.\n\n  In the tale of the Eight Immortals, Tieguai Li entered the body of a man who had starved to death, becoming the figure known in later legends.\n\n  Zhou Ze had also heard stories of ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to resurrect.\" He wanted to do that, too. He was cold and panicked; he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\n  He didn't even care who the person was.\n\n  At times like these, people are always selfish. Zhou Ze was no exception. Besides, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\n  But every time he tried to approach someone, flames would appear above their head and on their shoulders, making it impossible for him to get close. The attempt even harmed him, accelerating the rate at which he \"evaporated.\"\n\n  He was a little tired, and a little numb.\n\n  He was waiting for his end,\n\n  waiting for his conclusion.\n\n  As someone who had already died once, facing death a second time actually made him feel a bit more composed.\n\n  Besides, in his current state, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would have to endure this torment.\n\n  *Creak…*\n\n  Ahead, there was a shop with its lights still on. It looked like a bookstore, because he could see rows of bookshelves through the glass door.\n\n  Someone pushed the door open from the inside and walked out. It was a man in a hoodie. He wore the hood up, obscuring his face. After looking left and right for a moment, he hurried away.\n\n  Of course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away.\n\n  At first, Zhou Ze didn't think anything was out of the ordinary, but shortly after the man left, he suddenly sensed a warm presence from inside the bookstore.\n\n  Yes,\n\n  a warm presence.\n\n  This warmth was baffling to Zhou Ze, but right now he was like a man about to freeze to death who suddenly finds a box of matches. Even knowing the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike one, just to feel that final bit of warmth before he died.\n\n  Zhou Ze walked toward it. His body passed directly through the bookstore's glass door. He continued inside, coming to the area behind a bookshelf.\n\n  Behind the bookshelf,\n\n  lay a person.\n\n  It was a handsome young man, probably only twenty-three or twenty-four. Because the air conditioning was on in the store, he wasn't wearing much, just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\n\n  He was lying on the floor, but from him, Zhou Ze sensed a feeling of warmth, like a pauper who stumbles upon a bag of gold coins on the road at night.\n\n  The attraction was irresistible, and the current Zhou Ze was in no position to refuse!\n\n  Zhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of the young man.\n\n  He didn't know how to enter the other's body, but he understood how to touch the warmth he so desperately needed.\n\n  He reached out a hand and placed it on the man's chest.\n\n  Zhou Ze saw his fingernails actually begin to slowly embed themselves into the other person's body.\n\n  It was a bizarre sensation, different from when the \"gentle breeze\" had blown through his body on the street. This was a fusion, a merging with his fingernails as the medium.\n\n  Slowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other's body. The two started to overlap.\n\n  ………………\n\n  \"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze was woken by a series of shoves. No, more accurately, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his head having been resting on his arms.\n\n  \"Hey, wake up!\"\n\n  The woman's voice was shrill, high-pitched, and carried a tone of command.\n\n  Lifting his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, more accurately, she was a girl, probably high school age. Although she was a big girl, she still had a trace of childishness about her.\n\n  \"Hey, Xu Le, what's your problem? You think you've grown a backbone, huh? Trying to give my parents and my sister an attitude? You actually dared to not come home all night!\n\n  Who gave you the nerve!\"\n\n  Xu Le?\n\n  Who's that?\n\n  Zhou Ze spread his hands in confusion. He saw that they were smooth. His own hands had developed calluses from long hours of practicing with surgical instruments, but these hands had none.\n\n  \"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\n  The girl slammed her palm on the counter, looking ferocious.\n\n  Zhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to a mirror by the door. He saw his reflection—a stranger's face. No, he had seen this face before. It was the face he saw last night.\n\n  This body…\n\n  is mine?\n\n  \"Hey, what's your deal? My parents are both angry, and my mom's throwing a fit at home. Let me tell you, the food you eat, the clothes you wear, it's all from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law,¹ have to put on airs in my family's house?\n\n  Who are you trying to impress!\n\n  If you dare not come home again tonight, believe me, I'll come over here and slap you!\"\n\n  The girl raised her hand threateningly, but she suddenly noticed that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" wasn't cowering and begging for mercy like usual. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\n\n  Just then, she glanced at the time and saw it was already 7:30.\n\n  \"Hmph, I'm going to school. I'll deal with you tonight!\"\n\n  The girl stormed out in a huff.\n\n  Zhou Ze, meanwhile, slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a cell phone next to it.\n\n  Even now, he still hadn't managed to adjust to his change in identity.\n\n  He was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng City. And he was an orphan.\n\n  And now,\n\n  he had become this person.\n\n  What did that girl just say?\n\n  I'm… a live-in son-in-law?\n\n  I have a wife?\n\n  And a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\n  And judging by the way his new sister-in-law just spoke to her \"brother-in-law,\" his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly lived up to the fine traditions of old.\n\n  A live-in son-in-law, commonly known as one who marries into the wife's family, was not only looked down upon by his wife's relatives but, in ancient times, by all of society. Their status was similar to that of criminals. During the Han and Tang dynasties, men forced into military service at the frontiers often included such sons-in-law.\n\n  He picked up the phone. It wasn't password-protected. Whether the previous owner was lazy or just didn't dare to set one, it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\n\n  His QQ contacts list was sparse, just a few middle school, high school, and university classmates. Then there was a \"Family\" group with only one person in it, labeled \"Wifey.\"\n\n  He opened the chat history with her. Empty.\n\n  Alright, then.\n\n  Zhou Ze opened WeChat and, after a bit of searching, found the contact labeled \"Wifey.\" There were replies here. It was mostly Xu Le asking questions, like what's for dinner tonight, what preparations need to be made, how much money is needed for restocking, how much the bookstore has made recently, a whole bunch of stuff about how she was feeling,\n\n  and her replies were often perfunctory and cold,\n\n  consisting of:\n\n  \"Oh\"\n\n  \"Mm\"\n\n  \"Okay\"\n\n  as substitutes.\n\n  Zhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This interpersonal situation was a bit complicated. He glanced at his hands. His fingernails looked no different from a normal person's.\n\n  But the old man he treated before the car crash, his escape from the faceless woman, his entry into this guy's body—in all these events, his fingernails had played a crucial role.\n\n  As the thought crossed his mind,\n\n  just then,\n\n  Zhou Ze saw his fingernails begin to slowly lengthen, turning a glossy, translucent black. A faint black mist even swirled around them.\n\n  \"Hoo…\"\n\n  He let out a long breath.\n\n  Closed his eyes.\n\n  When he opened them again,\n\n  his fingernails were back to normal.\n\n  From morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the unease brought on by the transition. He didn't even eat lunch, either because he forgot or because he simply didn't feel hungry.\n\n  This was still Tongcheng City. Zhou Ze's old home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District. The two weren't far apart.\n\n  It wasn't until the afternoon that Zhou Ze sighed and silently stood up. Since he was here, he might as well settle in.\n\n  He began to try dusting the bookshelves. At the very least, he could find something to do.\n\n  The old man who had choked him before dying had said \"he's been discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said \"you'll be caught sooner or later.\" These words planted a seed of crisis in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n  His current state could be considered \"eking out a life.\" To be reborn after death was a blessing from the heavens, so he cherished it. At least, until he had a clear grasp of the situation and enough clues, he had to immerse himself in this identity. It was best not to cause any major abnormalities, not to attract the attention of those \"people who want to catch him.\"\n\n  Business at this store was truly terrible. The decline of the traditional book market was nothing new, and this place wasn't on some prime real estate right outside a school.\n\n  One could only say that for that \"Xu Le\" to choose to open a bookstore here, just breaking even was probably a question mark.\n\n  It wasn't until three in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\n\n  The customer milled around the elementary school readers section, and milled around for a very long time.\n\n  Zhou Ze waited a while before finally walking over. \"What genre are you looking for?\" he asked.\n\n  Though, Zhou Ze didn't know much about it himself.\n\n  \"Just browsing,\" the other person replied.\n\n  \"Mm,\" Zhou Ze said, and paid him no more mind. He hadn't yet settled into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\n\n  But just then,\n\n  the other person suddenly walked up behind him and spoke in a low voice:\n\n  \"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n  \"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"Last night, I hit you over the head with a baseball bat and stole your money.\n\n  And I made a point of checking.\n\n  You were definitely no longer breathing.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Live-in son-in-law (上門女婿):** A man who marries into his wife's family and lives with them, often taking their surname.

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned for a moment. So, the only reason he’d been able to possess the body of this \"Xu Le\" and reanimate a borrowed corpse last night was because the man had just been killed?\n\nBecause the body was still warm, he was able to get in?\n\nLooked at it this way, he... seemed to have been quite lucky.\n\nThere was no revulsion, no anger, and certainly no panic at the thought of his identity being exposed. Zhou Ze turned and looked at the man behind him, who was about his own age.\n\nThe man was taken aback.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy.\n\nIt was relief.\n\nAnd even...\n\n...a hint of appreciation.\n\nAs a host, Zhou Ze knew what a difficult situation he had faced last night. If this guy hadn't happened to kill someone at that exact moment, his own soul might have scattered to the winds, never to see today's sun.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night. When I woke up this morning, my head felt awful, like I was drunk. I've forgotten what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the man would guess he was a ghost who had reanimated a corpse, unless the guy's brain was full of water.\n\n\"You're not mad at me?\" The man pointed at his own nose, sounding somewhat incredulous. \"Even after I told you I knocked you out cold from behind yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine. In fact, thank you for not taking the phone and computer from my desk.\"\n\n\"Uh... I forgot,\" the man said, scratching his head. \"It’s good that you’re okay. This is the money I robbed from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man proactively took three hundred yuan out of his pocket, then fumbled around and produced another eight hundred.\n\n\"The eight hundred is for your medical bills, the three hundred is what I robbed,\" the man said, pressing his lips together. \"I was gambling online yesterday and lost my whole salary to some dog of a bookie.¹ I was passing by your bookstore and suddenly had the idea to get some cash. After I knocked you down, I realized you weren't breathing. I was scared to death.\n\n\"I ran home and couldn't sleep all night, just thinking the police would break down my door and arrest me at any moment. Home invasion, robbery, plus murder... and all for three hundred yuan. I felt so stupid, so not worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\n\"Buddy, it's so good you're not dead. Really. I've been wandering around outside since this morning, waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for them to show up. Then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\n\"You know? At that moment, I almost fell to my knees and kowtowed to you. Thank you. You're tough, you didn't die. Otherwise, I'd be finished. There are so many cameras here. If you'd died, there's no way I could've gotten away.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the one thousand one hundred yuan in his hand, then at the \"murderer\" before him, confessing with tears in his eyes. The whole scene felt bizarre.\n\nTo be honest, \"Xu Le\" was dead. Because he was dead, Zhou Ze could occupy his nest. And because Zhou Ze had occupied his nest, the man before him was spared a murder charge.\n\nBoth he and the man before him had benefited. The only one who got screwed was that unlucky bastard, Xu Le.\n\n\"Alright, it's all good. I probably just had the wind knocked out of me last night.\" Zhou Ze moved the man's hand off his shoulder. He had been an emergency room doctor in his past life; what kind of filth hadn't he seen? Yet in that extreme environment, he had developed a bit of a clean streak. In fact, most ER doctors were clean freaks to varying degrees.\n\nIt was precisely because he had witnessed so much filth and grime that he had learned to cherish \"cleanliness.\"\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" the man asked, somewhat delighted.\n\n\"Yeah, I don't blame you.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Go live your life and work hard. Don't make the same mistake again.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy. you're a real one.\"\n\nThe man nodded emphatically, left the bookstore, and went off to greet his \"new life.\"\n\nZhou Ze, however, picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he should still call the police—not to report the man for murdering him (Xu Le), but to report him for suspected theft.\n\nLet the police investigate, anyway. If the man had a criminal record or had done other bad things and got caught, he deserved it.\n\nSince he had taken over the man's body, he ought to do something for the unlucky soul.\n\nAlthough, given the man's good attitude in admitting his mistake and even giving him money for medical expenses, to still report him by name was indeed a rather scummy move, the kind of thing that would get you cursed to have a son with no ******.\n\nBut just as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the operator's voice came on the line,\n\nat the shop entrance,\n\nthe man suddenly returned.\n\n\"One more thing...\" The man had just walked in when he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He froze, then pointed a finger straight at Zhou Ze. \"You were still going to call the police, you son of a bitch, weren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see the phone! Give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You went back on your word, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly flew into an agitated, frenzied state. He probably had some mental issues, perhaps from being disconnected from society by the rhythm of a gambler's life. He was prone to extremism when triggered.\n\nThe man lunged. Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to back away.\n\nIn his previous life, he was a doctor, not a boxer, nor had he ever practiced martial arts. This new body was also rather frail. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was genuinely a bit panicked.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man slammed Zhou Ze against the wall, his hands clamping tightly around Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I'll teach you to call the police! I'll teach you to go back on your word! Fine, I'll make you die, really die! This time, I'll strangle you and then bleed you out! We'll see if you're still not dead then!\" the man roared, grinding his teeth.\n\nBusiness at the bookstore was pitifully slow. In the afternoon, forget customers, there were barely any pedestrians outside.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he could no longer breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. In the process, his fingernails suddenly turned black and grew long.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze wrapped his hands around the man's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shuddered, his eyes rolled back into his head, and he let go of Zhou Ze's neck. He staggered back a few steps, knocking over several bookshelves before collapsing to the floor with a thud.\n\nFreed, Zhou Ze rubbed his neck. He hadn't actually been that panicked. After all, his fingernails could harm even the evil ghosts of Hell; dealing with an ordinary person shouldn't be much of a problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze still wasn't entirely clear on the reason for these nails or what their use was. All he knew was that they must have been \"transmitted\" to him by the old man he had treated before his car accident.\n\nIt really was like they say,\n\n*Got a fungal nail, and it spreads to two.*²\n\nHe walked over, squatted down, and patted the man's face. Thankfully, he wasn't dead, still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n...\n\nAfter giving his statement at the police station, the officer told Zhou Ze to wait in the small lobby. The case Zhou Ze had reported was a bit weird—he claimed a man came to his door intending to rob him, but the one who ended up knocked out was the \"perpetrator.\" And now this perpetrator was still in the hospital, so they had to wait for him to wake up to get further confirmation.\n\nStill, at least the officer hadn't put Zhou Ze in handcuffs.\n\nSquatting next to Zhou Ze was a middle-aged man whose left hand was cuffed to a radiator pipe.\n\n\"Bro, you're awesome. That guy was trying to rob you and you took him down?\" the scruffy-faced middle-aged man said, rubbing his grimy, long bangs. \"That's the kind of style I had when I was young. With these clueless petty thieves, you gotta beat 'em to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you, behave yourself,\" a young policeman said as he walked over. \"How many times have you been caught stealing scooter batteries this winter?\n\n\"I'm telling you, it's almost New Year's. Can't you just keep your head down? Or find a proper job, earn some money, and send some home to your family? You're a grown man.\"\n\n\"Work? Working is impossible. It's impossible for me to work in this lifetime. I don't know how to do business. I can only get by in life by stealing electric scooter batteries. Going to the detention center feels like going home.\n\n\"Everyone in there is talented, and they're so nice to talk to. I love it in there!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young policeman didn't want to deal with this character anymore and turned to leave.\n\n\"Bro, what did you think of my little speech just now?\" the greasy middle-aged man asked, winking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Pretty interesting,\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol. Che Guevara, do you know who he is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Let me tell you, life is all about...\" The greasy middle-aged man paused, his gaze shifting to the entrance. \"Well, I'll be. She's gorgeous. Is that a cop?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the entrance, a woman in a blue down jacket and knee-high leather boots was walking toward them with another female officer.\n\n\"Probably a cop,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, it was the aura she possessed that was her greatest asset.\n\n\"But she's not in uniform,\" the greasy man countered.\n\n\"Maybe she's plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right. A beautiful police belle, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in here more often,\" the greasy middle-aged man said, smacking his lips, as if savoring the thought. \"If I could marry her, I'd give up ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. When it came to things like lifespan and mortal years, he didn't dare make jokes anymore.\n\n\"You don't agree?\" Seeing Zhou Ze shake his head, the greasy man grew anxious. \"You're blind! A woman like that, trading ten years of your life for her is definitely not a loss...\"\n\nJust then, the female officer and the woman in boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to take you home. The investigation over there is clear. You're free to go,\" the female officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" said the greasy middle-aged man.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹`狗莊 (gǒu zhuāng)`: Literally \"dog banker,\" a derogatory slang term for the house or bookie in gambling.\n\n²`得了灰指甲，一個傳染倆 (déle huīzhǐjiǎ, yíge chuánrǎn liǎ)`: A line from a very well-known, somewhat cheesy TV commercial jingle in China for a fungal nail infection treatment.

    "content": "Officer, excuse me, what was my wife's name again?\n\n***\n\nThis thought only crossed his mind for a moment; Zhou Ze wasn't *that* stupid. But he genuinely had no idea what his \"wife's\" real name was. In this day and age, very few people used their real names for their QQ or WeChat IDs.\n\nThe greasy man, however, shot Zhou Ze a reproachful glance: *Bro, that's not cool. Weren't we supposed to be each other's broken-winged angels?*\n\nZhou Ze returned an equally helpless look: *I'm as surprised as you are.*\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and whispered, \"I make really good dumplings.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nHis \"wife\" spoke in a cool, detached tone, then turned and walked out on her own.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow.\n\nShe was driving a Cayenne and got right in.\n\nZhou Ze opened the passenger door and sat down.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nit was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unlucky bastard Xu Le had had a slightly more normal marriage and family life, Zhou Ze wouldn't be in such an embarrassing situation. He could have at least come up with some excuses for his wife's concern, like claiming he was dizzy and couldn't remember certain things.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the air of an ice queen, looking like she had no interest in talking to him at all. Even picking him up from the police station felt like she was just going through the motions.\n\n*My dog got lost, the security guard found it, and I'm going to pick it up.*\n\nThat's what it felt like.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as him (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car got onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence.\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence again.\n\nThe woman felt that her husband was being unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to investigate why.\n\nJust then, her phone rang. She put it on speaker, and a voice came through the car's sound system:\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's just been a school bus collision on Youth Middle Road. The injured are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you back here immediately.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly taken aback.\n\n*So my wife is a doctor, too.*\n\n*Also,*\n\n*my wife's surname is 'Lin'.*\n\n\"I know. I'm on my way back,\" the woman said, hanging up. She immediately took the next exit off the highway, made a U-turn at the traffic light, and headed toward the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or tell him to get out and take a cab. Instead, she drove all the way into the parking lot of the Chongchuan District People's Hospital.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze had been worried she would tell him to get out and find his own way home. He imagined himself having to swallow his pride and ask:\n\n\"Honey, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\nIt felt so foolish.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got into an elevator, and Zhou Ze followed her in. The woman went into the women's locker room, and Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench in the hallway.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived: one critically injured, and another five children with serious injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and rush out to begin treatment,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench in a daze.\n\nThe feeling was a bit like a mother who brings her son to work; while mom is busy, the son just watches from the side, playing by himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe hospital's unique smell of disinfectant and the stuffiness from the central air conditioning... it was a nostalgic, familiar feeling.\n\nThe emergency room was just ahead. The critically injured patient, whose life was hanging by a thread, appeared to be a little girl.\n\nThe accident involved a kindergarten school bus. Watching one small child after another crying in pain on the operating tables was a truly heartbreaking sight.\n\nZhou Ze pressed his lips together. In the past, at a time like this, he would have already changed into his scrubs and joined the treatment efforts. He had been the most famous surgeon of the younger generation in Tongcheng. But now, he could only be a spectator.\n\nIt was a very uncomfortable feeling, but he could only endure it. Besides, this People's Hospital was considered the best hospital in Tongcheng on paper, with an unquestionable quantity and quality of doctors. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next group of children was brought in. Their injuries were less severe, only requiring their wounds to be cleaned or simply bandaged.\n\nA traffic officer stood guard at the entrance to the floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, highly emotional, but letting them in at this moment would likely disrupt the medical treatment. They could only be held back for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, and walked to the window at the far end of the corridor. He pushed the window open, then pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. He smoked, and so did Xu Le, which was convenient.\n\n\"Mister, you're not allowed to smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nJust as he put a cigarette between his lips, a clear, young girl's voice came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze turned to see a little girl in a lily-print dress standing behind him, her lips pursed as she looked at him with a pout.\n\n*Ahem,*\n\nThis was a bit awkward.\n\nZhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public decency was always a bit embarrassing.\n\n\"Aren't you cold in just that, little one?\" Zhou Ze asked, bending down.\n\nThe little girl's skin was delicate, her face had a touch of baby fat, and she had big eyes. She was very cute, like an oversized Barbie doll.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" the little girl said, shaking her head. \"Mister, you can't smoke in the hospital in the future, okay?\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded earnestly.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine. The other kids are all hurt. They're in a lot of pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways to look at the other children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying; it wasn't so much that the pain was unbearable, but rather that when one child cried, the others would follow suit.\n\nThe nurses were trying to comfort the children while treating their wounds.\n\nOutside, the parents, temporarily held back by the police, were shouting and cursing.\n\nIn short,\n\nthe entire floor felt chaotic.\n\n\"You're very lucky, then,\" Zhou Ze remarked.\n\nThere wasn't a single scratch on the little girl.\n\n\"Mhm, I was sitting in the back row, so I'm okay,\" the little girl nodded. Then she took the initiative to run over and comfort her classmates, checking on one, peeking at another, encouraging and reassuring them.\n\nShe was a very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned back around and subconsciously took out a cigarette again, only to think better of it and put it back.\n\nAs he walked back to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors emerged from the emergency room ahead.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor—the female doctor being his wife.\n\n\"It's okay, we did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to put a hand on the shoulder of Zhou Ze's wife as a gesture of comfort.\n\nAs the husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there.\n\nBut he wasn't offended by the scene...\n\nThat damn Xu Le had left him in such a complicated mess—a live-in son-in-law with a hot-tempered sister-in-law and equally ill-tempered in-laws.\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would hurry up and have an affair, kick him out, divorce him, and leave him in peace.\n\nWho, after just dying and being reborn in a new body, would have the energy to deal with the myriad dramas of life as a modern-day kept man?\n\nHowever, what surprised Zhou Ze a little was that his wife actually raised her hand to block the doctor's wandering hand and pointed directly at him, saying:\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\nThere wasn't a trace of tenderness in her words. It was simple, blunt, as if she were saying: *This is the husky I keep at home.*\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir,\" the male doctor said, his expression a bit awkward. No matter what, hitting on a woman right in front of her husband always made one feel a little less confident.\n\nZhou Ze smiled as a greeting. *Looks like my dear wife is very faithful...* but he couldn't feel happy about it at all. It wasn't some cuckold complex acting up,\n\nit was simply that a simpler life would be so much better.\n\n\"I'll go check on the others. The other children have all been treated and should be fine. You should go home and rest early with your husband,\" the male doctor said before walking away.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves, dropping them on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, her pearly teeth gently biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a very bad mood, which meant that the critically injured child hadn't been saved.\n\nThis look of hers was truly pitiable and lovely.¹\n\nZhou Ze began to understand Xu Le a little. This live-in son-in-law had it better than most of his peers. The prerequisite was that his in-laws were better off than him, and on top of that, this Dr. Lin was genuinely beautiful.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience this a lot more in the future. Just seek peace of mind.\"\n\nZhou Ze offered his consolation as a seasoned veteran. His experience was far richer than his \"wife's,\" and his ability to handle psychological stress was naturally much stronger.\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe woman retorted with those two words. If Zhou Ze had spoken as a senior colleague, his words would have indeed been counseling.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le. For someone with his image to say such things to Dr. Lin was a classic case of someone speaking lightly of a burden they didn't bear.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze shrugged, once again scorning that Xu Le in his mind. *Look at how pathetic you are. Your wife dares to tell you to shut up in public.*\n\nWith red eyes, Dr. Lin slowly stood up. \"I'm going to change. We're going home.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt that moment, two nurses pulled back the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the gurney inside. A small body lay on it, covered with a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over it. He had seen plenty of dead people. In his years as a doctor, he had saved many lives, but there had also been many patients he was powerless to help, who had died right in front of him.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, is that your husband?\" a young nurse asked in a teasing tone. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but unlike the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses, Dr. Lin's husband had never shown his face at the hospital.\n\nYou couldn't blame them for cracking a joke in the face of death. It was like expecting those artsy types who post on social media about how their souls have been purified and how moved and pious they feel after one trip to Tibet to actually live there for ten years; it's just not realistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin nodded in acknowledgment. By now, her emotions had calmed down a bit.\n\n\"Well, you two should hurry home then. Who knows what activities you have planned for tonight, right?\n\nI'm telling you, our Dr. Lin loves children. You two should hurry home and...\"\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\n\"...\" The young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze saw the hem of a lily-print dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind went *BOOM*, and he suddenly realized that the uninjured little girl he had just seen...\n\nShe wasn't human!\n\n***\n¹ A Chinese idiom, *wǒ jiàn yóu lián*, which literally means \"Even I [a woman] would feel pity upon seeing her,\" used to describe a woman who looks exquisitely beautiful in her sorrow or frailty.",

    "content": "This single word, \"fuck\"—\n\nafter he said it,\n\nthe two young nurses were at a loss, and Dr. Lin was also stunned for a moment.\n\nThe response was just too simple and crude.\n\nZhou Ze, however, didn't offer any explanation. He reached out directly and uncovered the white cloth covering the girl's head.\n\nIt was her. It really was her!\n\nNo wonder she didn't have a single injury just now, not even a scratch on her body.\n\nThis wasn't because of the luck of sitting in the back row.\n\nIn fact,\n\nshe was the most seriously injured of all the children. She was the one the doctors had just been trying their utmost to save.\n\nHer soul had already drifted out, yet she was unaware. She was still reminding me not to smoke in public, still going to comfort her classmates who had minor injuries.\n\nIn reality,\n\nthose children couldn't see her at all.\n\nIn the entire hospital,\n\nthe only person who could see her,\n\nwas Zhou Ze!\n\n\"She's dead?\" Zhou Ze asked, his eyes scanning the surroundings.\n\n\"Xu Le?\" Dr. Lin looked at her husband. She didn't want to deal with his cursing just now, because she found her husband was acting abnormally.\n\n\"She's not dead yet! You keep saving her, keep resuscitating!\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly grabbed Dr. Lin's arm, pulled her over, and roared,\n\n\"The time limit for resuscitation isn't up yet! She still has a chance to wake up! Keep resuscitating!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze grabbing Dr. Lin so roughly, the two nurses immediately came forward to pull him away. In their eyes, Dr. Lin's husband was being baffling, and he even seemed to have a tendency toward domestic violence.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the two nurses aside, let go of his grip, and murmured in a low voice,\n\n\"Where are you? Where are you? Where on earth are you!\"\n\nZhou Ze rushed out. He was running, searching.\n\nJust a moment ago, the girl's soul was still wandering among the children, comforting them. Now, she was nowhere to be found.\n\nHad she already gone to Hell?\n\nShe was already dead.\n\nWas it too late?\n\nZhou Ze was a bit lost. He didn't know why he was so agitated, nor did he know why he was so anxious.\n\nPerhaps it was because of his profession—it was his duty to treat any patient who could possibly survive. And besides, he'd just had an encounter with that kind and strong girl.\n\n\"Mister, are you looking for me?\"\n\nA familiar child's voice sounded from behind Zhou Ze. He spun around immediately and saw the little girl again.\n\nOnly, the little girl's body was no longer as solid as before. She had now become semi-transparent.\n\n\"Mister, I'm a little cold.\" The little girl hugged her arms and squatted down. \"I went to find the nurses to ask if I could borrow some clothes, but they ignored me. Do they hate me? Am I really annoying?\"\n\nSpecks of light were continuously dissipating from the little girl's body. Zhou Ze had seen this scene before; it had once happened to him.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\n\nDr. Lin walked over at that moment.\n\nThe little girl turned her head to look behind her.\n\n\"Don't look!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward, reaching out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen if she saw her own body lying on the hospital bed.\n\nWould she break down?\n\nWould she realize she was dead and simply dissipate?\n\nWhen Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, his fingernails grew slightly hot. They didn't grow longer or turn black, but Zhou Ze could feel a searing heat. At the same time, the little girl's body began to distort, transforming into a halo of light that wrapped around Zhou Ze's fingertips. And this light, it was clear, was invisible to everyone else.\n\n\"Move! She can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze charged toward the hospital bed again.\n\n\"Xu Le!\" Dr. Lin's chest heaved. The deceased was gone. She didn't know why her husband was still babbling on like a madman. Besides, her husband had studied civil engineering; he had absolutely no connection to medicine.\n\nThis time, when Zhou Ze rushed over, the two young nurses didn't dare to stop him. Zhou Ze ripped back the white cloth and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\n\nYes, this was how he himself had come back to life.\n\n*Your soul came out, but it can go back in. You can live!*\n\nAfter seeing the light from his fingertips completely enter the girl's body, Zhou Ze began to perform CPR, placing one hand over the other and starting chest compressions on the girl.\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\nThe two nurses didn't dare to get close, looking instead to Dr. Lin.\n\n\"She's dead,\" Dr. Lin said, walking up to Zhou Ze's side.\n\n\"The golden hour for resuscitation isn't over yet, I've been keeping track of the time,\" Zhou Ze roared while continuing the compressions. \"She can live, she can live!\"\n\nDr. Lin pressed her lips together, reached out, and pushed Zhou Ze aside. Then she began to perform chest compressions herself, her hands stacked on the girl's chest.\n\n\"You're using too much force. She has internal injuries. A-Chun, reconnect the monitor. Continue resuscitation.\"\n\nZhou Ze was pushed aside but didn't get angry. He just kept staring at the little girl on the bed.\n\nThe only saving grace was probably that the parents were being held back by the traffic police, and with so many children making noise outside, no one noticed what was happening here.\n\nDr. Lin continued the compressions, beads of sweat already forming on her forehead. She didn't know why she was joining this man in his madness, but for some reason, she had just seen something unusual in his eyes.\n\nAnd this man was her husband, but today, she felt she couldn't see through him at all.\n\nThe monitor was reconnected, but the screen still showed a flat line.\n\nThe two young nurses stood by, at a loss.\n\n*Can't be saved?*\n\n*Even after I put her soul back,*\n\n*she still can't be saved?*\n\nA sense of disappointment and loss began to spread through Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n\"Beep... beep... beep...\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe previously flat line suddenly showed a wave.\n\nDr. Lin stared at the monitor in utter shock.\n\nWas this...\n\na medical miracle?\n\n***\n\nIt was already evening by the time they drove home from the hospital. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat while Dr. Lin drove. The two of them were still not speaking.\n\nSilence seemed to be the default setting for their husband-and-wife relationship. Usually, however, it was Xu Le who tried to break the silence. Today, it was Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Have you studied medicine?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Your technique just now was very professional.\" Dr. Lin could tell.\n\n\"They trained us when I was getting my driver's license,\" Zhou Ze casually made up an excuse.\n\n\"But you don't have a driver's license.\" Dr. Lin frowned slightly.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*Hmph.* Zhou Ze silently cursed Xu Le in his heart once again.\n\nDr. Lin didn't intend to press the matter further. She just said, \"Today, thank you for your persistence.\"\n\n\"No need to thank me.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least in his heart, he still considered himself a doctor. Saving a patient really didn't require thanks.\n\nThe girl hadn't woken up yet and was still in a coma, but at least now there was hope.\n\n\"I'm thanking you on behalf of that girl.\" Dr. Lin picked up her phone to check the time. \"It's almost eight. My parents are waiting for us to come home for dinner.\"\n\nParents?\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a headache coming on.\n\n*I have to meet my mother-in-law and father-in-law already?*\n\nThe car entered a high-end residential complex. Tongcheng was near Shanghai, geographically situated with Shanghai at opposite ends of the Yangtze River's mouth. Although land here wasn't as exorbitantly priced as in Shanghai, property values were still not cheap.\n\nDr. Lin parked the car and started walking in. Zhou Ze followed behind her. The two entered the elevator, got out together, and Dr. Lin used a key to open a door.\n\nThe apartment was well-decorated, a duplex layout. In fact, you could tell from the car Dr. Lin drove that the Lin family was likely very well-off.\n\nOf course, his current identity as a \"live-in son-in-law\"¹ was also proof. After all, a family without some money and confidence couldn't afford to take one in.\n\nOn the living room sofa, an elderly man with graying hair, wearing a sweater, was watching television. It was a rerun of the national news broadcast, and he was watching with great interest.\n\nEven when his own daughter and son-in-law returned, he merely glanced at them without saying a word.\n\n\"Wanqiu, you're back.\"\n\nThe kitchen door was pushed open, and his mother-in-law poked her head out. Perhaps Dr. Lin and her younger sister had inherited their height from their mother. The mother-in-law was very tall. She was a bit plump now, but she was still the type who could dominate the \"Sunset Glow\"² square dance and make countless old men and grandpas bow in admiration.\n\nTapping the blackboard, taking notes, highlighting the key point,\n\nZhou Ze finally knew his wife's full name—Lin Wanqiu.\n\nThe mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze, her expression clearly sinking.\n\n\"Old man, dinner's ready. Wanqiu is back.\"\n\n\"We can finally eat.\" The sister-in-law came out of the study. She shook her fist at Zhou Ze, then jutted her chin, signaling for him to be mindful of her parents.\n\nIt was a nice little gesture. Although the girl was a bit bossy, she wasn't completely unreasonable.\n\nZhou Ze went to the bathroom to wash his hands. While he was washing, Lin Wanqiu came in too. The two of them used soap to scrub their hands, both of them very meticulous.\n\nLin Wanqiu glanced at Zhou Ze a couple of extra times, then rinsed her hands and walked into the living room.\n\nZhou Ze also finished rinsing, wiped his hands with a paper towel, and walked out of the bathroom.\n\nEveryone was seated. Zhou Ze sat down in the chair next to Lin Wanqiu.\n\nThe mother-in-law, her face grim, brought out the bowls of rice one by one. When she placed one in front of Zhou Ze, she clearly used a little extra force.\n\n*At least,*\n\n*she didn't deliberately not give me any rice.*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n\"Xu Le, do you think we treat you badly?\" the mother-in-law asked before she even started eating.\n\n\"You treat me very well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then why didn't you come home last night? Who were you giving the cold shoulder to...\"\n\n\"Mom, let's eat. He had something to take care of at his shop. He told me,\" Lin Wanqiu cut in.\n\nThe mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged a glance, surprised that their elder daughter was actually speaking up for this son-in-law. It threw them off, and for a moment, they forgot to continue their attack.\n\nThe sister-in-law, watching from the side, was also surprised. Her older sister had never cared much about this so-called brother-in-law. Had the sun risen in the west today?\n\n\"Let's eat.\" The father-in-law picked up his chopsticks. \"You eat too.\" He pointed his chopsticks specifically at Zhou Ze.\n\n*Hmm, that gesture was a little rude, but at least it signaled that last night's incident was over.*\n\n\"Wanqiu, have a piece of braised pork. Mom stewed it for a long time.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law placed a piece of meat in both her elder and younger daughters' bowls. Then, after a moment's hesitation, she placed a piece in her son-in-law's bowl as well.\n\nIt was only then that Zhou Ze realized he hadn't eaten anything all day. Ever since he'd been reborn in this body last night, he hadn't eaten breakfast or lunch.\n\nHe didn't stand on ceremony.\n\nHe picked up the meat and put it in his mouth.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze's expression froze.\n\nAn unexpected wave of nausea rose up from within him, and his stomach began to spasm violently.\n\n\"Gag...\" Zhou Ze retched dryly, as if what he was eating was poison.\n\n\"...\" The mother-in-law.\n\n\"...\" The father-in-law.\n\nThe atmosphere at the dinner table,\n\ninstantly dropped to freezing.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Live-in son-in-law (上門女婿, *shàngmén nǚxù*):** A man who marries into his wife's family and lives with them, often taking their surname.

    "content": "\"My apologies.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand to show it wasn't intentional, because this was truly a slap in the face—especially considering he had no idea why \"Xu Le,\" this live-in son-in-law, was so disliked by his parents-in-law.\n\n\"Not feeling well?\" Dr. Lin asked, putting down her chopsticks.\n\n\"I'm fine, I'm fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled rice into his mouth.\n\nBut just as the food entered his mouth, before he could swallow, his stomach convulsed again. A profound wave of nausea rose from deep within him, as if what he was about to swallow wasn't rice, but what comes *after* you digest rice.¹\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze sprayed the rice from his mouth, spattering it all over the faces of his father- and mother-in-law, who were sitting across from him.\n\nHis father-in-law's glasses and hair were speckled with rice grains.\n\nHis mother-in-law's pinned-up hair was also dotted with glistening white specks.\n\nWith a *clatter*, the chopsticks fell from his father-in-law's hand. His face twitched a few times, as if he hadn't yet processed what emotion to respond with in this situation.\n\nHis mother-in-law, however, took a deep breath, the fury in her eyes already blazing!\n\nThis was... blatant disrespect!\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe mother-in-law shoved her chair back and stood up.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law was a retired head nurse, so she knew that even if a person was sick, it was impossible to spray rice that dramatically. Besides, from the looks of him, Xu Le didn't seem to be on death's door.\n\nHe was doing this on purpose.\n\nHe must be doing this on purpose!\n\nHe was rebelling!\n\nRebelling!\n\nClutching his chest, Zhou Ze left the dining table and rushed into the bathroom. He lifted the toilet lid and began to retch violently.\n\nThis time, he even vomited up bile, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.\n\nSo much for this meal.\n\nDr. Lin looked toward the bathroom where Xu Le was still retching nonstop, then spoke directly to her younger sister.\n\n\"Xiao Yi, go cook some noodles.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. She also felt that her brother-in-law was playing with fire today. She immediately left the table and went to the kitchen to prepare some dried noodles.\n\n\"How outrageous! That bastard!\"\n\nThe father-in-law slammed a hand on the table, then took off his glasses and shook them. Xu Le's father-in-law was a retired deputy hospital director who usually paid the utmost attention to his refined appearance; today, his limit had been well and truly crossed.\n\n\"I'm going to ask that guy just how our family has wronged him! We didn't ask for a single cent of bride price for the wedding, and we even paid to open that money-losing bookstore for him! How have we wronged him!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law prepared to march to the bathroom.\n\n\"Mom, let's clean this up. He's not feeling well.\"\n\nDr. Lin began to clear the barely touched plates from the table.\n\n\"You're still defending him after all this?\" The mother-in-law, fuming, pointed at her daughter and scolded her.\n\n\"What else am I supposed to do? Who was it that threatened to hang themselves to force me to marry him?\" Dr. Lin looked directly at her mother, her beautiful face looking exceptionally resolute at that moment.\n\nThe mother-in-law was at a loss for words. It was true; they were the ones who had forced their daughter to marry. They had been desperate to have a grandson, so they had gone to great lengths to recruit Xu Le as a live-in son-in-law. At the time, they thought it was simple: they only had two daughters, so they had no choice but to find a son-in-law who would move in, and the grandson would take their family name. Xu Le's parents were gone, and he was a college graduate, so he fit the criteria.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nThe father-in-law didn't dare to meet his daughter's gaze. He had been the one to make the final decision. Thinking back on it now, he really had wronged his daughter. He stood up and went back to his study.\n\n\"Hey, old man, you have stomach problems,\" his wife called out anxiously.\n\n\"Mom, bring Dad a bowl of noodles later.\"\n\nAfter clearing the table, Dr. Lin walked toward the bathroom.\n\nThe mother-in-law watched her daughter's back but didn't say anything more.\n\nPushing open the glass door to the bathroom, Dr. Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling by the toilet, one hand gripping the edge of the bowl, the other clutching his chest.\n\n\"Are you unwell?\"\n\n\"I'm okay,\" Zhou Ze answered. He'd been perfectly fine before dinner; who knew that he'd end up like this the moment he tried to eat.\n\n\"I asked Xiao Yi to make some noodles. You can eat later...\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nAt the mere thought of noodles, Zhou Ze felt another intense wave of nausea well up from deep inside him, and he started dry-heaving again.\n\nLin Wanqiu frowned slightly.\n\n\"Should we go to the hospital?\"\n\n\"No need, it's nothing. I'm not eating.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand and forced himself to stand. He went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face.\n\nTonight's dinner was destined to end on a sour note.\n\nHis parents-in-law and sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu's bedroom was on the second.\n\nAfter cleaning up, Zhou Ze also took a shower. Not knowing where his clean clothes were, he didn't bother changing and went upstairs with his hair still damp, wearing his previous clothes. Just as he reached the top of the stairs, he saw that Lin Wanqiu was showering in the second-floor bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the bathroom door for a moment, watching the graceful silhouette reflected inside, and lightly licked his lips.\n\nPeople are always at their most impulsive at times like this. Of course, at times like this, they also know best how to be grateful.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nZhou Ze said silently in his heart.\n\nThis was the first time in the two days since he had been reincarnated that Zhou Ze gave the unlucky bastard Xu Le a thumbs-up.\n\n*Even though you left behind an utterly messed-up set of relationships, your wife... is really beautiful.*\n\nWith a hint of fantasy, a hint of excitement, a hint of impatience, and a hint of hope, Zhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door.\n\nAnd then, Zhou Ze's expression changed. He bit his lip.\n\nIn his mind, he dragged out the very same Xu Le he had just praised and proceeded to viciously flog his corpse ten thousand times.\n\nThe bedroom was large.\n\nThere was a large bed.\n\nAnd next to the large bed, was a pallet on the floor!\n\nWhat on earth could this mean? Even an idiot would get it!\n\nWas that guy out of his mind?\n\nWas he a moron?\n\nWhat was the point of being a live-in son-in-law like this?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths, then silently lay down on the floor pallet.\n\n*Just sleep.*\n\n*No more drama.*\n\n*Don't think about it.*\n\nHe'd see if he could get some money, become independent, and then whether it was divorce or something else, he would resolve this complicated relationship. Having been reincarnated into this body, he still had many problems to face.\n\nLin Wanqiu finished her shower and came out. She was wearing a blue pajama set. The pajamas were a bit loose, making them look baggy on her.\n\nLying on the floor, Zhou Ze subconsciously swallowed.\n\n\"Get up,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You've always slept on the bed, and I've slept on the floor,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze silently got up and climbed onto the bed.\n\nLin Wanqiu turned off the light and lay down on the floor pallet.\n\nPerhaps this was her compensation for not being willing to share a bed with Xu Le—she slept on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze sighed and prepared to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, he wasn't asleep. He turned over.\n\nAn hour later, still not asleep. He turned over again.\n\nEven three hours later, past midnight, he was still wide awake.\n\nHis eyelids were fighting to close, but he just couldn't fall asleep.\n\nMeanwhile, Lin Wanqiu, on the floor, was breathing steadily. She must have been asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it wasn't because there was a beautiful woman sleeping next to him that he was too worked up to sleep.\n\nHe was exhausted and drained; after all, so much had happened today.\n\nBut he just couldn't fucking fall asleep.\n\nLying on the bed, Zhou Ze simply opened his eyes and looked at his hands.\n\nToday, he had used these hands to save that little girl's life. Although the girl hadn't woken up yet, her vital signs had returned. There was still hope.\n\nWas this a special ability he'd gained after his trip through hell?\n\nOr, was it something that old man left behind when he grabbed his wrist before he died?\n\nStill, the feeling wasn't bad.\n\nAs a doctor, with a pair of hands like this, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that transcended medical technology and understanding, one that could even allow him to surpass the likes of Hua Tuo and Bian Que. Practitioners in every field hope to one day surpass their legendary predecessors. Perhaps it wasn't for money, or for fame, but for a kind of... professional pride.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze suddenly felt his arms convulse, and a sharp pain shot through them.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze sucked in a breath of cold air and curled up on the bed.\n\nBut the pain continued, and it was escalating!\n\nA cold sweat broke out from the pain. Unable to bear it, Zhou Ze got out of bed and left the bedroom.\n\nHe went into the bathroom and, without turning on the light, sat on the toilet. In the dimness, Zhou Ze could see veins bulging all the way down his arms to his fingernails, looking as if they were about to burst.\n\nThe pain came from them, as if something was hammering at his very bone marrow.\n\nDamn it.\n\nWhat the hell was happening!\n\nZhou Ze's face began to contort.\n\nThis feeling was so agonizing it made him wish for death. It even gave him the urge to grab a kitchen knife and chop off his own arms.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to recall the image of himself lying in an ice-cold coffin, about to be pushed into an incinerator.\n\nHe also seemed to recall fragments of his time in hell, trudging numbly toward his end.\n\nWas this a curse?\n\nWas this a punishment?\n\nWhat was I being punished for?\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I snuck back?\n\nBecause I'm not a living person, so Heaven is punishing me?\n\nOr... was it because I used it to save someone today?\n\n*That's it. That must be the reason.*\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he had used that ability to save someone, he had broken some rule and was now suffering a backlash.\n\nThen...\n\nThen if I go kill that girl right now, will the pain stop?\n\nIn his eye sockets, wisps of black mist began to gather, though he was completely unaware of it.\n\n\"Mister, you're not supposed to smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nThe little girl's voice surfaced in Zhou Ze's mind again.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head violently.\n\n*No.*\n\n*I saved her, and that's that!*\n\n*I don't regret it.*\n\n*I don't regret it!*\n\n...\n\n\"Mom, are you not done yet?\"\n\n\"I just got in. Go use the bathroom on the second floor.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law went up to the second floor. She really couldn't hold it anymore. The upstairs bathroom light was off, so she pushed the door open and walked right in.\n\nAnd then, just at that moment, Zhou Ze looked up at her.\n\nShe also looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nHis eyes were hazy with black mist, carrying an immense, intimidating power. It was the gaze of a malevolent ghost crawling out of hell—cursed and insane.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law screamed in terror.\n\nThen she collapsed onto the floor.\n\nShe stared at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze stared back at her.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw that beneath his sister-in-law's pajamas—it was wet. An incongruous liquid had appeared on the floor tiles...\n\nHe had...\n\nscared her into wetting herself?\n\n***\n\n¹A pun in the original Chinese.

    "content": "A scream woke the whole family.\n\nAnd no wonder.\n\nImagine a bathroom, late at night, with the lights off. You're bursting to pee, you open the door, and suddenly see someone inside. That alone is scary enough; I'm sure most people have had a similar experience.\n\nWhat's more, the person his sister-in-law ran into was a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and helped her younger sister up.\n\n\"What's wrong? What's wrong!\"\n\nHer father- and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor. They saw their younger daughter crying in her sister's arms, and then glanced at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"Well, look at you, Xu Le! You bastard with a heart blinded by lard,¹ trying to pull something on my younger daughter!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law grabbed the broom by the bathroom door, ready to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was the same, angrily preparing to come in and teach his good-for-nothing son-in-law a lesson.\n\nAnd no wonder.\n\nSeeing this scene, anyone would naturally jump to that conclusion.\n\nThe brother-in-law had gone mad, making a move on his sister-in-law.\n\nAfter all, as the saying goes, half of a sister-in-law's... you-know-what... belongs to her brother-in-law.\n\n\"Mom, Dad, Xiaoyi just got scared when she went into the bathroom,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law froze, the broom raised in her hands, unsure of what to do with it.\n\nThe father-in-law also paused, then retreated a few steps, looking a bit sheepish.\n\nThis interruption distracted Zhou Ze, and he suddenly noticed that the bulging veins on his arms had subsided, and the intense pain had vanished along with them.\n\nHe suddenly felt so tired, so sleepy, and just wanted to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, ready to leave the bathroom. As for his father- and mother-in-law, Zhou Ze really couldn't be bothered with them. He had no interest in cleaning up the mess left by that wimp, Xu Le.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze stood up, his sister-in-law shivered several times in fright and burrowed deeper into her sister's arms.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. What had she seen just now?\n\n\"What on earth is going on!\" The mother-in-law stood with her hands on her hips, questioning her younger daughter. This didn't look like a simple scare. \"Xiaoyi, my sweet girl, tell Mommy, what really happened? Did he... do something to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was quite honest, and she knew she couldn't lie about something like this, or the consequences would be severe.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, and when I opened the door, I saw him sitting there. It was so scary!\"\n\nAfter mustering the courage to say this, the sister-in-law buried her head in her sister's arms again.\n\nAlright.\n\nIt was just a misunderstanding after all.\n\n\"You brainless oaf, who goes to the bathroom late at night without turning on the light?\n\nYou think my house is like yours, so cheap and stingy?\n\nCouldn't bear to spend a little on electricity!\n\nIf you scare my daughter into having problems, how are you going to compensate me...\"\n\nThe mother-in-law started berating Zhou Ze, her finger almost poking him in the face.\n\nZhou Ze was exhausted at this moment. When a person is severely sleep-deprived, they tend to be extremely irritable. Plus, Zhou Ze had long grown impatient with the god-awful family network Xu Le had left him.\n\nIf they weren't sleeping in separate beds, Zhou Ze might not have lashed out.\n\nBut now that they were, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to take any more of this snobbish mother-in-law's attitude.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nZhou Ze swung his hand, slapping away the finger his mother-in-law was pointing at him.\n\n\"Leave me alone.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened, clearly in disbelief that this usually timid son-in-law would dare speak to her like that.\n\n\"Is that how you talk to your mother? Have you no manners at all!\" the father-in-law scolded.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to be a divorcée, then go on and lecture me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze shot back, then shoved his father-in-law aside with his shoulder and walked back to the bedroom.\n\n\"Bang!\" The door was slammed shut with great force.\n\n\"Outrageous! Simply outrageous!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law hurried to her husband's side to soothe his chest.\n\nBut in the end, neither of them dared to continue the confrontation.\n\nAfter all, what Zhou Ze had just said carried a lot of weight for them.\n\nAlthough they didn't know what had gotten into their usually meek son-in-law—who normally wouldn't say a word even if you hit him with a stick—he was right. Once their eldest daughter divorced, she would be on her second marriage. It would be bad for her reputation, and for their family's reputation.\n\nFurthermore, in their view, a woman on her second marriage wasn't worth much and wouldn't be able to find a good family.\n\nIn truth, a person's character and whether their thinking is feudal has little to do with their education or family circumstances; it really comes down to the quality of the individual.\n\nJust like Xu Le's parents-in-law at this moment. No matter how angry they were, they didn't dare provoke their good-for-nothing son-in-law any further, terrified that he might actually stand up and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, taking a deep breath and closing his eyes, intending to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door.\n\n\"Xiaoyi is scared. I'm going to sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice. Then she left.\n\n*As if you ever really sleep with me anyway,* he thought.\n\n...\n\nThe next day at noon, the father- and mother-in-law were eating lunch.\n\n\"Did he go to the bookstore?\" the father-in-law asked his wife.\n\n\"He's not up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Unbelievable,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"Exactly...\"\n\nJust then, the mother-in-law stopped talking, because she saw Zhou Ze coming down the stairs. Zhou Ze's eyes were bloodshot, and he had severe bags under them.\n\nThe atmosphere was a bit stagnant.\n\nPerhaps because of last night's events, Zhou Ze's status as the family's live-in son-in-law had risen somewhat. At least, the father- and mother-in-law didn't say anything more to provoke him.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze, in his current state, looked like he could grab a knife and start hacking at people at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept over the dining table.\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest.\n\nThe smell of rice, the smell of meat...\n\nSo disgusting.\n\nHe felt like throwing up again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out the door, breathing in the cool, fresh air outside, which made him feel a bit better.\n\nHis head was groggy. Zhou Ze began to wander aimlessly through the streets. He needed to quietly think about some things, but his current state—desperately sleepy yet unable to sleep—made it difficult to truly calm down.\n\nIt was torturous.\n\nIt was agonizing.\n\nIt was like walking out of an internet cafe after pulling two all-nighters, or like a middle school student who stayed up all night reading a novel under the covers and then had to get up early for class.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. The surroundings felt somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign up ahead.\n\nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Tongcheng.\n\nHe'd actually wandered to his old workplace. Heh, maybe it was just because Tongcheng was so small.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the hospital, not to revisit old haunts, but intending to try and get some sleeping pills.\n\nHe could handle not eating, at worst he could just drink a lot of water and fill his stomach for a while. But not sleeping was long-term torture.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar work environment. On the photo roster of the emergency department on the ground floor, Zhou Ze saw that his own photo had been turned grayscale.\n\nHe then subconsciously walked to his original office. Someone new was at his desk. A middle-aged doctor with a pockmarked face was sitting in his seat. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk; the doctor's surname was Kang.\n\nHe let out a long sigh, a hint of wistfulness in it.\n\nZhou Ze temporarily forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps this feeling of \"things and people have changed\" temporarily suppressed the torment of sleepiness. Zhou Ze began to wander around the hospital.\n\nHe was savoring the bits and pieces of his life here.\n\nHis work,\n\nhis life,\n\nand,\n\nhis past.\n\nOr rather, his past life.\n\n*There's no going back, truly no going back,* Zhou Ze repeated in his mind.\n\nThen, without realizing it, he had gone down the stairs and arrived at the basement level.\n\nHe stood still. As a doctor who had worked here for many years, he knew the layout of this floor.\n\nSome equipment storage rooms, and then, the morgue.\n\nHe remembered having once lain in this hospital's morgue, where a mortuary makeup artist had worked on him.\n\nHe started walking again, heading towards the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to see it, the place where he had once lain. This was the explanation he gave himself for walking in that direction, but in reality, it was a special feeling, a pull from the unseen, that was guiding him forward.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the door to the morgue. It had an electronic keypad lock. Coincidentally, Zhou Ze remembered the password. Doctors from other departments probably wouldn't have much to do with this place, but Zhou Ze used to be in the emergency department. People brought to the ER were usually seriously ill or injured, and it was inevitable that some couldn't be saved and had to be sent here.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also served as a temporary morgue for the police. Some unidentified bodies or those that still needed to be \"processed\" would be temporarily stored here. This was common practice in many places; if the local police department lacked facilities or sufficient forensic staff, bodies were often kept at the local funeral home or hospital.\n\nHe entered the password.\n\nThe lock opened immediately.\n\nZhou Ze walked in.\n\nA chill washed over him.\n\nNot the kind of chill that pricked the skin,\n\nbut a special kind of gloom that seemed to extinguish the warmth in one's heart.\n\nInside the morgue, of course, lay bodies. This was a temporary resting place for the dead.\n\nNormally, there should have been an attendant stationed outside, but for some reason, Zhou Ze hadn't seen anyone when he walked in. Perhaps the person had stepped away.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. A few bodies were laid out on cold gurneys, covered with white sheets. Another body was wrapped in a floral quilt from home. Judging by the silver hair peeking out, the deceased was likely an elderly woman.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze was never very afraid of dead bodies. What's more, he himself was now a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the refrigerated cabinets, the kind with pull-out drawers.\n\nThe drawers containing bodies all had labels on the outside, recording the deceased's name, gender, and other information.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty drawer, reached inside, and closed his eyes. As he slowly took in the sensation, a feeling of intoxicating peace washed over him, as if only here could he find tranquility.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Zhou Ze lay down inside it.\n\n\"Creeak...\"\n\nThe drawer was slowly pushed in, until it was completely closed.\n\nQuiet.\n\nCold.\n\nSilent.\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids.\n\nDrowsiness washed over him.\n\nHe had finally found the feeling of sleep.\n\nBut he couldn't sleep just yet.\n\nBecause he didn't know...\n\nwho had just been standing outside, helping to push the drawer shut...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Lard-blinded heart*: A Chinese insult implying someone is greedy, shameless, and stupid.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze began kicking outward with his feet from inside, intending to get himself out, but then he heard *click-clack* sounds from the outside. This meant the lock on the ice coffin had been fastened.\n\nHe was locked in. He couldn't get out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt as if he had returned to the scene of being placed in that cramped coffin back then.\n\nOnly, this time, Zhou Ze wasn't frantic, nor was he enraged. He simply reached up and knocked on the metal panel near his head.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't think someone had come in just to help him push the ice coffin in and then lock it, unless that person was a deranged lunatic, and Zhou Ze didn't believe his luck was *that* bad.\n\nBesides,\n\nHe had closed the door after entering the morgue. A lunatic who knew the morgue's door code?\n\nYou buy that?\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze could only assume that some *thing* had \"helped\" him out, and had done so quite thoroughly.\n\nHowever, after his one-word inquiry, the outside remained silent.\n\nZhou Ze decided to ignore it. He closed his eyes again, preparing to get a good sleep.\n\nThis time, sleep came quickly.\n\nAfter all, he hadn't closed his eyes for two days, and so much had happened during that time. The accumulated fatigue was terrifying.\n\n*Even if the world floods after I'm dead, no one is stopping me from sleeping right now.*\n\n...\n\nHe didn't know how long he slept, but when Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he felt refreshed and clear-headed, a long-lost vigor returning to him. Unfortunately, his body was also frozen stiff.\n\nThe degree of stiffness was somewhat frightening. Zhou Ze did his best to wriggle his body in the narrow space, and a series of crisp \"cracking\" sounds echoed, so satisfying it made him groan unconsciously.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's ten fingernails also naturally grew long and turned black, gleaming with a strange luster. The stiffness in his body and the cold qi that would be unbearable for an ordinary person slowly gathered toward his fingertips.\n\nThe whole process didn't last long, but it made Zhou Ze no longer feel cold or uncomfortable.\n\nHe subconsciously kicked out with his foot again, and the ice coffin slid out naturally.\n\nThe lock...\n\nIt was unlocked?\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. He sat up on the steel slab, stepped down, and then pushed it back in.\n\nHis clothes were somewhat stiff, hanging on him like cardboard, which felt extremely uncomfortable. Zhou Ze's gaze swept around the room.\n\nThe Affiliated Hospital's morgue wasn't very large. Compared to the massive hospitals in big cities, it seemed almost bashful, but it still stored a considerable number of bodies.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know who had pushed him in earlier, and finding them now would indeed be a bit difficult.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had undone the lock while he was sound asleep, Zhou Ze didn't intend to start any unnecessary trouble here.\n\nHe walked toward the morgue door, planning to leave. However, as he passed the gurneys covered with white sheets, Zhou Ze paused.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about the bodies under the white sheets.\n\nIncluding the old woman wrapped in a floral-patterned family quilt, who also seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped.\n\nBecause he remembered that this old woman's head and feet had been swapped. The positions were reversed.\n\nIt was impossible that the morgue attendant had come in while he was sleeping, done nothing else, and just flipped the old woman around.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside the old woman and said:\n\n\"If it was you, and you don't come out now, I'm leaving.\"\n\nThe old woman pushing him in and locking it could have been malicious, but her silently unlocking it for him meant she didn't want to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone was about to come by, and seeing a storage locker with its latch open, they might have discovered him.\n\nAfter all, whether these lockers were locked or not was very obvious from the outside.\n\nHe waited for half a minute. There was no abnormality. Zhou Ze didn't plan on waiting any longer.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze really disliked this feeling.\n\nSo coy.\n\nPlaying hard to get.\n\nShe was clearly an old woman when she died, yet she insisted on putting on the airs of a young maiden.\n\nAlright, age discrimination was indeed wrong, but it was only human nature for a normal person's tolerance for a beautiful female ghost to be slightly higher.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian¹ had a face full of wrinkles and big yellow teeth, do you think Ning Caichen would still have fallen into a human-ghost romance with her?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked behind him.\n\nAn old woman with a full head of silver hair was crouched there, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief that had been washed until it was faded.\n\nBut ghosts have no tears, so from Zhou Ze's perspective, the old woman looked more like she was wailing without tears.\n\n\"You continue crying. I won't disturb you.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to leave.\n\nHe found that he was, after all, a common mortal. Even when looking at ghosts, he was a bit of a looks-ist.\n\n\"Help me. I have money,\" the old woman said suddenly.\n\n\"Hm,\" Zhou Ze grunted. He needed money.\n\nThe damned Xu Le had less than two hundred yuan combined in his Alipay and WeChat. Adding the one thousand one hundred that the \"murderer\" had returned, Zhou Ze's total assets were now less than thirteen hundred.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's house and savings from his previous life had probably all been donated to an orphanage. He was starting with nothing to his name.\n\n\"My money is in a hidden compartment in my cabinet. It's an old, yellow-lacquered wardrobe. There are thirty thousand yuan, and also my dowry from when I got married—a jade hairpin and a jade bracelet. I don't know how much they're worth.\n\nI died so suddenly, I didn't have time to tell my sons. I'm afraid they won't know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"I'll take a cut.\"\n\nThe old woman's face showed a hint of struggle, but she still nodded. \"That's only right.\"\n\nThe old woman knew that without an \"anomaly\" like Zhou Ze to pass on the message, her sons would probably never find the assets she had left behind.\n\n...\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zhou Ze took a taxi directly to a place in Tongzhou District called \"Xingdong Town.\" It wasn't too far; Tongcheng's airport was located in this town.\n\nEarlier at the hospital, Zhou Ze had made inquiries at the registration office. The old woman had died after resuscitation efforts failed upon her arrival at the hospital. Her family then abandoned the body at the hospital, leaving an unpaid medical bill.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived at the town and, following the old woman's description, found the village.\n\nIt was a self-built, two-story house. Attached to the house was a small brick outbuilding, like a rural latrine.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze got there, he saw several workers dismantling a building—the brick one, of course.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, handed a cigarette to one of the masters, and asked, \"Still busy, with the New Year so close?\"\n\n\"Gotta make more money for the New Year, y'know? Besides, we're all from the same village,\" the mason replied quite casually.\n\n\"What's going on with this house?\" Zhou Ze asked while peering inside. Two workers were already taking off the roof. The bricks from the small house's walls would be dismantled and saved for later use. As for the inside of the house, forget the yellow-lacquered cabinet the old woman had mentioned; there wasn't even a small stool in sight. It was completely empty.\n\n\"His old ma died. She used to live in this shack alone. Now they're planning to tear it down and build a new kitchen.\" The master leaned his head forward for Zhou Ze to light his cigarette, smiled a little sheepishly, and said, \"Look, the one who just walked past the front of the house, that's their eldest son.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man, whose hair was also turning white, had some bruises on his face.\n\n\"There are five brothers. They got into a fight over the few bucks their old ma left behind. When these bricks are taken down later, the other four will come to claim their share too.\n\nYou tell me, this world, it's different now, eh? Their mother's body is still at the hospital, they haven't even claimed it. None of the brothers are willing to pay off the medical debt.\"\n\n\"What about the old woman's things from the house?\" This was what Zhou Ze was concerned about. From the old woman's account, the thirty thousand yuan in the cabinet was her life savings, but the jade bracelet and hairpin were the truly valuable items. Selling them for a few hundred thousand shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\"Sold 'em to the junk collector, they did. Cleared 'em out long ago. Sold 'em right after the old lady was hospitalized,\" the master said, taking another hard drag from his cigarette. \"I gotta get back to work.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips with a wry expression. This trip was a complete waste of time.\n\nNot only did he not get a share of the old woman's belongings, but even her sons wouldn't get to enjoy them. They had just been handed off to some junk dealer who collected old furniture.\n\nZhou Ze felt frustrated now. Being broke was a real problem. He was unwilling to use his abilities to swindle money. Although it seemed easy and gratifying, saving that girl last time had nearly killed him with pain last night. God knows what other problems would arise if he continued messing around like that.\n\nWhether there were deities three feet above one's head, Zhou Ze didn't know.\n\nBut he knew for sure that if you kept digging three feet down, there was a hell, because he had been there.\n\nHe knew he wasn't human, and this was the human world. Besides, he vividly remembered how the patient who had died in front of him had screamed in terror, \"I've been discovered!\" right before his death.\n\nBut,\n\nMoney.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to get the millstone turning.\n\nBut who was going to pay?\n\nZhou Ze needed money now. Never mind escaping his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\"...\n\nAt the very least, he had to buy himself an ice chest or a large freezer, right?\n\nOtherwise, would he have to run to the hospital morgue every day to leech off their air conditioning?\n\nFeeling somewhat dejected, he lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, feeling utterly annoyed.\n\nJust then, the phone in his pocket rang. Zhou Ze took it out. It was an unfamiliar number. He answered the call.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Big Bro, the goods arrived safely. When are you coming to inspect them? The cops are cracking down hard lately, it wasn't easy getting this shipment in,\" the person on the other end of the line said in a low, careful voice.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nbut made no sound.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nthe image of Xu Le suddenly began to loom large in his heart.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Nie Xiaoqian** and **Ning Caichen** are the main characters of a famous story from the classic Chinese collection *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio* (聊齋誌異).

    "title": "Chapter Ten: Big Boss!",
    "content": "Anxious, uneasy, yet with a hint of secret delight and confusion—this was probably how Zhou Ze felt the entire taxi ride to the outskirts of Tongcheng.\n\nHe needed money, needed it badly, but he didn't need a *lot* of money. He had no use for a huge sum, at least not for the time being.\n\nHaving died and come back to life, he needed a sum of money to resolve the entanglements of his past life and the troubles of this one. After that, he would need to plan for the long term, not squander it on a life of extravagance and indulgence.\n\nFor example, leaving the Lin family. Although Lin Wanqiu was beautiful and elegant, he really couldn't be bothered to go back to that home. They had never been intimate, and he had never truly enjoyed any of the benefits of the marriage—and by the looks of it, that bum Xu Le hadn't either. Naturally, there was no sense of debt.\n\nSo, saying \"bye-bye\" came with no psychological burden.\n\nBut leaving that home required some preparation. He needed a place of his own, and he had to buy a freezer of slightly better quality. Zhou Ze didn't dare to browse the second-hand market for a discarded one. What if something went wrong while he was sleeping inside and he ended up playing himself to death? Wouldn't that be a colossal loss?\n\nMoney!\n\nEven a ghost needed money.\n\nBut from the way that person on the phone had spoken to Xu Le, Zhou Ze felt a new wave of apprehension. Xu Le, a live-in son-in-law in a modern city, so pathetic that he let his in-laws walk all over him, so pathetic that he and his wife slept in separate beds—turned out to be a hidden underworld boss?\n\nAlright, the contrast was thrilling, and it fit the style of an American TV show. The most incredible people always had a seemingly ordinary real-life identity.\n\nLike how Spider-Man was a high school student, and Superman was a newspaper reporter.\n\nSo, how should he handle this situation?\n\nHow should he deal with that group?\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to \"taint\" this identity of his, because that would mean endless trouble. The police hunting him in the real world was already more than Xu Le could easily handle, not to mention the people that the old man and the faceless woman had cried out about, the ones who \"will find you and will catch you.\"\n\nIt was a bit of a headache, and he still felt out of place, but Zhou Ze arrived at the abandoned small fertilizer plant nonetheless.\n\nTwo men were squatting at the entrance of the plant. One wore a somewhat shabby military greatcoat, the other a cheap, poor-quality suit.\n\nBoth men were squatting there with cigarettes between their lips, puffing away.\n\nZhou Ze paid the fare and got out of the car. The men immediately stood up and walked over to him.\n\n\"Our boss is waiting for you,\" the man in the greatcoat said in a deep voice.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and followed the man inside. The man in the suit resumed his squatting position, continuing to smoke as if keeping watch.\n\nOnce inside, Zhou Ze saw a bald, fat man wearing a gold chain, sitting on a plastic chair and drinking alone. When he saw Zhou Ze approach, the fat man immediately stood up.\n\n\"Brother Xu, you're finally here.\"\n\nThe fat man was huge, at least 185 centimeters tall. His gold chain was thick and gaudy, and the gold dust that had rubbed off onto his neck was even more ostentatious.\n\n\"Where are the goods?\"\n\nZhou Ze clasped his hands behind his back, his fingers interlocked lightly. There were only three people here. Taking them all down wouldn't be a big problem, but what would he do afterward? Turn them over to the police? Wouldn't he be implicated then?\n\nDeal with them himself through vigilante justice? Punish them in the name of the moon? That didn't seem right either. Given his sensitive identity, if he killed people wantonly, he might suffer the same kind of backlash as he would for wantonly saving people. He wasn't willing to test that theory lightly.\n\n\"Brother Xu is as direct as ever!\"\n\nThe fat man wiped his mouth, then reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched. He took a deep breath, forcing himself not to smack the fat man's greasy hand away.\n\n\"Come, this way!\"\n\nThe fat man made an inviting gesture, leading Zhou Ze to a small storeroom in the backyard.\n\nUpon walking in,\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nThe goods were piled up like a small mountain, covered by a black oilskin tarp.\n\nZhou Ze had never done anything illegal before, but he knew that with this much merchandise, according to the law, it was enough to have him shot hundreds of times over. He could get a stomachache from all the 'peanuts'.¹\n\n\"This isn't just for Tongcheng, is it?\" What Zhou Ze really wanted to ask was, *Did you guys just rob a warlord in the Golden Triangle?*\n\n\"Of course, Brother Xu. Tongcheng is still too small. This shipment will ultimately use Tongcheng as a springboard to flow into Shanghai.\" The fat man stretched. \"This time, let's hurry up and move the goods. We're going to make a fortune.\"\n\nZhou Ze touched his forehead, feigning difficulty. \"It'll be hard to move all of this in a short time, won't it?\"\n\nAfter all, this wasn't like selling cabbage, where you could just ride a tricycle around with a megaphone.\n\n\"Don't you worry about that, Brother Xu. We just need to distribute this batch to the guys below us. The profit might not be as high as selling it ourselves, but it's fast and guarantees the goods will move. Once this batch is done, we'll go get another,\" the fat man said nonchalantly.\n\n*Xu Le, oh, Xu Le, you even built up a whole drug distribution network. You really are something else...*\n\nAnd a big shot like this was actually bludgeoned to death by that idiot over 300 yuan!\n\n\"Brother Xu, come take a look. How's the quality of this batch?\"\n\nThe fat man lifted the oilskin tarp as he spoke.\n\nThen, a look of astonishment appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\n\nBecause what he saw wasn't a mountain of drugs, but stacks of books and discs.\n\n*Could it be hidden in the pages of the books?*\n\n\"Brother Xu, thanks to your classmate, getting this batch was a piece of cake. These discs are all popular movies still showing in theaters. I even made sure to copy a few JAVs² onto them. These pirated books and romance novels are also bestsellers on the market.\n\n\"And there's the expanded 20-part, two-million-word sequel to *Bai Jie*³ that you specifically wrote, Brother Xu. A lot of our downstream sellers have already pre-ordered this one. We won't have any trouble selling it.\"\n\n\"The 'goods' you were talking about... are these?\" Zhou Ze asked the fat man.\n\n\"Yeah?\" The fat man paused. \"Just these.\"\n\nDisappointed.\n\nVery disappointed.\n\nExtremely disappointed.\n\nAnd at the same time, so ashamed.\n\nXu Le was still Xu Le, after all. To ensure these pirated goods sold well, he had actually written a sequel to *Bai Jie* himself.\n\nAnd he wrote a two-million-word sequel at that.\n\nJust how much free time did he have...\n\n\"How much can I cash out?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I'm planning to pull out.\"\n\nSince they were business partners, he must have invested some principal.\n\n\"What? Brother Xu, you're planning to pull out?\" The fat man was surprised. \"We're just about to rake in the money, and you're pulling out now?\"\n\n\"Yes. This business doesn't exactly align with core values. I don't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze said this very seriously. He didn't want to take even the slightest risk, especially before he had sorted out his current life. He didn't want to get drawn into any potential maelstroms.\n\n\"...\" The fat man.\n\n\"...\" The man in the greatcoat.\n\n\"Brother Xu's principles are lofty. I admire that. For the initial investment, Brother Xu, you put in...\"\n\nThe fat man held up four fingers and said, \"Twenty thousand yuan.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand it is, then. Give me the money. What happens next has nothing to do with me.\" Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to argue about it. Getting 20,000 yuan would solve his immediate crisis.\n\n\"Alright, I've got twenty thousand here.\" The fat man nodded and went to get the money.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze was in a ride-share heading back to the city with 20,000 yuan in his pocket.\n\nHe didn't go straight back to the bookstore. Instead, he went to an electronics market and spent over 10,000 yuan on a freezer. This type of freezer was generally used by businesses to store meat and other food products, and it was one of the higher-end models. Zhou Ze didn't hesitate to spend the money. After all, he would be relying on it to sleep from now on. He was afraid a cheap one would have problems.\n\nThe merchant was very helpful, sending a small truck to deliver the freezer right to... the bookstore entrance.\n\nAfter the driver and Zhou Ze moved the freezer into the bookstore, the driver looked a bit dumbfounded.\n\n\"Boss, you run a bookstore. What do you need a freezer for?\" the driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed him a cigarette. \"Business is slow. I'm thinking of selling some seafood on the side.\"\n\nThe driver took the cigarette and left. The delivery was done, and the rest wasn't his concern.\n\nThe bookstore had a small second floor, which Xu Le had originally used to store books. After Zhou Ze cleared it out, he placed the freezer up there. Looking at his \"new bed,\" Zhou Ze finally felt a great sense of relief.\n\nComing down from the second floor, Zhou Ze found someone in his bookstore. Not a customer, but his \"wife.\"\n\nDr. Lin was flipping through a magazine. Seeing Zhou Ze come down, she asked with some confusion, \"What were you busy with up there?\"\n\n\"Organizing merchandise,\" Zhou Ze said evasively.\n\n\"I'm off work,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"Mm.\" *You're off work, but you won't sleep with me...*\n\n\"That little girl has woken up.\" Dr. Lin looked pointedly at Zhou Ze. \"Her father wants to treat our department to dinner at the Tongcheng Grand Hotel. You should come too.\"\n\n\"What would I go for?\"\n\n\"The girl kept calling for her 'uncle' after she woke up.\" Dr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze curiously. \"Did you two know each other before?\"\n\n\"Even when people are unconscious, they can still perceive things, right?\" Zhou Ze continued to spin his tale. \"She probably sensed it when I was saving her.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not hungry. I have no appetite at all.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded and didn't press him further. She seemed about to leave, but she stopped at the bookstore's entrance. \"Are you coming home tonight?\"\n\nBack to the same old question.\n\n*I go home, but you still won't sleep with me...*\n\nSo, Zhou Ze answered decisively:\n\n\"Not tonight. I've been a bit busy lately.\"\n\nYes, even though business at the store had become as cold as an iced latte.\n\nDr. Lin hesitated for a moment, but didn't insist. She took her car keys out of her pocket, ready to leave.\n\nJust then,\n\n*Clang!*\n\nDr. Lin turned around to see her \"husband\" collapsed against a bookshelf, sending books tumbling to the floor.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin immediately rushed over to check on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt his vision start to blur, making it hard to focus. His chest heaved, and his legs went soft. A moment ago, it was as if he had stepped on cotton, completely losing his balance.\n\n\"Fainted from hunger...\"\n\nZhou Ze answered.\n\nHe,\n\nhadn't eaten in days.\n\n---\n\n**Author's Note:**\nFive days since the book was released, and we're second on the overall new book charts for this period!\n\nIn the horror category, aside from the Monthly Ticket Chart, which we can't be on because we're not a premium title, we're number one on all the other charts!\n\nYesterday, we were second in daily sales on Qidian!

    "content": "Next to the bookstore was a noodle shop. Business was just so-so, almost as deserted as Zhou Ze's bookstore.\n\nThis was because the pedestrian street had originally been built around a central plaza, but the plaza itself was now \"defunct.\" Aside from a movie theater, all the other businesses inside had moved out or closed down. As a result, the entire plaza had become a desolate, \"unfrequented\" area.\n\nAt least here in Tongcheng, the symptoms of overdevelopment in urban construction were already showing. In previous years, commercial centers had been planned and built on a massive scale, but Tongcheng wasn't Shanghai, after all; it couldn't supply that much foot traffic.\n\nFortunately, the noodle shop could still do takeout, and business, by the looks of it, wasn't bad. But obviously, no one would suddenly feel spiritually \"hungry\" and use a food delivery app to order a few books to go chew on.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back in his chair, still a little dizzy. Dr. Lin sat across from him, wiping his chopsticks with her own paper napkin before placing them in front of him.\n\nShe was meticulous and thoughtful, just as she had been when she let Xu Le sleep on the bed while she took the floor. But at the same time, she was also very cold.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother asking if she was genuinely opposed to a feudal arranged marriage or if she was simply a lesbian, because there was no point in asking. Zhou Ze himself wasn't interested in the bizarre network of family connections Xu Le had left behind, nor did he feel any attachment to it.\n\n\"Your health, is it really okay?\" Dr. Lin asked again.\n\n\"Minor issue, minor issue.\" Zhou Ze was a doctor himself. He knew that his problems with eating and sleeping were difficult to explain with the theories of modern medicine, let alone treat.\n\nLuckily, the sleeping problem was now sorted. But this eating... what a headache.\n\nIf he didn't eat, he'd pass out like he just had. But eating... the very thought made him nauseous.\n\n\"If you have a poor appetite, have a bowl of sour plum juice first,\" said the noodle shop owner. He was a man of about thirty, yet there were already some wrinkles on his face. The burdens of life seemed to weigh heavily on him.\n\n\"Sour plum juice, will it help?\" Zhou Ze asked, feeling a bit hopeless.\n\n\"It whets the appetite.\" The owner smiled, then shouted toward the back room, \"Honey, are the pickled vegetable noodles ready yet?\"\n\nThe owner walked into the back room, and the sounds of a husband and wife talking could be heard.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the sour plum juice in front of him. He picked up a spoon, scooped up a mouthful, and brought it to his lips. The moment he swallowed, Zhou Ze's expression changed.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin pulled out a facial tissue and held it to Zhou Ze's chin.\n\nZhou Ze's face twisted as he clutched his stomach.\n\nThen he took a deep breath and said:\n\n\"That's really sour.\"\n\nYes, so sour it felt like his whole body was about to cramp up, even overpowering the nausea.\n\n\"Coming, the noodles are here.\" The owner's wife walked over carrying the noodles, placed them in front of Zhou Ze, and said at the same time, \"You can't drink our plum juice that fast.\"\n\nDr. Lin glanced at the noodles and frowned slightly. \"These noodles... they're way too mushy.\"\n\nMeaning they had been cooked for too long, losing their springiness and seriously affecting the texture.\n\n\"Well... our noodles are always like this,\" the owner's wife said, looking ashamed.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand. Mushy or not, springy or not, it meant nothing to him at that moment. As long as he could get it down, that was enough. He needed energy. If he couldn't eat, Zhou Ze's only other option would be to go to the hospital for a glucose drip.\n\nWith great solemnity, he raised his head, feeling as dignified as a soldier on a suicide mission. Then he violently lowered his head and poured the entire bowl of unimaginably sour plum juice into his mouth in one go.\n\n*Ssssss...*\n\nThat sour kick,\n\nit was like pouring sulfuric acid into his stomach.\n\nBut immediately after, Zhou Ze grabbed his chopsticks and began shoveling noodles into his mouth, wolfing them down as ravenously as he possibly could. In five or six bites, the entire bowl of noodles was in his stomach. He then picked up the bowl and gulped down all the broth.\n\n*Huuuu...*\n\n*Smack!*\n\nZhou Ze set the empty noodle bowl down.\n\nHe let out a long breath. He had eaten it!\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze's hand flew to his chest. The nausea, which had been suppressed by the plum juice, came rushing back. But the food was already in his stomach. Zhou Ze practically had to clutch his own throat with both hands to keep from throwing it up.\n\nNot throwing up was a success.\n\nThe food,\n\nwas finally down.\n\nBeads of sweat had already formed on Zhou Ze's forehead. He grabbed a napkin from the table and wiped his brow.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nDr. Lin and the owner's wife were both staring, dumbfounded. Zhou Ze's manner of eating just now had been simply too horrifying.\n\n\"Hehe, looks like you were really hungry. Want another bowl?\" the owner's wife asked.\n\n\"No, no, that's alright,\" Zhou Ze refused.\n\n\"Okay then.\" The owner's wife cleared away the bowl and chopsticks in front of Zhou Ze and shouted to the back room, \"Honey, get the dough ready for the afternoon. The takeout orders should start coming in soon.\"\n\nThe owner's wife went inside. Her figure couldn't be called graceful; she was rather plain-looking, but the charm lay in her heavy chest and high, firm lower body, which added a special kind of allure that was exceptionally captivating.\n\n\"You like... her type?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nShe had noticed Zhou Ze watching the owner's wife go into the back room.\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. *I actually like your type, but you won't let me sleep with you.*\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled. The thought \"won't let me sleep with you\" had been in his mind for a long time, almost becoming an obsession. He had to admit, Dr. Lin was truly beautiful, and young too.\n\nEven though she was Xu Le's wife,\n\neven though Zhou Ze hadn't been married in his past life,\n\nif he were honest with himself,\n\nhe still wanted to sleep with her.\n\nIt was precisely because he couldn't that he agonized over it, that it was so often on his mind.\n\n\"Not going home?\" Dr. Lin asked again.\n\n\"Not going back,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"Then I'm leaving.\" Dr. Lin stood up. \"Call me if you need anything.\"\n\nAfter all, he was her husband in name, even if there was no substance to their marriage.\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze nodded. *If I'd known you were so easy to talk to and so considerate, I really should have borrowed some money from you when I was broke.*\n\nDr. Lin left, driving away in her Porsche Cayenne.\n\nZhou Ze, however, remained seated in the noodle shop. His bookstore was right next door. Even though he had finished his noodles, it was fine to sit and chat for a bit. They were neighbors, after all.\n\nThe owner came out from the back room and handed Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n\"How much do I owe you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Don't be a stranger. I can still afford to treat you to a bowl of noodles,\" the owner said with a magnanimous wave of his hand. They were neighbors who saw each other all the time; no need to get formal over a single bowl of noodles.\n\n\"Won't your wife chew you out?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She won't. She's just a woman, what does she know? It's not her place to talk,\" the noodle shop owner said, his male chauvinism on full display.\n\nNo matter a man's status at home, he always had to put on a front outside. No man wants to admit he's afraid of his wife, just like no man wants to admit he can't get it up.\n\n\"Hehe, your wife is quite pretty,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nJoking about another man's wife is a taboo. If two men were facing outward, joking about some woman walking down the street, that would just be locker-room talk.\n\nThe owner paused for a second but didn't say anything, just smiled. The owner had a good temper. People who run small businesses generally understand that harmony brings wealth.\n\n\"Her figure is great,\" Zhou Ze continued. \"Solid, full of flavor, just like the noodles I just ate.\"\n\nThe owner took a heavy drag from his cigarette.\n\n\"How is she in bed?\" Zhou Ze asked, this time pushing his luck even further.\n\nThe owner's fists clenched slightly, but he quickly played it cool. \"Those legs of hers... they could squeeze a man to death. Powerful!\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nThe owner smiled too.\n\n\"Can you handle it?\" Zhou Ze asked again. \"She's at that age where she wants it, right?\"\n\nThe owner pounded his lower back. \"Can't handle it anymore. Not a young buck anymore.\"\n\n\"Then, how about you let me have a try?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe owner's face turned completely dark.\n\nHis knuckles cracked as he clenched his fist.\n\n\"If you can't, I can. I'm still young,\" Zhou Ze said to himself, though the words felt a bit dishonest. Xu Le's physique, no matter how young, felt like a silver spear with a wax tip. It wasn't even as well-maintained as Zhou Ze's own body from his past life.\n\n\"Isn't that taking the joke too far?\" The owner was still reining in his temper.\n\n\"What if your wife agrees?\" Zhou Ze pressed on.\n\n\"Was that your wife just now?\" the owner asked, changing the subject.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Would you be willing to give her up?\" the owner asked.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then shook his head. Even though she was Xu Le's wife, she was his in name now. Zhou Ze wasn't willing.\n\n\"Then what makes you think I'd be willing?\" the owner retorted.\n\n\"Who's to say you don't have some special tastes or unusual fetishes? That sort of thing isn't exactly rare these days, is it?\"\n\n\"Brother, it's been a long time since I've had to hit someone,\" the owner said, standing up.\n\n\"Call your wife out. Ask her. I want to hear her say whether she's willing or not.\" Zhou Ze leaned back slightly, smiling.\n\n\"Heh.\" The owner took a few steps closer to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Stand here and call for her,\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"You're asking to die!\" The owner lunged at him.\n\n\"Can she come out?\" Zhou Ze asked suddenly.\n\nThe owner froze.\n\nThen, a look of terror appeared on his face, and he stumbled back several steps in fright.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked toward the back room on his own. He lifted the curtain. The room was empty.\n\nExcept for a woman's skin,\n\nhanging on a clothes hanger.\n\nBecause a breeze had entered when the curtain was lifted,\n\nit stirred gently,\n\ndrifting slowly.\n\n\"How... did you figure it out?\" the owner asked, slowly approaching. No joy or anger could be heard in his voice.\n\n\"Ever hear the saying... 'Who are you trying to kid?'\"¹ Zhou Ze turned to face the owner. \"Isn't it about time you peeled off that skin you're wearing, too?\n\nI'm very curious.\n\nJust how bored are you,\n\nto be here,\n\nputting on this kind of double act.\"\n\n***\n\n¹The original phrase `你糊弄鬼呢` (nǐ hùnong guǐ ne) is a common idiom meaning \"Who are you trying to fool?\" or \"Are you kidding me?\" However, it literally translates to \"Are you trying to fool a ghost?\" which adds a layer of meaning given the supernatural context of the story.",

    "content": "The boss smiled, not looking the least bit provoked. He just found it somewhat amusing.\n\nA person's disposition and presence are often more credible than their words.\n\n\"Sssssshhh-rip…\"\n\nThe crisp, drawn-out sound was like a snake shedding its skin. He began to tear off the skin from his body.\n\nAt the same time, the boss's frame and skeleton began to shrink, his physique slowly slimming down, like a balloon with a small hole slowly deflating.\n\nZhou Ze now finally understood why the bowl of noodles had been so overcooked.\n\nA \"transformation\" like that really did take some time.\n\nHe was still wearing the boss's clothes, still tied with an apron, but his face had changed into that of a somewhat boyish-looking young man.\n\nThe young man wore a smile on his lips, a natural coquettishness about him. The curve extending from the corner of his eyes, in particular, seemed capable of scratching that itch in the hearts of any man or woman nearby—just so, just right.\n\nTo describe a man as \"coquettish\" is a bit incongruous, but some men are indeed born with an alluring charm. Among the emperors of old, for instance, countless favored male companions, and the reason was that some men were, in fact, more womanly than women.\n\n\"Am I pretty?\" the young man asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt the nausea he had suppressed after eating the noodles surge up again. He waved his hand a bit apologetically, then clutched his chest, striking a pose that said, *I can't throw up.*\n\n*Who would know that of the meal in the dish, every grain comes from hard toil!*¹\n\nZhou Ze had a deep appreciation for food, especially food he had managed to swallow and was about to digest into energy for his body.\n\nThe young man sat down in a nearby chair, a lighter in his hand, which he twirled casually.\n\nHe was sizing up Zhou Ze, because Zhou Ze had seen through him. He had thought his imitation was seamless, and that in a place like this small eatery, nothing should have gone wrong.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nhe was imitating his own parents.\n\nEver since he was young, he had been observing his parents. Their every move, their every expression, was long since engraved in his heart.\n\n\"How did you find me out?\" the young man couldn't help but ask.\n\n\"You're not a ghost?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked at the same time.\n\nThe young man frowned slightly, thinking Zhou Ze was mocking him, saying he was playing at being a ghost.\n\nBut in reality, Zhou Ze had thought he was a ghost from the very beginning.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to meddle in other people's business. As someone who, not long ago, had been stressing over the cost of a freezer, Zhou Ze didn't think he had the right to meddle.\n\nBut this was business he couldn't ignore.\n\nThis business was happening right next door.\n\nSo Zhou Ze felt that, no matter what, it was best to expose the matter first. If it was easy to solve, he'd solve it. If it wasn't, he could just move again.\n\n\"Your fingernails,\" Zhou Ze said. \"I'm a bit sensitive about fingernails.\"\n\nWhen the boss's wife brought the noodles to him,\n\nWhen the boss personally handed him a cigarette,\n\ntheir fingernails were both visible to him.\n\nAlthough their fingers differed in thickness, fairness, and calluses, the patterns on their nail beds were the same.\n\nAnd lately, Zhou Ze had been paying even more attention to fingernails—not just his own, but others' as well.\n\nThe young man's eyes narrowed slightly, a sense of loss washing over him. The details hadn't been perfect.\n\nAlthough he had been careless, the fact that he was discovered was indeed his own failing.\n\n\"You're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nIf he was human, then this was truly incredible.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze hadn't seen many ghosts. Not counting his journey in Hell, the number of ghosts he had encountered in the mortal world could be counted on one hand.\n\n\"Skin-painting is my family's ancestral art.\" The young man stood up, reached out, grabbed Zhou Ze's hand, and placed it on his own chest. \"It's just that the line was broken for many generations. It was only with my generation that it could be picked up again.\"\n\nThe gesture was a bit ambiguous, a bit out of line, but Zhou Ze still squeezed subconsciously.\n\nZhou Ze would never admit that it was because Dr. Lin hadn't let him sleep with her that he was now developing an interest in men.\n\nOf course, the man before him was indeed more coquettish than a woman; that was a fact.\n\n\"No bones?\" An expression of surprise appeared on Zhou Ze's face. \"No, it's osteomalacia.\"\n\nOsteomalacia, also known as rickets, is caused by a calcium deficiency that hinders bone calcification, making bones soft and prone to deformation. Zhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he naturally knew a thing or two. But just as a single cold can have many variations and different pathologies, osteomalacia also has many sub-categories, and the young man before him must be an extreme case.\n\nAccording to unofficial histories from the Spring and Autumn period, a prince of the state of Lu suffered from this disease. He was as if without bones, his body pliant. He could walk like a person, but could also crawl like a snake.\n\n\"You can think of it as a genetic disease. It requires a certain probability to manifest. For many generations, my family couldn't master skin-painting because they didn't have this disease. But I…\"\n\nThe young man smiled, not finishing his sentence.\n\n\"So, you're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze still wasn't convinced.\n\n\"My name is Xu Qinglang,\" the young man replied very seriously.\n\n\"Then who were you imitating?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My dad, and my mom.\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment, a bitter smile on his face.\n\nWell now,\n\nthis was a huge misunderstanding.\n\nEarlier, after finishing his noodles, and after Sister Lin had left, Zhou Ze had intended to rip the paper window, deliberately provoking him with his words. He never expected that the guy was just playing a role-playing game to commemorate his deceased parents.\n\nBut from Zhou Ze's perspective, he had simply assumed this was a ghost, a ghost like the one in the story *Painted Skin*, who killed people, flayed their skin, and then paraded around in it.\n\n\"Then… my apologies.\"\n\nMaking fun of your mother… that really is a bit embarrassing.\n\n\"I'm not angry,\" Xu Qinglang said. \"But I am very curious. What did you mean by insisting I was a ghost?\"\n\n\"It was nothing.\"\n\n\"Have you seen a ghost?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I am a ghost,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Xu Qinglang very seriously.\n\nHis expression was stern, his look solemn.\n\nHe was baring his soul.\n\nXu Qinglang's face froze.\n\nThen, he couldn't stop himself from letting out a \"Pfft\" of laughter.\n\nHe looked at Zhou Ze\n\nas if looking at an idiot.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Sometimes, that's just how it is. You tell them the truth, and they think you're joking, so they don't believe you.\n\n\"Anyway, my apologies. By the way, I wanted to ask, was that skin… real human skin?\" Zhou Ze asked, curious.\n\n\"Fish skin,\" Xu Qinglang replied. \"Processed, painted, and crafted.\"\n\n\"Then why are you selling noodles?\" Zhou Ze couldn't understand. \"I heard that the Hezhen people's fish-skin clothing can sell for a lot of money, sold as art. Shouldn't yours be worth even more?\"\n\n\"Using an ancestral heirloom for profit… I can't bring myself to do it.\"\n\n\"Then you must be very rich,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"My family's home was just part of a demolition and relocation,\" Xu Qinglang didn't answer directly. \"I got over twenty apartments.\"\n\n\"…\" Zhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nSo, the world really is unfair. In his past life, he worked himself to the bone at the hospital and didn't make much money, while this guy just casually ends up with over twenty apartments.\n\nTong City wasn't Shanghai, but property prices were still close to ten thousand yuan per square meter.\n\nA second-generation demolition heir. So envious.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Are you going to keep making noodles?\"\n\n\"Are you going to keep selling books?\"\n\nThe two asked each other a question at the same time.\n\n\"I'll see how it goes for now,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Same here.\"\n\n\"Well, see you around. By the way, does your sour plum juice come in other flavors?\" Zhou Ze was curious about this. \"Like, bitter melon flavor? Grape flavor?\"\n\n\"I have a secret recipe. It can be done,\" Xu Qinglang said honestly.\n\n\"Excellent.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\nDamn it,\n\nit was like cotton.\n\nSo soft. He was really that pliant, really boneless. If you were to hold him in your arms in bed…\n\nZhou Ze immediately conjured an image of Dr. Lin emerging from the shower in her pajamas, forcefully suppressing his own improper thoughts.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the noodle shop.\n\nXu Qinglang went into the back room, lifted the curtain, and said to the woman's skin hanging there:\n\n\"Mom, do you think he really believed me or was he faking it?\"\n\nThe woman's skin swayed gently,\n\nswinging slightly,\n\nas if to say, *he didn't believe it*,\n\nand also as if to say, *she didn't know either*.\n\n………………\n\nZhou Ze returned to his shop. The freezer was already set up. The next step was to overhaul the broken-down bookstore Xu Le had left behind. Letting it continue to lose money like this was not a solution.\n\nThe sign at the entrance read \"Xu Le's Book House.\" It was as tacky as could be.\n\nIn short, in that guy's hands, this bookstore, from top to bottom, inside and out, exuded an aura of \"guaranteed to lose money.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down at the computer and tried several times to log into his original QQ account, but he couldn't. He couldn't get past the identity verification, and filing an appeal was basically impossible.\n\nAfterward, Zhou Ze had no choice but to go out and hail a taxi. He planned to get a new sign, or maybe a pair of couplets for the doorway.\n\nHe knew a man who ran a plaque shop, specializing in wood-carved plaques. The owner was an old man who often donated to the local orphanage. When Zhou Ze himself was a member of the orphanage, the old man was already donating. After Zhou Ze started working, he and the old man donated together.\n\nThe plaque shop wasn't far, located at the foot of Wolf Mountain. It was surrounded on all sides by shops selling incense and candles; his was the only one that sold plaques.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked in, he found the shop in the middle of a major clean-up. Even the shop's own plaque had been taken down.\n\nA middle-aged man was there, directing the workers.\n\n\"You are?\" the man asked when he saw Zhou Ze approach.\n\n\"I'm looking for Old Mr. Zhao,\" Zhou Ze said. He held the old man in high esteem.\n\n\"I'm sorry, my dad just passed away last month,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"Passed away?\" Zhou Ze was surprised and a little saddened. He and Old Mr. Zhao weren't actually close; they just knew of each other. Therefore, it was perfectly normal that he hadn't been notified of the funeral.\n\nBesides, for Old Mr. Zhao's family, the fact that he constantly donated the income from his plaque-making to the orphanage meant they probably didn't have a very good impression of the orphanage. They might not even have informed the orphanage of the funeral, afraid they would come asking for money.\n\n\"Are you here to order a plaque?\" the middle-aged man asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Our family isn't making them anymore,\" the middle-aged man said apologetically. \"From now on, we're selling incense and candles.\"\n\nWolf Mountain was one of the ten minor Buddhist holy mountains. Even if it didn't attract tourists from afar, the locals who came to burn incense and pray during festivals and holidays were enough to let the shops at the foot of the mountain make a hefty profit.\n\nThis was another form of living off the land—or in this case, the mountain.\n\n\"That's a shame,\" Zhou Ze said, feeling a little regretful.\n\nHe decided he would go visit the old man's grave.\n\n\"But we still have a few plaques my dad carved a while ago that wouldn't sell. I don't know why my dad carved them; they weren't custom orders. If you like any of them, I'll sell them to you cheap.\" The middle-aged man was planning to get rid of them with the mindset of selling off scrap.\n\n\"Alright, I'll take a look,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nHe followed the middle-aged man into a small courtyard out back. The man unlocked a storage room and turned on the light.\n\nInside were some miscellaneous items, including Old Mr. Zhao's tools, all piled up in disarray, a clear sign that his descendants had no intention of inheriting the craft.\n\nThese days, everyone wanted illuminated signs. Who would want one of these? It was hard work and didn't even make much money.\n\n\"Hoo…\" The middle-aged man blew a breath of air at several plaques on the floor. \"Take a look. Two hundred yuan each. If you see one you like, you can take it. If not, no big deal.\"\n\nClearly, the middle-aged man had little confidence he could get rid of these plaques.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to take a look.\n\nThe first plaque read:\n\n\"Life and death are ruled by fate; riches and honor are decreed by Heaven.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. The middle-aged man sighed, knowing that plaque was a no-go.\n\nThe next one read:\n\n\"Men know the terror of ghosts, but ghosts know the poison in men's hearts.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused for a moment. This one resonated with him.\n\nThe middle-aged man didn't sigh this time, because he knew it was a definite no. What kind of business owner had nothing better to do than hang something like that at their entrance?\n\nThe third one:\n\n\"Take it for what it's worth; thus have I heard.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze smile, the middle-aged man smiled too.\n\nAt least one of them was satisfactory.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.

    "content": "Having brought the plaques back, Zhou Ze planned to nail them up on either side of the entrance. He didn't particularly care which one went on the left and which on the right.\n\nHis next-door neighbor, the young man Xu Qinglang, was very enthusiastic.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze preparing to hang the plaques, he, who had been squatting at his doorway peeling garlic, went straight into his own place and brought out a hammer and nails.\n\nZhou Ze said thanks and took the hammer. It felt a bit greasy and heavy in his hand. Suppressing a slight sense of discomfort, Zhou Ze proceeded to nail up the two plaques.\n\nAfterward,\n\nThe two of them stepped back a few paces, looking at the plaques, at the door, at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze handed Xu Qinglang a cigarette as a thank you. Xu Qinglang helped Zhou Ze light it.\n\nThey both exhaled rings of smoke,\n\nPerfectly in sync.\n\n\"The atmosphere is there, isn't it?\" Zhou Ze said, a textbook case of praising his own wares.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"If I'm not mistaken, these two lines should be from the chapter titles of Ji Yun's *Jottings from the Thatched Abode of Close Scrutiny*.\"\n\n*Jottings from the Thatched Abode of Close Scrutiny* was a collection of stories written by Ji Yun, also known as Ji Xiaolan, similar to *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*, using tales of fox spirits and ghosts to express the author's own ideas.\n\nIn short, the couplet meant: these are all stories I've heard; everyone here, just listen to them as such.\n\n\"Mmm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Still too artsy. This shop of yours is still going to lose money.\" Xu Qinglang's assessment was blunt.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"In this world, there are too many stories. All sorts of bizarre and strange things happen every day, but there aren't many that are truly interesting.\n\nSome things are boring when told.\n\nSome things, you're not allowed to tell at all.\n\nSome things, no one will listen to if you don't change them.\n\nSome things, no one dares to listen to if you don't change them.\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at Xu Qinglang, stared for a good while.\n\nXu Qinglang lowered his head slightly, a blush creeping onto his face.\n\nHe was a man who cultivated a flirtatious demeanor, his charm innate. At this moment, he looked breathtakingly lovely.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze remain silent, Xu Qinglang continued:\n\n\"Take these stories of mountain sprites, fox spirits, and ghosts, for example. In the real world, where would such things actually exist?\" Xu Qinglang yawned. \"How can the morals conveyed through fake stories ever be that real?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to stare at Xu Qinglang, saying nothing.\n\nXu Qinglang started to feel his scalp tingle,\n\nBut Zhou Ze just kept staring at him.\n\nFinally, Xu Qinglang waved his hand, saying he had to go back to make his soup base. Walking back to his noodle shop, he felt as if there were spikes on his back, because just now, it felt as though Zhou Ze wasn't looking at him,\n\nbut at a joke.\n\nZhou Ze paid no mind to Xu Qinglang. Since they were neighbors, it was best they just stayed out of each other's way. In any case, they weren't in competition, and most importantly, Zhou Ze had no money to move his shop.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze sorted out most of the textbooks and supplementary materials in the bookstore and sold them for scrap paper prices to a junk collector.\n\nThen he went to the supermarket and bought ten small plastic chairs. The only two remaining bookshelves held books that Zhou Ze himself found somewhat interesting.\n\nAt this point, it was less a bookstore and more of a senior citizens' recreational activity center.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He wasn't very good at running a business. For now, he was just messing around blindly. Since Xu Le had been constantly losing money anyway, he felt no pressure.\n\nGoing up to the small second floor, Zhou Ze turned on the power to the freezer and set a temperature. He went outside, smoked a cigarette, and waited a while before reaching into the freezer to feel it.\n\nThe temperature was about right. Zhou Ze lay down inside.\n\nA freezer that cost over ten thousand yuan naturally had many functions, including a timer setting, which served as Zhou Ze's alarm clock.\n\nHe closed the freezer lid.\n\nZhou Ze placed his hands on his lower abdomen, lying perfectly straight.\n\nIt looked...\n\nas if he had passed away peacefully.\n\n...\n\nLate at night,\n\nA red car pulled over on the road in front of the bookstore. The whole street was somewhat deserted. Over by the storefronts, only the adjacent noodle shop and the bookstore still had their lights on.\n\nInside the car sat a well-dressed girl in a black down jacket, her hair draped over her shoulders. She looked rather cute and delicate.\n\n\"Xiao Bai, you bastard! I prepared for three days, and today you tell me you're off on a business trip? You can go to hell, get lost!\"\n\nThe girl hung up the phone, sitting in the driver's seat and fuming.\n\nThe Corgi in the passenger seat jumped onto the girl's lap. Its fur was glossy and flowing, clearly a good breed that was well cared for.\n\n\"Good boy. At least I still have you with me.\"\n\nThe girl lit a cigarette, stuck her hand out the window to flick the ash, and her gaze drifted outside. She saw the bookstore. Crucially, through the glass window, she could see that the furnishings inside were somewhat unusual. There weren't many bookshelves; instead, there were rows of plastic stools.\n\nGetting out of the car, the girl walked toward the bookstore, holding her Corgi. She didn't want to drive around aimlessly on Valentine's Night. She wanted to find a quiet place to sit.\n\nThe bookstore door was unlocked. After walking in, she could feel the warm air from the heater.\n\nThe girl, holding her dog's leash, first picked a random magazine from a shelf, then sat down on a plastic chair.\n\nShe let the Corgi off its leash, and the little guy began to \"explore\" the shop.\n\nAfter finishing the magazine, the girl stretched lightly. Feeling a bit thirsty, she called out:\n\n\"Hello? Is the owner here? Do you have milk tea or coffee?\"\n\nThe girl stood up, put the magazine back, and picked up an illustrated edition of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. After sitting back down, she couldn't help but call out again:\n\n\"Hey, owner! Are you dead or something? Is this how you run a shop in the middle of the night?\"\n\nA small sign hanging on the glass door read \"Now Open, Welcome.\" The door was open, and the heat was on; it was definitely still open for business.\n\nIf the girl had been a bit less polite or a bit more curious at that moment and had gone up to the second floor to take a look, she might have been impressed by her own unwitting prophecy.\n\nIn the cramped space of the second floor, there was indeed a freezer chest,\n\nand the owner was lying inside, truly like a dead person.\n\nNo,\n\nthe owner was a dead person to begin with.\n\nOf course, the girl probably wouldn't have had time to be impressed before she was scared out of her wits.\n\nA normal person enters a shop late at night only to find the owner lying in a frozen coffin—horrifying enough, right?\n\nThe girl lit another cigarette, growing impatient. She took out her phone and started playing with it.\n\nJust then, footsteps came from the top of the stairs. Zhou Ze hadn't woken up from the girl's shouting; he had woken up naturally.\n\nAs soon as he came down the stairs, Zhou Ze saw a small yellow figure dash toward his leg, asking to be picked up.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, bent down, and scooped the Corgi into his arms. The little guy wasn't shy at all, acting familiar with everyone.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze notice the woman sitting in the shop.\n\nOh,\n\nhis first customer since opening.\n\nBut he wasn't as excited as he might have imagined. Because today, all he had done was change the bookstore's sign and clear out the interior.\n\nHe still hadn't figured out...\n\nhow he was going to make money.\n\n\"Do you have coffee here, owner?\"\n\nThe girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at a water dispenser in the corner. There were disposable paper cups next to it.\n\nThe girl looked a bit exasperated, but she got up, poured herself a cup of water, and then sat back down on her plastic stool.\n\nOne owner, one customer,\n\nthey sat in mutual silence.\n\nAfter about half an hour of silence, the girl started scrolling through Weibo and watching videos. One video was particularly loud and boisterous:\n\n\"Step right up, don't miss out!\n\nSpirit money, blessed by this old Daoist, limited supply!\n\nYou can burn it now and withdraw it for your own use when you go down below, and you can even earn some interest, higher than Yu'e Bao!\n\nYou can also burn it for your relatives down below. Fast and convenient, honest with young and old, no trouble from the ghost bailiffs, and no skimming off the top!\"\n\nThe girl burst out laughing at the video. People often have a habit of sharing things they find funny. She looked up at the owner sitting behind the counter and said:\n\n\"Owner, have you seen this video? This old Daoist's livestream is pretty famous. He's practically an internet celebrity.\"\n\n\"Oh, a livestream?\" Zhou Ze was a bit puzzled. He took out his phone. Xu Le's phone had a ton of livestreaming apps. It seemed the guy was really bored in his spare time, either watching livestreams or writing a sequel to *Bai Jie*.\n\n\"Yeah, search for his ID, it's hilarious. I think he opened a spirit money shop in Rongcheng, but he hasn't streamed in a long time.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened an app and started searching for the old Daoist's ID as the girl suggested. He found a livestream room—*Host is not home*.\n\nBut fortunately, he could watch past recordings. Zhou Ze randomly clicked on a video from a month ago.\n\nIn the video, the old Daoist had his phone fixed in one position while he practiced boxing. His form was good; you could tell he was a trained practitioner. In the frame, a young man was sitting nearby, a smile on his lips, his eyes narrowed as if he were watching a monkey show.\n\nZhou Ze perfunctorily dragged the progress bar. Another man appeared in the frame, sitting behind the counter, holding a spoon, as if he were eating porridge.\n\nThe old Daoist was chattering away in the main frame, constantly promoting himself and the spirit money he sold on Taobao, but Zhou Ze's gaze was unconsciously drawn to the man in the corner of the video.\n\nHe was frowning, he was struggling, he was in pain, he was resisting.\n\nOne spoonful of porridge,\n\nhe ate it with great difficulty.\n\nThen he continued with the second spoonful,\n\nas if he were being tortured.\n\nWatching this, Zhou Ze took a deep breath, as if he himself had been infected by the man in the corner of the video.\n\nEating,\n\nwas really not an easy thing.\n\nHe didn't know the identity of the man in the video, but he felt a spontaneous flicker of interest. Was the other person an anorexia patient? Or did he have some kind of gastrointestinal disease?\n\nAfter the video finished, Zhou Ze opened the page. On a whim, he used Xu Le's logged-in account to send the old Daoist a private message:\n\n\"Who is the man sitting in the back eating porridge in the video?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm leaving. How much is it?\" The girl stood up and stretched. \"If I tell people about this, they'll definitely think I'm an idiot. Spending Valentine's Night sitting in a bookstore reading *Dream of the Red Chamber* for so long.\"\n\n\"Pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe customer had only read for a while and poured herself a cup of plain water.\n\nThe girl glanced at Zhou Ze. \"Owner, your method is pretty slick. Just like those masters in temples who interpret fortune sticks.\n\nThe sign by the prayer cushion says 'Free Fortune Stick Readings,' but after the tourist draws a stick and has it interpreted, the master pulls out a red donation book for you, with a long list of names and donation amounts, the lowest being a hundred.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, noncommittal.\n\nThe girl took out a hundred-yuan bill and placed it on the chair she had been sitting on. Then she picked up her Corgi, pushed open the bookstore door, and left.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, picked up the hundred-yuan bill, and flicked it with his fingers.\n\nA crisp snap.\n\nIt was one of the most wonderful sounds in the world.\n\nWhen he walked back to the counter, Zhou Ze noticed his phone screen had lit up. He opened it and saw there was a reply, a private message from the old Daoist. The reply was very simple:\n\n\"He's gone!\"",

    "content": "Just one customer the entire night. The total income was a hundred yuan, but the only cost was a glass of water.\n\nOf course, you could say there were also costs like electricity and rent...\n\nBut you can't look at it that way. When Xu Le was here, those were also costs, but his income was practically negligible. One has to find the right point of comparison to gain a shred of satisfaction and confidence in life.\n\nAlso, it was because of that girl with the corgi that Zhou Ze even realized today was Valentine's Day.\n\nHe scrolled through WeChat, found Dr. Lin's contact, and tapped on it. Zhou Ze wanted to send her a red envelope. He thought of sending 1314, but realized he didn't have enough money. He had enough for 131.4, but sending that amount felt a bit petty.\n\n*Anyway, she's not sleeping with me.*\n\n*Forget it.*\n\n*Not sending it.*\n\nTossing his phone aside, Zhou Ze randomly picked up a book and flipped through it, holding that pose until morning.\n\nHe went next door for wontons. Whether the wrappers were thin or the filling was generous, Zhou Ze couldn't tell. He ate them the same way as before: downing a large bowl of sour plum juice, immediately wolfing down the food, then clutching his own throat, taking deep breaths to suppress the urge to vomit.\n\nThe thought that every meal from now on would follow this procedure made Zhou Ze feel as if a shadow had been cast over all his days to come.\n\nZhou Ze thought of the man in the video who was also painfully drinking congee. He felt a wave of melancholy. Eating, originally one of life's greatest pleasures, was now lost to them.\n\nHe wondered if there was an \"Anorexics' Club\" somewhere in the world, where everyone would gather around a table, and whoever managed to eat a bite of food first would get a collective thumbs-up from the rest:\n\n\"You're so amazing!\n\nMy XXX is so incredible!\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. The image was somewhat chilling.\n\nIn any case, yesterday's video, including the old Taoist priest and the man drinking congee, felt too distant for Zhou Ze for the time being.\n\nAfter Valentine's Day came New Year's Eve. Normally, this commercial center would be decked out in lanterns and decorations, brimming with \"New Year's spirit,\" but now it remained the same as always, cold and deserted.\n\nIt was just like life.\n\nIf you've had your time in the limelight, you will naturally have your moments of desolation.\n\nZhou Ze remembered when this commercial center first opened, it was all the rage for a time. Now, it was completely ignored.\n\nXu Qinglang's business was good today, likely because many other shops were closed. Since he was still insisting on doing takeout on New Year's Eve, he naturally got more orders; after all, the customers' options had become much more limited.\n\nDelivery drivers in blue, yellow, or red uniforms constantly went in and out of his noodle shop. Zhou Ze squatted at the entrance of his own bookstore, smoking a cigarette and sighing with emotion.\n\n*That son-of-a-bitch Xu Le, why didn't he just open a Huang Men Ji Braised Chicken joint back then.*\n\nIn myths, immortals loved to say, \"A day in heaven is a year on earth.\"\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze felt this was probably true, and it applied equally to hell.\n\nHe remembered that when he died in the car crash... no, that's not right, when he was being sent into the incinerator to be cremated, it should have just been Children's Day on June 1st. And now, in the blink of an eye, it was New Year's Eve.\n\nMore than half a year had passed so quickly. Life is but a fleeting dream, nothing more than a dazed walk halfway down the road to the underworld.\n\nAfter smoking quite a few cigarettes and thinking quite a few thoughts, Zhou Ze felt a bit tired. He took out his phone, wanting to see what movies were playing recently. The cinema was right next door; he could go there to kill some time.\n\n\"Hey, you got any newspapers over there?\" Xu Qinglang asked as he came out after sending off the last batch of delivery drivers.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To paper the walls,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"That frugal?\"\n\n\"Newspaper on the walls gives it atmosphere, a sense of an older era. You didn't sell them all yesterday, did you?\"\n\n\"There are still some left. Wait, I'll go find them for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze went back into the shop, went upstairs, and from a box near his freezer, he carried out a stack of newspapers half a man's height. He went downstairs and gave them to Xu Qinglang, who was waiting there.\n\n\"You're not going home for the New Year either?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I'm spending the New Year with my books.\"\n\nIt was a pity Zhou Ze didn't have a goatee, nor any wine in his hand, otherwise, he would have deserved a large celebratory drink for that statement so full of swagger.\n\n\"You're not home either, are you?\" Zhou Ze asked after reveling in his own coolness for a moment.\n\n\"Twenty-something properties. Which home am I supposed to go back to?\" Xu Qinglang sighed.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two were silent for a moment, then Zhou Ze spoke up, \"Let me tell you a story.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, his expression slightly reserved. His hair was a little long, and a few strands drooped, brushing against the corner of his mouth. He reached up and gently pushed the hair away, a soft gesture that was truly bashful and charming.\n\nThis particular charm was not something for outsiders to comprehend.\n\n\"Once, it was also on New Year's Day, late at night on a road, a man ran into the richest man in the area.\n\n\"The rich man was dead drunk.\n\n\"The man asked the tycoon, 'Why don't you go home?'\n\n\"The tycoon replied, 'Home? Where is my home? My family and relatives aren't by my side. The home you speak of, is it that estate of mine, the largest in the city?'\"\n\nAfter hearing this story, Xu Qinglang nodded slightly, as if he deeply sympathized.\n\n\"Then, the man pinned the tycoon to the ground and beat him senseless, shouting:\n\n\"'That'll teach you to come out and be so damn pretentious on New Year's Eve!'\"\n\nZhou Ze finished the story.\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe conversation between the two ended.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore. The heat was on inside, making it warm and cozy. He fiddled with his phone, with no one to contact.\n\nHe thought about visiting the orphanage, but then decided against it. He didn't have much money left.\n\nBut just then, a customer arrived. It was a young man in blue work clothes and a safety helmet. He pushed open the bookstore door and walked in, asking somewhat timidly:\n\n\"Can I... read books here? How much is it?\" The man pursed his lips.\n\n\"Go ahead. Pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand, indicating the man could do as he pleased.\n\n\"That's great. Do you have any novels here?\" the young man said, a bit constrained. \"I like to read novels, the web novel kind.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a box behind a bookshelf. \"They're all over there.\"\n\nThe man walked over to the box and rummaged through it, looking very happy. It was just that some of the books were still in their plastic wrapping.\n\n\"Go ahead and open them. It's free,\" Zhou Ze said generously.\n\n\"Alrighty.\"\n\nThe young man unwrapped a web novel, then sat down on a plastic stool and started reading.\n\nAs the owner, Zhou Ze sat behind the counter trimming his fingernails. The young man just sat there reading. About half an hour later, the young man stood up from his stool, took out his cigarettes, and offered one to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"They're not great cigarettes, don't mind.\"\n\n\"Heh, cigarettes aren't good things to begin with, why distinguish between good and bad?\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette. The man took one for himself and proactively walked to the shop entrance, lighting up to smoke while being buffeted by the cold wind.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze, who had been planning to smoke inside, pause for a moment. He thought about it, then decided against it, putting the cigarette aside and continuing to trim his nails.\n\nAfter finishing his cigarette outside, the young man came back in. This time, he didn't sit on the plastic stool again but sat on the floor, leaning against the wall.\n\nEven though the air conditioner was on, the floor tiles were still very cold, but the young man didn't seem to mind at all, probably used to it from his daily life.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later, four more men in clean, well-washed blue work clothes walked up outside the shop. The oldest looked to be under thirty, and the youngest was maybe only seventeen or so.\n\nThe four of them came in together. The young man leaning against the wall waved at them; he must have been the one who called them over.\n\nThe newcomers greeted Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze gave a perfunctory response and continued trimming his nails.\n\nZhou Ze decided he needed to buy a professional manicure set. Only that would be worthy of his nails.\n\nBut deliveries had stopped for the holidays, and most of the physical stores outside were closed, so he had to put the thought on hold for now.\n\nWhen he looked up again, Zhou Ze saw that the five workers were all sitting on the floor, each holding a novel.\n\nYou could tell from the covers that they were all web novels, mostly of the fantasy genre. One was holding a horror novel, biting his nails as he read, clearly engrossed.\n\nIt was just that the man's nail-biting was a habit Zhou Ze couldn't quite approve of.\n\n*Only those who know how to cherish their nails know how to cherish life.*\n\nEvery so often, someone would laugh while reading their novel, a genuine laugh from the heart inspired by the story.\n\nThe bookstore was full of people, but it was quiet. There were occasional small noises, but they weren't disturbing.\n\nWhen evening came, Xu Qinglang walked in carrying a bowl of dumplings. As soon as he entered, he said:\n\n\"Yo, it's pretty lively in here.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Hey fellas, want something to eat?\" Xu Qinglang asked the workers sitting in the shop.\n\nThey all looked at each other, a bit at a loss.\n\n\"Forget it, my treat,\" Xu Qinglang said. He was, after all, a man with twenty-something properties. \"It's New Year's. It's not easy for you guys not to go home. We're all out here trying to make a living. We're brothers, no matter where we're from.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you, boss. May you get rich, boss,\" the oldest worker said, standing up to thank Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"It's my pleasure, my pleasure.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put down Zhou Ze's dumplings and went back to his own shop.\n\nZhou Ze drank a little of the soup, then forced down two dumplings. That damn Xu Qinglang had forgotten to bring him sour plum juice, so he couldn't eat.\n\nTaking out the cigarettes on the table, Zhou Ze walked out from behind the counter.\n\n\"Help yourselves to another when you're done. I should have the full sets of whatever I've got here. Anyway, this shop is a money-losing business, so don't be polite with me.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed out cigarettes one by one.\n\nThe workers accepted them, one by one, looking flattered.\n\nThen they all got up and walked to the shop entrance, squatting in a row to smoke.\n\nThey didn't want to make the shop dirty.\n\nZhou Ze thought for a moment, then also walked out of the shop. Outside, the wind was a bit cold. He squatted down next to them and smoked along.\n\nThe workers chatted among themselves.\n\nThe married ones talked about their wives and kids back home.\n\nThe unmarried ones talked about the girls they knew in Tongcheng or their hometowns.\n\nThey teased each other, joked with each other.\n\nEven though they all knew each other's situations, there was still plenty to talk about.\n\nYou could tell from their accents that this group of workers came from all over the country, not from the same village.\n\nTongcheng is near Shanghai, part of the Yangtze River Delta region. Although it can't compare to Shanghai's scale, the demand for labor here is huge every year. As long as you're willing to work hard, you won't have trouble finding a job or making money.\n\nThey went through two more rounds of cigarettes.\n\nZhou Ze spoke up, \"Fellas, are you really not going home for the New Year?\"\n\n\"Nah, everyone at home is fine.\"\n\n\"It's a lot of trouble going back and forth. There's work during the first month of the lunar year, and the boss will even give out red envelopes. Be a fool not to take 'em. Plus, we can send more money home.\"\n\n\"Haha, today was great. Got novels to read, cigarettes to smoke. This New Year's has some flavor to it.\"\n\n\"Boss, when are you closing?\" one of the workers asked.\n\n\"Not closing,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Boss isn't going home?\"\n\n\"The missus at home won't behave, so I'm not going back.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a surge of heroic spirit rising to the heavens!\n\nThe workers all gave Zhou Ze a thumbs-up in applause.\n\nOf course, no one chimed in too much. They could tell from his accent, and the fact that Zhou Ze ran a bookstore, not a fruit stall, that he was a local.\n\nA local man guarding his shop on New Year's Eve instead of going home must have his reasons, so they didn't continue to joke or tease him about it.\n\nBesides, they were each the pillar of their own families, out here working to earn money. Their wives were at home managing the elderly and the children. They worked hard, they were tired, but their wives were just the same.\n\nLife is built on generations of hardship and endurance. Whose life is ever easy?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to pass out more cigarettes, a voice called from a distance:\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up, stood up, and only then did he notice a Porsche Cayenne parked on the opposite side of the road. A familiar car.\n\nAh, his wife's car.\n\nThe one who shouted was his sister-in-law. She had indeed been terrified by Zhou Ze in the bathroom a while back, but she was back to normal now. She couldn't possibly believe her brother-in-law was a ghost, so she just attributed it to her eyes playing tricks on her back then because she was so scared.\n\nOf course, she couldn't possibly be in a good mood with Zhou Ze. After all, he had scared her so badly she'd wet herself. How embarrassing!\n\n\"Xu Le, come home for dinner!\" the sister-in-law shouted.\n\n\"Not going back. The shop's busy, and it's lively here,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\n*What a joke.*\n\n*Go back on New Year's Eve to see that pair of坑爹(kēng diē)¹ in-laws?*\n\n*Put up with the attitude of this bratty sister-in-law?*\n\n*Most importantly,*\n\n*Rush home on New Year's Eve just to sleep in separate beds?*\n\n*Am I a masochist?*\n\n\"Sis, is this guy nuts? He's unreasonable, just plain weird, and so stubborn!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law pouted from the back seat.\n\nDr. Lin smiled. \"Let's go home and have dinner with Mom and Dad first.\"\n\n\"Ooh, hearing that, does that mean you plan on coming out tonight, Sis?\"\n\n\"I am, after all, his legal wife.\" Dr. Lin said no more, started the car, and drove away.\n\nWatching the car leave, Zhou Ze shouted to the workers beside him, \"Fellas, isn't my wife pretty?\"\n\n\"Pretty!\"\n\n\"You're a lucky man!\"\n\n\"Gorgeous!\"\n\n\"Hahahaha.\"\n\nXu Qinglang came out of his shop carrying a large tray.\n\n\"Here we go, braised pork over rice! Fellas, dig in!\"\n\nThe workers were a bit reserved and conflicted. The oldest worker said, a little embarrassed, \"We came out without bringing any...\"\n\n\"We agreed earlier, it's my treat for my brothers! If you mention money again, you're not treating me as a brother. We're from all over, who knows when we might run into each other again. There might be a day when I need to ask you guys for a favor.\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\n\"Say no more!\"\n\n\"When you come to my hometown...\"\n\n\"Let's eat!\"\n\nThe workers all took a large bowl of rice with topping and went into the bookstore. They all squatted on the floor, placing their bowls on the plastic stools, and started eating with gusto.\n\nOne worker was eating and reading his novel at the same time and got a tap on the head with a pair of chopsticks from the worker next to him.\n\n\"You fool, your heart's been clouded by lard. If you get the book dirty, how is the boss supposed to sell it?\"\n\n\"Right, eat first.\"\n\nThe atmosphere was lively. Zhou Ze went back behind his counter. He ate three more of the now somewhat cold dumplings. This time, he didn't know why, maybe it was the atmosphere, but his nausea was much less than before.\n\nAfter the meal, the group continued to read.\n\nInside, there was heating, and there were novels to read. It was very harmonious.\n\nWithout realizing it, it was ten o'clock at night.\n\nThe oldest worker stood up, stretched, and said, \"Fellas, it's time. Let's go back. Let's help him clean up the place first.\"\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\nThe five workers helped Zhou Ze clean the shop from top to bottom.\n\n\"Boss, we're leaving now. Thanks for today.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" Zhou Ze waved.\n\nThey left.\n\nUnlike the girl with the corgi last night, who left a hundred-yuan bill after reading for a while, they had read for a whole day and half the night and didn't leave a single yuan behind.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't mind at all, nor did he feel the slightest bit of dissatisfaction.\n\nStretching, Zhou Ze was about to call Xu Qinglang to come collect the bowls and chopsticks from his shop. When he walked over to the noodle shop, Zhou Ze saw Xu Qinglang sitting behind a table, reading a newspaper.\n\nHm, it was the newspaper Zhou Ze had given him during the day.\n\nXu Qinglang was wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, and he did indeed have a bit of a scholarly air about him. A man with twenty-something properties, as expected.\n\nHe had class no matter how you looked at him!\n\n\"The bowls and chopsticks over there, you can clear them,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay, I'll go right now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and got up to go next door to collect the tableware.\n\nOn top of the large stack of newspapers was a copy of the Yangzi Evening News. Judging by the date, it was from seven days ago.\n\nOn the front page was a headline in large, bold black type:\n\n**\"Apartment Building Fire, A Moving Tale of Heroism\"**\n\nLast week, a fire broke out in a densely populated residential complex in Tongcheng. The fire was severe.\n\nFive young construction workers from a nearby site rushed into the building to save people without regard for their own safety. They rescued over twenty elderly people, women, and children in total. But after they rushed into the fire one last time to save someone,\n\nthey never came back out.\n\nThe front page of the Yangzi Evening News had a large photograph.\n\nIt was a group photo of the five men.\n\nThey were standing shoulder to shoulder, making old-fashioned peace signs. It seemed to be a photo taken together in their shared dorm when they first arrived at the construction site.\n\nTheir faces were youthful but also bore a hint of weathered wrinkles.\n\nIn the photo,\n\nthey were smiling, a bit shyly, but also brilliantly.\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the bookstore.\n\nHe looked at the five bowls of rice with topping placed on the plastic stools before him.\n\nNot a single bite had been taken. The food had long since gone cold.\n\nIn each bowl of rice, a pair of chopsticks was stuck straight up.²\n\n\"Fellas,\"\n\n\"Eat well,\"\n\n\"Drink well,\"\n\nXu Qinglang murmured.\n\nOutside, the sound of firecrackers erupted.\n\nFireworks weren't banned in Tongcheng. For a moment, the sky was filled with colorful light, very lively and festive.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head and looked outside.\n\nHe said in a low voice:\n\n\"So, it's the New Year.\"\n\n---\n¹ `坑爹` (kēng diē) is a popular slang term meaning \"screwed over,\" \"rip-off,\" or something that is frustratingly disappointing. Literally \"to cheat one's own father.\"\n\n² Sticking chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a traditional way to make an offering to the deceased and is considered a major taboo during a regular meal, as it resembles incense sticks burned at a grave or altar.",

    "content": "The sound of firecrackers bid farewell to the old year. After midnight, the pops and bangs of fireworks erupted from all directions, exceptionally lively and dense. What had been sporadic sounds now took on an overwhelming, deafening quality.\n\nZhou Ze blew on his fingernails. The clamor outside had little to do with him. He had no home—although nominally, he now had a \"home,\" he didn't want to go back.\n\nMany people have had the thought at some point in their lives that if they could be reborn, they would do this or that.\n\n*To inspire with powerful words, to command the world with a flourish, dismissing the nobles of old as mere dirt.¹*\n\nBut when you truly return from hell, you suddenly discover that your former pursuits, your former ideas, your former aspirations, are like when a kindergarten teacher asks, \"Children, what do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\nAnd all the children answer together: \"Scientists, doctors, astronauts, soldiers...\"\n\nDreams are always full-bodied.\n\nAnd reality, while not exactly skeletal, means that a person's rush of excitement is bound to be finite.\n\nSometimes, just being able to breathe, to hear sounds, to sit here and slack off, to waste a bit of time...\n\nPerhaps this is what it truly means for the years to be quiet and good.\n\nXu Qinglang was sleeping in the shop again tonight. Zhou Ze heard him lock the front door.\n\nHe claimed to have over twenty properties, but Zhou Ze knew his parents were right there in the shop.\n\nA family has to be together, all neat and tidy.\n\nThis New Year was, naturally, even more important.\n\nOutside, it began to rain. A damp chill started to seep in, creating a somewhat oppressive feeling.\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang. It was a call from his wife.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\nZhou Ze thought this was a moronic question.\n\n*If I were asleep, who would be answering your call?*\n\n*A dead person... oh, wait, a ghost?²*\n\n*No, wait, there's something to that.*\n\nZhou Ze leaned back slightly in his chair. In his mind, an image formed of Doctor Lin gently poking his chest and calling him, \"You devil...\"\n\nFor the first time, he felt—in all honesty—how could the plain truth be so dizzyingly sublime.\n\nPerhaps he was just too bored, or maybe it was pure idleness, but Zhou Ze found his thoughts starting to wander.\n\nHe was thinking... a bit too much.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n*Creak...*\n\nDoctor Lin pushed open the shop door and walked in. She held a red umbrella, dressed in leather pants and a white sweater, her hair draped over her shoulders.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze forgot to hang up the phone.\n\nThis woman...\n\n...was indeed very beautiful.\n\nEspecially her aura, which always gave you that feeling of \"if life were only like our first meeting,\" instantly piercing a man's heart.\n\n\"Afraid I'd be lonely and cold all by myself?\" Zhou Ze stood up and poured Doctor Lin a glass of water.\n\nShe was the mistress of this place.\n\nWell,\n\nTo be precise, the money Xu Le used to open this bookstore had come from her family.\n\nDoctor Lin took the water, shook her head, and said nothing.\n\nThe two of them were husband and wife, but in reality, they were like the most familiar of strangers, stuck in a position more awkward than that of a male confidant.\n\nTaking a step forward was difficult.\n\nTaking a step back was even harder.\n\n\"Let's go for a walk,\" Zhou Ze said, feeling the room was a bit stuffy. Besides, there was no way he could invite Doctor Lin up to his sleeping quarters on the second floor.\n\nEven if Doctor Lin had taken the wrong medicine today and decided to offer herself to the tiger, the sight of his freezer on the second floor would probably make her immediately call the number of a familiar psychiatric hospital to have him sent away for some serious rehabilitation.\n\n\"It's raining,\" said Doctor Lin.\n\n\"It's a light rain, it's fine,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand, nonchalant and relaxed.\n\n...\n\n*Whoosh...*\n\nThe rain got heavier. Much heavier.\n\nZhou Ze, who hadn't even bothered to grab an umbrella, wanting to experience the \"precious spring rain,\" was soaked to the bone. Doctor Lin stood to the side, still holding her umbrella. Zhou Ze had refused her offer to share it.\n\nThe badass act he put on, he had to see it through, even with tears in his eyes.\n\nPatting his soaking wet hair, Zhou Ze shivered. He wasn't particularly afraid of the cold; he was actually quite resistant to it. It was just that the woman beside him, despite being mostly dry under her umbrella, was still trembling slightly.\n\nThe bus stop shelter could block most of the rain,\n\nbut the cold night wind still blew through with impunity.\n\nA touch of bourgeois sentiment,\n\na man and a woman together,\n\na rain-soaked night,\n\na beauty inspiring pity...\n\nThis should have been a good opportunity, a perfect catalyst for them to cultivate their feelings. Hell, sparks flying, a \"mistake in the flower fields,\"³ and even a one-shot pregnancy were all possibilities, but the two stood in relative silence.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. Doctor Lin stood beside him.\n\nOne wanted to escape, the other was inherently resistant; naturally, they couldn't meet in the middle.\n\nWhen you force a melon off the vine, both the melon and the vine feel awkward.\n\nIn his heart, Zhou Ze grumbled a bit at Xu Le. If that wimp had just forced the issue after they got married, none of this mess would be happening now. Even as a married woman or with a child, Doctor Lin would probably still be devastatingly beautiful, maybe even scoring some extra points.\n\nAnd he could have just gone with the flow, instead of being stuck in this dilemma.\n\nOf course, this complaint was rather unfair to Xu Le. If Zhou Ze himself had forced the issue that night, would Doctor Lin have fought back desperately, screaming \"indecent assault\"? And then called the police to have Zhou Ze sent to the Public Security Bureau? Accuse him of rape?\n\nThe rain was still falling.\n\nZhou Ze dropped his cigarette butt on the ground.\n\n\"Did you drive here?\"\n\n\"I took a taxi,\" Doctor Lin answered.\n\n\"I'll see you home.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThere was no need to dwell on how this seemingly foolish and naive New Year's Eve stroll had started.\n\nAt least, for now, both of them felt that ending it was the most appropriate course of action.\n\nHailing a ride-share car, Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin got in together.\n\nFifteen minutes later, they arrived. Zhou Ze got out with Doctor Lin. The driver closed out the trip and drove off immediately.\n\nHome was just upstairs, but Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin didn't go straight up.\n\nThe scene was a bit like a pair of junior high sweethearts walking the girl home at night. Now below her apartment, it was time to part, a moment for clinging affection and sweet nothings.\n\nBut the atmosphere here was even less charged than that of awkward middle schoolers. It was like meat broth without salt or MSG—tasteless to eat, but a waste to throw out.\n\n\"You're not coming up?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"No. Let's wait a bit longer, and then we'll... take care of our business.\"\n\nDoctor Lin understood Zhou Ze's unspoken meaning. \"I'm sorry,\" she said.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, then raised his hand. He had intended to pat her on the shoulder, but after his hand landed, he suddenly felt an impulse and pulled her into a hug instead.\n\nDoctor Lin's body stiffened for a moment, but she didn't resist.\n\nThey drew slightly closer, but it wasn't a particularly intimate gesture. Considering their relationship, it could even be called distant.\n\nShe smelled nice. He wondered what kind of shower gel she used. In any case, it was a pleasant scent.\n\n\"I've always been curious about something. Is there someone else in your heart?\" Zhou Ze added, \"And that 'someone' could be a man or a woman.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Doctor Lin said, very frank. She didn't even hesitate.\n\nBefore, her husband had been so timid and shrinking, she couldn't bear to hurt him.\n\nNow, her husband seemed like a different person, which allowed her to shed some of her burdens.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze grunted, his gaze shifting slightly upward, as if to check whether a certain protective coloration had appeared above his head.⁴\n\nHe was still a little disappointed.\n\nHe couldn't say it was love.\n\nHe couldn't say he liked her all that much.\n\nHe could barely even say they were familiar.\n\nBut she was, no matter what, nominally his woman. And yet, he'd still been cuckolded.\n\nYeah, any man...\n\nNo,\n\nany male of any species...\n\n...would probably not be too happy about this sort of thing.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" This was her second apology.\n\nZhou Ze released his hands, and they slowly separated.\n\n\"Saying sorry makes us sound like strangers,\" Zhou Ze said, leaning back against a stone bollard. The rain had lessened, and there was a small eave here.\n\n\"I'll give you another sum of money. You can open another bookstore,\" Doctor Lin said, then added another, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to magnanimously wave his hand and say, \"I don't care about the money.\"\n\nBut then he thought about his freezer, about his future life...\n\nZhou Ze suddenly found he couldn't get the words out.\n\nWhat if...\n\nWhat if...\n\nWhat if this woman took him seriously, thought giving him money was an insult, and then really didn't give him any compensation?\n\n\"Let's talk in a few days,\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"So, that guy, what's he like?\"\n\n\"He's very handsome, in my opinion,\" Doctor Lin replied.\n\n*So it's a man.*\n\n*Stab.*\n\n*Another knife wound.*\n\n*It would have been easier to accept if it were a woman...*\n\nZhou Ze felt the intensity of the photosynthesis happening above his head grow even stronger.\n\n\"So there's no chance, is there?\" Zhou Ze asked a very stupid question. He regretted it the moment it left his mouth but consoled himself, *I'm asking for poor Xu Le.*\n\n*You've taken over the guy's body. Now that his wife is cheating on him, you have to at least help him ask why, right?*\n\n*Yes, that's it.*\n\n\"No chance,\" Doctor Lin's reply was just as swift and certain.\n\nThis woman was also a surgeon. Her style of speaking was truly decisive, like wielding a scalpel—every cut hit a vital point, no dawdling.\n\nOtherwise, the patient suffers more. The same principle seemed to apply to matters of the heart.\n\n\"Fine, fine. I can't compare, I can't compare. It's fine. We'll each live our own lives. You go on up and deal with your parents,\" Zhou Ze said, feeling annoyed.\n\nDoctor Lin nodded and turned to enter the building.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, ready to call a taxi to leave, when at that moment, an unknown number called him:\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Sir, I've driven back.\"\n\n\"So smart?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised. He recognized the voice of the previous driver.\n\n\"You two left a bag on the back seat. I brought it back for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\nThe car drove back up to the apartment building. From the window, the driver handed out a woman's handbag.\n\n\"Please check it.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony. He opened Doctor Lin's bag. Inside was just a phone, a wallet, a charging cable, and a few packs of tissues.\n\nTaking out the wallet, Zhou Ze froze as soon as he opened it.\n\nHis gaze was fixed on the photo slot in the wallet.\n\nThere was a picture there.\n\nThe woman in the photo looked very young, even... naive, wearing an ill-fitting white doctor's coat.\n\nAnd the man to the girl's right... Zhou Ze felt a strange sense of familiarity.\n\nHe stared for a good while.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze recognize him.\n\n*Isn't that... me?*\n\nIt was a cropped photo, probably cut from a group picture, but trimmed to show just the two of them.\n\n\"Is anything missing?\" the driver prompted.\n\n\"It's all here. Thanks, master driver. You can go.\"\n\nThe driver drove away.\n\nZhou Ze continued to stare at the wallet, not even thinking that he should call Doctor Lin to come down and get her bag.\n\nSome memories, not exactly buried but not often considered, began to surface.\n\nHe vaguely remembered...\n\n...that five or six years ago, he had supervised a group of students assigned from the university for their internship. There was one girl, he thought her surname was Lin, and her appearance seemed to match the girl in the photo.\n\nA girl really does change so much as she grows up.\n\nA smile crept onto Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nTo think Doctor Lin had such an adorkable phase back then. Who knew she would turn out so stunning five or six years later? He really hadn't noticed this girl's glow-up potential at all.\n\nMoreover, he had been very perfunctory about supervising the interns the hospital assigned him back then, using the students purely as \"medical grunts.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook the wallet in his hand.\n\n\"Damn it, serves you right for being single until you were almost thirty.\"\n\nThis time, surprisingly, he wasn't cursing Xu Le.\n\nHe was cursing himself.\n\n\"Your eyes...\n\n...were truly blind...\"\n\nZhou Ze spread his arms and stretched.\n\nThe one who cuckolded him...\n\n...was actually himself.\n\nIn the early morning after the rain, on the first day of the New Year...\n\nHeh heh.\n\nHe looked up at the sky.\n\nHe very solemnly patted himself on the chest.\n\nZhou Ze paused.\n\nAnd said, very seriously:\n\n\"Xu Le, you truly are my good brother!\n\n*Your wife, I shall care for myself. You need not worry.*\"⁵\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  A line from a famous poem by Mao Zedong, expressing grand, revolutionary ambition.\n2.  The term `死鬼` (sǐ guǐ) literally means \"dead ghost\" but is also a common, flirtatious term a woman might use for her husband or lover, akin to \"you scoundrel\" or \"you devil.\" Zhou Ze is playing on this double meaning.\n3.  `花田裡犯的錯` (\"a mistake made in a field of flowers\") is a poetic Chinese euphemism for a sexual transgression or affair.\n4.  In Chinese culture, `戴綠帽子` (\"wearing a green hat\") is the common slang for being cuckolded. Zhou Ze is sarcastically wondering if he's literally turning green.\n5.  A famous, darkly humorous quote from the classic novel *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*.

    "content": "The air was still thick with the lingering smell of fireworks and firecrackers. It was a bit acrid, but this seemed to be the proper smell of the New Year—what's commonly known as the \"New Year's flavor.\"\n\nEspecially for the Zhou Ze of this moment, life seemed to have gained another touch of beauty.\n\nIt wasn't some romance of eternal vows, nor was it as dramatic as \"until the mountains crumble and heaven and earth merge.\"\n\nIt was simply like a child who normally had no pocket money finding a ten-yuan bill on the street, with no police officer passing by, but a convenience store right around the corner.\n\nTo have walked through hell and returned in a different body... even now, there were still many troubles, both discovered and undiscovered, that needed solving. His own personality had also undergone a significant, unwitting change.\n\nHe thought back to himself in his previous life. After leaving the orphanage, his mind was filled with nothing but climbing the ladder step by step with his own two hands and abilities. In hindsight, the reason he had overlooked Dr. Lin back then was probably not because of how dorky or plain she was five years ago. A young girl at that age should have been full of romantic daydreams; otherwise, she wouldn't have cropped that photo and kept it in her wallet.\n\nIt was just a pity that the him of that time had neither the energy nor the inclination to glance at the scenery along the way. His obsession was too strong, a bitter and resentful man who postured as if he were so damn impressive, acting like a stream of untainted purity.\n\nUnlike now. Having died once and come back, he instead felt a kind of carefree relief and melancholy, like one who is \"unburdened by office.\"\n\nBut no matter what,\n\nthe feeling of being secretly loved, even a \"love you 'til I die\" kind of feeling,\n\nwas indeed quite nice.\n\nHe made the call, and Dr. Lin came down again. She seemed to be in a hurry. She took her handbag from Zhou Ze's hands, smiled, and didn't say thank you. Given their current relationship, saying \"thank you\" was even more inappropriate than saying \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nWith a wave of her hand,\n\nZhou Ze left her with a view of his back,\n\nheading home to sleep,\n\nand then to wait for tomorrow. Tomorrow would be better.\n\nDr. Lin felt that her husband's mood seemed to have changed slightly, as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders.\n\nPerhaps it was a good thing that they could both move on.\n\nRather than awkwardly staying tangled up together, it was better to part ways freely and face their own lives anew.\n\nOne could only chalk it up to the unpredictability of life. Dr. Lin could never have imagined that the shell of her husband was now inhabited by another soul.\n\nThe soul of the man she had harbored a tender,懵懂 crush on back when she was just an intern.\n\nZhou Ze hailed another car, then squatted by the residential complex gate, smoking. His phone screen continuously showed that it was searching for a ride. Zhou Ze felt a pang of regret. Why did he let that driver go? He should have asked him to wait so he could take his car back to the bookstore.\n\nAnd now look at him,\n\non the night of New Year's Eve,\n\nit really was hard to get a car.\n\nAfter waiting for about ten minutes and smoking three cigarettes, Zhou Ze grew restless. He stood up and stretched.\n\nAlthough he wasn't particularly afraid of the cold, walking all the way back would be exhausting.\n\nJust then, a black sedan drove toward him on the road ahead. As it passed Zhou Ze, it slowed down.\n\n\"Need a ride?\" The driver stuck his head out the window. He had a big, round face, was middle-aged and unshaven, and wore a black cotton-padded jacket.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Zhou Ze had no other choice.\n\n\"Hop in. I won't overcharge you,\" the driver said with a smile.\n\nZhou Ze got in the car, gave him the bookstore's location, and they settled on a price. The driver started the car again.\n\nThe car must have been new. The seat cushions still smelled of plastic and leather, and the interior was very clean.\n\nGenerally speaking, very few people were willing to use a new car as a taxi.\n\n\"That place is pretty remote,\" the driver said, proactively offering Zhou Ze a cigarette. Zhou Ze accepted it.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"You live there?\"\n\n\"My shop is there.\"\n\n\"Oh. Business can't be good then, huh?\" Everyone knew that commercial center had been dead for ages and had no foot traffic.\n\n\"You're not from around here?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe local Tongcheng dialect was very different from others, almost like a separate language from Mandarin, making it easy to spot.\n\n\"I'm from Rongcheng. I work here.\" The driver lit his cigarette. \"Go on, smoke up. Don't be a stranger.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit his cigarette as well, took a puff, and frowned slightly. The tobacco flavor was incredibly weak.\n\n\"Not going home for the New Year?\"\n\n\"Wife and kids are at home, no problems there. Not going back. Figured I'd earn a bit more money.\" The driver stuck his hand out the window and flicked his ash. \"I've got four kids.\"\n\n\"That's impressive,\" Zhou Ze said admiringly.\n\n\"It's tough, too.\" The driver smacked his lips. \"My wife's first was a boy, and the second was a boy, too. I really wanted a daughter, but then the third was another boy. Luckily, the fourth was finally a girl. I'm satisfied now.\"\n\n\"Nice,\" Zhou Ze chimed in. He took another drag of the cigarette, then tossed it out the window. It was so bland it was like smoking a roll of paper.\n\n\"I'm not some old-fashioned guy, not sexist or anything. I just like kids, wanted to have a few more, haha.\" The driver became more talkative when the subject turned to his children.\n\n\"Still haven't paid the fine for the youngest. When it's time for her to start school, I'll pay the money and get her household registration sorted. By the way, what kind of shop do you run?\"\n\n\"A bookstore.\"\n\n\"How's business?\" The driver had a knack for touching a sore spot.\n\n\"Not great.\"\n\n\"Right. You can buy books online these days, and with coupons, too.\"\n\nUp ahead, there was a car accident. Traffic police had set up a roadblock, and the original four lanes were now down to one. Fortunately, there weren't many cars on the road late on New Year's Eve, so it probably wouldn't cause much of a delay.\n\n\"Getting into a fender-bender on New Year's. Talk about bad luck,\" the driver said, exhaling a smoke ring. He spoke with a critical tone, like a manager.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back, shifting into a more comfortable position, and asked,\n\n\"Is this a new car?\"\n\n\"Yeah. My son gave it to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"How old are you? How old is your son?\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The driver's eyes narrowed into slits. \"My son's got promise. These days, ambition has nothing to do with age. As long as you've got hands, feet, and a brain, and your fate isn't just one stroke of bad luck after another, how can you stay poor?\"\n\n\"That's the truth,\" Zhou Ze nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Beep... Beep...\"\n\nA car behind them seemed to be in a hurry to get home, honking its horn frequently, urging the cars ahead to get a move on.\n\n\"Hurry, hurry, hurry. In a hurry to see a ghost?\"\n\nThe driver had a bit of a dramatic streak. He leaned out of the car again and yelled at the car behind him.\n\nBut the cars behind them only honked more frequently, as if in deliberate defiance.\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nThe driver made a show of pushing his door open, ready to get out and have a proper discussion.\n\nJust then, the traffic police officer directing traffic gestured for their lane to pass through quickly. The driver sheepishly sat back down, started the car, and drove past.\n\n\"Business is tough today,\" the driver began to lament again. \"Should've just gone home to see my wife and kids.\"\n\n\"It's alright, I suppose,\" Zhou Ze said noncommittally. He had noticed that the noodle shop next door was doing decent business. With most competitors closed for the holiday, even if demand was lower during the New Year period, there was still more business to go around than usual.\n\nEspecially since Zhou Ze himself had just waited so long for a ride with no one accepting his request.\n\n\"Nah, it's not good.\" The driver shook his head again. \"I don't dare take a break. The kids' school fees, I have to send money home every month. I work my day job, then drive for half the night. This life, it's pretty dull. I can't even bear to smoke a decent pack of cigarettes.\"\n\n*This cigarette of yours... seems fake,* Zhou Ze thought.\n\nHe took out his own pack, pulled one out, and fiddled with it in his hand.\n\n\"But it's okay. The internet is convenient now. At night, before I go to sleep, I can video chat with my wife and kids. That's pretty good. I get to see them.\" A look of relief appeared on the driver's face.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes slightly. He couldn't sleep, but at that moment, he didn't feel like talking or chatting.\n\nBut even without Zhou Ze's feedback or reaction, the driver continued talking. It was New Year's, and he was \"alone in a strange land, a lonely traveler\"; of course he was lonely.\n\nFrom naming his children to their schools, to his own parents, to the local customs of his village, the driver rambled on.\n\nIn the end, Zhou Ze just rested his forehead against the car window and urged, \"Driver, can you go a little faster?\"\n\nThis driver was going incredibly slow, maybe thirty miles an hour.\n\nAnd this was an elevated highway.\n\nZhou Ze even started to suspect the man was just lonely and was deliberately driving slowly to have someone to talk to, but Zhou Ze had no interest in being his confidante.\n\n\"Heh heh, new car. Haven't gotten used to it yet. Don't dare to drive too fast,\" the driver said, stroking the steering wheel fondly. \"This car isn't worth much, it's actually pretty cheap, but it's a gift from my eldest son. I have to treasure it and take good care of it.\n\n\"I plan to use this car to earn money for a few years. When my eldest son finds a girlfriend, I'll get him a down payment for an apartment. Get one settled, then worry about the next. I don't want the older ones to have to raise the younger ones. That's not fair to them. After all, the one who decided to have them was me, their father. As long as I can still work, still hold down a job, I have to grit my teeth and bear it. I'm not an irresponsible person. I wouldn't do something like have kids and not raise them.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nHe was getting annoyed.\n\nHe lit one of his own cigarettes and took a drag.\n\n\"Driver, seriously, I'm begging you, please go faster.\" Zhou Ze was starting to miss his ice coffin. He also regretted not asking Dr. Lin to just drive him back.\n\n\"Don't be in such a hurry, young man. It's New Year's. It's fate that brought us together, right? No need to rush. I get it, I get it. I'm an experienced driver...\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash,\n\nand accidentally missed the window.\n\nA bit of ash landed on the inside of the car door.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nthe spot on the inner door was burned through by the ash, leaving a hole.\n\nA hole the size of a thumb.\n\nThe cold wind from outside whistled incessantly through the small hole.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **懵懂 (měng dǒng):** This describes a state of being naive, muddled, or uncomprehending, often due to youth. A \"tender,懵懂crush\" implies a young, innocent, and perhaps not fully understood infatuation.\n2.  **三十邁 (sān shí mài):** \"邁 (mài)\" is a loanword from the English \"mile,\" but in modern colloquial Chinese, it's often used to mean \"kilometers per hour.\" Regardless of the unit, the context makes it clear that 30 is extremely slow for a highway.

    "content": "For those who don't know cars, buying one is a huge headache. You can't avoid consulting friends or relatives who know their stuff. After all, some cars really do have their drawbacks, and might have some problems, like with quality, or with performance.\n\nBut when all is said and done,\n\na car door you can burn a hole through with a cigarette butt,\n\ncan no longer be brushed off as just having \"quality issues,\" can it?\n\nAll of this points to one thing,\n\nThis is a,\n\npaper car!\n\nThe driver was middle-aged, but his eldest son was probably only elementary school-aged. That's why the driver said his son had *sent* him this car.\n\nActually, the \"sent\" here,¹\n\ncould also be written as \"burned.\"\n\nThe father died,\n\nand the son burned a paper car for him.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. To be honest, he really hadn't noticed beforehand. It was only after getting in the car that he belatedly sensed something was off, but he still wanted to play dumb.\n\nHe himself was a stowaway, and he had no grand ambition to be a Master Zhang.²\n\nAt the end of the day, he was a ghost too.\n\nIf he were to take up the banner of slaying demons and defending the righteous, he'd be no different from a collaborator—a \"ghost traitor.\"\n\nHe pressed his palm over the small hole to cover it. Feigning drowsiness, Zhou Ze half-closed his eyes, pretending that nothing had happened.\n\nZhou Ze remembered when he was in the orphanage, there was a teacher who usually led everyone in gym activities and also had a part-time job—manning the main gate.\n\nAnd because his surname was Qin, the children at the time called him—Old Man Qin the Gatekeeper.\n\nOld Man Qin was a great storyteller, often telling ghost stories. He seemed to take great satisfaction in the fearful expressions on the children's faces when they heard his tales. The orphanage director spoke to him about it several times, but he didn't tone it down.\n\nBut just before Zhou Ze left the orphanage to attend school elsewhere, Old Man Qin passed away from a heart attack.\n\nZhou Ze remembered a ghost story Old Man Qin had once told, called \"Ghosts Carrying a Sedan Chair.\"\n\nLegend had it that in ancient times, there were many different kinds of ghosts. After most people died, they went directly down to the underworld, entered the Yellow Springs, drank Meng Po's soup of oblivion, and then re-entered the cycle of reincarnation. Very few ghosts could remain in the mortal world.\n\nBut some ghosts did stay. They might have known they were dead, or they might not have, but regardless, they might still be doing what they did in life.\n\nFor example, sedan bearers.\n\nThey would appear on deserted roads or late at night, asking people if they wanted a ride in a sedan, setting the price extremely low. Once the person was seated and had reached their destination, the transaction would be complete.\n\nBut for a living person to do business with a ghost and enjoy a service provided by a ghost was never going to be that simple. When ghosts carry a sedan, what they want isn't that vulgar stuff called money, but your lifespan, or perhaps your essence and spirit.\n\nIn the underworld, ghosts carry sedans for figures like King Yama. What status does a living person have? Are they worthy?\n\nIt’s like if an eighty-year-old man knelt before you; it would shorten your lifespan.\n\nZhou Ze remembered this story, and very clearly. In fact, Zhou Ze still remembered many of the stories Old Man Qin told, and he hadn't forgotten them even after growing up and starting work.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze knew that on the day before Old Man Qin's sudden death from illness, Old Man Qin, who usually only guarded the main gate and never entered the back courtyard, made an exception and walked into the children's dormitories, looking into room after room, looking at each and every child. Zhou Ze happened to be awake at the time and witnessed it.\n\nIt seemed as though Old Man Qin knew his time was up and had come to say a final farewell.\n\nJust like how even a fart from Warren Buffett can make people think it contains some great secret to wealth,\n\nthe ghost stories told by a man who knew he was probably going to GG tomorrow couldn't really be treated as mere tall tales.\n\nThe driver was still rambling on, continuing to brag. Zhou Ze remained calm in the back.\n\nShorten his lifespan?\n\nDrain his essence and spirit?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't very afraid. He wasn't a living person; he was a ghost too.\n\nTo put it bluntly, although Zhou Ze didn't understand the hierarchy and class divisions of ghosts, the fact that he could walk under the sun, meet living people, and run a business should mean he was a much higher grade than the lone wandering spirits outside, right?\n\nBesides, even the faceless woman in the Hell's Pool could be injured by his fingernails. When facing other ghostly beings, Zhou Ze actually felt quite confident.\n\n\"These days, more and more people are buying and driving cars, and more and more people don't follow the rules,\" the driver continued to chat. Even though Zhou Ze didn't chime in or respond, he could still carry on the conversation by himself.\n\n\"When the forest gets bigger, you get all kinds of birds. Anyway, if you really let every single one of them get to you, you'd really lose a good many years off your life.\n\nEven though you know in your heart you shouldn't get angry, some people go out with a sign practically pasted on their foreheads that says, 'Hit me, why don't you? Go on, hit me!' It's really infuriating.\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed. He felt a bit sleepy, even wanting to fall asleep.\n\nBut he knew that he was incapable of sleep, and therefore, this clear sensation he was feeling now must be fake.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly let out a silent laugh.\n\nHe understood why this driver had been chattering nonstop the whole way. It wasn't that he didn't know he was being annoying,\n\nit was because Zhou Ze hadn't fallen asleep, so he had to keep talking to pretend everything was normal.\n\nHe wanted him to fall asleep,\n\nand Zhou Ze's reaction to sleep-inducing effects had always been very slow.\n\nA smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth. He placed his hand on the car seat and closed his eyes.\n\n*Sleep, then.*\n\nThe car began to slow down.\n\nThe driver's voice also grew softer and softer as Zhou Ze \"fell asleep.\"\n\nAt the same time, the driver specifically turned his head to look behind him.\n\nHowever, just then, a look of struggle suddenly appeared on the driver's face. Finally, he shook his head forcefully, sighed, and continued driving forward.\n\nIt seemed they were almost at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure how a ghost driving a paper car was able to transport him, a person with a physical body.\n\nIt was hard to explain, because physics doesn't have a \"ghost mechanics\" branch.\n\nThen again, ancient Chinese legends have concepts like \"Yellow Turban Strongmen\" and \"Qimen Dunjia.\" It was probably something similar to that, he figured.\n\nZhou Ze slowly woke up, because he sensed the body of the driver in front of him was slowly radiating light.\n\n*Interesting,*\n\n*I seem to have been running into a lot of good ghosts lately.*\n\nThis driver was supposed to \"collect payment\" from him, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. It must have been his first time doing this kind of thing, and in the end, he couldn't go through with it. In this struggle, he obtained his own release and redemption.\n\nHe was beginning to dissipate.\n\nAfter dissipating, he would enter hell and the cycle of reincarnation.\n\nFrom this, it was clear that not all the \"nonsense\" the driver had said before was a lie. He had four children, he enjoyed the feeling of being a father, he worked hard to earn money and support his family, to provide a good environment for his children to grow up in.\n\nHe was a good father. In terms of personality and character, he was decent enough. After becoming a ghost, he had wanted to try his hand at the \"ghosts carrying a sedan\" business, but in the end, his heart was too soft.\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head and opened his eyes. The driver didn't notice, still engrossed in his driving.\n\nGradually, Zhou Ze noticed light shining in from outside. Through the window, he could see the hustle and bustle of traffic on the road.\n\nThe driver was about to dissipate.\n\nThis must be a segment of the driver's memories from before he died.\n\nProbably similar to the principle of how lightning combined with a special environment can record a scene.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously lit another cigarette. Since the driver had already found his own release, it didn't matter even if he burned this whole car down now.\n\nMusic was playing in the car, a very popular song at the time called \"Liang Liang.\"³\n\nThe driver hummed along as he drove. He must have just finished a big fare and was in a good mood, planning to go home and treat himself to a plate of peanuts, then video chat with his kids for a while. Life was tough, but it was also pretty sweet.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw a minibus appear on the road ahead of the car.\n\nIt was probably a school bus. It had a school crest printed on it, along with the words XXX Elementary School.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't think anything of it, but then a girl suddenly stood up in the backseat of the bus. She was facing the rear of the vehicle, and even from the car behind, he could see her clearly through the glass.\n\nThe girl was wearing a cute, blue lily-patterned dress.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nHe knew this girl. He had saved her. He'd heard she had already woken up. Dr. Lin had even told him a little while ago that the girl's father wanted to host a thank-you dinner and had planned to invite him.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze darkened. Then, this driver was the main culprit behind that car crash?\n\nSo many children were injured.\n\nAnd if he hadn't intervened, some children would have even died.\n\n\"What a pretty little girl. Just like my youngest.\"\n\nThe driver muttered to himself. This was the last of his living memories, so he didn't know that there was another person sitting in the backseat at this moment.\n\nZhou Ze looked around. He didn't think the driver had been drinking, nor did he seem to have any other issues. So, what exactly caused the driver to hit the school bus? What caused that car crash?\n\nWas it a chain-reaction collision caused by a nearby car?\n\nAnd just at that moment,\n\nthe girl in the lily dress, who had been standing at the very back of the school bus, suddenly opened her mouth. Her tongue shot out.\n\nYes,\n\nshot out.\n\nLike a red carpet for newlyweds, it just shot out, long... so long... long enough to make one's scalp tingle.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nthe girl's eyes held a mocking smile, fixed tightly on the driver in front of her.\n\n\"Mommy, a ghost!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nIn his panic, the driver stomped on the accelerator, and the car shot directly towards the school bus in front of it.\n\n\"BOOM!\"\n\nSparks flew.\n\nZhou Ze was standing at the entrance of his bookstore.\n\nOn the ground around him were the ashes of the paper car, not yet fully burned away, scattering with the wind, curling and falling, dissolving into final, tiny specks.\n\nZhou Ze was uninjured, not a single scratch.\n\nAnd that driver had kept his promise, delivering him to his destination.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't rush back into the bookstore.\n\nIn his hand, he still held that cigarette, smoldering slowly.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital, you know.\" The girl's voice still echoed in his ears.\n\nWhat...\n\nexactly...\n\nhad I saved?\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ The character for \"sent\" (捎, shāo) is a homophone for \"burned\" (燒, shāo).\n\n² Master Zhang (張天師, Zhāng Tiānshī) refers to Zhang Daoling, the founder of a major Taoist school. In modern fiction, his name is a general term for a powerful Taoist exorcist or ghost-hunter.\n\n³ \"Liang Liang\" (《涼涼》) is a real Chinese pop song whose title literally means \"Cold Cold.\" It became popular internet slang for \"it's over,\" \"doomed,\" or \"chilled to the bone.\"",

    "content": "The next morning, after washing up, Zhou Ze went to the noodle shop next door as usual. This had gradually become a habit. When eating was no longer a process of enjoyment, it became purely a task. And for a task, simple and efficient was best. Nowhere was more convenient and quick than Xu Qinglang's place.\n\n\"Bitter melon juice.\" Xu Qinglang placed a large glass in front of Zhou Ze, then brought over a serving of egg-fried rice.\n\nZhou Ze took a tentative sip. The moment the liquid entered his throat, all he could feel between his lips and teeth was an unbearable bitterness. Then, after he swallowed, even his intestines and stomach felt like they were tying themselves in knots.\n\nZhou Ze took about ten seconds to recover, then let out a long breath.\n\nIt was truly bitter.\n\n\"Haha, packs a punch, doesn't it?\" Xu Qinglang wore an expression that said, *Go on, praise me*, then sat down across from Zhou Ze. \"Seriously, you really have some intense tastes. You can't eat unless you drink this stuff?\"\n\nZhou Ze composed himself, then picked up the full glass of bitter melon juice and downed it in one go. He immediately grabbed his chopsticks and began to wolf down the egg-fried rice in front of him.\n\nA minute later, Zhou Ze finished his meal, set down his plate, and closed his eyes.\n\n\"That way of eating... you look exactly like a hungry ghost who just clawed its way out of Hell,\" Xu Qinglang teased.\n\nBut whether this was just teasing or had some other meaning, it was impossible to know.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes and glanced at him. On the day of the five migrant workers' *tóuqī*¹ return, it was normal that his sister-in-law and wife couldn't see them. But this noodle shop owner could see them; otherwise, he wouldn't have made those five servings of braised pork over rice.\n\nBut between the two of them was a tacit understanding to see through things but not expose them, and they had never poked through that paper window. Perhaps this was the best way for them to get along.\n\n\"Why aren't you taking orders today?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nIn the past few days, even on New Year's Eve, Xu Qinglang's phone had been buzzing nonstop with takeout orders. But today, it was much quieter, and there were no delivery drivers coming to pick up food.\n\n\"Taking a break.\" Xu Qinglang took out a cigarette, stuck one in his own mouth, and passed one to Zhou Ze.\n\nAlthough it was a bit strange to work on New Year's Eve and rest afterward, as a man who owned over twenty properties, he certainly had the capital to be willful.\n\n\"Ever heard of a ghost sedan chair?\" Zhou Ze asked. The memory of last night's events was still fresh in his mind, but he wasn't in a hurry to do anything about it. He had just gone home and slept in his freezer.\n\nZhou Ze himself had indeed saved the person. If there were any other problems, Zhou Ze didn't want to get involved.\n\nHe was just carefully, and with a mix of seriousness and liveliness, living his own little life. If he encountered things he could handle along the way, he would, but he wouldn't force anything.\n\nEven if there really was something wrong with that little girl in the lily-print dress, it was no longer Zhou Ze's business.\n\n\"Ghost sedan chair?\" Xu Qinglang paused for a moment, then laughed. \"Hehe, you see a lot of those on New Year's Eve, right? They say that when people burn scripture and paper money for the New Year, the ghosts have some spare cash on hand and can afford to hail a ride.\"\n\nXu Qinglang continued his nonsense, then yawned. \"By the way, why isn't your bookstore open yet?\"\n\n\"I'll open it tonight.\"\n\n\"Fine, have it your way.\" Xu Qinglang pulled out his phone and glanced at it a couple of times. \"How about we go see a movie this afternoon?\"\n\nThe scene...\ninstantly fell into an awkward silence.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze refused.\n\n\"Look at you, showing no face at all. And after I went to all the trouble of mixing a new juice for you, you're not even willing to see a movie with me. Men... not a single one of them is any good.\"\n\n\"...\" went Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Sorry, I forgot I'm a man myself.\" Xu Qinglang shook his head with a mournful air, wearing an expression of regret that he wasn't born a woman.\n\n\"Did you experience some kind of psychological trauma as a child?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I know a few psychologists, I could help you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang let out a \"Tch\" and laughed. \"Heterosexuality is just a heresy created for the sake of procreation. Only same-sex love can be true love.\"\n\n\"I dare not agree.\"\n\n\"Those with different paths cannot make plans together.\"\n\nWith that, their post-meal conversation ended on a sour note.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore, opened the door, and after a moment's thought, decided not to lock it. He simply sat down behind the counter, opened his computer, and sent a WeChat message to Dr. Lin:\n\n\"Movie this afternoon?\"\n\nAfter about ten minutes, Dr. Lin replied:\n\n\"Working.\"\n\nThe New Year didn't stop people from getting sick or having accidents. Having once been a doctor himself, Zhou Ze knew that holidays at the hospital were largely a sham.\n\nIt was understandable, but he still felt a bit disappointed.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to tell her that he was Zhou Ze, not some damn Xu Le.\n\nBut he worried the outcome would be Dr. Lin being so frightened she'd question her own sanity, and that it would even destroy the hazy, one-sided crush she had. Of course, the most important thing was that the fewer people who knew certain things, the better.\n\nSomeone would come for him.\nZhou Ze was very clear on this point.\nAnd while he waited, he hadn't chosen to curl up and tremble in some dark corner like a sewer rat. He still needed to live, and to live very normally. Otherwise, he might as well have not come out of Hell and just followed the main host down the Road to the Yellow Springs.\n\nAs for his neighbor next door, whether he had figured him out or not, Zhou Ze didn't know, nor could he be bothered to find out.\n\n\"Tonight, maybe.\"\nDr. Lin sent another message.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. He felt his smile was like that of a complete idiot, just like being back in middle school, seeing the class study monitor give him a shy, sideways glance.\n\nIn his past life, he had lived too exhaustingly.\nIn this life, he had to live a bit more freely and unrestrained.\n\nThere are many truths in life that one can only truly understand just before death or in old age, but by the time you understand, you've already lost the chance to start over.\n\nZhou Ze cherished his current life and opportunity.\n\nA small red car parked on the street in front of the bookstore, and two females got out.\n\nOne was not yet thirty, the other looked to be only five or six.\n\nThe woman wore a red dress, her hair flowing. And although she was a mother, it was hard to hide her captivating charm; in fact, it stirred the heartstrings all the more.\n\nThe little girl wore overalls, and underneath she must have had on several layers of warm clothes, bundling her up like a little *zongzi*.² She was adorable and endearingly naive.\n\nBut when he saw the girl, Zhou Ze's eyes subconsciously narrowed.\n\nThose who come are not kind, and the kind do not come.\nHe hadn't gone looking for her,\nbut she had come looking for him.\n\nHe had felt a bit smug when he heard from Dr. Lin that the girl had been calling for her \"uncle\" at the thank-you dinner. Thinking back now, she had never intended to let him go at all.\n\nWhen it came down to it,\nthe death of that father of four was because of this girl.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. The woman looked around curiously, while the little girl walked timidly to Zhou Ze's counter, looked at Zhou Ze, and said in a soft, sweet voice:\n\n\"Hello, Uncle.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, his expression slightly reserved.\nIn reality, he was wondering if he should just whip out his fingernails and strangle this girl to death.\n\n\"Hello, I'm Ruirui's mother.\"\nThe woman walked up to Zhou Ze and placed a gift box on the counter.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\nThe woman bowed to Zhou Ze.\nIt was a bow full of deep gratitude.\n\n\"You're too kind.\" Zhou Ze still didn't get up.\n\nHe really wanted to act as if everything were normal, so this girl wouldn't suspect a thing.\nBut it was too difficult.\nEven an Oscar-winning actor,\nafter seeing the driver's final memories last night,\nwould probably find it hard to act normally in front of this girl.\n\nSince he couldn't fake it well, he might as well not fake it at all.\n\n\"Mommy, I want to read here,\" Ruirui said to the woman.\n\n\"Alright, Mommy is going to get her hair done. You stay here and read with Uncle.\" The woman smiled at Zhou Ze. \"Sorry to trouble you.\"\n\n\"No trouble.\"\n\n\"It was Dr. Lin who told me you opened a shop here.\"\n\n*That foolish woman.*³\n\n\"You and Dr. Lin are truly a talented man and a beautiful woman.\"\n\nThat was such a disingenuous thing to say; even Xu Le himself wouldn't have believed it.\n\nThe woman drove off, leaving her daughter behind. This was a bookstore, after all. And since Zhou Ze was her daughter's semi-savior and Dr. Lin's husband, she felt very relieved to leave her daughter here for a while, not worried that anything would happen.\n\nNext, Ruirui picked out a picture book herself and sat on a small plastic stool to read it.\nShe wasn't noisy or disruptive.\nShe didn't ask for drinks or whine for snacks.\nZhou Ze just sat behind the counter, watching her.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked in. Seeing the porcelain-doll-like little girl, he immediately went over and picked her up.\n\n\"My, what an adorable little girl.\"\n\n\"Thank you, big sister,\" Ruirui replied.\n\nThe smile on Xu Qinglang's face bloomed like a chrysanthemum, growing ever more brilliant.\nThe little girl's flattery had hit the mark, scratching Xu Qinglang right where he itched.\nZhou Ze, however, sat there with a grim face.\n\n\"Come out, I need to talk to you about something,\" Xu Qinglang said, putting the child down and gesturing to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked outside.\n\n\"Someone from the plaza came by, asking if we want to terminate our contracts. They can refund the rent we prepaid.\"\n\n\"Let's not.\" Zhou Ze didn't want to go through another upheaval just yet. Besides, he didn't have enough capital; even with the refunded rent, it wouldn't be enough to open another store.\n\n\"That's what I was thinking too.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, indicating he understood. \"So I'll go negotiate on your behalf as well?\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\n\"Alright, it's settled then.\"\n\nThe two of them stood outside the shop door, smoked another cigarette, and then parted ways.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze turned around, pushed open the store door, and walked back in,\nhe found that the little girl was no longer on the row of small plastic stools. The picture book was left on one of them.\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\nHe looked up.\nFrom the landing of the stairs, he heard the sound of little leather boots.\nThe little girl emerged from there, half of her figure visible, the other half hidden by the wall.\n\nShe had just been...\non his second floor.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **頭七 (tóuqī):** In Chinese tradition, the 7th day after a person's death.

    "content": "\"Went up to take a look?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little loli shook her head. \"It's dark up there. I can't see anything clearly.\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the little loli slowly walked down and stood in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nShe was very short and wore many layers of clothing. Her delicate face was like an exquisite, masterfully crafted work of art.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that her tongue could get very, very long. So long... it made one's scalp tingle.\n\n\"Uncle, I'm going to keep reading now.\"\n\nThe little loli gave a sweet, innocent smile, sat back down on the small plastic stool, picked up the illustrated children's book, and continued to read with relish.\n\nZhou Ze stood behind her, his hands behind his back.\n\n*Strangle her.*\n\n*Strangle her.*\n\n*Whatever her intentions are,*\n\n*There's no need to keep up this charade!*\n\nThis voice echoed in Zhou Ze's mind. It wasn't someone else's voice; it was his own inner thoughts.\n\nCompared to the noodle shop owner next door, Xu Qinglang, this little loli before him provoked a much greater sense of irritation and revulsion in Zhou Ze.\n\nHe was the one who had saved her.\n\nShe was cute,\n\nsensible,\n\nwell-behaved,\n\nand polite,\n\npossessing a conscientiousness and discipline rare for a child her age.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nit was precisely because his initial impression of her had been so very good that when Zhou Ze saw her true face, the distortion and reversal of that relationship made his revulsion and rejection of her even stronger.\n\nThe little loli continued to read her book, seemingly paying no mind to Zhou Ze behind her, not noticing him at all.\n\nZhou Ze stared at her, able to see even the fine, downy hair on the nape of her neck with perfect clarity.\n\n*Strangle,*\n\n*or not strangle.*\n\n*In the end,*\n\n*to strangle or not to strangle?*\n\n...\n\n\"Dad, Mom, your son is off today.\"\n\nIn the back room, Xu Qinglang had arranged several cold dishes and hot dishes on a small table, along with two glasses of liquor.\n\nOne glass was Maotai; his old man had loved its taste when he was alive.\n\nThe other glass was homemade rice wine. His mother hadn't drunk alcohol and had strongly disliked his father's drinking. Occasionally, when attending a banquet where the hosts were overly enthusiastic, his mother would only drink a little rice wine.\n\nHis mother often said that rice wine was nourishing.\n\nOn the east and west corners of the small table stood two candlesticks, their flames flickering.\n\nTwo sheets of human skin were hung behind the respective seats, fluttering as if in a breeze, though there was none.\n\nXu Qinglang first downed a glass with his father, then had a small sip with his mother.\n\nHe picked up his chopsticks and said to his parents:\n\n\"Eat up, eat up. Dad, you're trying to steal my meat again!\"\n\nHe himself picked up several pieces of meat and wolfed them down.\n\nIn his memory, when he was little, his father always liked to pretend to fight him for the meat, but every time, he would let him quickly wolf it down, until his cheeks were stuffed so full he couldn't swallow.\n\nAnd his mother, at this moment, would scold his father while gently patting his back.\n\nToday was the first day of the Lunar New Year.\n\nGenerally, people worshipped their ancestors before the New Year.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang was different; he did it on this day because his parents had died together in an accident on this very day.\n\nThe New Year,\n\nwhile it may have lost some of its so-called \"New Year flavor\" for ordinary people compared to the past, for Xu Qinglang, it meant the arrival of his moment of sorrow once again.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nXu Qinglang smiled,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Dad, Mom.\"\n\nPursing his lips,\n\nXu Qinglang poured himself another glass of baijiu and drained it in one gulp.\n\nThe spicy liquor made his already delicate and lovely face even more flushed and tender.\n\nHe was a man,\n\nyet a *femme fatale*¹,\n\nIf this were ancient times, he would surely have been the forbidden favorite of many emperors and princes. Of course, even in modern times, if he were willing, he could have had a smooth and successful life.\n\nIt goes without saying how formidable a man who could turn a straight man gay could be.\n\nAfter a long hesitation,\n\nand much contemplation,\n\nXu Qinglang couldn't hold back any longer.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"The man next door... the man next door, I'll find a chance to ask him. Ask him... ask him how exactly he came back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't drunk, but his speech was a little slurred.\n\nClearly,\n\nhe knew in his heart that the man next door wouldn't just sit down and tell him the answer as if it were a normal chat.\n\nThis process,\n\nwould ultimately be somewhat unpleasant, and would require him to use certain methods.\n\nThe two sheets of human skin stopped swaying,\n\nas if displeased.\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it's alright. Your son will definitely bring you back to life!\"\n\n*Clatter!*\n\n*Clatter!*\n\nTwo pairs of chopsticks fell to the floor.\n\nXu Qinglang, holding his own chopsticks, froze for a moment.\n\nBut he still shook his head.\n\n\"No, I can't listen to you this time. Even if you don't agree, I'm still going to pry his mouth open!\"\n\n...\n\n*Strangle,*\n\n*or not to strangle?*\n\nZhou Ze was still pondering this question.\n\nHe didn't know why he was hesitating so much, nor did he understand what he was conflicted about.\n\nHe was a ghost,\n\nno longer the doctor from his past life.\n\nHe was dangerous, and his situation was dire. Therefore, he knew he should nip all dangers in the bud.\n\nThis little loli was a threat to him.\n\nShe had come looking for him.\n\nShe had come of her own accord.\n\nJust like that day when her soul had sought him out to speak.\n\nShe...\n\nhad probably been watching him for a long time.\n\nEven children understood the story of the farmer and the snake. Zhou Ze didn't believe that just because he had once saved her, everything would be fine.\n\nIn fact, most grudges in this world evolved from acts of kindness.\n\nThe nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers had already begun to slowly lengthen, and wisps of black mist were swirling around his fingertips.\n\nAt the same time,\n\na black light was glinting in the depths of Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n*I have to strangle her.*\n\n*Strangle her!*\n\nZhou Ze repeated to himself in his mind. The new life he had struggled so hard to obtain... he still had a life, he still had things he wanted to do.\n\nHe still wanted to be lazy, to reminisce, to think.\n\nHe didn't want to be like the old and young on the Road to the Underworld, numbly and vacantly knowing only to walk forward step by step.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hands,\n\nand slowly moved them toward the little loli.\n\nThe little loli was reading, very engrossed, a smile on her lips, looking very cute and endearing.\n\nSuddenly, she felt two fingers placed on her temples.\n\nShe asked, a little puzzled, \"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Just giving you a little massage to protect your eyes.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" the little loli grunted in acknowledgement and went back to her book.\n\nA perfectly applied pressure came from her temples; the little loli found it very comfortable.\n\nAfterwards,\n\nthe little loli saw her uncle silently walk over to the chair behind the counter and sit down.\n\n\"Uncle, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Zhou Ze said, waving his hand.\n\nThe little loli lowered her head to read again.\n\nThen,\n\n*Smack!* a crisp sound.\n\nThe little loli looked up again toward the counter and saw that one side of Zhou Ze's face was bright red.\n\n\"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Swatting a mosquito.\" Zhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief, then leaned back in his chair, sighing internally: *Damn it, I still couldn't do it. How can I be so useless?*\n\nThe little loli obviously didn't realize there wouldn't be any mosquitoes in the middle of winter, but she still stood up and looked around, as if helping Zhou Ze find the mosquito.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*keep acting.*\n\n*You've really gotten into character, haven't you!*\n\n*You're still acting!*\n\n*And acting so convincingly!*\n\n*Hurry up and stick out your tongue!*\n\n*Let's have a fight!*\n\n*It'd be so much better if you killed me or I killed you.*\n\n*Still hiding behind that loli face, are you banking on the fact that I can't bring myself to do it?*\n\n*I... really can't do it.*\n\n*Fuck!*\n\nZhou Ze felt a little helpless. He turned and went to the restroom, turned on the tap, and splashed cold water hard against his face.\n\n\"You used to be a doctor. Curing illnesses and saving people was instinct, your profession.\n\nYou've fucking turned into a ghost,\n\nso how are you still such a damn goody-two-shoes!\n\nUseless piece of shit!\"\n\nZhou Ze started cursing his reflection in the mirror.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze realized that lately, the frequency with which he cursed himself seemed to be higher than the frequency with which he cursed Xu Le.\n\nMeanwhile, the little loli, who had been sitting in the bookstore reading, put down her book at that moment.\n\nHer gaze, now somewhat profound, glanced toward the restroom door. But instead of walking that way, she walked out of the bookstore,\n\nand went next door.\n\n...\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it's no use no matter how you try to persuade me. I want you to sit here and eat with me properly. He can be like that, so I can make you like that too!\n\nOur family can continue to live together, just like before.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was still rambling on.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nthe two sheets of human skin hanging by the small table began to sway frantically.\n\nA look of shock appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. He looked up at the yellow paper talismans pasted in his back room, only to find that for some unknown reason, the talismans had turned gray.\n\nHe violently threw aside the curtain and rushed out.\n\nHe saw a little girl standing in his family's noodle shop.\n\nThe girl opened her mouth,\n\nand a long tongue stretched out.\n\nVery long.\n\nVery long.\n\nTerrifyingly long!\n\n\"Order must be kept in the underworld; the dead must be on their way.\"\n\nA grim, childish voice came from the girl's mouth.\n\nThe next moment, the two sheets of human skin in the back room began to wither and deteriorate, losing their luster and flexibility. Two streams of white vapor dripped out and landed beside the little girl, transforming into the figures of a middle-aged man and woman.\n\nThey swayed back and forth,\n\nseeming to have forgotten everything,\n\nonly knowing to walk step by step along the long tongue that came out of the girl's mouth, as if her tongue was their final destination, leading to some unknown place.\n\nGradually, their forms began to grow fainter and more blurry.\n\n\"You... you're actually... you're actually a...\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed at the sweet-talking little loli he had just held in his arms not long ago, his face filled with shock. But when he saw his parents slowly disappearing,\n\nhe immediately tried to charge forward hysterically. However, his feet seemed to be shackled, and instead of running, he fell heavily to the ground.\n\nHe stretched out his hand, pointing at his parents, and began to plead:\n\n\"Don't take them away, don't take them away!\n\nI haven't hurt anyone!\n\nI've never hurt anyone!\n\nI just want my family to be together!\n\nThey've never hurt anyone either!\n\nDon't, don't, I'm begging you, I'm begging you...\"\n\nHowever, faced with Xu Qinglang's tearful pleas,\n\nthe little loli remained unmoved. Not until the two souls had completely disappeared did she retract her long tongue and revert to her cute loli appearance.\n\nXu Qinglang felt as if two chunks had been forcibly gouged out of his chest.\n\nHis parents,\n\nhad left him for good.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot. He pounded on the tiled floor, hammering it fiercely.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nas if he'd thought of something,\n\nhe immediately pointed next door and roared:\n\n\"He's not human either! He's not human either!\n\nWhy don't you take him? Why don't you take him!\n\nThis isn't fair! What you're doing isn't fair!\n\nHe's not human either!\n\nWhy did you only take my parents?\n\nHe's not human either!\n\nIt's not fair!\n\nIt's not fair!!!!!!!\"\n\n***\n¹The original term, 紅顏禍水 (hóngyán huòshuǐ), literally means \"a beauty that brings disaster\" and almost exclusively refers to a woman. Using *femme fatale* captures the essence while the text clarifies the gender anomaly.",

    "content": "The bathroom Xu Le had wasn't actually well-renovated. There was only a simple sink and a squat toilet, not even a showerhead. The second floor, forget a bed, didn't even have a straw mat originally; it was purely used as a small storage room, because the Xu Le of the past had to go home every day.\n\nEven if at home there was a pair of in-laws who looked down on him,\n\neven if at home there was a bossy sister-in-law,\n\neven if at home there was a wife who wouldn't sleep with him,\n\nXu Le would still finish the minimal work at the bookstore each day, lock up for the evening, and leisurely head home.\n\nThis was life.\n\nYou couldn't call it dignified,\n\nnor could you say it was liberating,\n\nbut he bore it gladly.\n\nHe was a wimp, a coward, with no ambition.\n\nBecause he was Xu Le, not some great figure who had left a name in history, everyone felt he didn't matter.\n\nBut if you framed it with the identity of some ancient historical figure, you would feel that Xu Le's life was one of great wisdom appearing foolish, gratuitously adding so many layers of meaning.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't appreciate Xu Le's experience. Having grown up in an orphanage, the feeling of inferiority in his heart, though never shown, had always existed. That was why he was sensitive, why he pushed himself so hard—in his studies, his work, his own life, it was always the same. He always insisted on being the best, the most outstanding.\n\nOnly, right now, looking at the wet face in the mirror, a sliver of pity appeared in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nPity for Xu Le, and at the same time, pity for himself.\n\nEveryone has their own cage; it's just a matter of the cage's style and size, but a cage there is.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to become some Ghost King, nor did he fantasize about using his special powers to command the mortal world. On one hand, he knew that if he became too high-profile, something bad would probably happen to him right away. On the other hand, his previous life had been exhausting enough; he wanted to live differently this time.\n\nRegardless, he wanted to live on, in this physical body, to continue living.\n\nHe spread his palm open, holding it before his face. The claws had long since receded, showing no trace of abnormality.\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nForget it.\n\nMaybe this was just what he deserved.\n\nHe used a towel to wipe his face, then his hands, and walked out of the bathroom. Only, when he reemerged, the conflict that had been on his face was gone, replaced by a certain nonchalance.\n\nThe little loli was still sitting on the plastic stool, engrossed in her picture book.\n\n\"Uncle, Ruirui is thirsty.\"\n\nThe little loli called out to Zhou Ze.\n\nLike a pet acting cute and coquettish to its master.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took a paper cup and poured some water, mixing hot and cold, and brought it to the little loli.\n\nThe little loli took the cup, took a sip, and her lips curved into a crescent moon smile.\n\nZhou Ze simply sat down on the tiled floor, reached out, and ruffled the little loli's head, completely at ease, without the slightest guard up.\n\nTime trickled by.\n\nThe little loli continued to read her book.\n\nZhou Ze continued to lie beside her.\n\nOne big, one small.\n\nThey got along peacefully.\n\nThe little loli would bring the interesting stories she saw to Zhou Ze to share with him, and Zhou Ze would respond, telling her about the deeper morals in fables or other little tales.\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, the red sedan drove up again.\n\nThe girl's mother pushed open the door and expressed her thanks to Zhou Ze. Her hair was in the same state as when she arrived. A curve formed on Zhou Ze's lips; he really wanted to suggest the woman go demand a refund from that hair salon. You don't get to fool people like that.\n\nOf course, if he really said that, the woman would probably blame him for being a busybody.\n\nThe little loli bowed to Zhou Ze and said thank you, then left with her mother.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the little loli never looked back at him.\n\nGone was gone.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the counter and picked up the gift box the woman had given him earlier, only to discover a stack of bills inside. Three thousand yuan.\n\nNot bad.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think about returning it.\n\nHe was short on money, so he'd take it and use it for now.\n\nZhou Ze felt like he'd had a breakthrough, like a cultivator who suddenly achieves enlightenment.\n\nBut he also felt like he was just letting it all go to hell, a \"come what may, I'll be carefree\" attitude.\n\nBut no matter what, at least he felt much more relaxed now.\n\nZhou Ze casually picked up a book with a large cover from the shelf. It was an *Analysis of Master Calligraphers' Copybooks*, the kind of thing that was purely unsellable. He had no idea if Xu Le's head had been repeatedly run over by a large iron gate back then to have even stocked this kind of book.\n\nHe flipped it open randomly.\n\nThis page happened to display the four characters for \"Nándé Hútú.\"¹\n\n\"Tsk tsk.\"\n\nZhou Ze clicked his tongue.\n\nInteresting.\n\nHe checked the time and saw it was almost evening. Remembering he had a movie date with Doctor Lin that night, Zhou Ze decided to go get something to eat first.\n\nWalking next door, Zhou Ze froze for a moment, seeing Xu Qinglang kneeling on the floor.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot, and several liquor bottles lay around him. At that moment, he was holding a bottle and continuing to drink.\n\n\"It's not fair... it's not fair...\"\n\nXu Qinglang muttered to himself. Even when Zhou Ze walked into the shop, it was as if he hadn't noticed at all.\n\n\"Hey?\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder. \"Are you alright?\"\n\nHe really wanted to remind Xu Qinglang that for other men, getting drunk might just mean getting their wallet stolen, but if he, Xu Qinglang, got drunk and wandered outside, it wouldn't be as simple as just losing money.\n\nIn fact, if he and a young woman were lying on a street late at night, Xu Qinglang would probably be assaulted more times than the woman.\n\nXu Qinglang's body trembled. He slowly raised his head, his face like pear blossoms in the rain, a sight to evoke pity in anyone. With fingers held in an orchid gesture, he pointed at Zhou Ze and said mournfully,\n\n\"Today is the anniversary of my parents' death.\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, then said, \"My condolences.\"\n\nHe waited a bit.\n\nXu Qinglang continued to drink.\n\nZhou Ze could only remind him, \"Are you not cooking tonight?\"\n\n\"I'll cook! I'll cook!\"\n\nXu Qinglang swayed to his feet, that willow-like waist, so graceful and charming, exceptionally alluring. Especially the way he seemed on the verge of collapsing, making one want to rush up and support him, to breathe in his scent.\n\n\"You don't have to force yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze said this, but still sat down in a chair, ready to eat.\n\nGetting a meal wasn't easy for him, so he didn't want to look for another place.\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and walked into the back room.\n\nSoon,\n\nthe sound of the stove being lit came from inside. Xu Qinglang was stir-frying.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and saw a message Doctor Lin had just sent him, saying she was coming to pick him up soon.\n\nZhou Ze replied with an \"Okay.\"\n\nThinking it over, he felt that wasn't celebratory enough,\n\nand sent a sticker of a laughing cartoon soldier.\n\nThen he immediately felt that was too frivolous,\n\nand retracted the sticker.\n\nThinking it over again, he felt retracting it was like trying to hide something only to make it more obvious,\n\nso he replied with a \"Heh heh.\"\n\nImmediately after, he felt the words \"Heh heh\" weren't friendly enough,\n\nbut then felt that retracting it a second time would seem too contrived.\n\nSo conflicted...\n\nZhou Ze was conflicted at the dining table.\n\nThe other person, the chef currently stir-frying, was also very conflicted.\n\nIn the wok was twice-cooked pork. After frying, it would be ladled over rice to make a bowl of twice-cooked pork over rice—simple and very appetizing.\n\n\"Why didn't she take you? Why did she take my parents?\"\n\nXu Qinglang muttered to himself as he cooked.\n\nAs the old saying goes, \"One worries not about scarcity, but about uneven distribution.\" This phrase explained so, so many principles, and also exposed the darkest side of the human heart.\n\n\"It's not fair, it's really not fair,\" Xu Qinglang continued to mutter.\n\n\"How could you show favoritism? How could you possibly show favoritism?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's gaze was vacant, but the rhythm of his stir-frying didn't change. He was a good cook; cooking had practically become an instinct.\n\nSilently, Xu Qinglang took out a yellow canister from the cabinet under the stove and poured some powder from it into the twice-cooked pork.\n\n\"My parents were taken away, why didn't you go? Don't tell me you saved her life?\"\n\n\"Heh, what a joke.\"\n\n\"You want to eat?\"\n\n\"Fine, I'll give you food to eat.\"\n\nXu Qinglang kept taking deep breaths.\n\n\"Is it ready?\" Zhou Ze urged from outside.\n\n\"Almost.\"\n\nXu Qinglang paused, a flicker of panic and hesitation in his eyes, but he still put the lid on the wok. He realized he hadn't heated his own rice in the microwave yet, so he had to reheat it.\n\nOnce the rice was hot, Xu Qinglang spooned the twice-cooked pork over it and carried the plate out.\n\nZhou Ze was staring at his phone screen, still conflicted. Seeing Xu Qinglang walk over, looking lost and dejected, he put down the meal and said with some concern,\n\n\"In your state, you didn't forget the salt, did you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks, ready to eat.\n\nXu Qinglang's hand trembled. His lips parted slightly, just as he was about to speak, but Zhou Ze put his chopsticks down.\n\n\"Where's the sour plum juice or bitter melon juice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, right.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went back and returned with a glass of sour plum juice.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the sour plum juice first, sniffed it, then took a deep breath, preparing to drink it when his phone vibrated.\n\n\"I'm here, come out.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then put the sour plum juice down.\n\nHe knew that if he ate this meal, his face would probably be sour for a long time afterward, like everyone around him owed him a huge sum of money.\n\nThinking about it, he decided against it.\n\nAdding his past and present lives together, this was his first time ever asking a girl out to the movies. He should be a bit more dignified.\n\nThere was no helping it. Originally, his quest difficulty for Doctor Lin was a beginner's task.\n\nNow, having swapped into Xu Le's skin, the novice quest had instantly become a final boss-level mission.\n\nShould he be secretly delighted or just miserable?\n\nWhat he had to strive for now was...\n\nto defeat himself? Only then could he win the fair lady's heart.\n\n\"The money, put it on my tab. We'll settle it at the end of the month. I'm leaving.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up and pushed the door open to leave.\n\nDoctor Lin's car was parked by the road, window down, waiting for him.\n\nAnd in the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang's expression shifted between stormy and clear, then he suddenly flung the entire plate of twice-cooked pork with rice onto the floor.\n\nClutching his head, he began to cry on the ground.\n\nHis crying grew louder and louder,\n\nuntil finally,\n\nit turned into dry wails...\n\n***\n\n¹ A famous phrase (难得糊涂) meaning \"Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise,\" or more literally, \"The virtue of being muddled.\"",

    "content": "Doctor Lin got out of the car, just as Zhou Ze was walking over. The two of them had a strange sort of rapport, neither saying a word as they silently walked towards the entrance at the other end of the mall.\n\nThis mall was already \"dead.\" Aside from the small shop belonging to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, all that was left was a movie theater and a buffet restaurant.\n\nOf course, given the overall situation, the theater was probably operating at a loss, too. On a normal day, hardly anyone came to watch movies here; you could easily buy a ticket and have a private screening.\n\nBut since it was the New Year holiday, most people were off work. Families coming out to see a movie together had become a common sight, adding a splash of rare liveliness to a theater that was usually frozen solid with desolation.\n\nTo Zhou Ze, however, this bustle felt more like the final flare-up of a dying flame.\n\nThe great building was about to fall. This, he supposed, was a case of \"when the nest is overturned, no egg stays intact.\"\n\nZhou Ze went to buy the tickets, adding a couple's combo. After checking the time, he and Doctor Lin walked into the theater.\n\nBecause they were a bit late and Zhou Ze had bought tickets for the earliest showtime, all the good seats were gone. He and Doctor Lin could only sit in the front row.\n\nIt wasn't that they couldn't have waited, but there was nothing else to do in the mall. Besides, *Neon Street Detective 2* was a 2D movie, so sitting in the front row wouldn't make a huge difference.\n\nDoctor Lin hadn't said much on the way over, and now she sat beside Zhou Ze in extreme quiet, gently crossing her long legs and looking up at the screen.\n\nZhou Ze offered her the popcorn. Doctor Lin waved her hand, indicating she didn't want any.\n\nZhou Ze sighed. For someone who'd been an old bachelor in his past life, the art of pursuing a woman was truly an unfamiliar subject.\n\nThe movie had some decent jokes. Zhou Ze chuckled occasionally, and Doctor Lin often smiled too, but her smile was silent—subtle, and very beautiful.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze, the atmosphere of the movie date was still somewhat different from what he had expected.\n\nA bit bland, like a dish with no salt.\n\nWhen the movie ended, Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin walked out side by side. It was only seven in the evening, not late at all, but once they left the theater area, the rest of the mall was already pitch black.\n\nDoctor Lin remained silent, simply walking along with him.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to say something but didn't know what.\n\nHe was the one who'd said he wanted to end things and say goodbye yesterday. If he acted too eager today, wouldn't she think he was a lunatic?\n\n\"Let's go to my bookstore...\"\n\n\"Let's go sit at your bookstore...\"\n\nIt seemed both of them were trying to break the awkwardness and happened to think of the same thing.\n\nBack at the bookstore, Zhou Ze saw that the noodle shop was already closed. Its roll-up door was pulled down, which was rare. He didn't know if Xu Qinglang was still inside.\n\nDoctor Lin picked out a magazine and sat down in the chair behind the counter. Zhou Ze grabbed a book and sat next to her, flipping through it idly.\n\nTwo cups of hot tea sat on the counter, tendrils of steam rising from them.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze felt he no longer had the right to mock Xu Le. He realized that managing to make a first date this \"cultured\" and \"mutually respectful\" was a rare feat indeed!\n\nSo rare he wanted to reward himself with a slap across the face!\n\n\"You're... not closing now?\" Doctor Lin asked. In fact, her subtext was that she wanted to leave. It was late, after all. If Zhou Ze closed the shop, she could take the opportunity to say goodbye.\n\n\"Oh, I usually open for business at night,\" Zhou Ze replied, completely missing her subtext. He was telling the truth.\n\nDoctor Lin was momentarily speechless. She could only offer a small smile, tuck a strand of dark hair behind her ear, and go back to reading her book.\n\n*Creeak...*\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and two men and a woman walked in.\n\nNone of the three were very old, looking to be in their early twenties. The two men had clearly been drinking; one of them was especially flushed, his whole face ruddy.\n\n\"Boss, do you have any water?\" the woman asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the water cooler against the wall.\n\nThe woman went to pour a few cups of hot water and handed them to her friends. Then she walked to the counter and asked:\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nAs she spoke, she took out her phone, apparently ready to pay by scanning a code.\n\n\"Thirty,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Boss, you can't rip people off like this just because it's the New Year. Thirty yuan for three cups of plain water,\" the woman said with a laugh, but she scanned the code and paid anyway. Then she turned to her two male companions. \"Let's just rest here for a bit. Read a book or something.\"\n\nThey were treating the bookstore as a temporary resting spot. To them, Zhou Ze charging 30 yuan was probably like a minimum charge at a teahouse, which was understandable.\n\n\"Read a book? What kind of book?\" the tipsy man shouted, his voice a little loud. \"I want to read ghost stories, horror novels! You got any in this shop?\"\n\nThe man laughed heartily to himself as he spoke.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, pulled two horror anthologies from under the counter, walked over to the man, and handed them to him. At the same time, he casually brushed a finger against him.\n\n*Yep, human. Not a ghost.*\n\nTonight's date was already a failure. If he made Doctor Lin experience another \"Night Parade of a Hundred Demons\" like the time with those five migrant worker brothers, that would just be the absolute worst. Zhou Ze did not want that.\n\n*As long as they're human, it's fine. They even look cute, drunk as he is.*\n\nAs for the other two, Zhou Ze didn't bother trying to touch them; it wasn't convenient.\n\nThe drunk man sat down, and his two friends, the man and the woman, also sat on the plastic stools. The three of them played on their phones while half-heartedly flipping through the books.\n\nIt was purely to make it seem like they were getting their money's worth for the 30-yuan minimum charge, at least on the surface.\n\n\"What kind of crap is this ghost story?\" The man tossed the book aside, and it landed right next to the water cooler.\n\nThe woman went to pick it up and discovered that because she'd spilled some water earlier, the book's cover and some of its pages were now wet.\n\n\"Boss, how much is it?\"\n\n\"Eighty percent of the list price.\" Zhou Ze was actually amused. These three young people had some decency, after all.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze was secretly hoping the drunk guy would hurry up and toss every book on his shelves, getting them all dirty. It would be a great way to clear his inventory.\n\nThe woman, looking a bit helpless, scanned the code to pay again. Then she went to the drunk man. \"Let's go. Stop messing around.\"\n\n\"This isn't a ghost story. The person who wrote it has definitely never seen a ghost,\" the drunk man insisted stubbornly.\n\nZhou Ze let out a soft \"hmph.\" *Well, you probably have seen a ghost. There's one right in front of you.*\n\n\"I'm not going back! Absolutely not! I'm not planning to sleep tonight!\" the man continued his drunken rant. \"I see a ghost when I go home, I see a ghost when I sleep! I'd rather stay here and read all night in this bookstore! At least... I won't run into a ghost here!\"\n\n...Zhou Ze.\n\nAt this, Doctor Lin also put down her book and looked at the drunk man. Clearly, she found this quite interesting.\n\n\"Yo, Brother Liu, you've got a ghost at your place?\" the man who had come in with him teased.\n\nThe woman shot him a glance, signaling him to stop talking nonsense.\n\n\"Screw you! Your family has ghosts!\" The drunk man stood up. \"Damn it, that ghost only knows how to torment me every New Year. It doesn't bother anyone else! I have three brothers, one sister, plus my parents and my grandparents—it doesn't mess with any of them, only me!\"\n\n\"A female ghost?\" his companion asked.\n\n\"If only it were a female ghost! It's a fe... male... dog!\"\n\n*Pfft!* The drunk man's two companions couldn't help but laugh. Even Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin lowered their heads and coughed a few times. It was, admittedly, quite funny.\n\nEspecially the aggrieved look on his face when he said it wasn't a female ghost, but a fe... male... dog.\n\nThis baby's heart is bitter, and this baby is drunk and wants to vent!¹\n\n\"Every New Year, for a few days before and after, it comes for me! As soon as I fall asleep, it shows up! Fuck!\"\n\nAlthough the man was on a drunken rant, he was still in control. It wasn't scary; instead, he seemed rather amusing.\n\n\"It started seven years ago, and it's been happening ever since. Every New Year, it shows up right on time—more punctual than my parents giving me my New Year's money!\" The man clutched his head, squatted on the floor, and started to cry. \"Dammit, I can't live like this!\"\n\n\"What's the full story? Did you know the dog?\" his male companion asked.\n\n\"It was a dog our family used to have. It pulled out the money my dad kept under his bed and chewed it to pieces, so my brothers and I killed it and ate it.\"\n\n\"The dog must have been holding a grudge. It came back for revenge,\" the companion analyzed.\n\n\"But what I fucking don't understand is why it only comes after me! When we killed the dog, it was me, my older brothers, my dad, and my grandpa! When we ate the dog meat, the whole family ate together, just treating it as an extra dish for the New Year! That dog destroyed five thousand yuan; it deserved to be eaten! But why does it only hate me?\"\n\nThe drunk man was almost in tears. \"I've asked them! My brothers, my dad, my grandpa—nothing's happened to any of them! Why does it single me out?\"\n\n\"You're drunk. Come on, I'll take you home.\" The woman helped the man up and signaled to their male friend to help.\n\nThe group left the bookstore, and the previous liveliness instantly faded into quiet.\n\n\"What do you think? Why?\" Doctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze, not caring if the story was real or not, just making small talk after hearing it. \"That dog, why does it only torment him? Is there something different about him?\"\n\n\"You're interested in this?\" Zhou Ze asked, a little surprised.\n\n\"Mhm.\" Doctor Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Actually, it's very simple. With a dog, if you want to understand its thinking, you first have to put yourself in the dog's place.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Doctor Lin said, suppressing a smile. \"It's pretty hard to put yourself in a dog's place.\"\n\nIndeed, how could a person adopt a dog's mindset?\n\n\"A dog's spirit comes back for revenge, to torment someone, because it has resentment,\" Zhou Ze explained. \"It should be the same as with people.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't it go after the other family members?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's because of the money. The dog was mischievous and chewed up part of it, but it's possible this guy, who was young at the time, stole another part of it. So the dog feels it's deeply unfair. It tore up the money and was punished—killed and eaten. It feels that was justified, that it deserved it. But on what grounds did the person who *also* stole money, who also made some of it disappear, get away with nothing? That's why it holds a grudge. It doesn't go after the others in the family; it goes after him specifically.\"\n\nDoctor Lin shook her head, looking surprised. \"It was just a drunkard's rambling story, but after your analysis, it almost sounds like it could be real.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over to where the group had been sitting and noticed a wallet on the floor. He picked it up and went to the shop's entrance.\n\nJust then, the woman from the group came jogging back.\n\n\"Excuse me, did we leave a...\"\n\nZhou Ze held out the wallet.\n\n\"Thank you so much!\" The woman bowed to Zhou Ze in gratitude. \"If this guy went home tonight having lost his wallet and ID, he'd get another earful from his family.\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave.\n\nShe waved back at Zhou Ze, then turned and ran to catch up with her friends.\n\nUnder the moonlight,\n\nas the woman ran,\n\nfrom beneath her coat,\n\nit seemed as if a fluffy, yellow tail was swinging gently...\n\n***\n*¹A then-current internet slang phrase (`寶寶心裡苦`) where one refers to oneself as \"baby\" to express self-pity or grievance in a cute, whiny way.*",

    "content": "Zhou Ze figured his eyes must be playing tricks on him. He’d just heard a drunk’s ghost story about a dog, and coupled with the dim streetlights, it was perfectly normal for his vision to be blurry.\n\nYes, that must be it.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't some Zhang Tianshi from Mount Longhu;¹ he knew he was still something of a \"softie.\" He couldn't change himself—otherwise, he would have extended his own fingernails to pinch that little loli during the day.\n\nAs for whether the end result would be him being pinched to death by the little loli or him still being pinched to death by the little loli,\n\nthat was impossible to know.\n\nSince he couldn't change himself, he might as well try to let fewer messy things affect him. If he could avoid something he saw, he would. If he could cover his eyes, he would.\n\nIn any case, that dog had been toying with the man for seven years. Counting the years,\n\nit was about time for the seven-year itch.\n\nIf that dog really wanted to harm someone, it would have done so long ago. As for what trouble it would stir up next, Zhou Ze couldn't care less.\n\nThe woman had come to his shop, bought some water to compensate for the book, and paid promptly. That was a positive connection, and that was enough.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was discovering for the first time that there were quite a few unbelievable things in this world. Perhaps it was because he used to be a human and was now a ghost; different circles naturally meant different perspectives on the world.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin had also walked over to the shop entrance by this time.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"I'm glad I'm not like Spider-Man, without some random elderly relative popping up to tell me:\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nDr. Lin didn't understand what he meant, but she still said, \"I should be heading back.\"\n\nIt was getting late; she really should be heading back.\n\n\"You're not staying a bit longer?\"\n\n\"I might have to be on duty tomorrow,\" Dr. Lin said, tying her scarf.\n\n\"You can reschedule,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's not convenient.\"\n\n\"You don't want to?\"\n\nDr. Lin frowned slightly. This was the first time she had sensed such an aggressive feeling from Zhou Ze, and she was a little flustered.\n\n\"You're my wife,\" Zhou Ze said very seriously, looking into Dr. Lin's eyes.\n\nDr. Lin took a small step back. \"Yesterday, you said...\"\n\nJust yesterday, Zhou Ze had said it was over, that they were both free.\n\n\"Yesterday was yesterday.\" Zhou Ze took a small step forward. \"Until I sign the divorce papers, I'm your husband, and you're my wife. So, I want you now, to stay and keep me company a little longer!\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice grew louder and louder.\n\nDr. Lin didn't speak, just stood where she was.\n\nA nameless rage suddenly surged within Zhou Ze.\n\nHe reached out a hand and pinched Dr. Lin's jaw, making a flippant gesture of lifting her chin.\n\nDr. Lin looked at him, her gaze clear and calm. Especially those crimson lips, they were mesmerizing. She was beautiful, truly beautiful—the kind of beauty where exquisite features and a perfectly matching temperament gave people a very comfortable feeling.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and kissed her directly on the lips.\n\nHe kissed her fiercely and roughly, like a savage beast, his vicious nature completely exposed from within his body! And the woman before him was the object of his conquest.\n\nDr. Lin raised her hand, as if preparing to slap the man before her, but halfway up, she slowly lowered it again.\n\nFrom the corner of her eye, a crystalline teardrop fell.\n\n\"What are you crying for?\"\n\nTheir lips parted.\n\nZhou Ze looked up at Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"Do you think your tears will make me feel guilty? Do you think crying will make me stop?\n\nI'm telling you,\n\ncrying won't do you any good today. You're my wife, and I'm your husband!\n\nLook at your parents, what pieces of work are they? Look at your sister, the way she usually looks at me!\n\nAnd then look at you.\n\nYou're so noble,\n\nso cold and beautiful,\n\nyou're a goddess,\n\nyou don't partake in the mortal world!\n\nIn the bedroom, you even sleep in a separate bed from me!\n\nWe're married, you're a wife now, yet you still hypocritically care about your chastity. Take a look at yourself, are you even worthy!\n\nI know, I'm just a damn idiot. In your whole family's eyes, I'm a good-for-nothing loser and a damn idiot!\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed Dr. Lin's neck with one hand, pushed her against the counter, and then directly pulled off her coat.\n\n\"Today, I'll teach you, I'll show you, what a wife is supposed to do!\"\n\n\"Xu Le...\" Dr. Lin didn't resist. She just looked coldly at Zhou Ze. \"You... bastard...\"\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze smirked, completely unconcerned. He then took off his own coat and pinned Dr. Lin directly onto the counter.\n\nHe was rough, he was savage.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nthe dry firewood was already piled up; all it needed was a tiny spark to burst into a raging fire!\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was this very kindling!\n\nShe smelled so good, her skin was so soft, her body so voluptuous. Everything was so wonderful, so intoxicating.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze suddenly froze, staggering back several steps.\n\nBefore him, Dr. Lin lay on the counter, her blouse in disarray, while Zhou Ze himself was panting heavily.\n\nNo,\n\nHow did it come to this?\n\nDr. Lin was still lying on the counter. She was still wide-eyed, she still hadn't resisted.\n\nShe felt guilty towards Xu Le. She was a very independent and strong woman, but the social environment she existed in and the family education she had received since childhood left her in a constant state of conflict.\n\nHer parents had threatened her with death, hoping for grandchildren to be born soon, which forced her to agree to marry Xu Le. Yet she held fast to her own bottom line, her heart belonging to another man—even though that man had died in a car accident half a year ago, even though that man had probably long forgotten her, or perhaps never even knew that a woman like her had been secretly paying attention to him for years after her internship ended.\n\nTo describe it in the critical style often found in middle school textbooks: Dr. Lin had yielded to feudal customs in her life, yet she was unwilling to live like that forever, still holding on to her own principles and resistance in her heart.\n\nThis was also why, despite being ten thousand times unwilling, Lin Wanqiu still hadn't resisted and had just let Zhou Ze do as he pleased.\n\nShe felt she had no reason to resist. Zhou Ze was her husband, and she was well aware that her own behavior since the marriage had wronged her husband and their marriage.\n\nShe didn't accept it, she didn't agree to it,\n\nbut she didn't resist.\n\n\"Put your clothes on, get your clothes back on for me!\"\n\nZhou Ze roared at Lin Wanqiu, who was still lying on the counter.\n\nLin Wanqiu was stunned for a moment. She stood up straight, looking at Zhou Ze in disbelief. Just a moment ago, she had already resigned herself to her fate.\n\n\"I haven't even done anything to you yet, so don't you dare look like you've just been violated. Put your clothes on for me,\n\nnow,\n\nimmediately,\n\nat once,\n\nand then get out!\"\n\nDr. Lin silently put her clothes back on, then straightened the hem of her clothes in front of a mirror. Her face was expressionless. When she was all put together, she poured Zhou Ze a new cup of hot water and placed it on the counter. Then, without even looking at Zhou Ze, she walked straight out of the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze slumped to the floor, somewhat dazed, somewhat bewildered.\n\nThe warmth from her body seemed to linger on his lips and in his palms. He didn't know why he had stopped, nor did he understand why he hadn't continued.\n\nIt felt so good,\n\nhe longed for it so much,\n\nhe was so intoxicated,\n\nbut for some reason, he felt something was wrong. It seemed... this wasn't the feeling he wanted.\n\nHe was about to sleep with her.\n\nShe had consented to it.\n\nBut that scene just now was completely different from what he had wanted.\n\nZhou Ze staggered to his feet. He picked up the cup, took a sip, then spat out the hot water. The water was scalding, not tempered with the slightest bit of cold water.\n\nHe dropped the cup, letting the water wet the floor. Zhou Ze looked around, recalling his actions just now, replaying the words he had just said.\n\nHis fists clenched, then relaxed, then quickly clenched again.\n\nHe went to the bathroom, turned on the tap in the sink, and stuck his head directly under the running water.\n\nHe needed to calm down, to become serene,\n\nnot just to quell the lustful fire in his body, but also the one in his heart.\n\nThe chill of winter water was not something an ordinary person could endure. Zhou Ze lifted his head, feeling a wave of dizziness wash over his mind.\n\nHe looked at the mirror before him.\n\nIn the mirror, his own face was reflected.\n\nZhou Ze's hands gripped the porcelain edge of the sink tightly as he gasped for breath. Then, he slowly raised his head again, as if talking to himself, and said:\n\n\"It was you!\n\n\"It was you, you damn son of a bitch, you good-for-nothing coward!\n\nYou're influencing me, you're trying to control me,\n\nyou piece of trash, you scumbag, you mutt!\"\n\nZhou Ze cursed at his reflection in the mirror.\n\nYes,\n\nthat wasn't him. His behavior just now had been too abnormal. That nameless, rising fire, that unreasonable stupor, that inexplicable impulse,\n\nit was definitely not as simple as being young and full of vigor.\n\nJust now, at that moment,\n\na guy he thought had long since gone to hell, had long ceased to exist in this world,\n\nhad influenced him.\n\nHe hadn't left.\n\nHe was still hiding nearby.\n\nOr rather,\n\nhe was hiding inside his own body!\n\nHe was a coward, he was weak. He had been looked down upon his entire life, not daring to fight back, not having the guts to lift his head. But after death, cowering in a corner, he wanted to use someone else's hands to take revenge on his wife in the simplest, most brutish way!\n\nUsing another person's power to get revenge on his own wife.\n\n\"I used to feel sorry for you, I felt a little bit bad for you,\" Zhou Ze murmured. \"Now I understand. There's always a reason to despise the pitiable. The fact that you lived your life the way you did can only be described as you getting what you deserved!\"\n\n*Crack!*\n\nZhou Ze raised his fist and smashed it directly into the mirror.\n\nThe mirror shattered.\n\nZhou Ze's palm was also gushing blood, which began to drip into the sink.\n\nOn the fragmented pieces of the mirror,\n\nZhou Ze's face was still reflected.\n\nNo,\n\nit was Xu Le's face.\n\nZhou Ze stood there without moving.\n\nThe person in the mirror didn't move either.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\na malicious glint appeared in the eyes of the person in the mirror, who then spoke:\n\n\"Well, well, you found me out.\"\n\n***\n¹**Zhang Tianshi from Mount Longhu:** A reference to the founder of a major school of Taoism, often depicted as a powerful master of spiritual and supernatural arts.

    "content": "\"You are looking for death.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's eyes swelled deep, and at this moment, he was very angry\n\n\n\nYes, he is a turtle nest,\n\n\n\n  but,\n\n\n\nSo what?\n\n\n\nI'm going to keep living with your body, you can stop it\n\n\n\nYour report,\n\n\n\nJust suddenly it stimulated me and let me use it on your wife\n\n\n\nThat's the point of promising\n\n\n\nZhou Ze opened his right hand, and the black nails slowly grew out, and a black fog circle was lying on it.\n\n\n\nMany times, the real solution to a problem depends on where you are sitting, that is, your position\n\n\n\nStanding by Zhou Ze's position, there is no way to divide anything wrong. If he wants to live, all actions based on this premise will be correct. Otherwise, everything will lose its meaning.\n\n\n\nLosing meaning, correctness and whether there is still a need for existence\n\n\n\n\"No matter where you hide, I will catch you, even if... you hide in this body.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's face began to twist, and his nails began to pinch into his chest\n\n\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\n\n\nThe dramatic pain accompanied by the difficulty of twitching, Zhou Ze suddenly got up and fell to the ground.\n\n\n\nHe opened his mouth,\n\n\n\nI was a little confused.\n\n\n\nNot here,\n\n\n\nNot there at all\n\n\n\n  Why,\n\n\n\nHe just verified his soul because he was almost broken by himself. In this body, there is only Zhou Ze's only soul, Xu Le, who does not exist at all.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze crawled up again and stood up, looking at the broken lens, still his own face. After waiting for a long time this time, the people in the lens did not change in the slightest.\n\n\n\nXu Le, it no longer exists.\n\n\n\nSo, everything I did to Dr. Lin before was my nature\n\n\n\n  No,\n\n\n\nThis is impossible,\n\n\n\n  impossible\n\n\n\n  不可能是這樣\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought for the first time that he was so strange in the mirror. It was not because he changed his body and appearance, but because his inner heart and soul seemed to know him from his original self.\n\n\n\nFundamentally different\n\n\n\nWhich one is the real self, body or soul?\n\n\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, many great poets and thinkers from China and abroad have actually given a similar answer: the body will change and decay, but the soul can last forever.\n\n\n\nIt can be noble, it can be recorded, it can always shine in the long river of history\n\n\n\nZhou Ze also thought that he was still Zhou Ze, or his original self. At present, his body has changed, but he still thought he was Zhou Ze.at the moment,\n\n\n\nHe began to be afraid.\n\n\n\nBecause since Xu Le's soul no longer exists,\n\n\n\nThis means,\n\n\n\nWhat changed...it was himself\n\n\n\n …………………\n\n\n\n\"You go to bed, love me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I'll go to rest first, and you'll finish your rest early.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, I'll modify this treatment plan.\"\n\n\n\nWang Fu twisted his neck lightly and yawned. He was indeed very sleepy, but he had to finish the work on his head. He was just out of thirty, and there were already a lot of white hair on his head.\n\n\n\nThis old man is the most awkward and does not fight. He has grown up too early. If he fights, his body has already begun to slowly decline.\n\n\n\n\"Dingdingding...Dingdingding...Dingdingding......\"\n\n\n\nWang Fu was slightly browsing. It was so late, and someone came to visit.\n\n\n\nHe walked to the mysterious gate, glanced at the man wearing a black coat standing outside the video screen, and asked, \"Please ask, you are.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm looking for Wang Fu, and my friend introduced me to me.\"\n\n \n\n\"I'm sorry, if you have any questions, you can make an appointment with my assistant. I'm at home...\"\n\n\n\n\"Zhou Ze introduced me,\" said the man outside the door.\n\n\n\nWhen Wang Fu heard this name, he was stunned for a moment, and then opened the door.\n\n\n\nThe other party looks a little young, and may be only twenty-five years old.\n\n\n\n\"Come in.\" Wang Qi signaled the other party to come in, and made a cup of tea for him and put it on the tea table.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa, looking at his former friend\n\n\n\nHe still hasn't changed. He has been working hard in his own industry. As children who grew up in orphans, they have had a good relationship since childhood. In the eyes of the nursing director, these two are the most promising children who have walked out of orphans in recent years.\n\n\n\nZhou Chengnian was the deputy director of the hospital, and Wang Fu already had his own psychological clinic. It was not a small shop in a cramped location, but a next to the South Street in the hearts of Tongcheng people.\n\n\n\nEven this villa is definitely not something that ordinary people can afford.\n\n\n\n\"You know Zhou Ze,\" Wang Fuxian asked\n\n\n\n\"Well, I've been dead for half a year,\" Zhou Ze replied, then picked up the teacup and took a sip. He still liked to drink Maojian, but his taste has not changed.\n\n\n\n\"Look for me, what's wrong?\"\n\n\n\n  「看病」\n\n\n\n\"Treat a doctor\" Wang Qi coughed, \"You can make an appointment\"\n\n\n\n\"Very anxious\" Zhou Ze looked at Wang Fu's eyes, \"Very anxious\"\n\n\n\nWang Qi was silent, then smiled, clicked his head, stood up, and said, \"Please come to the bookroom with me.\"\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether the other party's sudden visit is absurd or not, since the other party's request is said to be Zhou Ze's friend, Wang Fu has no reason and no way to recommend it.Zhou Ze sat in Wang Qi's room for a while. Wang Qi walked in with a dress of white clothes, which showed his grandfather.\n\n\n\n\"Tell me about your situation.\" Wang Fu turned the steel pen in his hand. It was a dark golden steel pen, which was very eye-catching under the lights of the book room.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly slammed his head, \"Don't hypnosis on me, even if it's pure hypnosis.\"\n\n\n\nWang Hui clicked the head and put down the steel pen\n\n\n\n\"I may have some...schizophrenia.\" Zhou Ze organized his own measures\n\n\n\n\"A little more specific,\" Wang Fu asked\n\n\n\n\"I feel that in my body, there is another person's personality. It is said that at a certain moment, that person's personality suddenly affects me to do things, and I can clearly sense that it is definitely not something I should have done.\n\n\n\nI have always been...a very self-disciplined person.\"\n\n\n\n\"The sign of split personality\" Wang Hui narrowed his eyes, \"How long has it been?\"\n\n\n\n\"Recently\"\n\n \n\n\"That's it. On this paper, paint your second personality, and you will use your own feelings to paint his image, even if you have never seen his true image.\"\n\n\n\nWang Hui delivered a piece of white paper and the steel pen to Zhou Ze\n\n\n\n\"Second Personality\" Zhou Ze asked\n\n\n\n\"Yes\" Wang Fu's point head\n\n\n\n\"But... I am the second personality in strict terms.\" Zhou Ze pointed to himself, \"Who is now in trouble should be the original personality of this body.\"\n\n\n\nWang Qi's eyes narrowed and he began to review Zhou Ze again\n\n\n\n\"You mean that your current state is the second personality\"\n\n\n\n\"According to your theory, it should be,\" Zhou Ze replied\n\n\n\nOriginally, the owner of this body was Xu Le, and Zhou Ze was an outsider, so Zhou Ze belonged to the second personality\n\n\n\n\"You have killed him.\" Wang Fuqiu asked with interest. He seemed...it was a little excited.\n\n\n\n\"That's right, and I believe it, he's gone,\" Zhou Ze replied\n\n\n\n\"Then you are actually killing people,\" Wang Qi reminded, \"Although you cannot determine your behavior in law, and you cannot characterize your behavior, but I still have to sit here and punish you.\"\n\n\n\n\"What after the custody is over?\"\n\n\n\n\"You came to me to find a way to completely eliminate the impact of your first personality on you.\"\n\n\n\n  \"Yes\"\n\n\n\nWang Qi began to turn the steel pen again. This time it was not for hypnosis, but because he was thinking.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know if I should help you, because from my perspective, you killed a 'people' that existed, and if I help you, I'm helping you to destroy your wits and I'll be helping you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Help me,\" Zhou Ze said\n\n\n\n\"I need to think about it,\" Wang Fu pondered\n\n\n\n\"No need to think about it, help me,\" Zhou Ze urged, and then Zhou Ze said again, \"Brother Erdan\"\n\n\n\nWhen the voice of \"Brother Erdan\" came out, Wang Fu's face changed, and he said in surprise: \"Zhou Zelian has told you this.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze’s point head\n\n\n\nWang Qi raised his head, with some confusion, but he still gritted his teeth and began to pick up the steel pen writing sheet:\n\n\n\n\"I'll give you some medicines. These medicines are actually just aids, which can help you calm your mood and help you sleep.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then there is no need to open it,\" Zhou Ze said\n\n\n\n\"The most important step is that you need to change the environment.\" Wang Qi ignored Zhou Cheng's previous words, wrote a single letter and continued: \"Remove the social relationship that originally lived in your first personality, and re-construct the social relationship that belongs to you.\n\n\n\nMany people believe that human thoughts are only placed on souls. Although there are souls in this world, that is, whether there are ghosts or ghosts, or unknown.\n\n\n\nBut this statement itself is inaccurate. In fact, our bodies, our muscles, our eyes, and many parts and organs can actually store a person's \"spirit\". This \"spirit\" is different from the broad soul.\n\n\n\nIt refers to the \"muscle memory\" and \"psychological hints\" created by sportsmen through countless repeated training. You can understand it as a habitual\n\n\n\nYou are the second personality, you will die of the first personality.\n\n\n\nBut this body has been in the hands of the first personality for too long. It has its own habits and memory. Sometimes the reason why you suddenly make inexplicable choices makes you feel shocked and disgusted afterwards, and you have a feeling that the first personality is still in trouble.\n\n\n\nIt is for this reason\n\n\n\nFirst cut off all your current international networks, build your own life circle, let this body start to adapt to you again, offset the previous habits, and solve the problem.\n\n\n\nIn fact, your current situation is not serious, your thinking logic is very clear, overcoming it is just a short time problem,\" Wang Qi smiled\n\n\n\nAt this time, someone knocked on the door outside the book room.\n\n\n\n\"Love, there are guests\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, please pour me two more cups of coffee.\"\n\n\n\n  \"OK\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought of Dr. Lin, his father-in-law and his sister-in-law, and his sister-in-law.\n\n\n\nOK,\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, he rejected that person's relationship and even wanted to stop it.\n\n\n\nBut I don’t know when it started.\n\n\n\nShe doesn't sleep with me anyway.\n\n\n\nInstead, it became my own thought\n\n\n\n\"How long does it take to break the relationship?\" Zhou Ze asked\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't take long.\" Wang Fu looked very relaxed, \"I have been watching you since you entered the door. What do you say about the feeling you give me?\n\n\n\nYou are the second personality, but I think you are the case that I have seen in which the second personality kills the first personality the most thoroughlyJust like... the borrowed soul in ancient monster novels is very simple and quick, and can even be described as \"perfect\"\n\n\n\nNow, you can understand it as the minor side effects of taking a medicine. It can be overcome by your own immunity. Maybe it will only take two or three months.\n\n\n\nAfter that, you can just regain the previous relationship with people again, and there will be no problems.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the head, \"Thank you\"\n\n\n\n  \"You are welcome\"\n\n\n\n\"Coffee is here\"\n\n\n\nThe door of the book room was pushed open, and a woman walked in with two cups of coffee and placed it on the desk\n\n\n\nZhou Ze looked at the woman, and the woman also looked at Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nNext moment,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's mind suddenly moved, and the woman's face changed suddenly\n\n\n\n\"What, do you know?\" Wang Qi asked\n\n\n\n\"Well, he is Dr. Lin's husband, Xu Le,\" the woman replied\n\n\n\n\"Ah\" Wang Qi stood up with some surprise.\n\n\n\n  Attack and shake hands with Zhou Cheng to express his gratitude.\n\n\n\nThe man in front of him was the patient who was his late young introduction. Now, he is the savior of his daughter, so the relationship is naturally closer.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was perfunctorily dealing with it, actually thinking that he should not remind himself of his hair that was devoted to his business. His wife has been addicted to the indescribable \"hair burning\" activity recently.\n\n\n\nAfter thinking about it, I would like to remind me anonymously after I left. Although I said that after I joined the work, they both focused on their work because they knew their own personalities, so they did not fight each other.\n\n\n\nThe relationship has not changed from childhood memory, but they have never had the habit of drinking, drinking, tea and chatting together one day. In fact, if it weren't for the problem this time, Zhou Ze wouldn't have come to Wang Fu.\n\n\n\nHe is married, Zhou Cheng doesn't know, he has a child, Zhou Cheng doesn't know, but when he needs help, he reports his name and the other party will definitely answer.\n\n\n\nWang Fu and his wife sent Zhou Ze out of the monk's door. Zhou Ze refused to let Wang Fu start the car and send him back.\n\n\n\n\"Love, what did he come to you for doing?\"\n\n\n\n\"Take a doctor\" Wang Fu replied, \"You said that he opened a bookstore.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, a bookstore similar to a tea party\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, I'll go and have a chance.\"\n\n\n\n …………\n\n\n\nZhou Ze just walked out of the scope of this villa.\n\n\n\nSuddenly I felt something, stopped walking, turned around, and looked at the villa behind me\n\n\n\nOn the balcony of the villa,\n\n\n\nStanding a little rooster,\n\n\n\nShe held her white bear doll, wearing red pajamas, and stood outside and blew the wind\n\n\n\nHer hair was whispering and her skirt was flying. She was still not moving, as if she could not notice it.\n\n\n\nJust those two eyes,\n\n\n\nKeep falling on myselfZhou Ze's face was solemn at first, and his body became a little nervous.\n\n\n\nBut slowly, the tightness began to fade away, and the pressure on Xu Le's mind was also resolved by the just talk. Zhou Ze was very relaxed\n\n\n\nBut what made Zhou Ze a little difficult was that\n\n\n\nIt seems that he not only wants to remind himself to ask his wife about his problem,\n\n\n\nHis daughter,\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a problem, too\n\n\n\nSilently, Zhou Ze became accustomed to himself in his heart.\n\n\n\nSome heartache\n\n\n\nWhat kind of evil did the uploader do to have such a \"happy and beautiful\" family\n\n\n\nAs soon as he thought of this, Zhou Ze showed a bitter smile on his lips\n\n\n\nThe next moment, facing Xiao Luoli's gaze on the remote sun,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze started,\n\n\n\n  Shut down in that direction:\n\n\n\nHe said:\n\n\n\n  \"Hi\"",

    "content": "Leaving the villa district, Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to hail a cab, deciding instead to take a walk by himself through the streets at night.\n\nWang Ke had said his side of things wasn't a big problem; he just needed to sever Xu Le's old network of connections. Of course, at this point, it was basically already severed.\n\nAfter the way he'd treated Dr. Lin, he figured she wouldn't be speaking to him for some time. As for his in-laws' place, he hadn't been back in several days either.\n\nThe only tricky part was probably his bookstore. After all, the money to open it had come from his wife's family.\n\nHe'd just let things be for now. He needed some time to cool down anyway.\n\nUp ahead was a footbridge. Zhou Ze walked up it and sat down on one of the steps. He took out his phone and scrolled through it casually.\n\nAs luck would have it, Zhou Ze opened that live-streaming app. Xu Le had followed a lot of gaming and beauty-section streamers, but Zhou Ze wasn't very interested in any of them. Scrolling down, he saw that the old Taoist priest streamer he had watched last time still wasn't broadcasting.\n\nHe hadn't streamed in so long, he had probably quit for good.\n\nThe streaming industry looked easy—making money while sitting at home—but the pressure was immense. Forget one or two months of not streaming; even just a few days off could make you fade into obscurity.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze noticed an unread message in his account. He opened it and found it was a private message from the old Taoist priest, sent the day before yesterday.\n\n“This humble priest is in Tongcheng. Dear, wanna meet up?”\n\nBelow the message was the old Taoist's phone number.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. Besides the message, the old Taoist had also sent a lot of little heart emojis. Zhou Ze then checked the profile information for this account of Xu Le's.\n\nFemale account.\n\nAnd the location was set to Tongcheng.\n\nIt seemed Xu Le had tried her hand at streaming before, so she had her own channel, but her popularity was dismal.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood where that strange feeling was coming from. The old Taoist's message clearly had the vibe of a streamer looking to hook up with a fan. He'd come to Tongcheng for some reason, looked up his fans in the city, and was casting a wide net to see what he could catch.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't interested in this old Taoist. What he was interested in was the young man who had appeared in the old Taoist's video, the one who had difficulty drinking congee.\n\nStill, Zhou Ze sent a reply with his own number.\n\nHe stood up, stretched, and got ready to leave. He was starting to miss his freezer.\n\nBut just then, his phone rang.\n\nHe picked it up. The caller ID showed a number from Rongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze answered the phone.\n\n\"Hello, Patron, where are you!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's voice was very loud, as if he were shouting into the phone's speaker. It sounded like there was a train in the background.\n\n\"Where are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWas this old Taoist really that free? Didn't he have a lot of fans? How did he manage to reply to his message so quickly every time?\n\nWas the \"female fan\" label really that appealing?\n\n\"Huh...\" The old Taoist was taken aback. He was silent for a moment, not expecting the fan he planned to meet up with to be a man!\n\nA... c-cute girl with a dick!¹\n\nHeartbroken,\n\nDisappointed,\n\nCrestfallen!\n\nBut the old Taoist immediately changed his tone, wailing with all his might:\n\n\"Big bro, I'm starving! Begging for a few beers and a bite to eat!\"\n\n...\n\nTaking a cab over, Zhou Ze found the old Taoist in a nook under a railway bridge. The priest was wearing a filthy Taoist robe, his hair was a mess, and his face was slightly bruised—the very image of a refugee. He had been lying on a plastic sheet on the ground.\n\nNearby on the street was a restaurant called \"Longtan Homestyle Cooking.\" Zhou Ze ordered him two bowls of noodles, a plate of Kung Pao Chicken, and a plate of small assorted fish. The old Taoist ate with great gusto.\n\n\"Brother, you're a real one!\" The old Taoist finished one bowl of noodles and finally started to slow down. He then asked the owner to warm a pot of yellow wine and smiled apologetically at Zhou Ze. He barely had any money left; Zhou Ze would definitely be paying for this meal.\n\n\"How did you end up like this, old man?\" A glass of water sat in front of Zhou Ze. He hadn't touched a single bite of the food on the table.\n\n\"Sigh, don't ask.\" The old Taoist took a sip of noodle soup and smacked his lips. \"Just a bout of bad luck. I originally came to Tongcheng with a film crew for a shoot.\"\n\n\"Changed careers?\"\n\n\"I guess you could say that. I haven't felt like streaming lately.\" The old Taoist sighed. \"A man's gotta have dreams, right?\"\n\n\"True,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This humble priest's dream for the future is to act in a *Mr. Vampire* movie, whether it's part three, four, five, or six, seven, eight.\" As he spoke of his dream, the old Taoist's whole demeanor seemed to change slightly.\n\n\"You ended up like this from working on a film set?\" Zhou Ze asked, a bit curious.\n\n\"Heh heh, I was actually a minor supporting actor in the crew, but who knew fate could be so cruel.\"\n\nThe wine arrived.\n\nThe old Taoist first poured a cup for Zhou Ze, then filled his own. He took a small sip, his eyes narrowing:\n\n\"Tsk tsk, beautiful, just beautiful.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his plain water and took another sip.\n\n\"The assistant director was a real piece of work. He tried to use the casting couch on a young actress, the girl probably wasn't even eighteen. Sigh, the kid was crying, she didn't want to do it.\n\n\"This old priest happened to walk in on it and gave that assistant director a beating.\"\n\nThe old Taoist patted his own chest and said:\n\n\"Making money is making money, getting famous is getting famous, but no matter what we do, we can't go against our conscience, right?\n\n\"Tell me, buddy, am I right?\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" Zhou Ze grunted. \"So you got fired?\"\n\n\"Nah, he didn't dare use that as the reason.\" The old Taoist continued smiling, a grin on his face. \"A lot of people knew I beat him up. He wouldn't dare use that against me, or his own reputation would be ruined.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then, the next night, the young actress I'd saved walked into the assistant director's room on her own and didn't come out all night.\"\n\nThe old Taoist sounded wistful as he said this. \"They're all pitiful people, all just trying to get by.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then the young actress accused me of groping her, of taking advantage of her. The assistant director didn't show his face, but the main director kicked me out of the crew.\" The old Taoist was still smiling, but there was a bitterness in it now.\n\n\"Have a drink,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Come on, let's have one!\" The old Taoist raised his cup. Seeing that Zhou Ze was holding plain water, he immediately said, \"You looking down on your big brother? Let's have a drink. Your brother has fallen on hard times today, and I'm grateful for your help. The world is small; one day when I have money again, I'll return the favor.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm allergic to alcohol.\"\n\n\"Alright then, tea will do for wine!\"\n\nThe two clinked their cups, and the old Taoist downed his in one gulp.\n\nLife's grievances, wasted time, frustrations, injustices, and all the rest,\n\nwere all in that one cup of wine.\n\n\"You're out of money?\" Zhou Ze asked, though the question was unnecessary.\n\n\"Yeah.\" After saying this, the old Taoist looked at him expectantly, hoping Zhou Ze would lend him some money. He originally had some saved up, but he had donated it all at the beginning of the month. Now that he'd lost his job, he was suddenly broke.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist suddenly felt that this person's way of conversing was vaguely familiar.\n\n*What the fuck*, he thought, *you just say \"oh,\" so why even ask if I have money?*\n\nZhou Ze stood up, went to pay the bill, and then prepared to leave. He had treated the old Taoist to a meal purely because he was a bit bored tonight and wanted to find someone to talk to.\n\nHe could have gone back to find Xu Qinglang, but Xu Qinglang had closed up early tonight, his rolling shutter door was already down, so he couldn't find him.\n\nNow, he was tired and wanted to go back and rest.\n\n\"Buddy, you run a bookstore?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\"Bookstores don't make much money, do they?\" The old Taoist held out his palm and pinched his fingertips together as if doing a calculation.\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\"This humble priest thinks opening a spirit money shop is more profitable.\" Seeing that Zhou Ze didn't seem very interested in his \"divination,\" the old Taoist gave up. *Right, this guy is one of those 'born under the red flag' types who doesn't give a damn about feudal superstitions.*\n\n\"A spirit money shop?\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Not interested.\"\n\nHe was a ghost himself, why would he open a spirit money shop?\n\n\"To be honest with you, this old priest used to run a spirit money shop back in Rongcheng.\" The old Taoist pulled a stack of bills from his pocket—it was joss paper. \"Buddy, thanks for the meal today. Your big brother doesn't have much to give you. Take this stack of joss paper. Don't rush to curse me out. Of course you can't spend this money, but it has Yin-virtue on it. Just carry it with you. Don't be afraid of bad juju, it can bring you some good luck.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't reach for the money.\n\nWhat kind of idiot would carry a stack of joss paper on him?\n\n\"Brother, don't be a non-believer.\" Seeing that Zhou Ze didn't want it, the old Taoist got anxious. He yanked open his robe and pointed at a scar on the right side of his chest. \"It was a wad of joss paper that saved my life back then.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine, I'll take it.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to watch a grown man baring his chest at him, so he had no choice but to reach out and take the joss paper.\n\n\"I remember from your video, there was another person in the spirit money shop. That person, he had a hard time drinking congee,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, him. He's an employee I hired. Lazy as hell, all he does all day is sunbathe, never does a lick of work. I yell at him every day, telling him he can't be so lazy at his young age.\"\n\n\"Oh, does he have anorexia?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I guess you could say that.\" The old Taoist seemed a bit down when he spoke of that person. \"What, is he handsome?\"\n\n\"No, I just felt a sense of familiarity.\"\n\n\"Familiar, my ass.\" The old Taoist sounded like he'd just heard a hilarious joke.\n\n*You feel a sense of kinship with a ghost? Don't tell me you're a ghost too?*\n\n*Hahahahahahaha,*\n\n*You're killing this humble priest!*\n\nThe two of them walked out of the restaurant. Zhou Ze offered the old Taoist a cigarette. The supermarket next door was still open, with a small fruit stall set up at the entrance.\n\n\"You stand here and don't move, I'll go buy you some oranges,\"² the old Taoist said, joking around.\n\n\"I'll just eat two, you can have the rest,\"³ Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What?\" The old Taoist thought Zhou Ze was a bit out of the loop and didn't get his joke. He found it a bit dull; this bookstore owner must be a bookworm.\n\nZhou Ze didn't explain.\n\nIn reality, \"I'll go buy you some oranges, you stand here and don't move\" is what a father says to his son in Zhu Ziqing's essay *My Father's Back*.\n\nAnd what Zhou Ze said was what a grandfather says to his grandson in *Rickshaw Boy*.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze reached out and patted the old Taoist on the shoulder. \"I'm leaving. Take care.\"\n\nJust as the old Taoist was about to say something,\n\nhe suddenly clutched his crotch.\n\nThen, the smell of burnt hair wafted out.\n\n\"Mother of God, it's burning this humble priest to death!\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ A Chinese internet slang term, `大屌萌妹` (dà diǎo méng mèi), which literally means \"cute girl with a big dick.\" It refers to a \"trap\" or a male pretending to be a female online.\n\n² This is a line from the famous Chinese essay *My Father's Back* (《背影》) by Zhu Ziqing. The father says this to his son before parting. On the modern Chinese internet, it has become a popular meme where the speaker jokingly calls the listener their \"son.\"\n\n³ This is a line from the novel *Rickshaw Boy* (《駱駝祥子》) by Lao She. A grandfather says this to his grandson. Zhou Ze is playing along with the old Taoist's joke and one-upping him by implying the old Taoist is his \"grandson.\"",

    "content": "\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze frowned. Clearly, he had smelled it too.\n\n\"Nothing, I have to pee. You go on ahead!\"\n\nWith that, the old Taoist immediately turned and ran off.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his own hand, didn't follow to ask anything more, and instead hailed a cab straight back to the bookstore.\n\nThe old Taoist reached the side of the road and pulled a talisman from his crotch. The paper had already turned red, and upon meeting the wind, it disintegrated into ash and scattered.\n\nThis was an ancestral talisman passed down through the old Taoist's family. As for why it was hidden in that particular spot... well, that's something best not explained to outsiders.\n\nBut that last scene was now seared into the old Taoist's memory.\n\nOf course, looking down at his walnuts, which had been scalded and shriveled together...\n\n...it was also seared onto his own flesh.\n\n\"Damn it all, Boss, I never would've thought I'd run into one of your kind¹ in Tongcheng, over two thousand kilometers away.\"\n\nIn the great unseen,\nperhaps there was a kind of connection.\n\nJust like when Zhou Ze was watching the old Taoist's livestream and saw the young man sitting behind the spirit shop counter, struggling to drink porridge, he felt a strange, inexplicable empathy.\n\nIt was more than just simple anorexia.\n\nIn truth,\nthey were the same kind of person.\n\nIn this world, he was not the absolute, one-of-a-kind anomaly.\n\nJust as the Faceless Woman had roared in unwilling fury in Hell:\n\n\"How can you leave too?\"\n\nThis meant that,\nit wasn't just Zhou Ze; someone else had left from before the Faceless Woman in the past.\n\nAdd to that the old man with the black fingernails whom Zhou Ze had saved after the car accident...\n\nThis world...\n...it really wasn't as peaceful as one might imagine.\n\n..................\n\nBy the time he took a cab back to the bookstore, it was already one in the morning. Zhou Ze cleaned up the glass shards on the bathroom floor, then boiled a few kettles of water and managed to give himself a sponge bath with a towel.\n\nHe decided he would have someone come tomorrow to install a shower head so he could wash himself properly. For someone with mild OCD, not being able to shower was absolute torture.\n\nReturning to the second floor, Zhou Ze set the temperature and lay down inside, closing his eyes, ready to bid farewell to the day's exhaustion and all its troubles.\n\nHe slept soundly and peacefully that night.\n\nThe night passed without incident.\n\nWhen he woke the next morning, Zhou Ze emerged from the freezer, went to wash up, and then opened the shop door, glancing next door.\n\nThe shop next door was closed again today.\n\nHe couldn't contact Dr. Lin for the time being.\n\nHis wife is gone,\nand now he's gone too.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head sharply. Damn it, why would he even have a thought like that?\n\nThe remnants of Xu Le were a bad influence.\nYes,\nthat had to be it.\n\nHaving eaten nothing since last night, Zhou Ze could only take out his phone and order takeout, adding a note for the restaurant to include extra vinegar.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, a young man in a yellow delivery uniform arrived on an electric scooter. He pushed open the shop door, walked right in, and handed the food to Zhou Ze, who was sitting behind the counter reading a book.\n\n\"Thanks. It can't be easy, having to deliver food during the New Year,\" Zhou Ze said politely.\n\n\"You don't have it easy either, having to eat takeout during the New Year,\" the delivery guy shot back.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt like he'd taken an arrow to the knee. He looked up and took a good look at the delivery guy. He was very young, probably in his early twenties.\n\n\"Is this a bookstore?\" The delivery guy glanced around the shop. \"The kind where you can sit and read? How much is it?\"\n\n\"Pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said, opening the takeout bag.\n\n\"Alrighty then.\"\n\nThe delivery guy sat down on a plastic stool, found a copy of *Battle Through the Heavens*², and started reading with great relish.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, chugged the vinegar the restaurant had sent. Perhaps because he'd been recently trained by the freakishly sour plum juice from Xu Qinglang's place, Zhou Ze felt this ordinary vinegar didn't have much of an effect.\n\nHe then began to wolf down his food. Halfway through, the nausea and urge to vomit began to rise.\n\nZhou Ze clamped his hands around his own neck, forcing himself not to throw up. Finally, after a terrible standoff, the nausea slowly began to subside. Zhou Ze wiped his mouth and began to cough heavily.\n\n\"Bro, eat slower. The way you're eating... my grandma would say you look like a reincarnated hungry ghost.\"\n\nThe delivery guy commented while still looking at his book.\n\nZhou Ze shot him a glare and simply sat on his chair, panting. He needed a moment.\n\nDamn that Xu Qinglang.\n\nWhy isn't he open yet!\n\nZhou Ze decided that if he wasn't open by the afternoon, he'd have no choice but to break down the door and look for the leftover sour plum juice or bitter melon juice. Otherwise, he really wouldn't be able to get this meal down.\n\nThe delivery guy seemed to have stopped taking orders, sitting there and reading his novel for an hour.\n\n\"Huh, why do I smell something like burning coal?\" the delivery guy suddenly sniffed, then walked outside the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think much of it. The guy probably wanted to read for a bit without paying, which was fine.\n\nThis bookstore's profitability was really up to fate.\n\nBut then, the delivery guy, who had just stepped outside, immediately opened his mouth and yelled:\n\n\"Whoa, it's a fire!\"\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze snap to attention. He also ran out of the shop and looked up, his gaze instantly hardening. On the fourth floor of the building above, thick smoke was billowing out.\n\nThat was...\nthe cinema's location!\n\nThe only part of the once-bustling commercial center that still had some life was that cinema. And with the New Year's blockbusters out, many people had been coming to watch movies recently.\n\n\"Come on, let's go save people,\" the delivery guy said, immediately sprinting in that direction.\n\nZhou Ze stood there, hesitating for ten seconds. The fire was clearly serious, but it definitely wouldn't burn down to his bookstore. He was trying to suppress the instinct deep within him to go and help.\n\nIn the past, he couldn't remember how many times he had rushed to the front lines of a disaster scene to participate in rescue efforts. But recently, he had been planning to break this bad habit.\n\nHowever, after a fierce internal struggle, Zhou Ze ran after him anyway.\n\nMe...\nI guess I'm just a sucker!\n\nOn the staircase from the first to the third floor, many people were running down, while Zhou Ze ran up.\n\nAlthough this commercial center was \"dead,\" it was located in the city center, so fire trucks should arrive quickly.\n\nFewer people watched movies in the morning than in the afternoon, but the number was still significant. By the time Zhou Ze ran up the stairs to the fourth floor, he saw that the smoke inside was much thicker, and the fire was burning strangely. Even if it was an accident, it couldn't possibly be burning this wildly!\n\nBut this wasn't the time to analyze the cause. Through the thick smoke, Zhou Ze saw the delivery guy, his face blackened with soot, carrying an old woman out on his back.\n\nThe guy glanced at Zhou Ze, smiled, revealing a set of white teeth, then turned and ran back towards the theater halls to rescue more people.\n\nThe fire hadn't completely spread out yet, but in the theater area, it was raging ferociously.\n\nZhou Ze didn't hesitate any longer. Since he was already here, he had to do something. He immediately ran into the thick smoke.\n\n\"*Cough cough... cough cough...*\"\n\nWithout any protective gear, rushing in like this was a foolish move. It was easy to fail to save anyone and end up getting yourself killed.\n\nSo Zhou Ze knew his time was limited. If he saw someone who needed help, he would just bring them out. He couldn't do much else; he could only wait for professional firefighters to handle the rest.\n\n\"*Whoosh...*\"\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze opened the door to Theater 2, flames shot straight out at him. Zhou Ze had to step back to avoid the brunt of it.\n\nAnd inside, there were still cries for help.\n\nZhou Ze gritted his teeth and charged straight in. Inside the theater, there were flames everywhere—on the floor, the ceiling, the walls. And because of the confined space, the thick smoke generated by the fire could only collect here.\n\nIn most fire scenes, more victims die from smoke inhalation than from being burned.\n\nOnly at a time like this did people realize how important those annoying fire safety announcement videos before every movie were.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze rushed in, he saw two people lying in the small aisle space.\n\nOne was an adult male in a black suit. He was on the ground, coughing, clearly unable to get up.\n\nThe other was a boy of about ten, lying unconscious on the ground. It was impossible to tell if he had just fainted or had already suffocated.\n\n\"Help me... help me... save...\" the man in the suit managed to lift his head, looking at Zhou Ze standing before him.\n\nZhou Ze went right past him, lifted the little boy onto his back, and prepared to rush out.\n\nHe was already feeling dizzy. Clearly, without professional equipment like a gas mask, he couldn't last much longer either.\n\nHowever, just as he was about to run out with the boy on his back, Zhou Ze felt a tug on his ankle. He fell to the ground, and the boy on his back tumbled off.\n\n\"Save... save... me... first... I'll... give you... money... save... me... first...\"\n\nThe man in the suit used his last bit of strength to grip Zhou Ze's ankle tightly. He knew he couldn't hold on much longer. He couldn't breathe at all right now; his lungs felt like they were on fire.\n\nHaving fallen, Zhou Ze felt the world spin, almost passing out. Instantly, he bit the tip of his own tongue, forcing himself to stay conscious.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nZhou Ze used his other foot to kick the hand of the man gripping him, as well as the man's head.\n\nAfter a few consecutive kicks, the man finally let go.\n\nZhou Ze staggered back to his feet, heaved the boy onto his back, and charged out of Theater 2.\n\nAs he burst out of the billowing smoke and into a safe area, Zhou Ze's knees gave out, and he collapsed, kneeling. The boy on his back fell off, but because Zhou Ze had subconsciously cushioned the fall, it wasn't a bad one.\n\nFirefighters had already arrived and were beginning to extinguish the fire. Another group of firefighters in full gear was rushing into the blaze.\n\n\"There's still someone in Theater 2.\"\n\nZhou Ze said, grabbing the uniform of a firefighter running past him.\n\n\"Okay, got it,\" the man nodded and charged into the fire.\n\n\"*Haa... haa... haa... haa...*\"\n\nZhou Ze lay sprawled on the tiled floor, gasping for breath. Opposite him, the delivery guy, his yellow uniform now scorched black, was also leaning against the wall, panting. The two made eye contact and managed a weak, exhausted smile.\n\nParamedics had also arrived—a group of doctors and nurses in white. Zhou Ze no longer had the strength to see if Dr. Lin was part of this rescue operation.\n\nGritting his teeth, he got back up. Zhou Ze glanced at the boy who was receiving emergency treatment from a doctor. The boy's chest was still rising and falling; he should be fine.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze saw several other people being carried out by firefighters. Some were saved, some weren't. The man in the black suit was lying motionless on a stretcher; he was likely gone.\n\nZhou Ze felt no guilt. He had no reason to.\n\nHe was doing a good deed, saving people, but who he saved first was up to him. No one had the right to morally strong-arm him.\n\nBesides, at that moment, he was in no condition to carry a child on his back while also hauling an adult male out. If he had tried, the only result would have been his own death in there.\n\nThe body he had reanimated belonged to Xu Le, a \"scholar\" who couldn't even truss a chicken, not Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nWhat's more, that guy had almost gotten him killed in the cinema too.\n\nHe struggled to his feet, refusing the help of a nearby nurse who wanted to check his condition. Zhou Ze walked to the restroom at the other end of the building, turned on the faucet, and vigorously splashed cold water on his face.\n\nFinally,\nhe had caught his breath.\n\nLifting his head,\nZhou Ze looked at himself in the mirror.\n\nSuddenly, he noticed,\nin the mirror, behind him, a faint human figure was slowly appearing.\n\nThis person,\nwas wearing a black suit,\nstaring at him with a face full of venomous hatred.\n\nHis mouth was open, screaming something ceaselessly, as if questioning him, hysterical, frenzied, and agitated.\n\nWhen a person dies, under specific circumstances, there's a chance they might turn into a vengeful ghost to seek revenge.\n\nRight now, this man had just died. His soul was still in the process of becoming a ghost; it would probably take full form around the seventh day after his death³.\n\nHe wasn't a ghost yet, just a nascent form.\n\nBut because of Zhou Ze's own special nature, he could perceive the man's existence ahead of time.\n\nHe hated him.\nFor not saving him.\nAnd this hatred was so strong,\nit was turning him into a vengeful ghost!\n\n\"Heh, interesting.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nHe lowered his head back into the sink and continued to rinse his face with water.\n\nAt the same time, he sighed inwardly:\n\n\"Heh, people...\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **One of your kind:** The original term is `老鄉` (lǎo xiāng), which literally means \"fellow townsman\" or someone from the same hometown. However, in this supernatural context, the old Taoist is using it to mean \"someone of the same nature\" as Zhou Ze, i.e., another being connected to the underworld.\n2.  ***Battle Through the Heavens***: The original is `《斗破蒼穹》` (Dòu Pò Cāngqióng), one of the most famous Chinese web novels.\n3.  **Seventh day after his death:** The original term is `頭七` (tóu qī), a crucial concept in Chinese folk religion. It is believed that the soul of the deceased will return home on the seventh day after death. It is a critical period in the transition from human to ghost.",

    "title": "Chapter Twenty-Six: The First Seven Days",
    "content": "According to the Jianghai Evening News (a local Tongcheng newspaper), seven people died in the cinema fire, and more than thirty were injured to varying degrees.\n\nA week had passed. The cinema had been closed down, and reopening anytime soon was impossible. It was even likely that the theater would be abandoned for good. It had been losing money even when it was open, so there was naturally no reason to go through the trouble of a grand reopening.\n\nWith that, this commercial complex was basically pronounced dead.\n\nDuring this time, Zhou Ze hadn't contacted Dr. Lin again. Both sides maintained a tacit understanding of mutual non-interference, each living their own life. His father-in-law and mother-in-law, however, had called several times, questioning why Zhou Ze wasn't coming home, had he gotten too big for his britches, and so on.\n\nEventually, Zhou Ze simply blocked their numbers.\n\nThe biggest headache now was that the money to open this bookstore had come from his wife's family. *Having eaten their food, his mouth was soft; having taken their things, his hands were weak.*¹ Zhou Ze just couldn't figure out a way to earn some money so he could open a new shop and be truly independent.\n\nAll he could say was that the foundation Xu Le had left him was just too poor.\n\nSeveral media outlets had contacted him, hoping to interview Zhou Ze about his heroic deed and promote some new-era positive energy, but he had refused them all.\n\nHe had no interest in that kind of fame. As the saying goes, a tall tree attracts the wind. Given his identity and role, turning himself into some kind of celebrity would only create more uncontrollable dangers.\n\nFor the past week, business had been unremarkable. Daily sales were less than a hundred yuan, not even enough to cover rent and utilities. Zhou Ze, however, wasn't too concerned about that.\n\nWhat he was concerned about was that his next-door neighbor, Xu Qinglang, hadn't opened his shop for a week.\n\nZhou Ze hired an unscrupulous locksmith to pick the lock. He went inside and searched everywhere but found no sour plum juice or anything of the sort. The kitchen in the back room had been tidied up and was spotless and neat.\n\nIt was quite helpless, really.\nA man who owned over twenty properties and was incredibly handsome,\nif he suddenly decided to renounce the mortal world and go chase the wind with carefree abandon,\nyou'd have a very hard time finding him.\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze's week had been pretty miserable.\n\nChili oil,\naged black vinegar,\ndark soy sauce,\nhigh-concentration orange juice, and other methods had all been tried. Although they allowed him to get some food down, they all made him miserable. The effect was far inferior to the Xu family's heirloom sour plum juice.\n\nAs night fell, Zhou Ze squatted alone at the entrance of his bookstore, a cigarette dangling from his lips. His gaze occasionally glanced next door, projecting a sense of \"where in this life can one speak of desolation?\"\n\nBy the road in front of the shop, four or five pagoda incenses were burning. The people from the shopping center had set them up. According to custom, today was the day to welcome the God of Wealth. Even though they knew the God of Wealth could hardly save this shopping center, the gestures still had to be made.\n\nWhat if a miracle happened?\n\nFrom time to time, Zhou Ze would look behind him or at his reflection in the glass in front.\nThe vengeful ghost of the man in the black suit was continuously taking shape. Tonight was his head-seven; it should be just about complete.\n\nThe materialization of a vengeful ghost was an event with an infinitesimally small probability to begin with. Besides, an ordinary vengeful ghost could, at most, make you trip while walking or bite your tongue while eating. Making you catch a minor illness that required two days on an IV drip would be considered an impressive feat for a vengeful ghost.\n\nThe kind of thing you see in movies, with vengeful ghosts running rampant and killing people everywhere, would be impossible in reality. Otherwise, the mortal world would have descended into chaos long ago.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, who had already returned to life in another's body, was keeping such a low profile.\nHow dare those pieces of trash with no physical bodies come out and act all high and mighty?\n\nThis past week, when he had nothing to do, Zhou Ze would read, daze off, trim his nails, and occasionally check if the vengeful ghost behind him had become any clearer.\nIt felt rather like... raising something. He was getting a taste of fatherly love as vast as a mountain.\n\nDaddy loves you,\nDaddy's waiting for you to grow up.\n\nZhou Ze could clearly perceive the emotions of the one behind him. His greatest hatred was not directed at the cause of the fire, but at Zhou Ze himself. He was resentful, he was furious, he was expectant, he was waiting.\nPerhaps,\nin his view, tonight, the day of his head-seven, would be his moment of revenge.\n\nInteresting.²\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette. Once the ghost had fully formed, Zhou Ze would show him why the flowers are so red.³\n\nRegarding the rescue, Zhou Ze didn't feel he had done anything wrong. Nor did he think the man in the suit was wrong to hate him.\n\nOnce, Zhou Ze had encountered a similar incident. A person was drowning, and someone went in to save them. But the rescuer was grabbed tightly by the drowning person, and they both drowned together.\nGenerally speaking, when saving someone from the water, you have to approach from behind and hold them to rescue them. If you approach from the front, it's very easy for the drowning person to clutch you like a last-ditch lifeline.\n\nOf course, he could understand it.\nBut understanding wouldn't be a reason for Zhou Ze to allow the man in the suit to run wild in his bookstore at midnight tonight.\n\nDuring the day, Zhou Ze had ordered takeout. He chatted a bit with the new delivery guy and learned that the delivery guy who had helped with the rescue had become famous recently. Not only was he attending all sorts of award ceremonies, but he was also praised and rewarded by his company. He now had a nickname—\"The Most Handsome Delivery Guy.\" He was still delivering food, but now he did it while live-streaming, and his popularity was very high.\n\nWhile eating his meal and chugging aged black vinegar, Zhou Ze casually scrolled through Weibo and actually saw the delivery guy on the hot search list.\n\nA week had passed since the incident. From the initial handling and summary, it had now moved to the promotion and celebration of positive energy. The topic was at its peak of popularity, and the incident's influence had spread not just through Tongcheng, but across the entire country.\n\nAt eleven o'clock at night, Zhou Ze was watching a movie while also watching the man in the suit slowly become more solid. The movie was called *That Demon Within*, a work from a few years ago by the now-famous director Dante Lam, starring Daniel Wu and Nick Cheung.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. The delivery guy, in his uniform, walked in while holding a selfie stick.\n\n\"This is a bookstore I often come to. After a busy day of deliveries, I always come to this shop to read. It's not for any profound knowledge, I just simply like to read.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the delivery guy took a copy of Wen Tiejun's *Eight Crises* from the shelf.\n\nThe book is about modern China's various economic crises. The delivery guy opened the book, sat down on a plastic stool, and began to read with great interest.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that the last time he came, he had read two volumes of *Battle Through the Heavens*.\n\n\"Alright, that's all for today's stream. I want to read quietly for a while. Everyone should get some rest, too. Thanks for keeping me company all day.\" The delivery guy bowed to his phone screen.\n\nA flood of subscriptions, airplanes, and rockets scrolled across the phone screen. His popularity was indeed terrifyingly high.\n\nAfter turning off his phone, the delivery guy closed the copy of *Eight Crises* in his hands, stretched, looked at Zhou Ze, and said:\n\n\"Boss, let's go grab a late-night snack. My treat.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and pointed at his computer screen.\n\n\"What are you watching?\" The delivery guy leaned in closer. After looking at the screen, he smiled. \"I've seen this movie. *That Demon Within*, right?\"\n\n\"Mhm.\" Zhou Ze nodded, simultaneously glancing at the time in the bottom-right corner of the screen. It was almost midnight.\n\nThe \"baby\" behind him was getting a little impatient.\n\n\"Didn't any reporters interview you?\" the delivery guy asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You really should have. Your bookstore's business would be a lot better.\"\n\n\"I like peace and quiet,\" Zhou Ze said insincerely, striking a pretentious pose.\n\nMoney was important, but his life was more important.\n\n\"You can watch the movie later.\" The delivery guy seemed to feel a connection with Zhou Ze. After all, they were comrades who had rushed into a fire together.\nThere was a sense of,\nwell, mutual admiration between heroes.\n\n\"Did you know? *That Demon Within* is based on a true story. The real protagonist's name was something like Tsui Po-ko,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Heh, I actually didn't know that.\" The delivery guy smiled a little sheepishly. \"I'm just watching a movie, who pays attention to that stuff?\"\n\n\"Mhm, that's true.\" Zhou Ze closed the computer and stretched. \"It's so late, what do you want to eat?\"\n\n\"Whatever's fine.\"\n\n\"I'll order some takeout then.\"\n\n\"No, let's go out. My treat. Takeout's no good. Let me tell you, the back kitchens of some of those places are unbearable to look at. And some vendors don't even have a physical store, they just rent a rundown place and cook there. Tsk, tsk, I wouldn't dare eat it, anyway.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"By the way, do you know what happened with Tsui Po-ko?\"\n\n\"I'll know once you tell me, won't I?\"\n\n\"He killed his colleague, took the money, and then lived a carefree life. He even appeared on TV shows. He liked being in the spotlight, being famous.\" Zhou Ze rubbed the tip of his nose. \"A very complicated person. He really enjoyed being on camera.\"\n\nThe delivery guy was silent for a moment. He didn't continue the topic, instead saying, \"Boss, are you going for a late-night snack or not?\"\n\n\"I don't feel like it. Haven't you seen how many pagoda incenses are out front of my shop? They've been smoking me out all day. I've completely lost my appetite.\"\n\nPagoda incense is a type of large incense stick, taller than a person, layered like a pagoda. It's very thick and can burn for a long time.\n\n\"Haha, but your shop doesn't smell at all.\" The delivery guy pointed to the central air conditioning unit above Zhou Ze's bookstore. \"That's an air purifier, right?\"\n\n\"Mhm, it was installed with the air conditioner. And I'm used to spraying some air freshener in the bookstore. After all, you have to create a reading atmosphere, right? Since I don't offer coffee or pastries, the least I can do is offer a pleasant smell.\"\n\n\"So, Boss, you're still not going to do me this favor, huh?\" the delivery guy said, pretending to be angry. \"We went through life and death together, you and I.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, curious. \"So, there's something I've always been curious about.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"That day, I didn't smell a thing. In my shop, it's very difficult, almost impossible, to smell anything from outside. How did you smell the fire that day?\"\n\nThe delivery guy froze for a moment, his expression a bit unnatural. But he didn't make a big deal of it. \"I've had a good sense of smell since I was a kid. My grandma said I have a dog's nose. When I was little, I was great at finding hidden snacks at home.\"\n\n\"Do you know what day it is today?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"What day?\"\n\n\"The head-seven.\"⁴\n\n\"The head-seven?\"\n\n\"That's right. The head-seven... for the seven people who died in the fire!\"\n***\n¹ A Chinese idiom meaning one who accepts favors from others feels obligated and cannot act assertively against them.\n\n² A Chinese internet slang term that is a pun on the English word \"interesting.\"\n\n³ A line from a famous song in the 1963 Chinese film *Visitors on the Icy Mountain*. In modern slang, it implies a threat: \"I'm going to teach you a lesson so painful you'll see red (blood).\"\n\n⁴ The seventh day after a person's death. In Chinese tradition, it is believed the soul of the deceased will return home for a final visit on this day.",

    "content": "The delivery guy stood where he was, looking across the counter at Zhou Ze, who was sitting behind it.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. The store doesn't have any security cameras, and I don't have a recording pen on me,\" Zhou Ze said, stretching lazily. \"Of course, you're not going to believe me when I say that. Tsk, suit yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by that,\" the delivery guy said calmly.\n\nAnyone who could do such a thing would have to be calm.\n\nThe police still hadn't identified the arsonist, which was a testament to his skill—in a derogatory sense, of course.\n\n\"I'm absolutely certain that you were the one who set that fire.\" Zhou Ze spread his hands. He was simply stating a fact, one that required no debate.\n\n\"You're drunk,\" the delivery guy said.\n\n\"Not drunk.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Just based on that, you're saying I set the fire? You think you're better than the police?\" The delivery guy's composure was beginning to crack, but he was still restraining himself.\n\n\"Hiss... Of course I'm not better than the police, but I'm not blind. And as for claiming you're the arsonist based on *that*—sorry, but that's not it at all.\n\n\"I first confirmed you were the arsonist, and then worked backward to find the evidence. Just wanted to see what it feels like to be Conan.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed behind the delivery guy.\n\nThe delivery guy whipped his head around, thinking the police were there, but there was no one. No sound of sirens, either.\n\nIn this nearly defunct shopping mall, in the dead of night, there wasn't even a single person passing by.\n\n\"They... all followed you in here,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who?\" The delivery guy frowned.\n\n\"The six people who died in the movie theater. They followed you in, and as soon as I saw them, I went, 'Oh.' The killer is you. It's plain as day.\n\n\"Aside from the doofus standing behind me who's hell-bent on hating my guts, you can't possibly tell me the other six victims have got the wrong guy, can you?\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, looking at the delivery guy before him.\n\n\"Mumbo jumbo!\" the delivery guy practically roared. For some reason, he felt the pressure mounting, and cold sweat began to bead on his face.\n\n\"Don't be nervous. They can't harm you.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the counter, holding a plastic bag.\n\nInside the bag were small boxes of rice and some pickles.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's line of sight, six people—men and women, including two elderly individuals—were sitting on plastic stools.\n\nThey all sat there properly, reading their books, quiet and not the least bit disruptive.\n\nZhou Ze placed a bowl of rice in front of each of them, topped it with pickles, and stuck a pair of disposable chopsticks upright into the rice.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze took out a bottle of white liquor that cost less than ten yuan, poured it into plastic cups from the water dispenser, and placed a cup in front of each person.\n\n\"Hey fellas, things aren't easy for me either. This bookstore has been losing money since it opened, so this is all I can offer you. Don't think me stingy, alright? You're dead, but I still have to go on living.\n\n\"Besides, your families will make offerings to you, so you won't miss this little bit from me, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned over, speaking as casually as if he were serving regular customers.\n\nRight, as for that brain-damaged doofus behind him, Zhou Ze wasn't kind-hearted enough to leave him a share.\n\n\"Are you fucking nuts!\" The delivery guy couldn't hold it in any longer. \"Ha, I should really record this, upload it online, and let all the fans see what you're really like!\"\n\n\"You dare?\" Zhou Ze turned sideways. \"You say that as if you really would. You've only been streaming for a few days. Even Whitemilk fell.\"¹\n\nIndeed, there were many reasons the police hadn't found the arsonist yet, but if they had a primary suspect to pursue, it would be very difficult for the arsonist to stay hidden.\n\n\"I'm leaving. You've got a screw loose.\"\n\nThe delivery guy's friendly demeanor vanished. He had successfully converted his popularity into a streaming career and a huge income, not just because he was a \"hero,\" but also because of his own marketing strategies.\n\nHe was very down-to-earth, and his original public image was excellent. Building on that foundation, he had managed to make something as tedious and boring as live-streaming food deliveries an interesting spectacle for viewers.\n\nHe knew he was panicking, that he had lost his composure. So, he wanted to leave, to escape this bookstore.\n\nHe regretted coming here today, regretted it very, very much.\n\nZhou Ze didn't try to stop him. But just as the delivery guy reached out to push open the bookstore door,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, glanced at the time, and said:\n\n\"It's midnight.\"\n\n*DONG!*\n\nThere was no clock in the bookstore, but at that moment, the delivery guy felt as if he had heard a bell toll.\n\nHe pushed the door with all his might, but it didn't budge. Enraged, he glanced at the lock. It wasn't locked, and there was nothing blocking the door, but it simply wouldn't open.\n\nThe delivery guy began kicking the door like a madman, but it remained motionless.\n\nWhat he couldn't see was that,\n\nThe six people who had been sitting and reading,\n\nhad all slowly risen to their feet.\n\nThe seventh night, when the soul returns home.\n\nEvery injustice has its perpetrator, every debt its debtor.\n\nThey had come here, following their enemy,\n\nAnd now,\n\nthey were all staring intently at their killer—\n\nthe man who had become a hero after burning them to death.\n\n\"I'll teach you for not saving me!\"\n\nA low snarl came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze happened to be blowing on his nails at that exact moment. He then spun around abruptly, the nails on his right hand instantly growing long. A translucent blackness emanated an eerie luster, and wisps of black energy swirled around his fingertips, carrying a terrifying aura.\n\nAt the same time, a black mist roiled within Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n\"Ssssss... AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\"\n\nThe man in the black suit, who had just managed to transform into a vengeful spirit, was grabbed by the shoulder by Zhou Ze's hand. His entire being began to tremble as the black energy at Zhou Ze's fingertips pierced his body like countless sharp knives. Wisps of green smoke rose from the top of his head.\n\n\"I understand you, but you disgust me.\"\n\nZhou Ze said in a low voice,\n\n\"So, it's time for you to say bye-bye.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingers tightened.\n\nThe man in the black suit wailed while his face took on a pleading expression. He begged Zhou Ze to spare him. He had already become a vengeful spirit; if he \"died\" again, his soul would be shattered and scattered, without even a chance to enter Hell.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't let go.\n\nHis gaze remained icy cold.\n\nOnly after the man's body had completely melted and evaporated,\n\ndid he withdraw his hand. In his palm, faint traces of ash could be seen.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nZhou Ze blew on his palm, then clapped his hands together.\n\nTurning back around, Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nHe didn't know if it was because of his presence here that the bookstore's *feng shui* had changed,\n\nor if,\n\nthis was just a coincidence.\n\nThe six customers who had come in and been reading quietly were now emitting a black mist from their bodies, a sign that they were turning into vengeful spirits bent on revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the delivery guy was still relentlessly punching and kicking the wall.\n\n*What goes around comes around*—perhaps that phrase was meant to describe the scene right now.\n\nThese six victims had also been in a state of panic and confusion amidst the thick smoke and raging fire, ultimately failing to escape and dying a miserable death.\n\n\"Everyone, do me a favor. Don't be in such a hurry to become vengeful spirits.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked into the middle of the group and gestured to the six of them with his hands.\n\n\"Come on, relax a little. How about a smile for your bro?\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to lighten the mood. Once they became vengeful spirits, they could no longer enter the cycle of reincarnation. After taking their revenge and losing their obsession, they would simply dissipate into the wind.\n\nThat was the most tragic ending.\n\nZhou Ze felt it wasn't worth it, truly not worth it.\n\nThe arsonist had already caused your deaths, separating you from your loved ones forever. Your children lost a father or mother, your parents lost a child.\n\nThere was no need to push yourselves into an even more terrifying abyss because of the same killer.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze's words had no effect.\n\nThe six faces remained ice-cold, and the black mist around them grew thicker. Black lines began to snake from the corners of their eyes and lips.\n\nThey were about to look just like that doofus in the black suit had right before he charged at him.\n\n\"Since you won't smile for your bro, how about your bro smiles for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze forced a very ugly smile.\n\nIt was over.\n\nThis was a disaster.\n\nThey couldn't be saved.\n\nZhou Ze knew that it would be easy for him to obliterate these vengeful spirits, just like that doofus who had been following him for a week and got smacked to death the moment his cooldown ended and he was about to unleash his ultimate move.\n\nBut as for delivering these souls, he really had no idea how to do it. Besides, Zhou Ze himself was a ghost; it wasn't exactly his place to be doing such a thing. It would be like asking Zhang Fei to do embroidery.²\n\n\"The path to the netherworld is open, the Yellow Springs can be crossed!\"\n\nA sharp cry came from outside the store. The next moment, the bookstore door was pushed open, and Xu Qinglang walked in, holding a small porcelain bowl. Inside the bowl were grains of rice, with three sticks of incense stuck in them.\n\n\"Rise!\"\n\nThe three incense sticks burned down rapidly.\n\nAt the same time, the grains of rice in the bowl turned from a crystalline white to black, while the black mist around the six people began to fade. Finally, their expressions shifted from their initial cold and murderous look to one of peace and serenity.\n\nThe six of them slowly sat back down in front of their respective bowls.\n\n\"Xu Qinglang!\" Zhou Ze shouted, pointing at him.\n\nHe was excited.\n\nTruly excited.\n\nMore excited than when he saw Dr. Lin fresh from her bath.\n\nWhen he thought about how difficult it had been for him to eat this past week,\n\nhow could he not be excited!\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang's display just now, Zhou Ze wasn't surprised. In reality, they had all known about each other but had simply chosen not to point it out.\n\nXu Qinglang shot Zhou Ze a look. For an instant, it was a look of a thousand charms, as if all the rhododendrons on a mountain had burst into bloom.\n\nBut at the same time, he said irritably:\n\n\"Are you holding a New Year's Eve midnight party in here?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to.\" Zhou Ze quickly explained the situation to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded to show he understood. He clasped his hands and bowed to the six spirits.\n\n\"Everyone, it's the seventh night of the soul's return. You should go back and see your families. They should be at home waiting for you. As for what happened here, I will give you a just resolution.\"\n\nHearing this, the six of them silently passed through the glass and left.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze, however, was fixed on the bowl of \"black rice.\"\n\n\"How come this stuff has no effect on me?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth twitched. He fought back the urge to erupt and fight Zhou Ze for three hundred rounds.\n\nHe huffed:\n\n\"You're different.\"\n\nHe was still angry, still held a grudge against Zhou Ze, still felt it was unfair. But because of his looks, his disposition, and his voice, that \"You're different\" was tinged with the deep resentment of a lonely maiden in her boudoir.\n\nThen,\n\nXu Qinglang looked at the delivery guy, who had fainted and was curled up in a corner. \"What do we do with him?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Xu Qinglang made a throat-slitting gesture.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Let's just hand him over to the state.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  *Whitemilk (五五)*: A reference to Lu Benwei (盧本偉), a very famous Chinese streamer also known as \"55Kai\" or \"Whitemilk,\" who was banned from streaming. The line implies that even hugely popular streamers can fall, so a newcomer like the delivery guy should be careful.\n2.  *Zhang Fei (張飛)*: A famous general from the *Three Kingdoms* period, depicted as a fierce, brawny, and gruff warrior, the complete opposite of someone who would do delicate work like embroidery.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze finally called the police, and the police came soon. According to Zhou Ze, he said that this foreign seller suddenly had a crazy accident when he came to his store. He said that many souls of the dead came to him to revenge him, and then kept kicking and smashing the wall wildly and finally passed away.\n\n\n\nWhen the police station finished recording, it was already bright, and the cinema fire case was full of twists and turns, but now at least the situation has been opened. The police may have not suspected the foreign seller whom Yi Yong was just because of the darkness under the lights. Even if there is no accurate evidence, as long as you really look at the other party and search, the truth should be discovered soon.\n\n\n\nAs for the subsequent reversal, the reversal of the online melon-eating crowd, and the stunned people who once gave this foreign seller a gift, they are not the problems that Zhou Ze needs to worry about and think about. There is only so much he can do, and there is only so much he wants to do.\n\n\n\n  It is better to leave the ghost to solve the problem of the ghost, and it is better to leave the problem of the human being to the police to solve the problem of the problem of the human being.\n\n\n\nStanding at the door of the police station, breathing the fresh air in the morning, and feeling awake\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to the store by car, Zhou Ze saw that the store next door, Xu Qinglang had already opened its doors for business again. Xu Qinglang changed his usual clothes and sat at the door of the store, placing the dishes and sunny, and humming the \"Boy's Drama\" (local style) in his mouth, leisurely, and a stream of scented out of his own.\n\n\n\n  everything,\n\n\n\nAs if it's still\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked to the store, Xu Qinglang clapped his hands and asked, \"What to eat?\"\n\n\n\n\"Just let me take a look, I want sour plum juice.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang point\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sat down in the store, and his fingers gently tapped the tabletop\n\n\n\n  It’s not too long that Xu Qinglang brought a bowl of chicken noodles. The soup was clear and the noodles were chewy. Of course, these were not important. The most important thing was that the familiar sour plum sauce appeared in front of Zhou Ze again.\n\n\n\n\"Make me a bucket, how much does it cost?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the bucket of the drink machine in the store, \"Make one bucket first.\"\n\n\n\n\"Should you wait for a while.\" Xu Qinglang sat down in front of Zhou Ze, holding a smoke in his mouth. He seemed to want to act like a little gangster smoking and hanging posture, but he gave people a sense of discomfort that \"women can be so beautiful even if they smoke.\"\n\n\n\nHe is not a mother or gay, so he can only blame God for giving the wrong skin\n\n\n\nAfter eating the noodles with sour plum juice, it was the first time. After eating the bowl of noodles, Zhou Ze's disgust was no longer so strong, but he still drank a few more glasses of water and it was relieved.\n\n\n\n\"Remember what happened to Lin Daiyu when she first entered the Jah Mansion to eat,\" Xu Qinglang asked in a sip of smoke.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought about it and understood\n\n\n\nLin Daiyu first entered the Jah Mansion and was at the first house banquet. After the meal, the servants gave her tea soup. Lin Daiyu was taught by her father at home and was not suitable for drinking tea and it was easy to digest indigestion. However, when Jah's mother and sisters were both drunk, she could only drink it with her.\n\n\n\n  「我能吃飽了就行\"Zhou Ze was shaking his head. With his current situation, it is very likely that this person could not become a gourmet or a gourmet. As for digesting the problem, let's talk about it again\n\n\n\n\"I feel a little unbalanced.\" Xu Qinglang opened the door to see Shandi and said, \"My parents are gone.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang's parents had already left, but Zhou Ze knew what Xu Qinglang meant when he said \"left\" this time, so he should go down.\n\n\n\n\"Why did you leave suddenly?\" Zhou Cheng asked. He wanted to respond to a \"morrow\". Thinking about it, it was not suitable\n\n\n\n\"I've been discovered\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's hand holding the smoke shook slightly,\n\n\n\nHave been discovered\n\n\n\nZhou Ze remembered that before the old man died, he also shouted, \"They found me.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze, \"I am very unwilling and unbalanced. Why did she take my parents away and not take you away?\"\n\n\n\n\"He and She\" Zhou Ze's image appeared in his brain. Then, combining Xu Qinglang's state of that day and his departure at night, he guessed it.\n\n\n\n\"She, that's impossible.\"\n\n\n\n\"The order of the sect is orderly, the deceased is on the road.\" Xu Qinglang lowered his voice and stared at Zhou Ze's eyes, \"The long tongue turns into a road, and the deep throat is Xu Youming, familiar.\"\n\n\n\n\"Black and white are inconsistent\"\n\n\n\n\"That's just a singularity.\" Xu Qinglang sighed, \"But they are indeed law-enforcers, traveling to the sun and pursuing order, dividing people and ghosts, and people telling each other, and ghosts have their own way.\"\n\n\n\n  \"oh\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze still didn't believe it. If Xiao Luoli was really a Bai Wuchang identity, then what would be the death of the car and the driver before she showed her true body and spit out her long tongue on the school car.\n\n\n\n\"She didn't take me away, but instead took your parents away, so you hate me.\" Zhou Ze pointed at himself\n\n\n\n\"Yes\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the head\n\n\n\n\"Then there is no poison here.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Xu Qinglang\n\n\n\n\"Don't poison it, right?\" Zhou Ze asked again\n\n\n\n\"No\" Xu Qinglang answered\n\n\n\n\"That's good.\" Zhou Ze didn't know that in the meaty food that day, the vegetables were poisoned. If Dr. Lin hadn't come earlier that day, he might have really eaten the food.\n\n\n\n\"Are you really stupid or fake?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze with some disgrace, \"Why didn't she catch you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, why didn't she catch me?\" Zhou Ze also asked\n\n\n\n\"I'm asking you.\" Xu Qinglang raised his voice\n\n\n\n\"I don't know either.\" Zhou Ze put his hands on his back, \"Maybe, it's because I saved her once.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Xu Qinglang\n\n\n\nThe conversation between the two people was finally burned with the cigarette head as the ending sign\n\n\n\nThe two sides opened the mountain this time, breaking the original silent tacit understanding\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked back to his shop and packed up the plastic benches on the floor, he found that there were six plastic benches with uneven thicknesses underneath them.\n\n\n\nThis is whether to read books or eatZhou Ze remembered that the old master who started the live broadcast in the past also gave him a stack of sluts, saying that they could replenish sluts, so his sluts were made in this way.\n\n\n\nHow did he get it\n\n\n\nZhou Ze collected all the slights, and they were all in a whole bunch, which felt good. It was not as rough as those slights you usually see. When you touch it in your hands, it felt like a silky touch.\n\n\n\nThis made Zhou Ze think of the underworld shop as the old Taoist said, and do business with ghosts. The best store is of course the underworld shop, because the things sold there are also for the dead.\n\n\n\nTherefore, if the slightest calves in your hand are the \"slightest tickets\" for the dead, then you will definitely be able to earn more than you can\n\n\n\nIn the brain, a man sitting behind the cabinet and drinking porridge appeared again in the video screen.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that\n\n\n\nI seem to have discovered something that might be very interesting\n\n\n\nOf course, no matter how interesting things are, I don’t have the energy to take care of them now. I didn’t sleep all night last night. Now that I’m back, I have to make a good idea.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pulled the bookstore down and put it on the lock. For some reason, his bookstore is opening more at night than during the day, or maybe he has the opportunity to order another brand in the future.\n\n\n\n  Call\n\n\n\n\"Late Night Book House\"\n\n\n\nAnyway, there is no business during the day, and the bookstore has been lying on it. You can play some gimmicks and do something casually. The worst result is not the current situation.\n\n\n\nThe foreign seller's business is a serious mistake, but it also gives Zhou Ze some trouble\n\n\n\nThe bathing equipment in the sanitation room has been installed. Zhou Ze bought a water heater and took off his clothes. Zhou Ze took a shower and changed into a set of dry clothes to the building.\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze lowered his waist and prepared to adjust the temperature of the ice cabinet, the whole person was stunned.\n\n\n\nBecause in the ice cabinet in front of him,\n\n\n\nA person lying down\n\n\n\nThe other party closed his eyes, as if he was in a deep sleep, breathing smoothly, his hands crossed in front of his chest, and he felt as peaceful as a little adult.\n\n\n\nVery calm and lovely,\n\n\n\nPrerequisite is,\n\n\n\nHer tongue wouldn't have become that long\n\n\n\nXiao Luli,\n\n\n\nTake your nest for the turtle\n\n\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to shout, so that Xu Qinglang, who was next door, would get revenge\n\n\n\nBut after thinking about it, let’s forget it. It’s not that he thought that calling Xu Qinglang to revenge was a harm to him, but he thought that Xu Qinglang didn’t come to revenge, and maybe he would ask with a sincere voice when he came:\n\n\n\n\"You're awake\n\n\n\nWhat do you want to eat\n\n\n\nI'll give you a way to do it.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli opened her eyes quietly. Her eyes were very deep, no longer the clear and simple way she had seen before.\n\n\n\nThe other party stretched out his hand, and Zhou Ze helped him open the ice cabinet.Xiao Luoli sat up from inside, and Zhou Ze noticed that she actually did not set the temperature, but just chose a ventilation and air conditioning.\n\n\n\n\"You are lying here, not cold.\" Xiao Luoli, who was sitting in the ice cabinet, asked. Before Zhou Ze could answer, Xiao Luoli opened her mouth again, \"Oh, I forgot, you are different.\"\n\n\n\nAfter saying that, Xiao Luoli, who was sitting in the ice cabinet, reached out and patted the empty space beside her, and looked at Zhou Ze innocently:\n\n\n\n\"Can you sleep together\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze reached out to rub the girl's head, but his hand was next to him and stopped.\n\n\n\nShe is an invariable existence in black and white, and is the wizard of the sage among people.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli reached out, and her little hand grabbed Zhou Ze's big hand, pressed Zhou Ze's hand on her head, and then pressed Zhou Ze's hand to rub it back and rub it back on her head.\n\n\n\n\"…………” Zhou Cheng\n\n\n\n\"You, it's great.\" Little Roo Li finally stood up from the ice cabinet, but it seemed that it was a bit difficult to climb out because of her short legs.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze carried her out of the ice cabinet.\n\n\n\nI don't know how she lies in before\n\n\n\n\"You are very good.\" Xiao Luoli pointed at Zhou Ze, \"repeat\"\n\n\n\n\"Amount... Thank you\" Zhou Ze didn't know how to recover\n\n\n\n\"I'm leaving.\" Xiao Luoli turned around, facing Zhou Ze, and crossed her hands behind her back. Zhou Ze knew that she wanted to show a kind of attitude that she admired.\n\n\n\nBut her problem is the same as Xu Qinglang.\n\n\n\nGod gave the wrong skin bag\n\n\n\nShe feels so cute no matter how she looks\n\n\n\nHold on,\n\n\n\nDon't laugh\n\n\n\nZhou Ze kept reminding himself,\n\n\n\nThis is black and white, unpredictable old man,\n\n\n\nDon't laugh\n\n\n\nHahahahahaha\n\n\n\nBut I still can't help it\n\n\n\nHe was dying hahaha\n\n\n\nFinished hahaha\n\n\n\nThe more you laughed, the more you became, the more annoying it became, and even your eyes were dripping.\n\n\n\nXiao Luli ignored Zhou Ze's laughter and did not cure Zhou Ze's crime of great disrespect.\n\n\n\nJust asked:\n\n\n\n\"You want to take over me.\"",

    "content": "\"You want... to take my place?\"\n\nThis question caught Zhou Ze completely off guard.\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nWas he about to go from an unregistered resident hiding all over the city to a local civil servant, just like that?\n\nThe surprise came too suddenly.\n\nZhou Ze didn't quite dare to accept.\n\nPies do fall from the sky, but most people who encounter such things end up being crushed to death by them.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze didn't think that saving her life warranted this kind of treatment from her.\n\nAfter all, the incident with the driver still wasn't cleared up. This little loli was very cute, but that was just her outer shell.\n\nXu Qinglang had said that she once appeared in his shop, expressionlessly stuck out her tongue, and collected the souls of his parents.\n\nNo matter how Xu Qinglang cried and begged, she remained completely unmoved.\n\nWith a person like that, you couldn't expect her to repay a kindness. You should be thanking your lucky stars if she didn't turn around and bite you.\n\nAs a Ghost Official of the Underworld,\nhow many partings and reunions had she witnessed?\nHow much of humanity's evil?\nHow much of ghosts' venomous resentment?\n\nShe wasn't a simple little girl, nor could she possibly be.\n\n\"What, not talking anymore?\" the little loli asked again.\n\n\"I don't know what to say. Are you just asking casually?\" Zhou Ze asked cautiously.\n\n\"You can say no,\" the little loli said.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nThe little loli continued, \"And then, I'll drag you down.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAlright then.\n\nIsn't that much more comfortable?\n\nWho needs a multiple-choice question?\n\nA fill-in-the-blank is just fine.\n\nThe question was basically: answer anything other than \"Y,\" and you get shot.\n\n\"I agree,\" Zhou Ze replied. This time, there was no hesitation, no more struggle.\n\nThe little loli turned around and smiled, a touch of innocent charm in her expression. Then, she walked slowly over to Zhou Ze, and, acting like a little adult, tried to straighten his collar.\n\nThis seemed to be a way for a superior to show favor to a subordinate, a bit like an ancient emperor bestowing upon a minister the opportunity to dine with him.\n\nIt was just that the little loli was too short. Standing in front of Zhou Ze, she couldn't reach his collar, so she could only adjust his belt.\n\n\"Pick me up,\" the little loli pouted, commanding him.\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked the little loli up.\n\nThe little loli reached out and straightened Zhou Ze's collar, then frowned, seeming to feel that being held by Zhou Ze like a daughter was somewhat incongruous.\n\n\"Do I look silly like this?\"\n\n\"Very cute.\"\n\nThe little loli raised her small hand, intending to slap Zhou Ze's cheek.\n\nIn that instant, the nails on the hand Zhou Ze was using to hold the loli grew swiftly long and black, and a black vortex swirled in the depths of his eyes.\n\nThe little loli stopped, a meaningful smile playing on her lips.\n\nZhou Ze didn't make any further moves either.\n\n\"Do you have any idea how foolish it is to show anger and defiance in front of me?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"Doesn't matter. I'm already someone who's died once.\"\n\n\"That's because you got lucky and only walked a short stretch of the Yellow Springs Road before you left. You've never experienced the pain and torment of the journey through Hell!\" the little loli declared loudly. \"That kind of torment makes everyone who committed suicide and went to Hell regret it immensely! 'A miserable life is better than a good death'—that is by no means just empty words of comfort.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\"Put me down.\"\n\nZhou Ze put the little loli down.\n\nThe little loli leaned back slightly, looking at Zhou Ze. \"Do you know why I chose you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Because you're very smart. Or rather, you're very calm and know your place.\" The little loli counted on her fingers. \"The Underworld has its order, the mortal world has its laws. For all sorts of reasons, there are quite a few people who smuggle themselves out, but you are the calmest one I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that's the real reason,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The real reason... I don't feel like telling you.\" The little loli stretched. \"I'm tired, I want to go down. So, I happened to run into you, and you won't cause me too much trouble, so I picked you. Heh, a while back in Chengdu there was this guy, caused a huge ruckus. He was clearly just a pitiful stowaway, yet he styled himself a judge. A ghost, delusionally trying to carry out his own sentences in the mortal world. Tell me, wasn't he stupid?\"\n\n\"Stupid,\" Zhou Ze replied. Then, he suddenly remembered that the old Taoist seemed to be from Chengdu. \"What happened to him later?\"\n\n\"He was snuffed out.\"\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, her face a picture of innocence. \"The rules are flexible, but for those who cross the line too far, there's no hope at all.\"\n\n\"He died?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I mean, was he dragged back to Hell, or was his soul scattered?\"\n\nAt his words, a trace of anger appeared on the little loli's face, as if he had struck a nerve.\n\n\"That... is something you don't need to know.\"\n\nThe little loli grabbed Zhou Ze's hand, placing her small palm against his.\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze felt his palm sear with heat. When the little loli moved her hand away, Zhou Ze saw a black runic symbol had appeared in the center of his palm.\n\nThe rune wasn't complex; it looked like an eye.\n\n\"The Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" the little loli said very seriously. \"Those who should go down, you send them down. Those who should be scattered, you can scatter them directly. Of course, if you want to play the hero and right some wrongs¹, that's fine too. But you'll bear those consequences yourself. If you screw up, you're on your own.\"\n\nThe little loli yawned, as if she were tired.\n\n\"You said you were tired. How long will you be resting? Am I... considered a substitute?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"We'll talk when I get back,\" the little loli said, preparing to go downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze continued to ask, \"So what do I do? Go out on patrol every night,\nlook for ghosts,\nand then,\ndeal with them?\"\n\n\"The door is in your hands; you figure it out. You can keep running your bookstore. You're a ghost, a ghost possessing a corpse. Those 'unclean things' and other miscellaneous riffraff will flock to you on their own. To them, you're a candle in the night, and they are the moths. Besides, after I left that mark on you, it's like you've been upgraded from a candle to an incandescent bulb, bright enough to blind their damn dog eyes.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli went downstairs, and Zhou Ze followed her.\n\n\"I'll read for a bit, then I'll be off. This body's mother will be here to pick her up soon.\"\n\nThe little loli sat down on a plastic chair and randomly picked up an illustrated book to flip through.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside her, not to wait on her, but because he had some questions to ask.\n\n\"Go on, ask,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"Is there... a salary?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"You know, this business of mine loses money.\"\n\n\"The economy's not doing so well. It's getting harder and harder to earn money from the living,\" the little loli lamented.\n\n\"It really is,\" Zhou Ze chimed in.\n\n\"Then just earn money from the dead.\"\n\n\"But you can't spend dead people's money,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"That's because you're not doing it right.\" The little loli held out her hand. \"Bring me some hell money. The kind given by the dead.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out a stack of hell money and placed half of it in the little loli's hand.\n\n\"You've earned quite a bit,\" the little loli remarked with a glance.\n\nZhou Ze didn't mention that half of it had come from the old Taoist from Chengdu. For some reason, Zhou Ze had a feeling that letting this little loli know would bring him trouble.\n\nHolding the money, the little loli pushed open the bookstore door and squatted down by the side of the road.\n\n\"Lighter.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed her a lighter.\n\nThe little loli burned the hell money, and the ashes were quickly blown away by the wind.\n\nThen, she stood up and dusted off her hands. \"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood there in the wind, feeling a bit dazed.\n\n\"Is this an advance deposit to my account at the Underworld Bank?\"\n\n\"Just wait and see. Your place still doesn't have enough human presence.\" The two of them, one big and one small, just stood at the shop entrance waiting. They waited for about half an hour.\n\nThe wind blew until the little loli's tender face was a bit red. Zhou Ze wasn't afraid of the cold, but standing on the roadside staring like a couple of idiots just felt bizarre.\n\nFinally,\na pot-bellied man walked past them. Then, a wallet fell from the man's pocket. He didn't notice at all and kept walking.\n\nZhou Ze went over and picked up the wallet. He found several thousand yuan inside, along with an ID card, bank cards, and other things.\n\n\"Should I go return it to him?\" Zhou Ze asked tentatively.\n\nThe little loli burst out laughing.\n\n\"That man did something to feel guilty about. This counts as him losing wealth to avoid disaster. This money is what you deserve.\"\n\nThe little loli pushed the door open and went back into the bookstore. She rubbed her hands together; clearly, she had gotten quite cold in that half hour. It was much warmer inside.\n\nZhou Ze walked in with the wallet, asking in disbelief, \"He won't call the police?\"\n\n\"Take the money. It won't burn your hands,\" the little loli said, growing impatient.\n\n\"Fine. So does this mean that whenever I'm short on cash, I can just stand at the door burning hell money, and someone will come deliver money to me?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but he also found it amusing.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang came over, holding a large bottle of plum juice.\n\n\"Hey, I only had enough ingredients in the shop to make this much. For the rest, you'll have to wait...\"\n\nThe moment Xu Qinglang pushed open the door and saw the little loli sitting there, he stumbled violently, and the bottle in his hand fell to the floor, shattering into pieces.\n\nPlum juice splashed all over the bookstore floor.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, gesturing for him to control himself.\n\nThe little loli seemed to pay Xu Qinglang no mind at all.\n\nIndeed, someone who was just lucky and knew a bit about the mystical arts really wasn't worth a second glance from her.\n\n\"Whose daughter is this? So cute, hahahaha! Come, little friend, Uncle has a tank of little goldfish at home, want to come home with Uncle to see them?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's smile was very awkward, forced out through sheer effort.\n\nThe little loli just spat out a single word: \"Scram.\"\n\nXu Qinglang smiled again, then turned and went back to his own shop.\n\n\"Do you think I'm being out of line?\" the little loli looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"A little,\" Zhou Ze said honestly.\n\n\"Then what if I told you that the driver's death was just because I was bored sitting on the school bus, so I revealed my true form to play a little joke?\n\nWould you think...\nthat's even more out of line?\"\n\nShe tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze with a blankly adorable expression.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ `路見不平一聲吼啊` (lù jiàn bùpíng yī shēng hǒu a): A famous line from the theme song of the classic novel *Water Margin*.

    "content": "\"Is that too much?\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't answer this question. Regardless of whether the little loli was telling the truth or not, he didn't have the standing to question her further.\n\nIt was frustrating, but it was the truth.\n\nAlthough he had heard from the little loli of Rongcheng about that \"kindred spirit,\" also from Rongcheng, who had presumptuously tried to act as a judge of the mortal world in the guise of a ghost,\n\nZhou Ze felt both envy and reverence, but that ghost's end was also lamentable.\n\nWhen you lack the capital and the strength to stand on the same level as the other party, you don't even have the right to an equal conversation. Where would the right to interrogate them come from?\n\n\"How dull.\" The little loli shook her head, but then she smiled. \"But that's precisely what I admire about you.\"\n\nThe little loli continued to hold the book in both hands, looking as if she were about to fall asleep, and murmured:\n\n\"You're the most self-aware person I've ever met.\"¹\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nWas that a compliment or an insult?\n\n\"I have to go.\" The little loli was getting sleepier and more fatigued.\n\n\"I have one more question. Eating and sleeping—are there really no other solutions or ways to improve the situation?\" This was the question Zhou Ze most wanted to ask and was most desperate to solve.\n\nHaving returned by reanimating a corpse, he could blend perfectly into society at all other times, aside from these two problems.\n\n\"In terms of stability, a custom-built computer is never as good as a pre-built one.\" The little loli shook her head weakly. \"As for sleeping, unless you have an umbral creature that crawled out of Hell by your side, one that can provide you with an environmental magnetic field similar to Hell's, you won't be able to rest at all.\n\n\"You're originally from Hell. Lingering in the mortal realm is like being unable to acclimate to a new environment—and in your case, it's the most severe version. Because you're also special in some ways, you can manage with special methods. Others can't sleep at all. Six months without sleep would drive them insane, or even kill them!\n\n\"So, you're already considered lucky.\"\n\nThe little loli gave two weak \"heh-hehs.\" \"If I weren't going back, you could always sleep while holding me.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for eating, I still can't get used to mortal food.\"\n\nAfter saying all this, the little loli's head tilted to the side, and she fell directly into a deep sleep. Zhou Ze reached out and steadied her. Seeing that she was still breathing and her body was fine, he let out a sigh of relief.\n\nZhou Ze had been a doctor before, so he could naturally tell the girl was not in any serious trouble.\n\nThis little one was Wang Ke's daughter; he couldn't just stand by and let something happen to her.\n\nBut what disappointed Zhou Ze a little was that the scene of the little loli's departure was a bit too ordinary.\n\n\"Shouldn't she have vanished into the ground with a 'biu' sound? Just falling asleep counts as going back?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nNot grand enough, and nothing to look at, just like drawing a talisman on his own palm;\n\nThere was no sense of ceremony, no B-ge at all.²\n\nThe little loli in his arms suddenly opened her eyes and said, \"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment. She was pretending to be asleep!\n\nThe next moment, a cloud of umbral energy so dense it seemed about to condense into droplets erupted from the little loli's body. Even though the central air conditioning was on in Zhou Ze's bookstore, the temperature plummeted in an instant.\n\nThe door was closed, yet gusts of cold wind whipped through the room, accompanied by the sound of book pages flipping.\n\nA vast shadow covered the area, like the awakening of a ferocious beast, bringing with it a pressure that only ghostly beings could perceive.\n\nStimulated by this, Zhou Ze's fingernails grew out again, and he felt a surge in his veins, as if the power within his body was responding to hers.\n\nThen, it really was,\n\nwith a \"biu,\"\n\nall the umbral energy instantly poured into a single point in the ground.\n\nIn a flash,\n\nthe clouds and mist dispersed,\n\nthe temperature returned to normal,\n\nand the sunlight shone through.\n\nIn a daze, it seemed to truly echo that line:\n\n\"Just like birds seeking the woods when the food is gone, leaving behind a vast, white, and truly clean expanse!\"³\n\n...\n\nIn the evening, Xu Qinglang brought dinner. There was no more sour plum juice; it had been replaced with bitter melon juice.\n\n\"The sour plum juice is gone. Make do with bitter melon juice for now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said, a little embarrassed. During the day, he had seen the little loli and been scared out of his wits.\n\nIn truth, he understood that he was a coward and quite useless.\n\nWhen the little loli had taken his parents' souls, he hadn't dared to confront her or even resist, only able to kneel there and beg like a weakling.\n\nMoreover, he had misdirected his anger onto Zhou Ze, even trying to poison his food.\n\nNow, Xu Qinglang had come to terms with it. So what if he was a coward? He was just a minor mystic who had Yin-Yang Eyes due to his physical constitution. He truly didn't have the guts to face a Hell Warden.\n\nIn fact, the little loli could have punished him for illegally detaining his parents' souls, taking away his lifespan or even directly ripping out his soul to take back to Hell.\n\nShe had treated him like a fart and let him go, so there was no need for him to keep making a fuss.\n\nThe dead cannot be resurrected, and his previous actions had indeed gone against the Way of Heaven.\n\nAfter finishing his meal, Zhou Ze took out a thousand yuan and placed it in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"For the previous meals, and for future ones. Tell me when it runs out.\"\n\n\"Oh? Struck it rich?\" A small smile finally appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. He then pushed the money back to Zhou Ze and said gently, \"Life isn't easy. Don't be a spendthrift. You have to think of your home.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I'm a man with over twenty properties. I don't care about this little bit of money.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say that he too would be rich soon. As long as he earned more dead people's money and then burned some joss paper for fun at his doorstep, some dumbass would run to his shop and drop a wallet, acting like a wealth-scattering child god.\n\nBut then Zhou Ze thought again, even if he burned a truckload of Hell money, he probably couldn't conjure up twenty-something properties, could he?\n\nUnless an armored truck had an accident at his storefront...\n\n\"I'm thinking of moving my shop. What about you?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"Anywhere is better than here.\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"I'm planning to move the noodle shop to a county town down the way. The scale might be smaller, but at least there are more people.\"\n\n\"I'll see,\" Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n\"Okay, I'm off then.\"\n\nXu Qinglang collected the bowl and chopsticks and walked out of the Spirit Shop.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, trimmed his nails while looking at the symbol on his palm. It was nighttime, and still no customers had arrived. Zhou Ze was getting a little anxious. Before, when he saw no hope, he just muddled through one day at a time. Now that he saw a glimmer of hope for making money, his own initiative had naturally kicked in.\n\nWhat, still no customers?\n\nWeren't we clear that I'm an incandescent light bulb?\n\nSupposed to be bright enough to blind their ghostly eyes?\n\nCome on,\n\nWere they all blinded and got lost?\n\n\"Creeaak...\"\n\nThe bookstore's door was pushed open, and two women walked in.\n\nOne was very young, about the same age as Zhou Ze (Xu Le), while the other was probably close to fifty. They looked like a mother and daughter.\n\nZhou Ze recognized the young woman.\n\nShe was his very first customer after opening the store. He remembered she had come in with a corgi, sat for a while to read, and even left him a hundred yuan—his first-ever income.\n\nThis time, however, the woman didn't have her corgi with her; instead, she was with her mother.\n\n\"Sigh, sit here. Be careful, check if there's anything dirty on it,\" the older woman said to the girl.\n\nThe girl bent down, took out a facial tissue, wiped the plastic stool, and then sat down dejectedly.\n\n\"Pick up a book and read, daughter. There are no unsolvable problems, no hurdles in life you can't overcome. Try to look on the bright side,\" the woman advised from the side.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The girl sighed, her expression still downcast. She clearly hadn't taken the words to heart.\n\n\"Daughter, just pick up a book. If you read, you'll forget about time.\" The woman crouched beside the girl, continuing to console her, a perfect picture of a caring parent's heart.\n\nZhou Ze was still trimming his nails, paying them no mind.\n\nJust then, the girl looked at Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"Boss.\"\n\nThe girl's voice was very soft, with a pitiable look that could stir compassion in anyone. She looked as if she'd just had her heart broken and was at her most vulnerable.\n\nOf course, in the eyes of an old hand, this was the easiest time to stick the \"needle\" in the gap.\n\n\"You must be the boss.\" The woman looked at Zhou Ze like a mother hen protecting her chick.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" the woman said warily. \"Daughter, ignore him.\"\n\nThe girl was silent for a moment but finally spoke up:\n\n\"Beibei is missing.\"\n\nBeibei must be the name of the corgi.\n\n\"Missing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, missing.\" The girl's eyes were red, and as she thought of her beloved dog, tears welled up again. \"It slipped out of the house while I was cleaning. I didn't notice.\"\n\n\"If it's lost, it's lost. We can just buy another one. What are you crying for?\" the woman consoled.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked over.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" the woman said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You'll find him,\" Zhou Ze said, ignoring the woman and comforting the girl.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nCrying, the girl reached out and hugged Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You bastard! She lost a dog, not her man! What are you getting close for!\" The woman postured as if to rush over and hit Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Do you have any right to speak here?\"\n\nA black glint appeared in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThe woman was so frightened she let out a shriek and curled up on the ground, not daring to make another peep.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" The girl looked up, bewildered. She didn't know who Zhou Ze had just been talking to.\n\nZhou Ze let the girl go. When a person's emotions are at their lowest, the three lamps on their body are at their weakest, making it easy for unclean things to latch onto them.\n\nFortunately, this woman had probably been lonely for too long and liked to chatter, but she wasn't a bad person, per se.\n\n\"I posted a missing dog notice online. I want to find him,\" the girl said, taking out her phone to show Zhou Ze a picture of the dog.\n\n\"Boss, have you seen him?\"\n\nZhou Ze gave a bitter smile. His business was so dead that people didn't even come, let alone dogs.\n\nBut the woman, who had just been scared into a heap on the floor by Zhou Ze, suddenly shouted:\n\n\"I've seen that dog! I've seen that dog! It was right in my residential complex!\n\n\"When my husband and that little vixen were... doing things, I couldn't stand being in the house anymore,\n\n\"so I went down to the complex to clear my head and saw someone walking this very dog!\"\n\n---\n¹ A literal translation of the modern slang `心裡有逼數` (xīnlǐ yǒu bī shù) is impossible. It means to have a realistic grasp of one's own situation and limitations, to \"know your place.\" \"Self-aware\" is the closest natural English equivalent.\n\n² `B格` (bī gé) is popular Chinese slang derived from the English \"big\" and Chinese `格` (gé, style/standard). It refers to a sense of style, class, or cool factor.\n\n³ A famous line from a commentary on the \"Hao Liao Ge\" (好了歌, \"The 'All's Good' Song\") in the classic Chinese novel *A Dream of the Red Chamber* (紅樓夢). It describes the sudden emptiness that follows worldly success and glory.",

    "content": "\"Where is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Xingfa Community. A man and his daughter were walking it, I remember,\" the woman said with conviction. \"I knew that man when I was alive, even argued with him! He actually tried to take advantage of me back then, tried to hit on *me*!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and warned, \"If you're lying to me or trying to pull some ghostly trick like 'killing with a borrowed knife,' I'll make sure you can't even remain a ghost.\"\n\n\"No way, big bro. I may be dead, but I'm still a good person. Go ask around my old community; everyone will tell you that Sister Hong is a warm-hearted, good person.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved a hand, signaling for her to be quiet.\n\nThe girl didn't know who Zhou Ze was talking to; of course, Zhou Ze's voice was also very low, as if he were muttering to himself.\n\n\"I think a friend told me that a family in Xingfa Community has a dog similar to this one. You can go there and ask around,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Really? Okay, I'll go right now.\"\n\nThe girl finished speaking and took out her wallet to pay.\n\n\"Forget it, no need.\"\n\n\"I should. Thank you for the information, boss.\" The girl took out five hundred yuan and insisted on stuffing it into Zhou Ze's hand.\n\n\"Let's wait until you find it,\" Zhou Ze said, still refusing the money.\n\n\"Well, thank you, boss.\"\n\nThe girl wiped away her tears and left the bookstore.\n\n\"What a good kid,\" the woman said, still sitting on the bookstore's tile floor.\n\n\"You can get lost now, too.\"\n\n\"Big bro, it's not easy for me to find someone who can hear me speak. Can't you just chat with your big sister for a little while longer?\"\n\nThe woman looked as though she had truly been holding it in for a very, very long time.\n\n\"No time.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat back down behind the counter, picked up a nail clipper, and continued trimming his nails.\n\n\"Big bro, I'm afraid a bookstore in this location doesn't get much business, does it?\" the woman said, still trying to make conversation.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to suddenly remember something and asked, \"Want to go down?\"\n\n\"Down?\" The woman paused, apparently not understanding.\n\n\"To the place you're supposed to be right now.\" Zhou Ze had just remembered that he was apparently still a part-time ghost reaper.\n\n\"Can I not go down?\" the woman asked, looking troubled. \"My son is taking the *gaokao*¹ this year. I want to stay with him until he's finished before I go.\"\n\nSuch is a parent's heart.\n\n\"If your son knew his dead mother was still keeping him company while he studies at night, he'd surely be moved to tears,\" Zhou Ze teased.\n\nGetting moved to tears was probably unlikely, but getting scared sick and bombing the *gaokao* was a very real possibility.\n\n\"I'll just watch from the side,\" the woman said, sounding a bit wronged.\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" Zhou Ze waved a hand, not bothering to say more. When the little loli had assigned him the job, she had said that unless he deliberately overstepped his bounds to act as some sort of judge, he could otherwise act according to his mood.\n\nBesides, the little loli hadn't given him any performance reports or quotas for how many ghosts he had to collect per month or quarter.\n\n\"Big bro, how did you turn into a human?\" the woman asked curiously.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThe woman's body trembled several times in a row, and she immediately dared not speak again.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the woman muttered to herself that her son should be getting out of his evening study session and then left the bookstore.\n\nAfter she left, Zhou Ze deliberately walked over and flipped the stool she had just been sitting on. He didn't see a single piece of spirit money.\n\n\"A frugal woman, right to the end.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed, wondering if he was too good-natured.\n\nHe was, at the very least, a temporary ghost reaper, someone within the system. How dare you show up empty-handed and leave empty-handed?\n\nYou really don't treat a temp worker like he's management?\n\nPushing open the door, Zhou Ze stepped out of the bookstore, took out a cigarette, and lit it. Next door, Xu Qinglang seemed to have just finished cleaning up. He walked out wearing an apron, glanced at Zhou Ze, then squatted down beside him and bummed a cigarette.\n\nThe two men squatted in a row.\n\nBehind them was a nearly dead commercial center; in front of them, an empty road.\n\n\"That little girl was picked up by her mom?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"She went down,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, went down.\" Xu Qinglang exhaled. \"Once you go down, it's hard to come back, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zhou Ze said, shaking his head.\n\nJust as the little loli had said, when he went to Hell, he had only taken a short walk on the Road to the Underworld before coming out. He had never experienced the true horrors of Hell.\n\n\"What is Hell really like?\" Xu Qinglang asked, blowing a smoke ring.\n\n\"I don't know much about it.\"\n\nThere was nothing more to talk about, but going back into their respective shops felt even more boring. After finishing their first cigarettes, the two men naturally lit a second.\n\n\"What about that wife of yours?\" Xu Qinglang brought up the one topic he shouldn't have.\n\n\"We're separated,\" Zhou Ze said with a purse of his lips.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThen, silence again.\n\nNext, a third cigarette.\n\n\"I have to go back to my hometown for a bit soon. I'll make a new batch of plum juice for you tomorrow and leave some.\"\n\n\"Thanks. You're not from around here?\"\n\n\"I'm from Menghai.\"\n\nMenghai was a county district under the administration of Tongcheng.\n\n\"A relative of mine is getting married. To be honest, I don't want to go, but I have to. After all, we're friends who made mud pies together as kids and shamelessly followed wedding processions to ask for red envelopes.\"\n\n\"Is he asking you to be a bridesmaid?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, a bridesmaid...\" Xu Qinglang caught on and immediately shot Zhou Ze a glare. \"A groomsman.\"\n\n\"Were you married in your previous life?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"Nope,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"That's great, then. It's like you got a free wife in this life.\"\n\n\"She's not with...\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, not continuing.\n\n*The lingering attachment,*\n\n*Xu Le's lingering attachment,*\n\n*is still here!*\n\n*Yes, that must be it.*\n\n\"Since you're alive, you should live well. My parents are gone, completely gone. I've come to terms with it. I have to grow up, have to find my own life. Maybe I'll even find a girlfriend after a while.\"\n\n\"A boyfriend is more likely,\" Zhou Ze said, blowing a smoke ring, landing a finishing blow.\n\n\"Heh heh, I started planning my future wedding in my head when I was very young. What style, what kind, what scale...\"\n\n\"Isn't that something girls think about?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Can't a man have aspirations? Shut up, or you won't get any juice tomorrow!\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. *Fine, I'll shut up.*\n\n\"I plan to have a traditional-style wedding, a really vintage one. I don't want any luxury cars; I want an eight-bearer sedan chair, like in the movies. Then I'll rent a horse and wear a *magua*² or a *hanfu*³. That kind of atmosphere, you know?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed forward.\n\n\"Is it like that?\"\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment, then squinted his eyes. \"What thing?\"\n\n\"You can't see it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression hardened. He hurried back into his law office and quickly returned, rubbing something shiny onto his eyes. Then, he let out a gasp.\n\nIndeed, on the empty street ahead, a red, eight-bearer sedan chair was advancing toward them.\n\nThe bearers had red sashes tied around their waists and red ceremonial caps on their heads. The eight of them moved in perfect unison.\n\nTheir gait was nine shallow steps and one deep one, and as a result, the sedan chair would jolt every so often, and the bearers and the two men playing *suonas*⁴ in front would all hop in unison.\n\nIt looked very festive.\n\nBut for such a scene to suddenly appear in this deserted area was enough to scare the life out of any passerby.\n\nEven Xu Qinglang stood with his mouth agape, momentarily at a loss.\n\n\"Your wife?\" Zhou Ze said, pointing at the approaching wedding procession.\n\n\"Bullshit.\" Xu Qinglang took several steps back, almost retreating into his office. Seeing Zhou Ze still squatting there, he yelled, \"Aren't you going back inside? That's a ghostly wedding procession!\"\n\n\"Will they toss an embroidered ball?\" Zhou Ze patted his pants and slowly stood up.\n\n\"If you get caught, you'll be made her husband-consort,\" Xu Qinglang snorted. \"Do you want to be a bookstore owner, or do you want to be snatched away to be some ghost-woman's husband?\"\n\n\"Is it that serious?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. The ghosts he had seen before didn't have this kind of power—or more accurately, this kind of influence.\n\nIf the master in the sedan chair could really snatch a person's soul to go back with her and \"get married,\" should he intervene or not?\n\nHe could turn a blind eye to the woman from before; she would probably lose her lingering attachment and dissipate to report to Hell after her son's exams. But this one in front of him, with such a grand procession, was definitely not a simple character.\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Xu Qinglang stood inside his office, looked up at the talisman paper stuck above his door, and still felt uneasy. But seeing Zhou Ze remain unmoved, he grew even more exasperated and cursed, \"You're just a rookie ghost! They're seasoned spirits! If you back off, she might not bother you.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. He vaguely felt the seal on his palm grow a little hot, as if reminding him that the entity before him needed to be sent down below, or it would affect the mortal realm.\n\nWhen he let the woman go before, the seal had no reaction, which was tacit approval. But this time, the seal was warning him.\n\n*Being a temp worker...*\n\n*is not easy.*\n\n*Usually, when something goes wrong or there's a work oversight, the temp worker is the one who takes the fall.*\n\nZhou Ze was now in this very awkward position.\n\nThe wedding procession stopped about ten meters away from Zhou Ze.\n\nTwo bearers reached out and lifted the sedan curtain.\n\nIt was empty inside.\n\nThe *suona* player walked toward Zhou Ze and bowed deeply about a meter away.\n\n\"Our mistress has heard of the Upper Emissary's recent promotion and has ordered us to invite the Upper Emissary to her estate for a celebration.\"\n\nThis *suona* player had a handsome, delicate face, but his complexion was very pale, and his blush and lipstick were a bit excessive, just like the paper effigies sold in joss paper shops.\n\n\"You became a ghost reaper?\" Xu Qinglang walked out of his office, a sense of disbelief on his face, as if his dirt-poor next-door neighbor had suddenly become the town mayor.\n\n\"If you get rich, don't forget your friends! And you were hiding it from me!\" Xu Qinglang walked over and complained to Zhou Ze. His dramatic flair was so sharp it could make a poplar tree bend.\n\n\"This lowly one has a matter to inquire of the Upper Emissary,\" the *suona* player asked, bowing respectfully.\n\n\"Speak! What is it? No problem, leave it to him! From now on, this whole area is under his jurisdiction!\" Xu Qinglang said, taking charge with a smug, shamelessly flamboyant air.\n\n\"While ordering us to receive the Upper Emissary, our mistress also wanted us to capture a man to return with us for marriage. It is said that this man has over twenty properties in the mortal realm, making him a perfect match for our mistress. May I ask the Upper Emissary if he knows where this person is?\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  ***Gaokao***: The National College Entrance Examination in China, a notoriously difficult and high-stakes series of exams that determines university admission.\n2.  ***Magua***: A traditional Chinese jacket style worn by males during the Qing Dynasty.\n3.  ***Hanfu***: The historical styles of clothing worn by the Han people in China.\n4.  ***Suona***: A traditional Chinese double-reeded horn, known for its loud and piercing sound, often used in festivals and weddings.",

    "content": "Public morals are degenerating with each passing day, and people are not as virtuous as they once were!\n\nMany people lament this modern era, where the entire society has been scoured clean by the tides of materialism, to the point that even marriage is placed on a scale to be bought and sold for an equivalent price.\n\nHowever, in this day and age, it turns out that even ghosts are starting to get particular about this stuff when they marry!\n\nYou have over twenty houses for the living,\n\nOh, what a coincidence,\n\nMy mistress has over twenty houses for the dead,\n\nA perfect match!\n\nA joyous occasion,\n\nA truly joyous occasion for all!\n\nAfter the old man with the suona asked this question, the corner of Zhou Ze’s mouth twitched subconsciously.\n\nHe was holding back a laugh, and at the same time, deep down, he was feeling truly smug.\n\nThis neighbor of his, who couldn't go a sentence without mentioning \"I have twenty-some houses,\" was someone Zhou Ze had long wanted to smack. This Ghost Madam had truly come at the perfect time.\n\nWhat goes around, comes around!\n\nXu Qinglang was so scared he broke out in a sweat. He was a mystic, but all he could really do was open his Yin-Yang Eyes, play with some puppets, and incorporate a few tricks from \"Sichuan opera face-changing.\" He wasn't a powerhouse in the true sense, like a Celestial Master Zhang; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so cowardly when facing the little loli.\n\nInstantly snapping to his senses, Xu Qinglang began to raise his head,\n\nand gaze at the sky.\n\n*What did you say?*\n\n*I don't understand.*\n\n*That person,*\n\n*I don't know him.*\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang’s eyelid suddenly twitched, because he saw that Zhou Ze's right hand, which had been at his side, now had its index finger raised and pointing directly at him.\n\n“@#￥%……*&amp;*!!!!!!”\n\nA torrent of ten thousand bottles of sour plum juice rushed through Xu Qinglang's mind!¹\n\nThe two suona players walked right up to either side of Xu Qinglang and said respectfully,\n\n\"We invite the young master to enter the sedan.\"\n\nWell, would you look at that. Turns out this sedan wasn't here to pick up a ghost emissary after all; it was brought by that Ghost Madam specifically to welcome her new groom.\n\nZhou Ze once again redefined his identity as a \"temp\" in his mind.\n\n\"Don't pull me, don't drag me, don't force me!\n\n\"Watch out, or I'll get nasty!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was being pushed toward the sedan by the suona players, but he was still struggling relentlessly.\n\nHe had just said he wanted to start a new life, find a partner and all that, but he hadn't planned on doing it with a ghost!\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you set me up! You've ruined me!\" Xu Qinglang yelled, giving off the distinct impression of a virtuous woman being forced into prostitution.\n\n*Would rather die than submit,*\n\n*Chastity forever!*\n\n\"Just go and see. Maybe the Ghost Madam looks like Joey Wong.² You won't be getting the short end of the stick, right?\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\nXu Qinglang was shoved into the sedan. The suona player said to Zhou Ze, \"Your Excellency the Emissary may follow us. We will lead the way.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the suona player pointed at the electric scooter parked at Xu Qinglang's door.\n\n\"Your Excellency may ride.\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered his last ride in that ghost driver's paper car, which had still delivered him safely to the bookstore's entrance. So, it was clear that some ghostly beings did possess abilities akin to Qimen Dunjia,³ and the laws of physics likely didn't apply to them.\n\nThe electric scooter belonged to Xu Qinglang. Zhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony. After locking up the shop, he hopped on the scooter and followed the sedan.\n\nThe sedan bearers moved with great speed.\n\nTheir steps still followed the rhythm of nine shallow, one deep.\n\nOn every \"deep\" step, the eight sedan bearers and the two suona players would all hop in unison, causing the bridal sedan to jolt along with them.\n\nImmediately following,\n\nXu Qinglang, seated in the bridal sedan, would let out a cry of \"Ah!\"\n\nIt was like the gentle chirp of an oriole, melodious and alluring, sparking the imagination.\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze had ridden his electric scooter up alongside the bridal sedan, Xu Qinglang lifted the curtain. From the outside, Xu Qinglang's face was now flushed, and his eyes seemed to shimmer with a well-moistened, amorous gaze.\n\nHis pearly teeth bit down on his red lips, a picture of bashful, handsome charm.\n\nJust then, it was time for the sedan bearers' \"deep\" step. The sedan suddenly lifted.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nXu Qinglang cried out again subconsciously. A look of vexation appeared on his face as he stared daggers at Zhou Ze, truly overcome with shame!\n\nZhou Ze held the scooter's handlebar with one hand and gave a little wave with the other, saying with disdain,\n\n\"For shame.\"\n\n\"This sedan affects the soul! It stimulates the soul!\" Xu Qinglang had to explain. He was genuinely worried Zhou Ze would think he was lost in the pleasure of it all, unable to pull himself away.\n\n\"Excuses are just a cover-up,\" said Zhou Ze. \"Your mouth says no, but your body says yes.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang fell silent.\n\nCasting one last hateful glance at Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang dropped the curtain.\n\nThat one glance was like looking at a faithless lover who would sacrifice his partner for fame and fortune!\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze could see that the sedan bearers and suona players were moving according to a special rhythm. They were mere puppets, most likely paper effigies from a joss paper shop, somewhat similar to the wooden oxen and gliding horses designed by Zhuge Liang during the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nThe sedan bearers continued their \"nine shallow, one deep.\"\n\nXu Qinglang would let out an \"Ah!\" every so often.\n\nZhou Ze followed along on his little electric donkey.\n\nBefore he knew it, the procession had already passed through the city center and entered the Tongzhou District.\n\nA few years ago, Tongzhou District was still a county under Tongcheng's jurisdiction, having only recently been redesignated. Zhou Ze had been here once before when he helped the old woman from the morgue find her money.\n\nFinally, the sedan procession entered a patch of wasteland just off Jianghai Avenue. The area was surrounded by tall buildings, but this particular spot had likely been left undeveloped for some special reason.\n\nThe path inside wasn't suitable for riding anymore, so Zhou Ze had to get off and push the scooter forward.\n\nAfter another few dozen meters,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nthe view opened up!\n\nThe originally dark and desolate wasteland was now hung with lanterns and colored streamers. Ahead, more than twenty open-air banquet tables were set up, each with ten cold dishes arranged neatly upon it.\n\nThere was a bustling crowd, a mountain of rouge and powder, and the sound of tinkling laughter.\n\nA mischief-maker raised their voice and shouted, \"The groom has arrived!\"\n\nIn an instant, a swarm of painted faces and fine dresses descended. Zhou Ze felt himself surrounded by a flurry of chattering women, a truly lively scene. Some of them passed directly through his body and scooter, flitting back and forth tirelessly.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze's right hand was clenched tight, the mark still burning.\n\nIn fact, even without the mark's reminder, Zhou Ze knew clearly that this place was likely a problem that a ghost emissary needed to solve.\n\nBecause the ghosts here, under the call of that Ghost Madam, had already become organized and established. That, of course, could not be tolerated!\n\nBut Zhou Ze kept holding back. For one, he had just started this temp job and wasn't eager to make a bold show of power right away, lest he burn himself out. After all, whenever something went wrong in any department in the mortal world, it was always the temp who ended up as the scapegoat. Zhou Ze figured the Underworld was probably the same, since people from the mortal world were the ones who went there after they died.\n\nFurthermore, Zhou Ze was also aware that if this was an easy problem to handle, why hadn't the little loli solved it herself?\n\nThe fact that the other party dared to come to his door and invite him, a ghost emissary, to attend the celebration was proof enough of their brazen confidence.\n\n\"Lower the sedan!\"\n\nThe sedan bearers lowered the carriage in unison. Xu Qinglang was pushed out, looking reserved, bashful, and utterly overwhelmed with shame and indignation.\n\n\"The Mistress invites you.\"\n\nA woman in a black, ancient-style dress walked up to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang and curtsied.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nZhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\nXu Qinglang disdainfully slapped Zhou Ze's hand away but still followed him forward.\n\nAs they walked past the banquet tables, listening to the various ghosts point and whisper at them, Zhou Ze felt genuinely ill at ease. Fortunately, by the time they reached a small, two-story red house, the cacophony of surrounding voices finally faded away.\n\nThe building was decorated with lanterns and streamers, hung with large red lanterns, and even had new Spring Festival couplets, giving it a festive and celebratory air.\n\nThe layout was similar to a modern house. The main door in the center opened into a living room. The maid in the black dress gestured for Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang to enter.\n\n\"Excited?\" Zhou Ze asked suddenly. \"If she really has the same aura as Joey Wong, don't you go getting so happy you forget to come back.\"\n\n\"I'm hoping she's into 'one dragon playing with two phoenixes'.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said viciously, making it clear that if he was going down, he was dragging Zhou Ze down with him.\n\nIt was just that Zhou Ze had been so relentless in kicking him while he was down this entire trip, as if he was hell-bent on seeing him make a fool of himself!\n\nSo what if he liked to mention that \"I have over twenty houses\"?\n\nWasn't it the truth?!\n\nHad he been deliberately showing off or anything?\n\nStepping into the main hall, their feet trod upon a bright red carpet. The four walls were adorned with exquisite cross-stitch tapestries.\n\nA woman in a red wedding gown sat with graceful composure at a small table.\n\nOn the table were exquisite dishes and fine wine.\n\n\"Your Excellency the Emissary, my husband, please be seated.\"\n\nThe woman rose and gestured for the two to sit.\n\nBecause the woman's face was covered by a wedding veil, it couldn't be seen clearly.\n\nBut her voice was truly beautiful.\n\nZhou Ze took a seat. He gave Xu Qinglang a tug, and only then did Xu Qinglang reluctantly sit down.\n\n*Might as well play along now that we're here. Let's see what tricks she has up her sleeve.*\n\nThe dishes on the small table were exquisite and fragrant, the wine rich and mellow, its aroma intoxicating to the senses.\n\n\"Your Excellency the Emissary, my husband, please, help yourselves.\" The Ghost Madam gestured with her hand for them to eat.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move, maintaining his reserve.\n\nThe grief-stricken Xu Qinglang, however, downed three cups of wine in misery, then exclaimed, \"Good wine!\"\n\nFollowing that, he began to eat nonstop, completely channeling his grief into appetite.\n\nWatching from the side, Zhou Ze's chest heaved, and he covered his mouth with his hand.\n\n\"What's wrong with you? Eat! It's delicious, better than my own cooking.\" Xu Qinglang himself was a chef, so he could naturally tell good food from bad.\n\n*Have you never seen a ghost movie?*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nBut he still said nothing. Instead, he picked up his chopsticks, placed some food in Xu Qinglang's bowl, and urged,\n\n\"Be good, eat up. There's no sour plum juice here, so I can't eat anything, you know.\"\n\nXu Qinglang snorted twice. Not suspecting a thing, he continued to eat. If he was going to die, he would die on a full stomach!\n\nAnd besides, it was really delicious!\n\nXu Qinglang was even thinking about whether he should find a chance later to ask the Ghost Madam for the recipes. If these dishes were sold on the market, not even the top chefs at five-star hotels could produce such a flavor.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang had eaten his fill,\n\nZhou Ze nodded in satisfaction.\n\nHe asked the Ghost Madam, \"Madam, may I ask how these dishes were prepared?\"\n\n\"Your Excellency is too kind. This wine,\" she said, \"was brewed by this humble servant from the urine of passersby.\n\n\"And these dishes were made by this humble servant using the freshest snakes, insects, rats, and ants, all meticulously prepared...\"\n\nXu Qinglang's face changed drastically.\n\nHe pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, but before he could say anything,\n\nhe just went:\n\n\"Bleeeaaargh...\"\n\n---\n¹ A metaphor for an overwhelming feeling of bitterness and regret.\n² An actress famous for her role as a beautiful ghost in the 1987 film *A Chinese Ghost Story*.\n³ An ancient form of Chinese divination, often depicted in fiction as a mystical art for manipulating space and reality.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang was vomiting his guts out, so much that he almost threw up his bile.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head slightly. *This kid is still too young. He probably didn't watch enough horror movies as a child. This whole 'encountering a ghost in the wild and eating with it' thing is one of the most classic scenes there is.*\n\nThe delicacies on the plates were, in fact, maggots, earthworms, cockroaches, ants, and the like.\n\nThis trope had been done to death.\n\nEven if he didn't have an eating disorder, Zhou Ze wouldn't have touched a single bite.\n\nDid you really expect the ghosts here to go grocery shopping every day? To set up a stove and cook for you?\n\nZhou Ze remembered a case from the past. A man went to visit a friend. The friend said his wife was away on a trip, so he would have to entertain him alone. The man stayed at his friend's house for a week. The only drawback was that his friend's home had too few vegetable dishes; it was all meat. But the meat soup was truly delicious.\n\nAfter he said goodbye to his friend and left, he ran into a neighbor. The neighbor said that the friend hadn't left his house in nearly a month, locking himself inside all day.\n\nUpon hearing this, the man immediately threw up.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up the wine cup in front of him, then put it back down.\n\nHe’d almost forgotten.\n\nIt was passerby urine.\n\n\"If my husband is unwell, he may go and rest first,\" the Ghost Madam said, looking at the black-gowned maidservant beside her.\n\nThe maidservant nodded and walked over, preparing to help Xu Qinglang up.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed her supporting arm away, sat up straight, and said:\n\n\"Just get to the point. I don't want to play any more of these games.\"\n\nWell, Xu Qinglang was angry.\n\nThoroughly angry.\n\nThe Ghost Madam stood up and walked before Zhou Ze. He could clearly smell the delicate fragrance emanating from her. Her graceful figure and voluptuous curves couldn't help but spark one's imagination.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief inwardly.\n\n*I've been spending a lot of time with Xu Qinglang, but I'm still normal.*\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't have the courage to lift the Ghost Madam's red wedding veil.\n\nFrom rosy beauty to withered bones—it was only natural.\n\nJudging by the decor and layout of this place, it was clear this Ghost Madam had been dead for a very long time. Lift her veil, and if she's in a good mood, she might let you see her face from when she was alive.\n\nIf you're unlucky, she'll just use a skeletal face crawling with maggots to blind your damn eyes.\n\nZhou Ze remembered reading a report in his past life, back when it was trendy for husbands to accompany their wives into the delivery room.\n\nMany idealistic people thought this would help husbands understand their wives' sacrifice and greatness. Later, a Japanese husband who accompanied his wife for the birth became directly depressed, developing a psychological trauma. He could no longer live a normal marital life and ultimately had to get a divorce.\n\nAnd right now, Zhou Ze was well aware that he had a neighbor prettier than any woman constantly by his side. If he got spooked by this Ghost Madam's face, his own orientation might truly spiral into an unfathomable abyss.\n\nIn both his past and present lives, he had never seemed to get what he truly wanted from women. Zhou Ze had no desire to skip several steps and start playing some avant-garde game in this life.\n\n\"High Official, the reason I asked you to come here rather than visiting you myself was not out of disrespect or an intentional slight. It is truly because I have no other way to leave this place.\"\n\nThe Ghost Madam pleaded tearfully with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for this gentleman, the only reason he was invited was because of a jest he made more than a decade ago when he passed by here as a child. He told his companion at the time that if female ghosts were truly as beautiful as Joey Wang in the movies, he would be willing to marry one.\"\n\nHearing this, Xu Qinglang's mouth fell open.\n\nHe'd forgotten all about that. Had that really happened?\n\nZhou Ze, however, glanced at Xu Qinglang with a look that said: *Who would've thought? You look so effeminate, but you were such an early bloomer.*\n\n\"What, specifically, is the matter?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't just come out and say, *You've been a very naughty ghost, and I'm taking you back to Hell.*\n\nThe little loli had once said he was the most self-aware person¹ she had ever met.\n\nIndeed,\n\nZhou Ze was very aware of the situation right now. With no benefits, no performance metrics, and no assigned mission, he really had no need to sacrifice himself for the prosperity of Hell.\n\n\"Worry not, High Official. I am preparing to depart today, my soul returning to the Netherworld.\" The Ghost Madam smiled and continued, \"My surname is Bai. I was the daughter of a scholarly family during the Daoguang era. Alas, my fate was cruel. I died suddenly on the eve of my wedding and was buried here. It has been nearly two hundred years.\n\n\"Although I am a ghost, I have never committed any sinister deeds. I once protected the local villagers, ensuring they lived and worked in peace. Mr. Se'an even inscribed a plaque for my shrine, and from that time, I had a temple of my own and could receive incense offerings.\n\n\"However, in the last sixty years, the shrine has fallen into ruin and can no longer be found. Nowadays, no one even knows that such an unsanctioned shrine² ever existed here.\"\n\n\"Who is Mr. Se'an?\" Xu Qinglang asked, blinking.\n\n\"Zhang Jian,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Oh, him.\" Now Xu Qinglang understood.\n\nZhang Jian was a famous figure from Tongcheng in the late Qing Dynasty. He drafted the abdication edict for the Qing Emperor and was a top scholar as well as a nationalist entrepreneur.\n\nThe \"unsanctioned shrine\" the Ghost Madam mentioned wasn't a disreputable place, but rather a temple for a deity not officially recognized by the imperial court's rites, a place of unsanctioned worship.\n\n\"Then you're quite formidable,\" Xu Qinglang said, having recovered from his earlier vomiting spell. After the Ghost Madam explained that he was only invited because of a childhood joke, he relaxed. As long as they weren't forcing him to be her husband, it was fine.\n\n*Cultivating for two hundred years, and even having a shrine built to receive incense offerings... she must have moved beyond the level of a mere ghost, right?*\n\n\"Now, my cultivation is complete, and I am about to descend to the Netherworld. However, there is one matter I cannot ignore.\"\n\nThe Ghost Madam curtsied slightly to Zhou Ze and implored:\n\n\"My former physical body, due to the circumstances of my burial, has remained uncorrupted for two hundred years, as if alive. My soul is now about to enter the Netherworld, but I cannot take my physical body with me.\n\n\"Moreover, over these two hundred years, my body, influenced by my soul, has already begun showing signs of becoming a malevolent entity. I do not wish that after my soul departs, I leave behind a body that, should some unforeseen event occur, might awaken and commit heinous acts. Therefore, I implore the High Official for assistance.\"\n\n\"How... am I to help you?\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his hands together. Since this Ghost Madam planned to go to Hell on her own, that was for the best. This was like turning herself in.\n\nNo, it wasn't quite like turning herself in. It was more like an ancient rebel army growing powerful enough to accept an amnesty from the imperial court, thereby getting their status whitewashed and receiving an official post.\n\nBut no matter what, as long as it wasn't a head-on confrontation with him, it was fine.\n\n\"I ask that the High Official help watch over my physical body until the night of the next Winter Clothes Festival, and then cremate it with bamboo and wood,\" the Ghost Madam said.\n\n\"Help watch over it?\" Zhou Ze thought for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"Does this mean the High Official agrees?\" the Ghost Madam confirmed. \"I thank you, High Official.\"\n\n\"You're too kind.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up his wine cup again.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnd put it down again.\n\n\"Then I shall take my leave.\" The Ghost Madam's figure began to slowly fade away, her departure swift and decisive.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. The next moment, he found that the entire scene around them had vanished. He and Xu Qinglang were sitting on two stone stumps.\n\nThe surrounding banquet had also disappeared without a trace. As far as the eye could see, there were only jagged rocks and overgrown weeds.\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette, looking somewhat melancholic.\n\n\"Disappointed you didn't get to see what your wife looks like?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Why didn't you lift the veil and see for yourself?\" Xu Qinglang snorted.\n\nDistance tests a horse's strength; time reveals a person's heart. Tonight, Zhou Ze had kicked him while he was down countless times, and Xu Qinglang had noted every single instance in his little mental ledger.\n\n\"She's your wife. How could I be so presumptuous?\" Zhou Ze scanned the surroundings, then stomped his shoe on the ground. \"Is Madam Bai's corpse right under this spot?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Xu Qinglang said, also a bit unsure. But soon, his eyes spotted two rusty iron shovels lying in the grass ahead. \"I guess so. They even prepared the shovels for us.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over. He and Xu Qinglang each took a shovel. Nothing else to be said. Time to dig!\n\nThe two of them dug until dawn, drenched in sweat. They finally hit something hard below. Brushing away the dirt on top, they could make out a redwood coffin.\n\nIt took another half an hour for the two of them to completely unearth it.\n\n\"Let's open it,\" Zhou Ze said. \"It's almost morning. Let's finish this quick. Otherwise, if someone sees us and calls the police, they'll think we're grave robbers.\"\n\n\"You do it,\" Xu Qinglang said, wiping away his sweat. \"I'm grossed out.\"\n\n\"Didn't she say her body hadn't decomposed?\"\n\n\"Who knows if that's true?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. No choice. This was something he had promised her. Xu Qinglang was just helping out as a friend. If he wasn't willing to do it, Zhou Ze had to do it himself.\n\nPrying open the coffin nails, Zhou Ze stood at the edge and gave a hard pull. The coffin lid was thrown open. Then, Zhou Ze took out his phone, turned on the flashlight, and shone it down.\n\n\"Heh... She's actually quite beautiful.\"\n\nXu Qinglang leaned over for a look. Indeed, the woman lying in the coffin wore a white dress, her long hair draped over her shoulders. Her face was dignified and beautiful, and her body showed no signs of decay whatsoever. She looked as if she were merely asleep.\n\n\"She's your wife. Don't you want to, while she's still warm...\"\n\nXu Qinglang suddenly shoved Zhou Ze. \"What nonsense are you spouting? Hurry up and carry her out so we can take her back.\"\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang was very proactive. He jumped down and lifted the female corpse.\n\nBut the moment he lifted her off the coffin floor, his expression changed instantly. He immediately put the corpse back down and then stood to the side, rubbing his hands nonstop.\n\n\"Hiss... So cold. A bone-chilling cold. The malevolent aura on this corpse is so strong, it's clearly on the verge of becoming a zombie. That Madam Bai definitely wasn't telling the whole truth.\n\n\"Out of a woman's vanity, she must have spent the last two hundred years intentionally nourishing her own corpse.\n\n\"Now that her cultivation is complete and she's ready to leave, she's left behind this huge problem.\"\n\nZhou Ze went down himself. When he lifted the female corpse, he too instantly perceived the chill that seemed to penetrate to his very soul.\n\nBut in the next moment, Zhou Ze felt his fingernails begin to grow longer. The chill—the malevolent aura Xu Qinglang had mentioned—began to actively pour into Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nan ecstatic, tingling sensation made Zhou Ze's very soul tremble. It felt like a kind of nourishment.\n\n\"Hah... ooh... hiss... mmmph...\"\n\nStill examining his own palms to see if he had frostbite, Xu Qinglang heard Zhou Ze's noises, and his face instantly filled with shock. He pointed at Zhou Ze and exclaimed:\n\n\"You beast!\n\n\"You're actually doing it while she's warm!\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Self-aware person:** The original Chinese is `心裡有逼數的人` (xīnlǐ yǒu bī shù de rén), a modern, vulgar slang phrase.

    "content": "Before the sky began to brighten, Zhou Ze used his electric scooter to carry the female corpse back to the bookshop. As for Xu Qinglang, he was left waiting there to hail a cab back.\n\nAfter all, he had arrived in a sedan chair; there was no sedan chair for the return trip.\n\nAfter returning to the bookstore, Zhou Ze placed the female corpse in the freezer on the second floor. He then went downstairs, took a shower, and by the time he came out in a fresh set of clothes, Xu Qinglang, who had finally managed to catch a cab, had just returned. He walked straight into the bookstore, looked at Zhou Ze's soaking wet hair, and teased:\n\n\"You need to control yourself.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze only offered these two words in reply.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head and left the bookstore without another word. He was tired too, after the night's events.\n\nZhou Ze locked the shop's door and went up to the second floor. Standing by the freezer, he looked at the female corpse inside.\n\nThe corpse's face was delicate and her aura was striking. In ancient times, people married quite young—it was common for girls to become mothers at fifteen or sixteen. Because of this, the body of Lady Bai, who had died before her wedding, looked to be about the age of an ordinary high school student, yet she possessed a natural, enchanting allure.\n\nXu Qinglang's beauty was a seductive charm, like a peony in full bloom, whereas this Lady Bai before him was the reserved grace of a daisy.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wasn't about to have inappropriate thoughts about a corpse. What he was pondering was on another level entirely.\n\nWhile holding the corpse on the electric scooter ride back, his ten fingernails had been in constant contact with her. It felt as if currents of electricity were surging into his body, continuously stimulating his soul and his nails.\n\nFortunately, Xu Qinglang wasn't with him on the way back. Otherwise, Zhou Ze probably would have ended up crying out, just as Xu Qinglang had in the sedan chair on the way there. This sort of thing was best not known by outsiders.\n\nBy the time he carried her back into the bookstore, Zhou Ze noticed that the cold aura from her body seemed to have dissipated by more than half.\n\nShe was like a rechargeable battery that he had just drained of its power. But it probably wasn't a major issue; lying there, she should be able to naturally recharge on her own.\n\nHe held his palms in front of him and his nails slowly extended. On the surface of the once translucent black nails, a blood-red streak had actually appeared. This must be the change from his nails absorbing the corpse's baleful aura.\n\nIt actually looked quite nice.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, reaching for the glass of warm water he had just brought up, only to find the water had already gone cold.\n\nBecause of the female corpse, the temperature of the entire little second floor was lower than outside, and Zhou Ze himself had a somewhat weak perception of \"cold.\"\n\nIt was a shame it wasn't summer. If it were, with the female corpse here, his shop could even save on air conditioning bills, and she'd probably work as an insect repellent too.\n\nThat night, Zhou Ze made a pallet on the floor next to the freezer and slept soundly.\n\nThe little loli had once said that if he held her, Zhou Ze could fall asleep without needing the freezer. It seemed the female corpse had a similar effect.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze stretched lazily and placed his fingernails on her lower abdomen. Instantly, the ice-cold sensation washed over him again.\n\nVery comfortable,\n\nVery enjoyable,\n\nBut the feeling only lasted for about half a minute before dissipating, which meant this was how much the female corpse had managed to recharge overnight.\n\nLady Bai had worried that her body might reanimate, and Xu Qinglang had also said that with such a dense baleful aura, the corpse could easily turn into a *jiangshi* if externally stimulated. But now, it seemed the probability was low. However much baleful aura she gathered, he would absorb that much each day.\n\nAlthough he didn't know what use this was to him, the pleasant feeling alone was enough to make Zhou Ze never tire of it.\n\nAfter going next door to Xu Qinglang's shop for a meal, Zhou Ze sat leisurely in his own store. Before he could even decide which book to read, his phone rang.\n\nIt was his sister-in-law's call.\n\n\"Xu Le, get back here.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze didn't believe this sister-in-law would suddenly call to check on him. The girl was still in her rebellious phase—a bit self-centered, or rather, actually quite selfish and unreasonable.\n\n\"Your uncle is at my house. Come and get him,\" his sister-in-law said impatiently.\n\n\"Uncle?\" Zhou Ze frowned slightly. He remembered that Xu Le, like himself, was an orphan. Of course, Xu Le hadn't grown up in an orphanage; his parents had passed away one after the other shortly after he was born.\n\n\"Alright, I'm on my way.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang next door to keep an eye on his shop for him, then hailed a cab to head back to the Lin family's home.\n\nWang Ke's treatment advice had been to temporarily cut ties with his original social network, but that was then, and this was now. Before, Zhou Ze was an undocumented person, something of a rat scurrying across the street. Now, he was a temporary civil servant¹, so there were far fewer things and dangers to worry about.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze had previously read the private diary Xu Le kept on his Qzone², which mentioned his uncle. All along, it had been his uncle who supported him through his schooling.\n\nHaving taken over the man's body, there were some things he ought to take care of. What's more, Xu Le had long since gone to hell to report for reincarnation. The previous changes in his own temperament actually had nothing to do with Xu Le; they were more of a side effect of possessing the corpse.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze got back to the Lin family's home, before he even entered the building, he saw an old man in a padded cotton jacket with a wrinkled face sitting on the steps in the stairwell, smoking a long-stemmed pipe.\n\nNext to the old man were several fertilizer sacks. One bag likely held chickens and ducks, while another probably contained things like cured sausages.\n\n\"Ah Le!\" Seeing Xu Le walk up, the old man immediately stood up, walked over to him, and clapped him firmly on the shoulder. \"The boy's gotten taller again.\"\n\nZhou Ze cracked a smile. He didn't ask why his uncle was sitting in the stairwell smoking. In truth, there was no need to ask.\n\nEven if his uncle had come out to smoke his pipe so as not to pollute their home, he wouldn't have left the local goods he brought outside. This could only mean the Lin family didn't want him there—they hadn't even let him in the door.\n\nRecalling the tone and attitude of his sister-in-law on the phone earlier, it was more than enough to explain the Lin family's attitude toward his uncle.\n\nOf course, there was nothing to complain or be resentful about. His relationship with the Lin family was already on the verge of shattering; it was pointless to talk about who was right or wrong.\n\n\"Have you eaten?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not yet.\" The old man was very honest.\n\n\"I'll take you to eat.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze chose a restaurant, and after they went in, he ordered a few dishes and a bottle of *baijiu*.\n\nThe old man poured for himself and drank alone. After a few sips of liquor, it was clear he was in low spirits. He had obviously felt the Lin family's coldness. They were in-laws, after all, yet now they weren't even bothering to keep up appearances.\n\n\"Le-wa'er, if you're not happy here, why don't you just come home.\" The uncle patted his own chest. \"The government's targeted poverty alleviation policies are great now, the family doesn't have to worry about getting by anymore. You've been to university, too. Come back and we can start some kind of specialty farming or something. We won't live any worse than others.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's talk about it in a while,\" Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The uncle knew that Xu Le didn't drink, so he didn't ask Zhou Ze to drink with him. He slowly finished the bottle by himself, then ate two bowls of rice. After Zhou Ze paid the bill, he picked up his things and walked out of the restaurant with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Take this stuff with you. They don't want it, so you eat it.\" The uncle handed the woven plastic sacks to Zhou Ze. \"I have to catch the afternoon bus back.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Zhou Ze didn't try to make him stay.\n\nThe uncle must have a high tolerance for alcohol. Zhou Ze called a taxi for him, paid the driver in advance to take him to the bus station, and then carried the items back to the bookstore.\n\nXu Qinglang was sitting at the entrance, basking in the sun. Zhou Ze placed the pile of local specialties in front of him.\n\n\"Yo, what's all this?\"\n\n\"For you to use as ingredients.\" Zhou Ze found a chair nearby and sat down.\n\n\"Alright.\" Xu Qinglang didn't stand on ceremony; he hadn't been charging Zhou Ze for meals anyway. \"By the way, you told me your real name is Zhou Ze, but you've never really talked about your past. What did you do before?\"\n\n\"A doctor,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThere was no need to hide these things from Xu Qinglang.\n\nBesides, his identity was clean now, so he wasn't afraid of official scrutiny.\n\n\"A doctor? Then you and your missus really are a pair.\" Xu Qinglang leisurely blew out a smoke ring. \"Haven't seen your wife around for a few days.\"\n\n\"It's over,\" Zhou Ze said nonchalantly.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe two of them shared another cigarette, then Zhou Ze got up, pushed open the bookstore door, and went inside.\n\nWhen he went out that morning, he had asked Xu Qinglang to keep an eye on things, so he hadn't locked the door.\n\nHe sat down behind the counter, turned on the computer, and clicked an icon. A video feed appeared on the desktop.\n\nA while back, Zhou Ze had bought two pinhole cameras and placed them in the shop. One was positioned at the stairwell, and the other in the upper-left corner of the One Mouth Bookstore. They weren't expensive—the kind of thing peeping toms usually buy.\n\nHe casually picked up the cup on the counter, took a few sips of water, and began to adjust the playback time on the video.\n\nThere was a reason why Zhou Ze had deliberately left the door unlocked that morning and asked Xu Qinglang to keep an eye on things.\n\nYesterday, Lady Bai had invited him over, and at the same time, had sent a sedan chair for Xu Qinglang. Although she had explained it was because of a playful remark Xu Qinglang made as a child, Zhou Ze didn't fully believe her.\n\nHe had brought the corpse back and kept it here. If Lady Bai and Xu Qinglang had some other connection, then Xu Qinglang should have made some move this morning.\n\nOne can't be too careful. He wasn't even human anymore; naturally, he had to be more cautious.\n\nAt 11:30 AM, the footage showed Xu Qinglang entering his shop.\n\nZhou Ze took another sip of water. The water in the cup felt a little sweet, exceptionally tasty.\n\nIt must be psychological, right? Was he feeling smug because he thought he'd guessed correctly?\n\nHowever, the footage only showed Xu Qinglang entering the shop, grabbing a few newspapers, sitting and reading for half an hour, then putting the papers back where he found them and leaving. He never went up to the second floor at all.\n\nWas he wrong? Judging a gentleman's heart with one's own petty measure?\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips, gave a self-deprecating smile, and drained the water in the cup.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to close the video and go wash his face, he suddenly remembered the camera positioned at the stairwell. This camera's position could monitor the stairs and the area on the counter side of the first floor.\n\nBut since Xu Qinglang hadn't gone any further in, it didn't really matter whether he checked it or not.\n\nHowever, because these kinds of cameras were cheap, their memory was small, so Zhou Ze still had to delete the used memory to free up space.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze also casually clicked open the video recorded by the second camera and scanned through it from beginning to end, just going through the motions.\n\nBut in that instant, Zhou Ze thought he saw a fleeting white shadow.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\nZhou Ze instinctively pulled the mouse back. His other hand reached for the cup again, only to realize the water was already gone.\n\nHe couldn't be bothered to go refill it now.\n\nInstead, he dragged the mouse, moving the video forward bit by bit.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe footage captured that moment,\n\nA woman in white clothing was slowly walking down from the second floor!\n\nThat corpse,\n\nit could move!\n\nZhou Ze felt a rush of blood to his head. A sense of crisis hit him directly, and both his heart and his breathing quickened.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was pondering this,\n\nthe video continued to play.\n\nIn the footage,\n\nLady Bai's corpse walked to the edge of the counter and picked up the water cup that was sitting there.\n\nThen,\n\nlike a dog drinking water,\n\nshe stuck her tongue out and swirled it around in the cup a few times.\n\nAfterward, she put the cup down, like a sleeping person who got up in the night, thirsty for a drink.\n\nShe then turned and slowly walked back upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, looking at the cup beside him, which he had just drained.\n\nNo wonder when I was drinking the water just now,\n\nit tasted a little sweet...\n***\n¹`公務猿` (gōngwùyuán): A pun on `公務員` (gōngwùyuán, civil servant). `猿` means \"ape\" and is a self-deprecating internet slang term for office workers, implying they are like code monkeys or wage slaves.\n\n²`空間` (kōngjiān): Literally \"space,\" it refers to Qzone, a once-popular Chinese social networking service by Tencent, similar to a personal blog or Facebook wall.",

    "content": "Second floor.\n\nBy the freezer.\n\nZhou Ze stood there for about half an hour.\n\nMadam Bai was still lying inside, exactly as she had been when Zhou Ze had gotten up and left that morning, without the slightest change. But the scene recorded by the security camera couldn't be wrong.\n\nEspecially…\n\nThat cup of water.\n\nHe had thought it tasted a little sweet when he first started drinking it.\n\nThis wasn't a psychological trick; he hadn't watched the video before drinking the water.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze wasn't overly disgusted by the fact that he'd drunk her saliva. After all, just last night he had watched Xu Qinglang eat so many \"delicacies from land and sea.\"\n\nCompared to Xu Qinglang, what he’d just done was merely a drizzle.\n\nOf course, he didn't find it \"romantic\" either.\n\nNo matter how beautiful the woman before him was, she was just a corpse. A corpse that had lain underground for two hundred years.\n\nThe thought that she hadn't brushed her teeth in two hundred years was something the mildly germaphobic Zhou Ze found a little hard to accept.\n\nShe could move. And she had gone downstairs to drink water, then come back up.\n\nHad Madam Bai not told him the truth?\n\nOr, there was another possibility: because of his fingernails last night, this corpse had also undergone some kind of change.\n\nRight now, Madam Bai's soul had already reported for duty in Hell. It was unlikely she would deliberately leave a time bomb behind in the mortal world.\n\nThe little loli once said that ghosts in the mortal world had to tuck their tails between their legs and \"act human.\" Anyone who wanted to stir up trouble was tired of living, tired of their comfortable existence.\n\nHowever, the feeling Zhou Ze got from having a corpse on his second floor was completely different from having a *moving* corpse on his second floor. No one wanted a dangerous, unstable element right next to where they slept.\n\n\"Hey, big sister, how about you wake up and we have a chat?\"\n\nZhou Ze said, leaning against the edge of the freezer.\n\nHe hoped the female corpse would open her eyes right then, either to fight him or to talk to him. They could find common ground while acknowledging their differences—at least get everything out in the open and stop with the mystery.\n\nBut the female corpse remained motionless, still lying there.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then reached his hand inside and began to run it over the corpse's body. He even desecrated some of her more sensitive areas,\n\nhoping the corpse wouldn't be able to bear the \"indecency\" and would open her eyes in anger.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nthe female corpse just lay there, cold and icy.\n\nUnmoved.\n\nZhou Ze figured that even if he actually dropped his pants and mounted her, the female corpse would maintain this state.\n\nHe withdrew his hand and pursed his lips, unsure of what to do.\n\nYou can't wake a person who's pretending to be asleep.\n\nThe next moment, the nail on Zhou Ze's fingertip began to lengthen. Then, Zhou Ze pierced his index fingernail into the female corpse's arm and slowly began to apply pressure.\n\n*Pfft...*\n\nThe nail, like a sharp blade, pierced the corpse's arm. No fresh blood flowed out; instead, a cloud of black qi began to spread, and for a moment, the entire second-floor room became ghostly and grim.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, what are you doing!\"\n\nXu Qinglang's shout came from downstairs.\n\nImmediately after, Xu Qinglang recklessly charged up to the second floor. Just then, Zhou Ze withdrew his hand. His fingernail seemed to be coated with a layer of frost; it felt a bit stiff and slightly painful.\n\n\"Are you crazy!\" Xu Qinglang looked at the narrow wound on the female corpse's arm and roared, \"When a Hanba appears, the land turns barren for a thousand li, don't you know that!¹\n\nThis female corpse definitely can't compare to a Hanba, but if the aura stored inside her body leaks out, it's enough to start a plague in Tongcheng!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to deal with the exasperated Xu Qinglang. Instead, he kept staring at the corpse's arm. The wound he had just made was actually healing on its own.\n\nThis female corpse...\n\nOther than her body being cold and her not breathing, she was really no different from a living person in every other respect. In fact, her body was even more vigorous than a living person's!\n\n\"Hey, you and I dug this thing up together! If this thing causes any trouble, I'll have to face the music too! It'll cost me years of my life, and maybe even bring disaster upon my descendants!\n\nSame goes for you. If you blow this up, even if you're a Ghost Emissary now, you won't be able to handle the consequences.\"\n\nThe small amount of black qi that had just leaked from the female corpse slowly dissipated. Because the amount was small and only Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were present—and their resistance was relatively strong—it wouldn't cause any harm.\n\nBut what had just leaked out was merely the tip of the iceberg of what was inside her body.\n\nZhou Ze sighed. \"Xu Qinglang.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"How about you take your wife back to your place? Didn't your parents just leave? Let her keep you company. After all, you were properly married to her with an eight-bearer sedan and a formal matchmaker.\"\n\n\"What? What do you mean by that?\" Xu Qinglang was completely bewildered.\n\n\"This thing... she can move on her own,\" Zhou Ze stated the reason. \"Today, she went downstairs by herself and even drank some water.\"\n\nA look of horror appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. The corner of his mouth twitched, and he took two steps back.\n\nHe had said last night that if anything unexpected happened to this corpse, it would turn into a *jiangshi*. And not the dumb-headed, \"ooh-ah-ooh-ah\" weaklings from Western movies that you could easily headshot, but a true *jiangshi* that would \"eat raw flesh and drink blood\" and might even possess supernatural powers.\n\n\"Thanks, but I'm getting used to being alone.\"\n\nWhat a joke. There was no way Xu Qinglang would take this hot potato—no, this hot *atomic bomb*.\n\n\"Don't you have some kind of paper talismans? Stick some on her,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The talismans for my two blades would only have the opposite effect if I stuck them on her. They'd provoke her,\" Xu Qinglang said with a bitter smile.\n\n\"Then what do we do?\" Zhou Ze felt a headache coming on. \"Haul her out to sea and dump her? Even if she turns into a *jiangshi*, at worst she can go bother the Sea Dragon King.\"\n\n\"She can't leave Tongcheng. She was a person of Tongcheng in life, and she's a ghost of Tongcheng in death. If her body leaves the Tongcheng area, she'll run into problems too. Otherwise, why didn't Madam Bai deal with her before descending to the underworld after her merits were fulfilled?\"\n\n*Clap!*\n\nZhou Ze slammed the freezer lid shut. Clearly, this problem was unsolvable.\n\nCouldn't burn it.\n\nCouldn't move it.\n\nAfraid of an accident if they dumped it somewhere else.\n\nSo he could only keep it in his own house and watch over it at his own risk?\n\nZhou Ze now seemed to understand a little why the little loli had gone \"biu\" and shot off to Hell. Being a civil servant for the underworld wasn't so great after all.\n\nEven after getting into the system, those doing the grunt work at the bottom were always the most miserable.\n\nJust like himself right now.\n\n\"Look on the bright side. I'll make you extra plum juice tonight,\" Xu Qinglang comforted him.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then I'm moving. Didn't I say I was going to open a shop in one of the counties down below? I'm thinking of moving my plan up.\" Xu Qinglang had a \"better you die than me\" look on his face.\n\nAfter locking the freezer, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang went downstairs together.\n\nXu Qinglang nagged Zhou Ze a bit more not to mess around before heading back to his noodle shop. He had probably been busy with his own things, but the leak of malevolent qi had scared him into running over.\n\nZhou Ze sat down behind the counter.\n\nHe picked up the water cup and swirled it in front of him.\n\nHis phone rang. He pulled it out and saw it was an unfamiliar number.\n\n\"Hello, is this Mr. Xu Le? We're from the Chongchuan Traffic Police Brigade.\"\n\n\"Yes, this is he. What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Is Xu Dachuan a relative of yours? He was just in a car accident and is now being sent to the People's Hospital.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm on my way.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes and let out a dissatisfied grunt. Things were annoying enough as it was, and now something else had come up. Xu Dachuan should be the uncle he had treated to lunch.\n\nBut he couldn't just not go. Although the man had come into the city specifically to see Xu Le, not Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze had already given the local produce he brought to Xu Qinglang as ingredients.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his fingernails.\n\nIf Xu Dachuan was really in mortal danger...\n\nShould he save him or not?\n\nThinking about the painful backlash he suffered after saving the little loli last time, Zhou Ze felt a shiver run down his spine. Forget it. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.\n\nHe walked out of the shop, hailed a taxi, and on the way, sent Xu Qinglang a WeChat message saying he was going out for a bit and for him to watch the place.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the People's Hospital, it was already eight in the evening. Zhou Ze asked at the front desk and learned that Xu Dachuan was not in mortal danger and had already been moved to a ward. He felt a sense of relief.\n\nPushing open the ward door, Zhou Ze paused as he walked in. He saw Doctor Lin standing by Xu Dachuan's bedside, talking with him.\n\nOne of Xu Dachuan's legs was propped up, likely broken. He also had a few scrapes on his face, but his spirits were good. He was quite animated while chatting with his nephew's wife.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, and his eyes met Doctor Lin's.\n\n\"Thank you. Sorry to trouble you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's what I should do.\" Doctor Lin stood up and added, \"I wasn't home during the day. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand.\n\nDoctor Lin left the ward. Zhou Ze stayed and chatted with his uncle for a bit longer. The long-distance bus had gotten into an accident before it even left the city. Xu Dachuan was just a bit unlucky, having fallen and fractured his left leg. The other passengers only had minor scrapes.\n\nXu Dachuan didn't seem to care much about his injury. Instead, he kept repeating, \"My nephew's wife is a good person.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, told Xu Dachuan to get some rest, and then left the ward.\n\nDoctor Lin was standing by the nurses' station. A young female nurse was sitting there, looking a little unwell.\n\nZhou Ze was about to leave, but he had to say goodbye to Doctor Lin. The two of them hadn't been in contact for a long time, but they still had to keep up appearances.\n\nHowever, as he got closer, Zhou Ze heard the sound of a baby crying. It was very faint, like a kitten.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't think much of it. But when he got closer to Doctor Lin, he noticed the baby's cry was clearer.\n\nCould it be that Doctor Lin was being haunted by a little ghost?\n\nZhou Ze was still observing, deliberately positioning himself to look from behind Doctor Lin.\n\n\"It's okay, Sister Lin. I just have a weak stomach, it's an old problem. I'll take some medicine later and I'll be fine,\" the young nurse said, thanking Doctor Lin for her concern.\n\n\"You need to take better care of yourself,\" Doctor Lin said comfortingly.\n\nIt was then that Doctor Lin noticed the somewhat... \"furtive\" Zhou Ze standing behind her.\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"Wait a second.\" Zhou Ze raised his hand and listened carefully again. Finally, he looked at the young nurse's stomach.\n\nThe sound wasn't coming from Doctor Lin; it was coming from inside the young nurse.\n\nHaving been a doctor before, Zhou Ze immediately understood what was going on.\n\n\"You're pregnant,\" Zhou Ze said to the young nurse. At a time like this, Zhou Ze couldn't afford to be tactful and drop hints to save face.\n\n\"What?\" The young nurse looked completely baffled.\n\n\"What nonsense are you spouting? Xiao Chen isn't married and doesn't have a boyfriend,\" Doctor Lin said, glaring at her \"husband.\"\n\n\"I don't know who the father is, but you'd better go get a check-up right now. Also, a word of warning, you're at risk of a miscarriage,\" Zhou Ze said with great certainty.\n\nThe fetus was very unstable. The faint, otherworldly cry represented the instinctive sorrow of an unborn child. This was why Zhou Ze hadn't worried about her feelings.\n\nA human life was at stake.\n\nHearing this, Nurse Xiao Chen shot to her feet, a look of anxiety on her face. Clearly, she hadn't known she was pregnant, but she knew she'd engaged in \"high-risk\" activities, so the possibility of conception was high.\n\nDoctor Lin saw it too and immediately rushed off with Xiao Chen.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, thinking it was a pity that Xu Le had studied civil engineering. If Xu Le had studied medicine, he probably would have quickly become the most famous doctor not just in Tongcheng, but in the entire Jiangsu province.\n\nHe went downstairs, bought a case of milk and some daily necessities for Xu Dachuan, and after dropping them off in the ward, he came out again. This time he really intended to leave; the person at home was truly making him uneasy.\n\nCoincidentally, Doctor Lin came out of the elevator, her expression somewhat grave.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"How did you know Xiao Chen was pregnant?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"I've studied some traditional Chinese medicine,\" Zhou Ze fabricated. \"How are things over there?\"\n\n\"Xiao Chen wants to keep the baby, but it's hard to say if she can. She wasn't paying any attention to it before,\" Doctor Lin said, then added, \"Are you heading back? Wait for me to change, I'll give you a ride.\"\n\nAnd just like that, Zhou Ze was in Doctor Lin's Cayenne, leaving the hospital.\n\nNeither of them spoke much on the way. Their \"marital\" relationship had hit rock bottom after the last incident.\n\nAs they neared the bookstore, Zhou Ze felt he should find a topic to talk about, otherwise it would be too oppressive. He said, \"You've posted a lot of pictures in Hanfu on your Moments. You like it a lot?\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" Doctor Lin nodded.\n\n\"I quite like it too.\" Zhou Ze rubbed the tip of his nose. \"Do you have any Hanfu? Maybe you could wear it for me to see someday?\"\n\nDoctor Lin didn't answer, seeming disinclined to pursue the topic.\n\nThe car stopped in front of the bookstore. Zhou Ze got out. To his surprise, Doctor Lin also got out of the car, looking like she intended to go into the bookstore with him.\n\n*Heh, this woman really is tough. Isn't she afraid of getting... you know... by me again like last time?*\n\n\"I'm going to grab a few magazines to read at work,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze nodded. He knew this was Doctor Lin's way of indirectly expressing a desire for reconciliation. This woman, it really wasn't easy for her.\n\nTo put it in the style of Lu Xun: this woman was once again bowing to feudal rites and laws, which is to say, to this nominal \"husband.\"\n\nIn ancient times, Doctor Lin would be a typical, pitiful woman poisoned and persecuted by feudal customs.\n\nPushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze was surprised to find Xu Qinglang sitting on a plastic stool, reading a book. But the book in his hands was clearly upside down. What the hell was he reading?\n\nXu Qinglang forced a smile at Zhou Ze that was uglier than a grimace.\n\nDoctor Lin gave the man, who was prettier than most women, a couple of extra glances, then walked straight toward the bookshelf to pick out magazines.\n\nZhou Ze handed Xu Qinglang a cigarette and whispered, \"What's with you? You look like you've seen a ghost.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe sound of footsteps came from the top of the stairs. A woman in an ancient white dress gracefully walked down, her figure lithe, exuding a natural tenderness.\n\nWhen she saw Zhou Ze,\n\nshe gave a slight curtsy,\n\nand said very respectfully,\n\n\"You've returned.\"\n\nThe magazines Doctor Lin had just picked up,\n\nfell to the floor.\n\nAt the same time, she said coldly,\n\n\"Looks like you won't need me to wear one for you.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1. **Hanba (旱魃):** In Chinese mythology, a Hanba is a type of zombie or drought demon whose appearance causes the land to become barren. Xu Qinglang is using this as a dire comparison for what the corpse could become.",

    "content": "\"Looks like there's no need for me to wear it for you.\"\n\nDr. Lin was indeed a very traditional woman, but she was not the type from ancient times who wouldn't dare say a peep even if her husband took a concubine, for fear of gaining a reputation for being jealous.\n\nShe had her own compromises, and at the same time, she had her own principles.\n\nShe could force herself to accept Zhou Ze's violation last time, and she could also force herself to slowly accept it as \"Xu Le\" (Zhou Ze) became more and more independent and assertive.\n\nBut she could not accept Zhou Ze having an extramarital affair. This was her bottom line.\n\nShe was angry.\n\nVery, very angry.\n\nShe even wanted to turn around and walk away.\n\nThe only reason Dr. Lin hadn't left right now was that she was waiting for Zhou Ze's response. No matter what, Zhou Ze ought to give her some kind of answer, and then things between them could finally be resolved.\n\nEven if it meant facing her mother's accusations and her father's fury that her marriage had brought shame upon the family, she would still accept it.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't respond.\n\nNo explanation.\n\nIt was as if he was tacitly admitting it.\n\nThe light in Dr. Lin's eyes immediately dimmed.\n\nWas an explanation not even necessary anymore?\n\nIn fact, Dr. Lin had misunderstood Zhou Ze. Right now, Zhou Ze hadn't even processed the situation, let alone noticed Dr. Lin's feelings.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, he felt a terror so great the hairs on his back were standing on end.\n\nThis female corpse…\n\nShe had actually come to life!\n\nAnd it wasn't as simple as coming downstairs for a drink of water like during the day. She had actually walked right up to him so openly, speaking to him, interacting with him!\n\nRecalling his \"wandering fingertips\" all over her body during the day, which he had done to \"awaken\" her…\n\nAn urge immediately rose in Zhou Ze's heart to rush out of the shop and run as far away as possible.\n\nNow he could understand why Xu Qinglang had been sitting there so foolishly, holding his book upside down. He didn't dare to move at all!\n\nThe scene fell into an awkward silence.\n\n\"Hello.\" The female corpse had a slight smile on her lips. After greeting Zhou Ze—much like a Korean or Japanese wife standing in the entryway to say \"Welcome home\" when her husband returns from work—she deliberately looked at Lin Wanqiu with a playful gaze.\n\n\"Hello,\" Dr. Lin replied icily.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. He reached out and pulled Xu Qinglang up, forcing him to his feet.\n\n\"Wanqiu, let me introduce you. This is my good friend and neighbor, the owner of the noodle shop next door who has over twenty demolition-compensated apartments, Xu Qinglang!\"\n\n\"Hello,\" Xu Qinglang said to Lin Wanqiu, but his eyes remained fixed on the female corpse beside him.\n\nHe was truly as delicate and dainty as could be, like a startled little quail.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"And this...\" Zhou Ze pointed at the female corpse. \"Is Xu Qinglang's beloved.\"\n\n\"Right... what?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned, but in the next moment, Zhou Ze's hand tightened slightly, and Xu Qinglang staggered, falling right against the female corpse.\n\n\"Right, this is my beloved. Her surname is Bai, and her name is Bai Suz… Bai Susu,\" Xu Qinglang said, looking at Lin Wanqiu while casually placing a hand on the female corpse's shoulder in a feigned show of intimacy.\n\nIn that instant,\n\nThe same icy cold feeling from last night shot straight to his soul.\n\n\"Ah... ooooh... hoo hoo hoo... mmmph...\"\n\nAfter a series of shivers, Xu Qinglang let go of his hand and said, \"Haha, darling, your body is so soft, I love touching it so much! Hahahahaha!\"\n\n\"You two carry on. Wanqiu, come outside for a second. I have something to tell you.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze took Lin Wanqiu's hand and, ignoring her reluctance, pulled her directly out of the bookstore.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, I suddenly remembered I have something important to tell you too! For example, the fact that I have too many apartments and want to give you one.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and made to follow Zhou Ze out.\n\nThe female corpse stood to the side, not moving, appearing dignified and serene.\n\nHowever, Xu Qinglang felt a terrifying chill wrap around his neck, as if he would be torn to shreds the moment he took another step outside.\n\nXu Qinglang wisely chose to stop and chuckled.\n\n\"Don't be angry, darling. How could I possibly give away an apartment? We'll wait until the country allows up to twenty children, and then we'll let our kids inherit them all. You'll even get a Hero Mother medal.\"\n\nHis face contorted with misery, Xu Qinglang sat back down on the plastic stool.\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze led Dr. Lin out of the bookstore, all the way to where she had parked her car by the roadside.\n\n\"What is it? Say it,\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"You seem to have gained some weight recently. Don't eat late-night snacks anymore.\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze pushed Dr. Lin towards the car.\n\n\"Hurry up and drive home. If you have nothing to do at night, go for a run or jump some rope or something.\"\n\n\"What exactly is going on?\" Dr. Lin grabbed Zhou Ze as he was about to turn back to the bookstore.\n\n\"Don't worry about it. Just go, now,\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nDr. Lin didn't say anything more. She got into her car, started the engine, gave Zhou Ze one last deep look, and drove away.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief, then squatted down by the road and lit a cigarette.\n\nTo be honest, he didn't want to go back to the bookstore. His rational mind told him that leaving with Dr. Lin was the smartest choice, but he couldn't. He was the one who had dug that female corpse out of that plot of land.\n\nZhou Ze didn't have a savior complex; he actually hated trouble. But regardless, even setting aside his current status as a temporary Ghost Official, if he let the female corpse truly run amok in Tongcheng, in his own hometown, and cause some kind of trouble, his conscience wouldn't be able to bear it.\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang, who was still in the bookstore…\n\nOh.\n\nXu Qinglang was still in the bookstore. Almost forgot.\n\nWhat a glutton for punishment.\n\nAlready dead,\n\nand still a glutton for punishment.\n\nHe blew out a smoke ring, dropped the cigarette butt on the ground, and stomped on it forcefully. Then, Zhou Ze walked straight toward the bookstore.\n\nAs he pushed open the bookstore door, a black light began to swirl in his eyes, and at the same time, his fingernails grew out.\n\n\"You're back again.\"\n\nThe female corpse was still standing there, her posture graceful, but the playful mockery in her eyes was much clearer than when Dr. Lin had been present.\n\n\"Get back upstairs and lie down properly.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at the female corpse and scolded her. No harm in posturing first, whether he could win or not.\n\n\"Do you guys prefer Durex or Jissbon? I have both at my place. I'll go get them for you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said as he tried to stand up and leave again.\n\nHe deeply regretted it.\n\nHe should have moved out during the day. Why did he have to linger here?\n\nHowever, the female corpse shot her hand out and grabbed at Xu Qinglang.\n\nA sharp cry escaped Xu Qinglang's throat: \"Boundless Heaven and Earth, Orthodox Heart of the Mystic!\"\n\nA bronze mirror appeared in Xu Qinglang's hand, pointed at the female corpse.\n\nBut in that instant, the bronze mirror shattered. Xu Qinglang was sent flying, crashing against the bookstore wall.\n\nThe power of the female corpse…\n\nwas horrifyingly immense!\n\nZhou Ze charged forward directly. This was his first real fight, and honestly, he had no confidence at all.\n\nHowever, the female corpse's gaze specifically fixed on Zhou Ze's hands, and she began to retreat, not daring to take a single step forward.\n\n\"Cough, cough...\"\n\nXu Qinglang climbed up from the floor, one hand on his waist. He had expected Zhou Ze to be swept aside just like him, but instead, he saw Zhou Ze relentlessly forcing the female corpse back. He immediately felt it was unfair.\n\n\"Damn it, no fair going easy on him!\"\n\nFinally, the female corpse was forced back against a wall. But in the next moment, she finally grew enraged and pounced at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze just subconsciously reached out a hand and grabbed forward.\n\n*CRACK...*\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nThe female corpse was slammed heavily against the wall, which even caved in slightly.\n\nAs she tumbled to the ground, the white dress over her chest was torn open. If it weren't for the undergarments she wore, she would have been completely exposed.\n\n\"Damn, he's that fierce!\" Xu Qinglang stood by, dumbfounded.\n\nAt the same time, a wave of fear washed over him as he recalled his original plan to use force on Zhou Ze to find out the secret of his reincarnation.\n\nThis neighbor of his, he really had never fought before. Xu Qinglang was certain that Zhou Ze's earlier fear and apprehension toward the female corpse were not faked.\n\nThe reason was simple.\n\nThis neighbor of his had no idea he was so good at fighting!\n\nIndeed, Zhou Ze didn't know how to fight.\n\nHe grew up in an orphanage, and it was a clean one where the children got along well, knowing how to be considerate and encouraging. After growing up, he became a doctor, a job dedicated to saving people. In his spare time, he had no interest in boxing or mixed martial arts.\n\nTherefore,\n\nnow that Zhou Ze actually had to fight, he himself felt it looked a bit ugly.\n\nBecause the female ghost was afraid of his fingernails, when Zhou Ze fought, it looked like a shrewish woman scratching faces, completely lacking the style of a Ghost Official.\n\nCompared to the little loli who could just open her mouth and intone, \"The Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" his coolness factor was far, far inferior.\n\nBut right now, none of that mattered. As long as it was effective.\n\nFor the Zhou Ze who had walked back with the intention of being torn apart by the female corpse, the current situation was truly wonderful.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe female corpse was sent flying again. Every time she got near Zhou Ze's fingernails, the black aura on them would instantly pierce her body, causing immense damage.\n\n\"Boundless Heaven and Earth, Orthodox Heart of the Mystic!\"\n\nTwo paper talismans appeared in Xu Qinglang's hands. He slapped them both onto the floor. In an instant, the chill in the bookstore seemed to lessen, and every time the female corpse landed, the talismans would tremble, and a searing heat would rise from beneath her, as if a fire were burning.\n\nThe female corpse's gaze shifted. She didn't dare face Zhou Ze anymore and chose to break through from the side. She was incredibly fast, attempting to shatter the bookstore's glass door and escape.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was now getting more and more into the zone.\n\nAs the saying goes, even if you've never eaten pork, haven't you seen a pig grunt?\n\nFrom the Hong Kong films of his childhood to the wuxia and cultivation movies that followed, everyone had seen the general gist of it.\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands, his dark eyes looking toward the main door.\n\nWhen the female corpse tried to smash through the glass door, streaks of black light suddenly appeared on the glass, as if they were scratches left by fingernails.\n\nThe female corpse let out a blood-curdling scream and was violently thrown back, landing on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze slowly walked forward, steadying his breathing at the same time.\n\nHowever, the female corpse, having been \"caught\" again, immediately fell to her knees. She pointed one finger at Zhou Ze while covering her face with her other hand.\n\n\"Sob... sob sob sob sob...\"¹\n\n\"I'll beat the shit out of you, you sobbing creature!\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out another paper talisman.\n\nBut the female corpse began pointing at Zhou Ze, crying with immense grievance:\n\n\"You touched me, and then you hit me! You're not human!\"\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched involuntarily.\n\nFor the female corpse who had just brought him and Xu Qinglang such immense pressure and terror to suddenly act like this really felt like a complete break in style.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still said in a serious, deep voice:\n\n\"I'm a ghost.\"\n\n---\nPS: Please send recommendation votes my way, smash 'em over here. Dragon just discovered our number one spot on the new book chart has been taken.\nSo, let's take it back.\n\n---\n¹ 嚶嚶嚶嚶嚶 (yīng yīng yīng yīng yīng) is onomatopoeia for whimpering, often used online to feign cuteness or play the victim. \"Sobbing creature\" or \"whimpering monster\" (嚶嚶怪, yīng yīng guài) is a slang term for someone who does this.",

    "content": "\"This one merely wished to tease you, Officer. Why must you be so heavy-handed?\n\n\"You truly are a heartless and faithless man, Officer. You touched me, you took liberties with me;\n\n\"And then you turn around and refuse to acknowledge it, even taking your anger for your wife out on me.\"\n\nThe female corpse spoke to herself through her tears, looking utterly wretched. Paired with the white dress on her body, which was now practically reduced to strips of cloth, she was a truly pitiable sight.\n\nPeople often say that those who live to be seventy or eighty have become as cunning as foxes. The female corpse before them, however, had lived for two hundred years, weathering the vicissitudes of time.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the female corpse's \"lament\" and turned his head to look at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Can we kill her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"...\" The female corpse.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, then nodded.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The baleful energy inside her is a problem. If she self-destructs at the last moment and her baleful energy leaks out, it will definitely affect the innocent people nearby,\" Xu Qinglang explained. \"That would be very troublesome.\"\n\n\"Mhm,\" the female corpse chimed in in agreement. She had more or less extinguished any thought of continuing to play the sympathy card with Zhou Ze. The most heartless are the faithless lovers; clearly, Zhou Ze had already been added to her little black book.\n\n\"But she wouldn't dare pull a stunt like that either. After all, her soul has already entered Hell. If she causes any kind of outrageous harm in the mortal world, the 'her' in Hell will also suffer punishment.\n\n\"So, yes, she can be killed.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had a cigarette dangling from his lips. A moment ago, he had been trembling like a quail about to be violated, but now, with Zhou Ze—who had just unleashed his inner power¹—by his side, he was perfectly capable of watching the show and making wisecracks.\n\n\"Don't kill me, don't kill me! She is her, I am me. We are two different people!\" the female corpse hurriedly shouted. She could tell that the two men before her truly wanted to solve her problem with a permanent solution.\n\nAny intelligent life form possesses a survival instinct, and the female corpse was no exception.\n\n*A thousand sails pass by the sunken ship; ten thousand saplings shoot up beyond the withered tree.*²\n\nThe female corpse was not actually Mrs. Bai. To a certain extent, she was an independent life form, a \"sentience\" born from Mrs. Bai's physical body over two hundred years. However, the female corpse and Mrs. Bai were still inextricably linked.\n\nXu Qinglang was right. The female corpse did not dare to do anything excessive in the mortal world. Even in death, she would not choose to act recklessly and cause the Mrs. Bai in Hell to be punished.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down in front of the female corpse. \"Then what did you mean just now? It was just for fun?\"\n\nThe female corpse nodded.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze chuckled twice. Thinking about it now, he was still a bit too \"young.\" As a new Ghost Official, he lacked experience, which was why he had agreed to Mrs. Bai's request in the first place.\n\n\"Is there no way to control her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"If you extract a wisp of her Corpse Soul Blood, you'll be able to control her. But you'll need her to give it to you willingly,\" Xu Qinglang suggested from the side.\n\nThe female corpse snapped her head up, her eyes flashing with intense hatred. She stared daggers at Xu Qinglang, as if, at that moment, he was her greatest enemy.\n\n\"Either die or hand over your Soul Blood. You choose,\" Xu Qinglang said, a smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"You... choose,\" Zhou Ze said, also looking at the female corpse. He clearly agreed with Xu Qinglang's suggestion.\n\nZhou Ze was a neat freak. He had no desire for a repeat of the female corpse inexplicably coming downstairs to clean his cup with her tongue.\n\n\"Fine, I'll give it to you.\" The female corpse took a deep breath, as if trying to bury her current resentment and anger. Then, she closed her eyes. Immediately, a wisp of something resembling a small red earthworm emerged from between her eyebrows.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pinched the thing with his fingernails, then pulled it out. He placed it in his palm; it felt somewhat warm and moist, and slippery to the touch.\n\nAfter surrendering her Soul Blood, the female corpse's spirit immediately became extremely listless. She nearly fainted, only managing to stay upright through sheer will.\n\n\"Go to the bathroom, clean yourself up, and then go upstairs and lie down. From this day forward, you are not to take a single step out of this bookstore without my permission,\" Zhou Ze warned.\n\n\"Yes, Officer.\" The female corpse lowered her head, her posture extremely submissive. With her Soul Blood in his grasp, she had no choice but to bow her head.\n\n...\n\n\"Smack.\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed the bottle of medicated liniment onto the table. He was clearly just applying liniment for Xu Qinglang, but the way he sounded made it seem like he was doing something disgusting.\n\n\"Rub it in yourself.\"\n\n\"Hey, come on! You weren't hurt, but I was thrown against the wall. I've got so many bruises. Don't you have even a shred of compassion?\" The more Xu Qinglang spoke, the more agitated he became. \"Zhou Ze, ever since you got here, have you noticed that I've been having nothing but bad luck?\"\n\n\"That's fate.\" Zhou Ze refused to take the blame for that. \"By the way, that incantation you were chanting earlier sounded really familiar.\"\n\n*Boundless Heaven and Earth, the Righteous Dharma of the Mystic Heart.*\n\n\"It's from a TV show. I thought it sounded cool, so I started using it. It doesn't actually help with casting spells at all,\" Xu Qinglang admitted honestly.\n\n\"So it's like adding your own BGM?\"\n\n\"Hah...\" Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes and started applying the liniment himself. \"There's some sour plum juice in the kitchen. Take it with you. I'm not opening the shop tomorrow morning, I need to rest more.\"\n\n\"I'm heading back to rest.\" Zhou Ze stood up, took the sour plum juice, and left. After returning to the bookstore, he went straight up to the second floor.\n\nThe female corpse had obediently washed herself clean and was now lying in the freezer, wearing Zhou Ze's clothes.\n\nThe white shirt was a bit large on her, the hem hanging down to cover the curve of her upturned rear. She wasn't wearing any pants, her legs crossed as she lay there, her eyes full of seductive charm.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and tapped the side of the freezer. \"I remember Mrs. Bai saying that she died before she was married.\"\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Bai should have died a virgin. But the female corpse before him seemed rather promiscuous.\n\n\"That's because she didn't tell you that she was forcibly drowned by her father for shaming the family after he discovered her fornicating with a poor scholar before her wedding.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you're an experienced old pro, then?\"\n\n\"Of course. Do you have any idea how much thought and effort she put into making me not look as horrifying as a drowning victim?\"\n\n\"Women, in the end, love beauty.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Go to sleep.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze placed a pillow next to the freezer and lay down.\n\nHaving the female corpse next to him, the chill emanating from her body felt very comfortable, even more pleasant than lying in the freezer himself.\n\nHe slept soundly. When he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze opened his eyes to see a pair of long legs dangling slowly in front of him, the curve of her instep arched just so.\n\nIf she were wearing stockings or high heels...\n\nWhen facing the female corpse, Zhou Ze found he could be more relaxed.\n\nNeither of them was human, so there was no need for pretense or hypocrisy. It was, conversely, more pure.\n\n\"If you can't hold back, I can lie down. I know you really want to do *that* kind of thing.\n\n\"It's not good to hold it in for too long, you know. Especially since your body isn't your original one. It could really cause problems.\"\n\nThe female corpse spoke very frankly, and then she smiled. \"Don't worry, I can't get pregnant.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked down the stairs to wash up, then began to cook instant noodles. Once everything was ready, Zhou Ze took out the sour plum juice and grimly completed his morning meal task, washing down the noodles with the juice.\n\n\"It's painful, isn't it? Eating human food,\" the female corpse said, sitting on the stairs, her head tilted as she watched Zhou Ze.\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\n\"You're clearly already dead, yet you insist on living like a human. Don't you find it tiring?\"\n\n\"You're talking a bit too much,\" Zhou Ze said with a slight frown.\n\n\"You said yesterday I wasn't allowed to leave the bookstore. Besides talking to you, what else can I do?\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the mop and broom from behind the counter and tossed them all to the female corpse.\n\n\"Do the cleaning.\"\n\n...\n\nThe sun was beautiful today. The female corpse was on her knees, wiping the bookstore's tiled floor with a rag, while Zhou Ze had moved a plastic stool outside the shop to sit and bask in the sun.\n\nIt wasn't until noon that Xu Qinglang finally opened his shop door and came out. He took a cigarette from Zhou Ze, glanced at the scene inside the store, and chuckled.\n\n\"You've trained her well.\"\n\nZhou Ze kept his eyes squinted, enjoying the sunlight.\n\nXu Qinglang blew a smoke ring, then said as if remembering something:\n\n\"That sign of yours is pretty nice, got a lot of style. It makes mine next door look shabby by comparison. I'm thinking of getting a custom sign made too.\"\n\n\"Trying to affect an air of culture?\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Why not?\" Xu Qinglang arched an eyebrow. \"If I put my twenty-some property deeds on display, who could say I'm not cultured?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"Come on, help me brainstorm. I think yours, 'Listen with skepticism; thus I have heard,' is pretty good. I'm thinking of making the horizontal scroll for my couplet 'Life is like a dream.' How about that? Sounds classy, right?\n\n\"But for the couplet itself, I think it'd be best to have it relate to 'eating,' to match my restaurant, right?\n\n\"I just can't think of a good one. Do you have any good suggestions?\"\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment, then said, \"You really want to hear it?\"\n\n\"Just say it,\" Xu Qinglang urged.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the female corpse inside the house and said:\n\n\"Man eats from the earth a lifetime,\n\nThe earth eats man one time.\n\nHorizontal scroll:\n\nLife is Like a Dream.\"\n\n---\n¹ A reference to the anime *Saint Seiya*, where characters \"erupt their cosmos\" to unleash their power. It's a common pop culture phrase in Chinese for someone suddenly showing immense strength.\n\n² A famous poem by Liu Yuxi (Tang Dynasty). It metaphorically speaks of new life and hope emerging even in the face of decay and loss, which is used here to describe the corpse's new sentience being born from Mrs. Bai's old body.",

    "content": "\"Here, have a taste. The new version of the sour plum juice.\"\n\nXu Qinglang placed a cup on Zhou Ze's counter. The plum juice in this cup looked richer in color than the previous batches; swirling it in his hand felt like holding a glass of wine.\n\n\"What's different?\" Zhou Ze asked before drinking.\n\n\"The flavor is heavier, a bit like aged yellow wine. The kick comes later. It'll keep you from wolfing down your food like before, thereby improving your quality of life.\"\n\n\"Hmph. What an affair.\"\n\nThe female corpse, who was organizing the bookshelves nearby, muttered sourly.\n\nZhou Ze took a sip. Unlike the sour plum juice he had before, this one was somewhat crisp and sweet, with a pleasant aftertaste. The flavor was excellent.\n\nHowever, this didn't seem to be the feeling he was looking for.\n\nBut just moments after tasting it, Zhou Ze felt a sharp, sour knotting in his stomach.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nHis body couldn't help but start trembling.\n\nThat lingering sourness...\n\n...was so overpowering.\n\nClenching his ten fingers slightly, then slowly uncurling them, Zhou Ze nodded, very satisfied.\n\n\"You're very thoughtful,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You're too kind.\" Xu Qinglang smiled faintly. \"I plan to make this one of my signature side dishes. A pity that few people will likely enjoy this kind of flavor.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze agreed on that point.\n\n*Creak.*\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and a group of students walked in. There were quite a few of them, seven or eight, and they all looked like the goody-two-shoes type.\n\n\"Boss, what's the WiFi password?\" a girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at the wall, where it was written.\n\n\"Whew...\"\n\nThe students each found a plastic stool to sit on. Then, the girl took out some homework from her backpack, divided it up, and had the others start copying.\n\nWinter break was about to end, so this was a fairly normal sight.\n\nZhou Ze certainly wasn't bored enough to go over and lecture these kids on the meaning of education and the evils of copying someone else's homework. He tapped his fingers on the counter, and the female corpse, taking the hint, walked over to pour him a glass of warm water.\n\nAt this point, the girl who had led the group walked over to the bookshelves, casually flipping through the books. After picking a few, she came to Zhou Ze. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Ninety-five,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Here, keep the change.\"\n\nThe girl was very generous, tossing down a one-hundred-yuan bill.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and said nothing more.\n\nBy the time it was past five in the afternoon, the students had finished copying their homework and left. The bookstore once again returned to the quiet tranquility it was meant to have.\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't in the shop; he had gone to get a sign custom-made. Of course, he wouldn't be ordering the kind of sign Zhou Ze had suggested—\n\n\"Man eats dirt his whole life, dirt eats man once.\"¹\n\n—because anyone with a half-decent brain could see that this sign was not suitable for a place where people eat, but rather for flanking a grave mound.\n\nThe female corpse, on the other hand, was quite brisk in her work. Today, she had cleaned both the first and second floors. Aside from occasionally striking a pose to show off her charms, she had basically no other flaws.\n\nShe hadn't said where she was going next, and Zhou Ze hadn't asked.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze remembered Lady Bai's reminder: \"On the next Winter Clothes Festival, burn the corpse with bamboo and wood.\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if Lady Bai knew that her corpse had, in fact, long since developed sentience.\n\nIf she did know, yet still entrusted it to him, while also telling him the method and time for its cremation, what was he to make of that?\n\nLast night, the female corpse had also admitted that even if Zhou Ze were to strike her down, she wouldn't disperse her own form and let her malevolent energy leak out to harm the innocent, which would implicate Lady Bai in Hell.\n\nHowever...\n\n...it seemed Lady Bai simply wanted to be rid of this problem cleanly.\n\nFrom that perspective, this female corpse he was using as a maid...\n\n...was actually quite a pitiful person.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My surname is Bai,\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"Bai what?\"\n\n\"Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"Bai *Yingying*?²\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. The name was a bit strange.\n\n\"Actually, you don't have to struggle so much when you eat.\" The female corpse stretched, her impressive figure becoming more prominent. \"It's like how you can sleep so soundly when you're with me.\"\n\n\"Your soul is tainted with the aura of Hell, but your body is still that of a living person.\"\n\n\"You need to sleep, you need to eat, to replenish your physical body. But your soul doesn't need these things, so it instinctively rejects and repels them.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"From now on, I can feed you.\" The female corpse gave a shy smile. \"After food passes through my mouth, carrying my... juices...\"\n\n\"...it will be equivalent to carrying the aura of a ghost. When you eat it then, it won't feel so unpleasant.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly understood why the glass of water last time had tasted a little sweet. It wasn't because the female corpse had a sweet mouth, but for this very reason.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't be polite.\"\n\nA man in a leather jacket walked in from outside the shop. His clothes were a bit rustic, his hair was somewhat disheveled, and his face was flushed—he had clearly been drinking.\n\nHe paced back and forth outside for a couple of rounds before finally pushing the door open and entering the bookstore.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze paid him no mind, but soon, his gaze sharpened slightly.\n\nThis man... he knew him.\n\nSun Tao, his former assistant. A... very promising young doctor.\n\nThe female corpse's eyes also narrowed. She gently poked Zhou Ze in the waist and said in a soft, sticky voice:\n\n\"Master, um, can I eat it?\"\n\nEat a person?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\n\"Master, didn't you notice? On that person's back.\"\n\nWith that reminder, Zhou Ze stood up. He saw a dark, murky thing clinging to the man's back.\n\nAn ordinary person might not know what it was, as its form was rather abstract, somewhat resembling a black maggot, yet with certain peculiar human-like features.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, because of his former profession, recognized it at a glance for what it was—a premature infant.\n\n\"Wuu wuu... wuu wuu...\"\n\nAs if sensing Zhou Ze's attention, the infant let out a soft cry.\n\nThe sound was somewhat familiar. Zhou Ze searched his mind for a related memory, and finally, he found the source of its familiarity.\n\nNurse Chen.\n\nTo be precise, it was the sound that had once come from inside Nurse Chen's belly, though at the time, only Zhou Ze had been able to hear it.\n\nZhou Ze felt no glee at his newfound ability to perform a \"paternity test.\"\n\nWhat welled up in his heart was only sorrow.\n\nThe child... hadn't made it after all?\n\nWhen the female corpse said she wanted to eat it, she wasn't referring to the person, but to the soul of that infant boy.\n\nZhou Ze shot her a glare. The female corpse pouted, not daring to say anything more. She could only stand to the side, swallowing her saliva resentfully, while touching her own heavy chest with a wronged expression.\n\n\"I don't eat the food of the living, and every night I have to be like a cauldron for you to harvest my malevolent energy.\"\n\n\"If I don't get some nourishment soon, these are going to deflate, and then you won't be able to secretly watch me while I work.\"\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily stunned. She had been aware of his gaze this whole time?\n\n\"You fiend,\" the female corpse chided coquettishly.\n\n\"Boss, you got any alcohol?\" Sun Tao called out.\n\n\"Go next door,\" Zhou Ze replied, but he still stood up and poured him a glass of water.\n\nAfter all, this was a junior he had once mentored. He himself had grown up in an orphanage, while Sun Tao had grown up in a single-parent home. Back then, he had ignored even a devoted fan like Doctor Lin, yet he had taken great care of this young man named Sun Tao.\n\nThere was no other reason, except that their personalities were very similar. Their childhood experiences had taught them the meaning of struggle and hard work; both wanted to fight to make something of themselves, to prove themselves.\n\n\"Pfft... hahahahaha...\" Sun Tao took the water, drank a big gulp, and then burst out laughing. \"Boss, why are you looking at me like that? I'm not interested in men.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze grunted.\n\n*With such a handsome man living next door, I'm in no danger of being interested in you.*\n\nSun Tao sat down on a plastic stool, bit his lip, and then shook his head.\n\n\"Boss, do you have kids?\"\n\n\"We're not ready for them yet. He thinks I'm too young,\" the female corpse interjected, desperately trying to insert herself into the drama.\n\nSun Tao looked up at the female corpse. Although her figure was full and she was tall, she looked to be about high school age. He immediately smiled.\n\n\"You really are still young.\"\n\nThe female corpse turned away in a huff, then swallowed another mouthful of saliva.\n\n\"I almost had a child,\" Sun Tao said, a bit emotional.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say, *You do have a child, and that child is clinging to your back.*\n\nWith the development of modern medicine and the \"modernization\" of people's thinking, abortion and induced labor were no longer such jarring terms. But few people knew that the resentment of an unborn infant was, in fact, the greatest of all.\n\nThese kinds of miscarried infants were the most likely to turn into ghosts, though, of course, their ability to seek revenge was actually very weak.\n\nAt most, driven by resentment, they would linger around their so-called parents for a time, and then they would dissipate on their own.\n\nThe female corpse wanted to eat it because this type of infant, having never been fully born, was like an ungerminated seed. To an entity like her, its \"nutritional value\" was extremely high.\n\n\"What happened?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"Girlfriend didn't agree?\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that although Nurse Chen had been uneasy and shocked at the time, she had said she wanted to keep the baby.\n\n\"No, she was willing. But I wasn't. I chickened out. I made her get rid of it.\"\n\nFor some reason, Sun Tao felt a strong urge to talk to this bookstore owner. In this man, he found a familiar, big-brotherly feeling.\n\nAnd that big brother had already been dead for over half a year.\n\n\"Chickened out?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Her parents always looked down on me. Heh, their family... is very well off.\" Sun Tao raised his head, seeming to suppress his tears.\n\n\"But what's done is done,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"But I wasn't willing to use something like that to blackmail her family. I don't want my colleagues, my friends, to think I used such methods to marry into their family.\"\n\n\"I don't want people to think I'm a Phoenix Man.³\"\n\n\"I'm not after their family's money, nor anything else.\"\n\n\"I don't want to get married and have a pair of in-laws looking down on me over my head, not to mention their whole clan of relatives.\"\n\n\"I grew up in a single-parent family, so I understand better than anyone that dignity is something you have to earn for yourself.\"\n\n\"Even if she was willing?\"\n\n\"Her being willing is her business, but I'm not willing. I want to live with my own dignity.\"\n\n\"Heh, when I first started out, an old-timer told me that dignity and the way others treat you are things you have to earn with your own two hands. I haven't achieved anything yet, so I don't want to...\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then asked, \"Did that old-timer of yours ever tell you something else?\"\n\n\"What?\" Sun Tao asked, surprised.\n\n\"That is, when you're having your fun, don't forget to wear a condom.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze swung his fist and smashed it right into Sun Tao's face.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nSun Tao took the heavy, unexpected punch and collapsed to the floor, completely stunned.\n\n\"Don't make excuses. Don't talk about dignity. Don't say anything else.\"\n\n\"You're just selfish. Thoroughly and completely selfish.\"\n\nAfter saying that,\n\nZhou Ze kicked the downed Sun Tao again.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nSun Tao curled up. He was in pain, and he was drunk, but he still shouted in anger:\n\n\"Are you crazy? Hitting people!\"\n\n\"That's right, I am crazy. I must have been fucking blind back then, to actually think about mentoring you and giving you a hand up!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe curled-up mass that had been hanging on Sun Tao's shoulder crawled in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nIts mouth let out a \"Zzzzzzzzz\" sound.\n\nThe female corpse heard it.\n\nZhou Ze heard it too.\n\nBut Sun Tao couldn't hear it.\n\nHis unborn child, who had never truly seen this world with its own eyes,\n\nwas, at this moment, baring its teeth.\n\nAt the person who was hitting its father,\n\nit let out an enraged cry...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"Man eats dirt his whole life, dirt eats man once.\"**: A grim Chinese saying reflecting a life of hardship (eating dirt) and the finality of death (being buried).\n2.  **Bai *Yingying*?**: Zhou Ze is making a pun.

    "content": "Zhou Ze sat down and stopped hitting the man. Truth be told, he really had no reason to hit him; whether or not to have a child was their own choice, a right they were free to exercise.\n\nAnd besides,\n\nnow even the sole aggrieved party,\n\nwasn't willing to lift a finger himself.\n\n\"Heh...\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\nSun Tao scrambled up from the floor, pointed at Zhou Ze, and yelled, \"What the hell is wrong with you? I'm calling the police! I'm getting a medical report for my injuries!\"\n\n\"You deserved it,\" Zhou Ze said, exhaling a smoke ring without even looking up.\n\n\"You... you... you...\" Sun Tao pointed at Zhou Ze, then shoved open the bookstore door and walked out. He silently cursed his bad luck; why on earth did he wander into this bookstore today of all days?\n\nThe infant tried to follow him out, but Zhou Ze snatched it in one swift motion.\n\nThe infant struggled, clearly unhappy, but Zhou Ze ignored its reaction, still pinning it to the floor.\n\n\"What are you following him for? Keep this up, and you won't even get a next life,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak...\"\n\nThe infant continued to struggle, completely deaf to Zhou Ze's words.\n\n\"Lord Emissary.\" The female corpse sidled up to Zhou Ze, casting a flirtatious, fawning look his way. She clearly thought Zhou Ze was keeping the infant for her to feed on.\n\nRight,\n\nmost men have a \"nurturing\" fantasy of their own.\n\nThe female corpse felt she was perfectly suited,\n\nboth in terms of age and figure.\n\n\"Lord Emissary... mmm... ah... Boss... mmm... ah... ah...\"\n\nThe female corpse swayed her body, giving a perfectly timed jiggle.\n\nThen, though the spirit was willing, the flesh was... not.\nThe effect was... spectacular.\n\n\"I can still keep growing, you know, as long as I get enough nutrition.\"\n\n\"Scram.\"\n\n\"...\" The female corpse.\n\n\"Help me watch him. Don't let him run. If you sneak a bite, you can die right alongside it,\" Zhou Ze said, standing up, his face expressionless.\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\nThe female corpse had no choice but to squat down and grab the infant with both hands.\n\n\"Boss, he's not going to call the cops, is he?\" The female corpse was afraid of trouble.\n\n\"He won't. A guy like him isn't going to make a scene and let the whole world know he got beaten up while drunk.\"\n\n\"Hmph. What a slave to his pride,\" the female corpse said with disdain.\n\nActually, there was one thing Zhou Ze didn't say: that guy's personality was, in fact, just like his own back then.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the palm of his right hand, slowly closed his eyes, and silently recited something in his mind. Then he opened his eyes again.\n\nWell,\n\nnothing happened.\n\nNext, Zhou Ze squatted down, extended his palm, and reached toward the infant.\n\nWell,\n\nstill, nothing happened.\n\nThe female corpse holding the infant was bewildered at first, but she quickly realized what Zhou Ze was trying to do. Her body trembled slightly as she fought to keep from laughing.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the female corpse. \"If you can't hold it in, don't.\"\n\nIndeed, Zhou Ze himself had to force a bitter smile.\n\nThe little loli said she had placed the key to the Gate of Hell in his hand, yet the first time he intended to open the gate and send a ghost in, he had no idea how to actually open it.\n\nIn any case, it was unlikely the little loli was just playing a joke on him, simply branding something like a tattoo onto his hand.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha... How could this humble servant dare to laugh at you, Boss...\nHahahahahaha... This humble servant wouldn't dare be disrespectful to the Boss...\nHahahaha-ha.\"\n\n\"Alright, do you know how to open it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe female corpse shook her head. \"Boss, that's something I really don't know. Perhaps there's an incantation?\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze silently recalled what Xu Qinglang had told him about the scene when the little loli took his parents' souls.\n\nHe immediately opened his hand and said in a deep voice:\n\n\"By order of the Netherworld, the Yellow Springs may be crossed.\"\n\n\"*Whoosh*...\"\n\nOutside the glass door, a withered yellow leaf blew past.\n\nA crow even seemed to fly by, cawing, \"Caw... caw... caw...\"\n\nInside the bookstore, it remained utterly silent.\n\nIn short, still no reaction.\n\n\"Maybe try a different incantation?\" the female corpse suggested. \"Everyone has a style that suits them, right?\"\n\n\"What, you want me to shout 'Open Sesame'?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Well, that depends on what *position* you prefer, Boss.\"\n\nThe female corpse said it with an air of childlike innocence.\n\nZhou Ze recalled that during the fight that night, Xu Qinglang had also shouted the incantation \"Boundless heaven and earth, the true law of the arcane heart\" before producing a talisman and a bronze mirror.\n\nBut as Xu Qinglang later admitted, that was just a line he'd picked up from a TV show because it sounded cool, kind of like a character's entrance music.\n\nIn reality, it was completely useless.\n\nThinking about it now, the phrase the little loli had said with her mouth open and tongue out—\"By order of the Netherworld, the Yellow Springs may be crossed\"—was probably also just to add to the cool factor.\n\nIt seemed the little loli's sense of fun wasn't much different from Xu Qinglang's, even if she was a senior ghost emissary.\n\nWith a thought, the nail on Zhou Ze's left index finger began to grow long.\n\nThe female corpse showed a look of fear. She was afraid of Zhou Ze, and what she feared most was his fingernail. It emanated an aura that terrified her.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze himself suspect that the old man who had died in front of him might not have been so simple.\n\nStowaways came in two types: one was like his former self, having to live with their tail between their legs; the other was like the one in Rongcheng that the little loli mentioned, who caused a lot of trouble, so much that even the ghost emissaries found it difficult and thorny.\n\nIn any case, the old man who had infected him with nail fungus was probably not so simple.\n\nThe black nail pierced the mark on the palm of his right hand. Then, as Zhou Ze pulled the nail out, he drew out a black thread.\n\nIt was like hot caramel, thick and viscous, yet it didn't break.\n\nZhou Ze used the pulled thread to draw a square,\n\nand immediately,\n\nthe square began to float.\n\nThe space inside it turned black and empty, and gusts of chilling wind began to blow out.\n\nThe infant in the female corpse's hands began to struggle. Clearly, it didn't want to go back to Hell.\n\nA person's death is like a lamp going out,\n\nbut few can truly accept it with grace.\n\nCountless people in their seventies and eighties, even those who had spent a lifetime committing heinous acts, would try every means possible to cling to life, to say nothing of this little infant.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that sending it to Hell, to await a new beginning and reincarnation, was the right thing to do.\n\nHe didn't need to ask for its opinion. In that moment, Zhou Ze was mercilessly blunt. He grabbed the infant directly from the female corpse and tossed it straight into the pitch-black square.\n\nAfterward, the square slowly dissipated, leaving a faint smell of burning in the air.\n\nThe female corpse stuck out her tongue but said nothing.\n\nZhou Ze, however, seemed a bit lost in thought. In the end, this was the first time he had sent a ghost back to Hell. He hadn't even done so with the woman who wanted to stay for her son's college entrance exams.\n\n\"Hell, have you ever been there?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No,\" the female corpse answered honestly. \"And I can't go down there.\"\n\nThe female corpse had no soul of her own.\n\nA jiangshi is beyond the Five Elements, outside of reincarnation's cycle.\n\nThat might sound impressive,\n\nbut it comes with a postscript:\n\nHated by men, loathed by ghosts, abandoned by Heaven!\n\nThis meant that if the female corpse were to go for a stroll for no reason, there was a chance a bolt from the blue could strike her in broad daylight and reduce her to ash.\n\nThe world was just that unfriendly to her.\n\nHumans have the mortal world,\n\nghosts have Hell,\n\nand any existence that belongs to neither is an aberration.\n\nZhou Ze sat back down behind the counter. He didn't feel happy, just a sense of tedium and boredom.\n\nIf the mortal world was a production line, then all he was doing was tossing defective products into the incinerator to be melted down and remade.\n\n\"Boss, there's a stack of this here.\"\n\nThe female corpse picked up a few bills of Hell money from the tile floor and handed them to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised; he hadn't expected to get paid this time.\n\n\"The King of Hell is easy to see, but his minor demons are a pain to deal with.\" The female corpse regretted her words as soon as she said them, but she braced herself and continued, \"It's standard practice for ghost emissaries to skim a little off the top when escorting souls.\n\nI suppose his mother must have burned him paper money before.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and took the Hell money. The bills he had left from last time were in a drawer behind his counter. Even with these few added, it was still not much.\n\n\"Do you know any other friends? Refer some business my way. To be a person... oh no, to be a ghost, one must also read more books to improve.\"\n\n\"Boss, this humble servant only knows some lonely, wandering ghosts. They lost their incense offerings long ago and have no money. Besides, they wouldn't dare come near you. If you were to collect them, wouldn't they just be padding your performance quota for free?\"\n\n\"Quota?\" This was the first time Zhou Ze had heard the term. \"Being a ghost emissary comes with a quota?\"\n\n\"It doesn't?\" the female corpse asked, a little puzzled.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" Zhou Ze shrugged. He really didn't know, because the little loli had just left him with a single line—\"You're the most self-aware person I've ever met\"—and then:\n\n*biu*\n\nshe was gone, down below.\n\nShe didn't leave him a copy of *The Ghost Emissary's Code of Conduct* or *How to Be a Ghost Emissary with Ideals, Ambition, and Purpose*.\n\n\"I suppose there must be,\" the female corpse said with some difficulty. \"It's like my former mistress. She lingered in the mortal world for two hundred years, protecting her home region, working diligently, all in the hopes of atoning for her past transgression of lingering and securing an official post after returning to Hell.\n\nIf her temple hadn't been destroyed and the incense offerings had continued, it wouldn't have taken nearly so long.\"\n\n\"Do you know any other ghost emissaries?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"How could this humble servant know so many Lord Emissaries?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded. It seemed he would have to find someone in the know to ask in the future.\n\nJust then, the sound of an electric scooter came from outside. Xu Qinglang was back.\n\n\"Man, I'm beat.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the bookstore and tossed Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n\"Didn't you go to order a new sign?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Got that ordered, then I swung by to pick up some stock. Wanchai Ferry is having a special, so I stocked up. It really wore me out.\"\n\n\"Your dumplings aren't made from scratch?\"\n\n\"Heh, the Coke at a fast-food joint is just bought from the supermarket next door and resold. Who has the time to wrap dumplings at home every day?\"\n\n\"Wanchai Ferry,¹ suits you.\"\n\n\"Right? I like that brand too... Hey, can't chat, I gotta go put these in the freezer.\" Xu Qinglang waved to Zhou Ze and went back to his own shop.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang left, the female corpse suddenly let out a \"pfft\" of laughter.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. \"You understood?\"\n\nThe female corpse smiled.\n\n\"He really is handsome. Most guys would probably turn 'bent' for him.\n\nSo,\n\n'Wanchai Ferry'.\"\n\n---\nPS: In view of the fact that since this book was published, readers in the review section have often commented that \"the author plagiarized *He Comes from Hell*\" or \"the author's beginning is very similar to *He Comes from Hell*,\" Long would like to issue a unified response:\n\n*He Comes from Hell* is a book written by Long.\n\n---\n¹ A pun. The brand \"Wanchai Ferry\" (灣仔碼頭, Wān Zǐ Mǎ Tóu) sounds very similar to \"bent-guy ferry\" (彎仔碼頭, wān zǎi mǎ tóu). \"彎\" (wān), meaning \"bent,\" is slang for gay.",

    "title": "Chapter Forty: Night Parade of One Hundred Demons",
    "content": "In recent years, Tongcheng has become a rather famous place—not for its economy, nor for its local delicacies, but for its college entrance exams.\n\nFor the vast majority of third-year high school students across the country, the Tongcheng Mock Exams were formidable enough to rival the Huanggang Secret Test Papers.\n\nOf course, none of this originally had any impact on Zhou Ze. His bookstore had long since shed its reliance on \"business from the living,\" having completed an industrial restructuring and transformation to earn money from the dead.\n\nHowever, the fatty who had sought him out once before had found him again.\n\nHis purpose was simple: the next semester was the college entrance exam semester, and the fatty planned to go big again with a business selling pirated secret test papers.\n\nThere were likely many twists and turns involved, and even an extremely complex chain of interests, none of which Zhou Ze was very clear about. In fact, Zhou Ze believed that Xu Le wouldn't be clear about them either.\n\nThe reason the fatty wanted to pull Xu Le in, both last time and this time, was purely to leverage some of Xu Le's student connections.\n\nIn this whole affair, Xu Le was essentially a middleman who satisfied both parties.\n\nDumb as a post,\nbut the most reassuring.\n\nPiracy was an unavoidable hurdle in contemporary Chinese society. The so-called \"knockoff\"¹ culture that it spawned, seemingly booming and in full swing, was even beginning to shed its derogatory connotations and evolve into a neutral term.\n\nBut when all was said and done, it was still illegal. Although the prevailing ethos made the phenomenon almost insurmountably common, if your luck ran out and you were actually targeted, it would be a very troublesome matter.\n\nZhou Ze turned the fatty down. The fatty left, somewhat dejected. Standing at the doorway as he left, the fatty lit a cigarette, fiddled with his gold-plated chain that was flaking, and cursed:\n\n\"Idiot.\"\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, continued to sit behind the counter, reading his book. The fatty's visit was nothing more than a minor interruption in his recent life.\n\nThe female corpse, as usual, sat in a chair after tidying up the bookstore, her eyes closed, leaning against the wall. It looked as if she were either zoning out or feigning sleep.\n\nThe lives of the two had taken on an air reminiscent of an old lady's foot-binding cloth—long, drawn-out, and stale.\n\nZhou Ze was perfectly content. He recalled that the thing he had most looked forward to in his past life was to live just like this: squandering his days, wasting time, reading books, and zoning out.\n\nNo need to be constantly ready to face emergency patients, no need to perpetually push himself to climb the ladder, bit by bit.\n\nAs for the female corpse, she had lain in a coffin for two hundred years and was long accustomed to monotony and silence. This was just a drop in the bucket.\n\nCompared to the \"still as water\" calm of the bookstore, Xu Qinglang was far more ambitious and driven. He was wealthy and didn't have any great aspirations in the realm of metaphysics; instead, he was focused on how to earn money and build a career through his own abilities.\n\nBecause of this, Xu Qinglang was quite displeased with the decadent style of the master and servant next door!\n\n\"Look at you, as lazy as a dead man every day,\" Xu Qinglang said, coming over for his customary cigarette and to heap some scorn on Zhou Ze after finishing his own day's work.\n\n\"I *am* a dead man,\" Zhou Ze said, waving his hand and blowing out a smoke ring.\n\n\"Look at you. A man who's lived two lifetimes, and you still barely have any money to your name. I, on the other hand, am a man with over twenty properties, and I'm still striving and fighting.\"\n\nAs was his custom, after belittling Zhou Ze, he had to praise himself.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang and smiled. \"Are you preparing your own dowry?\"\n\n\"A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory,\"² Xu Qinglang retorted. He raised his head and looked up at the night sky (the ceiling). \"I want my retirement to be a bit more comfortable.\"\n\n\"Your twenty-plus houses for the living already attracted a Ghost Lady to come carry you off for marriage in an eight-man sedan chair. If you work a little harder, earn more money, buy more properties, maybe next time some Ghost Queen or the like will find you a suitable match. Then I, a humble ghost emissary, could bask in your reflected glory.\n\nIf you get rich, don't forget me.\"\n\n\"Hehe,\" the feigning-sleep female corpse chimed in, perfectly backing up her boss.\n\n\"It's almost eight. I need to get ready,\" Xu Qinglang said, checking the time.\n\n\"For what?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nNormally, Xu Qinglang turned in quite early at night.\n\n\"The Confucian Temple is opening its gates today. The college entrance exam is just a few months away, isn't it? I have a relative back home whose kid is taking the exam this year, and they asked me to go to the Confucian Temple to burn incense for him.\"\n\n\"You're willing to do something like that?\" Zhou Ze knew Xu Qinglang's personality. Calling him aloof and selfish was going a bit too far, but he was generally too lazy to bother with anything other than making money.\n\n\"I ate at their house when I was a kid and received their help. Otherwise, I don't even know if I would have survived long enough to get the demolition compensation money. So, this favor has to be repaid,\" Xu Qinglang said with a straight face.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Hey, want to come along?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly invited. \"Help me snag the first incense offering?\"\n\n\"The Confucian Temple cares about the first incense offering?\"\n\n\"Hey, it's a good omen, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm not strong enough.\" Zhou Ze had seen how insane people could get when fighting for the first incense offering. His body couldn't handle it, unless he used his fingernails to clear a path, but he couldn't just take down everyone around him, could he?\n\n\"Ask her.\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the female corpse. \"Strong as an ox. She can run interference for me.\"\n\nThe female corpse frowned, preparing a sarcastic retort.\n\n\"Don't you want to go out for a stroll?\" Xu Qinglang raised his eyebrows.\n\nThe words on the tip of her tongue were immediately swallowed, and her face blossomed into a radiant smile.\n\nIn all this time, she hadn't taken a single step outside the bookstore.\n\nLeft with no choice, Zhou Ze could only nod in agreement. He didn't feel safe letting the female corpse run off on her own. She might be as attentive as a maidservant now, but you can't know a person's heart, let alone the heart of a zombie that doesn't have one.\n\nZhou Ze even believed that if his powers were to disappear one day, the first to devour his flesh and blood would likely be this very female corpse who was now fawning over him.\n\nThe three of them took a taxi to the Confucian Temple. To say the area outside the temple was a sea of people would be an exaggeration, but it was still packed three layers deep inside and out.\n\nThe pitiable hearts of parents everywhere.\n\nOutside the temple, Xu Qinglang met up with the relatives he had mentioned, a middle-aged couple who looked very honest and kind.\n\nTheir son, of course, had not come. Everyone here was competing for a good omen; no one was foolish enough to believe this could actually guarantee a passing grade. You could hardly see anyone of student age in the crowd; they were likely at home studying.\n\nThe Confucian Temple in Tongcheng \"washes its gates\" after the Lunar New Year. As for why not before the New Year, perhaps the master scholars in the temple felt that competing for incense with all the ghosts, demons, mountain spirits, and wild monsters during the new year was beneath their dignity.\n\nBetter to do it after the New Year.\n*Look at how deserted your gates are, while here I have clouds of devotees.* It was a better way to display its class.\n\nAs for the specific reason, or how things were done in other parts of the country, Zhou Ze didn't know. A custom is, by definition, a set of inexplicable rules. Who could say for sure?\n\nJust like that recent incident hyped up online, from the city next to Tongcheng, where a father-in-law kissed his daughter-in-law at the wedding. That could also be chalked up to a so-called \"custom,\" which made even less sense.\n\nWith a creak,\nthe red wooden doors were opened.\n\nIn that instant, the waiting parents transformed into ferocious beasts, charging into the Confucian Temple.\n\nThe female corpse led the charge, with Xu Qinglang and his two relatives close behind, giving off the air of Zhao Zilong at the Battle of Changbanpo.³\n\nZhou Ze didn't join the frenzy. He just squatted on the curb outside, smoking a cigarette.\n\nAs he smoked, Zhou Ze was surprised to find the lit end of his cigarette suddenly go out.\n\nZhou Ze relit it, but his next drag was completely tasteless.\n\n\"Heh,\" Zhou Ze dropped the cigarette butt and glanced around. He knew that his cigarette had been taken as an incense offering.\n\nIt didn't want pure incense, nor did it care for proper tribute.\nIt just wanted a drag of a mortal's cigarette.\nHe had no idea which ghost or demon it could be.\n\nNaturally, Zhou Ze didn't feel a surge of \"Fuck, how dare you steal my smoke?\" anger. He had been an illegal stowaway a month ago and had only been promoted to a temporary worker half a month later.\n\nHe didn't have a shred of the \"when one man gets to heaven, all his dogs and chickens ascend with him\"⁴ or \"this road is mine\" kind of domineering aura.\n\n\"CLANG!\"\n\nA gong sounded.\nIn the night, it was so abrupt, so piercing.\n\nZhou Ze followed the sound with his eyes.\nFrom the flowerbed behind the Confucian Temple, a short, dwarfish old man emerged. The old man held a brass gong and had a cigarette dangling from his lips as he skipped his way out.\n\nThe old man gave Zhou Ze a deliberate glance, opened his mouth, and blew out a smoke ring, as if to signal his thanks for the cigarette.\n\nZhou Ze smiled back.\nHe lit the rest of the cigarettes in his pack with his lighter, laid them one by one on the ground, and kept only one for himself.\n\nSoon, the cigarettes on the ground all went out. The dwarfish old man skipped even more gleefully, seeming to take a greater liking to this junior who knew how to play along. His small pockets were bulging, likely full of cigarettes.\n\nThe dwarfish old man cleared the way with his gong.\nBehind him, a group of people slowly followed.\nNot the parents who had just crammed into the temple,\nbut a group of strangely attired people.\n\nThe ones at the very front wore feather fans and silk kerchiefs, their steps staggering, their faces ashen. They slowly followed the old man's pace.\n\nBehind them were two men with greasy, long queues, their gazes vacant, who also continued to follow the old man forward.\n\nAfter them, the clothing of the people began to look more and more modern. The last few were even wearing contemporary clothes, no different from ordinary high school students.\n\nHowever, some of their faces were a sickly green, others had shattered skulls.\nOut of professional habit, Zhou Ze quickly deduced that the last few students had either died from poison or from jumping off a building.\n\nOne of them looked a little familiar. He seemed to recall seeing his photo while scrolling through the news a few years ago. The student had performed poorly on a mock exam and, under the pressure, had committed suicide by jumping off a building.\n\nThe dwarfish old man walked on, beating his gong, while the group of \"scholars and students\" behind him followed like puppets on a string.\nThey were like a parade procession,\ncircling the Confucian Temple.\n\nAnd the nearby pedestrians,\nother than Zhou Ze, could not see them.\n\n\"CLANG!\"\nA gong sounded.\n\"To live in peace, you need not build a tall mansion; within books, you will find a house of gold!\" the dwarfish old man roared in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"CLANG!\"\nAnother gong sounded.\n\"To marry a wife, do not fret over lacking a good matchmaker; within books, you will find a beauty like jade!\"⁵\nthe dwarfish old man continued to shout.\n\nAfter circling the Confucian Temple three times,\nthe strange procession slowly disappeared.\n\nA short while later,\nthe parents who had finished offering their incense began to walk out of the temple.\nTheir faces were filled with satisfaction,\nwith hope,\nwith the earnest desire for their children to succeed.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"Knockoff\" culture (山寨, shānzhài):** A term that originated from Cantonese to describe counterfeit goods, but has evolved to encompass a broader culture of imitation, parody, and grassroots innovation in China.\n2.  **\"A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory\" (狗嘴裡吐不出象牙):** A common Chinese idiom meaning that nothing good or refined can be expected from a coarse or foul-mouthed person.\n3.  **Zhao Zilong at the Battle of Changbanpo:** A famous episode from the classic novel *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, where the warrior Zhao Zilong single-handedly fought his way through a massive army to rescue his lord's infant son.

    "title": "Chapter Forty-One: The Most Awkward",
    "content": "Xu Qinglang, the female corpse, and the middle-aged couple all came out. The couple’s faces were beaming; clearly, with the female corpse’s help, they had managed to offer the first incense.\n\nWhether it was effective or not, it was a good omen nonetheless.\n\nEven parents who weren't superstitious would give their child a *zongzi* and a rice cake before a major exam, a pun for *gāozòng* (passing the exam).¹\n\nThe female corpse, however, did not look very pleased. As the group walked back together, she lagged behind by herself.\n\n“Let’s go get a late-night snack. How about barbecue?” Xu Qinglang suggested.\n\nHe ran a restaurant himself, but there was no way he was going to prepare a barbecue late at night.\n\nLady Xu’s skin was far too precious; how could he subject it to all that smoke and fire?\n\nHowever, the moment Xu Qinglang made the suggestion, he regretted it.\n\nIn this group,\n\nthere was a zombie, and also a living dead person who didn't partake of worldly food.\n\nJust imagining the dinner scene, with those two sitting there stock-still, like clay statues in a temple enjoying incense offerings…\n\nThe thought alone was enough to kill one's appetite.\n\n“You guys go ahead. We’ll head back first,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“Oh, we couldn’t possibly,” said the middle-aged man.\n\n“It’s fine, Uncle. We’ll go eat. Let the young couple have a walk by themselves.”\n\nXu Qinglang pulled the middle-aged couple away with him.\n\nZhou Ze wasn’t in a hurry to hail a cab. He and the female corpse walked along a small, nearly deserted road.\n\nThe weather was starting to turn warm, and the nights weren't as chilly as before.\n\n“What’s wrong?” Zhou Ze asked the female corpse.\n\nShe had been sullen ever since they left the Confucian Temple.\n\n“I don’t feel well,” the female corpse replied.\n\n“Still haven’t hit menopause?”\n\nIt’s been two hundred years, after all.\n\n“…” The female corpse was silent.\n\nAfter a moment, she finally spoke. “A few of the statues in the Confucian Temple were staring at me. It felt strange.”\n\n“You think they were looking at you?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Yes.” The female corpse nodded.\n\n“You think they disapproved of you?”\n\n“Yes.” She continued to nod.\n\n“You think it’s because you’re a zombie, so you shouldn’t have gone to a place like that?”\n\n“Yes.” The female corpse still just nodded.\n\n“The Sage advocated for education without discrimination.” Zhou Ze smiled and patted the female corpse on the head. “You’re a zombie, a creature hated by men and loathed by ghosts, but you went to the Confucian Temple to help someone offer incense, contributing to their offerings and popularity.\n\n“You feel like they were looking at you.\n\n“It might be because you’re special, so they were paying attention to you.\n\n“It’s like a husky suddenly mixing in with a pack of prairie wolves. Anyone would take a second look, right?\n\n“Of course, it’s also possible they’re just a bunch of clay statues. It’s said their eyes were made from donkey dung pellets to make them look more lively and lustrous.\n\n“All of it is just you putting psychological pressure on yourself.”\n\n“But what if they really were looking at me? What if they really had a problem with me…” The female corpse was still hesitant.\n\n“Then they don’t deserve to be enshrined in a temple as some so-called Sage!”\n\nZhou Ze’s voice was resolute.\n\n“A Sage enjoys millennia of incense and worship. If he doesn’t even have that much tolerance, what face does he have to sit on an altar in a temple?\n\n“And a false Sage is nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nThe female corpse looked at Zhou Ze, a smile gracing the corners of her lips. “Boss, what you just said was really commanding.”\n\n“Naturally.” Zhou Ze basked in his servant’s flattery.\n\n“But Boss, you’re a ghost emissary. There’s a predetermined fate in the unseen world. For an ordinary person, the repercussions might not be great, but for you, it’s different.\n\n“On top of that, you run a bookstore, a trade that falls under the auspicious fortune of the Sages. Slandering a Sage like that… it’s really not good for you.”\n\nIt was rare for the female corpse to speak so frankly from the heart with Zhou Ze. In the past, she would have been thrilled to see him court death.\n\n*Go on, dance yourself to death. I’ll be right here to collect your corpse, peel off your fingernails, grind them into powder, and drink it in tea like pearl powder.*\n\n*No, I’ll feed it to the pigs!*\n\n“It’s like I said: Do no wrong, fear no ghost… or Sage, knocking at the door.”\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the streetlight and continued,\n\n“In my past life, I treated the sick and saved lives. I never accepted red envelopes, never crossed my bottom line, and always abided by medical ethics.\n\n“In this life, even after becoming a ghost and borrowing a corpse to return to life, I haven't done a single thing to trouble my conscience.\n\n“What is there to be afraid of?”\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and repeated, “There’s nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nHearing this, the female corpse fell into contemplative silence.\n\nZhou Ze's words were not the declaration of an edgy teenager, but more like a warning to himself.\n\nThe two continued to walk aimlessly. The evening breeze was cool, yet very pleasant.\n\nFinally, the female corpse stopped and asked, “Boss, where are you going?”\n\nZhou Ze halted and subconsciously looked around, stunned to find that he had walked right up to the entrance of a residential complex.\n\nThe familiar surroundings,\n\nThe familiar gatehouse,\n\nThe familiar gatekeeper dozing off on the night shift inside the gatehouse,\n\nThe familiar package lockers.\n\nHe had just been strolling,\n\nand had naturally walked back to the complex where he used to live.\n\nAlthough he had been at the bookstore for a month, in his subconscious, this was still his home.\n\nHaving grown up in an orphanage, he understood the meaning of home better than most and, at the same time, was more attached to the idea of owning a house.\n\nFortunately, when he bought his apartment, housing prices in Tongcheng hadn't yet soared to the ridiculous levels they later reached. It was because he had been so eager to become a “mortgage slave” right after starting his job that he ended up picking a watermelon,² much to the envy of his colleagues who bought houses later.\n\nNow, however, Zhou Ze couldn't even recover his old WeChat or QQ accounts. There was no way to get through the phone verification, and asking friends on his list to verify for him would either make them think he was a lunatic or scare them to death.\n\nEven his own apartment had been sold by the hospital after his death, with the money donated to the orphanage in his name.\n\nZhou Ze didn’t resent this; after all, he had no other living relatives.\n\n“This is where I used to live,” Zhou Ze told the female corpse.\n\n“Well then, shall we go up and take a look?” the female corpse suggested.\n\n“It’s already been sold,” Zhou Ze said with a sigh.\n\n“Just think of it as revisiting an old haunt.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked over.\n\nHe entered Building 8, Unit 2, took the elevator up to the fifth floor.\n\nZhou Ze walked to a door. The door was the same; the new owner probably hadn't had time to renovate yet.\n\nEven the doormat was unchanged.\n\nAnd the potted cactus placed by the door was still there.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and felt under the pot, pulling out a key.\n\nBack then, he was often called to the hospital for emergencies at night and would frequently forget his phone or keys. So, he kept his spare key here to avoid locking himself out.\n\nOn a whim, he inserted the key into the lock and turned it.\n\n*Click…*\n\nThe lock opened.\n\nThe door hadn’t been changed,\n\nand the lock hadn’t been changed either?\n\nZhou Ze was surprised. He pushed the door open and flipped on the light.\n\nThe furniture in the living room was arranged just as it had been.\n\nZhou Ze even saw his own slippers. He changed into them and walked inside, the female corpse following him in.\n\n“Boss, is it still the same as before?” the female corpse asked.\n\n“Yes, and that’s what I find strangest.”\n\nIt was indeed just as it had been before.\n\nBut that defied common sense.\n\nAfter buying a house, wouldn't a normal person throw out all the things a dead person had used?\n\nHow could they possibly keep everything, perfectly preserved? Weren't they worried about the bad luck?\n\nPerhaps the person who took over his apartment was just an investor and didn't actually live here.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the sofa, as if in that moment, he had become himself again.\n\nEvery time he came home exhausted, he would watch some TV and cook a little late-night snack. His days were hectic, but fulfilling.\n\nThe female corpse went to boil some water, poured a cup for Zhou Ze, and then said,\n\n“Boss, you’ve been dead for over half a year, haven’t you?”\n\n“Seven months.”\n\nZhou Ze answered, but why did this conversation feel a little odd?\n\n“But this place is so clean. It doesn’t look like it’s been uninhabited for seven months,” the female corpse reminded him.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. It was true. The place was spotless; someone must be cleaning it regularly.\n\nBut Zhou Ze found it hard to imagine that the person who bought his apartment would be too lazy to throw anything out or change anything, even keeping the original lock.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door and found that even his comforter and bedsheets were the ones he used to use.\n\n“Boss, I’m going to take a shower. Being stared at by those old geezers in the Confucian Temple for so long gave me goosebumps.”\n\n“Go ahead. Turn on the water heater first,” Zhou Ze reminded her. “The bath towels are in the cabinet by the bathroom door.”\n\nIf,\n\neverything was truly arranged as it was before.\n\nThe female corpse went to shower. She was very fond of cleanliness. Women are naturally clean, and in her previous life, she was a lady from a prominent family. Lying in a coffin for two hundred years without being able to bathe must have been unbearable.\n\nSo she basically showered once in the morning and once at night, wasting a lot of Zhou Ze's water bill.\n\nBut when he thought about how she worked as a waitress in his shop without a salary, Zhou Ze just tolerated it.\n\nPulling back the curtains, Zhou Ze stood on the balcony, looking out at the shimmering lights of the night.\n\nThis,\n\nwas his home.\n\nIt hadn't changed,\n\nbut it no longer belonged to him.\n\nThe scenery was the same, but the people were gone.\n\nA classic case of things remaining while people have changed.\n\nHe took out a cigarette and lit it, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\nHe felt a sense of loss in his heart. He thought he would have been able to let it go, but in reality, he couldn't.\n\nJust as he had personally thrown that infant into hell to await reincarnation,\n\nhe now keenly realized,\n\nthat as a living person, his attachment to the mortal world was truly beyond words.\n\nEven now, he felt an impulse to buy his apartment back.\n\nAs for the money…\n\nwith his abilities, if he really wanted to break the rules to get some,\n\nwould it be difficult?\n\nThis impulse was suppressed with great effort. Zhou Ze knew this was a point of no return, a Pandora's box that, once opened, he would surely be unable to close.\n\nZhou Ze considered himself a self-disciplined person, but he also knew that whenever possible, one should never test the limits of human integrity.\n\n*Click…*\n\nUnexpectedly,\n\nthe sound of a key entering the lock came from the front door.\n\nThe owner was back?\n\nZhou Ze turned and walked from the balcony back into the living room. He was thinking about how to explain his presence in the apartment but wasn't overly nervous.\n\nWhen all was said and done, he was a ghost emissary. If he actually ended up getting arrested for trespassing and taken to the police station,\n\nwouldn't that be a great injustice to himself?\n\nSelf-discipline was one thing, but there was no need for self-torment.\n\nThis was, after all, his former home.\n\nHowever, when the door was pushed open,\n\nthe person who walked in,\n\nwas a familiar figure.\n\nDr. Lin stood in the doorway, looking at Zhou Ze in the living room. Shock and panic appeared on her face as she said,\n\n“You… what are you doing here?”\n\nZhou Ze was also at a loss for words for a moment.\n\nThe person who had bought his apartment,\n\nwas Dr. Lin?\n\n“Let me explain,” said Lin Wanquiu.\n\n“Let me explain,” said Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two spoke at the same time.\n\nLin Wanquiu was panicking because she thought Zhou Ze had discovered evidence of her \"emotional affair.\"\n\nHe had found this place. She was his wife, yet she had bought the apartment left behind by another man, and she had been cleaning and tidying it. For that man’s sake, she had refused to be intimate with her own husband.\n\nDr. Lin felt she was deeply in the wrong.\n\nFortunately, this awkward atmosphere didn't last long,\n\nbecause something even more awkward happened.\n\n“Boss, I accidentally got my clothes wet.”\n\nThe female corpse, wrapped in a single bath towel, walked out as she spoke.\n\nShe walked into…\n\nthe living room,\n\nand stood…\n\nbetween…\n\nZhou Ze and Lin Wanquiu.\n\n***\n\n¹A pun based on homophones. The words for rice cake (*gāo*) and *zongzi* (*zòng*) together sound like *gāo zhòng* (高中), which means “to pass an exam,” usually referring to the high school or university entrance exams.\n\n²A reference to the idiom “picking up sesame seeds but dropping the watermelon” (撿了芝麻丟了西瓜), which means focusing on a small gain while losing a big opportunity. By “picking up a watermelon,” it means he got a huge prize or a great deal.",

    "content": "What is feared most is the sudden silence...\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Dr. Lin lowered her head, also somewhat relieved.\n\nOne had an emotional affair,\n\nThe other, a \"physical affair.\"\n\nWhen one person makes a mistake, it's guilt.\n\nWhen two people make a mistake together, it's gender equality.\n\nZhou Ze laughed at this moment, a rather unrestrained laugh.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAfter his death, the person who bought his house was, surprisingly, his current \"wife.\"\n\nIndeed, Dr. Lin was wealthy. It was easy for her to buy a second-hand house in Tongcheng where the owner had died. And, it seemed, only she would clean this place while keeping its layout completely unchanged.\n\nTouched?\n\nOf course, he was touched.\n\nZhou Ze was Zhou Ze. Even though he was now in Xu Le's body, he still identified with his own perspective as Zhou Ze.\n\nXu Le was in the past. Regardless of whether that kid's love life had been rough or lacked dignity, Zhou Ze wasn't going to dwell on it.\n\nIt was like at a big New Year's Eve dinner, when some idiot suddenly pulls out their phone and says to everyone, \"Look at these refugees in parts of Africa, starving to skin and bones. How can you still eat your dinner?\"\n\nTo have such a woman, as if possessed, constantly remembering him, missing him…\n\nAs a man,\n\nHow could he not feel proud, not feel touched?\n\n\"Go find my clothes and change into them,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing at Bai Yingying.\n\nThe female corpse nodded and replied with an \"Oh.\" This time was different from the last; she didn't dare to follow her playful whims and deliberately add fuel to the fire. She obediently went to Zhou Ze's bedroom, found a set of his clean clothes, changed, and came out.\n\nDr. Lin still stood in the same spot, saying nothing.\n\nShe seemed to feel a sense of release, a sense of relief. However, Zhou Ze didn't let her continue with that emotion. Instead, he walked up, took Dr. Lin's hand, and said very seriously:\n\n\"There's something I have to tell you. Come with me.\"\n\nPulling Dr. Lin's hand, Zhou Ze led her out the door with a hint of forcefulness. They entered the elevator, with Bai Yingying following behind, not saying a word. She knew that anything she said now would be a mistake.\n\nOne could only say that this was all too much of a coincidence.\n\nDownstairs, Zhou Ze walked to Dr. Lin's Cayenne and gestured for her to give him the car keys.\n\nZhou Ze had decided. He was going to tell her his identity, regardless of whether she could accept it, regardless of whether she was like the fabled Lord Ye who loved dragons.¹\n\nIn short, Zhou Ze wanted to tell her the truth. He didn't want to be coy anymore, nor did he want to keep hiding. After all, times had changed. Back then, he was an unregistered person, but now, he was legitimized.\n\nThere was no reason to keep wronging himself.\n\n\"You don't have a driver's license,\" Dr. Lin reminded him.\n\n\"Give me the keys,\" Zhou Ze said forcefully, his tone leaving no room for argument.\n\nHe was going to take her to the hospital, to that familiar operating room, and use his actions to show her his true identity.\n\nOtherwise, he was worried that if he simply described it with words, she might think his \"pitiable husband's fantasy-prone personality\" was acting up.\n\nDr. Lin gave the car keys to Zhou Ze, and then all three of them got into the car.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the driver's seat, Dr. Lin in the passenger seat, and Bai Yingying sat quietly in the back.\n\nThe car started, reversed out…\n\nZhou Ze looked proficient and at ease.\n\nThat fool Xu Le didn't even have a license.\n\nHe, on the other hand, was a veteran driver.\n\nThen,\n\nA harsh scraping sound, \"Screeeeeeech...,\" was heard, and the car's body shuddered.\n\nZhou Ze fell silent.\n\nThe other two women in the car also fell silent.\n\nThe body of the Cayenne had scraped against a utility pole, grinding along its entire length.\n\nIn the dark night, it was as if a very diligent crow once again flew past overhead, perfectly on cue, letting out cries of \"Caw... caw... caw.\"\n\nThe air, once again, became extremely awkwardly quiet.\n\nZhou Ze unbuckled his seatbelt and said, \"You drive.\"\n\n\"To the People's Hospital?\"\n\nDr. Lin asked after switching seats.\n\n\"Yes, the People's Hospital.\" Sitting in the passenger seat, Zhou Ze covered his forehead with his hand, then gently tapped his head against the window.\n\nIt had been too long since he'd driven, and on top of that, he was in a different body. His driving skills had become far too rusty.\n\nBut no matter how many excuses there were,\n\nThat was just really embarrassing.\n\nThe car got on the road and soon entered the East Expressway overpass.\n\nIt was quiet inside the car. Dr. Lin didn't speak. Even though she didn't know why Zhou Ze wanted to go to the hospital, she didn't ask.\n\nTheir marital relationship right now…\n\nWas truly in tatters.\n\nBai Yingying sat in the back seat, looking at the scenery outside the window. It had been a long time since she had been able to come out. Although Madam Bai used to talk to her almost every day, she rarely had the chance to personally walk out and see the outside world.\n\nBesides, she knew this wasn't the right time for her to speak.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly sat up straight and said, \"Is that car driving on the wrong side of the road?\"\n\nOn the other side of the low concrete divider was the opposite lane of the overpass. A white sedan was there, but its front was facing the same direction as Zhou Ze's car.\n\nThis meant the other car was driving against traffic.\n\nAnd just at that moment,\n\nA large bus drove past in the adjacent lane, its high beams dazzlingly bright.\n\nImmediately following was the ear-piercing screech of emergency brakes.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously shut his eyes and covered his head with both hands. The bus was in the next lane and couldn't possibly hit him, but this scene was almost the most terrifying image in his memory.\n\nHe himself had been hit by a large truck just like this on his way home from work.\n\nEverything happening now triggered the most horrifying memory he was least willing to recall.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA dull impact sound was heard. Dr. Lin immediately stopped the car.\n\nIn the adjacent lane, the bus had collided with the white sedan that was driving against traffic. The small car was pushed forward, then its body was slammed hard against the concrete barrier by the front of the bus, completely deforming it.\n\nPutting on the hazard lights, Dr. Lin quickly got out of the car. Looking at her husband cowering and trembling in the passenger seat, a hint of disappointment appeared in her eyes. But she still immediately opened the trunk, took out the warning triangle to place behind the car, and then quickly climbed over the barrier to the other side.\n\nShe was a doctor; she needed to fulfill her duty. When an accident occurs, if there is professional medical help nearby, the victim's life has a very high probability of being saved.\n\n\"Boss?\" Bai Yingying called out from the back seat.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his hands and looked around, somewhat dazed. He saw the accident scene in the adjacent lane, where Dr. Lin had already rushed over.\n\n\"Come with me. We're saving people.\"\n\nZhou Ze got out of the car, his legs feeling a bit weak.\n\nThis was a person's self-preservation mechanism. When mental trauma is triggered, it often causes the body to react with a protective weakness.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze didn't hesitate for a moment. He too climbed over the barrier to help with the rescue.\n\nBai Yingying followed him over.\n\nThe bus driver also had blood on his face, likely from his head hitting the steering wheel or something else during the crash. Three other people got off the bus, probably passengers. All in all, the bus was very empty.\n\n\"Is he f*cking crazy? Driving the wrong way on an overpass! If you want to die, don't drag others down with you!\" the bus driver cursed, clutching the wound on his forehead.\n\nAnyone who encountered such rotten luck would be furious.\n\n\"Stop shouting and help!\" Dr. Lin barked at the bus driver.\n\nThe responsibility for the accident could be determined later. The priority now was to get the people out of the car.\n\n\"Hey, are you conscious? Can you answer me?\" Dr. Lin shouted at the people inside the deformed car.\n\nBut she received no response.\n\nThe bus driver, though grumbling, still joined the rescue. This road was already somewhat remote, a section of the overpass with very little traffic. The occasional car that passed by didn't stop to watch curiously; they just drove away.\n\n\"Pry the car door open!\" Zhou Ze suggested.\n\n\"We don't have any equipment, how can we pry it open?\" Dr. Lin's emotions were a bit frayed, especially when her husband, who didn't know any better, was giving useless commands. She grew even more irritated.\n\nThere were two people in the car, a woman and a child. Their situation was dire; both were covered in blood and completely unresponsive to her calls.\n\nThe car door had been smashed inward and was practically jammed shut. This would require the fire department to come with specialized equipment to cut it open.\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward and grabbed the car door. Bai Yingying came over at this moment. As a *jiangshi*,² her strength was naturally immense. She pulled along with Zhou Ze.\n\nWith a \"Crack!\" sound,\n\nThe car door was ripped right off. For good measure, Bai Yingying also pressed down the back of the car seat.\n\nDr. Lin stared, stunned.\n\nThe bus driver and the few passengers were also stunned.\n\n*They must have gotten lucky, it was probably just lightly jammed.*\n\nZhou Ze bent down, one hand supporting the victim's neck and the other holding her legs, and carefully dragged the woman out first. Then, he went back to pull out the boy's body.\n\nDr. Lin first checked the woman's body, her expression grave. When the boy was pulled out, she checked his body as well, and her expression immediately turned somber.\n\nDead.\n\nThey were both dead.\n\n\"Dead?\" the bus driver asked in disbelief, his face turning pale. He had really run into some rotten luck. \"These bastards, coming out to harm people in the middle of the night! They've completely ruined me!\"\n\n\"Call the police and 120,\"³ Dr. Lin's phone was still in the car, so she yelled at the bus driver.\n\nAlthough the bus driver was furious, he still took out his phone and started making the calls.\n\nZhou Ze, however, turned the bodies of the woman and the boy over. Seeing this, Dr. Lin was a bit puzzled.\n\n\"When I was pulling them out, I did a quick check. They have many external injuries, all from the car crash.\n\n\"But they have one thing in common. At the back of their heads, they both have a depressed skull fracture. If I'm not mistaken, that should be the fatal wound.\n\n\"I think it might have been caused by a hammer wrapped in cotton cloth.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Dr. Lin immediately followed up, checking the wound in that location. She instantly understood. \"They were already dead before the crash!\"\n\nYes, otherwise it would be very difficult to explain how both of them suffered the same fatal injury in the exact same spot. It was too much of a coincidence—a coincidence so unlikely it was virtually impossible.\n\n\"Dead people, arranged in a car, then driven against traffic.\" Zhou Ze looked at Dr. Lin with a smile. \"Then disguised as a car crash. A pretty good 'accident'.\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze turned his head and looked at the bus driver behind them, who was on the phone reporting the incident. The few \"passengers\" from the bus, who had been standing around, also began to slowly surround them.\n\nThe bus driver also looked at Zhou Ze, a meaningful smile appearing on his face as he spoke into the phone:\n\n\"Boss, our luck's a bit rotten. We've run into a few nosy, unlucky devils.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Lord Ye who loved dragons (葉公好龍, Yè Gōng hào lóng):** A famous Chinese idiom about someone who professes to love something but is actually terrified of it when faced with the real thing.\n2.  ***Jiangshi* (殭屍):** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n3.  **120:** The emergency medical services phone number in China, equivalent to 911 in the US or 999 in the UK for medical emergencies.",

    "content": "As a surgeon, Zhou Ze could easily spot the abnormalities in the corpse's death, which meant that the forensic pathologists, whose job this actually was, could obviously discover them too.\n\nTherefore, in Zhou Ze's view, the staging of this car accident was actually a failure. It was merely \"all form and no substance,\" unable to stand up to any scrutiny.\n\nHe didn't know if this group had other tricks up their sleeves or methods to perfectly patch this case up into an accident, or if this group was really just a bunch of \"newbies.\"\n\nOf course, now was not the time to ponder this question, because this group didn't seem to intend to waste any more time talking.\n\n\"Get them, and take their car.\"\n\nThe bus driver glanced at the time; it was precious right now.\n\nA few of his men lunged forward. To them, a skinny man and two young women couldn't possibly make any waves.\n\nBai Yingying tilted her head and looked at Zhou Ze, waiting for his command.\n\nDr. Lin stood her ground. It was clear she was very nervous, but she didn't scream or shout. To be able to do that was already quite something.\n\nFaced with this situation, most people, even those who usually boasted of being braver than the heavens, would probably find it quite normal to be so scared they'd fall to their knees, begging for mercy and yelling, \"I didn't see anything!\"\n\n\"No killing,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Haha,\" the bus driver chuckled upon hearing this.\n\nUnfortunately for him, Zhou Ze wasn't talking to him.\n\nBai Yingying responded with a \"You got it!\" and charged straight ahead.\n\nZhou Ze took a step back, grabbed Dr. Lin's hand, and said, \"It's okay. I'm here.\"\n\nBai Yingying, charging at the front, nearly stumbled.\n\n*I'm* up here charging into battle, and you have the leisure to be all lovey-dovey back there?\n\nThe other woman... oh wait, a maid has her dignity too, you know!\n\nDr. Lin bit her lip and said self-reproachfully, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe was the one who had stopped the car to save someone, leading them all into this crisis, so she apologized.\n\n\"It's to be expected. A professional compulsion,\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile. The last time at the movie theater, he had rushed in just like this. All he could say was that some professional habits were truly impossible to break.\n\nThe female corpse had just been force-fed a mouthful of dog food,¹ so she unconsciously struck a little harder.\n\n\"Come here, little wench. Let big brother dote on you.\"\n\nA man opened his arms, preparing to grab the high school girl.\n\nThe boss had told them not to kill anyone here but to take them away instead, as they couldn't afford to drag things out at this location.\n\nHowever, his arms embraced empty air.\n\nIn the next moment, his left arm was seized by the female corpse.\n\n\"CRACK...\"\n\n\"CRACK...\"\n\n\"CRACK...\"\n\nDr. Lin shuddered at the sound, and even Zhou Ze found it a bit grating.\n\nHe even thought that if Bugles² recorded their sound effects here for a commercial, it would probably sound even better than their current one.\n\nSo satisfyingly crispy.\n\nThe man's mouth hung open; he couldn't even scream in pain. The female corpse took another step forward and kicked the man's calf.\n\n\"CRUNCH... CRUNCH... CRUNCH...\"\n\nAnother three crisp snaps.\n\nPringles could also use this sound for a commercial, Zhou Ze thought.\n\n\"I... fuck...\"\n\nThe man crumpled to the ground, one arm completely disabled, the other leg completely broken. He looked like a toad, lying on the ground, able to do nothing but wail and squirm.\n\nZhou Ze felt not a shred of pity. He forbade the female corpse from killing because matters of the living world could only be handed over to the police to handle. He trusted that the country's judicial system would leave no evil unexposed.\n\nBut the people before him were, after all, cold-blooded murderers who had been about to make a move on him. Zhou Ze didn't have a bleeding-heart complex big enough to feel that treating them this way was pitiful.\n\nWho knew what they had just been planning to do to the three of them?\n\nIf he were still the doctor from his past life, and the female corpse was just a high school girl, then who would have pitied them?\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\n\"CLANG!\"\n\n\"SMACK!\"\n\nThe other two men were taken down directly, in the same fashion, with broken bones. While not fatal, they were incapacitated.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's professional perspective, even if these three on the ground were treated at a hospital, they would likely be unable to care for themselves for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe bus driver's phone fell and clattered to the ground.\n\nHe subconsciously swallowed a mouthful of saliva.\n\nEverything before him felt so unreal.\n\nHe hadn't brought a gun, because the original plan involved facing interrogation and investigation by traffic police and law enforcement, so of course, he couldn't carry any contraband.\n\nHe had thought that even with the addition of these \"good Samaritans\" like Zhou Ze, the situation wouldn't spiral too far out of control.\n\nEven if it did, he believed he could still manage it.\n\nHowever, the problem now was quite severe, because this girl was walking toward him.\n\n\"I...\" The bus driver, whose acting had been superb just moments ago, was now at a loss for words.\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nThe female corpse reached out, flipped the bus driver onto the ground, and planted a foot on his neck.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\nZhou Ze called out.\n\nThe female corpse stopped, not asking why.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, squatted down, and patted the bus driver's bearded cheek.\n\nThen, feeling his action was a bit pointless, he wiped his hand on the female corpse's pant leg.\n\nThis guy's face was so greasy.\n\n\"...\" The female corpse.\n\n\"Are there any others in your group?\"\n\nWhat Zhou Ze had to consider now was how to eliminate all future trouble. He himself wasn't afraid of anything, but this matter couldn't be covered up. What if they took care of the small fries, but the big boss got away and decided to target Dr. Lin for revenge?\n\nThere's no sense in guarding against a thief for a thousand days.\n\nPreviously, the little loli had said that in Rongcheng, there was another of his kind who had overstepped his bounds and started acting as a judge. Zhou Ze certainly couldn't follow in his footsteps.\n\nAlthough emotionally, Zhou Ze truly admired him, thinking he was awesome and had big dreams.\n\nBut this matter had already affected his daily life; he had to personally see it to its conclusion.\n\nThe female corpse smashed her fist down on the bus driver's left arm.\n\n\"CRUNCH...\"\n\n\"AHHHH!!! No more, no more... It's just us few, we all met working temp jobs... It's just us, we were hired by an employer.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, then looked at the female corpse and said, \"Is there a way to make them forget this?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't want trouble, and he certainly didn't want to be on the news.\n\nThe female corpse made a throat-slitting gesture.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. No killing. At least, not by his hand.\n\n\"Alternatively, Boss, you can prick them with your fingernail. It'll confuse their minds for a while, like they're drunk, and then they'll black out.\"\n\n\"How much should I prick them?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Just a tiny bit, otherwise they might actually die. Also, I know you don't want trouble, Boss. When you get back, burn all your remaining paper money, and trouble won't come knocking. But I guess you also won't have people tossing money at your storefront anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced up at Dr. Lin in the distance, then silently walked over to each of the thugs lying on the ground. He discreetly pricked each one with the black nail on his little finger. The men all trembled violently, foamed at the mouth, and quickly fell unconscious.\n\nBut none were in mortal danger.\n\nLooking around, there shouldn't be any cameras here, otherwise they wouldn't have chosen this spot to stage an accident. Zhou Ze picked up one of their phones, dialed the police, and then tossed the phone away.\n\nAfter all this was done, Zhou Ze waved to Dr. Lin and got back into her car.\n\nDr. Lin also got into the driver's seat.\n\n\"Let's go. Don't stop here,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Okay.\" Dr. Lin took a deep breath and started the car.\n\n\"Don't tell anyone about this.\"\n\nZhou Ze reminded her as the car was moving.\n\n\"Why?\" Dr. Lin clearly didn't understand.\n\nZhou Ze pointed behind them.\n\n\"She's a successor of Tai Chi Baguazhang. She had to flee to my place because she accidentally crippled someone while sparring. She's the one who saved me just now, so our identities can't be exposed, or she'll be taken away by the police.\"\n\nThe female corpse, sitting in the back, rolled her eyes.\n\n*That story? You might as well be trying to fool a ghost.*\n\nDr. Lin remained silent, and it was unclear if she actually believed him. She just continued to drive quietly.\n\nThe car was still heading toward the People's Hospital. For Dr. Lin, even if Zhou Ze hadn't initially said they were going there, she would have subconsciously driven there anyway. After all, it was her workplace, a place where she could feel a sense of security.\n\nThe car entered the People's Hospital parking lot, and all three got out.\n\nDr. Lin didn't ask Zhou Ze where he was going; it didn't occur to her that the place he wanted to go was actually the emergency room. She just walked forward in silence.\n\nThe female corpse leaned in close to Zhou Ze's ear and said, \"Are you still going to confess tonight?\"\n\nShe was very smart. From details like Lin Wanqiu buying Zhou Ze's former house, she had already inferred much of the inside story.\n\n\"This isn't a Qiong Yao drama,³ why would I make it so melodramatic?\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nAlthough the little incident on the road had left Dr. Lin still a bit shaken, Zhou Ze had no intention of abandoning his original plan.\n\nA woman like this, who was also the legal wife of his current body...\n\n...not telling her the truth so she could sleep with him at night with a clear conscience...\n\n...had his brain flooded with water?⁴\n\nHiding things back and forth, with twists and turns, moving and tragic, and then descending into hysteria—that was the kind of trope Auntie Qiong Yao liked. He, Zhou Ze, did not.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on a bench near the parking lot exit, and Zhou Ze sat down beside her.\n\nThe female corpse tactfully kept her distance.\n\nThe two of them sat next to each other.\n\nLin Wanqiu took a deep breath. Her beautiful face looked even more exquisite in the moonlight.\n\nZhou Ze admired her from the side.\n\nTo have such a beautiful woman, and such a good-looking... wife,\n\nstill missing him, who had been dead for over half a year...\n\nThe sense of accomplishment was truly overwhelming.\n\n\"About what just happened... is it really going to be okay?\" Dr. Lin had clearly not fully recovered from the incident.\n\n\"We didn't do anything wrong, right?\" Zhou Ze comforted her.\n\nDr. Lin nodded.\n\n\"It's like those very brave anti-drug police officers. They also conceal their identities, and their families do too. It's to ensure their safety. It's a great sacrifice they make.\"\n\n\"So, you're afraid of retaliation?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand.\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, preparing to pull the woman into an embrace, and then it would be the \"moment to witness a miracle.\" But Dr. Lin spoke first:\n\n\"What exactly is the relationship between you and her?\n\n\"Xu Le, please answer me seriously. This time, no matter what you answer, I'll believe you,\" Dr. Lin said, looking at Zhou Ze. \"And I'll forgive you, too.\"\n\n\"There's really nothing between us,\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile. All he could say was that both times had been too coincidental.\n\nDr. Lin fell silent again. Just as Zhou Ze was about to speak, Dr. Lin took the initiative to grab his hand. Zhou Ze was taken aback for a moment.\n\n\"Xu Le, I'm sorry. I've always been in love with another man. You must have already discovered that, otherwise you wouldn't have shown up at that house.\n\n\"Although nothing ever happened between me and that man, I admit that I had an emotional affair. I'm sorry, because you are my husband in name.\"\n\n\"It's okay...\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to speak, Dr. Lin spoke again:\n\n\"I've thought things through about us.\n\n\"I'll give you two choices.\n\n\"One, we get a divorce. I will personally compensate you with one million yuan, and the bookstore will also be yours.\"\n\n\"What's this about a divorce,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Two, I will try my best to forget that man. I will earnestly choose to build a life with you, to be your... real wife, to make up for how I've wronged you in the past.\n\n\"Xu Le, I am willing to try... to give you my all, to fulfill my duties and responsibilities as a wife.\"\n\nAs she said these words, Dr. Lin's eyes reddened. She had resigned herself to her fate.\n\n\"Okay... Hey, wait a minute.\"\n\nZhou Ze's mind couldn't quite process it. The relationships were a bit of a mess; he had to sort them out first. Then, Zhou Ze finally understood the details and was so angry he immediately stood up, pointed at Dr. Lin, and blurted out without thinking:\n\n\"No!\n\n\"You have to keep having the affair!\"\n\n\"...\" Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Pfft...\" In the distance, the female corpse, who had been pretending to look at the scenery while actually eavesdropping on the gossip with her superhuman hearing, burst out laughing.\n\nThen she clutched her stomach and squatted down.\n\n\"Hahahaha, I'm laughing so hard my tummy hurts!\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Dog food (狗糧):** Chinese internet slang for public displays of affection (PDA).

    "content": "\"No, you have to continue the affair!\"\n\n\"...\" Dr. Lin.\n\nDr. Lin's red lips parted slightly. She was at a loss, and also a little baffled.\n\nHad her \"husband\" not forgiven her yet?\n\nOr perhaps, her \"husband\" had some kind of cuckolding fetish?\n\nWeighed down by guilt and pressure, Dr. Lin had chosen to compromise. In truth, of the two conditions she had offered, anyone who wasn't a fool or incredibly naive would certainly choose the second.\n\nThe first was to take a million yuan plus a bookstore operating at a loss.\n\nThe second was to get her and her money together. Once you had her, would a million yuan even be an issue?\n\nBesides, she wasn't some ugly, rich old woman.\n\nHowever, for Zhou Ze, the situation he faced was a bit more difficult.\n\n*I've been working my ass off all day, and now you're telling me you're going to forget me and resign yourself to a peaceful life with that little bastard Xu Le?*\n\nZhou Ze could not allow this to happen.\n\nOriginally, he was the one cuckolding someone else, and it felt great.\n\nA sense of accomplishment, *pew pew pew*.\n\nNow that he was the one being cuckolded, it wasn't so wonderful.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, pointed to his own face, and said very seriously,\n\n\"I'm not Xu Le. I'm Zhou Ze.\"\n\nDr. Lin froze.\n\nThe two of them were silent for a long time.\n\nFinally, Dr. Lin sighed and said,\n\n\"No matter which option you choose, I admit that I've wronged you. But you shouldn't tease me like this. Or... is it that you're still resentful?\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged. \"I really am Zhou Ze. I died in a car crash, but when I woke up, for some reason, I had transmigrated into this guy's body. I don't know if you read novels or watch TV shows, but this kind of transmigration trope shouldn't be that rare.\"\n\n\"Whatever... you say,\" Dr. Lin placated.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that the woman before him was probably planning to contact a psychologist for him tomorrow. If she were a bit more ruthless, she might even have him forcibly committed to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn the distance, the sound of a 120 ambulance siren could be heard, and the hospital building suddenly burst into a commotion.\n\n\"I'll go take a look.\" Dr. Lin stood up, intending to temporarily abandon the conversation with her \"husband.\" In her eyes, her \"husband\" had suffered a significant mental shock.\n\nBut because of this, she felt even more guilt toward Xu Le.\n\nAfter seeing Lin Wanqiu leave, the female corpse who had been eavesdropping on the gossip came up behind Zhou Ze and said,\n\n\"Boss, why don't you let her see your fungal nail?\"\n\n\"Or let her see if you're cold?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nThe female corpse pouted and said, \"I guess that could work. If she stuck her hand in to feel, she'd understand.\"\n\n\"I want to be a bit more elegant about it,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Keep it as gentle as possible.\"\n\n\"So pretentious,\" the female corpse dared to mock her boss.\n\n\"Right, so pretentious. Weren't you also being pretentious back when you, a high-born lady, were having secret trysts with a sour scholar?\" Zhou Ze stretched. \"Come on, follow me inside.\"\n\n\"To the hospital?\"\n\n\"Nonsense. With such a huge commotion over there, it must be a major accident. There are definitely a lot of injured people, and the attending ER physicians are bound to be short-staffed. The medical interns don't have enough experience or courage to handle this situation.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze walked into the hospital with the female corpse, then turned directly into the staff changing room.\n\n\"But Boss, what does this have to do with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze picked out a white coat that was roughly his size and put it on, then tied on a mask.\n\n\"I was a doctor in my past life. Dr. Lin was my intern back then.\"\n\n\"Hehe, a teacher-student romance.\" The female corpse changed into a white coat as well, her voice tinged with excitement. \"So, Boss, what should I do?\"\n\n\"Pick some BGM¹ for me,\" Zhou Ze said, pulling on his gloves.\n\n\"BGM?\" The female corpse was taken aback.\n\n\"Because I'm about to show off.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\n*A familiar feeling.*\n\n*I'm back.*\n\n...\n\n\"Doctors nowadays are so different from the doctors in my time,\" the female corpse said, feeling a bit awkward in her nurse's dress.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze replied noncommittally.\n\n\"It's all made me a bit dazed,\" the female corpse lamented. \"I feel like I'm a little out of touch with this world. It seems I'll have to get out more in the future,\" she said tentatively.\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous. You even know what 'Wanchai Ferry'² means, and you have the nerve to say you're out of touch?\" Zhou Ze quickly shot back.\n\nThe female corpse stuck out her tongue. \"Boss, what kind of doctor were you before? I hear being an OB-GYN is pretty good.\"\n\n\"You read novels in your coffin too?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"What?\" The female corpse was a bit confused.\n\n\"Golden ophthalmology, silver surgery, dirty and tiring work in obstetrics and gynecology.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Only outsiders or people influenced by certain literary works would think being an OB-GYN is wonderful and pleasant.\"\n\nJust then, the elevator opened, and a gurney was pushed over by several orderlies.\n\nZhou Ze immediately walked over and asked, \"What happened?\"\n\nThe medical intern instinctively answered as if to his \"mentor,\" \"Patient has lost consciousness.\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened. He immediately flipped onto the gurney, straddling the patient, and began performing CPR compressions while shouting,\n\n\"Quick, push him to the resuscitation room!\"\n\nAt that moment, several orderlies and nurses pushed the gurney forward together. The many patients and family members in the hallway could only hurry to make way.\n\n\"Clear the way!\" Zhou Ze yelled.\n\nDr. Lin, who had just finished treating an injured person's wound, wiped the sweat from her brow and walked out. Seeing the figure kneeling on the gurney performing CPR, she froze for a moment.\n\nThen she immediately ran toward them.\n\n*What on earth is he doing?*\n\n*This is a hospital!*\n\nUpon reaching the resuscitation room, Zhou Ze directly ordered, \"Get the crash cart, prepare for endotracheal intubation!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the intern responded. Seeing the intern comply, the surrounding nurses naturally followed the command.\n\nThey each assumed that the others knew this new doctor. In reality, it was a massive misunderstanding. Of course, this was also because the situation was urgent, and Zhou Ze's tone and command truly did not give the impression of a \"fake doctor.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood at the head of the patient's bed, performing the intubation himself.\n\nAt the same time, he held his left hand out flat. \"Stylet.\"\n\n\"Here.\" A female nurse immediately handed the instrument to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze then said to the intern beside him, \"Check the position.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The intern, who had been a bit nervous before, was no longer tense. Many young doctors are like this: their technical skills are solid, but they aren't suited to take the lead on their own. They are better suited to being a workhorse under someone else's command.\n\nHe put on his stethoscope, listened for the position, then nodded at Zhou Ze. \"Position is good.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Switch out, keep compressing.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nAnother nurse from the side immediately came over and took over CPR from the previous one.\n\nAt this moment, a nurse looked at the monitor beside them and exclaimed, \"Patient's in V-fib!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up. \"Prepare to defibrillate.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nThe intern immediately took out scissors and cut open the patient's clothes. Zhou Ze took over from the previous nurse and began performing CPR himself, simultaneously saying,\n\n\"Charge to two hundred joules.\"\n\n\"Understood.\" The female nurse prepared everything at once, then said, \"Charged.\"\n\nAt that moment, Dr. Lin pushed aside the curtain and walked in, seeing the figure organizing the rescue.\n\n*That's right, it's Xu Le. It's my husband.*\n\nDr. Lin pointed a finger at Zhou Ze. She was furious. She didn't know what was wrong with her husband. He had just told her he was Zhou Ze, and she thought he might be suffering from hysteria, but she would absolutely not allow him to joke with a patient's life!\n\n\"Preparing to shock. Clear!\" Zhou Ze warned everyone around him, then fixed his gaze pointedly on Dr. Lin.\n\nDr. Lin's body trembled. A familiar feeling washed over her entire body.\n\nA familiar scene.\n\nA familiar tone of voice.\n\nA familiar style.\n\nAt this moment, she couldn't even speak.\n\nAfter the first defibrillation, Zhou Ze continued CPR, his eyes fixed on the monitor.\n\nBut the situation didn't improve. Zhou Ze said directly, \"Again, charge to two hundred joules!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The female nurse prepared again, then announced, \"Charged.\"\n\n\"Clear.\"\n\nZhou Ze administered the defibrillation once more.\n\nUnder the electric shock, the patient's entire body convulsed.\n\nThe intern beside him continued CPR.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the monitor; it finally showed a normal rhythm.\n\n\"Rhythm restored. Run an EKG,\" Zhou Ze said to the intern beside him.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe intern immediately went to prepare it, then handed the EKG report paper to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took it, glanced at it, and said, \"Acute myocardial infarction. Contact cardiology, prepare for an emergency PCI immediately.\"\n\n\"Okay, understood.\" The intern wiped his sweat, letting out a long sigh of relief.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze also walked out of the resuscitation room.\n\nDr. Lin was standing right outside. The look she gave him was filled with doubt, disbelief, excitement, and, at the same time, fear.\n\nZhou Ze berated her directly,\n\n\"What are you standing there gawking for? There are patients everywhere, go save them!\n\nIf you want to cry or be scared, wait until you're off work, go home, and cry into a doll in bed.\"\n\nDr. Lin immediately burst into tears.\n\nBack then, he...\n\n...had scolded her in the exact same way.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nDr. Lin rushed forward, threw her arms around Zhou Ze, and pressed her face directly against his chest.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nHe had imagined many of Dr. Lin's possible reactions after he revealed the truth.\n\nFear?\n\nA breakdown?\n\nTerror?\n\nBut he had never anticipated this scene.\n\n*Holy crap.*\n\n*She's throwing herself into my arms already?*\n\n*It's already OK?*\n\nZhou Ze had always been curious how he, such a clueless and unromantic person back then, had managed to capture the heart of Dr. Lin, who had been a sweet young thing at the time.\n\nNow, he thought he understood a little.\n\n*Could it be that Dr. Lin has Stockholm syndrome?*\n\n*The more I scolded her, the more I berated her, the more she fell for me?*\n\n*However, it seems that women with this kind of syndrome might also be receptive to certain... bedroom... kinks... that ordinary people would find hard to accept?*\n\n*Hehe.*\n\n---\n¹ BGM: Background Music.\n² Wanchai Ferry: A popular brand of frozen dumplings in China.

    "content": "The evening sun was like a bright red apple, or like a little girl's cheek, roasted ruddy.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the bookstore, sorting through the latest batch of bills. The bookstore's operations were now financially strained; the key problem was that the inheritance he had received from Xu Le was far too small.\n\nIf not for reclaiming a share from the bootleg booksellers that one time, the shop probably wouldn't have been able to stay afloat.\n\nAfter returning from the hospital that night, Zhou Ze had burned all the remaining spirit money. He had even squatted by the door, smoked half a pack of cigarettes, and waited for a good while. Sure enough, no one came to toss him money anymore.\n\nAccording to the female corpse, this was called \"using underworld merit to ward off disaster.\"\n\nThe spirit money given by ghosts was equivalent to underworld merit. When you needed money, you could use it to \"exchange\" for cash; when you needed to avoid danger, you could use it to offset trouble.\n\nThe last incident had been reported in the news: a rich man had hired someone to murder his wife.\n\nThere was a rumor that the suspect claimed a high school girl had shown up and beaten them up, but of course, no one would believe that.\n\nIt's not like she was a Sailor Moon.\n\nIn any case, that matter was considered closed, and Zhou Ze hadn't burned his spirit money for nothing.\n\nXu Qinglang came over from next door, holding two cups of tea. His lifestyle was getting more and more refined.\n\nOriginally a diligent and promising young man,\n\nafter coming into possession of over twenty properties,\n\nhe had finally begun to indulge in pleasure, falling into a rhythm of decadence.\n\nThe two sat by the counter, drinking tea together.\n\n\"So, what ended up happening with that wife of yours?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"She said she needs some time alone, and some time to think,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe confession process had been very smooth,\n\nso smooth it was almost unsettling.\n\nDr. Lin's affection for him was even trending toward the \"pathological,\" but thankfully, she was still a rational person.\n\nXu Le was dead, and he, Zhou Ze, had borrowed his corpse to resurrect his soul. With all sorts of unbelievable things happening right in front of her, asking her to accept it all at once and continue living a blissful, shameless life with her \"dream lover\" slash \"current husband,\"\n\nwas a bit much.\n\n\"That's not bad. She's stronger than I imagined.\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"An ordinary person would probably have been scared out of their mind.\"\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal.\n\nXu Qinglang shouldn't have known about this. It was obvious someone had leaked it.\n\nHe didn't need to look to know who the leaker was.\n\nThat Ms. Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Right, I have something to ask you.\" Zhou Ze asked very seriously, \"When Xu Le was running the shop, was he this hard-up?\"\n\n\"No way. I think he lived quite freely. But I didn't interact with him much before he died. A very dull guy, boring as hell.\n\n\"But he should have had a lot of money. I remember back then he was often helping out his relatives in the bookstore, and he was very generous with his money.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Xu Qinglang glanced at Zhou Ze again, even sticking his tongue out to lick his lips.\n\n\"You're much more interesting.\"\n\nFor a moment, his waist swayed, his eyes flirtatious as rippling water, truly making one's heart flutter.\n\n\"It's a real shame you didn't become a gigolo. You could have been the king of them all.\"\n\n\"Can we not have a normal conversation?\" Xu Qinglang said, annoyed.\n\n\"It's a compliment.\"\n\n\"Hah...\" Xu Qinglang pointed a finger at Zhou Ze. \"You should be more concerned about yourself.\"\n\n\"Concerned about what?\" Zhou Ze gestured around the bookstore. \"Business has been slow lately. Never mind not running into many living people, I haven't even seen many ghosts.\"\n\n\"You and your doctor wife, what are your plans? I think she just needs a buffer period, and then she'll come to accept it.\n\n\"After all, a woman like her... honestly, you've struck gold. Who knew that in this day and age you could still find a well-bred lady from an ancient noble family? Her parents must be oddballs too.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Zhou Ze nodded. His father-in-law and mother-in-law were indeed very odd.\n\nHis father-in-law had been a hospital director and had run his own medical company. Logically, he should be an absolute success, but in some respects, he appeared very feudal and stubborn.\n\n\"A woman like that, once you've tamed her, she'll willingly support you as a husband and raise your children.\" A look of longing appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. \"I want a woman like that too.\"\n\n\"You already are one,\" Zhou Ze shot back.\n\n\"Let's get back to your problem. You're going to live with her in the future, right?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then you'll definitely sleep together, right?\" Xu Qinglang held out a hand, wiggling his fingers, and continued, \"The 'sleep' I'm talking about is a verb that includes many complex actions and special positions, you get me?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, still not knowing what Xu Qinglang was getting at.\n\n\"Okay, then, here's your problem. You're using Xu Le's body right now. If you two really sleep together, doesn't that also mean Xu Le cuckolded you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang narrowed his eyes, a mischievous grin on his face.\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze sank into deep thought.\n\n\"Furthermore, your DNA isn't your original DNA, but Xu Le's. Which means, after you two go through the extremely complex and rich process of the verb 'to sleep,' the child that's born...\n\n\"isn't actually your child, but the child of Xu Le and Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"Right?\"\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze once again sank into deep thought.\n\nThe more Xu Qinglang spoke, the more excited he got. Seeing Zhou Ze's continued silence, he felt an indescribable sense of glee!\n\nBack when Madam Bai had her people carry an eight-bearer sedan chair over to pick him up,\n\nit was Zhou Ze who had secretly pointed a finger at him.\n\nHe had recorded that grudge in his little black book!\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of water, his expression unchanged.\n\n\"Feeling worried? Feeling lost?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I'm the one who gets the pleasure,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned and continued, \"But this body is Xu Le's. When you sleep with her, it's Xu Le's body.\"\n\n\"I'm the one who gets the pleasure.\"\n\n\"But the child's DNA...\"\n\n\"I'm the one who gets the pleasure.\"\n\nXu Qinglang slammed both hands on the counter and snapped,\n\n\"Holy shit, you can't be this open-minded about it!\"\n\n\"In any case, I'm the one who gets the pleasure. That guy Xu Le went to hell long ago, who knows where he is now. He's probably already drunk Granny Meng's soup and been reincarnated. Why should I care about this?\n\n\"As long as I'm the one enjoying it, that's all that matters.\"\n\nXu Qinglang's chest heaved with anger. He didn't know why he was so angry,\n\nbut he just was!\n\n\"Alright, let's drop it. If we keep going, this will turn into a debate about spirit versus flesh, almost reaching philosophical heights.\" Zhou Ze signaled an end to the somewhat boring discussion.\n\n\"Whatever makes you happy,\" Xu Qinglang said, full of resentment.\n\n\"Right, there's something I need to ask you,\" Zhou Ze said, thinking of something else.\n\n\"Spit it out.\"\n\n\"Do you know any other ghost emissaries?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I was living with the souls of my parents. You think I'd dare to go get acquainted with ghost emissaries?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n\"Alright, I get it.\"\n\nLooks like he'd have to find time to visit the Temple of Confucius. The dwarf-like old man he'd seen last time, the one beating the gong, should also be on the official payroll.\n\n\"What is it you really want to ask?\" Xu Qinglang inquired.\n\n\"I want to ask if ghost emissaries have things like performance reports—stuff for promotions, raises, and benefits.\"\n\n\"They... probably do.\" Xu Qinglang pondered for a moment. \"Look at Madam Bai. She was able to accumulate merit and go from a female ghost lingering in the mortal world to returning to Hell to seek an official post. You should have something similar.\n\n\"That little loli didn't tell you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"I also think you became a ghost emissary a bit too easily. My guess is, she probably has some other serious matter to deal with, so she temporarily dumped this duty on you to handle.\"\n\n\"You mean, I'm really just a temp?\"\n\n\"Heh heh, once she's done with her business, you'll probably have to clear out. If she's in a good mood, she'll turn a blind eye. If she's in a bad mood, it's entirely possible she'll drag you straight back to Hell.\"\n\n\"What kind of business does she have to deal with?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nImmediately, the image of the young man drinking congee from the old Daoist's livestream appeared in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nRongcheng,\n\nThe Underworld Shop?\n\nConnecting that with the little loli's reaction when he mentioned Rongcheng,\n\nit seemed,\n\nit was truly possible.\n\nBut no matter what, he couldn't easily give back his temporary position. Life as an unregistered entity wasn't pleasant.\n\nXu Qinglang went back to his own shop, saying \"Happy Lantern Festival\" to Zhou Ze as he left.\n\nZhou Ze was also packing up, simultaneously instructing Bai Yingying to go out and buy him a few cartons of cigarettes and some sweet glutinous rice balls. He had to change his plans and go to the Temple of Confucius tonight to chat with the dwarf-like old man.\n\nJust then, the bookstore door was pushed open, and a man in a white down jacket walked in.\n\n\"Brother Ah Le! I came to pick up my dad from the hospital.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused for a moment, his mind working. He roughly guessed the man's identity. It should be his eldest paternal uncle's son, a bit younger than him, making him Xu Le's paternal cousin.\n\nXu Dachuan had come to the city to see him last time and had gotten into a car accident on his way back, suffering a minor fracture. Zhou Ze had visited him once afterward. Dr. Lin had paid for all the medical expenses, so he hadn't concerned himself with it further.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze responded, somewhat coldly.\n\n\"Brother Ah Le, I'm a bit short on spending money lately. You see, after my dad's fall, he'll have to rest and recuperate at home for at least two months, so he can't go out to work and earn money.\"\n\nThe cousin smiled at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I already gave your uncle money for recuperation,\" Zhou Ze said. He had given some, but Xu Dachuan had refused to take it. Zhou Ze had to secretly stuff it into his clothes.\n\n\"Hey, Brother Ah Le, I started dating a new girlfriend recently, and I'm a bit tight on cash. Brother, help your little brother out, huh?\" The cousin was now asking directly.\n\n\"Business here... isn't good either.\" Zhou Ze had no intention of giving him money.\n\n\"Brother, that's not cool of you.\" The cousin was unhappy. \"I was the one who found someone to help you with that thing last time.\"\n\n\"What thing?\"\n\n\"Brother, you're being unfair. Forgetting about it after it's done? Let me tell you, I'm not shamelessly asking you for money. Look, have I come to you for money at all in the last six months?\n\n\"About that thing last time, the driver guaranteed he won't let it slip. Besides, he's been locked up for half a year already. After another half a year or so, he'll be out. He'd have to be an idiot to spill the beans, right? He'll definitely keep his mouth shut, otherwise, it'll go from reckless driving to intentional homicide.\n\n\"Little brother is really tight on cash this time. Brother, just lend me a thousand or two. I'll pay you back when I have money, okay?\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the teacup on the counter. Hearing this, he suddenly frowned slightly and said,\n\n\"What are you talking about? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Brother, are you planning to burn the bridge now that you've crossed it?\n\n\"Six months ago, you were the one who asked me to help you contact a truck driver and pay him to deliberately run over and kill that doctor.\n\n\"You can't forget my contribution...\"\n\n*Crack...*\n\nThe glass in Zhou Ze's hand\n\nwas crushed to pieces.",

    "content": "\"Brother Le?\" The cousin watched as Zhou Ze simply crushed the glass in his hand, watched as blood dripped ceaselessly from his palm, and was so frightened that he subconsciously took several steps back.\n\n\"Brother Le, if you're short on cash, then let's just forget it, really, just forget it.\" The cousin was clearly scared, and his voice held a hint of tears as he spoke.\n\nThey were like grasshoppers tied to the same rope; it wasn't a matter of who was threatening whom. Of course, his initial plan was simply to lean on this favor to squeeze a bit more spending money out of him.\n\nBut if he pushed his cousin too far...\n\nYes, his cousin was the mastermind, but what about him?\n\nHe was a participant, even acting as the middleman who set things up. His crime was not necessarily any lighter than his cousin's. As for that truck driver, he was practically the hitman.\n\nSo, he didn't dare push his cousin too hard. He was afraid, too.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood why, after he had possessed Xu Le's body, Xu Le had so little money. The bookstore's losses were one thing, but the other reason was that Xu Le had spent most of his money on *that* matter.\n\nHow absurd.\n\nHow laughable.\n\nIn the end,\n\nthis was the reason for his own death.\n\nDejected, he sank back into his chair. Zhou Ze stared at the glass shards embedded in his palm, watching his own blood drip without pause.\n\nHe didn't try to stop the bleeding, nor did he feel much pain.\n\nIn fact, he found it rather interesting.\n\nEven the most brilliant black comedy couldn't have written a scene with as much irony as what he was feeling right now, could it?\n\nThe man he had always considered cowardly,\n\nspineless,\n\nuseless,\n\nso pathetic and humble that even he found him a little pitiful...\n\nwas actually the mastermind who hired someone to kill him!\n\nEverything, all of it, had seemingly come full circle.\n\nYes,\n\nyou could call it karmic retribution, swift and unerring!\n\nYes,\n\nyou could interpret it as fate, predestined by heaven!\n\nYes,\n\nyou could cheer that heaven has eyes, that what goes around comes around!\n\nBut these are all the perspectives of bystanders. Bystanders expect to see a story of evil conclude with the bad guy being punished and the good guy being compensated.\n\nThis gives bystanders a sense of security, makes them feel that the world is beautiful,\n\nand might even put them in a good enough mood to eat a couple more mouthfuls of rice at dinner.\n\nHowever,\n\nwho could pay for the life he originally had?\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head slightly, his body beginning to tremble.\n\nAn intense feeling of rage began to flood his entire being.\n\nDr. Zhou,\n\nDirector Zhou,\n\nhe had walked out of an orphanage, every step thorny, every step arduous!\n\nHe had no connections, no background, and had clawed his way up the hospital system relying purely on his own effort and skill, all while upholding his medical ethics and integrity, hoping to achieve greater success and a higher position.\n\nHe was constantly on edge, as if walking on thin ice!\n\nHe had finally, with great difficulty, climbed to that position at that age.\n\nHe had finally, with great difficulty, made a name for himself in his field through his medical skills.\n\nHow much sweat had he poured into it?\n\nThe countless times he lay in bed late at night, motivating and encouraging himself.\n\nEven more, how many times did he have to grit his teeth and swallow his pride!¹\n\nGone.\n\nIt was all gone!\n\nAnd all because of this useless bastard.\n\nHe discovered his wife's secret crush on him.\n\nHis own wife wouldn't sleep with him.\n\nHe felt wronged,\n\nhe felt furious,\n\nhe felt indignant!\n\nHe wouldn't reflect on why he'd thrown away all his dignity to become a live-in son-in-law.\n\nHe wouldn't reflect on why people looked down on him everywhere he went.\n\nHe wouldn't reflect on himself,\n\nnor would he examine his own actions.\n\nHe aimed the target of his vented fury at him!\n\nIf he had actually had some sort of illicit relationship with his wife, then fine.\n\nBut at that time, he had long since forgotten about the cute little intern he had supervised many years ago!\n\nHe was completely oblivious.\n\nBut on his way home from work, at a traffic light, while he was carrying a cake and gifts to go celebrate Children's Day with the kids at the orphanage,\n\nthat truck driver, who had been paid off,\n\njust stomped on the gas pedal,\n\nand crushed the life he had fought so hard to build!\n\n\"Brother Le, uh, I'm gonna go now. You take care of yourself.\"\n\nThe cousin didn't dare to linger here any longer. He turned, pushed open the glass door of the bookstore, and left. He still had to pick up his old man from the hospital, and given Zhou Ze's current state, he was genuinely afraid of provoking his cousin—a man who usually seemed like a frail, artsy type but who, when pushed, was terrifying even to him!\n\n\"I'm going to kill that guy, kill him! With the money I got from her, I'm going to kill him, ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!\"\n\nTo this day, the cousin still remembered that evening six months ago, the twisted expression on his cousin's face as he slammed several stacks of cash in front of him and said those words.\n\nThis cousin, whom he used to laugh at behind his back, whom he thought was weak-willed, cowardly, even willing to social climb by marrying into his wife's family to the point where his own child couldn't take his surname,\n\nat dusk that day,\n\nhad completely changed his image in his mind.\n\nWatching his cousin's retreating back, the fingernails on Zhou Ze's bleeding hand grew out, then receded, again and again.\n\nWisps of black energy swirled unceasingly around his fingertips.\n\nA violent glint, an intertwining of red and black, flickered in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThis was his enemy,\n\none of the masterminds behind his murder.\n\nHe wanted to keep this person here forever.\n\nHe wanted Bai Yingying to treat this person as food, to suck him dry of all his blood and turn him into a desiccated husk!\n\nBut he just walked away.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, from beginning to end,\n\nnever made a move.\n\nHe didn't even stand up and shout \"Stop.\"\n\nRationality.\n\nThis damned rationality.\n\nThis despairing, nearly soul-crushing rationality!\n\nZhou Ze knew he couldn't kill him.\n\nEven if he ignored his status as a netherworld official and the other consequences that would arise from taking revenge for himself,\n\njust consider this: if he killed him,\n\nwhat would the driver in prison think when he learned of it?\n\nWouldn't he think he was being silenced?\n\nThen, would he have to go and kill the driver too?\n\nYes, the driver was the primary killer who murdered him!\n\nIt was that damned bastard who, on that night, had kept his eyes on him, then run a red light and deliberately crashed into him!\n\nThe cousin deserved to die,\n\nand that driver deserved to die even more!\n\nBut if he killed both of them, no matter how he tried to hide it or stage some kind of accident,\n\nthe police would definitely discover something was amiss.\n\nAnd then, a clear line would be drawn!\n\nIn fact,\n\nthe most crucial part of the matter was that the person who had actually paid to have someone murdered *was the current Zhou Ze!*\n\nHe was the true mastermind!\n\nIf he wanted revenge, killing them would be tantamount to exposing himself.\n\nThey had already ruined his first life.\n\nCould it be,\n\nthat because of them, he had to ruin the opportunity to live again in a borrowed body that he had so painstakingly obtained?\n\nRuin his,\n\nhis second life?\n\nZhou Ze clenched his fists and slammed them heavily onto the counter.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun.\n\nZhou Ze staggered, taking several steps back until his back hit the corner of the wall, and he slowly slid down to the floor.\n\nHe covered his eyes with his blood-drenched hand,\n\nwhile his other hand scraped unconsciously at the tiled floor.\n\nYou're furious,\n\nbut you have no way to vent it.\n\nThis...\n\nfucked-up life!\n\nThis son-of-a-bitch heavenly justice,\n\nthis bastard of a karmic cycle!\n\nIn my past life, I saved a lot of people, and I helped a lot of people!!!\n\nTears trickled from the corners of Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nEveryone has moments of weakness; the only thing to do is cover your weeping eyes with your hands.\n\nEveryone also has moments when they curse the heavens and resent the unfairness of the world; not everyone is a pure robot, always able to calmly analyze themselves when things go wrong.\n\nIn his past life, Zhou Ze believed he had never done anything to weigh on his conscience. In his hands, the lives of many patients were saved, and many people's lives and families were rescued by him.\n\nHe hadn't let himself go adrift, nor had he wallowed in the mire with others. Even with a strong, utilitarian desire to climb higher, he still abided by his duties as a person and a doctor. Because of this, the difficulty he faced and the effort he needed to put in to climb the ladder were far greater than for others who were willing to bow their heads!\n\nOn the corner of the counter, a piece of spirit money lay there,\n\nprobably one left over from the paper money he had burned that night when he returned.\n\nJust as Bai Yingying had said, spirit money from the dead was equivalent to nether-merit.\n\nHeh,\n\nperhaps because heaven saw that he had accumulated too much merit in his past life, it decided to compensate him in this one.\n\nLetting him be \"reborn,\" giving him a beautiful wife right off the bat, letting him own a bookstore. And even, to display his \"Lord Justice\" eminence,\n\nit let him, upon emerging from the underworld, his soul wavering on the verge of collapse by the roadside,\n\nrun into Xu Le, who had been accidentally killed by a petty thief.\n\nLetting him inherit Xu Le's life.\n\nMaking the man who had masterminded his murder pay what, in the eyes of heaven, was a rightful price.\n\nBut... who had ever asked him, Zhou Ze, if he agreed to any of it?\n\nTo the point that,\n\nnow, he,\n\ncouldn't even get revenge!\n\nWhen that bastard walked up to him and talked about hiring a hitman to run over that doctor,\n\nhe could only sit there, dejected,\n\nwithout moving a muscle!\n\nThe last rays of the setting sun\n\nspilled into the corner of the bookstore's doorway,\n\ncarrying away the day's\n\nlast remaining trace of warmth.\n\n\"Oh, right, I just developed a new strawberry juice. Want to have a taste so I can make some improvements?\" Xu Qinglang pushed open the door and walked in, holding a wine glass.\n\nWhen he saw Zhou Ze sitting in the corner with his hand dripping blood, he froze for a moment, then immediately put down the strawberry juice and ran over, squatting down beside him.\n\n\"What happened to you?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Why... This isn't fair... No... This damned fairness,\" Zhou Ze mumbled to himself.\n\nXu Qinglang fell silent. He didn't know what had happened to make Zhou Ze this way. The Zhou Ze he knew had always seemed rational and nonchalant, no matter the situation.\n\nHe was even someone who, amidst his meticulousness and rigidity, would occasionally crack a joke. This was a very self-disciplined person, but self-disciplined people often become even more helpless when they finally break down under a blow.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze reminded Xu Qinglang of himself on the day the little girl took his parents' souls away in his shop.\n\nHe had complained that it was unfair,\n\nbecause his neighbor, Zhou Ze, was also a ghost,\n\nbut the little girl had let him be, choosing instead to take away the souls of his parents.\n\nXu Qinglang sighed.\n\nHe reached out and put an arm around Zhou Ze's shoulders, letting Zhou Ze's forehead rest against his chest, and chimed in with agreement:\n\n\"Bro, I don't know what happened, but I know exactly how you feel right now.\n\nEven the great Chopin couldn't play our sorrow.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

    "content": "Three cartons of cigarettes in her left hand, a bag of sweet rice balls in her right, and a stylish shoulder bag slung over her body.\n\nBai Yingying would never waste any opportunity Zhou Ze gave her to leave the bookstore. Heaven knows how, after buying the cigarettes and sweet rice balls, she had managed to also buy a shoulder bag at such a speed!\n\nPushing open the bookstore door, Bai Yingying saw the scene of two men embracing. She immediately dropped her things, covered her eyes, and peeked with all her might through the gaps between her fingers, not forgetting to stomp her foot coyly and say, \"Ying ying ying, did I come back at a bad time?\"\n\nNoble Consort Xu,¹ oh, no, Xu Qinglang glared back at Bai Yingying, an expression of such aggrieved charm that it seemed ready to melt and drip away like summer dew.\n\nThe sheer force of this boudoir resentment was terrifying to behold!\n\nIt made Bai Yingying wonder if she was the jiangshi, or if the noodle shop owner in front of her was.\n\n\"Have you bought the things?\" Zhou Ze stood up, straightening his clothes.\n\nXu Qinglang also stood up and pretended to button his shirt.\n\n\"Boss, I bought everything,\" Bai Yingying answered obediently.\n\n\"Alright, I'm heading out for a bit.\" Zhou Ze walked over, picked up the cigarettes and sweet rice balls, and said to Bai Yingying, \"You watch the shop.\"\n\n\"You got it.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze left the shop, Bai Yingying and Xu Qinglang faced off, staring daggers at each other.\n\n\"What are you looking at, corpse,\" Xu Qinglang said irritably.\n\n\"If you had stayed hidden in the cabinet, I wouldn't have been able to see you,\" Bai Yingying retorted sarcastically.\n\n\"You're ice, dah! Ice! The kind you can freeze into a popsicle!\" Xu Qinglang shot back.\n\n\"Hah. Your waterway is blocked; take the dry road and you’re bound to run into bandits and have a bloody disaster.\"² Bai Yingying fired back sharply.\n\n\"Hmph!\"\n\n\"Hmph!\"\n\nThe two parted on bad terms. Xu Qinglang returned to his noodle shop, while Bai Yingying, mimicking Zhou Ze, sat down in the boss's chair behind the counter, poured a cup of hot water, then picked up a book and pretended to read with great ambiance.\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze planned to make a trip to the Confucian Temple. No matter how much sorrow life throws at you, you first have to endure it, and then go on living as you must.\n\nIt was like the last night of a short holiday, when the thought of having to wake up early for work the next day fills you with despair. You want to give up on everything, but you still end up setting your alarm clock.\n\nThis is life. For successful people, others are always eager to discuss the secrets to their success, envying their current fame and fortune.\n\nIt's like when a woman has just given birth, and all her friends and relatives come to congratulate her, but no one cares how many times she had to get fucked to conceive that baby. The words are crude, but the point isn't, right?\n\nZhou Ze could only console himself. As for that so-called cousin and the truck driver, how to deal with them was something that required careful planning. At the very least, Zhou Ze was not such a magnanimous person.\n\nHe couldn't muster the same arrogant dominance as that counterpart in Rongcheng, but since this matter involved his own \"murder case,\" it definitely couldn't be let go so easily.\n\nHe took out his phone, about to hail a cab, when he happened to see a WeChat message: \"What are you doing?\"\n\nIt was a message from Dr. Lin.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, a bit uncertain. To be honest, he was in a complicated mood right now, because the reason Xu Le wanted to kill him was that this beautiful female doctor had been secretly in love with him.\n\nAlright, being secretly loved by a beautiful woman... by a beautiful... wife... by a beautiful wife who was also still a virgin... was indeed something to be proud of.\n\nBut in his past life, he had been \"nursed\" to death³ by her like this!!!!!\n\n\"In the shop,\" Zhou Ze replied anyway.\n\nHe wasn't Xu Le; he wouldn't be so irresponsible. The tangled karma between him and Xu Le had nothing to do with Dr. Lin.\n\nAnd to be honest, after discovering Dr. Lin's infatuation with him step-by-step after his death, it would be impossible for him to say he had no good feelings for this woman.\n\nEspecially after his confession at the hospital last week. She had been terrified, panicked, even trembling, but she still hadn't hesitated to hug him.\n\nWhether the heavens were blind or not, Zhou Ze didn't know, but Dr. Lin's existence was truly the biggest bright spot in his life since his return.\n\n\"I'm on the road outside your shop.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up, scanning his surroundings, and sure enough, he spotted a white Maserati at the street corner.\n\nThe previous Cayenne had been scraped against a utility pole when he was driving it that night. Clearly, Dr. Lin had gotten a new car.\n\nAh, the evils of materialism!\n\nZhou Ze walked over, opened the car door, and sat down in the passenger seat.\n\nDr. Lin seemed a bit reserved and at a loss, but it was clear she had summoned great courage to come see him.\n\nAfter all, he was a ghost.\n\n\"Xu Le, he's already...\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. He didn't want to hear anything about \"Xu Le\" right now.\n\n\"Don't mention him. Just pretend he never existed,\" Zhou Ze interrupted bluntly.\n\n\"Then... will this make you think... I'm a bad woman?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nThe Three Obediences and Four Virtues⁴—though not followed so rigidly anymore, Dr. Lin was, in fact, deeply influenced by such residual feudalistic thinking due to her parents.\n\nNow her husband was Zhou Ze... so what about the original Xu Le?\n\n\"Don't overthink it.\" Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\nThe situation was, in fact, just that comical. Once Dr. Lin knew that Xu Le was Zhou Ze, her tone and posture had become much more deferential, as if she were back to being just an intern, and Zhou Ze was still her supervising doctor.\n\nBack then, Zhou Ze had shown no courtesy to his group of interns, male or female, treating them as \"intern slaves,\" making them do all the dirty work, heavy lifting, and coffee runs.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, after his confession, had also gradually begun to display a kind of \"superior\" attitude in front of Dr. Lin. His male chauvinistic tendencies were becoming more and more apparent.\n\nThose who are loved are always fearless.\n\n\"Okay.\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want the silence. He looked at Dr. Lin and noticed she was wearing a pink down jacket and jeans. While her figure was perfectly outlined and it looked quite good with her disposition, Zhou Ze felt something was missing.\n\n\"Wear stockings next time. I like seeing women in stockings,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nDr. Lin froze for a moment, her pretty face flushing red. She felt she ought to be sad. After guessing that Xu Le was very likely dead, she, as his wife, should be grieving, not sitting in a car being teased by Zhou Ze like this. But the feeling of embarrassed anger left her unable to resist.\n\nPerhaps she really was a bad woman.\n\nA bad woman who had committed adultery in her heart.\n\nDr. Lin closed her eyes and, in her heart, resigned herself to her fate.\n\n\"I'm talking to you,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Oh... okay,\" Dr. Lin responded, her face growing even redder.\n\nA smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth. He knew that part of the reason he was speaking so brazenly was to deliberately get back at Xu Le. Perhaps he wasn't a good man either.\n\nWell now, one believed herself to be a bad woman, the other believed himself to be not a good man. In ancient times, they would be a carbon copy of Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing.⁵\n\nAs for the Wu Dalang⁶ in the middle, who cares?\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"Not hungry,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen, silence again.\n\nZhou Ze now genuinely felt that his lifelong bachelor status in his previous life might not have been just because he was obsessed with work with no time for anything else; it might have been because his own emotional intelligence was very low. It's normal to have awkward silences when talking to a girl you don't know, but if you're having awkward silences with your own legal wife, there's definitely something wrong with you.\n\n\"Let's... just go on living like this. Don't tell anyone about my situation. Just treat me as... Xu Le.\" Zhou Ze ground out the name through clenched teeth.\n\n\"Okay.\" Dr. Lin nodded. This was what she wanted as well.\n\nEverything as before.\n\n\"But there's one thing I need to remind you of.\"\n\n\"Please, go on.\"⁷\n\n\"When we're in bed, you're only allowed to call me Zhou Ze.\" Zhou Ze cleaned his ear with his pinky. \"I don't want to suddenly hear you call out the name Xu Le. When we're alone, you can only call me by my name.\"\n\n*When we're in bed?*\n\nDr. Lin's heart skipped a beat. Though long a married woman, she was still a virgin. This kind of topic and insinuation was truly mortifying!\n\nBut she still nodded as if possessed, and softly replied, \"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze really felt this Dr. Lin did have a touch of Stockholm syndrome. If the original Xu Le hadn't been so timid, but instead direct and rough, he might have gotten what he wanted, and then it wouldn't have been to my benefit.\n\nBut on second thought, if Xu Le had been direct and rough, he probably wouldn't have hated me enough to hire someone to kill me, right?\n\nSo what was better? Getting a virginal Dr. Lin?\n\nOr continuing to live in my past life?\n\nWhich was truly better?\n\nZhou Ze slapped his own forehead.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Dr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze with concern. \"Your body... because of that incident... are there some problems with it?\"\n\n*Well, damn.* The formal \"you\" again. Master Zhou felt a wave of elation.\n\nThis Dr. Lin probably didn't just have Stockholm syndrome; she might be a masochist, too.\n\nNo, wait a second, something wasn't right here.\n\nProblems with his body?\n\nZhou Ze immediately looked at Dr. Lin. How could a man allow there to be problems with his body?\n\nImpossible!\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the front seats. A bit cramped up here.\n\n\"Get out of the car,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mm.\" Although Dr. Lin didn't know what he was planning, she still got out.\n\nZhou Ze opened the back door, pointed inside, and said, \"Get in.\"\n\nLooking completely bewildered, Dr. Lin got in.\n\n\"I have to prove that there's nothing wrong with me,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIt was already dark, and the area around his bookstore was deserted.\n\n\"But your appetite... isn't it bad?\" Dr. Lin asked from the back seat, a look of confusion on her face.\n\nZhou Ze's body stiffened. The \"problem with his body\" she was talking about was his inability to eat?\n\n*Phew...*\n\nHe let out a long breath, the psychological pressure lifting.\n\nBut he still had to go into battle lightly armed!\n\nBut Zhou Ze still said, \"I need to prove that another aspect is fine, too.\"\n\n\"What problem?\" Dr. Lin still looked confused.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze slid into the back seat as well and shut the door.\n\nThe sky was dark, the car was shaking, and they had a hell of a time.\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ **Noble Consort Xu (許貴人):** A joke referencing the titles of imperial concubines in ancient China. Xu Qinglang is being teased for his dramatic, \"aggrieved\" demeanor, like a consort in a palace drama.\n² **\"Your waterway is blocked...\":** A creative and crude insult. \"Waterway\" (水路) is a euphemism for the urinary tract, while \"dry road\" (旱道) is a euphemism for the rectum/anus.

    "content": "\"They're in the car.\"\n\nAt the entrance to the bookstore, Bai Yingying sat on a small stool, staring at the Maserati in the distance.\n\n\"Sigh, a Maserati doesn't actually have as much space as a Cayenne. I remember she drove a Cayenne last time, didn't she?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was also sitting on a small stool at the entrance of his noodle shop.\n\n\"The boss scraped it while driving, so she probably switched cars.\"\n\nOriginally, the two had been minding their own business, but the female corpse was no ordinary person. As an existence that had once lain buried underground for two hundred years, her hearing was truly excellent.\n\nDuring those two hundred years, Lady Bai would occasionally come to chat with her, telling her about the world outside, like a close girlfriend.\n\nYes, just like how girls in a university dorm will sometimes gather to discuss matters of length, shortness, softness, and hardness, or watch educational action films from a certain Eastern country together.\n\nBecause of this, although the female corpse hadn't been out for two hundred years, she hadn't fallen out of touch with the times. When Lady Bai wasn't around, she would listen to the sounds from within the earth and upon it. As a result, she had developed an incredibly formidable sense of hearing.\n\nWhen she \"heard\" the plot beginning to slide in an indescribable direction, she immediately brought her stool over. At the same time, she knocked on the wall, signaling Xu Qinglang next door to come out and watch the show with her.\n\nIt had to be said, although the two of them bickered quite a bit on a normal day, they knew how to share when it mattered.\n\n\"Whoa, the boss is getting out,\" Bai Yingying whispered.\n\n\"Huh, that doctor is getting out too,\" Xu Qinglang narrated live.\n\n\"Whoa, the boss opened the back door,\" Bai Yingying continued to whisper.\n\n\"Huh, that doctor got into the back seat,\" Xu Qinglang continued his live commentary.\n\n\"The car is shaking,\" Bai Yingying covered her mouth, her eyes fixed on the scene without blinking.\n\n\"They must be having a blast,\" Xu Qinglang took a deep breath.\n\n\"The air is filled with a sour smell. Did your sour plum juice leak in the kitchen?\" The female corpse waved a hand in front of her nose.\n\n\"Heh, bullshit. Come on, let's place our bets. How long till it's over?\" Xu Qinglang looked at his watch. \"I bet ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Fifteen minutes!\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"One, two, three, four... eight, nine, ten seconds!\"\n\n*Ahem, knock on the blackboard, note the unit of time.*\n\n\"Huh, the car stopped shaking,\" said the female corpse, curious.\n\n\"Could they be changing positions?\" Xu Qinglang frowned. He refused to believe that terrible conclusion!\n\n\"Changing positions after ten seconds?\" The female corpse giggled. \"You must be a greenhorn too, huh?\"\n\nThe female corpse had been there, done that. Back in the day, when Lady Bai had her trysts with the poor scholar and ate the forbidden fruit, she had gained some experience.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression was displeased. As a man who owned more than twenty properties, was it wrong for him to place a little more importance on his first time?\n\n\"The car's moving again!\" Xu Qinglang exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"One, two, three, four... eight, nine, ten seconds!\"\n\n\"The car's stopped again.\" Bai Yingying sniffled. \"Changing positions again?\"\n\n\"Your boss, has he never been married before?\" Xu Qinglang frowned. \"Wait, I think I looked up Zhou Ze's file. It said unmarried. Don't tell me he's a virgin?\"\n\n\"He probably hasn't been married,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"That doctor's brow is untouched, and her legs are held tightly together. She should be a virgin too.\" Xu Qinglang slapped his forehead. \"Hahahaha, this is killing me! I get it! Two virgins, trying something so high-end for their first time.\"\n\nBai Yingying remained silent beside him.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I remember, when the Mistress and that scholar had their first time, the scholar seemed very skilled,\" Bai Yingying said, a bit crestfallen.\n\n\"Those pretentious scholars in ancient times were all cunning devils who loved to deceive you young ladies from good families. In reality, they're all just shameless old pros.\"\n\nXu Qinglang looked as if he had seen through the vanity of the world. \"Holy crap, the car's moving again.\"\n\nTen seconds, stop.\n\nTen seconds, move.\n\nTen seconds, stop.\n\nTen seconds, move.\n\nEvery time the car moved, the female corpse and Xu Qinglang would tilt their heads to one side. When the car moved again, they'd tilt them back.\n\nBy the end, both of them felt their necks getting a little sore.\n\nFinally, the rear car door opened.\n\nZhou Ze and Doctor Lin got out, drenched in sweat. Then they each got into the front seats.\n\n\"I just don't get it,\" Xu Qinglang shook his head.\n\n\"Me neither,\" Bai Yingying also looked baffled.\n\n\"Could it be that Zhou Ze's rhythm is different from a normal person's?\" Xu Qinglang shook his head again.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Bai Yingying guessed.\n\nFinally, the Maserati drove away. The excitement was over.\n\nXu Qinglang and Bai Yingying glanced at each other, snorted, and silently despised the other as a \"scumbag\"!\n\nThen they turned their heads and went their separate ways, one to the kitchen, one to her books.\n\n...\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\nIn the passenger seat, Zhou Ze was panting heavily, the hair on his forehead already soaked with sweat.\n\nDoctor Lin was driving the car, also beaded with sweat, which only added a certain charm to her appearance.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's my fault. I'm not attractive enough.\" Doctor Lin bit her lip, blaming herself. \"I don't have any experience, I don't understand this sort of thing, so you... couldn't enjoy yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned his head back and shook it. \"It's my problem. When it got to that point, it must be my problem.\"\n\nZhou Ze pulled a tissue from the front compartment and wiped his damp hair.\n\n\"We're both doctors. We understand how this works. The problem is definitely on my end.\" Zhou Ze took a deep breath and exhaled heavily.\n\nRight now, he wished he could go straight back, drag Xu Qinglang out, hang him from a tree, and whip him a hundred times!\n\nJust now, Zhou Ze had suddenly remembered what Xu Qinglang had said to him.\n\n*You're using Xu Le's body.*\n\n*So are you cuckolding Xu Le, or is Xu Le cuckolding you?*\n\n*Your body is Xu Le's, the DNA is Xu Le's, and the child would be Xu Le's.*\n\nNormally, it didn't seem like a big deal, but at that moment, Zhou Ze found even his own member disgusting, as if he were holding someone else's.\n\nUnder this psychological pressure, after many attempts, he had finally surpassed Yu the Great in his achievements.¹\n\nA complete and utter failure!\n\n\"Give me some time.\" Zhou Ze lit a cigarette, then thought for a moment and threw it out the window.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze felt it was impolite to smoke in a lady's car, but rather that he felt he hadn't earned the right to a post-coital smoke.\n\n\"Next time, I'll wear stockings,\" Lin Wanqui said very seriously.\n\n\"Then that would just prove the problem is me,\" Zhou Ze said with a bitter smile. But looking at the solemn expression on Doctor Lin's face beside him, his heart softened.\n\nHe even felt he was being a bit of a bastard, unloading some of the anger he had just been feeling onto this woman.\n\n*I'm sorry,* Zhou Ze said in his heart.\n\nNo matter how complicated the hateful relationship between him and Xu Le was, this woman, at least, was innocent, and her feelings for him were very pure.\n\nIn his past life, he had seemed very successful, but six months after his death, it seemed she was the only one who still remembered him.\n\n\"Just stop up ahead. You should go back and get some sleep tonight,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You should also rest early,\" Lin Wanqui said as she stopped the car.\n\nOnly after Zhou Ze got out did she drive away.\n\nZhou Ze had said before that they should keep their lifestyles the same as before, business as usual.\n\nAnd it was impossible not to keep it as usual. Even if Zhou Ze was willing to go back and face the long faces of his father-in-law, mother-in-law, and even his sister-in-law, he wouldn't be able to sleep lying in the same bed as Doctor Lin at night.\n\nWas he supposed to ask Doctor Lin to sleep in the freezer with him?\n\nHe wouldn't freeze to death, but what about Doctor Lin?\n\nOr maybe call Bai Yingying over so they could all sleep together?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't that much of an animal yet.\n\nEating and sleeping, the two most important things in life, were both restricted for him now. It was truly difficult to let himself go.\n\nThe Confucian Temple had closed its gates long ago. This wasn't like the \"Gate Washing\" incident, when everyone was crowding and fighting to offer the first incense.\n\nChinese people have always been very pragmatic about ghosts and gods. Of course, this could also be seen as a virtue.\n\nZhou Ze opened the carton of cigarettes he had brought. Although there had been a little mishap along the way, Zhou Ze still knew what he had to do.\n\nNo matter what, he couldn't just wait around for the little loli to finish her business and come back to erase his temporary status, with his own fate depending on her mood.\n\nHe stuck the cigarettes into the ground in a row. Zhou Ze lit them one by one, then laid out the tangyuan. After doing all this, Zhou Ze clasped his hands in front of him and called out:\n\n\"Junior has brought some things to honor you, Elder. I humbly request that you show yourself.\"\n\nAfter he spoke, he waited for a long time, but there was still no sound.\n\nZhou Ze tore open another carton of cigarettes. As he was about to light them, he noticed that the long row of cigarettes he had just lit had all gone out at once.\n\nLifting his head, Zhou Ze saw the dwarf-like old man sitting on a mound of earth up ahead, his pockets bulging, grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"Young man, you're not being nice for no reason, are you?\"\n\nThe dwarf-like old man carried a gong on his back, his face a web of wrinkles.\n\n\"I do indeed have something to ask you.\" Zhou Ze adopted a very humble posture.\n\nTo be able to lead a patrol around the Confucian Temple, he definitely wasn't some lone ghost. He must be part of the system. Therefore, he should know a lot about matters concerning Hell Wardens.\n\n\"Don't you worry, let this old man do some calculations.\" The old man pinched his fingers together, looking at Zhou Ze with a meaningful expression, and mused, \"This old man has served the Confucian Temple for a full sixty-year cycle, so I have some skill. Whatever you desire in your heart, this old man can surely divine it.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze waited quietly by the side.\n\nFinally, the old man slapped his thigh and declared:\n\n\"I've figured it out!\"\n\n\"I ask for the elder's guidance,\" Zhou Ze asked respectfully.\n\n*This Hell Warden identity of mine, how do I get rid of the 'temporary' prefix?*\n\n*And where am I supposed to go from here?*\n\nThe old man chuckled, \"Heh heh,\" wearing an expression that said, *I have seen through to your very heart.*\n\nIt was as if everything was under his control.\n\nHe leisurely stroked his beard and said, \"This old man already knows what you desire most. So be it. Seeing as you've been so courteous this time, this old man will point you toward a clear path.\"\n\nZhou Ze waited intently.\n\n\"Jiuzhitang Concentrated Liuwei Dihuang Pills,\" the old man said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Huh, that's not it? It can't be. That stuff's a 300-year-old quality brand; this old man took it when I was young and alive, and it worked wonders.\"\n\nAt this very moment, Zhou Ze suddenly had the urge to strangle the smug old man in front of him.\n\n***\n\n¹A reference to Yu the Great (大禹), a legendary Chinese ruler famous for his flood control efforts. A well-known story says he was so dedicated that he passed by his own home three times without entering. The author is sarcastically saying that Zhou Ze, by repeatedly failing to \"enter,\" has surpassed Yu in his commitment to not entering.",

    "content": "\"Er, could I have guessed wrong?\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man tilted his head.\n\n  \"My skills have regressed again, alas.\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man took out a cigarette and started smoking it by himself, looking quite melancholic.\n\n  Zhou Ze calmed his emotions. He couldn't very well say, \"Your calculations actually seem to have a point,\" could he?\n\n  \"Old Senior, I came to ask about the Netherworld Emissaries.\"\n\n  \"Netherworld Emissaries?\" The dwarfish old man frowned. \"I say, young man, what are you doing asking about Netherworld Emissaries for no reason? That lot isn't easy to get along with. If you run into them, you'd better steer clear.\n\n  You have a physical body and were able to come back to life. That's a huge stroke of luck. You should just be secretly happy about it.\"\n\n  The old man said, full of disbelief.\n\n  Zhou Ze frowned slightly. This old man before him, he couldn't tell that he himself was a Netherworld Emissary?\n\n  Although he was just a temp, judging by the divinatory methods the old man had used before, he was definitely no half-baked amateur, yet he had completely failed to detect his status as a Netherworld Emissary.\n\n  Did this mean that the little loli really did just see him as a temp, and that besides the so-called \"Gate of Hell,\" she actually had other important things she never gave him?\n\n  Xu Qinglang once said that the loli came and went in a hurry; she certainly didn't just want to hand over the shift. She just had something she needed to attend to and had temporarily grabbed him to be a free laborer.\n\n  As for the reason she grabbed him, it was simple enough. Wasn't it just because she valued the fact that he wouldn't proactively cause trouble, that he wouldn't make a mess for her while covering her shift?\n\n  But this identity was something Zhou Ze had to take control of. One of his lives had already been ruined. This life, he had to grasp it completely in his own hands, and the identity of a Netherworld Emissary was the best protective charm, keeping him from becoming an undocumented soul, living in constant terror.\n\n  Zhou Ze opened his palm to the old man, revealing the insignia to him.\n\n  The old man's expression immediately froze. His breathing hitched for a moment, and at the same time, his eyes darted around before he came to a sudden realization:\n\n  \"I get it now. That long-tongued girl, she pulled you out to cover for her.\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man clasped his hands behind his back and paced back and forth on the small mound of earth, as if pondering some question. Zhou Ze stood to the side, not making a sound to disturb him.\n\n  Finally, the old man asked again, \"You ask this old man about Netherworld Emissaries. What are your intentions?\"\n\n  \"To better contribute my strength for the harmony of Hell and the peace of the mortal world.\"\n\n  \"Oh.\" The old man shook his head, then nodded. \"Heh, this old man knows what you want to do. You want to replace that long-tongued girl, don't you?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't refute it.\n\n  Not refuting it meant he was tacitly agreeing.\n\n  \"It's not that there isn't a way, and it's quite simple,\" the dwarfish old man said thoughtfully. \"On account of you bringing me so many gifts tonight, I'll tell you.\"\n\n  \"I'm all ears.\"\n\n  \"The Confucian Temple houses the sages. While the sages are on high, men walk the path of the mortal world, and ghosts cross the Bridge of Helplessness.¹ The sages see through it all with a single glance.\n\n  Tell me, does that sound right?\"\n\n  \"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n  \"That long-tongued girl gave you this key, which is equivalent to giving you a semi-official status, but she can take it back at any time,\" the dwarfish old man mused. \"But as long as you enter the Confucian Temple, and I, this old man, personally pray to the sages for you, and you then state your case before them, make some guarantees, show your resolve.\n\n  Basically, take those fine-sounding words you said earlier and make them sound even finer. As long as one of the sages nods, your status will be considered official.\n\n  But there is one thing you must remember: the sages' gazes are like torches, they perceive everything. If you harbor malicious thoughts, or if you do anything out of line in the future, then the ones to punish you will not only be the laws of the underworld, but also the wrath of the sages!\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man had a grave expression on his face.\n\n  \"It's that simple?\" Zhou Ze asked in return.\n\n  \"How difficult indeed.\" The dwarfish old man sighed. \"To gain the favor of the sages and have them bestow this status upon you... this is just one method, a method to at least try.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze nodded and said, \"Then let's give it a try.\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man walked to the entrance of the Confucian Temple and blew a breath of air towards it. A \"clack\" sound came from behind the door; the bolt of the large red wooden doors must have fallen.\n\n  \"You go on in first. Have a good talk in front of the sage statues. I'll take care of the rest for you.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze reached out and pushed the doors open. He looked at the dwarfish old man beside him and, seeing that the other man wasn't moving, found it a bit strange.\n\n  \"Old Senior, aren't you coming in with me?\"\n\n  \"You flatter me. I'm just a running dog at the sages' feet. How would I dare to wander aimlessly before them for no reason? You have a semi-official rank, so you may go in.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze hesitated for a moment but still strode inside.\n\n  The old man gently clapped his hands together, and the wooden doors closed again.\n\n  \"Have a good talk with the sages!\"\n\n  Afterward, the old man took out another cigarette and stuck it in his mouth. Without needing to be lit, the cigarette ignited on its own.\n\n  After finishing the cigarette, the old man smiled, took down his gong and drum, and struck it with force!\n\n  A crisp sound rang out.\n\n  The old man cried out in a high-pitched voice:\n\n  \"The air is dry, be careful of fire!\"\n\n  Immediately after,\n\n  Another strike of the gong:\n\n  \"The air is dry, be careful of fire!\"\n\n  The old man struck his gong, singing and dancing in front of the Confucian Temple, a bit like a Northeastern shaman's dance.\n\n  His short stature made his hopping and jumping appear all the more endearingly clumsy.\n\n  \"Kid, you just keep talking to the sage statues, keep stating your case. This old man will help your plea reach the high heavens!\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man shouted towards the inside of the temple.\n\n  \"Alright, thank you for your trouble, Senior.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze's voice came from behind the wall.\n\n  \"No trouble, no trouble at all. Just bring me a few more cartons of cigarettes from time to time to visit me, and I'll be happy. This old man has no more descendants, and my incense offerings have been cut off. It's so hard to even get a smoke these days.\n\n  It's not that the Confucian Temple lacks food and drink, but I wouldn't dare touch the things in front of the sage lords even if you gave me ten times the courage.\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man laughed, \"Hahaha.\"\n\n  Then he continued to cheerfully strike his gong.\n\n  \"The air is dry, be careful of fire!\"\n\n  *Bang!* The gong rang!\n\n  \"The air is dry, be careful of fire!\"\n\n  *Bang!* The gong rang.\n\n  Each strike of the gong was deeper than the last.\n\n  At the same time, the mallet, which had originally been wrapped in white cloth, began to be soaked through with the color of blood.\n\n  At first,\n\n  The blood was just faint specks, but as he struck the gong again and again, the red began to spread.\n\n  It began to thicken, to become more glaring.\n\n  In the end,\n\n  Every time the dwarfish old man struck, he would send out a large splash of blood, staining his clothes and lending a savage air to his once endearingly clumsy image!\n\n  \"The air is dry, be! careful! of! fire!\"\n\n  *BANG!*\n\n  With the final strike of the gong,\n\n  The dwarfish old man flung the bright red, blood-soaked gong and drum straight into the Confucian Temple, while simultaneously shouting at the top of his lungs:\n\n  \"The sages open their eyes! The evil spirit receives judgment!\"\n\n  After shouting this last line,\n\n  The old man's entire body convulsed as if struck by lightning. His form became much blurrier than before, even showing faint signs of dissipating.\n\n  But he still laughed wildly, shouting to the person inside:\n\n  \"Feeling good? Are you feeling good now!\"\n\n  \"Not really.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze's voice came from behind the surrounding wall.\n\n  \"That's right, you shouldn't feel good! Youngster, today this old man will teach you another lesson: that the ways of the world are fickle, and a man's heart is hard to fathom!\n\n  You can't know a man's heart, let alone a ghost's!\n\n  This old man is staking sixty years of merit from my servitude to have the sages suppress and kill you!\"\n\n  \"Do I... have a grudge with you?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze's voice came from the other side of the wall, filled with profound confusion.\n\n  \"A grudge? Of course there's a grudge!\" The dwarfish old man's body wavered, but he continued to shout, \"This old man forgoes reincarnation, spurns the cycle of rebirth, and turns my back on the afterlife!\n\n  Day and night, I've served in this Confucian Temple, waiting on these ancestors,\n\n  What for?\n\n  Wasn't it all to accumulate some posthumous merit for my descendants, to bestow some grace on my family line!\n\n  My lineage, due to some disastrous deeds committed by my ancestors, has always been thin. That's why I had no choice but to remain here, praying only that the incense of our lineage would not be extinguished!\n\n  But a year ago, my last descendant, the sole heir of his generation, was gone!\n\n  What's the point of these sixty years of me groveling like a good little boy?\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man cried out.\n\n  \"Is it fun keeping these clay statues company every day?\n\n  Hahaha, the heavens have eyes! That day of the 'Door Washing' ceremony for the first incense, I only glanced at you and bummed a cigarette.\n\n  I didn't figure anything out at all.\n\n  But today, you let me do a proper calculation. To hell with your Liuwei Dihuang pills!²\n\n  You let this old man calculate that you are inextricably linked to the premature death of my last descendant!\n\n  This is the cause you created, so today you will reap the consequence!\n\n  This old man is trading sixty years of servitude merit for your soul to be scattered and obliterated.\n\n  It's worth it for you! You're not getting a bad deal!\"\n\n  \"Your descendant, did he die on the operating table?\" Zhou Ze asked from behind the wall.\n\n  \"No, not on the operating table. He died in a car crash.\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man wiped away his tears. Although his form had blurred considerably, his tears also seemed to carry flecks of blood red.\n\n  \"I wasn't a driver in my past life.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze was about to add that he, too, had been killed by a car in his past life.\n\n  \"That drunk-driving bastard, he should have died! His fated lifespan was up! But you, you saved him on the operating table, forcibly extended his life by half a month!\n\n  In the end, his time was up. He died in a drunk driving crash, but he dragged my dear, sweet great-great-great-grandson down with him in that accident.\n\n  You tell me,\n\n  Is this not your karma?\n\n  Is this not the sin you created!\n\n  Is this not the debt you owe!\"\n\n  \"Your train of thought is truly powerful,\" Zhou Ze remarked with a sigh.\n\n  Slowly calming down from his initial state of vengeful excitement, the dwarfish old man suddenly realized something extremely bizarre. Logically, he had sacrificed sixty years of servitude merit to ask one of the sages in the Confucian Temple to open his eyes once.\n\n  Given the usual disposition of those clay sages—lazy to death on a normal day—if there was a ghost in their line of sight when they opened their eyes, they could suppress and kill it on the spot, even a fully-fledged Netherworld Emissary, let alone someone like Zhou Ze who wasn't even official.\n\n  Right now, shouldn't Zhou Ze's soul be crumbling, his spirit scattering, suffering immense agony under the sage's single glance?\n\n  How could his tone be so relaxed every time he responded?\n\n  This wasn't right.\n\n  Something was very wrong!\n\n  \"How can you be fine? How can you be fine!\"\n\n  The dwarfish old man suddenly roared.\n\n  He had thrown away a whole sixty years of servitude merit!\n\n  Zhou Ze walked out from behind the other side of the wall,\n\n  looking at the dwarfish old man.\n\n  The Confucian Temple shrine was enclosed by a rectangular wall. When Zhou Ze had been speaking earlier, he was standing outside the wall on the other side, so to the dwarfish old man standing at the main gate, it sounded as if Zhou Ze was inside the temple answering him.\n\n  The dwarfish old man looked as if he'd been struck by lightning, staring in utter disbelief at Zhou Ze, who had appeared outside the Confucian Temple.\n\n  \"How are you outside? How did you get out!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze gestured behind him with his chin and said:\n\n  \"You've been hanging around this work unit for so long,\n\n  and you didn't know you could use the back door?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Bridge of Helplessness (奈何橋):** In Chinese mythology, this is the bridge every soul must cross before reincarnation.\n2.  **Liuwei Dihuang pills (六味地黃丸):** A common traditional Chinese medicine tonic, often for \"yin deficiency.\" The old man's exclamation is a non-sequitur, likely showing his agitated state and dismissing Zhou Ze's earlier (unspoken) guess about his health.",

    "title": "Chapter Fifty: Those Pair of... Crimson Eyes!",
    "content": "\"You've been hanging around this place for so long, and you didn't even know you could actually use the back door?\"\n\nThe back door here didn't refer to the unwritten rule of using personal connections, but to the fact that the Confucian Temple, besides its front gate, did indeed have a back gate.\n\nIn this world, there's no such thing as love without reason. Pies falling from the sky, according to the laws of physics, could actually kill a person.\n\nIf the dwarf elder had just given him a few pointers, then spoken some cryptic words in a roundabout way, imitating how Patriarch Bodhi tapped the Monkey King's head three times,¹ Zhou Ze might have actually considered it carefully, feeling it was more realistic and trustworthy.\n\nBut the strange thing was that the dwarf elder was just too enthusiastic—so enthusiastic that Zhou Ze felt it was unreal.\n\nCould it be that a trend of being Good Samaritans had started among ghosts in recent years?\n\nEspecially after the elder refused to enter the Confucian Temple with him, Zhou Ze became more cautious and wary. The Confucian Temple wasn't very big; Zhou Ze went in through the main entrance and immediately went out the back to circle around.\n\nAs it turned out, Zhou Ze's choice was the correct one.\n\nJust as the elder himself had said, you can't even know a living person's heart, let alone a ghost's.\n\nFurthermore, what Zhou Ze found absurd was the reason the elder wanted revenge on him. It was because…\n\nHe had saved a patient, and then half a month later, that patient caused a car accident while drunk driving, which also led to the death of the dwarf elder's grandson in the crash.\n\nThe dwarf elder had actually redirected his anger onto him, believing that if he hadn't done everything he could to save that patient's life back then, his grandson wouldn't have died.\n\nWhat a bizarre line of thinking.\n\n\"I was a doctor in my past life. Curing the sick and saving the dying was my duty,\" Zhou Ze said with a slight smile. \"I don't think I did anything wrong. For you to hate me, to hate me to this extent, is truly unreasonable.\n\n\"Perhaps you just felt that with your family line cut off, the sixty years you spent attending to this clay statue were all for naught, so you were resentful and wanted to find someone to vent on, and you chose me?\"\n\nThe dwarf elder glared viciously at Zhou Ze, licked his lips, and said in a hoarse voice:\n\n\"This is the sin you created! Why did you have to save a man who deserved to die!\"\n\n\"In a doctor's eyes, only those who die after all life-saving efforts have failed are the dead. The reason you gave, I don't accept it. That so-called karma is utter nonsense.\"\n\nIf he had to bear the karmic consequences for every bad thing done by the people he saved, wouldn't that be the most absurd joke in the world?\n\nZhou Ze remembered reading in a British veteran's memoir that during World War I, he had personally captured the Führer. He had the chance to turn a blind eye and shoot the short little man, but he didn't; he took him in as a prisoner of war.\n\nDid that mean the British veteran had to be held accountable for all the sins committed by the Third Reich later on?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. There was no reasoning with this guy. The next moment, the nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers began to lengthen, and a black aura swirled around his fingertips.\n\n\"Are you going to get rid of the young one, and take the old one out in one fell swoop?\" the dwarf elder shrieked in a panic. \"This is the Confucian Temple, the resting place of the Sage! Even an official ghost bailiff wouldn't dare act so presumptuously!\"\n\n\"Go fuck yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked straight toward the dwarf elder.\n\n\"I only live by one principle: you just tried to kill me, so now I'm going to kill you!\n\nIt wasn't convenient to get revenge for his past life right now, but if he let this present grudge slide, Zhou Ze's temper would be far too good!\n\nI may not be able to deal with the living for now, but a ghost? You think I can't deal with a ghost?\n\nThe dwarf elder tried to flee, but Zhou Ze's hand grabbed him directly, yanking him backward with force!\n\n\"Screeeech!\"\n\nThe dwarf elder let out a blood-curdling scream, his body becoming even more transparent.\n\n\"I don't want to go to Hell! I don't want to go to Hell! Sage, save me, save me!\"\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nThe clay statues in the Confucian Temple remained as still as mountains. If they truly had spirits, how could they have allowed the dwarf elder's family line to be completely extinguished?\n\n\"Who said I was sending you to Hell?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"You think you still have a chance to go to Hell?\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze thrust forward, then tore his hands apart. The vicious energy that had been building up inside him exploded forth, and the dwarf elder's soul-body was ripped to shreds!\n\nIt was simple.\n\nAnd very clean.\n\nBefore dealing with Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze hadn't known he was so capable in a fight.\n\nBut now, he had a solid confidence in his own strength, especially his abilities against ghosts—though the ease with which he dispatched the dwarf elder had a lot to do with the fact that the elder's soul-body was weakened after sacrificing sixty years of attendant merit.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know if there would be any repercussions for what he'd done, nor was he sure if denying the old man even the chance to go to Hell was in line with the little loli's \"know-your-damn-place\" philosophy.\n\nBut if he always bottled things up like a tortoise, he felt he'd eventually give himself problems.\n\nBrushing the dust off his shoulder, Zhou Ze took out his phone and called a cab.\n\nAfter getting in the car, the driver was very friendly and even offered Zhou Ze a cigarette. This left Zhou Ze feeling \"overwhelmed by the unexpected favor\" for a moment. Then, while smoking and making small talk with the driver,\n\nhe also secretly pressed the burning cigarette tip against the car door.\n\nThe door didn't burn through.\n\nZhou Ze felt relieved. He was truly worn out from the last incident with the paper car.\n\nIt was already one in the morning when he returned to the bookstore. Bai Yingying was sitting behind the counter, looking at the computer, clumsily maneuvering the mouse.\n\nAfter showering and changing his clothes, Zhou Ze was about to go upstairs to rest when he noticed Bai Yingying was still sitting motionless in front of the computer.\n\nHow was he supposed to sleep if she didn't go up?\n\nZhou Ze walked up behind Bai Yingying and discovered that the female corpse was actually playing the single-player game *Beach Head*, and she was playing with great excitement.\n\n\"Time to rest,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Oh,\" Bai Yingying responded, not really processing it.\n\n\"I said, it's time to rest,\" Zhou Ze repeated, his voice heavier.\n\n\"Oh, okay!\" Bai Yingying stuck out her tongue, exited the game, and obediently went upstairs.\n\nThere were two straw mats on the second floor. The freezer had been temporarily moved to a corner. Each lay down on a mat. If an outsider were to accidentally come up to the second floor, they might think they were looking at two corpses laid out on straw mats.\n\n\"Boss, you must be tired today, right?\" Bai Yingying asked tentatively.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. He didn't want to talk about what happened tonight, especially the part about repeatedly passing by his own home without going in. That was nothing to brag about.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze ignore her, Bai Yingying obediently closed her eyes. A faint yin energy began to emanate from her body, causing the surrounding temperature to drop and allowing Zhou Ze's mind to slowly relax.\n\nMmm,\n\nTime to sleep.\n\n***\n\n\"Gurgle… Gurgle… Gurgle…\"\n\nIt sounded like boiling water.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes and found himself floating on a pool of water. Waves of heat rolled around him, like lying in a large bathhouse pool.\n\nIn the distance, there was a wide but very muddy road. Groups of white figures were trudging along it, moving numbly forward.\n\nThis place… was so familiar.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat up, discovering that he could actually sit on the water's surface without sinking.\n\n\"You're here too.\"\n\nA man's voice sounded beside Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze whipped his head around, only then seeing a young man in a hoodie standing next to him.\n\nBeside the man in the hoodie, a small figure was crouched, like a cat.\n\nThe man wore his hood up, obscuring his face, but he gave Zhou Ze a very familiar feeling.\n\nHe just couldn't place who it was for a moment.\n\n\"Don't be nervous. This is a dream,\" the man in the hoodie said. \"Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly. For us dead folk, dreaming our way back to Hell is a common occurrence.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Does a name have any meaning here?\"\n\nThe man asked in return.\n\nZhou Ze was at a loss for words. The man in the hoodie was right; only the dead dream of returning to Hell. Since they were all dead, what was the point of exchanging names?\n\n\"They're coming to get me,\" the man in the hoodie said.\n\n\"Get you?\" Zhou Ze was taken aback. \"Get you and take you back to Hell?\"\n\n\"Heh…\" The man in the hoodie let out a laugh.\n\nThen, he turned to leave, and the cat by his side slowly began to follow.\n\nSuddenly, something clicked in Zhou Ze's mind. He immediately called out, \"Are you the one from Rongcheng?\n\n\"The old Taoist's employee from the netherworld shop?\"\n\nThe man in the hoodie stopped and turned his head slightly to look at Zhou Ze. \"Employee?\"\n\n\"Am I... wrong?\"\n\n\"I suppose that's what I am. You know that old Taoist?\" the man asked.\n\n\"I guess so,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh.\" The man in the hoodie pointed around them. The white mist was growing thicker. He said, \"The dream is about to end.\"\n\n\"This is my first time having a dream like this,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You'll get used to it.\" Perhaps because of Zhou Ze's connection to the old Taoist, the man in the hoodie seemed willing to say a few more words and didn't rush to leave. He pointed to the pool beneath their feet. \"This pool, do you remember it?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked down and nodded.\n\n\"Get in!\"\n\nThe man in the hoodie walked over to Zhou Ze, placed a hand on his shoulder, and the two of them sank into the pool together.\n\nThe water was incredibly clear, with high visibility.\n\n\"Notice anything... missing?\" the man in the hoodie asked.\n\n\"That… that woman… is gone.\"\n\nZhou Ze scanned the pool and noticed the problem. The faceless woman he had encountered on his first trip to Hell was gone!\n\n\"Oh,\" the man in the hoodie responded. Then, Zhou Ze saw two glints of red light appear from under the man's hood. They were his eyes.\n\nBlood-red eyes!\n\nIn an instant, an overwhelming sense of dread washed over him.\n\nA terrible sense of crisis suddenly descended.\n\nThe nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers grew out, and a black halo appeared in his eyes.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Zhou Ze asked, on guard.\n\nThe man in the hoodie smiled and pointed at him. \"Look at yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked down at his body.\n\nHe was stunned to find\n\nthat layer after layer of black hair was wrapped around him. He hadn't even noticed when it had appeared.\n\n\"She's already come for you,\" the man in the hoodie warned.\n\n***\n\nThe morning sun felt warm and pleasant. Xu Qinglang brewed a cup of tea and moved a rattan chair to the front of his shop to bask in the sun. No one would be ordering food delivery at this hour, so he was happy to enjoy the peace and quiet.\n\nA taxi stopped at the intersection ahead, and a high school-aged girl got out.\n\nThe girl was very pretty, with a slightly cherubic face—already the makings of a budding beauty.\n\nThe girl walked up to the bookstore, saw it was locked, and promptly kicked the door.\n\n\"Xu Le, you bastard, get out here!\"\n\nBut there was no response.\n\nXu Qinglang took a sip of tea. \"What do you want with him?\"\n\n\"My sister's been on sick leave at home for over a week, locking herself in her room all day, not eating or drinking. It must be that bastard Xu Le who made her angry again!\n\n\"I'm here today to drag him back to apologize to my sister.\"\n\n\"Your sister?\" Xu Qinglang started to get the picture. \"Your sister must have been exhausted last night, right?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" the little sister-in-law asked with a frown.\n\n\"Nothing. Adults' relationships are none of a kid's business. Just worry about your own little boyfriend,\" Xu Qinglang said, taking on the tone of someone lecturing a young girl.\n\n\"You're a weirdo. Don't think I won't slap you just because you're handsome!\n\n\"Is our family's business any of your business to talk about?\"\n\nThe little sister-in-law raised her hand, signaling, *I'm really going to slap you!*\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed and said leisurely, \"Don't worry, your sister and your brother-in-law's relationship is just fine.\"\n\nThere was one thing Xu Qinglang didn't say out loud, but thought to himself: *Dr. Lin seems like such a traditional woman, who knew she could be so open-minded.*\n\nTo overcome her emotional baggage and embrace a new life so quickly.\n\nTsk, tsk.\n\nIndeed, the power of love was truly mighty and irrational. Throughout history, countless infatuated men and women had thrown themselves like moths into the flame called love.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Alright, here's a little suggestion: tell your sister her Cayenne is more spacious than that white Maserati. It's more comfortable for... doing things inside.\"\n\n\"Maserati?\" the little sister-in-law asked, confused.\n\n\"Yeah, isn't that your sister's new car?\"\n\n\"My sister hasn't left the house in over a week. Where would she get a new car, let alone a Maserati?\"\n\nThe little sister-in-law looked at Xu Qinglang in bewilderment, then, as if realizing something, she kicked the bookstore door again with a thud.\n\n\"Aha, Xu Le, I get it now!\n\n\"You eat our family's food!\n\n\"You use our family's things!\n\n\"My sister even paid for you to open this bookstore!\n\n\"And now that you've got your wings, you've gone and found another sugar mama, haven't you?\n\n\"And that sugar mama even drove her Maserati to come pick you up for a date, right?!\n\n\"Xu Le, you're biting the hand that feeds you! You're heartless!\"\n\n*Clang!*\n\nA crisp sound echoed.\n\nThe little sister-in-law jumped in fright.\n\nShe turned her head to look at Xu Qinglang, who was lying in the rattan chair next to her.\n\nThe sound had come from the teacup falling from Xu Qinglang's hand.\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth hung open, his face a mask of horror.\n\nThen he leaped from the rattan chair,\n\nand started kicking the bookstore door wildly.\n\n\"You son of a bitch!\n\n\"Wake the hell up!\n\n\"What the fuck are you still sleeping for?!\n\n\"You really were screwing a ghost that night!\"\n\n***\n¹ A famous scene from the classic novel *Journey to the West*.

    "content": "Not long after Xu Qinglang kicked the door, Zhou Ze came downstairs and opened it. His forehead was beaded with sweat, and he looked exhausted, as if he hadn't slept well.\n\nTo be honest, he had only just woken up—not naturally, as he usually did, but startled from his sleep.\n\nThe last image from his dream—the strands of black hair coiled around his body—was enough to make his scalp tingle even now as he recalled it.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law stood with her hands on her hips, posturing as if to say, *I need an explanation!*\n\nZhou Ze nodded at Xu Qinglang, gesturing for him to come in. Then, right in front of his sister-in-law, Zhou Ze locked the bookstore door again, shutting her out.\n\nThe sister-in-law looked on in disbelief.\n\nXu Le had actually dared to ignore her!\n\nThe young woman's princess-like temper flared up instantly. She was here to demand an explanation for her sister, and she had also learned from Xu Qinglang about the Maserati woman. How could she just walk away?\n\n*Fine, so you're locking the door, are you!*\n\nThe sister-in-law bent down, found a sizable rock on the ground, and prepared to smash the glass door. But just as she was about to take a running start, Zhou Ze, inside the bookstore, turned his head and glanced at her.\n\nAt that moment, a black halo swirled within Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThe sister-in-law shuddered in fright, stumbling back several steps and instinctively clamping her legs together.\n\nThe memory of being terrified in the bathroom that night resurfaced in her mind.\n\nThat night,\n\nshe had been scared so badly she'd wet herself.\n\n\"Xu Le, you... you just wait!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law spat out one last threat, then left in a panic, silently blaming herself for getting involved. She should just go home and tell her parents everything.\n\nShe'd tell them that the obedient, live-in son-in-law they had chosen themselves now had a woman on the side!\n\n***\n\nInside the bookstore, Xu Qinglang had been trying to find the right words ever since he came in, swallowing hard. He was a man who had seen his fair share of the world, but even he felt a deep, lingering fear.\n\nBecause at the time, none of them—not him, not the female corpse, not even Zhou Ze—had seen the woman for who she truly was!\n\nIt was terrifying.\n\nThe more you thought about it, the more horrifying it became!\n\nIt was like watching a talented impressionist on a variety show imitate a celebrity singing a song; you might find it amusing.\n\nBut if someone were to suddenly start imitating your parents, your husband, or your wife, and live with you, and you didn't notice a thing—\n\nhow terrifying would that be!\n\n\"Last night,\" Xu Qinglang finally managed to say, \"the woman who came in the Maserati... that wasn't Dr. Lin. That wasn't your wife!\n\nYour wife never changed her car. After you told her the truth, she took a leave of absence from work.\"\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted slightly.\n\nHe said nothing, instead sitting down in the chair behind the counter.\n\nIn his dream, the man from Rongcheng in the hoodie had already warned him. So, even though Xu Qinglang's words were shocking, he could handle it.\n\n\"How can you be so calm?\" Xu Qinglang asked, puzzled. \"Or... do you know who that woman was?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"At the time, I honestly had no idea. I thought she was Dr. Lin.\n\nBut thinking back now, a lot of things didn't add up.\n\nShe suddenly came looking for me, acting as if she'd come to terms with everything.\n\nI suddenly became very forward, very impulsive.\n\nAnd she was very cooperative. Every move, while seeming shy and hesitant, was perfectly calculated to stir a man's deepest desires.\"\n\n\"What kind of ghost was she?\" Xu Qinglang licked his lips and asked again, \"What *type* of ghost?\"\n\n\"A woman from beside the Yellow Springs Road of Hell. One who likes to dance with her hands in a pool of water. This woman... has no face.\"\n\nAs he said this,\n\na sudden realization dawned on Zhou Ze.\n\nThe Faceless Woman.\n\nPeople who saw her were always horrified by her bizarre lack of a face,\n\nbut they overlooked something.\n\nShe had no face,\n\nbecause she could create any face she needed!\n\nThat was the true nature of being faceless.\n\n*Only from nothingness can something be born!*\n\n\"The Faceless Woman?\" Xu Qinglang frowned. \"I think I've read about her in a Qing dynasty book of supernatural tales. It said she's a phantom formed from the lingering resentment of the dead on the Yellow Springs Road, always waiting for a chance to return to the world of the living.\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Find that book of tales for me. I'd like to see it too.\"\n\n\"I'll look for it when I get back. I read it when I was a kid, so I probably can't find it anymore.\nBy the way, did you... have relations with that ghost?\nLike you just said, she came looking for you to seduce you, right?\"\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up the new teacup on the counter, and took a sip.\n\nHe said with feigned gravity, \"At the last moment, I sensed something was off.\n\nI sounded the retreat.\"\n\nThere was no way Zhou Ze would admit it was because that damn bastard Xu Qinglang had filled his head that afternoon with all that nonsense about the body, soul, DNA, and being cuckolded, which gave him a psychological block and saved him from being successfully seduced.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze himself was puzzled. His bookstore was filled with physical copies of web novels, plenty of them about reincarnation and transmigration.\n\nThe protagonists in those books had children all the time, and it always seemed perfectly normal and natural, never out of place.\n\nSo why, when it was his turn to live out a plot from a novel, did things get so complicated?\n\nWas he...\n\njust bored?\n\nNo, the bored one had to be Xu Qinglang.\n\nOnly a weirdo like him would be bored enough to help him analyze and ponder such philosophical questions.\n\nBut then again, maybe he couldn't blame Xu Qinglang. If Xu Qinglang hadn't said all that to him that afternoon, the raw rice would have been cooked by now.¹\n\nAnd the consequences would have been severe.\n\nShe was fishing, and if he had taken the bait, he would have ended up like fish on the chopping block.\n\n\"She failed?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Mmm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Then why is she targeting you?\"\n\n\"Maybe she isn't like that Madam Bai, who insisted on finding a match of equal social standing,\" Zhou Ze joked.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Maybe it's jealousy. Because I was able to come back, and she couldn't. And now I have a physical body and a new life,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"But she's back now, too. And it's obvious her target is you,\" Xu Qinglang analyzed. \"That means her return isn't entirely straightforward. There are probably other restrictions.\"\n\n\"For example, someone might have intentionally let her return for a specific purpose?\" Zhou Ze suggested, thinking about the problem from another angle.\n\n\"I get the feeling you know something. So, am I worrying for nothing? You've actually got it all figured out?\"\n\n\"I learned it in a dream.\"\n\n\"Do you really think I'm dumb enough to believe that load of crap?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\nZhou Ze gently touched his forehead.\n\nThe little loli had hastily passed the duties of a Netherworld Messenger² on to him, and the Faceless Woman had been released from Hell.\n\nIt was very likely all to capture that man from Rongcheng—the one who had warned him in his dream.\n\nBut the Faceless Woman was clearly planning to use this official business to take care of some personal schemes.\n\nLike...\n\nsetting him up?\n\n\"Anyway, for the time being, I'll try not to leave the bookstore. I'll wait for this to blow over.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, then leaned closer to Zhou Ze. \"Hey, are you still hung up on that whole body and DNA thing?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Am I that bored?\"\n\n\"Actually, it's easy to get over. DNA is just a piece of code, but a child is also a crystallization of one's soul... Ugh, I can't even explain this topic properly.\nAnyway, plenty of normal guys who haven't transmigrated or possessed a body have kids with their wives that might not even be theirs.\nYou don't need to worry about it so much.\"\n\n\"I never realized how good you are at comforting people,\" Zhou Ze said, standing up. \"Come with me to the bathroom for a second.\"\n\nXu Qinglang followed Zhou Ze to the bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze took off his jacket and the shirt underneath.\n\n\"You need to work out,\" Xu Qinglang said, shaking his head with clear disapproval.\n\nJust then, the female corpse came down the stairs. The bathroom was right beside the staircase, so Bai Yingying immediately saw the two men in there together!\n\n\"Oh my, I just realized I haven't had enough sleep yet.\"\n\nFeigning a yawn, Bai Yingying pretended she was going back upstairs to rest, so as not to disturb their private moment.\n\n\"Get the first-aid kit from the second floor. Get gauze and antiseptic ready,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Right away, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying scurried upstairs to get the items, wondering to herself, *Are the boss and him going to be that rough? They need to prepare for bleeding in advance?*\n\n\"What exactly are you doing?\" Xu Qinglang asked, crossing his arms and looking at Zhou Ze with obvious disgust deep in his eyes.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"You're clearly not gay, so why do you always act like it?\"\n\n\"It's called adding spice to life. Don't you get it?\" Xu Qinglang pointed at Zhou Ze's stomach. \"It may be someone else's body, but you should really work out more. Look at that flab. Tsk, tsk. Disgusting.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails instantly grew long.\n\nXu Qinglang froze.\n\n*Damn,* he thought,\n\n*was it really necessary to get this angry just because I made fun of your body?*\n\nBut in the next moment, Zhou Ze used his index fingernail to lightly trace a line from his jaw all the way down his torso. A line of blood slowly appeared, with droplets welling up.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nfrom Zhou Ze's neck to his lower abdomen, fine black powder appeared. The powder was like a carpenter's ink line—so fine it had been completely invisible before.\n\nAs his nail scraped past, the ink-like lines flaked off.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath, looking at himself in the mirror, and at the long, bloody scratch on his chest.\n\n\"What is this stuff?\"\n\nXu Qinglang held his breath, crouching down to observe the black powder that had fallen off.\n\n\"It's hair,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nHair that had been wrapped around,\n\nhis soul.\n\n\"Boss, I'm coming in.\" Bai Yingying walked into the bathroom with the first-aid kit. When she saw the black powder on the floor, a strange look crossed her face.\n\n\"Boss, is this something you two use... to spice things up?\"\n\n\"You recognize this?\" Xu Qinglang asked, pointing at the black powder.\n\n\"This is Ghost Saliva Incense. It's formed from the resentment of ghosts over a hundred years old. My mistress used to have some.\"\n\n\"What does it do?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"It stimulates a person's impulses. For example, if you wanted to do something at that moment and also inhaled this stuff, it would make you want to do that thing ten or a hundred times more desperately.\"\n\nHearing this, Xu Qinglang's lips twisted into a smirk. He glanced at Zhou Ze,\n\nand laughed.\n\n\"Old Zhou, was that Faceless Woman trying to breed with you?\"\n\n***\n¹ Chinese idiom (生米煮成熟飯; *shēng mǐ zhǔ chéng shú fàn*) literally meaning \"the raw rice has been cooked into cooked rice.\" It signifies that what's done is done; it's too late to change things.\n\n² 鬼差 (*guǐ chāi*) refers to an underworld official or emissary responsible for escorting souls.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze didn't think the Faceless Woman would do anything truly heinous. She was likely under even more restrictions than he was; otherwise, she wouldn't have needed to \"disguise\" herself as Doctor Lin to get close to him.\n\nStill, being targeted by someone like her was certainly not a pleasant feeling.\n\nShe could become a mall security guard, a bus driver, an old grandma on the roadside waiting for you to help her across.\n\nShe could also become the kind older sister in an alley, beckoning you inside for tea.\n\nAs long as you had a social circle, as long as you ever needed to leave your house, she had the ability to get close to you, and you had to be constantly prepared for a sneak attack from anyone around you.\n\nWhat on earth she wanted from him, Zhou Ze didn't know. But judging from the numerous examples in supernatural tales of female ghosts who liked to suck men's yang essence to replenish themselves, the Faceless Woman's motives were likely along similar lines.\n\nOr, did she want his body?\n\nOr perhaps, his current status as a temporary worker?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if the little loli knew about this, but he suspected that even if she did, she wouldn't actually intervene. It was highly possible that the Faceless Woman had been intentionally released by the little loli and her gang of hell's emissaries to help them with things.\n\nThe Faceless Woman hadn't attacked him directly, perhaps due to other concerns. Of course, looking at the now incredibly docile Bai Yingying, it was also possible that the Faceless Woman was very wary of his fingernails.\n\nWhen he had first entered Hell, the Faceless Woman had tried to keep him there, only to be injured by his fingernails, which allowed him to escape. Perhaps that encounter had indeed left a deep impression on her, forcing her to resort to a honey trap to deal with him.\n\nBut there was one point that also made Zhou Ze a bit melancholy.\n\nThe Ghost Saliva Incense.\n\nAn impulse ten, even a hundred times stronger.\n\nAnd he had actually managed to restrain himself.\n\nZhou Ze didn't feel any pride in his strong willpower,\n\nonly a faint, intangible sorrow.\n\nSitting at the counter, he idly flipped through some books. Zhou Ze also went online to search for information about the Faceless Woman, hoping to find something valuable.\n\nHe didn't find anything valuable, but he did find Stephen Chow's movie, *Forbidden City Cop*.\n\nZhou Ze and Bai Yingying then spent half the afternoon rewatching it.\n\nThe movie had a villain who also had no face and could transform into other people.\n\nBy the time the movie was over, it was already evening. Zhou Ze gestured for Bai Yingying to open the shop door.\n\nBai Yingying hesitated slightly. \"Boss, aren't you afraid she'll come back?\"\n\n\"Are we not doing business anymore?\" Zhou Ze retorted. \"Or can you contribute some of your burial goods for me to exchange for cash to help with the store's finances?\"\n\nThe female corpse pouted but went to open the door anyway.\n\nShe was rich. When Madam Bai was buried, she was, after all, the daughter of a wealthy family, so she must have had plenty of burial goods. Furthermore, Madam Bai had lingered in the mortal realm for two hundred years; she couldn't possibly take those *things*¹ into Hell, so they were naturally left behind.\n\nJust looking at how many bags Bai Yingying had bought on her few limited trips outside was enough for Zhou Ze to get the picture.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze had suspected this female corpse was stealing money from the store to fund her shopping, but after realizing that all the money in the store combined wasn't enough to pay for even one of her bags, he stopped suspecting.\n\nMadam Bai had once arranged for an eight-bearer sedan chair to fetch Xu Qinglang, who owned over twenty houses.\n\nBai Yingying was obsessed with designer bags.\n\nThis was definitely not good news for the single dogs of the world. It meant that even after you died and became a ghost, life was still a struggle.\n\nNot long after the door was opened, just as Zhou Ze was making a cup of tea, a middle-aged man walked into the store.\n\nBai Yingying stood still, staring at him.\n\nZhou Ze also found himself watching the man instinctively. Although reason told him it was unlikely the Faceless Woman would be so impatient as to return in a new form so soon, he still had to be on guard.\n\nThe middle-aged man was wearing a leather jacket, faded in many places, and a pair of equally old leather shoes. His pants were casual trousers, not very stylish.\n\nOn his head, he wore a tall hat, which looked a bit comical.\n\nThe middle-aged man walked to a bookshelf and subconsciously rubbed his hands together, preparing to find a book. But as he looked left and right, his brow furrowed deeper and deeper. He complained,\n\n\"Boss, all you have here are novels and that sort of junk. Don't you have anything else worth reading?\"\n\n\"We have these.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured for Bai Yingying to bring over the box from behind the counter.\n\nBai Yingying did as she was told.\n\nThe man squatted down and began picking through the books in the box. After flipping through a few, he saw the covers were all indecent.\n\nFor example, *A Bin*,\n\nfor example, *The Doorman*,\n\nfor example, *Chen Pipi*.\n\nThe middle-aged man's fingers trembled with anger. He shoved the box forward.\n\n\"What are you showing me this stuff for!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was furious. He stood up and pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Are all bookstore owners so shameless these days!\n\nHarboring filth!\n\nA den of filth!\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, propped a foot up on the counter, and ignored the guy.\n\nThe man turned angrily to leave, but as he reached the door, he turned his head and saw a small bookshelf by the entrance that seemed to have some relatively serious books. He stopped, picked out a copy of Mr. Qian Mu's *An Outline of National History*, and sat down on a small stool to read.\n\nZhou Ze paid him no mind. His bookstore, after all, accepted all comers—human, ghost, or something in between. It was just that things were a bit tense right now, and he needed to pay extra attention to the movements of that Faceless Woman.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He took it out and saw it was his sister-in-law's call.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze said, listening intently.\n\nLast time it was Doctor Lin's WeChat; this time, it was his sister-in-law's call. He couldn't rule out the possibility that the Faceless Woman was trying the old \"half-a-butt\" routine again.\n\n\"Brother-in-law...\" his sister-in-law cooed from the other end.\n\nZhou Ze hung up immediately.\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\nVery wrong!\n\nSince when was his sister-in-law so sweet?\n\nThis was clearly the prelude to offering up half a butt,\n\njust like when Doctor Lin said in the Maserati that she'd wear stockings next time.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think he had... no, Zhou Ze didn't think \"Xu Le's face\" had what it took to be a lady-killer.\n\nThe phone rang again. It was still her.\n\nAfter a moment's thought, he answered the phone.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Xu Le, you bastard, how dare you hang up on me!\"\n\nNow *that* sounded right.\n\n\"What is it,\" Zhou Ze responded coldly.\n\n\"I was at KFC studying with a friend, and my wallet got stolen. Do you have any money? Just seven or eight thousand would be great to tide me over.\"\n\nZhou Ze hung up again.\n\nYep.\n\nDefinitely the Faceless Woman.\n\nEven if it wasn't, hearing \"just seven or eight thousand\" was enough for Zhou Ze to decide she had to be the Faceless Woman in disguise.\n\nYes.\n\nThat was it.\n\nThe phone rang again. Zhou Ze was getting annoyed. The middle-aged man reading his book frowned in Zhou Ze's direction, clearly disturbed by the repeated ringing.\n\n\"Sorry, I'll put it on silent,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe man lowered his head and continued reading.\n\nBut his sister-in-law kept calling. Zhou Ze had no choice but to answer one more time.\n\n\"Xu Le, you can't just leave me to die! I can only ask you for this money. I'll borrow it from you, okay?\n\nI won't tell my parents or my sister about the Maserati woman, how about that?\"\n\n\"You should probably just tell them.\"\n\n\"...\" The sister-in-law was speechless.\n\n*What the hell, don't just give up like that! You can still be saved!*\n\nAfter paying all his recent expenses, he only had a few thousand left. If he gave it all to her, he'd be left with nothing but the northwest wind to drink.\n\n\"Xu Le, please, help me out. I'll tell you the truth. I went to a disco with a girlfriend, and both our wallets were stolen. My parents and sister can't find out about this, or they'll kill me.\n\nMy friend has to pay her art class fee tomorrow. Her tuition was in her wallet, and she can't be late with it.\"\n\n\"Tell her to ask her parents,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Her family isn't well-off. She earned that tuition money by working during the winter break. Her family won't give her the money. Xu Le, please, I'm borrowing it from you, okay? When I get my allowance next month, I'll pay you back.\"\n\nZhou Ze was about to refuse again,\n\nwhen just then,\n\nthe voice on the phone said, \"It's settled then! Our taxi just got here. Good thing I still have a little money on my WeChat, enough to pay for the ride, otherwise you'd never see me again.\"\n\nThe call ended, and two girls walked into the bookstore.\n\nThe two were likely classmates. They were dressed normally, but had obviously put on makeup.\n\nAt their age, they were like hibiscus flowers emerging from the water; makeup was actually a hindrance, but unfortunately, at their age, they didn't understand that.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked over.\n\n\"Xu Le, brother-in-law, please help me out,\" his sister-in-law began to wheedle.\n\nThe girl next to her seemed timid, standing close to her friend, looking very embarrassed and restrained.\n\nZhou Ze was trying to think of a reason to refuse,\n\nbut just then,\n\nthe middle-aged man who had been sitting there quietly reading suddenly stood up.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy,\n\nveins bulged on his neck,\n\nlike an animal in heat!\n\nZhou Ze slammed a hand down on his shoulder, pinning the man in place.\n\nAt the same time, he said to Bai Yingying, \"Get the money.\"\n\nBai Yingying took five thousand yuan from behind the counter and handed it to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the money with one hand and gave it to his sister-in-law, adding,\n\n\"You have to pay this back.\"\n\n\"I know, I know.\"\n\nTaking the money, the sister-in-law's gaze wandered over to Bai Yingying. \"Who is she?\"\n\n\"An employee. Your sister knows her,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nWith the money in hand, the sister-in-law was more pliable. She grabbed her friend and quickly left the bookstore.\n\nThe middle-aged man by Zhou Ze's side lunged as if to chase after them, but Zhou Ze spun around and pinned him against the glass window with both hands.\n\nIf this guy hadn't suddenly gone crazy, why would Zhou Ze have handed over the money so readily?\n\n\"So a dog really can't stop eating shit, can it?\" Zhou Ze said in a low voice. \"I was hesitating before, but now there's nothing to hesitate about. I think I'll just send you back to Hell.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man continued to struggle.\n\n\"You won't shed a tear until you see the coffin, is that it?\" Zhou Ze laughed in exasperation. He pointed directly at the glass window. \"Take a look at what kind of hat you're wearing on your head.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked at the glass window. He saw his own \"reflection.\"\n\nIn the reflection,\n\nhe was wearing a tall hat.\n\nOn the hat were written four large, black characters: \"A Beast in Clothes.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man froze completely.\n\nHe instantly stopped struggling,\n\nmurmuring to himself:\n\n\"A disgrace to the learned... a disgrace to the learned...\"\n\n***\n\n¹阿堵物 (Ā dǔ wù): A classical literary term for \"money.\"",

    "content": "\"Yo, a beast in fine clothing?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was just about to close up when he happened to see a \"customer\" in Zhou Ze's shop and came over to tease him.\n\n\"Brother, your getup is quite trendy.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the tall hat on the middle-aged man's head and said, \"What's this supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"The final verdict, of course.\"\n\nXu Qinglang stretched languidly.\n\n\"It's like how ancient emperors, empresses, and high-ranking ministers would receive a posthumous title after they died. Or like how an elementary school student's end-of-term report card will have grades like 'Excellent,' 'Good,' 'Pass,' or 'Average.'\"\n\n\"So, this hat is the evaluation given to him by his social circle after he died?\"\n\n\"More or less. It also depends on luck. Most people aren't famous when they die, so they don't get one of these things. Even celebrities rarely get one. In short, it's all up to luck, just like how you were able to crawl out of Hell while ninety-nine point nine percent of other ghosts have to go and peacefully reincarnate.\n\n\"Oh, right. I remember reading that after Qin Hui died, he had a tall hat on his head that said, 'Framed the loyal and worthy.'\"\n\n\"Then was Yue Wumu's hat 'Serve the country with utmost loyalty'?\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Tall hats are for parading criminals. Why would a good posthumous title need a hat?\"\n\nZhou Ze unclenched his hand, glancing at his right palm. He was getting ready to open the Gates of Hell and toss this fellow in. Just moments ago, the sight of a young woman had sent this guy into a frenzy, like a wild bull in heat. He was truly a beast in fine clothing; he even looked the part, all prim and proper with a bit of a scholarly air.\n\n\"Are you going to send me down?\" the middle-aged man asked, suddenly seeming to have calmed down.\n\n\"What else?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Can you let me finish the last volume of this book?\" the middle-aged man asked, taking a piece of joss paper from his pocket.\n\n\"Heh, are you trying to send off a beggar?\" the female corpse on the side couldn't help but jeer. \"Looks like you were a real failure in life. Not even your relatives are burning any incense offerings for you.\"\n\nJoss paper given by a dead person is different from joss paper burned by the living. Of course, the amount of hell money a dead person has is indeed related to the offerings from their relatives, but there are limits. Otherwise, couldn't you just burn a massive pile and create the richest man in the underworld?\n\nThe middle-aged man pursed his lips and looked at Zhou Ze with a pleading gaze. \"I'm begging you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette off to the side, saying nothing. This was Zhou Ze's business; it wasn't his place to interfere.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the copy of *An Outline of National Studies* in the man's hand and said, \"I've read this book before. In my opinion, it has several obvious errors.\"\n\n\"Any book with academic research value will have its errors,\" the middle-aged man said gravely. \"Errors are also the accumulation of our predecessors' work.\"\n\n\"But what's the point of a book that's all praise?\" Zhou Ze countered.\n\n\"In a letter from Zeng Guofan to Zeng Jize, there is this sentence: 'One must not rashly criticize the ancients.' Boss, although you run a bookstore, you aren't a true scholar.\n\n\"Mr. Qian Mu wrote this book against the backdrop of the War of Resistance. When he wrote it, he had already prepared for the worst-case scenario: the fall of our nation. He wrote this book with the thought that if the country truly fell one day, someone could still rely on it to read in the dead of night, to savor the civilization and heritage of our ancestors.\n\n\"Books of criticism and satire are certainly more thrilling to read, but if the nation were truly lost one day, and someone saw this book full of nothing but ridicule and criticism, who would still have the heart to feel for their old country, for China?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man spoke eloquently, gesturing with one hand while holding the book with the other.\n\nLike a teacher at a lectern, expounding his principles to his students.\n\nVery passionate, very engrossed.\n\n\"You were a teacher, weren't you?\" Xu Qinglang asked with a smile. \"Oh, I mean when you were alive.\"\n\n\"I was a middle school Chinese teacher,\" the man replied.\n\n\"A beast in fine clothing, as expected,\" Xu Qinglang snorted. \"I'm off to bed. Good night, Boss Zhou.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved and left the bookstore, his swaying figure surprisingly graceful.\n\nZhou Ze turned to Bai Yingying. \"His silhouette just now, didn't it look like one of those pimps¹ from the brothels of your era?\"\n\n\"My era?\" Bai Yingying pondered this seriously, then shook her head. \"Even the top courtesans weren't as good-looking as him.\"\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips, not too surprised by Bai Yingying's answer.\n\nThe middle-aged man sat down again to read, seemingly not caring whether Zhou Ze had agreed or not. Reading a little more was what mattered most; perhaps he could savor it a while longer on the road to the underworld.\n\nThinking about the man's earlier agitation at the sight of a young woman, Zhou Ze felt a secondhand sense of unease for him.\n\n\"Boss, he seems quite learned,\" the female corpse said in a low voice.\n\n\"The poor scholar your mistress used to fool around with was also quite learned, wasn't he?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBai Yingying nodded.\n\n\"It's hard to say,\" Zhou Ze said, finding it difficult to quantify. He could only say, \"Mr. Ji Xianlin wrote in his diary: 'I have no other hopes in this life, I only hope to be able to sleep with more women, to have contact with women from all different places.'\"\n\n\"Scholars really are all lecherous,\" Bai Yingying muttered.\n\n\"All men are lecherous,\" Zhou Ze corrected.\n\nBai Yingying looked at Zhou Ze and said coquettishly, \"But Boss, you have such great self-control.\"\n\n\"Go scrub the toilet.\"\n\n\"...\" said Bai Yingying.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze didn't rush to open the Gates of Hell and put the middle-aged man inside. Instead, he sat down across from him, took out his phone, and casually browsed the web.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe other man didn't answer, seemingly immersed in the atmosphere of reading.\n\n\"If you don't answer, you don't get to read.\"\n\n\"Ren Xindu.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Just as he was about to try searching the man's name to see if he could find any old scandals, the bookstore door was pushed open again.\n\nThe sister-in-law had returned.\n\n\"What are you back for?\" Zhou Ze stood up and instinctively reached out to press down on the middle-aged man's shoulder, afraid the guy would go into heat again.\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze's surprise, the middle-aged man just sat there quietly reading, showing no signs of agitation at all.\n\n*Huh, he's learned his lesson this time?*\n\nThe sister-in-law took out her phone, panned it around the bookstore, took a picture of Zhou Ze, and sent it. Then she played a voice message:\n\n\"Sis, I told you I was at Xu Le's bookstore reading all afternoon, but you didn't believe me.\n\n\"Fine, fine, I'm heading back now, okay? Right away.\n\n\"Geez, can't even let a person read in peace.\"\n\nAfter sending the message, the sister-in-law stuck out her tongue, let out a long breath, and said:\n\n\"That was close. Good thing I hadn't hailed a cab yet, or I would've been busted.\"\n\n\"You're still young. Don't go to those shady places, you'll get taken advantage of easily.\"\n\nZhou Ze still offered a word of caution, even if she wasn't his actual sister-in-law. It was purely the admonition of a middle-aged uncle to a young junior.\n\n\"Alright, alright, Xu Le, how did you become just like my sister?\" The sister-in-law clearly hadn't listened.\n\n\"Where's that girl?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She went home. I just watched her get a cab. She lives pretty far away. I was about to get a cab myself when my sister happened to message me to check up on what I was doing.\"\n\n\"What about the money?\"\n\n\"Of course I let her take it with her,\" the sister-in-law said nonchalantly. \"Don't worry, it's just five thousand yuan. I'll pay you back when I get my allowance.\"\n\n\"You'll pay me back?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yeah, who else? Her?\n\n\"Her father is paralyzed at home, and her mother runs a breakfast stall. Life is really tough for them, and I don't want to see her suffer through part-time jobs anymore.\n\n\"Oh, and also, she was molested by her homeroom teacher in middle school, which is why she's so quiet and withdrawn now.\n\n\"I consider her a good friend, so of course I have to take care of her a little more, right?\n\n\"Alright, Xu Le, that's all for today. I'm heading out.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law waved and pushed open the bookstore door to leave.\n\nZhou Ze sat back down in his chair, looking from his phone to the middle-aged man who was engrossed in his book.\n\nThen he muttered to himself:\n\n\"Molested a student in his own class, and after being found out, jumped off a building and killed himself.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man continued to read as if he hadn't heard a thing, but his tall hat was so distinct, so jarring.\n\nIn ancient times, criminals were tattooed on the face to mark their identity and brand them as lower-class. This tall hat had a similar effect.\n\nBai Yingying worked quickly. She couldn't help it; she was once a young lady from a wealthy family, but now she had to bow to circumstances. Plus, Zhou Ze's bit of a neat freak undoubtedly increased her workload.\n\n\"Boss, I'm exhausted.\"\n\nBai Yingying took off her outer coat. The cold didn't bother her, and she came out in just a short-sleeved shirt, holding a rag.\n\nShe looked very young, but she was well-developed.\n\n\"Boss, how come he's not reacting to me?\" Bai Yingying asked, puzzled.\n\n\"You're a dead person.\"\n\n\"But I'm very pretty, too,\" Bai Yingying said, striking a coquettish pose.\n\n\"Forget it. You're so cold down there, any man who went in would probably freeze solid and be eternally erect. Wouldn't even need Viagra.\"\n\n\"I've never had a boss who insults people like you do,\" Bai Yingying said, rolling her eyes at Zhou Ze. \"By the way, did your sister-in-law come back just now? I heard her voice from the bathroom.\"\n\n\"Yeah, she came and went.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of something.\n\n*That's not right.*\n\nIf this middle-aged man didn't react to Bai Yingying because she was a zombie, then how come he didn't react to his sister-in-law just now either?\n\nBy process of elimination, it was easy to arrive at an answer:\n\nThis guy was only interested in the girl with his sister-in-law.\n\nThe online news reports didn't have photos, to protect the privacy of the assaulted girl.\n\nSome things...\n\ndon't hold up to scrutiny,\n\nand they don't hold up to thought.\n\nSlowly,\n\nZhou Ze figured it out.\n\nHis sister-in-law seemed feisty, but she was actually incredibly naive, like a big dummy.\n\n\"Hey, was that girl your student?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe middle-aged man continued to read, not answering.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and snatched the book from the man's hands. \"I'm asking you a question.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked up at Zhou Ze, then nodded.\n\n\"Did you, or did you not, molest her?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe middle-aged man was silent again.\n\n\"If you don't answer properly, I'll send you to Hell right now,\" Zhou Ze threatened.\n\n\"I've finished the book. I'm ready to go,\" the middle-aged man said, standing up with an air of nonchalance.\n\n\"Trying to be Wen Tianxiang, are you?\" Zhou Ze said sarcastically.\n\n\"No matter what she's like, she was still my student. It's my responsibility for failing to educate her well,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"You mean the news report I just read was fake? That you didn't molest her, and she deliberately smeared you to get compensation from the school?\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips.\n\nIn that case, it was easy to figure out. The girl probably stole his sister-in-law's wallet, then made up a story to get another five thousand yuan from her.\n\nWould a girl from a poor family who had worked a whole winter break carry her five-thousand-yuan tuition fee with her to a nightclub to party?\n\nHis sister-in-law had walked right into her trap.\n\n\"Tell me, did you, or did you not, molest her,\" Zhou Ze demanded, grabbing the middle-aged man's shoulder seriously.\n\nThe middle-aged man was silent for a moment, then said, \"This is my business. It has nothing to do with you.\"\n\n\"To hell with you, that was my five thousand yuan!\"\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to slap him across the room, but he held back. He raised his hand and swung it at the man's hat, but when it made contact, Zhou Ze felt a searing pain in his palm.\n\nThis hat...\n\nwas so hard...\n\nIt actually caused a stinging pain around his fingernails.\n\nAnd even as the man was sent flying, the hat remained firmly rooted to his head.\n\nZhou Ze recalled what Xu Qinglang had said earlier: *The voices of many can melt metal.*²\n\nThis hat...\n\nregardless of the truth...\n\nwas never coming off.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Pimp:** The original term is `龜公` (guīgōng), a derogatory term for a man who works in or manages a brothel.\n2.  ***The voices of many can melt metal:*** This is a translation of the Chinese idiom `眾口鑠金` (zhòng kǒu shuò jīn), meaning that widespread rumors and public opinion, whether true or not, have the power to overwhelm the truth, just as intense heat from many sources can melt metal.",

    "content": "\"Mom, I'm home.\"\n\nThe girl pushed open the door and called out. From the inner room came the sound of her parents arguing.\n\nIt didn't matter to her parents whether she was home or if she'd had dinner.\n\nHer father was paralyzed and bedridden. Though he could move a little, he couldn't do anything other than struggle to use the chamber pot on his own.\n\nHer mother had to run a breakfast stall outside every day, working from dawn till dusk.\n\nBy all rights, their family's atmosphere should have been like the ones often depicted in TV reports and newspaper articles:\n\nImpoverished and resilient,\n\nyet not without the warmth and harmony of a family.\n\nAnd she herself should have been a good student, making her parents proud.\n\nBut perhaps such fairytale stories were the exception,\n\nbecause her family was worlds apart from the ones she'd seen in those reports.\n\nHer father, paralyzed at home, had failed to cultivate any sense of peace or character. He had a violent temper, especially toward her mother who worked all day. He constantly berated her, accusing her of having another man, a lover, on the side.\n\nHe called her shameless, a cheap whore.\n\nHer mother would always argue back, and then her father would throw things and roar.\n\nIt seemed the man would spend the rest of his life's energy lying in bed, cursing.\n\nAnd yet, she couldn't bring herself to feel complete sympathy for her mother. The little pieces of jewelry and the clothes her mother occasionally brought home were clearly not styles she would buy for herself.\n\nWhat's more, one time when she was at a hotel with her boyfriend, she ran into her mother—who was supposed to be out buying ingredients—entering the very same hotel with another man.\n\nThe two parties had nearly entered the same elevator. If she hadn't reacted quickly and told her boyfriend she needed to use the restroom, a horribly awkward scene might have unfolded.\n\nIt was a broken home.\n\nIt looked ready to collapse at any moment; in reality, it was already falling apart at the seams.\n\nShe didn't know why her mother didn't divorce her father. Nor did she understand how her father, a man who lay in bed unable to work, earn money, or even do chores, could lack the slightest shred of self-awareness.\n\nIn any case,\n\nShe would habitually unlock the door with her key.\n\nHabitually hear her parents arguing.\n\nHabitually walk into her small attic room.\n\nHabitually pour herself a glass of cool boiled water.\n\nHabitually open her new-model Apple laptop.\n\nHabitually take out the gentle makeup remover she’d just bought.\n\nHabitually open a video by the beauty blogger she often watched.\n\nHabitually log on to Zhihu.\n\nThis was her life, and this was her rhythm now.\n\nThe college entrance exams were, for her, a distant and unattainable dream. Her grades were so poor she had already given up all hope.\n\nShe had some regrets.\n\nShe regretted that, back in middle school, she had accused her homeroom teacher of assaulting her, all for a few tens of thousands of yuan.\n\nAt the time, her mother had been frantic, her father too. After she made the claim, her mother stopped going to her stall for several days. She called over a few relatives, and together they carried her paralyzed father on a stretcher to the school gates.\n\nThe couple clutched each other and wept bitterly.\n\nSo tragic, so sorrowful, so bleak. ¹\n\nReporters who caught wind of the story swarmed in like sharks that had smelled blood.\n\nMoral decay, a lack of humanity—\n\nthese were the hot-button issues reporters loved most. They rarely crossed any political lines, making the risk extremely low, but the attention they could generate was immense.\n\nIn any case,\n\nthe way things unfolded had taken her by surprise.\n\nAt first, she had only wanted a little more spending money for clothes.\n\nHer homeroom teacher, who also taught Chinese, knew about her family's situation and had helped her out. He would even pay some of her school and miscellaneous fees for her in advance.\n\nOccasionally, Teacher Ren's mother would invite her to their home for dinner.\n\nTeacher Ren wasn't married,\n\nand the fact that she was often running to his office or his home,\n\ncertainly gave people an opportunity to gossip.\n\nThe rumors had been flying even before her accusation, but at the time, she hadn't cared.\n\nThough, she had heard them.\n\nThen one night, after she had snuck out to a bar, her teacher saw her on her way out. After that, he grew cold toward her. He seemed very disappointed in her.\n\nHis mother stopped inviting her over for dinner.\n\nHe even stopped paying her school fees for her in advance.\n\nHe no longer helped her out financially.\n\nThis enraged her.\n\nSo she threatened him, claiming he had assaulted her, to demand money. She needed money—for the lipsticks she coveted, the clothes she wanted, the imported products she had her eye on.\n\nBut the teacher refused, even when she threatened to go public.\n\nEven now, she still felt that her middle school homeroom teacher was truly a man of letters.\n\nBack then, he had even pounded the desk and scolded her, \"Justice will prevail in the hearts of the people!\"\n\nHowever,\n\nwas that really true?\n\nOnce the story broke,\n\nhe was immediately suspended from the school.\n\nThe immense pressure from public opinion finally broke him.\n\nHe fought back angrily.\n\nHe posted long-winded rebuttals online,\n\nfull of \"zhi, hu, zhe, ye.\" ²\n\nEven though she was only a middle schooler at the time—and a bad student at that—she could see that his rebuttals were pale and powerless.\n\nThey seemed forceful on the surface, full of righteous indignation and unafraid of slander.\n\nBut to outsiders, it looked like stubborn denial, a self-righteous attempt to use his status as a teacher to get away with it.\n\nThe teacher had taught Chinese his whole life, had taught countless students how to write a good essay, but when it came to his own \"essay,\" he wrote it poorly.\n\nThat wasn't the kind of response the public wanted to see. In fact, his forceful, Lu Xun-esque³ rebuttals and sarcasm only further agitated the court of public opinion.\n\nWhat?\n\nWe're all wrong?\n\nAnd you're the only one who's right?\n\nImpossible.\n\nAnd so, the backlash grew even more intense.\n\nThese days, a celebrity caught in a scandal would immediately hire a PR firm to manage the situation.\n\nIf simply stating the facts and reasoning things out was enough,\n\nthen most PR firms would starve.\n\nThen, another piece of information was dug up: the teacher had an uncle who was a section chief in the local education bureau.\n\nHe was a minor section chief, over fifty and a stickler for rules. An old-fashioned scholar who enjoyed studying the School of Mind,⁴ he had poor interpersonal skills and no chance of further promotion at his age.\n\nBut for this news, all the public needed was a simple headline: *Beast Teacher's Connections Exposed!*\n\nAnd with that, everything exploded.\n\nPeople gave free rein to their \"outrage,\" feeling as though they were fighting against the forces of darkness and worldly power.\n\nThe media reveled in the traffic and exposure.\n\nIt was a gluttonous feast she had set in motion.\n\nIn the end, it was the teacher's leap from the roof of the school building that brought it all to a close.\n\nAnd the tens of thousands of yuan the school had paid her family in the beginning—to quiet things down and restore normal school operations—served as the \"final verdict\" on the matter.\n\nIf they weren't guilty,\n\nwhy would they pay?\n\nRight.\n\nWhen she learned of her teacher's death,\n\nshe was in agony for a night. Then, she felt regret for a month.\n\nThe night of agony was because she still had a conscience.\n\nThe month of regret was because she realized that if she had waited until college to pull a stunt like this, she could have profited much more—guaranteed admission to a graduate program, for instance, or a much larger settlement.\n\nShe took a wallet from her pocket. It belonged to a classmate of hers, a girl named Lin Yi.\n\nInside was a lot of cash and several VIP cards.\n\nA sarcastic smile touched her lips. *Heh, rich people.*\n\n*Rich bitch.*\n\nShe took the five thousand yuan from her pocket and put it in her small, locked drawer. She felt it was a good haul for the day. In fact, she had received many donations after the incident, all of which she had split evenly with her parents.\n\nShe removed her makeup and washed her hair.\n\nThen she reopened her web browser.\n\nLogged on to Zhihu.\n\nTonight, she was going to write about her day.\n\nOn Zhihu, for example, she had a brother-in-law who owned a bookstore, a sister who was a doctor, and a father who owned a pharmaceutical company and had once been a hospital director.\n\nShe wrote about a classmate—that \"green tea bitch\"⁵ who'd claimed a teacher assaulted her—who had lost her wallet today. She wrote that although she privately looked down on the girl, she still got five thousand yuan from her brother-in-law to give to her.\n\nBecause for her, five thousand yuan was just a fraction of her monthly allowance.\n\nShe'd just chalk it up to pitying the green tea bitch.\n\nShe had a large following of fans who followed her every update. The moment she posted, comments and likes would pour in. She loved this feeling. Here, she had found a new life.\n\nSometimes, she even had trouble telling the difference between her virtual life online and her actual reality.\n\nShe felt that she *was* Lin Yi.\n\nOf course, some people accused her of being a snob, using her family's wealth to look down on the poor.\n\nShe would calmly reply: Who care?\n\nShe closed her laptop, ready for bed. Late nights were a woman's worst enemy, and she needed to take care of herself. Her looks, it seemed, were the only thing of real value her parents had given her.\n\nShe went to the bathroom to wash up.\n\nHer parents' argument was still going on. Her father was smashing a cup and cursing her mother. Her mother cursed him back, calling him a good-for-nothing and asking why he didn't just hurry up and die—go find a car, lie down in the road, and at least get the family some compensation money. That would be him finally fulfilling his responsibility as a man.\n\nHearing this, she just smiled to herself.\n\nAfter washing up, she returned to her bedroom.\n\nShe opened the door,\n\nonly to find someone sitting on her bed.\n\nA man.\n\nThe man was smoking,\n\ntapping the ash into the lid of one of her new skincare products.\n\nFor a moment, she didn't know how she was supposed to act in front of this man.\n\nThe man had reopened the laptop she had just closed.\n\nHe was reading her posts on Zhihu.\n\nThe silence,\n\nlasted for about three minutes.\n\nFinally, her voice trembling, she asked, \"What are you doing here.\"\n\nShe recognized him. She had just seen him. It was Lin Yi's brother-in-law, the one who owned the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze stubbed the cigarette out in her skincare product.\n\nThe corner of her mouth twitched. That one was expensive; she'd bought it after spending a night with an old man.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her with a smile that wasn't quite a smile.\n\nThen, he said very seriously:\n\n\"Give me the money back.\"\n\n---\n¹ *淒悽慘慘戚戚 (qī qī cǎn cǎn qī qī)*: A famous line from a poem by Li Qingzhao, evoking a deep sense of misery and sorrow.\n\n² *之乎者也 (zhī hū zhě yě)*: Classical Chinese grammatical particles, used here to describe a pedantic, archaic writing style that sounds out of touch.\n\n³ *魯迅 (Lu Xun)*: A highly influential Chinese writer from the early 20th century, known for his sharp, satirical critiques of society.\n\n⁴ *心學 (xīnxué)*: The School of Mind, a major philosophical school of Neo-Confucianism, which teaches that the mind is the source of principle and reality.\n\n⁵ *綠茶婊 (lǜ chá biǎo)*: A Chinese internet slang term for a woman who appears innocent, sweet, and pure on the surface but is actually manipulative, calculating, and often promiscuous.",

    "content": "In the room, the girl didn't say anything. Zhou Ze slowly placed the second smoke, then took out a box of the girl's foundation and turned it on. It seemed that he planned to continue using it as a cigarette ashtray.\n\n\n\nOf course, the quarrel between the girl’s parents outside continued, and the girl’s mother started crying, saying that the man had no conscience, and then the man started crying, saying that the woman had changed.\n\n\n\nThe girl slowly raised her head and looked at Zhou Ze:\n\n\n\n\"Big brother, I don't know what you mean. Lin Jing and I are good friends, and you are her brother-in-law, so we should...\"\n\n\n\n\"Buzz\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took out a dagger from his pocket and barbed it on the girl's desk\n\n\n\nThis is one of the burial objects of the girl. She said that the iron is as sharp as mud, which is a shame, but it is indeed very delicious.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to play \"Nine-Yin White Bone Claws\" like Mei Chaofeng when facing ordinary people, because that means a lot of trouble, and Zhou Ze was most afraid of trouble.\n\n\n\nA dagger,\n\n\n\nA sound of \"buzzing\",\n\n\n\nThe competition passed thousands of words\n\n\n\nThe girl's face began to change slowly\n\n\n\nZhou Ze originally thought that things should be done. He came here just to get back the money he gave and also take back the money bag of the silly sister-in-law.\n\n\n\nHe didn't expect too many outlines, even he thought that the best outcome was that the girl was hit and killed by a car when she left the door.\n\n\n\nThe person in Rongcheng's front car is still there.\n\n\n\nZhou Cheng had to do something extra-legal punishment.\n\n\n\nHe is not that leisurely, nor has he had that kind of sentiment\n\n\n\nHe only has money because he is worth it\n\n\n\nSometimes, life really requires a lot of courage, especially when you look around.\n\n\n\nMy wife is very rich. I buy my own house as a souvenir and open a cayenne. My sister-in-law is also very rich. Five thousand pieces are just part of a month’s pocket money.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang has more than twenty suites.\n\n\n\nWhite jeans also have funeral objects.\n\n\n\nI have money around me, but I just have to squeeze my hands with money\n\n\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze still underestimated the girl\n\n\n\nA girl who had already entered society and had long been accustomed to \"knife\", at this time, the coldness she showed was revealed.\n\n\n\nIt can almost make people feel cold\n\n\n\nThe girl unbuttoned her clothes.\n\n\n\nOnly one set of underwear is left.\n\n\n\nBut next,\n\n\n\nHer underwear is ready to be unbuttoned\n\n\n\n\"You are going to kill someone.\" The girl smiled at the corner of her mouth, and she was shocked in her eyes. Instead, she was very deep, so deep that it made people feel a little incredible.\n\n\n\n\"You come and kill me.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl took the initiative to take a step towards Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\n\"My father was in bed, he had no ability to stop you\n\n\n\nMy mother and I are both women and can't beat you\n\n\n\nYou come and kill it,\n\n\n\nKill our whole family”\n\n\n\nThe girl walked to Zhou Ze, her voice sounded calmlyZhou Ze looked at the girl, and admired the other person's body\n\n\n\n  only,\n\n\n\nIt's definitely a little headache\n\n\n\nThis place,\n\n\n\n There is no need to avoid being cold\n\n\n\n  and,\n\n\n\nShe seemed to be sure that she didn't want to kill anyone\n\n\n\nZhou Ze regretted it a little. If he had known that he should have come here and let women come to deal with women, it seemed the most suitable way.\n\n\n\n\"Or, I'm shouting now and you're going to be strong and raped by your illegal entry.\" The girl lowered her head and let her young face roll in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\n\"Then, my parents will hear my voice coming, the neighbors will come, and there will be someone to call the police, and you will be disgraced.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze smiled and said, \"Is it true that I can't tell you my money this time, but I also have to give you another money to save you?\"\n\n\n\n\"You're not short of money, right?\" The girl raised her lower body slightly. Her lower body was round and her bones were very delicate. Even her eyelashes were full of charming postures of the young girl. \"Lin family, very rich.\"\n\n\n\nBut I'm so terrible\n\n\n\nZhou Ze spoke helplessly\n\n\n\n\"A thousand pieces, I'll sleep with you once.\" The girl stared at Zhou Ze, stuck out her tongue and licked her lips, \"It's here, right here, right next to my parents' room, what's going on?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt the breath of an old driver coming,\n\n\n\nShame,\n\n\n\nAll the shame,\n\n\n\nAfter the last three families left their homes,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt that the girl in front of him was rich enough to lead him into the door\n\n\n\nBut her skin looks very beautiful.\n\n\n\nBut inside,\n\n\n\nSome poisonous\n\n\n\n\"Your teacher was also forced to death by you at the beginning,\" Zhou Ze asked\n\n\n\nThe girl was stunned for a moment, slightly bent her eyebrows, and was a little surprised at why Zhou Ze knew about this.\n\n\n\n\"He is good to you, he often takes you, and asks you to eat at home if it is inconvenient. He has never touched you, and you are involved in saying that he has violated you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry for him.\" The girl said with all her favours, \"He didn't touch me, but I really didn't expect that he would be so stupid that he jumped into the building and killed me. At that time, he just wanted to pay some money at school.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your parents, you know it too,\" Zhou Ze asked\n\n\n\n\"Of course\" the girl smiled slightly, stood up straight, and looked at Zhou Ze, \"How did you know these?\"\n\n\n\n\"You do this, it's wrong,\" Zhou Ze said seriously\n\n\n\nHe raised his hand slightly and imitated the scheming of the middle-aged man reading books in the bookstore:\n\n\n\n\"He deserves his conscience and his professional ethics, and these are the things he values the most, and you have destroyed them all.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are here to teach\" the girl couldn't understand the brain around her.\n\n\n\nAll his clothes were removed, and only he had to unbutton his last button. As a result, the man in front of him was taking classes with him hereShe had met a guest before, who was a good professor and was generous in his actions. Before doing things, she also taught her to study hard and not do this. The girl should respect herself and ask to teach her.\n\n\n\nThen the professor asked him for seven times in one night\n\n\n\nThis kind of person is the most vulgar. He is obviously planning to uncover the belt, but he still wants to wear a gentleman with you.\n\n\n\n\"You should give your teacher a name, he was trapped,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\n\"What to worry about\"\n\n\n\nThe girl took two steps back and put on her clothes. She knew that the man in front of her was not interested in her.\n\n\n\n\"Respect the conscience, the conscience of being a human being\"\n\n\n\n\"The conscience of being a human being\" the girl put her hands on her hands and pretended to be a joke, \"I don't want to be a human being. If there are any choices, I want to be a ghost.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, that's it?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up,\n\n\n\nThe two hands were stuck behind the body, and the nails had completely grown out.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a black aperture began to flow in Zhou Ze's eyes, and the whole person's temperament changed instantly.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, my careless sister-in-law saw her like this and was so scared that she was incontinent.\n\n\n\nThe girl in front of her also changed her face and sat down on the ground with a \"thump\" sound, pointing at Zhou Ze, so scared that she couldn't speak.\n\n\n\n\"You...you are human or ghost...\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took out five thousand pieces of money from the drawer, and his sister-in-law's money bag and put it in his pocket.\n\n\n\nAs for the other things inside, he was not interested\n\n\n\nHe just came back to take away the money he was cheated on.\n\n\n\nReasonable and legal\n\n\n\nHe doesn't want to do other things\n\n\n\nWhen leaving, Zhou Ze lowered his waist, reached out and lifted the girl's chin, and said to her very seriously:\n\n\n\n\"I wish you were a ghost now. In that case, I would never have the chance to reincarnate you.\"\n\n\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze left this home with a strong storm\n\n\n\nAnd the girl was sitting there, her body kept slamming\n\n\n\n …………\n\n\n\nWalking outside, Bai Baoyu was waiting there. She was chewing gum. When Zhou Ze came out, she took the initiative to open a piece of chewing gum and put it into Zhou Ze's mouth as if\n\n\n\n\"Boss, the money is back.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze’s point head\n\n\n\n\"Where is that girl?\" Bai Baobao didn't care about money. She sold more than one of her funeral items for this little money. She just cared about the girl's departure.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, her boss abused herself very much, so she was looking forward to how her boss treated the girl's\n\n\n\n\"At home.\" Zhou Ze began to prepare for a car\n\n\n\n\"I died at home,\" Bai Baobao asked\n\n\n\n\"What's wrong with her?\" Zhou Ze replied\n\n\n\n\"Why?\" Bai Baobao was puzzled, \"That kind of woman should be punished.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not what I should do,\" Zhou Cheng said calmly\"Boss, you're so jealous\"\n\n\n\n\"The teacher said it doesn't matter to me, so I'm going to make trouble for myself.\"\n\n\n\nAs he said, Zhou Ze stretched out his finger and pointed to the surrounding flower gardens and continued:\n\n\n\n\"Again, I don't know how many red eyes are hidden here, waiting for me to make a mistake.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze is not sure what the person in Rongcheng will be in the future, and he is not sure. Xiao Luoli may have joined forces with other ghost messengers to suppress him. Even the faceless woman on Huangquan Road was released to participate in this operation.\n\n\n\nOf course, because he owed the other party a favor in his dream, Zhou Ze hoped that he could survive this incident safely\n\n\n\nHowever, if he can't just be a judge if he learns himself\n\n\n\nHe was a doctor in his previous life. He only saved people, but did not kill people.\n\n\n\n  Bai Bao returned to the store by car. Along the way, Bai Bao didn't say a word. Obviously, she was very dissatisfied with Zhou Cheng's rehabilitation.\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to the bookstore, Zhou Ze saw the middle-aged man still sitting there reading a book. He didn't run. Even if Zhou Ze said he wanted to send him into the ground, he still didn't run.\n\n\n\n\"Pour me a glass of water.\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Baobao\n\n\n\n\"I'm tired, go and rest.\" Bai Baobao snorted and sat down directly behind the cabinet.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sat down in front of the middle-aged man without saying anything\n\n\n\n\"Who else is there in your house?\"\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man spoke and raised his head, \"The parents have passed away, only one sister.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tell me the way your sister contacts me, or tell me the address\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took out his mobile phone, clicked a video, and the sound was emitted from it:\n\n\n\n\"Or, I'm shouting now, saying that you are planning to enter the house illegally,..., and then my parents will hear my voice coming, the neighbors will come, and there will be someone to call the police, and you will be disgraced...\"\n\n\n\nThe scenes at that time were recorded in the mobile video\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man had slightly lip, a little excited and confused, and then hesitated in the battle:\n\n\n\n\"If this is announced, it will ruin her life.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then, who is responsible for your life and the kindness of the schools you have connected to and your relatives and wives,\" Zhou Cheng said indifferently, \"and you are responsible for the reputation of the teacher.\"\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man looked stunted and then pointed, \"Okay, I'll tell you my sister's address.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the middle-aged man revealed his address, his body gradually became virtualized and gradually seemed to be integrated into the underground.\n\n\n\nI have finished reading the book,\n\n\n\nThe thought was over,\n\n\n\nHe didn't need Zhou Ze's forced delivery, so he went into the ground and went to the ground.\n\n\n\nA true book reader, you can walk wildly\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sent the video to Bai Bao, and Bai Bao said with a surprise: \"Boss, as long as his sister handed this video to the police, he should not have to wear a hat when walking on Huangquan Road.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ha...\" Zhou Ze smiled, \"I can't take off the hat.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why did this happen? This incident turned around.\" Bai Baobao was a little confused, \"Justice is in the hearts of people.\"\n\n\n\n\"Usually, the news clicks and discussions about a firefighter's death on the Internet are far more than the news of a pet dog being abused.\"\n\n\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Bai Baobao obviously didn't understand. She just came into contact with the network and only played some single game games.\n\n\n\n\"You know, what do people pay attention to when it comes to something?\"\n\n\n\n\"For example, this matter must be the truth of the matter.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, people only care whether the 'truth' they see is interesting\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze stretched out his finger and pointed at the top.\n\n\n\n\"It is still unknown how many people who put him on that hat will see the news of the reversal. Even if a small number of them see it, you guess what reaction will they have.\"\n\n\n\n\"Shame, hard to bear\"\n\n\n\n\"If you do something wrong face to face and be criticized by others in person, normal people will feel guilty and difficult.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's right?\"\n\n\n\n\"But with a screen, most people usually have only one reaction.\"\n\n\n\n\"What reaction?\"\n\n\n\n  \"oh\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh.\" Bai Baobao didn't understand and asked, \"And what?\"\n\n\n\n\"Then should you fuck me?\"",

    "content": "The sister-in-law's wallet was sent back by Zhou Ze via an anonymous package.\n\nHm.\n\nPostage was cash on delivery.\n\nZhou Ze had swiped the two thousand yuan that was originally inside. Anyway, the girl had plenty of pocket money, so he'd just consider it his service fee for finding her wallet. Zhou Ze felt his fee was very reasonable.\n\nThe next day, Zhou Ze saw a social media post from his sister-in-law:\n\n\"This thief has such professional ethics, he stole my wallet but mailed back all my cards and IDs. There really are more good people than bad in this world.\"\n\nZhou Ze read the post and fell silent for a moment.\n\nForget it. It's better for the silly girl to stay silly. Fortune favors fools.\n\nBai Yingying secretly delivered the USB drive with the trimmed video to the middle-aged man's sister's home. The sister reported it to the police station that very day. A few days later, the local police's official Weibo account also published the news.\n\nThe matter caused quite a stir, with many people denouncing the girl for her shamelessness and heartlessness. However, the level of public interest was nowhere near what it had been when the incident first broke.\n\nBesides, the people cursing the girl now were probably the same ones who had called the teacher a \"beast in fine clothes\" back then.\n\nIn short, several days passed in peace and quiet. Business remained as slow as ever. Bai Yingying became even more immersed in the internet, improving at a rapid pace, and she also began to get hooked on online games. She could spend ages every day just sitting there reading guides for dungeon raids.\n\nA textbook internet-addicted girl.\n\nAt dusk, as usual, he ate at Xu Qinglang's place, pairing the meal with Xu Qinglang's newly developed strawberry juice.¹\n\nZhou Ze felt that he was gradually starting to be able to taste some flavor in his food.\n\nAfter the meal, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang split a cigarette as was their custom.\n\nXu Qinglang held his phone, scrolling through Weibo, carefree and relaxed.\n\nZhou Ze had noticed that Xu Qinglang's restaurant business was getting slower and slower lately, with fewer and fewer delivery drivers coming and going. Of course, this wasn't because business was bad or the restaurant's reputation was declining, but simply because the man in front of him was getting lazier and lazier.\n\nBut according to Xu Qinglang, the problem lay with Zhou Ze.\n\nHe himself toiled from dawn till dusk, while his neighbor just sat in his bookstore without moving a muscle. How could he possibly feel balanced?\n\nPlease, he was a man with over twenty properties!\n\nWhy was his life less comfortable than the poor devil's next door?\n\nSo, he decided he should also live well, enjoy himself, and rest when he should.\n\nHe's become decadent.\n\nZhou Ze sighed to himself.\n\n\"Hey, there have been a lot of strange things happening in the East District lately,\" Xu Qinglang said, blowing out a smoke ring.\n\nThe East District was on the east side of Tongcheng's urban area, a bit far from the city center. The Confucian Temple and the City God Temple were both located there. It was usually only lively during holidays, as many people went to burn incense.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked, flicking his cigarette ash.\n\n\"Look at this one. Someone posted on Weibo that last night while passing the Confucian Temple, they saw some enthusiasts doing historical costume cosplay. When they went over to say hello, the people suddenly vanished.\"\n\n\"And there's this one. Someone said they were taking a walk with their parents in the woods behind Confucian Temple Street after dinner and saw people there reciting poetry and composing couplets.\"\n\n\"And another one, from a driver, who said he heard a lot of people crying by the roadside as he drove past the Confucian Temple area.\"\n\nThe Confucian Temple?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. This matter seemed to have something to do with him.\n\n\"But these incidents have actually made the Confucian Temple popular again. They say the number of people going to burn incense has increased recently, all saying the place has become more spiritually potent,\" Xu Qinglang remarked with a sigh.\n\n\"Heh,\" Zhou Ze was contemplating his own business.\n\n\"Logically, that shouldn't happen. The Confucian Temple is where the Confucian sages reside; there shouldn't be any lonely souls or wandering ghosts causing trouble there,\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"There probably are, but someone might have been managing them before,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What about now? What happened to the person managing them?\"\n\n\"I killed him.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n---\n\nLeft with no choice, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying went to the Confucian Temple after nightfall.\n\nThe last time Zhou Ze was here, he had beaten the dwarf elder until his soul dissipated, then dusted off his sleeves and left without taking so much as a cloud with him.\n\nBut based on recent events, it was clear: without the dwarf elder's control, the souls of the scholars who had previously served as his honor guard were starting to get restless, gradually letting themselves go.\n\nZhou Ze was a Ghost Emissary; this matter was his responsibility to begin with. Not to mention, he was the one who had gotten rid of the dwarf elder. It was indeed his mess to clean up.\n\n\"Boss, these souls can't really amount to much. They'll probably vanish into thin air in a couple of months. Before, they were only sustained by the Confucian Temple's system. As long as they didn't cause trouble, the Ghost Emissaries would turn a blind eye and not bother with them.\n\nNow that they've lost their restraints, once they've had a few days to frolic and vent their grievances, those who are meant to dissipate will dissipate, and those who are meant to go to Hell will go to Hell.\"\n\nHaving been taught by Lady Bai's words and example, Bai Yingying actually had a clearer understanding of these ghostly matters than Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I can't rest easy without checking on the situation here. It's best to collect them all if I can,\" Zhou Ze said, tilting his head slightly, searching for any lingering scholar souls nearby.\n\nThe souls of generations of scholars who had failed to pass the imperial examinations or had taken their own lives due to setbacks on their academic path, many of them came to the vicinity of the Confucian Temple bearing great resentment. They were then drawn in by the ambient energy and became the temple's \"honor guard.\"\n\nOf course, there were surely others mixed in to make up the numbers; they couldn't all have been so-called scholars. After all, when the forest is large, it will have all kinds of birds.\n\nThose scholars mostly just recited poetry, composed couplets, and wept. Li Baojia of the Qing Dynasty once wrote in the sixth chapter of his *A Brief History of Civilization*:\n\n\"A scholar's rebellion won't succeed in three years. Regardless of whether they are involved or not, they can be ignored.\"\n\nBut what worried Zhou Ze was that if other entities had also been \"freed,\" they might cause some real trouble. If something did happen, when it came time to assign blame, he would certainly have to bear some of the responsibility.\n\nBut tonight was quiet. Zhou Ze had already smoked half a pack of cigarettes, and Bai Yingying had simply lain down on the grass with her eyes closed. Not a single ghost was to be seen.\n\nGrowing a bit impatient, Zhou Ze reached out and slapped Bai Yingying on her plump, round rear, watching the flesh ripple.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Shout a couple of times, lure those ghosts out.\"\n\nBai Yingying rolled her eyes at Zhou Ze, clearly ignoring his request. Having spent a long time together, she had figured out some of Zhou Ze's personality and habits, and dared to put on just the right amount of airs without annoying him.\n\n\"Life is but a dream; let me offer a cup to the moon on the river. My spirit wanders through my old homeland, but things are truly not what they once were.\"\n\nA man's voice came from behind a tree.\n\nFollowing that, a man wearing tall boots and an official's robe walked out. He had a long beard signifying authority, a square face, and a straight posture. At a glance, you could tell he was an official.\n\nNo, at a glance, you could tell he was someone who had been an official when he was alive.\n\nAnd he had a long queue hanging down his back.\n\nBai Yingying slowly stood up, looked at the man before her, and said in surprise:\n\n\"Boss, no wonder we couldn't find any of those scholar souls tonight. It turns out he's swallowed them all!\"\n\nZhou Ze could see it too. This man appeared to have a remarkable presence, but inside his belly, one could see many small points of light, which must have been the scholar souls he had swallowed.\n\n\"Heh heh, a prime minister's belly is big enough to sail a boat in. I am no prime minister, but I once held the rank of one of the Nine Ministers. This stomach of mine has no problem holding these washed-up failures of the imperial examinations.\"\n\n\"Alright, it's you then. Down you go.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to open the Gates of Hell and drag this fellow down.\n\nThe man had indeed swallowed many scholar souls and looked to be in good spirits, far better than the usual souls who frequented his bookstore.\n\nBut he was hardly at a level that would make Zhou Ze wary.\n\nThey were all ghosts, but having a physical body or not truly made a world of difference.\n\nBesides, he still had his fingernails.\n\n\"Are you the local Ghost Emissary?\" the man asked, looking at Zhou Ze with a reserved air. \"You do possess the qualification to stand on equal footing with this official.\"\n\n\"My, what a big talker. Has the Qing Dynasty fallen?\"² Bai Yingying scoffed.\n\n\"When men are speaking, is there room for a woman like you to interrupt? Step down for this official,\" the man scolded with considerable authority.\n\nBai Yingying cracked her knuckles, producing a series of crisp sounds.\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze, who was on the other side preparing to open the Gates of Hell, and said:\n\n\"Esteemed Emissary, this official has a scholarly title and once held great authority. Even if I am to be sent down, it shouldn't be done so casually, should it?\n\nMoreover, when this official was alive, I met a Netherworld Judge in the mortal realm. That Judge said this official would die on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jiashen year.\n\nThis official lived in fear, trembling day and night, and finally made it to that day. But after that day passed, this official did not die.\n\nThis is proof enough that this official is blessed by fate; even the rules of the Netherworld do not apply to me. Therefore, this official advises you not to waste your efforts.\n\nWhen this official has finished touring his homeland, if I wish to go down, I will naturally go down. Perhaps after I descend, I might even secure a supervisory position in the Netherworld. If we meet in the future, you will have to kneel and salute me, respectfully calling me 'Your Excellency'.\"\n\n\"You really are asking for a beating,\" Bai Yingying said with a smile.\n\n\"No, this just proves that the customs in his hometown are simple and honest. Otherwise, he wouldn't have lived to adulthood without being beaten to death.\"\n\n\"How outrageous! Hmph, this official cannot be bothered to engage in such verbal sparring with you lot. This official has not spoken falsely. If you intend to forcibly escort this official to Hell, then be prepared to make an enemy of me.\n\nEven a Netherworld Judge could not determine the date of this official's death. What makes you think a mere Ghost Emissary like you can?\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to open the Gates of Hell anymore. He found the man before him rather interesting. And to be honest, modern ghosts were nothing special, but ancient ghosts...\n\n...were a real rarity.\n\nPeople often say that precious artifacts are records of history. The man before him was a true, living repeater of history.\n\n\"You have a queue hanging down your head, but the official robe you're wearing is not from the Qing dynasty,\" Zhou Ze said after a moment of careful observation. \"It should be a Ming dynasty official robe.\n\nNo, that's not right. You just said you once held the rank of one of the Nine Ministers, but this Ming dynasty robe is not the kind worn by the Nine Ministers. On the contrary, it's the attire of a low-ranking official.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the man said proudly, \"This official served in two dynasties. An Imperial Censor in the former dynasty, and one of the Nine Ministers in the latter. I brought fortune to the people, and my official reputation was renowned.\n\nAs for what clothes this official wears, what right do you have to comment?\"\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, typed in \"Jiashen year, third month, nineteenth day\" to search, and then smiled.\n\n\"That Judge wasn't wrong. You should have died on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jiashen year.\"\n\n\"Utter nonsense! This official did not die on that day. I eventually died of old age and was granted a beautiful posthumous title!\" the man said with great disdain.\n\n\"You were supposed to die that day, really,\" Zhou Ze repeated, a mocking smile appearing on his face. \"But you shamelessly refused to die.\"\n\n\"Arrogant words!\" The man flicked his sleeve. \"Utterly senseless!\"\n\n\"Think again about what day the nineteenth of the third month of the Jiashen year really is, and whether or not you should have died!\"\n\nZhou Ze's tone grew heavier as he reprimanded him.\n\nThe man frowned slightly, seeming to ponder and recall.\n\nFinally,\n\nsuddenly,\n\nhis body trembled, and a look of shock appeared on his face.\n\nThen he glanced back at the Confucian Temple behind him.\n\nIn that moment,\n\nhe finally understood why, after his death, his soul had returned to his homeland only to be detained within this Confucian Temple, spending hundreds of years in a daze alongside those he called \"examination failures\"!\n\n\"This... this... this...\"\n\nThe man sat down on the ground, utterly dejected.\n\nThe nineteenth day of the third month of the Jiashen year.\n\nThat was the day the Ming dynasty fell, the day Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill, the day the officials of the Ming court were expected to follow their sovereign in death.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Strawberry Juice (草妹汁):** The original text uses `草妹汁` (cǎo mèi zhī).

    "content": "The man was silent. For a moment, he was lost in a daze.\n\nZhou Ze had originally thought he would become a vengeful ghost, just like the souls of the victims who had been burned to death by the delivery boy back in his bookstore.\n\nThe existence of ghosts, once transformed into vengeful ones, meant their obsession had completely solidified, severing their path to reincarnation. The only possible end was to vanish into thin air.\n\nIt was a bit like a person taking a hundred times the normal dose of a stimulant in a short period. Of course, they’d get high as a kite. And of course, after the high wore off, it would be time to collect the body.\n\nHowever, the man before him seemed rather calm.\n\nVery lost, very bewildered, very helpless, and also very conflicted.\n\nHe turned to look at the Confucian Temple behind him and sighed. \"So, as someone who grew up reading the books of the sages, in their eyes, am I really no different from those down-and-out scholars who failed the imperial examinations?\"\n\nHe had thought he was unique, believed he was blessed by fortune, that even a Ghost Adjudicator couldn't determine his fate. Who knew that in the end, it was all just his own inflated self-importance.\n\nActually, he should have realized it long ago. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been detained here for several hundred years, muddle-headed day after day, unable to even maintain self-awareness, only able to follow one generation of night watchmen after another, circling the Confucian Temple.\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze. \"Do you think I deserved to die?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"I had a good friend, surnamed Liu. After learning that the former emperor had hanged himself on Meishan,¹ he led his entire family, young and old, to commit suicide in their residence to follow the emperor in death.\"\n\nThe man recounted the story softly.\n\n\"The day before it happened, his granddaughter, who was only thirteen, secretly ran to my residence, hoping for my protection. Her mother was a concubine and wanted to find a chance for her to live.\n\nThen my old friend came to my door personally and took his granddaughter back.\n\nIn the end, the entire Liu family, more than twenty people, hanged themselves to die for their country. That little granddaughter, however, was stabbed to death with a treasured sword. She didn't want to die, but she died all the same.\"\n\nThe man smiled faintly. \"Do you think what he did was right?\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze didn't remain silent. He said, \"She shouldn't have died.\"\n\n\"Yes, she shouldn't have died. So I feel that when it comes to life and death, everyone has their own calculations. I knew my relatives didn't want to die, and my children didn't want to die either. So, I had to grit my teeth and live. To survive.\n\nI wasn't just living for myself; I had to live for this big family of theirs.\n\nFurthermore, during my service in the subsequent dynasty, I saved countless lives and reduced a great deal of slaughter.\n\nIt's like how after the Xuanwu Gate Incident, Li Shimin knew he was destined to have an indelible stain on his name in history, so he exhausted himself to be a wise and good emperor.\n\nAt the time, I had the same mentality.\n\nI always felt that if I did more good deeds, saved more people, then even if I failed to die for my country, I had at least preserved a useful body to do things beneficial for the nation and its people. That could be considered making up for my transgressions in another way.\"\n\nThe man said a lot, clearly unconvinced by his fate.\n\nScholars in ancient times called themselves disciples of the sages because they read the sages' books and studied their principles. But now, it was obvious that the sages in the Confucian Temple had branded him an unworthy disciple.\n\nHe had been one of the Nine Ministers, a man of high rank, yet his treatment after death was the same as those who had committed suicide in the Confucian Temple after failing their examinations.\n\nThis, in itself, demonstrated the sages' attitude.\n\nZhou Ze slowly crouched down, looked at the man before him, thought for a moment, and finally said, \"What you just said sounds a bit familiar. Less than a hundred years ago, someone said something quite similar to what you did.\n\nHis name was Wang Jixin.\n\nAt a time of national crisis, he became a traitor, aiding the enemy, all under the fine-sounding name of 'saving the country through a roundabout path'.\"²\n\nThe man's mouth fell slightly open. He wanted to say something but didn't know where to begin.\n\n\"You went from being a Censor in the former dynasty to one of the Nine Ministers in the next. You don't need to make any more excuses for yourself.\n\nThe most fundamental reason is actually very simple.\n\nThe water was too cold.\"³\n\nUpon hearing this, a look of shame and anger appeared on the man's face, and he glared furiously at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze spread his hand, his nails grew long, and then he drew forth the symbol on his right palm, tracing a circle. The Gate of Hell opened.\n\n\"Please. What you want, isn't it just a bit of dignity? Walk in yourself.\n\nIf I have to personally grab you, then even that last shred of dignity will be gone.\"\n\nThe man stood up and walked forward step by step. Before stepping through the gate, he gave Zhou Ze one last look, his eyes filled with deep meaning.\n\n\"Do you think the water is cold or not?\"\n\n\"As long as your conscience is clear.\"\n\nThe man showed a contemplative expression, then shook his head. It was unclear if he had finally figured it out or not, but in the end, he took that step and walked through the door.\n\nWith a wave of Zhou Ze's hand, the gate dissipated. Everything here was finished.\n\nIt seemed he also had to thank that official. By swallowing all the nearby scholar ghosts, he had saved Zhou Ze a lot of trouble.\n\n\"Boss, is that it?\" the female corpse said with great disappointment. \"I thought you were going to give him a beating.\"\n\n\"Beating him or not is meaningless,\" Zhou Ze said, casting a deep glance at the Confucian Temple not far ahead. \"Besides, the sages in the Confucian Temple have already detained him here for several hundred years. He's been punished enough.\"\n\nBai Yingying pouted. \"Looks like these clay statues in the Confucian Temple are somewhat useful after all. They're not completely blind.\"\n\n\"Yeah. They detained the soul of that former Censor here because they felt he wasn't their disciple, that he'd done something shameless and lost them face, so he needed to be punished.\n\nThey punished him.\n\nThen, the dynasty changed. The Ming became the Qing. Many things changed, but the Confucian Temple remained the Confucian Temple. These masterly clay statues of the sages continued to enjoy the incense offerings of the new dynasty.\"\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying was speechless.\n\n\"Boss, you're sounding more and more philosophical these days. So are the clay statues in the temple good things or bad things?\"\n\nBai Yingying still remembered the last time she had helped someone snatch the first incense offering and entered the Confucian Temple, only to feel the uncomfortable sensation of being \"watched.\"\n\n\"They're just things, I guess.\"\n\n---\n\nHe took a cab, and by the time he got back to the bookstore, it was already ten at night. But usually, this was when Zhou Ze's real business hours began.\n\nProbably because there were fewer ghosts during the day and they were more active at night.\n\nHe had earned a bit of Hell money these past few days, but after giving away that video last time, Zhou Ze had burned a lot of it to avoid trouble.\n\nThat video, of course, couldn't be used as direct evidence. But as long as it made the relevant authorities aware of the truth of the matter, with a little effort to investigate seriously, the truth wouldn't be hard to uncover.\n\nThe video was merely a lead; it couldn't be used as actual evidence.\n\nZhou Ze didn't read. Instead, he put on his headphones, listened to music, and casually browsed some news. Bai Yingying sat behind him, playing a game on her phone.\n\nMaster and servant, each enjoying their own pastime. In the eyes of the man next door, who was more beautiful than a woman, this was a sign of degeneracy!\n\nLate at night, the bookstore door was pushed open. A girl walked in, leading a Corgi.\n\nA familiar girl, a familiar Corgi.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and poured her a glass of water. As his number one VIP customer, she naturally deserved this service.\n\nZhou Ze also leaned in for a closer look.\n\nThe person was alive.\n\nThe dog was also alive.\n\nHonestly, the probability of a living person entering his bookstore in the dead of night was quite low.\n\n\"Boss, I found my doggy.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe Corgi excitedly circled Zhou Ze twice, then happily bounded over to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying was playing *Honor of Kings*⁴ when she was suddenly startled by the dog. She immediately shot it a glare. The Corgi froze in terror.\n\nAs the saying goes, a dog looks down on people, but in reality, a dog can see things people can't.\n\nInstantly, the dog collapsed onto the floor, its bladder and bowels letting go all at once.\n\n\"Sorry, sorry, I'm so sorry, Boss,\" the girl immediately stood up, preparing to clean up.\n\n\"It's fine.\" Zhou Ze gestured for the girl to relax, then said to Bai Yingying, \"Clean it up.\"\n\nBai Yingying put down her phone and, with a mournful expression, went to the bathroom to get a mop and a rag.\n\n\"Boss, business at this bookstore has never been that great, has it?\" the girl said, pulling her dog back and keeping it by her feet, not letting it run around anymore.\n\nOf course, the poor thing didn't dare run around anymore. It barely dared to breathe.\n\n\"Just getting by,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Last time, thanks so much for telling me my dog's location. I was able to find the person who took him and pay to get him back.\"\n\n\"How much did it cost?\"\n\n\"Over ten thousand. The person didn't want to give him back, said she was raising him. But after we agreed on a price, she returned the dog to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Boss, I think you could add more things to this bookstore. For example, these chairs are really uncomfortable. You could switch them out for sofas.\"\n\n*If I had the money, I'd want to as well.*\n\n\"How about I invest? You could fix this place up nicely,\" the girl said to Zhou Ze, stroking her dog's head.\n\nZhou Ze knew she just wanted to repay him, so she didn't mind taking a loss just for fun. But Zhou Ze couldn't agree.\n\nHe couldn't very well ask her, *Do you mind receiving your dividends in Hell money?*\n\n*Hell money that you can burn to accumulate yin virtue?*\n\nWhen that Taoist priest had said that to him back then, Zhou Ze had thought the man was a moron.\n\nWell,\n\nZhou Ze didn't want the girl in front of him to think he was a moron too.\n\nJust then, a loud laugh came from the noodle shop next door. Immediately after, Xu Qinglang, dressed in alluring pajamas, ran out. He came into the bookstore and shouted at Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying, who was wiping up dog poop:\n\n\"I won! The lottery, I won! One hundred thousand!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was overjoyed. When people are happy, they always want to share. The only place nearby where he could find living people was the bookstore next door.\n\nAlthough, it seemed the two in the bookstore next door weren't living people either...\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Zhou Ze offered.\n\n\"Tsk tsk, buy me a handbag, Boss Xu,\" Bai Yingying seized the opportunity to get a little celebratory gift.\n\n\"A small matter, a small matter,\" Xu Qinglang began to act demure. Then he saw that there was a young, beautiful girl nearby and immediately became even more demure.\n\n\"It's only a hundred thousand yuan. After taxes, it's just eighty thousand. It's just a little prize money. For someone like me, who has over twenty resettlement apartments in Shiqiao District, it's just a drop in the bucket. It won't have any real impact on my life.\"\n\n\"Shiqiao District?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"That's right,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nShiqiao District was close to the city center, so property prices there were higher than elsewhere. Naturally, this gave him more right to show off—oh, no, to be more *subtle*.\n\n\"Oh, that's probably my family's residential complex then.\"\n\n\"Your family lives there too?\" Xu Qinglang's smile grew even wider. \"Maybe we can get coffee together sometime?\"\n\n\"My family doesn't live there.\"\n\n\"Then what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, the company that demolished your old place and gave you the resettlement housing... that was probably my family's company.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\n---\n¹ **Meishan (Coal Hill):** The hill in Beijing where the Chongzhen Emperor, the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, hanged himself in 1644 as rebel forces entered the city. This event marks the end of the Ming Dynasty.\n\n² **'Saving the country through a roundabout path' (曲線救國主義):** A phrase famously used by Wang Jingwei to justify his collaborationist government with the Japanese Empire during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It has since become a euphemism for treason under a patriotic guise. The name in the text, Wang Jixin, is a slight alteration of the historical figure's name, Wang Jingwei (汪精衛).\n\n³ **'The water was too cold' (水太涼):** A famous historical anecdote referring to Qian Qianyi, a high-ranking Ming Dynasty official. After the fall of the Ming, he allegedly planned to commit suicide by drowning to show his loyalty but gave up after dipping his hand in the water and declaring it \"too cold.\" The phrase is now a widely understood symbol of cowardice and making flimsy excuses to avoid sacrifice.\n\n⁴ ***Honor of Kings* (農藥):** The original text uses the slang term \"農藥\" (nóngyào), which means \"pesticide.\" It's a pun on the name of the popular mobile game *Honor of Kings* (王者榮耀, Wángzhě Róngyào), as Róngyào sounds similar to nóngyào.",

    "content": "This was perhaps the time Xu Qinglang had been hurt the most.\n\nMen like to show off in front of the opposite sex, bragging and gloating, just like a gorilla beating its chest during a mating ritual, constantly letting out:\n\n\"Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh!\"\n\nTo Zhou Ze, the fawning look on Xu Qinglang's face seemed to be the first time he'd ever seen him attempt to send out that kind of mating signal.\n\nUnfortunately, the girl's words: \"Your apartment is a resettlement unit from my family's company.\"\n\n*Snap!*\n\nIt was as if something had shattered.\n\nXu Qinglang looked like he wanted to clutch his chest and drop to his knees.\n\nPain.\n\nSo painful.\n\nHeart-wrenching pain.\n\nThe girl slowly stood up and said to Zhou Ze, \"Boss, let's add each other on WeChat. If you're interested in collaborating in the future, you can contact me.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Zhou Ze, naturally, didn't refuse.\n\nAfter adding him on WeChat, the girl left, leading her corgi away.\n\nXu Qinglang let out a long sigh, waved his hand, and slowly turned to leave the bookstore.\n\nHe needed some time to nurse his wounds.\n\nA smile crept onto Zhou Ze's lips. It seemed that for the next little while, at least, the words \"twenty-some apartments\" wouldn't be coming out of Xu Qinglang's mouth again.\n\nTurning around, Zhou Ze saw Bai Yingying sitting on a plastic stool, spacing out. No, not spacing out—to be precise, she was reading a copy of *Those Happenings in the Ming Dynasty*.\n\n\"Boss, what did you mean when you said 'the water is too cold' to that ghost?\"\n\nThe female corpse's memories were largely inherited from Madam Bai. In that era, the variety of books women read was actually quite limited; it was naturally impossible for them to be as \"learned as five cartloads of books\" as the men who studied for the imperial examinations.\n\nAs for the gathering of talented women in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, that could probably only happen in a book.\n\n\"He was a literary leader in the late Ming Dynasty, and I think he was also the Minister of Rites. When the Qing army broke through the pass and the Ming Dynasty was on the verge of collapse, he prepared to die for his country. His beloved concubine, Liu Rushi, was ready to die with him. In the end, his concubine jumped in, but he never dared to, saying, 'The water is too cold.' He ultimately surrendered to the Manchu Qing.\"\n\n\"Then that man is a real piece of work. Boss, were you using that to mock the ghost?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"Actually, although Qian Qianyi did surrender to the Qing in the end, he secretly funded anti-Qing forces and passed information to the anti-Qing army. He was even called to account for it by the Qing court.\"\n\n\"That...\" Bai Yingying didn't know how to judge this person.\n\nShe was very simple, like the elderly or children watching a TV show, who like to ask bluntly, \"Is this person good? Is this person bad?\"\n\nFor many people, the world is either black or white. As for the gray areas, they are too complicated, too difficult to understand, so they simply pretend not to see them.\n\n\"The one I just threw into Hell was, in essence, quite similar to Qian Qianyi.\" Zhou Ze smiled, picked up his teacup, and sat down on the chair behind the counter.\n\n\"Then why did you still send him to Hell?\" Bai Yingying asked, a bit confused. \"At the very least, you could have turned a blind eye and let him stay in the mortal world a while longer, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Are you starting to feel sorry for him?\"\n\n\"'The water is too cold'—it's only human nature.\" Bai Yingying pouted. \"I'm dead now, a jiangshi. If I were still alive, I think choosing not to die for the monarch and the court should be my own choice. To die, of course, deserves praise, but not to die is also understandable.\"\n\n\"The Ghost Adjudicator was right when he said he should have died on that day.\" Zhou Ze put down his cup. \"I was originally dead myself, and then came back by possessing a corpse. I'm essentially struggling to survive, so I shouldn't have the right to ask someone else whether they ought to die. Don't you think so too?\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded.\n\n\"To understand anything, you need to consider it within its specific context. To think about ancient people, to think about their ways of behavior, you must place yourself in that era, within the context of its culture, customs, and so on.\n\n\"From a modern perspective, of course, we see a picture of ethnic harmony where all are one big family of the Chinese nation.\n\n\"But if you put it in the late Ming Dynasty, everyone ought to have their own respective stance.\n\n\"Your way of thinking is like an ancient farmer assuming the emperor eats ten youtiao and ten big meat buns for breakfast every day. It's fundamentally wrong and inappropriate for us to use our own small-fry mentality to understand those great figures in history.\n\n\"Yes, Qian Qianyi did do many things to help the anti-Qing army after surrendering, and even mocked the Qing Dynasty in the documents he compiled. But for him, that was not nearly enough.\"\n\n\"Not enough? Did he really have to die?\" Bai Yingying asked, perplexed.\n\n\"He had to die,\" Zhou Ze answered very seriously. \"Including the ghost I just threw down—he had to die too!\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\n\"Or he could choose not to die. He could have left without a care, become a wealthy gentleman, and disappeared completely from the world, abandoning his glory and riches to live in obscurity. That would have been acceptable too.\"\n\n\"On what grounds?\" Bai Yingying clearly disagreed. \"Everyone's life should be in their own hands.\"\n\n\"When Dodo's army marched into Nanjing, Qian Qianyi was the highest-ranking official in the city. He led the officials to kneel and welcome the Qing army into the city, surrendering to the Manchus.\n\n\"He could not surrender. He had no right to surrender.\n\n\"His prestige, his status, his authority, his position, his enjoyments, his exceptional treatment—all of it was given to him by the imperial court. You could also say it was given to him by the state.\n\n\"However many benefits you receive is how much responsibility you ought to bear.\n\n\"You received so much from the state, reaching the pinnacle of officialdom. Even when you were so old your back could barely move, you still pursued Liu Rushi, a case of 'a pear blossom pressing upon a crabapple,'¹ living so freely.\n\n\"So when the state needed him, he naturally and rightly had an obligation to fulfill his duty.\n\n\"This is a kind of... contractual spirit.\n\n\"'When the nation is in peril, every man has a duty.' In reality, even if the common folk just looked up,\n\n\"at the sky,\n\n\"no one would blame them.\n\n\"But for those officials of old who fed on government stipends and enjoyed the fat of the land, they themselves had an obligation to do everything in their power to right the ship of state when it was about to sink, or even to go down with the ship.\n\n\"It's hard to be a hero, but easy to be a villain. We should applaud and praise heroes, not put ourselves in the shoes of villains to make excuses for them.\n\n\"It's never been a case of, 'I can't be a hero, so being a villain is understandable.' It's never been like that.\"\n\nListening to this, Bai Yingying nodded, seeming to half-understand.\n\n\"Take the one from the Confucian Temple, for example. In the Ming Dynasty, he was an Imperial Censor, similar to a modern-day prosecutor—and not even a chief prosecutor. But later he became one of the Nine Ministers, which is like a cabinet minister today.\n\n\"After surrendering, he still managed to do so well, rising through the ranks. Tell me, should he have died or not?\n\n\"A high official in the Ming Dynasty once declared, 'The state has nurtured its scholars for one hundred and fifty years. The day to uphold integrity and die for righteousness is today.' This is the principle I'm talking about.\"\n\n\"My head is spinning,\" Bai Yingying said, shaking her head.\n\n\"This is a bookstore. Although there are mostly novels, you can read other books too.\" Zhou Ze cracked his neck. \"It's not like you have anything else to do.\"\n\nBai Yingying glanced at Zhou Ze, her look implying, *As if you have anything to do either.*\n\nZhou Ze got up, went to the restroom to wash his face, and came out to see Bai Yingying refilling his teacup. She asked again:\n\n\"Oh, right, Boss, what happened to that high official who declared, 'The state has nurtured its scholars for one hundred and fifty years'?\"\n\n\"Oh, the emperor had the Jinyiwei beat him severely with cudgels in front of the Zuo Shun Gate.\"\n\nZhou Ze sniffled.\n\n\"And then there was no 'after that'.\"\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying was speechless.\n\nFor a rare moment, the master and servant had a bout of artistic pretension, discussing history and worldviews.\n\nOf course, this fine atmosphere didn't last long, because the female corpse immediately dropped her book, picked up her phone, and started playing *Honor of Kings*.\n\nBut then another customer came into the store. He was a middle-aged man, about forty-something, wearing a black down jacket. His face was a bit rough, his clothes were somewhat worn, and he had an honest, simple look about him.\n\n\"Boss, can I post a notice here?\" the man asked Zhou Ze humbly.\n\n\"What kind of notice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A missing person notice,\" the man answered honestly.\n\n\"Go ahead.\" Zhou Ze got up and walked to the entrance, watching the man post the notice on the wall.\n\n\"No picture?\" Zhou Ze asked, seeing that the notice had only text and no photo.\n\n\"She was just a baby when she was adopted, only a few months old. We don't have a picture.\" The man rubbed his hands together and offered Zhou Ze a cigarette. \"Don't mind that it's a cheap one.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette and asked, \"Was she abducted?\"\n\n\"No, she was given up for adoption. We already had her older sister, and back then there was no second-child policy. I couldn't afford the fine and was afraid of losing my job, so we had no choice but to give her to someone else to raise. All these years, we've thought about her day and night, hoping to see her again. But we haven't been in contact, since she was given to another family. As long as they treat her well, that's all that matters. It wouldn't be right for us to disturb her; it wouldn't be good for her.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This time... it's her younger brother. He's had some bad luck and got leukemia. All I know is that the family who adopted her over a decade ago lived somewhere around here, so I can only try searching here. Her older sister wasn't a match, so now only she can save her brother's life. And it'll be a good chance for our family to be reunited.\"\n\n\"Younger brother?\" Zhou Ze frowned and asked, \"How old is she now?\"\n\n\"Seventeen.\"\n\n\"How old is her younger brother?\"\n\n\"Sixteen.\"\n\n\"How pitiful,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\"I know, right? How could a perfectly fine young kid get a disease like this? Boss, please keep an eye out for me. I'm going to go post more of these up ahead. I've already contacted the media, so there might be an interview tomorrow. I reckon we'll find her real soon. Then our family can be reunited, and her brother can be saved.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man gave another simple and honest smile, then headed on.\n\nAfter he had walked some distance and his figure had disappeared into the night,\n\nZhou Ze looked at the missing person notice on the wall by the entrance and said softly:\n\n\"How pitiful.\"\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze reached out,\n\nand tore the freshly posted notice right off the wall.\n***\n¹A line of poetry by Su Shi, famously used to mock an 80-year-old man for taking an 18-year-old concubine.

    "content": "The second daughter is seventeen this year, and the younger son is sixteen.\n\nIn other words, after sending his second daughter away, that simple and honest-looking middle-aged man, with a heart full of immense guilt and longing, immediately had another child with his wife.\n\nSo, all that talk about violating the family planning policy, the fines, and whatnot—it was all fake.\n\nHe just wanted a son. His first child was a daughter, and his second was also a daughter, so he simply gave her away and then, without stopping to catch a breath, conceived a new life.\n\nEven after giving her away, he didn't even know her adoptive family's address or have any contact information. It was obvious they had no intention of ever dealing with her again.\n\nFortunately for him, the next child was a son. Otherwise, he would have given away a third daughter, a fourth daughter...\n\nNow, because his son has leukemia and needs a match—and because the eldest daughter wasn't a match—it finally occurred to them:\n\n\"Oh, right, it seems we have another girl we gave away.\"\n\nAnd so, to save their son, they began their search.\n\nThey mobilized the media and put up missing person flyers.\n\nIf you want to move others, you must first move yourself. Humans are just that kind of emotional and complex being.\n\nIn the dozen or so years since their daughter was sent away, they might have felt a sliver of guilt, but they never regretted it. If they had, they would have started looking for her long ago. Besides, it would have been much easier to find her in the first few years after she was given away than it is now, over a decade later.\n\nIf you do something wrong that causes you pain, you will spend the following days constantly using psychological suggestion to alleviate or even erase that pain.\n\nThat middle-aged man did a very successful job of it. He wove many excuses. After repeating the lie a hundred times, he started to believe it himself.\n\nHe felt that he still loved and cared for his second daughter. He felt that giving her away back then was out of helplessness, a tragic necessity that could move heaven and earth, a decision he was forced into, just like in *The Orphan of Zhao*.[^1]\n\nThey wouldn't stop to think that the daughter they gave away is now seventeen years old;\n\nThat she should be in high school, with her own circle of friends, living a life no different from her peers;\n\nThat her adoptive parents might never have even told her she was adopted, that she believes they are her real parents.\n\nHer life ought to be very peaceful.\n\nBut soon, a bolt from the blue will strike her!\n\n\"Child, I have some happy news for you. We've found your birth parents!\"\n\n\"Child, I have some exciting news for you. The parents you've had until now aren't your real mom and dad!\"\n\n\"Child, I have some joyous news for you. You have an older sister and a younger brother!\"\n\n\"Child, I have something great to tell you. You can save your sick little brother!\"\n\nAren't you surprised?\nAren't you thrilled?\nAren't you touched?\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong?\" Bai Yingying asked, seeing Zhou Ze standing by the door in a daze.\n\n\"There's something that, every time I think about it, makes my skin crawl,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Don't be so dramatic, Boss. You've even been down to Hell. What could possibly scare you this much?\" Bai Yingying looked at Zhou Ze curiously.\n\n\"It's that for so many jobs, so many professions, so many positions, you need to be tested and certified to qualify. It's like getting a driver's license—you have to prove your skills are up to par, that you're familiar with traffic laws, and then they even make you drive on the road to see if you can pass a real-world test.\n\n\"Otherwise, letting someone with substandard driving skills and attitude get a license is actually irresponsible to the other pedestrians and drivers on the road.\"\n\n\"And?\" Bai Yingying pressed.\n\n\"But to be a parent, you don't need a license.\"\n\n...\n\nThe night passed without incident. The next morning, Zhou Ze woke up and, as was his habit, went to get a meal next door, but the door was closed.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a little worried. Could Xu Qinglang have been so devastated last night that he had completely lost heart?\n\nZhou Ze didn't care if he lost heart, but he couldn't live without those juices of his.\n\nHe called him, and Xu Qinglang answered quickly. It turned out he had gone to claim his lottery winnings and said he would buy everyone a small gift later to show his appreciation.\n\nWith no other choice, Zhou Ze ordered takeout and wolfed it down with the sour plum juice he still had at home.\n\nThe shop door was still closed. Although it wasn't locked, it was a clear sign of his lazy attitude toward doing business. Zhou Ze had long since learned to go with the flow.\n\nHowever, when he sat down in the chair behind the counter and opened the drawer, Zhou Ze was surprised to find a thick stack of nether money inside.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze thought Bai Yingying had deliberately bought some nether money to give him a little surprise, but on second thought, she probably wasn't that childish.\n\nHe took the nether money and flicked it with his finger. It was real.\n\nIsn't that funny...\n\nNowadays, with the convenience of mobile payments, the sight of people in shops or at the market holding large banknotes up to the sun and flicking them to check for authenticity was becoming rarer and rarer.\n\nBut this was real currency.\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment. It was probably his commission from sending that Lord Censor down yesterday. That man would later hold a position as high as the Nine Ministers during the Qing dynasty. His family was large and prosperous, so the filial offerings of incense from his descendants were naturally substantial.\n\nZhou Ze estimated that if he burned this nether money, people would probably drop several wallets at his doorstep. It should be worth at least five thousand yuan or more.\n\nThis time, it seemed he hadn't come out at a loss. He had earned over five thousand in a single night, and the only cost was the taxi fare there and back, which added up to less than a hundred yuan.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to go out and burn the joss paper. This nether money was useful in critical moments. It could help ward off minor disasters and avoid troublesome interference in certain matters. Sometimes, it was more effective than a few thousand yuan.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe voice called out before the person had even entered the shop.\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw his sister-in-law walk in.\n\n\"Here, for you.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law was carrying a shoulder bag today. She took out a stack of cash and placed it on Zhou Ze's counter.\n\n\"Paying you back.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"You could have just transferred it from your phone.\"\n\n\"No way. It feels more satisfying to slap down a stack of cash when you're paying someone back,\" his sister-in-law said with a pout.\n\nAfter the last incident, her opinion of Zhou Ze had improved somewhat. Of course, that was also because the old Xu Le had been too much of a wimp. He couldn't even control his own wife, so naturally, his sister-in-law looked down on him even more.\n\nBut now that Zhou Ze had a stern demeanor with her, putting on the airs of an elder, she actually started to take him seriously.\n\n\"Xu Le, your business is really terrible,\" his sister-in-law said with her hands in her pockets.\n\n\"No class today?\"\n\n\"It's the weekend,\" his sister-in-law pouted unhappily. \"But I'm going to a bar later. I told my sister I was coming here to read and do my homework, so don't you dare let it slip.\"\n\n*Your sister hasn't contacted me in half a month.*\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit wistful. He had thought that Dr. Lin's主动 embrace after he came clean that time was a good start, but perhaps it was just a moment of courage on her part.\n\nOnce a person calms down, their thoughts slowly become more complicated. Dr. Lin probably hadn't escaped that vicious cycle and mental block yet.\n\nThe legal husband she disliked was dead.\n\nThen the man she liked borrowed her legal husband's body to resurrect his soul.\n\nWhat looked like a win-win situation...\n\n...was separated by an insurmountable moral chasm.\n\nFortunately, after the incident with the Faceless Woman, Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry about this anymore.\n\nAt least the thought, *She's not sleeping with me anyway,* hadn't appeared in his mind for a long time.\n\nIt might also be because Bai Yingying had been sleeping with him every night recently.\n\nAlthough Bai Yingying was for looking, not for touching...\n\n...just being able to look was still nice.\n\n\"You should go to places like bars less often,\" Zhou Ze reminded her. \"It won't be too late to relax and do things you like after you get into university.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, you sound just like my parents and my sister. You're a university graduate yourself, how did you end up in this state?\"\n\nHer way of speaking...\n\n...to put it nicely, was straightforward.\n\n...to put it bluntly, was tactless.\n\nZhou Ze believed that when that wimp Xu Le finally made up his mind to hire someone to kill him, this sister-in-law constantly racking up his 'rage meter' on the side must have played an assisting role.\n\nIt seemed his sister-in-law didn't know about what happened with her female classmate, probably due to considerations for protecting a minor.\n\n\"I'm back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang returned, carrying a pile of things.\n\n\"I'm exhausted. It was so weird today, I couldn't hail a single taxi. I don't know if my luck was just terrible or if all the taxi drivers went to their annual company meeting.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put the things down and wiped his sweat.\n\nBai Yingying came over at that moment, and her eyes lit up when she saw the items on the floor.\n\nThey were computer components.\n\n\"I'll install it in my shop. You can come play whenever you want,\" Xu Qinglang said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang took out a bag for Bai Yingying and tossed a fancy lighter to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Here, spreading the love evenly!\"\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law wasn't interested in the gifts. What she was interested in was the plastic fan tucked into the back of Xu Qinglang's collar.\n\nWinter wasn't over yet. Carrying a fan was interesting.\n\n\"A group of people were doing a promotion at the mall, they shoved it into my hands,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nThe sister-in-law took the fan. It was a very ordinary plastic fan with \"GG\" printed on it. After looking at it, she couldn't help but let out a \"pfft\" of laughter.\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It has 'Where Are We Going, Dad?' printed on it,\" she replied.\n\n\"What's so funny about that? You have such a low bar for humor?\" Xu Qinglang reached for the fan, then his eyes widened.\n\n\"Perfect. You and my brother-in-law can go together,\" the sister-in-law said, shooting a mischievous glance at Xu Qinglang and Zhou Ze.\n\n\"The 'GG' version of *Where Are We Going, Dad*?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression was a mix of dark and light, but he still tossed the fan to Zhou Ze. \"See for yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the fan and glanced at it.\n\nThe background was a hospital building.\n\nAt the very top was a line of large characters: \"Where Are We Going, Dad?\"\n\nAnd below it were two lines in a cartoonish font:\n\n\"Let's take our sons to get circum... cised together!\n\nSecond one half price!\"\n\n---\n[^1]: *The Orphan of Zhao* is a famous Chinese play from the Yuan dynasty, considered one of the great classic tragedies.

You really can't find a single taxi.\"\n\nTossing the fan aside, Xu Qinglang stacked the items back up, preparing to go home and assemble his computer.\n\n\"Just bad luck, I guess.\" Zhou Ze didn't think much of it and walked to the storefront to light a cigarette.\n\nThe late morning sun still felt quite pleasant.\n\nBai Yingying didn't like sunlight, which was probably related to her identity and nature. However, she wasn't like the jiangshi in old Hong Kong movies who would turn to dust upon contact with the sun.\n\nAccording to Xu Qinglang, after being nourished by Madam Bai's soul for two hundred years, Bai Yingying was no longer an ordinary being. Although not as terrifying as a superweapon like a drought demon, she was far from being some low-level little jiangshi.\n\nAnd indeed, it was true. If Bai Yingying wanted to, she could completely change her identity and blend into urban life.\n\nBut her soul-blood was in his hands, so she couldn't leave. Besides, it seemed she didn't want to leave, either. Who knew if a random clap of thunder might strike her dead one day? After all, in the eyes of Heaven, she wasn't exactly a welcome guest.\n\n\"Smoke less. You're smoking way too much these days.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law also walked out of the shop, looking like she was about to go out and have fun.\n\nZhou Ze ignored her.\n\nTruthfully, Zhou Ze quite envied her. She had grown up coddled, a sweet and naive girl, but that too was a kind of happiness.\n\nIt was nothing like his own situation. A child who grew up in an orphanage always had a congenital sense of insecurity. Anyone who wanted to get ahead would spare no effort to do so.\n\nLike his childhood friend, Wang Ke, who was so driven day and night that he didn't even know his wife went out to get her hair done.¹\n\nPeople...\n\nIt seemed the less you thought about them, the more they appeared. Because a red sedan soon pulled up on the road in front of Zhou Ze's shop.\n\nA familiar person got out: Wang Ke's wife, along with the little loli.\n\n\"Hello, Miss. Hello, Uncle.\"\n\nThe little loli greeted them乖巧地.\n\nHis sister-in-law couldn't help but crouch down and pinch the little loli's cheek, saying, \"What an adorable little doll.\"\n\nThe woman smiled at Zhou Ze and said, \"I'm going to get my hair done. She'll read here for a bit.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nAfter thanking him, the woman turned, got back in her car, and drove away. Her movements were large and showed a sense of impatience.\n\nHis sister-in-law also hailed a cab and left, reminding Zhou Ze once more before she went to cover for her.\n\nAt the shop's entrance, the little loli stood beside Zhou Ze as he crouched there, smoking.\n\n\"You haven't come back, have you?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n\"Uncle, what are you talking about?\" The little loli looked somewhat confused, cute and innocent.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the little loli on the head.\n\n\"Come on, let's go read.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked out a copy of *Guwen Guanzhi*² for the little loli and handed it to her. Then he asked, \"How are your grades in school?\"\n\n\"My grades are very good,\" the little loli said proudly.\n\n\"Do you have any hobbies?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I can do ballet, and I'm also learning piano,\" the little loli answered.\n\n\"What would you like to drink?\"\n\n\"I want to drink Coke.\" After saying this, the little loli stuck out her tongue. \"Mommy usually doesn't let me drink it.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, went next door to Xu Qinglang's place, and came back with a can of Coke.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nThe little loli took the Coke and said sweetly:\n\n\"Thank you, Uncle.\"\n\nAfter taking a sip of Coke, the little loli turned another page of the book and began reading with relish.\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\nZhou Ze, holding a glass of water, spoke suddenly.\n\nThe cutesy expression on the little loli's face gradually faded, replaced by an adult-like solemnity.\n\nShe held up the book in her hands.\n\n\"When I realized I shouldn't be reading this book, I found it was already too late.\"\n\nThe book in the little loli's hand was the *Guwen Guanzhi* Zhou Ze had initially given her, and it wasn't a modern vernacular or youth edition.\n\n\"What are you here for?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHad the one in Rongcheng been dealt with?\n\nSo, she was back?\n\n\"I just got back from Hell. I missed you, so I came to see you.\" The little loli stood up, tilted her head slightly, and looked at Zhou Ze with a smile. \"I've discovered that you're quite the slacker. Very lazy and passive.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The performance chart shows that my results for this period are at the bottom of this entire region.\" The little loli licked her lips. \"I told you to handle things before, but I didn't tell you to be *this* lazy.\"\n\n\"Performance chart?\" When Zhou Ze heard this, his heart skipped a beat.\n\n\"What, is there a problem? You think being an Underworld Emissary doesn't require performance reviews?\" the little loli retorted.\n\n\"Can you... let me see it?\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask why I can't just give it to you?\"\n\nThe little loli moved closer to Zhou Ze. She wanted to meet his gaze, but she was too short. Being so close just made it so Zhou Ze was looking down on her.\n\nThis made her very uncomfortable.\n\nShe waved her hand dismissively.\n\nAnd said angrily:\n\n\"Pick me up.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked up the little loli, allowing her eyes to be level with his.\n\n\"Don't think I don't know what's on your mind.\" The little loli's chilly fingers stroked Zhou Ze's chin for a moment. \"Do you really want to become a permanent employee?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThere was no shame in admitting it.\n\n\"I can give you something to look forward to. I'll be going to Rongcheng in a little while. Once I take care of that troublemaker, I might get a chance for a promotion.\n\nWhen that time comes, my original position can be transferred to you, as long as you bring my performance stats back up next month.\"\n\nThe little loli was dangling a huge carrot in front of him.\n\nZhou Ze was starting to understand. The little loli's behavior was a bit like someone who worked at a company but outsourced their tasks to someone else while they went off to do freelance work.\n\n\"Perhaps I can look forward to another possibility,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What possibility?\"\n\n\"You die in Rongcheng, and the position naturally becomes mine.\"\n\nDeep down, Zhou Ze didn't want anything to happen to that person in Rongcheng. After all, she had helped him in a dream last time.\n\nAs for why he was being so blunt, it was simple. There really was no need for them to beat around the bush.\n\n\"Heh heh...\"\n\nThe little loli didn't get angry, nor did she seem upset. Instead, she actively jumped down from Zhou Ze's arms, clasped her hands behind her back, and said:\n\n\"You think that person still has a chance? You have no idea how many Emissaries have come this time.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't be explaining this to me.\" Zhou Ze lit another cigarette, blew a smoke ring, and said, \"Explaining just proves that you're afraid too.\"\n\n\"Don't flatter him, and don't flatter yourself.\" The little loli turned around, her deep eyes staring at Zhou Ze. \"Aren't you a doctor? Why would you hope for me to die?\n\nAm I not cute?\"\n\n\"Oh, what a cute child! Where did you come from?\"\n\nBai Yingying happened to be coming down from the second floor just then. Upon seeing the little loli, she immediately walked over happily, ready to give the child a hug.\n\n\"Madam Bai?\"\n\nThe little loli frowned slightly.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nNo matter how slow Bai Yingying was, she knew this was no neighbor's kid.\n\n\"Oh, my old neighbor has already cultivated enough merit and descended. You are the shell she left behind.\" The little loli glared at Zhou Ze. \"You're keeping her by your side. No wonder fewer ghosts are actively approaching you!\"\n\n\"You are?\" Bai Yingying asked timidly.\n\n\"My time is short. I just came to remind you. I'm not afraid of you having your own ideas. Who doesn't have their own ideas?\"\n\nThe little loli walked arrogantly to the bookshelf.\n\n\"In one month, I will be back. Whether you can take over my position, I don't know. Whether I'll secure a promotion, I also don't know.\n\nBut if you fail to raise my performance stats next month...\n\nThen there's no need for you to remain in the mortal realm. Go back to your Hell and wait to drink Meng Po's soup.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the little loli's head tilted to one side, and she fainted. Immediately after, a black light suddenly shot up.\n\n*Biu!*\n\nIt shot straight into the ground!\n\n\"Boss, who is she? A Judge?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"An Underworld Emissary. I'm a temp, she's a tenured employee,\" Zhou Ze said as he picked up the sleeping little loli, placed her on the boss's chair behind his counter, and covered her with a blanket.\n\n\"She's just an Emissary. I feel like even a Judge wouldn't be as arrogant as her.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen a Judge?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"After your Madam descended, what status will she have?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but she should receive an official title in Hell.\"\n\nJust then, a middle-aged man in a police uniform pushed open the bookstore door and walked in.\n\nThe moment he entered,\n\nit felt as if the temperature in the bookstore had risen slightly, and both Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying simultaneously felt a sense of discomfort.\n\nIt was like thorns pricking their backs.\n\nZhou Ze turned to look at him. The man wore a police cap, and the national emblem on it shone brightly under the reflection of the sunlight outside.\n\nHe had a square face, thick lips, and a large frame, exuding an air of authority.\n\n\"Boss, recommend a few good books for me to read. I'm going on a business trip soon and need something to pass the time on the road,\" the police uncle said, taking off his hat and scratching his scalp.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled faintly, observed the man carefully for a moment, and confirmed he wasn't a ghost.\n\nOnly then did he turn to the bookshelf, find a few books, and hand them to him.\n\nThe police uncle took the stack of books. When he saw the first one, he was stunned. It was actually *Foundations of Public Security*.\n\nHe flipped to the second book.\n\nThe police uncle was stunned again. It was the *People's Police Law of the People's Republic of China*.\n\nThere were two more underneath: *The Theory and Practice of Dispute Resolution* and *An Explanation of Chin Na and Combat Techniques*.\n\nThe police uncle took a deep breath, seemingly contemplating how to phrase his next words, then put the books down.\n\n\"I misspoke just now. I'm taking my son on a trip, and I'm afraid he'll be bored on the way. I want to buy him a few books to pass the time. He likes to read horror.\"\n\n\"Oh, got it.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out two books from a box below and handed them to the man.\n\nThey were: *Terrifying Webnovel* and *Terror Broadcast*.\n\nOnly then did the police uncle nod in satisfaction.\n\n\"These are good.\"\n\n---\n¹ A popular Chinese internet meme from 2017, where \"getting her hair done\" became a euphemism for a wife cheating on her husband.\n\n² *Guwen Guanzhi*, or *Models of the Ancient Prose*, is a famous anthology of classical Chinese prose compiled during the Qing dynasty. Reading the original classical text requires a high level of literary education, far beyond that of a young child.",

    "content": "The police officer sat there, flipping through a book and checking his phone for the time now and then.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nhis presence in the shop was a source of immense pressure for both Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying.\n\nIt was like having needles in their backs.\n\nThis was a good cop. With his righteous aura, compounded by the uniform he wore, he could make almost any evil spirit flee.\n\nBut Zhou Ze couldn't flee; this was, after all, his own shop.\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying weren't low-level wandering ghouls or wild mountain sprites. While it was uncomfortable, there was no substantial harm.\n\nOn the contrary, Zhou Ze felt a genuine, heartfelt respect for the man.\n\nIt's true that you can't know a person's heart just by looking at them,¹\n\nbut as a ghost, one was much more sensitive to this sort of feeling.\n\nThat's why the initial batch of books Zhou Ze had brought him wasn't an attempt to tease him. Rather, Zhou Ze had assumed that a police officer who could cultivate such a formidable righteous aura would naturally enjoy reading serious and valuable books.\n\nOnly later did Zhou Ze realize that police officers were people too.\n\nAnd as people, they had their own interests and hobbies. The police officer before him, for example, was sitting there, completely absorbed in a novel.\n\n\"Uncle, have some tea.\"\n\nBai Yingying timidly brought a cup of tea over.\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\" The police officer took the cup, looked at Bai Yingying, and asked, \"Shouldn't you be in school?\"\n\n\"It's a holiday today.\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't dare say she wasn't in school and was just loafing around, lest it lead to more trouble.\n\nShe was a little afraid of the man before her—even more so than Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was a modern man and could fit into this mindset. While the officer before him stirred a primal fear, from another perspective, it also meant he was all the more worthy of respect.\n\nBai Yingying, however, just felt her heart pounding a little too fast. After delivering the tea, she immediately ran upstairs, not wanting to come down again.\n\n\"Boss, how much is it?\" the police officer asked, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Pay whatever you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"That won't do. Never mind, I'll settle up when I leave. They should be here to pick me up in about half an hour.\" The police officer sat back down, patted his pocket, and paused.\n\nAs an old smoker, Zhou Ze understood. He offered him a cigarette.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nThe police officer thanked Zhou Ze for lighting it, and the two of them smoked together.\n\nCigarettes truly were a bridge for male socializing. They went from strangers to smoking buddies, making it easier to shoot the breeze.\n\n\"Business can't be too good here, can it?\" the police officer asked.\n\n\"Just getting by,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Hey, I remember who you are,\" the officer said, tapping his head. \"During that fire, you were the one who acted heroically and rushed in to save people, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Look at my memory. Right, the Bureau was going to give you a commendation banner. Why didn't you go accept it?\"\n\n\"It was just my duty. I didn't want to be in the limelight,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\nThe police officer nodded, looking somewhat helpless. \"True. In the end, no one expected that the arsonist would turn out to be one of the heroes who rushed into the fire to save people.\"\n\n\"Dammit, have all the taxis just disappeared? It's impossible to get a ride-share at this hour, and I can't hail a cab either. Old Zhou, looks like we really have to move. You can't even get a damn taxi in this godforsaken place.\"\n\n\"I'm missing a cable, so I have to go all the way back to buy a new one, otherwise I can't assemble the computer.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked in, complaining, then saw the police officer sitting in the bookstore.\n\n\"Well, hello, Director Zhao!\"\n\nXu Qinglang clearly knew the officer. A smile immediately spread across his face as he said warmly:\n\n\"Director Zhao, you're looking as hale and hearty as ever. Hiss, I remember seeing some news about you not long ago. What was it about? I forget, but I think it was about you earning another commendation and a medal. Yes, that must be it. Congratulations, congratulations!\"\n\n\"You little rascal, you've gotten better and better looking,\" the police officer said, chuckling as he stood up. He patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder with clear affection. \"Still up to your old petty thievery?\"\n\n\"How would I dare? My family's old house was demolished, and we got over twenty apartments in compensation. I'm a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen now,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"You...\" Director Zhao pointed at Xu Qinglang. \"I suppose your hard times are finally over.\"\n\n\"Director Zhao, your son must be getting married soon, right? Why don't I give you one of my apartments as a wedding gift for him?\"\n\n\"You little brat. If you dare say such nonsense in front of me again, believe me, I'll throw you back in the station,\" Director Zhao scolded sternly.\n\n\"Hey, I just run a little noodle shop; it's not like I'm bribing you. If it wasn't for you back then, I probably wouldn't have lasted until my family's old house and land were redeveloped. Giving you an apartment is just a sign of respect. It's what I should do.\"\n\n\"Just live your life well. That's enough.\"\n\n\"You two know each other?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nDirector Zhao nodded. \"Know him? More than just know him. This kid started stealing on the streets before he was ten, picking pockets. I caught him many times.\"\n\n\"The first time I caught him, I even told my men I'd caught a little girl thief. Who knew he was a boy!\"\n\n\"I was young and dumb. Let's not bring up the past, okay?\" Xu Qinglang didn't want Zhou Ze hearing about his shameful history.\n\n\"We have to bring it up. You did a lot of crooked things back then, kid. You can't forget those mistakes. You have to keep them in your heart as a reminder not to repeat them. These good days didn't come easy.\"\n\n\"I understand, Director Zhao,\" Xu Qinglang nodded.\n\n\"By the way, I sent you to be Master Sun's apprentice back then. How is Master Sun's health these days?\" Director Zhao asked.\n\n\"He's doing alright, but he passed his shop down to his son, so I struck out on my own.\"\n\nSo that was part of the reason Xu Qinglang had opened a noodle shop. Back when his family had fallen on hard times, he was on the verge of becoming a street punk. Director Zhao, who was the police station chief at the time, caught him and lectured him several times. In the end, Director Zhao even arranged for him to be an apprentice at a noodle shop, which finally set him on the right path.\n\nOtherwise, the current Xu Qinglang might have one more property to his name: a jail cell.\n\n\"Director Zhao, what brings you here?\" After saying that, Xu Qinglang added in a low voice, \"I'm telling you, you should come here less often. The *feng shui* is bad.\"\n\nThe implication was that more dead people than living people came to read books at Zhou Ze's shop.\n\nZhou Ze raised an eyebrow.\n\n*What's that supposed to mean?*\n\n\"You brat, you still haven't kicked that habit of spouting superstitious nonsense. I was born and raised under the red flag; I don't believe in any of that crooked stuff.\"\n\n\"Besides, if you walk a straight path and live an upright life, you have no reason to fear ghosts knocking at your door.\"\n\n\"Even if there really are ghosts in this world, they should be afraid of me. I'm certainly not afraid of them!\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his nose. *You're actually right about that.*\n\n\"Director Zhao, let me cook a few dishes myself. It's been years since we've seen each other. How about a couple of drinks tonight?\"\n\n\"Can't. Someone's coming to pick me up soon. I'm heading out of province for a business trip. I was just afraid of getting bored on the road, so I came to buy a couple of novels to read.\"\n\n\"You're already a Director and you're still so busy,\" Xu Qinglang said, a little disappointed.\n\n\"Being busy is good. I'm a police officer. If the police slack off, the common people can't rest easy.\"\n\nDirector Zhao scratched his head, put his police cap back on, and checked his phone for the time again.\n\n\"It's about time. They should be here to get me. I'm leaving now.\"\n\n\"Take care.\"\n\n*Finally sending this radiant deity on his way,* Zhou Ze thought.\n\nDirector Zhao reached the doorway, then seemed to remember something. He reached into his pocket, looking like he was about to take out his wallet.\n\n\"Look at my memory. I took the books and drank the tea, but I almost forgot to pay.\"\n\n\"Don't be a stranger, I already paid,\" Xu Qinglang immediately stepped forward and said. \"The owner here grew up eating my food. He's one of us.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"That won't do. Why should you pay for books that I bought?\" Director Zhao protested.\n\n\"Alright, how about this: I'll come visit you in a few days to let you pay me back for the books, and I'll get a free meal out of it. How's that?\" Xu Qinglang pleaded. \"You have to give me a reason to drop by, right?\"\n\n\"Fine. Your aunt is a pretty good cook. I might not be home, so I'll have your aunt cook you a meal. You should learn a thing or two from her, tell her I said so. Try to turn that noodle shop into a hotel someday.\"\n\n\"A person needs to have some ambition. Don't just lie on top of those apartments waiting to die of boredom. There's no point in that.\"\n\n\"Heh, what's the point of me going if you're not home,\" Xu Qinglang laughed.\n\n\"Alright, I'm off. See you!\" Director Zhao waved to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, then pushed open the bookstore door and left.\n\n\"Boss, there are so many cars outside,\" said Bai Yingying, who had been upstairs and was now calling down from the staircase.\n\n\"What cars?\" Xu Qinglang asked. \"A wedding procession?\"\n\n\"A wedding procession isn't as impressive as an eight-man sedan chair,\" Zhou Ze teased Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"It's not a wedding procession. It's taxis. Lots of taxis. The whole road is filled with taxis,\" Bai Yingying said. She had a clear view from the second-floor window.\n\n\"Taxis?\" Xu Qinglang froze for a second. \"Damn. No wonder it was so hard to get a ride today. Couldn't see a single taxi. Are they organizing a strike or a protest?\"\n\nSuddenly, Xu Qinglang paused.\n\nAs if he'd thought of something, he immediately pulled out his phone and started searching. Finally, he found it.\n\nIt was a news story from half a month ago.\n\nThe front page of the story featured a large photo of Director Zhao. The article described how a car theft ring that had been operating across several provinces was apprehended in Tongcheng. They had been discovered by a deputy police director on his way home from work. During the ensuing struggle, the deputy director had tragically died in the line of duty.\n\nThree days later, the police rounded up the entire criminal gang, not letting a single one escape. The ring specialized in stealing taxis and was responsible for the deaths of two taxi drivers.\n\nDirector Zhao had sacrificed his life long ago.\n\n\"He's already dead... I remember reading this news. I was so sad for a long time. But just now, seeing him right in front of me, I subconsciously thought he was still alive. I completely forgot about that news story.\"\n\nFinished speaking, Xu Qinglang looked furiously at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"He was a ghost! He wasn't a living person! Why didn't you remind me just now? There was still so much I wanted to say to him!\"\n\nZhou Ze was also stunned. \"He was a ghost?\"\n\n\"You didn't realize? You're a Ghost Emissary and you didn't realize?\"\n\n\"I observed him carefully when he came in. He was a person.\"\n\n\"How could he be a person!\" Xu Qinglang practically roared.\n\nHe could have said a proper goodbye to him, but he had just been caught up in small talk!\n\n\"Why would I lie to you? I looked closely. I really didn't notice he was a ghost.\"\n\n\"I didn't notice either,\" Bai Yingying added, walking over.\n\nJust then, on the road outside the shop,\n\nrows of taxis advanced slowly in two columns. The line was long, so very long, stretching almost to the horizon.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed the door open and walked out. Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying followed.\n\nNearly a thousand taxis had spontaneously organized into a procession. The taxi drivers, both male and female, had abandoned their usual habits of speeding and constantly overtaking.\n\nThis time,\n\nthey drove very, very slowly.\n\nAt the rear of the procession,\n\nthere was a hearse. A funeral dirge played from it.\n\nAt the same time, a large black-and-white photograph was mounted on top of the hearse. It was a funeral portrait of Director Zhao.\n\n\"Is today the funeral?\" Xu Qinglang said, crestfallen. \"So when he said he was going on a business trip and someone was coming to pick him up, he meant the funeral procession?\"\n\n\"But how could I not have seen he was a ghost? And you couldn't see it either.\"\n\n\"Some people are alive, but they are already dead;\"\n\n\"Some people are dead, but they are still alive.\"\n\n\"Perhaps... that's the reason why,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Sigh.\" Hearing this, Xu Qinglang nodded. He turned to the long procession of cars and waved. He was saying goodbye.\n\nAt the same time, a sense of understanding settled in his heart. No wonder it was so hard to get a taxi in Tongcheng today.\n\nZhou Ze watched the car with the funeral portrait drive slowly past.\n\nIn his heart, he said a silent farewell:\n\n\"Journey well.\"\n\n---\n\nThis story is based on a true event.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **人心隔肚皮 (rén xīn gé dù pí):** A literal translation of the idiom, meaning \"a person's heart is separated by their belly skin,\" conveying that one cannot easily know another's true thoughts or intentions.",

    "title": "Chapter Sixty-Two: Split Personality",
    "content": "Xu Qinglang had originally planned to perform a ritual for Director Zhao, hoping to help him pass on more peacefully and to express his own feelings.\n\nBut on second thought, Director Zhao had actually been very peaceful when he passed. He was even afraid of being bored on the Yellow Springs Road, so he'd specifically brought two books to read along the way.\n\nFurthermore, the motorcade of nearly a thousand taxis and numerous citizens, all self-organized to see him off, was more than enough to protect Director Zhao on his journey. There was no need for him to gild the lily.\n\n\"Old Zhou, he was a really good person.\"\n\nXu Qinglang smoked his cigarette, the corners of his eyes a little red. It was a pitiable sight.\n\n\"He went with great ease.\"\n\nEven though he had been a doctor in his past life and had saved and helped many people, Zhou Ze didn't consider himself particularly great. His profession was a doctor; saving lives and healing the wounded was simply his duty.\n\nIn fact, those ordinary yet great people are often just doing their own jobs in society, but the brilliance they radiate isn't confined to the corner of their work.\n\nThere are always some things that can move you, that can move many people.\n\nPeople often wonder if the eyes of the masses are truly discerning.\n\nBut those nearly one thousand taxi drivers who formed a procession to clear the way for him—their hearts were crystal clear.\n\n\"I'm going to get some rest.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out a tissue, wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes, and turned to go back to his noodle shop. He needed a drink, and then a good, long sleep. Strong people never like to show their vulnerable side to others.\n\nAfter finishing his cigarette, Zhou Ze also walked back to the bookstore. The little loli had told him to go improve sales, but Zhou Ze was as lazy as ever.\n\nHe really just lacked any subjective initiative. Besides, Zhou Ze was waiting for a result: what would be the final outcome for that person in Rongcheng?\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze himself felt that the other party's chances of turning the tables were slim—the little loli had personally returned to Hell and even released the Faceless Woman to help, and had also joined forces with many other hell messengers.\n\nBut,\n\nWhat if?\n\nWhat if?\n\nYeah, what if!\n\nZhou Ze even genuinely considered and looked forward to the possibility that if the one in Rongcheng managed to get the little loli killed, then wouldn't her position naturally fall to him?\n\nA man's got to have a dream.\n\nTaking out his phone, Zhou Ze dialed a number. It was the old Taoist's phone.\n\nThe two hadn't been in contact since Zhou Ze treated the old Taoist to a meal last time.\n\nNo one answered. Zhou Ze put his phone down, but soon, the other party called back:\n\n\"Hey, big brother, I’m not in Tongcheng right now, I’m in Xucheng. What’s up? Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally wanted to have the old Taoist remind that person to be careful, but on second thought, he didn't waste his breath. He didn't even make any small talk and just hung up the phone.\n\nThe old Taoist on the other end of the line was probably baffled.\n\nIn that dream, the young man had clearly known he was being targeted, so his reminder now would be redundant.\n\nThe guy knew what was up.\n\nStretching lazily, Zhou Ze saw that the little loli was now awake, having reverted to her dazed and adorable state. Then her mother, finished with her hair appointment, came back to pick her up.\n\nIt was clear her mother's hair appointment had been a great success. While her hair was still unchanged, her whole person was more radiant, her face flushed and glowing, like a flower bud in the early summer morning sprinkled with dew, making her appear all the more mature and delicate.\n\nWhen she got out of the car and walked, her legs were spread wider apart.\n\nThe day's events should have ended there. Zhou Ze had planned to take a shower and then prepare for the evening's business.\n\nThe little loli had said that keeping Bai Yingying, this jiangshi, by his side was like putting a lampshade over him, a white-hot incandescent bulb, which would reduce his probability of encountering ghosts. But Zhou Ze currently had no intention of sending Bai Yingying away.\n\nSleeping with a freezer was, of course, not as comfortable as sleeping with Bai Yingying.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze was getting a bit tired of ghosts constantly showing up at the bookstore. And this was with Bai Yingying around. If she weren't here, he'd probably have to deal with a whole slew of spirits every single night.\n\nZhou Ze felt he had degenerated. His self from his past life had been so ambitious, so motivated, whereas his current self just wanted to drift through the days. But this lazy, aimless feeling, a life of doing nothing but reading and the Ge You slouch¹...\n\n...felt so damn good.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze asked Bai Yingying to get him a change of clothes so he could go shower, someone pushed open the shop door.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, slightly surprised by this person's arrival, because his daughter and wife had just left the store moments ago.\n\n\"I'm here for a follow-up, to see how you've been doing recently.\"\n\nWang Ke very naturally pulled out a plastic stool and sat down, gesturing for Zhou Ze to sit across from him.\n\nHe had his own psychiatric hospital, and his fees were very high, so making a house call to check on Zhou Ze for free was, in his and others' eyes, indeed giving Zhou Ze a great deal of face.\n\nOf course, half of this face was for the real Zhou Ze, and the other half was because Zhou Ze had saved his daughter.\n\nZhou Ze sat down opposite Wang Ke.\n\nHe tried his best to lower his gaze and not look at Wang Ke's head.\n\nBecause atop Wang Ke's head, the green light was thick and vibrant, as if ten thousand horses were stampeding there.\n\nThe bookstore's computer was connected to a small Bluetooth speaker, which was randomly playing pop music. Just then, it switched to Stefanie Sun's \"Green Light.\"\n\nEven the shuffle function was so mischievous these days.\n\n\"So, tell me, how have you been feeling lately?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"I think I'm fine. The problem isn't a big deal anymore,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"I can tell. You're very calm, and you seem to be handling things with ease,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\nThen, the two of them fell silent.\n\nZhou Ze found it a bit strange. It seemed that the man hadn't come specifically for a follow-up on his condition; that was just a pretext.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to ask you to help me with,\" Wang Ke said, speaking again.\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nSetting aside their relationship from his past life, just based on the advice and analysis he had offered when treating him recently, Zhou Ze owed him a favor.\n\n\"I have a client who has dissociative identity disorder. Her problem is quite complex and a bit difficult to handle, so I need your help to go see her and analyze the situation.\"\n\n\"That shouldn't be difficult for you, should it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It is,\" Wang Ke said with a wry smile. \"Her father is an important business partner of mine. My psychiatric hospital was only established with his investment.\n\n\"If it were simply a matter of helping the primary personality eliminate the secondary one, or vice versa, I have ways and means to attempt it.\n\n\"But the problem is complicated by the fact that, for my partner, while his daughter's primary personality is, of course, his daughter herself, the secondary personality is very similar to his wife.\"\n\n\"So... mother and daughter are living in the same body?\"\n\n\"Yes. His wife passed away from an illness last year. He was heartbroken. His daughter is only sixteen this year. I analyze that it might be because the girl subconsciously couldn't accept the fact that her mother was dead.\n\n\"So she slowly 'recreated' an image of her mother in her own consciousness to keep her company.\n\n\"If this problem had been discovered earlier, it would have been fine. But by the time it was truly discovered and taken seriously, it was too late. The second personality had already formed and was very mature.\n\n\"During the day, she is the daughter. At night, she is the mother.\n\n\"During the day, she goes to school, plays computer games, and watches TV shows in her room.\n\n\"At night, she wants to go to her father's bedroom to sleep. If my friend doesn't open the door, she'll cry outside, saying he has another woman and doesn't want to touch her anymore.\"\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze said with a laugh.\n\nWang Ke's expression was a bit awkward. Zhou Ze's comment made him uncomfortable; joking about a patient was a very disrespectful thing to do.\n\n\"My apologies,\" Zhou Ze raised a hand to signal his misspeaking, but still continued, \"So, how does your partner want to solve this problem?\"\n\nLet his \"wife\" die a second time, or let his daughter become his wife? A happy choice of one out of two.\n\nZhou Ze had also been a doctor in his past life. Logically, he shouldn't be thinking about this matter with such a teasing attitude, but in reality, Zhou Ze couldn't bring himself to be completely serious, especially since he had already discerned the father's thoughts from Wang Ke's description.\n\nThere were only three ways to solve the problem: keep the daughter, keep the \"wife,\" or keep them both.\n\nOf course, there was another extreme method: keep neither, but that was tantamount to murder, so it was out of the question.\n\nAs a doctor, you should only be responsible for your patient.\n\nIn his previous life, when Zhou Ze was saving people in the hospital, he often encountered obstruction from the outside. For instance, a pregnant woman had acute inflammation, but her family actually blocked the doctor from taking an X-ray, saying they were afraid it would affect the baby's health. But at that moment, the situation was that the inflammation could very well kill both mother and child.\n\nIn this case, that so-called \"wife\" was nothing but a virtual personality, a sickness the daughter developed from missing her deceased mother.\n\nTherefore, helping the daughter move on and escape the influence of that so-called second personality was the correct course of treatment.\n\nBut Wang Ke was conflicted, which meant the father had chosen the third option: he also loved his wife, also missed his wife, so he hoped that in his daughter, he could both see his daughter and feel that his wife was still alive.\n\n\"He loves his wife very much,\" Wang Ke said.\n\n\"But love, much of the time, is just a disguise for selfishness.\"\n\n\"Does this mean you're unwilling to help?\"\n\n\"I don't know how I can help you.\"\n\n\"You're the most perfect case I've ever seen of a second personality successfully taking over. I think you might be able to communicate with that mother personality. To ensure they can continue to coexist harmoniously in one body. The problem now is that the two personalities are already showing signs of instability.\n\n\"They will slowly begin to cross over and become chaotic.\n\n\"And then, she'll turn into another, unfamiliar person.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't do it,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Wang Ke. \"Mr. Wang, I remember when my good friend Zhou Ze was alive, he told me you were a very upright and principled man.\"\n\nWang Ke frowned slightly, but then quickly relaxed, saying:\n\n\"People change. Without my investor's help, I wouldn't have gotten to where I am today.\"\n\nWang Ke stood up, apparently intending to leave. Since he couldn't persuade Zhou Ze, he had no reason to stay any longer.\n\n\"I think I bought a lottery ticket and forgot to check the winning numbers. Maybe I won five million. I should go check now,\" Zhou Ze said suddenly.\n\n\"The probability of that is too low,\" Wang Ke smiled.\n\n\"Scratching a lottery ticket is like looking at a paternity test. In your heart, you know the thing is probably useless, but you can't help but take a look anyway.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze smiled at Wang Ke and continued:\n\n\"Right?\"\n\n***\n\n¹ A Chinese internet meme referencing a famously lazy, slumped posture of actor Ge You from a 1990s sitcom.",

    "content": "Three more days passed after he had last refused Wang Ke. Zhou Ze had already forgotten about the matter. For the past few days, Bai Yingying, with nothing to do, had been going to Xu Qinglang's shop to play computer games, while Xu Qinglang would go to the bookstore to chat with Zhou Ze and read the newspapers.\n\nAlthough Director Zhao had told Xu Qinglang before he left that it was best not to waste one's life away lounging on property, and Xu Qinglang had agreed.\n\nYes,\n\nbeing lazy certainly won't make you successful,\n\nbut,\n\nbeing lazy sure feels good.\n\nXu Qinglang had fallen from grace. For the past three days, he hadn't lit the stove in his shop for any reason other than to cook for Zhou Ze and himself. He hadn't even opened his food delivery apps; his shop's status was consistently \"Closed for Business.\"\n\nAt noon, Zhou Ze had just finished his lunch, washed down with strawberry juice, and was taking a stroll in front of the bookstore when he saw that familiar red sedan approaching.\n\nThis left Zhou Ze a bit speechless. It had only been three days, did this woman need her hair done *again*?\n\nGetting your hair done too often can damage it.\n\nSoon, the woman parked the car, but then, Wang Ke got out as well.\n\nWang Ke jogged up to Zhou Ze, looked at him, and said:\n\n\"Help me.\"\n\nVery simple,\n\nand very direct.\n\nJust those two words.\n\nThere was no preceding buildup, which meant these two words were a direct continuation of their last topic: the patient with the mother-daughter personality.\n\n\"Things have gotten worse. Her personalities are starting to become chaotic,\" Wang Ke said urgently. \"You have to help me.\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged.\n\nThe meaning was simple:\n\n*Sorry,*\n\n*I still don't want to get involved in this.*\n\nWhat should have been a simple one-plus-one-equals-two problem had been delayed into a much more serious issue. This was a man-made disaster, not a natural one.\n\nIn all this, Wang Ke, by prioritizing his investor's interests, had lost the integrity and duty of a doctor.\n\n\"I don't have time.\" Zhou Ze pointed at his bookstore. \"I have to watch the shop.\"\n\nHe just wanted to refuse. All he needed was an excuse, any reason would do, even if it was a lame one. It didn't matter.\n\n\"What's your daily revenue? I'll give you ten times that.\"\n\nWang Ke said directly,\n\n\"Just come with me once. I think you can help. She almost succeeded in killing herself last night. If she hadn't been discovered early, she'd be a corpse right now!\"\n\nZhou Ze was in agony.\n\nHis neighbor was richer than him.\n\nHis wife was richer than him.\n\nHis maid was richer than him.\n\nAnd now his childhood friend¹ was saying things like \"What's your daily revenue? I'll give you ten times that.\"\n\nIt was soul-crushing.\n\nSo soul-crushing that Zhou Ze wanted to ask the \"little loli\" next time he saw her to check for him in the underworld if he was fated to be a pauper, to be so poor in both of his lives.\n\n\"This is about sentiment. It can't be measured in money.\" Zhou Ze truly didn't want to go. He was a surgeon. To be honest, he only knew a little bit about psychology, just scratching the surface.\n\n\"Come with me, give me a hand!\"\n\nWang Ke grabbed Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a bit uncomfortable.\n\nEven Xu Qinglang, a man prettier than any woman, had never done something like this to him. He immediately took a step back, trying to pull his hand away, but Wang Ke held it tight.\n\nZhou Ze's brow furrowed slightly.\n\nWas he really going to force him like this?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to get angry,\n\nWang Ke suddenly lowered his voice and said:\n\n\"A Ze, help me!\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes shot wide open, his gaze fixed on Wang Ke.\n\nWhat had he just called him?\n\nWang Ke took several deep breaths. \"If this isn't resolved, my career is over. I won't lie to you, I was the one who advised my investor to opt for preserving both personalities. I told him I had the ability to handle the treatment and arrangements properly.\n\nNow, I'm panicking. I'm at my wit's end. I can only rely on you.\"\n\n\"What did you just call me?\" Zhou Ze also lowered his voice.\n\nXu Qinglang happened to step out of the shop for a smoke and saw the two men outside, holding hands, whispering intimately, their heads close together.\n\nHe immediately sucked in a sharp breath, feeling a sharp pain in his teeth, and sighed,\n\n\"A scandalous sight, truly scandalous.\"\n\nWang Ke's wife and Bai Yingying stood to the side, also finding it hard to understand why their respective men were being so intimate and sharing secrets.\n\n\"A Ze, help me.\"\n\nWang Ke repeated.\n\nHe could see it.\n\nHe had seen it for a long time.\n\nBut he had been playing dumb.\n\nOr rather, he wasn't sure, and the discovery and deduction were too shocking. But at this moment, he could only hope for Zhou Ze's help.\n\nZhou Ze bit his lip, looked up, and then nodded.\n\nHe had agreed.\n\nHe had no way of refusing.\n\nJust as when he had gone to Wang Ke's house and given the name Zhou Ze, and Wang Ke had immediately dropped his most important work to treat him,\n\nnow,\n\nWang Ke had said his name. Before him, he was no longer Xu Le, but Zhou Ze, and there was no longer any room to refuse.\n\nAs childhood friends who grew up together in an orphanage, even though they had barely kept in touch after finishing school and starting their careers, each fighting and striving in their own fields, the memories of growing up together, encouraging and supporting each other, were still real.\n\n\"Let's go, get in the car.\"\n\nWang Ke eagerly opened the car door for Zhou Ze, and Zhou Ze got in.\n\nWang Ke and Zhou Ze sat together in the back seat, while the woman drove.\n\nInside the car, for a long time, no one spoke.\n\nThis made the woman driving feel a bit oppressed, but she didn't ask any questions.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car window to let some of the outside air blow in, then said:\n\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"We grew up together. Habits, movements, details.\" As he spoke, Wang Ke tapped his own head with his finger. \"Besides, this is my profession.\"\n\nA smile appeared on the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth, and he said no more.\n\nWang Ke continued, \"Help me fix this, and I won't reminisce with you, I won't contact you again, and I won't bother you again. I don't have any other curiosity.\n\nYou can trust your big brother on this.\"\n\n\"Are you still... the you from before?\" Zhou Ze asked in return.\n\n\"Last time, a guy named Xu Le knocked on my door in the middle of the night saying Zhou Ze sent him. How did I handle it?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nAfter a moment, Zhou Ze added, \"I'm a surgeon.\"\n\nThe meaning was: there's no use in you calling me here, I'm not a psychologist.\n\nUnless the girl tried to kill herself again, he'd have no problem helping with the emergency rescue, but as for anything else, he was truly willing but powerless.\n\n\"I've suspected for a long time that she's more than just a case of split personality,\" Wang Ke glanced at his wife who was driving and lowered his voice.\n\n\"Oh?\" Zhou Ze was taken aback for a moment,\n\nthen he understood the implication.\n\nWhat was very similar to \"split personality\"?\n\nGhost possession!\n\nNo wonder Wang Ke had come looking for him last time, saying his second personality could connect with her second personality.\n\nDamn it,\n\nthe subtext was:\n\n*You ghosts can communicate with each other!*\n\nFuck!\n\n...\n\nThis was Tongcheng's most high-end residential area, located at the foot of Wolf Mountain, with one high-class villa after another. When the car drove in, the several security guards at the gate saluted the people in the car.\n\nThis couldn't help but remind Zhou Ze of the small residential complex he lived in in his previous life, where the old guard in the gatehouse was usually off duty and asleep at night.\n\nOf course, Wang Ke had no idea that Zhou Ze's heart was currently suffering the torment of the wealth gap; he thought Zhou Ze was a bit depressed because his identity had been seen through.\n\nThe car pulled up to the villa's entrance, and a young man walked over. He was the butler here.\n\n\"Dr. Wang, Mr. Zheng is already furious,\" the butler advised.\n\n\"Did something happen to Miss Zheng again?\" Wang Ke's expression turned serious.\n\n\"No... it's that kind of...\" The young butler struggled to explain, finally just saying: \"There's no danger to her life. It wasn't suicide this time.\"\n\nWang Ke and Zhou Ze got out of the car and went straight up the stairs to the second floor. Wang Ke's wife didn't follow.\n\nThere were many rooms on the second floor, with red carpets laid throughout. The villa was huge, but the decoration style didn't seem vulgar or extravagant, showing that the owner was not some nouveau riche. On the contrary, he was likely a man of great taste.\n\nAfter turning a corner, Zhou Ze saw a middle-aged man with half-gray hair standing at the door of a bedroom. The man held a cigar in his hand, a worried look on his face.\n\nWhen he saw Wang Ke and Zhou Ze approaching, a flash of anger appeared in his eyes, but it was fleeting. He immediately put on a warm yet helpless smile and said:\n\n\"Dr. Wang, Pingping is again...\"\n\n\"What's wrong, Mr. Zheng?\" Wang Ke was also anxious.\n\nHe was the physician responsible for Zheng Pingping's treatment. Now that things had become like this, he couldn't shirk the blame. He knew in his heart that this wealthy businessman in front of him was surely very dissatisfied, but the man understood that losing his temper at this point was meaningless, so he had been restraining himself.\n\n\"See for yourself.\"\n\nMr. Zheng gestured for the two young men at the door to open the bedroom. Wang Ke and Zhou Ze walked in.\n\nInside, two maids were attending to her. In the center, a young girl in a dress, her arms wrapped in cloth strips, was dancing gracefully. She was singing an aria from a \"children's opera\"², her voice affecting a particular tone.\n\nWang Ke was completely stunned.\n\n\"How did it come to this?\"\n\nZhou Ze noticed the gauze wrapped around the girl's wrists. She must have just attempted to slash them in a suicide attempt but hadn't succeeded.\n\nThe girl, while dancing, seemed to notice the two men who had entered. She immediately raised her pitch, flicked the cloth strip, and pointed at Wang Ke, singing:\n\n\"A life fated to be alone, bringing doom to mother and father;\nA lifetime of bitter toil, only to weave a wedding dress for another,\nDoomed to end with wife and children scattered, betrayed by all in bitter, lonely sorrow!\"\n\nThe girl sang, then covered her face with her sleeve as if weeping in grief.\n\nWang Ke was bewildered, having no idea what performance this was.\n\nBut Zhou Ze understood.\n\nThe girl then waved her sleeve toward Zhou Ze and sang at the same time:\n\n\"Orphaned and helpless from a young age, adrift in fear and solitude;\nJust as you climbed the ladder to the clouds, you fell to an early death into the netherworld, a truly tragic sigh...\"\n\nSinging and singing,\n\n\"sighing\" and sighing,\n\nthe girl suddenly came to an abrupt halt,\n\nas if an old record player had suddenly gotten stuck.\n\nThen, a look of confusion on her face, the girl waved her long sleeves again and sang once more:\n\n\"Born with a handsome face, but inside a brutish mind!\nA man's knees hold gold, yet it has not the slightest to do with you!\nIn the end, a life of mediocrity, a wasted trip to the human world...\"\n\nThis time,\n\nthe girl got stuck again.\n\nThen she let out a scream,\n\ncollapsing onto the floor in fright, a large wet patch spreading beneath her trousers.\n\nPointing a finger at Zhou Ze, her face filled with terror, she cried out:\n\n\"Ghost... ghost...\n\nGhost!\"\n\n---\n¹ **childhood friend**: The original term, 髮小 (*fàxiǎo*), refers specifically to a friend one grew up with from a very young age, a bond often considered as strong as family.\n\n² **\"children's opera\"**: The original term is 童子戲 (*tóngzǐxì*), which can refer to operas performed by children or a specific style of opera. Here it implies a stylized, perhaps archaic, performance.",

    "content": "The girl pointed at Zhou Ze and screamed at the top of her lungs. Fortunately for him, she was already delirious and her personalities were jumbled, so this so-called \"accusation\" had no effect on him whatsoever.\n\nNo one would believe the words of a mentally unstable person.\n\nBesides, even if a normal person had said it, they would have been considered mentally unstable.\n\nBut the words the girl had sung earlier in the style of a \"Children's Opera,\" while they might have seemed nonsensical and bizarre to others, held a different, unusual meaning for Zhou Ze.\n\nWhat she sang,\n\nwere verdicts!\n\nSo-called verdicts were poems that summarized a person's entire life, judging their past and foretelling their future.\n\nFor example, in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the line \"One yields, two command, three are but wood; weeping toward Jinling, her sorrows compound\" is the verdict for Wang Xifeng.\n\n*A life of solitude, fated to cause the death of his parents;*\n\n*A lifetime of toil, all for another's gain,*\n\n*Destined to end with wife and child scattered, abandoned by all, in utter desolation and misery!*\n\nThis was about Wang Ke. Wang Ke, like him, had grown up in an orphanage. The line meant that Wang Ke had caused the death of his parents. As an adult, he was too busy with his career to care for anything else. The last line was easy enough to understand: his wife would leave him and his child would be lost to him.\n\nZhou Ze suspected that Wang Ke might have realized his wife was seeing someone else, but he hadn't exposed it. Furthermore, his daughter had been chosen by a Netherworld Emissary to be its physical vessel.\n\nAnd then there was the verdict the girl had sung for him:\n\n*Orphaned and alone since youth, adrift and in constant dread;*\n\n*Just as he climbed the ladder to the azure clouds, he met an untimely end and fell to the underworld, a truly lamentable fate…*\n\nThis referred to himself. An orphan by birth, he had relied on his own abilities to become a department head before the age of thirty. Just as he was on a straight path to success, he had died suddenly in a car crash.\n\nAs for \"a handsome appearance, but uncultivated within,\" this was about Xu Le being fair on the outside and foul on the inside. He was reasonably good-looking; otherwise, the Lin family wouldn't have chosen him as a live-in son-in-law.\n\nHere, \"uncultivated\" didn't refer to a murderous bandit, but to the fact that, aside from his looks, Xu Le was a good-for-nothing.\n\nThe original line, \"Though born with a handsome face, his mind was but a wasteland,\" was a critique of Jia Baoyu in *Dream of the Red Chamber*.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze felt the verdict's description of Xu Le was quite fitting. The Lin family was rich, truly rich. As a live-in son-in-law, it shouldn't have been difficult for Xu Le to start a business or some other venture. But the guy, like some insufferable artsy type, had opened a bookstore that did nothing but lose money.\n\nOf course, the girl's final sputtering and terror were because she had actually seen two lives within him.\n\nOne was the physical body,\n\nthe other was the soul.\n\nIn that instant,\n\nshe understood that she had seen a ghost.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze smile faintly. In that case, the girl before him was probably not possessed by a ghost.\n\nHe wasn't so formidable as to scare a ghost into wetting itself, the way he had with his sister-in-law.\n\nTwo nannies immediately came over to restrain the girl, constantly trying to soothe her.\n\nWang Ke also went over, attempting to calm her with words.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, surveyed his surroundings. This must have been the girl's original bedroom. With its pink theme and princess bed, it was very warm and lovely. It was just a pity that its owner was now in a state of delirium.\n\nWhat struck Zhou Ze as odd was, if this girl wasn't a ghost, then where did her \"Children's Opera\" and those incredibly precise verdicts come from?\n\n\"Children's Opera\" was a local Tongcheng art form that only some elderly people still listened to. Young people today might not have even heard of it, yet the girl had just performed it very professionally.\n\nCould it be that the chaotic fusion of her two personalities had created a new one, and this new personality possessed such a special ability?\n\nDon't people often say that genius and madness are separated by a thin line?\n\nBut on second thought, that didn't seem right, though he couldn't put his finger on why.\n\n\"Where is my husband?\"\n\nJust then, the girl spoke in a very steady voice. She pushed away the nannies beside her and stood up.\n\n\"Has my husband returned home?\"\n\nWang Ke froze on the spot.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth also fell slightly agape.\n\nShe had already switched roles?\n\nTurned into the matriarch personality?\n\n\"Ah Qiu, I'm here.\" Mr. Zheng walked over at that moment, then gestured for everyone else to leave first. He needed to comfort his \"wife.\"\n\nWalking out onto the balcony, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Wang Ke asked, standing beside Zhou Ze. His hopes now rested entirely on him.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"It's not ghost possession.\"\n\n\"Is it really a mental problem then?\" Wang Ke licked his chapped lips. He was in a difficult position now, with no easy way out.\n\nIn fact, if he had initially stuck to his principles as a doctor and provided psychological treatment for the girl, things might never have developed to this point.\n\nBut it was too late to talk about that now.\n\nHowever, this wasn't entirely Wang Ke's fault. He wanted to secure the support of his investor, so naturally, he would go to great lengths to please him.\n\nBesides, seeing how Mr. Zheng immediately came in after hearing his daughter switch to his wife's personality, and hearing the tone in which he called out \"Ah Qiu,\" it was clear that a good half of the problem stemmed from the man himself.\n\n\"What's this room for?\" Zhou Ze asked, pointing to the room next to the bedroom. It was draped in white gauze, and the floor-to-ceiling windows were covered tightly.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze felt there was something inside that made him uncomfortable.\n\n\"That's the young miss's art studio,\" the young butler standing nearby said.\n\n\"Oh, may I go in and have a look?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Well...\" The butler seemed hesitant, then looked toward Wang Ke.\n\n\"Let him take a look,\" Wang Ke nodded. \"Understanding more about the young miss's situation will help with the treatment.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nThe butler immediately went to get the key, unlocked the door, and then stood outside as Zhou Ze and Wang Ke walked in together.\n\n\"You loved to draw when you were a child. I remember you once told me you wanted to be a painter,\" Wang Ke said, somewhat wistfully.\n\n\"The orphanage didn't have the resources for that back then,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nFor someone in Zhou Ze's situation at the time, learning to paint and pursuing art was truly unrealistic. That was why, after the college entrance exams, he ultimately chose medical school to make it easier to find a job and support himself.\n\n\"Don't worry. No matter how this turns out, I won't bother you again,\" Wang Ke said with a bitter smile. \"To be honest, I'm scared too. When I came to find you last time, my heart was in my throat the whole time.\"\n\n*Your daughter is a Netherworld Emissary. If you knew that, you'd probably faint on the spot.*\n\nJust then, the butler called from the doorway, \"Dr. Wang, Mr. Zheng is looking for you.\"\n\n\"I'll go see what's wrong. I'll take you with me when I leave later,\" Wang Ke said as he left the studio, leaving Zhou Ze alone.\n\nZhou Ze strolled around the studio alone, looking at the paintings on the floor and walls, somewhat lost in thought. To be honest, although these works were clearly by a young artist, each one seemed to possess a unique spiritual quality, showcasing the painter's inherent talent.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze stopped in front of an easel draped in a black cloth. Without the slightest hesitation, he reached out and pulled the cloth away. Instantly, Zhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nThe painting on the easel was of a skull.\n\nIt didn't look particularly special; after all, images of skulls like this were easy to find online.\n\nBut this particular skull gave Zhou Ze the feeling that his heart had stopped beating. Even his breathing seemed to slow to a halt.\n\nIt was a peculiar feeling, an unusual resonance.\n\nAfter taking several deep breaths to calm himself, Zhou Ze was able to examine the painting more closely. He then discovered that the skull in the painting was three-dimensional, especially on the far left, where there was a fold that created a sense of space.\n\nIt was like the difference between a flat drawing of a book cover and a three-dimensional rendering of it.\n\nThis was a copy. The girl's previous works had been in the style of quaint homes and gentle streams, but the one before him was completely different from her previous style!\n\nJudging from the painting,\n\nwhat she had copied was probably a book, or maybe a booklet?\n\nAnd the cover of that book or booklet was this skull.\n\nZhou Ze began to search the area. When the girl was painting this, she would have had the object in front of her to copy, so it was highly likely that the object was in this studio.\n\nSoon, Zhou Ze discovered a small, unlocked cabinet in the corner of the studio. He opened it and found some illustration albums and drawing books. After flipping through them, Zhou Ze finally found what he was looking for: a booklet, only the size of his palm, that looked a bit like a driver's license.\n\nHe took it out and held it in front of him. The front was that same skull, identical to the one in the painting.\n\nThat was it. What the girl had copied was this thing.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously opened the booklet, but the moment it was opened,\n\nthe girl, who had just fallen asleep in the bedroom next door, suddenly snapped her eyes open. A flash of crimson showed in her pupils, and she leaped straight off the bed. If not for the quick reflexes of the several nannies who caught and held her, she might have charged out of the bedroom.\n\n\"Mmph... Mmph...\"\n\nThe girl struggled frantically, her nails scratching several bloody lines on the nannies' faces.\n\n\"What is it now!\"\n\nMr. Zheng ran back into the bedroom again, his heart aching as he looked at his daughter in this state.\n\nAnd just a wall away, Zhou Ze remained frozen, holding the open booklet.\n\nHowever, in Zhou Ze's mind, images of men and women, old and young, flashed one after another. They appeared and disappeared quickly, but with each appearance, several lines of black, brush-stroked characters would manifest beside them, writing out their verdicts.\n\nFor a moment, the terrifying amount of information made Zhou Ze's head spin.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze threw his head back and sucked in a sharp breath, simultaneously snapping the booklet shut.\n\nThis was no ordinary skull-themed trinket.\n\nIt recorded countless departed souls and the summaries of their entire lives.\n\nIt was something Zhou Ze had never seen before.\n\nIt was then that Zhou Ze noticed a scorched mark in the center of the skull on the booklet's cover.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously touched the mark with his fingernail.\n\nAt that very moment, his black fingernail seemed to grow uncontrollably. Black energy from the nail swirled into the booklet, and the entire thing became incredibly hot to the touch. Yet he couldn't drop it; it felt as if it had been branded into his flesh.\n\nIn the next room, the girl who had been struggling wildly suddenly grew quiet. As if finally granted release, she fell into a deep slumber.\n\nThe painful sensation didn't last long, but it was enough to leave Zhou Ze drenched in sweat, as if he had just been subjected to the torture of the burning pillar!\n\n*Thud...*\n\nThe booklet fell from Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nZhou Ze hung his head, beads of sweat dripping continuously to the floor.\n\nBut he could see that on the back of the booklet, which had previously been just a plain black cover, two lines of clear, blood-red words had appeared:\n\n\"The Yin Division has its order,\n\nThe Yellow Springs can be crossed.\"",

    "content": "Picking up the booklet, Zhou Ze didn't feel the searing heat this time. Instead, it had a smooth, cool texture, as if he were holding a piece of ancient jade.\n\nA strange connection seemed to form between him and the booklet.\n\nZhou Ze had read his share of xianxia novels before, but this didn't feel like a magical artifact acknowledging its master or anything of the sort.\n\nThe booklet was still the booklet,\n\nAnd he was still him,\n\nBut for some inexplicable reason, Zhou Ze felt a sense of intimacy toward this object from the bottom of his heart, like a thirty-year-old man holding a photo of himself from when he was three or five.\n\nUnfamiliar, yet incredibly familiar.\n\nHe opened the first page, and the magnificent, overwhelming imagery assaulted him again. Zhou Ze closed his eyes, and then, all the chaotic things vanished.\n\nLast time, he had been a passive recipient of the information.\n\nThis time, it seemed he could control the floodgate.\n\nFinally, the first page was open. On it was a handprint. Zhou Ze wasn't sure if it was his or someone else's, and he couldn't do a detailed fingerprint comparison right now. But in truth, the handprint was exceedingly strange; Zhou Ze felt that no one in the world could possibly have such a print.\n\nThe lines of the handprint were so harmonious you couldn't find a single flaw. It was impeccably neat, and every detail created a very pleasant feeling.\n\nBelow it were two lines.\n\nFirst line: Name: Zhou Ze.\n\nSecond line: Position: Temporary Ghost Emissary.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had had an inkling before. This must be the so-called Ghost Emissary credential—or to be precise, an Underworld credential. After all, the Underworld was its own little society; small as a sparrow, but with all its organs intact. Ghost Emissaries were just one type of position.\n\nBack then, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had discussed his current situation. One thing was very clear: his status as a temporary worker was extremely precarious. He could be made a scapegoat at any moment, and he had no security or status to speak of.\n\nWhen the little loli had returned last time, she had directly admitted this point when he confronted her.\n\nAt the same time, she had casually drawn him a big pie,¹ not caring in the least whether he was willing to eat it.\n\nThe root of the problem was that he was missing this credential!\n\nWith this credential in hand, he was no longer undocumented.\n\nMost importantly, this credential meant he had obtained a so-called \"performance\" sheet. Just like the establishment and development of the ancient imperial examination system, it opened a channel for those at the bottom to move up.\n\nDuring his months running the bookstore, Zhou Ze had been very lazy. It wasn't that he was naturally so, but his previously awkward status meant that doing more could easily lead to more mistakes, while doing nothing wasn't a big deal.\n\nIt was similar to the mindset in those loss-making state-owned enterprises ten or twenty years ago.\n\nNow, he could at least set a small goal for himself.\n\nA hundred million was out of the question,\n\nBut there was hope that through his own efforts, he could raise his rank a little.\n\nEven a female ghost like Lady Bai, who guarded her hometown for two hundred years in the mortal realm, could accumulate enough merit to return to Hell and secure a position. His starting point was actually much better than Lady Bai's.\n\nHowever, what made Zhou Ze a bit uncomfortable was, why was his current position still just \"Temporary Ghost Emissary\"?\n\nZhou Ze knew this wasn't some credential that heaven had\n*biu*\nsent down to him on account of him being \"diligent,\" \"devoted to his sovereign's affairs,\" \"sparing no effort,\" or \"working himself to death.\"\n\nZhou Ze also knew that with his previous work attitude—working in fits and starts, spending his days drinking tea and reading novels in the bookstore, and sleeping with Bai Yingying at night—\nif heaven didn't strike him down with a bolt of lightning for being such a wicked creature, it was already showing immense mercy. How could it possibly reward him at a time like this?\n\nThis was someone else's Underworld credential,\n\nBut he had happened to pick it up.\n\nNo, to be precise, Zheng Pingping had picked it up. But Zheng Pingping was a living, ordinary person. She couldn't handle this thing at all; in fact, she suffered from its influence, her mind thrown into chaos by it.\n\nCoupled with the shock of her mother's death, this was what had caused Zheng Pingping's behavior to become erratic.\n\nShe lost her sense of self, because this booklet contained the verdicts of countless souls who had passed on. It was like making you read the life stories of thousands upon thousands of people at once.\n\nZhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly,² or returning home to find one's axe handle rotted³—these basically described the situation.\n\nYou lose yourself, ignoring all the changes around you. You were a grain of sand, and then a great river washes over you. Forget about others, could you even find yourself anymore?\n\nHowever, since he had now \"stolen\" this thing, it should also mean that the connection between Zheng Pingping and the credential had been severed. Her psychological illness should recover quickly.\n\nBut the crux of the problem was that Zhou Ze didn't think the previous owner of this thing was also a \"Temporary Ghost Emissary.\"\n\nA temporary Ghost Emissary with such an exaggerated performance record?\n\nWas everyone in Hell a model worker, a vanguard of the era?\n\nWere they all damn workaholics?\n\nLooking at that lazy little loli, she was actually quite similar to him. Otherwise, she wouldn't have pawned off her assignments on him to go earn some extra cash on the side.\n\nLooking closely, Zhou Ze noticed a faint white smudge over the original positions of his name and title, a bit like they had been covered with correction fluid.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed it, even scraped it with his fingernail, but nothing came off. The white smudge remained a white smudge.\n\nThis started to trigger Zhou Ze's obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The truth was right under the white smudge.\n\nOriginally, the information of the credential's previous owner should have been written here. It was very likely that the original owner had already kicked the bucket, and he had inherited the credential, causing the official title and other information on it to be \"refreshed.\"\n\nZhou Ze even thought about asking Bai Yingying to try scrubbing it with Tide laundry detergent when he got back to the bookstore.\n\nThe booklet had several pages. When Zhou Ze turned to the second page, he saw a very simple line of text:\n\n\"Eight Percent\"\n\n\"Is this an experience bar?\" Zhou Ze subconsciously reached up to touch his nose.\n\nActually, ancient China had long had expressions for \"fractions.\" Of course, it wasn't in the modern form of Arabic numerals with a numerator, denominator, and a line, but described directly in this manner.\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian: The Book of Celestial Offices* contained phrases like \"...three parts two... nine parts eight...\" \"Three parts two\" meant \"two-thirds,\" and \"nine parts eight\" meant \"eight-ninths.\"\n\nThe \"eight percent\" here meant eight out of a hundred.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, feeling a bit ashamed. He had previously been rather indifferent to the little loli's anger about his laziness and slacking, thinking she was making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nBut looking at it now, in the past two months, he had only completed eight percent of the tasks required of a temporary Ghost Emissary.\n\nHe really was lazy enough.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze wondered if this meant that if he completed the other ninety-two percent to make it a hundred, his \"Temporary Ghost Emissary\" status could be made official?\n\nFrom a contract worker to a tenured employee?\n\nZhou Ze hadn't cared much about this before. In his past life, he had even looked down on those who desperately tried to get into the system. Some of his classmates' families spent hundreds of thousands to get them in, and they would then earn two or three thousand a month, yet still feel superior and smug, thinking that their other classmates still struggling to build careers or fighting for a life in Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou were just \"working for others.\"\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze felt a deep, urgent desire to remove the word \"temporary\" and enter the Underworld's system!\n\nIt meant a sense of security. It meant whether he could sleep soundly tonight without worrying about not seeing tomorrow's sun.\n\nPerhaps those classmates of his from before were also seeking this kind of security. After all, of the three hundred and sixty trades, none was more stable than the iron rice bowl.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to turn to the next page, but he found the following pages were stuck together. No matter how he tried, he couldn't separate them.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nit was because of his current rank, he wasn't qualified to view the information on the next few pages?\n\nPutting the credential away, Zhou Ze stretched.\n\nWang Ke was still in the adjacent bedroom. Zheng Pingping had woken up and was slowly regaining consciousness. Wang Ke was thrilled and excited. As a veteran psychologist, he could keenly perceive that Zheng Pingping's condition was rapidly improving!\n\nHe didn't know what caused it, but he was subconsciously \"putting on a show of making an effort.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the art studio, lit another cigarette, and thought about how he would strive for success when he got back to the bookstore. In the future, when he had nothing to do, he would set up some incense and candles and put out some cold food at the bookstore entrance to attract some wandering ghosts.\n\nWhen the time came, regardless of the circumstances, he'd send them all to Hell for reincarnation.\n\nFor instance, that mother from last time who wanted to go to the underworld only after her son finished his college entrance exams—the next time Zhou Ze encountered someone like that, he definitely wouldn't just casually wave his hand and let her leave on her own.\n\nYou could say this would be a bit heartless, but the initial accumulation of capital is just that bloody.\n\nTo get his official status sooner,\n\nZhou Ze really would do whatever it took.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw Wang Ke's wife and the young butler standing by the stairwell, seemingly talking about something. Zhou Ze didn't get too close, but his ears caught phrases like \"when to get hair done again.\"\n\nAnd honestly, seeing the slightly shy yet forcedly calm expression on Wang Ke's wife's face, everything was self-evident.\n\nModern butlers were different from those of the past. This was a new profession, and a high-paying one at that. Generally, only high-end residential areas like this would have modern butlers. They were considered high-level service personnel, their prestige no less than that of \"air hostesses\" in people's eyes a decade or so ago.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wasn't going to run over and shout, denouncing the \"adulterer and adulteress.\" Wang Ke had probably guessed something, but since he, the person involved, was deliberately not exposing it, Zhou Ze, an outsider, had no reason to help.\n\nBut as his childhood friend, seeing Wang Ke being cheated on, Zhou Ze naturally felt a bit uncomfortable.\n\nMr. Zheng was standing on the balcony, smoking a cigar. His expression was slightly relaxed because Wang Ke had just told him his daughter's condition had greatly improved.\n\n\"Where does Mr. Xu work?\" Mr. Zheng was now in the mood to chat a little with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I run a book chamber.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe had no choice. Facing such a wealthy merchant, he could only try to act refined.\n\n\"Oh, very good, very good. I'll pay a visit when I have the chance,\" Mr. Zheng said politely.\n\nZhou Ze then seized the opportunity to ask, \"Was Miss Zheng incontinent just now? I'm not very talented, but I am well-versed in some remedies for regulating the mind and body and strengthening one's constitution.\"\n\nHearing this, Mr. Zheng's face suddenly darkened. He was a wealthy merchant; of course he didn't lack for good traditional Chinese doctors. What angered him was that Zhou Ze had just said to his face that his daughter had lost control of her bowels!\n\nShe had only been incontinent with urine once,\n\nand there was no poop!\n\n\"Thank you for your kind offer, sir. My daughter is just a bit mentally fatigued; there's nothing wrong with her physically.\"\n\nOne doesn't hit a smiling face. Since Zhou Ze was offering a remedy to help, Mr. Zheng naturally couldn't get angry at him.\n\nA look of obvious surprise appeared on Zhou Ze's face. He said,\n\n\"She wasn't? But the butler was just over there talking to someone about this. He said the young lady's pants were full of...\"\n\nAt this point,\n\nZhou Ze seemed to realize that saying such a thing was crude and inappropriate. He immediately let out a laugh and said,\n\n\"It's good that she's fine, it's good that she's fine.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A Chinese idiom meaning to make a grand but empty promise.\n² An allusion to a famous story from the philosopher Zhuangzi, questioning the nature of reality.\n³ An allusion to the story of the \"Rotted Axe Handle,\" about a woodcutter who loses all track of time watching two immortals play a game, only to return to his village to find centuries have passed.",

    "content": "Mr. Zheng invited the two to stay for dinner, but Zhou Ze refused, and Wang Ke refused as well, with the air of someone who had accomplished a great deed and was now fading into the background. Zhou Ze didn't call him out on it; he knew his childhood friend needed this favor from the investor, so he let him be.\n\nOn the way back, Zhou Ze didn't see the young butler, but he knew that after he had \"unintentionally\" let it slip, Mr. Zheng had said a few words to his two followers, and then the butler had disappeared.\n\nWang Ke's wife was driving again. She seemed somewhat distracted, glancing at her phone from time to time.\n\nWang Ke himself was immersed in the emotional aftermath of \"surviving a disaster.\" With Miss Zheng's condition rapidly improving, the pressure was off him.\n\nZhou Ze didn't tell Wang Ke about the butler or the fact that he had deliberately bad-mouthed him in front of Mr. Zheng. It was just something he'd done on a whim out of boredom, and he wasn't about to seek any credit for it.\n\nThe key problem was that Zhou Ze didn't know which way Wang Ke's emotional loyalties leaned. Although they had grown up together, so many years had passed. Everyone has their own experiences and, naturally, their own changes.\n\nWhat if, after telling him, Wang Ke thought:\n\n\"I treat you like a brother, but you want to take off the green hat on my head!\"\n\nDespicable,\nOutrageous,\nIntolerable!\n\nWhat then?\n\nLooking again at Wang Ke's wife driving, his own sister-in-law, Zhou Ze gave a slight smirk.\n\nTruly,\nA wife's heart is like a knife.\n\nHis phone rang. Zhou Ze answered. It was his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, my sister has started going back to work,\" his sister-in-law said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze replied unhurriedly.\n\n\"She hasn't been feeling well recently. You should go see her. Don't let her get too tired,\" his sister-in-law added.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I say, what's with you? This young lady is tipping you off, and not only do you not thank me, but you don't even show a sliver of excitement.\nOh, oh, oh, 'oh,' your head!\nLet me tell you, you still haven't explained that Maserati thing clearly!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. His sister-in-law was really trying to help him. The reason was simple: lately, when she went out to have fun, her excuse was that she was at his bookstore studying.\nHer older sister was too busy with work, and although her brother-in-law was a useless bum, at least this useless bum was a college graduate and could help with her homework.\nA great reason, and a great excuse.\nEven the Lin parents, who had always looked down on Xu Le, had tacitly approved of their younger daughter going to the bookstore for tutoring.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze really had to stop himself from going back to the Lin residence, pointing at the Lin parents' noses, and telling them that forget a college graduate,\neven if you got a sophomore or junior in college to tutor a high school student, see how many of them could actually do it?\n\nBut his sister-in-law did have some conscience. This silly girl, judging from the last few incidents, aside from being a bit foolish, was an alright person.\nAnd here she was, specially tipping him off.\n\n\"Alright, thanks a lot,\" Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n\"Hmph. By the way, I'm still coming over to your place to read tonight,\" his sister-in-law added.\n\nAfter hanging up, Zhou Ze stretched, only to realize with surprise that the car was just passing the west gate of the People's Hospital.\nWhat a coincidence.\nHe hadn't planned on going.\nOf course, Zhou Ze didn't ask Wang Ke's wife to stop. He just pretended he hadn't seen it, not wanting to press his luck.\n\nDr. Lin was back at work, which meant she had recovered somewhat. But Zhou Ze had just gotten his license and was preparing to go all out to secure a permanent position soon. For now, he didn't have the energy for other distractions.\n\nHowever, Wang Ke's wife took the initiative and turned the car into the hospital.\n\n\"My father-in-law was hospitalized recently. I'm just stopping by to see him. I'll be quick,\" Wang Ke said apologetically to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Never mind, I'll just get going.\"\nZhou Ze pushed the car door open and got out.\nWang Ke got out with him. Wang Ke's wife drove the car into the hospital's underground parking garage.\n\n\"You'll take a taxi back?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Alright then, brother, take care.\" Wang Ke reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder. \"I won't actively seek you out again, but if you need anything, you can come find me.\"\n\n\"You're too kind,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAfter speaking, Wang Ke took another long, hard look at Zhou Ze, then turned and walked towards the inpatient building.\n\nZhou Ze silently lit a cigarette. People really do change.\nWang Ke was a few years older than him and had entered the workforce earlier. His old Brother Wang, Brother Erdan, now seemed somewhat of a stranger to Zhou Ze.\nDriven to desperation, to the point of consulting ghosts and spirits,\nSigh.\n\nZhou Ze blew out a smoke ring. He thought for a moment, then walked into the emergency building ahead.\nIf he hadn't heard his sister-in-law's tip-off, he could have avoided coming.\nWhen the car passed the hospital, he could have pretended not to see it.\nBut now that he was physically at the hospital, not going to see his own wife seemed a bit hard to justify.\nBefore, he had an obsession: *she won't even sleep with me*.\nHasn't that obsession disappeared now?\nNo, wait, it seemed like after that obsession was gone, some other strange problem had appeared.\n\n\"You can't even get it up, so what's the use of thinking so much? Get lost!\"\nA woman's cold voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and turned, feeling the urge for his fingernails to grow out.\n\n\"Hey, honey, didn't the doctor say there's nothing wrong with me? Maybe it's because you don't dress sexy enough, and you're not proactive enough in bed, so you can't GET my G-spot.\"\n\n\"Get lost! I'm not willing to serve you. You can't handle things in bed yourself and you want my help? Are you even a man?\"\n\nThe man and woman had probably just come from the urology department and were in the middle of a fight.\nZhou Ze's expression was a bit bitter.\nAt this moment,\nit was as if that diligent crow had appeared again, flying over his head,\nletting out \"Caw... caw... caw...\" sounds.\nOn the ground, a fallen leaf just happened to appear, blown by the wind, tumbling over Zhou Ze's foot.\n\nZhou Ze no longer wanted to go to the emergency building.\nHe felt he should give Dr. Lin more time to think, to accept, to adapt, and that he shouldn't provoke her at a time like this.\nYes,\nhe should be more considerate of her, give her more time and space. He couldn't force her.\nZhou Ze nodded, feeling he had convinced himself, and prepared to leave.\n\nBut just then, an ambulance drove into the hospital, and Zhou Ze saw several doctors and nurses run out from the emergency building, among them a familiar figure.\nDr. Lin also saw Zhou Ze. For a moment, she froze. Zhou Ze gave her a slight smile, walked over, and said gently:\n\"I was just about to go up and see you.\"\n\nDr. Lin suddenly clutched her lower abdomen and sat down on the steps.\n\"What's wrong? Are you unwell?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nDr. Lin shook her head and said, \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"What's really wrong with your body?\" Zhou Ze asked in detail. He remembered his sister-in-law telling him that Dr. Lin had been feeling unwell these past few days.\n\n\"It's a woman's thing,\" Dr. Lin said, lowering her head.\nThe ice goddess, at this moment, showed a hint of bashfulness.\n*She's on her period?*\nZhou Ze was speechless. Perhaps, for a silly girl like his sister-in-law, getting her period was the most painful thing imaginable.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, the patient's condition is a bit serious. It's a pregnant woman.\"\nA young male doctor came rushing over, pushing a stretcher. He seemed a little nervous. Then, when he looked at Zhou Ze, his expression changed, and he immediately said:\n\"You're here too?\"\nThe last time Zhou Ze had come to the hospital, he had performed a rescue surgery and incidentally confessed to Dr. Lin. This was the intern who had been at a complete loss that day.\n\n\"Get her inside first. I'll take a look.\"\nDr. Lin forced herself to stand, preparing to check the patient's condition.\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow them inside.\n\nAfter entering the emergency building, the young girl who had accompanied the pregnant woman kept asking the male intern questions. The intern couldn't quite handle it and was panicking badly.\n\n\"Do you even know how to treat people? Hurry up! Can't you see how much pain my sister is in? What's happening with the baby? My brother is already thirty, it took so long for them to have this child, do you know how hard it was!\"\n\n\"I... you wait... let me check again...\" The male intern began to get nervous, even dropping his clipboard.\n\n\"You what? Hey, are there any other doctors here? You can't just be so reckless with people's lives!\" the young woman continued to shout.\n\n\"I'll go take a look.\" Dr. Lin, from behind, quickened her pace to check the situation, but after a few steps, she winced in pain again.\n\n\"Your problem is a bit serious,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Irregular diet recently has weakened your body.\"\nDr. Lin didn't say anything, but she continued walking towards the patient.\n\n\"Forget it, I'll go have a look.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Dr. Lin on the small of her back.\n\"You...\" Dr. Lin felt this was somewhat inappropriate.\n\n\"You don't trust my medical skills?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"You were trained by me, after all.\"\n*It's just that, back then, I never imagined you'd become so beautiful. My blindness was my mistake.*\n\nZhou Ze took the initiative and walked over to the patient, preparing to examine her.\nThe young woman immediately yelled, \"Who are you? Hey, what are you doing!\"\nZhou Ze wasn't wearing a white coat.\n\n\"Doctor, please come and take a look,\" the intern said, as if he had found his savior.\nZhou Ze glanced at the young woman and said, \"I was about to get off work. If you don't want me to look, I'll go home.\"\n\nThe young woman immediately put on a smile and said, \"I'm sorry, I was wrong. Please, take a look at my sister. She's not due yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the gloves from the intern, performed an examination, and asked:\n\"How far along is the pregnancy?\"\n\n\"28 weeks,\" the young girl answered for her sister.\nThe intern looked at Zhou Ze, assisting him on the side.\n\n\"Premature rupture of membranes, cervix fully dilated, and severe meconium staining,\" Zhou Ze said as he took off his gloves.\n\n\"This... does this mean... it's...\" The young girl was terrified.\n\n\"Premature birth,\" Zhou Ze uttered the two words, then said to the intern, \"Notify the obstetrics department to prepare for surgery.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The intern immediately took out his phone and made the call.\nZhou Ze shook his head with some exasperation. This guy was lucky he hadn't been assigned to him for his internship. Otherwise, given his temper with Dr. Lin back in the day, he might have cursed this guy into changing careers. He was so damn stupid.\n\n\"Premature birth?\" The young girl was stunned when she heard this, then grabbed Zhou Ze's arm and said, \"Doctor, I'm begging you, please save my sister, save the baby in her belly. It wasn't easy for my brother to have this child, it really wasn't easy.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained unmoved. As a doctor, he had seen this sort of thing too many times. If he shed tears for every case, he'd probably shrivel up into a human raisin.\n\"Then you should go ask your brother what happened. It wasn't easy to have a child, so how did it end up like this?\"\n\n\"Doctor, what exactly happened?\" The young woman was a little confused.\n\n\"This was caused by unclean and overly vigorous sexual activity during pregnancy, with a large amount of internal ejaculation.\"\nZhou Ze looked at the woman on the hospital bed and asked:\n\"A man in the heat of the moment is a beast, but couldn't you have tried to reason with him for the sake of the child in your womb?\"\n*Almost thirty weeks pregnant, and he couldn't even hold back for that long?*\n\nThe pregnant woman on the bed said nothing, looking very nervous and scared.\nBut the young girl who came with her exploded, shouting:\n\"That's impossible! My brother went to Beijing to work before the New Year to earn money for baby formula, and he hasn't been back for the past six months!\"\n\n\"I fell in love with a wild horse, but there's no prairie in my home...\"\nThe male intern's phone ringtone went off. He immediately answered the call, then said to Zhou Ze:\n\"Obstetrics said the operating room is ready.\"",

    "content": "\"She was sent to OB/GYN.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down next to Dr. Lin. Seeing her face, which still looked pained, he said:\n\n\"You should get more rest. Otherwise, you're being irresponsible.\"\n\n\"I can handle it.\" Dr. Lin shook her head, still stubborn.\n\n\"I mean that in your physical condition, you're being irresponsible toward your patients.\"\n\n\"...\" Dr. Lin was speechless.\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze licked his lips and said apologetically, \"Sorry, I unconsciously slipped back into my old self.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Dr. Lin said softly.\n\n\"Go home and rest. Come back to work after you've recovered. A doctor's job is important, but society won't stop running just because there's one less doctor working for a while.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID; it was Xu Qinglang.\n\nHe stood up, walked out to the hallway entrance, and answered the phone:\n\n\"Hello, what's up?\"\n\n\"Business is good at your place today. You should come back and take a look,\" Xu Qinglang said, yawning.\n\n\"Good business?\" Zhou Ze was a little pleased. He'd just gotten his license, and results were already showing up at his door?\n\n\"Okay, I'll be right back.\"\n\nZhou Ze decided that this time, no matter how many stories more tragic than *The Injustice to Dou E*¹ the lost souls in the bookstore told, he would be impartial and send them to Hell.\n\nThey were lost souls.\n\nSending them to Hell was their proper path. Being impartial, he wouldn't have any psychological burden.\n\n\"If you have something to do, you should go.\" Dr. Lin pointed to her office. \"I'll go home on my own in a bit.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said no more. Right now, nothing was more important than becoming a full-fledged emissary sooner. As for his relationship with Dr. Lin, that could develop slowly.\n\nThe elevators in the emergency building were packed, even at night, so Zhou Ze opted to take the stairs. When he reached the third floor, he suddenly stopped.\n\nFor some reason, he had a feeling that someone was following him.\n\nCould it be Dr. Lin, wanting to look at him a bit longer but too shy to do it openly, so she was secretly following him?\n\nWell, while that was a possibility, Zhou Ze wasn't narcissistic enough to actually believe it. He quickly walked down another flight of stairs, then whipped around at the landing and headed back up.\n\n*Whoosh...*\n\nA gust of wind blew past from above.\n\nZhou Ze snapped his head up and started running upstairs, but he still didn't find anything.\n\nFinding nothing proved that something was definitely amiss.\n\nZhou Ze bent down, his index fingernail turned black and elongated, and he lightly tapped the tiled floor.\n\nThe next moment, a black footprint appeared on the tiled floor. Zhou Ze silently clenched his fist, hiding his index finger, then slowly stood up and followed the direction of the black footprints that continued to appear below.\n\nFrom his fingernail, an invisible smoke, unseen by the naked eye of ordinary people, continuously emanated, tracking the marks below.\n\nDue to its special nature, a hospital is rarely ever completely clean. But it wasn't the dead of night yet, so for a \"filthy thing\" to dare wander around so brazenly was highly unusual.\n\nFollowing the prints, Zhou Ze arrived on the fourth floor. The footprints led down the hall and turned into a patient room.\n\nThere were patients in the room. Given the current extreme strain on medical resources, finding an empty patient room was a rare event. For instance, right now, some patients could only rest or receive IV drips on simple cots in the hallway.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the door to the patient room.\n\nInside were three beds.\n\nOld women lay on the two side beds, and a young woman lay in the middle one. Each bed had a companion sitting beside it.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked in, everyone in the room, except for one sleeping old woman, looked at him.\n\n\"Hello, sorry to bother you. Did anyone just come in here?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, getting straight to the point.\n\n\"No,\" a middle-aged female companion answered.\n\nThe others also shook their heads.\n\nZhou Ze nodded to show he understood, then turned to leave the room.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze decided to leave.\n\nYou couldn't blame Zhou Ze for lacking a sense of public duty, for not catching a ghost he'd encountered. After all, Xu Qinglang had just called to say that business was \"very good\" at his shop. Zhou Ze was worried that if he returned late, his customers would be gone, and that would be a huge loss.\n\nAs for the filthy thing running around outside, if he ran into it, he'd deal with it if he could. But if it was troublesome or wanted to play hide-and-seek with him, Zhou Ze really wasn't willing to spend too much energy on it.\n\nHe was a ghost emissary—and one with the prefix \"temporary\" at that—not Zhang Tianshi.²\n\nHowever, as Zhou Ze grabbed the doorknob to close the door, his fingernail accidentally brushed against it.\n\nIn that instant, Zhou Ze felt what seemed like a jolt of static electricity. Immediately after, the lights in the room went out, then came back on again.\n\nThe three beds in the room were instantly empty. The patients, along with their companions, had all vanished.\n\nZhou Ze stumbled back two steps. Only then did he see the sign on the door of the room he was facing: \"Storage Room.\" This wasn't a patient room!\n\n*Whoosh...*\n\nAnother gust of wind blew past, very fast, as if the creature had realized its illusion had failed and was trying to make a hasty escape.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed something that felt cold and fleshy, but it was immediately followed by a crisp tearing sound as the thing slipped from his grasp.\n\nThe wind dissipated.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his palm. There was a tuft of long, curly black hair, like the hair from that other dense region he saw every day in the shower, besides the hair on his head.\n\nAs if out of professional habit, Zhou Ze brought his palm to his nose and sniffed.\n\nA thick, foul, fishy stench assaulted him, utterly nauseating, like the smell of a salted fish left in a stuffy warehouse for a month.\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nZhou Ze suppressed the urge to gag. He crouched down again, tapped the tile with his fingernail, and another series of clear, black footprints appeared.\n\nHe dusted off his hands, cracked his neck, and then followed the footprints once more.\n\nThe nature of the situation had changed again. If the entity had just been like that old woman lingering in the affiliated hospital's morgue over family assets, Zhou Ze wouldn't have given chase. After all, there were far too many ghosts like that, lingering in the mortal world due to earthly attachments, exposed to the elements. They generally had neither the inclination nor the ability to cause any real trouble.\n\nBut the one he'd just encountered had not only actively stalked him, it had also created an illusion so realistic it had almost fooled him. Furthermore, judging by the body hair he'd ripped from it, the thing had a physical form.\n\nThis meant it was capable of causing trouble, and in the very hospital where his wife worked, no less. It was now difficult for Zhou Ze to convince himself to stand by and do nothing with a clear conscience.\n\nIn the end,\n\nhe was just a glutton for punishment!\n\nZhou Ze had read a lot of novels in his bookstore over the past few months, and he hated the saintly protagonists the most—he couldn't relate to them at all. But when it was his turn, he found he still couldn't bring himself to completely walk away.\n\nOf course, there was another extremely important reason: he had just become a ghost emissary. Based on the information he could glean from his past conversations with the little loli, if a filthy thing caused trouble in a ghost emissary's territory, that emissary would also face the consequences.\n\nThe footprints went upstairs. Zhou Ze followed them all the way to the eighth floor, which was the operating room level. Once he got off the stairs, it didn't take him long to find his target.\n\nA figure in a white doctor's coat was leaning against the wall in a corner near the operating rooms. It had one ear pressed to the wall while its other hand was thrusting rhythmically below, doing something many otaku do at home.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze approached, the figure didn't turn around, but Zhou Ze saw its body tremble slightly and the speed of its hand's friction-inducing movements increase, as if his arrival had somehow enhanced its pleasure.\n\n\"You are a ghost emissary. I do not wish to offend you, but why must you pursue me so relentlessly? We can easily mind our own business.\"\n\nThe creature's voice was hoarse, like an old man's, but its intonation was strange, often rushing through several syllables with extreme speed.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Zhou Ze gestured at it.\n\n\"I am waiting for my woman to come out,\" the creature replied. \"Lord Emissary, you should go back. Tearing away all pretense is good for no one. I can guarantee you that I will not do anything heinous that would make things difficult for you.\n\n\"With the Heavenly Dao above, I too dare not act recklessly.\"\n\n\"Your woman? Who are you waiting for?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nCould this be another case of *Ghost*?\n\nBut just then, from the other end of the operating room hallway, the young girl who had accompanied her sister-in-law ran out, holding a stack of bills, likely on her way to pay for the procedure.\n\nInside...\n\nwas the pregnant woman who was about to miscarry!\n\n\"You are not her husband,\" Zhou Ze snapped.\n\n\"'The woman I've taken a fancy to is my woman. Besides, she and I have a fateful, tragic bond to continue. This is something even Old Man Heaven has tacitly approved of,\" the creature said, its tone extremely impatient.\n\nZhou Ze had been the one to initially examine the pregnant woman. At first, he thought he'd stumbled upon another cuckolding incident. He had even lamented how he himself had faced a similar problem, how his childhood friend was currently going through one, and now, even a random patient he saw in the hospital was involved in one.\n\nIt seemed that wherever he went lately, he ran into this \"environmentally-friendly color.\"\n\nHe even had the urge to rename his bookstore the \"Green Bookstore\" to answer the nation's call to protect the environment.\n\nFortunately, this time it wasn't a simple, melodramatic green-hat situation. But it seemed even more troublesome than a simple green-hat situation.\n\n\"One body, two lives,\" Zhou Ze reminded it, taking two steps forward. \"If her surgery is unsuccessful, it will be one body, two lives. And you still claim you're not doing anything heinous?\"\n\n\"You ghost emissary, you've got some nerve!\"\n\nThe creature seemed unable to contain its rage anymore.\n\nIt spun around.\n\nIt was wearing a doctor's white coat, so its back hadn't revealed much. But when it turned to face him, its terrifying and ferocious appearance was instantly revealed.\n\nIt was a monkey—\n\na monkey that could stand upright like a human.\n\nMost of its body was horribly rotten, and even its skull was partially missing, the inside empty. But the thing below its waist swung back and forth like a bull's pizzle, looking utterly disgusting.\n\n\"You are nothing but a lowly ghost emissary from the very bottom of the Underworld. Don't push your luck!\"\n\n\"And what kind of thing are you?\" Zhou Ze retorted, taking a few more steps forward.\n\n\"Screech! Screech! Screech!\"\n\nThe monkey bared its fangs, letting out a low growl. Then, the black tail on its back suddenly shot up and plunged violently into the tiled floor.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nsmall black holes appeared all around where Zhou Ze stood—on the ceiling, the floor tiles, and the walls.\n\nLong tails emerged from these holes and began to swarm toward him.\n\nThe tails carried an extremely foul stench and dripped with mucus. For Zhou Ze, who had always been a neat freak, it felt like he was standing in the smelliest section of a seafood market.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nthis scene...\n\nhe had seen it before,\n\nin many movies.\n\nImmediately,\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands, his black fingernails growing out completely. A black light also swirled in the depths of his eyes.\n\nTo be honest, aside from that time he'd whipped Bai Yingying, he hadn't really been in a proper fight.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze was that the booklet in his pocket suddenly began to grow slightly hot, as if it, too, was impatient.\n\nA little excited,\n\nand a little expectant.\n\nHe had just gotten his license. It was like someone who'd just passed their driving test and was itching to take a car for a spin.\n\nRight now, Zhou Ze really wanted to fight.\n\nHowever, a scene that greatly surprised Zhou Ze occurred. Just as his credentials began to grow warm,\n\nthe monkey, which a moment ago had been insufferably arrogant and scornful of him as a mere lowly ghost emissary of the Underworld, suddenly dropped to its knees. It began kowtowing repeatedly, banging its head on the floor, and shouting:\n\n\"Spare me, Lord Judge! Spare me! This vile beast knows its mistake! This vile beast knows its mistake!\"\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze, who had been full of fighting spirit, was left hanging, neither up nor down.\n\nIt was like a man who had done all the foreplay, applied the delay spray, taken Viagra, put on the chocolate-flavored condom, cued up the porn, and poured the red wine,\n\nonly for the beauty on the bed to pull back the covers and reveal that it was fucking Xu Qinglang!\n\n---\n¹ *The Injustice to Dou E* is a famous classical Chinese play about a young woman who is wrongly convicted and executed, a symbol of great injustice.\n² Zhang Tianshi refers to Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master of Taoism, a powerful figure known for exorcising demons and ghosts.",

    "content": "My Lord?\n\nThat was definitely not addressed to him. The first column on Zhou Ze's ID card clearly stated his name, and the second column stated, unequivocally, his position as a \"Temporary Ghost Emissary.\"\n\nBesides, it couldn't be a term of respect, like back in the Republic era when common folk would see any soldier and call him \"General.\" If even a temporary ghost emissary could be called \"My Lord,\" then wouldn't that title be far too common and worthless in Hell?\n\nSo,\n\nthe problem must lie with this little booklet he had just obtained.\n\nThis ID card had a previous owner. Even though it had been \"refreshed\" now that Zhou Ze possessed it, some residual information from its former master must have remained.\n\nIn short,\n\nhe had picked up the relic of a very impressive fellow, and he had done so with absolutely no effort.\n\nOf course, at this moment, Zhou Ze had no time to gloat or indulge in the luxury of opening a bottle of red wine to celebrate. Instead, he felt a small pang of disappointment, for he hadn't been able to fight this uglified version of Brother Monkey.\n\nBut since his opponent had chickened out, Zhou Ze certainly wasn't perverse enough to squat down and encourage his opponent to quickly regain his confidence, stand up, and hit me, hit me,\n\nhit me!\n\nSince this was a beautiful misunderstanding, then let the misunderstanding continue.\n\nZhou Ze walked silently toward the monkey, one hand clasped behind his back. He was, in fact, subconsciously imitating the little loli's cool pose to prolong the other party's misunderstanding.\n\nHe reached the creature. The monkey was still kowtowing nonstop. Its skull looked like it had been pried open, and it was hollow inside. In fact, aside from its perfectly preserved \"bull's pizzle,\" its entire body was decayed and damaged.\n\nZhou Ze extended a hand, the tip of his nail touching the spot between its eyebrows.\n\n\"Hand over your soul blood to me,\" Zhou Ze said faintly.\n\n\"I humbly obey My Lord's decree.\"\n\nThe monkey, its face full of fear, was utterly convinced. At the spot between its eyebrows, a black earthworm appeared.\n\nZhou Ze pinched the earthworm with his nail and began to pull it out. The earthworm grew longer and thicker.\n\nXu Qinglang had once suggested that Zhou Ze take Bai Yingying's soul blood, which would be equivalent to controlling her very life. Zhou Ze now intended to use the same method to gain complete control over this monkey while it was scared out of its wits.\n\nHowever, this monkey's soul blood was truly thick and strong, which was a testament to how terrifying the creature was.\n\nWhy had a monkey like this suddenly appeared in the city?\n\nJust then, the soul blood suddenly got stuck. Zhou Ze pulled hard, but it wouldn't budge.\n\nAnd the monkey, which had been wearing a look of reverence, froze for a second. Its gaze suddenly became incomparably clear!\n\nThe high and mighty Lord wanted to draw out its soul blood; this was its honor, a decree it could not resist. But why was the high and mighty Lord having such a hard time drawing out its soul blood?\n\nAbruptly, the monkey's mouth split open, letting out a piercing shriek as its claws swiped directly at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt as if he'd been hit by a large truck. But just as he was sent flying, his fingernails exerted a final burst of strength and directly snapped the creature's soul blood.\n\n*Crash...*\n\nZhou Ze shattered the glass window behind him and fell into a pile of broken shards. He lifted his head, his chest heaving, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. His entire body ached with excruciating pain.\n\n\"Damn you, you are not My Lord!\n\nYou bastard, how dare you impersonate My Lord!\"\n\nThe monkey went berserk. Although its soul blood hadn't been completely extracted by Zhou Ze, the fact that it had been snapped, while not enough to kill it instantly, was enough to destroy the foundation of its cultivation.\n\nZhou Ze forced himself to climb up. His body was covered in cuts from the glass shards, and he was in a sorry state.\n\nHowever, the monkey, now like a rabid beast, lunged straight at him.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nMan and monkey collided, but this time the monkey's strength was much less than before. The two of them grappled with each other, rolling over and over on the ground.\n\n\"This is my destiny, and my karma! The Heavenly Dao permits it. A debt must be paid—it is the law of heaven and earth!\n\nYou, a mere ghost emissary, why do you interfere? Do you really think you're one of the Ten Yama Kings?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Instead, he drove his fingernails viciously into the monkey's body. The pus inside the monkey's body continuously evaporated outwards, and the stench was so foul a gas mask probably wouldn't have helped at all.\n\nFinally, after a round of scuffling, the monkey's body went limp and fell to one side. Zhou Ze staggered to his feet, his ten fingernails now mostly corroded.\n\nHe was a man who cherished his nails. Even in his past life, when he wasn't wielding a scalpel, he often manicured them. Now that his nails were even more important to him in this life, he naturally treasured them even more.\n\nBut this was no time to worry about such things. A lingering fear crept into Zhou Ze's heart. If the ID card in his hand hadn't deceived his opponent, allowing him to gain the upper hand and snap its soul blood, the one lying on the ground right now would probably have been him.\n\nThis wasn't a ghost.\n\nThis was a demon.\n\nZhou Ze cursed himself many times in his head.\n\nWhy did I have to follow it? I nearly got myself killed.\n\nHumans are just this kind of complex animal. They can be spurred by a momentary sense of justice and so-called conscience to do things without considering the consequences, but then they often regret it bitterly,\n\nthinking themselves an idiot.\n\nZhou Ze thought that next time he encountered something like this, he should call Uncle Policeman and let them handle it. That way, he could leave with a clear conscience.\n\nDidn't Lady Bai stay in Tongcheng for two hundred years while the little loli turned a blind eye?\n\nShaking his head, Zhou Ze cast aside the miscellaneous thoughts in his mind and looked at the monkey beside him.\n\nThe monkey's mouth was open, its gaze growing cloudy. Its body began to shrivel like a leaking balloon, but it wasn't dead yet, because it could still speak.\n\n\"I cultivated for three sixty-year cycles, received opportunities, created good karma, became a spirit, and glimpsed the Great Dao... As a non-human, attaining the Dao in the mortal world is truly not easy.\"\n\nIt seemed everyone liked to reminisce about their past before they died, to make their life sound as incredible and difficult as possible. This monkey's mindset wasn't much different from a human's.\n\n\"You've cultivated for so many years, yet you still can't control that thing down there.\" Zhou Ze spat out a mouthful of blood, his teeth stained red.\n\n\"A new body every sixty-year cycle, a reincarnation every sixty-year cycle.\" The monkey's voice was growing weak, but it still rang with great power.\n\n\"Every sixty years, I was reborn into a new physical body to cultivate, starting from scratch, cultivating from the very beginning. In the mountains, I rescued lost travelers, gathered herbs for the villagers at the foot of the mountain, and drove away nearby mountain monsters and ghosts.\n\nThough I had no temple, I performed the duties of a mountain god, protecting the people of the region generation after generation. Even now, there is a stone carving of me in that small town, and the local story of a divine monkey helping people is still told.\"\n\nZhou Ze wiped his fingernails on his clothes. Looking at the badly damaged nails, he felt a great sense of pity. Of course, as for what the monkey was saying, Zhou Ze just gave a cold sneer.\n\nA divine monkey?\n\nA mountain god protecting the mountain folk?\n\nFinding joy in helping others?\n\nYour joy in helping others went a bit too far, didn't it? The husband goes out to work, and you go and help comfort his lonely wife in her chambers?\n\nAnd, thinking back to the image of this thing pressed against the wall playing with itself when he first came upstairs, it was really hard to associate it with a divine monkey.\n\n\"Stop putting on a one-man show, only telling the good parts.\" Zhou Ze raised his hand again, preparing to put an end to this monkey.\n\n\"It was them. During my fourth cycle of cultivation, they captured my newly reincarnated body. At that time, I was just a small monkey. Her husband was a lumberjack in the forest. He fell and was injured in a ravine. It was I who brought him fruits and dew. It was I who went to their camp and led his coworkers to rescue him.\n\nBut when he was rescued, he bound me with the rope he used for logging and said to his coworkers:\n\n'Surviving a great catastrophe is a sign of future blessings. I've heard that monkey brain is a great delicacy. I'll take it for my wife to try; it's said to have a wondrous effect on infertility!'\"\n\nThe last part was spoken by the monkey in classical Chinese. This could show its fury, and also that it was on the verge of death, its consciousness gradually fading, subconsciously speaking in the way it was most accustomed to.\n\n\"They cracked open my head, took my marrow, carved my flesh, and shared it among them to eat, saying it was a great restorative!\"\n\nAs the monkey spoke, its body, which had already shrunk to the size of a normal monkey, began to tremble. This was a teeth-grinding rage, a rage that penetrated to the very marrow of its bones!\n\nCultivating for one hundred and eighty years, performing good deeds and accumulating merit, protecting a region, only to be destroyed on the eve of great success. Not by its own enemies, but by the hands of someone it had saved.\n\nAnyone in its place would feel a monstrous hatred.\n\n\"My physical body is destroyed, my path to the Great Dao has collapsed, but the hatred in my heart cannot be quelled!\n\nYesterday's cause is today's effect!\n\nMy body is dead and my Dao has vanished. I am willing to enter reincarnation and be reborn into the animal realm, but the grievance in my heart is too great to be resolved. My soul cannot enter Hell, so I can only come down from the mountain to seek revenge and settle this karmic debt, so that I may be completely liberated.\"\n\n\"Is that your reason for violating his wife?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"You are human, I am an animal. For you, it is the law of heaven and earth that humans eat animals! But for an animal to repay humans with hatred is unacceptable to the Heavenly Dao, is it not?\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"It is.\"\n\nHe was unwilling to deny it, nor did he want to.\n\nOf course, eating monkey brain was illegal and wrong. But from Zhou Ze's own emotional standpoint, he still couldn't accept this monkey coming down the mountain for revenge and nearly causing the deaths of a mother and her unborn child.\n\nIt's like when you see people in a restaurant eating braised pork, you might think, \"Oh, that looks delicious.\"\n\nBut if you saw a group of pigs in a restaurant devouring human flesh, how would you, as a human, feel?\n\nIt was a very selfish stance, a very biased position, but that's just how it was. Everyone's position is different, so their perspective on things is naturally different.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze felt that no matter what, the baby in the pregnant woman's belly was innocent.\n\n\"You're in a lot of pain, aren't you? Let me help you find release. Then I'll see if I can send your soul to Hell.\"\n\n\"Th...ank...\" the monkey uttered its last word.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails pierced the monkey's body again.\n\nThe monkey's body trembled,\n\nand then all signs of life were gone.\n\nBut Zhou Ze searched for a long time, and waited for a long time, yet he couldn't find the monkey's departed soul.\n\nThis probably meant the monkey's soul had completely scattered. Because its revenge was not complete, its soul was not allowed to enter Hell.\n\nStanding up, Zhou Ze noticed a faint black mist dissipating around him. It seemed to be a barrier that had prevented what happened here from being perceived by the outside world. Otherwise, with the commotion he and the monkey had made, they would have attracted a lot of people by now.\n\nZhou Ze hoisted the monkey's corpse onto his shoulder and, steadying himself on the staircase railing, slowly made his way down.\n\nAt the same time, he admonished himself to remember today's lesson. He was just a ghost emissary, in charge of ghosts. Mountain spirits and demons like this were outside his jurisdiction.\n\nUnder the cover of night, Zhou Ze went to a park on the outskirts of the hospital. He found a shovel left by the gardener's shed and dug a hole for the monkey, burying its body inside.\n\nThen he tended to his own wounds simply. After all this was done, Zhou Ze leaned against a large tree, exhausted, and sat down.\n\nHe took out his phone, which still worked despite its cracked screen, and sent a message to Doctor Lin:\n\n\"Are the pregnant woman and her baby safe?\"\n\nFive minutes later, Doctor Lin replied:\n\n\"They're safe. Mother and son are both fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, which was immediately followed by a sharp pain in his lungs, sending him into a violent coughing fit.\n\nBut soon, Doctor Lin sent another photo and a line of text.\n\n\"But, the child is deformed. It has three legs.\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at the photo on his phone.\n\nThe small, premature infant lay there quietly, breathing evenly.\n\nBut its lower body had three legs.\n\nThat extra leg...\n\n...looked like a monkey's... tail.",

    "content": "His body was weary and his mind was adrift. Tossing away the cigarette butt, he slung his jacket over his shoulder and walked along the dimly lit yellow path, guided by the streetlights.\n\nHis shadow was stretched long behind him.\n\nAt the park exit stood an old man with white hair. The old man was dressed in a crisp, sharp suit, standing ramrod straight and meticulously composed, like an old poplar tree standing firm in the desert.\n\nA single glance was enough to know that the old man was the type who demanded an extreme, almost pathological, standard for his appearance and attire.\n\nZhou Ze didn't look at him, continuing on his way.\n\nThe air was filled with the scent of watermelon slushie—a little sweet, a little cloying. The smell made Zhou Ze uncomfortable, because watermelon flesh was red, and that reminded him of many unpleasant images.\n\n\"Sir, are you feeling down?\"\n\nThe old man began to follow Zhou Ze's steps, keeping just half a pace behind, a perfectly measured distance.\n\n\"A little,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe two continued to walk forward, in step with each other, creating a peculiar synchronicity.\n\n\"Sir, is it because of that monkey?\n\nOr is it for that tainted infant,\" the old man asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer, continuing to walk slowly forward.\n\nWhen he reached the traffic light, Zhou Ze stopped to wait for the green.\n\nThe old man also halted his steps.\n\n\"There is no right or wrong in this matter,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"No right or wrong?\" the old man repeated, then asked, \"But all things have two sides, a positive and a negative. Naturally, one should be able to distinguish between right and wrong.\n\nThe monkey was a good monkey. It did more good deeds than most of the so-called 'good people' in the world.\n\nThis is a point you also acknowledge, is it not, sir?\"\n\n\"So, what you're trying to say is...\" Zhou Ze pulled out another cigarette, shielding the flame from the wind as he lit it, \"I was wrong?\"\n\n\"After several transformations, after so much arduous cultivation, only to have it all come to naught because of the very person it saved—if it were you, sir, what would you feel?\" the old man asked.\n\n\"I'd be furious,\" Zhou Ze answered bluntly. That required no thought at all.\n\n\"And after the fury?\"\n\n\"If I had the chance, I'd go kill his whole family,\" Zhou Ze said, blowing a smoke ring.\n\n\"Sir, your logic is quite sound,\" the old man commented. \"But you stopped it from taking revenge. Even after you learned the full story and the truth from its own mouth, you still ended its life with your own hands.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you believe you did the right thing?\" the old man asked again.\n\n\"I've said it before, there is no right or wrong in this matter,\" Zhou Ze flicked his ash. \"And taking a massive step back, the child... was innocent.\"\n\n\"According to your logic, if the monkey had chosen to take revenge only on the husband, you would have understood.\n\nYou likely would not have intervened, is that right, sir?\"\n\nZhou Ze fell silent.\n\n\"But the reason the husband killed the monkey and took its brain was in the hopes that his wife could eat it to cure her infertility,\" the old man reminded him. \"So, while the cause and effect seem to lie between the monkey and the husband, the true source is between the monkey and that infant.\"\n\n\"Cause and effect... can it be calculated that way?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Is my calculation unreasonable?\" the old man countered.\n\n\"By your calculation, you could trace it back to a meteor hitting the Earth, wiping out the dinosaurs, allowing new species to emerge, leading to hominids, which led to humans and monkeys, which led to this tragedy.\n\nSo, the cause and effect should be blamed on the meteor.\"\n\n\"That is sophistry, sir.\" The old man's tone seemed unchanging, ever placid, as if he were purely discussing an issue with you.\n\n\"I am a human.\" Zhou Ze pointed to his own head. \"From a human standpoint, I don't think I could allow a non-human entity to harm humans in a hospital.\"\n\n\"You are not a human. You are a ghost,\" the old man reminded him again.\n\n\"Now it's your turn to use sophistry.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The old man chuckled.\n\nThe light turned green.\n\nZhou Ze strode forward, and the old man continued to follow.\n\nA young man in tattered clothes,\n\nAn old man in meticulous attire,\n\nAnd on the ground between them, only a single shadow.\n\n\"In the end, something still went wrong with the child,\" the old man continued, his tone still so calm it made you want to stab him. \"It seems at this point, one might sigh and say: The Way of Heaven is a cycle; who has it ever spared?\"\n\n\"I have never believed that a swaddled infant should bear the collective responsibility for the mistakes of adults.\"\n\n\"In ancient times, there were laws of collective punishment. This implies it had its reasons for existing,\" the old man said.\n\n\"It has now been abolished. This implies its non-existence is better than its existence.\"\n\n\"Sir, you pity that child, but who, then, pities the monkey?\"\n\n\"You can go to Flower-Fruit Mountain¹ and ask its ancestors.\"\n\n\"So, in the final analysis, it's still a theory of speciesism above all else. It's nothing more than regional or racial discrimination with an extra layer of protective coloring.\"\n\n\"I have a piece of bread in my hand. This is my dinner for today.\" Zhou Ze held out a hand, showing that he was holding a piece of bread.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then, just as I'm about to eat this bread, I suddenly remember that in some impoverished regions of the world, there are people who don't have enough to eat, who are starving to the point of emaciation.\n\nSo I can't bear to eat this piece of bread. I willingly starve along with them, and perhaps, even starve to death with them.\"\n\n\"Sir, I don't think your sarcasm is very appropriate,\" the old man shook his head. \"Can you truly consider the monkey a mere beast? Its actions over the past three sixty-year cycles have made it more of a person than most so-called people.\"\n\n\"Fine, let's try another example.\n\nI have a luxury car, and before me are fine red wine and caviar. I once again think of the starving people in the world, and again, I can't bear to indulge. I decide to starve with them, to die of hunger with them.\n\nIf you eat such fine things, if you drive such a fine car, someone will point their finger at your nose and curse you, yelling that you should donate the money you spend on luxuries to people in impoverished regions.\"\n\nThe old man stopped walking, as if in thought.\n\nZhou Ze didn't stop, continuing forward.\n\nFinally, the old man caught up.\n\n\"I am still very curious as to why you had to stop it.\"\n\n\"What do you think I should have done?\"\n\n\"Pretended you didn't see it,\" the old man replied. \"You are a Hell Messenger, a guardian of the Underworld's rules in the mortal realm. A referee is respected because of his neutrality. Once the referee also becomes a player, the game collapses.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean by that.\" Zhou Ze stopped and looked at the old man, this meticulously dressed old codger whose suit he desperately wanted to wrinkle.\n\n\"The meaning is simple. The two examples you just gave were merely to illustrate that you were simply making the choice you wanted to make at that moment, and all the questions I just pestered you with were just the noise of an outsider.\"\n\n\"I thought you didn't understand.\"\n\n\"I understood. You are a good person.\" The old man repeated himself. \"A good 'person'.\"\n\nFrom a 'human' perspective, that was indeed true.\n\n\"So, you deliberately approached me just to label me?\" Zhou Ze looked at the old man, his ten fingers still burning with a searing pain. \"I didn't realize that picking up that thing would bring trouble so quickly.\"\n\nThe little loli had said he was like an incandescent light bulb in the night. Now, Zhou Ze felt more like an incendiary bomb in the darkness.\n\nThe old man shook his head. \"I am not your trouble. In fact, I am a servant left behind by my master, and you, sir, have just inherited my master's identity token.\n\nBecause of this, my seal was broken. I have awakened, and I have found you. And, incidentally, I observed you for a while.\"\n\n\"Find a treasure, get a free grandpa?\"²\n\nA smile touched the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\n\"Should I also say:\n\n'Thirty years the river flows east, thirty years it flows west; do not bully the young and poor?'\n\nAnd maybe sigh with a 'How terrifying!'?\n\nThat seems more appropriate for the occasion.\"\n\n\"I don't understand, sir,\" the old man said frankly.\n\n\"You should read more,\" Zhou Ze advised.\n\n\"Very well.\" The old man nodded solemnly. \"I have been taught.\"\n\nAhead, they came to another red light, and the two stopped once more.\n\n\"Sir, you have inherited my master's identity token, so you have naturally become my new master,\" the old man said. At the same time, he bent at the waist, bowing deeply to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze stood his ground, watching the old man.\n\nWhat an eventful day.\n\nHe'd found an ID, killed a monkey, and now some old grandpa had popped up, wanting to call him master.\n\nZhou Ze felt no joy, only a sense of trouble. He couldn't see through this old man who had appeared out of nowhere, couldn't discern his true purpose.\n\n\"The master left an instruction for me to relay to his successor,\" the old man spoke again. \"Of course, this message is for you, and at the same time, it is for me, his servant.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"If his successor is a good person, then...\"\n\n*Thwump!*\n\nThe sound of a sharp object piercing flesh rang out.\n\nZhou Ze looked down in stunned disbelief.\n\nHe saw the old man's hand plunged directly into his chest.\n\nSo clean.\n\nSo abrupt.\n\nHe hadn't even had a shred of mental preparation.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's feet left the ground. As the old man raised his arm, Zhou Ze was lifted up with it.\n\nUnder the dim yellow streetlights, Zhou Ze could clearly see his own blood flowing down the old man's arm, staining half of his suit crimson.\n\n\"The master said, if his successor is a good person, then kill him and wait for the next one.\"\n\nThe old man spoke these words with the same calm demeanor.\n\nHe wasn't killing a person.\n\nHe was like someone tossing out the trash.\n\nLike a picky chef selecting his ingredients, discarding anything slightly unsatisfactory and replacing it with a new one.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was that piece of trash, inexplicably thrown away.\n\nBlood flowed unceasingly. The broken nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers grew out again, but before he could make his next move, the old man's hand, which had pierced through him, suddenly clenched with force.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nAn immense pain shot through every bone and fiber of Zhou Ze's body. His body convulsed, completely powerless to fight back.\n\n\"My apologies, sir. A minute ago, you might have thought this was your lucky day, because you had obtained something you greatly desired.\n\nI don't know if you noticed the blurry white spots under the name and position fields on the ID.\n\nYou probably thought that hidden beneath those white spots were the master's name and position.\n\nAnd that is, in fact, true.\n\nBut that is not all.\n\nAlso there are the names and positions of the eight successors before you.\"\n\nThe old man continued speaking calmly.\n\n\"Were... they... all... good people?\"\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth, blood constantly spilling from the corners. He felt like a piece of salted fish, hung on a tree branch,\n\nslowly, waiting to be air-dried.\n\n\"No, sir. Of the nine, you were the only good person,\" the old man replied.\n\n\"Then... why... did they... also... die...\"\n\n\"Because when I asked them if they were good people, they all thought it would be more advantageous to answer 'yes'.\"\n\nThe old man tilted his head slightly, a hint of helplessness on his face.\n\n\"And then,\n\nthey all died.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Flower-Fruit Mountain (花果山):** The mythical birthplace and home of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, from the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*. Zhou Ze is being sarcastically dismissive.\n2.  **Find a treasure, get a free grandpa?:** Zhou Ze is sarcastically referencing a common trope in Chinese web novels where a protagonist finds a magical item (like a ring or a pendant) that contains the spirit of a powerful, ancient master who then guides him to greatness. The subsequent lines, \"Thirty years the river flows east...\" and \"How terrifying!,\" are also famous clichés from this genre.",

    "content": "What does death feel like? Zhou Ze remembered with perfect clarity. He had once been pushed into the incinerator of a crematorium and enjoyed the privilege of being burned to ash.\n\nAnd before that, a crematorium worker had even used a steel hook to pierce his stomach to prevent his body from swelling and exploding during cremation.\n\nThat feeling was very similar to having his chest pierced through right now.\n\nPainful?\n\nOf course, it was painful.\n\nBut when the pain becomes too intense, you instead feel numb. It’s like undergoing surgery in a hospital after receiving a spinal anesthetic; separated by a curtain blocking your view, you can probably only feel something rummaging around on your belly.\n\nZhou Ze still wanted to fight back, but his body fell into a deathly spasm, and even his eyelids grew exceptionally heavy.\n\nNo matter how unwilling he was, no matter how much he resisted,\n\nhis eyelids…\n\nfinally fell.\n\n…………\n\nSlowly, he opened his eyes. All around was the dim glow of lamps. Before him was a long marble table, its veining chaotic yet possessing a kind of exquisite beauty.\n\nLowering his head, Zhou Ze found himself sitting in a chair. It was an ornate, high-backed armchair, and he was leaning back in it. From the neck down, he wore a white scarf, though it looked more like a bib tied on during a meal to prevent soup from staining one’s clothes.\n\nHis two hands held a silver knife and fork respectively.\n\nAnd on the pristine white plate before him lay a piece of roasted meat, steaming gently, garnished with lemon and cauliflower.\n\n\"Sir, I seared the cauliflower with a blowtorch. It should have a grilled flavor. I hope you enjoy it.\"\n\nThe old man's voice came from across the table. He was dressed in the same manner, currently cutting a piece of steak and placing it in his mouth to chew.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to eat, asking the question directly.\n\nWeren't they going to kill him?\n\n\"There was a slight accident.\" The old man picked up the wine beside him and took a small sip.\n\n*Swoosh!*\n\nThe old man placed a hand on the table and pushed the ID card toward Zhou Ze.\n\n\"For the identity card to be damaged to this extent… this is something I did not anticipate,\" the old man said, then continued to cut another piece of meat, savoring it carefully in his mouth.\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So, I am very sorry, but you will not be able to die.\" A faint smile appeared on the old man’s lips. \"Sir, your luck is truly quite good.\"\n\n\"You're not going to kill me?\"\n\n\"That is correct, sir. Because the identity card left by my master can no longer withstand another master-binding refresh. Otherwise, it will shatter completely and lose all function.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head, raised his wine glass, and gestured toward Zhou Ze.\n\n\"So, congratulations, sir. It seems my previous words were mistaken. Today is, indeed, your lucky day.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his wine glass. Staring at the translucent red color of the wine within, he didn't rush to drink, but instead asked:\n\n\"There's no strange poison in this wine, is there?\"\n\n\"You must be joking, sir.\"\n\nJoking?\n\nA moment ago, you said you were my new master.\n\nAnd then?\n\nYou plunged a hand straight through my chest!\n\nWho exactly is joking here?\n\n\"Sir, please try my cooking. When the old master was alive, I was responsible for all his daily meals. Although many years have passed, I don't believe my skills have deteriorated too much.\"\n\n\"No poison in the meat?\" Zhou Ze asked with a smile.\n\n\"Sir, you worry too much. For me, killing or torturing you would not require such troublesome methods.\"\n\n*You make a good point. I really can't argue with that.*\n\nZhou Ze used his knife to cut a piece of meat, then used his fork to deliver it to his mouth. He instinctively wanted to vomit, but was surprised to find that the meat melted in his mouth and had an excellent texture.\n\nMost importantly, he felt no sense of nausea whatsoever.\n\n\"Is it delicious?\" the old man asked.\n\n\"It's alright,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"If you find it delicious, then please have more. As a chef, it is a very happy thing to have one's dishes liked and eaten by others.\"\n\nThe old man ate half the meat on his plate, then set down his knife and fork, took out a hot towel, and wiped his hands.\n\nZhou Ze ate a few more pieces of meat, then asked:\n\n\"What happens next?\"\n\n\"Sir, you're joking again.\" The kindly smile returned to the old man's face. \"After your meal, you are free to leave, sir. I will not restrict your freedom.\"\n\n\"It just ends like this?\" Zhou Ze found it somewhat absurd.\n\n\"Yes, it has ended,\" the old man affirmed.\n\n\"But I remember you said that Prefect… he wanted a bad person, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is indeed the case.\"\n\n\"Just because the identity card is damaged, I get an exception?\"\n\n*Really? Just because of good luck?*\n\n\"No. The will of the Prefect cannot be compromised in the slightest.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"The answer lies within your own heart,\" the old man prompted.\n\n\"I really hate that Zen-like wordplay monks use,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old man reached out and patted his own chest. \"Sir, on that point, I feel the same way.\"\n\nZhou Ze's expression suddenly darkened as if he'd realized something. He immediately looked down, lifted the bib from his neck, and exposed the left side of his chest.\n\nIt was empty there.\n\n\"I have applied the finest ointment to the wound for you. It will heal in a few days without leaving the slightest scar. I even took the liberty of treating the other wounds on your body.\n\nYou needn't thank me, nor do you need to be so polite.\"\n\n*I'll thank you, my ass!*\n\n\"Where's my heart? Where's my heart!\" Zhou Ze demanded.\n\nThe old man pointed to the plate in front of Zhou Ze and said amiably:\n\n\"You said it tasted good.\"\n\n*Clang!*\n\nZhou Ze slammed his knife and fork onto the table.\n\nThe old man picked up a cup of tea, rinsed his mouth, spat it out, and then slowly stood up.\n\n\"Without a heart, you won't have so many worries. You will be able to live a more comfortable life.\n\nA good man, without his conscience, can't be all that good anymore, can he?\"\n\nZhou Ze gripped the tablecloth tightly with both hands and looked up at the old man.\n\n\"You had better kill me right now.\"\n\nThe old man smiled faintly. \"So, sir, are you going to say it again now: 'Do not bully the young for being poor'?\"¹\n\nAfterward, the old man lightly patted his chest, drew in a sharp breath, and feigned awe:\n\n\"Truly, terrifying to behold.\"²\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze was speechless.\n\n\"Sir, you will have no chance to take revenge on me. My lifespan reached its end long ago. When you leave this room, I will dissipate from this world.\"\n\n\"Will you go to hell?\"\n\n\"There is no place for me in Hell,\" the old man replied. \"This is the final end.\"\n\nThen, the old man pointed again to the plate in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Sir, would you like me to wrap that up for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up. There was an empty feeling in his chest, and the gaping hole where the wound was looked horrifying, yet he wasn't dead. To be precise, Xu Le's body hadn't died. He didn't even feel the slightest bit of pain.\n\n*The wound will heal in a few days?*\n\nPicking up the ID card from the table, Zhou Ze walked toward the door, but stopped midway and asked:\n\n\"I'm very curious. Who exactly was that Prefect?\"\n\n\"Ever since the Prefect was deceived by that Bodhisattva who ran off to Hell, he has been unwilling to speak his own name.\"\n\nHe didn't get an answer, but Zhou Ze had no desire to linger here any longer. Pushing open the door before him, he walked out. When he turned back, he found the door he had just exited was gone.\n\nBehind him was a field of desolate graves.\n\n…………\n\nInside the house, the old man quietly cleared the dishes and cleaned the room once more.\n\nAfterward, he laid his hand flat and patted the table.\n\n\"Come out.\"\n\nA small golden snub-nosed monkey scurried out from some corner, leaping onto the table. It scratched its ears and cheeks at the old man, looking quite adorable.\n\nHowever, the monkey's body was somewhat ethereal, clearly not a real entity.\n\n\"Although it is said that every injustice has its perpetrator and every debt its debtor, what you did this time went too far. Even if the final consequence was borne by that infant, it should not have been the target of your revenge.\n\nEverything pursues cause and effect, and submits to cause and effect. If everyone acted according to this principle, you little beast, why would you even need to pursue the Great Dao?\n\nEating, drinking, being born, growing old, getting sick, and dying—isn't that the truest adherence to cause and effect?\"\n\nThe golden snub-nosed monkey shook its head, then nodded.\n\n\"Don't blame me for pulling the soul you attached to that infant over here. Your 180 years of merit will be compensation for that child. Even though he is disabled, he will be able to live a smooth and successful life, and may even become a normal person after surgery in the future.\n\nYou shouldn't feel you got a bad deal. Let this matter end here. In a moment, I will give you a new physical body. You may leave on your own. Whether you choose to cultivate anew or simply frolic in the mountains and forests, you must not repeat what you did today.\n\nEven humans who cultivate the Dao face the five maladies and three deficiencies, let alone a little beast like you. Just consider this a tribulation on your path of cultivation.\"\n\nWith that said,\n\nthe old man pushed open the door to the inner room.\n\nThere was no other furniture in this small room, only an ink wash painting hanging on the wall.\n\nIn the painting,\n\nthere was a majestic mountain.\n\n*Creation's beauty all converges here, dividing yin and yang, the dusk and dawn!*³\n\nA man wearing a purple crown and a yellow robe stood atop the mountain peak.\n\nThe painting was already yellowed with age,\n\nthe man in the painting long gone.\n\nOnly the majestic mountain in the painting still stood there, with a view that made all other mountains small.\n\n\"Prefect, your old slave has completed the task you assigned.\"\n\nThe old man knelt and prostrated himself before the scroll.\n\nThe scene of their parting long ago resurfaced in his mind:\n\n…………\n\n\"You old codger, die a little later, hold on for a while longer, and help me keep an eye on who this identity card ends up with. If it's a good person, slaughter him for me and find a new one!\n\nI put my faith in the bullshit of those monks, believing their nonsense about 'so long as Hell is not empty, I will not become a Buddha.' My entire life's reputation was ruined!\n\nThe one who holds my identity card must absolutely not be a good person again, otherwise, I will not be able to rest in peace!\"\n\n\"Master, what is a good person, and what is a bad person?\n\nA good person might do bad things, and a bad person might do good things.\n\nAs for the distinction between good and bad, this old slave is foolish. I fear I may fail the Prefect's instructions.\"\n\n\"Goddammit, where's the need for all that convoluted, roundabout crap! If you think he's not a bad person, just kill him.\"\n\n\"Yes, your old slave will obey the decree.\"\n\n…………\n\n\"Was he a good person?\"\n\nIn the inner room, the kneeling old man slowly raised his head, murmuring at the scroll:\n\n\"He was indeed a 'good' person.\n\nBut in my eyes,\n\nhe was a 'bad' person.\"\n\nAs the old man spoke, his face began to darken. Yellow fur started to grow on his face and hands.\n\nHis features twisted and contorted, becoming a hairy face with a thunder god's beak-like mouth!\n\nThis was an old ape!\n\nBorn in the wilds of Mount Tai, his life's ambition was to hoist that very mountain.\n\nIn ancient times, he was called: a Mountain-Moving Ape!\n\n\"My young descendant cultivated for 180 years, was happy to help others, and was diligent in his practice. Yet he met such a great calamity, suffered such a bitter injustice!\n\nRelying on his human standpoint, he acted without any regard for the circumstances and struck it down!\n\nOn what grounds!\n\nOn what grounds!\n\nJust because he is human, because he was human in his past life!\n\nSo, any non-human creature that poses a threat to humans, regardless of right or wrong, regardless of the truth,\n\ndeserves to be killed? Deserves to die?\"\n\nThe old man sat down cross-legged.\n\nHe murmured one last time:\n\n\"From a human's standpoint, he is a good person.\n\nFrom this old slave's standpoint as a member of the monkey clan, he is a bad person.\n\nHehe,\n\nin the end,\n\nthis very fact prevented him from being killed.\n\nPrefect,\n\nwas this your intention?\n\nPrefect,\n\nthis old slave is coming to follow you. After so many years without this old slave by your side to cook for you, you must not have been used to it, right?\"\n\nThe life force left the old man.\n\nThe ape's body just sat there.\n\nThe soul-state golden snub-nosed monkey then ran out, first kneeling and kowtowing to the old man's remains, before burrowing into the old man's husk.\n\nA moment later,\n\nfrom beneath the old man's clothes,\n\na tiny monkey, only about the size of a palm, crawled out.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak...\"\n\nThe little monkey chittered a few times, then ran out.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  \"Do not bully the young for being poor\" (莫欺少年窮) is a famous line from the popular Chinese web novel *Battle Through the Heavens*. It implies a young, down-on-his-luck protagonist will eventually become powerful and get revenge. The old man is mocking Zhou Ze for sounding like a cliché hero.\n2.  \"Terrifying to behold\" (恐怖如斯) is another phrase popularized by web novels, often used to describe someone's immense power in a dramatic, sometimes overwrought, fashion. The old man's use is sarcastic and theatrical.\n3.  These two lines, and the line \"a view that made all other mountains small,\" are from the famous Tang dynasty poem \"Gazing at the Sacred Peak\" (望岳) by Du Fu, describing Mount Tai.",

    "content": "By the time he got back to the bookstore by taxi, it was already midnight. The bookstore's door was still open, and there were quite a few people inside.\n\nZhou Ze remembered Xu Qinglang had called him earlier to say that business was good tonight. It seemed that was indeed the case; even at this hour, there were still customers.\n\nPushing open the glass door, what disappointed Zhou Ze somewhat was that the dozen or so people sitting in the store were all living people.\n\nLast time with Chief Zhao was a special case. This time, it couldn't be that over a dozen people were all special cases, could it?\n\nEven during the time of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the public morals—oh, no, the *ghostly* morals—weren't this wholesome.\n\nThey were sitting in a circle with a person standing in the middle, telling a story. Everyone else was listening intently. It seemed to be a suspenseful horror story; the storyteller even used cadence and some body language, doing his best to build the atmosphere.\n\nBai Yingying was sitting behind the counter, playing on her phone.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze returned, Bai Yingying proactively stood up and poured him a glass of water.\n\nZhou Ze sat down and subconsciously reached up to cover his chest. Although it was hidden by his clothes, from the looks of it right now, that area was empty.\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong with you?\" Bai Yingying asked, a little puzzled.\n\n\"Hm?\" Zhou Ze looked at Bai Yingying.\n\n\"I just feel like something's different about you. You weren't like this when you left this afternoon.\"\n\nIt had to be said, the female corpse was quite perceptive.\n\n\"It's nothing.\" Zhou Ze didn't feel like talking right now.\n\n\"Since you're back, can I go next door to play games?\" Bai Yingying pleaded.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"The boss is the best.\"\n\nBai Yingying went to the noodle shop next door. Soon after, Xu Qinglang walked out of the noodle shop and into the bookstore. Coming up to the counter, he handed Zhou Ze a cigarette and asked:\n\n\"What's this, a tea party?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn't know.\n\n\"Hey, sounds like they're telling ghost stories.\" Xu Qinglang's interest was piqued, and he actually found a plastic stool and sat down with them.\n\nThe person in the middle of the circle was telling a story about a vengeful ghost infant. It was full of suspenseful twists, and the storytelling was indeed quite good. The people around were also listening with rapt attention.\n\nGradually, Zhou Ze began to understand. This must be a \"club,\" an organization similar to a book club or a cycling club, brought together by a shared hobby.\n\nAfter the last story finished, the man leading the group took out a large sheet of white paper with something drawn on it, and then pulled out several pens.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit far away and couldn't see clearly. Xu Qinglang, however, turned his head and mouthed a word to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Pen Fairy.\"¹\n\nThe Pen Fairy is a type of spirit-summoning game with a very mysterious reputation. It's said that playing this game can easily lead to misfortune and attract spirits to possess you.\n\nThe people were all very excited. Everyone stretched out their hands to hold the long pen together. A man in a yellow woolen coat, who seemed to be the leader, waited until everyone was ready, then began to chant piously:\n\n\"Pen Fairy, Pen Fairy, where are you? Pen Fairy, Pen Fairy, where are you.\"\n\nThe pen still didn't move, but the bookstore suddenly fell silent.\n\nThe man in the black-framed glasses continued:\n\n\"Pen Fairy, Pen Fairy, will we meet a ghost tonight?\"\n\nTen seconds after he spoke, the long pen held by the group began to move slowly.\n\nEveryone held their breath.\n\nIn reality, when many people hold a single pen together, as long as the tip is smooth enough, it's very easy for it to start sliding on its own. If one person were to give it a slight nudge, it would be even simpler.\n\n*Swish!*\n\nThe tip of the pen suddenly jerked,\n\npointing directly towards where Zhou Ze was sitting.\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth fell slightly open. Dumb luck?\n\nZhou Ze remained seated steadily behind the counter, watching the situation with half-lidded eyes.\n\nBecause of the pen's movement, most of the group's gazes were fixed in Zhou Ze's direction.\n\n\"Yes!\" the man in the black-framed glasses said, pointing at the area where the pen tip was.\n\nThere were two areas, \"Yes\" and \"No,\" and the pen tip was currently right in the \"Yes\" zone.\n\n\"Alright, pack it up. We'll head out together in a bit. Remember, the activity lasts for half an hour. Has everyone charged their phones? Later, everyone must record video for at least twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\nThe rest of the group packed their things and left the bookstore. The man in the black-framed glasses, however, walked up to Zhou Ze's counter and said apologetically:\n\n\"Sorry about that, boss. We're from the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association. We go on paranormal explorations when we have free time. We didn't scare you, did we?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You're pretty brave, boss. When that young lady was here earlier, I asked if we could play the Pen Fairy game here, and she approved. I was actually worried you'd be upset with us when you came back. This is for the use of the space. Please, take it, boss.\"\n\nThe man handed over six hundred yuan.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and asked, \"Where are you guys going next?\"\n\n\"The building right above your shop. Haven't all the businesses here been gone for a while? There was even an arson case a while back, a few people burned to death. We plan to try our luck there tonight.\"\n\n\"You want to see a ghost that badly?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but people are always curious about the unknown, right? Really, we all just gathered together for the thrill of it. In our usual social circles, it's hard to find people with similar interests. Our club provides a chance for us to connect. Besides, I've already made arrangements for tonight. During the day, I had someone set things up in the cinema that was burned down. Tonight, Mr. Chen from our club is going to confess his feelings to Miss Liu.\"\n\n\"A confession?\"\n\n\"That's right. Actually, the rest of us all know what's happening tonight; only Miss Liu is in the dark. Our club has been around for five years, and we're all on good terms, so everyone is happy to help.\"\n\n\"Are you Japanese?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at the man in the black-framed glasses.\n\n\"Yes, I'm an overseas Chinese who lived in Japan. I returned to the country five years ago. These kinds of hobby clubs are very common in Japan. After coming back, I found that everyone here is too introverted, so I'm usually the one who organizes activities like our regular book clubs or ghost-hunting expeditions.\"\n\nThe man slapped his forehead and handed over his business card.\n\n\"My Chinese name is Cui Yilang. It's a pleasure to meet you.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the business card from his hand.\n\n\"Well, we'll go get our activity started then. Thanks again for your hospitality, boss.\"\n\nCui Yilang walked out of the bookstore. Xu Qinglang, who had been standing on the side without saying a word, immediately clutched his stomach and burst out laughing.\n\n\"Hahaha, I was holding that in so hard I almost died! They're really going to see a ghost this time.\"\n\nAs Xu Qinglang laughed, he noticed Zhou Ze wasn't laughing. He reached out and gave Zhou Ze a light punch on the chest, asking, \"Isn't it funny?\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately bent over, one hand clutching the spot on his chest that had just been hit.\n\n\"Hey... are you okay? I didn't even use much force.\"\n\nI was just playfully tapping your chest.²\n\n\"'It's not that.\" Zhou Ze held up a hand, signaling Xu Qinglang to stay back, while saying, \"I was just laughing so hard my heart hurts.\"\n\n\"That dramatic?\" Xu Qinglang pursed his lips. \"Are you hungry? I can go make you a... bowl of egg fried rice?\"\n\n\"Not hungry. I already ate.\"\n\n\"You ate out?\" Xu Qinglang asked, a bit curious. \"Don't you usually find it hard to stomach food from outside?\"\n\n\"That thing... was delicious.\"\n\n\"What kind of dish was it? If you can eat it, I'll go buy some tomorrow and cook it for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"A person only has one heart.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't exactly produce a whole basket of them for Xu Qinglang to \"pan-fry, deep-fry, boil, or steam.\"\n\n\"So, what have you been craving lately?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Water spinach,³ I guess.\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang and said very seriously, \"I've suddenly been craving that recently.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll go stock up tomorrow.\"\n\nJust then, the lights in the bookstore suddenly went out.\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! It's the final circle, the zone's on me!!!! This queen was about to get her chicken dinner!⁴ My Groza, level three gear, a 15x scope!\"\n\nBai Yingying rushed out of the noodle shop and stood outside, wailing at the top of her lungs.\n\nZhou Ze felt that even when she was drowned in a pig cage back in the day, she probably hadn't screamed this intensely.\n\nThe power was out.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang also walked outside.\n\nXu Qinglang made a call, then put the phone down and said helplessly:\n\n\"Son of a bitch. They said someone won't come to fix it until tomorrow. Old Zhou, this area is really going to the dogs. The power goes out and they can't even be bothered to come check on it right away. It's become a ghost-hunting spot for hobbyists now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed up towards the windows of the tall building above them. \"What were they thinking, proposing in a cinema where people have died?\"\n\n\"It's very romantic. The terrifying atmosphere, combined with the suddenness of love—for people who are into that sort of thing, that kind of contrast is intoxicating.\"\n\n\"Why do you sound so strange today?\" Xu Qinglang glanced at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You really look like you've been hollowed out. Did you... take that step with your wife today?\" Xu Qinglang asked cautiously.\n\n\"You're overthinking it.\"\n\nBut the phrase \"hollowed out\" made Zhou Ze's eyelid twitch slightly, a detail that Xu Qinglang caught.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head and looked up.\n\n\"Hey,\n\nstaring at the sky won't help.\n\nAre you feeling guilty?\n\nDid I actually guess right?\"\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze didn't answer, Xu Qinglang also raised his head,\n\nand looked at the sky.\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe two of them saw what looked like a person in white clothes standing by a glass window on the fifth floor.\n\nBecause of the power outage, there was no light around, but the moon was very bright tonight, and the color of the person's clothes was easy to make out in the darkness.\n\n\"Don't tell me they also hired someone to pretend to be a ghost to enhance the atmosphere?\" Xu Qinglang blew out a smoke ring. \"They're really taking this to the extre—\"\n\nXu Qinglang stopped talking,\n\nbecause he saw the white figure from above begin to fall,\n\nat a high speed,\n\nlanding directly less than ten meters away from him and Zhou Ze.\n\n*Thud!*\n\nA heavy, muffled sound echoed.\n\nA person had landed face-up on the ground. She wasn't moving. Blood began to slowly spread out from underneath her body.\n\nZhou Ze felt something cold on his face.\n\nA few specks of blood had splattered onto his cheek.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately ran over to check on the fallen person.\n\nBut Zhou Ze reached into his pocket, took out a napkin, and prepared to wipe the bloodstains from his face first.\n\n*Someone's dead... I have to save them... I have to check the situation...*\n\nA look of struggle appeared in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nBut his hand still trembled as it pulled out the tissue,\n\nslowly and meticulously wiping away the few drops of blood.\n\n\"Hey, get over here and see if there's any chance of saving her!\" Xu Qinglang shouted, looking up at Zhou Ze. Then, when he saw Zhou Ze standing there without moving a single step, just wiping his face, he roared:\n\n\"Do you have a conscience?! How can you just stand there wiping your face at a time like this!\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment.\n\nRight.\n\nThe heart...\n\nit's gone...\n\n***\n\n¹ The Pen Fairy (笔仙, *Bǐxiān*) is a spirit-summoning game similar to a Ouija board, popular in China.\n\n² A reference to a popular, slightly coquettish internet meme phrase (人家用小拳拳捶你胸口) meaning a playful tap.\n\n³ Water spinach in Chinese is 空心菜 (*kōngxīncài*), which literally translates to \"hollow-hearted vegetable.\"\n\n⁴ \"Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner,\" the victory phrase from the game *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* (PUBG).",

    "content": "\"Alright, the statement is complete. You may go.\"\n\nA young police officer closed his notepad and gave Zhou Ze a slight smile.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, stood up, and prepared to leave.\n\nJust then, the middle-aged officer who had been sitting next to the young policeman during the interview suddenly spoke up:\n\n\"Mr. Zhou, your bookstore is located over there, isn't it? How's business?\"¹\n\n\"Not so great,\" Zhou Ze answered honestly.\n\nMany people had asked him this question. They were asking about business with the living, so naturally, Zhou Ze answered in terms of business with the living.\n\n\"Then why do you choose to keep the shop open there?\" the middle-aged officer asked.\n\n\"I'm a live-in son-in-law. My wife's family is very rich, so I'm not short on cash. It's just something to pass the time.\"\n\nThe middle-aged officer was taken aback for a moment, then nodded. He gestured with his hand and said, \"You may leave. We'll contact you if we need to consult with you about anything else.\"\n\n\"I'd be delighted.\"\n\nZhou Ze left the interrogation room.\n\nThe young officer twirled the pen in his hand. \"Captain Sun, that guy is pretty interesting.\"\n\nYes, to so directly admit to marrying into a wealthy family, to frankly state that he was just coasting and living off his wife, really did take a lot of guts.\n\n\"Go check on the other interrogations.\" The middle-aged officer stood up and glanced once more at Zhou Ze's departing back. He just felt that the young man who had been sitting before him had made him feel as if there were thorns at his back.\n\nDuring an interrogation, a police officer should be the cobra, and the person being questioned, the prey. The snake must strike with maximum speed, precision, and ruthlessness to break through the other's defenses and uncover the truth.\n\nBut just now, he'd had the strange feeling that in the other's eyes, he, the cobra, was nothing more than a dancing spectacle in an Indian street performer's wicker basket, swaying to the sound of a flute.\n\nThe man, it seemed, couldn't care less.\n\n…………\n\n\"You're out?\" Xu Qinglang had also just finished his statement and came out. \"So unlucky. Had to make a trip to the police station in the middle of the night to give a statement.\n\nAlso, that young cop was so annoying. He asked my gender three times. Is there something wrong with his brain? Can't he tell what my gender is?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang.\n\n*Don't you have a goddamn clue what you look like?* he thought to himself.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were both shop owners, and they had witnessed the fall firsthand, so they needed to give a statement, but that was basically it. The other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association, however, were being treated as key suspects by the police, which was to be expected.\n\n\"By the way, who do you think the murderer is?\" Xu Qinglang asked, smoking a cigarette.\n\nThe sun was about to rise; it was already morning.\n\n\"That's not our problem. The police will investigate and solve the case,\" Zhou Ze said very calmly.\n\n\"Hey, don't be so negative, alright?\n\nDidn't you ever read Sherlock Holmes or watch Detective Conan when you were a kid?\"\n\nEveryone, deep down, has a bit of a detective dream, a detective fantasy.\n\nThe thrill of peeling back layers of fog to find the truth, and then, like the magician Liu Qian, theatrically spreading your hands and cryptically announcing, \"And now, it's time to witness a miracle!\"\n\nThat would definitely hit a lot of people's G-spot.\n\n\"I'm not interested in people.\"\n\n\"Still set on messing with ghosts,\" Xu Qinglang said sarcastically.\n\n\"That's right. Messing with ghosts.\" Zhou Ze took out his phone to call a ride. At the same time, he said, \"Do you remember what color clothes the female victim was wearing when she jumped?\"\n\n\"White.\"\n\n\"And after she landed?\"\n\n\"Red, of course.\" Xu Qinglang shrugged. \"I guess it was stained red by the blood. Ah, so pitiful.\"\n\n\"The dress she was wearing when she landed was red to begin with,\" Zhou Ze reminded him. \"Don't fool yourself with that cliché about it being stained by blood.\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded silently, then reached up to touch the tip of his nose. \"You mean, there's some secret behind this? It's not just a simple accident or murder?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I really hope that's the reason. The ghosts I've run into before were considered formidable if they could give someone a cold. If I can actually find one that can cause an accident and kill someone, that would be a huge score.\"\n\nA ghost like that must be worth dozens of others, right?\n\nThe work achievement for sending it to Hell must also count for ten, or even more, right?\n\n\"Aren't you overthinking this? Oh, speaking of which, I forgot. I didn't tell the police that her clothes were white at first.\" Xu Qinglang clapped his hands. \"Maybe the key to solving the case lies in the color change of the clothes! The killer must have designed some incredibly clever...\"\n\n\"Are you possessed by Agatha Christie or Conan Doyle?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No.\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze mournfully. \"Old Zhou, I'm finding you less and less fun. You used to at least play along a little.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the mood.\"\n\n\"So are we just going back now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Back to catch ghosts?\"\n\n\"To play with a planchette.\"²\n\n\"Why are you so childish?\"\n\n\"Ever heard of... entrapment?\"\n\n………………\n\nThe bookstore hadn't been sealed off, but there was a lot of police tape around the perimeter, and quite a few officers were milling about, searching for clues.\n\nAs a result, the already quiet bookstore, with its lack of living customers, seemed even more silent.\n\nZhou Ze had Bai Yingying buy a planchette divination kit. She just searched for sellers in Tongcheng on Taobao, then took a taxi to pick it up directly.\n\nA sheet of paper was spread out.\n\nA large pile of questionably useful paraphernalia was placed to one side.\n\nXu Qinglang squatted nearby, watching Zhou Ze bustle about. He said with some resignation, \"Actually, I have a few methods for summoning spirits that I think would work better than this game.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"It's not the same.\"\n\n\"What's not the same?\"\n\n\"Last night, I didn't sense anything coming.\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. \"Did you?\"\n\n\"Did something come over last night?\"\n\nAn image surfaced in Xu Qinglang's mind: the group playing with the planchette, the long pen sliding toward Zhou Ze.\n\n\"That was probably just a coincidence. Didn't that overseas Chinese guy say their activity last night was just a setup for a love confession? So, someone probably deliberately pushed it towards the spot behind you, meaning that building. It wasn't actually pointing at you.\"\n\n\"A very good analysis.\" Zhou Ze reached out, lifted the paper on the floor, and then ran his fingernail over the ceramic tile. \"Was this also deliberate?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes widened instantly.\n\nOn the ceramic tile floor was a groove, less than half a meter long, that you probably wouldn't even notice if you were standing.\n\nZhou Ze picked up a pen, placed its tip in the groove, and let it slide along the path. He and Xu Qinglang slowly turned to follow its direction.\n\nThen,\n\nThe spot the pen pointed to,\n\nWas Bai Yingying, who was sitting behind the counter playing *Honor of Kings*. That was where Zhou Ze had been sitting last night.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the pen aside and looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\nCarving a small groove into a ceramic tile was no easy feat.\n\nXu Qinglang looked incredulous. \"No way. Did something really get summoned last night? How come neither of us saw it?\"\n\n\"The last time Chief Zhao came, did we realize he was already dead?\n\nThe last time the Faceless Woman came in disguise, did we see through to her true identity?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\nZhou Ze silently unfolded the paper again and picked up the pen. \"Do you think, with my identity, I won't be able to summon the planchette spirit?\"\n\nStrictly speaking, Zhou Ze was a ghost emissary. He was different from the members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association last night.\n\n\"I don't know, but what I want to know is, did you already sense something was wrong last night when you were sitting there watching the show?\" Xu Qinglang asked, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Although I didn't feel any particular fluctuations, and I didn't see anything I shouldn't have, when they pushed that pen in my direction, my heart lurched, as if something had its eyes on me.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you warn them beforehand!\"\n\nXu Qinglang grabbed Zhou Ze by the collar.\n\n\"You felt something was wrong, something that could even make *you* lurch!\n\nWhen they said they were going to that building behind us to play their damned exploration game or confession game, why didn't you stop them or warn them!\"\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand, not to push away Xu Qinglang's grip, but to wipe away the spittle that had sprayed on his face when Xu Qinglang shouted. Then, he looked at Xu Qinglang:\n\n\"What does it have to do with me?\"\n\nYes,\n\nWhat does it have to do with me?\n\nReleasing Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang stumbled back two steps. He suddenly felt that the man before him was a stranger.\n\n\"They were customers in my shop. According to business regulations, I naturally have an obligation to ensure their safety while they are reading books or having a tea party in my shop.\n\nBut since they had already left my shop, what happened next, what does it have to do with me?\"\n\n\"You weren't like this before,\" Xu Qinglang murmured.\n\n\"What we need to do now is not to get sentimental about the past, nor to lament that things have changed, but to find that hidden thing and send it to Hell.\"\n\n\"You're keen on this?\"\n\n\"It's a work achievement. Weren't you always mocking me for not having a goal in life?\"\n\n\"You...\" Xu Qinglang licked his lips. \"Fine, you go ahead and investigate. I'm not playing along anymore.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand dismissively and stormed out of the bookstore.\n\nAt that moment, Bai Yingying walked out carrying tea, looking somewhat surprised.\n\n\"Boss, did you have a fight with Beauty Xu?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't reply. He silently squatted down, continuing to stare at the groove, at the planchette chart before him.\n\n\"Well, I'm going back to my game then, Boss.\" Bai Yingying placed the tea next to Zhou Ze, stuck out her tongue, and ran next door.\n\nShe didn't notice that Zhou Ze, squatting on the floor and looking at the planchette chart, had beads of sweat constantly forming on his forehead, while one hand was clutching tightly at the left side of his chest.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*I have to find that thing as soon as possible,*\n\n*Otherwise, more people will die,*\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*Why does it hurt so much!*\n\nWhen Bai Yingying entered the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang was sitting there, smoking. Seeing her come in, Xu Qinglang said directly:\n\n\"Has something been wrong with your boss these last couple of days?\"\n\n\"I actually think he's become more normal,\" Bai Yingying said, sitting down and turning on the computer.\n\n\"More normal?\" Xu Qinglang chuckled twice. \"You didn't see someone fall to their death in front of us yesterday, and he just stood there wiping his face with a tissue!\"\n\n\"The person died on impact, right? Could he have been saved if he hadn't wiped his face?\"\n\nBai Yingying entered her game with a dismissive air. \"He was an experienced doctor in his past life. He can tell with one glance if someone can be saved. Rather than running over and shouting and making a useless scene, he might as well wipe his face clean first.\"\n\n\"Hey, you're taking his side? Are you two even human?!\"\n\n\"Actually, neither of us is.\"\n\n*Click!*\n\nJust then,\n\nThe computer screen flashed and then went black.\n\nThe power had gone out again.\n\n*Smack smack smack smack smack!*\n\nBai Yingying pounded on her keyboard. \"Goddammit, I just got a 98K on the drop!\"³\n\nXu Qinglang, who had been sitting there smoking, immediately ran out of the shop.\n\nHe looked up,\n\nToward the sky.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nBy the window on the fifth floor,\n\nStood a man dressed in white.\n\nMany of the surrounding police officers were frantically making calls and shouting into their walkie-talkies for their colleagues in the building to stop him, while a middle-aged police captain roared:\n\n\"How did someone get up to the crime scene? What the hell are you all paid for?\"\n\n*SPLAT!*\n\nA dull and familiar sound of impact.\n\nXu Qinglang stood frozen on the spot,\n\nStaring blankly as the person fell from the sky.\n\nEverything,\n\nWas just like the night before.\n\nHe instinctively closed his eyes.\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nHuman lives were like dumplings being dropped into a pot,⁴\n\nOne after another,\n\nWorthless.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

    "content": "Hearing the clamor of the crowd outside,\n\nZhou Ze, who had been squatting there, slumped dejectedly to the ground. The tiled floor was a bit cold, but what was even colder was his heart.\n\nOh,\n\nright.\n\nHe'd forgotten he didn't have a heart anymore.\n\nLifting his shirt, Zhou Ze found that the place where he had been hollowed out had already recovered. It had completely healed in just one night.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze wonder if he had fallen for the other party's illusion—if, in fact, his heart was still there.\n\nBecause he could feel a heartbeat. His body was still full of vitality, with no apparent problems.\n\nBut it seemed some kind of emotion had been stripped away.\n\nSome of his instinctive reactions had also been stamped with a prohibition symbol, as if an invisible wall had trapped him.\n\nThe him of last night should have rushed to the deceased's side just like Xu Qinglang, even if his first instinct told him the person was definitely dead. The old him would have reacted that way.\n\nLike just now, when Xu Qinglang berated him, he had retorted, \"What does that have to do with me?\"\n\nIn truth, given his state last night—first fighting that monkey, then being dragged to the dinner table by that baffling old man for a one-of-a-kind meal—he was already somewhat dazed.\n\nEven when that group was playing with the Ouija pen, and he had sensed something, he couldn't have possibly had a clear reaction.\n\nThe him of last night was already like a bird startled by a bowstring, paranoid and seeing danger in every shadow; any so-called \"stirring\" felt ambiguous.\n\nOf course, these were all excuses. Zhou Ze now clearly felt as if he were getting braces. You can still eat, you can still drink water, but you're always under some restriction, and it just feels uncomfortable.\n\nThat's just how people are. No matter how great the misfortune and pressure you encounter, as long as there is hope before you, you can always clutch it tightly and keep moving forward.\n\nThe Zhou Ze in the orphanage was like this, the Zhou Ze in the hospital was like this,\n\nand even the him of now was like this.\n\nTo put it nicely, it's called resilience. To put it bluntly, it's 'better to live a miserable life than to die a good death.'\n\nHe braced his hands on the ground,\n\nraised his head,\n\nand let out a long breath.\n\nHe hadn't been in time.\n\nHe had kept telling himself that he had to find that thing early, then capture it, throw it into Hell, and earn merit. This was definitely a lucrative piece of merit.\n\nBut hadn't he also known full well that as long as that thing wasn't found, if one person died, a second and third would surely follow?\n\nOnce a ghost truly kills, it only becomes more and more frenzied. For a ghost, to suddenly repent is to vanish into thin air.\n\nAnd because of this, people would continue to inexplicably end their own lives in this manner.\n\nBut Zhou Ze couldn't let himself think that way, couldn't let it become a source of anxiety, or the twisting pain in his chest would become unbearable.\n\nJust as that old man had said at the dinner table: \"Once a person loses their conscience, there's a limit to how good they can be.\"\n\nJust then, his gaze drifted dazedly upward. He saw what looked like a faint black line on the ceiling.\n\nSuddenly,\n\na shudder ran through Zhou Ze's body.\n\nHe'd found it.\n\nHe'd found that thing.\n\nIt had never come inside. It wasn't in the bookstore last night.\n\nIt was above.\n\nIts gaze was looking down,\n\nwatching everything here!\n\nIt even extended its hand, influencing the tip of the pen, and in this way, bit by bit, joined the game.\n\nThis was an inconceivable method, a method that transcended Zhou Ze's understanding.\n\n\"Finally, no more people have to die!\"\n\n\"*Hiss…* It hurts so much…\"\n\nZhou Ze, who had just stood up, had no choice but to bend over and squat down again.\n\n\"Now I can finally make my merit.\"\n\nThere, it doesn't hurt anymore.\n\nFuck!\n\n***\n\n\"The deceased is Chen Yinong,\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze, who had just walked out, while chewing on a betel nut.\n\n\"The guy who was going to confess his love last night?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yeah, him. I was just listening in on the police. He'd probably just finished giving his statement. Who knew that as soon as he left the station, he'd show up here and jump.\"\n\nThe police hadn't identified a specific suspect, so after Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang gave their statements, the others were also allowed to leave after the investigation. The only restriction was that they were not allowed to leave Tongcheng for the time being.\n\n\"So he came back from the police station just to die for love?\" Zhou Ze remarked with a sigh. \"What a terrifying wedding.\"\n\n\"Hey, can't you show some decency? The man is dead,\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Decency? Do you need to accumulate virtue? I've got some hell money over at my place. You can go burn some if you need to.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"Who the hell invented the idiotic method of accumulating virtue by burning hell money? You think burning hell money can solve all your problems and earn you virtue?\"\n\n\"That sounds like saying money is the root of all evil. Then why don't you sell your twenty-something properties and donate it all to Project Hope¹?\"\n\n\"...\" went Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Come with me to a place,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the tall building to the west. \"There.\"\n\n***\n\nThere were several high-rises in this commercial center, all connected by walkways. Of course, with the desertion of the commercial center, the businesses in these high-rises had long since moved out.\n\nThis was one of the signs of excessive urban development. When the construction of high-rises outpaces the daily needs of the people, you often end up with these massive 'ghost buildings,' which are also a waste of resources.\n\nThe elevators were out of service, so Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang could only take the stairs.\n\n\"Hey, the two people who jumped were on the other side,\" Xu Qinglang reminded him. \"They were on the other side, directly above your shop and mine. What are you doing over here?\"\n\nTheir current location was to the west of Zhou Ze's and Xu Qinglang's shops, nearly a hundred meters away from where the successive suicides had occurred.\n\n\"You're a mystic yourself. So what makes you, an insider, also mistakenly believe that a ghost needs to kill like a human, by standing in front of someone and stabbing them with a knife?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Then on what basis did you determine that thing would be here?\"\n\n\"The grooves in the tiles.\"\n\nThe two had already reached the fourth floor. Zhou Ze chose a spot that offered the shortest, most direct line of sight to his shop, then extended his index finger and swiped it gently through the air.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"If you're just going to be a curious little baby asking 'why' next to me, I suggest you go act in a suspense drama. Because there's always a need for some idiot assistant to stand next to the protagonist, constantly asking 'why,' setting the stage for him to show off.\"\n\n\"Damn, you're getting more and more acerbic,\" Xu Qinglang said, displeased.\n\n\"Because I've always treated you like a brother, not a woman.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder.\n\n\"You're not exactly gentle with Bai Yingying either.\"\n\nZhou Ze made another swiping motion with his index finger, then said, \"Actually, this should be a parallel line. Can you understand?\"\n\n\"You mean when that group was playing with the Ouija pen last night, they really did summon something, but that thing didn't get close? Instead, it was standing roughly where we are now.\n\nAnd then, with its finger, it controlled the movement of the pen tip, pointing it at you?\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Zhou Ze said, a slight smile on his lips. \"So, that one is very bold. Last night, the members of that enthusiast association asked if they would successfully see a ghost tonight, and the pen tip was manipulated to point at me.\n\nIt didn't mind offending me. It didn't even mind killing someone right next to me.\"\n\n\"That brazen?\"\n\n\"No, in my eyes, this means it's more valuable, and the merit gained from sending it in will be more significant. This is a big fish, a big fish that doesn't even give a damn about a Hell Emissary.\"\n\n\"Then isn't it very dangerous?\" Xu Qinglang muttered.\n\n\"That's why I called you along.\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. \"I told you I see you as a brother. So if the opponent is terrifying, we'll die together. Isn't that romantic?\"\n\n\"...\" went Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Romantic my ass, you damn pervert!\"\n\n\"It's fine. Worst case, we go to Hell. I've been there, I know the way.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured again, then took out his phone to look at the photo of the line, continuing to calculate the angle in his head. Then he pointed to the roof and said, \"It's on the fifth floor. Shouldn't be too far off.\"\n\n\"Hey, you could have at least told me earlier so I could bring some talismans!\" Xu Qinglang complained as he ran up the stairs after Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Remember the night we captured Bai Yingying? It wouldn't have made much of a difference whether you had talismans or not.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was momentarily speechless, then cursed, \"You heartless bastard.\"\n\nZhou Ze's steps faltered for a moment, and he smiled.\n\nThen,\n\nthe two of them walked to the easternmost window on the fifth floor.\n\nThis place was supposed to have been an amusement park, but it was now covered in dust. Some machinery and facilities that hadn't been moved were still there, giving off an extremely desolate atmosphere.\n\nXu Qinglang was a little nervous, but Zhou Ze continued to walk forward at a leisurely pace.\n\nIt should be right in this spot.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze stopped in front of an inflatable toy castle.\n\n\"Well now, long time no see!\"\n\nA familiar voice came from behind the inflatable castle.\n\nZhou Ze looked up,\n\nand saw an old man in a filthy, stained Taoist robe jump down from it.\n\n\"Big brother, long time no see! I've really missed you! Come, come, we'll drink tonight. My treat, to repay you for last time!\"\n\nThe old Taoist walked over to greet Zhou Ze.\n\nBut just then,\n\nXu Qinglang instinctively formed a hand seal:\n\n\"Boundless Heaven and Earth, Mystic Heart's True Law!\"\n\nHe bit his own index finger and pressed it against the center of the old Taoist's brow.\n\nHis movements were fast, without a hint of hesitation.\n\nBut the next scene shocked Xu Qinglang. The old Taoist, as if nothing had happened, glanced at Xu Qinglang twice and grumbled:\n\n\"Is there something wrong with this missus of yours? Or is this a custom in your family, to greet people by smearing blood on their face? Damn, this is way cooler than the Dai Water-Splashing Festival!\n\nCome, come, let this poor Taoist teach you about the customs from my hometown.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old Taoist reached down and scratched his crotch, as if to return the favor to Xu Qinglang.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze shot his hand out, his fingernails instantly growing long, and clamped it directly around the old Taoist's neck.\n\nAnd in the hand that the old Taoist had just used to rummage in his pants, a bright yellow paper talisman had appeared out of nowhere. He looked at Zhou Ze with a stunned expression:\n\n\"Dammit... you're... faster... than me...\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over the paper talisman, and then his nails tightened. The old Taoist's entire body convulsed as if electrocuted. Finally, with a light push from Zhou Ze, the old Taoist fell to the ground and rolled several times.\n\nIgnoring the old Taoist who had fallen unconscious on the ground, Zhou Ze leaped directly over the inflatable castle.\n\nBehind the inflatable castle,\n\nlay a person,\n\ncovered in wounds.\n\nFound him.\n\nHe really was here.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Project Hope**: A real-world Chinese public service project aimed at financing schools in impoverished rural areas.",

    "content": "Here is the woman, a white dress draped over her, but the body beneath it was a mass of scars. It seemed every part of her bore a different kind of wound, a shocking sight to behold.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's professional perspective, the fact that this woman wasn't dead yet was truly a miracle.\n\nIn your typical shoot-'em-up movie, the tragic character who's been shot multiple times can still summon their last ounce of strength for a long and tedious flashback, followed by a back-and-forth shouting match of \"Go, you have to go!\", \"I won't go!\", \"If you don't go, I won't go either!\", before finally hoisting a gun to mow down a few more enemies. In reality, that's basically impossible.\n\nHumans are, in fact, very fragile.\n\nThe reason the woman before him wasn't dead yet, still breathing, her chest still rising and falling faintly, had to do with her own unique nature.\n\nZhou Ze walked straight over, then pressed his fingernail into his palm, preparing to open the Gate of Hell.\n\n\"So direct?\" Xu Qinglang asked from behind. \"Not even going to ask her anything?\"\n\n\"There's nothing to ask.\"\n\nWhile she was still unconscious, he would snatch her soul from her body and send it to Hell. Everything would be perfect.\n\nHowever, just then, the old Taoist priest whom Zhou Ze had thrown aside struggled back to his feet and charged at Zhou Ze again.\n\nXu Qinglang took a step forward, raising a hand to block the old Taoist, then flung him to the side. The old priest had just been \"zapped\" a few times by Zhou Ze's nails and was still weak, so naturally, he was no match for Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Don't... don't do this. Spare her, I'm begging you, spare her.\"\n\nLying on his side, the old Taoist priest began to plead.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was unmoved. A thread resembling black syrup was drawn out, forming a circle.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze reached out, intending to pull her soul from her body. Although the soul was currently very weak, Zhou Ze could already sense the formidable level of its essence.\n\nThis was a big fish, a much more succulent prize than the small fry he'd caught before!\n\n*Buzz!*\n\nAt that moment, a fountain pen suddenly floated up and shot directly toward Zhou Ze.\n\nWith quick reflexes, Zhou Ze leaned back slightly, dodging the pen. But the pen's true target wasn't Zhou Ze, but Xu Qinglang. Its tip pressed against Xu Qinglang's throat.\n\nAlthough Xu Qinglang's Adam's apple wasn't very prominent, he now stood with his hands spread wide, not daring to move a muscle.\n\nThe woman on the floor still had her eyes closed. She was still unconscious, but she was the one controlling all of this.\n\n\"Old Zhou, don't be rash, don't be rash!\"\n\nXu Qinglang yelled, terrified that Zhou Ze would disregard his life. He was, at this very moment, hanging by a thread—no different from having someone press a pistol to his temple.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze truly did disregard his life, his fingers reaching for the woman's forehead.\n\nAt the same instant, the tip of the pen pierced Xu Qinglang's neck, creating a small cut from which fresh blood began to flow.\n\n\"Urgh...\" Xu Qinglang felt the pain spreading from his neck but didn't dare reach for the pen. He had a premonition that if he made the slightest rash move, the pen would instantly pierce through his neck.\n\nThe woman didn't wake, but for Zhou Ze, this was a silent threat.\n\nShe couldn't do anything to Zhou Ze, but she could threaten him with the lives of those around him.\n\n\"Those two people who jumped to their deaths were very pitiful,\" Zhou Ze said suddenly.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned. He had no idea why Zhou Ze would suddenly bring that up.\n\n\"You were scolding me this morning for not warning them last night. Said I'd changed,\" Zhou Ze continued.\n\n\"Huh?\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"So, I figure you must be willing to sacrifice yourself to avenge them, right?\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze clutched his chest with one hand and pressed his other hand to the ground. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead, and he ceased all other movements.\n\nThe fountain pen fell to the ground with a clatter. Xu Qinglang clutched the small wound on his neck, gasping for air, his mouth muttering what sounded like curses, though the words were unclear.\n\nThe old Taoist priest hurriedly scrambled to the woman's side to check on her condition, looking both anxious and lost.\n\nZhou Ze shot a resentful glare at Xu Qinglang. If he had known, he wouldn't have brought him along. He had only thought that an extra person could help him find his target faster; who would have guessed that Xu Qinglang would become leverage for the other side to threaten him with?\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze should have ignored Xu Qinglang's life and death to meet his quota, but he had forcibly changed his mind. And just like that, a stabbing pain lanced through his chest, torturing him to death's door.\n\nDammit,\n\nThis is a transaction, okay?\n\nHow is this being 'conscientious'?\n\nAnd this hurts *me*?\n\nBesides, if he dies, who's going to make my sour plum juice?\n\nI was just thinking of myself!\n\nThe old Taoist priest fumbled in his crotch again and pulled out a talisman paper. This guy's supply of talismans was truly inexhaustible, and he had a peculiar habit of hiding them in that specific spot. Who knew if there was some special significance to it.\n\n\"Brother, I'm sorry, but I have to protect this person. She barely managed to escape from Chengdu; I can't let her fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest said to Zhou Ze, holding the talisman. He finished with an apologetic tone:\n\n\"My apologies.\"\n\nWith that, the old Taoist priest was about to slap the talisman onto Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's head snapped up, a black glint flashing in his eyes. However, before Zhou Ze could make a move, two figures appeared directly behind the old priest.\n\nXu Qinglang was still clutching his neck, but the syllables leaving his mouth were becoming clearer.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was lifted off the ground. He twisted his head only to find that a man and a woman had appeared behind him at some point—two empty human skins, yet possessing a strength no less than that of an ordinary person.\n\n*Bang!*\n\n\"Damn it all!\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest was thrown once more, crashing onto the tiled floor.\n\nWriggling his body, one hand clutching his back, the old priest cried out in a mournful tone:\n\n\"Oh, my back...\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly calmed the stabbing pain in his chest and raised his hand again. He knew that the woman before him was extremely weak; her earlier resistance and the standoff were the absolute limit of what she could do.\n\n\"Brother, I'm beggin' you, spare her. Let us go.\"\n\n\"Let you go?\" Xu Qinglang clutched his neck with one hand, while the other manipulated the two puppet skins to slowly approach the old Taoist. \"Then who's going to answer for the two people who jumped to their deaths?\"\n\n\"We didn't kill 'em two. We didn't touch 'em. We were tryin' to save 'em! They wanted to die themselves!\" the old Taoist explained.\n\n\"You think we'd believe that?\" Xu Qinglang snorted.\n\nSeeing Xu Qinglang acting as if he were possessed by a \"Champion of Justice,\" the old Taoist priest ignored him and turned his gaze back to Zhou Ze, pleading:\n\n\"Brother, she's one of us from the Underworld Store, a friend of my boss. She got hurt trying to help my boss.\"\n\nThe old Taoist remembered that when he first met Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze had been very interested in matters concerning his boss. At this moment, all he could do was try to use his boss's name.\n\nZhou Ze's hand had just rested on the woman's forehead. Before he could exert any force, he heard the old Taoist's words and immediately paused.\n\nA companion of that man?\n\nThe man from the old Taoist's livestream video, sitting behind the counter of the Underworld Store, struggling to drink congee?\n\nThe man who had appeared by the pool in his dream to warn him about the faceless woman's scheme?\n\nHe owed that man a favor.\n\n\"Hsssss...\"\n\nHis chest began to hurt again.\n\nZhou Ze took several deep breaths, then took two steps back, staggering to his feet.\n\nFortunately, the pain didn't last long, but every time he made a choice that violated his principle of \"profit above all,\" every time he let himself be swayed by personal connections, it would remind him.\n\nIt was like a venomous scorpion was hidden in his chest.\n\nThere's a famous experiment involving monkeys, a cage, and electric shocks.\n\nPerhaps this was the price and purpose of having no conscience: to create a conditioned reflex, to slowly break you of your old \"bad\" habits.\n\n\"You don't actually believe him, do you?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze waved a hand dismissively.\n\n\"Hey, no one is stupid enough to jump off a building to their death one after another. Didn't you say before...\"\n\n\"I trust that guy,\" Zhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang, then looked at the old Taoist. \"You can take her away. Just don't appear in front of me again.\"\n\nA man's reputation precedes him. Zhou Ze no longer believed this woman was responsible for the deaths of the couple who jumped from the building on consecutive days. This woman may have participated in the Pen Spirit game and might have even intervened, but she definitely wasn't killing people.\n\nThe little loli had once said that the man from Chengdu had played with fire, styling himself as a judge, operating outside the laws of the mortal world to carry out his own so-called righteous judgments, which was why he had incurred the wrath of the Underworld.\n\nTherefore, a friend of a person like that couldn't possibly be a malevolent spirit who killed indiscriminately. Otherwise, given that guy's personality, he would have been the first to kill this woman.\n\nThis line of reasoning was truly more believable than any so-called evidence. Even when the little loli spoke of that man, she only mocked him for his arrogance, but she never said a single thing against his private character.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately clutched his back and stood up, thanking Zhou Ze profusely. But when he reached the woman's side, his face fell again.\n\n\"Brother, we have nowhere to go. She told me to bring her here, thinkin' we could hide right under the lamp,¹ so those people chasin' her wouldn't notice this place. If I take her away now, wouldn't it be like a lamb to the slaughter?\"\n\n\"You're... wanted?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uh, that's about the gist of it. Anyway, those guys are unpredictable. They can pop up anywhere—in mirrors, in crowds, even from the bushes or from underground. It was pure luck we managed to escape all the way here alive.\"\n\n\"It's pointless anyway. Her injuries have worsened severely. She doesn't have much longer,\" Zhou Ze said, rubbing his fingers together. \"Once this physical body is destroyed and she's left as a pure soul, she'll either be discovered quickly, or she'll fall directly into Hell.\"\n\n\"We tried goin' to a hospital to treat her injuries, but as soon as we entered the room, a doctor who looked perfectly normal suddenly stripped off his clothes and turned into a hideous thing tryin' to kill us.\"\n\nThe old Taoist looked extremely troubled.\n\n\"It's only these past two days, stayin' near you, that we've had a bit of peace.\"\n\n\"My hands are tied,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nHis admiration for the man from Chengdu was just that—admiration. He had repaid the favor he owed by turning a blind eye this one time. He wasn't willing to get himself tangled in any more trouble. Otherwise, the next time it would be the little loli leading a troop of spectral emissaries to storm his bookstore.\n\nAt this moment, the fountain pen that had fallen to the ground suddenly stood up on its own. Xu Qinglang's expression changed, and he grew vigilant.\n\nBut the pen simply wrote a few words on the floor:\n\n\"Save me, and I'll give you my heart.\"\n\nSeeing these words, Zhou Ze's gaze immediately hardened.\n\n\"Shameless little hussy!\n\n\"How confident is this woman in her looks? She'll give her heart to whoever saves her?\"\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed from the side. \"No matter how beautiful you were before, looking like this now, what kind of an idiot would want your heart!\"\n\n\"I would.\"\n\n\"What?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned, staring at Zhou Ze. It was as if, in that moment, Xu Qinglang was seeing Zhou Ze for the first time. Dr. Lin was so beautiful, yet he could pass by her door three times without a glance.² It turned out his tastes were... like this.\n\n\"Brother, didn't you just say there was nothing you could do?\" the old Taoist asked, perplexed.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. I just remembered. In my past life, I was the best surgeon in Tongcheng.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Hiding right under the lamp:** An idiom (燈下黑, *dēng xià hēi*) meaning the safest place is often right under the enemy's nose, the last place they'd look.\n2.  **Pass by her door three times without a glance:** An allusion to the legend of Yu the Great, who was so dedicated to fighting floods for his people that he passed his own home three times without entering.

    "content": "\"Hey, Zhou Ze, you've changed. Are you even human anymore? You were the one who said she killed those two people, and now you're the one who wants to save her! One minute you're having me go with you to catch the killer, the next you're having me help you carry the killer back.\n\nWhat in the world do you take me for!\"\n\nBack in the bookstore, Xu Qinglang muttered this while pointing directly at Zhou Ze's back.\n\nNo, to be precise, Xu Qinglang hadn't stopped his verbal barrage for the entire trip down from the building, chattering incessantly like he was lecturing a deadbeat husband who'd been messing around for nights on end, not coming home, and withholding household money.\n\nBai Yingying sat behind the counter, playing on her phone. She didn't dare turn on the computer to play games anymore; the intermittent power outages were truly unbearable.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't intended to acknowledge Xu Qinglang—he didn't have the energy for it right now—but Xu Qinglang seemed to be getting addicted to running his mouth. Zhou Ze spun around, pointed a finger at the other man's nose, and said directly:\n\n\"What do I take you for? Have you never heard the saying, 'No investigation, no right to speak'?\n\nI don't know her, but I know her friend. I owe that person a favor. So let me ask you, is that reason enough?\"\n\n\"But the two people who died...\"\n\n\"Do I know those two dead people?\" Zhou Ze retorted. \"What do they have to do with me? Am I Joan of Arc? Or Hai Rui?¹ Have I asked the locals to build me a temple and burn incense for my meritorious deeds?\n\nI'm just an unlucky ghost, killed by a hitman hired by an idiot, and then by some twist of fate, I possessed that idiot's body!\n\nI'm not human, I'm a ghost. So please, Boss Xu, with your twenty-something properties, stop trying to hold me to your set of universal values!\n\nYou want me to be selfless? You want me to pursue truth and justice?\n\nThen you should have shouted 'Fire at me!'² when you had that pen at your throat!\n\nYou can't even do it yourself, yet you have the nerve to criticize others?\n\nI'm a ghost. For a long time, I didn't even have a legal identity. Under those circumstances, you still expect me to be 'one for all,' but when has 'all' ever been for me?\"\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"You what? Didn't you bend the rules yourself? Forcibly keeping your parents' spirits behind just to enjoy some 'family reunion' atmosphere?\n\nWhen you were doing that, why didn't you stop to think about all the other bereaved families in the world who don't get that kind of privilege?\n\nI don't care if she killed anyone or not. I owe that person in Rongcheng a favor, and that's enough for me to turn a blind eye!\n\nI don't care if she's the killer or not. She promised to find my heart for me, so I'm willing to treat her!\n\nIt's. That. Simple!\n\nSo please, take your arrogance, take your self-righteousness, take your holier-than-thou attitude, and kindly get the hell over to the shop next door!\"\n\nHaving said all that in one breath, Zhou Ze let out a long sigh. To be honest, he'd been really on edge lately, especially after the incident with Monkey. Really, truly on edge.\n\nHe shouldn't have stuck his nose in other people's business. He could have just covered his eyes and pretended he saw nothing. That way, he wouldn't have had to make any choices, and he wouldn't have had his heart taken by that old cabbage stalk.\n\nHe could have been like an ostrich, burying his head in the sand, sticking his butt in the air, and wiggling it around,\n\nwhile shouting, \"What a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful world this is!\"\n\nWouldn't that be nice?\n\nWouldn't that be comfortable?\n\nXu Qinglang gulped, rendered somewhat helpless by Zhou Ze's verbal counterattack.\n\nThe scene, for a moment, turned cold.\n\nBai Yingying had been watching from the side for a while, not daring to interrupt.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, his spirit utterly crushed—truly, like a begonia battered by a fierce storm, utterly disheveled. Then, with a flick of his sleeve, he turned and walked toward the entrance. But he paused as he pushed open the glass door and asked:\n\n\"What do you want for lunch?\"\n\n\"Tomato and beef over rice with a strawberry juice, thank you,\" Zhou Ze answered without hesitation.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nXu Qinglang left to go make lunch.\n\nBai Yingying stuck out her tongue, then covered her nose.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her. \"If you're about to say you smell something sour again, it means the toilet is clogged again. Go scrub it three more times.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately shook her head. \"Smells sweet to me.\"\n\nJust then, a van pulled up in front of the bookstore.\n\n\"Go get the stuff.\"\n\nFollowing Zhou Ze's command, Bai Yingying went out and carried two boxes inside. The van left as soon as the items were unloaded.\n\n\"What's in here?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"Simple surgical instruments.\" Zhou Ze opened one of the boxes and took out a pair of gloves to put on.\n\n\"Boss, how did you get someone to deliver these?\"\n\n\"I was a doctor in my past life.\"\n\n\"Uh, and then?\"\n\n\"And then, of course, I know which department head smuggles medical equipment, takes bribes, and lines his own pockets. A simple phone call to threaten him is all it takes to get him to send over some inexpensive instruments.\"\n\n\"That works too?\" Bai Yingying was stunned, taking a good moment to process what he'd said.\n\n\"Bring the things upstairs,\" Zhou Ze said, then headed upstairs himself.\n\nOn the second floor, the woman lay on the straw mat. The old Taoist squatted beside her with a cigarette dangling from his lips. When Zhou Ze came over, the old Taoist asked worriedly:\n\n\"Big bro, you got this?\"\n\n\"You could always send her to the hospital and let those bailiffs find her.\"\n\nThe old Taoist said no more.\n\nBai Yingying carried the boxes up, one in each hand, as if they were nothing. Sometimes Zhou Ze felt he was getting the short end of the stick; if he ran a construction crew instead of a bookstore, an employee like Bai Yingying would be a goldmine. He could save on excavators and bulldozers and all that.\n\nOnce everything was ready and the instruments were sterilized, Zhou Ze prepared to begin the surgery.\n\n\"Big bro, no anesthesia?\" the old Taoist reminded him from the side.\n\n\"She doesn't need anesthesia. Her willpower is terrifying.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and used scissors to cut open the hastily bandaged wounds the woman had sustained.\n\nThe wounds hadn't been treated poorly, but these were no ordinary injuries; simple bandaging was completely ineffective.\n\n\"That's true. I heard she once went half a year without sleeping and pulled through,\" the old Taoist muttered from the side.\n\nZhou Ze held open a wound on the woman's left arm and prodded inside with a pair of forceps. The woman showed no reaction; she seemed to be in a deep sleep.\n\nNext, Zhou Ze used the forceps to pull a black feather from the wound and dropped it onto the metal tray Bai Yingying was holding.\n\n*Clink...*\n\nThe feather was soft, but it made a crisp sound as it landed.\n\n\"This poor Taoist recalls that this feather should be from a black feather duster. Some pale-faced fellow in black clothes was chasing us with it.\"\n\n\"Black Impermanence?\"³ Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Don't know. Looked a bit like him,\" the old Taoist replied.\n\nZhou Ze gave a noncommittal grunt and continued cleaning the wounds.\n\nGood heavens.\n\nWho knew how many strange things were embedded in this woman's body?\n\nIn the time that followed, Zhou Ze successively removed torn talisman paper, darts carved with runes, and drained out silvery mercury water. It was like opening a sundry shop; there was a bit of everything.\n\nBai Yingying and the old Taoist watched from the side, utterly dazzled.\n\nDuring the procedure, although the foreign objects remaining inside the wounds were cleaned out one by one, for this body, it was tantamount to a second round of trauma. Because of this, Zhou Ze was also constantly monitoring the woman's condition.\n\nFinally, as Zhou Ze removed two shards of red glass from a wound on the woman's lower abdomen, he saw a faint black mist rise from her body, and a shadow looked as if it were about to float out.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze could see this sight.\n\nThis was a sign that the body was on the verge of collapse, unable to hold onto the soul. From a scientific perspective, it meant the patient was about to die, resuscitation efforts failing.\n\nZhou Ze's right fingernails grew long. He directly grabbed the black shadow and forced it back into the body.\n\n\"Nngh...\"\n\nA barely audible sound escaped.\n\n\"Just hold on a little longer. There are a few more wounds to take care of, then we'll apply some medicine. Get through this, and your body can slowly recover.\"\n\nThis was the most unusual surgery Zhou Ze had ever performed in his medical career. Setting aside the complexity of the patient's injuries, the fact that he was treating her while simultaneously pushing her soul back in whenever it tried to leave her body was something that would shock the entire medical world if it got out.\n\nThis was basically cheating, like having infinite coins in an arcade game to keep continuing.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze also knew this was only possible because the woman's soul was exceptionally strong to begin with. An ordinary person's soul might endure it once, but a second or third time would probably cause it to shatter completely.\n\nFrom this perspective, this woman's tenacity was truly terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze even grew a little curious. If a woman at his side was this resilient and formidable, what was the man himself—the one stirring up storms in Rongcheng—actually like?\n\nBirds of a feather flock together, after all.\n\nAfter treating the last wound and applying medicine, Zhou Ze let out a long sigh.\n\nNow, it was up to her own willpower to hold on until her body slowly recovered. The problem shouldn't be too big.\n\nIn fact, if that old geezer who had dug out his heart were still around, getting some medicine from him would have been the best option. The wound on Zhou Ze's own chest had already healed without leaving so much as a scar.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze sometimes wondered: did the man really cut open his chest and dig out his heart?\n\nOr had he simply been under some kind of illusion? But then where did that pain come from every time he thought of doing something that went against his own self-interest?\n\nThe woman was settled upstairs. The old Taoist went to the restaurant next door to eat, while Bai Yingying ran off to play games, leaving only Zhou Ze to monitor the woman's condition.\n\nAbout a few hours later, as Zhou Ze was sitting to the side reading a book, he suddenly noticed the woman's eyelids twitch. Then he saw her open her eyes.\n\nThe woman was looking at him.\n\nHe was also looking at the woman.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman nodded slightly, indicating that her body was recovering.\n\n\"Heh, what's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman was silent for a long time. Just as Zhou Ze was beginning to wonder if her physical condition prevented her from speaking, the woman opened her mouth:\n\n\"Tang... Shi...\"\n\n\"My name is...\" Zhou Ze paused, then asked with some curiosity:\n\n\"Whenever you introduce yourself, do you often get some joker replying that his name is Song Ci?\"⁴\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Hai Rui:** A famously incorruptible and just official from the Ming Dynasty, often seen as a symbol of integrity and justice in Chinese culture.\n2.  **\"Fire at me!\":** A famous line from the classic Chinese war film *Heroic Sons and Daughters*, spoken by a soldier telling his comrades to fire on his position to take out the enemy, even if it means sacrificing himself.

    "content": "Three more days passed by, neither hurried nor slow.\n\nIn these three days, Xu Qinglang was busy looking for a new shop. This long-neglected commercial center had already seen two deaths; setting up shop here again would be just asking for trouble. He had asked for Zhou Ze's opinion, wondering if he would be willing to move with him. He could even help Zhou Ze find a new storefront at the same time. Zhou Ze's response to this was noncommittal.\n\nOn the one hand, Zhou Ze didn't really care about the presence of living people around his bookstore. But on the other hand, without the sauces Xu Qinglang concocted, eating would become a problem again.\n\nSomething else happened in those three days: the police found suicide notes in both Mr. Chen and Miss Liu's homes, along with their wedding photos.\n\nHowever, the wedding photos were in black and white, and the contents of the suicide notes were even more difficult for an ordinary person to comprehend.\n\nThey had made a pact to die for love, to end their own lives in a terrifying manner. In their notes, they apologized for the trouble and investigation they had caused for the other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association, and simultaneously stated that this was a true horror story.\n\nThey had met through their love of \"horror,\" so naturally, they had to prove their love in the most \"horrifying\" way possible.\n\nThis news also spread online, causing a public uproar and once again stirring up discussion. Many influencers once again brandished their leather whips, criticizing horror and mystery films and novels. See? This is how you corrupt the youth. This stuff should be banned.\n\nBut in reality, what ought to be banned are ancient love stories like *The Butterfly Lovers*,¹ because these stories extol the theme of dying for love, leading countless later generations to emulate them.\n\nThe woman named Tang Shi had remained on the second floor. After her injuries were treated, she had waited for three days. Zhou Ze finally came before her. He had done what he promised; now it was her turn to fulfill her end of the deal.\n\n\"Those two people… it really was suicide, wasn't it?\"\n\nTang Shi was still lying there, wrapped in so many bandages she looked like a female mummy. There was simply no way to worry about aesthetics; her original injuries were just too severe and too numerous.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"I sensed it when they were playing the pen spirit game,\" Tang Shi said, her eyes on Zhou Ze. \"I thought it was quite amusing at the time. They wanted to see a ghost, but they never realized that the owner of the very bookstore they were in was a ghost, and a Hell Emissary at that.\n\n\"In fact, the first night when that woman was preparing to jump, I tried to use my white dress to stop her, but her mind was made up. I was too weak and couldn't stop her. She still jumped.\"\n\nZhou Ze said nothing.\n\n\"Ignorant men and women always think death is a beautiful thing, but they're probably in Hell right now, regretting everything. Hell is a terrifying place, enough to make most who commit suicide curse their past foolish selves.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Tang Shi paused, then continued, \"You're much luckier than us. You've never experienced the true horror of Hell.\"\n\n\"It's time to get to the point,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Your heart, is it?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"Do you believe your heart is gone?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"But it can't be gone. There are many mind-boggling things in this world, but on the whole, there's still a line that keeps things in balance.\n\n\"For example, the injuries on my body. You saw them. Those emissaries who escaped from the Underworld, the things they left on me were also things like black feathers, mercury water, and paper talismans. Their image in the eyes of ordinary people is very mysterious and grand.\n\n\"But in reality, just as a goddess must eventually use the toilet, if you peel away the mysterious veil of them being able to enter and exit Hell, they are actually very ordinary.\n\n\"So much so that they are far from having the kind of powers to move mountains and fill seas, like the characters described in superhero movies or cultivation and fantasy novels.\n\n\"Of course, I'm not saying no one has that kind of power, but I am certain that any existence with such power cannot leave Hell.\"\n\n\"So, what exactly are you trying to say?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"About you losing your heart. You told me you can't eat, right? Just like us. I've watched you these past few days, forcing food down with extremely sweet and sour drinks.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"But you said that when you ate your own heart, you didn't feel the slightest discomfort. You even found it a little… delicious.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that what I ate wasn't actually my heart? No, that I wasn't eating anything tangible at all.\"\n\nZhou Ze quickly understood and continued, \"The meal, the dining table, the knife and fork… it was all fake. It was all an illusion.\"\n\nTang Shi gave a slight nod. She seemed a bit tired but still spoke.\n\n\"No matter how mysterious or terrifying an existence is, they don't have the power to make flesh grow on withered bones. It's even more impossible for them to possess the miraculous ability to dig out a person's heart while keeping their physical body as alive as it was before.\n\n\"Therefore, you must have been hypnotized. A very profound form of hypnosis, one that you yourself can't escape from.\"\n\n\"Hypnosis?\"\n\n\"Yes, hypnosis. The dining environment, every word the other person said, every gesture, they were all giving you psychological suggestions. Otherwise, why didn't he just pick up some firewood by the roadside and have a barbecue with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. In many ways, what Tang Shi said coincided with his own previous speculations.\n\nFor instance, every time he made a choice that went against his current self-interest, his chest would ache. But if he just endured it for a moment, he could still follow through with his original choice.\n\nBecause he subconsciously believed he no longer had a conscience, whenever he did something originating from a place of \"conscience,\" he would always remind himself: *Oh, this is something I shouldn't be doing, so now it has to hurt.*\n\nIt was the same principle as someone who, after experiencing childhood hardship that left psychological trauma, would still feel physical and mental discomfort upon seeing similar events or scenes.\n\n\"So I should find a psychiatrist?\"\n\n\"I know a very powerful psychiatrist. He can help you solve your problem,\" Tang Shi said.\n\n\"That one?\" Zhou Ze naturally thought of who she meant.\n\n\"As long as he makes it back alive, he can solve your problem.\"\n\n\"Who knows where he's run off to now?\"\n\n\"He didn't run,\" Tang Shi corrected. \"He went to find them.\"\n\nThe conversation ended there. As Zhou Ze prepared to go downstairs, Tang Shi spoke again.\n\n\"Could you ask that female jiangshi to come up?\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"To sleep with me.\"\n\n\"I'll go ask if she's willing.\"\n\nDownstairs, Bai Yingying was sitting behind the counter, playing a game on her phone. Zhou Ze ignored her, not bothering to ask on the woman's behalf. He walked straight out of the store and hailed a taxi.\n\nA psychiatrist. He really did know an excellent one.\n\nLast time, Wang Ke had told him that he wouldn't seek Zhou Ze out again, but if Zhou Ze ever needed anything, he could come find him.\n\nTurns out he was right.\n\nIt was already eleven in the morning when the taxi arrived at the gate of Wang Ke's villa. Zhou Ze rang the doorbell.\n\nThe door opened, and Wang Ke appeared, dressed in a set of pajamas. Seeing it was Zhou Ze, he first looked surprised, then motioned for him to come in.\n\nA rich, meaty aroma wafted from inside the house. Something was stewing in the kitchen.\n\n\"Want to eat together?\" Wang Ke suggested. \"I just bought some large bones, they've been stewing for a long time. I remember back in the orphanage, it wasn't easy for us to get a meal with meat.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I don't have much of an appetite.\"\n\n\"That's fine, you can have some soup then. By the way, you came to see me, so you must need something, right?\"\n\n\"I was hypnotized. The hypnotist told me I have no conscience. Now, I want to get my conscience back,\" Zhou Ze said, getting straight to the point.\n\nWang Ke frowned, looking a little awkward and uneasy. \"I tried last time, but I couldn't hypnotize you. You said you can't sleep under normal circumstances, so I can't use the most direct and effective method on you. I can only try a more roundabout approach and see if it works.\"\n\n\"Let's try.\"\n\nThe two went to Wang Ke's study.\n\nWang Ke changed into a formal suit and sat down behind his desk, then handed Zhou Ze a pocket watch.\n\n\"You swing this in front of me and try to hypnotize me. Then we can achieve a kind of reverse psychological link.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, Zhou Ze took the pocket watch and began to swing it in front of Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke watched it intently. As he watched, he closed his eyes.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze also felt a little tired, as if Wang Ke's \"sleep\" was affecting him somewhat.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke didn't answer.\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Wang Ke.\"\n\nIt was a novel feeling. Zhou Ze didn't have much experience in this area, but at this moment, it seemed no experience was necessary.\n\n\"You...\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze's vision blurred. Vaguely, he thought he heard a man's voice asking him a question:\n\n\"Do you think you need a conscience?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit dazed but still answered, \"Doing good deeds can lead to bad outcomes.\"\n\n\"So, deep down, you actually resent the way you've always behaved,\" the man's voice came again.\n\nWhat followed was a long conversation. Zhou Ze himself was in a bit of a stupor, as if the dialogue and questions had nothing to do with him.\n\nIn front of him, there was a pot. A soup was simmering in it, with large bones boiling inside. The aroma was rich.\n\n*Clatter!*\n\nThe pocket watch fell from Zhou Ze's hand onto the floor.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes.\n\nBehind the desk, Wang Ke also opened his eyes. They were bloodshot, and he looked utterly exhausted.\n\n\"Was it successful?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke nodded, then shook his head, saying apologetically, \"Your problem is a bit complex. Actually, the one who is truly conflicted about whether or not to have a conscience is you. It's possible that some recent events have shaken your original beliefs, and with an external push, it formed a psychological block.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze nodded, lost in thought.\n\n\"By the way, did you ask me any questions?\" Wang Ke suddenly asked.\n\nThis type of hypnosis was inherently mutual. In fact, Wang Ke had only performed a superficial hypnosis on Zhou Ze, while Wang Ke had completely bared his soul to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I didn't ask. All I saw was a pot of meat soup. Are you very hungry?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm hungry,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\nImmediately, Wang Ke pulled Zhou Ze to the kitchen and opened the pressure cooker. Inside, pork ribs were stewing.\n\n\"Come on, eat a little with me. Think of it as reliving our childhood.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a sense of unreality.\n\nAn immensely wealthy psychiatric expert, joyfully stewing a pot of pork ribs for himself at home. There was something about the scene that just felt wrong.\n\nZhou Ze even felt a tinge of nausea rising in his chest.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously took a few steps back, out of the kitchen.\n\nWang Ke, however, was focused on preparing the dipping sauce. \"Come on, eat a little with your big brother.\"\n\n\"You eat it yourself,\" Zhou Ze refused again, his gaze sweeping intermittently toward the pressure cooker and the large ribs tumbling inside.\n\n\"Don't be polite. This is meat I carefully selected. The flavor will definitely be good,\" Wang Ke continued to invite him.\n\n\"Where's your wife?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke's hand, holding the small dish, suddenly trembled. His expression was a little unnatural.\n\nBut he still said, \"She went to get her hair done.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze was noncommittal.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze glanced again at the pressure cooker.\n\nThe nausea and queasiness in his chest seemed to be intensifying.\n\n\"Honey, you're making meat soup again,\" a woman's voice called from the entryway just then.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head. Seeing her, he suddenly felt a great weight lift from his mind.\n\n*I was overthinking things.*\n\n\"Yeah, it's my only hobby,\" Wang Ke said with a cheerful laugh.\n\nThe woman walked over to Zhou Ze's side, looking a bit helpless. \"It's unbelievable, isn't it? A master psychiatrist's hobby is to find some free time to stew a pot of meat soup for himself. Even if he can't eat it all, he still enjoys the sense of satisfaction.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips. \"When you didn't have much as a kid, you fulfill those dreams when you grow up.\"\n\n\"Here, have a bowl.\"\n\nWang Ke ladled out a bowl of soup, sprinkled it with minced garlic and chopped scallions, added two drops of sesame oil, and a pinch of white pepper.\n\nZhou Ze took the soup, hesitating over whether he should force himself to drink some, when he suddenly noticed something.\n\nThe woman standing next to him…\n\nShe was walking on her tiptoes.\n\nOne step, two steps, three steps…\n\nShe walked to the pressure cooker, helped Wang Ke ladle more soup, and at the same time, instructed:\n\n\"Eat up. Don't let it go to waste.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *The Butterfly Lovers* is a famous Chinese legend about a tragic love story that ends in the lovers' joint suicide and their subsequent transformation into a pair of butterflies.",

    "content": "This soup... should I drink it?\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, then set the bowl down. He looked at Wang Ke, and also at Wang Ke's wife.\n\nWang Ke's wife pulled over a chair and sat down, then began rubbing her heel, complaining, \"Honey, my heel still hasn't healed.\"\n\n\"Well, who told you to be so careless? You're lucky you didn't break any bones.\"\n\nWang Ke carefully inspected his wife's heel, then smiled and said, \"You should go back to the room and rest. Don't run around outside so much for a while. It really looks exhausting watching you walk on your tiptoes all the time, and in high heels, no less.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright. I was just trying to make myself look nice for you to appreciate at home.\"\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes at her husband, then gave Zhou Ze a small smile. \"You two chat. I'm heading up.\"\n\nAfter the woman left, Wang Ke pointed at the bowl Zhou Ze had just set down, reminding him, \"The soup's getting cold.\"\n\nZhou Ze, however, took out a cigarette and lit it, making no apologies for smoking in someone else's home as he began to puff away.\n\nAfter a moment, Zhou Ze finally asked, \"What's the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"Just a whim.\" Wang Ke shook his head, then pointed at the pot of meat soup. \"Did you think, just now, that this was a pot of human flesh?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\nWang Ke also took out a cigarette, lit it using the flame from the gas stove, and said, \"This is psychological suggestion. Everyone, in their daily lives, encounters this kind of psychological suggestion to a greater or lesser extent. For example, you've just left your house, and suddenly an auntie nearby tells her child to lock the door after someone leaves, or the house will get robbed.\n\n\"You'll subconsciously wonder if you locked your door, then you'll keep replaying it in your mind and worrying about it, and finally, you'll run back to see with your own eyes whether the door is locked or not.\n\n\"That's a relatively common and simple example. A slightly more advanced one uses repeated suggestive behaviors and ideas to operate from the periphery, thus achieving the effect.\n\n\"For instance, making you believe that I would actually cook a pot of human soup in my own kitchen, and thus not dare to drink it.\"\n\nWang Ke shrugged.\n\n\"Is it absurd? Yes, it's very absurd, but you believed it. That's the most absurd part, and yet, it's the most normal thing in the world.\"\n\nZhou Ze spoke up, asking, \"Is this also part of the treatment?\"\n\nWang Ke shook his head. \"No. This isn't an illness. We psychologists rarely refer to psychological issues as 'illnesses.' This is a knot in your own heart.\n\n\"Just like why you'd think I would cook human flesh. This psychological suggestion has actually been going on for a long time. For example, my wife, who always likes to go out to get her hair done but comes back with her hairstyle virtually unchanged.\n\n\"You think I have a motive to kill her. What's the reason?\n\n\"I've been cuckolded. She found another man outside, putting a cute green hat on me.\"\n\n\"Cute...\"\n\n\"Alright, we can ignore the adjective 'cute' for now. But you can't deny that this was the biggest suggestion that made you mistakenly believe I was cooking my wife's flesh at home.\n\n\"Because you assumed I'd known about it for a long time—and in fact, I have known for a long time. Then you naturally assumed I'd be angry—and alright, I am very angry.\n\n\"After that, you believed I had the motive to kill her and eat her flesh, because I would vent my anger in such a manner.\n\n\"Of course, there were some auxiliary suggestions in there, like my identity, and the fact that my greatest hobby is to cook a huge pot of meat soup at home that I couldn't possibly finish by myself, for the simple reason of making up for the regret of not having enough meat to eat as a poor child in the orphanage.\n\n\"This contrast made it very difficult for you to accept, so your mind naturally began to form its own train of thought, a line of reasoning that you felt made sense.\n\n\"This is what we often call 'the truth' as you see it. Just like many online onlookers, a very simple incident can often be hyped up and fermented by those with ulterior motives, all based on this same principle.\n\n\"Everyone has a Shakespeare and a Sherlock Holmes living inside them.\"\n\nWang Ke picked up a piece of meat with his chopsticks, dipped it in the sauce dish, then put it in his mouth, chewing with his eyes closed.\n\n\"Are you really not going to eat? It's delicious. I remember back in the orphanage, you used to fight with me for meat.\"\n\n\"In the end, you always gave me your chicken leg,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Haha, well you were younger than me, and you called me 'big brother'.\" Wang Ke waved his hand dismissively. \"Back then, I really loved meat too, but I could never get enough.\n\n\"Now that I can afford it, I can stuff myself with meat, but every time I excitedly throw myself into cooking a big pot, I get full after just a few bites.\n\n\"My body isn't what it used to be. I'm not that young lad anymore. Plus, my living conditions have slowly improved since I started working.\n\n\"Now, I actually feel that the most delicious moments were back in the orphanage, watching you eat my share of the chicken leg.\"\n\nWang Ke picked up another piece of meat and put it in his mouth. After eating it, he let out a sigh.\n\nZhou Ze blew out a smoke ring and said nothing, just silently leaning against the kitchen wall, watching the white steam billow and observing the middle-aged man's world-weariness and sighs.\n\n\"Let's talk about your problem. Really, the problem still lies with you. To be honest, wasn't it most comfortable back when you were a doctor?\n\n\"No matter what problems you encountered at work, no matter the scheming, no matter the ostracism and suppression,\n\n\"When a patient was brought before you, healing the sick and saving lives was never wrong.\n\n\"It was consistent with the nature of your job, consistent with the moral ethics of human society.\n\n\"The saying, 'a healer's heart is like a parent's,' allowed you to ignore the patient's identity, their personality, what they had done in the past, whether they were a good person or a bad person, poor or rich.\n\n\"As long as he was brought before you, the only thing you had to do, and must do, was to heal him.\n\n\"But now, you've run into decision paralysis. In some choices, you need to consider many more factors, and you have to gauge the proper measure yourself. This makes you very uncomfortable, and it troubles you deeply.\n\n\"You want to be ruthlessly true to yourself, like a character in a martial arts novel, free and unrestrained, but you can't help but be shackled by the mire of the here and now.\n\n\"Actually, this is the normal state for most people. Aze, you used to be a bit too self-centered. You and I, we both grew up in the orphanage, we both suffered childhood misfortunes, and we both bore the pressure and insecurity of our lack of family during our youth.\n\n\"In fact, both of us have some psychological issues, to a greater or lesser extent. They are seeds, and now they have blossomed and borne fruit in you.\n\n\"You say your conscience is gone, but it's actually there. You are instinctively rejecting it, instinctively disgusted by it, but you can't bring yourself to cut it away.\n\n\"So your subconscious created this scenario. If your conscience is eaten by you, then you can perfectly ignore it.\"\n\n\"How do I solve it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Unless a master psychologist who can completely overwhelm you on a conscious level appears, one who can shatter the shackles in your heart in one fell swoop and make you unable to resist their hypnosis.\n\n\"Otherwise, you can only rely on yourself to slowly wear it down. Either you wear it down, or it wears you down.\"\n\nWang Ke took another sip of soup. It must have been very savory, as a look of satisfaction appeared on his face. \"Big brother here isn't skilled enough. Or rather, I have some methods for ordinary people's psychological problems, but you are not an ordinary person.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"So, I can only let things take their course?\"\n\n\"You don't have to resist it. Instead, you can accept it. Even treat it as a person, as your other side.\" Wang Ke tried to offer his solution. \"What I'm saying is a bit abstract. It's best if you can understand it, but it doesn't matter if you can't. Letting nature take its course is also fine.\"\n\nPutting down his bowl and chopsticks, Wang Ke and Zhou Ze walked into the living room. Wang Ke brewed a fresh pot of tea.\n\nThe local Tongcheng news was playing on the television. Coincidentally, a face that was somewhat familiar to Zhou Ze appeared on the screen. It was an honest-looking face, weeping and roaring.\n\nHowever, the news segment was already more than halfway through; this was the end of it.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze watching the news, Wang Ke explained, \"This matter has been stirred up quite a bit recently. His son has leukemia, and he wanted to find the second daughter he had given away. After mobilizing the media, he finally found her.\n\n\"But the second daughter and her adoptive parents refused to donate. He and his wife went to their home to block them, cursing their daughter for being heartless at the entrance of their residential complex. Then they went to her high school to put up big-character posters, listing her sins to force her to come out and donate.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his tea and took a sip.\n\n\"There are all sorts of strange things these days,\" Wang Ke said with emotion.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Wang Ke and said, \"Actually, they existed in the past too, but there wasn't such a developed information network back then.\"\n\n\"Are you implying something?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Don't look down on your big brother,\" Wang Ke said suddenly, his tone serious.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Everyone has their own difficulties. I don't want this either, but I can see things clearly.\"\n\n\"I'm leaving. Thank you for your diagnosis today.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I've said it before, I won't seek you out again, but you can come to me anytime you need anything.\"\n\nWith Wang Ke seeing him off, Zhou Ze walked out of his house. He glanced back at the second-floor balcony, but the little loli wasn't there.\n\nYes,\n\nThe little loli couldn't possibly be there. She had probably already taken the Faceless Woman and the other Emissaries of Hell to Rongcheng.\n\nHe hailed a taxi and got in. The driver turned his head. \"Buddy, where to?\"\n\n\"Take me to the most haunted place.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt he should take the initiative to go out and find something to do, to rack up some achievements.\n\n\"Yo, are you a writer, brother? Out looking for inspiration?\"\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\n\"Sure thing. I know just the place.\"\n\nThe driver patted his chest, guaranteeing he'd find Zhou Ze a good spot. That place had been really spooky lately; most people didn't dare to pass by there at night.\n\nAnd then,\n\nThe driver dropped Zhou Ze off at the entrance of the \"Midnight Bookstore.\"\n\nThat damned crow appeared again, \"caw, caw, caw\"-ing as it slowly flew by overhead. It seemed to have a knack for showing up at the most opportune moments.\n\nA light breeze blew fallen leaves, which swirled at Zhou Ze's feet with a rustling sound.\n\nZhou Ze glanced back at the taxi, which was already driving away,\n\nand suddenly felt that he should have a talk with Xu Qinglang about moving.\n\n...\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Wang Ke walked in. His wife was lying on the bed, playing on her phone. Seeing her husband come over, she struck a graceful pose.\n\n\"He's gone?\"\n\n\"Yeah, gone.\" Wang Ke smiled and sat down on the edge of the bed. He reached out and stroked his wife's cheek, saying,\n\n\"You've lost weight. You're too thin. You wouldn't taste as good anymore.\"\n\n\"You jerk. You men are all the same. You want your wife to have a good figure to show off when you go out, but you also want her to have some meat on her bones in bed for your comfort.\"\n\n\"I'm getting old. Meat that's too lean gets stuck in my teeth.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nWang Ke used his finger to pick some strands of meat out from between his teeth.\n\n\"Stop dieting.\"",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang's shop was closed for the day. Not completely closed—the rolling shutter was pulled halfway down, and Bai Yingying was sitting inside, playing a game.\n\nZhou Ze had heard that the game called \"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner\"¹ seemed to have a lot of cheats. In that world, cheaters were called \"gods,\" and because cheats were so rampant, the game also had the nickname \"War of the Immortals.\"\n\nBut watching the already-addicted Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze suddenly felt very sorry for the players of this game. Because they probably had no idea that their opponents in this game included not only the cheating \"gods,\" but also a real zombie!\n\nXu Qinglang had probably gone to look for a new shop location. Zhou Ze decided he should look for one too. If he didn't have enough money, he could borrow from Xu Qinglang for the time being. Besides, the girl who gave him her business card last time had also mentioned wanting to invest.\n\nIn short, if he let go of his so-called integrity, money was still easy enough to raise.\n\nHe really couldn't stay in this place any longer. In a little while, it wouldn't just be taxi drivers. Zhou Ze might be sitting in his shop one day and see a tour bus pull up to the door.\n\nA tour guide would lead a bunch of tourists off the bus, holding a megaphone and waving a small flag, and begin their commentary:\n\n\"Esteemed visitors, esteemed visitors, we have arrived at our next scenic spot.\n\nTongcheng has Wolf Mountain, known as one of the Ten Lesser Buddhist Mountains, but Tongcheng also has what's known as one of the country's Top Ten Most Haunted Tourist Destinations—the Midnight Bookstore.\n\nThis place is very dangerous. People often die here for no reason, and people often see the dead reappear here. Everyone, please don't get too close. Taking pictures from the outside as a souvenir is fine.\n\nAbsolutely do not include yourselves in the photos. It's like not taking a picture with the Terracotta Army at the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. Those are funerary objects, things for the dead. Taking a photo with them is bad luck!\"\n\nZhou Ze felt that day might not be far off. The group from the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association who came here to commit suicide had only come because they'd heard rumors about the place. Then, the suicide pact of two of their members added another layer of special atmosphere to this location.\n\nPushing open the bookstore door and walking inside, Zhou Ze saw the Old Daoist dozing in his chair. The Old Daoist hadn't opened his livestream channel in a long time.\n\nJust as you can never be sure if you're playing a game with a cute girl with a big dick² or a zombie, you can also never be sure if everyone watching a livestream is actually alive.\n\nIn fact, among the online viewer counts on major streaming platforms, the number of living people was indeed only a very small fraction.\n\nThe Old Daoist had laid low for a long time. Now, he just stood guard by the woman named Tang Shi. He wasn't glued to her side, but he was still being very responsible.\n\n\"Boss, you're back.\"\n\nZhou Ze's footsteps startled the Old Daoist awake. He wiped the drool from the corner of his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and went straight up to the second floor.\n\nTang Shi still looked like a mummy, but her recovery was going quite well. When Zhou Ze came up, her eyes were open, as if she were staring at the ceiling. At the same time, there was water and a White Rabbit candy next to her.\n\nShe didn't need anyone to wait on her hand and foot; she could manage by herself using a kind of \"telekinesis-like\" ability.\n\nAs Zhou Ze approached, a White Rabbit candy unwrapped itself and flew to his lips. Zhou Ze opened his mouth and took the candy.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze sat down next to Tang Shi.\n\nNeither of them spoke. There was nothing that needed to be said. They sat in silence like this for half an hour before Zhou Ze stood up to go back downstairs.\n\nTang Shi spoke up. \"Did you go see a psychologist?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"It was useless, wasn't it.\"\n\n\"It was somewhat useful,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nHowever, he was still unwilling to eat the meat soup from Wang Ke's house.\n\n\"Mm.\" Tang Shi closed her eyes as if she were tired, but she pressed on, \"Help me call that zombie up here.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and started to walk down.\n\n\"Are you planning to fob me off again?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"You saw through me.\" Zhou Ze wasn't the least bit embarrassed. \"I don't like lending out the pillow I'm used to sleeping on.\"\n\n\"But not being able to rest will have a big impact on my recovery.\"\n\n\"And what does that have to do with me? I've done what I was supposed to do. If you want more from me, you'll have to offer something more of equal value in exchange.\"\n\n\"I can tell you the location of Tongcheng's other Ghost Messenger.\" Tang Shi looked at Zhou Ze. \"Previously, when the Old Daoist was helping me escape, I originally planned to hide at his place. But unfortunately, he seemed to be having some problems, so we ended up coming to you instead.\"\n\n\"That doesn't seem very valuable to me.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"Based on general precedent, Tongcheng is just a small city. One Ghost Messenger should be about right; it's impossible for there to be two. Therefore, the other one must have been replaced. You could go take a look at his place, maybe you can receive some of his inheritance.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained unmoved. \"I'm still not interested.\"\n\nIf it could be received, wouldn't the little loli have done it herself?\n\nZhou Ze certainly didn't believe the little loli was the sentimental type, especially since the matter of that driver she'd scared into a fatal car crash still hadn't been settled.\n\n\"Then I have nothing else to give you.\"\n\n\"Then we'll leave it at that.\"\n\nZhou Ze went downstairs but didn't call for Bai Yingying. Just as he'd said, he would feel uncomfortable giving the pillow he was used to sleeping on to someone else.\n\n\"Boss, what should we have for dinner?\" the Old Daoist asked, pointing next door. \"It looks like the boss next door isn't back yet.\"\n\n\"You figure it out. Do you know how to cook?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then go to his kitchen and find some ingredients to cook with.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze sat down behind the counter.\n\nThe Old Daoist ran next door to cook, and the bookstore fell quiet once more.\n\nBefore long, however, a figure appeared at the bookstore's entrance. It was a girl, wearing a black jacket and a scarf, bundled up tightly.\n\nAlthough Tongcheng had gotten a bit colder recently, it wasn't cold enough to dress like that.\n\nThe girl stared at Zhou Ze through the glass door. Zhou Ze ignored her.\n\nFinally, the girl pushed open the door and came inside. She walked up to Zhou Ze, stopped, removed her scarf, and pleaded, \"Help me.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his teacup, took a sip of water, and still ignored her.\n\n\"Please, help me.\" The girl squatted down in front of Zhou Ze, placing her hands on his thighs. \"As long as you're willing to help me, I'll do anything you ask.\"\n\nAs she spoke, her nimble, fair hands attempted to arouse the man before her.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, grabbed the girl's wrist, and with a slight push, sent her sitting on the floor, looking somewhat dazed.\n\nPutting down his book, Zhou Ze said with some surprise, \"I thought you'd be in jail.\"\n\nYes, Zhou Ze had originally thought this girl would face some repercussions after the matter of her framing her teacher was exposed. But now, it seemed she really hadn't.\n\nAfter a moment's thought, Zhou Ze understood. The girl was a minor, and on top of that, the teacher had committed suicide. Even if she were charged with slander, in the end, they would just smooth things over out of consideration for her being a minor.\n\n\"Did you see the news? My birth parents found me. They want me to save my so-called little brother.\"\n\nAs the girl said this, a vicious glint flashed in her eyes.\n\nShe wasn't a good person to begin with. Even though her middle school teacher had committed suicide because of her false accusation, she continued to live her life happily.\n\nAnd so, when these so-called birth parents suddenly appeared—if they had been rich, with a mansion, a villa, a huge inheritance for her, that would have been fine. But as it turned out, her birth parents were just an ordinary family, which wasn't very interesting.\n\nWhat's more, her birth parents' purpose in finding her was to get her to make a donation to save her little brother.\n\nWhat a joke! Are they out of their minds?\n\n\"You know Lin Ke well, so you should be aware that I'm just a live-in son-in-law. I have no money and no skills, just running this money-losing bookstore. I'm powerless to help.\"\n\n\"I'd like to ask you to pay a visit to my birth parents' home, just like you did at my house last time.\"\n\nThe girl bit her lip. As she said these words, the scene from that night seemed to re-emerge in her mind. She had been terrified, so truly terrified that she hadn't been able to compose herself for several days.\n\n\"Oh, is that all?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, that's all. Just make them stop bothering me, stop pestering me,\" the girl said with certainty.\n\n\"To be honest, when I saw the news before, I thought that second daughter was pitiful, truly pitiful. Those birth parents are real pieces of work.\"\n\n\"Yes, they're jackals, they're animals, they're bastards!\" the girl gritted out.\n\nZhou Ze looked down at the girl still sitting on the floor. \"But when I found out that pitiful girl was actually you, I suddenly felt so good.\"\n\nThe girl was speechless.\n\nBut the girl, after all, had seen her share of storms. She could endure the incredible and unbearable fetishes of old men in bed, which was a testament to her tenacity.\n\nIn fact, she was like a flower blooming amidst a patch of weeds outside a window, constantly experiencing the buffeting of wind and rain, and the repeated moistening of its pistil by the rain and dew. She was indeed much, much tougher than a flower in a greenhouse.\n\n\"I can make you feel even better,\" the girl said, looking at Zhou Ze. \"As long as you help me, just like you did at my house last time.\"\n\n\"Do you think Lin Ke is pretty?\" Zhou Ze asked suddenly.\n\n\"Well... she's very pretty.\"\n\n\"How does she compare to you?\"\n\n\"She's a little prettier than me,\" the girl answered.\n\n\"Then I can tell you, her older sister is even prettier, has more class, and gets to wear a white lab coat uniform. And, she's a... a gentle woman. So, please tell me, on what grounds would I ever be interested in you?\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally wanted to say that Dr. Lin was still a virgin, but he suddenly felt that saying that would be a bit inappropriate, so he changed his words.\n\n\"Help me, or I'll die in your bookstore!\"\n\nA small knife suddenly appeared in the girl's hand, aimed at her own neck.\n\n\"Heh heh, be my guest. I couldn't ask for more. I'm in need of busin—\"\n\n*Pfft!*\n\nThe small knife plunged directly into the girl's neck.\n\nIt was abrupt.\n\nIt was decisive.\n\nIt was even *too* abrupt, and *too* decisive!\n\nFresh blood splattered onto Zhou Ze's face, leaving him stunned.\n\nThe girl's eyes were wide with disbelief as her body slowly fell backward.\n\nZhou Ze shot to his feet and roared at the second floor:\n\n\"What the f--k do you think you're doing!\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **\"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner\"**: The original text uses \"吃鸡\" (chī jī), literally \"eat chicken,\" the common Chinese slang for the game *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)*, derived from its victory message.\n2.  **\"cute girl with a big dick\"**: The original text uses the specific internet slang \"大吊萌妹\" (dà diào méng mèi), which refers to a male player using a cute female avatar, or a trap/femboy. This literal translation preserves the original's crude and specific humor.",

    "content": "\"What the... fuck are you doing!\"\n\nZhou Ze was asking Tang Shi.\n\nIt was obvious.\n\nBefore, when the girl said, \"Ah, if you don't help me, I'll just die and show you!\"\n\nShe was really just saying it, just like how a head teacher always tells their students, \"You're the worst class I've ever taught!\"\n\nIn truth, they say that to every class, so you really can't take it seriously.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't expected her to actually commit suicide. Besides, a woman like her wouldn't kill herself. She cherished herself far too much; how could she possibly commit suicide?\n\nBut just like that, so abruptly—without even a second threat, before she could even manage to squeeze out any tears—she plunged the small knife into her own neck.\n\nHer shocked expression, in particular, made it even clearer that she herself, the person involved, was in a state of utter confusion.\n\n*Who am I?*\n\n*Where am I?*\n\n*My god, I actually killed myself!*\n\nThere was only one possible explanation left. Someone had controlled her knife, making her \"commit suicide.\" And the person capable of doing such a thing was right upstairs.\n\nPerhaps that murderer was even chewing on a White Rabbit creamy candy at this very moment.\n\n\"What's wrong! What's wrong!\"\n\nThe old Taoist, who had been cooking next door, heard Zhou Ze's shout and immediately ran back. Seeing the girl collapsed on the floor, he jumped in fright.\n\n\"Good heavens, young lady, what happened to you!\"\n\nThe old Taoist immediately went over, preparing to administer aid.\n\nZhou Ze, however, went straight upstairs. He saw Tang Shi still lying on the cooling mat.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"Calm down.\" Tang Shi smiled. Her body was still immobile; all she could do for now was talk and smile. \"Now, can you let your maid come up and sleep with me?\"\n\n\"Are you trying to get me killed!\" Zhou Ze demanded.\n\nTang Shi was slightly surprised. \"Shouldn't you be thanking me?\"\n\n\"Thank you, my ass!\" Zhou Ze kicked over the teacup in front of him. The water spilled all over the floor, and the cup flew against the wall, shattering.\n\n\"I don't believe you didn't see through it. Otherwise, why wouldn't you try to save her? You're a doctor; saving people should be your instinct!\n\n\"You didn't perform first aid, but instead came up here to question me. Are you trying to play dumb and go back on your word?\" Tang Shi said in a low voice.\n\n\"It's precisely because I *did* see through it that I couldn't get involved with her! Do you have any idea who gave me the mark on my hand? Do you have any idea whose side that Faceless Woman is on right now!\n\n\"Do you know who led the other Underworld Emissaries to release her, specifically to go to Rongcheng and cause trouble for that person of yours?\n\n\"You think you're so capable, huh? You think you're so smart, huh? You think 'everyone else is drunk, and I alone am sober,' is that it!¹\n\n\"By making a move, didn't you just tell her you're here with me?\"\n\nTang Shi fell silent. She suddenly felt a bit awkward, a bit abashed.\n\nLooked at this way, Zhou Ze had actually seen through it long ago. He was deliberately playing along, and she, thinking she was being clever, had meddled, pushing the situation into an unpredictable abyss.\n\n\"Aiyah, my heavens, don't wrap around me, don't wrap around me! I can't breathe!!!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's shouts came from downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze gave the still-unmoving Tang Shi a deep look and shook his head.\n\n\"Stupid woman.\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze went down the stairs and saw that inside the bookstore, the old Taoist was wrapped in coil after coil of hair, like a big, black zongzi.² The girl who had fallen was nowhere to be seen.\n\nFingernails grew from Zhou Ze's fingers. He walked over and swiped directly at the hair.\n\n*Swish! Swish!*\n\nThe hair snapped at the touch and floated away.\n\nBut the remaining hair on the floor coiled together to form a face, like something out of an ink wash painting. It was very beautiful, very classical, but if you looked closely, you could see that this face had no clearly defined features.\n\n\"Object control. Is that a new ability of yours?\"\n\nA woman's voice echoed from all around the bookstore, empty and hollow, like a chant from the underworld.\n\n\"Or perhaps, have I made a new discovery? A most... unexpected discovery?\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman seemed to be muttering to herself, but in reality, she was posturing—the kind of posturing one does when they've caught their enemy with their hand in the cookie jar.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze had never quite understood why the Faceless Woman hated him so much. Was it merely because he had scratched her with his fingernails in the pools of Hell?\n\nOr did she have some other objective concerning him, like the hysterical, unwilling roar she'd let out as he was leaving Hell?\n\nBut any normal person would be furious at this kind of behavior, being caught off guard out of nowhere.\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze had actually seen it coming, because everything had been too smooth, too natural.\n\nThe clues all led to this girl in a straight line. She had appeared before him in the most appropriate way with the most appropriate excuse, fitting almost seamlessly into his recent life and trajectory.\n\nThere was nothing jarring about it, which in itself was the most jarring thing. She was too much of a perfectionist, too deliberate. With the lesson from last time when she pretended to be Doctor Lin, it would be difficult to fool Zhou Ze so inexplicably again.\n\nOf course, the most important thing was that Zhou Ze didn't believe that girl, after seeing him in that state last time, would dare to appear before him again, dare to strike coquettish poses at him, dare to ask him for help.\n\nLast time, she had actually tried to seduce him, but he had coldly rejected her. Did she think she was Yang Guifei, coming back for another try?\n\nIn fact, thinking back calmly, the Faceless Woman had revealed many flaws when she pretended to be Doctor Lin last time, but Zhou Ze had just learned about Xu Le hiring a hitman to kill him and was in a state of mental turmoil, so she had seized the opportunity.\n\nAll in all, the Faceless Woman was an anomaly formed from the coalesced resentment of countless deceased on the Yellow Springs Road. She was not human.\n\n*How cunning can a beast's tricks be? They only serve to make one laugh.*³\n\n\"You're finished. I'm going to let her know what you're doing. Don't forget, your current identity was given to you by her.\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman's voice carried an obvious sense of schadenfreude, like a kindergartener who had caught a classmate doing something wrong and was about to go tattle to the teacher.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed the water droplets on the floor floating up and sticking to the glass door frame.\n\n\"This is just her puppet clone. If we keep her here, what happened won't get out.\"\n\nThis was Tang Shi's reminder, and perhaps also her way of paying for her own self-righteous impulse just now. In an instant, the surrounding water droplets began to surge, shooting directly at the hair on the floor.\n\nThe Faceless Woman also saw the words. She let out a sharp shriek. The hair gathered together, and a gust of sinister wind rushed directly toward the door.\n\nHowever, the water mist condensed by Tang Shi now acted as a membrane, slowing the movement of the mass of hair.\n\nAt this moment, Bai Yingying also sensed that something was wrong. She ran over from next door, and seeing the scene in the bookstore, she opened her mouth slightly, somewhat baffled.\n\n\"You think you can stop me?\" the Faceless Woman let out a disdainful cry. \"We'll see how you stop me!\"\n\n*Buzz!*\n\nThe hair that had been gathered together instantly exploded. For a moment, the bookstore seemed to have turned into a barbershop, with countless strands of hair darting in every direction.\n\nSome tried for the air vent, some for the second floor, and others for the bathroom to get into the sewer pipes.\n\nIf just one strand of hair got out, it could transmit the news from here to the main body, and Zhou Ze's crime of hiding a \"wanted fugitive\" would be exposed.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails danced through the air. Each strand of hair he caught immediately turned to ash and dissipated.\n\nThe old Taoist once again fumbled in his pants and pulled out two paper talismans. He slapped them wildly in the air, and any hair that touched the paper talismans stuck to them like flypaper. It was quite effective.\n\nA workbook burst apart, its pages flying out like scythes, slicing through strands of hair, which withered as soon as they hit the floor.\n\nLying on the second floor, Tang Shi coughed, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. She was already injured, but she knew that at this moment, she absolutely could not hold back.\n\nBai Yingying was quick-witted and sharp-eyed. Her hands shot out continuously, pinching a strand of hair each time, grabbing it and snapping it in two.\n\nThe normally quiet bookstore, which saw almost no business, had now started a grand and vigorous \"deep clean,\" as if a high-ranking leader was about to come for an inspection.\n\nFinally, everything seemed to settle. The Faceless Woman let out a final, unwilling roar, and not another strand of hair could be seen.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a plastic stool. The bloodstains on his face had long since disappeared, because aside from the hair, none of it had been real.\n\n\"Boss, we're done. I'm exhausted.\" The old Taoist collapsed onto the floor, panting heavily.\n\nBai Yingying poured a cup of tea for Zhou Ze. She didn't seem tired. \"Boss, was it that same one from last time?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took the tea, and had a sip.\n\n\"She's really got her sights set on you. So persistent,\" Bai Yingying said, sticking out her tongue.\n\nZhou Ze didn't say anything, but his heart felt heavy. The Faceless Woman wasn't a huge problem, but she was the kind that left you unable to eat or sleep in peace. No one wanted to be targeted by such an opponent.\n\nAccording to her, her main body had followed the little loli to Rongcheng, leaving behind a few strands of hair as a puppet to deal with him.\n\nEven if it failed, she would still come and disgust him!\n\nAn enemy with such low tastes was truly infuriating.\n\nRight now, Zhou Ze's only thought was that he hoped that person in Rongcheng would take care of the little loli and the Faceless Woman together, and while she was at it, flush his troubles down the toilet once and for all.\n\nAlthough the difficulty was rather high, one had to have dreams.\n\nIn a tiny spot that no one had noticed, a single strand of hair secretly slid out from between the pages of a magazine, then fell to the floor, and finally drifted toward the crack under the door.\n\n*Creak!*\n\nThe glass door was pushed open.\n\nThe strand of hair happened to be stepped on by a leather shoe.\n\nXu Qinglang bent down, picked up the strand of hair, and snapped it in two.\n\nFrom the void, it was as if a woman's final roar of being thwarted at the last second could be heard!\n\nXu Qinglang paused for a moment, as if she had heard someone cursing her.\n\nBut she immediately pointed an angry finger at Zhou Ze, who was sitting inside, and roared:\n\n\"Well, well! I'm out here running around in this cold weather looking for a new shop location, and look at you! Look at this hair!\n\n\"Did some beautiful female reader come into the shop to chat with you again?\"\n\nThe implication being:\n\n*I'm out here busting my ass for our future,*\n\n*And you're holed up in the shop, enjoying the air conditioning and flirting with a long-haired girl!*\n\n*How could you do this to me!*\n\n***\n\n¹ A famous quote from the poem \"The Fisherman\" (漁父) by Qu Yuan, meaning to see the truth when all others are deluded.\n² A pyramid-shaped glutinous rice dumpling wrapped in bamboo leaves.

    "content": "\"Are you asleep?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Didn't you ask me to come sleep with you?\"\n\n\"Can't sleep.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"How long have you been alive?\"\n\n\"Two hundred years, but I've spent most of that time lying in a coffin. If you actually count it, the time I've properly spent living outside is less than twenty years.\"\n\n\"What do you think of your boss?\"\n\n\"Not great. Incredibly petty.\"\n\n\"I think so too.\"\n\n\"Did he scold you today?\"\n\n\"It was my fault.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"Actually, I've always been very curious. What kind of person is the boss, and that 'him' you two often mention?\"\n\n\"What kind of person?\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"Let's put it this way. If he and your boss had switched places in yesterday's situation, he wouldn't have waited for me to make a move. He would have killed that puppet himself. He wouldn't have been afraid of exposing anything, much less come up and ask me if I was meddling.\"\n\n\"Oh, so that's how it is.\" Bai Yingying mulled it over for a moment, then said, \"A person like that... probably wouldn't live very long, would they?\"\n\nTang Shi fell silent.\n\n\"Actually, the boss has a lot of flaws. Sometimes he's not 'man' enough, and he's always hesitant before acting. Even after he acts, he keeps dwelling on it. But all in all, he's actually okay. Everyone has their own different life, so naturally, everyone has their own different personality.\n\nHe likes to be cautious, like a squirrel that enjoys hoarding things for its home, savoring that feeling of accumulation and protecting that feeling. That's because he came from an orphanage. In the beginning, he truly had nothing.\"\n\n\"You can understand him?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say I understand him, but honestly, I really don't want to become like you are now. I like playing on my phone, playing games, and watching movies every day. I enjoy my current life, making up for the regret of lying in a coffin for two hundred years. In this respect, the boss is willing to indulge and satisfy me.\"\n\n\"Is a life without any ambition, without a few waves, even interesting?\"\n\n\"Not everyone yearns for waves and passion. Everyone should have their own way of life, as long as they themselves like it.\n\nTo be honest, sometimes I can see the boss holding himself back, and I'm also very worried that he won't be able to hold back and will become the same kind of person as you and the 'him' you speak of.\"\n\n\"Scared?\"\n\n\"I am scared.\"\n\n\"You've already died once. What is there to be afraid of? What is there left to fear? He's not to my taste. He seems peaceful and well-mannered, but deep down, he's full of a petty, self-serving ideology. He only thinks about himself. To put it bluntly, he's selfish.\"\n\n\"The boss is okay, I think.\"\n\n\"You disagree?\"\n\n\"I do disagree. I know that when my lady achieved spiritual perfection and descended to Hell, she must have told the boss to get rid of me when she handed me over to him, but the boss never did.\n\nBesides, I also know that because I'm in the store, far fewer ghosts come by, but the boss still hasn't kicked me out.\"\n\n\"That's because he uses you as a pillow. He wants to sleep soundly at night.\"\n\n\"A man who's willing to sacrifice business performance for a good night's sleep... isn't that a good thing?\"\n\nHearing this,\n\nTang Shi was taken aback for a moment.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nthe image of that figure who liked to sit on a chair in front of the Netherworld Store, basking in the sun, surfaced in her mind.\n\nThe sunlight sprinkled over his body,\n\nmaking him look just like an old grandpa.\n\n***\n\nWhatever the issue with the faceless woman was, it was at least temporarily resolved. Now, all they had to do was wait for the final result from Chengdu.\n\nOf course, that matter could wait, but moving the store could not. Xu Qinglang had found a new address, right near South Street in the center of Tongcheng, which was considered the commercial heart of the city in the minds of the old Tongcheng natives. The foot traffic was very high.\n\nYesterday, Zhou Ze had received an invitation to Miss Liu's memorial service. Zhou Ze didn't know why he had been invited and hadn't planned on going, but after seeing the signatory, Xu Qinglang had strongly insisted that Zhou Ze must attend, because the storefront he had his eye on was part of Miss Liu's family's property.\n\nDiscussing business with the family at their funeral seemed a bit wrong, but adhering to the principle of \"save where you can,\" Zhou Ze had agreed.\n\nHe took a car to the address on the invitation and found that it wasn't a funeral home. Instead, it led to a more rural area, to a villa built amidst fields.\n\nIt was the season when the rapeseed flowers were in full bloom, and the villa, nestled in a sea of flowers, gave off a very cool and detached feeling.\n\nNot many people had come. There were only four or five cars parked at the entrance.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze got out of the car and walked in, he saw Cui Yilang and several other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association standing in the courtyard, chatting in low voices.\n\nNo one greeted Zhou Ze, nor did anyone come to collect condolence money. A few scattered groups of people were there, looking as if they were on a spring outing.\n\nFrom the outside, the house looked no different from the three-story private residences built by villagers around Tongcheng, but upon entering, one discovered the interior was decorated entirely in an imitation Western European style.\n\nFrom the ceiling beams above to the coffee table and teacups below, it made one feel as if they'd stepped onto the backdrop of a British drama.\n\nMusic began to play just then. It wasn't the usual funeral dirge, but Chopin's \"Waltz of Farewell.\" Although it was about parting, the melody was much more cheerful than a domestic funeral dirge.\n\nA few women dressed in black veils came down from upstairs. This was the host family.\n\nA man who looked like a priest, holding a Bible, walked to the center.\n\nEveryone gathered around to share in the sorrow.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a cup of coffee from the self-service counter at the side and sipped it slowly.\n\nDomestic funeral customs had undergone several reforms in modern times, one might even say they had been completely overturned. Most regions had long since banned earth burials.\n\nFunerals in the countryside were usually held by setting up a canopy in front of the family's own courtyard. In the city, some held them in their own residential community or simply rented a venue at a funeral home.\n\nThis was the first time Zhou Ze had encountered a Western-style funeral.\n\nZhou Ze remembered hearing from someone that in some Western countries, there were many family-run \"funeral workshops.\" The first floor of their house was used for normal life and was also rented out as a venue for memorial services, while they also offered services like body collection, cosmetic restoration, and so on.\n\nLooking at this place now, it seemed to be following that style, but in this country, most people still couldn't accept it.\n\nNext was the viewing of the remains. Everyone lined up and went past one by one. If you were close, you could lean on the coffin lid and say a few words. If you weren't so close, you could walk past, sigh, and put on an act.\n\nWhen it was Zhou Ze's turn, he glanced into the coffin and saw Miss Liu lying inside, neatly dressed in a black formal dress, looking as if she had truly just fallen asleep.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze was that Miss Liu had fallen from the building right in front of him. No matter how you embellished it with words, you couldn't hide the fact that her death had been extremely gruesome. Yet, her remains appeared very exquisite; the restoration was exceptionally good.\n\nThis couldn't help but make Zhou Ze think of his own death, of the mortuary makeup artist who had held an eyebrow pencil and applied makeup to his face with great force and an impatient look. He certainly hadn't enjoyed this kind of treatment.\n\nThe dead can't leave a bad review. So unfair.\n\nAfter the viewing of the remains, everyone went to the side hall for a meal. It was a buffet, but there wasn't much food—just some pastries, sausages, and the like. It was merely meant to serve as an afternoon tea to tide one over; you couldn't possibly expect to drink and eat your fill here.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a glass of wine, drank some, and then walked out of the side hall. He planned to find Miss Liu's family to talk about renting the storefront.\n\nXu Qinglang had said he would lease it for a year first, and then Zhou Ze could pay him the rent monthly. This was a consideration for the fact that Zhou Ze couldn't produce so much money at once. Zhou Ze had to return the favor; if he could help negotiate the price, he should.\n\nBut after searching for a while, Zhou Ze couldn't find the family members in black veils who had appeared earlier. Instead, he saw the priest standing at the top of the stairs, smoking.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over, the priest offered him a cigarette as well.\n\nThe two men stood together, smoking.\n\nThe priest wasn't a foreigner; he was also Chinese, probably around thirty years old, with a somewhat baby face.\n\nThey didn't exchange many words. After finishing their cigarettes, the priest walked away. Zhou Ze stubbed out his cigarette butt and happened to see what looked like another staircase leading down below the main one.\n\nIt was probably a basement.\n\nOrdinary Chinese families didn't usually have the habit of building basements. Out of curiosity about the place, Zhou Ze still walked down and saw an elevator inside. Next to the elevator was a metal door.\n\nThe door was open. He pushed it open and walked in, immediately feeling the temperature drop significantly.\n\nIn front of Zhou Ze were two steel tables and a cold storage unit, similar to a hospital morgue, but with some additional equipment.\n\nIt gave one the feeling that this was a slaughterhouse.\n\nWalking over to one of the steel tables, Zhou Ze reached out and touched its surface. This was probably where the dead lay. Miss Liu had likely lain here before to receive the last beauty treatment of her life.\n\nThis was a beauty salon for the dead.\n\n\"Sir, this area is not open to the public.\"\n\nA young man in a gray suit stood at the doorway and spoke.\n\nZhou Ze nodded apologetically. He had been presumptuous.\n\n\"Have we met somewhere before?\" Zhou Ze asked, as he found the man somewhat familiar.\n\n\"Perhaps. This is my business card. Of course, we hope you never have the occasion to use the phone number on it.\"\n\nThe young man handed Zhou Ze a business card.\n\nThe name \"Chen Zesheng\" was written on the card, with the note: Director of Tongcheng Western-Style Funeral Home.\n\n\"Is business good?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nFor a long time, it had always been others asking Zhou Ze, \"Is business good?\" Now, Zhou Ze finally had the chance to ask someone else.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze was also aware that when others asked him \"Is business good?\", what they were really thinking was:\n\n*That idiot actually opened a crappy bookstore in this dump—it would be a miracle if business was good!*\n\n\"It's a bit slow. After all, not many people in this country accept this kind of funeral custom,\" Chen Zesheng said with a wry smile.\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nZhou Ze had asked his question. He felt satisfied.\n\n\"By the way, the deceased's family is on the second floor,\" Chen Zesheng reminded him.\n\n\"Alright, thank you.\"\n\nZhou Ze left the basement.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze started up the stairs, the hand holding the business card suddenly trembled. He looked down at the name on the card again:\n\nChen Zesheng.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nthe one who had committed suicide with Miss Liu the next day,\n\nhis surname was also Chen?\n\n***\n\nHe closed the metal door.\n\nThe young man in the suit lay down on the steel table.\n\nHe reached up and gently rubbed his right cheek. The skin had already wrinkled and cracked, and a green shaping fluid was seeping out from within.\n\nHe shook his head,\n\nand sighed:\n\n\"The moment I die, those two mortuary makeup artists at home start slacking off.\n\nAt this rate, how will the business carry on?\"",

    "content": "On the second floor, Zhou Ze saw Miss Liu's family. Strangely, he didn't see any men, only three women.\n\nOne had salt-and-pepper hair and was in her twilight years; one was poised and graceful, in her middle age; the last was about the same age as Miss Liu.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked in, he noticed the priest was there as well, speaking with the elderly woman as if trying to console her.\n\nThe old lady just listened, and the priest just spoke. It was as if they were just fulfilling their duties, going through the motions. To say there was much of a sorrowful atmosphere in the room would be a lie.\n\nOf course, you couldn't blame the living for their indifference toward the dead, because the problem the living had to face was how to continue living.\n\n\"Hello, are you Ms. Liu Yanhua?\"\n\nZhou Ze walked up to the middle-aged woman and asked.\n\n\"Hello, I am.\"\n\nMs. Liu took out a handkerchief and dabbed the corner of her eye.\n\nZhou Ze felt she was more likely wiping away sleep from her eyes than tears, because he really couldn't see any sign that she had actually been crying.\n\nThe woman's collarbones were very defined, and her figure was rather gaunt. Her brow bone protruded, giving her a look that was quite unsettling.\n\nIn truth, this was the kind of face said to jinx one's husband.¹\n\nCulture is a vessel, a fundamental unit. In every era, politics, economics, and even low-class things like physiognomy and feng shui are all influenced by the prevailing culture.\n\nFor example, the ancient concept of a \"husband-jinxing\" woman is a classic case of treating women as appendages of a patriarchal society. It's a very unfair and erroneous judgment.\n\nZhou Ze normally wouldn't have believed in such things, even as a ghost.\n\nBut when you thought about it,\n\nthree generations of one family,\n\nwithout a single male in sight,\n\nit was actually a little hard *not* to believe it.\n\nZhou Ze explained his reason for being there. Xu Qinglang had already spoken with her and reached a preliminary agreement, but they hadn't gotten down to the specific price yet.\n\n\"On behalf of my late daughter, I thank you for attending her funeral, Mr. Zhou. As for the shop, since you've taken a liking to it, please go back and think of a number for the rent. As long as it isn't too outrageous, I won't refuse.\"\n\nShe was that agreeable?\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment. He had been a doctor in his past life and had never done business, so this was his first time negotiating a price, and he was still a bit clumsy. But this Ms. Liu seemed very magnanimous.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, said a few more perfunctory words of condolence, and then tactfully took his leave. All that was left was to discuss a price with Xu Qinglang and send it over, and the matter would be more or less settled.\n\nHe went down the stairs and arrived at the corner again. Zhou Ze walked up to the metal door once more, reached out to push it, and found it was locked.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and knocked.\n\nNo one inside responded.\n\nIt was very frustrating.\n\nAnd very vexing.\n\nAs a Ghost Messenger,\n\nto be stopped by a single door, a single wall... this gig was a real loss of face.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze couldn't be like that little loli.\n\n*Biu,*\n\nshe was out.\n\n*Biu,*\n\nshe was back in.\n\nThis door, Zhou Ze really couldn't open it.\n\nHe returned to the main hall. The mourners had mostly left, and the hall was being tidied up. The coffin had been carried away. As for Miss Liu, she would likely be sent to the crematorium for cremation very soon.\n\nWhen a person dies, it's like a lamp being extinguished, ending up as nothing more than a mound of dirt.²\n\nFunerals always seemed to evoke this kind of pessimistic mood.\n\nZhou Ze stopped a cleaning lady and asked, \"Excuse me, do you know Chen Zesheng?\"\n\n\"Ah, he was the previous owner here,\" the woman answered, somewhat surprised. \"He's already dead. The funeral was yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze nodded, then asked again, \"May I ask who the current owner is?\"\n\n\"It's the previous owner's younger brother. He just went down to the basement,\" the woman replied. Then, worried Zhou Ze might not understand, she explained, \"See, over there by the staircase. It's the place for preparing the deceased's body.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked back to the metal door.\n\nHe had to get in.\n\nHe had to go in and capture that joker who, for some unknown reason, was still alive and kicking after dying and had even handed his business card to a Ghost Messenger.\n\nBut this door...\n\nhow on earth was he supposed to open it?\n\nHe knocked forcefully a few times.\n\nThe door remained still, and there was no sound of a response from within.\n\nThe cleaning lady had just said the current owner went in. Something was clearly not right. Of course, Zhou Ze wasn't concerned about whether the current owner might have met with some accident inside; he wasn't that merciful.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to look for a tool to try and pry the door open,\n\nhe saw the door swing open.\n\nA young man stood inside, dressed in a black suit with a white flower pinned to his chest.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" the young man asked.\n\nThis wasn't the guy who had just stuffed a business card in his hand. If nothing else, he must be the current owner, Chen Zesheng's younger brother.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to talk to you about, concerning your brother,\" Zhou Ze said. He had already decided that if this guy was uncooperative, he would just knock him out and go in to find Chen Zesheng.\n\n\"Oh, alright. Please, come in.\"\n\nThe man seemed quite easygoing, gesturing for Zhou Ze to enter.\n\nZhou Ze gave the man a long look, but stepped inside anyway.\n\nThe two steel tables were still in their original positions, and the cold storage freezers were there as well.\n\n\"Where is your brother's body?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My brother's funeral was held yesterday. Sir, were you a friend of my brother's?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" Zhou Ze said evasively.\n\n\"My brother's body was already cremated yesterday.\"\n\n*Are you kidding a ghost?*\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating that he understood, then turned and left.\n\nThe man in the suit watched Zhou Ze's retreating back, a hint of deep thought in his eyes.\n\n...\n\nThe evening breeze was cool. Under the moonlight, the rapeseed flowers surrounding the villa created a desolate atmosphere, as if for a grand funeral, for which everything here was mere decoration and foreshadowing.\n\nThe workers had all gone home. The villa didn't provide lodging, despite being large and spacious. Of course, the workers didn't want to live here anyway.\n\nThe man in the black suit placed dishes one by one on the round table in the hall. They were all cold dishes, without the slightest bit of warmth.\n\nThen he poured wine into the glasses on the table. It was old rice wine.\n\nImmediately after, he walked to the foot of the staircase and called upwards:\n\n\"Dinner is ready.\"\n\nThree women,\n\nfrom youngest to oldest, descended the stairs in order. They didn't stand on ceremony and sat down directly.\n\nThe priest hadn't left either and stood by the table.\n\nThe man in the suit went to the basement again. He wheeled out a gurney, a white sheet covering what was on it. Then came a second, a third, and a fourth.\n\nThe hall began to fill with the thick smell of plastic and disinfectant.\n\nThe elderly woman began to cough.\n\nThe middle-aged woman's face was displeased.\n\nThe young woman covered her nose and waved her hand.\n\n\"Why are there so many?\" Ms. Liu asked, dissatisfied.\n\n\"Since we agreed to hold a ghost wedding for my brother and my sister-in-law, it's only proper to have my father and mother attend as well.\"\n\n\"You people are a truly twisted family,\" the elderly woman muttered. \"No wonder your brother goaded my granddaughter into jumping off a building with him.\"\n\n\"You can't blame my brother for that. My brother always managed the family business; he wasn't ready to die. It's your family that has a tradition of men committing suicide. My sister-in-law was influenced by her upbringing, and that's why she took my brother with her.\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The elderly woman couldn't be bothered to argue the point. She urged, \"If you're going to do this, get on with it. I'm getting sleepy.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe man in the suit first lifted the white sheet from one gurney, revealing the body of Miss Liu.\n\nHe lifted Miss Liu's body and placed it on a chair, then used several plastic ties to bind her in place, ensuring she maintained a dignified sitting posture.\n\nNext, the man in the suit uncovered his brother's white sheet, lifted his brother's body, and sat him down in the seat beside Miss Liu.\n\nHowever, his brother's posture seemed to hold up quite well, not requiring any ties to fix it in place.\n\nThe man in the suit was a little surprised, but didn't pay it much mind.\n\n\"Those two poor souls. Why did it have to come to this?\"\n\nThe old woman squeezed out a few tears. It truly was a struggle for her.\n\nMs. Liu comforted her mother.\n\nMs. Liu's daughter, in turn, comforted her own mother.\n\nThe three women huddled together, crying, consoling, and confiding.\n\nThe new couple sat coldly in their seats,\n\ntheir eyelids shut tight.\n\nThey could not see.\n\nThe feast on the table was prepared for them,\n\nbut the drama at this table had nothing to do with them.\n\nThe man in the suit pinned red flowers to his brother's and sister-in-law's chests. He had hoped it would make them look more festive, but it only created a colder picture.\n\n\"Don't open their eyes. Let's not disturb them too much.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Liu saw the man in the suit about to use tape to prop the corpses' eyelids open, she immediately spoke up to stop him.\n\nShe had already overcome a huge psychological barrier just by agreeing to the ghost wedding. Now, sitting at the same table as two corpses, she was on pins and needles. If their eyes were opened, she really wouldn't be able to stay seated.\n\nThe man in the suit paused for a moment, but nodded in agreement.\n\nThen, the man in the suit called out to another gurney:\n\n\"Mom, it's my brother's happy occasion today. I invite you to come and see.\"\n\nWith that, the man in the suit lifted the white sheet, revealing the corpse of a middle-aged woman.\n\nShe was wearing a cheongsam and looked very wealthy and elegant, but she must have been dead for many years. Even the best preservation methods couldn't completely save her appearance.\n\nFrom deep within the skin, a greenish luster had begun to emerge. This was just a husk of skin, a shell that had undergone too many special treatments in an effort to preserve her living appearance as much as possible.\n\nHe settled his mother in a chair, placing her next to the old lady.\n\nThe old lady flinched in fear but said nothing.\n\nMs. Liu glanced at her \"mother-in-law\" and didn't dare to look a second time.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe man in the suit addressed the last gurney:\n\n\"Dad, it's your son's wedding today. Wake up...\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nA reply came from under the white sheet.\n\nThe man in the suit's body trembled, a look of terror on his face.\n\nThe three women at the table also began to tremble with fear. The young girl nearly screamed but quickly covered her mouth.\n\nEven the priest looked up suspiciously, completely baffled as to what part of the act this was.\n\nThe man in the suit no longer dared to reach out and lift the white sheet.\n\nBut the person underneath took the initiative and lifted the white sheet himself.\n\nZhou Ze stretched lazily, cracking his neck with a few crisp sounds. He said, somewhat apologetically:\n\n\"Sorry, my pillow was taken over by a stupid woman today, so I just borrowed your freezer to get some sleep.\n\n\"Not bad.\n\n\"It's just that I've gotten used to the good life. Sleeping in a freezer again has left me feeling a bit stiff.\"\n\n***\n¹A folk belief in physiognomy where certain facial features on a woman are thought to bring misfortune or an early death to her husband.\n²A Chinese idiom, `土饅頭` (tǔ mántou), literally \"dirt steamed bun,\" which refers to a grave mound.",

    "content": "\"I'm sorry to interrupt the gathering of your two families. I'm just here to take care of my business, and then you can carry on.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze got off the gurney and walked over to Chen Zesheng's corpse. He reached out and tapped him lightly on the shoulder. A black halo appeared, coalescing into Chen Zesheng's shadow.\n\nThis shadow was visible only to Zhou Ze; an ordinary person could not see it.\n\n\"We haven't finished the wedding yet,\" Chen Zesheng said to Zhou Ze. He himself appeared calm and unconcerned, as if the fact that he was about to be taken away by Zhou Ze was not at all surprising.\n\n\"Your wife is waiting for you down below.\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze forcefully grabbed him and started walking straight out.\n\n\"You! Stop right there!\"\n\nThe older brother didn't argue further, but the younger brother, at this moment, mustered his courage and pointed at Zhou Ze, roaring:\n\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing!\"\n\n\"I've already done what I came to do. Now, you all can continue.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze glanced deliberately at the priest standing silently beside the three women and gave him a smile.\n\nThe priest smiled back at Zhou Ze, his head bowing even lower.\n\nZhou Ze remembered the little loli once describing him as someone who \"really knew his place.\"¹\n\nFrom the looks of it now, this priest seemed to understand that better than he did.\n\nWithout any more words, Zhou Ze turned and left. The younger brother was still pointing at Zhou Ze, but he didn't dare to give chase. He was clear on one thing: he had personally pushed that gurney out of the freezer, which meant the man before him had actually been lying in that freezer for a very long time.\n\nHe felt that the world must have gone mad. Truly mad.\n\nDragging Chen Zesheng, he walked all the way out to the road, which was flanked by lush fields of rapeseed flowers.\n\nChen Zesheng then spoke up. \"Sir, I came to ask for your help.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you say so just now?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Because I realized you didn't seem very willing to help, Sir,\" Chen Zesheng said with a smile. \"My younger brother has some mental issues, and I can't help but worry about him. The family business was already doing poorly, just barely scraping by. With me gone, he might not be able to handle it alone.\"\n\n\"I've witnessed for myself that your brother has mental issues.\"\n\n*Indeed,* Zhou Ze thought, *for a guy who could orchestrate an affair where the entire family, even the dead ones, had to be neatly together, it'd be stranger if he* were *mentally sound.*\n\n\"But you say you're worried your brother can't handle it alone. Weren't you the one who jumped off the building before?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Heh, actually, I chickened out. We had agreed to jump together, but after she jumped, I got scared,\" Chen Zesheng said with brutal honesty.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then I felt terrible for what I'd done to her. The next day, after I gave my statement at the police station, I followed her and jumped too.\"\n\n\"I thought I would be able to find her on the Yellow Springs Road, but inexplicably, I found myself having walked back home.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's because my brother did too good a job restoring my body. Although those two morticians had some issues with quality control, at least on the surface, they restored my appearance to be exquisitely lifelike.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Chen Zesheng squatted down, took out a cigarette of his own accord, and lit it.\n\nThis was smoke from a burnt offering; ordinary people couldn't smell it.\n\nZhou Ze also took out a cigarette. To be honest, deep down, Zhou Ze had taken a liking to this fellow. He was decisive in his actions and straightforward in his speech.\n\nWhat a pity that a guy like this was already dead. Otherwise, it would be quite pleasant to be his friend.\n\n\"Have you been captivated by my personal charm?\" Chen Zesheng fluttered his eyelashes at Zhou Ze. \"People who know how to appreciate life and perceive beauty are seldom too bad.\"\n\n\"It's a little disgusting when you say that about yourself.\"\n\n\"Heh heh. My father started bringing me along with him when I was ten. My brother wasn't willing; he was terrified of corpses, so I was the only one to inherit the craft.\"\n\n\"I was afraid of corpses at first, too. But then I discovered their beauty, a kind of quiet beauty. This beauty allows you to immerse yourself in a certain emotion, like listening to a graceful piano sonata.\"\n\n\"I took care of their final appearances, and they, in turn, took care of my emotions. I gave them their final dignity, and they gave me a moment of peace.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I didn't want to die. If she hadn't been so set on dying, and if I didn't truly love her, I really wouldn't have wanted to die.\"\n\n\"I also find it regrettable that when I died, you weren't my mortician.\"\n\nThis was a heartfelt sentiment from Zhou Ze. The woman who did his mortuary makeup last time had stabbed him so painfully.\n\n\"Heh heh. Sir, let me ask you one more question. If I go down now, can I still find her on the Yellow Springs Road? I was a day late. I'm afraid I won't be able to find her when I get down there.\"\n\n\"You probably won't find her. The Yellow Springs Road is very crowded.\"\n\nThere was something he left unsaid: the people on the Yellow Springs Road, with rare exceptions, were all numbly shuffling forward on their tiptoes, like a series of formless, walking dead.\n\n\"Well, that's a real shame.\" Chen Zesheng shook his head. \"I'll try my best to look for her.\"\n\nZhou Ze pressed a fingernail into his own palm, then drew out a square. A black halo swirled within the rectangle, and an aura from Hell slowly began to seep out.\n\n\"Go on in. Go where you're supposed to go.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nChen Zesheng walked up to the square, and his form was sucked inside.\n\nDust to dust, ashes to ashes. The Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed. This was probably the most peaceful time Zhou Ze had ever had sending someone to Hell.\n\nAfter silently finishing the cigarette, Zhou Ze turned his head and looked once more at the villa nestled among the rapeseed flowers, thinking of the expressions on the three women's faces and the bizarre scene at the dinner table with the living and the dead sitting together.\n\nEven as a dead man, as an Emissary of Hell, Zhou Ze felt his scalp tingle at the way those two families behaved.\n\nA dead man like Chen Zesheng could depart with such ease and natural grace.\n\nAnd yet the living were like clowns in heavy makeup on a stage, constantly preening and posturing.\n\nThis world...\n\nit seems it has always been this way,\n\nand has never changed.\n\n...\n\n\"Ahahahahaha!!!!!!\"\n\nIn the middle of the day, Xu Qinglang's laughter rang out. He was laughing so hard he sounded like he'd found a hundred thousand yuan. In fact, it was pretty close.\n\nZhou Ze had returned late last night and had also gone to bed late. He'd only managed to steal a short nap on Bai Yingying's lap this morning before being woken up by Xu Qinglang's cackling.\n\n\"Old Zhou, you're the man! The Liu family just called me. They're renting us that storefront for fifty thousand a year. Fifty thousand! On South Street! That's practically giving it away!\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze wasn't too surprised. He'd gone to catch a ghost last night, took a nap along the way, and stumbled upon the two families conducting a ghost marriage. This must be his hush money.\n\n\"Come on, let's go check out the shop.\"\n\nAnd just like that, Zhou Ze was dragged by Xu Qinglang into a taxi to South Street. The storefront was across from South Street proper, facing Wenfeng Grand World and the department store.\n\nThe shop was over a hundred square meters, formerly a clothing store.\n\n\"Are you still planning to open a noodle shop?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Of course. I make delicious noodles.\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"Then why don't you see if their noodles are any good.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze pointed to the shops on either side of their new place.\n\nXu Qinglang looked over, and his face twitched. To the left of the shop were a \"Chongqing Xiaomian\" and a \"Qishan Saozi Noodles.\" To the right were a \"Lanzhou Lamian\" and a \"Wonton Noodle House.\"\n\n\"Didn't you notice this when you were looking at the shop before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, a look on his face as if life had lost all meaning.\n\n\"We'll see what to do later. You can move your bookstore over first. If it really doesn't work out, I'll just make coffee and sell little pastries in the bookstore,\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\n\"You were planning on this from the start, weren't you?\" Zhou Ze wasn't so easily fooled.\n\n\"As a man who owns over twenty properties, to allow my hands and skin to continue to be ravaged by grease and smoke... it's a crime!\"\n\n\"So whose sign do we hang up?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Let's use your 'Midnight Bookstore'.\"\n\n\"That works for me.\"\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze, simultaneously pulling a thermos from his pocket. \"Let's go get a bowl of noodles. I want to check out how good the noodles are here first. If they're terrible, I might reconsider and set up a little competition.\"\n\nThe thermos was filled with plum juice.\n\nZhou Ze didn't refuse. He hadn't eaten since he got up, so he followed Xu Qinglang into the Wonton Noodle House. They ordered two bowls of noodles and sat down at a small table to wait.\n\n\"Ah, the thought of moving here to do business in this bustling area is actually pretty exciting,\" Xu Qinglang said, looking eager.\n\nThen he noticed that Zhou Ze wasn't listening intently, but was looking slightly up.\n\nRight above them was a ceiling fan, spinning rapidly.\n\nThe temperature had risen noticeably recently, and the sun was strong. Moreover, because the noodle shop's kitchen was essentially inside the dining area without a partition, charcoal fire and steam lingered in the room. Without the fan on, it would be unbearably stuffy.\n\n\"What's so interesting to look at?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"When I was in school as a kid, I'd often sit in the classroom in the summer and stare up at these ceiling fans, terrified that one would fall down and hit me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Heh, what a coincidence. I used to worry about that too when I was a kid.\"\n\n\"By the way, do you know how to read feng shui?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My skills are half-baked,\" Xu Qinglang admitted without hesitation, then continued, \"Actually, it's very simple. If you don't feel particularly comfortable here, it means the feng shui is pretty good.\"\n\n*After all, you're a ghost.*\n\nZhou Ze thought deeply for a moment and found that what Xu Qinglang said made so much sense, he couldn't find a reason to refute it.\n\nTheir noodles arrived.\n\nXu Qinglang picked up a single strand and ate it slowly.\n\nZhou Ze opened his thermos, took a sip of plum juice, then shoveled a large mouthful of noodles into his mouth.\n\nLooking at himself wolfing down his food, then at Xu Qinglang's one-noodle-at-a-time posture, Zhou Ze shook his head and said:\n\n\"So pretentious.\"\n\n\"What do you know? I am carefully savoring the flavor of my competition.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze pushed his bowl away. He'd lost his appetite.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\nJust then, at the next table, a young man answered his phone and said into it:\n\n\"I'm at the Wonton Noodle House. I got here early. Are you here yet?\"\n\nThe young man looked like a university student, very green.\n\nAt that moment, a girl with a shoulder bag ran to the entrance of the shop. She stood there, holding what looked like a notification slip, and shouted excitedly at the young man:\n\n\"I passed! I passed!\"\n\nThen the girl ran directly toward the young man,\n\nher arms wide open,\n\nasking for a hug.\n\n\"I really envy the life of a university student,\" Xu Qinglang said wistfully.\n\nThe girl ran towards the young man and jumped right into his arms. The young man habitually caught her and lifted her up. This must have been a routine way these two young lovers expressed their passion.\n\nThis was the taste of youth,\n\nthe beauty of being young.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe ceiling fan was very low.\n\nAfter the boy habitually lifted the girl up,\n\nthe girl's head slammed right into the fan above.\n\n\"Thump...\"\n\nA human head,\n\nlanded on the table in front of Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang.\n\n---\n¹ A literal translation of the slang term \"懂逼數\" (dǒng bī shù) is difficult. It’s a modern, slightly vulgar phrase meaning to be self-aware, know one's limits, or understand the situation pragmatically. \"Knew his place\" captures the intended meaning in this context.",

    "content": "The police arrived, and so did the ambulance.\n\nOf course, whether the ambulance came or not no longer mattered.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang squatted across the street, surrounded by a crowd of onlookers.\n\nXu Qinglang still hadn't recovered from the scene just now; his hands were still trembling. He wasn't afraid of ghosts—he saw them often—but many things couldn't be measured simply by fear or lack thereof, but rather by the imagery of the moment, whether it had truly gotten to you.\n\nFor Xu Qinglang, who moments before had been savoring the taste of a competitor, the sudden shift in style was truly jarring.\n\n\"That was terrifying.\"\n\nAfter a moment, Xu Qinglang finally came to his senses. He lit a cigarette and asked,\n\n\"Can a ceiling fan really cut someone's head off?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Theoretically, it's impossible. At most, it would cause a deep cut.\"\n\n\"So this one went beyond the scope of theory?\"\n\n\"You could say that. Back when I was a doctor, I treated patients injured by falling ceiling fans, but I never heard of anyone actually being decapitated by one.\n\nIn fact, even ancient executioners had to practice extensively to behead a condemned prisoner in one stroke. It was common for the blade to get stuck in the neck without severing the head, making it impossible to pull out.\"\n\n\"Right then. Looks like the feng shui of this place really is no good.\"\n\n\"It's great,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Heh.\" Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Actually, danger is everywhere in life. For now, this can only be chalked up to their bad luck.\n\nFor example, if you're unlucky, you could get a deep gash just from rubbing a book page against your lips. Or take tomatine in tomatoes, for instance. It's a type of toxin called an alkaloid.\"\n\n\"Then how come I eat tomatoes all the time and haven't died?\"\n\n\"If you ate four tons, the dose would be lethal.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\n\"Eating four tons of *anything* would kill you!\" Xu Qinglang hissed, keeping his voice down.\n\n\"Alright, we've seen the shop, it's time to go. If we don't leave now, the police will want us for another statement.\n\nWe already gave one for that jumper a while back. If we do it again and run into someone we know, they'll really start treating us like we're Conan.\"\n\n\"What a rotten day. I came here all fired up, and then this happens.\" Xu Qinglang dropped his cigarette butt and stamped it out with his foot.\n\n\"I thought you'd be a little happy about having one less competitor.\"\n\n\"That's crossing a line. The poor girl just died.\"\n\n\"Oh? Then tell me, can the soul of someone who just died drift out like that?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the storefront ahead. Standing there was a girl in a yellow sweater.\n\nHer clothes were different from the deceased girl's, but this one had a graceful, slender figure, and her long legs were simply to die for.\n\nOf course, she would have looked even better if she'd had a head.\n\n\"Th-...\" Xu Qinglang was stunned.\n\nEven a soul with the greatest grievance would have to wait until the seventh day¹ to form into a vengeful ghost. They can't transform the instant they die. Besides, it's a matter of luck and probability; out of a thousand deaths, maybe only one soul will linger in the mortal realm.\n\n\"I knew it. How could a fan just slice a head off?\" Zhou Ze stood up and started walking in that direction.\n\nThat girl died. She deserves some justice!\n\n*Hiss...*\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously clutched his chest. The pain was starting again.\n\n*For my metrics, for my metrics, I'm doing this for my metrics!*\n\n*Yesterday, after taking in Chen Zesheng, my metrics went from eight percent to ten. Reaping one ghost only raises it by one or two points. At this rate, it'll take forever to become a permanent employee!*\n\n*This one's good. It can kill people. A ghost that can kill... is valuable!*\n\nWith that shift in perspective, the pain in his chest subsided.\n\nXu Qinglang followed him. But just as he stepped into the crowd, his vision suddenly blurred. He felt dizzy and disoriented, and collapsed straight onto the ground.\n\n\"F...\"\n\nThe palm of his hand, which had braced his fall, was scraped raw, and beads of blood welled up.\n\nXu Qinglang scrambled back up. The area was teeming with onlookers and cordoned off by police tape, but he couldn't find any sign of Zhou Ze or the headless girl.\n\nHe was bewildered.\n\nThe sun suddenly seemed harsher, and the air around him grew oppressive, making it hard to breathe.\n\nHe began to panic, a sense of dread creeping in.\n\nHe wasn't a powerful practitioner, but he wasn't a novice either. He shouldn't be this terrified by a simple headless ghost, yet he couldn't suppress the frantic feeling rising within him.\n\nHe started searching, weaving through the crowd again and again. He was looking for Zhou Ze, looking for the headless girl. He felt that if he could just find one of them, he could escape this frantic, senseless state.\n\nSearching, searching, searching...\n\nSearching, searching, searching...\n\nBeads of sweat dripped from his forehead. He was breaking out in a cold sweat, and his lips were chapped and dry. Xu Qinglang looked up at the sun, feeling like he could barely open his eyes.\n\n*Crack...*\n\nA sharp sound came from behind him and to the side. Xu Qinglang instinctively pushed through the crowd and stumbled in that direction.\n\nHe arrived at the entrance of a noodle shop.\n\nAnd then he saw Zhou Ze, sitting inside.\n\n\"There you are! I've been looking for you for so long!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was so overjoyed he could have cried. The confusion and despair he had just experienced were hard to put into words, like being banished into one's own nightmare.\n\nYou can't perceive the beginning,\n\nand you can't sense the end.\n\nXu Qinglang ran toward Zhou Ze, thrilled—truly, utterly thrilled.\n\nIn truth, he wasn't gay. His orientation had always been perfectly normal. It was just that heaven had given him the wrong sort of looks, and sometimes he played along with the joke himself, never taking it to heart.\n\nBut there was no denying that, in this moment, upon seeing Zhou Ze,\n\nhis joy was genuine and came from the bottom of his heart!\n\nLike seeing an oasis in the desert, like a starving man seeing a loaf of bread.\n\nHe lunged forward, he ran, he opened his arms.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze stand up, too.\n\nAnd then he saw the ceiling fan above Zhou Ze's head.\n\nThe fan was spinning,\n\nspinning very fast.\n\nA look of horror crossed Xu Qinglang's face. He wanted to scream for Zhou Ze to get out of the way, to yell \"No!\"\n\nBut his body, carried by momentum, kept running forward.\n\nHe seemed to foresee his own end.\n\nZhou Ze would catch him,\n\nthen lift him up,\n\nand then his own head,\n\n*Crack...*\n\nLike a cucumber being snapped in two.\n\nHowever, he didn't see open arms.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze lift his leg.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nA single kick,\n\nlanded squarely in his stomach.\n\nXu Qinglang fell to the ground, only to find himself lying on the side of the road. A car had just sped past in front of him.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was standing on the curb.\n\nDrenched in a cold sweat, Xu Qinglang touched his forehead.\n\n\"Did I just fall for its trick?\"\n\n\"You almost ran out and got yourself killed by a car,\" Zhou Ze said unhurriedly, as if he were remarking, \"My, what fine weather we're having today.\"\n\n\"That thing is that strong?\" Xu Qinglang asked, his heart still pounding with fear.\n\n\"She must have sensed we were tracking her, so she made the first move. This doesn't seem like a pure ghost—killing people is like drinking water to it. If I hadn't stopped you, you'd have been sent flying.\"\n\n\"If it's not a ghost, what is it?\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen a masturbating Monkey King?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\n\"I have,\" Zhou Ze sighed. \"She crossed the street and went into the mall over there. You shouldn't go. I'll follow her alone.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding? She almost killed me. You think I'm just going to let her go!\"\n\nXu Qinglang climbed to his feet and dusted himself off.\n\n\"I'll go home and start dinner. You go kill it. I'll wait for you to come back and eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Last night, he'd thought that priest really knew his place. Now he realized his neighbor got it, too.\n\nThe light turned green.\n\nZhou Ze gave a wave, crossed at the crosswalk, and entered the mall on the other side. Once inside, he resumed his search.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze sometimes felt frustrated. His powers seemed formidable—he could beat Bai Yingying until she screamed—but at other times, they felt completely useless.\n\nHe was a licensed professional now, but his abilities weren't always suited for ghost-hunting. Like right now. The headless woman had entered the mall, and amidst the crowd, Zhou Ze had completely lost her trail.\n\nMoreover, the reason Zhou Ze felt she wasn't an ordinary ghost was that her ghostly aura wasn't that strong. Yet she could kill in broad daylight and use illusions in a crowd to nearly make Xu Qinglang get himself run over.\n\nA typical ghost just didn't have that kind of power.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed a woman in a yellow sweater walking out from the side. But she had a head, and a few freckles on her face.\n\nHe subconsciously started toward her, but then he saw another woman in a yellow sweater in a different direction. And then, he saw several more.\n\nIt was only then that Zhou Ze realized the yellow sweater was the themed uniform for the mall's employees today.\n\nHow was he supposed to find her now!\n\nZhou Ze walked over to a refrigerated case, opened it, took out a bottle of mineral water, twisted off the cap, and began drinking.\n\n\"Sir, you have to pay for items before opening and consuming them here,\" a sales clerk in a yellow sweater said, walking up to remind him.\n\nShe was very young, probably a student working part-time.\n\n\"My apologies.\" Zhou Ze took out a ten-yuan bill and handed it to her. \"Could you pay for this for me?\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze reached out and pinched her cheek.\n\n*It feels real. It should be a real head.*\n\nThe girl, however, pointed at Zhou Ze, flushing with shame and anger. \"What do you think you're doing!\"\n\n*He gives me ten yuan, the water is two, so that leaves eight yuan... and he thinks he can do whatever he wants!*\n\n*First of all, I'm not that kind of girl! And second, to think you can take liberties with someone for just eight yuan—that's going way too far!*\n\n\"Sorry,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand, and squatted down on the floor.\n\nThe girl had been about to call for someone to catch the pervert, but seeing him do this, she held her tongue. Huffing, she took the money and headed for the checkout counter.\n\nZhou Ze extended his fingers. His black nails grew long, and he pressed them to the floor.\n\n*I refuse to believe I can't find you!*\n\nA wisp of black energy seeped from his fingertips into the floor.\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze saw black footprints appear beside him.\n\nThe footprints began to extend outward,\n\nleading all the way to the back of the young woman who was taking his ten-yuan bill to the counter to pay.\n\n***\n\n¹ *Tóu qī* (头七), the seventh day after death.

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood up, preparing to call out to the girl.\n\nBut at that moment, he was stunned to discover that the mall was covered in black footprints. It wasn't just the girl from before; the other customers, the salespeople—everyone's shoe soles seemed to be coated in a layer of black grease, leaving a clear print with every step.\n\nThis was a situation Zhou Ze had not anticipated. Could it be that everyone in this mall was a ghost?\n\nEven a ghost market couldn't be this exaggerated, could it?\n\nThe last time Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had witnessed Lady Bai's banquet, it was just a few rowdy tables of people, a far cry from the grand scale of this. Keep in mind, Lady Bai had cultivated for two hundred years and had even possessed her own temple shrine at one point.\n\nA dizzying, world-spinning sensation suddenly struck him.\n\nZhou Ze felt as if he were on a merry-go-round at an amusement park.\n\nEverything around him felt so unreal, so bizarre and fantastical.\n\nYou couldn't tell what was fake, nor could you figure out what was real.\n\nYou could only drift along in a daze, looking left and right.\n\nHe remembered that Xu Qinglang had seemed to experience the same thing not long ago. Then he had suddenly rushed into the road. If Zhou Ze hadn't kicked him, he might have been sent flying by a car.\n\nAnd now, that same feeling was washing over him.\n\nThat thing…\n\nWas it making a move on him?\n\nAs a ghost emissary, being counterattacked by the very ghost he was hunting seemed a bit pathetic. The deadliest part was that Zhou Ze had no idea how to fight back.\n\nHis understanding of ghost-catching had always been stuck in the inertial belief that his fingernails were invincible. But this time, it seemed his fingernails couldn't help him.\n\nStaggering, he sat down on the floor. Zhou Ze thought he saw someone in front of him handing him some change.\n\nHe vaguely heard someone say to him, \"Here's your eight yuan in change.\"\n\nThen,\n\nThe head of the girl in front of him began to blur. Everything in his vision seemed to be coated in a layer of paste, making him nauseous and dizzy.\n\nIt was as if he had returned once more to the Road to the Underworld, following the masses, numbly walking forward on tiptoe.\n\nThe Buddha says, there are myriad forms of sentient beings,\n\nBut on the Road to the Underworld, there is only one.\n\nZhou Ze felt he couldn't even draw a breath. He subconsciously grabbed his own neck. He lowered his head, coughing forcefully, wanting to scream but unable to make a sound.\n\nIt was a feeling that made each day feel like a year, a form of torture inflicted on the spirit. Xu Qinglang had easily broken down in it earlier, and now Zhou Ze, too, was trapped within.\n\nZhou Ze felt he should do something, but at this moment, besides passively enduring it all, there seemed to be nothing he could do.\n\nPain.\n\nOppression.\n\nSuffocation.\n\nA deluge of torments relentlessly flogged his soul.\n\n…………\n\n\"Sir, sir, what's wrong with you?\"\n\nThe girl handed the change to Zhou Ze, but suddenly noticed the man's eyes had grown cloudy. He looked like he was in great pain.\n\nThe girl's first reaction was that the man was a porcelain bumper¹, trying to pull a scam after drinking water from their store.\n\nBut after watching for a moment, it didn't seem like it. The man appeared to be in genuine pain.\n\n\"Sir, should I call 120 for you?\" the girl asked.\n\nWho would have thought the man would instead reach out, shove her to the ground, and then stagger to his feet, running all the way outside.\n\nThe girl had thought about calling the police or an ambulance, because she felt the man's state was very unstable, but in the end, guided by the principle that it was better to not get involved, she didn't take out her phone.\n\n…………\n\nEverything around him was like a mirror made of water, refracting all sorts of brilliant colors. The faint light that shone in offered no warmth, instead adding to an inner sense of agitation.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know where he was going or what he was doing. He had even mentally prepared himself for the possibility that he had walked onto the road like Xu Qinglang, waiting for a car to send him flying.\n\nHe could only engage in a kind of passive resistance. He didn't know where he was or where he had walked to, but he kept fighting the self-destructive impulse welling up inside him.\n\n\"Clang…\"\n\nA loud noise sounded.\n\nZhou Ze knocked over a trash can in front of him and fell into the pile of garbage. The pungent, sour stench failed to wake him. In his vision, lush green grass was everywhere, like a paradise beyond the mortal world.\n\nAlthough the scenery was beautiful, although the colors were vibrant,\n\nIt gave no sense of comfort at all.\n\nThis place was more like a cage, making one instinctively reject it, want to escape it.\n\nSounds of laughter and cheerful chatter came from all around. It seemed there was a group of graceful women dancing merrily, and in the distance, incense smoke curled upwards, as if countless people were worshipping at a divine altar.\n\nAll kinds of images flickered through Zhou Ze's mind, squeezing his nerves bit by bit. Any one of them could have been the last straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nFinally, the image froze.\n\nZhou Ze found himself standing at the gate of a familiar courtyard.\n\nThe sign for the orphanage hung above it.\n\nAnd in front of him, a couple was leaving a baby stroller there. They seemed about to leave.\n\nAfter growing up, Zhou Ze had asked the director about his birth. In fact, the director never hid such things from the children once they were old enough. He told Zhou Ze that he had been intentionally abandoned by his parents.\n\nFrom then on, Zhou Ze never again entertained the thought of looking for his biological parents. He simply considered his mother and father dead. He no longer needed them in his life.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly had a premonition.\n\nThe couple up ahead had to be his parents.\n\nAnd the child in the stroller…\n\nHad to be him.\n\nHe subconsciously lifted his foot,\n\nWanting to run over,\n\nTo see what his parents looked like, perhaps even to demand why they had abandoned him.\n\nBut the foot was only lifted;\n\nIt did not come down.\n\nA look of struggle appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\n\nHe instinctively sensed something. If that foot landed, it would be the abyss!\n\nAll the beautiful things had finally crystallized into this one scene. This was a poisoned pie, a trap set by a hunter, just waiting for the prey to take that step.\n\n…………\n\nOn the edge of the skyscraper's rooftop,\n\nZhou Ze, already standing on the parapet, teetered precariously. Again and again, he subconsciously leaned forward as if to fall, but each time he adjusted his center of gravity back.\n\nHe was struggling.\n\nHe was resisting.\n\nAnd his life was hanging by a thread.\n\nOn one side of the rooftop stood a headless woman.\n\nThe woman was no longer wearing the yellow sweater but a cyan robe of an old-fashioned style. It was damaged in several places, but she just stood there, cold and detached, facing Zhou Ze, who looked like he could fall at any moment.\n\nAnd on the rooftop, there was a third person: a priest.\n\nIt was a pity Zhou Ze couldn't open his eyes to see, or he would have surely recognized this priest from their recent meeting.\n\nAt Miss Liu's funeral, this priest had been present from start to finish, and apart from handing him a cigarette, he had not said another word.\n\nEven when faced with the strange, cold banquet of those two families, the priest had just stood to the side, watching quietly, as if admiring a ukiyo-e scroll.\n\nThe priest looked from Zhou Ze to the headless woman, and then back again.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\nHe spoke to the headless woman:\n\n\"Qingyi Niangniang, he is a ghost emissary.\"\n\nThis was a reminder,\n\nA reminder to the headless woman before him of the man's identity.\n\nBut this reminder was undoubtedly like pouring oil on a fire.\n\nThe priest, showing no awareness that he was fanning the flames, continued: \"If he is killed by you, it will provoke a reaction from Hell.\"\n\nThe headless woman suddenly turned to face the priest.\n\nThe priest gave a carefree smile and immediately changed his tune:\n\n\"But he is only a temporary ghost emissary, of an unranked grade. Even if he's gone, he's gone.\n\n\"At a time like this, anyone who dares to disturb Niangniang's mood deserves a bad end.\n\n\"Besides, Niangniang herself has done nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe headless woman turned back to face Zhou Ze, apparently sparing the somewhat meddlesome priest.\n\nThe priest stood there, continuing to play the role of a spectator. This seemed to be his favorite role.\n\nHe knew the identity of this headless woman and was even a little surprised that the ghost emissary he had met before hadn't recognized the woman's identity at first glance.\n\nJust how incompetent was this ghost emissary at his job?\n\nShe's not a ghost!\n\nShe's not an existence under your jurisdiction at all,\n\nYet you fixated on her, chased her,\n\nAnd in the end,\n\nYou angered her.\n\nWomen, you know, hold a grudge.\n\nEspecially this one,\n\nA woman whose days are numbered.\n\nThe priest's gaze shifted to the scene behind him. The skyscraper was high, and the view was excellent. He could see a construction site in the distance where demolition work was underway, dust and dirt filling the air.\n\nThe most direct memories an era can leave for people are, in fact, its buildings, and the current urban renewal and upgrading was undoubtedly a process of slowly erasing the marks of the past.\n\nTurning back again,\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze, still teetering back and forth on the edge,\n\nThe priest was also somewhat surprised in his heart.\n\nThis temporary ghost emissary could really hold on.\n\nEven if it were him, he probably couldn't have lasted this long.\n\nBut just then,\n\nThe priest suddenly saw the nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers slowly beginning to melt. But the molten liquid didn't drip down; instead, it flowed back into his body.\n\nZhou Ze's skin, at this moment, began to take on a bronze luster. This wasn't the bronze hue created by sun and exercise, but one tinged with\n\nDarkness,\n\nCurses,\n\nColdness,\n\nAnd a multitude of other negative presences.\n\nAt the same time, the priest noticed a green light slowly being released from behind Zhou Ze's tightly shut eyelids, like a ferocious beast that had been dormant and was now, gradually, being provoked into waking.\n\nFrom the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth, two fangs gradually pushed past his lips.\n\nBai Yingying had always been very curious about one thing: she was, after all, a jiangshi who had slumbered for two hundred years, but why was she thrashed so badly by Zhou Ze's fingernails!\n\nBefore him,\n\nThe priest, a look of disbelief on his face, gave her the answer.\n\nHis lips twitched.\n\nHe spat out two words:\n\n\"Jiangshi!\"\n\n---\n¹ A \"porcelain bumper\" (碰瓷) is a person who fakes an accident or injury to extort compensation.",

    "content": "On the rooftop,\n\n  Zhou Ze, at the edge, was slowly turning around.\n\n  The priest's lips parted, revealing a look of shocked disbelief.\n\n  The headless woman still stood there. The wind on the rooftop was strong, yet the hem of her dress didn't stir in the slightest.\n\n  \"This shouldn't be happening. As a Hell Warden, his physical body from his past life should definitely be gone. Most of them can only walk the mortal realm by borrowing someone else's shell.\n\n  So how in the world did this jiangshi¹ form?\"\n\n  The priest muttered to himself, his forehead practically covered in question marks.\n\n  As a qualified observer, being good at observation and diligent in thought are essential qualities for a bystander.\n\n  And as Zhou Ze turned around, the curve of the priest's once-parted lips slowly changed, becoming a smile as he said with sudden realization:\n\n  \"Sōdesu ne!\"²\n\n  Unlike his arms, which were beginning to take on a bronze color, the exposed skin on the front of Zhou Ze's body also showed a faint coppery sheen, but it was very light and uneven.\n\n  At the same time, the skin in some places began to wrinkle and crack, and fresh blood was slowly seeping out, creating a truly horrifying sight.\n\n  \"His soul carries a small part of a jiangshi's legacy, and now, under extreme mental stimulation, the jiangshi part of his soul is manifesting.\n\n  But his body is still that of an ordinary person; it simply can't withstand or inherit such a burden, which has led to this nondescript mess.\n\n  He is a jiangshi, and yet he isn't.\"\n\n  The priest muttered to himself, a hint of excitement showing in his eyes. His hands, hidden beneath his sleeves, opened slightly, and two scalpels appeared in his palms.\n\n  \"Which part should I cut off to take back for a slow study? Or maybe... I should just take the whole thing back?\"\n\n  Licking his lips, the priest looked somewhat troubled.\n\n  The other party was a Hell Warden, after all. The Green-Clad Maiden could disregard his status as a Hell Warden, but he couldn't. And if he let the Green-Clad Maiden kill him completely, then a corpse would have no research value for him to take back.\n\n  \"This is truly vexing.\"\n\n  The priest scratched his head, looking very conflicted. But the two scalpels in his hands glittered in the sunlight, and in that instant, the gazes of both the headless woman and Zhou Ze locked onto him.\n\n  \"Oh!\"\n\n  The priest's expression froze.\n\n  He immediately tossed the two scalpels to the ground, took a step back,\n\n  bowed slightly,\n\n  and said with great sincerity:\n\n  \"My apologies for the interruption. Please, continue.\"\n\n  For a bystander to draw themselves into the fray and end up dying an obscure death—that was a major taboo for observers.\n\n  Zhou Ze's gaze fell back upon the headless woman. To be honest, the Zhou Ze from before had been a \"back view killer,\"³ but now, the blood constantly seeping from his front and his tearing skin truly showed the utterly wretched state of his body.\n\n  To say Zhou Ze was a jiangshi now was less accurate than calling him Mr. Zombie A, an extra from some Western zombie movie.\n\n  The only difference was,\n\n  Zhou Ze's eyes glowed with a green light.\n\n  This made him look a bit more high-class than the extras in Western zombie films who could be killed with a random axe blow.\n\n  Mm, an upgrade from a regular extra to an extra with fifty-cents' worth of special effects.\n\n  \"Ah!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze opened his mouth,\n\n  and let out a roar.\n\n  It had neither earth-shattering volume,\n\n  nor surging, heroic spirit.\n\n  It was more like the wail of damaged vocal cords.\n\n  The headless woman continued to stand there, motionless.\n\n  Then,\n\n  Zhou Ze moved. His movements were exaggerated; he ran like a hundred-meter sprinter, his motions huge, and lunged directly at the headless woman.\n\n  There was no sound of impact, no splendid fireworks.\n\n  It was like a drunken man in a fit of rage tackling a delicate woman.\n\n  There was no sense of aesthetics to speak of.\n\n  Having tackled her to the ground, Zhou Ze pinned the headless woman beneath him and raised his fist to smash down on her.\n\n  \"Bang!\"\n\n  \"Bang!\"\n\n  \"Bang!\"\n\n  Punch after punch landed,\n\n  each one hitting the concrete rooftop.\n\n  All around were bloodstains.\n\n  Not the Green-Clad Maiden's, but Zhou Ze's.\n\n  \"Because in this state, he's left with only instinct and no room for thought, he's no longer affected by the Green-Clad Maiden's abilities, is that it?\n\n  And because he carries the aura of a jiangshi, he can touch a spiritual body and launch his own attack.\"\n\n  The priest opened his mouth and said, \"Oh.\"\n\n  \"How on earth did a person like this become a Hell Warden? Has Hell's screening process really degenerated to this extent?\"\n\n  Under the repeated heavy blows, it seemed as though Zhou Ze was just pounding on the concrete slab each time, but in reality, the Green-Clad Maiden's body was slowly distorting, like the surface of a pond, rippling continuously.\n\n  The surface of the water,\n\n  was no longer calm.\n\n  \"Looks like the Green-Clad Maiden is bound to lose. Although she doesn't belong to the order of ghosts, she doesn't possess any physical attack abilities beyond her mental influence.\n\n  Now she can only take a passive beating.\"\n\n  As he spoke, the priest looked again toward the construction site in the distance.\n\n  \"But it's almost time anyway. Whether she dies by that, or at the hands of the person before me, the outcome is the same, isn't it?\"\n\n  However,\n\n  just as his gloating ended,\n\n  the priest's eyes suddenly became murky.\n\n  The Green-Clad Maiden, pinned beneath Zhou Ze, suddenly flipped her left hand over in the priest's direction.\n\n  \"Made a mistake. I could have watched from a distance with binoculars, happily eating my own melon,⁴\n\n  why did I have to get so close?\n\n  This time, I'm going to be controlled and used as a thug.\n\n  What rotten luck...\"\n\n  The priest lowered his head, then snapped it back up, a green light showing in his eyes. Then, he quickly picked up the scalpels he had just thrown on the ground and charged directly at Zhou Ze.\n\n  \"Swish!\n\n  Swish!\"\n\n  The two scalpels,\n\n  plunged directly into Zhou Ze's back.\n\n  \"Ah!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze threw his head back, letting out a silent roar.\n\n  Immediately after, the priest, holding the scalpels, tried to drag them down along the wound, but the blades seemed to be stuck in Zhou Ze's bones, unable to move.\n\n  \"Crack!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze suddenly spun around, his arm sweeping across.\n\n  That's right.\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't know how to fight, had never studied martial arts, and certainly hadn't trained in things like Sanda or Muay Thai. Therefore, in his frenzied state, he could only counterattack based on instinct.\n\n  A mosquito bites me,\n\n  I slap the mosquito dead.\n\n  Zhou Ze's arm slapped directly across the priest's face.\n\n  The priest's entire face seemed to twist, and he was sent flying backward, landing right on the edge of the rooftop. If he had been just a little bit off, he would have fallen.\n\n  The left side of his face was badly swollen. He opened his mouth and spat out several broken teeth,\n\n  his mouth now stained with blood.\n\n  \"Baka!\"⁵\n\n  The priest flipped his hands over again, and two paper talismans appeared. These were the ghost-taming runes of an onmyōji.\n\n  As he charged at Zhou Ze again, he dodged Zhou Ze's punch and then slapped the two paper talismans directly onto Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n  For a moment, the runes seemed to burst into flame, leaving two scorched marks on Zhou Ze's chest. The scent of roasting flesh even began to drift through the air.\n\n  However, Zhou Ze simply wrapped his arms around the priest, and holding him tight, slammed him viciously into the rooftop's retaining wall.\n\n  \"Bang!\"\n\n  The concrete wall cracked and broke apart. The priest spat out a large mouthful of blood.\n\n  Two grown men,\n\n  on a rooftop,\n\n  because of a woman,\n\n  were fighting to the death.\n\n  ...\n\n  \"Hey, you over there, pay attention! Hurry up and tear it down! Knock it down before that bunch of old geezers gets here, quick!\"\n\n  A construction foreman was directing a bulldozer forward.\n\n  Ahead was a dilapidated old temple. It didn't enshrine any Bodhisattva or Daoist figure; in fact, the temple didn't even have a name plaque.\n\n  \"Boom!\"\n\n  The temple wall was pushed over, and along with it, the statue inside—so damaged its head had fallen off some unknown year—also collapsed.\n\n  The excavator and bulldozer worked together, finally leveling the temple completely.\n\n  \"Hey, what kind of temple was this?\"\n\n  The excavator operator got down from his machine. To be honest, this was the kind of situation he most feared during demolitions. Tearing down someone's temple could damage his yin-virtue,⁶ easily bringing misfortune upon himself.\n\n  Every trade and profession, more or less, has similar superstitions.\n\n  \"A small temple. When I was a kid, people still went to pray there, but not anymore. My grandpa even took me to pray there once. It was called the Green-Clad Maiden, or something. Similar to the Child-Giving Guanyin; people prayed to her for children.\"\n\n  \"Then why'd you have us tear it down?\"\n\n  \"If we don't tear it down, how can the project move forward? You have no idea how long a few of the old folks who lived here made a fuss with us because of this crappy temple. Who even prays to this bullshit Green-Clad Maiden anymore? There are infertility clinics everywhere. If you can't have a kid, just go see a doctor.\n\n  Besides, when I was little, I thought this Green-Clad Maiden was some big shot. Later, when I grew up, I found out there's basically no such person in history. It's just stuff passed down from old superstitions and old feudal beliefs. You could say we're debunking superstitions here.\"\n\n  The foreman spat a thick glob of phlegm on the ground and shouted:\n\n  \"Tell those guys to hurry up! I want this whole area demolished before sunset!\"\n\n  ...\n\n  On the rooftop,\n\n  the body of the Green-Clad Maiden, who had been pinned to the ground by Zhou Ze, slowly began to disintegrate.\n\n  The priest was right.\n\n  She wasn't a ghost.\n\n  As the Green-Clad Maiden disintegrated,\n\n  a flicker of clarity returned to the priest's eyes. He stood up, clutching his chest—God knows how many ribs were broken. When he saw Zhou Ze charging at him again, he was so frightened he threw open the rooftop door and fled into the stairwell without daring to look back.\n\n  But halfway through his charge, Zhou Ze's body suddenly stalled. He staggered, on the verge of collapsing, and the greenish-blue light in his eyes gradually faded away.\n\n  The bronze luster on his body also faded,\n\n  leaving only, from top to bottom,\n\n  the dense, horrifying wounds.\n\n  Zhou Ze's body swayed. He ended up walking to the edge of the rooftop, unable to control his movements.\n\n  One misstep,\n\n  and he fell right off.\n\n  The back of the building was a garbage disposal area.\n\n  Bags of household trash were piled up like mountains, and many stray cats and dogs foraged for food there.\n\n  \"Thump!\"\n\n  \"Meow meow meow!!!\"\n\n  \"Woof woof woof!!!\"\n\n  When Zhou Ze crashed down here,\n\n  he sent cats and dogs scattering in a panic.\n\n  Zhou Ze had already lost most of his consciousness; only his fingers were still curling instinctively.\n\n  Two bolder stray dogs crept closer, sniffing continuously at Zhou Ze's body with their noses.\n\n  \"Squeak squeak squeak!!!\"\n\n  Just then, a golden snub-nosed monkey holding a plastic toy hammer hopped up in a few bounds, waving the hammer to chase the two dogs away.\n\n  Then it looked at the man, who was covered in injuries and more dead than alive.\n\n  When it saw the man's face,\n\n  the monkey scratched its head.\n\n  It didn't know why,\n\n  but seeing this face made it feel very upset.\n\n  It couldn't remember its past and had been living here for a while. It had even tamed all these stray dogs and cats. Life as the boss of the garbage heap wasn't bad.\n\n  But this face,\n\n  it really annoyed the monkey.

    "title": "Chapter Eighty-Six: Days of Living with a Monkey",
    "content": "The small, abandoned work shed could barely provide shelter from the sun and rain. The surroundings were a chaotic mess, but at least there was no obvious trash. Instead, there were some children's toys, stacked neatly.\n\n  Oh, and there was a person, lying there.\n\n  Unfortunately, no reporter happened to be passing by at the time. Otherwise, if they had managed to snap a picture of the scene—dozens of stray dogs and cats dragging a person along together—its publication would have surely moved many people to tears.\n\n  The little monkey was kneading a pitch-black mass in its hands. It looked like a clump of mud, but this particular clump of mud appeared very clean.\n\n  Then, it took a little bit and slowly smeared it onto the wounds of the man beside it.\n\n  The man truly had too many wounds. Two burn marks on his chest, a piercing wound on his back, and countless gashes all over his body, flesh split open. After the application was finished, nearly half of the man’s body was covered in the dark mud.\n\n  Like a “Beggar’s Chicken”¹ about to be unearthed.\n\n  The monkey sometimes felt helpless. It really couldn't stand the sight of the man and often felt the urge to strangle him. But each time, after a period of conflicted frustration, it would subconsciously find a way to keep him alive, to prevent him from dying so senselessly right in front of it.\n\n  He should have been dead. With injuries this severe—even if falling from the rooftop ended with him landing on a pile of trash that absorbed most of the force—his original wounds were enough to kill an ordinary person several times over.\n\n  But he wasn't dead. The monkey would sometimes press its ear to his chest and hear a strong heartbeat.\n\n  Judging by the sound of his heart, he seemed quite healthy, not weak at all. But looking at him as a whole, the fact that he still had a heartbeat was a miracle.\n\n  It was as if his heart was a separate part, detached from the rest of him.\n\n  Even as the other organs of the main body had long since begun to fail, the heart continued to frolic and bounce about, doing just as it pleased.\n\n  Just like that, seven days passed. For all seven days, the man never woke up, remaining in a coma. The monkey tried to feed him some mashed-up food.\n\n  The food was all brought by the stray dogs and cats as offerings. The monkey mashed it up and fed it to the man, but each time, the comatose man would quickly spit it out.\n\n  This infuriated the monkey. It had given him the cleanest, most delicious rations, which were meant for itself, and he had the audacity to spit them out!\n\n  The monkey felt its lifestyle was a bit lacking in class. Look at this—food that it considered wonderful was being instinctively rejected by someone, even in a coma.\n\n  *He's looking down on this great one!*\n\n  Disgruntled, the monkey found a half-empty jar of \"Lao Gan Ma\"² in the shed and fed it directly to him. The monkey had tried it before; it was so spicy it had jumped up and down.\n\n  To the monkey's astonishment, the guy actually swallowed it. The monkey then brought some more food over, mashed it up, and continued feeding him, and he ate that too.\n\n  The monkey was stunned.\n\n  *What the hell kind of intense palate does he have!*\n\n  Finally, on the eighth day, Zhou Ze's eyelids trembled slightly. He slowly opened his eyes, somewhat baffled as to where he was. It wasn't a hospital, nor was it the bookstore.\n\n  It looked more like a simple shelter for a homeless person.\n\n  At the same time, a furry tail was swaying back and forth in front of him.\n\n  A little girl's face was right in front of him.\n\n  Oh no,\n\n  A bright red apple was right in front of him.\n\n  That didn't seem right either.\n\n  Finally,\n\n  Zhou Ze saw it clearly.\n\n  A monkey's... butt was right in front of him.\n\n  The monkey was holding mud and smearing it onto his wounds. Zhou Ze could even smell the earthy scent of the soil. He grew anxious, wanting to speak up and warn the monkey that this might cause his wounds to get infected and fester. But when he opened his mouth, Zhou Ze could only manage to make \"uhh... uhh...\" sounds.\n\n  His lips were dry and chapped, and his throat was extremely sore. He couldn't get his voice to work at all.\n\n  The sound startled the monkey. It finally turned its \"little girl's face\" around and faced Zhou Ze with its actual face.\n\n  Man and monkey began to stare at each other.\n\n  The monkey suddenly scratched its ears and cheeks. *This guy is awake, but the way he looks with his eyes open seems even more punchable!*\n\n  Zhou Ze, on the other hand, felt the situation was absurd. He had somewhat forgotten the memory of that day on the rooftop, only remembering that he had a good, satisfying fight.\n\n  It felt like he was fighting a woman, and also like he was fighting a Japanese person. In short, the fight was a muddle, and the ending was just as muddled.\n\n  The feeling was like that of a person who drank too much waking up the next day, with spotty memories of what happened while drunk.\n\n  If he couldn't speak, then he wouldn't speak. If he couldn't move, then he wouldn't move. If there was a monkey next to him, then so be it.\n\n  His life as a bookstore owner since his soul's return in a borrowed body had successfully transformed the once diligent Dr. Zhou, who was determined to climb the ladder, into a handsome man who knew how to be at peace with whatever came his way.\n\n  Like an eighty- or ninety-year-old man, he had learned to let go of what needed letting go. And Zhou Ze, after all, had already died once.\n\n  The monkey continued its daily routine of smearing mud on his wounds and feeding him Lao Gan Ma, followed by spicy gluten strips, Wang Zai milk snacks³, half a chicken leg, and other such foods.\n\n  Then, after taking care of him each day, it would stand before him, holding a plastic toy hammer, and repeatedly hit its own head, looking very displeased.\n\n  Zhou Ze thought this monkey might be a little mentally unstable.\n\n  However, this monkey was genuinely smart, not like an ordinary monkey. It could even understand the meaning in your gaze. But for most of the day, after it was done tending to Zhou Ze, it was unwilling to linger by his side for too long.\n\n  It would often stick its butt out, pointing its \"little girl's face\" at Zhou Ze, while it stared at the sun or the moon in the sky, lost in thought.\n\n  This was a monkey with a story, one that even knew how to contemplate life.\n\n  In the first few days after waking up, Zhou Ze didn't find anything unusual. But after four or five days, he suddenly thought of something.\n\n  The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven⁴, bursting forth from a stone was already a remarkable event.\n\n  For a small city like Tongcheng to produce such \"human-like\" monkeys one after another seemed highly unlikely.\n\n  And a few days ago, he seemed to have just met a monkey.\n\n  And then,\n\n  he had killed that monkey.\n\n  That incident ultimately led to a very fucked up matter. An old codger claiming to be his servant had treated him to a meal, then made a dish out of his conscience.\n\n  But that monkey, he had definitely killed it. Even if he hadn't managed to find its soul in the end, it should have lost its physical body.\n\n  One evening, the monkey came back from its outing. In its hand was a rolled-up newspaper. Unfurling the paper revealed a youtiao⁵ inside.\n\n  Zhou Ze could now just about swallow on his own. The monkey tore off a piece of the youtiao, fed him a bite, then dipped another piece in Lao Gan Ma and fed it to Zhou Ze.\n\n  Man and monkey had, over this period, developed a certain rapport.\n\n  Halfway through the youtiao, the monkey suddenly froze. It was looking at the newspaper.\n\n  Zhou Ze was a little surprised. He knew the monkey was smart, but he hadn't expected it to be smart enough to read a newspaper.\n\n  It was like having a pet dog. If it could relieve itself in a designated spot and follow your commands to sit and lie down, you'd already think it was very smart. But if one day you saw your dog sitting on the toilet and then flushing it,\n\n  you wouldn't think it was smart; you'd think it was terrifying.\n\n  Fortunately,\n\n  the monkey wasn't actually reading the words.\n\n  It was looking at the cover photo of the newspaper.\n\n  \"Three-Legged Boy's Surgery a Success.\"\n\n  The monkey stared at the picture,\n\n  stunned for a long time.\n\n  Like a person, it sighed, then raised a hand to wipe its eyes.\n\n _  \nZhou Ze looked at the monkey. At this moment, he felt no fear. Yes, this was the monkey he had killed; he could be sure of it now.\n\n  And right now, this monkey was repaying injury with kindness.\n\n  It had saved him. Although he didn't know what was special about that mud, it had at least kept his injuries in check.\n\n  Back then, the monkey's cultivation had been ruined because the lumberjack it had saved captured it, took its brain, and ate its flesh. But it seemed that even if this monkey had lost some of its previous memories, its fundamental nature remained the same.\n\n  The monkey looked melancholic. It then continued to share the rest of the youtiao with Zhou Ze. The monkey found a rope and tied one end around Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't react, letting the monkey do as it pleased, even as the rope was looped around his neck. The monkey then sat down on the edge of Zhou Ze's bed.\n\n  It looked at Zhou Ze, and Zhou Ze looked back at it.\n\n  There was a glint of tears in the monkey's eyes, along with anger, hatred, and unwillingness.\n\n  Just as Zhou Ze had recognized it, it seemed the monkey had recognized Zhou Ze too.\n\n  The enmity between the two of them, it was hard to say who was right and who was wrong. But if either side said it was time for a final settlement, it would seem perfectly reasonable.\n\n  The monkey slowly tightened the rope. It could easily strangle Zhou Ze to death right now, just as Zhou Ze had killed it in the hospital by piercing its body with his fingernails.\n\n  Zhou Ze lay there, seemingly without any ability to resist.\n\n  Just then, a few stray dogs appeared outside the shed. Their animal instincts told them there might be a big meal soon.\n\n  Their level of intelligence naturally couldn't comprehend why their Monkey Big Bro would want to kill this person after saving him. They probably figured he was fattening the person up to make the meat taste better.\n\n  But the monkey suddenly whirled around and bared its teeth at the dogs outside.\n\n  The few stray dogs were terrified and fled in disarray.\n\n  The monkey looked back at Zhou Ze dejectedly, then reached out and untied the rope from his neck.\n\n  *Smack!*\n\n  The monkey slapped itself across the face. A very loud slap.\n\n  Then it hopped off the bed, rummaged through the pile of junk, and found a phone with a cracked screen. It then hopped back in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n  The phone was on. It was something the monkey had brought back yesterday, and Zhou Ze could see a signal indicator on the cracked screen, which meant it had a working SIM card inside.\n\n  The monkey knew what a phone was. It pointed its claw at the buttons on the phone, signaling for Zhou Ze to tell it what to press.\n\n  Zhou Ze raised his hand and took the phone from the monkey.\n\n  The monkey was stunned by Zhou Ze's action. It hadn't expected that he could already move.\n\n  And if his hand could move, then his fingernails could move too.\n\n  A moment later,\n\n  Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n  Then the monkey picked up its plastic toy hammer again.\n\n  This time, it was aimed at Zhou Ze's head:\n\n  \"Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!!!\"\n\n  *See you pretending!*\n\n  *See you pretending!*\n\n  *See you pretending!*\n\n  After a bit of hammering,\n\n  the monkey tossed the plastic toy hammer aside,\n\n  sat there,\n\n _  \nand smiled too.\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Beggar's Chicken (叫花雞):** A famous Chinese dish where a whole chicken is stuffed, wrapped in leaves, and then encased in clay or mud before being slow-cooked.

    "content": "Holding the phone, Zhou Ze managed to struggle up and sit, leaning against the plank wall. In truth, he could already move a little. He might not be able to get out of bed and walk around, but in other respects, he really wasn't as weak as he'd appeared.\n\nHe stretched out a hand and pointed to a spot under the bed.\n\nThe little monkey turned its head and saw half a pack of already opened Little Su cigarettes.\n\nIt jumped down, picked up the cigarettes, and placed them in Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nZhou Ze then made a gesture for a lighter.\n\nThe little monkey froze for a moment, then grew deeply ashamed and indignant, as if it wanted to pull out its big club and beat Zhou Ze with it!\n\n\"Haven't had a smoke in a long time. I'm craving one.\"\n\nThe little monkey jumped off the bed again, rummaged through a pile of junk, and actually managed to find a lighter, which it tossed over.\n\nLighting the cigarette, he took a drag and blew out a smoke ring. Although his body was still weak, like a canvas covered in countless patches, ready to fall apart at any moment, this first cigarette in over ten days still gave Zhou Ze a sense of deep satisfaction.\n\nHe was deliberately pretending he couldn't move. As for why, Zhou Ze couldn't say for sure.\n\nWas it guilt?\n\nA sense of indebtedness?\n\nMaybe, maybe not. Even now, Zhou Ze didn't feel he had made the wrong choice back then.\n\nBut at the very least, this monkey had indeed saved his life, and he owed it a great deal.\n\nHolding his phone, Zhou Ze thought for a moment and realized he didn't remember the numbers for Bai Yingying or Xu Qinglang. It wasn't like the old days of using public phones at corner stores; nowadays, few people bothered to memorize phone numbers, storing them directly in their contacts instead.\n\nWith no other choice, Zhou Ze could only dial \"110.\"\n\nXu Qinglang and the others had indeed filed a missing person's report. Zhou Ze told the operator on the phone that he was fine and asked them to help contact the reporting party to come pick him up, so as not to trouble the police officers.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Xu Qinglang arrived in a Nissan. Bai Yingying was in the car with him.\n\nUpon entering the shack while holding his nose, Xu Qinglang's eyes immediately reddened when he saw Zhou Ze lying on the bed, but he quickly reined in his emotions.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nthe cruelest thing in this world,\n\nis to say \"I'm going home to cook,\"\n\nand for you to never come back to eat.\n\nBai Yingying lifted Zhou Ze off the bed. She was incredibly strong; carrying Zhou Ze was like child's play for her.\n\nZhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang, who was standing to one side, \"Bring that monkey, too.\"\n\nThe little monkey was sitting by the bed, watching Zhou Ze being carried away. It held its small plastic hammer in its hand,\n\nwaving it,\n\nas if in farewell.\n\nHowever, when Xu Qinglang approached it, the little monkey leaped onto the plank wall. It clearly didn't want to leave.\n\nBeing the local king¹ here, with an army of cat and dog soldiers, getting tributes from so many underlings every day—life was good. It had no desire to leave.\n\nBesides, it still found the guy it had rescued a bit of an eyesore.\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze repeated, \"Take it.\"\n\nNo room for negotiation.\n\nThe pet I've set my sights on, has to come with me.\n\nXu Qinglang tried to grab the monkey, but it was too nimble for him to catch.\n\nBai Yingying settled Zhou Ze in the car, then dashed forward in a single bound. The monkey hadn't expected the woman to be so fast; it jumped a second too late and was caught by the tail.\n\n\"Screech screech screech!!!\"\n\nThe monkey bared its teeth at Bai Yingying, its face ferocious!\n\n*You wretched hag,*\n\n*you dare grab me!*\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nBai Yingying opened her mouth at the monkey, revealing her zombie fangs.\n\nThe sight of her green face and long fangs,\n\nscared the monkey silly.\n\n*Keep acting up,*\n\n*and believe me, this lady will eat you!*\n\n\"Be good, and come with Auntie.\"\n\nWith one hand supporting the monkey's rear and the other holding its tail, Bai Yingying put it in the car, then closed the door and windows.\n\nZhou Ze was half-lying on the back seat.\n\nThe monkey sat next to Zhou Ze,\n\narms crossed, clearly sulking.\n\nIt felt that it had saved Zhou Ze, only for Zhou Ze to turn around and rob it of its freedom. This was not right!\n\n*I treated you like a patient, but you want to lock me in a room and tame me!*\n\n\"I'm taking you with me because I'm afraid you'll get hurt by people while trying to save them again,\" Zhou Ze explained weakly. \"Let's consider the grudges of our past lives settled. In this life, I owe you first. Stay with me for a while. If you still want to leave later, you can go.\"\n\nThe monkey, whether it understood or not, did seem to quiet down a bit.\n\nXu Qinglang tossed over a pack of biscuits. The monkey caught it, tore open the package itself, and began eating with its hands, not forgetting to pop one into Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nThe man and monkey had developed this kind of daily rapport.\n\n\"Well, now. Looks like I worried for nothing. You two seem to have been living quite comfortably lately,\" Xu Qinglang teased as he drove.\n\n\"Are you jealous of a monkey?\" Bai Yingying suddenly interjected.\n\nXu Qinglang was struck speechless and said no more.\n\nThe bookstore hadn't been moved yet. With the boss, Zhou Ze, suddenly disappearing for half a month, no one was in the mood to relocate. So, Xu Qinglang drove back to the old place.\n\nAfter getting out of the car,\n\nit was again Bai Yingying who carried Zhou Ze into the bookstore. Zhou Ze, for his part, accepted it calmly. Given the choice between Xu Qinglang and Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze found being carried by Bai Yingying more acceptable.\n\nThe monkey didn't run away, but followed them step by step into the bookstore.\n\n\"You're back?\"\n\nThe old Taoist was cleaning the bookstore. Seeing Zhou Ze's return, he immediately came over to flatter him, saying:\n\n\"The virtuous are protected by heaven.\"\n\nThen, the old Taoist noticed the monkey behind them and chuckled. \"And you brought a pet back?\"\n\nWith that,\n\nthe old Taoist struck a pose like the Monkey King and shouted:\n\n\"What use have I for this iron staff!\"²\n\nUnexpectedly, the little monkey played along, striking a pose of its own, scratching its head and ears, pointing at the old Taoist with one hand while scratching with the other.\n\n\"Heh, this monkey's smart. Just like me.\"\n\nAfter saying it, the old Taoist felt that something about his statement was off.\n\nJust as they entered the shop, a woman walked down the stairs.\n\nThe first thing to appear was a pair of flesh-toned stockings, followed by long legs, an exquisite high school girl's uniform, and shoulder-length hair.\n\nTang Shi had mostly recovered and was able to walk again.\n\nAll women love beauty. The first thing she did upon regaining her mobility was to dress herself up.\n\nIn this regard, Zhou Ze felt Bai Yingying was much simpler. That big, silly girl, aside from her love of video games, didn't pay much attention to her appearance.\n\n\"If you hadn't come back soon, we would have had to leave,\" Tang Shi said with a smile. \"When the dog's not around, the smell of the kennel fades, and we can't hide anymore.\"\n\n\"I just got back. Can't you say something nice?\" Zhou Ze was truly at a loss with this woman.\n\n\"Fine, I'll say something nice. The owner of the noodle shop next door told me what happened that day. Do you have any idea what you provoked?\"\n\n\"Something called the Green-robed Lady, I think,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"A temple deity. A temple deity on the verge of being completely overthrown. And you took the initiative to provoke her. Don't you know her days were already numbered, and that she knew it too?\"\n\n\"She was killing people.\"\n\n\"Do you know what kind of people she was killing?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the monkey, still playing around with the old Taoist, shook his head, and said:\n\n\"I have no interest in knowing.\"\n\nTang Shi walked over to Zhou Ze, then covered her nose in disgust.\n\n\"You stink.\"\n\n\"That's why they call us stinking men.\"\n\n\"Were you always such a smooth talker?\" Tang Shi wasn't angry.\n\n\"You were lying up there like a mummy before. Who would be interested in talking smoothly to you?\" Zhou Ze pointed at the bathroom and said to Bai Yingying, \"Help me take a bath.\"\n\nBai Yingying froze for a moment,\n\nbut the big, silly girl quickly replied, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\nIn his current state, it was impossible for Zhou Ze to bathe himself, but he was covered in layers of mud and felt disgusting.\n\nLet Xu Qinglang help him?\n\nHe couldn't stand the thought of it.\n\nLet the old Taoist help him?\n\nThe thought of the old Taoist singing *Xintianyou* folk songs while scrubbing his back, coupled with the sight of the man's rail-thin body... there was no appeal in that.\n\nAs for Tang Shi, forget it. If he asked her for help, she'd probably rather use her powers to \"swoosh\" a pen over and put him out of his misery.\n\nThat only left the simple and kind Bai Yingying.\n\nInside the bathroom, Zhou Ze sat on a stool while Bai Yingying helped him take off his clothes. She didn't take off her own, so the bathing scene wasn't as steamy as one might imagine.\n\nHolding the shower head, she slowly rinsed the mud from Zhou Ze's body. Seeing the wounds that covered his entire frame, Bai Yingying's mouth hung open in astonishment. She asked:\n\n\"Boss, your injuries are terrifying. That Green-robed Lady is a real piece of work. I heard her temple was torn down. Serves her right.\"\n\n\"She didn't do this,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Actually, most of these injuries, I did to myself.\"\n\nIt was hard for Zhou Ze to understand that state he'd been in, and he didn't even know if he could enter it again at will. But one thing was certain: if he were to repeat what he did on that rooftop, he would end up covered in wounds all over again.\n\nThis body of his, to be frank, was a bit too weak.\n\nBai Yingying began to lather shower gel on him, her hands roaming over his body.\n\nUnconsciously, a look of fascination appeared on her face. At the same time, she said:\n\n\"Boss, I don't know why, but when I touch your body, I feel... I really like this feeling. It's a feeling of great intimacy.\"\n\nAs a *jiangshi*, Bai Yingying could sense a kindred spirit in Zhou Ze. Moreover, although this kindred spirit seemed very weak, the kind of pressure that came from a vast difference in their class gave her a primal urge to submit.\n\nBai Yingying had felt this earlier, too, when she was carrying him.\n\n\"Just focus on the bath. Don't mess around,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang coughed from outside the bathroom.\n\nBai Yingying's body tensed. Her fingertips began to rapidly rub back and forth over the two raised nodules on Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Beauty Xu and I made a bet to see if the boss could actually get hard.\"\n\nAs she spoke,\n\nBai Yingying even lowered her head,\n\ndeliberately looking down.\n\nThen, her mouth flew open as she let out a gasp of shock:\n\n\"Boss, you actually...\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ **Local king (草頭王 - cǎo tóu wáng):** Literally \"grass-head king.\" An idiom for a local bandit chief or a petty tyrant ruling a small, unofficial domain.\n\n² **\"What use have I for this iron staff!\" (我要這鐵棒有何用！):** A famous line from the classic 1986 TV series *Journey to the West*, spoken by Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.

    "content": "After his bath, Zhou Ze, dressed in a white shirt and casual pants, was carried out by Bai Yingying and placed on a bamboo mat on the second floor. When Bai Yingying came downstairs, Xu Qinglang immediately came over and asked:\n\n\"What's the situation?\"\n\nSecretively,\n\ncautiously,\n\nthe feeling was very much like running an illegal casino, terrified that the police would burst in at any moment to bust the game.\n\nBai Yingying looked like she wanted to say something but hesitated, her face flushed red.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned.\n\n*You're a damn jiangshi, what the hell are you blushing for?*\n\n\"So how is it?\" Xu Qinglang pressed, desperate to know the answer.\n\n\"Um…\" said Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Speak up, did he get hard or not?\" Xu Qinglang said impatiently.\n\n\"Well…\" said Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Don't tell me he has a slit down there?\"\n\n\"Um…\" said Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Or maybe his is smaller than yours when you pull it out?\"\n\n\"Huh…\" said Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Hey, stop beating around the bush. Do you still want that new graphics card or not?\"\n\n\"The boss said he'd get me a new top-of-the-line gaming rig after the store moves,\" Bai Yingying said sheepishly.\n\n\"You've been bribed?\" Xu Qinglang's face darkened.\n\n\"Yup,\" Bai Yingying admitted honestly.\n\n\"That's not right. At most, he only has a little over ten thousand on him. He still has to renovate the new place, and I'm covering the rent for now. He doesn't have that kind of money.\"\n\n\"The boss asked me for two jade hairpins, pawned them for five hundred thousand, and said he'd pay me back seven hundred and fifty thousand in half a year.\"\n\n\"He tricked you into pawning your grave goods?\" Xu Qinglang looked at her like she was an idiot. \"Are you stupid?! Those are your burial items!\"\n\n\"The boss said he'd give them back,\" Bai Yingying muttered.\n\n\"You believe anything he says? If he said he was your jiangshi ancestor, would you believe that too?\"\n\n\"I would,\" Bai Yingying said quietly.\n\nBecause she really did feel the aura of a jiangshi on the boss.\n\n\"You're a lost cause, you silly girl.\" Xu Qinglang looked at her with an expression of deep disappointment. \"By the way, let me ask you something. Do you have any sisters?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I want to find a female jiangshi to be my maid, too. It's a business with incredible returns.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nBai Yingying straightened up.\n\nA frigid aura suddenly emanated from her.\n\nThe silly girl instantly transformed into an ice queen.\n\nXu Qinglang, still wallowing in self-pity, suddenly trembled.\n\nThe familiar shiver from their first meeting washed over him again. Almost instinctively, Xu Qinglang once more became a timid little quail.\n\n\"Who did you say you were going to take as a maid?\" the female corpse asked.\n\n\"Nothing. I said I was going to buy a new graphics card for you this afternoon so you can play 'Chicken Dinner'¹ on the highest graphics settings.\"\n\n***\n\n\"Here, this is the file on the Lady in Green.\"\n\nTang Shi handed a tablet to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's hair was still damp. Leaning against the wall on the bamboo mat, he looked like a handsome, languid-type college student who had just finished playing basketball and taken a shower.\n\nXu Le had all sorts of flaws and was a good-for-nothing in many ways,\n\nbut you couldn't deny that Xu Le was very good-looking.\n\nOtherwise, the Lin family's parents wouldn't have chosen him to be their live-in son-in-law.\n\n\"Praying for children?\" Zhou Ze asked after glancing at the file on the Lady in Green.\n\nThe Lady in Green was a minor local temple in Tongcheng. She doesn't exist in historical records, nor does she have a place in the mainstream mythological pantheon. Even in Tongcheng, she wasn't exactly a household name.\n\nHer story wasn't widely known, and most of the tales about her were just made up by later generations.\n\nIt's like how many attractions at Slender West Lake in Yangzhou are linked to the Qianlong Emperor's southern tours, as if the emperor did nothing else during his trips but constantly get involved in various incidents to give these places their names.\n\nThe story of the Lady in Green is also a bit absurd. There's a town in Tongcheng called Lüsi, supposedly named because Lü Dongbin visited it four times. This Lady in Green was a widow Lü Dongbin met on one of his visits to Tongcheng.\n\nThe widow was childless and refused to remarry, remaining chaste for her deceased husband. She loved children and was kind-hearted, so she took in many orphans, essentially running an ancient orphanage and nursery. When Lü Dongbin discovered her, he gave her a long green robe as a sign of encouragement.\n\nAfter she died, the local people built a temple to commemorate her good deeds, calling it the Temple of the Lady in Green.\n\nMost people who came to this temple to burn incense were praying for children to continue their family line, similar to the Bodhisattva Guanyin, the bestower of children.\n\nHowever, the file noted at the bottom that during the old city district's renovation, the Temple of the Lady in Green had been torn down.\n\nRebuilding it would be difficult. Firstly, she wasn't as famous as Mazu. Secondly, the difficulty of building a new temple is genuinely high, and the developers weren't about to create more work for themselves. Although some local elders protested, the temple was torn down in the end.\n\nThe file contained a photo from a few years ago. In it, the Temple of the Lady in Green was already dilapidated. The statue's head had fallen off some year prior, leaving only a headless sculpture standing there.\n\nThis did match the image of that headless woman.\n\n\"A so-called 'temple deity' is a soul-form molded from faith and incense,\" Tang Shi explained. \"Just like the Faceless Woman who came to test you. She was formed from the grievances of the deceased on the Road to the Underworld.\"\n\n\"So she knew her temple was about to be torn down and that she was about to disappear, so she came out to kill people to vent her anger?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Temple deities have their own codes of conduct. Even in a final frenzy, they would never act without reason.\"\n\n\"I know that, I looked it up.\" Xu Qinglang came up the stairs just then. \"The girl whose head was cut off by the ceiling fan had three abortions at the hospital. The Lady in Green was deliberately carrying out a final punishment according to her own code of conduct.\"\n\n\"Punishment?\" Zhou Ze shot back. \"Who gave her the authority to do that?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shrugged. \"Everyone has a different perspective, so naturally their stance is different too. In her eyes, a child is a life. Having an abortion for no good reason, an irresponsible abortion, is a desecration of life itself.\"\n\n\"So, if I hadn't happened to run into her, she was planning to keep finding people like that and making them die in 'accidents'?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"That's likely the case,\" Tang Shi nodded. \"She's already gone mad and become obsessed. Anyone, when pushed to the end of their rope, will become frantic. Even a temple deity.\"\n\n\"I've been wondering something. Why did she only kill the woman? Old Zhou, do you remember the girl's boyfriend from the noodle shop? How come nothing happened to him? Is the Lady in Green sexist too?\"\n\n\"That's why the student boyfriend is the most pitiful one,\" Zhou Ze gave his answer.\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment upon hearing this, then a look of sudden realization crossed his face. He said:\n\n\"When will my thinking ever be as sharp as yours?\"\n\n\"Anyway, you could stand to slow down a bit next time,\" Tang Shi reminded him. \"Desperados, especially temple deities like this, don't mess with them next time. Whatever she does, she has her past merits to offset it. It's not your failure of duty.\"\n\n\"It's not a question of whether I want to get involved. I just happened to run into it, and…\"\n\nAfter a moment's thought, Zhou Ze recalled the monkey from before and instantly lost the enthusiasm to explain. He just waved his hand. \"Forget it. Let's drop it.\"\n\nBut Tang Shi just smiled sweetly and said, \"I originally thought you were different from him. Now I suddenly realize that, in essence, you're both the same.\"\n\n\"I have no desire to follow his path. By the way, are your injuries healed?\"\n\n\"More or less.\"\n\n\"Then what are you still doing here? Aren't you going to help that friend of yours? I can book you a flight to Rongcheng.\"\n\n\"Whether I go or not doesn't really matter anymore. The outcome won't change just because I'm there. Besides, I believe he can make it back.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was about to leave when he suddenly remembered something. He said, \"Oh, right, everything with the new shop is sorted out. You can move in anytime.\"\n\n\"Let's wait until I've recovered a bit more,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nHe had no desire to oversee the shop's business from a wheelchair.\n\n\"Alright then. You take care of yourself. Be careful not to get your wounds wet.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went downstairs.\n\nTang Shi was still standing there. With a flick of her finger, a White Rabbit creamy candy unwrapped itself and flew into her mouth.\n\nShe chewed on it as she asked Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Something about you seems to have changed.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"But I still have to remind you to take good care of this body. For people like us, coming back from Hell, we only get one chance to choose a body. Once this one is ruined, you'll become a lonely, wandering ghost.\"\n\n\"No exceptions?\" Zhou Ze frowned. He wasn't particularly fond of this body. Although he'd gotten used to it, there were still some... unspoken difficulties.\n\nEspecially when facing Doctor Lin.\n\nTang Shi thought for a moment and said, \"*That person* seems to have the ability to change bodies, but he's a special case. For the rest of us, there's only one single chance.\"\n\n\"You seem to be in a good mood today,\" Zhou Ze noted, noticing that Tang Shi was a bit more talkative than usual.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't narcissistic enough to think the woman was so happy about his safe return that she'd become chatty.\n\n\"He sent a message. By the end of the month, there'll be a result.\"\n\n\"Oh, so the waiting wife² has received news and is overjoyed.\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched languidly. \"I hope he has a burst of cosmic power over there, kills that whole gang of hell bailiffs, Faceless Women, and what have you. Even if he has to self-destruct in the end, as long as he takes them down with him. That way, I can go back to living my own quiet little life in peace.\"\n\nThe little loli and the Faceless Woman were like the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head.\n\n\"After things over there are settled, he might come here too. When that happens, you two might even become neighbors.\"\n\n*Heh. Women.*\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze didn't have much confidence that *that person* would return safely from Rongcheng. But he also knew that, for the Tang Shi in front of him, she was past the point of listening to any rational words.\n\nZhou Ze could only play along and continue:\n\n\"Alright then, we could even form a group. Marvel has *The Avengers*, don't they? We could have one too. The *League of Visitors from Hell*? Or the *League of Hellions*?\"\n\n\"Too obviously a rip-off. It's tacky,\" Tang Shi said, clearly unimpressed with the names.\n\n\"Hah. You suggest one, then.\"\n\n\"How about... *The Anorexics' Alliance*?\"\n\n***\n¹ \"Chicken Dinner\" (吃鸡) is slang for the battle royale game *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)*, derived from its victory message, \"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner.\"\n\n² \"Waiting wife\" (望夫石) refers to a Chinese folktale about a woman who waited so long for her husband's return that she turned to stone. It's a metaphor for a loyal, pining wife.",

    "content": "In a week, both Xu Qinglang's noodle shop and Zhou Ze's bookstore would be moving to their new locations tomorrow. Tonight, however, Xu Qinglang still opened the noodle shop, saying he planned to do one last day of business here.\n\nIt’s hard to leave one's homeland. This noodle shop held a long stretch of Xu Qinglang's life, including the last moments he had spent with his parents.\n\nIf not for the little loli's intervention, perhaps Xu Qinglang could still be \"dining\" with his parents every night, enjoying the warmth of a family together.\n\nZhou Ze's bookstore, on the other hand, had already closed. The books were all packed in boxes, just waiting for the truck to come and haul them away tomorrow.\n\nWith Bai Yingying, a laborer as strong as an ox, and Tang Shi, an \"object controller,\" the efficiency of packing was indeed quite high. Boss Zhou, whose injuries were mostly but not completely healed, only needed to hold a teapot and sit in the noodle shop next door, sipping tea, looking for all the world like an old-time landlord.\n\nLao Dao and the monkey were playing in the empty shopping mall out back. The monkey was very fond of Lao Dao, and the man and primate were having a good time together.\n\nThere was no forest here, but the deserted commercial center behind them was more than enough for the monkey to gallop and frolic about.\n\nSipping his tea and watching the sun gradually set outside, Xu Qinglang sat looking at his phone. He didn't show much sadness, though of course, there wasn't much joy to be seen either.\n\nFortunately, at this moment, a customer finally arrived.\n\nThis was the first customer of the day.\n\nAs expected,\n\nthis would also be the last customer of the day.\n\nEver since the last time, when Zhou Ze had hailed a cab and asked the driver to take him somewhere \"unclean,\"¹ only for the driver to bring him here, whatever little foot traffic remained had long since vanished completely.\n\nPeople who used to pass by on their way to or from work now chose to take a detour.\n\nThis was also the reason Zhou Ze had decided to move.\n\nThe newcomer wore a suit, but his hair was disheveled and the suit itself was a bit dirty. He looked less like an office worker and more like a vagrant, yet the suit itself was clearly expensive.\n\n\"What'll you have?\" Xu Qinglang asked, getting up.\n\n\"A few of your specialty dishes and a bottle of Snow Beer. Iced.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nXu Qinglang first brought him the beer, then went into the kitchen to cook.\n\nThe man sat directly across from Zhou Ze, separated by an aisle.\n\nHe glanced around the noodle shop and said:\n\n\"Moving, are we?\"\n\n\"Is it that obvious?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\n\"Yeah. The place has just been cleaned. In a place where birds don't even shit, who'd bother cleaning so meticulously? It's obvious you're getting ready to leave.\"\n\nThe man took out a cigarette, lit it, and then flicked the ash directly onto the dining table.\n\nA moment later, Xu Qinglang came over with the first dish. The man looked at its presentation, shook his head, and said:\n\n\"Boss, your cooking really isn't as good-looking as you are.\"\n\n\"Just eat your food,\" Xu Qinglang replied, neither warmly nor coldly.\n\nThis was the kind of temper a man with over twenty properties had when doing business.\n\nThe man picked up his chopsticks, took a bite, then spat it out. \"This was made without any heart. It's not authentic.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had already returned to the kitchen to cook the next dish, so he didn't hear the man's mumbling.\n\n\"I think his cooking is pretty good,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Pretty good?\" The man lightly tapped the table. \"Someone just dabbling in cooking as a hobby, and you call that 'pretty good'?\"\n\nWith that, the man used his teeth to pry open the beer cap and took a long swig. \"I can tell. He's clearly not short on cash, just cooking to experience life. There's no sincerity in this food at all.\"\n\n\"It's hard to find a sincere restaurant these days.\"\n\n\"Whoa, what's the deal with you two? I say his food's bad, and suddenly you're targeting me?\"\n\nThe man pointed at Zhou Ze, then gestured toward the kitchen and smiled silently.\n\n\"Oho, something fishy's going on. Definitely something fishy.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered with this guy. The only reason he had struck up a conversation was that the man looked a bit familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before.\n\nOf course, that must have been in his past life.\n\n\"Disgusted? Think I'm a disgusting person? Disgusting people live more comfortable lives. I bet your life isn't all that comfortable. Sitting there with your tea, looking all zen and proper, but you're just another busybody.\n\n\"People, you see, as long as they like to meddle in others' business, they can never live a comfortable life.\"\n\nThe man took another drink of beer, smiling at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"By the way, the bookstore next door, that's yours, right? Closing down too?\" the man asked, pointing next door. \"When I came over, I saw everything inside the glass door was packed up.\"\n\n\"Yes, we're moving.\"\n\n\"Have you sued?\" the man asked, his eyes narrowed.\n\n\"Sued who?\"\n\n\"Sue the developers here! Sue the management! I heard there's been one incident after another here; it's clearly the management's negligence.\n\n\"A fire in the cinema,\n\n\"then someone jumping off the roof to commit suicide.\n\n\"That's what drove your businesses under. Sue them! Make them compensate you for your losses!\"\n\n\"Sue for what? Business was already bad before.\" Xu Qinglang came out carrying the last dish and placed the rice on the table. He said to the man, \"Eighty yuan.\"\n\n\"Tch, you're asking me for eighty yuan when I'm telling you about a big payday. That cinema fire—you can sue the cinema! Make them pay for your losses.\"\n\n\"That was arson. The arsonist was a penniless bum, he can't pay anything,\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n\"Bullshit. Isn't the cinema responsible for a fire in their theater?\n\n\"Isn't the management here responsible?\n\n\"Sue them! Sue them for your losses! And those two who jumped, I heard their families are quite rich. Sue them! They jumped here, affecting your normal business operations. Make them pay for the damages!\"\n\n\"That's quite a novel theory,\" Zhou Ze said, bemused.\n\nNever mind that he and Xu Qinglang, due to their special identities, had no intention of seeking damages; even if they were normal people, they probably would have never thought of trying to get compensation for this.\n\n\"What's novel about it? If there's a law, use it! You Chinese people, you just don't like to sue. But let me tell you, you can win this case. You'll get compensation.\n\n\"Even pulling a single hair from that cinema corporation is thicker than our waists.\n\n\"I can help you with the lawsuit. I happen to be short on cash. No lawyer's fees upfront; we'll split the compensation fifty-fifty. Don't worry, it won't be a small amount. I wouldn't take a case for chump change.\"\n\n\"Go away, who has the time to file a lawsuit with you? Besides, their families lost someone, and we're supposed to go after them for damages and compensation? Is that decent?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was starting to get annoyed with this guy.\n\n\"What's the use of being decent? Does being decent get you money? You were decent, and your business still failed and now you have to move, right?\"\n\nThe man drank again. The bottle of beer was already nearly empty.\n\n\"Why turn down money when it's right there? Are you stupid?!\"\n\n\"Is your surname Du?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\nThe man froze, then looked at Zhou Ze. \"Well, what do you know. You actually recognize me.\"\n\n\"Old Zhou, you know him?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"A great lawyer.\"\n\n\"Him? A great lawyer?\" Xu Qinglang laughed so hard tears almost came out. \"He's clearly a shyster.\"\n\n\"He really is a great lawyer,\" Zhou Ze repeated.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that the hospital where he used to work had two medical malpractice incidents caused by a new drug. The patients took them to court, and the hospital hired this great Lawyer Du, who won the case perfectly.\n\nHe was from Tongcheng, but he used to have his own law firm in Shanghai. He was a well-known professional lawyer in the industry with a very high success rate.\n\nHowever, his price back then was exorbitant. Other than tycoons and large corporations, ordinary people simply couldn't afford his fees.\n\n\"Since you recognize me, you should know how good I am at winning cases. Come on, hire me. You'll get money for your new shops, and I need the cash.\"\n\nThe great Lawyer Du looked at Zhou Ze, his expression clearly saying, \"Hurry up and beg me.\"\n\n\"Sorry, we're not interested,\" Zhou Ze refused again.\n\n\"Not interested in Renminbi? Are you interested in Hell Money instead?\"²\n\nThe great Lawyer Du clutched his stomach and laughed.\n\nThen he stood up,\n\nand pointed a finger at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Turning down free money. A couple of big idiots.\"\n\nWith that, he felt around in his pockets, took out a hundred-yuan bill, and placed it on the table.\n\n\"The food was terrible. Keep the change.\"\n\nThen, holding the remaining half-bottle of beer, he staggered out of the shop.\n\n\"Is that guy nuts?\" Xu Qinglang said as he cleared the table. \"Whatever, I'm closing up. From now on, it's just coffee and pastries.\"\n\n\"He was very capable. Before,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You think so highly of him?\"\n\n\"It's not about thinking highly. In any profession, to be top-tier in a region, especially somewhere like Shanghai, you have to be a truly capable person.\n\n\"Do you know his most famous case?\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"A juvenile home invasion and murder case. Even though the prosecution had a mountain of evidence, the suspect's family paid a fortune to hire him as the defense lawyer.\n\n\"In the end, he actually won the case. The suspect was acquitted.\"\n\n\"So did the kid actually kill someone or not?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"He probably did.\"\n\n\"How can someone so money-grubbing still survive in the industry?\"\n\n\"They only do better. Because what tycoons and large corporations need are lawyers who can win cases and protect their interests, not lawyers who only talk about conscience.\"\n\n\"I get that logic.\" Xu Qinglang stretched, then pointed curiously at the figure staggering away in the distance, drinking as he went. \"Then how did that guy end up in such a sorry state, even coming here to try and drum up a lawsuit from us?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of tea.\n\nHe said slowly:\n\n\"Later, the minor who was acquitted committed another murder during a home invasion.\n\n\"By a twist of fate,\n\n\"the house he broke into,\n\n\"belonged to our great Lawyer Du.\n\n\"His wife and daughter, on that day,\n\n\"were killed.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"Unclean place\" (不乾淨的地方) is a common euphemism in Chinese for a haunted or unlucky location.\n² Renminbi is the official currency of China.

    "content": "The new store's grand opening was a joyous occasion.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, the costs of renovation, rent, and everything else you could think of for the new store hadn't actually come out of his own pocket.\n\nXu Qinglang had paid for half, and the other half came from money exchanged for Bai Yingying's burial goods.\n\nOf course, Xu Qinglang was now planning to \"semi-retire,\" intending only to sell coffee and make small snacks in the bookstore, embracing a life of leisure and wellness.\n\nThe matter of making money would have to fall to Zhou Ze.\n\nFortunately, no one really doubted Zhou Ze's ability to earn money. The new store was located on South Avenue, a spot with heavy foot traffic, which probably meant a lot of ghost traffic too.\n\nAs long as Boss Zhou embodied the professional spirit of being unafraid of hardship and sleepless nights, constantly sending these ghosts who showed up at his door to Hell for re-education and a new start, making heaps of underworld currency shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThen, everyone could just squat by the bookstore entrance, burn the paper money, and wait for people to drop their wallets. It would even save them the service fees at the bank.\n\nThe bookstore's overall color scheme was a soft, dark tone. The bookshelves inside weren't packed too densely. Newspapers and magazines, which were updated more frequently, had their own shelf; novels had another; and other, more serious books were in a separate section.\n\nAs for things like study aids, Zhou Ze didn't bother stocking them this time.\n\nThe bookstore had a second floor, which was partitioned into three rooms and a bathroom, serving as everyone's living quarters.\n\nOn the first day of business, there were no firecrackers, no flower baskets or celebratory cannons. Everything was simple and calm.\n\nThe old Taoist tactfully helped Bai Yingying with the cleaning, while Zhou Ze sat behind the bar, savoring a cocktail Xu Qinglang had just mixed.\n\nHe took a sip and set the glass down. The little monkey picked it up, stole a sip, and found it so disgusting that it stuck its tongue out repeatedly.\n\nTang Shi was alone in her bedroom upstairs. She was a homebody; if there was nothing to do, she could stay in her room all day without getting bored.\n\nBy the time everything was tidied up and they were truly ready to welcome customers, it was already after dusk, and the sky had grown dim.\n\nBai Yingying lifted the sign with one hand, hung up the \"Midnight Bookstore\" plaque, then jumped down. She clapped her hands together, satisfied after confirming it was perfectly straight.\n\nThen, as the boss had instructed, she also hung the two couplet plaques, \"Take It With a Grain of Salt\"¹ and \"Thus Have I Heard\"², on the left and right sides, securing them in place.\n\nThese were the signs brought over from the old store.\n\nBai Yingying had asked Zhou Ze what \"Take It With a Grain of Salt\" and \"Thus Have I Heard\" meant. Zhou Ze explained that it simply meant he was telling stories he'd heard for others to listen to. They didn't represent his personal views, and people should just listen for fun and not take them seriously.\n\nThe bookstore's main business was still with the dead; the living were just a bonus. After all, not far from South Avenue was \"Tongcheng Bookstore,\" a large bookstore specializing in physical books. Competing with it would be incredibly difficult, and besides, there was no need.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that in his childhood, \"Tongcheng Bookstore\" was considered the most influential bookstore in the hearts of Tongcheng's people. But in recent years, with the constant shrinking and decline of the physical book market, Tongcheng Bookstore had also reduced its business area, looking quite shabby compared to its heyday.\n\nOne could only say that the popularization of smartphones and screen reading had slowly made most people forget the habit of reading from fragrant, ink-printed paper.\n\nEverything was done, things were on track, and all that was left was to wait for business to arrive.\n\nIn fact, business came quickly. From the official opening at 7 p.m. until now, several groups of customers had already come in, but they were all living people who ordered a coffee or another drink to rest and chat.\n\nWhen the living came, Zhou Ze didn't even bother to move. Xu Qinglang, on the other hand, had to constantly attend to them and mix drinks, busy as could be.\n\nIt was already 9:30 by the time he saw off the last of these groups. Xu Qinglang took a sip of water, and looking at Zhou Ze rocking back and forth in his rocking chair, he felt a great sense of injustice!\n\n\"Old Zhou, I think we should hang a sign: 'No Living Allowed.' What do you think?\"\n\n\"And then the Bureau of Industry and Commerce will show up at our door the next day.\" Zhou Ze rejected Xu Qinglang's proposal without a second thought.\n\n\"But I feel like this is even more tiring than when I ran the noodle shop,\" Xu Qinglang said with a mournful expression.\n\nWhen he ran the noodle shop before, not many people actually came to the restaurant to eat; most orders were from delivery apps. Whenever he wanted a break, he could just turn off the delivery app. But now, when a customer walked in, you couldn't just push them back out, could you?\n\n\"See? Here comes one now.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked outside the door.\n\nIt seemed it really was due to the location; today's real business had also come quickly.\n\nEntering was an old woman, leaning on a cane. Her body was gaunt and somewhat wizened, and her eyes were wide open, as if she had died with a grievance.\n\nThe old woman carried a faint air of resentment, which meant she still had some lingering attachments, which was why she hadn't gone to Hell or entered the cycle of reincarnation.\n\nBut this bit of resentment was far from enough to turn her into a vengeful ghost; she was still in the \"harmless to humans and animals\" category.\n\n\"Prep the food,\" Zhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang.\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang didn't complain about being tired. In fact, preparing a meal for those about to be sent to Hell was his own suggestion.\n\nHe felt that Zhou Ze's previous method of sending ghosts directly to Hell was too simple and crude, lacking any foreplay. It was too blunt and lacked quality service.\n\nThus, he proposed preparing a meal before sending people to Hell, to give them a proper send-off. That way, they might leave behind a bit more underworld currency.\n\nIt was the same principle as a movie theater's main income coming from tickets, but also having a large income from selling Coke and popcorn.\n\nThe meal was also very simple: a plate of dried radish, a plate of peanuts, a bowl of rice with chopsticks stuck upright in it, and a cup of old rice wine.\n\nThey were all things prepared in advance, just needing to be plated, so it wasn't much trouble.\n\nThe old Taoist set up a small table and a small stool, and even pulled a curtain to block the view from outside. Otherwise, if another customer came in and saw this, they'd probably be scared half to death.\n\nThis was a sort of small private room, one specially prepared for ghosts.\n\n\"Please,\" Zhou Ze said to the old woman as he walked over, teacup in hand.\n\nThe old woman was a bit hesitant. You could see she was afraid, but she was even more terrified of Zhou Ze. So, she could only sit down, trembling.\n\nXu Qinglang handed a bottle of bull's tears mixed with talisman water to the old Taoist. The old Taoist wiped it on his eyes and was able to see the old woman.\n\nTo be honest, the old Taoist hadn't encountered this kind of ghost-welcoming business since he left the Underworld Store. For a moment, he felt a bit wistful, his thoughts drifting to his old boss who was still in Rongcheng.\n\nBut it would be soon.\n\nThe old Taoist had already sent a notification to his followers in his livestreaming room, which had been inactive for months, announcing that he would resume streaming in the early morning of April 1st, specifically, just after 12:20 AM on March 31st.\n\nThat was the day his boss had said he would return.\n\nBai Yingying also brought over a small stool and sat down. The old woman looked a bit shy. A zombie, an underworld emissary, a mystic practitioner, plus an old Taoist who seemed to have steam rising from his crotch...\n\nThe old woman felt an immense amount of pressure.\n\nHer tiny bit of resentment was truly nothing in the face of this pack of wolves.\n\n\"Eat up. When you're done, it'll be time to go on your way,\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nThe old woman gave a small smile, lowered her head, and began to eat.\n\nIt was like how a tiger is terrifying, but when facing its keeper in a zoo, it's just like a little kitty.\n\nIf this old woman were outside and someone caught a fleeting glimpse of her, she could probably scare them sick or make them faint, but right now, she could only eat obediently.\n\n\"Ma'am, how'd you die?\" the old Taoist began to ask.\n\nThe old Taoist was an active person. Even at his age, the older he got, the more he talked.\n\nHe would usually chat with the little monkey, telling tales of how five hundred years ago he subdued demons and monsters, suppressing a great, boisterous monkey under Five Finger Mountain, and so on.\n\nThe monkey would play along, too. As long as the old Taoist bought it some snacks, the monkey could sit there and listen to him brag for an entire afternoon, occasionally waving its hand in approval:\n\n\"Well said!\"\n\n\"San peng si li.\"\n\nThe old Taoist was completely lost. He knew the old woman was speaking in a dialect, so he looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"She died of illness,\" Zhou Ze translated.\n\nThe Tongcheng dialect is very different from Mandarin.\n\n\"Ma'am, that's no good. Even as a ghost, you can't stop learning! You have to learn Mandarin, too. Otherwise, when you get to Hell... think about it, there are so many people on the Yellow Springs Road, it'll be hard to find someone who speaks the Tongcheng dialect. You won't even have anyone to chat with on the way. How boring would that be?\" the old Taoist kindly advised.\n\nThe woman looked a bit embarrassed and could only lower her head and eat.\n\n\"Do you have any children?\" the old Taoist asked again.\n\n\"Yu guo o te.\"\n\nThe old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze again, as if to say, *Hurry up and translate*.\n\n\"She has a daughter,\" Xu Qinglang translated this time.\n\n\"Then your daughter must have burned a lot of paper money for you, right?\" The old Taoist rubbed his hands together.\n\nHearing this, the old woman paused, then said with a bitter smile, \"Our family doesn't have much money.\" (Translated by Xu Qinglang)\n\n\"Don't have much money?\" The old Taoist wasn't discouraged. \"That's fine. Paper money isn't expensive anyway. As long as your child keeps you in her heart, you'll get more.\"\n\n\"She's lying in a hospital bed, no money for treatment.\" (Translated by Xu Qinglang). As the old woman said this, she put down her chopsticks and wiped away her tears.\n\n\"How pitiful.\" The old Taoist wiped away his own tears along with her.\n\nBai Yingying pouted, her heart aching a little as well.\n\n\"My daughter, at my hospital bedside, asked me if I wanted to keep spending money on treatment. I was lying in bed, unable to speak or move. She cried and said to me, if I didn't want to continue treatment, I should just blink once. If I didn't blink, she would keep treating me even if she had to sell the pot and melt the iron to do it.\"\n\n\"That's a good daughter,\" said the old Taoist. \"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I blinked. Then I went home from the hospital, and then I died.\" The old woman continued to wipe her tears.\n\n\"It's not easy. You were thinking of your children, that's truly noble. It's not easy for anyone, children have to live their lives too.\" The old Taoist grieved along with her.\n\nIn fact, things like this happen often in real life, especially when facing terminal illnesses that require a constant infusion of money, which many families simply cannot afford.\n\nBai Yingying: \"Ma'am, you're very noble.\"\n\nXu Qinglang: \"Let me pour you another cup of wine.\"\n\nMeanwhile, watching everyone around him with tear-filled eyes, Zhou Ze didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nHe pointed at the old woman's eyes, which had been wide open in a deathly stare ever since she walked in, and asked:\n\n\"How did you blink?\"\n\nHearing this,\n\nthe old woman stopped crying,\n\nand immediately said viciously:\n\n\"She asked me,\n\n*Ma, I'm asking you, if you don't want to continue treatment, just blink. If you don't blink, I'll keep treating you even if I have to sell the pot and melt the iron.*\n\nThen,\n\nafter waiting for five minutes,\n\nI really couldn't hold it anymore,\n\nand I blinked.\n\nShe immediately started wiping her tears and said:\n\n*Okay,*\n\n*Ma,*\n\n*I know what you mean.*\n\n*We'll stop the treatment.*\"\n\n---\n¹ Original: 姑妄聽之 (gū wàng tīng zhī), a phrase meaning to listen to something skeptically or just for the sake of hearing it.\n² Original: 如是我聞 (rú shì wǒ wén), the classic opening phrase of Buddhist sutras, meaning \"Thus have I heard.\"",

    "content": "After Xu Qinglang translated the old woman's final words, the crowd, which had been so moved just moments before, was left utterly baffled.\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nWhere's the feel-good chicken soup story about \"I live for my children, and my children live for me,\" the loving mother and her filial children?\n\nWhy did there have to be a twist like that?\n\nZhou Ze clapped his hands and asked, \"Finished eating?\"\n\nThe subtext was, *if you're done eating, it's time to go.*\n\nThe old woman sheepishly put down her chopsticks.\n\n\"I don't know how I ended up here,\" she said. \"I don't want to go down yet. I still want to...\"\n\nZhou Ze watched her in silence, a faint smile appearing on his lips.\n\nThe customer comes first.\n\nA customer's requests must be heard with a smile.\n\nThe old woman's body stiffened, and she shuddered in fear.\n\nShe said quickly,\n\n\"You know, I think it's better if I go down sooner rather than later.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought he should put up a few slogans in this little private room:\n\n*Leniency for confessions, severity for resistance.*\n\nMaybe that was a bit too serious. Or perhaps:\n\n*Undergo reform with diligence, turn over a new leaf.*\n\nThese thoughts could only make him chuckle to himself. Zhou Ze stood up and opened the Gate of Hell. The old woman was still hesitating, but Zhou Ze simply grabbed her by the shoulder and tossed her in.\n\nAnd just like that,\n\nthe new store's first transaction was complete.\n\nNext, Zhou Ze bent down and looked under the small table, where he saw a small stack of hell money.\n\n\"Count it. Is it more than before?\" Xu Qinglang urged.\n\n\"Seems like it's a little more,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"That means this method works. I told you, the biggest profit margins are in value-added services. Shouldn't we come up with some other services?\"\n\nEven though he owned over twenty properties, Xu Qinglang's desire to make money was as strong as ever.\n\nNo one ever complains about having too much money.\n\n\"Offer a massage? Or a spa?\" Zhou Ze laughed.\n\n\"Isn't that going too far?\" Xu Qinglang frowned.\n\n\"Some funeral homes offer that kind of service now, giving hydrotherapy massages to the dead. I've seen it before. It's in a glass-walled room where the family stands outside watching while a technician inside gives the corpse a bath and a massage, with nail trimming included as part of the package.\"\n\n\"You're disgusting.\" Xu Qinglang shot him a look that said *I can't deal with you*, then turned to start clearing the dishes from the table.\n\nIn truth, none of the food had been touched, or at least it looked that way, but it still had to be thrown out.\n\nIf it were food or fruit offered by a family to their own ancestors, it would be fine for the living to eat it afterward. After all, it's something your own ancestors have eaten; there's nothing wrong with sharing a dish at the same table.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang had no relation to the old woman, so of course, he wasn't going to eat her leftovers.\n\nAfter putting the hell money in the cabinet, Zhou Ze sat back down in his rocking chair.\n\nRocking forward,\n\nrocking back.\n\nHe liked this feeling of contentment, enjoyed this unhurried leisure.\n\nBai Yingying had run upstairs to play on the computer, the old Daoist had taken the monkey upstairs to watch TV, and Xu Qinglang had also gone up to rest.\n\nAs a result, Zhou Ze was the only one left on the first floor of the bookstore.\n\nHe picked up his phone and browsed idly, checking the news and whatnot. Outside, it had started to rain without him noticing. The rain was quite heavy, transforming from a sparse drizzle into a torrential downpour.\n\nIt could really rain at any time during this season.\n\nHe took a sip of water from his cup. When Zhou Ze stretched and looked up again, he was surprised to see a dense row of people standing at the entrance of his bookstore.\n\nWell now,\n\nbusiness is this good today?\n\nThis was only the first night since the new store opened. If it was always going to be like this, Zhou Ze figured he could not only pay back the money he owed his maid quickly, but also buy a nice car right away.\n\nHmm, except that good-for-nothing Xu Le didn't even have a driver's license. I'd have to go get one myself.\n\nHe walked to the entrance and froze. What stood outside wasn't people, but rows of clothes.\n\nThe street vendors who sold clothes outside had moved their racks under his awning to get out of the rain. His own preconceived notions had made him mistake them for a crowd of ghostly figures.\n\nHe opened the store door.\n\nStanding outside were two young women, probably in their early twenties. Both had money pouches clipped to their waists and their hair tied in ponytails, looking crisp and capable.\n\n\"Sorry, boss, we're blocking your business. We'll leave as soon as the rain lets up. We're really sorry,\" one of the girls said, bowing to Zhou Ze in apology.\n\n\"Boss, do you have coffee? We can buy two cups,\" the other girl, a quicker thinker, suggested. If they bought something, he'd be less likely to kick them out.\n\n\"It's fine. Wait until the rain stops.\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't that unreasonable. Besides, his line of work involved customers who could get in even if a steel plate was blocking the door.\n\n\"Thank you, boss.\"\n\n\"Thank you, boss.\"\n\nThe two girls thanked Zhou Ze again.\n\nZhou Ze went back behind his bar. The upgraded bar was indeed much more high-end and comfortable than the old counter. The surround sound system was on, playing soft music.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, the rain showed no signs of letting up. One of the girls pushed open the bookstore door and came inside. It was one of the two young women who sold clothes.\n\nThe girl walked to a bookshelf, picked out a few fashion magazines, and then came to Zhou Ze to pay.\n\n\"Forty-eight,\" Zhou Ze said after a glance at the price. \"Just give me fifty. No need for change.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe girl agreed and handed Zhou Ze a fifty-yuan bill.\n\nZhou Ze took the money.\n\nAfter a moment,\n\nthe girl froze.\n\nWait a minute, she thought,\n\nsomething's not right here.\n\nZhou Ze continued to lean back in his chair. The girl didn't dwell on the two yuan and took her books to a small sofa in the store.\n\nHer friend was outside watching their stall while she took out a blank notebook and began sketching the clothes from the magazine.\n\nZhou Ze got up, poured her a glass of orange juice, and brought it over.\n\n\"It's on the house,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, boss.\"\n\n\"Studying design?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yeah, we're students at Tongcheng University.\"\n\n\"College students running a stall to do business, that's pretty good.\"\n\nZhou Ze offered a few words of praise. He wasn't some creepy old uncle with ulterior motives, so he didn't chat any further. But as he walked toward the door, Zhou Ze suddenly saw the girl who had stayed outside to watch the clothes talking to a man dressed all in black.\n\nSeveral other people stood behind the man in black. They looked cold, shivering in the rain, but even so, they didn't know enough to move closer and take shelter under the eaves.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the door open and walked over.\n\nThe man in black looked up, saw Zhou Ze, and then immediately looked down again.\n\nThe thinly-clothed people behind him became timid and shrank back, not daring to meet Zhou Ze's gaze at all.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to the man in black. He was wearing a hat that hid half his face. Then, Zhou Ze turned his head and saw that the girl who had handed over the clothes had a dazed expression, her eyes clouded. And the money she had just received was a stack of old, worn-out hell money.\n\n\"You've gone too far,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"We are just lonely, wandering ghosts, on our way back to our hometown. It's raining, and my brothers have no clothes. We're freezing. Please, Officer, cut us some slack.\"\n\n\"If you're lonely, wandering ghosts, then hurry up and go to hell.\"\n\nZhou Ze's tone was harsh, clearly not in a mood to negotiate.\n\nA joke.\n\nLonely, wandering ghosts were still KPIs!\n\nAnd Boss Zhou was looking to boost his numbers right now. Even a mosquito's leg is still meat; he wouldn't let a single one get away.\n\nIt seemed moving the store was the right choice. Look how lively tonight was.\n\nThe man in black slowly raised his head, revealing a face covered in scars. He said in a low voice,\n\n\"So, Officer, you're not planning to discuss this nicely?\"\n\n\"What is there for me to discuss with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out, first grabbing the girl's shoulder and pulling her back slightly. Then he took a step forward, standing right in front of the man in black.\n\nHe extended a hand,\n\nand gently poked the man in black in the chest.\n\n\"You could try to spin some sob story to soften my heart.\n\nOh, wait.\n\nMy mistake, I forgot.\n\nI ate my conscience for a snack and haven't gotten around to finding it yet.\"\n\n\"After I take them back to our hometown, I will lead them back to hell. You can rest assured on that point, Officer!\"\n\nAlthough the man in black's face was a web of scars, he spoke with conviction, clearly the leader of this small group of ghosts.\n\n\"Am I supposed to buy a plane ticket and follow you to your hometown for a tour? Sorry, buddy, I don't have the time.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew long on all ten fingers.\n\nBlack mist began to swirl around them.\n\nAt that moment, the girl sitting inside the store glanced outside. All she saw was her friend and the owner seemingly chatting. She didn't see anything she wasn't supposed to.\n\n\"I can't hand them over to you now. I have to take them back first!\"\n\nThe man in black charged at Zhou Ze, full of aggression!\n\nBut in the next second,\n\nwith just a casual flick of his arm,\n\nthe man in black was sent flying, the sharpness of the nails making his very soul unstable.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze chuckled twice.\n\nAn ordinary ghost,\n\ndaring to take the initiative to attack him, a ghost emissary.\n\nThe man in black charged again, but it was no different. He was once again swatted away by Zhou Ze.\n\nThis time, the few ghosts who had been standing there trembling immediately showed signs of instability.\n\nZhou Ze had expected them to rush forward together to help their boss fight. That's what loyalty was all about.\n\nOr,\n\nmaybe the ghosts would hastily kneel and beg him for mercy.\n\nThough begging would have been useless.\n\nBut instead, they turned around and lunged at the black figure whose soul had started to blur after being struck twice by Zhou Ze.\n\nThey were furious, and they began to devour and tear at the black figure.\n\nZhou Ze stood to the side, watching the spectacle with a smile.\n\n\"Looks like your little brothers have been ruthlessly exploited by you.\"\n\nEven as he was being torn apart, the man in black didn't let out a single scream. Instead, he rebutted sternly,\n\n\"They're the criminals I was pursuing. My car and their car crashed during the chase, and we all died in the accident.\n\nBut even in death,\n\nI will drag them back to the police station at the crime scene and bring them to justice!\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze stretched out his hand, his fingertips continuously weaving strands of black qi to disperse the ghouls swarming and gnawing on the man in black. However, those wisps of black qi still clung to the little ghosts, preventing them from escaping.\n\nSince that battle on the rooftop, Zhou Ze had discovered that his mastery over this power seemed to have risen to a new level.\n\n“Are you a cop?”\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head, looking at the man in black lying on the ground, his spiritual form nearly shattered.\n\n“What do you think?”\n\nThe man in black stood up. His soul was tattered, and he looked rather miserable.\n\nBut his gaze was resolute, his eyes shining with spirit.\n\n“I just didn't expect it.”\n\nZhou Ze remembered the Director Zhao he had seen last time. On the day of his funeral procession, he had entered the bookstore, and neither Zhou Ze nor Xu Qinglang had been able to tell if he was a living person or a dead one.\n\nThinking about it, he felt a sense of acceptance.\n\nDirector Zhao was nearing retirement age and had spent the better part of his life diligently at his post, a bit like Mrs. Bai, who had descended to Hell with her merits fulfilled.\n\nPeople like that were exceptions among exceptions.\n\nIt was like learning from Lei Feng¹ and doing good deeds. It's precisely because Lei Feng is an exception in society that he needs to be studied. If everyone were a living Lei Feng, what would be the point of studying him?\n\n“Come inside with me.”\n\n***\n\nIt was still raining outside. The girl who had been sitting in the bookstore sketching a magazine went out to check on her friend and found she had fallen asleep leaning against a clothes rack. She draped a piece of clothing over her and didn't go back inside, choosing to stay outside with her.\n\nThe two female university students, out running a stall to earn money, were like delicate wildflowers in the city, stubborn and strong.\n\nFor them, this was an ordinary day: setting up their stall, encountering rain, taking shelter…\n\nThey could never know what kind of business the bookstore they were taking shelter in actually ran, nor would they remember that one of them had just nearly closed a deal with a ghost.\n\nInside the bookstore, Zhou Ze set out some peanuts and fried broad beans. The man in black sat across from him, while the little ghosts stood to the side, trembling in fear.\n\n“Thank you for your hospitality,” the man in black said in a deep voice.\n\n“Once you’re done eating, be on your way,” Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe man looked up at Zhou Ze. Clearly, he was unwilling.\n\n“They’re already dead, and you’ve already made your sacrifice. You’ve done all the duties you needed to do. There’s no need to cling to that wisp of obsession and forcibly drag them along with you.\n\n“If something goes wrong along the way and their souls escape your control, this world will have several more wandering ghosts. Who knows, they might even stir up some other kind of trouble.”\n\nZhou Ze explained patiently.\n\nIn truth, there was only one central idea.\n\nI respect you,\n\nbut respect is respect, and work is work.\n\nYou have your obsession, but I have my duties.\n\nThe living are your concern.\n\nThe dead are mine.\n\n“Then can I ask a favor of you?”\n\n“Say it first.”\n\n“Help me investigate the cause of my death.” The man in black lifted his scar-covered face, which looked exceptionally menacing at that moment. “I was working undercover. Someone sold me out. Otherwise, I would have brought them all to justice, alive.”\n\nThe man in black recalled being in the car when one of the men suddenly answered a phone call. The atmosphere instantly changed. He realized his cover was blown, and a struggle began inside the vehicle. In the end, the car plunged into a ravine, resulting in the tragedy of their deaths.\n\n“This sounds like a plot from a crime show.”\n\nAfter hearing the man’s story, Zhou Ze let out a sigh.\n\nBeing an undercover cop really wasn’t easy.\n\n“Here, a toast to you.”\n\nZhou Ze raised his wine cup and gestured towards him.\n\nThen, he set the cup down.\n\n“You’ve agreed?” the man asked.\n\n“No, I was just stalling to figure out how to refuse without making it awkward for both of us.”\n\n“...” said the man in black.\n\n“I’m sorry, I can’t do it. This is just a bookstore, which is really just a waystation for sending souls who shouldn't linger in the mortal world to Hell for reincarnation.\n\n“The affairs of the living are not my business, nor could I possibly get involved. The most I can do is send an anonymous letter for you. Anything more than that, I can’t and won’t do.”\n\nThe man in black looked disappointed. He seemed to want to say more, but it turned into a sigh, and he drank the cup of wine.\n\nWhen a ghost drinks, it only absorbs the alcohol’s essence; the liquid in the cup appears untouched. Zhou Ze helped him pour out the original wine and refilled the cup.\n\n“Have two more cups, and then I’ll send you on your way. I wish you a safe journey.”\n\nWhen a person is about to die, their words are kind.\n\nBesides, the ghost before him was about to be sent to Hell by him. At this point, there was no need for the man to spin tales to deceive him.\n\nThis was a good cop.\n\nWorthy of three cups.\n\nZhou Ze gestured to the wine cup.\n\nThis was all he could do.\n\nIn this world, turmoil, injustice, and tragedies occurred every moment. Zhou Ze couldn't manage so much, nor did he want to.\n\nRunning this bookstore well and getting his second life on the right track was what he was focused on now.\n\n“In Hell, there is judgment, right?” the man in black asked Zhou Ze.\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze paused.\n\nHe suddenly thought of that teacher wearing the tall hat with the words “Beast in Human Clothing” written on it.\n\nZhou Ze had once tried to take that hat off for him but couldn’t do it at all. The hat was as hard as iron, completely immovable.\n\nThis also meant that the Halls of Yama in Hell weren't necessarily the fabled place where right and wrong were clearly distinguished. Those judges weren’t all sharp-eyed and all-seeing, either.\n\nMost of them probably just muddled through their days, getting by.\n\nPeople always hold a strange sort of expectation for things they don't understand.\n\nLike Heaven.\n\nLike Hell.\n\nPeople always believe that in places they’ve never been, more beautiful flowers bloom.\n\nThis was a kind of spiritual anesthetic, a form of self-hypnosis.\n\nAt least from what he had seen so far,\n\nHell,\n\nseemed to be no different from the mortal world.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still nodded.\n\n“Yes. Everything will come to light in Hell.”\n\nThe man in black stood up, looked at Zhou Ze, and said, “I don’t want you to send an anonymous letter for me. Just help me find our bodies. If you consider yourself a ghost messenger, I’m begging you. If you consider yourself a living person, then as a citizen, you have an obligation to cooperate with our police operations.”\n\nThe man stated a place name.\n\nQiming Road, Huangjia Town section.\n\n“Your bodies haven’t been found yet?” Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\n“No, not yet. That’s why I haven’t been exonerated. Except for my handler who knew my identity, everyone else thinks I’ve absconded with this gang.”\n\n“I’ll see what I can do.”\n\nZhou Ze reached up and rubbed the bridge of his nose.\n\nTrouble.\n\nThis is really so much trouble.\n\nAs a newly-minted homebody, all he wanted to do was open a shop, do a little business, and at night, lie on Bai Yingying’s lap, eating grapes she peeled for him.\n\nHaving to go on a long trip now was indeed very frustrating.\n\n“Please send us down. Send all of us down together. On the Yellow Springs Road, I will escort them to see the judge. I want to personally witness them being brought to justice.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nHe opened the Gate to Hell.\n\nAt the same time, he asked, “Were they drug… traffickers?”\n\nThe man in black shook his head.\n\n“Smugglers, then?”\n\n“It was gambling,” the man in black said gravely.\n\n“Oh.” Zhou Ze was a little puzzled. Did busting a gambling ring require such a huge effort?\n\n“Gambling with human lives as the stakes.”\n\nThe man in black glanced at Zhou Ze but didn't elaborate, because he knew Zhou Ze wasn't very interested in the matter.\n\nHe grabbed the three little ghosts and walked through the Gate to Hell.\n\nA moment later,\n\nthey vanished like smoke.\n\nZhou Ze clapped his hands and took out his notebook to check. The performance chart column had risen to twenty percent.\n\nEighty percent left to go, but judging by the new shop’s business, it probably wouldn’t take too long to become a permanent employee.\n\nHe picked up his teacup, ready to walk back to his counter and continue being the leisurely Boss Zhou, but he discovered that sometime, someone had appeared behind him.\n\nIt was Tang Shi.\n\nShe was still chewing on a White Rabbit candy.\n\n“Why didn’t you agree to investigate? It’s so interesting,” Tang Shi asked.\n\n“I don’t have that kind of time.” Zhou Ze walked back to the counter and sat down.\n\n“Gambling with human lives as the stakes, that sounds quite interesting,” Tang Shi continued. “If *he* were here, he would go take a look.”\n\n“He is him, and I am me.”\n\n“Oh, business seems good today. Looks like the old saying is true: a tree moved will die, a person moved will thrive.” Tang Shi walked to the doorway, looking at the two female university students still taking shelter from the rain.\n\n“The rain hasn’t stopped yet.”\n\n“You didn't stay upstairs, so you came down just to be sentimental?” Zhou Ze asked, a little surprised.\n\nTang Shi shook her head.\n\nThen she opened her hand.\n\nA paper crane made from folded paper danced gracefully, looking incredibly lifelike.\n\n“Zhou Ze, did you know? Sometimes, you can’t avoid trouble just by trying to sidestep it.”\n\n“But at least it can reduce the trouble a little.” Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n“I haven’t had much to do these past two days, so I investigated you.”\n\n*As if you usually have anything to do.*\n\nIn Zhou Ze’s eyes, if you stripped away her special abilities and her status as a transmigrator, Tang Shi was just a pretty face—incapable of anything and unwilling to do anything.\n\nExcept for her nice legs.\n\nCould look at those for a year.\n\n“Where are your eyes looking?”\n\nThe ballpoint pen on Zhou Ze’s counter floated up and hovered in front of his eyes, as if it might poke them out at any moment.\n\n“You look much better in black stockings than nude ones,” Zhou Ze commented.\n\nTang Shi tossed her phone out, and it floated in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nOn it was a news screenshot.\n\nA riot had broken out in a prison in Subei. One inmate had died, and more than ten others were injured.\n\n“What’s this about?” Zhou Ze asked, looking at the screen.\n\n“How much do you hate trouble?” Tang Shi shook her head helplessly. “You don’t even recognize the man who ran you over with a large truck?”\n\nZhou Ze’s pupils contracted instantly.\n\n“I didn’t do it,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“I know you didn’t do it,” Tang Shi said. “But he’s dead.”\n\n“An accident, probably. Maybe they liked to play hide-and-seek too?”\n\nZhou Ze shrugged.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked down the stairs. He slapped his forehead and said to Zhou Ze:\n\n“Old Zhou, my bad. I forgot something a few days ago. That uncle of yours was looking for you during the days you were missing. He said his son, your cousin, died in a car accident and wanted you to attend the funeral.\n\n“At the time, I figured since you’re Zhou Ze, Xu Le’s relatives don't have much to do with you. Plus you weren’t around then, so I forgot. I just remembered, so I’m telling you now. The funeral was probably half a month ago, it’s long over.”\n\nUpon hearing this,\n\nZhou Ze’s expression,\n\nfinally turned serious.\n\nInexplicably,\n\nit felt as if a vortex,\n\nhad already begun to stir, unnoticed.\n\n---\n¹ Lei Feng was a soldier in the People's Liberation Army of China who became a national icon after his death, celebrated as a model of selflessness and modesty. \"Learn from Lei Feng\" is a common phrase encouraging good citizenship and altruism.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze hated trouble, he really, *really* hated trouble, but that didn't mean that when something came for him by name, he would be foolish enough to bury his head in the sand and pretend he couldn't see a thing.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze's expression turn so grave after he'd spoken, Xu Qinglang was taken aback himself and asked subconsciously:\n\n\"Is something wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"No, it's nothing.\"\n\n\"Then I'll head up?\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went upstairs, looking back every few steps. He instinctively felt that something was wrong, but since Zhou Ze wasn't willing to share, he didn't press the issue. Everyone had their own little secrets, their own calculations.\n\n\"My, you've gotten serious, haven't you?\"\n\nTang Shi watched Zhou Ze, a smile that wasn't quite a smile on her face.\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at Tang Shi. He tapped the ash from his cigarette and said:\n\n\"Why did you investigate me?\"\n\n\"I told you, it was out of curiosity.\" Tang Shi walked over to the bar, closing the distance between herself and Zhou Ze. At the same time, her fingertips traced a path across the counter. \"You know, you're different from us. Truly different.\"\n\n\"You've said that before. Because I've never truly experienced Hell, while you all have been tortured.\"\n\n\"No, it's not that simple. That other one and I, we experienced the great terror of Hell and narrowly escaped. You, on the other hand, had just set foot on the Yellow Springs Road before you managed to escape with your life.\n\nYou know,\n\none event, one experience,\n\nis enough to completely change a person.\n\nFor instance, whenever that other one and I even mention the word 'Hell,' we flinch subconsciously, because that word and all the images it entails are a great terror seared into our hearts.\n\nEven though we've both been 'reborn,' our personalities and behaviors were drastically changed by it.\n\nYou're different. You just took a little trip to Hell's suburbs and came right back.\n\nThat's why you can sit at a small table with that police officer and laugh about Hell, chatting and laughing breezily.\"\n\n\"So, what does that mean? What else did you find?\"\n\nThe truck driver who ran him over was dead.\n\nXu Le's cousin, who had helped Xu Le hire the hitman, was also dead.\n\nTwo people, dead in a short span of time.\n\nAn ordinary person might not connect these two deaths, but to Zhou Ze, this was highly unusual.\n\nXu Le was dead, his body given to him.\n\nThe driver was dead.\n\nThe cousin was dead too.\n\nEveryone involved in the original incident was dead.\n\nCould it really be such a coincidence?\n\n\"We're anomalies in this world. We're not even like the underworld emissaries. We're stowaways. And you... you're an anomaly among anomalies.\n\nWe are not the same.\"\n\n\"Get to the point.\" Zhou Ze tapped on the blackboard (the bar counter).\n\n\"Have you never suspected that your death and your rebirth were not an accident?\"\n\nTang Shi lowered her voice and asked slowly,\n\n\"Think about it carefully. Are there any details in all of this that you previously overlooked?\"\n\n...\n\n\"They're coming for me, they've found me...\"\n\nThe old man's nails digging into his own arm, and his final smile of relief.\n\nAt the traffic light, just as his car started to move forward,\n\na large truck ran a red light,\n\nand came straight for him.\n\nThe flames of the crematorium and its scorching heat;\n\nThe numbness and desolation on the Yellow Springs Road.\n\nThe roar and resentment of the Faceless Woman,\n\nThe black nails that grew from his fingertips.\n\nHimself, staggering dazedly by the roadside,\n\nA man in a hoodie running out of the bookstore,\n\nHe beat Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\n\nAnd then he entered Xu Le's body.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head and opened his eyes.\n\nThe man who killed Xu Le...\n\nAfter he reported it to the police that day, what had become of him?\n\nThis was something Zhou Ze had consistently overlooked.\n\nHe had been so caught up in the bookstore and Dr. Lin, viewing Xu Le's death and his own \"cuckoo in the nest\" situation as a form of karmic justice.\n\nA case of divine retribution.\n\nBut if the old man in the hospital intentionally dug his nails into his arm,\n\nif the truck driver intentionally ran the red light to kill him,\n\nif so many people had acted with intent,\n\nthen,\n\nthat man, whom he had explained away as someone who impulsively tried to rob some money and bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat—\n\ncould he,\n\npossibly have been intentional too?\n\nIf he *was* intentional,\n\nit would mean that the entire chain of events, from his death to his new life,\n\nwas all a deliberate design. He was like a toy race car on a track; he seemed to be speeding along freely, but in reality, he was just following a predetermined path.\n\n\"Looks like you've thought of something.\"\n\nTang Shi popped another White Rabbit milk candy¹ into her mouth.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his phone. He was going to call the police station. He had reported the case last time and even gone to the station to give a statement. His first meeting with Dr. Lin had also been at the police station.\n\nThe female officer had led Dr. Lin to him and said, \"Your wife is here to pick you up.\"\n\nZhou Ze had been in a daze for quite a while after that.\n\nHowever, before dialing, Zhou Ze looked at Tang Shi and asked:\n\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"You know, compared to us,\n\nit's like an adorable husky\n\nhas wandered into a wolf pack.\"\n\n...\n\nThe rain was still falling, showing no signs of letting up. Tongcheng was located in the Yangtze River Delta region, a season naturally abundant with rain.\n\nThere were no earthquakes or tsunamis here. The only thing that happened often enough to cause some impact was urban flooding.\n\nWearing a raincoat, Zhou Ze walked beneath an old apartment building. The trash cans were already soaked through by the rain, and some garbage had floated out.\n\nTang Shi wore rain boots and a black raincoat, her legs faintly visible in the downpour, but Zhou Ze was in no mood to appreciate such a sight.\n\nHe had called earlier to check on the situation. The man he had turned in to the police station had only been detained for half a month on the charge of violating public security regulations. After all, although he had come to Zhou Ze's shop to \"commit violence,\" the end result was that he was taken down by Zhou Ze, making it difficult to pin any major crime on him.\n\nBesides, it's not like Zhou Ze could say:\n\nMr. Policeman,\n\nhe's a murderer,\n\nhe killed me,\n\nand I'm not me,\n\nI've been reincarnated in another's body!!!\n\nIf he'd said that,\n\nhe probably wouldn't have been the one going to jail;\n\nhe'd be the one getting forcibly committed to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nStill, Zhou Ze had managed to get the man's address from them, which was in this area.\n\n\"This is it.\"\n\nGoing up to the second floor, Zhou Ze stopped in front of a door.\n\nMost of the units in this complex were rented out to migrant workers who came to Tongcheng for work. The environment and facilities were quite poor, and they even used communal bathrooms.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"The door number should be right.\"\n\nZhou Ze tried to peer through the window. It was blocked by a screen and old curtains, so he couldn't see clearly inside from the outside.\n\n\"I'll go find something to pry the door open...\"\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nThe lock opened by itself.\n\nTang Shi made a \"please\" gesture to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze paused,\n\nsmiled,\n\nand walked in.\n\n*What a waste not to go into business as a thief with you,* he thought.\n\nThe place was essentially a studio apartment.\n\nOne room,\n\ncontaining a bed, a wardrobe, and a small countertop with an induction cooker.\n\nThe room was tidied up quite neatly, but dust had accumulated in some places, indicating it hadn't been lived in for a long time.\n\n\"How long has he been out?\"\n\n\"Several months now. I sent him to the police station the day after I was reborn, and he was released half a month later.\"\n\nZhou Ze scanned his surroundings, examining the details.\n\n\"Did he move?\" Tang Shi said.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Not sure.\"\n\nThe guy who beat Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\n\nhad he disappeared?\n\nZhou Ze suddenly noticed that an area on the wall behind the bed looked different. He stepped onto the bed, reached out to feel that part of the wall, and then said:\n\n\"This part of the wall... it looks like it was painted over later.\"\n\n\"Is there something hidden inside?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\nZhou Ze pressed his ear against the wall and tapped it with his hand. \"Doesn't sound hollow.\"\n\nIn truth, hollow spots in the walls of this type of building were very common. When renovating a new apartment, the construction team would first send a veteran worker to tap all the walls and floors with a ruler. If they found any problems, they'd ask the developer to fix them before starting the renovation work.\n\n\"We'll know if we open it up,\" Tang Shi said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He was about to say he would go find some tools, but then he glanced at Tang Shi and consciously took a few steps back.\n\nTang Shi's gaze fell on the kitchen knife and other hard objects next to the induction cooker. The objects then flew out, repeatedly striking and drilling into that section of the wall, over and over.\n\nThe thought of opening a construction company popped into Zhou Ze's head again.\n\nBai Yingying alone was worth a whole construction crew's labor.\n\nTang Shi could replace a whole set of construction machinery.\n\nHe would just have to sit back and count the money.\n\nHowever, as the wall continued to crack, Zhou Ze immediately banished those miscellaneous thoughts from his mind.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nA piece of the wall broke and fell away.\n\nA human face was revealed.\n\nThe face was frozen in a horrified expression, as if perfectly preserving the emotional state just before death.\n\nIt was him.\n\nIt was the man who had bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat!\n\nIn the air,\n\na sour smell permeated.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and examined the corpse inside, frowning. He said:\n\n\"The body looks like it's been dead for less than a week.\"\n\n\"You don't seem to be a forensic pathologist,\" Tang Shi reminded him.\n\n\"This is basic knowledge for a surgeon. You can roughly estimate the time of death based on the post-mortem condition of the body,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Then I can tell you, the wall I just broke through was definitely not sealed up less than a week ago. It's been at least three months.\"\n\nTang Shi unwrapped a milk candy, put it in her mouth, and continued:\n\n\"Unless you think he was killed a week ago and then moved into a wall that was sealed three months prior.\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately realized something was wrong.\n\nObviously, the body couldn't have been \"teleported\" into the wall later, and the wall had been perfectly intact before Tang Shi broke it open.\n\nHe sniffed the air.\n\nThat sour smell...\n\nHe had initially thought it was just the stench of the corpse.\n\nBut now,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly realized something. He pushed aside the corpse's hair,\n\nand sure enough,\n\nhe found a small puncture mark. An injection site.\n\n\"Yes, the body has been dead for a long time, but it was injected with formalin, which is why it's so well-preserved.\n\nAlso,\n\nthe formalin was probably injected slowly while he was still alive.\n\nBecause using the bloodstream to spread it throughout the body would be much more effective.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **White Rabbit milk candy:** A very famous and nostalgic brand of milk-flavored chewy candy from China.",

    "content": "Outside, Zhou Ze was smoking a cigarette. Tang Shi stood beside him, chewing on a milk candy.\n\nInside, the corpse slumped down from the wall, the terrifying expression on its face perfectly clear, as if the murder and concealment had just occurred.\n\nThey were all dead.\n\nNot a single one was left.\n\nXu Le was dead.\n\nThe person who killed Xu Le was dead.\n\nThe hit-and-run driver was dead.\n\nThe cousin was dead.\n\nEvery point on the line was dead.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, in a way, was dead too.\n\nJust as Tang Shi had said, sometimes it wasn't a matter of deliberately avoiding trouble, and trouble would truly not come looking for you.\n\nA pocket had been opened long ago. Whether you were willing or not, whether you liked it or not, you were already inside it.\n\n\"They're all dead, so the trail of clues is broken, I suppose.\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze with a smile on her lips. She seemed to enjoy seeing him in this state of mind.\n\nIn a pack of wolves, where every wolf was brooding and grim-faced all day, a husky suddenly appeared, wanting only to lie there and be cute.\n\nIt was truly an irritating thing.\n\nOn what grounds are we all so heavy-hearted,\n\nwhile you alone get to be innocent and carefree?\n\nOne worries not about scarcity, but about unequal distribution.¹ This principle didn't just apply to the allocation of money.\n\n\"From the looks of it, that's indeed the case.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and rubbed the bridge of his nose.\n\n\"And, I have to worry about one more thing: whether or not the police investigation will eventually lead to me.\"\n\nThe mastermind, the one who paid for it, was Xu Le.\n\nThe driver was dead, and the middleman, the cousin, was also dead.\n\nThe reason Zhou Ze had resisted taking revenge before was this very thing; he didn't want to expose himself, because it would destroy the life he had now.\n\nModern society was very different from ancient times. Even if the ancients had household registration systems, it wasn't actually that difficult for a person without an identity to hide and live in seclusion.\n\nBut in modern society, a person's identity tags were extremely important. Of course, Zhou Ze could hide if he wanted to, but the price would be a rapid decline in his quality of life, constantly hiding and on the run.\n\nRight now, Zhou Ze hadn't killed these people, but he naturally had to bear the potential fallout from their deaths.\n\nHe didn't get to enjoy the thrill of revenge,\n\nand he still had to take the blame.\n\nSo infuriating!\n\nTaking out his phone, Zhou Ze dialed the police station's number.\n\n\"Hello, I need to report a crime.\"\n\nTang Shi didn't accompany Zhou Ze to the police station, but went back to the bookstore first. Accompanying Zhou Ze to inspect a murder scene in the rain, wearing a raincoat and stepping through muddy roads, was already the absolute limit of what she could do. She couldn't possibly go with him to face the complicated reports and interrogations at the police station.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze, he had no choice. He had to do it. After all, he had just called the police station to ask for the deceased's address. If he didn't report it now, his suspicion would only grow when the body was eventually discovered.\n\nAnd as for secretly disposing of the body, Zhou Ze was unwilling to do so. Until he could figure out who was pulling the strings behind the scenes, Zhou Ze didn't want to act clever and help someone else clean up their mess.\n\nIt was possible that, with one careless move, he might just dig a pit and bury himself.\n\n...\n\nThe investigation and questioning continued until after eight o'clock that night. Several waves of police officers took turns, and it was clear that they were treating Zhou Ze as the murderer.\n\nDon't assume that a murderer wouldn't take the initiative to report the crime.\n\nIn fact,\n\naccording to the police's big data statistics, more than eighty percent of murderers in homicide cases would disguise themselves as \"onlookers\" and return to the crime scene.\n\nMost murderers did it to create an alibi and check for information; a small portion did it out of the twisted mentality of \"I killed someone, so I must go admire my work of art.\"\n\nIf the deceased went undiscovered for a long time, it was undoubtedly like a bright pearl cast into darkness for the murderer. Mona Lisa's smile covered by a black cloth, scratching at one's heart until it itched, so they might as well report it themselves to get the veil lifted.\n\nIn the end, an old detective with half-white hair sat before Zhou Ze, closed his notebook, and said to him:\n\n\"Mr. Zhou, you may leave. But please do not leave Tongcheng for the next month. We may need to contact you again for more information.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, left the interrogation room, and walked to the entrance of the police station.\n\nHe turned his head and looked back at the police officers coming and going, and the row of police cars parked inside. For some reason, he felt a wave of pressure.\n\nPerhaps, before long, the truth of that fabricated car accident would also surface. At that time, what he would face might be a real storm.\n\nHe was the true victim, but the real murderer,\n\nwas also him.\n\nZhou Ze was preparing to head back to the bookstore. He was a bit tired and wanted to rest first, but his phone rang at that moment. It was his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, your uncle is here again. He's sitting in the stairwell. I asked him to come in and sit, but he refused. He just said he wants to wait for you to come back.\"\n\nUncle?\n\n\"Just tell him I'm not coming back, and don't tell him my new store's address.\" Zhou Ze didn't want to deal with irrelevant people right now.\n\n*Clang!*\n\nThe sound of a door being smashed came from the other end of the line.\n\nZhou Ze's brow furrowed slightly. He asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Uh, your uncle is smashing the door. He said, if you don't come back today, he's going to make you go to jail.\"\n\nHearing this,\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head, clenched his teeth, and said, \"Tell him I'll be right back.\"\n\n...\n\nNo one wants to live like a punching bag. No one wants their life to be constrained. Everyone wants to be spontaneous, but such is life.\n\nWhen you're a few months old, you can pee everywhere, you can wet the bed at will, and your elders and relatives will still greet you with a smile and flick your little ding-ding.\n\nBut when you're in your teens or twenties, trying to pee wherever you want, trying to get your ding-ding flicked, is impossible.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the scene of a forty-five-year-old elder flicking the ding-ding of a twenty-something young man:\n\n\"You peed again, you naughty boy.\"\n\nThe image is just too cringey.\n\nAnd so, when Zhou Ze appeared before Xu Dachuan,\n\nXu Dachuan's face was grim,\n\nand Zhou Ze's face was also gloomy.\n\nNo one was happy.\n\nNo one was cheerful.\n\nBut they still had to meet.\n\nXu Dachuan hadn't harmed the people inside the house. When Zhou Ze arrived, he was squatting there, smoking his dry pipe. Seeing Zhou Ze approach, he stood up and patted his trouser legs.\n\n\"Come for a walk with me.\"\n\nThis time, Xu Dachuan hadn't brought any local specialties; he came empty-handed.\n\nZhou Ze walked out with Xu Dachuan. He didn't bother to greet his sister-in-law and Doctor Lin, who were peeking through the crack of the door.\n\nThe two of them walked out of the residential complex.\n\nThe sky had completely darkened.\n\nUnder the streetlights, there weren't many people.\n\nXu Dachuan walked for a stretch, then squatted down again, puffing on his dry pipe with a \"smack, smack\" sound.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside him.\n\n\"Little Chuanzi has already been cremated,\" Xu Dachuan said.\n\nLittle Chuanzi must have been the cousin's nickname.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zhou Ze responded. \"I wasn't in Tongcheng at the time.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\"\n\nXu Dachuan tapped his pipe stem and looked up. His face was full of the vicissitudes of life and deep wrinkles. This was a simple and honest old man who had worked hard to support his family. Xu Le, the college student, was actually someone he had paid for.\n\n\"Ah Le, you really were out of line for not coming to Little Chuanzi's funeral.\"\n\nXu Dachuan's eyes grew moist. He squatted there, wiping the tears from the corners of his eyes with the back of his chapped hand.\n\n\"I said, I wasn't in Tongcheng at the time.\"\n\nXu Dachuan suddenly stood up, grabbed Zhou Ze by the collar, and shoved him against a telephone pole.\n\n\"Ah Le, tell your uncle the truth. Little Chuanzi... did you do him in?!\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly. There was a lot of information in the question Xu Dachuan had just asked.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had a somewhat good impression of Xu Dachuan.\n\nRight and wrong, it had nothing to do with him. Besides, Xu Dachuan was the first stranger since his rebirth to genuinely show him concern.\n\nHe could endure the disdain of the Lin family to come see him with local specialties.\n\nEven in his hospital bed, he would still smile at Doctor Lin, his nephew's wife, with utter satisfaction.\n\nHe had even said that if being a live-in son-in-law didn't work out, he could just go back and farm with him.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, he was supposed to be simple, kind, a piece of pure land.\n\nBut now, it seemed this pure land wasn't as pure as he had imagined.\n\n\"It wasn't me.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gripped Xu Dachuan's wrist.\n\n\"The business between you and Little Chuanzi, don't think I don't know about it. I also know that Little Chuanzi has been coming to you for money recently. He was immature, he was a disappointment, he had a thousand faults.\n\n\"But he was your brother, after all!\"\n\nXu Dachuan's eyes began to turn bloodshot. He seemed on the verge of going mad.\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt disgusted by the man before him,\n\nthis simple, honest fellow.\n\n\"You don't know what I'm talking about?\"\n\nXu Dachuan brought his face close to Zhou Ze's and said, word by word:\n\n\"That driver, isn't he dead? He's from the village next to mine. You think Little Chuanzi knew anyone? You think he knew who was tight-lipped?\n\n\"He's just a kid, what right did he have to negotiate with people?\n\n\"That driver... I was the one who went to find him, to negotiate.\n\n\"Uncle wanted you to have a good life! Your wife fell for someone else, you were living a miserable life, so Uncle helped you get rid of that other man!\n\n\"Uncle wants all the kids in our family to live comfortably, not to be bullied, not to be looked down on.\n\n\"But,\n\n\"Ah Le,\n\n\"You can't kill Little Chuanzi to silence him!\n\n\"Your father died young. It was your uncle who paid for your education. Uncle has always treated you like his own son!\n\n\"Tell your uncle the honest truth from the bottom of your heart,\n\n\"Did you have Little Chuanzi deliberately run over and killed, just like last time?\n\n\"Were you trying to silence him?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nXu Dachuan was asking the wrong person.\n\nIn fact,\n\nevery question he asked was like pouring oil on the fire.\n\nHe had to know, the one standing before him,\n\nwas not his nephew, Xu Le,\n\nbut the true victim in that incident, the aggrieved party!\n\n*Thump!*\n\nZhou Ze kicked out, sending Xu Dachuan sprawling to the ground.\n\nAt this very moment, Zhou Ze felt an uncontrollable urge to blow his own cover.\n\nHe regretted it. He regretted it deeply. If he had known it would come to this, he should have just turned himself in to the police right after he was reborn.\n\nXu Le's cousin,\n\nXu Dachuan,\n\nthat driver,\n\nlet them all face the judgment of the law. Even if he, in Xu Le's identity, got implicated along with them, he didn't care.\n\nTo use this second life he'd gained to avenge his first life—that seemed like a satisfying way to settle scores.\n\nAt least,\n\nit would be so much better than the dilemma he was in now.\n\nBut now,\n\nthe cousin and the driver were both dead. The person who killed Xu Le was also dead. They had died so cleanly, leaving Zhou Ze with no way to even begin his revenge.\n\nYou have strength, you have power, but when you punch a ball of cotton, it's always frustrating.\n\nXu Dachuan, who had been kicked to the ground, immediately scrambled back up and roared at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Ah Le, you're the one who turned on family!\n\n\"I'm going to the Public Security Bureau to report you!\n\n\"You're a murderer!\n\n\"A murderer!\n\n\"I want you to be buried with Little Chuanzi, be buried with him!!!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Dachuan,\n\nlooked at this old man who, even now, still appeared weather-beaten and憨厚 (simple and honest).\n\nHis left hand, held behind his back,\n\nslowly began to grow black fingernails.\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched into a smile,\n\nas if savoring the words:\n\n\"Buried with him?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

    "content": "Xu Dachuan was screaming and shouting, acting like a madman. This man, in the days since his son's death, had been enduring immense psychological pressure and torment.\n\nHe felt deeply wronged.\n\nHe felt he was in great pain.\n\nHe felt his life had been full of hardships, that it hadn’t been easy.\n\nHad anyone else been standing there in Zhou Ze's place, perhaps they might have been stirred to some sympathy and pity.\n\nBut unfortunately,\n\nthe one standing before him was Zhou Ze.\n\nAnyone might sympathize with him,\n\nbut not Zhou Ze.\n\nHe had died,\n\nand this coarse man, crying, raving, and hysterical before him,\n\nwas one of the accomplices in his own murder.\n\n*Why do you all think you're so pitiful?*\n\n*Why do you all feel so wronged?*\n\n*Then what about me?*\n\n*Who will pity me?*\n\n*Who will spare a thought for me?*\n\nZhou Ze walked naturally over to Xu Dachuan. He lifted his chin. At that moment, countless emotions were wildly driving him to kill the man before him.\n\nTo tear him to shreds,\n\nnot just his body,\n\nbut his soul as well!\n\nOnly by making him suffer the greatest pain and torment could the rage in his own heart be quelled!\n\nLife, it seemed, was always full of coincidences. A police car drove over from a distance.\n\nZhou Ze watched the flashing lights on top of the police car. In that instant, he felt no trepidation, no fear. He even felt a sense of relief, the kind that comes from giving up all hope.\n\nIf all of this really was just a pocket.\n\nThen,\n\nI might as well go mad along with it.\n\nRather than suffering this injustice alone,\n\nit's better if everyone,\n\nhurts each other!\n\nXu Dachuan was still shouting and jumping about. The police car pulled over beside them, and two officers got out. They might have been on patrol, or perhaps just passing by, but they still got out to assess the situation.\n\nThe police officers walked over. Xu Dachuan suddenly fell quiet. He stared at Zhou Ze with a venomous glare, then looked at the officers.\n\nHe began to walk toward the police of his own accord.\n\nMeanwhile, on Zhou Ze's hands, held behind his back, his nails had fully grown out, and wisps of black energy swirled incessantly around his ten fingers.\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\nDeep within his pupils,\n\na black torrent seemed to be flowing.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze seemed to be gradually rediscovering the feeling he had on the rooftop that day—the feeling of being completely abandoned by society, by life itself.\n\nThat loneliness, that helplessness,\n\nunceasingly unleashed the repression that had built up deep inside him.\n\nI am an Emissary of Hell.\n\nI have died once.\n\nI cultivate my character,\n\nbut I don't enjoy swallowing insults in silence.\n\nIf a storm is about to break,\n\nthen in the midst of this downpour,\n\nI will let myself go one more time.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had always been fearful. He was afraid of becoming like that one from Rongcheng, a cautionary tale of one who was suppressed.\n\nBut sometimes, it's truly difficult to control yourself.\n\nOf course, what's even harder to control is the vortex around you. It actively pushes you, eggs you on, forces you,\n\nstep by step,\n\ntowards the abyss.\n\n\"What's going on?\" one officer asked, walking up to Xu Dachuan. The other, a middle-aged officer, was looking at Zhou Ze.\n\nInstinctively, the middle-aged officer sensed a trace of danger from Zhou Ze. It was a sixth sense honed by his many years on the force.\n\nAlthough the young man before him was somewhat thin and looked as if a gust of wind could blow him over—and he even had his eyes closed—the middle-aged officer found his own lips growing dry.\n\nIt was a bit embarrassing to admit, but right now, he actually felt a little nervous.\n\n*Heh, I must be seeing things,*\n\n*what am I nervous about.*\n\n\"It's nothing. I had a bit to drink and was scolding a junior. The kid's not listening, wants to divorce his wife. He needs a talking-to!\"\n\nXu Dachuan said, his eyes bloodshot.\n\nThe two officers exchanged a look. Since it was a family matter, they decided not to get involved. They immediately got back in their car, and the police car drove off.\n\nThe middle-aged officer glanced back over his shoulder again.\n\n\"Brother Cui, what are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThe middle-aged officer sat up straight and shook his head.\n\nOn the roadside,\n\nXu Dachuan turned his head and looked at Zhou Ze again.\n\n\"Hork... ptui!\"\n\nHe spat a thick wad of phlegm heavily onto the ground.\n\nXu Dachuan, who had just been clamoring to call the police and report Zhou Ze, had not reported him to the officers.\n\nAs a father who had already lost his son, it wasn't that he was afraid of implicating himself. It could only be said that, at that critical moment, his heart had softened.\n\n\"You'd better find someone to get rid of me, too. That way, no one will ever know what you've done!\"\n\nXu Dachuan growled.\n\nHis son was dead; he wasn't willing to send this nephew to the execution ground as well. Otherwise, his family line would be completely cut off.\n\nHis way of thinking was simple,\n\ntruly, very, very simple.\n\nHis own nephew's wife had found someone she liked on the outside,\n\nso he helped get rid of that guy!\n\nNow that his own son was dead, he couldn't let the old Xu family line die out.\n\nSo noble?\n\nYes,\n\nvery noble.\n\nBut in Zhou Ze's eyes,\n\nit was exceptionally disgusting.\n\nXu Dachuan bent down to pick up his long-stemmed pipe. He was ready to leave, ready to go home. He had thought for a long time and been angry for a long time, but at this moment, he still didn't have the courage to actually drag Xu Le down to be buried with his son.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze stepped on Xu Dachuan's long-stemmed pipe.\n\nXu Dachuan looked up, somewhat stunned.\n\nZhou Ze slowly bent down and picked up the pipe.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nThe pipe struck Xu Dachuan's body heavily.\n\nXu Dachuan let out a muffled groan, staring at Zhou Ze in disbelief.\n\n\"You dare...\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nAnother vicious strike landed, knocking Xu Dachuan to the ground. He'd had surgery on his leg a while ago and it hadn't fully healed yet. Faced with Zhou Ze's sudden outburst, he could only curl up on the ground.\n\nThe police were long gone; naturally, they couldn't see this scene.\n\n\"I'll teach you to be noble!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nHe struck him again.\n\n\"I'll teach you to have a soft heart!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nHe struck him again.\n\n\"I'll teach you to feel so wronged!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\n\"I'll teach you to think your life is so hard!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\n\"I'll teach you that life is difficult!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\n\"I'll teach you to be pitiful!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze, who had suppressed his endurance for so long, beat Xu Dachuan in a frenzy, striking him again and again until Xu Dachuan was left trembling on the ground.\n\nFinally,\n\nhe dropped the pipe,\n\nand Zhou Ze staggered back a few steps,\n\nleaning against a utility pole.\n\n\"Cough... cough...\"\n\nDeep coughs escaped his lips.\n\nHe lifted his head,\n\nand looked up at the dim night sky.\n\nSome of the rage in his heart had been vented,\n\nbut deep down, he didn't feel much relief.\n\nThese people,\n\nthey were devoted fathers and filial sons,\n\nthey were loving and respectful brothers,\n\nthey helped each other, they were considerate of one another,\n\nbut the more it was so, the more it disgusted Zhou Ze.\n\nTurning his back on the bruised and swollen Xu Dachuan curled up on the ground, Zhou Ze walked slowly forward, alone.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.\n\nThen he pinched out the flame with his nail, crumbled the remaining tobacco, and put it in his mouth, chewing it slowly.\n\nHe took out his phone to hail a cab, but there were no cars nearby.\n\nHaving no other choice,\n\nZhou Ze dialed Xu Qinglang's number.\n\n\"Hey, Old Zhou, what's up? Not open for business today?\"\n\n\"Come pick me up.\"\n\nZhou Ze gave him the address.\n\n\"Hold on, I'll call Old Daoist. He just took my car to go buy candy for that woman. I'll have him pick you up on his way back.\"\n\nAfter hanging up,\n\nZhou Ze spat out the tobacco shreds from his mouth and leaned against the utility pole, staring into space for a long time.\n\nHe hadn't killed Xu Dachuan.\n\nUnder this pocket,\n\nno one was truly innocent,\n\nbut it seemed everyone was a marionette, doing what they were supposed to do at predetermined points,\n\nand in the end,\n\nused up and destroyed.\n\nSomeone was guiding all of this, acting like a catalyst, accelerating the entire process.\n\nThat person,\n\nwas the real driving force, the true culprit who had caused his death in a car accident in his past life.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, a black Nissan pulled up beside Zhou Ze. The window rolled down, revealing Old Daoist's face.\n\n\"Boss, I found you.\"\n\nOld Daoist eagerly got out first to open the car door for Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze got in. Old Daoist then eagerly took a piece of milk candy from a large bag and offered it to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, have one.\"\n\nZhou Ze pushed his hand away, indicating he wasn't in the mood.\n\nOld Daoist gave an awkward smile, not taking it to heart.\n\nAfter all, compared to Zhou Ze, his previous boss at the netherworld store had been much more difficult to get along with.\n\nZhou Ze was actually much more peaceful and amicable than the last one. Of course, that wasn't to say the previous boss had a bad temper, but whenever he sat behind the counter, Old Daoist naturally didn't even dare to speak too loudly.\n\n\"If you don't want candy, have a cigarette.\"\n\nOld Daoist offered Zhou Ze a cigarette and lit it for him before returning to the driver's seat.\n\nThe car started moving. Old Daoist made a turn and headed back.\n\nAt the upcoming intersection, Old Daoist turned right. As he passed the entrance to a residential complex, he subconsciously slowed down and craned his neck to look inside.\n\nThis was the complex where the Lin family lived.\n\nEarlier, Zhou Ze had come here, met Xu Dachuan, and the two had walked some distance, but it couldn't have been too far.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, this is the place. You didn't know?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Didn't Miss Tang tell you before? When she was injured, she could only hide in a place that was 'darkest under the lamp.'¹ There are only two such places in Tongcheng.\n\n\"One is your bookstore.\n\n\"The other is this residential complex right here.\n\n\"But Miss Tang said the 'lamp' here seemed to have a problem, so in the end, we chose to hide out at your place to escape our pursuers.\"\n\nOld Daoist said this matter-of-factly,\n\nnot noticing,\n\nthat the hand Zhou Ze was using to hold his cigarette,\n\nwas trembling slightly...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  `燈下黑` (dēng xià hēi): Literally \"darkness under the lamp.\" An idiom meaning a place that is dangerously close to a source of power/danger and is therefore overlooked and paradoxically safe.",

    "content": "\"Lao Dao.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss, what's up?\"\n\n\"Pull over.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nGetting out of the car, Zhou Ze tossed the cigarette butt in his hand onto the ground and crushed it under his shoe.\n\n\"You can head back first.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Lao Dao froze for a moment. \"Boss, I can wait for you to come out.\"\n\n\"Just go back.\"\n\n\"It's no problem, Boss. I don't mind waiting...\"\n\n\"Go back.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked at Lao Dao.\n\nLao Dao shivered in fear.\n\n*Tsk, tsk, tsk.*\n\n*As expected, these guys who crawled out of hell are all the same at their core. This one in front of me seemed so friendly before, but it was all just a disguise.*\n\n*A disguise!*\n\nLao Dao immediately gave a salute. \"Yes, Boss. Call me when you need the car.\"\n\nLao Dao drove away.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the entrance of the residential complex, lingering for about a quarter of an hour.\n\nTang Shi had told him before that after the little lolita left Tongcheng, besides his own bookstore, there was another blind spot.¹\n\nHowever, there might have been a problem with this \"lamp,\" which was why Tang Shi hadn't chosen to hide here, going to his bookstore instead.\n\nTang Shi had hinted that he could go take a look, that he might find something unexpected and reap some rewards. To strike while the enemy is down, or at the very least, take some advantage.\n\nAt the time, Zhou Ze, afraid of the trouble, didn't go, nor did he even ask for details.\n\nAnd so, it wasn't until just now, from Lao Dao's mouth, that Zhou Ze learned this blind spot was actually the very residential complex where Dr. Lin lived.\n\nThe dots, one by one, formed a circle.\n\nEven if those dots were all gone, the circle had ultimately still taken shape.\n\nHis changing impressions of Dr. Lin over time,\n\nDr. Lin keeping his house from his previous life, buying it, and meticulously maintaining it,\n\nXu Le's identity,\n\nsleeping in separate beds,\n\nthe actual murder disguised as an accidental car crash,\n\nthe murders to silence witnesses, one by one, destroying the evidence.\n\nIn reality, so many details had long since pointed the way.\n\nIncluding that day at the hospital when, after pretending to be a doctor and completing the surgery, he had confessed to Dr. Lin,\n\nDr. Lin had taken the initiative to hug him.\n\nAt that moment, he had only felt how wonderful it all was, perhaps not noticing that the corners of the mouth of the face in his arms might have already curved into a slight smile.\n\nA single hand,\n\nit had stirred the waters of the deep pool, making the fish within begin to churn, until finally, the fishing net fell, closing to complete the catch.\n\nPeople weave nets to catch fish, and they catch fish to eat them;\n\npeople renovate houses for aesthetics, and aesthetics are for livability.\n\nEverything, in the end, has a purpose. Even sitting still in a daze is for the sake of enjoying the leisure of emptying one's mind.\n\nHis own previous death, his subsequent reincarnation in another's body,\n\nhis new identity, his new family relationships,\n\nin the end,\n\nwho benefited the most?\n\nThe woman who had always been secretly in love with him, who had a husband she didn't like, she had abided by the constraints of propriety, abided by the rules of the family.\n\nShe hadn't violated them, nor had she broken them, but within those rules, she had successfully managed to replace the husband she didn't like with someone else.\n\nSomeone that no outsider would know, no outsider would be aware of, no outsider could possibly discover.\n\nShe could lie by the bedside with a clear conscience, continuing to be her well-bred, ladylike self, living out the image her parents expected of her, while still doing things for her own ideas and pursuits.\n\nMany thoughts, a chaotic jumble,\n\nraced through Zhou Ze's mind, leaving him unable to get his bearings. At this moment, his heart was in such turmoil that he couldn't even get a grip on himself.\n\nIf all of this was truly as he suspected, if she was the one who had really manipulated the entire trajectory of events, then what kind of attitude should he face her with?\n\nAnger? Fury? That she had gotten him killed, destroyed his original life?\n\nBe moved? Resigned? After all, the more she did, the more it proved her feelings for him?\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze could grab a dry pipe and beat Xu Dachuan senseless without any psychological burden, but now, he lacked the spirit to even pick up a branch from the ground and rush into the Lin family home.\n\nHumans are just this kind of complex creature. He wasn't a robot, simply following the drive of a program, naturally making choices based on one trigger code after another.\n\nA quarter-hour of hesitation, a quarter-hour of indecision,\n\nIn the end,\n\nZhou Ze finally strode into the residential complex.\n\nSome things needed to be made clear, and some words had to be spoken.\n\nThis was for himself,\n\nan accounting for himself,\n\nan accounting for his past life.\n\nIgnorance is bliss,\n\ndid not apply here.\n\n\"Knock, knock, knock...\"\n\nHe knocked on the door.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had a key to the house, but it wasn't on him. He hadn't been back to the Lin residence for a long time.\n\n\"Coming.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law's voice came from inside. She opened the door, saw it was Zhou Ze, and asked:\n\n\"Xu Le, did your uncle leave?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he left.\"\n\n*Beaten away by me.*\n\n\"Oh.\" The sister-in-law hadn't opened the door all the way.\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze wasn't leaving, she said with some surprise:\n\n\"Do you want to come in?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't move.\n\nThe sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. Zhou Ze hadn't been home in a long time, and his sudden return had caught her unprepared. But at the end of the day, Zhou Ze was still her brother-in-law, so she opened the door.\n\nZhou Ze walked in and sat down on the living room sofa.\n\nHis sister-in-law brought him a bottle of orange juice and an ashtray. Her relationship with Zhou Ze had been pretty good recently because he often covered for her so she could go out and have fun. As a result, her attitude toward him at home had changed greatly from how it was at the beginning.\n\n\"Where's your sister?\"\n\n\"She just went out to buy groceries. My parents went on a trip yesterday. An old friend from another province has a child getting married, so they went to show their support. By the way, your uncle sitting at our doorstep just now really scared me.\n\nEspecially when he said he was going to send you to prison. Tsk, tsk. Xu Le, how come the relatives on your side of the family are all so weird?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law sat on the opposite sofa, turned on the TV, and propped her bare feet up on the coffee table. She had absolutely no proper posture, whether sitting or standing.\n\nCompared to Dr. Lin's natural grace and proper demeanor, they really didn't seem like sisters.\n\nReally,\n\nthey didn't seem alike at all.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, you haven't answered me yet. Does your uncle have some dirt on you? Did he come to you for money?\"\n\nXu Le was the Lin family's live-in son-in-law, so naturally, the Lins wouldn't have a good impression of his relatives, who were fond of freeloading. After all, the money Xu Le used to have was actually given to him by the Lin family.\n\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit another cigarette, preparing to wait for Dr. Lin to return.\n\n\"Really nothing?\" his sister-in-law asked, looking at him.\n\n\"You're so annoying.\"\n\nHearing this, the sister-in-law puffed out her cheeks and huffed in displeasure.\n\nShe felt that Xu Le was getting more and more out of line, but considering she would still need him to cover for her to go out and have fun in the future, she decided not to argue with him.\n\nA cigarette rested on the ashtray. Zhou Ze watched it slowly burn down.\n\nThe smoke curled, now gathering, now dispersing.\n\nJust then,\n\nthe sound of the door opening came from the entryway, and Zhou Ze stood up subconsciously.\n\nDr. Lin returned, carrying some groceries. Her hair was in a braid, and since she was on her day off, she looked very fresh and crisp.\n\nShe was a little surprised to see Zhou Ze at home.\n\n\"Sis, you're cooking today,\" the sister-in-law said, hugging a throw pillow and watching TV. She playfully pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Have you eaten?\" Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"No.\"\n\n\"Then wait a moment, I'll go make dinner.\" Dr. Lin seemed to be deliberately maintaining a calm relationship. Then, she walked into the kitchen.\n\nZhou Ze stood where he was, momentarily caught in a dilemma.\n\nHis mind was in turmoil.\n\n\"Hey, what are you standing there in a daze for? Go help.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law stretched out her foot and gave Zhou Ze's leg a light kick.\n\n*Not cherishing such a good opportunity to improve their relationship, just standing there like a dummy. What low emotional intelligence.*\n\nThe sister-in-law thought that this brother-in-law of hers was far worse than the boys at school who pursued her. He was practically a blockhead.\n\nZhou Ze finally walked into the kitchen.\n\nIn the kitchen, Dr. Lin had already tied on an apron and was chopping vegetables.\n\n\"It's okay, I can handle it myself. Go keep Xiao Yi company and watch TV,\" Dr. Lin said to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"There's something I want to ask you,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Hmm?\" Dr. Lin looked up, a little surprised. \"How about you ask after I'm done cooking this meal? I don't want to get distracted. To be honest, I rarely cook, so I'm afraid it won't be to your liking.\"\n\nWatching her carefully chopping the vegetables, so precise and methodical, Zhou Ze suddenly found that some words were very difficult to ask.\n\n\"I'll go to our room first. Come up in a bit.\"\n\n\"Okay. When the food is ready, I'll go up and call you down to eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the kitchen and went upstairs under his sister-in-law's surprised gaze.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze saw the large bed. He had slept in that bed, while Dr. Lin had slept on a pallet on the floor below.\n\nHe didn't really have much sentimental attachment to this place.\n\nLifting his head, he saw the wedding photo hanging on the wall above the bed.\n\nIn the wedding photo,\n\nthe two people in their wedding attire were standing a little far apart. The woman was poised and serene, the man shy and restrained. It was the wedding photo of Dr. Lin and Xu Le.\n\nA single wedding photo could actually reveal a lot of problems.\n\nAnd now,\n\nthe one who possessed the face of the man in the wedding photo,\n\nwas him.\n\nZhou Ze stared intently at that wedding photo.\n\nIf this entire affair, including the course of the murders, had been instigated by Dr. Lin from behind the scenes, if she had been watching from above the whole time, with complete insight...\n\nThen,\n\nthe previous Xu Le,\n\nthe Xu Le who had lain alone in this big bed every night,\n\nwhat kind of role had he truly been playing?\n\nHe was like a ball of dough, a ball of dough that had finally mustered a madness and courage rarely seen in his lifetime,\n\nbut in the end,\n\nall his actions had actually been seen by his wife, who treated him like a string puppet,\n\nwatching him take one step forward after another.\n\nEven to the point that, in the end, she personally cleaned up the traces,\n\nthe people who were supposed to die were all dead,\n\nXu Le was dead too,\n\nand moreover,\n\neven his body had been swept clean and vacated,\n\nall just to welcome the arrival of a soul she desired.\n\nHis vision seemed to blur at that moment,\n\nas if Zhou Ze could see,\n\nin the wedding photo on the wall,\n\nfrom Xu Le's eyes,\n\ntwo streams of bloody tears,\n\nslowly trickling down...\n\n---\n¹Footnote: 灯下黑 (dēng xià hēi), literally \"darkness under the lamp,\" an idiom for a blind spot or a place that's overlooked because of its proximity.",

    "content": "\"Hey, Xu Le, dinner's ready!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law stood at the foot of the stairs, yelling up.\n\nThe shout jolted Zhou Ze from his recent trance.\n\nThe bedroom was still the same bedroom.\n\nThe bed was still the same bed.\n\nThe wedding photo on the wall was the same as ever, without the slightest change.\n\nHe raised a hand and rubbed his eyes. Zhou Ze turned, pushed open the bedroom door, and walked downstairs.\n\nOn the dining table in the living room were three dishes and a soup.\n\nThere was celery stir-fried with beef, a plate of Kung Pao chicken, cabbage stir-fried with cellophane noodles, and a bowl of vegetable and tofu soup.\n\nDr. Lin was standing by the table, scooping rice into bowls. The sister-in-law was already seated, waiting impatiently.\n\n\"Some people have no conscience. Their wife is in the kitchen cooking while they're just lounging around upstairs.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law rocked back and forth in her chair as she ate.\n\nZhou Ze sat down as well, and Dr. Lin placed a pair of chopsticks into his hands.\n\n\"From now on, come home for dinner,\" Dr. Lin said suddenly.\n\nLike a gentle wife admonishing her husband, as if everything was as it should be, as if everything was normal, a soft spring breeze washing over the land.\n\n\"Huh?\" The sister-in-law's eyes went wide.\n\n*Xu Le is coming back?*\n\n*And it's my sister who's personally asking him?*\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\nThe sister-in-law couldn't hold back anymore and kicked Zhou Ze under the table.\n\n*You idiot, why aren't you saying anything?*\n\n*My sister just asked you to come home for dinner!*\n\n*She's willing to make you noodles,¹*\n\n*And you're still not going to be more proactive?*\n\n\"We'll see,\" Zhou Ze said evasively.\n\n\"How about we move to that apartment complex?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n*That* apartment complex, of course, was the one Zhou Ze had lived in in his past life.\n\nClearly, Dr. Lin also knew that Zhou Ze living in her family's home and interacting with her parents was unpleasant for him. So, she was willing to move to that home with Zhou Ze.\n\nA place with just the two of them.\n\nThe chopsticks in Zhou Ze's hand trembled slightly. He could feel that this woman hadn't truly overcome the psychological barrier she had mentioned before, but she was trying hard to make herself look forward.\n\n*Life is already a muddle, so just let it continue being a muddle, and maybe make it a little better.*\n\nMany people yearn for a perfectly exquisite life, but a truly exquisite life doesn't exist, just as some glamorous female stars might have worked as bar hostesses in their youth.\n\nIf you scrutinize it, any perfect thing will have its flaws at some point in time.\n\nGrasping the present is the true meaning of life.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze hesitated.\n\nThere were some questions he didn't ask, because Dr. Lin had sent her sister to call him down instead of coming up herself. But admittedly, Zhou Ze himself was also a little afraid to ask that question.\n\nOnce they completely tore off the mask, the gift he had seen as heaven's compensation for him might, once stripped of all pretense, become something he couldn't bear to look at.\n\nZhou Ze admitted that, like most men, he liked beautiful women. It was just that this time, he was a little scared.\n\nIn his mind, he found it difficult to picture a scene of himself living with Dr. Lin in his own home, sitting at the dining table and eating together.\n\nThe feeling…\n\nIt was like he was a pet cat being doted on by its owner; every action, including his resistance, would just seem like a form of pouting.\n\n\"There's no need,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen he picked up a mouthful of food, his expression grave as he forced himself to swallow.\n\n\"Does it not taste good?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nShe could see that Zhou Ze looked pained as he ate.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, you're really putting on airs now, aren't you, Your Majesty!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law couldn't watch anymore.\n\nAs she saw it, Xu Le was bullying her sister.\n\nPutting down his chopsticks, Zhou Ze decided not to force himself to eat anymore. He turned to Dr. Lin and said, \"Come with me for a moment. We need to talk about something.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded and put down her chopsticks.\n\n\"Hey, what could you possibly have to say that you can't say in front of me!\" the sister-in-law huffed, feeling like a third wheel but lacking the self-awareness of one.\n\nZhou Ze went upstairs, and Dr. Lin followed.\n\nThe two of them stood at the second-floor bedroom doorway. Zhou Ze didn't push the door open to go inside; he didn't want to see that wedding photo again. He always felt that the Xu Le in the photo was watching him.\n\nAnd Xu Le…\n\nwas actually no different from him.\n\nThey were both tools.\n\nOne was a high-grade tool, the other a low-grade one.\n\nThere was no need for the pot to call the kettle black.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Dr. Lin said, looking at Zhou Ze with her head slightly lowered.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a long time. The words were on the tip of his tongue, but he didn't know how to say them.\n\nWas it an interrogation?\n\nA verification?\n\nA reprimand?\n\nA tirade?\n\nOr maybe, a mutual unburdening?\n\nIn the end, what was done was done.\n\nThe people who should be dead were dead.\n\nThe emptied body had been entered by him.\n\nThe matter, in fact, had already reached its conclusion.\n\n\"Let's just end it here,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze kept his eyes fixed on the woman before him.\n\nIt was as if this gentle, poised woman would, in the next moment, rip off all pretense, press him against the wall, and mock him for overestimating himself.\n\n*You're just my doll,*\n\n*My favorite toy.*\n\n*I went to so much trouble to get you.*\n\n*As a toy,*\n\n*Do you have the right to say it's over?*\n\nThe human imagination is the most terrifying instinct.\n\nIt contains so many psychological suggestions, just like the last time Zhou Ze was at Wang Ke's house.\n\nWhat kind of meat was Wang Ke really eating?\n\nWho knew?\n\nEven if he clearly analyzed the matter of psychological suggestion for you, was that being frank and open, or was it a clumsy attempt at a cover-up?\n\nIt was impossible to say for sure.\n\nJust like the scene before Zhou Ze's eyes right now.\n\nAfter hearing Zhou Ze's words, Dr. Lin just smiled and nodded. Zhou Ze saw her eyes redden slightly, as if with a kind of heartbreak. She had spent a great, great deal of time adjusting her emotions, trying to come to terms with things.\n\nAt the dinner table just now, she had decided to cast off her previous burdens and try to be with Zhou Ze, but Zhou Ze had refused. And immediately after, she heard Zhou Ze's true words of breakup.\n\nShe had lost her legal husband, even though her husband was still alive. She had lost the man she liked, because the man she liked said he no longer wanted to continue this bond.\n\nShe was like a lone boat, tossed about endlessly by the waves.\n\nListening to her parents, listening to her family, listening to Zhou Ze, listening to her mentor—she lived resiliently, and she was very resilient.\n\nFate had played a trick on her.\n\nSome things, you could be obsessed with, pursue, and overcome, but in the end, you would still miss out.\n\n\"I'll bring the divorce papers tomorrow. You'll agree, right?\" Zhou Ze asked, watching Dr. Lin.\n\nHe was like a tourist watching a tiger in a zoo from behind a fence.\n\nIt was a very complicated emotion.\n\nAs long as she didn't reveal her true face, this complexity would continue to exist in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nAfter all, this was a society that values looks.\n\nAnd she was so beautiful.\n\nRight?\n\nWhen he slapped Xu Dachuan, with that wrinkly face of his, he felt no psychological pressure at all.\n\nBut if you asked Zhou Ze to take something and hit Dr. Lin right now…\n\nHe really couldn't bring himself to do it.\n\n\"Fine. Let's get a divorce.\" Dr. Lin looked up at Zhou Ze. \"You can start your new life, too.\"\n\n*You agreed?*\n\n*You really agreed?*\n\n*You really, really agreed?*\n\nZhou Ze stared at Dr. Lin, afraid that in the next instant, she would snap, lash out at him, and tell him that a toy should know its place as a toy!\n\nBut all of Dr. Lin's reactions seemed so natural, so natural that Zhou Ze found it a little unreal.\n\n*Is she the director,*\n\n*and at the same time,*\n\n*also the actor?*\n\n\"Xu Le is dead,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Did you have anything to do with it?\"\n\nWhat had to be asked, eventually had to be asked.\n\nDr. Lin nodded.\n\nIn her eyes, fate seemed to be a game that toyed with people. It was her obsession that had brewed this tragedy.\n\n\"Actually, maybe this was all my fault. It was my fanciful thinking that led fate to play such a joke.\n\nYou're right.\n\nNow is the time for the joke to end.\"\n\n\"Sis, are you crying?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law came up the stairs just then and saw her sister crying.\n\n\"It's nothing. Dust got in my eye.\"\n\nDr. Lin didn't want her sister to see her like this. She pushed open the bedroom door and went inside. The sister-in-law shot Zhou Ze a glare and followed her sister into the bedroom.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh.\n\nAt that moment, he felt a sense of relief, as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders.\n\nShe had admitted it.\n\nShe had also agreed to end it.\n\n*If it's over, then it's over.*\n\nHe couldn't go back to his past life anyway. The people who should be dead were all dead, except for this woman.\n\nBut asking himself honestly, if he were truly given the chance to kill her, could he really bring himself to do it?\n\nAnd would the purpose of killing her be merely to vent his anger?\n\nHe walked into the bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze scooped up a handful of water and splashed it on his face.\n\nThe cold shock helped clear his head a little.\n\n*It's over.*\n\n*It's over.*\n\n*It's finally over.*\n\nHe would return to the bookstore in a bit, ignore all the trouble this \"Xu Le\" identity had brought him, and get ready to live his own life.\n\nBecome a Ghost Emissary.\n\nGet officially promoted.\n\nIn his past life, he could climb the ladder step by step as a doctor.\n\nIn this life, it was simply a different environment, but the same kind of workplace.\n\nHe looked up.\n\nZhou Ze saw in the mirror that there was someone else standing behind him.\n\nIt was the sister-in-law.\n\n\"You made my sister cry. She's crying her heart out.\"\n\n\"Things here are complicated. It's not something a kid like you can understand.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up a towel and began drying his face.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze froze.\n\nHe stopped all movement.\n\nHe saw the sister-in-law in the mirror.\n\nHer head was bent to the left at an extremely exaggerated angle, an angle a normal person could never achieve.\n\nHer face was pressed tightly against her left shoulder, her entire head tilted a perfect ninety degrees, but her body was still standing perfectly straight.\n\n\"I know my sister likes you.\n\nI know my sister doesn't like Xu Le.\n\nI know my sister didn't want to hurt our parents, didn't want to destroy this marriage.\n\nSo to make my sister happy,\n\nI made Xu Le die.\n\nI made you die and come back.\n\nI turned you into Xu Le.\n\nI did all this, and my sister should have been happy.\n\nBut you…\n\nyou went and made her sad again.\n\nHeh heh…\"\n\n***\n\n¹A common Chinese expression for a wife's domestic care.",

In the bedroom, Dr. Lin, who was crying in the bedroom, was lying on the bed at this time, with his willow eyebrows slightly frowning and he was already asleep, but between his eyebrows, it seemed as if there was a black aperture cover.\n\n\n\nShe doesn't want to sleep, she has to sleep\n\n\n\nHer sister doesn't want to surprise her next thing\n\n\n\nAnd in the sanitation room separated by a wall, Zhou Ze continued to hold a towel in his hand;\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law stood straight and kept staring at him\n\n\n\nPainting style,\n\n\n\nAt this time, it seemed to solidify, and it was so heavy that it seemed that the ink on the ink painting was severe that it had begun to drip out.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze never thought it would be her, he really never thought it would be\n\n\n\nIn Zhou Ze's opinion, she was just a child who was not very experienced in the world, with a little bit of praise and a little naive. In addition, she had been in this sanitary room before, but she was shocked by the backlash she suffered when she was rescued in the hospital because she opened her door and encountered her backlash.\n\n\n\nIf this is also a kind of acting,\n\n\n\nIt's too hard\n\n\n\nMoreover, the reason she said seems to be very valid, but in fact, it is very strong. Of course, some people's brains may be such a strange and unique way.\n\n\n\nShe only has her own unique world view, only cares about her own feelings, only knows what she knows,\n\n\n\nIn this world,\n\n\n\nIs there 700 million people or only one person? For her, there is no difference\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law began to move forward.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was the gift she gave to her sister, a gift to tease her sister for fun. Now, this gift has made her sister even more worried.\n\n\n\nAs a gift, he was unqualified\n\n\n\nUnqualified things,\n\n\n\nYou have to abandon it.\n\n\n\nIt will be sold out.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't need to continue to exist\n\n\n\nZhou Ze put down the towel, and the black nails slowly grew out between his ten fingers.\n\n\n\n\"Buzz\"\n\n\n\nA sound of a silence is transmitted,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze only felt a stinging sensation in his eardrum, and his vision was blurred. Then, the skewed face had already appeared in front of him.\n\n\n\nShe looked at herself with her head tilted, carrying the girl's innocence, and leaving her cute and innocent true nature that she had not yet lost.\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\nThe clothes on the chest were cracked, Zhou Ze flew backwards, smashing the lens behind him, and a bloody wound appeared on his chest, and blood flowed out.\n\n\n\n\"Why can't you go through it well?\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law muttered,\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nA crisp sound appeared on Zhou Ze's body again. If Zhou Ze hadn't thoughtfully crossed his body, his neck might have fallen down, but that's the case. A clear bloody mouth appeared at the neck.\n\n\n\n\"Why can't we be together well\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law smiled at the corner of her mouth.\n\n\n\nShe seemed to be asking Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nIt also seems like asking myself,\n\n\n\nBut the essence is the same.\n\n\n\nThat's why she didn't prepare for any answers\n\n\n\n\"You are a ghost messenger.\" Zhou Ze couldn't understand, \"If you are a ghost messenger, how could you kill so many people at will?\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law didn't care, but the smile on the corner of her mouth became even more depressed\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's pupils shrank, and his body turned out to the front side. The washbasin behind him and all the glass in the sanitation room burst open at this time.\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\nAll around, there were glass fragments shot out from scratch, making this narrow and beautiful place suddenly\n\n\n\nBlood dance,\n\n\n\n  Glass is a mess,\n\n\n\nThis is a perfect spot for taking wedding photos.\n\n\n\nAs long as the bride is not afraid of being destroyed\n\n\n\n\"You, why are there so many things?\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law starts her hand,\n\n\n\nIt was at this time,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze also stretched out his hand.\n\n\n\nThe black nails of the squid pierced directly into the palm of my sister-in-law\n\n\n\nHowever, the original nails of Fengqi suddenly became \"soft fingers\" at this time. My sister-in-law's palm skin could be broken by blowing, but Zhou Ze's nails could not be stabbed at all.\n\n\n\n\"You can't let me save you some fun\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law grabbed her fingers, and to the outsiders, she was directly clasped with Zhou Ze’s fingers.\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt a heartache,\n\n\n\nTen fingers are connected to the heart,\n\n\n\nNow Zhou Ze's nail cover is slowly turning away, just like someone holding a carpet to pull your nails. The pain that runs deep in the soul makes people look desperate, completely beyond the boundaries of physical torture.\n\n\n\n  For a long time, Zhou Cheng came, his unfavorable nails finally lost their former power in front of his sister-in-law.\n\n\n\nThe smile on the corner of my sister-in-law's mouth became even more depressed.\n\n\n\n\"I actually used the things I gave you to deal with me.\"\n\n\n\nNext moment,\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law's fingertips also had long black nails, and they directly pierced into Zhou Ze's palm.\n\n\n\nFirst, the pain of nails leaving the body, then the torture of the nails being stabbed into the body.\n\n\n\nThis kind of punishment that was previously imposed on others by himself, but now it has fallen on Zhou Ze himself for the first time\n\n\n\n\"I'm right, it's you who are wrong.\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law continued to murmur and pushed Zhou Ze forward\n\n\n\n\"Why are you not doing well?\"\n\n\n\n\"Buzz\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was swept out and hit the wall. His five fingers on his right hand were covered in blood and flesh. There were five nail pierced nail pierced eyes, which were shocked.\n\n\n\n\"I have paid so much thought, why can't you live a good life...\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law kept asking herself.\n\n\n\nLike a curious baby,\n\n\n\nBut her image at this time is really unacceptable\n\n\n\n\"Click...\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law raised her arm,\n\n\n\nShe is still half a meter away from Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze felt as if a hand had already pinched his neck and lifted him up. The tingling and anxiety in the neck was so clear, and he could no longer breathe.\n\n\n\nThe two feet have left the ground, and I am like a prisoner who is being stolen, waiting for the judgment of the fate in front of me.\n\n\n\n  Currently\n\n\n\n  Smile, \n\n\n\n\"Who is it again that gives you courage and makes you dare to come and ask after knowing the shadow behind the matter\n\n\n\nYou are just a puppet controlled in my palm.\n\n\n\nWho gave you the fantasy of resisting?\n\n\n\n\"Amount........................\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze wanted to make some sounds and talk, but because his neck was stuck tightly, Zhou Ze couldn't make any clear sounds at all.\n\n\n\nAs a death row prisoner,\n\n\n\nYour power to finally speak has been slandered\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law is asking questions, but she has no qualifications to answer you\n\n\n\n\"Lin Jing, I did everything I could, but this game is really not that fun.\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law said to herself,\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nShe changed to another direction.\n\n\n\n  continue,\n\n\n\n  Cross\n\n\n\n\"Your sister is still not happy, your sister is so upset.\"\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nShe was in a different direction again,\n\n\n\n\"After we killed him, we would kill your sister, and we would not be worried.\n\n\n\nYes?”\n\n\n\nZhou Ze only felt that the power of his neck suddenly increased.\n\n\n\nThat terrifying suffocation came like a sky and a tide.\n\n\n\nThe lungs were burning and almost bursting\n\n\n\nHis eyes began to turn white, and his body's destruction could not be restrained. This is a sign of death and a warning to the body's death.\n\n\n\nAnd the sister-in-law in front kept changing directions and tilting her head ninety degrees, talking to herself, as if communicating with another person.\n\n\n\nIt was like two little girls carrying Peppa's shoulder bags standing together in front of the doll grabbing machine.\n\n\n\nDiscussing which doll to catch,\n\n\n\nWhich doll is easy to catch?\n\n\n\nWhich doll looks more cute?\n\n\n\n\"Cough cough...............................\"\n\n\n\nCough sounds are coming,\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law raised her head unexpectedly and looked at Zhou Ze above.\n\n\n\nShe was a little surprised.\n\n\n\nNot dead yet\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nThe smile on her face slowly became solemn.\n\n\n\n\"What's going on with you\"\n\n\n\n  Yes,\n\n\n\nWhat's going on with you\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's eyes began to glow green, and the ancient copper-colored light on his body began to slowly radiate out. The nails that had been pulled out before with their right hand actually grew out again.\n\n\n\nThis time, there was no blackness as before, but the color of a year old man was revealed.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's lips opened,\n\n\n\nThe two fangs slowly exposed,\n\n\n\nGreen-faced and fangs,\n\n\n\n The terrifying sunshine brings the breath of people hating ghosts\n\n\n\nThe force that had originally bound Zhou Ze's neck suddenly dissipated at this time. Zhou Ze slowly landed on the ground, squatted down, and held the broken porcelain brick with his hand, and then slowly lifted his head.\n\n\n\nThe two demonic green eyes stared at the crooked sister-in-law in front of her\n\n\n\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\n\n\nShe was confused,\n\n\n\nThe toys she made, or the gifts she chose to pack and give to her sister, actually changed unexpectedly.\n\n\n\nA change that she had unexpectedly expected\n\n\n\n  \"ah…………\"\n\n\n\nSha Li's voice came from Zhou Ze's throat. His arms slowly opened, and the whole person slowly stood up.\n\n\n\nVery slow,\n\n\n\nBut it's very sure.\n\n\n\nLike last time,\n\n\n\nHalf of Zhou Ze's skin appeared in ancient copper color, and most of the skin began to break and crack, and the blood began to flow out slowly.\n\n\n\nThe sister-in-law, who was tilted, watched Zhou Ze walk towards him step by step.\n\n\n\nShe was a little confused.\n\n\n\nAlso a little at a loss.\n\n\n\n\"You are Zhou Ze\"\n\n\n\nThis time, my sister-in-law needed Zhou Ze's answer.\n\n\n\nNow, Zhou Ze has to give her any answer\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law stretched out her hand, but Zhou Ze was not swept out this time. He walked forward step by step,\n\n\n\nThat's it,\n\n\n\nWalked in front of her\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law's nails stabbed Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\n\n\"Puff\"\n\n\n\nThe nails pierced in.\n\n\n\n  However,\n\n\n\nThe nails just pierced into the skin. When they were engraved, the muscles at the wound position began to instantly retract, fixing my sister-in-law's nails tightly in the body.\n\n\n\nShe wants to pull it out,\n\n\n\nI can't pull it out at all.\n\n\n\nIt seems that there are countless small mouths sucking their nails inside.\n\n\n\nVery tight,\n\n\n\nVery stressful\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law looked at Zhou Ze and looked at her green eyes. A hint of enlightenment appeared on her face and murmured:\n\n\n\n\"You...you were actually dead before...\"\n\n\n\nAnd Zhou Ze stretched out his hand,\n\n\n\nGrasped my sister-in-law's brain.\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law wants to resist, but she cannot resist\"Click click...\"\n\n\n\nLike the friction sound of the bones moving slowly,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze grabbed his sister-in-law's brain with his hand.\n\n\n\nNo slap,\n\n\n\nNo piercing,\n\n\n\nInstead, slowly tilted her face,\n\n\n\n  Reply and return\n\n\n\nHuh,\n\n\n\nThe face is straight,\n\n\n\nLooks like,\n\n\n\nIt's much more comfortable",

    "content": "Two faces,\n\n\n\n  Conversation,\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law wanted to resist, but her face was under Zhou Ze's palm, and she had no room for resistance.\n\n\n\nAt this moment,\n\n\n\nShe felt the feeling of the Empress in Green on the rooftop\n\n\n\nYou have changed a lot, and you don’t even have any words\n\n\n\nThe zombie is a kind of existence born from death. The reason why he was hated by gods is because he is not in the original game rules, but a strange thing.\n\n\n\nJust like when everyone doesn’t cut the seeds, you have already cut the seeds.\n\n\n\nJust like when everyone has cut the seeds, you still have the seeds.\n\n\n\nUnlike everyone else, you will naturally be criticized and rejected\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\n\n\nThe two fangs were exposed, bringing a stern pressure\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law was browsing, her body was shaking, and she was also panic.\n\n\n\nThe game originally belonged to her was in a direction that she could not control, and even she had to be rolled into it. Now, it is impossible to unplug the power and turn off the game.\n\n\n\nShe didn't know what kind of freak she released, and she even believed that Zhou Ze herself might not know that he was actually a freak.\n\n\n\nThis is a beautiful misunderstanding, and it is also a landmine that catches people off guard.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately,\n\n\n\nShe stepped on it.\n\n\n\nAnd he also danced a Latin dance on the mine\n\n\n\nThe fangs slowly pressed down, and they had touched my sister-in-law's neck and skin.\n\n\n\nThat smooth skin,\n\n\n\nThat tender skin,\n\n\n\nCarrying the girl's spirit,\n\n\n\nThe breath of youth is nurtured,\n\n\n\nHow many boys are eager to have a love affair here,\n\n\n\nHow many boys are eager to leave their teeth marks here;\n\n\n\n\"I am her, she is me too.\"\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law opened her mouth,\n\n\n\n\"You bite me to death, she's dead too.\"\n\n\n\nThis is a threat,\n\n\n\nA forced threat,\n\n\n\nIf the situation had not been so critical that it was urgent, my sister-in-law would not have opened her mouth like this.\n\n\n\nBecause this is like lowering one's head from a toy and asking for a toy,\n\n\n\nShe has her own dignity.\n\n\n\nBut when his life is threatened, he suddenly becomes worthless.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment, and his green eyes swept on his sister-in-law's face with a demonic light, as if he was chanting, as if he was thinking, as if he was lying on the wall, as if he was lying on the wall.\n\n\n\n  then,\n\n\n\nHe raised his head, stretching the distance between his fangs and his skin a little further, and the previously suffocating pressure also faded a lot.\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law Chang sighed and felt a sense of escaping from death, which made her a little dazed\n\n\n\n  then,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly lowered his head again\n\n\n\n“Puff\"\n\n\n\nNo prelude,\n\n\n\nI don’t give you too much psychological preparation,\n\n\n\nIn this way, with dryness, shining, and thick,\n\n\n\nWith hardness,\n\n\n\nEnter directly\n\n\n\nThe previous action of lifting the head was more like a kind of playing, a kind of joking, a kind of desire to be motivated, and a kind of...**\n\n\n\nAs if said:\n\n\n\nI'm just rubbing outside and don't go in, don't worry,\n\n\n\n  then,\n\n\n\n  Suddenly entered\n\n\n\nNot to be jealous,\n\n\n\nDon't know what Qingxi means\n\n\n\nThe fangs pierce,\n\n\n\nThe blood and fluid began to burst.\n\n\n\nThe human body will appear very fragile at this time\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law's head was still pressed by Zhou Ze with her hands. She showed a very painful expression on her face, and her eyes were deep, and panic and thrust;\n\n\n\nThe previous calmness has long been invisible\n\n\n\nBefore, she was in a sanitation room,\n\n\n\nOne side asks and answers,\n\n\n\nOne side forced Zhou Ze on the verge of the way.\n\n\n\n  now,\n\n\n\nIf you come out and get messed up, you will always have to go back\n\n\n\nIn fact, the slaughter does not eat people or drink human blood\n\n\n\nIn the early ancient novels, there was a lot of mention that slaughter eats people and eats human blood. In modern times, many of the knowledge about slaughter are slaughter movies from the Hong Kong film era. However, they were influenced by some European and American movies at that time, and these settings were added.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze did not suck the other party's blood. He just enjoyed this feeling. Through his fangs, he injected his will into the other party's body.\n\n\n\nThis is a swearing of ownership, this is the most direct report.\n\n\n\nLet your breathing be above the other side,\n\n\n\nTorturing her,\n\n\n\nBite her,\n\n\n\n  Put her something to herself,\n\n\n\nAs much as possible\n\n\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n\n\nA black gas suddenly rose from my sister-in-law, and these black gas slowly condensed into the figure of a woman in black.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the woman came out, the temperature around her began to decrease, and even white frost appeared\n\n\n\nYou can say that this is the special effects and schedule for the big boss’s appearance.\n\n\n\nBut in fact, this is a sign that a woman's soul power cannot be restrained from suffocation. She is like a piece of ice leaving the ice cabinet. Although it still dissipates the chill, it can't last long.\n\n\n\n\"Roar\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze removed his fangs, and the wound on his sister-in-law's neck was instantly scarred, and no drop of blood flowed out.\n\n\n\n  Relax open,\n\n\n\nMy sister-in-law's body fell directly to the ground.\n\n\n\nI fell so hard that I made a \"bang\" sound.\n\n\n\nThere is no need to worry about it, nor any concern,\n\n\n\nEven if this girl falls into a mentally retarded,\n\n\n\nIt is also related to Zhou Ze's unfilled hairThe woman's soul was slowly sluggishing. She seemed to want to enter this body again, but Zhou Ze was standing below and she didn't dare to go down.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a plaque was dancing beside the woman. It was a plaque that was exactly the same as Zhou Ze had. This plaque meant the identity of a woman.\n\n\n\nShe is also a ghost\n\n\n\nHowever, the woman's pen is almost white and broken, and even when she is dancing, debris are constantly falling off, which is obviously already unbearable.\n\n\n\n\"I'm a ghost mess, you can't kill me.\"\n\n\n\nThe woman said tremblingly that she was not afraid that Zhou Ze would be so cold, but that she felt that she was extremely cold.\n\n\n\nShe has left her body,\n\n\n\nJust like an ordinary person standing on the Nanyang Glacier with his clothes stripped away.\n\n\n\nThat kind of taste is really not something that can be resistant by spiritual willpower.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze raised his head,\n\n\n\nLooking at her,\n\n\n\nThe mouth opened slightly,\n\n\n\nIt seems like laughing,\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly,\n\n\n\n  Cross\n\n\n\nThe bones are constantly brittle,\n\n\n\nBut my head still fell down.\n\n\n\nMocking,\n\n\n\nThe most direct ridicule\n\n\n\nThe woman slowly began to show her blue flames, her soul was melting into ice and gradually losing its vitality. She was very cold and urgently needed a warm Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nShe couldn't wait and had no choice but to wait any longer\n\n\n\nBiu\n\n\n\nShe looked downward and tried to enter her sister-in-law's body again\n\n\n\n\"Roar\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze danced with his arms, and his nails, which were not as transparent as before, but looked more mulberry-like, directly hit the woman. The woman let out a sound of slap, and was finally caught by Zhou Ze and held in front of him.\n\n \n\nA woman's waist is really something that can be held with only one hand. It is not about how good and proud a woman's figure is, but about the woman's soul being constantly ravaged and turned around under the palm of Zhou Ze's hand.\n\n\n\n\"Let me go, I'm a ghost messenger\"\n\n\n\nThe woman roared\n\n\n\nZhou Ze spoke loudly.\n\n\n\nThen the palm of your hand began to send to your mouth.\n\n\n\nThe woman's stomp and roar became even more intense. She had already felt what was about to happen. At the same time, she also understood that the man in front of her had lost all his mind. Now he was just acting on an instinct.\n\n\n\nHe's tired,\n\n\n\nHis body hurts very much.\n\n\n\nHis body is very old.\n\n\n\nJust like a person who is sick and needs to be repaired when he is injured.\n\n\n\nHe also needs to go in now\n\n\n\nThis body has no way to bear his current situation\n\n\n\n\"I am a ghost corps. No matter what I have done, only the sect can judge me. You can't, you can't\n\n\n\nYou have decided to bear this kind of price.\n\n\n\nYou wake me up,\n\n\n\nWake me up\"\n\n\n\nThis is just like the golden cudgel for Monkey Brother in \"The Westward Journey\". The desperate monster started to report to his home and let his Bodhisattvas or Immortals go back. This is revealing his backstage.\n\n\n\n  However,\n\n\n\nBefore that,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze is also a ghost mate. Although he is a temporary worker.\n\n\n\nBut the woman was still ready to kill him\n\n\n\nKill him, kill Dr. Lin again,\n\n\n\nAnother will in your body will not interfere with yourself anymore\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's hand stopped.\n\n\n\n  Unshering the other party’s soul to his mouth\n\n\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze, but she was still very nervous. With a previous teaching, she would no longer have the fantasy of escaping from the sky.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pinched the woman and started moving.\n\n\n\nEvery time his footsteps fell, a black mark that had lasted for a long time was left on the floor. He walked down the building and came to the kitchen.\n\n\n\nGreen pupils were surfing in the kitchen.\n\n\n\n  then,\n\n\n\nHe found it,\n\n\n\nA can of old mother\n\n\n\nHe crushed the jar and left all the spicy sauce in his hand.\n\n\n\nFirst, put the spicy sauce into your mouth.\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze once again held the hand that grabbed the woman.\n\n\n\nOpen your mouth,\n\n\n\n  Send the woman’s soul into her mouth\n\n\n\nThe woman’s final cry and curse,\n\n\n\nIt seems that the lyrical music played in the surrounding music during meals brings a different kind of emotion to people's meals.\n\n\n\nAfter swallowing it into the abdomen,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze held his arms open,\n\n\n\n\"Himmer......\"\n\n\n\nA heavy burp rises,\n\n\n\nI was convinced,\n\n\n\nSatisfied,\n\n\n\n  Food,\n\n\n\nBut I really want to eat another one\n\n\n\n …………………\n\n\n\n\"Why didn't you say it earlier?\"\n\n\n\nWhite jeans stroll in the car\n\n\n\nTang Fan did not pay attention to the girl who was approaching the rampage, but continued to open the big white rabbit milk candy and put it into his mouth.\n\n\n\n\"He didn't ask any questions before and was not interested\n\n\n\n  and,\n\n\n\nHow did I know that another ghost in Tongcheng is actually at his wife's house?\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, aunties, here, here\"\n\n\n\nThe old man is still a driver,\n\n\n\nAfter he returned to the bookstore, he talked about Zhou Ze's journey.\n\n\n\nLet Tang Pen hear it,\n\n\n\nThen this secret that was not a secret was made public, and then the phone that hit Zhou Cheng could not be connected, so everyone came here\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang sat in the secondary driving position, his face calmThe car stopped,\n\n\n\nThe crowd got off the car and walked in.\n\n\n\nWhite jeans are walking in the first place,\n\n\n\nWhen she walked to the intersection of the building,\n\n\n\nBai Bao Bao suddenly stopped walking.\n\n\n\nShe felt a familiar atmosphere far ahead, as if the evil spirits in her body were caused by this and began to get angry.\n\n\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\"\n\n\n\nTang Pope saw that Bai Baobao would not leave and asked\n\n\n\nWhite jeans bite their lips tightly.\n\n\n\nThe breath that came in was becoming more and more obvious, and it seemed to have increased to a peak, which was clearer and more exciting than before.\n\n\n\nThe connection between this bloodstain and the tribe's zodiac was like a series of currents flowing continuously on her body.\n\n\n\nShe subconsciously clamped her legs tightly.\n\n\n\n Kao said:\n\n\n\n\"Suddenly,\n\n\n\nVery cruel”",

    "content": "*Ding dong…*\n\nIt was like the sound of a stone dropping into water—crisp and pleasant. The original tranquility rippled in its wake.\n\nZhou Ze found himself lying on a pool of water. Beneath him was the surface, and this surface was like glass, bearing the weight of his body.\n\nEverything around him was blurry at first, but it gradually sharpened into focus. And once it was clear, it was familiar.\n\nIn the distance, the Yellow Springs Road was, as always, bustling with traffic. For even without a world war or a plague, people in this world are dying at every moment.\n\nThere’s a common line in many TV dramas: *I’m afraid you’ll be too lonely on the Yellow Springs Road, so I’ll (or I’ll send someone to) go down and keep you company.*\n\nIn reality, there’s no need to worry about that.\n\nWhen you go down, you’ll find the Yellow Springs Road is very crowded. And you’ll find yourself surrounded by white brothers, black brothers, men and women, old and young. They are all there.\n\nWhether plump and curvy or slender and graceful, handsome and dashing or ugly and unsightly—such outward appearances cannot stop the established rule that you will die.\n\nKings and generals may rise in glory, but in the end, it’s all just a single earthen mound.\n\nHowever, most people who descend to the Yellow Springs can't perceive loneliness. They are all like soulless walking corpses, inching forward with the great stream.\n\nIf the mortal world is a factory workshop, then Hell is the subsequent factory for waste collection and material conversion. Compared to the dazzling chaos of the mortal world, Hell is more concerned with a kind of rule and order.\n\nAn order that would make you despair, make you feel helpless, yet was as unyielding as iron.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up.\n\n*This is a dream, right?*\n\n*I… I shouldn't be dead.*\n\nThere weren't many memories in his mind. He only remembered nearly dying in front of his sister-in-law, and then, as if he'd gotten drunk, he blacked out again.\n\nIt was just like the last time on the rooftop, as if he had surrendered his body, surrendered everything.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to die, especially not now. If he could choose, Zhou Ze would rather be like those \"walking corpses,\" continuing on numbly, walking to the next endpoint or starting point.\n\nBut now, he wasn't numb, nor was he in a daze. If he were dead, he would have to endure the torment of this utter loneliness with a clear mind.\n\nIt was like undergoing a massive, protracted surgery,\n\nand the doctor tells you,\n\n\"Sorry, we're out of anesthesia.\"\n\nHis palm pressed against the pool's surface.\n\nThe pool was empty; he could see straight to the bottom and all around, for it was crystal clear.\n\nThe Faceless Woman had not yet returned, but things over there were about to reach a conclusion.\n\nThe little loli, the Faceless Woman, Rongcheng—there had to be an outcome eventually.\n\nGlancing around, Zhou Ze didn't see the man with the cat he had met during his last dream visit. In fact, Zhou Ze had been rather looking forward to seeing him again.\n\nFor some reason, that man seemed to possess a special magic. Being with him made one feel at ease.\n\nPerhaps this was personal charisma?\n\nAs he walked on the water's surface, a mist began to rise around him. A hazy, dreamlike feeling slowly crept in, gradually enveloping everything.\n\nRevisiting an old place, there were no surprises, no accidents. Nothing seemed to have changed, but Zhou Ze knew something had. It seemed to be him.\n\nFor example, this time, returning here in a dream, he seemed much more composed.\n\nWhen the thick fog had completely shrouded everything,\n\nZhou Ze felt a sharp pain in his eyes. Then, he smelled the raw scent of soil.\n\n*Damn it.*\n\n*This smell of dirt again.*\n\nOpening his eyes, Zhou Ze saw he was lying in the bedroom on the second floor of the bookstore. The old Taoist and that monkey were sitting there, playing with mud, and then starting to smear it on his body.\n\n\"Heh heh, this is the right way to sculpt. Watch carefully, I'll give him a big pectoral muscle!\"\n\nThe old Taoist boasted to the monkey as he kneaded a mud bun, preparing to stick it onto Zhou Ze.\n\nOnly the old Taoist could turn healing into such a vulgar game.\n\nHowever, just as the old Taoist was about to stick it on, he saw that Zhou Ze on the bed had actually opened his eyes. He froze in shock, then held the mud bun in his hands, somewhat at a loss.\n\n\"Is it tasty?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nFor some reason, this injury felt much lighter than the last one. Although he didn't know how long he had been unconscious, at least he could speak immediately after waking up.\n\n*Is it tasty?*\n\nThe old Taoist remained frozen in place.\n\n\"Is it tasty?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe old Taoist, his face a mask of misery, lowered his head and took a bite of the earthen bun. Then, with tears in his eyes, he nodded.\n\n\"Delicious. Really delicious.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his face away, not looking at him anymore.\n\nThe old Taoist quickly spat out the dirt in his mouth and said fawningly, \"Boss, you're awake! You really scared me. You were in a coma for three days.\"\n\n*Only three days?*\n\n*How long was I out last time?*\n\n*But why do they have to smear mud all over me every time?*\n\nZhou Ze looked at the filthy stains on the bed and the dirt all over his body. For someone with mysophobia, it was truly unbearable.\n\n\"Get Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"Boss, are you hungry?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"I want to take a bath.\"\n\n\"Let me help you wash, Boss! Back when I went to bathhouses to catch ghosts and save the common folk, I used to work as a back-scrubber. My skills are top-notch!\"\n\nThe old Taoist patted his chest.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nBeside them, the monkey covered its mouth and giggled, \"Squeak squeak squeak.\"\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say, *See, even the monkey is laughing at you.*\n\n*How can you be so utterly clueless right now?*\n\n\"Get Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"No need, Boss. Come on, I'll carry you to the bathroom. I promise I'll scrub you till you're fair and tender.\"\n\nWith that, the old Taoist eagerly prepared to lift Zhou Ze out of bed.\n\nIf Zhou Ze had any strength right now, his nails would have probably shot out,\n\nand he would have carved several new air vents in the old Taoist's body.\n\nUnfortunately, the current Zhou Ze was just a frail patient.\n\nFortunately, Bai Yingying happened to push the door open at that moment, carrying a cup of tea. Seeing Zhou Ze awake, she delightedly put the things down and walked to the bedside.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief.\n\n...\n\nHaving learned from last time, Bai Yingying was much more natural helping Zhou Ze with his bath.\n\n\"What happened with the Lin family?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, when we got there, you were already unconscious on the floor. The Lin sisters were mostly fine, but their house was a total mess, especially the bathroom. The glass and tiles were all shattered. We got you out of there. Afterwards, no one from the Lin family came by to ask anything. I know what you want to ask—the younger Lin sister is back in school, and Dr. Lin has gone back to work.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Looking in the mirror, he saw his hair seemed a bit long. He said to Bai Yingying, \"Help me trim my hair, a little shorter.\"\n\n\"You got it.\"\n\nBai Yingying went out to get a pair of scissors and came back to cut Zhou Ze's hair.\n\nAfter everything was neat and tidy, Zhou Ze was placed in a wheelchair. The wheelchair was new, shiny and bright, and it was electric, with a joystick, like a bumper car at an amusement park.\n\n\"Who bought this?\" Zhou Ze's face darkened.\n\n\"Boss, do you like it? I specially prepared this for you. I figured you'd probably be using it often from now on, so I just went ahead and got you one. Boss, look here, you can press this button!\"\n\nThe old Taoist, as if showing off a treasure, pressed the button for Zhou Ze.\n\nThen the entire wheelchair began to light up, with multicolored lights,\n\n\"*Wooo wooo wooo wooo wooo*.\"\n\nAnd there was a train whistle sound effect.\n\nThe old Taoist thought Zhou Ze would surely be very satisfied.\n\nLittle did he know, if Zhou Ze's body weren't so weak right now, he would have been dead twice over by now.\n\nChoosing not to use the wheelchair, Zhou Ze sat down in a soft armchair by the bookstore window.\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't in the shop; it seemed something had come up with his family and he had gone home. But he had left behind a lot of juices and broths, saying they were for Zhou Ze to have when he woke up.\n\nLife, it seemed, had returned to its familiar rhythm.\n\nAfter all that trouble, in the end, nothing had changed.\n\nThe truth was laughable, yet it had truly happened.\n\nPerhaps, the matter of the ghost messenger's soul on his sister-in-law could only be truly understood when the little loli returned. As a ghost messenger who used to be in the same city, it was impossible that the little loli knew nothing about that other one.\n\nOf course, that was all on the premise that the little loli could still come back.\n\nZhou Ze, the boss, leaned back on the sofa, basking in the sun through the glass. Bai Yingying was in charge of serving the customers. Although Xu Qinglang wasn't there, Bai Yingying had already learned how to prepare the simple pastries and drinks.\n\nAt the table next to Zhou Ze sat two women with long hair, but their voices were a bit hoarse and affected. The two women were chatting while flipping through fashion magazines, and their conversation was getting more and more animated.\n\n\"Let me tell you, I recently discovered something that's really worrying me.\"\n\n\"What is it? Tell me, quick.\"\n\n\"Last week, I noticed that the stockings and bra I left on top of the washing machine in my bathroom, waiting to be washed, had been touched.\"\n\n\"Ah, who touched them? Did someone break into your house? Could it be a burglar?\"\n\n\"But nothing was stolen from the house. At first, I thought it was a burglar too, but it turns out it wasn't.\"\n\n\"Then who touched them?\"\n\n\"It was Xiaowen. I noticed that time, it was Xiaowen. After I finished showering, he went into the bathroom, and when I went back in, I found my stockings, bra, and other underwear had been rummaged through. There were even wet marks on them.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nThe other woman covered her mouth.\n\n\"How could Xiaowen do something like that?\"\n\n\"I'm very troubled by it too.\"\n\n\"It's okay, maybe Xiaowen is just growing up and has developed a little curiosity about women's things. Most boys go through this phase.\"\n\n\"I've looked it up online. If it were just these issues, I could let it go.\"\n\n\"Let it go? You can't let it go. You have to try to guide him and help him establish proper values.\"\n\n\"I was originally planning to have a frank talk with him, but then I discovered something else. One weekend, I got off work early and came home to find Xiaowen in my bedroom, wearing my everyday stockings, bra, and skirt, looking at himself in the mirror.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\n\"If it was just the earlier stuff, I could let it go. I felt I could still guide him a bit. But now things have gotten very serious. He's actually wearing my clothes and looking in the mirror. This is clearly not just a problem of a boy's puberty.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's my son's call. I'll take this.\"\n\nThe woman answered the phone, then said to her friend, \"Sorry, my son said he's hungry. I have to go back and feed him.\"\n\n\"Okay, you go on back.\"\n\n\"Waitress, the bill.\"\n\nBai Yingying walked over and settled the bill.\n\nZhou Ze watched the two long-haired women walk out of the store, lost in thought.\n\n\"Boss, would you like some more hot water?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"No need.\" Zhou Ze shook his head and picked up his teacup.\n\nBai Yingying stood with one hand on her hip, holding the money in the other, and said helplessly,\n\n\"Those two guys just now are seriously messed up, right? They're clearly men, but they dress themselves up like women. Good thing this old lady's eyes are sharp as a hawk's.\"\n\n\"*Cough cough...*\"\n\nZhou Ze, who was taking a sip of water, choked violently.",
