    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head, looking at himself in the mirror. He looked slightly haggard; as an Emergency Department doctor, this haggardness seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. Looks like they fell from a building, not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the entrance of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there,\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out a tissue to wipe off the water droplets and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an elder man in a grey Tang suit. The elder coughed incessantly, spitting out bloody foam and fragments of spleen tissue from time to time; his entire body was covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition. At the same time, he shouted to the people ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quick!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very poor.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe elder opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these kinds of words at this moment. Those who can truly face death calmly are, after all, a minority. And as a doctor, this is certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell them what percentage chance they have of surviving. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down... down... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Calm yourself down, relax. Your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist was hurting, Zhou Ze still didn't try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down there again... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately shouted.\n\nThe elder's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, his fingernails were black. It was a translucent black, like amber, not like dirt had accumulated inside;\n\nAnd at this moment, the elder's fingernails had already dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... Haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly straightened up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled. The hand that had been clutching Zhou Ze's wrist fell away, and he lost all movement.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe elder was pushed into the Emergency Room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitation measures on him. The defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me treat your wound.\" Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about such minor skin wounds. Their biggest concern was if the elder had other diseases, which could put the doctors in a dangerous situation of occupational exposure. After all, the elder had a lot of blood on his hands just now, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, if contracted even slightly, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the Emergency Room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone's spirits were somewhat low, but for them, such incidents were common, and they would soon adjust.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, get a check-up,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something else tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot and drove away.\n\nThe car had just driven under the Jianghai Avenue viaduct when Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now, please ask the children to wait for me a little longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other side quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green. Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator and drove through.\n\n\"HONK!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAnd at this very moment,\n\na heavy truck ran the red light and drove towards him. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look at the blinding high beams outside the car window,\n\nThen,\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly flung away by the heavy truck. After tumbling several times in the air, it crashed onto the ground.\n\n............\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze regained consciousness.\n\nHe found that his body was completely unable to move, as if it were stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional instinct, he really wanted to check his injuries right now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, there were occasional sounds of other vehicles driving past, and various horn sounds.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still inside the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe wail of police sirens came, along with the sound of fire engines.\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance reached Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature nearby was slightly high, they must be cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations, and was still clear on some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his car's trunk, and the Children's Day party for the orphanage children, would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief inwardly. At least he had saved his life. This could, for now, be considered an unexpected disaster.\n\nThere were also the voices of several nurses nearby, but because it was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, Doctor Chen's next sentence plunged Zhou Ze's heart into the abyss!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze sensed someone performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him. He felt each heavy compression, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the weeping of several nurses he knew.\n\nDoctor Chen punched a nearby car door, appearing very distraught.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nAbsolutely don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of suspended animation,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared frantically in his heart.\n\nBut next, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher; he must have been put into the ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, came the sound of the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses inside the ambulance compartment were still crying.\n\nBut this crying was exceptionally grating in Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy cry?!\n\nWhy are you crying?!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the voices of the hospital leaders:\n\n\"Little Zhou is just gone?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very serious. Doctor Zhou was excessively injured, lost too much blood, and has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone?\" Another vice president still didn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed relentlessly in his heart. At this very moment, these people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his leaders and elders.\n\nThey had actually declared him dead.\n\nBut can a dead person still hear sounds and perceive things?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nBeasts,\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The president said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it, a person, just like that, gone. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"The heavens have unforeseen storms, and people have unpredictable fortunes. Just try to be open-minded.\"\n\nAfter the two nurses finished speaking, they left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coolness,\n\nwas so distinct.\n\nZhou Ze struggled incessantly, constantly wanting to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like a ghost pressing on him[1]. No matter how hard he tried, his body was completely beyond his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair.\n\nHe was tired,\n\nand exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now.\n\nAt the hospital's,\n\nmorgue.\n\n...............\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he sensed a faint coolness on his face, and the stinging sensation was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" Someone asked from the side.\n\n\"Don't rush, wait a minute. He's been hit so badly, how could the makeup be done so quickly?\"\n\n\"The hospital is rushing us, they're about to send him to the memorial service.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it then?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed, and applied makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people; dead people naturally wouldn't feel pain, and they didn't have to worry about complaints. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nenduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush pressing down repeatedly on his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed into clothes. Immediately after, he was pushed out. The hospital attendants lifted and placed him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nmust be a freezer coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly isolated.\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nswaying,\n\njolting...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again; the freezer coffin lid must have been opened.\n\nWhat entered his ears,\n\nwas funeral music.\n\nThe president was speaking into a microphone. He was praising him, lamenting his loss,\n\nThen came the vice president and department heads, and so on.\n\nAround him,\n\nthere were occasional sounds of footsteps.\n\nSome simply walked by quietly, taking one last look at him.\n\nOthers tried to call out to him a few times, their voices choked with sobs.\n\nThis was a viewing of the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nmy remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart.\n\nHe started trying to struggle again,\n\nbut still couldn't.\n\nHe could only hear and feel,\n\nbut couldn't speak,\n\nor open his eyes.\n\nEveryone thought he was dead.\n\nBut he knew clearly.\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying beside him.\n\nThey cried very sincerely, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who had grown up in an orphanage. Because of this, after starting work, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident also happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage that night to celebrate Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but your compensation will be given to the orphanage, so rest assured.\" The vice president said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nAfterwards,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again; the freezer coffin lid must have been closed again.\n\nThen came another bout of jolting,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe freezer coffin lid was opened again.\n\nIt was somewhat quiet all around, with occasional human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and the other his legs, lifted him up, and then placed him on another cold rack, which seemed to be a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, there were faint, sporadic sounds of crying.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't at first discern where he had been taken to this time.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nhe suddenly understood.\n\nBastards!\n\nThey had sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou beasts,\n\nBastards!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was losing his mind the most, and it was the most frenzied he had ever been.\n\nHe knew,\n\nonce he was cremated,\n\nthere would be no room left for anything!\n\nHe would directly face death!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty, he hadn't started a family, he didn't have children yet, he still had his life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw this uncle's hand move a little.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"SMACK!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get home.\" The girl's mother rebuked.\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nBecause no matter how he struggled,\n\nno matter how he roared in his heart,\n\nthe people outside could not perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine began to start.\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face.\n\nAnd because of this, he was incomparably terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nonly responsible for being upset,\n\nonly responsible for completing this procedure,\n\nthen going home to eat dinner, and continuing life tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being pushed into a narrow place filled with the smell of oily residue.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nsticky liquid sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what this was.\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nExtremely hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere............\n\n---\n[1] \"鬼壓床\" (guǐ yā chuáng): Literally \"ghost pressing on the bed,\" a common term in Chinese to describe sleep paralysis, where one feels awake but unable to move or speak.",

    "content": "cold,\n\n\n\nSo cold...\n\n\n\nZhou Ze didn't know why it was so cold here.\n\n\n\nHe walked on a secluded path. On both sides of the path, he was filled with flowers, without any romantic and beautiful atmosphere. The flowers were full of laughter, like ridicule, or like a spectator.\n\n\n\nFlowers open to the other shore, and people go to rebirth;\n\n\n\nZhou Cheng remembered that his last memory was fire, fire, and the terrifying flames completely swallowed himself, and the heart-pounding heat temperature baked himself into ashes\n\n\n\nBut in the eyes,\n\n\n\nHe came here\n\n\n\nThere are actually many people on this road.\n\n\n\nThere is an old man,\n\n\n\nHave children,\n\n\n\nThere are also young and middle-aged people.\n\n\n\nThere are men and women,\n\n\n\nEveryone wears different clothes\n\n\n\nSome people wear very simple clothes, some people wear big and purple clothes, with overly divided cheeks on their faces\n\n\n\nEveryone was walking on tiptoe,\n\n\n\nNo one said anything,\n\n\n\nNo one made any other sounds.\n\n\n\nOnly the occasional \"scrub\" sole friction sound left\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was also walking numbly with everyone. He was constantly looking back and looking back, and he realized where he had come.\n\n\n\nHe is already dead;\n\n\n\nAnd here,\n\n\n\nIt's a landlord\n\n\n\nHere is the world of the dead and the fate of the dead.\n\n\n\n  Own,\n\n\n\nFinally, I'm still dead\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what to do, nor did he know what choice he should make.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't want to die, and people don't want to die, but in this place, he has no idea what to do. He is confused and helpless\n\n\n\n\"Yaah……………………………………………………………………”\n\n\n\nThe cool little tunes are transmitted from afar.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze glanced over and saw the red flowers coming from afar, while others around him were all familiar with it. He continued to tiptoe his feet and walked forward.\n\n\n\nAfter getting closer, Zhou Ze saw clearly that the flowers were peach blossom papers. Along the way, there was a group of women, standing in a team, holding the papers, and walking gracefully\n\n\n\nThey are tall and have a stylish body. They are all wearing purple cheongsams and walking. The flesh color of their thighs is constantly exposed. The confusing charm makes people palpitations.\n\n\n\nWomen wear hair buns, meticulous, and even their steps are neat, as if they are the most outstanding singing and dancing groups in the world. Moreover, they have been practicing for more than a hundred years.\n\n\n\nThey are walking,\n\n\n\nThey are moving forward,\n\n\n\nFrom one end of the little one to the other,\n\n\n\nBy chance,\n\n\n\nPassed in front of Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nElaborate makeup, snow-white skin, and the cool and cold tuning that made me hummed create an old Shanghai atmosphere with a hazy rain.\n\n\n\nEvery woman wears a bracelet on her wrist, which is of different colors and sizes. The white and white wrists holding their snow-white wrists are even more dazzling.\n\n\n\n  pity,\n\n\n\nThey are not walking in the commercial pedestrian area of South Street.\n\n\n\nIt is not the golden and brilliant high-end clubhouse,\n\n\n\nThey stepped on the Huangquan Road,\n\n\n\nWhat is plundering is the sea of flowers on the other side.\n\n\n\nThey were blindly obedient, the latter stared at the former,\n\n\n\nThe former,\n\n\n\n  The eyes are empty\n\n\n\nWhen the last woman passed by Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nThe woman suddenly turned her head and looked at Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nThe world is the most beautiful.\n\n\n\n  now,\n\n\n\nJump directly to another extreme\n\n\n\n  fear\n\n\n\nOf course it's terrifying\n\n\n\n  Nausea\n\n\n\nOf course I feel disgusted\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze is already a dead person, and people will be scared to death, but what about ghosts\n\n\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at the woman.\n\n\n\nThe two have short eyes and a little intertwined. Then, the woman continued to walk forward, her figure was swaying, and her back was circling, and the tightness of the cheongsam outlined her beautiful figure very vividly.\n\n\n\n\"Where are you... going?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously followed the woman forward, and then left the original team.\n\n\n\nAnd the little boy murmured the walking people,\n\n\n\nThere was no one looking here, they seemed to be unable to think or perceive, and Zhou Ze seemed to be the difference among them.\n\n\n\nA group of women, smoking step by step, kept walking forward, murmuring, as if purity was like ice;\n\n\n\nThe originally suppressed environment makes people feel more reckless because of their appearance.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk forward, and he followed them\n\n\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw them walking into the pool in front one by one.\n\n\n\nThe pool is not big.\n\n\n\nLike a lens,\n\n\n\nTheir entry seemed to break this silence and blow a layer of ripples\n\n\n\nThe women in the front were no longer in the water, and the women behind were also following.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked to the pool. He did not go down with him, he just stood on the side and watched.\n\n\n\nEverything here is a place that is absolutely unfamiliar to him. Anyone, a single child, only has one chance to come in, and after entering, he can't go out again.\n\n\n\nSomething floated out in the middle of the pond water.\n\n\n\nIt's a double handed,\n\n\n\n  A red hands are white,\n\n\n\n  Detailed green pills,\n\n\n\nThe two hands danced gracefully, like a dream, making people's eyes instantly attracted to it and could no longer move.\n\n\n\nBeauty is attractive, and this kind of beauty is fascinating\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly showed an intoxicated look in his eyes, and he couldn't help but start moving forward without even knowing thatFirst, the foot,\n\n\n\nThe tightness followed by the knees,\n\n\n\nNext to the waist,\n\n\n\nIn the end,\n\n\n\nThe water surface is not in the neck.\n\n\n\nEven the whole person entered the pond\n\n\n\nThe water in the pond is not cold, it is even very warm, the water surface is clear, and it is very visible. When you enter here, you will feel no pain of suffocation.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw the women who were holding paper in the previous team. They were moving under the water, and they continued to move forward.\n\n\n\nAnd the closest location to you,\n\n\n\nThere is a woman in red clothes. She is standing under the water, but her hands are dancing on the water surface.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze began to approach this red woman.\n\n\n\nNot because of beauty,\n\n\n\nIt is not because of other false influences.\n\n\n\nBut because this woman seems to have an indecipherable magic that makes you approach, get close, and make you unable to help yourself.\n\n\n\n  finally,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze approached her.\n\n\n\nAnd her hands slowly closed off the water\n\n\n\nThe woman has long and dense hair, and she is dancing in the waves, making it difficult for people to see her face clearly\n\n\n\n\"Finally... wait for someone like this again...\"\n\n\n\nThe woman's voice is crisp, sweet and glutinous.\n\n\n\nCharming heart\n\n\n\nThe woman's beautiful hands stretched out and put them on Zhou Ze's shoulder. This action was very affectionate\n\n\n\n\"You... come and accompany me...\"\n\n\n\nNext moment,\n\n\n\nThe woman's hair began to scatter, and the long green silk began to blow around the face;\n\n\n\nThe beauty brushed her face, which seemed to be a very emotional thing, but then the woman's hair turned into the most imperfect steel cable in the world, and began to tie up her neck.\n\n\n\n\"You come and accompany me...\"\n\n\n\nThe hair is loose and no longer covered.\n\n\n\nThe woman's face finally appeared.\n\n\n\nShe has no face.\n\n\n\nHer face is flat, without any wavy, and without pleats. This is a very smooth face, enough to make thousands of girls jealous and admiration.\n\n\n\nBut she has no nose, no mouth, no eyes, and no ears.\n\n\n\nFaceless...female\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt that he could not breathe, and his chest was about to explode. At the same time, his body seemed to be about to collapse.\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman's smile is still crisp and empty, but at this time, Zhou Ze's ears are like magical sounds.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze has come to sober.\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what it meant to be scattered in this way in this place.\n\n\n\nBut in short,\n\n\n\nIt won't be a good ending\n\n\n\n\"You are here... accompanying me...\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl continued to smile and her hair danced\n\n\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously stretched out his hand to grab the hair that was lying on his neck. He wanted to try hard to remove it.\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl felt very interesting about his overestimating her abilities.\n\n\n\n\"If you can't kill, don't slap it. Those who can walk here are spirits, and those with spirits. If I swallow them, I will have the chance to go back.\n\n\n\nYou make a reservation,\n\n\n\nWill become,\n\n\n\nMy offerings”\n\n\n\nBut just as the voice just fell,\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman exclaimed: \"How is it possible... impossible...\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's ten-finger nails began to grow slowly, with a dark and transparent color. In this pool, the strange light belonging to it was flashing. The color of this nail was exactly the same as the nail color of the old man who Zhou Ze treated before his death.\n\n\n\n\"Sizzy......izzy......\"\n\n\n\nThe sound of the hot water oil kettle is transmitted,\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman's hair was furious and melted and collapsed when she touched Zhou Ze's nails, while Zhou Ze's figure began to slowly retreat and began to remove the faceless woman's thigh.\n\n\n\n\"Impossible...Impossible...This is impossible...Why can you leave too\n\n\n\nWhy can you leave me too?\n\n\n\n  Why\n\n\n\n  Why\n\n\n\nThis is unfair\n\n\n\nUnfair”\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman used her hands to hold Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nBut when Zhou Ze used his hands to remove the nails, once his nails touched the faceless hand, the faceless girl's originally perfect and flawless jade hand was burned out.\n\n\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman screamed,\n\n\n\nThe body began to retreat, and since then, he has lost control of Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's body began to float up.\n\n\n\n Absent from the surface\n\n\n\n\"You can't escape...you will be...you will be caught back\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n\n\nIt is the fate of the deceased\n\n\n\nYou, you and them, even if they leave, will eventually be caught back.\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman shouted and roared hysterically below.\n\n\n\nShe was jealous,\n\n\n\nShe admires it,\n\n\n\nShe was crazy\n\n\n\nAnd the rising circumstance,\n\n\n\nAnd I slowly lost my own consciousness,\n\n\n\nThe Netherworld Yellow Spring Road,\n\n\n\nThe dazzling beauty of the other side of the shore,\n\n\n\nThe roar of the faceless woman,\n\n\n\nThe cheongsam woman's polite appointment,\n\n\n\nEverything,\n\n\n\nIt seems that they are all moving away from him......",

    "content": "On the midnight streets,\n\nThe streetlights were yellow,\nThe people were uneasy,\nThe sky was very cold, and the wind, like knives, cut at people.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\nHe didn't know where this was again,\nBut he knew one thing:\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe had already died, but he had come back.\nHe didn't know what he should do,\nHe could only mechanically and numbly continue walking forward.\n\nHe didn't have the leisure to think about too many other things right now,\nSuch as the place he had just gone down to,\nSuch as the old man he had saved before the car accident,\nSuch as the faceless woman in the pond wearing a red dress,\nSuch as... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a very joyous thing, but even if someone occasionally walked past him, even if he waved harder, still no one could see him or hear him.\n\nHe was excluded by this world, isolated.\n\nPeople who haven't experienced \"solitary confinement\" wouldn't understand the pain of complete isolation, and for Zhou Ze, the entire world right now was his cage, with a layer of black cloth draped over it.\n\nNo one could see him,\nNor could anyone communicate with him,\nHe couldn't pick up anything tangible,\nEven,\nThe wind could easily blow right through him.\n\nHe was so frail,\nThe phrase \"weak enough to be blown away by a gust of wind\" applied to him, truly wasn't an exaggeration at all.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and terrified Zhou Ze the most was,\nHe could see faint points of light continuously dissipating from his body,\nIn other words,\nHis body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would completely disappear, erased without a trace, the last insignificant mark.\n\nHe didn't know how all of this happened, but he clearly knew that his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li entered the body of a person who had starved to death and collapsed, and only then became the image passed down in later generations.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return a soul,\" and he also wanted to do that. He was very cold and very panicked. He needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nIn fact, he didn't care who this person was.\n\nPeople are always selfish in such times, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he prepared to approach a person, points of light would appear above that person's head and on their shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close, and he even got hurt because of it, accelerating the speed of his \"evaporation.\"\n\nHe was a little tired, and a little numb.\nHe was waiting for his end,\nWaiting for his finish.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again would instead make him a little more composed.\n\nMoreover, given Zhou Ze's current situation, continuing to linger here meant that the longer he lingered, the longer he would endure torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\nAhead, there was a storefront still lit up. It seemed to be a bookstore, because through the glass door, rows of bookshelves could be seen inside.\nSomeone pushed the door open from inside and walked out. It was a man wearing a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his true face couldn't be clearly seen. He looked around for a while, then left in a hurry.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything abnormal, but not long after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\n\nYes,\nA warm aura.\n\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel a little bewildered, but right now he was like someone about to freeze to death who suddenly received a box of matches; even if he knew the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked over; his body passed directly through the bookstore's glass door, continued walking inside, and arrived behind the bookstore's bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\nA person was lying down.\nIt was a handsome young man, probably around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the store had air conditioning on, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\n\nHe was lying on the ground, but on his body, Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling, like a poor wretch walking on the road at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\n\nThis attraction was impossible to refuse, and right now, Zhou Ze also had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and squatted down in front of this young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to touch the warmth he needed.\n\nOne hand reached out and was placed on the other person's chest.\nZhou Ze saw that his fingernails actually slowly embedded themselves into the other person's body.\nThis was a very strange feeling, different from when the \"breeze\" blew through his body when he was walking on the road earlier; this was a blending, a fusion carried out using his fingernails as a medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other person's body; the two began to overlap.\n\n………………\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was woken up by a series of pushes—no, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his hands having been resting on it earlier.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, carrying an air of condescending authority.\n\nRaising his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him—no, to be precise, it should be a girl, probably high school age. Although she was a big girl, she still hadn't shed all her childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what exactly do you mean? You think you're capable now, huh? You want to make my parents and my sister lose face, huh? You actually dared not come home all night last night!\nWho gave you the guts to do that!\"\n\nXu Le?\nWho is that?\n\nZhou Ze somewhat blankly spread out his hands and found them very smooth. His hands used to have calluses from long hours of practicing with surgical instruments, but these hands didn't.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\nThe girl slammed a palm on the counter, full of aggressive momentum.\n\nZhou Ze slightly frowned, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror beside the shop door. He saw his reflection: it was an unfamiliar face—no, he had seen this face before, it was the face he saw last night.\n\nThis body,\nIs it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are really angry, and my mom even threw a tantrum at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now belongs to my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\nWho are you trying to put on a show for!\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe me, I'll come over and smack you directly!\"\n\nThe girl made a gesture to raise her palm, but she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, who was her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg for mercy as usual. Instead, the meaning in his eyes made her feel a little afraid.\n\nAt this time, she checked the time and found it was already seven-thirty.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school now. I'll settle scores with you tonight!\"\nThe girl walked away angrily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down on the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a mobile phone next to it.\n\nEven now, he still hadn't adapted to the process of his identity change.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\n\nAs a result,\nHe had now become this identity.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nI'm... a live-in son-in-law?\n\nHave a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nAnd looking at the attitude and tone his sister-in-law used when speaking in front of him, her \"brother-in-law,\" his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient \"fine traditions.\"\n\nA live-in son-in-law, colloquially known as \"entering the door in reverse\"<sup>[1]</sup>, was not only looked down upon by his wife's family, but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even similar to criminals, and during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced to serve on the frontier often included such live-in sons-in-law.\n\nPicking up the phone, he found it had no password set. He didn't know if that guy was lazy or didn't dare to set a password, but at least at this moment, it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThere were few people in the QQ list, just a few middle school, high school, and university classmates. Then there was a family list, with only one person in it, noted as \"Wife.\"\n\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her: empty.\n\nAlright,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried looking around. He found the woman noted as \"Wife.\" Here there were replies, mostly Xu Le asking about things, such as what to eat tonight, what to prepare tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how his health was—a whole bunch of questions.\n\nAnd the other party's replies were often very perfunctory and aloof,\nUsing:\n\"Oh\"\n\"Mm\"\n\"Okay\"\nTo replace longer answers.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This interpersonal relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails were no different from an ordinary person's.\n\nBut in matters like the old man he had saved before the car accident, his escape from the faceless woman, and his entry into this guy's body, his fingernails played an extremely crucial role.\n\nWith his will, his thoughts moved,\nRight at this moment,\nZhou Ze discovered his fingernails slowly began to lengthen, and at the same time became jet black and translucent, and even faint black mist swirled around his fingernails.\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nClosed his eyes,\nWhen he opened his eyes again,\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there trying to adapt to his new identity and also calming the sense of unease brought by his identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, not knowing if he forgot or if he simply didn't feel hungry.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District; the distance wasn't far.\n\nBy the afternoon, Zhou Ze finally sighed, silently stood up, and thought, \"Since I'm here, I might as well make myself at home.\"\n\nHe began trying to dust the bookshelves. Anyway, he might as well find something to do for himself first.\n\nThe old man who had choked him before he died had said, \"He's been discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said, \"You'll be caught sooner or later,\" which made Zhou Ze feel a slight sense of crisis.\n\nHis current state could be considered \"barely surviving.\" To die and then return to life was a blessing from heaven, so he cherished it greatly. At least, before fully understanding the situation and grasping enough clues, he had to immerse himself in this identity. It was best not to cause too much abnormality and not attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThis shop's business was truly bad. The sluggishness of the traditional book market wasn't a one or two-day affair, and this place wasn't on a prime \"golden street\" right by a school's main gate.\n\nIt could only be said that for that \"Xu Le\" to choose to open a bookstore here, whether he could even break even was a question.\n\nNot until three o'clock in the afternoon did the first customer of the day walk in.\n\nThe customer was lingering around the elementary school reading section, and lingered for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then still walked over and asked, \"What genre are you looking for?\"\n\n\"Just looking around,\" the other party replied.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze no longer paid attention; he still hadn't integrated into the role of \"bookstore owner\" yet.\n\nBut at this moment,\nThe other party suddenly walked behind him and spoke in a low, eerie voice:\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night I hit your head with a baseball bat and robbed your money,\nAnd I even specifically went and checked,\nYou clearly had no breath then.\"\n\n---\n<sup>[1]</sup> A colloquial and often derogatory term for a live-in son-in-law, implying he joins the wife's family rather than his own, and typically holds a lower social status.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned for a moment. So, the reason he was able to take over Xu Le's body last night for a 'borrowed corpse resurrection' was because Xu Le had just been killed?\n\nBecause the body was still warm, that's why he was able to enter?\n\nIt seems he was really quite lucky.\n\nThere was no aversion, no anger, nor any panic at his identity possibly being exposed. Zhou Ze turned around, looking at the man behind him, who was about the same age as himself.\n\nThe man was stunned for a moment.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy,\n\nit was relief,\n\nand even,\n\na hint of appreciation.\n\nAs a host, Zhou Ze clearly understood the difficult situation he faced last night. If this guy hadn't happened to kill someone at that moment, he might have already been scattered to the winds, unable to see the light of day.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night, and my head feels really uncomfortable this morning, like I'm drunk. I forgot what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the other party would guess that he was a ghost who had taken over a corpse, unless the other party's brain was full of water.*\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The other party pointed at his nose, a bit absurdly, \"Even though I told you I gave you a good whack yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine. I actually thank you for not taking my phone and computer from the table.\"\n\n\"Oh... I forgot about that,\" the man scratched his head. \"It's good that you're okay. This is the money I robbed from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man proactively took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then rummaged around again and pulled out another eight hundred yuan.\n\n\"Eight hundred yuan is for your medical expenses, and three hundred is what I robbed yesterday,\" the man pursed his lips. \"Yesterday, I gambled online and lost all my wages to the bookie. When I passed your bookstore, I suddenly wanted to get some money to spend. After I knocked you down, I realized you weren't breathing, and I was scared to death.\n\nAfter running home, I couldn't sleep all night, just thinking if the police would suddenly break down the door and arrest me. Home invasion, robbery, and murder, all for three hundred yuan... I felt so stupid, it wasn't worth it at all.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\n\"Buddy, it's really great that you're not dead, truly. I've been wandering outside since this morning. I was waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for the police to come. But then I saw you were actually still in the bookstore.\n\nYou know what? I almost knelt down and kowtowed to you then. Thank you. You're tough, you didn't die. Otherwise, I'd be finished. There are so many cameras here; if you had died, I definitely wouldn't have gotten away.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, then at the \"murderer\" in front of him, who was repenting with tears in his eyes. He just felt that the scene was very strange.\n\nTo be honest, Xu Le was dead. Because he was dead, Zhou Ze could take over his body. And because Zhou Ze took over his body, this guy in front of him was spared from a murder charge.\n\nBoth he and this guy in front of him benefited. Only Xu Le, that unlucky wretch, was the loser.\n\n\"Alright, it's fine. Maybe I just got a cramp last night.\" Zhou Ze moved the other party's hand off his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor; what kind of filth hadn't he seen? Yet, in that extreme environment, he had developed a slight cleanliness obsession. In fact, most emergency doctors have varying degrees of mysophobia.\n\nIt was precisely because he had witnessed too much filth and dirt that he knew how to cherish \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" the man asked, a little gleefully.\n\n\"No, I don't blame you,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Go work properly and live your life. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy. You're a straightforward person.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily, left the bookstore, and went to greet his \"new life.\"\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he still had to call the police. Not to report the other party for killing him (Xu Le), but to report them for suspected theft.\n\nAnyway, let the police investigate. If the other party really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and got caught by the police, it would serve him right.\n\nSince he had taken over someone else's body, he ought to do something for this unlucky wretch.\n\nAlthough, given the other party's good attitude in admitting his mistake and even giving him medical expenses, reporting him by name was indeed quite immoral, a bit like 'having a son without an anus'.**\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze had dialed 110 and the operator's voice came through,\n\nat the shop entrance,\n\nthat guy suddenly came back.\n\n\"There's something else...\" As soon as the other party walked in, he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He froze for a moment, then pointed directly at Zhou Ze, \"You son of a bitch, you're still going to call the police, aren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone, give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You broke your word, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly became agitated and excited. His mental state probably had a slight issue, perhaps due to a prolonged gambler's lifestyle and being disconnected from society. He often tended to become extreme when stimulated by certain things.\n\nThe other party lunged forward. Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to retreat.\n\nIn his previous life, he was a doctor, not a boxer, nor had he practiced martial arts. His body in this life was also a bit frail. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was indeed a bit flustered.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man slammed into Zhou Ze and pinned him against the wall, while his hands began to tightly squeeze Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I'll make you call the police, I'll make you call the police, I'll make you break your word! Fine, I'll make you die, make you truly die! This time, after I choke you to death, I'll drain your blood! Let's see if you're still not dead!\"\n\nThe man roared, gritting his teeth.\n\nThe poor bookstore business. In the afternoon, let alone customers, there weren't even many pedestrians outside the door.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. In the process of struggling, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and grew long.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his hands around the other party's back.\n\n\"Hiss.........\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, rolled his eyes, immediately let go of Zhou Ze's neck, stumbled back a few steps, knocked over several bookshelves, and then collapsed to the ground with a crash.\n\nZhou Ze was freed. He reached out and rubbed his neck. He hadn't been too panicked before, after all, his fingernails could even injure demons from hell. Dealing with a normal person shouldn't be a big problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze wasn't entirely clear about the specific reason for these fingernails or what their use was. He only knew that they were probably \"infected\" to him by the old man he saved before his car accident.\n\nIt really was,\n\n'got gray fingernails, one infects two'.^\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward, squatted down, and patted the man's face. Thankfully, he wasn't dead; he was still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n..............\n\nAfter finishing the statement at the police station, the police officer asked Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall. This was because the incident Zhou Ze reported was a bit odd: he said someone came to rob him, but the one who ended up being knocked out was actually the \"perpetrator.\" And now this perpetrator was still in the hospital; they had to wait for him to wake up to make further confirmations.\n\nHowever, the police officer at least didn't handcuff Zhou Ze.\n\nNext to Zhou Ze, a middle-aged man was squatting, his left hand locked to a radiator.\n\n\"Bro, you're awesome! That guy tried to rob you, but you took him down?\" The disheveled middle-aged man said, rubbing his long, grimy bangs. \"You've really got the same vibe I had when I was young! For these blind petty thieves, you gotta beat 'em to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you, behave yourself!\" a young police officer walked over and reprimanded. \"Is this your third time stealing electric bikes since winter began?\n\nI'm telling you, the New Year is almost here, can't you just settle down? Or find a proper job and earn some money to send home? Look how old you are already.\"\n\n\"Working a regular job is impossible, it's impossible in this lifetime to work a regular job. I don't know how to do business, so I can only steal electric bike batteries to maintain my lifestyle. Going into the detention center feels like going home.\n\nEveryone inside is a talent, and they speak so nicely; I super like it in there!\"#\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to bother with this guy anymore and simply turned and left.\n\n\"Bro, how was my little speech just now?\" The greasy middle-aged man winked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol, Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"I'm telling you, this life, you just gotta...\" The greasy middle-aged man paused, his gaze fixed on the doorway. \"Oh my goodness, she's so beautiful! Is that a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the doorway, a woman wearing a blue down jacket and long leather boots was walking towards them with another female police officer.\n\n\"Probably a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, it was her temperament that was the biggest plus.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a uniform,\" the greasy man countered.\n\n\"Maybe she's plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right, a beautiful police flower! Tsk, tsk, looks like I'll have to come in here more often in the future,\" the greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, looking unsatisfied. \"If I could marry her, I'd willingly lose ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He dared not joke carelessly about things like lifespan and vital essence anymore.\n\n\"You disagree?\" Seeing Zhou Ze shake his head, the greasy man hastily said, \"You call that having eyes but no pearls!** For a woman like that, losing ten years of your life to get one is definitely not a loss...\"\n\nAt this moment, the female police officer and the woman in long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to take you home. The investigation over there is clear; you're free to go,\" the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"............\" The greasy middle-aged man.\n\n---\n*   \"腦子進水了\" (nǎozi jìn shuǐ le): A Chinese idiom meaning \"brain-damaged,\" \"stupid,\" or \"crazy,\" literally \"brain filled with water.\"\n**  \"生兒子沒*****兒的意思\" (shēng ér zi méi pì yǎn er de yì si): A highly vulgar Chinese idiom expressing extreme contempt for someone's actions, implying that they are utterly despicable or inhumane.

    "content": "“Officer, excuse me, what was my wife’s name again?”\n\nThis thought merely crossed his mind; Zhou Ze wasn’t that foolish. But he truly didn’t know what his “wife’s” real name was. In this day and age, few people use their real names for QQ or WeChat.\n\nThe greasy man, however, cast a mournful glance at Zhou Ze: “Brother, you’re not playing fair. We said we’d be each other’s broken-winged angels, remember?”\n\nZhou Ze returned his glance with some helplessness: “I’m surprised too.”\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, “My dumplings are delicious.”\n\n“Let’s go.”\n\nThe “wife” said coldly, then turned and walked directly outside.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow along.\n\nShe drove a Cayenne and got straight into the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car door and got into the passenger seat.\n\nTo be honest, it was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unlucky fellow Xu Le’s marital and family life had been a little more normal, then he wouldn’t be in such an awkward position now. Facing his delicate wife’s concern, he could have found excuses to explain, like feeling dizzy and not remembering things clearly;\n\nBut this one clearly had the air of an ice goddess, seemingly completely uninterested in engaging with him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like a mere formality.\n\nMy dog got lost, the security guard found it, I’m going to pick it up. That’s the feeling.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as himself (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car got onto the elevated road, the woman finally spoke, breaking the silence:\n\n“Are you alright?”\n\n“Oh, I’m fine,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen, silence again.\n\nThe woman felt her husband was unusually quiet today, but she had no inclination to inquire why.\n\nJust then, the woman’s phone rang. She put it on speakerphone, and the voice from the other end came through the car’s audio system:\n\n“Doctor Lin, a school bus collision just occurred on Qingnian Middle Road. Casualties are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you back immediately.”\n\nZhou Ze was slightly taken aback.\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor.\n\nAnd, her surname was “Lin.”\n\n“I understand, I’ll be right back.” The woman hung up, exited the elevated road ahead, then made a sharp turn at the traffic light intersection and drove towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn’t ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back. Instead, she drove all the way into the parking lot of Chongchuan District People’s Hospital.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze was genuinely worried she’d make him get out and take a taxi home, imagining himself having to shamelessly ask, “Wife, where do we live again? I forgot.” It felt so silly.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got on the elevator, Zhou Ze followed her into the elevator. The woman entered the women’s changing room, and Zhou Ze…\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench by the corridor.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived: one critically injured, and five other children with serious injuries.\n\nWatching his “wife” change into her white coat and then emerge to busy herself with treatment, Zhou Ze could only sit on the bench, spacing out. It felt a bit like a mom bringing her son to work, with the mom working and the son watching nearby, amusing himself.\n\nHowever, the hospital’s distinctive smell of disinfectant and the stuffiness from the central air conditioning truly brought back memories, a familiar feeling.\n\nThe emergency room was ahead. The critically injured and life-threatening case seemed to be a girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus accident. Seeing the children crying out in pain on the operating tables, the scene was indeed quite heartbreaking.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Normally, at this time, he would have changed into his clothes and joined the treatment efforts. He was Tongcheng’s most renowned surgeon of the younger generation, but now, he could only be a spectator.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. Moreover, this People’s Hospital was openly considered Tongcheng’s best hospital, and the number and quality of its doctors were unquestionable; they should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was also brought in. Their injuries were minor, only requiring wound treatment or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were specifically guarding the entrance to this floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, their emotions very agitated. However, letting parents in at this time could potentially hinder the medical treatment, so they had to be stopped first.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the windowsill at the farthest end of the corridor, reached out to prop the window open high, then pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le smoked too, so it was convenient at this moment.\n\n“Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital.”\n\nJust as he bit the cigarette butt, a clear child’s voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, her mouth pouted, looking at him indignantly.\n\nAhem, that’s a bit awkward.\n\nZhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public morals was always a bit embarrassing.\n\n“Little one, aren’t you cold dressed so lightly?” Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a touch of baby fat on her face, large eyes, very cute, like an enlarged Barbie doll.\n\n“Not cold,” the little girl shook her head. “Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital anymore, okay?”\n\n“I know,” Zhou Ze nodded very seriously.\n\n“Are you alright?” Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n“I’m fine. The other children are all injured, and they’re in a lot of pain.”\n\nThe little girl turned sideways and looked at the children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying, not necessarily from unbearable pain, but rather because one person started crying and the others followed suit.\n\nThe nurses were both treating wounds and coaxing the children, while the parents temporarily held back by the traffic police outside kept shouting and cursing. In short, that floor felt chaotic.\n\n“Then you’re really lucky,” Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nThe little girl didn’t have a single scratch on her.\n\n“Uh-huh, I was sitting in the very back row, so I’m fine.” The little girl nodded, then actively ran over to comfort her classmates, checking on one, glancing at another, and encouraging and soothing them.\n\nA very sensible and resilient child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, subconsciously pulled out a cigarette again, then thought better of it and put it back.\n\nWhen he walked back and sat down on the bench, three nurses and two doctors emerged from the emergency room ahead.\n\nOne male doctor, one female doctor. The female doctor was his wife.\n\n“It’s alright, we did our best,” the male doctor said, reaching out to place a comforting hand on Zhou Ze’s wife’s shoulder.\n\nAs a husband, Zhou Ze was sitting right there, but he wasn’t repulsed by this scene…\n\nThat damn Xu Le had left him with such a complicated mess: a live-in son-in-law, a hot-tempered sister-in-law, and clearly ill-tempered in-laws.\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would hurry up and cheat on him, dump him, divorce him, and then he could just be by himself in peace.\n\nWho, after just dying and being reborn into a new body, would bother with the complexities of modern urban live-in son-in-law life, right?\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze’s surprise, his wife directly blocked the doctor’s wandering hand¹, pointing at him and saying:\n\n“This is my husband.” There was no tenderness in her words, simple, blunt, like she was saying: “This is my pet Husky.”\n\n“Oh, hello, sir,” the male doctor said, his face a little awkward. No matter what, hitting on someone’s wife right in front of them always felt a little lacking in confidence.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, acknowledging him. It seemed his wife was quite virtuous… but he couldn’t bring himself to be happy about it. It wasn’t some cuckold complex² acting up; it was simply, how much better life would be if it were simpler.\n\n“I’ll go check over there again. The other children have all been taken care of, there should be no more issues. You and your husband should go back and rest early.” The male doctor said this and then walked away.\n\nDoctor Lin then sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She removed her mask, took off her gloves, and threw them on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red-rimmed, her pearly teeth lightly biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a very bad mood, which meant the critically injured child couldn’t be saved.\n\nShe looked quite vulnerable.³\n\nZhou Ze somewhat understood Xu Le in his heart. This live-in son-in-law at least earned a lot more than his peers, the father-in-law’s family being better off was a prerequisite, and then, this Doctor Lin was indeed genuinely attractive.\n\n“Don’t take it to heart. You’ll experience much more in the future. Just seek peace of mind.”\n\nZhou Ze, as an experienced person, comforted her. His experience was much richer than that of his “wife,” and his psychological resilience was naturally much stronger.\n\n“Shut up,” the woman retorted with those two words. If Zhou Ze had said such a thing in his original capacity as a senior, it would indeed be guidance; but now that Zhou Ze was Xu Le, for him to say such a thing to Doctor Lin, it was purely talking from a position of ease⁴.\n\n“…………” Zhou Ze shrugged, once again despising Xu Le in his heart. “Look how cowardly you are, your wife dares to tell you to shut up directly in public.”\n\nDoctor Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up: “I’ll go change, then home.”\n\n“Okay,” Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nJust then, two nurses pulled open the emergency room curtain, revealing the bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered by a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze’s gaze swept over it. He had seen many dead people; throughout his years in medicine, he had saved many lives, but there were also many patients whom he was powerless to save and could only watch die right before him.\n\n“Doctor Lin, this is your husband, isn’t he?” a young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Doctor Lin was married, but her husband was different from the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses; he had never shown his face at the hospital.\n\nYou can’t blame them for cracking a joke even when facing death. It’s like asking those who go to Tibet once and post on social media about their purified, touched, and devout souls to stay there for ten years; they couldn’t endure it. It’s unrealistic.\n\n“Yes,” Doctor Lin nodded in response. By this point, her emotions had calmed somewhat.\n\n“Then you two should hurry back. Who knows what activities await you back home, right? I’m telling you, our Doctor Lin just loves children! You two should rush home and get to it…”\n\n“Fuck!”\n\n“…………” The young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze saw the hem of a lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind went blank with a “boom,” and he suddenly realized that the unharmed little girl he had just seen… she wasn’t human!\n\n---\n¹ *Wandering hand*: A colloquial term for a lecherous or groping hand.\n² *Cuckold complex*: Refers to the feeling of being cuckolded, as wearing a “green hat” (戴綠帽) in Chinese culture symbolizes being cheated on.\n³ *She looked quite vulnerable*: An idiom describing someone so beautiful or vulnerable that even the observer cannot help but feel pity or sympathy for them.\n⁴ *Talking from a position of ease*: An idiom meaning to give advice or comment on a difficult situation without truly understanding the pain or difficulty involved; to speak from a position of ease or privilege.",

    "content": "\"Fuck!\"\nAfter that,\nThe two young nurses were a little at a loss, and Doctor Lin was also stunned for a moment.\nIt was simply too blunt and crude a response.\n\nZhou Ze offered no explanation, simply reaching out and pulling back the white cloth covering the girl's head.\nIt was her, it was indeed her!\nNo wonder she had no injuries at all just now,\nNot even a scratch on her body.\nThis wasn't luck she got from sitting in the back row.\nIn reality,\nShe was the most heavily injured among all the children; the doctor had just been fully resuscitating her.\nHer soul had already drifted out, yet she was still unaware. She was still reminding herself not to smoke in public and had gone to comfort those classmates and children who had suffered minor injuries.\nIn fact,\nThose children couldn't see her at all.\nIn the entire hospital,\nThe only one who could see her,\nWas Zhou Ze!\n\n\"Is she dead?\" Zhou Ze asked, his gaze scanning around.\n\n\"Xu Le?\" Doctor Lin looked at her husband. She didn't want to pay attention to his cursing just now, because she realized her husband's mental state was a bit abnormal.\n\n\"She's not dead yet, keep saving her, keep resuscitating!\"\nZhou Ze suddenly grabbed Doctor Lin's arm, pulled her over, and roared:\n\"The resuscitation time limit hasn't passed yet, there's still a chance for her to wake up, keep resuscitating!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir!\"\nSeeing Zhou Ze grabbing Doctor Lin so roughly, the two nurses immediately stepped forward, ready to pull Zhou Ze away. In their eyes, Doctor Lin's husband was a bit baffling, and he even showed a tendency towards domestic violence.\n\nZhou Ze pushed away the two nurses beside him, also letting go, and muttered softly:\n\"Where are you, where are you, where on earth are you!\"\nZhou Ze rushed out. He was running, searching.\nJust moments ago, the girl's soul was still wandering among the children, comforting them, but now her whereabouts were unknown.\nHad she already gone to hell?\nShe was already dead.\nWas it already too late?\nZhou Ze was a bit confused; he didn't know why he was so agitated, nor why he was so anxious.\nPerhaps it was because of his profession; it was his duty to treat any patient who might survive. Moreover, that kind and strong girl had just had an interaction with him.\n\n\"Uncle, are you looking for me?\"\nA familiar child's voice sounded behind Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze immediately turned around and saw the little girl again.\nOnly, the little girl's body was not as solid as before; she had now become semi-transparent.\n\"Uncle, I'm a bit cold.\" The little girl hugged her arms and squatted down. \"I tried to find the nurses to ask them to lend me some clothes, but the nurses didn't pay attention to me. Do they hate me? Am I very annoying?\"\nSpecks of light continuously emanated from the little girl's body. Zhou Ze had seen this scene before; it had happened to him back then.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\nDoctor Lin walked over at this moment.\nThe little girl turned her head, looking behind her.\n\"Don't look!\"\nZhou Ze stepped forward, reaching out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen if she saw her own corpse lying on the bed.\nWould she collapse?\nWould she realize she was dead and then directly dissipate?\nWhen Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, Zhou Ze's fingernails warmed up slightly at this moment. They didn't lengthen, nor did they turn black, but Zhou Ze felt them very hot. At the same time, the little girl's body began to twist, transforming into a circle of light that coiled around Zhou Ze's fingertips. Others around them clearly couldn't see these lights.\n\n\"Get out of the way, she can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze rushed towards the hospital bed again.\n\n\"Xu Le!\" Doctor Lin's chest heaved. The deceased was gone, and she didn't know what kind of madness her husband was still rambling on about. Moreover, her husband had studied civil engineering and had absolutely no relation to medicine.\n\nThis time, when Zhou Ze rushed over, the two young nurses didn't dare to stop him. Zhou Ze pulled back the white cloth and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\nYes, this was how he had come back to life back then.\nYour soul came out,\nIt can still go back in,\nYou can live!\nAfter seeing all the light from his fingertips disappear into the girl's body, Zhou Ze began to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pressing on the girl with his hands clasped together.\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\"Wake up!\"\nThe two nurses didn't dare to go up close and both looked at Doctor Lin.\n\n\"She's dead.\"\nDoctor Lin walked to Zhou Ze's side and said.\n\n\"The golden time for resuscitation hasn't passed yet, I've been keeping track of the time,\" Zhou Ze roared, continuing to press. \"She can live, she can live!\"\n\nDoctor Lin pursued her lips, directly reached out and pushed Zhou Ze away, and then began pressing on the girl's chest herself with her hands clasped.\n\"Your force is too great, she has injuries on her body. A Chun, reconnect the instruments, continue resuscitation.\"\n\nZhou Ze was pushed away but wasn't angry; he just kept staring at the little girl on the hospital bed.\nThe only thing to be thankful for was probably that the parents were stopped by the traffic police, and with so many children still making noise outside, no one noticed what was happening here.\n\nDoctor Lin continued pressing, and beads of sweat had already appeared on her forehead. She didn't know why she was indulging in this madness with this man, but for some reason, she had just seen a hint of something unusual in his eyes.\nAnd this man was her husband. Today, however, she found him a bit unreadable.\nThe instruments were reconnected, but the display screen still showed a flat line.\nThe two young nurses stood by, a little at a loss.\nCouldn't she be saved?\nEven if he put the soul back,\nCould she still not be saved?\nA sense of loss and melancholy spread through Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n\"Beep... beep... beep...\"\nJust then,\nThe previously flat line suddenly wavered.\nDoctor Lin looked at the display screen with a look of shock.\nThis,\nWas this a medical miracle?\n\n...................\n\nIt was already evening when they drove out of the hospital and went home. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat, Doctor Lin was driving, and neither of them spoke.\nSilence, it seemed, was a standard feature of the couple's relationship. However, in the past, it was always Xu Le who tried to break the silence, while today, it was Doctor Lin.\n\n\"Did you study medicine?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Your technique just now was very professional.\" Doctor Lin could tell.\n\"I had training when I got my driver's license.\" Zhou Ze casually made up an excuse.\n\"But you don't have a driver's license.\" Doctor Lin frowned slightly.\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\nHmm, Zhou Ze silently despised Xu Le again in his heart.\n\nDoctor Lin didn't intend to probe further, merely saying, \"Today, thank you for your persistence.\"\n\"No need to thank me.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least in his heart he still considered himself a doctor, saving a patient really didn't require thanks.\nThe girl hadn't woken up yet and was still in a coma, but at least there was hope.\n\n\"I thank you on behalf of that girl.\" Doctor Lin picked up her phone and checked the time. \"It's almost eight o'clock, my parents are still waiting for us to come home for dinner.\"\nParents?\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a headache coming on.\nWas he already going to meet his mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nThe car drove into a high-end residential area. Tongcheng is close to Shanghai, located at opposite ends of the Yangtze River estuary from it. Although land here wasn't as prohibitively expensive as in Shanghai, housing prices were still not very cheap.\nDoctor Lin parked the car and walked inside. Zhou Ze followed behind her. The two entered the elevator, then exited together, and Doctor Lin opened a door with a key.\nThe house was nicely decorated, with a duplex layout. In fact, it could be seen from the car Doctor Lin drove that the Lin family's financial situation must be quite good.\nOf course, his current identity as a \"live-in son-in-law\" was also evidence; after all, without some money and financial backing, a family wouldn't be able to attract a live-in one.\n\nOn the living room sofa, an old man with half-white hair, dressed in a sweater, sat watching TV. It was a rerun of the News Broadcast, and he was watching with great interest.\nEven when his own daughter and son-in-law returned, he just glanced at them and said nothing.\n\n\"Wanqiu, you're back.\"\nThe kitchen door was pushed open, and the mother-in-law poked her head out. Perhaps Doctor Lin and her younger sister's height were both inherited from their mother; the mother-in-law was very tall, a little plump now, but still the type who could dominate the scene at the \"Sunset Red\" square, attracting countless old men and grandpas to vie for her attention. [1]\n\nPay attention, take notes, highlight this:\nZhou Ze finally knew his wife's full name — Lin Wanqiu.\nThe mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze and noticeably sank.\n\n\"Old man, dinner's ready, Wanqiu is back.\"\n\"Finally, time to eat.\" The younger sister-in-law walked out of the study. She waved her fist at Zhou Ze, then pursed her lips, signaling Zhou Ze to pay attention to her parents.\nThis small gesture was quite good. Although this girl was a bit overbearing, she wasn't too excessive.\n\nZhou Ze went to the bathroom to wash his hands. While he was washing, Lin Wanqiu also came in. Both of them were rubbing their hands together with hand soap, and both rubbed them very carefully.\nLin Wanqiu took a couple more glances at Zhou Ze, then rinsed her hands with water and walked into the living room.\nZhou Ze also rinsed his hands, wiped them with a paper towel, and walked out of the bathroom.\nEveryone was seated, and Zhou Ze sat down in the chair beside Lin Wanqiu.\nThe mother-in-law, with a stern face, served the rice bowls one by one. When she placed one in front of Zhou Ze, she clearly used a little more force.\nGood thing,\nShe didn't deliberately skip serving me rice.\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n\"Xu Le, do you think we treat you badly?\" the mother-in-law asked as soon as she sat down, before even eating.\n\"Quite good.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\"Then why didn't you come home last night? Who were you giving the cold shoulder to—\"\n\"Mom, let's eat. Something came up at his shop, he told me about it,\" Lin Wanqiu interjected.\nThe mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged glances, a bit surprised that their eldest daughter would actually speak up for this son-in-law. This made them a bit unaccustomed, and for a moment, they forgot to continue their tirade.\nThe younger sister-in-law, watching from the side, was also a bit surprised. Her elder sister had never really cared much about this so-called brother-in-law. Had the sun risen from the west today? [2]\n\n\"Let's eat.\" The father-in-law picked up his chopsticks and gestured. \"You eat too.\" The father-in-law specifically pointed his chopsticks at Zhou Ze.\nHmm, this action was a bit impolite, but it was fine, signaling that what happened last night was past them.\n\n\"Wanqiu, have a piece of braised pork, Mom stewed it for a long time.\"\nThe mother-in-law put a piece of meat in the bowls of both her elder and younger daughters, then hesitated for a moment before putting a piece in her son-in-law's bowl too.\nOnly then did Zhou Ze realize he hadn't eaten anything all day. From last night, when he borrowed a corpse to return his soul, until morning and noon, he hadn't eaten.\nHe didn't stand on ceremony.\nHe picked up the meat, put it in his mouth.\nImmediately after,\nZhou Ze's face stiffened.\nA surge of unexpected nausea rose from his heart, and his stomach began to cramp wildly.\n\"Ugh...\" Zhou Ze dry-heaved, as if what he was eating was poison.\n\"...\" The mother-in-law.\n\"...\" The father-in-law.\nThe atmosphere at the dinner table,\nInstantly froze over.\n\n---\n[1] \"Sunset Red\" (夕陽紅): Refers to groups or activities for the elderly, often involving dancing or exercises in public squares.\n[2] \"Had the sun risen from the west today?\" (今天太陽打西邊出來了): A Chinese idiom used to express surprise at something highly unusual or unexpected happening.",

    "content": "「My apologies.」\n\nZhou Ze gestured with his hand, indicating it wasn't intentional, as it was truly humiliating, especially given that he didn't know why \"Xu Le,\" this live-in son-in-law, was so disliked by his father-in-law and mother-in-law.\n\n「Are you feeling unwell?」Dr. Lin put down her chopsticks and asked.\n\n「It's nothing, nothing.」\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled rice into his mouth,\n\nBut just as he had it in his mouth and hadn't yet swallowed,\n\nHis stomach spasmed again, and a strong sense of nausea rose from deep within him, as if what he was about to swallow wasn't rice, but the rice's son—shit*.\n\n「Pfft...」\n\nThis time,\n\nZhou Ze sprayed all the rice grains from his mouth,\n\nSpraying them onto the faces of his father-in-law and mother-in-law sitting opposite him.\n\nRice grains stuck to his father-in-law's glasses frame and hair,\n\nHis mother-in-law's coiled hair was also sparkling white,\n\nWith a \"plop,\"\n\nThe chopsticks in his father-in-law's hand fell, his face twitched a few times, as if he hadn't yet processed what emotion to use to face the current situation.\n\nHis mother-in-law, however, took a deep breath, and the rage in her eyes was already blazing!\n\nThis was,\n\nThrowing away goodwill!\n\n「Bang!」\n\nHis mother-in-law pushed away the chair behind her and stood up.\n\n「Xu Le!」\n\nHis mother-in-law was a retired head nurse, so she knew that even if someone was sick, they couldn't spray food so exaggeratedly. Moreover, looking at Xu Le, he didn't seem to be \"critically ill and not long for this world.\"\n\nHe was doing this on purpose,\n\nHe must be doing this on purpose!\n\nHe was rebelling!\n\nRebelling!\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest, left the dining table directly, rushed into the bathroom, lifted the toilet lid, and started to retch violently.\n\nThis time, he even threw up bile, and his mouth tasted bitter.\n\nThis meal was impossible to eat.\n\nDr. Lin looked at Xu Le, who was still vomiting in the bathroom, and said directly to her younger sister:\n\n「Xiao Yi, go cook some noodles.」\n\n「Oh, okay.」\n\nThe sister-in-law stuck out her tongue; she also felt that her brother-in-law was going a bit too far today. She immediately left the table and went to the kitchen to prepare some dried noodles.\n\n「Outrageous! That scoundrel!」\n\nHis father-in-law slapped the table, reached out, took off his glasses, and shook them. Xu Le's father-in-law was a retired vice president, and usually paid the most attention to refined manners and appearance. Today, it had really crossed his bottom line.\n\n「I'll go find that fellow and ask him what on earth my family has done to wrong him! We didn't ask him for a single cent of *caili*^ for the wedding, and we even paid for him to open that money-losing bookstore. How have we wronged him?!」\n\nHis mother-in-law prepared to go to the bathroom.\n\n「Mom, clean this up. He's not feeling well.」\n\nDr. Lin began clearing the plates on the table, which had barely been touched.\n\n「Even like this, you're still defending him?」His mother-in-law, bursting with anger, pointed directly at her daughter and scolded her.\n\n「Otherwise what? Who was it who threatened to hang themselves to force me to marry him back then?」Dr. Lin looked directly at her mother, her beautiful face appearing especially resolute at this moment.\n\nHis mother-in-law was momentarily speechless. Indeed, it was they who had forced their daughter to marry back then. They desperately wanted a grandson, so they went to great lengths to recruit Xu Le as a live-in son-in-law. Their thinking at the time was simple: she and her husband only had two daughters, so there was no choice but to recruit a live-in son-in-law so that the grandson would carry their family name. And Xu Le's parents were no longer alive, and he was a university graduate, so he met the criteria.\n\n「I'm not eating.」\n\nHis father-in-law dared not meet his daughter's gaze. It was he who had personally made the final decision back then. Thinking about it now, he indeed felt he had wronged his daughter somewhat. He stood up directly and returned to his study.\n\n「Oh, old man, you have a stomach problem!」His mother-in-law called out anxiously.\n\n「Mom, take a bowl of noodles to Dad later.」\n\nDr. Lin finished clearing the table and then walked towards the bathroom.\n\nHis mother-in-law watched her daughter's back and finally said nothing more.\n\nPushing open the glass door of the bathroom, Dr. Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling beside the toilet, one hand gripping the edge of the toilet and the other clutching his chest.\n\n「Are you uncomfortable?」\n\n「I'm alright.」Zhou Ze replied. He had been perfectly fine before dinner; who knew he would become like this just as he was about to eat?\n\n「I asked Xiao Yi to prepare some noodles. You can eat later...」\n\n「Ugh...」\n\nAt the thought of noodles, Zhou Ze felt a strong sense of nausea surge up from deep within him again, and he started dry heaving once more.\n\nLin Wanqiu frowned slightly,\n\n「Should we go to the hospital?」\n\n「No need, it's nothing. I won't eat anymore.」\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, stood up with great difficulty, and went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face with water.\n\nTonight's dinner was destined to end unhappily.\n\nHis father-in-law, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu's bedroom was on the second floor.\n\nAfter cleaning himself up, Zhou Ze also took a shower. Since he didn't know where his change of clothes was, he simply didn't change for now, still wearing his previous clothes with wet hair as he went up to the second floor. As he emerged from the stairwell, he found Lin Wanqiu showering in the second-floor bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the bathroom door for a while, looking at her graceful figure reflected within, and gently licked his lips.\n\nPeople are always most impulsive at such times, and of course, also most appreciative.\n\n「Thank you.」\n\nZhou Ze murmured inwardly.\n\nThis was the first time in two days since \"borrowing a corpse to revive a soul\" that Zhou Ze gave a thumbs-up to that unlucky guy Xu Le.\n\nAlthough you left behind an extremely terrible social network, your wife is truly beautiful.\n\nCarrying a bit of fantasy, a bit of excitement, a bit of impatience, a bit of anticipation,\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door,\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze's expression changed, and he bit his lip.\n\nIn his mind, he dragged out Xu Le, whom he had just praised, and frantically \"whipped his corpse\" ten thousand times.\n\nThe bedroom was large,\n\nA large bed,\n\nBeside the large bed,\n\nThere was also a floor mat!\n\nWhat on earth did this mean? Even an idiot would know!\n\nWas that guy insane?\n\nWas that guy an idiot?\n\nWhat's the point of being a live-in son-in-law like this?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths in a row, then silently lay down on the floor mat.\n\nSleep,\n\nNo more fussing.\n\nNo more thinking.\n\nSee if he could get some money, move out independently, and then, whether it was divorce or whatever, resolve this complicated relationship. He had many problems to face since borrowing a corpse to revive a soul and sneaking back.\n\nLin Wanqiu finished her shower and came out. She was wearing a blue nightgown, which was a bit loose and looked somewhat baggy on her.\n\nZhou Ze, lying on the floor mat, unconsciously swallowed.\n\n「Get up,」Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n「Huh?」\n\n「You've always slept on the bed, and I've slept on the floor mat,」Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n「...」Zhou Ze silently got up and got into bed.\n\nLin Wanqiu turned off the light and lay down on the floor mat.\n\nPerhaps this was her compensation for not wanting to share a bed with Xu Le: she slept on the floor mat.\n\nZhou Ze sighed,\n\nAnd prepared to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, he wasn't asleep, so he turned over.\n\nAn hour later, still not asleep, he turned over again.\n\nIt wasn't until three hours later, already past midnight, that he still couldn't fall asleep.\n\nHis eyelids were fighting, but he just couldn't sleep.\n\nLin Wanqiu on the floor mat, however, had steady breathing; she was probably asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it definitely wasn't because there was a beautiful woman sleeping next to him that he was restless and couldn't sleep;\n\nHe was very sleepy and very tired, after all, so much had happened today.\n\nBut damn it, he just couldn't sleep.\n\nLying on the bed, Zhou Ze simply opened his eyes and looked at his hands.\n\nToday, he had used these hands to save that little girl's life. Although the little girl hadn't woken up yet, her vital signs had returned, so she could still be saved.\n\nWas this a special ability he gained after a trip to hell?\n\nOr,\n\nSomething left behind by that old man when he grabbed his wrist before he died?\n\nHowever,\n\nIt seemed to feel pretty good.\n\nAs a doctor, with these hands, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that transcended the scope of medical technology and understanding, capable of even allowing him to reach a level surpassing Hua Tuo and Bian Que. Practitioners in every industry hoped to one day surpass their grandmasters; perhaps this wasn't for money or gain, but a kind of... sentiment.\n\nBut it was precisely at this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt his arms convulse, and intense pain quickly assailed him.\n\n「Hiss...」\n\nZhou Ze gasped sharply, his entire body curling up on the bed.\n\nBut this pain continued, and it was escalating!\n\nZhou Ze was in so much pain that cold sweat streamed out. Unable to bear it any longer, he could only get out of bed and leave the bedroom.\n\nHe came to the bathroom, didn't turn on the light, and just sat on the toilet. At this moment, Zhou Ze saw streaks of bulging blue veins on his arms, almost to the point of splitting open, extending all the way to his fingernails.\n\nThe pain originated from them, as if something was pounding on his bone marrow.\n\nDamn it,\n\nWhat on earth was going on?!\n\nZhou Ze's face began to contort.\n\nThis feeling made him wish he were dead, even making him feel an impulse to take a cleaver and chop off his own arms.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to recall the scene of himself lying in an ice coffin, about to be pushed into the incinerator.\n\nAnd also recalled fragments of stumbling forward in hell, heading towards the end.\n\nWas this a curse?\n\nWas this punishment?\n\nWhy was I being punished?\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I sneaked back?\n\nBecause I'm not a living person, so Heaven is punishing me?\n\nOr perhaps... because I used it to save someone today?\n\nThat's right, it must be that reason.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he had used that ability to save someone, he had broken some rule and was suffering a backlash?\n\nThen,\n\nIf he went and killed that girl again now, would the pain stop?\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eye sockets, a hint of black mist began to gather, but he was completely unaware.\n\n「Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital, you know.」\n\nThe little girl's voice reappeared in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head violently.\n\nNo!\n\nI saved her, and that's that!\n\nI don't regret it,\n\nNo regrets!\n\n...\n\n「Mom, are you still not done?」\n\n「I just started. You can go to the second-floor bathroom.」\n\n「Alright.」\n\nThe sister-in-law went up to the second floor. She really couldn't hold it anymore. The second-floor bathroom light wasn't on, so she pushed open the door and walked straight in.\n\nThen,\n\nAt that very moment,\n\nZhou Ze looked up at her,\n\nAnd she also looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, black mist swirled, carrying an incredibly strong deterrent force. It was a gaze like that of a malevolent ghost crawling out of hell, cursed and deranged.\n\n「Ahhhhhh!!!!!!」\n\nThe sister-in-law screamed in terror,\n\nThen her entire body fell to the ground.\n\nShe looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was also looking at her.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze saw that the sister-in-law's nightgown—was wet, and an incongruous liquid appeared on the tiles...\n\nShe was, by him,\n\nScared so much she peed herself?\n___\n^: \"Rice's son\" (米田共 - mǐ tián gòng) is a humorous, visual way to write the Chinese character for \"feces\" (屎 - shǐ), by breaking it into its component parts (米 'rice', 田 'field', 共 'together').\n^: *Caili* (彩礼 - cǎilǐ) refers to a traditional betrothal gift or bride price given by the groom's family to the bride's family in Chinese culture.",

    "content": "A scream woke up the family;\n\nAnd no wonder,\n\na bathroom with the lights off late at night, holding back the urge to pee, opening the door and suddenly seeing someone inside – that was already scary enough, and most people have probably had similar experiences.\n\nWhat's more, what the sister-in-law encountered was a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and reached out to pull her sister up.\n\n\"What's wrong, what's wrong!\"\n\nThe father-in-law and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor, saw their younger daughter crying in her sister's arms, and then glanced at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"You scoundrel Xu Le, you good-for-nothing whose heart is clouded by lard, you dare to lay hands on my youngest daughter!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law picked up the broom by the bathroom door, ready to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was the same, fuming and ready to come in and teach this scoundrel son-in-law a lesson.\n\nAnd no wonder,\n\nseeing this scene,\n\neveryone would naturally jump to that conclusion.\n\nThe brother-in-law went crazy,\n\nacting improperly towards his sister-in-law,\n\nafter all, as the saying goes, a sister-in-law has half a *certain something* that belongs to her brother-in-law. [1]\n\n\"Mom, Dad, Xiao Yi was scared when she went into the bathroom,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law froze for a moment, the broom in her hand raised, unsure where to put it.\n\nThe father-in-law also paused, then awkwardly stepped back a few paces.\n\nDistracted by this, Zhou Ze suddenly realized that the bulging veins on his arms had receded at some point, and the intense pain had also disappeared.\n\nHe felt so tired, so sleepy, and really wanted to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, ready to leave the bathroom. As for his father-in-law and mother-in-law, Zhou Ze was too lazy to argue with them; he had no interest in cleaning up the mess left by that coward Xu Le.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze stood up, the sister-in-law immediately shivered several times in fright, clinging tightly to her sister.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come closer! Don't come closer!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. What had she just seen?\n\n\"What on earth happened?!\" the mother-in-law asked her youngest daughter, hands on hips. This didn't look like mere fright. \"Xiao Yi, my heart's darling, tell Mom, what exactly happened? Did he *do something* to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was still very honest, and she knew that she couldn't lie about this, otherwise the matter would become very serious.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, opened the door, and saw him sitting there. It was too scary!\"\n\nAfter saying this with courage, the sister-in-law buried her head in her sister's arms again.\n\nAlright,\n\nit was just a misunderstanding after all.\n\n\"You brainless thing, going to the toilet late at night and not turning on the light?\n\nDo you think my house is your house? So stingy,\n\ngrudging this little bit of electricity!\n\nIf you scare my daughter into something serious, what will you use to compensate...?\"\n\nThe mother-in-law began to scold Zhou Ze, her finger almost poking his face.\n\nZhou Ze was very tired at this moment. When a person is extremely sleep-deprived, their temper tends to be very irritable. Furthermore, Zhou Ze had long been impatient with the infuriating network of relationships Xu Le had left him.\n\nIf they hadn't been sleeping in separate beds,\n\nZhou Ze might not have erupted yet,\n\nbut now that even the beds were separated,\n\nZhou Ze was too lazy to endure this snobbish mother-in-law's temper any longer.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, directly swatting away the mother-in-law's finger that was pointing at him.\n\n\"Don't bother me.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened, clearly unable to believe that this son-in-law, who was always so cowardly, dared to speak to her like this.\n\n\"How are you talking to your mother? Do you have no manners?!\" At this moment, the father-in-law reprimanded him.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to become a divorcee, then keep talking to me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze directly retorted, then shoved his father-in-law aside with his shoulder and walked back to the bedroom.\n\nWith a \"Bang!\", he slammed the door shut very forcefully.\n\n\"How preposterous, how preposterous!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law quickly went to her husband's side to soothe his chest.\n\nBut in the end, neither of them dared to continue making a fuss.\n\nAfter all,\n\nwhat Zhou Ze had just said was very intimidating to them.\n\nAlthough they didn't know what was wrong with their cowardly son-in-law, who usually couldn't fart even if you beat him with eight sticks [2], he was right: if their eldest daughter divorced, her next marriage would be a second marriage, which would be bad for her reputation and for their family's reputation.\n\nMoreover, in their view, a woman's value decreased after a second marriage, and she wouldn't find a good family.\n\nIn truth, a person's character and whether their thinking is feudal are not significantly influenced by their education or family background; it fundamentally depends on the individual's inherent qualities.\n\nJust like Xu Le's father-in-law and mother-in-law at this moment, no matter how angry they were, they didn't dare to provoke their scoundrel son-in-law any further at this time, for fear that he might actually jump up and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and intended to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour,\n\nZhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door:\n\n\"Xiao Yi is scared, I'll go sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice, and then she left.\n\nSaid as if you actually slept with me;\n\n.........\n\nThe next day at noon,\n\nthe father-in-law and mother-in-law were eating lunch.\n\n\"He went to the bookstore?\" the father-in-law asked the mother-in-law.\n\n\"He hasn't gotten up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Unacceptable,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"Exactly...\"\n\nAt this moment, the mother-in-law suddenly fell silent, because she saw Zhou Ze coming down from upstairs. Zhou Ze's eyes were red-rimmed, and he had severe eye bags.\n\nThe atmosphere was somewhat stagnant,\n\nPerhaps because of last night's events, Zhou Ze's status as the live-in son-in-law in this family had risen somewhat. At the very least, at this moment, his father-in-law and mother-in-law didn't say anything more to provoke him.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze's current appearance looked exactly like someone who might grab a knife and start chopping at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept over the dinner table,\n\nZhou Ze reached out and covered his chest,\n\nThe smell of rice,\n\nthe smell of meat,\n\nso disgusting,\n\nhe wanted to vomit again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the house, breathing in the slightly cool, fresh air outside, and felt a little better.\n\nHis head felt a bit fuzzy, and Zhou Ze began to wander and walk alone on the street. He needed to quietly think about some things, but his current state of extreme sleepiness yet inability to sleep made it difficult for him to truly calm down.\n\nIt was very vexing,\n\nvery uncomfortable,\n\nlike walking out of an internet cafe after pulling all-nighters for two days straight, or like a middle school student who had stayed up all night hiding under the covers reading novels and then had to get up early for class the next day.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. The surroundings felt somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign ahead,\n\nTongcheng First Affiliated Hospital.\n\nHe actually walked to his old workplace, ha, perhaps it was just because Tongcheng was too small.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the hospital, not for a nostalgic visit, but intending to get some sleeping pills to try;\n\nNot eating, he could still manage for a bit; at most, he could drink more water, and a water-filled stomach could temporarily suffice. But not sleeping was long-term torture.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar work environment. Zhou Ze saw his own photo had turned grayscale on the staff album for the emergency department on the ground floor of the building.\n\nThen he subconsciously walked to his original office. His desk had a new occupant; a middle-aged doctor with many pockmarks on his face was sitting in his spot. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk; the surname was Kang.\n\nHe let out a long breath, feeling a slight sense of melancholy.\n\nZhou Ze temporarily forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps this feeling of \"things are no longer what they once were\" (物是人非) temporarily suppressed the torment of sleepiness, and Zhou Ze began to wander around the hospital.\n\nHe was reliving every little detail of his life here,\n\nhis work,\n\nhis life,\n\nand,\n\nhis past,\n\nor rather, his previous life.\n\nHe couldn't go back, he really couldn't go back, Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nThen, unknowingly, he found himself walking down the stairs, arriving at the basement level.\n\nHe stood still. As a doctor who had worked there for many years, he knew the layout of this floor.\n\nSome equipment storage rooms, and then, the morgue.\n\nHe remembered having once lain in the hospital morgue, where he had been made up by a mortician.\n\nHe started walking again, heading towards the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to see the place where he had once lain. This was his own explanation for heading there now, but in reality, it was a special feeling, as if by some unseen force, guiding him forward.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the morgue door. It had an electronic password lock. Coincidentally, Zhou Ze remembered the password. Doctors from other departments probably wouldn't have much interaction with this place, but Zhou Ze used to be in the emergency department. People brought to the emergency room were usually seriously injured or ill patients, and it was inevitable that some couldn't be saved and had to be taken here for placement.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also served as a police morgue. Some unidentified bodies or those that still needed \"processing\" would be temporarily placed here. This was common practice in many places; if local police stations lacked adequate facilities or forensic personnel, bodies were often kept in local funeral homes or hospitals.\n\nHe entered the password,\n\nthe lock clicked open,\n\nand Zhou Ze walked in.\n\nA chill came over him,\n\nnot the kind of cold that prickled the skin,\n\nbut a peculiar, eerie chill that seemed to suppress the warmth within your very soul.\n\nInside the morgue, of course, lay bodies. This was a temporary resting place for the deceased.\n\nLogically, there should have been an attendant outside, but for some reason, Zhou Ze hadn't seen anyone when he walked in. Perhaps the person was slacking off.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. Several bodies were laid out on cold gurneys, covered with white sheets. Another body was wrapped in a floral blanket, the kind used at home. From the silver hair visible on the exposed head, the deceased appeared to be an old grandmother.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze wasn't particularly afraid of corpses to begin with. What's more, he himself was now a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the refrigerated compartments, the kind that could be pulled out in layers.\n\nRefrigerated compartments containing bodies had labels on the outside, recording the body's name, gender, and other information.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty compartment, reached inside, closed his eyes, and slowly sensed. Gradually, a sense of intoxication arose, as if only here could he find peace.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Zhou Ze lay down inside.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe refrigerated compartment was slowly pushed in, until it closed completely.\n\nQuiet,\n\ncold,\n\nsilent,\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids,\n\nsleepiness washed over him,\n\nhe had finally found the feeling of sleep,\n\nbut he couldn't sleep just yet,\n\nbecause he didn't know,\n\nwho had just stood outside and helped push the compartment in............\n\n---\n[1] This is a colloquial Chinese idiom implying an improper, usually sexual, relationship between a brother-in-law and his wife's younger sister. The original term is a euphemism.\n[2] This is a Chinese idiom meaning someone is extremely timid, cowardly, or silent, unable to speak up or react even when provoked.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze's feet started kicking outwards from inside, intending to get himself out, but from outside came a \"click-clack\" sound, which meant the lock on the outside of the ice coffin had been fastened.\n\nLocked in, couldn't get out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt as if he had returned to the scene where he was once placed in a cramped coffin.\n\nHowever, this time, Zhou Ze wasn't frantic, nor was he enraged. He simply reached out and knocked on the metal plate near his head: \"Something wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't believe someone had come here to help him push the ice coffin in and then lock it. Unless that person was a mentally deranged lunatic, and Zhou Ze didn't think his luck would be that bad.\n\nMoreover,\n\nAfter he entered the mortuary, he had closed the door. A lunatic who knew the mortuary door's password?\n\nDo you believe it?\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze could only conclude that some kind of \"thing\" had \"helped\" him, and helped him thoroughly.\n\nHowever, after this inquiry, it remained silent outside.\n\nZhou Ze simply gave up, closed his eyes again, and prepared to get a good night's sleep.\n\nHe fell asleep very quickly this time.\n\nAfter all, he hadn't closed his eyes for two days, and a lot had happened in those two days; the accumulated fatigue was terrifying.\n\nEven if a flood covered the sky after I die,\n\nNobody can stop me from sleeping now.\n\n…………\n\nHe didn't know how long he had slept. When Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he only felt refreshed and invigorated, the long-lost energy returning, but unfortunately, his body was also frozen stiff.\n\nThe stiffness of his body was somewhat terrifying. Zhou Ze tried his best to wriggle his body a few times in the narrow space, and a series of \"crisp cracking\" sounds emanated, so comfortable that he unconsciously made a sound.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's fingernails naturally grew long and turned black, shimmering with an unusual luster. The stiffness in his body and the cold qi, unbearable for ordinary people, were slowly gathering towards his fingertips.\n\nThe entire process did not last long, but it made Zhou Ze no longer feel cold or uncomfortable.\n\nHe unconsciously kicked again with his foot, and the ice coffin naturally slid out.\n\nThe lock,\n\nwas it unlocked?\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. He sat up from the steel plate, got down, and then pushed it back in.\n\nHis clothes were stiff, hanging on him like cardboard, giving a very uncomfortable feeling. Zhou Ze's gaze swept around.\n\nThe mortuary of the Affiliated Hospital was not large; compared to those of big hospitals in major cities, it even seemed a bit modest, but there were still quite a few bodies stored inside.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure who had helped him push himself in earlier, and now trying to find them would indeed be difficult.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had unlocked the latch again while he was asleep, Zhou Ze didn't plan to cause any further trouble here.\n\nHe walked towards the mortuary door, intending to leave. However, as he passed the several beds covered with white sheets, Zhou Ze stopped.\n\nThe several bodies covered with white sheets showed nothing unusual,\n\nincluding the old woman wrapped in her family's floral cotton quilt; she also seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped,\n\nbecause he remembered that the old woman's head and feet were in reversed positions.\n\nIt was impossible for the mortuary attendant to run in while he was sleeping, do nothing else, and just flip the old woman around.\n\nZhou Ze stopped beside the old woman and said:\n\n\"If it's you, and you don't come out now, I'm leaving.\"\n\nThe old woman pushing him in and then locking him up earlier might have been malicious intent, but her silently unlocking him again meant she wasn't trying to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone was coming right away at that moment, and seeing an unlocked drawer, they might have discovered him.\n\nAfter all, whether these drawers were locked or unlocked was very obvious from the outside.\n\nAfter waiting for half a minute with no abnormalities, Zhou Ze decided not to wait anymore.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze strongly disliked this feeling,\n\nHesitant and prim,\n\nPlaying hard to get,\n\nClearly an old woman when she died, yet she insisted on acting like a young maiden.\n\nAlright, age discrimination is indeed wrong, but it's human nature for normal people to have a slightly higher tolerance for beautiful female ghosts.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian had a face full of wrinkles and yellow teeth, do you think Ning Cai Chen would still fall in love with her in a human-ghost romance?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked behind him.\n\nAn old woman with a head full of silver hair was crouching there, holding a washed-out white handkerchief and wiping away tears.\n\nBut ghosts don't have tears, so from Zhou Ze's perspective, the old woman seemed more like she was wailing dryly.\n\n\"You keep crying, I won't disturb you.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to leave.\n\nHe realized that he was, after all, a mortal, and even when looking at ghosts, he had a bit of aestheticism.\n\n\"Help me, I have money,\" the old woman suddenly said.\n\n\"Hm,\" Zhou Ze responded. He was short on money.\n\nDamn Xu Le's Alipay and WeChat combined had less than two hundred yuan, plus the eleven hundred yuan returned by that \"murderer,\" meaning Zhou Ze's total assets were now less than thirteen hundred yuan.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's house, savings, and accumulated wealth from his previous life should have all been donated to the orphanage, leaving him utterly alone.\n\n\"My money is in the hidden compartment of my cabinet. It's an old yellow-lacquered cabinet, with thirty thousand yuan inside. There's also my dowry from when I got married: a jade hairpin and a jade bracelet. I don't know how much they're worth.\n\nI died suddenly, and I didn't have time to tell my sons. I'm afraid they don't know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"I'll take a cut.\"\n\nThe old woman showed a look of struggle, but still nodded and said, \"That's only right.\"\n\nThe old woman knew that without Zhou Ze, this \"anomaly\" to relay the message, her sons might never find the property she left behind.\n\n………………\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zhou Ze directly took a taxi to a place called Xingdong Town in Tongzhou District. The distance wasn't very far; Tongcheng Airport was located in this town.\n\nEarlier at the hospital, Zhou Ze had inquired at the registration desk. The old woman had been sent to the hospital, died after unsuccessful resuscitation attempts, and then her family had simply abandoned the body at the hospital, still owing a sum in medical fees that hadn't been settled.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived in the town and, following the old woman's description, found the village.\n\nIt was a two-story house built by the family themselves, with a small brick outhouse-like structure attached to it.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived, he found several workers dismantling a house there, specifically the brick structure.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, offered a master worker a cigarette, and asked, \"It's almost Chinese New Year, still busy?\"\n\n\"Gotta make more money when New Year's coming up, anyway, we're all from the same village,\" the bricklayer master worker said casually.\n\n\"What's with this house?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking inside as he spoke. Two workers were already tearing off the roof, and the bricks from the small house's walls would be dismantled and saved for future use. Inside the house, let alone the yellow-lacquered cabinet the old woman mentioned, there wasn't even a small stool to be seen; it was completely empty.\n\n\"Their old mother died. This house used to be where their old mother lived alone. Now they plan to demolish it and build a new kitchen,\" the master worker leaned closer, letting Zhou Ze light his cigarette for him, smiling a bit reservedly, and said, \"Look, the one who just walked past in front of the house is their eldest son.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man, whose hair was also turning white, still had some bruises on his face.\n\n\"Five brothers, they fought over the meager money their old mother left behind. When these bricks are dismantled later, the other four will also come to claim their share.\n\nYou know, times have changed, haven't they? Their old mother's body is still at the hospital and hasn't been claimed yet, but none of the brothers are willing to pay back the medical fees owed.\"\n\n\"What about the things in the old woman's house?\" This was what Zhou Ze was concerned about. From the old woman's account, he knew that the thirty thousand yuan in the cabinet was the old woman's life savings, but the jade bracelet and jade hairpin were the truly valuable items; selling them off would likely net a few hundred thousand yuan without much trouble.\n\n\"Sold to the scrap collector, cleared out ages ago. They sold it when the old woman first got hospitalized,\" the master worker took another deep drag from his cigarette. \"I'm going to get back to work.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips, feeling a bit amused and helpless. This trip of his was pretty much for nothing.\n\nThe things the old woman left behind, not only did he not get a share, but even her sons didn't get to enjoy them; they just went cheap to some used furniture dealer.\n\nZhou Ze was now feeling rather vexed. No money, it really was a big problem. He wasn't willing to use his abilities to swindle money, and although that seemed simple and satisfying, saving a girl last night had almost made him die from the pain. Heaven knows what problems would arise if he continued to mess around.\n\nWhether there were deities three feet above his head, Zhou Ze didn't know,\n\nBut if one kept digging three feet down, there would definitely be hell, because he had been there.\n\nHe knew he wasn't human, and this place was the human world. Moreover, he vividly remembered how the patient who died in front of him earlier had screamed \"I've been found!\" in terror before dying.\n\nBut,\n\nMoney, ah,\n\nZhou Ze wanted to grind the mill,\n\nBut who would give him money?\n\nZhou Ze needed money now, not to mention getting rid of his \"live-in son-in-law\" status,\n\nAt least he needed to buy himself a freezer or a large refrigerator, right?\n\nOtherwise, he'd have to run to the hospital mortuary every day to sponge off the cold air?\n\nFeeling a bit depressed, he lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, only feeling immense vexation.\n\nJust then, his phone rang in his pocket. Zhou Ze picked it up. It was an unfamiliar number. He answered the call:\n\n\"Hello?\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Big Brother, the goods have been safely delivered. When are you coming to inspect them? The cops have been checking very strictly lately. This batch of goods wasn't easy to get in,\" the person on the other end of the phone said cautiously in a low voice.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nbut no sound came out.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nXu Le's image suddenly kept rising in stature in his mind.",

    "title": "Chapter 10: Big Shot!",
    "content": "Nervous, uneasy, yet with a hint of secret delight and confusion—this was probably how Zhou Ze felt on his taxi ride to the outskirts of Tongcheng.\n\nHe needed money, he really needed money, but he didn't need a lot of it. A large sum wouldn't do him much good, at least for now.\n\nBecause he had returned from the dead, with entanglements from his past life and troubles in this one, he needed money to resolve things. After that, he could make long-term plans, not squander it on an extravagant, indulgent life.\n\nFor instance, leaving the Lin family. Although Lin Wanqiu was beautiful and elegant, he really couldn't be bothered to go back to that home. They hadn't had any physical intimacy*, and he hadn't truly enjoyed himself. It seemed that scoundrel Xu Le hadn't truly enjoyed himself either, so there was certainly no debt of gratitude.\n\nTherefore, saying \"goodbye\" came with no psychological pressure.\n\nBut leaving that home meant making some preparations. He needed a place to stay, and he also had to buy a freezer of slightly better quality. Zhou Ze didn't dare to scour the second-hand market for discarded freezers. What if something went wrong, and he ended up playing himself to death by sleeping inside it? Wouldn't that be a huge loss?\n\nMoney!\n\nEven as a ghost, he needed money.\n\nHowever, hearing the way that person spoke on the phone to Xu Le made Zhou Ze uneasy again. Xu Le, with his identity as a modern urban live-in son-in-law*, so pathetic that he let his in-laws ride roughshod over him* at home, so pathetic that he slept in a separate bed from his wife—could he actually be a hidden underworld boss?\n\nWell, that kind of contrasting imagery was really exciting and very much in the style of American TV shows. Awesome characters always had a mundane real-life identity.\n\nLike Spider-Man being a middle school student, or Superman being a newspaper reporter.\n\nSo, how should he handle this situation?\n\nHow to deal with that bunch?\n\nZhou Ze didn't want his current identity to be \"defiled,\" because that would mean endless trouble. In the real world, the police investigation of him was already something Xu Le couldn't easily handle, not to mention those people the old man and the faceless woman had called out, who \"will discover and will catch you.\"\n\nFeeling a bit of a headache and somewhat unaccustomed to things, Zhou Ze still arrived at the abandoned small fertilizer plant.\n\nTwo men were squatting at the entrance of the fertilizer plant. One wore a somewhat worn military greatcoat, and the other wore a cheap, poor-quality suit.\n\nBoth were squatting there, a cigarette clutched in their mouths, puffing away.\n\nZhou Ze paid the fare and got out of the car. The men immediately stood up and walked toward him.\n\n\"Our boss is waiting for you,\" the man in the military greatcoat said in a deep voice.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and followed the man in the military greatcoat inside. The man in the suit continued to squat there, smoking, as if keeping watch.\n\nUpon entering, Zhou Ze saw a bald fat man wearing a thick gold chain, sitting on a plastic chair, pouring and drinking by himself. Seeing Zhou Ze approach, the fat man immediately stood up.\n\n\"Brother Xu, you're finally here.\"\n\nThe fat man was very tall, 1.85 meters, and his gold chain was very thick, looking quite ostentatious. The gold powder rubbed off on his neck by the chain was even more so.\n\n\"Where's the goods?\"\n\nZhou Ze clasped his hands lightly behind his back. There were only three people here; taking them down together wouldn't be a problem. But what then? Handing them over to the police would surely get him implicated too, wouldn't it?\n\nShould he handle them vigilante style? \"In the name of the Moon, I will punish them!\"* That didn't seem right either. Given his sensitive identity, arbitrarily killing people might lead to repercussions, just like arbitrarily saving people. He was unwilling to try it lightly.\n\n\"Brother Xu is as straightforward as ever!\"\n\nThe fat man wiped his mouth, then reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched. He took a deep breath, forcing himself not to bat away the fat man's greasy, fleshy hand.\n\n\"Come, over here!\"\n\nThe fat man made an inviting gesture and led Zhou Ze to a small storeroom in the back courtyard.\n\nStepping inside,\n\nZhou Ze's pupils suddenly constricted.\n\nPiled up like a small mountain were the \"goods,\" covered with black tarpaulin.\n\nZhou Ze had never done anything illegal before, but he knew that with this much \"goods,\" legally speaking, it was enough to get him executed hundreds of times over. He could eat enough peanuts to bloat his stomach.*\n\n\"It's not just Tongcheng, is it?\" Zhou Ze really wanted to ask, *Did you just rob a warlord from the Golden Triangle?*\n\n\"Brother Xu, of course. Tongcheng is still too small. This batch of goods will eventually use Tongcheng as a springboard to flow into Shanghai.\" The fat man stretched. \"This time, let's seize the moment and quickly move the goods. We can make a huge profit.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and rubbed his forehead, saying with difficulty, \"It'll be hard to move all of this in a short time, won't it?\"\n\nAfter all, they weren't selling Chinese cabbage, riding a tricycle and shouting into a loudspeaker.\n\n\"Don't worry, Brother Xu. We just need to distribute this batch of goods to our subordinates. Although the profit isn't as high as selling it ourselves, it's fast and guaranteed to move. Once this batch is done, we'll get another one.\" The fat man said nonchalantly.\n\nXu Le, oh Xu Le, you even built a drug trafficking network? You're truly something else...\n\nSuch a big shot, yet he was actually clubbed to death by that imbecile just for three hundred kuai!\n\n\"Brother Xu, come and see the quality of this batch.\"\n\nAs the fat man spoke, he lifted the tarpaulin.\n\nThen, an expression of surprise appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\n\nBecause what he saw wasn't a mountain of illicit drugs, but stacks of books and optical discs.\n\n*Could it be hidden between the pages of the books?*\n\n\"Brother Xu, thanks to your classmate's connections, this batch was easy to get. These discs are popular movies still showing in cinemas. I even specially copied several ***** into them. These pirated books and romance novels are also best-selling works on the market.\n\nAnd Brother Xu, you specially wrote the expanded sequel to *Bai Jie*—twenty volumes, two million characters. Many of our distributors pre-ordered this one. No worries about it not selling.\"\n\n\"The 'goods' you're talking about, are they these?\" Zhou Ze asked the fat man.\n\n\"Yes?\" The fat man was stunned for a moment. \"Just these.\"\n\nDisappointment.\n\nGreat disappointment.\n\nProfound disappointment.\n\nAnd at the same time, deep embarrassment.\n\nXu Le was Xu Le after all. For the sake of selling these pirated items, he actually continued to write the story of *Bai Jie* himself.\n\nAnd he even wrote a two-million-character sequel.\n\nJust how much free time did he have...?\n\n\"How much can I withdraw?\" Zhou Ze asked, \"I plan to pull out.\"\n\nWhen doing business together, there should have been initial capital investment.\n\n\"What? Brother Xu, you're planning to pull out?\" The fat man sounded surprised. \"We're just waiting to make money now! You're pulling out at this point?\"\n\n\"Yes, this matter doesn't quite align with my core values. I don't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze said very seriously. He didn't want to take any risk, especially not before sorting out his current life. He didn't want to get involved in any potential vortex.\n\n\"...\" The fat man.\n\n\"...\" The military greatcoat.\n\n\"Brother Xu has high principles, I admire that. In the early stages, Brother Xu invested...\"\n\nThe fat man held up four fingers and said, \"Twenty thousand kuai.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand it is then. Give me the money, and the rest has nothing to do with me.\" Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to argue about it anymore. Getting twenty thousand kuai would at least solve his current urgent need*.\n\n\"Alright, I do have twenty thousand kuai here.\" The fat man nodded and went to get the money.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze, with twenty thousand kuai tucked in his pocket, hailed a ride-share and started heading back to the city.\n\nHe wasn't in a hurry to return to the bookstore first. Instead, he went to an appliance market and spent over ten thousand kuai on a freezer. This type of freezer was generally used by businesses to store food ingredients and meat products, and it was one of the higher-end models. Zhou Ze didn't begrudge the expense; after all, he would have to rely on it to sleep from now on, and he was afraid cheap ones might break down.\n\nThe salesperson was very enthusiastic and sent a small truck to deliver the freezer directly to... the bookstore entrance.\n\nAfter the driver and Zhou Ze moved the freezer into the bookstore, the driver looked a bit bewildered.\n\n\"Boss, you run a bookstore, and you need a freezer?\" the driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed him a cigarette. \"Business isn't easy. I plan to moonlight selling seafood.\"\n\nThe driver took the cigarette and left. The goods were delivered; he didn't need to worry about anything else.\n\nThe bookstore had a small mezzanine, which Xu Le had originally used to store books. After Zhou Ze cleaned it out, he placed the freezer there. Looking at his \"new bed,\" Zhou Ze finally felt much more at ease.\n\nComing down from the mezzanine, Zhou Ze found someone in his bookstore. It wasn't a customer; it was his \"wife.\"\n\nDoctor Lin was flipping through a magazine. Seeing Zhou Ze come down, she asked, a little confused, \"What were you busy with upstairs?\"\n\n\"Organizing inventory,\" Zhou Ze answered perfunctorily.\n\n\"I'm off work,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Mm.\" *Off work, but still not sleeping with me...* (Zhou Ze's internal thought)\n\n\"That girl woke up.\" Doctor Lin looked pointedly at Zhou Ze. \"Her father wants to treat our department to dinner at the Tongcheng Grand Hotel. You should come too.\"\n\n\"What would I do there?\"\n\n\"After the girl woke up, she kept calling 'Uncle'.\" Doctor Lin asked Zhou Ze, a little curiously, \"Did you know her before?\"\n\n\"Even when people are in a coma, they still have some perception, right?\" Zhou Ze continued to make things up. \"When I saved her, she might have actually been able to sense it.\"\n\n\"Are you coming?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"No, I'm not going,\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not hungry. I have no appetite at all.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded and didn't insist further. She seemed ready to leave, but at the bookstore entrance, she stopped. \"Are you coming home tonight?\"\n\nThe familiar old question again.\n\n*I come home, and you still don't sleep with me...*\n\nSo, Zhou Ze answered decisively:\n\n\"No, I won't. I'm a bit busy lately.\"\n\n*Hmm, even though business at the shop has grown as cold as an iced latte.*\n\nDoctor Lin hesitated for a moment, didn't insist, and took her car keys out of her pocket, preparing to leave.\n\nJust then,\n\n*Clang!*\n\nDoctor Lin turned around and saw her \"husband\" had collapsed onto a bookshelf, books scattered all over the floor.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Doctor Lin immediately rushed over to check on Zhou Ze's condition.\n\nZhou Ze felt his eyes begin to blur, his vision difficult to focus. His chest heaved, and his legs suddenly went weak. It was like he had stepped on cotton and completely lost his balance:\n\n\"Fainted from hunger...\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe,\n\nhadn't eaten for several days.\n\n***\n\nFive days since release, ranked second on the overall new book chart for the same period!\n\nIn the Supernatural category, aside from the monthly ticket chart where you can't vote until the book is officially released, we're first on all other charts!\n\nYesterday, daily sales ranked second on Qidian! Today, daily sales ranked eleventh on Qidian!\n\nAs a new book of 30,000 characters that hasn't been officially released yet, Long* just wants to say,\n\nBrothers,\n\nAwesome!\n\n---\n*   *Physical intimacy*: The Chinese idiom “肌膚之親 (jīfū zhī qīn)” literally means “skin-to-skin closeness” and refers to intimate relations, especially between a married couple.\n*   *Live-in son-in-law*: In China, a “贅婿 (zhuìxù)” is a man who marries into his wife's family and often takes her family name, typically due to his own lack of wealth or status.

    "content": "Next to the bookstore was a noodle shop, whose business was actually just so-so, almost like Zhou Ze's bookstore, with few customers passing through its doors.\n\nBecause this pedestrian street was originally built around the periphery of a plaza center, but this plaza center had already gone \"defunct\"; inside, except for a cinema, all other businesses had moved out or closed down, and as a result, the entire plaza had almost become a \"seldom-visited\" desolate area.\n\nAt least here in Tongcheng, the symptoms of urban overdevelopment had already manifested. In previous years, commercial centers were extensively built and planned, but Tongcheng was not Shanghai after all, and couldn't attract so much foot traffic.\n\nBut fortunately, this noodle shop could still do delivery business, and business seemed to be pretty good, but obviously, no one would suddenly feel \"spiritually hungry\" and then order a few books for delivery to nibble on.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back in his chair, still feeling a bit dizzy. Doctor Lin sat across from Zhou Ze, helping him wipe the chopsticks with her own tissue before placing them in front of him.\n\nShe was very meticulous, and also very considerate, just as she let Xu Le sleep on the bed while she slept on the floor, but she was also very cold at the same time.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother to ask if she was truly against feudal arranged marriages or if she was simply a lesbian herself, because there was no point in asking that question. Zhou Ze himself wasn't interested in the bizarre family network Xu Le had left behind, nor did he feel any attachment to it.\n\n\"Is your body really alright?\" Doctor Lin asked again.\n\n\"Minor issue, minor issue.\" Zhou Ze himself was a doctor; he knew that his issues with eating and sleeping were difficult to explain with modern medical theories, let alone to treat.\n\nFortunately, his sleeping problem was now settled, but this eating... it was a headache.\n\nIf he didn't eat, he'd just fainted, but the mere thought of eating... would start to make him nauseous.\n\n\"Loss of appetite? Have a bowl of sour plum juice first.\" The noodle shop owner was around thirty years old, but his face already had some wrinkles. The burdens of life seemed truly heavy.\n\n\"Sour plum juice, is it useful?\" Zhou Ze asked, feeling somewhat helpless.\n\n\"It stimulates appetite.\" The noodle shop owner smiled, then called towards the back room: \"Wifey, is the Potherb Mustard Noodle ready?\"\n\nThe owner walked into the back room, and the voices of the couple talking came from there.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the sour plum juice in front of him, picked up a spoon, scooped out a mouthful, and put it into his mouth. As soon as he swallowed, Zhou Ze's expression changed.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Doctor Lin pulled out a tissue and held it to Zhou Ze's chin.\n\nZhou Ze twisted his face and clutched his stomach,\n\nthen took a deep breath and said:\n\n\"It's really sour.\"\n\nYes, it was so sour that his whole body felt like it was going into spasms, even overriding the nausea.\n\n\"Here it is, the noodles are here.\" The proprietress came over, carrying the noodles, and put them down in front of Zhou Ze, saying at the same time: \"My family's sour plum juice can't be drunk so quickly.\"\n\nDoctor Lin looked at the noodles, frowning slightly: \"These noodles, they're boiled too mushy.\"\n\nMeaning they were cooked for too long, the noodles had lost their chewiness, which greatly affected the texture.\n\n\"Well... that's just how our noodles are,\" the proprietress said, a look of shame on her face.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand. Whether they were mushy or chewy had no meaning for him right now; as long as he could eat them, that was enough. He needed energy; if he couldn't eat anymore, Zhou Ze would have no choice but to go to the hospital for a glucose injection.\n\nHe raised his head very solemnly; Zhou Ze felt as solemn and grave as a commando, then suddenly lowered his head again, and poured that incredibly sour bowl of sour plum juice into his mouth in one go.\n\nHiss...\n\nThat sour sensation,\n\nwas like pouring sulfuric acid into his stomach and intestines.\n\nBut next, Zhou Ze directly picked up his chopsticks, forked up the noodles and sent them into his mouth. He devoured them as ravenously as possible. In five or six mouthfuls, a bowl of noodles was sent into his belly. Immediately after, he picked up the bowl and poured all the noodle soup into himself.\n\nWhoosh...\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nZhou Ze put down the empty noodle bowl,\n\nlet out a long breath. He'd eaten it!\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze reached out and clutched his chest. The nausea, suppressed by the sour plum soup, surged back again, but the food was already in his stomach. Zhou Ze almost choked himself with both hands to keep from throwing up again.\n\nNot throwing up was a success;\n\nthe food,\n\nwas finally down.\n\nSweat beads had already soaked his forehead. He picked up a tissue from the table and directly wiped it off.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nDoctor Lin and the proprietress were both a little stunned; Zhou Ze's eating manner just now was truly too alarming.\n\n\"Heh heh, looks like you were truly hungry. Would you like another bowl?\" the proprietress asked.\n\n\"No, no need.\" Zhou Ze refused.\n\n\"Alrighty then.\" The proprietress cleared the bowls and chopsticks from in front of Zhou Ze, and called towards the back room: \"His dad, knead the dough for the afternoon's noodles well, delivery orders should be coming soon.\"\n\nThe proprietress walked inside. Her back view couldn't be described as graceful, and her appearance could only be considered ordinary. But what was remarkable was her weighty bosom and high, firm lower body, which instead added a special charm, exceptionally attractive.\n\n\"Do you like... this type?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze had been watching the proprietress as she went into the back room.\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. *I actually like your type, but you won't let me sleep with you.*\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled inwardly. The thought of \"not being allowed to sleep with her\" had been in his mind for a long time, almost becoming an obsession. He had to admit, Doctor Lin was indeed very beautiful, and she was still young.\n\nEven though she was Xu Le's wife,\n\neven though Zhou Ze hadn't been married in his previous life,\n\nbut frankly speaking,\n\nhe still wanted to sleep with her.\n\nPrecisely because he couldn't, he was conflicted and constantly thought about it.\n\n\"Not going home?\" Doctor Lin asked again.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"Then I'll leave.\" Doctor Lin stood up. \"Call me if anything happens.\"\n\nAfter all, he was her nominal husband, even if there was no marital intimacy.\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"If I'd known you were so easy to talk to and so considerate, I should've borrowed some money from you when I was broke.\"\n\nDoctor Lin left, driving away in her Porsche Cayenne.\n\nZhou Ze, however, still sat inside the noodle shop. His bookstore was right next door. Even though he had finished eating the noodles, it was fine to sit and chat here; after all, they were neighbors.\n\nThe owner came out from the back room and offered Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n\"How much?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"You're too polite. Brother can still afford to treat you to a bowl of noodles.\" The owner waved his hand grandly. \"We're all neighbors. We'll be seeing each other all the time; no need to become strangers over a bowl of noodles.\"\n\n\"Won't your wife scold you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No, she won't. What does a woman know? She has no right to speak.\" The noodle shop owner's chauvinistic aura was palpable.\n\nA man, no matter what his status at home, always had to put on a show outside. No one was willing to admit they were afraid of their wife in public, just as no one was willing to admit they were impotent.\n\n\"Heh heh, your wife is quite pretty,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nTeasing someone about their wife was a taboo. If two men faced outwards and joked about a woman walking by on the street, that was a topic of interest between men.\n\nThe owner paused, said nothing, and just smiled. The owner had a good temper; people who generally ran small businesses always understood the principle of \"harmony brings wealth.\"\n\n\"Her figure is very good.\" Zhou Ze continued, \"Solid and flavorful, just like the noodles I just ate.\"\n\nThe owner took a heavy drag from his cigarette.\n\n\"How is she in bed?\" Zhou Ze asked again. This time, he pushed even further.\n\nThe owner slightly clenched his fist, but quickly said with an air of nonchalance: \"Her legs, oh, they could squeeze a person to death, powerful!\"\n\nZhou Ze laughed,\n\nthe owner also laughed.\n\n\"Can you keep up?\" Zhou Ze asked again. \"She's probably at the age where she wants it, right?\"\n\nThe owner pounded his lower back. \"Can't keep up anymore, not a young lad anymore.\"\n\n\"Then, how about I give it a try?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe owner's face completely darkened.\n\nHis knuckles creaked as he clenched them.\n\n\"If you can't, I can. I'm still young,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself. Although, these words were a bit disingenuous. Xu Le's physique, even if young, felt like a \"silver spear, wax head,\"¹ not nearly as well-maintained as Zhou Ze's own body in his previous life.\n\n\"Isn't that joke going too far?\" The owner was still holding back his anger.\n\n\"What if your wife agrees?\" Zhou Ze continued.\n\n\"Was that your wife just now?\" The owner changed the subject.\n\n\"Mm-hm.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Would you be willing to give her up?\" The owner asked again.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. Although she was Xu Le's wife, she was now nominally his own, and Zhou Ze was unwilling.\n\n\"Then why do you think I'd be willing?\" the owner retorted.\n\n\"Who knows, maybe you have some special preferences or unusual fetishes? There's no shortage of such things nowadays, isn't that right?\"\n\n\"Brother, it's been a long time since your elder brother laid hands on someone.\" The owner stood up.\n\n\"You stand right here and call her out.\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"You're asking for death!\" The owner lunged forward.\n\n\"Can she come out?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\nThe owner froze,\n\nthen a look of terror appeared on his face, and he stumbled back several steps in fright.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked actively towards the back room. He lifted the curtain; inside, there was no one.\n\nOnly a woman's human skin,\n\nhung on a clothes hanger,\n\nand because the opened curtain allowed wind to enter,\n\nit gently swayed,\n\nslowly drifting.\n\n\"How did you... how did you figure it out?\" The owner slowly walked over. From his voice, neither joy nor anger could be discerned.\n\n\"There's a saying... are you trying to fool a ghost?\"² Zhou Ze turned around, looking at the owner. \"This skin on you, it's time to tear it off, isn't it?\n\nI'm very curious,\n\nhow bored you must be,\n\nto be here,\n\nputting on such a 'two-man act'.\"\n\n---\n¹ \"Silver spear, wax head\" (銀槍蠟頭): An idiom describing someone or something that appears outwardly impressive or strong but is actually impotent or lacking in substance.\n² \"Are you trying to fool a ghost?\" (你糊弄鬼呢?): An idiom used to indicate that the speaker is fully aware of the deception or trick being attempted and implies that the deceiver is foolish for trying.",

    "content": "The boss smiled, not feeling the slightest bit provoked; he just found it a bit amusing.\n\nA person's temperament and aura often hold more credibility than their words.\n\n\"Rip...\"\n\nA crisp sound, with a hint of a prolonged quality, like a snake shedding its skin. He began to tear off the skin on his body.\n\nAt the same time, the boss's figure and bone structure were slowly shrinking, and his physique was gradually slimming down, like a balloon with a small hole, slowly deflating.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood why that bowl of noodles had been cooked so mushy.\n\nThis \"transformation\" of the other party indeed required some time.\n\nStill wearing the boss's clothes and apron, the other party's face had transformed into a slightly youthful man.\n\nA smile played on the young man's lips, his alluring charm innately natural, especially the curve extending from the corner of his eyes, as if it could scratch the itchy spots in the hearts of both men and women around him, perfectly appropriate, just right.\n\nFor a man, describing him as \"alluring\" is a bit incongruous, but some men are indeed born with a natural charm. For instance, among ancient emperors, countless numbers favored male companions, and the reason truly lies in the fact that some men are more like women than women themselves.\n\n\"Do I look good?\" the young man asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt the nausea he had suppressed after eating the noodles return. He waved his hand with a slight apology, then clutched his chest, adopting a posture of \"I cannot vomit.\"\n\nWho knows that every grain on the plate comes from hardship!¹\n\nZhou Ze deeply cherished food, especially the food he had just managed to swallow and was about to be digested into energy within his body.\n\nThe young man sat down on a nearby chair, casually twirling a lighter in his hand.\n\nHe was scrutinizing Zhou Ze, because Zhou Ze had discovered him. He had believed his imitation was flawless, and being in this small eatery, there shouldn't have been any problems.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nhe was imitating his own parents.\n\nSince he was young, he had been observing his parents; their every move and action, every wisp of expression, had long been etched in his heart.\n\n\"How did you discover me?\" The young man couldn't help but ask.\n\n\"You're not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze also asked at the same time.\n\nThe young man frowned slightly, thinking Zhou Ze was mocking him, accusing him of playing tricks.\n\nBut in reality, Zhou Ze had considered him a ghost from the very beginning.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to meddle in other people's business. As someone who not long ago was still concerned about the cost of a freezer, Zhou Ze didn't believe he had the right to meddle.\n\nBut he couldn't just ignore this matter either.\n\nThe matter was happening right next door to him.\n\nSo Zhou Ze felt that, no matter what, it was better to just expose the truth first. If it was easy to resolve, he would resolve it himself. If not, at worst, he would just move again.\n\n\"Your fingernails,\" Zhou Ze said. \"I'm a bit sensitive to fingernails.\"\n\nThe boss's wife brought the noodles to him.\n\nThe boss personally offered him a cigarette.\n\nThe fingernails were all presented before him.\n\nAlthough the fingers differed in thickness, paleness, and the degree of calluses, the patterns on the fingernail beds were the same.\n\nAnd lately, Zhou Ze had paid more attention to fingernails, not just his own, but also others'.\n\nThe young man's eyes narrowed slightly; he looked forlorn. The details, they weren't executed perfectly.\n\nAlthough he had been a bit lax, the fact that it was discovered meant it was indeed his oversight.\n\n\"You're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nIf he was human, then that would be truly unbelievable.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze hadn't seen many ghosts. Setting aside his journey in hell, the ghosts he had seen in the mortal world were truly few and far between.\n\n\"The Painted Skin technique² is an inherited skill from my family,\" the young man stood up, reached out and grabbed Zhou Ze's hand, placing it on his own chest. \"It's just that it's been lost for many generations, and only in my generation was I able to pick it up again.\"\n\nThis action was a bit intimate, and a bit out of line, but Zhou Ze still subconsciously squeezed it with his hand.\n\nZhou Ze would never think it was because Doctor Lin never let him sleep that he was now developing an interest in men.\n\nOf course, this man in front of him was indeed more alluring than women; this was truly a fact.\n\n\"No bones?\" Zhou Ze's face showed surprise. \"No, it's soft bone disease.³\"\n\nSoft bone disease is also known as rickets. Due to calcium deficiency hindering bone calcification, the bones soften and easily deform. Zhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he naturally knew a bit about it. But just as even a common cold has many different situations and pathologies, soft bone disease also has many subcategories, and this young man in front of him seemed to be an extreme case.\n\nLegend has it that unofficial histories from the Spring and Autumn period record a prince from the State of Lu who suffered from this disease. His body was delicate and pliable, able to walk like a human and also crawl like a snake.\n\n\"You can understand this as a genetic disease that only manifests with a certain probability. Many generations before me in my family couldn't master the Painted Skin technique because they didn't have this disease, and I…\" The young man smiled, not continuing.\n\n\"So, you're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze was still not convinced.\n\n\"My name is Xu Qinglang,\" the young man replied very seriously.\n\n\"And who were you imitating?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Dad, Mom.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused for a moment, showing a wry smile.\n\nWell then,\n\nthis was a huge misunderstanding.\n\nAfter finishing the noodles earlier, and after Sister Lin left, Zhou Ze had wanted to get to the bottom of things⁴ and deliberately provoked him with words. He never expected that the person was just bored and playing role-play here, commemorating his deceased parents.\n\nBut from Zhou Ze's previous perspective, he had just taken for granted that this was a ghost, similar to the ghost in the \"Painted Skin\" story, who killed people, skinned them, and was still acting like an ape in a human cap.⁵\n\n\"Well... my apologies.\"\n\nMaking a joke about your mother, that's truly a bit embarrassing.\n\n\"I'm not angry,\" Xu Qinglang said. \"But I'm very curious, what do you mean by always treating me as a ghost?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Have you seen ghosts?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I am a ghost,\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang and said very seriously.\n\nHis expression was solemn, his demeanor dignified.\n\nHe was speaking from the heart.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression froze,\n\nthen he couldn't help but let out a puff of laughter,\n\nhis gaze towards Zhou Ze,\n\nwas as if looking at an imbecile.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Sometimes, that's just how it is: you tell them the truth, they think you're teasing them, and they won't believe it.\n\n\"Anyway, my apologies. Oh right, I also wanted to ask, that human skin, was it real human skin?\" Zhou Ze asked curiously.\n\n\"Fish skin,\" Xu Qinglang replied. \"Processed, painted, and made.\"\n\n\"Then why are you selling noodles?\" Zhou Ze found it a bit hard to understand. \"I heard that a snake skin garment from the Hezhen ethnic group can sell for a lot of money, sold as artwork. Yours should be worth even more, right?\"\n\n\"Ancestral items, I can't bring myself to use them for profit.\"\n\n\"Then you must be very rich,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"My family just had a demolition and relocation,\" Xu Qinglang didn't answer directly. \"We received over twenty apartments.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nSo, the world is just this unfair. He worked hard at the hospital in his previous life and didn't earn much money, while others casually got over twenty apartments.\n\nTongcheng is not like Shanghai, but house prices are also nearly 10,000 yuan per square meter.\n\nDemolition rich kids, how envious!\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Will you still continue to make noodles in the future?\"\n\n\"Will you still continue to sell books in the future?\"\n\nThe two of them simultaneously asked each other questions.\n\n\"We'll see for now,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Me too.\"\n\n\"Well then, see you later. Oh right, does your family's plum juice have other flavors?\" Zhou Ze was very curious about this. \"For example, bitter gourd flavored? Grape flavored?\"\n\n\"I have a secret recipe, I can make it,\" Xu Qinglang said very honestly.\n\n\"Very good.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\nDamn it,\n\nit was like cotton,\n\nsoft and floppy, truly delicate and boneless. If this were to be held in one's arms and brought to bed...\n\nZhou Ze immediately conjured up the image of Doctor Lin emerging from the shower in her pajamas in his mind, forcefully suppressing those \"disharmonious thoughts\" of his.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the noodle shop.\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the inner room, lifted the curtain, and said to the woman's \"skin\" hanging inside:\n\n\"Mom, do you think he really believed it, or was he just pretending to?\"\n\nThe woman's skin gently swayed,\n\nlightly swaying,\n\nas if saying, he didn't believe it,\n\nor as if saying, she didn't know either.\n\n……………………\n\nZhou Ze returned to his shop. The freezer was already settled in. Next, he really needed to renovate the dilapidated bookstore Xu Le had left behind. Letting it continue to lose money like this was not an option.\n\nThe sign at the bookstore's entrance read \"Xu Le's Study,\" as rustic as rustic could be.\n\nAll in all, this bookstore in that guy's hands, from top to bottom, from inside out, exuded an aura of \"guaranteed loss.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down in front of the computer and tried to log into his original QQ account several times, but couldn't. Identity verification simply wouldn't pass, and appeals were basically useless.\n\nAfterwards, Zhou Ze could only go out and take a taxi. He planned to change the sign, or put up a couplet at the entrance.\n\nHe knew an owner of a plaque shop who specialized in wooden carved plaques. The shop owner was an old man who often donated to that orphanage. When Zhou Ze himself was a member of the orphanage back then, the old man was already donating. After Zhou Ze started working, the old man and Zhou Ze donated together.\n\nThat plaque shop wasn't far; it was right at the foot of Langshan Mountain. All around it were shops selling incense and candles; only this one sold plaques.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked in, he found that the shop was undergoing a major cleanup, and even the plaques had been taken down.\n\nA middle-aged man was directing workers there.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the other party asked upon seeing Zhou Ze approach.\n\n\"I'm looking for Old Man Zhao,\" Zhou Ze said. He held great respect for that old man.\n\n\"I'm sorry, my father just passed away last month,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"Passed away?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised and sad. He wasn't really close with Old Man Zhao; they just knew of each other's existence. Because of that, it was normal that he wasn't notified about the funeral.\n\nMoreover, perhaps for Old Man Zhao's family, since Old Man Zhao had always donated his plaque-making income to the orphanage, they naturally didn't have a good impression of the orphanage, and wouldn't even notify the orphanage about the funeral, for fear that the orphanage would come asking for money again.\n\n\"Are you here to order a plaque?\" the middle-aged man asked.\n\n\"Mm-hmm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Our family isn't doing it anymore,\" the middle-aged man said apologetically. \"From now on, we'll be selling incense and candles.\"\n\nLangshan is one of the ten small Buddhist mountains. Even if it doesn't attract many outside tourists, local people going to burn incense and worship Buddha during festivals and holidays is enough for the shops and businesses located at the foot of the mountain to make a huge profit.\n\nThis is also a form of living off the land, utilizing local resources.\n\n\"That's a pity,\" Zhou Ze felt a bit regretful.\n\nHe planned to go see the old man's tombstone.\n\n\"However, there are still a few plaques my father made before at home that couldn't be sold. I also don't know why my father carved those plaques, and they weren't custom orders. If you like them, I can sell them to you cheaply.\" The middle-aged man planned to dispose of them, thinking of them as scrap.\n\n\"Okay, I'll take a look,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nHe followed the middle-aged man to a small courtyard in the back. The middle-aged man opened a storage room and turned on the light.\n\nInside were some miscellaneous items, including Old Man Zhao's tools for his craft, piled up haphazardly, indicating that the descendants had no intention of inheriting this craft.\n\nNowadays, everyone makes illuminated signs; who would still want to use this? It's hard work and doesn't earn much money.\n\n\"Whoosh...\" The middle-aged man blew a puff of air at the several plaques on the ground and said, \"Have a look. Two hundred yuan each. If you like it, you can take it. If you don't, then forget it.\"\n\nObviously, the middle-aged man had no confidence in whether he could sell these plaques.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and took a look.\n\nThe first plaque read:\n\n\"Life and death are fated; wealth and honor are in Heaven's hands.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. The middle-aged man sighed, knowing this plaque was a lost cause.\n\nThe next one read:\n\n\"Humans know ghosts are terrifying; ghosts know human hearts are venomous.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled. He was a bit sensitive to this.\n\nThe middle-aged man didn't sigh this time, because he knew it was a definite no-go. Who on earth would open a shop and be so foolish as to hang this at their entrance?\n\nThe third one:\n\n\"Listen to it as a fable; thus have I heard.⁶\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nThe middle-aged man saw Zhou Ze smile, and he also smiled.\n\nAt least one was satisfied.\n***\n¹ _Literally: \"Who knows that the food in the plate, every grain is hard work!\" A Chinese proverb emphasizing the value of labor and the importance of cherishing food._\n² _Painted Skin: A reference to a classic Chinese tale (and associated techniques) where a demon disguises itself in a human skin, often acquired from a victim._\n³ _Soft bone disease: A general term for conditions where bones are abnormally soft. The description \"due to calcium deficiency hindering bone calcification\" specifically refers to rickets (in children) or osteomalacia (in adults). The context of being \"boneless\" is an extreme fictional manifestation of such a condition._\n⁴ _To get to the bottom of things: An adaptation of \"捅破窗戶紙\" (tǒngpò chuānghùzhǐ), literally \"to poke a hole in the window paper,\" an idiom meaning to reveal the truth, to stop beating around the bush._\n⁵ _An ape in a human cap: An adaptation of \"沐猴而冠\" (mùhóu ércuàn), literally \"a monkey wearing a hat/crown,\" an idiom used to describe someone dressed in fine clothes but still appearing crude or out of place, or holding a high position but lacking the necessary qualities._\n⁶ _Listen to it as a fable; thus have I heard: A playful combination of two phrases. \"姑妄聽之\" (gūwàng tīng zhī) means \"listen to it as idle talk\" or \"take it with a grain of salt,\" implying skepticism. \"如是我聞\" (rúshì wǒ wén) is a Buddhist phrase meaning \"Thus have I heard,\" used to introduce scriptures, implying reverence and truth._",

    "content": "Zhou Ze brought the plaques back and planned to nail them on either side. He didn't care which one went on the left or the right.\n\nThe young man next door, Xu Qinglang, was very enthusiastic.\n\nHe was originally squatting at his doorway peeling garlic. Seeing Zhou Ze about to hang the plaques, he immediately went into his room and brought out a hammer and nails.\n\nZhou Ze said thank you, picked up the hammer, and felt it was a bit greasy and heavy in his hand. Enduring a slight discomfort, Zhou Ze still nailed the two plaques into place.\n\nAfterward,\n\nThe two of them stepped back a few paces, looking at the plaques, looking at the door, looking at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze handed Xu Qinglang a cigarette as thanks, and Xu Qinglang helped Zhou Ze light his.\n\nThe two of them blew out smoke rings together,\n\nPerfectly in sync.\n\n\"The vibe, it's there, right?\" Zhou Ze said, a classic example of self-praise.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"If I'm not mistaken, these two lines should be from the volume title of Ji Yun's *Yuewei Caotang Biji*.\"\n\n*Yuewei Caotang Biji* is a collection of stories written by Ji Yun, also known as Ji Xiaolan, similar to *Liaozhai Zhiyi* (Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio), which uses tales of fox spirits and ghosts to express the author's own thoughts.\n\nIn short, the meaning of this couplet is: these are all stories I've heard; for everyone here, just listen to them.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"It's still too literary. Your shop is still going to lose money.\" Xu Qinglang's assessment was quite blunt.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There are too many stories in this world; all sorts of strange and bizarre things happen every day, but there aren't many that truly interest people.\n\nSome things are pointless to talk about.\n\nSome things are absolutely forbidden to talk about.\n\nSome things, if you don't change them, no one will listen.\n\nSome things, if you don't change them, people wouldn't dare listen.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang for a long time.\n\nXu Qinglang lowered his head slightly, a blush spreading across his face.\n\nHe naturally embodied a feminine charm in his male body, born alluring, and at this moment, he was even more exquisitely charming.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze remain silent, Xu Qinglang continued:\n\n\"For example, things like mountain spirits, fox spirits, and ghosts, where would they truly exist in the real world?\" Xu Qinglang yawned. \"The truths conveyed through fictional tales, how real could they possibly be?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to look at Xu Qinglang, remaining silent.\n\nXu Qinglang felt a prickling sensation on his scalp from the gaze,\n\nBut Zhou Ze continued to look at him.\n\nFinally, Xu Qinglang waved his hand and said he was going back to make soup base. As he walked back to his noodle shop, he felt a prickling sensation on his back, because just now, it had felt as if Zhou Ze wasn't looking at him,\n\nBut rather, looking at a joke.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother with Xu Qinglang. Since they were neighbors, they could just mind their own business. Anyway, they weren't in competition, and most importantly, Zhou Ze didn't have money to change shops.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze organized most of the textbooks and study guides in the bookstore and had the scrap collector take them away at the price of scrap paper.\n\nHe then went to the supermarket and bought ten small plastic chairs. Only two bookshelves remained, holding books Zhou Ze himself found rather interesting.\n\nAt present, rather than a bookstore, it was more like an elderly recreational activity center.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He wasn't very good at doing business. At the moment, he was just messing around without a clear plan; anyway, Xu Le had been constantly losing money when he was around, so Zhou Ze felt no pressure.\n\nGoing up to the small second floor, Zhou Ze turned on the freezer, set a temperature, smoked a cigarette outside while waiting a bit, then reached into the freezer and felt around.\n\nThe temperature was about right, so Zhou Ze lay inside.\n\nPurchased for over ten thousand, the freezer naturally had many functions, such as a timer design, which served as Zhou Ze's alarm clock.\n\nClosing the freezer,\n\nZhou Ze placed his hands on his lower abdomen, lying as straight as could be.\n\nHe looked as if,\n\nHe had passed away peacefully.\n\n............\n\nLate at night,\n\nA red car stopped on the roadside in front of the bookstore. The street was a bit empty, and only the adjacent noodle shop and bookstore still had their lights on.\n\nInside the car sat a well-dressed girl, wearing a black down jacket with shoulder-length hair. She looked somewhat cute and delicate.\n\n\"Xiao Bai, you jerk! I spent three days preparing, and today you tell me you've gone on a business trip? Go to hell, get lost!\"\n\nThe girl hung up the phone, sulking in the driver's seat.\n\nThe Corgi in the passenger seat jumped onto the girl's lap. Its fur was flowing and glossy, clearly indicating it was a good breed and very well cared for.\n\n\"Good boy, at least I have you with me.\"\n\nThe girl lit a cigarette, reached her hand out to flick the ash, and looked outside. She saw the bookstore, and crucially, through the glass window, she could see that the interior furnishings were somewhat unusual: there weren't many bookshelves, but instead, rows of plastic chairs.\n\nShe got out of the car, carrying her Corgi, and walked towards the bookstore. She didn't want to drive aimlessly by herself on this Valentine's Day night; she wanted to find a quiet place to sit.\n\nThe bookstore door wasn't closed. Upon entering, she could feel the warm air from the air conditioning.\n\nThe girl, with her dog, first casually picked a magazine from a bookshelf, then sat down on a plastic chair.\n\nThe Corgi was let loose by her, and the little fellow began \"exploring\" the shop.\n\nAfter flipping through a magazine, the girl gently stretched, feeling a bit thirsty. She called out:\n\n\"Boss, are you here? Do you have milk tea or coffee?\"\n\nThe girl stood up, put the magazine she had been holding back, and chose an illustrated version of *Honglou Meng* (Dream of the Red Chamber). By the time she sat down again, she couldn't help but call out once more:\n\n\"Boss, are you dead in the middle of the night? Is this how you run a shop?\"\n\nA small sign hung on the bookstore's glass door saying \"Open for business, welcome!\" The door was open, and the heating was on, so it definitely had to be still operating.\n\nIf the girl had been less polite or more curious at that moment and had proactively gone up to the second floor to take a look, she might have admired her own \"prophetic remark.\"\n\nIn the cramped space on the second floor, there was indeed an ice coffin,\n\nWith the boss lying inside, truly looking like a dead person.\n\nNo,\n\nThe boss was a dead person to begin with.\n\nOf course, the girl would likely have been scared out of her wits before she even had a chance to admire herself.\n\nA normal person entering a shop late at night and finding the owner lying in a frozen ice coffin – pretty horrifying, right?\n\nThe girl lit another cigarette, growing a bit impatient, and pulled out her phone to play.\n\nJust then, footsteps came from the stairwell. Zhou Ze hadn't woken up because he heard the girl's shouts; he had woken up naturally.\n\nAs soon as he came down the stairs, Zhou Ze saw a small yellow figure dart onto his leg, asking to be picked up.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and bent down, scooping the Corgi into his arms. The little fellow wasn't shy with strangers; it seemed familiar with everyone.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze notice the woman sitting in the shop.\n\nOh,\n\nHis first customer since opening.\n\nBut he wasn't as excited as he'd imagined, because today Zhou Ze had merely changed the bookstore's sign and tidied up the interior furnishings.\n\nYet, he still hadn't figured out,\n\nHow to make money next.\n\n\"Do you have coffee here, boss?\"\n\nThe girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a water dispenser in the corner of the wall; there were still disposable paper cups in it.\n\nThe girl felt a bit helpless but still stood up, poured herself a cup of water, and then returned to her plastic chair.\n\nHost and guest,\n\nLooked at each other in silence.\n\nAfter about half an hour of silence, the girl started browsing Weibo<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a> and watching videos. One video was very noisy and boisterous:\n\n\"Walk on by, pass on by, don't miss out!\n\nHell money consecrated by yours truly, the old Daoist, limited supply!\n\nYou can burn it now and take it out to use when you go down there in the afterlife, and even earn some interest, higher interest than Yu'e Bao<a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"ref2\">2</a>!\n\nYou can also burn it to send to your relatives in the afterlife—quick and convenient, honest dealings with everyone, no disturbance from ghost envoys, and no one skimming off the top!\"\n\nThe girl laughed after watching the video. People usually habitually want to share funny things they encounter. She looked up at the boss sitting behind the counter and said:\n\n\"Boss, have you seen this video? This old Daoist's live streams are quite famous. He's almost become an internet celebrity.\"\n\n\"Oh, live streams?\" Zhou Ze was a bit puzzled. He took out his phone. Xu Le's phone indeed had quite a few live streaming apps; it seemed this guy was truly bored in his daily life, either watching live streams or writing the sequel to *Bai Jie*<a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"ref3\">3</a>.\n\n\"Yeah, search for his ID, it's hilarious. He seems to have opened an afterlife supplies shop in Chengdu, but he hasn't live streamed for a long time.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened the app and searched for the old Daoist's ID as the girl suggested. He found a live stream room: \"Streamer Not Home.\"\n\nLuckily, he could watch replay videos. Zhou Ze casually clicked on a video from a month ago to play.\n\nIn the video, the old Daoist had fixed his phone in one position and was practicing martial arts by himself. His punches were skillful, clearly showing he was a trained practitioner. In the video frame, a young man sat there, a smile on his lips, squinting his eyes, as if watching a monkey show.\n\nZhou Ze perfunctorily fast-forwarded the video. Another man appeared in the frame, sitting behind the counter, holding a spoon, seemingly eating porridge.\n\nHe was frowning, he was in torment, he was in pain, he was resisting,\n\nA mouthful of porridge,\n\nHe was eating with great difficulty,\n\nThen continued with the second mouthful,\n\nAs if he were being tortured.\n\nZhou Ze watched, then took a deep breath, seemingly affected by the man in the corner of the video himself.\n\nEating,\n\nIt really isn't an easy thing.\n\nHe didn't know the identity of the man in the video, but he was instinctively a little interested. Was the other party an anorexia patient? Or did he have some gastrointestinal illness?\n\nAfter the video finished playing, Zhou Ze opened the page. On a whim, he directly used the account Xu Le was logged into to send a private message to the old Daoist:\n\n\"Who is that man in the video sitting in the background drinking porridge?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm leaving. How much?\" The girl stood up and stretched. \"If I tell people today, they'll definitely think I'm crazy. On Valentine's night, I actually sat in a bookstore and read *Honglou Meng* for so long.\"\n\n\"You can pay whatever you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe customer had only read for a while and poured herself a cup of purified water.\n\nThe girl glanced at Zhou Ze. \"Boss, your tactic is really good, just like those masters who interpret fortune sticks in temples.\n\nThey have a sign by the prayer mat that says 'Free Fortune Stick Interpretation,' but after tourists throw their sticks and have them interpreted, he'll then pull out a red donation ledger for you, filled with a long list of names and their donations, with the lowest being a hundred.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, noncommittally.\n\nThe girl took out a hundred-yuan bill, placed it on the chair she had been sitting on, then, carrying her Corgi, pushed open the bookstore door and left.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, picked up the hundred-yuan bill, and flicked it in his hand.\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nOne of the most beautiful sounds in the world.\n\nWhen he walked back to the counter, Zhou Ze noticed his phone screen light up. He opened his phone and found a reply, a private message from the old Daoist. The content of the reply was very simple:\n\n\"Gone!\"\n***\n<p id=\"fn1\"><sup>1</sup> Weibo: A Chinese microblogging website, similar to Twitter.</p>\n<p id=\"fn2\" id=\"ref2\"><sup>2</sup> Yu'e Bao: A popular Chinese money market fund from Ant Group (Alipay).</p>\n<p id=\"fn3\" id=\"ref3\"><sup>3</sup> *Bai Jie*: Refers to a notorious Chinese erotic novel.</p>",

    "content": "On this particular evening, there was only one customer, and the total income was one hundred yuan, but the cost was merely a cup of water.\n\nOf course, one could argue about other costs like electricity and rent...\n\nBut things shouldn't be calculated that way. When Xu Le was here before, these were also costs, but his income was almost negligible. One always needs to find suitable comparison subjects to gain a bit of satisfaction and confidence in life.\n\nAlso, it was because of that girl with the Corgi that Zhou Ze realized today was Valentine's Day.\n\nFlipping through WeChat, he found Dr. Lin's WeChat ID, tapped it, and Zhou Ze wanted to send a red packet. He tried to send 1314 yuan but realized he didn't have enough money. 131.4 yuan was enough, but sending that amount felt a bit petty.\n\nAnyway, she wasn't sleeping with him.\n\nForget it.\n\nHe put down his phone, picked up a random book, and started flipping through it, staying in that position until morning.\n\nHe went next door to eat wontons. Zhou Ze wasn't sure if the wrappers were thin or the filling thick. He ate them the same way as before: a large bowl of plum juice went down, followed by a quick gobbling of the wontons, then clutching his throat and taking deep breaths to suppress the urge to vomit.\n\nThinking that every meal in the future would have to follow this routine, Zhou Ze felt his future days seemed to be cast under a shadow.\n\nZhou Ze thought again of the man in the video who also painfully drank porridge. He felt a bit melancholic. Eating was originally one of the greatest enjoyments of human life, but now, it was completely cut off from them.\n\nHe wondered if there was an \"anorexic\" club in the world, where everyone would sit around a table at gatherings, and whoever could eat a mouthful of rice first would be met with everyone giving a thumbs-up:\n\n\"Oh, you're so great!*\nMy XXX is amazing!\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, the image sent shivers down his spine.\n\nRegardless, yesterday's video, including the old Daoist and the man drinking porridge, felt too distant for Zhou Ze for the time being.\n\nAfter Valentine's Day came Lunar New Year's Eve, or *Nian Sanshi*. In usual times, this commercial center would surely be decorated with lanterns and streamers, full of \"New Year's spirit,\" but in reality, it remained as cold and deserted as ever.\n\nThis was like life:\n\nSince there had been glory, there would naturally be decline.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when this commercial center first opened, it was unrivaled in popularity for a time. Now, it was completely deserted.\n\nXu Qinglang's business was good today, likely because many other shops were closed. As someone who still insisted on doing takeout on New Year's Eve, he naturally received more orders, as customers had fewer choices.\n\nFrom time to time, takeout delivery riders in blue, yellow, or red uniforms went in and out of his noodle shop. Zhou Ze squatted at the entrance of his bookstore, smoking a cigarette and sighing with emotion.\n\nDog-damned Xu Le, it would've been so much better if he'd opened a Braised Chicken and Rice shop back then.\n\nImmortals in myths often say, \"One day in heaven is a year on Earth.\"\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze felt this must be true, and it applied to hell as well.\n\nHe remembered when he died in a car accident... no, he remembered when he was sent into the incinerator, it should have been just Children's Day, but now, in a blink of an eye, it was New Year's Eve.\n\nMore than half a year had passed so quickly. A fleeting dream of life was merely stumbling blindly halfway down the road to the underworld.\n\nAfter many cigarettes and much contemplation, Zhou Ze felt tired. He took out his phone, wanting to see if there were any recent movies. The cinema was right next door, so he could go there to pass the time.\n\n\"Hey, do you have any newspapers at your place?\" Xu Qinglang asked, walking out after finishing a round of deliveries and seeing off the last delivery riders.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To paste on the walls,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"That economical?\"\n\n\"Newspapers on the walls create a sense of atmosphere and nostalgia. You didn't sell them all yesterday, did you?\"\n\n\"Still some left. Wait, I'll go find them for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze returned to the shop, carried a stack of newspapers half his height from a box near his fridge on the second floor, and brought them downstairs to Xu Qinglang, who was waiting.\n\n\"You're not going home for New Year's either?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Spending New Year's with books.\"\n\nIt was a pity Zhou Ze didn't have a goatee, nor wine in hand,\nOtherwise, he could have truly raised a toast to such a swaggering remark.\n\n\"Aren't you also not going home?\" Zhou Ze asked after a moment of self-indulgence.\n\n\"With over twenty apartments, which home should I go back to?\" Xu Qinglang sighed.\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two fell silent for a moment, then Zhou Ze spoke, \"Let me tell you a story.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Xu Qinglang nodded, a hint of shyness in his expression. His hair was a little long, a few strands hanging low, touching the corner of his mouth. He reached out to brush them away, his posture gentle, truly delicate and charming.\n\nThis kind of charm was not for outsiders to know.\n\n\"Once, also on New Year's Day, late at night on the road, someone encountered the richest man in the area.\n\nThe rich man was dead drunk.\n\nThat person asked the rich man, 'Why aren't you going home?'\n\nThe rich man replied: 'Home? Where is my home? My family and relatives are not by my side. The home you speak of, is it my largest estate in the city?'\"\n\nXu Qinglang listened to the story, nodding slightly, seemingly deeply sympathetic.\n\n\"Then that person pinned the rich man to the ground and beat him violently, shouting:\n\n'Serves you right for coming out on New Year's to show off and flaunt!'\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to finish the story.\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nTheir conversation ended.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore. The heating was on, making the shop warm and cozy. He flipped through his phone, having no one to contact.\n\nHe had thought of visiting the orphanage, but then decided against it. He didn't have much money left.\n\nBut just then, a customer arrived. It was a young man in blue work clothes and a hard hat. He pushed open the bookstore door and walked in, asking timidly, \"Can I read books here? How much is it?\" He pursed his lips.\n\n\"Just read. Pay what you think it's worth,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, gesturing for him to make himself at home.\n\n\"That's great then! Do you have novels here?\" the young man said somewhat stiffly, \"I like reading novels, the online kind.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a box behind the bookshelf, \"They're all in there.\"\n\nThe man walked to the box, rummaged through it a few times, and looked very happy, though some books still had their original wrappers on.\n\n\"Tear them open and read them. No charge,\" Zhou Ze said generously.\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nThe young man unwrapped an online novel, then sat down on a plastic stool and started reading.\n\nZhou Ze, as the owner, sat behind the counter trimming his nails. The young man read. About half an hour later, the young man stood up from his chair, took out his cigarettes, and offered one to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Not great cigarettes, don't mind them.\"\n\n\"Heh, cigarettes aren't good things to begin with, why divide them into good or bad?\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette. The other man also took one, then voluntarily walked outside the shop door, lighting and smoking it while braving the cold wind.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze, who had originally planned to smoke inside, pause for a moment. He thought better of it, put the cigarette aside, and continued trimming his nails.\n\nAfter the young man finished his cigarette outside, he came back in. This time, he didn't continue sitting on the plastic stool, but leaned against the wall and sat on the floor.\n\nThough the air conditioning was on inside, the floor tiles were still very cold. The young man, however, didn't seem to mind, suggesting he was used to it in his daily life.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, four more men in freshly laundered blue work clothes walked in from outside the shop. The oldest was no more than thirty, and the youngest was probably around seventeen.\n\nThese four entered together. The young man leaning against the wall waved to them; he must have called them over.\n\nThe newcomers greeted Zhou Ze, who replied perfunctorily, still trimming his nails.\n\nZhou Ze decided to buy a professional nail care kit; it was what his nails deserved.\n\nBut express delivery services were currently suspended, and most physical stores outside were closed, so he could only put it off for now.\n\nWhen he looked up again, Zhou Ze found that all five workers were sitting on the floor, each holding a novel and reading.\n\nBy their covers, they were all online novels, mostly fantasy. One was holding a horror novel, biting his nails as he read, clearly engrossed.\n\nHowever, the nail-biting habit was something Zhou Ze couldn't agree with.\n\nOne who knows how to care for their nails knows how to care for life, after all.\n\nFrom time to time, someone would laugh while reading a novel—a genuine laugh from the heart, inspired by the story.\n\nThe bookstore was quite full, but very quiet, with only occasional soft sounds that didn't disturb anyone.\n\nIn the evening, Xu Qinglang walked in with a bowl of dumplings. Upon entering, he immediately said:\n\n\"Oh, the shop's quite lively.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Hey guys, want something to eat?\" Xu Qinglang asked the workers sitting in the shop.\n\nThey exchanged glances, looking a little at a loss.\n\n\"Never mind, my treat.\" Xu Qinglang, after all, was a man with over twenty apartments. \"It's New Year's. It's not easy for you guys to be away from home. We're all out here making a living, people from all corners of the earth are brothers.\"\n\n\"Then, thank you, Boss. May you make a fortune,\" the oldest worker stood up and thanked Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"You're welcome, you're welcome.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put down Zhou Ze's dumplings and went back to his own shop.\n\nZhou Ze drank a little soup, then forced down two dumplings. Annoying Xu Qinglang had forgotten to bring him plum juice, and he couldn't eat without it.\n\nHe took out the cigarettes from the counter and walked out from behind it.\n\n\"When you finish reading, just swap them out. I should have the full sets here. Anyway, my shop here is a losing business, so don't be polite with me, everyone.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed out cigarettes one by one.\n\nThe workers were all flattered and overwhelmed as they accepted them.\n\nThen they all stood up, walked outside the shop door, squatted in a row, and smoked.\n\nThey didn't want to dirty the shop's environment.\n\nZhou Ze thought for a moment, then also walked out of the shop. Outside, the wind was a bit cold. He also squatted down beside them and smoked along.\n\nThe workers chatted:\n\nThose who were married talked about their wives and children;\n\nThose who weren't married talked about their sweethearts they knew in Tongcheng or back home,\n\nTeasing each other,\n\nJoking with each other,\n\nEven though they all knew each other inside out,\n\nThey still had plenty to talk about.\n\nJudging by their accents, these workers came from all corners of the earth, not from the same village.\n\nTongcheng was close to Shanghai, part of the Yangtze River Delta region. Although its scale couldn't compare to Shanghai's, the demand for labor here each year was immense. As long as one was willing to work hard and endure hardship, there was no shortage of jobs or money to be made.\n\nThey passed cigarettes around two more times.\n\nZhou Ze spoke, \"Guys, are you really not going home to see your families for New Year's?\"\n\n\"No, our families are all well.\"\n\n\"It's a hassle to travel back and forth. There's still work in the first month of the year, and the boss will give red packets too. Might as well take them and send more money back home.\"\n\n\"Haha, today's been great. We have novels to read, cigarettes to smoke. This New Year's has some flavor to it.\"\n\n\"Boss, when are you closing?\" one worker asked.\n\n\"Not closing,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Boss isn't going home?\"\n\n\"My wife's disobedient at home, so I'm not going back.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a surge of heroic pride!\n\nAll the workers gave Zhou Ze a thumbs-up and cheered for him.\n\nOf course, no one elaborated too much. From their accents, they could tell, and since Zhou Ze ran a bookstore, not a fruit stand, the workers guessed Zhou Ze was a local.\n\nFor a local to stay and mind his shop instead of going home for New Year's also had its reasons, so everyone didn't continue to tease or joke about it.\n\nMoreover, each of them was the pillar of their family. They came out to work and earn money, while their wives managed the elderly and children at home. They were tired and hardworking, but their wives were the same.\n\nLife was something to be struggled through and endured generation after generation. Whose life was easy?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to offer more cigarettes, a shout came from afar:\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and stood up. He then noticed a familiar car, a Porsche Cayenne, parked across the road.\n\nYes, his wife's car.\n\nThe one who shouted was his sister-in-law. She had indeed been terrified by Zhou Ze in the bathroom a while ago, but she had since returned to normal. She couldn't possibly believe her brother-in-law was a ghost, so she just attributed it to her eyes playing tricks on her back then.\n\nOf course, she couldn't have a very good temper towards Zhou Ze, as he had actually scared her, a young lady, into wetting herself. How embarrassing!\n\n\"Xu Le, come home for dinner!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law shouted.\n\n\"Not going back. The shop's busy and lively,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nA joke,\n\nTo go back on New Year's and face those awful in-laws?\n\nTo endure the temper of this immature sister-in-law?\n\nMost importantly,\n\nTo rush home eagerly on New Year's only to sleep in separate beds?\n\nWas he looking for torment?\n\n\"Sis, is this guy crazy?! He's unreasonable, inexplicable, and stubborn as a mule!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law pouted in the back seat.\n\nDr. Lin smiled, \"Let's go home and have dinner with Mom and Dad first.\"\n\n\"Oh, hearing that, Sis, are you planning to come out tonight?\"\n\n\"I am his legal wife, after all.\" Dr. Lin said no more, started the car, and drove away.\n\nWatching the car drive off,\n\nZhou Ze shouted to the workers beside him, \"Guys, isn't my wife beautiful?\"\n\n\"Beautiful!\"\n\n\"Lucky man!\"\n\n\"Absolutely gorgeous!\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha.\"\n\nXu Qinglang came out of his shop with a large tray.\n\n\"Here, braised pork rice. Guys, dig in!\"\n\nThe workers seemed a bit reserved and awkward. The oldest worker said somewhat sheepishly, \"We came out without...\"\n\n\"I said before, I'm treating you brothers to a meal! If you mention money again, you're not treating me like a brother. Who knows, we might meet again somewhere far off, and there might be a time when I need your help.\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\n\"Deal!\"\n\n\"When you come to my hometown...\"\n\n\"I'll be there!\"\n\nThe workers all carried a large bowl of braised pork rice into the bookstore. They squatted on the floor, placing their bowls on the plastic stools, and started eating heartily.\n\nOne worker was eating while still reading a novel, and another worker next to him tapped his head with his chopsticks.\n\n\"You lard-brained fool! If you accidentally stain the book, how will the boss sell it?\"\n\n\"You're right, let's eat first.\"\n\nThe atmosphere was lively. Zhou Ze returned to his counter. He ate three more of the already somewhat cold dumplings. This time, he didn't know why, perhaps because of the atmosphere, but his nausea was much less than before.\n\nAfter the meal,\n\nEveryone continued reading.\n\nInside the room, there was heating and novels to read, making for a very harmonious scene.\n\nUnconsciously, it was ten o'clock at night.\n\nThe oldest worker stood up, stretched, and said, \"Guys, it's time. Let's head back. Let's help the boss clean up the place.\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nThe five workers helped Zhou Ze clean the shop from top to bottom.\n\n\"Boss, we're leaving. Thank you for today.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nThey left,\n\nUnlike the girl with the Corgi from last night, who left a hundred yuan after reading for a while, these men read for a whole day and half a night, and didn't leave a single yuan.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't mind at all, nor did he feel any dissatisfaction.\n\nHe stretched and decided to go call Xu Qinglang to collect the bowls and chopsticks from the shop. As he walked into the noodle shop, Zhou Ze saw Xu Qinglang sitting behind a table, reading a newspaper.\n\nYes, it was the newspaper Zhou Ze had given him earlier in the day.\n\nXu Qinglang wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, and indeed had a scholarly air about him. Truly worthy of being a man with over twenty apartments,\n\nHe exuded an aura, no matter how you looked at him!\n\n\"The bowls and chopsticks over there, can you clean them up?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright, I'll go now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put down his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and got up to clean up the bowls and chopsticks next door.\n\nOn top of the large stack of newspapers was a copy of the Yangzi Evening News. Looking at the date, it was seven days old;\n\nThe front page of the newspaper featured a bold, thick headline:\n\n\"Residential Building Fire, Heroic Deeds Touch Hearts\"\n\nLast week, a densely populated residential community in Tongcheng suffered a sudden, serious fire.\n\nFive young construction workers from a nearby construction site, disregarding the danger, rushed in to save people. They rescued over twenty elderly people, women, and children in total, but after their last charge into the burning building to save lives,\n\nThey never came out again.\n\nThe cover of the Yangzi Evening News had a large photograph,\n\nIt was a group photo of these five men,\n\nThey stood shoulder to shoulder, posing with an old-fashioned peace sign, seemingly a photo taken when they first arrived at the construction site and lived in the same temporary dorm,\n\nTheir young faces, yet tinged with a bit of the weariness of life,\n\nIn the photo,\n\nThey smiled somewhat reservedly, but also very brightly.\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the bookstore,\n\nLooking at the five bowls of braised pork rice on the plastic stools in front of him,\n\nNot a single bite had been taken, and the food had long since gone cold.\n\nIn each bowl, a pair of chopsticks stood upright, stuck directly into the rice.**\n\n\"Brothers,\n\nEat well,\n\nDrink well.\"\n\nXu Qinglang murmured.\n\nOutside,\n\nFirecrackers began to crackle,\n\nTongcheng had no firework ban. For a time, colorful lights filled the sky, making for a very lively and festive scene.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, gazing outside,\n\nAnd softly said:\n\n\"It's New Year's.\"\n\n---\n*   \"你含棒棒哦！我家XXX好厉害哦！\" (nǐ hán bàngbàng ó! wǒ jiā XXX hǎo lìhài ó!) - A contemporary internet meme in China, often used sarcastically to praise someone (or their child) for a very mundane or obvious achievement, implying a slight overestimation of their greatness or a superficial kind of praise. The literal meaning of \"含棒棒\" is \"holding a stick\" or \"sucking on a lollipop/stick,\" but in context of the meme, it conveys a sense of being \"great\" or \"impressive\" in a mildly mocking way.",

    "content": "The sound of firecrackers bade farewell to the old year. After midnight, the sounds of fireworks and firecrackers came from all directions, exceptionally lively and extraordinarily dense. What was originally sparse activity now took on an overwhelming momentum.\n\nZhou Ze blew on his fingernails. The commotion outside had little to do with him. He had no home, and although nominally, he now had a \"home,\" he didn't want to go back.\n\nMany people, while alive, had once entertained the thought that if they could be reborn and return, they would do this and that.\n\nStirring words, gesturing spiritedly, treating ten thousand households of lords as dirt.¹\n\nBut when you truly return from hell, you suddenly realize that your past pursuits, ideas, and aspirations are just like when the kindergarten teacher asks: \"What do you little ones want to be when you grow up?\"\n\nAnd then the little ones all reply: \"Scientists, doctors, astronauts, soldiers...\"\n\nDreams are always plump.²\n\nAs for reality, it's not exactly bony, but a person's \"chicken blood\"³ is destined to be limited.\n\nSometimes, being able to breathe, to hear sounds, to sit here and \"grind foreign work,\"⁴ squandering some time,\n\nPerhaps this is what truly means quiet years and good times.\n\nXu Qinglang was still sleeping at the shop tonight. Zhou Ze heard him close the shop door.\n\nHe said he had over twenty apartments, but Zhou Ze knew clearly that his parents were right there in the shop.\n\nA family should be all together.\n\nCelebrating New Year this year was naturally even more important.\n\nOutside, it started to rain. Bits of dampness began to seep in, making one feel a bit oppressed.\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang. It was his own missus's call.\n\n\"Hello.\" Zhou Ze answered the phone.\n\n\"Asleep?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\nZhou Ze thought the question was very idiotic.\n\nIf I were asleep, who would answer your call?\n\nCould it be a dead person... oh no, a \"dead ghost\"?⁵\n\nNo, something seemed wrong.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back slightly in his chair, his mind conjuring Doctor Lin gently poking his chest with her finger, calling him: \"You dead ghost...\"\n\nFor the first time, truthfully, he felt why it could be so captivating.\n\nPerhaps he was too bored, or purely idle,\n\nZhou Ze found his thoughts now wandering,\n\nThinking a bit too much.\n\n\"Not yet.\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nDoctor Lin pushed open the shop door and walked in. She was holding a red umbrella, wearing leather pants on her lower body, a white sweater on her upper body, and her hair was spread over her shoulders.\n\nZhou Ze momentarily forgot to put down the phone.\n\nThis woman,\n\nWas indeed very beautiful.\n\nEspecially her temperament; it always gives you a feeling of \"if life was just like the first meeting.\"⁶ In an instant, piercing a man's heart.\n\n\"Afraid I'd be lonely and desolate by myself?\" Zhou Ze stood up and poured Doctor Lin a glass of water.\n\nShe was the mistress of this place.\n\nHmm,\n\nTo be precise, the money Xu Le used to open this bookstore still came from her family.\n\nDoctor Lin took the water, shook her head, and said nothing.\n\nThe two were husband and wife, but in reality, they were like the most familiar strangers, in a more awkward position than \"blue-faced confidants.\"⁷\n\nTo go a step further, difficult;\n\nTo take a step back, even more difficult.\n\n\"Let's go for a walk.\" Zhou Ze felt the room was a bit stuffy, and it was impossible for him to invite Doctor Lin to his sleeping place on the second floor.\n\nEven if Doctor Lin had \"taken the wrong medicine\" today and intended to \"feed herself to the tiger,\"⁸ seeing the freezer on his second floor, she would probably immediately dial the number of a familiar psychiatric hospital and have him sent in for a good reform.\n\n\"It's raining.\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Just a light rain, it's fine.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, relaxed and at ease.\n\n...\n\n\"Hualala...\"⁹\n\nThe rain got heavier, and it was very heavy.\n\nZhou Ze, who hadn't even brought an umbrella, thinking of experiencing \"spring rain as precious as oil,\"¹⁰ was almost drenched like a \"drowned chicken.\"¹¹ Doctor Lin was still holding her umbrella, standing nearby, and Zhou Ze refused her suggestion to share an umbrella.\n\nThe \"pretence\"¹² he put on, he had to see through, even with tears.\n\nPatting his soaking wet hair, Zhou Ze shivered. He wasn't very afraid of the cold; he was actually very resistant to cold. It was just that the woman beside him, even though she hadn't gotten very wet while holding her umbrella, was still slightly trembling.\n\nThe bus stop shelter could block most of the rain,\n\nBut the cold wind that night could still rage unrestrained.\n\nPetty bourgeois ambiance,¹³\n\nA man and a woman together,\n\nGetting wet on a rainy night,\n\nThe beautiful woman evoking pity,\n\nThis should have been a good opportunity, a good moment, for both to foster feelings. Even an \"accidental discharge,\"¹⁴ plus a \"mistake made in the flower field,\"¹⁵ ending in \"the last shot hitting the target\"¹⁶ were all possible, but the two remained silent.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, and Doctor Lin stood beside him.\n\nOne wanted to escape, the other was inherently resistant; naturally, they couldn't connect.\n\nA forcibly twisted melon; both the melon and the vine are awkward.¹⁷\n\nZhou Ze harbored some resentment towards Xu Le in his heart. If that coward had \"acted like an overlord forcing himself upon her\"¹⁸ after marriage, there wouldn't be all this mess now. Even if Doctor Lin were already a married woman or had a child, she would probably still be incomparably beautiful, even adding some points.\n\nHe himself could then \"push the boat along with the current.\" Why would he need to be in such a dilemma now?\n\nOf course, such resentment was quite unfair to Xu Le. If Zhou Ze himself had \"acted like an overlord forcing himself upon her\" that night, would Doctor Lin desperately resist and shout \"Indecency!\"? And then call the police to send Zhou Ze to the Public Security Bureau? Accuse him of rape?\n\nThe rain was still falling.\n\nZhou Ze tossed his cigarette butt onto the ground.\n\n\"Did you drive here?\"\n\n\"Took a taxi.\" Doctor Lin replied.\n\n\"I'll take you back.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nNo need to dwell on how this seemingly silly and naive New Year's Eve rainy night walk on the road began;\n\nAt least, the two of them felt that ending it at this moment was most suitable.\n\nThey hailed a ride-hailing car, and Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin sat inside together.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, they arrived. Zhou Ze got out of the car with Doctor Lin. The driver settled the fare and drove away directly.\n\nHome was just upstairs, but Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin did not choose to go up directly.\n\nThis scene was a bit like middle school sweethearts walking together to the girl's home downstairs at night. It was time to part ways, lingering affectionately, utterly devoted to each other.¹⁹\n\nBut the atmosphere at this moment was not as intense as that of green middle schoolers. It was like meat soup without salt and MSG; tasteless to eat, but a shame to throw away.\n\n\"Aren't you coming up?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"No, I'm not. Let's talk about it after a while. Our business can be dealt with then.\"\n\nDoctor Lin understood Zhou Ze's unspoken meaning and said, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, then reached out. He had originally intended to pat Doctor Lin's shoulder, but after putting his hand there, he suddenly felt an impulse and still pulled her into an embrace.\n\nDoctor Lin's body stiffened for a moment, but she didn't resist.\n\nThe two got a little closer, but it wasn't a very intimate gesture. Compared to the connection between their identities, it could already be said to be quite distant.\n\nShe smelled quite fragrant. He didn't know what kind of body wash she used when showering, but in short, it smelled very good.\n\n\"I've always been curious about one thing: Is there someone else in your heart?\" Zhou Ze added, \"That 'someone else' can refer to a man or a woman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Doctor Lin was very frank, even answering without hesitation.\n\nBefore, her husband had always been timid and shrinking, making her unable to bear it.\n\nNow, her husband seemed to have become a different person, which also allowed her to shed some burdens.\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze responded. He glanced slightly upwards, wanting to see if a certain specific \"protective color\"²⁰ had appeared on top of his head.\n\nHe was still a bit disappointed.\n\nCouldn't say it was love.\n\nCouldn't say he liked her much.\n\nEven familiarity was barely there.\n\nBut she, no matter what, was nominally his woman. As a result, he was still \"cuckolded.\"²¹\n\nHmm, as long as it's a man,\n\nNo,\n\nAs long as it's a male,\n\nOne wouldn't feel too happy about encountering such a thing, right?\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" This was the second time she said sorry.\n\nZhou Ze let go, and the two slowly separated.\n\n\"Saying sorry makes us strangers.\" Zhou Ze leaned against a nearby stone block and sat down. The rain had already subsided, and there was a small eaves here.\n\n\"I'll give you another sum of money, and you can go open another bookstore.\" After Doctor Lin finished speaking, she said again, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally wanted to generously wave his hand and say: \"I don't care for money.\"\n\nBut thinking about his freezer, thinking about his future life,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that he couldn't bring himself to say it.\n\nWhat if,\n\nWhat if,\n\nWhat if this woman took it seriously, thought giving money was an insult to him, and then really didn't give any monetary compensation?\n\n\"Let's talk in a few days.\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"How is that guy?\"\n\n\"He's very handsome, in my opinion.\" Doctor Lin replied.\n\nIt's a man.\n\nStab.\n\nAnother knife.\n\nIf it were a woman, it would be easier to accept...\n\nZhou Ze felt as if the intensity of \"photosynthesis\"²² on top of his head had grown stronger.\n\n\"No chance, right?\" Zhou Ze asked a very silly question. He regretted it as soon as he asked, but he still comforted himself, \"I'm asking this for the poor Xu Le.\"\n\nHaving occupied someone else's body, and now that person's wife has cheated, you should at least help ask why, right?\n\nHmm, that's how it is.\n\n\"No chance.\" Doctor Lin's answer was still quick and very certain.\n\nThis woman was also a surgeon, and her speaking style was really straightforward. Like holding a scalpel, every cut hitting a key spot, never wishy-washy.\n\nOtherwise, the patient would suffer more; in relationships, it seemed to be the same principle.\n\n\"Alright, alright, can't compare, can't compare, it's fine. Everyone lives their own life. You go back and deal with your parents properly.\" Zhou Ze was a bit annoyed.\n\nDoctor Lin nodded, turned, and walked into the stairwell.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, preparing to hail a taxi and leave. But at this moment, an unknown number called:\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Sir, I've driven the car back.\"\n\n\"So smart?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised. He recognized it as the voice of the previous driver.\n\n\"You left a bag on the back seat; I'm bringing it back to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, thanks.\"\n\nThat car drove back downstairs to the community, and from the car window, the driver handed out a woman's bag.\n\n\"You can check it.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony and opened Doctor Lin's bag. Inside were just a mobile phone, a wallet, a data charging cable, and a few packs of tissues.\n\nTaking out the wallet, Zhou Ze froze as soon as he opened it.\n\nHis gaze fixed on the photo slot in the wallet.\n\nThere was a photo there.\n\nThe woman in the photo looked very young, even a bit... immature, wearing an ill-fitting white coat.\n\nAs for the man to the girl's right, Zhou Ze had a sense of unfamiliar familiarity.\n\nHe was stunned for a while.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze recognize him.\n\n\"Isn't this me?\"\n\nThis was a cropped photo. It should have been a group photo, but it was specifically cropped into a photo of just the two of them.\n\n\"Is anything missing?\" The driver urged.\n\n\"It's fine, thank you, driver. You can go.\"\n\nThe driver drove away.\n\nZhou Ze continued holding the wallet and looking at it. He didn't even think that he should call Doctor Lin at this moment and tell her to come down for the bag.\n\nSome memories, not exactly forgotten but rather not given much thought, began to surface.\n\nHe vaguely remembered,\n\nFive or six years ago, he seemed to have mentored a batch of students who were still in school and assigned for internships. There was a girl, seemingly surnamed Lin, and her appearance seemed to overlap with the girl in the photo.\n\nA woman changes a lot as she grows up.²³\n\nA smile appeared at the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nDoctor Lin also had such an adorably naive time back then. Who knew that five or six years later she would grow into such a beautiful woman? He really hadn't noticed this girl's development potential at all.\n\nZhou Ze shook the wallet in his hand.\n\n\"Damn it, serves you right for being almost thirty and still single before.\"\n\nThis time, surprisingly, he wasn't cursing Xu Le,\n\nBut cursing himself,\n\n\"Eyes,\n\nReally blind...\"\n\nZhou Ze opened his arms and stretched.\n\nThe one who \"put a green hat\" on him,\n\nWas actually still himself.\n\nPost-rain early morning, the first day of the Lunar New Year.\n\nHehe,\n\nGazed at the sky.\n\nHe solemnly reached out and patted his own chest.\n\nZhou Ze paused.\n\nAnd said very seriously:\n\n\"Xu Le, you truly are my good brother!\n\nYour wife, I shall take care of her; you need not worry.\"²⁴\n\n---\n¹ This phrase, \"激昂文字，揮斥方遒，糞土當年萬戶侯,\" is a line from Mao Zedong's poem \"Qinyuanchun·Changsha.\" It depicts youthful passion, ambition, and a disdain for feudal power.\n² \"Dreams are always plump\" (夢想，總是豐滿的) is part of a common Chinese idiom \"理想很豐滿，現實很骨感\" (ideals are plump, reality is bony), meaning ideals are grand but reality is harsh or meager. Here, \"plump\" implies grand or full of promise.\n³ \"Chicken blood\" (雞血) refers to an outdated, pseudo-scientific Chinese medical practice of injecting chicken blood for invigoration. It is now used idiomatically to describe extreme enthusiasm, hype, or being overly pumped up.\n⁴ \"Grind foreign work\" (磨洋工) is an idiom meaning to dawdle, loaf on the job, or work slowly and inefficiently.\n⁵ \"Dead ghost\" (死鬼) is a colloquial, often playful or exasperated, term a wife might use for her husband, similar to \"rascal\" or \"dear old thing.\"\n⁶ \"If life was just like the first meeting\" (人生若只如初見) is a famous line from a classical Chinese poem by Nalan Xingde. It evokes a feeling of beautiful, fleeting first impressions or a longing for the purity and wonder of initial encounters.\n⁷ \"Blue-faced confidant\" (藍顏閨蜜) refers to a male confidant or best friend who is strictly platonic and not a romantic interest.\n⁸ \"Feed oneself to the tiger\" (以身飼虎) is an idiom meaning to sacrifice oneself, often to help others or to put oneself willingly into a dangerous situation. Here, it implies offering herself up to him.\n⁹ \"Hualala\" (嘩啦啦) is a Chinese onomatopoeic word for the sound of heavy rain or flowing water.\n¹⁰ \"Spring rain as precious as oil\" (春雨貴如油) is a Chinese idiom meaning that spring rain is extremely valuable for agriculture and growth.\n¹¹ \"Drowned chicken\" (落湯雞) is a Chinese idiom meaning to be completely drenched, like a chicken that has fallen into soup.\n¹² \"Pretence\" or \"showing off\" (裝逼, *zhuāngbī*) is a colloquial and somewhat vulgar slang term meaning to act pretentious, show off, or brag.\n¹³ \"Petty bourgeois ambiance\" (小資情調, *xiǎozī qíngdiào*) refers to a lifestyle or aesthetic that is refined, comfortable, and often slightly pretentious, associated with a certain middle-class aspiration for taste and leisure.\n¹⁴ \"Accidental discharge\" (擦槍走火, *cāqiāng zǒuhuǒ*) literally means \"to wipe a gun and it fires.\" It is used metaphorically to refer to an unintended sexual encounter or a situation spiraling out of control.\n¹⁵ \"Mistake made in a flower field\" (花田裡犯的錯, *huātiánlǐ fàn de cuò*) is a euphemism for a romantic or sexual liaison, derived from a popular song lyric.\n¹⁶ \"The last shot hitting the target\" (最後一炮中把, *zuìhòu yīpào zhòngbǎ*) is explicit slang for impregnating someone.\n¹⁷ This phrase, \"強扭的瓜，瓜和蔓，都彆扭,\" is a play on the common idiom \"強扭的瓜不甜\" (a melon twisted off the vine isn't sweet), which means that forced relationships or situations don't turn out well. The author extends the meaning to imply that both parties involved in a forced relationship would be awkward or uncomfortable.\n¹⁸ \"Overlord forcing his bow\" (霸王硬上弓, *bàwáng yìngshànggōng*) is an idiom that literally describes a historical figure (Hegemon-King Xiang Yu) forcing his powerful bow. It is used metaphorically to mean to force oneself upon someone, often with sexual connotations, or to aggressively impose one's will.\n¹⁹ \"Utterly devoted to each other\" (你儂我儂, *nǐ nóng wǒ nóng*) is an idiom describing two people deeply in love, inseparable and mutually devoted.\n²⁰ \"Protective color\" (保護色) literally means camouflage. Here, it is used humorously as a veiled reference to \"wearing a green hat\" (戴綠帽子, *dài lǜ màozi*), a Chinese idiom meaning to be cuckolded. Zhou Ze is wondering if his head is turning green from being cheated on.\n²¹ \"Cuckolded\" (被綠了, *bèi lǜ le*) is a slang term directly translated from \"being greened,\" referring to being cheated on by one's spouse or partner.\n²² \"Photosynthesis\" (光合作用, *guānghézuòyòng*) is used here humorously. Given the preceding reference to \"protective color\" (green), the joke is that his head is metaphorically turning greener, implying he is being cuckolded more intensely.\n²³ \"A woman changes a lot as she grows up\" (女大十八變, *nǚ dà shíbā biàn*) is a Chinese idiom meaning that a girl undergoes significant, often positive, changes in appearance as she grows older, typically becoming more beautiful.\n²⁴ \"Your wife, I shall take care of her; you need not worry\" (汝妻子吾自養之，汝勿慮也) is a famous, often ironic or humorous, quote from the Chinese classic *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*. It is attributed to Zhang Fei to his sworn brother Guan Yu (though historically, the line was exchanged between Cao Cao and Guan Yu). It implies taking over someone's wife, often after their death, but here used humorously and ironically by Zhou Ze, who has taken over Xu Le's body and now his marital situation.",

    "content": "The lingering smell of fireworks and firecrackers still hung in the air, a bit acrid, but it seemed this was the true scent of the New Year, or what’s commonly called the \"New Year's spirit.\"\n\nEspecially for Zhou Ze at this moment, life seemed to have gained a touch more beauty.\n\nIt wasn't a love of eternal vows, nor could it be exaggerated as \"mountains crumble, heaven and earth merge\"*.\n\nIt was simply akin to a child who usually had no pocket money finding a ten-yuan note on the street, with no passing police uncle nearby, but instead a convenience store very close by.\n\nHaving walked through hell and changed bodies, there were still many problems, discovered and undiscovered, that needed solving, and his own personality had subtly undergone significant changes.\n\nThinking back to his previous life, when he left the orphanage, all he wanted was to climb up step by step with his own hands and abilities. In fact, upon closer inspection, the reason he overlooked Doctor Lin back then probably wasn't how naive or ugly Doctor Lin was five years ago. That young woman, at the time, should have been feeling the stirrings of love, otherwise she wouldn't have cut out that photo and kept it in her wallet.\n\nWhat a pity. At that time, he had neither the energy nor the inclination to spare a glance at the scenery along the way. His obsession was too strong, appearing burdened by deep grievances, yet pretending to be so cool, so cool he was like a pure, uncorrupted force.\n\nUnlike now. He had died once and returned, and instead, there was a sense of carefree detachment and melancholy, like \"a man without office is free from care\"*.\n\nBut no matter what,\n\nthe feeling of being secretly loved, even the feeling of \"love until death\"*,\n\nwas indeed wonderful.\n\nHe made a call, and Doctor Lin came down again, somewhat hurriedly. He took his women's bag from Zhou Ze's hand and smiled, not saying thank you. Given their current relationship, \"thank you\" was even more inappropriate than \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nWaving goodbye,\n\nZhou Ze left with his back to him,\n\nto go back to sleep,\n\nand await tomorrow. Tomorrow would be even better.\n\nDoctor Lin felt that her husband's mood seemed to have shifted slightly, like a sense of relief.\n\nPerhaps, if both sides could come to terms with it, it would indeed be a good thing.\n\nRather than awkwardly remaining entangled, it was better to separate freely and face life anew, each on their own.\n\nOne could only say that life was full of impermanence. Doctor Lin could never have imagined that another soul inhabited her husband's body at this moment.\n\nIt was the man she, as an intern, had vaguely adored.\n\nZhou Ze called another car, then squatted at the entrance of the residential complex, smoking. His phone screen kept showing messages of him searching. Zhou Ze regretted letting that driver go; he should have asked him to wait so he could take his car back to the bookstore.\n\nNow, look at this,\n\non New Year's Eve night,\n\ncars were really hard to get.\n\nAfter waiting for about ten minutes, and smoking three cigarettes, Zhou Ze grew annoyed. He stood up straight and stretched.\n\nAlthough he wasn't particularly afraid of the cold, walking back like this would be quite tiring.\n\nJust then, a black sedan drove towards him from the road ahead. As it passed Zhou Ze, it slowed down.\n\n\"Need a ride?\" The driver poked his head out the window. He had a big round face, was middle-aged, unshaven, and wore a black padded jacket.\n\n\"Yes.\" Zhou Ze had no other choice.\n\n\"Get in. Won't charge you extra.\" The driver smiled.\n\nZhou Ze got in the car, stated the bookstore's location, and settled on a price. The driver started the car again.\n\nThe car must have been new; the seat cushions still gave off a plastic and leather smell, and the interior was very clean.\n\nGenerally, few people would be willing to use a new car for ride-sharing.\n\n\"That place is remote,\" the driver said, offering Zhou Ze a cigarette. Zhou Ze took it.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Do you live there?\"\n\n\"My shop is there.\"\n\n\"Oh, business must be tough then?\" That commercial center had long been dead, with no foot traffic, and many people knew that.\n\n\"You're not from around here?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe local dialect of Tongcheng was different from other regional dialects; it was almost like a different language compared to Mandarin, making it easy to distinguish.\n\n\"I'm from Rongcheng; I work here.\" The driver lit his cigarette. \"Smoke, don't be shy.\"\n\nZhou Ze also lit his cigarette and took a puff, frowning slightly. The smoke tasted unusually faint.\n\n\"Not going back for New Year's?\"\n\n\"Wife and kids are home, no problem. I'm not going back; I'm trying to earn a bit more money.\" The driver stuck his hand out the window and flicked the ash. \"I have four children.\"\n\n\"That's impressive,\" Zhou Ze praised.\n\n\"It's hard too, though.\" The driver smacked his lips. \"My wife's first child was a son, the second was also a boy, so I wanted a daughter. Then the third was another boy. Thankfully, the fourth was finally a girl. I'm satisfied now.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Zhou Ze agreed, taking another puff, then tossing the cigarette out the window. The smoke was so faint, it was like smoking a paper roll.\n\n\"I'm not old-fashioned, and I don't favor boys over girls. I just like children and wanted to have more, haha.\" When talking about his children, the driver became more talkative.\n\n\"The fine for the youngest one hasn't been paid yet. When it's time for school, I'll go pay the money and get the household registration settled. Oh, right, what kind of shop do you run?\"\n\n\"A bookstore.\"\n\n\"How's business?\" The driver was really bringing up a sore subject*.\n\n\"Not great.\"\n\n\"Right, these days you can buy books online too, and with coupons.\"\n\nUp ahead, there was a car accident. Traffic police had set up roadblocks, turning the original four-lane road into a single lane. Fortunately, there weren't many cars on the road late on New Year's Eve, so it shouldn't cause too much delay.\n\n\"For cars to crash on New Year's, that's pretty unlucky.\" The driver exhaled a smoke ring. His tone of voice was rather like a leader's, carrying a hint of criticism.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back, adopting a more comfortable posture, and asked:\n\n\"Is this car new?\"\n\n\"Yes, my son gave it to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"How old are you? And how old is your son?\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The driver squinted his eyes. \"My son is ambitious. These days, ambition isn't tied to age*. As long as you have hands, feet, and a brain, and your fate isn't always against you*, how can you be poor?\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Zhou Ze nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Beep beep... Beep beep...\"\n\nA car behind them seemed to be in a hurry to get home, honking its horn frequently, urging the cars ahead to move faster.\n\n\"Honk, honk, honk, honk all the way to hell.\"\n\nThe driver, getting a bit carried away when provoked*, leaned out of the car again and cursed at the car behind them.\n\nBut the cars behind them honked even more frequently, as if deliberately showing defiance.\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nThe driver made to push open his door, ready to get out and have a proper argument.\n\nJust then, the traffic police directing traffic ahead gestured for their lane to move quickly. Only then did the driver sheepishly sit back, start the car, and drive past.\n\n\"Business is tough today, oh.\" The driver started to lament again. \"Should've just gone home to see my wife and kids.\"\n\n\"It's alright,\" Zhou Ze said noncommittally. He'd seen that the noodle shop next door was doing decent business. Most competitors were closed for the New Year, and even if demand was a bit lower during this period, overall business was still better than before.\n\nEspecially just now, Zhou Ze had tried to hail a taxi for so long and no one had accepted his order.\n\n\"Heh, it's not easy, no.\" The driver still shook his head. \"I don't dare rest. Tuition for the kids, I have to send money home every month. During the day, I work, then come out to drive for half the night. This life, it's pretty dull. Even for cigarettes, I can't bear to smoke a better brand.\"\n\nYour cigarette... it seems to be fake.\n\nZhou Ze took out his own cigarette, pulled one out, and fiddled with it in his hand.\n\n\"But it's fine. The internet is convenient now. Having a video call with my wife and kids before sleeping at home at night is pretty good; I get to see them.\" A relaxed expression appeared on the driver's face.\n\nZhou Ze slightly closed his eyes. He wasn't asleep, but at that moment, he didn't feel like talking or chatting.\n\nBut even without Zhou Ze's feedback or reaction, the driver continued to talk. It was New Year's, and he was alone, a stranger in a strange land, naturally lonely.\n\nFrom naming his children, to their schools, to his parents, to the customs of his village, the driver rambled on.\n\nIn the end, Zhou Ze simply rested his forehead against the car window and urged, \"Master, drive faster.\"\n\nThis driver was driving too slowly, perhaps only thirty miles per hour.\n\nAnd this was an elevated road.\n\nZhou Ze even wondered if the other party was too lonely, which was why he deliberately drove slowly to find someone to chat with. But Zhou Ze had no interest in being a sympathetic listener.\n\n\"Heh heh, it's a new car, and I'm not too familiar with it yet, so I don't dare drive too fast.\" The driver lovingly stroked the steering wheel. \"This car isn't worth much, it's even very cheap, but it's my eldest son's heartfelt gift. I have to cherish and treasure it.\n\nI'll try to use this car to run a few years of business, and when my eldest son finds a partner, I'll get him a house. One down, one to go. I also don't want the older ones to have to raise the younger ones; that's unfair to the older ones. After all, it was I, as their father, who decided to have them. As long as I can still work, still go to work, I have to grit my teeth and bear it. I'm not someone without a sense of responsibility, and I wouldn't do something like giving birth but not raising them*.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly,\n\nfeeling somewhat annoyed.\n\nThen he lit one of his own cigarettes and took a puff.\n\n\"Master, seriously, please go a bit faster.\" Zhou Ze was starting to miss his freezer, and also regretted not asking Doctor Lin to drive him back earlier.\n\n\"Don't be in such a hurry, young man. It's New Year's, and we're fated to meet, aren't we? No need to rush. I get it, I get it, I'm an experienced driver...\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash,\n\naccidentally missing the car window,\n\na clump of ash landed on the inside of the car door.\n\nImmediately afterward,\n\nthe inside of the car door was burned by the ash, creating a hole,\n\na thumb-sized hole,\n\nand the cool wind outside whistled continuously into the small hole.\n___\n*   **山無棱天地合 (shān wú léng tiān dì hé)**: An idiom from ancient Chinese poetry, meaning \"mountains crumble, heaven and earth merge.\" It signifies an unchanging, eternal love, often implying 'until the end of time.'\n*   **無官一身輕 (wú guān yī shēn qīng)**: An idiom meaning \"a man without office is free from care.\" It implies a sense of liberation or detachment after letting go of responsibilities or ambitions.\n*   **死了都要愛 (sǐ le dōu yào ài)**: A phrase, also the title of a popular Chinese song, meaning \"love until death\" or \"love even after death,\" emphasizing undying devotion.\n*   **哪壺不開提哪壺 (nǎ hú bù kāi tí nǎ hú)**: Literally \"which pot isn't boiling, lift that pot.\" It means to bring up a sore subject or hit a raw nerve.\n*   **有志不在年高 (yǒu zhì bù zài nián gāo)**: An idiom meaning \"ambition isn't tied to age,\" or \"where there's a will, there's a way, regardless of age.\"\n*   **命里盡犯背字兒 (mìng lǐ jìn fàn bèi zì er)**: A colloquial expression meaning \"fate is always against you\" or \"always having bad luck.\"\n*   **人來瘋 (rén lái fēng)**: A colloquial term meaning \"gets excited when there are people around,\" or \"gets carried away when provoked/in company.\"\n*   **管生不管養 (guǎn shēng bù guǎn yǎng)**: A colloquial expression meaning \"to only give birth but not raise,\" implying a lack of responsibility after bringing a child into the world.",

    "content": "For those unfamiliar with cars, buying one is a real headache. They inevitably ask friends or relatives who are knowledgeable, as some cars indeed have their disadvantages and potential issues, be it with quality or performance.\n\nBut fundamentally,\n\nA car door that can be directly burned through with a cigarette butt –\n\nYou can't simply gloss over it by saying \"the car has quality problems\" anymore, can you?\n\nAll of this only proves one thing:\n\nThis is a…\n\nPaper car!^([1])\n\nThe driver was middle-aged, but his eldest son was probably only elementary school age. Because of this, the driver said this car was \"shāo\" (捎) given to him by his son.^([2])\n\nActually, the \"shāo\" (捎) here,\n\nCould also be written as \"shāo\" (燒).^([3])\n\nDad died,\n\nThe son burned a paper car for him.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. Honestly, he really hadn't noticed it beforehand. It was only after getting into the car that he belatedly sensed something amiss, but he still wanted to pretend to be oblivious.\n\nHe himself was originally a \"stowaway\" ^([4]), and he didn't have the inclination to be a Celestial Master Zhang.^([5])\n\nAfter all, he was also a ghost.\n\nIf he were to raise the banner of exorcising demons and defending the righteous path, then he would truly be no different from a *hanjian*^([6]); he'd be called a \"ghostjian.\"^([7])\n\nHe placed his palm over the small hole, covering it. Zhou Ze pretended to be sleepy, eyes half-closed, acting as if nothing had happened.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when he was in the orphanage, there was an orphanage teacher. This teacher usually led them in physical activities classes and also had a part-time job—guarding the gate.\n\nAnd because his surname was Qin, the children at that time called him—Gatekeeper Old Qin.\n\nOld Qin was very good at telling stories and often told ghost stories. He seemed very satisfied when the children showed scared expressions upon hearing his tales. For this, the director also had several talks with him, but he did not restrain himself.\n\nHowever, just before Zhou Ze left the orphanage to study outside, Old Qin passed away due to a myocardial infarction.\n\nZhou Ze remembered a ghost story Old Qin had told back then, called \"Ghosts Carrying a Sedan Chair.\"\n\nLegend has it that in ancient times, ghosts were also divided into many types. Most people, after dying, would go directly to the Underworld,^([8]) enter the Yellow Springs,^([9]) drink Granny Meng's Soup,^([10]) and then re-enter reincarnation.^([11]) Very few ghosts could remain in the mortal world.^([12])\n\nBut some ghosts remained. They might know they are dead, or they might not, but regardless, they might still be doing what they did when they were alive.\n\nFor example, sedan chair bearers.\n\nThey would specifically appear on roads in desolate wilderness or late at night when all was quiet, asking people if they wanted a sedan chair ride. The price was set extremely cheaply. After the person took the sedan chair to their destination, payment and service were settled.\n\nBut for the living to do business with ghosts, to enjoy services provided by ghosts, it would ultimately not be so simple or ordinary. \"Ghosts Carrying a Sedan Chair\" didn't want money, that kind of vulgar object,^([13]) but rather your lifespan,^([14]) or your vital essence, energy, or spirit.^([15])\n\nIn the underworld, ghosts carried sedan chairs for figures like King Yama.^([16]) What status do living people have? Are they worthy?\n\nJust like an eighty-year-old man kneeling to you would shorten your lifespan.^([17])\n\nZhou Ze remembered this story, and very clearly. In fact, Zhou Ze still remembered many stories Old Qin told, even after growing up and starting work, he hadn't forgotten them.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze knew clearly that the day before Old Qin died from his sudden illness, Old Qin, who had always only guarded the gate and never entered the backyard, exceptionally walked into the children's dormitory, looking at each room, looking at each child. Zhou Ze happened to be awake then and witnessed this scene.\n\nIt seemed as if Old Qin knew his time was near and came to say goodbye in advance.\n\nJust as Warren Buffett farting could make people think there's a great secret to wealth inside,\n\nA person who knows they might \"GG\" tomorrow^([18]) – the ghost stories he told could no longer truly be regarded as absurd talk.\n\nThe driver was still chattering incessantly, continuing to brag. Zhou Ze remained calm in the back.\n\nShorten lifespan?\n\nHarm vital essence/spirit?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't very scared. He wasn't a living person; he was also a ghost.\n\nTo put it bluntly, although Zhou Ze didn't understand the stratification and hierarchy of ghosts, the fact that he could walk in sunlight, meet living people, and open a business surely meant he was much higher-ranked than the lonely wandering ghosts outside, right?\n\nMoreover, even the Faceless Woman in the hellish pond could be hurt by his fingernails. When facing other ghostly entities, Zhou Ze actually felt quite confident deep down.\n\n\"These past few years, more people are buying and driving cars, and more people are breaking the rules.\" The driver continued chatting. Even though Zhou Ze didn't agree or respond, he could still keep the conversation going.\n\n\"When the forest is big, all kinds of birds appear.^([19]) In short, if you really get angry at every single one, you'll genuinely shorten your life by many years.\n\nAlthough I know deep down I shouldn't get angry, but some people, when they go out, are like they have a label stuck on their forehead saying, 'Hit me, you bastard, hit me quickly!' It's really infuriating.\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly. He felt a bit sleepy, even wanting to sleep.\n\nBut he knew he couldn't fall asleep. And therefore, this clear sensation appearing now should be fake.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly burst into a wry laugh.\n\nHe understood why the driver had been chattering incessantly throughout the journey. It wasn't that he didn't know his constant talking was annoying;\n\nIt was because Zhou Ze hadn't fallen asleep, so he had to keep talking to pretend everything was normal.\n\nHe wanted Zhou Ze to fall asleep,\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's reaction to sleep had always been very dull.\n\nA faint smile appeared at the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth. He placed his hand on the car seat and closed his eyes.\n\nSleep.\n\nThe car began to slow down.\n\nThe driver's voice also grew quieter as Zhou Ze fell asleep.\n\nAt the same time, the driver specifically turned his head to look behind him.\n\nHowever, at this moment, a look of struggle suddenly appeared on the driver's face. Finally, he shook his head vigorously, sighed, and continued driving forward.\n\nIt seemed they were almost at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure how a ghost driving a paper car could transport him, a person with a physical body.\n\nThis was difficult to explain, as physics had no \"ghost mechanics\" branch;\n\nFurthermore, in ancient Chinese legends, there were concepts like \"Yellow Turban Warriors\"^([20]) and \"Qimen Dunjia\"^([21]). Presumably, it should be similar to the principles mentioned above.\n\nZhou Ze slowly woke up because he sensed that the driver's body in front of him was slowly emitting light.\n\nInteresting.\n\nHe seemed to have been encountering \"good ghosts\" recently.\n\nThis driver should have been \"collecting payment\" from him. But he couldn't bring himself to do it; it was probably his first time doing something like this, and he couldn't go through with it. In this struggle, he achieved self-liberation and redemption.\n\nHe began to dissipate.\n\nAfter dissipating, he would enter hell and reincarnation.\n\nFrom this, it was clear that not all the \"nonsense\" the driver had said earlier was false. He had four children, he liked the feeling of being a father. He worked hard to earn money and support his family, providing his children with a good upbringing environment.\n\nHe was a good father. In terms of character and personality, he was decent. After becoming a ghost, he wanted to try his hand at the \"Ghosts Carrying a Sedan Chair\" business, but ultimately, his heart was too soft.\n\nZhou Ze slowly lifted his head and opened his eyes. The driver didn't notice, still driving along by himself.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze noticed light shining in from outside. Through the window, he could see the bustling traffic on the road.\n\nThe driver was about to dissipate.\n\nThis must be a memory from the driver's life.\n\nPerhaps similar to the principle where lightning combined with special circumstances can record a scene.\n\nZhou Ze unconsciously lit a cigarette again. Since the driver had already achieved self-liberation, then it didn't matter even if he burned the car down himself.\n\nMusic was playing in the car; it was \"Liang Liang,\"^([22]) a song that was recently quite popular.\n\nThe driver hummed along while driving. He must have just finished a big job and was in a good mood, planning to go back and add a plate of peanuts^([23]) for himself and video call with his children for a while. Although life was hard, it was still quite sweet.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw a minibus appear on the road in front of the car.\n\nIt should be a school bus, with a school emblem printed on it, and the words \"XXX Elementary School.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't pay it any mind at first, but suddenly, a girl stood up in the back seat of the minibus. She faced the back of the vehicle; even sitting in the car behind, one could clearly see her through the bus window.\n\nThe girl was wearing a blue lily skirt; she was very cute.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nHe knew this girl; he had saved her. She had reportedly woken up. Recently, Doctor Lin had even told him that the girl's father wanted to hold a thank-you banquet and had originally intended to invite him.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze darkened slightly. So, this driver was the culprit behind this car accident?\n\nSo many children were injured.\n\nAnd if he hadn't intervened, children would have died.\n\n\"What a pretty little girl, just like my youngest.\"\n\nThe driver muttered to himself. This was the last memory scene from his life, so he didn't know that someone was still sitting behind his seat at that moment.\n\nZhou Ze looked in all directions. He didn't think the driver was drunk, nor did he seem to have any other issues. So, what exactly caused the driver to hit the school bus? What led to that car accident?\n\nWas it a chain collision caused by nearby vehicles?\n\nAnd at this moment,\n\nThe girl who was originally standing at the back of the school bus, wearing the lily skirt, suddenly opened her mouth, and her tongue came out.\n\nYes,\n\nIt came out,\n\nUnfurled like a red carpet, directly out, very long... very long... so long it made one's scalp tingle.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nWith a mocking smile in her eyes, the girl stared intently at the driver in front of her.\n\n\"Oh my god, a ghost!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nIn his panic, the driver stepped on the accelerator. The car directly crashed into the school bus in front.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nSparks flew.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the entrance of the bookstore.\n\nOn the ground all around were the ashes of the not-yet-fully-burned paper car, scattering with the wind, swirling and falling, transforming into the last few specks.\n\nZhou Ze had no injuries, not a single one.\n\nAnd the driver had also kept his promise, delivering him to his destination.\n\nBut Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to go back into the bookstore.\n\nIn his hand, he still held the cigarette, slowly burning.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital, you know.\" The girl's voice still echoed in his ears.\n\nHe himself,\n\nWhat *thing* exactly,\n\nHad he saved?\n\n---\n^([1]) A replica of a car made of paper, burned as a funerary offering to the deceased in Chinese traditional practices.\n^([2]) The character 捎 (shāo) means \"to give\" or \"to bring along.\"\n^([3]) The character 燒 (shāo) means \"to burn.\" This creates a pun, as both characters are pronounced similarly.\n^([4]) Here, referring to someone who has illegally crossed from the realm of the dead to the living.\n^([5]) Zhang Tianshi (張天師), or Celestial Master Zhang, is a famous figure in Taoist mythology, known for his power to exorcise demons.\n^([6]) *Hanjian* (漢奸): A pejorative term for a traitor to the Han Chinese people or to China.\n^([7]) A term coined by the narrator, a play on *hanjian*, implying a traitor to ghosts.\n^([8]) *Yin Cao Di Fu* (陰曹地府): The Underworld or Netherworld in Chinese mythology.\n^([9]) *Huang Quan* (黃泉): The Yellow Springs, the realm of the dead in Chinese mythology, similar to Hades.\n^([10]) *Meng Po Tang* (孟婆湯): Granny Meng's Soup, a mythical drink in the Underworld that makes souls forget their past lives before reincarnation.\n^([11]) Reincarnation (輪迴): The cycle of death and rebirth.\n^([12]) *Yang Jian* (陽間): The mortal world, the realm of the living.\n^([13]) *A Du Wu* (阿堵物): A contemptuous classical Chinese term for money, literally \"that stuff.\"\n^([14]) *Shou Yuan* (壽元): One's allotted lifespan or longevity.\n^([15]) *Jing Qi Shen* (精氣神): Refers to the \"essence, vital energy, and spirit\" in traditional Chinese philosophy and medicine, representing one's life force.\n^([16]) King Yama (閻王): The King of Hell in Chinese mythology, who presides over the Underworld.\n^([17]) *Zhe Shou* (折壽): To shorten one's lifespan, often as a consequence of receiving excessive respect or blessings one is not worthy of, or due to karmic retribution.\n^([18]) \"GG\" is internet slang for \"Good Game,\" often used to mean \"game over\" or \"to die.\"\n^([19]) \"When the forest is big, all kinds of birds appear\" (林子大了，什麼鳥都有): A Chinese idiom meaning \"There are all kinds of people in the world,\" implying a diverse and often unruly mix.\n^([20]) *Huang Jin Li Shi* (黃巾力士): Yellow Turban Warriors, mythical spiritual soldiers or guardians in Daoist magic.\n^([21]) *Qimen Dunjia* (奇門遁甲): An ancient Chinese divination and metaphysical art, often associated with strategic planning and occult practices.\n^([22]) \"Liang Liang\" (涼涼): A popular Chinese song, literally meaning \"cool\" or \"cold,\" often colloquially used to imply something is going wrong or ending.\n^([23]) Peanuts (*huasheng mir*): A common snack in China, often served with alcoholic drinks. Here, it implies a small, simple pleasure.",

    "title": "Chapter 18: Trouble Stirs Again!",
    "content": "The next morning, after washing up, Zhou Ze, as usual, came to the noodle shop next door. This had gradually become a habit of his life. When eating was no longer an enjoyable process, it purely became a task. For tasks, simple and efficient was best, and nowhere was more convenient and quicker than Xu Qinglang’s place.\n\n“Bitter melon juice.” Xu Qinglang placed a large glass cup in front of Zhou Ze, then served him a portion of egg fried rice.\n\nZhou Ze first tried a sip. The moment the liquid entered his throat, he only felt an unbearable bitterness between his lips and teeth. Immediately after swallowing it, even his intestines and stomach began to knot up.\n\nAfter waiting for about ten seconds, Zhou Ze recovered and let out a long breath.\n\nSo bitter.\n\n“Haha, intense enough, huh?” Xu Qinglang had a “hurry up and praise me” expression, then sat down in front of Zhou Ze. “By the way, you really have a heavy palate. You can’t eat without drinking this stuff?”\n\nZhou Ze calmed his mood, then picked up the full large glass of bitter melon juice and drank it all in one gulp. Immediately after, he quickly picked up his chopsticks and began to wolf down the egg fried rice in front of him.\n\nA minute later, Zhou Ze finished his meal, put down the plate, then closed his eyes.\n\n“That eating style, it’s exactly like a demon crawled up from hell,” Xu Qinglang teased.\n\nBut whether this was a tease or had some other meaning, it was unknown.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes and glanced at the other person. That day, during the Head Seven* when the five migrant worker brothers’ souls returned, it was normal that his sister-in-law and wife couldn’t see them. Only this noodle shop owner could see them; otherwise, he wouldn’t have made those five portions of braised pork rice.\n\nBut between the two of them, adhering to the unspoken understanding of “seeing through something but not saying it,” they had never pierced the paper window**. Perhaps, this was the way to get along.\n\n“Why aren’t you taking orders today?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\nIn the past few days, even on New Year’s Eve, Xu Qinglang’s phone kept receiving delivery orders. But today, it seemed much quieter, and no delivery riders were seen coming to pick up food.\n\n“Rest.” Xu Qinglang took out a cigarette, put one in his mouth, and offered one to Zhou Ze.\n\nAlthough not resting on New Year’s Eve but resting after the New Year was a bit strange,\nas a man with over twenty apartments,\nhe certainly had the capital to be willful.\n\n“Do you know about ghost sedan-chair bearers***?” Zhou Ze asked. The events of last night were still fresh in his memory, but he wasn’t in a hurry to do anything, only went home and slept in his freezer. The person was indeed saved by Zhou Ze himself. If there were any problems, Zhou Ze didn’t want to bother. He was just carefully, earnestly yet cheerfully living his own little life. Ordinarily, if he encountered something he could conveniently do, he would do it, but he wouldn’t actually force anything. Even if that little girl in the lily dress really had some problem, it was no longer Zhou Ze’s business to handle.\n\n“Ghost sedan-chair bearers?” Xu Qinglang was stunned for a moment, then laughed: “Heh heh, there are probably more on New Year’s Eve, right? It’s said that when people burn sutras and joss paper for the New Year, those ghosts also have extra money on hand and can afford to take a taxi.”\n\nXu Qinglang continued to talk nonsense, then yawned. “By the way, why is your bookstore still not open?”\n\n“I’ll open it in the evening.”\n\n“Alright, willful.” Xu Qinglang took out his phone, glanced at it twice. “How about we go see a movie this afternoon?”\n\nThe scene\nimmediately entered an awkward silence.\n\n“No.” Zhou Ze refused.\n\n“See, you’re really not giving me face. It’s a waste of all my hard work concocting new juice for you, and you’re not even willing to accompany me to a movie. Men, none of them are good.”\n\n“…………” Zhou Ze.\n\n“Sorry, I forgot I’m a man too.” Xu Qinglang shook his head somewhat plaintively, with an expression of regretting why he wasn’t born a woman.\n\n“Did you experience some psychological trauma when you were little?” Zhou Ze asked. “I do know some psychologists who can help you.”\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed,\n“Heterosexuality is just a heresy created for reproduction; only same-sex love can be true love.”\n\n“I beg to differ.”\n\n“Those who walk different paths cannot plan together.”\n\nThe two’s post-meal conversation thus ended unhappily.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore, opened the door, thought for a moment, and didn’t lock it. He simply sat behind the counter, opened his computer, and sent a WeChat message to Dr. Lin:\n\n“Go see a movie this afternoon?”\n\nAfter waiting for about ten minutes, Dr. Lin replied:\n\n“Working.”\n\nNew Year’s doesn’t mean people aren’t allowed to get sick or have an accident. Zhou Ze, who was also once a doctor, knew that hospital holidays were largely nominal****.\n\nThinking about it, he could understand, but ultimately, it was a bit unsatisfying.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to tell her that he was Zhou Ze, not some darn Xu Le. But he also worried that the result would be Dr. Lin being so scared that she’d doubt her life, and even the vague, unrequited crush she had earlier would be destroyed. Of course, most importantly, the fewer people who knew about certain things, the better.\n\nSomeone would come to catch him, Zhou Ze was very clear about this. He was waiting, and while waiting, he didn’t choose to curl up shivering in some dark corner like a rat in a sewer. He still needed to live, and he needed to live normally. Otherwise, it would be better not to have come out of hell and just walked the Yellow Springs Road***** with the main group.\n\nAs for the neighbor next door, whether he had figured it out or not, Zhou Ze didn’t know and was too lazy to find out.\n\n“In the evening then.”\n\nDr. Lin sent another message.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. He felt his smile was like an idiot’s, exactly like returning to his middle school days when he saw the class study monitor glance shyly at him.\n\nBefore, he lived too tiring a life.\n\nThis life, he had to live a bit more freely and unrestrained.\n\nMany truths of life can only truly be understood and seen clearly right before death or when old. But by the time you understand, you’ve already lost the chance to start over.\n\nZhou Ze cherished his current life and opportunities.\n\nA red sedan stopped on the road in front of the bookstore, and two women got out.\n\nOne was under thirty, and the other looked only five or six years old.\n\nThe woman wore a red dress, her hair flowing. Although a mother, she still couldn’t conceal her charm and allure; instead, she was even more capable of stirring people’s heartstrings.\n\nThe girl wore overalls, and probably several layers of thermal clothing underneath, wrapped like a small zongzi******, charmingly naive and cute.\n\nBut when he saw the girl, Zhou Ze’s eyes instinctively narrowed.\n\n“Those who come with ill intentions are not kind, and the kind do not come*******.” He hadn’t gone to find her, but she had come looking for him.\n\nPreviously, when he heard Dr. Lin say that the other party called him “uncle” at the thank-you banquet, Zhou Ze was still smug. Now, thinking about it, the other party never intended to let him go.\n\nAfter all, the death of that father with four children was because of this girl.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. The woman looked around curiously, while the girl timidly walked up to Zhou Ze’s counter, looked at Zhou Ze, and said in a soft, sweet voice:\n\n“Hello, Uncle.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded, somewhat reservedly. In reality, he was thinking whether he should just take out his nails and strangle this girl to death.\n\n“Hello, I’m Ruirui’s mom.”\n\nThe woman walked up to Zhou Ze and placed a gift box on the counter.\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nThe woman bowed to Zhou Ze, deeply sincere.\n\n“You’re too kind.” Zhou Ze still didn’t get up.\n\nHe really wanted to pretend everything was normal so that the girl wouldn’t notice anything.\n\nBut it was too difficult. Even an Oscar-winning actor, after seeing the driver’s pre-death memories last night, would probably find it hard to maintain a normal expression in front of this girl, right?\n\nSince pretending didn’t look like pretending, he might as well not pretend at all.\n\n“Mommy, I want to read a book here,” Ruirui said to the woman.\n\n“Alright, Mom will go get her hair done first, you stay here with Uncle and read.” The woman smiled at Zhou Ze. “Thank you for your trouble.”\n\n“No trouble at all.”\n\n“It was only by asking Dr. Lin that I knew you opened a shop here.”\n\nBusybody.\n\n“You and Dr. Lin truly are a perfect match.”\n\nThis was said so insincerely; even Xu Le himself wouldn’t believe it, right?\n\nThe woman drove away, leaving her daughter. This was originally a bookstore, and Zhou Ze was half her daughter’s savior and also Dr. Lin’s husband, so she was very relieved to leave her daughter here and didn’t need to worry about anything happening.\n\nNext, Ruirui chose an illustrated book herself and sat on a plastic stool, reading.\n\nShe didn’t make noise, nor did she fuss.\n\nShe didn’t ask for drinks, nor did she fuss for snacks.\n\nZhou Ze sat behind the counter, watching her.\n\nJust at this moment, Xu Qinglang walked in, saw the little girl who was like a porcelain doll, and immediately walked over and picked her up.\n\n“Oh, what a cute little girl.”\n\n“Thank you, big sister,” Ruirui replied.\n\nThe smile on Xu Qinglang’s face bloomed like a chrysanthemum, becoming even more radiant.\n\nThe little girl’s flattery hit Xu Qinglang’s sweet spot.\n\nZhou Ze, however, kept a sullen face, continuing to sit there.\n\n“Come out, I have something to tell you.” Xu Qinglang put the child down and pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked out.\n\n“Someone from the plaza came to ask if we want to terminate the contract. They can refund us the previously prepaid rent.”\n\n“Let’s not get it refunded.” Zhou Ze temporarily didn’t want to make more trouble, not to mention he didn’t have enough capital. Even if he got the prepaid rent back, it wouldn’t be enough for him to open another shop.\n\n“That’s what I think too.” Xu Qinglang nodded, indicating he understood. “Then I’ll go negotiate on your behalf?”\n\n“Alright.”\n\n“Okay, it’s settled then.”\n\nThe two stood outside the shop door and smoked a cigarette before parting ways.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze turned around, pushed open the shop door, and walked in,\n\nhe found that the little girl was no longer on the row of small plastic stools, and the illustrated book was left on one of the stools.\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nHe looked up,\n\nand at the stairwell, there were the sounds of small leather boots. The little girl walked out from there, half her body visible, half blocked by the wall.\n\nShe had just gone to his second floor.\n___\n* **Head Seven (頭七):** The first of seven seven-day cycles of mourning in traditional Chinese custom, believed to be the time when the deceased's soul returns home.\n** **Pierced the paper window (捅破窗戶紙):** An idiom meaning to reveal the truth or to stop pretending, literally \"to pierce the paper window.\"\n*** **Ghost sedan-chair bearers (鬼抬轎):** Refers to a supernatural phenomenon or legend where ghosts are seen traveling in an invisible sedan chair or palanquin.\n**** **Largely nominal (水分太大):** Literally \"too much moisture,\" a Chinese idiom meaning unreliable, superficial, or having a lot of unverified elements.

    "content": "\"Did you go up and see?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little loli shook her head, \"It's dark up there, can't see anything clearly.\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the little loli slowly walked down, and then stood in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nShe was very short, dressed in many layers, and her delicate face was like a masterpiece of art.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew her tongue could be very, very long... long enough to make one's scalp tingle.\n\n\"Uncle, I'm going to continue reading.\"\n\nThe little loli smiled artlessly, sat back down on the small plastic stool, picked up the illustrated children's book, and continued to read it with great interest.\n\nZhou Ze stood behind her, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\nChoke her,\nChoke her,\nNo matter what her intentions,\nThere's no need for her to keep playing tricks anymore!\n\nThis voice echoed in Zhou Ze's heart; it wasn't anyone else's voice, but Zhou Ze's own inner thoughts.\n\nCompared to Xu Qinglang, the noodle shop owner next door, this little loli in front of him gave Zhou Ze a great deal of irritation and revulsion.\n\nIt was he who rescued her,\nShe was very cute,\nVery sensible,\nVery well-behaved,\nVery learned and reasonable,\nPossessing a sense of duty and discipline rare for a child her age.\n\nPerhaps,\nPrecisely because her initial impression had been so exceptionally good, when Zhou Ze witnessed her true nature, the distortion and reversal of expectations in their interpersonal dynamic intensified Zhou Ze's revulsion and rejection of her.\n\nThe little loli continued to read her book, seemingly completely oblivious and indifferent to Zhou Ze behind her.\n\nZhou Ze stared at her, seeing even the fine downy hairs on the back of her neck clearly.\n\nChoke,\nDon't choke,\nUltimately,\nTo choke or not to choke?\n\n***\n\n\"Father, Mother, your son is resting today.\"\n\nIn the inner room, Xu Qinglang had set a few cold dishes and a few hot dishes on a small table, along with two cups of wine.\n\nOne cup was Maotai, his father's favorite kind when he was alive.\n\nThe other cup was homemade rice wine; his mother didn't drink when she was alive and was very against his father drinking. Occasionally, at banquets, if the hosts were too enthusiastic, his mother would only drink a little rice wine.\n\nHis mother often said that rice wine nourished people.\n\nAt the east and west corners of the small table, there were also two candlesticks, their flames flickering.\n\nTwo human skins hung behind the seats, swaying as if by themselves without any wind.\n\nXu Qinglang first toasted his father, then had a small sip with his mother.\n\nPicking up his chopsticks, he said to his parents:\n\n\"Eat, eat! Dad, you're going to try and snatch my meat again!\"\n\nHe himself picked up several pieces of meat and wolfed them down.\n\nHe remembered that when he was a child, his father always liked to pretend to snatch meat from him, but each time he would tell him to quickly gobble it down, leaving his mouth stuffed and unable to swallow.\n\nAnd his mother would then lovingly scold his father while gently patting his back.\n\nToday was the first day of the Lunar New Year.\n\nMost people worship their ancestors before the New Year.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang was different; he did it on this day because his parents had died together on this day due to an accident.\n\nThe New Year,\nWhile it might have lost some of its \"New Year's flavor\" in the eyes of ordinary people compared to before, for Xu Qinglang, it meant the return of his heartbreaking moment.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\nXu Qinglang smiled,\nAnd said:\n\n\"Father, Mother.\"\n\nHe pursed his lips,\nXu Qinglang poured himself another cup of baijiu and drank it in one gulp.\n\nThe spicy liquor made his already delicate and charming face become even redder and more supple.\n\nHe was a man,\nYet a 'femme fatale'*. Of course, if he lived in ancient times, he would surely be a kept person for many emperors and nobles. Even in modern times, if he wished, he could live a very smooth and easy life.\n\nHow terrifying a man who could turn straight men gay was, went without saying.\n\nAfter long hesitation,\nAfter long contemplation,\nXu Qinglang still couldn't hold back.\nHe said:\n\n\"Next door... that person next door, I'll find a chance to ask him, ask him... ask him how he really came back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't drunk, but his speech was a little unclear.\n\nClearly,\nHe knew in his heart that the person next door wouldn't just sit down and tell him the answer like they were having a casual chat.\n\nThis process,\nWould ultimately be unpleasant and would require him to use some methods.\n\nThe two human skins stopped swaying.\nSeemingly displeased.\n\n\"Father, Mother, it's alright, your son will definitely bring you back to life!\"\n\n\"Clatter!\"\n\"Clatter!\"\n\nTwo pairs of chopsticks fell to the ground.\nXu Qinglang, holding his own chopsticks, paused for a moment.\n\nBut he still shook his head,\n\"No, I can't listen to you this time. Even if you disagree, I'll still pry the answer out of him!\"\n\n***\n\nChoke,\nOr not choke?\n\nZhou Ze was still pondering this question.\n\nHe didn't know why he was so hesitant, nor did he understand what exactly he was struggling with.\n\nHe was a ghost,\nNo longer a doctor from his previous life.\n\nHe was dangerous, and his situation was very precarious. Therefore, he knew he should nip all dangers in the bud.\n\nThis little loli was his threat.\n\nShe had come to find him,\nShe had come on her own initiative,\nJust as her soul had sought him out to speak that day.\n\nShe,\nMust have been watching him for a long time.\n\nThe story of the farmer and the snake, even children understood it. Zhou Ze didn't believe that just because he had once saved her, everything would be fine.\n\nIn fact, most enmities in this world evolved from kindness.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails had slowly grown long, and at the same time, wisps of black mist were swirling around his fingertips.\n\nSimultaneously,\nA dark sheen was swirling in the depths of Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nHe must choke her,\nChoke her!\n\nZhou Ze repeated this to himself over and over in his heart. He had barely managed to gain this rebirth; he still had a life, and things he wanted to do.\n\nHe still wanted to be lazy, to reminisce, to think,\nNot like the old and young on the Yellow Springs Road**, numb and hollow, knowing only how to walk step by step forward.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hands,\nSlowly approaching the little loli.\n\nThe little loli was reading, very earnestly, with a smile on her lips, very cute and endearing.\n\nSuddenly, she felt two fingers placed on her temples.\n\nShe asked with some doubt, \"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Massaging you, to protect your eyes.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" The little loli responded, and continued to read her book.\n\nA perfectly weighted pressure came from her temples, and the little loli felt very comfortable.\n\nSubsequently,\nThe little loli watched as her uncle silently walked to the chair behind the counter and sat down.\n\n\"Uncle, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nThe little loli continued to lower her head and read her book.\n\nThen,\n\"Smack!\" A crisp sound.\n\nThe little loli raised her head, looked towards the counter again, and saw one side of Zhou Ze's face was bright red.\n\n\"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Swatting a mosquito.\" Zhou Ze let out a complete sigh of relief, then leaned back in the chair, letting out an internal sigh: Damn it, I still couldn't do it. How useless am I?\n\nThe little loli apparently didn't realize there would be mosquitoes in the dead of winter, but she still stood up and looked around, as if helping Zhou Ze search for the mosquito.\n\nDamn it,\nKeep pretending,\nYou're such a drama queen***!\nStill acting!\nAnd acting so realistically!\nQuickly, stick out your tongue,\nLet's have a fight!\nHow great would it be if you killed me or I killed you,\nStill wearing a loli face, banking on me not being able to do it****?\nI... really can't do it.\nFuck!\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit helpless. He turned and went to the bathroom, turned on the faucet, and splashed cold water hard on his face.\n\n\"Before, I was a doctor; healing and saving lives was instinct, a profession,\nYou damn well turned into a ghost,\nHow are you still such a pushover*****!\nUseless piece of trash!\"\n\nZhou Ze started scolding his reflection in the mirror.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze also realized that the frequency of him scolding himself lately seemed to be higher than the frequency of him scolding Xu Le.\n\nMeanwhile, the little loli, who had been sitting in the bookstore reading, put down her book at this moment.\n\nShe cast a profound glance towards the bathroom door but didn't walk that way. Instead, she walked out of the bookstore,\nAnd went next door.\n\n***\n\n\"Father, Mother, no matter how you try to dissuade me, it's useless. I want you to sit down and eat with me properly. If he can do it, I can also turn you into that!\n\nOur family can continue to live together, just like before.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was still rambling.\n\nSuddenly,\nThe two human skins that had been hanging by the small table began to sway wildly as if they were mad.\n\nXu Qinglang's face showed shock. He looked up at the yellow talismans pasted above his inner room, only to find that those talismans had, for some reason, turned gray.\n\nHe abruptly pulled back the curtain and rushed out.\n\nHe saw a little girl standing in his noodle shop.\n\nThe girl opened her mouth,\nA long tongue stretched out,\nVery long,\nVery long,\nFrighteningly long!\n\n\"The Underworld has order, the deceased shall depart.\"\n\nThe next moment, the two human skins in the inner room began to wither, decay, losing their luster and flexibility. Two streams of white mist trickled out, landing beside the little girl and transforming into the figures of a man and a woman in middle age.\n\nThey swayed unsteadily,\nSeemingly having forgotten everything,\nKnowing only to walk dazed and confused, step by step, along the long tongue the girl had spat out from her mouth, as if the girl's tongue was their destination, leading to some unknown place.\n\nGradually, their figures began to fade, becoming more and more indistinct.\n\n\"You... you actually... you actually are...\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed at the sweet-talking little loli he had just recently held, his face filled with shock. But when he saw his parents slowly disappearing,\n\nHe immediately tried to rush over hysterically. However, his feet seemed to be shackled, he couldn't run, and instead fell heavily to the ground.\n\nHe stretched out his hand, pointing at his parents, and began to plead sorrowfully:\n\n\"Don't take them away, don't take them away,\nI haven't harmed anyone,\nI've never harmed anyone,\nI just want our family to be together,\nThey haven't harmed anyone either!\nNo, no, please, I beg you, I beg you...\"\n\nHowever, facing Xu Qinglang's tearful pleas,\n\nThe little loli remained unmoved. Only after the two souls had completely vanished did she retract her long tongue, and then transform back into her cute loli appearance.\n\nXu Qinglang felt as if two pieces had been forcibly gouged out of his chest.\n\nHis parents,\nHad completely left him.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot. He vigorously pounded the tiled floor, hitting it hard.\n\nSuddenly,\nHe seemed to remember something,\nImmediately pointed at next door, and roared:\n\n\"He's not human either, he's not human either,\nWhy don't you take him, why don't you take him?!\nThis isn't fair, what you've done isn't fair!\nHe's not human either,\nWhy do you only take my parents,\nHe's not human either,\nIt's not fair,\nIt's not fair!!!!!\"\n\n---\n*紅顏禍水 (hóngyán huòshuǐ): Literally \"red face, disaster water.\" An idiom for a beautiful woman who brings disaster, a femme fatale.

    "content": "The bathroom wasn't really well-renovated by Xu Le; it only had a simple sink and a squat toilet, not even a showerhead. As for the second floor, let alone a bed, originally not even a straw mat was placed there; it was purely used as a small storage room, because back then, Xu Le used to go home every day.\n\nEven though his parents-in-law looked down on him,\n\nEven though he had a bossy sister-in-law,\n\nEven though he had a wife who wouldn't sleep with him,\n\nXu Le would still leisurely close the bookstore every night after finishing the few tasks there and head home.\n\nThis was life;\n\nIt couldn't be called dignified,\n\nNor could it be called free,\n\nBut he bore it willingly.¹\n\nHe was spineless, he was timid, he lacked ambition.\n\nBecause he was Xu Le, not some historical figure who left a name behind, people thought he didn't matter;\n\nIf one were to overlay the identity of some ancient historical figure, Xu Le's life would then be seen as great wisdom appearing foolish, gratuitously adding too much flavor to it.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't experience Xu Le's 'flavor' (his way of life); having grown up in an orphanage, the feeling of inferiority, though not outwardly expressed, had always been present. This made him sensitive and driven, whether in his studies, his work, or his personal life, always striving to be the best and most outstanding.\n\nHowever, right now, looking at the wet face in the mirror, a hint of pity emerged in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nPity for Xu Le, and pity for himself.\n\nEveryone has their own cage; it's just that the style and size of the cages differ, but there is always a cage.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to be some Ghost King, nor did he dream of wielding special powers to command wind and rain in the mortal realm. On the one hand, he knew that if he became too high-profile, bad things would likely happen immediately. On the other hand, his last life had been exhausting, and this life he wanted to live differently.\n\nNo matter what, he wanted to survive, to continue living in this physical body.\n\nHe spread his palm and held it in front of him; his fingernails had long since faded, showing no abnormality.\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nNever mind.\n\nPerhaps he deserved it.\n\nWiping his face with a towel, then his hands, Zhou Ze walked out of the bathroom. But when he re-emerged, the earlier struggle on his face was gone, replaced by a sense of liberation.\n\nThe little loli was still sitting on the plastic stool, engrossed in her picture book.\n\n\"Uncle, Ruirui is thirsty.\"\n\nThe little loli called out to Zhou Ze.\n\nLike a pet charming its owner.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, poured a cup of water into a paper cup, lukewarm, and brought it to the little loli.\n\nThe little loli took the cup, took a sip, and her lips curved into a crescent moon smile.\n\nZhou Ze simply sat down on the tiled floor and reached out to rub the little loli's head, openly and without any guard.\n\nTime slowly passed.\n\nThe little loli continued reading her book.\n\nZhou Ze continued lying beside her.\n\nOne big, one small.\n\nThey got along very well.\n\nThe little loli would bring the interesting stories she read to Zhou Ze and share them with him, and Zhou Ze responded by telling her some profound fables or other little stories.\n\nHe didn't know how long it had been when the red car drove over again.\n\nThe girl's mother pushed open the door and thanked Zhou Ze. Her hair looked the same as when she arrived. Zhou Ze curved his lips into a smile, really wanting to suggest that the woman go find that hair salon and demand an explanation; this kind of shoddy work was unacceptable.\n\nOf course, if he actually said that, the woman might blame him for being nosy.\n\nThe little loli bowed to Zhou Ze and said thank you, then left with her mother.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the little loli didn't look back at him.\n\nGone, just gone.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the counter, picked up the gift box the woman had given him earlier, and only then discovered there was a stack of cash inside, three thousand yuan.\n\nNot bad.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think of returning it.\n\nHe was short on money; he'd take it for now.\n\nZhou Ze felt he had come to terms with things, like a cultivation practitioner suddenly achieving clarity of thought; yet he also felt he was just throwing caution to the wind,² letting come what may, he would remain carefree.\n\nBut no matter what, at least he felt much more relaxed now.\n\nZhou Ze casually picked up a book with a large cover from the bookshelf. It was \"Calligraphy Masterpiece Appreciation,\" a pure unsold item. He wondered if Xu Le's head had been repeatedly crushed by a large iron gate back then, to even stock such a book.\n\nFlipping casually,\n\nThe page happened to display the four characters \"Rare is the muddle-headedness.\"³\n\n\"Tsk tsk.\"\n\nZhou Ze clicked his tongue.\n\nInteresting.\n\nHe checked the time and saw it was almost evening. Remembering that he had a movie date with Doctor Lin tonight, Zhou Ze decided to go grab some food first.\n\nWalking next door, Zhou Ze paused, seeing Xu Qinglang kneeling on the floor.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot, and many wine bottles lay beside him. At this moment, he was holding a bottle of wine and continued drinking.\n\n\"It's not fair… it's not fair…\"\n\nXu Qinglang mumbled to himself, acting as if he hadn't noticed Zhou Ze entering the shop.\n\n\"Hey?\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder, \"Are you okay?\"\n\nHe really wanted to remind Xu Qinglang that for other men, getting drunk might just mean getting robbed, but if Xu Qinglang got drunk and went out, it wouldn't be as simple as just losing money.\n\nIn fact, if he were to lie on the street late at night with a woman, Xu Qinglang might be violated more times than the woman herself.\n\nXu Qinglang's body trembled slightly. He slowly raised his head, with tears like pear blossoms bathed in rain,⁴ a pitiable sight to behold, his hand forming a *lanhua*⁵ gesture, pointing at Zhou Ze, and lamenting:\n\n\"Today is my parents' death anniversary.\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, then said, \"My condolences.\"\n\nHe waited for a while.\n\nXu Qinglang continued to drink.\n\nZhou Ze could only prompt, \"Tonight, no cooking?\"\n\n\"Cook! Cook!\"\n\nXu Qinglang wobbled to his feet. That willow-like slender waist, graceful and charming, was especially alluring, particularly his swaying, tottering posture, which made one want to go up and directly support him, to inhale the scent from his body.\n\n\"Are you sure you don't have to force yourself?\"\n\nZhou Ze said this, but still sat down on a chair, ready to eat.\n\nGetting a meal was not easy for him, so he didn't want to look for another place.\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and walked into the back room.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of the stove igniting came from inside; Xu Qinglang was stir-frying.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and saw that Doctor Lin had just sent him a message, saying she was coming to pick him up soon.\n\nZhou Ze replied with \"Okay.\"\n\nThen he thought it wasn't formal enough.\n\nHe replied again with a \"hahaha Paopao Soldier emoji.\"\n\nImmediately, he felt it was too frivolous.\n\nHe recalled the emoji.\n\nThen he thought recalling it seemed too obvious.\n\nHe replied again with \"Hehe.\"\n\nImmediately after, he felt \"Hehe\" wasn't friendly enough.\n\nBut then he thought recalling it a second time would seem too pretentious.\n\nSuch a dilemma…\n\nZhou Ze was in a dilemma at the dining table.\n\nThe other chef, who was stir-frying, was also in a dilemma.\n\nIn the wok was twice-cooked pork; once fried, it would be served over rice as a bowl of twice-cooked pork over rice—very simple and very filling.\n\n\"Why didn't she arrest you, but arrested my parents?\"\n\nXu Qinglang muttered to himself as he stir-fried.\n\nAs the old saying goes, \"Do not worry about scarcity, but about uneven distribution.\" This phrase encapsulates so many truths and reveals the darkest side of human nature.\n\n\"This isn't fair, it's really not fair.\" Xu Qinglang continued to mutter.\n\n\"How can you play favorites? How can you play favorites?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were glazed over, but his stir-frying rhythm didn't change. He was a good chef; cooking had almost become an instinct.\n\nSilently, Xu Qinglang took out a yellow jar from the cabinet under the stove, poured some powder from it, and put it into the twice-cooked pork.\n\n\"My parents were taken away, why weren't you? Could it be that you saved her life?\"\n\n\"Heh, what a joke.\"\n\n\"You want to eat?\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll give you food.\"\n\nXu Qinglang kept taking deep breaths.\n\n\"Is it ready?\" Zhou Ze urged from outside.\n\n\"Almost.\"\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment, a hint of panic and hesitation flashing in his eyes, but he still put the lid back on the wok. He realized he hadn't put his own rice in the microwave yet, so he had to re-heat the rice.\n\nAfter the rice was ready, Xu Qinglang placed the twice-cooked pork on top, then carried the plate out.\n\nZhou Ze was staring at his phone screen, struggling. Seeing Xu Qinglang approach somewhat dispiritedly and set down the food, he asked with some concern:\n\n\"Looking like that, you didn't forget to add salt, did you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks, ready to eat.\n\nXu Qinglang's hand trembled, his lips slightly parted, just about to speak, when Zhou Ze put down his chopsticks.\n\n\"Where's the sour plum juice or bitter gourd juice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, right.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked back and returned with a glass of sour plum juice.\n\nZhou Ze first picked up the sour plum juice, smelled it, then took a deep breath, preparing to drink it, when his phone vibrated.\n\n\"I'm here, come out.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then put down the sour plum juice.\n\nHe knew that after drinking that with his meal, his whole face might be sour for a long time, as if everyone around him owed him a large sum of money.\n\nThinking about it, forget it.\n\nCounting his past and present lives, this was the first time he had asked a girl out to see a movie, so he'd better be a bit more serious.\n\nNo choice. Originally, the difficulty of Doctor Lin's \"dungeon\" was a beginner's quest for him,\n\nBut now that he was in Xu Le's skin, the beginner's quest instantly turned into a BOSS-level quest.\n\nHe didn't know whether he should be secretly delighted or miserable.\n\nWhat he needed to strive for now was,\n\nTo defeat himself? Only then could he win the beauty.\n\n\"Money, put it on my tab. We'll settle it at the end of the month. I'm leaving first.\"\n\nZhou Ze got up, pushed open the door, and went out.\n\nDoctor Lin's car was parked on the side of the road, the window rolled down, waiting for him.\n\nInside the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang's expression alternated between dark and bright, then he suddenly flung the entire plate of twice-cooked pork over rice onto the floor.\n\nClutching his head, he began to cry on the floor.\n\nHe cried louder and louder,\n\nUntil finally,\n\nIt turned into dry wailing…\n\n***\n¹ **甘之如飴 (gānzhī rúyí)**: Literally \"sweet as candy.\" An idiom meaning to willingly endure hardships or find pleasure in something difficult.\n² **破罐子破摔 (pò guànzi pò shuāi)**: Literally \"broken jar, broken throw.\" An idiom meaning to abandon oneself to despair, to give up entirely and act recklessly, believing things can't get worse.\n³ **難得糊塗 (nándé hútú)**: Literally \"rare is the muddle-headedness.\" A famous saying by Qing dynasty official Zheng Banqiao, suggesting that sometimes it's wise to pretend ignorance or to be less discerning for peace of mind, akin to \"ignorance is bliss.\"\n⁴ **梨花帶雨 (líhuādàiyǔ)**: Literally \"pear blossoms bathed in rain.\" An idiom used to describe the beautiful appearance of a woman crying.\n⁵ **蘭花 (lánhuā) gesture**: A hand gesture in traditional Chinese opera and dance, typically formed by pinching the thumb and middle finger together, with the other fingers extended.

The two of them had quite a good rapport, neither speaking, silently walking towards the other entrance of the mall.\n\nThis mall was already \"dead\"; besides Zhou Ze's and Xu Qinglang's small shops still being open, only a cinema and a buffet restaurant remained.\n\nOf course, due to the broader context, the cinema was likely operating at a loss; on weekdays, few people went there to watch movies, and buying a ticket could easily get you a private screening.\n\nHowever, as it was the Chinese New Year period, most people were on holiday, and it became very common for families to come out together to watch movies, which also added an unusual touch of popularity to this cinema that had been chilly to the core.\n\nHowever, this liveliness, in Zhou Ze's view, seemed more like a dying flicker.\n\nThe grand edifice was crumbling; this could also be considered a case of \"when the nest is overturned, no egg remains unbroken.\"\n\nZhou Ze went to buy tickets and also bought a couple's combo meal. He checked the time, then entered the cinema with Doctor Lin.\n\nBecause they arrived a bit late, and Zhou Ze bought tickets for the nearest showing, all the good seats were gone. Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin could only sit in the front row.\n\nIt wasn't that they couldn't wait, but there was nothing else to browse in this mall. Moreover, *Neon Street Detective 2* was a 2D movie, so sitting in the front row wasn't a big issue.\n\nDoctor Lin hadn't said much on the way. Now, she sat even more quietly beside Zhou Ze, lightly crossing her long legs, and looking up at the screen.\n\nZhou Ze offered the popcorn. Doctor Lin waved her hand, indicating she wouldn't eat.\n\nZhou Ze sighed. For someone who had been an old bachelor in his previous life, how to pursue a girl was truly an unfamiliar subject.\n\nThe movie's jokes were decent. Zhou Ze also chuckled occasionally. Doctor Lin also frequently smiled, but her smiles didn't often make a sound; they were subtle and beautiful.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze, the atmosphere of this movie outing was still somewhat different from what he had expected.\n\nIt was a bit bland, like food without salt.\n\nThe movie ended. Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin walked out side by side. It was only seven in the evening, not late at all, but after leaving the cinema area, the rest of the mall was already pitch black.\n\nDoctor Lin remained silent, simply following along.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to say something, but didn't know how.\n\nHe was the one who had said he wanted to end things and say goodbye yesterday. If he acted too enthusiastically today, would she think he was crazy?\n\n\"To my bookstore...\"\n\n\"To your bookstore to sit for a bit...\"\n\nBoth seemed to be trying to break the current awkwardness, and then they thought of the same thing.\n\nBack at the bookstore, Zhou Ze found that the noodle shop was already closed, and the rolling shutter was uncharacteristically pulled down. He didn't know if Xu Qinglang was still inside.\n\nDoctor Lin chose a magazine and sat down on a chair behind the counter. Zhou Ze also picked up a book, sitting beside her and idly flipping through it.\n\nTwo cups of hot tea were placed on top, with wisps of steam rising.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt he had no right to mock Xu Le anymore, because he realized he had made his first date so artistic and so respectfully formal, which was truly rare!\n\nSo rare that he wished he could slap himself as a reward!\n\n\"Are you not closing now?\" Doctor Lin asked. In fact, her implied meaning was that she wanted to leave; after all, it was night, and if Zhou Ze closed the shop, she could naturally say goodbye.\n\n\"Oh, I usually open for business at night,\" Zhou Ze said. He hadn't caught the implied meaning; he was speaking the truth.\n\nDoctor Lin was momentarily speechless; she could only smile, gently brushing a strand of dark hair from her earlobe, and continued reading the book in her hand.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and two men and one woman walked in.\n\nNone of the three were very old, just around twenty years old. The two men had clearly been drinking; one of them was quite drunk, his entire face was flushed.\n\n\"Boss, do you have water?\" the woman asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the water dispenser on the wall.\n\nThe woman went and poured a few cups of hot water for her friends, then walked to the counter and asked:\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nAs she spoke, the woman took out her phone, seemingly ready to scan and pay.\n\n\"Thirty,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Boss, you can't fleece customers like this during New Year, thirty for three cups of pure water?\" the woman jokingly chided, but she still scanned and paid. She then turned to her two male companions and said, \"Let's rest here for a bit and look at some books.\"\n\nThey were treating this bookstore as a temporary resting place. Zhou Ze charging 30 yuan was somewhat like the minimum charge for entering a teahouse for them, which was understandable.\n\n\"Read books? What kind of books?\"\n\nThe somewhat drunk man shouted loudly at this moment,\n\n\"I want to read ghost stories, horror novels! Does this shop have any?\"\n\nThe man laughed heartily to himself as he spoke.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, took out two collections of horror novels from under the counter, walked up to the man, and handed them to him, at the same time, subtly touching the other person with his finger.\n\nHmm, he's human, not a ghost.\n\nTonight's date was already a big failure.\n\nIf Doctor Lin had to experience another \"Ghost Story Night\" like the one with the five migrant worker brothers last time, that would be something else. Zhou Ze certainly didn't want that.\n\nHe's human, that's good. He looks endearing, even if he's drunk.\n\nAs for the other two, Zhou Ze didn't go and touch them. It wasn't convenient.\n\nThe drunk man sat down. His two friends, one man and one woman, also sat down on the plastic stools. The three of them casually flipped through books while playing on their phones.\n\nAs if to justify, the 30 yuan minimum charge had to be worth it, at least for appearance's sake.\n\n\"What kind of crap are these ghost stories?\"\n\nThe man threw the book, and it landed right next to the water dispenser.\n\nThe woman went to pick up the book and found that because she had spilled some water when pouring, the book's cover and inside pages were already wet.\n\n\"Boss, how much?\"\n\n\"Twenty percent off the marked price.\" Zhou Ze was amused. These three young people actually had quite good manners.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze hoped the drunk man would quickly throw all the books on his shelves and get them all dirty, which would help him clear his inventory.\n\nThe woman somewhat helplessly went to scan and pay, then walked to the drunk man,\n\n\"Let's go, stop acting crazy.\"\n\n\"These aren't ghost stories at all; the person who wrote them definitely hasn't seen a ghost,\" the drunk man insisted stubbornly.\n\nZhou Ze quietly hummed. Hmm, you probably have seen a ghost, right in front of you.\n\nDoctor Lin also put down her book at this moment and looked at the drunk man. Clearly, she found this matter quite interesting.\n\n\"Oh, Brother Liu, you have ghosts at home?\" the man who came in with the drunk man teased at this moment.\n\nThe woman gave him a glance, signaling him not to talk nonsense.\n\n\"Screw you! You're the one with ghosts at home!\"\n\nThe drunk man stood up,\n\n\"Damn it, that ghost only knows how to pick on me during New Year. It leaves everyone else alone. My three brothers, plus my sister, plus my mom and dad, and my grandpa and grandma, it doesn't bother any of them, only me!\"\n\n\"A female ghost?\" the companion man asked again.\n\n\"I wish it were a female ghost! It's a female... dog!\"\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nBoth of the drunk man's companions instinctively burst out laughing, and even Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin lowered their heads and coughed a few times, but it was indeed very funny.\n\nEspecially the drunk man's expression of utter grievance when he said it wasn't a female ghost, but a female... dog.\n\nBaby's heart is bitter¹,\n\nBaby's drunk and wants to talk!\n\n\"Every New Year, a few days before and after, it comes for me! As soon as I fall asleep, it comes, damn it!\"\n\nAlthough the drunk man was acting out, he was still able to control himself, not making him seem scary. Instead, he seemed quite amusing.\n\n\"From seven years ago until now, every New Year, it comes on time, more punctual than my parents giving me New Year's money!\" The man clutched his head, squatting directly on the floor and began to cry. \"Damn it, I can't live like this!\"\n\n\"What exactly happened? That dog, do you know it?\" the companion man asked.\n\n\"That was a dog my family used to keep. It dug out and shredded the money my dad kept under the bed. As a result, my brothers and I killed it and ate its meat.\"\n\n\"That dog must have been resentful, so it came back for revenge,\" the companion man analyzed.\n\n\"Damn it, I just don't know why it only bothers me! When we killed the dog back then, it was me, my brothers, my dad, and my grandpa!\n\nWhen we ate the dog meat, the whole family ate it together, purely as an extra dish for New Year!\n\nThat dog ruined five thousand yuan, it deserved to be eaten!\n\nBut why does it only hate me?\"\n\nThe drunk man almost sobbed: \"I've asked around; my brothers, including my dad and grandpa, none of them have had anything happen! Why does it only target me?\"\n\n\"You're drunk. Let's go, I'll take you home.\" The woman helped the man up, signaling the companion man to help as well.\n\nThis group walked out of the bookstore,\n\nand the previous liveliness suddenly turned desolate.\n\n\"Tell me, why?\" Doctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze, not caring about the truth or falsity, purely chatting after hearing a story. \"Why did that dog only pick on him? Is there something special about him?\"\n\n\"You're very interested in this?\" Zhou Ze asked, somewhat surprised.\n\n\"Mm-hmm.\" Doctor Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Actually, it's very simple. For a dog, if you want to understand its way of thinking, you first have to put yourself in its shoes.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Doctor Lin asked, suppressing a smile. \"It's hard to put oneself in its shoes.\"\n\nIndeed, how can a person put themselves into a dog's mind?\n\n\"A dog's ghost returning for revenge and picking on people is because it holds a grudge,\" Zhou Ze explained. \"This should be the same as with humans.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't it seek revenge on other family members?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's because of that money. The dog was mischievous and shredded a part of it, but another part might have been stolen by this fellow when he was younger.\n\nSo the dog felt it was very unfair. It shredded the money, was punished, was killed, and its meat was eaten. It felt that was justified and deserved.\n\nBut why then,\n\nthat person also stole money and made a portion of the money disappear, but nothing happened to him?\n\nSo it refused to accept it. It didn't go for revenge on other family members; it specifically went for revenge on him.\"\n\nDoctor Lin shook her head, saying with some surprise, \"It was just a drunk story told by a drunk man, but with your analysis, it feels like a real incident.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked to where that group had just sat and found a wallet on the floor. He picked it up and walked to the shop entrance.\n\nJust then, the companion woman jogged over.\n\n\"Excuse me, there's a...\"\n\nZhou Ze handed the wallet over.\n\n\"Thanks!\" The woman bowed to Zhou Ze in gratitude. \"If this guy went home tonight and lost both his wallet and his ID, his family would scold him again.\"\n\n\"No problem.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nThe other party also waved to Zhou Ze, then turned and caught up with her companions ahead.\n\nUnder the moonlight,\n\nas that woman ran,\n\nbeneath her coat,\n\nthere seemed to be a fluffy yellow tail gently wagging...\n\n---\n¹ \"Baby's heart is bitter\" (宝宝心裡苦): A popular internet meme or expression, implying deep grievance or unhappiness, often used humorously.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze felt his eyes must have been playing tricks on him. After just hearing a drunkard’s ghost story about a dog, combined with the dim streetlights, it was perfectly normal to see things.\n\nYes, it must be so.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't Zhang Tianshi of Longhu Mountain. He knew he was still a bit of a \"pushover.\" He couldn't change himself, otherwise, he would have extended his nails to pinch that little loli during the day.\n\nAs for whether the final outcome would be him being pinched to death by the little loli or him still being pinched to death by the little loli…\n\n…it was unknown.\n\nSince he couldn't change himself, he should try his best to be less affected by troublesome things. What he saw, he'd dodge if he could, or cover his eyes if he could.\n\nAnyway, that dog had tormented that man for seven years. Counting the years,\n\nit was time for the seven-year itch.\n\nIf that dog really wanted to harm someone, it would have done so long ago. As for how it would continue to torment him, Zhou Ze didn't care.\n\nThe woman came to his shop, bought water, and paid for the book. She paid very straightforwardly. This was a good turn, and that was enough.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze realized for the first time that there were quite a lot of incredible things in this world. Perhaps it was because he used to be a human, and now he was a ghost; different circles naturally meant different perspectives on the world.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Doctor Lin also walked to the shop entrance at this moment.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, \"I'm very glad I'm not like Spider-Man, without some inexplicable elder relative suddenly popping up to tell me: 'With great power comes great responsibility.'\"\n\nDoctor Lin didn't understand what that meant, but she still said, \"I should go back.\"\n\nIt wasn't early, indeed it was time to go back.\n\n\"Won't you stay a little longer?\"\n\n\"I might have to be on duty tomorrow.\" Doctor Lin tied her scarf.\n\n\"You can change shifts,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's not convenient.\"\n\n\"You don't want to?\"\n\nDoctor Lin frowned slightly. This was the first time she felt Zhou Ze being aggressive. She was a little at a loss.\n\n\"You are my wife,\" Zhou Ze said, looking seriously into Doctor Lin's eyes.\n\nDoctor Lin subtly retreated half a step. \"Yesterday, you said...\"\n\nYesterday's Zhou Ze had just said he wanted to end things, and they would both be free.\n\n\"Yesterday was yesterday.\" Zhou Ze took half a step forward. \"Until I sign the divorce agreement, I am your husband, and you are my wife. So, I want you to stay and accompany me now!\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice grew louder.\n\nDoctor Lin didn't speak, standing still.\n\nA sudden surge of nameless anger rose in Zhou Ze's heart. He reached out a finger and gently pinched Doctor Lin's chin, lifting it.\n\nDoctor Lin looked at him, her gaze clear and calm. Especially her scarlet lips, they were captivating. She was beautiful, truly beautiful. It was the kind of exquisite face combined with an extremely high degree of temperamental harmony, giving a very comfortable feeling.\n\nZhou Ze directly lowered his head and kissed those lips.\n\nHe kissed intensely and roughly, like a wild beast completely unleashing its savagery from within him! And the woman before him was the object of his desire.\n\nDoctor Lin raised her hand, seemingly preparing to slap the man in front of her, but halfway up, her hand slowly dropped.\n\nTears welled up in the corners of her eyes.\n\n\"Why are you crying?\"\n\nTheir lips parted. Zhou Ze lifted his head, looking at Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"You think your crying can make me feel guilty? You think your crying can make me stop? I'm telling you, your crying is useless today. You are my wife, I am your husband! Look at your parents, what kind of people are they? Look at your sister, how she usually looks at me! And look at you, you're noble, you're aloof, you're a goddess, you're untouched by worldly affairs! In the bedroom, you even sleep in a separate bed from me! You're married, you're already a married woman, yet you hypocritically care about your chastity. Don't you even consider if you're still worthy?!\n\nI know, I'm just a dumbass. In your whole family's eyes, I'm just a worthless good-for-nothing and a dumbass!\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed Doctor Lin's neck with one hand, pushed her against the counter, and then directly ripped off Doctor Lin's coat.\n\n\"Today I'm going to teach you, tell you, how a wife should truly behave!\"\n\n\"Xu Le...\" Doctor Lin didn't resist. She just looked at Zhou Ze coldly. \"You... bastard...\"\n\n\"Heh heh,\" Zhou Ze chuckled, completely unconcerned, then took off his own coat and directly pressed Doctor Lin onto the counter.\n\nHe was rough, he was tyrannical. At this moment,\n\nthe tinder was already laid, needing only a spark to burst into flames!\n\nZhou Ze was that fire!\n\nShe smelled so good, her skin was so soft, her body so plump. Everything about her was so beautiful, so enchanting.\n\nBut at this very moment, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped his movements, staggering back a few steps.\n\nIn front of him, Doctor Lin lay on the counter, her top disheveled, while Zhou Ze himself was panting heavily.\n\nNo,\n\nhow did it turn out like this?\n\nDoctor Lin was still lying on the counter, her eyes still open, still not resisting.\n\nShe felt guilty towards Xu Le. She was a very independent and strong woman, but her social environment and the family education she received from childhood had always left her conflicted.\n\nHer parents threatened to die, hoping for grandchildren early, forcing her to agree to marry Xu Le. Yet, she clung to her bottom line, with another man in her heart—even though that man had died in a car accident half a year ago, even though that man might have forgotten her long ago, or perhaps didn't even know there was a woman like her who had been secretly following him for several years after her internship ended.\n\nTo describe it in the critical style often used in middle school textbooks: Doctor Lin chose to submit to feudal etiquette in her life, yet she was unwilling to live like that forever, still holding onto her own principles and resistance in her heart.\n\nThis was also why, even though she was a million times unwilling, Lin Wanqiu still didn't resist and allowed Zhou Ze to do as he pleased just now;\n\nShe felt she had no reason to resist; Zhou Ze was her husband, and she knew her actions since marriage had been unfair to her husband and to this marriage.\n\nShe didn't accept, she didn't agree,\n\nbut she didn't resist.\n\n\"Put on your clothes, put your clothes on properly!\" Zhou Ze roared at Lin Wanqiu, who was still lying on the counter.\n\nLin Wanqiu was stunned for a moment, then stood upright, looking at Zhou Ze with some disbelief. Just now, she had already resigned herself to fate.\n\n\"I haven't even had a chance to do anything to you yet, don't look like you've just been raped. Put on your clothes,\n\nnow,\n\nimmediately,\n\nat once,\n\nand then get out!\"\n\nDoctor Lin silently put on her clothes, then adjusted her collar in the mirror. Her face was expressionless. After everything was tidied, she poured Zhou Ze a fresh cup of hot water and placed it on the counter. Then, without even glancing at Zhou Ze, she walked straight out of the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze slumped to the ground, feeling bewildered and confused.\n\nOn his lips and palms, there seemed to be lingering warmth from her. He didn't know why he had stopped, nor did he understand why he hadn't continued.\n\nIt felt so good,\n\nhe longed for it so much,\n\nhe was so intoxicated,\n\nbut for some reason, he felt something was wrong, as if this wasn't the feeling he wanted.\n\nHe was just about to sleep with her,\n\nand she had agreed,\n\nbut that scene just now was completely different from what he desired.\n\nZhou Ze stumbled to his feet. He picked up the teacup, took a sip, and then spat out the hot water. The water was scalding, without any cold water mixed in to temper it.\n\nHe dropped the cup, letting the water wet the floor. Zhou Ze looked around, recalling his actions just now, reminiscing about the words he had just spoken.\n\nHis fists clenched, then loosened, only to clench tightly again.\n\nHe went to the bathroom, turned on the faucet in the sink, and directly put his head under the running water, splashing it over himself.\n\nHe needed to calm down, to find peace.\n\nNot just to quell the fiery urge in his body, but also the one in his heart.\n\nEnduring the cold water of winter was not something ordinary people could bear. Zhou Ze lifted his head, feeling a dizzy spell.\n\nHe looked at the mirror in front of him.\n\nIn the mirror, his own reflection stared back.\n\nZhou Ze gripped the edge of the sink's tiles tightly with both hands, panting continuously. Then, he slowly raised his head again, as if talking to himself, saying:\n\n\"It's you!\n\n\"It's you, you damned bastard, you worthless good-for-nothing! You're influencing me, you're trying to control me,\n\nyou trash, scum, mutt!\"\n\nZhou Ze cursed at his reflection in the mirror.\n\nYes,\n\nthat wasn't him. His behavior just now was too abnormal. That sudden, nameless anger, that unreasoned confusion, that inexplicable impulse...\n\n...it was definitely not just youthful vigor.\n\nJust now, at that very moment,\n\na guy he thought had long since gone to hell, no longer existing in this world...\n\n...he had influenced him.\n\nHe hadn't left,\n\nhe was still hiding around him,\n\nand perhaps...\n\n...he was hiding inside his body!\n\nHe was a good-for-nothing, he was weak. He had endured disdain throughout his life, not daring to resist, nor having the courage to raise his head. But after death, he was curled up in a corner, yet thinking of using someone else's hand to take the most simple and brutal revenge on his wife!\n\nUsing another person's strength to get revenge on his wife.\n\n\"I used to feel sorry for you, even felt a little bit that I owed you,\" Zhou Ze murmured to himself. \"Now I understand. Those who are pitiable must have something hateful about them. You lived your previous life that way; one can only say you deserved it!\"\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his fist and punched the mirror directly.\n\nThe mirror shattered.\n\nZhou Ze's hand was also bleeding profusely, the fresh blood beginning to drip into the sink.\n\nOn the broken shards of the mirror,\n\nZhou Ze's face was still reflected.\n\nNo,\n\nit was Xu Le's face.\n\nZhou Ze stood there motionless.\n\nThe person in the mirror also didn't move.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\na sinister glint appeared in the eyes of the person in the mirror, who then spoke:\n\n\"Oh, you found me.\"",

    "content": "\"You are... courting death.\"\n\nA black luster emerged from the depths of Zhou Ze's eyes. At this moment, he was furious.\n\nYes, he had taken over like a cuckoo in a magpie's nest*,\n\nBut,\n\nSo what!\n\nI'm going to continue living in your body, can you stop me?\n\nYour revenge,\n\nwas merely to suddenly provoke me into forcing myself on your wife?\n\nIs that all you amount to?\n\nZhou Ze spread open his right hand. Black nails slowly grew out, and wisps of black mist swirled around them.\n\nOften, the true solution to a problem depends on your position, that is, your stance.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, there was no way to distinguish right from wrong. He wanted to live; as long as all actions were based on this premise, they were correct. Otherwise, everything would lose its meaning.\n\nIf meaning was lost, was there any need for right or wrong to exist?\n\n\"No matter where you hide, I will drag you out, even if... you're hiding inside this body!\"\n\nZhou Ze's face began to contort, and his nails started digging into his chest.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nExcruciating pain accompanied uncontrollable spasms. Zhou Ze trembled all over, falling directly to his knees.\n\nHe opened his mouth,\n\nlooking somewhat dazed,\n\nNot there,\n\nCompletely not there!\n\nWhy,\n\nHe had just verified it at the risk of almost shattering his own soul: within this body, there was only his, Zhou Ze's, sole soul. Xu Le was simply not there!\n\nZhou Ze crawled back to his feet, looking at his own reflection in the shattered mirror. This time, he waited a long time, but the person in the mirror showed no change whatsoever.\n\nXu Le had long ceased to exist.\n\nSo, everything I had done to Doctor Lin earlier was driven by my true nature?\n\nNo,\n\nThat's impossible,\n\nImpossible!\n\nIt couldn't be like this.\n\nFor the first time, Zhou Ze felt that the person in the mirror was so unfamiliar. It wasn't because he had changed bodies or appearance, but because his inner self, his soul, seemed to be completely different from his original self-perception.\n\nWhich was the true self, the body or the soul?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, many great poets and philosophers, both Chinese and foreign, had actually given a similar answer: the flesh would change and decay, but the soul could endure forever.\n\nIt could be noble, it could be remembered, it could shine brightly throughout the river of history.\n\nZhou Ze also believed that he was still Zhou Ze, still his original self. Now, it was merely that his body had changed, but he still considered himself Zhou Ze.\n\nNow,\n\nhe began to feel fear,\n\nbecause since Xu Le's soul had long ceased to exist,\n\nthis meant that,\n\nwhat had changed... was himself?\n\n............\n\n\"Go to sleep, my dear.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll take our daughter to rest first. You should also rest once you're done with your work.\"\n\n\"Alright, after I've revised this treatment plan.\"\n\nWang Ke gently stretched his neck and yawned. He was indeed very sleepy, but the work at hand had to be finished. Though only just over thirty, many white hairs had already appeared on his head.\n\nMen at this age were the most awkward: if they didn't strive, it was too early to retire; if they did strive, their bodies were already starting to decline.\n\n\"Ding ding ding... ding ding ding...\"\n\nWang Ke frowned slightly. So late, and someone was still visiting?\n\nHe walked to the entrance, glanced at the man in the black jacket standing outside on the video feed, and asked, \"May I ask, who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm looking for Wang Ke. A friend referred me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, if it's urgent, you can make an appointment with my assistant. I usually at home...\"\n\n\"Zhou Ze referred me.\" The man outside said.\n\nHearing that name, Wang Ke paused, then opened the door.\n\nThe other party looked somewhat young, perhaps only twenty-five.\n\n\"Come in.\" Wang Ke gestured for him to enter, and personally brewed him a cup of tea, placing it on the coffee table.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa, looking at his old friend.\n\nHe hadn't changed at all; he was still striving in his profession. As children who grew up together in the orphanage, they had been close since childhood. And in the old director's eyes, these two were considered the most promising among the children who had left the orphanage in recent years.\n\nZhou Ze, at a young age, was already a deputy director at a hospital, while Wang Ke had his own psychological clinic, not a small storefront in a cramped location, but one located beside South Street in the city center, which was the heart of Tongcheng for its residents.\n\nEven this villa was definitely not something an ordinary person could afford.\n\n\"You know Zhou Ze?\" Wang Ke asked first.\n\n\"Yes, he's been dead for half a year.\" Zhou Ze replied, then picked up the teacup and took a sip. He still liked Maojian tea; his taste hadn't changed.\n\n\"Why are you looking for me?\"\n\n\"To see a doctor.\"\n\n\"To see a doctor?\" Wang Ke coughed. \"You can make an appointment.\"\n\n\"It's urgent.\" Zhou Ze looked into Wang Ke's eyes. \"Very urgent.\"\n\nWang Ke fell silent, then smiled, nodded, stood up, and said, \"Please come with me to the study.\"\n\nRegardless of whether the other party's sudden visit was impolite or their request abrupt, since they claimed to be Zhou Ze's friend, Wang Ke had no reason or way to refuse.\n\nZhou Ze sat properly in Wang Ke's study for a while. Wang Ke entered wearing a set of white clothes, indicating his seriousness.\n\n\"Tell me about your situation.\" Wang Ke twirled the pen in his hand. It was a dark gold pen, quite striking under the study's light.\n\nZhou Ze slowly shook his head. \"Don't hypnotize me, not even with shallow hypnosis.\"\n\nWang Ke nodded and put down the pen.\n\n\"I might have some... dissociative identity disorder.\" Zhou Ze organized his words.\n\n\"Be more specific.\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"I feel that, inside my body, another person's personality exists. More precisely, at certain moments, that person's disposition will suddenly influence my actions, and I can clearly sense that those are absolutely not things I should be doing.\n\nI have always been... a very disciplined person.\"\n\n\"Symptoms of dissociative identity disorder?\" Wang Ke narrowed his eyes. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\"Recently.\"\n\n\"Alright, on this paper, draw your second personality. Just based on your feelings, draw what he looks like, even if you've never seen his true appearance.\"\n\nWang Ke handed a blank sheet of paper and the pen to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"My second personality?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\n\"But... strictly speaking, I am the second personality.\" Zhou Ze pointed to himself. \"The one causing trouble now should be the original personality of this body.\"\n\nWang Ke's gaze sharpened, and he began to re-examine Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You mean, your current state is the second personality?\"\n\n\"According to your theory, yes, that should be it.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe original owner of this body was Xu Le, and Zhou Ze was an outsider. Therefore, Zhou Ze was the second personality.\n\n\"You've already killed him?\" Wang Ke asked with interest. He seemed... somewhat excited.\n\n\"More or less, and I'm certain he's gone.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then what you did actually counts as murder.\" Wang Ke reminded him. \"Although legally, this kind of action cannot be judged or characterized, I still have to sit here and condemn you.\"\n\n\"And after the condemnation?\"\n\n\"You came to me because you want to find a way to completely get rid of the first personality's influence on you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWang Ke started twirling his pen again. This time, it wasn't for hypnosis, but because he was thinking.\n\n\"I don't know if I should help you, because from my perspective, you killed an originally existing 'person,' and if I help you, I would be helping you destroy evidence. I would become an accomplice.\"\n\n\"Help me.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I need to consider it.\" Wang Ke mused.\n\n\"No need to consider, help me.\" Zhou Ze urged, and then, Zhou Ze added, \"Er Dan Ge.\"\n\nWhen the name \"Er Dan Ge\" was uttered, Wang Ke's expression suddenly changed. He said, somewhat surprised, \"Zhou Ze even told you that?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nWang Ke looked up, somewhat conflicted, but still gritted his teeth and picked up his pen to write out a prescription:\n\n\"I'll prescribe you some medication. These drugs are actually just auxiliary; they can help stabilize your emotions and aid your sleep.\"\n\n\"Then there's no need to prescribe them.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The most important step is for you to change your environment.\" Wang Ke ignored Zhou Ze's previous words and, having finished writing the prescription, continued, \"You need to detach from the social connections of your first personality's original life and reconstruct your own social connections.\n\nMany people believe that a person's thoughts reside only in the soul, although whether souls exist in this world, that is, whether ghosts exist, is still unknown.\n\nBut this statement itself is inaccurate. In fact, our bodies, our muscles, our eyes, and many, many other parts and organs can all store a person's 'soul.' This 'soul' is different from the soul in the broader sense.\n\nIt refers to things like 'muscle memory' created by athletes through countless repetitions of training, as well as 'psychological suggestion,' and so on. You can understand it as a kind of inertia.\n\nYou are the second personality; you killed the first personality,\n\nbut this body, after all, existed and operated under the first personality for far too long. It has its own inertia, its own memories. Sometimes, the reason you suddenly make inexplicable choices, leaving yourself shocked and bewildered afterward, creating the illusion that the first personality still exists and is causing trouble,\n\nis precisely for this reason.\n\nFirst, cut off all your current social networks, build your own social circle, and allow this body to start readapting to you, canceling out the previous inertia. The problem will then be solved.\n\nActually, your current situation isn't severe. Your thought process is very clear. Overcoming it is just a matter of time.\" Wang Ke smiled.\n\nAt this moment, someone knocked on the study door.\n\n\"Darling, do we have guests?\"\n\n\"Yes, could you pour two more coffees for me?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of Doctor Lin, thought of his parents-in-law, thought of that sister-in-law,\n\nIndeed,\n\nAt first, he had rejected that person's social connections, even wanting to sever them long ago.\n\nBut he didn't know when it started,\n\nthe fact that she wouldn't sleep with him anyway,\n\nhad instead become his obsession?\n\n\"How long will it take to sever the connections?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not long at all.\" Wang Ke shrugged, looking relaxed. \"I've been observing you since you walked in. The feeling you give me, how should I put it?\n\nYou are the second personality, but I think you're the most thorough case I've seen where the second personality completely eliminated the first personality.\n\nIt's like... 'borrowing a corpse to return a soul'** in ancient supernatural tales. Very straightforward, very neat, one could even use the word 'perfect' to describe it.\n\nNow, you can understand it as a slight side effect from taking a medication. With your own immunity, you can completely overcome it. Perhaps, it'll take two or three months.\n\nAfter that, you can pick up your old social connections again, and there won't be any problems.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\n\"Coffee's here.\"\n\nThe study door was pushed open, and a woman entered, carrying two cups of coffee, which she placed on the desk.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the woman, and the woman also looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze's mind suddenly stirred, and the woman's expression also abruptly changed.\n\n\"What, do you two know each other?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"Yes, he's Doctor Lin's husband, Xu Le.\" The woman replied.\n\n\"Huh?\" Wang Ke stood up, somewhat surprised,\n\nand actively approached Zhou Ze to shake his hand and express gratitude.\n\nBefore, the man in front of him was a patient introduced by his deceased childhood friend. Now, he was also his daughter's savior, so their relationship naturally became closer.\n\nZhou Ze dealt with it perfunctorily, his mind actually wondering whether he should remind his childhood friend, who was completely absorbed in his career, that his wife was recently very addicted to the indescribable 'hair perming' activities?***\n\nHe thought about it and decided it was better to remind him anonymously after leaving. Although the two of them, after entering the workforce, had both dedicated themselves to their careers due to knowing each other's personalities, and thus did not disturb each other.\n\nTheir friendship and childhood memories hadn't changed, but they had never had the habit of casually getting together to drink, have tea, or chat. In fact, if not for this somewhat tricky problem, Zhou Ze wouldn't have come to Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke had gotten married, Zhou Ze didn't know; he had children, Zhou Ze didn't know either. But when help was needed, if he mentioned his name, the other party would surely agree.\n\nWang Ke and his wife escorted Zhou Ze out of the house. Zhou Ze declined Wang Ke's offer to drive him back.\n\n\"Darling, what did he come to see you about?\"\n\n\"To see a doctor.\" Wang Ke replied. \"You said he runs a bookstore?\"\n\n\"Yes, a bookstore like a tea salon.\"\n\n\"Alright then, I'll go check it out if I get a chance.\"\n\n............\n\nZhou Ze had just exited the villa's premises,\n\nwhen he suddenly felt something, stopped, turned around, and looked at the villa behind him.\n\nOn the villa's balcony,\n\nstood a little loli****,\n\nShe was holding her white bear stuffed animal, wearing red pajamas, and standing outside in the wind.\n\nHer hair fluttered, her skirt billowed, yet she stood unmoving, seemingly oblivious,\n\nonly her eyes,\n\nwere fixed on him.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze's expression was grim, and his body felt tense,\n\nbut gradually, the tension receded. The pressure of Xu Le's matter on his mind was also relieved by the recent conversation, and Zhou Ze felt very relaxed.\n\nHowever, what troubled Zhou Ze was that,\n\nit seemed he not only had to warn his childhood friend about his wife's problem,\n\nbut his daughter,\n\nalso seemed to have a problem.\n\nSilently, Zhou Ze felt a pang of sympathy for his childhood friend.\n\nWhat sins had he committed in his previous life to have such a 'happy and harmonious' family?\n\nAt this thought, a bitter smile appeared at the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nThe next moment, facing the little loli's gaze from the distant balcony,\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand,\n\nand waved in that direction:\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\n---\n*   Literally 'magpie's nest, dove's abode,' an idiom describing someone who occupies another's place or property without right.\n**  Literally 'borrow a corpse to return a soul,' a supernatural concept where a soul enters and revives a dead body.\n*** Literally 'hair perming' or 'getting a perm.' In this context, with 'indescribable,' it implies illicit or scandalous activities, possibly an affair.\n**** A Japanese loanword (loli) used in Chinese to refer to a cute, young girl, often implying a specific aesthetic or character type in fiction.",

    "content": "From the villa district, Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to hail a taxi, instead planning to walk alone on the night road.\n\nWang Ke said his side had no major issues, only needing to sever Xu Le's previous social network. Of course, it was already pretty much severed now.\n\nGiven how he'd treated Doctor Lin, he figured Doctor Lin wouldn't pay him any mind for a while. As for his in-laws' home, he hadn't returned for several days.\n\nThe only tricky thing was probably his bookstore; after all, the money to open it had come from his in-laws.\n\nLet things be for now. He also needed to calm down during this period.\n\nAhead was a pedestrian bridge. Zhou Ze walked up, sat down on a step, took out his phone, and casually scrolled through it.\n\nCoincidentally, Zhou Ze tapped on that live streaming app. Xu Le had followed many game and 'looks' category streamers during his life, but Zhou Ze wasn't very interested in any of them. Scrolling down, Zhou Ze saw that the old Taoist streamer he'd watched last time still hadn't started broadcasting.\n\nNot broadcasting for so long, he probably truly wasn't going to stream anymore.\n\nThe streaming industry seemed easy, making money while sitting at home, but the pressure was also immense. Let alone not broadcasting for one or two months, even a few days without broadcasting could render one a \"faded glory of yesterday\"<sup>1</sup>.\n\nHowever, it was at this moment that Zhou Ze discovered an unread message in his account. Opening it, he found it was actually a private message from the old Taoist, sent the day before yesterday.\n\n\"This humble Taoist has come to Tongcheng. Dear, want to meet up?\"\n\nBelow it, the old Taoist's phone number was attached.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. Besides the message, the old Taoist had also included many heart emojis. Immediately, Zhou Ze flipped through Xu Le's account information.\n\nFemale account,\n\nAnd the address was Tongcheng.\n\nXu Le must have tried streaming before, as she still had her own live stream room, but her popularity was dismal.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood where this strange feeling came from. The old Taoist's message clearly carried the intention of \"sleeping with fans\"<sup>2</sup>. He had come to Tongcheng for some business, then sought out his fans in Tongcheng, \"casting a wide net\" to \"reel in a catch\"<sup>3</sup>.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't interested in this old Taoist; what he was interested in was the young man who had appeared in the old Taoist's videos and had difficulty drinking congee.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze still replied with a message: his own number.\n\nStanding up, stretching, Zhou Ze prepared to leave. He was starting to miss his freezer.\n\nHowever, his phone rang at that moment.\n\nPicking up the phone, the caller ID showed a number from Rongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze answered the call.\n\n\"Hello, benefactor, where are you?!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's voice was loud, as if he were shouting into the phone's speaker. There seemed to be train sounds around him.\n\n\"Where are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWas that old Taoist very idle? Didn't he have many fans? How could he reply to his messages so quickly every time?\n\nCould it be that the allure of female fans was indeed very appealing?\n\n\"Huh...\" The old Taoist was startled, falling silent for a moment. He hadn't expected the fan he planned to meet to be a man!\n\nA big... \"diao\" cute girl!<sup>4</sup>\n\nHeartbroken,\n\nDisappointed,\n\nDejected!\n\nBut the old Taoist immediately changed his tone, crying out hoarsely:\n\n\"Big brother, I'm starving! Begging for three to five bottles<sup>5</sup>, give me something to eat!\"\n\n………………\n\nTaking a taxi there, Zhou Ze found the old Taoist in a lumpy spot under a railway bridge. The old Taoist was wearing a dirty Taoist robe, his hair was disheveled, and his face had a few bruises, looking exactly like a refugee. He had been lying on a plastic sheet below.\n\nOn a nearby street, there was a restaurant called \"Dragon Pond Home-Style Cuisine.\" Zhou Ze ordered him two bowls of noodles, a plate of Kung Pao Chicken, and a plate of small mixed fish. The old Taoist ate with great gusto.\n\n\"Brother, you're really something!\" The old Taoist finished one bowl of noodles, finally starting to slow down. Then he told the boss he wanted a pot of rice wine warmed up, and immediately smiled apologetically at Zhou Ze. He didn't have much money in his pocket; Zhou Ze would definitely be paying for this meal in the end.\n\n\"How did you end up like this, old man?\" A glass of water was in front of Zhou Ze. He hadn't touched any of the dishes on the table.\n\n\"Sigh, don't even mention it.\" The old Taoist took a sip of noodle soup, smacking his lips. \"I've just been down on my luck lately. Originally, I came to Tongcheng with a film crew for location scouting.\"\n\n\"Changed professions?\"\n\n\"Sort of. I haven't wanted to stream lately.\" The old Taoist sighed. \"People, they always need to have some dreams, don't they?\"\n\n\"True.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This humble Taoist's dream for the future is to star in a *Mr. Zombie* film, whether it's three, four, five, or six, seven, eight.\" When talking about dreams, the old Taoist's entire demeanor seemed to shift slightly.\n\n\"And you ended up like this in a film crew?\" Zhou Ze asked, somewhat curious.\n\n\"Heh heh, originally, I was considered a minor supporting actor in the crew, but who knew fate would play such tricks on me?\"\n\nThe wine arrived,\n\nThe old Taoist first poured a cup for Zhou Ze, then filled his own, took a small sip, and narrowed his eyes:\n\n\"Tsk tsk tsk, beautiful, beautiful.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his plain water and took another sip.\n\n\"That assistant director was a jerk. He wanted to 'unspoken rule'<sup>6</sup> that young actress. That girl probably wasn't even eighteen. Sigh, the girl cried, unwilling;\n\nThis humble Taoist happened to run into it, went up and beat that assistant director up.\"\n\nThe old Taoist reached out and patted his chest, saying:\n\n\"Making money is making money, getting famous is getting famous, but no matter what we do, we can't go against our conscience, right?\n\nBrother, tell me, isn't that the truth?\"\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze responded. \"So you got fired?\"\n\n\"Not yet. He didn't dare use that as an excuse.\" The old Taoist continued smiling, his lips peeled back. \"This humble Taoist beat him up, and quite a few people knew about it. He didn't dare deal with me like that, or his own reputation would be completely ruined.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then, then the young actress I saved that night, the very next night, she voluntarily walked into the assistant director's room and didn't come out all night.\"\n\nAs the old Taoist said these words, he seemed a bit disheartened. \"They're all pitiable people, all people who have it tough.\"\n\n\"And then what?\"\n\n\"Then the young actress said I 'ate her tofu'<sup>7</sup>, that I molested her. The assistant director didn't show up, and the main director kicked me out of the crew.\" The old Taoist was still smiling, only his smile contained some bitterness.\n\n\"Drink up.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Come on, let's have one!\" The old Taoist raised his wine cup. Seeing Zhou Ze was holding plain water, he immediately said, \"Looking down on your brother, are we? Let's drink a cup of wine. Your brother's in trouble today, indebted to you, my brother, for your care. We'll meet again somewhere down the road<sup>8</sup>. One day, when your brother has money, I'll pay you back.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm allergic to alcohol.\"\n\n\"Alright then, tea instead of wine!\"\n\nThe two clinked cups, and the old Taoist drained his.\n\nLife's grievances, wasted time, indignation, all sorts of inequalities,\n\nAll within a single cup of wine.\n\n\"You're out of money?\" Zhou Ze asked. Actually, this question didn't need to be asked.\n\n\"Mm.\" The old Taoist said, then revealed an expectant look, hoping Zhou Ze would lend him some money. He originally had some money saved, but it had all been given out as aid at the beginning of the month. Now his job was gone, which was why he suddenly became short on funds.\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist suddenly felt a sense of familiarity with this person's way of chatting.\n\nWhat the f*ck<sup>9</sup>\n\n, you just said \"Oh,\"\n\nAnd then you asked if I had money, why?\n\nZhou Ze got up, paid the bill, and then prepared to leave. Treating the old Taoist to a meal was purely because Zhou Ze was a bit bored that night and wanted to find someone to talk to.\n\nHe could have gone back to find Xu Qinglang, but Xu Qinglang had closed early that night, with the rolling door pulled down, so he couldn't be found.\n\nNow, he was tired and wanted to go back and rest.\n\n\"Brother, you run a bookstore?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Running a bookstore doesn't make money, does it?\" The old Taoist spread his palm, pinching his fingers together as if calculating.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"This humble Taoist believes that actually, running an underworld shop<sup>10</sup> makes money.\" The old Taoist saw that Zhou Ze didn't seem very interested in his \"calculations.\" Alright then, this person in front of him was someone born under the red flag who completely ignored feudal superstitions. The old Taoist then put away his thoughts.\n\n\"Underworld shop?\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Don't want to open one.\"\n\nHe himself was a ghost; why would he open an underworld shop?\n\n\"To be honest, this old Taoist used to run an underworld shop in Rongcheng.\" The old Taoist pulled out a stack of money from his pocket—hell money<sup>11</sup>. \"Brother, thank you for this meal today. I don't have much to give you, so take this stack of hell money first. Don't rush to curse me; of course, this money can't be spent, but it has yin virtue<sup>12</sup> on it. Just carry it with you, don't be afraid of bad luck, it can bring you some good fortune.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't reach out for the money,\n\nWho'd be crazy enough to take a stack of hell money and carry it on them?\n\n\"Brother, don't disbelieve me.\" The old Taoist, seeing Zhou Ze didn't want it, grew a bit anxious. He directly pulled open his Taoist robe, pointed to a wound on his right chest, and said, \"Back then, it was a stack of hell money that saved my life!\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, I'll take it.\"\n\nZhou Ze was too lazy to watch a grown man expose his chest in front of him, so he simply reached out and took the hell money.\n\n\"I remember seeing someone else in your videos, in the underworld shop. That person had great difficulty drinking congee.\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, him? He's an employee I hired. Lazy as death, all he does all day is bask in the sun, doesn't do a thing. I scold him every day, telling him he can't be so lazy at such a young age.\"\n\n\"Oh, does he have anorexia?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Sort of.\" Speaking of that person, the old Taoist seemed a bit disappointed. \"Why, is he very handsome?\"\n\n\"No, I just felt a bit of kinship.\"\n\n\"Kinship my ass<sup>13</sup>.\" The old Taoist laughed as if he'd heard a funny joke.\n\nYou feel kinship with a ghost, are you perhaps a ghost too?\n\nHahahahahahaha,\n\nThis humble Taoist is dying of laughter!\n\nThe two walked out of the restaurant together. Zhou Ze offered the old Taoist a cigarette. A supermarket next door was still open, with a small fruit stall set up outside its entrance.\n\n\"You stand here and don't move. I'll go buy you some oranges.\" The old Taoist chuckled, joking.\n\n\"I'll just eat two; the rest are yours.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Huh?\" The old Taoist thought Zhou Ze was a bit \"out\" and didn't understand his meme. He found it a bit uninteresting. This bookstore owner must be a bookworm.\n\nZhou Ze also didn't offer an explanation.\n\nIn reality, \"I'll go buy some oranges; you just stand here and don't move\" was a line spoken by the father to his son in Zhu Ziqing's *The Back View*<sup>14</sup>.\n\nAnd what Zhou Ze said was a line spoken by the grandfather to his grandson in *Camel Xiangzi*<sup>15</sup>.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze reached out and patted the old Taoist on the shoulder. \"I'm leaving. Take care.\"\n\nJust as the old Taoist was about to say something,\n\nHe suddenly clutched his crotch,\n\nAnd then a smell of burning hair wafted out,\n\n\"Mother, it's scalding this humble Taoist to death!\"\n***\n<sup>1</sup> \"Faded glory of yesterday\" (明日黃花 - mìngrì huánghuā): Literally \"chrysanthemum of tomorrow,\" meaning something that has lost its freshness or appeal; past its prime.\n<sup>2</sup> \"Sleeping with fans\" (艹粉 - cào fěn): A slang term for streamers/celebrities engaging in sexual relations with their fans.\n<sup>3</sup> \"Casting a wide net' to 'reel in a catch'\" (廣撒網，撈一把 - guǎng sā wǎng, lāo yī bǎ): A common idiom meaning to widely solicit or search in hopes of gaining something.\n<sup>4</sup> \"A big...

away。」\n\n冥冥之中，\n\n或許有一種感應，\n\n就比如周澤看老道的直播視頻時，看見視頻里坐在冥店櫃檯後艱難喝粥的年輕男子，產生了一種莫名地感觸，\n\n那不僅僅是厭食症那麼簡單，\n\n其實，\n\n他們本是一類人。\n\n在這個世界上，他不是絕對的唯一和單獨的另類。\n\n正如地獄中，無面女所不甘怒吼的那樣：\n\n「你怎麼也能離開？」\n\n這意味著，\n\n不僅僅是周澤，之前也曾有人在無面女面前離開過。\n\n再加上周澤出車禍救治的黑指甲老者，\n\n這個世界，\n\n真的沒有想像中那般平靜。\n\n………………\n\n打車回到書店時，已經是凌晨一點了，周澤將衛生間地上的玻璃碎片收拾了一下，然後又燒了幾壺水用毛巾勉強擦拭了身體。\n\n他決定明天就讓人來安裝一個噴灑好方便自己洗澡，對於一個有著輕度潔癖的人來說，不能洗澡，絕對是一種酷刑。\n\n回到二樓，設置了溫度，周澤躺入了其中，閉上眼，準備告別今日的疲憊以及今日的一切紛紛擾擾。\n\n這一覺，睡得很踏實，也很安穩。\n\n一夜無事，\n\n第二天早上醒來時，從冰櫃裡出來的周澤先去洗漱，隨後打開了店門，看了一眼隔壁。\n\n隔壁今日又關著門。\n\n林醫生那邊暫時不能聯繫了，\n\n老婆沒了，\n\n現在連他也沒了，\n\n周澤猛地搖搖頭，該死，自己怎麼會產生這種念頭？\n\n徐樂餘毒害人啊，\n\n對，\n\n肯定是這樣。\n\n從昨晚到現在就沒吃過東西，周澤只能拿出手機點了一份外賣，備註讓店家多送一些醋。\n\n等了大概二十分鐘，一個穿著黃色外賣服的小哥就開著電瓶車來了，對方直接推開店門走了進來，將外賣遞給了坐在櫃檯後看著書的周澤。\n\n「謝謝，真不容易，大過年的還要送外賣。」周澤客氣道。\n\n「你也不容易，大過年地還得吃外賣。」外賣小哥直接回復道。\n\n「…………」周澤。\n\n周澤感覺自己「膝蓋中了一箭」³，抬頭特意看了一眼面前的外賣小哥，對方很年輕，看起來也就二十歲出頭的樣子。\n\n「你這兒是書店？」外賣小哥看了一眼店裡的環境，「可以坐下來看書的那種？多少錢？」\n\n「看著給。」周澤打開了外賣包裝袋。\n\n「得嘞。」\n\n外賣小哥在塑料板凳上坐了下來，找了一本《斗破蒼穹》看了起來，看得津津有味得很。\n\n周澤則是將店家送的醋一口飲盡，似乎是因為最近被許清朗家變態級別的酸梅汁給鍛鍊出來了，周澤感覺這普通的醋，沒啥感覺。\n\n緊接著，又是一通狼吞虎咽，吃到一半時，噁心反胃感就開始襲來。\n\n周澤雙手掐著自己的脖子，強行讓自己不吐出來，終於，一番可怕的僵持之後，噁心感開始慢慢地褪去，周澤擦了擦嘴角，而後開始重重地咳嗽起來。\n\n「哥，慢點吃，您這吃相用我奶奶的話來說，就像是餓死鬼投胎一樣。」\n\n外賣小哥一邊看著書一邊說道。\n\n周澤瞪了對方一眼，乾脆坐在椅子上喘著氣，他需要緩緩。\n\n該死的許清朗，\n\n怎麼還不開門！\n\n周澤決定，如果對方到下午時還不開門的話，自己只能去砸門進去找一找剩下的酸梅汁兒或者苦瓜汁兒了，不然這飯還真的吃不下去。\n\n外賣小哥似乎停止接單了，坐在那裡看了一個小時的小說。\n\n「咦，怎麼有股子焦煤味？」外賣小哥忽然嗅了嗅鼻子，然後走出了書店外。\n\n周澤沒當一回事兒，對方可能是想著看會兒書不願意給錢，無所謂了。\n\n這家書店，賺錢還真是「隨緣」⁴。\n\n但緊接著，剛剛走到外面的外賣小哥馬上張開了嘴，喊道：\n\n「哇，著火了。」\n\n周澤這才警醒，馬上也走出了店鋪，抬頭一看，目光當即一凝，上面大廈的第四層，滾滾濃煙正在從裡面冒出來。\n\n這是，\n\n電影院的位置！\n\n原本的商業中心，現在還能有點人氣的，也就是那家電影院了，而且這陣子因為是過年檔的原因，來這裡看電影的人很多。\n\n「走，去救人。」外賣小哥直接向那邊奔跑過去。\n\n周澤站在那裡猶豫了十秒，火情肯定很大，但絕對燒不到自己的書店，他在克制著自己內心深處想要去救人的本能。\n\n在以前，他記不清楚自己多少次趕赴災禍現場的一線去參加搶救了，但恰巧在最近，他打算改掉這個壞毛病。\n\n不過，經過了激烈的思想掙扎之後，周澤還是跟著一起跑了過去。\n\n自己，\n\n還是「賤唄」⁵！\n\n從一樓到三樓的樓梯處，有很多人往下跑，周澤則是往上跑。\n\n雖然這個商業中心是「廢」了，但它位於市區之中，消防車應該很快就能趕來。\n\n上午看電影的人沒有下午多，但人數也很可觀，當周澤沿著樓梯跑到了第四層時，看見裡面的濃煙更大了許多，而且火焰燃燒得很詭異，哪怕是以外失火，也不可能燒得這麼誇張！\n\n只是這個時候不是分析起因的時候，在濃煙之中，周澤看見臉上被熏得黑黑的外賣小哥背著一個老太婆跑了出來。\n\n對方看了一眼周澤，笑了笑，露出了一口白牙，然後扭過頭再度跑向了觀影區繼續救人。\n\n火勢並沒有完全蔓延出來，但在觀影區那邊，火勢很是誇張。\n\n周澤沒有再猶豫，既然已經來了，總得做點什麼，他當即也跑入了濃煙之中。\n\n「咳咳…………咳咳…………」\n\n沒有任何的防護措施，倉促地進來是一件很傻的行為，很容易救不到人反而把自己給交代在裡頭。\n\n所以周澤清楚自己時間有限，如果看到哪個需要幫助的人，把他帶出來就好了，其餘的事情，他也做不了太多，只能等專業的消防員過來處理。\n\n「呼…………」\n\n周澤剛剛打開了2號影廳的門，火苗居然直接向外面竄了出來，周澤只能後退暫避鋒芒。\n\n而在裡面，居然還有哭喊聲。\n\n周澤咬了咬牙，直接沖了進去，影廳里，到處都是火焰，地上，天花板上，牆壁上，都在著火，而且因為這裡空間逼仄的原因，導致燃燒出來的濃煙只能竄據在這裡。\n\n一般火災現場遇難的人中，被煙燻死的比火燒死的人要多得多。\n\n只有在這個時候，大家才覺得每次看電影前的讓人厭煩的消防通告視頻是多麼的重要。\n\n周澤剛衝進去，就看見在過道小空間裡，躺著兩個人。\n\n一個是穿著黑色西服的成年男子，他正躺在地上咳嗽著，顯然是爬不起來了。\n\n另一個則是年紀只有十歲左右的男孩，倒在地上不省人事，也不知道是昏迷過去了還是已經窒息死亡了。\n\n「救我……救我……救…………」西裝男子勉強抬起頭，看著站在前面的周澤。\n\n周澤直接跳過了他，將那個小男孩背起來，準備衝出去再說。\n\n他現在已經感到頭暈了，顯然，在沒有防毒面具等專業設備的前提下，他也支撐不了多久。\n\n然而，剛背著男孩準備跑出去，周澤只感覺自己腳下被人拉了一把，整個人摔倒在了地上，背上的男孩也滾落了下來。\n\n「救……救……先……救我……我……給你……錢……先……救我…………」\n\n西裝男耗盡最後一點力氣，死死地抓住周澤的腳踝，他知道自己沒辦法撐太久了，他現在根本就沒辦法呼吸，只感覺肺部火燒火燎般的難受。\n\n摔倒的周澤只覺得腦門一陣天旋地轉，幾乎差點昏迷過去，當下，他直接用牙齒咬了一口自己舌尖，強迫自己清醒過來。\n\n「砰！」\n\n「砰！」\n\n周澤用另一隻腳去踹那個抓著自己男子的手以及對方的頭，\n\n連續踹了幾腳之後，對方終於撒手了。\n\n周澤搖搖晃晃地再度站起來，將男孩背在自己身上，衝出了2號影廳。\n\n衝出滾滾濃煙，進入了安全區域時，周澤膝蓋一軟，整個人直接跪了下來，身上的男孩也落了下來，但因為有周澤下意識地鋪墊，所以摔得不嚴重。\n\n消防員已經趕到，正在著手滅火，還有一部分消防員穿著裝備沖入火場之中。\n\n「2號影廳還有人。」\n\n周澤抓住了身邊跑過去的一個消防員的衣服說道。\n\n「好，我知道了。」對方點點頭，沖入了火場。\n\n「呼呼…………呼呼…………」\n\n周澤橫躺在瓷磚地上，大口地喘息著，在他對面，黃色外賣服已經被熏成黑色的外賣小哥也靠在那裡喘息著，兩個人對視一眼，都有氣無力地笑了起來。\n\n救護人員也已經趕到，一群白衣天使和醫生，周澤已經沒力氣去找尋是否林醫生也在這場救護行動之中了。\n\n咬了咬牙，重新站了起來，周澤看了一眼正在被醫生急救的男孩，男孩胸口還在起伏，應該問題不大了。\n\n同時，周澤還看見之後被消防員抱出來的幾個人，有人沒救得起來有人被救起來了，那個穿著黑色西裝的男子躺在擔架上，一動不動，應該是沒氣了。\n\n周澤不覺得愧疚，他沒理由去覺得愧疚，\n\n自己是做好人，救人的，但到底先救誰，取決於自己，誰都沒理由去道德綁架自己。\n\n而且，在那個時候，自己根本沒能力背著一個小孩的同時再扛著一個成年男子一起跑出去，如果這樣做了，最終的結果只能是自己也死在裡頭。\n\n自己借屍還魂的是徐樂，一個手無縛雞之力的「書生」，又不是借屍還魂的施瓦辛格。\n\n況且，那傢伙差點害的自己也跟著死在電影院裡。\n\n艱難地爬起來，拒絕了身邊護士檢查自己身體情況的幫助，周澤走向了大廈另一端的衛生間裡，打開了水龍頭，使勁地用手捧著冷水揉搓著自己的臉。\n\n總算是，\n\n緩過氣來了。\n\n抬起頭，\n\n周澤看著鏡子裡自己，\n\n忽然發現，\n\n鏡子中，在自己身後，慢慢地出現了一道淡淡的人影，\n\n這個人，\n\n穿著黑色西裝，\n\n一臉的怨毒盯著自己。\n\n嘴巴張開不停地吶喊著，像是在質問自己什麼，歇斯底里，瘋狂躁動。\n\n人死後，若是遇到特定契機有一定概率可能化作厲鬼報復，\n\n而眼下，這個男子剛死，他的靈魂還處於化鬼的階段，大概會在「頭七」的時候徹底成型⁶。\n\n他還不是鬼，只能說是一個雛形。\n\n但因為周澤自己的特殊性，所以他能提前洞察到對方的存在，\n\n他在恨自己，\n\n不救他，\n\n甚至這種恨，\n\n不惜讓他變成了厲鬼！\n\n「呵，有趣。」\n\n周澤笑了笑，\n\n重新將自己的頭放入洗臉池之中繼續用水沖洗自己，\n\n同時又在心裡感慨了一聲：\n\n「呵，人啊…………」\n___\n¹

    "title": "Chapter 26: The Seventh Day",
    "content": "According to Jianghai Evening News (a Tongcheng local newspaper) report, in this cinema fire, seven people died in the blaze, and over thirty people sustained injuries of varying degrees.\n\nA week has passed. The cinema has been shut down, and it’s impossible for it to reopen anytime soon. It's even highly likely that this cinema will be abandoned altogether. It was already losing money being open here, so it naturally won't be grandly reopened.\n\nAs a result, this commercial complex has essentially declared its complete demise.\n\nDuring this time, Zhou Ze didn't contact Doctor Lin again. Both sides maintained an unspoken understanding of non-interference, living their own lives. However, his in-laws called several times, demanding to know why Zhou Ze wasn't coming home, accusing him of being brazen, and so on.\n\nZhou Ze later simply blacklisted their numbers.\n\nWhat's really troubling now is, the money to open this bookstore came from his in-laws. He was \"soft-mouthed from eating their food, soft-handed from taking their things\"*, but Zhou Ze still hadn't figured out a way to earn some money, so he could reopen a shop and achieve true independence.\n\nIt could only be said that the foundation Xu Le left him was too poor.\n\nSeveral media outlets did contact him, hoping to interview Zhou Ze about his heroic act of bravery, to promote positive energy in the new era. Zhou Ze chose to refuse all of them.\n\nHe had no interest in becoming famous. As the saying goes, \"a tall tree catches much wind\"**, with his identity and role, if he really became some sort of celebrity, there would be more uncontrollable dangers.\n\nThis week, business was mediocre. Daily sales were less than a hundred, not even covering the cost of rent and utilities. Zhou Ze, however, didn't really care about these things.\n\nWhat he cared about was that Xu Qinglang next door hadn't opened his shop for a week.\n\nZhou Ze hired an unscrupulous locksmith to help open the lock. He went inside and searched around, but found no plum juice-like items. The kitchen in the back room was meticulously clean and tidy.\n\nIt was frustrating,\n\nA man who owned over twenty properties and was very handsome,\n\nIf he suddenly, one day, \"saw through the mortal world\"*** and decided to wander freely like the wind,\n\nYou'd really have a hard time finding him.\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze had a rather miserable week.\n\nChili oil,\n\naged vinegar,\n\ndark soy sauce,\n\nhigh-concentration orange juice, and other methods had all been tried. Although they allowed him to eat some food, they all made him incredibly miserable, far less effective than Xu Qinglang's family's inherited plum juice.\n\nAs night fell, Zhou Ze squatted alone in front of the bookstore, a cigarette dangling from his mouth. His gaze occasionally flickered to the shop next door, with a distinct feeling of 'where in life can one speak of desolation'.\n\nOn the roadside in front of the shop, four or five pagoda incense sticks were burning. They were placed by people from the mall side. According to custom, today was for welcoming the God of Wealth. Even though it was clear the God of Wealth could hardly save this mall, the necessary gestures still had to be made.\n\nWhat if a miracle happened?\n\nOccasionally, Zhou Ze would glance behind him or at the glass in front of him.\n\nThe malevolent spirit of the man in the black suit was constantly perfecting itself. Tonight was his \"head seven\"**** ritual, so it should be almost complete.\n\nFor a malevolent spirit to take form is already an infinitesimally small probability. Furthermore, ordinary malevolent spirits at most cause you to trip while walking or bite your tongue while eating. For one to make you mildly ill and need two days of IV drips would already be considered an extraordinary malevolent spirit's trick.\n\nThings like malevolent spirits running rampant and killing people everywhere, as seen in movies, are simply impossible in reality. Otherwise, the mortal world would have been in chaos long ago.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, who had already \"borrowed a corpse to return a soul\"*****, was acting so discreetly,\n\nHow dare those mere 'scraps' without even a physical body come out and show off?\n\nThis week, when he had nothing to do, Zhou Ze would read books, space out, trim his nails, and incidentally check if the malevolent spirit behind him had become clearer.\n\nIt somewhat felt like... 'raising' something, experiencing a taste of 'fatherly love as profound as a mountain'.\n\nDaddy loves you,\n\nDaddy's waiting for you to grow up.\n\nZhou Ze could clearly sense the emotions of the one behind him. His greatest hatred wasn't directed at the cause of the fire, but at Zhou Ze himself. He was venomous, he was angry, he was expectant, he was waiting,\n\nPerhaps,\n\nIn his eyes, tonight, on his \"head seven\" day, was his moment for revenge.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Zhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette. Once he took form, Zhou Ze would \"tell him why the flowers are so red\"******.\n\nZhou Ze didn't feel he had done anything wrong in saving people. Nor did he think the man in the suit was wrong to hate him.\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had encountered a similar incident. Someone was drowning, and someone went down to rescue them. But the rescuer was held tightly by the drowning person, and they both drowned.\n\nGenerally, when going into water to save someone, you have to embrace them from behind for the rescue. If you approach from the front, it's very easy for the drowning person to clutch onto you like a last straw, holding on for dear life.\n\nOf course, understanding is one thing,\n\nBut understanding would not be a reason for Zhou Ze to allow the man in the suit to run rampant in his bookstore at midnight tonight.\n\nDuring the day, Zhou Ze ordered takeout. He chatted a bit with the new delivery driver, learning that the previous delivery driver who helped with the rescue had recently become popular. Not only had he attended various award ceremonies, but he had also been praised and rewarded internally by his company. He now had a nickname—\"the Hottest Delivery Driver.\" He was still delivering food, live-streaming while he did it, and his popularity was very high.\n\nZhou Ze, while pouring aged vinegar and eating, casually scrolled through Weibo. To his surprise, the delivery driver was in the trending topics.\n\nA week had passed since the incident. From the initial handling and summing up, to the current development and promotion of positive energy, it was precisely at the peak of public discussion and interest. The incident's influence had spread not only in Tongcheng but throughout the country.\n\nAt 11 PM, Zhou Ze was watching a movie, while observing the man in the suit slowly becoming more solidified. The movie was called *Demon Police*, a work from a few years ago by the recently famous director Dante Lam, starring Daniel Wu and Nick Cheung.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. The delivery driver, in his uniform, walked in while holding a selfie stick.\n\n“This is a bookstore I often visit. Every day, after my busy deliveries, I come here to read. It’s not for academic pursuit, I just purely enjoy reading.”\n\nAfter speaking, the delivery driver took down a copy of Wen Tiejun's *Eight Crises* from the bookshelf.\n\nThis book talks about China's economic crises throughout modern history. The delivery driver opened the book, sat on a plastic stool, and began reading with great relish.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that last time he came, he had read two volumes of *Battle Through the Heavens*.\n\n“Alright, that's it for today's live stream. I want to read quietly for a bit. Everyone should get some rest too. Thank you all for accompanying me today.” The delivery driver bowed to his phone screen.\n\nOn the phone screen, a barrage of 'card subscriptions', 'planes', and 'rockets' appeared. His popularity was indeed terrifyingly high.\n\nTurning off his phone, the delivery driver closed *Eight Crises* in his hand. He stretched, looked at Zhou Ze, and said:\n\n“Boss, let's go out for some late-night food. My treat.”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, pointing to the computer screen in front of him.\n\n“What are you watching?” The delivery driver leaned closer, looked at the screen, and smiled, “I’ve seen this movie. *Demon Police*, right?”\n\n“Mhm.” Zhou Ze nodded, simultaneously glancing at the time in the bottom right corner of the screen. Almost midnight.\n\nThe 'baby' behind him was already getting a bit impatient.\n\n“No reporters interviewed you?” the delivery driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“Actually, you should have accepted the interviews. That way, your bookstore business would be much better.”\n\n“I like quiet.” Zhou Ze 'acted cool' disingenuously.\n\nMoney is important, but life is more important.\n\n“Watch this movie later.” The delivery driver seemed to feel a connection with Zhou Ze, after all, they were companions who had rushed into the burning building together to save people.\n\nThere was some,\n\nmutual appreciation, perhaps.\n\n“Do you know, *Demon Police* is based on a real case? The real-life protagonist was apparently named Xu Bugao.” Zhou Ze began.\n\n“Hey, I really didn’t know that.” The delivery driver gave a somewhat shy smile. “It’s just a movie; who pays attention to that?”\n\n“Mhm, you’re right.” Zhou Ze shut down his computer and stretched. “It’s so late, what do you want to eat?”\n\n“Whatever, I guess.”\n\n“Then I’ll order some takeout.”\n\n“No, let’s go out to eat. My treat. What good stuff is there in takeout? I’m telling you, some restaurant kitchens are simply unbearable to look at. And some vendors don't even have physical shops; they just rent a dilapidated house and do it themselves. Tsk-tsk, I certainly wouldn't dare to eat that.”\n\n“I see.” Zhou Ze nodded. “By the way, do you know what happened with Xu Bugao?”\n\n“Won’t I know if you tell me?”\n\n“Killed his colleagues, embezzled money, then became a free spirit, even appearing on TV shows. He loved to show off, to be famous.” Zhou Ze touched the tip of his nose. “A very complex person; he really enjoyed being on camera.”\n\nThe delivery driver was silent for a moment, not continuing the topic, but instead said, “Boss, are you going for late-night food or not?”\n\n“I don’t want to go. Don’t you see how many pagoda incense sticks are outside my shop? They’ve been fumigating me all day; my appetite is completely gone.”\n\nPagoda incense sticks are large candles, taller than an average person, stacked like pagodas, very thick, and they burn for a long time.\n\n“Heh heh, there’s no smell in your shop at all.” The delivery driver pointed to the central air conditioning unit above Zhou Ze’s bookstore. “This must be an air purifier, right?”\n\n“Mhm, installed with the air conditioning. Plus, I usually spray some air freshener in the bookstore. After all, you have to create a reading atmosphere, right? Since I don't offer coffee or pastries, I can only provide pleasant scents.”\n\n“So, Boss, you’re still not \"giving me face\"*******?” The delivery driver pretended to be angry. “We did go through life and death together, after all.”\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, and asked curiously, “So, I’ve always been curious about one thing.”\n\n“What thing?”\n\n“That day, I didn’t smell anything at all. In my shop, it's very difficult, almost impossible, to smell other scents from outside. That day, how did you smell the fire?”\n\nThe delivery driver froze for a moment, his expression becoming somewhat unnatural, but he brushed it off, saying, “My nose has been good since I was little. My grandma used to say I had a \"dog’s nose\"********. When I was a kid, I was super accurate at finding hidden snacks at home.”\n\n“Do you know what day it is today?” Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n“What day?”\n\n“Head seven.”\n\n“Head seven?”\n\n“Yes, the 'head seven' of those seven people who died in the fire!”\n___\n**Footnotes:**\n*   \"Soft-mouthed from eating their food, soft-handed from taking their things\" (吃人家嘴軟拿人家手軟): An idiom meaning to be beholden to someone because you have accepted their favors or money.\n**   \"A tall tree catches much wind\" (樹大招風): An idiom meaning that prominence or high position attracts trouble or criticism.\n***   \"Saw through the mortal world\" (看破紅塵): An idiom meaning to become disillusioned with worldly affairs, often implying a desire to withdraw from society or pursue a spiritual path.\n****   \"Head seven\" (頭七): In Chinese tradition, the seventh day after a person's death is an important day for mourning rituals, believed to be when the soul returns home for a final visit.\n*****   \"Borrowed a corpse to return a soul\" (借屍還魂): An idiom describing reincarnation or a spiritual entity taking over another person's body.\n******  \"Tell him why the flowers are so red\" (告訴他花兒為什麼這麼紅): A colloquial phrase, meaning to teach someone a harsh lesson or to make them face severe consequences.\n******* \"Giving me face\" (給面子): To show respect, particularly to someone's status, reputation, or feelings.\n******** \"Dog's nose\" (狗鼻子): A colloquial term used to describe someone with an extremely sensitive sense of smell.",

    "content": "The delivery guy stood still, looking at Zhou Ze, who was sitting behind the counter.\n\n\"Don't be scared, the shop isn't equipped with cameras, and I don't have a voice recorder here either.\" Zhou Ze stretched. \"Of course, you definitely won't believe me when I say that. Tsk, suit yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by that.\" The delivery guy was very calm.\n\nSomeone who could do something like this must be very calm.\n\nThe police haven't specifically identified the arsonist yet; that's his skill, though here, of course, it's a derogatory term.\n\n\"I'm very sure that you were the one who started that fire.\" Zhou Ze spread his hands. He was merely stating a fact, a fact that needed no refutation at all.\n\n\"You're drunk,\" the delivery guy said.\n\n\"Not drunk.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Based on just that, you're saying I started the fire? You're better than the police?\" The delivery guy's expression was already starting to tighten, but he was still restraining himself.\n\n\"Huh... Of course I'm not better than the police, but I'm not blind. As for me saying I determined you were the arsonist based on that, I'm sorry, but that's really not it. I merely worked backward to find evidence after first confirming you were the arsonist, to experience what it feels like to be Conan.\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched out a finger and pointed behind the delivery guy.\n\nThe delivery guy immediately turned his head. He thought police officers were standing there, but there was no one, and no police siren sounds either.\n\nIn this nearly abandoned mall, and deep into the night, there wasn't even a single passerby.\n\n\"They all came in with you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who?\" The delivery guy furrowed his brow.\n\n\"The six people who died in the cinema, you know. They came in with you. Then I took one look and went 'oh,' you're the killer, it's as plain as day. Except for that idiot standing behind me who's solely focused on hating me, you can't possibly say the other six victims all got the wrong killer, can you?\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, looking at the delivery guy in front of him.\n\n\"Playing tricks!\" The delivery guy almost started to roar. For some reason, he felt the pressure on him growing, and cold sweat also began to stream down his face.\n\n\"Don't be nervous, they can't harm you.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the counter, carrying a plastic bag in his hand.\n\nInside the plastic bag were small boxed portions of rice and some pickles.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's line of sight, six people were all sitting on plastic stools, both men and women, two of whom were elderly.\n\nThey were all sitting there dutifully reading books, very quiet, not noisy at all.\n\nIn front of each person, Zhou Ze placed a bowl of rice with pickles on top, and disposable chopsticks stuck upright directly into the rice.^1\n\nThen, Zhou Ze took out a bottle of baijiu that cost less than 10 yuan, poured it into plastic cups from the water dispenser, and placed a cup in front of each person.\n\n\"Alright, folks, it's not easy for me either. This bookstore has been operating at a loss, so I can only treat you all with this. Don't blame me for being stingy, okay? You're dead, but I still have to keep living. Anyway, your families will also make offerings to you, so a little bit from me won't make much difference, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down, speaking as if he were greeting regular customers.\n\nHmm, as for that idiot behind him with a hole in his head, Zhou Ze wasn't kind enough to save a portion for him too.\n\n\"Are you out of your f***ing mind!\" The delivery guy couldn't hold back anymore. \"Heh, I really should record this, upload it online, and let all the online friends see what you're like!\"\n\n\"Do you dare?\" Zhou Ze turned sideways. \"You talk as if you really would. You've only been livestreaming for a few days, and Wu Wu has already fallen.\"\n\nYes, there were many reasons why the police hadn't found the arsonist yet, but if the police had a key suspect to investigate further, it would be very difficult for the arsonist to stay hidden.\n\n\"I'm leaving. You're crazy.\"\n\nThe delivery guy's pleasant demeanor from before vanished. He was able to successfully convert his popularity into livestreaming and also gain huge income, not just because he was a 'hero,' but also because of his own marketing strategy.\n\nHe was very down-to-earth, and his original image setting was very good. On this foundation, livestreaming food deliveries, which would normally be a very dry and dull thing, could still be fascinating to watch.\n\nHe knew clearly he was panicking, he was in a mess. Therefore, he wanted to leave, to escape this bookstore.\n\nHe regretted coming here today. He regretted it very, very much.\n\nZhou Ze didn't stop him. It was just that when the delivery guy reached out to push open the bookstore door,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, checked the time, and said:\n\n\"It's midnight.\"\n\n\"Dong!\"\n\nThere was no wall clock in the bookstore, but at this moment, the delivery guy felt as if he heard chimes ringing.\n\nHe pushed the door hard, but the door didn't budge an inch. He got angry. He checked the lock area; the door wasn't locked, and there was nothing blocking it, but the door just wouldn't open.\n\nThe delivery guy started kicking the door like crazy, but the door still didn't budge an inch.\n\nWhat he couldn't see was,\n\nthe six people who were originally sitting there reading,\n\nall slowly stood up.\n\nIt was the seventh day after death, the night of the soul's return,^2\n\nthe wronged has a head, the debt has a master,^3\n\nthey had come here, following their enemy.\n\nAnd now,\n\nthey were all staring intently at their enemy,\n\na guy who had clearly killed them by arson yet became a hero.\n\n\"I told you not to save me!\"\n\nA low roar came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze coincidentally blew on his fingernails at this moment, and then sharply turned around. The nails on his right hand instantly grew long, a translucent black emitting an unusual sheen, with strands of black qi swirling around his fingertips, bringing with them a terrifying aura.\n\nAt the same time, black mist also churned within Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n\"Hsssss... Aaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe black-suited man, who had just managed to transform into a vengeful spirit, was directly grabbed by the shoulder by Zhou Ze's hand. Then his whole body began to tremble. The black qi from Zhou Ze's fingertips continuously pierced his body like sharp little knives, and wisps of green smoke rose upwards from the top of the black-suited man's head.\n\n\"I understand you, but you disgust me.\"\n\nZhou Ze said in a deep voice,\n\n\"So, you'd better say goodbye.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingers exerted force again.\n\nThe black-suited man wailed and showed a pleading expression. He hoped Zhou Ze would let him off; he had already transformed into a vengeful spirit, and once he 'died' again, his soul would be scattered and annihilated, without even a chance to enter hell.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't let go,\n\nhis gaze remaining cold.\n\nHe waited until the black-suited man's body had completely melted and evaporated,\n\nonly then did he retract his hand. In his palm, he vaguely saw some ashes.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nZhou Ze blew into his palm, then clapped his hands.\n\nWhen he turned around, Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nHe didn't know if it was because of his presence here that the bookstore's layout had changed,\n\nor perhaps,\n\nthis was just a coincidence.\n\nThe six customers who had come in earlier and were just quietly reading books now all began to emit black mist from their bodies. This was a sign that they were about to transform into vengeful spirits for revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the delivery guy was still relentlessly smashing the wall with his fists and kicking it with his feet.\n\nLook up, whom does the heavens spare? Perhaps it's referring to the scene before him.\n\nThese six victims had also been panicking amidst the rolling thick smoke and raging fire, not knowing what to do, and ultimately failed to escape, dying tragically within.\n\n\"Everyone, please give me some face. Don't rush to become vengeful spirits.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked into the group and gestured to the six people with a raised hand.\n\n\"Come on, relax a little. How about you all give your big brother a smile?\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to ease the atmosphere. Once they transformed into vengeful spirits, they wouldn't enter reincarnation. After revenge, and once their obsession was completely gone, they could only dissipate with the wind.\n\nThis was the most tragic ending.\n\nZhou Ze felt it wasn't worth it, truly not worth it.\n\nThe arsonist had already caused your deaths, separating you from your loved ones by life and death. Your children lost their father or mother, your parents lost their children,\n\nThere's no need to push yourselves into an even more terrifying abyss because of this killer.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze's words had no effect whatsoever.\n\nThe expressions of these six people remained cold and icy, and the black mist on their bodies was growing thicker. Black patterns were beginning to emerge around their eyes and lips.\n\nThey were about to turn into the image of that idiotic black-suited man when he had just charged at him.\n\n\"Since you won't smile for your big brother, how about your big brother smiles for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze forced a very ugly smile.\n\nIt's over,\n\nthis is bad,\n\nit couldn't be salvaged.\n\nZhou Ze knew clearly that making these vengeful spirits scatter and annihilate was easy. For example, that idiot who had been following him for a week, just as his cooldown ended and he was about to unleash his ultimate move, was slapped to death by him.^4\n\nBut as for performing rites for the salvation of these ghosts, he really didn't know how to do it. Moreover, Zhou Ze himself was a ghost, so it wasn't convenient for him to do this. It was like asking Zhang Fei to do embroidery.^5\n\n\"The Netherworld has its path, the Yellow Springs can be crossed!\"\n\nA sharp shout came from outside the shop. Immediately after, the bookstore door was pushed open, and Xu Qinglang walked inside, holding a small porcelain bowl in his hand. There were grains of rice in the bowl, and three incense sticks were inserted into it.\n\n\"Rise!\"\n\nThe three incense sticks quickly burned,\n\nand at the same time, the grains of rice in the bowl turned from sparkling white to black. Meanwhile, the black mist on the six people's bodies began to fade at this moment. Finally, their expressions transformed from their initial cold solemnity to peace and tranquility.\n\nThe six people slowly sat down, sitting in front of their bowls and chopsticks.\n\n\"Xu Qinglang!\" Zhou Ze pointed at Xu Qinglang and exclaimed,\n\nvery excited,\n\ntruly excited,\n\nmore excited than seeing Doctor Lin after a bath,\n\njust thinking about how difficult it had been for him to eat over the past week.\n\nHow could he not be excited!\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang's performance just now, Zhou Ze wasn't surprised. Actually, everyone had just chosen to see through it but not reveal it.\n\nXu Qinglang rolled his eyes at Zhou Ze, and in an instant, a myriad of charms appeared, as if all the azaleas on the mountain had bloomed.\n\nBut at the same time, he said gruffly:\n\n\"Are you having a Lunar New Year midnight party here?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to.\" Zhou Ze briefly explained the situation to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, indicating he understood. He cupped one hand in the other and bowed to the six people, saying:\n\n\"Everyone, it's the seventh day after death, the night of the soul's return. You should still go back and see your loved ones; they should be waiting for you at home too. As for what happened here, I will give you all an explanation.\"\n\nThe six people heard this and silently passed through the glass and left.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze, however, was on the bowl containing the 'black rice.'\n\n\"How come this stuff has no effect on me?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth twitched. He forcibly suppressed the urge to flare up and fight Zhou Ze for three hundred rounds.\n\nHe snorted:\n\n\"You're different.\"\n\nHe was still angry, still had issues with Zhou Ze, and still felt unbalanced, but because of his appearance, temperament, and voice, that phrase, \"You're different,\" carried a strong hint of a secluded maiden's resentment.^6\n\nThen,\n\nXu Qinglang looked at the delivery guy, who was curled up in the corner, already scared unconscious. \"How should we deal with him?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Xu Qinglang made a 'cut-it-all-off' gesture.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Let's just hand him over to the state.\"\n___\n^1 Sticking chopsticks upright in rice is a common practice in some East Asian cultures for offerings to the deceased.\n^2 In Chinese tradition, the seventh day after a person's death is believed to be when their soul returns home for one last visit.\n^3 An idiom meaning that for every wrong, there is a specific perpetrator, and for every debt, there is a specific debtor; essentially, justice will be served or karma will unfold.\n^4 \"Cooldown\" (CD) and \"ultimate move\" (大招) are gaming terms referring to the time before a skill can be used again and a character's most powerful ability, respectively.\n^5 Zhang Fei was a fierce warrior from Chinese history, famous for his strength and fighting prowess. The idiom implies asking someone to do something completely unsuited to their nature or skills.\n^6 \"A secluded maiden's resentment\" refers to a subtle, delicate, and often melancholic type of grievance traditionally associated with women confined to their chambers, often implying unrequited affection or longing. Here, it adds a humorous, ironic touch to Xu Qinglang's annoyance.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze finally called the police, and the police came soon. According to Zhou Ze, he said that this foreign seller suddenly had a crazy accident when he came to his store. He said that many souls of the dead came to him to revenge him, and then kept kicking and smashing the wall wildly and finally passed away.\n\n\n\nWhen the police station finished recording, it was already bright. The cinema fire case was full of twists and turns, but now at least the situation has been opened. The police may have not suspected the foreign seller whom Yi Yong was just because of the darkness under the light. Even if there is no accurate evidence, as long as you really look at the other party and search, the truth should be discovered soon.\n\n\n\nAs for the subsequent reversal, the reversal of the online melon-eating crowd, and the stunned people who once gave this foreign seller a gift, they are not the problems that Zhou Ze needs to worry about and think about. There is only so much he can do, and there is only so much he wants to do.\n\n\n\n  It is better to leave the ghost to solve the problem of the ghost, and it is better to leave the problem of the human being to the police to solve the problem of the problem of the human being.\n\n\n\nStanding at the door of the police station, breathing the fresh air in the morning, and feeling awake\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to the store by car, Zhou Ze saw that the store next door, Xu Qinglang had already opened its doors for business again. Xu Qinglang changed his usual clothes and sat at the door of the store, placing the dishes and sunny, and humming the \"Boy's Drama\" (local style) in his mouth, leisurely, and a stream of scented out of his own.\n\n\n\n  everything,\n\n\n\nAs if it's still\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked to the store, Xu Qinglang clapped his hands and asked, \"What to eat?\"\n\n\n\n\"Just let me take a look, I want sour plum juice.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang point\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sat down in the store, and his fingers gently tapped the tabletop\n\n\n\n  It’s not too long that Xu Qinglang brought a bowl of chicken noodles. The soup was clear and the noodles were chewy. Of course, these were not important. The most important thing was that the familiar sour plum sauce appeared in front of Zhou Ze again.\n\n\n\n\"Make me a bucket, how much does it cost?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the bucket of the drink machine in the store, \"Make one bucket first.\"\n\n\n\n\"Should you wait for a while.\" Xu Qinglang sat down in front of Zhou Ze, holding a smoke in his mouth. He seemed to want to act like a little gangster smoking and hanging posture, but he gave people a sense of discomfort that \"women can be so beautiful even if they smoke.\"\n\n\n\nHe is not a mother or gay, so he can only blame God for giving the wrong skin\n\n\n\nAfter eating the noodles with sour plum juice, it was the first time. After eating the bowl of noodles, Zhou Ze's disgust was no longer so strong, but he still drank a few more glasses of water and it was relieved.\n\n\n\n\"Remember what happened to Lin Daiyu when she first entered the Jah Mansion to eat,\" Xu Qinglang asked in a sip of smoke.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought about it and understood\n\n\n\nLin Daiyu first entered the Jah Mansion and was at the first house banquet. After the meal, the servants gave her tea soup. Lin Daiyu was taught by her father at home and was not suitable for drinking tea and it was easy to digest indigestion. However, when Jah's mother and sisters were both drunk, she could only drink it with her.\n\n\n\n\"I can eat it\"Zhou Ze was shaking his head. With his current situation, it is very likely that this person could not become a gourmet or a gourmet. As for digesting the problem, let's talk about it again\n\n\n\n\"I feel a little unbalanced.\" Xu Qinglang opened the door to see Shandi and said, \"My parents are gone.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang's parents had already left, but Zhou Ze knew what Xu Qinglang meant when he said \"left\" this time, so he should go down.\n\n\n\n\"Why did you leave suddenly?\" Zhou Cheng asked. He wanted to respond to a \"morrow\". Thinking about it, it was not suitable\n\n\n\n\"I've been discovered\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's hand holding the smoke shook slightly,\n\n\n\nHave been discovered\n\n\n\nZhou Ze remembered that before the old man died, he also shouted, \"They found me.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze, \"I am very unwilling and unbalanced. Why did she take my parents away and not take you away?\"\n\n\n\n\"He and She\" Zhou Ze's image appeared in his brain. Then, combining Xu Qinglang's state of that day and his departure at night, he guessed it.\n\n\n\n\"She, that's impossible.\"\n\n\n\n\"The order of the sect is orderly, the deceased is on the road.\" Xu Qinglang lowered his voice and stared at Zhou Ze's eyes, \"The long tongue turns into a road, and the deep throat is Xu Youming, familiar.\"\n\n\n\n\"Black and white are inconsistent\"\n\n\n\n\"That's just a singularity.\" Xu Qinglang sighed, \"But they are indeed law-enforcers, traveling to the sun and pursuing order, dividing people and ghosts, and people telling each other, and ghosts have their own way.\"\n\n\n\n  \"oh\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze still didn't believe it. If Xiao Luoli was really a Bai Wuchang identity, then what would be the death of the car and the driver before she showed her true body and spit out her long tongue on the school car.\n\n\n\n\"She didn't take me away, but instead took your parents away, so you hate me.\" Zhou Ze pointed at himself\n\n\n\n\"Yes\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the head\n\n\n\n\"Then there is no poison here.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Xu Qinglang\n\n\n\n\"Don't poison it, right?\" Zhou Ze asked again\n\n\n\n\"No\" Xu Qinglang answered\n\n\n\n\"That's good.\" Zhou Ze didn't know that in the meaty food that day, the vegetables were poisoned. If Dr. Lin hadn't come earlier that day, he might have really eaten the food.\n\n\n\n\"Are you really stupid or fake?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze with some disgrace, \"Why didn't she catch you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, why didn't she catch me?\" Zhou Ze also asked\n\n\n\n\"I'm asking you.\" Xu Qinglang raised his voice\n\n\n\n\"I don't know either.\" Zhou Ze put his hands on his back, \"Maybe, it's because I saved her once.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Xu Qinglang\n\n\n\nThe conversation between the two people was finally burned with the cigarette head as the ending sign\n\n\n\nThe two sides opened the mountain this time, breaking the original silent tacit understanding\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked back to his shop and packed up the plastic benches on the floor, he found that there were six plastic benches with uneven thicknesses underneath them.\n\n\n\nThis is whether to read books or eatZhou Ze remembered that the old master who started the live broadcast in the past also gave him a stack of sluts, saying that they could replenish sluts, so his sluts were made in this way.\n\n\n\nHow did he get it\n\n\n\nZhou Ze collected all the slights, and they were all in a whole bunch, which felt good. It was not as rough as those slights you usually see. When you touch it in your hands, it felt like a silky touch.\n\n\n\nThis made Zhou Ze think of the underworld shop as the old Taoist said, and do business with ghosts. The best store is of course the underworld shop, because the things sold there are also for the dead.\n\n\n\nTherefore, if the slightest calves in your hand are the \"slightest tickets\" for the dead, then you will definitely be able to earn more than you can\n\n\n\nIn the brain, a man sitting behind the cabinet and drinking porridge appeared again in the video screen.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that\n\n\n\nI seem to have discovered something that might be very interesting\n\n\n\nOf course, no matter how interesting things are, I don’t have the energy to take care of them now. I didn’t sleep all night last night. Now that I’m back, I have to make a good idea.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pulled the bookstore down and put it on the lock. For some reason, his bookstore is opening more at night than during the day, or maybe he has the opportunity to order another brand in the future.\n\n\n\n  Call\n\n\n\n\"Late Night Book House\"\n\n\n\nAnyway, there is no business during the day, and the bookstore has been lying on it. You can play some gimmicks and do something casually. The worst result is not the current situation.\n\n\n\nThe foreign seller's business is a serious mistake, but it also gives Zhou Ze some trouble\n\n\n\nThe bathing equipment in the sanitation room has been installed. Zhou Ze bought a water heater and took off his clothes. Zhou Ze took a shower and changed into a set of dry clothes to the building.\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze lowered his waist and prepared to adjust the temperature of the ice cabinet, the whole person was stunned.\n\n\n\nBecause in the ice cabinet in front of him,\n\n\n\nA person lying down\n\n\n\nThe other party closed his eyes, as if he was in a deep sleep, breathing smoothly, his hands crossed in front of his chest, and he felt as peaceful as a little adult.\n\n\n\nVery calm and lovely,\n\n\n\nPrerequisite is,\n\n\n\nHer tongue wouldn't have become that long\n\n\n\nXiao Luli,\n\n\n\nTake your nest for the turtle\n\n\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to shout, so that Xu Qinglang, who was next door, would get revenge\n\n\n\nBut after thinking about it, let’s forget it. It’s not that he thought that calling Xu Qinglang to revenge was a harm to him, but he thought that Xu Qinglang didn’t come to revenge, and maybe he would ask with a sincere voice when he came:\n\n\n\n\"You're awake\n\n\n\nWhat do you want to eat\n\n\n\nI'll give you a way to do it.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli opened her eyes quietly. Her eyes were very deep, no longer the clear and simple way she had seen before.\n\n\n\nThe other party stretched out his hand, and Zhou Ze helped him open the ice cabinet.Xiao Luoli sat up from inside, and Zhou Ze noticed that she actually did not set the temperature, but just chose a ventilation and air conditioning.\n\n\n\n\"You are lying here, not cold.\" Xiao Luoli, who was sitting in the ice cabinet, asked. Before Zhou Ze could answer, Xiao Luoli opened her mouth again, \"Oh, I forgot, you are different.\"\n\n\n\nAfter saying that, Xiao Luoli, who was sitting in the ice cabinet, reached out and patted the empty space beside her, and looked at Zhou Ze innocently:\n\n\n\n\"Can you sleep together\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze reached out to rub the girl's head, but his hand was next to him and stopped.\n\n\n\nShe is an invariable existence in black and white, and is the wizard of the sage among people.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli reached out, and her little hand grabbed Zhou Ze's big hand, pressed Zhou Ze's hand on her head, and then pressed Zhou Ze's hand to rub it back and rub it back on her head.\n\n\n\n\"…………” Zhou Cheng\n\n\n\n\"You, it's great.\" Little Roo Li finally stood up from the ice cabinet, but it seemed that it was a bit difficult to climb out because of her short legs.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze carried her out of the ice cabinet.\n\n\n\nI don't know how she lies in before\n\n\n\n\"You are very good.\" Xiao Luoli pointed at Zhou Ze, \"repeat\"\n\n\n\n\"Amount... Thank you\" Zhou Ze didn't know how to recover\n\n\n\n\"I'm leaving.\" Xiao Luoli turned around, facing Zhou Ze, and crossed her hands behind her back. Zhou Ze knew that she wanted to show a kind of attitude that she admired.\n\n\n\nBut her problem is the same as Xu Qinglang.\n\n\n\nGod gave the wrong skin bag\n\n\n\nShe feels so cute no matter how she looks\n\n\n\nHold on,\n\n\n\nDon't laugh\n\n\n\nZhou Ze kept reminding himself,\n\n\n\nThis is black and white, unpredictable old man,\n\n\n\nDon't laugh\n\n\n\nHahahahahaha\n\n\n\nBut I still can't help it\n\n\n\nHe was dying hahaha\n\n\n\nFinished hahaha\n\n\n\nThe more you laughed, the more you became, the more annoying it became, and even your eyes were dripping.\n\n\n\nXiao Luli ignored Zhou Ze's laughter and did not cure Zhou Ze's crime of great disrespect.\n\n\n\nJust asked:\n\n\n\n\"You want to take over me.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 29: Is It Too Much?",
    "content": "「Do you want to take my place?」\n\nThis question made Zhou Ze freeze.\n\nWhat did this mean?\n\nFrom being an unregistered resident hiding throughout a city, was he suddenly going to become a local civil servant*?\n\nThe surprise came too suddenly;\n\nZhou Ze was a bit afraid to accept.\n\nPies do fall from the sky, but most people who encounter such things end up getting crushed to death by the pies.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze didn't believe that saving her life was worth her treating him this way.\n\nOne must know, the driver's incident hasn't been figured out even now. This little loli is very cute, but that's just her outward appearance.\n\nXu Qinglang said that she once appeared in his shop, expressionlessly sticking out her tongue and taking away all the departed souls of his parents.\n\nNo matter how Xu Qinglang cried and pleaded, she remained unmoved.\n\nFor someone like that, you can't hope for her to repay kindness; it'd be a blessing if she doesn't bite you back.\n\nAs an Underworld Bureau ghost messenger,\n\nHow much joy and sorrow, parting and reunion, has she seen?\n\nHow much human evil?\n\nHow much ghostly malice?\n\nShe's not a simple little girl, nor could she be.\n\n「What's wrong, speechless?」 the little loli asked again.\n\n「I don't know what to say. Are you just asking casually?」 Zhou Ze asked cautiously.\n\n「You can answer you don't want to,」 the little loli said.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nThe little loli continued, adding: 「Then, I'll drag you down.」\n\n「............」 Zhou Ze.\n\nAlright,\n\nIsn't that more comfortable?\n\nWhy bother with multiple-choice questions?\n\nJust fill in the blank.\n\nThe question is: if the answer isn't 'Y,' then it's execution.\n\n「I agree,」 Zhou Ze replied. This time, he didn't hesitate, nor was he conflicted.\n\nThe little loli turned around, smiling, with a hint of innocent charm. Then she slowly walked up to Zhou Ze, pretending to be a grown-up, wanting to straighten his collar.\n\nThis seemed like a superior showing regard for a subordinate, a bit like an ancient emperor granting a minister the chance to dine with him.\n\nIt's just that the little loli was too short; when standing in front of Zhou Ze, she couldn't straighten his collar, only his belt.\n\n「Pick me up,」 the little loli pouted, commanding.\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked up the little loli.\n\nThe little loli reached out to straighten Zhou Ze's collar, then frowned, seemingly feeling that being held by Zhou Ze like a daughter was somewhat improper.\n\n「Am I acting silly like this?」\n\n「Very cute.」\n\nThe little loli extended her small hand, intending to slap Zhou Ze's cheek directly.\n\nAt this instant, Zhou Ze's fingernails, while holding the little loli, rapidly lengthened and turned black, and black whirlpools swirled deep within his eyes.\n\nThe little loli stopped, a meaningful smile appearing at the corner of her lips.\n\nZhou Ze also made no further moves.\n\n「Do you know that revealing anger and defiance in front of me is a very foolish act?」 the little loli asked.\n\n「Doesn't matter. Anyway, I've already died once.」\n\n「That's because you were lucky; you only walked a short distance on the Yellow Springs Road before leaving. You haven't experienced the pain and torment of a trip to hell at all!」 the little loli exclaimed loudly. 「That kind of torment can make all those who commit suicide and go to hell regret it immensely! Better a bad life than a good death—that's certainly not empty consolation.」\n\n「Is that so?」\n\n「Put me down.」\n\nZhou Ze put the little loli down.\n\nThe little loli leaned back slightly, looking at Zhou Ze, 「Do you know why I chose you?」\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n「Because you're very smart, or rather, you're very composed and know your limits,」 the little loli said, counting on her fingers. 「The Underworld Bureau has its order, and the living world has its laws. There are many who sneak out for various reasons, but you are the most composed one I've seen.」\n\n「I don't believe that's the real reason,」 Zhou Ze said.\n\n「The real reason, I don't want to tell you,」 the little loli stretched. 「I'm tired and want to go down, so I happened to run into you, and you won't cause too much trouble for me, so I chose you.\n\nHehe, a while ago in Rongcheng, there was a guy who caused a lot of trouble. He was clearly a pitiful stowaway, yet he claimed to be a judge. As a ghost, he ridiculously tried to exercise his judgments in the living world. Don't you think he was stupid?」\n\n「Stupid,」 Zhou Ze replied. Immediately, Zhou Ze suddenly remembered that the old Taoist priest seemed to be from Rongcheng. 「What happened to him later?」\n\n「He was suppressed.」\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, her face full of innocent charm. 「Rules are flexible, but those who cross the line too much lose all hope.」\n\n「Is he dead?」 Zhou Ze asked. 「I mean, was he dragged back to hell or did his soul scatter?」\n\nUpon hearing this, a hint of irritation appeared on the little loli's face, as if her sensitive spot had been touched.\n\n「That, you don't need to know.」\n\nThe little loli grabbed Zhou Ze's palm, her small palm facing his.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze felt a burning sensation in his palm. When the little loli moved her hand away, Zhou Ze saw a black rune appear on his palm.\n\nThe rune wasn't complex; it looked like an eye.\n\n「The Underworld Bureau has its order, and the Yellow Springs can be crossed,」 the little loli said very seriously. 「Those who should go down, you send them down. Those who should be scattered, you can scatter directly.\n\nOf course, if you want to shout out against injustice,\n\nThat's fine too,\n\nBut you'll bear the cost of that yourself.\n\nIf you mess up, you'll suffer the consequences yourself.」\n\nThe little loli yawned, as if she were tired.\n\n「You said you're tired, so how long will you rest? Am I, like, a substitute?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「We'll talk when I come back,」 the little loli said, preparing to go downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze continued, asking, 「So what do I do? Go out on patrol every night,\n\nFind ghosts,\n\nAnd then,\n\nMess with ghosts?」\n\n「The gate is in your hands, you handle it yourself. You can continue running your bookstore. You are a ghost, a ghost who borrowed a corpse to return to life. Those dirty things and miscellaneous spirits will naturally gravitate towards you.\n\nTo them, you are a candle flame in the dark, and they are moths.\n\nAlso, after I left that mark on you, it's like upgrading you from a candle to an incandescent light bulb, bright enough to blind their dog eyes.」\n\n「............」 Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli went downstairs, and Zhou Ze followed her.\n\n「I'll read for a bit, then I'll leave. The mother of this body will come to pick her up soon.」\n\nThe little loli sat down on a plastic chair and casually picked up an illustrated book to flip through.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside her, not serving her, but rather having some questions to ask.\n\n「Go on,」 the little loli said.\n\n「This... is there a salary?」 Zhou Ze asked. 「You know, what I do here is a losing business.」\n\n「The economy's bad; it's getting harder and harder to earn money from the living now,」 the little loli lamented.\n\n「Yeah,」 Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n「Then earn money from the dead.」\n\n「Money from the dead can't be spent,」 Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n「That's because you're using the wrong method,」 the little loli spread her hands. 「Bring some spirit money, the kind that dead people give.」\n\nZhou Ze took out a wad of spirit money and placed half of it in the little loli's hand.\n\n「You've earned quite a lot,」 the little loli glanced, smiling.\n\nZhou Ze didn't mention that half of it was given to him by the old Taoist priest from Rongcheng last time. Instinctively, Zhou Ze felt that if the little loli knew about this, it would bring him trouble.\n\nThe little loli, holding the money, pushed open the bookstore door and squatted by the roadside.\n\n「Lighter.」\n\nZhou Ze handed over the lighter.\n\nThe little loli burned the spirit money. The ashes were quickly scattered by the wind.\n\nImmediately, the little loli stood up, clapped her hands, 「Done.」\n\nZhou Ze stood in the wind, feeling somewhat discombobulated,\n\n「Is this burning it in advance for my account in the underground bank?」\n\n「Just wait and see. Your place still doesn't have enough business,」 The little loli and Zhou Ze, one big and one small, stood by the shop entrance waiting, for about half an hour.\n\nThe little loli's delicate face was somewhat red from the wind. Zhou Ze wasn't afraid of the cold, but standing by the roadside like an idiot, gazing around, felt very strange.\n\nFinally,\n\nA pot-bellied man walked past them. Then, a wallet fell from the man, and he didn't even notice, continuing to walk forward.\n\nZhou Ze went up and picked up the wallet, finding that it surprisingly contained several thousand yuan, along with an ID card, bank cards, and other such items.\n\n「Should I return it to him?」 Zhou Ze asked tentatively.\n\nThe little loli let out a giggle,\n\n「This person did something disgraceful, so this time it's a financial loss to avoid disaster*. This money is what you deserve.」\n\nThe little loli pushed open the door and entered the bookstore, then rubbed her hands. Clearly, the past half hour had been quite cold, and the bookstore was warm.\n\nZhou Ze walked in with the wallet, somewhat disbelieving. 「He won't call the police?」\n\n「Take this money; it won't burn your hands,」 the little loli was getting a bit impatient.\n\n「Alright then, so when I'm short on money in the future, I'll just stand by the door and burn spirit money, and people will just voluntarily send money my way, right?」\n\nZhou Ze didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but also found it interesting.\n\nXu Qinglang walked over at this moment, carrying a large bottle of plum juice.\n\n「Hey, that's all the ingredients the shop has, so only this much could be made. For the rest, you'll have to wait...」\n\nAs soon as Xu Qinglang pushed open the door and entered, he saw the little loli sitting there, stumbled, and the bottle in his hand fell to the ground, smashing to pieces.\n\nPlum juice splattered all over the bookstore floor.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, gesturing for him to control himself.\n\nThe little loli seemed to completely disregard Xu Qinglang.\n\nIndeed, someone who was merely lucky and had a slight connection to the mystic arts wasn't truly worth her even a second glance.\n\n「Whose daughter is this? So cute, hahahaha. Come, little one, Uncle has a tank of small goldfish at home, want to come home with Uncle to see them?」\n\nXu Qinglang's laugh was very awkward, forced out.\n\nThe little loli simply uttered one word: 「Scram.」\n\nXu Qinglang chuckled again, turned around, and went back to his own shop.\n\n「Do you think I'm being too much?」 the little loli looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\n「A little,」 Zhou Ze said truthfully.\n\n「Then let me tell you this: the driver's death was just because I was bored sitting on the school bus at the time, so I revealed my true form to play a joke,\n\nWould you feel,\n\nEven more outrageous?」\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze with an innocently blank expression.\n\n---\n* 公務猿 (gōngwùyuán): A playful, often sarcastic, term for a civil servant, using the character for 'ape' (猿 yuán) as a homophone for 'member/employee' (员 yuán), suggesting a dull or uninspired bureaucrat.\n* 破財免災 (pòcáimiǎnzāi): An idiom meaning \"to lose money to avert a disaster\" or \"a financial loss prevents misfortune.\"",

    "content": "\"Is it too much?\"\n\nZhou Ze had no way to answer this question. Whether what the little loli said was true or false, he had no right to question it further.\n\nIt was helpless, but that was the truth.\n\nAlthough he heard from the little loli from Rongcheng that her \"kind\" in Rongcheng had attempted to act as a judge in the human world as a ghost, Zhou Ze greatly envied and revered him, but his end was also regrettable.\n\nWhen you lack the capital and the strength to stand on equal footing with the other party, you don't even have the right to an equal conversation, so where would you get the right to question them?\n\n\"Boring.\" The little loli shook her head, but then smiled. \"But that's exactly what I admire about you.\"\n\nThe little loli continued to hold the book with both hands, as if about to fall asleep, and murmured:\n\n\"You're the person I've met who most knows their place in their heart.\"¹\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nWas that a compliment or an insult?\n\n\"I'm leaving.\" The little loli grew increasingly sleepy and fatigued.\n\n\"I have one more question. Is there no other way to solve or improve the eating and sleeping issues?\" This was the question Zhou Ze most wanted to ask and was most eager to resolve.\n\nSince returning via borrowed corpse resurrection, apart from these two issues, he could perfectly integrate into social life at all other times.\n\n\"From a stability standpoint, an assembled computer isn't as good as a factory-built one.\" The little loli shook her head weakly. \"As for sleeping, unless you have a yin-creature that crawled out of hell nearby, allowing it to provide you with an environmental magnetic field similar to hell, you simply won't be able to rest. You were originally a person of hell. Lingering in the human world is like being unacclimated to the environment, and it's the most severe form of it. Because you have some special qualities, you can still resolve it with special methods. Others simply can't fall asleep; half a year without sleep, they are almost driven crazy, driven to death! Therefore, you're already considered lucky.\"\n\nThe little loli let out two more weak \"heh-hehs.\" \"If I didn't go back, you could certainly hold me while you sleep.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for eating, I still can't get used to human food even now.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the little loli's head tilted sideways, and she fell directly into a deep sleep. Zhou Ze reached out and supported her. Seeing that she still had breath and her body was normal, he immediately let out a sigh of relief.\n\nZhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he could naturally tell that the girl was fine.\n\nThis little one was Wang Ke's daughter; he couldn't just stand by and watch anything happen to her.\n\nHowever, what disappointed Zhou Ze a little was that the scene of the little loli leaving was a bit too ordinary.\n\n\"Shouldn't it be a 'biu' sound as she phases into the ground? Just falling asleep means she's gone back?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIt wasn't grand, nor was it impressive, like drawing a talisman in his own palm; there was no sense of ritual at all, no style.²\n\nThe little loli in his arms suddenly opened her eyes and said, \"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment. She was faking sleep!\n\nThe next moment, a mass of yin qi, so dense it seemed it would condense into droplets, surged from the little loli's body. Even with the central air conditioning on in Zhou Ze's bookstore, the temperature instantly dropped; the door was closed, but gusts of cold wind rose within, along with the sound of book pages turning.\n\nA vast shadow enveloped the area, like the reawakening of a ferocious beast, bringing a pressure that only ghosts could perceive.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew out again after this stimulation, and he felt a sensation of blood surging through his veins, as if the power within him was also responding to the other party.\n\nImmediately after, it truly was, a \"biu\" sound.\n\nAll the yin qi instantly surged into a single point underground.\n\nIn an instant, the clouds dispersed, the fog vanished, the temperature rose, sunlight streamed in.\n\nIn a trance, it seemed to truly fulfill the saying:\n\n\"Just like birds, having eaten their fill, return to the woods; leaving behind a vast, clean, white expanse of earth!\"³\n\n............\n\nIn the evening, Xu Qinglang delivered dinner. The plum juice was gone, replaced by bitter gourd juice.\n\n\"The sour *mei* juice⁴ is gone, so we'll have to make do with bitter gourd juice for now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said, looking a little embarrassed. During the day, when he saw the little loli, he was scared out of his wits.\n\nIn truth, he knew himself that he was very cowardly and useless. When his parents were taken away by the little loli, he didn't dare to confront her, much less resist. He could only kneel there and beg like a weakling.\n\nFurthermore, he had even taken his anger out on Zhou Ze for this, attempting to poison Zhou Ze's food.\n\nNow, Xu Qinglang had come to terms with it. If he was cowardly, then so be it. He was just a minor Xuan Master who possessed the Yin-Yang Eye due to his physical constitution. Asking him to face a Hell messenger, he truly didn't have the guts.\n\nIn fact, the little loli could have completely punished him for privately detaining his parents' departed souls, deducting from his lifespan, or even directly apprehending his soul and taking it back to Hell.\n\nShe treated him like a fart and let him go, so he had no need to jump around frantically anymore.\n\nThe dead cannot be revived, and his previous actions were indeed against the natural order.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze finished his meal, he took out a thousand yuan and placed it in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"That's for the previous meal expenses, plus some for future ones. Tell me when it runs out.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have money now?\" Xu Qinglang finally showed a slight smile on his face, then pushed the money back towards Zhou Ze and said softly, \"Life isn't easy, don't be extravagant. You need to be mindful of your household.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I'm a man with over twenty apartments, I don't care for this paltry sum from you.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say that he would soon have money too. As long as he earned more \"dead people's money,\" and then burned paper money for fun outside his door, some idiot would run to his shop entrance to drop their wallet, acting as an unwitting benefactor.\n\nBut Zhou Ze thought about it again. Even if he burned a truckload of Hell Bank Notes, he probably couldn't burn twenty-something apartments into existence, right? Unless an armored car had an accident right outside his shop...\n\n\"I plan to change storefronts. What about you?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly said.\n\n\"Change to where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere else would be better than here.\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"I plan to move the noodle shop to the county town below. It'll be smaller, but at least the foot traffic will be higher.\"\n\n\"I'll think about it,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"Alright, I'm leaving now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang collected the bowls and chopsticks and walked out of the underworld shop.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, was trimming his nails while looking at the symbol in his palm. It was evening, and no customers had arrived yet. Zhou Ze was a little anxious. Before, he saw no hope and just drifted through each day. Now that he saw the dawn of making money, his initiative naturally surged.\n\nWhat, no customers yet? Didn't we agree I was an incandescent lamp, capable of blinding their ghostly eyes?\n\nCome on, could it be that they've all been blinded and are now lost?\n\n\"Creak............\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and two women walked in.\n\nOne was very young, around Zhou Ze (Xu Le)'s age, and the other was likely close to fifty, appearing to be mother and daughter.\n\nZhou Ze recognized the young woman. She was his first customer since opening. He remembered she had come in with a Corgi, sat for a while, read a book, and then left him a hundred yuan, which was his first income.\n\nOnly, this time the woman wasn't leading a Corgi, but was with her mother.\n\n\"Oh, sit here. Be careful and check if there's anything dirty on it,\" the woman said to the girl.\n\nThe girl bent down, took out a tissue, wiped the plastic stool, and then slumped down.\n\n\"Take a book and read it, daughter. There's no problem that can't be solved, and no obstacle in life that can't be overcome. Try to see things more openly,\" the woman consoled her from the side.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The girl sighed, her expression still despondent, clearly not having taken it in.\n\n\"Daughter, take a book and read. If you read, you'll forget about time.\" The woman squatted beside the girl, continuing to console her, displaying the demeanor of a pitying parent.\n\nZhou Ze was still trimming his nails, paying them no mind.\n\nAt this moment, the girl looked at Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"Boss.\"\n\nThe girl called out very softly, looking pitiful and vulnerable, as if she had just broken up, a time when she was most fragile. Of course, to an \"old hand,\" this was the easiest time to \"insert a needle\" where there was a gap.⁵\n\n\"You're the boss, right?\" The woman looked at Zhou Ze, like a hen protecting her chick.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What are your intentions?\" the woman said warily. \"Daughter, ignore him.\"\n\nThe girl was silent for a moment, but finally spoke:\n\n\"Beibei is lost.\"\n\nBeibei was likely the name of that Corgi.\n\n\"Lost?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, lost.\" The girl's eyes were red, and tears welled up again, seemingly thinking of her beloved dog. \"When I was cleaning the house, it secretly ran out, and I didn't notice.\"\n\n\"If it's lost, it's lost. Just buy another one, why cry?\" the woman consoled her.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked over.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" the woman pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"It will be found.\" Zhou Ze ignored the woman and comforted the girl.\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\nThe girl cried, then reached out and hugged Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\n\"You wretched scoundrel! She lost a dog, not a man! What are you butting in for?\" The woman made a move as if to rush over and hit Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Do you have a say here?\"\n\nA wisp of black light appeared in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThe woman was immediately scared into letting out a shriek and curling up on the ground, not daring to babble anymore.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" The girl looked up blankly. She didn't know who Zhou Ze had just been speaking to.\n\nZhou Ze released the girl. When a person's emotions are at their lowest, that's when the three lamps on their body⁶ are weakest, and it's easy for dirty things⁷ to cling to them.\n\nFortunately, this woman, perhaps too lonely for too long, enjoyed chattering. As a person, she wasn't bad.\n\n\"I posted a lost dog notice online. I want to find it,\" the girl said, taking out her phone and showing Zhou Ze a picture of the dog.\n\n\"Boss, have you seen it?\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a bitter laugh. His business was so desolate here that people didn't even come, let alone dogs.\n\nBut the woman, who had just been scared into paralysis on the ground by Zhou Ze, shouted at this moment:\n\n\"I've seen this dog, I've seen this dog! It was right in my housing complex; when my husband and that 'little vixen' were 'doing their thing,' I really couldn't stay at home anymore, so I went to the complex to clear my head and saw someone walking this dog past!\"\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: \"心裡最有逼數\" (xīn lǐ zuì yǒu bī shù) is a modern Chinese slang phrase meaning someone is very self-aware, knows their capabilities and limitations, or is pragmatic about their situation, often implying they won't overestimate themselves. It can be slightly informal or blunt.\n² Translator's Note: \"沒B格\" (méi B gé) is internet slang meaning \"no style,\" \"no class,\" \"lacking prestige,\" or \"not cool.\"\n³ Translator's Note: This is a famous couplet from the classical Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*, symbolizing the desolation and emptiness after everything has come to an end.\n⁴ Translator's Note: Xu Qinglang makes a pun here. \"酸梅汁\" (suānméizhī) means plum juice. \"酸妹汁\" (suānmèizhī), which sounds similar, literally means \"sour *mei* (girl) juice,\" a humorous and slightly suggestive play on words.\n⁵ Translator's Note: \"見縫插『針』\" (jiàn fèng chā 'zhēn') literally means \"to insert a 'needle' where there's a gap.\" While the original idiom \"見縫插針\" means to seize every opportunity, the author uses a literal \"needle\" (針, zhēn) with a sexual double meaning, implying taking advantage of someone's vulnerability.\n⁶ Translator's Note: In Chinese folk belief, people have three \"lamps\" or \"fires\" on their bodies (on the forehead and shoulders), representing their vital energy (yang qi). When these lamps are weak, a person is more susceptible to negative influences or spirits.\n⁷ Translator's Note: \"髒東西\" (zāng dōng xi) literally means \"dirty things,\" a common euphemism in Chinese for ghosts, evil spirits, or other malevolent supernatural entities.",

    "content": "\"Where is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Xingfa Community. A man and his daughter were leading it, I remember.\" The woman said with great certainty. \"I even knew that man when I was alive, and I argued with him! He actually tried to take advantage of this old lady back then, tried to flirt with this old lady!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and warned, \"If you're lying to me or trying to play some ghost trick of 'killing with a borrowed knife,'* I'll make sure you won't even be able to be a ghost.\"\n\n\"How could that be, big brother? Although I'm dead, I'm still a good person. Go ask around my community, who doesn't say that I, Sister Hong, am a warm-hearted good person?\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, signaling her to be quiet.\n\nThe girl didn't know who Zhou Ze was talking to. Of course, Zhou Ze's voice was also very low, like he was muttering to himself.\n\n\"It seems a friend told me that there's a family in Xingfa Community who has a dog like this, or something similar. You can go there and ask,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Really? Okay, I'll go right now.\"\n\nAfter the girl finished speaking, she took out her wallet to pay.\n\n\"Never mind, don't pay.\"\n\n\"You should, thank you, Boss, for providing the information.\" The girl took out five hundred yuan and insisted on giving it to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Let's talk about it once you find it,\" Zhou Ze still refused to accept the money.\n\n\"Then, thank you, Boss.\"\n\nThe girl wiped away her tears and left the bookstore.\n\n\"What a good girl,\" the woman was still sitting on the bookstore's tile floor.\n\n\"You can get lost now too.\"\n\n\"Big brother, I finally found someone who can hear me. Can't you stay and chat with your elder sister a bit longer?\"\n\nThe woman looked as if she had really been holding it in and enduring it for a long time.\n\n\"No time.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat back behind the counter, picked up a nail clipper, and continued trimming his nails.\n\n\"Big brother, you opened your bookstore here, I'm afraid there isn't much business, is there?\" The woman was still trying to find something to chat about.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to suddenly remember something and asked, \"Do you want to go down?\"\n\n\"Down?\" The woman was stunned for a moment, seemingly not understanding.\n\n\"To where you should go now.\" Zhou Ze just remembered that he seemed to still be a part-time Ghost Catcher.\n\n\"Can I not go down?\" The woman said, a little troubled. \"My son is taking the Gaokao** this year, and I want to stay with him until it's over before I leave.\"\n\nAh, the pitiful hearts of parents everywhere.\n\n\"If your son knew his deceased mother was still studying with him at night, he'd surely be moved to tears,\" Zhou Ze teased.\n\nMoved to tears might not be likely, but being scared into sickness and directly failing Gaokao (GG)*** is highly possible.\n\n\"I'll just stay and watch,\" the woman said, a little wronged.\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, too lazy to say anything more. The little loli**** had said when assigning him work that unless he deliberately overstepped and acted as some damned judge of the underworld, he could act according to his mood at other times.\n\nAnyway, the little loli hadn't given him any performance reports requiring him to collect how many ghosts each month or quarter.\n\n\"Big brother, how did you become human?\" The woman said, very curious.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThe woman's body trembled a few times consecutively, and she immediately dared not speak again.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later, the woman muttered to herself that her son should be back from evening self-study, and then left the bookstore.\n\nAfter she left, Zhou Ze specifically walked over and flipped over the stool she had just sat on, but didn't see any ghost money.\n\n\"She's truly a woman who knows how to manage a household.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed, wondering if his temper was too good.\n\nHe was a temporary Ghost Catcher after all, considered someone 'within the system,' and she dared to come empty-handed and leave empty-handed?\n\nDid she really not see temporary workers as officials?\n\nPushing open the door, Zhou Ze walked out of the bookstore and pulled out a cigarette to light. Next door, Xu Qinglang seemed to have just finished cleaning, and walked out wearing an apron. He looked at Zhou Ze, then squatted down next to Zhou Ze and asked for a cigarette.\n\nThe two men squatted in a row.\n\nBehind them,\n\nwas an almost deserted commercial center, and in front, an empty road.\n\n\"That little girl was picked up by her mom?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"She went down,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, she went down.\" Xu Qinglang let out a breath. \"After going down, it'll be hard to come back, right?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\nJust as the little loli had said, when he went to hell, he merely walked a short distance on the Yellow Springs Road***** and came out, never having truly experienced the horrors of hell.\n\n\"What does hell actually look like?\" Xu Qinglang asked, blowing out a smoke ring.\n\n\"I don't really know.\"\n\nThere wasn't much more to talk about, but going back into their respective shops felt even more boring. After finishing their first cigarette, they naturally lit a second.\n\n\"Where's your wife?\" Xu Qinglang brought up what shouldn't be brought up.******\n\n\"Separated,\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThen, silence again.\n\nNext,\n\nwas the third cigarette.\n\n\"I'll be going back to my hometown in a while. I'll remake some plum juice for you tomorrow and save some.\"\n\n\"Thanks, you're not from around here?\"\n\n\"I'm from Menhai.\"\n\nMenhai is a county-level district under Tongcheng.\n\n\"A relative of mine is getting married. To be honest, I don't want to go, but not going isn't an option. After all, it's a friendship from when we played in the mud together as kids and shamelessly followed wedding processions to ask for red envelopes and lucky money.\"\n\n\"He wants you to go back as a bridesmaid?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, bridesmaid...\" Xu Qinglang realized and immediately glared at Zhou Ze. \"It's a best man.\"\n\n\"Did you get married in your previous life?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"That's great then. It's like getting a wife for free this life.\"\n\n\"She doesn't even...\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, not continuing.\n\nSuch a persistent thought,\n\nXu Le's persistent thought,\n\nis still there!\n\nMm, it must be so.\n\n\"If you're alive, just live well. My parents are gone, completely gone. I've come to terms with it. I have to grow up, I have to find my own life.\n\n\"Maybe, in a while, I can also get a girlfriend.\"\n\n\"A boyfriend is more likely.\" Zhou Ze blew out a smoke ring, adding a cutting remark.*******\n\n\"Heh heh, ever since I was little, I've been designing my future wedding in my mind: what style, what kind of look, what kind of grandeur...\"\n\n\"Isn't that something only girls think about?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Can't a man also fantasize about it? You shut up, or you won't have any juice to drink tomorrow!\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, \"Fine, I'll shut up.\"\n\n\"I plan to have a traditional-style wedding, a very vintage kind.\n\n\"I don't want luxury cars, I want an eight-bearer sedan chair, just like the kind seen in movies.\n\n\"Then I'll go rent a horse, wear a mandarin jacket or Hanfu,\n\n\"That kind of atmosphere,\n\n\"Do you understand?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pointed forward,\n\n\"Is that what it's like?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned for a moment, squinting his eyes forward, and said, \"What is it?\"\n\n\"You can't see it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression froze. He quickly returned to the shop, and soon, he was rubbing something sparkling onto his eyes. Immediately, he let out a cry of surprise.\n\nIndeed,\n\nin the empty street ahead, a red eight-bearer sedan chair was moving towards them.\n\nThe sedan bearers had red ropes tied around their waists and red ceremonial hats on their heads. The eight bearers moved in perfect unison;\n\nas they moved, it was \"nine shallow, one deep.\"********\n\nBecause of this, every once in a while, the sedan chair would jolt, and the bearers and the two people playing suona******** in front would all bounce together.\n\nIt looked very festive.\n\nBut in this deserted area, the sudden appearance of this scene was enough to scare passersby out of their wits.\n\nEven Xu Qinglang, facing such a scene, was momentarily open-mouthed and somewhat at a loss.\n\n\"Your wife?\" Zhou Ze said, pointing to the wedding procession ahead.\n\n\"Bullshit.\" Xu Qinglang retreated a few steps, almost backing into the shop. Seeing Zhou Ze still squatting there, he shouted, \"Aren't you going back? This is a ghost wedding procession!\"\n\n\"Will she throw the embroidered ball?\" Zhou Ze patted his pants legs and slowly stood up.\n\n\"If you're caught, you'll become the 'fortress husband'.\"*********** Xu Qinglang scoffed. \"Do you want to be a bookstore owner or do you want to be captured to be a female ghost's husband?\"\n\n\"That serious?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. The ghosts he had seen before didn't have such great abilities, or to be precise, didn't have such great influence.\n\nIf the occupant of the sedan chair could truly capture a person's soul and make them go back with her to \"marry,\" should he interfere or not?\n\nHe could turn a blind eye to that woman; presumably, once her son finished Gaokao, she would lose her obsession and dissipate to report to hell. But this one in front of him,\n\nwith such a grand display, was definitely not a simple character.\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Xu Qinglang stood inside the shop, looked up at the talismans pasted above him, and still felt uneasy. But seeing Zhou Ze remain unmoved, he cursed angrily:\n\n\"You're just a rookie ghost. Those ones have already become powerful spirits! If you back off, she might not bother you.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Vaguely, he felt the mark on his palm seemed to be heating up, as if reminding him that this one in front of him needed to be sent down, otherwise it would affect the mortal realm.\n\nAs for the previous woman, Zhou Ze allowed her to leave, and the mark had no reaction, which counted as tacit approval.

No problem! He'll handle it! From now on, this area will be under his jurisdiction!\" Xu Qinglang had a smug look, acting as if he was usurping authority, utterly flamboyant.\n\n\"My Lady has commanded us to pick up Your Excellency, and at the same time, wishes for us to capture a man to return and get married with her;\n\n\"It is said that this man has over twenty mortal residences, which perfectly matches my Lady in terms of family status.\n\n\"May I ask, Your Excellency, if you know where this person is?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n---\n*   \"Killing with a borrowed knife\" (借刀殺人, _jiè dāo shā rén_): A Chinese idiom referring to a strategy of using someone else to achieve one's own goals, often to harm a third party without directly getting involved.\n**   Gaokao (高考, _Gāokǎo_): China's national college entrance examination, a highly competitive and stressful exam.\n***   GG: A gaming term commonly meaning \"good game,\" but often used informally to mean \"game over\" or \"failed miserably.\"\n****   Little loli (小蘿莉, _xiǎo luólì_): A term from anime/manga/web novels referring to a young, cute girl, often implying she has hidden power or influence.\n*****   Yellow Springs Road (黃泉路, _Huángquán Lù_): In Chinese mythology, the path that the souls of the dead must travel to reach the underworld.\n******   \"Brought up what shouldn't be brought up\" (哪壺不開提哪壺, _nǎ hú bù kāi tí nǎ hú_): A Chinese idiom meaning to bring up a sensitive, awkward, or taboo topic, literally \"to pick up the pot that isn't boiling.\"\n*******   \"Adding a cutting remark\" (補刀, _bǔ dāo_): A gaming term meaning to deal the final blow, often used colloquially to mean making a sarcastic or hurtful comment to someone who is already in a difficult position or feeling low.\n********   \"Nine shallow, one deep\" (九淺一深, _jiǔ qiǎn yī shēn_): A phrase often used to describe a rhythmic movement, particularly in traditional Chinese music or even sex.

    "content": "The world is declining, people's hearts are not what they used to be!\n\nMany lament this present era, where the entire society has been scourged to its core by the tide of materialism, so much so that even marriage has been placed on the scales for equivalent exchange.\n\nHowever, these days, even ghosts are starting to be particular about this when getting married!\n\nYou have over twenty residences for the living,\nWhat a coincidence,\nMy mistress has over twenty residences for the deceased,\nA perfect match!\nJoy, joy,\nEveryone rejoices!\n\nAfter the suona elder asked this question, Zhou Ze's mouth twitched subconsciously.\n\nHe was holding back laughter, and at the same time, he felt truly content inside.\n\nZhou Ze had long wanted to punch this neighbor of his, who always had “I have over twenty houses” on his lips; this ghost mistress truly came at the right time.\n\nKarma comes full circle!\n\nXu Qinglang was so scared he broke out in a sweat. He was a mystic, but he merely opened Yin-Yang eyes, played with puppets, and incorporated some “Sichuan Opera face-changing” tricks; he wasn't a true Celestial Master Zhang-type existence, otherwise, he wouldn't have been so cowardly when facing the little loli.\n\nXu Qinglang, who had immediately sobered up, began to look up,\ngazing at the sky.\nWhat did you say,\nI don't understand.\nThat person,\nI don't know.\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang's eyelid suddenly twitched, because he saw Zhou Ze's right hand, which had been at his side, raise an index finger and point directly at him.\n\n“@#￥%……*&*！！！！！”\n\nTen thousand bottles of sour plum juice galloped through the depths of Xu Qinglang's heart!\n\nThe two suona musicians walked directly to Xu Qinglang's sides and respectfully said:\n\n“Please, young groom, enter the sedan chair.”\n\nAlright then, so this sedan chair wasn't for picking up the ghost messenger; it was specially brought by the ghost mistress to marry her new groom.\n\nZhou Ze once again redefined his “temporary worker” status in his mind.\n\n“Don't pull me, don't drag me, don't force me!\nBe careful, I might turn hostile!”\n\nXu Qinglang was pushed towards the sedan chair by the suona musicians, but he was still struggling nonstop.\n\nHe had just said he wanted to start a new life, find a partner and such, but he didn't mean to get involved with ghosts!\n\n“Zhou Ze, you tricked me, you harmed me!” Xu Qinglang cried out, giving off the distinct impression of a decent woman being forced into prostitution.\n\nRather die than submit,\nChastity forever!\n\n“Go take a look, maybe that ghost mistress looks just like Wang Zuxian, you wouldn't be at a disadvantage, would you?” Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\nXu Qinglang was pushed into the sedan chair. The suona musicians said to Zhou Ze: “Sir, you may follow us; we will lead the way.”\n\nAfter speaking, the suona musicians also pointed to the electric bicycle parked at Xu Qinglang's doorway:\n“Sir, you may ride it.”\n\nZhou Ze remembered that the last time he rode in that ghost driver's paper car, he was still safely delivered to the bookstore entrance. So, it was clear that some ghostly entities indeed possessed abilities similar to Qi Men Dun Jia; some physical theories likely didn't apply to them.\n\nThe electric bicycle belonged to Xu Qinglang. Zhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony; after locking the shop door, he directly rode the electric bicycle, following the sedan chair ahead.\n\nThe sedan chair bearers walked very quickly,\nTheir steps were still nine shallow, one deep,\nAnd each time they took that “deep” step, the eight bearers along with the two suona musicians would all bounce together, making the sedan chair sway with them.\n\nImmediately after,\nXu Qinglang, sitting in the sedan chair, would let out an “ah” sound;\nLike the soft chirping of an oriole, melodious and alluring, inviting imagination.\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze was riding his electric bicycle abreast with the sedan chair, Xu Qinglang lifted the sedan curtain and looked out. At this moment, Xu Qinglang's face was flushed, and in his eyes, there seemed to be a glistening, “autumn wave” gaze, as if he had been nourished.\n\nHis pearly teeth tightly bit his red lip, a truly charming and bashful, handsome appearance.\n\nJust then, the bearers executed another “deep” step, and the sedan chair suddenly lifted,\n“Ah!”\n\nXu Qinglang subconsciously let out another cry, his face showing a look of indignation. He stared fixedly at Zhou Ze, truly overcome with shame!\n\nZhou Ze, holding the electric bicycle's handlebars with one hand, waved his other hand lightly, disdainfully saying:\n“Shameless.”\n\n“This sedan chair affects the soul, it stimulates the soul!” Xu Qinglang had to explain aloud. He was genuinely worried that Zhou Ze would think he was enjoying it and couldn't extricate himself.\n\n“Explanation is pretense,” Zhou Ze said. “Mouth says no, but body says yes.”*\n\n“…………” Xu Qinglang.\n\nWith lingering resentment, Xu Qinglang cast a final glance at Zhou Ze before lowering the curtain,\nThat glance was as if he were looking at a heartless man who, for fame and fortune, had even willingly sacrificed him!\n\nActually, Zhou Ze could see that the sedan chair bearers and suona musicians were moving according to a special rhythm; they were mere puppets, their true forms likely paper figures from a paper craft store, somewhat akin to the wooden oxen and flowing horses designed by Zhuge Liang during the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nThe bearers continued “nine shallow, one deep”,\nXu Qinglang would “ah” every so often,\nAnd Zhou Ze followed all the way on his little electric scooter.\n\nUnknowingly, the procession had already passed the urban area and entered the Tongzhou District.\n\nA few years ago, Tongzhou District was still a county-level district under Tongcheng; it had only recently been re-designated as a district. Zhou Ze had been to this place once before, when he helped the old woman from the morgue find money.\n\nFinally, the sedan chair procession entered a desolate plot of land diagonally off Jianghai Avenue. This area was surrounded on all sides by tall buildings, and it was likely a construction site that had been put on hold for special reasons.\n\nThe road inside wasn't good for driving anymore, so Zhou Ze had to get off and push his electric bicycle forward.\n\nAfter another few tens of meters,\nSuddenly,\nIt opened up!\n\nThe previously dark and desolate barren area suddenly became brightly lit with lanterns and streamers. Ahead, over twenty outdoor banqueting tables were set up, each with ten plates of cold dishes neatly arranged.\n\nA bustling crowd, a heap of rouge and powder, with cheerful laughter and chatter.\n\nA busybody raised his voice and shouted: “The groom is here!”\n\nAt once, women in makeup and elegant dresses swarmed forward. Zhou Ze felt himself surrounded by a lively throng of women, some passing directly through him and his bicycle, back and forth, tirelessly.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze's right hand was tightly clenched, and the mark was still hot.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze didn't need the mark to remind him; it was clear that this place was where the ghost messenger needed to resolve things.\n\nBecause the ghosts here, under the ghost mistress's call, had already become organized and established; this, of course, could not be tolerated!\n\nBut Zhou Ze was still holding back. For one, he had just become a temporary worker, and there was no rush to “light three fires upon taking office”**; otherwise, he might burn himself to death. After all, in the mortal world, whenever something goes wrong in a department, it's usually the temporary workers who end up taking the fall. Zhou Ze figured it should be similar in the underworld, since people from the mortal world only go to the underworld after they die.\n\nFurthermore, Zhou Ze also knew that if it were truly easy to deal with, why wouldn't that little loli resolve it herself?\n\nThe other party even dared to invite him, a ghost messenger, to their doorstep for congratulations, which was enough to show their brazen confidence.\n\n“Sedan chair down!”\n\nThe bearers collectively lowered the sedan chair, and Xu Qinglang was pushed out. He was very reserved, and also shy, and at the same time, overcome with indignation and shame.\n\n“The mistress invites you.”\nA woman in a black traditional-style dress walked up to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang and bowed deeply.\n\n“Let's go.”\nZhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder.\n\nXu Qinglang slapped Zhou Ze's hand away with great distaste, but still followed Zhou Ze forward.\n\nPassing through the banquet, seeing all sorts of ghosts pointing and whispering around him, Zhou Ze felt quite unaccustomed to it. Fortunately, when they reached a small two-story red house, the various cacophonous sounds finally became inaudible.\n\nThis building was brightly lit with lanterns and streamers, large lanterns hung, and new Spring Festival couplets were put up, presenting a lively and festive scene.\n\nThe building's layout was very similar to modern buildings, with the main entrance opening into the living room. The black-dressed maid gestured for Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang to enter.\n\n“Excited?” Zhou Ze suddenly asked. “What if she really has the same aura as Wang Zuxian, you might lose yourself in pleasure and never want to leave.”\n\n“I hope she likes 'one dragon playing with two phoenixes',”\nXu Qinglang said viciously, clearly indicating his stance of dragging Zhou Ze down with him if he was unlucky.\n\nIt was truly because Zhou Ze had spared no effort in kicking him while he was down along the way, seeming to have been bent on watching him make a fool of himself!\n\nDidn't he just usually like to have “I have over twenty houses” on his lips?\nIsn't that the truth!\nDid he intentionally show off or something?\n\nStepping into the hall, they walked on a large red carpet, and exquisite cross-stitch embroidery hung on all four walls.\n\nA woman in a red wedding dress sat gracefully by a small table.\nExquisite dishes and wine were set on the small table.\n\n“Sir, my groom, please sit.”\nThe woman rose and gestured for the two to sit.\n\nBecause the woman's face was veiled by a head covering, it was unclear.\nBut her voice was truly beautiful.\n\nZhou Ze took a seat and pulled Xu Qinglang, who then reluctantly sat down.\n\nSince we are here, let's make the best of it, and see what tricks she has up her sleeve.\n\nThe dishes on the small table were very exquisite and fragrant, and the wine was very mellow, refreshing to smell.\n\n“Sir, honored guest, please eat.” The ghost mistress gestured with her hand for the two to dine.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move, maintaining his composure.\n\nXu Qinglang, his face full of grief and indignation, heartily drank three cups, then exclaimed: “Good wine!”\n\nImmediately after, he ate nonstop, completely transforming his grief and indignation into appetite.\n\nZhou Ze watched from the side, his chest rising and falling in waves, covering his mouth with his hand.\n\n“What's wrong? Eat, it's delicious, better than what I make myself.” Xu Qinglang himself was a chef, so he could naturally discern the quality of dishes.\n\nDon't you ever watch horror movies?\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nBut he still said nothing; instead, he picked up his chopsticks, helped Xu Qinglang with some food, put it into his bowl, and instructed:\n\n“Good boy, eat more. There's no sour plum juice here, and I can't eat anything, you know.”\n\nXu Qinglang “hmph-hmph”ed twice, suspecting nothing else, and continued to eat. Even if he died, he'd die a full ghost!\n\nAnd, it really was delicious!\n\nXu Qinglang was even thinking about whether he should find an opportunity later to discuss and learn some recipes from the ghost mistress. These dishes, if put on the market, even the top chefs of five-star hotels couldn't make them taste so good.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang had eaten his fill,\n\nZhou Ze nodded in satisfaction,\nAnd asked the ghost mistress: “Mistress, may I ask how these dishes are made?”\n\n“Sir, you are too kind. This wine was brewed by this humble one using passersby's urine;\nAnd these dishes were meticulously prepared by this humble one, using the freshest snakes, insects, rats, and ants…”\n\nXu Qinglang's face suddenly changed,\nHe stretched out a finger, pointing at Zhou Ze, but before he could say anything,\nHe simply:\n“Oooogh………………”\n\n---\n*   **Mouth says no, but body says yes (口嫌體正直)**: An internet slang phrase that describes someone who outwardly expresses dislike or disapproval for something, but whose actions or true feelings reveal the opposite.\n**   **A new official sets three fires upon taking office (新官上任三把火)**: An idiom meaning a new person in a position of authority will often adopt harsh or drastic measures to establish their power or make their presence felt, sometimes to prove their capability.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang puked his guts out, almost bringing up his bile.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head slightly. This kid was still too young. He must have watched too few ghost movies when he was little. Encountering a ghost in the wild and eating with it—that was actually the most classic scene.\n\nThe delicacies originally served on the plates were actually maggots, earthworms, cockroaches, ants, and so on.\n\nThis trope was already overused.\n\nEven if he didn't have an eating disorder, Zhou Ze wouldn't touch them with his chopsticks.\n\nDid you really expect the ghosts here to go grocery shopping every day? And then set up a stove to cook for you?\n\nZhou Ze remembered a case from before: someone visited a friend, and the friend said his wife was traveling, so he could only host him alone. He stayed at the friend's house for a week, and the only regret was that the friend's home had too few vegetarian dishes, only meat, but the meat soup was really delicious.\n\nAfter he said goodbye to his friend and left, he ran into a neighbor. The neighbor said the friend hadn't left his house for almost a month, staying shut in all day.\n\nThe man immediately vomited after hearing that.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up the drink in front of him, then put it down.\n\nHe almost forgot.\n\nIt was pedestrian urine.\n\n\"Master isn't feeling well, so he should go rest first.\" The Ghost Madam looked at the black-gowned maid beside her.\n\nThe maid nodded and walked over, ready to help Xu Qinglang up.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed the maid's assisting hand away, sat up straight, and said:\n\n\"Just say what you want to do quickly. I don't want to play any more games.\"\n\nIndeed, Xu Qinglang was angry.\n\nHe was thoroughly angry.\n\nThe Ghost Madam stood up and walked to Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze could clearly smell the fragrant scent emanating from her. Her graceful figure and full curves couldn't help but stir one's imagination.\n\nZhou Ze secretly breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nHe had spent a long time with Xu Qinglang, but he was still normal.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't have the courage to lift the Ghost Madam's red veil.\n\nBeauty is but withered bones; that's natural.\n\nLooking at the layout and decorations here, it was clear that this Ghost Madam had been dead for a long time. If he lifted her veil and she was in a good mood, she might show him her face from when she was alive.\n\nIf he was unlucky, she might use a skull face, corroded with maggots everywhere, to blind his dog eyes.\n\nZhou Ze remembered reading a report in his previous life. At that time, it was very popular for husbands to accompany their wives into the delivery room.\n\nMany idealistic romantics¹ believed this would allow husbands to understand their wives' sacrifices and greatness. Later, a Japanese husband became directly depressed after accompanying the birth, developed psychological trauma, and could no longer lead a normal marital life, eventually having to choose divorce.\n\nAnd now, Zhou Ze knew he had a neighbor even prettier than a woman by his side. If he were to be startled by the Ghost Madam's face again, his orientation might truly head into an unfathomable abyss.\n\nIn both his past and present lives, he seemed to have never truly gotten what he desired from women. Zhou Ze didn't want to skip steps and jump straight into an advanced game in this life.\n\n\"Esteemed official, this concubine invited you here instead of actively visiting. It's not that this concubine is rude or intentionally neglected you; it's truly because this concubine has no other way to leave this place.\" The Ghost Madam complained to Zhou Ze with a tearful voice.\n\n\"As for this Master, the reason I invited him here is simply because over ten years ago, when he was just a child, he passed by here and left a casual remark. He said to his companions at the time that if a female ghost was truly like Joey Wong in the movies, he would be willing to marry her and take her home.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Xu Qinglang's jaw dropped.\n\nHe himself had forgotten about this?\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, glanced at Xu Qinglang, his look conveying: \"Didn't expect that. You look so effeminate, yet you were so precocious.\"\n\n\"Specifically, what is the matter?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't directly say, \"You're very disobedient, I'm taking you back to Hell.\"\n\nThe little loli once said he was the most self-aware person she had ever seen.\n\nIndeed,\n\nZhou Ze now truly knew what he was doing. Without benefit, performance metrics, or tasks, he really didn't need to sacrifice himself for the prosperity and flourishing of Hell.\n\n\"Esteemed official, do not worry. This concubine will depart today, and my soul will return to the underworld.\" The Ghost Madam smiled and continued: \"This concubine's surname is Bai. I was the daughter of a scholarly family during the Daoguang period. However, my fate was ill-fated; I died prematurely on the eve of my wedding and was buried here. From then until now, it has been nearly two hundred years.\n\n\"Although this concubine is a ghost, I have never committed any malevolent acts. I once protected the local villagers, allowing them to live in peace and contentment. Mr. Se'an once inscribed a tablet for this concubine's shrine, and from that time on, this concubine had a temple, able to receive incense offerings.\n\n\"However, for nearly sixty years, the shrine has been dilapidated and long untraceable. Nowadays, no one knows that such an unofficial shrine² once existed here.\"\n\n\"Who is Mr. Se'an?\" Xu Qinglang blinked and asked.\n\n\"Zhang Jian,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Oh, him.\" Xu Qinglang now understood.\n\nZhang Jian was a famous figure in Tongcheng during the late Qing Dynasty. The abdication edict of the Qing Emperor was drafted by him. He was the *Zhuangyuan*³ (top scholar) of the late Qing Dynasty and also a national industrialist.\n\nThe \"unofficial shrine\" that the Ghost Madam mentioned did not refer to some disreputable place, but rather a shrine not recognized by the imperial court's rites, belonging to deities of unofficial worship.\n\n\"Then you're quite impressive,\" Xu Qinglang said, having recovered from his vomiting. After the Ghost Madam explained that she invited him only because of a casual remark he made as a child, he relaxed. As long as she wasn't forcing him to be her husband, it was fine.\n\nCultivating for two hundred years, and even having a shrine built for her and receiving incense offerings—surely this meant she had transcended the level of a mere ghost?\n\n\"Now, this concubine's cultivation is complete, and I am about to descend into the underworld. However, there is one matter I cannot ignore.\" The Ghost Madam curtsied slightly to Zhou Ze, pleading:\n\n\"This concubine's former physical body, due to the circumstances of its burial, has remained uncorrupted for two hundred years, lifelike. Now, this concubine's soul is about to enter the underworld, but my physical body cannot be taken with me.\n\n\"Moreover, over these two hundred years, this concubine's physical body, due to its connection with this concubine's soul, has shown signs of becoming a malevolent entity. This concubine does not wish for her physical body, after her soul descends, to awaken due to some unforeseen circumstance and commit acts that harm heaven and reason. Therefore, I earnestly request your assistance, Esteemed official.\"\n\n\"How do I help you?\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his hands. Since this Ghost Madam intended to go to Hell herself, that was for the best. This was like surrendering.\n\nNo, it wasn't like surrendering. It was more like ancient rebel forces, after growing to a certain extent, accepting the imperial court's amnesty, washing away their past, and gaining official positions.\n\nBut no matter what, as long as it wasn't a head-on confrontation with him, it was fine.\n\n\"This concubine requests that you, Esteemed official, help oversee this concubine's physical body. Then, on the night of the next Han Yi Festival⁴, burn it with bamboo and wood.\" The Ghost Madam said.\n\n\"Oversee it?\" Zhou Ze thought for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"Esteemed official, have you agreed to this concubine's request?\" The Ghost Madam confirmed, \"This concubine thanks you here, Esteemed official.\"\n\n\"You're too kind.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up the wine cup again.\n\nMm,\n\nAnd put it down again.\n\n\"Then, this concubine shall take her leave.\" The Ghost Madam's figure slowly began to fade, departing very decisively.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. The next moment, Zhou Ze found that all the surrounding scenery had vanished. He and Xu Qinglang were sitting on two stone stools.\n\nThe banquet around them had also completely disappeared without a trace. As far as the eye could see, there were jagged rocks and dense weeds.\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette, feeling somewhat melancholic.\n\n\"Disappointed you didn't get to see what your wife looked like?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Why didn't you lift the veil yourself and take a look?\" Xu Qinglang snorted coldly.\n\nAs distance tests a horse's strength and time reveals a person's heart, Zhou Ze had repeatedly kicked him when he was down tonight. Xu Qinglang had kept a record of it all in his little notebook.\n\n\"She's your wife, how could I overstep?\" Zhou Ze looked around, then stomped his shoe on the ground. \"Is Madam Bai's corpse underneath this spot?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Xu Qinglang said, also unsure. But soon, his eyes spotted two rusty shovels lying in the grass ahead. \"It must be, then. They even prepared shovels for us.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over. He and Xu Qinglang each took a shovel. There was nothing more to be said. Start digging!\n\nThe two of them dug together until dawn, drenched in sweat, finally hitting something hard underneath. Pushing aside the dirt above, they could clearly see it was a redwood coffin.\n\nThey spent about another half an hour completely clearing the coffin.\n\n\"Open the coffin,\" Zhou Ze said. \"It's almost dawn. Let's finish early, or if someone sees us and calls the police, they'll think we're grave robbers.\"\n\n\"You do it,\" Xu Qinglang wiped his sweat. \"I find it disgusting.\"\n\n\"Didn't she say her body hadn't rotted?\"\n\n\"Who knows if that's true?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. There was nothing for it. This was something he had promised to do. Xu Qinglang was only helping out of friendship. If he wasn't willing to do it, Zhou Ze would have to do it himself.\n\nPrying open the coffin nails, Zhou Ze stood at the side and pulled hard. The coffin lid was lifted. Then, Zhou Ze took out his phone, turned on its flashlight, and shone it downwards.\n\n\"Heh... she really is quite beautiful.\"\n\nXu Qinglang also leaned closer. Indeed, the woman lying in the coffin was wearing a white dress, with long hair draped over her shoulders. Her face was dignified and beautiful, and her physical body had no problems whatsoever; she looked as if she were sleeping.\n\n\"She's your wife, do you want to, while she's still...\"\n\nXu Qinglang suddenly pushed Zhou Ze. \"What nonsense are you spouting? Quickly, carry her out and take her back.\"\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang was very enthusiastic. He jumped down and picked up the female corpse.\n\nBut as soon as he lifted her from the ground, Xu Qinglang's face instantly changed. He immediately put the female corpse down, then rubbed his hands incessantly at the side.\n\n\"Hiss... So cold, a bone-chilling cold! This corpse has a heavy malevolent energy. It's clearly on the verge of becoming a jiangshi⁵! Madam Bai definitely didn't tell the whole truth.\n\n\"She must have, out of a woman's natural vanity, deliberately nurtured her own corpse for these two hundred years.\n\n\"Now that her cultivation is complete and she's ready to leave, she's only now leaving behind such a big problem.\"\n\nZhou Ze personally went down. When he picked up the female corpse, Zhou Ze immediately sensed that chill, which seemed capable of stimulating the soul.\n\nBut in the next moment, Zhou Ze found his fingernails beginning to lengthen. That chill, which Xu Qinglang had earlier called malevolent energy, began actively pouring into Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nA sensation of thrilling numbness that soared to the heavens made Zhou Ze's soul tremble completely. This seemed to be a form of nourishment.\n\n\"Hoo... uh... hiss... woooo...\"\n\nXu Qinglang, who was still checking his palms for frostbite on the side, heard Zhou Ze's sounds and immediately showed a look of shock, pointing at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"You beast,\n\n\"You actually really went at it while she was still...!\"\n___\n¹ **Idealistic romantics**: \"小清新\" (xiǎoqīngxīn) literally means \"small fresh and clean.\" It refers to a subculture or aesthetic characterized by being fresh, simple, and pure, often associated with idealism, romanticism, or a certain trendy, innocent style.

    "content": "While it was still dark, Zhou Ze rode his electric scooter back to the bookstore with the female corpse. As for Xu Qinglang, he waited there for a taxi to take him back.\n\nAfter all, he had arrived in a sedan chair; there was no sedan chair for him to take back.\n\nBack at the bookstore, Zhou Ze placed the female corpse in the freezer on the second floor of the shop. Then he went downstairs to take a shower. When he came out, dressed in fresh clothes, Xu Qinglang, who had finally managed to hail a taxi, had just returned. He walked straight into the bookstore, looked at Zhou Ze's wet hair, and teased:\n\n\"You need to control yourself.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze only replied with these two words.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head and left the bookstore without saying anything more; he was also tired from the night's events.\n\nZhou Ze locked the shop door and went upstairs to the second floor. He stood by the freezer, looking at the female corpse inside.\n\nThe female corpse's face was delicate, and her aura was striking. People in ancient times married quite early; it was common for women to become mothers at fifteen or sixteen. Because of this, the body of Madam Bai, who died before her marriage, looked about the age of an ordinary high school student, but she possessed a natural allure.\n\nXu Qinglang's beauty was enchanting, like a blooming peony, whereas Madam Bai before him was like a restrained daisy.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wouldn't have excessive fantasies about a corpse. What he was thinking about was something else entirely.\n\nHis ten fingernails, which had been in contact with the female corpse while he carried her on the electric scooter all the way back, felt as if currents of electricity were coursing into his body, constantly stimulating his soul and fingernails.\n\nFortunately, Xu Qinglang wasn't around when he returned, otherwise Zhou Ze probably would have cried out, just like Xu Qinglang had in the sedan chair on the way there. Such things were best kept private.\n\nBy the time he carried her back to the bookstore, Zhou Ze found that most of the cold aura around her had dissipated.\n\nIt was like a rechargeable battery; he had just absorbed its charge, but the problem shouldn't be big. Lying there, she should be able to naturally recharge herself.\n\nHe placed his palms in front of him, and his fingernails slowly grew longer. A blood-red pattern actually appeared on the previously black and translucent nail bed. This must be a change from his fingernails absorbing the corpse's malevolent energy.\n\nIt actually looked quite nice.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, reached for the cup of warm water he had just brought up, only to find that the water was already cold.\n\nBecause of the female corpse, the temperature on this entire small second floor was even lower than outside, and Zhou Ze himself had a somewhat diminished perception of \"cold.\"\n\nIt was a pity it wasn't summer. If it were summer and the female corpse was here, his shop could even save on air conditioning costs, and it would also have the effect of repelling mosquitoes and insects.\n\nThat night, Zhou Ze made a simple bed by the freezer and slept very soundly.\n\nThe little loli had once said that if Zhou Ze hugged her, he could fall asleep without needing the freezer. It seemed the female corpse had a similar effect.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze stretched. He placed his fingernails on the corpse's lower abdomen. Immediately, the icy sensation returned.\n\nIt was very comfortable,\n\nvery enjoyable,\n\nbut this feeling only lasted for about half a minute before dissipating. This meant that the female corpse had only recharged this much last night.\n\nMadam Bai had said she was worried her body might move on its own. Xu Qinglang also said that if the dense malevolent energy on this corpse were stimulated externally, it might turn into a zombie. However, it seemed the probability was low now. Whatever malevolent energy she accumulated, he would absorb each day.\n\nAlthough he didn't know what this thing was useful for him, just the comfortable sensation alone was enough to keep Zhou Ze enjoying it tirelessly.\n\nAfter eating at Xu Qinglang's shop next door, Zhou Ze was leisurely sitting in his shop, and before he could decide which book to read, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\nIt was his sister-in-law's call.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back for a moment.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze didn't believe his sister-in-law would suddenly call him to show concern. The young girl was still in her rebellious phase, a bit self-centered, or rather, actually somewhat selfish and unruly.\n\n\"Your elder uncle is at our house, come and take him away.\" His sister-in-law said impatiently.\n\n\"Elder uncle?\" Zhou Ze frowned slightly. He remembered that Xu Le, like himself, was also an orphan. Of course, Xu Le didn't grow up in an orphanage; his parents had passed away one after another after his birth.\n\n\"Alright, I'll be back.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Zhou Ze greeted Xu Qinglang next door and asked him to watch the shop for him. Then he hailed a taxi, preparing to return to the Lin family's home.\n\nWang Ke's treatment suggestion for him was to temporarily cut off ties with his existing social network. But times had changed. Before, Zhou Ze was undocumented, somewhat like a rat scurrying across the street<sup>1</sup>. Now, he was a temporary civil servant, and the things he needed to worry about and the dangers had significantly decreased.\n\nFurthermore, Zhou Ze had previously looked through Xu Le's private journal written in his space. It mentioned his elder uncle, who had always supported his education.\n\nSince he had taken over someone else's body, some matters that needed to be explained should still be explained. What's more, Xu Le had long since gone to hell to report for reincarnation. His previous changes in temperament actually had nothing to do with Xu Le; it was a side effect of borrowing a corpse to revive.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze returned to the Lin family's home, before he even entered the door, he saw an old man in a padded jacket with a wrinkled face sitting on the steps in the stairwell, smoking a dry pipe.\n\nBeside the old man were a few fertilizer sacks. One sack likely contained chickens and ducks, and another likely contained sausages and similar items.\n\n\"Ah Le!\" The old man saw Xu Le approaching, immediately stood up, and walked over to Xu Le. He reached out and patted Xu Le's shoulder firmly: \"The child has grown taller again.\"\n\nZhou Ze grinned. He didn't ask why his elder uncle was sitting in the stairwell smoking. In fact, there was no need to ask.\n\nEven if his elder uncle had voluntarily come out to smoke his dry pipe so as not to pollute their house, the local produce he brought wouldn't still be left outside the house. This could only mean that the Lin family didn't welcome him, and hadn't even let him in the door.\n\nRecalling his sister-in-law's tone and attitude when she called him earlier, it was enough to explain the Lin family's attitude towards his elder uncle.\n\nOf course, there was nothing to complain about or hate. His relationship with the Lin family was already on the verge of breaking. It was not a matter of who was specifically right or wrong.\n\n\"Have you eaten?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No,\" the old man said honestly.\n\n\"I'll take you to eat.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze chose a restaurant, ordered a few dishes after entering, and also asked for a bottle of baijiu.\n\nThe old man poured and drank by himself. After a few sips of alcohol, it was clear his mood was heavy. Evidently, he felt the Lin family's coldness. They were in-laws, after all, and now they weren't even bothering with decorum.\n\n\"Le Wa'er, if you're not happy, just come back home and live.\" The elder uncle patted his chest. \"Now, the nation's targeted poverty alleviation policies are very good, and our family won't have to worry about not being able to make ends meet. You've also been to college. If you come back, we can also try to do some special farming or something, and our lives won't be worse than others.\"\n\n\"Alright, we'll talk about it later.\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The elder uncle knew Xu Le didn't drink, so he didn't ask Zhou Ze to drink with him. He slowly finished the bottle by himself, then ate two bowls of rice. After Zhou Ze paid the bill, he carried his things and walked out of the restaurant with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Take these things with you. They don't want them, so you eat them.\" The elder uncle handed several woven bags to Zhou Ze. \"I'm catching the afternoon bus back.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze didn't try to make him stay.\n\nHis elder uncle seemed to have a good alcohol tolerance. Zhou Ze called a taxi for him, paid the driver in advance to take him to the bus station. Afterward, Zhou Ze carried these things back to the bookstore.\n\nXu Qinglang was sitting at the doorway, basking in the sun. Zhou Ze placed a pile of local specialties in front of him.\n\n\"Oh, what's this?\"\n\n\"For you to use as ingredients.\" Zhou Ze found a chair nearby and sat down.\n\n\"Alright.\" Xu Qinglang didn't stand on ceremony; he hadn't charged Zhou Ze for meals before. \"By the way, you told me your real name is Zhou Ze, but you haven't really talked about your past. What did you used to do?\"\n\n\"A doctor.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThere was nothing to hide from Xu Qinglang about these matters.\n\nMoreover, his identity was now cleared, so he wasn't afraid of official scrutiny.\n\n\"A doctor? Then you and your wife truly make a pair.\" Xu Qinglang leisurely puffed out a smoke ring. \"I haven't seen your wife come by for several days.\"\n\n\"No chance.\" Zhou Ze said very nonchalantly.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe two of them smoked another cigarette together. Zhou Ze stood up, pushed open the bookstore door, and walked inside.\n\nWhen he went out that morning, he had instructed Xu Qinglang to look after the shop for him, so he hadn't locked the door.\n\nHe sat down behind the counter, opened his computer, and clicked on an icon. Then, video information appeared on the desktop.\n\nZhou Ze had bought two pinhole cameras a while ago and placed them in the shop. One was by the stairwell, and the other was in the upper-left corner of the bookstore's main area. They weren't expensive; typically, peeping Toms bought them.\n\nHe casually picked up the cup on the counter, took a few sips of water, and began adjusting the playback time on the video.\n\nWhen he left that morning, Zhou Ze deliberately hadn't locked the door and had asked Xu Qinglang to look after the shop for a reason.\n\nYesterday, Madam Bai had invited him over, and also invited Xu Qinglang with a sedan chair. Although she had explained it was due to a joke Xu Qinglang made as a child, Zhou Ze didn't entirely believe it.\n\nHe had brought the corpse back and kept it here. If Madam Bai and Xu Qinglang had any other connection, Xu Qinglang should have made some move this morning.\n\nOne should always be on guard against others. He wasn't even human anymore; naturally, he had to live more cautiously.\n\nAt 11:30 AM, the footage showed Xu Qinglang entering his shop.\n\nZhou Ze took another sip of water, feeling that the water in the cup was somewhat sweet and exceptionally delicious.\n\nIt must be a psychological effect, perhaps because he was smug about guessing correctly?\n\nHowever, in the footage, Xu Qinglang merely entered the shop, picked up a few newspapers, and sat there reading for half an hour. He then put the newspapers back in their place and left, not going up to the second floor at all.\n\nHad he guessed wrong?\n\nWas he a petty man judging a gentleman<sup>2</sup>?\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips and chuckled to himself. He drank the water in the cup in one gulp.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to close the footage and wash his face, he suddenly remembered the camera by the stairwell. This camera's position allowed observation of the stairs and the counter area on the first floor.\n\nHowever, since Xu Qinglang hadn't gone inside, it probably wouldn't matter much whether he watched it or not.\n\nBut because these types of cameras were cheap, their memory was relatively small. So Zhou Ze still needed to delete the used memory to free up space.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze casually opened the video recorded by the second camera. He fast-forwarded through it from beginning to end, just going through the motions.\n\nHowever, at that instant, Zhou Ze seemed to see a white shadow fleetingly pass by.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously dragged the mouse back. He picked up the teacup with his other hand, only then realizing that the water in the cup was already gone.\n\nAt that moment, he couldn't bother to pour more water.\n\nInstead, he dragged the mouse slowly, bit by bit,\n\nFinally,\n\nthe footage captured that moment,\n\nA woman dressed in white clothes slowly walked down from the second floor!\n\nThat corpse,\n\nshe could move!\n\nZhou Ze felt a rush of blood to his head. A sense of crisis immediately washed over him. His heart and breathing became a bit more rapid at that moment.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was pondering this matter,\n\nthe footage continued to play.\n\nIn the footage,\n\nMadam Bai's corpse walked to the counter, picked up the water cup placed on it,\n\nthen,\n\nshe drank like a dog,\n\nsticking out her tongue and stirring it around in the cup a few times,\n\nAfterward, she put down the cup, like someone getting up in the middle of the night to drink water when thirsty.\n\nShe then turned and slowly walked upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, looking at the cup beside him, from which he had just drunk all the water.\n\nNo wonder when he drank the water just now,\n\nhe thought it tasted a little sweet............\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> *Like a rat scurrying across the street (过街老鼠)*: An idiom describing someone intensely disliked or an outcast.\n<sup>2</sup> *Petty man judging a gentleman (小人之心妒君子之腹)*: An idiom meaning to judge a noble or magnanimous person with the mindset of a petty or narrow-minded one.",

    "content": "**Second Floor,**\n\n**Beside the freezer,**\n\nZhou Ze stood for about half an hour.\n\nMadam Bai was still lying inside, exactly as she had been when Zhou Ze got up and left that morning, without the slightest change. But the images recorded by the surveillance camera couldn't be wrong.\n\nEspecially,\n\nthat glass of water,\n\nhe had found it a bit sweet when he first drank it.\n\nThis wasn't his imagination, because he hadn't watched the video before drinking the water.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze didn't feel too disgusted by the fact that he had drunk the other party's saliva. After all, he had just seen Xu Qinglang eat so many exotic delicacies last night.\n\nCompared to Xu Qinglang, his experience this time was merely a drop in the bucket.\n\nOf course, he didn't find it \"sensual\" either.\n\nNo matter how beautiful the woman before him was, she was merely a corpse, a two-hundred-year-old corpse lying underground.\n\nThe thought of her not having brushed her teeth for two hundred years was hard for the mildly obsessive-compulsive Zhou Ze to accept.\n\nShe could move. She went downstairs, drank water, and came back up.\n\nMadam Bai, didn't tell him the truth?\n\nOr there was another possibility: because of his fingernail last night, this corpse had also undergone some changes.\n\nCurrently, Madam Bai's soul had already reported to hell. It was unlikely she would deliberately drop any bombs in the mortal world.\n\nLittle Loli had once said that ghosts in the mortal world had to tuck their tails between their legs and \"act human.\"¹ Anyone who wanted to cause trouble was simply tired of living or found life too comfortable.\n\nHowever, having a corpse on his second floor and having a corpse that could move on his second floor gave Zhou Ze completely different feelings. No one wanted an unstable and dangerous factor right by their bed.²\n\n\"Hey, big sister, why don't you wake up and we can chat?\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned against the edge of the freezer and said.\n\nHe hoped this female corpse would open her eyes right now, either fight him or talk to him. They could find common ground while acknowledging differences, at least tear open the window paper³ and stop playing mysterious games.\n\nHowever, the female corpse remained unmoved, still lying there.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then reached his hand in and began to roam over the female corpse's body. He even desecrated some sensitive areas.\n\nHe only hoped that the female corpse would be unable to tolerate such \"improper advances\" and angrily open her eyes.\n\nAlas,\n\nthe female corpse remained coldly still, lying there,\n\nunmoved.\n\nZhou Ze figured that even if he actually took off his pants and got on her, the female corpse would still remain in this state.\n\nHe withdrew his hand, pursed his lips, unsure of what to do.\n\nYou can't wake up someone who's pretending to be asleep.\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze's fingernails began to grow long. Then, Zhou Ze stabbed his index fingernail into the female corpse's arm and slowly applied pressure.\n\n\"Pfft…\"\n\nHis fingernail, like a sharp blade, pierced into the female corpse's arm. No fresh blood flowed from the female corpse; instead, a cloud of black energy began to spread, instantly making the entire second-floor room eerily ghostly.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, what are you doing!\"\n\nXu Qinglang's shout came from downstairs.\n\nImmediately after, Xu Qinglang rushed up to the second floor, regardless of everything. Zhou Ze withdrew his hand at this moment. His fingernail seemed to be covered in a layer of frost, feeling a bit stiff and a little painful.\n\n\"Are you insane!\" Xu Qinglang looked at the narrow wound on the female corpse's arm and roared directly, \"Do you know that when a Hanba⁴ appears, it can scorch thousands of miles of land!\n\nThis female corpse certainly can't compare to a Hanba, but if the aura stored within her body leaks out, it's enough to spark an epidemic in Tongcheng!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to deal with the exasperated Xu Qinglang. Instead, he continued to stare at the female corpse's arm. The wound he had just made was slowly healing.\n\nThis female corpse,\n\nexcept for her body still being cold and having no breath, was truly no different from a living person in every other aspect. In fact, her body was even more active than that of a living person!\n\n\"Hey, this thing was unearthed by you and me together. If this thing causes any trouble, I'll get implicated, it'll shorten my lifespan, and even bring disaster upon my future descendants!\n\nThe same goes for you. If you blow things up, even if you're a Ghost Messenger now, you'll be in serious trouble.\"\n\nThe slight black energy that had just leaked from the female corpse slowly dissipated. Because the amount was small, and only Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were there—and their resistance was relatively strong—it wouldn't cause any harm.\n\nBut what had just leaked out was merely the tip of the iceberg of what was inside the female corpse.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, \"Xu Qinglang.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why don't you keep your 'wife' at your place? Didn't your parents just leave? Let her keep you company. After all, you married her with a proper eight-person sedan chair and a grand ceremony.\"\n\n\"What? What do you mean?\" Xu Qinglang was utterly bewildered.\n\n\"This thing, she can move on her own,\" Zhou Ze stated the reason. \"She went downstairs herself today and even drank some water.\"\n\nXu Qinglang's face also showed horror. His mouth twitched, and he took two steps back.\n\nLast night, he had mentioned that if this corpse had an accident, it would turn into a jiangshi.⁵ And not the weaklings in Western movies with silly heads who only know \"ugh ugh\" and can be easily headshotted, but a true jiangshi that lives off raw meat and blood and might even possess some supernatural powers.\n\n\"Thanks, I'm getting used to being alone.\"\n\nWhat a joke. How could Xu Qinglang take on this hot potato—no, this hot atomic bomb?\n\n\"Don't you have some talismans? Stick some on her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The talismans from my two swords would only have the opposite effect if I put them on her; they'd provoke her,\" Xu Qinglang said with a wry smile.\n\n\"Then what do we do?\" Zhou Ze felt a headache coming on. \"Transport her out to sea and dump her? Even if she turns into a jiangshi, at most she'll just go stir up trouble with the Dragon King of the Sea.\"\n\n\"She can't leave Tongcheng. She was a person of Tongcheng in life, and a ghost of Tongcheng in death. If her body leaves the Tongcheng area, she'll have problems. Otherwise, why didn't Madam Bai deal with her before achieving perfect merit and descending to the Underworld?\"\n\n*Slap!*\n\nZhou Ze slammed the freezer lid shut. Clearly, this problem was unsolvable.\n\nHe couldn't burn her,\n\nhe couldn't transport her,\n\nand he was afraid of accidents if he dumped her elsewhere.\n\nDid he just have to keep her in his room and take the risk of watching her?\n\nZhou Ze now seemed to somewhat understand why Little Loli had gone \"whoosh\" to hell. Being a civil servant in the Underworld wasn't so easy.\n\nEven within the system, those doing grassroots work were always the most miserable.\n\nJust like himself now.\n\n\"Look on the bright side. I'll make you more sour plum juice tonight,\" Xu Qinglang consoled him.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then I'm moving. Didn't I say I was going to open a shop in the county town below? I'm planning to move up my schedule.\" Xu Qinglang took on a \"better a dead fellow Taoist than a dead poor Taoist\"⁶ stance.\n\nAfter locking the freezer, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang went downstairs together.\n\nXu Qinglang again exhorted Zhou Ze not to mess around, then returned to his noodle shop. He had probably been busy with his own affairs, but sensing the leakage of baleful energy, he had been startled and rushed over.\n\nZhou Ze sat behind the counter,\n\nand swirled the glass of water in front of him.\n\nHis phone rang. He picked it up and saw it was an unknown number.\n\n\"Hello, may I speak to Mr. Xu Le? We're from the Chongchuan Traffic Police Department.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's me. What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Is Xu Dachuan a relative of yours? He was just in a car accident and is now being taken to People's Hospital.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll be right there.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes, letting out a dissatisfied hum. He was already annoyed enough, and now something else had come up. Xu Dachuan should be the elder uncle he had treated to lunch earlier.\n\nBut he couldn't *not* go. Although the man had specifically come to the city to visit Xu Le, not Zhou Ze, the local produce he had brought had all been given to Xu Qinglang for ingredients.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his fingernails.\n\nIf Xu Dachuan was truly in life-threatening danger,\n\nshould he save him or not?\n\nThe thought of the backlash and pain he had suffered last time after saving Little Loli sent a shiver down his spine. Never mind, he hoped the man wasn't seriously injured.\n\nHe walked out of the shop, hailed a taxi. In the car, Zhou Ze sent Xu Qinglang a WeChat message, telling him he was going out and asking him to watch the shop.\n\nBy the time he arrived at People's Hospital, it was already eight in the evening. Zhou Ze asked at the front desk and learned that Xu Dachuan was not in life-threatening danger and had already been moved to a ward. He felt relieved.\n\nPushing open the ward door, Zhou Ze stepped in and paused. He saw Dr. Lin standing by Xu Dachuan's bed, chatting with him.\n\nOne of Xu Dachuan's legs was propped up; it must have been fractured. He also had a few scrapes on his face, but his spirits were good. He was quite lively while chatting with his niece-in-law.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over, his gaze met Dr. Lin's.\n\n\"Thank you, I've troubled you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Dr. Lin stood up and explained, \"I wasn't home during the day, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nDr. Lin walked out of the ward. Zhou Ze stayed with his elder uncle for a bit longer. The long-distance bus had been in an accident before even leaving the city. Only Xu Dachuan had been unlucky, falling and fracturing his left leg. The other passengers only had minor scrapes.\n\nXu Dachuan didn't seem to care much about his injuries, instead repeatedly saying, \"My niece-in-law is still a good person.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, told Xu Dachuan to rest well, and then walked out of the ward.\n\nDr. Lin was standing by the front desk at this time. A female nurse was sitting there, seeming somewhat uncomfortable.\n\nZhou Ze was about to leave, but he felt he should say hello to Dr. Lin. They hadn't been in touch for a long time, but outward courtesy was still necessary.\n\nHowever, as he approached, Zhou Ze heard the faint cry of a baby, very weak, like a kitten.\n\nZhou Ze initially didn't think much of it, but as he got closer to Dr. Lin, the baby's cry became clearer.\n\nCould Dr. Lin have been possessed by a minor ghost?\n\nZhou Ze was still observing, deliberately standing behind Dr. Lin and looking.\n\n\"It's nothing, Sister Lin. I just have my usual digestive problems. I'll take some medicine later and be fine,\" the young nurse thanked Dr. Lin for her concern.\n\n\"Do take better care of yourself,\" Dr. Lin consoled her.\n\nAt this moment, Dr. Lin finally noticed Zhou Ze standing somewhat... \"sneaky\" behind her.\n\n\"You…\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Zhou Ze raised his hand, listened carefully again, and finally looked at the young nurse's stomach.\n\nThe sound wasn't coming from Dr. Lin; it was coming from inside the young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze, who had once been a doctor, immediately understood what was going on.\n\n\"You're pregnant,\" Zhou Ze told the young nurse. At this point, Zhou Ze couldn't afford to worry about subtlety or politeness.\n\n\"What?\" The young nurse looked bewildered.\n\n\"What nonsense are you spouting? Xiao Chen isn't even married and doesn't have a boyfriend,\" Dr. Lin glared at her \"husband.\"\n\n\"I don't know who you conceived with, but you should get checked out immediately. Also, I should warn you, you're at risk of miscarriage,\" Zhou Ze said with great certainty.\n\nThe fetus was very unstable. The indistinct crying sound symbolized the instinctive sadness of an unborn little one. This was also why Zhou Ze hadn't worried about the other party's feelings.\n\nHuman lives were at stake.\n\nNurse Xiao Chen sprang to her feet, a look of anxiety on her face. Clearly, she hadn't known she was pregnant before, but she knew she had engaged in \"high-risk\" behavior, making conception very likely.\n\nDr. Lin also understood and immediately rushed off with Xiao Chen.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, thinking it was a shame Xu Le had majored in civil engineering. If Xu Le had studied medicine, he figured he would soon become the most famous doctor not just in Tongcheng but throughout the entire Su Province.\n\nHe went downstairs, bought a carton of milk and some daily necessities for Xu Dachuan, took them to Xu Dachuan's ward, and then walked out. This time, he really intended to leave, as the one at home truly made him uneasy.\n\nCoincidentally, Dr. Lin stepped out of the elevator, her expression somewhat somber.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"How did you tell Xiao Chen was pregnant?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"I've studied some Traditional Chinese Medicine,\" Zhou Ze lied. \"How are things over there?\"\n\n\"Xiao Chen plans to keep the baby, but it's hard to say if she can. She hadn't been careful at all before,\" Dr. Lin said, then added to Zhou Ze, \"Are you heading back? Let me change, and I'll give you a ride.\"\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze rode out of the hospital in Dr. Lin's Cayenne.\n\nAlong the way, neither of them spoke much. Their \"marital\" relationship had plummeted to freezing point because of the last incident.\n\nAs they neared the bookstore, Zhou Ze felt he should find a topic to chat about, otherwise, it was truly too somber. So he said, \"You've posted quite a few Hanfu photos in your朋友圈 [Moments]. You like them a lot?\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\n\"I like them too,\" Zhou Ze touched the tip of his nose. \"Do you have any Hanfu? Could you wear some for me sometime?\"\n\nDr. Lin didn't answer, seemingly unwilling to engage in the topic.\n\nThe car stopped in front of the bookstore. Zhou Ze got out, and to his surprise, Dr. Lin also got out, seemingly intending to enter the bookstore with him.\n\nHeh, this woman was truly strong, not afraid of being... you know... by him again, like last time?\n\n\"I'm just getting a few magazines to read at work,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"Mmm,\" Zhou Ze nodded. He knew this was Dr. Lin indirectly expressing a desire for reconciliation. This woman was truly not easy.\n\nIn Lu Xun's style, it would be: This woman, once again bowed to feudal etiquette, that is, to this nominal \"husband.\"\n\nPushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze was somewhat surprised to find Xu Qinglang sitting on a plastic stool, reading a book. But the book in his hand was clearly upside down. What on earth was he reading?\n\nXu Qinglang awkwardly managed a smile at Zhou Ze, but it looked worse than a grimace.\n\nDr. Lin gave the man, who was prettier than most women, an extra look, then walked straight to the bookshelf to pick out magazines.\n\nZhou Ze handed Xu Qinglang a cigarette and whispered, \"What's wrong with you? You look out of your mind.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nfootsteps sounded from the stairwell. A woman in an ancient-style white dress gracefully descended from above, her figure elegant and naturally tender.\n\nWhen she saw Zhou Ze,\n\nshe gave a slight curtsy,\n\nand said very respectfully:\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\nThe magazine Dr. Lin had just taken into her hand,\n\nfell to the floor.\n\nAt the same time, she said coldly:\n\n\"It seems I don't need to wear it for you to see after all.\"\n***\n¹ **\"Tuck their tails between their legs and 'act human'\":** An idiom meaning to behave cautiously and submissively, especially for those in a vulnerable or potentially dangerous position.\n² **\"Right by his bed\":** A literal translation of \"臥榻之側\" (wò tà zhī cè), an idiom meaning \"in one's immediate vicinity\" or \"in one's own territory,\" often implying a threat or unwelcome presence too close for comfort.\n³ **\"Tear open the window paper\":** A literal translation of \"戳開窗戶紙\" (chuō kāi chuānghù zhǐ), an idiom meaning to reveal or clarify the truth, to stop pretending, or to make something obvious.\n⁴ **Hanba:** (旱魃) A drought demon or zombie-like creature in Chinese mythology.

    "content": "「It seems I don't need to put it on for you to see.」\n\nDr. Lin was indeed a very traditional woman, but not the kind from ancient times who dared not utter a word* if her husband took a concubine, for fear of being labeled jealous.\n\nShe had her compromises, and at the same time, her principles.\n\nShe could force herself to accept Zhou Ze's previous transgression against her, and she could also force herself to slowly accept \"Xu Le\" (Zhou Ze) as he became increasingly independent and dominant.\n\nBut she could not accept Zhou Ze having an affair; that was her bottom line.\n\nShe was very angry,\n\nextremely angry,\n\neven wanting to turn around and leave.\n\nAt the moment, the reason Dr. Lin hadn't left was that she was waiting for Zhou Ze's response. Regardless, Zhou Ze should give a clear stance, and then the matter between them could finally be resolved.\n\nEven if she had to go back and face her mother's accusations, and her father's rage over her marriage disgracing the family name, she would still accept it.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze did not respond.\n\nNo explanation,\n\nit seemed he was tacitly admitting it.\n\nThe light in Dr. Lin's eyes immediately dimmed,\n\nHe doesn't even need to explain anymore?\n\nIn truth, Dr. Lin had misunderstood Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze hadn't reacted at all at that moment, nor had he even noticed Dr. Lin's feelings.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, he felt as if the hairs on his back were standing on end from fright.\n\nThis female corpse,\n\nwas actually alive!\n\nAnd it wasn't as simple as her just coming down for a drink of water during the day; she had actually walked right up to him so openly, speaking and interacting with him!\n\nRecalling his \"fingertip tour\"* on her body earlier that day to \"wake her up,\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately had the urge to rush out of the shop and flee as far as possible.\n\nNow it made sense why Xu Qinglang was foolishly sitting there, holding a book upside down and reading it; he simply dared not move!\n\nThe scene fell into an awkward silence.\n\n「Hello.」 The female corpse smiled faintly. After greeting Zhou Ze, much like Korean or Japanese women greeting their husbands at the entrance upon their return home, she deliberately looked at Lin Wanqiu with an amused gaze.\n\n「Hello,」 Dr. Lin responded icily.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath at this moment. He reached out and pulled Xu Qinglang up, forcing him to stand.\n\n「Wanqiu, let me introduce you. This is my good friend and neighbor, the owner of the noodle shop next door, Xu Qinglang, who owns over twenty relocated properties!」\n\n「Hello,」 Xu Qinglang said to Lin Wanqiu, but his eyes remained fixed on the female corpse beside him.\n\nHe was truly utterly delicate and tender, like a startled little quail.\n\n「Hello,」 Lin Wanqiu.\n\n「This is...」 Zhou Ze pointed at the female corpse, 「Xu Qinglang's beloved.」\n\n「Yes... what?」 Xu Qinglang froze, but the next moment, Zhou Ze applied a little force, and Xu Qinglang stumbled, directly leaning against the female corpse.\n\n「Yes, this is my beloved. Her surname is Bai, and her name is Bai Su Z... Bai Susu.」 Xu Qinglang looked at Lin Wanqiu, while one hand casually, as if intimately, rested on the female corpse's shoulder.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nthe same icy sensation as last night directly stimulated his soul,\n\n「Ah... Oh oh oh oh... Huhu hu... Mmm...」\n\nAfter several consecutive shivers, Xu Qinglang released his hand and said, 「Haha, wifey, your body is so soft, I love touching it,\n\nHahahahaha!」\n\n「You two continue. Wanqiu, come out for a moment, I have something to tell you.」\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze directly took Lin Wanqiu's hand and, regardless of whether she was willing, pulled her out of the bookstore.\n\n「Oh, Xu Le, I suddenly remembered something very important I need to tell you, like how I have too many houses and want to give you one.」\n\nXu Qinglang waved a hand while making a show of wanting to follow Zhou Ze out.\n\nThe female corpse stood motionlessly at the side, dignified and serene.\n\nHowever, Xu Qinglang only felt a terrible chill directly encircling his neck, as if he would be instantly torn apart if he took another step outside.\n\nXu Qinglang wisely chose to stop, then let out a laugh:\n\n「Wifey, don't be angry, haha. How could houses be given away? We'll wait until the country allows twenty children, then we'll pass them all down to our kids. You'll even get a hero mother medal then.」\n\nXu Qinglang's face twisted in bitterness as he sat back down on the plastic stool.\n\nZhou Ze, holding Dr. Lin's hand, walked out of the bookstore and continued all the way to where Dr. Lin had parked her car by the roadside.\n\n「What's wrong? Tell me,」 Dr. Lin asked.\n\n「You seem to have gained some weight recently. Don't eat late-night snacks.」\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze pushed Dr. Lin towards her car,\n\n「Hurry and drive back. If you have nothing to do at night, go for a run or skip rope or something.」\n\n「What exactly is going on?」 Dr. Lin grabbed Zhou Ze, who was about to turn back to the bookstore.\n\n「Don't worry about it, just go,」 Zhou Ze urged.\n\nDr. Lin said no more. She got into her car, started the engine, cast one last deep glance at Zhou Ze, and then drove away.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath, then squatted by the roadside and lit a cigarette.\n\nHonestly, he didn't want to go back to the bookstore, and logic told him that leaving with Dr. Lin was the wisest choice. But there was nothing he could do; he had dug the female corpse out of that plot of land himself.\n\nZhou Ze didn't have a bleeding-heart attitude; he was actually very afraid of trouble. But no matter what, even disregarding his current temporary status as a ghost messenger, if the female corpse truly wreaked havoc and caused trouble in Tongcheng, his hometown, he would genuinely feel guilty.\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang, who was still in the bookstore,\n\nOh,\n\nXu Qinglang is still in the bookstore, I almost forgot.\n\nStill base, though,\n\neven dead,\n\nstill base.\n\nHe exhaled a smoke ring, tossed the cigarette butt on the ground, stepped on it firmly, and then Zhou Ze walked straight towards the bookstore.\n\nAs he pushed open the bookstore door, dark light began to swirl in Zhou Ze's eyes, and at the same time, his fingernails grew longer.\n\n「You're back again.」\n\nThe female corpse still stood there, graceful and beautiful, but the teasing glint in her eyes was even clearer than when Dr. Lin had been present.\n\n「Get back upstairs and lie down quietly!」\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the female corpse and rebuked her. Whether he could win or not, putting on a show* first was always worth it.\n\n「Do you prefer Durex or Jissbon? I have both. I'll go get them for you.」\n\nXu Qinglang said, again trying to stand up and walk out.\n\nHe regretted it,\n\nhe should have moved out during the day. Why was he still lingering here?\n\nHowever, the female corpse directly reached out and grabbed Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang let out a delicate shout from his throat: 「Heaven and Earth without Bounds, Profound Heart Righteous Law!」\n\nA bronze mirror appeared in Xu Qinglang's hand, pointed at the female corpse.\n\nHowever, in that instant, the bronze mirror shattered, and Xu Qinglang was swept away, crashing into the bookstore wall.\n\nThe might of the female corpse,\n\nwas truly terrifying!\n\nZhou Ze charged forward. This was his first proper fight, and he wasn't sure he could win.\n\nHowever, the female corpse's gaze specifically lingered on Zhou Ze's hands, then she began to retreat, not daring to take a single step forward.\n\n「Cough, cough...」\n\nXu Qinglang picked himself up from the floor, one hand supporting his waist. He had originally thought Zhou Ze would also be swept aside like him, but seeing Zhou Ze continuously force the female corpse backward, he immediately felt an imbalance in his heart,\n\n「Damn it, no holding back!」\n\nFinally, the female corpse was forced back to the wall, but the next moment, she finally became enraged and actively lunged at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze merely instinctively reached out and grabbed forward.\n\n「Wham!」\n\nWith a sharp crack,\n\nthe female corpse was slammed heavily against the wall, and the wall even dented slightly.\n\nThe white dress on the female corpse's chest, where she had rolled onto the ground, was torn open. Had she not been wearing undergarments, she would have been completely exposed.\n\n「Damn, so fierce!」 Xu Qinglang was dumbfounded at the side.\n\nAt the same time, the thought of his past self, who had actually planned to use force against Zhou Ze to extract the secret of how Zhou Ze could borrow a corpse to revive, immediately sent shivers down his spine.\n\nHis neighbor truly hadn't fought before. Xu Qinglang knew that Zhou Ze's previous fear and apprehension towards the female corpse were absolutely not an act,\n\nThe reason was simple:\n\nThis neighbor didn't even know he was so good at fighting!\n\nIndeed, Zhou Ze couldn't fight.\n\nGrowing up in the orphanage, it was very clean, and the children had good relationships, understanding how to be considerate and encourage each other. After growing up, he became a doctor, a job that saved lives. In his spare time, he had no interest in boxing or practicing free combat.\n\nTherefore,\n\nwhen Zhou Ze truly had to fight now, he himself felt a little clumsy.\n\nBecause the female ghost feared his fingernails, Zhou Ze's fighting style was like shrewish women clawing each other's faces with their nails, utterly devoid of a ghost messenger's bearing.\n\nCompared to the loli opening her mouth and murmuring, 「The Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,」 his gravitas* was far, far inferior.\n\nBut now, none of that was an issue. As long as it was effective, that was all that mattered.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, who had walked back earlier with the mindset of being torn apart by the female corpse, the current situation was truly wonderful.\n\n「Ah!」\n\nThe female corpse was sent flying again. Every time she got close to Zhou Ze's fingernails, the black aura on them would instantly pierce her body, causing immense damage.\n\n「Heaven and Earth without Bounds, Profound Heart Righteous Law!」\n\nTwo talismans appeared in Xu Qinglang's hand and were placed together on the ground. Immediately, the chill in the bookstore seemed to lessen somewhat, and each time the female corpse landed, the talismans would tremble, and the area beneath the female corpse would feel hot, as if a fire was burning.\n\nThe female corpse's gaze hardened. She dared not face Zhou Ze again, choosing instead to pierce through from the side. Her speed was swift, attempting to shatter the bookstore's glass door and escape.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was now getting more and more into the swing of things.\n\nAs the saying goes, even if you haven't eaten pork, haven't you at least heard the pig grunt?*\n\nFrom Hong Kong films in his childhood to later wuxia and xianxia films, he had seen plenty of their tricks and styles.\n\nZhou Ze held his hands horizontally, his dark eyes fixed on the doorway.\n\nWhen the female corpse attempted to smash through the glass door, streaks of black light suddenly appeared on the glass door, as if they were marks scraped by fingernails.\n\nThe female corpse let out a shrill scream, bounced back heavily, and landed on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stepped forward, simultaneously steadying his breathing.\n\nHowever, the female corpse, having been \"caught\" and brought back, directly prostrated herself on the ground, one hand pointing at Zhou Ze, the other covering her face,\n\n「Ying ying ying ying ying...*」\n\n「I'll beat you to death, you whimpering monster!*」\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out another talisman from his hand.\n\nBut the female corpse began pointing at Zhou Ze, crying with extreme grievance:\n\n「You touched me, and then you hit me! You're not human!」\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched subconsciously,\n\nThe female corpse, who had just brought immense pressure and deterrence to him and Xu Qinglang, suddenly acting this way indeed gave off a feeling that the art style had collapsed.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still said seriously and in a deep voice:\n\n「I am a ghost.」\n\n————————\n\nP.S.: Please vote with recommendation tickets, throw them all over here!

    "title": "Chapter 37: Life is But a Dream",
    "content": "「I merely wanted to tease Officer, why did Officer have to be so ruthless?\nOfficer truly is a heartless and faithless man. You touched me, you made light of me;\nAnd then you turned around and wouldn't admit it, even taking out your anger on me because of your original spouse.\"\n\nThe female corpse shed tears and murmured to herself, mournfully, sadly. Coupled with her white dress, now almost reduced to rags, she appeared even more pitiable.\n\nPeople often say that those who live to be seven or eight decades old almost become as cunning as foxes, but this female corpse before them had lived for two hundred years, having experienced the vicissitudes of life.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the female corpse's \"lament,\" turning his head instead to look at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Can she be killed?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"............\" The female corpse.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, then nodded.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The malevolent energy within her is a problem. If, at the last moment, she were to self-disintegrate and leak malevolent energy, it would definitely affect innocent people nearby,\" Xu Qinglang explained. \"That would be very troublesome.\"\n\n\"Mm-hm.\"\n\nThe female corpse assented. She had extinguished any thoughts of continuing to play the emotional card with Zhou Ze. The heartless one is the most unfaithful lover; clearly, Zhou Ze was already in her black book.\n\n\"But she wouldn't dare pull that trick either. Otherwise, her soul, already in Hell, would also suffer punishment if she were to commit anything against heaven and reason in the human world.\n\nSo, she can still be killed.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had a cigarette dangling from his mouth. Before, he had been as panicked as a quail about to be taken by force, but now with Zhou Ze, whose small universe had burst forth, by his side, he could watch the show and make sarcastic remarks.\n\n\"Don't kill me, don't kill me! She's her, I'm me, she and I are two different people.\"\n\nThe female corpse hastily cried out. She could tell that the two men before her genuinely wanted to resolve her once and for all.\n\nAny sentient being possesses the instinct for survival, and the female corpse was no exception.\n\nA thousand sails pass by the sunken boat, ten thousand trees blossom before the ailing tree;[^1]\n\nThe female corpse was actually not Madam Bai. To a certain extent, she was an independent life, the \"spiritual intelligence\" that had emerged from Madam Bai's flesh over two hundred years. However, the female corpse and Madam Bai still had countless intricate connections.\n\nXu Qinglang was right. The female corpse dared not do anything excessive in the human world. Even in death, she would not choose to act recklessly and cause Madam Bai in Hell to suffer punishment.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down in front of the female corpse. \"So what did you mean just now? Was it just for fun?\"\n\nThe female corpse nodded.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze chuckled twice. Thinking about it now, he was still a bit too \"young,\" having just become a ghost catcher with no experience, which was why he had agreed to Madam Bai's request.\n\n\"Is there no way to restrain her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Extract a wisp of her zombie soul-blood, and you can control her. But she has to be willing to give it to you proactively,\" Xu Qinglang suggested from the side.\n\nThe female corpse suddenly lifted her head, her eyes flashing with intense hatred, staring fixedly at Xu Qinglang, as if at that moment, Xu Qinglang was her greatest enemy.\n\n\"Either die, or hand over your soul-blood. You choose,\" Xu Qinglang said with a smile at the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"You... choose,\" Zhou Ze also looked at the female corpse. Clearly, he agreed with Xu Qinglang's suggestion.\n\nZhou Ze had mysophobia; he certainly didn't want the female corpse to inexplicably come down and clean his cup with her tongue again.\n\n\"Fine, I'll give it to you.\" The female corpse took a deep breath, as if to bury her resentment and anger at that moment. Then, she closed her eyes, and immediately, a wisp of something resembling a red earthworm extended from the center of her brow.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pinched the thing with his fingernails, then pulled it out and placed it in his palm. It was somewhat warm, somewhat damp, and slippery.\n\nAfter the female corpse handed over her soul-blood, her spirit immediately became extremely listless. She almost fainted, barely managing to stay upright.\n\n\"Go clean yourself up in the bathroom and then lie down upstairs. From today on, you are not allowed to step out of the bookstore without my permission,\" Zhou Ze warned.\n\n\"Yes, Officer.\" The female corpse lowered her head, adopting a very submissive posture. With her soul-blood controlled by the other party, she had no choice but to yield.\n\n............\n\n\"Clack.\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed the medicinal wine bottle onto the table. He was clearly applying medicinal wine to Xu Qinglang, but it sounded as if he were doing something utterly disgusting.\n\n\"Apply it yourself.\"\n\n\"Come on, now, you weren't hurt, but I was thrown against the wall, I have so many bruises all over me. Don't you have even a shred of pity?\" Xu Qinglang grew more agitated as he spoke, continuing, \"Zhou Ze, ever since you came here, have you noticed that I've been having bad luck?\"\n\n\"That's fate,\" Zhou Ze said, refusing to take the blame. \"By the way, that incantation you chanted just now, I keep feeling like it's very familiar.\"\n\n\"Heaven and Earth without Limit, Profound Heart Righteous Law.\"\n\n\"From a TV show. I thought it sounded good, so I used it. It actually doesn't help with spellcasting at all.\" Xu Qinglang was quite honest.\n\n\"So, it's like adding background music for yourself?\"\n\n\"Heh............\" Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes, picking up the medicinal wine himself and applying it. \"There's some plum juice in the kitchen; take it back. I won't open tomorrow morning; I need more rest.\"\n\n\"I'm going back to rest.\" Zhou Ze stood up, took the plum juice, and bid farewell. After returning to the bookstore, he went straight up to the second floor.\n\nThe female corpse obediently washed herself clean and lay down in the freezer, wearing Zhou Ze's clothes.\n\nThe white shirt was a bit large on her, hanging down and covering the curve of her upturned backside. She wore no pants, her legs crossed as she lay there, her eyes alluring.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and tapped the side of the freezer, saying, \"I remember Madam Bai said she died before she got married.\"\n\nTherefore, Madam Bai should, in theory, have been inexperienced, but the female corpse before him seemed a little fickle and flirtatious.\n\n\"That's because she didn't tell you that before her marriage, she committed adultery with a penniless scholar, was discovered by her father who felt it disgraced the family, and was then forcibly drowned.\"\n\n\"Oh, so, she was an experienced hand?\"\n\n\"That's right. Do you know how much effort and care she expended to make me not look as terrifying as a drowned person?\"\n\n\"Women, after all, love beauty.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Sleep.\"\n\nHaving said that, Zhou Ze placed a pillow by the freezer and lay down.\n\nWith the female corpse beside him, the chill emanating from her made him feel very comfortable, more so than lying inside the freezer.\n\nHe slept very soundly. When he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze opened his eyes to see a pair of long legs slowly swaying before him, even the curve of the instep was just right.\n\nIf only she wore stockings or high heels...\n\nAnd when facing the female corpse, Zhou Ze could actually let loose more.\n\nNeither of them was human, so there was no need for hypocritical pretense; instead, it was purer.\n\n\"If you can't hold back, I can lie down. I know you really want to do *that* kind of thing.\n\nHolding it in for too long isn't good, especially since your body isn't original; otherwise, problems could truly arise, you know.\"\n\nThe female corpse said generously, and smiled, adding, \"Don't worry, I won't get pregnant.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked downstairs to wash up, then began cooking instant noodles. After everything was ready, Zhou Ze took out the plum juice and, with great difficulty, completed his morning meal task with the noodles.\n\n\"It must be painful, eating human food.\" The female corpse sat on the stair step, her face turned to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\n\"You're clearly already dead, yet you insist on living like a human. Don't you get tired?\"\n\n\"You're talking a bit much,\" Zhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\n\"You said yesterday I'm not allowed to leave the bookstore, so what else can I do besides talk to you?\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the mop and broom from behind the counter and tossed them all to the female corpse.\n\n\"Clean.\"\n\n....................\n\nThe sun was bright today. The female corpse knelt on the bookstore's tile floor, wiping it with a rag, while Zhou Ze moved a plastic stool outside the shop and sat there, basking in the sun.\n\nIt wasn't until noon that Xu Qinglang opened his shop door and walked out. He took a cigarette from Zhou Ze, glanced at the scene inside the shop, and chuckled:\n\n\"Well trained, aren't you?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to squint, enjoying the sunlight.\n\nXu Qinglang exhaled a smoke ring, then, as if something occurred to him, said:\n\n\"Your signboard is well made, quite classy. It makes me next door look shabby by comparison. I'm also planning to get a custom signboard.\"\n\n\"Aping refinement?\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"Why not?\" Xu Qinglang raised an eyebrow. \"If I put out my twenty-some property deeds, who could say I'm not refined?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"Come on, help me brainstorm a bit. I think your 'Listen to it casually, thus have I heard' is pretty good.[^2] I plan for the horizontal scroll of my signboard couplet to be 'Life is but a dream.' How's that? Sounds stylish, right?\n\nBut for the couplet, I think it'd be best to have something related to 'eating,' so it fits my restaurant, right?\n\nI haven't thought of anything good. Do you have any suggestions?\"\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment. \"Do you really want to hear it?\"\n\n\"Just say it,\" Xu Qinglang urged.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the female corpse inside the room, and said:\n\n\"Men eat earth their whole lives,\nEarth eats men back once.\nHorizontal scroll,\nLife is but a dream.\"\n___\n[^1]: This is a line from the Tang Dynasty poem \"Given to Liu Yuxi\" (酬樂天揚州初逢席上見贈) by Liu Yuxi (劉禹錫), signifying that new things will replace the old, and life continues despite setbacks.\n[^2]: This phrase combines two literary references: \"Listen to it casually\" (姑妄聽之), from Zhuangzi, meaning to listen without taking it too seriously or critically; and \"thus have I heard\" (如是我聞), a common opening phrase for Buddhist sutras, indicating the content is an account or teaching that was heard by the transcriber. Together, it suggests an attitude of presenting or receiving stories that might not be factually verified but are simply conveyed as heard.",

    "title": "Chapter 38: The Infant Speaks",
    "content": "「Here, have a taste, the new version of Sour Sis Juice*。」\n\nXu Qinglang placed a cup on Zhou Ze’s counter. This plum juice looked richer in color than before. He swirled it in his hand, as if holding a glass of wine.\n\n「What’s different？」Zhou Ze asked without drinking it first.\n\n「The flavor is richer, a bit like aged yellow wine. The kick comes later. It’ll keep you from wolfing down your food like before, improving your life’s happiness index.」\n\n「Heh, hanky-panky.」\n\nThe female corpse, who was organizing the bookshelf nearby, let out a sour scoff.\n\nZhou Ze took a sip. Unlike the plum juice he had before, this one was somewhat crisp and refreshing, leaving a sweet aftertaste. The flavor was very good.\n\nHowever, it didn’t seem to be the sensation he was looking for.\n\nBut just after tasting it for a moment, Zhou Ze felt a sharp, sour twisting in his stomach.\n\n「A sharp gasp...」\n\nHis body also began to tremble uncontrollably.\n\nThat lingering sourness,\n\nSo domineering.\n\nHis fingers curled slightly, then slowly uncurled. Zhou Ze nodded, very satisfied.\n\n「You’ve put thought into this,」Zhou Ze said.\n\n「Don’t mention it.」Xu Qinglang smiled faintly. 「I plan to make this one of my signature side dishes. It’s just a shame that people who like this flavor are probably quite few.」\n\n「Mm.」Zhou Ze agreed with that.\n\n「Creak.」\n\nThe bookstore door creaked open, and a group of students entered. There were quite a few, seven or eight of them, all looking like the goody-two-shoes type.\n\n「Boss, what’s the Wi-Fi password？」a girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the wall; it was written there.\n\n「Phew...」\n\nThe students all found plastic stools and sat down. Then, the girl took out some homework from her backpack, distributing it for the others to copy.\n\nWith the winter break about to end, this was a rather normal sight.\n\nZhou Ze naturally wouldn’t be so bored as to go lecture these children on the meaning of learning and the downsides of copying others’ homework. He tapped the counter with his hand, and the female corpse, understanding, came over to pour Zhou Ze a cup of warm water.\n\nThe leading girl, at this moment, walked to the bookshelf, casually flipping through books. After selecting a few, she walked to Zhou Ze. 「How much？」\n\n「Ninety-five,」Zhou Ze replied.\n\n「Here, keep the change.」\n\nThe girl was very generous, tossing down a hundred-yuan bill.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and said nothing more.\n\nBy around five in the afternoon, this group of students had finished copying their homework and left. The bookstore returned to its usual quietness.\n\nXu Qinglang wasn’t in the shop; he had gone to custom-order a signboard. Of course, he wouldn’t order the one Zhou Ze suggested:\n\n「Man eats soil his whole life, soil eats man once」kind of signboard,\n\nbecause anyone with a normal brain could tell that signboard wasn’t suitable for a dining place; it was more fitting for the sides of a grave.\n\nThe female corpse, however, was quite efficient in her work. She had cleaned both the first and second floors today, and apart from occasionally preening and showing off her charms, there were basically no other flaws.\n\nShe didn’t say where she was going, and Zhou Ze didn’t ask.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze remembered Madam Bai’s reminder: 「Next Han Yi Festival**, burn the corpse with bamboo and wood.」\n\nZhou Ze wasn’t sure if Madam Bai knew that her corpse had actually developed sentience long ago.\n\nIf she knew, yet still entrusted it to him, and at the same time told him how and when to burn her, what was the meaning of that？\n\nLast night, the female corpse also admitted that even if Zhou Ze killed her, she wouldn’t dissolve herself and let the malevolent energy leak out, thereby implicating Madam Bai in hell.\n\nHowever,\n\nMadam Bai seemed to simply want to cleanly get rid of this trouble.\n\nFrom this perspective,\n\nthis female corpse, whom he treated as a maid,\n\nwas actually a pitiable person.\n\n「What’s your name？」Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「My surname is Bai,」the female corpse replied.\n\n「Bai what？」\n\n「Bai Yingying.」\n\n「Bai Yīngyīng***？」\n\nZhou Ze nodded. 「This name is a bit strange.」\n\n「Actually, you don’t have to struggle so much with eating,」the female corpse said, stretching, her impressive figure accentuated. 「It’s just like how you can sleep very soundly if you sleep with me.」\n\n「Your soul is tainted by the aura of hell, but your body is still that of a living person.」\n\n「You need sleep and food to replenish your physical body, but your soul doesn’t need these things, which is why it instinctively repels and rejects them.」\n\n「Go on.」\n\n「I can feed you from now on,」the female corpse said with a shy smile. 「Food, after passing through my mouth and carrying my fluids,」\n\n「will carry the aura of a ghostly entity. When you eat it then, you won’t feel so uncomfortable.」\n\nZhou Ze suddenly understood why that cup of water had tasted sweet last time. It wasn’t because the female corpse’s mouth was sweet, but because of this reason.\n\n「Thank you.」\n\n「Don’t mention it.」\n\nOutside the shop door, a man in a leather jacket approached. His clothes were a bit rustic, his hair disheveled, and his face was flushed, suggesting he had just been drinking.\n\nThe man circled outside twice before finally pushing open the door and entering the bookstore.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn’t pay attention, but soon, his gaze slightly sharpened.\n\nHe knew this man.\n\nSun Tao, his former assistant, a... very promising young doctor.\n\nThe female corpse’s gaze also sharpened slightly. She reached out and gently poked Zhou Ze’s waist, saying softly:\n\n「Superior, um, can I eat that？」\n\n「Eat a person？」\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\n「Superior, didn’t you notice, on that person’s back.」\n\nWith that reminder, Zhou Ze finally stood up and looked. Hanging on the man’s back was a dark, shapeless thing.\n\nAn ordinary person might not know what it was, as it indeed looked somewhat abstract, a bit like a black worm, yet it also had some special human-like features.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, due to his former profession, recognized it at a glance—a premature infant.\n\n「Wuwuwu... wuwuwu...」\n\nPerhaps because Zhou Ze had noticed him, the infant let out a faint crying sound.\n\nThis sound was somewhat familiar. Zhou Ze’s mind began searching through related memories, and finally, he found the familiar source.\n\nNurse Chen.\n\nMore precisely, it was the sound once emitted from Nurse Chen’s belly, though at that time, only Zhou Ze could hear it.\n\nZhou Ze felt no secret joy that he could still perform 「paternity tests」,\n\nonly sorrow welled up in his heart.\n\nThat child, was it still not saved？\n\nThe female corpse said she wanted to eat him, not referring to the person, but to the soul of that male infant.\n\nZhou Ze shot her a glare. The female corpse pouted, not daring to say anything more, only grudgingly swallowing her saliva nearby. At the same time, she very aggrievedly reached out and adjusted the heavy weight on her chest:\n\n「I don’t eat living people’s food, and every night I’m picked clean of malevolent energy by you like a furnace top.」\n\n「If I don’t supplement myself, this will all shrivel up, and then you won’t be able to peek at me while I work.」\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily stunned. She had been observing his gaze all along？\n\n「You rascal.」the female corpse said teasingly.\n\n「Boss, do you have alcohol？」Sun Tao called out.\n\n「Go next door,」Zhou Ze replied, but still stood up and poured him a glass of water.\n\nAfter all, Sun Tao was a junior he had once mentored. Zhou Ze had grown up in an orphanage, while Sun Tao had grown up in a single-parent family. Back then, Zhou Ze had even disregarded fanatical admirers like Doctor Lin, yet he had taken great care of this junior named Sun Tao.\n\nNothing more than that, just because their personalities were very similar. Their childhood experiences had made them understand the meaning of struggle and effort even more deeply, both wanting to live and strive to make something of themselves.\n\n「Pfft... hahahahaha...」Sun Tao took the water, drank a large gulp, and then burst into laughter. 「Boss, why are you looking at me like that？ I’m not interested in men.」\n\n「Oh,」Zhou Ze responded.\n\n「With such a handsome man living next door, I wouldn’t be interested in you.」\n\nSun Tao sat down on a plastic stool, bit his lip, then shook his head.\n\n「Boss, do you have children？」\n\n「We’re not ready for them yet; he thinks I’m too young,」the female corpse interjected from the side, desperately trying to add to her role.\n\nSun Tao looked up at the female corpse. Although her figure was very full and she was tall, she looked to be only high school age. He immediately laughed:\n\n「You are indeed still young.」\n\nThe female corpse turned her face away indignantly, then swallowed another gulp of saliva.\n\n「I originally had a child,」Sun Tao said with a hint of emotion.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say, you do have a child; your child is hanging on your back.\n\nWith the development of modern medicine and the 「modernization」 of people’s thinking, abortion and induced miscarriage are no longer such jarring terms. However, few realize that the resentment of unborn infants, those who never had a chance to be born, is actually the strongest.\n\nThese types of infants who died prematurely are also the most likely to become ghostly entities. Of course, their ability to take revenge is actually very weak.\n\nAt most, driven by resentment, they will cling to their so-called parents for a period, and then disperse on their own.\n\nThe female corpse said she wanted to eat him because these types of infants, not having been fully born, were like ungerminated seeds. For entities like the female corpse, their 「nutritional value」 was extremely high.\n\n「What happened？」Zhou Ze asked. 「Your girlfriend didn’t agree？」\n\nZhou Ze remembered that although Nurse Chen was very uneasy and astonished at the time, she had said she would keep the child.\n\n「No, she was willing, but I wasn’t. I chickened out. I told her to abort the child.」\n\nFor some reason, Sun Tao really wanted to talk to this bookstore owner. In him, he found a familiar big-brotherly feeling.\n\nAnd that big brother had passed away more than half a year ago.\n\n「Chickened out？」Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Her parents originally looked down on me, heh heh. Their family is very well-off.」Sun Tao lifted his head, seemingly trying to hold back his tears.\n\n「But what’s done is done,」Zhou Ze said.\n\n「But I wasn’t willing to use such a thing to coerce their family. I didn’t want my colleagues, my friends, to think I used such means to get into their household；」\n\n「I didn’t want others to think I was a Phoenix Man****.」\n\n「I didn’t covet their family’s money, nor anything else.」\n\n「I didn’t want to get married and then have a pair of in-laws looking down on me, or even their whole extended family.」\n\n「I grew up in a single-parent family, so I understand even more deeply that dignity is earned by one’s own hands.」\n\n「Even if she was willing？」\n\n「Her willingness was her willingness, but I wasn’t willing. I wanted to live with dignity.」\n\n「Heh heh, when I first started in this profession, an old big brother told me that dignity and others’ attitudes towards you are earned by your own hands. I haven’t achieved success yet, so, I didn’t want to...」\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then asked: 「Did that big brother of yours tell you one more thing？」\n\n「What？」Sun Tao asked, surprised.\n\n「That is, when you’re enjoying yourself, don’t forget to wear a... condom.」\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze directly swung his fist and smashed it into Sun Tao’s face.\n\n「Thud！」\n\nSun Tao inexplicably took a heavy punch, falling to the ground, his face blank with confusion.\n\n「Don’t make excuses, don’t talk about dignity, don’t say anything else,」\n\n「You are selfish, completely and utterly selfish.」\n\nAfter saying that,\n\nZhou Ze delivered another kick to Sun Tao, who was still on the ground.\n\n「Thud！」\n\nSun Tao curled up, in great pain and also drunk, but still shouted angrily:\n\n「Are you sick？ Hitting people！」\n\n「Yes, I am sick. I was blind as a bat back then, thinking of nurturing and helping you out！」\n\nJust then,\n\nthe coiled mass that was originally hanging on Sun Tao’s shoulder crawled to Zhou Ze’s front,\n\nemitting 「squeaking」 sounds from its mouth,\n\nThe female corpse heard it,\n\nZhou Ze also heard it,\n\nbut Sun Tao couldn’t hear it,\n\nhis unborn child, who had never truly seen this world,\n\nat this moment actually bared its teeth,\n\ntowards the person who hit its father,\n\nlet out an angry cry...\n\n---\n*「酸妹汁」 (suān mèi zhī) literally translates to \"sour girl juice,\" a playful, slightly sarcastic name for plum juice (酸梅汁), implying its intense sourness.\n**「寒衣節」 (Hán Yī Jié) is the Traditional Chinese Winter Clothing Festival, a day for remembering the deceased and offering them \"winter clothes\" (paper offerings). It typically falls on the 1st day of the 10th lunar month.\n***「鶯」 (yīng) means oriole; 「嚶」 (yīng) refers to the sound of humming or whimpering, often used humorously or ironically to describe someone overly delicate or cutesy. Zhou Ze is either mishearing or playfully misinterpreting.\n****「鳳凰男」 (fènghuángnán), or \"Phoenix Man,\" refers to a man from a poor, rural background who achieves success through education and hard work, often with family sacrifices. The term can carry negative connotations, implying a struggle to integrate into urban, middle-class life, or a perception of using marriage for upward mobility.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze sat down, no longer hitting anyone. Indeed, he really had no reason to hit anyone; whether or not to have children was their own freedom, a power they could wield.\n\nMoreover,\nnow, even the sole victim\ndidn't want to strike a blow himself.\n\n\"Heh…\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\nSun Tao scrambled up from the ground, pointing at Zhou Ze and shouting, \"Are you crazy? I'm calling the police, I'm going to get an injury report!\"\n\n\"You deserved it,\" Zhou Ze said, blowing out a smoke ring without lifting his head.\n\n\"You... you... you...\" Sun Tao pointed at Zhou Ze, then pushed open the bookstore door and walked out. He cursed his bad luck, wondering why on earth he'd inexplicably come to this bookstore today.\n\nThe infant still tried to follow him out, but Zhou Ze grabbed it.\n\nThe infant struggled, clearly displeased, but Zhou Ze ignored its reaction, still holding it down on the ground.\n\n\"What are you still following for?\" Zhou Ze said. \"If you keep following, you won't even have a chance in your next life.\"\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak…\"\n\nThe infant was still struggling, simply incapable of heeding Zhou Ze's words.\n\n\"Excellency.\"¹ The female zombie leaned close to Zhou Ze, casting a suggestive look, clearly trying to curry favor. She evidently thought Zhou Ze was keeping the infant to supplement her.\n\nRight?\nMost men have a 'cultivation' fantasy.\n\nThe female zombie felt she was perfect for it,\nwhether in terms of age or figure.\n\n\"Excellency... mmm... uhm... mmm... Boss... uhm... mmm... mmm…\"\n\nThe female zombie swayed her figure, shaking just enough.\n\nHer mind yearned for calm, but her body refused to obey;²\nit was quite a spectacle.\n\n\"This body can still keep growing, you know, as long as I get enough nutrition.\"\n\n\"Get lost.\"\n\n\"…………\" The female zombie.\n\n\"Help me keep an eye on him, don't let him run,\" Zhou Ze said, standing up expressionlessly. \"If you secretly eat him, you'll die too.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\nThe female zombie could only squat down and grab the infant with both hands.\n\n\"Boss, he won't call the police, will he?\" The female zombie was afraid of trouble.\n\n\"No, people like him won't make such a fuss that the whole world knows he got drunk and was beaten.\"\n\n\"Heh, a slave to appearances,\" the female zombie said disdainfully.\n\nZhou Ze actually didn't say one thing: that guy's personality was actually like his own in the past.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the palm of his right hand, slowly closed his eyes, silently recited something in his heart, then opened his eyes again.\n\nHmm,\nnothing happened.\n\nNext, Zhou Ze squatted down, stretched out his palm, and extended it towards the infant.\n\nHmm,\nstill nothing happened.\n\nThe female zombie holding the infant nearby was at first baffled, but quickly realized what Zhou Ze was trying to do, then her body trembled slightly, suppressing laughter.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the female zombie. \"If you can't hold it in, then don't.\"\n\nYes, Zhou Ze himself had to give a wry smile.\n\nThe little girl said she'd put the key to the gates of Hell in his hand, yet when he first intended to open them and send a ghost in, he didn't know how to open them.\n\nIn any case, the little girl probably wouldn't just be playing a joke on him by simply imprinting something like a tattoo on his hand.\n\n\"Hahahahahahaha... How could this humble servant possibly laugh at you, Boss... Hahahahaha... This humble servant wouldn't dare disrespect the Boss... Hahaha-ha.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Zhou Ze asked, \"do you know how to open it?\"\n\nThe female zombie shook her head. \"Boss, I really don't know this one. Or, is there some incantation?\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze silently recalled the scene Xu Qinglang had described to him, when the little girl reclaimed his parents' departed souls.\n\nImmediately, he spread open his hand and said in a deep voice:\n\n\"The Underworld has order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed.\"\n\n\"Whoosh…\"\n\nOutside the glass door, withered yellow leaves blew past,\nand it seemed a crow cawed \"Caw... caw... caw\" as it flew away;\nInside the bookstore, it was still quiet.\n\nIn short, there was still no reaction.\n\n\"Or, try a different incantation?\" the female zombie suggested. \"Everyone has one that suits them, right?\"\n\n\"Are you suggesting I shout 'Open Sesame'?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"That depends on what 'position' you prefer, Boss.\"³\n\nThe female zombie looked utterly guileless.\n\nZhou Ze recalled that during the fight that night, Xu Qinglang had also shouted the incantation \"Heaven and Earth boundless, Profound Heart Righteous Law,\" then produced talismans and a bronze mirror;\n\nBut afterwards, just as Xu Qinglang said, that was just because he'd seen it in a TV show before and thought those two lines sounded very impressive, so he applied them—similar to the BGM when the protagonist appears in a movie.\n\nActually, now that he thought about it, perhaps the phrase \"The Underworld has order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed\" that the little girl said with her mouth open and tongue sticking out was also similar, just to add to the 'cool factor'.⁴\n\nIt seemed the little girl had no difference from Xu Qinglang in terms of humor, even though she was a seasoned ghost official.\n\nZhou Ze's mind stirred, and the fingernail on his left index finger began to lengthen.\n\nThe female zombie revealed a look of fear; she feared Zhou Ze, and what she feared most were Zhou Ze's fingernails, for on them was an aura that terrified her.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze himself somewhat suspicious that the old man who had died in front of him back then might not have been so simple after all.\n\nStowaways also fell into two categories: one type was like his former self, who had to live with his tail between his legs;⁵ the other type was like the one in Rongcheng mentioned by the little girl, who caused so much trouble that even the ghost officials found him difficult and thorny to deal with.\n\nIn short, the old man who infected him with grey nail fungus shouldn't have been so simple.\n\nThe black fingernail pierced the mark on Zhou Ze's right palm; immediately after, when Zhou Ze pulled his fingernail out, a black thread was pulled out by Zhou Ze.\n\nLike hot caramel, it was very viscous, yet didn't break.\n\nThe pulled-out thread was drawn into a square by Zhou Ze,\nimmediately,\nthe square floated up,\nand its inside began to turn black, empty and vast, as gusts of ghostly wind began to blow out.\n\nThe infant in the female zombie's hands began to struggle; clearly, it didn't want to return to Hell.\n\nWhen a person dies, it's like a lamp goes out,⁶\nbut few people can truly accept it.\n\nHow many people, seventy or eighty years old, or even those who have committed heinous acts and countless bad deeds their whole lives, still desperately cling to life⁷—let alone this little infant.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew clearly that sending it into Hell, to anticipate a new beginning and reincarnation, was the most correct choice.\n\nThere was no need to ask for its opinion; at this moment, Zhou Ze appeared very overbearing. He directly grabbed the infant from the female zombie and then directly threw it into this pitch-black square.\n\nAfterward, the square slowly dissipated, and a faint burnt smell permeated the air.\n\nThe female zombie stuck out her tongue and said nothing.\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, was somewhat lost in thought. After all, this was his first time sending a ghost back to Hell; even the last time, with the woman who wished to accompany her son through the college entrance exam, Zhou Ze hadn't done this.\n\n\"Hell, have you been there?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No,\" the female zombie answered honestly. \"And I can't go down there.\"\n\nThe female zombie had no soul of her own,\nZombies do not enter the Five Elements, nor do they fall into human reincarnation.\n\nThis sounded quite impressive,\nbut a line needed to be added afterwards:\nHated by humans, loathed by ghosts, abandoned by heaven!\n\nThis meant if the female zombie went out for a stroll with nothing to do, there was also a certain probability that a dry thunderclap would strike her in broad daylight and she'd instantly turn to ash.\n\nThis world, to her, was just that unfriendly.\n\nHumans have the Human Realm,\nGhosts have Hell,\nAn existence that belongs to neither is an anomaly.\n\nZhou Ze sat back behind the counter. He didn't feel happy, only somewhat dull and bored.\n\nIf the Human Realm were likened to a production line, then what he was doing was nothing more than throwing scrapped products into an incinerator for remanufacturing.\n\n\"Boss, here's a stack of these.\"\n\nThe female zombie picked up a few sheets of joss paper money from the tile floor and handed them to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised; he hadn't expected there would be payment this time too.\n\n\"It's easier to deal with the King of Hell than with a petty devil.\"⁸ The female zombie regretted it somewhat after saying this, but still bit the bullet and said, \"Ghost officials escorting people on their way and exacting a toll⁹ is fundamentally part of the expected meaning of the situation. Presumably, his mother must have burned joss paper money for him before.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took the joss paper money, and placed it with the remaining joss paper money in the drawer behind his counter. Even with these few added, it was still a bit meager.\n\n\"Do you know any other friends? Introduce some business for me to do. To be a human... oh no, to be a ghost, one also needs to study more to progress better.\"\n\n\"Boss, this humble servant only knows some lonely wandering spirits; they've long since lost their incense offerings, so they have no money at all. And they wouldn't dare approach you; if they were taken by you, wouldn't that just be giving you free 'performance'?\"\n\n\"'Performance'?\" Zhou Ze was hearing this for the first time. \"Being a ghost official has 'performance' too?\"\n\n\"Isn't there?\" the female zombie asked, somewhat confused.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zhou Ze shrugged. He really didn't know, because the little girl had just left him with one line—\"You're the most self-aware person¹⁰ I've ever seen\"—and then:\nBiu,\nand then she was gone.\n\nShe didn't leave him with a *Ghost Official's Code of Conduct* or *How to be a Ghost Official with Ideals, Drive, and Aspirations*.\n\n\"Presumably, there should be,\" the female zombie said, looking a bit troubled. \"Just like my mistress back home: lingering in the Human Realm for two hundred years, protecting the local area, diligent and conscientious, she was merely hoping to atone for her previous sin of lingering after returning to Hell, and at the same time, secure an official position. If her temple hadn't been destroyed back then, and her incense offerings were still active, it wouldn't have taken her so long.\"\n\n\"Do you know any other ghost officials?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"How could this humble servant possibly know so many Excellencies?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded. It seemed he'd have to ask someone in the know later.\n\nJust then, the sound of an electric scooter came from outside; it was Xu Qinglang returning.\n\n\"Oh my, I'm dead tired.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the bookstore and tossed a cigarette to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Weren't you going to order the signboard?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"That's ordered,\" Xu Qinglang replied. \"Then I picked up a batch of goods on the way; Wanchai Ferry had a special offer recently, so I stocked up on a lot. It exhausted me.\"\n\n\"Aren't your dumplings freshly made?\"\n\n\"Heh heh,\" Xu Qinglang chuckled, \"the cola at fast-food restaurants is still bought from the supermarket next door and then resold; how could I have the free time to make dumplings at home every day?\"\n\n\"Wanchai Ferry, quite fitting for you.\"\n\n\"Right? I like that flavor too... Hey, no more talking, I'm going back to put things in the fridge first.\" Xu Qinglang waved to Zhou Ze and went back to his own shop.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang left, the female zombie suddenly snickered.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. \"You understood?\"\n\nThe female zombie smiled and said:\n\"He certainly is handsome; most men who are with him would probably turn gay, right?¹¹\n\nSo,\nWan Zai Ma Tou.\"¹¹\n\n______\nPS: Given that since the book's release, readers in the comment section often leave messages saying 'The author copied *He Comes From Hell*' or 'The author's beginning is very similar to *He Comes From Hell*,' Dragon will give a unified reply:\n*He Comes From Hell* was written by Dragon.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ **Excellency (上差, *shàngchāi*)**: A respectful term for a superior official, especially in a supernatural context like a ghost official.\n² **Her mind yearned for calm, but her body refused to obey (人慾靜而肉不止, *rén yù jìng ér ròu bù zhǐ*)**: A humorous twist on the classical idiom \"人欲靜而風不止\" (rén yù jìng ér fēng bù zhǐ), meaning \"the tree desires stillness, but the wind won't stop.\" Here, \"flesh\" replaces \"wind,\" implying her body's natural jiggling or seductive movements.\n³ **\"position\" (體位, *tǐwèi*)**: Literally \"body position,\" often used informally to refer to sexual positions.\n⁴ **cool factor (B格, *B gé*)**: Internet slang derived from \"B-grade,\" meaning \"coolness factor\" or \"swagger.\"\n⁵ **live with his tail between his legs (夾著尾巴做人, *jiā zhe wěi bā zuò rén*)**: An idiom meaning to live cautiously, timidly, or in a cowed manner.\n⁶ **When a person dies, it's like a lamp goes out (人死如燈滅, *rén sǐ rú dēng miè*)**: An idiom meaning death is the complete end, with nothing remaining.\n⁷ **desperately cling to life (舔活著, *tiǎn huózhe*)**: Colloquial, literally \"licking to live,\" meaning to cling to life desperately, often implying a pathetic or undignified struggle.\n⁸ **It's easier to deal with the King of Hell than with a petty devil (閻王好見，小鬼難纏, *Yánwáng hǎo jiàn, xiǎoguǐ nán chán*)**: An idiom meaning minor officials can be more troublesome or demanding than high-ranking ones.\n⁹ **exacting a toll (過路扒皮, *guò lù bā pí*)**: An idiom that literally means \"flaying skin while passing by,\" referring to extortion or demanding bribes or fees from travelers.\n¹⁰ **self-aware (最有逼數的, *zuì yǒu bī shù de*)**: Internet slang, literally \"most B-shù,\" meaning most aware of one's own capabilities, limitations, or general situation, often used humorously or ironically.\n¹¹ **Wanchai Ferry (灣仔碼頭, *Wān Zǎi Mǎ Tóu*) / Wan Zai Ma Tou (彎仔碼頭, *Wān Zǎi Mǎ Tóu*)**: This is a pun. \"Wanchai Ferry\" is a well-known brand of frozen dumplings. The female zombie uses a homophone: \"彎仔\" (*wān zǎi*), which means \"bent boy\" and is slang for \"gay.\" So, \"彎仔碼頭\" (*wān zǎi mǎ tóu*) playfully means \"gay boy pier,\" implying that being handsome like Xu Qinglang would make others \"bend\" (turn gay).",

    "title": "Chapter 40: Night Parade of a Hundred Demons",
    "content": "In recent years, Tongcheng has gained some fame, not for its economy, nor for its snacks, but for its college entrance examination.\n\nFor most senior high school students across the country, Tongcheng's mock exam papers are comparable to Huanggang's \"Secret Scrolls.\"\n\nOf course, originally, these matters had no impact on Zhou Ze. His bookstore had long since shed its reliance on \"business with the living,\"\n\nhaving completed an industrial upgrade and transformation, now making money from the dead.\n\nHowever, Fatty, who had visited him last time, found him again.\n\nThe goal was simple: the next semester was the college entrance examination semester, and Fatty planned to do something big again – a pirated \"Secret Scrolls\" business.\n\nThere must have been many complications involved, even an extremely intricate chain of interests, which Zhou Ze wasn't very clear about. In fact, Zhou Ze believed Xu Le wouldn't be clear either.\n\nThe reason Fatty wanted to rope Xu Le in both last time and this time was entirely to leverage Xu Le's network of classmates.\n\nXu Le, in this regard, was actually a middleman satisfactory to both parties.\n\nFoolishly naive,\n\nyet the most reassuring.\n\nPiracy is an unavoidable hurdle in current domestic social life. Even the so-called \"shanzhai culture\"<sup>1</sup> derived from it, appearing vigorous and in full swing, has gradually begun to shed its pejorative connotation and move towards becoming a neutral term.\n\nBut after all is said and done, it is ultimately illegal. Although the prevailing trend makes this phenomenon almost universally rampant, if one is unlucky enough to be targeted, it is bound to be a troublesome affair.\n\nZhou Ze refused Fatty, who left rather dejectedly. As he stood at the doorway, Fatty lit a cigarette, touched his faux-gold chain that was flaking gold powder,\n\nand cursed:\n\n\"Idiot.\"\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, continued to sit behind the counter, reading. Fatty's visit was merely a small interlude in his life recently.\n\nThe Female Corpse, as usual, sat on a chair with her eyes closed after cleaning the bookstore, leaning against the wall, as if spacing out or feigning sleep.\n\nThe two of them lived a life that took on the flavor of an old woman's foot-binding cloth.<sup>2</sup>\n\nZhou Ze was content, recalling that what he had most looked forward to in his previous life was to live exactly as he was now: idling away the hours, wasting time, reading, and spacing out.\n\nNo need to be constantly ready for emergency patients, nor to constantly push himself to climb up bit by bit.\n\nFor the Female Corpse, she had been lying in a coffin for two hundred years and had long grown accustomed to boredom and silence. Now, it was just a drop in the bucket.\n\nCompared to the bookstore's \"calm as water,\" Xu Qinglang was much more spirited and ambitious. He was wealthy, and actually had no great pursuit in metaphysics; instead, he thought about how to make money and develop through his own abilities.\n\nTherefore, Xu Qinglang was very displeased with the decadent style of the master and servant next door!\n\n\"Look at you, lazy as a corpse every day.\" Xu Qinglang, as usual, came over for a cigarette after a busy day, showering Zhou Ze with some sarcasm.\n\n\"I am a dead person to begin with.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\n\"Look at you, a man who has lived two lives, yet you barely have any money now. I, on the other hand, am a man with over twenty properties, and I'm still working hard.\"\n\nAs per custom, after belittling Zhou Ze, he had to praise himself.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang and chuckled, \"Are you preparing a dowry for yourself?\"\n\n\"You can't expect ivory from a dog's mouth.\" Xu Qinglang raised his head, looking at the night sky (the ceiling). \"I just want to live more comfortably when I retire later.\"\n\n\"Over twenty properties for the living are enough to attract a Ghost Madame to carry you back in an eight-bearer sedan chair for marriage. If you work harder, earn more money, buy more properties, maybe next time some Ghost Queen will feel you're socially well-matched, and I, as a ghost messenger, can also benefit from your glory.\n\nDon't forget me when you get rich.<sup>3</sup>\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The Female Corpse, feigning sleep nearby, was very cooperative with her boss.\n\n\"It's almost eight, I need to get ready.\" Xu Qinglang said, checking the time.\n\n\"For what?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nNormally, Xu Qinglang rested quite early in the evening.\n\n\"Today is the day the Confucian Temple opens its doors. Isn't the college entrance exam in just a few months? I have a relative's child back home taking the exam this year, and they asked me to go to the Confucian Temple to burn incense for them.\"\n\n\"You're willing to go for this?\" Zhou Ze knew Xu Qinglang's character. To say he was indifferent and selfish would be an overstatement, but he was generally too lazy to bother with anything other than making money.\n\n\"I ate at their house when I was little, and received their help. Otherwise, I don't know if I would have survived until the demolition, so this favor must be repaid.\" Xu Qinglang said, looking serious.\n\n\"Hmm.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"How about we go together?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly invited. \"Help me grab the first incense stick?\"\n\n\"The Confucian Temple also values the first incense stick?\"\n\n\"Hey, it's a good omen, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm not very strong.\" Zhou Ze had seen how frantic people were when grabbing the first incense stick. His body really couldn't handle it, unless he used his fingernails to clear a path, but he couldn't just knock everyone around him down, could he?\n\n\"Ask her then.\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the Female Corpse. \"She's strong as an ox, she can clear a path for me.\"\n\nThe Female Corpse frowned, preparing to retort with sarcasm.\n\n\"Do you want to go out for a walk?\" Xu Qinglang raised an eyebrow.\n\nThe words on the Female Corpse's lips were immediately swallowed, and a radiant smile blossomed on her face.\n\nShe hadn't stepped foot out of the bookstore these past few days.\n\nHaving no choice, Zhou Ze could only nod in agreement. He wasn't at ease with the Female Corpse going out alone. Even though she was as considerate and obedient as a maidservant now, people's hearts are hidden, let alone a zombie without a \"heart\"?\n\nZhou Ze even believed that if his abilities ever disappeared, the first to devour his flesh and blood would likely be this very Female Corpse, who was currently so servile.\n\nThe three of them took a taxi to the Confucian Temple. While calling the crowd outside the temple \"a mountain of people and a sea of heads\" might be an exaggeration, it was certainly packed three layers deep inside and out.\n\nOh, the pitiable hearts of parents everywhere.\n\nXu Qinglang met up with the relative and his wife he had mentioned outside the Confucian Temple—two middle-aged people who looked very honest and reliable.\n\nTheir son, of course, hadn't come. Everyone was there for a good omen; no one was truly so foolish as to believe it could actually guarantee a high score in the college entrance exam. There were almost no students of school age present; they were likely at home studying or similar.\n\nTongcheng's Confucian Temple \"opened its doors\" after the New Year. As for why it wasn't before the New Year, perhaps the scholars and masters in the temple felt it would be somewhat beneath their dignity to compete for offerings with those demons and monsters during the festive season.\n\nIt was better to do it after the New Year,\n\nto see their gates deserted with few carriages and horses, while their own place was filled with believers like clouds, thus demonstrating their prestige.\n\nAs for the specific reasons and how it was done in other parts of the country, Zhou Ze wasn't clear. Customs meant inexplicable rules; who could explain them?\n\nJust like the recent online sensation about a father-in-law kissing his daughter-in-law at a wedding in a city neighboring Tongcheng, which could even be attributed to \"customs.\" That made even less sense.\n\nWith a \"creak,\"\n\nthe vermilion wooden doors opened.\n\nInstantly, the waiting parents outside transformed into \"ferocious beasts\" and surged into the Confucian Temple.\n\nThe Female Corpse led the charge, with Xu Qinglang and his relatives following closely behind, like Zhao Zilong at Changbanpo.<sup>4</sup>\n\nZhou Ze didn't join the commotion. He squatted on the curb outside the gates, smoking.\n\nAs he smoked, Zhou Ze was surprised to find the cigarette in his hand suddenly extinguished.\n\nZhou Ze relit it, but the subsequent puffs suddenly became bland and tasteless.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze dropped the cigarette butt and looked around. He knew that his cigarette had been taken as an offering.\n\nDoesn't consume offerings, nor acknowledge tributes,\n\njust to have a puff of a mortal's cigarette,\n\none could only wonder what kind of demon or monster this was.\n\nZhou Ze naturally felt no indignation like, \"Damn it, how dare you steal my cigarette!\" A month ago, he was still an undocumented spirit, only getting promoted to a temporary worker half a month later.\n\nHe had no sense of \"chickens and dogs ascending to heaven\"<sup>5</sup> or the \"This road is mine to command\"<sup>6</sup> kind of overbearing aura.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nA gong sounded,\n\nstrikingly abrupt and jarring in the night.\n\nZhou Ze looked in the direction of the sound.\n\nFrom the flower garden behind the Confucian Temple emerged a short, dwarfish old man. The old man held a brass gong, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, and was hopping out.\n\nThe old man even deliberately glanced at Zhou Ze, opened his mouth, and exhaled a smoke ring, seemingly indicating thanks for Zhou Ze's cigarette.\n\nZhou Ze also smiled,\n\nlighting all the remaining cigarettes in his hand with a lighter and placing them one by one on the ground, leaving only one for himself to smoke.\n\nSoon, all the cigarettes on the ground extinguished, and the dwarfish old man hopped even more joyfully. He seemed to find this proactive junior increasingly pleasing, and his small pockets were bulging, likely filled with cigarettes.\n\nThe dwarfish old man led the way with his gong,\n\nand behind him, a group of people slowly followed.\n\nThese were not the parents who had just surged into the Confucian Temple,\n\nbut a group of strangely dressed individuals.\n\nThe first few, wearing feather fans and silk turbans, walked with a stumbling gait and ashen faces, slowly following the old man's steps.\n\nAfter them were two more with greasy long queues and vacant gazes, also still following the old man forward.\n\nSome of the later individuals wore increasingly modern attire; the last few were even dressed in contemporary clothes, indistinguishable from ordinary high school students.\n\nHowever, some had ghastly green faces, while others had shattered skulls.\n\nOut of occupational habit, Zhou Ze quickly deduced that the latter few students had either died from poisoning or had jumped from a building.\n\nOne of them looked somewhat familiar to Zhou Ze; he seemed to have seen his photo while browsing news a few years ago. Under pressure from a poor performance in a mock exam, he had committed suicide by jumping from a building.\n\nThe dwarfish old man walked forward, beating his brass gong, while the group of \"scholarly students\" behind him followed like marionettes,\n\nThey were like a parade,\n\ncircling the Confucian Temple.\n\nAs for the nearby pedestrians,\n\nno one could see them except Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nA gong sounded,\n\n\"No need to build a tall house to live in peace, for within books lies a golden house!\" the dwarfish old man loudly rasped.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nAnother gong sounded,\n\n\"Do not lament the lack of a good matchmaker when seeking a wife, for within books lies beauty like jade!\"<sup>7</sup>\n\nThe dwarfish old man continued to shout.\n\nAfter walking around the Confucian Temple three times,\n\nthis bizarre procession slowly vanished.\n\nA moment later,\n\nthe parents who had finished burning incense began to emerge from the Confucian Temple.\n\nTheir faces held satisfaction,\n\nhope,\n\nand the fervent wish for their sons to become dragons.\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> \"Shanzhai culture\" refers to the phenomenon of imitation, counterfeiting, or parody, often with a playful or rebellious spirit, common in Chinese popular culture.\n<sup>2</sup> Lit. \"like an old woman's foot-binding cloth,\" an idiom implying something is long, tedious, and boring.\n<sup>3</sup> Lit. \"If you become wealthy, don't forget your old friends.\" A classical Chinese saying.\n<sup>4</sup> Zhao Zilong was a famous general from the Three Kingdoms period, known for his bravery and skill in battle, especially at the Battle of Changbanpo where he single-handedly fought through enemy lines to rescue his lord's infant son.\n<sup>5</sup> Lit. \"chickens and dogs ascend to heaven,\" an idiom referring to minor associates or even pets of a successful person benefiting from their rise.\n<sup>6</sup> Lit. \"This road is mine,\" a phrase famously used by bandits to assert their control over a territory and demand tolls.\n<sup>7</sup> These are lines from a famous classical Chinese couplet: \"In books, one finds golden houses (wealth/prosperity); in books, one finds beauty like jade (beautiful women).\" It promotes the idea that studying leads to a prosperous and fulfilling life.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang and the female corpse, including the middle-aged couple, all came out. The middle-aged couple's faces were beaming with joy. Evidently, with the female corpse's help, they had snatched the first incense stick.\n*\n\nWhether useful or not, it was a good omen after all.\n\nEven non-superstitious parents, before their child's major exam, would give them a *zongzi* and a *nian gao*, symbolizing \"gao-zong.\"\n**\n\nThe female corpse's expression was not very good. When everyone walked back together, she lagged behind by herself.\n\n\"Let's go for a late-night snack, how about barbecue?\" Xu Qinglang suggested.\n\nHe owned a restaurant himself, but he wouldn't let himself prepare barbecue late at night;\n\nMadam Xu's\n***\nskin was precious; how could it endure such smoke and fire?\n\nHowever, Xu Qinglang regretted this suggestion as soon as he made it.\n\nIn this group,\n\nThere was a zombie, and also a living dead person unconcerned with earthly food,\n****\n\nJust imagining the scene at dinner, these two would sit there motionless, like clay statues in a temple enjoying incense offerings.\n\nThis scene, just thinking about it, ruined one's appetite.\n\n\"You go ahead, we'll head back first,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"How could we impose?\" the middle-aged man said.\n\n\"It's alright, uncle, we'll go eat. Let the young couple take a stroll by themselves.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled the middle-aged couple away.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to hail a taxi, and walked along the sparsely populated small road with the female corpse.\n\nThe weather was starting to get warmer, and it wasn't as cool at night as before.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked the female corpse.\n\nThe female corpse had been sulking ever since she came out of the Confucian Temple.\n*****\n\n\"Uncomfortable,\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"Still haven't stopped menstruating?\"\n\nIt's been two hundred years.\n\n\"............\" The female corpse.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, the female corpse finally spoke, \"A few statues in the Confucian Temple were staring at me; it felt strange.\"\n\n\"You think they were looking at you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Mm.\" The female corpse nodded.\n\n\"You think they disliked you?\"\n\n\"Mm.\" The female corpse continued to nod.\n\n\"You think because you're a zombie, you originally shouldn't have gone to that place?\"\n\n\"Mm.\" The female corpse still nodded.\n\n\"Sages advocate for education without discrimination.\" Zhou Ze smiled, reached out and patted the female corpse's head, saying, \"You are a zombie, a type of existence detested by both humans and ghosts, but you went to the Confucian Temple to help someone offer incense, and you also contributed incense offerings and popularity to them.\n\nYou feel they were looking at you,\n\nIt might be because of your uniqueness, so they were paying attention to you.\n\nIt's like a husky suddenly mixed into a pack of prairie wolves; anyone would take a second look, right?\n\nOf course, it's also possible they are just a pile of clay figures, and their eyes are said to be made from donkey dung balls, because that makes them appear more spirited and lustrous.\n\nAll of it is just you putting psychological pressure on yourself.\"\n\n\"But what if they really were looking at me? What if they really had an opinion about me...\" The female corpse was still somewhat hesitant.\n\n\"Then they don't deserve to be enshrined in a temple as those damned sages!\"\n\nZhou Ze spoke forcefully,\n\n\"Sages enjoy incense offerings for thousands of generations; if they don't even have this much tolerance, then what face do they have to shamelessly sit on the temple's offering table?\n\nWhat's there to be afraid of, a fake sage?\"\n\nThe female corpse looked at Zhou Ze, a smile playing on her lips, and said, \"Boss, what you just said was really domineering.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Zhou Ze enjoyed his maid's flattery.\n\n\"But Boss, you are a ghost messenger; there is a certain destiny in the unseen world. For ordinary people, the repercussions might not be significant, but for you, it's different.\n\nFurthermore, you run a bookstore, which is an industry blessed by the good fortune of sages. Your slandering sages like this is really not good for you.\"\n\nIt was rare for the female corpse to speak so frankly to Zhou Ze; in the past, she would have wished for Zhou Ze to court death;\n\nJump, jump, if you jump yourself to death, I can just collect your corpse, then remove your fingernails, grind them into powder, and use them as pearl powder to brew tea and drink,\n\nOh no, feed them to pigs!\n\n\"It's still that saying: 'If you do nothing wrong, you fear no ghost... or sage knocking on your door.'\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the streetlights and continued:\n\n\"In my previous life, I cured illnesses and saved people, didn't accept red envelopes, didn't cross ethical lines, and always adhered to medical ethics.\n\nEven in this life, after becoming a ghost and borrowing a corpse to return to the living, I haven't done anything that would weigh on my conscience.\n\nWhat is there to be afraid of?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and repeated, \"There's nothing to be afraid of.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the female corpse's eyes showed contemplation.\n\nZhou Ze's words were not a declaration of adolescent bravado,\n******\nbut rather a warning to himself.\n\nThe two continued walking aimlessly forward; the evening breeze was slightly cool, but very pleasant.\n\nFinally, the female corpse stopped and asked, \"Boss, where are you going?\"\n\nZhou Ze stopped, subconsciously looked around, and was astonished to find that he had walked into the entrance of a residential complex.\n\nFamiliar surroundings,\n\nA familiar guardhouse,\n\nA familiar security guard sleeping on the job in the guardhouse at night,\n\nA familiar parcel locker.\n\nHe had actually just strolled,\n\nAnd naturally walked back to the residential complex where he used to live.\n\nAlthough it had been a month at the bookstore, subconsciously, this was his home.\n\nHaving grown up in an orphanage, he understood the meaning of home more deeply, and at the same time, he was more attached to houses.\n\nFortunately, when he bought his house, Tongcheng's housing prices hadn't risen to such an absurd level later on. It was also because he couldn't wait to become a \"mortgage slave\" as soon as he started working, which ironically meant he \"picked up a watermelon,\" making his colleagues who bought houses later quite envious.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze couldn't even retrieve his old WeChat and QQ accounts now; phone verification was impossible, and asking friends in his contact list to help verify would either make people think he was crazy or scare them to death.\n\nEven his own house was sold by the hospital after his death, and the money was donated to the orphanage in his name.\n\nZhou Ze didn't object to this action, as he had no other relatives in life.\n\n\"This was my former home,\" Zhou Ze said to the female corpse.\n\n\"Then, shall we go up and take a look?\" the female corpse suggested.\n\n\"It's already been sold,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\"Consider it a visit to an old haunt.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked over.\n\nHe entered Building 8, Unit 2, took the elevator, and arrived at the fifth floor.\n\nZhou Ze walked to a front door; the door was still the same door. The buyer probably hadn't had time to redecorate, right?\n\nEven the doormat hadn't changed.\n\nAnd the cactus placed at the entrance was also there.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, felt under the pot, and pulled out a key.\n\nBack then, he was often called to the hospital for emergency duty at night, and many times he would forget his phone or keys. So, his spare key was kept there, to prevent himself from being locked out of his home.\n\nWith a 'let's just try' mindset, he inserted the key and turned it.\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nThe lock opened.\n\nThe door hadn't been changed,\n\nAnd the lock hadn't been changed either?\n\nZhou Ze was somewhat surprised; he pushed open the door and casually turned on the light.\n\nThe furnishings in the living room were all as before.\n\nZhou Ze even saw his own slippers, changed into them and walked in, and the female corpse followed him in.\n\n\"Boss, is it still the same as before?\" the female corpse asked.\n\n\"Mm, that's also what I find most peculiar.\"\n\nIt was indeed still the same as before,\n\nBut this didn't make sense.\n\nShouldn't ordinary people throw away everything used by a dead person after buying a house?\n\nHow could everything still be kept, and perfectly preserved, without considering it unlucky?\n\nPerhaps, the person who took over his house just bought it for investment? Not actually living in it themselves?\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the sofa; it was as if, at this moment, he had become himself again.\n\nEvery time he returned home tired, he would watch TV, cook a little late-night snack; his days were packed, yet fulfilling.\n\nThe female corpse went and boiled water for tea, poured a cup for Zhou Ze, and then said:\n\n\"Boss, you've been dead for more than half a year, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Seven months,\"\n\nZhou Ze replied, but why did the conversation feel a bit strange?\n\n\"But it's so clean here; it doesn't look like no one has lived in it for seven months,\" the female corpse reminded him.\n\nZhou Ze nodded; it was true. The place was very clean; someone must be cleaning it regularly.\n\nBut Zhou Ze found it hard to imagine that the person who bought his house would be so lazy as to throw nothing away, change nothing, and even keep the door lock.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door and found that even his own bedding and sheets were the ones he used before.\n\n\"Boss, I'm going to take a shower. Just now, being stared at by those old things in the Confucian Temple for so long gave me goosebumps all over.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, turn on the water heater first,\" Zhou Ze reminded her. \"The bath towel is in the cabinet by the bathroom door.\"\n\nIf,\n\nAll the furnishings were truly as before.\n\nThe female corpse went to shower. She was very clean; women naturally love cleanliness. In her previous life, she was a cultured lady; lying in a coffin for two hundred years without being able to bathe, how uncomfortable that must have been.\n\nSo she basically showered once in the morning and once at night, wasting a lot of Zhou Ze's water bill.\n\nBut thinking that she worked as a server in his shop without asking for wages, Zhou Ze tolerated it.\n\nPulling open the curtains, Zhou Ze stood on the balcony, looking at the shimmering night lights in front.\n\nHere,\n\nWas his home.\n\nIt hadn't changed,\n\nBut it no longer belonged to him.\n\nThings are the same, but people have changed,\n*******\n\nA true sense of \"things are the same, but people have changed.\"\n\nTaking out a cigarette, he lit it, and Zhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring.\n\nIn his heart, there was some disappointment. He thought he should be able to let go, but in reality, he couldn't.\n\nJust as he had personally thrown that infant into hell to await reincarnation,\n\nHe now deeply realized,\n\nAs a living person, his attachment to the living world was truly hard to describe in words.\n\nEven he, at this moment, had an impulse to buy his house back.\n\nAs for money,\n\nWith his abilities, if he really wanted to illegally get some money,\n\nWould it be difficult?\n\nThis impulse was suppressed with great difficulty. Zhou Ze knew that this was a path of no return, a Pandora's Box; once opened, he would certainly be unable to stop.\n\nZhou Ze thought he was a disciplined person, but no matter when, if it could be avoided, one should not test one's \"human integrity.\"\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nVery unexpectedly,\n\nThe sound of a key entering the lock came from the door.\n\nHad the owner returned?\n\nZhou Ze turned around, walked back to the living room from the balcony. He was thinking about how to explain to the owner why he was currently in the house, but he wasn't overly nervous.\n\nAfter all was said and done, he was still a ghost messenger. If he really ended up being arrested at the police station for trespassing,\n\nWouldn't that be too unfair to himself?\n\nDiscipline was discipline, but there was no need for self-abuse.\n\nThis was, after all, his former home.\n\nHowever, when the door was pushed open,\n\nThe one who walked in,\n\nWas surprisingly a familiar figure.\n\nDoctor Lin stood at the doorway, looking at Zhou Ze standing in the living room, her face showing shock and panic, and said:\n\n\"You... why are you here?\"\n\nZhou Ze was also speechless for a moment,\n\nThe one who bought his house,\n\nWas surprisingly Doctor Lin?\n\n\"Listen to me explain.\" Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"Listen to me explain.\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two spoke this sentence at the same time,\n\nFor Lin Wanqiu, she was very flustered, because she felt that Zhou Ze had discovered evidence of her \"emotional infidelity,\"\n\nHad found this place. She was his wife, yet she bought a house left by another man, and had been cleaning and tidying it, and because of that man, refused to have conjugal relations with him.\n\nDoctor Lin felt very much in the wrong.\n\nFortunately, this awkward atmosphere didn't last long,\n\nBecause something even more awkward appeared,\n\n\"Boss, I accidentally got my clothes wet.\"\n\nThe female corpse said this while walking out wrapped in just a bath towel,\n\nWalking to,\n\nThe living room,\n\nStanding between Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu,\n\nIn the middle.\n***\nTranslator's Notes:\n*   **头香 (tóu xiāng)**: Literally \"first incense,\" refers to being the first to offer incense at a temple, especially on an auspicious occasion (like New Year's or before exams), believed to bring the most blessings or good luck.\n**  **糕粽 (gāozòng)**: A pun. \"糕粽\" (sticky rice cake and rice dumpling) sounds like \"高中\" (gāozhōng), which means \"senior high school\" or \"successfully entering senior high school.\" It's a common good luck charm given before exams.\n***\n**许娘娘 (Xǔ Niángniang)**: \"Madam Xu\" or \"Empress Xu.\" This is a playful nickname for Xu Qinglang, likely highlighting his meticulousness or refined, perhaps effeminate, demeanor.\n****\n**不食人间烟火 (bù shí rén jiān yān huǒ)**: Literally \"does not eat human world's smoke and fire.\" This idiom describes someone who is aloof, otherworldly, or not concerned with mundane human affairs and sustenance. Here, it literally refers to the characters not needing to eat physical food.\n*****\n**文庙 (Wénmiào)**: Confucian Temple, a temple dedicated to Confucius and other prominent Confucian figures.\n******\n**中二 (zhōng èr)**: Short for \"中二病\" (zhōng èr bìng), a Japanese loanword (chuunibyou) meaning \"middle schooler syndrome.\" It describes a phase where adolescents develop grandiose delusions, believing they possess special powers or a unique destiny. Here, it refers to an \"adolescent grandiose declaration\" or \"chuunibyo declaration.\"\n*******\n**物是人非 (wù shì rén fēi)**: An idiom meaning \"things are the same, but people have changed.\" It conveys a sense of melancholy or nostalgia when one revisits a place to find the surroundings unchanged, but the people or circumstances associated with it are gone or altered.",

    "content": "The air suddenly fell silent, a most dreaded quiet…\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Doctor Lin lowered her head, also feeling a sense of relief.\n\nOne, emotionally unfaithful,\n\nThe other, \"physically unfaithful,\"\n\nOne person making a mistake is guilt,\n\nTwo people making a mistake together is gender equality.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze laughed, a rather unrestrained laugh.\n\nThat's right,\n\nAfter he died, the one who bought his house turned out to be his current \"wife.\"\n\nIndeed, Doctor Lin was wealthy; buying a second-hand house in Tongcheng whose previous owner had died was easy for her. Moreover, it seemed only she would clean it, while keeping its layout unchanged.\n\nMoved?\n\nOf course, moved.\n\nZhou Ze was Zhou Ze; even though he was now in Xu Le's body, he still identified with his own perspective as Zhou Ze.\n\nXu Le was a thing of the past; regardless of whether that child's emotional life was rough or lacked dignity, Zhou Ze wouldn't pay too much attention to it.\n\nIt's like during the Lunar New Year, when everyone is having New Year's Eve dinner together, a goofball at the table suddenly takes out their phone and says to everyone, \"Look, refugees in some parts of Africa are starving, skinny as skeletons, can you still eat your food?\"\n\nTo have such a woman, as if possessed, always remembering him, missing him,\n\nAs a man,\n\nhow could he not be proud, not be moved?\n\n\"Find my clothes and change into them,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing at Bai Yingying.\n\nThe female corpse nodded, letting out an \"oh.\" This time was unlike last time; she didn't dare to indulge her temper, thinking it was fun and deliberately adding fuel to the fire. She obediently went to Zhou Ze's bedroom, found Zhou Ze's clean clothes, changed, and came out.\n\nDoctor Lin was still standing in place, saying nothing.\n\nShe seemed to feel a sense of liberation, and also a sense of peace. However, Zhou Ze didn't let her continue with this emotion. Instead, he walked forward, reached out and gripped Doctor Lin's hand, and said very seriously:\n\n\"There's something I need to tell you. Come with me.\"\n\nHolding Doctor Lin's hand, Zhou Ze, with a bit of assertiveness, went out the door with her and entered the elevator. Bai Yingying followed behind, not saying a word, knowing that the more she spoke now, the more mistakes she'd make.\n\nAfter going downstairs, Zhou Ze walked to Doctor Lin's Cayenne and reached out, gesturing for Doctor Lin to give him the car keys.\n\nZhou Ze decided he would tell her his identity, regardless of whether she could accept it, regardless of whether she was similar to \"Lord Ye's love for dragons\" in ancient stories.*\n\nIn short, Zhou Ze wanted to tell her the truth. He didn't want to be hesitant anymore, nor did he want to hide things. After all, times had changed; back then he was an unregistered entity, but now he had been legitimized.\n\nThere was no reason to make himself suffer.\n\n\"You don't have a driver's license,\" Doctor Lin reminded him.\n\n\"Give me the keys,\" Zhou Ze said very firmly, with an air of unquestionability.\n\nHe wanted to take her to the hospital, to that familiar operating room, and use concrete actions to tell her his true identity;\n\notherwise, he worried that if he merely described it in words, she might think he was having an episode of \"sympathetic husband's delusions.\"\n\nDoctor Lin gave the car keys to Zhou Ze, and then all three got into the car.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the driver's seat, Doctor Lin sat in the front passenger seat, and Bai Yingying obediently sat in the back.\n\nThe car started and backed out.\n\nZhou Ze looked skilled and at ease.\n\nThat goofball Xu Le didn't even have a driver's license.\n\nHe, however, was an experienced driver.\n\nThen,\n\nonly to hear an ear-piercing \"screech screech screech...\" grinding sound, and the car body also shook.\n\nZhou Ze fell silent,\n\nthe other two women in the car also fell silent.\n\nThe Cayenne's car body hit a utility pole, grinding hard against it.\n\nIn the pitch-black night, it was as if another very diligent crow,\n\nvery coincidentally, flew across the sky again,\n\nperiodically made \"caw... caw... caw\" sounds.\n\nThe air again fell into an extremely awkward silence.\n\nZhou Ze unbuckled his seatbelt and said, \"You drive.\"\n\n\"To People's Hospital?\"\n\nDoctor Lin asked after changing seats.\n\n\"Yes, People's Hospital.\" Zhou Ze, sitting in the front passenger seat, reached out and covered his forehead, then gently tapped the car window.\n\nToo long not driving, plus changing bodies, his driving skills had become too rusty.\n\nBut no matter how many reasons there were,\n\nthat was really embarrassing just now.\n\nThe car got on the road and quickly got onto the East Express elevated road.\n\nIt was very quiet inside the car. Doctor Lin didn't speak; even though she didn't know why Zhou Ze wanted to go to the hospital, she didn't ask.\n\nThe couple's relationship,\n\nwas truly riddled with holes.\n\nBai Yingying sat in the back seat, looking at the scenery outside the window. She hadn't been able to come out for a long time; although Madam Bai used to chat and talk with her almost every day, she really rarely had the chance to personally come out and see this outside world.\n\nIn addition, she knew she wasn't suitable for speaking right now.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly sat up straight and said, \"That car, is it going the wrong way?\"\n\nOn the other side of the low concrete wall was the other opposite lane of the elevated road. There was a white sedan there, but its front was facing the same direction as Zhou Ze's car.\n\nThis meant the other party was going the wrong way.\n\nAnd at this moment,\n\na large bus drove past in the adjacent lane, its high beams very dazzling.\n\nImmediately after, came the ear-piercing screech of emergency brakes.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously closed his eyes and simultaneously covered his head with both hands. That bus was in the adjacent lane; it was impossible for it to hit him, but this scene was almost the most terrifying image in his memory.\n\nHis former self had been hit like this by a large truck on the way home from work,\n\nand everything at this moment triggered the most terrifying and most unwilling-to-recall scene in his heart.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA muffled impact sound came, and Doctor Lin immediately stopped the car.\n\nIn the adjacent lane, that large bus and that white sedan going the wrong way collided. The sedan was pushed out, then heavily rammed into the concrete barrier by the front of the bus. The car body was completely deformed.\n\nTurning on the hazard lights, Doctor Lin quickly got out of the car. Looking at her husband, who was cowering and trembling in the front passenger seat, a hint of disappointment appeared in her eyes. But she still immediately opened the trunk, took out the warning triangle and placed it behind the car. Afterwards, she immediately climbed over the barrier to the other side.\n\nShe was a doctor; she needed to fulfill her responsibility. When an accident occurs, if there are professional rescue forces nearby, the victims' lives have a high probability of being saved.\n\n\"Boss?\" Bai Yingying, sitting in the back, called out.\n\nZhou Ze released his hands and looked around somewhat blankly. He saw the accident scene in the adjacent lane; Doctor Lin had already rushed over.\n\n\"Come down with me and save people.\"\n\nZhou Ze got out of the car, his legs feeling a bit weak.\n\nThis was a kind of self-preservation instinct in humans; when psychological trauma is triggered, it often leads to the body producing a weak defensive reaction.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze didn't hesitate at all and also climbed over the barrier to that side, ready to save people.\n\nBai Yingying followed along.\n\nThe bus driver also had blood on his face; probably his head hit the steering wheel or somewhere else during the crash. Three other people got off the bus; they were probably passengers or something. In short, this bus was very empty.\n\n\"This son of a bitch must be crazy, driving against traffic on an elevated road! If you want to die, don't harm others!\" the bus driver said, cursing, while one hand covered the wound on his forehead.\n\nAnyone who encountered such bad luck would be very angry.\n\n\"Stop yelling! Save people!\" Doctor Lin snapped at the bus driver.\n\nAccident responsibility can be discussed later; for now, let's get the people in the sedan out first.\n\n\"Hey, are you still conscious? Can you answer me?\" Doctor Lin shouted at the person inside the deformed sedan.\n\nBut there was no response.\n\nThe bus driver grumbled but still participated in the rescue. This road was already somewhat remote, a section of the elevated road where few cars traveled. Occasionally a car would pass by, but they didn't stop to curiously watch and drove straight past.\n\n\"Pry open the car door!\" Zhou Ze suggested.\n\n\"No equipment, how can we pry it?\" Doctor Lin was a bit agitated, especially when her husband, who didn't understand, still gave blind instructions. She became even more annoyed and irritable.\n\nThere were two people in the car, a woman and a child. Their situation was very bad now; both of them were covered in blood, and there was no response at all to the shouting.\n\nThe car door was dented inwards and was almost stuck there. This required the fire department to come with specialized equipment to cut it open.\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward, reached out and grabbed the car door. Bai Yingying also came over at this moment; she was a zombie, her strength was naturally great, and she exerted force together with Zhou Ze.\n\nOnly a \"crunch\" was heard,\n\nthe car door was directly detached, and Bai Yingying also pressed down the car seat's backrest in the process.\n\nDoctor Lin was stunned,\n\nThe bus owner and the few passengers on the bus were also stunned.\n\n\"This must be good luck, it must have been lightly stuck.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down, one hand protecting the woman's neck, the other holding her legs, and carefully dragged her out first. Afterwards, he then went to drag the boy's body out.\n\nDoctor Lin first examined the woman's body, her expression grim. When the boy was pulled out, she then examined the boy's body, her expression immediately turning somber.\n\nDead,\n\nBoth dead.\n\n\"Dead?\" the bus owner asked with some disbelief, his face very pale at the same time. \"I've truly had terrible luck! These bastards, coming out at night to harm people, they've really messed me up!\"\n\n\"Call the police and call 120,\" Doctor Lin shouted to the bus owner, her phone still in the car.\n\nAlthough the bus owner was very angry, he still took out his phone and started calling.\n\nZhou Ze, however, turned over both the woman's and the boy's bodies. Doctor Lin saw Zhou Ze's action and was somewhat puzzled.\n\n\"When I just pulled them out, I incidentally checked them. They had many external injuries, all caused by the car accident.\n\nBut they had one thing in common: at the back of their heads, both had depressed skull fractures. Most likely, these should be fatal injuries.\n\nI think they might have been caused by someone hitting them with a hammer wrapped in cotton cloth.\"\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Doctor Lin immediately followed up by examining the wounds in that area and immediately understood, saying, \"They were already dead before the car accident!\"\n\nYes, otherwise it would be hard to explain why two people suffered the same fatal injury in the same spot. This was too coincidental, so coincidental that it was almost impossible.\n\n\"Dead people were placed in the car and then drove against traffic,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Doctor Lin with a smile. \"Then disguised as a car accident. A pretty good accidental event.\"\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze turned his face and looked at the bus owner behind him who was calling the police. The few passengers who were originally standing around the bus also slowly started to surround them.\n\nThe bus owner also looked at Zhou Ze, a meaningful smile also appearing on his face, and he said to the other end of the phone:\n\n\"Boss, things are a bit unlucky. We ran into a few meddlesome unlucky devils.\"\n___\n*Lit. \"Lord Ye loves dragons.\" An idiom from a Chinese fable, meaning professing to like something while in reality fearing it, or claiming to love something that one only appreciates superficially.",

    "content": "As a surgeon, Zhou Ze could easily examine and discover the abnormality of the corpse's death. Then, those forensic doctors whose specialty matched could obviously also discover it.\n\nBecause of this, in Zhou Ze's view, the staging of this car accident was actually very unsuccessful; it was merely \"superficial\" and could not withstand scrutiny at all.\n\nHe also didn't know if this group of people had other backup plans or methods to perfectly complete this case into an accidental event, or perhaps, they really were just \"rookies\"?\n\nOf course, now was not the time to think about this question, because this group of people seemed not to intend to continue to dither.\n\n\"Grab them, then drive their car away.\"\n\nThe bus driver looked at the time; time was very precious now.\n\nSeveral subordinates directly pounced. For them, a thin man plus two young women could not make any waves at all.\n\nBai Yingying tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze. She was waiting for Zhou Ze's order.\n\nDoctor Lin stood in place; it was clear that she was very nervous, but she neither screamed nor yelled. To be able to do this much was already very difficult.\n\nMost people facing this situation, even those who usually boasted their guts were bigger than the sky, would probably be quite normal to be scared to kneel and beg for mercy, shouting, \"I didn't see anything.\"\n\n\"No killing,\" Zhou Ze reminded.\n\n\"Haha.\" The bus owner laughed upon hearing this.\n\nIt's just a pity that Zhou Ze's words were not directed at him.\n\nBai Yingying replied with a \"Got it!\" and then directly rushed over.\n\nZhou Ze took a step back, grabbed Doctor Lin's hand, and said, \"It's okay, I'm here.\"\n\nBai Yingying, who was rushing ahead, nearly stumbled.\n\nThis old lady is charging and fighting in front,\nand you actually still have the time and inclination to go back and be lovey-dovey?\nMistress,\nOh no, a maid also has dignity, okay?!\n\nDoctor Lin pursed her lips. She blamed herself and said, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nIt was she who stopped the car to save someone, which caused everyone to encounter this crisis, so she apologized.\n\n\"It's to be expected, professional idiocy,\" Zhou Ze said with a bitter smile. Last time in the cinema, he also rushed in like this. He could only say that some professional habits really couldn't be changed.\n\nThe female corpse had just been force-fed a handful of \"dog food\",¹ so her actions subconsciously became a bit heavier.\n\n\"Little wench, come, brother will dote on you.\"\n\nA man opened his arms, preparing to hug this high school girl.\n\nThe boss didn't let them kill here; instead, he was preparing to take them away. After all, things here couldn't be dragged on for too long.\n\nHowever, his arms embraced emptiness.\n\nImmediately after, his left arm was grabbed by the female corpse.\n\n\"Crack…\"\n\"Crack…\"\n\"Crack…\"\n\nDoctor Lin's body trembled upon hearing it; Zhou Ze also found it a bit grating, he even thought that if \"Bugles\"² GG³ were to be used for the sound here, the effect would definitely be better than the current GG,\n\ncrispy and crunchy.\n\nThe man opened his mouth wide; he couldn't even cry out in pain. The female corpse stepped forward again and kicked the man's calf.\n\n\"Crunch… Crunch… Crunch…\"\n\nAnother three crisp sounds.\n\nLay's Chips⁴ could also be used for the sound and let out as GG, Zhou Ze thought.\n\n\"I… f**k…\"\n\nThe man was curled up on the ground; one arm was completely crippled, and the other leg was also completely broken. His whole person was like a toad lying on the ground, only able to wail and squirm.\n\nZhou Ze had not the slightest bit of compassion. He didn't allow the female corpse to kill because affairs of the living world could only be handed over to the police to handle. He believed that the judicial organs of this country would allow all evil to have nowhere to hide.\n\nBut these people in front of him were, after all, cold-blooded murderers, and were also preparing to attack him. Zhou Ze also wasn't so overflowing with a \"Holy Mother\" complex⁵ that he would feel treating them like this was pitiful.\n\nHeaven knows how they had just planned to deal with the three of them?\n\nIf he were still that doctor from his previous life, and the female corpse was just a high school girl, then who would pity them?\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\"Clang!\"\n\"Snap!\"\n\nThe other two men were directly knocked down; it was the same: bones fractured, though not fatal, but they were already crippled.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's professional perspective, these three people lying on the ground, even after receiving medical treatment at the hospital, would likely be unable to live independently for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe bus owner's phone fell and smashed onto the ground.\n\nHe subconsciously swallowed a mouthful of saliva,\nonly felt that everything before his eyes was so unreal.\n\nHe didn't bring a shotgun, because he had previously planned to face interrogation and investigation from traffic police and regular police, so it was naturally impossible to bring any contraband.\n\nHe had originally thought that even if Zhou Ze and these few \"warm-hearted\" people appeared, this matter would not undergo too great a change.\n\nEven if a variable appeared, he would still be able to control it.\n\nHowever, the current problem was very serious, because this girl walked up to him.\n\n\"I…………\" The bus owner's acting just now had been extremely exquisite, but now he couldn't even speak.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe female corpse reached out and directly flipped the bus owner onto the ground, stepping on his neck with one foot.\n\n\"Stop for a moment.\"\n\nZhou Ze called out.\n\nThe female corpse stopped, without asking why.\n\nZhou Ze walked forward, squatted down, reached out and patted the bus owner's whiskered face, then he felt that he had done something superfluous and rubbed his hand on the female corpse's trouser leg.\n\nThis guy's face was so greasy.\n\nThe female corpse: \"…………\"\n\n\"You, are there others?\"\n\nWhat Zhou Ze had to consider now was how to resolve all future troubles. He himself wasn't afraid of anything, but this matter couldn't be hidden. What if they dealt with the small ones and the big ones ran away, and the other party targeted Doctor Lin for revenge?\n\nThere's no logic in guarding against thieves for a thousand days.\n\nBefore, the little loli had said that there was a peer of hers in Rongcheng who overstepped their authority and became a judge himself. Zhou Ze naturally couldn't follow in his footsteps.\n\nAlthough emotionally, Zhou Ze was indeed very drawn to him, thinking he was very awesome and had great dreams.\n\nBut this matter had already affected his daily life; he had to personally take action to bring it to an end.\n\nThe female corpse directly smashed down on the bus owner's left arm.\n\n\"Crunch…\"\n\n\"Ahhh!!! No more, no more… It's just a few of us, we all met while working… it's just us few, we were hired by the employer.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, then looked at the female corpse and said, \"Is there any way to make them not remember this matter?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to cause trouble, and didn't even want to be in the news.\n\nThe female corpse made a throat-slitting gesture.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. Can't kill, at least, not by himself.\n\n\"Or, Boss, you can prick them with your fingernail. It can make them mentally confused for a period of time, like being drunk, and then they'll black out.\"\n\n\"Prick how much?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Just prick a little bit, otherwise they really might die. Also, I know Boss, you don't want to cause trouble. After returning, burn all your remaining joss paper money, and trouble won't come knocking. But presumably no one will throw money at your shop entrance anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and glanced at Doctor Lin in the distance, then silently walked to each villain lying on the ground and discreetly pricked them one by one with the black fingernail that had grown on his pinky finger. These few people all trembled all over, foamed at the mouth, and then quickly fell unconscious.\n\nBut, none were in life-threatening danger.\n\nHe looked around; there should be no cameras here, otherwise they wouldn't have chosen this place as the site for staging an accident. Zhou Ze picked up one of their phones, dialed the police, then threw the phone away.\n\nAfter doing all this, Zhou Ze waved to Doctor Lin over there, then got back into Doctor Lin's car.\n\nDoctor Lin also got into the driver's seat.\n\n\"Drive away first, don't stop here,\" Zhou Ze reminded.\n\n\"Okay.\" Doctor Lin took a deep breath, then started the car.\n\n\"Don't tell anyone about this.\"\n\nZhou Ze reminded during the car's journey.\n\n\"Why?\" Doctor Lin was clearly a bit unable to understand.\n\nZhou Ze pointed behind him,\n\"She is a Tai Chi Eight Trigrams Palm successor. Because she accidentally crippled someone while sparring in martial arts with others, she fled to me for refuge. It was also she who just saved me, so our identities cannot be exposed, otherwise she'll have to be arrested by the police.\"\n\nThe female corpse sitting in the back rolled her eyes. This talk was meant to fool ghosts.\n\nDoctor Lin remained silent, and he didn't know if she really believed it; she just continued to quietly drive the car.\n\nThe car still drove towards People's Hospital. For Doctor Lin, even if Zhou Ze hadn't said to go there initially, she would subconsciously drive there. After all, that was her workplace, and there, she could feel safe.\n\nThe car drove into People's Hospital parking lot; all three got out of the car.\n\nDoctor Lin didn't ask where Zhou Ze was going; she couldn't have imagined that the place Zhou Ze wanted to go was actually the emergency room. She just walked forward somewhat silently.\n\nThe female corpse leaned in and whispered to Zhou Ze's ear, \"Are you still going to confess tonight?\"\n\nShe was very smart; from details like Lin Wanqiu buying Zhou Ze's house before his death, she had actually inferred many inside stories.\n\n\"It's not like it's a Qiong Yao drama; why would I make it so melodramatic?\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nAlthough a small interlude occurred on the way, which still left Doctor Lin a bit absent-minded, Zhou Ze didn't intend to give up his original plan.\n\nA woman like this, who was also the legal wife of his current physical body,\nnot telling her the truth so she could sleep with him peacefully at night,\nhad his brain filled with water?\n\nHiding back and forth, full of twists and turns, moving and tragic, and then hysterical—that was Auntie Qiong Yao's favorite trope. He, Zhou Ze, didn't like it.\n\nDoctor Lin sat down on a long bench at the parking lot exit. Zhou Ze sat down beside her.\n\nThe female corpse very tactfully didn't come closer.\n\nThe two sat side by side.\n\nLin Wanqiu took a deep breath. Her pretty face appeared even more delicate under the moonlight.\n\nZhou Ze watched admiringly from the side,\nto have such a beautiful woman, and such a good-looking… wife,\nwho had been missing him, dead for over half a year, all this time,\nthe sense of accomplishment really went through the roof.\n\n\"About what just happened, is it really okay?\" Doctor Lin apparently hadn't completely disengaged from what had just happened.\n\n\"We didn't do anything wrong, right?\" Zhou Ze comforted her.\n\nDoctor Lin nodded.\n\n\"Just like those very brave anti-drug police, they also conceal their identities, and so do their families. This is to ensure their safety; this is a great sacrifice they make.\"\n\n\"So, you're afraid of retaliation?\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand.\" Doctor Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, preparing to pull the woman into an embrace, and then it would be \"the moment to witness a miracle.\" But Doctor Lin spoke first:\n\n\"You and her, what exactly is your relationship? Xu Le, please answer me seriously. This time, no matter what you answer, I will believe it. I will also forgive everything.\"\n\n\"It's really nothing,\" Zhou Ze said with a bitter smile. He could only say that both times were too coincidental.\n\nDoctor Lin fell silent again. Just as Zhou Ze was about to speak, Doctor Lin actively reached out and clasped Zhou Ze's hand. Zhou Ze was startled for a moment.\n\n\"Xu Le, I'm sorry. I have always loved another man. You should have already discovered it, otherwise you couldn't have appeared in that house. Although I am innocent with that man, I admit I cheated emotionally. I am sorry to you, because you are my nominal husband.\"\n\n\"It's alrea—…\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to speak, Doctor Lin spoke again:\n\n\"About our matter, I've already thought it through. Two choices for you:\n\n\"First, we divorce. I will compensate you one million yuan. The bookstore is also yours.\"\n\n\"What divorce are you talking about?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Second, I will try hard to forget that that man, will earnestly choose to live with you, to be your… true wife, to make up for what I owed you before. Xu Le, I am willing to try, to give you everything I have, to fulfill a wife's duties and responsibilities.\"\n\nAs she said these words, Doctor Lin's eyes reddened. She had resigned herself to fate.\n\n\"Okay… hey, wait a moment.\"\n\nZhou Ze's mind was a bit slow to process for a moment; this relationship was a bit messy, he had to sort it out first. Immediately after, Zhou Ze finally understood the details, and stood up in anger, pointing his finger at Doctor Lin, speaking somewhat tactlessly:\n\n\"No,\nyou must continue to cheat!\"\n\nDoctor Lin: \"…………\"\n\n\"Pfft…\" The female corpse, who was pretending to look at the scenery in the distance but was actually eavesdropping on the love affair gossip with her superhuman hearing, directly burst out laughing, then covered her stomach and squatted down,\n\"Hahahaha, I'm laughing so hard my stomach hurts!\"⁶\n\n————\n\nLong is very happy to see everyone's active presence in the chapter bullet comments. This signifies a book's popularity. Long reads the chapter bullet comments for each chapter several times, and will also record everyone's brilliant comments.\n\nSo, about what everyone jokingly said before, \"First floor⁷ makes a lot of sense,\" please don’t make this kind of good-natured joke anymore, and don’t deliberately spam this kind of reply anymore.

    "content": "「No, you must continue cheating!」\n\n\"............\" Doctor Lin.\n\nDoctor Lin's red lips parted slightly. She was a bit at a loss, and somewhat confused.\n\nHad her \"husband\" not forgiven her yet?\n\nOr perhaps her \"husband\" himself had a complex about wearing a certain colored hat?¹\n\nUnder guilt and pressure, Doctor Lin chose to compromise. In truth, of the two conditions she mentioned, as long as the choosing party wasn't foolish or overly naive, they would definitely pick the second one.\n\nThe first was to take a million yuan plus a struggling bookstore,\n\nThe second, however, was to get both her person and her money. With her person, would a million yuan still be lacking?\n\nBesides, she wasn't an ugly rich woman.\n\nHowever, for Zhou Ze, the situation he faced was more difficult.\n\nI² worked my ass off for half the day, and now you say you want to forget me, and instead prepare to accept your fate and live peacefully with that little bastard Xu Le?\n\nZhou Ze couldn't allow such a situation to happen.\n\nOriginally, he had cuckolded³ someone else, feeling quite pleased,\n\nA sense of accomplishment, *biubiubiu*⁴,\n\nNow that he was the one being cuckolded, it wasn't so pleasant.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, pointing to his face, and said very seriously:\n\n\"I'm not Xu Le, I'm Zhou Ze.\"\n\nDoctor Lin was stunned.\n\nHowever, a long silence passed between them.\n\nFinally, Doctor Lin sighed, saying:\n\n\"No matter which path you choose, I admit I wronged you, but you shouldn't mock me like this. Or, do you still harbor resentment?\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged, \"I really am Zhou Ze. I died in a car accident, but woke up inexplicably, having transmigrated into this guy's body. I don't know if you usually read novels or watch TV shows, but this kind of transmigration plot shouldn't be very uncommon.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say... it is what it is.\" Doctor Lin echoed.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that the woman in front of him probably planned to contact a psychologist for him tomorrow; if she were more drastic, she might even forcibly send him to a mental hospital.\n\nIn the distance, the sound of a 120 emergency vehicle⁵ could be heard, and the hospital building suddenly became a hive of activity.\n\n\"I'll go see.\" Doctor Lin stood up, planning to temporarily abandon her conversation with her \"husband.\" In her view, her \"husband's\" mind had been significantly stimulated.\n\nBut precisely because of this, she felt even more guilty towards Xu Le.\n\nThe female corpse, who had been eavesdropping on the gossip, came up behind Zhou Ze after seeing Lin Wanqiu leave, and said:\n\n\"Boss, why didn't you let her see your toenail fungus?\"\n\n\"Or let her see if you're cold?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nThe female corpse pouted, saying, \"It doesn't seem impossible. If she puts her hand in and feels, she should understand.\"\n\n\"I want it to be a bit more aesthetic,\" Zhou Ze said. \"As gentle as possible.\"\n\n\"Being dramatic.\" The female corpse dared to mock her boss at this moment.\n\n\"Yes, being dramatic. When you were a young lady from a good family and had secret meetings with a pedantic scholar, wasn't that also being dramatic?\" Zhou Ze stretched, \"Come on, let's go in.\"\n\n\"To the hospital?\"\n\n\"Nonsense. The commotion over there is so big, it must be a major accident. There must be many injured, and the emergency attending physicians definitely don't have enough staff. Those intern doctors don't have enough experience or guts to handle this situation.\"\n\nZhou Ze said this as he and the female corpse walked into the hospital, then directly turned into the medical staff changing room.\n\n\"But boss, what does that have to do with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze chose a lab coat roughly his size, put it on, and then tied on a mask.\n\n\"In my previous life, I was a doctor. Doctor Lin was an intern I supervised back then.\"\n\n\"Hehe, teacher-student romance.\" The female corpse also changed into a lab coat, and said with a hint of excitement, \"Boss, what should I do then?\"\n\n\"Pick a BGM for me,\" Zhou Ze said, pulling on his gloves.\n\n\"BGM?\" The female corpse was stunned for a moment.\n\n\"Because I'm about to show off.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\nA familiar feeling,\n\nI'm back.\n\n............\n\n\"Doctors now are so different from doctors back in my time.\" The female corpse felt a bit awkward wearing the nurse's uniform.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze gave a noncommittal response.\n\n\"It makes me feel a bit lost,\" the female corpse sighed. \"I feel like I'm a bit out of touch with this world. Looks like I'll have to go out more often from now on.\" The female corpse said tentatively.\n\n\"Stop kidding yourself. You even know what Wan Chai Ferry⁶ means, and you still have the nerve to say you're out of touch?\" Zhou Ze quickly retorted.\n\nThe female corpse stuck out her tongue, saying, \"Boss, what kind of doctor were you before? I heard being an obstetrician-gynecologist is pretty good.\"\n\n\"You read novels while lying in your coffin?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"What?\" The female corpse was a bit confused.\n\n\"Gold for ophthalmology, silver for surgery, dirty and tiring work for obstetrics and gynecology.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Only those on the outside who don't know, or those influenced by other literary works, would think obstetrics and gynecology is wonderful and relaxing.\"\n\nAt this moment, the elevator opened, and a stretcher cart was pushed over by several orderlies.\n\nZhou Ze immediately walked over and asked, \"What happened?\"\n\nThe intern doctor instinctively answered as if to his \"mentor\": \"Patient is unconscious.\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened. He immediately swung himself onto the stretcher cart, began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) compressions on the patient, and shouted:\n\n\"Quick, push to the emergency room!\"\n\nAt this moment, several orderlies and nurses pushed the stretcher cart inside together, while many patients and family members in the corridor could only hastily make way.\n\n\"People in front, clear the way!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nDoctor Lin, who had just finished treating a patient's wound, wiped sweat from her forehead and walked out. She looked at the figure kneeling on the stretcher cart, performing CPR, and was stunned for a moment.\n\nThen she immediately ran towards them.\n\nWhat on earth was he doing?\n\nThis was a hospital!\n\nUpon reaching the emergency room, Zhou Ze directly ordered: \"Push the crash cart, prepare for endotracheal intubation!\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The intern doctor responded. The surrounding nurses, seeing that the intern doctor had responded, naturally followed the commands.\n\nThey each thought the others knew this new doctor, which was actually the biggest misunderstanding. Of course, this was also because of the emergency situation, and Zhou Ze's tone and commands indeed made it impossible to tell he was a \"fake doctor.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood at the head of the bed, personally performing the intubation.\n\nAt the same time, he extended his hand to the left, palm open: \"Remove the guidewire.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The female nurse immediately handed the item to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze then said to the intern doctor beside him: \"Listen for the position.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The intern doctor, who had been a bit nervous before, was no longer nervous at this moment. Many young doctors are like this: they have solid technical skills, but are not really suited to working independently; they are better suited to being a 'sapper' under someone's command.\n\nHe put on the stethoscope, began listening for the position, then nodded to Zhou Ze, saying, \"Position is fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Switch, keep compressing.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnother nurse immediately came over to replace the previous one and continue CPR.\n\nAt this moment, a nurse looked at the nearby monitor and exclaimed, \"Patient is in ventricular fibrillation.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up. \"Prepare for defibrillation.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nThe intern doctor immediately took out scissors and cut open the patient's clothes. Zhou Ze replaced the previous nurse and began personally performing CPR, while also saying:\n\n\"Charge to 200 joules.\"\n\n\"Understood.\" The female nurse immediately prepared, then said, \"Charging complete.\"\n\nAt this moment, Doctor Lin pushed aside the curtain and walked in, seeing the figure organizing the resuscitation.\n\nThat's right, it was Xu Le, her husband.\n\nDoctor Lin pointed at Zhou Ze. She was furious. She didn't know what was wrong with her husband. He had just told her he was Zhou Ze, and she thought he might be experiencing hysteria, but she absolutely would not allow him to joke with a patient's life!\n\n\"Prepare to discharge, stand clear!\" Zhou Ze warned the people around him, then gave Doctor Lin a pointed look.\n\nDoctor Lin's body trembled. A familiar feeling swept through her.\n\nA familiar scene,\n\nA familiar tone,\n\nA familiar style.\n\nAt that moment, she couldn't even speak.\n\nAfter the first defibrillation, Zhou Ze continued CPR, his gaze fixed on the monitor.\n\nBut the situation didn't improve. Zhou Ze directly said, \"Again, charge to 200 joules!\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The female nurse re-prepared, then said, \"Charging complete.\"\n\n\"Stand clear.\"\n\nZhou Ze performed defibrillation again.\n\nUnder the electric shock, the patient's entire body twitched.\n\nThe intern doctor beside him continued CPR.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the monitor. It finally showed normal activity.\n\n\"Restore monitoring, get an ECG.\" Zhou Ze said to the intern doctor beside him.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe intern doctor immediately went to prepare, then handed the ECG report paper to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took it and glanced at it, saying, \"Acute myocardial infarction. Contact cardiology, prepare for emergency PCI immediately.\"\n\n\"Okay, understood.\" The intern doctor wiped his sweat, letting out a long sigh of relief.\n\nZhou Ze also walked out of the emergency room at this moment.\n\nDoctor Lin stood outside, looking at him with suspicion, disbelief, excitement, and at the same time, fear.\n\nZhou Ze directly scolded:\n\n\"What are you standing there for? So many patients! Go save lives!\n\nIf you want to cry or be scared, wait until you're off work and go home to hide in bed and cry while hugging your doll.\"\n\nDoctor Lin immediately burst into tears.\n\nHe, back then,\n\nUsed to scold her like this too.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nDoctor Lin directly rushed over, wrapped her arms around Zhou Ze, and pressed her face directly against Zhou Ze's chest.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nHe had envisioned many reactions from Doctor Lin after the confession:\n\nFear?\n\nCollapse?\n\nDread?\n\nBut he had never expected this scene.\n\n\"Holy crap,\"\n\nShe's just throwing herself into my arms?\n\nThat's it? It's okay now?\n\nZhou Ze had always been curious how he, someone so unromantic and dull in his previous life, had captured the heart of Doctor Lin, who was still an adorable young girl back then.\n\nNow he seemed to understand a little.\n\nDoctor Lin wouldn't have Stockholm Syndrome, would she?\n\nAfter being scolded and cursed at, she actually fell for him?\n\nHowever, it seems women with this symptom might also accept certain... sexual interests in bed that ordinary people find hard to accept?\n\nHehe;\n___\n¹ In Chinese culture, \"wearing a green hat\" (戴绿帽子) is an idiom for being cuckolded.\n² Zhou Ze uses \"老子\" (lǎozi), a colloquial and often rude self-reference, roughly meaning \"your father\" or \"I, your old man,\" conveying a sense of authority or exasperation.\n³ In Chinese culture, \"greening someone\" (绿了别人) is an idiom referring to cuckolding them.\n⁴ An onomatopoeic term, often used to describe something happening rapidly or playfully, like shooting.\n⁵ In China, 120 is the emergency ambulance phone number.\n⁶ Wan Chai Ferry is a well-known brand of frozen dumplings and other food products in China and Hong Kong. The joke implies the female corpse is not as \"out of touch\" with modern life as she claims if she knows about commercial brands.",

The bookstore's operations had fallen into straitened circumstances, the crucial problem being that the inheritance he received from Xu Le was simply too meager.\n\nIf it hadn't been for recovering that share from the pirated book dealers, the shop might not have been able to operate anymore.\n\nThat night, after returning from the hospital, Zhou Ze burned all the remaining hell money. He even squatted by the door, smoking half a pack of cigarettes and waiting for a while. Indeed, no one came to drop off money anymore.\n\nAccording to the female corpse, this was called using yin virtue to ward off disaster.\n\nThe hell money given by ghosts was equivalent to yin virtue. When you needed money, you could use it to \"exchange\" for cash; when you needed to avoid trouble, you could use it to offset the trouble.\n\nThe previous incident had been reported in the news: a wealthy man had hired a killer to murder his wife.\n\nThere was a rumor that the suspect said a high school girl appeared and beat them up at the time. Of course, no one would believe that.\n\nIt wasn't Sailor Moon, after all.\n\nIn any case, that matter had concluded, and Zhou Ze's hell money hadn't been burned for nothing.\n\nXu Qinglang came over from next door, holding two cups of tea. His lifestyle was becoming increasingly refined.\n\nOnce a diligent and ambitious young man,\n\nAfter acquiring over twenty apartments,\n\nHe had finally begun to indulge in pleasure and fall into a decadent rhythm.\n\nThe two sat by the counter, drinking tea together.\n\n\"What happened with your wife in the end?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"She said she needed some time to quiet down and some time to think,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe confession process had been very smooth,\n\nOne might even say it was surprisingly smooth.\n\nDoctor Lin's affection for him even showed a tendency to become \"pathological,\" but fortunately, she was still a rational person.\n\nXu Le was dead, and Zhou Ze had possessed his corpse and returned to life. All sorts of incredible things had happened before her eyes. For her to accept it all at once and continue a shamelessly happy life with her \"dream lover\" who was also her \"current husband\"—\n\nIt was a bit difficult.\n\n\"That's already pretty good. She's stronger than I imagined,\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"Most people would probably be scared crazy.\"\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal.\n\nXu Qinglang shouldn't have known about this, so it was clear someone had leaked it.\n\nHe didn't need to search to know who the leaker was.\n\nIt was Ms. Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Oh, right, I need to ask you something,\" Zhou Ze asked seriously. \"Was Xu Le this hard up when he opened the store?\"\n\n\"No, I thought he lived quite carefree. Though I didn't interact much with him before he died; he was a very dull guy, terribly boring.\n\nBut he should have had a lot of money. I remember back then he often helped out his relatives financially at the bookstore; he was quite generous.\"\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang finished speaking, he glanced at Zhou Ze again, even sticking out his tongue and licking his lips.\n\n\"You're still more interesting.\"\n\nIn an instant, his waist swayed, and his seductive eyes rippled like waves, truly making one's heart flutter.\n\n\"It's a shame you didn't become a gigolo. You could have been a king of gigolos.\"\n\n\"Can we still have a proper conversation?\" Xu Qinglang said, annoyed.\n\n\"That's a compliment.\"\n\n\"Heh...\" Xu Qinglang pointed a finger at Zhou Ze. \"You should worry about yourself.\"\n\n\"Worry about what?\" Zhou Ze gestured to the bookstore. \"Business has been sluggish lately. Never mind not seeing many living people, I haven't even seen many ghosts.\"\n\n\"How do you plan to develop things with your doctor wife? I think she just needs a period of adjustment, and then she'll accept it.\n\nAfter all, with a woman like her, honestly, you really scored. Who would have thought that in this day and age, someone like a well-bred young lady from an aristocratic family would emerge? Her parents must be oddballs too.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze nodded. His in-laws were indeed quite odd.\n\nHis father-in-law had been a hospital director and had also operated a medical company. Logically speaking, he should have been an absolute success, but in some aspects, he was quite feudal and stubborn.\n\n\"Once you tame a woman like that, she'll willingly devote herself to her husband and raising children,\" Xu Qinglang showed a look of yearning. \"I want a woman like that too.\"\n\n\"You already are one,\" Zhou Ze jabbed.\n\n\"Let's talk about your problem. You're going to live with her in the future, right?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then you'll definitely sleep together too, right?\" Xu Qinglang extended his hand, wiggled it, and continued, \"When I say 'sleep,' it's a verb that involves many complex actions and unique positions. You understand, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He still didn't understand what Xu Qinglang actually meant.\n\n\"Hmm, well, here's your problem. You're currently using Xu Le's body. If you really 'sleep,' doesn't that also mean Xu Le has cuckolded you?\"¹\n\nXu Qinglang squinted his eyes. At that moment, he smiled mischievously.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze fell into deep thought.\n\n\"Even your DNA isn't your original DNA, but Xu Le's. In other words, the child born after you've gone through this extremely complex and rich verbal process of 'sleeping'...\n\nActually isn't your child, but Xu Le's and Lin Wanqiu's child.\n\nRight?\"\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze fell into deep thought again.\n\nXu Qinglang got more and more excited as he spoke, watching Zhou Ze remain silent. He felt an indescribable delight!\n\nBack when Madam Bai had her subordinates carry an eight-bearer sedan chair to pick him up,\n\nIt was Zhou Ze who secretly pointed his finger at him.\n\nHe had that grudge noted down in his little book!\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of water, showing no emotion.\n\n\"Are you feeling very worried and adrift?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I'm the one who gets the pleasure,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned and continued, \"But this body is Xu Le's. When you 'sleep' with her, it's Xu Le's body.\"\n\n\"I'm the one who gets the pleasure.\"\n\n\"But the child's DNA...\"\n\n\"I'm the one who gets the pleasure.\"\n\nXu Qinglang suddenly slammed the counter with both hands and rebuked:\n\n\"Damn it! You can't be so open-minded about this!\"\n\n\"Anyway, I'm the one who gets the pleasure. That guy Xu Le is long gone to Hell, who knows where he's ended up. He probably drank Meng Po's soup and reincarnated. Why would I care about that?\n\nAs long as I get my pleasure.\"\n\nXu Qinglang's chest heaved with anger. He didn't know why he was angry,\n\nBut he was just so mad!\n\n\"Alright, let's stop rambling. If we keep going, it'll turn into a debate about spirit and body, almost reaching philosophical heights.\" Zhou Ze gestured to end the somewhat boring discussion.\n\n\"As long as you're happy,\" Xu Qinglang said, brimming with resentment.\n\n\"Oh, right, there's something I need to ask you,\" Zhou Ze thought of another matter.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Do you know any other ghost messengers?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I was living with my parents' departed souls before. Would I dare to go around getting to know ghost messengers?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n\"Okay, I get it.\"\n\nIt seemed he still had to find time to visit the Wenmiao. The gong-beating dwarf elder he saw last time should also be an official employee.\n\n\"What exactly do you want to ask?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I want to know if ghost messengers have performance reports or anything like that, like for promotions, raises, and benefits.\"\n\n\"Probably... they do,\" Xu Qinglang pondered for a moment. \"Look at Madam Bai; she was able to accumulate merit and return to Hell to seek an official position from being a female ghost lingering in the human realm. You should have something similar.\n\nDidn't that little loli tell you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"I also think your ghost messenger position came a bit too easily. I reckon she might have some other serious matter to deal with, so she temporarily passed the job to you to cope with.\"\n\n\"You mean I'm really just a temporary worker?\"\n\n\"Heh heh, when she's done dealing with her business, you'll probably have to vacate your spot. If she's in a good mood then, she'll just turn a blind eye to you. If she's in a bad mood, she might just drag you back to Hell.\"\n\n\"What exactly is she going to deal with?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nImmediately after, a scene from the old Daoist's live broadcast flashed in Zhou Ze's mind: the young man drinking porridge in Rongcheng.\n\nRongcheng,\n\nA Hell shop?\n\nThen, associating it with the little loli's reaction when he mentioned Rongcheng,\n\nIt seemed,\n\nIt really was possible.\n\nBut no matter what, he couldn't easily give back this temporary worker status. Living without status was not comfortable.\n\nXu Qinglang returned to his own shop. As he left, he wished Zhou Ze \"Happy Lantern Festival.\"\n\nZhou Ze was also tidying things up, and at the same time, he instructed Bai Yingying to go out and buy him a few packs of cigarettes and some tangyuan. He had to change his plans; he would go to the Wenmiao to chat with that dwarf elder tonight.\n\nJust then, the bookstore door was pushed open, and a man in a white down jacket walked in.\n\n\"Brother Le! I'm here to pick up my dad from the hospital!\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, his mind starting to figure things out. He likely guessed the man's identity: he should be his paternal uncle's son, a bit younger than himself, and a paternal male cousin of Xu Le.\n\nXu Dachuan had come to the city to see him last time and had a minor fracture in a car accident when he left. Zhou Ze had visited him once later. Doctor Lin had covered all the medical expenses, so he hadn't paid much attention since.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze replied somewhat coldly.\n\n\"Brother Le, I'm a bit short on spending money lately. You see, with my dad's fall, he'll have to recuperate for at least two months after coming home, and he can't go out to work and earn money.\"\n\nThe cousin smiled at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I've already given Uncle a nourishment allowance.\" Zhou Ze had given some, but Xu Dachuan refused to take it, so Zhou Ze secretly stuffed it into his clothes.\n\n\"Hey, Brother Le, I just started dating a new girlfriend, and money's a bit tight. Brother, could you help out your little brother?\" The cousin was directly asking for it.\n\n\"Business isn't good here,\" Zhou Ze had no intention of giving.\n\n\"Brother, that's not right of you.\" The cousin was unhappy. \"I was the one who found someone to help you with that thing last time.\"\n\n\"What thing?\"\n\n\"Brother, that's dishonest of you, denying it after the deed is done? I'm telling you, I'm not shamelessly asking you for money. Have I come to you to talk about money in the past six months?\n\nAs for that thing last time, the driver guaranteed he wouldn't spill the beans. Besides, he's been locked up for over half a year and will be out in another six months or so. Only a fool would spill the beans, right? He's definitely tight-lipped; otherwise, it would have turned from illegal driving into intentional homicide.\n\nThis time, your little brother really is tight on money, Brother. Just lend me one or two thousand. I'll pay you back when I have money, okay?\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the teacup from the counter. Hearing this, he suddenly frowned slightly and said,\n\n\"What exactly is it? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Brother, are you really burning the bridge after crossing it?²\n\nHalf a year ago, you were the one who asked me to find a truck driver and pay him to intentionally run over and kill that doctor.\n\nYou can't forget my contribution...\"\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe glass cup in Zhou Ze's hand,\n\nWas directly crushed.\n---\n¹ **Turned you green (綠了):** A Chinese idiom meaning to be cuckolded or cheated on by one's partner.\n² **Burning the bridge after crossing it (過河拆橋):** A Chinese idiom meaning to abandon or betray a benefactor after achieving one's goals; to be ungrateful.",

    "content": "「Ah Le Ge?」His cousin watched Zhou Ze crush the glass cup like that, watched the blood continuously drip from Zhou Ze's palm, and was so scared that he instinctively took several steps back.\n\n「Ah Le Ge, if you're tight on money, then forget it, really forget it.」His cousin was clearly scared, his voice even carrying a slight sob as he spoke.\n\nThey were grasshoppers tied to a single rope<sup>[1]</sup>; it wasn't a matter of who was threatening whom. Of course, he had initially only planned to scrounge some more money by leveraging this favor.\n\nIf he pushed his cousin too far,\n\nYes, his cousin was the mastermind, and him?\n\nHe was also a participant, even acting as a go-between; his crime might not be lighter than his cousin's. As for the truck driver, he was practically the killer.\n\nSo, he didn't dare push his cousin too hard; he was also afraid.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood why Xu Le had so little money on him after Zhou Ze possessed Xu Le's body: the bookstore's losses were one aspect, and the other was that Xu Le had spent most of his money on that matter.\n\nIt was absurd,\n\nridiculous,\n\nand in the end,\n\nhis own cause of death had actually turned out to be this.\n\nHe slumped back into the chair, Zhou Ze watching the glass shards stuck in his palm, watching his blood continuously drip.\n\nHe didn't try to stop the bleeding, nor did he feel much pain.\n\nIn fact, he found it rather interesting.\n\nEven the most excellent black comedy couldn't write the irony he was feeling now, could it?\n\nThe man he had always thought was cowardly,\n\nspineless,\n\nuseless,\n\neven so lowly that he felt a little pity for him,\n\nwas actually the mastermind who hired someone to kill him!\n\nEverything, after going round and round, seemed to have returned to a circle.\n\nYes,\n\nyou could say that what goes around comes around with satisfying retribution!\n\nYes,\n\nyou could understand it as karma being predestined by heaven!\n\nYes,\n\nyou could cheer,「Heaven has eyes, what goes around comes around!」\n\nBut these were all the views of bystanders. In the eyes of bystanders, they expected to see a story of evil conclude with a bad person punished and a good person compensated.\n\nThis would make bystanders feel very secure, make them feel good,\n\nmake them feel good enough to eat a few more bites of rice at dinner.\n\nHowever,\n\nwho could pay for his original life?\n\nZhou Ze slowly lowered his head, his body slowly began to twitch.\n\nA strong sense of rage began to fill his entire body.\n\nDoctor Zhou,\n\nDirector Zhou,\n\nHe had come out of the orphanage, every step thorny, every step hard-won!\n\nHe had no connections or background, yet he climbed up the hospital system purely through his own efforts and strength, adhering to his medical ethics and principles while hoping to achieve greater success and a higher position.\n\nHe was constantly on edge, treading on thin ice!\n\nHe had finally managed to climb to that position at that age,\n\nhe had finally made a name for himself in the field with his medical skills,\n\nhow much sweat had he poured in?\n\nThe countless times he motivated and encouraged himself while lying in bed late at night,\n\nand even, how many times had he gritted his teeth and swallowed it!\n\nGone,\n\nAll gone!\n\nAll because of this bastard good-for-nothing,\n\nhe found out about his wife's secret crush on him,\n\nhis own wife wouldn't sleep with him,\n\nhe felt wronged,\n\nhe was angry,\n\nhe was resentful!\n\nHe wouldn't reflect on why he had lost all dignity and willingly become a live-in son-in-law,\n\nhe wouldn't reflect on why he was looked down upon everywhere,\n\nhe wouldn't reflect on himself,\n\nnor would he examine himself,\n\nhe aimed the target of his anger at him!\n\nIf he had truly had some ambiguous relationship with his wife, then fine,\n\nbut at that time, he had long since forgotten about that cute little intern girl he had guided many years ago!\n\nHe was completely unaware,\n\nbut on his way home from work, at the traffic light intersection where he was carrying a cake and gifts, preparing to go to the orphanage to celebrate Children's Day with the kids,\n\nthe big truck driver who had taken the money,\n\njust stepped on the gas,\n\nand directly crushed the life he had fought so hard to build!\n\n「Ah Le Ge, uh, I'll get going now, please take good care of yourself.」\n\nHis cousin didn't dare stay there any longer. He turned around, pushed open the bookstore's glass door, and left. He still had to pick up his dad from the hospital, and given Zhou Ze's current state, he was genuinely afraid of agitating this cousin of his, who usually seemed gentle and weak with a bit of a literary-youth syndrome, but when he got fierce, even he found him terrifying!\n\n「I'm going to kill that guy, kill him! Using the money I got from her, kill him ahhhhhhhh!!!!」\n\nTo this day, his cousin still remembered that evening half a year ago, when his cousin had placed several wads of money in front of him, his face contorted as he said those words.\n\nThis cousin, whom he had secretly made fun of behind his back, thinking he was weak-willed, cowardly, and even willing to cling to powerful connections and become a live-in son-in-law to the point where his children couldn't even take his surname,\n\non that dusk,\n\ncompletely changed his image in his heart.\n\nWatching his cousin's retreating back, Zhou Ze's bleeding palm, his fingernails grew out repeatedly, then receded.\n\nWisps of black energy continuously swirled around his fingertips.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes also had a violent crimson and black sheen continuously intertwining.\n\nThis was his enemy,\n\none of the masterminds who murdered him,\n\nhe wanted to keep this person there forever,\n\nhe wanted Bai Yingying to treat this person as food, suck all the blood from his body dry, and turn him into a human husk!\n\nBut he just left like that,\n\nand Zhou Ze, from beginning to end,\n\ndidn't make a move.\n\nHe didn't even stand up and shout,「Stop.」\n\nRationality,\n\nThis damned rationality,\n\nthis rationality that made him despair, that almost made him collapse!\n\nZhou Ze knew clearly that he couldn't kill him.\n\nEven if he disregarded his identity as a ghost messenger and the other consequences caused by seeking revenge for himself,\n\njust consider, if he killed him,\n\nwhat would the driver in prison think after learning about this?\n\nWould he think he was being killed to silence him?\n\nThen, would he have to go and kill that driver too?\n\nYes, the driver was the primary killer who murdered him!\n\nIt was that damned bastard, who, on that night, had been watching him, and then ran a red light at the intersection and deliberately crashed into him!\n\nHis cousin deserved to die,\n\nthat driver deserved to die even more!\n\nBut if he killed both of them, no matter what method he used to conceal or set up an accident scene,\n\nthe police would definitely find something unusual.\n\nBy then, the connection would become clear!\n\nActually,\n\nthe most crucial thing was, the real person who paid to hire someone to kill was the current Zhou Ze!\n\nHe was the real mastermind!\n\nIf he wanted revenge, killing them would be equivalent to exposing himself.\n\nThey had already ruined his first life,\n\ncould it be that,\n\nhe would also destroy the chance of possessing a body that he had so painstakingly obtained, because of them?\n\nRuin himself,\n\nhis current second life?\n\nZhou Ze clenched his hands into fists and slammed them heavily on the counter.\n\n「Bang!」\n\nThe world spun for a moment,\n\nZhou Ze's body stumbled, and he staggered back several steps. His back against the corner of the wall, he slowly sat down.\n\nHis blood-soaked hands covered his eyes,\n\nhis other hand unconsciously scraped against the tiles.\n\nYou are very angry,\n\nbut you have no way to vent,\n\nThis,\n\nGoddamn life!\n\nThis goddamn manifest justice!\n\nThis absolutely bastard-like karma!\n\nIn my previous life, I saved many people, and helped many people!!!\n\nTears dripped from the corners of Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nEveryone has their vulnerable moments; the only thing they can do is cover their tearful eyes with their palms;\n\nEveryone also has times when they resent heaven and earth, complaining about the injustice of the world. Not everyone is a pure robot, always able to calmly analyze things about themselves when encountering them.\n\nIn his previous life, Zhou Ze believed he hadn't done anything against his conscience. In his hands, many patients' lives were saved, and many people's lives and families were saved by him.\n\nHe didn't let things slide, nor did he go with the flow and become corrupt. Even though he had a very strong ambition to climb the ranks and get ahead, he still adhered to his duty as a person and a doctor. And because of this, when he climbed up, the difficulties he faced and the effort required were greater than those who would compromise!\n\nIn a corner of the counter, a piece of joss paper currency lay there.\n\nIt must have been one of the joss paper currency he had burned after he returned that night.\n\nJust as Bai Yingying had said, joss paper currency given by dead people was equivalent to underworld merit.\n\nHaha,\n\nPerhaps it was because heaven saw he had accumulated too much merit in his previous life, so it compensated him in this life.\n\nAllowing him to「reborn」back, directly having a beautiful wife, allowing him to own a bookstore, and even, to show off the wisdom of its「Lord Blue Sky」<sup>[2]</sup>,\n\nallowing him to come out of hell, when his soul was swaying by the roadside, about to collapse and dissipate,\n\nhe happened to stumble upon Xu Le, who had been accidentally killed by a petty thief.\n\nAllowing him to inherit Xu Le's life.\n\nAllowing this guy, who was originally the mastermind behind his murder, to pay the price that heaven deemed appropriate.\n\nBut... who had asked if Zhou Ze agreed?\n\nSo much so that,\n\nit made him now,\n\nunable to even seek revenge!\n\nWhen that bastard walked up to him and talked about hiring someone to hit and kill that doctor,\n\nhe could only sit there dejectedly,\n\nmotionless!\n\nThe lingering glow of the setting sun,\n\nsprinkled on the corners of the bookstore's doorway,\n\ntaking away today,\n\nits last trace of lingering warmth.\n\n「Oh, right, I just developed a new strawberry juice here. Do you want to try it first so I can make some improvements?」Xu Qinglang pushed open the door and walked in, holding a wine glass.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze sitting in the corner with blood dripping from his hands, he was startled for a moment. He immediately put down the strawberry juice and ran over, squatting down beside Zhou Ze.\n\n「What's wrong with you?」Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n「Why... this isn't fair... no... this damned fairness,」Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nXu Qinglang fell silent. He didn't know what had happened to Zhou Ze to make him like this; the Zhou Ze he had always known was always very rational and composed, no matter the situation.\n\nEven within his meticulousness and rigidity, he would occasionally crack jokes with you. This was a very disciplined person, but disciplined people often become more helpless when they collapse after encountering a blow.\n\nZhou Ze at this moment made Xu Qinglang feel as if he was seeing himself on the day when the little loli took away his parents' souls in the shop.\n\nHe complained about the unfairness,\n\nbecause Zhou Ze next door was also a ghost,\n\nbut the little loli had condoned his existence and instead took away his own parents' souls.\n\nXu Qinglang sighed,\n\nreached out and put his arm around Zhou Ze's shoulders, letting Zhou Ze's forehead lean against his chest, and also chimed in:\n\n「Brother, although I don't know what happened, I can empathize with your current emotions.\n\nEven the most prodigious Chopin couldn't play out our sorrow.」\n\n---\n<sup>[1]</sup>A Chinese idiom meaning people who are in the same predicament or jointly implicated.\n<sup>[2]</sup>A legendary just and incorruptible official in Chinese folklore, often used to represent divine justice.",

    "content": "Left hand, three packs of cigarettes, right hand, a bag of tangyuan,\nA beautiful cross-body bag was slung over her shoulder.\n\nBai Yingying wouldn't waste any opportunity Zhou Ze permitted her to leave the bookstore. Heaven knew how she managed to buy a cross-body bag at such speed after getting the cigarettes and tangyuan!\n\nPushing open the bookstore door,\nBai Yingying saw a scene of two men embracing, and immediately dropped her things and covered her eyes,\nwhile simultaneously spreading her fingers and peeking hard,\nnot forgetting to stamp her feet and say coyly:\n\"Ying ying ying,¹\ndid I come back at the wrong time?\"\n\nConcubine Xu,²\noh no,\nXu Qinglang glared back at Bai Yingying, that plaintive charm of his almost dripping out like summer dew.\nThis surging resentment of a secluded woman,³\nwas terrifying!\nIt made Bai Yingying wonder if she was the zombie, or if the noodle shop owner in front of her was the zombie.\n\n\"Did you get the stuff?\" Zhou Ze stood up.\nHe tidied his clothes.\nXu Qinglang also stood up, pretending to button his shirt.\n\n\"Boss, I got everything,\" Bai Yingying replied obediently.\n\n\"Alright, I'm going out for a bit.\"\nZhou Ze walked over, picked up the cigarettes and tangyuan, and said to Bai Yingying, \"You watch the place.\"\n\n\"Got it!\"\nAfter Zhou Ze left the shop, Bai Yingying and Xu Qinglang glared at each other with crossed eyes.\n\n\"What are you looking at, corpse,\" Xu Qinglang snapped.\n\n\"If you keep hiding in the cupboard, I won't be able to see you,\" Bai Yingying retorted sarcastically.\n\n\"You're ice! Ice! Ice that can freeze into a popsicle!\"\nXu Qinglang continued his counterattack!\n\n\"Heh, your 'water route' is blocked,⁴\ntaking the 'dry route' makes it easy to encounter bandits and suffer a bloody disaster.\"\nBai Yingying sharply countered.\n\n\"Hmph!\"\n\"Hmph!\"\nThe two parted ways unhappily. Xu Qinglang returned to his noodle shop, while Bai Yingying, imitating Zhou Ze, sat in the boss's chair behind the counter, poured herself a cup of hot water, and then picked up a book, pretending to read it with great atmosphere.\n\n…………\n\nZhou Ze planned to visit the Confucius Temple. No matter how much sorrow life threw at him, he always had to bear it first, then continue living as he always did.\nIt was like the last night of a short holiday; the thought of having to wake up early for work tomorrow made one despair,\nwanting to give up entirely, yet still only able to set an alarm for oneself.\n\nThis was life. For some successful people, everyone always eagerly talked about their secrets to success, envying their current fortuitous circumstances.\nIt was like a pregnant woman who had just given birth; friends and family all came to congratulate her, but no one cared how many times she was 'f*cked'⁵ to conceive that baby in the first place.\nCoarse words, but not coarse reasoning, right?\nZhou Ze could only console himself.\n\nAs for his so-called cousin and the truck driver, how to respond to them would require a long-term plan. At the very least, Zhou Ze wasn't such a magnanimous person.\nHe couldn't act with the arrogant dominance of that colleague from Rongcheng, but this matter involved his \"murder case,\" and it certainly couldn't be lightly brushed aside.\n\nHe took out his phone, ready to hail a taxi, but happened to see a WeChat message:\n\"What are you doing?\"\nIt was a message from Doctor Lin.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, feeling somewhat ambivalent. Frankly, his mood was complicated now, because the reason Xu Le wanted to kill him was also because this beautiful female doctor had been secretly in love with him.\nAlright, being secretly loved by a beautiful woman,\nbeing secretly loved by a beautiful... wife,\nbeing secretly loved by a beautiful... and still chaste wife,\nwas indeed very gratifying and pride-inducing.\n\nBut in his previous life,\nhe was killed by her (overbearing love)!⁶\n\n\"In the shop,\" Zhou Ze still replied.\nHe wasn't Xu Le; he wouldn't be so irresponsible. His and Xu Le's winding path of karma and retribution had nothing whatsoever to do with Doctor Lin.\nAnd to be honest, after his death, as he gradually discovered Doctor Lin's obsession with him, it was impossible to say he had no feelings for this woman.\nEspecially her confession at the hospital last week,\nshe was very afraid,\nand terrified,\nher body even trembling,\nbut she still embraced him without hesitation.\nWhether God was blind or not, Zhou Ze didn't know, but Doctor Lin's existence was indeed the biggest highlight in his life since his rebirth.\n\n\"I'm on the road outside your shop.\"\nZhou Ze looked up and scanned his surroundings. Sure enough, he saw a white Maserati at the street corner.\nThe previous Cayenne had been scraped against a utility pole when he was driving that night. Clearly, Doctor Lin had gotten another car.\nOh, that wicked trend of materialism!\n\nZhou Ze walked over, opened the car door, and sat down in the passenger seat.\nDoctor Lin was a little reserved and somewhat at a loss, but it was clear that she had come to see him of her own accord, showing great courage.\nAfter all, he was a ghost.\n\n\"Xu Le, he already...\"\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. He didn't want to hear anything about \"Xu Le\" right now.\n\n\"Don't mention him. Just pretend he never existed,\" Zhou Ze interrupted stiffly.\n\n\"Then... will that make you think... I'm a bad woman?\" Doctor Lin asked.\nThree Obediences and Four Virtues,⁷\nalthough not so rigid and dogmatic, in fact, Doctor Lin was indeed deeply poisoned by feudal leftover thoughts⁸ due to her parents' influence.\nNow her husband was Zhou Ze,\nso what about the original Xu Le?\n\n\"Don't think so much.\"\nZhou Ze shook his head.\nThe reality was this humorous:\nWhen Doctor Lin learned that Xu Le was Zhou Ze, her tone of voice and demeanor became much humbler, as if she had returned to the time when she was just an intern and Zhou Ze was still her teacher.\nAt that time, Zhou Ze had not been polite at all with his interns, male or female. He directly used them as \"intern dogs,\"⁹ making them do all the dirty and tiring work, as well as buying coffee.\nAnd Zhou Ze, after the confession, slowly began to display an air of superiority in front of Doctor Lin.\nHis chauvinistic tendencies became increasingly obvious.\nThe one who is loved is always fearless.\n\n\"Okay,\" Doctor Lin nodded.\nThen,\nsilence.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want silence. He looked at Doctor Lin, noticing she was wearing a pink down jacket and jeans today. While her figure was perfectly highlighted and suited her temperament, looking very good, Zhou Ze always felt something was missing.\n\n\"Next time, wear stockings. I like seeing women in stockings,\" Zhou Ze said.\nDoctor Lin froze for a moment, her pretty face flushing.\nShe felt she should be grieving. After guessing that Xu Le was likely dead, as his wife, she should be sad, not being teased by Zhou Ze like this in the car.\nBut that feeling of embarrassed annoyance made her unable to resist.\nPerhaps,\nshe was actually a bad woman.\nA bad woman who had mentally cheated.\nDoctor Lin closed her eyes, resigned to her fate in her heart.\n\n\"I'm talking to you,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Oh... okay,\" Doctor Lin responded, her face turning even redder.\nA smile appeared at the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth.\nHe knew that the reason he spoke so boldly was partly to deliberately get revenge on Xu Le. Perhaps, he wasn't a good man either.\n\nAlright,\none thought of herself as not a good woman, the other thought of himself as not a good man.\nIn ancient times, they would almost be the reincarnation of Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing.¹⁰\nAs for Wu Dalang,¹¹ who was caught in the middle,\nwho cared?\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"Not hungry,\" Zhou Ze replied.\nThen,\nmore silence.\n\nZhou Ze now truly felt that his being a bachelor in his previous life might not just be because he was obsessed with work and had no time for anything else, but perhaps because his emotional intelligence was inherently very low.\nIt was normal for conversations with unfamiliar girls to always hit a wall,\nbut if he still had awkward silences with his legal wife, then he definitely had some issues.\n\n\"Let's just live like this. Don't tell anyone about my situation. Just pretend I'm... Xu Le,\" Zhou Ze said through gritted teeth as he uttered those two words.\n\n\"Okay,\" Doctor Lin nodded. This was what she wanted too.\nEverything, as usual.\n\n\"But there's one thing I need to remind you.\"\n\n\"Please say it.\"\n\n\"When we're in bed, you're only allowed to call me Zhou Ze.\" Zhou Ze picked his ear with his pinky finger. \"I don't want to suddenly hear you call out Xu Le. When no one else is around, you can only call my name.\"\n\"When we're in bed?\"\nDoctor Lin's heart suddenly skipped a beat.\nAlthough she had been married for a long time, she was still a virgin.\nThis kind of topic and insinuation,\nwas truly shameful!\nBut she still, as if by some strange impulse, nodded and softly assented,\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze truly felt that Doctor Lin indeed had a bit of Stockholm Syndrome.\nIf the original Xu Le hadn't been so timid, but instead simple and crude,\nhe might have gotten what he wanted, and it wouldn't have been so convenient for Zhou Ze.\nBut then again, if Xu Le had been simple and crude, he wouldn't have hated himself enough to hire someone to kill himself, right?\nSo was it better to get a chaste Doctor Lin?\nOr was it better for him to have continued living in his previous life?\nWhich one was truly better?\n\nZhou Ze reached up and patted his forehead.\n\n\"What's wrong, sir?\"¹² Doctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze with concern. \"Are you having some issues with your body because of... that incident?\"\n\nOh my gosh,\nthe \"sir\" address came out,\nmaking Old Master Zhou feel elated.\nThis Doctor Lin might not just have Stockholm Syndrome; she might also be a masochist.\nWait,\nhold on,\nsomething felt off?\n\"Issues with his body?\"\nZhou Ze immediately looked at Doctor Lin.\nHow could a man's body possibly allow for issues?\nImpossible!\n\nZhou Ze looked at the car seats; it was a bit cramped in the front.\n\"Get out,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mm.\"\nAlthough Doctor Lin didn't know what he intended, she still got out of the car.\nZhou Ze opened the back car door, pointed inside, and said, \"Get in.\"\nDoctor Lin, looking bewildered, got in.\n\n\"I need to prove that I have no issues,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\nIt was already dark by then,\nand the area around his bookstore was sparsely populated.\n\n\"Isn't your appetite poor?\" Doctor Lin, sitting in the back seat, asked with a puzzled expression.\nZhou Ze's body stiffened for a moment.\nShe meant \"issues with his body\" as in his inability to eat?\n*Phew...*\nHe let out a long breath,\nshedding his psychological burden,\nbut still needed to go into battle lightly equipped!¹³\nBut Zhou Ze still said, \"I need to prove that another aspect is also fine.\"\n\n\"What issue?\" Doctor Lin still looked bewildered.\nThen, Zhou Ze also squeezed into the back seat,\nand closed the car door.\nThe sky was dark,\nthe car was shaking,\nand they had a blast.\n\n---\n¹ \"Ying ying ying\" (嚶嚶嚶): An onomatopoeic term often used in Chinese internet slang to denote a cute, coy, or feigned whimper, often associated with exaggerated shyness or a desire for attention.\n² \"Concubine Xu\" (許貴人): A sarcastic reference. \"Guìrén\" (貴人) was a title for imperial concubines. Here, it implies Xu Qinglang's effeminate or pampered demeanor.\n³ \"Resentment of a secluded woman\" (深閨怨氣): A traditional literary trope referring to the pent-up frustration and melancholic longing of a woman confined to her private chambers, often associated with unfulfilled romantic desire or societal restrictions.\n⁴ \"Your 'water route' is blocked, taking the 'dry route' makes it easy to encounter bandits and suffer a bloody disaster\" (你水路不通，走旱道容易容易碰到劫匪有血光之災): A crude, sexually explicit idiom. The \"water route\" (水路) metaphorically refers to the female anatomy, and \"dry route\" (旱道) to the male (anal) anatomy. The implication is that if one cannot engage in vaginal sex, anal sex carries risks.\n⁵ \"Was 'f*cked'\" (被艹了): The character 艹 (cǎo) is a common internet slang term in Chinese, a vulgar substitute for the word \"fuck.\"\n⁶ \"Killed by her (overbearing love)\" (奶死的): Literally \"milked to death\" or \"suffocated by milk.\" This idiom refers to someone being overly doted upon, pampered, or even stifled by excessive care or, in this context, overbearing love/obsession, leading to their detriment or ruin. Here, it implies that Lin's intense, obsessive affection indirectly led to his death.\n⁷ \"Three Obediences and Four Virtues\" (三從四德): A traditional feudal moral code for women in ancient China, emphasizing obedience to male relatives and adherence to specific virtues.\n⁸ \"Feudal leftover thoughts\" (封建餘毒思想): A phrase used in modern Chinese discourse to describe outdated, traditional, often patriarchal or restrictive ideas that are seen as remnants of feudal society.\n⁹ \"Intern dogs\" (實習狗): A derogatory but common slang term in China for interns who are perceived as being overworked, exploited, and treated poorly, like a dog.\n¹⁰ \"Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing\" (潘金蓮和西門大官人): Infamous adulterous characters from the classical Chinese novel *Water Margin* (水滸傳) and *Jin Ping Mei* (金瓶梅). Pan Jinlian is the beautiful but promiscuous wife of Wu Dalang, who has an affair with the wealthy rogue Ximen Qing. Their story is a classic tale of illicit romance and murder.\n¹¹ \"Wu Dalang\" (武大郎): Pan Jinlian's cuckolded husband in the stories of *Water Margin* and *Jin Ping Mei*. He is often depicted as short, unattractive, and weak.\n¹² \"Sir\" (您): Used to translate \"您\" (nín), the polite form of \"you\" in Chinese. Its usage here signifies a shift in power dynamics and deference.\n¹³ \"Still needed to go into battle lightly equipped\" (依舊要輕裝上陣): Literally \"still needed to go into battle lightly equipped.\" While it can mean metaphorically approaching a challenge unburdened, in this suggestive context, it carries a double meaning of being physically unencumbered and sexually prepared for intimacy.",

    "content": "「They're in the car.」\n\nAt the bookstore entrance, Bai Yingying sat on a small stool, staring at the distant Maserati.\n\n「Ugh, a Maserati's interior isn't actually as spacious as a Cayenne. I remember last time she drove a Cayenne, didn't she?」\n\nXu Qinglang also sat on a small stool at his noodle shop entrance.\n\n「The boss scratched it while driving. Must have changed cars.」\n\nOriginally, both were minding their own business, but alas, the Female Corpse wasn't ordinary. As a being who had lain underground for two hundred years, her hearing was exceptionally good.\n\nOver these two hundred years, Madam Bai would occasionally come here to chat with her, telling her about the outside world, like boudoir confidantes.\n\nHmm, just like college dorm girls sometimes gather to discuss \"length, shortness, softness, and hardness,\"\nor watch \"educational action films\" from a certain Eastern country.\n\nBecause of this, although the Female Corpse hadn't been out for two hundred years, she hadn't fallen behind the times. When Madam Bai wasn't around, she'd listen to the sounds from the ground and above, thus cultivating extremely terrifying hearing.\n\nWhen she \"heard\" the plot seemingly sliding towards an indescribable direction, she immediately carried her stool over, simultaneously tapping the wall to signal Xu Qinglang next door to come out and watch the show with her.\n\nIt must be said, although the two usually bickered a lot, at critical moments, they knew how to share.\n\n「Oh, the boss got out of the car,」 Bai Yingying whispered.\n\n「Huh, that doctor also got out of the car,」 Xu Qinglang narrated.\n\n「Oh, the boss opened the rear car door,」 Bai Yingying continued to whisper.\n\n「Huh, that doctor got into the back seat,」 Xu Qinglang continued to narrate.\n\n「The car's shaking!」 Bai Yingying covered her mouth, her eyes fixed unblinkingly on it.\n\n「They're probably having a blast,」 Xu Qinglang inhaled deeply.\n\n「The air is filled with a sour smell. Did your kitchen's sour plum juice leak?」 The Female Corpse waved her hand, covering her nose.\n\n「Hey, bullshit. Come on, let's place bets. How long will it last?」 Xu Qinglang checked his watch and said, 「I bet ten minutes.」\n\n「Fifteen minutes!」 the Female Corpse replied.\n\n「One, two, three, four... eight, nine, ten seconds!」\n\nChalkboard notice:\n\nNote the unit of time.\n\n「Huh, the car's not shaking anymore,」 the Female Corpse said curiously.\n\n「Did they change positions?」 Xu Qinglang frowned. He refused to believe that terrible conclusion!\n\n「Change positions in ten seconds?」 The Female Corpse cackled, 「You're a greenhorn too, aren't you?」\n\nThe Female Corpse was an experienced one. Back then, Madam Bai and that impoverished scholar had trysts, and she had tasted forbidden fruit. She had experience.\n\nXu Qinglang looked displeased. As a man with over twenty properties,\nhe valued his first time more,\ncouldn't he?\n\n「The car's moving again!」 Xu Qinglang exclaimed.\n\n「One, two, three, four... eight, nine, ten seconds!」\n\n「The car stopped again,」 Bai Yingying sniffed. 「Another change of position?」\n\n「Your boss, has he never been married before?」 Xu Qinglang frowned. 「Wait, I think I checked Zhou Ze's information; it says 'unmarried.' Could he be a virgin?」\n\n「He shouldn't have been married,」 Bai Yingying replied.\n\n「That doctor's brows aren't 'open,' and her legs are 'closed'—she should also be a virgin.」 Xu Qinglang slapped his forehead forcefully and said, 「Hahahaha, I'm dying of laughter. I get it! Two virgins, playing such a high-end game for their first time.」\n\nBai Yingying remained silent beside him.\n\n「What's wrong?」 Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n「I remember, when Madam and that scholar had their first time, the scholar seemed very experienced.」 Bai Yingying looked a bit forlorn.\n\n「Ancient impoverished scholars were all sly as foxes. They loved to trick you young ladies from prominent families. In reality, they were all shameless 'old drivers'.」\n\nXu Qinglang looked like he had seen through the ways of the world. 「Holy crap, the car's moving again!」\n\nTen seconds, stop.\nTen seconds, move.\nTen seconds, stop,\nTen seconds, move.\n\nEvery time the car moved, the Female Corpse and Xu Qinglang would switch to a sideways head-tilting posture. When the car moved again, they'd switch back.\n\nBy the end, both felt their necks aching a bit.\n\nFinally, the rear car door opened.\n\nZhou Ze and Dr. Lin got out of the car, drenched in sweat, then both took their respective seats in the front.\n\n「I don't get it,」 Xu Qinglang shook his head.\n\n「Me neither,」 Bai Yingying looked equally puzzled.\n\n「Could Zhou Ze's rhythm be different from ordinary people's?」 Xu Qinglang shook his head again.\n\n「Perhaps,」 Bai Yingying guessed.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe Maserati drove away,\n\nThe show was over.\n\nXu Qinglang and Bai Yingying exchanged glances,\n\nEach huffed,\n\nAnd scorned each other silently with a 「Jerk!」\n\nThen turned and walked away,\n\nOne to the kitchen,\n\nOne to read a book.\n\n................\n\n「Phew... phew...」\n\nIn the passenger seat, Zhou Ze was panting heavily, the hair on his forehead soaked with sweat.\n\nDr. Lin drove the car, with many beads of sweat on her body, which only added to her allure.\n\n「I'm sorry, it's my fault. I wasn't attractive enough.」 Dr. Lin bit her lip, blaming herself. 「I have no experience; I don't understand this aspect, and I couldn't... make it satisfying for you.」\n\nZhou Ze leaned his head back and shook it,\n\n「It's my fault. Given how things were, it must be my fault.」\n\nZhou Ze pulled out a tissue from the front and wiped his damp hair.\n\n「We're both doctors; we understand this matter. It's truly a problem with me in this regard.」 Zhou Ze inhaled deeply, then exhaled heavily.\n\nHe now wished he could just go back,\n\nDrag Xu Qinglang out,\n\nHang him from a tree and whip him a hundred, no, a hundred times!\n\nJust now,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly remembered what Xu Qinglang had said to him.\n\nYou're using Xu Le's body,\n\nSo, did you cuckold Xu Le, or did Xu Le cuckold you?\n\nYour body is Xu Le's, your DNA is Xu Le's, and the child is Xu Le's.\n\nNormally, he wouldn't think much of it,\n\nBut at that moment,\n\nZhou Ze even felt disgusted by 'that thing' down there,\nas if he were holding someone else's.\n\nUnder this psychological pressure,\n\nAfter many attempts,\n\nHe finally achieved something that surpassed Yu the Great's—\n\nUtterly insincere!\n\n「Give me some time.」 Zhou Ze lit a cigarette, then thought better of it and threw the cigarette out the window.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze thought smoking in a lady's car was impolite; it was that he felt he didn't qualify for a post-coital cigarette.\n\n「Next time, I'll wear stockings,」 Lin Wanchu said very seriously.\n\n「Then that would definitively prove it's my problem,」 Zhou Ze said with a bitter smile. But looking at Dr. Lin's solemn expression beside him, Zhou Ze's heart immediately softened.\n\nHe even felt he was being a bit of a scoundrel,\n\nHaving, to some extent, spilled some of the anger he had just been bearing onto this woman.\n\n「I'm sorry,」 Zhou Ze said inwardly.\n\nRegardless of the complex, hateful relationship between Xu Le and himself, at least this woman was innocent, and her feelings for him were pure.\n\nIn his previous life, he seemed very successful, but half a year after his death, it seemed only she still remembered him.\n\n「Just stop up ahead. You go back; get some sleep early tonight,」 Zhou Ze said.\n\n「You also get some rest early,」 Lin Wanchu stopped the car.\n\nOnly after Zhou Ze got out did she drive away.\n\nZhou Ze had said before that their life rhythm would continue as it had been, business as usual.\n\nThere was no way not to continue as usual. Even if Zhou Ze was willing to go back and face his father-in-law, mother-in-law, and even his sister-in-law's bitter gourd faces,\n\nHe couldn't sleep lying in the same bed as Dr. Lin at night.\n\nWas he supposed to ask Dr. Lin to sleep in a freezer with him?\n\nHe wouldn't freeze to death, but what about Dr. Lin?\n\nOr call Bai Yingying over and all sleep together?\n\nZhou Ze hadn't degenerated to that extent yet.\n\nEating and sleeping, the two biggest things in life, were now restricted for him. It was truly hard to let loose.\n\nThe Confucian Temple had long since closed. It wasn't like that \"gate-washing\" event where everyone jostled to offer the first incense, with crowds of people everywhere.\n\nChinese people have always been so utilitarian about matters of ghosts and gods. Of course, this also seems to be a virtue.\n\nZhou Ze unwrapped the cigarettes he had brought.\n\nAlthough there had been a slight hitch along the way, Zhou Ze still knew what he had to do.\n\nRegardless, he couldn't just sit idly by, waiting for the Little Loli to finish her business and come back, then erase his temporary worker status, with his own fate depending on her mood.\n\nCigarettes were stuck side by side in the ground, and Zhou Ze lit them one by one. After arranging the tangyuan, Zhou Ze cupped his hands in front of him and called out:\n\n「This junior has brought some offerings to pay respects to you, venerable elder. Please, make an appearance.」\n\nAfter he finished speaking, he waited a long time, but there was still no sound.\n\nZhou Ze unwrapped another pack of cigarettes. As he prepared to light them, he noticed the long row of cigarettes he had just lit had suddenly extinguished all at once.\n\nLooking up, Zhou Ze saw the Dwarf Elder sitting on the mound in front, his pockets bulging, grinning from ear to ear.\n\n「Young man, you're showing courtesy for no reason, aren't you?」\n\nThe Dwarf Elder had a gong strapped to his back, and his face was full of wrinkles.\n\n「Indeed, I have something I wish to ask you about,」 Zhou Ze replied, adopting a very humble posture.\n\nTo be able to lead patrols by the Confucian Temple, he surely wasn't a solitary ghost. He must be someone 'within the system.' Therefore, he should know a lot about the ghost official matter.\n\n「Don't fret, let this old man calculate.」 The elder counted on his fingers, giving Zhou Ze a series of meaningful glances as he pondered, 「This old man has served the Confucian Temple for sixty years. I have some cultivation. Whatever you seek or desire in your heart, this old man can surely calculate.」\n\nUpon hearing this, Zhou Ze waited quietly beside him.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe elder suddenly slapped his thigh and said:\n\n「I've calculated it!」\n\n「Please, venerable senior, enlighten me,」 Zhou Ze asked respectfully.\n\nRegarding my ghost official status, how can I remove the 'temporary worker' prefix?\n\nAnd ultimately, what path should I take?\n\nThe elder chuckled, wearing an expression that said, 「I've already seen into your heart,」\n\nAs if everything was within his grasp.\n\nHe slowly stroked his beard and said, 「The matter you most yearn for, this old man already knows.\n\nVery well. Seeing as your courtesy is so thorough this time, this old man will point you to a clear path.」\n\nZhou Ze waited attentively.\n\n「Jiuzhitang Concentrated Liuwei Dihuang Pills.」 the elder announced.\n\n「.............」 Zhou Ze.\n\n「Huh, no? That shouldn't be. That stuff has been high quality for three hundred years;\n\nThis old man even took it when he was young and alive. It works!」\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly wanted to strangle the smug old man in front of him.",

    "content": "「Uh, did I guess wrong?」\n\nThe dwarfish old man tilted his head,\n「My spiritual cultivation has regressed again, oh dear.」\nThe dwarfish old man pulled out a cigarette and started smoking it, looking quite melancholic.\n\nZhou Ze calmed his emotions. He couldn't very well say, 'Your divination seems to have some truth to it?'\n「Senior, I'm here to ask about the Ghost Messengers.」\n\n「Ghost Messengers?」The dwarfish old man frowned.「I say, young man, what business do you have asking about Ghost Messengers for no reason? Those people aren't easy to deal with; if you encounter them, you'd best avoid them. You have a physical body, and you've come back to life—that's a great stroke of luck. Just enjoy your good fortune quietly.」\nThe old man said, clearly puzzled.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. The old man before him—could he not tell he was a Ghost Messenger?\nAlthough he was a temporary worker, judging by the old man's previous divination methods, he was definitely no half-baked practitioner. Yet he couldn't detect his Ghost Messenger identity at all.\nDid this mean that the little loli truly considered him a temporary worker, and besides the so-called \"Gate of Hell,\" she actually hadn't given him other important things at all?\n\nXu Qinglang had once said that the loli came and went in a hurry, so she definitely wasn't just looking to hand over duties. She simply had things to attend to and temporarily grabbed him to be a free laborer.\nAs for the reason she grabbed him to be a laborer, it was simple: wasn't it because she valued that he wouldn't proactively stir up trouble or cause her problems while she was away?\nBut this identity was one Zhou Ze absolutely had to grasp. He had already had one life ruined; this time, he had to hold his life completely in his own hands, and the Ghost Messenger identity was the best protective charm, preventing him from becoming an unregistered resident living in constant fear.\n\nZhou Ze spread open his palm towards the old man, revealing the mark to him.\n\nThe old man's expression immediately stiffened, then his breathing slowed for a moment, and his eyeballs swirled, before he suddenly understood and said:\n「I see. That long-tongued girl pulled you out to be her substitute.」\n\nThe dwarfish old man, with his hands clasped behind his back, walked in circles on the dirt mound, as if pondering something. Zhou Ze stood by, not making a sound to disturb him.\n\nFinally, the old man asked again,「Why do you ask this old man about Ghost Messengers? What is your intention?」\n\n「For the harmony of Hell, for the peace of the mortal realm, to better contribute my strength.」\n\n「Oh.」The old man shook his head, then nodded.「Heh, this old man knows what you want to do. You want to replace that long-tongued girl, don't you?」\n\nZhou Ze did not refute,\nnot refuting meant tacit agreement.\n\n「There are ways, and it's quite simple,」the dwarfish old man mused.「Considering you've brought me so many gifts tonight, I'll tell you.」\n\n「I'm listening intently.」\n\n「Inside the Confucius Temple live Sages; the Sages are above all. Humans walk the human path, ghosts go to the Bridge of Helplessness—the Sages see all with a single glance.\nTell me, isn't that right?」\n\n「Yes.」Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n「That long-tongued girl giving you this key is equivalent to giving you half an identity, but she can take it back at any time,」the dwarfish old man mused.「But as long as you enter the Confucius Temple, and I, this old man, personally pray to the Sages, then you make your stance clear, give your assurances, and express your resolve before the Sages.\nIn other words, say those pretty words you spoke earlier, but even prettier. As long as one of the Sages nods, your identity will be solidified.\nBut there's one thing you must remember: the Sages' gaze is like a torch, discerning all. If you harbor malicious intent, or if you do anything outrageous in the future, then what will punish you, besides the underworld laws, will be the Wrath of the Sages!」\n\n「Is that all?」Zhou Ze countered.\n\n「It is immensely difficult,」the dwarfish old man sighed.「To gain the Sages' favor and be granted an identity, this is merely one method—a method to simply give a try.」\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said,「Then let's try it.」\n\nThe dwarfish old man walked to the entrance of the Confucius Temple and blew a breath inwards. From behind the door came a 'clack' sound; it seemed the bolt of the large red wooden door had dropped.\n\n「You go in first. Have a good chat with the Sage statues. After that, this old man will make the arrangements for you.」\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pushed the door open. He looked at the dwarfish old man beside him, saw him standing still, and asked, somewhat perplexed:\n「Senior, aren't you coming in with me?」\n\n「You jest. I am merely a dog beneath the Sages' seat. How dare I idly wander before them? You have half an official status; you may enter.」\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then stepped forward and walked in.\n\nThe old man gently clapped his hands together, and the wooden door closed once more.\n\n「Have a good chat with the Sages!」\n\nThen, the old man took out another cigarette and bit it between his lips. No need for a light; the cigarette ignited on its own.\n\nAfter finishing one cigarette, the old man smiled, took down his gong and drum, and struck it hard!\nOnly a crisp clang was heard,\nThe old man, with a high-pitched voice, bellowed:\n「Dry weather, beware of fire!」¹\n\nImmediately after,\nanother gong clang echoed:\n「Dry weather, beware of fire!」\n\nThe old man, striking his gong, sang and danced at the entrance of the Confucius Temple, somewhat like a Northeast Chinese shamanic performance.²\nHis small stature made him appear even more endearingly clumsy as he bounced around.\n\n「Kid, you keep chatting with the Sage statues, express yourself more; this old man will help you reach the heavens!」\nZhou Ze's voice came from behind the wall.\n\n「No trouble at all, no trouble at all. Just bring me a few packs of cigarettes now and then, and come visit me occasionally; that'll be enough. This old man no longer has descendants, and the ancestral worship has ceased, so it's quite hard to even get a cigarette now. There's no shortage of food and drink in the Confucius Temple, but I wouldn't dare touch anything in front of the Sage Lords—not even if you gave me ten times the courage.」\n\nThe dwarfish old man laughed heartily,\nthen continued to cheerfully strike his gong.\n\n「Dry weather, beware of fire!」\n「Clang!」The gong rang!\n「Dry weather, beware of fire!」\n「Clang!」The gong rang.\n\nEach gong clang grew deeper than the last,\nand simultaneously, the mallet the dwarfish old man held, originally wrapped in white cloth, began to seep with a crimson color.\nAt first,\nthe crimson was just faint speckles, but with each successive gong strike, the color began to spread.\nIt grew thicker, and also more dazzling to the eye,\nUntil finally,\neach time the dwarfish old man struck, he would pound out a large splatter of blood, staining his clothes and transforming his formerly endearing figure with a touch of savagery!\n\n「Dry weather, be! ware! of! fire!」\n「Clang!」\n\nWith the final gong clang,\nthe dwarfish old man directly tossed the crimson, blood-soaked gong and drum he held into the Confucius Temple, and at the same time, raising his voice, shouted:\n「The Sages open their eyes! Evil spirits receive judgment!」\n\nAfter shouting that last cry,\nthe old man felt as if struck by lightning; his body became much more blurry than before, even showing a faint tendency to dissipate.\nBut he still laughed wildly, simultaneously shouting inwards:\n「Comfortable, are you comfortable now!」\n\n「No, I'm not.」\n\nZhou Ze's voice came from behind the wall.\n\n「It's good that you're not comfortable, young man. Today, this old man will teach you again what it means for things to be impermanent and for hearts to be unpredictable!\nA person's heart is a mystery, let alone a ghost's!\nThis old man is sacrificing sixty years of accumulated merit from my service just to ask the Sages to suppress and kill you!」\n\n「Do I... have a grudge against you?」\n\nZhou Ze's voice came from the other side of the wall, laced with deep confusion.\n\n「A grudge? Of course, there's a grudge!」The dwarfish old man's body flickered, but he continued to shout:「This old man doesn't reincarnate, doesn't enter the cycle of rebirth, doesn't strive for a new life!\nDay and night, I serve this Confucius Temple, attending to these revered figures,\nAll for what?\nWasn't it just to accumulate some karmic merit for my descendants, to bless them!」\n\nThe dwarfish old man cried out,\n「Is it fun, serving these clay statues every day?\nHahaha, Heaven has eyes! That day during the 'Door Cleansing' to compete for the first incense stick,³ I just glanced at you and borrowed a cigarette to smoke.\nI didn't see anything at all back then.\nBut today, just now, I did a proper divination—to hell with your Liuwei Dihuang Wan!\nYou made this old man realize through divination that you are inextricably linked to the untimely death of my last direct descendant!\nThis is the cause you created; today, you shall face the consequence!\nThis old man is exchanging sixty years of service merit for your utter annihilation,\nYou're worth it! You're not at a loss!」\n\n「Your descendant—did he die on the operating table?」Zhou Ze asked from behind the wall.\n\n「No, he didn't die on the operating table. He died in a car accident.」\nThe dwarfish old man wiped his tears, and though his form had blurred considerably, his tears seemed to carry reddish flecks.\n\n「I wasn't a driver in my last life.」\n\nZhou Ze wanted to add that he himself had been killed by a car in his last life.\n\n「That drunk-driving bastard—he should have died, his lifespan should have ended, but you forcibly saved him on the operating table, propping up his life for half a month!\nIn the end, when his time came, he died in a drunk-driving accident, but he also dragged my adorable, beloved great-great-great-grandson along with him in that car crash.\nTell me,\nIsn't this your karma?\nIsn't this the evil you created!\nIsn't this the debt you owe!」\n\n「Your thought process is truly powerful,」Zhou Ze mused.\n\nThe dwarfish old man, slowly recovering from his initial state of vengeful excitement, suddenly noticed something extremely strange. Logically, he had sacrificed sixty years of service merit to ask one of the Sages in the Confucius Temple to open their eyes.\nAccording to the usual habits of those clay Sage statues, they were lazy to death on normal days; as long as there was a ghost in their sight when they opened their eyes, even a legitimate Ghost Messenger could be suppressed and killed along with it, let alone an unofficial Zhou Ze?\n\nZhou Ze, as he was now, shouldn't he be suffering immense pain, his soul shattering and spirit dissipating under the Sages' gaze?\nWhy was his tone so relaxed every time he responded?\nThis isn't right,\nThis isn't normal!\n\n「How are you fine? How are you fine!」\n\nThe dwarfish old man suddenly roared,\nHe had just recklessly thrown away sixty years of service merit!\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the other side of the wall,\nlooking at the dwarfish old man.\n\nThe temple building of the Confucius Temple was surrounded by a rectangular wall. Previously, when Zhou Ze spoke, he had been standing outside the wall on the other side, so when the dwarfish old man stood at the main entrance, it sounded as if Zhou Ze was inside the temple responding to him.\n\nThe dwarfish old man was struck as if by lightning, looking at Zhou Ze, who had appeared outside the Confucius Temple, with an expression of utter disbelief.\n\n「How are you outside? How did you get out!」\n\nZhou Ze gestured with his lips towards the back and said:\n「You've been working in this 'unit' for so long,\nand you still don't know that there's actually a back door here?」\n\n---\n¹ **Dry weather, beware of fire!

    "content": "「You've been slacking off in this unit for so long, don't you know there's actually a back door here?」\n\nThe \"back door\" here wasn't referring to the unspoken rules of using connections; it truly meant that besides its front gate, the Confucian Temple actually had a back door.\n\nIn this world, there's no love without reason, and according to mechanics, pies falling from the sky can indeed kill people.\n\nIf the dwarf old man had only offered him a few pointers, then spoken some enigmatic words in a veiled manner, like Patriarch Bodhi<sup>[1]</sup> tapping Monkey King Sun<sup>[2]</sup> on the back of the head three times, Zhou Ze might have thought it over carefully and found it more realistic and reassuring.\n\nBut the strange thing was that the dwarf old man was simply too enthusiastic, so enthusiastic that Zhou Ze found it somewhat unreal.\n\nCould it be that ghosts have also started a trend of learning from Lei Feng<sup>[3]</sup> and doing good deeds in recent years?\n\nEspecially after the old man refused to enter the Confucian Temple with him, Zhou Ze became more cautious and wary. The Confucian Temple wasn't very large; Zhou Ze went in through the front gate, immediately exited through the back, and circled around.\n\nAs it turned out, Zhou Ze's choice was correct.\n\nJust as the old man himself had said, it's hard to know what's in a human heart, let alone a ghost's<sup>[4]</sup>.\n\nFurthermore, what Zhou Ze found somewhat absurd was that the old man's reason for seeking revenge on him was because of...\n\nHe had saved a patient, and half a month later, that patient drove drunk and got into a car accident, which also caused the dwarf old man's grandson to die in the same accident.\n\nThe dwarf old man actually redirected his anger at him, believing that if he hadn't gone all out to save that patient's life back then, his grandson wouldn't have died.\n\nWhat peculiar logic.\n\n「In my previous life, I was a doctor; healing the sick and saving lives was my duty,」 Zhou Ze said with a slight smile. 「I don't believe I did anything wrong. Your hatred for me, even to this extent, is truly unreasonable.\n\nPerhaps you just feel that your lineage has ended, that you wasted sixty years<sup>[5]</sup> serving this clay idol, and it all amounted to a fruitless endeavor<sup>[6]</sup>. So you harbor resentment and wanted to find someone to vent it on, and you chose me?」\n\nThe dwarf old man glared fiercely at Zhou Ze, licked his lips, and said in a hoarse voice:\n\n「This is the evil you've created! That person deserved to die, why did you save him!」\n\n「In a doctor's eyes, only those who die after receiving full medical attention are truly dead. I don't acknowledge your reasons, and that so-called karma is utter nonsense.」\n\nIf the karma for whatever people he saved did was going to be counted against him, wouldn't that be a complete absurdity<sup>[7]</sup>?\n\nZhou Ze remembered reading in a British veteran's memoir that during World War I, he personally captured the Führer<sup>[8]</sup> and had the chance to turn a blind eye and shoot this short fellow, but he didn't; he took him in as a prisoner of war.\n\nDid that mean all the evil deeds committed by the Third Reich<sup>[9]</sup> in the future would have to be counted against that British veteran?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head; there was no reasoning with this guy. The next moment, Zhou Ze's fingernails began to lengthen, and black energy coiled around his fingertips.\n\n「Are you going to destroy the young and take out the old one in one go too?」 the dwarf old man said furiously. 「This is the Confucian Temple, a resting place for sages! Even official ghost messengers wouldn't dare to act so presumptuously here!」\n\n「Screw you.」\n\nZhou Ze walked directly toward the dwarf old man,\n\n「I only live by one rule: you just tried to kill me, so now I'm going to kill you!\n\nIt's not convenient to avenge the grudges from my previous life right now, but if I were to let go of the current grievance, then Zhou Ze's temper would be far too good!\n\nI can't mess with living people for now, but can't I mess with ghosts?」\n\nThe dwarf old man tried to run, but Zhou Ze's hand directly seized him, and at the same time, he violently pulled him backward!\n\n「Whoosh!」\n\nThe dwarf old man let out a miserable scream, and his body became even more transparent.\n\n「I don't want to go to hell, I don't want to go to hell! Sages, save me, save me!」\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nThe clay idols in the Confucian Temple remained as still as mountains. If they truly possessed spirits, how could they have allowed the dwarf old man's family line to be completely extinguished<sup>[10]</sup>?\n\n「Who said I was sending you to hell?」 Zhou Ze smiled. 「Do you think you still have a chance to go to hell?」\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze thrust forward directly, then spread his hands wide. The malevolent energy accumulated in his heart burst forth at this moment, and the dwarf old man's soul directly disintegrated!\n\nIt was simple,\n\nand very decisive.\n\nBefore dealing with Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze hadn't realized how capable he was in a fight;\n\nAnd now, he had a very substantial confidence in his own power, especially his ability against ghosts, though the dwarf old man's easy elimination was also largely due to his soul being weakened from dedicating sixty years of service and merit.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know if doing this would have any side effects, nor was he sure if denying the old man even a chance to go to hell aligned with the little loli's \"know your limits\" philosophy.\n\nBut if he kept bottling things up like a turtle<sup>[11]</sup>, he felt he would eventually develop problems.\n\nBrushing the dust off his shoulders, Zhou Ze took out his phone and called a taxi.\n\nAfter getting into the car, the driver was very enthusiastic and even offered Zhou Ze a cigarette, which momentarily made Zhou Ze feel \"flattered and overwhelmed.\" As he smoked and casually chatted with the driver,\n\nhe also secretly used the burning cigarette tip to touch the car door,\n\nThe car door wasn't burned through.\n\nZhou Ze felt relieved, having been quite exhausted by the paper car last time.\n\nIt was around 1 AM when he returned to the bookstore. Bai Yingying was sitting behind the counter, looking at the computer and awkwardly operating the mouse.\n\nZhou Ze showered and changed, and as he was about to go upstairs to rest, he found Bai Yingying still sitting motionless behind the computer.\n\nIf she didn't go up, how was he supposed to sleep?\n\nZhou Ze walked behind Bai Yingying and discovered that the female corpse was actually playing the single-player game Beach Head<sup>[12]</sup>, very excitedly.\n\n「Time to rest,」 Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n「Oh,」 Bai Yingying responded, not quite registering it.\n\n「I said, it's time to rest,」 Zhou Ze emphasized.\n\n「Oh, okay!」 Bai Yingying stuck out her tongue, exited the game, and then obediently went upstairs.\n\nOn the second floor were two straw mats; the freezer had temporarily been moved to a corner. Each lay down on a straw mat. If an outsider were to accidentally enter the second floor and see them, they might think they were two corpses laid out on straw mats.\n\n「Boss, you must be tired today, right?」 Bai Yingying asked tentatively.\n\nZhou Ze didn't reply. He didn't want to say much about what happened tonight, especially the matter of passing his own home multiple times without entering – it was hardly anything to brag about.\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze wasn't responding, Bai Yingying obediently closed her eyes. A faint yin energy continuously emanated from her, causing the surrounding temperature to drop and allowing Zhou Ze's mind to slowly relax.\n\nHmm,\n\nTime to sleep.\n\n............\n\n「Gurgle... gurgle... gurgle...」\n\nLike the sound of boiling water,\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes and found himself floating on a pool of water. Heat waves rolled around him, as if he were lying in a large bathtub.\n\nIn the distance, there was a very wide yet muddy road, and groups of white figures were walking along it numbly.\n\nThis place felt very familiar.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat up, realizing he could actually sit on the water's surface without sinking.\n\n「You've come too.」\n\nA man's voice sounded beside Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze sharply turned his head, only then seeing a young man in a hoodie standing beside him.\n\nBeside the man in the hoodie, there was a small, crouching figure, like a cat.\n\nThe man wore his hoodie up, making his face indistinct, but he gave Zhou Ze a very familiar feeling.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze couldn't figure out who he was for a moment.\n\n「Don't be nervous, this is a dream,」 the hooded man said. 「Like Zhuangzi's butterfly dream<sup>[13]</sup>, for us dead people to dream of hell is also a very common occurrence.」\n\n「Who are you?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Does a name have any meaning here?」\n\nThe man retorted.\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily speechless. Indeed, the hooded man had made it very clear: only the dead would dream of hell. Everyone was already dead; what was the point of exchanging names?\n\n「They're coming for me,」 the hooded man said.\n\n「Coming for you?」 Zhou Ze was startled. 「To take you back to hell?」\n\n「Heh...」 The hooded man chuckled.\n\nImmediately after, the hooded man turned to leave, and the cat beside him slowly followed, preparing to depart with him.\n\nSuddenly, something clicked in Zhou Ze's mind, and he immediately said, 「Are you that person from Rongcheng?\n\nThe old Taoist's employee at the Netherworld shop?」\n\nThe hooded man stopped, turned his head, and looked at Zhou Ze. 「Employee?」\n\n「Isn't that... right?」\n\n「Sure, let's say I am. Do you know that old Taoist?」 the other party asked.\n\n「Sort of,」 Zhou Ze responded.\n\n「Oh,」 the hooded man said, pointing around. The surrounding white mist was growing thicker. He opened his mouth and said, 「The dream will wake soon.」\n\n「This is the first time I've had this kind of dream,」 Zhou Ze said.\n\n「You'll get used to it gradually,」 the hooded man said. Perhaps because of Zhou Ze's connection to the old Taoist, he wanted to say a few more words and was no longer in a hurry to leave. He pointed to the pool of water beneath their feet. 「Do you still remember this pool?」\n\nZhou Ze looked down at his feet and nodded.\n\n「Go down!」\n\nThe hooded man walked to Zhou Ze's side, placed a hand on Zhou Ze's shoulder, and then both sank into the pool.\n\nThe pool water was incredibly clear; visibility was very high underwater.\n\n「Did you notice anything missing?」 the hooded man asked.\n\n「That... that woman... she's gone.」\n\nZhou Ze surveyed the pool and realized the problem: the faceless woman he had encountered when he first went to hell was gone!\n\n「Oh,」 the hooded man responded. Immediately afterward, Zhou Ze saw two reddish glows appear beneath the man's hood; these were his eyes.\n\nBlood-red eyes!\n\nAll at once, a surge of immense fear began to well up.\n\nA terrible sense of danger suddenly descended.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails also grew long, and a black halo appeared in his eyes.\n\n「What are you going to do?」 Zhou Ze asked warily.\n\nThe hooded man smiled, pointed at him, and said, 「Look at yourself.」\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and looked at his own body.\n\nHe was startled to find that,\n\nhis body was actually entwined with layer upon layer of black hair. He hadn't even noticed when this hair had appeared.\n\n「She has already come for you,」 the hooded man reminded him.\n\n............\n\nThe morning sunlight gave a warm, pleasant feeling. Xu Qinglang brewed a cup of tea, moved his rattan chair, and sat by the shop entrance, basking in the sun. At this hour, no one would be ordering takeout, so he was happy to enjoy the peace.\n\nA taxi stopped at the intersection ahead, and a girl who looked like a high school student stepped out.\n\nThe girl was quite pretty, with a hint of baby fat on her face, already half-grown into a beauty.\n\nThe girl walked up to the bookstore's entrance. Seeing it locked, she immediately kicked the door:\n\n「Xu Le, you bastard, get out here!」\n\nBut there was no response.\n\nXu Qinglang took a sip of tea and said, 「What do you need him for?」\n\n「My sister has been on sick leave at home for over a week, shutting herself in her room every day, not eating or drinking. Xu Le, that bastard, must have angered her again!\n\nI'm calling him back today to make him apologize to my sister.」\n\n「Your sister?」 Xu Qinglang caught on. 「Your sister must have been very tired last night, right?」\n\n「What do you mean by that?」 the younger sister<sup>[14]</sup> asked, frowning.\n\n「No special meaning. Adult relationship matters, children shouldn't butt in. Just worry about your own little boyfriend,」 Xu Qinglang said, assuming the posture of lecturing a young girl.\n\n「You're a weirdo! Don't think just because you're good-looking, I won't dare hit you!\n\nOur family affairs are none of your business, are they?」\n\nThe younger sister raised her hand, indicating, 「I really am going to hit you!」\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed, and leisurely said, 「Don't worry, your sister and brother-in-law's relationship is doing just fine.」\n\nActually, there was something Xu Qinglang didn't say, but thought to himself: Doctor Lin seemed like quite a traditional woman, who knew she could be so open-minded in her fun?\n\nThe speed at which she overcame her inner struggles and embraced a new life was truly astonishing.\n\nTsk, tsk,\n\nIndeed, the power of love is truly immense and irrational. Throughout history, how many lovesick men and women have become moths drawn to this flame called love?\n\n「What do you mean by that?」\n\n「No special meaning. Never mind, let me give you a small piece of advice: tell your sister that the space in her Cayenne is larger than that white Maserati, so it's more comfortable for people to do things inside.」\n\n「Maserati?」 the younger sister asked, puzzled.\n\n「Yeah, isn't it your sister's new car?」\n\n「My sister hasn't left the house for over a week, where would she get a new car from, let alone a Maserati?」\n\nThe younger sister looked at Xu Qinglang bewilderedly, then as if something dawned on her, she suddenly kicked the bookstore door again:\n\n「Aha, Xu Le, I get it now!\n\nYou eat our food,\n\nuse our things,\n\neven the money to open this bookstore came from my sister,\n\nand now your wings are hard<sup>[15]</sup>, so you've hooked up with another rich woman, right?\n\nAnd that rich woman drives a Maserati to pick you up, right?!\n\nXu Le, you're a traitor<sup>[16]</sup>, you have no conscience!」\n\n「Crash!」\n\nA crisp sound rang out,\n\nThe younger sister was startled,\n\nShe turned her head to look at Xu Qinglang, who was lying in the rattan chair beside her.\n\nIt was the sound of Xu Qinglang's teacup falling from his hand just now.\n\nXu Qinglang opened his mouth, his face filled with horror,\n\nthen he abruptly jumped out of the rattan chair,\n\nand started frantically kicking the bookstore door:\n\n「Damn it!\n\nWake the hell up, you!\n\nWhat the hell are you still sleeping your worthless ass off?!\n\nYou really *were* up to no good that night!」\n\n---\n<sup>[1]</sup> Patriarch Bodhi: A revered immortal teacher in Chinese mythology, famous for teaching the Monkey King (Sun Wukong) his magical abilities in \"Journey to the West.\"\n<sup>[2]</sup> Monkey King Sun: Sun Wukong, the main protagonist of the classic Chinese novel \"Journey to the West.\"\n<sup>[3]</sup> Lei Feng: A soldier of the People's Liberation Army of China, known for his selflessness and modesty, glorified as a role model in China.\n<sup>[4]</sup> it's hard to know what's in a human heart, let alone a ghost's: A common Chinese saying (人心尚且隔肚皮) meaning that even among humans, it's difficult to truly know another's intentions or thoughts, implying it's even harder for non-human entities like ghosts. Literally, \"Human hearts are still separated by bellies.\"\n<sup>[5]</sup> sixty years: \"一甲子\" (yī jiǎ zǐ) is a traditional Chinese sexagenary cycle, representing a period of 60 years.\n<sup>[6]</sup> amounted to a fruitless endeavor: A Chinese idiom (竹籃打水一場空) meaning to put in effort with no result, like trying to carry water in a bamboo basket.\n<sup>[7]</sup> a complete absurdity: A Chinese idiom (滑天下之大稽) used to describe something utterly ridiculous or absurd, making one the laughingstock of the world.\n<sup>[8]</sup> Führer: The title used by Adolf Hitler to denote his role as the absolute dictator of Nazi Germany.

    "content": "Not long after Xu Qinglang kicked the door, Zhou Ze came downstairs and opened the bookstore door. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and he looked tired, as if he hadn't slept well.\n\nTo be honest, he had just woken up himself, but not naturally as usual; he had been startled awake.\n\nThe last image in his dream, the black hairs wrapped around his body, still made his scalp tingle just thinking about it.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law stood with hands on her hips, an expression that screamed, \"I need an explanation!\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded at Xu Qinglang, signaling him to come in. Then, in front of his sister-in-law outside, Zhou Ze locked the bookstore door again, isolating her outside the shop.\n\nHis sister-in-law looked incredulous.\n\nXu Le actually dared to ignore her!\n\nThe young girl's princess temper shot right up. She had come this time to demand an explanation for her sister, and she had also learned about the Maserati woman from Xu Qinglang. How could she possibly just walk away?\n\nFine, you want to lock the door, do you?!\n\nThe sister-in-law bent down and found a large stone on the ground, preparing to smash the glass door. But just as she was about to take a running start, Zhou Ze, inside the bookstore, turned and glanced at her.\n\nAt this moment, black halos swirled in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThe sister-in-law shivered, stumbled back several steps, and instinctively clamped her legs together.\n\nThe scene of being terrified in the bathroom that night resurfaced in her mind.\n\nThat night,\n\nshe had been so scared she wet herself.\n\n\"Xu Le, you... you just wait!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law uttered her last threat, then scrambled away, simultaneously grumbling to herself why she had meddled. She should just go home and tell her parents all about this.\n\nShe'd tell them that their obedient live-in son-in-law, whom they had chosen themselves, now had another woman outside!\n\n***\n\nInside the bookstore, Xu Qinglang had been organizing his words, swallowing saliva, ever since he came in. He was a man who had seen a lot, but even now, he still felt a deep lingering fear.\n\nBecause at that time, neither he, nor the female corpse, nor Zhou Ze, had seen the woman's true identity!\n\nThis was too terrifying,\n\nand chilling to think about!\n\nIt was like watching those impersonators on variety shows imitate celebrities singing, which you might find quite entertaining;\n\nBut suddenly someone imitates your parents, or your husband or wife, and lives with you, and you are completely unaware,\n\nhow terrifying a thing that would be!\n\n\"Last night, the one who came in the Maserati wasn't Dr. Lin, wasn't your wife!\n\nYour wife didn't change her car at all. She's been on leave and hasn't gone to work since you confessed to her.\"\n\nXu Qinglang finally spoke.\n\nZhou Ze's pupils slightly contracted.\n\nHe said nothing, but sat down on the chair behind the counter.\n\nIn his dream, the man in the hoodie from Rong City had already warned him, so even though he was surprised to hear Xu Qinglang's words now, he could still handle it.\n\n\"How can you be so calm?\" Xu Qinglang asked, a bit strangely. \"Or do you know who that woman is?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"At the time, I truly had no idea; I thought she was Dr. Lin.\n\nBut thinking about it now, many things don't add up.\n\nShe suddenly came to me, seeming to have let go of everything;\n\nI suddenly became very proactive and impulsive;\n\nShe was also very cooperative, every move, though seemingly shy and hesitant, was perfectly calculated to stir the most sensitive part of a man's heart.\"\n\n\"What kind of ghost was that?\" Xu Qinglang pursed his lips and re-asked, \"What kind of ghost?\"\n\n\"A woman from beside the Yellow Springs Road in Hell who likes to dance with her hands in a pool. This woman has no face.\"\n\nAs he said this,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a sense of realization.\n\nThe Faceless Woman,\n\nthose who saw her countenance always found her lack of a face horrifying and bizarre,\n\nbut they overlooked that,\n\nshe had no face,\n\nbecause she had the ability to transform into any face she needed!\n\nThis was the essence of being faceless:\n\nFrom nothing, one can create something!\n\n\"The Faceless Woman?\" Xu Qinglang frowned. \"I think I read about her in some Qing Dynasty ghost story. It's said she's a specter formed from the resentment of the deceased on the Yellow Springs Road, constantly waiting for an opportunity to return to the mortal realm.\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" Zhou Ze nodded, and added, \"Find that ghost story for me to read too.\"\n\n\"I'll look for it when I get back; it's something I read as a kid, probably can't find it anymore.\n\nBy the way, did you have relations with that female ghost?\n\nJust as you said, she came to find you to seduce you, right?\"\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up the new water cup on the counter, and took a sip of tea,\n\npretending to be profound, \"At the last moment, I sensed something was off.\n\nI sounded the gongs to withdraw the troops.\"*\n\nZhou Ze couldn't possibly admit it was because Xu Qinglang, that damned scoundrel, had talked so much nonsense about body, soul, DNA, and cuckoldry that afternoon, causing him to have a psychological block and thus fail to be successfully seduced.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze himself was puzzled. His bookstore had the most online novels in physical form, and quite a few transmigration and rebirth stories.\n\nIn those books, it was perfectly normal for protagonists to have children, and it seemed natural, without any sense of incongruity;\n\nSo why, when it came to him putting the novel's plot into practice, were there so many complications?\n\nWas he…\n\ntoo idle?\n\nNo, Xu Qinglang was the idle one,\n\nonly that clown would be bored enough to help him analyze and ponder such philosophical questions.\n\nBut it seemed he couldn't blame Xu Qinglang either. If Xu Qinglang hadn't said those things to him that afternoon, he probably would have made things irreversible by now.\n\nAnd the consequences would have been severe.\n\nWhen someone goes fishing, and you bite the hook, your fate is to become meat on the chopping block.\n\n\"She failed?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Mhm.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Then why did she target you?\"\n\n\"Maybe she's not like Madam Bai, who cares about being well-matched in social status,\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"It might be out of jealousy, because I could return, and she couldn't. Plus, I now have a physical body and a new life,\" Zhou Ze speculated.\n\n\"She's back now too, and clearly, her target is you,\" Xu Qinglang analyzed. \"This means her return isn't so pure; there might be other restrictions.\"\n\n\"For example, someone deliberately allowed her to return for some special purpose?\" Zhou Ze thought from a different angle.\n\n\"I always feel like you know something, so I'm worrying for nothing, aren't I? You already have everything figured out in your mind?\"\n\n\"I found out in a dream.\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm stupid enough to believe that nonsense?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\nZhou Ze reached up and lightly rubbed his forehead.\n\nThe little loli had hastily transferred the Ghost Constable's job to him, and the Faceless Woman was released from Hell.\n\nIt was highly likely that this was all to capture the man from Rong City, the one who had warned him in his dream.\n\nBut that Faceless Woman clearly intended to pursue her own little agenda while on official duty,\n\nfor example,\n\nto set him up?\n\n\"Anyway, for this period, I'll try not to leave the bookstore until the storm passes.\"\n\n\"That's understandable.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, then leaned closer to Zhou Ze and said, \"Hey, do you still have a hang-up about the body and DNA stuff?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Am I that boring?\"\n\n\"Actually, it's easy to get over this. DNA is just a code, but offspring are also the crystallization of one's soul. Forget it, I can't explain this topic clearly either.\n\nAnyway, even normal people who haven't transmigration or taken over another's body, might not have children that are truly their own,\n\nso you don't need to care too much about it.\"\n\n\"I never realized you were so good at comforting people,\" Zhou Ze stood up and said to Xu Qinglang, \"Come with me to the bathroom for a moment.\"\n\nXu Qinglang followed Zhou Ze to the bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze immediately took off his outer coat and inner clothes.\n\n\"You need to start exercising,\" Xu Qinglang shook his head, clearly displeased.\n\nJust then, the female corpse came down the stairs. The bathroom was just to the side of the staircase, and Bai Yingying immediately saw the two men together in the bathroom!\n\n\"Oh dear, I suddenly realized I haven't slept enough yet.\"\n\nFeigning a yawn, Bai Yingying pretended to go back upstairs to rest, not wanting to disturb the two men's private moment downstairs.\n\n\"Bring down the first-aid kit from the second floor, and prepare gauze and antiseptic medicine,\" Zhou Ze told Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Alright, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying hurried upstairs to get the items, thinking to herself, *Are the Boss and Mr. Xu going to be that intense?*\n\n*They're already preparing for bleeding?*\n\n\"What exactly are you doing?\" Xu Qinglang folded his arms, looking at Zhou Ze, a clear hint of disgust in the depths of his eyes.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"You're clearly not gay, so why do you usually act like that?\"\n\n\"Life's little quirks, don't you get it?\" Xu Qinglang pointed at Zhou Ze's abdomen. \"Even though it's someone else's body, you should really exercise more. Look at that flab, tsk tsk, disgusting.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails immediately elongated.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned for a moment.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*It's just a jab at your body, why get so angry?*\n\nHowever, the next moment, Zhou Ze gently slid the nail of his index finger downwards from his jawline. A blood trail slowly appeared, and blood beads began to seep out.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nfrom Zhou Ze's neck down to his abdomen, black powder appeared in thin lines. These powders were like ink lines used by a carpenter, very fine, previously completely invisible.\n\nAs his fingernail grazed them, these ink lines also detached.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath,\n\nlooking at himself in the mirror, and the long blood trail across his chest.\n\n\"What is this stuff?\"\n\nXu Qinglang held his breath, bent down, and examined the detached black powder.\n\n\"It's hair,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nHair wrapped around,\n\nhis soul.\n\n\"Boss, I'm coming in.\" Bai Yingying walked into the bathroom with the medicine box. When she saw the black powder on the floor, a strange look immediately appeared on her face, and she said:\n\n\"Boss, is this something you use for flirting and setting the mood?\"\n\n\"Do you recognize this?\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the black powder.\n\n\"This is Ghost Saliva Incense. It's resentment formed from old ghosts over a hundred years old. My Madam used to have some too.\"\n\n\"Tell me the effects,\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"It ignites a person's impulses. For example, if you wanted to do something at that moment, and also inhaled this, it would make you want to do that thing ten or even a hundred times more urgently.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Xu Qinglang's lips curled into a smile. He then glanced at Zhou Ze,\n\nand chuckled:\n\n\"Old Zhou, that Faceless Woman wanted to breed with you, didn't she?\"\n\n---\n* **鸣金收兵 (míng jīn shōu bīng)**: Literally \"to sound the gongs to withdraw troops.\" An idiom meaning to call a halt, to retreat, or to cease an action. Here, it is used humorously by Zhou Ze to indicate stopping an intimate encounter.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze didn't think the Faceless Woman would commit heinous acts; her limitations would only be greater than his, otherwise, she wouldn't have needed to disguise herself as Doctor Lin to get close to him.\n\nHowever, being targeted by someone like her was certainly not a comfortable feeling.\n\nShe could turn into a mall security guard, a bus driver, an old granny waiting by the roadside for you to help her,\n\nor even a sympathetic older sister in a small alley, beckoning you in for tea.\n\nAs long as you had a social network, as long as you needed to go out, she had the ability to approach you, and you had to be constantly ready for a sneak attack from anyone around you.\n\nWhat exactly she wanted from him, Zhou Ze didn't understand, but considering the many examples in tales of the strange where female ghosts like to absorb men's yang essence to replenish themselves, the Faceless Woman likely had similar motives.\n\nOr, perhaps, she wanted his body?\n\nOr perhaps, she wanted his current temporary worker status?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if the little loli knew about this, but even if she did, she probably wouldn't intervene, as it was very possible the Faceless Woman was deliberately released by the little loli's group of infernal messengers to help them with things.\n\nThe Faceless Woman hadn't directly attacked him, possibly due to other scruples. Of course, looking at the now extremely docile Bai Yingying, it was also possible the Faceless Woman was very wary of his fingernails.\n\nWhen he first entered Hell, the Faceless Woman had tried to keep him there, but he had managed to escape after injuring her with his fingernails. Perhaps that incident had indeed left a deep impression on her, forcing her to resort to a honey trap to deal with him.\n\nBut one thing also left Zhou Ze a little dispirited,\n\nthe Ghost Saliva Incense.\n\nThe urge, ten or even a hundred times stronger,\n\nhe had actually managed to control himself.\n\nZhou Ze felt no pride in his strong willpower,\n\nonly a faint, elusive sadness.\n\nSitting by the counter, casually flipping through some books, Zhou Ze also went online to search for information about the Faceless Woman, to see if he could find anything valuable.\n\nHe didn't find any valuable information, but he did find Stephen Chow's movie, *From Beijing with Love*.\n\nZhou Ze and Bai Yingying then spent half the afternoon re-watching the movie.\n\nInside, there was a villain boss who also had no face and could transform into other people.\n\nAfter the movie, it was already evening. Zhou Ze gestured to Bai Yingying to open the shop door.\n\nBai Yingying hesitated, asking, \"Boss, aren't you afraid she'll come again?\"\n\n\"Not doing business anymore?\" Zhou Ze retorted, \"Or can you contribute some burial items so I can exchange them for money to circulate the shop's funds?\"\n\nThe female corpse pouted, but still went to open the door.\n\nShe was wealthy. When Madam Bai was buried, she was, after all, a young lady from a wealthy family, so her burial items must have been considerable. Furthermore, Madam Bai had stayed in the human realm for two hundred years; it was impossible for her to take that filthy lucre with her into Hell, so it naturally remained behind.^1\n\nSeeing how many bags Bai Yingying had bought during her few limited outings, Zhou Ze knew well enough.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze had suspected the female corpse of stealing money from the shop to spend, but later, when he discovered that all the money in the shop combined wasn't enough for just a few of her bags, he stopped suspecting her.\n\nMadam Bai had, in the past, wanted to marry Xu Qinglang, who owned over twenty human residences, in a grand eight-bearer sedan chair.\n\nBai Yingying was obsessed with designer handbags.\n\nThis was definitely not good news for the single people^2 of the world, meaning that even after you died and became a ghost, life would still be tough.\n\nNot long after the shop door opened, just enough time for Zhou Ze to brew a cup of tea, a middle-aged man walked into the shop.\n\nBai Yingying stood rooted to the spot, staring at him.\n\nZhou Ze also subconsciously looked at him. Although his rational mind told him that the Faceless Woman likely wouldn't be so impatient as to change her appearance and come over again, he still had to be on guard.\n\nThe middle-aged man was wearing a leather jacket that was faded in many places, and on his feet were a pair of somewhat worn leather shoes. His trousers were casual, not particularly flashy.\n\nOn his head, he was wearing a tall hat, which looked a bit comical.\n\nThe middle-aged man walked to the bookshelf, subconsciously rubbing his hands, preparing to find a book to look at. But as he looked left and right, his brows furrowed deeper and deeper, and he complained:\n\n\"Boss, all you have here are novels and all sorts of junk. Don't you have any other readable books?\"\n\n\"There are some here.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured for Bai Yingying to move the box from behind the counter.\n\nBai Yingying did as told.\n\nThe man squatted down and continued to pick books from the box. He flipped through several in a row; their covers were all unsightly things.\n\nFor example, *A Bin*.\n\nFor example, *The Gatekeeper*.\n\nFor example, *Chen Pipi*.\n\nThe middle-aged man's fingers trembled with anger. He shoved the box forward,\n\n\"Why are you giving me these things!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was furious. He stood up and pointed at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Are all bookstore owners this shameless nowadays!\n\nA den of iniquity,\n\nA den of iniquity!\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, one foot propped on the counter, and didn't bother with the guy.\n\nThe middle-aged man indignantly turned to leave. As he reached the shop entrance, he turned his head and saw that there seemed to be some somewhat serious books on the small bookshelf by the door. He immediately stopped, picked out *An Outline of National History* by Mr. Qian Mu, and then sat down on a small stool to read.\n\nZhou Ze didn't pay him any mind. His bookstore, after all, welcomed all comers—humans, ghosts, and those who were neither human nor ghost. It was just that the current situation was a bit tense, requiring more attention to the Faceless Woman's movements.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He took it out and saw it was his sister-in-law's call.\n\n\"Hello?\" Zhou Ze listened carefully to the call.\n\nLast time, it was Doctor Lin's WeChat. This time, it was his sister-in-law's call. There was no telling if the Faceless Woman would pull the \"half-a-buttock\" trick again.\n\n\"Brother-in-law...\" his sister-in-law coquettishly purred from the other end of the line.\n\nZhou Ze immediately hung up the phone.\n\nSomething's wrong,\n\nvery wrong!\n\nWhen did his sister-in-law ever sound so gentle?\n\nThis was clearly the rhythm of actively offering half a buttock,\n\njust like Doctor Lin saying she'd wear stockings next time, that night in the Maserati.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think he had... no, rather, Zhou Ze didn't think \"Xu Le's face\" could possess the charm of a lady-killer.\n\nThe phone rang again, still her number.\n\nAfter a moment's thought, he answered the call again:\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Xu Le, you bastard, how dare you hang up on me!\"\n\nNow the character persona was normal.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze responded coldly.\n\n\"My friend and I went to study at KFC, and my wallet was stolen. Do you have any money? Just give me seven or eight thousand for emergencies.\"\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone again.\n\nHmm,\n\nIt must still be the Faceless Woman.\n\nEven if it wasn't the Faceless Woman, upon hearing \"just seven or eight thousand,\" Zhou Ze was convinced she was being impersonated by the Faceless Woman.\n\nRight,\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe phone rang again. Zhou Ze was getting annoyed, and the middle-aged man sitting there reading frowned and looked at Zhou Ze. Clearly, Zhou Ze's repeated phone rings were disturbing his reading.\n\n\"Sorry, I'll put it on silent,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe man lowered his head and continued reading.\n\nHowever, his sister-in-law was still calling non-stop, so Zhou Ze had no choice but to answer again.\n\n\"Xu Le, you can't just leave me to die! I can only ask you for this money. Can it count as me borrowing it from you?\n\nWhat if I don't tell my parents and my sister about that Maserati woman incident?\"\n\n\"You might as well tell them.\"\n\n\"............\" his sister-in-law.\n\nHoly crap, don't just give up completely like that! You still have a chance to be salvaged!\n\nAfter paying various fees last time, he only had a few thousand yuan left in his pocket. If he gave it all to her, he would starve.\n\n\"Xu Le, please, I beg you, help me out. I'll tell you the truth: I went to a disco with a girlfriend, and both our wallets were stolen. My parents and my sister can't know about this, or they'll scold me to death.\n\nMy girlfriend has to pay her painting class fees tomorrow, and her tuition was in her wallet. This can't be delayed.\"\n\n\"Tell her to ask her parents,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Her family isn't very well-off. This tuition was earned by her working during winter break, and her family won't agree to give her the money. Xu Le, please, let me borrow it from you, okay? I'll pay you back next month when I get my pocket money.\"\n\nZhou Ze still wanted to refuse.\n\nBut just then,\n\nthe middle-aged man who had been sitting quietly reading suddenly stood up.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy,\n\nveins bulging on his neck,\n\nas if in heat!\n\nZhou Ze immediately pressed down on his shoulder with one hand, restraining the guy.\n\nAt the same time, he told Bai Yingying, \"Get the money.\"\n\nBai Yingying took five thousand yuan from behind the counter and handed it to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the money with one hand, gave it to his sister-in-law, and at the same time, instructed her:\n\n\"You have to pay it back.\"\n\n\"Got it!\"\n\nHaving taken the money, his sister-in-law's gaze lingered on Bai Yingying, and she asked, \"Who is she?\"\n\n\"A shop assistant. Your sister knows her,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nIndebted to him, his sister-in-law pulled her female classmate and turned to leave the bookstore immediately.\n\nMeanwhile, the middle-aged man next to Zhou Ze made as if to chase after them, but Zhou Ze immediately turned and pressed him against the glass window with both hands.\n\nIf this guy hadn't suddenly gone mad, how could Zhou Ze have given the money so readily?\n\n\"A leopard can't change its spots, can it?\"^3 Zhou Ze said in a deep voice. \"I was still hesitating, but now there's nothing to hesitate about. I might as well send you back to Hell.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was still struggling non-stop.\n\n\"You won't shed a tear until you see the coffin, will you?\"^4 Zhou Ze laughed in exasperation. He pointed directly at the glass window in front, saying, \"Look at what hat you're wearing on your head.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked at the glass window. He saw his \"reflection,\"\n\nIn the reflection,\n\nhe was wearing a tall hat,\n\nand on the hat were four large black characters: \"Beast in Human Clothing.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man completely froze.\n\nHe instantly stopped struggling,\n\nand murmured:\n\n\"A disgrace to scholars... a disgrace to scholars...\"\n___\n^1 ^Translator's Note: \"阿堵物\" (ā dǔ wù) literally means \"that thing,\" used as a euphemism for money, often with a slightly disdainful or dismissive connotation, implying \"filthy lucre.\"\n^2 ^Translator's Note: \"單身狗\" (dān shēn gǒu) literally means \"single dog,\" a self-deprecating internet slang term for single people.\n^3 ^Translator's Note: \"狗改不了吃屎\" (gǒu gǎi bù liǎo chī shǐ) literally means \"a dog cannot change its habit of eating feces,\" an idiom equivalent to \"a leopard can't change its spots.\"\n^4 ^Translator's Note: \"不見棺材不掉淚\" (bù jiàn guān cái bù diào lèi) literally means \"won't shed tears until one sees the coffin,\" an idiom meaning \"not repent until it's too late\" or \"only facing reality when it's unavoidable.\"",

    "content": "「喲，你這偽君子？」¹\n\n許清朗剛剛打算關門，湊巧看見周澤鋪子裡有一個「客人」，過來打趣道：\n\n「兄弟，你這裝扮挺新潮的啊。」\n\n周澤伸手指了指中年男子頭頂上的高帽子，道：「這是什麼意思？」\n\n「這是最終的定論，你瞧。」²\n\n許清朗伸個懶腰，\n\n「就像是古代皇帝皇后以及層次高一些的大臣去世之後都會有一個諡號³，也像是小學生期末結束的成績證書上也會有優、良、及格、中一樣。」\n\n「所以，這頂帽子，是他死後他身邊的社會關係網給與他的評價？」\n\n「差不多是吧，這也得靠運氣，一般人死後也不是名人，也拿不到這個玩意兒，就算是名人，也鮮能有的，總之，也得靠運氣，就像是你能從地獄裡爬出來，其他九成九的鬼都得去安安心心投胎一樣。\n\n對了，我記得好像書里記載秦檜⁴死後頭頂上也有個高帽子，上面寫著『陷害忠良』。」\n\n「那岳武穆⁵頭頂上帽子就是『精忠報國』了？」\n\n「扯，戴高帽子遊街，美諡哪裡用戴帽子。」\n\n周澤鬆開手，看了看自己的右手掌心，準備把地獄之門打開，將這貨給丟進去。這貨剛剛看見年輕女生就像是發了親情的野牛一樣。這貨還不愧是個偽君子，看上去也確實文質彬彬的，帶著點書生氣質。\n\n「要送我下去麼？」中年男子此時像是安靜了下來。\n\n「否則呢？」周澤反問道。\n\n「可以讓我把這本書最後一卷看完麼？」中年男子從口袋裡取出了一張冥鈔。\n\n「嘿，你打發叫花子呢？」一邊的女屍忍住不譏諷道，「看來你生前確實混得很失敗啊，就連親人都沒給你什麼香火供奉。」\n\n死人親自給出的冥鈔，和活人燒的冥鈔不同，當然，一般死人的冥鈔多寡確實和親人的供奉多少有一定的聯繫，但其中也是有一些界限，否則使勁燒就能燒出陰間首富了？\n\n中年男子抿了抿嘴唇，帶著懇切的目光看著周澤：「求求你了。」\n\n許清朗在旁邊點了一根煙，沒說什麼，這是周澤的事兒，他不方便插口。\n\n周澤看了一眼中年男子手中的那本《國學大綱》⁶，道：「這書我以前看過，在我看來，這本書里有好幾處明顯的錯誤。」\n\n「任何具備學術價值研究的書都會有自己的錯誤，錯誤，也是前人的積攢。」中年男子正色道。\n\n「但全都是吹好話的書，有什麼意思？」周澤反問道。\n\n「曾國藩⁷給曾紀澤的信中有過這麼一句話『不可輕率評譏古人』，老闆你雖然開著書店，但你畢竟不是讀書人。\n\n錢穆先生寫這本書的背景是抗戰時期，寫這本書時，錢穆先生已經做好了亡國的最壞打算，他寫出這本書，是想著日後如果真的亡國，還能有人可以靠著這本書在後半夜偷偷摸摸地品讀，回味我們祖先的文明和傳承。\n\n批判和諷刺類的書，自然看得更加能讓人過癮，但日後若是真的亡國了，有人看見這本書，面對全是譏諷和批判，誰會再有心向故國心向中華的情緒？」\n\n中年男子講的頭頭是道，一隻手拿著書另一隻手不停地揮舞著。\n\n像是講台的老師正在給學生講述自己的道理，\n\n很激動，也很投入。\n\n「你是老師吧？」許清朗笑著問道，「哦，我說的是生前。」\n\n「我是一名中學語文老師。」中年男子回答道。\n\n「果然是偽君子。」許清朗冷哼了一聲，「我去睡了，晚安啊周老闆。」\n\n許清朗擺擺手，離開了書店回去了，那搖曳的身姿，很是婀娜。\n\n周澤轉過頭看向白鶯鶯，「他剛剛的那個背影，是不是很像你那個時代青樓裡的龜公？」\n\n「我那個時代麼。」白鶯鶯很認真地思考著，然後搖搖頭，道：「花魁都沒他好看。」\n\n周澤撇撇嘴，對白鶯鶯的回答也沒太大的意外。\n\n中年男子重新坐下來看書，似乎沒心思去猜測周澤是否答應，多看一點才是最重要的，興許還能在黃泉路上多品味一會兒。\n\n想了想這個傢伙之前看見年輕女生時的躁動，周澤都替他躁得慌。\n\n「老闆，我看他挺有學問的。」女屍小聲說道。\n\n「你家夫人以前勾搭的窮酸書生，學問也挺好吧？」周澤問道。\n\n白鶯鶯點點頭。\n\n「這個說不準。」周澤也有些難以去定量，只得道：「季羨林⁸先生在日記中有『我今生沒有別的希望，我只希望，能多日幾個女人，和各地方的女人接觸』的記載。」\n\n「文人果然都好色。」白鶯鶯嘀咕道。\n\n「男人都好色。」周澤修正道。\n\n白鶯鶯看向周澤，嬌嗔道：「老闆你就很有定力啊。」\n\n「去把衛生間馬桶刷一遍。」\n\n「…………」白鶯鶯。\n\n也不知道為什麼，周澤沒急著打開地獄之門把中年男子給放進去，而是在中年男子對面坐下來，拿出手機，隨便著刷著網頁。\n\n「你叫什麼名字？」周澤問道。\n\n對方沒回答，似乎沉浸在看書的氛圍里。\n\n「不回答書就沒得看了。」\n\n「任薪篤。」\n\n周澤點點頭，當他正準備試著搜搜這傢伙名字看看這傢伙以前的花邊新聞時，書店門再度被推開。\n\n小姨子，去而復返。\n\n「又回來做什麼？」周澤站起身，下意識地伸手去按住中年男子的肩膀，他生怕這個傢伙再度發情。\n\n不過，讓周澤有些意外的是，中年男子還是安安靜靜地坐在那裡看書，完全沒有躁動的跡象。\n\n咦，這次學乖了？\n\n小姨子拿出手機對著書店照了一圈還照了周澤，然後發送了過去，隨後點開語音道：\n\n「姐，我都說了我今天下午都在徐樂書店裡看書你就不信。\n\n好啦好啦，我這就回去，馬上回去行不啦。\n\n真是的，想安安靜靜看會兒書都打擾人家。」\n\n發完語音，小姨子吐了吐舌頭，長舒一口氣，道：\n\n「好險，還好我還沒來得及打車，不然就露餡兒了。」\n\n「小小年紀，別去那些烏煙瘴氣的地方，容易吃虧。」\n\n周澤還是提醒了一句，哪怕她不是自己的小姨子，這純粹是一個中年大叔對小晚輩的勸導。\n\n「行啦行啦，徐樂你怎麼變得跟我姐一樣了。」小姨子顯然沒聽進去。\n\n「那個女生呢？」周澤問道。\n\n「她回家了啊，我剛看著她打車走的，她家住得有點遠哦。我本來也想打算打車走的，正好我姐來微信查崗問我做什麼。」\n\n「錢呢？」\n\n「錢當然給她帶回去啦。」小姨子有些無所謂道：「放心啦，不就是五千塊錢嘛，等我發零花錢了還你就是了。」\n\n「你還？」周澤問道。\n\n「對啊，不是我還還是她還麼？\n\n她父親癱瘓在家，母親擺早點攤，生活很不容易的，我也不想看她再吃苦打工了。\n\n還有哦，她中學時曾被班主任猥***褻過，所以現在才這麼沉默寡言的。\n\n我拿她當好姐妹，這不就得多照顧一點她麼？\n\n行了，徐樂，今天就這樣了，我先回去了。」\n\n小姨子擺擺手推開書店門走了出去。\n\n周澤重新在椅子上坐了下來，一會兒看看手機，一會兒看看眼前正在認真看書的中年男子。\n\n然後自言自語道：\n\n「侵犯自己班上的學生，被發現後，還跳樓自殺了。」\n\n中年男子繼續看書，像是完全沒聽到，但是他的高帽子，是那麼的清晰，也是那麼的刺眼。\n\n古代犯人需要在臉上刺字，以此表明身份，打為下等人，和眼前這頂高帽子，有異曲同工之處。\n\n白鶯鶯幹活的速度很快，沒辦法，原本她也算是千金小姐大家閨秀，但奈何現在人在屋檐下不得不低頭，再加上周澤有一些潔癖⁹，無疑讓她的工作量確實大了一些。\n\n「老闆，累死我了。」\n\n白鶯鶯脫去了外套，她也是不怕冷的，只穿著一件短袖手裡拿著抹布就走了出來。\n\n年紀看起來很小，但發育得挺好。\n\n「老闆，他怎麼看我沒反應？」白鶯鶯有些納悶道。\n\n「你是死人。」\n\n「但我也很漂亮啊。」白鶯鶯做了一個媚態的姿勢。\n\n「算了吧，你下面這麼冷，哪個男人進去估計就得直接凍得硬梆梆永垂不朽了，連偉***哥都不用吃了。」\n\n「沒你這麼埋汰人的老闆。」白鶯鶯白了周澤一眼，「對了，剛老闆你那小姨子又回來了？我在衛生間裡聽到她聲音了。」\n\n「嗯，回來又走了。」\n\n周澤忽然想到了什麼，\n\n不對啊，\n\n如果眼前這個中年男子對白鶯鶯沒感覺那是因為白鶯鶯是殭屍的話，\n\n那麼他怎麼剛剛對自己小姨子也沒感覺？\n\n排除法，很容易就能得到一個答案：\n\n那就是這貨只是對小姨子身邊的那個女生有感覺。\n\n網上搜的新聞報導因為要保護被侵犯女生隱私，所以沒有照片。\n\n有些事兒，\n\n經不起思量，\n\n也經不起考慮，\n\n慢慢地，\n\n周澤琢磨出味道來了。\n\n小姨子看起來很潑辣的樣子，但實際上心大無比，跟個大傻妞一樣。\n\n「喂，那個女孩是不是你的那個學生？」周澤開口問道。\n\n中年男子繼續看書，沒回答。\n\n周澤直接伸手把對方手中的書抓過來，「我問你話呢。」\n\n中年男子抬起頭，看著周澤，然後點了點頭。\n\n「你到底有沒有侵犯過她？」周澤又問道。\n\n中年男子還是沒回答。\n\n「再不好好回答我現在就把你送地獄去了。」周澤威脅道。\n\n「書看完了，可以上路了。」中年男子站起身，看起來很是灑脫。\n\n「你學文天祥¹⁰是吧？」周澤諷刺道。\n\n「不管她怎麼樣，終究是我的學生，沒教育好她，是我的責任。」中年男子這般回答。\n\n「意思就是我剛看的新聞報導是假的，你沒侵犯她，她故意給你身上潑髒水要學校賠償？」周澤抿了抿嘴唇。\n\n那麼事情就很好想了，小姨子錢包應該也是那女生偷的，順帶再編造個理由，再讓小姨子給她五千塊。\n\n一個家庭貧困打了一個寒假工的女生會把五千塊學費帶在身上跑去迪廳瘋鬧？\n\n小姨子這是上了人家的套了。\n\n「告訴我，你到底有沒有侵犯過她。」周澤伸手抓著中年男子的肩膀，很認真地問道。\n\n中年男子沉默了一會兒，道：「這是我的事，和你沒有關係。」\n\n「去你丫的，那是老子的五千塊錢！」\n\n周澤很想一巴掌扇飛他，但留手了，抬高了手，甩在了對方帽子上，但在碰到對方帽子時，周澤感覺自己掌心燙了一下，有些疼。\n\n這帽子，\n\n好硬，\n\n居然讓自己的指甲位置產生了些許刺痛感，\n\n再看即使整個人被帶動著甩飛出去，但那頂帽子，依舊穩穩地紮根在中年男子的頭上。\n\n周澤想到了許清朗之前說的那句話：眾口鑠金¹¹。\n\n這帽子，\n\n不管真假，\n\n都是脫不掉了。\n\n---\n¹ `衣冠禽獸 (yīguān qínshòu)`: Literally \"a beast in human clothes,\" meaning a hypocrite or a scoundrel who pretends to be a gentleman.

    "content": "「Mom, I’m home.」\n\nThe girl pushed open the front door, called out, and heard the sound of her parents arguing from the inner room.\n\nWhether she had returned or eaten dinner was unimportant in her parents’ eyes.\n\nHer father was paralyzed and bedridden; though he could move slightly, he could do nothing else except barely relieve himself into a spittoon.\n\nHer mother had to set up a breakfast stall outside every day, working from dawn till dusk.\n\nLogically, their family atmosphere should have been like many TV reports and newspaper articles depicted,\n\nImpoverished, resilient,\n\nYet not without familial warmth and harmony.\n\nAnd she, too, should have had excellent grades, bringing credit to her parents.\n\nBut perhaps fairy-tale-like stories were, after all, rare,\n\nHer own home was truly very different from the similar reports she had previously read.\n\nHer father, paralyzed at home, had not managed to cultivate his character; his temper was very volatile, especially towards her mother, who worked outside every day. He frequently scolded her, saying she had found another man outside, a lover.\n\nHe called her mother shameless, a whore.\n\nHer mother would argue with her father every time, and then her father would smash things and roar.\n\nThis man’s strength for the rest of his life was probably all spent on lying in bed and cursing people.\n\nYet, she couldn’t entirely sympathize with her mother, because the small pieces of jewelry and some clothes her mother occasionally wore home were clearly not the kind her mother would buy herself;\n\nMoreover, once when she was with her boyfriend at a hotel, she ran into her mother—who was supposedly out buying ingredients—and another man entering the same hotel as them.\n\nAt that moment, both parties almost entered the same elevator; if she hadn’t reacted quickly and told her boyfriend she needed to go to the restroom first, a terrible embarrassment might have occurred.\n\nThis was a broken home,\n\nIt looked like it was on the verge of collapse, and indeed, it was leaking from all sides.\n\nShe didn’t know why her mother didn’t divorce her father, nor did she understand why her father, lying in bed, having lost the ability to work and earn money, and even to do housework, had not the slightest bit of self-awareness.\n\nIn any case,\n\nShe habitually opened the door with her key,\n\nHabitually heard her parents arguing,\n\nHabitually walked into her small room in the attic,\n\nHabitually poured herself a glass of cooled boiled water,\n\nHabitually opened her latest model Apple laptop,\n\nHabitually took out her newly bought gentle makeup remover,\n\nHabitually opened a video by her favorite beauty vlogger,\n\nHabitually logged into Zhihu.\n\nThis was her life, and her current rhythm.\n\nFor her, the Gaokao had long been an unattainable dream, as her grades were so poor that she had already despaired.\n\nShe had some regrets,\n\nRegretting that in middle school, she shouldn’t have claimed her homeroom teacher had molested her just for those tens of thousands of yuan.\n\nAt that time, her mother was very agitated, and her father was very agitated. After she told them about it, her mother didn’t go out to set up her stall for several days, called over a few relatives, and they carried her paralyzed father on a stretcher to the school gate.\n\nThe couple cried bitterly in each other’s arms,\n\nIn utter misery and woe.footnote:[An idiom from a famous Song Dynasty poem, evoking a profound sense of desolation and sorrow.]\n\nReporters came upon hearing the news, like sharks scenting blood.\n\nMorality and ethics, the absence of humanity,\n\nWere often the hottest topics for reporters at the time, as they didn’t cross any lines, posed very low risk, but could yield immensely huge hot-topic effects.\n\nIn short,\n\nThe turn of events for that incident was somewhat unexpected for her.\n\nAt first, she merely wanted a bit more pocket money to buy clothes.\n\nHer homeroom teacher, who was also her Chinese language teacher, knew about her family’s situation and had sometimes helped her out financially; he would even pay some of her tuition and miscellaneous fees in advance.\n\nOccasionally, Teacher Ren’s mother would also invite her to eat at their home.\n\nTeacher Ren was not yet married,\n\nAnd coupled with her frequently visiting his office and home,\n\nIt indeed gave many people the opportunity to spread baseless rumors.\n\nRumors and gossip already existed before she made her public accusation, but at that time, she didn’t care.\n\nAlthough, she had also heard them.\n\nAfter one time she secretly went to a bar to have fun and was seen by the teacher on her way out, the teacher became cold towards her; he seemed very disappointed, with her.\n\nHis mother no longer invited her to eat,\n\nHe even stopped paying some of her tuition and miscellaneous fees in advance,\n\nNor did he help her out financially anymore,\n\nWhich made her very angry.\n\nThen she used the threat of being molested to demand money from the teacher; she needed money, the lipsticks she fancied, the clothes she fancied, the purchasing agent items she fancied, all required money to buy.\n\nBut the teacher refused her, even when she threatened to expose the matter.\n\nEven now, she still felt that her middle school homeroom teacher was indeed a man of letters.\n\nAt that time, he even pounded on the table and scolded her, saying, 「Justice resides in people’s hearts.」\n\nHowever,\n\nWas that truly the case?\n\nAfter the matter exploded,\n\nHe was directly suspended by the school.\n\nThe enormous pressure from public opinion eventually made him collapse.\n\nHe had furiously fought back,\n\nWriting lengthy rebuttals online,\n\nSpeaking in pedantic language,\n\nEven though she was only a middle school student then, just an academic failure, she could tell at the time that the teacher’s rebuttal was very weak and powerless.\n\nAlthough seemingly authoritative, full of righteous integrity, and unafraid of rumors.\n\nBut in the eyes of outsiders, this was stubbornly refusing to admit guilt, being self-righteous, and trying to muddle through by relying on his teacher’s status.\n\nThe teacher had taught Chinese language his entire life, teaching batch after batch of students how to write good compositions, but his 「compositions」 were poorly written.\n\nWhat the outside world and public opinion wanted to see was not his style of writing; moreover, his authoritative rebuttals and sarcasm, imbued with a 「Lu Xun」 style, further irritated the nerves of public opinion.\n\nWhat,\n\nWe are all wrong?\n\nOnly you are wise?\n\nImpossible.\n\nThen came an even stronger backlash.\n\nNowadays, when celebrities get caught in scandals, they immediately have to hire PR companies to calm the situation through various manipulations.\n\nIf it were just a matter of reasoning and presenting facts, if things were truly that simple,\n\nThen most PR companies would starve.\n\nAnd at that time, another piece of news was dug up: one of the teacher’s uncles was a section chief in the local Education Bureau.\n\nA very minor section chief, over fifty years old, who usually adhered strictly to morals, he was also an old pedant who enjoyed studying the School of Mind. Consequently, his interpersonal relationships were very poor, and at fifty, he had no chance of further promotion.\n\nBut for the outside world, this news only needed a short headline: 「Depraved Teacher’s Background Revealed!」\n\nEverything completely exploded.\n\nPeople indulged in venting their 「rage,」 feeling that they were fighting against dark forces and influential figures in society,\n\nThe media enthusiastically sought traffic and exposure,\n\nThis was a gluttonous feast incited by her.\n\nFinally, it ended with the teacher’s leap from the teaching building.\n\nAnd the tens of thousands of yuan the school had initially compensated her family to smooth things over and resume normal teaching also 「sealed the verdict」 on this incident.\n\nIf they weren’t guilty,\n\nHow could they possibly pay compensation?\n\nRight?\n\nAfter learning of the teacher’s death,\n\nShe suffered for one night, then regretted for a month.\n\nShe suffered for one night because she still had a conscience;\n\nShe regretted for a month because she discovered that if she had waited until she went to university to do something like this again, she could have profited even more, for instance, a guaranteed spot for postgraduate study, or more compensation.\n\nShe took a wallet from her pocket; it belonged to a girl named Lin Yi, who was her classmate.\n\nThe wallet contained a good amount of cash and many VIP cards.\n\nA mocking smile appeared on her lips: 「Heh, rich people.」\n\n「Rich bitch.」\n\nShe then took out the five thousand yuan from her pocket and put it into her locked small drawer. She felt that today’s haul was good. In fact, she had received many donations afterwards, all split fifty-fifty with her parents.\n\nShe removed her makeup, and washed her hair,\n\nShe reopened the webpage,\n\nLogged into Zhihu,\n\nToday, she was preparing to write about her day’s life.\n\nFor example, she had a brother-in-law who owned a bookstore, a sister who was a doctor, and a father who ran a pharmaceutical company and had also been a hospital director.\n\nShe wrote that today, a classmate who had supposedly been molested by a teacher, but was actually a green tea bitch,footnote:[A derogatory slang term in Chinese for a seemingly innocent and pure girl who is manipulative and calculating underneath.] lost her wallet. She felt contempt for her, yet still took five thousand yuan from her brother-in-law and gave it to her.\n\nBecause five thousand yuan, for her, was just a fraction of her monthly pocket money.\n\n「Just consider it pity for this green tea bitch.」\n\nShe had a large number of followers who paid attention to her updates; as soon as she posted a message, many people would come to reply and like it. She loved this feeling; here, she found her new life.\n\nSometimes, she even found it difficult to distinguish between the virtuality of the internet and the reality of real life.\n\nShe felt she was Lin Yi.\n\nOf course, some people also mocked her, saying she looked down on the poor, relying on her wealthy family background, like a snob.\n\nShe calmly replied: 「Who care?」\n\nShe closed her laptop, preparing to rest. Staying up late was a woman’s natural enemy; she needed to take good care of herself. Her physical appearance seemed to be the only truly valuable thing her parents had left her.\n\nShe went to the bathroom to wash up.\n\nHer parents’ argument continued. Her father was smashing cups and cursing her mother, and her mother cursed him back, calling him a good-for-nothing, asking why he didn’t just go die,\n\n「Go find a car on the road and lie down under it, then the compensation would at least be a man’s duty to the family.」\n\nShe listened and smiled,\n\nAfter washing up, she returned to her bedroom.\n\nOpening the door,\n\nShe found someone sitting on her bed,\n\nA man,\n\nThe man was smoking,\n\nThe ash was flicked into the lid of a newly bought skincare product.\n\nFor a moment, she didn’t know how she should face this man.\n\nThe laptop she had closed was now open again by the man,\n\nThe man was reading her posts on Zhihu.\n\nSilence,\n\nLasted for about three minutes.\n\nShe finally asked tremblingly, 「What are you doing here?」\n\nShe knew him, had just seen him—Lin Yi’s brother-in-law, the one who owned a bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze stubbed out his cigarette in her skincare product.\n\nHer mouth twitched; that product was very expensive, she had only bought it after accompanying an old man once.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her with a half-smile,\n\nThen said very seriously:\n\n「Pay up.」",

    "content": "In the room, the girl didn't say anything. Zhou Ze slowly placed the second smoke, then took out a box of the girl's foundation and turned it on. It seemed that he planned to continue using it as a cigarette ashtray.\n\n\n\nOf course, the quarrel between the girl’s parents outside continued, and the girl’s mother started crying, saying that the man had no conscience, and then the man started crying, saying that the woman had changed.\n\n\n\nThe girl slowly raised her head and looked at Zhou Ze:\n\n\n\n\"Big brother, I don't know what you mean. Lin Jing and I are good friends, and you are her brother-in-law, so we should...\"\n\n\n\n\"Buzz\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took out a dagger from his pocket and barbed it on the girl's desk\n\n\n\nThis is one of the burial objects of the girl. She said that the iron is as sharp as mud, which is a shame, but it is indeed very delicious.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to play \"Nine-Yin White Bone Claws\" like Mei Chaofeng when facing ordinary people, because that means a lot of trouble, and Zhou Ze was most afraid of trouble.\n\n\n\nA dagger,\n\n\n\nA sound of \"buzzing\",\n\n\n\nThe competition passed thousands of words\n\n\n\nThe girl's face began to change slowly\n\n\n\nZhou Ze originally thought that things should be done. He came here just to get back the money he gave and also take back the money bag of the silly sister-in-law.\n\n\n\nHe didn't expect too many outlines, even he thought that the best outcome was that the girl was hit and killed by a car when she left the door.\n\n\n\nThe person in Rongcheng's front car is still there.\n\n\n\nZhou Cheng had to do something extra-legal punishment.\n\n\n\nHe is not that leisurely, nor has he had that kind of sentiment\n\n\n\nHe only has money because he is worth it\n\n\n\nSometimes, life really requires a lot of courage, especially when you look around.\n\n\n\nMy wife is very rich. I buy my own house as a souvenir and open a cayenne. My sister-in-law is also very rich. Five thousand pieces are just part of a month’s pocket money.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang has more than twenty suites.\n\n\n\nWhite jeans also have funeral objects.\n\n\n\nI have money around me, but I just have to squeeze my hands with money\n\n\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze still underestimated the girl\n\n\n\nA girl who had already entered society and had long been accustomed to \"knife\", at this time, the coldness she showed was revealed.\n\n\n\nIt can almost make people feel cold\n\n\n\nThe girl unbuttoned her clothes.\n\n\n\nOnly one set of underwear is left.\n\n\n\nBut next,\n\n\n\nHer underwear is ready to be unbuttoned\n\n\n\n\"You are going to kill someone.\" The girl smiled at the corner of her mouth, and she was shocked in her eyes. Instead, she was very deep, so deep that it made people feel a little incredible.\n\n\n\n\"You come and kill me.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl took the initiative to take a step towards Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\n\"My father was in bed, he had no ability to stop you\n\n\n\nMy mother and I are both women and can't beat you\n\n\n\nYou come and kill it,\n\n\n\nKill our whole family”\n\n\n\nThe girl walked to Zhou Ze, her voice sounded calmly\n\n\n\nZhou Ze looked at the girl, and admired the other person's body\n\n\n\n  only,\n\n\n\nIt's definitely a little headache\n\n\n\nThis place,\n\n\n\n There is no need to avoid being cold\n\n\n\n  and,\n\n\n\nShe seemed to be sure that she didn't want to kill anyone\n\n\n\nZhou Ze regretted it a little. If he had known that he should have come here and let women come to deal with women, it seemed the most suitable way.\n\n\n\n\"Or, I'm shouting now and you're going to be strong and raped by your illegal entry.\" The girl lowered her head and let her young face roll in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\n\"Then, my parents will hear my voice coming, the neighbors will come, and there will be someone to call the police, and you will be disgraced.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze smiled and said, \"Is it true that I can't tell you my money this time, but I also have to give you another money to save you?\"\n\n\n\n\"You're not short of money, right?\" The girl raised her lower body slightly. Her lower body was round and her bones were very delicate. Even her eyelashes were full of charming postures of the young girl. \"Lin family, very rich.\"\n\n\n\nBut I'm so terrible\n\n\n\nZhou Ze spoke helplessly\n\n\n\n\"A thousand pieces, I'll sleep with you once.\" The girl stared at Zhou Ze, stuck out her tongue and licked her lips, \"It's here, right here, right next to my parents' room, what's going on?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt the breath of an old driver coming,\n\n\n\nShame,\n\n\n\nAll the shame,\n\n\n\nAfter the last three families left their homes,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt that the girl in front of him was rich enough to lead him into the door\n\n\n\nBut her skin looks very beautiful.\n\n\n\nBut inside,\n\n\n\nSome poisonous\n\n\n\n\"Your teacher was also forced to death by you at the beginning,\" Zhou Ze asked\n\n\n\nThe girl was stunned for a moment, slightly bent her eyebrows, and was a little surprised at why Zhou Ze knew about this.\n\n\n\n\"He is good to you, he often takes you, and asks you to eat at home if it is inconvenient. He has never touched you, and you are involved in saying that he has violated you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry for him.\" The girl said with all her favours, \"He didn't touch me, but I really didn't expect that he would be so stupid that he jumped into the building and killed me. At that time, he just wanted to pay some money at school.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your parents, you know it too,\" Zhou Ze asked\n\n\n\n\"Of course\" the girl smiled slightly, stood up straight, and looked at Zhou Ze, \"How did you know these?\"\n\n\n\n\"You do this, it's wrong,\" Zhou Ze said seriously\n\n\n\nHe raised his hand slightly and imitated the scheming of the middle-aged man reading books in the bookstore:\n\n\n\n\"He deserves his conscience and his professional ethics, and these are the things he values the most, and you have destroyed them all.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are here to teach\" the girl couldn't understand the brain around her.\n\n\n\nAll his clothes were removed, and only he had to unbutton his last button. As a result, the man in front of him was taking classes with him hereShe had met a guest before, who was a good professor and was generous in his actions. Before doing things, she also taught her to study hard and not do this. The girl should respect herself and ask to teach her.\n\n\n\nThen the professor asked him for seven times in one night\n\n\n\nThis kind of person is the most vulgar. He is obviously planning to uncover the belt, but he still wants to wear a gentleman with you.\n\n\n\n\"You should give your teacher a name, he was trapped,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\n\"What to worry about\"\n\n\n\nThe girl took two steps back and put on her clothes. She knew that the man in front of her was not interested in her.\n\n\n\n\"Respect the conscience, the conscience of being a human being\"\n\n\n\n\"The conscience of being a human being\" the girl put her hands on her hands and pretended to be a joke, \"I don't want to be a human being. If there are any choices, I want to be a ghost.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, that's it?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up,\n\n\n\nThe two hands were stuck behind the body, and the nails had completely grown out.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a black aperture began to flow in Zhou Ze's eyes, and the whole person's temperament changed instantly.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, my careless sister-in-law saw her like this and was so scared that she was incontinent.\n\n\n\nThe girl in front of her also changed her face and sat down on the ground with a \"thump\" sound, pointing at Zhou Ze, so scared that she couldn't speak.\n\n\n\n\"You...you are human or ghost...\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took out five thousand pieces of money from the drawer, and his sister-in-law's money bag and put it in his pocket.\n\n\n\nAs for the other things inside, he was not interested\n\n\n\nHe just came back to take away the money he was cheated on.\n\n\n\nReasonable and legal\n\n\n\nHe doesn't want to do other things\n\n\n\nWhen leaving, Zhou Ze lowered his waist, reached out and lifted the girl's chin, and said to her very seriously:\n\n\n\n\"I wish you were a ghost now. In that case, I would never have the chance to reincarnate you.\"\n\n\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze left this home with a strong storm\n\n\n\nAnd the girl was sitting there, her body kept slamming\n\n\n\n …………\n\n\n\nWalking outside, Bai Baoyu was waiting there. She was chewing gum. When Zhou Ze came out, she took the initiative to open a piece of chewing gum and put it into Zhou Ze's mouth as if\n\n\n\n\"Boss, the money is back.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze’s point head\n\n\n\n\"Where is that girl?\" Bai Baobao didn't care about money. She sold more than one of her funeral items for this little money. She just cared about the girl's departure.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, her boss abused herself very much, so she was looking forward to how her boss treated the girl's\n\n\n\n\"At home.\" Zhou Ze began to prepare for a car\n\n\n\n\"I died at home,\" Bai Baobao asked\n\n\n\n\"What's wrong with her?\" Zhou Ze replied\n\n\n\n\"Why?\" Bai Baobao was puzzled, \"That kind of woman should be punished.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's not what I should do,\" Zhou Cheng said calmly\n\n\n\n\"Boss, you're so upset\"\n\n\n\n\"The teacher said it doesn't matter to me, so I'm going to make trouble for myself.\"\n\n\n\nAs he said, Zhou Ze stretched out his finger and pointed to the surrounding flower gardens and continued:\n\n\n\n\"Again, I don't know how many red eyes are hidden here, waiting for me to make a mistake.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze is not sure what the person in Rongcheng will be in the future, and he is not sure. Xiao Luoli may have joined forces with other ghost messengers to suppress him. Even the faceless woman on Huangquan Road was released to participate in this operation.\n\n\n\nOf course, because he owed the other party a favor in his dream, Zhou Ze hoped that he could survive this incident safely\n\n\n\nHowever, if he can't just be a judge if he learns himself\n\n\n\nHe was a doctor in his previous life. He only saved people, but did not kill people.\n\n\n\n  Bai Bao returned to the store by car. Along the way, Bai Bao didn't say a word. Obviously, she was very dissatisfied with Zhou Cheng's rehabilitation.\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to the bookstore, Zhou Ze saw the middle-aged man still sitting there reading a book. He didn't run. Even if Zhou Ze said he wanted to send him into the ground, he still didn't run.\n\n\n\n\"Pour me a glass of water.\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Baobao\n\n\n\n\"I'm tired, go and rest.\" Bai Baobao snorted and sat down directly behind the cabinet.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sat down in front of the middle-aged man without saying anything\n\n\n\n\"Who else is there in your house?\"\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man spoke and raised his head, \"The parents have passed away, only one sister.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tell me the way your sister contacts me, or tell me the address\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took out his mobile phone, clicked a video, and the sound was emitted from it:\n\n\n\n\"Or, I'm shouting now, saying that you are planning to enter the house illegally,..., and then my parents will hear my voice coming, the neighbors will come, and there will be someone to call the police, and you will be disgraced...\"\n\n\n\nThe scenes at that time were recorded in the mobile video\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man had slightly lip, a little excited and confused, and then hesitated in the battle:\n\n\n\n\"If this is announced, it will ruin her life.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then, who is responsible for your life and the kindness of the schools you have connected to and your relatives and wives,\" Zhou Cheng said indifferently, \"and you are responsible for the reputation of the teacher.\"\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man looked stunted and then pointed, \"Okay, I'll tell you my sister's address.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the middle-aged man revealed his address, his body gradually became virtualized and gradually seemed to be integrated into the underground.\n\n\n\nI have finished reading the book,\n\n\n\nThe thought was over,\n\n\n\nHe didn't need Zhou Ze's forced delivery, so he went into the ground and went to the ground.\n\n\n\nA true book reader, you can walk wildly\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sent the video to Bai Bao, and Bai Bao said with a surprise: \"Boss, as long as his sister handed this video to the police, he should not have to wear a hat when walking on Huangquan Road.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ha...\" Zhou Ze smiled, \"I can't take off the hat.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why did this happen? This incident turned around.\" Bai Baobao was a little confused, \"Justice is in the hearts of people.\"\n\n\n\n\"Usually, the news clicks and discussions about a firefighter's death on the Internet are far more than the news of a pet dog being abused.\"\n\n\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Bai Baobao obviously didn't understand. She just came into contact with the network and only played some single game games.\n\n\n\n\"You know, what do people pay attention to when it comes to something?\"\n\n\n\n\"For example, this matter must be the truth of the matter.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, people only care whether the 'truth' they see is interesting\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze stretched out his finger and pointed at the top.\n\n\n\n\"It is still unknown how many people who put him on that hat will see the news of the reversal. Even if a small number of them see it, you guess what reaction will they have.\"\n\n\n\n\"Shame, hard to bear\"\n\n\n\n\"If you do something wrong face to face and be criticized by others in person, normal people will feel guilty and difficult.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's right?\"\n\n\n\n\"But with a screen, most people usually have only one reaction.\"\n\n\n\n\"What reaction?\"\n\n\n\n  \"oh\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh.\" Bai Baobao didn't understand and asked, \"And what?\"\n\n\n\n\"Then should you fuck me?\"",

    "content": "His sister-in-law's wallet was sent back by Zhou Ze via anonymous express delivery.\n\nHmm, the shipping fee was cash on delivery.\n\nThe two thousand yuan originally inside had been pocketed by Zhou Ze. Anyway, that girl has a lot of pocket money, so he just considered it his labor fee for helping her retrieve the wallet. Zhou Ze felt his charge was quite reasonable.\n\nThen the next day, Zhou Ze saw his sister-in-law post on WeChat Moments:\n\n\"This thief has such professional ethics. They stole my wallet but express delivered my cards and ID back. There are still so many good people in this society.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the WeChat Moment and was silent for a while.\n\nForget it, it's better for the silly girl to stay silly. Simpletons have simpletons' luck.\n\nBai Yingying secretly delivered the USB drive, with the beginning and end of the video edited out, to the middle-aged man's sister's home. His sister reported it to the police station that same day. A few days later, the local police's official Weibo also released this news.\n\nThis matter also caused quite a stir. Many people denounced that girl's shamelessness and heartlessness, but its popularity was completely incomparable to when the incident first occurred.\n\nMoreover, those who are now scolding this girl probably also called that teacher a \"beast in human clothing\"¹ back then.\n\nIn short, days passed quietly like this. Business remained sluggish as usual. Bai Yingying became even more addicted to the internet, progressing rapidly. She also gradually became obsessed with online games, sitting there for a long time every day just reading dungeon guides.\n\nA full-fledged internet addict girl.\n\nAt dusk, Zhou Ze ate at Xu Qinglang's as usual, accompanied by Xu Qinglang's newly developed strawberry juice.\n\nZhou Ze felt that he was slowly starting to taste some flavors when he ate.\n\nAfter the meal, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang shared a cigarette as usual.\n\nXu Qinglang held his phone, browsing Weibo, at leisure.\n\nZhou Ze noticed that Xu Qinglang's restaurant business had become increasingly deserted recently, and fewer delivery riders were coming and going. Of course, this wasn't due to a business downturn or a decline in Xu Qinglang's restaurant's reputation; it was simply because the man in front of him was getting lazier and lazier.\n\nBut according to Xu Qinglang, the problem was with Zhou Ze.\n\nHe himself toiled from dawn till dusk, yet next door, the person just sat in the bookstore, not moving an inch. How could he possibly feel balanced?\n\nCome on, he's a man with over twenty apartments!\n\nWhy was he still not living as comfortably as the pauper next door?\n\nSo he should live well when he should, enjoy when he should, and rest when he should.\n\nHe's fallen.\n\nZhou Ze sighed inwardly.\n\n\"Hey, there have been quite a few strange things happening in the East District lately,\" Xu Qinglang said, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\nThe East District is to the east of Tongcheng City's urban area, slightly off-center. The Confucius Temple and the City God Temple are both there. On weekdays, it's only lively during festivals and holidays, since many people go there to offer incense.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked, flicking his cigarette ash.\n\n\"Look at this post: someone on Weibo said that last night, when they passed the Confucius Temple, they saw a few historical costume cosplay enthusiasts. When they walked over to say hello, they suddenly disappeared.\"\n\n\"Here's another one, saying that someone was taking their parents for a walk after dinner in the woods behind Confucius Temple Street and saw people reciting poetry and composing couplets there.\"\n\n\"And another one, posted by a driver, said that when they drove past the Confucius Temple area, they heard many people crying by the roadside.\"\n\nConfucius Temple?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. This matter seemed to be somewhat related to him.\n\n\"However, these incidents have made the Confucius Temple popular again. It's said that more people have been going there to burn incense recently, claiming it has become more spiritually potent.\" Xu Qinglang sighed.\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze pondered his own affairs.\n\n\"Logically, it shouldn't be like this. The Confucius Temple is where Confucian sages reside. There shouldn't be any wandering spirits causing trouble there,\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\n\"There probably are, but someone might have managed them before,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What about now? What happened to the one who managed them?\"\n\n\"I killed him.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nLeft with no choice, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying came to the Confucius Temple together after nightfall.\n\nLast time, Zhou Ze had beaten that dwarf elder to oblivion here, then simply brushed his sleeves and left, taking nothing with him.\n\nBut looking at recent events, it was clear: without the dwarf elder's control, those scholar specters who previously served as an honor guard were slowly becoming restless and gradually starting to let loose.\n\nZhou Ze was a grim reaper, so this matter naturally fell under his jurisdiction. Not to mention, he was the one who had eliminated the dwarf elder. It was indeed his mess to clean up.\n\n\"Boss, these specters actually can't amount to much. They'll just vanish into thin air in a couple of months. Before, they were only supported by the Confucius Temple's system. As long as they didn't cause trouble, the grim reapers would turn a blind eye and ignore them.\n\nNow that they've lost their restraints, once they've bounced around for a few days and vented their grievances, those who are destined to vanish will vanish, and those who are destined for hell will go to hell.\"\n\nBai Yingying, having been taught by Madam Bai, actually understood matters of ghosts and spirits more thoroughly than Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I can't rest easy without seeing the situation here. It's better to collect them all if possible,\" Zhou Ze said, tilting his head slightly, searching for any lingering scholar specters nearby.\n\nThose scholars from past dynasties who failed to pass the imperial examinations or committed suicide due to setbacks on their academic path, many of their specters came to the vicinity of the Confucius Temple with immense resentment, and from then on, were drawn by its spiritual aura, becoming the Confucius Temple's \"honor guard.\"\n\nOf course, there must be others who were just faking it, definitely not all of them were so-called scholars. After all, when the forest is big, all kinds of birds will be there².\n\nThose scholars were nothing more than reciting poetry, composing couplets, and weeping. Li Baojia of the Qing Dynasty once wrote in the sixth chapter of his \"A Brief History of Civilization\":\n\n\"Scholars' rebellions never succeed in three years³. Whether they're doing it or not, there's no need to pay attention to them.\"\n\nBut Zhou Ze worried that if other 'things' also gained 'freedom' among them, they might cause some incidents. If something really happened, he would certainly bear some responsibility when it was ultimately investigated.\n\nBut tonight was quiet. Zhou Ze had smoked half a pack of cigarettes, and Bai Yingying was simply lying on the grass, eyes half-closed. Not a single ghost could be seen.\n\nGrowing somewhat impatient, Zhou Ze reached out and slapped Bai Yingying's ample, firm spot, watching the flesh undulate.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Shout a couple of times, lure those ghosts out.\"\n\nBai Yingying rolled her eyes at Zhou Ze, clearly ignoring his suggestion. Having spent a long time together, Bai Yingying had also figured out some of Zhou Ze's personality quirks and dared to properly play coy, ensuring Zhou Ze wouldn't be annoyed.\n\n\"Life is but a dream; let me pour a toast to the river and moon. My soul wanders through the old country, truly, things have changed and people are no longer the same.\"\n\nA man's voice came from behind that tree.\n\nImmediately after, a man wearing long boots and official robes walked out. The man had a long beard, symbolizing dignity, a square face, and an upright posture. One look and you could tell he was an official.\n\nNo, one look and you could tell he had been an official in his lifetime.\n\nAnd he still had a long queue (braid) behind his head.\n\nBai Yingying slowly stood up, looked at the man in front of her, and then said in surprise:\n\n\"Boss, no wonder I haven't seen those scholar specters tonight. So he swallowed them all!\"\n\nZhou Ze also saw it. This man looked remarkably distinguished, but inside his belly, many small points of light could be seen. They should be the scholar specters he had swallowed.\n\n\"Heh heh, a prime minister's belly can accommodate a boat⁴. I am no prime minister, but I once held the rank of one of the Nine Ministers⁵. This belly of mine has no problem holding these fallen scholars from successive imperial examinations.\"\n\n\"Alright, you're the one. Go down.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to open the gates of hell and drag this guy down.\n\nThe other party had indeed swallowed quite a few scholar specters. He looked quite vibrant and energetic, much better than the usual specters who often came to his bookstore to read.\n\nBut he wasn't really at a level to make Zhou Ze wary.\n\nThey're all ghosts, but whether they have a physical body or not is truly a different matter.\n\nAnd he still had his fingernails.\n\n\"Are you the local grim reaper?\" The man looked at Zhou Ze and said reservedly, \"You do have the qualifications to be on equal footing with this official.\"\n\n\"Oh, such a big tone. Is the Great Qing Dynasty dead?\" Bai Yingying scoffed.\n\n\"When men speak, is there a place for you women to interject? Step back from this official,\" the man reprimanded with considerable authority.\n\nBai Yingying cracked her knuckles, making a crisp sound.\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze, who was on the other side preparing to open the gates of hell, and said:\n\n\"This officer, I held official rank and once commanded a significant position⁶. Even if I am to be sent down, it shouldn't be so casual, should it?\n\nFurthermore, in my lifetime, I once encountered a judge from the Underworld. That judge said that I would die on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year.\n\nThis official trembled with fear and was anxious all day long, finally enduring until that day. But after that day, this official did not die.\n\nThis clearly shows that this official is blessed with good fortune, and even the rules of the Underworld do not apply to this official. Therefore, this official advises you not to waste your efforts.\n\nWhen this official finishes touring the old country, if I wish to go down, I will naturally go down. Perhaps after I go down, I can even secure a position as an Underworld Supervisor. If we meet again in the future, you will still have to kneel and salute me, respectfully calling me 'Your Excellency.'\"\n\n\"You, sir, really are asking for a beating,\" Bai Yingying laughed.\n\n\"No, this means the customs in his hometown are simple and pure; otherwise, he would have been beaten to death before he even grew up.\"\n\n\"Preposterous! Hmph, this official is too lazy to engage in such verbal sparring with you. This official did not speak falsely. If you intend to forcibly escort this official to hell, then be prepared to incur this enmity.\n\nEven a judge of the Underworld couldn't accurately determine this official's death date, let alone a mere grim reaper like you?\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to open the gates of hell anymore. He just found the man in front of him quite interesting. And, to be honest, modern ghosts were nothing special, but ancient ghosts...\n\n...were truly rare.\n\nPeople often say that precious cultural relics are historical records. The one in front of him was truly a historical 'repeater machine' in the literal sense.\n\n\"You have a queue behind your head, but what you're wearing isn't a Qing Dynasty official's robe,\" Zhou Ze observed carefully for a while, then continued, \"It should be a Ming Dynasty official's robe.\n\nNo, you just said you once held the rank of Nine Ministers, but this Ming Dynasty official's robe isn't that of a Nine Minister; instead, it's the attire of a low-ranking official.\"\n\nThe man heard this and said proudly, \"This official served in two dynasties: an Imperial Censor in the former dynasty, and one of the Nine Ministers in the latter. I benefited the common people, and my official reputation was outstanding.\n\nAs for what clothes this official wears, what right do you have to comment?\"\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, typed in \"nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year,\" looked it up, and then smiled:\n\n\"That judge was not wrong. You indeed should have died on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! This official certainly did not die on that day. This official ultimately died a natural death in old age and was granted an honorable posthumous title!\" The man said dismissively.\n\n\"You should have died that day, really,\" Zhou Ze repeated, then a mocking smile appeared on his face. \"But you shamelessly refused to die.\"\n\n\"Wild talk and absurdities!\" The man waved his sleeve. \"What nonsense!\"\n\n\"Think again about what day the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year truly was, and whether you should have died!\"\n\nZhou Ze emphasized his tone, reprimanding him.\n\nThe man frowned slightly, seemingly pondering and recalling.\n\nFinally,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nHis body trembled, and an expression of shock appeared on his face.\n\nThen he glanced at the Confucius Temple behind him.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nHe finally understood why, after his death, when his soul returned to his hometown, he was confined within this Confucius Temple, living in a daze for several centuries alongside those he called imperial examination failures!\n\n\"This... this... this...\"\n\nThe man slumped to the ground, utterly disheartened.\n\nThe nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year,\n\nThis day was precisely when the Ming Dynasty fell, when Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill, and when hundreds of Ming officials accompanied their monarch to their demise.\n___\n¹ A literal translation of 衣冠禽獸 (yīguān qínshòu), meaning a person who acts like a beast while looking respectable.\n² A literal translation of 林子大了，什麼鳥也就都有了 (línzi dà le, shénme niǎo yě jiù dōu yǒu le), an idiom meaning that a large group or place will contain all sorts of people/things, both good and bad.

    "content": "The man remained silent; at this moment, he seemed somewhat lost.\n\nZhou Ze had originally thought he would turn into a fierce ghost, just like the spirits of the victims who were burned to death by the delivery guy's arson in his bookstore back then.\n\nThe existence of a ghost, once it transforms into a fierce ghost, means its obsession completely solidifies, entirely severing its path to reincarnation. The only outcome is to vanish into thin air.\n\nIt's a bit like someone taking a hundred times the overdose of a stimulant in a short period, then of course getting high as a kite; naturally, after the high, you'd better prepare for the funeral.\n\nHowever, the one before him seemed somewhat calm.\n\nVery disappointed, very lost, very helpless, and very conflicted.\n\nHe looked back at the **Confucian Temple** behind him, sighing, \"So, for someone like me, who grew up studying the sages' books, in the eyes of the sages, am I actually the same as those impoverished failures of the imperial examinations?\"\n\nHe had originally thought he was unique, that he was blessed with good fortune, and that even the **Ghost Judge** couldn't determine his fate. Who knew, in the end, it was merely his own high self-regard.\n\nActually, he should have figured it out long ago; otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to be detained here for hundreds of years, living in a daze all day, unable even to possess self-awareness, only able to circle the Confucian Temple with generations of night watchmen.\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze: \"Do you think I deserve to die?\"\n\nZhou Ze did not answer.\n\n\"I had a close friend, surnamed Liu. After learning that the late emperor committed suicide by hanging himself on **Coal Hill**^1, he led his entire family, young and old, to commit suicide in their residence, following the late emperor.\"\n\nThe man narrated softly,\n\n\"The day before it happened, he had a granddaughter, only thirteen years old, who secretly ran to my manor to seek my protection. Her mother was a concubine and wanted to ask for a chance for her to live.\n\nThen my old friend personally came to my door and took his granddaughter away.\n\nFinally, the entire Liu family, over twenty people, all hanged themselves to die for the nation. That little granddaughter, however, was stabbed to death with a precious sword. She didn't want to die, but in the end, she still died.\"\n\nThe man smiled, \"Do you think doing that was right?\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze did not remain silent. Instead, he said, \"She shouldn't have died.\"\n\n\"Yes, she shouldn't have died. So I believe that whether to live or die, everyone has their own calculation in their heart. I knew my relatives didn't want to die, and my children didn't want to die either. Therefore, I had to grit my teeth and live, to survive.\n\nI didn't just live for myself; I had to live for their entire big family.\n\nFurthermore, during my tenure in the subsequent dynasty, I saved countless lives and greatly reduced bloodshed.\n\nJust like after **Li Shimin's Xuanwu Gate Incident**^2, he knew he was destined to leave an indelible stain on history, so he exerted himself to the utmost to be an enlightened and good emperor.\n\nAt that time, I also had this mindset.\n\nI always felt that by doing more good deeds and saving more lives, even if I couldn't die for the nation, I at least kept my useful body to do things beneficial to the country and its people, which could also be considered making up for my mistakes from another perspective.\"\n\nThe man said a lot; clearly, he was unconvinced.\n\nAncient scholars called themselves disciples of the sages, because they read the sages' books and learned the sages' principles. But now, it was clear that the various figures in the Confucian Temple had deemed him an unfilial disciple.\n\nHe was originally from a **nine-ministers noble family**^3, yet his treatment after death was the same as those who failed the imperial examinations and committed suicide in the Confucian Temple.\n\nThis already indicated the sages' attitude.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down, looking at the man before him. After thinking for a moment, he still said, \"What you just said sounds a bit familiar to me. Less than a hundred years ago, someone said something similar to you.\n\nHis name was **Wang Jixin**^4.\n\nDuring a time of national peril, he became a **traitor**^5, acting as a tiger's accomplice, under the grandiose name of 'saving the nation through a circuitous path.'\"\n\nThe man slightly opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but didn't know where to begin.\n\n\"You went from being an Imperial Censor in the previous dynasty to a Nine Minister in the subsequent dynasty. You don't need to make excuses for yourself anymore.\n\nThe most essential reason is actually very simple:\n\n'The water is too cold.'^6\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the man's face showed a mix of shame and anger, and he glared furiously at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze spread his hand, his fingernails growing longer. Then, he drew out the mark on his right palm, drawing a circle, and the **Gate of Hell** opened.\n\n\"Please, isn't what you want a dignified exit? Walk in yourself.\n\nIf I have to personally seize you, then even the last bit of dignity will be gone.\"\n\nThe man stood up and walked forward step by step. Before stepping into that gate, he cast one last look at Zhou Ze, his gaze slightly profound:\n\n\"Do you think the water is cold or not?\"\n\n\"As long as you have a clear conscience.\"\n\nThe man showed a thoughtful expression, then shook his head, unsure if he had finally understood or not, but in the end, he took that step and walked into the gate.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, the gate vanished, and everything here concluded.\n\nIt seemed Zhou Ze also had to thank that official, who had swallowed all the nearby scholar ghosts, saving Zhou Ze a lot of trouble.\n\n\"Boss, is it over already?\" the female corpse said with great disappointment. \"I thought you would beat him up.\"\n\n\"Whether to beat him or not, it's meaningless,\" Zhou Ze said, casting a deep glance at the Confucian Temple not far ahead. \"Besides, the sages in the Confucian Temple have already detained him here for hundreds of years. The punishment that was due has been given.\"\n\nBai Yingying pouted, \"It seems these clay idols in the Confucian Temple are somewhat useful after all; they're not all blind.\"\n\n\"Yes, they detained the soul of that former dynasty's Imperial Censor here because they believed this censor was not their disciple, that he had done something shameless and disgraced them, and thus needed punishment.\n\nThey punished him,\n\nAnd then, the dynasty changed; the Ming Dynasty became the Qing Dynasty. Many things changed, but the Confucian Temple remained the Confucian Temple. These old gentlemen, the clay idols of the sages, still enjoyed the incense offerings of the new dynasty.\"\n\n\"............\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Boss, your words are getting more philosophical now. Are those clay idols in the temple good things or bad things?\"\n\nBai Yingying still remembered that last time she helped someone get the first incense stick into the Confucian Temple, she felt an uncomfortable sensation of being \"watched\".\n\n\"They're just... things.\"\n\nAfter taking a taxi, it was already ten o'clock at night when they returned to the bookstore. However, this was usually Zhou Ze's real business hour.\n\nProbably because there were fewer ghosts during the day and ghosts were more active at night.\n\nThese days, he had earned a bit of **Underworld currency**^7, but after the last video was given out, Zhou Ze burned a lot of it again to avoid trouble.\n\nThat video, of course, couldn't serve as direct evidence, but as long as the relevant parties knew the truth of the matter in their hearts and put in some effort to investigate thoroughly, the truth wouldn't be hard to uncover.\n\nThat video was merely a lead; it couldn't be used as real evidence.\n\nZhou Ze didn't read; instead, he wore headphones, listening to music and casually flipping through some news. Bai Yingying, meanwhile, sat behind Zhou Ze, playing games on her phone.\n\nThe master and servant, each enjoying their own leisure. In the eyes of the man next door, who was even more beautiful than a woman, this was a sign of degeneracy!\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open late at night, and a girl walked in, leading a Corgi dog.\n\nA familiar girl, a familiar Corgi.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and poured her a glass of water. As the first VIP customer, she naturally deserved this kind of service.\n\nZhou Ze also moved closer to take a look:\n\nThe person was alive,\n\nThe dog was also alive.\n\nIndeed, it was late at night, and the probability of a living person entering his bookstore was quite low.\n\n\"Boss, my dog has been found!\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe Corgi excitedly circled Zhou Ze twice, then playfully ran over to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying was playing **Honor of Kings**^8 when she was abruptly disturbed by the dog. She immediately glared at it, and the Corgi was instantly terrified.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"a dog's eyes look down on people,\"^9 but in reality, dogs can see things that people cannot.\n\nImmediately, the dog slumped to the ground, its bowels and bladder emptying all at once.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Boss, I'm so sorry.\" The girl immediately stood up, ready to clean.\n\n\"It's fine,\" Zhou Ze motioned for the girl to calm down, then told Bai Yingying, \"Clean it up.\"\n\nBai Yingying put down her phone and went to the restroom with a resentful expression to get the mop and rag.\n\n\"Boss, your bookstore's business hasn't been very good, has it?\" The girl pulled her dog back to her feet, not allowing it to run around anymore.\n\nOf course, the creature didn't dare to run around anymore, not even daring to breathe loudly.\n\n\"Just getting by,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Last time, thanks to you telling me the dog's location, I was able to find the person who took it and pay money to get it back.\"\n\n\"How much did you spend?\"\n\n\"Over ten thousand, I guess. They wouldn't return it, saying she was raising it, but after we agreed on a price, they still gave the dog back to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Boss, I think your bookstore could add some things. For example, these chairs aren't comfortable to sit on; you could change them to sofas.\"\n\nIf I had money, I'd want to change them too.\n\n\"How about I invest in shares? You can spruce this place up properly,\" the girl said to Zhou Ze, stroking her dog's head.\n\nZhou Ze knew she merely wanted to repay him, so she wouldn't mind even taking a loss to play around, but Zhou Ze couldn't agree.\n\nHe couldn't very well ask her, \"Do you mind receiving dividends in Underworld currency?\n\nUnderworld currency that can accumulate yin virtue when burned, you know?\"\n\nBack then, when that Taoist priest said this to him, Zhou Ze considered the other party an idiot,\n\nHmm,\n\nSo Zhou Ze didn't want the girl in front of him to also think he was an idiot.\n\nJust then, a \"loud laugh\" came from the noodle shop next door. Immediately after, Xu Qinglang, wearing pajamas and striking a seductive pose, ran out, came to the bookstore next door, and shouted at Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying, who was wiping dog poop:\n\n\"I won! The lottery won! One hundred thousand!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was very happy. When people are happy, they always want to share. The only place he could find living people nearby was the bookstore next door.\n\nHowever, it seemed the two in the bookstore next door weren't living people either...\n\n\"Congratulations, congratulations,\" Zhou Ze offered his congratulations.\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, get me a bag, Boss Xu,\" Bai Yingying seized the opportunity to get some lucky money.\n\n\"It's just a trifle, a trifle,\" Xu Qinglang began to act reserved. Then, seeing a young and beautiful girl next to them, he immediately became even more reserved and said:\n\n\"It's only a hundred thousand yuan, and after tax, it's just eighty thousand. It's just a small prize sum. For someone like me, who has over twenty relocation apartments in **Shiqiao District**^10, it's just small change; it won't really affect my life.\"\n\n\"Shiqiao District?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nShiqiao District was located near the city center, and property prices there were higher than in other places, so naturally, he could boast more, oh no, he could be more understated.\n\n\"Oh, that must be my family's residential complex.\"\n\n\"Your family lives there too?\" Xu Qinglang's smile grew even brighter. \"Next time, perhaps we could go out for coffee together?\"\n\n\"My family doesn't live there.\"\n\n\"Then what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, the company that demolished your home and provided your relocation apartments and compensation is probably my family's company.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n___\n1.  **Coal Hill (煤山 Méishān):** Refers to Meishan (also known as Jingshan), a hill in Beijing, where the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Chongzhen, committed suicide by hanging in 1644, marking the end of the dynasty.\n2.  **Li Shimin's Xuanwu Gate Incident (李世民宣武門 Lǐ Shìmín Xuānwǔ Mén):** Refers to the Xuanwu Gate Incident in 626 CE, where Li Shimin, later Emperor Taizong of Tang, ambushed and killed his elder brother and younger brother to secure his position as heir apparent.\n3.  **Nine-ministers noble family (九卿公族 jiǔqīng gōngzú):** The Nine Ministers were high officials in ancient China.

    "content": "This was perhaps the deepest injury Xu Qinglang had ever sustained;\n\nMen liked to show off in front of the opposite sex, to brag and flaunt, just like a gorilla pounding its chest repeatedly while courting, constantly letting out:\n\n\"Ooh ooh ooooh ooooh!\"\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, Xu Qinglang, with his fawning expression, seemed to be attempting to release that kind of mating signal for the first time.\n\nIt was a pity, however, that the girl's words: \"Your house is resettlement housing provided by my company.\"\n\n\"*Splat*!\"\n\nIt was as if something had shattered.\n\nXu Qinglang wished he could kneel down, clutching his chest with one hand.\n\nIt hurt,\n\nIt hurt so much,\n\nA pain that pierced the heart.\n\nThe girl slowly stood up and said to Zhou Ze, \"Boss, let's add each other on WeChat. If you plan to collaborate in the future, you can contact me.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Zhou Ze naturally wouldn't refuse.\n\nAfter adding WeChat, the girl led her Corgi away.\n\nXu Qinglang let out a long breath, waved his hand, slowly turned, and left the bookstore.\n\nHe needed some time to recover from his wounds.\n\nA smile played on Zhou Ze's lips. It seemed that, at least for a while, the phrase \"twenty-some houses\" wouldn't be appearing on Xu Qinglang's lips anymore.\n\nTurning his head, Zhou Ze saw Bai Yingying sitting on a plastic stool, daydreaming—no, not daydreaming. To be precise, she was holding and reading a copy of *Those Things of the Ming Dynasty*.\n\n\"Boss, what did you mean by 'the water's too cold' when you spoke to that ghost?\"\n\nA large part of the female corpse's memories were inherited from Madame Bai. In that era, the types of books women read were actually limited; naturally, it was impossible for them to be as vastly learned as men who studied for imperial examinations.\n\nAs for the gatherings of talented women in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, they could probably only exist in books.\n\n\"He was a leader in the literary circles of the late Ming Dynasty, and he also served as Minister of Rites. When the Qing troops entered the passes and the Great Ming was about to fall, he prepared to die for the country. His beloved concubine, Liu Rushi, was ready to die with him. But in the end, after his concubine jumped, he still didn't dare to jump, saying: 'The water's too cold.' He eventually surrendered to the Manchus.\"\n\n\"Then that person was really a scoundrel, wasn't he, Boss? Were you using that to mock that ghost?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"Actually, although Qian Qianyi eventually surrendered to the Qing, he secretly funded anti-Qing forces and relayed information to anti-Qing armies. He was even prosecuted by the Qing court for it.\"\n\n\"This...\" Bai Yingying didn't know how to evaluate this person.\n\nShe was very simple-minded, just like old people and children watching TV who like to ask directly: \"Is this person good, or is this person bad?\"\n\nFor many people, the world is either black or white. As for the gray areas, they're too complex, too difficult to understand, so they simply pretend not to see them.\n\n\"The one I just threw into hell is actually quite similar to Qian Qianyi in essence.\" Zhou Ze smiled, picked up his teacup, and sat down on the chair behind the counter.\n\n\"Then why did you still send him to hell?\" Bai Yingying asked, somewhat confused. \"At least, couldn't you have turned a blind eye and let him stay in the human world a bit longer?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Are you starting to pity him?\"\n\n\"The water's too cold, that's just human nature,\" Bai Yingying pouted. \"I'm dead now, a zombie. But if I were still alive, I think not dying with the monarch and the court should also be one's own choice.\n\nDying, of course, can earn praise; not dying, can also be understood.\"\n\n\"The Ghost Judge was right to say he should have died that day.\" Zhou Ze put down his teacup. \"I was dead myself, and I returned by possessing a corpse. I'm actually just struggling to survive. I shouldn't have the right to question whether others should die.\n\nDon't you think so too?\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded.\n\n\"Everything needs to be considered within a specific context. To think about ancient people and their ways of behaving, you must put yourself in that era, considering its culture, customs, and other backgrounds.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, of course, ethnic harmony means the Chinese nation is one big family.\n\nBut if you place it in the late Ming Dynasty, everyone should have their own stance.\n\nYour thinking is like an ancient peasant believing the emperor could eat ten fried dough sticks and ten large steamed meat buns for breakfast every day. It's inherently wrong and inappropriate for us to project our own small-minded thoughts onto historical figures.\n\nYes, Qian Qianyi did many things to help the anti-Qing forces even after surrendering to the Qing, and he even satirized the Qing Dynasty in the documents he compiled. But for him, that was simply not enough.\"\n\n\"Not enough? Does he really have to die?\" Bai Yingying asked, puzzled.\n\n\"He has to die.\" Zhou Ze replied very seriously. \"Including that ghost I just sent down, he also has to die!\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze took a deep breath,\n\n\"Or he could not die. He could leave freely, become a wealthy old man, completely disappear from public life, abandon glory and riches, and become utterly obscure from then on. That would also be acceptable.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Bai Yingying clearly disagreed. \"Everyone's life should be in their own hands.\"\n\n\"When Dodo's army marched into Nanjing City, Qian Qianyi was the highest-ranking official in Nanjing at the time. He led the masses in kneeling to welcome the Qing army into the city and surrendered to the Manchus.\n\nHe couldn't surrender, and he wasn't qualified to surrender.\n\nHis reputation, his identity, his authority, his status, his enjoyment, his preferential treatment—all were given to him by the imperial court, or by the state.\n\nThe more benefits you received, the more responsibility you were naturally obligated to bear.\n\nYou took so much from the state, holding the highest official positions. Even if your waist could barely move, you still pursued Liu Rushi, free to indulge in a youthful romance.*\n\nSo when the state needed him, he naturally had the obligation and responsibility to fulfill his duties.\n\nThis is a kind of, contractual spirit.\n\n'When the state is in peril, every common man has a responsibility,'** but in reality, even if an ordinary commoner simply looked up,\n\ntowards the sky,\n\nno one would fault them.\n\nBut those ancient officials who received salaries and enjoyed the people's hard-earned wealth, they inherently had the duty, when the ship of state was about to sink, to spare no effort to prop it up, or even to go down with the ship itself.\n\nIt's hard to be a hero; it's easy to be a scoundrel. We should applaud and praise heroes, rather than identifying with scoundrels and seeking excuses for them.\n\nIt's not 'I can't be a hero, so being a scoundrel is understandable.' That's never the case.\"\n\nBai Yingying listened, nodding as if she understood, yet didn't quite.\n\n\"For example, that person from the Confucian Temple, he was an imperial censor in the Ming Dynasty, similar to a prosecutor today, not even a chief prosecutor. But later, he became one of the Nine Ministers, similar to a modern-day minister.\n\nAfter surrendering, he still managed to do so well, rising steadily. You tell me, should he have died?\n\nThere was a high-ranking official in the Ming Dynasty who once cried out: 'The state has nurtured scholars for one hundred and fifty years; today is the day to uphold righteousness and die for the cause.' That's the principle I'm talking about.\"\n\n\"My head's spinning.\" Bai Yingying shook her head.\n\n\"This is a bookstore. Although there are more novels, you can also read other books.\" Zhou Ze twisted his neck. \"Anyway, you don't have anything else to do.\"\n\nBai Yingying glanced at Zhou Ze, implying that he spoke as if he himself had anything to do.\n\nZhou Ze got up, went to the restroom to wash his face, and when he came out, he saw Bai Yingying refilling his teacup. Bai Yingying asked again:\n\n\"By the way, Boss, what happened to that high-ranking official who cried out 'The state has nurtured scholars for one hundred and fifty years'?\"\n\n\"Oh, the emperor had him severely beaten with sticks by the Imperial Guards in front of Zuoshun Gate.\"\n\nZhou Ze sniffed,\n\n\"And then there was no 'then'.\"\n\n\"............\" Bai Yingying.\n\nThe master and servant rarely indulged in such intellectual conversation, discussing history and worldviews;\n\nOf course, this good atmosphere didn't last long, because the female corpse immediately put down her book and picked up her phone to play *Honor of the Dead*.\n\nHowever, another customer arrived. It was a middle-aged man, probably in his forties, wearing a black down jacket. His face was a bit rough, and his clothes were somewhat worn, making him appear rather simple and honest.\n\n\"Boss, can I put up a notice here?\" the man asked Zhou Ze humbly.\n\n\"What kind of notice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A missing person notice,\" the man replied honestly.\n\n\"Go ahead and post it.\" Zhou Ze got up, walked to the doorway, and watched as the other person put up the notice on the wall.\n\n\"No photo?\" Zhou Ze noticed the notice only had text, no picture.\n\n\"She was very young when she was taken away, only a few months old, so there's no photo,\" the man rubbed his hands together and offered Zhou Ze a cigarette. \"Don't mind it.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette and asked, \"Kidnapped?\"\n\n\"No, she was given up for adoption. At that time, she already had an older sister, and back then, there was no allowance for a second child, you see. I couldn't afford the fine, and I was afraid of losing my job, so I had no choice but to give her away to be adopted by someone else.\n\nFor all these years, we've thought of her day and night, hoping to see her again. But we haven't had much contact over the years. After all, she was given to another family to raise, and as long as they treated her well, we didn't feel it was right to disturb her; it wouldn't have been good for her.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This time, her younger brother has had bad luck and contracted leukemia. I only know that the family who adopted her lived somewhere around here more than ten years ago, so I can only search in this area.\n\nThe child's eldest sister wasn't a match, so now her younger brother's life can only be saved by her. And it's also a chance for our family to reunite.\"\n\n\"Younger brother?\" Zhou Ze frowned and asked, \"How old is she this year?\"\n\n\"Seventeen.\"\n\n\"How old is her younger brother?\"\n\n\"Sixteen.\"\n\n\"Pitiful.\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. How could such a good, young child get this disease? Boss, please keep an eye out for me. I'm going to continue posting notices further ahead. I've already contacted the media, and there might be an interview tomorrow.\n\nI expect we'll find her soon. Then our family can reunite, and her younger brother can be saved.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man smiled, very simple and honest,\n\nand then walked away.\n\nAfter he had walked far away and his figure disappeared into the night,\n\nZhou Ze looked at the missing person notice on the wall by the shop entrance and said softly:\n\n\"Pitiful.\"\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze reached out,\n\nand directly tore down the notice that had just been put up.\n\n---\n*   A classical literary allusion (`一樹梨花壓海棠`) from the Song Dynasty, often used to describe an older man with a much younger wife or concubine.\n** `國家有難，匹夫有責` (guó jiā yǒu nàn, pǐ fū yǒu zé): A Chinese idiom meaning \"When the state is in peril, every common man has a responsibility.\"",

    "content": "The second daughter is seventeen this year, and the youngest son is sixteen.\n\nThat is to say, immediately after giving away his second daughter, that simple-hearted middle-aged man, filled with overwhelming guilt and longing, had another child with his wife.\n\nSo, everything he said earlier about violating birth limits and fines was fake.\n\nHe just wanted a son. His first child was a daughter, his second was also a daughter, so he simply gave her away, and then non-stop, he worked on creating new life.\n\nEven after giving her away, he didn't even know her address or have any contact information, clearly meaning he wouldn't bother with her later.\n\nFortunately, the next child was a son; otherwise, he would have given away a third daughter, a fourth daughter...\n\nNow, because their son has leukemia and needs a match, and their eldest daughter failed to match, they finally thought:\n\nOh, we seem to have a girl we gave away.\n\nThen, to save their son, they began to search.\n\nThey mobilized the media and posted missing person flyers.\n\nIf you want to move others, first move yourself. Humans are such emotional and complex beings.\n\nIn the more than ten years since their daughter was given away, they might have felt some guilt, but they didn't regret it. If they had regretted it, they would have started searching long ago, and it would certainly have been easier to find her in the first few years after she was given away than now, more than a decade later.\n\nIf you do something wrong that causes you pain, then in the days that follow, you will constantly self-suggest to alleviate or even erase that pain.\n\nThat middle-aged man succeeded greatly. He concocted many reasons; he told the lie a hundred times, and he himself believed it.\n\nHe felt that he still loved and cared for his second daughter. He felt that giving her away back then was out of helplessness, out of necessity, a heaven-moving, unavoidable act, just like \"The Orphan of Zhao\"¹.\n\nThey wouldn't consider that the daughter they gave away is now seventeen years old;\n\nShe should be in high school, with her own social circle and a life indistinguishable from her peers;\n\nHer adoptive parents might not even have told her she was adopted, and she probably believes her adoptive parents are her biological parents.\n\nHer life should be very peaceful,\n\nBut soon, she will face a bolt from the blue!\n\nChild, let me tell you something happy: your biological parents have been found!\n\nChild, let me tell you something exciting: your previous parents aren't your biological mom and dad!\n\nChild, let me tell you something joyous: you have an older sister and a younger brother!\n\nChild, let me tell you something great: you can save your sick younger brother!\n\nSurprised?\n\nDelighted?\n\nMoved?\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong?\" Bai Yingying asked, watching Zhou Ze stand dazed in the doorway.\n\n\"There's something that makes my skin crawl every time I think of it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Do you have to be so dramatic, Boss? You've even been to hell; what could possibly scare you like this?\" Bai Yingying asked, looking at Zhou Ze curiously.\n\n\"That is, many jobs, many industries, many positions require certification and passing exams, just like getting a driver's license. You have to be confirmed as skilled, familiar with traffic laws, and then you have to drive on the road to see if you can withstand the test.\n\nOtherwise, letting someone with unqualified driving skills and mentality get a driver's license is actually irresponsible towards other pedestrians and drivers on the road.\"\n\n\"And then?\" Bai Yingying pressed.\n\n\"But to be a parent, no certification is required.\"\n\n...............\n\nThe night passed without a word. When Zhou Ze woke up the next morning, he initially went to eat next door as usual, but the door was closed.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a little worried that Xu Qinglang might have been too devastated last night, perhaps becoming completely disheartened?\n\nHe didn't care if Xu Qinglang was disheartened, but Zhou Ze couldn't do without his concoctions.\n\nHe called, and Xu Qinglang quickly answered. It turned out he had gone to collect his lottery winnings and said he'd buy everyone a small gift later as a gesture.\n\nThere was nothing for it; Zhou Ze could only order takeout and gobble it down with the plum juice he still had at home.\n\nThe shop door was still closed. Though unlocked, it clearly showed an attitude of being too lazy to do business, but Zhou Ze had long since grown content with the situation.\n\nHowever, when he sat back down in the chair behind the counter and opened the drawer, Zhou Ze was surprised to find a thick stack of hell money inside.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze thought Bai Yingying had deliberately bought some hell money to give him a surprise, but then he thought Bai Yingying wouldn't be that childish.\n\nHe took the hell money in his hand and flicked it; it was real.\n\nRather amusing, isn't it...?\n\nNowadays, with the convenience of mobile payments, it's increasingly rare to see people in shops or wet markets flicking large banknotes in the sunlight to check for authenticity.\n\nBut this was real currency.\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment. It must be his commission from escorting that Imperial Censor down yesterday. That official later rose to the rank of Nine Ministers in the Qing Dynasty; he had a large family and a vast fortune, so naturally his descendants offered plenty of filial piety and tributes.\n\nZhou Ze estimated that if this hell money were burned, someone would likely lose several wallets outside his door, probably at least five thousand yuan worth.\n\nThis wave seems worth it; he earned over five thousand in half a night, and the only cost he could recall was less than a hundred yuan for round-trip taxi fare.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to go burn the joss paper money now. This hell money was useful at critical moments; it could help ward off minor misfortunes and prevent troublesome interferences, sometimes more effective than several thousand RMB.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe person wasn't even inside yet, but the voice had already called out.\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw his sister-in-law walk in.\n\n\"Here, for you.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law was carrying a shoulder bag today. She took out a stack of money from it and placed it on Zhou Ze's counter.\n\n\"Returning your money.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"You could have just transferred it via phone.\"\n\n\"No way, handing over a stack of cash feels more satisfying,\" his sister-in-law pouted.\n\nAfter the last incident, his sister-in-law's impression of Zhou Ze had improved. Of course, it was also because the old Xu Le was too much of a coward to even control his own wife, so his sister-in-law naturally looked down on him even more.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze was somewhat stern with her, putting on the air of an elder, and she actually took him seriously.\n\n\"Xu Le, your business is really bad, you know,\" his sister-in-law said, hands in her pockets.\n\n\"No class today?\"\n\n\"It's the weekend,\" his sister-in-law said, pouting discontentedly. \"But I'm going to a bar later. I told my sister I was coming here to read and do homework, so don't you dare spill the beans.\"\n\nYour sister hasn't contacted me in half a month.\n\nZhou Ze felt a little wistful. He had thought Lin's spontaneous hug after his confession was a good start, but perhaps it was just Lin's courage in that moment.\n\nBut once a person calms down, their thoughts tend to multiply, and Lin might not have yet found her way out of that strange loop and dilemma.\n\nHer lawful husband, whom she didn't love, had died,\n\nAnd then the man she loved was reincarnated into her lawful husband's body,\n\nA seemingly universally happy outcome,\n\nYet with an unbridgeable moral chasm.\n\nFortunately, after the incident with the Faceless Woman last time, Zhou Ze was no longer in a rush concerning this matter.\n\nAt least the thought \"she won't sleep with me anyway\" hadn't appeared in his mind for a long time.\n\nPerhaps it was also because Bai Yingying had been sleeping beside him every night recently,\n\nAlthough Bai Yingying could only be looked at, not used,\n\nBut being able to look was also good.\n\n\"Go to places like bars less often,\" Zhou Ze reminded her. \"It's not too late to relax and do what you like after you get into college.\"\n\n\"Alright, you're just like my parents and my sister. You're a college student yourself, so how did you end up like this?\"\n\nHis sister-in-law's way of speaking,\n\nTo put it positively, she was straightforward;\n\nTo put it negatively, she was dense.\n\nZhou Ze believed that the reason Xu Le, that coward, had originally decided to spend money to hire someone to kill him was certainly aided by his sister-in-law constantly provoking him and increasing his \"rage points\" on the side.\n\nIt seemed his sister-in-law didn't know about that female classmate, perhaps due to considerations for protecting minors.\n\n\"I'm back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang returned, carrying a pile of things.\n\n\"I'm exhausted. Today's just weird; I couldn't get a single taxi. I don't know if my luck's just terrible today or if all the taxi drivers went to their annual meeting.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put down the things and then wiped his sweat.\n\nBai Yingying walked over then, her eyes lighting up at the sight of the items on the floor.\n\nThese were computer components.\n\n\"I'll install it in my shop. Come play whenever you want,\" Xu Qinglang said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nImmediately, Xu Qinglang took out a bag for Bai Yingying and tossed Zhou Ze a delicate lighter.\n\n\"Here, sharing the love equally!\"\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\nHis sister-in-law wasn't interested in these gifts; she was interested in the plastic fan still stuck behind Xu Qinglang's neck.\n\nWinter wasn't over yet, and he was carrying a fan. Interesting.\n\n\"A group of people were holding an event when I walked past the mall, and they forced it on me,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nHis sister-in-law took the fan in her hand. It was a very ordinary plastic fan, with \"GG\" printed on it. After seeing it, his sister-in-law couldn't help but let out a chuckle.\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"'Where Are We Going, Dad?' is printed on it,\" his sister-in-law replied.\n\n\"What's so funny about that? You have such a low bar for humor?\" Xu Qinglang reached for the fan, then his eyes widened.\n\n\"Perfect, you and my brother-in-law can go together.\" His sister-in-law swept a mischievous glance over Xu Qinglang and Zhou Ze.\n\n\"The 'GG' from 'Where Are We Going, Dad?'\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression was somewhat unreadable, but he still tossed the fan to Zhou Ze. \"See for yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the fan and glanced at it,\n\nOnly to see a hospital building in the background,\n\nAt the very top, in large letters: \"Where Are We Going, Dad?\"\n\nAnd below that, two lines of cartoon text:\n\n\"Take your son for a circumcision!\n\nSecond one half price!\"\n***\n¹\"The Orphan of Zhao\" is a classical Chinese play about a loyal minister who sacrifices his own child to save the last heir of a betrayed family, implying a noble and tragic sacrifice.",

    "content": "\"You know, today is really strange, alas, the taxis are truly nowhere to be seen.\"\n\nThrowing down the fan, Xu Qinglang re-stacked these items, preparing to go home to assemble the computer.\n\n\"Bad luck, huh?\" Zhou Ze didn't take it seriously, instead walking outside the shop door to light a cigarette.\n\nThe midday sun was still quite pleasant.\n\nBai Yingying didn't like sunbathing, which might be related to her identity and nature, but she wouldn't directly turn to ash upon contact with sunlight like the zombies in old Hong Kong films.\n\nAccording to Xu Qinglang, under the two hundred years of Madam Bai's soul's nourishment, Bai Yingying was no longer ordinary; although not as terrifying as a great weapon like a drought demon, she was no longer a low-level little zombie.\n\nThis was indeed the case; if Bai Yingying wished, she could completely change her appearance and integrate into urban life with a different identity.\n\nBut her soul blood was clutched in his hand, so she couldn't leave. Moreover, she seemed unwilling to leave; perhaps one day a lightning strike would kill her, after all, she wasn't favored by Heaven.\n\n\"Smoke less. You're smoking too much now.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law also walked out of the shop door, looking as if she was planning to go out and have fun.\n\nZhou Ze ignored her.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze quite envied her; she had grown up in a honey pot* since childhood, innocently sweet and kind, but that was also a kind of happiness.\n\nUnlike himself, a child raised in an orphanage, always possessing an innate sense of insecurity. Anyone who wanted to get ahead would spare no effort to do so.\n\nLike his childhood friend Wang Ke, who strove so hard day and night that he didn't even know when his wife went out to get her hair done.\n\nHumans,\n\nIt seemed just as he thought it, because a red sedan quickly drove onto the road in front of Zhou Ze's shop door.\n\nOut came familiar faces: Wang Ke's wife, and that little loli.\n\n\"Hello, older sister. Hello, uncle.\"\n\nThe little loli very obediently greeted them.\n\nThe sister-in-law couldn't help but squat down and reach out to pinch the little loli's cheek, saying, \"This little doll is so cute.\"\n\nThe woman smiled at Zhou Ze and said, \"I'm going to get my hair done; she can read a book here with you for a while.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze assented.\n\nAfter thanking him, the woman turned and got back into the car and drove off, her movements very quick, showing a kind of impatience.\n\nThe sister-in-law also hailed a taxi and left, reminding Zhou Ze again to cover for her before she went.\n\nAt the shop entrance, the little loli stood beside Zhou Ze, who was squatting there smoking.\n\n\"You haven't returned, have you?\" Zhou Ze suddenly spoke.\n\n\"Uncle, what are you saying?\" The little loli was somewhat perplexed, innocently cute.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the little loli's head.\n\n\"Come on, let's go read.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked out a copy of \"Guwen Guanzhi\" for the little loli and handed it to her, then asked, \"How are your grades at school?\"\n\n\"My grades are really good,\" the little loli said proudly.\n\n\"Do you have any hobbies?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I can dance ballet, and I'm also learning to play the piano,\" the little loli replied.\n\n\"What would you like to drink?\"\n\n\"I want to drink cola.\" After speaking, the little loli stuck out her tongue. \"Mom usually doesn't let me drink it.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, went to Xu Qinglang's next door, and brought back a can of cola.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nThe little loli took the cola and sweetly said:\n\n\"Thank you, Uncle.\"\n\nAfter a sip of cola, the little loli turned a page and began to read with great interest.\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\nZhou Ze, holding a cup of water, suddenly spoke.\n\nThe innocent cuteness on the little loli's face gradually faded, replaced by a deep look similar to an adult's.\n\nRaising the book in her hand,\n\n\"When I realized I shouldn't be reading this book, I found it was already too late.\"\n\nThe book the little loli held was the \"Guwen Guanzhi\" Zhou Ze had given her earlier, and it was neither in vernacular Chinese nor a youth edition.\n\n\"Why did you come looking for me?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHas that one in Rongcheng been dealt with?\n\nSo, she's back?\n\n\"I just came back from Hell. I missed you, so I came to see you.\" The little loli stood up, tilted her head slightly, looked at Zhou Ze, and smiled: \"I've noticed you're quite lazy, and very slacking off.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The performance review shows that my recent performance in this large area is at the bottom.\" The little loli licked her lips. \"I told you to handle it as you saw fit before, but not to be this lazy.\"\n\n\"Performance review?\" Zhou Ze's heart stirred when he heard this.\n\n\"What, is there a problem? Did you think being a ghost messenger meant you didn't have to worry about performance?\" the little loli retorted.\n\n\"Can you... let me see it?\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask why it can't just be given directly to you?\"\n\nThe little loli moved closer to Zhou Ze. She wanted to meet his gaze, but she was too short; after moving closer, it turned into Zhou Ze looking down at her instead.\n\nThis made her very uncomfortable,\n\nImmediately, she waved her hand,\n\nAnd said angrily:\n\n\"Pick me up.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked up the little loli so that her eyes could meet his.\n\n\"Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.\" The little loli's icy fingers rubbed Zhou Ze's chin for a moment. \"Do you really want to become a full-time employee?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThere was nothing to be embarrassed about admitting.\n\n\"I can give you something to look forward to. I'll be going to Rongcheng in a while. Once I deal with that troublemaker, I might get a chance for a promotion.\n\nAt that time, my current position can be transferred to you, provided you bring my performance back up next month.\"\n\nThe little loli drew a big pie** for Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze somewhat understood; the little loli's action was a bit like someone who originally worked at a company, then assigned their tasks to another person to do for them, while they themselves went to do side jobs.\n\n\"Perhaps, I can expect another possibility,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What possibility?\"\n\n\"You die in Rongcheng, and then the position naturally becomes mine.\"\n\nDeep down, Zhou Ze didn't wish for anything to happen to that person; after all, they had helped him in his dream last time.\n\nAs for why he said it so bluntly, it was simple: there was indeed no need for too many twists and turns between them.\n\n\"Heh heh...\"\n\nThe little loli didn't get angry or upset. Instead, she voluntarily jumped down from Zhou Ze's arms, her hands clasped behind her back, and said:\n\n\"Do you think that person still has a chance? You don't know how many ghost messengers have come this time.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't be explaining this to me.\" Zhou Ze lit another cigarette, exhaled a smoke ring, and said, \"Explaining means you're afraid too.\"\n\n\"Don't put gold on his face, and don't put gold on your face***.\" The little loli turned around, her deep eyes fixed on Zhou Ze. \"Aren't you a doctor? Why would you wish for my death?\n\nAm I not cute?\"\n\n\"Oh, what a cute child, where did you come from?\"\n\nBai Yingying happened to come down from the second floor at this moment. Upon seeing the little loli, she immediately walked over happily, ready to hug the child.\n\n\"Madam Bai?\"\n\nThe little loli slightly frowned.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nEven if Bai Yingying was stupid, she would know that the person in front of her was not just some neighborhood kid.\n\n\"Oh, my old neighbor has cultivated enough merits and gone down; you are the shell she left behind.\" The little loli glared at Zhou Ze. \"You keep her by your side, no wonder fewer ghosts actively approach you!\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Bai Yingying asked somewhat timidly.\n\n\"My time is limited. This time I just came to remind you. I'm not afraid of you having other intentions; who wouldn't have other intentions?\"\n\nThe little loli walked to the bookshelf with her head held high.\n\n\"I'll be back in a month. Whether you can take over my position, I don't know. Whether I can secure a promotion, I also don't know.\n\nBut if you fail to bring my performance up next month,\n\nthere will be no need for you to remain in this mortal realm. Go back to your Hell and wait to drink Meng Po Soup****.\"\n\nAfter saying these words, the little loli tilted her head, and her entire body fainted. Immediately afterward, a black light suddenly ascended,\n\nBiu!\n\nDirectly shot underground!\n\n\"Boss, who is she? Is she a Judge of the Underworld?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"She's a ghost messenger. I'm a temporary worker; she's officially employed.\" Zhou Ze picked up the sleeping little loli, carried her to the boss's chair behind his counter, and covered her with a blanket.\n\n\"She's just a ghost messenger, yet she acts like she has more airs than a Judge of the Underworld.\"\n\n\"Have you seen a Judge of the Underworld?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What will Madam Bai's status be after she 'goes down'?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but she should be able to receive a noble title***** from Hell.\"\n\nJust then, a middle-aged man in a police uniform pushed open the bookstore door and walked in.\n\nAs soon as he entered,\n\nhe felt as if the temperature in the bookstore had risen slightly, and Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying both simultaneously felt a sense of discomfort.\n\nAs if thorns were in their backs******.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked at him. The man wore a police cap, its national emblem gleaming under the refraction of the outdoor sunlight.\n\nSquare-faced, thick-lipped, and heavily built, he was quite imposing.\n\n\"Boss, recommend some good books to read. I'm going on a business trip soon, and I'd like something to pass the time on the way,\" the police uncle said, taking off his cap and scratching his scalp.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled slightly, carefully observed the other person for a moment, and confirmed that he was not a ghost.\n\nOnly then did he turn to the bookshelf, find a few books, and hand them to him.\n\nThe police uncle reached out and took the stack of books. When he saw the first one, he was stunned for a moment: it was \"Fundamentals of Public Security.\"\n\nWhen he flipped to the second book,\n\nThe police uncle was stunned again: it was \"Law of the People's Republic of China on People's Police.\"\n\nBelow it were two more, namely: \"Theory and Practice of Dispute Resolution\" and \"Explanation of Grappling and Combat Techniques.\"\n\nThe police uncle took a deep breath, seemingly deliberating how to phrase his words, then put down the books in his hand,\n\n\"I misspoke just now. I'm taking my son on a trip, and I'm afraid he'll get bored on the way, so I want to buy him some books to pass the time. He prefers horror.\"\n\n\"Oh, understood.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out two books from a box below and handed them to the man again,\n\nThey were: \"Horror Webnovels\" and \"Horror Broadcast.\"\n\nOnly then did the police uncle nod with satisfaction:\n\n\"These are good.\"\n___\n*   Literally 'in a honey pot,' an idiom describing someone who has been pampered or raised in luxury.\n**  Literally 'drew a big pie,' an idiom meaning to offer a tempting but potentially unattainable promise or a rosy picture of the future.\n*** Literally 'don't put gold on your face,' an idiom meaning 'don't flatter yourself' or 'don't take undue credit.'\n**** In Chinese mythology, a magical soup given by Meng Po to souls before reincarnation to erase memories of their past lives.\n***** Literally 'imperial decree/title of nobility,' referring to a formal title or position bestowed by a higher authority, often implying prestige.\n****** Literally 'thorns on one's back,' an idiom describing a feeling of extreme unease, discomfort, or threat.",

    "content": "The police officer sat there reading a book, periodically checking his phone for the time.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nWith him in the store, both Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying felt immense pressure.\n\nThey felt a prickling sensation of unease.\n\nThis was a good police officer, exuding an aura of righteousness, and with him in his police uniform, he could make almost all evil spirits retreat.\n\nBut Zhou Ze had no way to retreat; after all, this was his own store.\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying were not low-level lonely ghosts, wild spirits, or mountain sprites; although they felt a bit uncomfortable, there was no substantial harm.\n\nQuite the opposite, Zhou Ze felt a genuine respect for him.\n\nIt's true that people's true thoughts are hidden,\n\nbut as ghosts, they were more sensitive to this feeling.\n\nThat's why the batch of books Zhou Ze initially gave him wasn't meant to tease him; rather, Zhou Ze had a preconceived notion that a police officer capable of cultivating such a noble spirit would likely enjoy reading serious and valuable books.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze later realized that police officers are also human;\n\nAnd as humans, they have their own interests and hobbies, just like the police officer in front of him, who was completely engrossed in his novel.\n\n\"Uncle, here's some tea.\" Bai Yingying timidly brought the teacup over.\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\" The police officer took the teacup, looked at Bai Yingying, and asked, \"Aren't you in school?\"\n\n\"Today's a holiday.\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't dare say she wasn't in school and was just drifting along, lest she cause more trouble for herself.\n\nBai Yingying was somewhat afraid of the person in front of her, even more so than Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was a contemporary person and could put himself into this mindset; while the man in front of him instinctively made him afraid, it also meant, in another sense, that he was all the more worthy of respect.\n\nAs for Bai Yingying, she just felt her heart racing; after handing over the tea, she immediately ran upstairs to the second floor, not wanting to come down again.\n\n\"Boss, how much?\" The police officer looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Whatever you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"No, that won't do. Never mind, I'll settle up when I leave. They'll probably be here to pick me up in about half an hour.\" The police officer sat back down, felt his pocket, and paused.\n\nAs a veteran smoker, Zhou Ze understood and offered him a cigarette.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nThe police officer thanked Zhou Ze for lighting his cigarette, and then the two of them smoked together.\n\nCigarettes truly were a bridge for male socializing; from strangers, they became smoking buddies, making it easier to shoot the breeze.\n\n\"Your business here, it's not very easy, is it?\" the police officer asked.\n\n\"Just muddling along,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, I remember who you are now.\" The police officer patted his head and said, \"During that fire last time, you acted heroically and rushed into the blaze to save people, didn't you?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Look at my memory. Right, the department wanted to give you an award banner last time, why didn't you go to receive it?\"\n\n\"Just doing my part, didn't want to draw attention to myself,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe police officer nodded, somewhat helplessly, and said, \"Indeed, no one expected that the arsonist would turn out to be one of the heroes who rushed into the fire to save people.\"\n\n\"Damn it, taxis have really disappeared! Ride-hailing is hard to get at this hour, and I can't even flag down a taxi. Old Zhou, it looks like we really need to move. This godforsaken place, you can't even get a cab anymore. I'm missing a cable here, and I have to go back and buy another one, otherwise I can't assemble the main unit.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked in, complaining, then saw the police officer sitting in the bookstore.\n\n\"Oh, Director Zhao!\"\n\nXu Qinglang clearly recognized the police officer, immediately smiled, and said cordially:\n\n\"Director Zhao, you look as hale and hearty as ever! Hmm, I remember seeing some news about you recently, what was it about? I forgot, but it seemed like you rendered meritorious service and received another medal. Yes, that must be it. Congratulations, congratulations!\"\n\n\"You little rascal, you've certainly grown more handsome.\" The police officer stood up with a laugh, patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder, appearing quite affectionate, and asked, \"Still up to petty thievery?\"\n\n\"How could I dare? Our family property was expropriated, and we were allocated over twenty apartments. Now I'm a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"You...\" Director Zhao pointed at Xu Qinglang. \"You've certainly seen your suffering end and good times begin.\"\n\n\"Director Zhao, your son is getting married soon, isn't he? How about I give you an apartment as a wedding home for your son?\"\n\n\"Brat, if you dare say such outrageous talk in front of me again, do you believe I won't throw you back into the station?\" Director Zhao reprimanded him sternly.\n\n\"Hey, I just run a noodle shop; it's not like I'm bribing you. If it weren't for you back then, I probably wouldn't have lasted until our old house and land were expropriated. It's only right that I show my respect by giving you an apartment.\"\n\n\"Just live your life well.\"\n\n\"You two know each other?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nDirector Zhao nodded. \"Know him? More than just know him. This kid started stealing things and pickpocketing on the streets when he wasn't even ten years old. I caught him many times. The first time I caught him, I even told my officers I'd caught a girl thief. Who knew he was actually a boy!\"\n\n\"I didn't know any better back then, so let's not bring it up.\" Xu Qinglang certainly didn't want Zhou Ze to hear about his past embarrassing incidents.\n\n\"Mention it? We must mention it! You've done a lot of misdeeds in the past, and those mistakes can't be forgotten. You must remember them and keep yourself vigilant so you don't make them again. Good times are hard-won, you know.\"\n\n\"Director Zhao, I understand.\" Xu Qinglang nodded.\n\n\"Right, I sent you to Master Sun to be an apprentice. How is Master Sun doing now?\" Director Zhao asked.\n\n\"He's doing alright, but his shop has been passed on to his son, and I've struck out on my own.\"\n\nIt turned out this was why Xu Qinglang opened a noodle shop; back then, his family experienced a misfortune, and he was almost becoming a hoodlum. Director Zhao, who was then the head of the local police station, caught and disciplined him several times. Director Zhao eventually even arranged for him to apprentice at a noodle shop, which finally set him on the right track.\n\nOtherwise, the current Xu Qinglang might have needed to add another property to his name: a jail cell.\n\n\"Director Zhao, what brings you here?\" After speaking, Xu Qinglang quietly added, \"Let me tell you, don't come to this place often; the feng shui isn't good.\"\n\nThe implication was that in Zhou Ze's bookstore, there were far more dead people than living ones who came to read.\n\nZhou Ze, standing nearby, raised an eyebrow.\n\nWhat did he mean by that?\n\n\"Brat, you still haven't changed your habit of playing mysterious antics. I was born and grew up under the Red Flag; I don't believe in any of that superstitious nonsense. Besides, a clear conscience fears no ghosts. Even if ghosts really exist in this world, it's the ghosts who should be afraid of me, not the other way around!\"\n\nZhou Ze, standing nearby, rubbed the tip of his nose. He really had it right.\n\n\"Director Zhao, I'll personally cook a few dishes and show off my skills. We haven't seen each other in years; how about we have a couple of drinks tonight?\"\n\n\"Can't do it, ah. Someone's coming to pick me up soon; I'm going on a business trip to another province. I just bought two novels specifically to read on the road so I wouldn't get bored.\"\n\n\"You're already a bureau chief, and still so busy,\" Xu Qinglang said with some regret.\n\n\"It's good to be busy. I'm a police officer; if police officers slack off, the common people won't be able to rest easy.\"\n\nDirector Zhao scratched his head, put his police cap back on, then took out his phone to check the time again and said:\n\n\"It's almost time; they should be here to pick me up. I'm going now.\"\n\n\"Take care.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself that he had finally sent off this overwhelmingly radiant figure.\n\nDirector Zhao reached the doorway, then seemed to remember something, reaching into his pocket as if to get his wallet:\n\n\"Look at my memory. I took books and drank tea, almost forgot to pay.\"\n\n\"Look at you, treating me like an outsider! I've got it covered.\" Xu Qinglang immediately stepped forward and said, \"This boss practically grew up eating my food; he's family.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"No, that won't do. Why should you pay for the books I bought?\" Director Zhao disagreed.\n\n\"Alright, in a few days I'll personally visit your home and let you return my book money, and I'll mooch a meal while I'm at it, how's that?\" Xu Qinglang pleaded, \"You have to give me a reason to visit, right?\"\n\n\"Alright then. Your auntie's cooking is quite good. I might not be home then, but I'll tell her to cook you a meal, and you should learn a thing or two. Strive to turn this noodle shop into a hotel someday. People always need some ambition. Don't just live a meaningless life lying around on those properties; that's no fun either.\"\n\n\"Heh, what would I go for if you're not home?\" Xu Qinglang laughed.\n\n\"Alright, I'm off now, goodbye!\" Director Zhao waved to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, pushed open the bookstore door, and left.\n\n\"Boss, there are so many cars outside!\" Bai Yingying, who had been upstairs, walked down the stairs and called out to the people in the bookstore.\n\n\"What kind of cars?\" Xu Qinglang asked. \"A wedding convoy, maybe?\"\n\n\"No wedding car is as impressive as an eight-bearer sedan chair,\" Zhou Ze quipped to Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Not wedding cars, they're taxis. So many taxis, the entire road is full of them,\" Bai Yingying said. She had seen clearly from the second-floor window.\n\n\"Taxis?\" Xu Qinglang paused, then said, \"Crap, I wondered why it was so hard to get a taxi today; there were none to be seen! Are they organizing a strike protest?\"\n\nSuddenly, Xu Qinglang froze.\n\nHe seemed to have remembered something, immediately took out his phone and started searching, and finally, he found it.\n\nIt was a news report from half a month ago.\n\nThe news homepage featured a large photo of Director Zhao. The content below reported that a car theft gang, which had roamed across multiple provinces, was apprehended in Tongcheng. They were discovered by an off-duty Deputy Bureau Chief who was heading home. During the struggle, the Deputy Bureau Chief unfortunately died in the line of duty.\n\nAnd three days later, the police rounded up the entire criminal gang, not missing a single member. This car theft ring mainly stole taxis and also had two taxi drivers' lives on their hands.\n\nDirector Zhao had already died.\n\n\"He's already dead... I remember reading that news and being sad for a long time. But just now, the moment I saw him in front of me, I subconsciously felt he was still alive and didn't think of that news at all.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Xu Qinglang angrily looked at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"He's a ghost, he's not alive! Why didn't you remind me just now? I had so many things left to say to him!\"\n\nZhou Ze also wore a stunned expression and said, \"He's a ghost?\"\n\n\"You didn't notice? You're a ghost emissary; how could you not notice?\"\n\n\"When he came in, I specifically observed him; he was human!\"\n\n\"How could he be human!\" Xu Qinglang nearly roared.\n\nHe could have said goodbye to him earlier, but he had just been busy with idle chatter!\n\n\"Why would I lie to you? I observed him carefully; I truly didn't realize he was a ghost.\"\n\n\"I didn't notice either,\" Bai Yingying said as she walked over.\n\nAt this moment, on the road in front of the store,\n\nTaxis, one after another, were slowly advancing in two parallel columns. The procession was extremely long, almost endless.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed open the bookstore door and walked out; Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying followed him.\n\nNearly a thousand taxis had spontaneously organized into a convoy, moving forward. The taxi drivers, having abandoned their usual habit of speeding and constantly overtaking,\n\nthis time,\n\nthey drove very, very slowly.\n\nAt the rear of the convoy,\n\nthere was a hearse, playing funeral music.\n\nAt the same time, a large black and white photo hung above the hearse: Director Zhao's posthumous portrait.\n\n\"Is today the funeral procession?\" Xu Qinglang said wistfully. \"So when he said he was going on a business trip and someone was coming to pick him up, he meant this funeral procession? But how could I not tell he was a ghost? And you couldn't either!\"\n\n\"Some people are alive, yet already dead;\n\nSome people are dead, yet still alive.\n\nPerhaps that's why,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Ah.\" Hearing this, Xu Qinglang nodded, then waved his hand at the long convoy, saying his farewells.\n\nAt the same time, he felt somewhat relieved, realizing why it had been so hard to get a taxi in Tongcheng today.\n\nZhou Ze watched as the vehicle with the posthumous portrait slowly drove past,\n\nand in his heart, he said:\n\n\"Rest in peace.\"\n\n——————\n\nThis story is adapted from a true event.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang had originally planned to hold a funeral rite for Director Zhao, hoping he could depart peacefully, and also to fulfill his own intentions.\n\nBut on second thought, Director Zhao had actually departed very peacefully; he even specifically brought two books to read on the Yellow Springs Road, fearing it would be too boring.\n\nFurthermore, the spontaneous farewell convoy organized by thousands of taxis and numerous citizens was already enough to ensure Director Zhao's peaceful journey. There was no need for him to make a superfluous addition.\n\n\"Old Zhou, he was a very good person.\"\n\nXu Qinglang smoked, his eyes slightly red at the corners, a pitiful sight to behold.\n\n\"He also departed with a clear conscience.\"\n\nEven if he was a doctor in his previous life, saving and helping many people, Zhou Ze didn't consider himself great; his profession was a doctor, and saving the dying and aiding the injured was simply his duty.\n\nIn fact, those ordinary yet great people, they only do their own work in society, but the brilliance they possess is not merely confined to their work.\n\nThere are always some things that can move you, move many people.\n\nPeople often ponder deeply: are the eyes of the masses truly discerning?\n\nBut those nearly a thousand cab drivers, who formed a team to send him off and lead the way, they were very clear in their hearts.\n\n\"I'm going to rest.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out a tissue, wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes, and turned back to his noodle restaurant. He wanted to have a drink, then get a good night's sleep. Strong people always dislike showing their vulnerable side to others.\n\nAfter finishing his cigarette, Zhou Ze also walked back to the bookstore. The little loli told him to improve his performance, but Zhou Ze was as lazy as ever.\n\nBecause he genuinely lacked some subjective initiative, and also, Zhou Ze was waiting for a result: what would be the fate of that person in Rongcheng?\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze himself felt that the other party's chances of turning the tables were slim, the little loli had personally returned to Hell, released the Faceless Woman to help, and even teamed up with many other ghost constables.\n\nBut,\n\nWhat if?\n\nWhat if?\n\nYes, what if!\n\nZhou Ze even genuinely considered and looked forward to it: if that person in Rongcheng managed to kill the little loli, wouldn't the little loli's position naturally fall to him?\n\nDreams, one must always have them.\n\nTaking out his phone, Zhou Ze dialed a number; it was Old Dao's phone.\n\nAfter he treated Old Dao to a meal last time, the two hadn't been in contact again.\n\nNo one answered on the other end, so Zhou Ze put down his phone. But soon, the other party called him back:\n\n\"Hey, big brother, I'm not in Tongcheng right now, I'm in Xucheng. What's up, anything?\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally wanted Old Dao to remind that person to be careful, but after thinking about it, he didn't waste any more breath, not even nagging excessively, and simply hung up the phone.\n\nOld Dao on the other end of the phone probably found it baffling too.\n\nIn that dream, the young man clearly knew he was being watched, so his current reminder was somewhat redundant.\n\nThat person, they're aware.\n\nStretching, the little loli woke up at this moment, returning to her cute, dazed appearance. Then her mother returned after getting her hair done and picked her up.\n\nIt could be seen that her mother's hair was done very successfully, still without much change, but she herself looked even more rosy and radiant, like dew drops sprinkled on a summer morning's flower stamen, appearing more mature and delicate.\n\nWhen getting out of the car and walking, her legs were spread even wider.\n\nToday's matters should have ended there. Zhou Ze had originally planned to take a shower, then prepare for the evening's business.\n\nThe little loli said that keeping Bai Yingying, this zombie, by his side was like adding a lampshade to himself, an incandescent light bulb, which would affect the probability of encountering ghosts. But Zhou Ze currently had no desire to send Bai Yingying away.\n\nSleeping with a freezer was, of course, not as comfortable as sleeping with Bai Yingying.\n\nMoreover, ghosts kept coming to the bookstore, and Zhou Ze was getting a bit annoyed. This was still with Bai Yingying present; if Bai Yingying wasn't there, he would genuinely have to deal with a large number of departed souls every night.\n\nZhou Ze felt he had degenerated. How ambitious and motivated he was in his previous life,\n\nwhile in this life, he just wanted to muddle through. But this lazy and aimless feeling, a life of reading books and Ge You slumping* every day,\n\nIt's truly comfortable.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze asked Bai Yingying to get his change of clothes, preparing to take a shower,\n\nSomeone pushed open the shop door. Zhou Ze turned around, slightly surprised by this person's arrival, because his daughter and wife had just left the shop.\n\n\"I've come for a follow-up, to see how you've been doing recently.\"\n\nWang Ke naturally pulled out a plastic stool and sat on it, while motioning Zhou Ze to sit opposite him.\n\nHe had his own psychiatric hospital, and his fees were also very high. So, proactively following up to help Zhou Ze for free was, in his eyes and in the eyes of outsiders, truly giving Zhou Ze a lot of face.\n\nOf course, half of this 'face' was attributed to the true Zhou Ze, and the other half was because Zhou Ze had saved his daughter back then.\n\nZhou Ze sat down opposite Wang Ke,\n\ntrying his best to lower his gaze and not look at Wang Ke's head.\n\nBecause a dense green light emanated from Wang Ke's head, as if ten thousand horses were galloping.\n\nThe bookstore's computer was connected to a small Bluetooth speaker, randomly playing some pop music. Just then, it switched to Stefanie Sun's \"Green Light.\"\n\nThese days, even random play is so mischievous.\n\n\"Tell me, how have you been feeling lately?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"I think I'm very well, the problem isn't big anymore.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"I can tell, you're very calm, and you're coping with ease.\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\nHowever, both fell silent.\n\nZhou Ze was a little strange; it seemed clear that the other party wasn't specifically coming for a follow-up on his condition; that was just a pretext.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to ask for your help with.\" Wang Ke spoke again.\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\nSetting aside their relationship in the previous life, purely based on his recent help in diagnosing him and offering advice and analysis, Zhou Ze also owed him a favor.\n\n\"I have a client who has dissociative identity disorder. Her problem is quite complex and a bit difficult to handle, so I need you to help me examine and analyze it.\"\n\n\"This shouldn't be difficult for you, should it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Difficult,\" Wang Ke said with a bitter laugh. \"Her father is an important business partner of mine; my psychiatric hospital was also established with his investment.\n\nIf it were simply a matter of helping the primary personality eliminate the secondary one, or helping the secondary personality eliminate the primary one, I would have methods and the ability to try.\n\nBut the problem's complexity lies in this:\n\nFor my partner, his daughter's primary personality is, of course, his daughter herself, but the secondary personality is very similar to his wife.\"\n\n\"So... mother and daughter are living in one body?\"\n\n\"Yes, his wife passed away last year due to illness, and he was very sad. His daughter is only sixteen this year. I've analyzed that it might be because the girl subconsciously couldn't accept the fact that her mother had passed away.\n\nSo, in her own consciousness, she gradually 're-created' an image of her mother to accompany herself.\n\nIf this problem had been discovered earlier, it would have been fine, but by the time it was truly discovered and taken seriously, it was already too late. The secondary personality had already formed, and it was very mature.\n\nDuring the day, she's the daughter; at night, she's the mother.\n\nDuring the day, she goes to school, plays computer games, and watches TV series in her room.\n\nAt night, she wants to go rest in her father's bedroom. If my friend doesn't open the door, she cries outside, saying he has other women and doesn't want to touch her anymore.\"\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\nWang Ke's expression was a bit awkward. Zhou Ze's comment made him uncomfortable; joking about patients was a very disrespectful thing to do.\n\n\"My apologies.\" Zhou Ze raised a hand, indicating he had spoken wrongly, but still said: \"So, how does your partner want to resolve this issue?\"\n\nLet his \"wife\" die again,\n\nOr, let his daughter become his wife?\n\nA choice between two kinds of happiness.\n\nZhou Ze was also a doctor in his previous life, and by rights, he shouldn't be thinking about this matter with such a joking attitude. But in reality, Zhou Ze couldn't be completely serious, especially from Wang Ke's description; Zhou Ze had already discerned that father's thoughts.\n\nThere were only three ways to solve the problem: keep the daughter, keep the \"wife,\" or keep both.\n\nOf course, there was another extreme way: keep neither. But that would be tantamount to murder, so it was immediately ruled out.\n\nAs a doctor, you should only be responsible for your patient.\n\nIn his previous life, when Zhou Ze saved people in the hospital, he often encountered external obstructions. For example, a pregnant woman had acute inflammation, but her family actually prevented the doctors from giving her an X-ray, saying they were afraid it would affect the child's health. However, in that situation, both the pregnant woman and the child could have died directly from the inflammation.\n\nIn this case, the so-called \"wife\" was merely a virtual personality, a disease the daughter developed due to missing her deceased mother.\n\nTherefore, helping the daughter move past it and break free from the influence of that so-called secondary personality was the correct direction for treatment.\n\nBut Wang Ke was struggling, which meant that the father had chosen the third option: he loved his wife, and he missed his wife, so he hoped to both see his daughter in her and feel that his wife was still alive.\n\n\"He loves his wife very much,\" Wang Ke said.\n\n\"But often, love is actually a disguise for selfishness.\"\n\n\"So, you're unwilling to help?\"\n\n\"I don't know how I can help you.\"\n\n\"You are the most perfect successful case of a secondary personality taking over that I've ever seen. I believe it's possible for you to communicate with that mother's personality. To ensure they can remain in one body and continue harmoniously. The current problem is that the two personalities have begun to show an unstable trend.\n\nThey will slowly cross over and become confused.\n\nAnd then, turn into another stranger.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't do it.\" Zhou Ze looked at Wang Ke. \"Mr. Wang, I remember my good friend Zhou Ze, when he spoke of you in life, said you were a very upright and principled person.\"\n\nWang Ke frowned slightly, but soon relaxed, saying:\n\n\"People change. Without that investor's help, I wouldn't be where I am today.\"\n\nWang Ke stood up, seemingly preparing to leave. Since he couldn't persuade Zhou Ze, he had no reason to linger.\n\n\"I think I bought a lottery ticket, and I forgot to check the winning numbers. Maybe I could win five million, I should check now.\" Zhou Ze suddenly said.\n\n\"That probability is too low,\" Wang Ke smiled faintly.\n\n\"Scratching a lottery ticket, it's like looking at a paternity test. Everyone knows deep down it's useless, but you still can't help but take a look.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze smiled at Wang Ke, and continued:\n\n\"Right?\"\n___\n*   **Ge You slump**: Refers to a famous meme of Chinese actor Ge You slumping on a sofa, embodying extreme laziness and apathy.",

    "content": "Three days passed since he last refused Wang Ke. Zhou Ze had originally forgotten about that matter. These past few days, Bai Yingying, having nothing to do, ran off to Xu Qinglang’s shop to play computer games, while Xu Qinglang, on the other hand, went to the bookstore to chat with Zhou Ze and read newspapers.\n\nAlthough Bureau Chief Zhao had told Xu Qinglang before he left that it’s best not to lie around in a house wasting time in life, Xu Qinglang had agreed.\n\nYes,\nbeing lazy certainly doesn’t lead to success,\nbut,\nbeing lazy can make one comfortable.\n\nXu Qinglang still succumbed. For these three days, his shop hadn’t lit a fire except when Zhou Ze ate and when he himself ate. He hadn’t even opened the food delivery app; it had been in a \"Shop Closed\" state.\n\nAt noon, Zhou Ze had just finished lunch with strawberry juice. While strolling at the bookstore entrance, he saw that familiar red sedan approaching.\n\nThis left Zhou Ze somewhat speechless. Only three days, and this woman was getting her hair done again? Doing hair too often can easily damage the hair quality.\n\nSoon, the woman stopped the car. But then, Wang Ke also got out of the car.\n\nWang Ke jogged up to Zhou Ze, looked at him, and said:\n\n“Help me.”\n\nVery simple,\nand very direct,\njust these two words.\n\nWithout any prior setup, these two words directly extended from the last topic, which was the patient with the mother-daughter fused entity.\n\n“Things have gotten serious; her personality is starting to become chaotic,” Wang Ke said hastily. “You must help me.”\n\nZhou Ze shrugged,\nthe meaning was simple:\nSorry,\nI still don’t want to get involved in this matter.\n\nA simple one-plus-one-equals-two problem had, due to delay, resulted in a more serious issue. This was a man-made disaster, not a natural one. In this, Wang Ke, who considered the investor’s position, had lost his professional ethics and duties as a doctor.\n\n“I don’t have time.” Zhou Ze pointed to his bookstore. “I need to mind the shop.”\n\nHe thought of refusing; he just needed an excuse and a reason, even if the reason and excuse were flimsy, it didn’t matter.\n\n“Whatever your daily turnover is, I’ll compensate you tenfold.” Wang Ke said directly. “Come with me for a trip. I think you can help. She almost succeeded in committing suicide last night. If she hadn’t been discovered early, she’d be a corpse now!”\n\nZhou Ze was in agony.\nHis neighbor was richer than him.\nHis wife was richer than him.\nHis maid was also richer than him.\nAnd now his childhood friend said, “Whatever your daily turnover is, I’ll compensate you tenfold.”\n\nSo disheartening, so disheartening that Zhou Ze even wanted to ask “Little Lolita” to help him check next time they met if he was born with a pauper’s fate. How could he be so poor in both lives?\n\n“This is a matter of sentiment; price can’t measure it.” Zhou Ze really didn’t want to go. He was a surgeon; to be honest, he only knew a little about psychology.\n\n“Come with me for a trip, help me out!” Wang Ke grabbed Zhou Ze’s hand.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze uncomfortable. Even Xu Qinglang, that man more beautiful than a woman, had never made such a gesture toward him. He immediately stepped back, trying to pull his hand away, but Wang Ke held onto his hand tightly.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\nStill forcing people like this?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to get angry, Wang Ke suddenly lowered his voice and said:\n\n“A-Ze, help me!”\n\nZhou Ze’s eyes widened sharply, staring intently at Wang Ke.\nWhat did he just call him?\n\nWang Ke kept taking deep breaths and said: “If this matter isn’t resolved, my career is over. I won’t lie to you, it was me who suggested my investor choose to preserve both personalities. I told him I had the ability to handle the treatment and arrangements well. Now, I’m panicking, I’m at my wit’s end, I can only rely on you.”\n\n“What did you just call me?” Zhou Ze also lowered his voice.\n\nXu Qinglang just walked out of the shop to smoke. He watched the two men outside, holding hands, \"whispering sweet nothings\" and \"huddling together\" to tell secrets quietly; he immediately gasped, felt a terrible toothache, and sighed:\n\n“Indecent, truly indecent.”\n\nWang Ke’s wife and Bai Yingying stood nearby. Seeing their respective men so intimately exchanging secrets, they also found it somewhat hard to understand.\n\n“A-Ze, help me.” Wang Ke repeated.\n\nHe had seen it, he had seen it long ago, but he had been pretending to be foolish, or rather, he wasn’t sure, and this discovery and deduction were too shocking. But at this moment, he could only hope for Zhou Ze’s help.\n\nZhou Ze bit his lip, looked up, and then nodded.\nHe agreed.\nHe also had no choice but to agree.\n\nJust as when he went to Wang Ke’s house to find Wang Ke, directly stating Zhou Ze’s name, Wang Ke immediately put down his most important work to help him see a doctor, now, Wang Ke had spoken his name. He was no longer Xu Le in front of him, but Zhou Ze, and there was no room left for refusal.\n\nAs childhood friends who grew up together in the orphanage, although the two had basically lost contact after finishing their studies and starting work, struggling and striving in their respective fields, the memories of growing up together and supporting each other in childhood still truly existed.\n\n“Let’s go, get in the car.” Wang Ke impatiently opened the car door for Zhou Ze, and Zhou Ze got into the car.\n\nWang Ke and Zhou Ze sat together in the back seat; the woman drove.\n\nInside the car, for a long time, no one spoke. This made the driving woman feel somewhat oppressed, but she didn’t ask anything further.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car window, letting some of the outside wind in, then said:\n\n“How did you find out?”\n\n“Grew up together, daily habits, movements, details.” Saying this, Wang Ke extended a finger and tapped his own head. “Also, I’m in this profession.”\n\nZhou Ze’s lips curved into a smile; he said nothing more.\n\nWang Ke continued: “Once you help me sort this out, I won’t reminisce with you, nor will I contact you again, nor will I bother you again. I also have no other curiosity. On this point, trust me, your brother.”\n\n“Are you still... the old you?” Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n“Last time, someone named Xu Le knocked on my door in the middle of the night saying Zhou Ze introduced him. What did I do?”\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nAfter a while, Zhou Ze said again, “I’m a surgeon.” The meaning was: there’s no use calling me here; I’m not a psychologist. Unless that girl attempted suicide again, he’d have no problem participating in the rescue, but for other matters, he was truly powerless.\n\n“I suspected for a long time that she wasn’t just suffering from dissociative identity disorder.” Wang Ke glanced at his wife who was driving, and said in a lowered voice.\n\n“Oh?” Zhou Ze was stunned for a moment, then understood the meaning. What was similar to “dissociative identity disorder”? Ghost possession! No wonder Wang Ke came to find him last time, saying his second personality could connect with the other party’s second personality.\nDamn it, the implication was:\nYou ghosts can communicate with other ghosts!\nF***!\n\n***\n\nThis was Tongcheng’s^1 most high-end real estate area, located at the foot of Langshan^1, with one luxurious villa after another. When the car drove in, several security guards at the gate saluted the people inside the car.\n\nThis couldn’t help but make Zhou Ze recall the residential community he lived in during his previous life, where the old security guards in the gatehouse basically skipped work and slept at night.\n\nWang Ke, of course, didn’t know that Zhou Ze’s heart was currently suffering from the torment of wealth disparity. He thought Zhou Ze was a bit depressed because he had seen through his identity.\n\nThe car drove to the villa entrance, and a young man came over. He was the butler here.\n\n“Doctor Wang, Mr. Zheng is already angry.” The butler reminded.\n\n“Something happened to Miss Zheng again?” Wang Ke’s expression became serious.\n\n“No... it’s that kind of...” The young butler couldn’t quite articulate it, finally only saying, “No life-threatening danger, this time it’s not suicide.”\n\nWang Ke and Zhou Ze got out of the car and went straight upstairs to the second floor. Wang Ke’s wife did not follow.\n\nThere were many rooms on the second floor, all carpeted in red. The villa was very large, but the decoration style did not appear vulgar or excessively luxurious. It showed that the owner was not a nouveau riche; on the contrary, he seemed to be a person of great taste.\n\nAfter turning a corner, Zhou Ze saw a middle-aged man with half-white hair standing at a bedroom door. The man held a cigar in his hand, his face filled with worry.\n\nWhen he saw Wang Ke and Zhou Ze approaching, a flicker of anger first appeared in his eyes, but it vanished quickly. He then showed a warm yet helpless smile, saying:\n\n“Doctor Wang, Pingping is again...”\n\n“What’s wrong, Mr. Zheng?” Wang Ke was also somewhat anxious. He was the doctor responsible for Zheng Pingping’s treatment. Now that things had turned out this way, he couldn’t shirk responsibility, and he knew in his heart that the wealthy businessman in front of him must be very dissatisfied with him, but the other party knew there was no point in getting angry at this moment, so he had been restraining himself.\n\n“See for yourself.” Mr. Zheng gestured for the two young men at the door to open the bedroom door. Wang Ke and Zhou Ze walked in.\n\nInside, two nannies were attending nearby. In the center, a young girl, wearing a dress with her arm wrapped in cloth strips, was gracefully dancing, while subtly singing a \"Child’s Play\" opera tune.\n\nWang Ke had a look of astonishment.\n“How could this be?”\n\nZhou Ze noticed that the girl’s wrist was bandaged with gauze; she must have just attempted suicide by wrist-slitting but failed to die.\n\nAs the girl danced, she seemed to notice the two people who had entered. She immediately raised her voice, flicked the cloth strip, pointed at Wang Ke, and sang:\n\n“A life fated to loneliness, bringing harm to parents;\nA lifetime of toil and suffering, toiling in vain for others^2,\nTo ultimately end up with wife and children scattered, abandoned by all, miserable, bitter, and sorrowful!”\n\nThe girl sang, brushing her sleeve to wipe away tears, seemingly grieving over this.\n\nWang Ke was somewhat bewildered, not knowing what scene this was from.\n\nBut Zhou Ze understood.\n\nThe girl then waved her sleeve at Zhou Ze, simultaneously singing:\n\n“Orphaned and helpless from youth, drifting anxiously;\nHoping to climb the ladder to success, but destined to die young and fall into the underworld, truly sighing and lamenting...”\n\nAs she sang and sang, sighing and lamenting... the girl suddenly stopped abruptly, like an old cassette player suddenly jamming.\n\nThen the girl showed a bewildered expression, waved her long sleeve again, and sang:\n\n“Born with a handsome facade, but inside, a rustic boor!\nA man’s knees are worth gold^3, but this has nothing to do with you!\nTo ultimately end up as a nobody, having lived in vain on earth for a...”\n\nThis time, the girl jammed again.\n\nThen the girl let out a scream, instantly collapsing onto the floor in fear, with a large wet patch under her pants. Pointing at Zhou Ze, her face full of dread^4, she cried out in fear:\n\n“Ghost... ghost...\nGhost!”\n\n---\nFootnotes:\n1.  **Tongcheng, Langshan**: These are specific place names in China, kept as is.\n2.  **Toiling in vain for others (徒做嫁衣)**: A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"to prepare a bridal gown for someone else,\" implying that one works hard but others reap the benefits.\n3.  **A man's knees are worth gold (男兒膝下有黃金)**: A Chinese saying implying that a man should not easily kneel, symbolizing his dignity and pride.

    "content": "The girl pointed at Zhou Ze and shrieked, but luckily, she was already deranged and her personalities were undifferentiated, so for Zhou Ze, this so-called \"accusation\" had no effect whatsoever.\n\nNo one would believe what a mentally disturbed person says,\n\nand even if a normal person said it, it would be seen as a sign of mental instability.\n\nHowever, the words the girl had sung earlier, borrowing the cadence of \"Tongcheng Children's Opera,\"* might have seemed out of place or just idle gossip to others, but in Zhou Ze's ears, they held an unusual significance.\n\nWhat she sang,\n\nwas a judgment verse!\n\nA judgment verse, as it's called, is a poetic form that summarizes a person's entire life, determining their past and also their future.\n\nFor example, the verse from *Dream of the Red Chamber*, \"From one command, then two, then 'three persons' makes a 'wood'; weeping towards Jinling, the affair grows more sorrowful,\" is Wang Xifeng's judgment verse.\n\nA life of solitude, having brought misfortune upon parents;\nA lifetime of toil and suffering, only to work in vain for others;\nUltimately destined for a scattered family, deserted by all, left in bitter, miserable solitude!\n\nThis referred to Wang Ke. Wang Ke, like Zhou Ze, grew up in an orphanage, and here it implied that Wang Ke had cursed his parents to death. After adulthood, he was too busy with his career to care for anything else. As for the last line, it's easy to understand: family scattered, wife and children separated.\n\nZhou Ze thought Wang Ke might have realized his wife was seeing someone else, but he hadn't exposed it. Furthermore, his daughter had been chosen by a ghost messenger to become a physical vessel.\n\nAnd the judgment verse the girl sang for him afterward:\n\nOrphaned and helpless from childhood, trembling and solitary;\nJust as he climbed the ladder of rapid ascent, he died prematurely, falling into the underworld, truly lamentable...\n\nThis referred to himself: an orphan, who by his own ability became a department head before the age of thirty. Just as he was rapidly ascending, he suddenly died in a car accident.\n\nAs for \"though he has a fine outward appearance, his belly is filled with weeds,\" it refers to Xu Le being splendid on the outside but rotten on the inside. He was quite good-looking, otherwise, he wouldn't have been chosen by the Lin family parents to be their live-in son-in-law.\n\nHere, \"weeds\" does not refer to bandits who kill and loot, but rather that Xu Le, apart from being somewhat handsome, was actually just a blockhead.\n\nThe original line, \"Though he has a fine outward appearance, his belly is filled with weeds,\" was a judgment of Jia Baoyu in *Dream of the Red Chamber*.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze felt the judgment verse's description of Xu Le was quite apt. The Lin family was wealthy, truly wealthy. As a live-in son-in-law, it shouldn't have been difficult for Xu Le to start a business or venture into something. But this guy was like a pretentious literary type, setting up a bookstore that only lost money.\n\nOf course, the girl's final \"jam\" and terror were because she had seen two lives on him.\n\nOne was the physical body,\n\nand one was the soul.\n\nIn that instant,\n\nshe realized she had seen a ghost.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze smile faintly. So, it seemed the girl before him wasn't possessed by a ghost.\n\nHe hadn't yet reached the point of scaring a ghost so badly that it peed itself, like his sister-in-law.\n\nTwo nannies immediately came over, held the girl down, and ceaselessly comforted her.\n\nWang Ke also went over, attempting to dissuade her through words.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, surveyed his surroundings. This was likely the girl's original boudoir, with a pink theme and a princess bed, very cozy and lovely. It was a pity its mistress was now in a state of derangement.\n\nWhat puzzled Zhou Ze was, if this girl wasn't a ghost, then where did the \"Tongcheng Children's Opera\" she had just sung and the incredibly accurate judgment verses come from?\n\n\"Tongcheng Children's Opera\" is a local repertoire from Tongcheng; nowadays, only some elderly people still listen to it, and young people might not even have heard of it. Yet this girl had just sung it very professionally.\n\nCould it be that after her two personalities became disordered and merged, a new personality emerged, and this personality possessed such a special ability?\n\nDon't people often say that there's only a fine line between genius and madness?\n\nBut thinking about it, something still felt off, though he couldn't pinpoint exactly what was wrong.\n\n\"Where's my husband?\"\n\nAt this moment, the girl suddenly spoke in a very steady tone. She pushed away the nannies beside her and stood up.\n\n\"Has my husband come home?\"\n\nWang Ke froze in place,\n\nZhou Ze also slightly parted his lips.\n\nThe role switched just like that?\n\nHad it turned into the matriarchal personality?\n\n\"A-Qiu, I'm here.\" Mr. Zheng walked over at this point, then gestured for everyone else to leave. He wanted to comfort his \"wife.\"\n\nWalking onto the balcony, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Wang Ke asked, standing beside Zhou Ze. His hopes rested on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"It's not ghost possession.\"\n\n\"Is it really a mental issue then?\" Wang Ke pursed his slightly chapped lips. He was now in a difficult predicament, unable to back out.\n\nIn fact, if he had initially adhered to his medical principles and pursued psychological treatment for the girl, things might not have escalated to this point at all.\n\nBut it was too late to say any of this now.\n\nHowever, this couldn't entirely be blamed on Wang Ke alone. He wanted to secure the investors' support, so it was natural for him to go to great lengths to please them.\n\nFurthermore, from the way Mr. Zheng immediately entered after hearing his daughter's personality switch to that of his wife, and from the tone he used to call out \"A-Qiu,\" it was clear that more than half of the problem stemmed from him personally.\n\n\"What is this room used for?\" Zhou Ze asked, pointing to the room next to the bedroom. It was draped in white gauze, and the French windows were completely covered.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze always felt there was something inside that made him quite uncomfortable.\n\n\"It's Miss's art studio,\" a young butler nearby said.\n\n\"Oh, may I go in and take a look?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"This...\" The butler seemed hesitant, then looked at Wang Ke.\n\n\"Let him take a look,\" Wang Ke nodded. \"Understanding more about Miss's situation will also help with the treatment's progress.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe butler immediately went to get the key, opened the door, and then stood outside. Zhou Ze and Wang Ke walked in together.\n\n\"You loved drawing when you were little. I remember you once told me you wanted to be a painter,\" Wang Ke said with some nostalgia.\n\n\"The orphanage didn't have the resources for that back then,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nFor Zhou Ze's situation at the time, studying art was truly impractical, so in the end, after his college entrance exam, he still chose a medical university to make it easier to find a job and support himself.\n\n\"Don't worry, no matter how this turns out, I won't bother you again,\" Wang Ke said with a bitter laugh. \"To be honest, I was scared too. The last time I came to find you, my heart was in my throat the whole time.\"\n\n*Your daughter is a ghost messenger; if you knew that, wouldn't you just faint from fright?*\n\nJust then, the butler called from the doorway, \"Dr. Wang, Mr. Zheng is looking for you.\"\n\n\"I'll go take a look first. I'll see you out later.\" Wang Ke left the art studio, leaving Zhou Ze alone inside.\n\nZhou Ze strolled around the art studio alone, gazing at some of the paintings on the floor and walls, lost in thought. To be honest, while these works clearly showed they were by a young artist, each one seemed to possess a unique spirit, showcasing the painter's inherent talent.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze stopped before an easel draped in black cloth. Without the slightest psychological burden, he directly reached out and pulled back the black cloth. Instantly, Zhou Ze's pupils constricted.\n\nThe painting on the easel was a skull.\n\nIt didn't look special; after all, such skull images are easily found online.\n\nBut this skull gave Zhou Ze the sensation of his heart skipping a beat, and even his breathing seemed to slow down because of it.\n\nIt was a unique feeling, an unusual resonance.\n\nAfter several deep breaths to calm himself, Zhou Ze was able to examine the painting more closely. He then noticed that the skull in the painting had a three-dimensional quality, especially with a spatial fold on the far left.\n\nIt was like the difference between a flat depiction of a book cover and a three-dimensional one.\n\nThis was a copied work, because the girl's previous paintings were all in a gentle, domestic, and idyllic style, but this one was strikingly different from her usual manner!\n\nJudging from the painting,\n\nshe must have copied it from a book, or perhaps a small booklet?\n\nAnd the cover of that book or booklet was this very skull.\n\nZhou Ze began to search around. When the girl painted this, she must have placed the object in front of her to copy, so there was a high probability that it was somewhere in this art studio.\n\nSoon, Zhou Ze found a small, unlocked cabinet in the corner of the studio. Zhou Ze opened it; inside were some illustration booklets and drawing books. After flipping through them, Zhou Ze finally found what he was looking for: a palm-sized booklet that looked somewhat like a driver's license.\n\nHe took it out and placed it in front of himself. The front was the same skull, identical to the one in the painting.\n\nThat was it, the girl had copied this very object.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously flipped open the booklet, but the moment it was opened,\n\nthe girl, who had just fallen asleep in the adjacent bedroom, suddenly opened her eyes, revealing a flash of crimson. Then she leapt directly from the bed. If not for the quick reflexes of the nannies nearby who held her, she might have rushed out of the bedroom.\n\n\"Wuwuwu... Wuwuwu...\"\n\nThe girl struggled desperately, her fingernails carving many bloody streaks across the nannies' faces.\n\n\"What is it now!\"\n\nMr. Zheng rushed back to the bedroom again, heartbroken at the sight of his daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, just a wall away, Zhou Ze remained motionless, holding the booklet open.\n\nHowever, in Zhou Ze's mind, a succession of men and women, old and young, appeared in an instant. They appeared quickly and vanished quickly, but each time one appeared, a few lines of black brushstrokes simultaneously manifested beside them, containing their judgment verses.\n\nFor a moment, the terrifying amount of information made Zhou Ze's head spin.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze tilted his head back, drew in a sharp breath, and simultaneously closed the booklet.\n\nThis was no ordinary skull-themed novelty booklet;\n\nit recorded countless departed souls and the annotations of their lives.\n\nThis was also something Zhou Ze had never seen before.\n\nIt was then that Zhou Ze noticed a burnt mark in the center of the skull on the booklet's cover.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously used his fingernail to touch this mark.\n\nAnd at that very moment, Zhou Ze's black fingernail seemed to grow uncontrollably, and a black aura from his nail swirled into the booklet. The entire booklet became incredibly hot to the touch, yet he couldn't drop it; it was as if it had been branded onto Zhou Ze's flesh.\n\nMeanwhile, the girl in the next room, who had been struggling wildly, suddenly quieted down, as if finally freed, and fell into a deep slumber.\n\nThe painful sensation didn't last long, but it was enough to make Zhou Ze break out in a cold sweat, as if he had just endured the punishment of roasting on a red-hot pillar!\n\n\"Thud...\"\n\nThe booklet fell from Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nZhou Ze hung his head, sweat beads continuously dripping down.\n\nBut he saw two clear lines of blood-red characters emerge on the back of the booklet, which had originally only had a black cover:\n\n\"The Underworld has order,\nThe Yellow Springs can be crossed.\"\n***\n*   **Tongcheng Children's Opera (童子戲):** A specific local operatic genre from Tongcheng, Anhui province.",

    "content": "He picked up the booklet. This time, Zhou Ze didn't feel it hot to the touch; instead, he felt a gentle, cool, and moist sensation, as if he were holding a piece of ancient jade.\n\nA very strange connection seemed to have formed between himself and this booklet.\n\nZhou Ze had read some xianxia novels before, but the feeling at this moment wasn't like a magical artifact recognizing its master, as described in xianxia novels.\n\nThe booklet was still the booklet,\nhe was still him,\nbut inexplicably, Zhou Ze felt a sense of affection towards this item from the bottom of his heart, like a thirty-year-old man holding a photo taken when he was three or five.\n\nStrange, yet incredibly familiar.\n\nHe flipped open the first page of the booklet, and the overwhelming visual images assaulted him again. Zhou Ze closed his eyes, and then, all those chaotic things vanished.\n\nLast time, he had been passively infused;\nthis time, he seemed able to control the flow.\n\nFinally, the first page opened. On it was a handprint. Zhou Ze wasn't sure if it was his own handprint or someone else's, and there was no way to do a detailed fingerprint comparison now. But in fact, this handprint was very strange; Zhou Ze even felt that no one in the world should have a handprint like this.\n\nThe handprint's lines were very harmonious, so harmonious that you couldn't find a single flaw, and incredibly neat. Every detail achieved a very comfortable feeling.\n\nBelow, there were two columns.\nFirst column: Name: Zhou Ze.\nSecond column: Position: Temporary Ghost Messenger.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had a thought earlier: this should be what's called a ghost messenger's identification. More precisely, it was an Underworld Bureau identification. After all, the Underworld Bureau was also a small society; though a sparrow is small, it has all its organs,¹ and ghost messengers were just a part of its positions.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had discussed his current situation before. One very clear point was that his status as a temporary worker was very precarious; he could be used as a scapegoat at any time and had no security or status guarantee whatsoever.\n\nThe little loli, upon her last return, directly admitted this when questioned by him.\n\nAt the same time, she casually painted a grand vision for him,² and didn't care whether he was willing to accept it or not.\n\nThe reason being, what he lacked was precisely this identification!\n\nWith this identification in hand, he wouldn't be an undocumented person. Most importantly, this identification meant he had obtained what was called an \"attendance\" record, just like the establishment and development of the ancient imperial examination system, which opened up a channel for upward mobility from the lower strata.\n\nIn the past few months of running the bookshop, Zhou Ze had lived very idly. It wasn't that Zhou Ze was naturally like that, but because his previous awkward status meant to him that doing more was prone to more mistakes, and doing nothing wasn't a big deal.\n\nSimilar to the mindset of those loss-making state-owned enterprises from ten or twenty years ago.\n\nNow, he could at least set a small goal for himself.\n\nA hundred million was out of the question,\nbut there was hope that through his own efforts, he could raise his rank.\n\nEven a female ghost like Madam Bai, who protected her hometown folks for two hundred years in the human world, could accumulate merit and return to Hell to seek a position. Zhou Ze's starting point was actually much better than Madam Bai's.\n\nWhat made Zhou Ze somewhat uncomfortable, however, was why his current position was still only \"Temporary Ghost Messenger\"?\n\nZhou Ze knew clearly that this was definitely not some ID that Heaven, seeing his \"diligence,\" \"devotion to duty,\" \"exhausting himself for the cause,\" and \"working until death,\" had *poof*-ed over to him.\n\nZhou Ze also knew that with his previous work attitude — fishing for three days and drying nets for two,³ spending every day drinking tea and reading novels in the bookshop, and sleeping with Bai Yingying at night—\n\nIt was already a great mercy that Heaven hadn't directly sent down a bolt of lightning to strike him, this evil spirit, into smithereens. How could it possibly reward him at this moment?\n\nThis was someone else's Underworld Bureau identification,\nbut he had accidentally picked it up.\n\nNo, to be precise, Zheng Pingping had picked it up. But Zheng Pingping was a living person, an ordinary person; she had no way to control this item. She was even affected by it, her mind thrown into chaos by it.\n\nCoupled with the shock of her mother's passing, this led to Zheng Pingping's behavior becoming abnormal.\n\nShe lost her sense of self, because this booklet recorded countless judgment verdicts for the deceased. It was like instantly reading the lives of thousands upon thousands of people.\n\n\"Zhuangzi's morning dream of being a butterfly, or returning to one's village to find the axe handle rotted,\"⁴ basically describes the situation.\n\nLosing oneself, ignoring all changes around. You were originally a grain of sand, and then a great river washed over you. Let alone others, could you even find yourself?\n\nHowever, since he had now \"stolen\" this item, it should also mean that Zheng Pingping's connection with this identification had been severed. Her psychological illness should recover quickly.\n\nHowever, the key issue was, Zhou Ze didn't believe that the previous owner of this item was also a \"Temporary Ghost Messenger.\"\n\nCould a temporary ghost messenger's performance record be so exaggerated?\n\nSo, everyone in Hell was a model worker and an exemplary pioneer of the era?\n\nWere they all goddamn workaholics?\n\nLooking at the little loli's lazy demeanor, she was actually quite similar to him. Otherwise, she wouldn't have left the performance targets for him to do, while she ran off to earn extra money.\n\nUpon closer inspection, Zhou Ze found a faint white smudge over the original positions of his name and \"Temporary Ghost Messenger.\" It looked a bit like it had been covered with correction fluid.\n\nZhou Ze reached out to rub it, even scratching it with his fingernail. But nothing scraped off. The white smudge remained a white smudge.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a bit obsessive. The truth was beneath the white smudge. Originally, the information of the identification's previous owner should have been written here. It was just that the previous owner had most likely kicked the bucket, and he had inherited this identification, and the official rank and other information on the identification had thus been \"refreshed.\"\n\nZhou Ze even thought about going back to the bookshop and asking Bai Yingying to try scrubbing it off with Tide laundry detergent to see if it would work.\n\nThe booklet had several pages. When Zhou Ze turned to the second page, he saw a very simple line of text:\n\n\"Eight percent.\"\n\n\"Is this an experience bar?\" Zhou Ze subconsciously reached out and touched his nose.\n\nIn fact, ancient China already had expressions for \"fractions\" long ago. Of course, not in the modern way people use Arabic numerals with numerator, denominator, and a horizontal line, but rather by describing them directly in this manner.\n\n\"The Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on Celestial Officials\" had writings like \"...two parts of three...eight parts of nine...\" \"Two parts of three\" meant \"two-thirds,\" and \"eight parts of nine\" meant \"eight-ninths.\"\n\nSo, the \"eight percent\" here meant eight percent.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, feeling a bit ashamed. Before, he had felt that the little loli's anger at his slacking off and passive work was somewhat trivial, and thought she was making a fuss over nothing.\n\nBut looking at it now, in the past two months, he had only completed eight percent of the temporary ghost messenger's mission progress. He was indeed lazy enough.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze was also thinking: Did this mean that if he completed the remaining ninety-two percent to reach one hundred percent, his \"Temporary Ghost Messenger\" status could become permanent?\n\nFrom a contract worker to someone with an official position?\n\nZhou Ze hadn't taken this very seriously before. In his previous life, he even disdained those who were determined to burrow into the system. Some of his classmates' families spent hundreds of thousands to operate, finally getting them in. Then they earned two or three thousand a month, yet still felt smug and superior, believing that other classmates who were still working hard to build careers or struggling in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou were merely laborers.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze felt a profound urgency to remove the word \"Temporary\" and enter the Hell establishment!\n\nThis meant security. It meant whether he could sleep soundly tonight without worrying about not seeing tomorrow's sun.\n\nPerhaps, his classmates who were like that back then were also seeking this kind of security. After all, among all professions, nothing was more stable than an iron rice bowl.⁵\n\nZhou Ze still wanted to turn to the next page, but found that the next few pages were stuck together. No matter how he tried to separate them, they wouldn't come apart.\n\nPerhaps, because of his current rank, he wasn't qualified to view the information on the subsequent pages at all?\n\nPutting away the identification, Zhou Ze stretched.\n\nWang Ke was still in the adjacent bedroom. Zheng Pingping had already woken up and was slowly regaining consciousness. Wang Ke was very emotional and excited. As a seasoned psychologist, he could keenly perceive that Zheng Pingping's condition was rapidly improving!\n\nHe didn't know what caused it, but he instinctively made \"an appearance of effort.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the art studio and lit another cigarette. He thought about how he would exert himself after returning to the bookshop. In the future, when there was nothing to do, he'd set up incense and candles with some cold food at the bookshop entrance to attract some wandering ghosts.\n\nThen, without further ado,⁶ he would send them all into Hell for reincarnation.\n\nFor example, the mother from last time who wanted to accompany her son until his college entrance exam before going to Hell. The next time Zhou Ze encountered her, he wouldn't simply wave his hand and let her leave.\n\nYou could say this would be a bit heartless, but the primitive accumulation of capital was inherently this bloody.\n\nTo become permanent sooner,\nZhou Ze would truly do whatever he wanted.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw at the staircase, Wang Ke's wife and the young butler standing there seemingly talking about something. Zhou Ze didn't get too close, but his ears caught phrases like \"when to get her hair done again.\"\n\nAnd honestly, seeing Wang Ke's wife's expression, slightly shy yet forcing composure at that moment, everything was self-evident.\n\nModern butlers were different from before. This was a new profession, and its income was quite high. Generally, only high-end residential areas like this would have modern butlers. They were considered high-level service personnel. Their prestige was no less than that of \"flight attendants\" in people's eyes a decade or so ago.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wouldn't run over shouting and condemning \"the adulterer and adulteress.\" Wang Ke probably guessed something. But since he, as the person involved, deliberately didn't expose it, Zhou Ze, an outsider, had no reason to help.\n\nBut as a childhood friend, with Wang Ke being cuckolded, Zhou Ze naturally felt a bit uncomfortable inside.\n\nMr. Zheng was standing on the balcony, smoking a cigar. His expression was slightly relaxed, because Wang Ke had just told him that his daughter's condition had greatly improved.\n\n\"Mr. Xu, where do you work?\" Only then did Mr. Zheng have the mind to chat with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I run a bookshop.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThere was no other way; facing such a wealthy businessman, he could only pretend to be refined and sophisticated.\n\n\"Oh, very good, very good. I'll visit if I get the chance.\" Mr. Zheng said politely.\n\nZhou Ze then asked, \"Did Miss Zheng just lose control of her bowels and bladder? I, humble as I am, am proficient in some remedies for conditioning the body and mind, strengthening the roots.\"\n\nMr. Zheng's face suddenly darkened upon hearing this. He was a wealthy businessman, so of course he wasn't short of good traditional Chinese doctors. He was angry that Zhou Ze had actually said his daughter was incontinent of both urine and feces right to his face!\n\nIt was clearly only urinary incontinence once, and there was no shit!\n\n\"Thank you for your kind offer, Mr. Xu. My daughter is just a little mentally fatigued; there's nothing wrong with her body.\"\n\nOne doesn't hit a smiling person.⁷ Since Zhou Ze offered to help with remedies, Mr. Zheng naturally couldn't get angry at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze showed a very obvious look of surprise and said:\n\n\"No? But the butler was clearly just talking about this with someone over there, saying Miss's pants were full of...\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze realized that saying it like that seemed impolite and inappropriate. He immediately gave an awkward laugh and said, \"It's good that Miss is fine, it's good that she's fine.\"\n\n---\nFootnotes:\n¹ **Though a sparrow is small, it has all its organs (麻雀雖小五臟俱全)**: A Chinese idiom meaning something is small but complete, containing all the necessary components.\n² **Painted a grand vision (畫大餅)**: A Chinese idiom meaning to make a big promise without substance; a \"pie in the sky\" promise.\n³ **Fishing for three days and drying nets for two (三天打魚兩天曬網)**: A Chinese idiom describing inconsistent or irregular work habits.\n⁴ **\"Zhuangzi's morning dream of being a butterfly, or returning to one's village to find the axe handle rotted\" (莊生曉夢迷蝴蝶，又或者到鄉翻似爛柯人)**: These are two classical Chinese allusions.

    "title": "Chapter 66: Falling in Love with a Wild Horse",
    "content": "Mr. Zheng asked the two to stay for dinner. Zhou Ze refused, and Wang Ke also refused, putting on an air of profoundly hidden achievements and fame. Zhou Ze didn't expose him, knowing that his childhood friend needed this favor from the investor, so he let him be.\n\nOn the way back, Zhou Ze didn't see the young butler. However, Zhou Ze knew that after he had \"accidentally\" let slip some information, Mr. Zheng had given a few words of instruction to his two escorts, and then the butler disappeared.\n\nWang Ke's wife was still driving. She seemed a bit absent-minded, checking her phone from time to time.\n\nWang Ke himself was immersed in the emotional waves of relief after surviving a calamity. Miss Zheng's condition was rapidly improving, and his pressure had consequently lifted.\n\nZhou Ze didn't tell Wang Ke about the butler and how he had deliberately badmouthed him in front of Mr. Zheng. It was merely a casual act born of boredom, and he wouldn't seek any credit for it.\n\nThe crucial issue was that Zhou Ze didn't know which way Wang Ke's emotional leanings truly swayed. Although they were childhood friends, so many years had passed, and everyone had their own experiences, naturally leading to their own changes.\n\nWhat if, after he told him, Wang Ke felt:\n\n\"I treat you as a brother, yet you want to take off the green hat on my head!\"^1\n\nDammit,\n\nInsolent,\n\nUnbearable!\n\nWhat then?\n\nLooking again at Wang Ke's wife, who was driving, also his sister-in-law, Zhou Ze slightly pursed his lips.\n\nIndeed,\n\nA wife's heart is a knife.\n\nHis phone rang. Zhou Ze answered; it was his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hello, Xu Le, my sister has started working.\" His sister-in-law spoke.\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze responded unhurriedly.\n\n\"She hasn't been feeling well lately. You should go see her. Don't let her get too tired.\" His sister-in-law added.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I say, what's wrong with you? This big miss^2 is giving you a heads-up, and not only do you not thank me, you don't even show a hint of excitement.\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh your head!\n\nLet me tell you, that Maserati business of yours still hasn't been explained clearly!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. His sister-in-law was truly trying to help him. The reason was simple: lately, when she went out to have fun, her excuse and reason were always that she was studying at his bookstore.\n\nHis own sister was busy with work and had no time. Although her brother-in-law was a good-for-nothing, this good-for-nothing was at least a university student and could still tutor her homework.\n\nA very good reason, and a very good excuse.\n\nEven the Lin family parents, who usually couldn't stand Xu Le, tacitly approved of their youngest daughter going to the bookstore for tutoring.\n\nSometimes Zhou Ze really couldn't resist going back to the Lin family's home and pointing at the Lin family parents' noses to tell them, let alone a university graduate,\n\neven if you let second or third-year university students tutor high school students, how many do you think could actually do it?\n\nBut his sister-in-law still had some conscience. This silly girl, judging from recent events, was alright apart from being a bit foolish.\n\nSee? She even specifically gave him a heads-up.\n\n\"Alright, thank you,\" Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n\"Hmph, by the way, I'm still coming to your place to read tonight,\" his sister-in-law added.\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Zhou Ze stretched, only to unexpectedly find that the car was just passing by the West Gate of the People's Hospital.\n\nWhat a coincidence,\n\nHe hadn't intended to go.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze didn't ask Wang Ke's wife to stop the car, pretending he hadn't seen it, not wanting to take advantage of the coincidence.\n\nDr. Lin had started working, indicating she had somewhat recovered. However, Zhou Ze had just received his certification and was preparing to go all out to become regular staff sooner, so he temporarily had no energy to entertain other thoughts.\n\nHowever, Wang Ke's wife voluntarily turned the car into the hospital.\n\n\"My father-in-law was recently hospitalized. I'm just stopping by to see him, I'll be quick.\" Wang Ke apologized to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Never mind, I'll go first.\"\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the car door and got out.\n\nWang Ke also got out. Wang Ke's wife drove the car into the hospital's underground parking lot.\n\n\"Are you taking a taxi back yourself?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Alright then, brother, take care.\" Wang Ke reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder. \"I won't actively seek you out again, but if you need anything, you can come to me.\"\n\n\"You're too kind,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAfter speaking, Wang Ke looked at Zhou Ze earnestly for another moment, then turned and walked towards the Inpatient Building.\n\nZhou Ze silently lit a cigarette. People, indeed, change.\n\nWang Ke was a few years older than him and had graduated and entered society earlier. The \"Brother Wang\" and \"Brother Erdan\" of his past now seemed somewhat unfamiliar to Zhou Ze.\n\nAt his wits' end, he didn't hesitate to consult ghosts and spirits.\n\nSigh.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring. After a moment of thought, he still walked into the Emergency Department Building ahead.\n\nIf he hadn't heard his sister-in-law's heads-up, he could have not come;\n\nIf the car had passed the hospital, he could have pretended not to see it;\n\nBut now that he was already at the hospital, not going to see his own wife seemed a bit indefensible.\n\nBefore, he had an obsession: she wouldn't sleep with him.\n\nBut now, wasn't that obsession gone?\n\nNo, it seemed that after that obsession was gone, some strange new problem had appeared.\n\n\"You can't get it up again. What's the use of thinking so much? Get lost!\"\n\nA woman's icy voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, turned around. His fingernails felt an impulse to grow out.\n\n\"Hey, wife, didn't the doctor say I'm fine after examining me? Maybe it's just because you don't dress sexy enough, and you're not proactive enough in bed, you can't hit my G-spot.\"\n\n\"Get lost! I'm not willing to serve you! You can't even handle it in bed yourself and you want my help? Are you even a man?\"\n\nThe woman and man had probably just come out of the Male Urology Department and were arguing.\n\nZhou Ze's expression was somewhat bitter.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nit was as if that diligent crow appeared again, flying overhead,\n\nand let out \"caw... caw... caw...\" sounds.\n\nOn the ground, a fallen leaf coincidentally appeared again, blown by the wind, flipping over Zhou Ze's foot.\n\nZhou Ze no longer wanted to go into the Emergency Department Building.\n\nHe felt he should give Dr. Lin more time to think, to accept, to adapt, and shouldn't stimulate her at this moment.\n\nYes,\n\nhe should think more for her, give her more time and space; he couldn't force her.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, feeling he had convinced himself, and prepared to leave.\n\nBut just then, an ambulance drove into the hospital, and Zhou Ze saw several doctors and nurses run out of the Emergency Department Building, among them a familiar figure.\n\nDr. Lin also saw Zhou Ze and froze for a moment. Zhou Ze gave her a slight smile, walked over, and said gently:\n\n\"I was just about to go up and see you.\"\n\nDr. Lin suddenly clutched her lower abdomen and sat down on the steps.\n\n\"What's wrong? Not feeling well?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nDr. Lin shook her head and said, \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"What exactly is wrong with your body?\" Zhou Ze asked carefully. He remembered his sister-in-law telling him that Dr. Lin hadn't been feeling well these past few days.\n\n\"Woman troubles,\" Dr. Lin said, lowering her head.\n\nThe iceberg goddess, at this moment, also showed a hint of bashfulness.\n\nGot her period?\n\nZhou Ze felt a moment of speechlessness. Perhaps, for a silly girl like his sister-in-law, having her period was the most painful thing.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, the patient's condition is a bit serious. She's pregnant.\"\n\nA young male doctor rushed over, pushing a stretcher. He seemed a bit nervous, then, seeing Zhou Ze, his expression changed, and he immediately said:\n\n\"You're here too?\"\n\nLast time Zhou Ze entered the hospital to perform an emergency surgery, and incidentally confessed to Dr. Lin, this was the intern who had been utterly flustered that day.\n\n\"Go inside first, I'll take a look.\"\n\nDr. Lin forced herself to stand up, preparing to check the patient's condition.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow her inside.\n\nAfter arriving at the Emergency Department Building, the young girl who accompanied the pregnant woman kept asking the male intern something. The male intern was a bit overwhelmed and extremely flustered.\n\n\"Do you even know how to examine patients? Hurry up! Can't you see my sister's in so much pain? What's wrong with the baby? My brother's thirty, and it's so hard for him to finally have this child, do you know how difficult it is?!\"\n\n\"I... please wait... let me check again...\" The male intern began to get nervous, even dropping the notepad in his hand.\n\n\"What 'you'? Hey, don't you have other doctors here? You can't just recklessly disregard human life!\" The young woman continued to bluster.\n\n\"I'll go take a look.\" Dr. Lin, who was behind, quickened her steps to check the situation, but after a few steps, she grimaced in pain again.\n\n\"Your problem is a bit serious,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Irregular diet lately has made your body unwell.\"\n\nDr. Lin said nothing but still walked towards the patient.\n\n\"Never mind, I'll go take a look.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Dr. Lin on the waist.\n\n\"You...\" Dr. Lin felt this was somewhat inappropriate.\n\n\"You don't trust my medical skills?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"You were trained by me.\"\n\nIt's just that, back then, I didn't expect you to become so beautiful later. My blindness was my fault.\n\nZhou Ze voluntarily walked to the patient's side, preparing to examine her.\n\nThe young woman immediately shouted, \"Who are you? Hey, what are you doing!\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't wearing a white coat.\n\n\"Doctor, please take a look.\" The intern seemed to have found a savior.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the young woman and said, \"I'm about to get off work. If you don't want me to examine her, I'll just go home.\"\n\nThe young woman immediately apologized with a forced smile: \"I'm sorry, I was wrong. Please, quickly examine my sister. She's not due yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the gloves from the intern's hand, then performed an examination, and asked:\n\n\"How far along is the pregnancy?\"\n\n\"28 weeks,\" the young girl answered for her sister.\n\nThe intern looked at Zhou Ze, assisting him.\n\n\"Premature rupture of membranes, cervix fully dilated, severe amniotic fluid contamination,\" Zhou Ze said while taking off his gloves.\n\n\"This... this is going to... going to...\" The young girl was instantly terrified.\n\n\"Preterm labor,\" Zhou Ze uttered these two words, then told the intern, \"Notify the OB/GYN Department to prepare for surgery.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The intern immediately took out his phone and made the call.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head helplessly. This guy was lucky he wasn't assigned to intern under him. Otherwise, with his old temper towards Dr. Lin, he might have verbally abused this guy until he changed professions. He was truly stupid.\n\n\"Preterm labor?\" The young girl was stunned upon hearing this, then grabbed Zhou Ze's arm and said, \"Doctor, please, save my sister, save the baby in her belly! It's so hard for my brother to have this child, truly so difficult.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained unmoved. As a doctor, he had seen too many such cases. If he cried every time, doctors would probably turn into dried husks of people.\n\n\"Then go ask your brother what exactly happened. It's so hard to have a child, how did it end up like this?\"\n\n\"Doctor, what exactly happened?\" The young woman couldn't quite understand.\n\n\"This is caused by unhygienic and excessively forceful sexual activity during pregnancy, with a large amount of internal ejaculation.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the woman on the bed and asked:\n\n\"When a man gets carried away, he's an animal. Couldn't you have persuaded him for the sake of the child in your belly?\"\n\nNearly thirty weeks pregnant, and you couldn't even endure that?\n\nThe pregnant woman on the bed said nothing, seemingly very nervous and scared.\n\nBut the young girl who accompanied her exploded, shouting:\n\n\"That's impossible! My brother went to Beijing to work before the New Year to earn money for baby formula, and he hasn't been back for half a year!\"\n\n\"Fell in love with a wild horse, but my home has no grassland...\"^3\n\nThe intern's phone rang. He immediately answered and then told Zhou Ze:\n\n\"The OB/GYN Department says the operating room is ready.\"\n***\n^1 \"Green hat\" (綠帽子) is a Chinese idiom referring to a cuckolded man.\n^2 \"This big miss\" (本大小姐) is a self-referential term used by a young woman, often implying a spoiled, proud, or self-important demeanor.\n^3 This is a lyric from the popular Chinese song \"Go to Wukang Road\" (去武康路) or \"South of the Border\" (南方), famously sung by Song Dongye (宋冬野). It implies a love for something wild and unrestrainable that cannot be accommodated by one's current circumstances. Here, it is ironically used as a phone ringtone at a moment of revelation about infidelity.",

    "title": "Chapter 67: My Lord, Spare Me!",
    "content": "「Sent to Obstetrics and Gynecology.」\n\nZhou Ze sat beside Doctor Lin, looking at her still somewhat unwell face, and said:\n\n「You should rest more, otherwise you're being irresponsible.」\n\n「I can handle it.」Doctor Lin shook her head, still a bit stubborn.\n\n「What I mean is, in your current physical state, you're being irresponsible to your patients.」\n\n「............」Doctor Lin.\n\n「Heh heh.」Zhou Ze licked his lips, apologizing: 「My bad, I unconsciously slipped back into my old self.」\n\n「That's good.」Doctor Lin said softly.\n\n「Go back and rest. Come back to work when your body has recovered. A doctor's work is indeed very important, but it's not like society will stop functioning just because one working doctor is temporarily absent.」\n\nDoctor Lin nodded.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He looked at the caller ID; it was Xu Qinglang.\n\nHe stood up and walked to the stairwell entrance outside to answer the call:\n\n「Hello, what is it?」\n\n「Your place has good business today, come back quickly and take a look,」 Xu Qinglang said, yawning.\n\n「Good business?」Zhou Ze was a bit happy. He had just gotten his license, and business was already delivering itself to his doorstep?\n\n「Okay, I'm coming back right away.」\n\nZhou Ze decided that this time, no matter how many stories of injustice more profound than 「Dou E's Grievance」¹ the departed souls in the bookstore told, he would impartially send these fellows to hell.\n\nThey were departed souls;\n\nsending them to hell was the righteous path. Being impartial, there was no psychological burden.\n\n「If you have something, go back first,」 Doctor Lin pointed to her office. 「I'll go back myself later.」\n\nZhou Ze nodded, saying nothing more. Nothing was more important now than his early regularization, and as for his relationship with Doctor Lin, they could take it slow.\n\nEven at night, the elevators in the Emergency Building were still packed. Zhou Ze simply chose to take the stairs down. When he reached the third floor, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped.\n\nFor some reason, he always felt as if someone was following him.\n\nCould it be Doctor Lin wanting to take a few more glances at him but feeling embarrassed, so she was secretly following him?\n\nOkay, although there was such a possibility, Zhou Ze wasn't so narcissistic as to actually believe it directly. He quickly walked down another floor, then abruptly turned around at a corner and walked back.\n\n「Whoosh............」\n\nA gust of wind swept down from above.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly looked up and started running upwards, but still found nothing.\n\nFinding nothing proved that something was definitely amiss.\n\nZhou Ze bent down, his black index fingernail extended, and he gently tapped the tiled floor.\n\nThe next moment, a black footprint appeared on the tiled floor. Zhou Ze silently clenched his index finger into a fist and hid it, then slowly stood up and walked in the direction of the continuously appearing black footprints below.\n\nFrom his fingernail, an invisible smoke constantly emanated, relentlessly tracing the marks below.\n\nDue to its unique nature, hospitals are rarely absolutely clean, but it wasn't late at night yet, so for a \"dirty thing\" to dare to walk around so brazenly was very abnormal.\n\nFollowing the marks, Zhou Ze arrived at the fourth floor. The footprints led out and then turned into a patient room.\n\nThe patient room had patients. Given the current situation of extremely strained medical resources, an empty patient room was a rare sight. For instance, right now, some patients could only temporarily lie on makeshift beds in the corridor to rest or receive IV drips.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pushed open the patient room door.\n\nInside were three beds.\n\nOn the two side beds lay elderly people, both old women. In the middle lay a young woman, and beside each bed was a caregiver.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze walked in, everyone in the patient room, except for one sleeping old woman, looked at him.\n\n「Hello, excuse me, did anyone just come in?」\n\nZhou Ze asked directly, getting straight to the point.\n\n「No.」\n\nA caregiver auntie replied.\n\nThe others also shook their heads.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he understood, then turned and left the patient room.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze intended to leave.\n\nYou couldn't blame Zhou Ze for lacking public spirit by not catching a ghost he encountered. One should know that Xu Qinglang had just called, saying his shop now had 「very good business.」 Zhou Ze worried that if he returned late, all the customers would be gone, and the loss would be significant.\n\nAs for the 「dirty thing」 running outside, if he encountered it and could resolve it, he would. But if it was troublesome or wanted to play hide-and-seek with him, Zhou Ze truly wasn't willing to spend too much energy on it.\n\nHe was a ghost messenger, with the prefix 「temporary」 still attached. He wasn't Zhang Tianshi.\n\nHowever, as Zhou Ze grabbed the doorknob, preparing to close the door, his fingernail accidentally brushed against it.\n\nIn an instant, Zhou Ze felt a sensation like static electricity. Immediately after, the lights in the patient room suddenly went out, then the light resumed.\n\nThe three beds in the patient room instantly emptied. The patients, along with their caregivers, had also vanished.\n\nZhou Ze abruptly took two steps back. Only then did he see that the sign on the door of the room he was facing read 「Storage Room.」 This wasn't a patient room!\n\n「Whoosh............」\n\nAnother gust of wind blew in, very fast, as if realizing its illusion had failed and intending to flee in a hurry.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed, as if seizing something cold and fleshy, but then there was a crisp sound, and the thing slipped from his grasp.\n\nThe wind dispersed.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his palm; there was a clump of black hair. It was very long and winding, like the hair he saw every day during his shower from another dense area of his body besides his head.\n\nSeemingly out of professional habit, Zhou Ze placed his palm before his nose and sniffed.\n\nA strong, putrid, marine stench wafted over.\n\nIt was simply nauseating,\n\nlike the smell of a salted fish left piled in a stuffy warehouse for a month.\n\n「Hiss......」\n\nZhou Ze suppressed his urge to gag dryly, squatted down again, and tapped his fingernail on the tile. Another string of clear black footprints appeared.\n\nClapping his hands, Zhou Ze tilted his neck, then followed the footprints directly again.\n\nThe nature of the matter had changed again. If the other party was merely like the old woman lingering in the morgue of the affiliated hospital over inheritance issues, Zhou Ze wouldn't relentlessly pursue it. After all, there were too many such spirits lingering in the human world due to their earthly attachments, and they generally didn't have the intention or the ability to cause harm or destruction.\n\nBut the one he had just encountered, not only actively followed him, but could also create extremely realistic illusions that almost fooled him. Moreover, judging by the body hair he pulled from it, the thing had a physical form.\n\nThis meant the other party already possessed the ability to cause trouble, and it was in the hospital where his wife was. Zhou Ze now found it difficult to convince himself to stand by idly with a clear conscience.\n\nIn the end,\n\nhe was still a glutton for punishment!²\n\nIn the past few months, Zhou Ze had read many novels in the bookstore. What he disliked the most were those 「Saint Mary」³ protagonists, completely lacking any sense of immersion. But when it came to himself, he found he still couldn't completely let go.\n\nOf course, there was another extremely important reason: he had just become a ghost messenger. According to the information he gathered from his conversations with the little loli back then, if a 「dirty thing」 caused trouble in a ghost messenger's territory, that ghost messenger would be implicated and suffer consequences.\n\nThe footprints led upstairs. Zhou Ze followed the footprints all the way to the eighth floor. This was the operating room floor. After ascending the stairs, Zhou Ze didn't take much effort to find his target.\n\nA fellow in a white lab coat was leaning against the corner of the operating room wall, pressing his ear to the wall with one hand while the other hand was fidgeting below, doing things many otaku would do at home.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze approached, the other party didn't turn around, but Zhou Ze saw its body tremble slightly, and it sped up the friction in its hand, as if his arrival had allowed it to enhance some kind of pleasure.\n\n「You are a ghost messenger. I don't wish to offend you, but why relentlessly pursue me? We can perfectly well keep to our own business⁴.」\n\nThe other party's voice was a bit hoarse, like an old man speaking, but the tone was strange, often pronouncing several syllables very quickly.\n\n「I'm waiting for my woman to come out,」 the other party replied. 「Senior messenger, please go back. Losing face is bad for both of us. I can assure you I won't do anything harmful to others, nor will I make things difficult for you.\n\nHeaven's Way is above; I wouldn't dare to act wantonly.」\n\n「Your woman? Who are you waiting for?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\nCould it be another human-ghost romance?\n\nBut just then, from the other side of the operating room corridor, the young girl who had accompanied his sister-in-law earlier ran out with various bills and receipts, presumably to pay.\n\nInside,\n\nlay the pregnant woman who was about to miscarry!\n\n「You are not her husband,」 Zhou Ze rebuked.\n\n「The woman I set my eyes on is my woman. Plus, she and I have a destined karmic bond that needs to continue. Even Heaven's will permits this,」 the other party's tone was very impatient.\n\nZhou Ze was the one who first examined the pregnant woman. He had originally thought he had encountered another 「green hat」⁵ incident. He had even lamented that he himself had encountered similar problems,\n\nhis childhood friend was already experiencing such problems,\n\nand now, even when he went to a hospital to see a patient, he encountered such a problem.\n\nIt seemed he recently encountered 「environmentally-colored」⁶ incidents everywhere he went.\n\nHe even had an impulse to rename his bookstore 「Green Book House,」\n\nto respond to the nation's call for environmental protection.\n\nFortunately, this time it wasn't just a simple melodramatic 「environmentally-colored」 incident, but it seemed even more troublesome than a simple 「environmentally-colored」 one.\n\n「One corpse, two lives,」 Zhou Ze reminded, taking two steps forward at the same time. 「If her surgery isn't successful now, it will be one corpse, two lives. And you say you're not doing anything harmful to others.」\n\n「You, ghost messenger, have you eaten a bear's heart and leopard's guts⁷?!」\n\nThe other party seemed unable to suppress its rage,\n\nand turned around directly.\n\nIt was wearing a doctor's white lab coat. Its back previously revealed nothing, but once it turned around, its terrifying and hideous form was immediately revealed.\n\nThis was a monkey,\n\na monkey that could stand in humanoid form.\n\nMost of its body was already incredibly rotten, and even its skull was missing, empty inside. But the thing below it, like an ox whip, swung back and forth, appearing very disgusting.\n\n「You are nothing more than a lowly ghost messenger at the bottom of the Underworld. Don't push your luck!」\n\n「Then what are you, thing?」 Zhou Ze retorted, then took a few more steps forward.\n\n「Screech, screech, screech!」\n\nThe monkey bared its teeth and snarled, emitting a low growl from its mouth. Then, the black tail behind it suddenly stood upright, immediately plunging into the tiles.\n\nThe next moment,\n\naround Zhou Ze's position, small black holes appeared on the ceiling, tiles, and walls.\n\nFrom these small holes, long tails emerged, beginning to swarm towards Zhou Ze.\n\nThese tails carried an extremely putrid, fishy smell, and mucus dripped from them. For Zhou Ze, who always had a cleanliness fetish, he now felt as if he was standing in the most intensely odorous area of a seafood market.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nthis scene,\n\nhe had seen it before,\n\nin many movies.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands open, his black fingernails fully extended. In the depths of his eyes, a black glow also circulated.\n\nHonestly, besides that one time he beat Bai Yingying, he hadn't truly fought a proper fight.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze was that\n\nthe booklet he kept in his pocket surprisingly began to warm slightly at this moment, as if it too was a bit impatient.\n\nA little excited,\n\nand a little expectant,\n\nhe had just gotten his license, just like someone who had just obtained a driver's license always wanted to try driving.\n\nZhou Ze genuinely wanted to fight now.\n\nHowever, a scene that somewhat surprised Zhou Ze appeared: just as his certificate began to warm slightly,\n\nthe monkey, which had just been so arrogant and contemptuous of him as merely a lowly ghost messenger of the Underworld, suddenly knelt down, repeatedly kowtowing to him, hitting its head against the ground, and cried out:\n\n「Lord Prefect, spare my life! Lord Prefect, spare my life! This beast knows its mistake, this beast knows its mistake!」\n\nFor a moment,\n\nZhou Ze, who had been full of enthusiasm, felt somewhat suspended in mid-air, neither up nor down,\n\nlike someone who had done all the foreplay: sprayed on the delay spray,\n\ntaken Viagra, put on the chocolate-flavored Smurf condom⁸, set up the adult film, prepared the red wine,\n\nonly for the beauty in bed to lift the covers and reveal it was freaking Xu Qinglang!\n\n---\n¹ **Dou E's Grievance:** A famous Chinese play about an unjustly executed woman, a classic tale of profound injustice.\n² **glutton for punishment:** The original Chinese idiom (犯賤) literally means \"to commit cheapness\" or \"to be lowly,\" often used self-deprecatingly to describe someone who invites trouble or seeks out unpleasant situations, despite knowing better. \"Glutton for punishment\" captures this nuance well.\n³ **\"Saint Mary\" protagonist:** (聖母, shèngmǔ) Literally \"Holy Mother\" or \"Saint Mary,\" a Chinese internet slang term used to describe a character (usually female) who is excessively compassionate, forgiving, or self-sacrificing to a fault, often leading to negative consequences or appearing unrealistic/annoying.\n⁴ **keep to our own business:** The original Chinese idiom (井水不犯河水, jǐng shuǐ bù fàn hé shuǐ) literally means \"well water doesn't interfere with river water,\" meaning to mind one's own business and not interfere with others.\n⁵ **\"green hat\" incident:** (戴綠帽子, dài lǜ mào zi) Literally \"wearing a green hat,\" a Chinese idiom meaning a husband has been cheated on by his wife.\n⁶ **\"environmentally-colored\" incidents:** (環保色, huánbǎo sè) Literally \"environmentally-colored,\" a pun on the Chinese word for \"green\" (綠色, lǜsè) which is also the color associated with being cheated on. Here, it refers to incidents involving infidelity or cuckolding, humorously linking them to \"green\" and thus \"environmental protection.\"\n⁷ **eaten a bear's heart and leopard's guts:** (吃了熊心豹子膽, chī le xióng xīn bào zi dǎn) An idiom meaning to be extremely bold, audacious, or reckless.\n⁸ **chocolate-flavored Smurf condom:** The term \"藍精靈\" (lán jīnglíng) literally means \"Smurf\" (the cartoon characters), and is used colloquially in this context to refer to a blue condom. The \"chocolate-flavored\" part adds to the comedic vulgarity of the description.",

    "content": "**Prefect Lord?**\n\nThis surely wasn't a form of address for him. Zhou Ze's ID clearly stated his name in the first field, and unambiguously listed his position as 'Temporary Ghost Catcher' in the second.\n\nMoreover, it couldn't be an honorific. For instance, during the Republic of China era, common folk would address a soldier as 'Lao Zong'*. If a Temporary Ghost Catcher could be addressed as Prefect Lord, then wouldn't such an honorific be too common and worthless in Hell?\n\nTherefore,\n\nthe problem must lie with the little booklet he had just acquired.\n\nThis ID previously had an owner. Even though it had been 'refreshed' after Zhou Ze obtained it, there should still be some residual information from its previous owner on it.\n\nAll in all,\n\nhe had picked up the relic of a formidable individual, and had done so with effortless ease.\n\nOf course, at this moment, Zhou Ze had no time to gloat or indulge in celebrating with a glass of red wine. Instead, he felt a slight sense of disappointment, as he hadn't gotten to fight this uglified version of Monkey King.\n\nBut since his opponent had chickened out, Zhou Ze naturally wouldn't be so perverse as to squat down and encourage his opponent to quickly regain confidence in life and stand up to hit him, hit him, hit him!\n\nSince this was a beautiful misunderstanding, then let this misunderstanding continue.\n\nZhou Ze silently walked towards the monkey, with one hand clasped behind his back, actually subconsciously imitating the little loli's cool pose, to prolong the other party's misconception.\n\nWhen he reached the opponent, the monkey was still kowtowing incessantly. Its skull appeared to have been dug open, and it was hollow inside. In fact, apart from its 'ox penis,' which was perfectly intact, the rest of its body was decayed and damaged.\n\nZhou Ze extended a hand, his fingernail touching the center of the monkey's brow.\n\n\"Give me your soul blood.\"\n\nZhou Ze said calmly.\n\n\"I humbly obey Your Prefect Lordship's decree.\"\n\nThe monkey was filled with awe and wholeheartedly subservient, and from the center of its brow, a black earthworm emerged.\n\nZhou Ze used his fingernail to pinch the earthworm and began pulling it out. The earthworm grew longer and thicker.\n\nPreviously, Xu Qinglang had suggested that Zhou Ze take Bai Yingying's soul blood, as this would be equivalent to controlling Bai Yingying's vital weakness. Zhou Ze now intended to use the same method, first taking advantage of the monkey's disoriented state to completely gain control over it.\n\nHowever, this monkey's soul blood was truly thick and robust, which also indirectly indicated how terrifying this monkey was.\n\nWhy had this monkey suddenly appeared in the city?\n\nJust then, the soul blood suddenly got stuck. Zhou Ze pulled hard, but it wouldn't budge.\n\nThe monkey, which had originally worn a look of reverence, also froze for a moment, its gaze suddenly becoming incomparably clear!\n\nFor the high and mighty Prefect Lord to extract its soul blood, this was its honor, a decree it could not defy. But why was it so difficult for the high and mighty Prefect Lord to even extract its own soul blood?\n\nSuddenly, the monkey's mouth split open, letting out a fierce shriek, and its claws struck directly at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt as if he had been hit by a large truck. But as he was sent flying, his fingernail instantly exerted force, directly severing the opponent's soul blood.\n\n\"CRASH!\"\n\nZhou Ze crashed through the glass behind him, his entire body falling amidst the shards. He raised his head, his chest heaving, blood oozing from the corner of his mouth, and his entire body was in excruciating pain.\n\n\"Damn it, you're not the Prefect Lord! You scoundrel, how dare you impersonate the Prefect Lord!\"\n\nThe monkey began to go mad. Although its soul blood hadn't been fully extracted by Zhou Ze, because it had been severed by Zhou Ze, even if it couldn't kill it instantly, it was enough to destroy its foundation for cultivation.\n\nZhou Ze struggled to prop himself up and stand. His body was covered in cuts from the glass shards, making him look utterly disheveled.\n\nHowever, at this moment, the monkey, like a crazed beast, lunged directly at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nThe man and the monkey collided. Only this time, the monkey's force was much weaker than before. Man and monkey tangled together, rolling several times on the ground.\n\n\"This is my destiny, and also my karma. The Heavenly Dao permits it; debts must be repaid, it is only right and proper! You, a mere Ghost Catcher, why do you interfere? Do you truly consider yourself one of the Ten Yama Kings of Hell?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Instead, he fiercely plunged his fingernails into the monkey's body. Pus continuously steamed out from within the monkey's body. The stench was so potent that even wearing a gas mask probably wouldn't help in the slightest.\n\nFinally, after a round of grappling, the monkey's body slumped, losing all strength, and collapsed to one side. Zhou Ze stumbled to his feet, the fingernails on all ten of his fingers already mostly corroded.\n\nHe was someone who cherished his fingernails. Even in his previous life, while wielding a scalpel, he often trimmed his nails. Not to mention in this life, where his fingernails were even more important to him, and thus even more treasured.\n\nBut at the moment, this was not the time to fret over such things. Zhou Ze felt a chill of fear in his heart. If it hadn't been for the ID in his hand deceiving the opponent, allowing him to get the first move and sever the opponent's soul blood, then after this round of confrontation, the one lying on the ground might have been himself.\n\nThis wasn't a ghost; this was a demon. Zhou Ze cursed himself repeatedly in his mind. Why did he follow? He almost got himself killed.\n\nHumans were just such complex creatures. They could be impulsively driven by a momentary sense of justice and so-called conscience to do things without considering the consequences, but then often regret it immensely, feeling like an idiot.\n\nZhou Ze felt that next time he encountered such a situation, he should call the police uncles and let them handle it. That way, he could leave with a clear conscience.\n\nMadam Bai had stayed in Tongcheng for two hundred years, and didn't the little loli turn a blind eye?\n\nShaking his head, he discarded the jumbled thoughts in his mind. Zhou Ze looked at the monkey beside him.\n\nThe monkey's mouth was open, its eyes beginning to grow dim. Its body, at this moment, began to slowly shrivel like a deflating balloon, but it wasn't dead yet, because it could still speak.\n\n\"I cultivated for three Jiazi periods**, gained opportunities, performed good deeds, became a spirit, and glimpsed the Great Dao… As a creature of a different kind, it was truly not easy to attain enlightenment in the Yang world.\"\n\nEveryone, it seemed, liked to recall their past before dying, describing how amazing and difficult their lives had been. This monkey's mentality, in fact, was not much different from a human's.\n\n\"Cultivated for so many years, yet couldn't control that thing downstairs.\" Zhou Ze spat out a mouthful of blood, his teeth also covered in bloody streaks.\n\n\"One Jiazi, one physical body; one Jiazi, one rebirth through transformation.\" The monkey's voice began to grow faint, but it still carried immense resonance,\n\n\"Every Jiazi, I would re-transform my physical body and cultivate from scratch, starting anew. In the wilderness, I rescued lost travelers. I gathered and delivered medicinal herbs to the villagers at the foot of the mountain. I drove away nearby mountain monsters and ghosts.\n\nAlthough I had no temple, I performed the duties of a mountain god, protecting the common folk of that region generation after generation. Even now, in that small town, there is still a stone statue of me, and tales of the divine monkey helping people are still passed down locally.\"\n\nZhou Ze wiped his fingernails on his clothes, looking at his badly damaged nails, feeling great pity. Of course, regarding what the monkey said, Zhou Ze merely revealed a sneer.\n\nA divine monkey? A mountain god protecting the villagers? Helping others for joy?\n\nYou're taking 'helping others for joy' a bit too far, aren't you? When someone's husband went out to work, you even went to help comfort the wife left alone in her boudoir?\n\nFurthermore, recalling the image of this fellow masturbating against the wall when he first went upstairs, it was truly difficult to associate it with a divine monkey.\n\n\"Don't put on a show for yourself, only picking out the good parts to tell.\" Zhou Ze raised his hand again, preparing to end this monkey's life.\n\n\"It was them. During my fourth cultivation cycle of reincarnation, they captured my physical body that had just undergone reincarnation. At that time, I was merely a small monkey. Her husband was a lumberjack in the forest at the time, and he fell and injured himself in a ravine. It was I who went to bring him fruits and dew. It was I who led his fellow workers to their camp to rescue him.\n\nBut when he was rescued, he used the logging ropes to tie me up, and said to his fellow workers:\n\n'Surviving a great disaster surely brings future blessings. Upon hearing that monkey brains are extremely beneficial, take them and give them to his wife to taste; it has miraculous effects for infertility!'\"\n\nThe last part, the monkey spoke in classical Chinese, which showed its anger, and also indicated that it was already on its deathbed. Its consciousness was gradually becoming chaotic, and it subconsciously spoke in the way it was most accustomed to.\n\n\"'Open my head, take my marrow, cut my flesh, distribute it for all to consume, saying it is a great tonic!'\"\n\nAs the monkey spoke, its body, which had shrunk to the size of an ordinary monkey, began to tremble. This was a grinding anger, an anger that penetrated deep into its bones!\n\nCultivating for three Jiazi periods, performing good deeds and accumulating virtue, protecting a region, yet on the eve of achieving great cultivation, it was all destroyed. It didn't die at the hands of its own enemies, but at the hands of the very people it saved. For anyone, this would ignite a monstrous hatred.\n\n\"My physical body is destroyed, my Great Dao has collapsed, yet the resentment in my heart is hard to quell!\n\nYesterday's cause, today's effect! My body is already dead and my Dao dissipated; I wish to enter reincarnation, to be reborn into the animal realm, but my heart's resentment is hard to dispel, and my soul cannot enter Hell. Thus, I had to descend the mountain to seek revenge, to resolve this karma, only then can I truly be freed.\"\n\n\"Is that why you violated his wife?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"You are human, I am beast. For humans to eat beasts is only right and proper! But for a beast to repay humans with vengeance, is that intolerable to the Heavenly Dao, or no?\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"Indeed.\"\n\nHe was unwilling to deny it, nor did he want to deny it.\n\nOf course, eating monkey brains was illegal and wrong behavior, but from Zhou Ze's personal emotional inclination, he still couldn't accept this monkey coming down the mountain for revenge and almost causing a death of two lives.\n\nFor instance, if you saw people eating braised pork at a restaurant, you'd think, 'Mmm, delicious!'\n\nBut if you saw a group of pigs gnawing on human flesh in a restaurant, what would you, as a human, feel?\n\nA very selfish stance, a very twisted perspective, but the truth is simply this: people's positions differ, and naturally, their perspectives on things also differ.\n\nMoreover, Zhou Ze felt that no matter what, the child in the pregnant woman's belly was innocent.\n\n\"You're in great pain, aren't you? Let me help you find release. Then, let's see if I can send your soul to Hell.\"\n\n\"Thank…\" The monkey uttered its last word.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernail once again pierced the monkey's body. The monkey's body trembled, then completely lost all signs of life.\n\nBut Zhou Ze searched for a long time, and waited for a long time, yet found no trace of the monkey's departed soul.\n\nThis likely meant that the monkey's soul had been scattered, because its revenge hadn't been completed, and thus its soul was unable to enter Hell.\n\nStanding up, Zhou Ze noticed a faint layer of black mist dissipating around him. It was like a barrier, preventing what happened here from being perceived by the outside world. Otherwise, with the commotion he and the monkey made fighting here, many people would have been attracted over by now.\n\nZhou Ze hoisted the monkey's corpse onto his shoulder, held onto the stairwell, and slowly walked down.\n\nAt the same time, he reminded himself internally to remember today's lesson: he was just a Ghost Catcher, in charge of ghosts. Mountain spirits and monsters of that kind were beyond his scope of work.\n\nUnder the cover of night, in a park on the outskirts of the hospital, Zhou Ze used a shovel left in the gardener's shed to dig a pit for the monkey and buried its body.\n\nThen he simply treated his wounds. After completing all of this, Zhou Ze, feeling a bit weak, leaned against a large tree and sat down.\n\nHe took out his phone, whose screen was shattered but still usable. Zhou Ze sent a message to Dr. Lin:\n\n\"The pregnant woman and her child, were they saved?\"\n\nFive minutes later, Dr. Lin replied:\n\n\"They were saved, mother and child are safe.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and took a deep drag. Immediately, he felt a sharp pain in his lungs and coughed violently.\n\nBut soon, Dr. Lin sent another photo and a line of text.\n\n\"However, the child is deformed, with three legs.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the photo on his phone.\n\nThe small, premature infant lay quietly there, breathing evenly,\n\nbut his lower body had three legs.\n\nThe extra leg resembled a monkey's… tail.\n\n---\n\\* *Lao Zong*: A colloquial, respectful term typically used for a high-ranking officer or boss.\n\\** *Jiazi periods*: A Jiazi (甲子) is a 60-year cycle in the traditional Chinese calendar system. \"Three Jiazi periods\" thus refers to 180 years.",

    "content": "His body felt a little weary, his mind a little lost. He tossed away his cigarette butt, hung his jacket over his shoulder, and, following the guidance of the streetlamps, Zhou Ze walked along the dim yellow path.\n\nHis silhouette was stretched long.\n\nAt the park exit, stood an old man with white hair. The old man wore a crisp, ironed suit, standing ramrod straight and meticulously, like an old white poplar standing firm in the desert.\n\nJust one glance, and you would know the old man was the kind of person who demanded extreme, even abnormal, perfection in his physical appearance and attire.\n\nZhou Ze didn't look at him, but continued on his way.\n\nThe air was filled with the smell of watermelon slush, a little sweet and a little cloying. This smell made Zhou Ze uncomfortable, because watermelon flesh is red, and this would make Zhou Ze recall many unpleasant scenes.\n\n\"Sir, are you feeling very down?\"\n\nThe old man actively followed Zhou Ze's steps, falling slightly behind by half a body length, just right.\n\n\"A little,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe two continued to walk forward, following closely, forming a unique similarity.\n\n\"Sir, is it because of that monkey? Or, for that polluted infant?\" the old man asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer, and continued to walk slowly forward.\n\nWhen he walked all the way to the traffic light intersection, Zhou Ze stopped, waiting for the green light.\n\nThe old man also stopped.\n\n\"On this matter, there's no right or wrong,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"No right or wrong?\" the old man repeated, then asked, \"But everything has two sides, and naturally, right and wrong can be clearly distinguished. The monkey was a good monkey. It even did more good deeds than those so-called good people among humans. You admit this, don't you, sir?\"\n\n\"So, what's your point?\" Zhou Ze pulled out another cigarette, shielded it with his hand against the wind, and lit it. \"I was wrong?\"\n\n\"After several rebirths and rigorous cultivation, in the end, because of the person it saved, all its efforts were wasted. If it were you, sir, how would you feel?\" the old man asked.\n\n\"I'd be very angry,\" Zhou Ze replied bluntly. This didn't require any thought at all.\n\n\"And after anger?\"\n\n\"If I had the chance, I'd kill his whole family,\" Zhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring.\n\n\"Sir, your logic is very sound,\" the old man commented. \"But you prevented its revenge, even after you learned the sequence of events and the truth from its mouth, you still personally put an end to it.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you think what you did was right?\" the old man asked again.\n\n\"I said, on this matter, there's no right or wrong,\" Zhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette. \"Even if we take ten thousand steps back, the child is innocent.\"\n\n\"According to you, if the monkey had only chosen to take revenge on the husband, you would have understood; you likely wouldn't have stopped it, would you, sir?\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent.\n\n\"But the husband killed the monkey and took its brain because he thought his wife eating it would cure her infertility,\" the old man reminded him. \"Therefore, cause and effect, seemingly calculated to be on the monkey and the husband, but the true source, lies with the monkey and that infant.\"\n\n\"Can cause and effect be calculated this way?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Is there no logic in my calculation?\" the old man counter-asked.\n\n\"According to your calculation, one could trace it back to the meteorite impacting the Earth, dinosaurs becoming extinct, new species appearing, then hominids appearing, then humans and monkeys appearing, and only then this tragedy unfolding. Therefore, the cause and effect would have to be attributed to the meteorite.\"\n\n\"That's sophistry, sir.\" The old man's tone seemed unchanged, very calm, as if he were purely discussing a problem with you.\n\n\"I am human,\" Zhou Ze pointed to his head. \"Standing from a human perspective, I don't think I could allow an anomaly to harm humans in a hospital.\"\n\n\"You are not human, you are a ghost,\" the old man reminded him again.\n\n\"This time, it's your turn to use sophistry.\"\n\n\"Heh heh,\" the old man chuckled.\n\nThe light turned green.\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward and walked on, the old man continued to follow.\n\nA young man in tattered clothes,\nan old man in rigorous attire,\nthe two people on the ground left behind only one shadow.\n\n\"In the end, something still went wrong with the child,\" the old man continued to speak in a calm tone that made one want to stab him. \"It seems that at this moment, one can lament: The Dao of Heaven has good retribution, let's see whom it spares?\"\n\n\"I never believe that things adults do wrong should require an infant in swaddling clothes to bear joint responsibility.\"\n\n\"Ancient times had laws of collective punishment, which means they had their reasons for existing,\" the old man said.\n\n\"Now it has been abolished, which means its non-existence is better than its existence.\"\n\n\"Sir, you pity that child, but who pities that monkey?\"\n\n\"You can go to Flower Fruit Mountain and ask its ancestors.\"\n\n\"So, fundamentally, it's still the theory of speciesism supremacy, nothing more than a layer of protective coloration compared to regional discrimination and racial discrimination.\"\n\n\"I have a bread in my hand, this is my dinner for today.\" Zhou Ze opened a hand, indicating he was holding a piece of bread.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then, when I was about to eat this bread, I suddenly remembered that in some impoverished areas on Earth, there are still people who don't have enough to eat, starved to emaciation. So I couldn't bear to eat this bread, and willingly stayed hungry with them, or even starved to death with them.\"\n\n\"Sir, I don't think your irony is very appropriate,\" the old man shook his head. \"Can you consider the monkey a beast? Its actions over these three Jiazi cycles,¹ make it more like a human than most so-called humans.\"\n\n\"Alright, then let's use another example.\n\nI have a luxury car by my side, and expensive red wine and caviar in front of me. I again thought of people on Earth still starving, and I couldn't bear to eat again, and still decided to starve with them, to starve to death with them. If you eat such good things, if you drive such good cars, people will point their fingers at your nose and curse you, cursing that you should donate the money you use for enjoyment to people in impoverished areas.\"\n\nThe old man stopped, as if he were thinking.\n\nZhou Ze didn't stop, and continued to walk forward.\n\nFinally, the old man caught up.\n\n\"I'm still very curious why you stopped it.\"\n\n\"What do you think I should have done?\"\n\n\"Act as if you didn't see it,\" the old man replied. \"You are a soul-reaper, a guardian of the rules of the Underworld in the Human Realm. A referee is respected because of his neutrality; once you act as both a referee and an athlete, the game collapses.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean.\" Zhou Ze stopped, looked at the old man, this old geezer whose clothes were so meticulous that Zhou Ze wanted to go up and wrinkle his suit.\n\n\"The meaning is simple: the two examples you gave earlier were merely to explain that you just made the choice you wanted to make at that time, and the words I just came over and asked were nothing but the noisy babbling of an outsider.\"\n\n\"I thought you didn't understand.\"\n\n\"I understood, you are a good person,\" the old man repeated again. \"You are a good 'human'.\"\n\nFrom the perspective of a 'human', it is indeed so.\n\n\"So, you deliberately came over just to give me a definition?\" Zhou Ze looked at the old man, his ten fingers still burning with pain. \"I didn't know that after picking up that thing, trouble would come so quickly.\"\n\nBefore, the little loli said she was an incandescent lamp in the dark night; now Zhou Ze felt he was an incendiary bomb in the dark night.\n\nThe old man shook his head and said, \"I am not your trouble. In fact, I am a servant left behind by the Master, and you have just inherited the Master's identity plate. And because of this, my seal was lifted. I awakened, and then found you. And incidentally, observed you for a while.\"\n\n\"Picked up a good thing, and then got an old man as a bonus?\"\n\nA smile appeared at the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth,\n\n\"Should I also say:\n'Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river, don't bully a young man for being poor?'²\nAnd by the way, sigh 'how terrifying it is'?\nThat seems more appropriate for the occasion.\"\n\n\"I don't understand, sir,\" the old man said directly.\n\n\"You should read more,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Very well,\" the old man nodded solemnly. \"I have been enlightened.\"\n\nAhead, they encountered a red light again, and the two stopped once more.\n\n\"Sir, since you have inherited the Master's identity plate, you have naturally become my new Master,\" the old man began, and at the same time, he bent down to Zhou Ze, bowing in salute.\n\nZhou Ze stood still, looking at the old man.\n\nToday had been truly eventful;\nhe had picked up an ID, killed a monkey, and even an old man popped up, saying he wanted to recognize him as his Master.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't overjoyed; he just felt it was a bit troublesome. He couldn't clearly see what the purpose of this suddenly appearing old man was.\n\n\"The Master once gave an instruction, for me to tell his successor,\" the old man began again. \"Of course, this sentence is for you, and also for me, this servant.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"If his successor is a good person, then...\"\n\nThe sound of a sharp object piercing a body rang out,\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head in astonishment,\n\nhe saw the old man's hand directly pierce his chest,\n\nso decisive,\n\nso abrupt,\n\nhe didn't even have the slightest mental preparation.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's feet left the ground. The old man raised his arm, and Zhou Ze was also lifted up by him.\n\nUnder the dim yellow streetlamp, Zhou Ze could clearly see his own blood flowing down the old man's arm, staining half of the old man's suit red.\n\n\"The Master said, if his successor is a good person, then kill him, and wait for the next one.\"\n\nThe old man still said these words very calmly;\nhe wasn't killing;\nit was as if he were throwing away trash,\njust like a picky chef selecting his ingredients, directly discarding them and getting new ones if they were slightly unsatisfactory.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, was this inexplicably discarded trash.\n\nBlood flowed continuously. Zhou Ze's ten broken nails grew out, but before Zhou Ze could make his next move, the old man pierced through Zhou Ze's palm and suddenly exerted force.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nZhou Ze felt immense pain coming from all his limbs and bones. Zhou Ze's body also went into a spasm, completely unable to fight back.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir. A minute ago, you might have thought today was your lucky day, because you acquired something you really wanted. I wonder if you noticed the blurry white patches under the name and position fields on the ID. You might have thought that what was hidden under the white patches were the Master's name and position; and indeed, that's true. But it wasn't just those. There were also the names and positions of the eight successors before you.\"\n\nThe old man continued to speak calmly.\n\n\"They... th-they... were all... good people?\"\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth, blood continuously overflowing from the corners of his lips. He felt like a salted fish, hung on a tree branch,\n\nslowly waiting to be air-dried.\n\n\"No, sir, you are the only good person among these nine,\" the old man replied.\n\n\"Then why... why... did they... also... die...\"\n\n\"Because when I asked them if they were a good person, they all felt that answering 'yes' seemed more advantageous.\"\n\nThe old man slightly tilted his head, revealing a hint of helplessness,\n\n\"And then,\n\nthey all died.\"\n\n---\n¹ **Three Jiazi cycles (三甲子):** A Jiazi (甲子) cycle is a 60-year cycle in the traditional Chinese calendar.

    "content": "Zhou Ze remembered clearly what death felt like. He had once been pushed into a crematorium's incinerator to experience the treatment of being incinerated;\n\nAnd beforehand, crematorium staff had even used steel hooks to pierce his stomach to prevent his body from swelling and exploding during cremation.\n\nThat feeling was very similar to his chest being pierced through now.\n\nPain?\n\nOf course, it hurt.\n\nBut when the pain became too intense, you instead felt numb, like after getting a spinal anesthetic for surgery in a hospital; behind the curtain blocking your view, you could probably only feel something rummaging around on your belly.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to resist, but his body had fallen into a deathly stillness of convulsions, and even his eyelids, at this moment, became exceptionally heavy.\n\nNo matter how unwilling, no matter how much he resisted,\n\nhis eyelids,\n\nstill closed.\n\n…………\n\nSlowly opening his eyes, he saw dim lights around him. In front, there was a long marble table, its patterns chaotic yet giving a sense of exquisite refinement.\n\nLowering his head, Zhou Ze found himself sitting on a chair, a Grand Tutor's Chair*, on which he was leaning back. Below his neck, he wore a white neckerchief, but it looked more like a bib tied there to prevent soup stains from dirtying his clothes during a meal.\n\nHis two hands held a silver knife and fork, respectively,\n\nand in front of him was a pristine white plate, on which lay a piece of roasted meat, emitting wisps of steam. It was garnished with lemon and cauliflower.\n\n\"Sir, I've lightly torched the cauliflower with a blowtorch; it gives it a grilled flavor. I hope you'll like it.\"\n\nThe old man's voice came from across Zhou Ze. He was dressed similarly and was cutting a steak, putting pieces into his mouth and chewing.\n\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to eat, asking directly.\n\nWeren't you going to kill me?\n\n\"There was a slight accident.\" The old man picked up the drink beside him and took a small sip.\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\nThe old man placed one hand on the table and pushed the ID card towards Zhou Ze.\n\n\"The identification plaque is damaged to this extent; I hadn't expected it,\" the old man said, then continued to cut a piece of meat and put it into his mouth, savoring it carefully.\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"Therefore, I'm very sorry, but you can't die,\" the old man said, a faint smile on his lips. \"Sir, your luck is truly excellent.\"\n\n\"You're not killing me anymore?\"\n\n\"That's right, sir. Because the identification plaque left by the Master cannot withstand another process of acknowledging a new owner and refreshing. Otherwise, it would simply shatter and become useless.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head, raised his wine glass, and gave a slight toast towards Zhou Ze.\n\n\"So, congratulations, sir. It seems my previous words were mistaken. Today is indeed your lucky day.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the wine glass, looking at the clear red wine color within. He didn't rush to drink, but instead asked:\n\n\"There isn't any strange poison in this wine, is there?\"\n\n\"You jest, sir.\"\n\nJest?\n\nEarlier, you said I was your new master,\n\nAnd then?\n\nOne hand pierced directly through my chest!\n\nWho's jesting now?\n\n\"Sir, please try my cooking. When the old Master was alive, I was responsible for his daily meals. Although many years have passed, I don't think my culinary skills have deteriorated too much.\"\n\n\"No poison in the meat?\" Zhou Ze asked with a smile.\n\n\"Sir, you worry too much. For me, wanting to kill or torment you wouldn't require such trouble.\"\n\nWhat you said makes a lot of sense, there's really no way to refute it.\n\nZhou Ze cut a piece of meat with his knife, brought it to his mouth with his fork, and chewed. He instinctively wanted to vomit, but unexpectedly found the meat melted in his mouth and had an excellent texture.\n\nMost importantly, he felt no nausea whatsoever.\n\n\"Is it delicious?\" the old man asked.\n\n\"It's acceptable.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"If it's delicious, please eat more. As a chef, it's a very happy thing when the dishes you make are liked and eaten a lot.\"\n\nThe old man ate half a plate of meat, put down his knife and fork, and took out a hot towel to wipe his hands.\n\nZhou Ze ate a few more pieces of meat, then asked:\n\n\"What now?\"\n\n\"Sir, you jest again.\" The old man's face once again showed a benevolent smile. \"After the meal, sir, you are free to leave. I will not restrict your freedom.\"\n\n\"It just ends like this?\" Zhou Ze found it somewhat absurd.\n\n\"Yes, it's over,\" the old man affirmed.\n\n\"But I remember you said that Lord Prefect wanted a bad person, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\n\"Just because the identification plaque was damaged, I got an exception?\"\n\nReally, just because of good luck?\n\n\"No, the Lord Prefect's will does not allow for the slightest compromise.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"The answer is within your heart,\" the old man reminded.\n\n\"I really dislike that kind of cryptic conversation style monks use,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old man reached out and patted his own chest. \"Sir, in that regard, I'm the same.\"\n\nZhou Ze's expression suddenly darkened, as if he had thought of something. He immediately lowered his head, pulled open the neckerchief on his neck, revealing the left side of his chest.\n\nThere, it was empty.\n\n\"I've applied the best ointment to your wound, and it will heal in a few days without leaving any scars. I even took the liberty of treating other wounds on your body.\n\nYou don't need to thank me, nor be polite to me.\"\n\nI thank your mother's p*ssy!*\n\n\"My heart? Where's my heart?!\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe old man pointed to the dining plate in front of Zhou Ze, saying pleasantly:\n\n\"You said it tasted good.\"\n\n*Bang!*\n\nZhou Ze slammed the knife and fork in his hands onto the table.\n\nThe old man picked up a cup of tea, rinsed his mouth, spat it out, and then slowly stood up.\n\n\"Without a heart, you'll have fewer worries, and you'll be able to live more comfortably.\n\nA good person, without a conscience, cannot be good anymore, no matter how good he was. Don't you agree?\"\n\nZhou Ze gripped the tablecloth tightly with both hands, raising his head to stare at the old man.\n\n\"You'd better kill me now.\"\n\nThe old man smiled slightly, \"So, sir, are you going to say it again now: 'Don't bully a young man for being poor'?\"\n\nThen, the old man gently patted his chest, drew a sharp breath, and feigned:\n\n\"How truly terrifying.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Sir, you won't have a chance to seek revenge on me. My lifespan has long since reached its end. Once you leave this room, I will also dissipate.\"\n\n\"Will you go to hell?\"\n\n\"Hell, there's no place for me,\" the old man replied. \"It's the final end.\"\n\nImmediately, the old man pointed to the dining plate in front of Zhou Ze again.\n\n\"Sir, would you like me to pack it for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, a hollow feeling in his chest. The large hole where the wound was, was even more shocking to behold. But he wasn't dead. More precisely, Xu Le's body wasn't dead, and he didn't even feel the slightest bit of pain.\n\nThe wound, will it heal in a few days?\n\nPicking up the ID card from the table, Zhou Ze walked towards the door, but stopped halfway and asked:\n\n\"I'm very curious, who exactly is that Lord Prefect?\"\n\n\"Ever since the Lord Prefect was deceived by that Bodhisattva who ran off to hell, he no longer wishes to have his name mentioned.\"\n\nHe didn't get an answer, but Zhou Ze was unwilling to linger there any longer. Pushing open the door in front of him, he walked out. When he looked back, he found the door he had just come out of was gone.\n\nBehind him, there was a desolate graveyard.\n\n…………\n\nInside the house, the old man quietly cleared the tableware and swept the room clean again.\n\nThen, he spread his hand and patted the table.\n\n\"Come out.\"\n\nA small, nimble golden snub-nosed monkey** emerged from who knew where, jumped onto the table, and scratched its ears and cheeks at the old man, looking very cute.\n\nHowever, the golden snub-nosed monkey's body was somewhat ethereal, clearly not a real existence.\n\n\"Although it's said that every injustice has its perpetrator, and every debt has its debtor***, what you did this time was too much. Even if the final consequence fell upon that infant, it shouldn't have been the target of your revenge.\n\nIf one always pursues karma and submits to karma, and acts accordingly, then why should you, little beast, pursue any Great Dao****?\n\nEating and drinking, birth, aging, sickness, and death – isn't that the most compliant with karma?\"\n\nThe golden snub-nosed monkey shook its head, then nodded.\n\n\"Don't blame me for confiscating the soul that was attached to that infant. Your three *jiazi* cycles of merit***** can be considered compensation for that child. Even if he's disabled now, he'll be able to have smooth sailing in the future because of this, and even after surgery, he can become a normal person.\n\nDon't feel you've been wronged. Let this matter end here. Later, I will give you a new physical body. You may leave freely, whether to cultivate again or to play in the mountains and forests from now on. Just don't do what you did today again.\n\nEven humans cultivating the Dao face the five ailments and three deficiencies******, let alone you, a small beast. Just consider this a tribulation on your path of cultivation.\"\n\nHaving said that,\n\nthe old man pushed open the door to the inner room.\n\nThis small room had no other furnishings, only an ink wash painting hanging on the wall.\n\nIn the painting,\n\nthere was a majestic mountain,\n\nwhere creation gathered divine beauty, and yin and yang divided dawn from dusk!\n\nA man wearing a purple crown and a yellow robe stood atop the mountain peak.\n\nThe painting had yellowed,\n\nand the person in the painting had long since passed away,\n\nOnly the majestic mountain in the painting still stood there, towering over all other mountains.\n\n\"Lord Prefect, your humble servant has completed what you commanded.\"\n\nThe old man knelt before the painting.\n\nThe scene of their farewell from days past reappeared in his mind:\n\n…………\n\n\"You old geezer, die later, hold on a bit longer. Help this Lord keep an eye on whose hands this identification plaque eventually falls into. If it's a good person, just slaughter him for me and find someone else!\n\nThis Lord was simply led astray by those monks, believing their endless nonsense about 'hell not emptying, I swear not to become a Buddha'*******. My lifetime of renown is completely lost!\n\nThe one holding this Lord's identification plaque must absolutely not be a good person again, otherwise this Lord will die with his eyes open!\"\n\n\"Master, what defines a good person, and what defines a bad person?\n\nA good person might do bad things, and a bad person might do good things.\n\nThis old servant is foolish and fears ruining the Lord Prefect's instructions regarding the distinction between good and bad.\"\n\n\"Damn it!******** Where's all this convoluted nonsense and miscellaneous excuses? If you think he's not a bad person, just kill him.\"\n\n\"Yes, this old servant respectfully obeys your decree.\"\n\n…………\n\n\"He's a good person?\"\n\nIn the inner room, the old man, still kneeling, slowly raised his head and murmured to the painting:\n\n\"He is indeed a 'good' person,\n\nbut in my eyes,\n\nhe is a 'bad' person.\"\n\nAs the old man spoke, his face began to darken, and yellow fur started to grow on his face and hands.\n\nHis face began to distort, transforming into a hairy face with a prominent, thundering mouth!*********\n\nThis was an old ape!\n\nBorn in the wilderness of Mount Tai, his lifelong ambition was to carry that Mount Tai,\n\nIn ancient words, it was called: Mountain-Carrying Ape!\n\n\"My disciples and grand-disciples,********** who cultivated for three *jiazi* cycles, were happy to help others, diligent in their cultivation, yet met with such great disaster and suffering!\n\nHe, relying on his human perspective, disregarded everything and simply went up and killed it!\n\nWhy?!\n\nWhy?!\n\nJust because he's human, because he was human in his lifetime?!\n\nSo, any non-human, as long as it threatens humans, regardless of right or wrong, regardless of truth or falsehood,\n\nshould be killed? Should die?\"\n\nThe old man sat down cross-legged.\n\nAnd finally murmured:\n\n\"From a human's perspective, he is a good person.\n\nFrom the monkey clan's perspective, this old servant views him as a bad person.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nIn the end,\n\nI actually failed to let him die because of this.\n\nLord Prefect,\n\nIs this what you meant?\n\nLord Prefect,\n\nThis old servant is coming to follow you. For so many years, without this old servant serving and cooking for you, you must have been unaccustomed, right?\"\n\nThe old man lost his life force,\n\nThe ape's body sat there like that,\n\nAt this moment, the golden snub-nosed monkey in its soul state ran out, first knelt and kowtowed to the old man's remains, then burrowed into the old man's skin.\n\nA moment later,\n\nfrom beneath the old man's clothes,\n\na tiny monkey, about the size of a palm, crawled out,\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak............\"\n\nThe little monkey chirped a few times in a row, then ran out.\n\n---\n*   **Grand Tutor's Chair (太師椅, Tàishīyǐ)**: A type of traditional Chinese armchair, often elaborate and associated with high-ranking officials.\n*   **I thank your mother's p*ssy!

    "content": "When he took a taxi back to the bookstore, it was already midnight. The bookstore door was still open, and there were quite a few people inside.\n\nZhou Ze remembered Xu Qinglang had called him earlier to say business was very good tonight, and it indeed seemed so; at this hour, there were surprisingly still customers.\n\nPushing open the glass door, to Zhou Ze's slight disappointment, the more than ten people sitting in the store were all living people.\n\nDirector Zhao's matter last time was an exception. This time, it couldn't possibly be that all ten-plus people were exceptions, could it?\n\nEven during the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, common customs—oh no, ghost customs—weren't this simple.\n\nThey sat in a circle, with one person standing in the middle, telling a story. Everyone else was listening intently; it seemed to be a suspenseful horror story. The narrator also used intonation and some body language, trying their best to create an atmosphere.\n\nBai Yingying was sitting behind the counter, playing on her phone.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze returned, Bai Yingying proactively stood up and poured Zhou Ze a glass of water.\n\nZhou Ze sat down, subconsciously reaching out to cover his chest area. Although it was covered by clothes, at least for now, that area was empty.\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong?\" Bai Yingying asked, somewhat strangely.\n\n\"Huh?\" Zhou Ze looked at Bai Yingying.\n\n\"I just feel like you're somehow different. You weren't like this when you left this afternoon.\"\n\nIt must be said, the female corpse was still very sensitive.\n\n\"It's nothing.\" Zhou Ze didn't want to talk right now.\n\n\"Since you're back, can I go next door to play games?\" Bai Yingying pleaded.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Boss is the best.\"\n\nBai Yingying went to the noodle shop next door. Soon, Xu Qinglang walked into the bookstore from the noodle shop, came to the counter, offered Zhou Ze a cigarette, and asked:\n\n\"Is this some kind of tea party?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn't know.\n\n\"Hey, it sounds like they're telling ghost stories.\" Xu Qinglang became interested and even found a plastic stool to sit down with them.\n\nThe person in the middle of the circle was telling a story of a ghost baby's revenge. It was full of twists and turns, the storytelling was indeed good, and the people around were listening very attentively.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze also understood. This must be a \"club,\" an organization gathered together due to a common interest, similar to a book club or cycling club.\n\nAfter the last story finished, a man leading the group took out a large white paper with some things drawn on it, and then pulled out several pens.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit far away and couldn't see clearly. Xu Qinglang, however, turned his head and mouthed something to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Pen Fairy.\"\n\nPen Fairy is a type of ghost-summoning game, carrying a very mysterious aura. It is said that playing this game can easily lead to misfortune and invite possession by deceased souls.\n\nThese people were all very excited. Everyone reached out and jointly held the long pen. A man wearing a yellow tweed coat and black-framed glasses seemed to be the leader. After everyone was ready, he spoke very devoutly:\n\n\"Pen Fairy, Pen Fairy, where are you? Pen Fairy, Pen Fairy, where are you?\"\n\nThe pen still didn't move, but the bookstore suddenly fell silent.\n\nThe black-framed man continued:\n\n\"Pen Fairy, Pen Fairy, will we encounter ghosts tonight?\"\n\nTen seconds after the words fell,\n\nThe long pen held by everyone began to move slowly.\n\nEveryone held their breath.\n\nActually, when many people grasp a pen together, as long as the pen tip is smooth enough, it's naturally easy for it to slide. If one of them slightly plays a trick, it becomes even simpler.\n\n\"Swish!\"\n\nThe pen tip suddenly flickered,\n\ndirectly pointing horizontally towards where Zhou Ze was sitting.\n\nXu Qinglang slightly opened his mouth. A fluke?\n\nZhou Ze still sat steadily behind the counter, watching the situation with half-closed eyes.\n\nDue to the movement of the pen tip, most people's gaze turned towards Zhou Ze's direction.\n\n\"Yes!\" the black-framed man said, pointing at the area where the pen tip was.\n\nThere were two areas, \"Yes\" and \"No\"; at this moment, the pen tip was precisely within the \"Yes\" area.\n\n\"Alright, pack your things, we'll set off together later. Remember, the activity will be half an hour. Everyone's phone is charged, right? Later, everyone must record video for at least twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Got it.\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\nThe rest of the people tidied up their belongings and left the bookstore. The black-framed man, however, walked to Zhou Ze's counter and said apologetically:\n\n\"Excuse me, Boss, we're from the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association. We do supernatural exploration when we have nothing to do. We didn't scare you, did we?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Then, Boss, you're really brave. When that young lady was here just now, I asked if we could play Pen Fairy here, and she permitted it. But then you returned, and I was really worried you'd blame us. This is for tea and water, Boss, please accept it.\"\n\nThe man handed over six hundred yuan.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and asked, \"Where are you going later?\"\n\n\"It's the building above your store. There haven't been any businesses here for a long time, have there? A while ago, there was an arson case, and several people were burned to death. We plan to try our luck there tonight.\"\n\n\"You want to see ghosts that much?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but people are always curious about the unknown, aren't they? Actually, everyone gathers together with the mindset of seeking thrills.\n\nIn terms of everyone's usual social circles, it's hard to find like-minded people around. Our club also provides an opportunity for everyone to communicate.\n\nMoreover, I've already arranged things in advance for tonight. I already had people set up things in advance at the cinema that was burned down before, during the day. Tonight, Mr. Chen from our club will confess his feelings to Miss Liu.\"\n\n\"Confess?\"\n\n\"That's right. Actually, everyone else knows about tonight's matter; only Miss Liu doesn't know. Our club has been established for five years, everyone's relationships are good, so everyone is very willing to help.\"\n\n\"Are you Japanese?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at the black-framed man.\n\n\"Yes, I'm considered an overseas Chinese who repatriated from Japan five years ago. These kinds of hobby clubs are very common in Japan. After returning, I found that everyone was too introverted, so basically, I organize all the daily book clubs or haunted house exploration activities.\"\n\nThe man slapped his forehead and handed over his business card,\n\n\"My Chinese name is Cui Yilang. Please guide me.\" [1]\n\nZhou Ze took the business card from his hand.\n\n\"Then we'll go organize the activity now. Thank you again, Boss, for your hospitality.\"\n\nCui Yilang walked out of the bookstore. Xu Qinglang, who had been standing silently by the side, immediately burst into loud laughter, clutching his stomach:\n\n\"Hahaha, I was holding it in so hard, they really encountered ghosts this time.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was laughing, and then he noticed Zhou Ze wasn't laughing. He reached out and lightly hit Zhou Ze's chest, and asked:\n\n\"Isn't it funny?\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately bent down, covering the spot on his chest that had just been hit with one hand.\n\n\"This... are you alright? I didn't use much strength, did I?\"\n\n\"I just used my little fist to pound your chest.\" [2]\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze reached out, gesturing for Xu Qinglang not to come closer, and at the same time said, \"I just laughed so hard my chest hurts.\"\n\n\"That exaggerated?\" Xu Qinglang pursed his lips. \"Are you hungry? I'll make you... a bowl of egg fried rice?\"\n\n\"Not hungry, I've eaten.\"\n\n\"You ate outside?\" Xu Qinglang asked, somewhat curious. \"Aren't you unaccustomed to outside food?\"\n\n\"That thing, it was delicious.\"\n\n\"What kind of dish was it? If you can eat it, I'll go buy some back tomorrow and cook it for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nA person only has one heart.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't produce a whole basket of them for Xu Qinglang to \"fry, deep-fry, boil, or steam.\"\n\n\"Then what do you want to eat recently?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Water spinach, maybe.\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang and said very seriously, \"I suddenly really want to eat that recently.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll go get some stock tomorrow.\"\n\nJust then, the lights in the bookstore suddenly went out.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!! It's the final circle! It's the destined circle!!!!\n\nI was about to get a chicken dinner! My Groza had level 3 armor, a level 3 helmet, and a 15x scope!\"\n\nBai Yingying rushed out of the noodle shop, standing outside and wailing loudly.\n\nZhou Ze felt that when she was drowned in a pig cage in the past [3], she probably didn't scream as intensely as she was now.\n\nThe power was out.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang also walked outside.\n\nXu Qinglang made a call, then hung up the phone and said helplessly:\n\n\"Son of a bitch, they said someone would only come for inspection tomorrow. Old Zhou, our place here is really going downhill. Even when the power goes out, people are too lazy to come directly to check. Now it's become a place for hobbyists to explore haunted houses.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed towards the windows of the tall building above their heads, \"How did they even think of it, to confess in that cinema where people died?\"\n\n\"It's very romantic. In a horrifying environment and atmosphere, coupled with the sudden arrival of love, this sense of contrast is enough to captivate those who enjoy this sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Why does the way you speak today give people a strange feeling?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You really look like you've been hollowed out. Did you take that step with your wife today?\" Xu Qinglang asked cautiously.\n\n\"You're thinking too much.\"\n\nBut the word \"hollowed out\" made Zhou Ze's eyelids tremble slightly. Xu Qinglang caught this detail.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head and looked up.\n\n\"Hey,\n\nlooking at the sky won't help.\n\nAre you feeling guilty?\n\nDid I really hit the nail on the head?\"\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze didn't reply, Xu Qinglang also raised his head,\n\nlooking up at the sky.\n\nThen,\n\nthe two of them saw a person dressed in white seemingly standing at the glass window on the fifth floor.\n\nDue to the power outage, there was no light around, but the moon was bright tonight, and the color of the person's clothes was easy to distinguish in the night.\n\n\"Don't tell me they even hired someone to pretend to be a ghost to enhance the atmosphere?\" Xu Qinglang blew out a smoke ring. \"They're really taking it to the extre...\"\n\nXu Qinglang stopped speaking,\n\nbecause he saw the white figure above fall down,\n\nvery quickly,\n\nand landed directly less than ten meters from him and Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nA heavy thud was heard,\n\na person fell face up onto the ground, motionless. Fresh blood slowly spread out from beneath her.\n\nZhou Ze felt a chill on his face,\n\nsome blood spatters had landed on his cheek.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately ran over to check on the fallen person's condition,\n\nwhile Zhou Ze, however, reached into his pocket for a tissue, intending to first wipe off the bloodstains from his face.\n\nSomeone died... Need to save someone... Need to check the situation...\n\nA look of struggle appeared in Zhou Ze's eyes,\n\nbut his hand still tremblingly pulled out the tissue,\n\nslowly and carefully wiping away those few drops of blood.\n\n\"Hey, come over quickly and see if there's any chance of saving them!\" Xu Qinglang looked up and shouted at Zhou Ze. Then, when he saw Zhou Ze actually standing there, not moving a single step, wiping his face, he directly yelled:\n\n\"Do you have any conscience left, wiping your face at a time like this!\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment.\n\nThat's right,\n\nMy heart,\n\nit's gone...\n***\n[1] \"Please guide me\": A polite, humble phrase commonly used in East Asian cultures when introducing oneself, implying a request for future assistance or guidance.\n[2] \"I just used my little fist to pound your chest\": A direct translation of a popular Chinese internet meme (小拳拳捶你胸口, _xiǎo quánquán chuí nǐ xiōngkǒu_), typically used playfully to express feigned anger or cuteness.\n[3] \"drowned in a pig cage\": A historical method of execution in China, often used for women accused of adultery, where they were placed in a bamboo cage and thrown into water.",

    "content": "「Alright, the statement is done. You can go now.」\n\nA young police officer closed his notebook and smiled faintly at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, stood up, and prepared to leave.\n\nJust then, the middle-aged police officer who had been sitting beside the young officer, accompanying the statement-taking, suddenly spoke up:\n\n「Mr. Xu, your bookstore is open there, is business good?」\n\n「Not really.」 Zhou Ze answered honestly.\n\nMany people had asked him this question; they were asking about business for the living, so Zhou Ze naturally answered in terms of business for the living.\n\n「Then why do you still choose to keep that shop open there?」 the middle-aged police officer asked.\n\n「I'm a live-in son-in-law. My in-laws are very wealthy, they don't lack money. I'm just passing the time.」\n\nThe middle-aged police officer paused, then nodded, and gestured with his hand: 「You may leave now. If there's anything else we need to consult you about, we will notify you.」\n\n「My pleasure.」\n\nZhou Ze left the interrogation room.\n\nThe young police officer twirled the pen in his hand and said, 「Captain Sun, this guy is quite interesting.」\n\nYes, to openly admit to marrying into a wealthy family and frankly state that he was just loafing around and freeloading, indeed required a lot of courage.\n\n「Let's go check on the interrogations elsewhere.」 The middle-aged police officer stood up and glanced once more at Zhou Ze's departing back. He always felt that the young man who had been sitting in front of him gave him a prickling sensation on his back.\n\nDuring an interrogation, the police officer should be the cobra, and the interrogated subject in front of them the prey. The venomous snake should break through the opponent's defenses as quickly, accurately, and ruthlessly as possible to uncover the truth.\n\nBut just now, he had the illusion that he, the cobra, was, in the other party's eyes, merely a display item dancing to the sound of a flute in an Indian street performer's basket.\n\nThe other party, it seemed, didn't care about this at all.\n\n…………\n\n「Out already?」 Xu Qinglang had just finished his statement and walked out too. 「What bad luck, having to run to the police station in the middle of the night just to give a statement.\n\nAlso, that young officer was so annoying, asking me my gender three times. Is there something wrong with his brain? Can't he tell my gender?」\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang,\n\nthinking to himself: *Don't you have any self-awareness about how you look?*\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were both shop owners, and having personally witnessed the fall, they needed to give a statement, but there was basically nothing else for them. The other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association, however, were considered key suspects by the police, which was only natural.\n\n「By the way, who do you think the murderer is?」 Xu Qinglang asked, smoking a cigarette.\n\nBy this time, the sun was about to rise; it was already morning.\n\n「That's not our concern. The police will investigate and solve the case,」 Zhou Ze said calmly.\n\n「Hey, don't be so negative, alright?\n\nDidn't you watch Sherlock Holmes or Detective Conan when you were little?」\n\nEveryone has at least a little detective dream and a detective plot in their heart, right?\n\nThat feeling of peeling back layers of fog to find the truth, finally spreading one's hands dramatically like Magician Liu Qian, and ostentatiously shouting, 「Now is the moment to witness a miracle,」\n\ncould definitely hit many people's G-spot.\n\n「I'm not interested in people.」\n\n「Still sticking to ghosts, huh?」 Xu Qinglang said sarcastically.\n\n「Yes, ghosts.」 Zhou Ze pulled out his phone to hail a taxi, and at the same time said, 「Do you remember what color clothes the female victim was wearing when she jumped?」\n\n「White.」\n\n「And after she fell?」\n\n「Red, of course.」 Xu Qinglang shrugged. 「It seemed to be stained red with blood. Oh, how pitiful.」\n\n「When she landed, she was originally wearing a red skirt,」 Zhou Ze reminded him. 「Don't use the 'stained red with blood' routine to lull yourself.」\n\nXu Qinglang nodded silently, then reached up to touch the tip of his nose, and said, 「You mean, there's some secret behind this incident, not just a simple accident or murder?」\n\n「I don't know, but I very much hope that's the reason. Previously, the ghosts I've encountered that could give someone a cold were already extremely powerful. If I can really encounter one that can cause accidents resulting in death, it would be a huge harvest.」\n\nThis kind of ghost, one could count for dozens, right?\n\nThe performance points for sending it to hell could also be one for ten, or even more, right?\n\n「Aren't you overthinking it? By the way, speaking of that, I forgot. I didn't tell the police that the clothes were white at first.」 Xu Qinglang clapped his hands and said, 「Maybe the key to solving the case lies in the change of clothing color. The murderer must have devised some extremely clever...」\n\n「Are you possessed by Agatha Christie or Conan Doyle?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「No.」 Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze mournfully. 「Old Zhou, I've noticed you're becoming more and more dull. You used to at least play along a bit.」\n\n「Not in the mood.」\n\n「So we're going back now?」\n\n「Yes.」\n\n「To catch ghosts?」\n\n「To play the Pen Spirit game.」\n\n「You're so childish.」\n\n「Have you heard of... entrapment?」\n\n………………\n\nThe bookstore wasn't sealed off, but the perimeter outside was cordoned with a lot of police tape, and many police officers were circling, searching for clues.\n\nThis way, the bookstore, which already had little business with the living, became even quieter.\n\nZhou Ze had Bai Yingying buy a set of Pen Spirit game equipment, searching directly on Taobao for sellers in Tongcheng, then had Bai Yingying take a taxi to pick up the goods there.\n\nThe paper was spread out,\n\na pile of things, whether useful or not, laid out to one side.\n\nXu Qinglang squatted nearby, watching Zhou Ze busy himself, and said with some helplessness, 「Actually, I have a few methods for summoning spirits that I feel would be more effective than this game.」\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and said, 「It's not the same.」\n\n「What's different?」\n\n「Last night, I didn't sense anything coming.」 Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. 「Did you sense it?」\n\n「Did something come last night?」\n\nXu Qinglang recalled the scene of the long pen sliding towards Zhou Ze when that group was playing the Pen Spirit game last night.\n\n「That was just a coincidence, wasn't it? Didn't that overseas Chinese guy say that their activity last night was just a prelude to a confession? So, someone must have deliberately pushed the pen to point to the location behind you, which is that building, not actually pointing at you.」\n\n「Very good analysis.」 Zhou Ze reached out, lifted the paper on the floor, and then rubbed his fingernail on the tile, saying, 「Was this also deliberate?」\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes widened instantly.\n\nOn the tiled floor, there was actually a groove less than half a meter long, which one might not even notice if standing.\n\nZhou Ze took out a pen, placed its tip in the groove, and slid it along the direction. Both he and Xu Qinglang slowly turned in that direction.\n\nThen,\n\nthe location pointed by the pen,\n\nwas Bai Yingying, who was currently playing King of Glory behind the counter. Zhou Ze had been sitting there last night.\n\nZhou Ze dropped the pen and looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\nMaking a small groove on a tile, that difficulty was extraordinary.\n\nXu Qinglang said, somewhat incredulously, 「No way. Did something really get summoned last night? How come neither you nor I saw it?」\n\n「When Director Zhao came over last time, did we realize he was already dead?\n\nWhen the Faceless Woman came disguised last time, did we figure out her true identity?」\n\n「This...」 Xu Qinglang trailed off.\n\nZhou Ze silently spread out the paper again, then picked up the pen. 「You say, with my identity, would I be unable to summon a Pen Spirit?」\n\nZhou Ze, strictly speaking, was an Underworld Emissary, different from the members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association from last night.\n\n「I don't know, but what I want to know is, did you notice something was off last night when you were sitting there watching the show?」 Xu Qinglang asked, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded,\n\n「Although I didn't feel any special fluctuations and didn't see anything I shouldn't have, when they pushed that pen in my direction, I felt a flutter in my heart, like something was staring at me.」\n\n「Then why didn't you tell them beforehand!」\n\nXu Qinglang grabbed Zhou Ze's collar directly.\n\n「You sensed something was off, something that even made *you* feel a flutter!\n\nWhen they said they were going to play that damn adventure game or confession game in the building behind, why didn't you stop them and warn them!」\n\nZhou Ze reached out, not to push away Xu Qinglang's hand on him, but to wipe off the saliva that Xu Qinglang had splattered on his face while yelling. Afterwards, he looked at Xu Qinglang:\n\n「What does that have to do with me?」\n\nYes,\n\nWhat does that have to do with me?\n\nReleasing Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang took two steps back. He suddenly felt that the person in front of him was somewhat unfamiliar.\n\n「They were patrons in my shop. According to business regulations, I naturally have an obligation to ensure their safety when they are reading or holding tea parties in my shop.\n\nBut since they had already left my shop, what does what happened next have to do with me?」\n\n「You weren't like this before,」 Xu Qinglang murmured.\n\n「What needs to be done now isn't to sigh over the past, nor to lament how things and people are no longer the same. Rather, it's to find that hidden thing and send it to hell.」\n\n「You're passionate about this?」\n\n「These are performance points. Didn't you always mock me for having no goals in life before?」\n\n「You...」 Xu Qinglang licked his lips. 「Fine, you can investigate slowly. I'm not playing along anymore.」\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and stormed out of the bookstore.\n\nBai Yingying walked out with a cup of tea at this moment, saying somewhat surprised:\n\n「Boss, did you and Pretty Boy Xu have a fight?」\n\nZhou Ze didn't reply, but silently squatted down, continuing to look at the groove and the Pen Spirit drawing in front of him.\n\n「Boss, then I'm going to play my game now.」 Bai Yingying placed the tea next to Zhou Ze, stuck out her tongue, and ran to the next-door shop.\n\nShe didn't notice that Zhou Ze, squatting on the ground and looking at the Pen Spirit drawing, was continuously breaking out in a cold sweat on his forehead, while one hand was clutching tightly at his left chest.\n\nDamn it,\n\nI must find that guy as soon as possible,\n\notherwise, more people will die,\n\nDamn it,\n\nWhy does it hurt so much!\n\nWhen Bai Yingying walked into the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang was sitting there smoking. Seeing her enter, Xu Qinglang said directly:\n\n「Has your boss been acting strangely these past two days?」\n\n「I actually think he's become normal,」 Bai Yingying sat down and opened her computer.\n\n「Normal?」 Xu Qinglang scoffed twice. 「You didn't see someone fall to their death right in front of us yesterday, and he just stood there wiping his face with a tissue!」\n\n「He fell to his death directly, didn't he? If he didn't wipe his face, would that have saved him?」\n\nBai Yingying entered the game disdainfully. 「He was an experienced doctor in his previous life. He could tell if someone could be saved at a glance. Instead of running over and making a fuss uselessly, it's better to wipe his face clean first.」\n\n「Hey, I say, you're actually taking his side? Are you two even human?!」\n\n「The two of us genuinely aren't human.」\n\n「Thud!」\n\nJust then,\n\nthe computer screen suddenly flickered, then went black.\n\nAnother power outage.\n\n「Clatter clatter clatter clatter!」\n\nBai Yingying furiously pounded the keyboard, 「I just landed with a 98K!」\n\nXu Qinglang, who had been sitting there smoking, immediately ran out of the shop.\n\nHe looked up,\n\ngazing at the sky.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nby a fifth-floor window,\n\na man in white stood.\n\nMany police officers nearby were frantically calling and shouting into their walkie-talkies for their colleagues inside the building to quickly go and stop him. At the same time, a middle-aged police chief roared:\n\n「How did someone get up to the crime scene? What are you all doing?」\n\n「Thud!」\n\nA dull and familiar thud as something hit the ground,\n\nXu Qinglang stood rooted to the spot,\n\nstaring blankly as the person fell from the sky.\n\nEverything,\n\nseemed exactly the same as last night.\n\nHe instinctively closed his eyes.\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nhuman lives were dropping like dumplings into boiling water,\n\none after another,\n\nworthless.",

    "content": "Hearing the clamor of the crowd outside, Zhou Ze, who had been squatting there, sat down dejectedly on the ground. The tiled floor was a bit cold, but what was colder was his heart.\n\nOh, he forgot. He didn't have a heart anymore.\n\nLifting his shirt, Zhou Ze found that the place where his heart had been scooped out had recovered, completely restored in just one night.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze wonder if he had fallen under the opponent's illusion, and if his heart was actually still there.\n\nBecause he could feel a heartbeat; his body still retained its vitality and showed no problems.\n\nBut it seemed that some emotion had been taken away.\n\nSome of his instinctive reactions were also marked with a 'forbidden' sign, as if an invisible wall had trapped him.\n\nHis past self would have rushed to the deceased's side just like Xu Qinglang, even if his first reaction determined the deceased was definitely dead. But his original self should have reacted that way.\n\nJust now, for example, when Xu Qinglang reprimanded him, he retorted, \"What does that have to do with me?\"\n\nActually, given his state last night, first battling that monkey, then being pulled to a dining table by that inexplicable old man to taste a unique meal, he was already a bit dazed.\n\nEven if he sensed something when those people were playing the spirit-writing game, he couldn't have made any clear reaction.\n\nLast night, he was like a frightened bird, seeing enemies in every bush; any so-called \"stirring\" felt ambiguous.\n\nOf course, these were all excuses. Zhou Ze now clearly felt as if he were undergoing \"dental correction\"—he could still eat and drink, but he was always subject to certain restrictions, and he just felt uncomfortable.\n\nPeople are like this: no matter how great the misfortune or oppression you encounter, as long as there is still hope before you, you can always cling to it desperately and continue to take your steps forward.\n\nIt was like this for Zhou Ze in the orphanage, like this for Zhou Ze in the hospital, and even now, it's still like this for him.\n\nTo put it nicely, it's resilience. To put it bluntly, it's better to live a wretched life than to die with honor.\n\nHe propped himself up with his hands, raised his head, and let out a long breath. He hadn't been quick enough. He had kept telling himself to find that thing early, then grab it, throw it into hell, and earn performance points. This would definitely be a fat chunk of performance points.\n\nBut had he not clearly known that until that thing was found, if one person died, there would surely be a second and a third?\n\nOnce a ghost truly kills, it only becomes crazier. For a ghost, a sudden realization of repentance means vanishing into thin air.\n\nTherefore, people would continuously end their lives inexplicably in this manner.\n\nBut Zhou Ze couldn't think that way, couldn't make that a source of anxiety, otherwise the gripping pain in his chest would make him wish he were dead.\n\nJust as the old man had said at the dining table: a person, once without a conscience, could never be truly good.\n\nJust then, his gaze fixed blankly upwards. He saw what looked like a faint black line on the ceiling.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze's body trembled. He found it. He found that thing.\n\nIt hadn't come in at all. It wasn't in this bookstore last night. It was above, its gaze looking down, observing everything here!\n\nIt even extended its hand, influencing the tip of the pen, and in this way, little by little, joined in the game.\n\nThis was an inconceivable method, one that surpassed Zhou Ze's understanding.\n\n\"Now finally no one else has to die!\"\n\n\"Hiss... it hurts...\"\n\nZhou Ze, who had just stood up, had to bend down and squat again.\n\n\"Now the performance points can finally be earned.\"\n\nAlright, it doesn't hurt anymore. F*ck!\n\n***\n\n\"The deceased is Chen Yinong,\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze, who had just walked out, while chewing betel nut.\n\n\"The guy who was going to confess last night?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, him. I just leaned in and listened to some things next to the police. He should have just finished giving his statement. Who knew he'd appear here right after leaving the police station and jump down?\"\n\nThe police had not identified any specific suspects, so after Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang finished their statements, the others were also allowed to leave after the investigation concluded. The only restriction was that they were not allowed to leave Tongcheng during this period.\n\n\"So he committed suicide for love right after returning from the police station?\" Zhou Ze sighed, \"What a truly terrifying wedding.\"\n\n\"Hey, can't you be a little more virtuous with your words? The person is already dead,\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Virtue? Do you need virtue? I still have some hell money here. If you need it, you can burn some,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"Who invented this idiotic method of accumulating virtue by burning hell money? Do you think burning hell money can make you accumulate virtue and solve all problems?\"\n\n\"That sounds like you're saying money is the root of all evil. Then why don't you sell your twenty-something apartments and donate them to Project Hope?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Come with me to a place,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the tall building on the west side and said, \"There.\"\n\n***\n\nThis commercial center had several tall buildings, all connected by passages. Of course, with the abandonment of this commercial center, the businesses in these tall buildings had long since moved out.\n\nThis was one manifestation of urban overdevelopment, where the construction of skyscrapers exceeded people's daily needs, often resulting in these enormous 'ghost buildings,' also a waste of resources.\n\nThe elevators had stopped operating, so Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang could only take the stairs up.\n\n\"Hey, those two people jumped from the opposite side,\" Xu Qinglang reminded him. \"It was right above your store and mine. Why are you coming here?\"\n\nThe two of them were currently located west of Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang's stores, nearly a hundred meters away from where the consecutive suicides had occurred.\n\n\"You're also a Mystic Cultivator. So, what made you, an insider, mistakenly believe that ghosts need to stand in front of someone and stab them with a knife to kill them, just like living people?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Then how do you deduce that thing is here?\"\n\n\"The groove on the tile.\"\n\nThe two had already ascended to the fourth floor. Zhou Ze chose a spot directly opposite his store, at the shortest distance, then gently slid his index finger in front of him.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"If you're just going to be a curious baby asking 'why' next to me, I suggest you go act in a suspense drama, because they always need an idiot assistant standing next to the protagonist, constantly asking 'why' to set the stage for the protagonist to show off.\"\n\n\"Damn it, your words are getting more and more sarcastic,\" Xu Qinglang complained.\n\n\"Because I've always treated you like a brother, not a woman.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder.\n\n\"Then you don't seem very gentle with Bai Yingying either.\"\n\nZhou Ze made the index finger sliding motion again, then said, \"Actually, this should be a parallel line. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"You mean when those people played the spirit-writing game last night, they really summoned something, but that thing didn't get close. Instead, it stood roughly where we are now, and used its finger to control the pen's movement, pointing at you?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Zhou Ze showed a faint smile. \"So, that one was very bold. The question those hobby association members asked last night was whether they could successfully see a ghost tonight, and then the pen tip was manipulated to point at me. It didn't mind offending me, or even killing right next to me.\"\n\n\"That arrogant?\"\n\n\"No, in my eyes, it means its value is greater, and the performance points gained after sending it in will be more significant. This is a big fish, a big fish that doesn't even put a ghost messenger in its eyes.\"\n\n\"Won't that be very dangerous?\" Xu Qinglang muttered a bit.\n\n\"That's why I called you,\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. \"I said I treat you like a brother, so if the other side is terrifying, we'll die together. Isn't that romantic?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Romantic your ass, you pervert!\"\n\n\"It's fine. At worst, we'll go to hell. I've been there; I know the way.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured again, then took out his phone to look at the line in the photo, continuing to estimate the angle in his mind, and then pointed to the rooftop, saying, \"It's on the fifth floor. It shouldn't be too far off.\"\n\n\"Hey, you should have at least told me earlier so I could bring some magical artifacts!\" Xu Qinglang complained while following Zhou Ze up the stairs.\n\n\"Remember the night we subdued Bai Yingying? Whether you had magical artifacts or not made little difference.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was speechless for a moment and cursed, \"You heartless bastard.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused his steps and smiled.\n\nThen, the two of them walked together to the easternmost window-side location on the fifth floor.\n\nThis place was originally supposed to be an amusement park, but it had already accumulated dust. Some unremoved machinery and facilities were still left there, presenting an extremely desolate atmosphere.\n\nXu Qinglang was a bit nervous, while Zhou Ze continued to walk unhurriedly.\n\nIt should be at this exact spot.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze stopped in front of an inflatable toy castle.\n\n\"Oh, long time no see!\"\n\nA familiar voice came from behind the inflatable bed. Zhou Ze looked up and saw an old man in a stained, filthy Taoist robe jumping down from there.\n\n\"Big brother, long time no see, I really missed you. Come on, let's drink tonight, my treat. I'll repay you for last time!\"\n\nThe old Taoist walked over and greeted Zhou Ze.\n\nAnd just then, Xu Qinglang instinctively formed a hand seal with both hands: \"Heaven and Earth are Boundless, Profound Heart Righteous Law!\" He immediately bit his index finger, then touched it to the old Taoist's glabella.\n\nThe speed was quick, without any hesitation.\n\nBut the next scene shocked Xu Qinglang. The old Taoist glanced at Xu Qinglang twice as if nothing had happened, and said discontentedly, \"What's wrong with this guy? Or is this your family's custom, to smear blood on people's faces when you meet and greet? This f*cking game is cooler than the Dai Water-Splashing Festival! Come on, let me, the poor Taoist, teach you our hometown's customs too.\"\n\nSaying that, the old Taoist reached down and scratched his crotch, as if to return Xu Qinglang's gesture.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze suddenly extended his hand, his fingernails growing long, and directly clasped the old Taoist's neck.\n\nMeanwhile, the old Taoist, from the hand that had just been in his crotch, had inexplicably produced a bright yellow talisman paper, and was looking at Zhou Ze with a surprised expression: \"Damn it... you're faster... than me...\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over the talisman paper, then his nails tightened their grip. The old Taoist was shocked as if by electricity, and finally, with a gentle push from Zhou Ze, the old Taoist fell directly to the ground and rolled several times.\n\nIgnoring the old Taoist who had fallen to the ground unconscious, Zhou Ze leaped directly over the inflatable bed. Behind the inflatable bed lay a person, covered in injuries. He had found it. It was indeed here.",

    "title": "Chapter 74: A Man's Name, a Tree's Shadow",
    "content": "This was a woman, covered in a white dress, but beneath the white dress, her body was covered in scars and wounds, with different injuries seemingly on every part, truly shocking to behold.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's professional perspective, that this woman wasn't dead yet was truly a miracle.\n\nIn typical gunfight movies, tragic characters, after being shot many times, can still summon a last bit of inner strength to have a long, drawn-out flashback sequence and repeatedly shout \"You go!\", \"I'm not going!\", \"If you don't go, I won't go!\", and then pick up a gun to mow down a few enemies. This is basically impossible in reality.\n\nHumans are actually very fragile.\n\nThe reason the woman before him wasn't dead yet, still breathing, her chest rising and falling slightly, was also related to her own special nature.\n\nZhou Ze walked directly over, then pressed his fingernail into his palm, preparing to open the Gates of Hell.\n\n\"So direct?\" Xu Qinglang asked from behind. \"Aren't you going to ask?\"\n\n\"Nothing to ask.\"\n\nWhile the other party was still unconscious, pull her soul from her body and send it to hell—everything would be perfect.\n\nHowever, just then, the old Daoist, who had just been thrown by Zhou Ze, got up again and charged towards Zhou Ze.\n\nXu Qinglang stepped forward, extended his hand to block the old Daoist, then flung him to one side. The old Daoist had just been \"jolted\" a few times by Zhou Ze's fingernails; his body was still weak at this time, so naturally he was no match for Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Don't... don't do this, spare her, please spare her.\"\n\nThe old Daoist, lying to one side, began to plead.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was unmoved. A black, syrup-like thread was drawn out and formed a circle.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze reached out, intending to pull the other party's soul from her body. Although this soul was very weak now, Zhou Ze could already sense the powerful level of her soul.\n\nThis was a big fish, a prey much plumper than his previous insignificant catches!\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nAt this moment, a pen suddenly floated up and directly stabbed towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was quick-witted and agile; his body leaned slightly back, dodging the pen. But the pen's real target was not Zhou Ze, but Xu Qinglang; the pen tip aimed at Xu Qinglang's throat.\n\nAlthough Xu Qinglang's Adam's apple was not very prominent, at this moment, he held his hands wide, daring not to move at all.\n\nThe woman on the ground still had her eyes closed; she was still in a coma, but all of this was being controlled by her.\n\n\"Old Zhou, don't rush, don't rush!\"\n\nXu Qinglang yelled. He was afraid Zhou Ze would disregard his life or death. One must know, he himself was currently hanging by a thread, no less than someone holding a pistol to his temple.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze truly disregarded his life or death; his finger reached for the other party's forehead.\n\nThe pen tip, at this moment, also pierced Xu Qinglang's neck, making a small cut; blood was already flowing out.\n\n\"Ugh...\" Xu Qinglang felt the pain coming from his neck, yet he dared not reach out to grab the pen. He had a premonition that once he made any rash move, this pen could instantly pierce through his neck.\n\nThe woman didn't wake up, but for Zhou Ze, it was a silent threat.\n\nShe couldn't do anything to Zhou Ze, but she could threaten him with the lives of those around him.\n\n\"Those two people who died jumping from the building, they were pitiful.\" Zhou Ze suddenly said.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned; he didn't know what Zhou Ze meant by suddenly saying that.\n\n\"You cursed me earlier today for not going to warn them last night, and said I had changed.\" Zhou Ze continued.\n\n\"Huh?\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"So, I think you should be willing to sacrifice yourself to avenge them, right?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly clutched his chest with one hand and pressed the other hand on the ground. Cold sweat began to appear on his face; he made no further movements.\n\nAnd the pen also fell listlessly to the ground. Xu Qinglang clutched the small wound on his neck, gasping for breath repeatedly, muttering what sounded like curses, but it was unclear.\n\nThe old Daoist hurried to the woman's side, checking on her condition. He was a bit anxious, and a bit bewildered.\n\nZhou Ze glared at Xu Qinglang. If he had known, he wouldn't have brought him. Before, he had only thought that an extra person could help him find the target faster. Who would have thought Xu Qinglang would become the other party's leverage against him?\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze should have disregarded Xu Qinglang's life or death to complete his duty, but he forcibly changed his mind. Instantly, a sharp pain shot through his chest, hurting him so much he felt like dying.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThis is called a transaction, okay?\n\nIs this also called having a conscience?\n\nThis also makes me hurt?\n\nBesides, if he dies, who will make me sour sister juice?\n\nI'm just looking out for myself!\n\nThe old Daoist again reached into his crotch and took out a talisman. This guy's talismans were truly inexhaustible, and he especially liked to hide them in that spot. He didn't know if there was any particular significance to it.\n\n\"Brother, I'm sorry. I must protect this person. She barely managed to escape from Rongcheng; I cannot let her fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe old Daoist said to Zhou Ze, holding the talisman, finally apologizing:\n\n\"Sorry.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old Daoist was about to press the talisman onto Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze sharply raised his head; a black glint flashed in his eyes and was gone. However, before Zhou Ze could act, two figures appeared directly behind the old Daoist.\n\nXu Qinglang clutched his neck, but the syllables he uttered began to become clearer.\n\nThe old Daoist was lifted up entirely. He turned his head only to find that at some unknown point, a man and a woman had appeared behind him—two empty skin husks, yet possessing strength no less than an ordinary person.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Dang it!\"\n\nThe old Daoist was thrown out again, smashing onto the tiled floor.\n\nTwisting his body, clutching his waist with one hand, the old Daoist wailed:\n\n\"My waist...\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly calmed the sharp pain in his chest and raised his hand again. He knew that the woman before him was very weak; her previous resistance and stiffness was already the limit of what she could do.\n\n\"Brother, I beg you, spare her, let us go.\"\n\n\"Let you go?\" Xu Qinglang clutched his neck with one hand, and with the other, controlled the two puppet skin husks, slowly approaching the old Daoist. \"Then who will settle the score for those two people who died jumping from the building?\"\n\n\"Those two weren't killed by us! We didn't touch them! We even wanted to save them! They wanted to die themselves!\" The old Daoist explained.\n\n\"Do you think we'd believe such words?\" Xu Qinglang snorted coldly.\n\nThe old Daoist saw Xu Qinglang looking like he was possessed by a \"Messenger of Light.\" He immediately looked away from him and turned to Zhou Ze, pleading:\n\n\"Brother, she is also one of our Underworld Shop people. She's a friend of our boss; she was injured because she was helping my boss.\"\n\nThe old Daoist remembered that when he first met Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze was actually very interested in his boss's affairs. At this time, he could only try to bring up his boss.\n\nZhou Ze's hand had just rested on the woman's forehead, without applying force yet. When he heard the old Daoist's words, he immediately stopped.\n\nWas she that man's companion?\n\nThat man who was struggling to drink congee behind the Underworld Shop counter in the old Daoist's live stream video?\n\nThat man who had warned him about the Faceless Woman's scheme by the pond in his dream?\n\nHe owed him a favor.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nHis chest hurt again.\n\nZhou Ze kept taking deep breaths, then stepped back two paces and shakily stood up.\n\nFortunately, the pain didn't last too long. But every time he made a choice that violated the principle of prioritizing self-interest, and began to be burdened by human relationships, it would always remind him.\n\nAs if a poisonous scorpion was always hidden in his chest.\n\nThere was a famous monkey cage electric shock experiment.\n\nPerhaps, the cost and purpose of being without a conscience was exactly this: to make you form a conditioned reflex of fear, and slowly change your previous \"bad\" habits.\n\n\"You're not actually believing him, are you?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand.\n\n\"Hey, who's so foolish as to jump to their death one after another? Didn't you say earlier...\"\n\n\"I believe that guy.\" Zhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang, then looked at the old Daoist. \"Take her and leave, don't appear before me again.\"\n\nA person's reputation precedes them. As for the matter of those two lovers dying by jumping from the building one day after the other, Zhou Ze no longer believed it was this woman's doing. This woman might have participated in the Ouija board game and might have acted within it, but she was definitely not killing.\n\nThe little loli once said that man from Rongcheng had played with fire, appointing himself a judge, operating outside human laws to carry out his so-called righteous judgments, which is why he incurred a ban from the Underworld.\n\nFor this reason, a friend of such a person could not possibly be a randomly killing evil spirit. Otherwise, with that guy's personality, he would have been the first to kill the woman.\n\nThis deduction was truly more credible than any so-called evidence, because even when the little loli spoke of that person, she only mocked him for his arrogance, but she never criticized his private morality in the slightest.\n\nThe old Daoist immediately stood up, clutching his waist, thanking him profusely. But when he reached the woman's side, he again said with a bitter expression:\n\n\"Brother, we have nowhere to go! She asked me to bring her here before, thinking that by staying close to you, we could be in a blind spot, so that those who are trying to catch her wouldn't notice this place.\n\nIf I take her away now, wouldn't it be like a lamb entering a tiger's den?\"\n\n\"You... are being hunted?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uh, something like that. In short, those guys are elusive; they can pop out anywhere. From mirrors, from crowds, even from bushes, from underground—they can emerge. It's also thanks to luck that we've managed to escape all the way here alive.\"\n\n\"Then it's pointless. Her injuries have severely worsened; she can't hold on much longer.\" Zhou Ze rubbed his fingers. \"Once this physical body is destroyed, with only her soul remaining, she'll either be discovered quickly or fall directly into hell.\"\n\n\"We went to a hospital earlier to treat her injuries, but as soon as we entered the ward, the doctor, who had looked completely normal, directly shed his clothes and turned into a hideous thing that tried to kill us.\"\n\nThe old Daoist said, looking very troubled.\n\n\"It was only in the past two days, staying near you, that we've had some peace.\"\n\n\"I can't help you.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nHis admiration for that person from Rongcheng was indeed admiration, and the favor he owed had been repaid by turning a blind eye this time. He certainly didn't want to create more complications; otherwise, next time, the little loli would bring a bunch of ghost messengers directly to his bookstore.\n\nAt this moment, the pen that had fallen to the ground suddenly stood upright. Xu Qinglang's expression changed, showing a wary look.\n\nBut the pen just wrote a few words on the ground:\n\n\"Save me, give you heart.\"\n\nSeeing these words, Zhou Ze's gaze immediately sharpened.\n\n\"Shameless little bitch!\n\nHow confident is this woman about her looks? You save her, and she gives her heart to who?\"\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed from the side. \"No matter how beautiful you were before, now that you look like this, what idiot would want your heart?!\"\n\n\"I am willing.\"\n\n\"What?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned, looking at Zhou Ze, as if at this moment, Xu Qinglang truly saw Zhou Ze clearly. Doctor Lin was so beautiful, yet he could pass by her door three times without entering¹ — so he actually had *this* kind of taste.\n\n\"Brother, didn't you just say there was no way?\" The old Daoist asked doubtfully from the side.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. Just remembered, I was Tongcheng's best surgeon in my previous life.\"\n\n---\n¹ **三過家門而不入 (sān guò jiā mén ér bù rù)**: A classical Chinese idiom referring to Yu the Great, who was so dedicated to flood control that he passed by his home three times without entering. Here, it's used humorously and sarcastically to imply Zhou Ze's utter disinterest in women, even attractive ones, contrasted with his sudden interest in the injured woman.",

    "content": "「Hey, Zhou Ze, you've changed. Are you still human? You were the one who said she killed those two people before, and now you're the one who wants to save her! One moment you want me to go with you to catch the killer, the next you want me to help you move the killer back.\n\nWhat exactly do you take me for?!”\n\nBack in the bookstore, Xu Qinglang muttered directly, pointing at Zhou Ze's back.\n\nNo, to be precise, all the way down from the building, Xu Qinglang had not stopped his verbal barrage, nagging like he was scolding a scoundrel husband who messed around outside for several nights, didn't come home, and didn't even provide living expenses.\n\nBai Yingying sat behind the counter playing with her phone. She didn't dare to open the computer to play games anymore; the occasional power outages were truly unbearable.\n\nZhou Ze originally had no intention of bothering with Xu Qinglang. He didn't have the time for it now, but Xu Qinglang seemed addicted to running his mouth. Zhou Ze turned directly, pointed a finger at the other's nose, and said bluntly:\n\n\"What do I take you for? Haven't you heard the saying, 'No investigation, no right to speak'?\n\nI don't know her, but I know her friend. I owe that person in Rongcheng a favor. I ask you, is that reason enough?\"\n\n\"What about those two dead people...?\"\n\n\"Do I know those two dead people?\" Zhou Ze retorted. \"What does it have to do with me? Am I Joan of Arc or Hai Rui? Have I asked the locals to build me a temple and offer me incense for merit?\n\nI'm just an unlucky ghost who was bought out and run over by an idiot, and then by a twist of fate, I possessed this idiot's body!\n\nI'm not human, I'm just a ghost. So please, Mr. Xu, with your twenty-plus apartments, stop imposing your set of universal values on me!\n\nYou want me to dedicate myself? You want me to pursue truth and facts?\n\nThen please, when your neck was being poked by that pen just now, yell: 'Fire at me!'\n\nYou can't even do that yourself, and you have the nerve to criticize others?\n\nI'm a ghost, and for a long time, I didn't even have a legal identity. Under these circumstances, you still demand that I be 'all for one,' but when will 'one' ever be for me?\"\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"What 'you'? Didn't you yourself violate the rules back then by forcibly keeping your parents' deceased souls to enjoy some kind of family reunion atmosphere?\n\nWhen you were doing something like that, why didn't you think about all the bereaved families in the world who don't get that kind of treatment?\n\nI don't care if she killed anyone or not. The favor I owe that person in Rongcheng is enough for me to turn a blind eye!\n\nI don't care if she's the killer or not. She promised to get my heart back, so I'm willing to help treat her!\n\nIt's that simple!\n\nSo, please take your arrogance, your self-righteousness, and your loftiness, and gracefully roll over to the next room!\"\n\nZhou Ze finished speaking all this in one breath, letting out a long sigh. Honestly, he had been really annoyed lately, especially after that incident with Houzi. Really, really annoyed.\n\nHe shouldn't have meddled. He could have even covered his eyes and pretended not to see anything, so he wouldn't have to make any decisions, and his heart wouldn't have been taken by that old geezer.\n\nLike an ostrich burying its head in the sand, wiggling its rump, swaying back and forth,\n\nShouting, 'This world is so beautiful, so beautiful, oh so beautiful!'\n\nHow good that would be,\n\nHow comfortable that would be.\n\nXu Qinglang swallowed hard. Faced with Zhou Ze's verbal counterattack, he was somewhat flustered.\n\nThe scene, for a moment, turned quiet.\n\nBai Yingying had been watching for a long time, not daring to interject.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, perhaps feeling 'no greater sorrow than a dead heart.' Indeed, the 'tempest-battered crabapple' was a bit disheveled. Then he waved his sleeve and turned towards the door, but stopped as he pushed open the glass door and said:\n\n\"What do you want for lunch?\"\n\n\"Tomato beef rice with strawberry juice, please,\" Zhou Ze answered without hesitation.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nXu Qinglang left, to cook.\n\nBai Yingying stuck out her tongue, then covered her nose.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her, \"If you want to say you smell something sour again, then the toilet's clogged again. Brush it three more times.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately shook her head, \"It's sweet.\"\n\nJust then, a van stopped in front of the bookstore.\n\n\"Go move the stuff.\"\n\nUnder Zhou Ze's command, Bai Yingying went out and carried two boxes inside. The van dropped off the items and left.\n\n\"What's in here?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"Simple surgical instruments.\" Zhou Ze opened one of the boxes and took out a pair of gloves to put on.\n\n\"Boss, how did you get someone to send these?\"\n\n\"I was a doctor in my previous life.\"\n\n\"Uh, and then?\"\n\n\"Then, of course, I know which director smuggles medical equipment, takes kickbacks, and lines his own pockets. Making a call to threaten him, and having him send over some inexpensive instruments, is a very simple matter.\"\n\n\"That works too?\" Bai Yingying was stunned for a moment, taking a while to react.\n\n\"Bring the stuff upstairs.\" Zhou Ze finished speaking and went upstairs first.\n\nOn the straw mat on the second floor, the woman lay there. The old Daoist knelt beside her, a cigarette dangling from his mouth. When Zhou Ze came over, the old Daoist said with some concern:\n\n\"Brother, do you have a plan?\"\n\n\"Then you can send her to the hospital, and then be discovered by those ghost officers.\"\n\nThe old Daoist said nothing more.\n\nBai Yingying carried one box in each hand, not bothering at all. Sometimes Zhou Ze would feel it was a loss; if he wasn't running a bookstore but a construction team, having Bai Yingying as a subordinate would definitely be a gain. He could save on excavators, bulldozers, and the like.\n\nEverything was ready. After sterilizing the instruments, Zhou Ze began preparing for the surgery.\n\n\"Brother, aren't you going to use anesthesia?\" the old Daoist reminded him from the side.\n\n\"She doesn't need anesthesia. Her mental will is terrifying.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and directly used scissors to cut open the wound that had been hastily bandaged after the woman was injured.\n\nThese wounds weren't handled poorly, but the injuries themselves weren't ordinary. Ordinary bandaging had no effect whatsoever.\n\n\"That's true. They say she didn't sleep for half a year once and still got through it,\" the old Daoist muttered from the side.\n\nZhou Ze opened a wound on her left arm, then poked around inside with forceps. The woman showed no reaction; she seemed to be in a deep sleep.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze used the forceps to clamp out a black feather from inside the wound and dropped it onto the metal tray held by Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Clatter...\"\n\nThis feather was very soft, but it made a crisp sound when it fell.\n\n\"This humble Daoist remembers that this feather should come from a black feather duster. There was a pale-faced guy in black clothes who chased us with it.\"\n\n\"Black Wuchang?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Don't know, a bit like him,\" the old Daoist replied.\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal and continued cleaning the wound.\n\nMy goodness,\n\nWho knew how many strange things were embedded in this woman's body.\n\nIn the time that followed, Zhou Ze successively extracted broken talismans, darts engraved with runes, and released silvery mercury water. It was like he was running a general store, with a bit of everything.\n\nBai Yingying and the old Daoist on the side were dizzy from watching.\n\nDuring the process, although the remnants inside the wounds were cleared out one by one, for this body, it was no less than a secondary injury. Therefore, Zhou Ze was constantly monitoring the woman's condition.\n\nFinally, when Zhou Ze extracted two pieces of red shattered glass from the wound on the woman's lower abdomen, he noticed faint black mist rising from her body, and a shadow seemed about to float out.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze could see this sight.\n\nThis was a sign that the body was on the verge of collapsing and unable to retain the soul. Interpreted from a scientific perspective, it meant the patient was about to die from failed resuscitation.\n\nZhou Ze's right fingernail grew longer, and he directly grabbed the black shadow, pressing it back into the body.\n\n\"Mm...\"\n\nA faint sound emerged.\n\n\"Hold on a bit longer. There are a few more wounds that need to be treated, and then apply some medicine. If you get through this, your body will slowly recover.\"\n\nThis was the most extraordinary surgery Zhou Ze had performed since becoming a doctor. Not to mention the complexity of the patient's injuries, just the fact that he was treating her while simultaneously pushing her soul back into her body as it was about to leave would be enough to shock the entire medical community if word got out.\n\nThis was almost like cheating, like playing an arcade game where you have countless coins allowing you to keep extending your life.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze also understood that this was because the woman's soul was inherently strong. An ordinary person's soul might withstand one such ordeal, but repeated attempts would likely cause it to directly collapse.\n\nFrom this perspective, the woman's resilience was indeed terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze was even a little curious: if a woman beside him was this resilient and terrifying, what must the person stirring up trouble in Rongcheng be like himself?\n\nBirds of a feather flock together, after all.\n\nHaving dealt with the last wound and applied the medicine, Zhou Ze let out a long sigh.\n\nNext, it would depend on her own willpower to endure. Once her body slowly recovered, the problem shouldn't be too big.\n\nActually, if that old geezer who dug out his heart was still around, getting some medicine from him would be best. Zhou Ze's own wound on his chest had already healed, without even leaving a scar.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze sometimes wondered if the other party had really opened him up and dug out his heart?\n\nOr perhaps, he had merely fallen under a powerful illusion? But then where did that painful feeling come from every time he tried to do something that went against his self-interest?\n\nThe woman was settled upstairs. The old Daoist went to the restaurant next door for a meal, and Bai Yingying ran off to play games. Only Zhou Ze remained, checking on the woman's condition.\n\nAfter a few hours, Zhou Ze, who was sitting by the side reading a book, suddenly noticed the woman's eyelids twitch. Then he saw her open her eyes.\n\nThe woman was looking at him,\n\nHe was also looking at the woman.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman slightly nodded, indicating her body was getting better.\n\n\"Heh heh, what's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman was silent for a long time. Just as Zhou Ze was wondering if her physical condition currently prevented her from speaking, the woman opened her mouth and said:\n\n\"Tang... Shi...\"\n\n\"My name is...\" Zhou Ze paused, then asked with a hint of curiosity:\n\n\"Every time you introduce your name to someone, do you often encounter jokers who say their name is Song Ci?\"",

    "content": "The days passed, unhurriedly and calmly, for three more days.\n\nDuring these three days, Xu Qinglang was busy looking for a new shop. This long-abandoned commercial center had already seen two deaths; setting up shop here again would simply be asking for trouble. He had asked Zhou Ze for his opinion, if he was willing to move with him, and he could also help Zhou Ze find a new storefront along the way. Zhou Ze's response to this was noncommittal.\n\nOn one hand, Zhou Ze didn't really value the presence of living people around the bookstore, but on the other hand, without the concoctions prepared by Xu Qinglang, eating would become a problem again.\n\nOne more thing happened in these three days: the police found suicide notes in both Mr. Chen's and Ms. Liu's homes, and also found their wedding photos.\n\nHowever, the wedding photos were black and white, and the content of the suicide notes was even harder for ordinary people to comprehend.\n\nThey had agreed to die together for love, ending their lives in a terrifying manner. In the suicide notes, they apologized to the other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association for the trouble and investigation caused, and at the same time stated that this was the true horror story.\n\nThey had met because of their love for \"horror,\" so naturally, they had to prove their love in the most \"horrific\" way.\n\nThese messages also spread online, causing an uproar in public opinion and simultaneously reigniting discussions. Many major influencers once again brandished their whips to criticize horror and suspense films, TV shows, and novels, saying, \"Look, this is misleading the youth! These things should be banned.\"\n\nBut in reality, what should be banned are ancient love stories like \"Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,\" because these stories glorify the theme of dying for love, leading to people continuously imitating it in later generations.\n\nThe woman named Tang Shi had been staying on the second floor. After her injuries were dealt with, and three more days had passed, Zhou Ze finally came before her. He had done what he promised her; now it was her turn to fulfill her end of the bargain.\n\n\"Those two, they really committed suicide, right?\"\n\nTang Shi was still lying there, her body bandaged in many places, looking like a female mummy. There was truly no way to care about aesthetics, simply because her original injuries were too severe and too numerous.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"When they were playing the psychic pen game, I sensed it.\" Tang Shi's eyes looked at Zhou Ze. \"At the time, I found it very interesting. They wanted to see ghosts, but they didn't realize that the owner of the bookstore they were in was a ghost, and an Underworld envoy at that.\n\nIn fact, when that woman was about to jump off the building on the first night, I tried to control the white dress on me to stop her, but her mind was made up, and I was very weak, so I couldn't stop her; she still jumped.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\n\"Ignorant men and women always think death is a beautiful thing, but I estimate they are probably regretting their initial decision in hell right now. Hell is a terrifying place, enough to make most suicides regret and curse their foolish past selves.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nTang Shi paused, then continued, \"You are much luckier than us; you haven't experienced the true horror of hell.\"\n\n\"Time to get to the point.\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"It's about your heart, isn't it?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"Do you think your heart is gone?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"But it can't be gone. There are many incredible things in this world, but generally, there's still a line maintaining balance.\n\nFor example, my injuries, as you can see, those envoys who escaped from the Underworld, what they left on me were things like black feathers, mercury water, and talisman papers. Their image in the eyes of ordinary people is very mysterious and awe-inspiring;\n\nbut in reality, just like a goddess eventually has to use the restroom, setting aside the mysterious veil of them being able to enter and exit hell, they are actually very ordinary.\n\nAnd even, they are far from having the ability to move mountains and fill seas, as described in so-called superhero movies or cultivation fantasy novels.\n\nOf course, I'm not saying no one has this ability, but I am certain that such an existence with this ability cannot leave hell.\"\n\n\"So, what exactly are you trying to say?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Regarding your lost heart, you told me about it. You shouldn't be able to eat, right, just like us? In these past few days, I've seen you forcing down food with extremely sour and sweet drinks when you eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"But you said that when you ate your own heart, you didn't feel the slightest discomfort, and even found it a little delicious.\"\n\n\"You mean, what I ate wasn't actually my heart? No, it's that I wasn't eating anything substantial at all.\"\n\nZhou Ze quickly understood, and continued:\n\n\"The meal, the dining table, the knife and fork—they were all fake, all illusions.\"\n\nTang Shi nodded slightly. She seemed a little tired, but still spoke:\n\n\"No matter how mysterious or terrifying an existence, they don't have the ability to make dry bones grow flesh, and even less likely to have the ability to turn decay into wonder by digging out a body's heart while keeping the physical body just as active as before.\n\nTherefore, you must have been hypnotized, a very profound hypnosis, one from which you yourself cannot extricate yourself.\"\n\n\"Hypnosis?\"\n\n\"Yes, hypnosis. The dining environment, every word the other person said, every action, all were giving you psychological suggestions. Otherwise, why wouldn't he just pick up some firewood by the roadside and have a barbecue with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. In fact, Tang Shi's words coincided with his own previous guesses in many respects.\n\nFor example, every time he made a choice that went against his current interests, his chest would ache, but if he just endured it for a while, he could still continue with his original choice.\n\nBecause in his subconscious, he believed he no longer had a conscience, so after doing anything that stemmed from \"conscience,\" he would always remind himself:\n\nOh, I shouldn't be doing this, and then it would hurt.\n\nIt's just like how a person who experienced hardship in childhood and suffered psychological trauma will still feel physical and mental discomfort when seeing similar things or scenes again.\n\n\"So I should go see a psychologist?\"\n\n\"I know a very capable psychologist; he can help you with your problem.\" Tang Shi said.\n\n\"That one?\" Zhou Ze naturally thought of who it was.\n\n\"As long as he can come back alive, he can solve your problem.\"\n\n\"Who knows where he's run off to now?\"\n\n\"He didn't run.\" Tang Shi corrected him, \"He went to find them.\"\n\nThe conversation ended there. As Zhou Ze was about to go downstairs, Tang Shi said again:\n\n\"Can you call that female zombie up here?\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"To have her sleep with me.\"\n\n\"I'll go ask her if she agrees.\"\n\nGoing downstairs, Bai Yingying was sitting behind the counter playing a mobile game. Zhou Ze didn't pay attention to her, nor did he ask Bai Yingying for the woman upstairs. He walked straight out the door and hailed a cab.\n\nA psychologist—he really did know an excellent one.\n\nLast time, Wang Ke had told him that he wouldn't look for Zhou Ze again in the future, but if Zhou Ze needed anything, he could go to him.\n\nHe really hit the mark.\n\nIt was already 11 AM when he arrived by taxi at the entrance of Wang Ke's villa. Zhou Ze rang the doorbell.\n\nThe door opened, and Wang Ke, dressed in pajamas, appeared at the door. Seeing Zhou Ze, he paused for a moment, then gestured for Zhou Ze to come in.\n\nWaves of meaty aroma came from inside the house. Meat must have been stewing in the kitchen.\n\n\"Care for a bite?\" Wang Ke suggested. \"Freshly bought large bones, stewed for ages. I remember when we were kids in the orphanage, it wasn't easy to get a meal with meat.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"My appetite isn't great.\"\n\n\"No problem, then just have some soup. By the way, you're here for something, right?\"\n\n\"I was hypnotized. The person who hypnotized me told me I had lost my conscience. Now, I want to get my conscience back.\" Zhou Ze went straight to the point.\n\nWang Ke frowned, looking a bit awkward and uneasy, and said:\n\n\"Last time I tried, I couldn't hypnotize you. You said you couldn't sleep under normal circumstances, so I can't use the most direct and effective method on you. I can only try indirect methods to see if they'll work.\"\n\n\"Give it a try.\"\n\nThe two came to Wang Ke's study.\n\nWang Ke changed into formal attire and sat down behind his desk, then handed Zhou Ze a pocket watch.\n\n\"You use this to swing in front of me and try to hypnotize me. Then we two can establish a reverse psychological connection.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't hesitate, directly taking the pocket watch and starting to swing it in front of Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke watched very intently. As he watched, he closed his eyes.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze also felt a little tired, as if Wang Ke's \"sleep\" at this moment had more or less affected him too.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke didn't answer.\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Wang Ke.\"\n\nIt was a very novel feeling. Zhou Ze didn't have much experience in this area, but at this moment, it seemed no experience was needed either.\n\n\"You...\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze felt his vision blur. Vaguely, he seemed to hear a man asking him a question:\n\n\"Do you think you need a conscience?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit lost, but still said, \"Doing good deeds might lead to bad outcomes.\"\n\n\"So, deep down, you're actually very repulsed by the behaviors you consistently upheld before.\" The man's voice came again.\n\nNext, was a long conversation. Zhou Ze himself was a bit confused, as if the conversation and questions had nothing to do with him.\n\nIn front of him, a pot was placed. Soup was simmering in the pot, with large bones boiling inside. The aroma of the soup was very rich.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nThe pocket watch fell from Zhou Ze's hand onto the floor.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes.\n\nWang Ke behind the desk also opened his eyes. His eyes were bloodshot, and he looked very tired.\n\n\"Was it a success?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke nodded, then shook his head, saying apologetically:\n\n\"Your problem is a bit complicated. In fact, the one truly struggling with whether or not to have a conscience is yourself. It might be that some recent experiences have loosened your original beliefs, and with external forces pushing it, it formed a psychological knot.\"\n\nZhou Ze heard this, nodded, looking thoughtful.\n\n\"By the way, did you ask me any questions?\" Wang Ke suddenly asked.\n\nThis kind of hypnosis was inherently mutual. In fact, what Wang Ke performed on Zhou Ze was a superficial hypnosis, while Wang Ke, on the other hand, completely bared his soul to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I didn't ask, because I only saw a pot of meat soup. Are you very hungry?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm hungry.\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\nImmediately after, Wang Ke pulled Zhou Ze to the kitchen, opened the pressure cooker, and inside, pork ribs were stewing.\n\n\"Come, let's eat a little together. Consider it reliving childhood.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a little unreal.\n\nA wealthy psychologist, overjoyed, stewing a pot of pork ribs himself at home—this scene always gave one a feeling that something was off.\n\nZhou Ze even felt a slight nausea and revulsion in his chest.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously took a few steps back and exited the kitchen.\n\nWang Ke, on the other hand, was diligently preparing the dipping sauce, saying, \"Come on, eat a little with your brother.\"\n\n\"You eat it yourself.\" Zhou Ze still refused, his gaze occasionally sweeping towards the pressure cooker and the pork ribs constantly boiling within it.\n\n\"Don't be shy, this is meat I painstakingly selected; the taste is surely great.\" Wang Ke continued to invite.\n\n\"Where's Sister-in-law?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke's hand holding the plate suddenly trembled, and his expression became a bit unnatural,\n\nbut he still said, \"She went to get her hair done.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze was noncommittal.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze glanced at the pressure cooker again.\n\nThe nausea and revulsion in his chest seemed to be intensifying.\n\n\"Husband, you're boiling meat soup again.\" At this moment, a woman's voice came from the entryway.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, saw her, and suddenly felt a great weight lifted from his mind.\n\nI was overthinking.\n\n\"Indeed, this is just my hobby.\" Wang Ke said with a chuckle.\n\nThe woman walked up to Zhou Ze, saying helplessly, \"Isn't it incredible? A master psychologist's hobby is to find some free time to stew a pot of meat soup for himself, even if he can't eat it at all, he still really enjoys this sense of satisfaction.\"\n\n\"It's alright.\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips. \"When he was young, conditions weren't good, so now that he's grown up, he's fulfilling a dream.\"\n\n\"Come, have a bowl.\"\n\nWang Ke served a bowl of soup, sprinkled minced garlic and chopped green onions into it, and added two drops of sesame oil and some white pepper.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the soup. As he was hesitating whether to force himself to drink some,\n\nhe suddenly noticed,\n\nthe woman standing beside him,\n\nshe was walking on tiptoes,\n\none step, two steps, three steps,\n\nShe walked to the pressure cooker, helped Wang Ke serve soup, and at the same time, exhorted:\n\n\"Eat more, don't waste it.\"",

    "content": "「This soup, should I drink it?」\n\nZhou Ze slightly frowned, then put the bowl down, looking at Wang Ke, and also at Wang Ke's wife.\n\nWang Ke's wife took a chair and sat down, then rubbed her heel, complaining:\n\n「Hubby, my heel isn't better yet.」\n\n「Who told you to be so careless? It's lucky your bones are fine.」\n\nWang Ke carefully observed his wife's heel, smiled, and said:\n\n「You should go back to the room to rest first. Don't run around outside much these days. It's really too tiring to see you always walking on tiptoes, and you're even wearing high heels.」\n\n「Alright, alright, wasn't I just trying to make myself look better so you'd feel more comfortable seeing me at home?」\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes at her husband, then gave Zhou Ze a slight smile, 「You two talk, I'll head up first.」\n\nAfter the woman left, Wang Ke pointed at the bowl Zhou Ze had just put down, reminding:\n\n「The soup's getting cold.」\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, took out a cigarette, lit it, and without any regard for being in someone else's home, started smoking on his own.\n\nAfter a while, Zhou Ze finally asked:\n\n「What do you mean?」\n\n「As the mood strikes.」 Wang Ke shook his head, then pointed at the pot of meat soup, saying, 「Did you think earlier that this pot of meat soup contained human flesh?」\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\nWang Ke also pulled out a cigarette, lit it with the flame from the gas stove, and said:\n\n「This is psychological suggestion. Everyone encounters this kind of psychological suggestion more or less in their daily lives. For example, you just left your home, and suddenly an aunt next to you tells her child to lock the door properly after people leave, otherwise the house will be stolen.\n\nYou will subconsciously reflect on whether you actually closed the door, then constantly recall and agonize, and finally run back to personally check if the door was indeed closed.\n\nThis is relatively common and simple. A slightly more advanced form operates continuously through repeated actions and awareness of psychological suggestion, thereby achieving this effect.\n\nFor example, you believed I was actually cooking a pot of human flesh soup in my own kitchen, and you didn't dare to drink it.」\n\nWang Ke shrugged,\n\n「Is it absurd? Yes, it's very absurd, but you believed it. That's the most absurd part, yet also the most normal thing.」\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth and asked, 「Is this also part of the treatment?」\n\nWang Ke shook his head, 「No, this isn't a disease. We psychologists rarely refer to psychological issues as 'diseases.' This is your own emotional knot.\n\nIt's like why you would think I'd cook human flesh. This psychological suggestion has actually been going on for a long time. For example, my wife, who always likes to get her hair done outside but comes back with her hairstyle barely changed.\n\nYou think I have a motive to kill her. What's the reason?\n\nI was cuckolded; she found a man outside and gave me a cute green hat.」¹\n\n「Cute...」\n\n「Alright, you can ignore the adjective 'cute' for now. But undeniably, this was the biggest hint that led you to mistakenly believe I was cooking my wife's flesh at home.\n\nBecause you thought I already knew about this, and in fact, I did know about this long ago. Then, you naturally assumed I would get angry. Alright, I was indeed very angry.\n\nAfter that, you thought I had a motive to kill her and eat her flesh, because I should vent my anger in this way.\n\nOf course, there were some auxiliary hints, such as my identity. My biggest hobby is actually cooking a huge pot of meat soup at home that I can't possibly finish by myself, simply to make up for the regret of not having enough meat when conditions were poor in the orphanage during my childhood.\n\nThis contrast made it difficult for you to acknowledge, and your brain naturally began to form your own line of thought, a line of thought that you felt could be explained.\n\nThat is what we often call your perceived 'truth,' just like many 'melon-eating crowds'² online. A very simple event can often be exploited by some intentional individuals for hype and fermentation, and it's also based on this reason.\n\nEveryone's heart harbors a Shakespeare, and also a Sherlock Holmes.」\n\nWang Ke picked up a piece of meat with chopsticks, dipped it in the sauce dish, then put it into his mouth and chewed with his eyes closed.\n\n「Are you really not going to eat? It's very tasty. I remember when we were kids in the orphanage, you often competed with me for meat.」\n\n「In the end, you always left your chicken leg for me.」 Zhou Ze said.\n\n「Haha, who told you to be younger than me, who told you to call me 'Brother'?」 Wang Ke waved his hand dismissively, 「Actually, at that time, I really loved eating meat too, but I never got enough.\n\nNow that I have the means, I can eat meat to my heart's content, but every time I excitedly and wholeheartedly cook a big pot, I get full after only a little.\n\nMy body isn't as good as before, and I'm not a young lad anymore. Plus, since I started working, my living conditions have slowly improved.\n\nNow, ironically, I feel it was most delicious when I watched you eat my portion of the chicken leg back in the orphanage.」\n\nWang Ke picked up another piece of meat, put it into his mouth, and after eating it, let out a sigh.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring, said nothing, just silently leaned against the kitchen wall, watching the white smoke billow inside, watching the middle-aged man's weariness and sighs.\n\n「Let's talk about your problem. Actually, the problem still lies with yourself. Honestly, wasn't it most comfortable when you were a doctor?\n\nNo matter what problems you encountered at work, no matter the infighting, no matter the exclusion and suppression,\n\nwhen a patient was brought before you, treating illnesses and saving lives was always the right thing to do.\n\nIt conformed to the nature of your work, and to the moral ethics of human society.\n\nA single phrase, 'the heart of a healer is like that of a parent,' allowed you to disregard the patient's identity, their personality, what they had done before, whether they were good or bad, poor or rich.\n\nAs long as they were brought before you, the only thing you had to do, and must do, was to cure them.\n\nBut now, you've encountered decision paralysis. In some choices, you need to consider more circumstances, and you have to gauge the extent yourself. This makes you very uncomfortable and also greatly troubles you.\n\nYou want to be resolutely yourself, free and unburdened like characters in wuxia novels, but you can't help but be constrained by the trivialities before you.\n\nActually, this is the normal state for most people, A Ze. You used to live a bit too self-centeredly. Both you and I grew up in an orphanage; we both experienced childhood misfortunes and endured the pressure and low self-esteem from the lack of our own families in our youth.\n\nIn fact, both of us have, more or less, some psychological issues. These were seeds, and now they have blossomed and borne fruit in you.\n\nYou say your conscience is gone, but it's actually still there. You instinctively reject it, instinctively detest it, but you also can't abandon it.\n\nSo your subconscious created this situation: your conscience was eaten by you, and thus you can perfectly ignore it.」\n\n「How do I solve it?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Unless a master of psychology appears who can completely transcend you in consciousness, breaking the shackles in your mind in one go, able to make you passively endure their hypnosis.\n\nOtherwise, you can only slowly wear it down yourself. Perhaps you wear it down, or it wears you down.」\n\nWang Ke took another sip of soup. It must have been delicious, as an expression of satisfaction appeared on his face. 「Brother, my skill isn't enough, or rather, I might have some methods for ordinary people's psychological issues, but you're not an ordinary person.」\n\nZhou Ze nodded, 「So, all of this can only take its natural course?」\n\n「You don't have to resist it. Instead, you can accept it, even treat it as a person, as your other side.」 Wang Ke tried to offer his solution. 「What I'm saying is a bit abstract. It's best if you can understand it, but it doesn't matter if you can't. Letting nature take its course is also fine.」\n\nPutting down his bowl and chopsticks, Wang Ke and Zhou Ze walked into the living room. Wang Ke re-brewed a pot of tea.\n\nThe local news of Tongcheng was playing on TV. Coincidentally, a face somewhat familiar to Zhou Ze appeared in the news—a simple, honest face. He was crying, he was raging.\n\nHowever, most of the preceding news had already been broadcast; this was already the end.\n\nWang Ke saw Zhou Ze watching the news and explained, 「This matter has been heavily hyped recently. His son got leukemia, and he wanted to find his second daughter, who he had given away previously. After mobilizing the media, he finally found her.\n\nBut the second daughter and her adoptive parents refused to donate. He and his wife went to their home to block them, loudly scolding his daughter for being heartless at the entrance of their residential community. Then, he even went to the second daughter's high school to put up dazibao³, enumerating his second daughter's 'sins,' forcing her to come out and donate.」\n\n「Oh.」\n\nZhou Ze picked up his tea and took a sip.\n\n「These days, all sorts of strange things are happening,」 Wang Ke sighed.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Wang Ke and said, 「Actually, they used to happen too, but there wasn't such a developed information network back then.」\n\n「Are you implying something?」\n\n「No.」\n\n「Don't look down on your brother,」 Wang Ke suddenly said seriously.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n「Everyone has their own difficulties. Brother doesn't want to, but I can be open-minded about it.」\n\n「I'm leaving. Thank you for today's diagnosis.」\n\n「Don't be a stranger. I've said before, I won't look for you again in the future, but if you have something, you can always come to me.」\n\nEscorted by Wang Ke, Zhou Ze walked out of his house. He turned his head to look at the second-floor balcony of Wang Ke's home; the loli⁴ wasn't there.\n\nYes,\n\nThe loli couldn't possibly be there. She must have already taken the Faceless Woman and the other ghost envoys to Rongcheng, right?\n\nHe hailed a taxi, got in, and the driver turned his head, 「Buddy, where to?」\n\n「Take me to the place that's most unclean.」\n\nZhou Ze felt he should proactively go out and find something to do, get some achievements.\n\n「Oh, brother, are you a writer? Going out to find inspiration?」\n\n「Something like that.」\n\n「Alright, I do know a place.」\n\nThe driver patted his chest, guaranteeing to find Zhou Ze a good place. That place had been very eerie lately; ordinary people didn't dare to pass by there at night.\n\nThen,\n\nThe driver dropped Zhou Ze off at the entrance of 「Late Night Bookstore.」\n\nThat damned crow appeared again, slowly flying across the sky with a 「caw caw caw.」 It seemed to be very good at flying out exactly when it was most needed.\n\nA breeze blew fallen leaves, which swirled at Zhou Ze's feet, making a 「rustling」 sound.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and glanced at the taxi that had already driven away,\n\nAnd suddenly felt he should talk to Xu Qinglang about moving.\n\n...\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Wang Ke walked into the bedroom. His wife was lying on the bed playing with her phone. Seeing her husband approach, she changed into a graceful pose,\n\n「He left, then?」\n\n「Mm, he left.」 Wang Ke smiled and sat down by the bed, reaching out to caress his wife's cheek, saying:\n\n「You've gotten thin. Too thin. Not even tasty anymore.」\n\n「You rascal, all you men are like this. You want your wives to have a good figure to save face when you take them out, and you also want them to have a bit of flesh in bed to make you comfortable.」\n\n「Getting old. Meat that's too lean gets stuck in the teeth.」\n\nSaying that,\n\nWang Ke extended a finger and picked some meat fibers from between his teeth,\n\n「Don't lose any more weight.」\n\n---\n¹ In Chinese culture, \"wearing a green hat\" (戴綠帽子) is an idiom referring to a man whose wife has cheated on him, making him a cuckold.\n² A slang term used to describe people who passively watch or follow a popular event or scandal without getting involved, similar to watching a show while eating melon seeds.\n³ A Chinese term for a large-character poster, typically handwritten and used for public announcements, political propaganda, or to express personal opinions, often pasted on walls.\n⁴ A slang term referring to a cute young girl, often used in a slightly informal or affectionate context.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang's shop was currently closed, though not entirely; the roller shutter was half-lowered, and Bai Yingying was sitting inside playing a game.\n\nZhou Ze had heard that in the game called \"Eat Chicken\"*, there seemed to be many cheats; there, cheats were called \"Immortals,\" and because cheats were rampant, this game also had the nickname \"Battle of Slaying (All) Immortals.\"\n\nBut looking at Bai Yingying, who was already engrossed in it, Zhou Ze suddenly felt very sorry for the players of this game, because they might not even know that in this game, their opponents were not only \"Immortals\" using cheats, but also real zombies!\n\nXu Qinglang should have gone to look for a new shop location, and Zhou Ze also decided to look for one too. If there wasn't enough money, he would temporarily borrow from Xu Qinglang. Furthermore, the girl who gave him her business card last time had also mentioned the idea of investing.\n\nIn short, if he put down his so-called integrity, money was still very easy to raise or borrow.\n\nThis place was truly uninhabitable anymore. Maybe after a while longer, it wouldn't just be taxi drivers; Zhou Ze might see a bus pull up at the entrance while sitting in the shop.\n\nA director led a group of tourists off the bus, and the tour guide, holding a megaphone and waving a small flag, explained:\n\n\"Fellow travelers, fellow travelers, we have arrived at our next scenic spot.\n\nTongcheng has Lang Mountain, known as one of the Ten Lesser Buddhist Mountains, but Tongcheng also has 'Late Night Bookstore,' known as one of the Top Ten Supernatural Tourist Destinations in the country.\n\nThis place is very dangerous; people often die here inexplicably, and people often see dead people appearing here. Everyone, do not get too close; just take photos outside as a souvenir.\n\nAbsolutely do not photograph yourselves in it, just like you shouldn't take photos with the Terracotta Warriors at Qin Shi Huang's Mausoleum; those are funerary objects, things used for the dead, it's unlucky to take photos with them!\"\n\nZhou Ze felt that day might truly not be far off. The last group from the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association who came here to commit suicide came because they heard rumors about this place, and then, the suicide-pact of two of them added a special atmosphere to this place.\n\nPushing open the bookstore door and walking into the bookstore, Zhou Ze saw the Old Daoist sitting there dozing off. The Old Daoist's live stream hadn't been on for a long time.\n\nJust as you can't be sure if the person playing games with you is a \"Big Dick Loli\" or a zombie,\n\nyou also can't be sure whether all the people watching the live stream are alive.\n\nIn fact, among the online viewership of major live streaming platforms, the number of living people indeed only accounted for a very small portion.\n\nThe Old Daoist had been lying low for a long time; now, he merely guarded the woman named Tang Shi, not inseparable, but already very responsible.\n\n\"Boss, you're back.\"\n\nZhou Ze's footsteps woke the Old Daoist, and the Old Daoist wiped the drool from the corner of his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and directly went upstairs to the second floor.\n\nTang Shi still looked like a mummy, but her recovery was truly good. When Zhou Ze came up, she was opening her eyes as if looking at the ceiling, and at the same time, water and White Rabbit milk candy were placed beside her.\n\nShe didn't need people to serve her food and clothes; she could manage herself with a kind of ability similar to \"telekinesis.\"\n\nWhen Zhou Ze came over, a White Rabbit milk candy peeled itself and actively flew to Zhou Ze's mouth. Zhou Ze opened his mouth and held the candy in it.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze sat down next to Tang Shi.\n\nThe two of them, neither spoke, nor had anything to say. They just spent half an hour very quietly like this. Zhou Ze stood up, preparing to go down.\n\nTang Shi spoke, \"Did you go to a psychiatrist?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"It wasn't useful, was it?\"\n\n\"It was still a bit useful,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nHowever, he was still unwilling to eat Wang Ke's family's meat soup.\n\n\"Mm.\" Tang Shi closed her eyes, as if tired, but still insisted on speaking, \"Help me call that zombie up.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, preparing to go down.\n\n\"Are you trying to trick me again?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"You caught me.\" Zhou Ze didn't feel embarrassed. \"I don't really like lending out pillows I'm used to sleeping on.\"\n\n\"But not being able to rest has a significant impact on my recovery.\"\n\n\"What does that have to do with me? I've done what I should do. If you want to get more from me, you'll have to offer more things worth exchanging.\"\n\n\"I can tell you the location of another Soul Messenger in Tongcheng.\" Tang Shi looked at Zhou Ze, \"Before, when the Old Daoist brought me to escape, I originally thought of hiding there, but unfortunately, he seemed to have some problems, which is why I eventually chose to come to your side.\"\n\n\"That doesn't seem to have much value to me.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"According to common speculation, Tongcheng is just a small city. It's enough to have one Soul Messenger; it's impossible for there to be two. So, the other one should have been replaced. You can go and see there, perhaps you can inherit some legacy.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained unmoved. \"I'm still not interested.\"\n\nIf it could be inherited, wouldn't the little loli do it herself?\n\nZhou Ze would not believe the little loli was someone who cherished old ties, especially the matter of that driver being scared to death in a car accident by her; there was still no definite conclusion to it.\n\n\"Then I have nothing else to give you.\"\n\n\"Then let's leave it at that for now.\"\n\nZhou Ze went downstairs, didn't go to call Bai Yingying, just as he said, lending out a pillow he was used to sleeping on to others would make him feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"Boss, what should we eat tonight?\" The Old Daoist pointed to next door, \"The boss next door doesn't seem to be back yet.\"\n\n\"You figure it out. Can you cook?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then go to his kitchen, find ingredients yourself and cook.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze sat down behind the counter.\n\nThe Old Daoist went to cook next door, and the bookstore immediately became quiet.\n\nHowever, not long after, a figure appeared at the bookstore's entrance; it was a girl, wearing a black jacket, wearing a scarf, and wrapped up tightly.\n\nAlthough Tongcheng had experienced some cooling recently, it wasn't to the extent of dressing like that.\n\nThe girl looked at Zhou Ze through the glass door, but Zhou Ze didn't pay attention to her.\n\nFinally, the girl pushed open the door and walked in. She came before Zhou Ze, stood still, took off her scarf, and pleaded:\n\n\"Help me.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his teacup, took a sip of water, and still didn't pay attention to her.\n\n\"Please, help me.\" The girl squatted down in front of Zhou Ze, supporting herself on Zhou Ze's thighs with both hands. \"As long as you're willing to help me, I'll do anything you ask.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the girl's nimble, fair hands even tried to provoke the man in front of her.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed the girl's wrist, pushed back slightly with force, and the girl sat on the ground, a bit bewildered.\n\nPutting down his book, Zhou Ze said somewhat surprisingly, \"I thought you'd be in there.\"\n\nYes, Zhou Ze had originally thought this girl would face some repercussions after the incident of slandering her teacher was exposed, but now it seemed she truly hadn't.\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, Zhou Ze understood. The girl was a minor, plus the teacher had committed suicide. Even if she was charged with slander, in the end, they would still smooth things over out of consideration for her being a minor.\n\n\"Did you see the news? My biological parents found me to make me save my so-called younger brother.\"\n\nAs the girl said this, a hint of malice flashed in her eyes.\n\nShe was never a good person†; even if her middle school teacher committed suicide because of her slander, she still lived happily.\n\nAnd so, for these suddenly emerging so-called biological parents—it would have been fine if they were rich, with luxury homes, villas, and huge inheritances for her to inherit, but it turned out they were biological parents from an ordinary family, which wasn't very meaningful.\n\nWhat's more, the purpose of her biological parents finding her was to make her donate to save her younger brother.\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nDid their brains get water in them‡!\n\n\"You're very familiar with Lin Yi, you should know clearly that I'm just a live-in son-in-law, with no money and no ability, only able to guard this unprofitable bookstore. I am powerless to help.\"\n\n\"I'd like to ask you, like last time when you came to my house, to go to my biological parents' house.\"\n\nThe girl bit her lip. As she spoke these words, that scene from that night seemed to reappear in her mind; she was terrified, truly so scared that she couldn't recover for several days.\n\n\"Oh, just that?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, that's all. Make them stop disturbing me, stop bothering me.\" The girl affirmed.\n\n\"To be honest, when I saw the news before, I thought that second daughter was very pitiful, truly very pitiful. Those biological parents, they're truly not a thing§.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are jackals, they are beasts, they are bastards!\" The girl said through gritted teeth.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head, looking at the girl still sitting on the ground. \"But when I found out that pitiful girl was actually you, I suddenly felt great.\"\n\n\"......\" The girl.\n\nBut the girl had, after all, seen 'wind and rain'¶; she could endure the unbearable and bizarre fetishes of those old men in bed, which was enough to show her resilience.\n\nIn fact, she was like a flower blooming in a pile of weeds outside the window, constantly experiencing the wind and rain, and the constant nourishment of dew on her pistils,\n\nand indeed much, much stronger than a pistil in a greenhouse.\n\n\"I can make you feel even better.\"\n\nThe girl looked at Zhou Ze, \"As long as you can help me, like last time when you were at my house.\"\n\n\"Do you think Lin Yi is pretty?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n\"This... she's very pretty.\"\n\n\"How does she compare to you?\"\n\n\"She's a bit prettier than me,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"Then I can tell you, her older sister is prettier and has more temperament than her, and can wear a white lab coat uniform. And furthermore, she's also a... a gentle woman. So, please tell me, why would I fancy you?\"\n\nZhou Ze originally wanted to say Doctor Lin was still a virgin, but suddenly felt saying that seemed a bit off, so he changed his words.\n\n\"Help me, otherwise, I'll die in your bookstore!\"\n\nA small knife suddenly appeared in the girl's hand, pointed at her own neck.\n\n\"Heh heh, feel free. I couldn't wish for anything more. I just need kar...\"\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nThe small knife directly pierced the girl's neck,\n\nvery abruptly,\n\nvery cleanly,\n\neven too abruptly, and too cleanly!\n\nBlood splattered onto Zhou Ze's face, making Zhou Ze momentarily stunned.\n\nThe girl's eyes were wide open, her face full of disbelief, and then her body slowly fell backward.\n\nZhou Ze abruptly stood up and roared upstairs:\n\n\"What the fu—, what are you doing!\"\n\n---\n*   \"Eat Chicken\" (吃雞) is a common nickname for the video game *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* (PUBG) in Chinese, referring to the winner's message \"Winner winner chicken dinner.\"\n†   \"not a good person\" (不是什麼好鳥): Literally \"not a good bird,\" an idiom meaning someone is not a good person.\n‡   \"Did their brains get water in them?\" (腦子進水了吧): An idiom meaning someone is out of their mind or has a foolish idea.\n§   \"not a thing\" (真不是個東西): An idiom meaning someone is despicable, worthless, or not a good person.\n¶   \"seen 'wind and rain'\" (見過風雨): An idiom meaning to have experienced many hardships or difficulties in life.",

    "content": "\"What the f*** are you doing!\"\n\nZhou Ze was asking Tang Shi.\n\nIt was obvious that the girl had previously said, \"Ah, if you don't help me, I'll die right in front of you!\"\n\nIn reality, she was just saying it, just like a class teacher always tells their students, \"You're the worst class I've ever taught!\"\n\nIn fact, he said that every year; you really couldn't take it seriously.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't expected her to actually commit suicide, and a woman like her wouldn't possibly commit suicide. She cherished herself so much; how could she kill herself?\n\nYet, she abruptly, without even a second threat, or even a chance to produce tears, stabbed herself in the neck with a small knife.\n\nEspecially her astonished expression at this moment, which further indicated that even she, the person involved, was in a state of utter bewilderment.\n\nWho am I?\nWhere am I?\nOh my god, I actually committed suicide!\n\nThere was only one explanation left: someone controlled her knife, making her \"commit suicide,\" and the person capable of doing this was upstairs from him.\n\nPerhaps the murderer still had a White Rabbit candy* in their mouth.\n\n\"What's wrong! What's wrong!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist, who was cooking next door, heard Zhou Ze's shout and immediately ran back. Seeing the girl collapsed on the ground, he was instantly startled.\n\n\"Oh my god, little girl, what happened to you!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist immediately went over, preparing to save her.\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, went straight upstairs. He saw Tang Shi still lying on the mat.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"Calm down.\" Tang Shi smiled. Her body still couldn't move; at the moment, she could only speak and smile. \"Now, can your maid come up and sleep with me?\"\n\n\"Are you trying to kill me!\" Zhou Ze demanded.\n\nTang Shi was slightly surprised. \"Shouldn't you be thanking me?\"\n\n\"Thank you for what, ghost!\" Zhou Ze kicked over the teacup in front of him. The water spilled everywhere, and the cup flew to the wall and shattered.\n\n\"I don't believe you didn't see it; otherwise, how could you not perform first aid? You're a doctor; saving people should be your instinct!\n\nYou didn't directly perform first aid; instead, you came up here to question me. Are you trying to renege and play dumb?\"\n\nTang Shi said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Precisely because I, your father, saw through it, I couldn't acknowledge her. Do you know who gave me the mark on my hand? Do you know whose side that Faceless Woman is truly on now!\n\nDo you know who led other ghost couriers to release her, specifically to cause trouble for your family's person in Rongcheng?\n\nDo you think you're very capable? Do you think you're very smart?\n\nDo you think everyone else is drunk, but you alone are sober!\n\nAs soon as you made a move, didn't you directly tell her you were here with me?\"\n\nTang Shi fell silent. She suddenly felt a little embarrassed, and a little ashamed.\n\nIt seemed that Zhou Ze had actually seen through it long ago. He was deliberately feigning compliance, while she, in her self-proclaimed cleverness, had intervened and pushed the situation into an unpredictable abyss.\n\n\"Oh my, oh my, don't cling to me, don't cling to me! I can't breathe!!!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist's shouts came from downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze cast a deep gaze at Tang Shi, who was still lying motionless, then shook his head,\n\n\"Stupid woman.\"\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze went downstairs and saw the Old Taoist in the bookstore, wrapped in bundles of hair, like a large black zongzi, while the girl who had collapsed was nowhere to be seen.\n\nZhou Ze's fingers grew nails, and he walked over and directly clawed at the hair.\n\n\"Whoosh! Whoosh!\"\n\nThe hair snapped at his touch and floated away.\n\nBut the remaining hair on the ground intertwined to form a human face, like an ink wash painting, very beautiful and classic, though upon closer inspection, one could see that the face didn't have clearly defined facial features.\n\n\"Object control, is that your new ability?\"\n\nA woman's voice echoed from all around the bookstore, empty and vast, as if a chant from hell.\n\n\"Or perhaps, I've made a new discovery? A most unexpected one?\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman seemed to be talking to herself; in reality, she was demonstrating, a show of force, having caught her enemy's weakness.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had always been unclear why the Faceless Woman hated him so much. Was it merely because he had scratched her with his nails in the hellish pond?\n\nOr perhaps she had other motives concerning him, such as her hysterical, unwilling roar when he left hell.\n\nBut any normal person would feel enraged by such unprovoked sneak attacks.\n\nEarlier, Zhou Ze had indeed seen through it, because everything had been too smooth, too natural.\n\nThe clues connected, leading to this girl. She appeared before him in the most appropriate manner and for the most appropriate reason, almost seamlessly integrating with his previous life and trajectory.\n\nThere was no abruptness, yet it was the greatest abruptness. She pursued perfection too much, and was too deliberate. With her previous attempt to impersonate Doctor Lin as a precedent, it would be difficult for Zhou Ze to fall for another inexplicable trick.\n\nOf course, most importantly, Zhou Ze didn't believe that girl, after seeing him in that state last time, would still dare to appear before him, still dare to act seductively, and still dare to ask for his help.\n\nLast time, she had indeed tried to use a honey trap on him, but he had coldly rejected her. Did she think she was Yang Guifei? And she tried again?\n\nIn fact, thinking calmly, the Faceless Woman had revealed many flaws when she impersonated Doctor Lin last time, but at that moment, Zhou Ze had just learned about Xu Le's attempt to hire assassins to kill him and was in a state of mental disarray, so she seized the opportunity.\n\nOverall, the Faceless Woman was an anomaly formed by the convergence of countless resentments from the deceased on the Yellow Springs Road; she was not human.\n\nHow many tricks can a beast play? It merely provides a laugh.\n\n\"You're finished. I'll let her know what you're doing. Don't forget, your current identity was given by her.\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman's voice carried obvious schadenfreude, like a kindergarten child who had caught a peer's wrongdoing and was going to tell the teacher.\n\nIt was at this moment that Zhou Ze suddenly noticed water droplets on the ground floating up and adhering to the glass door frame.\n\n\"This is just her clone puppet. If we leave her behind, what happened here won't be known.\"\n\nThis was Tang Shi's warning, perhaps also her paying the price for her recent self-important impulse. Instantly, the surrounding water droplets began to surge, shooting directly towards the hair on the ground.\n\nThe Faceless Woman also saw the words. She let out a piercing shriek, her hair gathered together, and a chilling wind swept in, rushing directly towards the door.\n\nHowever, the mist Tang Shi conjured at this moment acted like a membrane, slowing down the movement of the mass of hair.\n\nBai Yingying also sensed something was wrong at this time, ran over from next door, and seeing the scene in the bookstore, slightly opened her mouth, somewhat confused.\n\n\"Trying to stop me?\" The Faceless Woman let out a disdainful cry, \"Let's see how you stop me!\"\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe hair that had been gathered together suddenly burst apart. For a moment, the bookstore seemed to have turned into a barbershop, with countless strands of hair darting in all directions.\n\nSome tried to go to the ventilation ducts, some to the second floor, and others tried to go into the restroom to enter the sewer.\n\nJust one strand of hair getting out could transmit the news here to the main body, and then Zhou Ze's hiding of a \"fugitive\" would be exposed.\n\nZhou Ze's nails waved incessantly in the air. Strand after strand of hair, once caught by him, directly turned into ashes and dissipated.\n\nThe Old Taoist once again reached into his trousers, pulled out two talismans, and waved them wildly in the air. Any hair that touched the talismans stuck to them, like flypaper, proving very effective.\n\nA practice book directly disintegrated, sheets of paper flew out like curved blades sweeping horizontally. Strand after strand of hair was cut, withering directly upon landing.\n\nTang Shi, lying on the second floor, coughed, and fresh blood spilled from the corner of her mouth. She was already injured, but she knew that at this moment, she absolutely couldn't hold back.\n\nBai Yingying was quick-witted, her hands constantly reaching out. Each time, she managed to pinch a strand of hair, grabbing it and directly tearing it off.\n\nThe originally quiet bookstore, which usually had almost no business, now began a grand and fervent cleanup, as if a leader was about to arrive for inspection.\n\nFinally, everything seemed to settle. The Faceless Woman let out a last, unwilling roar, and not a single strand of hair could be seen.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a plastic stool. The bloodstains on his face had long since disappeared, because nothing of this, except the hair, was real.\n\n\"Boss, we're done. I'm exhausted.\" The Old Taoist slumped to the ground, panting heavily.\n\nBai Yingying, on the other hand, poured Zhou Ze a cup of tea. She didn't seem tired. \"Boss, is it that one from last time again?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took the tea, and drank a sip.\n\n\"She's taken a fancy to you, huh? Quite persistent.\" Bai Yingying stuck out her tongue.\n\nZhou Ze said nothing, but his mood was heavy. The Faceless Woman wasn't a huge problem, but she made you restless. No one wanted to be targeted by such an opponent.\n\nAccording to her, her main body had gone to Rongcheng with the little loli, leaving a few strands of hair as a puppet to target him.\n\nEven if the targeting wasn't successful, she'd come to disgust him!\n\nSuch a petty enemy was truly maddening.\n\nNow, Zhou Ze's only thought was that the person in Rongcheng had better deal with both the little loli and the Faceless Woman, and incidentally, flush all his troubles down the toilet, leaving nothing behind.\n\nAlthough this was quite difficult, one must always have dreams.\n\nIn a subtle spot no one noticed, a strand of hair stealthily moved out from a magazine gap, then fell to the ground, and finally drifted towards the door crack.\n\n\"Creak!\"\n\nThe glass door was pushed open,\n\nand the hair happened to be stepped on by a leather shoe.\n\nXu Qinglang bent down, picked up the strand of hair, and then directly snapped it,\n\nIn the void, it seemed a woman's final roar of utter failure echoed!\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment, as if hearing someone curse him,\n\nbut then immediately angrily pointed at Zhou Ze, who was sitting inside, and roared:\n\n\"Alright, here I am, running around outside in such cold weather, looking for a new shop address, and what about you? Look at this hair,\n\nhas another beautiful female reader come into the shop to chat with you?\"\n\nThe implication was,\n\n\"This old lady is running around for our future,\n\nand you're hiding in the shop, enjoying the air conditioning and flirting with long-haired girls!\"\n\n\"Do you deserve me?!\"\n\n---\n**Footnote:**\n*   **White Rabbit candy**: A popular brand of milk candy from China.",

    "content": "「Are you asleep?」\n\n「No.」\n\n「Didn't you call me here to sleep with you?」\n\n「Can't sleep.」\n\n「Oh.」\n\n「How long have you lived?」\n\n「Two hundred years. But I've spent most of that time lying in a coffin. Actually, if you count it up, the time I've genuinely spent living outside is less than twenty years.」\n\n「What do you think of your boss?」\n\n「Not much. He's very petty.」\n\n「I think so too.」\n\n「Did he scold you today?」\n\n「I was wrong.」\n\n「Oh.」\n\n「Actually, I've always been curious, what kind of person is the boss, and that other person you often talk about?」\n\n「What kind of person?」\n\n「Hmm.」\n\n「Let's put it this way: if he and your boss swapped places yesterday, he wouldn't need to wait for me to act. He'd kill that puppet himself, wouldn't be afraid of exposing anything, and wouldn't come up to ask me about meddling.」\n\n「Oh, I see.」 Bai Yingying pondered for a moment, then said, 「Someone like that wouldn't live long, right?」\n\nTang Shi fell silent.\n\n「Actually, the boss has many flaws. Sometimes he's not manly enough, and he's always overcautious when doing things, constantly calculating after they're done. But overall, he's actually fine. Everyone has their own different life, and naturally, their own different personality. He likes to be a bit cautious, like a squirrel, who enjoys bringing things home, savors the feeling of accumulation, and protects that feeling. Because he used to be from an orphanage, he originally had nothing.」\n\n「You understand him?」\n\n「I wouldn't say I understand him, but honestly, I don't want to become like you are now. I like playing on my phone every day, playing games, watching movies, enjoying my current life, making up for the regret of lying in a coffin for two hundred years. The boss is still indulgent and accommodating towards me in that regard.」\n\n「Is a life without ambition, without waves, interesting?」\n\n「Not everyone longs for waves and passion. Everyone should have their own way of life, as long as they like it. To be honest, sometimes I can see the boss himself holding back. I'm also very worried that the boss won't be able to hold back and will become like you and that person you mentioned.」\n\n「Scared?」\n\n「Yes, scared.」\n\n「Someone who has died once, what else is there to be afraid of? What else is there to fear? He's not to my taste. He looks very peaceful and refined, but deep down, he's full of petty, self-serving individualism, only thinking of himself. To put it bluntly, he's selfish.」\n\n「The boss is alright.」\n\n「You disagree?」\n\n「I disagree. I know that when my Mistress, having completed her merits, went to hell and handed me over to the boss, she must have told him to dispose of me. But the boss never did. Also, I know that because I'm in the shop, far fewer ghosts come here, but the boss still hasn't chased me away.」\n\n「That's because he treats you like a pillow. He wants to sleep soundly at night.」\n\n「Isn't someone who's willing to sacrifice performance for sleep quality good?」\n\nHearing that,\n\nTang Shi was momentarily stunned.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nThe image of that person who liked to sit on a chair in front of the underworld shop, basking in the sun, surfaced in her mind.\n\nSunlight spilled over him,\n\nLike an old grandfather.\n\n………………\n\nRegardless of the Faceless Woman's problem, it was at least temporarily resolved. Now, they just needed to wait for the final result from Rongcheng.\n\nOf course, this matter could wait, but the moving could not. Xu Qinglang had found a new address near South Street in the center of Tongcheng City, considered the commercial hub in the hearts of old Tongcheng residents, with very high foot traffic.\n\nYesterday, Zhou Ze received an invitation to attend Miss Liu's memorial service. Zhou Ze wasn't sure why he was invited and originally didn't plan to go, but Xu Qinglang, upon seeing the sender, strongly insisted that Zhou Ze must attend, because the shop he was interested in was property of Miss Liu's family.\n\nDiscussing business with someone's family at their funeral seemed a bit improper, but adhering to the principle of saving money where possible, Zhou Ze still agreed.\n\nTaking a car according to the address on the invitation, Zhou Ze found that they weren't going to a funeral parlor, but were driving into a somewhat rural location. It was a villa built amidst fields.\n\nAt this time, it was the season for rapeseed flowers to bloom, and the villa, nestled within the sea of flowers, gave off a very serene and somewhat cold feeling.\n\nNot many people came; only four or five cars were parked at the entrance.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze got out of the car and walked in, he saw Cui Yilang and several other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association standing in the courtyard, chatting in low voices.\n\nNo one greeted Zhou Ze, nor did anyone come to collect condolence money. A few scattered groups of people were there, as if on a spring outing.\n\nThe exterior of this house looked no different from a three-story rural residence built by a local family near Tongcheng, but upon entering, one discovered that the interior was entirely decorated in a Western European style.\n\nFrom the rafters to the coffee tables and teacups, it made one feel as if they had stumbled into the backdrop of a British drama.\n\nMusic began to play at this moment; it wasn't the usual \"dirge,\" but Chopin's \"Farewell Waltz.\" Although it spoke of parting, the melody was much livelier than domestic dirges.\n\nSeveral women dressed in black veils came down from upstairs. These were the hosts.\n\nA man resembling a priest, holding a Bible, walked to the center.\n\nEveryone gathered around, sharing in the sorrow.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a cup of coffee at the self-service counter nearby and sipped it slowly.\n\nIn modern times, funerary customs in China have undergone several reforms, one might even say upheavals, and earth burials have long been prohibited in most regions.\n\nIn rural areas, funerals usually involve setting up a canopy in front of one's own courtyard and managing everything there. In cities, some might arrange something within their own residential compound or simply rent a venue at a funeral parlor.\n\nThis was the first time Zhou Ze had encountered such a Western-style funeral.\n\nZhou Ze remembered hearing someone say that in some Western countries, there were many family-run \"funeral workshops,\" where the first floor of their own home served as both a living space and a rented venue for memorial services, while also providing services such as corpse retrieval and cosmetology for the deceased.\n\nLooking at this place now, it seemed to adopt a similar style, but in China, most people would still find it unacceptable.\n\nWhen it was time to pay respects to the deceased, everyone lined up and went one by one. If you had a good relationship, you could hold the coffin lid and speak. If the relationship was distant, you would walk past, sigh, and put on a show.\n\nWhen it was Zhou Ze's turn, he glanced into the coffin and found Miss Liu lying neatly dressed in a black gown, truly looking as if she were asleep.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze was that Miss Liu had fallen from upstairs right in front of him. No matter how you embellished it with words, you couldn't hide the fact that her death was extremely gruesome. Yet, Miss Liu's appearance in death was exquisitely refined, with an exceptionally good restoration.\n\nThis couldn't help but remind Zhou Ze of the mortician who, when he died, impatiently applied makeup to him with a heavy hand, using an eyebrow pencil. He certainly hadn't received such treatment.\n\nThe deceased can't leave bad reviews; it's truly unfair.\n\nAfter paying respects to the deceased, everyone went to the side hall for dining. It was a buffet, but there wasn't much food, just some pastries and grilled sausages, serving merely as an afternoon tea snack to stave off hunger. It was impossible for anyone to feast lavishly here.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a glass of wine, drank some, and then left the side hall. He intended to find Miss Liu's family members to discuss the shop rental.\n\nXu Qinglang said he would lease it for a year first, and then Zhou Ze would pay him rent monthly. This was also out of consideration for Zhou Ze not being able to pay such a large sum upfront. Zhou Ze also had to return the favor, so if he could help negotiate the price, he would.\n\nHowever, after looking around, Zhou Ze couldn't find the family members who had previously worn black veils. Instead, he saw the priest standing at the stairwell, smoking.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked over, the priest offered him a cigarette.\n\nThe two men stood together, smoking.\n\nThe priest wasn't a foreigner; he was Chinese, probably around thirty years old, and looked quite young for his age.\n\nWithout much conversation, after finishing his cigarette, the priest walked away. Zhou Ze extinguished his cigarette butt and happened to notice what looked like another staircase leading downstairs beneath the main staircase.\n\nIt must be the basement.\n\nOrdinary Chinese families generally don't have basements. Driven by curiosity, Zhou Ze still walked downstairs and saw an elevator inside. Beside the elevator, there was also a metal door.\n\nThe door was open. Pushing it open and stepping inside, he immediately felt the temperature drop significantly.\n\nIn front of Zhou Ze were two steel slab beds and a freezer, similar to those in a hospital mortuary, but with some additional equipment.\n\nIt gave one the feeling that this was a slaughterhouse.\n\nWalking over to the steel slab bed, Zhou Ze reached out and touched it. This place must be for the deceased. Miss Liu must have also laid here to receive her final beauty treatment in life.\n\nThis place was the beauty salon for the deceased.\n\n「Sir, this area is not open to the public.」\n\nA young man in a gray suit stood at the doorway and spoke.\n\nZhou Ze nodded apologetically; he had been presumptuous.\n\n「Have we met somewhere before?」 Zhou Ze asked, feeling that the man looked familiar.\n\n「Perhaps. This is my business card. Of course, we hope you won't have cause to use the number on it.」\n\nThe young man handed Zhou Ze a business card.\n\nThe business card had the name 「Chen Zesheng」 written on it, with the remark 「Director of Tongcheng Western-style Funeral Parlor.」\n\n「Is business good?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\nFor a long time, others had been asking Zhou Ze 「how's business.」 Now, Zhou Ze finally had a chance to ask someone else.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze also knew that when others asked him 「how's business,」 what they were actually thinking was:\n\n「This idiot actually opened a crummy bookstore in this dilapidated place; business would be good only if hell froze over!」\n\n「It's a bit quiet. After all, not many people in China accept this kind of funeral custom,」 Chen Zesheng said with a wry smile.\n\n「Hmm.」\n\nZhou Ze finished asking and felt satisfied.\n\n「By the way, the deceased's family is on the second floor,」 Chen Zesheng reminded him.\n\n「Okay, thank you.」\n\nZhou Ze left the basement.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze started walking up the stairs, the hand holding the business card suddenly trembled. He lowered his head again and looked at the name on the card:\n\nChen Zesheng.\n\nIt seemed that,\n\nThe one who accompanied Miss Liu in a suicide pact the next day,\n\nAlso had the surname Chen?\n\n…………\n\nClosing the metal door,\n\nThe young man in the suit lay down on the steel slab bed.\n\nHe reached out and gently rubbed his right cheek. His skin was already wrinkled and cracked, with green shaping fluid oozing out from within.\n\nHe shook his head,\n\nAnd sighed:\n\n「As soon as I died, those two morticians at home started getting lazy.\n\nAt this rate, what will become of the business?」",

    "content": "Upon reaching the second floor, Zhou Ze saw Miss Liu's family. What was somewhat strange was that he saw no men, only three women.\n\nOne had white hair and was nearing old age; another was graceful and poised, middle-aged; the last was around Miss Liu's age.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked in, he noticed the priest was also there, speaking to the elderly woman, as if comforting her.\n\nThe old woman listened, and the priest spoke, everyone seemed to be just going through the motions, fulfilling their duty. To say there was much grief in the room would have been false.\n\nOf course, one cannot blame the living for their indifference to the dead, for the living must face the problem of how to continue living.\n\n\"Hello, may I ask if you are Ms. Liu Yanhua?\"\n\nZhou Ze approached the middle-aged woman and asked.\n\n\"Hello, I am.\"\n\nMs. Liu took out a handkerchief and dabbed the corners of her eyes.\n\nZhou Ze thought she seemed more like she was wiping sleep from her eyes than tears, as he really couldn't tell that she had cried.\n\nThe woman's collarbone was very distinct, her figure rather slender, and her forehead bone protruded, giving her a somewhat unsettling appearance.\n\nIn fact, this was the face of a woman said to bring misfortune to her husband.*\n\nCulture is a vehicle, a unit. In every era, any aspect of politics, economics, or even lowly things like feng shui masters, are influenced by culture.\n\nFor instance, in ancient times, there was the saying of \"husband-killer,\" which was a typical example of treating women as appendages to a patriarchal society. This was a very unfair and erroneous conclusion.\n\nZhou Ze didn't believe in this originally, even though he was a ghost.\n\nBut thinking about it,\n\nThree generations of one family,\n\nNot a single male descendant,\n\nIt would be quite difficult not to believe it.\n\nZhou Ze explained his purpose. Xu Qinglang had already communicated with her before, reaching a preliminary agreement, but they hadn't progressed to discussing the specific price.\n\n\"Mr. Zhou, thank you for coming to my daughter's funeral. I thank you on her behalf. As for that shop, since Mr. Zhou has taken a liking to it, please think of a figure for the rent when you return. As long as it's not too outrageous, I won't refuse.\"\n\nSo easygoing?\n\nZhou Ze was愣了一下, taken aback. In his previous life, he was a doctor and hadn't done much business, so he was a bit unaccustomed to negotiating prices for the first time. But Ms. Liu appeared very generous.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, exchanged a few comforting platitudes, then turned and discreetly left. All that remained was to discuss a price with Xu Qinglang and send it over, and the matter would be almost settled.\n\nHe walked down the stairs and reached the same corner again. Zhou Ze approached the metal door once more, reached out to push it, and found it locked.\n\nZhou Ze knocked on the door.\n\nNo one responded inside.\n\nIt was frustrating,\n\nAnd perplexing,\n\nAs a ghost official,\n\nTo be stopped by a door or a wall, this ghost official seemed to be losing too much face.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze couldn't be like that little girl,\n\n\"Biu,\"\n\nHe's out,\n\n\"Biu,\"\n\nHe's in again.\n\nThis door, Zhou Ze really couldn't open it.\n\nReturning to the main hall, most of the mourners had left, and the hall was being tidied up. The coffin was also being carried away. As for Miss Liu, she would likely be sent to the crematorium soon for cremation.\n\nWhen a person dies, it's like a lamp going out, ultimately becoming a mound of earth.\n\nFunerals always tend to evoke such melancholic emotions.\n\nZhou Ze stopped a cleaning lady and asked, \"Excuse me, do you know Chen Zesheng?\"\n\n\"Ah, he was the previous owner here,\" the cleaning lady replied with a slight surprise. \"He's already dead; the funeral was yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded, then asked, \"May I ask who your current boss is?\"\n\n\"It's the previous owner's younger brother; he just went down to the basement,\" the cleaning lady replied. Then, worried Zhou Ze wouldn't understand, she explained, \"You know, that place by the staircase, specifically for preparing the deceased's appearance.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked back to the metal door.\n\nHe had to get in,\n\nAnd catch that lively clown who, after dying, still managed to shove a postcard into a ghost official's hand, for whatever reason.\n\nBut this door,\n\nHow exactly was he supposed to open it?\n\nHe knocked forcefully a few times,\n\nThe door remained still, and there was no response from inside.\n\nThe cleaning lady had just said their current boss had gone in, which obviously seemed off. Of course, Zhou Ze wasn't concerned if something happened to the current boss inside; he wasn't that benevolent.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to look for a tool to try and pry open the door,\n\nHe saw the door open,\n\nAnd a young man stood inside, dressed in a black suit with a white flower pinned to his chest.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" the young man asked.\n\nThis wasn't the one who had just shoved a postcard into his hand. Presumably, it was the current boss, Chen Zesheng's biological younger brother.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to talk to you about, regarding your brother,\" Zhou Ze said. He had already decided that if this guy couldn't be reasoned with, he'd just knock him out first and then go in to find Chen Zesheng.\n\n\"Oh, alright, please come in.\"\n\nThe man seemed very easy to talk to, and directly gestured for Zhou Ze to enter.\n\nZhou Ze gave the man a deep look, then walked inside.\n\nThe two steel slabs were still in their original positions, and the freezer cabinets were also there.\n\n\"Where is your brother's body?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My brother's funeral was held yesterday, sir. Are you a friend of my brother's?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" Zhou Ze prevaricated.\n\n\"My brother's body was cremated yesterday.\"\n\nAre you trying to fool a ghost?\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he understood, then turned and left.\n\nThe man in the suit watched Zhou Ze's retreating back, a hint of deep thought in his eyes.\n\n***\n\nThe evening breeze was cool, and the rapeseed flowers around the villa, under the moonlight, created a desolate atmosphere, like a grand funeral, with everything here serving as adornment and preparation.\n\nThe workers had all gone home. This place did not provide accommodation, even though it was large and spacious. Of course, the workers didn't want to live here anyway.\n\nThe man in the black suit arranged dishes on the round table in the hall. They were all cold dishes, without any warmth.\n\nThen he poured wine into the glasses on the table; it was aged yellow wine.\n\nImmediately, he walked to the stairwell and called upstairs:\n\n\"Dinner is ready.\"\n\nThree women,\n\nFrom young to old, descended the stairs in sequence. They didn't stand on ceremony; they took their seats directly.\n\nThe priest hadn't left either; he stood by the table.\n\nThe man in the suit went to the basement again and pushed out a stretcher trolley from inside, covered with a white sheet. Then came the second, third, and fourth trolleys.\n\nIn the hall, a strong smell of plastic and disinfectant began to permeate.\n\nThe elderly woman started coughing,\n\nThe middle-aged woman's expression was displeased,\n\nThe younger woman covered her nose and waved her hand.\n\n\"Why are there so many people?\" Ms. Liu asked, dissatisfied.\n\n\"Since we agreed to hold a ghost marriage for my brother and sister-in-law, it only feels proper to invite my father and mother to participate as well.\"\n\n\"Your family is truly twisted,\" the elderly woman muttered. \"No wonder your brother instigated my granddaughter to jump off the building with him.\"\n\n\"This matter isn't my brother's fault. My brother always managed the family business; he didn't want to die. It's your family that has a tradition of men committing suicide. My sister-in-law, influenced by her upbringing, took my brother with her to commit suicide.\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The elderly woman was too tired to argue. She urged, \"If you're going to do it, hurry up. I'm feeling a bit sleepy.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe man in the suit first lifted the white sheet from one stretcher trolley, revealing Miss Liu's corpse.\n\nHe picked up Miss Liu and placed her in a chair, then used several plastic ties to secure her there, ensuring she maintained a dignified sitting posture.\n\nAfterward, the man in the suit lifted the white sheet from his brother, picked him up, and seated him beside Miss Liu.\n\nHowever, his brother's sitting posture seemed to be well-maintained and didn't require ties to secure it.\n\nThe man in the suit was somewhat surprised but didn't pay it too much mind.\n\n\"Oh, you poor unfortunate souls, why did it have to be this way?\"\n\nThe old woman squeezed out a few tears. What an effort.\n\nMs. Liu comforted her mother,\n\nAnd Ms. Liu's daughter comforted her mother,\n\nThe three women huddled together, crying, comforting, and recounting their sorrows.\n\nThe new couple sat coldly in their seats,\n\nTheir eyelids tightly closed,\n\nThey couldn't see.\n\nThis table of dishes was prepared for them,\n\nBut this table of drama had nothing to do with them.\n\nThe man in the suit fastened red flowers onto the chests of his brother and sister-in-law, hoping to make them look more festive, but it only gave them a colder aesthetic.\n\n\"Don't open their eyes; don't disturb them too much.\"\n\nMs. Liu saw the man in the suit about to use tape to prop open the corpses' eyelids and immediately stopped him.\n\nShe had already overcome a great psychological barrier just by agreeing to the ghost marriage. Now, sitting at the same table with two corpses made her feel on pins and needles. If the corpses' eyes were to open, she really wouldn't be able to stay.\n\nThe man in the suit paused, but then nodded in agreement.\n\nImmediately, the man in the suit called out to another stretcher trolley:\n\n\"Mom, it's brother's happy day today; please come and take a look.\"\n\nWith that, the man in the suit lifted the white sheet, revealing the corpse of a middle-aged woman.\n\nShe was wearing a qipao, looking wealthy and dignified, but she must have been dead for many years. Even the best preservation measures couldn't completely restore her appearance.\n\nBeneath her skin, a greenish sheen had already appeared. This was merely a shell, a shell that had undergone too many special treatments to preserve its living appearance as much as possible.\n\nHe placed his mother in a chair, seating her next to the old woman.\n\nThe old woman shuddered in fright but said nothing.\n\nMs. Liu glanced at her \"in-law\" and dared not look a second time.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe man in the suit turned to the last stretcher trolley and said:\n\n\"Dad, brother is getting married today; please wake up...\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nA response came from beneath the white sheet.\n\nThe man in the suit's body trembled, and a look of horror appeared on his face.\n\nThe three women at the table also began to tremble in fear. The young girl almost shrieked but quickly covered her mouth.\n\nEven the priest raised his head in suspicion, truly bewildered, wondering what act this was.\n\nThe man in the suit dared not reach out to lift the white sheet again,\n\nBut the person inside actively lifted the white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, moved his neck, producing a few crisp cracks, and apologized somewhat:\n\n\"Sorry, my pillow was monopolized by a stupid woman today, so I just borrowed your freezer for a nap.\n\nIt wasn't bad,\n\nIt's just that I've been living too comfortably for too long, and sleeping in a freezer made my body feel a bit stiff.\"\n\n---\n*   \"克夫的面相\" (kèfū de miànxiàng): A concept in traditional Chinese physiognomy, implying that a woman's facial features bring misfortune, illness, or even death to her husband.

    "content": "「很 sorry，I'm sorry to interrupt your two families' gathering. I'm just here to take care of my business, and then you can continue.」\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze got off the stretcher, walked over to Chen Zesheng's corpse, reached out, and gently patted his shoulder. A black halo emerged, forming Chen Zesheng's shadow.\n\nThis shadow was only visible to Zhou Ze; ordinary people couldn't see it.\n\n「We haven't finished the wedding yet,」 Chen Zesheng said to Zhou Ze. He himself looked nonchalant, seemingly not at all surprised about being taken away by Zhou Ze.\n\n「Your wife is waiting for you down below.」\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze forcibly grabbed him and walked straight out.\n\n「You stop right there!」\n\nThe elder brother didn't refute anything, but the younger brother, mustering his courage, pointed at Zhou Ze and yelled:\n\n「What exactly are you going to do!」\n\n「What I needed to do, I've already done. Now, you may continue.」\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze specifically glanced at the priest standing silently beside the three women and smiled at him.\n\nThe priest also smiled at Zhou Ze, lowering his head even further.\n\nZhou Ze remembered the little loli once evaluating him like this: \"He really knows when to back off.\"\n\nNow it seemed, this priest understood even better than himself.\n\nWithout further words, Zhou Ze turned and left. The younger brother was still pointing at Zhou Ze, but he didn't dare to pursue him, because he clearly understood one thing: he himself had personally pushed the stretcher out of the freezer. This meant that the person in front of him had actually been lying in the freezer for a very long time.\n\nHe felt that this world must be mad, truly mad.\n\nClutching Chen Zesheng, he came out all the way to the road, flanked by lush rapeseed flowers.\n\nChen Zesheng then spoke, 「My lord, I came to ask for your help.」\n\n「Then why didn't you say so just now?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Because I noticed, My lord, that you didn't seem willing to help,」 Chen Zesheng said with a smile. 「My younger brother has some mental issues, and I'm a bit worried about him. Our family business was already not good, barely managing to survive. If I leave, he might not be able to bear it alone.」\n\n「I've certainly witnessed your younger brother having mental issues.」\n\nYes, indeed. A guy who can make a whole family, even the dead ones, stay together neat and tidy—it would be strange if he *were* mentally normal.\n\n「But you say you're worried your younger brother can't bear it alone, yet you were the one who jumped off the building earlier, weren't you?」 Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n「Heh heh, actually, I chickened out. We had agreed to jump together, but after she jumped, I got scared,」 Chen Zesheng said very honestly.\n\n「And then?」\n\n「Then I felt sorry for her, so the next day, after giving my statement at the police station, I jumped too.\n\nI originally thought I'd find her on the Yellow Springs Road, but inexplicably, I found myself back home again.\n\nPerhaps it was because my younger brother had restored my corpse too well. Although those two morticians had some issues with quality requirements, at least on the surface, they still restored me lifelike.」\n\nAfter Chen Zesheng finished speaking, he squatted down, and on his own accord, took out a cigarette and lit it.\n\nThis was a spirit cigarette, one burned for the afterlife; ordinary people couldn't smell the smoke.\n\nZhou Ze also took out a cigarette. Frankly speaking, Zhou Ze actually felt a certain fondness for this guy in front of him. He was straightforward in his actions and straightforward in his words.\n\nWhat a pity. A guy like this was already dead; otherwise, being friends with him would be quite comfortable.\n\n「Are you perhaps attracted by my personal charm?」 Chen Zesheng fluttered his eyelashes at Zhou Ze. 「People who know how to appreciate life and experience beauty are usually not too bad.」\n\n「For you to say that yourself, it's a bit nauseating.」\n\n「Heh heh, from the age of ten, my father started bringing me along. My younger brother was unwilling, afraid whenever he saw a corpse, so I was the only one who could inherit the craft.\n\nAt first, I was also afraid of corpses. Later, I discovered their beauty, a quiet beauty. This kind of beauty can make you immerse yourself in a certain emotion, like listening to a beautiful piano piece.\n\nI tended to their posthumous appearance, and they also tended to my emotions. I gave them their final dignity, and they gave me a moment of peace.\n\nActually, I still didn't want to die. If it weren't for her being determined to die, and if I truly liked her, I really wouldn't have wanted to die.」\n\n「I also regret that when I died, the mortician wasn't you.」\n\nThis was Zhou Ze's honest truth. The woman who did his makeup last time had stung him terribly.\n\n「Heh heh, My lord, may I ask you one more question? If I go down now, will I still be able to find her on the Yellow Springs Road? I'm a day late; I'm afraid I won't find her once I go down.」\n\n「Probably not. The Yellow Springs Road is very crowded.」\n\nOne thing he didn't say was that people on the Yellow Springs Road, with rare exceptions, mostly walk forward numbly on tiptoes, like soulless, formless walking corpses.\n\n「That's truly a pity,」 Chen Zesheng shook his head. 「I'll try my best to find her then.」\n\nZhou Ze pricked his palm with his fingernail, then drew out a square. Black light swirled within this square, and the aura of hell slowly diffused out.\n\n「Go on in. Go to where you belong.」\n\n「Thank you.」\n\nChen Zesheng walked up to the square, and his form was sucked inside.\n\nAshes to ashes, dust to dust. The Underworld has its order, and the Yellow Springs can be crossed. This was probably Zhou Ze's smoothest delivery of a person into hell.\n\nSilently finishing the cigarette, Zhou Ze turned his head and looked once more at the villa hidden among the rapeseed flowers, thinking about the expressions of the three women and the eerie scene of the living and the dead sitting together at the dining table.\n\nEven as a dead person, as an underworld envoy,\n\nZhou Ze still felt his scalp tingle at the behavior of those two families.\n\nDead people like Chen Zesheng could leave with ease and naturalness,\n\nWhile the living, on the other hand, were like clowns on a stage play, heavily made up, constantly preening and posing.\n\nThis world,\n\nIt seemed, had always been like this,\n\nAnd had never changed.\n\n…………\n\n「Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!」\n\nIt was already noon when Xu Qinglang's laughter came. He laughed exaggeratedly, as if he had picked up over a hundred thousand yuan. In fact, it was pretty close.\n\nZhou Ze had returned late last night and rested late, so he had only napped briefly on Bai Yingying's lap in the morning.\n\nHe hadn't slept for long before being woken by Xu Qinglang's laughter.\n\n「Old Zhou, you really are capable! Just now, the Liu family called me. They're renting that shop to us for fifty thousand yuan a year, fifty thousand yuan a year, on South Street! That's practically giving it away for free!」\n\n「Oh,」 Zhou Ze wasn't too surprised. He had gone ghost-catching last night, conveniently slept a bit, and stumbled upon the two families conducting a ghost marriage. This should be considered hush money for him.\n\n「Come on, let's go check out the shop.」\n\nJust like that, Zhou Ze was pulled by Xu Qinglang into a taxi to South Street. The shop was opposite South Street, facing Wen Feng Department Store and the Grand Department Store.\n\nThe shop covered an area of over a hundred square meters, and it used to be a clothing store.\n\n「Are you still planning to open a noodle shop?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Of course, I make delicious noodles!」\n\nXu Qinglang replied.\n\n「Then you go see if *their* noodles are good.」\n\nSaying that, Zhou Ze pointed to the shops on either side of theirs.\n\nXu Qinglang looked over, his face twitching. To the shop's left were \"Chongqing Noodles\" and \"Qishan Saozi Noodles,\" while to its right were \"Lanzhou Lamian\" and \"Wonton Noodle House.\"\n\n「Didn't you notice that when you looked at the shop earlier?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, looking utterly dejected.\n\n「We'll see then. You move your bookstore over first. If it really doesn't work out, I'll just make coffee and sell small pastries in the bookstore,」 Xu Qinglang said.\n\n「You had this planned all along, didn't you?」 Zhou Ze wasn't that easy to fool.\n\n「As a man with over twenty apartments,\n\nto let my hands and skin continue to be ravaged by cooking fumes—that's a crime!」\n\n「Then whose sign will it be?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Let's use your 'Late Night Bookstore' sign.」\n\n「That works.」\n\n「Are you hungry?」 Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze, simultaneously taking a thermos from his pocket. 「Let's go get some noodles. I want to see if the noodles here are good. If they're really bad, then I'll consider whether to challenge them.」\n\nThe thermos contained sour plum juice.\n\nZhou Ze didn't refuse; he hadn't eaten since getting up, so he followed Xu Qinglang into the Wonton Noodle House, ordered two bowls of noodles, and the two sat at a small table waiting for their noodles.\n\n「Ah, thinking about moving to this bustling downtown area to do business, I'm quite excited!」 Xu Qinglang looked impatient.\n\nThen he saw Zhou Ze didn't seem to be listening attentively to him, but instead slightly raised his head and looked up.\n\nThere was a ceiling fan directly overhead, spinning rapidly.\n\nThe temperature had clearly risen recently, and the sun was strong. Moreover, because the noodle shop's back kitchen was actually inside the shop with no partition, charcoal fire and steam lingered in the air, making it stuffy and unbearable without the electric fan.\n\n「What's so interesting about that?」 Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze.\n\n「When I was a kid in school, in summer, sitting in the classroom, I often looked up at these ceiling fans, afraid they would fall down and hit me,」 Zhou Ze said.\n\n「Hey, what a coincidence, I used to worry about that too when I was a kid.」\n\n「Oh right, can you read feng shui?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Half-baked,」 Xu Qinglang said without pretense, then continued, 「It's actually very simple: if you don't feel particularly comfortable living here, it means the feng shui isn't bad.」\n\nAnyway, you're a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment and found that Xu Qinglang's words made perfect sense; he couldn't even find a reason to refute them.\n\nTheir noodles arrived.\n\nXu Qinglang picked up a single noodle and ate it slowly.\n\nZhou Ze opened his thermos, took a sip of sour plum juice, then took a big bite of noodles.\n\nLooking at his own wolfing down food, then at Xu Qinglang's manner of eating noodle by noodle, Zhou Ze shook his head and said:\n\n「Affected.」\n\n「What do you know? I'm savoring the taste of my competitor.」\n\nUpon hearing that, Zhou Ze pushed away the noodles in front of him; he couldn't eat anymore.\n\n「............」 Xu Qinglang.\n\nJust then, a young man at the next table answered a phone call and said into the phone:\n\n「I'm at the Wonton Noodle House. I got here early. Have you arrived yet?」\n\nThe young man looked like a university student, very green.\n\nJust then, a girl carrying a shoulder bag ran to the shop entrance. She stood at the doorway, holding what looked like a notice, and excitedly called out to the young man:\n\n「I passed! I passed!」\n\nThen the girl ran straight toward the young man,\n\nopening her arms,\n\nasking for a hug.\n\n「I really envy university students' lives,」 Xu Qinglang said enviously.\n\nThe girl ran to the young man, directly jumped into his arms. The young man habitually caught her, then lifted the girl up. This seemed to be the customary way these two young lovers showed affection during their passionate romance.\n\nThis was the taste of youth,\n\nthe beauty of youth.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe ceiling fan was very low,\n\nAfter the boy habitually lifted the girl up,\n\nthe girl's head precisely hit the ceiling fan above.\n\n「Thump...」\n\nA head,\n\nlanded on the table in front of Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang.",

    "content": "The police arrived, and so did the ambulance;\n\nOf course, whether the ambulance came or not was already of little significance.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang squatted on the opposite side of the road, surrounded by a crowd of onlookers.\n\nXu Qinglang hadn’t quite recovered from the previous scene; his hands were still trembling. He wasn’t afraid of ghosts and often saw them, but many things couldn’t be measured by simple fear. It was about the vividness of the scene at the time, and whether it truly stimulated you.\n\nFor Xu Qinglang, who had just been relishing the thought of his competitor, the sudden change in atmosphere was truly stimulating.\n\n\"That was too terrifying.\"\n\nA moment later, Xu Qinglang finally came to his senses, lit a cigarette, and then asked:\n\n\"Can a ceiling fan really cut off someone's head?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"Theoretically speaking, it's impossible. At most, it would cause a cut.\"\n\n\"So this time it went beyond the theoretical scope?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. When I was a doctor, I did treat patients injured by falling ceiling fans, but I never heard of anyone actually having their head cut off by one. In fact, even ancient executioners had to practice their skills extensively to chop off a condemned prisoner's head with one stroke. Often, the blade would get stuck in the neck without the head falling off, and the blade couldn't be pulled out.\"\n\n\"Alright then, it seems the *feng shui* of this place truly isn't very good.\"\n\n\"It's quite good,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Heh,\" Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Actually, there are crises everywhere in life. For now, it just seems they had bad luck. For example, if you're unlucky, rubbing a book page against your lips can cause a large cut, or take tomatine in tomatoes, which is also a type of alkaloid toxin.\"\n\n\"Then why haven't I died from eating tomatoes regularly?\"\n\n\"If you eat four tons, the toxic dose would be lethal.\"\n\n\".........\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Anyone would die after eating four tons of anything!\" Xu Qinglang hissed in a low voice.\n\n\"Alright, we've seen the shop, and it's time for us to go. If we don't leave soon, Uncle Police will ask us to give statements again. We already gave a statement for the jumping incident a while ago. If we do it again and run into someone we know, they'll really start seeing us as Conan.\"\n\n\"What bad luck today. We came here all excited, and who knew something like this would happen.\" Xu Qinglang flicked his cigarette butt and stepped on it.\n\n\"I thought you'd be somewhat happy about having one less competitor.\"\n\n\"That's going too far, what you're saying. The poor girl only just died.\"\n\n\"Oh, then tell me, can a person's soul float out right after they die?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the shop entrance ahead, where a girl wearing a yellow sweater stood.\n\nHer clothing was different from the dead girl's, but this girl had a graceful figure, a slender physique, and especially those long legs, which were incredibly alluring.\n\nOf course, if she had a head, she would look even better.\n\n\"This...\" Xu Qinglang was stunned.\n\nEven with the greatest injustice, a soul usually only forms into a vengeful ghost around the \"Head Seven\"<sup>1</sup>; it's impossible to transform immediately upon death. Moreover, it's a matter of luck and probability; perhaps only one soul out of a thousand deaths will linger in the human world.\n\n\"I knew it, how could a fan directly cut off a head?\" Zhou Ze stood up and started walking in that direction.\n\nThat girl died; someone had to get justice for her!\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze instinctively clutched his chest with one hand; it was starting to hurt again.\n\nFor performance, for performance, this is for performance!\n\nYesterday, when Chen Zesheng was taken away, my performance increased from eight percent to ten percent. Collecting one ghost only boosts it by one or two points; getting promoted to full status would take forever!\n\nThis one's good, it can even kill people. A ghost that can kill people,\n\nValuable!\n\nWith a shift in thought, a change in perspective,\n\nHis chest stopped hurting.\n\nXu Qinglang also followed along, but just as he stepped into the crowd, he suddenly felt his vision blur, becoming disoriented, and he fell directly to the ground.\n\n\"Sh*t...\"\n\nThe palm of his hand had a gash from bracing himself against the ground when he fell, breaking the skin and drawing beads of blood.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately got up. Onlookers were everywhere, and police had set up a cordon, but he couldn't find Zhou Ze or the headless girl.\n\nHe was somewhat bewildered.\n\nThe sun seemed to become even more dazzling at that moment, and the air around him was oppressive, making it hard for him to breathe.\n\nHe was a little flustered, and also a bit uneasy.\n\nAlthough his cultivation<sup>2</sup> wasn't high, he wasn't a novice either. He shouldn't have been scared like this by a headless ghost, but the frantic emotion in his heart simply wouldn't subside.\n\nHe started searching, weaving through the crowd. He was looking for Zhou Ze and the headless girl, feeling that if he could just find one of them, he would be able to shake off this panicked, disoriented feeling he had.\n\nHe searched and searched and searched...\n\nHe searched and searched and searched...\n\nBeads of sweat dripped from Xu Qinglang's forehead, his body was breaking out in cold sweats, and his lips were chapped. Xu Qinglang looked up at the sun, feeling as though his eyes could barely open.\n\n\"Snap...\"\n\nA crisp sound came from behind and to his side. Xu Qinglang instinctively pushed through the crowd, stumbling as he walked towards it.\n\nHe walked to the entrance of a noodle shop,\n\nAnd saw Zhou Ze sitting inside.\n\n\"You're here! I've been looking for you for ages!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was practically crying tears of joy. The confusion and despair he had just experienced were indescribable, like being banished into his own nightmare.\n\nYou couldn't perceive the beginning,\n\nNor experience the end.\n\nXu Qinglang ran towards Zhou Ze. He was excited, very, very excited.\n\nActually, he wasn't gay; his sexual orientation had always been normal. It was just that fate had given him the wrong body, and sometimes he would make jokes about it to suit the situation, but he never really took them to heart.\n\nBut undeniably, at that moment, after seeing Zhou Ze,\n\nHe truly felt joy from the bottom of his heart!\n\nAs if seeing an oasis in the desert, or a piece of bread for a starving person.\n\nHe lunged, he ran, he spread his arms.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze also stand up,\n\nThen he saw the ceiling fan above Zhou Ze's head,\n\nThe fan was spinning,\n\nSpinning very fast,\n\nA look of terror appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. He wanted to shout for Zhou Ze to dodge, to shout 'no,'\n\nBut his body continued to run forward due to inertia.\n\nHe seemed to foresee his own end,\n\nZhou Ze would pick him up,\n\nThen lift him,\n\nAnd then his head,\n\nSnap...\n\nLike a cucumber being snapped in half.\n\nHowever, he didn't see open arms,\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze raise his leg.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nOne kick,\n\nStruck hard into his abdomen.\n\nXu Qinglang fell to the ground, only to find himself lying by the side of the road, a small car having just sped past him.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was standing by the side of the road.\n\nHis body was already drenched in cold sweat. Xu Qinglang touched his forehead,\n\n\"Did I just get duped?\"\n\n\"You almost ran into traffic and got yourself killed,\" Zhou Ze said unhurriedly, as if saying, \"Oh, the weather's not bad today, is it?\"\n\n\"That thing is that fierce?\" Xu Qinglang said, still feeling lingering fear.\n\n\"She must have sensed us tracking her, so she struck first. This isn't like a pure ghost; killing is like drinking water to her. If I hadn't stopped you just now, you would've been run over.\"\n\n\"If not a ghost, then what is it?\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen the Great Sage Equal to Heaven who can masturbate?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\n\"I have,\" Zhou Ze sighed. \"She crossed the road and went into the mall opposite. Don't go; I'll pursue her alone.\"\n\n\"A joke! She almost killed me; how could I let her off the hook!\"\n\nXu Qinglang got up from the ground and brushed the dust off his clothes,\n\n\"I'll go back and cook first. You kill her, and I'll wait for you to come back for dinner.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Last night, he felt that priest also understood boundaries<sup>3</sup>; now he realized his neighbor understood them pretty well too.\n\nThe light turned green,\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, crossed the road directly via the crosswalk, and after entering the mall opposite, he continued his search.\n\nActually, sometimes Zhou Ze felt a bit frustrated. His ability, which seemed very powerful and could make Bai Yingying scream and shout,\n\nBut at other times, it seemed quite useless.\n\nHe was a certified person now, but his ability often wasn't suitable for ghost-catching. For example, now, after the headless woman entered the mall, Zhou Ze truly lost his sense of direction within the bustling crowd.\n\nFurthermore, another reason Zhou Ze believed the other party wasn't an ordinary ghost was that the ghost's malevolent aura wasn't heavy. To be able to kill in broad daylight and use illusions within a crowd, nearly making Xu Qinglang run himself into a car...\n\nAn ordinary ghost truly wouldn't have such ability.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed a woman in a yellow sweater walking out from a diagonal direction. But she had a head, and some freckles on her face.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively walked over, but then he saw another woman in a yellow sweater in another direction, and then he saw many more.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze realize that yellow sweaters were the themed uniform for the mall's employees today.\n\nHow was he supposed to find her now!\n\nZhou Ze walked to the cooler, opened it, took out a bottle of mineral water, twisted off the cap, and started drinking directly from it.\n\n\"Sir, food items here must be paid for before they can be opened and consumed,\" a sales clerk wearing a yellow sweater walked up to Zhou Ze and reminded him.\n\nShe was very young, probably a student working part-time.\n\n\"My apologies,\" Zhou Ze took out a ten-yuan bill and handed it to her. \"Could you pay for it for me?\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze even reached out and squeezed her face.\n\nThere was a touch,\n\nIt must be a real head, then.\n\nThe girl, however, pointed at Zhou Ze in indignant embarrassment and shouted, \"What do you mean by that?!\"\n\nTaking ten yuan, with a bottle of mineral water costing two, that meant having eight yuan,\n\nAnd thinking he could do whatever he wanted!\n\nNot to mention that this granny wasn't that kind of person,\n\nBut even with just eight yuan, to trifle with someone like that, it's just too much!\n\n\"Sorry,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand and squatted down on the ground.\n\nThe girl had intended to call for someone to catch the pervert, but seeing Zhou Ze's action, she didn't make a scene. She huffily took the money and prepared to go to the counter to pay.\n\nZhou Ze extended his finger; his black nail grew long and he pressed it against the ground.\n\nI refuse to believe,\n\nI can't find you!\n\nA wisp of black qi seeped from Zhou Ze's fingertip into the ground,\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze saw black footprints appear beside him,\n\nThe footprints began to extend outwards,\n\nExtending all the way to behind the young girl who was taking his ten yuan bill to the counter to pay.\n***\n<sup>1</sup> \"Head Seven\" (頭七): In Chinese tradition, it is believed that a deceased person's soul returns home on the seventh day after their death.

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood up, preparing to call out to the girl.\n\nBut at this moment, he was astonished to find black footprints everywhere in the shopping mall. Not only the girl from before, but the soles of everyone else's shoes – other customers, salesclerks – seemed to be smeared with a layer of black grease, leaving clear tracks with every step.\n\nThis was a situation Zhou Ze had not anticipated. Could it be that everyone in this mall was a ghost?\n\nEven a ghost market couldn't be this exaggerated.\n\nThe last time Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang experienced Madam Bai's banquet, it was just a few tables of people making a ruckus, nowhere near as grand or sophisticated as this. And Madam Bai had cultivated for two hundred years, even having her own temple statue in between.\n\nA feeling of dizziness suddenly struck.\n\nZhou Ze felt as if he were on a carousel in an amusement park,\n\neverything around him felt so unreal, appearing bizarre and fantastical.\n\nYou couldn't tell what was fake, nor could you figure out what was real,\n\nonly dazedly looking left and right.\n\nHe remembered Xu Qinglang had experienced a similar scene not long ago, then he suddenly rushed into the road. If Zhou Ze hadn't kicked him, he might have been hit by a car and sent flying.\n\nAnd now, that feeling was coming for him.\n\nThat guy,\n\nwas he planning to make a move on him?\n\nAs a ghost messenger, to be counterattacked by the ghost he was chasing seemed a bit unreasonable. What was most alarming was that Zhou Ze didn't know how to resist.\n\nHis understanding of ghost-catching had always been stuck in the habitual belief that his fingernails could be unbeatable, but this time, it seemed even his fingernails couldn't help him.\n\nStaggering, Zhou Ze sat down on the ground. He seemed to see someone handing him some change in front of him,\n\nand faintly heard someone say to him, \"Here's your eight yuan in change.\"\n\nThen,\n\nthe girl's head in front of him began to blur. Everything in his sight seemed to be wrapped in a layer of paste, making him nauseous and dizzy.\n\nIt was as if he had returned to the Yellow Springs Road, numbly tiptoeing forward with the masses.\n\nThe Buddha said, all sentient beings have distinct forms,\n\nbut on the Yellow Springs Road, there is only one form.\n\nZhou Ze felt he couldn't even draw a breath. He subconsciously reached out and clutched his own neck, lowering his head and coughing forcefully. He wanted to cry out, but no sound came.\n\nThis was a feeling of days stretching into years, a form of mental torture. Xu Qinglang had easily broken down inside it earlier, and now Zhou Ze was also trapped within it.\n\nZhou Ze felt he should do something, but at this moment, it seemed he could do nothing but passively endure it all.\n\nPain,\n\noppression,\n\nsuffocation,\n\ntorment arriving one after another, ceaselessly lashing at your soul.\n\n…………\n\n\"Sir, sir, what's wrong?\"\n\nThe girl handed the change to Zhou Ze, but then suddenly noticed the man in front of her. His eyes were becoming cloudy, and he looked to be in great pain.\n\nThe girl's first reaction was that the man was trying to stage an accident, that he'd drunk the water sold at her supermarket and immediately felt unwell.\n\nBut after watching for a while, she didn't think so; the man seemed genuinely in pain.\n\n\"Sir, should I call 120¹ for you?\" the girl asked.\n\nWho knew, the man in front of her reached out, pushed her to the ground, then staggered to his feet and ran out.\n\nThe girl had originally wanted to call the police or 120, as she felt the man's state was very unstable. But in the end, adhering to the mentality that it was better to have one less trouble than one more, she didn't take out her phone.\n\n…………\n\nEverything around him was like a mirror made of water, reflecting various lights. The few rays of light that shone in offered no warmth, but instead added to an inner restlessness.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know where he was going, nor what he was doing. He had even mentally prepared himself to be like Xu Qinglang before him, walking into the road and waiting for a car to hit him.\n\nHe could only offer a passive resistance. He didn't know where he was or where he was going, but he kept resisting the self-destructive urge that arose within him.\n\n\"Clang...\"\n\nA sound echoed,\n\nZhou Ze knocked over the trash can in front of him and fell into a pile of garbage. The pungent, sour smell didn't wake him. In his vision, lush green grass was everywhere, like a paradise.\n\nEven though the surrounding scenery was beautiful, even though the light all around was vibrant,\n\nit offered not the slightest feeling of comfort.\n\nThis place was more like a cage, instinctively repelling him, making him want to escape it.\n\nJoyful laughter echoed around him. Nearby, it seemed a group of merry women were gracefully dancing. In the distance, incense smoke curled, as if countless people were making offerings at a divine altar.\n\nVarious images ceaselessly appeared in Zhou Ze's mind, squeezing his nerves little by little. Any single image could become the last straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nFinally, the image froze,\n\nZhou Ze found himself standing at the entrance of a familiar courtyard,\n\nwith the sign for the orphanage hanging above it.\n\nIn front of him, a couple was leaving a baby stroller there; they seemed ready to leave.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze grew up, he had asked the director about his birth. In fact, the director would not hide such things once the children grew up; he told Zhou Ze that he had been actively abandoned by his parents.\n\nSince then, Zhou Ze had never thought about finding his birth parents. He simply treated it as if his parents were dead; his life would no longer need them.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly had a premonition,\n\nthat the couple in front should be his parents,\n\nand the child in the stroller,\n\nshould be himself.\n\nHe subconsciously lifted his foot,\n\nwanting to run over,\n\nto see what his parents looked like, and perhaps even question them about why they abandoned him.\n\nBut this foot only lifted,\n\nit didn't fall.\n\nA look of struggle appeared on Zhou Ze's face,\n\nhe instinctively sensed something: if that foot fell, it would be an abyss!\n\nAll the beautiful things finally solidified into the scene before him. This was a poisoned pie, a trap set by a hunter, just waiting for the prey to take that step.\n\n…………\n\nAt the edge of the building's rooftop,\n\nZhou Ze, already standing on the parapet wall, swayed precariously. He subconsciously leaned forward repeatedly as if to fall, but each time adjusted his center of gravity back.\n\nHe was struggling,\n\nhe was resisting,\n\nand his life hung by a thread.\n\nOn one side of the rooftop stood a headless woman.\n\nThe woman was no longer wearing a yellow sweater, but a cyan long robe. Its style was a bit old-fashioned, and there were several tears around it, but the woman stood there coldly, facing Zhou Ze, who seemed on the verge of falling at any moment.\n\nAnd on the rooftop, there was a third person, a priest.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze couldn't open his eyes at this moment, otherwise he would surely recognize this priest, whom he had just met not long ago.\n\nAt Miss Liu's funeral, this priest had, from beginning to end, said nothing else apart from offering him a cigarette.\n\nEven when facing the strange and cold dinner parties of those two families, the priest merely stood on the side, quietly watching, as if appreciating a Ukiyo-e painting.\n\nThe priest looked at Zhou Ze for a moment, then at the headless woman in front of him,\n\nHe shook his head,\n\nand said to the headless woman: \"Qingyi Niangniang, he is a ghost messenger.\"\n\nThis was a reminder,\n\nreminding the headless woman of the man's identity.\n\nBut this reminder was undoubtedly like adding fuel to the fire.\n\nThe priest, unaware of adding fuel to the fire, continued: \"If he is killed by you, it will provoke a reaction from Hell.\"\n\nThe headless woman suddenly turned around, facing the priest.\n\nThe priest gave a nonchalant smile and immediately changed his tune: \"But he is just a temporary ghost messenger, a low-ranking one. Even if he's gone, he's gone.\n\nAt this moment, anyone who dares to disturb Niangniang's interest shouldn't come to a good end.\n\nAnd Niangniang herself did nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe headless woman turned back, resuming her stance facing Zhou Ze, seemingly letting go of the somewhat annoying priest.\n\nThe priest stood there, continuing to act as a spectator, which seemed to be his favorite role.\n\nHe knew the identity of this headless woman, and was even a little surprised that this ghost messenger, whom he had met once before, hadn't detected the woman's identity immediately.\n\nJust how unproficient was this ghost messenger at his job?\n\nShe's not a ghost,\n\nshe's simply not someone you can supervise,\n\nyet you're staring at her, chasing her,\n\nand in the end,\n\nyou've angered her.\n\nWomen, you know, hold grudges.\n\nEspecially this one here,\n\na woman who doesn't have much time left.\n\nThe priest's gaze shifted behind him. The building was tall, offering a great view, from which he could see a distant construction site where demolition was underway, stirring up dust.\n\nThe most direct memory an era could leave people was indeed its architecture. And the current urban redevelopment and upgrading was undoubtedly a process of slowly erasing many past imprints.\n\nTurning back,\n\nlooking at Zhou Ze, still standing on the edge and swaying back and forth,\n\nthe priest felt a little surprised.\n\nThis temporary ghost messenger really could hold on.\n\nEven if it were him, he probably couldn't last this long.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nthe priest suddenly saw the fingernails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers slowly melting. But the melted liquid didn't drip down; instead, it flowed back into his body.\n\nZhou Ze's skin, at this moment, gradually began to take on a bronze luster. This wasn't the bronze color created by sunlight and exercise, but one tinged with\n\ndarkness,\n\ncurses,\n\ncoldness,\n\nand many other negative presences.\n\nAt the same time, the priest noticed that from Zhou Ze's tightly closed eyes, a green light slowly began to emit, like a fierce beast that had been dormant,\n\nand now,\n\nwas gradually being stimulated to awaken.\n\nAt the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth, two fangs slowly pierced through his lips.\n\nBai Yingying had always been curious about one thing: she was a jiangshi who had slept for two hundred years, yet why was she beaten senseless by Zhou Ze's fingernails!\n\nBefore him,\n\nthe priest, with a look of disbelief on his face, provided the answer for her,\n\nHis mouth twitched,\n\nand he uttered two words:\n\n\"Jiangshi!\"\n\n---\n¹ 120: The emergency ambulance number in mainland China.\n² Yellow Springs Road: In Chinese mythology, the path to the underworld.",

    "content": "On the rooftop,\n\nZhou Ze, at the edge, was slowly turning around.\n\nThe Father's lips parted in surprise and doubt.\n\nThe headless woman still stood there; the wind on the rooftop was strong, but her skirt remained perfectly still.\n\n\"This shouldn't be. As a Ghost Messenger, his previous life's physical body must be gone. Most of them can only inhabit others' bodies to walk among humans. How exactly did this zombie come to be?\" The Father muttered to himself, his forehead covered in question marks.\n\nAs a qualified bystander, keen observation and diligent thought were essential qualities.\n\nAnd when Zhou Ze turned around, the Father's previously parted lips slowly curved into a smile, as he suddenly realized:\n\n\"Sodeta ne!\"*\n\nUnlike the bronze hue that was appearing on Zhou Ze's arms, the skin exposed on his front, though also showing a faint bronze luster, was very pale and uneven. At the same time, some areas of his skin began to wrinkle and crack, and blood slowly seeped out, presenting a terrifying sight.\n\n\"He carries a small portion of zombie inheritance within his soul. Now, after receiving extreme mental stimulation, the zombie part of his soul has manifested. But his body is still that of an ordinary person, simply unable to bear and inherit such a load, which led to this bizarre situation. This is a zombie, and also not a zombie.\" The Father murmured to himself, a hint of excitement in his eyes. His hands, hidden beneath his sleeves, slightly opened, and two scalpels appeared in his palms.\n\n\"Which part should I cut off to take back for slow study, or perhaps, take the whole thing back?\" Licking his lips, the Father seemed a little troubled. The opponent was a Ghost Messenger. Qingyi Niangniang might not care about his identity as a Ghost Messenger, but he couldn't afford not to. And if Qingyi Niangniang killed him completely, then a corpse he brought back would have no research value.\n\n\"It's truly frustrating, isn't it?\" The Father scratched his head, looking very conflicted, but the two scalpels he held in his hands gleamed under the sun, instantly drawing the gazes of both the headless woman and Zhou Ze towards him.\n\n\"Oh!\" The Father's face froze. He immediately threw the two scalpels to the ground, taking a step back. He bowed slightly, and said very sincerely: \"Excuse me, I've interrupted you. Please carry on.\" A bystander getting themselves involved in a fight only to die inexplicably was a cardinal sin for a bystander.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze fell once again on the headless woman. To be honest, the previous Zhou Ze was purely a killer from behind,** but now, the constant seeping blood and tearing skin on his front truly revealed Zhou Ze's extremely poor physical condition. Rather than saying Zhou Ze was a zombie now, it was more like he was Mr. Zombie A, an extra in a Western zombie film. The only difference was, Zhou Ze's eyes emitted a green glow, which made him look a bit more advanced than the extras in Western zombie films who could be killed with a random axe. Hmm, upgraded from an extra to an extra with 50-cent special effects.***\n\n\"Ah!\" Zhou Ze opened his mouth, and let out a roar. It wasn't a world-shaking volume, nor a surging, heroic might, but rather a wail from damaged vocal cords.\n\nThe headless woman continued to stand there, unmoving.\n\nAnd then, Zhou Ze moved. His physical movements were exaggerated, running like a sprinter, with huge bodily swings, as he lunged directly at the headless woman. There was no crashing sound, nor dazzling sparks. It was like a man, drunk and in a drunken rage, tackling a frail woman. There was no beauty to speak of.\n\n*Rustle...*\n\nZhou Ze, having tackled her to the ground, pressed down on the headless woman beneath him, and directly raised his fist to strike.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\"Thud!\"\n\"Thud!\"\n\nPunch after punch landed, each punch hitting the concrete slab of the rooftop. All around, there were bloodstains everywhere. Not Qingyi Niangniang's bloodstains, but Zhou Ze's.\n\n\"Because in this state, only instinct remains with no room for thought, he's no longer affected by Qingyi Niangniang's abilities, is that it? And because he carries the aura of a zombie, he can touch a spiritual body, allowing him to attack.\" The Father opened his mouth and said, \"Oh.\" \"How exactly did a person like this become a Ghost Messenger? Has Hell's vetting system truly deteriorated to such an extent?\"\n\nUnder the repeated heavy blows, it seemed as if Zhou Ze was repeatedly striking the concrete slab, but in reality, Qingyi Niangniang's body was slowly distorting, like a pool of water, constantly rippling. The surface of the water was no longer calm.\n\n\"It looks like Qingyi Niangniang is bound to lose. Although she doesn't belong to the sequence of ghosts, she possesses no physical attack capabilities other than mental influence. Now she can only passively take the blows.\" As he spoke, the Father looked towards the construction site in the distance again. \"But it's going to happen soon anyway. Dying by their hand over there, or by the hand of the person in front of me, the outcome is actually the same, isn't it?\"\n\nHowever, just as his schadenfreude ended, the Father's eyes suddenly grew cloudy. Qingyi Niangniang, pressed beneath Zhou Ze, suddenly flipped her left hand towards the Father.\n\n\"I made a mistake, didn't I? I could have watched from further away with binoculars, enjoying my own drama.**** Why did I have to be so close? This time, I'm going to be controlled and used as a henchman. How unlucky...\" The Father lowered his head, then sharply raised it, his eyes glowing with a faint blue light. Then, he quickly picked up the scalpels he had just thrown to the ground and charged directly at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Swish!\"\n\"Swish!\"\n\nTwo scalpels were directly plunged into Zhou Ze's back.\n\n\"Ah!\" Zhou Ze raised his head, letting out a silent roar.\n\nImmediately after, the Father, holding the scalpels, tried to pull them down along the insertion wounds, but the blades seemed to be stuck in Zhou Ze's bones, unable to move.\n\n\"Crunch!\" Zhou Ze suddenly spun around, sweeping his arm across.\n\nYes, Zhou Ze couldn't fight, hadn't learned martial arts, nor practiced Sanda or Muay Thai. Therefore, when he was in a frenzy, he could only counterattack based on instinct. \"If a mosquito bites me, I'll just swat the mosquito dead.\" Zhou Ze's arm directly smacked the Father's face. The Father's entire face was almost twisted, and he was sent flying backward, landing right on the edge of the rooftop. If he had been just a little bit off, he would have fallen. The left side of his face was highly swollen. He opened his mouth and spat out several broken teeth. Blood stained the spaces between his teeth.\n\n\"Baka!\"***** The Father flipped his hands again, and two talismans appeared. These were Onmyoji ghost-taming runes. When he charged at Zhou Ze again, he dodged Zhou Ze's fist, then directly placed the two talismans on Zhou Ze's chest. Instantly, the runes seemed to burn, leaving two charred marks on Zhou Ze's chest. The scent of roasted flesh even began to waft out. However, Zhou Ze directly wrapped his arms around the Father, embracing him, then, still holding him, brutally slammed him against the rooftop wall.\n\n\"Thud!\" The concrete wall was largely shattered, and the Father spat out a large mouthful of blood. Two grown men, on the rooftop, because of one woman, fought to the death.\n\n*****\n\n\"Hey, pay attention over there, hurry and demolish it! Tear it down before those old folks come over, quickly!\" A construction foreman directed the bulldozer forward. Ahead was a dilapidated old temple. What was enshrined inside wasn't a Bodhisattva, nor any Taoist figure. In fact, the temple didn't even have a plaque.\n\n\"Boom!\" The temple wall was pushed down, along with the statue inside, so damaged that its head had fallen off years ago, collapsing with it. The excavator and bulldozer worked together, finally leveling the temple completely.\n\n\"Hey, what kind of temple was this?\" The excavator operator climbed down from his machine. To be honest, during demolition, he feared encountering situations like this the most; demolishing someone's temple could harm his moral merit,****** potentially bringing him misfortune. In every industry, there were more or less similar superstitions.\n\n\"A small temple. When I was little, people still went to pray there. Now it's gone. My grandpa took me there to pray back then. It was called Qingyi Niangniang, similar to Guanyin, the Giver of Children; people prayed to her for sons.\"\n\n\"Then why did you still let us demolish it?\"\n\n\"If we don't demolish it, how will the project proceed? You don't know how long those old people living here have been bothering us because of this broken temple. Who still worships this damn Qingyi Niangniang nowadays? There are infertility clinics everywhere; if you can't have children, just go to a doctor. Besides, when I was little, I thought this Qingyi Niangniang was some big shot, but when I grew up, I found out there's no such person in history. It's just old superstitious, feudal stuff passed down. You could say we're breaking superstitions here.\" The foreman spat a thick wad of phlegm onto the ground and shouted: \"Tell them over there to hurry up! Demolish this whole area before sunset!\"\n\n*****\n\nOn the rooftop, Qingyi Niangniang's body, which Zhou Ze had tackled to the ground, slowly crumbled. The Father was right. She wasn't a ghost.\n\nAs Qingyi Niangniang disintegrated, The Father's eyes revealed a clear light. He stood up, clutching his chest; heaven knew how many ribs he'd broken. When he saw Zhou Ze charging at him again, he was so startled that he flung open the rooftop door and fled towards the stairwell, not even daring to look back. But Zhou Ze, halfway through his charge, suddenly slowed down. He stumbled precariously, and the bluish-green light in his eyes gradually faded. The bronze luster on his body also gradually receded, leaving only, from top to bottom, dense, terrifying wounds.\n\nZhou Ze's body swayed. He ultimately walked to the edge of the rooftop, unable to control his balance, and with a misstep, he fell directly off.\n\nThe back of the building was a garbage disposal area. Bags of household waste were piled high there, and many stray cats and dogs scavenged for food nearby.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\"Meow meow meow!!!\"\n\"Woof woof woof!!!\"\n\nWhen Zhou Ze crashed into the area, he startled the cats and dogs into a frenzy.\n\nZhou Ze had almost lost most of his consciousness; only his fingers instinctively curled. Two bolder stray dogs came closer, continuously sniffing Zhou Ze's body with their noses.\n\n\"Chatter chatter chatter!!!\" Just then, a golden snub-nosed monkey, holding a plastic toy hammer, hopped over in a few quick steps, waving the plastic toy hammer to chase the two dogs away. Then it looked at the man, who was covered in injuries and barely breathing.\n\nWhen it saw the man's face, the monkey scratched its head. It didn't know why, but seeing this face made it feel very uncomfortable. It didn't remember its past, and had been living here for a while. It had even tamed these stray dogs and cats; living like a king in the garbage heap wasn't bad. But this face really displeased the monkey! Although it didn't know where this displeasure came from, it just felt displeased!\n\n*Tap tap tap!* The monkey tapped Zhou Ze's head several times with the plastic toy hammer. \"That's for making this monkey unhappy to look at,\" \"That's for looking so displeasing to this monkey!\"\n\nAfter tapping a few times, Zhou Ze's head slumped to the side, and he completely passed out.\n\n\"Whoa!\" The monkey was so scared that it immediately dropped the plastic toy hammer it was holding. It covered its mouth with both hands, truly worried that it had just hammered this guy to death.\n\n---\n*A Japanese phrase meaning \"I see\" or \"That's it,\" used to express understanding or realization.\n**A \"killer from behind\" in this context refers to someone who looks good from the back, but perhaps not as good from the front.\n***A Chinese internet slang term referring to low-budget or poor-quality special effects.\n****Literally \"eating my own melon,\" a Chinese internet idiom meaning to mind one's own business while enjoying watching others' drama unfold.\n*****A Japanese exclamation, typically meaning \"idiot\" or \"damn it.\"\n******In Chinese culture, \"yin virtue\" or \"moral merit\" refers to good deeds done in secret that accumulate spiritual credit for future blessings.",

    "content": "A small, abandoned shed, barely able to provide shade and shelter from rain, its surroundings were also messy, but at least there was no obvious trash. Instead, there were some children's toys, neatly stacked.\n\nOh, and there was a person lying there.\n\nUnfortunately, no reporters passed by there at the time. Otherwise, if they could have captured the scene of dozens of stray dogs and cats dragging a person along, publishing it would certainly have moved many people to tears.\n\nThe little monkey was holding a dark, lumpy thing in its hand, like clumps of mud, but this mud looked very clean.\n\nThen, it took out a bit and slowly applied it to the man's wounds.\n\nThe man's wounds were truly too many: two burns on his chest, a penetrating wound on his back, and countless gaping cuts all over his body. As a result, after application, nearly half of the man's body was covered in mud.\n\nHe looked like a 'Beggar's Chicken' about to be unearthed.*¹\n\nSometimes the monkey felt helpless because it truly found the man a complete eyesore, often feeling the urge to strangle him. But each time, after struggling with its helplessness, it could only instinctively find a way to prolong his life, preventing him from dying in such a muddled way right in front of it.\n\nHe should have been dead already. With such severe injuries, even if he fell from the rooftop and landed on a garbage pile, which absorbed most of the impact, his original injuries were already enough to kill an ordinary person several times over.\n\nBut he didn't die. Sometimes, the monkey would press its ear against his chest and could hear the strong thumping of his heartbeat.\n\nJudging by the heartbeat, the man seemed very healthy, not weak at all, but overall, it was truly a miracle that he still had a heartbeat.\n\nIt was as if his heart was a separate part, detached from his entire being.\n\nEven if the rest of his body's organs had long since begun to fail, his heart still frolicked freely, doing as it pleased.\n\nSeven days passed like this. During these seven days, the man remained unconscious and did not wake up. The monkey tried to feed him some mashed food.\n\nThe food was brought by stray dogs and cats as tribute to it. It mashed the food with something and fed it to the man, but each time, the unconscious man would quickly vomit it out.\n\nThis made the monkey furious. It gave him the cleanest, most delicious food, originally its own rations, and he actually vomited it out!\n\nThe monkey felt its life was a bit tacky. Look, the food it usually thought was great, this guy instinctively refused to eat, even while unconscious.\n\nThis is looking down on *this master*!*²\n\nFeeling resentful, the monkey found a jar of 'Lao Gan Ma'*³ with half a bottle left in the shed and directly fed it to him. The monkey had eaten it before; it was so spicy it made it jump up and down.\n\nTo the monkey's surprise, this guy actually ate it. The monkey then brought some more food, mashed it, and continued feeding him, and he ate that too.\n\nThe monkey was stunned.\n\nWhat the hell kind of strong taste is this?!\n\nFinally, on the eighth day, Zhou Ze's eyelids twitched slightly. He slowly opened his eyes, feeling somewhat bewildered as to where he was. It wasn't a hospital, nor a bookstore.\n\nIt looked more like a homeless person's makeshift dwelling.\n\nAt the same time, a furry tail swung back and forth in front of him.\n\nA little girl's face was directly facing him,\n\nOh no,\n\nIt was a bright red apple facing him,\n\nOr not, it seemed,\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze saw clearly:\n\nIt was a monkey's butt directly facing him.\n\nThe monkey was holding mud and applying it to his wounds. Zhou Ze even smelled the earthy odor of the mud. He was a bit anxious, wanting to open his mouth to warn the monkey that doing this might cause his wounds to become inflamed and fester, but after opening his mouth, Zhou Ze could only make \"uh-uh...\" sounds.\n\nHis lips were dry, and his throat was very sore; he couldn't make any sound at all.\n\nThe monkey was startled. It finally turned its little girl's face around, using its own face to look at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe man and the monkey began to stare at each other.\n\nThe monkey suddenly scratched its ears and cheeks. This fellow was awake, but the way this fellow opened his eyes seemed even more obnoxious!\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, felt it was a bit absurd. He had somewhat forgotten the memories of that day on the rooftop, only remembering that he seemed to have had a good, satisfying fight.\n\nIt seemed to be fighting with a woman, and also seemed to be fighting with a Japanese person. In any case, the fight was muddled, and the final outcome was also muddled.\n\nThis feeling was like someone who had drunk too much waking up the next day, with parts of their memory from being drunk yesterday blacked out.\n\nIf he couldn't speak, he wouldn't speak. If he couldn't move, he wouldn't move. If there was a monkey beside him, then there was a monkey.\n\nHis life as a bookstore owner since reincarnating into a new body had successfully transformed Dr. Zhou, who in his previous life was diligent and focused on climbing the ladder, into a handsome man who knew how to be content with his circumstances.\n\nLike an eighty or ninety-year-old elder, he had seen through what needed to be seen through. And Zhou Ze, in fact, had already died once.\n\nAs usual, the monkey applied mud to his wounds every day, and every day, after feeding him Lao Gan Ma, it would feed him spicy strips, Wang Zai Xiao Man Tou*⁴, half a chicken drumstick, and other such foods.\n\nThen, after taking good care of him each day, it would stand in front of him, holding a plastic toy hammer, repeatedly hitting its own head, looking very displeased.\n\nZhou Ze thought this monkey seemed a bit deranged.\n\nHowever, this monkey was truly intelligent, not like an ordinary monkey. In fact, it could even understand the meaning in your gaze. But for most of the day, besides tending to Zhou Ze, it was unwilling to stay around him for too long.\n\nOften, it would stick its butt out, turning its little girl's face towards Zhou Ze, and then stare blankly at the sun or moon in the sky, lost in thought.\n\nThis was a monkey with a story, and it even knew how to contemplate life.\n\nFor the first few days after waking up, Zhou Ze didn't notice anything unusual, but after four or five days, Zhou Ze suddenly thought of something.\n\nThe Great Sage Equal to Heaven*⁵ was born from a stone, which was extraordinary in itself.\n\nFor such 'human-like' monkeys to appear one after another in the small city of Tongcheng, the possibility was unlikely.\n\nAnd he himself, just a few days ago, seemed to have met a monkey,\n\nAnd then,\n\nThat monkey had even been killed by him.\n\nThat incident eventually led to a really messed-up situation: an old cabbage stump*⁶ who claimed to be his servant invited him for a meal, and then cooked his conscience as a dish.\n\nBut that monkey was indeed killed by him. Even if he couldn't find its spirit afterward, it should have lost its physical body.\n\nOne evening, the monkey went out and came back, holding a rolled-up newspaper in its hand. It unfolded the newspaper, and inside was a *youtiao*.*⁷\n\nZhou Ze could now barely swallow on his own. The monkey tore off a piece of *youtiao*, fed himself a bite, then dipped *youtiao* in Lao Gan Ma and fed a bite to Zhou Ze.\n\nThe man and the monkey, surprisingly, had developed a bit of unspoken understanding during this time.\n\nHalfway through eating the *youtiao*, the monkey suddenly froze. It was looking at the newspaper.\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. He thought the monkey was very intelligent, but he hadn't expected it to be smart enough to read a newspaper.\n\nIt was like a pet dog at home; if it could pee and poop in a designated spot and listen to commands to sit and lie down, you'd already think it was very smart. But if one day you saw your dog sitting on the toilet to relieve itself and then flushing the toilet,\n\nYou wouldn't think it was smart; you'd be horrified.\n\nFortunately,\n\nThe monkey wasn't actually reading the words,\n\nBut looking at the cover image of the newspaper.\n\n\"Three-Legged Boy's Surgery a Success.\"\n\nThe monkey looked at the picture,\n\nStunned for a long time,\n\nLike a human, it sighed, and then the monkey reached out and wiped its eyes.\n\nZhou Ze watched the monkey. At this moment, he felt no fear. Yes, this was the monkey he had once killed; he was certain of it now.\n\nYet now, this monkey was repaying evil with kindness.\n\nIt had saved him. Although he didn't know what those muds were, at least they had controlled his injuries.\n\nOriginally, the monkey's cultivation had been ruined because it was caught by the logger Zhou Ze had saved, who then took its brain and ate its flesh. But it seemed that even if this monkey had lost some of its previous memories, its nature remained the same.\n\nThe monkey looked a little wistful, then continued to share the rest of the *youtiao* with Zhou Ze. The monkey found a rope and tied one end around Zhou Ze's neck.\n\nZhou Ze didn't react, letting the monkey do as it pleased, until the rope made a loop around Zhou Ze's neck. The monkey then sat down by Zhou Ze's bed.\n\nIt looked at Zhou Ze, and Zhou Ze looked back at it.\n\nThere were traces of tears in the monkey's eyes, along with anger, hatred, and unwillingness.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze recognized it, the monkey also seemed to recognize Zhou Ze.\n\nThe grievances and kindnesses between the two of them were unclear as to who was right or wrong, but if either party said an end needed to be made, it seemed only reasonable.\n\nThe monkey slowly tightened the rope. It could completely strangle Zhou Ze now, just as Zhou Ze had killed it by piercing its own body with his fingernail in the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze lay there, appearing utterly helpless.\n\nAt this moment, several stray dogs appeared outside the shed. Their animal instincts told them there might be a big meal soon.\n\nWith their level of intelligence, they naturally didn't understand why their Monkey Brother, after saving this person, would then want to kill him. Perhaps they thought the meat would taste better if the person was fattened up?\n\nBut the monkey suddenly turned around and bared its fangs at the stray dogs outside.\n\nThe stray dogs, startled, fled in disarray.\n\nThe monkey then looked despondently at Zhou Ze, and reached out to untie the rope from Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"*Slap*!\"\n\nThe monkey slapped itself, a very loud, resounding slap.\n\nThen it jumped off the bed, rummaged through the garbage pile, found a mobile phone with a broken screen, and then jumped back in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe phone was on. This was something the monkey had brought back yesterday. And Zhou Ze saw a signal display on the phone's broken screen, meaning there was a working SIM card inside.\n\nThe monkey knew what a phone was. It extended its paw and pointed at the buttons on the phone, gesturing for Zhou Ze to tell it what to press.\n\nZhou Ze extended his hand and took the phone from the monkey's paw.\n\nThe monkey was startled by Zhou Ze's movement. It hadn't expected him to be able to move already.\n\nIf his hand could move, then his fingernails could move too.\n\nA moment later,\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nThen the monkey once again picked up its plastic toy hammer,\n\nThis time, it was aimed at Zhou Ze's head:\n\n\"*Bop, bop, bop*!!!\"\n\nThat's for pretending!\n\nThat's for pretending!\n\nThat's for pretending!\n\nAfter hitting for a while,\n\nThe monkey dropped the plastic toy hammer it was holding,\n\nAnd sat there,\n\nAnd smiled too.\n\n---\n*¹ Beggar's Chicken: A traditional Chinese dish of a whole chicken wrapped in lotus leaves and clay, then baked.\n*² This master: A self-aggrandizing term used by some to refer to themselves, implying superiority or an arrogant attitude.\n*³ Lao Gan Ma: A popular brand of chili crisp or chili sauce from China.\n*⁴ Wang Zai Xiao Man Tou: A popular brand of small, sweet, milk-flavored buns or cookies from China.\n*⁵ Great Sage Equal to Heaven: A title of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, a mythical figure from the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*.\n*⁶ Old cabbage stump: A derogatory term used to describe an old, useless, or stubborn person.\n*⁷ Youtiao: A long, golden-brown, deep-fried strip of dough, often eaten for breakfast in China.",

    "content": "Holding the phone, Zhou Ze laboriously got up and leaned against the plank wall, sitting. Actually, he could move a little now; he might not be able to get out of bed and walk around, but in other respects, he really wasn't as weak as he had seemed before.\n\nHe reached out and pointed at a spot under the bed.\n\nThe little monkey turned its head to look and found half an opened pack of Xiaosu cigarettes.\n\nIt jumped down, picked up the cigarettes, and brought them to Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nZhou Ze then made a gesture for a lighter.\n\nThe little monkey was stunned for a moment, feeling very ashamed and indignant, wishing it could pull out its big stick and hit Zhou Ze with it!\n\n\"Haven't smoked in a long time, feel like having one.\"\n\nThe little monkey jumped off the bed again, rummaged through the pile of miscellaneous items, and actually found a lighter and threw it over.\n\nHe lit the cigarette, took a puff, and blew out a smoke ring. Although his body was still weak, like a canvas patched countless times and ready to fall apart at any moment, this first cigarette in over ten days still allowed Zhou Ze to experience a sense of ease.\n\nHe had deliberately pretended he couldn't move. As for the purpose, Zhou Ze couldn't quite say.\n\nWas it guilt?\n\nWas it a debt owed?\n\nPerhaps, perhaps not. Even now, Zhou Ze didn't feel he had made the wrong choice back then.\n\nBut at least for now, this monkey had indeed saved his life; he owed it a lot.\n\nHolding his phone, Zhou Ze thought for a moment and realized he didn't remember Bai Yingying's or Xu Qinglang's phone numbers at all. These days weren't like the past, when people used public phones at small shops; few people bothered to memorize phone numbers—they were all saved directly in contacts.\n\nHaving no choice, Zhou Ze eventually called \"110\"¹.\n\nAs for his disappearance, Xu Qinglang and the others had indeed reported it. Zhou Ze told the operator on the phone that he was fine, then asked them to help contact the reporters to pick him up, so as not to trouble the police uncles² with their deployment.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Xu Qinglang arrived in a Nissan; Bai Yingying was also in the car.\n\nXu Qinglang, walking into the shanty while covering his nose, after seeing Zhou Ze lying on the bed, his eyes immediately welled up, but he quickly suppressed it.\n\nPerhaps,\nthe cruelest thing in this world,\nis agreeing I'd come home to cook,\nbut you couldn't come back to eat.\n\nBai Yingying picked Zhou Ze up from the bed. Her strength was immense; carrying Zhou Ze was like child's play for her.\n\nZhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang, who was to one side, \"Bring the monkey too.\"\n\nThe little monkey squatted by the bed, watching Zhou Ze being carried away, holding its plastic toy hammer in its hand,\nwaving it,\nas if saying goodbye.\n\nHowever, when Xu Qinglang walked towards it, the little monkey immediately jumped onto the plank wall; it clearly didn't want to leave.\n\nBeing a makeshift king³ here, with a motley crew of subordinates⁴ under its command, and so many subordinates bringing offerings every day, how comfortable it was! It certainly didn't want to leave.\n\nBesides, this guy it had saved, it still found a bit displeasing.\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze repeated, \"Take it.\"\n\nNo room for discussion,\na pet I fancy,\nmust be taken away.\n\nXu Qinglang went to catch the monkey. The monkey's movements were very agile; Xu Qinglang couldn't catch it at all.\n\nBai Yingying settled Zhou Ze in the car, then dashed over in a flash. The monkey hadn't expected this woman to be so fast; it jumped one step too slow and was caught by the tail.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!!!\"\n\nThe monkey bared its teeth at Bai Yingying, its face showing ferocity!\n\nYou stinky hag,\nHow dare you catch me!\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nBai Yingying also opened her mouth at the monkey, revealing her zombie fangs,\na scene of a hideous fanged face⁵,\ndirectly scared the monkey senseless.\n\nKeep being mischievous⁶,\nBelieve it or not, this old lady will eat you!\n\n\"Be good, come with your grand-aunt⁷.\"\n\nBai Yingying dragged the monkey by its butt with one hand and held its tail with the other, put it into the car, then closed both the car door and windows.\n\nZhou Ze was sitting in the back seat, half-reclined.\n\nThe monkey sat right beside Zhou Ze,\nwith its arms crossed, clearly sulking.\n\nIt felt that it had saved Zhou Ze, but Zhou Ze was turning around and trying to deprive it of its freedom—this was very bad!\n\nI treated you like a patient, but you want to 'discipline' me in a secret room⁸!\n\n\"Taking you away is because I'm afraid if you save people again, you'll be harmed instead,\" Zhou Ze explained weakly. \"The grievances from the previous life are considered wiped clean; this life, I owe you first. Stay with me for a while, if you still want to leave later, then leave.\"\n\nThe monkey didn't know if it understood or not, but it was indeed a bit more docile than before.\n\nXu Qinglang threw over a pack of biscuits. The monkey caught it, tore open the sealed bag itself, ate with its hands, and didn't forget to put one into Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nDuring this period, the man and the monkey had indeed developed a certain unspoken understanding in their daily lives.\n\n\"Oh, looks like I worried for nothing,\" Xu Qinglang said, driving the car, \"you two have been having quite a comfortable time lately.\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly interjected, \"Are you jealous of a monkey?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was choked speechless and said nothing more.\n\nThe bookstore hadn't moved yet. With Zhou Ze, the boss, suddenly disappearing for half a month, who would still be in the mood to relocate? So Xu Qinglang still drove back to the old place.\n\nGetting out of the car,\nit was still Bai Yingying carrying Zhou Ze into the bookstore. Zhou Ze also adopted a 'when in Rome' attitude; if he had a choice, between Xu Qinglang and Bai Yingying,\nZhou Ze still felt he was more comfortable being carried by Bai Yingying.\n\nThe monkey didn't run away, but instead followed closely into the bookstore.\n\n\"You're back?\"\n\nThe old Daoist was cleaning the bookstore. Seeing Zhou Ze return, he immediately came over and flattered him, then said, \"Good people are blessed by heaven.\"\n\nImmediately after, the old Daoist saw the monkey behind him and was instantly amused. \"You even brought a pet back?\"\n\nAs he spoke,\nthe old Daoist struck a pose like the Monkey King and shouted, \"What use is this iron rod to me!\"\n\nUnexpectedly, the little monkey actually cooperated and also struck a pose of scratching its ears and cheeks, one hand pointing at the old Daoist, the other scratching itself.\n\n\"Heh, this monkey is smart, like me.\"\n\nAfter saying that, the old Daoist felt as if he had said something wrong.\n\nJust as they entered the shop, a woman came down the stairs.\n\nFirst to appear were a pair of flesh-colored stockings, long, slender legs, an exquisite high school girl's uniform, and long, flowing hair.\n\nTang Shi had almost fully recovered and could walk now.\n\nWomen all love beauty; the first thing to do after recovering mobility was to doll herself up.\n\nOn this point, Zhou Ze felt Bai Yingying was much more plain. This silly big girl, apart from liking to play games, didn't really care much for dressing up.\n\n\"If you didn't come back, we'd all have to leave,\" Tang Shi smiled. \"When the 'dog' isn't around, the 'doghouse' loses its scent, and we won't be able to stay hidden⁹.\"\n\n\"I just got back, can you say something nice?\" Zhou Ze was truly at a loss for words with this woman.\n\n\"Alright, I'll say something nice. The noodle shop owner next door told me everything that happened that day. Do you know what you provoked?\"\n\n\"I think it's called Qingyi Niangniang,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"A temple deity, a temple deity about to be completely overthrown, you actually proactively provoked her? Do you know she doesn't have much time left¹⁰, and she also knows she doesn't have much time left?\"\n\n\"She was killing people.\"\n\n\"Do you know who she was killing?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the monkey still playing with the old Daoist, shook his head, and said, \"I'm not interested in knowing.\"\n\nTang Shi walked up to Zhou Ze, then covered her nose and said with disdain, \"You really stink.\"\n\n\"That's why they call them stinky men.\"\n\n\"Were you always this glib¹¹?\" Tang Shi didn't get angry either.\n\n\"Before, you were lying there like a mummy, who'd be interested in being glib with you?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the bathroom and said to Bai Yingying, \"Help me take a bath.\"\n\nBai Yingying was stunned for a moment,\n\nBut the silly big girl still immediately replied, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\nIn Zhou Ze's current condition, it was impossible for him to bathe himself, but his body was covered in layers upon layers of mud, and it felt uncomfortable not to bathe.\n\nLet Xu Qinglang help him bathe?\n\nHe couldn't even bear to think about it.\n\nLet the old Daoist help him bathe?\n\nJust imagining the old Daoist singing \"Xintianyou\"¹² while scrubbing his back, and then looking at the old Daoist's skeletal body, there was nothing appealing about that.\n\nAs for Tang Shi, forget it. If he asked her to help him bathe, she'd probably rather \"whoosh\" a pen to give him a swift end.\n\nOnly the simple and kind Bai Yingying remained.\n\nEntering the bathroom, Zhou Ze sat on a stool. Bai Yingying helped him undress; she herself didn't take off her clothes, so the bathing scene was not as titillating as one might imagine.\n\nHolding the showerhead, little by little, she washed away the mud on Zhou Ze's body. Seeing the scars covering Zhou Ze's entire body, Bai Yingying was so surprised her mouth hung open and asked, \"Boss, your injuries are too horrifying. That Qingyi Niangniang is really a monster¹³. I heard her temple has been torn down, serves her right.\"\n\n\"She didn't do it,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Actually, most of the injuries on my body were self-inflicted.\"\n\nZhou Ze found it hard to understand that state, and didn't even know if he could actively enter that state again, but what was certain was that if he were to repeat what happened on the rooftop again, he would still end up covered in scars.\n\nThis body of his, to be honest, was a bit too weak.\n\nBai Yingying began to apply body wash to Zhou Ze, her hands moving across Zhou Ze's body.\n\nUnconsciously, a look of intoxication appeared on her face, and at the same time, she said, \"Boss, I don't know why, when I touch your body, I really like this feeling, it's a very intimate feeling.\"\n\nAs a zombie, Bai Yingying sensed a kinship from Zhou Ze's current state, and although this kindred spirit seemed very weak, the suppression and disparity in their ranks made her instinctively feel an urge to submit.\n\nShe had felt this way before, when she was holding Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Just wash properly, don't mess around.\"\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang coughed once outside the bathroom.\n\nBai Yingying's body stiffened for a moment. Her fingertips began to rub back and forth over the two protruding points on Zhou Ze's chest, with great speed.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Xu Meiren¹⁴ and I made a bet; we wanted to see if the boss could actually get hard¹⁵.\"\n\nAs she spoke,\nBai Yingying also lowered her head,\ndeliberately looking down,\nthen she suddenly opened her mouth wide and let out a gasp of surprise: \"Boss, you actually...\"\n---\n¹ **110**: China's police emergency number.\n² **police uncles**: A respectful and familiar term for police officers in China.\n³ **makeshift king**: Literally 'straw-head king', an idiom referring to a temporary or informal leader.\n⁴ **motley crew of subordinates**: Literally 'cat soldiers and dog generals', an idiom for a disorganized or ineffectual group of subordinates.\n⁵ **hideous fanged face**: Literally 'green face and fangs', an idiom describing a fierce and frightening appearance, often associated with demons.\n⁶ **Keep being mischievous**: The original Chinese word '皮' (pí) can mean naughty, mischievous, or disobedient.\n⁷ **grand-aunt**: The original Chinese '姑奶奶' (gūnainai) is a term for a paternal grand-aunt, but can also be used by a woman to refer to herself assertively or condescendingly.\n⁸ **secret room discipline**: The original Chinese '密室調教' (mìshì tiáojiào) refers to 'discipline/training in a secret room', often used in contexts implying BDSM or strict control/imprisonment, here used humorously for exaggerated indignation.\n⁹ **When the 'dog' isn't around, the 'doghouse' loses its scent, and we won't be able to stay hidden**: A sarcastic metaphor implying that with the 'boss' (Zhou Ze) absent, their 'shelter' or 'cover' is no longer effective.\n¹⁰ **doesn't have much time left**: The original Chinese '時日無多' (shírì wúduō) is an idiom typically used to describe someone or something that is near its end or has little time remaining.\n¹¹ **glib**: The original Chinese '口花花' (kǒu huāhuā) describes someone who is smooth-talking, flirtatious, or prone to saying playful but perhaps insincere things.\n¹² **Xintianyou**: A style of Chinese folk song, particularly popular in the northwestern regions.\n¹³ **monster**: The original Chinese '真不是東西' (zhēn bù shì dōngxi) is a strong insult, literally meaning 'really not a thing', implying someone is not human or is despicable.\n¹⁴ **Xu Meiren**: The original Chinese '許美人' (Xǔ Měirén) is a playful nickname; 'Meiren' literally means 'beautiful person' and is typically used for women.\n¹⁵ **get hard**: The original Chinese '石更' (shígèng) is a slang term for an erection, literally meaning 'stone hard'.",

    "content": "After bathing, Zhou Ze, dressed in a white shirt and casual pants, was carried out by Bai Yingying and placed on a mat on the second floor. When Bai Yingying came down, Xu Qinglang immediately came closer and asked:\n\n\"What's the situation?\"\n\nStealthily,\ncautiously,\nthis feeling was very much like the trepidation of operating an underground casino, as if the police would burst in to arrest gamblers at any moment.\n\nBai Yingying hesitated to speak, her face flushed.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned.\nYou're a zombie, why are you blushing, dammit.\n\n\"So, how was it?\" Xu Qinglang pressed, eager to know the answer.\n\n\"Uh...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Tell me, did it get hard?\" Xu Qinglang asked eagerly.\n\n\"This...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Could it be that he has a slit down there?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Or maybe his, when he took it out, wasn't even as big as yours?\"\n\n\"What...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Hey, stop beating around the bush. Don't you want to get the latest graphics card anymore?\"\n\n\"The Boss said that after the store moves, he'll get me a new, top-of-the-line PC,\" Bai Yingying said awkwardly.\n\n\"You were bought off?\" A black line appeared on Xu Qinglang's face.\n\n\"Yup.\" Bai Yingying was very honest.\n\n\"Wait, no. At most, he only has just over ten thousand in hand. He still needs to move and renovate, and I'm covering the rent for now. He doesn't have that much money.\"\n\n\"The Boss asked me for two jade hairpins and pawned them for 500,000. He said he'd return 750,000 to me in half a year.\"\n\n\"He conned you into pawning funerary objects?\" Xu Qinglang looked at her like she was an idiot. \"Are you stupid or not?! Those were your burial objects.\"\n\n\"The Boss said he'd return them to me,\" Bai Yingying mumbled.\n\n\"You believe everything he says? If he said he was your zombie ancestor, would you believe that too?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Bai Yingying said quietly.\nBecause she really did sense a zombie's aura on the Boss.\n\n\"You're hopeless, you silly girl.\" Xu Qinglang had a look of exasperated disappointment. \"Oh, by the way, let me ask you something: do you have any sisters?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I want to find a female zombie to be a maid too. It's a highly profitable business, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nBai Yingying straightened up.\nA chilling aura suddenly emanated from her.\nThe silly girl instantly transformed into an ice queen.\n\nXu Qinglang, who was still feeling sorry for himself, suddenly shivered.\nThat familiar sense of dread from their first meeting struck him again. Almost instinctively, Xu Qinglang once again turned into a little quail.\n\n\"Who did you say you wanted to take as a maid?\" the female corpse asked.\n\n\"Nothing, I said I'd go buy a new graphics card this afternoon and install it for you. That way you can play 'chicken'¹ on the highest graphics settings.\"\n\n…………\n\n\"Here, this is Lady Qingyi's information.\"\n\nTang Shi handed a tablet to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's hair was still damp at this point. He was leaning against the wall, sitting on the mat, looking like a handsome, languid man fresh out of the shower after playing basketball at university.\n\nXu Le had all sorts of flaws and was a good-for-nothing,\nbut you couldn't deny that Xu Le was indeed very good-looking,\notherwise, he wouldn't have been chosen by the Lin family's parents as their live-in son-in-law.\n\n\"For seeking children?\" Zhou Ze glanced at Lady Qingyi's information and said.\n\nLady Qingyi was a small local temple in Tongcheng. She did not exist in historical records, nor did she have a place in mainstream mythology. Even in Tongcheng, she was not a household name.\n\nHer popularity was not widespread. Some stories about her were mostly made up by later generations.\n\nJust as many scenic spots in Yangzhou's Slender West Lake are associated with Emperor Qianlong's tours to the Jiangnan region—as if Emperor Qianlong did nothing else during his tours to Jiangnan but was solely busy creating various stories in Slender West Lake to name these scenic spots.\n\nLady Qingyi's story was also a bit far-fetched. There's a town in Tongcheng called Lüsi. It's said that it got its name because Lü Dongbin visited here four times. And this Lady Qingyi was a widow Lü Dongbin met when he came to Tongcheng.\n\nThe widow had no children, did not remarry, and remained chaste for her deceased husband. She also loved children and was kind-hearted, so she took in many orphans, essentially an ancient orphanage or daycare. After Lü Dongbin discovered her, he gave her a green robe as encouragement.\n\nAfter she died, the local people, to commemorate her good deeds, erected a temple for her, named Lady Qingyi.\n\nMost people who came to this temple to offer incense were seeking children or the continuation of their family line,² similar to the effect of Guanyin, the Giver of Sons.\n\nHowever, it was mentioned at the bottom that due to old town redevelopment, Lady Qingyi's temple had been demolished.\n\nAs for rebuilding, it would be difficult. Firstly, she wasn't as famous as Mazu. Secondly, the difficulty of building a new temple was indeed very high. Developers wouldn't add work difficulty to themselves. Although some local elderly people objected, the temple was ultimately demolished.\n\nThe information included a photo from a few years ago. In the photo, Lady Qingyi's temple was already dilapidated. Even the head of the statue of the deity had fallen off years ago, leaving only a headless sculpture standing there.\n\nThis, however, matched the image of the headless woman.\n\n\"A temple deity, so-called, is a soul embryo formed by faith and incense offerings,\" Tang Shi explained. \"Just like the Faceless Woman who once came to test you, she was formed from the grievances of the departed on the Yellow Springs Road.\"\n\n\"She knew her temple body was about to be torn down, and that she would soon cease to exist, so she came out to kill and vent her anger?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Temple deities have their own codes of conduct. Even in their final madness, they would never strike aimlessly.\"\n\n\"I know this, I've checked.\" Xu Qinglang came up from the stairwell at this moment. \"The girl whose head was cut off by the ceiling fan had three abortions at the hospital. Lady Qingyi was deliberately carrying out her final punishment according to her own code of conduct.\"\n\n\"Punishment?\" Zhou Ze countered. \"Who gave her the authority to do that?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shrugged. \"Everyone's perspective is different, and their stance naturally differs. In her eyes, a child is a life. Having an abortion for no reason, or an irresponsible abortion, is inherently a desecration of life.\"\n\n\"So, if I hadn't accidentally run into her, she would have continued to find such people and cause their accidental deaths?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"That should be the case.\" Tang Shi nodded. \"She has already gone mad and become possessed. Anyone, when they reach the end of their rope, will go crazy, even if she is a temple deity.\"\n\n\"I've always wondered something. Why did she only let the women die, Old Zhou? Do you remember the noodle shop girl's boyfriend? Why was he fine?\nCould it be that Lady Qingyi also favors males over females?\"\n\n\"So, the most pitiful one is still that student boyfriend.\"\nZhou Ze gave the answer.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned by the remark.\nA look of sudden realization appeared on his face, and he said:\n\"When will my mind be as brilliant as yours?\"\n\n\"In any case, next time you can take things a bit slower,\" Tang Shi reminded him. \"Desperate characters, or these kinds of temple deities, don't interfere with them next time. Whatever she does, her past merits will offset it; it's not your fault if something goes wrong.\"\n\n\"It's not about whether I want to interfere or not; it's that I just happened to run into it, so...\"\n\nAfter thinking for a moment,\nZhou Ze thought of the monkey from back then,\nand instantly felt no desire to explain further. He just waved his hand and said, \"Never mind, let's not talk about it.\"\n\nTang Shi, however, smiled sweetly at this moment and said: \"I originally thought you were different from him. Now I suddenly realize that you are essentially the same.\"\n\n\"I don't want to follow his path. By the way, are your injuries healed?\"\n\n\"Almost completely healed.\"\n\n\"Then what are you still doing here? Aren't you going to help your friend? I can book you a plane ticket to Rongcheng.\"\n\n\"Whether I go or not, it won't make much difference. The outcome won't change because I go. Besides, I believe he can return.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was about to leave at this moment, when he suddenly remembered something and said: \"Oh, right, the store matters over there have all been handled. We can move anytime.\"\n\n\"Let me recover a bit more first,\" Zhou Ze said.\nHe certainly didn't want to sit in a wheelchair to look after the store's business.\n\n\"Alright, then. Take good care of yourself, and be careful not to get wet.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went downstairs.\n\nTang Shi was still standing there. With a flick of her finger, a White Rabbit candy peeled itself and flew into her mouth.\n\nThen, chewing, she asked Zhou Ze:\n\"Something seems to have changed with you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"But I still need to remind you to take good care of this body. Because for us, returning from hell and choosing a body is a one-time opportunity. Once this body is ruined, you'll become a wandering spirit.\"\n\n\"Are there no exceptions?\" Zhou Ze frowned. He wasn't particularly fond of this body. Although he had gotten used to it, there were always some unspeakable difficulties.\n\nEspecially when facing Doctor Lin.\n\nTang Shi thought for a moment and said: \"That person seems to have the ability to change bodies, but he's just a special case. For us, there's only one, single chance.\"\n\n\"You seem to be in a good mood today.\" Zhou Ze noticed that Tang Shi was a bit more talkative today.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't so narcissistic as to think that the woman was exceptionally happy and talkative because he had returned safely.\n\n\"He sent a message. There will be a result at the end of the month.\"\n\n\"Oh, so the 'Waiting-for-Husband Stone'³ received news and is overjoyed.\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched. \"I hope he can have a 'small universe explosion'⁴ over there, kill all those ghost messengers, faceless women, and whatever else. Even if he has to self-destruct in the end, he should drag them down with him. That way, I can continue to live my peaceful little life.\"\n\nThe little loli and the Faceless Woman were like the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head.\n\n\"When things over there are settled, he might also come here. By then, perhaps you two could even become neighbors.\"\n\nHeh, woman.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze didn't have much confidence that that person could return safely from Rongcheng. But he also knew that for Tang Shi in front of him, she was no longer listening to any rational words.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow this line of conversation and continued:\n\"Alright then, we could even form a group. Doesn't Marvel have something called 'The Avengers'? We could have one too.\n\n'The Hell Visitors League'?\n'The Hell-bound League'?\"\n\n\"It's too obviously bandwagoning, and tacky.\" Tang Shi was clearly not satisfied with this name.\n\n\"Heh, then you suggest one.\"\n\n\"'The Anorexic League,' how about that?\"\n\n---\n¹ **吃雞 (chī jī)**: Literally \"eat chicken,\" slang for playing battle royale games like PUBG, where \"chicken dinner\" is the victory phrase.\n² **香火不斷 (xiānghuǒ bùduàn)**: Literally \"incense never stops,\" refers to the continuation of a family line, ensuring descendants to carry on ancestral worship.\n³ **望夫石 (wàngfū shí)**: Literally \"waiting-for-husband stone,\" a mythical rock where a wife waited for her husband until she turned to stone, symbolizing eternal longing and waiting.\n⁴ **小宇宙爆發 (xiǎoyǔzhòu bàofā)**: Literally \"small universe explosion,\" a term from the Japanese manga *Saint Seiya*, referring to a sudden, immense burst of inner power or potential.",

    "content": "A week later, Xu Qinglang’s noodle shop and Zhou Ze’s bookstore were both set to move tomorrow, but Xu Qinglang still opened his noodle shop tonight, saying he planned to do business here for one last day.\n\nIt was hard to leave his homeland; this noodle shop also carried a long period of Xu Qinglang’s life, and even his last moments with his parents.\n\nIf it weren’t for the little loli’s intervention, perhaps Xu Qinglang could still “dine” with his parents every night, enjoying the warmth of a family together.\n\nZhou Ze’s bookstore, on the other hand, was already closed. All the books inside had been packed into boxes, just waiting for the truck to come tomorrow to transport them away.\n\nWith Bai Yingying, a laborer strong as an ox, and Tang Shi, an “object manipulator”¹, the efficiency of packing was indeed very high. Boss Zhou, whose injuries were mostly healed but not completely recovered, only needed to sit in the adjacent noodle shop, holding a teapot and drinking tea, much resembling an old-school landlord from the old society.\n\nOld Daoist and Monkey were playing in the deserted mall behind. Monkey was very fond of Old Daoist; the man and the monkey could indeed play together.\n\nThere was no forest here, but the empty commercial center behind was enough for Monkey to run wild and have fun.\n\nDrinking tea, watching the sun slowly set outside, Xu Qinglang sat there looking at his phone, showing little sadness, and certainly not much joy.\n\nFortunately, a customer finally came in at this moment.\n\nThis was today’s first customer,\n\nand as expected,\n\nthis would also be today’s last customer.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze’s last taxi ride where he asked the driver to find him an “unclean” place, and the driver ended up here, whatever tiny bit of popularity this place still had was long gone.\n\nPeople who used to pass by here on their way to or from work also chose to change their route and detour.\n\nThis was also why Zhou Ze decided to move.\n\nThe newcomer was dressed in a suit, but his hair was disheveled, and his suit was somewhat dirty. He didn’t look like an office worker, but rather like an unemployed wanderer, yet the suit itself was quite expensive.\n\n“What would you like to eat?” Xu Qinglang asked, rising.\n\n“Stir-fry a few of your best dishes, and a bottle of Snowflake beer, chilled.”\n\n“Alright.”\n\nXu Qinglang first got him the beer and then went to the kitchen to stir-fry the dishes.\n\nThe man sat opposite Zhou Ze, across an aisle.\n\nThe man glanced at the noodle shop and said:\n\n“You’re moving, aren’t you?”\n\n“You can tell?” Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\n“I can tell. It’s just been cleaned. Who would bother cleaning so meticulously when opening a shop in this Godforsaken place? This clearly means you’re preparing to move out.”\n\nThe man took out a cigarette, lit it, and then flicked the ash directly onto the dining table.\n\nA moment later, Xu Qinglang brought over the first dish. The man looked at the dish, shook his head, and said:\n\n“Boss, your cooking really isn’t as good-looking as you are.”\n\n“Eat your food.” Xu Qinglang replied indifferently.\n\nA man with over twenty apartments doing business just had this kind of temper.\n\nThe man picked up his chopsticks, took a bite, and then spat it out. “This dish isn’t made with heart, it’s not authentic.”\n\nXu Qinglang had already returned to the kitchen to stir-fry the next dish, so he didn't hear the man's mumbling.\n\n“I think his cooking is pretty good,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“Pretty good?” The man reached out and lightly tapped the table. “Cooking and making food as a hobby, can that be called pretty good?”\n\nAfter speaking, the man bit open the beer cap with his teeth, gulped down a large mouthful, and said: “I can taste it. It’s clear you’re not short on money, the type who cooks to experience life. This dish has no sincerity at all.”\n\n“It’s hard to find a sincere restaurant nowadays.”\n\n“Oh, what’s your relationship? I said his food wasn’t good, why are you suddenly targeting me?”\n\nThe man pointed at Zhou Ze, then at the kitchen, and smiled silently,\n\n“Oh, something’s up, something’s up.”\n\nZhou Ze couldn’t be bothered to deal with this guy. The reason he had engaged him earlier was that the fellow looked somewhat familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before.\n\nOf course, it must have been something from his previous life.\n\n“Disgusting? Do you find me disgusting? Disgusting people live more comfortably. I, however, think your life certainly isn’t that comfortable. Sitting there with a cup of tea, you look very self-cultivated, but you’re also someone who likes to meddle.\n\nPeople, if they like to meddle, their lives won’t be comfortable.”\n\nThe man took another sip of wine, looking at Zhou Ze with a smile.\n\n“By the way, the bookstore next door, that should be yours, right? Is it closing too?” The man pointed to the next door. “When I just came over, I saw everything inside the glass door was already packed.”\n\n“Yes, we’re moving.”\n\n“Did you sue?” the man asked, squinting.\n\n“Sue for what?”\n\n“Sue the developers here, sue the management here! I’ve heard that things have been happening here one after another; it’s clearly the management’s negligence.\n\nFirst, there was the movie theater fire,\n\nthen people jumping to their deaths,\n\nwhich led to your businesses being unable to continue. Sue them! Make them compensate you for your losses!”\n\n“Your theory is quite novel,” Zhou Ze said, finding it both funny and exasperating.\n\nNot to mention that Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, due to their special identities, had no intention of claiming any losses from here; even if they were normal people, it would probably be difficult to think of seeking compensation from this situation.\n\n“What’s novel about it? If there’s a law, follow it! Chinese people just don’t like to sue, but I’m telling you, this lawsuit can be fought, and you can get compensation.\n\nEven if you pluck a single hair from that cinema company, it’ll be thicker than our waists².\n\nI can help you fight this lawsuit. I happen to be short on money, so I won’t charge you lawyer fees; we’ll split the compensation received fifty-fifty. Don’t worry, it won’t be a small amount; if it were, I wouldn’t take this on.”\n\n“Go away, go away! Who has time to fight this lawsuit with you? Besides, people’s family members died; is it appropriate for us to run over and demand compensation for losses from them?”\n\nXu Qinglang was getting a bit annoyed with this guy.\n\n“Is being appropriate useful? Can being appropriate get you money? You were appropriate, and your business still couldn’t continue, so you’re preparing to move, aren’t you?”\n\nThe man took another sip of wine; the bottle of beer was already empty.\n\n“Why wouldn’t you want money? Are you stupid?!”\n\n“Is your surname Du?” Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\nThe man froze, then looked at Zhou Ze. “Oh, you actually recognize me.”\n\n“Old Zhou, you know him?” Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. “A great lawyer.”\n\n“Him, a great lawyer?” Xu Qinglang laughed so hard tears almost came out. “He’s clearly a shyster lawyer³.”\n\n“He really is a great lawyer,” Zhou Ze repeated.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that his hospital had previously had two medical malpractice incidents caused by new drugs. The patients sued, and finally, the hospital hired this Lawyer Du, who perfectly won the lawsuits.\n\nHe was from Tongcheng, but previously had his own law firm in Shanghai. He was considered a very famous professional lawyer in the industry, with a very high success rate.\n\nHowever, back then, his fees were extremely expensive. Aside from major tycoons and large corporations, ordinary people simply couldn’t afford his lawyer fees.\n\n“Since you recognize me, you should know how powerful I am at fighting lawsuits. Come on, hire me for this case; you’ll have money to open a new shop, and I’m short on cash.”\n\nLawyer Du looked at Zhou Ze, with an expression that said, ‘Hurry up and beg me.’\n\n“Sorry, we’re not interested,” Zhou Ze still refused.\n\n“No interest in RMB? Are you perhaps interested in冥币 (ghost money)⁴?”\n\nLawyer Du held his stomach and laughed,\n\nthen stood up,\n\npointed at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang,\n\n“Don’t want money? You two big idiots.”\n\nAfter speaking, he felt in his pocket, took out a hundred-yuan bill, and placed it on the table,\n\n“The food really is terrible. Keep the change.”\n\nWith that, he picked up the remaining half-bottle of beer and staggered out of the shop.\n\n“This guy must be crazy,” Xu Qinglang said while clearing the table. “Never mind, let’s close up. From now on, we’ll just make coffee and pastries.”\n\n“He used to be quite formidable,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“You admire him that much?”\n\n“It’s not admiration. In any industry, to reach a top level in a region, especially in a place like Shanghai, he truly is a capable person with real skill.\n\nDo you know what his most famous case was?”\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n“A case of a minor committing murder in a home. Even with abundant evidence from the prosecution, the suspect’s family paid a hefty sum to hire him as the defense lawyer,\n\nand in the end, he truly succeeded in winning the case, and the suspect was acquitted.”\n\n“So, did that child actually commit murder?” Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “He probably did.”\n\n“Someone so greedy for money, can they still get by in the industry?”\n\n“They’ll only get by better, because what tycoons and large corporations need are lawyers who can help them win lawsuits and protect their interests, not just lawyers who talk about conscience.”\n\n“I understand that principle.” Xu Qinglang stretched, then curiously pointed at the figure slowly staggering away outside, still drinking and making a drunken scene, and said:\n\n“Then how did this guy end up like this⁵, even purposely coming to our door to pester us to let him fight a lawsuit for us?”\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of tea,\n\nand slowly said:\n\n“Later, that acquitted minor committed murder in a home again,\n\nand by a strange twist of fate,\n\nthe home he entered,\n\nwas this Lawyer Du’s house.\n\nHis wife and daughter, on that day,\n\nwere killed.”\n___\n¹ \"控物\" (kòng wù) literally means \"control objects,\" implying telekinesis or similar abilities.\n² \"腰身粗\" (yāoshēn cū) literally means \"thicker than our waists,\" implying \"much more substantial\" or \"a much bigger sum.\"\n³ \"訟棍\" (sònggùn) literally means \"litigation stick/rod,\" a derogatory term for a lawyer who manipulates the law for personal gain, often unethical.\n⁴ \"冥币\" (míngbì) refers to \"ghost money\" or \"hell money,\" paper money burned as an offering to the deceased in some East Asian cultures.\n⁵ \"混成這個吊樣\" (hùn chéng zhège diàoyàng) is an informal, somewhat vulgar phrase meaning \"ended up in such a pathetic/terrible state.\"",

    "content": "The new store opened, brimming with cheer.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, the store's renovation, rent, and all other conceivable expenses were not actually paid by him.\n\nXu Qinglang paid half, and the other half came from Bai Yingying's burial offerings.\n\nOf course, Xu Qinglang was preparing to \"semi-retire\" and only planned to sell coffee and make small pastries in the bookstore, living a healthy lifestyle.\n\nThe task of making money would now fall solely to Zhou Ze.\n\nFortunately, no one doubted Zhou Ze's ability to make money. The new store was located on South Street, a place with high human traffic, and presumably no shortage of ghost traffic either.\n\nAs long as Boss Zhou upheld the dedicated spirit of fearing neither hardship nor late nights, continuously sending these self-delivered ghosts to hell for reform and rebirth, earning piles and piles of hell money shouldn't be a big problem.\n\nWhen that time came, everyone could just squat at the bookstore entrance, burn paper money, and wait for people to drop their wallets. They wouldn't even need to pay bank transaction fees.\n\nThe bookstore's overall color scheme was soft, muted tones. The bookshelves inside were not densely packed. Newspapers and magazines, which updated quickly, were on a separate shelf, novels on another, and other more serious books in a dedicated area.\n\nAs for study aids and similar items, Zhou Ze did not restock them.\n\nThe bookstore had a second floor, where three rooms and a bathroom were partitioned off, serving as their living quarters.\n\nOn the first day of opening, there were no firecrackers or fireworks, no flower baskets or salute cannons. Everything appeared simple and peaceful.\n\nThe Old Taoist, being sensible, cleaned with Bai Yingying, while Zhou Ze sat behind the bar counter, savoring the cocktail Xu Qinglang had just mixed.\n\nHe took a sip, set the glass down. Little Monkey picked up the glass, secretly took a sip, then found it utterly disgusting, continuously sticking out his tongue.\n\nTang Shi was alone in her bedroom upstairs. She was a homebody; if there was nothing to do, she could stay in her room all day and not feel bored.\n\nOnce everything was tidied up and they were truly ready to welcome customers, it was already after dusk; the sky had darkened.\n\nBai Yingying held the plaque with one hand and hung up the \"Late Night Bookstore\" sign. Then she jumped down, clapped her hands, and smiled contentedly after confirming it was hung perfectly straight.\n\nAfterward, she followed her boss's instructions and hung and secured the two couplet plaques, \"Listen at your own discretion\" and \"As I have heard\", on the left and right sides respectively. These were the signs brought back from the old store.\n\nBai Yingying had asked Zhou Ze about the meaning of \"Listen at your own discretion\" and \"As I have heard\". Zhou Ze explained that they were simply stories he had heard himself, told for everyone to listen to. They did not represent his own views, and everyone could simply listen for entertainment, no need to take them seriously.\n\nThe bookstore still did business with the dead, while business with the living was merely a bonus. After all, not far from South Street was \"Tongcheng Bookstore,\" a large bookstore specializing in physical books. Competing with it would be incredibly difficult and utterly unnecessary.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when he was a child, \"Tongcheng Bookstore\" was considered the most influential bookstore in the hearts of Tongcheng people. But in recent years, with the continuous compression and downturn of the physical book market, Tongcheng Bookstore had also reduced its operating area, appearing much shabbier compared to its heyday.\n\nOne could only say that the widespread adoption of smartphones and screen reading had gradually made most people forget the habit of reading with the scent of ink and paper.\n\nWith everything complete and business ready to begin, the next step was to wait for customers.\n\nIn fact, customers arrived quickly. From 7 PM when they officially opened until now, several batches of customers had already come, but they were all living people who ordered coffee or other drinks, sitting there to rest their feet and chat.\n\nWhen living people arrived, Zhou Ze simply didn't move. Xu Qinglang, on the other hand, was constantly greeting guests and mixing drinks, bustling non-stop.\n\nBy the time these customers left, it was already 9:30 PM. Xu Qinglang took a sip of water, looked at Zhou Ze swaying in the rocking chair, and immediately felt a strong sense of imbalance!\n\n\"Old Zhou, I think we should put up a sign that says, 'No living persons allowed.' What do you think?\"\n\n\"Then the Bureau of Industry and Commerce will be knocking on our door tomorrow,\" Zhou Ze unhesitatingly rejected Xu Qinglang's suggestion.\n\n\"But I feel this is more tiring than when I ran a noodle shop,\" Xu Qinglang complained, his face full of grievance.\n\nWhen he ran his noodle shop, not many people actually ate in the store; most orders were for food delivery. If he wanted to rest, he could simply turn off the food delivery app. But now, customers had walked in; he couldn't exactly kick them out, could he?\n\n\"Look, here comes one.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked outside the door.\n\nIt seemed that due to the locational advantage, today's real business had arrived quickly.\n\nEntering was an old woman, leaning on a cane, thin and somewhat shriveled. Her eyes were wide open, as if unwilling to close in death.\n\nThe old woman carried a faint trace of resentment, which meant she still had some lingering attachments, preventing her from going to hell or entering reincarnation.\n\nHowever, this bit of resentment was far from enough to turn her into a vengeful ghost. She still belonged to the category of \"harmless to humans and animals\" ghosts.\n\n\"Prepare the meal then,\" Zhou Ze told Xu Qinglang.\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang didn't complain about being tired or suffering. In fact, preparing meals for those about to be sent to hell was his own suggestion.\n\nHe felt that Zhou Ze's previous actions of directly sending ghosts to hell were too simple and crude, without any foreplay, too blunt and lacking in service quality.\n\nTherefore, he suggested preparing some food and seeing them off before sending people to hell. That way, they might leave more hell money. It was the same principle as how movie theaters, besides ticket sales, also made big profits from selling cola and popcorn.\n\nThe meal was simple: a plate of dried radish, a plate of peanuts, a bowl of rice with chopsticks stuck upright, and a cup of old yellow wine.\n\nAll these items were pre-prepared, just needed plating, so it wasn't troublesome.\n\nThe Old Taoist set up a small table, prepared a small stool, and drew the curtain to block the outside view. Otherwise, if other customers came in and saw this scene, they might be scared out of their wits.\n\nThis was like a small private room, a small private room specifically prepared for ghosts.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, holding his teacup, and said to the old woman, \"Please.\"\n\nThe old woman hesitated. One could tell she was a little scared, but she feared Zhou Ze even more. At once, she tremblingly sat down.\n\nXu Qinglang handed the Old Taoist a bottle of ox tears diluted with talisman water. The Old Taoist applied it to his eyes and also saw the old woman.\n\nTo be honest, the Old Taoist hadn't encountered such \"opening doors to welcome ghosts\" business since leaving the underworld shop. For a moment, he felt nostalgic and couldn't help but think of his boss, who was still in Rongcheng.\n\nBut it would be soon.\n\nThe Old Taoist had already sent a notification to his followers in his live streaming room, which had been dormant for several months. He would resume live streaming on April 1st, midnight, or roughly after 00:20 AM on March 31st.\n\nThat day was when his boss said he would return.\n\nBai Yingying also brought a small stool and sat over. The old woman felt a little shy. A zombie, a ghost messenger, a mystic practitioner, plus an Old Taoist whose crotch seemed to be steaming—\n\nThe old woman felt immensely overwhelmed.\n\nHer slight bit of resentment truly seemed insignificant among this pack of wolves.\n\n\"Eat up. After you eat, you can be on your way.\"\n\nZhou Ze urged.\n\nThe old woman smiled, lowered her head, and began to eat.\n\nIt was like how a tiger is terrifying, but a tiger facing its zookeeper in a zoo acts like a kitten.\n\nIf the old woman were to go out and accidentally be glimpsed by someone, it would likely scare them sick or make them faint. But at this moment, she could only obediently eat.\n\n\"Madam, how did you die?\" the Old Taoist began to ask.\n\nThe Old Taoist was an active person; even at his advanced age, the older he got, the more he talked.\n\nHe often spoke to Little Monkey, telling him how five hundred years ago he subjugated demons and suppressed a great mischievous monkey under the Five Fingers Mountain, and so on;\n\nLittle Monkey also played along. As long as the Old Taoist bought some snacks, Little Monkey could sit there and listen to the Old Taoist brag for a whole afternoon, occasionally waving his hand to indicate:\n\n\"Speak good, wow!\"\n\n\"San peng si li.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist was confused. He knew the old woman was speaking in dialect, so he looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Died of illness,\" Zhou Ze translated.\n\nTongcheng dialect was very different from Mandarin.\n\n\"Madam, this won't do. Even if you're a ghost, you can't forget to study. You still need to learn Mandarin well. Otherwise, when you get to hell, think about it, there are so many people on the Road to the Underworld, it'll be hard to find someone who speaks Tongcheng dialect. Won't it be so boring with no one to chitchat with on the way?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist kindly reminded her.\n\nThe old woman was a little embarrassed and could only lower her head to eat.\n\n\"Do you have children?\" the Old Taoist asked again.\n\n\"Yu guo o te.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze again, meaning, *hurry up and translate*.\n\n\"Has a daughter,\" Xu Qinglang translated.\n\n\"Then your daughter must have burned a lot of paper money for you, right?\" The Old Taoist rubbed his hands.\n\nThe old woman froze for a moment at his words, then said with a bitter smile, \"Family conditions are not good.\" (Xu Qinglang translated)\n\n\"Family conditions are not good?\" The Old Taoist was not discouraged and continued, \"It's fine, anyway, paper money isn't expensive. As long as your child cares about you, there can be more paper money.\"\n\n\"Lying on the sickbed, no money for treatment,\" (Xu Qinglang translated) the old woman said, putting down her chopsticks and wiping away tears.\n\n\"How pitiful,\" the Old Taoist wiped away tears along with her.\n\nBai Yingying also pursed her lips, feeling a little unwell.\n\n\"My daughter, by my hospital bed, asked me if I wanted to continue spending money on treatment. I was lying in bed, unable to speak or move. She cried and told me that if I didn't want to continue treatment, I should just blink once. If I didn't blink, she would sell everything she owned to continue my treatment.\"\n\n\"This daughter, she's not bad either,\" the Old Taoist said. \"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I blinked, then I went home from the hospital, and then I died,\" the old woman continued to wipe away tears.\n\n\"It's not easy for you either. You also considered your children, truly great. It's not easy for anyone; children also need to live,\" the Old Taoist grieved along with her.\n\nIn fact, such things are common in reality, especially when facing incurable diseases, which means constantly throwing money into them, and many families cannot afford such a method of treatment.\n\n\"Madam, you are very great,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"I'll pour you another drink,\" Xu Qinglang offered.\n\nMeanwhile, watching everyone around him with tear-brimming eyes, Zhou Ze didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nHe pointed at the old woman's eyes, which had been staring wide open as if unwilling to close in death since she entered, and asked:\n\n\"How did you blink?\"\n\nAt his words, the old woman,\n\nstopped crying,\n\nand immediately said fiercely:\n\n\"She asked me,\n\nMom, I ask you, if you don't want to continue treatment, just blink. If you don't blink, I will sell everything I own to continue your treatment.\n\nThen,\n\nafter waiting five minutes,\n\nI really couldn't hold it in anymore,\n\nand blinked.\n\nShe immediately began wiping her tears, saying:\n\nOkay,\n\nMom,\n\nI know what you mean,\n\nwe won't treat it anymore.\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n*   ¹ **Listen at your own discretion (姑妄聽之)**: A Chinese idiom implying to listen to something with an open mind but without necessarily believing or taking it seriously; \"take it with a grain of salt.\"\n*   ² **As I have heard (如是我聞)**: A phrase from Buddhist sutras, meaning \"Thus have I heard,\" indicating that the following text is a record of what the Buddha's disciple Ananda heard directly from the Buddha.

    "content": "After the old woman's last words were translated by Xu Qinglang, the crowd, who had previously been deeply moved, were left utterly bewildered.\n\nDamn it!\n\nWhat happened to the promised chicken soup story of \"I for my children, my children for me,\" and motherly love and filial piety?\n\nWhy the twist?\n\nZhou Ze clapped his hands and asked, \"Finished eating?\"\n\nThe unspoken meaning was:\n\nIf you've finished, it's time to hit the road.\n\nThe old woman put down her chopsticks somewhat shyly, saying,\n\n\"I don't know how I ended up here. I don't want to go down. I still want to...\"\n\nZhou Ze watched her silently,\n\nA smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.\n\nCustomer is king.\n\nCustomer requests must be listened to with a smile.\n\nThe old woman's body stiffened, scared into a shiver,\n\nShe immediately said,\n\n\"I think it's better for me to go down earlier.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt he should put up some slogans in this small private room:\n\n\"Leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist.\"\n\n\"That seems a bit too serious, or maybe I could put up:\"\n\n\"Reform diligently, become a new person.\"\n\nThese thoughts in his mind only brought a knowing smile to himself. Zhou Ze stood up, opened the Gates of Hell, and the old woman was still hesitating, but Zhou Ze directly grabbed her shoulder with one hand and threw her in.\n\nJust like that,\n\nThe new store's first order was completed.\n\nNext, Zhou Ze bent down to look under the small table and saw a small stack of ghost money.\n\n\"Count it and see if there's more than before?\" Xu Qinglang urged.\n\n\"It seems there's a bit more,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"That means this method is feasible. I told you, the profit margin for additional services is the largest. Can't we set up some other projects?\"\n\nEven with over twenty apartments, Xu Qinglang's desire to make money remained as strong as ever.\n\nNo one dislikes having too much money.\n\n\"How about a massage? Or a spa?\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"That's going too far,\" Xu Qinglang frowned.\n\n\"Some funeral homes now offer this kind of service, giving spa massages to the dead. I've seen it before: in a glass partition, family members stand outside watching as a technician bathes and massages the corpse inside, providing a full-service nail trim along with it.\"\n\n\"You're disgusting,\" Xu Qinglang said, looking as if he couldn't stand Zhou Ze, then turned to start clearing the dishes and chopsticks from the table.\n\nIn fact, none of the dishes had been touched, or at least they didn't look touched, but they still had to be thrown away.\n\nIf it were offerings of food or fruit used to commemorate one's ancestors at home, people could still eat them after the ritual; after all, it was something their own ancestors had \"eaten,\" and there was nothing wrong with everyone sharing a bowl of food at the table.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang and that old woman were unrelated, so of course, he couldn't eat her leftovers.\n\nAfter putting the ghost money into the cabinet, Zhou Ze sat back down in his armchair.\n\nHe rocked forward,\n\nrocked back,\n\nHe liked this comfort and enjoyed this leisurely pace.\n\nBai Yingying went upstairs to play on the computer, the old Taoist priest took the monkey upstairs to watch TV, and Xu Qinglang also went up to rest.\n\nTherefore, only Zhou Ze, the boss, was left on the first floor of the bookstore.\n\nHe picked up his phone, idly browsed through it, looking at news and so on. Outside, it had started raining without him noticing; the rain was quite heavy, changing from a sparse drizzle to a downpour.\n\nIn this season, it really could rain at any moment.\n\nHe picked up his water glass, took a sip, and when Zhou Ze stretched lazily and looked up again, he found a dense line of people standing at the entrance of his bookstore.\n\nOh!\n\nBusiness is so good today?\n\nThis was only the first night the new store was open. If business continued this way, Zhou Ze felt he wouldn't just quickly pay off the money he owed his maid; he could also immediately buy a good car.\n\nHmm, it's just that Xu Le, that good-for-nothing, doesn't even have a driver's license, so he'd still have to get one himself.\n\nWalking to the storefront, Zhou Ze paused, surprised to find that what was standing outside wasn't people, but rows of clothes.\n\nIt was people who originally sold clothes from stalls outside who had moved their stalls to his storefront to shelter from the rain. It was only due to some preconceived notions that Zhou Ze had just mistakenly thought there were ghostly shadows flickering outside.\n\nHe opened the store door.\n\nStanding outside the door were two young girls, around twenty years old, each with a wallet tucked into their waistbands and ponytails. They looked fresh and capable.\n\n\"Boss, sorry, we're blocking your business. We'll leave as soon as the rain lessens. Sorry, sorry,\" one girl apologized, bowing to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, do you have coffee? We'll buy two cups,\" the other girl, much more quick-witted, said. If they bought two cups of coffee here, the owner probably wouldn't feel right about asking them to leave.\n\n\"It's fine, you can leave when the rain stops,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't that unfeeling, plus his business was such that even if there was a steel plate blocking the outside, customers could still get in.\n\n\"Thank you, boss.\"\n\n\"Thank you, boss.\"\n\nThe two girls thanked Zhou Ze again.\n\nZhou Ze returned behind his bar. The upgraded bar area was indeed much more upscale and comfortable than the previous counter. The surround sound system was on, playing gentle music.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the rain showed no signs of letting up. One of the two girls selling clothes pushed open the bookstore door and walked in.\n\nThe girl walked to the bookshelf, picked out a few fashion magazines, then came over to Zhou Ze, ready to pay.\n\n\"Forty-eight,\" Zhou Ze said casually after glancing at the price. \"Give me fifty, no need for change.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe girl acknowledged him and handed Zhou Ze a fifty-yuan bill.\n\nZhou Ze took the money.\n\nA moment later,\n\nThe girl froze,\n\nIt seemed,\n\nsomething wasn't right.\n\nZhou Ze continued to lean back in his chair. The girl didn't dwell on the two yuan issue, but instead took her books and sat down on a small sofa in the store.\n\nOne of her companions was watching the stall outside, while she herself took a blank notebook and began sketching the clothes from the magazines.\n\nZhou Ze got up, poured a glass of orange juice, and brought it to her.\n\n\"It's free,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, boss.\"\n\n\"Studying design?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, we are students from Tongcheng University.\"\n\n\"University students coming out to set up stalls and do business, that's really good.\"\n\nZhou Ze praised them a couple of times. He wasn't some creepy uncle with ulterior motives, so he didn't continue the conversation. However, just as he reached the storefront, Zhou Ze suddenly saw the girl who had stayed outside to watch the clothes talking with a man dressed in black.\n\nBehind the man in black stood several others. They seemed a bit cold, shivering in the rain, but even so, they didn't move closer to shelter under the eaves.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the store door and walked over.\n\nThe man in black looked up, saw Zhou Ze, and then immediately lowered his head again.\n\nThe scantily clad people behind him immediately became timid and cowered, not daring to meet Zhou Ze's gaze at all.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to the man in black. The man was wearing a hat, with half his face hidden. Then, Zhou Ze turned his head and saw the girl who had handed out the clothes had a blank, hazy look in her eyes, and the money she had just received in her hand was a stack of worn ghost money.\n\n\"Isn't this going too far?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"We are all lonely wandering souls, originally on our way back to our hometowns, but with this rain, my brothers have no clothes on their backs and are truly very cold. We beg Your Honor to show us mercy.\"\n\n\"Wandering souls, hurry up and go to hell.\"\n\nZhou Ze's attitude was very stiff; he clearly had no intention of negotiating.\n\nWhat a joke.\n\nWandering souls are also performance!\n\nBoss Zhou was currently gearing up to boost his performance. Even a mosquito's leg is meat; he would never let go.\n\nIt seemed that choosing to change stores was the right decision. Look how lively it is tonight.\n\nThe man in black slowly lifted his head, revealing his scarred face, and said in a deep voice,\n\n\"Your Honor, are you not going to discuss this properly?\"\n\n\"What is there to discuss with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out, first grabbing the girl's shoulder and pulling her back, then stepped forward himself, standing in front of the man in black.\n\nHe extended his hand,\n\nand lightly poked the man in black's chest.\n\n\"You could try to make up a pitiful story to soften my heart,\n\nOh no,\n\nexcuse me, I forgot,\n\nmy conscience has temporarily eaten itself and hasn't been found yet.\"\n\n\"After I take them back to their hometowns, I will bring them back to hell. Your Honor, you can rest assured on that point!\"\n\nAlthough the man in black's face was covered in scars, his words were firm and authoritative, clearly in the manner of the leader of this group of minor ghosts.\n\n\"Do I have to buy a plane ticket and go back to your hometowns for a visit? Sorry, brother, I don't have time.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew long.\n\nBlack smoke slowly swirled out around him.\n\nAt this moment, the girl sitting inside the store looked up and glanced outside. She only saw her companion and the boss seemingly chatting, completely unaware of anything else she shouldn't be seeing.\n\n\"I cannot hand them over to you now; I must take them back first!\"\n\nThe man in black charged at Zhou Ze, full of menacing intent!\n\nBut the next second,\n\nZhou Ze simply flicked his arm,\n\nand the man in black was directly flung away. The sharpness carried by the fingernails made his soul somewhat unstable.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze chuckled twice.\n\nAn ordinary ghost,\n\nactually dared to actively attack him, an infernal envoy.\n\nThe man in black charged over again, but without exception, he was once again flung away by Zhou Ze.\n\nThis time, the several ghosts who had been standing there timidly immediately started to show signs of instability.\n\nZhou Ze had originally thought they would all come up to help their boss fight; that's what you call loyalty.\n\nOr,\n\nthese ghosts would quickly kneel down and beg him for mercy,\n\nthough begging for mercy wouldn't have much effect.\n\nBut they actually turned around and pounced on the black figure whose soul had begun to blur from being flung away twice in a row by Zhou Ze.\n\nThey were furious and began to devour and tear at this black figure.\n\nZhou Ze stood to the side, watching the spectacle and saying,\n\n\"It seems your subordinates have been pretty heavily exploited by you.\"\n\nEven though the man in black was currently being torn at, he still didn't let out any screams, and at the same time, he gravely retorted,\n\n\"They are criminals I was pursuing. My car and their car collided during the pursuit, and we all died in the accident.\n\nBut even in death,\n\nI will still seize them and bring them to the Public Security Bureau entrance at the scene of the crime to surrender!\"",

On the day of his funeral, he had entered Zhou Ze’s bookstore, and neither Zhou Ze nor Xu Qinglang could tell if he was alive or dead.\n\nThinking about it, he felt relieved.\n\nDirector Zhao was nearing retirement age, having diligently worked his post for most of his life, somewhat like Madam Bai who went to Hell earlier, having accumulated full merits.\n\nSuch people are truly exceptions among exceptions.\n\nIt’s like learning from Lei Feng and doing good deeds*. It’s precisely because Lei Feng is an exception in society that we need to learn from him. If everyone were a living Lei Feng, would there still be any need to learn?\n\n\"Come inside with me.\"\n\n…………\n\nIt was still raining outside. The girl who had been sitting in the bookstore copying from a magazine went out to check on her companion, finding her asleep leaning against a clothes rack. She immediately draped a jacket over her. The girl decided not to go back inside, staying outside to keep her company.\n\nThe two female university students, out setting up a stall to earn money, were like delicate wildflowers in this city, stubborn and resilient.\n\nFor them, it was an ordinary day: setting up their stall, encountering rain, taking shelter.\n\nThey couldn't possibly know what kind of business the bookstore they were sheltering in ran, nor did they remember that one of them had just nearly struck a deal with a ghost.\n\nInside the bookstore, Zhou Ze had again laid out some peanuts and crispy broad beans. The black-clad man sat opposite him, and the little devils stood trembling at the side.\n\n\"Thanks for the hospitality.\"\n\nThe black-clad man said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Finished eating? Time to go,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe man looked up at Zhou Ze; clearly, he was unwilling.\n\n\"They are already dead, and you have sacrificed yourself. All your responsibilities have been fulfilled. There's no need to stubbornly cling to that wisp of obsession and force yourself to take them away with you.\n\nWhat if something else goes wrong along the way, causing their departed souls to escape your control? This world would then have a few more lost souls, and perhaps even create other troubles.\"\n\nZhou Ze explained patiently.\n\nActually, there was only one central idea.\n\nI respect you.\n\nBut respect is respect, and work is work.\n\nYou have your obsession, but I also have my responsibility.\n\nThe living are your responsibility. The dead are mine.\n\n\"Then, may I ask you for a favor?\"\n\n\"You first.\"\n\n\"Help me investigate the cause of my death.\" The black-clad man raised his face, which was full of knife scars, looking exceptionally hideous at this moment. \"I was an undercover agent. Someone sold me out, otherwise I could have captured them alive and brought them to justice.\"\n\nThe black-clad man recalled that in the car, one person suddenly took a call, and the atmosphere instantly changed. He realized then that his identity had been exposed, and a struggle began in the car. Ultimately, the car plunged into a ravine, leading to the tragic car crash that killed everyone.\n\n\"That sounds like a plot from a crime drama.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed after listening to the man’s account.\n\nBeing an undercover agent is truly difficult.\n\n\"Here, a toast to you.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his wine glass, making a perfunctory gesture towards him.\n\nThen, he put down the glass.\n\n\"So you agree?\" the other party asked.\n\n\"No, I was just stalling to organize my words for refusal, so you and I wouldn't be awkward.\"\n\n\"…………\" The black-clad man.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't do it. This is just a bookstore, actually a relay station, sending departed souls who shouldn't linger in the mortal realm to Hell for reincarnation.\n\nAffairs of the living in the mortal realm are not my business, nor can I interfere. The only thing I can do is write an anonymous letter for you and send it up. Anything more, I cannot, and am unwilling to do.\"\n\nThe black-clad man was somewhat disappointed. He wanted to say more, but it turned into a sigh, and then he drank the wine.\n\nGhosts drinking wine only absorb the alcohol's essence; the liquid in the glass appeared unchanged. Zhou Ze helped him pour out the original wine and refilled the glass.\n\n\"Drink two more glasses, and then I'll send you on your way. Wish you a safe journey.\"\n\nA man’s words are kind when he is about to die.\n\nMoreover, the ghost before him was about to be sent to Hell by him. At this point, there was no need for him to fabricate stories or deceive him.\n\nHe was a good cop, worthy of three glasses.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the wine glass. This was all he could do.\n\nIn this world, turmoil, all sorts of injustices, and tragedies happen every moment. Zhou Ze couldn't manage so much, nor was he willing to.\n\nRunning this bookstore well and getting his second life on the right track was what he was thinking about now.\n\n\"In Hell, there's judgment, right?\"\n\nThe black-clad man asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze paused at his words.\n\nHe suddenly thought of the teacher wearing a tall hat, on which was written 'Beast in Human Clothing'.\n\nZhou Ze had tried to help him take off that hat, but couldn't at all. The hat was like iron, very hard, completely unmovable.\n\nThis also meant that the Yama's Palace** in Hell didn't seem to be the place of clear judgment as rumored, and those judges weren't all equipped with 'fiery eyes and golden pupils'*** to see through everything.\n\nMost of them probably just muddle through, getting by day to day.\n\nPeople always harbor an inexplicable hope for things they don't understand, like Heaven, like Hell. People always believe that in places they haven't been, there will be more beautiful flower scents.\n\nThis is a form of spiritual anesthesia, and also self-hypnosis.\n\nAt least for now, Hell doesn't seem to be much different from the mortal realm.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still nodded,\n\n\"Yes, everything will come to light in Hell.\"\n\nThe black-clad man stood up, looked at Zhou Ze, and said, \"I don't want you to send an anonymous letter for me; just help me find my body. If you consider yourself an underworld messenger****, consider it my plea. If you consider yourself a living person, as a citizen you have an obligation to cooperate with our police actions.\"\n\nThe man stated a place name: Qiming Road, Huangjia Town section.\n\n\"Your bodies haven’t been found yet?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\n\"Yes, not yet. That’s why I haven't been confirmed dead yet. Besides my superior who knows my identity, everyone else thinks I've absconded with this group.\"\n\n\"I'll give it a try.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed his temples. What a bother, truly such a bother.\n\nAs a newly minted homebody, all he wanted was to run a shop, do some business, and then lie on Bai Yingying's lap at night, sleeping and eating grapes she had peeled.\n\nNow he had to go on a long trip, which truly felt annoying.\n\n\"Please send us down. Send us all down together. On the path to the Underworld*****, I want to escort them to see the judges. I want to personally see them brought to justice.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, opened the gate of Hell, and at the same time asked, \"Were they drug tra——?\"\n\nThe black-clad man shook his head.\n\n\"Then smugglers?\"\n\n\"It was gambling,\" the black-clad man said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze was a bit confused. Was such a fuss necessary for gambling arrests?\n\n\"Gambling where human lives are the stakes.\"\n\nThe black-clad man looked at Zhou Ze and didn't continue, because he knew Zhou Ze wasn't very interested in the matter.\n\nHe grabbed the three little devils and walked into the gate of Hell together.\n\nA moment later, the smoke and clouds dispersed. Zhou Ze clapped his hands, took out his notebook to check, and saw the performance chart column had risen to twenty percent.\n\nThere was still eighty percent completion, but judging by the new shop's business, it shouldn't take long to become a full-fledged employee.\n\nPicking up his teacup, he prepared to walk towards his bar counter to continue swaying around as Mr. Zhou, but found that at some point, someone was standing behind him.\n\nIt was Tang Shi. She was still chewing White Rabbit candy.\n\n\"Why didn't you agree to investigate? It sounds so interesting,\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"I'm not that idle,\" Zhou Ze walked back to the counter and sat down.\n\n\"Gambling where human lives are the stakes, it sounds quite interesting,\" Tang Shi continued. \"If he were here, he’d go check it out.\"\n\n\"He is him, I am me.\"\n\n\"Oh, business seems good today. It really seems 'a tree dies if moved, but a person thrives if moved'******,\" Tang Shi walked to the doorway, looking at the two female university students still sheltering from the rain outside.\n\n\"The rain hasn’t stopped yet.\"\n\n\"You're not staying upstairs, you came down just to be melancholic?\" Zhou Ze asked, somewhat surprised.\n\nTang Shi shook her head, then she opened her hand. A paper crane, folded from paper, fluttered gracefully, lifelike.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, do you know? Sometimes, even if you proactively try to avoid trouble, trouble won't necessarily bypass you.\"\n\n\"But at least it can reduce the trouble,\" Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"I haven't had much to do these past two days, so I investigated you.\"\n\nShe said it as if he usually had something to do.\n\nIn Zhou Ze’s eyes, if one disregarded her special abilities and her status as a departed soul, Tang Shi was just a pretty face, incapable of doing anything and unwilling to do anything.\n\nExcept her legs were beautiful, enough to play with for a year.\n\n\"Where are your eyes looking?\"\n\nThe ballpoint pen on Zhou Ze's counter floated up, hovering in front of his eyes, seemingly ready to poke them out at any moment.\n\n\"You look much better in black stockings than nude ones.\"\n\nZhou Ze commented.\n\nTang Shi threw out her phone. It floated in front of Zhou Ze. On the screen was a news screenshot: a riot had occurred at a prison in Subei, resulting in one prisoner dead and over ten injured.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at the screen.\n\n\"How much do you fear trouble?\" Tang Shi shook her head helplessly. \"You don’t even recognize the person who hit you with a truck and killed you?\"\n\nZhou Ze’s pupils immediately constricted.\n\n\"I didn’t do it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I know you didn’t do it,\" Tang Shi said. \"But he’s dead.\"\n\n\"An accident, perhaps? What if they also like to play hide-and-seek?\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked down. He patted his forehead and said to Zhou Ze, \"Old Zhou, sorry about this, I forgot something a few days ago. Your uncle was looking for you those days you were missing. He said his son, your cousin Xu Le, died in a car accident and asked you to attend the funeral.\n\nI figured since you’re Zhou Ze anyway, Xu Le’s relatives have nothing to do with you, and you weren't around then, so I just forgot. Anyway, I just remembered, so I’m telling you now. The funeral was probably half a month ago, it's already over.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Zhou Ze’s expression finally became serious.\n\nMysteriously, it seemed as if a vortex had already quietly begun to stir.\n___\n* **Lei Feng (雷鋒)**: A revered figure in China, known for his selflessness and altruism. \"Learning from Lei Feng and doing good deeds\" is a common slogan encouraging public service and good behavior.\n** **Yama's Palace (閻羅殿)**: The court of Yama, the King of Hell, in Chinese mythology, where the souls of the dead are judged.\n*** **Fiery eyes and golden pupils (火眼金睛)**: An idiom originating from the classic novel *Journey to the West*, describing a supernatural ability to see through disguises and illusions, often associated with the Monkey King, Sun Wukong. It implies keen discernment and insight.\n**** **Underworld messenger (鬼差)**: In Chinese folklore, these are supernatural beings responsible for escorting the souls of the deceased to the underworld.\n***** **Path to the Underworld (黃泉路)**: Also known as Yellow Springs Road, it is the mythological path that souls are believed to take to the afterlife in Chinese folklore.\n****** **A tree dies if moved, but a person thrives if moved (樹挪死人挪活)**: A Chinese idiom meaning that while trees may not survive transplantation, people are more adaptable and can often find success and improvement by changing their circumstances or environments.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze really hated trouble, he truly hated trouble. But this didn't mean that when something genuinely pointed its finger directly at him, he would still foolishly cover his eyes with two leaves and pretend not to see anything.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze's face turn so serious after he finished speaking, Xu Qinglang was also startled for a moment and subconsciously asked:\n\n\"Is something wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then I'll head up first?\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went up, turning back every few steps. Instinctively, he felt something was wrong, but since Zhou Ze chose not to share it with him, he didn't press the issue. Everyone had their own little secrets, and their own calculations.\n\n\"You're serious now?\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze, a half-smile on her face.\n\nZhou Ze also looked at Tang Shi, flicking the ash from his cigarette, and said:\n\n\"Why are you investigating me?\"\n\n\"I told you, it's out of curiosity.\" Tang Shi walked to the bar counter, closing the distance between herself and Zhou Ze. At the same time, her fingertips glided across the counter. \"You know, you're different from us, really different.\"\n\n\"You've said that before, because I haven't truly experienced hell, while all of you have been tormented.\"\n\n\"No, it's not that simple. That person and I, we barely escaped after experiencing the great horror of hell. But you, you just started walking on the Yellow Springs Road, and you were able to escape with your life.\n\nYou know,\none event, one experience,\nis enough to completely change a person.\n\nFor example, whenever that person and I mention the two words 'hell,' our hearts instinctively tremble. Because those two words, 'hell,' and all the images associated with it, are a great horror branded into our hearts.\n\nEven though we have all 'come back to life,' our personalities and ways of acting and dealing with things have been greatly altered because of it.\n\nYou're different. You just went for a picnic in hell and came back.\n\nSo, you can sit at a small table with that police officer, smiling, talking about hell, chatting away pleasantly.\"\n\n\"So, what exactly do you mean? What else have you found?\"\n\nThe truck driver who ran him over and killed him was dead.\n\nXu Le's cousin, who previously helped Xu Le hire someone to kill him, was also dead.\n\nTwo people, dying together within a short period;\n\nAn ordinary person might not connect the deaths of these two, but for Zhou Ze, this matter was very unusual.\n\nXu Le died, his body given to him.\n\nThe driver died.\n\nThe cousin also died.\n\nEveryone who had been involved in the incident before was dead.\n\nCould there really be such a coincidence?\n\n\"We are anomalies of this world. We are even different from ghost messengers. We are stowaways, and you, you are an anomaly among anomalies.\n\nWe are not the same.\"\n\n\"Get to the point.\" Zhou Ze tapped the blackboard (bar counter).\n\n\"Have you ever suspected that your death and your rebirth were not an accident?\"\n\nTang Shi lowered her voice and asked slowly,\n\n\"Think carefully. Is there anything you might have overlooked?\"\n\n............\n\n\"They're coming for me, they've found me......\"\n\nThe old man's nails pierced his own arm, and the old man's final relieved smile.\n\nAt the traffic light, his car had just pulled out.\n\nA large truck ran a red light and drove out,\n\nheading straight for him.\n\nThe blaze of the crematorium and that scorching heat;\n\nThe numbness and desolation on the Yellow Springs Road in hell.\n\nThe faceless woman's roar and resentment,\n\nThe black fingernails growing from his fingertips.\n\nHimself, swaying dizzily by the roadside.\n\nA man in a hoodie ran out of the bookstore.\n\nHe bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\n\nand then he entered Xu Le's body.\n\n............\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head, opening his eyes.\n\nThe person who killed Xu Le,\n\nafter he called the police that time, what exactly became of him?\n\nZhou Ze had always overlooked this matter.\n\nHe had been going in circles around the bookstore and matters concerning Dr. Lin. Regarding Xu Le's death and his own \"magpie occupying the dove's nest,\"^1 he mostly understood it as a form of karmic retribution.\n\nIt was also, in another sense, heaven's justice.\n\nBut since the old man, who was sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, intentionally plunged his nails into his own arm,\n\nthe truck driver who ran a red light and killed him was intentional,\n\nso many people, all of them intentional,\n\nthen,\n\nthe man who he had previously explained away as acting on a momentary impulse to steal some money when he bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\n\nwas he,\n\nalso intentional?\n\nIf he was intentional,\n\nthen it meant that the entire chain of events, from his death to his rebirth,\n\nwas thought to be designed. He was like a toy race car on a track, appearing to speed along furiously, but in reality, only following a predetermined path.\n\n\"It seems you've thought of something.\"\n\nTang Shi put another White Rabbit milk candy into her mouth.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the phone. He was going to call the police station. The last time he reported a case, he also went to the police station to make a statement. His first meeting with Dr. Lin back then was also at the police station.\n\nThat female police officer led Dr. Lin to him and said, \"Your wife is here to take you home.\"\n\nZhou Ze was dazed for quite a while.\n\nHowever, before dialing the number, Zhou Ze looked at Tang Shi and asked:\n\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"You know, compared to us,\n\nyou're like an adorable husky\n\nthat snuck into a wolf den.\"\n\n..................\n\nThe rain was still falling, showing no sign of stopping. Tongcheng was located in the Yangtze River Delta region, and it was naturally abundant in rainfall during this season.\n\nThere were no earthquakes here, nor tsunamis. The only thing that happened fairly often and could cause some impact was urban flooding.\n\nWearing a raincoat, Zhou Ze walked beneath the old apartment building. The trash cans were already soaked with rainwater, and some garbage had floated out.\n\nTang Shi wore rain boots and a black raincoat. Her legs were faintly visible through the rainwater. However, Zhou Ze naturally had no leisure to admire such a scene right now.\n\nHe had called earlier to check the situation: the person he sent to the police station had only been detained for half a month, charged merely with violating public order regulations. After all, although he had \"committed an assault\" at Zhou Ze's shop, he was ultimately knocked down by Zhou Ze, making it difficult to press any major charges.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze certainly couldn't say:\n\n\"Officer,\n\nhe's a murderer.\n\nHe killed me.\n\nAnd I am not me.\n\nI am a soul possessing another's body!^2\"\n\nIf he said that,\n\nit was estimated that by then, the other person wouldn't be locked up,\n\nbut he himself would be forcibly sent to a mental hospital.\n\nNevertheless, Zhou Ze still managed to find that person's address from there; it was in this area.\n\n\"This is the one.\"\n\nGoing up to the second floor, Zhou Ze stopped in front of a door.\n\nMost of the apartments in this community were rented to migrant workers coming to Tongcheng for work. The environmental facilities were actually very poor, and they even used communal bathrooms.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"The door number should be correct.\"\n\nZhou Ze tried to look through the window. There was a screen obstructing the view inside, and worn-out curtains, so it was unclear what was inside from the outside.\n\n\"I'll go find something to pry open the door first......\"\n\n\"Click......\"\n\nThe door lock opened automatically.\n\nTang Shi made a 'please enter' gesture towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment,\n\nthen smiled,\n\nand walked in.\n\nHe thought to himself that it was a real shame not to be a thief with her.\n\nThe room was actually just a studio apartment.\n\nOne room,\n\nwith a bed and wardrobe, plus a small cooking area with an induction cooker.\n\nThe room was relatively neat, but some areas had accumulated dust, clearly indicating it hadn't been lived in for a long time.\n\n\"How long has he been out?\"\n\n\"Several months. I sent him to the police station the day after I was reborn, and he was released half a month later.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around, examining the details.\n\n\"Did he move?\" Tang Shi said.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Not sure.\"\n\nThe guy who bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\n\nwas he missing?\n\nZhou Ze suddenly noticed an area on the wall behind the bed that looked different. He stepped onto the bed, reached out, and felt that section of the wall, then said:\n\n\"This wall looks like it was re-plastered.\"\n\n\"Is something hidden inside?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\nZhou Ze pressed his ear against the wall and tapped it with his hand. \"It doesn't sound hollow.\"\n\nActually, in houses of this type, hollow spots in walls are very common. Usually, when new apartment renovations are underway, the renovation team will first send a master craftsman to tap on the walls and floors with a ruler, and if problems are found, they'll ask the developer for rectification before proceeding with the renovation work.\n\n\"Just open it up and see.\" Tang Shi said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, just about to say he would find a tool, then glanced at Tang Shi and instinctively stepped back a few paces.\n\nTang Shi's gaze fell upon the kitchen knife and other hard objects next to the induction cooker. Then these objects flew out, continuously striking and chiseling at the wall, again and again.\n\nThe thought of starting a construction company resurfaced in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nBai Yingying alone could match the labor of an entire construction crew.\n\nTang Shi could replace a batch of engineering equipment.\n\nHe would just need to sit there and count money.\n\nHowever, as the wall continuously cracked, Zhou Ze immediately discarded those random thoughts from his mind.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA section of the wall broke off and fell.\n\nA human face was revealed.\n\nThis face still held a horrifying expression, seemingly perfectly preserving the emotional state from before death.\n\nIt was that person,\n\nthe one who had bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat!\n\nIn the air,\n\na sour smell permeated.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, examined the corpse inside, frowned, and said:\n\n\"The body looks like it died less than a week ago.\"\n\n\"You're not a forensic pathologist, are you?\" Tang Shi reminded him.\n\n\"It's common knowledge for a surgeon. You can roughly determine the time of death based on the state of the corpse,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Then I can tell you, the wall I just broke into was definitely not sealed up less than a week ago; it's been at least three months.\"\n\nTang Shi unwrapped a milk candy, put it into her mouth, and continued:\n\n\"Unless you think he was killed a week ago and then moved into a wall that was sealed three months ago.\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately realized something was wrong.\n\nIt was obvious that the corpse couldn't have been \"teleported\" into the wall afterward, and the wall was perfectly intact before Tang Shi broke into it.\n\nHe sniffed.\n\nThat sour smell,\n\nwhich he had previously thought was just from the corpse,\n\nat this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly realized something. He pushed aside the hair on the corpse's head,\n\nand indeed,\n\nfound a small hole; it was an injection site.\n\n\"Yes, the body has been dead for a long time, but he was injected with formaldehyde, which is why the corpse is so well-preserved.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nformaldehyde must have been slowly injected into him while he was still alive,\n\nbecause it would be more effective if it spread throughout the body via blood circulation.\"\n***\n^1. **Magpie occupying the dove's nest (鵲巢鳩占)**: An idiom meaning to usurp someone's home, position, or property, often through cunning or force.\n^2. **I am a soul possessing another's body!

    "content": "屋外，周澤抽著煙，唐詩站在旁邊，咀嚼著奶糖。\n\n屋內，牆壁上的屍首頹然地垂落著，臉上恐怖驚悚的表情清晰無比，像是殺人藏屍案才剛剛發生。\n\n都死了，\n一個都沒留。\n\n徐樂死了，\n殺死徐樂的人死了，\n肇事司機死了，\n堂弟死了，\n一條線上的所有點，都死了。\n\n就連周澤，其實也是死了。\n\n正如唐詩所說的那樣，有時候不是你自己刻意地去避免麻煩，麻煩就真的也不會再來找你。\n\n一個口袋，在很久之前就已經張開，無論你願不願意，樂不樂意，其實你都在這個口袋裡。\n\n「都死了，線索也就斷了吧。」\n唐詩看著周澤，嘴角含笑，她似乎很喜歡看周澤這種情緒和狀態。\n\n狼群里一群狼各個苦大仇深整天陰沉著臉，結果一隻哈士奇出現，只想著躺在那裡萌萌噠，\n真的是一件讓人很不爽的事情。\n\n憑什麼我們一個個心思沉重，\n只有你一個人天真爛漫？\n不患寡而患不均，這一點不僅僅體現在金錢分配的方面。\n\n「目前來看，確實是這樣。」\n周澤伸手揉了揉自己的眉心，\n「而且，我還得擔心一件事，那就是警方會不會最後調查到我的頭上。」\n\n主謀，花錢的，是徐樂。\n司機死了，中間聯繫人堂弟也死了，\n之前周澤忍著不去報仇的原因也是這個，他不想暴露自己，因為這會毀掉自己現在的生活。\n\n現代社會和古代有太多的不同，哪怕古代也有戶籍制度，但一個沒身份的人真想藏下去隱居下去，其實不難。\n而現代社會，一個人的身份信息標籤卻很重要，當然，周澤想藏的話也可以藏，但為此付出的代價是自己生活質量的快速滑坡，整天東躲西藏。\n\n眼下，人不是周澤殺的，但周澤自然而然地就得承擔他們被殺之後所可能引起的風波。\n復仇的爽感沒享受到，\n還得背鍋，\n好氣哦！\n\n拿出手機，周澤撥通了派出所的電話。\n「喂，我要報警。」\n\n唐詩沒陪著周澤去警局，而是先回了書店，在雨天穿著雨衣踩著泥濘的道路陪周澤查看了兇殺現場已經是她能做到的極致了，她不可能再去陪著周澤去面對警局裡複雜的筆錄和詢問調查。\n\n至於周澤，他沒辦法，他必須得這麼做，畢竟，是他剛剛打電話給派出所詢問了死者的住處，若是現在不報警，等之後屍體被發現了自己的嫌疑只會更加地大。\n而將屍體秘密處理掉，周澤不願意這麼做，在沒分得清楚到底是誰在幕後操控這一切時，周澤不想去自作聰明幫別人收尾。\n可能，一不小心，自己就挖個坑，把自己給埋了。\n\n…………\n\n調查和問話，一直持續到了晚上八點多，換了幾波警察，可以很清楚地看出來，他們是把周澤當作了兇手去對待的。\n不要以為兇手就不會主動報警，\n事實上，\n根據警方大數據的統計，有八成以上的殺人案件中的兇手會偽裝成「吃瓜群眾」重回案發現場看看。\n\n大部分兇手的心態是想去偽裝自己和查看一下訊息，少部分則是本著我殺了人就得去欣賞一下我的藝術品的變態思維。\n如果死者遲遲沒有被發現，對於兇手來說無疑是明珠暗投，蒙娜麗莎的微笑被一層黑布蓋上了，撓人心痒痒，所以乾脆自己報警好讓這層蓋頭被掀開。\n\n到最後，是一個頭髮半白的老刑警坐在周澤面前，合上了記錄本，對周澤道：\n「周先生，你可以離開了，但請你這一個月暫時不要離開通城，我們可能還會找你了解一些情況。」\n「好。」\n\n周澤起身，離開了審訊室，走到了警局門口。\n回過頭，看了看身後進進出出的警察以及停在裡面的一排警車，莫名地，感受到了一股壓力。\n或許，用不了多久，那起製造出來的車禍真相也會浮出水面，到時候自己所面對的，可能是真正的風浪。\n\n苦主其實是自己，但真兇，\n也是自己。\n\n周澤準備回書店，他有些累了，想先休息，手機卻在此時響起了，小姨子的電話。\n「喂，徐樂，你那個大伯又來了，坐在樓道口，我喊他進來坐他也不願意，就說要等你回來。」\n\n大伯？\n「就說我不會回來了，也別告訴他我新店的地址。」周澤這時候不想去搭理無關的人。\n\n「哐當！」\n電話那頭傳來了砸門的聲音，\n周澤眉頭微皺，問道：「怎麼了？」\n「額，你大伯在砸門，他說，如果你今天不回來，就要你去坐牢。」\n\n聞言，\n周澤抬起頭，咬了咬牙，道：「告訴他，我馬上回來。」\n\n…………\n\n沒人願意像是受氣包一樣活著，沒人願意讓自己的生活受到掣肘，大家都想隨性，但人生就是如此。\n當你幾個月大的時候，你能到處噓噓，可以隨意尿床，你的長輩和親戚們還會笑臉相迎，彈一彈你的小丁丁。\n但當你十多歲，二十多歲之後，想再隨意地噓噓，想再被彈丁丁，就不可能了。\n你很難想像一個四十五歲的長輩彈著一個二十幾歲年輕人丁丁的畫面：\n你又尿了，好皮哦。\n這個畫面，太辣眼睛。\n\n也因此，當周澤出現在徐大川面前時，\n徐大川一臉陰沉，\n周澤也是一臉陰鬱。\n大家都不開心，\n大家都不快樂，\n但大家還得碰面。\n\n徐大川沒去傷害屋子裡的人，周澤來的時候，他蹲在那裡抽著旱菸，看見周澤過來，他站起身，拍拍褲管，\n「陪我出去走走。」\n這一次，徐大川沒帶土特產，空手而來。\n\n周澤和徐大川一起走了出去，他也沒去和門縫裡的小姨子和林醫生打什麼招呼。\n二人走到了小區外面，\n天已經完全黑了，\n路燈下，人也不是很多。\n\n徐大川走了一段路，又蹲了下來，「砸吧砸吧」地抽旱菸。\n周澤在他旁邊站定。\n\n「小船子已經燒了。」徐大川說道。\n小船子應該是堂弟的小名。\n\n「嗯。」周澤應了一聲，「我當時不在通城。」\n「沒事。」\n\n徐大川敲了敲旱菸杆，抬起頭，他的臉上滿是滄桑和溝壑，這是一個老實巴交的老男人，辛勤持家，徐樂這個大學生，其實也是他供出來的。\n「阿樂啊，小船子出殯那天，你沒來，真的有些不地道啊。」\n\n徐大川眼角濕潤，蹲在那裡，用乾裂的手背擦著自己眼角的淚水。\n「我說了，我當時不在通城。」\n\n徐大川忽然站起身，一隻手攥著周澤的衣領，把周澤往外一推，將其靠在了電線桿上。\n「阿樂，跟大伯說實話，小船子，是不是你做掉的！」\n\n周澤眼睛微微一眯，徐大川剛剛問的話裡頭，信息量很多。\n之前，周澤是對徐大川有些好感的；\n\n是是非非對對錯錯，和他沒什麼關係，而且，徐大川算是自己重生以來，第一個真正關心過自己的陌生人。\n他能忍受林家的白眼帶著土特產來看自己，\n哪怕在病床上依舊會對著林醫生這個侄媳婦兒笑眯眯滿意得不行，\n還說如果上門女婿當不下去，大不了回去跟他一起種地。\n在周澤看來，他本該淳樸，本該善良，本該作為一片淨土。\n而現在，似乎這片淨土，並沒有想像中那般純淨。\n\n「不是我。」\n周澤伸手，攥住了徐大川的手腕。\n\n「小船子和你的事兒，別以為我不清楚，我也知道小船子這陣子經常到你這裡來跟你要錢，他不懂事兒，他不爭氣，他有千錯萬錯。\n但他畢竟是你弟弟！」\n\n徐大川眼睛開始出現血絲，整個人，有點發瘋的趨勢。\n「我不知道你在說什麼。」\n\n周澤忽然很厭惡眼前的這個男人，\n這個老實巴交的漢子。\n\n「不知道我在說什麼？」\n徐大川把臉湊到周澤面前，一字一字地道：\n「那個司機，是不是死了，他是我隔壁村的，你以為小船子能認識什麼人，能懂得什麼人嘴巴瓷實？\n他才幾根毛，有什麼資格去跟別人談？\n那個司機，是我去找的，去談的。\n大伯想讓你過上好日子，你婆姨喜歡上了別人，你日子過得憋屈，大伯就幫你一起把那個小三給弄死！\n大伯想讓咱家所有孩子，都過得舒舒坦坦的，不被人欺負，不被人瞧不起。\n但，\n阿樂啊，\n你不能殺小船子滅口啊，\n你爹死得早，是大伯供你讀書的，大伯一直拿你當自己的孩子！\n你掏心窩子地跟大伯說一句實話，\n小船子，到底是不是你像上次那樣叫人把他故意撞死的，\n你是不是想滅口？」\n\n周澤深吸一口氣，\n徐大川問錯了對象，\n事實上，\n他每一句問話，都相當於是在火上澆油。\n要知道，在他面前的，\n不是他的侄子徐樂，\n而是那位在那起事件中，真正的受害者苦主！\n\n「砰！」\n周澤一腳踹出去，將徐大川踹翻在了地上。\n\n此時此刻，周澤有種忍不住想要自爆的感覺；\n他後悔了，非常地後悔，早知道是現在這個局面，當初剛重生的自己就該主動向警方自首。\n徐樂的堂弟，\n徐大川，\n那個司機，\n都一起接受來自法律的制裁吧，哪怕他以徐樂的身份一同受到牽連，無所謂。\n就拿這賺來的第二輩子，給自己的第一輩子復仇，似乎也是快意恩仇。\n至少，\n比眼下的進退維谷，要好得太多太多。\n\n只是現在，\n堂弟和司機都死了，那個殺徐樂的人也死了，他們死得乾脆，也讓周澤的復仇無從談起。\n你有勁，你有力氣，但一拳打在棉花上，總是憋屈。\n\n被踹翻倒地的徐大川馬上爬了起來，對著周澤大吼大叫道：\n「阿樂，是你翻臉不認人的，\n我要去公安局舉報，\n你是個殺人兇手，\n殺人兇手！\n我要你給小船子陪葬，陪葬！！！」\n\n周澤看著徐大川，\n看著這個哪怕現在看起來依舊是飽經風霜一臉憨厚的老男人，\n負於身後的左手，\n慢慢地長出了黑色的指甲，\n周澤嘴角勾了勾，\n似乎是在品味著這個詞：\n「陪葬？」\n\n***\n**Translator's Notes:**\n*   **不患寡而患不均 (bù huàn guǎ ér huàn bù jūn)**: A Chinese proverb attributed to Confucius, meaning \"do not worry about scarcity, but about unfair distribution.\" It emphasizes that social stability is more threatened by inequality than by poverty itself.\n*   **吃瓜群眾 (chī guā qún zhòng)**: Literally \"melon-eating masses,\" this term refers to curious bystanders who observe an event unfold, often online, without getting directly involved.\n*   **明珠暗投 (míng zhū àn tóu)**: Literally \"a bright pearl cast into darkness,\" this idiom generally means a valuable thing given to someone who doesn't appreciate it, or talent unrecognized.

    "content": "Xu Dachuan was yelling and screaming, utterly deranged. This man, in the days following his son's death, was enduring immense psychological pressure and torment.\n\nHe felt immensely wronged.\n\nHe felt immense pain.\n\nHe felt his life had been difficult, very challenging.\n\nIf it had been someone else standing there instead of Zhou Ze, perhaps they might have felt some sympathy and pity for him.\n\nBut unfortunately,\n\nstanding before him was Zhou Ze.\n\nAnyone might have sympathized with him,\n\nbut not Zhou Ze.\n\nHe was dead,\n\nand this coarse man, weeping, deranged, and hysterical before him,\n\nwas also one of the accomplices in his own murder.\n\nWhy do all of you feel sorry for yourselves?\n\nWhy do all of you feel wronged?\n\nWhat about me then?\n\nWho will pity me?\n\nWho will spare a thought for me?\n\nZhou Ze naturally walked up to Xu Dachuan. He lifted his chin. At that moment, countless emotions were wildly driving him to kill the man before him.\n\nTo tear him to shreds,\n\nnot just his body,\n\nbut his soul too!\n\nOnly by making him endure the greatest pain and torment could his inner rage be quelled!\n\nLife, it seemed, always had many coincidences. A police car drove up from a distance.\n\nZhou Ze watched the flashing lights on top of the police car. At this moment, he felt no fear, no dread, even a sense of reckless abandon.\n\nIf all of this truly was just a trap.\n\nThen,\n\nI might as well go crazy with it.\n\nRather than suffering wrong and pain alone,\n\nwhy not let everyone\n\nhurt each other!\n\nXu Dachuan was still shouting and gesticulating. The police car pulled up beside them, and two officers got out. They might have been on patrol or just passing by coincidentally, but they still got out to understand the situation.\n\nThe officers walked over. Xu Dachuan suddenly quieted down. He looked at Zhou Ze with venomous eyes, then glanced at the police.\n\nHe began to actively walk towards the police.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze's hands, clasped behind his back, had grown full nails, and swirls of black energy continuously encircled his ten fingers.\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\nIn the depths of his pupils,\n\nit seemed a black torrent was flowing.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze seemed to gradually rediscover the feeling he had on the rooftop that day, as if he had been completely abandoned by society, by life itself.\n\nThat solitude, that helplessness,\n\nconstantly released the pent-up suppression deep within him.\n\nI am a ghost messenger.\n\nI've died once.\n\nI cultivate myself,\n\nbut I don't like to swallow insults.\n\nIf what was coming was a storm,\n\nthen I would indulge myself one more time\n\namidst the downpour.\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had always been fearful, afraid of becoming an example like that person in Rongcheng, an example of someone suppressed.\n\nBut sometimes, it was truly difficult to control oneself.\n\nOf course, what was even harder to control was the vortex around you; it would actively push you, entice you, force you,\n\nstep by step,\n\ntowards the abyss.\n\n\"What's going on?\" one officer asked Xu Dachuan, while the other, a middle-aged officer, looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nInstinctively, the middle-aged officer sensed a hint of danger from Zhou Ze; this was his sixth sense, honed by years of police experience.\n\nAlthough the young man before him was somewhat gaunt, appeared a bit frail, and had his eyes closed, the middle-aged officer's lips felt dry.\n\nIt was a bit embarrassing to admit, but at that moment, he actually felt a little nervous.\n\n\"Heh, what the hell, why am I nervous?\"\n\n\"Nothing, I just had a bit to drink, teaching a younger generation a lesson. He's being disobedient, wants to divorce his wife, so I have to discipline him!\"\n\nXu Dachuan said, his eyes bloodshot.\n\nThe two officers exchanged a glance. Since it was a family matter, they decided not to intervene. They immediately got back into their car, and the police vehicle drove off.\n\nThe middle-aged officer turned his head again to look behind them.\n\n\"Cui Ge, what are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThe middle-aged officer straightened up, shaking his head.\n\nOn the roadside,\n\nXu Dachuan turned his head and looked at Zhou Ze again.\n\n\"Hrr... Pthui!\"\n\nA thick wad of phlegm was spat heavily onto the ground by him.\n\nXu Dachuan, who had just been making a fuss about reporting Zhou Ze to the police, did not report him. As a father who had already lost his son, it wasn't that he was afraid of getting involved himself, but rather, at that crucial moment, he had a change of heart.\n\n\"You'd better find someone to kill me too, then no one will ever know what you did before!\"\n\nXu Dachuan growled lowly. His son was dead, and he didn't want to send this nephew, Xu Le, to the execution ground too, otherwise, his family line would be cut off.\n\nHis thoughts were simple,\n\ntruly very, very simple.\n\nIf his nephew's wife had someone else she liked outside,\n\nthen help kill that fellow!\n\nNow that his own son was dead, he couldn't let his old Xu family line die out.\n\nVery noble?\n\nYes,\n\nvery noble.\n\nBut in Zhou Ze's eyes,\n\nit was utterly disgusting.\n\nXu Dachuan bent down to pick up his tobacco pipe. He was ready to leave, ready to go home. He had thought about it for a long time, and been angry for a long time, but at this moment, he still didn't have the courage to truly drag Xu Le to be buried with his son.\n\nHowever, Xu Dachuan's tobacco pipe was stomped under Zhou Ze's foot.\n\nXu Dachuan looked up, somewhat dazed.\n\nZhou Ze slowly bent down and picked up the tobacco pipe.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nThe pipe landed heavily on Xu Dachuan's body.\n\nXu Dachuan let out a muffled groan, looking at Zhou Ze with disbelief.\n\n\"You dare...!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nAnother vicious strike, and Xu Dachuan was knocked to the ground. His leg had been operated on recently and hadn't fully recovered, so at this moment, facing Zhou Ze's sudden outburst, he could only curl up on the ground.\n\nThe police had already driven away, naturally unaware of the scene unfolding.\n\n\"I'll teach you noble!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nAnother strike.\n\n\"I'll teach you soft-hearted!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nAnother strike.\n\n\"I'll teach you to feel wronged!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\n\"I'll teach you to feel life is hard!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\n\"I'll teach you to feel days are tough!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\n\"I'll teach you to feel pitiful!\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze, who had suppressed his emotions for a long time, thrashed Xu Dachuan repeatedly like a madman, causing Xu Dachuan to tremble uncontrollably on the ground.\n\nFinally,\n\nhe dropped the pipe,\n\nstumbled back a few steps,\n\nand leaned against a utility pole.\n\n\"Cough, cough... cough, cough...\"\n\nHeavy coughing sounds came from his mouth.\n\nHe looked up,\n\ngazing at the dim night sky.\n\nSome of the rage in his heart had been vented,\n\nbut deep down, he didn't feel much relief.\n\nThese people—\n\nthey were loving fathers and filial sons,\n\nharmonious brothers;\n\nthey helped each other, cared for each other.\n\nBut the more they were like this, the more disgusted Zhou Ze felt.\n\nTurning around, leaving Xu Dachuan bruised and swollen, curled up there, Zhou Ze slowly walked forward alone.\n\nHe lit a cigarette, took a deep drag,\n\nthen pinched out the flame with his fingernail, crumbled the remaining tobacco, put it in his mouth, and slowly chewed it.\n\nHe took out his phone, ready to call a taxi, but there were no cars nearby.\n\nLeft with no choice,\n\nZhou Ze dialed Xu Qinglang's number:\n\n\"Hey, Old Zhou, what are you doing? Not opening for business today, huh?\"\n\n\"Come pick me up.\"\n\nZhou Ze gave the address.\n\n\"Hold on, I'll call Old Dao. He just took my car out to buy candy for that woman; I'll have him pick you up on his way back.\"\n\nHe hung up the phone.\n\nZhou Ze spat out the tobacco residue from his mouth and leaned against the utility pole, lost in thought for a long time.\n\nXu Dachuan, he hadn't killed him.\n\nUnderneath this trap,\n\nno one was truly innocent,\n\nyet everyone seemed like a puppet on strings, doing what they were supposed to at predetermined junctures,\n\nuntil finally,\n\nthey were used and discarded.\n\nSomeone was orchestrating all of this, like a catalyst, accelerating its operation.\n\nThat person\n\nwas the true instigator, the culprit who caused his death in a car accident in his previous life.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, a black Nissan pulled up beside Zhou Ze. The window rolled down, revealing Old Dao.\n\n\"Boss, found you.\"\n\nOld Dao diligently got out first and opened the car door for Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze got in. Old Dao then diligently took out a piece of milk candy from a large package and offered it to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Boss, have some.\"\n\nZhou Ze pushed Old Dao's hand away, indicating he wasn't in the mood.\n\nOld Dao chuckled awkwardly, unfazed.\n\nAfter all, compared to Zhou Ze, his previous boss at the underworld store had been much harder to get along with. Zhou Ze was actually much more peaceful and amiable than the last one. Of course, it wasn't that the previous one had a bad temper, but as soon as he sat behind the counter, Old Dao would instinctively not dare to speak too loudly.\n\n\"If you don't want candy, have a cigarette.\"\n\nOld Dao offered Zhou Ze a cigarette, lit it for him, and then got back into the driver's seat.\n\nThe car started, and Old Dao made a turn, heading back.\n\nAt the next intersection, Old Dao turned right. As they passed the entrance of a residential complex, he instinctively slowed down and peered inside.\n\nThis was the complex where the Lin family lived.\n\nEarlier, Zhou Ze had come here, picked up Xu Dachuan, and the two had walked a distance, but they couldn't have gone too far.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, this is it! Didn't you know?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Miss Tang told you before, didn't she? When she was injured, she could only hide in a *dengxiahei* place, and there were only two such spots in Tongcheng.\n\nOne was your bookstore,\n\nand the other was this residential complex.\n\nBut Miss Tang said there seemed to be a problem with the lights here, so in the end, we chose to hide near your place to evade pursuit.\"\n\nOld Dao continued talking to himself,\n\nnot noticing\n\nthat Zhou Ze's hand, holding the cigarette,\n\nwas trembling slightly...\n___\n**Footnote:**\n\n*   *Dengxiahei* (灯下黑): A Chinese idiom meaning \"darkness under the lamp,\" referring to a blind spot or a place that is easily overlooked because it's too close or obvious.",

    "content": "「Old Daoist.」\n\n「Hey, boss, what's up?」\n\n「Stop the car.」\n\n「Oh, okay.」\n\nGetting out of the car, Zhou Ze threw the cigarette butt on the ground and stepped on it with his sole.\n\n「You go back first.」\n\n「Huh?」 The old Daoist paused, 「Boss, I can wait for you to come out.」\n\n「Go back.」\n\n「It's fine, boss, I don't mind waiting...」\n\n「Go back.」\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked at the old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist shivered with fright.\n\nTsk tsk tsk,\n\nSure enough, these guys who crawled out of hell are essentially the same. This one, who seemed quite approachable before, was all a disguise.\n\nA disguise!\n\nThe old Daoist immediately saluted, 「Alright, boss, call me when you need the car.」\n\nThe old Daoist drove off.\n\nZhou Ze lingered at the entrance of the residential complex for about fifteen minutes.\n\nTang Shi had told him before that after the little loli left Tong City, besides his bookstore, there was another place that was a 'light under the lamp'*.\n\nHowever, there might have been a problem with this 'lamp', which was why Tang Shi didn't choose to hide here, but instead went to his bookstore.\n\nTang Shi hinted that he could go there to check it out, perhaps find some unexpected discoveries and gains, strike while he's down**, or at least take some advantage.\n\nZhou Ze was afraid of trouble at the time, so he didn't go, nor did he ask for details.\n\nAnd so, it wasn't until just now, from the old Daoist's mouth, that Zhou Ze learned this 'light under the lamp' place was actually the residential complex where Doctor Lin lived.\n\nPoint by point, a circle was drawn.\n\nEven if those points were gone, the circle was ultimately formed.\n\nHis changing perceptions of Doctor Lin before and after,\n\nDoctor Lin keeping his house from his previous life, buying it, and carefully maintaining it,\n\nXu Le's identity,\n\nSleeping in separate beds,\n\nThe real murder disguised as an accidental car accident,\n\nKilling people one by one to silence them and destroy evidence.\n\nIn fact, many, many details had long pointed in this direction.\n\nIncluding that day when he, disguised as a doctor, finished the surgery at the hospital and confessed to Doctor Lin,\n\nDoctor Lin actively embraced him.\n\nAt the time, he had only thought it was all beautiful, perhaps not noticing that the corners of the face in his embrace might have already shown a slight curve.\n\nOne hand,\n\nIt stirred the pond water, causing the swimming fish to churn, until finally, the fishing net fell, and the catch was brought in.\n\nPeople cast nets to catch fish, and they catch fish to eat them;\n\nHouses are decorated for beauty, and beauty is for comfort.\n\nEverything, in the end, has a purpose. Even sitting there motionlessly, simply staring blankly, is for the enjoyment of that relaxed state of self-emptiness.\n\nHis previous death, and his subsequent soul possessing another body,\n\nHis new identity, new family relationships,\n\nIn the end,\n\nWho benefited the most?\n\nThat woman who had always secretly loved him, who had a husband he didn't like; she adhered to the constraints of etiquette and the rules of the family.\n\nShe didn't violate them, nor did she break them, but within the rules, she successfully made the husband she originally disliked become a different person.\n\nSomeone an outsider would completely ignore, be completely unaware of, completely unable to discover.\n\nShe lay contentedly beside the bed, continuing to be the dignified young lady***, living the life her parents envisioned for her, yet still doing things for her own desires and pursuits.\n\nMany thoughts, chaotic and troubling,\n\nKept swirling chaotically in Zhou Ze's mind, making him unable to distinguish direction; at this moment, his heart was so chaotic he couldn't grasp himself.\n\nIf all of this, truly, was as he suspected, and it was really her who manipulated the trajectory of the entire incident, then what attitude should he adopt to face her?\n\nShould it be anger, resentment, for her killing him and destroying his original life?\n\nShould it be emotional, helpless, after all, the more she did, the more it actually proved her feelings for him?\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze could, without psychological pressure, take his pipe and fiercely beat Xu Dachuan. But now, Zhou Ze didn't have the heart to pick up a branch from the ground and rush into the Lin family's house.\n\nHumans are such complex creatures; they are not robots, who simply follow the drive of a program, naturally making choices based on a series of trigger code settings.\n\nFifteen minutes of hesitation, fifteen minutes of indecision,\n\nUltimately,\n\nZhou Ze still took a step and walked into the residential complex.\n\nSome matters needed to be clarified, some words had to be spoken openly.\n\nThis was for himself,\n\nAn explanation to himself,\n\nAn explanation to his previous life.\n\nIgnorance is bliss****,\n\nDid not apply here.\n\n「Knock knock knock...」\n\nHe knocked on the door.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had a key to the house, but it wasn't on him; he hadn't returned to the Lin family's house in a long time.\n\n「Coming!」\n\nHis sister-in-law's voice came from inside. She opened the door, saw it was Zhou Ze, and asked:\n\n「Xu Le, your elder uncle left?」\n\n「Mm, he left.」\n\nI beat him away.\n\n「Oh.」 His sister-in-law hadn't fully opened the door yet.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze wasn't leaving, she said, somewhat surprised:\n\n「Do you want to come in?」\n\nZhou Ze didn't move.\n\nHis sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. Zhou Ze hadn't been home for a long time; his sudden return caught her off guard, but Zhou Ze was still her brother-in-law after all, so she opened the door.\n\nZhou Ze walked in and sat on the sofa in the living room.\n\nHis sister-in-law brought Zhou Ze a bottle of orange juice and an ashtray. Lately, her relationship with Zhou Ze had been good, because Zhou Ze often covered for her to go out and play, so her attitude towards Zhou Ze at home had changed significantly compared to the beginning.\n\n「Where’s your sister?」\n\n「She just went out to buy groceries. My parents were discharged from the hospital yesterday, and an old friend from out of province had a child getting married, so they went to show their support. By the way, your elder uncle just sitting outside our door really scared me.\n\nEspecially since he also said he wanted to send you to prison. Tsk tsk, Xu Le, why are your relatives on your side so strange?」\n\nHis sister-in-law sat on the opposite sofa, turned on the TV, and propped her feet on the coffee table, simply having no proper way of sitting or standing.\n\nCompared to Doctor Lin's generous and proper demeanor, they truly didn't seem like sisters.\n\nTruly,\n\nThey didn't.\n\n「Hey, Xu Le, you still haven't answered me. Does your elder uncle have something on you? Did he come to ask you for money?」\n\nXu Le was the Lin family's live-in son-in-law. The Lin family naturally didn't have a good impression of Xu Le's relatives who liked to sponge off others*****, after all, Xu Le's money before was actually given by the Lin family.\n\n「It's nothing.」\n\nZhou Ze lit another cigarette, preparing to wait for Doctor Lin to return.\n\n「Really nothing?」 His sister-in-law looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n「You're annoying.」\n\nHearing this, his sister-in-law puffed out her cheeks and let out a disgruntled hmph.\n\nShe felt Xu Le was becoming more and more presumptuous, but considering she'd still need him to cover for her to go out and play in the future, she wouldn't bother arguing with him.\n\nA cigarette rested on the ashtray; Zhou Ze watched it slowly burn down.\n\nThe cigarette smoke curled, gathering and dispersing.\n\nJust then,\n\nThe sound of the door opening came from the entrance; Zhou Ze subconsciously stood up.\n\nDoctor Lin returned, carrying some groceries. She had her hair in a braid and was on vacation today, so she looked very refreshed.\n\nShe was somewhat surprised to see Zhou Ze at home.\n\n「Sis, you're cooking today, huh?」 His sister-in-law, holding a cushion and watching TV, playfully pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n「Have you eaten?」 Doctor Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, 「No.」\n\n「Then wait a moment, I'll go make dinner.」 Doctor Lin seemed to be deliberately maintaining a calm relationship, then she walked into the kitchen.\n\nZhou Ze stood rooted to the spot, feeling a dilemma for a moment.\n\nHis heart was very chaotic now.\n\n「Hey, why are you just standing there blankly? Go help!」\n\nHis sister-in-law lightly kicked Zhou Ze's leg with her foot.\n\nNot cherishing such a good opportunity to strengthen their relationship, just standing there dumbfounded—truly low emotional intelligence.\n\nHis sister-in-law felt that this brother-in-law of hers was truly far worse than the boys who pursued her at school; he was practically a blockhead.\n\nZhou Ze finally walked into the kitchen.\n\nIn the kitchen, Doctor Lin had already tied on an apron and was cutting vegetables.\n\n「It's fine, I can manage it myself. You go keep Xiao Yi company and watch TV.」 Doctor Lin said to Zhou Ze.\n\n「There's something I want to ask you.」 Zhou Ze said, looking at Doctor Lin.\n\n「Hm?」 Doctor Lin looked up, a little surprised. 「How about you ask after I've finished making this meal? I don't want to be distracted. Actually, I rarely cook, and I'm afraid it won't suit your taste.」\n\nWatching her meticulously cut vegetables, piece by piece, Zhou Ze suddenly felt some words were difficult to utter.\n\n「I'll go back to the room first. Come up later.」\n\n「Okay, once I've finished the dishes, I'll come up and call you down for dinner.」\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the kitchen and, under his sister-in-law's surprised gaze, went upstairs to the second floor.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze saw the large bed. He had slept on that bed, while Doctor Lin had slept on a mat on the floor beneath it.\n\nHe actually didn't have much attachment to this place.\n\nHe looked up and saw the wedding photo hanging on the wall above the bed.\n\nIn the wedding photo,\n\nThe two people in wedding attire were a bit far apart; the woman was dignified and serene, the man timid and restrained. It was Doctor Lin and Xu Le's wedding photo.\n\nA single wedding photo could actually reveal many issues.\n\nAnd now,\n\nThe one with the face of the man in the wedding photo,\n\nWas himself.\n\nZhou Ze kept staring at the wedding photo.\n\nIf this entire matter, including the murder's progression, was orchestrated by Doctor Lin behind the scenes, watching from above, with complete insight.\n\nThen,\n\nThe former Xu Le,\n\nThe Xu Le who used to lie alone on this large bed every night,\n\nWhat kind of role did he really play?\n\nLike a lump of dough, and this lump of dough finally mustered up a rare madness and courage in his life,\n\nYet,\n\nAll his actions were actually seen by his wife, who treated him as a marionette,\n\nWatching him walk forward step by step.\n\nEven, in the end, she personally cleaned up the traces.\n\nThose who deserved to die, died.\n\nXu Le also died.\n\nAnd,\n\nEven his body was cleaned out and vacated,\n\nOnly to welcome the arrival of a soul she favored.\n\nHis vision, at this moment, seemed somewhat blurry.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to see,\n\nIn the wedding photo above the bed,\n\nIn Xu Le's eyes,\n\nTwo streams of bloody tears,\n\nSlowly dripping down…\n\n---\n*  **Light under the lamp (燈下黑):** An idiom referring to a blind spot or something obvious that is overlooked, similar to \"hidden in plain sight.\"\n**  **Strike while he's down (趁他病要他命):** Literally \"take advantage of his illness to kill him.\" Means to seize an opportunity to destroy or defeat someone when they are at their weakest.\n***  **Dignified young lady (大家閨秀):** A well-bred, graceful, and virtuous young woman from a good family.\n****  **Ignorance is bliss (難得糊塗):** Literally \"difficult to be muddled.\" An idiom suggesting that it's sometimes better to not know the full truth or to be slightly confused.\n***** **Sponge off others (打秋風):** Literally \"to beat the autumn wind.\" An idiom meaning to ask for gifts or money from others under various pretexts; to scrounge.",

    "content": "「Hey, Xu Le, dinner's ready!」\n\nThe sister-in-law stood at the stairwell, calling upstairs.\n\nThis shout startled Zhou Ze awake from his recent daze.\n\nThe bedroom was still that bedroom,\n\nThe bed was still that bed,\n\nThe wedding photo on the wall was as before, without the slightest change.\n\nReaching out, Zhou Ze rubbed his eyes, turned around, pushed open the bedroom door, and walked downstairs.\n\nOn the dining table in the living room, three dishes and one soup were laid out.\n\nA plate of celery fried beef, a plate of Kung Pao chicken, a plate of stir-fried cabbage with glass noodles, and a bowl of vegetable and tofu soup.\n\nDoctor Lin was standing by the table serving rice, while the sister-in-law was already seated, impatient.\n\n「Some people, they just have no conscience. Their wife is cooking in the kitchen, and they're up there just idling around.」\n\nThe sister-in-law swayed her body while eating.\n\nZhou Ze also sat down. Doctor Lin handed the chopsticks to Zhou Ze.\n\n「From now on, come home for dinner.」\n\nDoctor Lin said suddenly.\n\nLike a gentle wife entrusting her husband, as if everything was as usual, everything normal, like a gentle spring rain.¹\n\n「Huh?」 The sister-in-law's eyes widened.\n\nXu Le is coming back?\n\nOr did her own sister personally ask for it?\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\nThe sister-in-law couldn't hold back, extending her leg under the table to kick Zhou Ze.\n\nYou idiot, why aren't you responding?\n\nMy sister just told you to come home for dinner!\n\nShe's willing to cook for you,²\n\nWhy aren't you being more proactive?\n\n「We'll see,」 Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n「Could we live in that neighborhood?」\n\nDoctor Lin spoke again.\n\nThat neighborhood, of course, referred to the neighborhood Zhou Ze lived in in his previous life.\n\nClearly, Doctor Lin also knew that Zhou Ze, living in her house, got along unhappily with her parents. Therefore, she was willing to go to that home with Zhou Ze,\n\nA place,\n\nWhere it would be just the two of them.\n\nThe chopsticks in Zhou Ze's hand trembled slightly. He could sense that this woman hadn't fully overcome the psychological barriers she'd mentioned earlier, but she was trying hard to look forward.\n\nLife was already a muddle, so just continue muddling through, and do it a little better.\n\nMany people always harbored a longing for a refined life, yet a truly refined life doesn't exist, just like some glamorous female stars might have worked at a bar in their youth.\n\nUpon closer inspection, any perfect thing would always have its flaws at some point.\n\nSeizing the present moment was the true meaning of life.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze hesitated.\n\nSome questions he didn't ask, because Doctor Lin had sent the sister-in-law to call him down, instead of coming up herself. But undeniably, Zhou Ze himself was actually somewhat afraid to ask that question.\n\nOnce the facade was completely torn down,\n\nWhat he had originally seen as a gift from heaven, a compensation to him,\n\nWith all its disguises removed,\n\nMight become something he couldn't bear to look at.\n\nZhou Ze admitted that, like most men, he liked beautiful women. It was just that this time, he was a little scared.\n\nIn his mind, he found it difficult to imagine a scene of living at home with Doctor Lin, eating together at the dining table.\n\nThis feeling,\n\nWas like being a pet cat, favored by its owner. All your actions, including resistance, would just seem more like coquetry.\n\n「No need.」\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe then picked up a mouthful of food and put it into his mouth, his expression serious, swallowing it with great difficulty.\n\n「Is it not tasty?」 Doctor Lin asked.\n\nShe saw that Zhou Ze was in great discomfort while eating.\n\n「Hey, Xu Le, you're putting on airs now, mister!」\n\nThe sister-in-law couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nIn her eyes, Xu Le was bullying her sister.\n\nZhou Ze put down his chopsticks, deciding not to force himself to eat anymore. He turned to Doctor Lin and said:\n\n「Come with me for a moment, I need to say something.」\n\nDoctor Lin nodded and put down her chopsticks.\n\n「Hey, what can't you say in front of me?!」\n\nThe sister-in-law said indignantly. She felt like she was a third wheel,³ yet she lacked the self-awareness of being one.\n\nZhou Ze went upstairs, and Doctor Lin followed him.\n\nThe two stood at the doorway of the second-floor bedroom. Zhou Ze didn't push the door open and enter. He didn't want to see that wedding photo again; he always felt that Xu Le in the wedding photo was looking at him.\n\nAnd Xu Le,\n\nActually, with him,\n\nWas no different.\n\nBoth were tools,\n\nOne a high-level tool, one a low-level tool,\n\nThere was no need for the pot to call the kettle black.⁴\n\n「Go on,」 Doctor Lin said, looking at Zhou Ze, her head slightly bowed.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a long time. The words were on the tip of his tongue, but he didn't know how to speak them,\n\nWas it an accusation?\n\nA verification?\n\nA reprimand?\n\nA curse?\n\nOr perhaps, a mutual confession?\n\nIn truth, ultimately, things had already been done.\n\nThe people who should die, had all died,\n\nAnd the vacated body had also been entered by him.\n\nThe matter, in fact, was already nearing its end.\n\n「Let's just end it here.」\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nAs he finished speaking, Zhou Ze kept staring at the woman in front of him.\n\nAs if this gentle and dignified woman in front of him would, in the next moment, tear off all her disguises, pin him against the wall, and mock his overestimation of himself.\n\nYou're just my doll,\n\nMy favorite toy,\n\nTo get you,\n\nI put in so much effort,\n\nAs a toy,\n\nDo you have the right to say it's over?\n\nHuman imagination,\n\nIs the most terrifying kind of instinct.\n\nIt contained too many psychological suggestions, just like last time Zhou Ze was at Wang Ke's house.\n\nWhat meat exactly did Wang Ke eat,\n\nWho knows?\n\nEven if he explicitly analyzed the matter of psychological suggestion for you, was it frankness or an attempt to cover up?\n\nIt's unclear.\n\nJust like the scene before Zhou Ze's eyes,\n\nAfter hearing Zhou Ze's words,\n\nDoctor Lin just smiled, then nodded. Zhou Ze saw her eyes were a little red, as if carrying a heartbreak. She had spent a lot, a lot of time adjusting her emotions and coming to terms with things.\n\nAt the dinner table just now, she had decided to cast aside her previous burdens and try to get along with Zhou Ze. But Zhou Ze refused, and immediately after, she heard Zhou Ze's true words of separation.\n\nShe lost her legal husband, even though her husband was still alive. She lost the person she liked, because the person she liked said they didn't want to continue this bond.\n\nShe was like a small boat, constantly bobbing up and down in the waves.\n\nListening to her parents, listening to her family's words, listening to Zhou Ze's words, listening to her mentor's words, she lived strongly, and lived with great resilience.\n\nFate had played a trick on her,\n\nSome things, she had held onto, pursued, overcome, but in the end, they would still be missed.\n\n「The divorce agreement, I'll bring it tomorrow. You agree, right?」 Zhou Ze looked at Doctor Lin.\n\nLike a tourist watching a tiger in a zoo from behind a fence.\n\nA very complex emotion,\n\nAs long as she didn't truly reveal her true colors,\n\nThis complexity would continue to persist in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nAfter all,\n\nThis was a society that judged by appearance,\n\nAnd she was so beautiful.\n\nRight?\n\nWhen hitting Xu Dachuan, he had a face full of wrinkles anyway, so there was no psychological pressure at all.\n\nBut if you asked Zhou Ze to take something now and hit Doctor Lin,\n\nHe really couldn't bring himself to do it.\n\n「Okay, let's divorce.」 Doctor Lin raised her head, looking at Zhou Ze. 「You can also start your new life.」\n\nYou agreed?\n\nYou really agreed?\n\nYou really, really agreed?\n\nZhou Ze looked at Doctor Lin,\n\nAfraid that in the next instant, Doctor Lin would instantly turn hostile, then attack him, telling him that a toy should know its place!\n\nBut all of Doctor Lin's expressions seemed so natural, so natural that Zhou Ze found it somewhat unreal.\n\nShe was the director,\n\nAnd at the same time,\n\nThe actress?\n\n「Xu Le is dead,」 Zhou Ze said. 「Is that related to you?」\n\nWhat needed to be asked, ultimately had to be asked.\n\nDoctor Lin nodded.\n\nIn her view, fate seemed to be a game playing tricks on people. It was her obsession that had brewed this tragedy.\n\n「Actually, all of this might be my fault. It was my wild fantasy that allowed fate to play such a joke.\n\nYou're right,\n\nNow is the time to end the joke.」\n\n「Sis, are you crying?」\n\nThe sister-in-law walked up the stairs at this moment, seeing her sister crying.\n\n「It's nothing, dust got into my eyes.」\n\nDoctor Lin didn't want her sister to see her in this state, so she directly pushed open the bedroom door and walked into the bedroom. The sister-in-law glared at Zhou Ze, then followed her sister into the bedroom.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nHe felt a little relieved,\n\nLike a heavy burden had been lifted.\n\nShe admitted it,\n\nShe also agreed to end it,\n\nIf it ends, then let it end.\n\nHe couldn't go back to his previous life anyway. The people who should die had all died, except for this woman.\n\nBut honestly,\n\nIf he really had the chance to kill her, could he truly bring himself to do it?\n\nAnd was the purpose of killing her merely to vent his anger?\n\nHe walked into the bathroom,\n\nZhou Ze cupped a handful of water and splashed it on his face.\n\nThe coolness washed over him, making his mind a little clearer.\n\nIt's over,\n\nIt's over,\n\nIt's finally over,\n\nHe would return to the bookstore later, no longer bothering with any disturbances brought by this 「Xu Le」 identity, and prepare to live his own life.\n\nBecome a ghost messenger,\n\nBecome a full-time employee,\n\nIn his previous life, as a doctor, he could climb step by step,\n\nIn this life,\n\nIt was just a change of environment,\n\nBut the same workplace.\n\nHe looked up,\n\nZhou Ze saw someone standing behind him in the mirror,\n\nIt was the sister-in-law.\n\n「You made my sister cry, she cried very sadly.」\n\n「Things here are very complicated; it's not something a child like you can understand.」\n\nZhou Ze picked up a towel and wiped his face.\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze froze,\n\nStopping all his current movements,\n\nHe saw the sister-in-law in the mirror,\n\nHer head was bent to the left to an extremely exaggerated degree, a degree that a normal person simply couldn't achieve.\n\nHer face was pressed tightly against her left shoulder, her entire face tilted a perfect ninety degrees, but her body still stood perfectly straight.\n\n「I know my sister likes you,\n\nI know my sister doesn't like Xu Le,\n\nI know my sister doesn't want to upset Mom and Dad and isn't willing to break this marriage,\n\nTo make my sister happy,\n\nI made Xu Le die,\n\nMade you die and then come back,\n\nMade you become Xu Le.\n\nI did all this, originally my sister should have been happy,\n\nBut you,\n\nYou actually made her sad again,\n\nHeh heh...」\n---\n¹ Literally 'spring wind turns into rain,' describing a gentle, subtle, and pervasive influence.\n² Literally 'she's willing to cook noodles for you to eat.' In this context, the sister-in-law's subsequent thought implies a suggestive double meaning of deeper intimacy.\n³ Literally 'big light bulb,' an idiom for a third wheel.\n⁴ Literally 'fifty paces mocks a hundred paces,' an idiom for someone criticizing another for a fault they also possess, but often to a lesser degree.",

    "content": "The night was hazy. In the bedroom, Doctor Lin, who had just been crying alone, was now lying sideways on the bed, her willow brows slightly furrowed, already asleep. However, between her brows, a pall of black light seemed to envelop them.\n\nShe didn't want to sleep, but she had to.\n\nHer younger sister didn't want the upcoming events to disturb her.\n\nMeanwhile, in the bathroom, separated by just a wall, Zhou Ze continued to hold the towel;\n\nThe sister-in-law* tilted her head, standing ramrod straight, still staring at him.\n\nThe scene,\n\nat this moment, seemed to solidify, and became so heavy that it was as if the ink on an ink wash painting had started to drip due to its intensity.\n\nZhou Ze had not thought it would be her; he really never had.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's view, she was just a naive child, with a touch of haughtiness and a bit of innocent cheerfulness. What's more, she had previously been in this very bathroom, and when she opened the door, she had seen him suffer a backlash from saving someone at the hospital, which scared her so badly she peed herself.\n\nIf this was also a type of acting,\n\nit was too dedicated.\n\nMoreover, the reason she gave, which seemed sound, was in reality far-fetched. Of course, some people's brain circuits might just be this strange and unique.\n\nShe only had her own singular worldview, only cared about her own feelings, and only understood right and wrong as she perceived them.\n\nThis world,\n\nwhether it had seven billion people or just one, made no difference to her.\n\nThe sister-in-law began to walk forward.\n\nZhou Ze was a gift she had given to her own sister, a gift meant to amuse her sister and make her happy. But now, this gift had made her sister even sadder.\n\nAs a gift, he was unsatisfactory.\n\nUnsatisfactory things,\n\nmust be discarded,\n\nmust be destroyed,\n\nand he thus had no need to continue existing.\n\nZhou Ze put down the towel. From between his ten fingers, black nails slowly grew out.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nA vibrating sound came.\n\nZhou Ze only felt a violent stinging pain in his eardrums, his vision also blurred for a moment, and then, that head-tilting face had already appeared right in front of him.\n\nShe looked at him with her head tilted, carrying the innocent cheerfulness of a young girl, with a lingering cute innocence still tinged with childishness.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nHis chest clothes ripped open. Zhou Ze was sent flying backward, shattering the mirror behind him. A bloody wound appeared on his chest, and fresh blood gushed out.\n\n\"Why couldn't you just live peacefully?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law muttered to herself.\n\nAnd then,\n\nanother sharp crack sounded on Zhou Ze's body. If Zhou Ze hadn't instinctively turned his body sideways, his neck might have been broken off. But even so, a clear bloody gash appeared on his neck.\n\n\"Why couldn't you just be together happily?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law's lips curved into a smile.\n\nShe seemed to be asking Zhou Ze,\n\nand also seemed to be asking herself,\n\nbut the essence was the same:\n\nshe wasn't prepared to receive any answer at all.\n\n\"Are you a Ghost Messenger?\"* Zhou Ze was somewhat unable to comprehend. \"If you are a Ghost Messenger, how can you kill so many people indiscriminately?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law paid him no mind; only the smile at the corner of her lips became deeper.\n\nZhou Ze's pupils constricted, and his body rolled forward and sideways. The sink behind him and all the glass in the bathroom collectively shattered at this moment.\n\n\"Shatter!\"\n\nAll around, shards of glass shot out everywhere, making this narrow bathroom instantly stunningly beautiful.\n\nStreaks of blood swirled,\n\nglass fragments shimmered wildly.\n\nThis was a perfect spot for wedding photos,\n\nas long as the bride wasn't afraid of being disfigured.\n\n\"You people, why are you so troublesome?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law raised her hand.\n\nAnd at this very moment,\n\nZhou Ze's hand also reached out.\n\nThe sharp black nails directly stabbed towards the sister-in-law's palm.\n\nHowever, the originally sharp nails instantly turned \"pliant as silk around a finger\"* at this moment. The skin on the sister-in-law's palm was \"delicate enough to be broken by a puff of air\"*, yet Zhou Ze's nails couldn't pierce it at all.\n\n\"Can't you people just make it easier for me?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law's fingers clamped down. To an outsider, it would look like she was interlocking Zhou Ze's fingers tightly.\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze felt an excruciating pain.\n\n\"Fingers connected to the heart\"*.\n\nAnd now Zhou Ze's fingernails were slowly being pried up, as if someone was using pliers to pull out your fingernails. That pain, stemming from the depths of the soul, was even more despair-inducing, completely exceeding the limits of physical torture.\n\nAll this time, for Zhou Ze, his always victorious nails had completely lost their former might in front of the sister-in-law.\n\nThe smile at the corner of the sister-in-law's lips became even deeper.\n\n\"You dare to use what I gave you to deal with me?\"\n\nThe next moment,\n\nblack long nails also grew from the sister-in-law's fingertips, and directly pierced into Zhou Ze's palm.\n\nFirst was the pain of his fingernails peeling from his body, followed by the torture of being pierced by nails himself.\n\nThis kind of punishment, which he used to inflict on others, now landed on Zhou Ze himself for the first time.\n\n\"I'm not wrong. You are.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law continued to mutter to herself, and then pushed Zhou Ze forward.\n\n\"Why don't you just live a good life?\"\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nZhou Ze was flung away, crashing into the wall. On the five fingers of his right hand, blood was gushing, flesh was mangled, and there were five nail holes, a horrifying sight.\n\n\"I put in so much effort, why can't you... live a good life?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law kept questioning herself,\n\nlike a curious baby,\n\nbut her appearance at this moment was truly not cute at all.\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe sister-in-law raised her arm.\n\nShe was still half a meter away from Zhou Ze,\n\nbut Zhou Ze perceived as if a hand had already gripped his neck and lifted him up. The stinging pain and burning sensation at his neck were so clear, and he could no longer breathe.\n\nHis feet were already off the ground. He was like a prisoner hoisted onto a stake, awaiting judgment from the fate before him.\n\nTilted head,\n\nsmiling.\n\n\"Who else gave you the courage to still dare to come and question me, after knowing the shadow behind these events?\n\nYou are merely a puppet controlled in the palm of my hand.\n\nWho gave you the illusion that you could resist?\"\n\n\"Ugh... ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to make some sound, wanted to speak, but because his neck was firmly choked, Zhou Ze couldn't utter any clear syllables at all.\n\nAs a condemned prisoner,\n\neven the right to a dying declaration had been stripped away.\n\nThe sister-in-law was asking questions, but she hadn't given him the right to answer.\n\n\"Lin Yi, I tried my best, but this game, it's really not that fun.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law spoke to herself.\n\nAnd then,\n\nshe turned her head in another direction,\n\ncontinued,\n\ntilting her head.\n\n\"Your sister is still unhappy. Your sister, she's so annoying.\"\n\nImmediately after,\n\nshe tilted her head again in yet another direction.\n\n\"After we kill him, and then kill your sister too, we'll have no more worries,\n\nRight?\"\n\nZhou Ze only felt the force on his neck suddenly intensify.\n\nThat terrifying suffocating sensation assailed him like an overwhelming tide.\n\nHis lungs burned with pain, almost bursting.\n\nHis eyes began to turn white, his body's convulsions were uncontrollable. This was a sign of impending death, an announcement of his body's complete surrender to death.\n\nMeanwhile, the sister-in-law in front kept tilting her head ninety degrees in different directions, muttering to herself, as if she were communicating with someone else.\n\nJust like two little girls with Peppa Pig backpacks standing together in front of a claw machine,\n\ndiscussing which doll to grab,\n\nwhich doll was easier to get out,\n\nand which doll looked cuter.\n\n\"Cough... cough...\"\n\nCoughing sounds came.\n\nThe sister-in-law surprisingly raised her head, looking at Zhou Ze, who was above her.\n\nShe was a bit surprised.\n\nNot dead yet?\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe smile on her face slowly became serious.\n\n\"What's going on with you?\"\n\nYes,\n\nWhat's going on with you?\n\nZhou Ze's eyes began to glow green, a bronze glow on his body began to slowly spread out, and the nails on his right hand, which had been broken off earlier, actually grew back.\n\nThis time, they weren't black like before, but from top to bottom, they revealed a weathered patina.\n\nZhou Ze's lips parted.\n\nTwo fangs slowly emerged.\n\nGreen-faced and fanged,\n\neerie and terrifying, carrying an aura detested by both humans and ghosts.\n\nThe force that had been binding Zhou Ze's neck suddenly dissipated at this moment. Zhou Ze slowly landed on his feet, squatted down, one hand propped on the broken tiles, and then, slowly raised his head.\n\nThose pair of eerie green eyes stared fixedly at the head-tilting sister-in-law in front of him.\n\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\n\"What's going on here?\"\n\nShe was confused,\n\nbecause the toy she had created, or rather, the gift she had personally chosen and packaged for her sister, had actually undergone an unexpected change.\n\nA change she had not foreseen.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nA hoarse voice came from Zhou Ze's throat. He slowly spread his arms, and he slowly stood up.\n\nVery slowly,\n\nbut very determined.\n\nJust like last time,\n\nhalf of Zhou Ze's skin turned bronze, while the other large portion of his skin began to break and crack. Blood slowly began to seep out.\n\nThe head-tilting sister-in-law watched Zhou Ze walk towards her step by step.\n\nShe was somewhat confused,\n\nand a bit at a loss.\n\n\"Are you Zhou Ze?\"\n\nThis time, the sister-in-law needed Zhou Ze to answer.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to give her any answer.\n\nThe sister-in-law reached out her hand, but this time Zhou Ze was not flung away. He still walked steadily, step by step.\n\nJust like that,\n\nhe walked up to her.\n\nThe sister-in-law's nails stabbed into Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nThe nails pierced in.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe nails had just pierced the skin, and in an instant, the muscles at the wound site immediately contracted, firmly trapping the sister-in-law's nails inside his body.\n\nShe tried to pull them out,\n\nbut couldn't pull them out at all.\n\nAs if countless small mouths inside were sucking on her nails.\n\nVery tight,\n\nvery constricting.\n\nThe sister-in-law looked at Zhou Ze, looking at those green eyes. A look of realization appeared on her face, muttering:\n\n\"You... you were already a dead man before...\"\n\nAnd Zhou Ze reached out,\n\ngrabbed the sister-in-law's head.\n\nThe sister-in-law tried to resist, but couldn't.\n\n\"Crack crack...\"\n\nLike the sound of bones slowly grinding,\n\nZhou Ze's hand held the sister-in-law's head.\n\nHe didn't crush it.\n\nDidn't pierce it.\n\nBut slowly straightened her tilted face,\n\npulled it back to straight.\n\nPhew.\n\nThe face was straight.\n\nIt looked,\n\nmuch more comfortable.\n\n---\n*Translator's note: \"小姨子\" (xiǎo yí zi) specifically refers to the wife's younger sister.\n*Translator's note: \"鬼差\" (guǐ chāi) are supernatural beings in Chinese mythology responsible for escorting the souls of the deceased to the underworld.\n*Translator's note: \"繞指柔\" (rào zhǐ róu) literally means \"soft enough to wrap around a finger,\" an idiom describing extreme pliability or softness.\n*Translator's note: \"吹彈可破\" (chuī tán kě pò) literally means \"can be broken by blowing or flicking,\" an idiom describing extremely delicate or tender skin.\n*Translator's note: \"十指連心\" (shí zhǐ lián xīn) literally means \"ten fingers connected to the heart,\" an idiom describing intense pain or emotional distress felt through the fingers, implying deep connection or extreme sensitivity.",

    "content": "兩張臉，\n\n對視著，\n\n小姨子很想反抗，但是她的臉在周澤手掌之下，一點反抗的餘地都沒有。\n\n這一刻，\n\n她體會到了當初天台上青衣娘娘的感覺。\n\n你縱有千般變化，也無處下口。\n\n一名殭屍，是由死而生的一種存在。他之所以被神憎鬼厭，是因為他不在原本的遊戲規則裡，是一個異數。\n\n就像是大家都不剪辮子你卻已剪了辮子時，\n\n就像是大家都剪了辮子你卻還留著辮子時，\n\n和大家不同，自然就會被討厭和排斥。\n\n周澤慢慢地張開嘴，\n\n兩顆獠牙顯露而出，帶來森然的壓迫。\n\n小姨子皺著眉頭，她的身體在顫抖，也在惶恐。\n\n原本屬於自己的一場遊戲，卻走向了她不可控的方向，甚至，連她自己都不得不被捲入其中。現在，想拔掉電源關閉遊戲都不可能了。\n\n她不知道自己到底放出了怎樣的一個怪胎，甚至，她也確信，周澤自己可能都不清楚他其實是一個怪胎。\n\n這是一個美麗的誤會，也是一個讓人猝不及防的地雷，\n\n很不幸，\n\n她踩上去了，\n\n而且還在地雷上跳了一段拉丁舞。\n\n獠牙慢慢地下壓，已經觸及到了小姨子的脖頸肌膚，\n\n那光滑的肌膚，\n\n那柔嫩的表皮，\n\n帶著少女的靈動，\n\n孕育著青春的氣息，\n\n多少少男渴望在這裡一親芳澤，\n\n多少少男渴望在這裡留下自己的牙印；\n\n「我是她，她也是我。」\n\n小姨子開口道，\n\n「你咬死我，她也死了。」\n\n這是威脅，\n\n一種迫不得已的威脅，\n\n如果不是情況已經危急到急切的地步，小姨子不會開口這般威脅。\n\n因為這等於是自己在向一個玩具低頭，在向一個玩具求饒，\n\n她有自己的尊嚴，\n\n但尊嚴在生命受到威脅的時刻，一下子又變得分文不值。\n\n周澤愣了一下，綠色的眼眸帶著妖異的光芒在小姨子臉上掃了掃，像是在猶豫，像是在思考，也像是在盤桓。\n\n然後，他抬起頭，讓自己的獠牙和其肌膚距離拉遠了一點，先前濃郁到令人窒息的壓迫感也一下子變淡了許多。\n\n小姨子長舒一口氣，一種死裡逃生的感覺襲來，讓她有些眩暈。\n\n然後，周澤又猛地低下頭！\n\n「噗！」\n\n沒有任何的前戲，\n\n也沒有給你過多的心理準備，\n\n就這樣，帶著乾澀，帶著鋒銳，帶著粗壯，\n\n帶著堅硬，\n\n直接進入！\n\n之前抬頭的動作，更像是一種玩弄，一種調侃，一種欲蓋彌彰，一種……**。\n\n如同在說：\n\n我只是在外面蹭蹭，不進去，放心吧，\n\n然後，\n\n剛猛地直入！\n\n毫不憐惜，\n\n也不懂憐惜到底是什麼意思。\n\n獠牙刺入，\n\n鮮血和體液開始迸濺，\n\n人的身體，在這種時候會顯得很是脆弱。\n\n小姨子的頭還是被周澤用手壓著，她臉上呈現出一種極為痛苦的表情，眼眸深處，也出現了慌亂和掙扎；\n\n先前的淡定，早就無影無蹤。\n\n之前，她在衛生間裡，\n\n一邊自問自答，\n\n一邊將周澤逼上了絕路，\n\n現在，\n\n出來混的，總是要還的。\n\n殭屍其實不吃人，也不喝人血的。\n\n早期的古人小說志怪記載裡，鮮有提及殭屍吃人吃人血，而現代大家對殭屍的認知很多是來自港片時代的殭屍片，不過當時受到了一些歐美電影裡喪屍的影響，加入了這些設定。\n\n周澤並沒有吮吸對方的鮮血，他只是很享受這種感覺，通過自己的獠牙，將自己的意志注入對方的體內。\n\n這是一種主權的宣誓，這是一種最直接的報復，\n\n讓自己的氣息，凌駕於對方之上，\n\n折磨她，\n\n撕咬她，\n\n將她剛剛施加給自己的東西，\n\n盡數奉還！\n\n「啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！！！！！！！！！！！」\n\n小姨子身上，忽然升騰出一縷黑氣，這些黑氣慢慢地凝實出一具黑衣女人的身形。\n\n女人一出來，四周的溫度就開始降低，甚至還出現了白霜。\n\n你可以說這是最終頭目出場時的特效和排場，\n\n但實際上，這是女人靈魂力量收不住在揮發的徵兆，她就像是一塊離開冰櫃的冰，雖然依舊散發著寒意，但根本支撐不了多久。\n\n「吼！」\n\n周澤撤開自己的獠牙，小姨子脖頸位置的傷口瞬間結疤，一滴血都沒流出來。\n\n手鬆開，\n\n小姨子的身體直接落在了地上，\n\n摔得發出「咚」的一聲，\n\n沒有任何的可憐，也沒有任何的顧慮，\n\n哪怕這個女孩摔成一個智力障礙者，也和周澤沒絲毫的關係。\n\n女人的靈魂在慢慢地萎靡，她似乎很想再度進入這具身體，但周澤就站在下面，她不敢下去。\n\n同一時間，在女人身邊，有一道冊子正在飛舞，那是和周澤身上所擁有的一模一樣的冊子，這枚冊子意味著女人的身份，\n\n她也是一個冥府使者。\n\n不過，女人的冊子已經近乎泛白，破損不堪，乃至於在飛舞時，還不斷地掉落下碎屑，顯然早就不堪重負了。\n\n「我也是冥府使者，你不能殺我。」\n\n女人戰戰兢兢地說道，她不是怕周澤到這種地步，而是她覺得無比的寒冷。\n\n脫離了肉身的她，\n\n就像是一個普通人脫光了衣服站在南極冰川上一樣，\n\n那種滋味，真的不是說靠精神意志力就能夠抵禦得了的。\n\n周澤抬起頭，\n\n看著她，\n\n嘴巴微微張開，\n\n像是在笑，\n\n而後，\n\n周澤慢慢地，\n\n歪頭。\n\n骨節不斷地發出著脆響，\n\n但頭還是歪了下來，\n\n嘲諷，\n\n最直接的嘲諷。\n\n女人的身上慢慢地開始浮現出淡藍的火焰，她的靈魂正在被冰化，漸漸地失去活性，她很冷，迫切地需要一個溫暖的港灣。\n\n她等不及了，也沒辦法再等待了。\n\nbiu！\n\n她身形向下，企圖再度進入小姨子的體內。\n\n「吼！」\n\n周澤手臂揮舞過去，沒之前顏色通透但看起來更富有滄桑感的指甲直接掃中了女人，女人發出了一聲厲嘯，最後被周澤強行抓住，拘在了面前。\n\n女人的腰，是真的只手可握，不是說女人的身材有多好有多誇張，而是意味著女人的靈魂體在周澤的手掌鉗制下不停地被蹂躪翻轉。\n\n「放過我，我是冥府使者！」\n\n女人咆哮道。\n\n周澤把嘴張大，\n\n然後手掌開始向嘴邊送，\n\n女人的掙扎和咆哮更加地劇烈，她已經預感到了即將發生什麼，同時，她也明白過來一件事，眼前的這個男人，已經失去了所有的神智，現在的他，只是靠著一種本能在行事。\n\n他餓了，\n\n他身體很疼，\n\n他軀體很破舊，\n\n就像是一個人生病了，養傷時需要進補一樣，\n\n他現在也需要進補。\n\n這具身體，根本沒辦法承受他現在的形態。\n\n「我是冥府使者，無論做過什麼都只有冥府才能審判我，你不能，你不能！\n\n你想好承受這種代價了麼，\n\n你給我醒醒，\n\n給我醒醒！」\n\n這就像是《西遊記》裡面，走投無路的妖怪面對孫悟空的金箍棒時，會開始自報家門讓自家菩薩或者仙尊領自己回去一樣；這是在表露自己的靠山。\n\n然而，\n\n在那之前，\n\n周澤也是一名冥府使者，雖然是臨時工，\n\n但女人依舊是準備殺了他的。\n\n殺了他，再殺了林醫生，\n\n身體裡的另一個意志，就不會再干擾自己了。\n\n周澤的手停下了，\n\n沒有把對方的靈魂繼續往自己嘴裡送。\n\n女人看著周澤，還是很緊張，有了之前的一次教訓，她不會再有自己逃出生天的幻想。\n\n周澤捏著女人，開始移動，\n\n他的腳步每次落下，都在地板上留下了一道經久不散的黑色印記，他走下了樓，他來到了廚房。\n\n綠色瞳孔的眼眸在廚房裡逡巡，\n\n然後，\n\n他找到了，\n\n一罐老乾媽。\n\n他將罐子捏碎，裡面的辣醬全都遺留在手中，\n\n先將辣醬送入自己嘴裡，\n\n而後，\n\n周澤再度舉起抓住女人的手，\n\n張開嘴，\n\n將女人的靈魂送入了自己的嘴裡。\n\n女人最後的慘叫和咒罵，\n\n仿佛進餐時周圍音響裡所播放的抒情樂曲，給人的進餐帶來了一種異樣的情調。\n\n吞入腹中之後，\n\n周澤撐開雙臂，\n\n「嗝………………」\n\n一個沉沉的嗝兒響起，\n\n舒服了，\n\n滿足了，\n\n飽了，\n\n但好想再吃一個啊。\n\n………………\n\n「你之前怎麼不早說！」\n\n白鶯鶯在車裡罵道。\n\n唐詩沒搭理這頭接近暴走的女性屍體，而是繼續剝開白色兔子奶油糖的包裝送入自己嘴裡，\n\n「他之前自己沒細問，不感興趣。\n\n而且，\n\n我怎麼知道通城另一個冥府使者居然就在他老婆家裡？」\n\n「好了，姑奶奶們，到了，到了！」\n\n老道士還是司機，\n\n他回到書店後說起周澤的行蹤，\n\n讓唐詩聽到了，\n\n然後這個不是秘密的秘密才被公開，再接下來打周澤的手機打不通，眾人這才趕過來。\n\n許清朗坐在副駕駛位置，一臉陰沉。\n\n車停了下來，\n\n眾人下了車往裡走，\n\n白鶯鶯走在第一個，\n\n當她走到樓道口時，\n\n白鶯鶯忽然停下了腳步，\n\n她在前面不遠處，感應到了一種熟悉的氣息，仿佛自己體內的煞氣都因此受到牽引而開始顫慄起來。\n\n「你怎麼了？」\n\n唐詩見白鶯鶯不走了，問道。\n\n白鶯鶯緊咬嘴唇，\n\n裡面的那種呼應的氣息越來越明顯，而且似乎還提升到了一個巔峰，比之前更加地清晰和刺激。\n\n這種血統和種族羈絆之間的聯繫，像是一道道電流不停地在她身上流竄。\n\n她下意識地夾緊雙腿，\n\n顫聲道：\n\n「人家下面忽然，\n\n好癢啊！」",

    "content": "叮 dong……\n\nLike the sound of a stone falling into water, very clear and pleasant to the ear. The original calm rippled as a result.\n\nZhou Ze found himself lying on a pond. Beneath him was the water surface, and this surface was like glass, supporting his body.\n\nEverything around him was a little blurry at first, but slowly began to clear up. After clarity came familiarity.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nThe Yellow Springs Road is always bustling with people, because even without world wars or plagues, people are dying every moment in this world.\n\nMany films and TV shows often have a line: \"I'm afraid you'll be too lonely on the Yellow Springs Road, so I'll (or send someone to) go down to accompany you.\"\n\nIn reality, there's no need to worry about that at all.\n\nWhen you go down, you'll find the Yellow Springs Road very crowded. Moreover, you'll see many white brothers, Black brothers, men, women, old, and young, all around you.\n\nPlump or slender, handsome and charming, or utterly ugly—these outward appearances cannot stop the established rule that you will die;\n\nPrinces, marquises, generals, and prime ministers may rise in glory, but ultimately, they all end up as a mound of earth.*\n\nHowever, most people can't perceive loneliness after descending to the Yellow Springs. Everyone is like a formless walking dead, moving forward little by little, following the flow.\n\nIf the living world is likened to a factory workshop, then Hell is the subsequent factory for waste collection and raw material transformation. Compared to the dizzying array of the living world, Hell places more emphasis on rules and order,\n\nAn order that makes you despair, makes you helpless, yet exists like iron.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up,\n\nThis must be a dream,\n\nHe,\n\nShouldn't be dead.\n\nThere weren't many memories in his mind. He only remembered almost dying in front of his sister-in-law, and then, like being drunk, he blacked out again.\n\nIt was exactly like the last time on the rooftop, as if he had relinquished his body, relinquished everything.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to die, especially at this moment. If he had a choice, Zhou Ze would rather choose to be like those \"walking dead,\" numbly walking on until the next endpoint or starting point.\n\nBut now, he wasn't numb, nor was he dazed. If he died, he would have to endure the torment of all this solitude while fully conscious.\n\nIt was like undergoing a protracted major surgery,\n\nAnd the doctor tells you,\n\n\"Sorry, we're out of anesthetic.\"\n\nHis palm pressed against the pond.\n\nThe pond was empty; from above, one could see straight to the bottom; after all, the surroundings were crystal clear.\n\nThe Faceless Woman hadn't returned yet, but things over there would soon have a conclusion.\n\nThe little loli, the Faceless Woman, Rongcheng—there would finally be a conclusion.\n\nHe looked around,\n\nZhou Ze didn't see the man with the cat he had seen the last time he dreamed of this place. In fact, Zhou Ze rather looked forward to seeing him again.\n\nHe didn't know why, but that man seemed to possess a special magic; being with him made one feel at ease.\n\nPerhaps, this was charisma?\n\nWalking on the water, a mist began to rise around him. A hazy, indistinct feeling slowly crept in, gradually enveloping everything.\n\nRevisiting the old place, there was no surprise, no accident. Nothing seemed to have changed, but Zhou Ze knew that something had changed, and it seemed to be himself.\n\nFor example, this time, when he dreamed of this place again, he seemed much more composed.\n\nWhen the dense fog completely shrouded everything,\n\nZhou Ze felt a sharp ache in his eyes, and then, he smelled the earthy scent of soil.\n\nDamn it,\n\nIt's that earthy smell again.\n\nOpening his eyes, Zhou Ze saw himself lying in the bedroom on the second floor of the bookstore. Old Daoist and the monkey were sitting there playing with mud, and then started smearing it on him.\n\n\"Hehe, this is how you mold it properly. Watch closely, I'll sculpt him some big pecs!\"\n\nOld Daoist, boasting to the monkey, molded a *mantou* (steamed bun) and prepared to stick it onto Zhou Ze.\n\nOnly Old Daoist could turn healing a wound into such vulgar amusement.\n\nHowever, just as Old Daoist was about to stick it on, he saw Zhou Ze on the bed open his eyes. He was startled immediately, then held the mud *mantou* in both hands, somewhat at a loss.\n\n\"Is it tasty?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nThis injury should be much lighter than the last time. Although he didn't know how long he had been unconscious, at least he could speak directly upon waking.\n\nIs it tasty?\n\nOld Daoist was still frozen in place.\n\n\"Is it tasty?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nOld Daoist made a bitter face, lowered his head, took a bite of the mud *mantou*, then nodded tearfully.\n\n\"Fragrant, truly fragrant.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his face away, no longer looking at him.\n\nOld Daoist hurriedly spat out the mud from his mouth, then ingratiatingly said, \"Boss, you're awake! You really scared me. You were unconscious for three days!\"\n\nOnly three days?\n\nHow long was he unconscious last time?\n\nBut why does he always have to smear mud on him every time?\n\nZhou Ze looked at the dirty stains on the bed and his own grimy body. For someone with mysophobia, it was truly unbearable:\n\n\"Call Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"Boss, are you hungry?\" Old Daoist asked.\n\n\"I want to take a bath.\"\n\n\"Let me help you wash, Boss. Back when Old Daoist went to bathhouses to catch ghosts and save the common people, I used to scrub backs in bathhouses. My technique is top-notch!\"\n\nOld Daoist patted his chest.\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe monkey on the side covered its mouth, giggling \"squeak squeak squeak.\"\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say, look, even the monkey is laughing at you,\n\nHow can you have no sense of self-awareness at all?**\n\n\"Call Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"No need, Boss. Come, I'll carry you to the bathroom. This poor Daoist guarantees to scrub you until you're fair and tender.\"\n\nSaying this, Old Daoist eagerly prepared to lift Zhou Ze out of bed.\n\nIf Zhou Ze still had the strength right now, he probably would have grown claws,\n\nAnd opened several new vents on Old Daoist's body.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze was merely a sickly delicate person*** now.\n\nFortunately, Bai Yingying happened to push the door open at this moment, carrying a cup of tea. Seeing Zhou Ze awake, Bai Yingying delightedly put down the things and walked to the bedside.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief.\n\n............\n\nWith the previous experience, Bai Yingying seemed very natural helping Zhou Ze bathe this time.\n\n\"How are things with the Lin family?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, when we got there, you were already unconscious on the floor. The Lin sisters are fine, but their home was in utter chaos, especially the bathroom—the glass and tiles were all shattered.\n\nWe brought you out. Later, no one from the Lin family came to ask anything. I know what you want to ask: the younger Lin sister is back to school normally, and Doctor Lin also went to work.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Looking in the mirror, his hair seemed a bit long. He said to Bai Yingying, \"Help me trim my hair, cut it shorter.\"\n\n\"Alrighty.\"\n\nBai Yingying went out, got scissors, and came back to cut Zhou Ze's hair.\n\nAfter everything was neatly tidied up, Zhou Ze was placed in a wheelchair. The wheelchair was new, sparkling clean, and it was electric, with a joystick, like a bumper car from an amusement park.\n\n\"Who bought this?\" Zhou Ze's face darkened.\n\n\"Boss, do you like it? This poor Daoist specifically prepared it for you, thinking you'd probably need to use it often in the future.\n\nSo I just got one for you.\n\nBoss, look here, this button can be pressed!\"\n\nOld Daoist pressed the button for Zhou Ze as if presenting a treasure,\n\nAnd then the entire wheelchair began to glow with colorful lights,\n\n\"Woo woo woo woo woo\"\n\nAnd a train whistle sound effect.\n\nOld Daoist thought Zhou Ze would surely be very pleased,\n\nLittle did he know that if Zhou Ze's body weren't so weak right now,\n\nHe would have already died twice today.\n\nNot choosing to sit in the wheelchair, Zhou Ze opted for a soft sofa seat by the window in the bookstore.\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't in the shop. It seemed he had something to do at home and had gone back first, but he left behind a lot of juices,\n\nSaying they could be eaten if Zhou Ze woke up.\n\nLife seemed to have returned to its familiar rhythm.\n\nAfter all the commotion, ultimately, nothing had changed.\n\nThe truth was ridiculous, yet it had truly happened.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nTo truly investigate the matter of the ghost messenger's departed soul on his sister-in-law, they would have to wait for the little loli to return. As a ghost messenger who was originally in the same city, it would obviously be impossible for the little loli to know nothing about that ghost messenger.\n\nOf course, that's assuming the little loli can still return.\n\nZhou Ze, the boss, leaned on the sofa, sunbathing through the glass, while Bai Yingying was responsible for greeting customers. Although Xu Qinglang wasn't there, Bai Yingying had already learned how to prepare ordinary pastries and drinks.\n\nAt the table next to Zhou Ze, sat two long-haired women. Their voices were a bit hoarse and a little affected. The two women were flipping through a fashion magazine while chatting, and they grew more and more excited as they talked.\n\n\"Let me tell you, I recently discovered something that worries me a lot.\"\n\n\"Tell me, quick, tell me.\"\n\n\"Last week, I noticed that my stockings and bras, which I had put on top of the washing machine in the bathroom waiting to be washed, had been touched.\"\n\n\"Ah, who touched them? Did someone get into your house? Could it be a thief?\"\n\n\"But nothing was stolen from the house. I thought it was a thief at first too, but then I found out it wasn't.\"\n\n\"Then who touched them?\"\n\n\"It was Xiao Wen. I noticed it that time, it was Xiao Wen. After I finished showering, he went into the bathroom. Then when I went back in, I found my stockings, bras, and other underwear had been rummaged through, and there were wet marks on them.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nThe other woman covered her mouth,\n\n\"How could Xiao Wen be like this?\"\n\n\"I'm troubled too.\"\n\n\"It's fine, maybe Xiao Wen is just growing up and developed a bit of curiosity about women's things. Most boys go through this phase.\"\n\n\"I checked online. If it were just these problems, it would be fine.\"\n\n\"It would be fine? No, it wouldn't. You need to try to guide him and help him establish correct values.\"\n\n\"I originally planned to talk to him frankly, but then I discovered something else. One weekend, I came home early from work, and I saw Xiao Wen in my bedroom wearing my usual stockings, bra, and skirt, standing in front of the mirror, looking at himself.\"\n\n\"This............\"\n\n\"If it were just the previous things, I think I could still guide him. But now things have become very serious. He's actually wearing my clothes and looking in the mirror. This clearly isn't a problem of male puberty anymore.\"\n\n\"Oh, my son's call. I'll take it.\"\n\nThe woman answered the phone, then said to her girlfriend, \"Sorry, my son said he's hungry, I need to go back and feed him.\"\n\n\"Okay, you go back quickly.\"\n\n\"Waiter, check, please.\"\n\nBai Yingying walked over and took the payment.\n\nZhou Ze watched the two long-haired women walk out of the shop, deep in thought.\n\n\"Boss, would you like some more hot water?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"No need.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, picking up his teacup.\n\nBai Yingying stood with one hand on her hip, the other holding the money, and said helplessly:\n\n\"Those two men just now are really sick, aren't they? They're clearly men, but they dressed themselves up as women. Good thing this old lady has eyes like torches.\"\n\n\"Cough cough............\"\n\nZhou Ze, who was drinking water, suddenly choked.\n\n---\n* An idiom for a grave.\n** A colloquial expression meaning to lack self-awareness or a sense of propriety.\n*** Here, referring to physical frailty, not the 'yandere' trope.",
