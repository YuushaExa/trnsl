    "content": "In life, what one fears most is resignation to fate.\n\nBecause resignation to fate means no longer struggling, and thus your life will smoothly proceed along its existing predetermined path, without too many waves or too many surprises.\n\nYou can see what you'll be like five years from now; you can guess what you'll be doing ten years from now.\n\nBut, what life needs most, in fact, is also resignation to fate.\n\nBeing down-to-earth, stable and secure, no longer having miscellaneous thoughts, living one's own life—only a plain and simple existence leads to lasting peace.\n\nWhether to accept one's fate or not is purely a matter of one's own choice.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the bookstore sofa, zoning out for an entire afternoon, as if he had thought a lot, yet also as if he had thought of nothing at all.\n\nIn the glass, a blurry reflection of himself appeared. Unconsciously, he no longer felt awkward when looking in the mirror.\n\nPeople's adaptability is indeed strong. Even your physical body, even your life's trajectory—once you get used to it, you no longer feel anything is amiss.\n\nThis was his bookstore; this was his life from now on.\n\nHe reached out and touched the crew cut Bai Yingying had just trimmed for him.\n\nIt was very clean and sharp.\n\nZhou Ze saw Tang Shi standing at the doorway. She had been standing for three hours, from noon until the afternoon, barely moving.\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask her what she was doing there. Everyone needs a moment to be alone and clear their mind, and at such times, they don't need others' comfort.\n\nHe took out his phone, logged into his WeChat. There were no messages, no replies.\n\nObsessed with his past life's self, obsessed with Xu Le in this life,\n\nZhou Ze was genuinely a little tired.\n\nIn fact, it would be better to just live this life, as his new self, in a down-to-earth manner.\n\nWhether he let go or not, it made no difference,\n\nAfter all, what's past is past,\n\nAnd what's future is still future.\n\nHe took out his small booklet, flipped through it, feeling its texture.\n\nZhou Ze felt that the rest of his life would be intertwined with it, at least, for a very long time.\n\nIt seemed that the female ghost official also had a booklet, but Zhou Ze asked, and Bai Yingying said they hadn't found it. Perhaps that booklet had already vanished with the wind, after all, at that time, the booklet was already showing signs of collapsing, and with the female ghost official's demise, its final purpose would also disappear.\n\nTang Shi finally moved. She slowly squatted down, hands braced on her knees. She might have stood too long, causing her legs to go numb or cramp.\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nThen Tang Shi turned her head, looked at Zhou Ze, who was gloating through the glass, and a smile also appeared on her lips, but this smile seemed a bit subtle.\n\nAs if at this moment, she had become a different person.\n\nThe old her wasn't this serious.\n\nThe little monkey jumped in front of Zhou Ze, waving a toy hammer in its hand. Zhou Ze reached out and patted its head.\n\nAll this time, Zhou Ze hadn't understood what was up with the mud the little monkey got, but it seemed to work quite well. He thought that if running the bookstore didn't make money and he couldn't get by, he could open a pharmacy.\n\n\"Ancestral Five Fingers Mountain Black Jade Bone-Mending Ointment Set\"?\n\nThat's not a bad idea.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak...\"\n\nThe little monkey held a mobile phone in its hand, waving it at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe monkey's phone was bought by Old Daoist, which clearly showed Old Daoist's doting affection for the monkey.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe monkey pointed to the speaker on the bookstore wall, then pointed to the phone.\n\n\"Connecting to the Bluetooth speaker?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe monkey looked utterly bewildered,\n\nbut it seemed that was the case, so it nodded.\n\nZhou Ze took the monkey's phone and helped it connect to Bluetooth. The monkey tried it, playing a song from *Monkey King: Hero Is Back*, and the speaker immediately emitted sound.\n\nThe monkey was very happy.\n\nImmediately after, the background music in the bookstore kept changing in the monkey's hands. Fortunately, there weren't many customers in the bookstore at the moment, so Zhou Ze let the monkey play around.\n\nActually, the background music in many large shopping malls has its nuances.\n\nFor example, if Li Yugang's *A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains*¹ was initially playing, and a mall security guard or internal staff member saw a familiar habitual thief enter the mall, they would immediately notify the reception, and the people there would immediately change the background music.\n\nNext, they might play Michael Jackson's *Beat It*, or perhaps *Hello Poisonous*². Then the shopkeepers would remind customers near them that there was a thief approaching and to be careful.\n\nShopping malls everywhere basically have these unwritten rules. Sometimes even on public buses, if the driver sees a familiar habitual thief board, they'll press a button to send a warning.\n\nSo, sometimes when you're on a bus and hear \"Passengers, please take good care of your personal belongings...\", don't dismiss it as a perfunctory, meaningless voice message.\n\nAnd these thieves,\n\nbasically became entities with their own BGM.\n\nWhen they walked in,\n\ntheir unique BGM would play.\n\nAbove the bookstore's counter, there was a hanging television playing *Shaolin Soccer*.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze realized he hadn't seen Old Daoist all afternoon. However, soon, three \"drip-drop\" sounds came from inside.\n\nThe little monkey understood, adjusted the music, and soon, the Bluetooth speaker began to play:\n\n\"The waves surge... the waves flow... The mighty river waters never cease...\"\n\nAccompanied by the theme song of *The Bund*, Old Daoist, dressed in a brand-new Taoist robe, a complete change from his previous decadent and sloppy appearance, slowly emerged from the staircase.\n\nBehind him, in the stairwell, there must have been an electric fan, blowing his long robe to flutter. Honestly, he really did exude an immortal aura and Taoist bearing.\n\nHolding a peach wood sword,\n\nhe spun a sword flourish.\n\nOld Daoist trod the Seven Stars, majestic and awe-inspiring!\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed his chin. It was fortunate it was Old Daoist; if it were any other Taoist or monk who dared to show off like this in a bookstore run by a ghost, they would have long since died countless times over.\n\nThe little monkey held up the phone, aiming the camera at Old Daoist, adjusting the angle. Zhou Ze glanced over and saw that the little monkey was livestreaming for Old Daoist.\n\nAlright,\n\nthis monkey was indeed clever,\n\na little too clever.\n\nOn the livestream screen, a flurry of bullet comments³ popped up:\n\n\"First floor, mine. Can I eat a bit of shit, no one's watching, right?\"\n\n\"Holy crap, Old Daoist, how the hell are you this afternoon!\"\n\n\"Old Daoist, it's been almost half a year, you're finally livestreaming again!\"\n\n\"Daoist priest, I miss you so much. You've been gone so long, I really, really miss you!\"\n\n\"Daoist priest is naughty, hiding for so long and not coming out, ying ying ying, rub your little willy, ying ying ying.⁴\"\n\n\"Are you still selling hell money? It's out of stock!\"\n\n\"Did you guys see that? There's a tuft of yellow fur on the left side of the camera, what the hell is that? Is it a monkey?\"\n\n\"Hahaha, are you suggesting it's a monkey filming him? The user above must be an idiot, right?\"\n\n\"Agreed, the user above is an idiot.\"\n\n\"First user is right!\"\n\n\"First user is damn right!\"\n\n\"First user is sooo right right right!\"\n\n\"Damn it, aren't the users above me who keep saying 'first user' being unethical? You're killing people with OCD!\"\n\nAs Old Daoist resumed his livestream, the channel's popularity began to soar.\n\nOld Daoist was, for all intents and purposes, an internet celebrity, quite well-known in the outdoor livestreaming field, with a group of loyal, die-hard fans who never abandoned him.\n\nAfter all, those willing to spend money to buy hell money from Old Daoist at a price higher than actual RMB,\n\nthose were absolutely die-hard fans!\n\nOld Daoist performed some sword dancing and martial arts,\n\nwarming up the crowd.\n\nHaving not practiced for a long time, he seemed a little out of breath, but in the next moment, he still threw a handful of paper money into the air:\n\n\"Infinite Heavenly Venerate!\"\n\nHe raised his peach wood sword upwards,\n\n\"Wind, rain, thunder, lightning, heed my command!\"\n\nEach piece of paper money began to automatically revolve around Old Daoist, perfectly aligned, continuously fluttering into various shapes, cooperating with Old Daoist's commands, complementing each other perfectly.\n\n\"Damn, these damn special effects are amazing, definitely not the five-mao kind!⁵\"\n\n\"First user is right!\"\n\n\"This time, the first user is truly right.\"\n\n\"This time, the first user didn't eat shit.\"\n\n\"Is this a livestream or a pre-recorded video, hey!\"\n\n\"Yeah, someone with a big dick confirm⁶, is this a post-processed video?\"\n\n\"It's a livestream, doesn't look like a video!\"\n\n\"Old Daoist, I'm changing my opinion of you. I used to think you were just a goofball, but now I find you're a goofball who can do magic tricks!\"\n\n\"Ying ying ying, tease the user above, ying ying ying.\"\n\n\"Damn, the user above is a pervert, right!\"\n\n\"Punch an 'ying-ying monster' to death!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked towards the doorway.\n\nTang Shi was standing there.\n\nClearly, the fluttering of Old Daoist's hell money was the result of Tang Shi's manipulation.\n\nZhou Ze was very curious as to what, given Tang Shi's nature, made her willing to cooperate with Old Daoist in playing such livestreaming tricks.\n\nThe hell money neatly fell and stacked in Old Daoist's hand. Old Daoist took the phone from the monkey's hand, glanced at the system notifications, and his wrinkled face immediately scrunched up in laughter, like an 'old tender chrysanthemum'⁷.\n\n\"Thanks to Brother Typhoon Hotel for the Super Rocket!\n\nThanks to Brother Old Qiu for the Super Rocket!\n\nThanks to Miss Lan Xue for the Airdrop Supply Crate!\n\nThanks to Book Friend 160107110901124 for the... for the... Big Plane!\n\nOld Daoist, I'm back livestreaming today,\n\nmy viewers,\n\nare you still there!\n\nDear audience friends,\n\nI've missed you all terribly!\"\n\nThe *Shaolin Soccer* movie playing on the TV above the counter happened to reach its middle segment. In the scene, Stephen Chow shouted to his martial brothers:\n\n\"I feel it,\n\nit's back,\n\neveryone's back,\n\neveryone,\n\nhas returned...\"\n___\n¹ *A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains*: A song by Li Yugang, whose title refers to a famous Chinese landscape painting.\n² *Hello Poisonous*: A popular Chinese song by Zhang Yu, often associated with negative or tricky situations.\n³ Bullet comments: Refers to real-time comments that scroll across a video player, commonly used on Chinese livestreaming and video platforms.\n⁴ \"Ying ying ying, rub your little willy, ying ying ying.\": \"Ying ying ying\" (嘤嘤嘤) is an onomatopoeia for whimpering, often used online to feign cuteness, fragility, or helplessness in a performative or annoying way. \"Little willy\" (小管管) is a vulgar term for penis, used here for shock value in the context of the \"ying ying ying\" persona.\n⁵ Five-mao kind: A term used to describe very cheap or poorly made special effects, implying they only cost five *mao* (0.5 RMB, a very small amount).\n⁶ Someone with a big dick confirm: A vulgar internet slang phrase used to ask for a knowledgeable person to confirm information.\n⁷ 'Old tender chrysanthemum': A crude, humorous term used to describe a person's face (typically an old person's) wrinkled up in a way that resembles a chrysanthemum flower, often implying a state of extreme happiness or a humorous comparison to an anus.",

    "content": "April 1, 2018,\n\nTwelve twenty AM,\n\nChengdu,\n\nLight rain,\n\nLight breeze, level 3.\n\nThe Underworld Store on the old street had been closed for a long time. Even the neighbors weren't clear on when this store had actually opened.\n\nBecause unlike breakfast shops on the street that many people visited daily, or clothing stores where one could browse after work and even try on clothes without buying them, most people would rather never step into an Underworld Store to buy anything in their entire lives. Naturally, in their daily lives, they deliberately ignored this Underworld Store.\n\nOf course, when it closed its doors, naturally, not many people paid attention. Only occasionally, upon passing by and seeing the door closed, would they feel slightly surprised.\n\nA fat man would park his police car in front of the shop every few days, look at the closed store, smoke a few cigarettes, and then leave. The hair salon ladies on the old street, who ran the oldest and most passionate trade, were truly distressed by this. Each time, they were so startled that they'd usher the clients they'd just invited in for \"water\"* out the door, not even daring to charge for the \"water.\"\n\nThe massage parlor next to the Underworld Store had also been closed for a long time. It was said that the owner was embroiled in a murder case before the New Year. Although she was later cleared, she had too many family matters and hadn't returned to Chengdu for a long time. Occasionally, old customers would come by, nostalgic for the proprietress's skill. Little did they know that if they frequently sought her massages, while comfortable, the day they'd need to pick out shrouds from the Underworld Store next door would be drawing nearer.\n\nLife remained this kind of life. The teahouses and mahjong parlors in Chengdu's streets and alleys were filled with an air of ease and leisure. This was a city of leisure, a city that knew how to enjoy itself. As winter had just passed and summer had yet to arrive, the entire city was immersed in its own snores—content, comfortable, occasionally turning over, wrapping itself in a thin blanket. Hmm, and continued to sleep.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, the old street was naturally deserted, save for a few late-night food stalls awaiting their sparse business. That Underworld Store, however, was lit. The light was dim, only faintly visible. Ordinary people couldn't even see it.\n\nInside the Underworld Store, two rows of chairs were arranged. In the center, on two seats, sat a long-bearded man on one side, and a small, pink, and adorable loli on the other. To their lower sides, some wore hemp clothes, with long sleeves fluttering; some wore tall hats, swaying unsteadily; some had their eyeballs aligned, occasionally swiveling; some displayed large bellies, fat and greasy. The scent of rouge on their faces was much heavier, even appearing somewhat unreal. Whether they were smiling, picking their ears, or making noise, they always gave off an eerie, oppressive feeling, like the one hundred and eight Arhats in a temple—no matter how endearing their expressions, as an adult, one wouldn't dare to truly mock them. It was as if, in the unseen, a pair of eyes were watching you from above.\n\nIf one looked closer, they would notice that these figures' clothing styles were quite similar to the paper figures displayed in a corner of the Underworld Store, as if the clothes had literally been peeled off the paper figures and put on themselves. Very comical, very ridiculous? But that was genuinely the feeling.\n\nEveryone's lips bore a strange crimson, like rouge deliberately smeared, very exaggerated and glaring. Jia Baoyu said he loved to eat the rouge from his sisters' lips, but if he saw the rouge here, he'd likely be scared out of his wits.\n\nIn the air, the scent of ashes lingered. Among the assembled figures, there was a small brazier containing charcoal. Meanwhile, stacks of underworld currency on a rack would automatically fly over, falling into the charcoal and burning.\n\nAt the doorway stood a woman, a long-haired woman. Her head was slightly bowed, her long hair obscuring her face. Her figure was graceful, her physique alluring—an ordinary person seeing her would likely anticipate her letting down her hair to reveal her true face, for everyone possesses curiosity and a pursuit of beauty. However, none of those present had such thoughts, for they knew this woman... had no face.\n\n“Still not here.” The long-bearded man, seated next to the loli, said in a deep voice, frowning slightly.\n\n“Let everyone wait a bit longer.” The loli said.\n\nThe long-bearded man nodded, then said: “Protect your vitality, and try to prolong our stay in the human world.”\n\nBlack talismans flew out from the long-bearded man's sleeve, drifting down around them. Everyone present reached out and took a talisman, sticking it to their forehead. Even the long-bearded man himself affixed one to his own forehead. Instantly, the entire store became utterly silent. Those with talismans on their foreheads became motionless, as if an immobilization spell had been cast upon them. This made them appear indistinguishable from the paper figures already present in the Underworld Store.\n\nThe loli rose, a talisman also in her hand, and walked over to the faceless woman.\n\nThe faceless woman slowly raised her head, “My clone was destroyed.”\n\n“Just a clone,” the loli said dismissively.\n\n“She was left by me to monitor him,” the faceless woman reminded her. “You tell me, once I return, will there still be a place for him?”\n\nThe loli smiled faintly, “He's just temporarily filling in for me, helping me manage the keys to Hell. One Tongcheng cannot tolerate a third ghost messenger.”\n\n“Then what about me?” the faceless woman asked sharply, “Without me, you wouldn't be able to lure him here.”\n\n“Including me, Tongcheng already has two ghost messengers. One of them is on the verge of collapse. This is the position I've reserved for you.” The loli reached out and gripped the tip of the faceless woman's hair. “Once things here are settled, I will arrange an identity for you to remain in the human world.”\n\nThe faceless woman lowered her head again.\n\n“I'm very curious about one thing: why are you so fixated on that guy? He's merely a plaything created by another one of Tongcheng's own, oh no, merely a gift.”\n\n“A gift?” The head hidden beneath the faceless woman's long hair let out two dry laughs, “In my opinion, this gift is more significant than the one you are waiting for.”\n\nThe loli's eyes narrowed slightly. She could tell there was more to the faceless woman's words. This woman, born by the Yellow Springs Road in a pool of resentment, had existed for a very long time, and naturally knew more untold secrets.\n\n“Oh, in that case, it seems I'll have to properly interrogate him once I return.”\n\nAt this moment, the hair on the faceless woman's face suddenly parted, and where there was no face, a girl's face began to materialize. Her expression was one of great pain, as if she were struggling.\n\n“Her, you still haven't managed to control?” The loli was somewhat surprised.\n\n“She's struggling quite fiercely,” the faceless woman replied. “Her will is firm, no less so than you ghost messengers.”\n\nThe loli smiled faintly, then reached out and threw the talisman in her hand into the charcoal fire, “In the end, it's... just a meaningless struggle.”\n\nThe firelight was faint,\n\nThe night was deep,\n\nA string of sparks spluttered from the brazier:\n\n“Pop”\n\n............\n\n“Pop!”\n\n“Pop!”\n\n“Pop!”\n\nThe old street, in the light rain, carried a hint of chill. Small puddles were visible everywhere on the uneven road.\n\nA man in a hoodie walked slowly along this slightly muddy path. His head was hidden beneath his hoodie's hood, and his figure seemed to completely merge with the darkness behind him.\n\n“Meow.”\n\nBeside him, was an entirely white cat, following him step by elegant step.\n\nMan and cat, cast two long shadows beneath the dim streetlights.\n\nOccasionally, the sound of wind drifted from all directions, empty and faint, circling above the old street, lingering on.\n\nThe man's build wasn't burly, but he exuded a sharp aura. He was like a silent blade; once drawn, it could cleave through the dark curtain.\n\nAhead, there was a late-night food stall, run by a husband and wife. Business wasn't good tonight. The husband sat nearby, coughing incessantly, clearly having caught a cold.\n\nThe man walked to the stall. The proprietress looked up, saw the man, smiled, and said: “Long time no see.”\n\n“Mmm,” the man replied.\n\n“Meow,” the white cat also replied.\n\nThe proprietress began making soup, fish paste soup. She knew he only ate this. In the dead of night, having a bowl of fresh and tender fish paste soup was a pleasure. What could be better than peaceful times?\n\nThe proprietor was still coughing. Seeing the customer frown while eating, he thought the man was annoyed with him, so he could only smile apologetically and turn away. The man paused, realizing the proprietor had misunderstood. He always wore that expression while eating. It was just a little cold tonight, otherwise, when it came to eating, he would save as much as possible, ignoring it if he could.\n\nSetting down his bowl and chopsticks, and paying, the man turned and walked deeper into the old street. The white cat still followed behind him, inseparable. No matter how deep the night, people could always find their way home.\n\nThe man reached the Underworld Store's entrance and stopped. The white cat, meanwhile, darted onto the steps, finding its familiar spot. Yes, a familiar spot.\n\nOnce upon a time, his favorite thing to do was to bring out a chair and sit motionlessly on the steps, basking in the sun. The proprietress of the massage parlor next door would even tease him, saying he was like an old grandpa. His gaze shifted slightly to the next door; she hadn't returned yet. Some people, once gone, never return. But there are also those who, after traveling far, still watch over you. He had always thought he was alone, that even if he suddenly vanished from this world, no one would notice. Those who cherished solitude always liked to paint themselves with its colors to gain more security. It was precisely because someone was watching him, precisely because someone cared about him, that he came back. He needed an explanation, an explanation for those who cared about him, and at the same time, an explanation for himself.\n\nHe walked up the steps, came to the door. He didn't knock, this was his home; he had the key. The moment the key entered the keyhole, the faceless woman's long hair behind the door suddenly billowed up, the loli stood up straight like a little adult, the talismans on the foreheads of all the ghost messengers in the two rows of chairs instantly vanished, and everyone collectively opened their eyes, looking towards the door!\n\n“Creak...”\n\nThe door was pushed open from the outside.\n\nThe loli looked at the person outside the door and smiled: “Finally caught you.”\n\nThe man shook his head slightly, indicating that she was mistaken, and corrected her:\n\n“No,\n\nI,\n\nam back.”\n___\n* Footnote: \"水\" (water) here is a euphemism for the services provided by the hair salon/massage parlor, implying sex work. The humor is that the police car presence was so intimidating that the sex workers were too scared to even charge their clients.",

Sweat was already dripping from his temples, and his body was almost half-soaked.\n\nEarlier, when he first appeared, he exuded an air of immortal grace, with every gesture carrying a proper semblance of immortal aura.\n\nBut now, he resembled an elderly rock fan. He had just sung over a dozen songs continuously, all belted out with a raised voice, roaring until his voice was raw, roaring as if he might cough up blood at any moment.\n\n「Daoist Priest, we’re all on the same side, everyone here is one of us, stop singing!」\n\n「Daoist Priest, Mom asked why I’m kneeling to watch the live stream. I’m on my knees for you, please stop singing, Daoist Priest!」\n\n「Actually, I think it sounds quite good.」\n\n「Above +1!¹」\n\n「Those who don’t understand appreciation, get out of here! The Daoist Priest is using bel canto singing, combining the rhythm of classical music, and even incorporating some ethnic style... Sorry, I can’t go on inventing.」\n\n「The Daoist Priest hasn’t gone live for half a year, he probably encountered some difficulties and wants to vent.」\n\n「Victory Dawn sent an airplane: Daoist Priest, go for it, keep singing, you sing so well I’m hard.²」\n\n「Evil Shotacon sent an airplane: Daoist Priest, you go, rub your little pipe,³ 嘤嘤嘤!」\n\n「Crap, that jerk is here again, beat him to death!」\n\n「Catch him, hit him!」\n\nThe Old Daoist panted heavily, then looked at the bullet comments and chuckled, 「Next, what program do you all want to see?」\n\n「Joss paper money flying, do that trick again!」\n\n「Above +1!」\n\n「Sword dance, fist fighting!」\n\n「MCing!」\n\n「Anything but singing…\n\n  …………」\n\n「Alright, then I’ll sing another song for everyone!」\n\nThe Old Daoist cleared his throat, seemingly ready to continue singing.\n\n「…………」 Stream viewer No. 1.\n\n「…………」 Stream viewer No. 2.\n\n「…………」 Stream viewer No. 3.\n\nThe Old Daoist directly changed the song.\n\nIt was “Funeral Song” by Xiao Yiqing.\n\n「Sleep, sleep,\n\n  Please don’t wander aimlessly anymore!\n\n  Sleep, sleep,\n\n  Forget all sorrows…………」\n\n「Do you think he’s gone crazy?」\n\nTang Shi, standing beside Zhou Ze, suddenly spoke.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and calmly said, 「The person you’ve been waiting for, he’s back today, that’s why you’re happy.」\n\n「Actually, he’s just feeling unwell in his heart.」 As Tang Shi spoke, her expression gradually turned chilling. 「Do you know, the Old Daoist gave that monkey a name.」\n\n「Oh? What is it?」\n\n「Xiao Qiang.⁴」\n\nZhou Ze wouldn’t be a spoilsport and point out that it sounded very similar to the name of a certain small crawling animal.\n\n「Xiao Qiang (曉強)⁵ was the Old Daoist’s former roommate. They met in Rongcheng.」\n\n「Where is he?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Dead.」\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips.\n\n「He died helping us escape.」\n\nAt this point, Tang Shi paused, then continued:\n\n「So, this isn’t just about being happy to welcome him back.\n\n  Actually,\n\n  This is an act of revenge.\n\n  Today,\n\n  Is not a joyous day for a returning old friend,\n\n  It’s a day of revenge.\n\n  A blood debt,\n\n  Paid in blood.」\n\nTang Shi waved a finger, and the red ink on the bar counter immediately splattered out, swirling around her wrist like a blood-red bracelet, eerily captivating.\n\n「I don’t understand.」 Zhou Ze shrugged. 「Since you’ve already escaped, and someone even sacrificed for it, why would he voluntarily go back?」\n\n「Before I answer that question, can I ask you one?」\n\n「Ask away.」\n\n「Why couldn’t that temple god from last time, and the senior ghost official from Tongcheng who had problems recently, kill you?」\n\nZhou Ze didn’t know how to answer.\n\nHe couldn’t say that he wasn’t very sure himself, it was like getting drunk, sleeping, and waking up to see,\n\nOh,\n\nThe person who wanted to kill me,\n\nIs dead.\n\nHahahahaha,\n\nThat fool actually died just like that,\n\nAnd I don’t remember anything,\n\nHahahahaha!\n\nTang Shi answered for him:\n\n「Because, you’re not the only one,\n\n  Who can make progress.」\n\n「So confident, are we? Then I really have more to look forward to.」\n\nZhou Ze didn’t wish for the little loli⁶ to return safe and sound.\n\nHe wouldn’t be deceived by the little loli’s appearance. In fact, he knew that if the little loli returned safe and sound, and even completed her mission, then it would be her turn to settle accounts with him.\n\nThe ID booklet in his hand, and the key to the Gate of Hell that originally belonged to the little loli, which he controlled, might all have to be forcibly handed over.\n\nThe truth behind the driver’s death had not yet come out, but it at least showed that the little loli was not a kind-hearted person.\n\nWhat everyone wanted was nothing but profit. Living people, busy all day for profit, remained the same even after death.\n\nBefore Madam Bai completed her merits and prepared to descend to the underworld, she specifically instructed him to dispose of her corpse, Bai Yingying. She was worried that her corpse remaining in the human world might do something uncontrollable, affecting her in the underworld, so she instructed Zhou Ze to burn Bai Yingying with bamboo during the next Hanyi Festival.⁷\n\nIn many mythological stories, even the gods in heaven have their own selfish motives and ulterior plans. There’s no need to expect those ghost officials to act for the country and the people.\n\nTang Shi flipped her wrist, and the red ink spilled onto the ground, creating a terrifying effect of bleeding. Under Tang Shi’s deliberate control, it became extremely eerily terrifying, with a dripping blood effect.\n\n「One more thing, why didn’t you go back?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\nRevenge, after all, was like a rumble.\n\nYou call your people, I call my people, we pick a place, and we fight.\n\nThe little loli had called quite a few ghost officials and also brought the Faceless Woman, but on this side, it seemed only that one person was there.\n\n「I asked him if he needed me to go back. My injuries are almost healed, but he said no.」\n\n「Is he comforting you and worried you’ll fall into danger again, or does he have enough confidence?」\n\nTang Shi smiled,\n\nHer smile bloomed like a flower.\n\nZhou Ze had never seen Tang Shi like this.\n\nShe bent over,\n\nClutching her stomach,\n\nSeemingly laughing so hard her stomach hurt, crystalline tears slowly trickling from the corners of her eyes,\n\nShe choked out:\n\n「He said, ticket money isn’t money, you know.」\n\n………………\n\nInside the Underworld Shop,\n\nTwo rows of ghost officials stood. When they fully awakened, the area around the shop was immediately covered in frost, forming streaks of ice crystals.\n\nAs if, this place was an ice chamber.\n\nThe overwhelming Yin energy seemed so dense it was about to drip as water, suffocating.\n\nIf a living person accidentally entered here, they would probably fall seriously ill upon returning.\n\nGhost officials,\n\nAfter all, were also ghosts.\n\nLiang Chuan frowned.\n\nHe was a little displeased,\n\nBecause his home had been dirtied. The frost would melt into water later, which was a real pity for the shop’s top-grade mahogany furniture.\n\nThe most uncomfortable thing was that,\n\nThe people who dirtied his home,\n\nWere all uninvited guests, not guests he had personally invited.\n\n「We’ve been looking for you for a long time.」\n\nThe long-bearded man, who had been sitting next to the little loli earlier, now stood up and walked over.\n\nThe situation was set.\n\nThis arrest operation, which had taken a long time to mobilize ghost officials from various places, was finally coming to an end.\n\nAn illegal crosser who had not gained identity but escaped from the underworld back to the human world was already a deviant who needed to be killed. What’s more, this fellow actually killed people in the human world, performing the duties of an underworld judge without the judge’s identity.\n\nUtterly presumptuous,\n\nCourting death!\n\nThe Faceless Woman stood beside Liang Chuan, looking at him. She remembered several times she had almost caught him, preventing him from leaving the underworld, but each time he escaped.\n\nThis time,\n\nShe would no longer be the one filled with resentment and anger.\n\nLiang Chuan’s gaze swept across everyone, his face expressionless. Behind him, the white cat lazily wagged its tail, occasionally licking its paws to groom its fur.\n\n「I can give you a choice.」\n\nThe little loli took a step forward, standing before Liang Chuan.\n\n「Obediently let your soul leave your physical body, and we’ll take you directly back to the underworld. You originally snuck out from there; now, returning is your proper course.」\n\nThe long-bearded man pondered, 「If we are forced to act, you must understand that you absolutely cannot escape this time. If your soul returns, at most you’ll suffer some punishment and enter the animal realm. That’s better than utterly disappearing.」\n\n「Oh.」\n\nLiang Chuan responded.\n\nHe knew that,\n\nThese ghost officials wanted to save effort, hoping to subdue him without fighting. Their activities in the human world were already difficult. Unless they were willing to choose a physical body to inhabit, which also carried great risks and uncertainties, they remained very low-key in the human world and dared not make too much of a move.\n\nImmediately after, Liang Chuan looked at the Faceless Woman beside him and said,\n\n「You captured her?」\n\nThe Faceless Woman raised her head, her hair fanning out. On her flat face, a woman’s features began to emerge. She was in great pain, struggling, growling, and simultaneously roaring.\n\nShe was dead,\n\nHer soul had been taken by the Faceless Woman.\n\nLiang Chuan licked his lips,\n\nSlowly lowered his head,\n\n「That’s the second one.」\n\nThey used the lives of his friends to force him to appear,\n\nAnd they,\n\nSucceeded.\n\n「Killing living people damages our underworld merits, and we are also unwilling to do so. This is all your fault for not knowing the situation.」\n\nThe little loli continued:\n\n「If you had obediently not resisted back then, those two wouldn’t have died. And, we also know you have a few other people you’re close to.」\n\n「Is this… another threat?」\n\nLiang Chuan asked, his head lowered.\n\n「I’m just stating a fact. We are ghost officials, guardians of the order between Yin and Yang realms. You cannot resist us.」\n\n「Heh heh…………」\n\nLiang Chuan slowly raised his head,\n\nHis eyes,\n\nWere crimson red!\n\nThe little loli’s spirit suddenly trembled, and she instinctively took a defensive posture against the young man in front of her, preparing for his sudden outburst.\n\nHowever,\n\nHer body suddenly shuddered,\n\nA skeletal hand had, at that moment, pierced through her soul body. Her entire being almost froze in place. Immediately after, she turned her head in disbelief, looking behind her,\n\nThe long-bearded man,\n\nHis eyes crimson,\n\nHis face showing struggle,\n\nHe was clearly being controlled!\n\nBut,\n\nHow was that possible!\n\nIn one move,\n\nDirectly controlling one of the most senior ghost officials present!\n\nWhy was this happening?\n\nWhy was this happening?\n\nLiang Chuan raised his head,\n\nOpened his mouth,\n\nTilted his neck slightly,\n\nHis fingers began to tap in the void before him, as if playing a piano:\n\n「Shh,\n\n  This melody,\n\n  Did you hear it?\n\n  This is,\n\n  The “Funeral Song” I played for you.」\n\n---\n¹ **Above +1**: An internet slang used to express agreement with the preceding comment.\n² **Hard**: An internet slang term originating from \"石更 (shígēng),\" a deliberate misspelling of \"勃起 (bóqǐ),\" meaning \"to get an erection.\" It is used to convey extreme excitement, stimulation, or surprise.\n³ **Rub your little pipe, 嘤嘤嘤**: An extremely vulgar and provocative internet slang phrase.

    "content": "Without much preamble,\nNo tedious self-introductions,\nAnd certainly no idiotic transitions where they announced their moves back and forth;\nThis slaughter, unfolding in a netherworld shop and not belonging to the living, began abruptly in this very manner.\n\n《The Funeral Song》,\nFor whom did it toll?\n\nThe roles of prey and hunter swung back and forth. The side that had originally been so confident and assured suddenly had a misconception, that their side might not necessarily be the one to have the last laugh.\n\nThe skeletal hand, bearing cold flames, after piercing the little loli's soul, left a large hole, a burning large hole. The little loli could only retreat, her expression grim as she looked at the wounds on her soul.\n\nThey wanted to conserve a bit of energy, knowing full well that the guy who had escaped their last encirclement was not an easy character to deal with.\n\nBut they had also been deeply convinced that, with so many underworld messengers gathered for this second encirclement, and with the opponent having no choice but to walk into their trap, victory was already within their grasp.\n\nBut,\nLooking at it now,\nDid this look like victory in hand?\n\nA sense of twisting and stinging from deep within her soul continuously assailed the little loli.\n\nShe dared not move carelessly again. This cluster of flames came from the long-bearded man; it was his signature technique. And she had been attacked so suddenly, truly without any preparation.\n\nShe even worried that if she couldn't suppress this injury, she might just vanish into thin air.\n\nSouls, seemingly more ethereal and untraceable than bodies, free from the worries of birth, aging, illness, and death, but in reality, at least in this mortal world, souls were truly too fragile.\n\nYet her physical body had not come with her. Now, she felt a little regret.\n\nIf the physical body she temporarily inhabited had been here, she wouldn't have been so passive.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer mouth opened, and the little loli's tongue began to extend. This tongue stretched very, very long, beginning to try and extinguish the flames still flickering around her abdomen.\n\nHer tongue was constantly melting,\nBut it was also continuously growing longer.\nThis was a method of healing using her own vital energy. Normally, she would certainly be reluctant to do so, but at this moment, she had no other choice.\n\nBecause,\nThe tremor deep within her heart,\nWas becoming increasingly clear!\n\nFor the first time,\nShe began to consider,\nWhether she could truly leave this place alive tonight?\n\nMeanwhile, the long-bearded man was visibly struggling to resist. He was the most senior underworld messenger present, with a certain hope of vying for the qualification of an underworld constable.\n\nOne should know that in the mortal world, Underworld Judges rarely appeared, and Underworld Constables mostly operated in the Underworld. Only underworld messengers could freely traverse between the human world and hell.\n\nBut such a senior underworld messenger, in just a short time after that person opened the door,\n\nWas controlled and turned into a puppet!\n\nRewind half an hour,\nThis scene,\nWho among them would have expected?\n\nResistance, struggle, for dignity, and for his own existence,\n\nBut in the next moment, when Liang Chuan spoke, he also chimed in, perfectly synchronized, in divine unison:\n\n\"This funeral song.\"\n\"This funeral song.\"\n\"Is played for everyone.\"\n\"Is played for everyone.\"\n\"Listen, then be on your way.\"\n\"Listen, then be on your way.\"\n\nThe long-bearded man extended his shriveled arms. Both arms were almost nothing but a layer of skin loosely covering bone, and at his palms, there was just bare, stark white bone, not even that decorative layer of skin.\n\nOver all these years,\nCountless departed souls had been captured by him, sent to hell, and delivered into reincarnation, turning into his own accumulated merits for performance. Yet now, he was like a marionette, controlled by another,\n\nControlled by his original prey.\n\nYou took me as your prey?\nFine.\nThen I'll be your master.\n\nThe faceless woman let out a sharp shriek. Her long hair flew out, coiling towards Liang Chuan. She knew that if things didn't succeed tonight, she would gain nothing.\n\nLeaving hell, leaving the water pool, even with the underworld messengers' augmentation by her side, was a tremendous drain for her. If she returned with no gains, she wouldn't even be able to leave hell next time.\n\nThe water pool would become her permanent shackles, and she would even have to worry if her weakened self would be affected by the multitude of deceased souls on the Yellow Springs Road, at which point she would completely fall, merge into their group, going from one demise to another.\n\nShe refused to lose,\nAnd she could not lose.\nShe didn't want to be like before, standing in the water pool, watching these people leave while she could only roar in fury!\n\nLiang Chuan turned his head to look at the faceless woman. His deep red eyes seemed to hide two blood moons, and at the same time, two streams of blood tears flowed from his eye sockets. It was clear that he wasn't as relaxed and carefree as he appeared on the surface.\n\nHowever, the tapping of Liang Chuan's fingers became a little livelier than before.\n\nThere was no piano in front of him, so naturally no sound was produced,\n\nBut that urgent rhythm seemed to tap against the hearts of everyone present,\nStriking their heartstrings again and again!\n\nThey were underworld messengers, guardians of the order between the Yin and Yang realms. From ancient times until now, it had always been them escorting deceased souls to hell,\n\nBut today,\nSomeone was beginning to send them off to their end!\n\nThe faceless woman's facial expression twisted. She originally had no expression, but at this moment, her face began to bulge and contort unevenly. Even her long hair, imbued with special abilities, now turned into venomous snakes like those on Medusa's head, not attacking others, but biting back at herself.\n\nThe silent piano music penetrated everywhere.\nThis was a vortex; no one could escape!\n\nStrange sounds emanated from within the faceless woman's body, as if calling out something. Between them, a certain resonance formed with Liang Chuan.\n\n\"You said you wanted to become a messenger of hell.\nI,\nI grant it to you.\"\n\nThese words were not spoken for the faceless woman, but for the soul she had swallowed.\nA lone wolf, having one friend was not easy, and this time, he lost two.\n\nHe had found Xiao Qiang's soul; though it had fallen into slumber, it would awaken one day.\nYue Cheng's soul was right before his eyes; he would send her to the destination she yearned for.\n\nYou say I am an Underworld Judge,\nThen what if I become this Underworld Judge?\n\nLiang Chuan raised his hand, then slammed it down.\nThe faceless woman suddenly lifted her head, her body beginning to twist. The soul she had suppressed, deliberately not fully devouring, now, with the help of an external force, began to counterattack her.\n\nThat girl's soul, which she had originally used to threaten him, had now become a bomb hidden within her own body, seemingly capable of blowing her up.\n\nTwo different sharp shrieks and screams emanated from within the faceless woman's body. Two women were tearing at each other, fighting, devouring.\n\nLiang Chuan had provided the arena,\nSet the stage,\nThe rest,\nWas their own contest.\n\nHe had confidence in her; she was even more suited for the identity of hell than he was.\n\nThe surrounding underworld messengers naturally didn't just watch; instead, they all acted together. At this point, they no longer cared whether it would deplete their vital energy or affect their prolonged stay in the mortal world;\n\nThey knew the situation had begun to spiral out of control. Now, they had to forcefully bring everything back to the rhythm they desired.\n\nIn an instant, Soul-Slaying Rods, Soul-Suppressing Banners, Soul-Capturing Bells, and other such items howled towards Liang Chuan, but the long-bearded man, in a nearly selfless state, blocked Liang Chuan's path.\n\nHe was powerless to retaliate but stubbornly endured all the blows, his soul beginning to fracture in a short amount of time.\n\nClearly the hunter,\nYet at this moment he sacrificed himself to protect the prey,\nHe was simply more selfless than the most loyal servant!\n\nThe faceless woman knelt on the ground, continuously emitting sharp shrieks. Ordinary people couldn't hear them; the nearby neighbors continued to sleep. But the cats and dogs on the old street sensed the subtle abnormality, yet dared not stir, only curling up in their nests, trembling.\n\nThis was a struggle that living people and creatures could not participate in,\nA deadly fight between a group of grim reapers in the human world.\nThe result of this fierce battle,\nWas that the losing side,\nWouldn't even be able to remain as ghosts!\n\n\"Thud!\"\nThe black Soul-Slaying Rod pierced the long-bearded man's chest. At the same time, Liang Chuan stumbled slightly, feeling a bit dizzy, and the crimson glow in the long-bearded man's eyes had already vanished.\n\nHe lowered his head, looking at the black Soul-Slaying Rod that had already pierced his soul, and then at his spirit body, so fragmented that it seemed a gust of wind could scatter it.\n\nHis eyes were filled with disbelief:\nWhy?\nWhy had it turned out this way?\n\n\"Kill him, refine his soul!\"\nFrom afar, the little loli, still suppressing her severe injuries, shrieked:\n\"He's done for; his oil has run dry and his lamp is withered. I want him to suffer worse than death! I will personally brand his departed soul for ten years!\"\n\nStrike him while he's down,\n\nThe long-bearded man slumped to his knees on the ground.\nThe underworld messengers in front bypassed him and continued to rush towards Liang Chuan.\nThe order of the Underworld could not be defiled. If word of today's events got out, they would become the laughingstock of the Underworld, so the man before them had to be dealt with!\n\nLiang Chuan's figure swayed as he leaned against the door.\nHis fingers had already drooped weakly, and his body was long since drenched in sweat.\nHis vision, too, seemed somewhat blurred.\n\nIn a daze,\nHe saw grim-faced underworld messengers lunging at him, one after another. And he, at this moment, was so tired. What he really wanted to do was just lean against this doorframe, and keep leaning,\nWaiting for tomorrow's sun to rise,\nWaiting for the golden sunlight to scatter upon him,\nWaiting for that warm and lazy comfort to envelop him.\n\nTwo thousand kilometers away, an old Daoist priest was live-streaming, shouting encouragement for him.\nIt was just that he never used a smartphone, so he couldn't watch the live stream.\n\nA cold girl, biting her lip, was crying and laughing for him.\n\nLiang Chuan raised his head.\nHe didn't regret anything he had done, not one bit.\nBut,\nHe had people he was bound to, people he had wronged.\nOne person acts, one person bears the consequences¹ — many times, that was just a simple, beautiful fantasy.\n\nJust as the Soul-Slaying Rod was about to strike his head,\nHe raised his hand,\nLooking at the white cat below, still grooming its fur,\nAnd called out:\n\"Pu'er!\"\n\nInstantly,\nBeneath the dim streetlights,\nThe cat's shadow began to grow longer and longer,\nLonger and longer,\nGrowing until,\nIt seemed it could engulf the entire old street...\n\n————\n\nLong has no stored chapters, everyone knows this.

    "content": "A white cat, its fur like snow, like the most exquisite and purest white in this world, carrying rare agility and clarity;\n\nBut its shadow was black, a desperate black, like demonic tentacles extending from underground, continuously spreading, continuously covering,\n\nAccompanied by,\n\nCurses and despair!\n\nThe cat's eyes flickered with the exact same brilliance that Liang Chuan's eyes had previously held deep within them, that crimson depth, like swirling magma, suffocatingly oppressive!\n\nIf one looked closely,\n\nOne could faintly discern countless wailing spirits and vengeful ghosts, and mountains of piled bones within the cat's eyes.\n\nA pair of cat eyes,\n\nImprinted with the deepest and most terrifying imagery of hell,\n\nThat was purgatory,\n\nThat was Asura,\n\nThat was the place where all beings found rest and ultimate madness,\n\nIt was the origin of life,\n\nIt was the destination of everything!\n\nAnd that place,\n\nEven ordinary *guichai*¹ were not qualified to approach.\n\nBecause there, *guichai* and ordinary vengeful ghosts were not fundamentally different.\n\n\"Meow!\"\n\nThe cat's cry,\n\nResounded throughout the entire old street,\n\nDirectly making the swarming *guichai* tremble in their hearts,\n\nAt that moment, they seemed to forget that they were actually in the mortal realm; it was as if they had returned to hell, back to that dark and sunless place.\n\nIn the mortal realm,\n\nThey were mysterious existences drifting outside people's sight, found in *zhiguai*² novels and myths, no different from the ancient deities on high mountains; in fact, they were more down-to-earth, and people feared them like tigers!\n\nBut in the Underworld, in hell, they were merely the lowest-ranking civil servants.\n\nSimultaneously with the cat's cry,\n\nThe dim red in Liang Chuan's eyes gradually returned, and no blood was flowing from his eye sockets; what should have flowed had already dried, but that deep crimson still coalesced again,\n\nEven,\n\nMore intense than before!\n\nTonight's theme,\n\nWas revenge,\n\nPreviously,\n\nWas the prelude!\n\nNow,\n\nIs the true movement!\n\nMy deceased friends,\n\nI will bring your souls,\n\nTo witness everything tonight!\n\nMy blood has dried up,\n\nNow,\n\nIt's your turn to bleed…\n\nHis ten fingers trembled again, pale and slender knuckles dancing gracefully; he was playing, he was performing, in the dead of midnight, he sent forth his own notes.\n\nAll listeners,\n\nMust die!\n\nAmong the *guichai*, three more suddenly appeared with crimson eyes, then attacked their companions without hesitation.\n\nYou captured me,\n\nYou used the lives of those around me to coerce me,\n\nYou deluded yourselves into thinking you stood on the side of justice,\n\nYou were arrogant,\n\nYou looked down on an ant like me, who returned as a stowaway,\n\nYou thought yourselves high and mighty,\n\nYou thought yourselves immensely noble,\n\nYou thought your will was correct,\n\nThen today,\n\nI'd like to see,\n\nHow noble,\n\nYou can be!\n\nI want to see,\n\nWill you cry?\n\nWill you hurt?\n\nWill you panic?\n\nAre you,\n\nAfter all, just like ordinary people,\n\nAfter stripping away your glamorous facade and identity,\n\nDo you,\n\nAlso possess fear!\n\nHis ten fingers intertwined, trembling twice as fast as before; notes of death poured forth, and inside the Underworld Store, the *guichai* fell into disarray, beginning to slaughter each other.\n\nSomeone was controlled one second prior, striking their companion,\n\nBut the next second,\n\nThey broke free from control, and while confused, their recently attacked companion retaliated.\n\nOne *guichai* after another, at this moment, seemed to turn into marionettes before Liang Chuan,\n\nHe moved whichever he wanted,\n\nHe played with whichever he wanted,\n\nHe messed with whichever he wanted,\n\nToying with you,\n\nPlaying with you,\n\nWatching you slaughter each other in fear and bewilderment,\n\nThis is my,\n\nGift to you!\n\nYou said I wanted to be a *Panguan*³, committing a great taboo,\n\nThen today,\n\nAs you wished,\n\nI shall judge your life and death!\n\nIn a corner of the Underworld Store, the little loli was licking her wounds with her tongue,\n\nStaring blankly at everything,\n\nShe saw her colleagues in front of her wildly slaughtering each other, without mercy,\n\nShe saw the crimson light continuously flashing in their eyes,\n\nShe saw the man they were pursuing leaning against the doorframe,\n\nHis eyes crimson,\n\nYet a smile on his lips,\n\nEnjoying all of it!\n\nEverything, everything was so unreal, so despair-inducing,\n\nThis is a dream,\n\nThis is definitely a dream,\n\nI must be in a dream,\n\nMust be in a dream!\n\nYes,\n\nThis isn't real,\n\nThis definitely isn't real,\n\nHow could this possibly be real!\n\nIf Zhou Ze were here now, seeing the little loli completely scared senseless at this moment, he would probably feel an immense sigh of regret; the little loli, who was once the biggest threat in his eyes,\n\nWas now truly scared into a regular silly and cute loli,\n\nHuddled there,\n\nTrembling.\n\nToo bad she was a soul body, without a physical form,\n\nOtherwise, if Zhou Ze were here, he could even lift her skirt to see if she'd also wet herself from fright.\n\nOf course, in Tongcheng, over two thousand kilometers from Rongcheng, Zhou Ze was not entirely without sensation; the spot of the mark on his right palm continuously gave off a stinging pain, so unbearable that Zhou Ze could only clench his fist tightly.\n\nAlthough he wasn't sure what exactly was happening,\n\nZhou Ze had a premonition,\n\nThat the little loli, who would cause him trouble if she returned to Tongcheng, was now in great trouble; the key to the gates of hell she had left him was shifting, meaning she was gradually losing control of this key!\n\nOnce she truly couldn't return,\n\nThis key,\n\nWould be his, and… completely and utterly his!\n\nWith the ID in hand, and the key also in hand,\n\nHe would be a legitimate *guichai*!\n\n…………\n\nRongcheng,\n\nOld Street,\n\nChaotic,\n\nChaotic,\n\nCompletely chaotic,\n\nThe entire North Old Street,\n\nWas in a complete mess.\n\n\"When I descend into hell,\n\nI will walk on a path paved with white bones;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will pluck the most beautiful *Bi'an flowers*⁴;\"\n\nLooking at this frantic scene before him,\n\nLiang Chuan smiled very happily,\n\nHe softly chanted, as if he were the narrator for this mad and tragic farce,\n\nProviding the voice-over for this stage play whose scent of blood was almost thick enough to drip.\n\nHis fingertips were still dancing,\n\nThe melody was still pouring forth,\n\nNot yet finished,\n\nCannot stop yet.\n\nThe white cat was already soaked with blood, slowly staining its pure white fur red, but it stood there resolutely, by Liang Chuan's side.\n\nLiang Chuan's eye sockets were now empty of eyes, deeply sunken; his entire person had become somewhat emaciated and withered, as if a gust of wind could blow him over.\n\nBut the bloody light deep within his eye sockets,\n\nContinued to ripple,\n\nNot enough,\n\nStill not enough,\n\nReally,\n\nStill not enough!\n\n\"When I descend into hell,\n\nI will drink the murkiest water of the Yellow Springs⁵;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will traverse endless curses;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will face the void of darkness.\"\n\nThe chanting, to these *guichai*, was like a death knell, urging them to continuously push this mutual slaughter to a climax, driving them to plunge their weapons even harder into their companions' bodies.\n\nSouls were shattering,\n\nScreams were echoing,\n\nRoars were resounding,\n\nThey knew what they were doing,\n\nBut the most painful thing was precisely that they knew what they were doing!!!\n\nThey couldn't stop,\n\nThey couldn't stop at all,\n\nThey had already lost themselves, and could only complete their actions under the gaze of that man,\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nThey truly felt as if a *Panguan* was standing before them, holding a judgment brush, recounting their sins, and sending them to the execution ground!\n\nBut throughout history,\n\nOnly they, the *guichai*, escorted others to hell to be boiled in oil and then collected tribute money⁶,\n\nWhen had they themselves ever been bound and subjected to such cruel torture?\n\nThe slaughter,\n\nWas still ongoing,\n\nDespair,\n\nWas also continuously spreading.\n\n\"When I descend into hell,\n\nI will be buried in an endless sea of blood;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will dedicate myself to demons;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will indulge in solitude;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will never look back.\"\n\nThe chanting grew faster and faster, the rhythm clearer and clearer; Liang Chuan became increasingly lost in himself, immersed in a non-existent rhythm, wandering in the atmosphere he created for himself.\n\nAn ordinary person seeing this scene would think he had a problem, a madman entertaining himself,\n\nOnly,\n\nThis group of *guichai* in the Underworld Store,\n\nTruly experienced this terror and perceived this despair!\n\n\"When I descend into hell,\n\nI will no longer be lost;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will no longer hesitate;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will abandon thought;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will cast aside all chaos.\"\n\nThe faceless woman, who had been kneeling in the corner, also slowly began to chant the exact same words as Liang Chuan; she slowly stood up,\n\nShe extended her hand,\n\nPulled back her hair,\n\nShe, who was originally faceless,\n\nHer facial features were slowly protruding.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThere was no struggle,\n\nNor resistance,\n\nAmidst these chants,\n\nIt was as if many things had already settled!\n\nHer mouth, split open,\n\nRed lips appeared, a curling tongue appeared, pearly teeth appeared; her entire face became clear.\n\nThis was a captivating face,\n\nThis was a pretty face,\n\nThis was a young face.\n\nThe woman looked at Liang Chuan, chanting along with him.\n\nLiang Chuan reached out and patted the woman's head, as if stroking his own younger sister.\n\nHer dream was to become an apostle of hell; she was infatuated with it, dedicated to it,\n\nSo,\n\nHe gave her this opportunity,\n\nThis was her choice, without hesitation, without sadness, without concern.\n\nThe two exchanged glances, continuing to chant together:\n\n\"When I descend into hell,\n\nI will bury the past;\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will obscure the future,\n\nWhen I descend into hell,\n\nI will no longer exist in the world!\"\n\nAs the chanting reached this point, the white cat had already turned into a blood-colored cat;

    "content": "\"Boss, are we doing business today or not?\"\n\nBai Yingying walked over to Zhou Ze, her face full of grievance.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, took a sip of water, shook his head, and said, \"They're happy today, let them make some noise.\"\n\nAfterwards,\n\nZhou Ze then saw the joss paper on the ground and the bloody ink painting scroll Tang Shi had made. He looked at Bai Yingying with some pity and comforted her:\n\n\"Tonight, let those two be responsible for cleaning up.\"\n\n\"Mhm, okay!\"\n\nThe silly girl Bai Yingying immediately cheered up.\n\n\"Pour me another cup of coffee and get me a newspaper.\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his right palm. The pain was slowly fading, but the sense of belonging to the key of the Gate of Hell was constantly strengthening. However, this series of stimuli made him feel somewhat mentally fatigued.\n\nHe was already severely injured and had only recently awakened, his body still a bit weak, unable to withstand much exertion.\n\nBai Yingying diligently brought the coffee and newspaper, then scurried upstairs. Since the boss said they weren't open for business today, she would go back to her room upstairs to play PUBG.\n\nShe heard new gun skins had just come out, and she had already decided to pawn another one of her funerary objects to buy them.\n\nIt's a pity Bluehole didn't know of her existence,\n\notherwise, they would truly give her an award certificate—a true ashes-level player!¹\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, continued to sit by the window, flipping through the newspaper in his hand.\n\nThe wild revelry over there continued. Zhou Ze had thought no more customers would come, but one actually did.\n\nThis gave Zhou Ze a misconception:\n\nHa,\n\nthere really are people not afraid of death?\n\nIt was a regular customer, leading a Corgi. She was Zhou Ze's first client when he opened his old store; at that time, her beloved dog had gone missing, and Zhou Ze helped her find it.\n\nXu Qinglang had wanted to show off his twenty-odd apartments in front of her,\n\nbut then she said his family's resettlement housing was provided by her family's real estate company, which depressed Xu Qinglang for several days. His attempt to show off backfired spectacularly, which naturally wasn't pleasant.\n\n\"Boss, it's pretty lively here.\"\n\nThe young woman sat down in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the coffee in front of him towards her. \"Haven't drunk it.\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"I don't drink this. What's going on with them?\"\n\nThe girl pointed to Tang Shi and the Old Taoist, who were still making a racket over there.\n\n\"Oh, we just opened, so we hired a circus troupe to liven things up.\"\n\nThe girl smiled, unsure if she believed him or not. She walked over to the counter herself, poured a glass of water, then walked back and said:\n\n\"Boss, remember I told you I could invest if you opened a new store?\"\n\n\"It's a losing business; I'm afraid it would drag you down.\"\n\n\"I just happened to be passing by today, and when I saw the 'Midnight Bookstore' sign, I hesitated for a moment. It really did move here. Alright, this location is pretty good. I just came in to say hello, see you next time.\"\n\nThe girl came quickly and left just as quickly.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his coffee, took a sip, and continued reading the newspaper, only to find a dark shadow appearing by his bed.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked out the glass window. An old woman stood there, withered and with a vacant expression.\n\nHe reached out and tapped on the window glass. The other party tilted her head and looked over.\n\nStill bewildered.\n\n\"Hey, are you done?\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted towards Tang Shi and the Old Taoist.\n\nThey were nearing the end. The Old Taoist was breathless from singing, collapsing onto the ground. Tang Shi neither laughed nor cried anymore.\n\nZhou Ze gestured for Tang Shi to look outside his window. Tang Shi understood, walked out, and soon, the old woman was forcibly ushered into the store.\n\n\"Can you send her to Hell?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHe was somewhat weak now; the Gate of Hell couldn't be opened.\n\n\"The kind where her soul scatters?\"\n\nTang Shi asked.\n\n\"Forget it.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old woman and noticed her eyes were lifeless. Apart from an initial glance at people, she just numbly stared in one direction the rest of the time.\n\nFollowing her gaze, Zhou Ze found she was staring at the clock hanging on the wall.\n\nA customer had arrived,\n\nand he wasn't feeling well, so it was inconvenient to receive her,\n\nbut he couldn't just kick a customer out.\n\n\"Let's keep her in the store. Tomorrow, when my body recovers some energy, I'll see if I can open the Gate of Hell and send her down.\"\n\nEven a mosquito's leg is meat²; Zhou Ze wouldn't turn it down or let it go.\n\n\"Who's going to watch her?\"\n\nTang Shi asked.\n\nIn the bookstore, counting everyone, only four people could actually keep an eye on a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze, Xu Qinglang, Tang Shi, and Bai Yingying. The Old Taoist, being a half-measure³, didn't count.\n\nBut today, Xu Qinglang had gone back to his hometown, so he wasn't here.\n\nZhou Ze was physically weak and couldn't watch her.\n\nThat left only Tang Shi and Bai Yingying. Miss Tang's meaning was, \"You call your maid, who's playing games upstairs, down to watch the ghost. I don't have the free time to do your odd jobs.\"\n\nBut Bai Yingying had just gone up to play games; calling her back down now, Zhou Ze felt a bit reluctant.\n\nThis silly girl had even pawned her funerary objects to open a bookstore for him, usually busy with everything, inside and out,\n\nshe had to help him bathe and sleep with him,\n\nhe really felt bad depriving her of her hobby time.\n\n\"Alright then, let's just leave her here. Looks like she won't run off anyway.\" Zhou Ze could only shrug.\n\n\"Heh heh, the ghosts around here will be attracted by your presence, but they'll quickly realize what kind of place this is. Then they'll start to get scared, start to avoid it, and finally, slip away when you're not paying attention.\n\nFear of death is human nature; ghosts are no exception.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the old woman, who was still staring at the clock, and said:\n\n\"I keep feeling like there's something wrong with her mind. Do ghosts get Alzheimer's too?\"\n\n\"Haven't done research on that.\"\n\n\"Forget it. If she leaves, she leaves. If I can't send her directly to Hell, I can't just smash her to pieces today, can I? This is a delivery station, not a slaughterhouse.\"\n\n\"Do as you please.\" Tang Shi prepared to get up and go upstairs.\n\n\"Hey.\" Zhou Ze called out to her.\n\nTang Shi didn't stop, walking even faster.\n\nClearly, she knew what Zhou Ze wanted to say—something she was even more unwilling to do than watching a ghost!\n\n\"Boss, I'm so damn refreshed!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist climbed up. He had already ended his live stream, and the monkey had also put down its phone and run to the counter to look for food.\n\n\"Old Taoist, feeling good now?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Feeling good, haven't felt this good in a long time.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist was so simple and honest that Zhou Ze felt a bit reluctant.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still said, \"Clean up the place.\"\n\n\"............\" The Old Taoist.\n\nIt was unclear if it was really because Tang Shi and the Old Taoist made too much noise that night, but in any case, for the entire latter half of the night, apart from the old woman, no other customers showed up.\n\nZhou Ze leaned on the sofa, played on his phone for a bit, then looked at the newspaper. He was currently an injured person, unable to move very easily, so he could only obediently rest and recover.\n\nThe Old Taoist spent over two hours cleaning the store, then sat down in front of Zhou Ze, rubbing his lower back and groaning:\n\n\"My back, it's gonna break.\"\n\n\"Anyway, you're so old, it's fine if your back isn't good.\" Zhou Ze teased.\n\nThe Old Taoist said with a wronged expression, \"I may be old, but isn't it 'silkworms spin silk until death, candles weep tears until ash'⁴? At my age, I should help as many fallen women⁵ as I can.\n\nPeople, living in this world, need to help each other.\"\n\nZhou Ze was too lazy to entertain the Old Taoist's dirty jokes. He turned his head and twisted his neck, finding that the old woman was still standing there.\n\nThe Old Taoist couldn't see her because he hadn't rubbed ox tears⁶ on his eyes, so he didn't know there was a strange ghost standing in the store all along.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, to be honest, had just been distracted. Having experienced temple gods like Qingyi Niangniang and the big scene with that problematic ghost messenger, Zhou Ze couldn't really claim to pay much attention to these small fry now.\n\nHowever, after several hours, this old woman was still there.\n\nShe was still standing in her original spot, motionless, just staring at the wall clock.\n\nCould it be that this old lady used to be in the clock business when she was alive?\n\nBut that's not right either,\n\nZhou Ze's wall clock only cost a few hundred yuan, a cheap item, not an antique collection. Was it worth staring at for so long?\n\nAt this moment, Bai Yingying came downstairs. She had finished playing her game and looked quite happy; she must have gotten a chicken dinner.\n\n\"Boss, shall we go upstairs and sleep?\"\n\nThe silly girl was always so straightforward.\n\nThe Old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze with some envy,\n\nhe suddenly felt a bit strange. Do all male ghosts who crawl out of Hell have such luck with women?\n\nWhen his previous boss ran a ghost shop in Rongcheng, pretty women would also proactively come over every night, on time, to sleep with him. It really made him and Xiao Qiang extremely envious back then.\n\nXiao Qiang,\n\nThe Old Taoist sighed.\n\n\"Oh, there's someone else standing here.\"\n\nBai Yingying saw the old woman, walked up to her, and waved her hand. The old woman remained unmoved, continuing to stare at the clock.\n\n\"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at me! If you don't look at me, I'll eat you.\"\n\nBai Yingying poked her head out in front of the old woman, but the old woman still had no reaction.\n\n\"Boss, was it you or Miss Tang who made her silly?\"\n\n\"She's been like this ever since she came in.\"\n\nZhou Ze forced himself to stand up and walked over with Bai Yingying's support.\n\nJust then,\n\nthe hour hand pointed to the six o'clock position,\n\n\"Dong... Dong... Dong... Dong... Dong... Dong!\"\n\nThe wall clock began to chime,\n\nThe old woman, who had been staring blankly moments before, suddenly spread her arms and let out a hysterical laugh. This laugh startled Zhou Ze.\n\nNot startled by a ghost,\n\npurely the feeling of someone suddenly shouting at you from behind while you're walking down the street.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha, it's time, it's time!\n\nI can die now,\n\nI can die now,\n\nI can finally die!\"\n\nThe old woman jumped and bounced on the ground excitedly,\n\nas if she had been freed,\n\nso happy, like a seventy-something-year-old child.\n\n\"Granny, do you have a lump on your head⁷?\" Bai Yingying said, somewhat bewildered. \"You've been dead for a long time; your soul has been out for ages.\"\n\nHearing this, the old woman,\n\nsuddenly froze,\n\nher face full of disbelief as she looked around.\n\nShe must have realized this wasn't her home,\n\nthis was a strange place,\n\na strange bookstore.\n\nThe old woman pointed to her face, looking at Bai Yingying in confusion:\n\n\"I've been dead for a long time?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Bai Yingying said as if it were obvious.\n\nThe old woman suddenly collapsed onto the ground,\n\nand burst into loud sobs,\n\n\"Died too early, it's over, it's over!\n\nDied too early, died too early,\n\nit's completely over,\n\nit's totally done for⁸...\"\n\n---\n¹ **Ashes-level player (骨灰级玩家):** An idiom used to describe an extremely dedicated and obsessive player of a game, implying they would play until they turn to ash.\n² **Even a mosquito's leg is meat (蚊子腿也是肉):** An idiom meaning that even small gains are still gains; every little bit counts.\n³ **Half-measure (半桶水):** An idiom referring to someone who only has superficial knowledge or limited ability in a certain area; a dabbler.\n⁴ **Silkworms spin silk until death, candles weep tears until ash (春蠶到死絲方盡蠟炬成灰淚始干):** A famous line from a Tang Dynasty poem by Li Shangyin, often used to describe tireless dedication or devotion until the very end.\n⁵ **Fallen women (失足婦女):** A euphemism in Chinese for prostitutes.\n⁶ **Ox tears (牛眼淚):** In Chinese folklore, a mythical substance that, when rubbed on the eyes, allows one to see ghosts or spirits.\n⁷ **Do you have a lump on your head?

    "content": "\"Is she crazy?\" Bai Yingying was a bit confused.\n\nZhou Ze also shook his head. To be honest, Zhou Ze couldn't tell what was going on either. When he was a doctor, he often encountered C-sections chosen for auspicious dates and times, but he had never seen anyone who *had* to choose a specific time to die.\n\nHe estimated that when the old woman was alive and lying in her sickbed, she must have been staring at the clock at home, counting the seconds to figure out when she would pass away.\n\nLooking at the old woman's wailing and lamenting appearance, it certainly wasn't an act. She was already dead; why would she still put on an act? Who was she trying to impress?\n\nIt's just that her incessant crying was making Zhou Ze quite agitated. Old Daoist couldn't hear it, but he could. His own sleep quality wasn't good to begin with; how was he supposed to rest later when he was being bothered like this?\n\nZhou Ze didn't have the heart of a bodhisattva, and he had just eaten his own conscience not long ago.\n\nThe old woman crying there wouldn't elicit any sympathy or concern from Zhou Ze; it would only cause him annoyance.\n\n\"Scare her a bit, make her shut up.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, revealing her fangs. The zombie's aura instantly appeared, and the old woman indeed stopped crying; she was terrified.\n\nAt the same time, the old woman's lingering obsession was slowly dissipating.\n\nOrdinary wandering souls could linger in the human world simply because of a wisp of obsession. And once that obsession dissipated, they would naturally return to where they belonged.\n\nWhat ghost emissaries needed to seize and send to hell were the wandering souls whose obsessions were difficult to dissipate or who had simply turned into malevolent spirits; *these* were the actual performance metrics.\n\nIn other words,\n\nif Zhou Ze had sent the old woman away earlier, it would have counted as performance. Although it wasn't much, it was still \"meat from a mosquito's leg.\"¹\n\nBut now, the old woman could return to hell by herself. Even if Zhou Ze took the risk of his wound tearing open or fainting to open a gate to hell for the old woman, it would just be a thankless effort, sending the old woman on an express trip with the wind. In reality, he wouldn't gain any benefit at all.\n\nThe old woman's wandering soul was slowly dissipating, gradually beginning to sink into the ground.\n\n\"Boss, why is your hand shaking?\"\n\nBai Yingying, who had been supporting Zhou Ze, sensed his unusual state.\n\n\"My heart aches.\"\n\nZhou Ze uttered these two words.\n\nHe finally understood the potential consequences that the little loli had warned him about regarding keeping Bai Yingying by his side. Damn it, some ghosts were attracted to him, but then they were scared by the zombie and immediately achieved enlightenment, not even daring to fart and meekly going to hell.\n\nWhat was left for him to do then?\n\nOf course, this was something that couldn't be forcefully reversed. And today's surprise had already arrived: the key to the Gate of Hell and the news that the little loli had likely suffered a major accident were far, far more valuable than the performance points from one wandering soul.\n\nThis sleep was quite peaceful.\n\nWhen he woke up the next day, Zhou Ze found that some of his strength had returned; he wasn't as weak as he had been yesterday. Without waiting for Bai Yingying to help him, Zhou Ze propped himself up with his hands and stood.\n\nAlthough he was a bit unsteady, he had, after all, stood up.\n\n\"Boss, are you okay?\"\n\nBai Yingying was quite worried beside him, afraid that Zhou Ze would suddenly fall, especially since Zhou Ze had gestured for her not to help him down the stairs.\n\nGiven Zhou Ze's current physical condition, he was almost like an elderly grandpa or grandma with mobility issues.\n\nBai Yingying was genuinely worried that if Zhou Ze fell, he might break an arm or a leg, or even more exaggeratedly, become paralyzed; the \"retarded\" electric \"woo-woo-woo\" wheelchair Old Daoist had bought might actually come in handy.\n\nEarly in the morning, the female zombie's thoughts were a bit scattered.\n\nShe automatically started to imagine her boss sitting in an electric wheelchair, moving with a \"woo-woo-woo-woo-woo\" sound,\n\nand sucking on a pacifier.\n\nIt was truly,\n\n\"Hahahahahaha...\"\n\nAs she laughed,\n\nBai Yingying stopped. She saw Zhou Ze turn his head and look at her.\n\n\"Are you turning into a zombie?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBai Yingying shook her head.\n\n\"Zombie epilepsy?\"² Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nBai Yingying immediately shook her head again.\n\nShe also didn't dare to reveal the scene she had just secretly imagined, or her boss would definitely stab her to death once he recovered.\n\nHmm,\n\nWith his fingernails.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his maid was acting as if her wires were crossed early in the morning. He then said:\n\n\"Give me two cries, let me hear.\"\n\n\"Yingyingying.\"\n\nOh, she's back to normal.\n\nSlowly supporting himself on the stairs as he went down, Zhou Ze had a sense of accomplishment, like he was learning to walk again as a child. To be honest, Zhou Ze didn't want to experience that feeling of blacking out from alcohol again.\n\nThe pleasure was temporary, instantaneous, and then came a very long period of weakness and listlessness.\n\nJust like eating too much of \"that stuff\" and becoming a \"seven-times-a-night hero\" in bed that very night, full of vigor and swagger,\n\nonly to wake up the next day with a sore back, weak knees, and powerless legs, or even potentially suffer a sudden death.³\n\nOld Daoist was already up. No matter how late he slept, he always woke up early. He had a fixed schedule and would practice a set of punches in the morning.\n\nAs a warm-hearted Old Daoist dedicated to caring for \"fallen women,\"⁴\n\nhe clearly understood the importance of maintaining his physical health.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze came down, Old Daoist had already finished his exercises. He was huddling with the little monkey, talking.\n\nOld Daoist was holding some black mud in his hands, and there was a large bag of it on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThat was the stuff the little monkey had smeared on his wounds when he was injured. Its effect was remarkable, no less potent than the \"Black Jade Ointment for Bone Regeneration\"⁵ from wuxia novels.\n\nIt was just that the smell was a bit unpleasant, and for someone like Zhou Ze, who had a cleanliness obsession, smearing layers of mud on himself was no less than torture.\n\nBut next,\n\na scene that shocked Zhou Ze even more and felt like an intensification of the torture appeared.\n\nOld Daoist brought the plastic bag containing the mud close to the little monkey,\n\nto be precise, he held it under the little monkey's crotch,\n\nwhile making a \"shhh-shhh-shhh-shhh...\" sound.\n\n\"My little ancestor,\n\nhurry and pee!\n\nRight now, we're counting on this stuff to get rich.\n\nBe good,\n\nhurry and pee, be good, shhh-shhh-shhh-shhh...\"\n\nZhou Ze's face darkened.\n\nThe mud smeared on his body,\n\nactually,\n\nactually,\n\nactually came from this!\n\n\"Aiyo!\"\n\nBai Yingying, quick-witted and nimble-handed, caught Zhou Ze just as he was about to fall.\n\nOld Daoist heard the commotion and turned his head,\n\nand gave Zhou Ze a sunny smile comparable to the big sun outside. With one hand holding the black mud, he waved and greeted:\n\n\"Boss, good morning!\"\n\nHeaven help him,\n\nif Zhou Ze hadn't happened to be injured recently,\n\nOld Daoist would have truly died countless times by now.\n\n...\n\nFrom noon to afternoon, the bookstore generally didn't open for business. This bookstore, located in the prime real estate area of South Street's city center, was precisely this willful, precisely this \"B-ge\"!⁶\n\nHowever, if a customer came in, wanting to buy books or read and drink beverages, they wouldn't be turned away.\n\nBut previously, Xu Qinglang, in order to reduce his workload, had hung up a sign:\n\n\"Minimum consumption of 100.\"\n\nThis was enough to scare away eighty to ninety percent of potential customers.\n\nZhou Ze just let it be. With fewer idle people, everyone's workload would be a bit lighter.\n\nOf course, there were also those wealthy individuals who weren't short on cash. Just as Zhou Ze had finished his meal and was struggling with the nausea in his body, a middle-aged man with a slicked-back hairstyle and a yellow jacket walked in.\n\nHe seemed quite pleased with the quietness of the shop. After ordering a glass of ice water, he took out his laptop and sat on the sofa to work.\n\nBefore long,\n\nhis laptop seemed to have public playback on,\n\nand it rang out:\n\n\"Macau's first online casino is now online! Beautiful dealers are dealing cards live...\"\n\nOld Daoist heard the melody and understood the subtle implication.\n\nHis ears twitched, and he immediately leaned closer,\n\nas if he had found a kindred spirit.\n\nBut when he saw the interface, Old Daoist was dumbfounded. What about the promised \"Island Nation quality education action movies\"?⁷ What the hell were all these chips doing all over the screen?\n\n\"You play online gambling too?\"\n\nThe man asked, seeing Old Daoist lean in with interest.\n\nWhat kind of person was Old Daoist? He could even become sworn brothers with a monkey.\n\nOn one hand, he could trick the lovely viewers in his live stream into buying joss paper money.\n\nOn the other hand, he could trick coal bosses from Liaoning into transporting coal to Shanxi to sell.⁸\n\nHe immediately said directly:\n\n\"Play? Yeah, I play a couple of rounds occasionally. But I don't play big; it's not really interesting, not exciting.\n\nI usually prefer going to Macau to play, purely to relax.\"\n\nAs Old Daoist spoke, he even took out his pinky finger to pick his ear,\n\nlooking utterly nonchalant!\n\nAt the same time, Old Daoist also made the little monkey poke its head forward and reached out to pet it.\n\nWhat a flex,\n\nSee that?\n\nA golden snub-nosed monkey, a national protected animal, is my pet.\n\nIt's not much worse than those Arab tycoons raising leopards, right?\n\nThe man was startled at first. There was nothing he could do; he wasn't sure if what Old Daoist had bragged about earlier was true, but this golden snub-nosed monkey, that wasn't fake.\n\nAnd in the city center of South Street, opening a bookstore like this either meant you were crazy or had too much money to burn, purely playing a life game.\n\nImmediately, the man became enthusiastic towards Old Daoist. He warmly invited Old Daoist to sit beside him and gave him a detailed introduction to how his website worked.\n\nZhou Ze listened from the side, then took out his phone, wondering whether to call the police.\n\nMost online gambling in China were scams, tricking people into depositing money. They'd let you win some money first, then fatten you up like a pig to be slaughtered. In reality, these were all old tricks left over from ancestral gambling dens, but the number of people who fell for the traps was truly countless.\n\nBecause no matter how much the tricks changed, it truly didn't matter,\n\nthe key was the greed in people's hearts; it was passed down through generations and couldn't be changed.\n\nBut the ensuing conversation made Zhou Ze temporarily hold off on calling the police.\n\nBecause Old Daoist had been maintaining his \"B-ge,\"\n\ndisplaying a dismissive attitude towards common gambling methods like instant lottery or others. This made the man go all out to win over this \"crazy\" wealthy client,\n\nfinally saying directly:\n\n\"There's a truly exciting project, I just don't know if you, Boss, dare to play?\"\n\n\"Hmph, I even dare to bathe ghosts, why would I be afraid of your exciting project?\"\n\nSomeone can testify to that.\n\nOld Daoist wasn't bluffing.\n\n\"Tell me, what do you gamble on?\" Old Daoist urged.\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment, but still spoke:\n\n\"Lives!\"\n\nAt once,\n\nZhou Ze, who had been drinking coffee and listening to the conversation nearby, felt the spoon in his hand tremble slightly.\n\nIn his mind, the old woman from last night appeared, the one who stood in the shop staring fixedly at the clock, not even knowing she was already dead.\n\nAnd the fallen police officer whom he had personally sent off back then,\n\nwho had told him, before leaving, about the gambling syndicate he was investigating.\n\nThey didn't gamble on anything else,\n\nnor did they play anything else,\n\nbut rather,\n\nLives!\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"Meat from a mosquito's leg\" (蚊子腿上的肉): A Chinese idiom meaning something small but still worth having; better than nothing.\n² \"Zombie epilepsy\" (屍癲瘋): A playful, pun-like term coined by Zhou Ze, combining \"屍變\" (shībiàn, zombie transformation) and \"癲瘋\" (diānfēng, epilepsy), implying a comedic or absurd mental state for a zombie.\n³ \"Sudden death\" (馬上風): Literally \"wind on the horse,\" this is a Chinese euphemism for sudden death, often specifically during sexual intercourse due to overexertion or heart failure.\n⁴ \"Fallen women\" (失足婦女): A euphemism in Chinese for prostitutes or women who have \"gone astray\" morally, often used in a somewhat sympathetic or patronizing context.\n⁵ \"Black Jade Ointment for Bone Regeneration\" (黑玉斷續膏): A famous fictional healing ointment from Jin Yong's wuxia novel *The Return of the Condor Heroes*, known for its miraculous ability to heal broken bones and severed limbs.\n⁶ \"B-ge\" (B格): A Chinese internet slang term, short for \"裝B格\" (zhuāng B gé).

Shanxi Province is China's largest coal-producing region. Transporting coal *from* Liaoning (a northern province but not a primary coal hub) *to* Shanxi to sell would be absurd and financially nonsensical, highlighting Old Daoist's skill at deception.",

    "content": "“Betting lives?\n\n  “Like underground boxing, the kind where you sign a death waiver?”\n\n  “No, of course not that kind, Boss, I can guarantee you’ve never seen it.”\n\n  The Old Taoist became interested. He had wandered half his life and could be considered a seasoned veteran of the jianghu*. Although he wore a Taoist robe and came from a hereditary Taoist family, by his generation, what low-class activities or unorthodox practices hadn’t he seen?\n\n  Even if he hadn’t eaten pork, had he not at least seen a pig run?\n\n  “Heh, why don’t you tell me, I really don’t believe I haven’t seen it.”\n\n  The Old Taoist, with a transcendent demeanor, lifted his Taoist robe.\n\n  “Let me clarify beforehand, the minimum investment here is fifty thousand.” The man looked at the Old Taoist. “You don’t need to worry about me swindling your money.

Moreover, he was very fond of his money pouch.\n\n  “I’m interested,” Zhou Ze suddenly said.\n\n  Yes,\n\n  He was interested.\n\n  Both the old woman from last night and the good police officer he had sent to hell had, either implicitly or explicitly, mentioned the term “betting lives” to him.\n\n  Zhou Ze really wanted to see what kind of game this “betting lives” truly was.\n\n  For him, five or six departed souls had already entered hell because of this “betting lives” matter.\n\n  What,\n\n  Exactly, was this game?\n\n  The man glanced at Zhou Ze, who was sitting there looking a bit sickly.\n\n  His disdain was palpable.\n\n  He looked good, quite handsome,\n\n  But clearly, he was just a bookstore clerk.\n\n  You’re interested?\n\n  Heh,\n\n  Do you have money?\n\n  The words weren’t explicitly said,\n\n  But his expression and gaze were already very clear.\n\n  You’re just a pauper*, plain and simple. I’ve met countless people; could I be wrong?\n\n  Zhou Ze licked his lips,\n\n  Wanting to smile to ease the awkwardness,\n\n  But then suddenly felt that smiling at this moment, with Bai Yingying and the Old Taoist present, might be awkward;\n\n  Yet, this kind of moment, when he didn’t know whether to smile or not,\n\n  Was actually even more awkward…\n\n  Then,\n\n  How infuriating.\n\n  I really want to send you to hell.\n\n  How dare you make me awkward!\n\n  The Old Taoist saw that his boss’s expression was starting to turn sour, and his heart immediately sank*.\n\n  As a veteran Taoist who had served two “ghost bosses,” he had extensive experience in flattering ghosts*!\n\n  At once,\n\n  He slammed the table,\n\n  And declared bluntly:\n\n  “Damn it*, it’s just fifty thousand, a drop in the bucket*, no problem at all;\n\n  “Don’t you dare look down on people with your dog-eyes*. I’ll transfer the money to you, and I’m not afraid of you tricking me.\n\n  “Anyone who dares to trick me,\n\n  “I have a way to send them to hell!”\n\n  The Old Taoist smiled, revealing his white teeth.\n\n  “Alright, to hell it is.” The man took out his phone. “I’ll open an account for you first; you can just transfer the money in.”\n\n  The man didn’t think there was anything special about the threat of going to hell. He believed the Old Taoist was speaking in gang slang, meaning if you dare to fool me, I’ll have someone get rid of you.\n\n  Presumably, the man never dreamed that,\n\n  In this bookstore,\n\n  Sending people to hell,\n\n  Was the real revenue-generating business.\n\n  “Open two accounts. I’ll transfer a hundred thousand to you.”\n\n  The Old Taoist transferred the money without hesitation, then leaned in front of Zhou Ze, grinning obsequiously, and invited his boss to come see what this life-betting game was truly like.\n\n  He really wasn’t afraid of this guy reneging on his debt.\n\n  As the saying goes,\n\n  “King Yama is easy to see, but little devils are troublesome*.”\n\n  Of course, these words couldn’t be said to the boss, or he probably wouldn’t even know how he died.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Old Taoist didn’t yet know that in the past two days, first volunteering to scrub Zhou Ze’s back, then offering a motorized wheelchair, and then playing with mud, he had already walked on the edge of death multiple times.\n\n  “Where did you get so much money?”\n\n  Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  “My live stream resumed. I got a lot of tips yesterday,” the Old Taoist explained.\n\n  This world has problems.\n\n  It really has many problems!\n\n  Even Doctor Zhou, as calm and composed as he was, couldn’t help but fall into deep thought because of this.\n\n  His neighbor Xu Qinglang was very rich.\n\n  His maid was very rich.\n\n  His wife was very rich.\n\n  And now,\n\n  The Old Taoist he had taken in could easily pull out a hundred thousand!\n\n  Then he looked at himself, still deep in debt*.\n\n  The man was very happy to have brought in two more clients. He immediately turned his laptop towards them and began a detailed explanation of the specific gameplay, saying:\n\n  “Don’t worry, this game is absolutely thrilling. This is a truly high-end game for the wealthy, because in this game, you can bet on human lives, decide life and death.\n\n  “How about it?\n\n  “Doesn’t it feel like being a grim reaper*?”\n\n  The man, thinking he was being witty and humorous, made a joke.\n\n  Hearing this, the Old Taoist’s mouth twitched.\n\n  “Heh.” Zhou Ze.\n\n  …………\n\n  “Boss, we really should have brought Bai Yingying. It would be more convenient for her to attend to you.”\n\n  This time, the Old Taoist was very conscious, letting Zhou Ze walk forward with his cane and no longer foolishly volunteering to carry Zhou Ze on his back.\n\n  “If she came, no one would be watching the bookstore,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  “Ah, isn’t there still Miss Tang?”\n\n  “She watches the store?”\n\n  Zhou Ze looked at the Old Taoist.\n\n  The Old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n  Both shook their heads silently.\n\n  Alright,\n\n  No more words.\n\n  Everything was understood without being said*.\n\n  Imagine the scenario of Miss Tang Shi watching the store alone.\n\n  It’s estimated that if a short-tempered customer came in shouting for coffee or demanding books be hurried up,\n\n  A pen might immediately fly over and stab them into a honeycomb*.\n\n  “Boss, be careful ahead, it’s a bit bumpy.”\n\n  Zhou Ze, leaning on his cane, surveyed his surroundings.\n\n  This was a location in Tongcheng’s urban area, not very remote, but a bit far from the city center, and part of the old town. Several small clinics and hospitals were located here, along with quite a few inns.\n\n  Of course, these small hospitals didn’t look very legitimate.\n\n  There weren’t many people coming and going on the streets. If one’s nose was a bit sensitive, they could even smell disinfectant. All in all, the place gave off an uncomfortable feeling.\n\n  “The address is this way, right?” Zhou Ze said.\n\n  “Yes, it should be here.”\n\n  The two walked into the alley together. The alley was a world unto itself*, with many doors. Zhou Ze and the Old Taoist knocked on a door with the number 203 plaque.\n\n  Soon, a middle-aged man opened the door. He had a cigarette dangling from his mouth and his gaze scrutinized Zhou Ze and the Old Taoist.\n\n  “Let me see your account,” the middle-aged man said.\n\n  “Here,” the Old Taoist handed him his phone.\n\n  The other party verified it, nodded, and smiled. “You’ve already placed your bets? You bet without even coming to see?”\n\n  “That’s why we’ve come to see now,” the Old Taoist explained.\n\n  “Alright, come in.” The middle-aged man stepped aside, coughed, spit a glob of phlegm onto the ground, and then wiped his snot with the back of his hand.\n\n  Zhou Ze and the Old Taoist entered. The inside was a bit cramped, with a spring bed and many instruments beside it. It was somewhat like an intensive care unit in a hospital, though, of course, far too rudimentary compared to an actual ICU.\n\n  At the same time, two cameras were installed in the corners of the room, providing full, blind-spot-free surveillance of every corner of the room.\n\n  An old man lay there, extremely emaciated, like a mummy lying beneath a pyramid. Even his skin had turned a deep brown.\n\n  One bed,\n\n  One old man,\n\n  Profoundly illustrating an idiom—“the oil in the lamp is exhausted and the lamp is dry*.”\n\n  On the bedside table, there was half a bowl of thin gruel.\n\n  The old man squinted, opening his eyes occasionally, but paid no attention to Zhou Ze and the Old Taoist entering. He seemed to have grown accustomed to it; people probably often came in to see him like this.\n\n  They came to see him,\n\n  To see when he would die.\n\n  He was many people’s wager.\n\n  Many had already placed bets online on how long this old man could still live.\n\n  One month? Two months? Three months?\n\n  The odds changed at different intervals, just like betting on football matches.\n\n  At the same time, during this period, the old man was not allowed to receive any treatment. The instruments here were only for monitoring the old man’s physical condition. After being compiled into data sheets, they would be uploaded to the platform daily for those who had placed bets, and those about to, to view and analyze.\n\n  At the same time, those who placed bets had the right to come and observe the old man’s condition in person.\n\n  After all, “what is learned from books is ultimately shallow; to truly know, one must practice it themselves*.”\n\n  Is it absurd?\n\n  No,\n\n  It’s not absurd.\n\n  The old man was looking at the wall clock.\n\n  On the wall, visible as soon as he opened his eyes, hung an electronic clock displaying the date and time.\n\n  In him,\n\n  Zhou Ze saw a hint of the old woman’s expression from last night.\n\n  “Boss, what illness does he have?” The Old Taoist knew Zhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he should be able to tell accurately.\n\n  “Cancer, late stage,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  “Oh, a terminal illness.”\n\n  “It is a terminal illness, but with proper treatment, his life could actually be extended, or at the very least, his suffering could be reduced.”\n\n  Clearly, this old man would not receive any treatment, because the platform’s detailed rules stated that any treatment he received would constitute a breach of contract.\n\n  “Have you seen enough, gentlemen?” The man walked over, holding a bowl of instant noodles.\n\n  “Let’s go,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n  “Go?” The Old Taoist was a bit puzzled.\n\n  How could they just leave? Damn it*, save him! This is really betting lives; they’re just letting everyone watch a person die in plain sight!\n\n  “Why not leave? He himself knows what we’re here for,” Zhou Ze said, pointing at the old man.\n\n  Clearly, the old man knew he had been abandoned without treatment.\n\n  Moreover,\n\n  He understood in his heart why people like Zhou Ze and the Old Taoist came to see him every day.\n\n  Just like that old woman,\n\n  They all understood in their hearts.\n\n  In fact,\n\n  They even cooperated.\n\n  Like that old woman, she had held on, trying to survive past a certain day. This was her obsession, which led to her becoming a departed soul and walking into the bookstore, still unaware she had died.\n\n  “This…” The Old Taoist still felt a pang of conscience, but he followed his boss out nonetheless.\n\n  Reaching the doorway,\n\n  The middle-aged man, leaning against the wall and slurping his instant noodles, called out, “Hey, want to know some inside information?”\n\n  “What inside information?” the Old Taoist turned his head to ask.\n\n  The middle-aged man rubbed his fingers together.\n\n  The meaning was clear: if they wanted inside information, they’d have to spend more money.\n\n  “You can add to your bets. It’s actually not a loss,” the man kindly reminded them.\n\n  “Hey, who are you to him? Why should we trust you?” the Old Taoist retorted.\n\n  In his eyes, the man was merely a doorman, or rather, a caretaker.\n\n  “I’ve also placed a bet,” the man said, taking a sip of his noodle soup, and then jutted his chin towards the room.\n\n  He said:\n\n  “He’s my father.”\n\n---\n*   **Jianghu (江湖)**: Refers to a traditional Chinese concept of an alternative society or realm, often associated with martial arts, wanderers, and chivalry, existing outside conventional societal norms.\n*   **Swindled (被麻雀啄了眼)**: Literally \"to have one's eye pecked out by a sparrow.\" An idiom meaning to be fooled or cheated by someone seemingly insignificant or beneath one's notice.\n*   **Pauper (沒錢相)**: Literally \"no money appearance.\" Refers to someone who looks poor or gives the impression of being financially struggling.\n*   **Sank (咯噔)**: An onomatopoeic word often used to describe a sudden, unsettling thud or jolt, or a sudden realization of dismay, often translated as one's heart sinking or skipping a beat.\n*   **Flattering ghosts (拍鬼屁)**: An adaptation of the Chinese idiom \"拍馬屁\" (pāi mǎ pì), literally \"to pat a horse's arse,\" meaning to flatter someone.

    "content": "Initial subscriptions reached 20,000,\n\nThis is Long's best result since he started writing.\n\nThank you all for your support!\n\nFor a niche supernatural novel to achieve this result, Long is already proud enough.\n\nOur initial subscriptions have already refreshed the original highest record for initial subscriptions in the supernatural genre by five times.\n\nFive times!\n\nHere, I want to thank the senior fellow authors who encouraged me back then: thank Brother Bu Zheng, Brother Zhou Zi, Brother Xiao Qi, Brother Nai Qi, Mother Xuan Shui, and other brothers. When Long was most lost, they either comforted Long or actively gave chapter recommendations.\n\nIn fact, many of these senior authors and brothers who specifically came to encourage Long were people Long didn't know, wasn't familiar with, and hadn't contacted before.\n\nTherefore, it's easy to add flowers to embroidery*, but Little Long can't forget the kindness of sending charcoal in the snow*.\n\nI also want to thank the supernatural genre's chief editor, Brother Yi Suo, and editors Sister Zhu Sha and Brother Zi Liang.\n\nI still remember, the last time I stumbled, it was before the Chinese New Year.\n\nOriginally, it was agreed with the supernatural genre editors that the new book would be published after the Chinese New Year, but Long arbitrarily changed his decision.\n\nWith no book in hand, my heart felt panicked, as if life had lost its purpose. I couldn't just browse the book review section aimlessly, couldn't look at the chapter comments. I felt very lost and uneasy.\n\nThen Long called the editor and said, \"I want to publish the book.\"\n\nAt that time, the editors were already at the airport, preparing to go home for their New Year holiday. They called to help Long make new arrangements, almost delaying their travel plans. In the end, Long was able to publish the book before the New Year.\n\nAt that time, Long made a commitment: \"Let me publish the book. I can't guarantee anything else, but the one thing I can guarantee is that no matter how unpopular the supernatural category was before, I can ensure my new book's initial subscriptions will reach 10,000!\"\n\nAs a \"dead fat otaku\"*, the \"Fat Long\" in readers' mouths,\n\nHonestly,\n\nThis fat guy, honestly, has no other special skills except being able to write books and stories.\n\nThank you to my old readers for your continuous companionship, and thank you to my new readers for joining and supporting me.\n\nTwo months ago, I stumbled once. This time, Long has climbed back up, and the height he stands at is twice as high as last time.\n\nThis is everyone's great affection for Long.\n\nLong can only repay everyone with better stories.\n\nMany people have asked Long if he will compete for the monthly ticket rankings.\n\nTo be honest, Long can't compete anymore. Since the later stages of *Horror Broadcast*^1, Long's spirit has been very fatigued, and his body has also subtly started showing some problems. Furthermore, in the past few months, there have been many issues and twists. Two new book launch periods are no less demanding than two Gaokao^2 exams.\n\nAfter dealing with the matters of going premium in the past few days, Long still needs to go to the hospital.\n\nI'm tired, truly a bit tired. During the new book period for *Midnight Bookshop*^3, Long experienced back pain while sitting in his chair and sudden nosebleeds more than once.\n\nThis body, after all, isn't made of iron.\n\nHowever, what I thought at the time was, even if I died and lay in a coffin, I would still forcefully knock on the coffin lid a few times and shout:\n\n\"Tell me the initial subscription results after going premium, otherwise I won't be able to rest in peace!\"\n\nFor the two chapters before going premium, some readers might have felt the style was a bit different from before. In fact, that was Long's own catharsis.\n\nI held my breath for two months, and in that moment, Long vented and released it.\n\nIf I didn't vent it, it would have been unbearable!\n\nLong also knows that many old readers, just like Long, also need to vent a bit.\n\nSaying all this isn't to play for pity, or to gain more momentum for competing in the monthly ticket rankings.\n\nWhat Long wants to say is, regarding the monthly ticket rankings, Long doesn't plan to compete anymore.\n\nThe time when Long truly made the greatest progress was during the writing of *Horror Broadcast*. Every day, I fully concentrated on writing good chapters and then publishing them. For an entire year, I didn't compete on any rankings, nor did I send out single chapter announcements^4. I simply focused on how to write stories and how to improve my writing level, and then I wrote Uncle Fugui^5.\n\nI also wrote \"Life and death are determined by fate, wealth and honor depend on Heaven\"^6.\n\nIn fact, sometimes Long even hesitates to post words at the end of chapters, afraid of affecting everyone's reading experience.\n\n*Midnight Bookshop*,\n\nThe book title has already set the tone for this book.\n\nThis is a bookshop that opens late at night.\n\nIt's about stories that unfold in the quiet of the deep night.\n\n\"Listen casually, as I heard\"^7.\n\nThe stories told in the book are also things Long has heard through hearsay. I'm just telling them to everyone in a different way. You shouldn't take them seriously; just listen casually, treat it as a pastime, a way to relieve boredom.\n\nSo, let's try not to break this atmosphere.\n\nLong also isn't willing to compete for rankings, letting his mindset become unbalanced, or sacrificing the pace and quality of the story for burst updates^8.\n\nAs for monthly tickets, I'll still ask for them when I should. If you have monthly tickets, just cast them for Long. For instance, we are determined to secure the first place on this month's \"New Book\" monthly ticket ranking.\n\nAs for other things, like competing for the overall rankings, let's leave it to everyone's spontaneity. If you have a ticket, just cast it for Long. If you enjoy reading it, feel free to give a reward.\n\nA single fen or a single yuan is also love^9.\n\nA Helmsman or Alliance Leader^10 is also a kind gesture.\n\nOf course, the more, the better.\n\nAfterwards,\n\nLong plans to shut himself away, ignoring everything and everyone, just peacefully writing stories. And everyone can just peacefully read them.\n\nMay the years be peaceful and good.\n\nMay the bookshop's performance get better and better.\n\nFinally,\n\nI wish everyone good health.\n___\n*   錦上添花 (jǐn shàng tiān huā): Literally \"to add flowers to embroidery\"; an idiom meaning \"to make something even better,\" often implying support given when it's easy or when someone is already successful.

    "content": "\"He's my dad.\"\n\nThis light sentence, however, seemed to have an astounding effect.\n\nThe middle-aged man took out a cigarette from his pocket, bit on one himself, and offered one each to Zhou Ze and the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist remained motionless, stunned.\n\nZhou Ze, however, calmly took the cigarette and lit it.\n\n\"So, have you thought about it?\" the middle-aged man continued to persuade. \"Don't worry, I won't trick you. I can show you my betting slips, and then you just bet on the same time as me.\"\n\n\"You truly are a good son.\"\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring and said.\n\nThe middle-aged man frowned slightly, then sneered. \"Are you making this deal or not? Speak up.\"\n\nHe wasn't stupid; of course, he could hear the sarcasm in Zhou Ze's words.\n\n\"Follow it, why not follow it?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright, five thousand. Not expensive, is it? You've already put down one hundred thousand, two slips, one hundred thousand. Another five thousand will guarantee you a profit.\"\n\nWhen money was mentioned, the middle-aged man grew excited, completely unbothered by Zhou Ze's previous mockery.\n\n\"What if your dad doesn't make it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"How could that happen? He's my dad, and he knows I've placed a bet too. Don't worry, I'll cheer him on, make him hold on stubbornly. Even if he dies, he'll die after we've gotten something out of it.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man wore an expression that suggested everything was under control.\n\nAt this moment, it truly seemed as if father and son were of one heart, a profound paternal affection permeating the air, making one deeply moved and sigh with emotion.\n\n\"When a person dies, no one can say for sure,\" Zhou Ze reminded him. \"Even Ghost Messengers can't be certain.\"\n\nGhost Messengers aren't supposed to casually take the lives of the living. Of course, it's not impossible, but the price is too great; a single slip-up could lead to eternal damnation.\n\n\"Heh heh, go on, let the Ghost Messengers snatch my dad away right now if you've got the guts!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man spat out a gob of thick phlegm, then pulled out his phone.\n\n\"Just transfer the money to me. Once it's transferred, I'll show you my slips right away.\"\n\n\"This poor Taoist will transfer you a stinking beating!\"¹\n\nThe old Taoist directly balled his fist and smashed it into the man's forehead.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was instantly stunned by the punch and fell to the ground. He tried to get up and resist, but the old Taoist stared at him with eyes wide like an ox.\n\nHe cowered.\n\nYou really couldn't expect a man who relied on his dad's life to get rich to have much backbone or vigor.\n\n\"Just you wait, you hit me, didn't you? I'm calling the police!\"\n\nThe man immediately reached for his phone, which had fallen to the ground.\n\n\"Go ahead, report it. We'll wait.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nThe man's eyelid twitched. He didn't dare call the police, truly didn't. At that moment, he picked up his phone, glared fiercely at the old Taoist, then walked into the house, shut the door, and locked it from the inside.\n\nThe old Taoist let out a long sigh, turned around somewhat dejectedly, and looked at Zhou Ze, saying:\n\n\"Boss, I'm sorry, this poor Taoist acted impulsively.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\" Zhou Ze was indifferent, asking, \"Why did you suddenly get so agitated?\"\n\n\"This poor Taoist's biggest regret in life is that when my dad was dying, I was away and couldn't make it back in time to see him one last time.\n\nThat little imp's words truly disgusted this poor Taoist. He's a complete beast, his conscience eaten by dogs, using his own dad's life to make money.\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette and said nothing.\n\n\"Boss, don't you feel anything else?\" the old Taoist asked, pursing his lips. \"Anyone would be disgusted by a beast like that, wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"I'm an orphan.\"\n\n\"............\" The old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, exhaled a smoke ring, and said, \"Actually, I've seen many similar things in hospitals. At first, I couldn't understand it either,\n\nand even felt very angry.\n\n'There are no filial sons before a long illness.' Of course, there are indeed many unfilial children, but most people actually want to cure their family members.\n\nAlthough national medical insurance and rural social security are becoming widespread, and medical conditions are improving year by year, if someone truly contracts a terminal or severe illness, it's like throwing money into a bottomless pit.\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed his cigarette butt away, making a 'throwing' motion.\n\n\"Human lives are more important than money.\" The old Taoist still insisted on his view.\n\n\"Human lives are indeed more important than money, and 'life is priceless' is indeed a slogan familiar to everyone, but the value of anything can actually be measured; it simply depends on one's perspective.\n\nFor instance, to treat a gravely ill elder, an entire family might go into debt, leaving what was originally an ordinary family completely destitute. Then, the elder's illness might still not be cured, and they pass away anyway.\n\nAnd how should the life of that family, the education and future of the children, then be managed?\n\nI once encountered a situation where an elderly man secretly ran away from the hospital. We found him. His son was very filial, willing to sell everything he possessed to treat his father's illness, kneeling and begging him to return to the hospital for continued treatment.\n\nBut he didn't want to burden his son. He said either let him go home and wait to die, or he would rush into the road and let a car hit him. In short, he didn't want to stay in the hospital and spend money, burdening his son.\"\n\nHearing this, the old Taoist pursed his lips.\n\n\"This is the helplessness of life. This helplessness runs through history, regardless of East or West. People always have to face certain trade-offs, and sometimes these trade-offs are indeed very cruel.\"\n\nThe old Taoist smiled bitterly. \"So, are we still calling the police?\"\n\n\"Yes, why not?\" Zhou Ze looked at the old Taoist. \"Life can sometimes be helpless, but life should not be desecrated.\n\nIt can wither in helplessness, but it should not be churned in a septic tank.\n\nGambling with human lives, treating the lives of their fellow beings like cockfights, cricket fights, or dog fights, seeking amusement and thrills — these people deserve to go to hell.\n\nWhen we go back, I'll give you some spirit money. You can burn it.\"\n\nHearing this, the old Taoist subconsciously rubbed his hands together, then said coyly:\n\n\"How could I possibly accept that, Boss? It's only right for me to work for you. It's just one hundred thousand yuan, right? What's the big deal? Am I really such a petty person?\"\n\nImmediately after, as if afraid Zhou Ze would go back on his word, the old Taoist quickly continued:\n\n\"Boss, if you absolutely insist on giving it, I wouldn't want to disregard your kindness.\"\n\n\"You're overthinking it. Burning spirit money is to get you some hidden virtue, and then you can surrender yourself as a tainted witness when reporting the crime. You also participated in the gambling, but it's estimated that your merits and demerits will cancel each other out, and with the effect of the spirit money, you'll be fine.\"\n\n\"............\" The old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze walked forward, leaning on his cane, while the old Taoist followed behind him, dejected, probably grumbling inwardly.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped.\n\n\"Boss, tired?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n'My boss torments me a thousand times, yet I treat him like my first love.'\n\nThe old Taoist was very clear on the basic principle of serving a ghost; otherwise, it might turn him into one too.\n\n\"Something's wrong. What time is it now?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Four-thirty PM,\" the old Taoist said, glancing at his phone.\n\n\"Why has the sky gotten so gloomy?\" Zhou Ze asked, pointing above his head.\n\n\"It's going to rain, probably,\" the old Taoist guessed.\n\n\"But the weather forecast said no rain today,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The weather forecast predicted an eighty percent chance of rain tomorrow. Their station probably only has ten people, and if eight of them raise their hands and think it'll rain, then it's an eighty percent chance.\"\n\n\"Then, what about over there?\" Zhou Ze pointed towards the distant sky.\n\nThe old Taoist looked over and was instantly stunned. There, the sky was completely cloudless, and the sun was just right.\n\nThis eerie and clear distinction was truly startling. One must remember this wasn't Yunnan or a plateau; this was the Yangtze River Delta plain region, where such a scene of sun in the east and rain in the west was very rare.\n\n\"Something's wrong,\" Zhou Ze said. Then he looked at a large gate to his right, with a sign that read \"Xinrui Hospital\" hanging above it. Inside the gate was a large clock.\n\nIt was a large decorative clock, quite massive in size.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the gate open and walked inside, with the old Taoist following behind him.\n\n\"Hey, what are you doing?\"\n\nAt this moment, the hospital security guard approached.\n\nThis hospital was actually very small, probably without much of a license. All departments, including the inpatient ward, were in a single three-story building. There was only one security guard, and he wasn't an old man, but a man with a tough-looking face, despite wearing a security uniform.\n\n\"Just taking a look,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What's there to see?\" the security guard barked.\n\n\"Hey, are you out of your mind? A hospital is open, but you won't let people in, is that it?\" The old Taoist retorted directly.\n\n'Have you ever heard of a fox borrowing a tiger's prestige?'\n\nThis poor Taoist is a dog emboldened by a ghost's power.\n\nI'll scare you to death!\n\nWait, something seems off?\n\n\"This isn't a place for seeing doctors. If you need medical attention, go somewhere else. Also, this is private property, not open for visitors, so go, go, go...\"\n\nThe security guard completely ignored the old Taoist and stepped forward, ready to drive them away.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the large clock placed at the entrance of the hospital lobby, lost in silent thought.\n\nThe old Taoist stepped forward, making direct physical contact with the security guard, colliding with him.\n\nMy boss is doing something very important... er, he's zoning out, but you still can't disturb him!\n\n\"So you want to fight, do you?\" the security guard said, pointing a finger at the old Taoist.\n\n\"Come on, try it!\" The old Taoist retorted just as forcefully.\n\nWhen it came to martial arts, the old Taoist truly wasn't intimidated!\n\n\"Do you know what this hospital does?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at the large clock.\n\n\"None of your damn business! This is just a crematorium, and it's got nothing to do with you. If you know what's good for you, scram. If you lost money gambling, don't come here looking for trouble; go find the bookie!\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nIt seemed he knew.\n\nThen Zhou Ze reached out and patted the old Taoist's shoulder.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\n\"Boss, why are you so cowardly today... Phew, what a relief, haha, no fighting, good, no fighting, good. Harmony brings wealth, harmony brings wealth.\"\n\nThe old Taoist gave an awkward laugh, then followed Zhou Ze out.\n\nThe security guard glanced at the two men walking out and snorted through his nose.\n\nWalking onto the street outside the gate, Zhou Ze lit another cigarette.\n\nThe old Taoist looked a bit deflated.\n\nHe felt that this boss wasn't as morale-boosting to follow as the previous one. If it had been the previous boss, when that jerk said \"he's my dad,\" the former boss probably would have immediately made his dad bury his own son.\n\nThis current boss, however, was too rule-abiding and self-disciplined.\n\n\"He's alive; he's not under my jurisdiction,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Hm,\" the old Taoist responded feebly.\n\n\"Old Taoist, I really don't like this place.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\n\"This poor Taoist doesn't like it either,\" the old Taoist echoed.\n\n\"What time is it?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"Four forty-three.\"\n\nZhou Ze, with a cigarette between his fingers, nodded and said:\n\n\"It's about to come out.\"\n\n............\n\nThe security guard picked up his walkie-talkie. \"Hello, surveillance room? The two people who just came in, I've chased them away. They don't seem like they lost money gambling and came to cause trouble.\"\n\nJust as he finished speaking, dense static suddenly crackled from the walkie-talkie.\n\n\"Hello? Hello?\" The security guard tapped the walkie-talkie. \"What a broken piece of junk.\"\n\n\"Dong... dong...\"\n\nThe large clock beside him began to chime.\n\nThe security guard subconsciously turned his head, then frowned, and scratched his head as he leaned in a bit closer. \"Damn it, it's not on the hour, why are you chiming?\"\n\nFour forty-three... and four.\n\nJust then, the security guard suddenly saw the sound of gears grinding coming from inside the large clock. The sound was loud and terrifying.\n\nIt also had a quality of liquid being crushed and splattering, like a large piece of pork being blended in a mixer.\n\nThe security guard was completely bewildered and subconsciously took a step back.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nhe saw from inside the large clock,\n\na hand slowly extended.\n\nThis hand appeared to have just been crushed by gears, completely mangled and bloody, with a layer of dense, tiny holes on it.\n\nMaggots peeked out from the tiny holes.\n\nThis sight,\n\nwas absolutely a nightmare for anyone with trypophobia.\n\nThe temperature around him,\n\nsuddenly dropped,\n\ngiving him the illusion of falling into an ice cellar.\n\nThe security guard's body began to tremble with fright. He wanted to run, he wanted to scream, but his legs felt as if they were filled with lead, utterly unable to move.\n\nThe hand slowly grasped the security guard's neck.\n\nA terrifying force emanated from the arm, pulling the security guard closer to the large clock.\n\nThe security guard's face was pressed against the outer wall of the large clock, his features almost deforming.\n\nAn eerie, trembling voice came from the walkie-talkie:\n\n\"What... time... is it... I... I... should I die... should I die... yet?\"\n___\n¹ The original phrase is a very vulgar Cantonese curse, \"轉你碼臭嗨 (zhuǎn nǐ mǎ chòu hāi),\" which is a highly aggressive and dismissive refusal.

    "content": "Tick... tock... tick... tock...\n\nThe hour hand moved.\n\nFew would pay attention to such subtle changes. People always said to cherish time, shouting that \"an inch of time is an inch of gold,\" but truly, very few ever accomplished it.\n\nYet many had experienced this feeling: suddenly, you quieted down, heard the \"tick-tock\" of the hands, and could clearly perceive time quietly slipping away, and along with it, your life.\n\nThis was a quiet terrifying to ponder, a quiet that gave one goosebumps. In the unseen world, it felt as if there truly was a Death Ledger, on which everyone's life and death had already been written.\n\nPeople lived merely to complete this process.\n\nAccording to the Death Ledger, they were born.\n\nAnd according to the Death Ledger, they died.\n\nThis was the great terror hidden within time.\n\nIn the basement of the Unlicensed Hospital, the space wasn't large, but it was divided into small rooms, each containing a bed.\n\nSome beds had people lying on them.\n\nSome beds had previously had people lying on them.\n\nSome beds were waiting for the next person to lie down.\n\nThis was not hell, yet it inherently carried the Grim Reaper's breath.\n\nAround, some doctors and nurses moved continuously, but here, in this hospital, they were not the \"angels in white\" people imagined, saving lives and tending to the wounded.\n\nThey simply observed, recorded, noting down each target's data, then synchronously uploading it online.\n\nIt was like playing football betting: the odds constantly changed. A main player on a team suddenly gets injured, the head coach is suddenly replaced—all sorts of on-field and off-field factors cause the odds to shift.\n\nHere, it was the same. Each person's vital signs data would make gamblers, sitting in front of computer screens, excitedly scrutinize the readings.\n\nThey probably wouldn't read their own parents' medical records as diligently as this.\n\nFrom the real-time surveillance videos, from between the lines of various data, they sought their judgments, throwing out their chips.\n\nThis was a life-gambling game. What the gamblers gained here was not just the returns on their odds, but also the thrill of controlling life.\n\nAnd this thrill was built upon trampling the lives of their own kind.\n\nA woman who had been lying on a bed suddenly struggled to sit up. At that moment, it was precisely the shift change time for the nearby doctors and nurses, and the staff in the monitoring room might have been slacking off, as no alert was issued regarding the woman's abnormal movement.\n\nThe woman pulled out the tubes from her body. She struggled to get out of bed, but tumbled directly onto the floor.\n\nShe was much younger than the others on the beds, appearing to be only thirty or forty, but her body was clearly severely swollen. Her calves were impossibly thick, almost swollen into a single mass.\n\nShe couldn't stand. Each day, even her food was rationed by quantity and type, with no excess whatsoever, all for the sake of fairness.\n\nThe fairness people pursued was most thoroughly implemented and adhered to in this regard.\n\nShe crawled.\n\nShe struggled to crawl.\n\nShe crawled to the door. The door was ajar. She pushed it open with effort and continued crawling out. She was like Sadako crawling out of a television, in white clothes, with disheveled hair, but she was still alive.\n\nOf course, she wouldn't live much longer. The candle of her life was already flickering, about to die out.\n\nShe was lucky. She crawled out of the narrow patient room, into the corridor, and to the office door. Along the way, no one passed by, and no one discovered her.\n\nHer hand rested on the office door. She wanted to ask the doctor inside to let her make a phone call.\n\nThere was an electronic clock in her patient room, showing the date and time.\n\nToday was her son's fifth birthday.\n\nShe wanted to remind her husband to celebrate their son's birthday.\n\nThinking of her son, a smile touched her lips. Her son was her deepest bond. After ten months of pregnancy, what normal mother wouldn't love her child?\n\nShe had this illness, incurable. Their family was already struggling, and her husband was addicted to gambling and jobless. Previously, the family relied on her working outside. Now, she had contracted this disease that even modern medicine was powerless against.\n\nShe couldn't bear to squander their already meager family savings on treating herself. Her son was about to start kindergarten, then school. Now, and in the future, they would all need money.\n\nHer husband knelt before her, begging her to come here.\n\nShe knew what kind of place this was. She knew what those two cameras in the patient room were for.\n\nShe agreed. She consented.\n\nDying at home was death, dying here was also death. She knew she had become a chip, but at least, by being this chip, the platform would give her family a large sum of money.\n\nThe family needed money, and her child needed money to grow up.\n\nHer husband knelt before her, promising to turn over a new leaf, be a good man, a good father, and raise their son well.\n\nShe knew she was dying soon.\n\nShe had been staring at the timetable.\n\nShe wanted to hold on.\n\nTo hold on and remind her husband to celebrate their son's birthday. She wanted to last until this day.\n\nThis was why she had been lying in bed, unable to receive any treatment, not even pain medication, enduring the torment of her illness daily yet still holding onto her last breath without dying.\n\nShe pushed the door.\n\nIt wouldn't budge.\n\nShe was already very tired.\n\nShe had little strength left in her body.\n\nInside the office, sounds of an argument erupted.\n\nThe voices of the two arguing parties were very familiar. One was her primary doctor who checked on her three times a day—morning, noon, and night—and the other was her husband.\n\nShe smiled.\n\nHer husband was actually here.\n\nThen she could tell him about their son's birthday in person.\n\nShe could also ask her husband to pass on a few words to her son; as a mother, she would be in heaven, always accompanying her child as he grew up.\n\n\"Why isn't she dead yet? Why isn't she dead!\" her husband roared.\n\n\"How would I know? Your own wife isn't dying, and you blame us?\" That was the doctor's voice.\n\n\"But I bet 200,000 on her dying last week! I thought she wouldn't live past last week!\"\n\n\"Your wife has astonishing vitality. She's practically a medical miracle. She's been off medication for so long; an ordinary person would have given up ages ago.\"\n\n\"It was you! You told me she would die last week! That's why I dared to bet 200,000! 200,000, that's a lot!\"\n\n\"Let go! Let go of me! Are you crazy? I'm not King Yama; I can't control who lives and who dies.\"\n\n\"You can't control it, yet you leaked this information to me and took kickbacks from me! You deliberately harmed me! Do you know, this 200,000 was money my wife earned with her life!\"\n\n\"If you keep this up, I'll call security.\"\n\n\"Please, help me! I'll bet another 100,000. Can you make her die this week? Please? Just secretly give her an injection, make her die this week, then I can break even and even make a profit!\"\n\n\"Another 100,000? Where did you get another 100,000 from?\"\n\n\"I sold my son! 100,000 yuan! When I turn this around and break even, I'll redeem my son. Doctor, please help me, secretly kill her. Otherwise, I'll lose both my wife and my son!\"\n\n\"Heh, you're truly something else. I'm sorry, but there are rules here, and surveillance cameras. I won't do such a thing.\"\n\n\"Then what do I do? What do I do? Oh, right, Doctor, let me see her! Let me see her once! Which room is she in? I'll go see her, I'll make her die, this week! She'll understand! If she doesn't die, our son won't be redeemed, and all our family's money will be gone. She loves me very much, and she loves her son. Just let me see her once, she'll definitely be willing to die for our son. Doctor, I beg you. Doctor, I beg you, Doctor.\"\n\n\"That doesn't meet requirements. We're not like those shady operations outside; we're very legitimate. And because we're legitimate, we get the most clients placing bets here.\"\n\n\"Here, take this, take it. When you check on her, help me pass a message. And you can place a bet too. Trust me, she'll die. She's willing.\"\n\nThe voices of the two men continued.\n\nOutside the door, the woman.\n\nHad already stopped breathing.\n\nBut her eyes,\n\nWere wide open.\n\nOn the closed door,\n\nThere were still scratches, marks from fingernails.\n\n………………\n\nOutside the hospital, Zhou Ze and Old Dao stood there.\n\n\"Old Dao, do you have any more of those talismans?\"\n\n\"None left, family heirloom. All gone. Last time at the bookstore, I used the last two while patting hair.\"*\n\nOld Dao said earnestly, \"If I still had any, I'd definitely give them to you, Boss.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nOld Dao let out a long sigh, then unconsciously reached down to touch his crotch.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nHis crotch suddenly felt hot.\n\nSo hot that Old Dao instantly jumped up, quickly reaching in and pulling out a scorching red talisman.\n\n\"Whoa whoa whoa... Hiss hiss hiss... So hot, so hot.\"\n\nWhile patting his crotch, Old Dao saw Zhou Ze looking at him, and immediately said:\n\n\"Hahahahaha, Boss, isn't it amazing? I actually forgot I still had one in my crotch. This is the last one, truly the last one.\"\n\n\"I wasn't planning to ask you for one,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I was going to remind you that a very powerful vengeful ghost will be returning on its seventh day tonight, and its resentment might be quite strong. If your talisman were still hidden in your crotch, it might hurt a lot.\"\n\nOld Dao's face immediately twisted into an old, puckered grimace.**\n\n\"Boss, why didn't you say so sooner?\"\n\n\"You said you didn't have any left, so I believed you.\"\n\n\"…………\" Old Dao.\n\nContinuously rubbing his crotch to dissipate the burning sensation, Old Dao looked at the hospital ahead. The light inside seemed much dimmer. Even though Old Dao wasn't very skilled in Taoist magic, he could sense that something had happened inside the hospital.\n\n\"Old Dao, what's your take?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nOld Dao was startled for a moment.\n\nWhat do you mean, my take?\n\nAre you a ghost or am I a ghost?\n\nAre you a ghost messenger or am I a ghost messenger?\n\nIt's haunted in there, and you're asking me my take.\n\nWhat kind of nonsense question is that!\n\nBut Old Dao immediately replied seriously and solemnly:\n\n\"Boss, there must be something fishy going on here!\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nOld Dao felt somewhat confused.\n\nA moment later, seeing that Zhou Ze had no intention of entering, he said, \"Boss, these scumbags, they're definitely scumbags, not worth helping.\"\n\nOld Dao was worried Zhou Ze would just walk in and capture the ghost.\n\nHe knew Zhou Ze's character; he strictly adhered to rules, completely different from his previous boss.\n\n\"We went in, but the security guards inside kicked us out,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"This vengeful ghost's return on the seventh day has immense resentment, so it's very unusual. Moreover, in this place, every so often, someone dies while staring at the clock, layer upon layer of resentment, constantly accumulating, and finally all falling onto this ghost. That's why, when she returned on her seventh day, her presence was so overwhelming. She even has the ability to harm ordinary people.\"\n\n\"That fierce?\" Old Dao smacked his lips. Why did he feel a little excited?\n\nIt would be best if these human scum and bastards died. They deserved it!\n\n\"Actually, she wouldn't have become so exaggerated all at once,\" Zhou Ze added.\n\n\"Then what happened?\" Old Dao looked around. \"Is there some mysterious person nearby instigating this?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nOld Dao's eyes immediately widened, and he said in a deep voice, \"Can we find them, Boss?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Then what do we do? What if that guy has ill intentions and other motives?\" Old Dao was a little anxious.\n\n\"That person probably severed the bond between the large clock and that female ghost. It's equivalent to opening the cage that imprisoned the female ghost; this is a case of a vengeful ghost being released. If that security guard hadn't stopped me, I could have prevented this. Sigh.\"\n\n\"No, don't...\" Old Dao started to say, then awkwardly chuckled, \"Boss, how about I go in with you right now?\"\n\nThe boss wanted to catch ghosts for performance, so Old Dao could only choose to follow.\n\n\"No, the security guard was too fierce, and too strong. The two of us, one old man and one disabled, can't beat him.\"\n\n\"I can...\" Old Dao was about to volunteer, thinking that security guard, with his fierce-looking face, he could deal with him, and who knew what the ghost inside had done to him.\n\nBut a scene suddenly flashed in Old Dao's mind.\n\nThe boss had just said someone severed the bond between the female ghost and the large clock, releasing the vengeful ghost.\n\nOld Dao remembered that when he and the security guard were bickering,\n\nThe boss, standing behind him in front of the large clock, seemed to have fiddled with the large clock with his fingernails.\n\nYes,\n\nHe remembered correctly!\n\n\"Boss, I can't beat him. I'm old, useless now.\"\n\nOld Dao pretended to be dispirited, and even winked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal,\n\nHe brought his hand to his mouth,\n\nAnd gently,\n\nBlew on his fingernails...\n___\n*The original Chinese phrase \"拍头发\" (pāi tóufa) literally means \"patting hair\" or \"slapping hair.\" Its specific meaning or context in relation to using talismans is unclear and might refer to a specific, esoteric Taoist technique or a casual, unusual action.\n**The original Chinese phrase \"老嫩菊\" (lǎonèn jú) is crude internet slang. \"菊花\" (júhuā) means chrysanthemum, but is also slang for anus. \"老嫩\" (lǎonèn) means old and tender. Thus, \"老嫩菊\" refers to a person's face twisting into an ugly, puckered grimace, often implying extreme discomfort or pain, much like an \"old, puckered chrysanthemum\" or anal discomfort. The adaptation \"old, puckered grimace\" aims to preserve the imagery and humor without the vulgarity.",

    "content": "\"Ahhhhh!!!!\"\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!\"\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!\"\n\nScreams continuously echoed from the small hospital. Old Daoist stood at the entrance, watching many people in white coats run out as if something was chasing them.\n\nBut they just kept running in circles in the small courtyard, falling and getting back up, seemingly unable to see the door at all, with no one actually running out from inside.\n\n\"Is this... a ghost wall¹?\" Old Daoist asked Zhou Ze, looking at him.\n\nZhou Ze ignored him, continuing to watch.\n\nHe saw a woman constantly chasing people, asking:\n\n\"Should I be dead yet?\"\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Should I be dead?\"\n\nShe was desperate,\nShe was anxious,\nShe was flustered,\nAs if, if she didn't die at a fixed time, her son couldn't be redeemed.\nIf she didn't die at the prescribed time, her family would be shattered.\nIf she didn't die at the prescribed time, she would have made a huge mistake!\n\nZhou Ze's brow furrowed more and more as he watched.\n\nOld Daoist couldn't see what was happening inside, so he was confused, but watching a group of living people screaming and running around, constantly falling, was quite amusing, like a monkey show in a circus². And some of the female nurses, wearing skirts, stumbled and tore their clothes while running, revealing a great deal of skin:\n\nLace,\nHollow-edged,\nAnd Peppa Pig!\n\nOld Daoist, operating under the principle of reclaiming some interest for the victims, almost had his eyeballs pop out, anyway, he just kept looking at places he shouldn't.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze couldn't stand it anymore, truly couldn't stand it.\n\n\"What a... pig teammate³.\"\n\nOld Daoist, hearing this, froze for a moment, instantly feeling very wronged. His old face wrinkled into a tender chrysanthemum.\n\nBoss, do you have to be so discouraging?\n\nI was just looking...\n\nYou don't look, you're not interested, you're not stiff... *ahem*... but I'm still normal!\n\nZhou Ze reached out to Old Daoist for a lighter, just then seeing Old Daoist looking at him with a wronged expression. He then seemed to understand something and chuckled:\n\n\"Not talking about you.\"\n\n\"Then who?\" Old Daoist was genuinely puzzled.\n\n\"Talking about her.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze pushed open the door and walked in, leaning on his cane.\n\nOld Daoist followed him in. Anyway, wherever the boss went, he went, because no matter how amazing the boss was, he still needed a sidekick⁴ who could carry his bag and yell \"6666⁵.\"\n\nOld Daoist had always been very accurate with his self-positioning.\n\nHowever, the moment he followed his boss's steps and walked in, Old Daoist felt a chill run through him, as if while you were sound asleep, someone's cold hands gently glided over your back, giving you a fingertip caress.\n\nThat thrill,\nDirectly scared the soft, flaccid sack below Old Daoist's waist into a large walnut.\n\nImmediately after, a female nurse suddenly ran in front of Old Daoist and fell right there. Old Daoist quickly bent down to help her up.\n\n\"Are you okay? Are you okay?\"\n\nWhile helping her, his palm instinctively reached out to take advantage.\n\nHmm, this is also acting on behalf of Heaven to mete out justice⁶!\n\nHowever, to Old Daoist's surprise, the anticipated soft sensation didn't appear. Instead, his hand, with the force he applied, directly pierced into the female nurse's chest.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nOld Daoist instantly gasped in a cold breath, scared, and started to back away, but the female nurse stuck to him like a maggot attached to a bone⁷.\n\n\"Oh my god, Boss, help me, help me!\"\n\nThe female nurse in his arms suddenly lifted her head,\nHer face began to become rough and swollen, pockmarked, with maggots and crawling insects wriggling and moving through it.\n\nShe grinned,\nHer mouth full of yellow teeth, a large fleshy tumor protruded from her mouth. The tumor was yellowish-green, looking like it could burst at any moment.\n\n\"What time is it? Should I be dead yet?\"\n\nThe female nurse asked Old Daoist.\n\nOld Daoist was so scared he fumbled with his pants, only then realizing that the talisman he had earlier thrown away because his crotch felt hot was gone.\n\nAnd this action successfully caught the female nurse's attention; her hand also suddenly reached into Old Daoist's crotch area.\n\n\"Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!!!!!\"\n\nOld Daoist felt his dong, which had already shrunk from a gluten stick⁸ into a caterpillar, instantly shrink even further.\n\nThat walnut was almost frozen into a marble.\n\nSo cold,\nThe female nurse's hand was so cold,\nSo cold Old Daoist couldn't stand it.\nThis feeling was like stripping naked and pole dancing towards the sunrise on a peak in the Himalayas,\n\nThrilling and deadly!\n\nOld Daoist quickly raised both hands. No one was holding a gun to him, but someone was holding *his* gun⁹.\n\nSo, surrender was an instinctive action.\n\nBoss,\nWhere did you die off to?\nYour loyal Old Daoist is about to lose his lineage¹⁰!\n\n\"Enough!\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice came.\n\nOld Daoist felt that Zhou Ze's voice at that moment was even more pleasant than those beautiful celebrities on TV. It was a pity he couldn't see where the boss was standing, otherwise, he really wanted to rush over and kiss him hard!\n\n\"Dong... dong...\"\n\nA bell rang, signaling a return home.\nAll the surrounding images disappeared, and the terrifying cold sensation in Old Daoist's crotch also began to fade, leaving only a sore and numb aftereffect. He was almost scared into exhaustion, directly collapsing to his knees.\n\nHe looked up and saw Zhou Ze standing by a large clock in front.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's hand, there was still a clock hand he had just broken off.\n\n\"Zzzzt... Zzzzt zzzzt zzzzt...\"\n\nA fine, scratching sound came from the cement floor, like a broken wire, but it was very grating, making one's scalp tingle.\n\nOld Daoist looked around. Several doctors and nurses, including the burly security guard, lay motionless around him. They weren't dead; they were scared unconscious.\n\n\"Tell me... what time is it... should I be dead yet?\"\n\nFrom behind the large clock, a woman in white clothes crawled out. Her face was blank as she first stared at Old Daoist, scaring him into another shiver. Then, inadvertently, he stretched out a finger and pointed at Zhou Ze on the other side.\n\nThere,\nBig sister,\nThe big boss is over there. You go fight the big boss first. I'm just a small fry.\n\nThe female ghost indeed gave face, turning her head to look at Zhou Ze on the other side.\n\nThen, she began to crawl towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her, very disappointed.\n\nThis was genuine disappointment.\n\nIn his previous life, Zhou Ze was a doctor. He had always upheld his professional ethics. Although he didn't have the grand dream of \"saving all beings\" or the selfless dedication, in his work, he always adhered to the principle of \"people-oriented.\"\n\nThis small hospital was a microcosm of this street, a microcosm of this black gambling industry chain. It made Zhou Ze feel oppressed, very uncomfortable.\n\nIt was the kind of uncomfortable that made you feel you couldn't sleep well tonight if you didn't do something;\n\nAnd these few doctors and nurses who were currently lying unconscious on the ground, if no accident, should have graduated from proper medical schools or health schools, and possessed their own professional skills, definitely not just filling positions.\n\nYet, this group of people violated their ethics, betrayed their medical duty. They learned the skills to save lives but stood by dying patients, merely recording a series of cold data.\n\nThen,\nThey coldly watched patients die, absolutely refusing to offer aid, because rescue and medication would affect the fairness of the gambling.\n\nA common saying in medical circles goes: \"Whoever advises someone to study medicine deserves to be struck by lightning¹¹.\"\n\nMost doctors' work is far from as leisurely and comfortable as commonly perceived in society. The vast majority of medical staff face great dangers every day, from exposure and infection on the operating table, heavy workloads, and even... medical disputes¹².\n\nBut since one puts on that pure white attire, one must be worthy of their identity.\n\nThat's right,\nZhou Ze wanted them to die.\nWhether out of impulse or pique, at that moment, Zhou Ze truly hoped that all these industry scumbags would go to hell!\n\nPlaying with human lives, finding pleasure in human lives—this was a desecration of life. And Zhou Ze, as someone who had died once, understood even more the preciousness of life.\n\nSince you treat human lives as tools for cockfighting and dogfighting¹³, then I can also choose not to treat you as human.\n\nOld Daoist could even beat the burly security guard. Although Zhou Ze was leaning on a cane, with one flick of his fingernail, even an ox would collapse.\n\nBut Zhou Ze naturally withdrew, proclaiming \"Can't mess with this, can't mess with this.\"\n\nSome things, he found inconvenient to handle directly, so he wanted to watch the fire from across the river, observing from the sidelines¹⁴.\n\nHe was indulging, he was passively dealing with it.\nThe purpose,\nWas to borrow a knife to kill someone¹⁵.\n\nAnyway, it was inevitable for you to become a vengeful ghost; you can no longer enter reincarnation. Even if you go to hell, you can only endure endless karmic fire until your soul is scattered.\n\nSo,\nWhy not give you a chance,\nTo clean up this garbage dump?\nYou'll be satisfied,\nAnd I'll be satisfied.\nIt can also clear up some of the haze in this sky.\n\nBut this woman in front of him,\nWas like an idiot!\n\nZhou Ze had given her a chance, even subtly pushing her. She was much stronger than ordinary vengeful ghosts and had the ability to seek revenge.\n\nBut her so-called revenge was just scaring people unconscious?\nOnce they woke up, they'd be back to normal¹⁶?\n\n\"Zzzzt... Zzzzt... Zzzzt...\"\n\nThe female ghost continued to crawl towards Zhou Ze, then looked at him pitifully, asking:\n\n\"What time is it, should I be dead yet?\nPlease,\nTell me, tell me...\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly bent down, looking at the female ghost's pockmarked face, and asked:\n\n\"Don't you hate them?\"\n\nYes, don't you hate them?\n\n\"What time is it?\" The female ghost continued to ask.\n\nZhou Ze then pointed at the few unconscious nurses and doctors below and asked, \"Don't you want revenge?\"\n\nThey placed you on a cold bed, watching you die. Don't you want to take revenge on them? Don't you want to find those gamblers, don't you want to find those bookmakers who count money happily behind the scenes, don't you want to find your husband who personally pushed you into the abyss of despair—revenge?\n\n\"Please quickly tell me what time it is, I'm calculating if I should die. If I die, I'll get money, my husband will get money, our family will have money, and my son can be redeemed.\nPlease quickly tell me, tell me, what time is it, what time is it!\nI must die at the prescribed time. My family needs money, my son needs money when he grows up, he needs money for school, and he'll need money for marriage later.\nWhat time is it,\nPlease quickly tell me, tell me!!!!!\"\n\nThe female ghost seemed very angry that Zhou Ze repeatedly ignored her question. She began to become incredibly furious, so furious she wanted to strangle Zhou Ze!\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment.\nThis female ghost,\nShe didn't harbor murderous intent towards those doctors and nurses,\nBut she harbored murderous intent towards him?\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze wanted to laugh, and then he did.\n\n\"Hehehe...\"\n\nAs he laughed, Zhou Ze slowly stood up.\n\nThe female ghost instinctively wanted to pounce on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What are you laughing at? Answer me the time, what time is it!\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched out his hand, his fingernail directly piercing the female ghost's glabella. The female ghost let out a shrill scream. Zhou Ze's fingernail was like a soldering iron, bringing her terrifying pain.\n\n\"Boss?\" Old Daoist walked over at this moment.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes. He thought of the old woman who came to the bookstore that night, who cried bitterly, full of resentment, upon finding out she had died prematurely. He thought of the old man he saw earlier, lying in bed, watched by his son, waiting for the time to die.\n\nHuman life is precious, but only if one cherishes it and respects it;\nLife is your own. If you don't cherish it yourself, don't blame others for looking down on your life!\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\nAnd spoke:\n\"Old Daoist, I think I made a mistake. I seem to have been a little meddlesome.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Old Daoist still didn't understand.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes and looked at the several doctors and nurses lying unconscious on the ground. He said:\n\n\"I found that I don't hate these guys as much as before.\"\n\n\"Uh, why? They're just a bunch of animals,\" Old Daoist said.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the female ghost, who was constantly twisting and struggling under his hand,\nAnd said:\n\"Yes,\nThey are indeed animals,\nBut even a pitiable person must have something hateful about them¹⁷.\"\n\n---\n¹ Ghost wall (鬼打墙, *guǐ dǎ qiáng*): A supernatural phenomenon in Chinese folklore where one is trapped in a seemingly endless loop within a limited area, unable to find the way out, as if an invisible wall surrounds them.\n² Monkey show (耍猴, *shuǎ hóu*): Refers to a traditional street performance where monkeys perform tricks.

    "content": "The female ghost’s spirit body was damaged under Zhou Ze’s fingernails, to the point where it began to become transparent and unreal.\n\nShe was in great pain, very uncomfortable, and very pitiful, but for Zhou Ze, while he could try to use a borrowed knife to kill, it was impossible to let her leave this hospital, much less let her leave his sight and control.\n\nNow, she hadn’t become the knife, so he could only send her to where she belonged.\n\nThe gate of hell opened.\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the female ghost’s shoulder with one hand and directly threw her in. After being severely wounded by his fingernails, the female ghost had no room or strength to resist.\n\nClapping his hands, Zhou Ze took out his credential book; the percentage on it had risen to twenty-five percent.\n\nThe earnings from this female ghost were still very high. It wasn’t because Zhou Ze had simply taken advantage of the situation, but because this female ghost was originally an abomination born from the accumulated grievances of many people who died on this street.\n\nIt’s a pity she didn’t have the brutality of a vengeful spirit as imagined; a classic mismatch between her demeanor and her identity.\n\nZhou Ze leaned on his crutch and started walking out. He didn’t want to stay here anymore, unwilling to linger in this place that made even him, a ghost messenger, feel uncomfortable and depressed.\n\nOld Taoist followed along. After the two walked to the street corner, Old Taoist still subconsciously looked back. Inside, there were several similar small hospitals and clinics, and of course, many unlicensed operations hidden in corners.\n\nThis was the human world,\n\nYet it was more like hell’s incinerator.\n\nIn the invisible sky, it was as if chimneys rose from the ground, with clouds of smoke drifting, and those people lying on beds, agonizingly waiting to die, were like cartloads of cinders being sent into the incinerator.\n\n“Boss, shall we head back to the bookstore?” Old Taoist asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n“Boss, it’s not worth getting angry over that matter. Just let it go. That female ghost was actually quite pitiful. At least, she was a good mother.”\n\n“That’s precisely what I find tragic.”\n\n“Boss, you said ‘pitiful people must have hateful aspects’—I don’t agree. I think she didn’t do anything wrong. Anyway, if death is death, it’s better to sell oneself before dying and leave some income for the family. It’s only human nature. Although human lives cannot be bought or sold, when it really comes to that point, using up one’s last remaining value can actually be understood.\n\nMoreover, her actions didn’t harm anyone else. It was actually a matter of mutual consent.”\n\n“Old Taoist, have you ever been arrested by the police before?” Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n“Uh, a few times, that was because...”\n\n“Have you ever been caught in an anti-prostitution raid?”\n\n“Uh, not that one. Luckily, I was actually on tenterhooks sometimes. After all, I’m this old. Although it was to care for those ‘fallen women,’ my original intention was good, but I was also afraid of being misunderstood by outsiders.\n\nYou know, in this world, if you want to do something, especially good deeds, you are always very likely to face criticism.”\n\n“Then what do you think, is cracking down on prostitution right or wrong?”\n\n“Well...” Old Taoist didn’t know how to answer.\n\n“According to your logic, the ‘ladies’ are willing, they need money, and you also have needs, and you also give money. Both parties get what they need. Why should the police meddle?”\n\nOld Taoist didn’t know how to refute.\n\n“Even in the United States, which prides itself on freedom and openness, except for Nevada, which is adjacent to Los Angeles, prostitution is illegal in all other states in the United States.\n\nThe law is actually society’s last moral standard. And what you call ‘defending the fallen,’\n\nseemingly being about mutual benefit and consent, but if it were legalized or brought into the light, do you know how many prostitution rings it would give rise to? Many women would even be forced into prostitution. In the current illegal environment, there are already many examples of forced prostitution.”\n\n“India is a country that advocates for legalizing individual prostitution. Then India’s rape rate, you also understand.”\n\n“These are two separate things...” Old Taoist explained.\n\n“Two separate things?”\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nHe pointed to the street behind him and continued:\n\n“This is just the tip of the iceberg of what we see. Do you know, the flame of evil, at first, might just be a spark. There are moths willing to actively approach it. The fire is willing to burn them. The moths also made their own choice.\n\nBut when this fire grows larger and larger, it will no longer be satisfied with just incinerating the moths that willingly flew in. It will burn nearby houses, burn nearby forests. At that time, it will brew a great disaster.\n\nIn the end, aren’t those moths that previously fed the spark to grow larger also one of the culprits?\n\nWhen this industry begins to mature and continuously expand, who can guarantee that more bloody and exciting gambling methods won’t emerge? Furthermore, when there aren’t enough willing moths, won’t those who are addicted to this game, those platforms accustomed to earning huge incomes from this game, forcefully and semi-forcefully seek new chips to continue this game?\n\nHalf a year later,\n\nA year later,\n\nThree years later,\n\nThis increasingly massive and mature black industry captures an innocent person and creates some conditions to conduct similar death gambling.\n\nWon’t that person be qualified to curse the initial group of idiots who willingly became chips for money to join this game?”\n\nOld Taoist smacked his lips. He felt that the boss’s words seemed very reasonable, but he still felt something was off, and he bravely retorted:\n\n“Boss, I think the real culprit is still the masterminds behind the organization.”\n\n“When an avalanche occurs, no single snowflake is innocent.”\n\n…………\n\nWhen they returned to the bookstore, it was already dark. Because his mood wasn’t very good, Zhou Ze had walked back, which took quite a while.\n\nThe bookstore door was open. Tang Shi was sitting behind the counter, and inside, a man and a woman were sitting there reading books.\n\n“Where’s Bai Yingying?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“She went up to play games. I’m covering for her for a bit; she’s been in charge all day,” Tang Shi said indifferently.\n\nZhou Ze was speechless for a moment. It seemed he would have to limit that internet-addicted girl’s game time. To actually dare to leave the shop to Tang Shi to manage, wasn’t she afraid that if something really happened, the bookstore would be a bloodbath?\n\n“You two were out for quite a while. By the way, where’s Old Taoist?” Tang Shi, seeing that Old Taoist hadn’t returned to the bookstore with Zhou Ze, asked with some surprise.\n\n“He went to the police station to report the case,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\n“Want something to drink? A cocktail?”\n\n“You can mix them?”\n\nTang Shi didn’t speak. She started mixing cocktails on her own; her mixing movements were quick and skilled. Soon, a cocktail was placed in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n“Try it.”\n\nZhou Ze picked up the glass, took a sip, then nodded.\n\n“Very good.”\n\n“Thank you.” Tang Shi sat back in her chair, holding a book called \"Origin of Hell\" and reading it.\n\n“Is this book from the bookstore?” Zhou Ze had no impression of this book, and there was no publisher listed on it.\n\n“His book, a fantasy book from his chuunibyou phase[^1]. You can read it for fun to pass the time.”\n\nZhou Ze carried his drink and walked up the stairs. As soon as he pushed open the bedroom door, he saw Bai Yingying, wearing headphones at the computer desk, speaking very excitedly; it seemed like she was arguing with her teammates.\n\nThey on the other side seemed to not know she was a girl at first, and only realized it when she opened her mic during the argument, and seemed to have said something else.\n\n“Hehe, you want me to play with you?”\n\nBai Yingying didn’t know Zhou Ze was already standing behind her. She continued to speak daintily in a low voice:\n\n“Little brothers, want to sleep with a corpse? The kind that goes ‘ying ying ying’~.”\n\n“Go sleep with your mothers, you assholes! I’m old enough to be your great-great-grandmother!”\n\nThen, Bai Yingying took off her headphones, tossing them onto the desktop with disdain. Her body leaned slightly back, one long leg directly propped up. One hand very naturally took out a pack of ladies’ cigarettes from her clothes pocket. Skillfully, she tapped the cigarette filter-end down on the table, then put it into her mouth. Her fingertips rubbed together, sparks appeared, and she lit the cigarette.\n\n“That way of lighting a cigarette is good,” Zhou Ze said. “Can you teach me?”\n\n“Go ask your mother to teach you, this old lady doesn’t have time...”\n\nAs Bai Yingying spoke, she suddenly took a deep breath. She quickly extinguished the cigarette butt in her hand. Then she stood up. With her head bowed towards Zhou Ze, she greeted him in a soft, gentle voice:\n\n“Boss, you’re back.”\n\nZhou Ze sat down in the chair Bai Yingying had just been sitting in; the chair still held residual warmth. He took a cigarette from the pack and lit it. It was a ladies’ cigarette. He took a puff and slightly frowned. For Zhou Ze, the flavor of this ladies’ cigarette was still a bit too light.\n\n“You must have been holding it in hard, huh?”\n\nZhou Ze turned sideways to look at the female corpse.\n\nHe didn’t know when it started, but he had somewhat gotten used to Bai Yingying obediently staying by his side, “ying ying ying”-ing.\n\nHe seemed to have forgotten the deterrence and terror Bai Yingying brought to him and Xu Qinglang the first time she woke up in the bookstore. Zhou Ze was also somewhat dazed, wondering which one was the real her, after all.\n\n“No, Boss, please don’t misunderstand. In front of you, Yingying truly only acts dainty and reliant. Boss, you should actually know yourself,\n\nyou are also considered a zombie, and your bloodline is much higher than mine.”\n\nZhou Ze narrowed his eyes and said:\n\n“But in my previous life, I was just a doctor, just an ordinary person. I’ve always been curious about one thing: I’ve already died once and changed bodies. If it were just a bloodline issue, it should be ruled out. Otherwise, there’s only one explanation left, and that’s that Xu Le himself was a zombie. But that doesn’t make sense either.”\n\n“Boss, my mistress once told me, there are some zombies, they...”\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze’s phone rang. Zhou Ze picked up his phone, indicating to Bai Yingying to pause and continue later.\n\nIt was Old Taoist’s call. The two had walked back together, but Zhou Ze had given Old Taoist some hell money and told him to burn it somewhere before going to the police station to report the case.\n\n“Hello, did you report it?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Boss, I... I didn’t dare to report...” Old Taoist said, trembling, from his end.\n\n“Didn’t you burn the hell money? Just participating in gambling, and having the circumstances of turning yourself in and reporting, plus burning some hell money, you wouldn’t even be detained. At most, you’d give a statement.”\n\n“No... No, Boss... I’m inside the police station. Now there are many reporters here. It’s said that half an hour ago, someone reported that all the nurses, doctors, and patients in a hospital were killed. It seems... it seems to be the hospital we went to earlier.\n\nBoss, I really can’t turn myself in now. Burning more hell money won’t help either. If I turn myself in, the police will definitely detain me as the prime suspect.”\n\n“Everyone died?”\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. That shouldn’t be right. When he left, those doctors and nurses were just lying there unconscious, not seriously injured. He estimated they would wake up on their own after a while.\n\n“Indeed, it’s that hospital,” Old Taoist said in a lowered voice. “I just asked a reporter, and he told me.”\n\n“How is that possible? We haven’t been gone long.”\n\n“Boss...” Old Taoist asked somewhat nervously, “Didn’t you also find it strange before, why that female ghost didn’t kill or seek revenge?”\n\n“What are you trying to say?”\n\n“This humble Taoist is thinking, at that time, perhaps two ghosts appeared, but one of them hid himself.”\n\n---\n[^1]: Chuunibyou (中二病) literally means \"middle school second-year syndrome\" in Japanese and is a slang term in East Asia used to describe teenagers who have delusions of grandeur, believing they have hidden powers or knowledge, or that they are special in some way.",

    "content": "Due to the sudden nature of the incident and the large number of deceased—a full dozen or more—several bodies were transferred to Tongcheng Affiliated Hospital to assist with the forensic investigation, aiming to expedite the autopsy and examination process.\n\nTongcheng is a peaceful city. Precisely for this reason, the sudden appearance of a murder case of such severe nature immediately attracted attention from all sides. News about this matter had already spread widely in WeChat Moments and Weibo circles, and many citizens even felt panic and unease because of it.\n\nTo a certain extent, this put pressure on the investigating police.\n\nThe police force was fully committed in hopes of finding the truth of the incident soon, and a special task force was also directly established. Of course, these matters had nothing to do with Zhou Ze.\n\nAt present, he only needed to first confirm one thing: whether those deceased doctors and nurses were killed by humans, or by... ghosts.\n\nIn reality, Zhou Ze felt no unease regarding the deaths of those people, nor did he feel the need to randomly pin any responsibility or guilt on himself. If that female ghost had been a bit more cooperative, she would have long become Zhou Ze's knife for killing with another's hand¹. Those scumbags who treated human lives as gambling tools, their deaths would instead make this world a bit cleaner.\n\nWhat Zhou Ze couldn't tolerate was if there truly was another ghost, hiding in the shadows all along, and he hadn't discovered it, only for it to start killing as soon as he left—that would be his dereliction of duty.\n\nHunting geese all day, only to have his eye pecked out by a goose²—that feeling was far from pleasant.\n\nCasually stealing a white lab coat and putting it on, Zhou Ze walked into the morgue. Two bodies were being autopsied; three were still here. Zhou Ze used to be a doctor here and had worked for ten years, so he was naturally very familiar with the Affiliated Hospital.\n\nMoreover, Zhou Ze had actually already visited this morgue once since his rebirth. Last time, he had even encountered the matter here of several children fighting over their deceased old mother's property, with no one claiming her body.\n\nOld Taoist also hurried over from the police station and met Zhou Ze at the Affiliated Hospital. He had pulled some strings with reporters, obtaining some superficial information reports, and quickly came to report to Zhou Ze.\n\nHowever, to the old man's disappointment, Zhou Ze was not interested in these messages. Unlike his previous boss, he had little interest in investigating cases.\n\nThe temperature in the morgue, of course, couldn't be high; inside and out, it exuded a chilling aura.\n\n\"Boss, why are the bodies being transported to the hospital for autopsy?\" Old Taoist couldn't understand this.\n\n\"Forensic talent, even in developed countries, is in short supply. It's the same domestically. If it were just a case involving one or two lives, of course, it wouldn't be necessary. But this time, more than a dozen people died. The forensic resources originally allocated to the Tongcheng police station would definitely be insufficient; they can only rely on the strength of civilian units for assistance.\"\n\nZhou Ze checked the numbers, then glanced at the forms behind the door before pulling out a freezer drawer. Inside lay the body of an old woman with gray hair.\n\nOld Taoist looked at the body, immediately widened his eyes, and said, \"This must have been done by a ghost! The nurse lady has been sucked dry into a husk!\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and tapped the metal plate. \"This is the body of a patient from that hospital's basement.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\nOld Taoist awkwardly scratched his head.\n\n\"How did she die then?\" Old Taoist asked again.\n\n\"The deceased already had cancer before death. Those patients lying in the basement, used as gambling tools, had long had all medical assistance terminated. They could have died at any time. From what I can tell, this body has no obvious external injuries. Nor did I sense any lingering malevolent aura on her.\"\n\n\"So, her cause of death is strange and hard to find?\" Old Taoist said, stroking his chin in a pretentious manner, as if, at this moment, he too was deep in thought. \"Well, that's interesting! The cause of death is mysterious; there's definitely something fishy going on.\"\n\n\"Died of illness.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I said, she probably died of illness.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\nIf it wasn't Zhou Ze in front of him, but someone else, Old Taoist probably would have just started ranting³.\n\nDied of illness, and you analyzed it for so long, and even made me pretend to be so engrossed.\n\nWon't I be embarrassed!\n\nZhou Ze ignored Old Taoist's thoughts. Instead, he pulled out the second body. This was a male corpse, a young male corpse.\n\n\"This body looks a bit familiar... Oh, oh damn! It's that security guard's body!\" Old Taoist recognized who the body was; after all, he had had \"physical contact\"⁴ with this security guard.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and lifted the corpse's jaw. There was a dark red wound there.\n\nThe wound was very deep, and the cut was very smooth.\n\n\"Was his throat slit?\"\n\nOld Taoist guessed.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. The cause of death was excessive blood loss from a sharp object cutting the throat.\n\nZhou Ze then pushed open the freezer drawer containing the third body. This was a female corpse.\n\n\"I know this one too. She's a female nurse from the hospital. She was wearing Peppa Pig underwear at the time, so this humble Taoist couldn't help but take a few extra glances.\"\n\nZhou Ze checked the female corpse's jaw area and found no wound there. But then, tracing down the neck, Zhou Ze saw a very deep cut below the female corpse's left breast. The wound mark wasn't as long as the male corpse's neck wound, but its depth should be more terrifying.\n\nExcluding other possible accidental factors, and purely analyzing based on Zhou Ze's own experience from his previous life, the fatal wounds for these two people should be the two wounds he found.\n\n\"This was stabbed with a dagger, right?\"\n\nOld Taoist was also someone who had wandered the rivers and lakes⁵; for a while, he had even been a barefoot doctor in the countryside. Although it was mostly just the skill of tricking people, he was still considered well-traveled and knowledgeable.\n\n\"It should be a sharp object, similar to a dagger.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nGhosts don't use knives to kill. Therefore, currently, it should be man-made.\n\nSince it's man-made, then it has nothing to do with Zhou Ze. Affairs of the living world are for the police to handle; he is only responsible for containing ghosts.\n\nBut this matter still made Zhou Ze very uncomfortable. It's true that he had wanted to kill these few doctors and nurses before, but in the end, he didn't. However, a scene could actually be inferred in his mind:\n\nThat is, after he and Old Taoist left,\n\nsomeone, holding a dagger or a small knife or similar, came to this hospital. And these nurses and doctors were likely still unconscious.\n\nHe approached them one by one, slitting their throats with the dagger, or stabbing their abdomens, causing them to die painfully from excessive blood loss while unconscious.\n\nThe people the ghosts didn't kill, humans helped kill instead.\n\nWhether I kill or not is my business; for you to come in for the kill-steal while I'm gone and they're unconscious, Zhou Ze felt taken advantage of and manipulated.\n\n\"Let's go, it's fine.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nSince it wasn't a ghost causing trouble, Zhou Ze also intended to withdraw.\n\n\"Then... do I still need to turn myself in?\"\n\n\"With such a major incident, it's impossible for some things to remain hidden. Even if you don't turn yourself in, this black industry chain will be dug up because of this incident.\"\n\n\"That's good then.\"\n\nOld Taoist was genuinely worried that Zhou Ze would continue to make him turn himself in and become some sort of tainted witness.\n\nWalking out of the hospital, it was already late night. Outside, there were quite a few late-night food stalls. Old Taoist suggested they eat something; after all, he hadn't eaten anything since noon.\n\nZhou Ze nodded in agreement. He also felt his steps were a bit light. Xu Qinglang had gone back to his hometown, and his appetite had been noticeably poor these past few days.\n\nHowever, because he hadn't brought sour plum juice, Old Taoist was eating heartily beside him, but Zhou Ze found it very difficult to eat. Each mouthful of food had to be swallowed with extreme difficulty, forcing down the nausea.\n\nMoreover, late-night food stall dishes tend to be quite oily, which made it even harder for Zhou Ze to eat.\n\nAs Old Taoist ate, he wiped his mouth, stood up, and went to the front. When he returned, he had two still-warm steamed buns in his hand.\n\n\"Boss, you should eat something lighter. There's a 24-hour noodle and pastry shop just ahead; I bought you two steamed buns.\"\n\nZhou Ze also put down his chopsticks and took the steamed buns. He had to eat something; at the very least, he needed to maintain the energy required for his body's activities. He couldn't let his body become depleted and collapse.\n\nHolding the steamed bun in his hand, Zhou Ze shook his head helplessly. \"The steamed buns aren't fresh.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Old Taoist said helplessly, \"It's already night, after all. If you want fresh ones, you'll have to wait until the morning when they first open.\"\n\nZhou Ze poked the steamed bun with his fingernail. It was soft on the outside, but a bit hard on the inside.\n\nJust as he was about to tear off a piece and put it in his mouth, Zhou Ze suddenly froze.\n\nHe suddenly turned the steamed bun around, looking at the spot where his fingernail had just pierced it.\n\nDropping the steamed bun in his hand, Zhou Ze immediately stood up and ran across the road towards the hospital.\n\n\"Boss!\"\n\nOld Taoist called out, and seeing that Zhou Ze didn't respond, he had no choice but to throw two hundred yuan onto the table, shout \"Check please!\" to the late-night food stall owner, and then run after his boss.\n\nThe two returned to the hospital, and Zhou Ze still headed straight for the morgue. Coincidentally, a doctor in a white lab coat walked out of the morgue door; fortunately, he was facing away from Zhou Ze, walking towards the other side, and went upstairs from there.\n\nAfter that doctor left, Zhou Ze and Old Taoist opened the morgue door and entered again.\n\nZhou Ze personally pulled open a freezer drawer. The female corpse lay inside.\n\n\"Boss, what happened?\" Old Taoist asked, panting.\n\n\"It wasn't killed by a dagger.\" Zhou Ze said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Not a dagger, then it's a small knife, right? You ran all the way back just for this?\" Old Taoist sighed.\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\nInstead, he silently let his index fingernail grow out.\n\nThen,\n\nthe pitch-black fingernail was gently placed by Zhou Ze below the female corpse's left breast.\n\nFollowing the wound left there,\n\nit pierced inside.\n\nA perfect fit!\n\nNot killed by a dagger,\n\nnor by a small knife,\n\nand not even killed by any sharp tool.\n\nIt was a fingernail.\n\nA fingernail!\n\nOld Taoist's mouth immediately dropped open. He was so surprised he didn't know what to say; he could only stammer:\n\n\"Zom... zom...\"\n\n\"I knew why, the first time I saw this wound, I had a familiar feeling.\" Zhou Ze turned his head, looked at Old Taoist, and said, \"Pull out the male corpse's freezer drawer too, and let's verify again.\"\n\nOld Taoist immediately nodded and pulled open the freezer drawer where the male corpse was.\n\nThen Old Taoist completely froze.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Boss, bad news, something's happened!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze withdrew his fingernail, turned around, and looked towards Old Taoist.\n\n\"The body... the body's gone!\"\n\nOld Taoist turned his body to face Zhou Ze, gesturing that the freezer drawer he pulled out was empty.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nan even more terrifying scene appeared. Old Taoist reached out, his hand trembling, and pointed at Zhou Ze,\n\nbecause he saw,\n\nbehind Zhou Ze,\n\nthe female corpse that was originally lying on the freezer shelf,\n\nwas slowly sitting up.\n\nThe female corpse turned her face,\n\nwith a smile,\n\nand looked at him...\n***\n¹ *To kill with another's hand:* An idiom meaning to achieve one's goal by using someone else as a tool.\n² *To hunt geese all day only to have one's eye pecked out by a goose:* An idiom meaning to be tricked or harmed by someone or something one usually has control over or underestimates.\n³ *Started ranting:* Literally \"started spraying,\" meaning to curse, rant, or verbally attack someone.\n⁴ *Physical contact:* Used humorously here to mean a scuffle or fight.\n⁵ *Wandered the rivers and lakes:* An idiom referring to having experience in society, often implying a world of wanderers, martial artists, or even con artists.",

    "content": "女屍忽然地坐起，萬籟俱寂。\n\n\n\n  這很像是恐怖電影裡的經典情節和橋段，主角和某龍套調查某件事的途中，忽然出現了極為驚悚的一幕，整件事開始滑落向不可探知的神秘深淵。\n\n\n\n  「老闆…………」\n\n\n\n  老道也算是見多識廣了，但這種詭異的事情，他還是第一次看見，畢竟以往的很多次事件，其實到最後都是「人」的因素比較大，而鬼，在很多時候反而顯得有些束手束腳。\n\n\n\n  但眼前，\n\n\n\n  這他娘的是真的詐屍了啊！\n\n\n\n  「怎麼了？」周澤問道，他沒有回頭，而是看著老道。\n\n\n\n  「你……你……」\n\n\n\n  女屍看著身前的周澤，她其實沒有笑，但在這種氛圍和此時的燈光下，在老道的視野之中，女屍仿佛是一條毒蛇，正在準備擇人而噬。\n\n\n\n  也因此，給了老道一種女屍正在笑的錯覺，仿佛一切，都正在她的掌控之中。\n\n\n\n  「說話啊，餵。」周澤見老道還在吱吱唔唔地，顯得有些不耐煩。\n\n\n\n  而女屍也在此時張開了嘴，對著周澤的脖子位置，咬了下來。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你後面…………」\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  周澤忽然伸出一隻手，像是捕蛇人抓蛇抓七寸一樣，扣住了女屍的脖頸位置，且指甲在剎那間刺入了女屍的脖頸之中。 \n\n\n\n  女屍開始扭動，開始掙扎沒，她顯得很痛苦。\n\n\n\n  「到底什麼事，說啊。」周澤催促道。\n\n\n\n  見此一幕，老道剛剛提在嗓子眼兒上的心，一下子又重重地回落下去。\n\n\n\n  「沒事了。」老道有氣無力地回答道，他覺得自己很浪費表情和情緒。\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  周澤應了一聲，然後把女屍摔向了地面。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  一聲脆響，女屍的皮囊在此時開始龜裂，從裡面開始有黑色的膿水慢慢地滲透出來，像是小孩子惡趣味之下所玩的注水氣球落在了地上炸裂。\n\n\n\n  當裡面的水分滲透而出後，只剩下了殘破的氣球皮。\n\n\n\n  女屍也是如此，當這些黑色的膿水迸濺出來後，她的骨骼和內在仿佛已經完全消失，只剩下了最為外在的一層皮囊，在膿水之中，浮浮沉沉。\n\n\n\n  那張臉，在液體浸泡之中不斷地褶皺變化，像是一個人在不停地變幻著表情。\n\n\n\n  周澤看著自己的指甲，指甲位置出現了幾道缺口，在剛才自己再度刺入女屍體內時，明顯地感受到了一種強烈的腐蝕性，對自己的指甲造成了一定的損傷。\n\n\n\n  可怕詭異的一幕以這樣子的一種方式被周澤輕描淡寫地化解，老道有一種大家劇本拿錯了的荒謬感，甚至心裡升騰起白瞎了這麼好氛圍和鋪墊的錯覺。 \n\n\n\n  他馬上使勁揉了揉臉，強迫自己清醒過來，然後道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，我想到了一件事，剛剛我們進來時，不是正好有個穿著白大褂的醫生走出去麼，\n\n\n\n  他是真的醫生麼？」\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊啊啊！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  樓上，傳來的刺耳的尖叫聲。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  病房裡，一個女孩坐在旁邊的床上，忍不住打著瞌睡，而她剛剛做完手術的母親，躺在床上掛著點滴，麻醉還沒過去。\n\n\n\n  女孩迷迷糊糊地睡了一會兒，身體一晃，醒了過來，她很累，但她睡得並不踏實，她需要照顧自己的母親，至少，要看著點滴是否掛完以叫護士來幫忙換新的點滴瓶。\n\n\n\n  她抬起頭看了一下，這一瓶快掛完了，站起身，女孩輕輕地打了一個呵欠，然後伸手按住了床邊的呼叫按鈕，通知護士來幫忙換一下點滴瓶。\n\n\n\n  按鈕按了下去，但等了一會兒卻不見有護士過來，女孩有些著急了，走到病房門口推開門，她打算去另一頭的護士站那裡看一下，可能值班的護士也睡著了。\n\n\n\n  推開門，剛走出去，女孩就看見在走廊的對面，站著一個身穿著白大褂的男醫生，對方戴著白色的口罩，側對著自己。\n\n\n\n  「醫生，麻煩一下，我這裡換瓶子。」 \n\n\n\n  女孩對醫生喊道。\n\n\n\n  醫生沒理會她，繼續站在那裡原地不動。\n\n\n\n  「醫生？醫生？我們這裡換瓶子。」\n\n\n\n  女孩繼續喊道。\n\n\n\n  醫生身體微微一顫，像是剛才在發呆被驚醒了一樣，然後他半轉過身，向這女孩的方向走了過來。\n\n\n\n  女孩也算是長舒一口氣，自己母親還剩下最後一瓶輸液，到時候自己也算是能稍微踏實地睡一會兒了。\n\n\n\n  只是，漸漸地，女孩察覺到了一些不對勁，好像有哪個地方，有什麼問題。\n\n\n\n  一開始，女孩兒認為是自己太累了導致了精神衰弱，看什麼都覺得不舒服，但慢慢地，女孩發現並不是這個原因，而是前面那位正在向這邊走來的醫生，本就有問題。\n\n\n\n  他……赤著腳！\n\n\n\n  是的，一名醫生，在醫院赤著腳走路？\n\n\n\n  赤著腳上班？\n\n\n\n  可能麼？\n\n\n\n  女孩馬上後退兩步，把病房門給關上，然後馬上自裡面反鎖，這是她下意識地反應。\n\n\n\n  事實上，每個人都有著第六感，人類的祖先過著茹毛飲血的日子時，無時無刻都在提防著來自野獸的襲擊，自然有著一種趨利避害的本能。\n\n \n\n  當然，隨著人類社會的發展，人類站在食物鏈頂端也已經很久很久了，這種本能也在慢慢地退化之中，但有些人，內心本就更敏感一些，對那種危險的感知也比普通人更精敏一點。\n\n\n\n  透過病房門上的透明玻璃，女孩看見那位男醫生還在向這裡走，他的走路姿勢，也有些怪異。\n\n\n\n  一步邁出去之後，他的腳緊接著一個扭動，連帶著身體也在扭動，像是卓別林無聲喜劇里誇張搞笑的走路方式。\n\n\n\n  但在深夜，在醫院，在沒什麼人的病房過道里，這種走路方式，帶給人的不是喜劇，而是一種毛骨悚然的大恐怖！\n\n\n\n  醫生繼續往這裡走，其擺動的幅度也在越來越大，女孩甚至聽到了「嘎吱嘎吱」的聲響。\n\n\n\n  女孩覺得自己是不是在做噩夢？\n\n\n\n  為什麼在醫院裡會出現這樣子的一幕？\n\n\n\n  她低下頭，閉上了眼，強迫自己安靜下來，如果這是夢的話，請醒來。\n\n\n\n  隨後，她睜開眼，發現自己依舊站在門後面，這好像，不是夢。\n\n\n\n  鼓足勇氣，女孩再次透過病房門上的玻璃窗向外看去，卻發現那個醫生已經不見了，完全看不見了。\n\n\n\n  女孩有些迷茫，這到底是怎麼回事？\n\n\n\n  自己看花眼了？ \n\n\n\n  還是自己已經產生錯覺了？\n\n\n\n  她沒敢開門，哪怕是自己看花眼了，她也沒準備在此時開門出去再確認一下，她畢竟是個女孩子，在母親病倒之後，她顯得更加地謹慎。\n\n\n\n  外面，好像真的沒人了。\n\n\n\n  女孩的臉貼在了門上面，以讓自己透過玻璃可以獲得更多的視野。\n\n\n\n  忽然間，\n\n\n\n  女孩感覺自己面前的光線被遮擋住了。\n\n\n\n  一張戴著口罩的男醫生的臉，\n\n\n\n  悄無聲息地自玻璃窗那邊出現，\n\n\n\n  他和女孩臉的距離，\n\n\n\n  只隔著一厘米不到的玻璃厚度！\n\n\n\n  女孩被完全嚇傻了，\n\n\n\n  她忘記了尖叫，忘記了一切，只是傻乎乎地愣在那裡，看著玻璃窗外的那個人，那張臉！\n\n\n\n  口罩，在蠕動，像是對方在口罩覆蓋下的嘴巴正在說話，但對方口裡發出的，不是人的語言，而是之前所聽到的：\n\n\n\n  「嘎吱嘎吱」\n\n\n\n  像是下雨天穿著雨靴行走在泥濘的水塘里。\n\n\n\n  而男醫生的眼睛，更是大得誇張無比，是普通人眼睛的五六倍大，其眼珠子就像是泡得浮腫一樣，有雞蛋那麼大的體積，幾乎要從眼眶裡擠爆出來。 \n\n\n\n  同時，這眼珠子也在不停地搖晃著，晃晃悠悠的，像是木偶人的眼珠，可以上下翻轉，仿佛隨時都可能脫落。\n\n\n\n  女孩捂住了自己的嘴，她的身體因為巨大的恐懼而顫抖。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  是轉動門把手的聲音，\n\n\n\n  那個醫生，正在開門！\n\n\n\n  女孩馬上身體向前，抵住了病房門。\n\n\n\n  門她之前剛剛上鎖了，所以外面沒能打開，但正因為打不開，外面的醫生開始撞門了。\n\n\n\n  「砰！砰！砰！…………」\n\n\n\n  女孩咬著牙，抵著門，她的眼裡，全是淚水，她很害怕，很驚慌，她不知道為什麼在醫院裡會發生這種事。\n\n\n\n  「嘎吱嘎吱嘎吱…………」\n\n\n\n  隨著撞擊門的聲音以外，那種「嘎吱嘎吱」的聲音也越來越劇烈和清晰。\n\n\n\n  「嘣！」\n\n\n\n  一聲響動自門外傳來，\n\n\n\n  女孩不知道發生了什麼，但她忽然發現外面的那個不再撞門了，她倚靠著門，重重地喘著氣。\n\n\n\n  太可怕了，\n\n\n\n  真的太可怕了，\n\n\n\n  如果這是一場噩夢，請讓自己快點醒來吧。 \n\n\n\n  但很快，女孩忽然發現自己腳下濕答答的，像是在自己身下有一灘水流了進來。\n\n\n\n  女孩低下頭，看向地面，\n\n\n\n  好像有什麼白色的東西順著地上的膿水從底下門縫裡滲透過來，\n\n\n\n  這是一張人皮！\n\n\n\n  最上面是一張扭曲成麻花的臉，\n\n\n\n  那一雙巨大的眼珠子像是兩枚剛剛打出的雞蛋黃裹挾著雞蛋清一樣流動著。\n\n\n\n  「吧唧」一聲，\n\n\n\n  其中一顆眼珠子爆裂開，腥黃色的液體濺射到了女孩的臉上，\n\n\n\n  另一個眼珠子則是繼續打著轉兒，\n\n\n\n  像是那個醫生，躺在地上，眯著一隻眼，睜著一隻眼，帶著戲謔之色，\n\n\n\n  在看著自己。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊啊！！！！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  女孩崩潰了，\n\n\n\n  尖叫聲，\n\n\n\n  響徹整個住院部大樓。",

    "content": "Zhou Ze and Old Taoist followed the screams and found that floor. Because Zhou Ze's legs were inconvenient, by the time they arrived, many people had already gathered there. Many family members of patients staying overnight nearby had come out to gawk, several layers deep;\n\nEven some patients in hospital gowns, holding their IV drip bags with one hand and leaning on the wall with the other, came over to watch the show, profoundly illustrating the spirit of \"life never stops, and neither does watching the spectacle.\"\n\nNearby, several nurses were comforting a girl, and someone was also calling to notify the hospital security. The security guards should arrive soon.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze was also wearing a white lab coat, he and Old Taoist easily pushed through the crowd and walked inside.\n\nOn the ground was a puddle of yellowish-brown pus, and something like an egg yolk was constantly floating in it. Those who didn't know would have thought someone had peeled an egg and thrown it there, but only Zhou Ze knew that this thing was actually a human eyeball.\n\n\"Boss, this fellow's amniotic fluid has broken too.\"\n\nOld Taoist whispered into Zhou Ze's ear.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. The more critical the moment, the more Old Taoist liked to act foolishly. This might be a self-preservation mechanism for him under stress, an involuntary way to relax himself during tense moments.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze extended his index finger and stirred the pus below.\n\nSeeing this, Old Taoist also squatted down and extended his finger to stir it. To be honest, this stuff was too disgusting, but since his boss was doing it, he could only follow suit.\n\nIt must be said that Old Taoist was a very aspiring person; whether following his previous boss or his current one, he always had a strong desire to learn and imitate.\n\nImmediately, Old Taoist witnessed a scene that made him want to vomit his supper: Zhou Ze actually put his middle finger into his mouth and sucked it, then lowered his head in contemplation, as if distinguishing the components within.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nHe even smacked his lips.\n\nSo dedicated?\n\nWhat does it taste like?\n\nOld Taoist hesitated for a moment,\n\nHis mind waged numerous battles in a short time, but in the end,\n\nHe also put the finger that had just stirred the pus into his mouth and tasted it. The flavor was overwhelming; a pungent, spicy, stinging sensation immediately exploded upon entry, burning his throat more than high-proof liquor.\n\nMoreover, there was a taste of aged seafood, a taste that most boys and some girls basically knew.\n\nOld Taoist's face turned green, but seeing his boss continue to ponder there with a normal expression, at that moment, Old Taoist inexplicably felt a bizarre feeling of \"gazing up at a high mountain\" for Zhou Ze.\n\nTo endure that taste, he's truly not human!\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and saw Old Taoist's wretched, as if violated, face, then looked at the liquid still clinging to Old Taoist's fingertip, and asked in surprise:\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nOld Taoist lightly patted his chest and said heroically, \"Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs, and what my boss can do, this humble Taoist can naturally do too.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and smiled.\n\nOld Taoist felt flattered, as if at this moment he was finally acknowledged by his boss, just like Patriarch Subhuti consecutively tapped Monkey King's head three times.\n\n\"I used my index finger to stir, but the finger I put in my mouth was my middle finger.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his fingers at Old Taoist and continued:\n\n\"When I ate supper just now, some chives got stuck in my teeth. I was just digging them out. Who'd be sick in the head to taste this stuff? Are you a masochist?\"\n\n\"............\" Old Taoist.\n\nOld Taoist wanted to say something more, but his stomach immediately began to cramp, and he pushed through the surrounding crowd, rushing straight to the restroom to vomit.\n\nZhou Ze silently rubbed his chin. The frightened girl was still sitting in the hospital room, with several nurses comforting her beside her. Zhou Ze didn't go to inquire about the girl's condition, after all, he had experienced a similar scene himself in the morgue before.\n\nIt's just that for him, some things were merely a small matter, but for ordinary people, they were already shocking enough to shake the world.\n\nA dead body suddenly sat up,\n\nThe fatal wounds came from incredibly sharp fingernails that could be used as weapons,\n\nThe pus that the body ultimately turned into,\n\nAll of it indicated that the killer was not an ordinary human, but a devil hidden in the darkness. In fact, since Zhou Ze became a Ghost Messenger, he had never encountered such a mysterious and resourceful opponent.\n\nThat thing clearly couldn't be regarded as an ordinary malevolent ghost.\n\nStanding up, Zhou Ze walked to the other end of the corridor, took out his phone, and dialed Tang Shi's number.\n\n\"Hello.\" Tang Shi's voice was as cold as ever.\n\n\"Do me a favor. It seems a... a wild zombie has appeared here.\"\n\n\"You can go find plants.\"\n\nThe implication was that she was busy and couldn't be bothered.\n\n\"Then help me call Bai Yingying and ask her to come to the hospital.\"\n\n\"That's fine.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Zhou Ze once again wondered if keeping Tang Shi by his side was a wrong decision. This woman was even more of a vase than a vase.\n\nHis own Yingying was still better.\n\nBoth were women, neither were alive, yet the difference could be so immense.\n\nOld Taoist had vomited all the sour liquid from his stomach. He walked out of the restroom and came to Zhou Ze's side, asking somewhat resentfully:\n\n\"Why did that thing kill and then pull such a stunt?\"\n\n\"He did it on purpose,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"So people killed by him turn into zombies? Hey, that's just like the old Hong Kong zombie movies from the eighties and nineties: people bitten by zombies also turn into zombies.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Old Taoist looked into Zhou Ze's eyes, a little eager to try.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Uh, Boss, I have a small request. Can all zombies become like Bai Yingying?\"\n\n\"State your purpose directly, don't beat around the bush.\"\n\n\"Uh, cough, cough... What this humble Taoist means is, look, Boss, I'm old now, and who knows, one day I might just kick the bucket and seek refuge in the Western Pure Land.\"\n\n\"You're a Taoist, not a monk.\"\n\n\"Uh, then it's kick the bucket and ascend to immortality. But this Old Taoist worries, if I'm gone, who will take care of you?\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"So, Boss, if that day comes, could you bite me?\"\n\n\"I find it disgusting.\"\n\n\"............\" Old Taoist.\n\nCan we even be friends anymore!\n\n\"It's not as exaggerated as you think. Being bitten by a zombie won't turn you into one. If you don't believe me, you can go back and let Bai Yingying bite you on the neck. Other than contracting corpse poison and speeding up your demise, I guarantee there will be no other effect.\n\nAs for becoming a zombie, you might as well choose an ominous tomb and bury yourself. Perhaps in a hundred years or so, you might hop out, but the 'you' after that will actually have nothing to do with the 'you' now; it will be a new life.\"\n\n\"So movies are all lies?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\nOld Taoist looked somewhat dejected. He had originally thought he had found a way to extend his life, but who knew this would be the result. Still, Old Taoist was not entirely resigned and asked:\n\n\"Then what happened to these two people?\"\n\n\"What was the end result?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"They just split open, and their bones and organs all turned into pus.\"\n\n\"Why was that?\"\n\n\"Because they were used as nutrients and absorbed. They didn't turn into zombies. And even if they did, stepping back ten thousand paces, would you want to be that kind of zombie?\"\n\n\"Then will he continue killing?\" Old Taoist asked, somewhat worried.\n\n\"If he hasn't eaten his fill,\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips. \"Of course, even if he's full, it doesn't mean he won't get hungry again.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly seemed to remember something and said to Old Taoist, \"Try to help me find out what happened to those other bodies in the end, whether a similar situation occurred...\"\n\nHis phone rang at that moment. Zhou Ze picked it up and saw the caller ID showed \"Wang Ke.\"\n\nSince the last time with the \"meat-eating\" incident, Zhou Ze hadn't contacted Wang Ke again, and Wang Ke had also promised not to actively contact him.\n\n\"Hello.\" Zhou Ze still answered the phone.\n\n\"I'm sorry I have to break my word, but I think you'll be interested in this,\" Wang Ke's voice came from the other end of the phone.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Have you heard about the mass death incident at that small hospital?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, looked at the puddle of pus behind him, and said:\n\n\"Just heard about it.\"\n\n\"I'm a part-time consultant for the police department, usually helping with psychological profiling and such. This incident is very serious, and I've been invited to help. Based on the existing known conditions, I need to delineate some psychological and physical characteristics of the killer. Heh heh, for this, I drew a sketch. Would you like to see it?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Ding dong...\"\n\nThe notification sound of a message from WeChat,\n\nZhou Ze minimized the call and opened WeChat,\n\nIt was a very rough sketch, but the person in the sketch made Zhou Ze's pupils constrict.\n\n\"What kind of joke are you playing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Heh heh, I don't believe it's you, but the person I drew based on the known conditions and clues really looks a lot like you. How about it? This time, I'm not asking you for a favor; I'm just asking if you're interested?\"\n\n\"Interested in what?\"\n\n\"Here, I can get all the information from the police investigation.\" Wang Ke, on the other end of the phone, rubbed his brow, sounding a bit tired. \"Although I really don't want to admit it, and I feel a bit helpless, I increasingly believe that the killer in this case might not be human.\"\n\n\"Are you at the police station?\"\n\n\"No, I'm at home. You can come to my place. The case files and the latest information will all be compiled here for me.\" Wang Ke paused, then added, \"Also, I'm cooking meat soup for supper. You can have some.\"\n\nZhou Ze directly ignored the latter part of the conversation. He simply said, \"I'll be over.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze was about to hang up, but Wang Ke's voice came again: \"Don't hang up yet.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\n\"Hmm, I've never had a chance to say this to anyone before, and saying something like this to others isn't good, it's like cursing them;\n\nBut this time, it's a rare opportunity. This is the first time I've ever said this to anyone:\n\nHappy Qingming Festival.\"",

    "content": "When Zhou Ze and Old Dao walked out of the hospital, Bai Yingying happened to arrive by taxi. She was wearing blue jeans and a white hoodie, looking youthful and radiant.\n\nThough she had been in a deep sleep for two hundred years, her age still remained in the bloom of her youth.\n\n\"Boss.\" Bai Yingying greeted Zhou Ze from across the road.\n\n\"So, wild ones sure know how to stir up trouble.\" Old Dao sniffed, looking at Bai Yingying walking towards them from the opposite side of the road, and sighed, \"Domesticated ones are more sensible.\"\n\nThe situation was now clear: the mastermind behind the murders was very likely a zombie. And in the bookstore, there just happened to be a domesticated zombie—Bai Yingying.\n\nOld Dao had personally seen Bai Yingying responsible for cleaning and greeting guests. After work, she even had to accompany the boss to sleep. Truly the most dedicated employee of the new era, new century.\n\n\"Boss, is the situation serious?\" Bai Yingying walked over and asked. She knew that if the matter wasn't difficult to a certain extent, her boss wouldn't specifically call her.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Old Dao, \"Tell her the situation.\" Then, Zhou Ze hailed a taxi, and they all got in.\n\nThe car drove to the villa area. After getting out, the three walked directly towards Wang Ke's villa.\n\nThey rang the doorbell, and soon, Wang Ke opened the door, gesturing \"Please\" to Zhou Ze and the others.\n\n\"The soup will be ready soon. Let's all have some. We shouldn't neglect our bodies even when busy with work.\"\n\n\"This humble Daoist agrees with what you said, sir.\"\n\nOld Dao was overjoyed. He had only eaten half of his late-night snack before having to pay and rush back to the hospital with Zhou Ze. His stomach wasn't completely full yet.\n\nThey sat down in the living room. Wang Ke came over with a tray, carrying four bowls of meat soup. Zhou Ze, Old Dao, and Bai Yingying each received a bowl, and he took one himself.\n\nThe meat soup was pure, sprinkled with green onions, and a drop or two of sesame oil. Each bowl also had two or three pieces of meat. Old Dao didn't stand on ceremony; he picked up his bowl and started eating immediately, enjoying it thoroughly.\n\nWatching Old Dao heartily drinking soup from his bowl, Zhou Ze sat beside him, shaking his head slightly. For some reason, waves of nausea swelled in his stomach. Even though the soup in front of him hadn't been touched, the urge to vomit was incredibly strong.\n\nBai Yingying also didn't eat; the soup in front of her remained untouched.\n\n\"Ha, that was satisfying!\"\n\nOld Dao wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. Seeing Zhou Ze hadn't picked up his chopsticks, he asked with some surprise:\n\n\"Boss, have some, warm yourself up.\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry, you eat,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, how could I?\" Old Dao demurred.\n\n\"Eat, don't waste it.\"\n\nSaying this, Zhou Ze even pushed the bowl of meat soup that was in front of Bai Yingying towards Old Dao.\n\n\"Haha, then I'd be rude to refuse. Mr. Wang's cooking, truly impeccable.\"\n\nOld Dao began to eat heartily once more.\n\nZhou Ze felt he couldn't watch any longer. He stood up and looked at Wang Ke, \"Let's talk about the case.\"\n\nWang Ke nodded, put down his bowl and chopsticks, and stood up, signaling Zhou Ze to follow him into the study.\n\nOn the desk in the study, there were many documents.\n\n\"Here, these are the photos that just arrived. The bodies that were already dissected are fine, nothing untoward happened, but a few bodies that hadn't been dissected yet have undergone abnormal changes. The corpses turned into pus, and also showed some emergency reactions impossible for dead people. For example, suddenly sitting up on the stretcher, and some people heard walking sounds coming from inside. When I received these reports, I immediately thought of you.\"\n\nWang Ke placed a stack of photos in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze flipped through the photos while asking:\n\n\"Any other leads?\"\n\nZhou Ze already knew about the events in the photos; he had personally experienced them just now.\n\n\"The police investigated the identities of all the deceased. There weren't many surprises; the victims were basically all people connected to that hospital. Therefore, the police's line of thought is that this is a revenge killing, and the perpetrator committed such an utterly deranged act with the sole purpose of retaliation. The police are now focusing on suspects who had medical disputes with this hospital. However, this matter is truly surprising. This hospital cannot stand up to scrutiny, and with such a serious malicious incident occurring, some things simply cannot be covered up. Gambling, using human lives as a gambling game—that's truly shocking.\"\n\nWang Ke reached out and adjusted his glasses, while also twirling the pen in his hand.\n\n\"Anything else?\" Zhou Ze continued to ask.\n\nSo far, all the intelligence Wang Ke had obtained was already known to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Nothing else. To pinpoint the killer's identity, we first need to root out this entire underground black industry chain. Then, from those who lost money gambling, we'd start by investigating local or provincial gamblers. Additionally, the families of those sent there to be used as gambling tools are also key suspects. This means the current number of suspects is truly enormous, and the investigation will be difficult and time-consuming. I'm still waiting for more specific information.\"\n\nZhou Ze was getting a little impatient. He stood up, preparing to leave. The information Wang Ke provided had no value to him.\n\n\"Don't go yet, stay a bit longer.\"\n\nWang Ke tried to keep him.\n\n\"Have some more soup.\"\n\n\"Then there's really nothing left to talk about,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n*If you mention drinking soup again, I'll have to leave.*\n\n\"Actually, there's one more thing—something the police didn't discover, but I did.\"\n\nWang Ke leaned back in his chair, looking at Zhou Ze. His gaze, hidden behind his glasses, seemed profound. \"But I'm afraid you'll misunderstand me.\"\n\n\"You don't have to say it.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't press him. To be honest, this matter was something he could manage or not. He was just a ghost messenger, not a Celestial Master from Mount Longhu, and he didn't have much of a passion for saving all living beings.\n\nWild zombies, by rights, were not under Zhou Ze's jurisdiction, unless that zombie was foolish enough to attack the Late Night Bookstore.\n\nOtherwise, he could completely stay in the bookstore, eating and sleeping as he pleased.\n\nMoreover, even if that zombie truly went crazy and actively came to the bookstore, with himself, Bai Yingying, and Miss Tang, the unfortunate one in the end would probably still be that zombie.\n\n\"I'll tell you anyway.\"\n\nWang Ke took out another photo from the drawer, turned it around, and placed it in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe background of the photo was a hospital sign, the very hospital where the incident occurred. Zhou Ze also saw the familiar large clock behind the hospital.\n\n\"There are a total of seventeen people in the photo: four security guards, four nurses, three doctors, and two administrative staff. Standing at the very front are four people. The two in the middle are the hospital's investor and a person in charge of that gambling platform, respectively. The one on the far left is a well-known, retired old doctor from Tongcheng. Among the hospital deaths, the four security guards, four nurses, three doctors, and two administrators died on that very day. However, among the four people in the front row, two died successively a week ago. For instance, this hospital investor was involved in a car accident a week ago, and this old doctor was found dead at home three days ago. Just got the news, this gambling platform boss died tonight while trying to escape...\"\n\nWang Ke sighed as he spoke.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, placed his hand on the photo, and then gently pushed away Wang Ke's index finger that was resting on it.\n\n\"I'm curious, is this fourth person not dead yet?\"\n\nWang Ke slowly moved his finger away. The face of the fourth person, previously covered by his finger, was revealed.\n\nA very familiar face.\n\nIt was Wang Ke's face!\n\nZhou Ze looked up at Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke spread his hands, \"Calm down, let me explain.\"\n\n\"Quite surprising,\" Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"Don't jump to conclusions. This really has nothing to do with me. This boss was my college roommate. He said he was opening a clinic and invited me to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony. I couldn't possibly refuse him. In fact, my role, just like that old doctor's, was merely to make up the numbers that day. What schemes they were involved in, like using human lives for gambling, I genuinely had no idea. After the opening, I never went to that hospital again, nor did I gain any benefits from it, and I have absolutely no connection to this matter.\"\n\nWang Ke looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"In fact, you can hardly imagine how profitable this black industry chain is. Even skimming off a thin layer of profit from it would be an enormous sum. If I were truly involved, would I still be worrying about money for the development of my psychological research firm? During Mr. Zheng's daughter's incident last time, you could see I was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan*. I lack money, and if I had been involved in this, would I still need to be running around for Mr. Zheng, acting like a subservient grandson*?\"\n\nWang Ke's words made a lot of sense.\n\nBecause he couldn't have predicted what was happening now and started acting in front of Zhou Ze in the past.\n\n\"So, you called me here, to consult on this case and show me evidence, and that was just a pretense?\" Zhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring, then flicked the ash, watching the embers fall onto the study carpet, and slowly said:\n\n\"Your real purpose was actually that you were afraid of death, and wanted me to protect you?\"\n\n\"Don't make me out to be so pathetic,\" Wang Ke took off his wire-rimmed glasses and rubbed his brow, saying, \"The psychological profile I created, the final portrait I drew, really resembles you. I called you here to be honest with you because I think those people might have been killed by you. Your identity... well, I know it too. If it was you, wouldn't it be simpler for me to just call you over?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"I'm not that idle.\"\n\n\"If it wasn't you, then I might die tonight or tomorrow.\" Wang Ke shook his head, looking somewhat helpless.\n\n\"I'll stay until tomorrow. You'd better pray the killer comes for you tonight.\"\n\nThe implication being,\n\n*If he misses the window, I won't wait around.*\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be Wang Ke's personal bodyguard.\n\n\"Where are your wife and daughter?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I told them to rest early upstairs. I didn't want to disturb them. Fortunately, the killer is currently only targeting the people in the photo, and hasn't shown any intention of wiping out entire families.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded at this.\n\nWalking out of the study, Zhou Ze saw Old Dao had eaten all three bowls of meat soup on the coffee table and was leaning back on the sofa, contentedly rubbing his belly.\n\n\"Was it good?\" Wang Ke asked Old Dao.\n\n\"Very delicious. The craftsmanship is superb, and the meat is very fragrant,\" Old Dao praised.\n\n\"Hehe, this is fresh pork my wife specially bought from a farmer's house today.\"\n\n\"That's thoughtful of her,\" Old Dao licked his lips.\n\n\"There's more in the pot. I'll warm it up again later.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful then!\" Old Dao clearly hadn't had enough. Once he digested a bit, he could eat more.\n\nJust then, a woman's voice came from upstairs:\n\n\"Darling, do we have guests?\"\n\n\"Yes, you go back to rest.\"\n\n\"Okay, darling, you finish up early and rest too. I'll clean the kitchen tomorrow.\"\n\nThe woman, after speaking from the stairwell, turned and walked back into the bedroom;\n\nShe lay down on the bed. It was a large red bed, looking very festive, though also a bit old-fashioned.\n\nNowadays, very few homes, even in rural areas, used such bright red bed sheets.\n\nMoreover,\n\nAt the edge of the bed sheet,\n\nDrops of crimson,\n\nwere falling down,\n\npooling into a puddle beneath the bed.\n\nDrip,\n\ndrip,\n\ndrip...\n***\n*   Lit. \"anxious like an ant on a hot pan,\" meaning extremely agitated or restless.\n*   Lit. \"act like a grandson,\" meaning to humble oneself excessively or be overly deferential.",

    "content": "Wang Ke's life was very boring and monotonous. He was a workaholic, constantly striving for his future, climbing up at all costs.\n\nPeople who were scared of poverty in childhood often develop a greater obsession with money when they grow up; they crave the sense of security that accumulating wealth brings.\n\nMoreover, it's hard for people born into normal families to understand the psychology of children who grew up in orphanages. What they lack is not as simple as \"financial security.\"\n\nThe former Zhou Ze was the same, but having lived a second life, Zhou Ze had become much lazier and much more open-minded.\n\nThere's no obsession that \"dying once\" cannot solve.\nIf that doesn't work,\nthen die a few more times,\nand you'll become open-minded.\n\nWang Ke suggested playing poker. Zhou Ze was noncommittal, Bai Yingying scorned it, and Old Dao wanted to join in, but two people couldn't really play poker, so they had to give up.\n\nIn the end, Wang Ke directly took out his patients' medical records for research, immediately starting work. It wasn't clear how terrified he actually was.\n\nZhou Ze looked at this \"brother\" who grew up with him in the orphanage, as if seeing his past self.\n\nEven before death, they wanted to possess more, pursue more. Everyone enjoyed the thrill that work brought, that accumulation and satisfaction like a squirrel hiding nuts in its tree hollow.\n\nNo matter if there was a tomorrow or not, one must work.\n\nOutside the window, light began to appear. A night, just like that, passed—somewhat slowly, yet also somewhat quickly. That zombie didn't come, no one knocked on the door, nor did anyone break a window. Tonight was very peaceful.\n\nZhou Ze deliberately waited a bit longer. It wasn't until morning that Zhou Ze decided to get up.\n\n\"Let's leave it at that for today. I'm going back.\"\n\nWang Ke didn't shamelessly beg Zhou Ze not to leave and continue protecting him. He lowered his head, continuing to look at his medical records. When Zhou Ze bid farewell, he finally raised his head, stretched wearily, and smiled at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Have breakfast before you go.\"\n\nOld Dao really wanted to nod, but he had to read Zhou Ze's expression. Anyway, for Old Dao, he was extremely satisfied with the Wang family's food—delicate and exquisite, focused on culinary enjoyment rather than simply filling one's stomach.\n\n\"No, it's fine, don't trouble yourselves.\"\n\nZhou Ze regarded anything related to \"eating\" from the Wang family with a respectful but distant attitude.\n\nHearing this, Old Dao was a bit disappointed. Actually, he had a good appetite yesterday, eating so many strange things, and surprisingly didn't get a stomach upset.\n\n\"Are the guests leaving?\"\n\nJust then, Wang Ke's wife came down the stairs.\n\nShe was wearing a black nightgown, and because guests were present, she had additionally put on a white outer garment, but her attractive figure was still discernible.\n\nThe young, charming woman exuded allure.\n\nBai Yingying stood by Zhou Ze and gently tugged his arm. Zhou Ze followed her direction and looked, seeing a series of red marks on Wang Ke's wife's left calf.\n\nIt was like blood, winding down along a stream's path from deep within a dense jungle, leaving traces of how time had worn it down.\n\n\"Darling, last night when I was asleep, I actually knocked over my bottle of red nail polish but didn't notice! When I woke up this morning and saw that puddle of red on the floor, it scared me half to death. I recently watched a horror movie, you know, I even thought you were like the male lead in the movie and ate me while I was asleep.\"\n\nWang Ke's wife walked up to Wang Ke, reached out, and caressed his chin. Her husband hadn't slept all night; she felt a little heartache for him.\n\n\"You're too thin, I wouldn't be full,\" Wang Ke chuckled in response. \"Go make breakfast.\"\n\n\"No need, sister-in-law,\" Zhou Ze refused again. \"We're leaving now. If anything happens, you can come find me at my bookstore. Oh, and my bookstore has moved to South Street now, it's not far from here.\"\n\nZhou Ze's meaning was that if they really sensed something amiss, they could come to his bookstore for refuge.\n\nThis was the most Zhou Ze could do. He couldn't stay by Wang Ke's side 24 hours a day, protecting him unfailingly. Besides, today was Qingming Festival, precisely when his bookstore's \"business was good.\"\n\nMany new customers would flock to the bookstore due to the arrival of Qingming Festival. This was a big business opportunity, similar to peak season, and Zhou Ze didn't want to miss it.\n\nDeclining the Wang couple's attempts to make them stay, Zhou Ze and the other two walked out of the Wang family villa.\n\nJust as they walked out, Zhou Ze stopped and looked back at the balcony.\n\nWang Ke's daughter should still be asleep. It was a Qingming Festival holiday, so she didn't have to go to school.\n\nThe little loli should not have returned yet, or she might not be able to come back at all. In fact, if the little loli had returned, Wang Ke's worries would probably be superfluous. If that zombie truly wanted to come to the Wang family for revenge, it would likely have gone but not returned.\n\n\"Boss, was that really red nail polish?\" Bai Yingying asked from behind Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Or maybe it was menstrual blood, and she was embarrassed, so she found an excuse.\"\n\n\"............\" Bai Yingying.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of a question, looked at Bai Yingying, and said, \"Yours should have ceased, right?\"\n\n\"............\" Bai Yingying.\n\nHow could she possibly answer that? And besides, how would a zombie have something like that!\n\nThe three walked to the community entrance. Because it was morning, it was quite lively there, and many stalls on the street had already opened.\n\nNo matter if any malicious incidents had recently occurred, people's lives always had to go on.\n\nA middle-aged man with all his limbs intact knelt on the ground, holding a bowl, begging there. He looked rather pathetic; his clothes were filthy, and he kept making \"ahh ahh ahh\" sounds with his mouth, like a mute.\n\nWhen Old Dao passed by, the beggar reached out and grabbed Old Dao's trouser leg, signaling Old Dao to give him some alms. Old Dao, after all, was dressed like a religious ascetic, and seemed easier to con money out of.\n\nBegging was also a profession that required rich experience, and one that knew how to distinguish and prioritize its target clients.\n\nWho knew Old Dao simply flicked his sleeve, blocking the beggar's grasping hand, and at the same time spat at the beggar, cursing:\n\n\"You have hands and feet, you're younger than this humble Daoist! What's wrong with doing something else? Why do you have to beg here? You've completely shamed your ancestors!\"\n\nGiven Old Dao's age and status, saying these words was perfectly justified.\n\nHe was already so old, yet still had to do live streams and serve ghosts. He was quite frugal normally, but Zhou Ze had heard Bai Yingying say that Old Dao seemed to be sponsoring several poor students in mountainous areas.\n\nHearing this, the beggar seemed quite enraged and humiliated. He immediately stood up, only to hear him let out a shriek, then fall to the ground, flailing his limbs continuously and shouting \"Ahh ahh ahh ahh!\"\n\nThe direct implication was that Old Dao had hit him; the unspoken meaning was that he wanted to extort money.\n\nOld Dao saw this scene and was so angry he almost laughed, wishing he could really go up and punch this rascal a few times.\n\nOf course, people also began to gather around. Everyone came with a mindset of watching the show, and no one spoke up for or stood up for this beggar.\n\nIn this day and age, everyone's sympathy had long been nearly exhausted by beggars and scammers, one after another. Sympathy for the weak is human nature, but these days, sometimes people who appear to be \"weak\" often turn out to be the opposite; perhaps their lives are even better than those who sympathize with them.\n\nZhou Ze, however, frowned slightly. He didn't want to waste any time on such matters and gave Bai Yingying a meaningful look.\n\nBai Yingying understood and approached the crowd.\n\nThe beggar only felt a bone-chilling cold beneath him. He immediately jumped up and shouted, \"I'm freezing to death, I'm freezing to death!\"\n\nHe could speak now, and immediately, uproarious laughter erupted from the crowd. Although they didn't know why, everyone found it amusing.\n\nThe beggar ran off dejectedly.\n\nOld Dao sniffed, sighed, and said, \"Some people deserve to be poor.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and didn't mention that he had previously seen an iPhone X in the beggar's pocket.\n\nThe three made do with breakfast at the community entrance. Bai Yingying thoughtfully brought sour plum juice. This time Zhou Ze ate a bit more; he hadn't eaten a single bite of supper last night and indeed needed to eat to replenish his energy.\n\nAfter eating, Bai Yingying prepared to take a taxi back to the bookstore.\n\nJust then, an old man with a head full of white hair and a hunched back walked past the three of them. The old man held a bag in his left hand and a plastic bag in his right, looking like he had just returned from grocery shopping.\n\nWhat made people notice was that the old man's left hand, holding the bag, only had two fingers. This was a genuine disabled person.\n\nOld Dao saw this scene, took the initiative to walk forward, and asked if he needed help.\n\nThe old man shook his head, signaling that he didn't need any.\n\nOld Dao said, \"Brother, it's fine. You live in this community, right? I'll help you carry it back.\"\n\nBut the old man still persistently smiled and shook his head, indicating he could manage. His own business, he could do himself, and didn't need help, even though it indeed looked very strenuous for him to carry things with just two fingers.\n\nThe old man walked forward; he probably lived in the same community as Wang Ke.\n\nOld Dao let out a long breath and said, \"People are indeed different. A young person with all his limbs intact kneels on the ground, wanting to beg for something for nothing, asking for free food. But this disabled older brother, a full cycle older than me, still maintains his dignity and pride. Let's drink a toast! This morning's 'chicken soup,' how satisfying. I feel like today is another day full of vitality and positive energy.\"\n\nOld Dao was there, muttering to himself and feeling self-satisfied. This was a common state for everyone who had drunk \"chicken soup,\" as if their souls had been purified in an instant.\n\n\"He dropped something,\" Zhou Ze spoke up to remind him.\n\n\"What, did he drop his wallet? Then I should quickly return it to him. He's so old, it's indeed easy for him to forget things, and his memory won't be good. It's not easy for him.\"\n\nOld Dao said this while looking at Zhou Ze, then he froze, and a look of horror appeared on his face;\n\nOnly to see Zhou Ze holding a middle finger joint, its tip still stained with blood, and even faint wisps of heat rising from it. It was truly very fresh.\n\n\"You're right, when people get old, their memory gets bad.\nEven when a finger falls off,\nthey don't even notice.\"",

    "content": "\"Thump, thump, thump... thump, thump, thump...\"\n\nOutside, there was a knocking sound. Wang Ke, still sitting on the living room sofa, raised his head, straightened his clothes, and walked to the entrance. He glanced at the monitor; the outdoor camera showed a stooped old man.\n\nThe old man had his head lowered, so his true face couldn't be seen clearly.\n\nWang Ke wasn't planning on opening the door.\n\nBut then, with a \"click,\"\n\nthe door opened.\n\nWang Ke stepped back. The old man appeared in the doorway.\n\nA chilling wind swept in from the doorway, and the surrounding temperature slowly dropped.\n\nWith a \"thud,\"\n\nthe plastic bag the old man was carrying fell, scattering some pickled vegetables, scallions, ginger, and garlic.\n\n\"We'll cook later.\"\n\nThe old man's voice was somewhat thick, not the sweet thickness of a young girl's voice, but more like a sound produced from a throat full of fluid.\n\nWang Ke took a deep breath. At that moment, he was even calm enough to take off his glasses, wipe them, put them back on, and say:\n\n\"While I know the chances of convincing you aren't high, I still have to try. I truly have no connection to that hospital.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe old man responded, then raised his head. His skin began to wrinkle at this point; previously, it only had some age spots, but now it had completely shriveled into dry elm bark.\n\nIt was rough, cracked, and his eye sockets had sunken in. In his hollow eyes, a green flame seemed to flicker.\n\n\"Who cares?\"\n\nThe old man took a step forward, closing the distance between himself and Wang Ke.\n\n\"If others don't care about the worthless lives of people like us, why should I care about anyone else's life?\"\n\nWatching the old man close in step by step, Wang Ke sighed, \"I consider myself a good person, and I deeply sympathize with what you've gone through.\n\nAlthough I don't know exactly what happened to you...\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nWang Ke's rambling wasn't even finished when he was flipped onto the ground. The old man's strength was immense, so much so that Wang Ke, an adult man, was like a chick in front of him.\n\nThis fall was truly severe. Wang Ke's left arm was directly fractured, and he didn't know how many ribs in his chest were broken.\n\n\"Sorry, I'm not a police officer, and when I do things, I don't care about evidence.\"\n\nThe old man squatted down beside Wang Ke.\n\n\"In short, everyone in that photo, everyone connected to that hospital, must die.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the old man reached out and patted Wang Ke's face. The old man was missing several fingers, and green pus continuously oozed from the broken areas, looking quite disgusting.\n\nWang Ke let out a long breath. Enduring the intense pain, he seemed to have resigned himself to his fate.\n\nJust then, the old man looked up at the stairwell. Wang Ke's wife was standing there, staring blankly at everything below. The woman had changed out of her pajamas and was now in sportswear, looking as if she had originally intended to go for a morning run.\n\n\"Go back and sleep soundly. I don't kill women.\"\n\nThe old man grinned, stood up, reached down, and dragged Wang Ke by the ankle. He walked in front, with Wang Ke being dragged behind, and the two of them entered the kitchen together.\n\nWang Ke's wife came down from upstairs and stood at the kitchen doorway.\n\nThe old man looked at the woman at the doorway with some surprise. He seemed to have prepared for a confrontation, but he had expected the woman to call the police, which she didn't.\n\nHe had expected the woman to grab something and fight him desperately to save her husband, but she didn't do that either.\n\nIn fact, the old man found any reaction from the woman—screaming, crying, begging, running away—understandable. But her next action was utterly astonishing.\n\nThe woman paused at the kitchen doorway for a moment, then turned around, brought in the pickled vegetables and other ingredients the old man had brought, proactively took out various seasonings from a small kitchen cabinet, and began to wash pots and bowls for the old man.\n\nLying on the floor, Wang Ke saw this scene, reached up to wipe his face, and said with some helplessness:\n\n\"Wife, you're acting up again.\"\n\nThe old man was also bewildered by the woman's actions. Since he couldn't figure it out, he stopped thinking about it. He lifted Wang Ke, pressed his neck into the sink, turned on the faucet, and began to rinse him with cold water.\n\nMeanwhile, the woman picked up a knife, not to attack the old man, but to help him chop garlic and scallions at lightning speed, showcasing her culinary skill. At the same time, she also opened the gas valve, poured oil into the wok, and lit the flame.\n\nIt was already quite clear what the old man had brought all these ingredients for, and the woman was acting as if she were assisting him.\n\nIn the kitchen, everything was harmonious, with everyone performing their assigned tasks. Everyone was preparing to cook a delicious dish, and working hard towards that goal.\n\nWang Ke didn't resist either. He knew he couldn't resist anymore.\n\nThe old man reached out, grabbed Wang Ke's hair, and lifted his head. Then, the old man's fingernails repeatedly glided across the skin on Wang Ke's face.\n\nLike a customer at a butcher shop, choosing which cut of meat would be best.\n\n\"First stir-fry, then stew the bones for soup. It'll be delicious.\"\n\nWang Ke's wife stood nearby and told the old man. She spoke very seriously, indicating she had given it careful thought. At the same time, she swallowed, a little hungry.\n\nThe old man seemed to have grown somewhat accustomed to this eccentric victim's wife. He actually pondered for a moment and finally agreed with Wang Ke's wife's suggestion.\n\nThe old man was about to cut the meat with his fingernails, but Wang Ke's wife proactively handed him a cleaver, gesturing for him to use it.\n\nShe pointed at the old man's fingernails and said, \"Dirty, unsanitary.\"\n\nA housewife with rich kitchen experience knows that the freshness of ingredients often determines the quality of a dish. Ingredients must be handled with the utmost rigor and care, ensuring no external factors affect their texture or flavor. This is a responsibility to oneself and to one's family.\n\nAs for the old man, who had already become a corpse demon, he had \"consumed\" over a dozen people from the hospital to replenish himself, making him quite the gourmet in this regard.\n\nHe knew well that differences in a person's gender, age, occupation, and physique often determined variations in the dish's flavor. The old man favored Wang Ke; he had plenty of lean meat, was nearing middle age and not overly fatty, and possessed well-developed bones, making him very suitable for consumption.\n\nThis was a gift from nature, and the old man clearly knew the secret to cooking this dish. This was the last person he planned to kill, so he intended to treat himself in a more ceremonious manner.\n\nHe believed that by doing so, he could soothe the anger and sorrow he had experienced before his death. This was the magical effect of food.\n\nThe green flame in the old man's eyes flickered. He took the knife, but with few fingers, his grip was somewhat unsteady. Still, he managed to grasp the handle with his remaining fingers.\n\nWang Ke was thrashing, so the old man had no choice but to strike the back of Wang Ke's head with the blunt side of the knife. Wang Ke immediately fainted, just like stunning a fish before cleaning it.\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe old man's knife descended!\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nA sharp sound,\n\nthe knife flew from the old man's hand. A long tongue, appearing from nowhere, lashed out like a whip, striking the old man's wrist and sweeping the knife away.\n\nWang Ke's wife turned her head and looked behind her.\n\nThe old man also looked at the kitchen doorway. Standing there was a little girl.\n\nThe little girl had her mouth open, half of her tongue still hanging out. The cleaver lay at her feet. Her eyes gleamed with a menacing aura, but one hand was already gripping the doorframe to support her body. Clearly, she was at the end of her tether, already tottering.\n\nWang Ke's wife looked at the little girl, waved gently, and said:\n\n\"Rui Rui, you're awake! Come, go brush your teeth and wash your face. You can have some soup later.\n\nIt's soup made from Daddy's meat, oh, it's very delicious! The bowl is full of rich fatherly love.\"\n\nThe little girl gave the woman in front of her a complicated glance. The woman was still there, excitedly beside herself.\n\nThe old man tilted his head slightly, staring at the little girl.\n\n\"The Underworld has its order; the Yellow Springs can be crossed!\"\n\nThe little girl forced herself to rally,\n\nand her tongue extended out again.\n\n\"The mortal world is not a place for rogue spirits like you to run wild! You are merely a corpse demon, not yet qualified to escape!\"\n\nThe tongue shot out again, hitting the old man's chest.\n\nWith a loud \"crack,\"\n\nthe old man's chest instantly caved in. He was sent flying backward, crashing into the tiled wall, which now had a dent and a large section of cracks behind him.\n\nBut the old man, with a gaping hole in his chest, slowly got up again.\n\nHis fingernails were long and black, and pus began to drip from the corners of his mouth. Still, he stood up again and continued to look at the little girl:\n\n\"There really is... the Yellow Springs?\"\n\nThe old man seemed a little lost.\n\nHe seemed to be thinking of his loved ones.\n\nEveryone has a Yellow Springs complex,* because everyone, in the process of growing up, will eventually experience the departure of their dearest relatives.\n\nThe Yellow Springs, in the eyes of Chinese people, is a place to entrust one's sorrow.\n\nThe little girl's tongue extended out again, but it was clear that this time, the force was much weaker than before.\n\nThe old man stretched out both hands and grabbed the tongue. Though his body shook, he wasn't flung back again. Immediately after, his fingernails began to frantically cut the long tongue.\n\n\"Thwip!\"\n\nThe tongue snapped.\n\nThe little girl collapsed to her knees, her body spasming. The light in the depths of her eyes flickered between clear and hazy.\n\nShe had barely managed to escape from Rong City,\n\nand now, unexpectedly, an unformed corpse demon had attacked her home at this very moment!\n\nAt any other time, if a character like this dared to offend her, she would certainly make him utterly cease to exist!\n\n\"You're... an Underworld envoy? There really is an Underworld bureaucracy, and a Netherworld?\"\n\nThe old man looked terrifying, with a large hole in his chest and pus oozing all over his body. He first mumbled to himself, then began to roar like a madman:\n\n\"If there's an Underworld bureaucracy, if there's a Netherworld, then why haven't those who deserve to go to hell gone to hell?!\n\nThose evil people, those criminals, can still continue to harm people in the mortal world!\n\nI... I... I'll eat all of you! All you good-for-nothings, all you people who hold positions without doing any work,\n\nI'll chop you all up and throw you into the pot to boil!\"\n\nAs the old man spoke, he lifted the unconscious Wang Ke again. With a \"clatter,\" he swept aside the previous pot, and the blue flame on the gas stove was still flickering.\n\nThe old man grinned menacingly, making a gesture as if to shove Wang Ke's head into the flames.\n\nThe little girl struggled to lift her head,\n\nand chided:\n\n\"How much longer are you going to stand by and watch? I understand if you didn't want me to come back alive, but can you really just watch your childhood friend die?\"\n\n\"I truly didn't expect you were already back.\"\n\nFrom the entrance, Zhou Ze emerged. He walked up to the little girl, looking at her kneeling on the ground, her rear end sticking up.\n\nA low-level pleasure, peculiar to a low-level extra who couldn't last half an episode, inexplicably arose in his heart.\n\nIn short, it was a petty person gone wild with success!\n\nSo, you have your day too.\n\n\"Come here, let Uncle pat you.\"\n\nSaying this, Zhou Ze reached out and ruffled the little girl's head.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nso you actually have your day too.\n\nThe little girl bit her lip tightly, her eyes filled with shame and indignation. She bit out two words:\n\n\"Save him.\"\n\n\"You really see him as a father?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nZhou Ze knew she was injured, and she could have stayed upstairs, but she still appeared. It seemed his childhood friend wasn't entirely useless; he could actually make an Underworld envoy willing to risk her life to save him.\n\nAnd then, looking at himself,\n\nhe was now practically a living, breathing villain.\n\nHe even felt he was a real piece of work himself.\n\nTesting whether the little girl had returned was just a spur-of-the-moment idea, but if Zhou Ze had intervened earlier, Wang Ke wouldn't have suffered physically.\n\nZhou Ze felt somewhat dazed. People really do seem to change.\n\nHis old self, so kind, so eager to help others, with a doctor's heart like a parent's.\n\nHis current self, however, seemed much more selfish than before.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze couldn't afford not to be cautious. The little girl's existence was a lingering concern for him; he had to treat it with extreme care.\n\nThe old man, seeing Zhou Ze walk in, paused for a moment. But when he saw Zhou Ze ignoring him, only talking to the little girl and not even looking at him, he didn't hesitate. He continued to push Wang Ke's head towards the flames.\n\n\"Woof woof woof!\"\n\nA barking sound came from outside the kitchen window.\n\nImmediately after,\n\na slender white figure crashed directly through the window glass and flew in, knocking the old man to the ground. Wang Ke also rolled to the side, escaping the fate of being roasted, at least for now.\n\nThe old man quickly sprang up and lunged at the white figure. Immediately, dull thuds continuously echoed through the kitchen, as if two people were swinging sledgehammers and violently smashing things.\n\nNext,\n\nit was the battle between the domesticated and the wild.\n\n---\n*   **Yellow Springs complex**: This refers to a deep-seated belief or emotional connection to the concept of the Yellow Springs (underworld), often linked to the grief and longing for deceased loved ones.",

    "content": "For a very long time, Zhou Ze hadn't seen Bai Yingying fight. Bai Yingying's daily work was actually just cleaning, being a salesclerk, playing PUBG, and sleeping beside him.\n\nBut Zhou Ze never forgot the scene when he and Xu Qinglang first seriously faced Bai Yingying after she woke up.\n\nWhy was Bai Yingying so well-behaved?\n\nIt was because he had utterly subdued her.\n\nBut this didn't mean she had truly become a little quail; for example, the last time Zhou Ze saw Bai Yingying playing games, her true nature was not that of a soft girl.\n\nZombies, after all, are zombies. Some fierce factors, branded deep in their bones, would not be erased, just as Zhou Ze himself wasn't really aware of what he would do after \"blacking out from drinking.\"\n\nIf zombies were truly docile and gentle babies, Madam Bai wouldn't have specifically instructed Zhou Ze to burn her corpse with bamboo during the next Cold Clothing Festival when she went to Hell.\n\nThat old man, called a \"corpse demon\" by the little loli, Zhou Ze didn't know what the term meant, but he could roughly deduce that it was probably inferior to a proper zombie.\n\nAt the very least, Bai Yingying wouldn't have her fingers suddenly break off just from holding a plastic bag, nor would she constantly ooze disgusting acidic fluid all over her body. If Bai Yingying were like that, Zhou Ze would rather continue sleeping in the freezer than have her sleep beside him.\n\nHe would even burn Bai Yingying without hesitation as a sacrifice to Heaven when the Cold Clothing Festival arrived.\n\nTherefore, this is, after all, a society that judges by appearance. Many people, after being hurt in a beauty contest, would grudgingly say a few words about \"inner qualities being the most important\";\n\nBut in reality, even if you're dead, having a good appearance is still a very important thing.\n\n\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\"\n\nA series of roars came from the kitchen,\n\nthe floor was cracked,\n\nthe walls were dented,\n\nthe duel between two corpses, both incredibly strong, naturally wouldn't be quiet. But it was clear that Bai Yingying had the upper hand, even with power to spare.\n\nMoreover, the old man had already been severely injured once by the little loli earlier.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nWith a loud bang, Bai Yingying directly slammed the old man onto the floor. For a moment, fluids splattered.\n\nThe old man's body was already battered beyond recognition, looking like the skeleton crew members often seen in *Pirates of the Caribbean*, with only a few scraps of flesh perfunctorily clinging to him.\n\n\"Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap!!!!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist, who had been watching from outside the entrance, finally walked in at this moment, applauding and cheering for Bai Yingying, shouting, \"Yingying, you're the fattest!\"\n\n\"Shasha...shasha...\"\n\nDragging the old man's body, Bai Yingying walked out of the kitchen. Several green streaks were left on the tiles where the old man had slid.\n\nBut he wasn't dead, truly not dead.\n\nSetting everything else aside, his sheer vitality alone was terrifying enough.\n\nAnd Bai Yingying was like a cute little puppy;\n\nat Zhou Ze's command,\n\nshe would rush out, pounce on the prey, then drag the prey back to Zhou Ze and present it.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down in front of the old man. He looked at the old man, and the old man was also looking at him.\n\n\"You...you're also a hell-runner...\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"A blind hell-runner...\"\n\nThe old man spat at Zhou Ze. If his chin hadn't been devoid of flesh, two globs of thick phlegm would surely have shot out.\n\n\"I've always been curious about something: that day at the hospital, were you also watching nearby?\"\n\n\"I wasn't there,\" the old man replied. \"So...the people in the hospital...were they...knocked out by you?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"Those people...are scum...\" the old man repeated.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Scum should be killed and eaten!\" the old man stubbornly stated. \"Heaven didn't let me die completely...it was to let me...let me clean up...clean them up.\"\n\n\"What about him?\" Zhou Ze pointed to Wang Ke, who was unconscious on the side.\n\nThe old man hesitated. After a good thrashing from Bai Yingying, his anger had significantly diminished.\n\nSo, when you're in a bad mood, you can go to a street billiards hall or dance hall, flick a wad of snot at those tattooed or rough-looking guys gathered there, and you'll immediately feel better.\n\n\"I don't know...\" the old man replied.\n\nThe fact that Wang Ke could still calmly explain himself in that situation, still articulating his thoughts when his life was threatened, really spoke volumes.\n\nEither this guy had long disregarded life and death and wasn't afraid of dying at all, or he simply had a clear conscience, willing to die but not willing to have a shit pot dumped on his head^1.\n\n\"But you still intended to kill him, boil him, and eat his flesh. You're addicted to eating people, aren't you?\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\nThe old man fell silent.\n\n\"You said Heaven didn't let you die completely, and for some unknown reason, turned you into this inhuman, ghoulish state, believing that Heaven is about to confer a great office upon this person^2.\n\nI also admit that the scum in that hospital, even I wanted them all to report to Hell early.\n\nBut you eventually developed a habit; you gradually stopped caring whether the people you killed were right or wrong, because you became infatuated with that feeling.\n\nI once heard a story about a prosecutor abroad. In his early years, he arrested some corrupt officials, which made him famous. Later, to maintain that feeling, he used illegal means and even deliberately framed some high-ranking officials to achieve his reputation. What I'm saying is, you're actually just like him.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and lightly patted the old man's face, then regretted his action a little and wiped his hand on the Old Taoist's pant leg.\n\n\"............\" The Old Taoist.\n\n\"When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you;\n\nIt's just that you haven't realized it yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up. \"Alright, you're tired of hearing so much, it's time for you to be on your way.\"\n\n\"I refuse to accept this... My family and I... The suffering... and persecution we endured... Why did no one... no one care... about my family and me...?\"\n\nZhou Ze made a cutting-off gesture and shook his head,\n\n\"I can guess that your story must be very sad and tragic, that you must have been poisoned by that hospital. When the story is told, those who hear it will surely be saddened.\n\nBut pity and suffering cannot be a reason for your violence,\n\nBecause there are countless pitiable people in this world, and countless people who have endured suffering;\n\nThe vast majority of people are overcoming hardships, facing new lives with a positive attitude.\n\nEven if some people give up on themselves because of it, that's just their own business; they don't go around harming others, they just bear their sorrow alone.\n\nSo, what makes you so special?\n\nThis is not a reason, and it never will be.\"\n\nHearing this, the old man remained silent.\n\n\"Therefore, the type of show I dislike the most is one where reporters interview murderers. In those shows, they are always repenting, always complaining about how miserable their past lives were, and how pitiable they are.\n\nEven the prison authorities and reporters will contact the victims' families, asking them to forgive the criminals so that the criminals can better reform and become new people.\n\nHow beautiful?\n\nHow touching?\n\nThey even have to strip away the victims' families' right to 'hate.'\n\nBut unfortunately, this show has remained quite popular, after all, there are really many people who like to shit from the moral high ground^3.\"\n\nAfter muttering to himself, Zhou Ze looked at the Old Taoist again: \"I've said so much, so I'll charge extra. Even high-end funeral homes nowadays offer psychological counseling services for families. Consider this an additional service. When you go down there, give me more joss paper money, got it?\"\n\nThe old man slowly closed his eyes and sighed.\n\n\"You still have a soul, right? Or some kind of consciousness cluster, since you're not a proper zombie. Now, float out of your body, and I'll send you to Hell.\"\n\nThe old man lowered his drooping hand, seemingly resigned to his fate. As for whether he had found any peace or understanding, Zhou Ze didn't know, nor did he care.\n\nHowever,\n\nin the next moment,\n\nthe old man's body suddenly convulsed, his almost broken neck actually lifted, and he bared his fangs, biting straight at Zhou Ze's body!\n\n\"Poof!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't move, but his fingernails directly pierced the old man's body. The black aura surrounding his fingernails began to rage wildly inside the old man's body. This was a torture that surpassed ordinary meaning, completely outdoing Bai Yingying's previous physical attacks on the old man.\n\nBefore the old man's mouth could bite Zhou Ze, he immediately began to wail. He was in great pain, extreme pain, and he was also pleading, begging Zhou Ze to withdraw his fingernails.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't move, calmly watching the old man suffer immensely in front of him.\n\nClearly, all of Zhou Ze's previous rambling and \"psychological counseling\" had been useless.\n\nThis also proved that the show exploring the pitiful and bright inner world of murderers was no bloody use. Many people have impulses and feelings of hatred, but normally, they wouldn't kill innocent people in the name of impulse and anger. Once they do that, they are no longer human; they are beasts.\n\n\"Actually, I'm not as disgusted with you as you might think,\" Zhou Ze said lightly. \"But you've lost control of yourself. You are ultimately not a knight who slays demons; in fact, you've become a demon waiting for a knight to slay.\"\n\nUnder the coercion of Zhou Ze's fingernails, a black orb of light drifted out from the old man's body.\n\nZhou Ze opened the gates of Hell,\n\nreached out, grabbed the orb of light, and threw it in.\n\nZhou Ze didn't scatter the old man's soul; he sent him to Hell, giving him a sliver of opportunity. This wasn't entirely because he begrudged the performance points, but because, at the hospital entrance back then, he himself had actually entertained the idea of borrowing a knife to kill and watching from the sidelines.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze habitually reached out and took out his little notebook. Then, Zhou Ze's eyes immediately widened!\n\nDamn!\n\nThe performance slip showed: Fifty percent!\n\nIn other words, this single performance from the old man was worth more than the sum of all the ghost performances he had sent down before!\n\nZhou Ze felt a little regret. He should have known not to rush him down; he should have first asked him if there were any other like-minded individuals, or if they were also hidden in this city.\n\nThe little loli, still kneeling on the ground on the side, watched Zhou Ze take out a little notebook, and a look of horror appeared on her face.\n\nThe shocking point wasn't just the document itself, but what that notebook represented!\n\nShe suddenly remembered what the Faceless Woman had told her at the Underworld Shop: in her eyes, the prey they were looking at was nowhere near as important as that guy from Tongcheng!\n\nAt this moment, Wang Ke's wife suddenly walked over with a knife, fork, and plate. She squatted down beside the old man's battered body, cut off a piece of flesh with the knife, put it on the plate, then inserted the fork into the meat, preparing to put it into her mouth.\n\nThe old man reacted quickly and stopped her. She was still struggling, shouting:\n\n\"Let me eat, let me eat, let me eat...\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the little loli's side, looked at the kneeling little loli, then looked at Wang Ke's wife, a hint of realization appearing in his eyes,\n\nand asked:\n\n\"Is your mom sick?\"\n\n---\n^1: \"have a shit pot dumped on his head\" (頭頂扣個屎盆子 – tóu dǐng kòu gè shǐ pén zi): An idiom meaning to be unfairly blamed, slandered, or have dirt thrown on one's reputation.\n^2: \"Heaven is about to confer a great office upon this person\" (天將降大任於斯人也 – tiān jiāng jiàng dà rèn yú sī rén yě): A classical quote from the Mencius, implying that one's hardships are a prelude to a great task or destiny.\n^3: \"shit from the moral high ground\" (站在道德制高點拉屎 – zhàn zài dào dé zhì gāo diǎn lā shǐ): A vulgar idiom describing someone who makes self-righteous or hypocritical judgments, often to criticize others from a position of perceived moral superiority.",

    "content": "The little loli turned her head slightly. She always felt that Zhou Ze deliberately said something ambiguous. She didn't answer; no matter if you answered \"yes\" or \"no\" to that question, it wouldn't be good.\n\nMoreover, the little loli believed Zhou Ze could see it too.\n\nYes, Zhou Ze saw it. All along, Zhou Ze had thought Wang Ke might have some peculiar habit. Now, it seemed it wasn't Wang Ke's problem, but Wang Ke's wife's.\n\nWang Ke was a psychologist; he was responsible for treating his wife's problem himself. He even had to deliberately go along with his wife's peculiarity while living at home.\n\nHe was acting, and the purpose of his performance was to make his wife happy.\n\nA successful grown man, every day at home, had to pretend to be very happy, constantly eating meat and drinking meat broth, and had to act as if he savored it.\n\nHis wife bought meat every day and watched her husband eat.\n\nFor others, it might be a form of torture.\n\n\"Tie her up. You watch her and make sure nothing happens to her,\" Zhou Ze told Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, walked straight over, and grabbed Wang Ke's wife, taking her into the study.\n\nOld Daoist didn't need to be told. He picked up the unconscious Wang Ke and placed him on the sofa, checking his injuries.\n\nZhou Ze didn't immediately call 120 to send Wang Ke to the hospital or his wife to a mental hospital. Regarding his wife's matter, Wang Ke should have the right to make his own choice. Zhou Ze saw no need to complicate his life or make decisions on his behalf. Besides, Zhou Ze was too lazy to take on this kind of trouble.\n\nAlthough Wang Ke was unconscious and injured, his problems weren't severe. He should wake up soon. At that point, he could make his own decisions.\n\nMoreover, at this moment, Zhou Ze still had something that needed to be resolved.\n\nHe picked up the little loli.\n\nThe little loli struggled.\n\nBefore, the little loli had also let Zhou Ze pick her up, but that was because she wanted to be \"at the same height\" as Zhou Ze. At that time, she carried dignity, restraint, and absolute dominance and control.\n\nBut now, the tables had turned¹. This time, when Zhou Ze picked her up, he purely treated her like a neighborhood little sister.\n\n*I'll rub,*\n\n*I'll pinch,*\n\n*See if you're still so cheeky.*\n\nZhou Ze carried the little loli upstairs.\n\nOld Daoist stood at the stairwell, watching Zhou Ze carry the little loli up.\n\nHis face showed some struggle, some conflict. He was considering whether to stop his boss from doing such a beastly thing.\n\nSo beastly!\n\nShe's just a child.\n\nIf Zhou Ze knew what Old Daoist was thinking right now, he'd probably relentlessly punch a few holes² through him.\n\nZhou Ze placed the little loli on the bed and stepped back. He saw that the little loli had fallen asleep the moment he picked her up and carried her upstairs. Now, lying on the bed, she let out soft, adorable \"snores,\" like a delicate piece of porcelain.\n\nA moment later, she rubbed her eyes, looking at Zhou Ze with some surprise. In a soft, sweet voice, she said:\n\n\"Uncle, why are you at my house? And in my room?\"\n\nSo cute, so adorable!\n\nBut Zhou Ze, like an insensitive brute, immediately picked the little loli up again, swinging her back and forth in his hands, and said:\n\n\"I don't care if you're pretending or not, it makes no difference to me. If you're pretending, stop it now. If you're not pretending, then regain your primary consciousness and wake up now.\n\nI have some things, some accounts, I need to settle with you properly.\n\nDon't overestimate my patience. I'm not some weird uncle who invites little girls home to look at goldfish³.\"\n\nZhou Ze swung and swayed. At first, the little loli cried and fussed, even starting to call \"Daddy, Mommy,\" but after a while, she quieted down. Her gaze was calm, and biting her tender red lips, she said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Put me down.\"\n\n\"Oh, still cheeky!\"\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nA slap landed on an unspeakable place⁴. The little loli's eyes widened. She twisted her head to glare at Zhou Ze, wishing she could devour Zhou Ze alive!\n\n*You dare to hit this venerable one's unspeakable place!*\n\n*And you still dare to say you're not a weird uncle?*\n\n\"Oh, sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze let go, and the little loli dropped onto the bed.\n\nBut the little loli was still glaring at him. Zhou Ze looked a bit sheepish and said:\n\n\"I was careless just now; I didn't notice you were back.\"\n\n\"Zhou Ze, do you think you can act with impunity now?\" the little loli reprimanded.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nThe unspeakable place received another heavy blow.\n\nThe little loli's face was filled with disbelief!\n\n*You just said it was carelessness, not intentional!*\n\nZhou Ze rubbed the palm of his hand, which had just slapped the unspeakable place, and said:\n\n\"This time it wasn't unintentional.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze also sat down by the bed.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Don't be like protagonists in movies who like to talk tough even when death is imminent, because I'm not the villain in a movie. I'm not willing to waste so much time talking nonsense with you.\"\n\n\"You dare to kill me?\" the little loli retorted.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nThree slaps on the unspeakable place.\n\nThe little loli's body trembled three times.\n\nHer pearlescent teeth were almost biting her red lips until they bled.\n\n\"A while ago, someone said the same thing to me, but in the end, she died. So, don't use that to threaten me, because it's useless.\n\nEven if you're hiding in this shell, I have ways to force you out.\"\n\n\"She was killed by you?\" The little loli knew who the person Zhou Ze killed was—no, more accurately, who that ghost was.\n\nZhou Ze had already killed one ghost messenger, so he wouldn't mind killing another.\n\n\"What do you want to ask? Speak.\"\n\nThe little loli rolled over and sat on the bed, hiding her unspeakable place.\n\nZhou Ze took out his credentials, held them in his hand, and asked, \"How exactly do ghost messengers get on duty? Am I considered on duty now?\"\n\n\"You have the credentials, and you have my Key to the Gate of Hell. You are a ghost messenger.\"\n\n\"Is the management this lax?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\n\"A ghost messenger is merely the lowest rank in the Underworld Bureau. The human world is so vast. If even the lowest-ranking ghost messengers required the Underworld Bureau's upper echelons to select and appoint them one by one, then the upper echelons of the Underworld Bureau wouldn't have time for anything else.\n\nEven Ghost Constables, who are above ghost messengers, don't require certification; they just need to obtain the corresponding qualifications. Only Inspectors, who come after them, must be personally certified by the Underworld Bureau.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. So the work environment is that lax. Doesn't that mean anyone who kills you can obtain ghost messenger status?\"\n\n\"The Underworld Bureau is orderly, the Yellow Springs can—\"\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nZhou Ze flipped the little loli over. Another whack on the unspeakable place!\n\n\"Why?!\" The little loli endured a terrible sense of humiliation.\n\n\"Speak properly. Stop shouting slogans,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"The Underworld Bureau has its rules. Killing a ghost messenger is a great taboo!\" the little loli replied.\n\n\"That sounds like nonsense. I killed one, and that one in Rongcheng must have killed one too. He's fine, so why am I also fine?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze raised his hand, ready for another whack.\n\nHmm,\n\nThe feel is good.\n\n\"That's because you didn't violate any rules. Moreover, the ghost messenger you killed already had an issue. Rather than a ghost messenger, she was more like a vengeful wandering spirit!\"\n\n\"Alright, let me summarize this to see if I'm right: does it mean that ghost messengers are the lowest-ranking small fry, and if they die or get a work-related injury, no one is held responsible? Even if their status is seized, as long as the successor doesn't act recklessly and even inherits the original work to continue as a ghost messenger, the Underworld Bureau won't care?\"\n\nThe little loli nodded.\n\n\"Honestly, being a civil servant like this is really uninteresting.\"\n\nZhou Ze pouted. Wasn't this just dampening his work motivation? He was still a temporary worker now, but now he knew that even if he became a regular employee, there were no guarantees. He suddenly felt that the future of this job was bleak.\n\nIn the human world, everyone fights tooth and nail to become civil servants precisely for an \"iron rice bowl\"⁵.\n\nBut in the Underworld, it's not an iron rice bowl. In fact, this rice bowl has to rotate.\n\n\"Ghost messengers are the best way for spirits to seek status in the Underworld Bureau. Moreover, the ghost messenger credentials aren't that easy to obtain. Generally speaking, it's almost impossible to inherit them.\"\n\nThe little loli focused her gaze on the credentials in Zhou Ze's hand again, pursed her lips, and continued:\n\n\"Throughout history, how many mountain and river gods, unable to take the great path of being officially bestowed and pardoned by orthodox dynasties, yet wishing for advancement, willingly became ghost messengers to take the path of the Underworld Bureau and Hell? That's the reasoning behind it.\"\n\n\"Alright, there's one more thing.\" Zhou Ze spread out his palm. \"This mark, can you take it back?\"\n\nThe little loli didn't make a sound.\n\n\"Answer me.\"\n\nZhou Ze's face slowly darkened.\n\nThe little loli nodded.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, slowly clenched his fists, and continued to ask in a soft, gentle voice:\n\n\"How do you take it back?\"\n\n\"Something I gave you, I naturally have my own way of taking it back.\"\n\n\"You're avoiding the question a bit.\" Zhou Ze reached out and rubbed the little loli's head. \"Come on, be a good girl, tell Uncle specifically: this imprint, this Key to the Gate of Hell you spoke of, what method is needed to take it back?\"\n\nThe little loli looked at Zhou Ze; she was hesitating.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his voice. At the same time, his fingernails lengthened, their tips lightly sliding across the little loli's face.\n\nThe little loli said in a low voice:\n\n\"Kill you, and it comes back.\"\n\nIt was the expected answer,\n\nBut it caused Zhou Ze's eyes to darken completely.\n\nHe wasn't angry,\n\nNor was he furious,\n\nAt least, he didn't show it. He just said calmly:\n\n\"So, the empty promises you made to me then, the promises you gave, and the future expectations you offered, were all fake.\n\nYou just needed to do business in Rongcheng, so you had me do your work to earn performance.\n\nWhen you came back,\n\nYou planned to kill me. In fact, I was part of your calculated performance,\n\nRight?\"\n\nThe little loli closed her eyes.\n\nTracing back in time, that day, Zhou Ze was still calmly watching Tang Shi and Old Daoist vent their anger over the Rongcheng matter, even making many gestures that ordinary people only made in agitation.\n\nAt that time, he could actually still calmly sip coffee!\n\nIf he had known then that if that one in Rongcheng lost, and when the little loli came back, he wouldn't just suffer losses, but would be completely finished⁶, would he have been able to calmly savor his coffee?\n\nPerhaps he would have been even crazier, buying tens of thousands of yuan worth of fireworks to set off.\n\nZhou Ze stuck out his tongue and licked his lips. He still looked calmly at the little loli, not frustrated and discomfited, not hysterical, but simply asked:\n\n\"Why didn't you go back to Hell? Was it because your injuries were too severe, so severe that you couldn't even return to Hell? Or even now, you don't dare to descend into Hell via the Yellow Springs Road⁷?\"\n\nThe little loli didn't answer. Silence, too, was a tacit agreement.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his credentials, glanced at them, and as if talking to himself, said, \"How much performance can you earn by sending a ghost messenger back to Hell?\"\n\n\"I am a ghost messenger. Sending me into Hell earns no performance,\" the little loli replied.\n\n\"Oh, sorry. I wasn't clear.\n\nWhat I meant was,\n\nDestroying a ghost messenger's credentials, tormenting her into a vengeful spirit without clear consciousness, and then sending her back to Hell,\n\nWould that earn performance?\"\n___\n¹ **风水轮流转 (fēngshuǐ lúnliú zhuǎn):** Literally \"Feng Shui takes turns.\" An idiom meaning that fortune or circumstances rotate; what goes around comes around; the tables turn.\n² **开几个天窗 (kāi jǐ gè tiānchuāng):** Literally \"open a few skylights.\" An idiom used humorously or menacingly to mean punching holes or making openings (usually in a person's body or head).\n³ **喊小姑娘回家看金鱼的怪叔叔 (hǎn xiǎo gūniáng huí jiā kàn jīnyú de guàishūshu):** Literally \"weird uncle who invites little girls home to look at goldfish.\" A common euphemism in Chinese popular culture for a predatory or perverted older man, similar to a pedophile.\n⁴ **不可知的位置/不可说位置 (bùkě zhī de wèizhì / bùkě shuō wèizhì):** Literally \"unknowable place\" or \"unspeakable place.\" A humorous euphemism, in this context, referring to the loli's bottom/buttocks.\n⁵ **铁饭碗 (tiě fànwǎn):** Literally \"iron rice bowl.\" An idiom referring to a secure, lifelong job, especially in the government or a state-owned enterprise, that guarantees stable income and benefits regardless of performance.\n⁶ **GG (gēgē):** Internet slang, short for \"Good Game,\" often used ironically to mean \"game over\" or \"completely finished/defeated.\"\n⁷ **黄泉路 (huángquán lù):** Literally \"Yellow Springs Road.\" Refers to the path to the underworld in Chinese mythology, similar to the River Styx in Greek mythology.

    "content": "The atmosphere in the bedroom immediately turned cold, and a grim, murderous aura slowly began to fill the space.\n\nWhile she's ill, take her life!¹\n\nWhat's more, between himself and Little Loli, it had been a life-or-death confrontation from the very beginning, and Little Loli herself was responsible for all of it.\n\nEliminate her, extract the last bit of valuable things—Zhou Ze felt no psychological burden whatsoever.\n\nLittle Loli looked at Zhou Ze, then slowly opened her mouth and said, \"Do you want to be a Butou?\"²\n\nPeople on the verge of death always subconsciously grab onto any straw they can to gain a sliver of hope for survival, and the Little Loli before him was no exception.\n\nShe knew Zhou Ze wanted to kill her, and also knew Zhou Ze wanted to use her to gain the last bit of profit and value; she proactively offered it.\n\nFurthermore, her original pride and courage had long since been completely shattered in that Mingdian³ in Rongcheng, on that night. Her physical injuries had indeed not recovered, but her spiritual wounds hadn't either.\n\nThat night, she knelt prostrate in the corner, watching her colleagues who came with her perish one by one, like fireworks. This scene almost overturned her original worldview.\n\nWhen he heard the two words \"Butou,\" Zhou Ze remained expressionless, just quietly sitting there.\n\nThe unspoken meaning was as if he was telling Little Loli: \"Please begin your performance.\"\n\nAnyway, listening or not, he wouldn't get pregnant.\n\n\"Do you know what the two basic conditions for becoming a Butou are?\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't answer, but slightly raised his hand, placed it to his nose tip, and sniffed at the scent.\n\nThe meaning was: don't shout slogans at me, and don't play preambles with me; speak properly, otherwise, I don't mind re-experiencing the wonderful sensation of an unknown location.\n\nAnyway, you're almost done for, and I can also strike while the iron's hot.\n\nLittle Loli took a deep breath. She wished she could tear Zhou Ze into ten thousand pieces right now, but the wheel of fortune turns.⁴ She had returned severely injured from Rongcheng; being lucky enough to survive was already remarkable. Now, she couldn't even deal with a single Shimei.⁵\n\nOthers are the cleaver and chopping block, I am the fish.⁶ The principle is that simple.\n\n\"There are two conditions for becoming a Butou: one is to meet the performance point target, the other is to have three other Guichai⁷ willing to become your subordinates, obey your commands, and serve you as Butou.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't speak.\n\n\"To serve you as Butou, they must willingly offer their soul blood to merge into your identity plate, allowing you to control their life and death, making betrayal impossible.\n\nFulfilling these two conditions allows one to advance to Butou. After that, one can then advance towards the position of XunJian.⁸\"\n\n\"Serve as Butou?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"If it's that simple, wouldn't you Guichai have already started fighting among yourselves?\"\n\nJust like Little Loli's frequent BGM slogan, \"The Underworld Bureau⁹ is orderly, the Yellow Springs are crossable,\" if Guichai had to go through this mode to become Butou, where a casual life-or-death confrontation could force others to become subordinates, wouldn't the entire Guichai community become a chaotic battleground for raising Gu?¹⁰\n\nHowever, in Zhou Ze's view, the Guichai community was actually quite peaceful; otherwise, Little Loli wouldn't have been able to summon so many Guichai to go to Rongcheng together that time.\n\n\"First, between Butou and Guichai, there is only a difference in status, not in strength. Only upon reaching XunJian can one possess the official sealed certificate of appointment from the Underworld Bureau, and only then truly have a status superior to both Guichai and Butou.\n\nSecond, as long as the Butou one serves is promoted to XunJian, the previous contract automatically disappears, and one can regain freedom.\n\nThird, you are currently coercing me. Although you are also a Guichai, your act of coercing a colleague has undoubtedly fallen into the Underworld Bureau's eyes. If you kill another Guichai who has caused problems, it's equivalent to solving trouble for the Underworld Bureau, and there will be no issue.\n\nBut if you kill me, it will definitely be recorded by the Underworld Bureau. You might think nothing of it now, but when you get promoted in the future, you will definitely encounter trouble. Furthermore, if you continue to indulge yourself freely, the Underworld Bureau will issue a warrant for your arrest, just like the one in Rongcheng last time.\"\n\n\"And thus, the serving relationship between Guichai indeed involves coercion and exchanges of interest, but rarely involves life-or-death, murderous coercion, because doing so is not worth it.\n\nWanting to be a Butou is to be qualified to become a XunJian, to gain an official position no longer as a Zaoli¹¹, to have one's own spiritual tablet¹² in the Underworld Bureau—even if it's the lowest tier, it's still a tablet. Therefore, not many madmen would be willing to use simple and crude methods to coerce other Guichai just to become a Butou.\"\n\nZhou Ze extended his little finger, picked his ear, and said, \"So, if I kill you, I'll still have trouble later?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"In other words, even if I become a Butou, because of today's incident, it'll be hard to become a XunJian, as you call it?\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\n\"Then why wouldn't I just kill you?\"\n\n\"You can use your performance, your actions, to erase the negative impact of your coercion today, and it's not entirely impossible to advance further. I can... help you.\n\nBecause as long as you don't get promoted, I must remain your subordinate, with my life and death in your hands.\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, pulled back the curtains, opened the French window, walked onto the balcony, and said, \"The first time I came here, when I walked out the door, you were standing here watching me, right?\"\n\nLittle Loli didn't know what Zhou Ze meant.\n\nZhou Ze's fingertips lightly tapped on the railing. He was hesitating, and also thinking.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze was a very conflicted person. He was a nobody, and had never denied being a nobody. He was in his previous life, and he was in this life too.\n\nThe contradiction of a nobody lies in this: while yearning for freedom, he also longed to realize his ambitions. While wanting to stand tall and admire the scenery, he also thought of kneeling to beg for progress.\n\nIf he were a ruthless hero, he would have unhesitatingly accepted Little Loli's suggestion, not caring if she wanted to kill him before. \"I only want the immediate benefits, I only want to pursue immediate progress.\"\n\nIf he were a liberal, like the one in Rongcheng, he wouldn't care; he would only care about his own carefree spirit. Even if he encountered suppression, he would disdain it. \"Either you kill me, or I kill you.\"\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was precisely in between the two.\n\n\"How about this, let's flip a coin?\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of a method, and pulled out a one-yuan coin from his pocket.\n\n\"Heads, I kill you; tails, I take you in.\"\n\nLittle Loli's eyes widened. She felt Zhou Ze was joking, was deliberately humiliating her, to actually entrust her life to something like a coin toss!\n\nAre you effing brain-dead?!\n\nLittle Loli roared in anger internally!\n\nHer ten jade-like fingers tightly clutched the bedsheet. She hated herself for being injured. Otherwise, she would definitely pull out the soul of the person before her and burn it a hundred times with hellfire!\n\n\"I've tossed it!\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed the coin. The coin spun continuously in the air. Little Loli's eyes were fixed on the coin until it landed.\n\nZhou Ze bent down, looking at the coin on the floor.\n\nIt was the \"tails\" side.\n\nLittle Loli let out a long breath of relief. Although this process was nonsensical, ultimately, she could live. Even if she was under someone's control, at least she could survive.\n\nMoreover, Little Loli had seen Zhou Ze's ghost plate. She clearly knew which shadow stood behind that ghost plate. Even if that shadow had dissipated untold years ago, once, that Mount Tai¹³ had been a colossal entity that suppressed hell!\n\nShe was willing to take a gamble. The future, in fact, wasn't entirely bleak. Because Zhou Ze didn't seem like someone without destiny. He was originally her predetermined performance target and stand-in, but after she returned from Rongcheng, she found that everything had changed. He had gained an identity, and controlled the situation.\n\nEven the appearance of the Shimei today also became an opportunity for him to force her to reveal herself, making it impossible for her to hide any longer.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the coin and smacked his lips, seemingly dissatisfied: \"How about, we flip it again?\"\n\nLittle Loli's eyes immediately turned red, her tongue extended out and coiled around her. She was going crazy. She was ready to fight!\n\n\"Don't get agitated, don't get agitated. I know your tongue is long and you're good with your mouth. Don't get agitated, alright, no more tossing, no more tossing.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Little Loli, slightly tilted his head, and took out his ID booklet.\n\nLittle Loli retracted her tongue, then slapped her forehead with one hand. Immediately after, a black luminous bead floated out from there and merged into Zhou Ze's ID booklet.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips. In the realm of the unseen, he felt as if another line had appeared in his heart, and this line was connected to Little Loli's life and death.\n\nLife and death, which he could decide with a single thought.\n\nLittle Loli got off the bed and slowly knelt down before Zhou Ze. It was a single-knee genuflection, with one hand resting on her knee and her head raised, performing the respectful bow of a subordinate to a superior.\n\n\"Lin Ke, greetings, Butou!\"\n\nLin Ke, should be the Guichai's name, while Little Loli's current body's name seemed to be Wang Rui.\n\nAt this moment, Little Loli, filled with anger and unwillingness, her prostrate body trembled slightly, but she could only resign herself to fate!\n\nZhou Ze looked at the Little Loli below him, slowly raised his head. The once arrogant, irritable, and cold Little Loli now surrendered at his feet. This upheaval, a complete reversal, was indeed very pleasant.\n\nJust then, Old Daoist walked up the stairs. Wang Ke was awake, and he came to inform the Boss.\n\nAs he just got upstairs, he gently pushed open the bedroom door, and his eyes immediately widened!\n\nHe saw Little Loli kneeling before Zhou Ze. Due to the obstruction of his view, Zhou Ze was blocking the view between Old Daoist and Little Loli, so in Old Daoist's line of sight, Little Loli was kneeling before the Boss, her body trembling slightly, while the Boss had his head raised, hands on his hips, looking very satisfied.\n\n\"Ugh...\" Old Daoist gasped sharply, not daring to make a sound. He immediately quietly and stealthily backed away, quickly descending the stairs, while quietly muttering, \"Good heavens! Really a beast! Three years minimum, three years minimum! The Boss is too much of a beast!\"\n\n---\n¹ **While she's ill, take her life!**: A Chinese idiom meaning to take advantage of someone's weakness to destroy them.\n² **Butou (捕頭)**: A rank within the Underworld Bureau, equivalent to a head constable or captain of ghost officers.\n³ **Mingdian (冥店)**: A store selling items for the deceased or related to the underworld.\n⁴ **The wheel of fortune turns**: A Chinese idiom meaning that fortunes or circumstances change over time.\n⁵ **Shimei (屍魅)**: A type of corpse wraith or charm.\n⁶ **Others are the cleaver and chopping block, I am the fish**: A Chinese idiom meaning one is at the mercy of others.\n⁷ **Guichai (鬼差)**: Ghost servants or ghost officers, low-ranking functionaries of the Underworld Bureau.\n⁸ **XunJian (巡檢)**: A higher rank within the Underworld Bureau, superior to Butou, equivalent to an inspector or patrol chief.\n⁹ **Underworld Bureau (陰司)**: The administrative body of the afterlife/netherworld.\n¹⁰ **Raising Gu (養蠱)**: A practice of putting venomous insects into a container to fight until only one remains, which absorbs the venom of the others.

    "content": "Wang Ke woke up. He was badly injured. When Zhou Ze came downstairs, Wang Ke was still lying on the sofa, his face a little pale, partly from fright and partly from his injuries.\n\n\"Need my help?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke shook his head, then said, \"As long as you help me...\"\n\n\"Oh, then I'll be going.\"\n\nZhou Ze saw Wang Ke shake his head and immediately turned to walk towards the entrance, as if he hadn't heard Wang Ke's earlier \"implication.\"\n\nWang Ke: \"...\"\n\nStepping out, Bai Yingying and the old Daoist also followed.\n\nActually, for Zhou Ze, the matter here was already resolved. The remaining issues, the little loli would help handle. Judging by the little loli's willingness to risk exposure to save Wang Ke, she still valued Wang Ke as a father.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze somewhat reflective. Of course, it wasn't about the sentiment of deep father-daughter affection.\n\nRather, the ghost messenger who possessed the sister-in-law last time also seemed to be influenced by the host, adopting the host's way of thinking, even going so far as to kill to fulfill the host's sister's unrequited love.\n\nAnd the little loli seemed to be the same, willing to risk danger to save her father. Zhou Ze didn't think Wang Ke's personal charm was so great as to reach such an extent.\n\nSo,\n\nDoes that mean that ghost messengers or high-level ghosts can possess a person's body, but at the same time inevitably suffer their influence?\n\nSo, was he himself also influenced?\n\nIt seemed that way for a while,\n\nFor example, that obsession that had troubled him for a long time:\n\n*She's not sleeping with me anyway, is she?*\n\nRight, that must have been him being influenced by Xu Le;\n\nHis normal self wouldn't have been filled with those lewd impulses.\n\nBut it seemed his influence wasn't as severe as that of the two ghost messengers possessing the little loli and the sister-in-law. There should be some implications and differences here.\n\nFor example, they might have kept the human host's soul intact for their convenience in entering and exiting hell, and so the body could continue to live when their souls left, making it easy for future use. But with two souls in one body for a long time, it's inevitable they'd be influenced.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze himself and Tang Shi, the original owners of their bodies were dead. With no original owner's soul getting in the way, the influence was naturally much smaller.\n\nEach had its pros and cons, he supposed.\n\nFor instance, Zhou Ze couldn't learn the little loli's:\n\n\"Biubiubiu\"\n\nAfter taking a taxi back to the bookstore, Zhou Ze yawned. He was a bit tired, but what surprised him was that there was still a customer in the bookstore.\n\nHe checked the time; it was already past two in the morning.\n\nIf it were a customer who could send him ghost money, Zhou Ze wouldn't have been surprised, but this was a living person.\n\nA girl in a white dress, sitting there reading a book and playing on her phone.\n\nShe looked to be around twenty-five or twenty-six, with a pleasant appearance. Her reading habit was somewhat unusual; she moved her lips as she read, as if silently reciting, a habit only common for elementary school students just learning texts.\n\nBai Yingying went to shower. She had battled that disgusting old man and hadn't been injured, but she was dirty. Having followed Zhou Ze for a long time, she had naturally picked up some habits.\n\nOne should know she was a zombie who had been lying underground for two hundred years. Zhou Ze didn't believe Madam Bai would periodically dig out her corpse for a bath or a spa treatment.\n\nThe old Daoist had gone out to buy late-night snacks. With Xu Qinglang not in the shop, everyone's meal situation was a bit worrisome. Usually, Xu Qinglang was responsible for all three meals.\n\nThinking of this, Zhou Ze felt a little sad,\n\nIf Xu Qinglang didn't come back soon,\n\nhis supply of good food would soon run out!\n\nNot rushing upstairs, Zhou Ze poured two cups of water and walked over to the girl, placing one cup in front of her, then sitting down on the sofa opposite.\n\nAlthough it was a bit regrettable that she wasn't a ghost, a guest was a guest, and he always had to offer some hospitality.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThe girl looked up at Zhou Ze, then lowered her head again to look at the article in her hand, slowly reciting it silently.\n\nZhou Ze originally thought this was just one of her reading habits, but slowly realized something was off; she wasn't just reciting silently, but doing so with emotion and feeling.\n\nSeemingly noticing Zhou Ze's gaze, the girl looked up, glanced at Zhou Ze again, then smiled.\n\n\"Are you the owner of this shop?\" the girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, picked up his water cup, and took a sip.\n\n*Composure, must maintain composure.*\n\n\"How's business at this bookstore?\" the girl asked again.\n\nZhou Ze frowned. He hated it when people asked that question, because those who asked it had usually already figured out that the bookstore's business with the living wasn't good.\n\nBut he couldn't explain to them that he did business with the dead, so he could only silently endure their gaze, as if he were an idiot with money to burn.\n\n\"It's alright.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think your shop is really nice. Coming here at night to read a book and have a drink, it has a great atmosphere,\" the girl said.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nHaving just taken in the little loli, Zhou Ze was in a decent mood and willing to chat with the customer, so he asked:\n\n\"Are you a radio host?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head.\n\n\"Then an audiobook narrator?\"\n\nThe girl smiled and nodded, \"Boss, you're very smart.\"\n\nIt wasn't about being smart; these days, there were only a few professions related to voice.\n\n\"What kind of narration?\"\n\n\"Novels.\" The girl took out her phone, and at the same time asked, \"Boss, do you usually listen to audiobooks?\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that there seemed to be many audio novels saved on Xu Le's computer, such as the audio version of \"The Story of Bai Jie\" series.\n\n\"Occasionally,\" Zhou Ze replied dismissively.\n\n\"This is my stage name, 'Hua Ye.' I'm a signed host for Lanren Tingshu. Boss, you can try listening to the books I've recorded,\" the girl introduced herself to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What kind of novels do you usually record?\"\n\n\"I like recording horror novels. In the audiobook market, horror, romance, and another major genre used to be quite popular.\"\n\n\"Another genre?\" Zhou Ze caught the key point.\n\n\"They don't allow recording them anymore. Those were slightly explicit novels. They used to be allowed, and quite a lot of people were willing to listen. But now, regulations are strict, and they're forbidden.\n\nIn fact, when we attended professional training classes, we specifically learned the techniques for recording books of that kind.\"\n\n\"There were even special classes for that?\"\n\n\"Yes, the teacher would hold classes, and a group of us signed hosts would attend together, dozens of men and women sitting together, following the teacher's rhythm and all 'ahhh-ing' with emotion and expressiveness.\n\nThen the teacher on the podium would constantly shout at us: 'Be more emotional, be more intense, be more relaxed!'\"\n\nZhou Ze's mouth slightly agape. This was truly eye-opening.\n\nImagine that atmosphere; it was truly somewhat captivating, a sophisticated version of a wine pond and meat forest¹.\n\nOf course, this was art. After all, such matters and anything related to them weren't truly that dirty, since no one was born from their mothers conceiving after bathing in sunlight².\n\n\"When we were in class, one of our female classmates was called out by the teacher for not being relaxed enough. She said indignantly, 'Teacher, I'm already loose, how much looser do you want me to get?'\"\n\nAfter saying this, the girl herself laughed. Clearly, she was someone who enjoyed chatting and talking, and of course, talking was also part of her profession.\n\n\"What brought you here?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nEspecially so late at night.\n\n\"A fan asked me to come,\" the girl replied. \"He's been following my work for a long time, ever since I was a newcomer six years ago when I first started. He commented and left messages for me every day, supporting and encouraging me for a long time. I never expected that he and I both lived in Tongcheng. But he said he's going back to his hometown, which is very far from Tongcheng.\n\nSo he wanted to meet me, and I agreed.\"\n\n\"He must have tipped you a lot, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"Not much, but the people who are willing to accompany you when you're completely unknown are the ones most worth cherishing and protecting.\"\n\n\"He asked you to come to this bookstore, and he also said he was going somewhere far away.\"\n\nA bold guess arose in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nTo the living, his bookstore was just a quiet shop, but to another kind of person, it held an unusual significance.\n\n\"You say, are all the people who listen to your books alive?\"\n\n\"Of course! I never inflate clicks or recommendation votes. All this popularity and data are real; there are no zombie fans or Taobao package operations, you know.\"\n\nClearly, the girl misunderstood Zhou Ze's meaning.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. *She's answering a different question.*\n\nThe girl, still thinking Zhou Ze didn't believe her, continued:\n\n\"Boss, the audiobook market isn't truly big, but China has over a billion people. Even if the proportion of people who enjoy listening to audiobooks is low, it's still an incredible number given such a large population base.\n\nYou see,\n\nvision can limit one's imagination,\n\nwhile hearing can infinitely inspire one's imagination.\"\n\n\"That's quite profound.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up. Bai Yingying had finished her bath, and he was also ready to take one.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw a man in a white shirt walk in through the bookstore's entrance. He glanced around, first spotting Zhou Ze and giving a shy, somewhat timid smile,\n\nthen he saw the girl next to Zhou Ze and walked directly towards her.\n\nThe girl, however, seemed not to see him, completely unaware of anyone approaching.\n\n\"I really love your work, and I really love your voice. I'm leaving now, going away, so please keep up the good work.\n\nYou're not the little rookie narrator you used to be anymore; your popularity is already very high. Even without my company and support in the future, you'll become more and more famous!\n\nKeep going!\"\n\nThe boy made an encouraging gesture to the girl,\n\nHowever,\n\nthe girl heard nothing.\n\nInstead, she checked the time and muttered that her enthusiastic fan who had set up the meeting seemed to have stood her up.\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to send the boy to hell. Instead, he lingered for a while, casually picking up a book from the shelf.\n\nIndeed, the advent of the internet was truly a magical platform.\n\nAcross the screen,\n\nyou not only couldn't tell whether the person flirting and acting cute with you was a man or a woman.\n\nIn forums, in posts, in book review sections,\n\nthose replying to comments,\n\nliking your content,\n\ncursing at you,\n\nencouraging and supporting you,\n\nmight not just be the living,\n\nbut also...\n___\n¹ **Wine pond and meat forest (酒池肉林):** An ancient Chinese idiom describing extreme luxury and debauchery.\n² **Born from mothers conceiving after bathing in sunlight:** A sarcastic way of saying everyone is born through sexual reproduction, implying sex and related topics are not inherently dirty.",

    "content": "Companionship is the longest confession, and this kind of companionship was one where they simply couldn't even meet. The female streamer eventually left; she hadn't waited for the person who had invited her here. She'd probably go back and reply to that account, asking why they stood her up.\n\nBut what she might not have known was that the person had already permanently departed from this mortal world.\n\nThe boy proactively asked Zhou Ze to send him off. Zhou Ze didn't ask what obsession kept him lingering in the mortal world, and he didn't answer either. This time, sending a departed soul to hell was very easy and simple.\n\nIt could even be described as \"peaceful.\"\n\nThere was no resistance, no struggle, no dissatisfaction—only a sense of composure.\n\nAfter finishing this \"business\"¹, Zhou Ze went to take a shower and rest upstairs. After relocating to the new store, \"business\" had actually improved a lot. Seeing the constantly piling hell banknotes² truly gave the \"ghost\" a great sense of satisfaction.\n\nWhen he woke up, it was already noon. Going downstairs, Zhou Ze saw the Old Daoist sitting behind the bar, playing with the little monkey.\n\n\"'Morning, Boss,' the Old Daoist greeted.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nHe sat down on the sofa by the window. Another lazy, sun-drenched day was about to begin. This kind of life truly was leisurely, especially watching the ceaseless flow of people outside South Street.\n\nAll the hustle and bustle under heaven is for gain³. Watching others busying themselves for livelihood and dreams, while he himself could 'steal half a day's leisure from a floating life'⁴. Comparison breeds superiority, and superiority leads to better enjoyment.\n\n\"'Boss, what would you like to drink?'\"\n\nBai Yingying could only wake up when Zhou Ze did; once she moved too far away, Zhou Ze's sleep would be interrupted.\n\n\"'Tea, then.'\"\n\nBai Yingying quickly brewed and brought over the tea. At the same time, she placed an ashtray in front of Zhou Ze, then lit his cigarette before leaving.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze himself felt a bit lost, wondering if Bai Yingying knew the instructions left by Madam Bai, which was why she was so meticulously attentive to him. But from the looks of it, she truly seemed to have a 'naïve and sweet'⁵ vibe, and she also held great reverence and admiration for her Madam Bai.\n\nSome questions aren't suitable for digging to the root; it would be pointless then. Zhou Ze was also willing to continue playing dumb.\n\nDrinking tea,\n\nsmoking a cigarette,\n\nAnyway, there weren't many ghosts during the day; he'd only truly get busy after nightfall.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze still preferred sitting in the bookstore, waiting for customers to come, just like Jiang Taigong fishing for those willing to bite⁶. It wasn't that this had a lot of 'swag'⁷, but because he felt it wasn't tiring this way.\n\nHe didn't like running around aimlessly; that was too much hassle.\n\nHe picked up today's newspaper and flipped through it. The 'life-gambling' case was already unfolding and under trial. The police acted very quickly; one by one, the behind-the-scenes investors and so on were controlled and arrested. What awaited them would be righteous judgment.\n\nJust then, the bookstore door behind Zhou Ze was pushed open. The person who walked in made the Old Daoist's eyes light up, and he immediately glowered!\n\nIt was no wonder the Old Daoist reacted that way, because the person who entered was a monk with ordination scars⁸ on his head. He seemed to have ringworm—a 'scabby-headed monk,' quite interesting.\n\nThe monk wasn't tall, only about 1.6 meters, and a bit plump. He didn't have the demeanor of an enlightened master; compared to the Old Daoist's immortal-like posture, he wasn't just a little bit worse.\n\nSince ancient times, Buddhism and Daoism have not seen eye to eye. During ancient dynasties, when Daoism flourished, they suppressed Buddhism; when Buddhism flourished, they suppressed Daoism. After all, they had to compete for followers and resources; if you had more, I naturally had less.\n\nFrom the Old Daoist's perspective, the bookstore was his territory, and this scabby-headed monk was like someone coming to challenge his establishment⁹.\n\nBut unexpectedly, the scabby-headed monk didn't even look at the Old Daoist. He merely smiled in response to the 'hostile implications' released by the Old Daoist, then walked directly to Zhou Ze and sat down opposite him.\n\n\"'A cup of tea.'\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk said.\n\nThe Old Daoist brought over a cup of tea with a dark expression. At the same time, he reminded him, \"The minimum consumption here is one hundred, and we don't do fortune-telling or feng shui.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk slightly raised his head, looked at the Old Daoist, and smiled faintly:\n\n\"'We are different.'\"\n\n\"We are different\"—\n\nA very profound statement. It both belittled the Old Daoist and elevated himself.\n\nMeaning, \"you're a mixed-up charlatan; I have genuine talent and learning, we are different.\"\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring, which happened to land right on the other's face.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze wanted to stick up for the Old Daoist—after all, a guest was a guest—but the moment the other entered the bookstore, Zhou Ze felt a faint sense of alarm.\n\nThe scabby-headed monk didn't get angry either. He simply put his palms together, uttering, \"Amitābha.\"\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze suddenly felt uncomfortable all over, as if countless ants were crawling haphazardly all over him.\n\nAt that moment, the fingers holding the cigarette began slowly growing black nails.\n\n\"'Patron, please calm your anger. This humble monk has come for tea and to read, with no ill intent.'\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk released his clasped hands, picked up the teacup, and took a sip of tea. Immediately, Zhou Ze's discomfort faded.\n\n\"'Go busy yourself,' Zhou Ze said to the Old Daoist.\n\nThe Old Daoist could only retreat.\n\n\"'Patron, this shop opened amidst a bustling market is indeed quite interesting. A quiet elegance found within a bustling city.'\"\n\nZhou Ze said nothing.\n\n\"'This humble monk is currently traveling in all directions. Today, by chance, I arrived in Tongcheng, but discovered that two old friends I knew were both gone, which truly piqued my curiosity. After some investigation, I learned that a figure like yourself, Patron, has appeared in Tongcheng.'\"\n\n\"'Who are those two friends of yours?'\"\n\n\"'One is a woman, in the prime of her youth. One is an old man, working at the Confucius Temple.'\"\n\nZhou Ze mused slightly to himself. The former should refer to the female ghost messenger who had an issue. The latter should be the dwarfish old man from the Confucius Temple.\n\n\"'Are you here to avenge them?'\"\n\n\"'Not so, not so. Causes arise and cease, all have their destiny. Joys and sorrows, partings and reunions, all depend on fate. Everything cannot be forced, nor should it be forced. This humble monk came today simply to see you, Patron, to sit and converse with you, and to forge a good karma.'\"\n\n\"'It seems those who form good karma with you don't end up well.'\"\n\nHearing this, the scabby-headed monk smiled speechlessly.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze said nothing, and the scabby-headed monk also said nothing. The atmosphere suddenly turned awkward.\n\nIt was probably when the tea had cooled that the scabby-headed monk finally spoke:\n\n\"'This humble monk has come to convey some thoughts and elaborate on some principles to the ghost messengers. Wherever this humble monk goes, I always seek out the local ghost messengers to speak my mind.'\"\n\n\"'You speak, I'll listen. After you're done, you still have to pay.'\"\n\n\"'Buddha said, all living beings are equal. The living beings here, in fact, include not only the living, but also the deceased. They were born here, grew up here, and are actually no different from the living.\n\nThose who seek good are the foundation of all beings, and should be cherished.\n\nThose who fall into evil are a scourge to all beings, and should be punished.\n\nFor malevolent ghosts harming people, there is naturally the wrathful aspect of a Vajra¹⁰, but for ordinary departed souls, who linger in the mortal world either due to obsession or various other reasons, this humble monk believes they have the right and the freedom to do so.\n\nHowever, regarding matters of the Underworld Bureau, ever since the demise of the Lord of Mount Tai, it has operated by a system of performance points and achievements. Any ghost lingering in the mortal world must be sent down to hell.\n\nThis humble monk has always disagreed with this practice.\n\nTherefore, I have come to persuade you, superior ghost messenger. Ghosts also have good and bad aspects, and there are pros and cons. One cannot apply a one-size-fits-all approach¹¹ to everything; otherwise, it's lazy governance, it's negligent governance.'\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit like laughing.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze's reaction, the scabby-headed monk sighed. A practitioner of the Way must row upstream, doing what is known to be impossible¹².\n\nHe picked up the newspaper in front of Zhou Ze and turned to the last page. On it was news from another province, reporting a murder case.\n\n\"'This humble monk has read this newspaper. When this incident occurred, this humble monk himself was not far from there.\n\nA man went missing; his relatives reported it to the police. The police suspected he might have been killed, but they couldn't find the body and were at a loss.\n\nAt this time, a woman from the same village told the police that her deceased old mother had appeared to her in a dream last night, informing her that someone was buried next to her house, occupying her territory.\n\nThe police initially dismissed it as a joke, but when they sent people to check by her old mother's grave, they found a newly disturbed patch of earth; after excavating, they discovered the missing man's corpse.\n\nLater, based on the evidence remaining on the corpse, the true culprit was found. It was none other than Li Mou from the same village.\n\nThe real murderer was caught, and the victim could rest in peace.\n\nIn this case, the soul of that woman's old mother did a good deed. Good and evil reside in the heart.\n\nAlthough she lingered in that area and never went to hell, she didn't harm anyone; in fact, she even helped someone. For a ghost like this, do you think the Underworld Bureau should take it to hell?\n\nShe might have just wanted to watch her children and grandchildren grow up and carry on the family line, that's all.'\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the cold tea, took a sip, and shook his head.\n\nClearly, Zhou Ze did not agree with this statement.\n\n\"'You still haven't managed to persuade me. I'm sorry, you've made a wasted trip. You can go to other cities and other territories, and talk about your ideals and principles with other ghost messengers. Maybe you'll find a kindred spirit, and then fight for ghost rights with them.'\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk smiled helplessly. Clearly, he had seen this kind of response many times. He then somewhat helplessly picked up the newspaper again, looked at the news, and sighed once more.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pressed the newspaper down.\n\nThe scabby-headed monk looked at Zhou Ze, a bit puzzled.\n\n\"'Monk, there's a saying: don't rush to run before you've learned to walk. You say you've been fighting for ghost rights, but if you can't even see people clearly, what right do you have to speak for ghosts?'\"\n\n\"'What do you mean?'\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and tapped the news article, shaking his head as he said:\n\n\"'You said you were in that area at the time. So, did you find that old mother's departed soul in that village?'\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk shook his head. \"'This humble monk was not fortunate enough to see her. If I had been fortunate enough, I would certainly have treated her with respect. Though the old woman's body perished, her good intentions remained.'\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"'I haven't been to that place, but I can bet you a drawer full of hell banknotes: there was no departed soul of this old mother at all. After she died, her soul had long gone to hell.'\"\n\n\"'How is that possible... You're a ghost messenger, do you not believe there are ghosts in this world?'\"\n\n\"'The missing victim was from the same village.\n\nThe murderer who hid the body was also from the same village.\n\nAnd then a woman who supposedly relayed clues to the police through a dream was also from the same village—isn't that obvious enough?'\"\n\nZhou Ze lit another cigarette and said, \"The newspaper says the police initially didn't believe it, and later, after excavating the grave and finding the body, they also found it very strange. This is just a journalist's style, to make the news interesting and attract attention.\n\nBut in reality, I believe the local police were well aware.\n\nThe woman came to report it. There's a high probability she passed by and saw the murderer burying the body.'\"\n\n\"'Then why didn't she tell the police directly?' the scabby-headed monk asked.\n\n\"'Because the murderer was also from the same village. The murderer might have parents, children, siblings. If she reported them directly, wouldn't she be hated by their family?\n\nSo, she used the pretext of ghosts and gods, like the old mother appearing in a dream, and vaguely, 'in the clouds and mist,' revealed the clue in this manner, just so she wouldn't incur hatred.\n\nIt's like some human trafficking cases in remote areas. Do you think the neighbors don't know that this family bought someone back?\n\nOr, do you think everyone in the entire village is bad, that no one has a conscience, that not a single person has good intentions in their heart?\n\nIt's just because everyone felt that reporting it would offend their neighbors, whom they see every day¹³, and even if they sympathized with the poor woman who was trafficked, they could only pretend not to see.'\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk was slightly stunned, and asked in confusion, \"'What is this?'\"\n\n\"'Human nature.'\"\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"Business\": Refers to Zhou Ze's unusual work of dealing with the dead and the underworld.\n² \"Hell banknotes\" (冥鈔): Also known as joss paper or ghost money, burnt as offerings to the deceased in Chinese traditional religion to provide them with wealth in the afterlife.\n³ \"All the hustle and bustle under heaven is for gain\" (天下攘攘皆為利往): A classical Chinese idiom from the *Records of the Grand Historian* (Shiji), implying that all human activity and societal movement are driven by self-interest and the pursuit of profit.\n⁴ \"Steal half a day's leisure from a floating life\" (偷得浮生半日閒): An idiom meaning to snatch a moment of peace or leisure from a busy, unsettled, or transient existence.\n⁵ \"Naïve and sweet\" (傻白甜): An internet slang term often used to describe a character (usually female) who is innocent, somewhat naive, kind-hearted, and often a little clumsy or easily fooled, but ultimately endearing.\n⁶ \"Jiang Taigong fishing for those willing to bite\" (姜太公釣魚願者上鉤): An idiom referring to a strategy where one sets up a situation and waits patiently for suitable candidates or opportunities to present themselves, without actively pursuing them.

    "content": "The Beggar Monk arrived suddenly and left just as suddenly. Of course, under the Layman Daoist's fierce gaze, he paid his bill.\n\n\"Is this guy sick, boss?\" the Layman Daoist asked grumpily. \"This humble Daoist just stood by and listened a bit; he actually advised you, boss, not to catch ghosts. If you don't catch ghosts, boss, where will your performance and underworld currency come from?\"\n\nAfter speaking, the Layman Daoist waved his hand and turned off the lights in the shop. Even though it was daytime, the brightness in the shop immediately dropped significantly after the lights were off. Immediately after, he shouted as if presenting a treasure:\n\n\"Monkey!\"\n\nThe little monkey immediately jumped over, holding two plastic fans in its hands. The fans were also stained with silver glitter, and when waved, they indeed created a brilliant effect.\n\nThe Layman Daoist and the monkey stood in a row. The monkey and the Layman Daoist stomped their feet downwards in unison, simultaneously shouting:\n\n\"Our slogan is!\"\n\n\"Effort! Effort! Effort!\" (Squeaking)\n\n\"Our spirit is!\"\n\n\"Struggle! Struggle! Struggle!\" (Squeaking)\n\n\"Our goal is!\"\n\n\"Underworld currency! Underworld currency! Underworld currency!\" (Squeaking)\n\n\"Alright, fall out!\"\n\nThe monkey immediately backed away and jumped back to the counter.\n\nZhou Ze, standing by, didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\n\"Underworld currency is justice, underworld currency is everything. Boss, you absolutely must not be fooled by him, ah.\"\n\nThe Layman Daoist had a scar on his chest. It was said that he had once avoided a knife stab to his heart thanks to underworld currency, which is why he had a deep obsession with it.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, indicating that he understood.\n\n\"Huh, it's you?\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and a young man walked in.\n\nZhou Ze knew this young man. He was an intern doctor from People's Hospital. Back when Zhou Ze pretended to be a doctor to treat patients at the hospital, he had been there several times, and Zhou Ze had also helped him out of tricky situations a few times.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\nThe young intern doctor was very curious about Zhou Ze. Naturally naive, he hadn't yet inquired about the relationship between Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin and still thought Zhou Ze was really a doctor.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze's medical methods were indeed superb, which truly made it impossible for the young intern doctor to tell the difference.\n\n\"Being a doctor has no future, so I started a business.\" Zhou Ze casually brushed him off.\n\n\"Is this the bookstore you opened?\"\n\n\"Sort of.\"\n\nJust then, Tang Shi appeared at the staircase entrance, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You sit down first, I'll be right back.\"\n\nThe young doctor sat down nearby. The Layman Daoist eagerly served tea; as long as you accepted the tea, it was a minimum charge of one hundred.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Tang Shi. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Are you free tomorrow?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what were you planning to do tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Haven't decided yet.\"\n\nTang Shi nodded, indicating she understood. \"Then let's have dinner together tomorrow night.\"\n\nThe words had barely fallen when Tang Shi and Zhou Ze both frowned.\n\nHaving dinner together tomorrow, for ordinary people, was a normal social phrase. But for these two, it was no less than torture.\n\nHaving dinner together tomorrow night, in their ears, could be translated as \"electric shock together tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"Let's have tea then,\" Tang Shi corrected herself.\n\n\"Are guests coming?\"\n\n\"Sort of.\" Tang Shi looked around and said, \"You can relax, I won't be fighting you for female servants anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\nAfter finishing his conversation with Tang Shi, Zhou Ze turned around and walked back to his original spot. The Layman Daoist and the young intern doctor were chatting excitedly. The two of them seemed poised to become friends despite their age difference.\n\nOf course, with the Layman Daoist's experience, he could chat with anyone from all walks of life and become bosom buddies.\n\n\"What's up?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, he says the bodies in their hospital morgue are always getting damaged or going missing, but they can't find out who's doing it. I just gave him a tip.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the Layman Daoist took a plastic bottle out of his pocket. It was fluorescent powder.\n\n\"I'm telling you, it's definitely someone inside your hospital doing it. You secretly sprinkle this on the bodies. If you catch the thief, then you, an intern doctor, can also become a regular employee.\"\n\n\"Become a regular employee at the Public Security Bureau?\" Zhou Ze looked at the Layman Daoist. \"What kind of bad advice are you giving people?\"\n\nAt this moment, the young intern doctor answered a phone call. It was probably urging him to return to the hospital. After hanging up the phone, he smiled at the Layman Daoist and shook his hand, then turned and left the bookstore.\n\n\"Boss, do people really steal bodies?\" the Layman Daoist asked somewhat curiously. He knew Zhou Ze was a doctor in his previous life and must know some inside information.\n\n\"Yes, there are,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What for then, to steal bodies for organ transplants?\" the Layman Daoist immediately asked.\n\n\"Do you think organ transplants are that simple? The conditions for organ transplants are very strict. Stealing bodies from the morgue for organ transplants is basically impossible.\n\nGenerally speaking, in the past, they could be sent to some medical schools or research institutes for dissection experiments. After all, human bodies are not white mice, and experimental specimens are very scarce.\n\nOthers are quite superstitious; they steal bodies for ghost marriages. Additionally, some people believe that drinking powder made from ground human skulls can cure diseases. In short, there are all sorts of theories, so body snatching is actually quite serious. However, it has gotten much better since cremation was promoted domestically.\"\n\n\"Grind a skull into powder and drink it? Like pearl powder?\" The Layman Daoist made a motion as if he wanted to vomit.\n\nZhou Ze sat back down in his window-side seat. A Nissan stopped in front of the bookstore. A person got out of the car—someone who had previously gone back to his hometown.\n\n\"You're back!\"\n\nThe Layman Daoist was very excited seeing Xu Qinglang's figure. He was tired of takeout, so he especially missed the days when Xu Qinglang was at the shop.\n\nZhou Ze was quite calm, but also let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. His sour plum juice was almost finished.\n\nXu Qinglang didn't come in; instead, he waved at Zhou Ze, and then squatted down at the shop entrance.\n\nHe looked troubled.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the shop door, stood beside him, thought for a moment, and also squatted down.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang didn't rush to answer; instead, he handed Zhou Ze a cigarette, then sighed and said:\n\n\"Went home for a blind date.\"\n\n\"That's good news,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Sigh.\"\n\n\"Didn't hit it off?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"Hit it off too quickly.\"\n\n\"How fast? Went to bed?\"\n\nXu Qinglang glanced at Zhou Ze, but didn't deny it.\n\n\"That's really fast,\" Zhou Ze exclaimed.\n\n\"I'm not like you, I'm still normal,\" Xu Qinglang reminded him.\n\n\"Then why the long face?\"\n\n\"The problem is, afterwards, she left a sum of money on my bedside table, and then left.\"\n\n\"You were paid for sex?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\nXu Qinglang was a bit depressed and said:\n\n\"We were originally supposed to meet for a blind date at a cafe, but my blind date had a sudden engagement and didn't come. I didn't get the notice and mistook someone else for my blind date. Then I sat in front of her and chatted. Then I invited her to watch a movie. Then accompanied her shopping. Then, in the evening, she invited me to get a hotel room to show me a script she had just finished writing. She's a scriptwriter.\"\n\n\"I bet it was a fluorescent script, the kind you have to turn off the lights to read.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was a bit helpless, and reached out and scratched his hair.\n\n\"After she left, she put three thousand yuan on my bedside table. I had thought she was my blind date, and was a bit surprised if she was too open and avant-garde, or if it was just love at first sight that she couldn't control?\"\n\n\"Most love at first sight is actually lust at first sight.\"\n\n\"But it turns out that wasn't the case.\" Xu Qinglang was very conflicted.\n\n\"She treated you like a male escort?\"\n\n\"Can you shut up?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze with a resentful expression.\n\n\"You took the money, and you slept with the person, you didn't lose anything.\"\n\n\"That's easy for you to say, but I feel my self-esteem has been hit. I'm a man with over twenty apartments, and I actually got paid for sex by a woman, like a male escort!\"\n\n\"Actually, if you think about some things from a different perspective, you might feel a bit better mentally.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"For example, among male escorts, you have the most houses.\"\n\n\"............\"\n\n\"Or, among people with many houses, you're the most like a male escort.\"\n\n\"............\"\n\n\"Sorry, I'm not very good at comforting people.\" Zhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder and continued:\n\n\"Cheer up a bit.\n\nThe bed is inherently the most decadent place in the world. Why take seriously a relationship that began in bed?\n\nBy the way, did you go back to your hometown specifically for a blind date?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. The ancestral graves at home are going to be relocated due to demolition, so I went back to move them. Oh, and something strange happened, I'll tell you in a few days. Now I want to go up and rest first.\"\n\nXu Qinglang stood up, pushed open the bookstore door, took a bottle of red wine from the counter, and went upstairs to his room.\n\nThe entire afternoon passed quite leisurely and relaxed. When it was eight o'clock in the evening, Zhou Ze finally perked up. Usually, by this time, the real customers should be arriving.\n\nXu Qinglang probably went to drown his sorrows in alcohol and didn't come downstairs. Therefore, dinner was still takeout.\n\nThe Layman Daoist and the little monkey sat on a stool. The two of them had a peanut with a sip of liquor. The little monkey's alcohol tolerance had also been developed by the Layman Daoist.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and a crisp sound came from the door curtain.\n\nThe one who pushed open the door and entered was that intern doctor.\n\nThe Layman Daoist was a bit drunk, and reached out to invite the intern doctor to have a drink together.\n\nThere was nothing he could do; in the entire bookstore, he couldn't find anyone else to drink with him. He could only drink with the monkey. Now that a living person had arrived, he was naturally happy.\n\n\"I just got off work, I completely forgot I didn't pay for my visit here today. Oh, and I still owe you for the fluorescent powder.\" The intern doctor was still as dull and honest as ever.\n\n\"Oh, come on, it was just a hundred yuan for tea. And with the fluorescent powder, it's only one hundred and fifty, isn't it?\"\n\nThe Layman Daoist said, pretending to be generous.\n\nThe other party handed over the money. The Layman Daoist took it angrily, then patted the intern doctor's shoulder and said:\n\n\"If you really want to thank me, invite me out to a restaurant. Let us two brothers have a good drink and chat.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the Layman Daoist glanced at Zhou Ze somewhat guiltily.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, granting permission.\n\nThe intern doctor didn't refuse either. He wasn't a local, and due to his personality, he didn't have many good friends here. So, he and the Layman Daoist hooked arms and left the bookstore to find a bar.\n\nIt was already dark, and the streetlights were quite bright.\n\nThe Layman Daoist and the intern doctor walked for a while. When they were almost at the bar ahead, the Layman Daoist turned into a dark alley nearby, unbuckled his pants, and said:\n\n\"Excuse me, I need to take a leak first.\"\n\nThe intern doctor didn't act like a stranger either; he stood side by side with the Layman Daoist and also unbuckled his belt.\n\n\"Hey, you kid, so down-to-earth, I like it!\"\n\n\"Haha, it's quite exciting, urinating in public.\" The intern doctor was clearly led astray by the Layman Daoist.\n\n\"What's this? Just human nature, isn't it? By the way, did you wipe the fluorescent powder I gave you earlier on the bodies?\" the Layman Daoist asked.\n\n\"I did, but a body went missing again today. The hospital already called the police, but the police still couldn't find any clues.\"\n\n\"It didn't work?\" the Layman Daoist said somewhat apologetically.\n\n\"No, it didn't work.\" The intern doctor nodded.\n\n\"Alright, then let's split the bill for tonight's drinks.\"\n\n\"No worries, it's my treat,\" the intern doctor said.\n\n\"Alright, you're a respectable kid, I like your style!\"\n\nAs he spoke, the Layman Daoist didn't wash his hands either; he directly patted the other party's shoulder as encouragement!\n\n\"You're older, you deserve it.\"\n\nThe intern doctor smiled slightly.\n\nThe Layman Daoist suddenly froze.\n\nHe hadn't noticed before, because there were lights in the bookstore and streetlights on the road.\n\nBut in this dark alley,\n\nThe Layman Daoist suddenly saw that when the intern doctor smiled,\n\non the teeth in his mouth,\n\nthere was a faint,\n\nfluorescent glow.",

    "content": "The hand that had just relieved itself,\ntrembled slightly.\n\nThe Old Taoist now deeply regretted why he had skipped work to come out drinking. Wasn't staying diligently in the bookstore, wholeheartedly serving ghosts, a very good and noble profession?!\nDrink what wine!\n\nThe Old Taoist was no ordinary person. Although he couldn't compare to Xu Qinglang, having no Taoist magic himself and just being a charlatan who lived by his wits, he had, at least, served two generations of \"ghosts.\" He still had a keen eye and had witnessed many bizarre and fantastical events.\n\nThe faint layer of fluorescent light on the intern doctor's teeth was like the smile of a demon in the dark, making one feel truly uneasy. The faucet that had just been turned off seemed to have been turned on again; if he wasn't careful, it might start dripping.^[1]^\n\nThe Old Taoist had previously instructed him to sprinkle the fluorescent powder on the corpse, and the intern doctor had replied that he had done so.\nThen, the fluorescent powder appeared on his teeth. This association instantly sent shivers down his spine.\n\nThe Old Taoist didn't foolishly ask, \"Oh, you're quite romantic, brushing your teeth with fluorescent toothpaste, huh?\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\nThe intern doctor asked, perplexed, as he watched the Old Taoist staring at him.\n\nThe Old Taoist suddenly clutched his stomach and said apologetically, \"Excuse me, my stomach suddenly hurts so much. I probably ate something bad recently.\"\n\"Let me take you to the hospital. Anyway, the hospital isn't far from here,\" the intern doctor said, helping the Old Taoist up. \"Why are you shaking?\"\n\n\"Damn it, my liver hurts. It's cirrhosed, cirrhosed! I need to go back and take my medicine, or I'll have a cerebral hemorrhage and a stroke, and my heart disease will flare up too.\"\nThe Old Taoist babbled incoherently. In short, it was one sentence: I'm outta here!\nEven if he had to claim other terminal illnesses, he had to leave. This world was too dangerous; the bookstore was still safe. Now, the Old Taoist suddenly felt how reassuring Zhou Ze looked while lazily sunbathing, and what great comfort Miss Tang's every cold remark brought him!\n\n\"Let me take you back,\" the intern doctor said.\n\"No, no, you're tired too. You should rest. Go back and rest. You have work tomorrow, don't you? You can't be careless with that; you need to heal the sick and save lives.\"\n\nWithout waiting for the intern doctor's reply, the Old Taoist finished speaking, directly broke free from his support, and ran towards the bookstore.\nUnder the streetlights, the Old Taoist ran while looking back, terrified that the intern doctor would suddenly give chase. But the other party remained motionless, standing in the dark alley where the two had just relieved themselves.\nAnd that faint glow of fluorescence kept flickering there, as if the other party was standing there, smiling as he watched him run.\n\nHe ran all the way to the bookstore in one breath. The Old Taoist pushed open the door and immediately prostrated himself on the ground, gasping for air. He had used every ounce of his strength to run back, his body already soaked in sweat—half from the heat, half from fright.\n\nZhou Ze was sitting behind the counter, tidying up shelves. Seeing the Old Taoist return in such a state, he smiled and said:\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Boss, do you know what I just saw? That guy, that guy's teeth were glowing!\"\nThe Old Taoist recounted the events, gesticulating wildly, speaking as if he had barely escaped from the devil's grasp after a fierce magical duel that caused mountains to crumble, earth to crack, water to flow backward, and the sun and moon to change color!\nTruly, terrifying to this extent!\n\nBut Zhou Ze remained calm, continuing with his task as if nothing had happened.\nAfter finishing his story, the Old Taoist picked up the water on the table and gulped it down, calming his inner turmoil. He asked, \"Boss, why don't you feel anything at all?\"\n\n\"Maybe he was just playing a trick on you.\"\n\"A trick?\" The Old Taoist asked with a long, mournful face. \"What if he wasn't?\"\n\n\"Then he might have a bit of necrophagy. It's no big deal. You can go to the police. I think there's a crime called desecration of a corpse; you can press charges.\"\n\"And then?\" The Old Taoist continued to ask.\n\"Then what?\"\n\"Boss, aren't you going to do something?\" The Old Taoist asked, surprised.\n\"Do you need me to do something?\" Zhou Ze countered.\n\n\"............\" The Old Taoist.\n\"Didn't you come back safely? Nothing happened, did it? Besides, if he really was eating corpses, would he deliberately sprinkle fluorescent powder on them first and then eat them?\nIs he stupid?\"\n\n\"Boss, whether you believe it or not, I don't think that was a joke.\" The Old Taoist said very seriously, \"I think for the peace and security of society, we shouldn't just stand by. If he truly is a necrophiliac, it's one thing if he's secretly eating corpses in the hospital right now, but what if he can't steal corpses later and still wants to eat? Who can guarantee he won't do something even more extreme in the future?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded upon hearing this, seeming to find the Old Taoist's words very reasonable. Then, he reached out and patted the head of the little monkey beside him, saying:\n\"Then you take Monkey Bro to subdue demons and eliminate evil, and restore a clear and peaceful world to humanity.\"\nThe little monkey didn't understand but felt greatly invigorated, vigorously swinging the plastic toy hammer in its hand.\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist's old face immediately fell. He sat down on a nearby chair, clearly still somewhat shaken.\n\nAfter a while, the Old Taoist looked up at Zhou Ze and saw him preparing some snacks and a little wine. He asked curiously, \"Boss, are you preparing a late-night snack?\"\n\"Offerings.\"\n\"Offerings? Qingming Festival is already over. Going to a grave?\"\n\"Mm.\"\n\"For whom?\"\n\"For me.\"\n\"This...\"\n\"Today is my birthday,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nThe Old Taoist was slightly stunned. He felt a deep sense of incongruity when a \"living person\" told him he was going to make offerings to himself, especially celebrating his own posthumous birthday.^[2]^\n\nZhou Ze packed his things, slung a shoulder bag over his shoulder, and walked out from behind the counter.\n\"Boss, why don't I go with you?\" The Old Taoist offered eagerly. \"You don't have a driver's license.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded.\nIf he drove himself and encountered a traffic police stop, not having a license would indeed be troublesome.\n\nThe Old Taoist drove Xu Qinglang's Nissan, taking Zhou Ze to the cemetery grounds.\nThe cemetery grounds were already closed, but the fence wasn't very high; a slight climb was all it took to get in.\nThe Old Taoist understood why Zhou Ze wanted to come at night; only at night, when everything was quiet and deserted, could one truly experience that feeling.\n\nIn the cemetery, gravestones were neatly arranged, marking the final resting place for many people's lives.\nLate at night, faint whispers surprisingly drifted through the cemetery, as if someone was speaking there.\nAt first, the Old Taoist thought he was hallucinating, but after listening carefully for a while, he realized there really was sound. He immediately reached down and touched his crotch.\n\n\"Boss, there's a demonic aura!\"\nZhou Ze ignored him, simply pointing to a small stand ahead. On it was a box with a speaker inside, its surface covered by a solar panel.\nThe sound was emanating from within it.\nThe Old Taoist was a bit dumbfounded. He curiously leaned in to look, finding an instruction manual that detailed what programs played at what times each day: morning news, emotional programs, international news, local news, and so on.\n\"Damn, it's this humanized now?\"\nThe Old Taoist had only heard of people leaving QR codes on their gravestones before, which he already found quite avant-garde. He never expected someone would actually place something like this next to their tombstone for entertainment.\n\nZhou Ze found his own gravestone. It bore his photograph and a brief summary of his life.\nQingming Festival had just passed, and in front of the gravestone were still wreaths, small toys, and letters—some from his colleagues, others from the children at the orphanage.\nZhou Ze sat down in front of his gravestone and opened the letters one by one. They were all messages from the children to him, expressing their longing.\nThey all began with \"Brother Zhou\" or \"Dear Brother Zhou.\" Some children's letters used a lot of Pinyin because they hadn't fully learned the characters.\nZhou Ze leaned against his gravestone, quietly reading. He didn't cry, nor did his eyes well up.\n\nAfter a while, Zhou Ze laid out the liquor and food he had brought, then reached out to slowly eat and drink them himself.\nHe usually found eating quite painful, and this time was no exception. But eating while reading the children's letters seemed to have the effect of sour plum juice.\nAlthough it was still difficult to swallow and still nauseating, this time he actually managed to endure it without throwing up.\n\nThe Old Taoist squatted nearby, watching his boss eat the offerings. He didn't say anything; he understood.\nHe was dead, yet he was still alive.\nThe offerings were originally for himself, for his own enjoyment.\n\nThe night wind was cool, blowing all around.\nAt this moment, it truly seemed like a quiet and peaceful time.\n\nAfter finishing the letters, Zhou Ze stretched and looked at his gravestone.\nHe still remembered that day when he was pushed into the crematorium, and the great fire consumed him.\nErasing,\nthe traces of his previous life.\nBeneath the gravestone, his ashes were placed.\n\n\"Boss, why don't I secretly dig it out for you and take it back as a memento?\" The Old Taoist suggested from beside him.\nZhou Ze shook his head. Let the past be the past. He no longer held such deep obsession; perhaps he once did, but now he had slowly come to terms with it.\nHowever, inadvertently, Zhou Ze noticed a very subtle mark on the masonry of the gravestone. He immediately shone his phone's flashlight downwards.\n\nSeeing this, the Old Taoist also crouched down to look, then said, \"This gravestone has been opened recently!\"\nInstinctively, Zhou Ze had a bad feeling. He hadn't intended to take his ashes, but that didn't mean he was willing to see anything happen to them.\nUltimately, this was his own possession.\n\nHis fingernails instantly grew long. Zhou Ze directly inserted his fingernails into the crack and pried it open, saving himself the trouble of finding a shovel.\nSoon, the masonry below was dug open, revealing a black urn inside.\nHe took out the urn. The box had weight, meaning there was something inside.\nZhou Ze used his fingernail to pry open the lock, then opened the urn.\nInside the box,\nthere was something,\nbut not ashes,\nbut rather small, crystal-clear particles.\n\"Damn it, Boss, you cremated sarira!\"^[3]^\n\nZhou Ze reached out, grabbed one of the small particles, and squeezed it gently. It crumbled. At the same time, suppressing a terrifying rage, he said in a deep, furious voice:\n\"Have you ever seen sarira made of plastic?\"\n\n***\n### Footnotes\n1.

    "content": "Angry?\n\nMust be angry!\n\n\"Boss, we... let's call the police.\"\n\nOld Daoist suggested from the side.\n\nThen, he found Zhou Ze looking at him with a gaze like one caring for a mentally disabled child.\n\nUh...\n\nDid I say something wrong?\n\nBut weren't you always saying to call the police for things, to be a good, law-abiding citizen? I've just been implementing your words and spirit.\n\n\"Old Daoist,\" Zhou Ze slowly said.\n\n\"Huh.\"\n\n\"Your money was stolen, are you angry?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm angry.\"\n\n\"Then your ashes were stolen, are you angry?\"\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nWho the hell, like a pervert like you, can still discuss whether to be angry when their original body has turned into ashes?\n\n\"I'm going to find that guy.\"\n\nBlack light began to flow in Zhou Ze's eyes, and his ten fingernails emitted an eerie glow.\n\n\"Then, I'll tear him to pieces!\"\n\nStealing anything but my ashes, then I'll make you buried with my ashes.\n\n\"The cemetery office is over there. Go retrieve the surveillance video.\"\n\nZhou Ze directed Old Daoist, who quickly nodded, \"Alright, you're the boss. Whatever you want to do, I'll do it. I won't blindly guess your intentions anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze directly broke off the cemetery gate's lock, and the two walked in. Old Daoist sat down in front of the computer in the surveillance room and began to retrieve old footage, simultaneously locking onto the camera that could observe Zhou Ze's tombstone.\n\n\"Night, during Qingming Festival.\"\n\nZhou Ze gave the specific time.\n\nBecause the trace of the tombstone being moved hadn't completely vanished, it must have happened just a few days ago. Otherwise, if another ten days or half a month had passed, Zhou Ze wouldn't have been able to discover this clue.\n\nHe might not even know that when he came to pay respects to himself every year, what he was paying respects to wasn't his own ashes, nor his past, but a box of plastic pellets.\n\nThen he would come over during holidays and festivals to mourn with a box of plastic pellets.\n\n\"Boss, if you ask me, since the other party stole something, they should have deleted the surveillance video as well. That's how it's always portrayed on TV.\n\nFor us to still come and check this surveillance video now, it's just the 'filler plot' that this humble Daoist dislikes the most when watching TV dramas.\n\nPurely useless, just for dragging out the show.\"\n\nZhou Ze placed his hand on Old Daoist's shoulder, his fingernails lightly swaying. That cold chill seemed to pierce directly into Old Daoist's body.\n\nOld Daoist's body stiffened in surprise. He immediately sat up straight, not daring to blabber anymore, and seriously began to play back the surveillance video.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nZhou Ze yelled.\n\nOld Daoist immediately pressed pause.\n\n\"Rewind a little more.\"\n\nOld Daoist began to rewind, and sure enough, a figure in red clothing appeared in the frame. The surveillance quality wasn't very good, and it was night, so the person's figure in the frame was very blurry; only the general color of their clothing could be discerned.\n\nHe actually found it?\n\nOld Daoist was a little surprised in his heart.\n\nThe footage played slowly,\n\nThe person in red clothing in the footage bent down, holding two scalpel-like objects, and pried open the tombstone. The movements were swift and clean, no slower than when Zhou Ze had used his fingernails earlier.\n\nThen the person took out the urn, removed a glass container, and poured the ashes into it. Afterwards, it looked like they scattered something else into the urn; if all went as expected, it should be that string of plastic pellets.\n\nThe man put the glass bottle into his embrace, then turned his head to look at the camera's position.\n\nFrom the perspective of the surveillance video, it was as if the person had aimed the camera at themselves, making eye contact with the viewer.\n\nThe person deliberately brought their face close to the camera,\n\nThis face,\n\nZhou Ze inexplicably felt was very familiar. It was an East Asian face, with very fair skin.\n\nHe began to search his jumbled memories for information about this person. Unfortunately, during his last confrontation with Qingyi Niangniang on the rooftop, he had entered a certain state, leading to severe memory loss from that time, so he couldn't recall who the person was for a while.\n\n\"Amen!\"\n\nAfter speaking these words, the person directly turned and left, leaving behind a meaningful smile.\n\nIt wasn't until the person's final \"Amen\" was spoken that Zhou Ze's pupils suddenly constricted,\n\nMemory images began to rewind incessantly, finally appearing in the villa surrounded by rapeseed flowers, next to that dining table, the priest who had been quietly standing there all along.\n\nIt was him!\n\nHe stole his own ashes!\n\n\"Boss, you know this person?\" Old Daoist asked, finding Zhou Ze's reaction strange.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nWhen the two walked out of the cemetery, it was already past one in the morning. Zhou Ze took out his phone and first called Xu Qinglang, but Xu Qinglang was probably drunk and didn't pick up.\n\nZhou Ze could only call Tang Shi.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Help me wake Xu Qinglang, no matter what method you use.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nAbout half a minute later, a scream came from the other end of the line.\n\nSubsequently, Xu Qinglang answered the phone with some resentment, directly cursing:\n\n\"Are you sick?! You made her wake me up!\"\n\n\"Give me the phone number of the lady who rented our shop.\"\n\n\"Tsk, I'll find it.\"\n\nXu Qinglang heard the suppressed anger in Zhou Ze's voice, and no longer complained to Zhou Ze. He immediately began to look for the phone and then recited the number.\n\nZhou Ze called, but a prompt tone came from the other end: \"The number you dialed is powered off. Please try again later.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Although Tongcheng was just a small city with a population of only a few million, finding someone there without any network of connections was very difficult.\n\nAnd now, Zhou Ze's anger urgently needed an outlet, but he had no way to find the priest's specific information.\n\nWhen he returned to the bookstore that night, Tang Shi was sitting inside reading a magazine, while Xu Qinglang was at the bar counter, with some bruises on his face.\n\n\"Did you make contact?\" Xu Qinglang asked while applying an egg to his face.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nXu Qinglang felt the pain on his face worsen. So, he got beaten for nothing?\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Tang Shi and asked, \"Is there any way to quickly find someone in this area?\"\n\nTang Shi put down the magazine in her hand and retorted, \"Why don't you scratch the ground with your fingernails and see if you can summon a local Earth God?\"\n\n\"I'm serious.\"\n\n\"I can't help either. Did you lose something?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Losing his own ashes wasn't something glorious to admit, even saying it out loud was comparable to having his underwear stolen.\n\nIt seemed there was no other way. That lady's phone couldn't be reached, and Zhou Ze believed that even if it could, finding the priest's address and information through her was very slim.\n\nIt seemed the other party had specifically investigated him. He could allow the video surveillance to remain untouched, likely because he was very confident in his hiding place, believing that Zhou Ze wouldn't be able to find him even if he discovered what happened.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze thought of something. He took out his phone and dialed a number that wasn't saved with a name:\n\n\"Hello, who are you?\"\n\nA cute loli voice came from the other end of the phone.\n\n\"Tell your sister to come out and talk,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who are you? I don't have a sis—... Inspector, I was just sleeping.\"\n\nThe loli voice suddenly changed into a mature, confident tone.\n\n\"Help me find someone, a priest from Japan who has been active in Tongcheng recently.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThen, only a 'biu' sound was heard from the other end of the line, and the call was disconnected.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit unreal,\n\nHe hadn't expected his newly acquired junior brother—oh no, junior sister—to be so efficient. After he instructed her to do something, she just said 'Oh' and went to handle it.\n\n\"Hey, let me ask you a question,\" Tang Shi suddenly said.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Tang Shi.\n\n\"Does your conscience still hurt recently?\" Tang Shi pointed to her heart.\n\nZhou Ze didn't quite understand what she meant, then shook his head.\n\n\"Heh...\" Tang Shi let out a laugh. \"It seems you're slowly getting used to it.\"\n\n\"Used to what?\"\n\n\"Used to living without a conscience, I guess.\"\n\nTang Shi stood up, seemingly preparing to go upstairs, and also reminded him: \"Tomorrow evening, let's have tea together. Don't forget.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the mood.\"\n\nTang Shi neither confirmed nor denied, and continued upstairs.\n\n…………\n\nInside the one-bedroom rental apartment, a priest sat on the sofa. On the coffee table in front of him were some pictures and documents. He was sitting there, deep in thought, and muttering to himself.\n\nJust then, the door opened.\n\nThe intern doctor walked in. When he saw the priest sitting on his own sofa, he was startled and shouted:\n\n\"Who are you, and why are you in my house!\"\n\nAt the same time, the intern doctor reached for his phone, preparing to call the police; he thought his house had been broken into.\n\nThe priest, however, appeared before him in the blink of an eye, one hand grabbing his wrist, the other clasping his neck.\n\nHis phone dropped to the floor,\n\nAnd his neck was lifted by the priest.\n\nThe intern doctor felt an intense sense of suffocation.\n\nThe priest remained motionless, maintaining this posture until the intern doctor's eyes slowly began to lose focus, and a hint of sinister cruelty appeared on his face.\n\n\"I clearly fed you something extracted from his ashes, so why could you only turn into this ghoul-like thing? What use is this kind of thing to me?\"\n\nThe priest kicked the intern doctor in the backside. The intern doctor tumbled to the ground, then immediately scrambled up, drool dripping from the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"Chomp.\"\n\nA raw pig's trotters was thrown onto the ground by the priest. The intern doctor immediately rushed over, held the trotters in his hands, and began gnawing on it. Bloodstains from the pig's trotters still remained on the corner of his mouth, but a look of dissatisfaction flashed in his eyes. Clearly, pig's trotters and pork couldn't satisfy him.\n\nThe priest shook his head and, with some helplessness, sat back down on the sofa.\n\n\"It seems that his ability to become a zombie isn't due to his body; it must be his soul at work. Because that body hosted his soul, it underwent some changes, which, when consumed by ordinary people, led to minor mutations. But these mutations are negligible.\n\nForget about zombies, they can't even become ghouls. All they gain is a 'lovely' hobby—eating corpses.\"\n\nThe priest rubbed his hands together,\n\n\"So, if it's not the body's reason, then is it the soul itself? His body in his previous life, wasn't it original either?\n\nHis 'borrowing a corpse to revive the soul' seemed on the surface to be arranged by the female ghost messenger, but in reality, is there something deeper hidden?\"\n\nThe priest picked up his coffee and took a sip,\n\nOn the coffee table in front of him were photos of Zhou Ze's previous life, photos of Xu Le, photos of his sister-in-law, and even a photo of the elder who had stabbed Zhou Ze with his fingernails that day he was sent to the hospital.\n\nThe priest pulled out a scalpel and directly shredded the photos of the elder and his sister-in-law, then let out a long breath,\n\n\"Time to investigate again.\"",

    "content": "No matter your mood, good or bad, there is one thing that does not shift or change according to human will, and that is time.\n\nA day passed, and it was evening again. Zhou Ze sat on the sofa, fiddling with a pen in his hand. There was still no news from the little loli.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think the other party was slacking off. After all, her life and death were in his hands. If, the first time he told her to do something, she dared to slack off, pretending to \"biu\" and then secretly return to sleep and recover, then he could only \"send her to win.\"*\n\nActually, how important could the ashes from his past life be? Not that important. In fact, if the ashes were in his possession and someone suggested scattering them in the ocean or a large river, Zhou Ze might even do it.\n\nLet bygones be bygones, let the past return to dust. Zhou Ze wasn't like protagonists in melodramatic dramas, valuing something from the past more than his own life.\n\nBut the problem was, his own possessions, and things deeply connected to him – he could discard them, but if someone dared to steal them, that was unacceptable.\n\nThis was no longer a question of material loss; it was the most direct form of affront.\n\nThat priest, that Japanese priest, Zhou Ze earnestly hoped to find him the next moment, then personally pierce him with his fingernails;\n\nDidn't he want the ashes?\n\nThen after I kill him, I'll turn him into ashes too, and mix in some dog shit for him.\n\nThe little loli must still be searching, and Zhou Ze knew that as an experienced ghost catcher, her roots in Tongcheng were definitely much deeper than his own.\n\nSo, however unwilling he was, the only thing Zhou Ze could do now was eat when he should, sleep when he should, maintaining his energy while waiting.\n\nLao Dao could tell that Zhou Ze's mood hadn't been very good all day.\n\nMost people couldn't possibly enjoy the anger of having their ashes stolen,\n\nBut the boss enjoyed it.\n\nAt this moment, Lao Dao brought over a cup of coffee, feeling that he should say something to alleviate the boss's depressed mood, and immediately said:\n\n\"Boss, that Japanese guy will definitely be found soon. Generally, in Chinese film, television, and novels, Japanese people are standard high-risk creatures** with short lifespans.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't look at Lao Dao but picked up the coffee and took a sip.\n\nHe didn't want to chat much with Lao Dao when he was in a bad mood, because he was afraid that he might, at any moment, have the urge to stab Lao Dao to death. Perhaps, his previous boss also had such an impulse?\n\nAt this moment, Tang Shi came downstairs. She was wearing a black dress today.\n\nThis was a cold and stunning woman, always pursuing high standards and refinement in her clothing and appearance. This seemed to be a kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder for her. Zhou Ze remembered that when she had just awakened, she had asked Lao Dao to buy her new clothes to change into.\n\n\"Let's go for tea.\"\n\nTang Shi said coldly.\n\n\"I don't think I'll go.\" Zhou Ze really wasn't in the mood.\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nStanding there, she didn't move.\n\nShe wouldn't act coquettishly, nor would she beg people. She always maintained that cold demeanor, and because of this, when she looked at you, you would feel very uncomfortable and ill at ease.\n\nZhou Ze was a soft-hearted person, and also a kind person.\n\nHe couldn't stand seeing others wronged or unhappy, always putting himself in their shoes.\n\nOf course, the pen he was fiddling with in his hand, having just slipped from his control, was already subtly trembling, poised to pierce his chest at any moment.\n\nHm,\n\nHe got up.\n\n\"Let's go, have some tea,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nTang Shi withdrew her gaze, pushed open the shop door, and walked out.\n\n\"Boss, it's a bit cool tonight, bring more clothes.\" Lao Dao said solicitously from the side.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, indicating that he didn't need to.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze also pushed open the door,\n\nAnd then,\n\nThere was no \"then.\"\n\nBecause Tang Shi was standing motionless by the utility pole at the doorway, not like she had called a car and was waiting for it. Zhou Ze could only stand beside her, not knowing what she meant.\n\nHalf an hour later,\n\nTang Shi was still standing there, motionless, not even changing her expression. Zhou Ze began to squat down and took out a cigarette.\n\nAn hour later,\n\nTang Shi remained motionless. Zhou Ze, on the other hand, simply sat on the curb, the ground around him already littered with cigarette butts.\n\nLooking at the bookstore door less than two meters away from him,\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to grab a hammer, \"crack open\" the girl's head, and ask what she was thinking.\n\n\"You've been standing less than two meters from the doorway waiting for so long, why couldn't you just wait inside the bookstore?\"\n\nInside the shop, Lao Dao, Bai Yingying, and Xu Qinglang occasionally passed by, seeing the boss still sitting outside. They looked again, and he was still sitting outside.\n\nZhou Ze slightly raised his head, then lowered it again,\n\nSuddenly, he had the illusion that life was very difficult.\n\nFinally, a white Roewe drove over and stopped in front of the bookstore.\n\n\"They're here?\"\n\n\"The people for tea?\"\n\nBecause Zhou Ze saw Tang Shi move; she walked forward.\n\nZhou Ze also stood up, watching the car door open, thinking whether he should organize the staff, who were watching his predicament for a laugh, to all wear bikinis, hold pompoms, spread their legs, and cheer a few times:\n\n\"Welcome, welcome, a warm welcome...\"\n\nBut it seemed only Yingying would be worth a look; the other two... wait, no, it seemed aside from Lao Dao, the other two would actually look quite good and be easy on the eyes dressed like that.\n\nBut then, Zhou Ze froze. There was only one person in the car, the driver, but when the driver got out, he gave off a feeling of excessive indulgence.\n\nHeavy dark circles under his eyes, coupled with that over-excited state, made it easy for one to wonder if this guy was high on drugs while driving.\n\n\"Hahahahaha...\"\n\nAs soon as the driver got out of the car, he clutched his stomach, laughing.\n\nHe laughed like a pig.\n\nZhou Ze approached him, lowered his head, and looked at him.\n\n\"Hahahahaha... Where is this?\" the driver asked, still laughing.\n\n\"Tongcheng,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe other party spoke with a Sichuan accent***,\n\nHe must be a friend from Sichuan.\n\n\"Hahahahaha... Where's Tongcheng? Never heard of it.\"\n\n\"In Jiangsu,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Hahahahaha... I drove out to buy a condom, how did I end up driving non-stop all the way to Jiangsu?\"\n\n\"You ask me? Who should I ask?\"\n\nZhou Ze felt like there was something wrong with this driver's brain.\n\nAlright,\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had guessed if the person Tang Shi wanted to meet for tea might be *that* one,\n\nBut if *that* one was like this in front of him,\n\nZhou Ze would want to join in with the \"hahahaha\"s too.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, I'm so tired, I'm so sleepy.\" The driver continued to \"hahahaha.\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, can you fucking stop laughing?\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, I can't! I don't know why I'm so happy!\" the driver.\n\n\"Hahahaha, are you out of your mind?\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Hahahaha, yeah, yeah, I drove over two thousand kilometers non-stop from Rongcheng**** to this Tongcheng. My brain really does seem to be sick.\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, what exactly are you here for?\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, there's someone in my trunk! I think he's my biological father or mother. I happily brought him here!\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha... Huh?\"\n\nZhou Ze stopped laughing and looked at the trunk.\n\nThen he saw Tang Shi raise her hand,\n\nThe entire car shook,\n\nScreeching and creaking,\n\nWithout pressing the unlock button, the trunk popped open directly.\n\nAlthough this white Roewe had become somewhat dusty and drab after its two-thousand-kilometer long journey, Tang Shi's manner of violently opening the trunk without even waiting to unlock it was still a bit excessive.\n\nIn the trunk, lay a person,\n\nOh no,\n\nMore precisely,\n\nIt was a person and a cat.\n\nThis person had bandages wrapped around their eyes, from which a little blood had seeped. Next to that person, there was also a cat lying motionless.\n\nBoth the person and the cat seemed dead, with only the slight rise and fall of their chests telling onlookers that they still had a breath left.\n\nTang Shi personally bent down, picked up the white cat, then looked towards inside the house.\n\n\"Lao Dao.\"\n\n\"Coming! What's up?\"\n\nLao Dao jogged over, then glanced at the trunk, was immediately startled, and quickly came to pick up the person inside with bandages wrapped around their eyes.\n\n\"Boss, how did you end up like this? You're so miserable, so miserable!\"\n\nZhou Ze, standing to the side, knew that Lao Dao wasn't crying for him,\n\nBut standing there listening to such wails still felt somewhat uncomfortable.\n\nThe person and the cat were carried into the bookstore by Tang Shi and Lao Dao, while the driver was still there, leaning on the car door, continuing to \"hahahahaha...\"\n\nZhou Ze somewhat understood now. This driver was truly unlucky; he had been hypnotized.\n\nHe went out to buy a condom, probably with a woman already waiting for him at the hotel, but he ended up driving non-stop from Rongcheng (Chengdu) all the way to Tongcheng.\n\nBut how does one undo hypnosis?\n\nFortunately, once the people in the car were carried inside, the driver seemed to return to normal, immediately collapsing to the ground and falling into a deep sleep.\n\nFinally, the driver was sent by Xu Qinglang to a nearby hotel for a room. As for whether the hotel owner would misunderstand anything, Zhou Ze had no idea.\n\nHe went straight upstairs, arriving at Tang Shi's bedroom. The man was lying there, motionless.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze felt quite grateful to him. If it weren't for his killing spree in Rongcheng (Chengdu), his relationship with the little loli wouldn't have become so harmonious.\n\nPerhaps he would now be facing the little loli's pursuit or would have already been killed.\n\n\"Can he wake up?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nTang Shi didn't answer. She personally took a wet towel and wiped his face.\n\nCarefully, and submissively.\n\nWhy didn't I get this treatment when I was injured?\n\nWe're all souls possessing bodies, and my Xu Le is much more handsome than this guy, okay?\n\n\"I don't mean anything else. I just want to ask, if he stays here, will it attract the attention of ghost catchers from other places, leading to another group of people coming to besiege him?\n\nDon't misunderstand, I don't intend to drive him away, I'm just asking so we can make some preparations.\n\nAfter all, you don't have ghost catcher permits, so your identities can't be cleared for now.\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"Ghost catcher permit?\"\n\n\"Are you truly ignorant or just pretending to be?\"\n\nZhou Ze took out his ghost catcher permit and waved it in front of Tang Shi,\n\n\"It's this thing. With it, you can clear your identity. As long as you don't do anything excessive afterward, you can live peacefully for a long time. It's just that this thing is quite hard to get; you need luck to obtain it.\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThe man lying unconscious on the bed slightly trembled,\n\nFrom his hoodie pocket,\n\nSomething seemed to scatter out,\n\nFalling from the bed onto the floor,\n\nLittering the ground,\n\nIt was a ground full of,\n\nGhost catcher permits.\n\n---\n* \"Send her to win\" (送她贏) is a Chinese internet meme, sarcastically implying sending someone to their doom or death.\n** This refers to a common trope in Chinese media where Japanese characters, often antagonists, have short lifespans or are easily defeated.\n*** \"Sichuan accent\" is used for 川普 (Chuānpǔ), a common informal term for Sichuan Mandarin.\n**** Rongcheng (蓉城) is an informal name for Chengdu.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang sat on a sofa, smoking, a glass of iced beer in front of him.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, picked up the beer, and downed it in one go.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Xu Qinglang knew Zhou Ze didn't usually drink.\n\n\"It's like how you showed off having over twenty apartments to that corgi girl last time.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nAfter a period of silence, Xu Qinglang poured Zhou Ze another drink. The two men sat quietly.\n\n\"Let me tell you something. I meant to tell you yesterday, but I wasn't in the mood.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the mood now either.\"\n\n\"So what if your ashes were stolen? It's like a pervert collecting your old toenail clippings. What's there to dwell on?\"\n\n\"Easy for you to say.\"\n\n\"I'm actually quite envious of you. I think if one day I could be drinking and feeling sentimental about my ashes being stolen, I'd be laughing out loud in bed.\"\n\nXu Qinglang wore a serious expression.\n\nYes,\n\nIf it were one's ancestral grave being dug up, or parents' ashes stolen by an enemy, then one would certainly be furious and anxious!\n\nBut it seemed no one had ever been anxious about their *own* ashes being stolen.\n\n\"So, should I post something on Weibo, bragging about it in a low-key, luxurious, yet profound way?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Heh, just kidding. By the way, have you found the thief?\"\n\n\"Little Loli is still looking.\"\n\nZhou Ze could only wait for news now.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang both looked towards the stairwell. Old Daoist was carrying a man down the stairs.\n\n\"What happened?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nTang Shi, who was following behind, didn't bother with Zhou Ze. A taxi was parked outside. Tang Shi and the man got into the taxi together. It looked like they were leaving.\n\nThey had just arrived and were already leaving, and the man was still unconscious.\n\nThe crucial thing was that he had even \"trembled\" while unconscious, scattering Underworld Messenger IDs all over the floor.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't even had a chance to wait for him to wake up and chat a bit before they were ready to leave.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze didn't try to keep them, because both sides understood that they weren't the kind of people who were polite, reserved, or fond of pleasantries.\n\nStay if you want to stay,\n\nLeave if you want to leave,\n\nNo need to play coy or put on a show.\n\nThe taxi drove off, but to Zhou Ze's surprise, Old Daoist came back inside. He actually didn't leave.\n\nZhou Ze had thought Old Daoist would go with them.\n\nOld Daoist walked back into the shop as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Hey!\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\nOld Daoist turned his head to Zhou Ze, smiling good-naturedly, and said:\n\n\"Boss, Miss Tang has left with Mr. Liang. Miss Tang had already arranged new accommodations. They're going to Shanghai. She said now that they have their documents, it's not convenient to bother you anymore.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you go with them?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I am your loyal Old Daoist!\"\n\nOld Daoist said this with a righteous expression.\n\n\"Tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"I can't leave you, I can't let you go.\"\n\n\"The truth.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at his fingernails.\n\n\"Given Mr. Liang's current state, the Netherworld Shop can't open anytime soon. I'd have nothing to do if I went with them, so I can only continue helping you here.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, walking over to his bar counter. Business had been good these past few days, sending many ghosts down, so he had accumulated a lot of netherworld money.\n\nHe pulled out half, handed it to Old Daoist,\n\n\"Give it to them. They're new to the place; they must be short on cash.\"\n\nZhou Ze worried that if Tang Shi was short on cash, she might just go rob a bank. That woman was capable of anything.\n\nNetherworld money could be used as consumables or like a bank card; burning it would make money drop at your door.\n\nUnexpectedly, Old Daoist shook his head directly, saying:\n\n\"Boss, Mr. Liang is very rich. He has many villas in Shanghai, properties all over the country, and he's hidden many boxes of 'small gold fish'.¹\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nHis heart,\n\nached, suffocating him...\n\nZhou Ze felt he had suffered two critical blows within an hour,\n\nand both were invisible.\n\nPutting the money back, Zhou Ze silently sat down.\n\nJust then, a girl ran in through the doorway. The girl was dressed in rags, almost to the point of being scarcely clothed.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nIn this day and age, under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, the living standards of all people across the nation are continuously rising, and both their material and spiritual lives are constantly being enriched and fulfilled.\n\nWith new policies for a new era,\n\nand the help of precise poverty alleviation measures, impoverished households could also receive significant assistance. One could say that the era of all people achieving moderate prosperity was not far off.\n\nEven in some cities there might be beggars, but it was truly rare these days to see a beggar so wretched as to be barely clothed.\n\nOld Daoist was still wiping the table, seemingly not noticing the little girl enter.\n\nThe Little Monkey, however, jumped directly onto Old Daoist's head, its two monkey paws gripping Old Daoist's head, making him look towards the little girl.\n\n\"A ghost is here?\"\n\nOld Daoist muttered to himself as he took out some ox tears² from his pocket and applied them to his eyes.\n\nThere was no other way; in this bookstore, he was the only one who couldn't directly see ghosts.\n\nSeeing the dirty little girl, Old Daoist instinctively looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, we have customers! Time to entertain guests!\"\n\nHis old voice shouted,\n\nas if dreaming of returning to ancient Yingchun Tower.³\n\n\"Girls, time to entertain guests!\"\n\n\"Coming, Mama!\"\n\nXu Qinglang stood up, preparing cold dishes and drinks. Zhou Ze motioned for the girl to follow him.\n\nThe girl seemed a little dazed and somewhat afraid. She looked at Zhou Ze, then at Old Daoist, but still instinctively followed Zhou Ze into the private room.\n\nZhou Ze sat down and gestured for the other person to sit as well.\n\nThe girl sat down. Xu Qinglang also brought out a few cold dishes, some small side dishes, and a steamed bun.\n\nWhen he was about to pour alcohol, Zhou Ze motioned for him not to.\n\nAlthough she was a ghost, she was still a child.\n\nAnd from the little girl's demeanor, it was clear she wasn't some kind of Heavenly Mountain Child Matron⁴.\n\nThe girl began to devour the food,\n\nclearly \"starved.\"\n\nAnd this hunger seemed more like she had been \"starving\" even when alive.\n\nZhou Ze sat silently, watching the girl eat.\n\nWhen the girl finished eating, a satisfied smile appeared on her face. She said:\n\n\"I'm so full, it feels so good to be full.\"\n\nThe girl's words carried a strong local accent from Tongcheng.\n\nChildren these days might not even be able to speak their local dialect, usually speaking standard Mandarin.\n\n\"You've eaten your fill, now it's time to go.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to open the gates of hell.\n\nThe little girl looked at Zhou Ze with some fear, but she didn't cry or make a fuss. She just waited quietly.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Xu Qinglang, who had been watching the little girl eat, suddenly spoke. \"Want some meat?\"\n\nThe little girl froze for a moment, then her eyes lit up, and she nodded repeatedly.\n\n\"Then wait.\"\n\nHe said this to both the little girl and Zhou Ze.\n\nAlright, Old Xu wanted to be a good person, a great philanthropist. Zhou Ze had no reason to stop him, so he continued to sit there.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes, Xu Qinglang brought out a plate of braised pork. The little girl continued to eat.\n\nIn reality, ghosts eat offerings and incense. The little girl seemed to devour the food like a whirlwind, but to an ordinary person, the dishes on the table hadn't been touched at all.\n\n\"Does the meat taste good?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Delicious, delicious,\" the little girl said.\n\n\"Are you having a sudden surge of maternal love today?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, curious.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, a faint sorrow clouding his brows. Since returning yesterday, he had maintained this melancholic Lin Daiyu⁵ aura.\n\nA man,\n\nhaving \"lost his innocence,\"\n\ncould be so resentful, as if life had lost its meaning.\n\nZhou Ze felt he should be glad there wasn't a well in the bookstore, otherwise Empress Xu⁶ might have chosen to perish like a fading fragrance and shattered jade.\n\nThe little girl finished eating,\n\nthen patted her belly,\n\nand looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis time she was very well-behaved; she became obedient after eating her fill, a very sensible child.\n\nShe knew she was about to embark on her journey.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, and while opening the gates of hell, he asked:\n\n\"Go in now.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask for her story. Perhaps he had heard too many stories in the past, so Zhou Ze had become less fond of listening to them.\n\nMost deceased people have their own sad stories.\n\nThe little girl blinked, looking at Zhou Ze, and asked:\n\n\"Can I eat my fill before going in?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Then I'll go call everyone. The villagers are all hungry; I want everyone to be able to eat their fill.\"\n\nZhou Ze's hand, which was opening the gates of hell, trembled.\n\nThere were \"more people\" to call?\n\nThis meant there was a big wave of potential business to secure!\n\nSubconsciously, Zhou Ze closed the gates of hell that he had just opened.\n\nBoss Zhou was in the initial stage of his career, urgently needing performance to prove himself, so he naturally understood the principle of casting a long line to catch a big fish.\n\n\"Where is your home?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Sanxiang Village,\" the little girl replied.\n\n\"Where is Sanxiang Village? Which district? Rugao, Menhai, or Chongchuan Gangzha?\"\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze had been reincarnated, he was from Tongcheng in his previous life, yet he couldn't recall a place called Sanxiang Village in Tongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, who shook his head, indicating he didn't know either.\n\n\"I don't know.\" The girl didn't know where Sanxiang Village was, and she had never heard the names of the districts Zhou Ze mentioned.\n\n\"Then...\"\n\nZhou Ze was at a loss, only able to continue asking:\n\n\"Can you go back the way you came?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head ignorantly. \"I don't know how I walked out of the village, and then I kept walking and walking, and I ended up here.\"\n\nShe couldn't go back the way she came either?\n\nZhou Ze even began to suspect the girl might have come from a neighboring city, a ghost that had crossed into the wrong territory. But then he thought it over and realized that wasn't right; the girl spoke with a Tongcheng accent, so it was unlikely she was from somewhere else.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was struggling, Xu Qinglang on the side took out his phone and searched.\n\n\"Did you find it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"I didn't find any information on this administrative village.\"\n\n\"Not even searchable online?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\n\"Wait, there's a post here that mentions 'Sanxiang Village'.\"\n\nXu Qinglang gestured for Zhou Ze to wait, then clicked on the post and said:\n\n\"The title of this post is:\n\n'Asking anyone knowledgeable⁷:\n\nIs there a place called Sanxiang Village in Tongcheng?'\"\n\n\"What about the replies below?\" Zhou Ze pressed.\n\n\"None.\n\nDon't know.\n\nNever heard of it.\n\nNo.\n\nNever heard of it.\n\nAbove +1...\"\n\nXu Qinglang kept flipping pages, then froze. He looked down for a while before looking up at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What did you find?\"\n\n\"There's a reply here: 'My grandma told me when I was little that she was from Sanxiang Village, but when she was ten, she followed her maternal grandmother back to her old home in Xingdong Town.\n\nA few days later, when she went back, she found the village... gone.'\"\n\n\"Gone?\" Zhou Ze was startled.\n\nGone,\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\n\"Someone asked for clarification below,\" Xu Qinglang said. \"I'll look for that person's reply again... Found it. He replied to the person's question, saying:\n\n'That year was 1938. You can imagine why the village was gone.'\"\n---\n¹ **Small gold fish (小金魚):** A euphemism for gold bars, ingots, or other valuable treasures, often used in a humorous or understated way.\n² **Ox tears (牛眼淚):** In Chinese folklore, applying a special potion made from ox tears is believed to allow one to see ghosts or spirits.\n³ **Yingchun Tower (迎春樓):** A common name for a brothel in historical Chinese fiction, used here to evoke a humorous image of Old Daoist as a brothel madam.\n⁴ **Heavenly Mountain Child Matron (天山童姥):** A powerful, ageless character from Jin Yong's wuxia novels, who appears as a child.

    "content": "1938?\n\nZhou Ze looked at the little girl, then at Xu Qinglang, and said, \"The Japs entered Tongcheng in '38, right?\"\n\nXu Qinglang thought for a moment, and said, \"I think they entered Tongcheng in March of '38.\"\n\nIn that case, the so-called Sanxiang Village was likely a tragedy of that era. The village was probably razed when the Japs entered Tongcheng, and virtually everyone in the village, including this little girl, perished. Only the grandmother of the original poster was lucky enough to escape.\n\nEven today, there's no way to find any other information about Sanxiang Village online, nor are there any official records.\n\nThis isn't due to official negligence; rather, in that era, countless similar tragedies occurred. Under years of continuous turmoil, many who died tragically were, in fact, forgotten.\n\n\"So, an entire village that died during the Anti-Japanese War didn't enter reincarnation?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nIt's been eighty years, over sixty years. Are the souls of this entire village still lingering there?\n\n\"I'm not sure, but looking at this little girl, it seems that way. How about this, I'll go to the Municipal Library and check the local gazetteers to see the exact location of Sanxiang Village, or consult relevant people.\"\n\nXu Qinglang got up, grabbed his car keys, and left immediately.\n\nHe was very proactive about this matter. His proactiveness differed from Zhou Ze's in that Zhou Ze still had performance metrics involved, while he simply wanted to do something from the bottom of his heart. After all, they were all fellow townspeople.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a nearby chair, pointed at the Old Taoist, and said, \"Watch her.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist nodded, watching the little girl with Little Monkey.\n\nThe little girl seemed bewildered, not knowing what was happening, just standing there instinctively, not daring to move much.\n\nLittle Monkey reached out as if to touch the girl's soul, but the Old Taoist immediately slapped his hand down and scolded:\n\n\"What are you touching for? She's older than me!\"\n\nIf the little girl hadn't died, she would be ninety years old now.\n\nBut she was still so innocent and naive, completely retaining her pre-death mentality. This was what Zhou Ze was most curious about. Zhou Ze guessed that something might have gone wrong with that village, trapping all the souls inside, unable to leave, oblivious to the seasons and the passing of time.\n\nHowever, the exact situation could only be verified after Xu Qinglang found precise information.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and casually scrolled. He rarely used things like WeChat or QQ, as they contained Xu Le's old social network, which couldn't be helped, especially since he couldn't retrieve his old accounts and it was difficult to appeal.\n\nWhile scrolling through Moments, Zhou Ze was surprised to see Bai Yingying had shared an article titled \"On the Bed Skills of Men in the Military!\"\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment.\n\nThis female corpse seemed to be running further and further down the path of a girl with middle-schooler syndrome.\n\nIt seemed he needed to find time to have a good talk with her; such things shouldn't be touched or shared, as they were taboo.\n\nAt this time, Bai Yingying had finished her work and was playing PUBG in her room upstairs, not downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze then got up, walked up the stairs, and casually clicked on the shared link as he went.\n\nHmm,\n\nTo educate a girl with middle-schooler syndrome, one must apply the right remedy; \"know yourself and your enemy, and you will never be defeated.\"\n\nAfter clicking in,\n\nthere was a pile of white and green pictures,\n\nand then,\n\nit turned out to be a quilt-folding competition at a certain factory, and all the top three winners were masters who had previously served in the military.\n\nWhat a wicked clickbait title!\n\nZhou Ze put down his phone and pushed open the bedroom door.\n\n\"Seaweed, seaweed, swaying with the waves;\nSeaweed, seaweed, seaweed, dancing in the waves!\"\n\nBai Yingying lay on the bed with her bare, pristine feet, swinging her legs back and forth, scrolling through videos on her phone, snorting like a pig with laughter as she scrolled.\n\nShe didn't even notice Zhou Ze walking over.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze sat down by her bed.\n\n\"Hahahaha...\"\n\nBai Yingying flipped over while laughing, then practically flopped onto Zhou Ze's lap.\n\nImmediately,\n\nher long eyelashes fluttered, her tempting red lips slightly closed and then parted, and her delicate skin faintly flushed.\n\nThe atmosphere,\n\nat this moment, became enchanting.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze, living up to his reputation as a destroyer of tranquility, directly said:\n\n\"I've told you many times, don't get on the bed without washing your feet and showering after waking up.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze looked at her long, bare, and infinitely suggestive delicate feet, and frowned:\n\n\"Dirty.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately got off the bed and put on her slippers, crossing her hands below her waist, lowering her head towards Zhou Ze, adopting a stance ready to be lectured.\n\nShe was quite familiar with this posture.\n\n\"Wash the bedsheets.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying gathered the bedsheets and went downstairs. Zhou Ze, meanwhile, sat in front of the computer, opened a webpage, and began to search for information about Sanxiang Village again.\n\nXu Qinglang had searched using his phone earlier, so there might have been some omissions.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nregarding that village, at least online, there was no other information apart from that discussion thread.\n\nZhou Ze also opened the thread Xu Qinglang had read earlier. The thread was posted on the Tongcheng local forum, dated 2009.\n\nHe first read the two replies stating that the grandmother was from Sanxiang Village, finding nothing new. Afterward, Zhou Ze chose to view the main topic again. In this thread, there were actually two people with information.\n\nOne was, of course, the replier, but they had already said everything they needed to. The other was the OP who posted the question.\n\nSince Sanxiang Village had been forgotten by people, not even existing in records, only in old stories told by grandmothers, why would this OP suddenly bring up this place name and ask about it?\n\nZhou Ze clicked on the OP's avatar and found that the OP had not posted anything since 2009. Zhou Ze copied the OP's ID.\n\nThe ID was \"Woxinchangdan Sanqian Yuejia Ketun Wu 19800201\"*.\n\nThe first part was quite familiar; Zhou Ze analyzed the string of numbers at the end might be the person's birthday.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze searched for this ID again and indeed found another post. This post was in the \"Penglai Ghost Stories\" section of the Tianya Forum.\n\nThe OP was still \"Woxinchangdan Sanqian Yuejia Ketun Wu 19800201\", and the post date was still 2009.\n\nThis thread didn't gain much traction, and there weren't many replies.\n\nNaturally, the ID numbers at the end were also the same, meaning that the person who posted about Sanxiang Village on the Tongcheng local forum was also the one who posted this story on the Tianya Forum.\n\nZhou Ze continued reading; it was a story.\n\nThe OP's opening stated:\n\n\"This is something I personally experienced. Although it's bizarre and absurd, I believe it wasn't a dream, nor was I hallucinating. This is my true story.\"\n\nA very cliché ghost story opening,\n\nvery prevalent in ghost story tropes ten years ago, where the opening first emphasizes the truth, almost too much.\n\nZhou Ze continued reading:\n\n\"This past March, I was driving home from the Guanyin Mountain Town Power Supply Office. Yes, I work at the power supply office, but my home is next to Xingdong Airport.\n\nOn my way home, I passed through Xingren Town and first exited the elevated road there, because that day I needed to pick up clothes I had left at the dry cleaner's that morning before work.\n\nThat dry cleaner's was located on Xingren Town's main street, directly across from Xingren Elementary School.\n\nIt was nine in the evening when I drove past; the streets were much less crowded. But when I parked my car in front of the dry cleaner's and stepped out, my foot twisted, and I fell directly.\n\nAt first, I just thought I was unlucky today, but this was only the beginning. Because after I fell to the ground, I suddenly realized that the streets and tall buildings around me were gone. Beneath me wasn't a road but a muddy field ridge, and across from me wasn't the dry cleaner's, but rows of mud houses.\n\nI was stunned. I looked back at my car and found that it had turned into a pile of straw.\n\nI was truly terrified at that moment. I didn't know what had happened. I sat on the ground for a quarter of an hour, constantly thinking it was a dream and hoping I would wake up soon.\n\nBut I didn't wake up. Then I saw an old man leading a little girl walking towards me. The old man had a hoe on his shoulder, and the little girl was playing with a sugar figure in her hand.\n\nThey got closer and closer. They were also talking, and they were speaking the Tongcheng dialect.\n\nI immediately asked them, \"Where is this?\"\n\nThey looked at me curiously. The old man replied that it was 'Sanxiang Village'.\n\n\"Where is Sanxiang Village?\"\n\nI'd never heard of it.\n\nThen I immediately stood up and asked them, \"How do I get out of here?\"\n\nThe old man probably thought I was crazy, that there was something wrong with my head, and hurried away, pulling his granddaughter with him.\n\nWith no other choice, I walked into the village alone. At the time, I even wondered if someone had drugged me and abducted me to some remote wilderness, but then I found it absurd—I'm a grown man, what would they abduct me for?\n\nI can't even have children.\n\nEvery household had its doors closed. Occasionally, a few houses had lights on with silhouettes inside. I didn't dare knock or enter, just walked cautiously past each door.\n\nI heard people in many houses chatting, and they were all crying out that they were hungry.\n\nWives cried out to their husbands that they were hungry,\n\nchildren cried out to their parents that they were hungry,\n\nelderly parents cried out to their sons and daughters-in-law that they were hungry.\n\nThe people in this village were all very hungry.\n\nAt night, inside their houses, they just kept talking about 'so hungry, so hungry'.\n\nThe further I walked, the more panicked I became.\n\nI had a feeling that since they were so hungry, they might all run out later and just cook and eat me.\n\nI started to run,\n\nrunning as fast as I could,\n\nI instinctively sensed danger,\n\nI needed to get out of there before they came out and caught me. No matter where I ran, I just had to get as far away from this damned village as possible.\n\nI don't know how long I ran,\n\nuntil finally,\n\nI just forgot...\n\nThen, when I woke up the next day,\n\nI found myself in the driver's seat of my car, having slept through the night.\n\nBut this was definitely not a dream; dreams couldn't be that real!\n\nAnd my clothes and pant legs were covered in mud,\n\nand there were a few bits of straw in my neck and hair.\n\nSanxiang Village,\n\nthat place must exist,\n\nit definitely exists!\"\n\nThe OP also posted photos from that time, showing the mud on his clothes, including the straw bits.\n\nBut the replies below clearly showed disbelief, saying:\n\n\"This ghost story is too ridiculous.\"\n\n\"The production cost is also very low. Just get some clothes dirty, take a picture, and play 'telling a story based on a picture'?\"\n\n\"Starting with one picture, and everything else is made up, OP. Not invested, not invested.\"\n\n\"OP, didn't you have your phone on you at the time? Why didn't you record or take pictures?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to scroll down.\n\nFortunately, there weren't many replies, because this ghost story was truly unoriginal and not particularly exciting.\n\nBut below, Zhou Ze saw a reply from the OP:\n\n\"Just wait, I will definitely find a way to go there again. This time, I'll bring back evidence to prove I'm not making up stories.\"\n\nThe next reply was from 2010, which was a year later.\n\n\"It's been a year, OP, where the hell's your story? Haven't you finished making it up yet? I've kept it in my favorites!\"\n\nThen in 2011, there was a reply:\n\n\"Two years have passed, did the OP ever go again?\"\n\nThe last reply was from 2012:\n\n\"Everyone, disperse. The OP is already dead.\"\n\nAs Zhou Ze read, he froze for a moment.\n\nA passage suddenly appeared in his mind:\n\n\"Nanyang's Liu Zijian, a noble scholar, heard of it, and gladly planned to go. He did not succeed, and soon fell ill and died. Afterwards, no one else inquired about it.\"\n\n---\n*   **Woxinchangdan Sanqian Yuejia Ketun Wu**: This is a Chinese idiom and historical allusion. \"Woxinchangdan\" means to \"sleep on brushwood and taste gall,\" referring to enduring hardships to achieve a goal. \"Sanqian Yuejia Ketun Wu\" means \"three thousand Yue soldiers can swallow Wu,\" referring to the ambition of King Goujian of Yue to conquer the State of Wu. Together, it signifies perseverance and determination in seeking revenge or achieving a great feat.",

    "content": "Bai Yingying returned, hugging the freshly washed bedsheets. The laundry was always dried on the second floor. Of course, Bai Yingying’s laundry speed was indeed very fast, but she definitely didn’t do it perfunctorily.\n\nShe knew that when it came to household hygiene, her boss had an almost obsessively strict compulsive disorder.\n\nIn short, he was hard to please.\n\nSometimes, Bai Yingying would also inwardly complain:\n\nThere was probably a reason her boss was an orphan abandoned by his parents in his previous life. It was likely that he wouldn't eat if his pacifier wasn't sterilized, wouldn't sleep if his bedding wasn't clean, wouldn't let his parents touch him if they didn't wash their hands, and then his parents simply couldn't take it anymore and threw him away.\n\nOf course, Bai Yingying only dared to mutter such complaints inwardly, absolutely never daring to voice them.\n\nShe also had to put on an obedient expression every time, then accompany her boss, hand in hand, towards the happy paradise of cleanliness, acting as if she had grasped the spirit of it and found it sweet and agreeable*.\n\nSuch was her cowardice.\n\nIf Heaven had not given birth to me, Bai Yingying, the path of cowardice would be an eternal night.**\n\nZhou Ze stood by the window smoking. He had read that post; it actually provided a lot of information.\n\nXingren Town, dry cleaner, the location should be right there.\n\nZhou Ze could even discern much information that wasn't in the post, because he was a Ghost Emissary, and no longer the greenhorn he once was; he had slowly begun to enter the trade and familiarize himself with the business.\n\nGhosts originate from humans, and humans are bound to become ghosts, but humans and ghosts are on separate paths. There is a line that separates them.\n\nThe Human World and the Underworld, coexisting yet opposing each other.\n\nWhat kind of people are likely to see ghosts?\n\nThere are those who have encountered special circumstances; that's one type.\n\nAnother large category are people who are about to die, whose lifespans are nearing their end, just like when your phone balance is low, your mobile carrier*** will constantly send you reminder texts.\n\nIt’s time; you should leave.\n\nAt that time, although you are still a living person, you are about to become a dead person, and the death aura on your body has already begun to intensify.\n\nThis intensification doesn't simply mean you are sick, or gravely ill; it might also mean you are about to encounter an accident, perhaps a car crash, or perhaps choking to death while eating or drowning while drinking.\n\nIn short, you're about to kick the bucket.\n\nThen you are very likely to see ghosts, and the auras between you and them begin to merge from opposition.\n\nCombining this with the fact that the OP had no active news after 2009, it can be roughly guessed that the OP was indeed dead.\n\nBut his description of Sanxiang Village and the experiences he recorded, along with the words of the little girl downstairs, had actually outlined the complete picture of the incident’s unfortunate unraveling.\n\nA village that was massacred in the year the Japanese army invaded Tongcheng, eighty years later, the people of that village—no, the ghosts of the entire village—were still trapped in an area, unable to reincarnate, unable to be reborn.\n\nThey also hadn't turned into vengeful ghosts; if they had, with eighty years to fester, the OP would have been done for when he first entered, and wouldn't have been able to get out.\n\nMoreover, the little girl was still innocent and naive, as if she had just died.\n\nWhat exactly was the reason that such a harmonious village appeared?\n\nAfter drying the bedding, Bai Yingying secretly sat down in front of the computer. The internet-addicted girl, while sizing up Zhou Ze, wanted to secretly play some games. Her gaze fixed on the screen, she naturally read through the short story once, then said:\n\n“Boss, isn’t this ‘The Peach Blossom Spring’?”\n\nZhou Ze nodded. “Yes, this is a twisted version of ‘The Peach Blossom Spring’.”\n\nAll along, people had naturally assumed that Tao Yuanming’s ‘The Peach Blossom Spring’ was a paradise hidden from the world. However, in reality, this seemingly beautiful story was filled with eeriness and sinisterness everywhere.\n\nIf you look at it from a different perspective, ‘The Peach Blossom Spring’ is entirely a ghost story, a tale of a fisherman accidentally entering a ghost village, just like the OP in the post.\n\nHis fingers trembled slightly by the windowsill. This was a place he had to go.\n\nNot to mention the temptation of becoming a full-time employee if he could send all the departed souls in that village to the Underworld, just the fact that they were his compatriots was enough for Zhou Ze to try and help.\n\nEighty years ago, when the nation was in peril, they became pitiful departed souls under the invaders’ butcher knives. They had suffered for eighty years; it was time for them to find release.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and dialed Xu Qinglang’s number.\n\nBut it showed as out of service. This surprised Zhou Ze. Shouldn’t Xu Qinglang be at the local library right now? Was the cell signal that bad there?\n\nAfter a while, Zhou Ze called again, but the call still couldn’t connect. Zhou Ze didn’t intend to wait. He directly gestured for Bai Yingying to mind the shop, then took the old Daoist priest with him in a taxi to Xingren Town.\n\nThe reason for bringing the old Daoist priest was simple: firstly, the old Daoist priest’s ability to supervise departed souls was not strong; apart from fondling his crotch, he had virtually no control over them, and that little girl’s departed soul needed Bai Yingying to watch over her.\n\nSecondly, the little monkey got along well with the old Daoist priest. This time, to find the entry point for the OP into Sanxiang Village, they needed the help of this creature.\n\nWith that thought in mind, Zhou Ze’s gaze fell upon the little monkey. The little monkey, originally lying on the old Daoist priest’s lap, suddenly lifted its head and bared its fangs at Zhou Ze.\n\n“Oh, it can understand my inner thoughts? Or, did it simply sense that I was cursing it?”\n\nZhou Ze reached out, grabbed the little monkey’s tail, avoiding the driver’s gaze, and stared at the little monkey.\n\nIt seemed to have grown a bit, and gotten heavier. Heh heh, its guts have grown bigger too.\n\nThe little monkey twisted its body in dissatisfaction. It had never been particularly fond of Zhou Ze, so in the bookstore, it usually played with the old Daoist priest. For Zhou Ze, it had a fear and apprehension deep in its bones.\n\nAfter all, the little monkey’s previous incarnation had been literally stabbed to death by Zhou Ze’s fingernails.\n\nIt and Zhou Ze, one person and one monkey, were like two intertwined lines, their karmic relationship a complete mess.\n\nArriving at the destination, after getting out of the car, Zhou Ze lightly stretched.\n\nXingren Town was a small town, close to the city, right next to the airport. And Zhou Ze’s location was to the east of Crossroads Street, also a small intersection.\n\nTo the due north was Xingren Elementary School, to the due south was an apartment building, and the street in the middle was lined with small shops.\n\nThe dry cleaner was still open there.\n\nAfter calculating the location, Zhou Ze began to simulate in his mind the scene of the OP driving, stopping here, and falling.\n\n“Boss, it should be in the direction of the elementary school, right?” the old Daoist priest said at this moment.\n\n“Oh?” Zhou Ze was a bit puzzled. He knew what level the old Daoist priest was at.\n\n“Heh heh, I didn’t see anything, but I have experience. Generally speaking, places like schools or hospitals are often built on mass burial grounds.\n\nBecause land is cheap, especially for places like schools, they don’t need to be in busy commercial districts; even if they’re a bit remote, it doesn’t matter.\n\nMoreover, it’s not just that school district housing is popular now; even many years ago, wherever a school was built, the area’s popularity would immediately rise. So, in urban planning, schools are often considered an important strategic placement, choosing a slightly remote location to drive its development.”\n\nThe old Daoist priest spoke logically and indeed made some sense.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the little monkey and asked, “Can you make anything out?”\n\nThe little monkey scratched its head, jumped down from the old Daoist priest, and began to search around. Then, it shook its head, looking bewildered.\n\nZhou Ze’s eyes narrowed slightly. He didn’t think the little monkey was slacking off.\n\nPerhaps it was because it wasn’t completely dark yet. Some places are suppressed during the day, but might reveal clues when night falls.\n\nSo, Zhou Ze and the old Daoist priest entered a nearby fast food restaurant, ordered some drinks and snacks, and sat there waiting.\n\nThe elementary school began to let out, and many vehicles gathered there. By the time school was dismissed, the sky had slowly darkened, and the surrounding area’s vibrancy gradually subsided.\n\nCalculating the time, it was almost right. For this kind of matter, there was no need to wait until midnight.\n\nLeading the little monkey out again, this time the little monkey seemed to immediately capture something, and began to circle continuously in place. The old Daoist priest also circled behind the little monkey.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, stood by and watched.\n\nFinally, the little monkey made “squeaking” sounds from its mouth, and then directly darted towards the road.\n\nJust then, a car happened to drive over. Its speed wasn’t actually fast, but the little monkey was essentially darting right into its wheels!\n\n“Screech!” The car slammed on its brakes. The driver cursed, “Whose dead dog is that!”\n\nThe driver got out to check. He had just seen a yellow furry mass dart in front of his car, but after getting out, he saw no bloodstains. He immediately cursed a few more times, got back in the car, and drove off.\n\nThe old Daoist priest was a bit slow on the uptake. When the little monkey darted out, he didn’t even have time to shout.\n\nBut at that moment, he also realized: the monkey hadn’t been hit by the car. To be precise, the monkey had gone *in*.\n\n“Boss, what should we do?” the old Daoist priest asked.\n\nZhou Ze remained in place, circled a few times along the area where the monkey had been circling, and then dashed in that direction. In an instant, Zhou Ze felt his fingernails tremble slightly, as if they had caught something, and he grabbed in response.\n\n“Buzz!” Immediately after, the surrounding environment began to twist. Tall buildings, roads, vehicles—all disappeared. This was a muddy field ridge, and not far away were rows of houses built with mud and straw.\n\nThe little monkey squatted in front of Zhou Ze, looking at him.\n\nZhou Ze looked around. He knew he had also entered.\n\nAs for the old Daoist priest, Zhou Ze estimated he couldn’t get in, unless he was about to kick the bucket and breathe his last; then, perhaps, he might happen to get in.\n\nIn the distance, a pair of grandfather and granddaughter walked over, a grandfather leading a little girl.\n\nThe little girl was somewhat similar to the one in his bookstore; if one looked closely, they might even think it was the same person.\n\nIt matched. It matched the OP’s description in the post.\n\n“Where is this?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\nAccording to the script, they should have answered that this was “Sanxiang Village.”\n\nBut the next scene made Zhou Ze pause. The grandfather didn’t answer, and neither did the girl. The old and the young, they just stared fixedly at Zhou Ze and the little monkey, saliva began to drool exaggeratedly from their mouths, while their eyes slowly began to glow red!\n\n“Hey, Director, the script, it seems to be the wrong one?”\n___\n*   **甘之如飴 (gān zhī rú yí)**: Literally \"find it as sweet as malt sugar.\" Meaning to bear hardships gladly or find something agreeable.\n**   **天不生我白鶯鶯，萬古慫道如長夜 (tiān bù shēng wǒ bái yīngyīng, wàngǔ sǒng dào rú chángyè)**: A parody of a famous line by Li Chungang (李淳罡), a character from the novel \"Sword Snow Stride\" (雪中悍刀行).

    "content": "The way things were developing seemed to slowly veer towards an uncontrollable direction; at least, Zhou Ze was not mentally prepared for this at the beginning.\n\nThe state the little girl displayed when she walked into his bookstore made Zhou Ze completely unprepared for the people in this village,\n\nOh no,\n\nIt was the ghosts in this village, that would turn out like this.\n\nHe had clearly come to deliver them, to save them,\n\nBut they were clearly treating him as food now.\n\nThe old man, hale and hearty, walked like the wind, wielding his hoe with a flavor of Chen Yaojin’s Three Axe Strikes*.\n\nAnd the little girl’s pigtails flew back, her face ferocious, speed rapid, shrieking incessantly.\n\nThis was the manifestation of a malevolent ghost; ordinary wandering souls couldn’t reach this level.\n\nAt present,\n\nThe old one lunged at Zhou Ze,\n\nWhile the young one lunged at Monkey.\n\nMonkey first wielded its plastic toy hammer, but seeing the menacing malevolent ghost, it immediately stood behind Zhou Ze.\n\nBeing timid,\n\nWas a belief,\n\nAnd had almost become a prevailing custom in the bookstore,\n\nEven animals were infected by it.\n\nOne must know that Monkey had previously treated Zhou Ze with an indifferent, disdainful attitude, but at this moment, it quickly decided to let bygones be bygones.\n\nAlthough things had changed, and the script seemed to be wrong,\n\nZhou Ze wasn’t so easily scared into helplessness by two malevolent ghosts.\n\nImmediately, he stepped forward, his fingernails extended, accompanied by wisps of black mist appearing around him.\n\nNowadays, after those two times entering that heavily injured zombie state, Zhou Ze’s use of his fingernails and the power they carried became increasingly adept.\n\nIt looked much better than when he first fought, clawing like a shrew tearing at someone with nails.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nWhen the black mist struck the old man and the little girl, their movements were as if a slow-motion button had been pressed, while Zhou Ze floated lightly between the two of them.\n\nHis robes fluttered,\n\nHe strolled with ease,\n\nBoth hands,\n\nSlowly descending towards the tops of their heads,\n\nLike an immortal caressing a head,\n\nEverything was under control.\n\nAt this moment, the only regret was probably that Old Taoist hadn’t come in; otherwise, the thoughtful Old Taoist would surely have helped him film this scene for future enjoyment.\n\nThen he would silently smoke a cigarette, expressing disdain,\n\nThe implication being: basic operation, sit down.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze’s fingernails pierced the heads of the grandfather and granddaughter, about to declare the end of it all,\n\nThe old man and the little girl’s bodies suddenly twisted, then completely dissipated.\n\nTheir speed,\n\nWas even faster than the little loli’s “biu”!\n\nZhou Ze’s hands were still suspended in the air,\n\nHis pose already struck,\n\nBut the people cooperating in the performance had spaced out,\n\nA little awkward.\n\nLowering his hands, Zhou Ze turned around, startled to find the figures of the grandfather and granddaughter reappearing on a distant path.\n\nThe grandfather carried his hoe and held his granddaughter’s hand,\n\nThe old and young pair seemed to have just returned from the fields,\n\nCarrying a sense of happiness and contentment,\n\nJust like in *The Peach Blossom Spring*† where it was recorded, “Old folks with hair turning yellow and children with braids dangling, all content and happy.”\n\nThe little monkey was also a bit dumbfounded; clearly, even its replenished monkey brain couldn’t understand what was happening at this moment.\n\nThe old and young pair walked closer again, the old man looked at Zhou Ze and asked curiously:\n\n“Young man, where are you from?”\n\n“I don’t know either.” Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThis time he really didn’t know.\n\n“Are you lost?” The old man was kind-hearted.\n\n“Kind of.” Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n“This is Sanxiang Village, not far from the city. If you follow this road south, you’ll reach the city.” The old man kindly gave directions.\n\nThe little girl played with the sugar figure in her hand, her figure a bit thin, but still innocent and lovely.\n\nThe image of this grandfather and granddaughter, and the image of them about to eat people, were simply two extremes.\n\n“Alright, got it.” Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nThe grandfather and granddaughter walked into the village, chatting and laughing.\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the sky; he hadn’t noticed before, but now he did: the moon in the sky seemed to be faintly glowing red at its edges.\n\nNine years ago, when that OP (original poster) first came here, the first scene he experienced should have been the same as what Zhou Ze experienced the second time; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to leave after his first entry, nor would he have been able to post.\n\nBut he had mentioned in his post that when he walked through the village at night, every household was saying things like how hungry they were and how much they wanted to eat; this meant that actually, nine years ago, the “hunger” in this village had already started to become problematic.\n\nAnd now, with his arrival nine years later, the problem had further fermented and worsened.\n\nFrom then on, if another “fisherman” accidentally stumbled in, he would likely no longer see a simple Peach Blossom Spring, but would only become food for the many departed souls in this village.\n\nThis place,\n\nHad gradually devolved into a place of ill omen.\n\nZhou Ze strode into the village; he needed to look around, to at least investigate what else had happened in this village back then, under the greater context of being massacred by the Japanese devils.\n\nWhen the nation was in peril, countless innocent souls died; why was it that only this village had been preserved in such a bizarre way?\n\nWhen something is abnormal, there must be a demon at play.\n\nThe houses in the village were all built of mud and straw; a few wealthier families would lay some tiles on their roofs, which was considered the common housing standard in rural areas eighty years ago.\n\nZhou Ze remembered seeing similar houses in the countryside of Tongcheng when he was a child, but those were ancestral homes, no longer inhabited.\n\nEvery household had its own fenced yard, all very tidy, even excessively so; generally, one could plant some green onions, ginger, garlic, or other small vegetables in the yard, but here, the yards were all barren and flattened, without even a blade of grass.\n\nAn old woman sat on a small stool by the door, doing needlework to make cloth shoes; she was very serious and engrossed in her work, but Zhou Ze saw from a distance that the old woman was actually drooling while doing her needlework.\n\nOn the ground,\n\nA large puddle had already accumulated.\n\nThis scene was quite eerie.\n\nThe old woman was completely oblivious; even though her saliva had soaked the shoe in her hand, she still went her own way, immersed in her own world.\n\nFortunately, when Zhou Ze and the little monkey walked past, she didn’t look up, but Zhou Ze didn’t dare to completely treat her as a bystander; with the precedent of the old man and the little girl, Zhou Ze knew that the people in this village could be overcome by hunger and directly turn into malevolent ghosts at any time.\n\nAhead was a well; a woman in her thirties or forties was drawing water. The woman had a good figure; though somewhat rustic, she would have been considered a standard rural beauty in that era.\n\nA tall stature, ample bosom, and full, round buttocks, exuding the most primitive and impulsive aura.\n\nBut when the woman turned around with the water bucket, Zhou Ze saw that her mouth was full of a black mass, which she was vigorously chewing.\n\nIt was her hair,\n\nShe was tearing and eating her own hair while drawing water; she was very hungry, terribly hungry.\n\nThe old woman making cloth shoes looked up at the woman drawing water and shouted:\n\n“Dead widow, your man’s dead, and you’re still dressed so flamboyantly. Your lower mouth must be very thirsty, eh?”\n\nThe woman called a widow didn’t back down, shouting directly: “Old Woman Cui, I’m not like you; your lower mouth can’t even spit out saliva anymore.”\n\n“Bah, you indecent thing, always thinking about men!”\n\n“I do think about it, I think about it every day! I wish all the men in the village would come to my bed tonight so I could eat them one by one.\n\nFried,\n\nSteamed,\n\nCold-tossed,\n\nTsk tsk,\n\nThe taste… I can’t take it, I can’t take it! I really want men!”\n\nAs the widow spoke, she chewed her hair even more vigorously,\n\nAnd the old woman seemed to be swayed, drooling even more profusely, with a look of longing on her face.\n\nZhou Ze walked between them; for some reason, these two women seemed not to have seen him at all, but after Zhou Ze and the little monkey had walked far away.\n\nThe old woman and the widow suddenly slowly raised their heads, both looking in the direction Zhou Ze had walked.\n\nIn their eyes, waves of crimson red appeared.\n\nThe few houses ahead looked a bit grander, with tiles on the roof and stone blocks at the entrance, signifying a prosperous household.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the courtyard; there was no one in the yard, but the smell of meat came from the kitchen. Zhou Ze walked over and lifted the window panel.\n\nInside was a rural earthen stove,\n\nA young man was feeding firewood into the back of the stove, the fire burning fiercely.\n\nBut there was nothing in the pot, just a large pot of boiling water constantly bubbling.\n\n“Wifey, the water’s boiling, come quickly!”\n\nThe man shouted towards the other side; he was a little impatient.\n\nJust like a newlywed husband urging his wife to hurry up and take a bath every night.\n\n“Coming, coming! Look at that desperate face of yours!\n\nYou’re never so diligent with other things, but so keen on this matter.”\n\nThe man ran out from behind the stove, embraced the woman, and shouted:\n\n“Quick, quick, quick! I can’t hold back, I can’t hold back!”\n\n“You wait.”\n\nThe woman took off her clothes,\n\nSeemingly not having noticed that there was someone standing by the window watching.\n\nAfter the woman removed her clothes, her fair and smooth back was revealed, but her right arm was already flushed red, like the pig’s head meat sold at a street food stall.\n\nThe woman directly climbed onto the stove, then sat into the scalding hot water, while pouring hot water over herself with a basin and cursing her husband:\n\n“Keep adding firewood, or it won’t cook thoroughly and won’t taste good! Look at you, you useless thing, put more effort into it, your old lady’s not feeling it!”\n\n“Alrighty!”\n\nThe husband immediately went to add firewood at the back,\n\nWhile the woman sitting in the pot boiled herself,\n\nAnd took a bite out of her right arm, which had already been cooked and braised beforehand.\n\nSquinting her eyes,\n\nShe said with continuous enjoyment:\n\n“So yummy!”\n\n---\n*Chen Yaojin's Three Axe Strikes: A popular Chinese idiom referring to a legendary general, Chen Yaojin, who was said to only know three impressive axe moves.

    "content": "A bland pace of life,\nA tranquil Republic of China era village atmosphere,\nDown-to-earth<sup>1</sup> cursing and clamor,\nMusical notes carrying the fragrance of soil.\n\nThis was its back, the back of Sanxiang Village, but once you took a few steps and ran to the front, you would be scared to death by its face.\n\nEvery detail here was like a crevice, and drops of fresh blood gurgled out from within, then submerged people, making them suffocate.\n\nA terrifying dark cloud had always enveloped above this village, just like a stage play, where every character seemed to be wearing a mask with profound meaning.\n\nWhat hung in the sky was clearly the moon;\nBut the light on the ground was an uneven, pallid white, as if an unqualified lighting engineer had adjusted the angle incorrectly, making everything very chaotic.\n\nSome people were sleeping,\nSome were cooking,\nSome were fetching water,\nSome were cursing,\nSome were laughing,\nAnd some were crying.\n\nZhou Ze had walked for a long time, almost having explored the entire village.\nWhat could be affirmed was that this place now was indeed completely different from when the original poster last came.\n\nIf, 9 years ago, when that original poster first arrived, this place was merely feigning reluctance while actually welcoming<sup>2</sup>, then now, it was truly like a giant tiger that had opened its mouth, and its tiger eyes were glaring at you.\nIt could eat you whenever it wanted,\nAnd that sense of waiting, of potentially being eaten at any moment, was the most agonizing and torturous.\n\nIf the original poster from nine years ago had seen this scene today, he probably wouldn't have had the courage to say he still wanted to come back to find evidence and take photos.\n\nAfter walking in a circle, Zhou Ze arrived outside an ancestral hall.\nThis ancestral hall was considered the building with the most distinguished class<sup>3</sup> in all of Sanxiang Village.\nIt wasn’t large,\nBut outside hung a plaque, and inside were carved beams and painted rafters; though small and a bit cramped, it exuded a sense of refinement and solemnity.\n\nA blind old man wearing a long gown sat at the entrance of the ancestral hall, holding a cane and continuously tapping the ground, his lips trembling slightly.\nZhou Ze stopped in front of him, because in Zhou Ze’s eyes, this old man was the most normal one in the entire village.\nAt least, the old man wasn’t drooling, nor was he dripping saliva.\n\nBut after getting closer,\nZhou Ze still heard the old man muttering to himself in a low voice:\n“Hungry, so hungry, truly hungry, really want to eat white mantou, really want to eat mantou.”\n\nThe little monkey darted up directly and grabbed the blind old man’s goatee.\nThe blind old man raised his head. He was blind, without sunglasses, but where his eyes should have been, there was a murky blur. At this moment, however, he must have sensed that there was someone in front of him, a stranger.\n\nHe licked his tongue, then swallowed a mouthful of saliva,\nAnd said:\n“Go, you go. Everyone, they’re about to lose control.”\n\nThe blind old man’s words were filled with a sense of vicissitude and helplessness.\nHe was reminding Zhou Ze,\nThat this place,\nWas a den of troubles<sup>4</sup>; the people here were all very hungry.\nOne by one, hungry ghosts<sup>5</sup> were about to be unleashed!\nIf you didn’t leave now, you wouldn’t be able to.\n\nZhou Ze still didn’t move. To be honest, he wasn’t very afraid of the fierce ghosts here. Even with such a large number, he was actually a bit overwhelmed, but there was a big difference between not being able to win and not being able to escape.\nZhou Ze believed he still had a good chance of escaping no matter what.\n\n“What exactly is going on here?”\nZhou Ze asked.\nHe hoped to get an answer—how had the people in this village become like this?\nIn fact,\nThe darkness and blood moon above the village already explained many problems. The village was a malevolent land<sup>6</sup>; many ancient battlefield ruins would exhibit such phenomena.\n\n“Don’t ask, don’t ask, go. Everyone is very hungry, very hungry. If you don’t go, you’ll be eaten.”\nThe blind old man kept repeating these same few phrases, talking incessantly.\n\n“Hungry? Were you starved to death?”\nImpossible!\nHow could an entire village be starved to death? If there was no food, wouldn’t they go out to flee from famine?\nAnd that granny online, who was formerly from Sanxiang Village, had replied that this village was massacred on the day the \"devils\"<sup>7</sup> broke into Tongcheng. What did that have to do with hunger then?\n\n“Go, get out!”\nThe blind old man became angry,\nHis cane kept poking the ground.\n“Go! Go!”\n\nZhou Ze still didn’t move, which made the blind old man very anxious. Of course, while anxious, he also kept sniffing his nose. Evidently, he was craving!\n“If you don’t go, if you don’t go, you’ll be eaten.”\nThe blind old man’s voice began to get lower and lower.\nHe himself was also about to lose control.\n\nZhou Ze still didn’t move; he couldn’t leave without clarifying what was happening here.\nLiving people’s affairs were for the police to handle, but dead people’s affairs were his responsibility.\nThis village, previously, could still be called a “modern-day” Peach Blossom Spring<sup>8</sup>, but now, 9 years had passed, and it had begun to show a trend of gradually turning into a den of fierce ghosts.\n\nThat little girl was likely fortunate; she wasn’t polluted or greatly affected, and came to his bookstore.\nBut at the same time, the fact that the little girl appeared in the bookstore also indicated that the ghosts in Sanxiang Village, the situation here, had begun to change.\nNot only could people come in,\nGhosts,\nCould also go out!\n\nOnce so many fierce ghosts were suddenly released, how much impact and destruction would they cause?\nIf Zhou Ze didn’t know, it would be fine; at most, he’d deal with it in time, but he was already here.\nThe little loli once said that the Underworld had a set of scales.\nZhou Ze believed that if he let it go and left, his actions would be rated far worse by the Underworld than him coercing the little loli into being his subordinate.\n\nIn the Underworld’s view,\nGhost emissaries and constables were all the lowest-ranking civil servants. You could infight, compete for favor, or argue, but you had to get things done, and the work of maintaining stability was of utmost importance.\nControlling the situation well and preventing ghostly beings from affecting the human world—this was the most basic red line. Everything else was not a problem.\nTherefore, Zhou Ze couldn’t leave, even though he also smelled that the oppressive feeling in the air was getting stronger and stronger.\n\nBut what was most critical now was that if he didn’t know the secret of this village and the reason for its formation, Zhou Ze simply couldn’t resolve it.\nJust like the old man and the little girl he encountered when he first came in, after being killed by Zhou Ze, they instantly returned to their previous state.\nIn this place, Zhou Ze simply couldn’t kill them, let alone capture them for performance.\n\n“Go!”\nThe blind old man suddenly stood up, extending his cane towards Zhou Ze.\nZhou Ze reached out, grabbed the cane, and two of his fingernails directly embedded into the cane.\n“Ahhhhhhh!!!!!”\n\nThe blind old man let out a low growl, then opened his mouth and directly bit towards Zhou Ze.\nZhou Ze took a step back, turned sideways, and entered the ancestral hall, while the blind old man was thrown back and fell, rolling down the ancestral hall steps.\n\nBut next, the blind old man directly lay prone on the ground, supporting himself with both hands and feet, his belly bulging.\n“Thump!”\nThe blind old man jumped over again.\nZhou Ze spread his hands, black mist swirled around, directly trapping the blind old man, but Zhou Ze didn’t stab him directly with his fingernails; instead, he reached out and patted his face,\nAnd asked:\n“Tell me, what exactly happened to this village!”\n\n“Ahhhhhhh!!!!!”\nHowever, the blind old man seemed to have completely lost his mind. He struggled incessantly, trying to break free from Zhou Ze’s restraints and bite Zhou Ze.\nThere was no other way, Zhou Ze could only kick him again, sending the other party flying.\n\nJust like last time, the blind old man bounced up again after landing. From the corners of his mouth, black liquid kept bubbling out. Inside it, there were also fragments of tree bark and grass roots.\nEvidently, for a long time, he was so hungry that he had to fill his belly with these things.\n\nAnd at this moment,\nIt was unknown when, but outside the ancestral hall, one villager after another slowly began to gather. One by one, their expressions were numb, and they stumbled over to gather.\nThere was the old man carrying a hoe,\nThere was the little girl holding a sugar figurine,\nThere was the widow eating her own hair,\nThere was the old woman holding cloth shoes in her hand,\nThere was the young couple eating their own flesh,\nThere were many, many people.\nOne by one, they gathered at the entrance of the ancestral hall,\nTheir gazes fixed directly on Zhou Ze. They were hungry, they were very, very hungry.\n\nThe little monkey shuddered in fright, directly leaping onto the ancestral hall’s altar table, trembling.\nSo many fierce ghosts,\nToo terrifying,\nThe malevolent aura emanating from them was enough to suffocate people. When they stood there, it seemed as if a dark cloud gathered in the sky.\n\nZhou Ze gritted his teeth and asked:\n“I know you’re very hungry, but I really want someone whose mind is still clear enough to speak to come forward and tell me what exactly is wrong with you.\nI’m here to help you, to free you from your suffering. Even, even if you’ve become like this now, it’s not completely impossible to reincarnate!”\n\nZhou Ze said very seriously and sincerely,\nMoreover,\nThe place that hadn’t hurt for a long time now began to ache.\nZhou Ze subconsciously reached out and clutched his chest.\nHe had almost forgotten its existence.\nIt hadn’t hurt for a long time.\nTang Shi had told him before she left that he had become accustomed to living heartlessly<sup>9</sup>. So now, was he starting to have a conscience again?\nYes,\nHe had a conscience now,\nBecause Zhou Ze couldn’t bear to completely destroy the last hope of the people in this entire village. Eighty years ago, they were already very tragic, just like the three hundred thousand departed souls of Nanjing.\nTherefore, as long as there was a glimmer of possibility, Zhou Ze still hoped they could have a chance to re-enter reincarnation.\n\nIt was precisely for this reason that Zhou Ze held onto a hopeful thought, attempting to find another clear-minded person in this village to obtain some clues.\nNow, he was surrounded by the entire village, having lost the opportunity to advance and retreat freely that he had previously possessed.\nIf he wanted to break out, he could, but he’d probably have to enter that state again amidst the fierce ghosts’ biting,\nAnd then he would be paralyzed and severely injured for a long time.\nThis was very uneconomical,\nAnd very foolish,\nIt was a stupid action and choice,\nSo his conscience hurt again.\n\n“Roar!”\n“Hungry!”\n“Eat him!”\n“Eat!”\nNo one seriously responded to Zhou Ze’s words.\nThey swarmed forward together, rushing over.\n\nZhou Ze’s ten fingernails danced incessantly. One fierce ghost after another was fiercely knocked away by him, but they were like an endless supply; even if they were dispersed, they would soon reappear in some corner of the village and continue to rush back to join the battle.\nZhou Ze was essentially facing an undead army that could continuously revive!\n\n“Thump!”\n“Thump!”\nThe ancestral hall continuously endured blows,\nThe floor tiles on the ground also began to crack.\nFinally, after Zhou Ze heavily slammed a fierce ghost onto the ground,\nA series of floor tiles beneath his feet completely shattered.\n\nBut beneath the tiles,\nA large area of shimmering white rice appeared.\nZhou Ze was stunned,\nAll the fierce ghosts present were also stunned.\nThe rice must be fake;\nThe village had long been leveled, and even a school had been built on it,\nBut the scene here was real.\n\nThis meant,\nThat when everyone in the village was starving back then,\nBeneath the ancestral hall of this village,\nThere truly was so much grain hidden!\n\nZhou Ze squatted down, reached out and grabbed a handful of rice, and held it up towards the fierce ghosts in front of him,\nAnd said:\n“Eat, you won’t be hungry after eating, and then… you can depart.”\nHowever,\nThe fierce ghosts of the entire village in the ancestral hall didn’t move. They seemed to have no reaction to this rice.\nTheir gaze only lingered on the rice for a moment,\nThen, as if on cue, they all turned their attention to Zhou Ze.\nThey didn’t eat rice,\nBut they were hungry,\nTherefore,\nThey could only eat Zhou Ze!\n\nZhou Ze truly felt like laughing out of extreme anger<sup>10</sup>.\nWhat kind of ghost trick is this<sup>11</sup>?\nAm I really that tasty?\n***\n<sup>1</sup> “接地氣” (jiēdìqì): Literally “connected to the ground air.” An idiom describing something or someone as down-to-earth, unpretentious, realistic, or relatable.\n<sup>2</sup> “欲拒還迎” (yùjùhuányíng): An idiom describing someone who feigns reluctance or plays hard to get, but is actually welcoming or desirous.\n<sup>3</sup> “B格” (B gé): A slang term derived from a component of “裝B” (zhuāng B), meaning “to pretend to be awesome” or “to show off.” “B格” refers to the level of style, class, sophistication, or coolness.\n<sup>4</sup> “是非之地” (shìfēizhīdì): Literally “place of right and wrong.” An idiom for a place prone to disputes, trouble, or scandals; a den of troubles.\n<sup>5</sup> “餓鬼” (èguǐ): In Buddhist cosmology, a hungry ghost is a being consumed by insatiable desires or hunger, often depicted with large, empty bellies and thin necks.\n<sup>6</sup> “煞地” (shàdì): In traditional Chinese geomancy (feng shui), a “煞地” is a geomantically inauspicious or malevolent place, often associated with negative energy, death, or disaster.\n<sup>7</sup> “鬼子” (guǐzi): A derogatory and often xenophobic term for foreigners, particularly used to refer to Japanese soldiers during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n<sup>8</sup> “桃花源” (Táohuā Yuán): The Peach Blossom Spring, a utopian land from a fable by Tao Yuanming, where people live in harmony, ignorant of the outside world.

    "content": "It was a chaotic scene, leaving Zhou Ze somewhat at a loss. The villagers completely ignored the food, instead swarming towards Zhou Ze once again.\n\nZhou Ze's claws tore apart the villagers in front of him again and again, but they would quickly re-form. It was an endless slaughter, a typical case of ants biting an elephant to death.¹\n\nSomething must be sustaining this place, making it function like a barrier cycle, endlessly repeating. These malevolent spirits didn't seem as strong as true malevolent spirits, but their most perverse characteristic was their ability to re-coalesce after death.\n\nThe little monkey clutched Zhou Ze's shoulder, watching Zhou Ze cut his way through. It wanted to help but was completely useless. If it were its old self, cooperating with Zhou Ze, one demon and one underworld enforcer could easily fight their way out. But now, it could only tremble and pray Zhou Ze didn't exhaust himself too quickly.\n\nIt knew that if Zhou Ze was doomed, it would definitely be doomed too.\n\nIt had been eaten by humans in its previous life; was it to be eaten by ghosts again in this one?\n\nIt certainly didn't want that kind of grand slam.²\n\nThe villagers seemed determined to block Zhou Ze's path out of the ancestral hall, fearlessly rushing forward one by one, just to impede Zhou Ze for a few seconds. And they indeed succeeded. Zhou Ze wasn't far from the ancestral hall's entrance; if he could just break out, finding a way to escape would be much simpler. But now, he was trapped in this confined area, feeling very uncomfortable.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak!!!!\"\n\nThe little monkey's tail was grabbed by a villager, and it let out a shriek, feeling like it was about to be eaten.\n\nZhou Ze immediately spun around, his claws bringing forth a black mist that instantly tore apart that villager, pulling the little monkey back. However, doing so put Zhou Ze a bit further away from the entrance again.\n\nThe villagers, with one sustained effort, continuously pressed inward, making Zhou Ze's repeated breakthroughs futile. Now, Zhou Ze was even pushed back to the altar table at the deepest part of the ancestral hall, where the ancestral tablets were placed.\n\n\"Pant... pant... pant...\"\n\nPanting repeatedly, Zhou Ze was indeed a little tired, but the villagers gave him no opportunity to relax.\n\n\"Crash!\"\n\nA crisp sound.\n\nZhou Ze directly swept all the ancestral tablets off the altar table, hoping the villagers would rush to protect their ancestors' tablets, giving him an opening.\n\nBut unfortunately, the villagers felt nothing for the ancestral tablets; they remained indifferent even as the tablets fell to the ground, continuing to charge at Zhou Ze.\n\nFor the first time, Zhou Ze felt a little wronged.\n\nFirst of all, he truly wanted to help people; his conscience was hurting!\n\nYou say you're hungry, and I can see that, but the rice and food are right in front of you. You won't eat them, but you still want to eat me?\n\nThat's unreasonable!\n\nIf you're unreasonable, don't blame me for being unreasonable too!\n\nZhou Ze's anger was ignited. Human kindness and pity had their limits. Zhou Ze charged forward; this time, he didn't actively try to run away, but instead killed every spirit he caught. Simultaneously, as the impatience and rage continuously piled up within him, Zhou Ze's skin slowly began to turn a bronze color.\n\nClearly, the onslaught of fatigue and anger was slowly awakening Zhou Ze's other side.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nTwo spirits were clutched in Zhou Ze's hands and violently slammed onto the ground.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nThe spirits burst apart, God knows where they would re-form and rush back from. At the same time, another pit was smashed into the ground, and white rice grains began to splatter, scattering everywhere.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze stood up, a little bewildered, because all the villagers who had just been screaming in hunger and frantically charging at him had suddenly squatted down and started picking up the rice grains from the ground, not even letting go of the grains in the cracks.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze, who had been the darling of the stage and bathed in the spotlight moments ago,\n\nwas suddenly ignored by everyone.³\n\nThis was truly a huge contrast.\n\nIt left Zhou Ze at a loss as to what to do. One could only say these villagers seemed to be sick, starving like this yet guarding so much food in the ancestral hall without touching it.\n\nWere they all misers?\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze knew this wasn't the time to dwell on it. He immediately rushed out of the ancestral hall with the little monkey. This time, no one stopped him. After running back to the field path, the bronze glow that had just appeared on Zhou Ze's body slowly began to fade.\n\nZhou Ze also let out a long breath. It was better not to enter that state if he could help it. The main thing was that after it ended, not only was his soul in great pain, but the physical paralysis and the prolonged inconvenience it caused in his daily life made Zhou Ze very resistant.\n\nHe grabbed the monkey, which was still clinging to his shoulder and quite shaken, and simply tossed it onto the ground.\n\n\"Find the way out.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to be delayed here until the villagers finished picking up the rice grains and then all came back to besiege him.\n\nThe little monkey didn't disappoint Zhou Ze. After running a short distance and circling a few times, it burrowed directly into a thicket of tall grass and then disappeared.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze wonder if he had raised a monkey or a dog,\n\nbecause the monkey had been sniffing around on the ground with its nose while circling.\n\nZhou Ze also circled a few times, though he didn't imitate it by putting his nose to the ground, and then he rushed into the thicket of tall grass.\n\nHe felt his body lighten,\n\nand Zhou Ze found himself on a street. By then, the shops on the street were mostly closed; it was clearly very late.\n\nThe old priest was squatting nearby, stroking the monkey that had come out earlier. Seeing Zhou Ze emerge, he immediately stood up and asked:\n\n\"Boss, are you alright?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nA Nissan was parked across the street. Xu Qinglang was sitting inside, and when Zhou Ze emerged, he also got out and asked:\n\n\"Is the matter resolved?\"\n\n\"Where were you earlier? I couldn't get through when I called you.\"\n\n\"The signal in the library basement probably isn't good. Let's get in the car first; I've found some other clues.\"\n\nOnce in the car, Zhou Ze briefly recounted what had happened inside.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded and said, \"I first went to the municipal library to look up some information and found a local logbook from the Republic of China era. Well, it wasn't really the Republic of China anymore; at that time, this area was under Japanese occupation.\n\n\"It was a record book, kept by the local puppet government, and it was preserved. It documented the massacre of Sanxiang Village. According to it, it was because local villagers were discovered secretly harboring wounded anti-Japanese resistance fighters, which led to the Japanese devils' retaliatory sweep.\"\n\n\"Get to the point,\" Zhou Ze reminded.\n\n\"Then, I checked the borrowing records for this book. It's a very obscure book, one that ordinary people wouldn't even notice. But in 2009, someone named Li Shi borrowed it. I suspect that this person and the one who posted online are the same.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nNot many people would have really paid attention to the Sanxiang Village incident during that period.\n\n\"I also investigated Li Shi and found that he died of a sudden heart attack at the end of 2009. However, the lead didn't break, because at the time of his heart attack, he was driving, and his car hit a tree.\n\n\"The death location was on a road in a forest in the suburbs.\n\n\"It's a desolate place. It was desolate in 2009, and it's still desolate now. However, there's a sanatorium there, similar to a nursing home but a bit more upscale, operating as a public-private partnership.\"\n\n\"So, you think Li Shi was driving there before he died because he intended to go to the sanatorium?\"\n\n\"Exactly. So I think a clue must be hidden at the sanatorium, and he discovered it. In fact, I think he might have entered Sanxiang Village a second time back then. According to what you said, the villagers inside were starving and had gone mad wanting to eat people, but in 2009, the problem shouldn't have been that severe.\n\n\"Then, he obtained some information in the village. It's just that anyone who can enter Sanxiang Village, apart from a special case like you, is someone who is about to die.\"\n\nAt this point, Xu Qinglang subconsciously looked at the old priest sitting in the back seat.\n\nThe old priest had initially felt quite dejected,\n\nthe monkey had gone in,\n\nthe Boss had gone in,\n\nbut he couldn't get in no matter what, making him feel like a complete failure.\n\nThen, when Xu Qinglang arrived and told him that only people on the verge of death had a chance to enter, the old priest burst into happy laughter, and two snot bubbles appeared at his nose.\n\n\"Li Shi didn't have time to solve that problem; he died midway.\"\n\nZhou Ze watched Xu Qinglang driving and chatting at the same time, asking, \"So, are we going to the sanatorium now?\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n\nHalf an hour later,\n\nthe car drove into the sanatorium. Since it was late at night, the sanatorium was already closed, but Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang, and the others simply climbed over the wall and jumped in. They then entered the office and began accessing the sanatorium's client data.\n\nExtraordinary times naturally called for extraordinary measures. If the problem in Sanxiang Village wasn't resolved soon, and malevolent spirits were truly unleashed, the resulting issues would be terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze, the old priest, and Xu Qinglang searched together. This kind of search was truly like fishing for a needle in the ocean.⁴\n\nBecause no one knew,\n\nwhether the person the original poster was looking for nine years ago,\n\nwas still alive.\n\nAfter all, many people who entered the sanatorium were elderly or in very poor health. Nine years, and they might not have endured it.\n\nMoreover, there was no specific search information; they could only go by intuition.\n\nThis wasn't just fishing for a needle in the ocean anymore; it was like fishing for fish in the ocean.⁵\n\nHowever, one patient's record made Zhou Ze's eyes narrow slightly. He gestured for Xu Qinglang and the old priest to come over, then pointed at the person in the photo and said:\n\n\"Chen Guangnong, born 1919.\"\n\n\"Holy crap, Boss, this guy must be 99 now, right?\" the old priest exclaimed, then puzzled, \"This... it can't be that the person we're looking for is definitely the oldest, can it? I still have a few centenarians here.\"\n\nTongcheng was known as a land of longevity, with its number of centenarians ranking among the highest in cities nationwide.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and said, \"This one's different. I think I've heard of this person. He served as an official in Tongcheng for a period in his early years.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened a web page and began searching. Baidu Baike immediately brought up Chen Guangnong's detailed life history.\n\n\"He defected?\" Xu Qinglang noticed.\n\n\"The records stated that this person was a battalion commander in the Huaihai Campaign during the Chinese Civil War, where he led his troops to defect. He also participated in the Anti-American Aid Korea War, and later returned to his hometown of Tongcheng to serve as a local official for a period before retiring.\"\n\n\"I think it must be this person. Li Shi must have been looking for him,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nA legendary person must have a legendary life to match. This man's life story was already exciting enough.\n\nZhou Ze first found his ward, but what dumbfounded Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang, and the old priest was that Chen Guangnong had already been in a prolonged coma for several years, similar to being in a vegetative state. Now, it was merely that his body hadn't died yet.\n\n\"Fuck, how do we deal with this?\" the old priest asked with a dumbfounded expression.\n\nZhou Ze opened the ward door and walked in. Xu Qinglang motioned for the old priest and the monkey to stand guard outside, then followed him in.\n\nThe ward felt somewhat oppressive. The old man, just one year away from completing his century-long life achievement, was truly at the end of his life.⁶\n\nHe lay there, unconscious,\n\nIf you said he was alive, it was no different from being dead.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the chair beside the bed and glanced at the various instrument readings around the old man. The old man's condition was very grim.\n\n\"Is there a way to wake him up?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nHe knew Zhou Ze used to be a doctor.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. If that person from Rongcheng hadn't been taken away by Tang Shi, it might have been more convenient to invite him. That guy was supposedly a psychologist, and his hypnosis techniques were terrifying; he could even hypnotize and control underworld enforcers.\n\n\"Now, it seems there's only one way left,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What way?\"\n\n\"Kill him now, then capture his spirit and question it.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he was just joking. The man had lived to ninety-nine, which was already quite an achievement. He couldn't just kill him for a few uncertain questions.\n\nMoreover, looking at his current state, after a life full of ups and downs and splendor, lying here for so many years, he might have already come to terms with everything. If he killed him, his soul might go directly to hell, and he wouldn't even be able to ask anything.\n\n\"There's a book in the drawer.\"\n\nXu Qinglang opened the drawer and said.\n\n\"What book?\"\n\n\"An autobiography. It must have been published by his descendants or others, self-published.\"\n\nXu Qinglang took out the book and flipped through it.\n\n\"Look at his early life,\" Zhou Ze reminded.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang found an entry and said, \"Before the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a company commander in the Tongcheng Security Regiment.\"\n\nThe Security Regiment, which was a local armed force, was pretty much as depicted in Anti-Japanese War dramas, with little to no combat effectiveness.\n\n\"When the Japanese devils attacked Tongcheng, did they encounter any resistance?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I checked. The Japanese devils' Iizuka Unit, I think it was the 101st Division, I'm not entirely sure of the specifics. But it's said that Japanese divisions numbered 100 and beyond generally didn't have very high combat effectiveness. This division apparently got beaten quite badly in Jiangxi.\"\n\n\"However, at that time, Tongcheng had no regular Chinese army; it was entirely local armed organizations that resisted the Japanese devils. They fought, but even a rookie division, however green, was far stronger than local armed forces like the Security Regiment, so Tongcheng fell quite quickly.\"\n\n\"So, he participated in Tongcheng's resistance against the Japanese army at that time?\"\n\n\"He should have. He likely didn't become a traitor and surrender; otherwise, he wouldn't have become a battalion commander in the Nationalist Army.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned,\n\nThe sleeping old man covered in age spots before him, and all the villagers of Sanxiang Village, both gave him a feeling of helplessness, like possessing strength but being able to do nothing but punch cotton.⁷\n\nJust now, he and Xu Qinglang had been talking here for so long, yet the old man merely kept his eyes closed without any reaction, clearly having truly lost consciousness of the outside world.\n\nBut leaving just like that, Zhou Ze was somewhat unwilling. So, Zhou Ze bent down, leaned close to the old man's ear, and slowly asked:\n\n\"Old sir, do you still remember... Sanxiang Village?\"\n\nSuddenly,\n\na miracle happened.\n\nThe old man's fingers suddenly began to tremble,\n\nfollowed by his eyelids beginning to twitch continuously.\n\nIt was as if he had heard, or been stimulated. His lips slightly parted, seemingly emitting a very faint sound:\n\n\"Vill...a...gers...\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head; the voice was too faint.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed Zhou Ze aside, put his ear close to the old man's mouth, and listened carefully.\n\nAfter a moment, Xu Qinglang straightened up, his expression serious.\n\n\"What did he say?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He said... wants to kiss you?\"⁸\n\n---\n¹ \"Ants biting an elephant to death\": A Chinese idiom meaning that small forces, if persistent and numerous, can overcome a larger, stronger foe.\n² \"Grand slam\": Here, used sarcastically to mean a complete, unfortunate set of experiences (being eaten by humans in one life, and then by ghosts in the next).\n³ \"Was suddenly ignored by everyone\": Literally, \"no one birded him,\" a colloquial expression meaning \"no one paid him any mind\" or \"no one gave him the time of day.\"\n⁴ \"Fishing for a needle in the ocean\": A Chinese idiom (海底撈針) meaning to search for something with little to no chance of success, similar to \"looking for a needle in a haystack.\"\n⁵ \"Fishing for fish in the ocean\": A variation on the previous idiom. While \"fishing for a needle in the ocean\" implies an almost impossible task, \"fishing for fish in the ocean\" in this context suggests that they were looking for *something* specific (a person), but without any distinguishing characteristics or details, it was still an incredibly difficult and aimless search, even more so than just looking for *any* fish. The humor is that the task became even more vague and hopeless than the already impossible \"needle in a haystack.\"\n⁶ \"At the end of his life\": Literally, \"oil exhausted, lamp dry,\" a Chinese idiom (油盡燈枯) describing one's life force nearing its end, like a lamp running out of oil.\n⁷ \"Punching cotton\": A Chinese expression (拳頭打棉花) meaning to exert effort without any effect or impact, like punching something soft that offers no resistance.\n⁸ \"Wants to kiss you\": In Chinese, `xiang qin ni` (想親你) sounds phonetically similar to `xiang qin men` (鄉親們), which means \"fellow villagers\" or \"my people,\" the phrase the old man was likely attempting to say. This creates a humorous misinterpretation.",

    "content": "\"Boss, is this okay?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist sat in the back, somewhat timidly pointing at the old man lying on his lap and said.\n\nThe old man was still in a semi-conscious state, but he could open his eyes, though only for a moment before closing them again, and his speech was fragmented.\n\nHe was awake,\nHe was indeed awake,\nBut this awakening,\nStrictly speaking, it was actually a final burst of lucidity.\nHe was awake,\nAnd about to depart.\n\nHe had been alive, clinging to a breath. Zhou Ze had previously thought it might be due to his tenacious vitality, or perhaps good medical care combined with some divine favor. But now, it seemed he truly had something he couldn't let go of, something that made him unwilling to close his eyes just yet.\n\nXu Qinglang was driving, fast yet steady. He had to be steady, because a sudden brake or a sharp turn might make the old man in the back simply pass out.\n\nExtracting a patient from a nursing home, especially a dying one who had been in a coma for a long time, was a crazy act. However, Zhou Ze had no regrets and no psychological burden whatsoever.\n\nAlthough the old man hadn't spoken clearly, his attitude had made it evident:\nSanxiang Village,\nHad always been in his heart, never erased.\n\nIn truth, humans are forgetful creatures. People always subconsciously blur out what they don't want to see, erasing memories that cause them pain.\n\nMany people remain undisturbed and indifferent as the elderly women who were comfort women pass away one by one, unaware that each of their departures is akin to that period of history slowly being sealed away from us.\n\nSome things, in fact, must not be forgotten.\n\nUpon reaching the streets of Xingren Town, Xu Qinglang got out of the car, then helped the Old Taoist carry the old man out.\n\n\"Old brother, just hold on a little longer, we're almost there, almost there!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist encouraged this 99-year-old elder.\n\nXu Qinglang felt the old man's hand on his shoulder, pressing slightly.\n\nThe old man's half-open eyes looked towards Zhou Ze. His eyes were very cloudy, as if covered by a layer of gauze. His body was long exhausted; he needed to go and rest, he deserved to rest.\n\n\"The villagers are all there,\" Zhou Ze said seriously. \"I don't know what they are waiting for, but since you woke up upon hearing me say 'Sanxiang Village,' it means I found the right person, and you are concerned about them too.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\nZhou Ze reached out, tidied the old man's sparse hair, and then helped fasten the buttons on the old man's hospital gown.\n\nThe old man was already in his final burst of lucidity.\n\nHis merits and demerits would be judged by later generations.\nIt was difficult for modern people to empathize with or evaluate the turmoil of those years.\n\nAt the very least, one thing could be proven: when the old man served in the Tongcheng Peace Preservation Corps, he did not desert, nor did he become a traitor. When a division of Japanese troops landed in a harbor near Tongcheng, there were no regular Chinese forces in Tongcheng.\n\nHowever, relying solely on the local armed Peace Preservation Corps and the spontaneous resistance of the residents, the Japanese army suffered considerable losses. Furthermore, the local armed forces had planned counterattacks on Tongcheng's city gates more than once. While the main forces and the strategic focus were shifting southwest,\n\nIn this isolated Japanese-occupied area, there were still people resisting, and gunshots still rang out.\n\nThe old man was still looking at Zhou Ze. As he watched, he began to cough. His teeth were almost all gone, and he coughed feebly, but he was smiling.\n\nThen,\nHe struggled to reach out, seemingly wanting to touch Zhou Ze.\n\nThe Old Taoist watched beside him with a pang of anxiety, thinking, *Old brother, just be steady. Don't exhaust yourself to death out here before we even get in.*\n\nZhou Ze stood still,\nAllowing the old man's withered, skeletal hand to lightly grip the clothing over his chest.\n\nThe old man's grip was very weak.\nThen, Zhou Ze felt two light presses on his chest.\n\nThat place,\nWas where the heart lay.\n\nAfter completing this action, the old man slumped, as if all his strength had been drained, and his breathing began to become erratic.\n\n\"Go in, hurry.\"\n\nHaving said that, Zhou Ze began circling in that spot, then rushed onto the road, whereupon he disappeared entirely.\n\nXu Qinglang took out a talisman and pasted it on his forehead. Instantly, his forehead began to darken. Then, mimicking Zhou Ze, he also circled a few times in that spot and rushed over.\n\nThe Old Taoist also followed, circling a few times, then rushed forward.\nHeh,\nDidn't go in.\nHehehe.\n\nThe Old Taoist's entire face wrinkled into a chrysanthemum as he laughed, truly overjoyed.\n\nThe little monkey watched the Old Taoist's silly antics, slightly turning sideways, indicating it didn't know this old rascal.\n\nUpon re-entering Sanxiang Village, Zhou Ze looked up and saw that the moon in the sky had almost turned blood-red. It hadn't been like this when he entered half a day ago.\n\nFrom the looks of it, his rampant killing spree in the ancestral hall might have intensified something, making the situation here implicitly more urgent.\n\nTherefore, if the old man Xu Qinglang was carrying couldn't resolve the situation here and break the deadlock, then Zhou Ze, as a ghost messenger, would probably have to call the little girl to guard the exit with him.\n\nWhether they would successfully guard the pass and prevent these malevolent ghosts from spilling into the human world,\nWas hard to say.\n\nXu Qinglang entered, carrying the old man on his back. As soon as he entered, Xu Qinglang felt the person on his back grow heavy. Xu Qinglang's eyes widened immediately, somewhat disbelieving:\n\nNo way,\nDead?\nGrandpa, don't scare me, you haven't even lived to be a hundred yet!\n\nXu Qinglang anxiously wanted to turn his head to check on the old man on his back, but then he suddenly saw Zhou Ze looking calmly behind him.\n\n\"Put him down,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang slowly lowered the old man's remains from his back. Turning around, he saw a young man standing behind him.\n\nThe young man was wearing a black military uniform, with a rifle slung over his back, and a cap on his head.\n\nIt was a very typical Peace Preservation Corps uniform, some parts even patched, appearing a bit worn. This attire was common in recently popular anti-Japanese war films.\n\nHe had died.\nWas this his soul?\n\nThe old man,\nOh no,\nThe young man looked at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, nodded slightly, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. It seemed like he was reminiscing, or perhaps mourning.\n\nAt the corners of his eyes, two lines of tears dripped down.\n\nHe had died,\nBut the tears weren't shed because of his death.\n\nIn fact, for him, death was more of a liberation. He had been lying in bed for too long, and before he fell into a coma and lost consciousness, he had actually held on for far too long.\n\nHe didn't know what he had been holding on for. His comrades who had emerged from the years of war and chaos had left one by one, until in the end, he was left all alone.\n\nHe was almost a hundred years old, but he hadn't lived to be a hundred just for the sake of it. He had people he cared about, promises he remembered, and...\nDebts of gratitude.\n\nWhat the old man didn't know was that nine years ago, when he hadn't yet fallen into a coma, a person named Li Shi had planned to drive to the nursing home to find him. He could have arrived here nine years earlier.\n\nBut the forum poster, in the end, couldn't defy his own fate. The fact that he could enter Sanxiang Village meant his life was already short.\n\nLi Shi, ultimately, couldn't outrun his destiny.\n\nPerhaps, nine years ago, the villagers of this village hadn't yet gone mad to this extent. There were still people... who could talk, who could communicate.\n\nThey told Li Shi some things, and Li Shi also intended to go out and help them find the person they had been waiting for.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze saw the old man and the little girl walking towards the village entrance again.\n\nThe old man and the young girl's walking postures were somewhat stiff. The little girl was clutching her sugar figurine, tugging at it continuously, while the old man carried a hoe, his face pale green.\n\nAt the corners of their eyes, faint red glints flickered, and drool continuously trickled from their mouths.\n\nIt's getting more serious,\nHere.\n\nThe young man walked forward, following the field ridge onto the road.\n\nHe showed no fear, for he had no reason to be afraid.\n\nThe debt of gratitude that had remained in his heart for nearly eighty years,\nToday,\nWas his liberation.\n\nThe young man was already an old man nearing a hundred, but at this moment, he still took off his cap, waved it vigorously, and shouted:\n\n\"Grandpa Xu, Ah Hua!\"\n\nJust like eighty years ago!\n\nThe old man heard the voice and froze for a moment.\nThe little girl also suddenly paused.\n\nThe old man and the young girl,\nFroze completely.\n\nXu Qinglang stood beside Zhou Ze, hands on his hips, somewhat worried. \"Nothing bad will happen, right?\"\n\n\"We can only try,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nA moment later,\nThe crimson color in the old man's eyes began to recede, and he exclaimed, \"Xi Na Kang Zi (young man), Little Chen, hey, you're back!\"\n\nThe little girl's expression also transformed from sinister to innocent and joyful, and she ran happily towards the young man: \"Uncle Chen, you're back!\"\n\nThe old man and the young girl both ran to the young man's side, overjoyed.\n\nThe young man turned his head, glanced at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang standing in the distance, then nodded heavily at the old man and little girl in front of him, saying:\n\n\"Yes, I'm back, I'm back!\"\n\n\"Where are the troops? Have the troops returned? Yesterday I heard that the Japanese devils were still killing people in the city, and bodies were hanging on the city walls.\"\n\n\"The troops, the troops are back too!\" the young man shouted forcefully. \"We're going to fight the Japs!\"\n\n\"Good!\" The old man waved a fist, then said, \"Come, before you left, you told us to help collect grain for the main army to eat when they fought back. Our village's grain is all collected and hidden underground in the ancestral hall. The Japs came a while ago, but they didn't find any.\"\n\n\"Then do you all have food at home?\" the young man asked worriedly.\n\n\"Hey, it was all voluntary, everyone. We just eat some wild vegetables to fill our bellies. Starving for a while won't kill anyone. Of course we're hungry, but it's nothing.\"\n\nThe old man pulled the young man's hand and walked into the village, while the young man picked up the little girl, who was very happy.\n\nZhou Ze, in the distance, heard this conversation,\nAnd was somewhat moved.\n\nThe old man said starving for a few days was fine,\nBut they had been starving for eighty years.\n\nStarving for a while, for a person, is indeed fine;\nBut a continuous eighty years of hunger—that's enough to make even ghosts unable to bear it. This is an unimaginable torture!\n\n\"Little Chen is back, the main army is coming back to fight!\"\n\nAs soon as they entered the village, the old man shouted.\n\nThe entire Sanxiang Village instantly erupted.\n\nThe old woman sitting at her doorstep, who had been drooling while sewing shoe soles, gave a jolt, stood up, and shouted:\n\n\"Little Chen's back!\"\n\nThe widow at the well, who had been drawing water while chewing her own hair, immediately spat out the hair from her mouth.\n\nHer face radiant with charm,\nRevealing a touch of her unique allure, swaying her waist, she shouted:\n\n\"Little Chen, if you don't come back soon, this granny's chest will shrink from hunger! If I can't find a man then, you'll have to take me, this granny!\"\n\nInside the tiled house, the man boiling water immediately dropped the firewood in his hand, grabbed his wife's hand, and rushed out of the house with her.\n\nVillagers gathered from all directions,\nAll together, they flocked around the young man and walked towards the ancestral hall.\n\nThe blind old man sitting at the ancestral hall's entrance shakily stood up. He had heard the voices, and the commotion. Little Chen, who had recovered from his injuries in the village before, was back.\n\nHe had said the main army would return to fight soon,\nHe had said the Japanese devils wouldn't last much longer.\nHe had asked everyone to help prepare grain for when the main army returned.\n\nThe blind old man dropped his cane and knelt on the ancestral hall floor, fumbling with his hands among the floor tiles. Then, he lifted several bricks.\n\nHe reached his hand beneath the tiles. As the crowd surged to the ancestral hall entrance,\nThe blind old man held up a handful of gleaming white rice,\nAnd shouted:\n\n\"Little Chen, the grain!\nThe grain the villagers prepared for the main army,\nWe kept it hidden,\nThe Japs didn't find it.\nIt's saved for the main army!\nYou eat your fill, so you can fight the Japs well!\"\n\nThe young man stood at the ancestral hall entrance, watching the grains of rice continuously slip through the blind old man's fingers.\n\nSlowly, he raised his head.\nHe cried.\n\nBack then, he was full of confidence, telling the villagers while recovering from his injuries that the main army would return soon.\n\nThe villagers believed him.\nBut in reality,\nThe main army returned almost seven years later. The villagers didn't live to see those seven years. In fact, less than a week after he had recovered from his injuries and left to find the main army, the news of this village sheltering wounded soldiers was leaked.\n\nThe Japanese army and puppet forces rushed here, massacring everyone in the village, young and old, as a warning to others.\n\nThis was also why he didn't want to fight in the civil war and eventually defected.\nSome people,\nWere still waiting for him,\nWaiting for him to return.\nThe Japanese had been driven away, and he should have gone back.\n\n\"Really... can there be such deep obsession?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned.\n\n\"There must be external factors influencing it.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw the blood moon in the sky slowly becoming clearer, and the malevolent energy in the village was gradually dissipating.\n\nAt the same time, something crystalline fell from the sky, landing in a pile of thatch ahead.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, searched, and found a bronze ring in the pile of thatch. Its patterns were eerie, and it felt heavy in his hand.\n\nWhat he had just said was left unfinished.\nZhou Ze, having picked up the ring, continued:\n\n\"But external things are external things after all. Some obsessions are ingrained to the bone, and external forces cannot stop them.\nOtherwise,\nEighty years ago, our nation would have already perished.\"",

    "content": "If one looked closely at the ring, there were some cracks, giving it a sense of imperfection, involuntarily stirring a strong feeling of regret.\n\nZhou Ze didn't hastily put the ring directly on his hand; instead, he put it in his pocket.\n\nThis ring was extraordinary. The fact that Three Villages could be sustained in this way for eighty years must be inextricably linked to this ring. Zhou Ze was afraid of an accident if he rashly put it on his finger.\n\nMoreover, now was not the time to study the ring. There was still one thing left undone, one that was the most fundamental and most important.\n\nZhou Ze actively walked towards the ancestral hall. Looking at the boisterous crowd there, his gaze met that of the young man for a few seconds, and the young man nodded slightly.\n\nA silent understanding formed between them.\n\nThe young man lived to be ninety-nine, having experienced wars and various turbulent times. Such a life was one in ten thousand, and the wisdom brought by such life experiences was hard to imitate or surpass.\n\nMany things didn't need to be said, but both understood.\n\nZhou Ze crossed his hands, slowly spreading them apart.\n\nThe Gate of Hell was slowly opening.\n\nThis was the end.\n\nThis was the destination of the deceased.\n\nIt was the inevitable path for all beings!\n\n“Folks, let’s go!”\n\nThe young man led the villagers towards Zhou Ze.\n\nEighty years of trials and tribulations,\n\nThey had endured hardship,\n\nThey had suffered difficulty.\n\nAt this moment, the young man felt it was time to close his eyes, taking the villagers with him to close their eyes.\n\nThe young man was very satisfied with this kind of ending. It was the end he had always awaited, the end he had hoped for.\n\nIn the past, his fellow villagers had died because of his implication. After he learned the news, he knelt for a whole night in front of the old scholar tree outside the military camp.\n\nThen, for seven years, he fought in bloody battles again and again, thinking of giving his life on the battlefield fighting the devils, to exchange for a clear conscience towards his fellow villagers!\n\nBut on the battlefield, the less afraid of death he was, the less likely he was to die. He survived battle after battle and even received promotions.\n\nWhen the devils surrendered, he also grew weary, feeling his mission was complete and it was time to end. Because of this, he detested civil war. In his view, the outbreak of civil war was a complete blasphemy against the villagers of Three Villages and the heroes who died one by one on the anti-Japanese battlefield!\n\nThe devils had been driven out, World War II had ended, but on the land of Eastern China at that time, a million-strong melee was still taking place.\n\nSo he revolted.\n\nHe hoped this chaotic situation could end soon.\n\nFrom youth to old age, his life had passed through one turning point after another, but not until today, until this very moment, did the young man feel that his life was complete.\n\nThe half-missing period was finally rounded out.\n\nThe young man was the first to walk into the Gate of Hell.\n\nThe villagers behind followed one after another.\n\nNo one resisted.\n\nNo one cried or fussed.\n\nEveryone had a smile on their faces.\n\nDeep within their smiles, there was also a sense of liberation.\n\nThey were tired, everyone was tired.\n\nSome things were fake, but how could people living within fake things not notice at all?\n\nThis was a dream, a dream everyone was holding onto.\n\nAnd now, the dream had ended, but the outcome was beautiful.\n\nTherefore, there was naturally no unwillingness, nor any resentment.\n\nOnly a sense of detachment and clear conscience.\n\nXu Qinglang stood by the side, silently counting heads.\n\nThe last one was the little girl holding a sugar figurine. The little girl looked at Zhou Ze, smiled, her eyes crinkling into adorable crescent moons, then bounced into the Gate of Hell.\n\nZhou Ze let go of his hands.\n\nThe Gate of Hell dissipated.\n\n“Farewell.”\n\nZhou Ze said slowly.\n\nXu Qinglang slightly lowered his head and bowed:\n\n“Farewell.”\n\nTo be honest, maintaining the Gate of Hell was also a very tiring task, and he had kept it open for so long.\n\nBut Boss Zhou had never felt so good.\n\nAlright,\n\nit was indeed inappropriate to talk about performance in front of the villagers,\n\nespecially in this atmosphere,\n\nhe should cry.\n\nEveryone, cry your hearts out!\n\nBut the exhilarating feeling of performance constantly increasing still stimulated Boss Zhou's nerves.\n\nHe tried hard.\n\nHe tried very hard.\n\nHe couldn't cry.\n\nHe really couldn't cry.\n\nNot laughing was already extremely difficult.\n\nXu Qinglang watched from the side, a little speechless. “Just laugh if you want to. You already have a problem; suppressing it will only make it worse.”\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, looked at Xu Qinglang, and said, “Let’s erect a monument for them, like a memorial.”\n\n“I have no problem, you decide.”\n\n“But I don’t have money. I still owe you and my Yingying money.”\n\n“…………” Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang suddenly had an ominous premonition.\n\nNo,\n\ncan't,\n\nRefuse!\n\n“As someone with over twenty apartments, taking one to sell and build a memorial, that’s reasonable, right?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“…………” Xu Qinglang.\n\n“You have to consider, without the contributions and sacrifices of these people eighty years ago, you wouldn't be living in a peaceful and prosperous era, nor would housing prices be this high.\n\nRight?”\n\n“…………” Xu Qinglang.\n\n“So, you’re willing, aren’t you?”\n\n“Why do I feel like you’re morally blackmailing me?” Xu Qinglang said, very displeased.\n\n“It’s up to your mood, actually. Underworld money is something tangible, but some things are intangible.” Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang’s shoulder.\n\n“This, let’s talk about it when we get back.”\n\nZhou Ze didn't continue the topic, instead instinctively took out his credential booklet.\n\nSo many villagers,\n\nthe performance should be enough, right?\n\nHis 'temporary' badge should be able to be removed, and he could become a regular employee, right?\n\nHowever,\n\nopening the credential booklet, he saw:\n\nZhou Ze froze.\n\nPerformance: Ninety-nine percent.\n\nThis meant: “I just rubbed against the outside, I didn’t go in!”¹\n\nIt had kept its promise, truly not going in.\n\nIf it had gone in, it would be a beast.\n\nBut not going in, it was worse than a beast!\n\n“How much is it?” Xu Qinglang leaned over, ready to look too. “If you become a regular employee, should we get some underworld money as a bonus?”\n\nWhen Xu Qinglang saw ninety-nine percent, he chuckled dishonestly.\n\nHe laughed exaggeratedly,\n\nvery freely.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, looking at Xu Niang-niang² laughing so guilelessly, and said:\n\n“Old Xu, let’s discuss something.”\n\n“Speak.”\n\n“Help if you can?”\n\n“Mm, help if I can.”\n\n“You’re a Xuan Xiu. The probability of turning into a ghost after death is much higher for you than for ordinary people, right? How about this: let me kill you, collect your soul, and round up my percentage? Can you do that?”\n\n“…………” Xu Qinglang.\n\nShaking his head, Zhou Ze smiled and said, “Don’t be nervous, it’s fine. Isn’t there still a little girl in the bookstore?”\n\nSending that girl off would make it complete, truly complete.\n\nThis time, there was no crawling into haystacks. After the ring fell and was taken by Zhou Ze, and the villagers entered the Gate of Hell one by one, the environment here slowly faded.\n\nFinally,\n\nit merged and overlapped with reality.\n\nXu Qinglang and Zhou Ze stood on the road, while Old Taoist and Monkey were opposite them.\n\nGetting into the car, Xu Qinglang was still driving. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat, constantly fiddling with the credential booklet in his hand.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze now felt like when his elementary school teacher appointed him as a group leader.\n\nVery childish,\n\nbut also a little excited.\n\n“Heh heh.” Xu Qinglang chuckled twice. “You’re already this happy now. When you get promoted to open a yamen on Mount Tai, won’t you just die of happiness?”\n\n“If that day truly comes, after you die, I will help you.”\n\n“At least you have some conscience.” Xu Qinglang felt greatly comforted.\n\n“I’ll help you for sure reincarnate as a woman in your next life, completely relieving your pain and discomfort.”\n\n“Kacha…………”\n\nWith a sudden brake, everyone in the car jolted.\n\nXu Qinglang took several deep breaths, suppressing the urge to strangle Zhou Ze.\n\nDamn it,\n\nhe was truly scared.\n\nBecause theoretically,\n\nZhou Ze *could* possibly achieve this!\n\n“Is there any benefit to getting rid of the temporary worker badge?” Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n“Will your power greatly increase? Get an extra magic artifact? Or add some more special effects for you?” Xu Qinglang pressed.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. “I asked the little loli. She said that after becoming a regular employee, every time someone is sent to hell, a judgment verse will automatically appear in the booklet.”\n\n“Judgment verse?”\n\n“Similar to the judgment verses in *Dream of the Red Chamber*.”\n\n“What’s the use of that?” Xu Qinglang asked, puzzled.\n\n“To increase B-ge³.”\n\n“Hm?”\n\n“Meaning, it’s more prestigious.”\n\nAfter speaking,\n\nZhou Ze raised his head and looked out the window,\n\ngazing at the sky.\n\n…………\n\nWhen the car arrived at the bookstore entrance, Zhou Ze got out first. Ninety-nine was just one short, and that one was inside.\n\nPreviously, fearing other accidents, he had made a contingency plan: Zhou Ze didn't send the little girl to hell first, but instead had Bai Yingying watch her.\n\nSo, after pushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze directly called out:\n\n“Yingying?”\n\n“Yingyingyingying⁴…………”\n\nThe sound came from behind the counter.\n\n“Hello?” Zhou Ze called out again.\n\n“Yingyingyingying…………”\n\n“What are you doing? Stop messing around and bring that girl’s soul over here.”\n\n“Yingyingyingying…………”\n\nZhou Ze realized something was wrong, immediately went around the counter, and found Bai Yingying sitting there with her hands and feet bound by a black rope. At the same time, her mouth was also gagged by a rope.\n\nShe could only make 'yingyingyingying' sounds.\n\nZhou Ze immediately went over to help Bai Yingying untie the ropes, but as soon as his fingers touched the black rope, a sharp pain shot through them, and Bai Yingying trembled uncontrollably from the pain.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze let his fingernails grow out and used them to tear the rope. The broken rope immediately turned into ordinary grass rope and drifted away.\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“Boss! Yingyingying…………”\n\nBai Yingying directly threw herself into Zhou Ze’s arms, hugging his neck and sobbing, as if she had suffered an immense grievance.\n\n“What exactly happened?” Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n“That little girl… little girl… I couldn’t beat her. Yingying is useless, I’ve embarrassed you, Boss.”\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Bai Yingying’s back, his expression turning a little grim. He asked again:\n\n“That little girl?”\n\n“Yes, she wanted to leave, and I stopped her. Then she just tied me up.”\n\n“Where is she?”\n\n“Gone.”\n\n“Gone?”\n\n“Oh, she also left some writing, I think it’s on the counter.”\n\nXu Qinglang walked over at this moment, having heard the whole story. He immediately rummaged on the counter, found a piece of paper, the strokes were very firm, and he directly read aloud:\n\n“When I was young, I was afraid of ghosts, thinking they were hideous and terrifying.\nWhen I grew up, I became afraid of people, even if they were impeccably dressed.\nThat’s really well-written,” Xu Qinglang said.\n\n“That’s what *I* wrote,” Zhou Ze said. As he spoke, Zhou Ze also walked over, pushed aside the papers and books on the counter, and continued searching.\n\n“You wrote that? Then where’s what she wrote? It should have even more B-ge, right?” Xu Qinglang asked curiously.\n\nThen,\n\nXu Qinglang froze.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze pushed aside the clutter on the counter,\n\non the counter table, there was a line of crooked, childish-looking writing:\n\n“Braised pork, it’s really delicious!”\n\n---\n¹ Literally, “I just rubbed against the outside, I didn’t go in!” This is a common euphemism in Chinese, implying sexual contact without penetration. Here, it humorously refers to the frustration of being 99% complete but not fully achieving the goal.\n² “Niang-niang” (娘娘) is an honorific title for an empress or imperial consort. Here, it is used playfully and sarcastically by Zhou Ze towards Xu Qinglang, implying a pampered, delicate, or somewhat feminine demeanor.\n³ “B-ge” (逼格) is Chinese internet slang for \"gravitas,\" \"class,\" \"coolness,\" \"swag,\" or \"prestige.\" It implies a high level of sophistication or an impressive aura.\n⁴ “Yingyingyingying” (嚶嚶嚶嚶) is a Chinese onomatopoeia for a soft, high-pitched whimpering or crying sound, often associated with a delicate or aggrieved manner.",

    "content": "Two more days passed. These two days were strangely quiet; not a single ghost came calling. Boss Zhou sat in the bookstore every night,\n\nwaiting,\n\nwaiting,\n\nwaiting until he nearly pined away, yet still nothing.\n\nThis was too much for Bai Yingying to bear. With Boss's usually lazy disposition, it was rare for him to pour himself wholeheartedly into the fervor of work, but still, no customers arrived.\n\nAs for the little girl who had tied up Bai Yingying, she hadn't reappeared, and her identity remained a mystery.\n\nShe might be an anomaly within that village,\n\nbut it was also possible she wasn't from the village at all.\n\nHer appearance might have just been to act as a go-between and guide him to pay attention to Sanxiang Village, using his hand to deal with the village.\n\nZhou Ze had speculated about her identity, even wondering if she might have a higher status than a Ghost Catcher?\n\nLike a Chief Constable?\n\nOr even... a Judge?\n\nIt was just that Zhong Kui's image was too deeply ingrained. If the Judge was that little girl, Zhou Ze felt somewhat concerned about Hell's aesthetic and atmosphere.\n\nA little loli was one thing, but if a Judge was also a delicate little girl, were the Ten Kings of Hell all big-dicked cute girls?^1\n\nOf course, this was just a joke; it was probably impossible.\n\nThe little loli was still tracking down the priest's whereabouts. She sent a message once, midway, saying she was close to finding him. So, Zhou Ze didn't make her look for that little girl again. A being capable of flipping over Bai Yingying, a two-hundred-year-old female corpse, and playing bondage with her—as long as she held no ill will, there was no need to provoke her again.\n\nBesides, the other party hadn't played any negative role in the entire affair.\n\nBut when would he find the next ghost?\n\nJust one more was needed!\n\n\"Come back quickly!\n\nI can't wait anymore!\n\nCome back quickly...\"\n\nThe bookstore's speakers began playing this song. Zhou Ze coughed, looked at Monkey beside him, and Monkey silently changed the song.\n\nThe Old Daoist sat opposite, cracking melon seeds and watching TV, quite leisurely, as there weren't many customers. Recent international news was rather rich, with one event after another, keeping people engrossed.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, poured himself a glass of water, and as he passed the Old Daoist, the Old Daoist suddenly spoke:\n\n\"Boss, is there a TV station in Hell?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"There should be, right?\" the Old Daoist guessed.\n\n\"Heh.\" Xu Qinglang, who was mixing new-flavored cocktails in the distance, let out a laugh.\n\n\"What's so funny? You've never died, so you have no right to speak,\" the Old Daoist retorted stubbornly.\n\n\"Then tell me, if there were TV programs in Hell, what would they show?\" Xu Qinglang teased the Old Daoist.\n\n\"Hmph hmph.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist instinctively cleared his throat, then said:\n\n\"Now broadcasting the Underworld News Broadcast. Here are the headlines:\n\nKing Yama, representative of the Eastern Underworld, met with Hades, Lord of Western Hell.\n\nBoth parties held friendly consultations on issues concerning the passage of deceased souls between East and West.\n\nUnderworld Judge Zhong Kui inspected land registration work in the Underworld, resolutely combating the phenomenon of evil spirits illegally occupying land.\"\n\nZhou Ze listened, shook his head, and walked back to his original seat.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned for a moment; he was truly impressed by the Old Daoist's glibness.\n\nJust then, it started raining outside, and the rain grew heavier and heavier.\n\nZhou Ze didn't pay it any mind at first, but gradually his expression grew serious. Deep within the curtain of rain, a woman in a qipao stood, holding a red paper umbrella.\n\nHer red umbrella covered her head, but from that angle, she was actually looking at him.\n\nHowever, this time, not only did the Old Daoist not notice anything, but even Xu Qinglang had no feeling whatsoever.\n\nThe qipao woman didn't move her feet,\n\nbut her entire body drew closer to Zhou Ze in segments,\n\nand after a few moments, she was directly outside the glass window next to Zhou Ze's seat.\n\nA graceful figure, beautiful features, the most exquisite skin in the world, but inside, it was a nest of scorpions and maggots.\n\nZhou Ze had seen this group of qipao women, who walked with umbrellas and sang on the Yellow Springs Road, more than once. But this time, the other party had appeared in the Mortal Realm.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the bookstore. The qipao woman turned around and began to move away again. Amidst the curtain of rain, her figure appeared so hazy.\n\nIf it were an ordinary person, they might develop a fascination and desire for her. In the rain, such a woman could often make you ignore fear and strangeness, and instead, prostrate yourself completely at her feet.\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nZhou Ze called out,\n\nbut the other party kept walking. Her arrival seemed to be only to attract Zhou Ze's attention and then lead him to another place. She was likely a messenger.\n\nFor a qipao woman, capable of walking back and forth on the Yellow Springs Road, to act as a messenger, the person behind her must certainly be extraordinary.\n\nHowever, seeing that the qipao woman had already widened the distance between them, Zhou Ze simply turned around and went back into the bookstore.\n\nWhat a joke,\n\nYou come in coolly, without a word,\n\nand then you coolly walk away? Am I supposed to chase after you endlessly, like the male lead in a melodramatic play, running and shouting?\n\nThis isn't Hell; this is the Mortal Realm.\n\nThis bad habit,\n\nis truly spoiled.\n\nClosing the bookstore door, Zhou Ze stretched, sat back down in his spot, and asked Bai Yingying to pour him a cup of coffee.\n\nWhat he didn't know was that at the very moment he turned to re-enter the bookstore,\n\nthe ethereal qipao woman in the distance stepped into a puddle with a *squish*,\n\nShe turned her head,\n\nrevealing her face, which was a wild carnival of maggots,\n\nsomewhat incredulous!\n\nHe,\n\nactually just went back like that?\n\nAfterward, she seemed to hesitate, wondering if she needed to walk the path again?\n\nWith the same previous posture, the same previous demeanor?\n\n\"Squish.\"\n\nA pair of black rain boots stepped into the puddle. A man with entirely white hair reached out and flicked water droplets from his hat brim. His slightly pale hand rested on the qipao woman.\n\nThe qipao woman immediately began to wither, turning into a paper figure that slowly got soaked in the rain until, finally, it completely disintegrated in the puddle.\n\n\"Forget it. Since I can't invite him over, I'll go pay him a visit myself.\"\n\nThe man wore a coffee-colored overcoat with a distinctly British style, but his head of white hair made his demeanor seem a bit out of place.\n\nAt his age, with that hair,\n\nhe was the spitting image of a 'Shamat' popular ten years ago.^2\n\nBut the man still went his own way, walking slowly. Finally, he reached the bookstore entrance and pushed open the door.\n\nWhat met his eyes was a woman mixing drinks at the bar,\n\noh no,\n\non closer inspection,\n\nthere was an Adam's apple,\n\nit was a man?\n\nThe white-haired man couldn't help but take another look at Xu Qinglang.\n\nInteresting,\n\na man more beautiful than a woman working as a bartender here.\n\nLooking further, Bai Yingying appeared in the white-haired man's line of sight. She walked over, carrying coffee, petite and demurely leaning on him.\n\nA zombie?\n\nKept in the store?\n\nThe man pondered silently. He was here, but no one in the store could see him, including Zhou Ze, who sat there, having taken his coffee, preparing to read the newspaper.\n\nPeople inherently maintain a primal fear of one thing:\n\nthings they cannot see.\n\nAnd while Zhou Ze had been able to see the umbrella-wielding woman earlier, he couldn't see the person standing at his bookstore's entrance right now, a person even he couldn't perceive.\n\nA little monkey ran past the white-haired man with its toy hammer. Naturally agile, it didn't notice anything amiss, completely oblivious to the presence of a person right beside it, who was looking down at it.\n\nBut in the white-haired man's eyes, this monkey was emitting a strong aura of malevolence.\n\nOriginally a spirit monkey, it had cultivated the feel of a vengeful ghost, but these things were suppressed and simply couldn't manifest.\n\n\"Achoo!\"\n\nThe Old Daoist let out a loud sneeze.\n\nThe white-haired man looked at the Old Daoist,\n\nand then,\n\nhis gaze fell directly on the Old Daoist's crotch area. There, a bright yellow light talisman glowed, completely enveloping the two walnuts beneath the Old Daoist.\n\nThe white-haired man closed his eyes. He found it somewhat an eyesore.\n\nThis store,\n\nis truly interesting.\n\nA small Ghost Catcher, yet he has arranged his residence so richly, stuffing it with so many strange people and things.\n\nFinally, the white-haired man looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nand walked up to him.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, his hand suddenly trembled, and some coffee spilled onto his cuff.\n\nBai Yingying, quick-witted, hurried over to help wipe it, and at the same time, helped Zhou Ze take off his stained jacket to get him a clean one to change into.\n\nWhen the Boss wanted to be particular, he was truly very particular,\n\nbut fortunately, Comrade Yingying was already used to it.\n\nThe white-haired man sat down in front of Zhou Ze; the two were, in fact, sitting face to face.\n\n\"A temporary Ghost Catcher, then?\"\n\nThe white-haired man murmured,\n\n\"Tongcheng, this small place, Ghost Catchers are replaced so quickly.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around somewhat puzzled, always feeling that something was amiss. Had that umbrella-wielding, cool-looking qipao woman just left like that?\n\nShe left,\n\nand there was nothing else?\n\nWhat Zhou Ze didn't know was that the 'nothing else' was sitting right in front of him.\n\nA brush appeared in the white-haired man's hand, which he lightly twirled between his fingers.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent done. Just a little more to gain full status.\"\n\nThe white-haired man smiled,\n\n\"Then I'll do you a favor and help you with that last bit, so you can gain full status.\n\nBut since this is official business,\n\nyou must kneel before me,\n\nand pay your respects to this humble one.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a sour ache in his knees, and this sensation was intensifying. Everything was happening inexplicably.\n\nThe white-haired man sat calmly, holding his brush. Seeing Zhou Ze merely stand up and thump his legs, he was somewhat surprised. Why was Zhou Ze's reaction so slow?\n\nAn ordinary Ghost Catcher, after being stimulated by a wisp of his leaked aura, should immediately prostrate themselves tremblingly.\n\nAre you, compared to others,\n\nany different?\n\nThe white-haired man frowned slightly, and at the same time, softly said:\n\n\"Kneel.\"\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply,\n\nhis body stiffened instantly, as if someone who had been lying in a warm bed was suddenly stripped naked and sent into a world of ice and snow.\n\n\"Boss, your ID, you forgot to take your ID out of your dirty clothes.\"\n\nBai Yingying walked over with Zhou Ze's ID and handed it to him.\n\nThe ID was back in Zhou Ze's hand,\n\nand the white-haired man, who had previously worn an indifferent expression, suddenly opened his mouth.\n\nBehind Zhou Ze,\n\nhe saw a great mountain, and beneath the mountain, faintly, the figure of a monkey;\n\nMonkey moving mountains, Mountain-moving Ape,\n\nwhose body was ten thousand zhang tall,\n\nbearing only Mount Tai!\n\nWith a crisp *thud*,\n\nthe white-haired man was so scared that he immediately knelt down,\n\nhis face full of disbelief as he said:\n\n\"Lord... Prefect?\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, the white-haired man's already invisible form completely disintegrated, vanishing into thin air.\n\n..............\n\nIn a pitch-black place,\n\nthe white-haired youth, who had been dozing against an old scholar tree, suddenly opened his eyes.\n\nHe looked as if he had just had a dream, dripping with cold sweat. Behind the youth, a giant brush was strapped to his back, making him seem a bit out of place.\n\nThe youth looked disheartened.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nbelow,\n\nbeneath the old scholar tree,\n\na pair of blood-red eyes, as large as two houses, appeared, like two enormous lanterns hanging in the sky.\n\nThe old scholar tree grew on its body.\n\nIt had horns like a deer, a head like a camel, a mouth like a donkey, eyes like a turtle, ears like an ox, scales like a fish, whiskers like a shrimp, a belly like a snake, and feet like an eagle—a veritable Nine-Unlikes, even more exaggerated and bizarre than the so-called Four-Unlikes.\n\n\"Didn't I allow you... to wander in spirit... for three months...? You've woken... a bit early...\"\n\nThe youth pursed his lips, a fawning expression on his face, and said:\n\n\"I thought I'd wake up early to weed it and pick off your lice, Old Ancestor.\"\n\nThe youth,\n\nwasn't telling the truth.\n\nThe colossal beast below seemed pleased with this answer. It slowly lowered its head and said:\n\n\"You've taken the trouble... It wasn't in vain that I... sought a Judge's commission... for you from the Bodhisattva...\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed! Without you, Old Ancestor, I would still be just a wandering spirit in the Underworld. How could I have achieved such fortune today?\"\n\nThe youth began weeding around the scholar tree,\n\nvery diligently,\n\nwith utmost care.\n\n---\n^1. \"大雕萌妹\" (dà diāo méng mèi): A modern Chinese internet slang term, literally \"big-penis cute girl,\" used humorously to describe someone who looks gentle and delicate but possesses immense power or a surprisingly masculine quality.\n^2. \"殺馬特\" (shāmǎtè): A transliteration of \"smart\" or \"Smash\" (referring to emo/scene kids' hairstyle) associated with a fashion subculture in China popular in the 2000s, characterized by brightly dyed, spiky, often messy hair, heavy makeup, and exaggerated clothing, similar to emo or scene kid styles, often seen as unconventional or even ridiculous.",

    "content": "My name is Sun Qiu, a ninth-grader at Pingchao Middle School.\n\nOur school is very large, with many students, most of whom are boarders. So, generally after 9:30 PM, students are dismissed from evening self-study to return to their dorms and prepare for rest.\n\nEvening self-study usually ends at 9:30 PM, and lights out is required at 10:00 PM.\n\nOur dorm room is on the sixth floor, and there are eight of us. Actually, the time between the end of evening self-study and lights out is really too short. During this period, we usually have to rush back to the dorm, then wash clothes, socks, and shower. Basically, by the time these tasks are done, or even before we've finished, a whistle blows in the hallway outside – it's the dorm supervisors telling us it's lights out.\n\nThe dorm supervisors are all very strict, middle-aged men who look quite fierce. And to be honest, most of them have a strong tendency to throw their weight around.\n\nThey see us as students and scold us at the slightest provocation. They don't have high academic qualifications, yet each one loves to play the mentor, sometimes deliberately looking for trouble to scold students.\n\nWhat's more, when they scold students, it's quite comical. It's like a big leader holding a meeting; they scold us first to satisfy their own urge, treating students who return to the dorm late or read novels or use their phones in the dorm as if they were criminals. After they've finished talking and are tired and satisfied, they'll even tell the students to grasp the spirit of their speech.\n\nAt the same time, they make students stand in the office and write so-called self-criticism and reflection reports, deeply reflecting on their problems, even dictating the word count.\n\nActually, they just bully us junior high students because we're more obedient and younger. With high school students, they don't dare to be so cocky.\n\nSo, we all really hate them. They'll wander outside the dorm rooms after lights out. Our dorm room doors have a window in the middle, through which you can see inside, and they love to peer in from there.\n\nIf someone talks, uses a flashlight, or a phone after lights out, they'll immediately pull out their keys and rush in like mad dogs, confiscating your belongings, pulling you out of bed, and taking you to the hallway outside or to their office for a scolding.\n\nTherefore, every time after lights out, my roommates and I don't dare to speak loudly, afraid they'll hear us from outside. Any roommate using a phone always hides under the covers to do so.\n\nI particularly like reading novels, and since my phone was confiscated a while ago, I'd pull the covers over my head, hiding inside and using a flashlight to read.\n\nIn the past, I could read like that all night. After all, school life is too boring. We only get two days off a month to go home and leave school grounds; otherwise, we're stuck at school.\n\nMorning self-study starts at 6:30 AM and continues until evening self-study ends at 9:30 PM. Both our morning and evening self-study sessions are used by teachers for classes, so there's no such thing as 'voluntary' or 'non-voluntary'.\n\nSo, for me, the only entertainment and pleasure was reading novels in the dorm during sleeping hours.\n\nThat night, I started reading novels quite early, wrapping myself tightly in my blanket.\n\nIt was actually very hot now, and wrapping myself in the blanket made me sweat easily; it was stuffy and uncomfortable. But I couldn't care less. I'd just turn off the flashlight every now and then, stick my head out for a few breaths of fresh air, and then continue burying myself in to read.\n\nAround 2:00 AM, my roommates were all asleep, so I got out of bed to go to the bathroom.\n\nOh, right. Our dorm room has four bunk beds, meaning eight people can live there. My bunk is the top one, near the window balcony.\n\nThe dorm room has a separate, very small bathroom, just big enough for a toilet.\n\nI didn't dare bring the book into the bathroom to read, because if the bathroom light stays on for a bit too long, and a dorm supervisor notices, they might just grab their keys, quickly open the main door, and then push open the bathroom door to check on you. They open doors with keys incredibly fast; they've practiced!\n\nOne of my roommates was in the bathroom, watching his MP4 while doing his own 'air defense'* when a dorm supervisor suddenly burst in. He was caught red-handed, 'man and 'evidence' all there'. This led to him writing several self-criticism reports, and his parents were called in. Later, that roommate stopped looking at those things, but he got closer and closer with his male deskmate.\n\nSorry, I got sidetracked. That night, I was sitting on the toilet, relieving myself while thinking about the novel's plot, when I heard footsteps from outside.\n\nMy heart immediately dropped. I was glad I hadn't brought the novel into the bathroom, otherwise, if that mad dog had set his sights on me, I'd be finished.\n\nWhen I finished and walked out of the bathroom, I suddenly heard faint, rustling sounds outside the door. I silently lowered my head and, through the crack in the door, I saw a pair of leather shoes.\n\nSomeone was indeed standing outside. He was watching me, waiting for me. I quietly took a deep breath, preparing to go back to bed. But after only a few steps, a question suddenly occurred to me.\n\nThat is, the glass panel on our dorm room door isn't actually high. I can stand there and see inside through the glass. But why, when this dorm supervisor was standing there, did I only see his shoes and not his face?\n\nWas he crouching there, deliberately waiting for me to reveal a flaw?\n\nThat sneaky?\n\nDamn it, what a crafty old fox!\n\n\"Shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh...\"\n\nFrom the other side of the door came a faint, light scratching sound. I heard it; it was like someone was rubbing a keychain against the wooden dorm door.\n\nI wasn't holding a novel, so I had nothing to fear. After hearing the sound, I didn't rush to get into bed. Instead, I walked directly to the door, pressed my face against the glass, intending to see what was happening outside, to see what the dorm supervisor was actually doing.\n\nBut when I pressed my face against the glass, I found that it was empty outside; there was no one there at all, and no one was crouching.\n\nI pulled my head back, then bent down again to look through the crack in the door, but there really was a pair of leather shoes there.\n\nWho left their leather shoes here?\n\nI opened the dorm room door. To be honest, I wasn't really scared then, nor did I think much of it. After opening the door, I found that there were no leather shoes outside the dorm door at all.\n\nI paused, completely at a loss.\n\n\"What are you doing? Why are you opening the door!\"\n\nA scolding voice came from afar. I saw a dark figure approaching from the end of the hallway, pointing at me. I couldn't clearly see which dorm supervisor it was; the hallway light there had a problem and wasn't very bright. But I was still so scared that I immediately closed the dorm door and quickly climbed into my bunk.\n\nI didn't dare immediately wrap myself tightly in the blanket and turn on my flashlight to read. I was afraid my recent actions had drawn the dorm supervisor's attention, and he might specifically watch our dorm room. If he found even a tiny flicker of light from me, I'd be finished.\n\nFurthermore, I was worried he might use this as an excuse to open our dorm door and scold me for opening it and sticking my head out just now.\n\nI waited and waited. I waited for a long time.\n\nThis was a contest of patience,\n\na game between a hunter and a wolf.\n\nTruly, this is no exaggeration.\n\nI really wanted to continue reading my novel, to remain immersed in its world, but I didn't dare. Because after I got into bed, I kept faintly hearing the sound of leather shoes echoing in the hallway outside, sometimes distant, sometimes close.\n\nI checked the time on my watch; it was already 2:30 AM.\n\nDamn it, they were still hunting for prey at this hour!\n\nThat sound of leather shoes bothered me for a long time. I desperately wanted to turn on my flashlight and keep reading, but I truly didn't dare.\n\nFrom 2:30 to 3:00, the sound of leather shoes practically never stopped, appearing intermittently. In my mind, I cursed that dorm supervisor countless times.\n\nIf he didn't leave, I couldn't read my novel. It was truly frustrating.\n\nAt the time, I even wondered if he had just gotten divorced and was in a bad mood, so he wanted to find someone who made a mistake to scold that night, which was why he was still so persistent at this hour.\n\nJust then, our dorm room door opened.\n\nI was startled, immediately closed my eyes, and pretended to be asleep.\n\nMy novel and flashlight were already under my blanket, and I was lying in bed not doing anything else when he came in, so I wasn't afraid inside.\n\nThe sound of leather shoes began to slowly approach;\n\nDrip-drop, drip-drop, drip-drop...\n\nAccompanied by the sound of something dripping.\n\nMoreover, I suddenly felt a breeze, and I was a bit cold, my body starting to shiver uncontrollably.\n\nPerhaps it was because the dorm door was open and the balcony window wasn't closed, creating a draft.\n\nThe leather shoes walked to my side and stopped for a moment. I made myself maintain steady breathing. At that moment, I thought my acting was quite good.\n\nThe leather shoes stayed by my side for a moment, then he silently left, and the door closed.\n\nI didn't dare move, continuing to lie there.\n\nAbout two minutes later, the door opened again, then I heard the sound of leather shoes again, and the door closed.\n\nSon of a b*tch!\n\nThe first time he closed the door, he didn't leave; he was waiting for me to make a move!\n\nGood thing I was alert!\n\nSon of a b*tch!\n\nFinally, the sound of leather shoes was gone from outside.\n\nI let out a long breath, then immediately pulled the covers over myself, turned on my flashlight, and continued reading my novel.\n\nI read for about another half an hour, really enjoying it; it was right at the exciting part.\n\n\"Thud...\"\n\nI heard a sound from the balcony.\n\nI turned off my flashlight in confusion and poked my head out from under the blanket. I wasn't afraid of sounds from the balcony; as long as it wasn't from the hallway, it was fine.\n\nI stretched my head out from the bed and looked towards the balcony. Actually, due to the moonlight, visibility on the balcony was quite good. I thought perhaps someone's clothes had fallen off while drying outside, but I found no fallen clothes on the balcony floor.\n\nThen, I was so scared my mouth dropped open.\n\nI saw it. I saw a pair of leather shoes lying on the balcony!\n\nLeather shoes! How could there be leather shoes here?\n\nWe were on the sixth floor, the top floor. No one lived above us, so nothing could be thrown down. And it was impossible for the dorm room next door to throw things over at this hour, especially leather shoes.\n\nThen, while I was in shock, a face — a face hanging upside down — slowly slid down from the wall above the balcony. My body almost froze; I just instinctively watched this adult male face slowly slide down.\n\nHis eyes were narrowed, and a greatly exaggerated smile was on his lips. Then, he opened his mouth, blew a puff of air towards my face, and said:\n\n\"Hey, caught you, didn't I? Reading a novel.\"\n\n---\n*Footnote: The original phrase \"防空\" (fángkōng) literally means \"air defense\" but is used here as a Chinese slang term, a euphemism, to refer to masturbation or other private, often sexual, activities.",

    "content": "「然後呢？」\n\n\n\n  周澤一邊喝著咖啡一邊問道。\n\n\n\n  許清朗在旁邊也一起聽著講述，嗯，當個深夜故事聽聽挺有意思的。\n\n\n\n  至於緊張感恐懼感什麼的，\n\n\n\n  別說許清朗了，連旁邊的老道也沒被嚇到絲毫。\n\n\n\n  用老道的話來說，\n\n\n\n  就是嚇個雞兒，\n\n\n\n  老子整天和一隻鬼和一頭殭屍待在一起，\n\n\n\n  我怕過麼？\n\n\n\n  我慫過麼？\n\n\n\n  我沒怕，我沒慫，\n\n\n\n  我只是，\n\n\n\n  從心。\n\n\n\n  「還有什麼？」少年愣了一下，然後笑笑道：「還有就是我嚇醒了啊，原來是一場夢，不過這夢就像是真的一樣，呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  少年說完後，打了一個呵欠，然後拿起之前從書架上取下的小說書看了起來，似乎是看到了什麼有趣的情節，直接笑了出來。\n\n\n\n  多麼單純的一個孩子啊，\n\n\n\n  還以為自己僅僅是做了一個夢，\n\n\n\n  那你你深更半夜跑到我這兒的書店來，\n\n\n\n  是夢遊麼？\n\n\n\n  許清朗也有些詫異地看向周澤，指了指少年，然後又指了指腦子。 \n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，\n\n\n\n  少年還不知道自己已經死了。\n\n\n\n  他以為自己還活著，但他已經變成了鬼魂，早就開始遊蕩著了。\n\n\n\n  「不收了他？」許清朗問道，「你不就差一個了麼？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗剛從樓上下來，就看見周澤坐在少年對面，聽少年講著故事，他可不會認為周澤是擔心學校里有什麼厲鬼作祟所以留著少年當線索準備去替天行道，拯救蒼生。\n\n\n\n  他清楚，周老闆這陣子為了那最後一點的百分之一，簡直望眼欲穿了，饑渴得不要不要的。\n\n\n\n  「收不了，他靈魂不全。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，有些無奈。\n\n\n\n  許清朗皺了皺眉，仔細看了一眼少年，這才發現了一些細節，少年靈魂不全，三魂六魄丟了幾味，這才使得少年變成鬼後還這般「天真爛漫」，還不知道自己已經死了。\n\n\n\n  哪怕周圍這麼多不符合邏輯的事情，哪怕他深更半夜沒在學校卻出現在了書屋，\n\n\n\n  他也沒覺得絲毫的不對勁，依舊覺得自己還活著。\n\n\n\n  簡單地說，就是他現在腦子有點問題，\n\n\n\n  一種很高級的……\n\n\n\n  智障。\n\n\n\n  周澤其實見到他第一眼，就直接打開了地獄之門， \n\n\n\n  你怎麼死的？\n\n\n\n  你有什麼冤屈？\n\n\n\n  你餓不餓？渴不渴？\n\n\n\n  什麼都沒問，根本就沒空聽他嗶嗶，直接打算送他進去好讓自己轉正，結果送不進去，讓周澤一陣鬱悶無語。\n\n\n\n  「然後呢，你打算怎麼辦？」許清朗看著周澤，提醒道：「能殺人的鬼，你能無動於衷？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗說得對，這件事，周澤還真不能無動於衷，雖然這不是超級英雄電影裡蜘蛛俠養父對他說的「能力越大責任越大」的廢話，但周澤既然身為這裡的鬼差，他就有職責讓這附近不會出現鬼魂作亂的情況，如果出現了，那也必須儘快解決。\n\n\n\n  陰司，\n\n\n\n  都看在眼裡的。\n\n\n\n  「去吧。」周澤點點頭，「你陪我一起去麼？」\n\n\n\n  「不去，我下來是準備拿面膜的，等會兒上去睡個美容覺。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗很是慵懶地躺在沙發上，那一種身段柔情，能把鋼板扳彎。\n\n\n\n  周澤有時候對許清朗也有些無奈，他明明那方面很正常，能讓一個女人當作鴨子睡了一覺後，還覺得活兒好留下了三千塊錢在床頭櫃，\n\n\n\n  足以說明許清朗那方面是沒問題的，但他有時候隨性起來表現出來的姿態，不化妝的白鶯鶯還真比不過他。 \n\n\n\n  天生媚骨啊，\n\n\n\n  許清朗生在當代是他運氣好，如果在古代，估計早就被普遍有斷袖癖好的帝王和貴族們拿去蹂躪了。\n\n\n\n  老道這個時候馬上自告奮勇，主動上來從周澤手中接過車鑰匙，道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，鶯鶯在上面吃雞呢，沒空，貧道來陪你去，除魔衛道本就是我正道人士的責任。」\n\n\n\n  就這樣，老道開著車，周澤坐在副駕駛上面，開車去了那所平潮中學。\n\n\n\n  距離其實有點遠的，開車要半個小時。\n\n\n\n  這所中學，確實很大，校門口是一個牌坊，上面寫著「省重點平中」，然後是一個門衛亭，緊接著更誇張的是，後面是一條運河，學校在運河對岸，這裡有一座橋，橫跨運河，屬於學校內部的，在橋另一端還有一個門衛亭。\n\n\n\n  所以說，寄宿在這裡的學生，想逃學有點天方夜譚，兩道門衛室關卡守著，除非游泳橫渡運河才可能去到外面的街區鎮上。\n\n\n\n  老道憑藉著自己三寸不爛之舌，直接忽悠門衛說自己孫子在裡面突發心臟病趕緊進去看情況，門衛不敢耽擱，馬上開了門，對於一看就不是學生的人，門衛倒沒有太多警戒。\n\n\n\n  車子開入了校園，周澤和老道下車步行來到了生活區，這裡真的像是一個獨立的小鎮，有澡堂子，有超市，有很多個食堂。 \n\n\n\n  學生們就像是關在流水線籠子上連轉身都不能轉的雞，每天定時喝水吃飯然後下蛋。\n\n\n\n  到這裡時，已經接近零點了，宿舍樓這邊基本都已經熄燈，除了底層的宿管老師辦公室那裡還亮著燈以外，其他樓層都是黑黢黢的一片，明明注滿了人，但卻給人一種鬼域一般的陰森感。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，到底哪座樓鬧鬼？」\n\n\n\n  「他說他住在B座。」周澤指了指斜側方向的一座，「應該是這裡。」\n\n\n\n  「哪間宿舍？」老道問道。\n\n\n\n  「六樓吧，具體哪個宿舍我不知道，上去隨便找個學生問問，哪裡剛死過人就好了。」\n\n\n\n  「這個辦法好。」老道送上一記沒誠意的馬屁。\n\n\n\n  媽的，\n\n\n\n  在店裡不問好了出來。\n\n\n\n  宿舍樓底層的宿管辦公室里幾個男人坐在那裡聊著天，嗓門兒很大，時不時地發出笑聲，像是在聊什麼葷段子。\n\n\n\n  哪怕是周澤和老道兩個人走進過道時，他們也沒留意到，這裡的管理，也確實夠鬆散的。\n\n\n\n  或者說，\n\n\n\n  這叫外松內緊？\n\n\n\n  上了六樓，這裡都熄燈了，老道隨便找了個宿舍敲了敲門，宿舍里的學生還以為是宿管老師來了，之前還有說話的聲音一下子變得寂靜無聲。 \n\n\n\n  老道又敲了幾下，\n\n\n\n  一個學生穿著拖鞋走過來把門打開，看見老道以及周澤時，愣了一下，顯然，他發現這兩個人不是宿管老師。\n\n\n\n  「警察。」\n\n\n\n  老道把自己的錢包拿出來晃了一下，反正黑燈瞎火的，裝個逼就收回。\n\n\n\n  「這裡哪間宿舍剛死了人？」老道問道。\n\n\n\n  那個學生直接懵比了，\n\n\n\n  這什麼情況，\n\n\n\n  大半夜零點了警察過來敲宿舍門問哪裡死人了？\n\n\n\n  「死人了？」學生有些吃驚地看著老道。\n\n\n\n  「對啊，問你哪裡死人了。」\n\n\n\n  「什麼時候死的？」男生詫異道。\n\n\n\n  「別裝！」老道上前一步，呵斥道：「是不是學校想隱瞞消息叫你們封口了？我們是警察，你對我們撒謊沒用。\n\n\n\n  將來要是出了什麼問題，你也是要負責任的。」\n\n\n\n  學生徹底被嚇呆了，扭過頭問自己後面床上的室友：「我們這邊死人了？」\n\n\n\n  室友那邊也開始嘰嘰喳喳起來，大家都很莫名其妙。\n\n\n\n  最令老道意外的是，這幫學生似乎是真的在莫名其妙，這不像是裝的，這是高中，可不是什麼電影學院。 \n\n\n\n  「孫秋，孫秋在哪個宿舍？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「孫秋啊，他在對面那間。」\n\n\n\n  男生指了指對面宿舍門說道。\n\n\n\n  「好了，沒你事兒了，回去睡覺，不准吵吵。」老道頤氣指使地說道。\n\n\n\n  轉過身，老道去敲對面宿舍的門。\n\n\n\n  也是很快就有一個戴著眼鏡的男生走過來打開了宿舍門。\n\n\n\n  老道和周澤直接走了進去，開門的男生有些茫然。\n\n\n\n  「我記得他說他的床鋪是靠窗戶的上鋪，這裡是吧？」\n\n\n\n  老道指了指那個床鋪，讓他有些意外的是，那個床鋪上居然睡著一個人，還蓋著被子。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼回事，剛死過人的地方還有人睡？」老道有些意外。\n\n\n\n  「你們是誰？」\n\n\n\n  宿舍里一個男生問道。\n\n\n\n  「孫秋是這個宿舍的麼？他死了多久了？」老道問道。\n\n\n\n  「孫秋？」那個男生愣了一下，然後喊道：「孫秋，醒醒，有人找你。」\n\n\n\n  啥？\n\n\n\n  老道震驚地回過頭，\n\n\n\n  隨即，\n\n\n\n  他看見那個鋪位上的男生掀開了被子，揉了揉眼，然後坐起了身子，看了看老道和周澤，問道： \n\n\n\n  「誰找我？」\n\n\n\n  一副很困的模樣。\n\n\n\n  不是同名同姓的巧合，\n\n\n\n  這模樣，\n\n\n\n  分明就是那個一個小時前還在書店裡講故事的少年模樣！\n\n\n\n  老道眼睛都瞪大了，\n\n\n\n  怎麼回事？\n\n\n\n  人不是已經死了麼？\n\n\n\n  鬼魂都飄出來了，那這個躺在床上的人是誰？\n\n\n\n  這個時候，周澤直接伸手攥住了孫秋的手腕，孫秋皺了皺眉，也沒大喊大叫，像是反應有些遲鈍一樣。\n\n\n\n  周澤擼起孫秋的袖子，拿手機手電筒照了一下，\n\n\n\n  只見在孫秋的手臂上，\n\n\n\n  密密麻麻地布滿了屍斑！\n\n\n\n  這不是活人，\n\n\n\n  這是早就死去多時的屍體！\n\n\n\n  老道看到這一幕，也是嚇得張開了嘴。\n\n\n\n  周澤不動聲色地把孫秋的袖子放下來，「沒事了，你們早點睡覺，別鬧。」\n\n\n\n  說完，周澤走出了這個宿舍。\n\n\n\n  老道馬上跟了出來，急不可耐地問道：「老闆，怎麼回事，這人到底是死了還是沒死？」 \n\n\n\n  「死了。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  「那這個……」老道理解不了了。\n\n\n\n  「因為慣性。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  「慣性？」\n\n\n\n  「是的，慣性，在這個學校里，學生每天的生活時間都被安排得死死的，每天什麼時候起床什麼時候去教室什麼時候去食堂吃飯什麼時候回寢室什麼時候熄燈都是固定好的。\n\n\n\n  所以，他哪怕是死了，但長久以來的這種生活所帶來的慣性，讓他能夠繼續保持著『活著』的狀態。\n\n\n\n  因為每天，對於他來說，其實都是幾乎一個模子刻出來的。\n\n\n\n  就像是一個小球，從軌道上拋下來，它會依照它的慣性繼續地往前滾動一個道理，他現在，也是這個樣子。\n\n\n\n  你沒發現麼？\n\n\n\n  他的反應其實已經變得很遲鈍了，\n\n\n\n  但他身邊同學和老師，誰都沒發現，\n\n\n\n  他已經死了。」\n\n\n\n  「這麼玄乎？」\n\n\n\n  「我以前當醫生時也遇到過幾例相似的情況，屍檢來看已經死了好多天的屍體，結果他的同事或者家人都說，在昨天還看見他在照常去上班照常生活。」\n\n\n\n  「怎麼會這樣？」老道砸吧砸吧了嘴，理解不了啊。 \n\n\n\n  「一成不變的生活，每天的行為模式都是固定的，就像是一輛可以自動化的機器；\n\n\n\n  駕駛員是活著，還是死了，\n\n\n\n  有區別？」",

    "content": "Death is not terrifying; what's truly terrifying is being forgotten.\n\nSun Qiu was dead, had been dead for a long time, but his classmates didn't know, his teachers didn't know, and even he himself didn't know. Driven by this inertia, he seemed to still be \"alive.\"\n\nHowever,\n\nThis kind of living, in itself, was a very tragic and pitiful thing.\n\nJust imagine, your life, your existence, the trajectory of your every day, whether your consciousness is present or not, is actually unchanging.\n\nThen, your existence, your life, setting aside appearances, how much meaning does it still hold?\n\nZhou Ze remembered an incident that occurred in Hong Kong previously, quite famous online, often compiled as one of Hong Kong's top ten or eight supernatural events.\n\nIt was about a delivery person from a restaurant going to deliver food, standing outside the door and still hearing the sound of Mahjong inside, but after knocking and opening the door, discovering that the four Mahjong players inside had already been dead for a long time.\n\nThis was a very typical example.\n\n\"Boss, he's already dead, so what do we do?\" the old Daoist asked, posing the problem.\n\nBecause living people seeing ghosts is rare.\n\nBut if dead people see ghosts, that's not rare; it's as common as fellow villagers seeing each other, tears welling in their eyes.footnote:[An idiom meaning a common, expected, or deeply familiar sight, akin to \"two peas in a pod\" but with a nuance of shared experience or recognition.]\n\nMoreover, Sun Qiu's death was likely not caused by a ghost; in the story he recounted, he was likely already dead at the time, which is why he witnessed some strange phenomena.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. The problem now was that he couldn't determine Sun Qiu's time of death, which meant he couldn't ascertain whether Sun Qiu died from a natural accident or was harmed by a ghost.\n\nAs for Sun Qiu's incomplete soul, there were actually many possibilities; it wasn't necessarily controlled by some more powerful ghost.\n\n\"Let's go down and ask first, ask those dorm supervisors.\"\n\nSince many pieces of information about Sun Qiu were cut off and couldn't be reconnected because he was now a \"high-level intellectually disabled\" person, they could only look for a breakthrough elsewhere.\n\nIn short, what Zhou Ze needed was a ghost. If Sun Qiu couldn't be captured, then capturing the soul of that dorm supervisor teacher would be the same.\n\nIt had a strong sense of \"after three years in the barracks, even a sow looks like Diao Chan.\"footnote:[An idiom meaning that in conditions of extreme deprivation or isolation, even something typically unattractive can become appealing.]\n\nThey went down the stairs and arrived at the dorm supervisor's office on the first floor. Inside, two middle-aged men were still talking. The other few from before had either gotten off work or perhaps gone off to search for \"prey.\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze and the old Daoist finally caught their attention.\n\n\"What are you doing!\"\n\nOne of the men with a flat-top haircut pointed directly at Zhou Ze and asked.\n\nZhou Ze took out a cigarette, bit it, and this time, instead of letting the old Daoist ask, he opened his mouth and said:\n\n\"I have something to ask you. Has someone died among your dorm supervisors recently?\"\n\nAs soon as Zhou Ze finished speaking, the expressions of the two dorm supervisors immediately changed.\n\n\"Are you police or what?\" the flat-top asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Then are you a student's parent?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head again.\n\n\"Then why are you asking so many questions? This is a school; irrelevant people, please leave.\" The flat-top walked over and pushed Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed the other party's wrist. His little finger's nail grew out, directly touching the other's skin.\n\n\"A sharp gasp...\"\n\nThe flat-top immediately fell to his knees, his face twisted in obvious agony.\n\nThe other dorm supervisor, seeing this scene, didn't cower and directly charged over.\n\n\"This humble Daoist has come to escort you!\"\n\nThe old Daoist actively rushed over at this moment. After their shoulders collided, the old Daoist directly performed an over-the-shoulder throw, slamming the other man to the ground. This supervisor was almost knocked out.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\nZhou Ze dragged a chair over, sat down, and let the man remain kneeling before him like that.\n\nThe flat-top's gaze at Zhou Ze was filled with intense terror, but he didn't answer Zhou Ze's question, instead asking, \"Who exactly are you, and what do you want... Ahhh!\"\n\nZhou Ze's nail touched the flat-top's skin again. At the same time, Zhou Ze pulled up the man's shirt to cover his mouth, preventing him from screaming.\n\n\"Scream, go ahead, scream till your throat rips, no one will pay attention to you.\"\n\nThe old Daoist gloated from the side.\n\n\"Whatever I ask, you answer.\"\n\nBoss Zhou had been mentally exhausted for a long time due to that one percent performance target, truly not wanting to babble anymore with irrelevant people.\n\n\"Has a dorm supervisor died recently?\"\n\nThe flat-top was in so much pain that tears and snot flowed out. This time, he was truly afraid, and immediately nodded, saying:\n\n\"Yes, there was one. He died last month in an accident. His name was Wang Baogang.\"\n\n\"How did he die?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He jumped. He died by jumping from the dorm building. His head hit the ground; he was killed instantly.\"\n\n\"Oh, did he have any special quirks, like liking to wear leather shoes?\"\n\nGenerally speaking, it's normal for adults to wear leather shoes, especially in certain work settings. But this was a school. While dorm supervisors were politely called teachers, in reality, the school just hired some strong young men to act as \"thugs\"; they had nothing to do with being teachers.\n\nThe two men in the room were wearing slippers and sneakers respectively. For someone to wear leather shoes and formally inspect dorms was quite unusual.\n\n\"Yes, he liked wearing leather shoes and suits. We used to joke that he really thought of himself as a people's teacher, always coming to work dressed to the nines for roll call.\"\n\n\"Where did he die?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Right in the flowerbed in front of this building,\" the flat-top said, pointing. \"His room was on the first floor. He used to share a room with me. After his accident, I moved out and lived with others.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Take me to his room to have a look.\"\n\nEscorting the flat-top, they entered a dorm room. It had the same layout as a student dorm, but there were no bunk beds, only a large bed and power outlets.\n\n\"Did no one claim his belongings?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No. He only had one older sister, who was out of town. The school notified her when he died. She came, and the school paid out compensation for work-related injury. She didn't cause a fuss and left after the funeral arrangements were handled. She didn't intend to take his things either.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. There were still some clothes in the wardrobe. Crucially, under the bedside table, there were two pairs of leather shoes.\n\n\"These are the leather shoes he usually wore,\" the flat-top explained.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down in front of the leather shoes, picked up one, and felt its sole. There was some mud on it that hadn't completely dried.\n\nThe dorm was very damp, especially the hallway.\n\nGenerally, when dorm supervisors inspected dorms, their shoe soles would often get wet. But according to what the flat-top said, this Wang Baogang had already died last month. His shoes should have been left here all this time, so how could they be wet?\n\n\"Why did Wang Baogang jump?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I don't know that,\" the flat-top shook his head. \"He didn't seem to have been provoked. That night, everything was as usual. He took his bunch of keys and went to inspect the dorms.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around, searching.\n\nOne must know, whether or not Wang Baogang's soul killed Sun Qiu, at least one thing could be proven: Wang Baogang's soul was still wandering in this dorm building.\n\n\"You can go now. You can call the police,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe flat-top froze for a moment, then backed out of the room. As for whether he would call the police, Zhou Ze wasn't really worried.\n\nAfterward, only Zhou Ze was left in the room. All of Zhou Ze's right fingernails grew out, a swirl of black qi encircled his palm. Immediately after, Zhou Ze touched his fingertips to the tile, and the black qi seeped into the tile.\n\nNot long after,\n\nStarting from where the shoes were placed by the bedside table, black footprints appeared, visible only to Zhou Ze. The footprints extended continuously.\n\nZhou Ze opened the dorm room door and followed the footprints upstairs,\n\nUpstairs,\n\nThe footprints continuously moved back and forth in the hallway,\n\nAt the entrances of student dorm rooms, sometimes complex, sometimes varying in depth.\n\nThis meant that even though Wang Baogang was dead, he was still carrying out his duties as a dorm supervisor.\n\nHe was still inspecting dorms, still watching the students, still checking on their bedtime. Late at night, he would wander the hallways, standing at doors for a long time, waiting for a long time.\n\nHe was already dead,\n\nSo he had a lot of time,\n\nTo better dedicate to his work.\n\nThe students in the dorms were unaware that while they had to battle wits and courage with the living dorm supervisors, they also had to face the gaze of a ghost!\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze's gaze slightly sharpened. He saw that outside the door of a dorm room at the end of the hallway, the black footprints were most concentrated.\n\nThis meant that Wang Baogang had lingered here for a very, very long time. One could even discern his inner struggle and hesitation from the footprints.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the door of that dorm room. Somewhat unexpectedly, a white slip of paper with \"Storage Room\" written on it was affixed, meaning this dorm was abandoned and no students lived there.\n\nZhou Ze reached out to open the door, but it was locked. His nail dug in, and with a slight exertion of force, the lock was pried open. Zhou Ze still walked inside.\n\nInside the dorm room, the bed was empty, and below it, various sundries like mops and brooms were piled up. Nothing seemed unusual.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that if Wang Baogang had struggled here for so long, there must be something special about this place.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the dusty bed frame. The bed creaked.\n\nNight,\n\nVery quiet,\n\nUnnaturally quiet.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's vision began to blur. He suddenly stood up, and the blurry feeling instantly vanished. As a Ghost Messenger, he couldn't fall asleep normally.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze felt this was a kind of torture, but later he slowly realized that the inability to sleep normally might also be a guarantee that Ghost Messengers wouldn't be affected by specters.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nBelow, the sound of gushing spring water emerged, and a strong smell of blood emanated from all around.\n\nZhou Ze slowly began to back away. However, when Zhou Ze turned around, he found that the door he had entered through had become a wall.\n\nAnd beneath this dorm room,\n\nFresh red blood began to spread,\n\nIn the distance, it was as if a sea of blood was surging forth, a wave roaring in and instantly submerging the entire dorm room.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nZhou Ze was entirely submerged in the blood. Everything around was covered in a deep crimson glow, giving Zhou Ze a feeling akin to his first time walking the Yellow Springs and entering the pool.\n\nAt this moment, a \"tap-tap\" sound came from outside the wall,\n\nAs if someone wearing leather shoes was slowly approaching,\n\nHe got closer and closer,\n\nThen walked to a spot separated by just one wall from Zhou Ze,\n\nHe knocked on the wall,\n\nAnd said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Lights out, turn off the lights!\"\n\n\"Slam!\"\n\nWithin the blood, a mass of black ink seemed to be madly spreading,\n\nThe originally crimson expanse instantly transformed into a dense, oppressive darkness,\n\nAs if,\n\nThe lights,\n\nWere turned off...",

    "content": "It was pitch black; one couldn't see their hand in front of their face. The viscous, restrictive sensation all around was so clear, making it difficult for Zhou Ze to distinguish whether this was an illusion or reality.\n\nThis counted as very high-level treatment, meaning this ghost's depth and spiritual attainment had reached a certain realm; it wasn't the ordinary kind that would walk into his bookstore on its own.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when Madam Bai had hosted him and Xu Qinglang, she also used a similar ability, making it difficult to distinguish between virtual and real. Xu Qinglang had even eaten many dishes made of flies and earthworms then.\n\nWang Baogang might not be the behind-the-scenes entity. He wasn't capable enough; having died for such a short time, it was impossible for him to become so powerful. Therefore, it also meant that the one who killed Sun Qiu and prevented Sun Qiu's soul from being complete was someone else entirely.\n\nZhou Ze slowly spread his arms. The swaying sensation all around him gave him the illusion of walking in outer space, as if gravity had been completely drained away at that moment.\n\nBut as Zhou Ze's fingernails extended, black mist scattered wildly, and the surrounding black, viscous blood began to recede rapidly, as if it had encountered a natural predator.\n\nHaving reached today step by step, the current Zhou Ze was no longer the inexperienced Wu Xia Ameng of yesteryear*. Even when encountering such a situation, a sense of calm and confidence still flowed from him.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nA crisp sound.\n\nA broom fell to the ground.\n\nThe sanguine color completely disappeared.\n\nThe dormitory was completely empty.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked behind him. The dormitory door was open, and outside, a pair of black leather shoes lay quietly there.\n\nAs if someone was standing right in front of him.\n\nA moment later,\n\nThe leather shoes moved on their own, starting to walk out—no, to run out.\n\nZhou Ze rushed out, chasing the leather shoes down the stairs. The leather shoes ran faster and faster, but Zhou Ze's speed wasn't slow either. In fact, Zhou Ze deliberately slowed his pace, just waiting to see where these leather shoes would lead him.\n\nHe was only one lost soul away from becoming a regular employee. But the problem was this one percent quota had given him an immensely large entity. Zhou Ze even speculated that the one manipulating all this behind the scenes, even if not as powerful as Madam Bai of yesteryear, would not be too far off.\n\nAfter all, the previous scene and sensation of surging blood, compared to when Madam Bai held her banquet that day, the difference in quality and resonance wasn't very big.\n\n\"Drip-drop... drip-drop... drip-drop...\"\n\nThis was the sound made by the leather shoes as they moved. Zhou Ze hadn't noticed before, but now he did: why did the leather shoes make a \"drip-drop\" sound when walking?\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly discovered that after circling around, going down one floor and up another, he had followed the leather shoes back to the outside of the dormitory that was used as a storage room.\n\nThe leather shoes went in, and Zhou Ze followed again.\n\nOnly,\n\nThis time,\n\nThe dormitory no longer looked like a storage room, nor was it a vast sea of blood. Everything had become very ordinary. There were neatly folded blankets on the beds, washbasins and plastic cabinets under the beds, and toothbrushes and towels were neatly arranged by the sink.\n\nThis was a dormitory where students lived.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the changes around him, a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth. He didn't know what the other party's purpose was, but the other party was making an elaborate display within a single dormitory.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while. This time there was no sea of blood, nor any \"gurgling\" sound. Everything seemed very quiet, as if he had walked into an ordinary dormitory.\n\nBut anyone with a bit of sense could tell that something was unusual here. Not to mention why the dormitory was empty at lights-out time, it was clearly the middle of the night, yet outside the window...\n\nWhy was sunlight still shining in?\n\n\"Scrape... scrape... scrape...\"\n\nOn the tile floor, sounds of friction came from the balcony.\n\nZhou Ze was just about to walk to the balcony to see, but he stopped in his tracks, because the thing making noise on the balcony had already crawled in.\n\nYes,\n\nHe was crawling.\n\nThis was a boy.\n\nHis lower half was completely severed at the waist, only his upper body remaining, using both hands to crawl continuously on the ground. His body was covered in bloodstains, and especially where he crawled, thick, horrifying bloodstains were left behind.\n\nThe boy tilted his head, crawling and looking at Zhou Ze.\n\nHe seemed to be sizing up Zhou Ze, filled with a kind of curiosity towards him, but he did not stop crawling towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down, to be at eye level with the boy in front of him.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nThe boy opened his mouth, but as he prepared to speak, fresh blood began to gush continuously from his mouth; it simply wouldn't stop. He looked at Zhou Ze, his mouth continuously opening and closing, but he couldn't produce any clear syllables.\n\nHe seemed a bit anxious, but the more anxious he was, the less sound he could make. In the end, it even turned into a sound similar to a dog's bark!\n\nHis severed body trembled; his entire being was enraged.\n\nHe wanted to speak, he wanted to tell Zhou Ze something, but he couldn't!\n\nHe was utterly frenzied; his half-body rolled on the ground, continuously pounding the tile floor with his fists.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, tapped the bloodstains on the ground with his finger, then gently drew on the tile floor.\n\nMeaning,\n\nYou can't speak,\n\nYou can write.\n\nThe boy paused for a moment, seeming to just realize there was this method. He immediately nodded, dipped his finger in his own blood, and prepared to write on the ground.\n\nBut just as he wrote a horizontal stroke,\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe boy's index finger snapped off directly.\n\nThe boy froze.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze also hardened.\n\nBut the boy refused to give up. He continued to write with his ring finger, but this time, he couldn't even write a single stroke; his ring finger snapped off directly as soon as it touched the tile.\n\nThe boy used his thumb; the thumb snapped off.\n\nThe boy used his pinky finger; the pinky finger snapped off.\n\nIn the end,\n\nThe boy despaired; he raised his arm,\n\nSticking up his only middle finger,\n\nRoaring continuously.\n\nThis middle finger was his, yet it was a mockery from another entity towards him.\n\nThe boy looked at Zhou Ze, then looked at a cabinet to one side.\n\nThat was an iron cabinet, divided into eight compartments, meaning each of the eight people in the dormitory could use one compartment for their belongings.\n\nThe boy's gaze was fixed on the bottom-most cabinet. Zhou Ze walked over and opened it.\n\n\"Creak... creak...\"\n\nWhat was revealed was a leg, and there was something else inside, like a piece of clothing neatly folded and placed there.\n\nBut in reality,\n\nThis was a person's,\n\nLower half!\n\nThe boy desperately crawled towards that cabinet, and the two legs inside the cabinet were constantly thrashing as if responding. But this entire lower body was folded too neatly; in this narrow space, it simply couldn't move freely or walk out on its own, only able to kick and writhe restlessly in vain.\n\nThis was a very eerie scene, enough to make one's scalp tingle.\n\nJust as the boy was about to touch his feet,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nAs if something was dragging the boy from behind, he was pulled, constantly retreating towards the balcony. The boy struggled, roared, and bellowed continuously, his body rolling back and forth on the tile floor.\n\nBut he was like a fish on a chopping board; all his struggles seemed so pale and powerless.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and chased after it, but as soon as he took a step, his vision in front of him began to rapidly retreat.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze found himself standing at the dormitory entrance,\n\nAnd the dormitory,\n\nHad returned to its original appearance.\n\nNo bloodstains, no boy, and no frustrated roaring.\n\nWhat exactly did this mean?\n\nZhou Ze found it a bit difficult to understand. This dormitory was like walking into a cinema playing ghost movies late at night; every time he came in, it always gave him a new experience.\n\n\"Drip-drop... drip-drop...\"\n\nTurning his head,\n\nSure enough,\n\nThe pair of leather shoes reappeared in the hallway behind the door.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood this time why the shoe prints outside this dormitory were so dense; it seemed to be repeatedly doing the same thing.\n\nLeading people away,\n\nThen bringing them back,\n\nThen waiting here for people to be led away again,\n\nThen bringing them back again.\n\nLike a waiter,\n\n\"Welcome, customer?\"\n\n\"Oh, customer, take care on your way out.\"\n\nThe leather shoes seemed to be waiting for Zhou Ze to turn and look at them before they started to leave.\n\nAgain, the \"drip-drop\" sound. Zhou Ze walked over, only this time, the confusion in Zhou Ze's heart couldn't be resolved. First and foremost, why did these leather shoes, when walking,\n\nMake a \"drip-drop\" sound?\n\nShouldn't it be \"pat-pat-pat,\"\n\nOr \"scrape-scrape-scrape\" sounds?\n\nZhou Ze reached out, and black mist from his fingertips began to release, directly enveloping the pair of black leather shoes.\n\nLike a net cast down, finally catching the fish.\n\nSlowly,\n\nThe owner of the leather shoes began to reveal his true form. He was still walking forward, still making the \"drip-drop\" sound;\n\nWith his stubbornness,\n\nWith his persistence,\n\nContinuing to walk forward.\n\n\"Drip-drop... drip-drop...\"\n\nHis head,\n\nWas half rotten,\n\nUpside down,\n\nHis half-head repeatedly struck the tile floor;\n\n\"Drip-drop... drip-drop...\"\n\nHe kept bouncing. Every time he landed, it was his head striking the ground.\n\nHis hands, extended into the leather shoes, swung back and forth continuously.\n\nHe was actually walking with his head,\n\nBut his two hands were holding up the leather shoes, stepping forward one by one, pretending the shoes were moving.\n\nLittle Flat-top had said that whenever Wang Baogang went to inspect rooms during his life, he liked to wear leather shoes and a suit. He considered himself a teacher, rather than a mere dormitory manager or a thug.\n\nTherefore,\n\nEven after his death,\n\nHe would maintain his dignity,\n\nEven if,\n\nHe had to walk with his hands in the leather shoes.\n\n\"Drip-drop... drip-drop...\"\n\nSun Qiu said he saw Wang Baogang's head slowly slide down from the wall above the balcony,\n\nIncluding the current sight of Wang Baogang walking by hitting his head on the ground,\n\nAlso had a reason,\n\nBecause Little Flat-top had also said that when Wang Baogang jumped off the building,\n\nIt was his head,\n\nThat hit the ground first.\n\n---\n*Literally \"Wu Xia Ameng,\" an idiom referring to someone who has made remarkable progress or is no longer ignorant and inexperienced.",

    "content": "\"Creak...\"\n\nPushing open the concealed dormitory door, Old Daoist poked his head in:\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\nHowever, there was no one in the room. This was Wang Baogang's dorm room. Old Daoist had asked the short-haired Zhou Ze, who had returned from the dorm management office, where Zhou Ze had gone, and the other party replied that Zhou Ze was here.\n\nBut where was the person?\n\nOld Daoist scratched his head. The boss couldn't have just left without saying anything. Could he have gone upstairs?\n\nOld Daoist started walking up the stairs. Actually, this dorm building housed many, many people. Six floors, each with thirty to forty dorm rooms. Eight students crammed into each dorm room. Do the math, how many people must be in here?\n\nBut at night, the damp, gloomy environment and the almost silent corridors still gave people a chilling feeling. It must be said, this was also a strange contrast. You were clearly in a crowd, but you would still be afraid.\n\nAnd tonight, this feeling seemed even more intense.\n\nAs soon as Old Daoist went upstairs, he saw a student standing in front of him. The student was wearing a yellow sweater, holding something that looked like a drawing board, staring motionlessly at him.\n\n\"What are you looking at? Go back to sleep!\" Old Daoist reprimanded, as if possessed by a dorm supervisor.\n\nThe student nodded, turned around, and walked into the wall by the staircase.\n\n\"Uh...\" Old Daoist smacked his lips.\n\nDamn it,\n\nIs this a school or a ghost domain?\n\nThis dorm supervisor job really isn't for humans. Are they managing students or playing a ghost escape game?\n\nHis hand, reaching into his crotch, fumbled and pulled out a yellow talisman paper. Old Daoist brought it to his nose and sniffed. The papery scent of the ancestral talisman paper gave him a great sense of security.\n\nThe next moment, Old Daoist didn't rush to move, but took out his phone, preparing to call his boss.\n\nBoss, the ghost you've been searching so hard for, I've found it!\n\nHowever, after dialing, the phone showed no signal.\n\nDamn it, things are going to be bad.\n\nOld Daoist slowly retreated, then prepared to shout. At this point, he didn't care if he'd disturb the sleep of the motherland's flowers, and he didn't care about his own face or anything. With Zhou Ze not by his side, Old Daoist felt very insecure.\n\nJust as Old Daoist opened his throat, before he could make a sound, he felt as if something was stuck in his throat. He couldn't shout at all; he nearly choked.\n\nAt this, beads of sweat began to appear densely on Old Daoist's forehead. He knew, this was the ghost targeting him.\n\nDamn,\n\nWhat kind of skill is it to bully a bronze-ranked player¹? If you've got guts, go find the deceased!\n\nOld Daoist in his mind affectionately greeted all eighteen generations of the female ancestors of this ghost who bullied the weak and feared the strong, then unhesitatingly turned around, preparing to go down the stairs.\n\nCan't afford to provoke, can't afford to provoke,\n\nBut I can afford to hide!\n\nWho knew, as soon as Old Daoist went down the stairs, he saw the steps under his feet suddenly become distorted, uneven in height. Old Daoist's foot slipped, and he fell directly down. Fortunately, he was agile, otherwise, if another elderly person had fallen like that, they could have started preparing for their funeral.\n\nBut even so, Old Daoist still ended up with a bruised face and swollen nose.\n\nWhen he struggled to stand up, he saw the boy in the yellow sweater holding the drawing board still standing in front of him.\n\nHe was looking at him.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nThe pen in his hand seemed to be drawing something on the drawing board.\n\nEven a cornered rabbit bites. Old Daoist directly raised the talisman paper in his hand and charged forward. At worst, it's a mutual destruction!\n\nHowever, before he couldn't go down the stairs, now he couldn't go up. Old Daoist kept running on the stairs, but always maintained a distance of about two meters from the boy, unable to get closer.\n\nOld Daoist simply \"took off\" directly, jumped up, flinging the talisman paper in his hand.\n\nThe boy looked up, his eyes completely vacant. He raised his hand, the pen in his hand suddenly struck out, turning into a rich, heavy stroke of ink, instantly dyeing the bright yellow talisman paper black.\n\nSeeing this, Old Daoist felt despair. His ancestral talisman paper was actually dissolved so effortlessly by this ghost.\n\nIt's over,\n\nIt's over!\n\nThe jumping Old Daoist fell heavily onto the stairs, his whole body \"thump-thump\" sliding downwards.\n\nThe boy slowly walked down. Old Daoist struggled to lift his head, watching the other party constantly approaching him.\n\nAnd at this moment, the most beautiful and wonderful sound in the world, the one that made Old Daoist's eyes well up with tears, rang out.\n\n\"Oh, you're here.\"\n\nBoss Zhou's voice came.\n\nOld Daoist's originally despairing heart was instantly filled with hope!\n\nThe boy turned sideways, saw Zhou Ze behind him, and frowned slightly, as if helpless, and also as if having a headache.\n\nImmediately after, the boy began to walk towards the wall, intending to hide himself again. He seemed to have no interest in fighting Zhou Ze, and also clearly knew how thorny² this man, who had entered this dorm building for the first time today, was.\n\nBut how could Zhou Ze let him leave so easily? His fingernails directly embedded into the wall. Zhou Ze's body retreated backward, his arms exerted force, pulling back sharply!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe boy was dragged out, landed on the stairs, the drawing board and pen both dropped to the ground.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe boy's originally vacant eyes revealed a dark red color. He was angry, he was furious. Before this, he felt he had given Zhou Ze a lot of face, but Zhou Ze was a bit ungrateful despite being shown kindness³.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nA scene that surprised Zhou Ze appeared. In front of him, there was actually the sound of paper being torn. Immediately after, Zhou Ze saw the sleeve on his arm rip open, and then his skin and flesh tore open. Blood continuously flowed out.\n\nZhou Ze began to retreat. After retreating a certain distance, the previous injuries disappeared. Even Zhou Ze's previously injured arm returned to normal.\n\nWhat on earth was going on?\n\nOld Daoist, while Zhou Ze was entangled with the ghost, climbed up and prepared to sneak away, but the boy seemed to be only staring at him, instantly appearing in front of him.\n\n\"%...￥￥##@@...!\"\n\nBullying honest people!\n\nOld Daoist cursed directly in his mind.\n\n\"Pffft...\"\n\nA fountain pen,\n\nDirectly pierced Old Daoist's chest. Old Daoist lowered his head in shock. He saw the wound on his chest continuously expanding. Bright red blood began to spread out continuously, staining his entire Daoist robe crimson at an astonishing speed!\n\n\"Thump...\"\n\nOld Daoist knelt on the ground, holding the wound with both hands, watching the blood continuously overflowing onto the ground.\n\nHe felt it was unreal, very unreal. Although he knew there was a risk in coming out to catch ghosts with his boss, he really hadn't expected to die here!\n\nHimself,\n\nJust died like this?\n\nDied in this dorm building?\n\nZhou Ze had already rushed over. The boy glanced at Zhou Ze, seemed not to intend to continue attacking, and also seemed to have some reservations, once again drilled into a nearby wall.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze was about to continue pursuing and drag the boy out again in the same manner,\n\nHe found his pant leg grabbed by a pair of hands.\n\nLowering his head,\n\nHe saw,\n\nIt was Old Daoist.\n\nOld Daoist's blood-stained hands clutched Zhou Ze's pant leg, snot and tears constantly wiping onto it.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath,\n\nForcefully suppressing the urge to slap this old geezer to death first!\n\nFor someone with mysophobia, Old Daoist's current behavior,\n\nWas like carrying a dung basket and scurrying around the streets,\n\nLooking for shit (death)⁴.\n\n\"Boss, I'm done for, I'm done for, don't chase him yet, let me say my last words and arrange my affairs before you chase, I'm afraid I won't get the chance.\"\n\nOld Daoist at this moment didn't care if Zhou Ze wanted to catch ghosts. He knew he couldn't last much longer. He was afraid that by the time Zhou Ze came back after catching the ghost, he would already be dead. At that time, he wouldn't even have had time to give his last words and arrange his affairs. That would be too great a loss, too great a loss.\n\n\"Boss, under the bed in my bookstore room, there's a small box. Inside, there's a box of ancestral talismans, and in a hidden compartment, there are three bank cards. The password is the last six digits of my phone number. It's not much money, just about a million...\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nOld Daoist's body suddenly trembled. He detected a murderous intent, seemingly from his boss.\n\nOld Daoist's heart immediately warmed.\n\nAh,\n\nDon't look at how ruthless the boss usually is, seemingly not caring about anything. When he sees his good buddy, good brother, good friend, good partner, and soulmate about to depart,\n\nHe also gets angry.\n\nHe probably wishes he could immediately kill that ghost to avenge him now.\n\nAh,\n\nA long road tests a horse's strength; time reveals a person's heart⁵.\n\nOld Daoist sighed inwardly.\n\nWhat he didn't know was that when Zhou Ze heard Old Daoist say \"it's not much money, just about a million,\"\n\nA thought crossed his mind: should he just go with the flow and kill this Old Daoist to seize his property?\n\nIf Old Daoist knew the truth, he would probably spit out a mouthful of old blood and die instantly from anger.\n\n\"The talismans, just burn them in front of my grave. You can keep two for yourself.\n\nBoss, after I die, please help me donate the money to the children in the mountains. You can also keep two bills for yourself, but not too many.\n\nAlso, after I die, please help notify Mr. Liang in Shanghai and ask him to attend my memorial service. After all, it's a fate that brought us together.\n\nOf course,\n\nBoss, if you and Mr. Liang truly can't bear to part with me,\n\nYou can go together and charge into hell, and rescue this poor Daoist's departed soul. This poor Daoist won't mind!\n\nEven if I can't enter reincarnation, this poor Daoist is willing to make the sacrifice and return to the living world to continue accompanying you all!\n\nThrough wind and rain, this poor Daoist will wait for you!\"\n\nZhou Ze really couldn't listen anymore.\n\nCharge into hell?\n\nAnd for you?\n\n\"Boss, this poor Daoist can't bear to part with you. Although your temper is really bad, and you're very selfish, and unreliable⁶, and don't earn much money, I've never had the nerve to ask you for a salary.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Although you're very lustful, always earnestly letting Yingying serve you a bath, and I heard Miss Xu say that you have problems in that area, unable to get it up...\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nWhy aren't you dead yet?\n\nOr, should I see you off?\n\nYou should just die sooner,\n\nOtherwise I really can't help but kill you.\n\nOld Daoist, snot and tears streaming, continued: \"But actually, you're not a bad person. Although you have many flaws, you still have advantages, such as... uh... such as...\"\n\nOld Daoist reached out and scratched his head.\n\nIt's so hard,\n\nSuch as what, exactly?\n\nJust then, Old Daoist lost his balance and fell down, coincidentally rolling out of the spot where he had been kneeling. In an instant, Old Daoist found that all the injuries on his body had disappeared. He became clean and uninjured!\n\nDon't have to die?\n\n\"Boss, I'm okay now, I don't have to die!\"\n\nOld Daoist was so excited he lost himself.\n\nThen he saw Zhou Ze extending his fingernails towards him.\n\n\"What did you just say? I didn't hear clearly. Say it again.\"\n***\n¹ *Bronze-ranked player*: Literally \"bronze\" (青銅), referring to the lowest rank in many online gaming systems, used metaphorically to describe someone weak or inexperienced.\n² *Thorny*: Literally \"prickly hand\" (扎手), an idiom describing someone difficult to deal with, formidable, or troublesome.\n³ *Ungrateful despite being shown kindness*: Literally \"to be given face but not want face\" (給臉不要臉), an idiom meaning to refuse kindness or take advantage of generosity.\n⁴ *Looking for shit (death)*: A pun. \"找屎\" (zhǎo shǐ, looking for shit) sounds like \"找死\" (zhǎo sǐ, looking for death).\n⁵ *A long road tests a horse's strength; time reveals a person's heart*: An idiom (路遙知馬力，日久見人心) meaning that a person's true character is revealed over time.\n⁶ *Unreliable*: A colloquial term (滖) with various negative connotations, including \"unlucky,\" \"dirty,\" \"unreliable,\" or \"bad.\" Here, used as a negative personality trait.",

    "content": "「Boss, what on earth is going on?」\n\nOld Taoist was somewhat confused. He had clearly just seen himself hit by an arrow,\n\nOh no, hit by a pen.\n\nBut now he was completely fine, except for the lingering bruises and swelling on his face, but those were from his own fall.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and picked up the fallen fountain pen from the ground. The pen turned to ash the moment it was touched.\n\n「It was drawn on,」 Zhou Ze said. 「If he were really that powerful, he wouldn't be unwilling to face me directly. In fact, he could completely crush me.」\n\n「Drawn on?」\n\n「Yes, drawn on. It's like a more advanced form of hypnosis, obscuring your sight, hearing, smell, and other perceptions, and making them change according to his design.」\n\nZhou Ze looked at his arm. Previously, there had been clear marks on his arm, but now not a trace could be seen. However, that realistic visual quality was enough to make one subconsciously believe it was all real in a short amount of time.\n\n「Damn it, so he's a colleague of ours, a con artist's trick.」\n\nOld Taoist instantly regained his masculine confidence.\n\nThe Great Leader said, all reactionaries are paper tigers!¹\n\n「Boss, shall we go drag him out now?」\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, pointing out the corridor window. 「It's almost dawn, and he's already hidden away.」\n\nActually, the appearance of ghosts has little to do with day or night. At least for ghosts, there's no fundamental impact; rather, it affects humans.\n\nDuring the day, everything is in broad daylight. Even if something strange happens, ordinary people can feel a bit bolder, at least finding some psychological comfort.\n\nAt night, people are easily startled by whatever happens, thus giving ghosts an opportune moment.\n\nOf course, that ghost was a bit special. He was good at drawing, but even the best drawing and quality needed the support and cooperation of the environment. Daytime wasn't his preferred background for drawing because it would magnify the flaws in his paintings, whereas at night, his drawings could be more realistic.\n\n「So, what's next... breakfast?」\n\nZhou Ze walked towards the other end of the corridor, and Old Taoist naturally followed. Then, Old Taoist watched Zhou Ze enter a dormitory room with a \"storage room\" sign on it.\n\nInside the dormitory, besides a pile of miscellaneous items, there was also a pair of black leather shoes.\n\nZhou Ze sat on a wooden board, seemingly lost in thought.\n\n「Boss?」\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand, signaling Old Taoist to be quiet for now.\n\nOld Taoist nodded and sat down on the opposite bunk. The bruises on his body were nothing to worry about; having traveled north and south for so many years, the hardships and superficial wounds he'd suffered were countless. This was child's play.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, Zhou Ze bent down and started searching under the bunk.\n\nOld Taoist also bent down and fumbled around below him. He didn't know what his boss was looking for, but it didn't matter, just search!\n\nAfter all, most bosses don't see your progress, but your attitude.\n\nUnder the bed were some miscellaneous items. After pulling them out, it was empty underneath, as no one lived in this dorm room anymore.\n\nZhou Ze opened the wardrobe. All eight compartments were open, and there was nothing inside except a thin layer of dust.\n\nOld Taoist scratched his head and simply climbed to the upper bunk. On the wall by the upper bunk, there were many posters of football stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Ramos.\n\nZhou Ze also came to the upper bunk. He felt there should be something here, otherwise Wang Baogang's ghost wouldn't have lingered, and he himself had also seen other strange scenes in this dorm.\n\nIf nothing else, this dorm room should be the key point of this series of events.\n\n「Boss, what kind of painting is on that poster over there? It looks weird,」 Old Taoist said, pointing to Zhou Ze's side.\n\n「A Picasso painting,」 Zhou Ze replied.\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze seemed to discover something and reached out to touch the poster.\n\nFrom Old Taoist's perspective, his own boss was actually reaching out to touch the chest of the woman in the painting. Old Taoist immediately blurted out:\n\n「Boss, go home and touch Yingying's! The woman in this painting is too ugly...」\n\nOld Taoist hadn't even finished speaking when,\n\nA 「rip」 sound was heard,\n\nThe painting was directly torn down by Zhou Ze, and several pieces of paper fell out from between the painting and the wall.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother with Old Taoist's nonsense. He picked up a piece of paper directly. It was a pen drawing, with very precise artistry. The drawing depicted a dorm room, but this dorm room was covered and filled with a special liquid.\n\nIt could be considered water, or it could be... blood.\n\nThe next drawing showed a boy with only half a body struggling to crawl inside on the balcony, and two legs extended from inside the dorm's wardrobe.\n\nNext was the third drawing, which showed a man standing on his head, inverted on the tiles with his hands supporting him, wearing leather shoes.\n\nThree drawings, representing three scenes, and Zhou Ze had just witnessed all three of these scenes.\n\nOne was the dorm room filled with blood, one was the half-bodied boy, and the other was Wang Baogang walking upside down.\n\nBelow, there were three more drawings, making a total of six.\n\nPicking up another drawing, it depicted a skeleton holding a book, walking among classmates and teachers. If nothing else, it should be Sun Qiu.\n\nNext was the fifth drawing. When Zhou Ze saw the scene in this drawing, he immediately turned his head to look at Old Taoist. Old Taoist had just climbed down from the opposite upper bunk and moved to Zhou Ze's upper bunk, seemingly very interested in what Zhou Ze had found.\n\n「What's drawn? Can't see clearly,」 Old Taoist asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed the drawing to Old Taoist. Old Taoist, holding the ladder with one hand, took the drawing with the other, then froze for a moment and fell directly down. Fortunately, it wasn't a high fall, so nothing serious happened, but Old Taoist seemed utterly disconsolate.\n\nThe drawing fell to the ground. In the drawing, an old man wearing a Taoist robe lay there, dismembered, with a black cat nearby seemingly gnawing at his corpse.\n\nZhou Ze flipped open the last drawing.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, the person in the last drawing wasn't himself, but the short-haired man. The short-haired man had a sharp object sticking out of his forehead, standing perfectly straight. Because the short-haired man had two moles on his face, it was easy to identify the person in the drawing.\n\nAfter finishing all the drawings, Zhou Ze looked at the disconsolate Old Taoist below and suddenly felt a sense of disappointment.\n\nWhy was there a drawing of Old Taoist but none of him?\n\nHmm,\n\nThis feeling was like a pre-determined protagonist in a movie having their scenes stolen by a background extra.\n\nOld Taoist immediately climbed back up, took the other drawings from Zhou Ze's hand, looked through them all, and then asked Zhou Ze timidly:\n\n「Boss, the drawings are all fake, fake, right?」\n\nZhou Ze got off the bunk, washed his hands at the sink, and said, 「Only the two drawings of you and the short-haired man I haven't seen. The other four drawings, I've seen them all.」\n\n「How is that possible? This isn't some Mayan prophecy! This humble Taoist is still alive, and that short-haired dorm supervisor is also alive!」\n\n「Are you saying that a few years ago, there was a middle school student with good drawing skills in this dorm who started worshiping you in advance?」 Zhou Ze countered.\n\n「This is a ghost's trick, a deliberate deception, trying to disrupt our morale!」\n\nZhou Ze said nothing more, but gestured for Old Taoist to put away all six drawings. Afterwards, Zhou Ze walked out onto the balcony.\n\nIt was almost dawn, and the morning light was faintly visible. People always liked to see dawn as a symbol of hope, but sometimes, it felt more like the oppression before darkness arrived.\n\nOld Taoist, with a bitter face, also walked to the edge of the balcony, took out a cigarette, offered one to Zhou Ze, lit one for himself, and then sighed, saying:\n\n「Boss, these are all fake, right?」\n\nOld Taoist had already asked this question before.\n\n「I don't know.」 Zhou Ze shook his head, then leaned against the edge of the balcony and continued, 「Do you feel that ever since we entered this dorm building, everything here has been very damp?\n\nAnd it carries a stale earthy smell?」\n\n「It's a dorm building, they're all like this,」 Old Taoist exhaled a smoke ring.\n\nZhou Ze reached up and rubbed his brow. At that moment, a bell rang in the dorm building, meaning students should wake up for morning self-study.\n\nSome more diligent students had already walked out from the ground floor exit when the bell rang. They were wearing red school uniforms.\n\nMeanwhile, students in the other surrounding buildings were wearing blue school uniforms.\n\n「School uniform colors, different.」\n\nZhou Ze pointed downwards. He didn't want to miss any detail now. The reason was simple: ever since he entered this dorm building, the successive events had left Zhou Ze completely clueless.\n\n「Probably middle school and high school uniforms are different. This is a middle school dorm building, and the two outside seem to be high school ones. This middle school has both middle school and high school sections together.」\n\nAs Old Taoist spoke, he took out that drawing again and looked at it. The more he looked, the more it didn't sit right. He even wondered why the person who died so miserably in the drawing wasn't Zhou Ze but himself?\n\nWhen did I get such a high level of presence?\n\n「Look, your short-haired man is out.」\n\nZhou Ze pointed downwards. The short-haired dorm supervisor walked out to the exit, holding a phone, seemingly making a call.\n\n「Didn't they call the police?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「They didn't, did they?」 Old Taoist asked, confused.\n\nActually, for Zhou Ze and Old Taoist, causing a little trouble wasn't a big deal; burning some paper money could usually handle it. The key was that even if that group of short-haired supervisors didn't call the police, they shouldn't have acted as if nothing happened.\n\nBefore, they were only focused on catching the ghost and overlooked this point, but now that they had leisure, they started to realize something was off.\n\nNo, to be precise, ever since they walked into this dorm building, hardly anything had been right.\n\n「Look, he's still alive too.」\n\nOld Taoist pointed at the short-haired man standing below.\n\nThis feeling,\n\nReally,\n\nHe's good,\n\nI'm good too.\n\n「Crack!」\n\nSuddenly, the sound of shattering glass came from the rooftop. Old Taoist felt a gust of wind brush past his face, and then heard a burst of noise and screams from below.\n\nThe short-haired man standing below was hit precisely by the glass.\n\nThat piece of glass,\n\nPierced directly into his forehead,\n\nPerfectly straight.\n---\n¹「The Great Leader」 (偉大領袖, *wěidà lǐngxiù*) refers to Mao Zedong. 「All reactionaries are paper tigers!」 (一切反動派都是紙老虎, *yīqiè fǎndòngpài dōu shì zhǐ lǎohǔ*) is a famous quote by Mao Zedong.",

    "content": "The bookstore in the early hours of the morning appeared quite deserted. Of course, with its exaggerated 100-yuan minimum charge sign, this bookstore was also destined to struggle to become lively.\n\nXu Qinglang was sleeping his beauty sleep in the upstairs bedroom, wearing a face mask. After bidding farewell to restaurant life and escaping the erosion of kitchen fumes on his skin, he began to increasingly appreciate and care for his skin.\n\nHeh, men,\n\nJust have to learn to be a little better to themselves, love themselves a little more.\n\nBai Yingying was sitting alone at the counter on the first floor, playing PUBG Mobile on her phone and having a great time.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open at this moment. Bai Yingying looked up and saw a small loli in a red outfit standing at the doorway. The loli's attire was truly festive and made her appear even more naive and cute.\n\nYawning, Bai Yingying continued to lower her head and look at her phone.\n\nThe loli walked up to the counter. She was a bit short and couldn't reach it, so she simply pushed open the small counter door and walked in, standing behind Bai Yingying and watching her play the game.\n\nWhen a game round ended, Bai Yingying stretched, glanced at the loli, put down her phone, and asked:\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nThe loli raised her delicate chin, sizing up Bai Yingying, while shaking her head and smiling slightly:\n\n\"Even your Madam didn't dare to speak to me in that tone when she first met me.\"\n\n\"You know that was 'back then'.\" Bai Yingying shrugged. \"What's the difference between you and me now?\"\n\nWe're all dogs, all leashed by one man.\n\nWhy the pot calling the kettle black?¹\n\nThe loli sat down on a chair to the side. This gave her a special sense of satisfaction. She had always been sensitive about her height and disliked standing below, looking up at people taller than her.\n\n\"Can you compare yourself to me?\" the loli retorted.\n\n\"Heh, I can even 'ying ying ying'², what can you do?\n\nYing ying ying...\"\n\nThe loli frowned slightly. She didn't know how to respond to that.\n\nAfter all, she was a two-hundred-year-old zombie.\n\nYet, she could genuinely 'ying ying ying' to serve that man without any sense of awkwardness.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Bai Yingying asked. \"Did your mom go to get her hair done again in the middle of the night and dump you at the bookstore?\"\n\nThe loli took an envelope out of her pocket and tossed it onto the counter. \"Everything he asked me to investigate is inside. The location of that Japanese priest has also been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you just call him?\" Bai Yingying tilted her head and asked. \"Oh, I get it. Do you think bringing it yourself shows more sincerity and lets you earn some goodwill with him?\"\n\nImmediately after, a sense of crisis appeared on Bai Yingying's face:\n\n\"Are you trying to... compete with me for his favor?\"\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nThe loli slammed her palm on the counter,\n\nscolding Bai Yingying:\n\n\"Don't think of me as being like you!\"\n\nBai Yingying pursed her lips and muttered, \"Kids just love their dignity.\"\n\nThe loli restrained her urge to fight Bai Yingying and said, \"I couldn't get through to his phone, couldn't reach him. I thought he was in the bookstore, but it turns out he's not.\"\n\n\"He went out for something,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"He's really busy.\"\n\n\"He's almost becoming a regular employee,\" Bai Yingying chuckled. It was clear she was genuinely happy for Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Why are you happy about him becoming a regular employee?\" The loli disliked Bai Yingying's 'ugly expression' the most, seeing her sweetly endure being enslaved and controlled.\n\nBecause she didn't want to become like this stupid zombie in front of her.\n\n\"Why, he's my boss. The better he does, aren't I also honored by association? Besides, the sooner he becomes a regular and gets promoted, won't you also gain your freedom sooner?\"\n\n\"Whether he does well or not really has nothing to do with you. You should think about how you're going to spend the next Cold Clothing Festival!³\"\n\nThe loli really couldn't stand Bai Yingying's 'silly sweet' mode anymore.\n\nAll that fake, beautiful, innocent freshness,\n\nMust be pricked with a silver needle,\n\nPrick, prick, prick!\n\nThe loli knew Bai Madam. Because of Bai Madam's special nature, the loli didn't make a move against her. Both sides kept to their own business.\n\nYou cultivate your merits, I do my performance, we leave each other in peace.\n\nHowever, the loli clearly knew what kind of person Bai Madam truly was. She could even guess Bai Madam's purpose in giving her corpse to Zhou Ze before her merits were complete and she descended into hell.\n\n\"How to spend it? Of course, I have designs!\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nBai Yingying opened her computer, clicked on a folder, and said:\n\n\"I designed for a long time, and I even designed many styles.\"\n\nThe loli saw various bamboo beds appear on the computer screen. There were bamboo beds in mandarin duck and butterfly patterns, small boat bamboo beds, princess beds, and various decorations hanging above them.\n\nThe loli was shocked.\n\nShe,\n\nalready knew?\n\n\"These bamboo beds aren't cheap to make, but luckily I still have enough burial items. I can sell two items then and still have them made. Don't you think, lying on these to be burned, wouldn't it be very beautiful?\"\n\nThe loli reached out and covered her face. She didn't know how to talk to this zombie anymore.\n\nThis wasn't foolishness.\n\nThis was having a screw loose!⁴\n\n\"You know that day will come, and you're still here working as his maid?\" the loli could only ask this in the end.\n\n\"I quite like my current life,\" Bai Yingying said, as if it were obvious. \"It's quite good.\"\n\n\"Do you think this will move him?\" the loli retorted.\n\nBai Yingying didn't answer.\n\n\"Last time, a single corpse demon brought him so much performance credit. A genuine two-hundred-year-old zombie, do you know how much performance credit that's worth?\"\n\nBai Yingying still didn't speak.\n\n\"Forget it.\" The loli didn't want to talk anymore. She looked at the envelope she had just tossed onto the counter, and asked, \"Where did he go?\"\n\n\"He seemed to have gone to some school,\" Bai Yingying said. \"He's just one ghost short, the boss is anxious.\"\n\n\"School?\" The loli shifted her body, not making a big deal of it. \"I'm leaving first. When he gets back, give him the envelope.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded to indicate she remembered.\n\nThe loli got off the chair, preparing to leave. Just as she reached the doorway, she inadvertently glanced at the young man sitting in the corner of the bookstore, reading a book.\n\nThe young man held a book in his hand, reading it engrossed, and occasionally snorting like a pig with laughter.\n\nThe loli stopped.\n\nWhen she came in,\n\nWhy hadn't she sensed another ghost in the bookstore?\n\nThis ghost,\n\nshe had seen with her eyes,\n\nrather than sensed.\n\nThe loli reached out and pointed at the young man, asking Bai Yingying, \"Who is he?\"\n\n\"A ghost. According to the boss, he's a highly intelligent retard. He walked into the bookstore by himself. And because his soul is incomplete, he can't be taken into hell, so he's staying here for now. Once the boss's affairs are settled, he'll be sent away.\"\n\n\"Incomplete soul?\"\n\nThe loli walked towards the young man who was reading. The young man completely ignored the loli's approach, fully immersed in the world of his novel.\n\n\"What's his name?\" the loli asked.\n\n\"Sun Qiu, a middle school student.\"\n\nThe loli reached out and took the book from his hands.\n\nSun Qiu was startled and said with some dissatisfaction, \"Little sister, what are you doing? Don't be naughty.\"\n\nSaying this, Sun Qiu reached out for the book again.\n\nHowever,\n\nin the next moment,\n\nThe loli suddenly stuck out her tongue. In an instant, her tongue lashed fiercely at Sun Qiu's soul like a whip.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nSun Qiu was whipped to the ground, crying out in pain continuously.\n\nFor a soul body, the loli's 'tongue skill' was absolutely terrifying.\n\nSeeing this, Bai Yingying immediately stepped out from behind the counter. \"Hey, what are you doing? That's the boss's reserved performance credit.\"\n\n\"Performance credit?\" The loli was somewhat baffled, even a little amused, pointing at Sun Qiu, who was on the ground, and said, \"Are everyone in your bookstore a bunch of fools?\n\nWhat kind of soul is this, what kind of ghost is this!\"\n\nZhou Ze had been in the ghost messenger circle for a considerable amount of time. Of course, he couldn't compare to the loli; she was a senior ghost messenger, naturally having experienced much more.\n\n\"He's not a ghost?\" Bai Yingying was stunned. If he's not a ghost, what is he?\n\n\"So, the reason he couldn't be sent to hell wasn't because his soul was incomplete, but because he wasn't a ghost at all. Of course, it would be impossible to send him below through the gate of hell.\"\n\nThe loli walked up to Sun Qiu, her tongue relentlessly lashing him. He screamed continuously.\n\n\"Look, his soul is just weak, but it's not dispersing. He's fundamentally a mass of illusory energy, not a soul body.\"\n\nThe loli said with great certainty.\n\n\"He's not a ghost, but he specifically came to the bookstore...\" Bai Yingying immediately thought of something, and her expression instantly changed.\n\nA guy who wasn't a ghost came to the bookstore and even told a ghost story?\n\nAnd the boss even took the old Taoist priest to the school?\n\n\"Tongcheng, has anyone new come recently?\" the loli asked.\n\n\"That person from Rongcheng has been here.\"\n\nHearing this, the loli's face revealed unconcealable terror. But she immediately suppressed it, and then asked, \"And who else?\"\n\nBai Yingying pondered. Then she suddenly remembered that little girl from Three Villages who said she came from there. And that little girl actually knocked her down and tied her up.\n\n\"It seems there really was one, very powerful, the kind that could knock me down in an instant. By the way, you still haven't said, how did this thing actually come into being?\"\n\nBai Yingying asked, pointing at Sun Qiu.\n\n\"Every Inspector, upon advancing to Judge of the Underworld, will be granted a Yin-Yang Brush by the Underworld Bureau, which can settle the universe and discern right from wrong. And a Yin-Yang Scroll, within which Yin and Yang are hidden.\n\nThis thing, it must have been born from within the Yin-Yang Scroll... a puppet.\"\n\nHaving said that,\n\nThe loli suddenly looked up and burst into laughter,\n\n\"Hahahahahahahaha...\"\n\nA small loli,\n\nwith her hands on her little waist,\n\nlaughing loudly.\n\nShe seemed to want to create a heroic aura, but in reality, her pose was as ridiculous as it could get, a cringeworthy and endearing level of chuunibyo⁵.\n\n\"So, the boss is in danger?\" Bai Yingying said.\n\nThe loli shrugged, then looked at Bai Yingying and said, \"Shouldn't we be happy? If someone schemes him to death, then both you and I will be free.\"\n\nYes,\n\nIf Zhou Ze were schemed to death,\n\nthen the loli could undo that night's surrender agreement and regain her freedom!\n\n\"Have you forgotten what kind of person the boss is?\" Bai Yingying suddenly asked.\n\n\"What?\" The loli was perplexed.\n\n\"If the boss knew he couldn't escape, that he was truly going to die... Given his personality, he might feel too lonely dying alone. Then, in the final moment before death, he would crush your soul blood and make you accompany him in death.\"\n\n\"............\" The loli.\n***\n¹ The pot calling the kettle black (五十步笑百步): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"fifty paces laughing at a hundred paces.\" It describes someone criticizing another for a fault that they themselves share, especially when their own fault is only slightly less severe.\n² Ying ying ying (嚶嚶嚶): An onomatopoeic term in Chinese internet slang, representing a cutesy, whiny, or fawning sound, often used to feign weakness or innocence.\n³ Cold Clothing Festival (寒衣節): A traditional Chinese festival on the first day of the tenth lunar month, when people offer \"winter clothes\" and other provisions to deceased ancestors and spirits by burning paper replicas.\n⁴ A screw loose (腦殼有包): A Chinese colloquialism literally meaning \"a bump on the head\" or \"a hole in the head.\" It's used to describe someone who is foolish, crazy, or not thinking straight.\n⁵ Chuunibyo (中二): A Japanese term, literally \"second-year middle school syndrome,\" referring to a phase in which adolescents have delusions of grandeur, believe they possess special powers, and act overly dramatic or rebellious.

    "content": "The Short-Haired Guy had glass shards stuck in his head, as if wearing a headdress, and blood slowly began to seep down.\n\nHe stood for several seconds, swayed for a few steps, and then, amidst the screams of the surrounding people, collapsed.\n\nZhou Ze had read memoirs from some Japanese war criminal soldiers, where someone had written that headless corpses seemed to twitch after decapitation, and even heads on the ground could move their eyes a few more times.\n\nPerhaps death came too suddenly, too swiftly; not only did the victim not have time to react, even the victim's body seemed unable to make a timely response.\n\nDownstairs in the dormitory building, it was already a chaotic mess.\n\nZhou Ze leaned on the railing with both hands, sighed, then looked at Old Tao.\n\nOld Tao was distraught at this moment, his face pale with fright.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"Sigh, see? A perfectly fine person, and you just jinxed him to death.\"¹\n\n\"............\" Old Tao.\n\nOld Tao felt wronged; he didn't want this either. He genuinely wished the Short-Haired Guy a long life, the kind who could go eighteen times a night and be strong as an ox.\n\nBut he died,\n\nDied so abruptly,\n\nSo then,\n\nOf the six drawings, only one remained.\n\nThere's a famous movie series called *Final Destination*. Old Tao now felt like a character in it, clearly told that he would die, and even how he would die.\n\nSeriously, it would be better to be struck suddenly, to die cleanly and painlessly.\n\nAt this moment, Old Tao truly envied that Short-Haired Guy. He was gone in an unexpected instant. Now, Old Tao had to endure the torment of not knowing when he would die.\n\nIt was simply... a life worse than death.\n\nLooking at his boss on the side, he was actually still smoking.\n\n\"Let's go down and see.\"\n\nZhou Ze said, and was the first to walk out of the dorm room. Old Tao naturally didn't dare to leave Zhou Ze at this point; he had already made up his mind that even if Zhou Ze went to the restroom, he would stick to him like glue.\n\nAt the main entrance of the dormitory building's first floor, a group of students surrounded the Short-Haired Guy's body, and several dorm supervisors were inside maintaining order.\n\nThis feeling was very strange, because at this time, 120 (ambulance) and 110 (police) should have been called. In fact, they had been called, and everything that needed to be done had been done. But it seemed that such a major incident as someone dying in broad daylight only disturbed a corner of this school.\n\nThe students ahead, those who should go to school went to school, those who should go to the cafeteria for breakfast went for breakfast, as if they didn't care about this matter at all.\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette, then looked up at the dormitory building.\n\nOld Tao stood trembling beside him, secretly glancing at the Short-Haired Guy's body before quickly averting his gaze. The thought of soon following in his footsteps filled Old Tao with immense torment.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the steps, like a bystander, continuing to observe everything around him.\n\n\"Boss, should we go back first?\" Old Tao suggested.\n\nHe didn't want to stay here anymore; he wanted to return to the bookstore. At least the bookstore could give him some sense of security.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Can't leave.\"\n\nIt wasn't an answer of \"won't go,\" but \"can't go.\"\n\nOld Tao froze for a moment; he vaguely sensed that something was wrong.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and walked back into the dorm room. He directly found a seat in the dorm supervisor's office, took their tea leaves, and brewed a cup of tea.\n\nOld Tao stood beside him, like a little quail.\n\nHe didn't know what Zhou Ze was planning, but it seemed his boss had somehow grasped some information. Although he didn't know if Zhou Ze was feigning composure or truly composed, it at least gave him a little more hope.\n\nThe students had all gone to school, and the dormitory building had become much quieter.\n\nNone of the dorm supervisors had returned either, not one to the office. Perhaps they were busy with the Short-Haired Guy's body.\n\nThe police hadn't come.\n\nNeither had the ambulance.\n\nAfter sitting for about half an hour and drinking two cups of tea, Zhou Ze walked out of the office.\n\nAt the entrance of each dorm room in the hallway, there was a row of thermos bottles. Students would take out their thermos bottles and place them outside before leaving their rooms for school in the morning, and then a dedicated auntie would come with a plastic hose to fill these thermos bottles with hot water.\n\nBecause this hot water passed through plastic hoses, it inevitably had a slight plastic taste. Students generally didn't drink it, only used it for washing clothes or soaking their feet.\n\nAt this moment, an auntie happened to come over with a plastic water hose, ready to dispense water. She slowly walked from one end of the corridor towards this end.\n\nZhou Ze stood there, unmoving. Old Tao stood beside Zhou Ze, while the auntie seemed to not see Zhou Ze at all, continuing to walk this way.\n\n\"Old Tao, don't you think it's a bit strange? There are too many odd things happening in this place,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"First, Sun Qiu died but continued to live by inertia, and no one even noticed the cadaveric spots on his body. Then there were accidents one after another, bizarre scenes one after another. Could this dormitory building be an extremely ominous place, rarely seen in a century, which allows for the birth of so many ghosts and strange entities? And why was there no activity before, but it suddenly erupted recently?\"\n\n\"Uh... Boss, what exactly do you mean?\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, thought, and said, \"I think we should go back.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nOld Tao was more than willing. Regardless of whether an accident would befall him, he preferred dying in the bookstore over dying here.\n\nThe two walked together towards the entrance of the dormitory building. Outside, the Short-Haired Guy's body had already been dealt with.\n\nZhou Ze stood on the steps at the entrance, not hurrying down, but watching Old Tao walk out step by step.\n\nWhen Old Tao was about to walk out of the dormitory building's perimeter,\n\nZhou Ze looked up,\n\nHe saw,\n\nThe building was bending,\n\nAs if it were about to collapse.\n\nOld Tao, however, was completely unaware, and continued on his way.\n\n\"Old Tao, don't move,\" Zhou Ze warned.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nOld Tao took another step out, then turned his head.\n\nIn an instant, blood surged out from a window of a dorm room above, sweeping towards Old Tao. This should have been the dorm room where Zhou Ze had been earlier and found the fountain pen drawings. It should have been on the third floor, but now, due to the bizarre bending of the entire building, the window of that dorm room was directly aimed at Old Tao.\n\nWhen the bloody water rushed over, Old Tao was completely engulfed.\n\n\"Sh*t...\"\n\nThese were the last words Old Tao had time to say,\n\nHe was practically collapsing,\n\nIt didn't matter how many ghosts showed up; he'd seen ghosts before.\n\nBut a building that could bend like it was pole dancing?\n\nWho'd ever seen that?\n\nYou motherf***er,\n\nYou can't play like this!\n\nZhou Ze turned around, looking at the woman behind him who was still pouring hot water into the thermos bottle.\n\nHowever, the hot water from the woman's bottle seemed as if it would never fill, continuously staying above the thermos bottle, with the sound of water constantly coming from within.\n\nFor anyone with life experience, when pouring hot water into a thermos bottle, the sound changes as the water level rises. But here, it remained unchanged.\n\n\"Hey, the thermos is leaking.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the thermos bottle, reminding the woman.\n\nThe woman paused slightly, turned her head, and looked at Zhou Ze. Her face was riddled with holes like a hornet's nest, as if covered in countless small, round, calloused growths, some areas involuntarily closing and expanding.\n\nA very disgusting sight,\n\nTruly disgusting.\n\nThe woman continued to hold the plastic water hose, while Old Tao struggled endlessly in the bloody water outside the dormitory building. Within the bloody water, several dark figures were vaguely visible, slowly approaching him, and in the hands of these dark figures were gleaming broadswords.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, preparing to take the hose from the woman's hand.\n\nA sinister smile appeared on the woman's face,\n\nThe hose directly twisted, coiling around Zhou Ze. The previously inanimate object now seemed to have become a living boa constrictor!\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew long,\n\nHe didn't resist the boa constrictor, letting it bind him. Zhou Ze could even clearly hear the crisp snapping of his own bones.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nIt was somewhat pleasant to the ear.\n\nIn the distance, at the end of the corridor, the boy with half a body began to crawl this way again, wriggling like a mad dog, roaring something.\n\nOn the other side, Sun Qiu, covered in cadaveric spots, also walked this way, staggering and bewildered.\n\nThe Short-Haired Guy also appeared, the glass still stuck in his head, blood flowing.\n\nEven the leather shoes Zhou Ze had destroyed had reappeared from who knows where, incessantly making a 'drip-drop' sound.\n\n\"Is the dagger revealed at the end of the map²? Is it because you know I've seen through you?\"\n\nZhou Ze murmured to himself.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nOld Tao had already sunk into the bloody water, with only occasional bubbles emerging from his nose; clearly, he couldn't hold on any longer.\n\nThose dark figures seemed to be approaching him, and within the bloody water, there was a small figure, not human, like a cat, waiting for its dinner.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails didn't sweep around,\n\nInstead, with a kind of boldness and resolve, he plunged them directly into his own chest, and stirred them around.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe pain was so clear; Zhou Ze's body even began to convulse because of it.\n\nBut at that very moment, the surrounding scene began to rapidly reverse: the woman retreated, the Short-Haired Guy's dorm supervisor retreated, the half-bodied boy retreated, the leather shoes began to retreat, and even the bending dormitory building began to straighten.\n\nEverything, everything seemed to be returning to normal.\n\nAs everything rapidly reversed,\n\nZhou Ze seemed to see a girl standing deep in the corridor, looking at him. The girl's appearance was somewhat familiar.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nA crisp sound echoed,\n\nThe sound of a book being closed.\n\n\"Thud... Whoosh whoosh whoosh... Cough cough...\"\n\nOld Tao lay on the grass, gasping for air and coughing violently, his hands clutching his neck tightly. After a while, he slowly calmed down, then looked around in confusion.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze standing nearby, holding a closed notebook.\n\nThe crisp sound heard earlier was from Zhou Ze closing the notebook.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, still feeling a lingering pain in his chest.\n\n\"Boss... what happened?\" Old Tao thought he was about to die just now, but how did things suddenly take such a turn?\n\n\"You can think carefully about how we got in,\" Zhou Ze slowly said.\n\n\"We drove here. I tricked the security guard at the school gate to get in. Then we got out of the car, walked to the residential area, found Building B, then we secretly went inside, saw Sun Qiu, and then even fought with a dorm supervisor...\"\n\n\"Think again, carefully,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Think carefully?\" Old Tao scratched his head, then a look of shock appeared on his face. \"I... I... We did drive in, that's right. But as soon as we got out of the car, we seemed to see a black cat. That black cat was staring at us from the grass, and I even said we should catch it and keep it as a pet. Then we walked to the grass, found the black cat was gone, but there was a notebook on the ground. Boss, you picked up the notebook, and I even asked you if it was writing or drawing inside... Then... then we just...\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the slightly worn notebook in his hand,\n\nHe dared not open any page of it again.\n\n\"Boss, where's that dormitory building?\" Old Tao looked around, realizing something was missing.\n\n\"Look at the other dormitory buildings nearby. How are they marked?\"\n\n\"Building 1, Building 2, Building 3...\" Old Tao counted, then he slowly stopped counting. Here, the dormitory buildings were named using Arabic numerals to differentiate them; there was no naming convention using English letters at all!\n\n\"Boss... where's Building B, then?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the notebook in his hand,\n\n\"Building B,\n\nIs in here,\n\nDrawn.\"\n---\n¹ *Jinxed him to death*: A sarcastic expression implying that one's words or actions (often well-meaning) inadvertently caused a negative outcome, as if jinxing someone.\n² *Is the dagger revealed at the end of the map?*: An idiom meaning that a hidden agenda or sinister motive is finally exposed.",

    "content": "It was almost dawn, which meant Zhou Ze and the Old Taoist had been standing motionless on this lawn, maintaining that posture for a very long time.\n\nFortunately, at this time, there was almost no one walking around the dormitory building, so no one noticed two people foolishly standing there stiffly.\n\nOtherwise, if anything unexpected had happened, they wouldn't have been able to react, just as Iron Crutch Li possessed a dead beggar because his physical body encountered an accident while his spirit was wandering.\n\nThe Old Taoist sat into the car, took out the medicated wine from inside, and rubbed his knees. At this moment, he was a bit disoriented. The previous illusion and the current reality, two indistinguishable feelings of true and false, kept assailing him, and he didn't even know which part was truly sore and which part was falsely aching.\n\nIt was like when a person has just gotten out of the water after swimming and always feels a bit unaccustomed to gravity.\n\nZhou Ze also sat into the front passenger seat. In front of him, lay that notebook.\n\nThe notebook cover was blue, very low-key, and very ordinary.\n\n\"Boss, what exactly is going on? How can looking at a notebook turn into that?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist had always been very curious about this. For some unknown reason, a part of his and the boss's memory after entering the school was erased, and then they directly entered Building B.\n\nAnd in fact,\n\nBuilding B did not exist,\n\nnor did the dormitory supervisor inside, the boy with half a body, Zhao Baogang walking upside down, the auntie filling hot water bottles, and so on. None of them actually existed.\n\nBut that feeling, though non-existent, was extremely real, and the subconscious \"seamless transition\" inertia it created, this was truly terrifying.\n\n\"Heard of *Painted Wall*?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The movie, I've seen it,\" the Old Taoist replied.\n\n\"It's a story from *Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio*.\" Zhou Ze tilted his head against the backrest. \"It's pretty much the same thing, but in that story, people entered the world of the wall painting, while this time, we entered the world inside this notebook. If I'm not mistaken, the notebook should contain some pen-and-ink drawings. Everything we saw in that dormitory building was drawn inside it.\"\n\n\"That exaggerated?\"\n\n\"Now there's only one problem left: what kind of ghost is that Sun Qiu.\"\n\nIf Zhou Ze still hadn't realized Sun Qiu's issue by this point, then he would have truly wasted his time.\n\nFrom that guy entering the bookstore and telling the story, to him and the Old Taoist entering Pingchao Middle School, being guided by a black cat to find this notebook, the entire matter was actually interconnected.\n\nSomeone was guiding and manipulating from behind the scenes, seemingly waiting for all of this to come to fruition.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable. Normal people don't like to be someone else's puppet.\n\nAnd the scene of the girl deep in the corridor that he saw when he \"closed\" the notebook reminded him again of that little girl from Sanxiang Village. She was naive and charming, she was very hungry, and she was also very well-behaved.\n\nBai Yingying was directly thrown down by the other party and tied up.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had thought the other party was some elusive expert, doing good deeds without leaving a name, but who knew, she wasn't actually that simple.\n\nZhou Ze could actually guess the purpose of the six pen-and-ink drawings found in the dormitory building, especially the one about the Old Taoist.\n\nPaintings, like movies, are all fake, and not strictly speaking, real existences. The scenes and characters within the paintings can naturally be unconstrained.\n\nFor example, the dormitory building could bend, and the ghosts appearing one after another inside could appear without any logic or reason, but fakes are fakes after all, how can they become real?\n\nLetting a living person die inside it, letting a real living person die in a fake world, from a single point to a broader scope, this can give something originally fake the ability to influence reality.\n\nJust like some investment scams, their gimmicks and all their promotions are basically fake, but they can attract investment and swindle massive amounts of money in reality. In the end, whether it's real or fake no longer matters; it has successfully stirred up trouble in reality.\n\nAnd because he himself was already a \"dead person,\" not a living person, the protagonist of that painting became the Old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed his forehead. Honestly, this matter lacked a clear beginning or end, and moreover, the feeling of being watched and plotted against was uncomfortable.\n\n\"Meow!\"\n\nA cat's meow came, and the Old Taoist, who was sitting in the driver's seat rubbing medicated wine, suddenly stiffened, quickly looking out the window. On a pedestrian bridge not far away, a black cat was crouched there, its eyes like sapphires, watching this side.\n\n\"Dang it, this cat ran out again.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist was quite sensitive to cats. He now recalled that the reason he suggested catching that black cat back then was also because his previous boss had a white cat, and he thought if Zhou Ze had a black cat by his side, it could effectively elevate his aura.\n\nZhou Ze got out of the car and looked over there, still holding that notebook in his hand. On the back of the notebook, there was a sticker, a black cat's head.\n\nThe black cat was nearly a hundred meters away from Zhou Ze. It licked its paw, seemingly still unsatisfied; just now, it was really only a little bit away from feasting on the Old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze didn't run over to catch the cat, nor was he bothered to play hide-and-seek with it. He took out a lighter, lit a flame, and brought the bottom edge of the notebook close to it.\n\n\"Screw your schemes,\"\n\n\"I'll just burn it down!\"\n\nThe black cat was stunned for a moment. It seemed it hadn't expected Zhou Ze to have such a reaction. Its body tensed immediately, and then it directly leaped over. The black figure almost flew across the concrete road, pouncing towards Zhou Ze.\n\nAs expected,\n\nWas this black cat similar to the spirit of this notebook?\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nZhou Ze's left fingernails grew long, and he directly clawed at the black cat pouncing towards him.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nThe black cat was directly sent flying by Zhou Ze, falling to the ground. Its body began to become ethereal, appearing very uncomfortable. It was much, much weaker than Zhou Ze had expected.\n\n\"Hey, are you really going to burn it?\"\n\nA girl's voice came from behind Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl sitting on top of his car, swinging her legs, as if watching a show.\n\nShe was indeed watching a show, from beginning to end, she had been watching.\n\nThe Old Taoist stuck his head out of the car. Before he could look up, a foot directly stepped on him.\n\n\"Ah, that hurts!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist was in so much pain that he pulled his head back in.\n\nThe Old Taoist really brought it upon himself. The girl was sitting on the car with her legs swinging; if you stuck your head out and looked up, wouldn't you see everything?\n\n\"Who exactly are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I'm just passing by, and I'm about to leave Tongcheng. I just want to remind you that this notebook is much more valuable than you imagine. It's currently just polluted. By a strange twist of fate, it was picked up by a student who could draw, and then so many ghost stories about the dormitory were drawn on it.\n\nCoupled with being tainted by the resentment and negative emotions of the students in this school, that's why it became like that.\n\nBut its function is actually much more advanced than this. Its use is absolutely not limited to VR glasses.\"\n\n\"Why should I believe you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little girl jumped off the car and walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\nA half-smile on her face,\n\nher eyes like stars, she was simply like a completely different person from the naive and foolish little girl from Sanxiang Village who had previously walked into his bookstore.\n\n\"Hehe, this is really fun. Your current appearance is really fun.\"\n\nThe little girl reached out her hand, wanting to touch Zhou Ze's face.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly, but he neither resisted nor refused.\n\nHer palm was very icy and cold. Honestly, it wasn't very comfortable.\n\nThe little girl kept stroking, then lifted her head and let out a long breath. \"Do you know, this is a Judge's magic artifact, a damaged Yin-Yang Scroll.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating that he didn't know.\n\nHe was still a temporary worker.\n\nOnly after becoming a regular employee would he be considered a proper ghost messenger. Then he would have to slowly work his way up to captain, followed by inspector, and only after that, a Judge.\n\nIt could be said that the level of \"Judge\" now was too distant for Zhou Ze.\n\n\"If I hadn't isolated the influence of this scroll, and only confined it to one dormitory building, tell me, how long would it have taken you to realize that what you were looking at was actually a painting? That the place you were in was actually fake?\"\n\nThe little girl seemed to be talking to herself.\n\n\"I'm leaving. That ring from last time and this notebook now, consider them gifts I'm leaving for you. Keep them safe; you should find them useful in the future.\"\n\nThe little girl reached out and grabbed forward. The black cat that had just been sent flying by Zhou Ze turned into a black light and flew into the girl's palm. Then the little girl sent it into the notebook.\n\nAt the same time, Sun Qiu, who had been reading in the bookstore, instantly vanished. The book he had been holding fell to the ground.\n\n\"Keep it safe. This thing, though severely damaged now, is still somewhat useful. Later, you can even catch some ghosts and put them inside.\n\nFor example, seductive ghosts or something. Then when you want to, you can go in and take a look. The experience will absolutely crush current VR adult technology.\"\n\nThe little girl retracted her hand and looked at Zhou Ze carefully again.\n\n\"I'm going down now. It'll be hard to come up next time. You can try to be more low-key. Of course, there's no need to shortchange yourself. Forget it, you seemed to have gotten used to it after your last life anyway.\"\n\n\"You know me?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Hm? Do you still think the you from your past life is the real you?\" the little girl retorted.\n\n\"If you're going to talk about past lives or something, that's too cliché and melodramatic,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then let me tell you an even more melodramatic story. I do know the you from your past life.\" The little girl blinked, looking at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"And then, you raped me.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"How about that, melodramatic enough?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Were you that small back then too?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHe wanted to know if he had been such a beast in his past life.\n\nThe little girl bent over laughing,\n\nthen slowly began to grow up.\n\nA thin layer of black mist enveloped her,\n\nmaking her face unclear to see, but she indeed transformed into the appearance of an adult woman.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit more at ease.\n\nFortunately,\n\nnot that much of a beast.\n\nHowever,\n\nWhat Zhou Ze couldn't see was that the woman's face within the black mist was actually the face of a terrifyingly wrinkled old hag.\n\nThe old hag was wearing a dark gold robe and a coronet, exuding endless elegance and grace. It was just that her face was truly extremely ill-suited to her figure and temperament, as if an extremely perfect work of art had been forcefully ruined and twisted.\n\n\"I'll wait for you. I'll slowly wait for you, waiting for you to climb up step by step, until the day you return to the Underworld to be conferred, waiting for you to remember some things from your past life.\"\n\n\"Don't be like this. You're making me feel like I've walked onto the wrong set. We're not filming *Chinese Paladin*.\"\n\n\"At that time, I'll torture and kill you again, and personally cast you into the path of beasts, only then will I feel the pleasure of revenge.\n\nYou're growing too slowly, so slowly that I can't stand it anymore. I had no choice but to appear and give you some good things, so you can fatten up quickly.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nHe suddenly felt that it would be better to have actually walked onto the wrong set than this.\n\n\"Hahahaha............\"\n\nThe woman's figure and the surrounding black mist dissipated in an instant, sinking into the ground.\n\nShe left,\n\nvery decisively.\n\nThe car door opened, and the Old Taoist, with a clear footprint on his face, rubbed his face as he walked out.\n\nTowards the spot where the woman vanished, he grunted discontentedly:\n\n\"Hmph, women.\"",

    "content": "On the way back, Zhou Ze was driving; Old Dao, in his current state, wasn't suitable for driving anymore.\n\n\"Boss, is that woman really your karmic debt from a past life?\"\n\n\"What did you hear?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uh, don't worry, Boss, I'll keep your secret!\" Old Dao immediately patted his scrawny chest.\n\n\"Dead men keep secrets best.\"\n\n\"............\" Old Dao.\n\n\"Screech............\"\n\nThe car came to a sudden halt.\n\nOld Dao was startled.\n\nHoly crap,\n\nIs he really going to kill me to silence me?\n\nZhou Ze habitually reached for a cigarette, but found he was out. He looked at Old Dao, intending to ask him for one, only to find Old Dao clutching his own knees, trembling there.\n\nReally scared?\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Old Dao's shoulder,\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nOld Dao cried out, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze found it a little funny; was his usual image really that bad, that Old Dao would actually think he'd kill him to silence him?\n\n\"Give me a cigarette.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nOld Dao immediately took out a cigarette, handed it to Zhou Ze, and then personally lit it for Zhou Ze, cautiously and carefully like an ancient maidservant, except this maidservant was a bit too old.\n\n\"Boss, what did you stop the car for?\"\n\n\"Stop pretending. Is putting on an act that much fun?\"\n\n\"Uh............\"\n\nOld Dao rolled his eyes internally, *Is it easy for me to serve a heartless and ungrateful jerk like you!*\n\nSometimes Old Dao couldn't understand himself; instead of living a carefree life, why did he always have to deal with a ghost boss? But thinking about it, he felt resigned; perhaps this was life,\n\nPerhaps,\n\nThis was what it meant to be a man.\n\nIf you weren't so bored you had to seek out some excitement and challenges, how boring would life be?\n\nMoreover, this current life was something his former self couldn't have accessed, and most ordinary people couldn't access it either.\n\n\"Boss, what did you stop for?\" Old Dao finally asked.\n\n\"To eat breakfast.\"\n\nZhou Ze finished speaking, pushed open the car door, and got out.\n\nEat breakfast?\n\nBoss, did you bring any money? I didn't.\n\nAhead was a row of breakfast stalls, with vendors selling jianbing, some serving noodles, and others selling steamed buns and fried dough sticks. This was a small traffic intersection, with many vehicles coming and going, and many people drove here to park and grab a bite.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to a vendor selling meat soup. The vendor was a middle-aged man.\n\n\"Two bowls of beef soup,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright! Chili?\"\n\n\"Add it.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe vendor first took out two bowls, put green onions and cilantro into them sequentially, then added some beef;\n\nAfterwards, he scooped a ladle of soup from the constantly coal-fired pot and poured it in, then poured the soup from the bowls back in, then immediately added various seasonings to the bowls, finally filling them with soup, and placed the two bowls for Zhou Ze on a small table to the side.\n\nZhou Ze took the chili and added more to his own bowl, then asked for two flatbreads, and sat down.\n\nOld Dao arrived at this moment. He sat beside Zhou Ze, rubbed his hands, feeling a bit restrained and also a little overwhelmed by the unexpected favor. Damn it, this was the boss's first time treating!\n\nThis stingy person actually treated!\n\nShould I cry a little to set the mood?\n\nOld Dao kept engaging in self-sabotaging mental activity, then saw Zhou Ze slowly and methodically tear the flatbread into pieces and put them into the soup bowl to soak.\n\nOld Dao followed suit. Old Dao had traveled extensively throughout his life, visiting countless places, so he was naturally no stranger to such breakfast foods. The vendor's accent when greeting customers immediately revealed he was from Henan.\n\nAnd for many Henan people, their morning actually begins with a bowl of soup.\n\nHowever, Old Dao didn't drink, nor did he move, just silently watched Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit uncomfortable under his gaze. He said, \"What's wrong? Can't you get used to it?\"\n\n\"No, no, no, I can get used to it, I can get used to it.\"\n\nOld Dao replied perfunctorily, humoring him.\n\nThis soup,\n\nDefinitely has something wrong with it!\n\nSuddenly stopping the car and getting out to eat breakfast was already suspicious, and he even so seriously tore the flatbread, doing it so formally.\n\nOld Dao turned his head and again sized up the vendor.\n\nIs this vendor a ghost?\n\nThen this soup is definitely not clean!\n\nOld Dao felt he had seen through everything. Goddammit, the boss was being mischievous again, just like before in the dorm building when he told me to go first, then watched from the side, watching the dorm building bend.\n\nThis time he's definitely messing with me again!\n\nWaiting for me to drink this soup, and then make a fool of myself!\n\n\"It's a bit hot, I'll drink it later,\" Old Dao explained.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, continuing to tear the flatbread in his hand.\n\nOld Dao was actually a bit hungry. He glanced at the vendor again, stood up, and said, \"Boss, this isn't enough, I'll go buy a couple of steamed buns from across the street.\"\n\nSaying this, Old Dao ran across the small road and bought back a few plain steamed buns. He sat back down, picked up a bun and started gnawing on it, eating it with great relish.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThings I bought myself are reassuring to eat, and they just taste good!\n\nAnd the big sister selling steamed buns, the steamed buns on her chest were also very big.\n\nAs Old Dao ate, he handed another steamed bun to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the steamed bun, placed it beside the soup bowl, then looked at Old Dao with a knowing smile.\n\nHuh,\n\nWhy is he looking at me with that look?\n\nOld Dao began to mutter to himself again.\n\nNo way,\n\nI didn't fall into your trap, didn't drink this soup, and you're unhappy?\n\nHow can you be like this!\n\nThen should I drink a little?\n\nOld Dao thought as he chewed his bun, it really was like accompanying a king was like accompanying a tiger*; none of these ghost bigshots were easy to deal with.\n\nIt's just that this bowl of seemingly fragrant soup in front of him, who knew what was actually inside? If it was something like roasted centipedes or roasted rats, it wasn't like he couldn't eat it, but the fear of the unknown, not knowing what the hell it was, was truly terrifying.\n\n\"Boss, eat! This bun is really delicious,\" Old Dao chuckled.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the bun he had just placed on the table and said, \"The table isn't clean, the bun's dirty.\"\n\n\"Then I'll eat this one. I'm not particular, don't waste it.\"\n\nOld Dao took the bun from Zhou Ze's hand, and started gnawing on it again. Anyway, he wasn't planning on drinking this meat soup!\n\nAt worst, he'd find another excuse, say he was full from the buns, and couldn't drink anymore.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Old Dao and shook his head.\n\nHeh,\n\nDisappointed, aren't you?\n\nDidn't succeed, did you?\n\nI'm smart, right?\n\nYou're helpless, aren't you?\n\nOld Dao felt smug.\n\nThen, Old Dao saw Zhou Ze lower his head, pick up the soup bowl, take a sip of soup, then take his chopsticks, pick out a piece of meat, and put it into his mouth to chew.\n\nIt could be seen that, even though a lot of chili had been added and the taste was strong, Zhou Ze still found it very difficult to eat and swallowed with much difficulty. This was consistent with Zhou Ze's usual eating habits.\n\nIt's just that, what surprised Old Dao was, the boss actually drank the soup?\n\nCould it be that he had overthought it?\n\nThis soup was fine?\n\nOld Dao didn't believe that Zhou Ze would sacrifice himself just to trick him.\n\nWas I being overly paranoid*?\n\nOld Dao watched Zhou Ze continue to drink the soup and eat the flatbread with immense difficulty, and finally confirmed: this soup was fine, he had just been overthinking things!\n\nAt once, Old Dao also immediately lowered his head and took a sip of soup.\n\nHmm, very authentic, the taste was great, really good, really good.\n\nDamn it, I almost choked on the bun just now.\n\nOld Dao ate heartily, eating with great relish. Even in cities in Henan, it wasn't easy to find an authentic soup shop, and to drink an authentic-tasting one in Tongcheng, especially from a roadside stall, was even more to be cherished.\n\nWith the soup, Old Dao finished both the steamed buns and the flatbread. He even asked for a refill of soup in the middle. Hmm, soup refills were free, authentic.\n\nZhou Ze ate one-third, couldn't eat anymore, put down his chopsticks, and sat there.\n\nAfter Old Dao finished eating, he patted his belly, feeling he hadn't had enough. Had he really not gotten full?\n\nAs he was thinking whether to have another bowl, Zhou Ze made to take out his wallet.\n\nOld Dao understood immediately and promptly stood up to pay the bill. He still had that much situational awareness.\n\nStanding up, Old Dao took the car keys from the table first and said, \"Boss, I'll drive back, you must be tired.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"It's not easy for you either, I'll do it.\"\n\nThe boss had changed,\n\nReally changed!\n\nNot only did he treat his subordinates to breakfast and soup, he also knew how to be considerate to them now!\n\nAs Old Dao hesitated, wondering whether to dab some tears to express his loyalty and further elevate the mood, Zhou Ze walked towards the other side of the road. Old Dao naturally followed along, and then, Old Dao saw Zhou Ze stop in front of the steamed bun stall where he had just bought buns.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nI told you the steamed buns of this stall's proprietress were very big, right? Boss, you're such a prude, Yingying's aren't small either, can't you look whenever you want?\n\nHa, men,\n\nthe grass is always greener on the other side.*\n\nOld Dao was having a flurry of internal thoughts. He felt that ever since the boss had contact with that person from his past life, the boss seemed to have changed, becoming more down-to-earth.\n\n\"Boss, what filling do you want for your bun? Or plain ones?\" the proprietress asked enthusiastically.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and pointed at the proprietress.\n\n\"Damn it, you beast! We were just looking, and you actually started flirting. Do you want to buy the proprietress's buns?\"\n\nOld Dao watched excitedly from the side as the boss hit on the woman,\n\n\"Huh, wasn't it rumored that the boss couldn't get it up?\"\n\n\"Boss, what do you want?\" the proprietress asked.\n\n\"You, come with me, go to where you should be,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nOld Dao froze,\n\nDarn,\n\nOld Dao had an ominous feeling!\n\nNo way?\n\nIt can't be?\n\nSurely not?\n\nImpossible, right?\n\nThe proprietress pressed her lips together. Her voice suddenly became a little lower, and she said, \"I died early from illness. My wife is raising three children alone, working two jobs a day, and still has to come out and sell breakfast. It's too hard on her.\n\nThat's why I thought of possessing her in the mornings, so she could rest a bit more.\"\n\nThe voice was still a woman's voice, but it had clearly changed to another person's tone, likely her husband's.\n\n\"Everyone is pitiable, so stop trying to gain sympathy. Your possession of your wife's body greatly diminishes your wife's lifespan.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze opened the steamer, took out a steamed bun from inside, and lightly pressed his thumbnail into it,\n\n\"Moreover, selling this kind of bun to cheat money from the living world, even if it's for your children's tuition, aren't you afraid of harming their karmic merit*?\"\n\nThe steamed bun in Zhou Ze's hand slowly began to change.\n\nIt turned into a paper-mâché bun-shaped object, with the filling inside actually a messy lump of paste, and it had all turned black.\n\nOld Dao, who was standing beside, immediately started vomiting:\n\n\"Blech!\"\n\n---\n*Footnotes:\n* \"accompanying a king was like accompanying a tiger\": An idiom meaning it is dangerous to be near powerful people.\n* \"Was I being overly paranoid?\": Literally \"Was I seeing every bush and tree as an enemy soldier?\", an idiom meaning to be overly suspicious or paranoid.\n* \"the grass is always greener on the other side\": Literally \"the flower at home is never as fragrant as the wild flower,\" an idiom often used in the context of men desiring extramarital affairs or what they don't have.\n* \"karmic merit\": Literally \"yin de,\" referring to invisible virtue or karma earned through good deeds.",

    "content": "The Old Daoist was vomiting uncontrollably beside them, everything he had just eaten came back up, a truly miserable sight. On the ground was a puddle of red, white, and yellow, multi-colored, like a condiment shop had opened.\n\nTears welled up in his eyes. The Old Daoist's heart was filled with regret and hatred. How could he be so unlucky?\n\nWith utmost caution and prudence, he thought he had jumped out of one pit, but unexpectedly, he foolishly threw caution to the wind and jumped into an even bigger, deeper pit.\n\nWhile jumping, he was even shouting:\n\n\"So floaty!\"\n\n\"Leave her body and come with me.\"\n\nZhou Ze urged. He was just one short. Once he sent this one back to hell, he could become a full-time employee.\n\nPerhaps this was a case of \"searching high and low only to find it effortlessly.\"¹ He had been busy going around in circles at the school, even encountering so-called karmic debts from a past life, yet he hadn't caught a single genuine ghost. Then, on the way back, he found him (her).\n\nThe woman hung her head, dejected, as if she had resigned herself to fate, but she still spoke:\n\n\"I want to accompany her a bit longer. She's willing, too. We can still meet every night in our dreams, and I can also see my three children.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained indifferent. Every deceased person has their own attachment to the living world; this is a characteristic of any intelligent life. A primal instinct for survival always compels them to seize any opportunity to linger.\n\nEven Zhou Ze himself was the same, but while he understood, rules were still rules.\n\nMoreover, this husband's restless spirit had been lingering on the woman. The woman's body would soon be unable to bear it and would develop problems. Ultimately, it would only be harming both herself and others.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe woman suddenly pushed away the stall in front of her, sending all the steaming baskets tumbling towards Zhou Ze. Then she immediately turned and began to flee. She wanted to escape; she didn't want to be caught.\n\nZhou Ze pushed away the steaming baskets in front of him. With his fingertip, he lightly swiped forward, releasing a black mist invisible to ordinary people, which directly entangled the woman.\n\nThe woman let out a muffled groan and fell to the ground.\n\nZhou Ze took a few steps forward, came to stand in front of the woman, and squatted down. He extended his hand and placed it on the woman's forehead. Immediately after, a wisp of black spirit was pulled out by Zhou Ze.\n\nThis was a man's face. The man struggled non-stop and roared angrily, filled with intense unwillingness and hysteria.\n\n\"She's willing! She wants to continue to be with me! She told me in her dreams at night that we would raise the children together! She's willing!\"\n\nThe man was arguing for himself, then glared angrily at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"She's willing, what right do you have to meddle?!\"\n\n\"I need performance.\"\n\n\"...\" the man.\n\nZhou Ze was being honest. Ultimately, he needed performance, and now he was only one short. He had also waited for several days, so he could only take him back to complete his mission and become a full-time employee.\n\nThe man was stunned for a moment. Zhou Ze's straightforward admission that it was for his own gain made him unable to refute, because he knew that no matter how much he argued or debated, it wouldn't soften the other party's heart.\n\n\"Let me go home and see my three children again.\"\n\nThe man pleaded,\n\n\"This time, I promise not to leave or escape.\"\n\n\"You are not qualified to negotiate with me, and I'm not putting on a show.\"\n\n\"At my home... there's still... a ghost!\"\n\n\"Alright then, letting you go home to see them again before you leave is reasonable. There's human sentiment beyond the law, right?\"\n\nThe Old Daoist, who had just finished vomiting beside them, heard this and suddenly wanted to vomit again.\n\nBut he held it in,\n\ndidn't dare.\n\nThe woman woke up, but was a bit groggy. The Old Daoist helped her walk back. Being possessed by a ghost, even if it was her own husband, caused significant harm to both body and mind.\n\nFollowing the male ghost's guidance, Zhou Ze began to walk towards his home.\n\nThe Old Daoist was a busybody. Although he had previously joked about her \"steamed buns\" being big, he wouldn't go so far as to take advantage of this opportunity to \"eat her tofu.\"² She was already pitiful enough, and he couldn't do such beastly things. So, he simply chatted with the male ghost:\n\n\"Brother, where are you from? Listening to your wife's accent, she's not local either.\"\n\nThe Tongcheng dialect is very easy to recognize, its distinctiveness is too high, because it's basically on a different frequency than Mandarin. While some local dialects sometimes sound too similar to Mandarin, so locals unconsciously carry a dialectal flavor when speaking Mandarin.\n\n\"Sichuan,\" the man answered.\n\nAt this point, he had also somewhat come to terms with it and felt some relief. The key was Zhou Ze's attitude, which was truly too different from those compassionate Daoists and monks he used to see on TV.\n\n\"Then how did you die?\" the Old Daoist asked again.\n\n\"Died comfortably.\"\n\n\"How did you die comfortably?\" the Old Daoist pressed on.\n\n\"Drug... overdose.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" The Old Daoist immediately became interested, asking like a curious baby, \"What does that stuff actually feel like? Is it really that great?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the Old Daoist. The Old Daoist stuck out his tongue, not daring to babble on anymore.\n\n\"Heh heh, of course it's very comfortable,\" the male ghost answered, \"so comfortable it feels like heaven and hell at once.\"³\n\n\"Comfortable enough to become a ghost, and your family fortune is also squandered?\" Zhou Ze said, twisting the knife.\n\nIn his previous life as a doctor, Zhou Ze was very clear about how terrifyingly harmful that stuff was to the human body. Ordinary people only knew that consuming that stuff was addictive and would squander money, but in reality, much of the damage that stuff did to the body was completely irreversible.\n\n\"Exactly, exactly, exactly! Look at the mess you've made of your life! Your wife is struggling so hard to raise the children, while you yourself died from pleasure.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist immediately grasped the spirit of Zhou Ze's conversation and began to echo him.\n\n\"Hmph,\" the man snorted. \"That stuff rich people here smoke is worthless! God knows how much miscellaneous crap is mixed in. Almost our entire village does this. If you buy it there, the purity is high and it's cheap.\n\n\"And, I relied on this to make money. I wanted to earn money for my family. Going and bringing it back once could earn a hundred thousand, worth ten years of hard labor in the fields. With the money I earned, I even opened a factory, started a workshop, and bought a large truck for transport.\"\n\n\"You're full of hot air! You earned so much money, how come your wife and children are so miserable now?\" The Old Daoist didn't believe him.\n\nThe male ghost seemed to get stubborn with the Old Daoist and said directly, \"Heh heh, if I'm lying, I'm a bastard. I used to be wealthy too, much wealthier than you imagine.\"\n\n\"After earning your first pot of gold, did you still continue to transport it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Of course I transported it, why wouldn't I? Could running a factory, opening a workshop, or doing transport make as much money as transporting this stuff? It's huge profits with little capital! Who would still open a broken factory that can't even break even in three years? It's truly meaningless to do that.\"\n\n\"Tsk tsk tsk.\" The Old Daoist clicked his tongue.\n\nActually, the Old Daoist had seen too many people like this.\n\nThis male ghost was probably once a poor farmer who, by transporting that stuff and taking risks, earned his first sum of money and then turned his life around, living a good life. But this taste of ultimate pleasure is truly hard to give up. If you asked him to open a factory, do real business, and live a good life, he couldn't anymore, because his values and financial outlook had completely collapsed.\n\nThis is similar to many prostitutes or gamblers. For a prostitute, she can easily earn tens of thousands a month. For a gambler, the next bet might be several thousand or tens of thousands. After their view on money is impacted by this, if you then let them \"go straight\" and work steadily in a factory earning three or four thousand a month, they themselves would find it meaningless.\n\nThen,\n\nthe person is wasted,\n\nit's difficult even if you want to start over and live a good life.\n\nWhy do so many people, after deciding to \"wash their hands in a golden basin\"⁴ and \"go ashore,\"⁵ soon go back down?\n\nThey simply couldn't stand living at the pace of a normal, ordinary person.\n\n\"Then, you, since you said the village there all does this, you should know that smoking that stuff is harmful, right? Why did you still smoke it?\" The Old Daoist asked somewhat confusedly.\n\n\"If the entire village smokes it, you'll feel like it's nothing. The environment is different,\" the man said with some melancholy. \"It's like if your dad, your uncle, your brother, your colleagues all smoke. Even if it says 'Smoking is harmful to health' on the cigarette pack, you'll still feel it's no big deal.\n\n\"Anyway, everyone is smoking.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist nodded thoughtfully.\n\nImmediately, the Old Daoist asked again: \"Then what about your money? Did you use it all up before you died?\"\n\n\"I left a lot of money,\" the man said. \"I didn't let my family down, I didn't let my wife and children down.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The Old Daoist chuckled.\n\nThis family lived in a garage apartment... in a small community. The ground floor was originally a garage, but it could be converted into a studio apartment for rent.\n\nThe woman was helped into the house. Inside were three children, all staring wide-eyed at Zhou Ze, the Old Daoist, and their mother.\n\nTwo boys and one girl, all probably elementary school age. One of them even had a red scarf tied around his neck.\n\nThe children's clothes were a bit old, but their faces were clean and their spirits seemed good. Although their living conditions weren't great, their mother must have taken good care of them.\n\nBut no matter how one looked at it, this family did not seem like the man claimed—that he had left a large sum of money after his death.\n\n\"Hey, didn't you earn a lot of money? How come your wife and children came all the way to Tongcheng and live here?\" the Old Daoist asked.\n\n\"She wanted to bring the children here. She didn't want to stay in the original village,\" the man replied.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze spoke: \"Where's the other ghost?\"\n\nBoss Zhou was always happy to have more performance; he truly had no interest in emotional columns or charity.\n\nThe male ghost's gaze shifted to a curtain in the corner.\n\nZhou Ze walked over.\n\nHe pulled back the curtain.\n\nBehind the curtain was a small plastic bathtub. Squatting inside was a very young-looking man, trembling. On his chest, there was a glaring, crimson flower-like mark.\n\n\"He's my son. After I died, he also got addicted using the money I left at home. Then the money ran out, and he followed my old path: 'sell to feed addiction.'\n\n\"He had bad luck and got caught.\n\n\"The amount was too large.\n\n\"He was sent to Rongcheng.\n\n\"And executed.\"\n\n---\n¹ **Searching high and low only to find it effortlessly (踏破铁鞋无觅处, 得来全不费工夫):** An idiom meaning that what you seek tirelessly appears when you least expect it, often when you've given up or are looking elsewhere.\n² **Eat her tofu (吃人家豆腐):** An idiom referring to flirting, making suggestive remarks, or physically harassing someone, especially a man towards a woman.

    "content": "\"So, don't you think this is retribution?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the man. Honestly, he felt no sympathy for this man, or even for his son, who had become a ghost but, like his father, still lingered in the human world.\n\nZhou Ze had no sympathy whatsoever.\n\nWhat people do, Heaven watches. Cause and effect cycle, retribution never fails.\n\n\"Retribution for what? I don't believe this is retribution. I trafficked the drugs myself, took the risks myself, earned the money myself. What retribution is there?\"\n\n\"How many people, because of the drugs you trafficked, had their families shattered, their wives and children separated? While they were indeed deplorable for going astray, you are also inseparable from a cardinal sin.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, and the Hell Gate opened.\n\nHonestly, there was nothing more to say to such people—oh no, such ghosts. He couldn't be bothered to say anything more.\n\nThe son's ghost was forcibly brought over by Zhou Ze. He tried to struggle but couldn't escape Zhou Ze's control, and was sent directly into the Hell Gate by Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to check his ID booklet. Instead, he casually grabbed the husband's ghost too. The husband's ghost seemed to accept his fate, offering no struggle, just staring coldly at Zhou Ze with a sneer.\n\n\"There are so many bad people in this world. Good people don't live long, while scourges last for a thousand years.\n\nHow many truly face retribution?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't argue. He grabbed him and sent him into the Hell Gate as well.\n\nEverything settled.\n\nZhou Ze opened his ID booklet. The word \"(Temporary)\" on his position had disappeared, replaced by \"Ghost Catcher.\"\n\nHe had become a permanent employee.\n\nHe was finally no longer a temporary worker with an uncertain future.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze felt the simple joy and pride of people from a decade or two ago, who, upon entering the system and securing a so-called \"iron rice bowl\"¹, felt they had reached the pinnacle of life, becoming someone above others.\n\nTurning to the next page, a verdict appeared:\n\nOriginally a traveler in the human world, coming vaguely, going vaguely;\nAlas, eyes blind, heart also blind, fortune cold, fate also cold;\nPlease, sir, do not amass ill-gotten gains, for family is gone, kin are gone;\n\nThe three lines of the verdict should summarize the husband's ghost's life. As for the son's ghost, who was shot, because Zhou Ze collected him first, he was counted as one who helped Zhou Ze achieve permanent status. Since Zhou Ze collected the ghost husband later, the first verdict after becoming permanent was the ghost husband's.\n\nThe meaning of the verdict was simple: originally, for this man, if nothing unexpected happened, he could have lived an ordinary life. But he was blinded by greed, exhausting all his already shallow good fortune, eventually not only losing everything but also implicating his children and relatives.\n\nStepping out of the home set up in the garage, Laodao felt a heaviness in his heart: this room full of children, and this woman who single-handedly brought three children to escape that drug-trafficking mountain village.\n\nAlas,\n\nHow pitiful,\n\nTruly pitiful.\n\nLaodao looked up and saw Zhou Ze stretching lazily in front of him, seeming to be in a very good mood, not feeling distressed or sad at all about this family's fate.\n\n\"Finally a permanent employee.\"\n\nZhou Ze murmured. He hadn't felt it before, but being stuck at 99% of the performance points for a while had really been agonizing.\n\nNow his performance sheet had refreshed, showing three per mille.\n\nThis meant that if he wanted to qualify as a bailiff, aside from finding a few more ghost catchers like Little Lolita to pledge allegiance to him as their bailiff, he still had a very long way to go in terms of performance alone.\n\n\"Boss, that family, they're really pitiful.\"\n\nAfter leaving the residential area, Laodao couldn't help but speak.\n\n\"Pitiful about what?\"\n\n\"That woman and those three children, their lives will be hard from now on.\"\n\n\"Why pity them? When they were prospering from crime, living the high life, they didn't think about ordering you Meituan Waimai².\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Laodao felt his boss's words made a lot of sense, but also no sense at all.\n\n\"When their family was well-off, the eldest son could freely take drugs, the younger children could wear new clothes, use more expensive toys, and go to better schools, and his wife could wear gold and silver.\n\nSince they enjoyed the good fortune together, they should also share the hardship when disaster strikes, isn't that the logic?\n\nMoney earned from drug trafficking, dirty money, depletes one's good fortune the most. You might enjoy it for a while, but you'll suffer retribution for a lifetime. This is fate, and it's self-inflicted. There's no need to pity them.\n\nI think you should pity yourself. You ate so many paper-filled buns, you'll be alright, right?\"\n\n\"Boss, don't mention that bun again—\"\n\nBefore Laodao could finish his sentence,\n\nhe suddenly let out an extremely foul-smelling fart,\n\nwinding and lingering,\n\nlike \"Reflections of the Moon on Erquan Pond\"³,\n\ncausing a person to feel heartbroken.\n\n\"Boss, wait, I need to find a place to relieve myself. I can't hold it in.\"\n\nLaodao said, and without time to find a toilet, he went straight for a nearby pile of grass.\n\nAfter a quarter of an hour, Laodao returned, his legs trembling. He was clearly close to collapsing from diarrhea. It was no wonder; he had eaten too many buns. Others who accidentally bought and ate those buns might also get an upset stomach, but Laodao had personally witnessed what the buns were made of. The double stimulation, both psychological and physiological, directly led to the current situation.\n\nThe two returned to the car. Just as Laodao was about to start driving, he immediately clutched his stomach, saying he couldn't, and had to go again.\n\nBy the time Laodao walked back, his face had turned pale.\n\n\"Damn it, they deserve it! That family truly deserves it!\"\n\nAfter such a miserable bout of diarrhea, Laodao had no sympathy for that family whatsoever.\n\nThis perfectly encapsulated the saying: most people's kindness is actually an emotion rooted in their own perspective.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the driver's seat. He didn't dare let Laodao drive; after all, Zhou Ze had died in a car accident last time he drove, and he didn't want to experience that again.\n\n\"I'll take you to the hospital.\"\n\nLaodao nodded. He absolutely had to go to the hospital, otherwise, his old life might be diarrheae'd away.\n\nThe morning sky had cleared up for a while, but soon it started raining again. The recent weather was indeed unpredictable, making it hard to fathom.\n\nZhou Ze drove the car into People's Hospital's parking lot, accompanying Laodao to register and see a doctor. He didn't know if Doctor Lin was there, nor did he plan to check.\n\nSince the matter with his sister-in-law, he hadn't contacted her again. He thought it best to just let this relationship end; it was hopelessly complicated, and all the back-and-forth was quite meaningless.\n\nLaodao took a glass cup to the restroom to collect a sample for testing. Zhou Ze sat on the long bench outside, taking out the notebook. He didn't dare open it, just fiddled with it in his hands.\n\nThe black cat design on the back of the notebook was much clearer than before, and when you looked at it, you had the feeling it was staring back at you.\n\nIn the hospital, people came and went. Not long after Zhou Ze held the notebook, a slight tremor would periodically emanate from it. It was very subtle, but clearly transmitted to Zhou Ze's mind through the touch of his fingers.\n\nZhou Ze noticed that his notebook only trembled slightly, and to varying degrees, when people in patient gowns or those being pushed in on stretchers passed by him.\n\nThis was a significant discovery. It seemed the notebook could predict the life and death of those around it. When people close to death or critically ill passed by, the trembling became more intense, serving as a reminder to its owner of who was about to kick the bucket.\n\nHis phone rang at that moment. Zhou Ze answered; it was Bai Yingying's call.\n\n\"Boss, are you alright?\" Bai Yingying asked anxiously from the other end of the line.\n\n\"Very good, what's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Xiaoke has found the Japanese priest's location. She's waiting for you at the bookstore, and she's very worried about your safety, terribly afraid something might happen to you.\"\n\nIn the bookstore, as she spoke these words, Bai Yingying deliberately glanced at Little Lolita sitting in front of her.\n\nLittle Lolita's cheeks puffed out in anger!\n\nShe was very angry. Even the densest person could tell Bai Yingying was badmouthing her to Zhou Ze!\n\nThus, women are natural palace infighters⁴. Even the seemingly naive Bai Yingying had managed to become a self-taught master, leaving others in the dust on the path of vying for favor.\n\n*Whine!*⁵\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze chuckled. He could, of course, understand the meaning behind Bai Yingying's words.\n\nLittle Lolita wanted him dead,\n\nthat was certain,\n\njust as he himself had once hoped Little Lolita would meet with an accident in Rongcheng and not return.\n\n\"I'll be back later. Laodao ate something bad, I'm with him at the hospital.\"\n\n\"Mm, alright, Boss. Love you, *whine, whine*.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Bai Yingying glanced at Little Lolita again, as if in defiance.\n\nLittle Lolita's cute nose tilted skyward, and she snorted,\n\n\"Hmph, childish.\"\n\n\"Wonder who's childish. I can bet you, if something really happens to the boss, he'll definitely take you down with him before he dies, but not me.\"\n\n\"...\" Lolita.\n\nSchemer!\n\nScheming zombie!\n\n\"Because someone always has to go to the boss's funeral,\" Bai Yingying said calmly. \"The boss said he doesn't want ordinary people to give him a funeral anymore. He doesn't want to experience being sent to the crematorium when he's clearly not dead again.\"\n\n...\n\nOn the hospital bench, Zhou Ze was boredly scrolling through Weibo when he discovered big news: in Yancheng, right next to Tongcheng, a natural disaster of tornado and hail had struck.\n\nThe geographic location of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is excellent. Historically, there have been few earthquakes or other natural disasters. Locally, at worst, there might be heavy rain causing waterlogging in farmlands. But this time, the tornado strike truly left everyone in the Jiangsu region somewhat at a loss.\n\nWhen Sichuan experienced earthquakes, many ordinary people in Rongcheng were accustomed to them. People could even orderly move tables and chairs out to open spaces without buildings and continue playing mahjong, waiting for the aftershocks to end.\n\nBut people from Jiangsu genuinely had little experience with such extreme natural disasters.\n\nSome doctors and nurses started rushing about, as if something had happened requiring an emergency assembly.\n\nDoctor Lin, in a white lab coat, also ran past Zhou Ze, then stopped and looked at Zhou Ze with some surprise:\n\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\nDoctor Lin was much thinner than before, and her clothes seemed a bit too large on her. A beauty's reduced figure is most distressing, making one unable to help but feel sympathetic.\n\n\"Accompanying a friend to see a doctor,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"A tornado struck the neighboring city, and there are many injured. Our hospital needs to organize medical personnel to go there for disaster relief. I'm leaving immediately.\n\nOh, and I've already signed and sent the divorce agreement to your bookstore, but you haven't sent it back.\"\n\n\"Oh, my bookstore moved,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Alright, we'll talk about this when I get back.\"\n\nDoctor Lin left in a hurry. The team over there had already assembled and was ready to depart.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up,\n\nhis expression somewhat grave.\n\nIt wasn't because Doctor Lin had brought up the divorce agreement during their first meeting in a while; in fact, it was a release for both parties.\n\nThe key was,\n\njust now, when Doctor Lin stood in front of him and spoke to him,\n\nthe notebook in his hand had trembled very violently.\n\nAfter Doctor Lin moved away, the notebook suddenly became quiet again.\n\nThis meant,\n\nshe was very likely to die soon!\n\n---\n¹ **Iron rice bowl (鐵飯碗):** A Chinese idiom referring to a stable job, typically in the public sector, that guarantees lifelong employment and benefits, making it highly desirable.\n² **Meituan Waimai (美團外賣):** A major Chinese online food delivery platform.

    "content": "The Old Daoist walked out of the restroom, carrying his \"secretion,\" ready to hand it over to the laboratory for testing. Zhou Ze looked at the Old Daoist and said:\n\n\"I have something urgent, so I'm leaving first. Can you handle it yourself?\"\n\n\"............\" The Old Daoist.\n\nAt the time when I most needed care, you...\n\n\"Do you want me to call Monkey to accompany you?\"\n\n\"............\" The Old Daoist.\n\nAre you sure you're not joking?\n\n\"That's it then, take good care of yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze, holding his car keys, walked out of the hospital.\n\nThe Old Daoist stood still and sighed, lamenting the difficulty of his life. Both his former bosses were a bit heartless and ungrateful, not even knowing the basics of how to treat people.\n\nBut on second thought, the Old Daoist felt relieved again.\n\nIt's precisely because they didn't know how to be proper humans that they all turned into ghosts.\n\nHeh heh.\n\nThe Old Daoist chuckled aloud and went to the laboratory himself. It must be said, an optimistic personality definitely played a significant role in being able to live to such an old age with a robust body.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked out of the main hall's entrance, he happened to see a minibus and three ambulances driving out. Immediately, he also went to the parking lot, got in his car, and followed them.\n\nHe didn't call Doctor Lin to tell her to get off and not go. He was also a doctor, clearly knowing that doctors indeed have a responsibility to step forward when facing such situations.\n\nWhen SARS ravaged more than ten years ago, many media reported that quite a few doctors and nurses in epidemic areas resigned or took leave, which also caused a public uproar. But in reality, more doctors and nurses continued to fight on the front lines, even getting infected with SARS themselves.\n\nZhou Ze's car followed closely behind the hospital vehicles, and then they all got onto the provincial highway.\n\nYancheng is really not far from Tongcheng. Moreover, the Yangtze River Delta region is all plains, and the transportation network is incredibly developed. So after a natural disaster struck Yancheng, rescue forces from various places could quickly arrive and provide support. The Wenchuan Earthquake back then actually suffered greatly due to transportation issues. After all, that area is mountainous, and the traffic conditions were truly worrying.\n\nIt was precisely after the Wenchuan Earthquake that the country has been investing heavily in recent years to reconstruct the transportation network in Sichuan. If another disaster occurs next time, there should be no need for the People's Liberation Army to parachute in at great risk to their lives.\n\nHalf an hour later, the highway started to get congested. The ambulances sounded their sirens and drove past using the emergency lane. Some unruly drivers who had occupied the emergency lane immediately moved aside after noticing the ambulances behind them, making the scene quite harmonious.\n\nZhou Ze, however, felt a bit awkward. As he followed the ambulances all the way, many nearby drivers gave him the middle finger for his shameless cutting-in behavior.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze wonder whether he should call Doctor Lin and just get on an ambulance to participate in the rescue directly. Anyway, Doctor Lin knew his medical skill level, but after thinking about it, he decided against it.\n\nLast night, first there was the school matter, then the breakfast stall matter, and then he successfully became a permanent employee. He hadn't slept for two days and was indeed too tired. This time, Zhou Ze only wanted to ensure Doctor Lin's safety. If he were to really participate in rescue work again, he'd be too tired; his body couldn't handle it.\n\nBesides, they weren't lacking one doctor anyway.\n\nIt must be said, his life as a bookstore owner since his \"borrowed corpse returns soul\"¹ had indeed changed Zhou Ze a lot; his originally diligent and conscientious personality had been worn down to be much lazier.\n\nRescue teams from Jiangsu's thirteen cities and counties, including those rushing from Shanghai, naturally wouldn't foolishly all rush towards Yancheng city center in a single go. Instead, they would proceed to various reported disaster areas based on unified dispatch.\n\nDoctor Lin's team quickly exited the highway and drove into a village under Funing County.\n\nAt this time, hail was still falling from the sky, and there were even small wind whirls in the distance. It was unknown if another tornado would form.\n\nMore than half of the houses in the village had collapsed to varying degrees; some old-style houses had almost all fallen down. There were many pedestrians on the road, and everyone looked somewhat panicked.\n\nAfter all, many local elders had never witnessed this kind of extreme natural disaster in their entire lives; everyone lacked experience. They used to often see mudslides, earthquakes, or typhoons happening elsewhere, but they never expected it to happen to them.\n\nAfter the ambulances arrived, injured residents spontaneously gathered to orderly receive wound treatment and care. Not far away, firefighters were also conducting search and rescue operations in the collapsed houses.\n\nZhou Ze parked his car behind. He didn't get out, but sat inside, watching Doctor Lin busy at the tent. Of course, so far, the situation here seemed pretty good; residents' injuries were only minor, no big deal.\n\nEven those with blood streaming down their faces were just superficial wounds; no one would die, so Zhou Ze saw no need to get involved.\n\nAbout half an hour later, a firefighter ran over, informing them that there were trapped individuals under the collapsed old house over there. The situation might be urgent, and doctors were needed to assist in the rescue.\n\nDoctor Lin immediately ran towards that direction with a male doctor. Zhou Ze dropped his cigarette butt and had no choice but to get out of the car.\n\nUnderneath the collapsed old house, firefighters were already conducting excavation work, but they had clearly encountered a difficulty. There were people trapped underneath, seemingly still pressed down. Blind excavation could cause the house to collapse again, posing a danger to those trapped below.\n\nSome villagers nearby also spontaneously participated in the rescue, but everyone dared not act rashly. They could only listen to the firefighters' instructions.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked over, Doctor Lin was shouting to the trapped individuals below to ascertain their physical condition. Her hair tie seemed to have fallen off somewhere, and the wind was very strong all around, blowing her hair up, but it didn't look messy.\n\nIn such a chaotic post-disaster environment, these people in white were inherently beautiful.\n\nA short firefighter walked past Zhou Ze. The notebook in Zhou Ze's pocket suddenly jolted; the intensity of this jolt was surprisingly no less than what he felt with Doctor Lin earlier!\n\nSubconsciously, Zhou Ze reached out and pressed the other person's shoulder.\n\nThe firefighter stopped in surprise, looked at Zhou Ze, and asked, \"Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"You... be careful.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't know what to say; for a moment, he was speechless. Could he possibly say, \"Don't go forward, you might die\"?\n\nBut if he didn't go,\n\nwho else would?\n\nThe young and short firefighter also paused for a moment,\n\nIt seemed he hadn't encountered such a situation either, but a warm current still flowed through his heart. He smiled and said:\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nThen, this firefighter went to the front and began tying ropes around himself. Because the collapsed house was originally a three-story building, the situation inside was quite complex. After discussion by the fire department, they decided to dispatch a short firefighter to first grope his way down and start the rescue operation from within.\n\nWatching that firefighter tying ropes around himself, Zhou Ze, standing in the crowd, pursed his lips, and then kept looking up and down.\n\nSo conflicted,\n\nso agonizing,\n\nIf you hadn't walked past me, I wouldn't know anything. If you sacrificed then, I could just mourn for you and offer my highest respect.\n\nBut now, this old man can actually foresee your sacrifice.\n\nZhou Ze decided that after this incident, he would have to find a way to shut down the notebook or stop carrying it with him.\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\nCursing himself for being a glutton for punishment,\n\nZhou Ze still squeezed out of the crowd, walked up to the short firefighter, and also picked up a rope to tie around himself.\n\nThe firefighters nearby were stunned. One person asked, \"Who are you? What are you doing? Don't interfere with the rescue!\"\n\nThis kind of rescue work really needs to be done by professionals. Many people participate in rescue with full enthusiasm, which is indeed very moving, but such reckless amateur behavior can sometimes lead both themselves and the trapped individuals into more dangerous situations.\n\nDoctor Lin also saw Zhou Ze. She didn't know Zhou Ze had actually been following her car all along, and was a bit surprised.\n\n\"I used to be a special forces soldier. I'm skilled. Let me go down.\"\n\nZhou Ze said calmly.\n\n\"Special forces?\" The team leader was stunned for a moment.\n\n\"Mm. Have you seen 'Wolf Warrior'?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"'Wolf Warrior'?\"\n\nThe team leader's face was full of black lines.\n\nWhat the hell are you talking about?!\n\n\"You ask her. She's my wife.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to Doctor Lin on the side.\n\nThe team leader looked at Doctor Lin. Doctor Lin suddenly wanted to laugh. What was going on?\n\nBut she knew Zhou Ze's identity and was also clear that if Zhou Ze was willing to participate in the rescue, he could indeed be much more capable than an ordinary person. Immediately, she also nodded and said:\n\n\"Yes, he's a retired special forces soldier.\"\n\nWith the doctor's assurance, the team leader felt relieved. This was precisely the time when people were needed, and he was naturally very willing to accept help from someone with professional skills.\n\nImmediately, the team leader pointed to the short firefighter beside Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"He Li, you go down with this warrior—oh, no... this comrade.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain.\"\n\n\"No, I can go down by myself. I find him in the way.\" Zhou Ze said dismissively.\n\n\"I won't be in the way!\"\n\nHe Li had already tied his safety rope, walked straight over, and with the help of his comrades around him, was lowered down through a small opening. Before going down, he also gave Zhou Ze a fierce glare.\n\nObviously, he had been underestimated by Zhou Ze earlier and was very angry.\n\nZhou Ze was truly helpless.\n\nThis old man rushed to offer selfless contribution, yet still couldn't stop your march to sacrifice?\n\nIn the future, whoever wants to be a behind-the-scenes hero can go do it; it's too stifling.\n\nZhou Ze could only quickly tie his safety rope and go down with him. The space below was truly cramped. Zhou Ze and the firefighter named He Li were about two meters apart. Both were looking for space to step and move downwards, trying their best to first make contact with the trapped individuals below.\n\n\"Waa-waa..................\"\n\nNot long after going down, Zhou Ze heard the crying of a baby below.\n\n\"Hey, hey!\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted downwards.\n\n\"We're down here.\" Someone below shouted.\n\n\"Don't move, we'll come down immediately to rescue you. Don't act rashly...\" He Li also shouted.\n\n\"My leg is pinned. My daughter-in-law and grandson are also there. You go save them first, save them.\" It was probably an old man below.\n\n\"Old man, don't worry, we've already begun the rescue operation............\"\n\n\"Clang...\"\n\nThe sound of something being pushed open came from below,\n\nThe old man below seemed to have heard his grandson crying and was forcefully pushing away things on top of him, intending to go see his daughter-in-law and grandson first.\n\nBut this clearly illegally built three-story house was already in a precarious state. The moment he moved below, the entire structure was affected. Zhou Ze felt the concrete slab under his feet begin to tremble again.\n\n\"Old man, don't move, don't move! We're coming down immediately, coming down immediately!\"\n\nBut below, movement continued.\n\n\"You f**king old dog, don't you dare move!\"\n\nZhou Ze directly started cursing.\n\nAs expected, cursing was more effective; the old man below immediately stopped moving.\n\nZhou Ze continuously bent and broke several reinforcing bars blocking the way with his fingernails, and even pried open the concrete seams, quickly getting down. Not far from him, a woman was lying there holding a child. Blood was flowing from the woman's head; she wasn't dead, but her mind was clearly somewhat unclear.\n\n\"Give the child to me first, the child!\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted to the woman.\n\nThe woman's eyes regained a bit of clarity. She struggled to crawl over and handed the child to Zhou Ze through a partition. She understood that if the rescuers got the child out earlier, the child would be out of danger sooner.\n\nZhou Ze took the child, and then handed him to He Li on the side, across the reinforcing bars, shouting to him, \"You take the child up first!\"\n\n\"You take the child up first!\" He Li said.\n\n\"Scram, you go up first!\"\n\nZhou Ze's attitude was very firm. He wasn't sure if the trapped individuals below could be rescued, but if this firefighter in front of him continued to stay inside, he would very likely be truly \"cold\" (dead).\n\nHe Li, forced by Zhou Ze's attitude, could only take the child and return the way he came.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, continued to tear open obstructions with his fingernails, pulled the woman out, then untied the safety rope from himself and tied it onto her, signaling for those above to pull her up first. At the same time, he shouted:\n\n\"Has the child gone up?\"\n\n\"The child is up, be careful down there!\" Doctor Lin shouted from above. \"The wind is picking up again, be careful.\"\n\nHeh heh.\n\nAlthough they were basically getting a divorce, the sound of a wife caring for her husband was truly quite enjoyable.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the woman from below, and the woman was finally slowly pulled up.\n\nAlright, only one old \"baby\" left.\n\nZhou Ze went over and saw the old man sitting on the ground with a miserable expression. A wooden board was pressed on his leg, its two ends firmly pinned by concrete slabs.\n\n\"Comrade, you go out first. I'm not in a hurry, this house is about to collapse.\"\n\nZhou Ze rolled his eyes at the other person.\n\nEarlier, you moved around down there and almost wiped us all out,\n\nNow you're starting to light the lamp of your soul again?\n\n\"Don't talk, I'll lift the wooden board a bit. You try to pull your leg out.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze used his fingernails to tear open the concrete slab's crack. At this moment, a stinging sensation came from his fingertips. Zhou Ze looked down and found that all ten of his fingers were already bleeding.\n\nEven if these fingernails were magical, they weren't power drills after all. Continuously dealing with these reinforcing bars and concrete was too much for them.\n\n\"Push hard!\"\n\nZhou Ze supported the wooden board with both hands.\n\n\"My leg is out, it's out.\"\n\nThe old man shouted.\n\n\"Can you still move?\"\n\n\"Yes, my leg isn't broken, I can move.\"\n\n\"Alright, follow this. You climb up first, grab that rope.\"\n\n\"You're injured, let me treat your wound.\"\n\nA female nurse was treating He Li's wounds.\n\nHe Li had several scratches from sharp objects on his body when he was down below earlier.\n\n\"I'm fine, I still need to go down and save people.\" He Li refused.\n\n\"Don't move, that woman is out too. There's only one person left below, you don't need to go down. Your wounds must be treated promptly, otherwise, what if they get infected?\"\n\nThe female nurse was very firm.\n\nHe Li had no choice but to let her treat his wounds.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nthe wind picked up again,\n\nmuch stronger than before. The tent was also rustling and flapping, as if it could be blown over at any moment.\n\nHe Li suddenly saw the tree in front, which had been leaning due to the wind earlier, start to sway again. He immediately pushed away the female nurse who was treating his wounds and rushed out.\n\nThe female nurse was pushed to the ground and said angrily, \"What are you doing!\"\n\nThat tree couldn't fall, because the direction it would fall was towards the collapsed house. Once this tree fell, the already crumbling collapsed house would certainly face a second collapse.\n\nHe Li had been down there before, naturally knowing that the situation below was actually unstable, and that the stress points in many areas were unbalanced.\n\n\"Creak............\"\n\nThe large tree began to tilt and fall; it couldn't hold on anymore.\n\nOthers around also noticed this, but they all didn't have time to react, and could only watch the large tree slowly fall.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nA short figure rushed out. He ran towards the direction where the large tree was falling.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe trunk of the large tree smashed onto his shoulder. He immediately spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and then knelt down, his knees directly hitting the ground, which even dented inwards. But because of his slowing down, the large tree didn't directly hit the ground.\n\nThe surrounding firefighters and villagers immediately rushed over, began to hold the large tree, and tried every means to move it away.\n\nThe large tree was finally safely moved to the ground,\n\nbut that short figure kneeling on the ground,\n\ncould no longer stand up.\n\nThe old man was pulled up,\n\nAfterwards,\n\nZhou Ze also came up.\n\nDoctor Lin rushed over crying and embraced Zhou Ze. At this moment, Zhou Ze was covered in dust and ash from head to toe, but Doctor Lin didn't mind it at all.\n\nReaching out, Zhou Ze patted Doctor Lin's back, signaling that he was fine,\n\nexcept for his fingernails,\n\nthey hurt so much.\n\n\"Phew............\"\n\nHe let out a long breath.\n\nDoctor Lin began to examine Zhou Ze's body to see if there were any wounds that needed treatment.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, pulled out a deformed cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and asked:\n\n\"Where's that short firefighter?\"\n\nHe came up a while ago, he should be fine, right? If he's fine, then you should also be fine.\n\nThis broken notebook certainly couldn't compare to the hints in the 'Final Destination' movies; it wasn't that mysterious. After all, its \"grade\"² had fallen.\n\nHearing this, Doctor Lin suddenly stiffened.\n\nZhou Ze slowly furrowed his brows and asked:\n\n\"Where's that firefighter?\"\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over to the tent,\n\nand saw the short body covered by a white sheet,\n\nHe subconsciously clenched the burning cigarette held between his fingertips into his palm, then abruptly pulled Doctor Lin's hand and dragged her towards his car.\n\n\"What are you doing, what are you doing............You're hurting me.\"\n\n\"Come with me, leave this place with me!\"\n\n\"I still have work to do, I still need to continue saving people.\" Doctor Lin retorted.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over Doctor Lin,\n\nDoctor Lin saw that Zhou Ze's eyes were filled with bloodshot, which was very terrifying.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nZhou Ze put one arm around Doctor Lin's head, resting her face against his chest. To outsiders, it looked like a young couple talking,\n\nBut what Zhou Ze said was:\n\n\"If you don't come with me,\n\nI will now,\n\nkill you.\"\n___\n¹ A common Chinese idiom referring to a soul inhabiting another's body, often used to describe reincarnation or spiritual possession.\n² Refers to a decrease in the quality or power of something, often used in a mystical or game-like context.",

    "content": "In the Nissan car, Zhou Ze sat in the driver's seat, and Dr. Lin sat in the passenger seat.\n\nOriginally, a newlywed couple, young and spirited, sitting together in a car, it would be easy for a bit of intimacy to arise. Under the striking of thunder and fire*, even the car body would involuntarily shake a little out of respect.\n\nBut at this moment, here, the atmosphere was somewhat awkward.\n\nZhou Ze continued smoking, the figure of the short firefighter constantly re-emerging in his mind.\n\nHe felt a little sad. Perhaps that firefighter, in the end, still harbored dissatisfaction and hatred towards him because he had ridiculed him face-to-face. Yet, at the last moment, he still held up the large tree with his frail shoulders.\n\nOtherwise, once that building collapsed again, both he and the old man probably wouldn't have made it out.\n\nHe knew his own situation clearly. Zhou Ze's body was also flesh and blood. Even an infernal constable, in that environment, would still die. Perhaps there might be a slim chance of survival if he entered a zombie state, but at that moment, he was completely caught off guard and had no time to enter that state.\n\nTherefore, ultimately, that firefighter had saved his life.\n\nHe had originally intended to save him, but in the end, he was saved by him.\n\nThis feeling made Zhou Ze sigh with emotion, but it was also the firefighter's sacrifice that caused Zhou Ze great torment regarding the predictive ability of this broken notebook.\n\nDr. Lin, would she also be destined to die?\n\n\"If the King of Hell wants you dead by the third watch, who dares keep you till the fifth*.\"\n\nThe notebook had already been tossed into the car by Zhou Ze. He didn't plan to carry this thing with him anymore. Otherwise, walking on the street later, with one person \"about to die\" and another \"possibly dying,\" he would truly be more exhausted than those superheroes bursting with bleeding-heart compassion*.\n\nOut of sight, out of mind. Birth, aging, sickness, and death are the norm for humans. You all just do as you please.\n\nDr. Lin bit her lip. She didn't know what to say. Zhou Ze's forceful stance made her a little uncomfortable. At the same time, she also knew that if something truly serious wasn't about to happen, Zhou Ze wouldn't be like this.\n\n\"Can you... explain it clearly to me? What exactly is going on?\" Dr. Lin asked, wanting to hear an explanation.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips and said:\n\n\"I have something that can predict a person's recent life-and-death situation. It predicted that you'll die very soon. Before, it had already predicted that firefighter would die. I tried to save him, but he still died in the end.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Dr. Lin's expression became solemn.\n\nShe didn't refute Zhou Ze at all, nor did she forcefully demand that Zhou Ze let her out, shouting that even if she were to die, she would die at her post, or that there were many injured here who needed her treatment, and so on.\n\nShe was very calm. After listening to Zhou Ze's explanation, she calmly accepted Zhou Ze's method of handling the situation.\n\nZhou Ze was very satisfied with this. It was also Dr. Lin's most appealing quality; she was truly graceful and understanding. When he was with her, she always made him feel at ease.\n\nReaching out, he held Dr. Lin's hand, feeling that her palm was a bit cold. Zhou Ze smiled:\n\n\"I'm by your side, it'll be fine.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded, continuing to sit in the passenger seat. However, she seemed to think of something and asked, \"Will I affect you?\"\n\nDr. Lin was worried that Zhou Ze might encounter an accident while trying to save her.\n\n\"We haven't divorced yet, after all.\"\n\nDr. Lin fell silent, continuing to sit quietly.\n\nThe rescue efforts there had actually quickly gotten on track. Although the wind was still strong, extreme phenomena like the previous tornado no longer occurred. Coupled with rescue teams arriving from various places, disaster relief work was proceeding in an orderly manner.\n\nPeople from the hospital had come to inquire about Dr. Lin's situation, but Zhou Ze had fended them off, citing his wife's discomfort.\n\nWell, given Zhou Ze's previous \"Wolf Warrior\"*-like performance in saving people, the hospital staff wouldn't say anything about Dr. Lin's absence. After all, the couple had already done more than enough.\n\nThere were some snacks and water in the car. Zhou Ze told Dr. Lin to eat something, while he took out his phone and dialed Little Lolita's number.\n\nThe call connected quickly, and Little Lolita's displeased voice came through:\n\n\"I found the priest for you, but when are you coming back? What if he runs away? Do you know how many times I almost got discovered while tracking him? He's probably already become alert...\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nLittle Lolita immediately fell silent.\n\n\"I have a Yin-Yang Scroll in my hand, said to be an item used by a Judge.\"\n\n\"You really found that thing?\"\n\nLittle Lolita had actually guessed something when she saw Sun Qiu's ghost before, which was why she thought Zhou Ze would likely die there at the time.\n\nBut what she didn't expect was that Zhou Ze not only survived safely but also got his hands on that thing.\n\nThis matter was absolutely shocking. One must know that the Underworld has a strict hierarchy, and infernal constables are the lowest rank in the Underworld's order. It was somewhat like two ancient gate guards, and one day, one of them took out the Imperial Seal of the Realm to show off to the other.\n\n\"It, can it predict life and death?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It can sense life and death,\" Little Lolita corrected.\n\n\"Is it 100% accurate?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I don't know about that, but its accuracy should be quite high. However, it can't be 100% accurate. Even the Book of Life and Death in the hands of the Ten Kings of Hell can have issues, let alone something at a Judge's level. Moreover, if I'm not mistaken, the Yin-Yang Scroll in your hand should have a problem; its quality has dropped?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then it probably won't be that accurate.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze hung up the phone.\n\nIn the bookstore, Little Lolita angrily slammed her phone onto the table!\n\nWhat kind of person is this!\n\nHe hangs up right after he's done talking. When he needs something, he asks me to solve it, and when he doesn't, he just kicks me aside, is that it?\n\nShe had still wanted to remind him that since he was in another city, he should greet the local infernal constables, otherwise, it would be a provocation. Moreover, they had just experienced a natural disaster over there, and were probably busy to the point of dizziness. An out-of-town infernal constable going there without a heads-up or prior warning could easily cause misunderstandings.\n\nForget it. You handle it yourself. This old lady isn't serving you anymore.\n\n..................\n\n\"You eat some too.\"\n\nDr. Lin handed Zhou Ze a piece of bread.\n\nZhou Ze took the bread, bit into it with great difficulty, and chewed it with extreme pain.\n\n\"Let's stay here for now,\" Zhou Ze said. \"I'm not comfortable driving home like this either.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded in agreement.\n\nAt dusk, Zhou Ze told Dr. Lin to sleep first and rest for a while, while he stood outside the car. The rescue teams had already left this village. They were going to other disaster areas to help. Currently, this village was still relatively quiet. Half of the houses, due to their good quality, had not been blown down, and many villagers were staying there, while some had already gone to join relatives.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He had a premonition that if they could make it until tomorrow and still be safe, this hurdle would probably be over.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze looked into the car, Dr. Lin was on the phone, telling her younger sister-in-law to do her homework diligently and not to be greedy for play or watch TV, and so on.\n\nZhou Ze was also thinking that if the infernal constable possessing his younger sister-in-law were still around, he could now have one more person to share the burden, as both sides were aligned on the point of protecting Dr. Lin. Unfortunately, some things could only be thought about. Zhou Ze did not regret killing that infernal constable.\n\nAs night deepened, Zhou Ze returned to the car and turned on the interior light.\n\nAfter finishing her call, Dr. Lin began to fall asleep. Zhou Ze kept his eyes open, paying attention to his surroundings.\n\nTo be honest, if it were like *Final Destination*, where all sorts of incredible coincidences connect to ensure you die in an accident, that would truly be impossible to resist. But he thought it shouldn't be that terrifying.\n\nAround late night, Zhou Ze, who was somewhat tired but couldn't sleep at all because Bai Yingying wasn't beside him, suddenly heard the sound of tools banging.\n\nVery close, just a short distance in front of where they were parked. It was a two-story building that had also collapsed due to the tornado.\n\nIt was possible that villagers were salvaging their property from the collapsed house. Zhou Ze had no intention of being nosy. At a time like this, he couldn't leave Dr. Lin alone here and go outside to ask if anyone needed help.\n\nAt this moment, Dr. Lin, who had slept for a while, woke up. She looked at Zhou Ze with a bit of heartache, reaching out to cover him with the clothes she was wearing.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I want to... relieve myself.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around. \"Just in the bushes behind the car. No one will see.\"\n\nDr. Lin was a bit embarrassed but still nodded.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze accompanied her out of the car.\n\nDr. Lin hesitated for a moment, then didn't shy away from anything, nor did she ask Zhou Ze to turn around. Right in front of Zhou Ze, she took off her pants and squatted down.\n\nIn many ghost movies, there's always this idiotic plot point, which is that even knowing it's dangerous nearby, when a girl in the group needs to pee, they foolishly tell the person protecting them to turn around and not look, because she's shy.\n\nAnd then, an accident happens right at that moment.\n\nZhou Ze certainly wouldn't repeat such brainless plotlines and setups.\n\nTherefore, he stood perfectly straight, staring! Looking carefully! Looking closely! To ensure safety, safety first!\n\nSoon, Dr. Lin stood up, her cheeks flushed, and walked back to the car with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You get in first. I'll get some water from the trunk.\"\n\nDr. Lin obediently got into the car first, taking the passenger seat.\n\nHowever, after she sat down, her body suddenly stiffened.\n\n\"What do you want to drink? Old Xu stored quite a lot of stuff here; there are drinks, mineral water, and milk.\" Zhou Ze called out from behind.\n\nDr. Lin didn't answer, because she found that, in the driver's seat, at some unknown point, someone had already gotten in, and this person looked exactly like Zhou Ze, and this person turned their head, smiled at her, and softly said:\n\n\"Quick, he's asking you, what do you want to drink?\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n*   **striking of thunder and fire (天雷勾動地火):** Literally \"heavenly thunder ignites earthly fire,\" an idiom describing intense passion or a spontaneous combustion of emotions.\n*   **\"If the King of Hell wants you dead by the third watch, who dares keep you till the fifth\" (閻王叫你三更死哪敢留人到五更):** An idiom meaning that when one's time is up according to fate, no one can prevent it. \"Third watch\" and \"fifth watch\" refer to traditional Chinese timekeeping; the third watch is around midnight, and the fifth watch is before dawn.\n*   **bleeding-heart compassion (聖母心爆棚):** Literally \"bursting with Madonna-like compassion,\" an idiom used to describe excessive, sometimes naive or misplaced, empathy or pity, often in a slightly sarcastic or critical tone.\n*   **Wolf Warrior (戰狼):** Refers to a popular Chinese action film series known for its patriotic and often nationalistic themes.

    "content": "The man in the driver's seat did indeed look exactly like Zhou Ze, but Doctor Lin knew that the real Zhou Ze was in the trunk getting drinks.\n\nCoupled with what Zhou Ze had told her earlier, she knew that danger could strike at any moment, and now, it had actually happened.\n\nThe man held a notebook, which Zhou Ze had held earlier. He was toying with it, seemingly very interested in it, but he did not open it, just kept flipping it in his hand.\n\nHowever, he looked at Doctor Lin much more often than at the notebook. Clearly, in his opinion, Doctor Lin was more important than this notebook.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe man let out a light chuckle and leaned slightly back.\n\nThen, a wisp of green smoke drifted out from his mouth, carrying a strong hallucinogenic effect. Doctor Lin still wanted to call out to Zhou Ze in the back, to warn him, but in an instant, she herself lost consciousness.\n\nEverything happened too quickly, simply not giving her more time to think or react. She was just an ordinary person, not some special forces soldier or queen.\n\nThe man calmly adjusted his clothes, pushed open the car door, and got out.\n\nThe moment he got out, he completely transformed into Doctor Lin's appearance. The clothes and demeanor were exactly the same, leaving no trace of a flaw.\n\nEven the blush that had not fully faded from her cheeks was still present.\n\nThis was enough to show that he was an absolute perfectionist, a person who nitpicked every detail.\n\nUnlike the Faceless Woman, his transformation was more like an art of continuous improvement, while the Faceless Woman's transformation was simply a crude application.\n\nHe walked to the back and saw Zhou Ze, who had just closed the trunk and was holding drinks.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A little scared,\" he said, his voice exactly like Doctor Lin's, very gentle.\n\n\"I'm here, don't be afraid.\"\n\nAfter saying that,\n\nZhou Ze put down the drinks and directly pulled him into his arms.\n\n\"............\" He.\n\nSimple,\n\nCrude,\n\nEven he was somewhat caught off guard.\n\nFeeling the warmth from another man's body, a surge of anger and disgust flashed in his eyes, but he did not resist. Instead, in an instant,\n\nhe opened his mouth.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nBefore the green smoke could be exhaled,\n\na hand directly covered his lips, pressing down hard.\n\nZhou Ze turned his face, looking at him with a half-smile.\n\nHe was a little confused. Of course, most importantly, the green smoke in his mouth could neither be coughed out nor swallowed, which made him very uncomfortable.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA knee heavily struck his abdomen. He opened his mouth, let out a pained groan, and began to curl up on the ground.\n\nHe was somewhat puzzled, lifted his head, and looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"There's a woman on the Road to the Underworld who always likes to cosplay others. Sorry, but I've been trained by her. So, consider yourself unlucky. Now, anyone who imitates someone close to me to approach me, I get a special premonition.\"\n\nHaving had the experience of being 'specially trained' by the Faceless Woman, Zhou Ze's sensitivity in that regard was almost fully activated, like an instinct.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, grabbed his neck—his body somewhat limp, still in Doctor Lin's appearance—and dragged him to the car door. Zhou Ze observed Doctor Lin's condition and found that she was just asleep, not seriously harmed.\n\nDragged by Zhou Ze like a dead dog, his body was slightly twitching.\n\nZhou Ze let go. He fell to the ground, smoke rising from all over his body, as if many otaku's girlfriends had deflated*, and his entire body began to shrivel.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nwalked a man and a woman. The man was very tall, about 1.9 meters, wearing military camouflage, revealing his muscular arms, and looking very strong.\n\nThe woman was not tall, with a face full of freckles, chewing gum in her mouth, constantly blowing bubbles.\n\nA wisp of green smoke slowly condensed behind the woman, and a female figure appeared. The woman was wearing a long green dress, standing behind the two somewhat timidly, seemingly anxious about being discovered and failing her mission.\n\nHowever, she still lowered her head and whispered something to the tall man and the woman.\n\nThe tall man shook his neck, producing several consecutive cracking sounds from his joints, then clenched his fists. He said nothing, but it was also a form of demonstration.\n\nThe freckled woman, meanwhile, reached out and spat out the chewing gum from her mouth, casually sticking it onto the muscular arm of the man beside her. She walked a few steps forward, looked at Zhou Ze, and asked with a smile:\n\n\"Brother, you've crossed the line.\"\n\nAre they local Ghost Envoys?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't very clear on how Ghost Envoys from one place should get along with Ghost Envoys from another, nor was he clear on the unspoken rules between Ghost Envoys. Among the two Ghost Envoys he knew,\n\none had been killed by him,\n\nand one had been captured by him.\n\nIt seemed that when dealing with peers, Zhou Ze had always been that simple and crude.\n\nLittle Loli had originally wanted to remind Zhou Ze that once he arrived in Yancheng, it would be best to greet the local Ghost Envoys, just like the Pockmarked Monk had first visited Zhou Ze when he came to Tongcheng.\n\nSometimes a greeting, a heads-up, can avoid a lot of trouble.\n\nIt was just that Zhou Ze had hung up the phone directly at the time, causing Little Loli's reminder not to be conveyed. Perhaps, even if Little Loli had said it, Zhou Ze wouldn't have abandoned Doctor Lin to go 'party' with the Yancheng peers.\n\nMoreover, in Zhou Ze's view, the other party had made the first move. The previous stance clearly intended for that female ghost to drug both him and Doctor Lin.\n\n\"So what?\"\n\nFacing the other party's questioning, Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nHe was here to save people, to save Doctor Lin. At the same time, he also saved a family. He wasn't here to steal things or act like a bandit.\n\n\"Brother, your tone of voice makes me mistakenly think that Lord Inspector himself has graced us with his presence.\"\n\nThe freckled woman smiled slightly, then reached out, parted her hair, and said at the same time:\n\n\"Leave the woman in the car. You can leave. We can then drop the matter of you crossing the border without greeting.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at her,\n\nsaying nothing.\n\nAt first, the freckled girl thought Zhou Ze was considering,\n\nBut slowly,\n\nthe freckled girl realized Zhou Ze's gaze was like he was looking at an idiot.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be blamed. He truly didn't know how to get along with peers, having no concept at all of such unspoken rules and so-called forbidden territories.\n\nPerhaps, Zhou Ze's biggest concept of the Ghost Envoy group came from the one who returned severely injured from Rongcheng,\n\nA single person, in one night, killed dozens of Ghost Envoys. Their Ghost Envoy badges just fell all over the ground, like cabbages by the roadside, a handful with every grab.\n\nTherefore, it's very possible Zhou Ze's perception had also been skewed at that time.\n\nAlways felt that his peers were all small fry, like the small mobs in online games that give experience.\n\n\"This woman, we must keep her. She has something we want.\"\n\nAfter saying that,\n\nthe freckled girl stepped forward,\n\nWith a stride,\n\na gust of Yin wind swept over, carrying a heavy sensation, like grease.\n\nZhou Ze felt his body suddenly become much heavier, and the air around him instantly became incredibly thin.\n\nThe tall man also walked over at this moment, approaching Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze extended his claws,\n\nbut the other party was faster, directly gripped Zhou Ze's wrist, then flipped it back.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze was slammed against the car door, and the car door consequently dented inwards.\n\nLittle Loli had once given Zhou Ze immense terror,\n\nbut now Little Loli had been brought under his control,\n\nAnd now, the feeling of fear of being dominated by a veteran Ghost Envoy seemed to strike again.\n\nThe tall man smiled at Zhou Ze and reached out to choke Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"Just stay put in your Tongcheng. Why run around blindly? And bringing her along... You're basically taking a car full of treasure and strolling in front of a bandit's den. Are you intentionally looking for trouble?\"\n\n\"She... what's wrong with her?\"\n\nZhou Ze was very confused.\n\nIf the other party was after his notebook, that would be easy to understand. After all, that was the Yin-Yang Scroll used by the Judge, and even if its quality had declined, it was still a Yin-Yang Scroll.\n\nBut the other party seemed to be 'buying the casket and returning the pearls'*, what they valued was actually Doctor Lin.\n\nWhat was wrong with Doctor Lin?\n\n\"A person who has been blessed by a Ghost Envoy at the cost of sacrificing their own merits, what do you think she means?\"\n\nThe freckled girl looked at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"A rookie is a rookie. You can't even understand this. Or perhaps, you do understand, but you've just been pretending not to see. Trying to play out some cliché human-ghost romance?\n\nYou are a ghost, a dead person, not a person of the living world. Having too many ties with ordinary living people will only harm her. This is a piece of advice for you, kid.\"\n\nThe freckled girl took the chewing gum off the tall man's arm, put it back into her mouth and chewed it, then opened the car door and looked at Doctor Lin, who was sitting unconscious inside.\n\n\"I'm very curious. That Ghost Envoy who willingly gave up so much just to bless her... Their rank should be a bit higher than ours. I can't believe they were so willing.\"\n\nZhou Ze knew that the Ghost Envoy the freckled girl was talking about should be the Ghost Envoy who had once possessed his sister-in-law. It was natural that she was good to Doctor Lin.\n\nShe was even good to her to the point of obsession. That he was where he was today was also thanks to her.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to remember that when he killed her, her Ghost Envoy badge was already close to collapsing, and it ultimately didn't remain. Did this mean that she had actually overdrawn beforehand?\n\nOverdrawn on the blessing that this freckled girl spoke of?\n\n\"Don't touch her.\"\n\nThe tall man, still choking Zhou Ze's neck, found it somewhat amusing that Zhou Ze was still warning and threatening at this moment.\n\n\"Of course, we won't kill her. We only want the blessing on her. We are Ghost Envoys, enforcers of the Underworld. We certainly won't kill living people.\n\nDon't worry. Even though you're a rookie, you are still one of our peers. We'll still give you this much face. At most, she'll just get a serious illness, and after a year or two of recovery, she'll be fine.\"\n\nThe tall man reached out, patted Zhou Ze's face, and said admiringly:\n\n\"You picked a really good 'skin'. Much more handsome than my big frame. I'm really quite envious of you.\"\n\nThe freckled girl spat the re-warmed chewing gum from her mouth into her palm, then placed it on Doctor Lin's forehead.\n\n\"Hey, be careful.

    "content": "The tall man felt a bone-chilling cold emanating from his palm. He subconsciously wanted to let go, as this icy sensation seemed to have pierced through his flesh and stimulated his soul, causing him a terrifying tremor.\n\nBut his hand was stuck.\n\nBefore, he had been gripping Zhou Ze's throat. Now, Zhou Ze had deliberately lowered his jaw, trapping the man's palm tightly against his own neck.\n\nThe freckled girl stood up straight, watching Zhou Ze. She was wise and rational; the moment that unbelievable malevolence erupted from Zhou Ze, she began to calculate.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said with a smile, \"if you're a Constable or Inspector on an incognito tour, please just state your identity. We'll offer our apologies and amends. Can we just pretend today never happened?\"\n\nThose who had died once were always smarter than the living, and better at knowing what's appropriate.\nJust as the little loli, gravely injured upon her return, had submitted to Zhou Ze, it was precisely because they had died that they understood the preciousness of continuing to cling to life in this manner.\nHell truly was a place of great terror.\n\nIf it were the old Zhou Ze, he might indeed have backed down, but unfortunately, the current Zhou Ze had already lost his reason.\n\nA bronze glow slowly began to emanate from his skin, suffusing his entire body. Two fangs slowly emerged, chillingly prominent. His face became livid, his eyes devoid of life, and carried an innate coldness.\n\n\"Crack…\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe tall man let out a cry of pain. Zhou Ze's two fangs pierced directly into the back of his hand. In an instant, the man's entire body began to convulse; that single bite seemed to cripple most of his physical form.\n\nThe tall man kicked out, hoping to send Zhou Ze flying, or at least break free from him. However, his foot was immediately caught by one of Zhou Ze's hands. He tried to kick, he tried to exert force, but his foot remained immobile. This young man, whom he had previously patted on the cheek and called a pretty boy, seemed to possess terrifying power within his body, completely overpowering him.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head. With a \"rip,\" the fangs tore off a large chunk of flesh from the back of the tall man's palm. Simultaneously, Zhou Ze's fingernails took on a dark red hue, and the five fingers gripping the man's shoe began to apply pressure.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nA crisp sound, like a small firecracker exploding during Chinese New Year. The tall man's shoe had burst open, and along with it, his foot shattered.\n\nThe tall man retreated in terror, collapsing to the ground. Zhou Ze lowered his head slightly, leaning to the side as he stared at the man. His gaze was as still as an ancient well.\n\nA moment later, Zhou Ze raised his hand, inspecting his palm with a hint of disdain. He then crouched down and wiped his hand on the man's body.\n\nWhat if there were athlete's foot?\nWhat to do?\nIt seemed some habits truly couldn't be broken. For example, cleanliness?\n\nThe tall man lay flat on his back, not daring to move. Their positions had been completely reversed.\n\n\"Friend,\" the freckled woman said to Zhou Ze, \"we can talk this out. You know, even for Ghost Messengers, choosing a physical body is a one-time opportunity.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't respond, as if the woman didn't exist at all.\n\nHis hand slowly settled on the man's chest, fingertips gently drawing downwards from his neck. His nails were like the sharpest scalpels. With a crisp sound, like leather being torn, the tall man's chest was completely sliced open, yet he didn't even bleed. These nails were simply too sharp!\n\nThe tall man looked at the woman beside him, his eyes pleading for help.\n\nThe freckled woman could no longer remain calm. Her palm splayed open, and the surrounding air once again grew heavy, an immense pressure beginning to bear down on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nA suppressed roar erupted from Zhou Ze's throat. The black mist swirling around him instantly boiled, and even the air seemed tainted with a torturous heat.\n\nThe freckled woman stumbled, took two steps back, and collapsed to the ground. Her gaze, fixed on Zhou Ze, was filled with genuine terror.\n\nDamn it, was this still a Ghost Messenger?! How could this possibly still be a Ghost Messenger!\n\nAt this moment, the freckled girl truly felt as if they had a traitor in their midst. People used to say a husky had appeared among a pack of wolves; now, it was the other way around—a real prairie wolf had infiltrated a group of huskies.\n\nZhou Ze squatted beside the tall man, wisps of black smoke continuously emanating. Upon closer inspection, it became clear that the tall man's limbs were completely bound by the black smoke, rendering him utterly immobile.\n\nZhou Ze was a doctor, so he was very experienced when performing surgery. He meticulously examined the tall man's \"ailments.\" Liver, lungs, intestines—he took them out, one by one, dangling them before the tall man, and then tossed them aside.\n\nAt this point, it would have been even better to have a few medical students on hand, who could have taken photos, made notes, and offered their \"awesome\"<sup>1</sup> praises to their teacher. God help him, the tall man was utterly dumbfounded, yet he couldn't faint. He was even numb to the point of feeling no pain—which was the most excruciating torture: being forced to watch with open eyes!\n\nZhou Ze continued on his way, as if a teenager had discovered a new and fascinating toy. It had been a long time since he'd played this \"study of the human body\" game. He'd missed it a bit. Yes, this was the feeling. The human body truly was the most marvelous existence in the world, its harmony, its beauty, the intricate design of every single blood vessel—all so masterfully crafted, converging to form the architecture of life, bearing the weight of the soul.\n\n\"He's a Ghost Messenger! You can't kill him! Aren't you afraid of punishment from the Underworld?!\" the freckled woman, sprawled on the ground, shrieked. She was about to be driven insane, truly about to be driven insane. The scene before her, the atmosphere before her, even surpassed the Asura battlefields of Hell!\n\n\"We didn't mean to kill her, we told you, we didn't want to kill her! We made a mistake, but it's not a capital offense! We didn't want to make mortal enemies with you, really! We didn't want to kill anyone, nor did we want to kill you! You're the one who crossed the line! You crossed it without a word! You're also at fault! You're also at fault!\" the freckled girl continued to shout.\n\nZhou Ze paid no attention, continuing his work. A moment later, he clapped his hands, his examination complete.\n\nAfterwards, he lowered his head, opened his mouth, and began to inhale.\n\n\"Sssssssssssssss…\"\n\nIt was like a bowl of water poured into a pot of boiling oil, instantly exploding. The tall man's black soul was ripped out and flowed into Zhou Ze's mouth. His corpse began to rapidly decay, turning into putrid fluid.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head, closing his eyes. The taste of a soul… truly delicious.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze rose to his feet and walked over to the freckled girl. The freckled girl instinctively scrambled backward. She was terrified, truly terrified. Even in the presence of the Inspector, she had never felt such distinct fear!\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head, slowly walking forward, but still moving faster than her frantic crawling. Slowly, Zhou Ze caught up to her speed. Slowly, Zhou Ze walked to her side. Slowly, Zhou Ze raised his foot. Slowly, Zhou Ze lowered his foot, pressing it onto her abdomen.\n\nEverything was slow, like a winding, melodious piano piece, moving with its own unique rhythm.\n\n\"Pthk!\"\n\nOne foot, pressing through, like a railroad spike, pinned the woman in place. Foamy blood continuously bubbled from the woman's mouth, her body trembling and twisting without cease.\n\n\"I've said so much, analyzed so much with you, explained so many principles, warned you of so much power... if you want to kill me, just kill me, but could you at least, from start to finish, not say a single word?!\"\n\nThis was the freckled woman's greatest source of indignation. It seemed that in the other party's eyes, she and the tall man were ants, unworthy even of conversation.\n\nZhou Ze had already delivered the first stomp. He let out a satisfied burp, looking somewhat resigned. Facing delicious food after already being full was truly agonizing.\n\nAfterwards, he again raised his foot. Still slowly lifted. Still slowly fell.\n\n\"Splat!\"\n\nHer skull burst open, effectively solving the woman's freckle problem. Along with her soul, which was pulverized by the surrounding black mist, her corpse rapidly decomposed, merging with the ground around it.\n\nZhou Ze then appeared somewhat bewildered. He stood in place, seeming to be thinking about something. It seemed he had devoured a Ghost Messenger's soul once before, and now he had done it again, so this time, his duration of existence seemed a bit longer than the previous two. But a longer duration also brought its own troubles. For example: Who am I? Where am I? Where am I going?\n\nHe truly was pondering these questions, and after much deliberation, he turned his head and saw Doctor Lin sitting in the car. He walked over, approaching the car, lowered his head, and rubbed his fangs against Doctor Lin's flawless face. Some drool from his mouth dripped onto Doctor Lin's forehead, then spread down her face, obscuring it. He seemed to revel in this sensation, completely captivated by it.\n\nHis gaze then fell upon the notebook that had been left on the driver's seat, not taken by the green-clad female ghost earlier. He reached out and picked up the notebook.\n\nAs the notebook neared Doctor Lin, it began to tremble violently, indicating that she would soon die. This was a warning from the Yin-Yang Tome. It was said that King Yama's Book of Life and Death recorded the birth and death times of every person, possessing supreme authority. The Yin-Yang Tome, having originated from the Book of Life and Death, possessed similar functions.\n\nThe notebook trembled violently, incessantly, reminding its master: This woman... will die soon!\n\nZhou Ze gazed at the notebook with a touch of bewilderment, as if it were a curious new toy. However, this toy was clearly not much fun; its vibrations only annoyed him further.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nHe held the notebook before him, and Zhou Ze let out an angry roar at it.\n\nThen, then, then, it truly quieted down. It stopped vibrating...\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> Original Chinese internet slang \"66666\" (liùliùliùliùliù) is an onomatopoeia for \"cool\" or \"awesome,\" resembling the English word \"slick.\"",

    "content": "Late morning, the sun finally came out, a scene of beautiful, sunny weather, a stark contrast to yesterday's winds, rain, and raging tornadoes.\n\nDoctor Lin narrowed her eyes; she had finally woken up from her unconscious state of last night.\n\nWhen she woke, she found her face felt dry, as if something sticky was on it, even stuck to her eyes. She reached out and gently wiped her face, then opened her eyes and saw white smudges wiped onto her palm.\n\nShe then pulled down the car's sun visor mirror, only to see her face covered in these white stains, emanating a strong odor.\n\nThough Doctor Lin was inexperienced in such matters, she was a doctor after all, and information was very advanced in this age; it was no longer the ancient era where mothers showed their daughters erotic prints to teach them before marriage.\n\nThese marks on her face seemed to be… semen stains.\n\nSubconsciously opening the car door, Doctor Lin felt a panic in her heart. The bizarre scene from last night still left her with a lingering fear. Then, she saw Zhou Ze, covered in blood, sitting on the ground leaning against the car door.\n\nZhou Ze at this moment was truly miserable; his entire body seemed to lack a single patch of good skin, like a prisoner who had just been severely tortured and thrown out to fend for himself.\n\n“A'Ze, A'Ze!”\n\nDoctor Lin immediately squatted down, calling Zhou Ze's name, fearing that something might happen to him.\n\nThis time, the duration of his unconsciousness was much shorter than before, as if his body had slowly gotten used to it. Perhaps it was also due to devouring the souls of several ghost messengers, which had nourished and strengthened some parts of him.\n\nIn any case, after being unconscious for only half the night, Zhou Ze actually opened his eyes at Doctor Lin's calls.\n\nWhat met his eyes was Doctor Lin's face at that moment. Zhou Ze immediately gasped in fright, complaining with difficulty:\n\n“Early in the morning, still putting on a face mask, huh.”\n\nDoctor Lin was both annoyed and amused, but Zhou Ze in his current state couldn't be hit nor could she bear to scold him. She could only pull out a wet wipe from the car and wipe her face.\n\nAs she wiped, she also paid attention to distinguish it; it seemed not to be semen stains.\n\n“I’ll call for emergency services for you,” Doctor Lin said.\n\n“Don’t…”\n\nZhou Ze weakly shook his head,\n\n“Call the bookstore… tell Old Daoist… to bring his monkey, here.”\n\nDoctor Lin hesitated, suppressing her professional instinct to call emergency services. She chose to follow Zhou Ze's instructions, taking his phone and calling the bookstore.\n\nIt happened to be Old Daoist who answered the phone, immediately understanding that his boss had gone on a rampage* again.\n\nWithout hesitation, he said he would set off immediately with the monkey.\n\n“Where do we go now?” Doctor Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\n“Let’s just find a place to settle down for now,” Zhou Ze said. “Help me into the car, you drive, find a small motel. Oh, right, check the grass over there, look for anything resembling a driver’s license, and pick it up for me.”\n\nHearing this, Doctor Lin immediately went to the grass patch in front to search. It was actually very easy to find; two areas of grass clearly had oil stains, as if someone had poured lard on them late at night.\n\nOf course, Doctor Lin naturally couldn't directly discern that it was actually corpse oil.\n\n“Is this it?”\n\nDoctor Lin found two small booklets and handed them to Zhou Ze.\n\nBoth ghost messenger’s badges had yellowed, but they weren't damaged, meaning they could still be used.\n\n“That’s it.”\n\nZhou Ze signaled Doctor Lin to put these two things away, then, with her help, he got into the car himself.\n\nThere were almost no large, intact, uninjured areas on his body, but fortunately, Zhou Ze was also getting used to it. And with Doctor Lin sitting beside him, he wasn't in so much pain that he had to yell.\n\nHowever, because they had just experienced a tornado attack, many residents whose homes were damaged or collapsed chose to temporarily stay in motels. Therefore, from this village all the way to the small county town, all motels, regardless of size, basically had no vacant rooms.\n\nDoctor Lin drove the car to the far end of the county town, got out, and continued to inquire at a small motel there.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, slumped in the passenger seat, looking at the sky through the car window.\n\nJust then, an old man carrying a vegetable basket walked past the car door.\n\nThe old man was truly very old, with a full head of white hair and a goatee. His figure was hunched, but his walk still exuded a sense of vigor.\n\nMost importantly, as the old man walked past Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze distinctly felt that his gaze, as he looked at him, seemed to be pierced.\n\nThe old man stopped, looked at Zhou Ze in the car, a bit curious, reached out and tapped on the glass, and asked:\n\n“Young man, were you affected by the disaster?”\n\nMeaning, was he injured in the tornado attack?\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n“Why don’t you go to the hospital?” the old man asked curiously.\n\n“Poor.”\n\n“…………” The old man.\n\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, the old man reached his hand in, examined Zhou Ze’s injuries, and said, “These superficial wounds are truly evenly distributed, all over your body.”\n\n“Mm.”\n\nJust then, Doctor Lin walked back. She glanced at the old man standing by the car window and said to Zhou Ze:\n\n“Still no rooms.”\n\n“Where would there be rooms now?” the old man shook his head and said, “Never mind, come stay at my place. My house has a large courtyard.”\n\nDoctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze, asking for his opinion.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. In truth, he didn’t know why the old man would suddenly decide to help him. One must know, these days, if you don't have a fortune in the tens of millions, you truly wouldn't dare casually help people on the road.\n\nThe old man’s house was indeed very large, built in a style similar to a siheyuan**. And when Zhou Ze got out of the car, the old man helped Doctor Lin to assist Zhou Ze into a room.\n\nHis strength was quite considerable.\n\nAfter lying down in the room, the old man said he would go get some traditional Chinese medicine for Zhou Ze and then left.\n\nDoctor Lin sat beside Zhou Ze, also somewhat disbelieving that they could encounter such a kind-hearted person on the road who would bring the two of them back to his home.\n\n“There are still more good people in this world,” Doctor Lin sighed.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, looked at the photo frame hanging on the wall beside the bed. Inside, many medals and certificates were preserved, along with some group photos. Presumably, the old man must have been a soldier before.\n\n“Are you hungry?” Doctor Lin asked.\n\n“Not really,” Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“Young lady, can you cook?”\n\nThe old man walked in, carrying an ointment in his hand.\n\n“Yes, I can,” Doctor Lin replied.\n\n“Then you go make dinner. I’ll apply some medicinal plaster for him; it’s very effective for external injuries.”\n\nDoctor Lin glanced at Zhou Ze again. Evidently, she was still a bit uneasy about leaving him alone in the room.\n\nZhou Ze nodded at her, signaling her to go.\n\nThe old man sat down by Zhou Ze’s bed, patted the bedsheets, and said, “No need to be shy, no need for formalities, right?”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“Then take off your clothes. Never mind, I’ll help you.”\n\nThe old man reached out and helped Zhou Ze take off his upper garment. Looking at the dense injuries covering Zhou Ze’s body, he smacked his lips and said:\n\n“Tsk-tsk, back on the battlefield, injuries like yours were rare, you know.”\n\n“Old sir, were you a soldier before?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Yes, I was. I was still young when fighting the Japanese invaders, only knowing how to wield a red-tasseled spear. But when fighting Old Jiang, I formally enlisted. Then I went to Korea, and also to Southern Tibet. Lucky me, I didn't die, and wasn't really injured.”\n\n“Fortunate indeed.”\n\n“King Yama won’t take me, what can I do? Tell me, I still receive so many allowances every month, and I can't contribute anything to the country. Might as well let King Yama send a ghost messenger or something to take me away.”\n\n“…………” Zhou Ze.\n\n“Alright, it’s applied. Your frame, you look delicate, but to the touch, you’re quite sturdy. Good foundation, huh? A martial artist?”\n\n“Sort of,” Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n“Do you know why I brought you into my home?” the old man asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“I took a liking to you.”\n\n“That’s a good reason.”\n\n“When a person lives to my age, they can pretty much do whatever they please. Don’t want to worry or care so much anymore.”\n\nDinner was made by Doctor Lin, but Zhou Ze didn't eat much.\n\nAfter dinner, the old man invited Zhou Ze to play Chinese chess, while Doctor Lin went to the old man’s inner room, his collection room, to look at antiques.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, facing the chessboard. The old man moved a piece, Zhou Ze spoke a move, and the old man placed the piece for Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't very good at Chinese chess. The old man deliberately gave him a chariot***, never moving it, and they could still have a back-and-forth game.\n\nAs they played, it got dark. Zhou Ze received a call; it was from Bai Yingying.\n\nShe said Old Daoist encountered traffic police on his way driving here. Because he was driving without a license, both the car and he were impounded. The monkey had no choice but to hide in the nearby grass, not daring to let the police see it, otherwise the crime of privately keeping a nationally protected animal would add to Old Daoist’s charges.\n\nThis caught Zhou Ze somewhat off guard. He had originally thought Old Daoist would bring the monkey over sooner so he could heal better, but he didn't expect Old Daoist to get into trouble himself. Turns out not only did he himself not have a driver’s license, Old Daoist had also been driving without one all this time.\n\n“What happened?” the old man asked after Zhou Ze hung up the phone.\n\n“The friend coming to pick me up ran into some trouble on the way and might not be able to come tonight.”\n\n“If they can’t come, just stay here. I took a liking to you.”\n\n“…………” Zhou Ze.\n\nAfter finishing the chess game, the old man yawned, seeming ready for sleep. He waved at Zhou Ze, put away the chessboard, and said he was going back to his room to sleep.\n\nAfter the old man left, Doctor Lin walked in.\n\nHowever, her expression was a bit grave.\n\n“What’s wrong?”\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n“A'Ze, this old man, he’s a bit strange.”\n\n“What’s so strange about that? Didn’t you say he was very kind before?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Anyway, it just makes me uncomfortable. And this siheyuan also has something strange about it.”\n\n“It’s fine, I’m here,” Zhou Ze comforted her.\n\nDoctor Lin nodded, feeling a little more at ease.\n\nWho knew Zhou Ze hadn't finished speaking, and continued:\n\n“I’m here, but you know my current condition. If something happens, you must remember to carry me and run, don’t leave me behind.”\n\n“…………” Doctor Lin.\n\n“I’ll go get some hot water to wipe your body.”\n\nDoctor Lin got up and walked out. When she came out from the kitchen carrying hot water, she happened to see the room next to Zhou Ze’s, which seemed to be lit; that was the old man’s room.\n\nAs she got closer, she heard the sounds of drinking and finger-guessing games from inside, along with the old man’s voice, a clamor of human voices.\n\n“Little Li Zi, you have guests today, huh?”\n\n“Yeah, a girl and a boy.”\n\n“That girl looks really good, like the young lady of a landlord’s family.”\n\n“You secretly looked at her?”\n\n“What’s wrong with looking? It’s not like it’ll cost me anything.”\n\n“That man looks even better,” a voice suddenly said.\n\n“You punk, I’ve long felt something was off about you. So you really don’t like women, you prefer that sort.”\n\n“Like? I wouldn’t dare to like. It just depends on whether he likes us.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“If he doesn’t like it, then we won’t be able to drink wine, eat meat, or live this kind of life anymore.”\n\n---\n*   Lit. \"activated invincible mode,\" a gaming term implying being overwhelmingly powerful.\n**   A traditional Chinese residential compound with rooms surrounding a central courtyard.\n*** A \"chariot\" (車) is a piece in Chinese chess, equivalent to a rook in Western chess.",

    "content": "Lin Yisheng quickly entered Zhou Ze's room. This time, she was sure there was something wrong with this courtyard house. Before, there were only three people in the courtyard: herself, Zhou Ze, and the old man. Now, the old man's room next door suddenly had a large group of people drinking and chatting so boisterously at night. How was that possible?\n\nMoreover, the things they were saying clearly hinted at something.\n\n\"Ah Ze, there's something wrong with this courtyard. Let's leave.\"\n\nZhou Ze put down his phone and yawned. Honestly, he was indeed tired, but he couldn't sleep without Yingying by his side. It was most agonizing to need sleep both physically and mentally yet be unable to fall asleep.\n\n\"In the room next door, I just heard a lot of people talking,\" Lin Yisheng continued.\n\n\"It's nothing, it's nothing,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. \"You were startled yesterday. Just rest for a few more days, and you'll be fine.\"\n\nActually, after close contact with ghosts, living people inevitably get affected, somewhat like being infected with a similar magnetic field. They become able to see and hear things normally invisible. After a while, when the magnetic field dissipates, they'll be fine.\n\nOx tears* have a similar effect.\n\nLin Yisheng picked up a towel and helped Zhou Ze wipe his body. Zhou Ze certainly enjoyed it, but judging by her technique, Lin Yisheng's skill at tending to people was indeed not as good as Yingying's.\n\nAfter wiping him clean, Lin Yisheng put down the towel, bit her lip, and said: \"I didn't mishear. If you know what's going on and want me not to overthink it, I won't overthink it.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nLin Yisheng said nothing more, took off her jacket, and lay down on the bed, though she lay on her side, with her arm cradling her head.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's vantage point, he could only see her back, a slender yet curvaceous figure, very enticing.\n\nActually, women look better with a bit of flesh like this.\n\nZhou Ze continued to scroll on his phone. Since he couldn't sleep anyway, it was boring. He could only blame Laodao*, that unreliable guy. If Laodao were here now, with the monkey's help, his injuries would recover faster.\n\nThe old man's balm was indeed not bad; the wound still felt cool and soothing. But compared to the monkey's mud, it was still far inferior.\n\nLin Yisheng's breathing gradually became steady. It was unclear if she was asleep or not.\n\nBut slowly, the sounds from next door grew louder: the clamor of drinking games*, the boisterousness of bragging*, and even a man singing Huangmei Opera* in a high-pitched voice.\n\nIt felt as if someone had placed ten televisions next door, all playing different programs.\n\nZhou Ze saw Lin Yisheng's body stiffen on her side, one hand instinctively covering her ears.\n\nShe wasn't asleep,\n\nand trying to fall soundly asleep while having *those* things as neighbors was indeed too difficult for her.\n\nZhou Ze tapped the wooden board at the edge of the bed with the corner of his phone and rebuked:\n\n\"It's late at night, have some manners. Don't disturb other people's rest.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze shouted, the noise immediately subsided, and there was dead silence.\n\nZhou Ze continued playing on his phone.\n\nHe wasn't sure how long he played, but his phone was constantly plugged into the charging cable, so there was no fear of running out of power. It was around two in the morning.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hold it in any longer.\n\nHe had actually thought about it during the day,\n\nand had been holding it until now.\n\nHe glanced at Lin Yisheng beside him, who was still lying on her side. He reached out to prop himself up on the edge of the bed, preparing to get up, but his injuries were indeed a bit severe. Zhou Ze couldn't push himself up and lay back down with a groan.\n\nLin Yisheng turned around, looked at Zhou Ze, and directly asked:\n\n\"Need to use the toilet?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nLin Yisheng helped Zhou Ze out of bed, and they walked out of the room together.\n\nThere were no flush toilets in the courtyard house rooms. The toilet was located diagonally opposite, a separate small room, a rural-style pit toilet with a wooden frame on top for people to sit on, and a pit or a large jar below.\n\nActually, the old man didn't seem to lack money. His monthly allowance was probably considerable, and Lin Yisheng had once been invited to visit his collection room, which contained many excellent pieces. Selling just one or two of them outside could easily buy a house.\n\nZhou Ze held onto the wall with one hand. As he was about to unbuckle his belt with the other, Lin Yisheng directly reached out and unbuckled it for him.\n\nThis surprised Zhou Ze. At that moment, Lin Yisheng truly seemed like a wife tending to her sick husband; everything was so natural, without the slightest bit of affectation.\n\nZhou Ze let her, slowly closing his eyes, waiting for his \"water pipe\" to be taken out by a pair of soft hands, after which he would just need to open the \"floodgates\" and let the water flow. He figured that after he finished, his \"water pipe\" would likely be held and given a little shake.\n\nHowever,\n\njust then,\n\na very unfriendly voice came.\n\n\"Need help?\"\n\nIt was the old man's voice.\n\nThe old man had gotten up in the middle of the night to use the toilet.\n\nLin Yisheng had just squatted down to unbuckle Zhou Ze's belt. Hearing the voice, she looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to shout, \"Keep going!\" \"Don't stop!\"\n\nBut he gritted his teeth and pretended to be calm, saying, \"Let him do it.\"\n\nLin Yisheng looked at Zhou Ze with some concern.\n\n\"He can't possibly push me into the pit, can he?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"I know what's going on.\"\n\nLin Yisheng nodded and walked out of the toilet. The old man walked in.\n\n\"Well, what a coincidence. When you get old, you don't sleep soundly at night. Always getting up to pee, and that thing also has problems. Can't compare to you young folks, always frequent urination, urgent urination, incomplete urination.\"\n\nWith the old man's help, Zhou Ze finished. The old man supported Zhou Ze with his arm, turning his back to him, allowing Zhou Ze to free his hands to turn on the faucet himself, thus avoiding awkwardness.\n\nThe old man helped Zhou Ze out of the toilet. Lin Yisheng was waiting outside, ready to take over.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"You go back and rest. I'll go chat with the old gentleman in his room.\"\n\nThe old man paused, then nodded, saying, \"Alright.\"\n\nThis old man was similar to Laodao, speaking various regional dialects. Laodao had wandered all over the country in his youth, and the old man was probably similar, having followed the army to fight since he was very young, so his accent had naturally become mixed.\n\nEntering the old man's room, Zhou Ze found it a bit small because a large black curtain divided the room in half.\n\nZhou Ze only saw the old man's bed and a tea table; that was all that could fit in this area.\n\nThe old man settled Zhou Ze on the bed and brewed a pot of herbal tea for him.\n\n\"Pull back the curtain so I can see,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Nothing much to see. It's not suitable to look at these things late at night.\"\n\n\"I want to see,\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"Alright, if you want to see, I'll show you. Actually, there's nothing shameful about it.\"\n\nThe old man also seemed to get into the spirit, stood up, walked to the side of the black curtain, and then forcefully pulled it back.\n\nThe motion was a bit like a flag-bearer raising the national flag in Tian'anmen Square, pulling back the flag as it's raised.\n\nThe curtain was pulled back,\n\nrevealing a six-tiered platform, with each tier progressively higher. On the platform, ancestral tablets* were densely arranged.\n\nBeneath the stand was a table laden with offerings like aged yellow wine, cured meat, and two burning incense sticks.\n\n\"It's really lively,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old man was excited, rubbing his hands together excitedly, saying, \"I don't know why, but I just like the look of you, kid.\"\n\n(He) had said that many times today.\n\n\"I just wanted you to come to my home, sit for a bit, stay a while.\"\n\nThe old man picked up the yellow wine from the offering table, took a sip, smacked his lips, and his spirits soared even higher. He pointed at the tablets on the stand and said:\n\n\"Come, let me introduce you.\n\nThis is our Company Commander Chen. I was still young then, only knew to call him Company Commander Chen with everyone else. I don't know his full name. He sacrificed himself in '45, hit by a Japanese mountain cannon. We couldn't even collect all of his body. What a pity, the Japanese surrendered that very year, and he didn't live to see it.\n\nThis is Wang Gouzi, Zhao Sanquan, Wawazi. They were also in my squad, sacrificed during the advance into the Dabie Mountains when our regiment was responsible for rearguard resistance.\n\nThis is Zhou Zhou, Sun Decai, Qin Liangyou, sacrificed in the Huai'an Campaign. That battle, tsk tsk, it was brutal.\n\nThis is Zhao Peng, Sun Zhigang, Zhai Dazhuang, Ge Shufeng... They sacrificed themselves in Korea. Do you know about the American napalm bombs? When I went to look for them, they were all roasted. Damn it, even now I remember the smell of roasted human flesh. It made me not dare to eat meat for ten years afterward. Of course, back then, getting meat wasn't easy either.\n\nThis is Zhu Houquan, this is... \"\n\nThe old man rattled off many, many names in one breath, including where these people sacrificed themselves, and whether they were in his squad or company at the time. He described it all in great detail, meaning that he had always kept the information about his fallen comrades firmly in his heart, never forgetting it.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze sat on the edge of the bed,\n\nnodding continuously,\n\nfeeling a bit awkward because he was injured and couldn't get up.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had figured it out: the old man couldn't see them. He couldn't see that the room was actually packed with people.\n\nThey were either sitting on the floor, leaning against the walls, sitting by the table with offerings, or picking their ears, or reading some book, or dozing off.\n\nWhenever the old man introduced someone's name,\n\nthat person would look up, glance at Zhou Ze, and give a simple, honest smile, as if to acknowledge they had met and were acquainted.\n\nZhou Ze returned a smile and nodded.\n\nAfter the old man finished his introductions, his voice seemed a bit hoarse. He picked up the yellow wine from the table and took another sip.\n\n\"Satisfying! So, young man, are you scared?\n\nI'm telling you, with our formation here, even ghost envoys* wouldn't dare to step through this door!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe old man let out a long breath and sighed, \"Young man, I really damn well like the look of you!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Don't laugh when I say this, but just like I said during the day, I never chickened out during battles back then. I always charged at the front, but damn it, I just couldn't die. My comrades always fell around me. Sometimes, after a battle, I'd be the only one left in the whole squad.\n\nI don't understand why I never died and lived until now, and I'm living quite well. Just flipping some antiques or whatever, and the money comes in.\"\n\n\"A life of wealth and prosperity,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThis was truly a life of wealth and prosperity. If the old man hadn't become a soldier, if he had gone into business or done something else, he would surely have risen and soared to success.\n\n\"Heh heh, screw that 'life of wealth and prosperity'! I've understood it now. My comrades sacrificed themselves one by one, and I didn't die. It's Heaven's will that I live, to give them a home, so that after they sacrifice themselves, they can also have a place to gather.\n\nBefore, we couldn't afford wine or meat. Now conditions are better; we can eat meat, drink wine, sleep and snore without fear of marching the next day. My purpose in living, you see, is this.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old man, saying nothing.\n\nZhou Ze also looked at the room full of people. To be honest, this was the first time Boss Zhou hadn't looked at these ghosts with an eye for business.\n\n\"Don't laugh, but in recent years, I've gotten even older, and I don't sleep soundly anymore. So every night before bed, I'll have a little yellow wine to drink.\n\nHeh,\n\nit really works.\n\nEvery night after I fall asleep,\n\nI can dream of my old comrades. We all sit around the table, drinking, eating meat, and shooting the breeze.*\n\nIt's incredibly satisfying,\n\njust like they really live in my house!\"\n___\n*Translator's Note:\n*   **Ox tears (牛眼淚):** In Chinese folklore and supernatural belief, ox or cow tears are sometimes believed to grant the ability to see spirits or ghosts.\n*   **Laodao (老道):** Refers to an old Taoist priest, a character previously introduced. \"Unreliable guy\" (坑貨) implies he's a schemer or someone who causes trouble for others.\n*   **Drinking games (行酒令):** Traditional Chinese drinking games or feats often involving reciting poems, riddles, or performing tasks, with penalties (drinking) for failure.\n*   **Bragging (吹牛比):** A colloquial and somewhat crude term for boasting or exaggerating.\n*   **Huangmei Opera (黃梅戲):** A popular form of Chinese opera originating from Anhui province, known for its pleasant melodies and simple, direct storytelling.\n*   **Ancestral tablets (靈位):** Also known as spirit tablets, these are inscribed wooden plaques or stone tablets used in traditional Chinese ancestor worship to house the spirits of the deceased.\n*   **Ghost envoys (鬼差):** In Chinese mythology, these are beings from the underworld who are responsible for collecting the souls of the dead and escorting them to the afterlife.\n*   **Shooting the breeze (侃大山):** An idiom meaning to chat idly, converse informally, or talk nonsense.",

    "content": "Until he finally came out of the old man's room, Zhou Ze said nothing, only silently admiring in his heart that the old man was indeed born with a blessed fate. Living with dozens of departed souls, not only did nothing happen and he wasn't affected in the slightest, but his luck had also always been good.\n\nThis kind of destiny is beyond envy.\n\nZhou Ze also didn't ask if those military souls were willing to go to Hell. Perhaps, their obsession was simply because the old man was still alive, and the old man was willing to offer sacrifices to them. Plus their past camaraderie as comrades, which allowed them to gather in the old man's home, drinking wine together and chatting away every night as the old man fell asleep.\n\nIt was a very leisurely and peaceful life, and it didn't cause any impact on those around them. As a Ghost Messenger, he could completely let them be.\n\nIt's estimated that when the old man dies a natural death, his departed soul will truly join the ranks of his comrades. At that time, they will all descend to Hell together, and the road to the netherworld won't be lonely.\n\nJust like when they used to fight wars across the country, when they were together, they wouldn't feel afraid. It's just one road either way, just follow the flag.\n\nIf Zhou Ze were to forcibly take these military souls, the old man would also be greatly affected, almost completely severing the old man's original rhythm of life. Zhou Ze was truly worried the old man might suffer some mishap because of it.\n\nIn any case, the old man had at least sincerely helped him. If he were to harm him in return, it would be a bit indefensible.\n\nHowever, because of Zhou Ze's interruption, the gathering in the old man's room ended very quickly tonight, and no more sounds came from the room next door.\n\nPerhaps, those military souls themselves knew in their hearts that whether they could continue to stay here was actually just at Zhou Ze's discretion.\n\nAfter returning to the room, Doctor Lin helped Zhou Ze lie back down on the bed. She was still lying on her side, watching Zhou Ze. There had been a few twists and turns tonight. Zhou Ze couldn't sleep to begin with, and Doctor Lin hadn't slept very soundly either.\n\nReaching out, he took her hair and gently caressed it in his hand. Zhou Ze really enjoyed this feeling.\n\nUnrelated to kinship, unrelated to love, unrelated to responsibility. As long as a normal man has a beautiful woman lying next to him, even if you can't do anything, you'll still feel pleased.\n\n\"The experiences of these two days have been quite eventful,\" Doctor Lin spoke.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. For an ordinary person, accepting that her husband's soul had possessed a body was already very difficult, and she had also experienced a series of supernatural events. It was fortunate that Doctor Lin was very strong.\n\n\"Will I keep seeing those things?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"No, it'll be fine in a couple of days. After we go back, take some time off and rest well for a while.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded. She was always very obedient.\n\n\"How have you been doing lately?\"\n\n\"Quite well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"That's good then.\"\n\nDoctor Lin snuggled up to Zhou Ze, slowly closed her eyes, seemingly falling asleep again.\n\nZhou Ze still couldn't sleep. He simply took out the two Ghost Messenger IDs. The middle of these two IDs had started to turn pale and had clear creases, meaning they could at most withstand one more claim of ownership.\n\nTwo IDs, equivalent to having two official positions in hand. In the mortal world, those who could secure an official position could walk with their noses in the air. In the underworld, these two items were actually even more sought after.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze hadn't thought about how to use these items. He had originally thought of finding two from those dozens of military souls to inherit this, but thinking about it, it seemed impossible again.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze had some psychological hang-up, but purely because the conditions for inheriting a Ghost Messenger ID were indeed very strict. They had to be departed souls inhabiting a physical body.\n\nOrdinary departed souls, even if they could possess a person, it wasn't true \"soul possessing a body,\" and didn't meet the conditions.\n\nThose who could truly inherit this could only be Hell stowaways like himself, Tang Shi, and Liang Chuan. The purpose of this ID wasn't to grant you magical power or strength; in reality, it was only a symbolic function.\n\nIt could add luster, whitewash your gray identity, and that's all.\n\nJust like bandits who had fallen into brigandry in ancient times, once their power grew, they could accept an imperial amnesty and be granted official positions. An ordinary commoner wouldn't get to enjoy this kind of treatment.\n\nTherefore, these two IDs were actually like chicken ribs—tasteless to eat, a shame to discard.\n\nTo find similar Hell stowaways, how exceedingly difficult it was! Tang Shi once said that she had searched for half a year in the mortal world before finding Liang Chuan, and then found him.\n\nNow, all told, there were only three people.\n\nZhou Ze's fingertips were rubbing on the Ghost Messenger ID. Suddenly, Zhou Ze discovered that under the stimulation of his fingernail, the Ghost Messenger ID actually emitted a wisp of blue smoke.\n\nThe smoke smelled rather good, refreshing to the heart.\n\nThen Zhou Ze saw that the ID seemed a bit more worn than before, and he immediately stopped this behavior.\n\nThis was indeed too extravagant, more extravagant than smoking the highest-grade cigar.\n\nPutting down the ID booklet, Zhou Ze took out his phone, intending to get through the night. Tomorrow he would have Doctor Lin drive him back to the bookstore in Tongcheng. Xu Qinglang and the others should have started dealing with the old Taoist priest's matter, probably another large sum of joss paper money would have to be burned.\n\nFortunately, whether the old Taoist priest came back or not, it wasn't a big problem.\n\nThe key was to find that monkey.\n\nBut soon, Zhou Ze heard faint rustling movements coming from the courtyard wall, as if something was climbing over the wall.\n\nThe sound grew louder. It seemed there were quite a few things climbing over the wall. Gradually, this sound also woke Doctor Lin.\n\nDoctor Lin's sleep quality tonight was truly worrying. Every time she just fell asleep for a little while, she would be woken up.\n\nJust like how some people with spirit eyes also have trouble in their daily lives. When you can perceive things that ordinary people cannot, it is indeed a very bothersome matter.\n\nDoctor Lin's state would probably last for another day or two. She would only return to normal when the \"magnetic field\" on her body dissipated. And she also had to be careful not to catch a cold, otherwise she would easily fall ill.\n\n\"Outside, is there a sound?\" Doctor Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDoctor Lin thought it was the \"noisy\" people from next door again, but it wasn't. He could only blame Zhou Ze's itchy hands just now, who, at the cost of damaging the Ghost Messenger ID, made it emit a fragrance. This fragrance not only smelled very good to Zhou Ze, but also instinctively attracted some nearby wandering spirits.\n\nThis means business now. Zhou Ze thought of getting up and going outside to sign for a batch of deliveries.\n\nBut at this moment, from the room next door, the old man came out again. It seemed he was going to the toilet.\n\nWhen one gets old, the \"pipes\" tend to rust, drips and leaks are most common.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a bit worried. Although wandering spirits were mostly two or three scattered ones and couldn't cause any big trouble, the old man was old after all. If he were affected in any way, the consequences could be quite severe.\n\nIf the old man had stayed in his room, protected by that group of comrades, there would naturally be nothing to worry about. But now that he had come out, there would be a certain probability of something unexpected happening.\n\nMilitary souls were very different from ordinary departed souls. Their range of activity was actually not very large, and they strictly adhered to their \"discipline.\" The restrictions of this world on them were indeed stricter than on other departed souls.\n\nGeneral Chen Yi once wrote the poem \"To the netherworld to gather old troops, ten myriad banners to slay Yama.\"<sup>1</sup> But in reality, as a stability-maintaining institution of the Underworld authorities, it could tolerate you drifting about like wandering spirits, causing minor disturbances. But if you wanted to form a team and stir up trouble, then sorry, the Underworld authorities weren't to be trifled with.\n\nMoreover, when Zhou Ze entered the courtyard earlier, he didn't sense the presence of those military souls. It wasn't until he entered the old man's room and the old man lifted the curtain that he saw the room packed full of people. This meant that this group of military souls could only operate within the limited area of the room.\n\nIn any case, the ghosts were drawn by himself. He couldn't let the old man suffer for him.\n\n\"Help me up,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nDoctor Lin helped Zhou Ze out of bed.\n\nAs soon as the two reached the doorway, they heard a conversation outside.\n\nIt sounded like a man and a woman.\n\n\"In the room on the left, there are so many people, they look so fierce,\" the woman said.\n\n\"Yes, but they can't come out, don't be afraid, I'm here,\" the male ghost said.\n\n\"In the room on the right, it's like us, also a man and a woman, and the man seems to be injured,\" the woman added.\n\nDoctor Lin also heard the conversation, looking at Zhou Ze with some worry.\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, wasn't worried. He truly wished the other party would rush directly towards him, to save himself the trouble of having to run out again.\n\n\"No, that man is more terrifying than everyone in the left room combined. He makes my scalp tingle, don't provoke him.\"\n\nDoctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze with some surprise.\n\nZhou Ze slightly raised his head,\n\ncooperating with the rhythm of the male ghost showing off to his girlfriend.\n\nThis pair of ghost couple, they really know what's up.<sup>2</sup>\n\n\"Can't go left, can't go right. Then where is that fragrance coming from? There's only an old man over at the outhouse, maybe it's coming from him,\" the woman muttered.\n\n\"We can only try our luck with him. This courtyard house is too eerie, even more uncanny than our grave site.\"\n\nThe male and female ghosts seemed to have reached a consensus, preparing to make a move on the old man.\n\nIn reality, Zhou Ze had still underestimated the attraction of that fragrance to ghosts. This man and woman were clearly beings who had become ghosts for many years, almost having become refined spirits.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"ghostly cunning.\" This wasn't just a simple adjective; it was actually also a noun. Any entity, after cultivating to a certain degree, can become a spirit.\n\nThe old man had been drinking and was a bit tipsy. His hand kept reaching and reaching, but he just couldn't grasp his \"water pipe,\" which was very troublesome.\n\nThe male and female ghosts directly rushed into the outhouse.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze, supported by Doctor Lin, walked out of the room door, intending to go and solve the problem,\n\nonly to hear two terrified screams, one from the man and one from the woman:\n\n\"There's a ghost!\"\n\n\"There's a ghost! There's a ghost!\"\n\nThen, under Zhou Ze's gaze, the man and woman quickly rushed out through the courtyard walls and fled in panic.\n\nDoctor Lin was somewhat incredulous, even feeling a chill upon closer thought, and murmured:\n\n\"That old man, he's also a ghost?\"\n\nA ghost, walking alive and kicking on the road, and even led her and Zhou Ze back home? Eating with her, playing chess?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, correcting her:\n\n\"They weren't shouting 'there's a ghost' (有鬼, yǒu guǐ),\n\nbut 'there's a Noble One' (有貴, yǒu guì),\n\nthe 'noble' of a noble person (貴人).\"<sup>3</sup>\n\nA Noble One is here; gods and ghosts retreat.\n***\n<sup>1</sup> General Chen Yi (1901-1972) was a prominent Communist military commander and politician. The line \"此去泉台招舊部，旌旗十萬斬閻羅\" (cǐ qù quán tái zhāo jiù bù, jīng qí shí wàn zhǎn yán luó) is from his poem \"Wartime Spring Day\" (戰時春日). It literally translates to \"To the netherworld to gather old troops, ten myriad banners to slay Yama.\" It expresses a defiant spirit, implying that even in death, a powerful leader could command forces strong enough to challenge the King of Hell himself.\n\n<sup>2</sup> \"Know what's up\" (很有B數, hěn yǒu B shù) is internet slang meaning \"to know one's place,\" \"to be aware of one's limits,\" or \"to have a clear understanding of the situation.\"\n\n<sup>3</sup> This is a pun based on homophones in Mandarin Chinese. The ghosts shouted \"有鬼\" (yǒu guǐ), meaning \"there's a ghost.\" Zhou Ze corrected Doctor Lin, saying they shouted \"有貴\" (yǒu guì), meaning \"there's a noble/venerable one.\" The character \"貴\" (guì) means noble, expensive, or honorable, and is used in \"貴人\" (guìrén), meaning a noble person or a benefactor. The two words are pronounced identically (guǐ), creating the pun.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze suddenly felt that this old man was a treasure. A while ago, Old Daoist had talked with him about whether they should enshrine a God of Wealth or a Guan Gong statue in the bookstore.\n\nNow that he thought about it, why did they need to enshrine those idols? Just inviting this old man to live in the bookstore would ensure the bookstore's *feng shui* prosperity.\n\nZhou Ze had seen people of noble status before, but this old man's nobility was almost a bug.\n\nStill, as the saying went, he went to be a soldier. If he had pursued other professions, or if the grand historical background of his era had been different, he would surely have achieved extraordinary accomplishments.\n\nHowever, everyone's destiny is different, and their choices are different. Perhaps for the old man, choosing to be a soldier and fighting alongside his comrades was the choice he regretted the least.\n\nEven at the ripe old age of ninety, he could still happily reunite with his comrades \"in his dreams\" every night. In this life, he didn't feel he had lived unjustly, nor did he feel he had wasted his life by giving up other better things.\n\nThe old man had said he had no descendants, so if he left, he would truly be gone completely.\n\nPerhaps, his current continued existence was merely treating his home as an inn, a place for the comrades who sacrificed themselves years ago to gather.\n\nActually, from another perspective, Zhou Ze felt that the couplet hanging at his bookstore's entrance would be more suitable at the old man's doorstep.\n\n\"Listen if you wish; this is as I heard it.\"¹\n\nZhou Ze himself now found it difficult to achieve such a state. Especially after gaining achievements, he had become very pragmatic in his actions, losing his former lazy and leisurely nature.\n\nMeanwhile, the old man, in this courtyard house, was living by \"Who is first to awaken from the grand dream? All my life, I have known myself.\"²\n\nHe was unrestrained and natural, free from constraints. Though the courtyard house was small, his memories stretched far back.\n\nAfter that, everything remained quiet until dawn.\n\nIn the morning, Xu Qinglang drove to the place, Old Daoist was also in the passenger seat, and the monkey had been found.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze was helped into the car, Old Daoist lowered his head, feeling very embarrassed.\n\nHis boss was very weak after entering berserk mode,\n\nBut he, who was rushing to send mana and health, was actually pulled over by traffic police halfway for driving without a license.\n\nTo get him out this time, Xu Qinglang not only used some connections but also burned a lot of paper money. Even though Boss Zhou hadn't said anything, Old Daoist himself felt a pang of heartache.\n\n\"Old Daoist,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Yes, Boss,\" Old Daoist replied, casting a guilty glance at his boss sitting in the back.\n\n\"Let's go learn to drive together in a while, and get a driver's license.\"\n\n\"Uh... okay.\"\n\nActually, Zhou Ze and Old Daoist both knew how to drive, but Xu Le didn't have a license, and Old Daoist had never bothered to get one. If they really went to take the test, it would just be a formality.\n\nAlong the way, Xu Qinglang kept looking at Dr. Lin in the rearview mirror;\n\nWatching her wipe Zhou Ze's face, watching her peel fruit for Zhou Ze, watching her carefully ask Zhou Ze if he was uncomfortable anywhere.\n\nIn short, the entire car was filled with the scent of public displays of affection.³\n\nOld Daoist didn't care anyway; every one of his ghost bosses always had endless romantic luck⁴ when it came to women and female ghosts. This kind of thing couldn't be envied. If one wanted to envy it,\n\nOne had to die first.\n\nOld Daoist didn't want to die, so he was willing to endure the loneliness of being a bachelor. Zhou Ze used to ask him why he didn't find a partner and live a good life, and Old Daoist replied that he aspired to roam the world.\n\nIf he were to marry a boss, he would disappoint so many fallen women⁵ waiting for him to comfort them worldwide; it would truly be their loss. Therefore, he could only sacrifice himself to fulfill everyone else's needs.\n\nTwo hours later, Xu Qinglang parked the car in front of Dr. Lin's house.\n\nBefore Dr. Lin got out, she specifically said, \"I'll send the agreement again; just sign it and mail it back to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a little disappointed. Although the trip wasn't long, it had been quite eventful. However, the two of them, after all the twists and turns, seemed to have resumed their pre-departure rhythm.\n\nThe divorce agreement.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, didn't try to stop her, and didn't even say anything more. He just waved to her, reminding her to get good rest. After these meaningless pleasantries were over, Dr. Lin went upstairs and home. Xu Qinglang restarted the car, and twenty minutes later, they returned to the bookstore.\n\nOld Daoist got out first, taking the monkey to dig in the mud.\n\nXu Qinglang helped Zhou Ze open the car door, handed him a cigarette, and chuckled, \"If you're really interested, be a bit bolder.\"\n\n\"And then Dr. Lin thinks I'm good at it and specifically leaves me three thousand yuan on the nightstand?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Actually, this is quite good. I'm not a living person, and too much entanglement with me might not be good for her.\"\n\n\"It's not a romance drama; why so many twists and turns? To be honest, if the one who drove the Maserati that day wasn't the Faceless Woman but Dr. Lin, you two would probably be close to your delivery date by now.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that Xu Qinglang made a lot of sense, and he couldn't find words to refute him.\n\n\"Of course, if that doesn't work, IVF is very convenient now anyway, and the Lin family is rich. You can tell her parents that they've found a son-in-law who can't get it up, and if they want grandchildren, they'll have to do IVF. I reckon the Lin family would be quite willing to spend money on you.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang with some surprise,\n\nHe felt that Xu Qinglang had gone bad,\n\nOld Xu, who used to be so loyal and honest, had actually learned to retaliate, and right after Zhou Ze had just mocked him.\n\nTruly, morality is declining, and people's hearts are not as they once were.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to get out of the car with Xu Qinglang's help, but a white figure ran straight over, gently picked Zhou Ze up, and carried him into the bookstore, saying at the same time:\n\n\"Boss, the water temperature is all set.\"\n\nAfter Bai Yingying helped Zhou Ze bathe, she carried him upstairs to the bedroom. Tea and fruit were already prepared in the bedroom. Zhou Ze drank half a cup of tea. Yingying very thoughtfully offered her thigh as a pillow for Zhou Ze, and her hands massaged his head perfectly, allowing Zhou Ze to slowly fall asleep.\n\nThis,\n\nThis was life,\n\nThis,\n\nThis was what it meant to live.\n\nWhen he woke up, it was already night. He ate something with plum juice. Zhou Ze, supported by Bai Yingying, came downstairs and sat on the sofa.\n\nA moment later, Xu Qinglang also came downstairs. He was wearing a wine-red suit, his hair perfectly combed, and he seemed to have sprayed some perfume on himself.\n\n\"So flashy, where are you going?\" Zhou Ze asked, waving the newspaper in his hand.\n\n\"None of your business,\" Xu Qinglang said, rolling his eyes at Zhou Ze.\n\nThat glance perfectly expressed the idiom \"having an affair.\"\n\nHe straightened himself in the mirror again, then Xu Qinglang, feeling good about himself, asked Bai Yingying:\n\n\"How do I look in this outfit?\"\n\n\"Very handsome,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"Before this outfit, you were a streetwalker⁶ drifting in the night of Paris. After this outfit, you're the most expensive male escort⁷ in Modu⁸.\"\n\nZhou Ze finished speaking and took a sip of coffee.\n\n\"I didn't ask you,\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand dismissively at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"Someone who can't get it up has no right to talk so much.\"\n\nAs Xu Qinglang spoke, he looked at Bai Yingying and gave her a knowing look.\n\nBai Yingying blushed, crossing her hands and poking her fingers. Actually, the Boss's...\n\nXu Qinglang left, taking a taxi. A saucy aura seemed to linger in the bookstore.\n\nBai Yingying refilled Zhou Ze's coffee and said at the same time, \"Boss, Xiao Ke is still waiting for your reply regarding that Japanese priest.\"\n\n\"Tell her to keep an eye on it. I'm not feeling well lately.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded, indicating that she understood.\n\n...\n\nWhen he reached the door of the room,\n\nXu Qinglang hesitated,\n\nAt the same time, he had six thousand yuan in cash in his pocket.\n\nShe had contacted him again. He didn't want to come, but he felt there were some things that needed to be clarified.\n\nFor example, that he wasn't the male escort she mistook him for. So, he came, not only to return the three thousand yuan she had left him last time but also to give her another three thousand yuan.\n\nThen he would very seriously tell her,\n\n\"You're great,\"\n\n\"You satisfy me very much,\"\n\n\"Here's your service fee.\"\n\n*Phew*...\n\nA man,\n\nMust rise from wherever he was scorned.\n\nHe pressed the doorbell of the guest room.\n\nThe door opened,\n\nThe woman inside was graceful and poised. She must have just showered; without makeup, she was even more captivating. Her exposed skin gave one a demonic impulse.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nXu Qinglang cleared his throat. Just as he opened his mouth to say a word, his lips were sealed by another pair of lips,\n\nThen,\n\nHeavenly thunder ignited earthly fire,\n\nFriction generated heat, creating a blazing inferno.\n\nEverything proceeded naturally,\n\nThen,\n\nThey went at it thoroughly.\n\nAfter three rounds,\n\nXu Qinglang didn't fall asleep. Although he was very, very tired, like an old ox whose strength had been exhausted from plowing, he still forced himself to open his eyes.\n\nReaching for his clothes, he was going to give money. This time, he would give the money first!\n\nDignity,\n\nHe couldn't forget his dignity!\n\nA man with over twenty apartments,\n\nMust have his own dignity!\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nThe woman asked, lying on the bed with a thin cigarette between her fingers.\n\n\"Giving money.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was unbuttoning his suit pocket.\n\n\"Wham!\"\n\nA stack of money was pulled out from under the pillow by the woman and tossed in front of Xu Qinglang,\n\nEasily tens of thousands.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned,\n\nHe suddenly felt that the few thousand yuan in his pocket,\n\nSeemed a bit too little to offer,\n\nHis dignity seemed to have been trampled upon once more, full of holes.\n\n\"I'm very satisfied with you, extremely satisfied,\" the woman said.\n\n\"I'm also very satisfied with you,\" Xu Qinglang said, not showing any weakness.\n\n\"Satisfied with my price, right?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang regained his composure, folded the money on the bed, grabbed the woman's hand, and put the money back into her hand.\n\n\"I don't want your money, and I'm not... Hmm? Your wrist?\"\n\nHe hadn't noticed last time,\n\nNor during the three times just now,\n\nNow Xu Qinglang noticed,\n\nOn the woman's left wrist, there were actually twenty dense scars. A few of the scars had just appeared and hadn't fully healed yet.\n\n\"Every time I make love with a man who satisfies me, I feel very pleased. When I'm pleased, I want to leave something to commemorate it, something to remind me of this joyful and wonderful time today.\n\nLike today.\"\n\nThe woman's right hand produced a razor blade from somewhere,\n\nRight in front of Xu Qinglang,\n\n\"Pfft,\"\n\nA sound,\n\nA fresh red cut appeared,\n\nThe woman lifted her head,\n\nOpened her mouth,\n\nAnd kept sucking in cold air,\n\nShe must have been in great pain, but her expression seemed utterly delighted, like someone taking drugs⁹ finally getting what they wanted.\n\nThen,\n\nThe woman took the still-burning cigarette butt and directly pressed it onto the new scar.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe woman took a deep breath,\n\nThen exclaimed:\n\n\"Comfortable...\"\n___\n¹ A couplet from Buddhist sutras, often used to mean \"take it with a grain of salt\" or \"this is merely what I've heard.\"\n² A line from a famous poem/song attributed to Zhuge Liang, a strategist from the Three Kingdoms period.

    "content": "Xu Qinglang felt a scalp-tingling sensation at this moment. He had seen many ghosts and wasn't afraid of them. But the living person right in front of him, who had just been intimate with him^1, gave him a horror so profound he couldn't speak.\n\nThe woman glanced at him, and seeing his frightened look, seemed to find it more amusing. She reached out and lightly tapped his chin.\n\n\"So cute, like a lovable little quail.\"\n\nThe woman's fingers were somewhat cold. Xu Qinglang shivered, immediately put on his clothes and got out of bed. He didn't even dare to look at the woman, left the money on the bed without picking it up, and fled out the door as if escaping.\n\nCompared to the last time he woke up and found three thousand yuan more on the nightstand, Xu Qinglang felt that today he was even more of a failure than before.\n\nHe felt a bit lost. After leaving the hotel, he squatted alone on the curb and lit a cigarette.\n\nThis woman has mental problems.\n\nBut if you didn't look at her scarred wrist, she was truly beautiful.\n\nIt seemed there was no absolutely perfect thing in this world. God always habitually created a small flaw in beautiful things, as if that was what suited God's aesthetic.\n\nFor most men, it seemed like a very pleasant thing for a beautiful and respectable woman who was willing to give you money and had high skills in bed to become your friends-with-benefits^2.\n\nIn fact, Xu Qinglang had more or less harbored such thoughts before—the kind of uninhibited pursuit of fleeting pleasure that had no impact on one's life or personal affairs, enough to make one drop all defenses and willingly sink into it.\n\nReaching out, he ran his hand through his hair. Xu Qinglang felt a bit pained.\n\nJust then, a pair of high heels appeared behind Xu Qinglang. He turned his head and saw the woman.\n\nThe woman was still smoking, her wrist wrapped in her sleeve, showing no flaws. She bent down and looked at Xu Qinglang, her cleavage so unfathomably deep it was enough to make most men's eyes irresistibly fixated.\n\n\"Little brother, was elder sister too scary?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, avoiding her gaze, and continued smoking his cigarette.\n\n\"Then I'll leave. Let's arrange something next time I'm in a good mood. Oh, and this is your money.\"\n\nThe woman took money out of her bag.\n\n\"I don't want it. I'm not short on money.\"\n\nThe woman paused, as if looking at a stubborn baby, and said:\n\n\"What a coincidence, neither am I.\"\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nThe woman directly threw the tens of thousands of yuan in cash into the air. The banknotes began to flutter, attracting the gaze of many passersby around. Then she got into the car parked beside her and drove away.\n\nXu Qinglang sat amidst the fluttering banknotes, which made him involuntarily recall a scene from the \"God of Gamblers\" movie he watched as a child.\n\nIt also involved throwing money into the air, and then Brother Fa and a woman danced gracefully in the rain of banknotes.\n\nHe sniffed, and Xu Qinglang silently stood up.\n\nHe took a few steps away,\n\nThen stopped,\n\nAnd looked back. There was a pile of money on the ground.\n\nHeh,\n\nAm I short on money?\n\nHe turned his head back and continued walking forward.\n\nJust then, several passersby on the road, seeing Xu Qinglang leave, instinctively started to gather, intending to pick up the money.\n\nXu Qinglang stopped again,\n\nAnd quickly walked back to where he was.\n\n\"I'm not short, but that guy is. If he knew I didn't even want the money on the ground for a bit of so-called face, he'd definitely scold me to death!\"\n\n***\n\n\"Achoo!\"\n\nIn the bookstore, Boss Zhou, who had been reading newspapers for half the night, let out a loud sneeze.\n\n\"Boss, do you have a cold?\" Bai Yingying asked with some concern.\n\n\"Heh, someone must be thinking of him.\" The Old Taoist pinched his fingers to calculate nearby. \"Tsk tsk tsk, it must be so.\"\n\n\"The floor's a bit dirty, it needs another mop.\" Zhou Ze said slowly.\n\nThe Old Taoist immediately pulled a long face, bitterly picked up the mop, and started cleaning.\n\nJust then, a Porsche stopped outside the bookstore. A woman dressed lavishly and exquisitely walked in. The woman was about thirty-something, exuding an air of elegance from head to toe.\n\n\"Wow, she's so beautiful, truly like a lotus emerging from water,\" Bai Yingying exclaimed from the side.\n\nThis was normal, because the woman was indeed beautiful, the type that grew more charming the more you looked at her.\n\n\"The dew on the lotus hasn't been wiped off yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nThe woman's cheeks carried spring, her eyes held water, and her body exuded a loose languidness, like the earth just nourished by spring rain, nurturing new life.\n\n\"Who's the boss?\"\n\nThe woman looked around and asked.\n\nZhou Ze frowned. Who's the boss?\n\nWould the high school girl holding coffee nearby be the boss?\n\nWould the old farmer grunting and mopping the floor with a mop be the boss?\n\nThere were only three people in the shop,\n\nWho's the boss?\n\nAre you blind?\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips and ignored her. Anyway, you're a living person, not a ghost.\n\nAs a result, no one actually paid attention to the woman.\n\nBai Yingying went to tidy the counter, and the Old Taoist continued mopping.\n\nZhou Ze continued to lie on the sofa in a Ge You Slouch^3.\n\n\"I have something, I'm looking for your boss. Wang Ke introduced me.\"\n\nAt the mention of Wang Ke, Zhou Ze slowly sat up straight.\n\nThe woman saw Zhou Ze, walked over, and sat on the sofa opposite him.\n\nShe spoke directly:\n\n\"My husband has recently encountered some psychological problems. He always thinks he sees ghosts. I consulted Dr. Wang, and Dr. Wang recommended me to come here to find you. He said you're an expert in this field.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer the woman. Instead, he took out his phone, preparing to scold Wang Ke. Back then, they had agreed not to bring trouble to his side, but now Wang Ke had pushed another troublesome matter onto him.\n\nSo, his previous promise was just bullshit?\n\nThere's also a limit to helping and caring for friends. After all, Zhou Ze never considered himself a living Lei Feng^4.\n\nBefore he even finished dialing,\n\nThe woman tossed a bank card onto the coffee table.\n\n\"There's a million in this card, the password is 003003.\"\n\nZhou Ze's progress in calling Wang Ke to hold him accountable was interrupted. Zhou Ze felt furious. Didn't she see he was about to make a call?\n\nWhat's the meaning of you throwing a card on the coffee table, saying there's a million in it, and even announcing the password?\n\nDon't you know that a random burial object thrown out by my maid is worth hundreds of thousands?\n\nDon't you know that the old man mopping my floor can casually start a livestream selling hell money and his income will skyrocket in minutes?\n\nDidn't you see that the cook I hired owns over twenty apartments?\n\nZhou Ze put down his phone,\n\nReached out,\n\nAnd picked up the card.\n\nSigh,\n\nHe was still too kind-hearted, too focused on friendship.\n\nHe still had to help his friends.\n\n\"This is a deposit.\"\n\nThe woman added.\n\nZhou Ze's hand twitched.\n\nSigh, his injury still wasn't fully healed, his body was just a bit weak. His hand started trembling just from picking up a small card.\n\n\"Yingying, a guest has arrived, why haven't you served coffee?\" Zhou Ze shouted unhappily towards the counter.\n\n\"Coming!\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately brought the coffee over.\n\nThe woman calmly looked at Zhou Ze. She thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of beating people into submission with money.\n\nWhether in bed or out of bed, whether with men or women, the money in her hand always worked wonders for her.\n\n\"Tell me about your situation. How old is your husband?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He's ninety-three this year,\" the woman replied.\n\nZhou Ze, somewhat surprised, took another look at the woman.\n\n\"Yes, I got together with him precisely because I was after his money and inheritance. Then I told him we had true love, and the old man, feeling good about himself, believed it.\"\n\nThe woman said, still very calmly.\n\n\"Thank you for your honesty.\"\n\n\"Even if I weren't honest, you'd still think that way.\"\n\nThe woman picked up the coffee, took a sip, and frowned slightly.\n\n\"No sugar.\"\n\n\"I don't like sugar,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman put down the coffee. \"Anyway, whenever you have time, you can come to my house and see my husband. He's been too paranoid lately, to the point where our normal marital life can't even proceed.\"\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nZhou Ze, who was drinking coffee, choked.\n\nBai Yingying carefully wiped her boss's mouth with a tissue, then stepped back.\n\n\"Pardon my bluntness, but I think you should be hoping he kicks the bucket sooner.\"\n\n\"Well, he was almost dead before, practically bedridden. But ever since he started claiming to see ghosts, his spirits have been noticeably much better than before.\"\n\nThe woman continued, looking a bit distressed:\n\n\"At this rate, I don't think he'll die anytime soon. I'm talking about natural death.\"\n\n\"I understand. So, what's your intention in hiring me?\"\n\n\"To resolve his current state. I don't care if it's a psychiatric version of senile dementia or if there are really ghosts haunting him. I want him to return to normal, and then continue to lie in bed quietly waiting to die, just like before.\"\n\n\"Alright, I agree. I will do my best to cure your husband's illness.\"\n\nA cold smile appeared at the corner of the woman's mouth,\n\n\"Hypocrite.\"\n\n\"By the way, has your husband mentioned who's haunting him?\n\nI mean, what's the identity of the ghosts haunting him?\n\nDoes he know them?\"\n\n\"His ex-wife, his son, his daughter, his grandson, his granddaughter, and his great-grandson, great-granddaughter.\"\n\nThe woman counted on her fingers,\n\n\"Many, many people.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, are they already...?\"\n\n\"Five years ago, their large family held a gathering on a cruise ship. Then they encountered an accident, the cruise ship sank, and no one on board survived. That is to say, his entire family, except for him who happened to be ashore that day for business, all perished.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nLooking at it this way, it's very possible that the old man is either being tormented by spirits or suffering from psychological problems due to excessive stress.\n\n\"So, how long have you been married to him?\"\n\n\"Five years.\"\n\nThe woman replied, still very calmly.\n\nZhou Ze didn't continue asking questions, his hand constantly weighing the bank card.\n\nThis was murky water—no, it was likely a cesspit.\n\nIf he walked into it, he might get himself dirty; at the very least, he'd smell something foul.\n\n\"A million deposit, five million upon completion.\" The woman looked at Zhou Ze, her smooth fingers lightly touching the back of Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nBai Yingying, watching from the side, pouted. So old, and still trying to seduce men!\n\nYingying didn't consider that, in terms of age, everyone else in the bookstore, including the Old Taoist, combined wouldn't be as old as she was alone.\n\n\"Plus, I'll sleep with you three times.\"\n\nBai Yingying's expression turned even uglier.\n\nBloody hell!^5\n\nShameless!\n\nZhou Ze calmly moved the woman's hand away,\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"How about we cancel the latter condition and make it eight million?\"\n\n---\nFootnotes:\n^1: \"共赴巫山雲雨\" (gong fu Wushan yunyu): A classical Chinese idiom referring to sexual intercourse, originating from a Tang dynasty poem describing a king's dream encounter with a goddess at Mount Wu, who left him after enjoying \"clouds and rain.\"\n^2: \"P友\" (P-you): Short for \"pao you\" (炮友), literally \"cannon friend,\" a slang term for \"friends with benefits\" or a \"fuck buddy.\"\n^3: \"葛優躺\" (Ge You Slouch): A popular internet meme and posture originating from a scene in the 1993 Chinese TV series \"I Love My Family,\" where actor Ge You is shown slumping in a chair with a dejected expression.

    "content": "The woman gave him a business card, set a time, and provided an address, meaning she wanted Zhou Ze to visit her home tomorrow at noon.\n\nAs soon as the woman left, Bai Yingying stood next to Zhou Ze and said timidly:\n\n“Boss, tomorrow, can Old Taoist watch the shop? I’ll go with you.”\n\n“Hmm? What’s wrong?”\n\n“Look at you, Boss, you’re still injured. Old Taoist’s skills are fine against regular people, but against ghosts, he’s got no other trick besides touching his crotch*. It’s unsafe to bring him; bring me instead.”\n\n“…………” The floor-mopping Old Taoist.\n\n“Alright.” Zhou Ze nodded in agreement. Actually, judging from how Bai Yingying single-handedly crushed that corpse wraith last time, her combat power was indeed very strong.\n\n“It’s fine, Boss. You know he has issues in *that* area, so what are you worried about?\n\nAlthough a million to sleep with a woman once is indeed too expensive, for a top-tier one like that, a million wouldn’t be a loss. Look, even this boss gave up.”\n\nOld Taoist finished mopping, wiped his sweat, and comforted Bai Yingying.\n\nAlthough Old Taoist hadn’t settled down or gotten married, had he never seen a pig run, even if he hadn’t eaten pork**?\n\n“Old Taoist,” Zhou Ze called out, picking up his coffee.\n\n“Present, Boss, what’s up?”\n\n“The floor’s dirty.”\n\n“Dirty? No way, I just mopped it!”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nZhou Ze gently tilted the coffee cup in his hand, and the coffee spilled out, splashing onto the floor.\n\n“It’s dirty now. Mop it again.”\n\n“…………” Old Taoist.\n\nIn the latter half of the night, Zhou Ze went up to rest. Xu Qinglang only returned near morning, completely drunk, and went straight to his room on the second floor after returning to the bookstore.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze woke up the next morning, Xu Qinglang still hadn’t emerged from his room.\n\n“Where is he?”\n\nZhou Ze looked at the takeout breakfast in front of him, knowing at a glance that the household chef had skipped work.\n\n“He got drunk yesterday and isn’t up yet; he reeked of alcohol when he came back,” Old Taoist explained.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, saying nothing more.\n\nAfter breakfast, Zhou Ze changed into casual clothes, then turned his head and called out to Bai Yingying:\n\n“Bring me my crutch.”\n\nBai Yingying and Old Taoist were arguing about something behind the counter. Hearing Zhou Ze call her, she immediately ran over with the crutch, then frantically winked at Old Taoist.\n\n“What’s wrong?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Nothing, I just told Old Taoist to remember to wake Old Xu up for dinner tonight. Boss, you’re still recovering from injuries; takeout isn’t nutritious.”\n\n“It’s fine.”\n\nLeaning on his crutch, supported by Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze walked out of the bookstore and left by taxi.\n\nMeanwhile, Old Taoist, standing behind the counter, scratched his head helplessly and pulled out an electric wheelchair.\n\nTo curry favor*** with the boss, he had immediately ordered this electric wheelchair after the boss single-handedly wreaked havoc**** in Yancheng last time. He had just been thinking of giving it to the boss as a surprise gift.\n\nWho knew that zombie insisted on not letting him present it, even saying he might die if he did.\n\nOh dear,\n\nThis female zombie is really getting more and more jealous now. This humble Taoist is a man; could I possibly be vying for favor with you?\n\nShe even dared to threaten to kill me.\n\nThinking this, Old Taoist helplessly reached out and pressed a button on the wheelchair.\n\nThe wheelchair began playing music:\n\n“Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh... Little little boy, carrying a satchel to school…………”\n\nWhile playing music, the wheelchair automatically started moving, spinning in circles on the spot.\n\nVery cheerful, very cheerful.\n\n“Let’s give it to the boss when he gets back tonight.”\n\n………………\n\nArriving at the address by taxi, Zhou Ze was somewhat surprised that what met his eyes was not a mansion, but a rural residence.\n\nIt was a three-story house with its own courtyard wall. While such a house offered spaciousness and freedom, it wasn’t actually expensive, at least not compared to the woman’s casual gesture of dropping a card worth a million. Living here seemed somewhat incongruous.\n\nHe pressed the doorbell.\n\nA woman wearing house clothes and an apron walked out. After she opened the door, Zhou Ze realized that this woman, who looked even more like a respectable woman***** than a respectable woman, was the one who had come to his bookstore yesterday.\n\nClothes make the man, or in this case, the woman. At least in terms of demeanor, the woman now looked completely different from yesterday.\n\n“Please come in.”\n\nThe woman slightly bowed her head, gesturing for Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying to enter, then closed the door.\n\n“After my husband fell ill, he insisted on living here. This used to be his old home, treated as an ancestral residence. It hadn’t been lived in for decades, then a few years ago, it was renovated and this house was rebuilt.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded, entering the hall. The layout of the hall was also very ordinary, just like a regular home. On the south-facing wall hung a divine image, but Zhou Ze didn’t recognize who it depicted.\n\nIncense and candles were placed there, along with a table.\n\n“My husband is on the second floor. Please follow me.”\n\nThe woman was meek and obedient, as if this was her image at home, a perfect, good homemaker.\n\nBai Yingying kept staring at her. Although she had confidence in her boss,\n\nbut,\n\nHeh, men!\n\nThey went up the stairs to the second floor. As soon as he pushed open the balcony door, Zhou Ze saw the balcony corridor covered in talismans, of all kinds.\n\nBai Yingying subconsciously took a step back. Zhou Ze shook his head, signaling her not to be afraid.\n\nThese talismans were all for show.\n\nWalking further in, the door to the second room was pushed open. Zhou Ze saw it was a tatami-style room, and an old man with white hair, just skin and bones, sat there, mumbling to himself, as if chatting and talking with someone.\n\nZhou Ze also noticed one thing: from the main entrance, no, to be precise, from the road outside the main entrance all the way to every corner of this house, there were surveillance cameras.\n\nPresumably, even the bathrooms were the same.\n\nTherefore, in this place, the woman had to keep up the act. The old man must have had contingency plans for his inheritance; wealthy people weren’t usually too foolish.\n\nZhou Ze sat down next to the old man, reached for a bottle of red wine nearby, poured a glass, and took a sip.\n\nIt tasted good; he was someone who knew how to enjoy himself.\n\nThe old man seemed to be “playing” with his great-grandchildren, constantly uttering words to tease children and telling them stories.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back and listened. From the current situation, the old man seemed to have mental issues, as Zhou Ze didn’t see any ghosts in the room.\n\nBai Yingying stood at the doorway, then after a while felt a bit bored and walked out onto the balcony, looking at the rural scenery outside.\n\nThe woman brought over some pastries and presented them to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn’t need them, then clapped his hands and called out:\n\n“Old man, this must be your great-grandson, right?”\n\n“Huh?” The old man’s eyes were somewhat cloudy, but within that cloudiness, there was an unusual excitement.\n\nThe woman had previously said that her husband was bedridden, just waiting for him to pass so she could receive the inheritance. Now, however, the old man was sometimes delirious, sometimes perfectly normal, but his vitality was getting better day by day. He could eat, move, and get out of bed. They said it was a deathbed rally******, but wasn’t it lasting too long?\n\n“Yes, my great-grandson. Come, Junjun, say hello to this uncle.”\n\nThe old man gestured for the “great-grandson” in front of him to come over.\n\n“Ah, so well-behaved.”\n\nZhou Ze praised, even though he hadn’t seen a thing.\n\nNext,\n\nit was Boss Zhou and the old man’s chat time. The old man talked about his business, recounting how he started in middle age and how he later improved his family’s life.\n\nZhou Ze hadn’t understood much at first, but later learned that the old man’s ancestral home was Tongcheng, but when he was young, he had smuggled himself into Southeast Asia and made his fortune there. Later, after the Reform and Opening Up, he returned, cut off his former smuggling business, laundered his identity, and became a returned overseas Chinese investing in the country.\n\nTo be honest, this old man was quite a minor legend; his rags-to-riches story could even be written as an inspirational self-help autobiography.\n\nZhou Ze listened with interest. The old man even had his great-granddaughter and great-grandson recite ancient poetry and sing. Zhou Ze still didn’t see a thing, but he clapped and cheered nonetheless.\n\nThe entire process was somewhat like how those young celebrities******* make movies using digital compositing********, where a stand-in acts on set, and then their face is pasted on in post-production.\n\nAs they chatted, the woman returned.\n\n“Husband, Mr. Zhou, lunch is ready. We can eat now.”\n\nHearing this, the old man suddenly lost his previous amiability and became fierce. This ferocity looked somewhat like bluster hiding fear*********, and he shouted, utterly terrified:\n\n“They’re all downstairs, they’re all downstairs! I’m not going, I’m not going! They’re all waiting for me downstairs!”\n\nAs the old man shouted, he curled up on the tatami, looking utterly terrified, like a baby who’s very scared.\n\nThe woman looked somewhat helpless, turning to Zhou Ze and gesturing for him to come down for a meal.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and bid the old man farewell.\n\nJust as he was about to leave, the old man clutched his hand.\n\nThe old man said very seriously, “Don’t go down! They’re down there, they’re down there! They were sent back by the Dragon King of the Sea, and they’ll eat you! Really, if you go down, you’ll lose your life!”\n\n“Mmm, don’t worry, I’m here from Sun Wukong to return the Golden Cudgel. Relax.”\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the old man’s shoulder. While the old man was still chewing on his last words, Zhou Ze slipped away.\n\nThe three of them walked together from the balcony towards the staircase.\n\nThe woman quietly asked, “Is there a way to treat him?”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and said, “Let Wang Ke take a look. This old man probably has psychological issues or a rare form of senile dementia. There are no ghosts around him.”\n\n“Then there’s no need to return the deposit. Please have lunch before you go. I’m more skilled at French and Japanese cuisine; my Chinese cooking is only average.”\n\nIf there were ghosts, Zhou Ze would have seen them.\n\nIt’s a pity; this business deal can’t be done.\n\n“Come back! Come back!”\n\nThe old man suddenly stood at the room’s doorway and shouted.\n\nZhou Ze glanced back, then continued walking downstairs with the woman.\n\n“Then there’s no need to return the deposit. Please have lunch before you go. I’m more skilled at French and Japanese cuisine; my Chinese cooking is only average,” the woman said modestly.\n\nDown the stairs, they reached the hall. Frankly, Zhou Ze really wanted to taste the woman’s cooking.\n\nSo, to marry into a wealthy family and achieve the status of an old husband and young wife, it’s truly difficult without real capability; this path is not easy.\n\nIf you just lie in your dorm bed watching TV and fantasizing, it will basically remain just a fantasy forever.\n\nHowever,\n\nwhen Zhou Ze turned into the living room,\n\nhe froze.\n\nBai Yingying, behind him, also froze.\n\nAround the table in the hall,\n\npeople were seated everywhere,\n\nold and young, male and female, four generations gathered.\n\nThe entire family was sitting there, neatly arranged.\n\nEveryone was staring at the rice bowls in front of them, with a pair of chopsticks stuck upright********** in each bowl.\n\nAt the same time,\n\neveryone was soaked wet,\n\nwater droplets intermittently dripping from their chins and clothing hems,\n\nthe living room floor was already wet,\n\nas if it had just been mopped.\n\n---\n* A Chinese idiom implying cowardice or being so scared one loses control of bodily functions.\n** A Chinese idiom meaning one might not have experienced something directly, but they have enough observational knowledge to understand it.\n*** Literally, \"pat the boss's horse's butt,\" meaning to flatter or gain favor through subservience.\n**** A gaming term (開無雙) implying fighting against overwhelming odds and winning easily, like in the Dynasty Warriors game series.\n***** Refers to a virtuous, well-behaved woman from a good family.\n****** A temporary, often unexpected, improvement in a patient's condition shortly before death.\n******* (小鮮肉) Literally \"little fresh meat,\" a popular term referring to young, handsome male idol actors.\n******** (摳圖) A technique like chroma key or greenscreen, where elements of an image are combined from different sources.\n********* (色內厲荏) An idiom describing someone who appears fierce or aggressive on the outside but is timid or cowardly on the inside.\n********** In Chinese culture, sticking chopsticks vertically into a bowl of rice resembles incense offerings at a funeral, making it a highly inauspicious gesture.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze's lips parted slightly, then he subconsciously grabbed the woman who was still walking forward.\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze with some surprise, unsure of his intentions.\n\n\"I take back what I just said.\"\n\nZhou Ze gently twisted his neck,\n\n\"Your house, it's truly unclean.\"\n\nA contemplative look appeared on the woman's face.\n\n\"Don't worry, I'm not some charlatan.\"\n\n\"I believe you're not a charlatan,\" the woman said very seriously. \"Besides, it's only a few million; being scammed a little wouldn't matter anyway.\"\n\nThat remark,\n\nthat really stung,\n\nso jarring.\n\nA few million is like a few hundred, just to buy peace of mind?\n\nProdigal wife.\n\nZhou Ze inwardly mourned for the old man upstairs. What was the point of all that trouble at his age? All the family fortune he'd painstakingly built up, just falling into this woman's hands?\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze still had some professional ethics; it was this woman who hired him, so he wouldn't stir up more trouble.\n\nOf course, in Bai Yingying's eyes, Zhou Ze and this woman at that moment truly seemed to be colluding in villainy, a living, breathing, modern-day Wu Dalang and Pan Jinlian.*\n\nIf this were made into a TV series, the boss and this woman would be typical villains!\n\n\"Your husband, he's not mentally unstable; there truly are unclean things here. Let's not discuss money for now; we can talk about it slowly after I've dealt with this situation.\n\nYingying, take her upstairs.\"\n\n\"Boss, you alone...\" Bai Yingying didn't want to go up; the boss was injured at the moment.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to poke his maid's forehead with his middle finger at that moment. It didn't matter if something happened to him, but if anything happened to this woman, who would he get his final payment from?\n\nThe woman was very obedient; even though she couldn't see anything, she at least displayed an attitude of \"I believe,\" actively stepping back.\n\nWhat a truly intelligent woman, sensible, capable of changing her demeanor, a wanton in bed, a lady outside, able to cook, able to act, and even able to feign understanding.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Bai Yingying again. Ah, his own Yingying still had much to learn.\n\nUnder Zhou Ze's stern gaze, Bai Yingying could only accompany the woman upstairs; she needed to protect both this woman and the old man.\n\nNext, the entire hall was left with only that family and Zhou Ze.\n\nThese people maintained upright postures, sitting ramrod straight like elementary school students in class, even the oldest woman among them.\n\nThat old woman must have been the old man's original wife upstairs.\n\nNormally, even if a deceased relative's soul lingered and returned for a visit, it would be one or two at most. But this old man, good heavens, had his entire family—four generations living under one roof. Zhou Ze counted, and there were actually twenty-odd people.\n\nThe scale of the visitation party was indeed massive; no wonder the old man was so terrified.\n\nIf it were just his old wife, or a child, or a granddaughter returning, that might still be acceptable. But for the entire family to return together, anyone would be scared witless.\n\nLeaning on his crutch, Zhou Ze approached them. The closer he got, the more clearly Zhou Ze perceived a constant onslaught of icy coldness, and the surrounding air carried a rich, salty dampness.\n\nThis old man's family, it was said, had perished at sea due to a cruise ship accident. As for whether there was any inside story, Zhou Ze didn't know, nor did he want to know.\n\nAnyway, this family before him, by calculation, represented a considerable performance credit, and he could just collect them.\n\n\"Gurgle...\"\n\n\"Gurgle...\"\n\nWater sounds began to emanate from all around,\n\nThe water sounds came from their necks. From the old woman to children just a few years old, their necks were distended, like bloated frogs.\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nIn the hall, everyone began to vomit.\n\nTurbid, sandy seawater spewed from their mouths, along with some dead fish and shrimp!\n\nPreviously, the hall had only looked as if it had just been mopped,\n\nbut now,\n\nit resembled a seafood market, reeking of strong fishy odors, like a love hotel room that hadn't had its sheets changed after a month of continuous use.\n\nZhou Ze covered his nose, lifted his foot, and found that the seawater had instantly spread up to his ankles.\n\nThe hall was like a reservoir, and these twenty-odd people were like twenty faucets at the edge of the pool, pouring water into it.\n\nThe water collected without dispersing, slowly filling the hall.\n\nZhou Ze leaned in, placed one hand on the shoulder of a middle-aged man, and as his fingernails grew out, he directly plunged them into the man's shoulder.\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nThe sound of oil sizzling in a frying pan emanated, and thick black smoke began to rise from the middle-aged man's body. Yet, he remained seated, motionless, as if completely at Zhou Ze's mercy.\n\n\"Snap...\"\n\nA crisp snap came from beneath Zhou Ze's foot,\n\nand then,\n\na greenish belt wrapped around Zhou Ze's arm. Zhou Ze instinctively recoiled; this belt was very nimble, darting directly towards him.\n\nWhen one end of the belt lifted, stopping less than a decimeter from Zhou Ze's eyes, it froze.\n\nThis was no belt; it was clearly a sea snake, entirely greenish.\n\nThe sea snake flicked its tongue. After assuming a perfect attacking stance, it stopped, seemingly just to deter Zhou Ze.\n\nThe surrounding water began to increase. The contents of those twenty-odd people's stomachs seemed inexhaustible; by now, the water level in the living room had reached Zhou Ze's waist.\n\nThis was fake, yet it was real.\n\nZhou Ze could choose to disconnect from this sensation and then leave, but that would mean he was admitting defeat, stepping down from the ring of his own accord.\n\nNot to mention whether he'd get his service fee, even the souls of this family, he wouldn't be able to collect them for performance credit.\n\n\"Plop...\"\n\nThe painting hanging on the living room wall was also washed down by the water, slowly floating over to Zhou Ze's side.\n\nZhou Ze had previously thought this divine image was somewhat strange, because typically, in people's homes, divine images hung in the hall were mostly of Maitreya Buddha, Guanyin, or the God of Wealth. But the deity in this painting was clearly not a common one.\n\nThe painting depicted a man with a fish-like body but human limbs, riding a two-headed dragon. It was definitely a deity, but ordinary households practically never hung such a thing; it was quite unconventional.\n\nAt this point, the sea snake seemed to be slowly contracting its body, and Zhou Ze felt a clamping force on his wrist. This was a warning, a second warning.\n\nWarning Zhou Ze,\n\nthat this matter,\n\nhe shouldn't interfere with.\n\nThe painting slowly drifted to Zhou Ze's front, touching his body.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, thinking hard. Finally, he realized which divine being was depicted in the painting!\n\nSo, he really had to thank himself for reading more books after becoming a bookstore owner, sitting on the downstairs sofa, drinking coffee and reading whenever he had nothing to do, especially making up for lost time on ancient tales of the strange.\n\nThis was... a Sea God!\n\nFor people nowadays, when a Sea God is mentioned, the first thought is usually Mazu or Poseidon. However, in reality, within the Chinese mythological system, there is an even older Sea God.\n\nA passage from the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas, Eastern Great Wilderness Chapter\" states: \"On an islet in the Eastern Sea there is a god, with a human face and a bird's body, adorned with two yellow snakes and treading on two yellow snakes, named Yu Guo. Huangdi gave birth to Yu Guo, Yu Guo gave birth to Yu Jing, Yu Jing resides in the Northern Sea, and Yu Guo resides in the Eastern Sea, serving as a Sea God.\"\n\nAn ancient Sea God. Actually, considering that the old man upstairs started his business in sea smuggling, it's understandable why he would hang this divine image in his home.\n\nBut what did this mean?\n\nA group of deceased relatives who died at sea suddenly returning for revenge five years later?\n\nWho brought them back?\n\nWho permitted them to return?\n\nFor people who died in remote places or died unnatural deaths, their souls are actually very difficult to recall. That's why in folk customs, when burning scriptures and joss paper, there's an indispensable step called \"soul summoning,\" which means to call back the souls of those being commemorated to receive the incense offerings of their descendants.\n\nAs for those who died at sea, they either went directly to the underworld, or even if they could remain as lingering souls, they would be like those in *Pirates of the Caribbean*, only able to sink to the seabed or drift around with some ghost ship.\n\nNow, here was an entire family, neatly reunited, sitting properly, coming to visit the old man. Without external forces pushing them, without the tacit approval of some entity,\n\nwas it possible?\n\nCould it be,\n\nthat the Sea God truly was enraged?\n\nIt was almost certain that the old man's family had died under suspicious circumstances, and the old man had married this woman in that same year.\n\nIf a great deity was truly enraged and was coming to exact punishment and retribution,\n\nwould he, a mere underworld official,\n\nreally have the right to stop it?\n\nMoreover, to confront an entity from the sea for something like \"making money,\"\n\nwasn't that a bit foolish?\n\nZhou Ze looked up. The woman and the old man should be upstairs. The woman wanted the old man to die naturally so she could inherit the legacy, and supernatural beings wouldn't be caught on surveillance.\n\n\"Hey, pal, can we discuss something? Can you let that old man die a bit more naturally?\n\nAnd then, that old man's current wife upstairs, can I take her away?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked the painting.\n\n\"Hiss!\"\n\nThe sea snake suddenly became enraged,\n\nand directly bared its fangs, biting towards Zhou Ze's chest.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened. He had been guarding against this snake. His fingertips clamped onto the snake's tail, and its tongue stopped mere centimeters from Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n\"No room for negotiation at all? Give me some leeway, big bro,\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile.\n\n\"Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss!\"\n\nThe sea snake thrashed its body wildly,\n\nwith a \"splat\",\n\nits body snapped directly in two, and its head flew towards Zhou Ze's chest, immediately biting into Zhou Ze's body.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nwhat Zhou Ze felt was not physical injury, but a searing pain from his soul, as if his soul had been pierced by the snake's fangs, leaving two holes.\n\nCold sweat immediately broke out. Zhou Ze knelt down, using one hand to brace himself against the ground so he wouldn't fall into the \"water.\"\n\n\"Huff... huff...\"\n\nZhou Ze forcibly pulled out the snake's head,\n\nand his black fingernails directly crushed the snake's head.\n\n\"You're being unreasonable...\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself, his expression growing increasingly grim.\n\nThen, he slowly lifted his head, and in the depths of his eyes, black light swirled.\n\n\"Then I'd like to see if you can *damn* well come ashore from the sea to lord it over everyone!\"\n***\n*Wu Dalang and Pan Jinlian are notorious characters from the classic Chinese novel \"Water Margin,\" known for their scandalous and tragic story involving infidelity, betrayal, and murder.

    "content": "\"I say, little sister, is your boss's part-time job being a Daoist priest or a monk?\"\n\nOn the balcony, the woman took out a thin cigarette and quietly smoked it. She wouldn't smoke at home under surveillance, always deliberately maintaining her image as a good, virtuous wife.\n\nBut for some reason, at this moment, she felt a little flustered and wanted to rely on a cigarette to calm her emotions.\n\n\"You got it backward,\" Bai Yingying replied, \"running the bookstore is the part-time job.\"\n\n\"Oh, how interesting.\"\n\nThe woman reached out to help Bai Yingying tidy her hairbun, saying softly:\n\n\"Has he brainwashed you, that you worship him so much?\"\n\nBai Yingying looked at the woman with a gaze usually reserved for idiots.\n\nThe woman shook her head. She didn't believe it, but just as she had said, since this was someone Wang Ke recommended, she was willing to throw a few million away just to try.\n\nThe old man huddled by the room door, watching his wife and Bai Yingying, waving and shouting:\n\n\"Come in, quickly hide inside, they're coming, they're going to come, they really are!\"\n\nThe woman ignored her husband and continued smoking her cigarette.\n\nBai Yingying ignored him even more. She was worried about the boss downstairs, wondering if anything unexpected would happen to him.\n\nThe boss had just unleashed his 'Wushuang' state* in Yancheng, and now his physical condition was very poor. In other words, his skill cooldown time hadn't passed yet, so the danger factor would naturally increase.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe living room door downstairs was pushed open,\n\nZhou Ze, drenched in cold sweat, tumbled out from inside. He was soaking wet all over, as if soaked by cold sweat.\n\n\"Gasping… gasping…\"\n\nLying on the ground, Zhou Ze gasped for air, as if air were precious to him, cherished beyond measure.\n\n\"Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying on the balcony called out anxiously.\n\nZhou Ze scrambled to his feet, picking up the fallen crutch beside him. He waved his hand upward, gesturing to Bai Yingying not to come down, and then walked back into the living room.\n\nAbout ten minutes later,\n\nZhou Ze tumbled out again. This time, he lay for a full five minutes before slowly getting up. Standing again with his crutch, Zhou Ze's body seemed a little shaky.\n\n\"Boss…\"\n\nBai Yingying called out again.\n\n\"Don't come down. Protect them. I refuse to believe it; even a strong dragon can't suppress a local snake!†\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk back inside.\n\nThe woman blew out a smoke ring and said, \"Such a realistic act.\"\n\nClearly, she thought Zhou Ze was acting, just like those Daoist priests performing rituals, simply to please the audience and gain profit.\n\n\"Uh…\"\n\nThe woman was speechless,\n\nbecause Bai Yingying's hand had directly clamped around her neck,\n\nher feet were already off the ground. This high school girl had easily lifted her with just one hand.\n\n\"This isn't an act,\"\n\nBai Yingying said very seriously:\n\n\"If the boss truly has any accident, rest assured, I will definitely take my anger out on you.\"\n\n\"He… he himself… for… for money…\" the woman retorted with difficulty.\n\n\"You're a woman, don't you know one truth?\" Bai Yingying countered.\n\n\"Wh-… what…\"\n\n\"That's: don't reason with a woman.\"\n\n………………\n\nZhou Ze walked back into the living room. By now, the living room was practically filled with water; it was all liquid, but those twenty-odd people were still ceaselessly spewing water.\n\nIt was truly endless, a genuine torrent.\n\nAnd the sea snake that Zhou Ze had initially 'headshotted' had now transformed into a water python, with a thick, barrel-like body, swimming back and forth, exuding immense pressure.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the giant python itself was bloody and mangled, with many places missing scales. Clearly, it had also been severely damaged in its repeated clashes with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Hiss, hiss, hiss…\"\n\nThe water python charged over again,\n\nZhou Ze raised his head, gritted his teeth, and extended his hands. Bloodstains appeared on his fingernails again, clearly having reached their breaking point from the strain.\n\nHis body was indeed somewhat weakened now, having been recently depleted in Yancheng.\n\nIf he were in his prime, Zhou Ze felt he wouldn't be in such a sorry state.\n\nThis was just a sea snake. Even if it claimed to be the Sea God, it was still just a snake. In a one-on-one fight, he wouldn't be intimidated.\n\nWhat Zhou Ze was actually worried about was if a Sea God truly existed in this world, whether his choice this time would anger them,\n\nOf course, the other party hadn't really given him a choice.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to back down, to retreat. If he didn't have to fight, he wouldn't. If he could avoid touching a tiger's whiskers, he would. But the other party's attitude was too crude, offering him no way out at all.\n\nBoss Zhou loved money, and he loved performance, but he loved his life even more.\n\n\"Hiss, hiss…\"\n\nThe water python's body slammed into Zhou Ze again. Zhou Ze fell to the ground, his face pale, but Zhou Ze's fingernails, in turn, pierced into the water python's body, grasping a red halo which he instantly crushed!\n\nNext, the water python and Zhou Ze lay together on the ground, staring blankly at each other.\n\nThe water python tried to coil up again several times but failed. Zhou Ze also wanted to get up, but couldn't.\n\nOne man, one snake, staring blankly at each other‡, refusing to concede defeat, locked in a standoff.\n\n\"Aren't you tired?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe water python didn't respond, just stared fixedly at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Did the Sea God really send you?\" Zhou Ze continued to ask.\n\nThe water python still didn't respond.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. He could still talk to a person, but with a beast,\n\nhow could he talk?\n\nAs if sensing Zhou Ze's thoughts, the water python suddenly raised its head, its gaze filled with anger as it stared at Zhou Ze.\n\nHeh,\n\nJust like that monkey,\n\ncan it directly perceive human thoughts?\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe water python began to tremble. In an instant, its body started to disintegrate, but from its shattered form, tiny, thumb-sized snakes began to emerge.\n\nThis dense swarm of creatures began to surge towards Zhou Ze like an overwhelming tide!\n\n\"Get out!\"\n\nZhou Ze braced himself with both hands on the ground, forcefully raising his head. His fingernails directly pierced into the floor. Strands of black energy were squeezed out, forming a circle around him to protect him. All the small snakes that touched the black energy were annihilated.\n\nThe standoff between the man and the snake seemed destined to continue. Both were at the end of their tether§, yet still holding on.\n\nAnd just then, the twenty-odd people who had been acting as 'faucets' uniformly closed their mouths, then slowly began to stand up.\n\nThey didn't walk towards Zhou Ze, nor towards the water python. Instead, they lined up, like elementary school students leaving school in the evening, and walked towards the staircase.\n\nThey,\n\nwere going upstairs!\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if his arrival had stimulated them into action, or if he had just coincidentally arrived at the right time?\n\n\"Hiss, hiss, hiss…\"\n\nA fearless little snake actually penetrated Zhou Ze's black energy. Its body compressed, then it sprang up, directly darting towards Zhou Ze's ear.\n\nZhou Ze felt a slippery sensation by his ear; that thing was still trying hard to burrow inside.\n\nBut there were even more small snakes all around. Zhou Ze dared not pull his hands out of the floor, or he would experience the feeling of a 'snake pit.' It was said that tyrannical ancient monarchs enjoyed this method, throwing condemned people into snake dens.\n\nBut the sickening sensation coming from his ear was truly vivid. If he didn't stop it, God knew how far that thing could burrow.\n\nTongcheng had a tradition of temple fairs. Zhou Ze remembered that when he was little, the orphanage also organized trips for everyone to attend temple fairs. He recalled a tent there, where for two yuan a ticket, there was a woman lying on a bed covered by a mosquito net, surrounded by many small snakes.\n\nThe woman would perform for those who bought tickets: she would hold a small snake, insert it into her nostril, and then the snake would slowly crawl out of her mouth.\n\nAs an observer then, he found it astonishing, but Zhou Ze certainly didn't want to experience it himself.\n\nBut Zhou Ze had no other options now. He hadn't brought the Yin-Yang Scroll with him, because that thing, when near dying people, would vibrate incessantly like a vibrating rod‖, disturbing his peace of mind.\n\nOh, right,\n\nhe still had a bronze ring, but he wasn't sure what it was for. He had it on him, but if putting it on ended up killing him, then he'd truly have nowhere to cry.\n\nDeep breaths, deep breaths, ceaseless deep breaths.\n\nThe slippery thing in his ear was still burrowing further in, causing unbearable itching.\n\nZhou Ze could only instinctively lean his face, using his shoulder and arm to press against his ear, hoping to force that thing out.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze suddenly remembered he seemed to have two ghost messenger credentials in his left pocket.\n\nI'll bet on it!\n\nPulling his hands from the floor, Zhou Ze quickly took out a ghost messenger credential. Before the surrounding snake swarm could rush in, Zhou Ze fiercely rubbed the credential with his bloodied fingernails. Green smoke continuously rose from the credential, and then the document began to crack, clearly being rendered useless.\n\nBut the green smoke continued to rise, like a match being lit.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nZhou Ze threw the ghost messenger credential out of the house.\n\nThe immense swarm of small snakes instantly abandoned Zhou Ze and rushed towards the ghost messenger credential outside.\n\nIt seemed that because the water python had divided into too many, too small individuals, the intelligence of each individual had also been averaged out. Zhou Ze felt as if he had just been playing fetch with a dog.\n\nAnd the family that had just been going upstairs also rushed downstairs like mad, running into the snake swarm outside the living room. Clearly, the peculiar scent emanating from the burning ghost messenger credential had an incredibly strong attraction for ghosts!\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze neither relaxed nor paused to catch his breath. He directly reached out and grabbed the portrait, unhesitatingly tearing it open with his fingernails.\n\n\"Rip!\"\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nthe portrait split open. The small snakes inside and outside the house slowly began to evaporate, and that family also slowly melted away.\n\n\"Slam!\"\n\nA chilling wind swept through, and the living room door slammed shut.\n\nFinally,\n\neverything returned to calm.\n\n\"Gasping… gasping…\"\n\nZhou Ze knelt prostrate on the ground,\n\nSo tired,\n\nCompletely drained,\n\nHowever,\n\nnow it seemed,\n\nthat Sea God wasn't so great after all.\n\nBoss Zhou was instantly filled with a profound sense of accomplishment, feeling incredibly good about himself.\n\n\"Slam!\"\n\n\"Slam!\"\n\nIt seemed like the wind was picking up outside,\n\nthe wind constantly slammed against the doorframe,\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't pay it any mind, but slowly, he realized something was wrong. The floor was still incessantly shaking and tilting.\n\nZhou Ze used his last bit of strength to prop himself against the wall and get up, stumbling to the door,\n\nReached out,\n\nand pushed open the living room door,\n\nOutside,\n\nA vast,\n\nexpanse of ocean!\n\n---\n*   **'Wushuang' state:** *Literally \"peerless\" or \"matchless,\" referring to a powerful ultimate ability in video games, often implying a state of overwhelming power or invincibility.

    "content": "Oh, ocean, ocean, you’re all water...\n\nZhou Ze leaned against the door frame, looking at the surging waves outside, feeling a bit helpless and a bit of a headache. It was much like the feeling of powerlessness when one stands up from a pile of corpses after a battle, only to find a group of enemy cavalry appearing in front.\n\nIt was as if all his previous efforts were a joke, a farce, utterly meaningless.\n\n“Boss! Come quick, Boss!”\n\nBai Yingying suddenly shouted from above, seemingly having encountered an emergency.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, then tried reaching his hand outside. The touch was cold, exceptionally real.\n\nIn fact, everyone knew in their hearts that this was fake; it had to be fake.\n\nIt wasn’t like the Dragon King of myth flooding Chentang Pass to force Nezha to his death; Zhou Ze couldn’t possibly believe that the Sea God would really cause a great flood to drown Tongcheng just to trouble him, a ghost messenger.\n\nFirstly, the other party probably didn’t have such exaggerated divine powers,\n\nSecondly, even if he did, he wouldn’t dare to do it.\n\nThe seawater was fake, but the problem was, it could deceive all your senses, making every perception from top to bottom believe that you were drowning.\n\nThis could be a form of hypnosis, but it transcended hypnosis. Ghosts generally used such methods to lure and kill people, but when this one used it, it would be even more terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze believed that even if he were to make a wooden raft and drift out now, the Sea God could probably keep him adrift on the sea for ten days to half a month without change, literally letting him die of thirst, starvation, or drowning.\n\nLeaning on the wall, Zhou Ze slowly walked up the stairs; Bai Yingying had just called him.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze laboriously emerged from the stairs, he found that his position was not the second floor of a residential house, but the deck of a cruise ship.\n\n“Boss, this place has changed.”\n\nBai Yingying stood on the deck, shouting to Zhou Ze.\n\n“Where are the old man and the woman?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBai Yingying had previously been assigned by him to the second floor to protect the old man and the woman, but now Bai Yingying was alone.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze subconsciously sat down on a nearby chair, letting out a long sigh of relief. There was a sunshade above him, and drinks and alcohol beside him.\n\nZhou Ze was genuinely tired. It was a miracle that this body hadn’t fallen apart after being repeatedly put through the wringer by him; now, even a slight movement would cause all his body’s joints to revolt and ache.\n\n“I don’t know, I just felt a blur in front of my eyes just now, and then I found myself on the cruise ship.”\n\nBai Yingying looked around and continued:\n\n“Although I know all of this is fake, similar to the illusion techniques my lady used before, it’s really so realistic, even the salty taste in the air is the same.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded, picked up the nearby glass, poured himself some ice water, took two sips, and said:\n\n“If I’m not mistaken, this cruise ship should be the one that had an accident five years ago. Look around, that family should be here,” Zhou Ze reminded.\n\n“What if I find them?”\n\n“I don’t know either, I don’t know illusion techniques.”\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his temples. *When in Rome, do as the Romans do*¹, he thought. If that Sea God insists on not giving up, then he can only wait and respond. After all, the two parties are not on the same level.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had always been grilled over a fire², the key reason being that the Sea God’s position was too high, disdaining to talk to him, and naturally disdaining to negotiate terms with him.\n\nBai Yingying obediently went upstairs to look. This cruise ship had three levels: the middle deck, an upper level, and a cabin level. Soon, Bai Yingying came down from the upper level and said:\n\n“No one upstairs.”\n\n“Then go down and check again.”\n\nBai Yingying went down to look again. Earlier, when Zhou Ze came up, the lower level was still the original living room, but when Bai Yingying went down again, it had transformed into the cabin area.\n\n“Boss, still no one.” Bai Yingying shouted after finishing her search.\n\n“No one?”\n\nThis made Zhou Ze also feel a bit incredulous.\n\n“Yeah, I checked every room downstairs, confirmed no one. Not even a single crew member. This cruise ship is just sitting by itself on the sea.”\n\n“This shouldn’t be.”\n\nZhou Ze mumbled to himself,\n\nThose in higher positions always liked to play tricks with karma and retribution, probably because it made them seem more ‘B-level’³; just like Patriarch Bodhi tapping Sun Wukong’s head three times.\n\nPreviously, when he saw the seawater and then the cruise ship, Zhou Ze thought that the Sea God wanted them to see exactly how that incident five years ago unfolded.\n\nOr perhaps, the Sea God wanted to both punish those he intended to punish and also show off a high-level maneuver, showing off so much that you’d be utterly submissive, only able to clap your hands and shout from the side:\n\n“Oh,\n\nSo that’s how it is,\n\nIndeed,\n\nHow surprising,\n\n666666666!”⁴\n\nBut now you’ve only conjured up an ocean and a cruise ship, and besides me and Bai Yingying, there are no extras?\n\nHow is this script supposed to proceed?\n\nCould it be that the Sea God is low on battery, so he only managed half and couldn’t finish the other half?\n\n“Check again, see if there’s any other information.”\n\nZhou Ze could only grit his teeth and stand up, heading downstairs first, while Bai Yingying went upstairs to check again.\n\n“Please don’t let it be a half-finished product due to low battery.”\n\nZhou Ze could only shout this in his heart, because if it was just a stage set up, and the Sea God wanted to show off in front of him, a mere ghost messenger, then the worst outcome would be the Sea God succeeding, showing him up completely, and then those who were supposed to die would die, he wouldn’t have saved anyone, and there’d be no news of the final payment. But after that, they could all go home to their respective mothers⁵.\n\nBut if it’s a half-finished product, how is this script going to continue?\n\nWill he and Bai Yingying just stand here awkwardly like this?\n\nHeaven knows how long this illusion can last. He was completely clueless about this, and Bai Yingying might know a little, but she was only half-baked⁶. He couldn’t possibly stay in this wretched place for decades, a full sixty years⁷, waiting for Bai Yingying to cultivate to be more awesome, or for himself to evolve a bit more before they could leave?\n\nDuring this time, it’s bad enough there’s no sour plum juice, but there isn’t even food. This body of his couldn’t last this long without eating.\n\nAs he thought, Zhou Ze even deliberately stuck his head out the porthole to look at the sea below.\n\nAre there any fish?\n\nIf there were fish, he could live by eating them.\n\nBut this look was significant: Zhou Ze suddenly discovered a mass of black stuff lurking below the water surface at the side of the ship’s hull, swaying continuously with the waves like seaweed, but never leaving the deck’s position.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously bent down, extending his crutch to try and poke at it in the water, but he didn’t succeed. Instead, he almost fell into the sea himself.\n\nGiven his current physical state, comparable to an old man of seventy or eighty, if he fell in, he would truly just drown. He’d barely even manage to thrash a few times in a dying struggle.\n\n“Yingying.”\n\nZhou Ze shouted upwards.\n\nThump-thump-thump...\n\nBai Yingying quickly ran down.\n\n“Boss, what’s wrong?”\n\n“Go look in the water, what is that thing?” Zhou Ze said, pointing downwards.\n\nBai Yingying leaned over to look, also noticing the mass of black “seaweed,” and immediately leaped down.\n\nGraceful posture,\n\nStandard movements,\n\nMinimal splash.\n\nAfter hitting the water, Bai Yingying continued to dive downwards with the momentum, while Zhou Ze waited above.\n\nAbout half a minute later, Bai Yingying surfaced. At this point, the female zombie was completely drenched, and her complexion was even a bit pale. Zhou Ze didn’t think her paleness was because Bai Yingying was frozen by the low seawater temperature.\n\nZombies afraid of cold?\n\nIs that possible?\n\n“What is that thing?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Boss, they… they…”\n\n“Hurry up and tell me.” Zhou Ze urged.\n\nThis concerned whether he and Bai Yingying could leave this damned place.\n\n“They’re all down there, Boss, the whole family, all down there.”\n\nBai Yingying pointed downwards.\n\n“All down there?” Zhou Ze was a bit surprised, and at the same time, thought of something, pointing at the black “seaweed” below and saying, “Is that hair?”\n\n“Yes, it’s hair.” Bai Yingying affirmed.\n\n“Are they all drowned?”\n\n“Uh…”\n\nBai Yingying showed a very dazed and adorable expression, a bit conflicted, a bit embarrassed, and a bit at a loss.\n\nIf it weren’t for the distance and his crutch not being long enough, Zhou Ze would have loved to raise his crutch and tap her on the head right then. At a time like this, you’re still soaking in the water, and you’re even acting cute?\n\n“Boss, you jump down and see for yourself, it’s not easy to describe.” Bai Yingying simply said.\n\n“…” Zhou Ze.\n\n*If I could jump down, why didn’t I just jump down instead of calling you?*\n\n“Boss, come down, I’ll catch you.” Bai Yingying opened her arms. “You really have to see what’s down there for yourself.”\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then simply dropped his crutch, flipped over, and really jumped off the deck.\n\nWith a “plop,” he entered the water,\n\nand then Zhou Ze was embraced by Bai Yingying.\n\n“Boss, take a deep breath. I’ll take you down. If you need to breathe, pinch my chest.”\n\n“…” Zhou Ze.\n\nImmediately after, seeing Zhou Ze take a deep breath, Bai Yingying directly took him down. Her physical quality was very strong, even completely surpassing that of swimmers, so even with Zhou Ze as a burden, she was still completely at ease underwater.\n\nAfter entering the water,\n\nZhou Ze first saw a large iron cage leaning against the side of the ship’s hull, as if nailed in place.\n\nInside this iron cage, a large offering table was also fixed in place. On the offering table were statues and ancestral tablets, conspicuously belonging to the Water God. Even the offerings on it were fixed there, allowing them to remain relatively still underwater, along with the cage.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nInside the iron cage,\n\nmore than twenty people,\n\nmen and women, old and young,\n\nconstantly drifted with the waves inside the iron cage.\n\nSome were at the bottom,\n\nsome were in the middle,\n\nthe most pitiful was a woman, probably around twenty years old,\n\nwhose head was stuck in a gap at the very top of the iron cage, accidentally fixed in place,\n\nand her hair extended outwards,\n\nupwards,\n\ndrifting,\n\ndrifting…\n\n——————\n\nApologies, everyone. Long’s body is a bit unwell today and something came up, so the update is late. There will be another chapter in the early morning.\n\nDon’t panic,\n\nHug Long tightly!\n\n---\n¹ “既來之則安之” (jì lái zhī zé ān zhī): A Chinese idiom meaning “since you are here, make yourself at home,” or more broadly, “accept and adapt to the situation.” Translated as “When in Rome, do as the Romans do” for natural English flow.\n² “被架在火上烤著” (bèi jià zài huǒ shàng kǎo zhe): A Chinese idiom meaning “to be roasted over a fire,” implying being in a difficult or awkward situation, or being put on the spot.\n³ “B格” (B gé): An internet slang term, short for “裝B的格調” (zhuāng B de gédiào), implying a pretentious or showy style, often used ironically to describe someone trying to appear sophisticated or cool.

    "content": "Zhou Ze was very shocked to see this. This display was too grand, wasn't it?\n\nEven Daoists in TV shows setting up an altar for a sacrifice wouldn't have such a grand display. In ordinary temples, using some fruit and a pig's head for a sacrifice was already considered quite well-off.\n\nAnd here,\n\nIt was a live human sacrifice!\n\nOver twenty living people,\n\nThat entire family,\n\nWere deliberately placed here, serving as offerings, to sacrifice to the Sea God!\n\nZhou Ze's experiences were special; he had even been to Hell. In his two lives, he had seen many humans and ghosts. Logically speaking, there weren't many things left that could truly shake his mind.\n\nBut the scene before him made Zhou Ze's composure falter in an instant.\n\nOne must know, among them, there were not only old crones with completely white hair and wrinkled skin, but also very young children. These people should have had their own lives, their own laughter and joy, but now they were all confined here. They couldn't even drift freely like fish; they could only crash from one side of the cage to the other with the waves.\n\nEven after death, they were still penned in!\n\nThe person who performed the sacrifice and arranged all this seemed afraid that their carefully prepared offerings would spill out, causing the Sea God not to get a full meal, not to eat comfortably, or not to eat enough, showing such extreme consideration.\n\n\"Gulp...\"\n\nHis body was a bit weak now, causing his breath-holding time to be shorter. Zhou Ze reached out and lifted Bai Yingying's wrist, which was wrapped around his waist, signaling her to take him up for air.\n\nHowever,\n\nBai Yingying was unmoved, as if she felt nothing.\n\nZhou Ze pinched her hand,\n\nShe remained unmoved, not budging an inch.\n\nZhou Ze grabbed her arm,\n\nShe still appeared completely oblivious.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and glared at her.\n\nHe then found Bai Yingying was actually closing her eyes!\n\nI can't see,\n\nOh, I'm not looking, I'm not looking.\n\nThe fingernail on Zhou Ze's right index finger grew out,\n\nBai Yingying's body suddenly trembled,\n\nAnd she immediately held Zhou Ze and floated upwards,\n\n\"Gasping... Gasping... Gasping...\"\n\nAfter getting air, Zhou Ze felt much more comfortable. He also didn't bother to dwell on Bai Yingying's little scheme just now and said directly:\n\n\"Let's go up.\"\n\n\"Alrighty, Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't bring up what just happened either. Then, like a small King Kong, she wrapped her right arm around Zhou Ze's waist, directly picking him up like a ragdoll, grabbed the side of the boat with her other hand, and climbed straight up.\n\nSwift, decisive, and effortless.\n\nZhou Ze first sat on a chair. While catching his breath, he also waited for some of the water on his clothes to drip off, otherwise, his clothes would be too heavy and difficult to wear.\n\n\"Boss, what exactly was going on down there just now?\"\n\n\"You don't know?\"\n\n\"How could I know?\"\n\n\"Wasn't your madam drowned in a pig cage after being caught having an affair with a scholar?\"\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\n\"Someone used living people as sacrifices, making offerings to the Sea God,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"As sacrifices? Offerings?\" Bai Yingying was very surprised. Even as a zombie, she felt this kind of thing was too cruel and utterly inhumane.\n\n\"So what's going on now? We're here, and there's an iron cage below us filled with corpses. What is this for?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure either, and I have a premonition that this matter is probably inseparable from that old man or that woman. At the very least, that old man definitely has a hand in it.\"\n\nWhy would the old man definitely have a hand in it?\n\nWhat about that vixen? Might she be an exception?\n\nBai Yingying thought to herself.\n\nJust then, the wind picked up, and it was very strong. The originally calm sea suddenly became turbulent with waves, causing the cruise ship to sway back and forth non-stop, as if it could capsize at any moment.\n\nZhou Ze continued to sit on the chair. To be honest, he felt somewhat helpless now. If he were a judge of the underworld, he might still have the right to communicate with the other party on equal terms, but as he was now, he was clearly not taken seriously by the other party.\n\nOf course, the most important question right now was, in traditional beliefs, was this Lord Sea God considered a good or a bad entity?\n\nDid he accept the offerings and give the sacrificer a corresponding reward, or did the sacrificer's actions make him feel angry and defiled, and thus he specifically came to punish him?\n\nAt his level, traditional concepts of right and wrong, good and evil, should be very difficult to restrain his actions, right?\n\n\"Clang...\"\n\nThe seawater crashed over them wave after wave. The swaying amplitude of the cruise ship also grew larger and larger. Bai Yingying stood firm with both feet, one hand gripping Zhou Ze's shoulder, also helping Zhou Ze stay stable on the deck.\n\n\"Boss, this boat is going to capsize.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze, leaning on Bai Yingying's arm, struggled to stand up. When his gaze turned forward, he found that there seemed to be land ahead. No, to be precise, it should be an island, an island of not insignificant size.\n\n\"CRASH!\"\n\nA harsh sound of mechanical friction came. The cruise ship finally couldn't bear it and completely capsized. Bai Yingying was quick-witted, grabbing Zhou Ze and jumping into the sea before the cruise ship overturned.\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze was lucky. How many drowning victims, before they drowned, wished that by their side, there was also a Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying swam while keeping Zhou Ze's head above the water so he could breathe fresh air. Zhou Ze was like a little kangaroo in a kangaroo mother's pouch, being delicately cared for.\n\nHe could only raise his head, breathing while spitting out the spray that splashed into his mouth and nostrils,\n\nAnd at the same time... gazing at the sky.\n\nFinally, Bai Yingying reached the shore.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the beach, gasping heavily.\n\n\"Boss, there's another person lying over there.\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly pointed towards that part of the beach and said.\n\nZhou Ze turned his body to look. Indeed, there was a young man lying there, wearing very tattered clothes. If he himself was a salted fish before, then that one was a salted fish about to be sun-dried.\n\n\"I'll go kill him.\"\n\nBai Yingying said, following her policy of nipping all dangerous signs in the bud.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pressed down on Bai Yingying, shaking his head, and said at the same time, \"Don't you feel that guy looks a bit familiar?\"\n\n\"Familiar?\" Bai Yingying stared hard. Finally, she seemed to have thought of something, saying, \"He looks like that old man. Is he that old man's son? Oh no, or perhaps his grandson.\"\n\n\"Not similar, and he shouldn't be,\" Zhou Ze denied.\n\nAt this moment, a python crawled out of the seawater.\n\nThis python, Zhou Ze also found somewhat familiar. It really looked like the one he had fought before, except that the snake now looked a bit smaller and its scales were not as thick as before.\n\nThe snake slowly crawled onto the young man's body. It showed no murderous intent or ferocity. Moreover, it seemed to completely ignore that Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying were right beside it, only staring at the person beneath it.\n\n\"Boss, this snake is about to become a spirit,\" Bai Yingying suddenly said.\n\n\"I can see that.\"\n\nThis python gave off a feeling full of wisdom and anthropomorphic emotion, a bit like the monkey Zhou Ze first encountered.\n\nThe python opened its mouth, not biting the young man in front of it, but instead bit its own body, creating a wound on itself. Then, its body coiled around the young man, bringing the bitten wound to the man's mouth.\n\nAt first, the python's blood just slowly dripped into the man's mouth. Soon, the man seemed to regain some consciousness and began to actively suck the snake's blood. The color returned to his face as well.\n\nFinally, the man let go, let out a long sigh, and then he opened his eyes. When he first saw the python, the man trembled all over in fear.\n\nThe python didn't linger and directly swam back into the sea from the beach. A pool of bloodstain still remained on the ground.\n\nAfter the python entered the sea and swam away, the man immediately got up and repeatedly kowtowed several times in the direction the python had gone, muttering something. Then he reached out and picked up a snake scale that remained on the ground.\n\n\"What was he shouting?\" Bai Yingying asked. Because the man's dialect was a bit strong, Bai Yingying couldn't hear very clearly.\n\n\"He's thanking the Sea God for saving him,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe man walked into the island's woods and disappeared.\n\n\"So here's the problem, Boss, how do we leave?\"\n\nBai Yingying asked, tilting her head. Immediately after, she seemed to have thought of something again, and asked:\n\n\"I think it would be quite nice for us to be Robinsons here too.\"\n\nThe bookstore had \"Robinson Crusoe,\" which Bai Yingying read in her spare time.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his maid had recently been acting a bit abnormal, as if she had become silly from watching too many Korean dramas.\n\nJust then, the cruise ship that had just capsized reappeared on the sea surface.\n\n\"Wow, Boss, the boat is back.\"\n\n\"I can see that.\"\n\nThat cruise ship had returned again. However, this time there were people on the cruise ship, and many people.\n\nAn old man was sitting in a wheelchair and was pushed down from the ship by an attendant. The attendant was a woman, her face covered by a white veil, but from her figure and demeanor, this woman also looked a bit familiar.\n\n\"Her breasts were a bit saggy, her backside was a bit fatter, and her waist was a bit thicker. Boss, if you reverse-engineer her figure back, doesn't she look very much like someone?\"\n\nIt was that woman, the old man's wife.\n\nMany people came down from the ship. The old man sat in a wheelchair, with an IV drip hanging above him. Clearly, the old man didn't have much time left.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's gaze instantly narrowed. He saw another priest walk down from the cruise ship, an Asian priest.\n\nYes, that's right,\n\nIt was this guy who stole his own ashes!\n\nHowever, this priest now looked a bit younger, his skin also fairer and clearer, with a round face, looking completely harmless.\n\nHe walked up to the old man. The old man waved the woman away. The woman walked away to a very distant spot; some things were not convenient for her to know, and she was also very self-aware and sensible.\n\nThe old man seemed to be saying something to the priest; the priest nodded in agreement beside him.\n\nThen,\n\nThe old man took out a black scale from his bosom.\n\nThe priest looked at the scale, then lowered his head and whispered something into the old man's ear.\n\nUpon hearing this, the old man first showed a look of shock on his face, then a look of struggle. He seemed to be hesitating, agonizing. Finally, the old man looked at his still hanging IV drip, then looked at the alluring woman standing in the distance.\n\nHis fingers clutched the scale tightly with force, veins bulging.\n\nThen he gritted his teeth, with a violent expression on his face,\n\nAnd at the same time, nodded.\n\nThe priest bowed slightly beside him.\n\n\"Boss, their voices are too low, I can't hear them.\"\n\nBai Yingying said helplessly. She tried to walk forward to get closer to the old man and the priest who were talking, but no matter how far she walked forward, the distance between those two and her would correspondingly lengthen.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand,\n\nSaying, \"No need to listen.\"\n\n\"Then how do we leave here?\" Bai Yingying asked, somewhat uneasy.\n\n\"We can leave,\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"Actually, there is no Sea God at all.\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't understand, but Zhou Ze was perplexed. Yes, there was no Sea God.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"There is no Sea God, only a snake that was mistaken for one.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his head, looked into the air, and shouted:\n\n\"You can't beat me, and you've also been seriously wounded by me. This illusion can't last much longer, can it?\n\nEspecially after I knew you weren't actually the Sea God, this illusion of yours lost ninety-nine percent of its deterrent power. Do you think you still have a chance to kill me in here?\"\n\n\"Hissing...\"\n\nA snake head slowly emerged from the sand beside Zhou Ze.\n\nAll the surrounding illusions began to shatter.\n\nZhou Ze was currently sitting on the living room floor, while Bai Yingying was standing beside Zhou Ze. Everything around them returned to normal.\n\n\"I didn't intend to kill you...\"\n\nThe python, scarred by Zhou Ze's fingernails, actually spoke human words at this moment, but its voice was a bit sharp.\n\n\"Tsk tsk.\" Zhou Ze reached out, patted the snake's head, then raised his head and said somewhat helplessly, \"You actually wanted to kill me directly at first. You didn't expect I could make you like this, so you changed your method and became circuitous.\"\n\nThe hard way didn't work, so it tried the soft way.\n\n\"He deserves to die...\" the python said.\n\n\"I have a monkey at home, you two should have something in common. But in your state, it's clear you won't live much longer before turning to ashes and smoke. What a pity.\"\n\n\"He deserves to die...\" The python seemed to only know how to say this one sentence.\n\nZhou Ze indeed thought of the monkey, thought of the process of fighting that monkey in the hospital back then, and the final outcome, including how his conscience was \"eaten\" because of that matter.\n\nThe same choice, but this time, Zhou Ze's choice was different. He raised his hand and said very seriously:\n\n\"That woman, she shouldn't die.\"\n\nThe python hesitated for a moment, nodded slightly, which was considered an agreement.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze put down his hand and looked elsewhere.\n\nThe python nodded at Zhou Ze, its tongue brushed against Zhou Ze's arm, and then wriggling its broken body, it crawled towards the stairs.\n\nBai Yingying was a bit confused, looking at Zhou Ze, and asked, \"Boss, didn't that snake save him? It saved him back then, so why does it want to kill him now?\"\n\n\"It's simple. Sixty years ago, this python had just gained sentience and was cultivating and accumulating merits, so it actively saved the young man who was washed ashore and about to die due to a shipwreck.\n\nThe young man survived, then became prosperous, earned a lot of money, became very rich and influential. Then the young man became an old man plagued by illness and close to death.\n\nThe old man didn't want to die. He still had a lot of money, and he still wanted to continue enjoying his life.\n\nFor other people, it was basically impossible to extend one's life beyond medical means, but the old man was different. He had seen the 'Sea God' when he was young; he regarded the snake that saved him as the Sea God.\n\nTherefore, the old man planned to use this to extend his own life. He thought that sixty years ago, the Sea God saved him once, then sixty years later, the Sea God should be able to save him again.\n\nHe also found a sorcerer...\"\n\nSpeaking of that Japanese priest, a strong murderous intent flashed in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThat scoundrel, this time, once his injuries recovered, he must kill him. No matter what else happened then, he must kill him!\n\n\"That priest gave him a method of sacrificing to an evil god, which was to take the lives of his own relatives to extend his own life.\"\n\n\"Ah...\" Bai Yingying exclaimed. \"So the family who drowned on the cruise ship five years ago?\"\n\n\"Didn't you see it all? They were specifically arranged by the old man to be sacrificed. He took his own legal wife, sons and daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, and so on, all as sacrifices to extend his own life.\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"He succeeded, because he had that scale in his hand. Moreover, the method given by that priest was not groundless. Therefore, he succeeded.\n\nDidn't you see? Five years ago, the old man was in a wheelchair and could kick the bucket at any moment, yet five years later, he can actually walk on his own, and even occasionally enjoy marital life with his tender wife.\n\nHe succeeded, he really succeeded.\"\n\n\"Does that mean this python and that old man reached an agreement?\" Bai Yingying asked. \"Then why does this python want to kill him five years later?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\n\"No agreement was reached, the python was tricked, badly tricked by that old man. It had originally cultivated for a certain number of years, following a very orthodox path, but because of the sacrifice the old man performed using its scale, it was directly and passively forced into the sequence of evil gods, unacceptable to heaven and earth. Its centuries of effort basically went up in smoke.\n\nIt was like a mouthful of poisoned milk; the python was confusedly 'nursed' to its downfall¹.\n\nPerhaps that python even encountered some problems because of it at the time, and it took five years to partially resolve them. Then, at all costs, even risking its own life and cultivation being annihilated, it still wanted to come ashore to seek revenge on this old man!\n\nIt saved him back then, but he ended up tricking it.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded thoughtfully. \"So that means, there is no Sea God at all?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"So, Boss, you let it go up for revenge this time?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\nThe implication was, with the previous monkey, he didn't do it this way.\n\n\"I'm seriously injured, I can't beat it anymore, and I don't want to risk my life,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nBai Yingying pouted and pointed to herself.\n\nMeaning, \"I can handle a snake that was almost beaten to a pulp by you.\"\n\n\"You're a little girl, you're even afraid of mice and cockroaches, how could you possibly stop it, right?\"\n\nBai Yingying heard this and understood perfectly,\n\nImmediately clenched both fists, pressing them against her chest, and swayed as she said:\n\n\"Waaah,\n\nYes indeed,\n\nI'm really so scared.\"\n\n——————\n\nP.S.: This chapter is over five thousand characters long. I finished the story before posting it, without breaking it up.\n\nAlso, the double monthly pass event has started. If everyone still has monthly passes, you can cast them for \"Nighttime Bookstore.\"\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: \"Nursed to its downfall\" is an attempt to translate a Chinese internet slang term, \"被奶翻了\" (bèi nǎi fān le). \"奶\" (nǎi) here is slang for \"to heal\" or \"to buff\" (like a support character in a game, who \"nurses\" their allies), and \"翻\" (fān) means \"to overturn\" or \"to defeat.\" The phrase implies that a seemingly beneficial action or blessing ultimately led to a detrimental or ruinous outcome for the recipient, like being \"healed to death\" or having a \"blessing backfire.\"",

    "content": "The matter had drawn its curtain. The previous great voyage, including the islands and everything, was like a Nanke dream*, and ultimately, it had ended.\n\nFrankly, things like demons and ghosts don't belong in polite society; otherwise, this world wouldn't center around \"humans.\" But deficiencies in human nature always give them room to act, and some people even like to court their own demise.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure whether he should immerse himself in the worldview of ghosts or that of humans. In reality, a lot of the time, his own positioning was also a bit vague, and therefore, he simply regarded himself as an observer a lot of the time.\n\nWatching flowers bloom, watching them wither; watching people laugh, watching ghosts cry;\n\nAnything, if seen enough, becomes numb.\n\nZhou Ze had Bai Yingying help him up to the second floor again. Everything there hadn't changed at all. Even when he walked into the room, Zhou Ze still saw the old man lying on the sofa, soundly asleep.\n\nBai Yingying was a bit puzzled, asking, \"Not dead?\"\n\nThat python was indeed put up there by Zhou Ze, and it couldn't kill anyone?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. The person was already dead. The black qi on the old man's glabella couldn't be concealed at all; even if it wasn't an instant death, he would die in an extremely painful manner within the next few days, suffering greatly.\n\nThe woman lay on the ground, her skirt lifted, revealing a large expanse within.\n\nZhou Ze stared at it for a while,\n\nBai Yingying pouted beside him.\n\nA moment later, Zhou Ze walked over and helped the woman tidy her clothes. They were both sound asleep. Many things that had happened before were, for them, like a dream, but the fate of the two of them had already changed several times.\n\nZhou Ze circled the house twice again. Behind a wall, he found half a snake body; it was a small snake, a green small snake, which had already turned into dried snake.\n\nMoreover, the house's door was a bit off, with many strange patterns carved on it. Zhou Ze had Bai Yingying help him take rubbings of all these patterns.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze didn't wake the woman to ask about the final payment, and left directly with Bai Yingying.\n\nAfter returning to the bookstore, about a week passed, and Xu Qinglang also emerged from the terrifying atmosphere of that night, beginning to be responsible for everyone's three meals in the bookstore.\n\nPlus, every night, one or two ghosts came to the bookstore to bring business, so Boss Zhou's days were quite fulfilling. Most importantly, his body had recovered for the most part.\n\nSome matters that should have been resolved already should also be put on the agenda, for example, that priest who had been causing trouble for five years; he should go to hell.\n\n\"Contact Lin Ke, meet at the bookstore tomorrow noon,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying, who was pouring him tea.\n\n\"Okay.\" Bai Yingying immediately took out her phone to send a message, asking, \"Boss, are we going to look for that priest now?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Although the main reason for the old man's family's death was the old man's own deluded great selfishness, that priest also played a significant pushing role in it.\n\nPlus, the other party also stole his ashes. This debt definitely had to be settled.\n\n\"Boss, you seem to have forgotten something very important,\" Bai Yingying reminded him.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The final payment! There's still 8 million in final payment outstanding!\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a laugh.\n\n\"Boss, you can't be like this. Just because someone is pretty, you don't want the money? Being pretty can't be eaten as food.\"\n\n\"That one million deposit is almost enough to last for a long time. Didn't I give you the money I borrowed from you earlier? Go redeem your two burial items.\"\n\n\"No, Boss, how can you live your life like this? You don't know how expensive things are until you manage a household. You casually dismiss 8 million as nothing, how are you going to live your life in the future?\n\nIt's 8 million, not 800!\"\n\nBai Yingying spoke with a tone that implied men indeed couldn't be relied upon.\n\n\"Boss, there's news in the newspaper,\" said the old Daoist, who had just finished mopping the floor, walking over with a newspaper.\n\nThe old man died, and it was in the newspaper. Many people went to mourn, and the cause of death was severe illness; he couldn't hold on.\n\nThe old man was also a respectable person during his lifetime.\n\nHis funeral was also very grand. Actually, this world is like this: many people might be infinitely glorious in public, but who knows about the debauchery behind them? One role in public, another in private; such reversals have long made the public feel numb.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly let out a cry!\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze was just holding his tea, and startled by her, the tea spilled out.\n\n\"Look here, Boss,\" Bai Yingying said, pointing to another section of the newspaper.\n\nZhou Ze looked over. The headline was:\n\n\"Wealthy Widow Donates All Assets.\"\n\nIt was that woman; she had donated all the assets she could inherit.\n\n\"Why would she do that?\" Bai Yingying found it a bit difficult to understand.\n\nThen, Bai Yingying looked at the calm-faced Zhou Ze again, asking, \"Boss, did you already know?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"8 million! Your 8 million has also been donated to Project Hope**!\"\n\n\"Let her donate then.\"\n\n\"Boss, what do you mean, 'let her donate'? She's donating money, not 8 million units of essence***! Besides, Boss, I'm poor too! I still want to buy more burial items, why don't you donate a bit to me?\"\n\nBai Yingying leaned in, acting cute.\n\n\"What 8 million?\" Xu Qinglang walked over, holding coffee.\n\n\"It's about that very rich female client I told you about last time. Originally, after helping her solve her problems, there would be an 8 million final payment, but her husband passed away, and she donated all the inheritance,\" Bai Yingying explained to Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"That exaggerated?\" Xu Qinglang was also startled. \"That donated amount must be in the hundreds of millions then, right?\"\n\n\"Oh, look who's here.\"\n\nThe old Daoist said, pointing at the doorway.\n\nAt the doorway, stood a woman, wearing a black gown, veiled in black gauze,\n\nMany guys were familiar with this attire,\n\nThe attire of a widow.\n\nThe woman walked in, nodding slightly to Zhou Ze, and said, \"I'm returning to my hometown county to live. Your final payment, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean 'I'm sorry'? Do you know how poor my boss is? He can't even pay salaries, and you swallowed 8 million from him!\"\n\nThe old Daoist said haughtily.\n\n\"Old Daoist, the floor is dirty.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nThen, the old Daoist saw Zhou Ze making as if to pour the tea onto the floor, and immediately, wisely, shut up.\n\n\"I'm truly sorry, but you wouldn't mind, would you?\" the woman said, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I don't mind. I only hope that when my living conditions improve and I go to eat barbecue on a cruise ship, it can be calm and peaceful.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\nThe woman turned around, pushed open the door, and walked out directly. She seemed to have come specifically just to say these words.\n\nAnd Xu Qinglang finally came to his senses at this moment. Too similar, really too similar! Although she wore a black veil covering her face, her voice and figure were truly identical to that woman!\n\nXu Qinglang immediately prepared to chase after her, but his hand was firmly gripped by Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What are you doing!\" Xu Qinglang yelled at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"No matter what relationship you have with her, you'd best not go.\"\n\n\"Impossible. There are some things I must get clear!\" Xu Qinglang insisted.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head somewhat helplessly, stood up, and said, \"Fine, I'll go with you.\"\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked out of the bookstore together. The woman was still walking ahead. Xu Qinglang quickly caught up and directly grabbed the woman's shoulders with both hands.\n\nThe woman's body trembled, and she asked, \"Little Quail, what do you mean by this?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's Adam's apple bobbed a few times, but he didn't know what to say. Should he talk about his own shameful escape?\n\n\"Your hand.\"\n\nAfter all, she was a woman he had been involved with. Although it was a casual fling, it was also a destiny of bodily fluid exchange.\n\nXu Qinglang reached out and grabbed the woman's wrist; it was covered in scars. \"This is ointment I specially brought from my hometown; it can remove scars.\"\n\nThe woman looked at Xu Qinglang with a half-smile, then looked at Zhou Ze standing beside her. Finally, her gaze fell back on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I didn't know you still had a relationship with him,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nThe woman nodded, indicating trust.\n\nThen she actively embraced Xu Qinglang tightly,\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned,\n\nThe other party was wearing a widow's clothes, and Zhou Ze was also beside them, so Xu Qinglang immediately felt a bit flustered.\n\nThen,\n\nA sound of dry retching ended the awkwardness.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nThe woman vomited.\n\nWhat she vomited was blood,\n\nSplashing all over Xu Qinglang,\n\nThen she collapsed weakly.\n\n\"What's going on! What is going on!\"\n\nXu Qinglang yelled, looking at his hands covered in blood.\n\nThe woman had already fallen to the ground, unconscious.\n\n\"She took poison,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then rescue her! Save her! What are you doing standing here? What are you doing!\"\n\nXu Qinglang said, shaking Zhou Ze's arm with one hand.\n\n\"Can't save her,\" Zhou Ze said very calmly.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She wanted to die herself.\"\n\n\"How could she want to die herself?\" Xu Qinglang asked in confusion.\n\n\"She must die.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and said, \"Call 120. She took poison herself; it has nothing to do with you. Or, you can burn some joss paper. Anyway, come back after you've dealt with her.\"\n\nTurning around, Zhou Ze walked back into the bookstore.\n\nBai Yingying saw Zhou Ze return alone and immediately asked, \"Boss, where's Pretty Xu?\"\n\n\"He has something to deal with.\"\n\n\"With that woman?\" Bai Yingying showed a look of sudden realization. \"That woman must have been smitten by his looks, abandoned you, and taken a liking to Pretty Xu, right?\"\n\n\"She died.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Died.\"\n\n\"How could she die?\"\n\n\"Committed suicide.\"\n\n\"How could she commit suicide?\"\n\nIn Bai Yingying's view, that woman was mercenary, money-worshipping, and pleasure-loving. How could such a person commit suicide?\n\n\"Why did Daji die?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't understand why the boss suddenly asked her this.\n\n\"You know the story of *Investiture of the Gods*, right?\"\n\n\"I know,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"Then, why did she die in the end?\"\n\n\"Because she was a bad woman! She harmed loyal and good people; her death was well-deserved.\"\n\n\"Hmm, at first, it was actually because King Zhou was disrespectful in Nuwa's temple, and Nuwa was enraged, so she sent down three foxes, including Daji, to bewitch King Zhou and accelerate the end of the Shang Dynasty's destiny.\n\nFinally, Daji succeeded; the Shang Dynasty perished. Daji originally thought she could go back to report on her mission, because her mission was indeed completed.\n\nJiang Ziya pursued and killed her, and she ran to find Nuwa. Nuwa said:\n\n'You truly deserve to die,\n\nI told you to bewitch King Zhou to hasten the end of the Shang Dynasty's destiny, but I didn't tell you to harm loyal officials and oppress the common people!'\n\nThen,\n\nNuwa killed Daji.\"\n\n\"This... Boss, do you mean...\"\n\n\"The design of the house, and the dried snake hidden in the house for several years, plus that old man actually ended up living in the house only with her.\"\n\n\"So that's it...\" Bai Yingying was deep in thought.\n\n\"So, she must die.\"\n___\n*   **Nanke dream (南柯一夢)**: A classic Chinese idiom referring to an illusory dream or a short-lived illusion of grandeur/prosperity.\n**   **Project Hope (希望工程)**: A well-known Chinese charity project that helps children in impoverished rural areas to attend school.\n***   **essence (精, jīng)**: Here, a pun where 'essence' can also refer to semen, used to create a blunt, humorous contrast with valuable money.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze closed his eyes. He couldn't sleep, but he liked the feeling of lying on the sofa by the glass window, enjoying the sunlight bathing his body.\n\nIn his previous life, he was always working non-stop, operating beside the operating table, finding it hard to take a break. In this life, he could make up for that.\n\nAfter listening to Zhou Ze's explanation, Bai Yingying seemed to understand and yet not understand. But at least one thing was certain: Zhou Ze had actually foreseen this long ago.\n\nAnd because of this, the Boss wouldn't bother with the remaining eight million final payment. No, it should actually be because the Boss knew that woman wouldn't come to a good end, so he was too lazy to go demand it from her; he wouldn't get it even if he tried.\n\nBai Yingying reached out and rubbed her hair, then stomped her foot and walked over to the bar counter.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was eating peanuts with the monkey, one for himself, one for the monkey. The man and the monkey ate with great relish. When Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying were explaining earlier, the old Taoist priest was also listening nearby. After listening, he smiled and walked away.\n\n\"Old Taoist priest, let me ask you a question. Did you understand what the Boss just said?\" Bai Yingying reached out and pushed the old Taoist priest's shoulder.\n\n\"Huh?\" The old Taoist priest turned his head, looked at Bai Yingying with some surprise, then said, \"Didn't the Boss just explain it to you?\"\n\n\"I didn't fully understand.\" Bai Yingying took a deep breath, then heavily exhaled it.\n\nDon't look at the old Taoist priest appearing very old, but he wasn't even half her age. Bai Yingying felt that she wasn't as perceptive as him on some matters.\n\nThis was actually natural. Although Bai Yingying was two hundred years old, she spent most of her time lying in a coffin, only talking and chatting with Mrs. Bai's ghost. So, essentially, she still retained the innocence of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl.\n\n\"Actually, this matter is very simple. It's like why Nuwa wanted to kill Daji. Saints, naturally, must be glorious and sacred. How could they have a blemish?\n\nSo, whether Daji completed her mission or not, she was actually destined to die. To bring down the Shang Dynasty, what else could she do but harm loyal officials and oppress the common people?\n\nYou know, in the *Investiture of the Gods*, even though King Zhou was immoral, the deities and forces helping him were not few. Jiang Ziya didn't have a smooth fight either. Therefore, Daji was definitely the best teammate.\n\nBut, in reality, from the moment Daji was sent out, Daji had already been sentenced to a suspended death sentence.\n\nIn ancient times, many superiors treated their 'tools' this way. When the superiors needed them, these tools would help them get rid of people they didn't want to see. After the mission was completed, it was a case of 'when the cunning hare is killed, the hounds are cooked.'*\n\nBreak the knife and show it to the world,\n\nLook,\n\nThe wicked elements have been executed by the great me; I am still so pure and untainted.'\"\n\n\"So this woman?\"\n\n\"Didn't the Boss say he found some array formation and that half-dried snake in the house?\n\nThat must have been placed by that woman. The old man was so rich, why did he end up living in the house at the ancestral home? And who was responsible for the design and layout of the house?\n\nClearly, the old man was ensnared. Although he brought it upon himself and didn't deserve sympathy, strictly speaking, someone led him into the trap step by step.\n\nEven if the snake in the sea hadn't had problems, it would have been difficult for it to come ashore to seek revenge, not to mention it already had problems. So, someone acted as a go-between, that's certain. Then who was the go-between? Only that woman was most suitable.'\"\n\n\"She's the snake's helper?\" Bai Yingying finished speaking and then shook her head. \"No, that's not right. The Boss and that snake had an agreement not to kill that woman. The snake agreed to it back then.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest looked at Zhou Ze, who was still \"feigning sleep\" over there, and said, \"It's not about snakes, snakes; this matter is very simple. The Sea God was displeased with that old man. Who knows if it was because the old man did something terrible when he made his fortune years ago, or perhaps he carried out many dirty deeds under the Sea God's name? Wasn't that old man involved in maritime smuggling?\n\nSo, that woman was like the Daji sent by the Sea God. In fact, this humble Taoist priest even thinks that the reason the old man was so selfish to an incomprehensible degree, even gritting his teeth to sacrifice his own family, old and young, might very well have been due to that woman's bewitchment.\n\nOr, to consider another possibility, the Sea God was displeased with that snake, feeling that if the snake became a spirit, it might affect him. So he set up a trap, incidentally ensnaring the snake as well. In the end, that snake, even at the cost of its life and spiritual annihilation, wanted to come ashore for revenge, and the Sea God was also happy to see it happen.\n\nIn short, no matter what, that woman must die. If she dies, the Sea God will still be the Sea God, continuing to maintain his greatness and sanctity.'\"\n\n\"Then, that woman is really pitiful.\" Bai Yingying sighed.\n\n\"There's nothing pitiful or not pitiful about it. This is fate; it cannot be changed. Look, even the Boss has come to terms with it.'\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up at this moment, glanced at the old Taoist priest and Bai Yingying who were muttering over there, and walked upstairs.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze walked to the window, lit a cigarette. On the windowsill, there was a scroll painting. This was bought back by the old Taoist priest at Zhou Ze's request the day after that incident.\n\nThe old Taoist priest also went to great lengths to find a similar Sea God portrait. After all, very few families hung his portrait at home.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and unrolled the scroll,\n\nlooked at the painting for a long time.\n\nFinally,\n\nhe took out a lighter, lit one corner of the painting, then placed it on the security bars of the windowsill, watching it slowly burn to ashes.\n\n\"What are you feeling sentimental about?\"\n\nThe little loli's voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Don't you know to knock before entering?\" Zhou Ze said with some dissatisfaction.\n\nBiu!\n\nThe little loli's figure appeared outside the door, then knocked on the door.\n\n\"Knock, knock, knock...\"\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nBiu!\n\nThe little loli's figure appeared inside the room again.\n\n\"Whose portrait did you burn?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\n\"Okay, I won't concern myself. I'm here because I received a message from that stupid zombie.'\"\n\n\"I said tomorrow.\"\n\n\"But he's going to Shanghai tonight, then taking a 10 PM flight back to Japan,\" the little loli reminded him.\n\n\"Why didn't you inform me about this earlier?\"\n\n\"I just found out about his flight information myself.\" The little loli looked as if to say, \"I'm already very fast.\"\n\n\"Then where is he now?\"\n\n\"One of three hiding spots, I guess. Before, he would rotate them daily. But today, I'm not sure if he'll continue to follow the pattern.\n\nHowever, I think it's more likely that he's in one particular spot.'\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because when I was tracking him, I found that in the house at that location, I could always sense another incredible aura. Although it was very faint and negligible, it had some special characteristics compared to the other two places.\n\nSince he's preparing to return to Japan, he must be planning to take some things back with him. Like his most successful research results?\"\n\nThe little loli finished speaking, took two steps back, and said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"In any case, you decide.\"\n\n\"Call Yingying, you and I will go to that place together.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze changed into a black hoodie and walked down the stairs. At the same time, he called out to Bai Yingying, who immediately followed him and got into the car, not even asking what they were going to do.\n\nAfter Bai Yingying got into the car, she found the little loli sitting beside her. This time, the little loli clearly only came with her soul body, not her physical body.\n\n\"Stupid zombie, you wouldn't even know if you were sold one day,\" the little loli mocked.\n\n\"You're jealous of me.\"\n\n\"Who would be stupid enough to that extent to be jealous of you?\"\n\n\"You are jealous of me.\"\n\n\"I would never be jealous of you!\"\n\n\"You're still jealous of me.\"\n\nThe little loli stopped talking. She felt it was too foolish to continue arguing on this topic.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and said to the little loli, \"Give me the address.\"\n\nThe little loli recited the address. After Zhou Ze successfully located it, he started the car. Not long after driving off, a call came in.\n\nZhou Ze initially wanted to hang up directly, but seeing it was Xu Qinglang, he answered it directly.\n\n\"Hello, how's it going over there?\"\n\n\"The old man's family, how many people are there in total?\"\n\n\"Why are you asking that?\"\n\n\"Just answer me.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes, recalled for a moment, and said, \"Including the old man, there are twenty-four.\"\n\n...\n\nMeanwhile, in the emergency room of the affiliated hospital, Xu Qinglang sat alone on a long bench in the corridor. He hung his head, looking at the tiles on the floor.\n\nFinally, the doctor walked out, and the police also came over.\n\nIt was probably because burning joss paper had avoided a lot of complications and trouble; the doctors and police didn't come to question Xu Qinglang about the woman's death. Of course, Xu Qinglang already had no suspicion in this matter, because the woman had left a suicide note selfie on her social media before committing suicide.\n\nThis suicide was a foregone conclusion.\n\nWatching the nurses push out the stretcher, covered with a white sheet, Xu Qinglang stood up, walked to the stretcher, and said:\n\n\"I want to see her again.\"\n\nThe two nurses exchanged glances, mistakenly thinking Xu Qinglang and this woman who committed suicide by poisoning were a couple. After a moment of hesitation, they nodded.\n\nXu Qinglang lifted the sheet, looked at the woman's plain face. She was still so beautiful.\n\nXu Qinglang had seen her charm and romance in bed,\n\nbut now, she was already cold.\n\nHe couldn't say he was sad, nor particularly grieved, just a little bit of loss and sighing.\n\nXu Qinglang picked up the woman's wrist, looked at the scars on her wrist, his finger gently tracing over them, counting them one by one. These scars must have been self-inflicted, one by one, starting from the last two months.\n\nShe seemed to have been preparing, and counting down to the end.\n\nXu Qinglang raised his head, walked to the corridor window, pushed open the window, letting the wind blow in.\n\nHe felt he shouldn't be sad, nor should he pity the woman lying there, but humans were just such emotional creatures.\n\nWhat she had done, what she had done to others, what her identity was, and so on,\n\nbut she had slept with him, so there was an instinctive feeling of goodwill and closeness.\n\nLetting out a long breath,\n\nXu Qinglang subconsciously pulled out a cigarette, then remembered he was in a hospital and put it back.\n\nHe had just counted.\n\nOn the woman's wrist,\n\nthere were,\n\ntwenty-four scars.\n\n---\n*Footnote: 'When the cunning hare is killed, the hounds are cooked' (狡兔死走狗烹): An idiom meaning that once a useful person or tool has served their purpose, they are discarded or eliminated.",

    "content": "Big figures have their big schemes, small figures have their small goals, and often, the two are not contradictory.\n\nZhou Ze had no way of knowing how much involvement that Sea God truly had in the wealthy old man's affairs. Perhaps, one day in the future, when Boss Zhou earns enough money and feels he can enjoy the atmosphere of buying a yacht and drifting around at sea, he might find an answer.\n\nFor now, what he needed to do was to strangle that Japanese priest, who kept causing trouble from beginning to end and had an unusually high presence, then send him to the crematorium to be cremated, and mix his ashes with curry chicken leg rice.\n\nFollowing the navigation, Zhou Ze drove to the entrance of an old residential compound. This compound was likely a jointly funded construction by some public institution a long time ago and was almost scheduled for demolition. Most of the residents had already moved out, making it appear somewhat dilapidated and messy, but there were still a few scattered households living there.\n\nTongcheng had already entered summer, but after walking in here, you could feel a slight chill. This wasn't the influence of any ghosts; it was just a special psychological suggestion given by a purely sparsely populated area.\n\n\"The room on the far left of the third floor. A young man who works in Tongcheng lives there, it's a rented apartment,\" the little loli explained.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, without much hesitation, and walked straight up. Although it wasn't certain whether the priest was inside, if the three of them just waited foolishly downstairs, it would be too silly.\n\nArriving on the third floor, the door was locked. Zhou Ze opened the door with his fingernail. After pushing it open and going inside, he found it to be spotless, clean to an incongruous degree.\n\nA place where people live truly couldn't be this clean; not even a speck of dust in every corner. Even the most considerate cleaning company would find it hard to achieve this level.\n\nThe walls,\nthe tiles,\nthe windowsills,\nand even the toilet bowl, all shimmered with a certain luster.\n\nBai Yingying looked at the situation inside, suddenly feeling worried. She knew her Boss was a clean freak, so she was afraid that if her Boss really liked the cleanliness here, he would also demand that she and Old Dao make the bookstore this clean.\n\nIf that were the case, in the future, besides sleeping with the Boss, she would only be able to constantly clean. She wouldn't even have time to play \"Eat Chicken\"*.\n\nNo one was in the room. A small one-bedroom apartment couldn't hide anyone either.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down, scraped his fingernail on the tile, then looked at his nail gap. There were some crystalline substances stuck in it.\n\nYes,\nthe reason this room was so clean was right here. It wasn't that it was truly cleaned well, but because there was a layer of oil-wax-like substance adhering to it, giving a deceptive visual impression of \"it's very clean here.\"\n\nEven the bedding on the bed had this substance adhering to it.\n\n\"He's not here,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"I'm not blind,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then shall we go to the next place?\"\n\nThe little loli shrugged. Finding that Japanese priest was the first task Zhou Ze had given her. She had monitored and tracked him for a long time, putting in a great deal of effort. If she didn't succeed when it was time to close the net, then all her previous hard work would be for nothing.\n\nA thankless task, doing so much only to fail at the last step. It would be better than the goodwill gained by that stupid zombie only knowing how to foolishly \"ying ying ying\"† next to someone.\n\n\"Slap.\"\nThe little loli slapped herself.\n\nWhat the hell am I thinking?\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Bai Yingying asked, looking at the little loli.\n\n\"Swatting a mosquito.\"\n\nBai Yingying shook her head.\nYou forgot you're in spirit form today. Swatting mosquitoes?\n\n\"That person should be back soon.\" Zhou Ze pointed towards the stove area.\n\nWhat was called a stove was actually just an induction cooker placed on a small table. Next to it were some condiments, as well as green onions, ginger, and garlic.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze noticed that in the entire room, only this area wasn't stained with that wax oil, meaning it had just been used. There were also chopped ingredients on the cutting board.\n\nPerhaps the person had finished chopping the ingredients while cooking, but then remembered they hadn't bought groceries.\n\nWell, this explanation is a bit silly, but for now, it seems there really is such a silly possibility.\n\n\"Let's wait outside for a bit longer.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed the door, then stood by the stairwell entrance.\n\nThe little loli's spirit slowly floated up, then she sat on the railing, her two small legs swinging back and forth, extremely innocent, natural, and cute.\n\nBai Yingying pouted. She didn't know why, but she was convinced that this little loli would eventually go down the path of competing for favor with her. Perhaps, this was a woman's intuition.\n\nSo, Bai Yingying was not to be outdone. She propped herself on the railing with both hands, as if looking at the distant scenery, but highlighting her curves behind her to the fullest, with a posture suggesting \"my humble home is now open for you\"‡.\n\nZhou Ze stood for a while, then sat down on the nearby steps, his back to the two competing women, and lit a cigarette.\n\nActually,\nsometimes, thinking about it,\nBoss Zhou wasn't doing badly in his previous life, but at thirty years old, he had always been a bachelor and had never even been in a relationship. There was a reason for this.\n\nEven back then, Doctor Lin, despite not having the temperament or being as well-developed as she was now, was definitely not bad, and she had a fangirl's admiration for him. Yet he couldn't even remember her name, purely treating her as a medical dog assigned to him for internship.\n\nIf a person like this isn't destined to be single forever,\nwho is?\n\nThe two women, one big and one small, were passionately competing to show off their beauty, but now it felt like a performance for a blind man. At that moment, the two women settled down.\n\nAfter finishing a cigarette, Zhou Ze thought of Old Xu. Anyway, they were just waiting for someone now, so Zhou Ze took the opportunity to call Old Xu.\n\nOld Xu was still very green in matters of relationships; he was a novice, so he inevitably got too emotionally invested many times. That woman had died, so he probably wasn't feeling very well inside.\n\nThe call connected. A weak \"Hello\" came from the other end.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I'm okay.\"\n\n\"Try to take it easy.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Some things, looking back, can only be considered an experience in your life, a memory. You'll understand later.\"\n\nSilence for a long time on the other end of the phone.\nZhou Ze thought Xu Qinglang was feeling sentimental and was touched by his comfort, but after a while, Xu Qinglang raised his voice slightly and responded:\n\n\"Are you a seasoned veteran?\"\n\nThis was a rhetorical question.\n\nWe're both novices. I've even lost my virginity, you're still a virgin. And you're comforting me?\n\n\"I'm married,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\nXu Qinglang was silent again on his end. He suddenly felt that Zhou Ze was truly the most shameless person he had ever met in his life.\n\n\"And I'm about to get divorced,\" Zhou Ze added.\n\nAt this moment, the BGM of \"Yi Jian Mei\"§ should be playing, to highlight Boss Zhou's melancholy and story.\n\nXu Qinglang remained silent. This level of shamelessness had just gone up another notch.\n\nForcibly adding drama, a backstory, and a sense of world-weariness to himself?\n\nFor a moment, Old Xu didn't even know how to retort.\n\n\"Anyway, try to take it easy.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze hung up the phone. He felt that if the call continued, an exasperated Old Xu would start to retaliate.\n\nHmm, this kind of feigned comfort is actually rubbing salt in the wound—that's what a true friend does!\n\n\"Someone's coming.\"\nBai Yingying said.\n\nBecause there were very, very few residents in this building, very few people passed by in front. Now a man in a white short-sleeved shirt was walking towards them, carrying a plastic bag. It was very likely the person they were looking for.\n\nZhou Ze turned sideways and looked downstairs.\n\nSure enough, that young man, carrying the plastic bag, began walking up this stairwell.\n\nThe man showed no abnormalities: a fair face, delicate skin, giving a feeling of a 'weakened version' of Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze felt there seemed to be a problem with his aesthetic sense. Other men habitually compare women outside to their own wives when looking at them.\n\nWhereas he now, when looking at men outside, habitually compared those seemingly decent \"pretty boys\" to Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe plastic bag in the man's hand was heavy. After he came up, he first saw Zhou Ze sitting on the steps, then he saw Bai Yingying standing by the railing.\n\nFinally,\nhis gaze fell upon the little loli sitting on the railing, swinging her legs,\nand he specifically took a few extra glances at the little loli, a covetous look appearing on his face.\n\n\"That's him,\" the little loli said.\n\nShe was in spirit form.\nAnyone who could see her definitely had a problem.\n\nBai Yingying stepped forward, attempting to grab the man's shoulder. The man abruptly retreated a step, throwing the plastic bag. Bai Yingying reached out and swatted the plastic bag away. As a result, over ten pig trotters spilled out and rolled onto the ground.\n\n\"Click...\"\nBai Yingying's fingers clasped the man's shoulder, but at that moment, the man didn't retreat but advanced instead.\n\nOnly a \"buzz\" sound was heard. Bai Yingying didn't move; her strength was much greater than his, but the man's momentum and reaction caught Bai Yingying off guard for a moment.\n\nThe fingers clasped around his shoulder instantly loosened.\nSo slick,\nnot only was his skin slick,\nbut even the clothes on his body were slick!\n\nThe man flipped over, wanting to jump over the stairs to escape, but Zhou Ze, sitting on the steps, reached out at that moment. His fingernails instantly grew long, piercing into the man's calf.\n\n\"Ah!\"\nThe man let out a shriek and fell to the ground. Zhou Ze stepped forward and directly clasped his fingers around the man's neck.\n\nThe man's body kept twitching, probably because the damage from Zhou Ze's fingernail was still taking effect.\n\nThe little loli floated up lightly and came before the man.\n\nThe man rolled his eyes. He looked at Zhou Ze, his gaze filled with fear and terror. He seemed to want to say something, but he couldn't even speak properly. He could only continuously make sounds from his throat:\n\n\"Ah ah... ah ah... ah ah...\"\n\n\"Where is that Japanese priest?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Ah ah... ah ah... ah ah...\"\n\n\"Can you speak properly? If you can't speak, I'll just have to finish you off.\"\n\n\"Ah ah... ah ah... ah ah...\"\n\nThe little loli lowered her head at this moment and placed her hand on the man's throat, as if listening to something.\n\n\"What is he saying?

    "content": "“Ahhh… ahhh… ahhh…”\n\nThe young man was tied up in the corner, unable to move, but still kept shouting at Zhou Ze.\n\nWhat he was shouting, Zhou Ze already knew from Little Loli’s previous translation.\n\n“Ahhh… ahhh… ahhh…”\n\n“Muffle him.” Zhou Ze was getting impatient.\n\nHe’d just gotten a million [yuan], before he even had a chance to enjoy it, and now a son pops out.\n\nTsk tsk.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, picked up a rag, and directly stuffed it into the man’s mouth. The man couldn’t make a sound now, but his excitement was still evident.\n\nIt was as if the Ugly Duckling had found the Swan family’s home; his joy was truly overflowing, as if he couldn’t wait to burrow into Zhou Ze’s embrace and rub against him.\n\n“What exactly is this thing?” Bai Yingying asked Little Loli beside her.\n\nLittle Loli’s nose pointed upwards, she let out a soft “Hmph,” showing an attitude of not speaking to people with low IQs.\n\n“What exactly is going on?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“It’s obvious. You said your ashes were stolen before. Setting aside the extreme possibility that the Japanese priest is your fanatic fan and wants to collect your ashes to take home, the rest is actually easy to guess. That Japanese priest knew some of your secrets and started to research them. For example, cultivating zombies similar to you. Actually, the Japanese really have that tradition. For instance, many so-called demon gods in Japanese mythological history are hybridized; a bit of me in you, a bit of you in me, their characteristics are very messy.”\n\nBai Yingying looked at Little Loli, who was explaining non-stop, and her sense of crisis intensified once again.\n\n“Heh.” Zhou Ze let out a dry laugh.\n\nUsing his own ashes to develop his own derivatives? Thinking about it, it was quite interesting.\n\n“Actually, I’ve always been curious about one thing.” Little Loli tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze, “You don’t seem curious about your past secrets at all.”\n\n“What do I need to be curious about? I am who I am.”\n\n“Mm-hmm, a different kind of fireworks.”*\n\nLittle Loli stood up, her figure floating, passing through the door, “I’ll go out and check. If that priest comes back here, I should be able to spot him early.”\n\nInside the room, only Zhou Ze, Bai Yingying, and the captive remained.\n\nBai Yingying pointed at the captive and asked, “Boss, your son... how should we deal with this guy?”\n\n“Is there still a chance to save him?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“He’s actually been deeply infected with corpse poison. If it had been at the very beginning, there might have been a way to solve it, but now, it’s basically unsolvable. Moreover, if left unchecked, he could really turn completely into a walking dead, with an instinctive urge and craving for fresh human blood and flesh. He’s not a zombie, nor does he qualify to be part of our sequence.”\n\n“But he still seems to have some sentience now.”\n\n“That’s just superficial, Boss. From the moment he started calling you 'Dad,' it meant that the original him, that soul, that consciousness, had already been annihilated. He’s now more like an infant, relearning and perceiving this world from a new perspective, and because he has countless ties to you, he instinctively feels close to you.”\n\n“Then dispose of him.” Zhou Ze said.\n\nSince he couldn’t be saved, it was better to deal with him. Keeping him was like keeping a ticking time bomb that could harm ordinary people. At this point, Zhou Ze wouldn't be so soft-hearted.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, reached out, and grabbed the man’s neck. Then, as if she thought of something, she said to Zhou Ze: “Boss, could you turn your head away and not look?” Bai Yingying didn’t want the Boss to see her crude side.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head away, and then only heard a “crunch.” When he looked back, he saw that the man’s head had already been twisted off by Bai Yingying.\n\nA high school girl, holding a human head in her hand, was still curiously looking at the wound on the neck. This scene looked very eerie. Innocent youthfulness mixed with spine-tingling horror.\n\nThe head was twisted off, but no blood splattered out. It was clear that the blood vessels at the severed wound were long clogged and shriveled, with strands of black threads wrapped around inside.\n\nIt was also at this moment that a wisp of black mist sprayed out from the nostrils of the head in Bai Yingying’s hand. A man’s face condensed within the black mist. He looked towards Zhou Ze, expressing gratitude, and then slowly dissipated.\n\nHe was free, truly free. But because of his special encounter, he also lost the chance to re-enter reincarnation. Yet, this kind of end was actually a form of happiness.\n\nZhou Ze gently rubbed the tip of his nose, his breathing becoming slightly heavier.\n\nTo be honest, his desire to see that Japanese [person] dead had grown stronger. From the moment the other party stole his ashes, many of the things he had experienced recently had continuously refreshed his hatred toward that Japanese priest.\n\nBai Yingying put down the head and washed her hands at the faucet.\n\n“Boss, we must kill that priest. He actually wants to add hybridized breeds to our kind, and that person, he was so pitiful,” Bai Yingying said seriously.\n\nHer words sounded as if she was worried that her and Zhou Ze’s descendants would be impure.\n\n“He’s here! I’ll tie him down, you guys come down!”\n\nLittle Loli let out a sharp howl that ordinary people couldn’t hear, and directly plunged down from the balcony.\n\nThat Japanese priest was no ordinary person. Letting him simply walk down the stairs and into this room on his own was too risky; heaven knew if he would discover something amiss beforehand and just run away.\n\nSo Little Loli charged straight in. What she had to do was to engage the opponent at all costs, buying time for Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying to surround him.\n\nThe Japanese priest stood there, having just sneezed. He took out a handkerchief and wiped his nose; his eyes were a bit red, clearly indicating a cold.\n\nBut just as he put down his handkerchief, a large tongue appeared in his line of sight!\n\nThe priest quickly retreated. The tongue swept horizontally repeatedly, drawing a circle around him, trapping him inside.\n\n“It’s you again! You’ve followed and watched me time and again, do you really think I don’t know? I originally thought you were just fulfilling your duties as a local ghost officer’s surveillance, but I didn’t expect you to actually make a move. I’m a living person; you can only manage the dead!”\n\nThe priest was composed and at ease. Clearly, he had long been aware of Little Loli’s surveillance.\n\nLittle Loli remained silent, her feet hovering in the air, her mouth wide open, her long tongue twitching continuously.\n\n“I’m leaving Tongcheng today. You could have just turned a blind eye as before. Although the Underworld is strict and inviolable, do you, a mere ghost officer, truly have the face to represent the Underworld?!”\n\nThe priest formed hand seals with both hands, stepping out Yu steps.** Immediately, gusts of fierce winds raged, and Little Loli’s tongue began to break, then shattered into pieces after holding on for a short while.\n\nLittle Loli closed her mouth, her lips twitched, and then her body began to retreat.\n\n“Scared already?” The priest smiled faintly, with a hint of reserve.\n\nBut in the next moment, his expression changed. A white figure charged directly towards him.\n\nThe priest turned his hands over, and two scalpels appeared in his hands. He sliced directly at the rapidly approaching white figure!\n\n“Clang!” The sound of metal striking came. This was the sound of the scalpels cutting into the other party’s body. The priest’s gaze narrowed. To possess such a formidable physical body—this was a zombie!\n\nBai Yingying took both of the priest’s cuts head-on, while her shoulder slammed hard into the priest’s chest.\n\n“Bang!” The priest was sent flying backward, landing heavily on the ground.\n\nBai Yingying did not continue the pursuit; instead, she stood her ground, as if calming the malevolent energy within her body. The opponent’s scalpels carried sacred power, stimulating the circulation of the malevolent energy within her. In comparison, the physical damage was secondary.\n\nAfter landing, the priest quickly got back to his feet, propping himself up with one hand. Little Loli appearing here didn’t surprise him; the two of them had maintained a mutual understanding of minding their own business for some time.\n\nBut the appearance of this female zombie made an ominous premonition arise in his heart. Turning his head, the priest indeed saw Zhou Ze had already appeared not far behind him.\n\n“Heh…” Zhou Ze reached out and squeezed his wrist, walking step by step towards the priest.\n\n“Sir, I think there might be a slight misunderstanding between us. You can listen to my explanation.”\n\nZhou Ze didn’t respond, continuing to walk towards him.\n\n“Sir, you should know the general course of events, but I truly bear no ill will towards you. I am just very curious about your past; I just want to help you find your past and unlock your secrets.”\n\nZhou Ze still didn’t respond, continuing to close the distance with the priest.\n\n“Sir, you must understand my sincere devotion. You know, I have always admired Chinese culture and revered Chinese myths and legends. This is the attractive and unifying power of culture. I am deeply impressed by Chinese culture and am willing to pour my heart and soul into understanding it.”\n\nZhou Ze still didn’t respond, continuing to walk forward. At the same time, long, inky black fingernails slowly grew from Zhou Ze’s ten fingers.\n\n“Everything I’m saying is true. In my opinion, you are also a part of Chinese culture, so I can’t help but want to study you. Just look at how fluent my Chinese is, and you’ll know how fascinated I am by Chinese culture. Don’t believe me? I can even sing Chinese songs for you! Don’t you Chinese people love it the most when foreigners speak Chinese and sing Chinese songs, and then you feel full of pride and joy deep down? You get so ecstatic!”***\n\nThe priest took a deep breath. At first, he still held a sliver of hope, but seeing Zhou Ze continuously approach him step by step without hesitation, he simply stopped pretending.\n\nHe inverted the two scalpels and plunged them into his palms. Blood flowed out, soaking the scalpels.\n\nThe priest slowly dropped his earlier smile and said in a low voice: “I’ve said so much, you should at least say a few words before you start, otherwise, it’ll be so awkward for me.”\n\n“Baka.”**** Zhou Ze.\n\n“……” The priest.\n\n——————\n\nIn my memory, for many, many years, no supernatural-genre book has made it into the top ten of the monthly vote ranking.\n\nLast month, we were number one on the new book monthly vote chart!\n\nEven with me saying that after two consecutive new book periods, my body couldn’t take it and needed rest, and that I would be laid-back and not contend for rankings, by the end of the month, we still made it to tenth place on the overall monthly vote chart.\n\nWe have already created many records for the supernatural genre, so let’s push forward one more step. With every step, we are creating new records!\n\nMonthly votes, please give monthly votes!\n___\n*   “A different kind of fireworks” (不一樣的煙火): A common Chinese internet phrase meaning someone unique, special, or eccentric.\n**   Yu steps (禹步): An ancient ritualistic pacing method in Daoism, often used in incantations or spiritual practices.\n*** “You get so ecstatic!” (嗨得不要不要的): A modern Chinese internet slang phrase indicating extreme excitement or pleasure.\n**** “Baka” (八嘎): A common Japanese expletive, roughly meaning “idiot,” “stupid,” or “dammit.”",

    "content": "For a long time, oh no, to be exact, for his entire previous life, Zhou Ze had been someone who couldn't fight.\n\nHe hadn't learned kung fu, nor had he practiced Taekwondo; he wasn't even very clear on basic forms or moves.\n\nBecause of this, when he first met the awakened Bai Yingying, to use Xu Qinglang's words, Bai Yingying stood in the bookstore, her overbearing aura radiating, like a big burly man.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze just used his fingernails, charging up like a scorned wife attacking a mistress, scratching Bai Yingying until her mind shattered, directly causing her to transform from Bai Yingying to Bai Yingying (whimpering Bai)¹.\n\nIn the past six months as a Ghost Messenger, Zhou Ze had become aware of some of his own issues, but he hadn't sought to improve.\n\nThere were many various reasons for this, but of course, the biggest reason was... laziness.\n\n\"One good trick, and you can conquer the world\"²; when encountering ghosts and ordinary people, his fingernails were already sufficient.\n\nEven when facing slightly stronger opponents, he could \"activate invincible mode\"³.\n\nAlthough he knew very little about how this \"invincible mode\" came about, adhering to the lazy principle of \"go with the flow\"⁴, Zhou Ze used it quite happily. The only side effect was that he would be paralyzed for a long time after using it.\n\nThus, even though he knew he couldn't fight, Zhou Ze didn't flinch when facing a fight, and he gradually began to develop the misconception that \"I'm very good at fighting.\"\n\nThe Father stepped forward, surgical knife in hand, arm swinging at extreme speed, the blade pointing directly at Zhou Ze's brow.\n\nZhou Ze didn't dodge. \"No matter how many paths you come from, I'll only go one way\"⁵. His right hand shot directly towards the Father's face.\n\nThe result of this move was that the Father's surgical knife could pierce Zhou Ze's temple, but the Father's own head would also have five \"skylights\"⁶ opened by Zhou Ze to let some air in.\n\nThe Father hadn't expected Zhou Ze to be so resolute, daring to play a game of \"trading lives\"⁷ with such ferocity, especially when he had the advantage of an ambush.\n\nThen,\n\nThe Father chickened out.\n\nHe withdrew his hand, his body retreating. Zhou Ze didn't grasp the Father's face, merely grazed his chest.\n\n\"Clap!\"\n\nA black mist swept out like a whip, flipping the Father to the ground. Although he quickly rolled and stood up again, propping himself on his knees, he was clearly at a disadvantage in this exchange.\n\nBai Yingying stared, mouth agape, at her boss's ferocity. Vaguely, she seemed to recall the terror of being violently... *handled* by her boss when they first met in the bookstore.\n\nThat was truly her and her boss's \"life if it were only the first encounter\"⁸.\n\nThe little loli watched from the side, chewing her tongue like chewing gum, then suddenly burst into a chuckle.\n\nShe had figured it out: Zhou Ze actually couldn't fight at all.\n\nHow pathetic, this idiotic zombie beside her was still infatuated⁹.\n\nDon't you know your boss could really die at the hands of that shitty Father if you don't help?!\n\nCan't you have some common sense about how tough your boss really is¹⁰?\n\nThe Father sprang up again, his speed immense. This time, he didn't dare charge directly at Zhou Ze, opting instead for a flanking maneuver. After all, he was somewhat intimidated by Zhou Ze's \"wide-open\" fighting style and couldn't quite grasp his rhythm.\n\nMoreover, he knew that Zhou Ze was truly terrifying in his zombie state. He had fought Zhou Ze in that state before, breaking several ribs, and the injuries were anything but light. And back then, Zhou Ze had just battled against Qingyi Niangniang¹¹, a temple deity.\n\nJust like that, the Father and Boss Zhou fought back and forth, truly looking like a real fight: you advance, I retreat; you retreat, I advance; you flank, I flank—how exciting!\n\nZhou Ze was brimming with confidence, while the Father was trembling with fear, actually producing the style of a master's duel. At least in terms of special effects and action choreography, it was more aesthetically pleasing to the audience than the contemporary so-called martial arts masters' direct, head-down brawling¹².\n\nFinally, Bai Yingying came to her senses and charged in again, joining the fray.\n\nThe little loli also didn't dare continue to \"sit on the mountain watching tigers fight\"¹³. Although she dearly wished the Father could instantly kill Zhou Ze \"with lightning speed\"¹⁴, thus gaining her freedom, she didn't dare gamble. If Zhou Ze didn't die and discovered she had been \"watching the fire from the other side of the bank\"¹⁵, then she would be the one to die.\n\nBai Yingying's fighting style was more direct than Zhou Ze's. She actively took on damage for Zhou Ze, single-mindedly protecting her master¹⁶. Coupled with her truly excellent physical conditioning, she didn't lose out even when directly clashing with the Father, which gave Zhou Ze more opportunities and space to attack. Moreover, the little loli repeatedly launched sneak attacks as support, making the Father truly miserable.\n\nAfter receiving several hideous wounds from Zhou Ze's scratches, the Father's gaze sharpened. Blood once again coated his surgical knives, and he plunged both blades into the concrete ground, simultaneously forming hand seals. Instantly, a barrier appeared. The little loli, during a sneak attack, crashed directly into the barrier, causing her soul to become unstable, forcing her to retreat.\n\nThis barrier had a suppressive effect on all dark-type entities. Strictly speaking, none of the three—Zhou Ze included—were of the \"righteous path,\" and thus all would be suppressed. The little loli knew when to quit, resolutely refusing to give herself a chance to be severely injured.\n\nBut Bai Yingying was much more straightforward.\n\nShe relentlessly crashed into the barrier. Even though malicious aura dissipated from her body with each impact, clearly causing her great pain, she still gritted her teeth and continued to ram it, intending to forcibly shatter this barrier!\n\n\"Silly big girl,\" the little loli scoffed disdainfully.\n\nIt was at this moment that Zhou Ze also plunged his ten fingers into the ground. Black light began to emerge in his eyes, and then, his hands slowly started to pull upwards!\n\nThe Father's surgical knives, stuck in the ground, slowly began to be drawn out by an invisible force. Combined with Bai Yingying's relentless crashing, the barrier started to become precarious.\n\nBeads of sweat the size of beans appeared on the Father's forehead. The corner of his eye began to dart around, clearly indicating that fighting in this situation would be very difficult, especially since he knew he was already so passive without Zhou Ze even \"unleashing his ultimate move\"¹⁷. If he continued to hold out, he would only sink deeper, possibly even meeting his end here.\n\nSo, he planned to slip away, to find an opportunity to escape.\n\nBlood began to seep from Zhou Ze's ten fingers, as if they had been cut by sharp blades. At the same time, Zhou Ze growled at the little loli beside him:\n\n\"If he doesn't die today, you'll die in his place.\"\n\nA threat,\n\nA blatant threat¹⁸!\n\nThe little loli froze for a moment. She hadn't expected Zhou Ze to say such a thing. All along, though she was Zhou Ze's subordinate and had been subdued by him, her proud and arrogant¹⁹ self was unwilling to truly become a servant like Bai Yingying. She had always maintained her arrogance, constantly reminding herself that she was different from that silly girl Bai Yingying!\n\nBut Zhou Ze's words completely shattered her pride.\n\nThis could be translated to mean: \"You are my dog. If you can't catch the prey, then this dog can be boiled and eaten.\"\n\nIt was very realistic, tearing apart all tenderness.\n\nThe little loli cast an angry glance at Zhou Ze; she now wished she could kill this man directly, tearing him into ten thousand pieces!\n\nBut she still flashed, transforming into a black light, and charged directly at the Father.\n\n\"Rise!\"\n\nZhou Ze forcibly pulled out his bloody hands.\n\nThe Father's surgical knives, stuck in the ground, immediately flew out.\n\nBai Yingying delivered a crash, which the Father barely blocked by folding his arms, but the little loli appeared directly behind the Father, taking the opportunity to stab her entire soul into his body.\n\n\"Ahhhhhh!!!!!\"\n\nFrom the Father's mouth, issued the painful screams of both a man and a little girl.\n\nBai Yingying delivered an elbow strike, viciously smashing into the Father's chest. The Father was flung away like a fly. Then, Bai Yingying quickly followed up, directly pinning the Father down, while relentlessly smashing her fists into his chest.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nContinuous heavy blows.\n\nThudding sounds echoed non-stop throughout the complex, but the Father's body displayed an unusual toughness. Under the continuous pounding of Bai Yingying's zombie fists, it only emitted sounds of bone grinding. If it had been an ordinary person, they would have likely been beaten into meat paste by Bai Yingying long ago, and the kind of very chewy meat paste.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nJust then, the little loli who had burrowed into the Father's body shot out. Her soul was somewhat fragmented, much dimmer and more transparent than before.\n\nShe pointed at the Father and said, \"His body has a problem!\"\n\nYes,\n\nThis body definitely had a problem.\n\nBai Yingying, who had been fiercely pounding him, felt it deeply; it was as if she were eating a piece of beef full of sinew that she just couldn't chew through!\n\n\"Hoo...\" The Father seemed to have made some kind of decision. His eyes began to be replaced by crimson, and his muscles started to atrophy.\n\nBai Yingying was stunned.\n\n\"Holy crap, why does this feel so familiar!\"\n\nThe Father seemed to be in great pain, and it was clear he was forced to do this, as he knew his research hadn't succeeded at all and was still in the exploratory, failure stage.\n\nBut he had no choice.\n\nOtherwise, he would soon be beaten by this female zombie into elastic meat paste that, wrapped in a bit of flour, could be kneaded into \"Pissing Beef Balls\"²⁰ and thrown into a hotpot to cook.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nThe Father's body stiffened. Bai Yingying slammed a fist into his head.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe Father crashed down again, bounced off the ground after creating a crater, and directly slammed into Bai Yingying, sending her reeling back several steps.\n\n\"Ugh... Ugh...\" The Father slowly stood up, his figure swaying. His face was half greenish-blue, half gray, making him look like Ouyang Feng who had practiced Toad Skill²¹. In short, his entire being was filled with chaos and strangeness.\n\nBai Yingying prepared to charge again but was held back by Zhou Ze's hand.\n\n\"You rest for a bit. Don't injure yourself too severely.\"\n\nHearing this, Bai Yingying obediently nodded, but looked at Zhou Ze with some worry, implying: \"Boss, can you handle it alone?\"\n\nZhou Ze seemed very nonchalant. He took a few more steps forward,\n\n\"Ahem...\"\n\nThen lightly coughed a few times, as if to attract the Father's attention.\n\nThe Father's eyes fixed on Zhou Ze, his expression constantly shifting:\n\nFirst hatred,\n\nThen rage,\n\nFollowed by confusion,\n\nAnd finally bewilderment.\n\n\"What did you call me?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe Father tilted his head, continuing to stare at Zhou Ze, his throat making \"gurgle-gurgle\" sounds.\n\nHe covered his mouth, tightly covering it; he seemed to be trying to stop something,\n\nBut the desire was bursting forth, an impulse that couldn't be stopped.\n\nZhou Ze opened his arms,\n\nHis expression gentle,\n\n\"Come,\n\nDaddy loves you.\"\n\nFinally,\n\nThe Father couldn't hold it in, couldn't resist any longer.\n\nHis experimental subject had one major flaw that he wasn't aware of: he had only stolen Zhou Ze's ashes from his previous life for the experiment, but hadn't managed to capture Zhou Ze himself to participate!\n\nFinally, the hand covering his mouth slipped away,\n\nAnd the Father excitedly shouted:\n\n\"Otousan...\"²² (Daddy)\n\n***\n\nPS:\n\nNow ranked 9th on the total monthly ticket list,\n\n5th in the fan team.\n\nBut Long believes,\n\nWe can go higher!\n\nFor those of you who still have monthly tickets, please cast your votes for Long!\n\n---\n¹ Bai Yingying (whimpering Bai): The character's name changes from 莺莺 (Yīngyīng), implying a graceful bird, to 嘤嘤 (yīngyīng), which describes a whimpering or crying sound, emphasizing her emotional distress.\n² \"One good trick, and you can conquer the world\" (一招鲜，吃遍天下): A Chinese idiom meaning that having one unique or excellent skill is enough to succeed everywhere.\n³ \"Activate invincible mode\" (开无双): A term borrowed from video games, particularly hack-and-slash games like Dynasty Warriors (无双 is the Chinese title), meaning to enter a state of overwhelming power or invincibility.\n⁴ \"Go with the flow\" (既来之则安之): A Chinese idiom meaning to accept and be content with what has happened, or to adapt to circumstances.\n⁵ \"No matter how many paths you come from, I'll only go one way\" (任你几路来，我只一路去): A strategic idiom implying a direct, unyielding approach regardless of the opponent's varied tactics.\n⁶ \"Skylights\" (天窗): Used figuratively here to mean gaping wounds or holes, implying Zhou Ze would disfigure the Father's head with his nails.\n⁷ \"Trading lives\" (以命换命): An idiom describing a desperate fighting style where both parties risk their lives by exchanging blows, often leading to mutual destruction.\n⁸ \"Life if it were only the first encounter\" (人生若只是初见): A twist on a famous line from a Qing dynasty poem (人生若只如初见), which usually evokes nostalgia for a simpler past.

    "content": "There was a story like this: A highly skilled blacksmith first forged an extremely sturdy cage, then crafted an equally sturdy iron lock.\n\nHe then stepped into the cage he had built, carefully feeling its sturdiness, and the lock hanging above suddenly fell into place.\n\nHe was trapped inside, and because his shop was quite remote and business wasn't very good, by the time he was discovered, he had long since died of thirst or starvation inside the cage.\n\nAnd the Japanese priest before them, like the blacksmith in the story, meticulously crafted an iron cage and an iron lock, only to end up locking himself in.\n\nThe priest, after all, was different from the young man whose head Bai Yingying had just twisted off upstairs to end his suffering; he was a bit more advanced, with a stronger tolerance.\n\nTherefore,\n\nHe still retained some of his sanity.\n\nWhen that young man called Zhou Ze \"Papa,\" his jubilation, his blossoming heart, his intense excitement, were truly genuine expressions, moving one to tears.\n\nBut when this Japanese priest called out \"Otousan,\"¹ it was with extreme awkwardness, shyness, shame, repression, and a desire to resist yet also to welcome, somewhat like the female lead in some melodramatic TV dramas who has been drugged with an aphrodisiac by a villain.\n\n\"Otousan!\"\n\nAfter calling out once, a flicker of terror appeared in the Japanese priest's eyes. How could things have turned out this way? He had a deeply ominous premonition, and that premonition told him that events were unfolding towards an extreme more terrifying than death itself.\n\nWith things reaching this point, the situation took a turn for the better²; at least from Zhou Ze's perspective, that was certainly the case.\n\nHe continued to hold his arms open, and in response to that \"Otousan,\" he nodded slightly, acknowledging it:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWith a response came interaction, and with interaction, that impulse grew even stronger!\n\nThe Japanese priest's eyes were wide open; he could no longer control himself.\n\n\"Otousan!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Otousan!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Otousan! Otousan! Otousan!!………………\"\n\nThe first time was awkward, not entirely pure, carrying a bit of inhibition and sharp pangs of discomfort.\n\nThe second time was much easier, after all, with the first time as a foundation.\n\nAfter that, everything became second nature; the struggling person gave up struggling, because they had already gone numb.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down, clapping his hands at the priest, as if teasing a Corgi at home, calling it over to rub its belly.\n\nThe priest stumbled towards Zhou Ze, then likewise, truly lay down in front of Zhou Ze. His facial muscles twitched and trembled; his subconscious told him he absolutely couldn't do this, but that heartfelt impulse and intimacy from deep within directly shattered his sanity.\n\n\"Good boy, no more struggling.\"\n\nZhou Ze said softly to him.\n\nThe priest slowly closed his eyes.\n\nHe, somewhat resigned himself to fate.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze showed no subsequent warmth; his sharp fingernail directly pierced into the priest's crown of the head.\n\nThe priest's body began to tremble incessantly, but his face revealed a sense of enjoyment.\n\nAll graces, whether thunder or rain, come from the sovereign,³\n\nThis saying was perfectly exemplified in him.\n\nThe reason Bai Yingying was so respectful to Zhou Ze now was actually the same: in human society, one can still shout the slogan, \"Are kings, nobles, generals, and ministers born with a special lineage?\"⁴ But in the genes of other species, the obedience of a subordinate to a superior is an ingrained habit, difficult to change and difficult to resist.\n\nThe little loli walked up to Zhou Ze, looking at the priest below who was both enjoying and being tormented. She pursed her lips and still spoke:\n\n\"Not considering actually taking a godson? Anyway, the gap between you and the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old Lord isn't that big.\"\n\n\"This son, I cannot afford to have.\" Zhou Ze replied thus.\n\nYes, taking this Japanese priest home, even if not as a son but as a pet, seemed like a good decision. After all, there were already many strange people in his bookstore; one more priest wouldn't be out of the question.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't have a hoarding disorder, and this priest was too dangerous. Zhou Ze wasn't sure how long this \"father-son\" relationship could last, nor when the priest might \"wake up\" on his own.\n\nKeeping a dog, that's fine; a dog at least understands loyalty. But keeping a venomous snake, that would be playing with fire too much; he might really get bitten by it one day.\n\nThe priest's body slowly began to blacken. The black qi from Zhou Ze's fingertip continuously poured into his body, furiously destroying his flesh.\n\nThis torment lasted for about twenty-odd seconds. The priest stopped moving; his entire body had turned a dark bluish-black.\n\nZhou Ze withdrew his fingernail, but at the same time, he stretched out his other hand and clenched his palm tightly.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nA black soul was seized by Zhou Ze, bearing the priest's face, twisted, struggling, and filled with boundless rage.\n\nBecause he found it hard to imagine that his ultimate end would be like this: proactively delivering himself to his opponent in such a humiliating manner, offering his neck to await execution.\n\nSuch an ending was too humiliating and too painful; he was truly unwilling, deeply, deeply unwilling.\n\nHe still had other methods, and other secret arts. Even if the situation was truly critical, he wasn't without a chance to escape death.\n\n\"Yingying.\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\n\"Here, Boss.\"\n\n\"Find some gasoline and burn his corpse for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nZhou Ze casually pulled a small stack of hell money from his pocket and burned it with a lighter.\n\nThis would ensure that when he disposed of the body in the neighborhood later, no outsiders would come to see, nor would anyone inadvertently trespass.\n\nHell money could be used to exchange for money, but it could also neutralize trouble. This kind of usage, where one hadn't done anything wrong but simply wanted to avoid trouble, had always gone smoothly.\n\nThe priest's soul continued to struggle incessantly in Zhou Ze's palm. After struggling for a while, he began to plead again.\n\nFor someone of his caliber, even in death, his soul was somewhat different from that of ordinary people.\n\nZhou Ze paid him no mind, and kept holding onto him.\n\nBai Yingying found the gasoline, placed it on the ground, and then silently walked out again.\n\nA moment later, Bai Yingying returned, carrying a barbecue grill. She set the grill down nearby.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned,\n\nthe little loli was also stunned,\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the barbecue grill and asked:\n\n\"What's this for?\"\n\nBai Yingying looked a bit bewildered, then raised her head and asked Zhou Ze: \"Boss, aren't we barbecuing him?\"\n\n\"You like to eat this?\" Zhou Ze pointed at the Japanese priest's corpse nearby.\n\nBai Yingying shook her head. \"Boss, didn't you say you wanted to mix his ashes with rice?\"\n\nAs she spoke, Bai Yingying even pulled out a bag from nearby.\n\n\"I even specially bought rice.\"\n\n\"…………\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli snorted with laughter beside them.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to caress Bai Yingying's head and softly ask her if she was doing it on purpose.\n\nBut he decided against it, because Bai Yingying was genuinely the kind of person who might take his \"exaggerated metaphors\" uttered in anger literally.\n\nAt least, he had no reason to blame her for this.\n\n\"I still had the second half of that sentence to say.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Huh?\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"I was going to take his ashes, mix them with rice, and then make my Yingying eat them as a late-night snack.\"\n\nBai Yingying's expression instantly became priceless.\n\n\"Just burn him first, then find a public restroom and dump the ashes.\" Zhou Ze stopped teasing the female zombie.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be blamed for taking the matter of ashes so seriously, because ordinary people couldn't experience the situation of having their ashes stolen and then seeking revenge on the thief.\n\nSo, let's handle this in a special way: since you stole my ashes, I'll retaliate with yours, tit for tat.\n\nBai Yingying began pouring gasoline over the priest's corpse. The priest's soul at this moment was anxiously hopping around, but Zhou Ze just made him watch from the side.\n\n\"Boss, I'm lighting the fire now.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nBai Yingying lit the fire, and the priest's corpse began to burn. For a moment, the smell of roasting meat wafted through the air.\n\nA sense of despair emanated from the priest's soul.\n\nHowever, as it burned, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed something amiss and took a step forward.\n\nBai Yingying also let out a surprised and confused sound, because she saw the corpse in the fire slowly sit up.\n\n\"Boss, do corpses do this when they're burned?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze.\n\nWhy ask Zhou Ze?\n\nBecause Zhou Ze had experience, of course.\n\nActually, theoretically speaking, a corpse suddenly twitching or sitting up during cremation could all be explained scientifically.\n\nZhou Ze didn't have time to explain,\n\nbecause soon, no scientific explanation would be needed.\n\nNot only did the corpse sit up,\n\nbut it also, for crying out loud, stood up.\n\nHere, take the pen,\n\nhow do you explain this now?\n\nFrom the flames, the corpse walked out. It still had flames on its body, still burning. Its clothes had long since burned away, and its skin had long become ghastly to behold.\n\nBut it still walked out. Its eyes had been closed all along, even though its entire face was already a bloody, pitted mess. But as it stepped out of the firelight, it slowly opened its eyes.\n\nIn its eye sockets,\n\nthere was only emptiness,\n\nbut soon, two green circles of light emerged, glowing with a peculiar luster.\n\nFor some reason, when this fellow walked out, Zhou Ze felt a sense of telepathic connection with it, as if this fellow was another version of himself, without any impurities, very pure.\n\n\"Uh…………\"\n\nIt opened its mouth,\n\nbut no words came out.\n\nThe priest's soul, clenched in Zhou Ze's palm, was extremely agitated at this moment. He had succeeded! His research had unexpectedly succeeded at this very moment, by such a strange coincidence!\n\nHowever,\n\nZhou Ze lifted him up,\n\nand then,\n\nreleased his hand.\n\nThe priest was stunned for a moment,\n\nhe was just set free like this?\n\n\"Uh…………\"\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\nthe corpse suddenly moved. It opened its mouth, revealing black fangs inside, and directly bit down on the priest's soul, then furiously tore at it.\n\nThe priest didn't even have time to let out a scream before his own corpse tore at him in an extremely brutal manner, scattering his soul!\n\nAfter doing all this,\n\nthe corpse raised its head again and looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nthe two of them simply stared at each other;\n\nand then,\n\nthe corpse silently bent at the waist,\n\non one knee,\n\nknelt down.\n\n---\n¹ Otousan (Japanese: お父さん): A Japanese term for \"father.\"\n² The phrase \"柳暗花明\" (liǔ àn huā míng) literally translates to \"willows dark, flowers bright.\" It is an idiom used to describe a situation where, after a difficult or confusing period, things unexpectedly take a turn for the better, often in an idyllic way.\n³ \"雷霆雨露皆是君恩\" (léitíng yǔlù jiē shì jūn'ēn): A classical Chinese saying meaning \"all graces, whether thunder or rain, come from the sovereign.\" It implies that everything an emperor (or superior) does, whether harsh or benevolent, is considered a gift or a favor, and one should accept it without question.\n⁴ \"王侯將相寧有種乎\" (wánghóu jiàngxiàng níng yǒu zhǒng hū): A famous rhetorical question and revolutionary slogan from Chinese history, originating from the Qin dynasty. It means \"Are kings, nobles, generals, and ministers born with a specific lineage/seed?\" or \"Do kings, nobles, generals, and ministers have a specific lineage?\" It questions the inherent right to power based on birth and implies that anyone can rise to such positions.",

    "content": "\"What the heck is this?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist watched an adult, draped in black gauze, step out of the car. He thought, weren't the boss and them out for revenge? It was one thing not to have any casualties, but how did they come back with an extra person?\n\nAnd this person was really strange, completely covered from head to toe, not even revealing their eyes.\n\nIt was impossible to tell if they were male or female.\n\nSo mysterious-looking.\n\nFigure in black?\n\nHmm?\n\nWait,\n\nThey smelled fragrant,\n\nLike Brazilian barbecue.\n\nThe Old Taoist put his nose close to the man and sniffed. So fragrant, deliciously fragrant. He then turned his head to Zhou Ze and asked:\n\n\"Boss, did you go eat barbecue?\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nThe little loli on the side couldn't bear to watch anymore, especially when the Old Taoist, with a look of rapture, put his nose close to *that thing* and sniffed; it was truly disgusting.\n\nShe was really glad she hadn't brought her physical body with her today, otherwise she would have thrown up.\n\n\"I brought them back to help you with chores. From now on, you can have him help you with anything,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist jolted in surprise.\n\nDamn it!\n\nHe had just been mocking that little hussy Bai Yingying for always trying to compete with the little loli for favor, and now his own status was being infringed upon?\n\nSomeone was even trying to snatch *this* job from him—a job that involved cleaning every day, living at the whim of ghosts, receiving no salary whatsoever, and even having to offer sacrifices to ghosts from time to time?\n\nIs there any justice left in the world?!\n\nJob competition is too brutal nowadays!\n\n\"Go help him take a bath, be gentle,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"A bath?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist paused, then asked:\n\n\"She's a woman?\"\n\n\"Yes, she's a woman, so you need to be gentle. She has severe autism.\"\n\nHearing this, the Old Taoist,\n\nHeh heh,\n\nHe subconsciously rubbed his calloused hands.\n\n\"Is this... appropriate?\"\n\n\"I trust your character.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the Old Taoist's shoulder,\n\nIndicating, 'I'm counting on you.'\n\nThen, Zhou Ze said to the masked person, \"Follow him. Do whatever he tells you to do.\"\n\nThe masked person walked over to the Old Taoist, very obediently.\n\nThe Old Taoist was a little shy, but still led her to the bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze and the others also entered the bookstore. Bai Yingying poured Zhou Ze a cup of coffee. Zhou Ze picked up the coffee, took a sip, and then said:\n\n\"Go bolt the bathroom door.\"\n\n\"Alrighty.\"\n\nBai Yingying quickly went and bolted the door.\n\nBefore long,\n\nThe Old Taoist's terrified screams echoed from the bathroom, and then the Old Taoist began to frantically pound on the bathroom door, looking utterly distraught.\n\n\"Boss, let me out, let me out!\"\n\n\"Talk to me after it's clean,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"...Old Taoist.\n\nAbout half an hour later, the Old Taoist emerged, his face alternating between green and white. He didn't eat dinner either, sitting alone at the bar, contemplating life.\n\nThe visual impact was indeed too strong, so strong that it almost caused the Old Taoist a mental breakdown.\n\nThe little loli went back; her soul had been out of her body for too long, and she had to return to dormancy.\n\nXu Qinglang still hadn't returned by dinner, presumably still gloomy and sad, so Zhou Ze had to order takeout again.\n\nBai Yingying, as per Zhou Ze's instructions, went out and bought a few outfits. He wanted clothes that could fully cover the body. Such clothes were difficult to find, so Bai Yingying could only buy a few Spider-Man and Iron Man suits. After putting them on that individual, they looked much more normal.\n\nThis way, she could move around normally and do things in the bookstore from now on, and wouldn't have to worry about scaring others.\n\nAfter dinner, Zhou Ze looked at the Old Taoist, still sitting there in a daze, and felt a pang of sympathy.\n\nHe also felt a little guilty inside.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nZhou Ze walked over and stood in front of the Old Taoist.\n\nThe Old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze blankly.\n\nHe felt so aggrieved,\n\nHe really wanted to cry.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"It's fine. Try to look on the bright side.\"\n\nZhou Ze comforted him.\n\n\"Boss, next time something like this happens, could you give me some psychological preparation beforehand?\"\n\nIt wasn't that the Old Taoist was too naive, but because everyone around ghosts was strange, and it wasn't impossible for a shy girl to ask him to help with a bath and chat about life or something.\n\nBut when he, filled with anticipation and excitement, helped that person take off their clothes,\n\nWhat was revealed was a large expanse of charred skin, oozing pus everywhere...\n\nThe imagination was rich,\n\nBut reality was stark.\nThis huge disparity was enough to make the Old Taoist break down, and the Old Taoist even felt he might contract the same 'ailment' as the boss because of this.\n\nThis was the boss's revenge, definitely revenge. Who told him to constantly chat with the boss about his 'escorting fallen women'*?\n\nThis was simply like talking about how unruly and wasteful one's son was in front of an eunuch—asking for death!\n\n\"Don't worry, it won't happen again next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, Boss.\" The Old Taoist took a deep breath and asked, \"Boss, what *is* that thing?\"\n\nThat thing, it couldn't even be considered human anymore.\n\n\"It's that Japanese priest,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What?\" The Old Taoist was shocked.\n\n\"You can ask Bai Yingying for the specific details. Anyway, she's quite safe now, completely under my control. You can really have her help with cleaning and stuff from now on.\"\n\n\"Alrighty.\" Hearing this, the Old Taoist finally felt a little more at ease.\n\n\"You're getting old, and this kind of work isn't suitable for you to do too much of anymore. You should pay more attention to taking care of yourself.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Boss, this humble Taoist is in excellent health. I can last half an hour at a time, making them feel that earning my money is truly difficult and a real torment.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked in from outside. He walked to the bar counter, poured a glass of red wine, and drank it in one gulp.\n\nClearly, he was quite dejected.\n\nZhou Ze patted the Old Taoist's shoulder again and said, \"Don't worry, next time I ask you to do something, I'll definitely let you know beforehand.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Boss.\"\n\n\"From now on, she'll be sharing a room with you and sleeping with you. Just giving you a heads-up about that.\"\n\n\"...Old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Xu Qinglang and said, \"What's wrong? Still so dejected?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, not dwelling on it too much.\" Xu Qinglang licked his lips, then poured another glass of red wine and continued drinking.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know how to comfort him. He figured Xu Qinglang would get over it himself in a while.\n\n\"Old Zhou, tell me, are there really gods in this world?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"There should be, right? After all, I'm a Ghost Messenger.\"\n\nIf there's one, there can be two; if there are two, there can be three; and if there are three, there can be all things.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, \"So, there are sea gods too?\"\n\n\"If you think so, then there probably are.\"\n\n\"That sea god is truly no good.\"\n\n\"Maybe he's not even human. He could just be a giant sea turtle who cultivated into a spirit, who knows.\"\n\nAt the bookstore entrance, a group of students walked in. The one leading them was a girl, around seventeen or eighteen years old, likely a high school student.\n\n\"Boss, there are so many of us, can we get a discount?\"\n\n\"What discount? I'm paying for it,\" a chubby male student said.\n\nThen, these students sat together, and began copying from each other's homework notebooks.\n\nEveryone copied very seriously and solemnly, as if they were truly doing their own work.\n\n\"It's like we're back in the old days,\" Xu Qinglang said, holding his wine glass in one hand and pointing towards the students with the other.\n\n\"I never copied. Others copied from me,\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"I know, you're a straight-A student, a top scholar.\" Xu Qinglang poured Zhou Ze a glass of wine too.\n\n\"Everyone get a milk tea,\" the chubby boy called out, waving his hand.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded and went back to the kitchen to start making milk tea.\n\nAfter a while, the chubby boy walked over himself and asked, \"Is the milk tea ready?\"\n\n\"I'll bring them over to you when they're ready,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"Never mind, I'll wait. I've finished copying anyway.\"\n\nThe chubby boy was playing on his phone nearby, then pulled out a cigarette and lit it, with his back to his classmates in the distance.\n\nBefore long, Xu Qinglang had prepared all the milk teas and sealed each cup.\n\nThe chubby boy took one milk tea, then inserted a straw, and then took a few more milk teas and walked over to his classmates.\n\nBai Yingying carried the remaining milk teas over on a tray.\n\nA moment later, Zhou Ze actively stood up and walked over to the students, looking left and right, which made the students who were copying their homework feel very uncomfortable; after all, copying homework wasn't exactly something to be proud of.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze also noticed an exception: a girl dressed a bit more simply but with a very delicate appearance wasn't copying; she was doing her own work.\n\nThen she would share the completed parts with her classmates around her so they could continue copying.\n\nThis was a very natural thing to happen. Among a group of 'study duds,'** there was bound to be one 'academic ace'*** acting as the backbone.\n\n\"The ice is melting, drink it quickly,\" the chubby boy said to the academic ace girl, and at the same time, he pushed the milk tea closer to her.\n\nThe girl shook her head, indicating she wasn't thirsty, and also said, \"Don't come here next time, it's too expensive.\"\n\n\"It's not expensive, not expensive at all, I have plenty of pocket money,\" the chubby boy said, showing off. \"Have some, the milk tea here tastes really good and is made with great care. I came here last time, and it's also very expensive.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze suddenly really wanted to tell the chubby student that all the milk teas and drinks sold at his bookstore were Xiangpiaopiao**** brand, made by Xu Qinglang using instant sachets in the back kitchen. Old Xu had become increasingly lazy ever since he realized he needed to start taking care of himself.\n\nThe girl hesitated, put down her pen, and reached for the milk tea.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze walked past, and his arm accidentally brushed against it, causing the milk tea to fall to the ground and spill.\n\n\"Oh, my apologies, I'll get you a new one.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked up the milk tea from the floor.\n\nThe chubby boy looked up, glaring at Zhou Ze, \"What the hell are you loitering around here for!\"\n\n\"Alright, don't be angry, it's just a cup of milk tea,\" a classmate beside him advised.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the chubby student, and instead, walked back to the bar counter with the milk tea, saying to Xu Qinglang:\n\n\"Mix another sachet.\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n\nZhou Ze walked out, stood at the bookstore entrance, and smoked a cigarette.\n\nJust then, Bai Yingying was sitting behind the counter playing a battle royale game. Seeing the milk tea Zhou Ze had brought back sitting on the counter, she simply picked it up and drank it herself, since it had only fallen on the floor, no one had drunk from it, and it wasn't dirty anyway.\n\nShe didn't need to eat, but sometimes needed to replenish fluids.\n\nAnother half an hour passed.\n\nAmong that group of students, those who had finished copying their homework began to leave one by one.\n\nFinally, only the chubby student and the academic ace girl remained. The chubby student eagerly said:\n\n\"I'll call a taxi to take you home, okay?\"\n\n\"No need, I'll take the bus home.\"\n\nThe academic ace girl packed her backpack and walked out of the bookstore.\n\nThe chubby student sighed, stood up, and went to the counter to pay first.\n\n\"Nine hundred in total.\" Xu Qinglang calculated based on the number of people, with a minimum consumption of one hundred per person.\n\n\"Alipay.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe chubby student paid, and as he turned to leave, he saw Zhou Ze walking in from outside.\n\nHe snorted through his nose; the chubby student was clearly very displeased with Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze smiled at him,\n\nAnd then, as the chubby student walked past Zhou Ze,\n\n\"Whack!\"\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nZhou Ze slapped the chubby student directly across the face.\n\nA shadowy figure was slapped out of his body. The chubby student spun in a circle where he stood, feeling dizzy and dazed, seemingly unaware that he had just been slapped.\n\nHe looked at Zhou Ze blankly and said, \"What happened to me?\"\n\n\"You walked into the door. Go on home.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, Boss.\"\n\nThe chubby student nodded and smiled at Zhou Ze, then walked out of the bookstore.\n\nInside the bookstore, however,\n\nA short man was left behind,\n\nKneeling there, trembling.\n\n\"That hairstyle is quite something,\" Xu Qinglang said, leaning on the counter.\n\nYes, the short man's hairstyle was indeed quite something,\n\nOthers' Mohawks were already unconventional enough,\n\nBut his was even more exaggerated:\n\nStuck in his head,\n\nWas a knife.\n\n------\nWe're about to drop out of the top ten. Do any of you dear ones still have monthly votes? Please cast them for Dragon!\n\nDon't panic,\n\nHug Dragon tightly!\n\n---\n* \"Escorting fallen women\": A euphemism for patronizing prostitutes.\n** \"Study duds\": Slang for students who are poor at academics.\n*** \"Academic ace\": Slang for a top student or high-achiever.\n**** Xiangpiaopiao: A popular Chinese brand of instant milk tea.",

    "content": "A knife hangs over the head of lust, and it was already obvious what kind of ghost this fellow was.\n\nIn reality, whether in ancient times or modern, people often view the word \"promiscuity\" with great tolerance;\n\nIn ancient times, a scholar's promiscuity, his lingering in flower streets and willow lanes, was considered an extremely elegant affair; even in modern times, regarding those Pao Wangs¹ who boast of their conquests, you might not agree with their lifestyle, but you wouldn't feel it's a heinous crime.\n\nAfter all, all of this is built on the foundation of mutual consent.\n\nIt could be \"flowery words and clever talk,\" it could be \"lonely companionship,\" or it could be \"money and goods cleared\"; people are quite open-minded in this regard.\n\nBut those lecherous ghosts who like to use coercion and despicable means often suffer society's contempt and scorn. It's said that in prison, the lowest-ranking inmates are often sex offenders.\n\nThe man knelt there, kowtowing repeatedly to Zhou Ze; he hoped Zhou Ze would spare his life.\n\nThe bookstore was, in fact, Zhou Ze's execution ground, especially after Zhou Ze was officially instated; it was also considered a special place. The various ghosts and specters outside would involuntarily want to approach this bookstore, either by unknowingly pushing open the door and walking in, or by possessing other places or connecting with the bookstore in other ways.\n\nBoss Zhou fishes, and the willing take the bait.\n\nActually, at first, Zhou Ze hadn't seen a ghost lurking on the chubby classmate, and yes, Xu Qinglang hadn't seen it either.\n\nZhou Ze only noticed the chubby classmate secretly putting something into a cup of milk tea; as for what kind of medicine it was, everyone knew perfectly well – it certainly wasn't cold medicine.\n\nBased on the fact that this was his own shop, and according to legal regulations, he had to protect the personal safety of customers who consumed goods in his store, so Boss Zhou had no choice but to intervene.\n\n\"Hey, you saw it early, didn't you?\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Ah, mm.\"\n\nZhou Ze silently nodded.\n\nThere was no need to explain this; let the people around you think you're awesome and amazing. Let this beautiful misunderstanding continue.\n\n\"Haha, your slap to that guy directly knocked a ghost out; honestly, it looked quite unexpected, a bit like the style of a Heavenly Master from Mount Longhu.\"\n\nOld Xu was still boasting about him, and Zhou Ze remained silent, enduring these praises.\n\nHe actually wanted to say that he had only intended to give that guy a slap to teach him a lesson, purely because he found him annoying and wanted to give him a slap, and at most beat him up then burn some paper money afterwards. But unexpectedly, he discovered that the lecherous ghost attached to the chubby classmate had actually been slapped out by him.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had also thought about why he and Xu Qinglang hadn't seen this lecherous ghost before. Thinking about it, there could only be one reason: everyone has lust in their hearts.\n\nThey all have that impulse, that restlessness, that desire; this desire is similar to the pursuit of money and power, it's a manifestation of human nature. And because of this, the lecherous ghost could hide itself under that cover.\n\nWhether it existed or not, the chubby classmate actually had lust in his heart, so that was its best camouflage.\n\nZhou Ze opened the gates of Hell, grabbed the small, short lecherous ghost from the ground, and prepared to send it into Hell.\n\n\"Spare me, spare me, spare me...\"\n\nThe lecherous ghost was still begging,\n\nBut besides continuously begging for mercy, it had no other useful words, such as 'spare me and I can give you something,' or 'spare me and I can tell you some important news.'\n\nHm,\n\nUnder these circumstances, Boss Zhou was still very righteous and impartial,\n\nFinally, the lecherous ghost was thrown into the gates of Hell.\n\nTonight's revenue could be considered an addition.\n\n\"You know, does every lecherous ghost have a knife over its head?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Do you still remember that teacher we encountered before who wore a tall hat?\" Zhou Ze countered.\n\n\"Mm, but he was wronged; this one probably doesn't count.\"\n\nThat teacher wearing the tall hat was clearly wronged, but under the power of public opinion², even Zhou Ze's fingernails couldn't remove the tall hat from his head.\n\nPerhaps Hell seemed to have this tradition, or maybe it was because Hell was truly too vast, and the people in the Underworld were rather lazy and negligent in governance, so they liked to use a one-size-fits-all³ approach. Most of them continued the 'verdicts' from the mortal realm.\n\nThose who wore hats wore hats, those who were branded were branded; whatever conclusion was reached in the mortal realm, the Underworld inherited it, greatly reducing the workload of the Underworld. As for whether anyone was wronged within it, sorry, no one cared.\n\nWith a business deal done for the day, Boss Zhou couldn't be bothered to stay up until dawn anymore. He went to the bathroom, took a shower first, then put on his bathrobe and went upstairs.\n\nWatching Zhou Ze's back as he went up the stairs, Xu Qinglang took another sip of red wine, his gaze falling on the suspicious milk tea cup Zhou Ze had brought over earlier. The milk tea was already empty.\n\nXu Qinglang stretched; of course, Xu Qinglang knew who had drunk it, and the person who drank it seemed to have sensed something was off, and had secretly gone upstairs earlier.\n\nHeh heh.\n\nOld Xu's gaze wandered, waiting for the show.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze sensed a slight chill.\n\nHe wasn't afraid of the cold, but the starkly different temperature inside the bedroom compared to outside still caught Zhou Ze's attention.\n\nHe looked up at the air conditioner; it wasn't on, so why was it so cold?\n\nOn the bed, Bai Yingying lay there, covered by a blanket, still squirming incessantly.\n\nZhou Ze was slightly displeased; he had told her countless times not to get into bed before showering. This was a disrespect to the bed, and of course, most importantly, because Boss Zhou was a germaphobe.\n\nNo matter how pretty or beautiful you are, if you dare to get into my bed without showering, sorry, I'll kick you off.\n\n\"Cough cough...\"\n\nHe coughed once, standing by the bed.\n\nIn the past, Bai Yingying would probably have been scared enough to quickly stand up, admit her mistake, and promise she'd never dare again.\n\nBut this time, Bai Yingying actually remained lying on the bed, unmoving.\n\nNo, she did move,\n\nBut it was just her using her legs to turn over, clamping the blanket between her legs, and a soft 'Ying ying ying'⁴ sound came from under the blanket.\n\nYing ying ying... Ying ying ying...\n\nAt times lingering, at times melodious, at times passionate, at times low-pitched.\n\nHe pulled back the blanket,\n\nBai Yingying turned onto her side and looked at Zhou Ze; she had seductive eyes like silk, disheveled hair, a flushed face, red lips, and pearly teeth – truly a pitiful sight that stirred desire.\n\nMaking one wish to immediately gallop on horseback, galloping until a horse hide becomes one's shroud⁵.\n\n\"Did you wet the bed?\"\n\nAtmosphere killer,\n\nSmall-freshness⁶ destroyer,\n\nThe man who should be sent to the stake — Ze,\n\nwas once again explaining the reason why he was still a 'single dog' at thirty in his previous life.\n\nBai Yingying bit her finger, slowly coiling her body, then she sat up, placed her hands on Zhou Ze's shoulders, and said coquettishly:\n\n\"Boss... I want... Ying ying ying...\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nHis smile was somewhat helpless,\n\nHe first lowered his head to look at the blanket he had just pulled off and thrown to the ground, which was now stiff enough to be used as a cutting board,\n\nthen looked between Bai Yingying's legs,\n\nYou want it,\n\nbut I dare not give it.\n\nI have an ordinary human body; if I really gave it to you, tomorrow I'd have to run to Dr. Lin for an amputation due to frostbite.\n\n\"That cup of milk tea, you drank it?\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of something and asked.\n\n\"Milk tea... What milk tea... Ying ying ying... I want it, Boss... Ying ying ying...\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nBai Yingying leaped forward,\n\nHer physical quality was not something Zhou Ze, without activating his 'Musou'⁷, could resist. Zhou Ze was directly tackled to the ground by her.\n\nA dull thud echoed from the floor.\n\nDownstairs, Xu Qinglang, who was drinking red wine, spit out the wine in his mouth with a 'pfft' sound, looked up, and was a bit surprised: So fierce?\n\nOld Daoist, who was playing cards with Monkey, also looked up, glancing at the ceiling above with some confusion.\n\nHoly shit,\n\nThe Boss unleashed his might?\n\nOld Xu and Old Daoist both felt hurt at this moment,\n\nIt was a deep sorrow and bitterness, having been outmatched in an aspect where a man could least afford to lose.\n\n...\n\nAfter a long while, Zhou Ze retracted his fingernails,\n\nBai Yingying, lying on the ground, almost completely exhausted, her eyes finally regained clarity; as if she had vented completely, she looked at Zhou Ze with some bewilderment:\n\n\"Boss, what just happened?\"\n\n\"You said your back was a bit itchy, so I helped you scratch it.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Boss.\"\n\n\"Go take a shower,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying leaned on the wall and slowly walked downstairs, swaying as she walked, finding it very difficult.\n\nShe saw Xu Qinglang and Old Daoist looking at her with sympathetic gazes.\n\nFrom then on, for a long time, neither Xu Qinglang nor Old Daoist ever brought up the matter of 'being hard'⁸ in front of Zhou Ze again.\n\nAccording to Old Daoist's words,\n\nCan't brag about it, really can't brag about it. He finds pitiful 'fallen women'⁹, but the Boss KO'd a zombie.\n\nHow can you even compare?\n\n---\n¹ **Pao Wang**: Slang for a notorious womanizer or playboy, literally \"cannon king.\"\n² **Power of public opinion**: A literal translation of \"眾口鑠金\" (zhòng kǒu shuò jīn) is \"many mouths melt gold,\" an idiom meaning that rumors or public opinion, even if false, can become widely accepted as truth and have immense power.\n³ **One-size-fits-all**: A literal translation of \"一刀切\" (yī dāo qiē) is \"cut with one knife,\" referring to a simplistic, undiscriminating, or blanket approach.\n⁴ **Ying ying ying**: A Chinese onomatopoeia often used to describe a soft, whiny, or coquettish sound, sometimes implying a flirtatious or vulnerable demeanor.\n⁵ **A horse hide becomes one's shroud**: A classical idiom, \"馬革裹屍還\" (mǎ gé guǒ shī huán), meaning to die bravely in battle and have one's body wrapped in a horse's hide as a shroud. Here, it is used hyperbolically to emphasize intense sexual desire leading to extreme exhaustion.\n⁶ **Small-freshness**: A direct translation of \"小清新\" (xiǎo qīng xīn), referring to a style or aesthetic that is light, pure, fresh, often associated with a romantic or gentle atmosphere. Here, it refers to the destruction of such a mood.\n⁷ **Activating his 'Musou'**: In video games, particularly hack-and-slash games like Dynasty Warriors, \"Musou\" (無雙, Wúshuāng) refers to a special, powerful attack or state where a character becomes exceptionally strong or invulnerable, allowing them to defeat many enemies quickly.\n⁸ **Being hard**: A literal translation of \"石更\" (shígēng), a deliberate mischaracterization of the Chinese character \"硬\" (yìng), meaning \"hard.\" It is used as slang for an erection, employing a homophonic or visually similar pun.\n⁹ **Fallen women**: A euphemism for prostitutes.",

    "content": "The next morning, Zhou Ze, as usual, sat on the sofa by the bookstore's glass window, reading the *Yangzi Evening News*.\n\nIn front of him were a cup of coffee and a small cake.\n\nBoss Zhou’s life was just this leisurely, just this good-for-nothing, just this lacking in ambition; he was just muddling through, just taking things as they came.\n\nBack then, Xu Qinglang had criticized Zhou Ze, saying that muddling through like this had no future, that he was too much of a \"salted fish\"¹, practically wasting his rebirth.\n\nAnd most importantly, wasting his \"golden fingernail\".\n\nThen...\n\nThen Xu Qinglang failed to change Boss Zhou’s continued decadence; instead, he himself was assimilated by Boss Zhou.\n\nOriginally, even with over twenty apartments, he was a \"demolition second-generation\"² who still ran his own noodle shop business, never losing his life's ambitions.\n\nBut he was slowly \"bent\" by Boss Zhou, and also became a \"salted fish\" who started skincare, beauty, and knew how to take care of himself.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze felt his current life was quite good. The bookstore had many novels, and many \"rebirth\" novels, where protagonists returned from rebirth looking full of bitterness and deep hatred, or striving for royal empires, or dominating the world with laughter.\n\nOld Dao, having nothing to do, also flipped through these books, then always said that the boss was different from the people in the books.\n\nHowever, Old Dao himself could let it go; books, after all, were fake. And if the protagonists in the books really just sunbathed and muddled through every day like his own boss, who would read that?\n\nReaders would just come to watch you sunbathe, sunbathe, then sunbathe again, and keep sunbathing?\n\nThe priest, dressed in a Spider-Man suit, was cleaning. He cleaned meticulously, not missing a single detail, and always executed Zhou Ze’s instructions without the slightest discount.\n\nBai Yingying was somewhat relieved, fortunate that this \"colleague\" was a man, otherwise she would have to face competition again.\n\nAfter Old Dao got over his initial bewilderment, he also got used to the priest's presence. Although at first, when they slept in the same room at night, he would always smell roasted meat, he slowly grew accustomed to it.\n\nNow, Old Dao could finally find some free time, imitate his boss by finding a sofa to lie on, sipping a little tea, reading a \"little yellow book,\" and leisurely enjoying life.\n\nBusiness during the day had always been very slow.\n\nThere weren't many customers.\n\nThus, the bookstore owner was sunbathing and reading the newspaper, Old Dao was drinking tea and reading a \"little yellow book,\" Xu Qinglang was mixing his new cocktail, Bai Yingying was playing *King's Glory* on her phone, and the little monkey was secretly eating Old Dao’s peanuts, and once full, lay there sleeping.\n\nThe whole house, from top to bottom, exuded the scent of \"salted fish\" everywhere, completely out of place with the bustling atmosphere of the *Nandajie Commercial Street* outside.\n\nIt wasn't until noon that a customer finally came in.\n\nXu Qinglang looked up and saw a young man enter. The man was quite tall, looked frail, but had a lot of stubble on his face, clearly having neglected his appearance due to something recently.\n\nSomeone disturbing him made Xu Qinglang very displeased. He looked back at the sign that read 'Minimum per person consumption: 100 [yuan]', thinking whether his place was still not \"black enough\"³?\n\nNext time, how about changing it to 'one thousand'?\n\nOtherwise, there would always be these people who think they have a bit of money and want to experience a petty bourgeois atmosphere coming in to disturb him.\n\nIt was clearly a business for ghosts; why did living people always come to join the fun?\n\nOne hundred yuan just to sit here, read a book, and drink some instant coffee or milk tea, is that stupid⁴?\n\nThe man pointed to the glass in front of Xu Qinglang and said:\n\n\"Cocktail.\"\n\nThen the man sat down in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. Although he felt very uncomfortable being disturbed, he was, after all, from the catering industry, so he wouldn't do anything to the customer.\n\nImmediately, a cocktail was quickly mixed and delivered to the man.\n\nThe man took a sip, quite satisfied, then leaned on the bar, resting his head, and just watched Xu Qinglang.\n\nAt first, Xu Qinglang didn't feel anything, but the other party just kept leaning there, taking a sip of his drink, then continuing to watch him, taking another sip, continuing to watch him.\n\nXu Qinglang had a feeling he was being treated as a drinking snack.\n\nWhile 'beauty to feast upon' used for a woman is mostly a compliment, Old Xu had always felt he was a man—oh no, he *was* a man, not just felt like one.\n\nThis made Old Xu uncomfortable. He said with some displeasure, \"Do you want more alcohol?\"\n\n\"You're really good-looking.\"\n\nThe man suddenly chuckled.\n\nWith a lecherous look.\n\nXu Qinglang let out a long breath, licked his lips. He was going to hit someone.\n\n\"Hey, you're so pretty, a lot of men must like you, right?\"\n\nThe other party asked again.\n\nXu Qinglang rolled up his sleeves, ready to hit someone.\n\n\"There must be, right? Heh heh, you want to hit me? Do you feel I've insulted you?\"\n\nThe man looked up at Xu Qinglang, then pointed to his own face, \"Go ahead and hit me, hit me right here.\"\n\nHe was so despicable.\n\nXu Qinglang, on the contrary, felt a bit embarrassed to hit him, but still said in a deep voice:\n\n\"I'm very normal in that regard.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe man responded, sounding a bit disappointed, then picked up his glass and took another sip.\n\n\"So, did someone take a fancy to you?\"\n\nBoss Zhou, having finished his sunbathing, walked over at this moment.\n\nAt this moment, the man seemed drunk, or perhaps he was already carrying anger, and immediately smashed the glass in his hand onto the floor.\n\nWith a crisp 'crack', the glass shattered all over the floor.\n\nThe \"Spider-Man\" who was cleaning stopped his movements. He walked over, looked at the customer, then looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nMeaning: should this person be killed?\n\nA murderous aura already emanated from Spider-Man.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nSpider-Man immediately retreated and continued cleaning elsewhere.\n\n\"My apologies, I'll pay for it.\"\n\nThe man took out his wallet.\n\n\"Heartbroken?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe man shook his head. \"Unemployed.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nThe man looked at Xu Qinglang, first handed him the money, then said, \"Could I have another drink?\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, made him another drink, then deliberately pointed to the glass and said, \"This glass is a piece of art, bought for two thousand yuan.\"\n\nThe implied meaning was: if you break the glass again, you'll pay two thousand.\n\nThe man froze for a moment, gave an embarrassed laugh, then took a sip.\n\nZhou Ze sat down beside him and said to the man:\n\n\"If you don't mind, you can tell us your unhappy story to make us happy.\"\n\n\"............\" The man.\n\nThe man gave a bitter laugh and said:\n\n\"I used to be the Deputy Director of the Logistics Department at *Tongcheng University*.\"\n\n\"You became a director so young!\" Old Dao also chimed in at this moment. \"Your family must have really strong connections, right?\"\n\n\"............\" The man.\n\n\"Ignore them, keep going.\" Xu Qinglang urged. \"We haven't gotten to the tragic part yet.\"\n\n\"............\" The man.\n\nThe man nodded and said, \"Because there were incidents of stray dogs biting people on campus, I was held accountable and dismissed from my position. My previous job was to be responsible for campus safety.\"\n\n\"Then you deserved it; you were negligent in your work,\" Old Dao analyzed from the side.\n\n\"The problem is, last year I planned to take the security guards to round up all the stray dogs on campus. We did, but then we were stopped.\"\n\nThe man took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\n\"Stopped by your superiors?\"\n\n\"Stopped by students,\" the man replied.\n\n\"Uh... why did they stop you?\"\n\n\"They said what we were doing was too cruel, lacked love. Because at the time, we had contacted the local stray animal shelter, but they were also under a lot of pressure and couldn't take in so many stray animals. Our plan was to send away as many as we could; those that couldn't be sent away or housed, we would directly kill.\"\n\n\"Directly kill them? Tsk tsk, how cruel,\" Old Dao clicked his tongue. \"But then again, it's true, you can't let students be in danger on campus, otherwise, it would be a huge problem.\"\n\n\"Later, I remember a student wrote an article online exposing what we were doing, and it was even reposted by the media, with the title:\n\n'*Can a University That Cannot Even Accommodate a Single Stray Dog Accommodate a Person*?'\"\n\n\"Tsk tsk, that's a good 'hat' to put on them⁵,\" Old Dao commented.\n\n\"At that time, it was because students hung banners to protest and obstructed our actions, so that matter eventually died down and couldn't proceed.\"\n\nThe man wiped his mouth, then moved the glass to the side before daring to forcefully smack the table, venting his displeasure:\n\n\"The most despicable thing is, last week, two female students were attacked by a pack of stray dogs on campus at night; both were bitten and sent to the hospital!\n\nThen the school pursued accountability, and it became *my* responsibility; they directly fired me!\"\n\nThe man again smacked the table hard.\n\n\"I'm not convinced, truly unconvinced! When I was preparing to take the security guards to solve this problem, not only did students on campus curse me, but a large group of people online also cursed me. For this, I even received criticism and disciplinary action.\n\nNow the stray dogs have bitten people, and I'm still the one held responsible; it's become my dereliction of duty again.\"\n\nHearing this, Old Dao reached out and patted the man's shoulder.\n\n\"This guy really is unlucky.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to be done about it; after all, protecting small animals is currently 'political correctness'.\"\n\nXu Qinglang prepared a fruit platter and pushed it in front of the man, considering it a form of comfort.\n\nThe man grumbled boisterously for a while longer, then dejectedly walked out of the bookstore. Whether he continued to get drunk at a small restaurant or went home to sleep was unknown.\n\nOld Dao turned his head and said to Xu Qinglang, \"Old Xu, what was that 'correctness' you just mentioned?\"\n\n\"Political correctness.\"\n\n\"Oh, right, that thing. I really hate that term now. My live stream room was suspended several times before, all for that reason, saying I was satirizing some group or something, it was baffling. I can't even speak properly anymore; if I'm not careful, I'll offend someone. Why are those people so 'glass-hearted'⁶?\"\n\nOld Dao ran a live stream; although he was old, he was also very trendy.\n\n\"Political correctness is necessary,\" Zhou Ze began. \"It's just that it's becoming more and more distorted now, being abused.\n\nWhen society's emotional protection of certain groups surpasses the pursuit of truth, it means there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's exactly the feeling. Boss, what you said is so incisive and brilliant! No, Old Dao needs to find paper and pen to write this down, and ponder and contemplate it thoroughly.\"\n\nOld Dao knew his job responsibilities: cleaning was secondary; at times of need, offering the boss '66666'⁷ was his actual duty.\n\n\"Alright, let's not talk about this anymore. What are we eating for lunch?\" Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Scrambled eggs with chives, stir-fried black fungus with chives, stir-fried pork slices with chives, stir-fried beef pizzle with chives, chive and egg drop soup............\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"To replenish you. You must have been exhausted last night.\" Xu Qinglang gave a look of concern.\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAh, he hesitated for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze glanced over and saw that Bai Yingying was still engrossed in playing *King's Glory*, so he subtly nodded.\n\n————————\n\nAsking for monthly votes, to help the bookstore return to the top ten on the overall list.\n\nDragon rolling for monthly votes,\n\nRolling over............\n\n............Rolling back............\n\nIn short,\n\nFire monthly votes at the dragon!\n\n---\n¹ **Salted fish (咸鱼, xiányú)**: A common internet slang term for someone who lacks ambition, is lazy, and has no desire for progress, often content with their current, unremarkable life.\n² **Demolition second-generation (拆二代, chāi'èrdài)**: A term for individuals who became wealthy overnight because their family's property was demolished for urban development, resulting in them receiving multiple apartments or large sums of money as compensation.\n³ **Black enough (黑, hēi)**: Here, \"black\" is used colloquially to mean shady, unscrupulous, or exorbitantly priced, implying a business that rips people off or discourages casual customers with high prices.\n⁴ **Is that stupid? (484傻)**: An internet slang term that phonetically resembles \"是不是傻 (shì bu shì shǎ)\", meaning \"Are you stupid?\" or \"Is that stupid?\".\n⁵ **That's a good 'hat' to put on them (帽子盖得好, màozi gàide hǎo)**: A Chinese idiom meaning to effectively label or frame someone/something, often in a negative or critical light, to control public perception or blame.\n⁶ **Glass-hearted (玻璃心, bōlíxīn)**: Internet slang for someone who is very sensitive, easily hurt, or offended.\n⁷ **66666**: An internet slang term, phonetically resembling \"liù liù liù liù liù\", which sounds similar to \"awesome\" or \"lit\" in English. It's used to praise someone's skill, insight, or something impressive.",

    "content": "For lunch, Zhou Ze ate little, adopting a haughtily modest posture that suggested he needed no extra nourishment at all; he ate sparingly, washing it down with plum juice.\n\nThe Old Taoist, on the other hand, ate a prodigious amount, devouring it like an old general still capable of eating his fill. More than half the dishes on the table ended up in his belly.\n\nBy afternoon, the Old Taoist kept glancing out of the bookstore, his mind clearly restless and ready to go out and spread some 'love'. After all, Spider-Man could handle the bookstore's cleaning duties now, so his work was indeed much easier.\n\nHowever, at three in the afternoon, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\nThe caller ID showed an unknown number. Zhou Ze answered, and a very hoarse voice came from the other end:\n\n“Save me... save me...”\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head slightly, holding the phone a little further from himself.\n\nBecause the static on the other end was truly heavy, like a string of small firecrackers going off.\n\n“Hello?” Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n“I’m on Mount Jiangjun, save me... save me...”\n\n“Click!”\n\nZhou Ze promptly hung up the phone, tossed his mobile onto the coffee table, then picked up his coffee again and took a sip.\n\nBeside him, Xu Qinglang looked up at Zhou Ze and asked casually, “Whose call was that?”\n\n“A prank, a distress call.”\n\n“What if it’s real?” Xu Qinglang asked with a smile.\n\n“Said they were on Mount Jiangjun, but it’s too far. Too lazy to go.”\n\nBoss Zhou was a man who hated trouble. Why run around everywhere when he could just sit in the bookstore and wait for business to come to him?\n\nZhou Ze couldn't even be bothered to ponder the true reason for the distress call, nor did he have the time to discern if it was real or fake. He wasn't God, nor was he one of the Powerpuff Girls, to go wherever he was needed.\n\n“Boss, this humble Taoist wants to go out and buy some daily necessities.”\n\nThe Old Taoist walked over to Zhou Ze at this point to ask for leave.\n\nZhou Ze was just about to nod his assent when his phone rang again. It was still the same unknown number.\n\nZhou Ze simply put it on speakerphone:\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Save me... save me... I’m on Mount Jiangjun... They’re going to kill... they’re going to kill... Mount Jiangjun... Mount Jiangjun...”\n\nThe voice was much clearer than last time, but there was still a lot of static.\n\n“Save me... save me... I’m on Mount Jiangjun... They’re going to kill... they’re about to kill... child... woman... They are executioners... executioners...”\n\nXu Qinglang and the Old Taoist exchanged glances. If it was a prank, it was certainly plausible. However, no one usually paid attention to Zhou Ze’s private number, and besides them, no one contacted him. Who would be bored enough to set up a prank specifically for him?\n\nThen... what if it was real?\n\nBut then, how would you explain why someone randomly dialing would necessarily call Zhou Ze’s number? Wouldn’t they just dial 110 for help themselves?\n\nSo currently, neither possibility made much sense.\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone again, then reached up and rubbed his temples.\n\n“What are we eating tonight?” Boss Zhou asked.\n\nEvidently, Boss Zhou’s trouble-averse nature was still putting up a fight, trying his best to avoid this strange distress call. Whether it was real or fake, he simply didn’t want to go out, alright?\n\n“Pasta, perhaps,” Xu Qinglang said.\n\n“Oh, right, Old Taoist, you just said you wanted to go out. Go ahead, just remember to come back early.”\n\n“Alrighty then!”\n\nThe Old Taoist happily strode out, full of vigor, like an old man suddenly overcome with youthful exuberance!\n\n“Yingying, help me buy an unregistered phone card,” Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\n“Understood, Boss.”\n\nBai Yingying left the store and returned shortly. Although the domestic real-name registration for phone cards was strictly enforced, these unregistered cards, likely registered under a stranger’s ID, could still be bought everywhere.\n\nAfter swapping the card, Zhou Ze dialed 110. The operator quickly connected the emergency hotline.\n\n“Hello, this is the Tongcheng police service hotline...”\n\n“I want to report a crime. Someone said there’s a murder case on Mount Jiangjun. You’d best go check it out. I don’t know if it’s true or false. Alright, that’s all.”\n\n“Please hold on a moment. Did you say Mount Jiangjun?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Would it be convenient for you to provide your contact information and address? We’ll dispatch someone to get in touch with you.”\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone again, then removed that phone card and swapped back to his own.\n\nAfter swapping back his card, Zhou Ze hesitated, saying, “Something feels off.”\n\n“What feels off?” Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n“Can’t quite put my finger on it, but something just feels wrong.”\n\n………………\n\nThere were some clubs on Nandajie, but their prices and class were a bit too high. Although the Old Taoist’s pockets were fairly deep, he preferred to comfort those older, fading 'sisters.' Of course, no matter how much they had faded, they were still roughly his daughter’s age, which was a bit beastly of him.\n\nBut the women in those clubs were his granddaughters’ age; that would be worse than beastly!\n\nHe took a taxi to Gangzha, and the Old Taoist, knowing the area well, found a foot massage parlor.\n\nThe rolling shutter door was closed, but the Old Taoist knew this didn’t mean they weren’t open for business.\n\nHe smoked a cigarette outside, and after a short wait, the rolling shutter door was pulled open. An old man, slightly younger than the Old Taoist, emerged from inside, exchanging a knowing smile with him.\n\nAh, the camaraderie of 'brothers-in-law'.¹\n\nTen years of cultivation to share a boat, a hundred years to share a pillow, a thousand years to be 'brothers-in-law'.²\n\nThe Old Taoist bent down and went inside.\n\nInside, a heavily made-up woman, around forty years old, said to the Old Taoist:\n\n“Brother, I’ll go take a bath first. Wait for me, alright?”\n\n“Alright, alright.”\n\nThe Old Taoist sat down on the sofa, directly facing the television.\n\nWhile the woman cleaned herself inside, the Old Taoist outside was already in a state of restless anticipation.\n\nBut then,\n\nThe news broadcast on the television immediately made the Old Taoist’s jaw drop.\n\n“Our station’s latest news: new developments have emerged in the family annihilation case that occurred on Mount Jiangjun a week ago. Police have identified a suspect, a young man named Ye Qing.\n\nThe police have now released a wanted notice: Ye Qing, male, 25 years old, formerly employed at the Tongcheng water plant, was a friend of the deceased family and had gone to Mount Jiangjun for a vacation with them on the day of the incident.\n\nAfter the incident, Ye Qing’s whereabouts have remained unknown. Anyone with information is requested to contact the police. A reward is being offered by the police...”\n\nThe Old Taoist stared at the television screen, utterly dumbfounded.\n\nJust then, the woman emerged from her bath. Seeing the Old Taoist staring at the news on TV, she tutted and said:\n\n“That happened last week, a family of three, all murdered. Their heads were cut off and still haven’t been found. Truly tragic. The couple were quite young, and the child was only about five, a little girl.”\n\nThe Old Taoist suddenly stood up,\n\nDrawing on his experience solving cases with his previous boss, he keenly realized that the call his current boss had received just before he left must have been out of the ordinary!\n\n“Sister, I, uh, didn’t bring my medicine today. I’ll be off now.”\n\nWith that, the Old Taoist ran straight out of the foot massage parlor.\n\n………………\n\nWhen the Old Taoist took a taxi back to the bookstore, he found Zhou Ze wasn’t on the ground floor.\n\nSpider-Man sat there, motionless.\n\nXu Qinglang sat behind the counter, with cucumber slices on his face.\n\n“Where’s the Boss?” the Old Taoist asked.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed upwards, saying nothing.\n\nThe Old Taoist immediately ran up the stairs and pushed open the Boss’s bedroom door.\n\nInside the bedroom,\n\nThe Boss was lying on the tatami mat, his head resting on Bai Yingying’s leg while she massaged his head.\n\nThe Boss looked utterly exhausted, as if he were managing a thousand affairs a day and working incredibly hard,\n\nWhile Bai Yingying looked at him with an expression that said, *Oh Boss, you’re truly too tired, too worn out, too overworked, I feel so bad for you.*\n\nBah!\n\nWhat a shameless pair!\n\nThe Old Taoist savored a moment of satisfaction in his mind.\n\nThen, with righteous indignation, he said:\n\n“Boss, something’s happened!”\n\nZhou Ze slightly turned his head, looking at the Old Taoist standing in the doorway, and asked, “What is it?”\n\n“Boss, on Mount Jiangjun, there was a murder case last week. A family of three was killed, and not only has the killer not been found, but even the heads of the three victims are missing.”\n\n“Oh.” Zhou Ze replied.\n\nNo wonder the police took his emergency call so seriously. It all made sense now.\n\n“Boss, that call you got was very likely a message from an insider,” the Old Taoist reminded him.\n\n“Mm.” Zhou Ze responded again.\n\nThen, he continued to immerse himself in Bai Yingying’s perfectly executed massage.\n\n“…………” The Old Taoist.\n\nHe understood. The Boss probably already knew it in his heart, but he was likely just trouble-averse and didn’t want to get involved. The trouble here might not only refer to the hassle of investigating the matter, but also the complications of an Infernal Bailiff meddling in affairs of the living world.\n\nThe latter trouble could be even greater and more sensitive than the former.\n\nThis made the Old Taoist feel a pain in the ass³—the emperor wasn’t worried, but his eunuch was frantic⁴, which was the most stifling feeling.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze’s phone rang again. It was on the bedside table, charging. Zhou Ze frowned, clearly not wanting to answer, so he didn’t ask Bai Yingying to get it for him either.\n\nThe Old Taoist ran straight over, saw it was still the same unknown number, and immediately pressed the answer button.\n\n“Save me... save us... I’m on Mount Jiangjun... They’re here... they’re here... they’re going to kill... kill...”\n\nZhou Ze reached up and picked at his ears,\n\nDidn’t hear, didn’t hear,\n\nI’m deaf,\n\nI’m deaf,\n\nMy ears have gone bad.\n\nBut then,\n\nA little girl’s agonizing, tragic scream suddenly burst from the phone: “Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!”\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes, his face a mix of helplessness and conflict.\n\nThe call disconnected on its own.\n\nThe Old Taoist swallowed hard, pulled out his own phone, and walked over to Zhou Ze. Holding the phone up to the Boss, he said, “Boss, this is a photo of the daughter from the family of three victims.”\n\nA photo of an innocent, radiant five-year-old girl was held before Zhou Ze,\n\nZhou Ze glanced at it then looked away, but the Old Taoist continued to aim the phone screen directly at Zhou Ze’s eyes.\n\nLook at this,\n\nJust look,\n\nCan you bear it?\n\nCan you really?\n\nAre you even human!\n\nOh, no, even a ghost couldn’t bear it, right?\n\n“Boss, investigate it. They haven’t even found this girl’s head yet!” the Old Taoist urged.\n\nZhou Ze remained silent.\n\n“Boss, I think the person making these calls is highly suspicious. It’s as if they’re right there at the scene.”\n\nZhou Ze sighed, gave up the struggle, and quietly stood up.\n\nHe said to Bai Yingying, “Help me find some casual clothes and a pair of sneakers.”\n\n“Understood, Boss.” Bai Yingying immediately got up to find the clothes.\n\nZhou Ze then looked at the Old Taoist and chuckled, “With your level of insight, you’re still trying to analyze and solve cases?”\n\n“Huh?” The Old Taoist looked somewhat bewildered.\n\n“Who am I?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“An Infernal Bailiff⁵, Boss.”\n\n“Then what was that unknown number that called me?”\n\n“It’s...”\n\n“A ghost call.”\n___\n¹ **brothers-in-law (連襟)**: Literally refers to two men who are married to sisters.

    "content": "開車的是許清朗，不是周澤一定要和許清朗在一起，而是因為自己和老道都沒有駕駛證。\n\n\n\n  試想一下，如果自己和老道兩個人開車出去後，半路再遇到交警，再因為無證駕駛被扣下，那樂子就大了。\n\n\n\n  上次老道已經以身試法過一次了，這一次，總得小心一點。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯和蜘蛛俠留在了書店裡看店，周澤沒讓他們跟過來。\n\n\n\n  將軍山位於通城郊區，和臨近的揚州接壤，開車過去還是挺遠的，從書店出發，一路上沒什麼耽擱，大概一個半小時後，才抵達了目的地。\n\n\n\n  長三角平原是沒什麼山的，就算是有，也只是小山，放在四川和放在東北那幾個多山的區域，根本就不值一提。\n\n\n\n  這就像是南方人沒見過雪見到雪很激動一樣，你讓平原地區的人第一次開車進山路，也會激動得很。\n\n\n\n  將軍山也是近些年才得到了開發，上頭開了幾家比較大型和上檔次的溫泉山莊，算是吸引了一些客流，附近一些村民也辦起了小民宿，但還沒到形成規模的時候。\n\n\n\n  許清朗直接把車開入了一家叫「溫雅溫泉度假山莊」的店裡，他在這裡訂了房間，其實，被害的一家三口當時也是住在這裡，不過他們並不是死在裡頭，而是死在下山的山路上。\n\n\n\n  但哪怕是這樣，這件事對這家酒店生意的影響也是極為恐怖的。 \n\n\n\n  最明顯的就是許清朗原本訂的是一千五一天的帶院子室內溫泉池子的小別墅，前台居然直接熱情地免費給他升級成了帶小四合院日租金五千的房間。\n\n\n\n  而且無論是前台還是迎賓，服務態度簡直好得跟見到親爹媽一樣，熱情得不能再熱情。\n\n\n\n  後來，周澤才知道，現在整個酒店，似乎只有自己這一波的客人。\n\n\n\n  先進了房間，許清朗讓服務生給溫泉池子放水，他打算先去泡一泡，之前周澤喊他出來時已經說好了的，他只負責開車，其餘的事情不管，畢竟周澤喊他的時候他還在做美容。\n\n\n\n  老道倒是殷勤，不停地在網上查著案件資料，周澤則是坐在藤椅上，面前的茶几上放著手機。\n\n\n\n  讓周老闆去跟警察一樣四處找線索，找蛛絲馬跡，這不現實，而且這些事情警察比自己更精通，畢竟術業有專攻嘛，周老闆只需要負責接電話就可以了。\n\n\n\n  其實，周澤真的不是很願意多事兒，也不願意沾惹這些麻煩，但電話里傳來的那個女孩兒的慘叫聲，實在是太讓人難受了。\n\n\n\n  再加上，既然這次很大可能是「鬼來電」，既然是有鬼參合的事兒，自己出手去管的話，也就可以名正言順了。\n\n\n\n  只是，之前連打好幾次的電話，等周澤到了將軍山之後，卻反而沒了動靜，安靜得不得了。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗已經進池子開始泡澡了，他還給自己加了玫瑰精油這些東西，躺在裡面不時地撩撥著水花，還把自己的大腿伸展出來輕輕地撫摸，這姿態，真的很像早些年的香港三J片裡的唯美畫面。\n\n\n\n  辣眼睛，\n\n\n\n  真的太辣眼睛了，\n\n\n\n  如果不知道他是男的還好，你還能欣賞欣賞，\n\n\n\n  但你知道他是男的，就覺得很噁心。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，要不我們還是先去案發現場看看？」老道主動道。\n\n\n\n  周澤很想拒絕，但是繼續留在賓館裡看著院子裡的許娘娘作妖似乎是更痛苦的一件事，當下也就點點頭，跟著許清朗說了一聲後，和老道一起出了酒店。\n\n\n\n  屋子裡就剩下自己一個人，許清朗覺得更加的愜意，一般來說，溫泉池子的水有沒有料，就看你在水裡泡一會兒看看手上腳上有沒有起白皮，如果起白皮了就意味著這水跟大澡堂里沒啥區別。\n\n\n\n  老許一個人泡得美滋滋，雙臂撐開，姿態舒展，旁邊放著酒店送的便宜紅酒，至少，那股子的意境兒許清朗是泡出來了。\n\n\n\n  「叮咚…………叮咚…………」\n\n\n\n  門鈴聲響起。\n\n\n\n  許清朗有些不甘願地從池子裡走出來，披上了浴袍，打開門後，許清朗看見一個服務生端著三杯牛奶和一些零食過來。 \n\n\n\n  「先生，這是酒店送您的。」\n\n\n\n  「好，謝謝。」\n\n\n\n  接過了東西，許清朗關上門，把東西隨手放在了茶几上，然後又脫去了浴袍，重新走入了池子裡。\n\n\n\n  泡著泡著，當自己快要睡著時，許清朗忽然聽到了「喀嚓喀嚓」的聲音，像是有老鼠在咬東西一樣。\n\n\n\n  許清朗一開始以為自己幻聽了，可能溫泉泡久了，整個人也有些飄飄然了，但這個聲音卻還在一直繼續著。\n\n\n\n  回過頭，看向屋子客廳那邊，許清朗並沒有看見人或者老鼠。\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  聲音還在繼續，\n\n\n\n  就在客廳里。\n\n\n\n  抿了抿嘴唇，許清朗再度從池子裡走出來，重新披上了浴袍。\n\n\n\n  雖說他也不是什麼普通人，住在這裡也確實沒什麼害怕的，但眼下畢竟周澤不在，如果自己真遇到什麼事兒，還是有一點點麻煩的。\n\n\n\n  當家的不在，就沒了主心骨啊。\n\n\n\n  客廳里檢查了一遍，讓許清朗有些疑惑的是，當自己走入客廳時，之前響起的聲音又消失不見了。\n\n\n\n  許清朗在客廳沙發上坐了下來，然後目光看向了面前的茶几，茶几上有服務生剛送來的零食和牛奶。 \n\n\n\n  但是零食那邊卻缺了一大塊。\n\n\n\n  被老鼠偷了？\n\n\n\n  許清朗默默地拿起手機，他覺得事情有點詭異，雖然那一家子不是死在這家酒店裡的，這家酒店還在正常營業，但又怎麼能證明這家酒店就一定乾淨？\n\n\n\n  只是，萬一真的是老鼠或者其他小動物偷吃的東西，自己這樣給周澤打電話讓他回來，到時候會不會被笑話？\n\n\n\n  許清朗有些猶豫，他在沙發後面尋找，在茶几下面尋找，他希望看見一隻老鼠或者松鼠之類的東西在這裡躲著，這樣子他就放心了。\n\n\n\n  只是，找來找去，還是沒找到小動物的蹤跡。\n\n\n\n  許清朗又走到了外面院子裡，沒下池子，就站在池子旁邊，等著。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  咀嚼的聲音又響起來了，許清朗目光在客廳里逡巡著，終於，他確定了聲音來源位置！\n\n\n\n  當下，\n\n\n\n  許清朗直接沖了過去，掀開了那裡的茶座，還是一無所獲，聲音也直接消失，但在這裡，還有一個小冰箱。\n\n\n\n  在冰箱裡？\n\n\n\n  許清朗伸手，慢慢地攥住了冰箱把手，然後直接把冰箱打開。\n\n\n\n  冰箱裡放著可樂和啤酒，並沒有其他什麼東西。 \n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，許清朗覺得自己還真怕看見什麼東西在裡頭，那個畫面，想想都讓人覺得頭皮發麻。\n\n\n\n  「天地無極，玄心正法！」\n\n\n\n  許清朗掐著手印，然後取出了一枚護心鏡，直接放在了客廳正中央的茶几上，然後默默地坐在沙發上。\n\n\n\n  溫泉也不去了，\n\n\n\n  其他地方也不去了，\n\n\n\n  就一個人坐在這裡發著呆。\n\n\n\n  「滴答…………滴答…………」\n\n\n\n  客廳掛鐘不停地作響，但先前不斷襲擾人的咀嚼聲音就似乎真的因為許清朗坐在這裡，而沒有再出現過。\n\n\n\n  坐了大概半個多小時後，許清朗再次拿起手機，這次他準備給周澤打電話了，問問他們什麼時候回來，畢竟到了晚飯的點了。\n\n\n\n  許清朗是不會說自己被不知道什麼玩意兒給嚇得連溫泉都沒泡舒坦的。\n\n\n\n  但不知道怎麼的，手機顯示沒有信號，電話怎麼打就是打不出去。\n\n\n\n  許清朗從沙發上站了起來，\n\n\n\n  事情到了這一步，如果他還沒能察覺到詭異的氛圍就真的是白混了。\n\n\n\n  「叮咚…………叮咚…………叮咚…………」\n\n\n\n  門鈴聲再度響起。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗一邊環視四周一邊走向了大門那邊，打開門。\n\n\n\n  換了一個女性侍者，對方手裡拿著一件未開封的浴袍，遞了過來。\n\n\n\n  「這是你要的新浴袍。」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗愣了一下，他什麼時候要過新浴袍？\n\n\n\n  「是這個房間啊，說你們需要額外一件浴袍。」女服務員又看了一眼門牌號，確認了一下，道：「沒錯，那我先走了，祝您度假愉快。」\n\n\n\n  女服務員走前關了門，\n\n\n\n  許清朗抱著這件沒開封的新浴袍走了回來。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  池子裡的熱水，又在放了起來，無緣無故地自己放了起來。\n\n\n\n  而後，之前被自己關上的冰箱門居然又被打開了。\n\n\n\n  茶几上送來的零食，又少了一些。\n\n\n\n  拿起手機，該死，手機信號還是一格都沒有。\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，許清朗覺得自己快被折磨瘋了，這不是他疑神疑鬼，他沒脆弱到那種地步，這的確是一些詭異且匪夷所思的事情正在他身邊實實在在地發生著。\n\n\n\n  許清朗想要洗把臉，他走到了衛生間，把浴袍放在一邊，然後彎下腰洗臉，等到他準備拿洗面奶時，卻忽然發現自己剛剛放在洗臉池旁邊的那件新浴袍不見了。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗抬起頭，對著鏡子，\n\n\n\n  卻發現在鏡子裡，\n\n\n\n  自己的身邊，\n\n\n\n  站著三個人，\n\n\n\n  一個男人一個女人，還有一個小朋友。\n\n\n\n  他們三個人，都穿著浴袍，\n\n\n\n  渾身上下濕漉漉的，面色蒼白，\n\n\n\n  就這樣比比直直地站在他許清朗的身邊。\n\n\n\n  許清朗下意識地歪了歪頭，想看得更仔細一些，\n\n\n\n  鏡子裡那一家三口也一起跟著許清朗的動作歪頭，\n\n\n\n  「噗通」\n\n\n\n  「噗通」\n\n\n\n  「噗通」\n\n\n\n  三聲悶響，\n\n\n\n  一家三口，\n\n\n\n  三顆頭顱，\n\n\n\n  一起滾落。",

    "content": "此情此景，如果是一般人，要麼被直接嚇暈過去，要麼就開始大喊大叫，歇斯底里；\n\n\n\n  不過好在許清朗自己也算是一個玄學人士，雖然只懂得一點點的皮毛，但還不至於被這種所謂的「髒東西」給嚇得雞飛狗跳。\n\n\n\n  他只是有些無奈，人家不過是老老實實地在泡溫泉，結果出門想找你們的周老闆反而沒碰到你們，我在這裡老老實實地待著你們反而找上門了。\n\n\n\n  許清朗默默地穩定住自己的心神，他清楚，一般的鬼魂，他們只能尋找你內心的漏洞來對你發難，只要你能不慌張，就能極大的克制住鬼魂對自己的影響。\n\n\n\n  只是，讓許清朗有些詫異的是，這一家子似乎也沒想著為難他，他們開始蹲在地上，雙手不停地在衛生間的地板上摸索著，像是在找尋著什麼東西。\n\n\n\n  一開始沒想明白，但很快許清朗就想通了，他們是在找——頭！\n\n\n\n  是的，一開始他們是有頭的，但是現在頭沒了，他們在找頭。\n\n\n\n  新聞案情報導上也說了，警方發現了他們的屍體，但他們一家三口的人頭，至今還沒找到。\n\n\n\n  古人講究個全須全尾入土為安，就算是古代的太監們在死去之後也會讓裁縫把自己的寶貝給縫合回去一起下葬，就別說是人頭了。\n\n\n\n  趁著他們在地上摸索的時候，許清朗躡手躡腳地走出了衛生間，又回到了客廳里。 \n\n\n\n  點了一根煙，之前的緊張感反而沒了，或許，未知才是最恐怖的吧，之前那些異動所帶來的緊張感更多的其實還是來自於未知，現在知道是誰在搞鬼之後，心裡反而踏實了不少。\n\n\n\n  又看了一眼手機，發現還是沒信號，沒辦法直接聯繫周澤，許清朗嘆了口氣，乾脆蜷縮著腿，打開了電視機。\n\n\n\n  電視機里正是少兒頻道，正在播放著動畫《熊出沒》。\n\n\n\n  許清朗側著身子看著，他倒是沒直接跑出這個屋子落荒而逃，他清楚周澤找的就是他們，再加上，目前來看，這一家子畢竟是受害者，他們更大的執念是在找自己的頭，也不會有太強的攻擊性和怨念。\n\n\n\n  《熊出沒》放完了，接下來開始放《名偵探柯南》。\n\n\n\n  許清朗皺了皺眉，換了個頻道，這個時候看柯南，總感覺怪怪的。\n\n\n\n  但更巧的是，換了一個地方台後，居然在播報關於這次將軍山滅門事件以及警方對嫌疑人的追查和死者頭顱的追找。\n\n\n\n  這就更滲得慌了，\n\n\n\n  死者一家三口的鬼魂就在這個屋子裡呢，還有比這個更實況的直播？\n\n\n\n  許清朗下意識地又想換台，\n\n\n\n  但他忽然發現那一家三口居然爬到了電視機前停住了，像是也在看新聞一樣。 \n\n\n\n  猶豫了一下，還是不切台了。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  等到周澤和老道回來的時候，許清朗已經躺在客廳沙發上睡著了。\n\n\n\n  「喲，這姿態夠妖嬈的啊。」\n\n\n\n  老道走上前，想拍一下許清朗的大腿把他喊醒，但想想還是算了，他怕自己把自己玩兒彎了，老道很注重自己的名節，已經保持了七十年的「知難而上」，可不想最後拐入歧途。\n\n\n\n  「喂，醒醒了。」周澤喊道。\n\n\n\n  但喊了沒反應，周澤有些意外，睡得這麼沉？\n\n\n\n  當下，周澤靠近了許清朗兩步，發現許清朗的眉心位置，有一團淡淡的黑霧籠罩著，這是被祟上了？\n\n\n\n  伸出指甲，周澤用自己食指指甲在許清朗眉心點了一下，許清朗眉心處被刺破，流出了幾滴黑色的鮮血，然後他慢慢地睜開眼，伸了一個懶腰。\n\n\n\n  「這屋子有問題麼？」周澤環視四周說道。\n\n\n\n  許清朗剛剛明顯是被邪煞之氣入體了，但許清朗畢竟不是普通人，這也足以說明在剛才，這個屋子裡有什麼大凶之物停留過。\n\n\n\n  「我看見了那一家子，就在這個屋子裡。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗開口道。\n\n\n\n  「啥？」老道嚇了一跳，趕忙跑到老闆身邊，做出了護駕的準備。 \n\n\n\n  之前說要來查案給這一家三口報仇的是老道，這會兒被嚇到的也是他，他就是屬於葉公好龍的那一類。\n\n\n\n  「那一家三口，在這裡？」周澤有些莫名其妙，「不應該啊，我之前問過前台了，那一家三口住的是另外一套房子，不是我們這一套，而且那一套房子現在也暫停對外出租了，說是準備過陣子等風聲過來請和尚道士來做個道場。」\n\n\n\n  「貨真價實，一家三口，在這屋子裡爬來爬去，找頭呢。」許清朗肯定道，「我剛剛是睡著了？」\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」老道應和道。\n\n\n\n  「那應該是我和他們待在一起時間久了，身體被煞氣侵入了。」許清朗搖了搖腦袋，顯然，他現在還是有些不清醒。\n\n\n\n  中醫方面，有一種說法，就是邪氣入體導致感冒發熱，許清朗現在的狀況差不多，有種重感冒的架勢。\n\n\n\n  「不過那一家三口沒對我怎麼樣，他們是在找自己的頭，兇手找到不找到再說，如果沒有頭的話，他們也下不了地獄。」許清朗猜測道。\n\n\n\n  「但問題是之前我第一次進這個屋子和現在我第二進這個屋子，我都一點異樣的感覺都沒有。」周澤有些疑惑地說道，「如果那一家三口的亡魂真的在這裡逗留著，我不可能看不見，至少，我不可能連一絲一毫都察覺不到。」\n\n\n\n  作為一個鬼差，如果連一個屋子裡有鬼沒鬼都分辨不出來，那真的可以退休了。 \n\n\n\n  「但我確定是看見了他們。」許清朗肯定道，隨即，他想了想，自嘲道：「或許，我是有一些可能連我自己都沒發現的天賦吧。」\n\n\n\n  「這是不可能滴。」\n\n\n\n  老道撇撇嘴，懶得看許清朗臭美，直接道：「老闆，額覺得，老許能看見我們看不見，其實原因很簡單。\n\n\n\n  肯定有什麼事情，老許做了我們沒做，所以觸發條件不同，自然看見的東西也不同。」\n\n\n\n  「那麼，他有什麼事情是他做了我們沒做？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「護膚啊，BB霜啊，面膜啊…………」老道掐著手指數著。\n\n\n\n  實在是許清朗的化妝品比白鶯鶯都多多了，當然，女殭屍那是一個例外，她反正青春永駐，永遠十六歲，也不需要化妝美白什麼的。\n\n\n\n  說著說著，\n\n\n\n  老道像是想起了什麼，\n\n\n\n  然後指著屋外院子裡的溫泉池子道：\n\n\n\n  「泡溫泉，只有他一個人泡了，我們都沒泡！」\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  老道最先脫去了衣服下了池子，池子的水還溫著，老道又放了一些熱水，躺在裡面，\n\n\n\n  美滴很美滴很。\n\n\n\n  只是，等許清朗過來泡的時候，老道有些嫉妒了。 \n\n\n\n  是的，如果來的是一個女人的話，他不會嫉妒，但對方是一個男人。\n\n\n\n  那吹彈可破的皮膚，那嬌嫩且修長的雙腿，那在水霧之下有些朦朦朧的容顏，老道下意識地用浴巾遮住了某個位置。\n\n\n\n  然後低下頭，默念他僅會的一點點道家心經。\n\n\n\n  完嘍，\n\n\n\n  完嘍，\n\n\n\n  這下子額一世英名要毀嘍。\n\n\n\n  看看許娘娘的皮膚和身段，再看看自己乾瘦的身材，凸出的肋骨條兒，老榆樹皮一樣的肌膚，老道又默默地感嘆了一聲歲月催人老啊。\n\n\n\n  要想當初，自己剛剛出家時，那些香客姑娘們，誰不稱讚一聲俏道士？\n\n\n\n  歲月是把殺豬刀，殺豬刀啊殺豬刀。\n\n\n\n  老許也有些尷尬，他不是很習慣和人一起泡澡，其實，很多人都是這樣，類似於大學的男生澡堂子裡，也總不乏一些害羞到必須穿著內內才能進去洗澡的男生。\n\n\n\n  等到周澤從裡面走過來時，老道和許清朗一起看向了那邊。\n\n\n\n  老道心想，就老闆那個廢柴樣子，估計身上一堆贅肉吧，哪怕老闆不胖，但平時吃的又少，鍛鍊又少，脫去衣服後，身段兒估計還沒自己好呢。\n\n\n\n  但等到周澤走過來時，老道和許清朗都吃了一驚。 \n\n\n\n  只見周澤身上好幾處還沒還沒癒合的傷疤清晰可見，給他增添了一種戰爭片男主角的味道，同時肌肉部分菱角分明，他不是屬於那種健身肌肉男，但是脫去衣服後顯露出的精悍和精緻，也著實亮瞎了此時溫泉池子裡二人的鈦合金狗眼。\n\n\n\n  「不公平啊。」\n\n\n\n  老道有些無語，成天曬曬太陽看看報紙然後就躺在女僕腿上哼哼唧唧的男人，身材怎麼這麼好？\n\n\n\n  其實，周澤是知道原因的，自己每次開無雙之後，身體素質都會提一截，也的確不需要自己去怎麼鍛鍊了。\n\n\n\n  三人都坐進了池子裡，\n\n\n\n  老道開始給裡面倒玫瑰精油，撒花瓣，然後拿個浴巾給自己搓澡。\n\n\n\n  溫泉池子裡的熱氣也慢慢地升騰起來，\n\n\n\n  連視線都慢慢地開始變得模糊起來。\n\n\n\n  「你精油倒得太多了。」許清朗不滿道。\n\n\n\n  「反正是免費的，不倒白不倒嘛。」老道不屑道。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，搓澡的老道忽然發現有一隻腿正在自己小腿位置上輕輕地蹭著，那條腿很滑嫩。\n\n\n\n  許美人的腿？\n\n\n\n  肯定是了，老闆腿上肌肉好多，不是這個觸感。\n\n\n\n  嘿嘿， \n\n\n\n  唉，\n\n\n\n  嘿嘿，\n\n\n\n  唉，\n\n\n\n  老道心裡萬分糾結，他真的不想變彎，但在這個時候，卻又免不了心猿意馬起來。\n\n\n\n  那條腿又開始繼續往裡面深入，\n\n\n\n  哦，\n\n\n\n  哦，\n\n\n\n  哦哦哦，\n\n\n\n  老道下意識地倒吸一口涼氣，\n\n\n\n  聲音的音調都變了。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，老道心下一凜，對自己道：「不行，不行，我不能彎，不能彎！」\n\n\n\n  「老許，你什麼意思，還能不能好好洗澡！」老道對著許清朗喊道。\n\n\n\n  「你有病吧。」許清朗慵懶地回答道。\n\n\n\n  「那你撩撥我做什麼，有本事你撩撥老闆去啊，老道我不好這一口！」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「誰撩撥你了。」\n\n\n\n  「嘿，還不承認！」\n\n\n\n  老道伸手放入水池裡，抓住了那條腿，使勁往上一拉，然後自己整個人也站起來。\n\n\n\n  我讓你不承認，\n\n\n\n  讓你不承認！\n\n\n\n  「哈哈，被我抓住了吧！」 \n\n\n\n  老道站起身，卻發現老闆和許清朗有些發愣地看著他，而這次他看清楚了，許清朗坐在池子另一頭，和自己中間還隔著老闆呢，他的腿不可能有那麼長。\n\n\n\n  老道咽了口唾沫，\n\n\n\n  側過頭，\n\n\n\n  看見那一截被自己抓在手中的，\n\n\n\n  大腿…………",

    "content": "A severed thigh, just like that, was held in the Old Daoist's hand. When he looked at it, he was so scared that he even forgot to throw it away.\n\nAnd just at this moment, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang left the pool together. The two quickly changed clothes in the living room.\n\nAfter they left, the Old Daoist finally came to his senses. He hastily threw the thigh away and ran out of the hot spring pool as if fleeing. He originally wanted to put on clothes, but seeing the Boss and Xu Qinglang directly open the room door and prepare to leave, he simply grabbed a bathrobe, wrapped it around himself, and followed them out of the hotel.\n\nThe Old Daoist was not Xu Qinglang after all; he certainly didn't have the guts to stay alone inside a haunted house.\n\nThis resort's layout was very large, similar to a villa complex. The green spaces inside were also very well done. Generally, after completing check-in procedures at the reception, there would be a special greeter responsible for driving an electric sightseeing vehicle to take guests to their chosen villas. If one wanted to dine or go out, they could also call the reception to arrange pick-up and drop-off.\n\n\"Is it going to rain today?\" The Old Daoist raised his head, looking at the sky. The sky was covered in dense, dark clouds, as if a thunderstorm was about to break.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer, continuing to walk forward. Xu Qinglang followed behind Zhou Ze, his face grim.\n\nThey had experienced the incident at Sanxiang Village, so they were not unfamiliar with this kind of layout. As for the Old Daoist, due to his genuinely robust life force, he hadn't been able to enter Sanxiang Village last time, and still hadn't fully grasped what was happening now.\n\nAfter walking for about five minutes, they arrived at the reception building ahead. The left area on the first floor of the building was a restaurant, which served breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze and the two others walked into the building, they found many people, just like the Old Daoist, wearing bathrobes and walking in from outside, going straight into the restaurant to dine.\n\n\"Oh, it seems rich people all enjoy themselves this way, eh? Eating out wrapped in a bathrobe, that's what truly has flavor.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist was a bit shy at first, but seeing everyone else like this now, he relaxed.\n\nZhou Ze first walked towards the reception desk and found that all the staff there were gone. Except for the restaurant, all other areas were empty, not a single person was in sight.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze could only choose to enter the restaurant.\n\n\"Hello, sir, please show your room card.\" Here, there were indeed uniformed waiters.\n\nXu Qinglang handed the room card over. The other person swiped it, verified the room type and the number of people allowed to dine, and nodded.\n\n\"Enjoy your meal.\"\n\nAfterwards, the three walked inside.\n\nThere were many people inside. It was a buffet style. Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang found a place and sat down.\n\n\"Boss, how about I go get something for us to snack on first?\" The Old Daoist suggested.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the Old Daoist, then pointed to a person nearby.\n\nThe Old Daoist followed his gaze and saw a pretty young woman sitting there eating something. She wasn't bad-looking.\n\nThe pretty young woman picked up the milk in front of her and took a sip. Then, with a \"plop\" sound, the pretty young woman's eyeball actually fell out, directly landing into the milk cup.\n\nThe Old Daoist also subconsciously swallowed.\n\nThen, the pretty young woman reached into the milk cup and stirred, finally retrieving her eyeball, and put it back into her eye socket.\n\nThe Old Daoist swallowed twice more in succession.\n\n\"Still want to eat?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe Old Daoist immediately shook his head, and obediently sat down beside Zhou Ze.\n\nSo touching,\n\nTruly full of emotion,\n\nThis was the first time the Boss hadn't intentionally set him up, and even specifically told him that the food here couldn't be eaten!\n\nPerhaps he was used to being \"teased\" normally, so at this moment, the Old Daoist felt even more grateful to Zhou Ze. He had truly suffered too many losses like this in the past.\n\nIncluding the incident with eating steamed buns last time, which almost cost him half his old life, but that incident probably couldn't be blamed on the Boss either.\n\n\"Are there any big ghosts here?\" Xu Qinglang asked in a low voice.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, he wasn't sure. The incident at Sanxiang Village last time was due to the influence of that bronze ring. That bronze ring was still on him now. Usually when at the bookstore, he would have Bai Yingying keep it in the bedroom for safekeeping, but when going out, he would definitely carry it with him, just in case he might need it sometime, purely relying on luck.\n\nAs for the Yin-Yang Ledger, Zhou Ze couldn't possibly carry it with him. What if it vibrated a few times upon encountering another child or something? Should he go save them or not?\n\n\"Let's just observe for now.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and gently touched his face. A layer of cold sweat.\n\n\"The humidity here is very extreme,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, \"I feel that way too, like we're still soaking in the hot spring.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist just listened from the side, his gaze wandering around. He saw a young man at the table opposite them eating noodles while biting his own fingers, treating his fingers like garlic, eating them with great relish.\n\nHe saw the chef over there, when putting in rice noodles, was stirring them with his arm, and when taking them out of the pot, he was also directly scooping them with his hand, even though his arm was boiled bright red, he showed no fear.\n\nOh my god,\n\nThe Old Daoist watched and watched until he dared not watch anymore, and lowered his head,\n\nsilently looking pensive.\n\nHe wasn't particularly panicked or scared, since the Boss was right beside him. If the sky fell, there would be a taller person to hold it up.*\n\nActually, since ancient times, any place with many ghosts often implies two possible situations.\n\nOne is the presence of a great ghost, similar to a Ghost King, under whom mountain spirits, wild monsters, and wandering ghosts would naturally gather, like the former Madam Bai and Heishan Laoyao from \"A Chinese Ghost Story.\"\n\nThe other possibility is the influence of a special magical artifact here; for example, Sanxiang Village last time existed precisely due to the influence of that bronze ring.\n\nIf it's merely the influence of a magical artifact, then the problem is minor. After all, magical artifacts have no good or evil, nor any intelligence. But if this Mount Jiangjun is a Ghost King's domain**, then the problem would be significant.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't afraid of angering that Ghost King, but rather didn't want to add too much trouble.\n\nHe came here simply because of that \"ghost call.\" He just wanted to complete his original planned mission. Of course, if he could take away all the ghosts here, that would be for the best. Boss Zhou, who had just become a permanent employee, had a very pitiful performance record now.\n\n\"That family of three is here,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAt the entrance, that family of three walked over and sat down at the table right next to Zhou Ze and the others. The daughter sat in her seat, while the father and mother went to get food.\n\nThen,\n\nThe father and mother brought back a lot of food.\n\nThe family of three sat on their chairs, stiffly, facing the food on the table, motionless.\n\nThey had no heads, so naturally they couldn't eat.\n\n\"Is that them?\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"That's right, it's them,\" Xu Qinglang nodded in confirmation.\n\nZhou Ze understood, stood up, and actively walked over, sitting down in the empty seat next to the father.\n\n\"Can you speak?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe family of three remained silent.\n\n\"I'm here to help you. You can tell me who killed you. You want to find your heads, right? I can help you.\"\n\nZhou Ze explained.\n\nThe family of three continued to remain silent.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the little girl,\n\n\"She's so young, her life had just begun, and she was murdered. As parents, aren't you angry?\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThe wife's arm rose, her finger placed in the soup in front of her, dipping in the liquid, and began writing on the table.\n\nZhou Ze watched carefully,\n\nand then his expression changed.\n\nNot because the woman wrote anything shocking or outrageous,\n\nbut because the woman seemed unaware that a piece of green vegetable was still stuck to her finger. As she wrote a character, the vegetable leaf also swept back and forth over it,\n\nZhou Ze couldn't understand what was written at all!\n\nBut the woman continued to write seriously. She wanted to avenge her daughter, but the more seriously she wrote, the more of a pain in the ass*** Zhou Ze felt. He couldn't understand it!\n\n\"The characters are smudged. Take the vegetable leaf off,\" Zhou Ze reminded.\n\nJust then,\n\nSeveral waiters at the service desk upfront shouted, \"Meal service ended!\"\n\n\"Whoosh-la-la………………\"\n\nEveryone who was dining stood up together. Even Zhou Ze and the Old Daoist also stood up, following the crowd. Then, everyone in the restaurant, including chefs and waiters, began to queue up and walk out. Everything, everything was orderly, as if it had been rehearsed countless times.\n\nThis family of three was the same. They stood up and walked towards the exit.\n\nZhou Ze reached out to grab the husband's wrist, but the husband passed directly through him. Zhou Ze extended his claws, but still couldn't grab them.\n\nAt this, Zhou Ze became enraged. All ten of his claws extended fully, and black mist immediately spread out.\n\nHe was ready to cause trouble,\n\nno longer playing charades with them.\n\nHowever, his claws, which had previously been unfailingly effective against soul bodies, seemed to have lost all their use at this moment. The people around them continued to go about their business as usual, completely unaffected.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly,\n\nThey,\n\naren't ghosts?\n\nIf not ghosts, not souls, then what were they?\n\nSoon, everyone in the restaurant was gone, leaving only Zhou Ze, the Old Daoist, and Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Boss, what just happened?\" The Old Daoist stepped forward and asked. He had just seen the Boss strike a pose and thought he was about to cause a scene, but who would have thought, much ado about nothing?****\n\n\"These guys aren't departed souls,\" Zhou Ze said with great certainty.\n\n\"If not departed souls, then what are they?\" The Old Daoist was dumbfounded.\n\n\"It might be some kind of magnetic field,\" Xu Qinglang speculated. \"Mount Jiangjun might have some mineral deposits inside, causing the magnetic field here to change, just like how lightning can record images from a long time ago. Ghosts exist everywhere, but this many here is clearly impossible. And this supernatural phenomenon has recorded all traces of ghost activity from all these years, which is why it gives us the illusion of there being so many ghosts here?\"\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. Zhou Ze answered the call. It was still that unknown number.\n\nThis time, the voice on the other end of the phone became incredibly clear:\n\n\"Save me………… save me………… I'm on Mount Jiangjun………… save me………… save me…………\"\n\n\"We're also on Mount Jiangjun! Where the hell are you?!\" The Old Daoist directly shouted into the phone.\n\n\"They're coming………… they're coming………… coming………… ah…………\"\n\nA scream came from the phone.\n\nThen there was a burst of static,\n\nanother confusing ghost call, with not a single bit of valuable information.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze was about to hang up the phone,\n\na voice suddenly came from the other end of the line again:\n\n\"Amitabha!\"\n\n\"It's the bald ass!\" The Old Daoist exclaimed excitedly. \"Bald ass, there's a bald ass causing trouble here! This humble Daoist has finally discovered the truth!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned, and exchanged a glance with Xu Qinglang. Zhou Ze asked, \"Did that voice just now sound familiar?\"\n\nXu Qinglang also nodded, \"It does sound a bit familiar.\"\n\nNext,\n\na second sentence came from the phone:\n\n\"Amitabha, this humble Daoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"\n___\n*An idiom meaning there's no need to worry, as someone more capable will handle the problem.\n**Literally \"dharma ground\" or \"place of execution,\" referring to a powerful entity's sphere of influence or territory.\n***A slang term indicating annoyance, frustration, or absurdity.\n****An idiom (literally \"loud thunder, small raindrops\") meaning a lot of talk or threat with little actual action.",

    "content": "「『Amitabha, this humble Taoist has finally found you, hehehe!』」\n\nWhen this sentence played from the phone, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang both turned their gazes to the Old Taoist Priest beside them.\n\nThe expression on the Old Taoist Priest's face was rich and varied: there was shock, terror, bewilderment, and helplessness.\n\nYes, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had said before that the voice sounded a little familiar. Now it was proven that it was, in fact, the Old Taoist Priest's voice. However, human voices transmitted from a phone inevitably suffer some distortion and change, and Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang hadn't expected the Old Taoist Priest's voice to appear in it, so they were caught by darkness under the lamp.*\n\nBut adding \"this humble Taoist\" after the \"Amitabha\" was a common habitual phrase for the Old Taoist Priest, especially the \"hehehe\" that followed, which fully showcased the Old Taoist Priest's roguish manner.**\n\nThe Old Taoist Priest was a Taoist priest; his real name, which he himself might sometimes forget, was Lu Fangweng. Lu You, an ancient poet, also went by the name \"Fangweng\" and was known as Lu Fangweng, but despite sharing a name with an ancient great poet, the Old Taoist Priest's conduct was far more unreliable.\n\nDabbling in shady businesses and living a vagabond life***, he had done almost everything in his decades of rough-and-tumble existence. He always considered himself a Taoist priest, yet he possessed not a shred of a Taoist's proper conduct. Besides the inexhaustible ancestral talismans he always kept tucked away in his trousers, almost no other characteristic of a Taoist priest could be found on him.\n\nEven his usual catchphrase, \"Wuliang Tianzun,\" he often mispronounced as \"Amitabha.\"\n\nSeeing the Boss and Xu Qinglang's gazes fixed on him, the Old Taoist Priest gave an awkward smile, pointed at his own face, and said:\n\n\"You can't possibly think this humble Taoist is the mastermind, can you?\"\n\nWell, generally speaking, in a mystery drama, the most inconspicuous and unlikely character at the beginning often steps forward at the end, tearing off their veil to give everyone a surprise—they turn out to be the killer—while those who were very lively and immediately suspected from the start are often innocent.\n\nBut when it came to the Old Taoist Priest, was he the mastermind? Was he orchestrating all of this from behind the scenes?\n\nXu Qinglang and Zhou Ze both slightly shook their heads. \"Let's get out first.\"\n\n\"Mm, right.\"\n\nThe two turned around and walked out of the restaurant.\n\nThe Old Taoist Priest was initially a little nervous, fearing that the Boss and the others had misunderstood something, but seeing the Boss and Old Xu simply abandon their suspicions, the Old Taoist Priest suddenly felt a bit dejected.\n\nThis feeling of being \"trusted\" didn't seem to be all that pleasant.\n\n\"Boss, why don't you reconsider just a little bit............\"\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang continued walking forward without looking back.\n\n\"Even just for show............\"\n\nThe Old Taoist Priest was a little helpless and could only follow them out.\n\nAfter leaving the restaurant and returning all the way to the rented villa, they didn't see a single pedestrian on the way. The three of them returned to the side of the hot spring pool.\n\nZhou Ze first stepped into the hot spring, buried his face in it, and when he raised his head, he wiped away the water droplets from his face. The dark clouds in the sky and the oppressive atmosphere from before had already vanished.\n\nIt seemed they were right; this entrance was actually this hot spring.\n\nThe Old Taoist Priest and Xu Qinglang also returned, their clothes soaking wet. Clearly, the space they were in before was not a completely independent place but a supernatural \"environment\" based on the real world.\n\nFor example, when they were lying in the hot spring earlier, Zhou Ze and the others were unclothed. It was only after the Old Taoist Priest fished out a thigh from the pool that they ran out of the pool, put on clothes, and left the room.\n\nAnd now, the clothes were still on the three of them, and the Old Taoist Priest was still wrapped in a bathrobe.\n\nThe hot spring pool was somewhat like a hypnotic pendulum, allowing you to see more things, but in reality, you might have only seen \"illusions\"; your physical self was still walking and moving in reality.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze couldn't help but wonder if there were many \"madmen\" in this world who liked to utter strange words and were considered \"mentally ill, abnormal\" by those around them. Did that mean that they could actually see a \"world\" based on reality that ordinary people simply couldn't?\n\nOf course, this was like how many murder cases remained undiscovered and uninvestigated among the countless reported natural and accidental deaths worldwide each year. The specific circumstances were truly unknowable.\n\nXu Qinglang took off his clothes, put on a bathrobe, then walked to Zhou Ze, motioning for Zhou Ze to take off his wet clothes as well. Afterward, he hung both their clothes outside on a hanger to dry.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the living room sofa, idly playing with his phone.\n\nThe Old Taoist Priest sat beside him, steeping tea with recently boiled water from an electric kettle, and proactively handed a cup to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the teacup, swirled it, and said, \"Old Xu, have you seen a movie called *The Shining*?\"\n\n\"That horror film?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Mm, I think the situation we're currently in is somewhat similar to *The Shining* — the indistinguishable reality and illusion, plus the scene where former guests who died here or nearby were all dining together here. It's very much like that photograph in *The Shining*.\"\n\n\"So, what's your point?\" Xu Qinglang took a sip of tea. \"Is your appetite that big?****\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I don't want to deal with this place's secrets for now; it's here anyway, and there'll be plenty of opportunities later. To be honest, I've almost forgotten why we came here.\n\nNever mind. Let's find the killer of that family of three first before talking about anything else. The key is that phantom call; we need to figure it out, or I'll just feel uneasy.\"\n\nSpeaking of the phantom call, Zhou Ze looked at the Old Taoist Priest again. How did the Old Taoist Priest's voice appear in the phone call?\n\nCould it be that the person on the phone was a ventriloquist? Knowing how to imitate the Old Taoist Priest's voice and manner of speaking?\n\n\"Ding-dong... Ding-dong...\"\n\nSomeone was pressing the doorbell outside.\n\nThe Old Taoist Priest got up and opened the door. A server stood outside, asking with some concern, \"Hello, I'm here to ask if you need any assistance?\"\n\n\"Assistance?\" The Old Taoist Priest was a little bewildered.\n\n\"It's like this: earlier, I saw the three of you wandering and talking in the restaurant. I called out to you, but you didn't respond, so I specifically came over to check. If you gentlemen are hungry and wish to dine, we can start a little earlier, especially since there aren't many guests staying now.\"\n\n\"No need, thank you.\" The Old Taoist Priest declined.\n\n\"Alright then, I won't disturb your rest.\" The server smiled and nodded.\n\nThe Old Taoist Priest closed the door, then called out to Zhou Ze and the others inside, \"Boss, the hotel server came to see if we were collectively sleepwalking, haha.\"\n\n\"Next time, let's not all go in together. At least one or two people should stay outside and watch,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. \"My complexion is terrible right now. I'll go wash my face, do some skincare, and then we can make further plans tonight.\"\n\n\"Alright, let's rest first.\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nImmediately afterward, Zhou Ze got up from the living room and walked to the side of the hot spring pool, pointing at it. \"Old Taoist Priest, you initially found a human leg here, right?\"\n\n\"That's right, a woman's leg, I suppose. If it were a man's, it would probably have to be... \" the Old Taoist Priest said, subtly glancing into the room.\n\nIt should be noted that he had genuinely mistaken it at first, thinking Old Xu was teasing him.\n\n\"Drain the water from the pool,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe Old Taoist Priest nodded. By this time, the hot spring pool had cooled down; although the water was still warm, there was no more mist. The Old Taoist Priest, barefoot, went down and pulled out the stopper, and the water slowly began to drain.\n\n\"The human leg... it should be real.\" Zhou Ze lit a cigarette and quietly said: \"This incident seems to be quite significant. That family of three might just be a catalyst. The family of three had their heads cut off, and it turns out there was once a leg in this hot spring pool.\"\n\nExhaling a smoke ring, \"After the case of the family of three, this hot spring hotel could still continue operating because that family of three died on their way down the mountain after checking out, not due to an accident that occurred inside the hotel.\n\nBut the truth doesn't seem to be that way. Old Xu had said before that the family of three were searching for their lost heads in the hotel room. Now, it seems that someone dismembered a body here and left a leg an unknown time ago. Although the leg is no longer visible, the fact that we could see it in that state means it was once present.\"\n\n\"Boss, are you suspecting the killer is an internal staff member of this hotel?\"\n\n\"Not just that.\" Zhou Ze flicked off his cigarette ash. \"I'm even starting to wonder if this is a hot spring resort hotel or a slaughterhouse.\"\n\nSaying this, Zhou Ze tried to extend the fingernails on his left hand. Immediately, a ball of black mist condensed in his palm. Afterward, Zhou Ze plunged his fingernails into the edge of the hot spring pool.\n\nThis was a method Zhou Ze used before to find nearby lingering spirits. Now, he was just giving it a casual try, as there were no other clues anyway.\n\nWho knew it was better not to try? With one try, he actually found black footprints here.\n\nThis trail of footprints extended from the hot spring pool all the way into the living room.\n\nThere really were some? Zhou Ze raised his head and followed the trail of footprints.\n\nThe footprints took a turn in the living room and went straight into the bathroom.\n\nMeanwhile, Xu Qinglang was in the bathroom, washing his face with facial cleanser. He was currently applying skincare products to his face in front of the mirror, meticulously smoothing them onto his reflection.\n\nAnd the footprints, after extending to the bathroom sink, began to go upward, indicating that whatever it was had climbed onto the sink.\n\nAfter climbing onto the sink, where did it go?\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\n\"What?\" Xu Qinglang asked while continuing to pat his face in the mirror.\n\nZhou Ze gently scraped the mirror surface with his fingernail.\n\nXu Qinglang stopped the patting motion of his hands.\n\nBut the reflection of himself in the mirror continued to meticulously and carefully pat its face, showing no intention of stopping at all.\n\n\"Pat pat pat............\"\n\n---\n*   \"Darkness under the lamp\" (灯下黑): An idiom meaning to overlook something obvious that is right under one's nose, or a blind spot in one's immediate surroundings.\n**   \"Roguish manner\" (賤樣): Implies a mischievous, perhaps slightly contemptible or low-brow but often humorous demeanor.\n*** \"Dabbling in shady businesses and living a vagabond life\" (捞偏门, 走江湖): \"Dabbling in shady businesses\" refers to engaging in unconventional or illicit ways of making money. \"Living a vagabond life\" (literally \"walking the rivers and lakes\") refers to a wandering lifestyle, often associated with performing arts, fortune-telling, or other trades practiced while traveling.\n**** \"Is your appetite that big?\" (胃口這麼大？): An idiom implying that one is being overly ambitious or greedy.",

    "content": "So, when you're idle, don't just idly stare into mirrors;\n\nThis habit is truly bad.\n\nBecause you never know,\n\nwhether the person in the mirror is truly just your reflection, only mechanically following your every move;\n\nOr,\n\nif he's just treating you like a fool, playing with you, and secretly, behind your back, silently gloating and chuckling to himself when he sees that you still haven't discovered his presence.\n\nThe one in the mirror stopped patting his face after about seven or eight seconds. He stood in the mirror, at first, still wanting to continue mimicking Xu Qinglang's current pose.\n\nBut then he thought,\n\nlooking at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang's current expressions, he also clearly realized that if he kept pretending, it seemed a bit pointless.\n\nBefore, he had treated others like fools, following a man to apply skincare products, patting his face, and finding it very amusing. Now, if he continued to pretend, he would just be treating himself like a fool.\n\nHe silently retreated, his figure receding further and further, shrinking smaller and smaller. He wanted to leave here.\n\nZhou Ze believed that even when police academies taught methods of apprehending and pursuing criminals, they definitely wouldn't teach how to catch a criminal if they hid inside a mirror.\n\nBut now, he was facing this exact problem.\n\nFirst, breaking the mirror was out of the question; presumably, the person inside was probably itching for him to do so. But going into the mirror?\n\nZhou Ze reached out and tried; his hand couldn't pass through. Evidently, this attempt also failed. Of course, Zhou Ze hadn't held much hope to begin with.\n\nIf mirrors could really be passed through by just anyone, then the number of children who accidentally fell into mirrors and disappeared each year would definitely be far, far greater than those who drowned swimming in rivers.\n\nThat asshole in the mirror ran further and further, shrinking smaller and smaller. He even turned back with interest and made a \"cut throat\" gesture towards Zhou Ze and the others; he was truly arrogant indeed.\n\n\"Heaven's Zenith, Limitless, Profound Heart Righteous Law!\"\n\nXu Qinglang formed a hand seal with both hands, and a heart-protecting mirror was directly slapped onto the mirror surface by him.\n\nIt had to be said, Lao Xu's movements, whether forming the seal or taking out the heart-protecting mirror, were perfect, exuding an aura of grandeur befitting a mystic¹. But after the heart-protecting mirror was affixed, the person in the mirror merely tilted their head, seemingly still smiling. Evidently, Lao Xu's method was ineffective.\n\n\"Lao Dao, crotch!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nLao Dao subconsciously reached to touch his crotch,\n\nAnd then,\n\nhe actually pulled out another talisman!\n\nBear in mind, Lao Dao wasn't wearing a Daoist robe now, but a bathrobe! This also meant that Lao Dao had transferred the talisman after changing clothes!\n\n\"Grand Pure Heavenly Venerable, act quickly by my command! Western Buddha, heed my call!\"\n\nMuttering a hodgepodge incantation, Lao Dao directly affixed his talisman onto the mirror.\n\nThe talisman glowed red for a moment, and the image in the mirror also distorted for a moment. The person inside seemed to let out a small cry of pain, but he still didn't come out. And it seemed as if, stimulated by the talisman, he, who had originally intended to stay put and act cool², truly began to prepare his escape.\n\n\"Any more?\" Zhou Ze urged Lao Dao.\n\nHe refused to believe that if ten or eight of these were stuck on this mirror, the guy inside wouldn't be forced out.\n\nLao Dao reached in and rummaged again, then opened his hand. In his palm, besides a few black curly hairs,\n\nthere was nothing else.\n\n\"Nope, Boss, only brought one today.\"\n\nAt this moment, the person in the mirror was reduced to a small black dot, almost completely disappearing.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes, spread his hands, his fingernails extended fully, and layers of black mist began to rise from his palms. For Zhou Ze, there was only one method left to try.\n\nFacing something incomprehensible, it seemed he had to try an incomprehensible method.\n\nUnder the gaze of Lao Dao and Xu Qinglang, who were looking at him like an idiot, Zhou Ze gripped the air in front of him with both hands and began to assume a tug-of-war stance.\n\nIn reality, Zhou Ze hadn't actually grabbed anything, but he was still pulling backward, as if he genuinely held something in his hands, and he pulled with considerable effort.\n\nDid he have to be so over the top?\n\nDid he have to be so imaginative?\n\nLao Dao's mouth twitched. He really wanted to tell the Boss that this method was even less reliable, but soon Lao Dao's mouth stiffened, because he saw that the guy in the mirror, who had originally been just a dot, was actually slowly moving back.\n\nOh my goodness!\n\nHe was actually pulled back by the Boss!\n\nLao Dao suddenly felt he couldn't quite understand this world anymore. This works too?\n\n\"Help me!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nHelp you?\n\nXu Qinglang and Lao Dao froze for a moment, then also joined in, mimicking helping Zhou Ze pull. Xu Qinglang felt like the ministers in \"The Emperor's New Clothes,\" doing something very foolish, but the crucial point was that with his and Lao Dao's participation, the guy in the mirror's backward movement really sped up!\n\n\"If you believe in your heart you can pull him back, then you can pull him back. He's in the mirror, but actually, he's more in our eyes.\" Zhou Ze uttered a very philosophical remark.\n\nA mirror's function is to reflect light; it merely acts as a medium. Rather than saying there's something in the mirror, it's more like there's something existing in our own eyes.\n\nOf course, this involves many philosophical arguments, and if one were to delve into it deeply, it would be too troublesome.\n\nAs they pulled and pulled, the person in the mirror gradually returned to the same size as when Xu Qinglang had just applied skincare products.\n\nHe was about to be pulled out,\n\nhe was about to come out,\n\nPull hard!\n\nA little harder!\n\nHe's almost out!\n\nLao Dao was shouting from the side, chanting a work song. Vaguely, he felt as if he had returned to his years as a porter on the docks, but as he chanted, it sounded more like three grown men acting as midwives.\n\nFinally, a corner of the thing's clothing in the mirror was revealed.\n\nBut then,\n\na crisp \"crack\" sound was heard, and this mirror actually shattered directly.\n\nThen a black shadow was seen emerging from inside. Perhaps Zhou Ze and the others were too immersed, for the three of them actually fell backward together, as if the rope in a tug-of-war competition had suddenly broken.\n\nThis left Zhou Ze feeling both amused and exasperated. When he quickly stood up and realized he needed to grab that black shadow, he found that he had already lost the initiative.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails merely snagged the opponent, and after hearing a miserable shriek from within that black shadow, the black shadow actually shrank again, escaping Zhou Ze's control.\n\nIt then burrowed into another glass door elsewhere in the bathroom.\n\nOnly this time, he seemed unable to fully burrow in; a part of him remained outside, like a blood leech. This was probably due to his injury, affecting his performance.\n\nZhou Ze directly swept his fingernails across, the glass door shattered directly, the black shadow let out another shriek, and fled again, like a wild rabbit, moving very fast.\n\n\"Don't let him escape! He can only hide in reflective objects. You guys go search, I'll trap him first!\"\n\nZhou Ze plunged his fingernails into the ground simultaneously, and black energy instantly spread out, completely enveloping the entire small villa. Zhou Ze had done something similar when facing the attack of that water python back then, but that time was for self-preservation, whereas this time was an active confinement.\n\nMeanwhile, Lao Dao and Xu Qinglang rushed out of the bathroom and began to search for reflective objects to see if that thing was hidden inside.\n\nThe beginning of the matter was unbelievable, but the process of it was even more astounding. As for it directly turning into a game of hide-and-seek now, it was something no one had expected.\n\nIn truth, at its core, it was because Lao Dao and Xu Qinglang were both living people. Living people on this world abide by birth, aging, illness, and death; they had science, reason, and rules to follow. And therefore, their perspective was sometimes not as broad as Zhou Ze's.\n\nFor someone who had once been to Hell, there was nothing that couldn't be accepted, and nothing that was impossible.\n\nThe search process was troublesome and tedious, because there were too many reflective objects here. To check them one by one, and also to guard against the possibility of the opponent moving location, even though Zhou Ze had already confined the area to this small villa, truly pulling that thing out was not a simple matter.\n\nLao Dao searched around, found nothing, and had no clue. He felt like he was going crazy, his mind was full of glass, he wished he could turn into glass himself.\n\nXu Qinglang also searched around and found nothing. They were also embarrassed to ask Zhou Ze if he had truly trapped that thing. What if the thing wasn't in the villa and had already escaped?\n\n\"Oh right, the hot spring!\"\n\nLao Dao ran to the edge of the hot spring. The water in the hot spring pool had already been drained, but there were still several puddles of accumulated water. These could also reflect light, and could also serve as mirrors!\n\nLao Dao jumped into the hot spring basin, searching puddle by puddle, but still found nothing.\n\nFeeling somewhat exhausted, Lao Dao simply sat down at the bottom of the hot spring basin.\n\nCan't find it,\n\nThat thing could burrow into mirrors, heaven knows where else it ran off to. Amitābha, Immeasurable Heavenly Venerable, Merciful Lord, please show your divine power, and let this humble Daoist find him.\n\nZhou Ze in the bathroom was close to collapsing, and kept shouting from the bathroom, asking if they had found it.\n\nThis increased Lao Dao's pressure.\n\nDamn it, if only he could call the police to help search for the person, Lao Dao thought wildly to himself. Then he suddenly froze, and pulled his phone out of his pocket.\n\nA phone screen is also a mirror, isn't it? It can also reflect light!\n\nAnd it had been on him the whole time—the most easily overlooked spot!³\n\nLao Dao immediately pressed the phone screen, and the screen lit up. Originally, Lao Dao's screensaver was the classic photo of Marilyn Monroe's skirt blowing up, but now, on the screen, a patch of black shadow had appeared under Marilyn Monroe's skirt, like a layer of pixelation, and it was wriggling.\n\nLao Dao was so happy that a bubble even formed near his nose,\n\nlooking extremely excited,\n\nand immediately reached out to grab that \"pixelation,\" muttering excitedly:\n\n\"Amitābha, this humble Daoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: \"B格\" (B gé) is internet slang, short for \"逼格\" (bī gé), which conveys a sense of \"swag,\" \"class,\" \"style,\" or \"coolness,\" often with a slightly pretentious or showy connotation.\n² Translator's Note: \"裝逼\" (zhuāngbī) is internet slang that means to \"put on airs,\" \"show off,\" or \"act cool/pretentious.\"\n³ Translator's Note: \"燈下黑\" (dēngxiàhēi) literally translates to \"darkness under the lamp,\" meaning something obvious is overlooked because it's too close or familiar.",

    "content": "\"Amitābha, this humble Taoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"\n\nAfter saying this, the Old Taoist began to vigorously rub his hands on the screen. This thing had been injured by Boss Zhou before, and now, even when it drilled into the mirror, it wasn't as nimble as it used to be. Boss could break the mirror and force this thing out before, and the Old Taoist felt he could do the same.\n\nBut as he kept rubbing, the Old Taoist suddenly froze. He recalled what he had just said, and suddenly felt a chill down his spine, then instinctively swallowed.\n\nNo way...\n\nThis should just be a coincidence.\n\nYes, it's precisely because he heard the previous words on the phone that an impression was formed in his mind, and it just blurted out.\n\nYes,\n\nIt must be like this.\n\nThere was another possibility, one the Old Taoist dared not think of, truly dared not think of.\n\nAs he kept rubbing, a layer of something resembling the black grime and dirt from someone who hadn't bathed in a long time was rubbed off. The Old Taoist pinched it with two fingers, then pulled hard to draw it out.\n\n\"I found it!\"\n\nAt the same time, the Old Taoist, recovering from his shock, finally remembered to call for help.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately ran over. Seeing the Old Taoist pulling something out of the phone, he immediately realized what was happening and watched closely from the side, fearing the thing would run away again.\n\nZhou Ze also finally pulled his fingernail out of the ground, letting out a long sigh. In the past, he'd watched people in immortal heroes novels or TV dramas effortlessly turn things to dust with a flick of their hand, fighting until mountains collapsed, earth split, and water flowed backward. A Dou Zong expert was truly terrifying like this...\n\nBut when it was his turn, he realized the gap between fantasy and reality was truly vast; he had only been at it for a moment and was already a bit sore in the back from exhaustion.\n\nThe Old Taoist pulled that thing out and pressed it firmly with both hands. Actually, you couldn't feel its presence; in fact, his hands were completely clasped together, seamless, as if there was nothing inside at all.\n\nBut there was indeed a sensation stimulating you: that wet, slippery, slightly cold feeling, constantly telling you that there was indeed something in your palm.\n\n\"Boss, here!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze approach, the Old Taoist immediately stood up and handed this \"hot potato\" to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and took it. It was a layer of black sphere—no, now it looked like a black rag. But just to be safe, Zhou Ze directly pierced through its middle with his fingernail, like skewering a kebab, as this thing was simply too good at running and hiding.\n\nAny soul-type entity seemed to be restrained by Zhou Ze's fingernails. After this guy was pierced by Zhou Ze's fingernail, it kept \"spinning\" and \"jumping,\"\n\nlooking very pained.\n\n\"What are you............\"\n\nZhou Ze hadn't even finished his first question,\n\nwhen he heard the sound of a balloon popping,\n\nthe black thing pierced on his fingertip actually burst open directly, turning into wisps of smoke.\n\n\"............\" The Old Taoist.\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe Old Taoist had ten thousand curses in his heart he didn't know whether to utter, but his strong desire for survival still made him swallow his thoughts. The Old Taoist had deeply grasped the path of following his heart^1, and immediately said:\n\n\"Boss, this guy's bones are too hard; he'd rather die than yield.\"\n\nHe wouldn't accuse Zhou Ze of directly ruining the other party, not after they had been busy for so long yet hadn't even gotten a single word out of it.\n\nXu Qinglang took a deep breath. He wanted to curse, but was too lazy to.\n\n\"My apologies.\" Zhou Ze looked a bit embarrassed. Everyone had expended so much effort to catch this thing, and it ended up having a problem in his hands. \"I didn't expect it to be so fragile.\"\n\nThe three of them returned to the living room. The atmosphere was a bit heavy. They had originally thought a turning point had appeared, and a breakthrough seemed imminent, but with that sound:\n\n\"Pop!\"\n\nthe whole matter returned to square one.\n\n\"Boss, at least we've confirmed one thing: this hotel definitely has something fishy going on!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist said very seriously and earnestly, not feeling at all that he had stated the obvious.\n\n\"Should we rest now, or go for another bath?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Let's rest first,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at the time. \"It's almost eight now. We'll go for another bath around one or two in the morning.\"\n\nThe three of them didn't return to their rooms to rest; they simply made do lying on the living room sofa and tatami mat. Actually, Zhou Ze wanted to go back to his room to sleep, but Xu Qinglang and the Old Taoist were clearly unwilling. The Old Taoist had always been shameless anyway and insisted on sticking with the boss, and although Xu Qinglang said no verbally, his body was very honest.\n\nNext to Zhou Ze, at least when something happened, there was someone who could directly confront it. But once he was alone, he would often be flustered and disorganized.\n\nThe Old Taoist didn't mention the matter of that sentence, because he thought it might be a coincidence, and he felt a bit uneasy in his heart.\n\nAround past eleven o'clock, the Old Taoist was woken up by his own urine. He dared not go to the bathroom. Firstly, the bathroom was indeed haunted today, and the Old Taoist was very afraid that while he was peeing, the family of three next to him would suddenly appear on the ground looking for their heads. That would scare him impotent.\n\nSecondly, too many horror stories and movies featured accidents happening during peeing and pooping. Knowing there was danger nearby, yet insisting on being alone, and caring about some \"thing\" at a critical moment, would often dig their own grave.\n\nSo, the Old Taoist simply reached for an empty mineral water bottle from the coffee table, preparing to relieve himself directly in the living room.\n\nJust as the Old Taoist unzipped his pants and prepared to \"turn on the faucet,\" he saw Zhou Ze on the opposite sofa, eyes open, watching him.\n\nThe Old Taoist immediately stopped in fright and said somewhat awkwardly, \"Boss, you're awake?\"\n\n\"I can't sleep,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nOnly then did the Old Taoist realize. Yes, Zhou Ze couldn't sleep at night without Bai Yingying; he had actually forgotten.\n\nZhou Ze got up, lit a cigarette, walked to the front of the living room directly facing the bathroom, pointed inside, and said, \"I'll watch, you go ahead and relieve yourself.\"\n\nMoved.\n\nIncredibly moved.\n\nA hundred, a thousand, ten thousand times moved!\n\nThe Old Taoist wished he could shed tears. Boss had changed, truly changed, becoming someone who takes care of his subordinates, becoming someone who cares for lonely elderly people.\n\nAlthough it seemed a bit late to understand these principles after living two lifetimes, but... it was worth it!\n\nBoss was actually willing to help him pee^2 at night!\n\nThe Old Taoist's inner monologue was very rich. Of course, it was truly Zhou Ze's unintentional action, but for him, the impact was really great.\n\n\"Alright, Boss.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist immediately entered the bathroom,\n\nThe door was not closed.\n\nStanding by the toilet, the Old Taoist could see Zhou Ze in the living room, and Zhou Ze could see him too. Very secure!\n\nThis feeling, super awesome!\n\n\"Boss lights the lamp, illuminating the ghost's home door, letting the lost little ghost find the way back;\nBoss lights the lamp, illuminating the ghost's future, with a bit of light, chilling the ghost's heart^3............\"\n\nThe Old Taoist was in a good mood, humming a little tune, unhurriedly taking out his \"faucet,\" searching for the most comfortable angle, then began to brew.\n\nHe was old,\n\nand the \"faucet\" inevitably rusted^4.\n\nSo, singing now was also to alleviate some embarrassment; otherwise, if he stood by the toilet for a long time and Boss didn't hear the sound of water, wouldn't he be very curious?\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He lowered his head to look, and found it was still that unknown number.\n\nThe origin of the whole matter actually came from this unknown phone call. It was like a string, constantly pulling him and the others to this hotel to investigate matters concerning this hotel.\n\nIndeed, the hotel did have problems, but the feeling of constantly being led by the nose made Zhou Ze very uncomfortable, and he disliked it greatly.\n\nBut no matter what, Zhou Ze still answered the call.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nthe phone transmitted words he had grown somewhat tired of hearing:\n\n\"Save me............ Save me............ I'm on General's Mountain............ Save me............ Save me............ Please............ save me............\"\n\nIt seemed his opening line was always this one.\n\nZhou Ze somewhat wanted to curse. If this guy were in front of him, Zhou Ze would probably step forward and slap him.\n\nTruly, could he just give a little, slightly useful information?\n\n\"I'm on General's Mountain,\" Zhou Ze replied weakly.\n\nBut this time, it seemed different.\n\nBecause the voice on the other end of the phone,\n\nseemed to have suddenly understood how to communicate.\n\nHe actually changed his usual Xianglin's Wife-esque speech^5:\n\n\"Really............ You came............ Did you really come............ Really............\"\n\n\"Yes, I came. Where are you? How should I save you?\"\n\nZhou Ze paid a little more attention, and felt some hope.\n\n\"Hehe............ It's good you came............ So good............ So good............ Thank you for coming to save me............ Really............ Thank you............ I'm very grateful to you............ Extremely, extremely grateful to you............\"\n\nA whole lot of thanks were said,\n\nbut still not a single bit^6 of useful information.\n\nZhou Ze interrupted the other party's incessant thanks, and directly said:\n\n\"Tell me something useful, otherwise I'll just go back tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Useful things............ Ah............ Right............ I'm sorry............ My brain............ has a bit of a problem............\"\n\nThat was known long ago.\n\n\"Oh............ I remembered............ I remembered............ how you should save me............ Oh no............ It's saving us............\"\n\n\"Hurry up.\"\n\n\"That is............ you replace us............ replace us in receiving punishment and suffering here............ then we............ then we can............ escape the sea of suffering............\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened.\n\nJust then,\n\nthe voice on the phone suddenly quickened its pace:\n\n\"Unexpected?\n\nSurprised?\n\nHow about,\n\nfirst, I pour you some red wine,\n\nto celebrate?\"\n\nRed wine?\n\nZhou Ze slightly frowned.\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nafter a long period of \"brewing,\" the Old Taoist finally released water,\n\nmaking a \"whooshing\" sound.\n\nJust as most people, after pooping on the toilet, their first action is to look back at their poop,\n\nthe Old Taoist also habitually lowered his head and looked at his nether regions,\n\nthen the Old Taoist's face suddenly changed,\n\nhe found that what he had peed out,\n\nwas blood,\n\nbright red blood!\n---\n1.  **The path of following his heart**: An ironic phrase in Chinese, implying cowardice or taking the easy way out.\n2.  **Help him pee**: A phrase typically used for helping young children urinate, used humorously here for an adult.\n3.  **Chilling the ghost's heart**: Literally \"making the ghost's heart catch a cold.\" This is likely a humorous or ironic twist on \"warming\" or \"lighting up\" the heart, given the song's context of lighting lamps for ghosts.\n4.  **The \"faucet\" inevitably rusted**: A euphemism for the difficulties an older man might face with urination.\n5.  **Xianglin's Wife-esque speech**: Refers to a character from Lu Xun's short story \"Blessing,\" known for repetitively complaining about her misfortunes.\n6.  **Not a single bit**: Literally \"butt point,\" an informal expression meaning \"a tiny bit,\" used here to emphasize the lack of information.",

    "content": "Suddenly, a ground-shaking sensation arose around him. Zhou Ze instinctively lowered his center of gravity to prevent himself from falling.\n\nHe saw Old Dao in the bathroom still holding onto his faucet and screaming;\n\nXu Qinglang, on the living room sofa, remained deep in sleep, seemingly feeling nothing amiss.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly realized that it wasn't an actual ground-shaking earthquake. Instead, all the light and shadows around him were severely distorted, creating the illusion of intense shaking.\n\nEverything reflective seemed to come alive at that moment. They became very active, actively trying to mislead and influence him.\n\nIt was an unfathomable sensation, as if, at this moment, he was being rejected by the entire surrounding environment. They were no longer inanimate objects around him, no longer tools he could use, discard, or tread upon at will. After gaining their own consciousness, they instinctively began to repel him, began to detest him.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth, wanting to wake Xu Qinglang, but when he called out, Xu Qinglang continued to sleep on the sofa, as if he hadn't heard anything at all.\n\nEven if he was dead asleep, he couldn't be that unresponsive.\n\n\"Old Dao!\"\n\nZhou Ze called out to Old Dao again.\n\nOld Dao stood in the bathroom, still staring at his faucet and yelling. No matter how Zhou Ze called out to him, he wouldn't turn his head.\n\nGradually, Zhou Ze noticed Old Dao's figure distorting. Xu Qinglang's body, still sleeping on the sofa, was also distorting. He felt as if he were in a funhouse mirror room, where all the surrounding light seemed to be bent, bringing an extremely painful visual impact.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze closed his eyes. He wasn't a novice ghost catcher anymore; in the past half-year, he had weathered many storms. He knew that in such a situation, the first thing to do was to calm his inner self.\n\nA heart clear as ice, unafraid even if the sky collapses!\n\nHowever, as soon as Zhou Ze closed his eyes, he suddenly felt a sensation of weightlessness beneath his feet, as if he were about to plummet into a cliff abyss the next moment.\n\nThis feeling often occurred during sleep: a sudden illusion of falling, after which the whole body would instinctively jolt awake, only to realize it was a false alarm.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze now, this feeling lasted for a long time and grew more intense.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to open his eyes. The moment he reopened them, streaks of white light suddenly erupted around him, a brightness like a car in front suddenly flashing its high beams at night.\n\nAfter a moment of dizziness and blindness, when Zhou Ze's vision cleared again, he found himself still standing in the living room.\n\nEverything around him was unchanged, as if everything that had just happened was merely an invalid illusion, a shimmering mirage. But soon, Zhou Ze realized something was wrong.\n\nThe sofa was still the same sofa, but Xu Qinglang, who had been on it, was gone.\n\nThe bathroom was still the same bathroom, but Old Dao, who had been bleeding urine in it, was also gone.\n\nThe furnishings were all there, nothing had changed, but he was the only one left, and he was alone.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. The lights were on, but their brightness was clearly insufficient, in fact, very low, making everything appear dim and heavy.\n\nHe walked into the bathroom. Through the remaining cracked mirror surface on the wall, Zhou Ze suddenly saw the figures of Old Dao and Xu Qinglang in the mirror.\n\nOld Dao leaned against the wall, his face filled with terror, with blood all over beneath him. Xu Qinglang was beside him, attending to him and also seeming to comfort Old Dao.\n\nThey were in the mirror?\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily stunned. Then, Zhou Ze saw Xu Qinglang helping Old Dao out of the bathroom. He could no longer see them.\n\n\"Hey! Can you hear me?\"\n\nZhou Ze called out. There was no response. Afterward, Zhou Ze exited the bathroom and walked into the living room. The living room had a large photo frame containing an oil painting of Eight Steeds. Through the mirror's surface, Zhou Ze saw Old Dao sitting on the sofa in the living room, and Xu Qinglang bringing him a cup of water.\n\nFollowing that, Xu Qinglang lit a talisman, dissolved it into the cup of water, and handed it to Old Dao to drink.\n\nOld Dao, painfully furrowing his brows, gulped down the talisman water and kept exhaling.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hear their voices at all; he could only see their images and movements.\n\nIt wasn't until Zhou Ze saw himself there too, in the mirrored scene, that Zhou Ze's heart sank.\n\nThings,\n\nhad truly taken an unimaginable turn.\n\nHis body on the sofa was just lying there, motionless.\n\nXu Qinglang and Old Dao periodically looked at his body on the sofa with concerned gazes. Xu Qinglang even used a wet towel to wipe his face, but he felt nothing.\n\nPhew...\n\nHe understood.\n\nIt wasn't that they had somehow entered the mirror without realizing it.\n\nIn fact,\n\nthe one who had truly entered the mirror,\n\nwas himself!\n\nZhou Ze tried to scratch at the mirror surface with his fingernails. He instinctively wanted to break this thing and get out, but his usually infallible fingernails were truly helpless against this small mirror surface at this moment. This mirror surface was as hard as King Kong, despairingly solid.\n\nAfter trying for a while, Zhou Ze gave up and sat down on the sofa.\n\nOnce seated, Zhou Ze realized that while the furnishings in the room were indeed the same, the arrangement was actually reversed. After all, things in a mirror are indeed the opposite of reality.\n\nHe reached out and felt around. Zhou Ze found his cigarettes still there. He pulled one out and put it in his mouth, and he could actually light it with a lighter. When he puffed, there was truly the scent of tobacco.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know what state he was in now. His body was still in reality, outside the mirror, but everything here now felt so real. It didn't seem like an out-of-body experience.\n\nZhou Ze had experienced an out-of-body state before; it was a very weak and bewildered feeling. But now there was clearly no such feeling, which meant that his soul hadn't been sucked inside, as it were.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that his fingernails had been useless against those \"departed souls\" in the restaurant that afternoon. This seemed to imply that he was currently in the same state as those \"departed souls\" dining in the restaurant?\n\nNot a soul,\n\nnot a physical body,\n\na... very strange and indescribable state?\n\nThis was,\n\nthe state inside the mirror?\n\nThat night, Zhou Ze mostly sat on the sofa, thinking about how to get out, how to leave this place. Zhou Ze also tried opening the door to look outside, but he found that the main door, including the walls of the courtyard, were all sealed off by a layer of \"glass.\" He couldn't get out at all; he could only move within this confined area.\n\nSo, that night he either sat on the sofa pondering life or stood in front of the painting frame, watching how Old Dao and Xu Qinglang anxiously tried various methods to wake him up.\n\nIn truth, what Zhou Ze was most worried about was whether Xu Qinglang and Old Dao would take his body back to the bookstore in the city the next day.\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze had a very resolute character, he truly didn't want to be abandoned like this by his companions, even if his companions might not know that he was actually inside the mirror.\n\nZhou Ze even tried filling the hot spring pool and soaking in it a few times, only to find that even if he submerged his head in the pool, he still couldn't leave this area. Zhou Ze had tried and executed every possible method, and all had failed.\n\nIn short, this night was very long, so long that Zhou Ze felt a little suffocated.\n\nWhen a faint sunlight began to show outside, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head.\n\nIt's morning, isn't it?\n\n\"Crack... Crack...\"\n\nIt sounded like something was breaking. Zhou Ze stood up and walked to the door, reaching out to open it. He found that a piece of the glass outside had shattered, enough for a person to walk through normally.\n\nIt was like a tunnel for children in an amusement park. Zhou Ze walked into it. He could only walk forward along this single path because thin layers of glass surrounded him. You could see the people outside, see the scenery outside, but you just couldn't get out.\n\nNo matter how much force you used, you couldn't break even a shred of this layer of glass.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw a door. The door was open, and Zhou Ze walked in.\n\nThen,\n\nthe space suddenly opened up.\n\nAfter all, he had walked through a narrow glass corridor for over ten minutes. Suddenly walking into an open area truly gave him the feeling of a fisherman accidentally stumbling into the Peach Blossom Spring.*\n\nHowever, what Zhou Ze walked into was the restaurant.\n\nA buffet-style layout,\n\na familiar environment,\n\nit was the hotel's restaurant.\n\n\"Sir, your room card, please.\"\n\nA voice sounded beside Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look at her.\n\nIt was a server, but her mouth was above her eyes, and all her facial features were inverted, giving off a very unsettling feeling.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move.\n\nThe other party reached out, and he found a room card on himself.\n\n\"Hello, enjoy your meal.\" The server smiled faintly.\n\nThat smile was the most unsettling Zhou Ze had ever seen in his life. Picasso couldn't even paint such an effect.\n\nThere weren't many people in the restaurant, but after Zhou Ze sat down, more and more guests began to come in to dine. It was almost identical to yesterday's scene.\n\nExcept yesterday, Zhou Ze had been an observer. This time, he was in the game.\n\nHe didn't go to get food; he just sat back down in yesterday's spot. If this was the case, Zhou Ze really wanted to see if Xu Qinglang and Old Dao would also come through the hot spring pool.\n\nInstead of Xu Qinglang and Old Dao, Zhou Ze first saw the family of three. They also sat down in yesterday's spot. It was still the little girl who sat down first, while her parents went to get food.\n\nThen,\n\nthe headless family of three collectively stared blankly at the dazzling array of food before them.\n\n\"Hi, hello again,\" Zhou Ze said, finding a grim amusement.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe family of three, with whom he had been unable to communicate before, suddenly turned their bodies collectively towards Zhou Ze.\n\nThey had no heads,\n\nlogically they shouldn't be able to speak, as they couldn't even eat,\n\nBut they made a sound, a collective sound,\n\nthough it was just a simple word:\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\n------\nPS: Starting today, Long will be participating in an \"Online Author\" Grassroots Charity Event, going to an impoverished mountainous county.

    "content": "This “hi” carried a great sense of dark humor.\n\nPeople often thought that ghosts, well, they all carried immense resentment and a hysterical, deep-seated grievance; this was a preconceived notion people had.\n\nZhou Ze used to think so too, until he himself became a ghost.\n\nGhosts and humans, how much difference was there really?\n\nIn terms of malice,\n\nHumans know the horror of ghosts, ghosts know the poison of human hearts;\n\nIn other aspects,\n\nGhosts originate from humans; in many ways, whether in personality or senses, they actually have a deep sense of immersion with humans.\n\nThe only difference was perhaps that ghosts, for the most part, had an extreme personality somewhat akin to “desperadoes” or “fugitives”; it was difficult for them to linger in the human realm for too long. Even if there were some unexpected circumstances where they hadn't gone to hell and the Underworld Emissaries hadn't discovered them yet, dwelling in the human realm was more like rats hiding in the sewers.\n\nHumans feared ghosts, but in this world, there were far too many things that could harm and restrain ghosts.\n\nLike Old Daoist’s crotch.\n\nZhou Ze reached up, touched his head, and yawned. The suppression from the entire night before seemed to have dissipated quite a bit now. For someone who had even walked the Yellow Springs Road, there was nothing left to let go of.\n\nWanting to return, to go back to his own body, to his original life, that was natural.\n\nBut when a method hadn't been found yet, there was no need to be overly anxious or distressed.\n\n“Can you tell me now, who killed you?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe family of three was still looking at him,\n\nThen,\n\nSilence.\n\nThe feeling of being “stared” at by three headless people was truly unpleasant.\n\nEven Boss Zhou felt a bit uncomfortable now.\n\n“Ding-dong…”\n\nBeside Zhou Ze, there was the crisp sound of a spoon touching a plate. Then Zhou Ze turned around and saw a delicate-faced girl sitting next to him, seemingly preparing to eat.\n\nThe girl turned her head, glanced at Zhou Ze—oh no, she was actually looking at the family of three over there, giving them a gentle nod.\n\nWell,\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit heartbroken and haggard,\n\nSo, she was greeting someone else *across* from him, and he had misunderstood; it was indeed a bit awkward.\n\nThen,\n\nThe family of three sat up straight again, staring blankly at the food in front of them…\n\nThe girl, on the other hand, ate unhurriedly. She ate very elegantly; not with that constrained and overly refined manner. In fact, she ate quickly, yet displayed a unique demeanor.\n\nZhou Ze just watched the girl eat like that.\n\nFortunately, Old Daoist and Old Xu were still anxious over Zhou Ze's prolonged unconsciousness and hadn't thought to come back through the hot spring pool to check. Otherwise, if they had seen Zhou Ze staring intently at the eating girl as if nothing was wrong, they might really have fallen ill from anger.\n\nThe girl finished her meal, drank the last bit of milk from her cup, wiped her mouth with a tissue, then stood up, apparently preparing to leave.\n\nZhou Ze also stood up and followed her, like a loitering pervert.\n\nIt wasn’t that Zhou Ze was interested in her looks or anything; in this environment and state, Boss Zhou wouldn’t stoop to such a desperate level. Rather, it was because, in Zhou Ze's eyes, this girl was very different from everyone else in the restaurant.\n\nAlthough the other diners in the restaurant could eat, their movements actually felt no different from the headless family of three.\n\nNumbness,\n\nDead stillness,\n\nCarrying the aura of an old woman’s bound feet*.\n\nBut this girl had a kind of living aura about her. She seemed to have, just like him, a higher degree of… freedom in this environment than others.\n\nZhou Ze followed her out of the restaurant. To his surprise, he and she were walking down a glass corridor.\n\nIt was like a beehive, intricate and complex inside, with each bee having its own position.\n\nZhou Ze continued to follow behind the girl. The two walked slowly, one after the other.\n\nAs they walked, the girl stopped. She seemed to have only just noticed Zhou Ze.\n\nThe girl turned her head and smiled at Zhou Ze, a very pure smile.\n\n“Gua ni ji wa.” (Hello)\n\nThe girl bowed slightly to Zhou Ze.\n\nJapanese?\n\nZhou Ze’s first reaction was to think of his own Spider-Man.\n\n“Hello.”\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nZhou Ze still understood this simple Japanese, but he replied in Chinese.\n\n“Hello,” the girl replied again in Chinese.\n\nAfterward, the girl continued walking forward, and Zhou Ze continued to follow behind.\n\nThe recent interaction and greeting seemed more like an insignificant interlude, like a pebble dropped into a calm lake, quickly returning to tranquility after rippling.\n\nThey walked all the way to the lawn at the room's entrance, where Zhou Ze saw the girl turn in another direction.\n\nSo,\n\nShe was a neighbor.\n\nThe layout of this hot spring villa hotel was like this: a detached villa, split into two for use, with everyone sharing a single wall.\n\nTherefore, it was explained why the girl and Zhou Ze’s “walking” routes were the same. However, at this point, they had to part ways. Zhou Ze also tried walking in the girl’s direction but was directly blocked by a thin layer of glass.\n\nGiving up the struggle, Zhou Ze returned to his room.\n\nSitting down in the living room, he lit a cigarette. Zhou Ze then stood up again, walked to the picture frame, and looked. In the mirror, he was still lying on the sofa, Old Daoist was dozing off beside him, and Xu Qinglang was on the phone, seemingly contacting someone.\n\nZhou Ze guessed it was either Bai Yingying from the bookstore or Little Loli he was contacting. After all, his unresponsive state in reality, where he couldn't be woken no matter how much they called, was truly baffling and difficult for Old Xu and the others to handle.\n\nThis feeling of being cared for was quite nice. Of course, the feeling of peeking was also quite nice.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, flicked off some ash from his cigarette. Just then, the sound of water being let into the hot spring pool came from next door.\n\nThe yard was also divided into two, with a hot spring pool on each side. The sound of the running water was loud enough for the neighbors to hear.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the yard and sat down on a wicker chair.\n\nThere was nothing to be done about it. In the mirror world, you were lonely, like an incarcerated prisoner, only able to go to the dining hall at specific times along specific routes, then return to your cell.\n\nOf course, he could also peek through the mirror to see what Xu Qinglang and the others were doing in reality. But it wasn't like watching *that* kind of film where visuals without sound were fine. In this current situation, where he could only peek but couldn't communicate, he could only stand by and fret uselessly. It was truly boring and made him constantly irritable instead.\n\nNow he had a neighbor next door; listening to her movements was quite nice. Of course, if this neighbor were a burly, fat person, Zhou Ze probably wouldn't have much interest.\n\nThe water was quickly filled. Zhou Ze heard footsteps, and even the rustling sound of clothes being taken off.\n\nBeing able to only hear but not see was always a shortcoming. And on the grounds of not missing any clues, Boss Zhou simply moved the wicker chair under the wall and stood there himself.\n\nThere was also a thin layer of glass separating the top of the wall, preventing entry and exit, making it impossible to cross the forbidden line*. However, this couldn't stop him from looking. This thin layer of glass was more like a thin pixelation filter, which instead added a hazy beauty to the scene, making it more aesthetically pleasing—oh no, more *research-worthy*—than a simple, crude blockage.\n\nZhou Ze held a cigarette in one hand, gripping the wall with the other, peering inside.\n\nThe girl had already entered the hot spring pool, and then she began to sing, a lyrical Japanese song. Zhou Ze didn't understand the lyrics, but it felt good, quite pleasant to listen to.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze turned around, no longer looking inside, but leaning his back against the wall.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze heard a sense of loneliness in the girl’s singing; not the kind of loneliness that implies infidelity*, but the loneliness of being confined here for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze even thought that perhaps the other people in the restaurant, they too, at first, were like him, wanting to get out, wanting to question, wanting to do something, but slowly they were tortured into numbness by this day-after-day prison life, becoming like that family of three.\n\nHimself,\n\nWould he also have such a day?\n\n“Whoosh-whoosh…”\n\nThe girl finished her song and began to bathe, scrubbing herself with a bath towel. Zhou Ze could hear the sound of water, and even the girl’s breathing.\n\nBecause the distance was truly too close, the hot spring pools on both sides were actually built against the wall, so the girl and Zhou Ze were truly only a wall apart.\n\n“What’s your name?” Zhou Ze spoke.\n\nA peeping tom who had spied on someone bathing, spoke brazenly, asking for her name.\n\n“Tsukino Saori.”\n\nThe girl replied.\n\nShe had actually noticed Zhou Ze’s peeking a long time ago.\n\n“And you?” the girl asked.\n\n“Xu Qinglang.”\n\n“That’s a very nice name,” the girl said.\n\n“Mm,” Zhou Ze assented.\n\n“Did you also die near here?” the girl asked again.\n\n“Die?”\n\n“Yes, die.”\n\n“Are you already dead?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Haven’t you died yet?” the girl seemed a bit puzzled, then added, “Or perhaps, Mr. Xu, you haven’t realized that you’ve already been dead for a long time?”\n\n“I died a long, long time ago,” Zhou Ze replied. “Can you tell me how you died?”\n\n“I’d rather not answer that question,” the girl refused.\n\n“But I really want to know. Anyway, we don’t have anything else to do right now, do we?” Zhou Ze coaxed.\n\n“We can take a bath,” the girl said very seriously.\n\n“Take a bath?”\n\n“Yes, we can soak in the hot springs every day, take baths, and wash every single part of our bodies until they’re sparkling clean.\n\nPeople should be clean, no matter when, no matter the situation, they must be clean, and they absolutely have to be clean.”\n\nAs a man with mysophobia, Zhou Ze surprisingly felt some resonance in his heart upon hearing the girl’s words.\n\nThe girl truly stopped chatting with Zhou Ze. She began earnestly scrubbing her body, that is, cleaning herself.\n\nZhou Ze felt she was washing herself excessively clean. He could hear the forceful scrubbing of the bath towel on her skin crystal clear. It must, surely, hurt?\n\nA moment later,\n\nThe girl spoke up on her own initiative: “Mr. Xu, can you do me a favor?”\n\n“Speak.”\n\n“One of my legs,\n\nis in your pool over there,\n\nCan you help me,\n\nwash it clean?”\n\n————————\n\nA small earthquake occurred in Sichuan, causing the original route to be impassable, so we had to take a detour. This meant Long spent most of his time recently on the bus. Today, he visited and expressed condolences at two primary schools in Liangshan, then traveled by bus from afternoon until evening to reach the hotel. Consequently, this week’s updates can only be squeezed out of time, as it’s truly impossible to type on a laptop on bumpy mountain roads.\n\nThis is the first update; there will be a second one later.\n___\n**Footnotes:**\n*   **old woman’s bound feet:** Literally “old woman’s bound feet cloth,” an idiom often implying something drawn-out, stale, or unpleasant.\n*   **cross the forbidden line:** Literally “step across the Leichi pool,” an idiom meaning to overstep one’s bounds or cross a forbidden line.\n*   **implies infidelity:** Literally “red apricot tree leans over the wall,” an idiom implying a woman having an affair.",

    "content": "The bookstore was as desolate as ever. Of course, if the bookstore ever got lively, that would be a true haunting.\n\nAfter receiving a call from Xu Qinglang, Bai Yingying immediately changed her clothes. As she locked the store door, preparing to leave, she saw Spider-Man sitting alone inside, and she frowned slightly. Then she reopened the door and walked back in, saying to the silent Spider-Man:\n\n\"Hey, the boss has run into trouble. Come with me and help him.\"\n\nSpider-Man looked up at Bai Yingying, then quietly stood up. He only obeyed Zhou Ze, but that didn't mean he was completely without intelligence.\n\nAfter leading him out of the store, Bai Yingying locked the door. Just then, a taxi drove up, with Little Loli* sitting in the front passenger seat.\n\nOnce Bai Yingying and Spider-Man were in the car, the driver looked at his passengers, smiled, and said:\n\n\"What do you call yourselves again? Oh, cosplay enthusiasts, right?\"\n\nBai Yingying didn’t answer.\n\nLittle Loli didn’t answer.\n\nFather certainly couldn't answer.\n\nThe driver felt very awkward.\n\nThen he suddenly felt cold in the car. He looked down and saw the air conditioning wasn’t on.\n\n\"Let's go, driver, Mount General,\" Little Loli urged.\n\nShe was in a very bad mood right now because Zhou Ze was always causing trouble and getting into incidents. She only hoped that Zhou Ze could steadily build up performance to become a patrol inspector, and then she would be free.\n\nIn fact, she had always thought Zhou Ze was someone who knew his place, whether before or after she was subdued by him, Little Loli's opinion remained unchanged.\n\nBecause he was so lazy, no different from a salted fish†. But how could this very salted fish get into so much trouble?\n\nFirst, it was the Lord of the Underworld's certificate, then Lady Qingyi, followed by the Yin-Yang Scroll, then Father, and now he had gone to Mount General and gotten himself into a \"comatose\" state.\n\nLittle Loli took a deep breath. Dealing with such a constable was truly troublesome.\n\n\"Is there a way to solve the boss's problem?\" Bai Yingying asked Little Loli.\n\nLittle Loli smiled. \"I just received a call. That guy who runs a noodle shop is just an amateur in metaphysics. His description can hardly provide much valuable information. I have to go to the scene to draw a conclusion. But one thing is certain: someone like your boss, who can't even sleep without you or a freezer, how could he possibly be comatose? Especially when there are no external injuries on his body.\"\n\nBai Yingying frowned slightly upon hearing this, and said, \"No matter what, we have to wake the boss up.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" Little Loli pursed her lips.\n\n\"If the boss doesn't wake up, you'll be buried with him.\"\n\nLittle Loli's expression hardened upon hearing this. She said in a low voice, \"At a time like this, threatening me is pointless.\"\n\nThe driver listened to the little girl and the young woman bickering. Although he couldn't understand what they were talking about, he found it quite interesting. He wanted to chime in, but it seemed he wasn't part of the cosplay community, so it was hard to find common ground.\n\nHowever, the driver still found an opening. He said, \"Are you going to Mount General for tourism? I heard there was a murder case there recently.\"\n\nLittle Loli was silent.\n\nBai Yingying was silent.\n\nFather remained silent.\n\nThe driver felt even colder, so cold that he didn't want to drive anymore, and his feet were starting to tremble.\n\nThis was normal. The driver had hit the jackpot today, picking up three passengers: one underworld envoy, one zombie, and one corpse. How the hell could it not be cold?\n\nAn average taxi driver, courting death by driving to a funeral home or cemetery at night, would be thrilled to see a vague white shadow from afar. But he had just hit a grand slam.\n\nTaxi driver achieves peak ghost-sighting!\n\n\"Mount General, ah, a good place, ah. Do you know the origin of Mount General?\" The driver still wanted to talk; he couldn't *not* talk. He was so frozen, he exhaled misty breaths.\n\n\"What origin?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\nPerhaps because Bai Yingying initiated the conversation, she deliberately reined in her malevolent aura. The driver suddenly felt the temperature rise. This wasn't Bai Yingying's fault; she only \"ying ying ying\"‡ at Zhou Ze. When facing others, she was truly icy cold. Especially after the boss got into trouble, Yingying wasn't in a good mood either.\n\n\"Cao Ding, do you know him?\" the driver asked.\n\n\"Who is that?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"A famous general who resisted Japanese pirates. Of course, he couldn't compare to Qi Jiguang, but he was very formidable. He was a local from our Tongcheng. During the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, weren't the Japanese pirates causing a lot of trouble? Our Tongcheng is near the Yangtze River estuary, so many Japanese pirates came here. He led troops to repel them several times, but he died heroically in battle at the age of forty-four.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Bai Yingying nodded.\n\nLittle Loli, however, suddenly became interested. She asked, \"What's the connection between Mount General and Cao Ding?\"\n\n\"It was named after him! There's also a scenic spot on Mount General called Wazi Tomb. It's for commemorating him. At that time, the Japanese pirates rampaged, burning and looting. Cao Ding defeated them, and then, while pursuing the Japanese pirates to Mount General, an accident occurred, and he died a heroic death. Originally, Mount General wasn't called that, and Cao Ding's official rank wasn't high, but our Tongcheng people remembered him fondly, so they called that mountain Mount General, and it hasn't changed since.\"\n\nLittle Loli licked her lips, lost in thought.\n\nAbout an hour later, the car finally arrived at the foot of Mount General. Little Loli paid and got out first.\n\nWhen Bai Yingying got out, she saw Little Loli standing with her hands behind her back, looking up towards the mountaintop, appearing like a miniature adult.\n\n\"See anything?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"The problem is I didn't see anything,\" Little Loli said, frowning. \"This is the strangest thing, because that guy named Xu said they saw ghosts, quite a few of them, in the hot spring hotel on the mountaintop. But here, it's calm and peaceful, not a single trace of ominous energy. I think your boss must have the same confusion as me: there are clearly ghosts, yet it's calm and peaceful.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear what the driver said earlier? This is a place where heroic souls sacrificed themselves, enjoying generations of incense offerings from the local people. In this place, even if evil spirits appear, they will be heavily suppressed. Even you and I will feel some suppression.\"\n\n\"Then the boss, he...?\"\n\n\"It shouldn't be that bad. Although your boss is a ghost, he wouldn't be directly targeted. Besides, five hundred years have passed since the Jiajing reign. Even the most powerful heroic souls couldn't last this long. People are always forgetful.\"\n\n\"Let's go to the hotel first and see what's wrong with the boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying said, then walked directly up the mountain.\n\nLittle Loli followed behind.\n\nFather walked last.\n\nHowever, as they walked,\n\nFather suddenly stopped. His formerly hunched body slowly straightened up, and a faint green light emerged from the hood around his eyes.\n\nLittle Loli tilted her head, looked at Father, and asked with some concern, \"He won't lose control, will he?\"\n\nBai Yingying shook her head very firmly. \"Impossible. He's not the same as before. You're not a zombie, so you don't understand how we zombies feel. I can tell you with certainty that he will absolutely never betray the boss in this life.\"\n\nFather's gaze scanned around, as if searching for something, or as if something was calling out to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Bai Yingying and Little Loli sensed nothing at all.\n\n\"Is there something?\" Bai Yingying asked Father.\n\nFather seemed bewildered, his hands spread open, as if he didn't know how to describe it. He hadn't said a word since Zhou Ze brought him back to the bookstore.\n\nWhen he communicated with Zhou Ze, it was simple, but when communicating with others, it was very difficult.\n\n\"What exactly is it?\" Bai Yingying pressed.\n\nFather remained bewildered, but he mechanically bent down and picked up two stones, one large and one small.\n\nThe small stone was stacked on top of the large stone.\n\nThen,\n\nFather reached out and gripped the small stone on top.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nThe small stone instantly shattered.\n\nThe fragments slowly slipped from Father's fingertips.\n\nThen, he looked at Bai Yingying and Little Loli, as if checking if they understood.\n\n\"Oh...!\"\n\nLittle Loli opened her mouth and made a sound.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Bai Yingying looked at Little Loli.\n\n\"Oh... I don't understand either.\" Little Loli.\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying.\n\nFather reached up and scratched his head.\n\nHe seemed to be thinking about how to express himself.\n\n\"Never mind. Let's find your boss first.\"\n\nLittle Loli didn't want to waste any more time. She turned and walked uphill. Bai Yingying glanced at Father and followed along.\n\nFather bewilderedly continued to follow behind them.\n\nFather walked very steadily, but with every step, he left a footprint. At the same time, he unconsciously shook his head, like a cow swatting away an annoying fly.\n\n***\n\n\"Hey, I cleaned this leg for you. Not bad, legs you could play with for a year§.\"\n\nZhou Ze held the girl's leg and wiggled it towards the wall.\n\nEarlier, the Old Taoist had fished a leg out of the water in the hot spring illusion. It was precisely this leg that Zhou Ze was now holding.\n\n\"Do you want to play?\" the girl from the next compartment asked.\n\n\"Sorry, I was just making a joke. After all, we're all dead, so no joke is off-limits.\"\n\n\"I asked you... do you want to play?\"\n\nThe woman pressed on.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the severed leg in his hand and refused.\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze refused,\n\nScalding, boiling blood began to surge out of Zhou Ze's hot spring pool. It wasn't hot spring water, but blood.\n\nThe blood quickly filled the hot spring pool, like a boiling Chengdu hotpot, piping hot and scalding.\n\nMoreover,\n\nThere was actually something in it that seemed to be boiling, constantly churning.\n\nIt was another leg.\n\nIt was an arm.\n\nIt was a torso.\n\nIt was a neck.\n\nDismembered body parts were constantly churning within.\n\nShe came.\n\nShe leaped over the glass partition.\n\nFrom the next compartment, she came to Zhou Ze!\n\nIn the blood, her head slowly floated up. All her limbs and body parts continued to churn around her.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nShe opened her mouth and said:\n\n\"Not playing?\"\n\n---\n*   **Little Loli:** A nickname for a young girl character, often implying cuteness or a specific aesthetic.\n†   **Salted fish:** An idiom describing someone who is lazy, unmotivated, and just \"lies there\" doing nothing.\n‡   **\"Ying ying ying\":** An onomatopoeia for a soft, pleading, or cutesy sound, indicating a gentle, docile, or affectionate demeanor, usually directed towards a specific person.\n§   **\"Legs you could play with for a year\":** An internet slang term praising exceptionally beautiful or attractive legs, implying they are worthy of long-term admiration.",

    "content": "「Not playing?\"\n\nFacing the girl's questioning, Zhou Ze was somewhat speechless. Such matters required mutual consent, or a clean transaction. He'd never heard of forced buying and selling.\n\nYou're amazing,\nYou can cross boundaries,\nYou can come from next door into my yard,\nBut no matter how amazing you are,\nEven if we assume the worst,\nIn your current state, torn to pieces, even if I were just being prissy and refusing before, I couldn't bring myself to want it now.\n\nBoss Zhou stroked his forehead, feeling a little heartbroken.\n\nBut the girl was clearly filled with immense rage. At this very moment, the bloody water in the hot spring pool actually overflowed, and simultaneously, the girl's previously severed body parts slowly reassembled themselves.\n\nAlright,\nThe body's reassembled,\nIt's usable now.\nIs that what you mean?\nAren't they all the same with the lights off?\nIsn't the most common thing said \"You're lying on my hair?\"\nChinese parents would educate their children from a young age that picky eating was wrong, and they should think more about how many peasant uncles in ancient times toiled in the fields only to end up too poor to marry and remained bachelors.^1\n\nBoss Zhou wanted to follow his heart. If giving in could solve the problem before him, it was best not to resort to violence. After all, from the woman's perspective, she had taken such initiative. For a man to evade it, regardless of the reason, would always be scorned.\n\nBut looking at the reassembled girl, the original severed and reattached parts of her body had distinct raised bloodstains, and all around were dense, crimson patterns, like an embroidered silk painting by Li Kui^2. It was truly a gruesome sight, purely giving off the impression of a patched-together doll.\n\nI'm sorry,\nI refuse.\n\nZhou Ze stood his ground, watching the girl approach him step by step. His fingernails slowly extended.\n\nThen,\nThe woman approached him,\nThe surrounding blood surged towards Zhou Ze like boiling water, creating quite a spectacle.\n\nZhou Ze spread his arms, his nails sweeping to both sides. The blood parted instantly, and the girl's body was simultaneously split in half. The poor girl, like a piece of clay, had just managed to reassemble herself, only to be brutally torn apart by Zhou Ze.^3\n\nCan't deal with this glass, but can I not deal with you?\n\nThe girl, split into two halves, began to writhe, as if about to rejoin.\n\nZhou Ze wasted no words, his nails continued to slice down, cutting the girl apart again as if dicing vegetables. Adhering to the principle of not being *that* much of a beast, Zhou Ze picked up the girl's two halves of her head and turned to walk directly into the living room.\n\nPerhaps,\nThe girl was also shocked.\nSuch a stunning entrance, such a sharp declaration,\nOnly to end up,\nAs if she were a dish delivered right to the door,\nTruly sliced up by Zhou Ze.\n\nThe girl's head was placed on the coffee table by Zhou Ze. He lit a cigarette. Frankly, with Zhou Ze's current strength and status, dealing with a mere female ghost could no longer provide him with any sense of satisfaction.\n\nBut there were some questions Zhou Ze needed to ask her, most importantly,\nHow he was supposed to get out of this damned mirror world.\n\nAfter the girl's two halves of her head were put together, they slowly began to fuse. Outside the living room, her body also started to coalesce again. The headless body wandered restlessly outside the living room, as if wanting to come in but hesitant.\n\nOnce the girl's head was restored, it sat squarely on the coffee table, continuing to glare at Zhou Ze, but the anger in her gaze had significantly diminished, replaced instead by a sense of trepidation.\n\nAs the saying goes, those who are pitiful must have something hateful about them. Ghosts are no different.\n\nBoss Zhou had seen countless ghosts and heard many different ghost stories. He had more or less guessed something about the girl's experiences before her death.\n\nRaped,\nAnd dismembered,\nFinally trapped here, becoming a lost soul in a mirror. That should be about right.\n\nShe desperately scrubbed her body, hoping to gain some psychological suggestion and comfort from the act, to make herself feel that her body was still clean.\n\nA pitiful Japanese girl.\nSuch pity knows no borders.\n\nBut ghosts are products of such extreme circumstances. In fact, overly nonchalant people don't qualify to linger in the human world as ghosts. Those who were salted fish^4 and Buddhist^5 their whole lives and then died are all obediently queuing up and walking forward on the road to the Underworld.\n\nFrom a Ghost Messenger's perspective, ghosts able to linger in the human world are basically troublemakers, the kind of disobedient kids in class who like to talk back to the teacher.\n\nSo, when the girl took her anger out on him, reasoning with her wouldn't work; she wouldn't listen at all.\n\nThe last time he encountered the vengeful sea python, and in many other incidents, Zhou Ze had indeed met quite a few \"wronged and aggrieved\" departed souls. But if Zhou Ze didn't have his nails and wasn't a Ghost Messenger, he might not even have the qualification to pity them, only becoming a sacrifice to their wrath.\n\n\"They, weren't released by me. In fact, I don't even know why I was pulled into this place.\"\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring at the girl, and continued:\n\n\"I told you, I can help you get revenge, provided you tell me the secrets of this place, and how to leave this damned place.\"\n\nThe girl continued to stare at Zhou Ze with hateful eyes. Zhou Ze didn't pay her much mind and kept smoking.\n\nJust wait.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the woman's headless body outside slowly sat down. She hugged her knees, leaning against the floor-to-ceiling window outside the living room, looking very lonely and desolate.\n\nAnd in the girl's eyes, the furious gleam was gone, replaced by a stream of tears.\n\nZhou Ze pulled out a tissue from the coffee table, wiped her face, and simultaneously comforted her:\n\n\"Don't cry. You'll ruin your pretty face if you cry.\nI, Xu Qinglang,\nWould feel heartbroken.\"\n\nSo, when you go out to do something unspeakable, it's very necessary to give your good friend's name.\n\nFor instance, when peeking at a girl bathing,\nOr when you've just sliced a girl up like a vegetable, yet you hypocritically go and wipe her tears,\nOr when, after finishing the \"Ice Water Tenderness\" project at a club^6, the technician hands you a form to write a review and leave your signature,\nIn these situations,\nLeaving your own name is very unwise.\n\n\"They... have already left.\" The girl choked out.\n\n\"How many people?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Three, three people.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Then how did they die?\"\n\nIf the girl was murdered by those three, then how did these three people die?\nIt couldn't possibly be that the murdered girl immediately turned into a vengeful ghost and successfully got her revenge, could it?\nIf she had successfully exacted revenge, she wouldn't still harbor such immense resentment.\n\n\"They were chosen by the devil.\" A flicker of confusion appeared in the girl's eyes. \"They were chosen by the devil...\"\n\n\"You can be more specific. We're not writing poetry.\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"It's the devil, it's the devil, it's the devil!!!\"\n\n\"Fine, it's the devil, it's the devil.\" Zhou Ze felt a bit helpless. \"Anything else? It's best if you tell me everything in detail, from when the incident happened to everything you encountered afterwards.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached into his pocket, pulled out his Ghost Messenger's Badge, and waved it in front of the girl.\n\n\"You can think of me as a police officer.\"\n\nThe girl's gaze began to wander around.\n\nZhou Ze also looked around, asking, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"This place is shrouded by mirrors, and mirrors don't just reflect the present; they can also remember the past.\"\n\n\"How do you see it?\"\n\nTears continued to fall from the corners of the girl's eyes, but this time, the falling tears began to evaporate in mid-air before reaching the ground, creating a hazy, colorful halo. Even the surrounding glass reflected an unusual glow.\n\nThis was like the feeling of sitting in a movie theater; everything around them seemed to be re-covered by a layer of white dust, tainted with an unreal haziness.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze most was that he could even hear sounds. The mirrors here recorded more than just simple images.\n\nOn the sofa in front of Zhou Ze sat a man with a short, flat top haircut, under thirty years old, smoking a cigarette with his feet propped on the coffee table.\n\nThis was an image, recording what had happened in the past.\n\nWith a \"clang,\"\nThe door was heavily shut.\nTwo more men walked in. These two looked younger, perhaps around twenty-five or twenty-six. They held two large plastic bags. One wore a baseball cap, while the other had long hair, giving off an artistic vibe.\n\nBaseball Cap and Long Hair sat down opposite Short Flat Top, both placing their items beside them.\n\nBaseball Cap pointed at Short Flat Top, who was silently puffing on a cigarette across from them, and laughed to Long Hair beside him:\n\n\"What did I say earlier? His home team lost today. He's definitely in a bad mood, mad all by himself, ha ha ha...\"\n\n\"Laugh your ass off, laugh, laugh, all you do is laugh!\nWe could've won against Jiangsu today, damn it!\nTheir Jinling^7 home ground was just cursed today. We hit the post a few times, and they just swung their leg any old way and scored. It's infuriating.\"\n\nShort Flat Top directly cursed at Baseball Cap, clearly in a very bad mood.\n\n\"It's just a team losing a game, what's the big deal? Real Madrid and Barcelona lose games too, don't they?\"\n\nBaseball Cap said dismissively. Then, he opened his bag. \"Come on, let's start our party. I brought the drinks too.\"\n\nInside the bag were clothes. Baseball Cap took them out and handed a set to Short Flat Top.\n\nShort Flat Top took the clothes, and all three began to change.\n\nThese three sets of clothes were Japanese military uniforms. Having been immersed in various anti-Japanese war films, the Chinese public was more than familiar with this attire.\n\nShort Flat Top adjusted his collar, looked at himself in the mirror, and seemed very satisfied. Then, as if something occurred to him, he said directly:\n\n\"Damn it, you guys, tell me,\nIf the Japanese had killed more people in Jinling back then, killed all those idiots, wouldn't my team have won today?\nIt would be best if everyone in Jinling was killed off. Then that place wouldn't have a team anymore, and I wouldn't be in such a bad mood today. I was supposed to be happy celebrating with you guys.\"\n\nThe long-haired man nodded:\n\n\"Exactly. If those American devils hadn't been so insidious back then, we would already be Japanese citizens by now. Instead, we're still stuck with these Zhina^8 bastards.\nJust thinking about going to school with them before and now having to work with them, it makes me sick.\"\n---\n^1: This is a common lecture given by Chinese parents to encourage children not to be picky eaters, using historical hardship as an example.\n^2: Li Kui is a famous, boisterous, and powerful character from the classical Chinese novel \"Water Margin\" (水浒传).

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood on the side, as if watching a stage play, the actors engrossed in their roles, completely oblivious to whether an audience was watching their performance.\n\nIn fact, they were indeed very self-absorbed.\n\nMusic started playing; it was a Japanese song with a strong rhythm.\n\nThen these three people, wearing Japanese military uniforms, started dancing, wielding replica samurai swords likely custom-made from Taobao, spinning around while humming along to the beat, like celebrating and cosplaying.\n\n\"What song is this?\" Zhou Ze asked the girl's head beside him, as Zhou Ze really didn't understand much Japanese.\n\n\"'Battōtai', it's a type of Japanese Army military song,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"Oh, I thought it was an Ultraman theme song.\"\n\nThe three guys were having a blast; it was clear they were completely immersed in it, quite self-forgetful.\n\nActually, it looked quite idiotic; these three guys were not Japanese but genuine Chinese, which could be discerned from their accents and what they said earlier.\n\nYet now they were so focused and invested, as if performing some lofty ritual, making one inevitably think of the idiom \"mù hóu ér guàn\"*.\n\nLiking their comics, action films, songs, movie stars, etc. — these were all fine and normal. Even having a good impression of any country was everyone's freedom, but the words and deeds of these three guys clearly went beyond that feeling.\n\nEspecially because of the outcome of a ball game, to say words wishing the Japanese had been more thorough with the Nanjing Massacre back then was an unforgivable crime.\n\nThat contempt for their own identity and yearning for another country's identity made Zhou Ze uncomfortable, because he had experienced Sansan Village, where the villagers, even after death, still endured immense hunger and pain, yet still fiercely guarded the \"military rations.\"\n\nThe actions of the dead and the living formed an extremely stark contrast.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze heard a woman's voice asking a question in Japanese.\n\nThe voice sounded a bit familiar.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the girl's head.\n\n\"At that time... I thought the people living next door were also Japanese, so I... took the initiative to greet them,\" the girl said through gritted teeth.\n\n\"Tsk, tsk.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"So she willingly walked into their trap?\"\n\nThe three men dancing and marching immediately stopped after hearing the woman next door greet them in Japanese, then walked out to the living room to talk to her. They couldn't speak Japanese, which was laughable; they desperately wanted to be Japanese but hadn't even learned the language.\n\nBut in the end, when the long-haired man went to open the door, the girl was standing at the doorway.\n\nFor the girl, it was very likely a feeling of meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land; after all, being in a foreign country, if your compatriot was next door, there would always be an uncontrollable urge to get close.\n\nThe girl was invited by them to join the party; she even performed a Japanese song. Although the three men didn't understand Japanese, they completely embodied the expression \"bù míng jué lì\"*.\n\nAfterwards, everyone started drinking.\n\nThen, the man with the buzz cut first started making advances. The girl had been drinking, but she was still somewhat sober; she immediately stood up and refused, then said in Chinese that she was going back to her room.\n\nAs the story progressed to this point, Zhou Ze turned his head and asked the girl's head, \"You must have realized they weren't Japanese long ago, right?\"\n\n\"I thought they admired Japanese culture, so I...\"\n\nHearing this explanation, Zhou Ze found it quite interesting; when he fought with the priest back then, the priest had even mocked how Chinese people most liked hearing foreigners speak Chinese to gain immense inner satisfaction from it.\n\nThe subsequent plot was simple: the girl resisted, the men forced themselves on her, and all three forced themselves on her. Because all three were drunk, the final scene was a mix of the girl's whimpers and struggles after her mouth was gagged with a towel.\n\nAfter it was over, the girl lay on the ground, her eyes unfocused, her body twisted, while the three men were like the Japanese soldiers of that era who would be issued comfort women coupons periodically, done after releasing their urges.\n\nDuring that period, the Japanese set up many comfort stations in areas where their troops were stationed, forcing women from various countries inside to be brutalized. In Japanese military camps, this was like a recreational activity, like watching movies, where the number of movie tickets issued each month varied depending on rank.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze narrowed his eyes; it seemed the main act was about to begin.\n\nThe girl was ultimately dismembered.\n\nDid these three men want to silence her?\n\nBut even if they wanted to silence her, they shouldn't have gone to such extremes as dismembering her, right?\n\nBecause the reason was simple: dismembering and disposing of a body in a hotel, it would be hard not to leave traces. If they just wanted to eradicate the root, there was no need at all to do it this way.\n\nZhou Ze continued watching from the side; anyway, the answer would be revealed soon.\n\nThe three men seemed to sober up, looking at the Japanese girl lying almost comatose on the ground, fear appeared on their faces too.\n\nIn fact, it was true; generally speaking, people who liked to engage in regional attacks or were extreme Japanophiles online were actually quite cowardly in real life, usually insignificant minor characters, which was why they desperately hoped to gain another kind of distorted satisfaction for their failed lives elsewhere.\n\nThese three people were clearly flustered; the long-haired man even ran over and apologized profusely, hoping to get the girl's forgiveness and prevent her from calling the police.\n\nThe other man with the buzz cut and the man with the baseball cap were also somewhat panicked.\n\nBut just then, on the floor beneath their feet, three shadows suddenly appeared. These three shadows appeared very eerily, with no warning at all before, then silently merged with the shadows of the three men, becoming one.\n\nAnd in the eyes of these three men, a hint of bloody light slowly emerged.\n\nNext was the most brutal and horrifying scene.\n\nThe girl was dismembered; her body was placed like a sacrifice at the edge of the hot spring pool, and the three men actually knelt facing the hot spring pool.\n\nThey began chanting some spell, or perhaps reciting some prayer, this time, using very pure Japanese pronunciation.\n\nPossessed!\n\nAnd \"the magpie's nest was occupied by a dove\"*!\n\nAs someone who had returned from the dead by \"borrowing a corpse to revive a soul\"*, Zhou Ze was actually very familiar with this scene.\n\nThe girl's head, upon hearing the words spoken by these three men, showed great pain. Her headless body ran from the courtyard into the living room, reaching up to cover its ears.\n\nThis posture was strange.\n\nThe headless corpse stood on the side, covering its ears with its hands, while its head was placed on the coffee table.\n\nIt could be imagined that this sound of Japanese chanting was a great torment and torture for the girl.\n\nWhoosh...\n\nThe surrounding scene began to distort.\n\nAnd then gradually dissipated.\n\nZhou Ze only remembered that last scene: it was a ritual, as if to summon something. The bodies of the three men were slowly desiccated into husks, finally turning into pus, seeping into the pebbles in the courtyard. The girl's body was also like this, completely dissolving in the hot spring pool, like food boiled until melted.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze walked in front of the girl and asked, \"When did you die?\"\n\n\"A year ago,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"You've been here since you died?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"Yes, I've been here since I died, and they were next door to me. I couldn't leave. All I could do was see the activities of subsequent guests who moved in, through the mirror. Later, I noticed more and more people in the restaurant; some dead people nearby, their spirits would approach and stay here, and dine in the restaurant punctually.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you seek revenge on them before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Because I couldn't go there before, now I can, because they're gone, something is about to awaken.\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, then continued, \"What exactly is that thing?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I really don't know,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"Then one last question for you, did a family of three, parents with a girl about five years old, stay here recently?\"\n\n\"Yes, they stayed here.\" The girl looked at Zhou Ze, a little lost, and said, \"When they stayed here, I heard those three men say that this family of three was the best sacrifice.\n\nThen, a few days later, I saw that family of three dining in the restaurant; they... no longer had heads.\"\n\n\"Were they killed by those three men? But they're already dead, aren't they? Without physical bodies, just like you, sealed in the mirror, they shouldn't be able to get out, right?\n\nAlso,\n\nwhat did those three men want their heads for?\"\n\n\"It should be to awaken themselves,\" the girl replied. \"I've heard many of their conversations; they were all conversing in Japanese. They yearned to regain their freedom, yearned to escape from someone's suppression.\"\n\n\"Suppression?\"\n\n\"Yes, they are different from me. Those three are different from the other spirits who later gathered here. They have greater freedom; they could even enter my room at any time if they wished, but they weren't interested in that. They were always waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a suitable opportunity.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the sofa.\n\nThis case, which originally involved a family of three being silenced, now involved far too many things.\n\nThe incident originated a year ago.\n\nThree idiotic extreme Japanophiles held a party here, then attracted a Japanese girl traveling in China from next door. Then these three extreme Japanophiles became aroused; after all, they who dreamed of being Japanese truly couldn't refuse a Japanese girl who offered herself.\n\nPerhaps when they \"committed the act,\" their evil thoughts were perceived, or perhaps their previous act of wearing Japanese military uniforms and singing Japanese songs produced an effect similar to a \"pen spirit\"* ritual.\n\nIn short, three Japanese ghosts originally suppressed here by some unknown entity were summoned, then possessed their bodies, and at the same time, this poor Japanese girl was dismembered and sacrificed by her own countrymen.\n\nThose three extreme Japanophiles also died; this was their first step toward freedom, changing from a suppressed state to spirits sealed in the mirror. Seemingly still confined and locked away, but they should have gained more freedom than before.\n\nThey must have been waiting for the next round of sacrifices to appear, which was that family of three. So, that family of three must have suffered at their hands, allowing them to gain further freedom.\n\nWhat made Zhou Ze somewhat angry was that he was the key for those three Japanese ghosts to gain even further freedom.\n\nThat ghostly phone call* attracted him here and then made him take the place of those three guys in \"prison,\" allowing them to gain \"complete freedom\"!\n\nHe was clearly the hunter, yet he was trapped by those who should have been his prey, and he walked right into it.\n\nBut where exactly did these three Japanese ghosts come from?\n\nZhou Ze could sense that those three spirits, whether in terms of their capabilities or methods, were not comparable to ordinary spirits. This wasn't Zhou Ze trying to justify why he fell into a trap, but because of the ritualistic methods, even Zhou Ze, a ghost postman, wouldn't know how to do them. Zhou Ze even believed that Little Loli, that senior ghost postman, probably wouldn't either.\n\nThree spirits, more professional than ghost postmen?\n\n\"Oh, right,\" the girl seemed to suddenly remember something and said, \"During this past year, I often heard them cursing a person. I don't know who that person is, but it's probably strongly related to their suppression.\"\n\n\"What's that person's name?\" Zhou Ze looked up and asked.\n\n\"Cao Ding.\"\n___\n*1: Literally \"monkey wearing a hat,\" it refers to someone who is dressed up or in a position of authority but lacks the true qualities or understanding for that role, often implying a superficial or ridiculous display.\n*2: A popular internet slang term, literally \"don't understand, but feel awesome,\" used to express admiration for something incomprehensible but impressive.\n*3: Literally \"a magpie's nest occupied by a dove,\" this idiom means to usurp someone else's place or possessions, often implying a forceful or cunning takeover.\n*4: Literally \"to borrow a corpse and return the soul,\" this idiom refers to a soul taking over a dead body to be reborn, or, more broadly, to reappear in a different form or under a new guise.\n*5: Literally \"pen spirit,\" this refers to a Chinese divination game similar to an Ouija board, involving a suspended pen that moves seemingly on its own to answer questions.\n*6: Literally \"ghost incoming call,\" often referring to a supernatural phone call that lures someone into a dangerous situation.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze knew who Cao Ding was. After all, the little loli was a latecomer, having possessed the body of little Wang Rui. Zhou Ze didn't know where she was originally from or when she died, nor was he bothered to ask, but he estimated she wasn't local.\n\nAs for Bai Yingying, she was a naive and innocent girl who had been lying in a coffin for two hundred years. Normally, her chats with Madam Bai were just casual gossip between girlfriends. Have you ever seen a girlfriend get-together where they promote patriotism?\n\nSo, neither of these two were truly native Tongcheng people. But Zhou Ze, having lived two lives, had always been a Tongcheng person. Cao Ding was quite famous in Tongcheng. Of course, the most famous person in Tongcheng was Zhang Jian, who had drafted the Qing Emperor's abdication edict. After him, if you counted and calculated, Cao Ding could also rank in the top ten.\n\nA hero against the Wokou (Japanese pirates), though his official rank and fame didn't seem very high. Zhou Ze only knew this much; he had long forgotten the specifics. He only knew Cao Ding was a figure from the mid-Ming Dynasty, a time when the Wokou were at their most rampant. Along the coast, the Wokou were a rampant scourge, and the official army was ineffective, often collapsing at the first encounter with the Wokou. It was only later, after generals like Qi Jiguang gradually rose to prominence, that the Wokou disturbances slowly subsided.\n\nIn other words, for a long period, the Ming Dynasty official army was basically at a \"combat power of five\" level<sup>1</sup>. It was a bit like the early days of the Anti-Japanese War in later generations, when the Japanese army came in full force, almost irresistible. Therefore, generals who dared to go against the current at that time were often the most valuable, because at that time there was almost no hope of winning, which is why it truly embodied \"even if there are a thousand enemies, I will go forth\"<sup>2</sup>.\n\nSince those three Japanese ghosts hated Cao Ding, Zhou Ze could only boldly speculate: could the identities of those three ghosts also have been \"cellared\" for five hundred years<sup>3</sup>?\n\nThis speculation was quite terrifying, making Zhou Ze unable to help but ponder it carefully.\n\nMost importantly, the heroic spirit had suppressed these ghost brats here for so many years. Don't let it turn out that he fell into a trap and ended up releasing them instead. Then his sin would be immense. What if those three scoundrels, once released, caused more trouble in Tongcheng or the surrounding area? Would all this karma eventually fall on his head?\n\nBoss Zhou never denied being a \"salted fish\"<sup>4</sup> afraid of trouble. Normally, his mentality for getting by was truly \"better one less thing than one more.\" But he really wouldn't accidentally open Pandora's Box and then just shake his hands and go back to sleep.\n\n\"How do we get out?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked the most crucial question. Of course, Zhou Ze actually knew that the Japanese girl in front of him probably didn't know how to get out either.\n\nThis place was like a special container. Zhou Ze guessed it was likely due to the unique environment of General Mountain. Cao Ding's heroic spirit had suppressed these Wokou for five hundred years. It was originally a top-level prison, but the Wokou's spirits had started playing \"prison break\" like *The Count of Monte Cristo*.\n\nIt wasn't an immediate breakout, but rather a gradual increase in their freedom. It was akin to slowly moving themselves from the innermost, most heavily guarded cells to the outermost, most loosely guarded cells of the prison.\n\nThis was somewhat like a compromise, which was why this strange, nondescript place had been created. In this mirror world, the spirits couldn't significantly interfere with the outside world; this was already the final layer of restraint.\n\nThe Japanese girl shook her head. By now, she had already placed her head back on her neck.\n\nShe didn't know how to get out. If she had, she would have gone out for revenge long ago; why wait until now?\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit helpless. He took out his phone, which still had no signal. But Zhou Ze thought of something: those three Japanese ghosts had been able to call him from here, playing a \"ghost call.\" Could he do the same?\n\nHe tried to dial Xu Qinglang's number. The phone kept ringing on the other end; it actually connected.\n\nZhou Ze, pleasantly surprised, walked over to the picture frame, looking at Xu Qinglang's situation inside.\n\nHis phone kept ringing, and he could hear \"Doo... doo...\" sounds from the other side. But in his eyes, Xu Qinglang had no intention of answering the phone at all.\n\nIt connected, but there was no response from the other side?\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hear the sounds from inside, nor did he know if Xu Qinglang's phone was actually ringing. But it was highly probable that the phone on the other side wasn't reacting.\n\nZhou Ze then tried calling Bai Yingying and the little loli. The calls all connected, but no one answered on the other end.\n\n………………\n\nWhile Zhou Ze was trying to make calls, Bai Yingying, the little loli, and the others had already entered the hotel and knocked on the door from outside.\n\nIt was Xu Qinglang who opened the door, his face looking somewhat haggard. He looked exactly like a wife exhausted from caring for her bedridden husband.\n\nThis was indeed the case. He remembered that night, Xu Qinglang was still sleeping. Then Old Tao let out a scream and directly urinated blood, and after that, Zhou Ze lay unconscious on the ground. From that moment until now, Xu Qinglang had been like an ant on a hot pan, never having a moment of peace.\n\nBai Yingying immediately found the unconscious Boss lying on the sofa. She knelt directly by the sofa, reached out and held Boss's hand, continuously calling for him to wake up quickly and not abandon Yingying.\n\nEveryone around subconsciously twitched their mouths upon seeing this scene.\n\n\"Come on,\"\n\n\"Zhou Ze isn't even dead yet,\"\n\n\"You're being a bit too dramatic, exactly like a concubine from an ancient prominent family, who, after mourning, would pack up her valuables and prepare to flee.\"\n\nThe little loli, on the other hand, seemed much calmer. From her perspective, she seemed to care more about whether Zhou Ze was conscious or not right now. If he was consciously comatose, then her life was still in his hands; but if he was completely unconscious,\n\n\"Then wouldn't she be free if she killed him now?\"\n\nOf course, the little loli was only thinking it, just like men walking on the street might subconsciously fantasize a bit when they see women of varying figures. She wouldn't dare to do it, nor would she dare to gamble on it.\n\nFinally, the little loli walked over to Zhou Ze's side and began to examine his condition.\n\nOld Tao, standing by, began to recount in detail everything that had happened in the past few days again.\n\n\"How is he?\" Bai Yingying asked the little loli.\n\n\"His soul is still there,\" the little loli said with a frown, \"but it's not complete.\"\n\n\"Not complete?\"\n\nThe little loli scanned her surroundings, seemingly searching for something.\n\n\"Yes, it's not complete, which is why he can't wake up.\"\n\nOld Tao, hearing this from the side, said, \"I seem to remember a villain in *Investiture of the Gods* who had a magical artifact that could take away parts of people's souls.\"\n\nThe little loli ignored Old Tao's words and had no time to discuss *Investiture of the Gods* with him. She began to walk around the room, especially after seeing the shattered glass on the bathroom floor, her gaze turned more towards reflective objects.\n\nIn fact, finally, the little loli even stood in front of the \"Eight Steeds\" painting frame in the living room, looking into the mirror-like frame.\n\n…………\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, the little loli seemed to be staring directly at him. But she shouldn't be able to see inside, which already demonstrated the little loli's superior level and insight compared to those around her.\n\n\"Can she see you?\" the Japanese girl beside him asked.\n\n\"Given enough time, she should be able to figure it out.\" Zhou Ze continued to look at his phone. The awkward problem now was, even if the little loli was given more time, and even if she could confirm he was in the mirror,\n\nhow was he supposed to get out?\n\nThere definitely had to be a way out, Zhou Ze believed. It was like facing a complex game, but you needed enough time to play through it. At the very least, you needed countless experiences of failure and exploration. However, Zhou Ze didn't have that much time right now. Those three Japanese ghosts had been here for a year, and most importantly, they might have been playing this game for five hundred years!\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe sound of glass shattering came from outside the door.\n\nThe Japanese girl looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"It's mealtime.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Aren't you going?\" the Japanese girl continued to ask.\n\n\"Are you very hungry? Or, can you get hungry?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Just want to go out for a walk.\"\n\nZhou Ze understood. For those in the mirror world, eating a meal was like prisoners in a cell being let out for some fresh air and outdoor activity at scheduled times.\n\n\"I'm not inter......\"\n\nBefore Zhou Ze could finish his sentence,\n\nFrom outside, the sounds of \"Crack... crack... crack...\" suddenly continued.\n\nZhou Ze immediately rushed to the door and opened it.\n\nYes,\n\nOriginally, outside there should have only been a glass corridor leading directly to the restaurant. But now, the surrounding glass began shattering one after another. More and more spirits began wandering around aimlessly and dispersedly. They seemed to have lost their original restraints and became disoriented.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked the Japanese girl behind him.\n\n\"I don't know either.\" The Japanese girl also showed a surprised expression.\n\nZhou Ze rushed out the door. All around, glass was continuing to shatter, from far to near. This gave Zhou Ze a very ominous premonition. He was currently a prisoner held here, and the glass could be understood as the iron bars of a prison. The iron bars were now constantly shattering and disappearing, which for prisoners was actually a very good thing, as they would regain their freedom.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze, it was different. Because this meant that the restrictions and restraints here were fading away. What had been suppressed all along was now seizing the opportunity to escape.\n\nThe number of spirits here began to increase. Due to the unique nature of General Mountain, the spirits of those who died nearby would subconsciously gather here. It was somewhat like a \"treasure basin\"<sup>5</sup>.\n\nAnd now, this group of people began to move forward aimlessly, as if receiving some kind of guidance.\n\nZhou Ze walked among the crowd, urgently wanting to know the source of all this.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze saw a flag ahead.\n\nAnd beneath the flag,\n\nlay three sets of black Japanese samurai armor. The armor bore numerous scars and damaged spots, yet exuded a unique grimness.\n\nThe flag emitted black light, enveloping a circle. Any spirits drawn over would, upon entering this circle, be bound by black threads. And those three sets of armor, which had been neatly stacked and motionless,\n\nInside,\n\nbegan to slowly swell...\n\n——————\n\nSorry, last night I returned to the hotel after an interview and originally set an alarm to sleep for two hours and then get up to write. But the alarm didn't wake the dragon<sup>6</sup>, and I ended up sleeping straight until early morning the next day...\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> Combat power of five: An internet slang term originating from the anime *Dragon Ball*, used to describe someone or something as extremely weak or useless.\n<sup>2</sup> Even if there are a thousand enemies, I will go forth: A classical Chinese idiom from Mencius (孟子), meaning to possess courage and determination to face overwhelming odds without fear.\n<sup>3</sup> Cellared for five hundred years: A humorous and literal translation of 窖藏 (jiàocáng), usually referring to wine or other goods stored in a cellar for a long period, here implying the ghosts have been preserved for centuries.\n<sup>4</sup> Salted fish: An idiom (鹹魚) often used to describe someone who is lazy, unmotivated, or content with a mediocre, unambitious life.\n<sup>5</sup> Treasure basin: A mythical basin (聚寶盆) in Chinese folklore believed to endlessly generate wealth or treasures; here used to describe a place where spirits naturally accumulate.\n<sup>6</sup> The dragon: The author's humorous self-reference.",

    "content": "\"It's getting windy outside.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest walked to the living room's French window and closed it. For some reason, the wind had suddenly intensified, rustling the trees and wicker chairs in the yard.\n\nThe little loli, meanwhile, shifted her gaze from the Eight Steeds Painting, and even proactively walked over to open the doors and windows the old Taoist priest had just closed. She peered outside, then returned with an extremely grave expression.\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze, who was still unconscious on the sofa, a glint of killing intent flashed in the little loli's eyes.\n\n\"What are you doing!\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately snapped.\n\nThe little loli pointed at Zhou Ze, cursing directly, \"What on earth did this bastard release? He's trying to get me killed!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nSuddenly, the door was blown open by the wind outside, and even the French window's glass shattered directly. Broken glass shards splattered everywhere in the living room.\n\nThe old Taoist priest and Xu Qinglang immediately crouched down, covering their heads with their clothes for protection. Bai Yingying threw herself over Zhou Ze to shield her boss. The glass shards that flew at Bai Yingying were all directly bounced away; the female zombie's physique was indeed formidable.\n\nThe little loli stood amidst the showering glass shards. Honestly, she looked quite stylish; combined with her aloof loli expression, it truly felt like a blockbuster movie scene.\n\nSpider-Man, who had been sitting on a chair ever since he entered, seemed to be accustomed to this manner. Normally, after cleaning the rooms in the bookstore, he would also find a spot to sit and then remain motionless. Even the old Taoist priest, who was easily excitable, couldn't provoke him, only feeling that this guy was less entertaining than his own monkey.\n\nAt this moment, the little loli stared directly at Spider-Man.\n\nSpider-Man continued to sit, seemingly unfazed by the little loli's gaze.\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath and said directly, \"Let's deal with the problem here first.\"\n\nSpider-Man remained motionless.\n\nBack when guests came to the bookstore, seeing him sitting there motionless, they even thought he was a sculpture, like the models placed in movie theaters when Spider-Man movies are about to be screened.\n\n\"I've always been curious why you stayed in Tongcheng. That guy's ashes, that was just an accidental discovery, wasn't it? It wasn't the real reason you've been in Tongcheng for such a long time.\"\n\nSpider-Man remained unmoved.\n\n\"I've investigated. This hot spring resort hotel on General's Mountain is Xu family property.\"\n\nNo matter how vast the world, this is China after all. Tongcheng is a second-tier city, but in reality, it's just a small place. After all, across the river is the Magic City*, so there aren't many foreigners in Tongcheng. Citizens still look curiously at foreigners they see on the street, unlike residents of big cities who are long accustomed to blonde hair, blue eyes, or dark skin.\n\nThe little loli knew that Zhou Ze had first met the priest at a funeral. At that time, the priest stood beside several women from the Xu family, somewhat like a family pastor.\n\nAnd General's Mountain was Xu family property again,\n\nAnd now, the group of Wokou†亡魂 (departed souls/ghosts) suppressed by the brave souls were, inexplicably, about to riot. Could this be a coincidence?\n\nSpider-Man remained as steady as Mount Tai.\n\nThe wind grew stronger, carrying a howling shriek. To ordinary people, this would just be a sudden change in weather, signaling rain. But even Xu Qinglang could see that the wind carried a dense malevolent aura—a sign of a great evil emerging!\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath.\n\nShe was so angry!\n\nWhy was it always Zhou Ze causing trouble, and she had to desperately clean up his mess?\n\nFurthermore, this time the little loli had to clean up the mess whether she wanted to or not, because she was also a Ghost Catcher‡ in Tongcheng. This meant she was responsible for handling all supernatural incidents within Tongcheng's jurisdiction. If a supernatural incident affected too many innocent people and caused chaos, then she would bear direct responsibility.\n\nThis was like disaster striking from the heavens while sitting at home. The little loli suddenly felt very wronged. It seemed she hadn't had a single comfortable day since meeting this slacker§.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nThe hot spring pool began to bubble. The tap wasn't open; the water was flowing backward from the drainage plug at the bottom. Then, the entire courtyard began to collapse. The cobblestone ground directly caved in, and even more than half of the living room followed, sinking down.\n\nBai Yingying, quick as a flash, hoisted her boss onto her back and dodged backward, preventing him from rolling down with the collapse.\n\nInside the resort, a pit had appeared. At the bottom of this pit was a dilapidated plaque, riddled with bullet holes.\n\nIt was said that when the devils** advanced into Tongcheng, they learned there was a Wako†† tomb and a General's Temple here, so they specifically came to destroy them. The bullet holes on the plaque were likely left from that time.\n\nThis clearly indicated it had been deliberately moved here. At the same time, the entire resort could even be described as a \"clumsy cover-up\" specifically built for this purpose.\n\nBelow the plaque was a headless statue. Its paint had long since deteriorated, depicting a man on horseback holding a blade, conveying a sense of desolation.\n\nBeside the male statue were three boxes, largely rotted away. From within, it was clear that they contained something resembling armor.\n\n\"Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nA series of vibrating sounds emanated from the boxes below. Immediately after, a dark shadow suddenly shot out and plunged directly into one of the boxes. Then, the rotted box instantly burst apart, and a set of armor slowly propped itself up, reaching a man's height. However, the armor was floating; no one was wearing it.\n\n\"Oh...\"\n\nA weathered voice issued from within the armor,\n\nas if someone awakened from a very long slumber,\n\n\"Hai...\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA rusted katana appeared from an unknown nook below and instantly embedded itself in the warrior's hand.\n\nThe warrior first looked at the other two sets of armor at his feet, seemingly puzzled as to why his two companions hadn't awakened with him. Then, he looked at the statue behind him.\n\nFive hundred years ago, it was this very person who stopped them. But five hundred years later,\n\nIt's time to end this!\n\nThe little loli's gaze sharpened. She opened her mouth, and her tongue shot out rapidly, transforming into a whip that lashed fiercely at the warrior.\n\nAs if having eyes in his back, the warrior's katana slashed across, blocking the tongue. At the same time, his body flickered, pulling the little loli backward by her tongue.\n\nThe little loli was pulled airborne as if she were a kite, but she clung on tightly, refusing to let go. She knew that the stone statue could not be allowed to collapse, otherwise the remaining two would also be released, and they would be even more unrestrained.\n\nOne might ask, why didn't they just destroy the statue earlier?\n\nBut in reality, if the statue had been destroyed earlier, it would have destroyed all three of them along with it, like digging up the roots of a fruit before it's ripe.\n\n\"Baka...\"\n\nThe warrior's blade slashed down horizontally. The little loli's body trembled, and she instinctively retracted her tongue, but her entire being also leaped into the pit. She had no choice; she had to stop them, and she had to face them head-on.\n\nBai Yingying also regained her senses at this moment and shouted to the old Taoist priest, \"Protect the boss!\"\n\nImmediately after, she looked at Spider-Man sitting nearby. \"Come with me!\" Then, Bai Yingying leaped directly into the pit. Spider-Man, who had shown no reaction to the little loli's cold words earlier, immediately stood up and jumped down with her.\n\nThe old Taoist priest looked at Xu Qinglang and said, \"I'll protect the boss. You go too.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Xu Qinglang took out his heart-protecting mirror‡‡. He hadn't even jumped down yet when the little loli flew out backward, slamming heavily into Xu Qinglang, sending him tumbling backward with her.\n\nThe little loli quickly got up, a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth. But she immediately flipped her tongue, licked the blood back into her mouth, and then rushed back in.\n\nNext was Bai Yingying. Bai Yingying was directly struck by the katana. Although no substantial damage was dealt, the ghostly energy from the blade directly dispersed the malevolent aura around her, causing Bai Yingying to stagger backward continuously.\n\nSpider-Man, however, continued to trade blows with the warrior, who kept uttering sounds of surprise and suspicion;\n\nEvidently, he knew the priest, but he couldn't understand why this junior of his own kind would suddenly turn against him.\n\n............\n\nZhou Ze didn't know how critical the situation was in reality. He didn't have time now to return to the room and observe the outside through the glass mirror.\n\nRight now, he was amidst a flow of people, watching more and more departed souls enter the circle around the flag, being herded in like individual batteries.\n\nBetween the flag and the armor, three figures in Japanese military uniforms, holding katanas, ran in circles while continuously singing Japanese military songs.\n\nThey were already dead, yet they hadn't realized their demise. They still believed they were alive, dreaming the delusion of having become Japanese.\n\nTheir actions were, in fact, attracting nearby departed souls to continuously approach.\n\nIn fact, behind the flag, a massive phantom could vaguely be seen. Within the phantom was a man on horseback, looking very majestic, but his shadow was constantly twisting and blurring.\n\n\"What is this, a suppressed demon?\" the Japanese girl asked, finding Zhou Ze and standing beside him.\n\nShe, on the other hand, didn't feel that the warriors were her own kind. After all, her being dismembered and offered as a sacrifice back then was thanks to these three sets of armor before them.\n\nIn her eyes, these things were not her kinsmen, but utter demons.\n\n\"Yes.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why were these demons able to break free?\" the Japanese girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the three figures in Japanese military uniforms still jumping around incessantly,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Because those who unsealed them are Chinese.\"\n___\n*The \"Magic City\" (魔都) is a common nickname for Shanghai.\n†Wokou (倭寇) refers to Japanese pirates who raided the coastlines of China and Korea.\n‡A \"Ghost Catcher\" (鬼差) is an official of the underworld responsible for apprehending and managing spirits.\n§Literally \"salted fish\", a slang term for someone who is unmotivated, inactive, or gives up on life.\n**Derogatory term for Japanese soldiers, often translated as \"devils.\"\n††A \"Wako tomb\" (倭子坟) refers to a tomb of Japanese pirates (Wako).\n‡‡A \"heart-protecting mirror\" (护心镜) is typically a small, round mirror worn on the chest, often for protection against evil spirits or for spiritual cultivation.",

    "content": "Actually, the samurai's combat strength wasn't that high. Of course, his footwork and experience were indeed rich, so he often gained the upper hand in skirmishes, but the damage caused by his attacks was not very severe.\n\nLittle Loli could confidently maneuver around him. Bai Yingying, relying on her sturdy physique, could endure the damage after each hit and quickly charge back into battle. Spider-Man also managed to fight back and forth.\n\nHowever, the most crucial point was that a soldier wearing armor—armor was merely a soldier's defensive gear, serving only to mitigate some damage. In fact, there were ways to bypass the armor or even attack the soldier directly through it.\n\nOnly,\n\nthe samurai before them,\n\nhe had no flesh and blood,\n\nno presence. He was like a mass of air supporting this black samurai armor in battle. Therefore, Bai Yingying and their attacks could only land on the armor, and the effect was, in fact, negligible.\n\nUnless they could instantly tear or shatter the armor, but this armor, even five hundred years ago, shouldn't have been an ordinary item. After five hundred years of nourishment, it had long surpassed the usual toughness of armor. To directly smash it was simply too difficult, too difficult.\n\nBecause of this, even though the samurai was currently fighting one against three, he still didn't show any disadvantage.\n\n\"Seal him!\"\n\nLittle Loli shouted at Bai Yingying and Spider-Man. For now, they could only settle for the next best thing, because if she hadn't been intentionally blocking him from behind, the samurai might have long since found an opportunity to destroy Cao Ding's sculpture.\n\nOne was already this tough to crack. If two more appeared, the situation here would be completely reversed.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, then charged forward again. This time, Spider-Man coordinated with Bai Yingying, moving at the same speed but from different directions to outflank him.\n\nThe katana was flipped, its tip directly stabbing into Spider-Man's thigh, then quickly cutting upward horizontally. The whole process was smooth and decisive.\n\nA gash was almost carved open on Spider-Man's body. He began to retreat, finally slumping onto the ground. Spider-Man's clothes were also cut open and scattered on the ground. From the wound, foul-smelling pus continuously oozed out, a truly startling sight.\n\nBai Yingying's gaze hardened. For some reason, she noticed that the samurai's strength seemed to have suddenly increased compared to when they first engaged!\n\nThis feeling was quickly verified.\n\n\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\"\n\nThe samurai exchanged three blows with Bai Yingying. He stood firm, while Bai Yingying began to retreat continuously. In the next moment, the samurai appeared behind Bai Yingying, moving extraordinarily fast, followed by a horizontal slash.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe blade emitted a piercing scraping sound upon contact with Bai Yingying. Bai Yingying was sent flying, and the malevolent aura around her continuously dissipated. After falling, Bai Yingying couldn't get up as quickly as before. She could only lie on the ground, struggling to support her body with her hands, looking very distressed.\n\nBeneath the helmet, a pair of crimson eyes seemed to be watching everything. Then, the samurai continued to accelerate, charging directly towards Little Loli's position ahead.\n\nLittle Loli was in an awkward spot. She could dodge, but behind her was Cao Ding's sculpture. She detested the feeling of having no retreat, as not everyone had the courage or willingness to be a hero.\n\nBut at this moment, she still spread her arms, stood on her tiptoes, and after extending her tongue, a black vortex swept out.\n\n\"Swish! Swish! Swish!\"\n\nWith each slash of the katana, Little Loli's body would tremble delicately once, but she still didn't retreat.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nshe suddenly discovered, to her astonishment, that the samurai's strength was like a roller coaster. At first, it was flat, then suddenly surged, instantly defeating Spider-Man and Bai Yingying. But at this moment, his strength seemed to have fallen back down.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth without End, Profound Heart Righteous Law!\"\n\nSeizing this opportunity, Xu Qinglang appeared, holding his heart-protecting mirror. He knew that with his strength, it would be difficult to play a significant role in a direct confrontation, so he simply chose to strike at the opportune moment.\n\nIt must be said, the timing Xu Qinglang chose was truly excellent.\n\nThe heart-protecting mirror directly adhered to the armor, causing the samurai's body to tremble as if electrocuted. But then, the katana suddenly turned sideways on its own, targeting Xu Qinglang.\n\nEven though Xu Qinglang had been prepared beforehand, and quickly retreated after his attack landed, he was still swept by the blade's aura, his body arcing gracefully through the air as he flew directly out of the pit. Fortunately, he landed on a sofa when he fell, otherwise, he might have been directly killed by the fall.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately crawled over to check on Xu Qinglang. Seeing him unconscious, he immediately slapped Xu Qinglang's face.\n\n\"I'm not dead............\" Xu Qinglang said with difficulty.\n\n\"Damn it, this guy is really tough to crack. So many of you couldn't beat him.\"\n\nThe old Taoist peered down, seeing Little Loli still locked in a stalemate with the samurai. Once Little Loli was defeated, this round would truly be over.\n\n\"You... go down and help...\"\n\nXu Qinglang lowered his head and glanced at his abdomen. A wound had appeared there. It was truly a close call; if he had retreated just a little later, he might have been cut in half.\n\n\"Don't talk, you shouldn't talk much with your injuries,\" the old Taoist said very seriously.\n\nXu Qinglang, while using one hand to staunch his wound to prevent too much blood loss, used his other hand to firmly grasp the old Taoist's arm, glaring at him.\n\nThe old Taoist felt very uneasy under his stare,\n\nMMP, ah,<sup>[1]</sup>\n\nYou guys don't know my level,\n\nYou want me to go up?\n\nThe old Taoist truly didn't want to go up.\n\n\"Can you invite spirits?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Uh, I used to dabble in it, but that was just to fool people.\" At this moment, the old Taoist didn't mind exposing his own shortcomings.\n\nXu Qinglang took out a very small talisman paper from his shirt pocket, much, much smaller than the old Taoist's talisman papers.\n\n\"Stick it on your forehead and try inviting a spirit to possess you!\"\n\n\"Will it work?\" The old Taoist was clearly skeptical.\n\nSimple tools, simple operation, simple procedure,\n\nInviting spirits is that easy?\n\nThen do those swindlers on the street still need to deceive people?\n\n\"The Yin energy is heavy here now, and there are many ghosts. Just inviting any one to possess you will at least make you stronger than you are now!\"\n\nAfter saying these words, Xu Qinglang coughed heavily a few times, spitting out several mouthfuls of blood.\n\nThe old Taoist opened his mouth, seemingly hesitating. The old Taoist was afraid of death, truly afraid of death. And such a simple method of inviting spirits—to put it nicely, it was inviting spirits; to put it bluntly, it was actually just letting a random minor ghost nearby possess one's body to stimulate one's potential, and the side effects would definitely be terrifying.\n\nBut just then, the old Taoist clearly saw Little Loli suddenly drop to one knee over there, blood overflowing from the corner of her mouth. Clearly, she was also about to give out.\n\nWhat the old Taoist understood even more clearly was that once Little Loli was defeated, whether or not the samurai broke the sculpture, their side would already be finished.\n\nThe most capable boss,\n\nwas precisely still in a deep sleep!\n\nThe old Taoist immediately felt a sense of \"the wind soughs and the Yishui River flows cold,\"<sup>[2]</sup> but he still stuck the talisman paper Xu Qinglang handed him onto his forehead.\n\n\"Great Immortal, please possess me!\"\n\nThe old Taoist didn't know how to recite Taoist incantations for inviting spirits. Instead, he started jumping up and down like a shaman performing a Northeast folk ritual, looking very comical.\n\nSuddenly, the old Taoist's body trembled, then he propped himself up with his hands on his knees, his upper body slumping forward.\n\nXu Qinglang, struggling to hold his abdominal wound, looked at the old Taoist with hopeful eyes. At present, there was no other choice. Having the old Taoist invite a minor ghost for possession was an act of desperation. An additional combatant, no matter how small, was still an additional combatant, as even a mosquito's leg is still meat.<sup>[3]</sup>\n\nThat talisman wasn't a proper spirit-invitation talisman either. It was actually the key reason Xu Qinglang was able to enter Three Villages back then. The talisman's purpose was to suppress the Yang energy in a living person and obscure the three lights on their body,<sup>[4]</sup> making it easier for ghosts to enter.\n\nThe old Taoist slowly raised his head, his gaze falling on Xu Qinglang lying on the ground, then he gave a bitter laugh:\n\n\"Damn it, it's useless, ah. Is this humble Taoist's Yang energy too strong?\"\n\nXu Qinglang turned his head away dejectedly. He despaired.\n\nThe talisman paper remained stuck to the old Taoist's head. He had just exhausted himself by jumping around. His hand unconsciously reached into his pants, feeling around, but unfortunately, the talisman he had was already used up.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nA roar from the soul emanated from within the samurai's armor,\n\nand then the samurai disregarded Little Loli's attacks, forcibly enduring everything. With a downward slash, Little Loli raised both hands and clamped onto the katana. Simultaneously, her tongue directly pierced through the samurai's armor, but the samurai also fiercely kicked Little Loli's body.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nLittle Loli was sent flying backward,\n\nand crashed heavily onto the ground.\n\nThe samurai armor was severely damaged and continued to crack. Clearly, it was also nearing its limit, but he still struggled to charge towards Cao Ding's sculpture.\n\n\"It's over!\"\n\nThe old Taoist slapped his thigh. At this moment, his scoundrelly aura<sup>[5]</sup> became apparent. He directly picked up a broken concrete brick from nearby, jumped down, and charged towards the samurai.\n\nThe old Taoist was going all out; he had no choice but to go all out.\n\nThe feeling at this moment was like a siege battle where the regular army had all died, and only the old, weak, women, and children were left to continue fighting.\n\nIt must be said,\n\nthe old Taoist's self-assessment was very accurate.\n\nAlthough the samurai was severely wounded by Little Loli, a centipede dies but never falls stiff.<sup>[6]</sup> The next moment, as he turned around, he thrust his katana horizontally. The old Taoist's body trembled with fright.\n\nBut as quickly as it was said, the talisman paper stuck to the old Taoist's forehead suddenly broke off. Simultaneously, the old Taoist's entire demeanor abruptly changed. He immediately shifted his body, dodging the slash. At the same time, the old Taoist's palm pressed down along the back of the katana, causing the blade to stab into the ground with its momentum. The old Taoist himself boldly closed in on the samurai, his shoulder smashing fiercely into the samurai's helmet.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA crisp thud,\n\nThe samurai's armor was once again extensively damaged. His body swayed continuously as he began to retreat, like a plastic toy about to fall completely apart.\n\nBut the samurai paid no attention to his injuries. That pair of crimson eyes, with a special glow, stared fixedly at the old Taoist.\n\nWithin that gaze, there was wariness and solemnity,\n\nand even,\n\nsomething called fear.\n\nThe old Taoist pulled the katana from the ground, skillfully twirled it, then raised the blade, pointing it at the samurai. From his mouth, in a hoarse yet remarkably resonant voice, he uttered two words:\n\n\"Kill the Wokou!\"<sup>[7]</sup>\n\n---\n<sup>[1]</sup> **MMP, ah**: An internet slang abbreviation of a vulgar Chinese phrase, often used to express strong frustration or anger.\n<sup>[2]</sup> **\"the wind soughs and the Yishui River flows cold\"**: A famous line from a poem by Jing Ke, a legendary assassin, as he departed to assassinate the King of Qin. It implies a tragic, resolute, and desperate farewell.\n<sup>[3]</sup> **\"even a mosquito's leg is still meat\"**: A Chinese idiom meaning that even a very small amount of something is still better than nothing at all; every little bit helps.\n<sup>[4]</sup> **three lights**: In Chinese folklore and Taoist belief, a living person has three spiritual \"lights\" or \"flames\" (on the head and shoulders) that protect them from ghosts. Suppressing these lights makes one vulnerable to spiritual possession.\n<sup>[5]</sup> **scoundrelly aura**: Lit. \"bachelor's aura,\" referring to a reckless, devil-may-care attitude, often associated with someone without family burdens or a tendency to act shamelessly.\n<sup>[6]</sup> **a centipede dies but never falls stiff**: A Chinese idiom meaning that even a severely weakened large entity retains some power and is hard to completely destroy.\n<sup>[7]</sup> **Wokou**: A term historically used in China and Korea to refer to Japanese pirates and raiders who plundered coastal areas from the 13th to the 16th centuries. It carries a strong negative and nationalistic connotation.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze did not choose to enter the area encompassed by the flag without permission, because he was unsure if the flag would also have a special effect on him;\n\nHowever, not entering there didn't mean there was no way at all.\n\nAt this moment, Boss Zhou stood outside the circle, waving his nails, intimidating the attracted spirits, preventing them from daring to step into the flag's range.\n\nThese three sets of armor had awakened and were operating by relying on the baleful aura provided by the entry of these spirits; cutting off the spirits' entry was akin to drawing firewood from under the cauldron.footnote:[Drawing firewood from under the cauldron (釜底抽薪 - fǔ dǐ chōu xīn) is an idiom meaning to remove the root cause of a problem, or to cut off an enemy's lifeline/supply at the source.]\n\nThe Japanese girl stood by Zhou Ze's side, her eyes red, various parts of her body beginning to twist, emitting her own aura to help Zhou Ze intimidate these spirits.\n\nIn fact, most of the spirits here could only be called 'spirits', not even 'ghosts', because they were originally destined for hell, but after death, they were 'detained' by General's Mountain's special magnetic field environment and gathered here.\n\nHowever, the Japanese girl was a genuine ghost, with a deep obsession for revenge, and thus, she was able to maintain her own lucidity in this environment.\n\nShe didn't have other thoughts because it was a Japanese setup; for her, her promising life had been ruined by her 'compatriots,' and all she wanted to do now was take revenge!\n\nZhou Ze actually felt quite idiotic, like an adult holding a knife and intimidating a bunch of kindergarten children not to move; it was a very uncouth thing to do, but it was the only thing Zhou Ze could do at the moment.\n\nZhou Ze dared not take risks; if he charged directly in and was affected by that eerie flag, things would truly get troublesome.\n\nOne had to know that he was different from these spirits; if they were individual batteries, then he was a nuclear power plant.\n\nZhou Ze also tried to open the Gate of Hell to take away all these spirits, but presumably because they were in the mirror world, the Gate of Hell couldn't be opened. However, Zhou Ze could at least be clear about one thing: the outside world must be in chaos now, and he didn't know if Bai Yingying and Little Lolita could hold out.\n\nIn fact, had it not been for Zhou Ze's timely intervention, causing one of the awakened armors to lose its continuous source of baleful aura, the situation outside might have already extremely deteriorated.\n\nAnd the previous roller-coaster change in the samurai's power was precisely due to this reason.\n\nWhile keeping an eye on the bewildered spirits in front who instinctively wanted to come here, Zhou Ze also paid attention to the situation behind him. He found that the hovering black armor was already largely damaged, and he breathed a sigh of relief, guessing that the situation outside shouldn't be completely out of control, right?\n\nHowever, at this moment, the three men who had previously been wearing Japanese military uniforms, singing and dancing around the flagpole, helping to attract spirits, together raised the knives in their hands and charged towards Zhou Ze, shouting something.\n\nZhou Ze didn't care about the knives in their hands. When the first person charged over, he directly backhanded, pinching the opponent's knife hilt with his nails, and then lifted it. Due to the momentum of his charge, the opponent willingly fell towards Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze directly clasped the opponent's neck, his five nails ruthlessly piercing into his neck!\n\n\"Wanting to be a Jap* has driven you insane, hasn't it?\" Zhou Ze said in a deep voice.\nfootnote:[Jap (鬼子 - guǐzi) is a derogatory term for Japanese people, especially soldiers.]\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe man let out a miserable scream; at this moment, he seemed to gain a moment of lucidity because of it.\n\nThe basic instinct for 'survival' at play, at this moment, he actually looked at Zhou Ze and pleaded:\n\n\"I'm not Japanese, I'm Chinese, I'm Chinese…………\"\n\nZhou Ze showed no politeness whatsoever, directly twisting his neck, while the black mist on his nails transformed into the sharpest 'blades,' instantly pulverizing his spirit!\n\nTo deal with such scum, there was no need to show any mercy; having their souls scattered and never being reborn was their rightful destination.\n\nHowever, perhaps Zhou Ze's simple and brutal killing of one of their companions instilled immense fear in the other two. They dared not continue forward, dared not leave the area demarcated by the flag, and instead, directly walked in front of the two still-unawakened armors and began putting them on.\n\n…………\n\nThe Old Taoist held a samurai sword,\n\nHis legs slightly spread, in an out-toeing stance,\n\nOriginally, he actually had a quite handsome appearance, carrying an aura of a Taoist immortal, but now, his body exuded a sense of simplicity and unpretentiousness.\n\nOne man,\n\nOne sword,\n\nFive hundred years ago, when Japanese pirates ran rampant in Tongcheng, the defending soldiers scattered, and the garrison troops were useless. He had many times gone against the current, actively heading towards the areas where the Japanese pirates were causing trouble.\n\nAt forty-four years old, already aged (people in ancient times aged faster and had shorter lifespans), upon hearing the alarm, he still unhesitatingly mounted his horse, grabbed his sword, and actively charged forward. That battle is meticulously recorded in the Tongcheng local gazetteer; he charged in and out three times, leading the local Tongcheng villagers to repel the Japanese pirates, and then died in pursuit.\n\nThere are many sculptures of Cao Ding in Tongcheng. If one observes closely, they can notice that Cao Ding's sculptures are missing two fingers from his left hand.\n\nThe reason was that upon hearing of the Japanese pirates' invasion, Cao Ding began sharpening his sword, personally testing the sharpness of the blade with his fingers. As a result, two of his fingers were directly severed. Cao Ding laughed loudly, mounted his horse with his sword, and rode off to kill the Japanese*.\nfootnote:[Japanese (倭 - Wō) is a term often used historically in a derogatory sense, particularly in relation to the Japanese pirates.]\n\nAt that time, Cao Ding had already left the army; his identity then was merely the owner of a noodle shop in Tongcheng.\n\nThe Old Taoist had never felt so exhilarated!\n\nFirst-person perspective!\n\nFirst-person sensation!\n\nFirst-person audience!\n\nAlthough his body was not under his own control, clearly being controlled by an external will, the Old Taoist felt very satisfied.\n\nThe only regret was perhaps that no one had the time to take out a phone and record a video for him as a keepsake,\n\nIt's not easy to find a chance to show off!\n\nCao Ding didn't say much, which displeased the Old Taoist. \"Say more, give me more flashes! Forget about sand flying and stones rolling or a blood moon piercing through the clouds in an instant, at least help me make this grandstanding more perfect, right?\"\n\nOf course, these were just the Old Taoist's inner grumblings.\n\nHowever, in reality, before Cao Ding died in battle, all he did was bandage his finger wound and shout out one phrase:\n\n\"Kill the Japanese*.\"\nfootnote:[Kill the Japanese (殺倭 - shā Wō) uses a derogatory term for Japanese people.]\n\nUntil his death, he said nothing else, but he used his entire life, even dedicating his next five hundred years, to practicing these two words.\n\nThe Old Taoist walked directly over. The samurai began to retreat, but in the next moment, the Old Taoist accelerated. Heaven knows the Old Taoist could run so fast.\n\nThe samurai, left with no choice, actively engaged. His aura had already weakened significantly, because he knew he was facing not just this Old Taoist, but an existence that had instilled fear in him for five hundred years.\n\nOne strike,\n\nJust one strike,\n\nWithout any fancy moves,\n\nWithout the slightest hesitation,\n\nEverything seemed so effortless, revealing a relaxed ease that felt surprising, even a little unsatisfying.\n\nThe samurai's helmet was pierced through, directly shattering. Along with it, the armor, which had long been on the verge of breaking, also fragmented.\n\nThis strike was merely the final push to send the samurai over the cliff; Bai Yingying, Xu Qinglang, and Little Lolita had already basically worn this samurai down to a spent force.\n\nOnly,\n\nThis was not yet over.\n\nThe armor that had been quietly placed in the rotten box now slowly began to fill out, as if someone had put them on.\n\nThe Old Taoist continued walking towards them, still moving very quickly.\n\nThere are Japanese pirates,\n\nJust kill them,\n\nNo need for further words.\n\nThe two newly appeared samurai seemed not to have fully adapted to the situation yet, but they instinctively sensed danger. One samurai immediately raised his samurai sword and chopped down at the Old Taoist.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nSword clashed against sword,\n\nThe Old Taoist's knees gave out, and he directly knelt on one knee.\n\nThe Old Taoist felt a blush of shame in his heart; he knew it was his old arms and legs, not strong enough for the heroic spirit to exert its power, making him feel a bit like a hindrance.\n\nBut at the moment of kneeling, the samurai sword in the Old Taoist's hand, with an extremely fluid motion, lifted upwards from below!\n\n\"Pffft…………\"\n\nThe blade energy deeply pierced the armor, leaving an incredibly profound mark there.\n\nThe Old Taoist slapped the ground with one palm, quickly stood up, then bent his arm, thrusting the blade forward from behind, while simultaneously, his shoulder and thigh actively slammed hard into the samurai, forcing the samurai to lose balance for that moment.\n\n\"Screech…………\"\n\nA grating friction sound rang out,\n\nThe samurai sword in the Old Taoist's hand was already pressed against the samurai's neck; of course, samurai did not have necks, but the blade's edge was against the spot slightly below his helmet.\n\nWith utmost ease,\n\nHe had control of the situation!\n\nHowever, at this moment, a face appeared from beneath the helmet, a twisted, panicked face. At the same time, this face roared:\n\n\"I'm Chinese, I'm Chinese, I'm not Japanese, I'm not a Japanese pirate, not a Japanese pirate, I'm Chinese! Don't kill me, please don't kill me, I'm Chinese!!!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist felt extremely anxious!\n\nUnfortunately, the Old Taoist did not have the power to control his own body, at least not at this moment.\n\nGenerally speaking, in the Old Taoist's view, such heroic figures often possessed high moral standards. He genuinely worried that Cao Ding, bearing the idea of not harming his own compatriots due to the Chinese soul within the opponent, might hesitate or let the opponent go.\n\nIn reality, the Old Taoist had already sensed that the consciousness controlling his body was growing weaker and weaker, and might have to leave at any moment!\n\n\"At this time, there could be no hesitation, and certainly no soft-heartedness!\"\n\n\"Brother,\n\nBig brother,\n\nOld senior,\n\nDon't talk about principles, absolutely don't talk about principles! Cut him down, cut him down!'\"\n\nFortunately,\n\nThe Old Taoist's worries were unnecessary, truly, incredibly unnecessary,\n\nThe moment the opponent revealed his Chinese identity and pleaded,\n\nThe blade directly went in,\n\nDirectly shattering the armor's helmet.\n\nIncredibly satisfying,\n\nUtterly simple and brutal,\n\nThat person's plea and lamentation truly had not the slightest effect.\n\nSo fast that the Old Taoist felt a bit unaccustomed.\n\nCao Ding glanced at the broken armor at his feet that had turned into a pile,\n\nAnd said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Most of the Japanese pirates* back then were also our own people.\"\nfootnote:[Japanese pirates (倭寇 - Wōkòu) refers to pirates who raided the coasts of China and Korea, primarily between the 13th and 16th centuries. While some were Japanese, many were Chinese who collaborated with them.]\n\n…………\n\nPS: According to the *Veritable Records of Emperor Jiajing*: \"Of the maritime alarms in Jiangnan, Japanese constituted three-tenths, while Chinese rebels constituted seven-tenths.\"",

    "content": "其實，並不是說老道被附身之後就一下子打通了任督二脈然後神功大漲可以神擋殺神佛擋殺佛了，曹頂的上身確實激發出了老道的潛能，但實際上再怎麼激發，老道的潛能也不可能激發到超過白鶯鶯和小蘿莉的層次。\n\n\n\n  之所以能夠砍瓜切菜一樣連續解決倆武士，實際上是因為曹頂當年殺了他們，同時還鎮壓了他們五百年，這是一種烙印在靈魂深處的恐懼。\n\n\n\n  在曹頂的面前，這三名兇悍殺人如麻的武士，只能淪為瘦弱的鵪鶉。\n\n\n\n  這就像是白鶯鶯一個人時會很高冷，但在面對血統壓制自己的周老闆時馬上就變成「嚶嚶嚶」一個道理。\n\n\n\n  曹頂很爽脆，直接殺死了第二名武士，現在，只剩下一個了。\n\n\n\n  而且可以看出來，這名武士明顯有些惶惶不安，這種恐懼真的不是喊一句「人定勝天」這種口號就能抵抗得了的。\n\n\n\n  這是天敵，是難以逾越的鴻溝。\n\n\n\n  老道心下長舒一口氣，現在只要把最後一個殺了，自己這個逼也就能裝結束了。\n\n\n\n  曹頂也沒有耽擱時間，他也清楚自己耽擱不起，是故直接沖了上去。\n\n\n\n  老道身形矯健，宛若煥發了第二春，那名武士開始躲避，甚至不敢去主動反擊，但躲避也起不到太大的效果，在十餘招之後，武士開始不支，終於被曹頂找到了一個漏洞一腳踹中跪伏了下來，緊接著，曹頂的刀口順勢橫亘了上去。 \n\n\n\n  快，\n\n\n\n  砍了他，\n\n\n\n  砍了他！\n\n\n\n  砍了他，我們就可以喊「咔」，然後回家吃飯收衣服了！\n\n\n\n  老道在心裡狂喊著！\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  就在這時，一股濃重的虛弱感自老道體內傳來，這種虛弱感，像是一晚上安慰關懷了十來個失足一樣，天都開始在旋轉了。\n\n\n\n  「娘咧！」\n\n\n\n  老道心下暗道不好，\n\n\n\n  然後整個人倒退著最後仰面倒在了地上，疲倦的感覺直接襲來，老道更是在剎那間昏厥了過去。\n\n\n\n  武士刀垂落在了地上，這最後的一刀，並沒有砍下去。\n\n\n\n  上頭躺在地上卻一直觀察著這邊情況的許清朗下意識地一口血自嘴角溢出，\n\n\n\n  這太狗血了，明明給了莫大的希望，但卻在最後關頭出了問題？\n\n\n\n  標準的狗血電影套路，卻真實地在自己面前發生了。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯強撐著慢慢地靠著牆壁站了起來，她其實體內一片混亂，煞氣更是脫韁的野馬不停地肆虐著，但她清楚，這個時候不是自己休息的時候了，無論情況多糟，她都要站起來。\n\n\n\n  渾身是血的小蘿莉嵌在牆壁上，看見老道倒下去時，她的嘴角抽了抽，她的脾氣本就不是很好，所以在這個時候，如果不是身體實在有些吃不消的話，她真的很想罵人。 \n\n\n\n  但想來想去，似乎也沒誰能給自己罵了。\n\n\n\n  罵曹頂？\n\n\n\n  他沒多BB，也沒多廢話，更沒有像一些腦殘電視劇里的正派角色喜歡在殺人前廢話一大通，他已經夠果決夠迅速的了。\n\n\n\n  罵老道？\n\n\n\n  他好像也沒什麼可以罵的，他已經做了自己所能做的一切。\n\n\n\n  事實上，當下這批人里，只有老道是一個純粹的人，所以，曹頂想要上身的話，也只能上老道的身，他已經做出自己的貢獻了。\n\n\n\n  最後，小蘿莉覺得，還是有一個人可以罵的。\n\n\n\n  是那個ZZ，\n\n\n\n  他自己跑過來挖了坑，\n\n\n\n  然後當大家累死累活拼命幫他填坑的時候，他卻躺在那裡呼呼大睡！\n\n\n\n  這個ZZ！\n\n\n\n  咬著銀牙，小蘿莉從牆壁內掙扎著走了出來，雖然身形很不穩定，止不住地在搖晃，但她沒得選。\n\n\n\n  沒有配樂，也沒有鮮花，更沒有什麼血紅的旗幟在後面搖擺。\n\n\n\n  明明做著挺光偉正的事兒，但沒有歡呼也沒有啦啦隊，小蘿莉很不喜歡這種感覺，也很反感這種場景。\n\n\n\n  蜘蛛俠沒死，但他站不起來了，他受的傷太嚴重，不過之前出現的巨大創口在此時已經開始結痂。 \n\n\n\n  武士在原地愣了許久，他似乎還沒從剛剛絕望的情緒中走出來，帶著些許的彷徨，他試探性地站起了身。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  他看見倒在地上已經昏厥過去的老道，看見了自己前面一個個身受重傷連保持站姿都止不住搖晃的對手。\n\n\n\n  他很想笑，\n\n\n\n  幸福，\n\n\n\n  來得太突然！\n\n\n\n  一種絕望的情緒在這裡瀰漫起來，這個片段這個畫面這個劇情以及這個節奏，適合放在電影的開頭，而不是片尾。\n\n\n\n  按照電影的劇情，隨後的一大段內容就是這次失敗未能阻止惡魔之後，又有一批新的勇士誕生和出現，最後殺死了惡魔。\n\n\n\n  實際上，小蘿莉自己也清楚，自己這邊戰敗後，大不了就是身死道消，而這個日本武士在禍害了一陣之後，馬上會有附近各地的鬼差捕頭甚至還會有巡檢大人親至趕來。\n\n\n\n  這個日本武士，到最後也逃不脫滅亡的宿命。\n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，又深深地吸了一口氣，小蘿莉張開嘴，但只是伸出舌頭舔了舔自己有些乾裂的嘴唇。\n\n\n\n  武士撿起了自己的武士刀，\n\n\n\n  他的盔甲伸展開，\n\n\n\n  四周刮來了風，\n\n \n\n  風很大，\n\n\n\n  像是他在作無聲放肆的大笑。\n\n\n\n  在犧牲了兩個同伴之後，他笑到了最後。\n\n\n\n  雖然這個過程有不少的波折，雖然剛才的自己還在曹頂的追殺下萬分的狼狽，但局面，最終還是被自己掌控住了！\n\n\n\n  「鏗鏘！」\n\n\n\n  武士舉起了自己的武士刀，一開始指向了前面的老道，隨後又指向了一側的白鶯鶯，最後又指向了另一側的小蘿莉。\n\n\n\n  反派很多都死於話多，不是因為反派都很蠢，而是因為在勝券在握時多裝會兒逼是一種難以拒絕的誘huo，讓人下意識地去沉浸其中。\n\n\n\n  不過，武士也沒有過多的拖延，他先走向了躺在自己面前的老道。\n\n\n\n  舉起刀，\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓！」\n\n\n\n  武士愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  扭過頭，\n\n\n\n  看向身後，\n\n\n\n  那座屬於曹頂的雕塑，在此時忽然砸落了下來。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  武士被壓在了下面，雕塑揚起了巨大的塵土，其內部，居然還有火星在四散，不一會兒，焦煙也瀰漫了出來。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉站在了原地，然後馬上沖了過去，不顧自己的傷勢！ \n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯也發出了一聲厲害，強撐著跟著一起沖了過去。\n\n\n\n  兩個女人站在倒塌的雕塑面前，看著雕塑不斷地起伏，顯然，裡頭的武士正在拼命地掙扎企圖脫困。\n\n\n\n  一聲聲來自靈魂的厲嘯自下面發出，但隨之而來的，是更為熾熱的溫度。\n\n\n\n  有一種叫花雞的做法，就是把處理好塞入其他食材的雞放入溫度極高的泥土下面，等到一定時間後取出，剝開泥土，裡面的雞肉將十分美味。\n\n\n\n  而此時，這名最後的武士，其實就相當於那隻叫花雞。\n\n\n\n  「這是怎麼回事？」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯顯然有些難以理解，\n\n\n\n  「他要被壓死了？」\n\n\n\n  一個剛剛呼風喚雨的鬼武士，就這樣被砸死了？\n\n\n\n  這就像是電影裡給了極大篇幅的反派boss結果還沒出場就因為吃飯被噎死掛了一樣，讓人有些莫名其妙。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉單膝跪地，對著面前已經倒塌下來的雕塑低下了頭，這是一種鬼差表達自己敬意的方式。\n\n\n\n  「曹頂，燃燒了法身，他本可以成為白夫人以及青衣娘娘那種的廟神，事實上他的功德和世代在通城享受的香火比前兩者要高得多得多。\n\n\n\n  但他放棄了這一切，只為了拉著這名武士的亡魂，一起魂飛湮滅，連下地獄謀求一個官身的機會都丟掉了。」 \n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯聞言，愣了一下，然後跟著一起跪了下來。\n\n\n\n  上頭，\n\n\n\n  躺在地上看著這邊情況的許清朗，心裡也是無比的唏噓，英雄的落幕，也著實很讓人感傷。\n\n\n\n  隨後，\n\n\n\n  許清朗看向了自己身邊還在昏迷著的周澤，有些無奈道：\n\n\n\n  「事情都結束了，你還不醒來？」\n\n\n\n  無奈之中，\n\n\n\n  帶著強烈得不滿和幽怨，濃郁得似乎都要化作水滴淌出來。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  「所以，這是怎麼回事？」日本女孩有些好奇地看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  背後的雕塑虛影在燃燒，剩下的一套鎧甲和那杆旗幟也在燃燒，熊熊的火焰將前方完全覆蓋。\n\n\n\n  「是在燃燒自己的神魂和功德。」周澤解釋道。\n\n\n\n  五百年前，曹頂戰死，通城百姓給他建立了曹公祠，修建了倭子墳，五百年的香火供奉，是當地百姓對他的懷念，而今，他將這些東西一個不留通通還了回去，只為了帶走這隻即將出土的惡魔，保地方一個安寧。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己雖然是個通城人，但自己可能做不到這個地步，如果不是因為有著鬼差身份的羈絆，他很可能會在一開始就選擇明哲保身。 \n\n\n\n  正是因為大多數人做不到，所以人們才更加地崇拜英雄，給英雄再多的禮遇再多的香火再多的敬意，也絲毫不為過。\n\n\n\n  火還在燃燒，這片白茫茫的鏡子世界，仿佛在接下來很快會被燒得乾乾淨淨，在失去了曹頂失去了被鎮壓的這些鬼子亡魂之後，將軍山的奇特之處，也將不復存在。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己很快也會得以離開，這些聚集在這裡的亡魂也會在隨後自己進入地獄，他們本就是該進地獄的，所以這幫亡魂周澤送不送，都不算業績的。\n\n\n\n  哦，\n\n\n\n  還是有業績的，\n\n\n\n  比如站在自己身邊的這個日本女孩。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己在這件事上，一直都在打醬油，但好在也不是全無收穫，自己至少可以把這個女孩給送進地獄能賺一點是一點吧。\n\n\n\n  四周的玻璃，開始扭曲和揮發，亡魂們開始四處遊走，他們在等待這裡禁制的徹底消亡，從而去他們應該去的黃泉路。\n\n\n\n  一想到自己即將去見外面的那群朋友，周澤還有些怕怕的，這件事是因為自己要追查所以才捅破的，結果到頭來，自己反倒是被關在鏡子裡頭啥都沒幹成，而外面的那幫人，估計忙壞了吧。\n\n\n\n  這個，不是很好交代啊。\n\n\n\n  從自己衣服里取出了一根煙，再拿出打火機，周澤看見自己的煙和打火機都有些扭曲了起來，連帶著自己的手掌也有些模糊了。 \n\n\n\n  這是即將回去的徵兆，\n\n\n\n  但周澤還是點了煙，\n\n\n\n  隨後，習慣性地拿出了手機。\n\n\n\n  「我們，能出去了麼？」日本女孩問道。\n\n\n\n  「等出去後，我送你去該去的地方。」周澤說道，「如果你有親人的話，我可以事後幫你聯繫他們，給一個最後的交代，不好意思，這是我能做的極限。」\n\n\n\n  「我懂。」女孩很善解人意。\n\n\n\n  周澤聳聳肩，其實，有一件事周澤一直很奇怪，為什麼那個鬼來電可以在鏡子裡撥打出去聯繫到自己，但自己在鏡子裡卻沒辦法撥通出去，難道說這玩意兒是單向聯繫？或者只能聯繫給當地的鬼差？\n\n\n\n  但小蘿莉不也是鬼差麼？\n\n\n\n  還有一件事，既然曹頂能燃燒法神將這些魑魅魍魎都燒個乾淨，為什麼一開始沒燒，難道說一開始他還是存著能保存自己的心思，到最後見局面可能會失控才決定犧牲自己的？\n\n\n\n  當然了，周澤這個念頭並沒有褻瀆英魂的意思，英魂也是人，有這種念頭也很正常。\n\n\n\n  鬼使神差地，\n\n\n\n  周澤點開了電話簿，\n\n\n\n  在這個時候，\n\n\n\n  手機屏幕已經開始變得模糊起來了，四周的一切也都在慢慢地模糊。 \n\n\n\n  周澤選中了那個未知號碼，點了過去，之前其他人的電話他都撥通出去過，但能撥通卻沒人接，這個號碼，周澤反而沒撥過。\n\n\n\n  「嘟…………嘟…………嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  電話居然打通了，\n\n\n\n  「嘟…………嘟…………嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  自己身邊居然也有了電話的聲音響起來。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些意外地放下了手機，\n\n\n\n  看向自己面前的日本女孩。\n\n\n\n  手機的聲音，\n\n\n\n  是從她身上傳來的。\n\n\n\n  女孩愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  扭過頭，\n\n\n\n  看向了周澤，一臉茫然道：\n\n\n\n  「什麼聲音？」\n\n\n\n  周澤看著她，平靜地看著她，她沒穿衣服，之前從溫泉池裡走出來時就沒穿衣服，之後跟著周澤從房間裡跑出來時也沒穿，所以，她身上其實沒有可以放手機的地方。\n\n\n\n  不過，女孩臉上的笑容和迷茫很快消失不見，\n\n\n\n  她伸出手，\n\n\n\n  放在自己胸口，\n\n\n\n  隨後撕開了自己胸口的皮肉，\n\n\n\n  在肋骨夾層之中，有一隻個頭小巧的手機被嵌在裡頭。 \n\n\n\n  「咔嚓！咔嚓！」\n\n\n\n  她扳斷了自己的兩根肋骨，取出了裡面的手機，\n\n\n\n  然後當著周澤的面，將手機貼近自己的臉龐，\n\n\n\n  壓低了嗓門，\n\n\n\n  沉聲道：\n\n\n\n  「餵…………救我…………救我…………我在將軍山…………救我…………」\n\n\n\n  女孩舔了舔自己的嘴唇，像是玩笑被大人看穿了一樣，顯得有些嬌羞。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，她的手輕輕地拍打在剛剛被自己撕開的位置，有些後怕地嬌呼道：\n\n\n\n  「好險呢，\n\n\n\n  我就說這個缺了手指頭的老不死的東西不是那麼好對付的吧，\n\n\n\n  當初神父還很不以為然，說他已經死了五百年了，還能有什麼威脅？\n\n\n\n  只可惜，\n\n\n\n  神父不知道什麼原因居然放了我鴿子，這次居然沒來，不然我真想指著他鼻子罵他一頓，讓他睜開眼看看：\n\n\n\n  剛剛如果我也跟著衝進去，\n\n\n\n  可能現在也被燒死了吧？」",

    "content": "Everyone was wounded, all of them battered and bruised.\n\nLittle Lolita sat on the ground, eyes closed, occasionally kneading the sore spots on her body. Her current body was quite delicate, indeed requiring more attention.\n\nOld Taoist and Spider-Man had been laboriously carried up by Bai Yingying. Old Taoist was still unconscious, his face pale, looking utterly debauched.\n\nHis eye sockets were sunken and dark, lips chapped and white, and his body felt weak, constantly breaking out in cold sweats, twitching occasionally.\n\nOf course, at this moment, no one would mock him. Among those present, Zhou Ze and Little Lolita were Ghost Messengers, Bai Yingying was a Jiangshi, Spider-Man was a living dead, and Xu Qinglang was a mystic cultivator. If they hadn't brought Old Taoist, even if Cao Ding had wanted to possess someone and help at that time, there wouldn't have been a suitable body for him.\n\nBesides, Old Taoist hadn't chickened out even before Cao Ding possessed him at the end. He grabbed a brick and charged in, which was quite manly of him.\n\nSpider-Man's muscles were constantly writhing, as if undergoing self-restoration, but the process was very, very slow.\n\nBai Yingying looked at him and found it somewhat amusing. The once fair and clean priest had now become like this; it had to be said, it was quite ironic.\n\nAnd according to Little Lolita, the priest had been deeply involved in this matter. But who told him to run off and study his own boss's ashes halfway through when he had nothing better to do, only to end up like this?\n\nBai Yingying also felt a lingering fear. If the priest had been here in one piece, perhaps even if Cao Ding had ultimately sacrificed everything of himself, he still might not have been able to successfully prevent the resurrection of those departed souls.\n\nThis priest's ability to stir up trouble was truly too strong. It seemed he had been constantly making things happen for many years, and then he tangled with his own boss,\n\nAnd then,\n\nhe got himself killed.\n\nXu Qinglang leaned against the worn-out sofa, coughing occasionally. He had already simply bandaged his wounds himself; the problem wasn't too big, but the key was that excessive blood loss made him feel a bit weak.\n\nOf those present, the one who seemed most unaffected was Boss Zhou, who had slept from beginning to end.\n\nXu Qinglang irritably extended his foot and lightly kicked Zhou Ze:\n\n“Hey, it's all over, shouldn't you be awake now?”\n\nIf Zhou Ze had joined earlier, perhaps things wouldn't have been so miserable for everyone, and Cao Ding wouldn't have had to be utterly annihilated. He would have still had the chance to use his merits and the incense from worship to seek an official position in the Underworld, or to reincarnate, ensuring his next life would be happy and smooth sailing.\n\nInstead of now, where his soul was directly scattered and everything turned to nothingness.\n\nIt wasn't that Xu Qinglang blamed Zhou Ze; it was just that men, you know, when they're ineffective at a crucial moment, when you desperately need and long for their prowess, they just turn their heads and pretend to be asleep and play dumb—it's always very uncomfortable!\n\nLittle Lolita let out a long breath, exhaling a slight reddish mist. Her body felt much lighter than before; she was using a breathing technique to treat her internal injuries.\n\nOpening her eyes, she looked at Zhou Ze, who was still unconscious.\n\nLittle Lolita strangely reached out and touched Zhou Ze's forehead.\n\nBai Yingying closely watched Little Lolita's every move, worried that Little Lolita would take a risk and simply seize this opportunity to kill her boss.\n\n“He should be awake now.”\n\nLittle Lolita said.\n\nImmediately, Little Lolita pointed to all the reflective objects around them, such as mirrors, picture frames, and even tiles. Without exception, all of them had dense cracks.\n\nThe barrier had already shattered,\n\nLittle Lolita had previously guessed that Zhou Ze's consciousness might be in the mirror world. Now that everything was over, he should have returned.\n\nBut then, Little Lolita suddenly let out a “gasp,” immediately retracting the hand she had placed on Zhou Ze's forehead. She spread her palm out in front of her and saw, to her surprise, a layer of frostbite marks.\n\n“What’s going on?” Little Lolita asked, looking gravely at the still unconscious Zhou Ze.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's face gradually began to change. His skin started to shrivel, simultaneously taking on an eerie bronze color. Two fangs slowly pushed out from between his lips, and his body exuded a terrifying chill, even more so than when Bai Yingying was fighting.\n\nThis was the first time Little Lolita had faced Zhou Ze in this form. Before, she had only heard Old Taoist tease about how incredibly formidable their boss became when he unleashed his ultimate power.\n\nNow, she believed it.\n\n“Boss?” Bai Yingying immediately leaned closer, looking at Zhou Ze with concern.\n\n“Is he…,” Xu Qinglang mumbled, frowning at the scene before him, “is he having a nightmare?”\n\n…………\n\nThe collapse within the mirror world was now unstoppable. Even the departed souls in the outer regions had begun to gradually disappear, returning to reality and then naturally entering the Underworld. This was their rightful destination, but it had been delayed by the special environment here.\n\nThe girl faced Zhou Ze, a smile on her face. Her initial panic and mindless rage were gone, replaced by a certain serenity.\n\n“Anyway, I really do have to thank you.”\n\nThe girl bowed very seriously to Zhou Ze. It was a gesture of courtesy.\n\n“Only by following you could I be 100% certain of escaping from here.”\n\nYes, the girl was telling the truth. She could have chosen to act together with the three Japanese samurai, but she was worried about unforeseen circumstances, such as the guy who had suppressed her for five hundred years.\n\nAnd indeed, that guy had actually given up his merits and the incense from worship just to utterly annihilate them!\n\nThat ball of fire had now extinguished, but it still made the girl feel a lingering fear.\n\nAnd by choosing to follow Zhou Ze, entering the game as the “blocking” party, if Zhou Ze won, she would gain her freedom. If Zhou Ze lost, she would be even freer. It was like a war where she had placed bets on both sides; no matter the outcome, she couldn't lose.\n\nThe girl held her phone, constantly shaking it up and down.\n\nPeople grow old and become shrewd—this is how some wise elders are described, because they live long and experience many changing situations.\n\nAs for this woman, she had lived for five hundred years. On top of those five hundred years, it was only natural for her to employ some schemes and tactics.\n\n“I truly didn’t expect things to be this way,” Zhou Ze said.\n\nNow, Zhou Ze finally understood why Cao Ding hadn't initially chosen to simply and crudely annihilate all the ghost warriors attempting to revive.\n\nBecause Cao Ding knew,\n\nthere was still one person who hadn't entered the trap,\n\nBut in the end, there was truly no other way, and he had to leave behind one who had slipped through the net, because this one was too cautious and too careful.\n\nCao Ding had intended to eliminate all future troubles in a single decisive strike,\n\nbut he failed.\n\n“Do you want to see what I looked like before?”\n\nThe girl swayed her waist,\n\nSoon,\n\nshe appeared in an OL outfit, looking intellectual and capable.\n\nNext, she appeared in a dress, looking shy and adorable.\n\nThen, a graceful Hanfu, looking fresh and ethereal.\n\nSlowly, she changed into casual wear, wearing white hotel cotton slippers. These were the clothes she wore on the day the incident occurred, when she was assaulted by the three Japan-obsessed fanatics.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe clothes on her body began to melt, transforming into jet-black fabric that slowly clung to her. This was the attire of a female ninja, her original garb, the clothes she wore when she died!\n\nOver five hundred years ago, she and her accomplices had just landed and broken into the city gates when they were repelled by Cao Ding leading the townsfolk. She herself, during Cao Ding's pursuit, had her head severed by Cao Ding's blade.\n\n“I told you, mirrors can record images. They are very objective and impartial; they faithfully recorded everything that happened back then.\n\nBut precisely because of their impartiality, they give people a misconception: that the scenes within them are all real.\n\nAnd the more real something appears, the more elements of lies it often contains behind it.”\n\nThe female ninja tilted her head slightly, looking at Zhou Ze as if teasing a younger brother,\n\n“Do you feel horrified now? Do you feel a sense of humiliation, as if you’ve been played in the palm of my hand?”\n\nThe female ninja deliberately stepped closer, moving a little nearer to Zhou Ze, and continued to provoke him:\n\n“Did it never occur to you why those three guys would coincidentally gather here?\n\nDid it never occur to you why next door there happened to be me, this Japanese girl who, upon hearing Japanese music, would actively knock on the door wanting to join the party, but then, when things happened, would uncharacteristically and bashfully resist?”\n\nZhou Ze nodded, admitting, “I was careless.”\n\nFrom the very beginning, Zhou Ze had been drawn into the scheme. Whether it was taking their place in “imprisonment” or his final actions, in truth, he had been completely manipulated.\n\n“Heh heh.”\n\nThe female ninja laughed, a very happy laugh, and continued:\n\n“You know, seducing those three guys was quite interesting. But they were useless, so quick. Their bodies were truly weak. I, frankly, hadn't even gotten comfortable, and with a slight squeeze, they’d already burst their dam<sup>1</sup>.”\n\nThere were a total of four spirits,\n\none responsible for seduction,\n\nthree responsible for possession,\n\na clear division of labor,\n\nexecuted flawlessly.\n\nThat’s how she was able to enter Zhou Ze’s room from the room next door.\n\nOf course, her ability to maintain restraint even when Zhou Ze was dismembering her, perfectly portraying a revenge-driven female spirit, was indeed her true skill.\n\nZhou Ze’s body was slowly undergoing a transformation,\n\nIn reality,\n\nthe changes in his body in reality were merely a manifestation driven by his consciousness.\n\nIn the mirror world,\n\nZhou Ze's skin had slowly turned bronze, his flesh began to shrivel, and deep within his eyes, flickering, was a grim darkness like black flames.\n\nThe female ninja was somewhat astonished, astonished by Zhou Ze’s transformation, astonished by the terrifying aura emanating from him now.\n\nBut she wasn’t afraid,\n\nand continued to laugh:\n\n“It’s too late. This place will shatter soon. When it does, I can just find any intact mirror to leave through. You won’t find me, you won’t catch me,\n\nI am free!”\n\nZhou Ze slowly lowered his head,\n\nas if he hadn’t heard the girl’s words at all.\n\nThe girl froze. She turned her head back and found Zhou Ze still with his head lowered.\n\nHe wasn’t talking to her?\n\nThen who was he talking to?\n\nThe girl was somewhat puzzled.\n\n“Oh… understood…”\n\nZhou Ze seemed to be talking to himself,\n\nAnd in fact,\n\nhe really was talking to himself.\n\nHe reached into his pocket,\n\nand pulled out a bronze ring,\n\n“Understood… Interesting… This thing… You can’t use it… can you?”\n\nStill talking to himself,\n\nbut the female ninja sensed an intense feeling of crisis,\n\na feeling that was even clearer than when Zhou Ze had transformed and his aura became terrifying!\n\nShe began to dash towards the periphery. She had to get out of here!\n\nCao Ding was dead,\n\nno one could restrain her anymore,\n\nFreedom,\n\nwas right before her!\n\n“Ding…”\n\nZhou Ze's black fingernail lightly flicked the ring,\n\nand the ring emitted a crisp sound,\n\nThen,\n\na blue light screen emanated from the ring,\n\ninstantly enveloping the entire space.\n\nThe female ninja’s body heavily collided with the light screen and bounced back,\n\nher eyes filled with terror and disbelief,\n\nThe restriction that had clearly been shattered into pieces just moments ago,\n\nhad astonishingly restored itself at this moment!\n\nNo,\n\nthat wasn’t it,\n\nthe female ninja realized,\n\nit was a new restriction, re-covering this place!\n\nShe was trapped again!\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head. His back was still somewhat hunched,\n\nhis arms naturally hung low, elongated, his long fingernails looking as if they could touch the ground at any moment.\n\nA hint of mockery played on his lips,\n\nand in his eye sockets, black flames stared with a hint of excitement at the female ninja before him,\n\nliking what he saw more and more,\n\nas if looking at a bottle of,\n\nfive-hundred-year-old aged wine…\n____________________\n<sup>1</sup> An idiom meaning a sudden, uncontrollable release, here used in a sexually explicit context.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze's body was still swaying slightly, like a decrepit old man, or an alcoholic drunkard, as if he could fall to the ground at any moment.\n\nBut the terrifying aura emanating from him possessed such an intense oppressive feeling.\n\nThe female ninja tried to open the blue light barrier. She wanted to leave here. She and her three companions had painstakingly managed to destroy the restriction left by Cao Ding, but reality was so cruel.\n\nShe had finally escaped her original cage, but next, she entered an even larger and stronger one.\n\nZhou Ze slowly walked over, his form still swaying slightly. As he approached, the expression on the female ninja's face grew increasingly solemn.\n\nShe didn't dare to actively attack Zhou Ze, just like someone who accidentally falls into a tiger cage; the first reaction is definitely to climb out of the cage, not foolishly fight the tiger.\n\nZhou Ze was that tiger in the cage, a man-eater.\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had been thinking of letting the others in the bookstore fight desperately outside. As the boss, he was just watching the show, not even acting as a cheerleader. It was indeed a bit indefensible.\n\nNow,\n\nit was rather good.\n\nZhou Ze even had to thank the woman in front of him for giving him a chance to do something, so he wouldn't be scorned by Xu Qinglang and the others after leaving the mirror world.\n\n\"We can make a deal.\"\n\nEvery prey, before death, would try every means to find a chance to escape. The female ninja was no exception.\n\n\"Before you died... you were just an ordinary person...\"\n\nThe sarcasm on Zhou Ze's lips grew stronger.\n\nYes,\n\nfive hundred years ago, when you were killed by Cao Ding, you were just ordinary Wokou*. No matter how brutal, you were still just ordinary people.\n\nSince you were ordinary people, and suppressed here for five hundred years, what could you possibly offer that would interest me?\n\nThe female ninja showed a pleading expression.\n\nZhou Ze closed in step by step.\n\nJust then, the female ninja's figure dissipated on the spot, appearing behind Zhou Ze in an instant. In her hand was a black dagger, which she plunged directly towards Zhou Ze's neck.\n\nEverything happened in an instant.\n\n\"Puh!\"\n\nThe dagger plunged in!\n\nThe female ninja showed great joy.\n\nHer sneak attack had actually succeeded!\n\nHe was arrogant to such a degree, thinking he had her cornered?!\n\nThe female ninja really wanted to laugh at this moment, but she controlled her emotions, preparing to twist the dagger and, with the momentum, slice off Zhou Ze's entire head.\n\nBut all she heard was a \"grinding\" sound of muscle friction.\n\nNo matter how much force the female ninja exerted, she still couldn't budge the dagger even slightly, because Zhou Ze's muscles and bones had actually jammed the dagger completely, as if it were embedded in his own body.\n\nThe female ninja's gaze hardened, and her figure immediately opted to retreat.\n\n\"CRACK!\"\n\nBut all she heard was a crisp sound.\n\nZhou Ze twisted his head.\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe female ninja only felt her entire body fly, with the sound of wind rushing past her ears. It was a despair-inducing speed.\n\n\"CRASH!\"\n\nZhou Ze, with one hand clutching the female ninja's neck, directly pressed her to the ground, while sliding for nearly a hundred meters!\n\n\"Urgh...\"\n\nA low moan emanated from Zhou Ze's throat, like a prayer before a meal, thanking God for blessing him with such abundant food.\n\nThe female ninja's body trembled. This was not the trembling one felt when facing an enemy. Even five hundred years ago, when she, as a female ninja, came to the Chinese coast with others, whether encountering Ming Dynasty soldiers or finally Cao Ding, whether in victory or defeat, she had never been afraid. What's more, she now possessed an additional five hundred years of psychological experience compared to before.\n\nBut at this moment, she truly felt a fear that originated from the depths of her soul, because she felt she wasn't facing a person, but rather pressure from the food chain.\n\nIt was as if she, by nature, was his food. This oppressive feeling was like a zebra, lost and encountering a lion.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails pierced into the female ninja's neck. At the same time, the surrounding black mist began to instantly compress.\n\nAround them, the sound of a juicer operating could be heard. And indeed, that was what was happening.\n\nSimple,\n\ndirect,\n\nbrutal,\n\nastonishing,\n\nand at the same time, somewhat shocking and unbearable to look at directly.\n\nA wisp of green smoke rose up. Zhou Ze tilted his head back and inhaled sharply.\n\nThe green smoke entered his nose,\n\nbringing an immense pleasure,\n\nlike a well-bred old lady smoking a hookah.\n\nSmacking his lips,\n\nlicking his lips,\n\nand then his body gave a slight shiver.\n\nEverything,\n\nfelt comfortable.\n\nThe existence of a departed soul, even if she had existed for five hundred years and had undergone special cooperation and modification with the priest, but in Zhou Ze's eyes at this moment,\n\nshe was just a puff of smoke.\n\nSlowly exhaling,\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat down.\n\nHe reached up and gently placed his hand on his forehead,\n\nlike an old man after a hearty meal, ready to bask in the sun and take a nap.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour passed.\n\nZhou Ze put his hand down.\n\nIn his eyes, a strange green light still flickered,\n\nbut the expression on his face was somewhat unusual.\n\nIt was confusion,\n\nbewilderment,\n\nand panic.\n\nSuch emotions appearing on him were somewhat unnatural. Back then, after battling Lady Qingyi and then the Japanese priest, he then eradicated the problematic Ghost Messenger possessing his sister-in-law in the Lin family, and subsequently annihilated two Ghost Messengers in Yancheng.\n\nIt seemed that whenever he appeared, it often meant that whatever the situation around him,\n\nit was time for things to settle.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nhe was truly a bit flustered.\n\n\"How come... I can't go back?\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself, as if contemplating this question. But at this moment, he wasn't really good at thinking, like a drowsy person waking up halfway, relying entirely on their blurry consciousness,\n\ngetting out of bed,\n\nfinding a chamber pot,\n\nunbuttoning his trousers,\n\nturning on the faucet,\n\nthen lying back down and continuing to sleep.\n\nMaybe if anyone asked the next day, he wouldn't even be sure if he had gotten out of bed to pee.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head,\n\nhis eyes showing horror.\n\nHe stretched out a finger,\n\npointed at the sky curtain,\n\nthen clenched his fist and slammed it heavily onto the ground.\n\nHe understood.\n\n\"This time it's consciousness... the body isn't here... it's over... the body won't hold up...\"\n\n............\n\n\"So, every time your boss 'goes berserk'**, he turns into this?\"\n\nThe little loli stood by, staring at Zhou Ze's body and asking somewhat strangely.\n\n\"Mmm, normal operation, it's fine.\"\n\nBai Yingying seemed very calm. Every time the boss went berserk, his body would have some problems, requiring him to be paralyzed for half a month; she was already accustomed to it.\n\nMoreover, Bai Yingying actually quite liked the boss when he was paralyzed, because she could take care of him completely, including bathing him. At that time, the boss was the cutest, and when he needed her the most.\n\n\"Cough, cough...\"\n\nXu Qinglang coughed beside them, while taking out a wet towel to wipe the Old Daoist's face. The Old Daoist was still unconscious, not having woken up.\n\nThe little loli continued to stare at Zhou Ze, examining him. Although she didn't know what had happened to Zhou Ze in his dream, the changes in Zhou Ze's body at this moment were enough to make her very interested.\n\nAfter another quarter of an hour, the little loli pointed at Zhou Ze's right arm and asked, \"Is this normal too?\"\n\n\"Normal.\" Bai Yingying said without lifting her head.\n\nThe boss's body would show many wounds; this was a sign of his body being overloaded.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\nThe little loli pointed at Zhou Ze's right elbow.\n\nThe bone in that area was already exposed, the flesh split open. At the same time, the exposed white bone was actually turning black. This was a sign of a body decaying, meaning the nutrients within the bone were rapidly draining away, about to return to dust.\n\nHow did that song go:\n\n\"Turning into spring mud, nurturing the earth...\"\n\nThe little loli had no doubt: if Zhou Ze were thrown into the courtyard at this moment, by the time of grave-sweeping next year, an extremely lush patch of plants should have grown there.\n\nShe seemed to also be able to plant a loquat tree sapling there. That way, she could write in her diary later:\n\n\"In the courtyard, there is a loquat tree. It was planted by my hand in the year of my captain's death. Now, it stands tall and covers [the area] like a canopy.\"***\n\nShe turned her head, seeing Bai Yingying taking it completely in stride.\n\nThe little loli briefly wondered if she was overthinking it.\n\nOr was Zhou Ze's life force simply that formidable?\n\nFrom the sound of it, this happened often before,\n\nbut damn it, this was going at a pace where he could recover even from turning to ash!\n\nAlthough they were all ghosts,\n\nyou still had to talk about some science, right?\n\nSo, the little loli walked to Bai Yingying's side, extended her tender hand, grabbed Bai Yingying's face, and brought her face close to the blackening bone in Zhou Ze's arm:\n\n\"I'll struggle one last time. If he can recover from this and bounce back as lively as before, from now on, I'll serve him hand and foot, wash his feet, and warm his bed!\"\n\nIf he could recover completely from this state,\n\nthis kind of captain, this kind of boss,\n\nwhat would it matter if she held her nose and accepted him?\n\nBai Yingying suddenly felt as if she had been struck by lightning.\n\nThen opened her mouth.\n\nShe subconsciously reached out and touched the boss's exposed bone.\n\n\"CRACK!\"\n\nThe bone actually caved in.\n\n\"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying began to scream.\n\nXu Qinglang, who was still wiping the Old Daoist's face, was so startled that his face went pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, spraying it onto the Old Daoist's face.\n\nDamn it, he was really scared so badly he coughed up blood!\n\nThe feeling of a zombie suddenly screaming behind you was truly not something an ordinary person could endure.\n\n\"Boss, Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying knelt beside Zhou Ze, screaming hoarsely, but she dared not touch Zhou Ze again, for fear that whatever part she touched next would collapse.\n\nThe little loli let out a long breath.\n\nHer persistence was right.\n\nThis was normal, after all; even a Judge of the Underworld**** couldn't achieve this.\n\nThen,\n\nthe little loli tilted her head, staring at Zhou Ze, her fingers gently intertwined, feeling a little conflicted.\n\nShe was thinking,\n\nif Zhou Ze just died like this, inexplicably in his sleep,\n\nshe wouldn't really be at a loss, huh?\n\nNo loss, no loss.\n\nTruly no loss.\n\n---\n*   **Wokou (倭寇):** A historical term referring to Japanese pirates who raided the coastlines of China and Korea, particularly from the 13th to 16th centuries.\n**   **Go berserk (開無雙):** Literally \"open unparalleled.\" This is a gaming term, often used to describe unleashing an ultimate attack or wiping out numerous enemies effortlessly, akin to \"going berserk\" or \"unleashing an ultimate attack.\"\n***   **\"In the courtyard, there is a loquat tree...\":** An adaptation of a famous classical Chinese line from Gui Youguang's essay \"Record of Xiang Ji's Study\" (《項脊軒志》).

    "content": "\"Boss, wake up, boss, boss, wake up!\"\n\nBai Yingying shouted anxiously by his side, hoping to wake Zhou Ze, but of course, facts proved it was futile.\n\nThe little loli sat on the dilapidated sofa nearby, swinging her legs, silent. Although deep down she was quite looking forward to Zhou Ze kicking the bucket like this, she was also worried about over-provoking the female zombie, who might then come and fight her to the death.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze wasn't dead yet, and when things hadn't settled, it was really hard to say what would happen.\n\nShe lowered her head and looked at a piece of broken glass on the ground.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nThe little loli couldn't be sure,\n\neven if Zhou Ze was unconscious, whether he still had the ability to sever her soul blood.\n\nXu Qinglang also knelt beside him, checking Zhou Ze's condition. He was the first to come to his senses and immediately said, \"Mud!\"\n\n\"Your dad?\"\n\nThe little loli was confused.\n\n\"Yes, mud! Where's Monkey? Where's Monkey?\"\n\nBai Yingying glanced around and then realized she hadn't brought Monkey this time. Even taking the boss to the hospital now wouldn't be useful; only Monkey's mud offered hope of stopping the boss's body from continuously deteriorating.\n\n\"Take the boss back!\"\n\nBai Yingying made the decision.\n\nTake the boss back to the bookstore, find Monkey!\n\nAt this moment, the little loli immediately spoke up, \"Don't move him, you can't transfer him away. His consciousness is very likely nearby.\"\n\nThe little loli was right. Even if she wished Zhou Ze would kick the bucket sooner, she wouldn't dare to be too blatant.\n\n\"Also, with his current physical condition, how can you transfer him? Aren't you afraid his body will just fall apart?\" the little loli added.\n\n\"Then what do we do?\"\n\nBai Yingying was clearly a bit flustered.\n\n\"Wake up Old Dao.\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the unconscious Old Dao, \"He has Monkey's phone number.\"\n\nIf an outsider heard this, they would probably be quite surprised.\n\nBut that was the truth.\n\nThe monkey in the bookstore had a phone.\n\nAnd the person bored enough to buy a phone for a monkey was Old Dao.\n\nWhen Monkey had nothing to do, he'd use the phone in the bookstore to connect via Bluetooth and play music, or help Old Dao by holding the phone to film when Old Dao was live streaming.\n\nBut in the bookstore, other than Old Dao, no one else would be so idle as to go ask Monkey for its number to save it.\n\nXu Qinglang first patted Old Dao's body. The phone was found, but it had already been damaged in the recent battle. Finally, Xu Qinglang let out a long breath and pointed at Old Dao:\n\n\"We have to wake him up.\"\n\nWithout a word, Bai Yingying immediately plunged her fingernail into Old Dao's chest. An icy chill instantly entered him.\n\nOld Dao's body shuddered, and he immediately opened his eyes.\n\n\"Hiss... I'm freezing to death!\"\n\nThis was akin to a method of stimulating life potential, but Old Dao had just been possessed by a ghost, which had already stimulated his potential once. With another stimulation now, the seventy-year-old Old Dao's body was truly struggling to cope.\n\nAt that moment, Old Dao was awake, but he instinctively hugged himself, shivering intensely, his lips also somewhat purple, clearly freezing cold.\n\n\"I'll use my corpse core to warm and nourish your body, helping you replenish your vital energy.\"\n\nBai Yingying said to Old Dao very seriously. She knew how much damage forcefully stimulating Old Dao awake at this moment would do to his body, but things had reached this point; she had no choice.\n\nOld Dao continuously exhaled white mist, trembling as he first looked at Bai Yingying, then at the boss lying beside him.\n\n\"The boss's body is in trouble; he needs Monkey's mud,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\nOld Dao nodded. \"1... 3... 8...\"\n\nOld Dao reported Monkey's phone number. Xu Qinglang made the call beside him, and soon someone answered:\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak...\" Monkey's voice was quite cheerful.\n\n\"Something's happened to the boss. Come to the Hot Spring Resort on General's Mountain and find us,\" Xu Qinglang said, suppressing a strong sense of incongruity.\n\nNormally, Xu Qinglang would definitely think he'd been kicked in the head by a donkey, to actually say something like that to a monkey, and even call a monkey.\n\n\"Monkey... come...\"\n\nOld Dao shouted, shivering beside him.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak... Squeak, squeak, squeak...\"\n\nAnother series of squeaks came from the other end of the phone, and then it was hung up.\n\nXu Qinglang looked at his phone, still somewhat disbelieving. \"Can it come?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's very smart.\"\n\nOld Dao said, then lay down on the ground again. He was in great discomfort, and even, a flush appeared on his face, which surprisingly became rosy and radiant.\n\nXu Qinglang's pupils immediately constricted, and he shouted at Old Dao, \"Hold on, you can't sleep now!\"\n\nYou're showing signs of a final burst of life.\n\nXu Qinglang was really worried that Zhou Ze wouldn't be dead yet, but Old Dao would kick the bucket first.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nBai Yingying spat out a white, frosty pearl core from her mouth, which floated above Old Dao's chest.\n\nOld Dao let out a long breath,\n\nfeeling only a warm sensation flowing through his limbs and bones, much more comfortable.\n\nAt that moment, he closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep again.\n\nMeanwhile, Bai Yingying continued to keep her pearl core at Old Dao's chest to sustain his life, while her own skin began to look haggard and wrinkled. Her original high school student appearance was slowly aging.\n\nThe little loli sat nearby, looking at this group of people constantly courting death, truly speechless.\n\nAt that moment, she jumped off the sofa. Just as she took a step, Bai Yingying's originally weak gaze suddenly sharpened.\n\n\"Don't even think about it.\"\n\n\"Here you go again,\" the little loli shrugged. \"Why do you like threatening me so much?\"\n\n\"If the boss dies, he'll definitely drag you down as a burial sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Can't you come up with a fresher line?\"\n\nThe little loli looked up,\n\ngazed at the sky.\n\nDie, die,\n\nLet them all die.\n\nAfter they're all dead, Tongcheng would be much quieter, and she could go back to her old pace of life.\n\nThe feeling of being someone's subordinate, toiling like an ox or a horse,\n\nreally wasn't very good.\n\nBai Yingying reached into her pocket and took out a certificate.\n\nThe little loli's previously scattered gaze immediately focused on this certificate. It was Zhou Ze's Ghost Messenger Badge!\n\n\"You can abandon any extravagant hopes, like hoping the boss can't crush your soul blood while unconscious.\n\nI'm telling you very clearly now:\n\nif the boss dies, I will guard his tomb in the human world,\n\nand you,\n\nwill have to go down as a maid to be buried with the boss!\"\n\n\"%￥#@@&&...*!!!!!\"\n\nCountless grass-mud horses* galloped through the little loli's mind.\n\nWhy must women make things difficult for other women!\n\nWhat are you trying to do!\n\n..................\n\nHe looked up,\n\nheld his forehead,\n\nand through the gaps in his fingers, his green eyes were still watching the blue light curtain flickering above.\n\nIn fact, the ring had already returned to Zhou Ze's side.\n\nBut once the light curtain was activated, even if the ring was immediately withdrawn, it would continue to exist for a period of time.\n\nThat is to say, just now, the barrier Zhou Ze had reset with the ring had, while trapping the female ninja, also trapped himself.\n\nIt was hard to imagine what state his body would be in after such a long time.\n\nIn the past, whenever he entered this state, it would automatically end after a short while due to his body's distress, but this time, his consciousness and body were separated because of the mirror. This led to his body being unable to directly affect Zhou Ze's consciousness, and the final result would be his body completely collapsing under the strain, until it disintegrated!\n\nZhou Ze's chest continuously heaved,\n\nevery minute that passed made him more dangerous.\n\nBut he had no other choice, and no more room for maneuver.\n\nHe could only continue to sit like this,\n\nwaiting like this.\n\nLayers of faint, crystalline radiance continuously rose from Zhou Ze's body. The reaction of his consciousness affected his body, and the collapse of his body also affected his consciousness.\n\nA mirror, isolating everything.\n\nHe couldn't even sever his connection with his body and become a lone wandering ghost. His soul and body were not connected to each other, like two rocks bound together, destined to sink to the bottom of the sea and drown together.\n\nThe final outcome was that they would all be finished; neither side could escape.\n\nThe blue light curtain was clearly diminishing continuously,\n\nbut Zhou Ze felt he couldn't hold on until the light curtain dissipated.\n\nThis pit,\n\nwas too deep.\n\n\"This time... I'm really... going to play myself... to death...\"\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly saw a layer of black substance appearing on his skin. It covered his body like a dog-skin plaster.\n\n\"Low-grade... trash...\"\n\nZhou Ze instinctively reached out to tear off this thing that had suddenly appeared on his body,\n\nbut in the next moment,\n\nhe stopped.\n\nHe saw that after these black things covered his body,\n\nthe rate at which the crystalline radiance on his body was dissipating,\n\nhad noticeably slowed down.\n\n..................\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Bai Yingying asked, leaning weakly on the ground, watching the little loli rummage through the pile of rubble below.\n\n\"You truly deserve to be drowned in a pig cage!\"\n\nThe little loli cursed viciously,\n\nthen continuously picked out broken armor from the rubble. The second Ghost Warrior had been decapitated by Cao Ding's blade, so all parts of his armor except the helmet were still intact. However, in the area beneath the statue, the last Ghost Warrior who had burned to death had all his parts, except for the helmet, melted away.\n\nJust right, the little loli gathered them all, making a complete set.\n\nThe little loli carried the items back,\n\nbent down,\n\nand put the armor onto Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\"Is it useful?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Even a kitchen knife, if kept by a departed soul and nurtured for five hundred years, can become a magical artifact.\" The little loli rolled her eyes disdainfully at Xu Qinglang and continued with her work.\n\nSoon,\n\nparts of Zhou Ze's body were covered in black Japanese samurai armor.\n\n\"Creak... Creak... Creak...\"\n\nCracking sounds continued to emanate intermittently,\n\nThe little loli was worried at first,\n\nbut after careful observation, she realized that\n\nit wasn't Zhou Ze's body breaking now, but rather the armor slowly cracking, meaning the armor was absorbing damage for Zhou Ze.\n\nWhat the little loli didn't see was that,\n\nthe parts of Zhou Ze's flesh that were originally torn and bloody, in minute detail,\n\nhad already slowly begun a strange fusion with this set of armor.\n***\n*   **Grass-mud horse (草泥馬)**: A Chinese internet meme that is a pun on a vulgar phrase, used as a form of coded profanity or humorous expression of frustration.",

    "content": "Remember the popcorn vendors who used to be everywhere on the streets and alleys a decade or so ago?\n\nCarrying their small stoves,\n\nWarming charcoal embers,\n\nShaking the handle,\n\nThe small stove continuously made \"crackling\" sounds, while a faint aroma wafted out.\n\nZhou Ze was like this at the moment;\n\nAfter the loli put the Japanese samurai armor on Zhou Ze, the armor and Zhou Ze's body incessantly emitted these \"crisp sounds,\" like eggs being cracked and poured into a hot oil pan.\n\nBai Yingying stood by, watching with concern from time to time. She didn't mind her gradually aging face at all, focusing wholeheartedly on her boss.\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette nearby, puffing away by himself.\n\nJust like an ordinary family, if someone falls seriously ill, any family that values relationships would sell everything they own* to send them to the hospital for treatment. Regardless of whether the family would fall apart, at least everyone in the family had to be safe and sound.\n\nXu Qinglang felt this way now: no matter how severely injured everyone was, or how great the price paid, as long as everyone was fine in the end, it was still worth it.\n\n\"Girl, take back your bead. This poor Daoist is fine now.\"\n\nThe old Daoist had woken up after two hours of sleep. Opening his eyes, he saw the bead still rising and falling on his chest. He then looked at Bai Yingying next to him, whose hair had turned white, and felt a pang of heartache.\n\nWhat a good girl. Although she was a zombie, she was also very pretty. To become like this for him, this seventy-year-old wretched old man*, it was truly a waste.\n\nIt must be said that although the old Daoist was a bit muddled in his ways normally, and didn't shy away from petty thievery and underhanded dealings*, few knew that he had been continuously donating to education, sponsoring over a hundred students in the Daliang Mountains alone.\n\nZhou Ze once asked him why, despite earning a lot from live streaming, he was still all alone* now, without even a house.\n\nEven if live streaming was a nascent industry in recent years, Zhou Ze felt that with the old Daoist's past \"feudal superstition\"* dealings and his silver tongue*, his ability to swindle money should have been considerable, not to the extent of faring so poorly.\n\nThe reason was right here.\n\nThe old Daoist had always felt he belonged to a Daoist family*, where generations before him, though each worse than the last*, still possessed some spiritual cultivation and aspirations. Only by his generation had he completely become an insignificant character*. He could only rely on doing these things, hoping that if he went to the afterlife and met his ancestors*, he would at least have one thing to say, so as not to completely disgrace them.\n\nSeeing the old Daoist wake up, Bai Yingying checked his physical condition. Seeing that he was out of mortal danger, she immediately retrieved her Essence Pearl. But by then, her skin was wrinkled and her hair had turned white, giving her the distinct appearance of Lian Nishang from 'The Bride With White Hair'.\n\nThe loli kept squatting nearby, watching Zhou Ze's condition. Although Zhou Ze's injuries were still continuously worsening, it was evident that the rate of deterioration had slowed down significantly compared to the beginning.\n\nExtending her tender hand, the loli tried to pull open the armor to look, but was astonished to find that Zhou Ze's ruptured flesh had actually fused with the armor.\n\nWas this good or bad?\n\nThe loli couldn't tell.\n\nShe also didn't dare to voice this discovery, fearing she might provoke the female zombie who was already so protective of her master that she'd gone a bit mad*.\n\nThe old Daoist laboriously sat up, took the water from Xu Qinglang, drank two sips, and then looked at his boss's appearance again.\n\nIt was at this moment,\n\nA piece of glass embedded in the wall above suddenly shattered,\n\nAnd then,\n\nA terrifying aura suddenly descended!\n\nThe female zombie's body trembled,\n\nScared, she prostrated herself on the ground,\n\nThis was a suppression from her bloodline, forcing her to submit.\n\nSpider-Man Father, who was nearby, also suddenly opened his eyes at this moment, kneeling on the ground, still trembling despite his injuries.\n\nThe loli stood up with a solemn expression, not daring to take a breath, but cold sweat was already dripping from her forehead. This aura was too terrifying; it felt as if the other party could just extract and devour her soul from her body if they wished.\n\nIn contrast, the old Daoist and Xu Qinglang felt nothing, as their cultivation levels weren't high enough to experience such details.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nThat aura vanished.\n\nBai Yingying immediately crawled over to check on her boss.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes trembled slightly, then slowly opened. The first thing he saw was Bai Yingying, with white hair and a haggard face.\n\n\"Ah,\"\n\nHe sighed,\n\nThen Zhou Ze closed his eyes again.\n\nFirstly, at this time, his physical condition didn't allow him to say much or do anything.\n\nSecondly, saying too much at this point would be overly sentimental. Having lived two lives, and single in both*, Zhou Ze was consistently bad at handling such matters.\n\nSo,\n\nHe continued to keep his eyes closed,\n\nPlaying dead.\n\nThis was like a scumbag, after using someone, blocking their contact information and pretending to disappear. This was a skill tree that men were born with*, requiring no instruction.\n\n\"He's awake,\" the loli said.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak............\"\n\nJust then,\n\nThe monkey's sounds came from outside. It had actually found its way here!\n\nWhat an outrageously intelligent monkey!\n\n..................\n\nIf, at first, Zhou Ze was only pretending to be asleep because he felt awkward facing Bai Yingying, Xu Qinglang, and the old Daoist, then afterward, he had actually truly fallen unconscious again.\n\nThis time, his body was too drained*, and of course, his soul's exhaustion was also considerable.\n\nHe didn't know how long he had been unconscious, perhaps half a month or so.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze opened his eyes again, he found himself lying on the bed in the bookstore's second-floor bedroom. Bai Yingying was wiping his body with a wet towel.\n\nWhat met his eyes,\n\nWas still white hair.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously raised his hand, his fingertips touching the ends of Bai Yingying's hair.\n\nBai Yingying's body trembled. She turned her head, looking at Zhou Ze with surprise, and called out, \"Boss, you're awake!\"\n\n\"Mm,\"\n\nZhou Ze responded.\n\n\"Do you want to sit up?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nBai Yingying took a pillow and propped Zhou Ze up, helping him sit against the window sill.\n\n\"Your face............\" Zhou Ze began.\n\nUpon hearing this, a hint of sadness appeared on Bai Yingying's face. She seemed to think her boss found her no longer pretty or youthful like a high schooler, and thus wouldn't want her anymore. She said anxiously:\n\n\"Boss, please don't worry. I'll quickly cultivate to recover, replenishing my essence. I can wear a mask or veil if you don't like it............\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, saying nothing. Once he had recovered his body, he should have a way to help Bai Yingying replenish her lost essence.\n\nActually,\n\nOn this matter, he was still in the wrong. His sympathy was overflowing, meddling with any ghost's call for help*.\n\nAlthough the ending was satisfactory, it was undeniable that during the process, he had fallen into someone's trap, putting those around him at risk and paying a huge price.\n\nHe could have simply opened a bookstore, been a ghost messenger, collected minor ghosts, read newspapers, and drunk coffee, leading a leisurely life. Yet, he didn't know how to cherish it, always wanting to be some great hero.\n\nZhou Ze chuckled self-deprecatingly, then said, \"Help me bathe.\"\n\n\"Mm, alright, Boss!\"\n\nEvery time Zhou Ze woke up from his paralysis, his first request was for her to help him bathe, because the boss was obsessive about cleanliness* and couldn't stand the feeling of being unclean.\n\nBai Yingying was very happy, as she felt that Zhou Ze's willingness to let her continue bathing him meant he hadn't disliked her.\n\nThis was an innocent and simple girl. Although she wasn't that simple, at least when she was with him, she truly was.\n\nSometimes Zhou Ze would recall the scene recorded by the camera in the old bookstore, where he saw Bai Yingying, after waking up, come down and stir his water cup with her tongue.\n\nThinking about it now,\n\nHe felt that she was a bit mischievous back then.\n\nPerhaps that's how people are: after spending a long time together and getting used to each other, they develop different perspectives on things.\n\nZhou Ze also seemed to have forgotten that when he first saw this scene in the surveillance video, he was scared half to death.\n\nBai Yingying carried Zhou Ze downstairs and into the bathroom. The old Daoist and Xu Qinglang weren't there. Bai Yingying said the old Daoist had gone to take his driving test, and Old Xu had returned to his hometown again.\n\nZhou Ze remembered Old Xu saying something had happened when he moved graves in his hometown last time, but Zhou Ze hadn't asked for details then, being busy with something, nor had Old Xu elaborated.\n\nAs for the Father, he was diligently cleaning. His Spider-Man costume had ripped in the last battle, so the old Daoist had bought him a few more outfits—Deadpool costumes.\n\nThe old Daoist said that style suited him, since he was someone whose skin was burned beyond recognition* anyway.\n\nSitting on a small stool in the bathroom, Bai Yingying carefully applied body wash to Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze had a lot of mud on his body, and it was obvious what it was without needing to think.\n\nBut this stuff was effective, especially miraculous for treating external injuries. Even with his obsessive cleanliness*, Zhou Ze could only hold his nose and accept it.\n\n\"Once my body recovers, I'll help you restore yourself,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Mm, thank you, Boss.\" Bai Yingying continued to rub his body, then said, \"Boss, there's not enough body wash. I'll go get some from outside.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nBai Yingying walked out of the bathroom.\n\nTurning his head slightly, Zhou Ze struggled to stand up. His bones all over his body emitted crackling sounds; this was due to being bedridden for too long.\n\nLooking at his stubbled face in the mirror, Zhou Ze suddenly felt a bit unfamiliar.\n\nHowever, this time seemed better than previous ones. He didn't know if it was because he had been lying down longer, but in any case, when he woke up this time, his external injuries had basically recovered. Of course, his body was still very weak.\n\nSo weak, that\n\nZhou Ze's foot suddenly slipped,\n\nAnd he fell directly,\n\nZhou Ze instinctively put his arm down first, attempting to counteract the momentum.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe pain after falling wasn't as distinct,\n\nJust as Zhou Ze felt a bit surprised,\n\nHe suddenly saw black armor appear on his arm, which had absorbed the impact of his fall.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up again,\n\nReaching out to touch this suddenly appearing piece of armor, he found that it seemed to be grown onto his arm. If he tried to tear it off, that part of him might become a bloody mess.\n\nZhou Ze looked at himself in the mirror again,\n\nThen silently took two steps back,\n\nSlightly raising his head,\n\nThe next moment,\n\nA set of black Japanese samurai armor slowly emerged from various parts of Zhou Ze's body,\n\nEnveloping his entire being,\n\nIn the enclosed bathroom,\n\nGusts of chilling wind immediately began to blow............\n---\n*Literally \"smash pots and sell iron,\" meaning to sell off all one's possessions, spare no expense.\n*Literally \"rotten old man,\" a self-deprecating or slightly derogatory term.\n*Literally \"stealing chickens and sneaking dogs.\"\n*Literally \"solitary body.\"\n*A term historically used in China to denote traditional beliefs and practices considered unscientific or backward.\n*Literally \"three-inch tongue that doesn't rot,\" meaning highly eloquent or persuasive.\n*A family with a long history of practicing Daoism.\n*Literally \"one generation not as good as the last.\"\n*Literally \"a character not in the mainstream/not of any rank.\"\n*Literally \"went underground and met the ancestral generations.\"\n*Literally \"lost her heart and gone crazy,\" implying extreme obsession or irrationality.\n*Literally \"bachelor in both [lives].\"\n*A gaming term referring to a character's innate abilities or talents, here used humorously to imply an inherent, almost instinctive trait.\n*Literally \"hollowed out\" or \"emptied.\"\n*Literally \"caring about what ghost calls.\" Implies getting involved where one shouldn't.\n*潔癖 (jiépì) literally means \"cleanliness obsession,\" a strong need for cleanliness or an aversion to dirt.\n*Meaning, someone whose charred flesh makes them unpresentable.",

    "content": "This set of armor's main materials were bamboo, leather, and some metal parts; it was entirely black and exquisitely crafted, making it pleasing to the eye.\n\nIn truth, Japanese samurai armor, when compared to armor from other countries of the same period, could not be considered the best, whether in terms of defense or practicality. This was because for a long time, the Japanese closed their doors and played their village chief-level \"Warring States period\" on their own islands.¹\n\nBut putting aside a series of shortcomings,\n\nThe key was, it looked good!\n\nEven Zhou Ze, at this moment, when he looked at himself in the mirror, wrapped in the armor, felt no discomfort or anger from suddenly having this thing on his body. Instead, he felt that, putting aside the practical and defensive aspects of this armor, just appearing suddenly during a fight would make him feel very \"cool and flashy.\"\n\nIf there were an old Taoist priest next to him to provide a classic BGM at the right moment, the effect would be even better.\n\nPerhaps influenced by modern Japanese cultural products, at least for Zhou Ze, he really didn't dislike this set of armor.\n\nZhou Ze still remembered when he was a child in the orphanage. After dinner, a large group of children would precisely gather in the living room, which had the only television in the whole school. Everyone sat together on small stools, waiting to watch cartoons.\n\nAt that time, VCRs, as well as VCDs and DVDs of later generations, were not yet widespread, so basically, everyone watched whatever was shown on TV.\n\nFor a period, a Japanese anime *Yoroiden Samurai Troopers* was a hit across the entire mainland, stirring up a huge craze. Even looking at it from today's perspective, this anime still doesn't feel outdated or old-fashioned in its armor design and the use of some *chūnibyō*² BGM.\n\nReaching out,\nRaising a leg,\nTwisting his waist,\nEven though he felt a bit weak now, Zhou Ze still insisted on striking a few poses in front of the mirror, quite like an old man indulging in youthful madness.³\n\nWhen he had played enough, Zhou Ze closed his eyes, the armor quickly disappeared. He let out a long breath, sat back down, already drenched in sweat.\n\nBai Yingying also brought shower gel and re-entered the bathroom at this moment. Seeing Zhou Ze sweating again, she didn't understand why, and could only help Zhou Ze wash himself again.\n\nEnjoying the service of his maid, Boss Zhou, having showered and changed into clean clothes, was helped by Bai Yingying to sit on his favorite spot on the sofa.\n\nOn the coffee table in front of him was a plate of candy, along with coffee and a newspaper.\n\nA leisurely afternoon should be spent wasting time.\n\nBoss Zhou quickly slipped into the role of a \"salted fish\"⁴ again. Perhaps, this was just his nature. Moreover, after the last incident, Zhou Ze began to instinctively reject any activity that required him to leave the bookstore.\n\nHis personality was a bit selfish, quite like, \"I'll just be a salted fish to my heart's content, even if the floods come after I die from being salty.\"⁵\n\nThe old Taoist priest returned at this moment, drenched in sweat. Seeing Zhou Ze leaning on the sofa reading a newspaper, the old Taoist priest excitedly \"hehe-ed\" twice, immediately grabbed a bottle of iced beer, came over, and said:\n\n\"Boss, coming home and seeing you sitting here reading the newspaper like usual, it feels really good.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest's implication was,\nLike a husband who had toiled hard all day outside, returning home to see his wife nursing their child, and all his fatigue vanished.\n\nAnyway, that statement sounded strange.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the old Taoist priest, seeing him full of vigor and walking with sturdy steps. He suddenly felt a bit envious of this fellow. After that incident, even though the old Taoist priest had Bai Yingying's corpse elixir to prolong his life, it only ensured he wouldn't die. He hadn't expected the old Taoist priest's vitality to be truly tenacious; how long had it been, and he was already recovered.\n\nA seventy-year-old man, possessing such terrifying vitality, and still able to \"stand tall like a pillar\"⁶ in the morning, constantly thinking about trivial or inappropriate things — truly enviable to others.\n\n\"How's your body?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nNo matter what, he still had to show some concern, even though Zhou Ze felt the old Taoist priest could probably \"play one dragon with two phoenixes\"⁷ all night long without any issue.\n\n\"Very good, I feel even sturdier than before.\" The old Taoist priest patted his chest and sat down next to Zhou Ze, then secretly pointed at Bai Yingying, who was busy behind them, and whispered:\n\n\"Boss, can you resolve Yingying's matter?\"\n\n\"I'll resolve it once I've fully recovered.\"\n\n\"That's good, she's a very pretty girl.\" The old Taoist priest smacked his lips, went to the bathroom, then came out, turned on the large TV, and randomly flipped through channels.\n\n\"Yo, Boss, there's a ball game today, want to watch?\"\n\n\"Not interested.\" Zhou Ze wasn't a sports fan.\n\n\"Tongcheng Zhiyun's game, it seems they're playing a Chinese Super League team, it's the FA Cup, right?\nA China League Two team playing a Chinese Super League team, oh, that's very rare. Let me take a look, this humble Taoist priest will watch.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest wasn't really a sports fan either, but he did have some connection with soccer teams. In earlier years, when he traveled extensively, he was invited to many soccer club home stadiums to perform rituals, meaning to \"consecrate\" the team's home stadium and turn their luck around.\n\nPerhaps those teams were a bit unlucky, their home stadium shots always hit the goalpost or they had various bad luck. Anyway, the old Taoist priest was like a \"blind cat catching a dead mouse\"⁸; or perhaps the players felt their home stadium had been consecrated and blessed, changing their psychological state. Their home performance suddenly improved, and the old Taoist priest became very popular because of this. After making a name for himself, he was invited by several other clubs to perform rituals.\n\nTo say that Chinese people are truly superstitious, there actually aren't many. Don't look at how prosperous the incense offerings are in temples, but people just go for the lively atmosphere. They bow and pray as soon as they enter a temple, with a \"cast a wide net\"⁹ mentality. Moreover, this actually can't be considered superstition. Before the start of construction on a building or the filming of a TV series/movie, a sacrificial altar is typically set up and incense offered to seek good fortune.\n\nHowever, the old Taoist priest overdid it a few years ago and created a butterfly effect: if you invited a Taoist priest here, I'd invite a \"divine medium\"¹⁰ or a monk. In short, \"when your side finishes singing, my side takes the stage,\"¹¹ all sorts of deities came to bless them, fully showcasing the local cultural industry characteristics of various clubs. How lively it was!\n\nHowever, this was captured by fans and became a sensation online. The fans themselves were just teasing, but it was noticed by the higher-ups. The Football Association immediately issued a document, prohibiting clubs from engaging in such activities again.\n\nBecause of this, the old Taoist priest's path to wealth was cut off, and he could only switch to the live-streaming industry, but that's a story for another time.\n\n…………\n\nXu Qinglang didn't drive back to his hometown; he took shared rides both ways. When he had finished his business in his hometown and was taking a shared ride back, he saw that the driver seemed to be secretly scrutinizing him the whole way.\n\nOh well.\nXu Qinglang was already quite used to such scrutiny, and somewhat immune to it. He was well aware of his own appearance and demeanor, and there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nBut the driver seemed a bit off, constantly taking out his phone to look at it, and deliberately looking at him again in the rearview mirror. Finally, the driver couldn't resist asking:\n\n\"Are you a cross-dresser?\"¹²\n\nXu Qinglang didn't understand what he meant for a moment.\n\nThe driver shook his head, then looked at his phone screen again, and asked, \"Are you male or female, after all?\"\n\n\"Male.\"\nXu Qinglang then pointed at the driver and said, \"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\n\"Tell me, what are you looking at.\" Xu Qinglang said firmly.\n\nNot to mention the overbearing aura of someone with more than twenty sets,\nJust the temperament cultivated from experiencing and seeing so much recently,\nWhen Xu Qinglang spoke now, it was as if he carried an Empress Wu Zetian-like oppressive presence.\n\nThe driver was probably young, his psychological resilience not like that of an old hand.¹³ In his nervousness, he actually pointed directly at the screen and said:\n\n\"We have driver ratings here, which passengers can't see;\nI saw in the reviews here that you're very beautiful, and some people were guessing whether you're male or female, etc. I took your order earlier because I saw this review and was interested, so I immediately accepted the ride; actually, your route and my route are quite different.\"\n\n\"Boring.\"\nXu Qinglang shook his head disdainfully and closed his eyes.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, the car arrived at the bookstore entrance. Xu Qinglang got out and saw that there were quite a few people inside the bookstore, and they were live people.\n\nPushing open the door, he walked in. Xu Qinglang saw Zhou Ze sitting at the bar.\n\n\"You're awake.\" Xu Qinglang greeted.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why is it so lively?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the big TV screen and said, \"At first, the old Taoist priest was watching a ball game, then many passersby saw it through the glass window, and came in to watch together.\"\n\n\"Spend a hundred yuan just to come in and watch a ball game?\" Xu Qinglang found it a bit hard to understand.\n\nActually, Tongcheng had not had a professional soccer team for a long time, but after getting one two years ago, it immediately attracted many fans. Even for China League Two matches, nearly ten thousand people would go to watch the game live each time; its popularity had already surpassed some Chinese Super League teams.\n\n\"Holy crap, two-nil down! Damn it, I'm not watching anymore!\"\nA middle-aged man with many tattoos cursed and yelled a few times, finally, very reluctantly, he went to the bar counter to pay the bill.\n\n\"What a rip-off! I only asked for two Sprites, and you charged me a hundred! And damn it, they were two goals down in the first half! I'm really just paying to suffer!\"\n\nThe tattooed man thought for a moment, then took back the hundred yuan he was about to put out, and said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Boss, how can you have the nerve to charge me? I also hang around here, my nickname's Brother Qiang. If you ever need anything, just give me a shout...\"\n\n\"No charge.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe tattooed man \"hehe-ed\" and smiled, extended a finger and pointed at Zhou Ze, signaling that he was \"sensible.\" In reality, someone who could open a shop on South Street was long beyond being criticized by such an outwardly strong but inwardly weak ruffian.\n\nThe tattooed man pulled out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, and lit it, then coolly pushed open the bookstore door and walked out.\n\n\"Doesn't know what's coming to him.\" Xu Qinglang sneered from the side.\n\nHe understood why Zhou Ze would suddenly be kind enough not to charge him; it was definitely not because he was threatened.\n\nWhat a joke!\nA ghost messenger threatened by a terrestrial ruffian of yours – would he still be able to \"mix it up\"?\n\nPlus, with Boss Zhou's miserly, Grandet-like personality¹⁴, would he have a problem with money?\n\nIn fact, Xu Qinglang had also seen that the tattooed hoodlum had a darkened glabella¹⁵, and faint black aura surrounded him. Clearly, he had recently attracted something unclean. If no one with spiritual attainment helped him avert the disaster, he would, at best, suffer a serious illness, and at worst, might get into a car accident while walking on the road.\n\nThe money of a dying man, might as well not take it then. Maybe in a few days, his ghost would still come to the bookstore. If he couldn't collect money from him while he was alive, he could still collect it after he died. Anyway, Boss Zhou was \"sitting steadily on the fishing platform.\"¹⁶\n\nZhou Ze silently lit a cigarette.\n\nThe exterior of the bookstore was all glass, so the tattooed man who had just walked out could be clearly seen from inside.\n\nThe tattooed man took a deep drag from his cigarette, walked out, and just as he was about to exhale,\nA pregnant woman happened to walk past him.\n\nThe tattooed man looked at the woman's pregnant belly and immediately forced himself to hold back that puff of smoke. Smokers all know the \"sour and refreshing\"¹⁷ feeling of swallowing a mouthful of smoke; it was like swallowing half a mouthful of mustard.\n\nBoss Zhou exhaled a smoke ring, and Xu Qinglang, who was beside him, also saw this scene.\n\n\"Go and help him break it.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n___\n¹ \"Village chief-level 'Warring States period'\" (村長級別的「戰國時代」): A sarcastic remark comparing the internal conflicts of isolated Japan to petty squabbles, rather than grand wars, during its historical Sengoku (Warring States) period.\n² *Chūnibyō* (中二病): Also known as \"eighth-grade syndrome,\" a Japanese slang term describing teenagers who have delusions of grandeur, believing they have hidden powers or knowledge, leading to overly dramatic or grandiose behavior.

    "content": "「Hey, stop!」\n\nXu Qinglang pushed open the bookstore door and yelled at the tattooed man who had just finished coughing in front.\n\nThe tattooed man froze, turned sideways, still holding that cigarette in his mouth. He looked at Xu Qinglang with a leering amusement in his eyes and said:\n\n「Buddy, I've been wanting to say this, you're really good-looking. Did you get that done in Thailand?」\n\n「............」 Xu Qinglang.\n\n「Buddy, anything? You're not here to get that hundred kuai back, are you? Let me tell you, your boss said himself it was on the house, so don't even think about getting it from me. When you run a business, isn't integrity the most important thing?」\n\nThe tattooed man gave off an air of \"I'm so awesome.\"\n\n「Nothing. Just came out to say goodnight.」\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head naturally, turned around, and went back into the bookstore, without taking half a cloud[^1].\n\nGoodnight?\n\nThe tattooed man paused, muttering to himself, *Could this guy be into me?*\n\n*I'm a very upright person, you know,*\n\n*But this guy is so pretty,*\n\n*Maybe it's excusable to bend a little occasionally, right?*\n\n*Doesn't a man have to be adaptable and flexible?*\n\nThe tattooed man kept dramatizing the situation for himself, unaware that his foul mouth had made him lose a lifeline.\n\nZhou Ze saw Xu Qinglang go out and come back quickly, somewhat surprised:\n\n「What's wrong?」\n\n「Nothing.」 Xu Qinglang walked behind the counter, mixing himself a cocktail. 「Too lazy to save him now.」\n\n「Oh.」\n\nZhou Ze replied with a sound and said nothing more.\n\nIf you're not related, and they find you pleasing to the eye, they'll give you a hand—it's just a small gesture.\n\nIf they don't like the look of you, turning a blind eye is also understandable.\n\nIn fact, Old Xu was a very positive person at first. He used to persuade Zhou Ze to help people, and Zhou Ze was quite annoyed with him back then.\n\nNow, Xu Qinglang has not only been influenced by Zhou Ze into a lethargic[^2] state in his lifestyle, but he's also become much more indifferent in this regard.\n\nPerhaps it's because he's seen too many wandering souls and their tragic stories; when you see too much of anything, you become numb.\n\nIn the first half, the Tongcheng Ziyun Team was already two goals behind, which led to more than half of the audience here leaving at once. Most people were just there for the spectacle, supporting their hometown team based on their natural preference. But seeing their team two goals down in the first half, and it being a lower-tier league team playing a Chinese Super League (CSL) team, everyone felt it was hopeless and didn't want to watch anymore.\n\nHowever, two middle-aged men sitting next to Zhou Ze had been watching with great interest. One wore a red shirt, sitting there watching without saying a word from beginning to end.\n\nThe other leaned against the side of the bar, holding a briefcase and propped up by a crutch.\n\nNeither of these two men was actually very old, only around forty.\n\n「No hope, no hope.」\n\nThe middle-aged man with the crutch sighed regretfully.\n\nTwo young people nearby glared at him impatiently. Clearly, they felt that at this moment, it was fine if he didn't watch, but to spread negativity here was extremely annoying.\n\nThe middle-aged man didn't get angry, continuing to drink the cocktail in his hand. It was a 98 kuai cocktail. After coming in, the middle-aged man had specifically asked for the price, feeling that ordering ice water wouldn't let him get his money's worth, but this one could basically cover the minimum spend, so it wasn't a loss.\n\nIn fact, he was someone who calculated every penny. For such a person to be willing to walk into a \"rip-off joint\"[^3] with a minimum spend of a hundred kuai was truly surprising.\n\nHe himself didn't know why, but while running errands, he passed by here, happened to see a game being broadcast inside, and inexplicably[^4] walked in and sat down.\n\n「Only two goals behind, it's not that bad, is it?」 Zhou Ze said.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't a football fan, but he'd watched the first half. The two teams had actually played back and forth, but the Tongcheng team had bad luck, letting the Chinese Super League team score two. The opportunities were actually equal.\n\n「It's different, it's different,」 the middle-aged man took a sip of his drink and explained like an expert commentator: 「Actually, it's inevitable for Chinese Super League teams to feel a bit unaccustomed at first when playing China League Two teams.\n\nBecause according to the Chinese Football Association (CFA) regulations, China League Two has no foreign players, it's all Chinese players. But the CSL has foreign players, and in recent years, more and more capital magnates have entered the CSL, buying stronger and stronger foreign players, even big-name stars in their prime.\n\nSo, Chinese Super League teams, whether in matches or training, have a serious reliance on foreign players. Suddenly playing without foreign players, they're a bit unaccustomed. China League Two teams, having no foreign players, play as they normally do, so their coordination might actually be better.\n\nTherefore, the first half was key for an upset. But after one half, the CSL teams can adapt to the rhythm of playing without foreign players. Plus, the Chinese players in CSL teams are inherently much stronger than those in China League Two. They often play better in the second half than in the first.\n\nNow, the problem is, this China League Two team, in the first half when they had their best chance, is already two goals down. They'll have even less of a chance in the second half. Moreover, this Chinese Super League team is the defending champion of the last CFA Cup; they won't let their guard down.」\n\nAfter the middle-aged man's lengthy analysis, he only got a silent nod from Zhou Ze. Suddenly feeling unsatisfied, he continued: 「Boss, trust me, this match, it's not turning around. Look at these young people, they're just making noise and stirring up excitement for nothing.」\n\nZhou Ze didn't commit. Coincidentally, Xu Qinglang had just mixed himself a drink, which Zhou Ze conveniently pushed over to the middle-aged man.\n\nThe middle-aged man accepted it with a chuckle, not being polite at all.\n\nIt seemed he had drunk a bit too much, as the middle-aged man occasionally thumped his瘸ed leg with his hand.\n\n「Were you an athlete before?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「Ah, yes.」 The middle-aged man revealed a look of reminiscence. 「Before, I also played football. But I wasn't as famous as General Fan or Big Gun Hao. I was just a small substitute, and the team I was on wasn't big. Now that team is gone too.」\n\n「What a pity.」\n\n「Nothing to pity, just bad luck.」 The middle-aged man pointed at the glass and said: 「Boss, if you waive this bill for me, I'll tell you a secret from the football world.」\n\n「Waived.」\n\n「Decisive.」 The middle-aged man sighed, saying: 「I didn't catch a good era. Back then, in the early 2000s, the football world was chaotic, and dark. Not like now. Now, as you know, these big bosses are all getting into football, with plenty of money and foolishness, and good benefits. Damn, they can easily earn tens of millions.」\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he was listening.\n\nBy this time, the second half of the match had also started. The few remaining spectators in the bookstore were still watching. Most people had already settled their bills and left during halftime.\n\n「It wasn't good for us back then. It wasn't about whether you wanted to or not; it was like that from top to bottom. Not to mention the big shots above, even club managers and head coaches played it this way. As a small player, what could you do?\n\nBack then, my skill level wasn't actually good enough to play in the Jia-A League[^5], but the general manager kept me on and paid my salary. I knew what his purpose was.」\n\n「That's how your leg got瘸ed?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe middle-aged man nodded. 「Haha, Boss, don't misunderstand, I wasn't瘸ed for refusing to play a fixed match. Damn, I was depressed to death about it.\n\nI remember that match, we were playing a mid-to-lower-table team. These kinds of matches were actually the easiest to fix, because everyone was mid-to-lower, so any result was normal, and outsiders wouldn't find it too surprising. Unlike those competing for the championship or AFC Champions League qualification, which had countless eyes on them.\n\nIn that match, the bookmaker sent me a notice, telling me to ensure a loss.\n\nLet me tell you, bookmakers usually don't bribe too many people on a team when fixing a match—maybe one here, one there, at most two. Especially bribing the defense is easy; letting in a goal or giving up a goal is too simple. It's impossible for everyone from top to bottom to be the bookmaker's people; first, the cost is high, and second, with more people, it's easier for leaks and problems to arise.\n\nWhat was unlucky about that match was that our team's foreign player performed too well, like he was on steroids. He scored two goals within the first ten minutes of the game.\n\nBookmakers generally don't dare to bribe foreign players. Foreign players can be replaced at any time, and if they go back to their home country and casually leak something to the media, what then?\n\nUnlike us locals, our roots and circles are all in the country, so bookmakers find it easier to control us and don't worry about us causing problems.\n\nIn that match, I kept letting players slip past and even gave away a penalty, finally allowing the opponent to score three goals in the 80th minute, letting them take the lead. It truly exhausted me to death.\n\nBefore the match ended, I, as a defensive midfielder, just ran upfront to play as a forward. I didn't want to defend anymore anyway.\n\nWho knew, by an unlucky coincidence, a long kick from our backfield passed through the opponent's defense and landed right in front of me.\n\nI was completely stunned at the time, but with the ball right in front of you, you couldn't not kick it, that would be too fake. So I symbolically kicked it, deliberately mishitting it. The ball was very slow, a shot even a goalkeeper could stop with their foot.\n\nBut damn it, the opposing goalkeeper seemed too nervous and actually fell. Then my shot, which even my grandma could save, just went in like that.\n\nWhen I saw that ball slowly rolling across the goal line, I was filled with despair.\n\nAfter the match, the bookmaker's people found me and瘸ed my leg. Heh, I wasn't a star player. Of course, star players back then also played fixed matches; weren't several of them imprisoned? But if I had some fame, they wouldn't dare treat me like that. Who told me I was just a small substitute in a small team back then? This leg was the price, because that goal of mine cost the bookmaker tens of millions. Tens of millions back then was a lot of money.」\n\nAt this moment, a burst of cheers came from the young people in front.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the screen; the Tongcheng team had pulled one back, now trailing 1-2.\n\n「Oh, they can still score one?」 The middle-aged man was somewhat surprised.\n\nLess than three minutes later,\n\nanother cheer,\n\nThey've equalized!\n\nThe score is level!\n\nThe middle-aged man suddenly stood up, a look of disbelief on his face.\n\n「Is it a fixed match?」 Zhou Ze asked.\n\n「No, it shouldn't be, and it can't be. That Chinese Super League team wouldn't want to lose. They're backed by a large conglomerate and wouldn't care for this little bit of gambling money.」\n\nAt this moment, the few young people in the bookstore kept shouting 'Go, go, score one more,' and so on.\n\nThen,\n\njust before the match ended,\n\nthe Tongcheng team actually scored another goal, taking the lead, and ultimately eliminated the Chinese Super League team two levels above them, creating a miracle and causing a huge upset.\n\nThe middle-aged man pursed his lips, smiled at Zhou Ze, then limped out of the bookstore with his crutch.\n\nSince Zhou Ze had waived his bill, he didn't pay.\n\nThe match ended, and everyone else in the bookstore left. However, the man in the red shirt remained seated. Throughout the entire match, he hadn't cheered or spoken, just sat there watching intently.\n\n「Hey, time to go.」 Zhou Ze reached out and patted the other man's shoulder. 「I let you watch a match for entertainment before you head to the Yellow Springs[^6]. Pretty good of me, huh?」\n\nThe red-shirted man froze, nodded, then looked at Zhou Ze, his lips twitching a few times. He said, 「The goalkeeper that瘸ed man was talking about earlier? That was me.」\n\nZhou Ze was slightly surprised to hear that.\n\n「That year, another small bookmaker and I were betting against the fixers, a classic 'dog eat dog' situation. I 'gifted' the opponent's foreign player two goals right at the start. Who knew that guy was even better at 'gifting' goals than me, and managed to 'gift' them the lead.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nIn the end, his shot was just too slow and too weak. I had no choice but to pretend to fall and let that ball go in.」\n\n「Are you guys playing a match or *Infernal Affairs*[^7]?」 Zhou Ze was speechless, then asked: 「How did you die?」\n\n「Died in a car accident.」 The red-shirted man shook his head helplessly. 「I'd been retired for over ten years. A while ago, I was driving, and near the flower beds by the road, some elementary school kids were playing football. A ball flew right towards me, hitting my car window. It startled me, and I turned the steering wheel the wrong way, entering the oncoming lane.\n\nThen I got into a car accident.\n\nIt was actually a minor accident. The minivan coming from the other direction was clearly driving very slowly, really very slowly, not fast at all;\n\nI just bumped my head a bit, and when I was sent to the hospital, there was nothing serious at first.\n\nThen, the day before I was set to be discharged, I inexplicably died in the hospital, from something like a concussion.\n\nYou tell me,\n\nisn't that ridiculous?」\n\n---\n[^1]: A Chinese idiom (不帶走半片雲彩) meaning to leave without a trace, or without taking anything with one.

    "content": "Zhou Ze wasn't sure if reincarnation truly existed in this world, or if so-called karmic retribution was real. But one thing was certain: those who committed many evils and greedily amassed ill-gotten gains would eventually receive their due punishment:\n\n  At the very least,\n\n  They would die of old age.\n\nHe opened the Gate of Hell, reached out, grabbed the red-shirted man, and directly threw him inside. One piece of business complete.\n\nAfterward, Zhou Ze re-entered his idle state¹, lying on the sofa, holding a newspaper, and drinking coffee. After the ups and downs of the Mirror World, Zhou Ze felt this current state was the most enjoyable.\n\nHe maintained this posture until evening, when Xu Qinglang walked over and whispered to Zhou Ze, \"There's no money left in the shop's account.\"\n\nThe bookstore's rent wasn't actually expensive, as it was rented from the Xu family, who had given them the green light during price negotiations.\n\nHowever, when factoring in everyone's food and drink, plus utility bills and so on, it wasn't a small sum. The coffee Boss Zhou was currently drinking was imported and already expensive. The liquor Xu Qinglang mixed for customers was cheap stuff from small bars, but what he drank himself was never cheap.\n\nMoreover, the bookstore's business with the living was indeed not very good. Just looking at how Zhou Ze hadn't bought any new books yet made it clear how unsatisfactory the bookstore's business truly was.\n\n\"Go get some joss paper and burn it at the entrance. Burn more.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went to get the joss paper. The old Daoist, who had been playing with the monkey, saw this and immediately came over as well.\n\nFor the old Daoist, there was no game in this world more fun than burning joss paper; it was more exhilarating than playing slot machines. Just squatting at the shop entrance to burn some, and soon someone would come by and throw money down – it was absolutely delightful.\n\n\"Get more,\" the old Daoist muttered from the side.\n\n\"That's enough,\" Xu Qinglang said, holding a stack.\n\n\"The boss said to burn more, what are you saving for him?\"\n\n\"That's enough, or it'll be too wasteful.\"\n\n\"Does his household need you to manage it?\" The old Daoist shook his head. \"If anyone's going to manage it, it's Yingying.\"\n\nXu Qinglang thought about it; it seemed indeed to be the case. He simply took out another stack and handed it to the old Daoist. Then, Xu Qinglang and the old Daoist each took a stack of money, and under the cover of night, lit it right at the bookstore's entrance.\n\nAfter burning it, the old Daoist squatted nearby, smoking, waiting for RMB to come in.\n\nIn truth, the old Daoist had quite a stash of joss paper himself. Sometimes, when encountering ghosts with no money, Zhou Ze wouldn't even bother with a few sheets of underworld currency and would just reward them to the old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist hid them away, overjoyed. Accumulating small amounts also added up to a considerable sum.\n\nMoreover, the old Daoist had a dream: once he accumulated enough underworld currency, he would tape them all together to make a garment, just like the fish-skin clothes of the Hezhe people, and wear it.\n\nDamn, by then he would truly be a living good omen! Just thinking about it made him excited.\n\nIf he wore that outfit to Macau, wouldn't he be infallible?\n\nAn electric bike drove up from the front. Both the old Daoist and Xu Qinglang's gazes turned to it. They both thought, *that must be him.*\n\nThe person on the electric bike wore a blue delivery uniform and a helmet, clearly a delivery driver. The delivery driver hadn't thought anything of it initially, but as he passed the bookstore, he suddenly saw a man and a woman squatting at the entrance, staring straight at him. His heart immediately seized up. Coincidentally, there was a fire hydrant ahead, and he actually drove straight into it.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nA small box fell off, filled with takeout containers.\n\nThe delivery driver immediately stood up, looking somewhat guilty. He quickly righted his electric bike, seemingly not even noticing the fallen items, and drove directly onto the road.\n\n\"Honk honk………………\"\n\nCar horns blared.\n\nUnder the gaze of the old Daoist and Xu Qinglang,\n\nThe delivery driver, like a reckless fool, crashed directly into the bus ahead, a head-on collision.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe delivery driver was thrown flying.\n\nHis electric bike also fell apart.\n\nHis helmet, by unfortunate coincidence, rolled right in front of the old Daoist and Xu Qinglang, tumbling and wobbling a few times.\n\nThis seemed to have gotten out of hand.\n\nXu Qinglang and the old Daoist exchanged glances, both seeing a hint of helplessness in the other's eyes.\n\n\"I told you to burn less,\" Xu Qinglang grumbled.\n\n\"Damn it, you're the one who took it,\"\n\nThe old Daoist retorted irritably. He then stood up, picked up the meal the delivery driver had just dropped, and upon holding it, immediately felt something was off. He promptly pulled Xu Qinglang into the bookstore.\n\n\"What happened outside? A car accident?\" Zhou Ze was also disturbed by the commotion outside.\n\nThe old Daoist brought the takeout containers over, took a deep breath, and opened the first one in front of Zhou Ze. Inside, astonishingly, was a full stash of money – and it was US dollars!\n\n\"Ooh, my goodness.\"\n\nThe old Daoist smacked his lips, then immediately opened two more boxes. Inside, astonishingly, were still US dollars.\n\n\"We're rich, we're rich!\" The old Daoist couldn't control his hands and immediately opened the last takeout container. Then he let out a cry and quickly stepped back. The last container, surprisingly, held a bag of small blue pills.\n\nIt's over, it's over, we're finished, it's pills!²\n\nXu Qinglang stood by, not particularly excited by the sight of the US dollars. It was less than a hundred thousand US dollars, which converted to only a few hundred thousand RMB – not even enough for one of his apartments.\n\nBut when Xu Qinglang saw the blue pills, a look of surprise also appeared on his face.\n\n\"Who left these?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A delivery driver,\" the old Daoist replied.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"There, the one who got into the car accident outside, he was thrown flying,\" the old Daoist pointed outside.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, walked to the doorway, and looked. Quite a few onlookers³ had already gathered at the accident scene, but he could still see through the gaps that the delivery driver was lying on the ground, bleeding profusely, likely not going to make it.\n\n\"Go burn some more joss paper at the entrance. Don't cause trouble,\" Zhou Ze instructed the old Daoist.\n\n\"Got it.\" The old Daoist wiped the sweat from his forehead and immediately went to the drawer to take out a few sheets of underworld currency, which he burned at the entrance. This time, it wasn't for wealth, but to avoid trouble.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the US dollars on the table, signaling Xu Qinglang to put them away as household expenses for this period. Then he picked up the bag containing the blue pills and walked to the bathroom.\n\n\"Flush!…………\"\n\nZhou Ze directly poured the entire bag of small blue pills into the toilet, then flushed it. The small pills went down the drain.\n\nIn fact, this bag of pills might have been worth more, but Boss Zhou was unmoved. Just like the father and son eating steamed buns last time, if a living person touched this kind of stuff, it would harm their spiritual merit and bring misfortune upon their descendants. Even ghosts weren't willing to touch it.\n\nAfter doing all this, Zhou Ze clapped his hands and walked out.\n\nPolice and ambulances quickly arrived. The delivery driver's accident was quite severe; he died instantly. Initially, not many police came, treating it as a regular car accident, but later, many, many more police arrived, and the atmosphere instantly changed.\n\nZhou Ze guessed that the police had probably identified the delivery driver's true identity and started a major investigation. Police also came to the bookstore to take witness statements, which the old Daoist handled.\n\nAfterward, the old Daoist chuckled, \"He really was a drug dealer. We just burned some underworld currency at our own entrance and ended up carrying out divine justice.\"\n\n\"His discarded items?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"We're lucky, or maybe the underworld currency we burned afterward worked. Both cameras here had a wiring issue today and went on strike, so we can use those US dollars ourselves.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze nodded. Money obtained from burning underworld currency was basically ill-gotten gains, so he had no psychological burden using it himself.\n\n\"Hey, Deadpool, come clean up.\"\n\nThe priest, dressed in a Deadpool outfit, stood up from where he was sitting, took the mop from the old Daoist's hand, and began cleaning.\n\nThe old Daoist didn't remain idle either, beginning to arrange the tables and chairs and clear the coffee table.\n\nBecause the boss was obsessive about cleanliness⁴, this kind of cleaning had to be done once daily.\n\nZhou Ze went upstairs. Bai Yingying was already in the bedroom, sitting on a chair, watching a movie with headphones on.\n\nActually, Bai Yingying's appearance had mostly recovered lately, but that was only on the surface. Her internal depletion could only be restored by Zhou Ze after his own body had recovered.\n\nYet, as she sat there, with her white hair flowing down and her feet propped on the desk, she exuded a serene tranquility, more so than her previous liveliness.\n\nEspecially her small feet, constantly gently flexing and extending, as if they could captivate souls.\n\nBeautiful curves, perfectly proportioned arches.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't help but stand at the doorway, watching for a while longer. People always harbored an urge to appreciate beautiful things.\n\n\"Boss, boss! This isn't good, it's not good!\"\n\nThe old Daoist ran up, holding something in his hand.\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\nBai Yingying took off her headphones and came over as well.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, this is what I found under the chair, a card tucked among a few sheets of underworld currency.\"\n\nGenerally, after escorting a ghost to the underworld, the \"toll money\" left behind by the ghost would usually be on the ground or stuck to the underside of the chair the ghost had been sitting on. The old Daoist paid special attention to these spots when cleaning.\n\nBut this was the first time a small card was found tucked within underworld currency. The card was black, unlike those things slipped under hotel doors at night.\n\nThe card felt a bit cold to the touch. Two lines of text were engraved on it:\n\n\"Welcome to Lost Town, a new haven for the deceased.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. A new haven for the deceased?\n\nThe deceased's destination should be Hell. How did a town suddenly appear here?\n\n\"Boss, they're stealing our business!\" the old Daoist directly shouted.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Yes, they were indeed stealing business.\n\n\"No wonder not a single ghost came to the door while you were unconscious, Boss. I thought it was strange,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\nBoss Zhou enjoyed lying in the bookstore, reading newspapers, drinking coffee, and being a slacker, but that was predicated on spirits coming daily to deliver business and underworld currency. Now that someone was stealing business, Boss Zhou naturally couldn't afford to be magnanimous and ignore it.\n\nFurthermore, according to the rules of the Underworld, each area in the mortal realm had a corresponding underworld envoy responsible for it. Within that area, the underworld envoy held a monopoly on the local ghost delivery industry. Once a monopoly was established and accustomed to, if any competition emerged, the monopolizer would instinctively choose to absorb and suppress it, rather than thinking about improving service or increasing their own competitiveness.\n\nJust like Boss Zhou at this moment, who didn't even consider developing new activities in his own bookstore to attract spirits. Instead, he instinctively opted for a more direct and brutal approach.\n\n\"Call Lin Ke. We're heading out at three in the morning.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. The little loli also had to contribute to this matter. All along, while Zhou Ze ate meat, the little loli could drink the soup and still see her performance improve. This time, the unknown competitor was essentially ruining their shared business.\n\n\"Go out and talk it over with them?\" the old Daoist asked.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Daoist, smiled, and said,\n\n\"Take them out.\"\n\nAnyone who interferes with my idleness is a heretic and must be decisively dealt with!\n\nThose who hinder my idleness, die!\n\n---\n¹ `idle state` (鹹魚狀態, xiányú zhuàngtài): Literally \"salted fish state,\" an internet slang term describing a state of being utterly unmotivated, lazy, or resigned to a non-active lifestyle.\n² `it's pills!` (藥丸了!, yàowán le!): A pun in Chinese, where the word for \"pill\" (藥丸, yàowán) sounds similar to \"it's over\" or \"it's done for\" (要完, yàowán). The phrase implies that the situation is finished or doomed.\n³ `onlookers` (吃瓜群眾, chīguā qúnzhòng): Literally \"melon-eating crowd,\" an internet slang term referring to people who spectate a dramatic event or gossip without getting involved.\n⁴ `obsessive about cleanliness` (潔癖, jiépǐ): Can be translated as \"germaphobia\" or \"cleanliness obsession.\" Here, it refers to a strong preference for cleanliness rather than a clinical phobia.",

    "content": "Calling Little Loli was also because Zhou Ze operated on the principle that \"if a lackey can be used, use them; if not, it's a waste.\" Anyway, her soul blood was with him, so he didn't need to play any tricks of showing sympathy for subordinates. Plus, ever since they met, Little Loli had treated him as a consumable to be used up and destroyed, so there was no need for any warmth.\n\nWhen he needed her, he'd call her over and use her ruthlessly.\n\nUse her up and then discard her, each going their own way. When he needed her again, another call, and she'd still have to be on call.\n\nDid Boss Zhou really not know that Little Loli had actually been hoping for him to die for a long time?\n\nLet her hope if she wants to. Someone who's died once really doesn't care about such taboos.\n\nWalking out of the bookstore, Zhou Ze was somewhat surprised to find that a new private kitchen restaurant had opened right next door to his bookstore. It was called \"Wang Fuju Private Kitchen,\" probably opened during the half-month he was unconscious.\n\nThere happened to be an old man standing at the entrance. Bald, wearing white clothes, younger than the Old Daoist, probably only around fifty. He looked like one of those elderly folks who go out to practice Tai Chi in the morning.\n\nAt 3 AM, he was actually still sitting at the shop entrance. A rattan chair, a pot of tea, sitting there drinking by himself.\n\n\"Oh, you're Boss Zhou, aren't you? You're back!\"\n\nThe old man was naturally friendly and recognized Zhou Ze. It seemed he had gotten quite familiar with the others in the bookstore during Zhou Ze's unconsciousness, but he always knew there was a boss in the shop who was like a \"divine dragon, showing its tail but not its head\"* – rarely seen.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that the boss had actually been in the shop all along, just unconscious.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. Opening a private kitchen restaurant in a place like South Street, where every inch of land is as precious as gold, inherently suggested a certain cachet. Many private kitchen restaurants were very arrogant, explicitly telling you how many tables they'd serve today, and that they'd rest on holidays. If you wanted to come, you'd have to wait and slowly queue.\n\nBut this boss was overly enthusiastic towards him, even obsequious.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze quickly figured it out. Presumably, in this boss's eyes, someone who opened a bookstore that would definitely lose money in such an expensive and prime location like South Street must have a significant background.\n\nEither he was a fool, or a big shot with too much money to spend, simply playing with sentimentality.\n\nAfter the boss saw Zhou Ze, he ruled out the former possibility, because Zhou Ze clearly didn't look like a fool.\n\nThe other party handed him a business card and a cigarette. Zhou Ze waved his hand, indicating he understood. The boss, being perceptive, said to come eat at his place sometime and then left.\n\n\"The owner of this place is good.\"\n\nXu Qinglang also came out at this moment, having changed his clothes.\n\nZhou Ze neither confirmed nor denied.\n\n\"You're a bit annoyed with him?\"\n\n\"Heh heh, would you be very happy to wake up after a sleep and find an 'Old Wang Next Door'* has appeared?\"\n\nXu Qinglang yawned.\n\n\"But you should be quite happy. People who open private kitchen restaurants usually have some special skills or something, didn't you go chat with him?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Grease and smoke are bad for the skin, so I didn't go,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, sighing inwardly, \"The world is degenerating, people's hearts are no longer what they used to be.\" The diligent and hard-working Xu Qinglang who used to run a noodle shop had long since vanished into the winds of memory.\n\nBut then he thought, it seemed Xu Qinglang had become like this after meeting him. Could this also be a case of \"near vermilion, one turns red; near ink, one turns black\"*?\n\nThinking about it more carefully, he was clearly a very diligent and hardworking person in his previous life. How was it that after dying once, he was like a punctured ball,\n\nCompletely deflated.\n\nLittle Loli arrived, still carrying her schoolbag, standing angrily across the street. Under the dim streetlights, at a street corner in the early morning, such a fresh and lively little girl suddenly appearing there would bring not surprise, but fright.\n\nXu Qinglang drove, Zhou Ze got into the front passenger seat. Little Loli got in, still looking angry.\n\nYingying had better rest now and not go out. The Old Daoist was at home watching the shop, so Zhou Ze just dragged Xu Qinglang along as a driver.\n\nWith the experience from the last time at the hot spring hotel, Zhou Ze was now cautious. There was no need to drag a large group of people along for everything, lest he not die himself but instead cause them to have an accident, making him feel bad.\n\nNo address was written on the card, but when Zhou Ze ran his finger over it, he could sense a location. The departed souls didn't need to look; they could sense it too.\n\nZhou Ze gave directions, Xu Qinglang drove. About twenty minutes later, the car arrived at a small town on the outskirts of Gangzha District.\n\nGetting out of the car, they saw field ridges ahead. Wheat seedlings stretched out in a continuous expanse, dotted with a few houses.\n\nThe location was here; it should be correct.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, wanting to ask Little Loli to get out and look around with him. But he found Little Loli sitting in the back seat doing homework.\n\n\"Knock knock knock............\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and tapped on the car window.\n\nHe really wanted to ask, \"Are you here to make a joke?\"\n\nLittle Loli, annoyed, closed her homework and said:\n\n\"She has a lot of homework, and I happened to be awake, so I just helped her finish this week's assignments, so she could be a bit more relaxed.\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze slightly narrowed. At this moment, he thought of the female ghost messenger who had possessed his sister-in-law. She must have had this kind of problem, where the host's thoughts affected her, causing her to be somewhat mentally confused.\n\nThis seemed to be a common problem. Would all ghost messengers who chose to reside their souls in living bodies be affected?\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't say much more. He was here to cause trouble* today; he didn't have the leisure to chat with Little Loli about life philosophies.\n\nPushing open the car door, Little Loli stretched, took a deep breath, and then said:\n\n\"I don't feel anything.\"\n\n\"How's your performance been lately?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Very bad,\" Little Loli replied.\n\nZhou Ze took out the black card and examined it carefully for a while. Then he looked up and around, saying, \"Is it because we all have bodies, so we can't find that place?\"\n\n\"Or perhaps they sensed we were coming, so they hid themselves in advance?\" Little Loli shrugged, took the card from Zhou Ze's hand, and continued, \"Just like those small cards slipped under hotel room doors, they'll also change locations and phone numbers after a while. Is it to avoid anti-prostitution raids?\"\n\nZhou Ze thought Little Loli's words made a lot of sense. But returning empty-handed like this, Zhou Ze was truly unwilling. Who knew, the moment he left, that small town might open for business again.\n\nIf he lay in the bookstore day and night and couldn't even see a single ghost, how could he continue to live so leisurely?\n\nTo put it lightly, this affected his future quality of life.\n\nTo put it seriously, this was a loss of state-owned assets for the Underworld.\n\n\"You didn't feel anything?\"\n\nXu Qinglang turned around and asked.\n\nIt was then that Zhou Ze noticed Xu Qinglang still had a talisman pasted on his forehead. The last time Xu Qinglang entered Sanxiang Village, he also had this pasted on, and it was the same one when the Old Daoist induced a ghost to possess him.\n\nThis was considered the simplest kind of talisman. Anyone with even a little bit of spiritual cultivation could use it.\n\nIt was like health supplements.\n\nHealth supplements that could truly make your body better and reduce your illness were extremely difficult to come by, one in a thousand.\n\nBut health supplements that just made you feel a bit full, with no benefit and no harm, were easy to get; the market was basically full of these.\n\nAs for things that could make you sick or even directly kick the bucket after eating them, those were even simpler.\n\nThis talisman was for living people to reduce their Yang energy. It belonged to the last type of health supplement.\n\n\"What did you see?\" Zhou Ze asked curiously.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed ahead. Zhou Ze looked in that direction; there was a grave mound, not very noticeable. There were also many small colorful flags stuck in front of the grave mound.\n\nChildren who grew up in the countryside should be familiar with this. Many children, when passing grave mounds, liked to pull out the small flags and wave them around as toys.\n\n\"What's there?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang, and at the same time looked at Little Loli. He found her as bewildered as he was.\n\nThis shouldn't be.\n\nXu Qinglang's skill level was merely that of a \"half-baked expert\"*; his two ghost messengers couldn't see anything clearly here, but he could see the trick*?\n\nLittle Loli seemed to understand something and immediately closed her eyes. Then Zhou Ze only felt that Little Loli's aura beside him suddenly weakened, even becoming somewhat sickly. After she opened her eyes, she looked in that direction and said:\n\n\"Found it, it's right there.\"\n\n\"How did you do that?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Lower your aura. That place is where all the lonely spirits and wild ghosts reside. Both you and I are inhabiting living bodies, so our Yang energy is inherently strong. Therefore, you must lower your own aura to blend into their environment.\n\nClose your eyes, imagine the feeling of being sick. In short, keep giving yourself psychological hints that you're tired, you're weak, you're about to die.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze closed his eyes. Then he continuously recalled that feeling in his mind. Slowly, he seemed to find that boundary. When he opened his eyes again,\n\nLooking at the grave mound again, he felt it was different.\n\nThe originally simple and unremarkable grave mound now looked like an archway. It felt somewhat like an ancient brothel; it was actually hung with lanterns and decorated with festive lights. At the entrance, there was also a short little person dressed in ancient pimp's* clothes, standing there greeting and sending off guests.\n\nThe three of Zhou Ze then walked over proactively.\n\nThe pimp didn't notice Zhou Ze and the others at first. Perhaps it was just as Little Loli said, ghosts have their own circles, and humans have theirs. Although as ghost messengers they could see ghosts, it didn't mean that ghost messengers belonged to this particular circle. So previously, this pimp couldn't see Zhou Ze, just as Zhou Ze hadn't noticed anything unusual about this grave mound before.\n\n\"Oh, sirs, please come in, please come in!\"\n\nThe pimp served with a bow; already short, he appeared even smaller.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and led the way in. The threshold was a bit low; Zhou Ze had to bend down to enter. After walking in, the interior suddenly opened up.\n\nOh wow,\n\nDancers,\n\nOpera singers,\n\nAcrobats performing tricks,\n\nBrightly lit,\n\nA throng of women*,\n\nWhat a bustling sight.\n\nThis truly showed that \"without comparison, there is no harm\"*.\n\nZhou Ze felt that if he were a ghost, he'd rather choose to carouse and indulge freely here, rather than running off to that meaningless bookstore to eat an insincere cold platter prepared by Xu Qinglang, only to be slapped into the gates of hell by Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Oh, sirs, upstairs please! Come play, come play!\"\n\n\"That's right, sirs, come on, upstairs please, we'll serve you well!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked to the second floor on the right and saw many women in large red clothes waving fans in their hands, shouting at him from the balcony.\n\nThe women's faces were so heavily made up, like the attire favored by the Little Japanese*, with pale faces paired with bright red small mouths, they actually looked quite unsettling.\n\n\"Hahahahaha..................\"\n\nA hearty laugh came from upstairs. Immediately after, Zhou Ze watched a corpulent man, blindfolded, playing hide-and-seek with a group of young ladies. He accidentally walked onto the balcony, grabbed a woman who had just been greeting Zhou Ze, and kissed her directly.\n\nZhou Ze felt a pang of unease* watching it.\n\nA thick, greasy layer of rouge was left on the man's lips.\n\nBut soon, Zhou Ze realized something was wrong.\n\nThe man was bald.\n\nBald was one thing,\n\nBut his head was also covered in sores.\n\n\"The Sore-Headed Monk!\"*\n\n\"Who, who called me?\"\n\nThe Sore-Headed Monk immediately removed the cloth blindfolding his eyes. He immediately spotted Zhou Ze standing below.\n\nInstantly, he trembled with fear and immediately shouted:\n\n\"Anti-prostitution raid! Officials are raiding!\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n*   **divine dragon, showing its tail but not its head (神龍見尾不見首 - shén lóng jiàn wěi bù jiàn shǒu):** An idiom referring to something mysterious, elusive, or rarely seen.\n*   **Old Wang Next Door (隔壁老王 - gébì lǎo wáng):** An internet meme in China referring to a neighbor who has an affair with one's spouse, often implying an undesirable rival or an unwelcome presence.\n*   **near vermilion, one turns red; near ink, one turns black (近朱者赤近墨者黑 - jìn zhū zhě chì, jìn mò zhě hēi):** An idiom meaning one is influenced by one's company; good company makes one good, bad company makes one bad.\n*   **cause trouble (砸場子 - zá chǎng zi):** An idiom meaning to disrupt a gathering, cause trouble, or \"crash a party\" with ill intent.\n*   **half-baked expert (二把刀 - èr bǎ dāo):** An idiom describing someone who is a dabbler, an amateur, or has only superficial knowledge or skill.\n*   **the trick (貓膩 - māo nì):** An idiom referring to something fishy, a trick, or a shady practice.\n*   **pimp (龜公 - guī gōng):** Literally \"turtle-man,\" an archaic term for a pimp or a male attendant in a brothel in ancient China.\n*   **a throng of women (鶯鶯燕燕 - yīng yīng yàn yàn):** An idiom literally meaning \"orioles and swallows,\" used to refer to a gathering of beautiful, often flirtatious, women, typically in a brothel setting.\n*   **without comparison, there is no harm (沒有對比就沒有傷害 - méi yǒu duì bǐ jiù méi yǒu shāng hài):** An idiom implying that one only feels bad or inadequate when comparing oneself to something better.\n*   **Little Japanese (小日本 - xiǎo rì běn):** A derogatory term for Japanese people.\n*   **felt a pang of unease (牙酸 - yá suān):** Literally \"teeth-aching,\" an idiom describing a feeling of disgust, queasiness, or discomfort when witnessing something unpleasant.\n*   **The Sore-Headed Monk (癩頭和尚 - lài tóu hé shàng):** Literally \"Lichen-head Monk\" or \"Scabby Monk,\" referring to a monk with skin sores or diseases.

    "content": "Zhou Ze had absolutely no idea he'd run into Monk Laitou in this place.\n\nBack then, this monk had come to his shop and rambled on for half a day about his ideals and aspirations, only to be brushed off by Zhou Ze. He never thought the monk would actually appear here.\n\nApparently, this monk's original philosophy was that all beings are equal, and both humans and ghosts should have the right to remain where they are. Even Underworld officials needed to respect human rights—oh no, ghost rights—and couldn't forcibly send ghosts to hell.\n\nTo Zhou Ze at the time, this monk sounded like a chuunibyo sufferer, like a generation poisoned by *Reader* and *Digest* magazines. All he could think about was how united, strong, and resilient Japanese children were, how orderly they were in times of trouble, how advanced foreign countries were, how backward their own country was, and so on. He was completely out of touch with reality and impractical.\n\nAt that moment, Monk Laitou's loud shout, \"Official anti-vice raid!\", instantly caused the street to erupt.\n\nIndeed, with Zhou Ze's identity, he truly counted as an Underworld runner, and this place was undeniably a shady spot. To put it nicely, it was a town for the deceased, but in the eyes of the Underworld orthodoxy, it was essentially an illegal shantytown where undocumented residents gathered, a target for decisive crackdown.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nEvery household began to close their doors and windows. Street performers and loiterers alike ducked into the alleys. Even the heavily made-up young ladies who had just been calling Zhou Ze up to play from the second floor had vanished without a trace.\n\n\"Whoa.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked over. He had been watching a street performance just a moment ago, but now there was nothing left to see.\n\n\"Where's Lin Ke?\" Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang.\n\nBefore, the three of them had entered one by one, and the street had been bustling. Now, it was completely empty, and he only saw Xu Qinglang but no little loli.\n\n\"I don't know. Probably hiding somewhere to do homework.\"\n\nIt actually seemed quite possible.\n\nThe little loli was clearly a bit abnormal, or perhaps showing abnormal tendencies.\n\nJust thinking of that Hell Girl who, upon their first meeting, had opened her mouth, stuck out her tongue, and shouted, \"The Underworld is orderly, the Yellow Springs are traversable!\"—\n\n—and now she was actually thinking about doing elementary school homework—\n\n—the vibe was truly H.M.P.^1\n\nZhou Ze had never experienced an anti-vice raid himself, but he had bailed out colleagues a few times. Back then, you just had to pay five thousand yuan and have a guarantor write a guarantee letter to get someone out. Later, however, he heard the policy changed: if you were caught for prostitution and married, your spouse had to be notified.\n\nAlright, regardless, this den of iniquity had to be cleared out. Crucially, it was affecting his business, and that was absolutely unacceptable.\n\n\"Kick the door in, let's go.\"\n\nZhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang really wanted to retort, \"Why don't *you* go?\", but thought better of it. He stepped forward, reached out, and gently patted the door, like a neighbor dropping in for a visit.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched.\n\nHe had told Xu Qinglang to kick the door in,\n\nbut if Xu Qinglang's action were paired with a line like, \"Mommy, open the door, I'm home!\"—\n\n—it would be too perfect.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and kicked it.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe door shattered instantly, like it was made of paper.\n\nIn truth, most of the things here were one part real and nine parts fake, just like the food Lady Bai had served when she hosted a banquet for him and Xu Qinglang.\n\nAlthough the door couldn't withstand a kick, the scene's effect was excellent. Xu Qinglang, walking behind, felt that this was a good moment to take a video of Zhou Ze. If the Underworld had an official newspaper, he could even submit an article.\n\nThe headline would be: \"In 2018, under the correct leadership of the Underworld, and the direct guidance of the Ten Great Yama Kings, our county's runners, led by Constable Zhou Ze, resolutely implemented the spirit of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's conference on this anti-vice and illegal publication crackdown. With the primary mission of purifying the ghost-catching market, they focused on key tasks, further strengthened daily supervision, and solidly and effectively advanced the sustained and effective progression of this strike activity, thus protecting the business order of our city's 'Midnight Bookstore'.\"\n\n\"This forged a solid defense line for our city's cultural security and created a favorable social and cultural environment for our city's economic development.\"\n\nThinking about it was quite amusing. Xu Qinglang even covered his mouth and laughed from behind.\n\nHe genuinely wasn't nervous. With Boss Zhou there, he felt he had someone to rely on and wasn't flustered at all. Last time, at the Hot Spring Villa, Boss Zhou had been unconscious; otherwise, things probably wouldn't have been so difficult.\n\nAfter stepping inside, they found a large hall with screens separating several spaces. All the furnishings and layout were antique. He looked up, glancing around, to see a group of young ladies standing side-by-side along the inner railing of the second floor, staring blankly downwards.\n\nThe young ladies suddenly becoming prim and proper made Zhou Ze somewhat unaccustomed to it, and the atmosphere became much more oppressive.\n\nMoreover, these young ladies continuously swayed back and forth, as if silently singing and swaying their heads in unison, which only added to the chilling and grim feeling.\n\nXu Qinglang followed Zhou Ze in, but after entering, he felt the atmosphere was a bit off. He shamelessly took a step back, then, after thinking about it, simply retreated directly outside the door.\n\n\"Damn it, this doesn't look like an anti-vice raid at all; this is clearly a Hongmen Banquet!\"^2\n\n\"Oh, honored guest, won't you step inside?\"\n\nThe short pimp reached out and gently pushed Xu Qinglang's back. Xu Qinglang felt a chill run down his spine, then a wave of dizziness, and in the next moment, he found himself directly in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe pimp stood at the doorway, smiling as he turned to close the door. He was just short of shouting, \"Close the door and beat the dog!\"^3\n\nTo be honest, no matter the industry, when encountering a competitor, few people would directly barge in and smash things. Usually, they'd first check out the opponent's background and see if they had any powerful connections.\n\nBut Boss Zhou couldn't wait, nor did he want to. This matter had touched his tender spot.\n\nAnd also,\n\nBoss Zhou had grown a bit overconfident.\n\nNow, he had armor,\n\nand could unleash an unstoppable force.\n\nNot even the little loli was something he cared about, let alone anyone else?\n\n\"Oh, oh, oh, a visitor is a guest, calm your anger, calm your anger.\"\n\nMonk Laitou walked down from upstairs. A pimp brought him a chair, and he didn't stand on ceremony, sitting right down without offering Zhou Ze a chair.\n\n\"Is this your doing?\"\n\nLooking at Monk Laitou, who had been playing blindfolded hide-and-seek on the second floor earlier—\n\n—he really was causing trouble.\n\n\"Oh, you flatter this poor monk. This poor monk merely came to have some fun, to join in the excitement, to walk through the mundane world. At any time, I am but a passerby, merely changing my way of cultivation.\"\n\nMonk Laitou denied it.\n\n\"Then there must be someone in charge here, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nMeanwhile,\n\nZhou Ze's patience was slowly being worn away.\n\nHe had come to smash the place anyway,\n\nso there was no need to talk about reason.\n\nWhen his most vital interests were infringed upon, there was no need to be reasonable.\n\n\"Esteemed Underworld Official, are you truly going to conduct an anti-vice raid?\"\n\nMonk Laitou rubbed his head, looking quite conflicted.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the one in charge isn't here. This poor monk is just looking after the place for him. How about this, Esteemed Underworld Official, can we take it easy for a bit? When he returns, this poor monk will have him come find you. If not, this poor monk will persuade him to change locations after a while?\"\n\n\"After a while?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Could it be that Esteemed Underworld Official isn't even willing to grant a little bit of leniency?\"\n\n\"Leniency?\"\n\nZhou Ze retorted, then stepped forward, one step at a time.\n\nTalk leniency with me?\n\nIf you don't count the player's ghost attracted by the football match and the aggrieved party—\n\n—according to Bai Yingying—\n\n—during the half-month he was unconscious—\n\n—the bookstore had already lost all business!\n\nWhy the hell did I move the bookstore to South Main Street? Wasn't it so that the human and ghost traffic would be greater, so I could comfortably lie at home waiting for ghosts to come to the door?\n\nNow there are no ghosts, how can I lie around?\n\nJust thinking that he wouldn't be able to laze around like a salted fish in the bookstore anymore, that he'd have to run around catching ghosts—\n\n—Zhou Ze was so pissed off.\n\n\"Master, please calm your anger. I'll arrange a few skilled girls for you, guaranteed to serve you comfortably.\"\n\nThe pimp voluntarily approached to speak at this moment, intending to give Zhou Ze a chance to back down.\n\nBut he had truly underestimated Boss Zhou's level of seriousness regarding this matter.\n\nNot even a single day of leniency—\n\n—was possible!\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand and directly slapped it onto the pimp's head. At the same time, his nails grew long and stabbed down.\n\nThe pimp's expression changed dramatically.\n\nBut immediately, its tiny head actually retracted instantly, and then, like a hedgehog, black quills suddenly grew from its body, bristling like an emergency response, and shot directly towards Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Crack... crack... crack...\"\n\nZhou Ze was instantly covered in armor. These black quills, upon hitting the armor, directly broke off by themselves, some even turning into green smoke and dispersing.\n\n\"You're quite feisty, huh.\"\n\nZhou Ze said, lowering his head to the pimp with the retracted head.\n\nThen he kicked it.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe pimp was kicked away by Zhou Ze like a football. As it flew halfway into the air, Zhou Ze stretched out his palm, and black energy emanated from his fingertips, directly enveloping and pulling it back.\n\nLike passing a ball to his future self seven seconds later.\n\nThe pimp let out a shriek.\n\nClearly, it knew its fate would be dire. This aggressive official seemed to have no intention of letting it go or holding back.\n\nSeeing this, Monk Laitou immediately stood up.\n\nClasped his palms together:\n\n\"Amitābha, where mercy is possible, show mercy. Official Zhou, listen to a word of advice from this poor monk, and give this poor monk a little face. Let it go for now. You and I are both people of standing, why bother getting angry with these small fries?\"\n\n\"Splat!\"\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nlike a watermelon hitting the ground—\n\n—crisp,\n\n—resounding,\n\n—and graphic.\n\nOn Zhou Ze's palm, a pool of gory red liquid continuously flowed.\n\nAnd below,\n\nwas a splat of meat paste,\n\ncurled into a ball, its quills standing upright,\n\nclearly it really was a hedgehog,\n\nand now it was dead as dead could be.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head.\n\nDressed in black armor, he appeared slightly grim, especially with the runes on his armor continuously flowing, adding a touch of mystery.\n\nHe looked at Monk Laitou in front of him,\n\nand feigning confusion, he asked:\n\n\"What was that you just said?\n\nFace?\"\n___\n^1.

    "content": "癩頭和尚有些苦惱地摸了摸自己的頭，然後頹然地放下雙臂，雙手慢慢地交叉，同時開口道：\n\n\n\n  「周差人，陰司很大，我知道；\n\n\n\n  但這裡畢竟是陽間，你陰司的手再長，也休想到這裡攪風攪雨。\n\n\n\n  況且，\n\n\n\n  貧僧還沒圓寂呢！」\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚雙臂忽然撐起來，兩道符紙出現在了他的掌心之中，符紙是紫色的，此時內部竟然夾雜著些許電蛇正在流淌。\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚當初進書屋時就對老道開過嘲諷，指明自己和老道不是一路人，因為在他看來，老道無非是一個混吃混喝的神棍，而他則是真正有道行的存在。\n\n\n\n  「嗚嗚…………嗚嗚…………嗚嗚………………」\n\n\n\n  二樓欄杆邊那一排密密麻麻站著的小姐姐嘴裡一起發出這種呼聲，一時間，一樓的位置竟然掀起了陣陣陰風。\n\n\n\n  一個和尚，\n\n\n\n  配合著一群鬼，\n\n\n\n  這個搭配有點詭異，\n\n\n\n  但卻實打實地給癩頭和尚增添出了些許主場作戰的感覺。\n\n\n\n  「活人的事，我不管，但鬼的事，就是我的事，你這和尚，過界了!」\n\n\n\n  「那就看看，誰死誰活，真以為拿個鬼差證就天下無敵了，天下很大，可不僅僅是一個通城！」 \n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚直接撲了上來，他的個頭並不高，但是大腿很粗，這種矮腳虎奔跑起來其勢也能如風！\n\n\n\n  「嗚嗚…………嗚嗚…………嗚嗚…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤正準備同樣衝過去，\n\n\n\n  卻在此時從上面一個個小姐姐嘴裡都吐出了一根黑絲，瞬間落了下來，纏繞在了他的盔甲上，而後原本軟綿綿的絲線忽然一起發力，剎那間，周澤就像是被蜘蛛網纏繞住的獵物。\n\n\n\n  下意識地想要掙脫，卻覺得自己如同深陷泥沼之中，無法自拔。\n\n\n\n  而癩頭和尚已經接近了，周澤甚至能夠聽到對方掌心符紙內所發出的「滋滋」聲響。\n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  沒辦法了，\n\n\n\n  周澤只能選擇進入那種狀態，\n\n\n\n  雖然現在身體狀況不是很好，也沒完全復原，但周澤覺得解決面前的麻煩不成問題，大不了再昏迷半個月。\n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  就在周澤剛剛閉眼的同時，一條長舌頭忽然從二樓位置延伸出來，像是一條皮鞭一樣狠狠地抽了過去。\n\n\n\n  「啪啪啪啪啪啪……………………」\n\n\n\n  像是每個小姐姐臉上都被狠狠地扇了一巴掌。\n\n\n\n  所有纏繞在周澤盔甲上的絲線也應聲而斷，周澤重新恢復了自由。 \n\n\n\n  小蘿莉的身形出現在了二樓位置，手裡拿著一本《三年級數學習題集》。\n\n\n\n  她居然真的是偷偷找個地方做作業去了！\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉揉了揉眼，打了個呵欠，伸出舌頭舔了舔自己的嘴唇，然後單手撐在欄杆上，看著下面的周澤，活脫脫的一個熬夜做作業忍不住犯困的小女生，樣子嬌憨可愛。\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚來到周澤面前時，周澤雙手指甲直接插了過去。\n\n\n\n  「噗！」\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚雙掌被周澤的十指分別洞穿，\n\n\n\n  但在頃刻間，\n\n\n\n  符紙上的電蛇宛若被賦予了生機，直接竄入周澤體內，周澤只覺得自己全身上下一陣麻痹，下意識地跪了下來。\n\n\n\n  而癩頭和尚哪怕忍著自己雙掌被洞穿，卻依舊保持著站姿，嘴角帶著一抹嘲諷的笑容。\n\n\n\n  「貧僧就說…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  周澤抬起頭，十指指甲再度長長。\n\n\n\n  「噗！」\n\n\n\n  像是布帛被撕碎的聲音，\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚雙掌直接炸裂開，\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！！」\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚慘叫著不停地向後退，失去雙手後的他看起來是那麼的不協調，尤其是那像是冰棍兒一樣的雙臂，顯得很是突兀。 \n\n\n\n  周澤深呼吸了好幾次，\n\n\n\n  他有些累了，\n\n\n\n  因為之前小蘿莉的出手幫助，他還是沒選擇進入那種狀態，能不癱瘓就不癱瘓吧，誰喜歡沒事做玩兒昏迷呢。\n\n\n\n  有些勉強地站起來，盔甲上面有好多道坑坑窪窪的痕跡，像是經歷過火燒後留下的瘢痕。\n\n\n\n  老實說，如果不是有這一身的盔甲，就剛剛癩頭和尚的符紙很可能就能讓周澤斃命，那種玩意兒對於鬼物來說真的就是天大的克星。\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚雙手負於身後，額頭朝上，居然都這個時候還注意保持著自己的驕傲。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得有些奇怪，因為上次在書店見面時，癩頭和尚雖然在他看來有些中二，但依然有著高僧氣度，怎麼這裡的這位不光是玩兒女人打架時還這麼的蹦蹦跳跳？\n\n\n\n  這又不是明星喜歡玩兒人設，\n\n\n\n  這貨前後的人設反差，還真的讓人有些捉摸不透。\n\n\n\n  「嗚嗚嗚………………」\n\n\n\n  二樓的小姐姐們似乎還想搞事情。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉側過頭，嘴巴再度張開；\n\n\n\n  長舌頭這次毫不留情，直接將她們像是冰糖葫蘆一樣一個接著一個洞穿，而後長蛇在二樓空間飛舞翻滾，\n\n\n\n  連帶著舌頭上的小姐姐們也一起旋轉、跳躍還都閉著眼。 \n\n\n\n  這模樣，看起來就像是一個童心未泯的孩子找到了一個新奇的遊戲，但很快她就玩膩了，直接舌頭一甩，上面的小姐姐們一個個地摔落了下來，砸在了地上，堆疊在一起，像是一張張紙人，又像是一具具被放了氣的充氣娃娃。\n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉吐了吐舌頭，像是有些酸了，而後她拿起自動筆，又翻開了習題集，催促道：\n\n\n\n  「你繼續，我做作業。」\n\n\n\n  半個月不見，周澤發現小蘿莉似乎又恢復到了以前的那種冰冷高傲感覺，行事風格也是無拘無束的樣子。\n\n\n\n  就像是當初她先是在自己書店裡看書，看累了就跑去隔壁把許清朗爹媽的亡魂收走了，擺個poss看著許清朗趴在地上痛哭之後揮揮手又回隔壁看書。\n\n\n\n  或許，是因為她的傷勢已經完全恢復了？\n\n\n\n  但你丫的魂血還在老子手上啊，\n\n\n\n  你這麼拽讓老子很不爽啊，\n\n\n\n  到底你是老闆還是我是老闆？\n\n\n\n  周澤很想頤氣指使地讓小蘿莉下來戰鬥，但又覺得孩子說要寫作業自己這個當大人的打擾她好像有點不太合適？\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚此時也沒閒著，一咬舌尖，吐出一口鮮血，而後嘴裡開始不停地念咒。\n\n \n\n  一時間，梵音浩蕩，像是後面有一個聚光燈打在他身上一樣，帶著一種神聖不可侵犯的氣息。\n\n\n\n  這光讓周澤有些難受，\n\n\n\n  很多時候周澤都忘記了自己其實是個鬼，反而依舊認為自己是個人，直到這一刻，他才清楚地感知到了人鬼殊途。\n\n\n\n  這個世界上，是真的有不少東西對鬼物天然就存在克制的。\n\n\n\n  好在許清朗這個時候也沒閒著，他很乾脆，沒拿符紙也沒拿護心鏡之類的玩意兒，因為他知道自己的那些東西都是對付鬼物的，同理，和尚的佛光poss再怎麼炫酷，也只能對周澤有點效果，對許清朗效果並不大，甚至可以說是沒有。\n\n\n\n  也因此，許清朗用最直接的方法，直接一拳砸過去！\n\n\n\n  老許是會打架的，雖然長得像女人，但年輕時也當過流氓，如果不是當初被那位警察局長勒令改邪歸正，可能現在還是一個很非主流的流氓，拳腳功夫其實還是不錯的。\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚這邊經文還沒念幾句就連續吃了許清朗好幾拳，\n\n\n\n  這就有些欺負人了，\n\n\n\n  癩頭和尚修為確實比許清朗高，但他的很多法門都是去對付妖物和鬼物的，許清朗是人，所以他的畢生所學就成了屠龍技，完全施展不開。\n\n\n\n  再加上和尚雙手剛剛被周澤撕碎，這會兒更是被許清朗打得連一點脾氣都沒有。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗還越打越過癮，居然乾脆把和尚掀翻在地上，而後大馬金刀地坐在他身上直接來回地抽。\n\n\n\n  「啪啪啪啪啪！！！！」\n\n\n\n  一邊的周澤慢慢地把身上的盔甲收回去，\n\n\n\n  他記得以前許清朗說過自己打架像是潑婦打架只知道抓撓，\n\n\n\n  現在看看許清朗打架的方式，\n\n\n\n  嘖嘖。\n\n\n\n  跟那些小姐姐一樣，癩頭和尚居然被揍得也開始漏氣，\n\n\n\n  到最後，\n\n\n\n  抽著抽著，癩頭和尚變成了一張紙人，紙人畫著癩頭和尚的模樣，上面寫著生辰八字還有「貪嗔痴恨愛惡欲」七個字。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉從樓上走了下來，看了看地上的紙，道：「這不是那和尚的真身，應該是留下的替身，也真是好方法，把自己身上犯戒的東西留下來，自己只剩下純潔和佛性。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，這樣一來癩頭和尚前後不一的反應就可以說得通了。\n\n\n\n  只是，這裡到底又存在著些什麼東西？\n\n\n\n  或者說……秘密？\n\n\n\n  周澤往前走，嘗試推開面前的屏風，卻發現屏風是假的，是畫在牆壁上的。\n\n\n\n  「這裡的空間看似很大，實際上很小很小，包括二樓的房間，門窗都是畫上去的。」小蘿莉說道。 \n\n\n\n  周澤後退了兩步，\n\n\n\n  然後向前一個衝刺，一腳踹在了屏風上。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  屏風碎裂，\n\n\n\n  甚至是這面牆壁都跟著一起坍塌了下去，\n\n\n\n  前方，\n\n\n\n  是一個很幽暗的空間，\n\n\n\n  有幾十個衣著年紀不同的人正孤獨地站在裡頭，不停地搖晃著，他們是亡魂，也就是周老闆這段時間損失的業績。\n\n\n\n  而在亡魂的腳下，零零散散地開著幾朵花。\n\n\n\n  花瓣婀娜，\n\n\n\n  花蕊誘人，\n\n\n\n  花香撲鼻，\n\n\n\n  花枝婷婷。\n\n\n\n  「這是什麼花，怪好看的，以前沒見過。\n\n\n\n  今兒不是520麼？\n\n\n\n  采點回去送人正好，也沒算白來，對吧？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗指著前面的花問道。\n\n\n\n  然後他沒得到回應，\n\n\n\n  扭過頭看向身後，\n\n\n\n  許清朗發現周澤和小蘿莉都用一種看傻子的目光看著他。\n\n\n\n  「額？怎麼了？」許清朗疑惑地問道。 \n\n\n\n  小蘿莉指了指前面的花，看著許清朗，\n\n\n\n  開口道：\n\n\n\n  「花開彼岸本無岸，魂落忘川猶在川，\n\n\n\n  這是…………彼岸花。」",

    "content": "Red Spider Lilies bloomed by the side of the Yellow Springs Road, emitting a special, ethereal fragrance. They accompanied the deceased on their return journey, one of the few splashes of color in the Underworld.\n\nIt was a unique product of the Underworld, different from the saying, \"oranges grown south of the Huai River are oranges, while oranges grown north of the Huai River are trifoliate oranges.\"* This stuff simply couldn't grow in the Mortal World.\n\nNow, it had been transplanted here. Although this was a special space and a special environment, it was still, after all, in the Mortal World.\n\nOf course, compared to the \"wildflowers\" by the roadside, Boss Zhou was more interested in that group of his \"merit\" up ahead.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked over to examine the state of those departed souls, he found that their bodies were very faint, and their eyes were dull, as if they had hysteria.\n\nDeparted souls had a shelf life, but this shelf life wasn't about time. For example, a departed soul that became a vengeful spirit, even if it eventually fulfilled its obsession, could only dissipate with the wind, losing the chance to re-enter the Underworld and gain reincarnation.\n\nWhile the departed souls here hadn't become vengeful spirits, they had long lost their consciousness and thoughts, leaving only pure soul energy masses. They simply couldn't be considered departed souls anymore.\n\nThe Underworld wouldn't even want \"ghosts\" like these. Even if Zhou Ze forcibly sent them down, he wouldn't get a single bit of merit.\n\nThis gave Boss Zhou a bit of a headache. All that pristine merit was just wasted like that.\n\nLittle Loli stood by, bent down, and observed carefully, saying:\n\n\"This is normal. Red Spider Lilies are originally special species that absorb the energy of the deceased to nourish their growth. Of course, they can grow by the Yellow Springs Road; after all, so many deceased pass by on the Yellow Springs Road every moment. Even if each person dropped a single strand of hair, it would be enough to nourish those Red Spider Lilies.\n\nIt's different here. The few Red Spider Lilies that grew here relied entirely on these dozens of departed souls providing sustenance day and night. Like human juicers, they've long been squeezed dry.\n\nIf not for the existence of this special space, allowing them to return to the sunlight, they would surely have turned to ash and smoke instantly.\"\n\n\"Who's behind this?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I don't know, but a person or organization with such capability is not something we can meddle with. The only thing we can do is report this matter to the higher-ups.\"\n\nLittle Loli reached out to pat Zhou Ze's shoulder, but she was too short to reach. It wasn't like before, when Zhou Ze was just a toy in her hands whom she could make pick her up so she could pat him, so she seemed a bit unaccustomed.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and stroked Little Loli's head.\n\nAfter a \"head pat,\"**\n\nLittle Loli bit her lip.\n\nThis petty man constantly wanted to get revenge for what she had done to him back then, and repeatedly reminded her that their respective statuses had long since changed.\n\n\"Holding back information isn't a good habit,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Reporting this situation to the higher-ups can also earn a certain reward. This reward will be converted into merit. All in all, it shouldn't be less merit than sending these dozens of departed souls to the Underworld.\"\n\n\"Should've said so earlier,\" Zhou Ze's mood instantly brightened.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze soon remembered something else, saying, \"Then the matter in Rongcheng last time, you didn't report that?\"\n\nThat person from Rongcheng was still alive, still alive and kicking. Last time, he even slept in his own bookstore and dropped a pile of ghost messenger badges right in front of him. So, there was no follow-up to that?\n\n\"His matter is a bit special. At the time, the higher-ups also had disagreements on how to handle it and didn't give specific operational instructions. We ourselves linked together the private instructions we received. So, if the mission failed, it failed. As long as he doesn't continue causing trouble, this matter might just be given cold treatment.\"\n\nLittle Loli said.\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out again and stroked Little Loli's head, disregarding her pouting little mouth, and even lightly poked her small mouth with his finger, like teasing his own niece.\n\nHowever, to be honest, Little Loli was indeed Zhou Ze's junior in terms of generational rank.\n\n\"Even the higher-ups in the Underworld Bureau contend for power and profit? They're not a monolithic entity?\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally thought the Underworld Bureau was like a computer.\n\nLittle Loli took a deep breath. She looked at Zhou Ze and suddenly felt like laughing, because she knew whose ghost messenger badge Zhou Ze held. The original owner of that ghost messenger badge—wasn't he tricked by Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva back then, losing even his own Mount Tai Prefectural Office, and ultimately meeting an extremely desolate end?\n\n\"What do you think is the difference between humans and ghosts?\"\n\nLittle Loli didn't specifically mention Lord of Mount Tai's matter. Some things, some arrangements, came from the work of great figures. Even if Lord of Mount Tai had long perished, the arrangements he left behind were not something a small ghost messenger like herself could rashly comment on.\n\n\"Then let's go. What about these Red Spider Lilies? Should we collect them?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Send them to the Underworld. These things, when blooming in the Underworld, are ornamental flowers, but if they spread to the human world, they would become even more terrifying than poppies. Their effect on living people is even more dreadful.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, first walked back to his original position, pointed at the hedgehog at his feet, and said:\n\n\"Does this count as a demonic creature?\"\n\nThis was the first time Zhou Ze had seen a monster. In the past year, Zhou Ze had mostly seen ghosts; he had barely seen any monsters. However, this monster's appearance was quite unimpressive, similar to the minor monster minions he saw in 'Calabash Brothers' when he was a child, with almost no combat power.\n\n\"This isn't a demonic creature. You'll know once we dig up this grave later.\" Little Loli shook her head.\n\nThen, the three of them left the brothel together, returning by the same path. After Zhou Ze walked out, he still bent over, then closed his eyes, adjusting and calming his state. When he opened his eyes again, the archway with lanterns hanging around it that they had entered before had completely disappeared, leaving only a grave mound there.\n\nXu Qinglang also removed the talisman paper from his forehead and simultaneously reached up to pat his own head. Clearly, the effects after sticking on this talisman paper were considerable, a bit like having a cold and fever.\n\n\"Old Xu, could you put in some effort?\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder. \"You seem to have tools in your car. Start digging.\"\n\n\"Why would we dig up someone's grave, this matter...\"\n\nXu Qinglang instinctively wanted to refuse, but seeing that Zhou Ze was a sick person, and Little Loli had taken out her homework book,*** \"Alright then,\" Xu Qinglang didn't waste any more words. He took a multi-functional entrenching tool from the car and started digging.\n\nThe reason it was in the car was actually for self-defense. If knives were carried, they would be confiscated during security checks, which was why he kept this instead. At this moment, it came in handy.\n\nIn fact, he didn't dig for long, because it was hollow inside. Xu Qinglang only dug for a little while before the bottom directly collapsed, revealing a pit over twenty square meters in size.\n\n\"This is the area we entered before, right? Actually, in that small town, only that brothel could be entered. The rest of the shops on the street were all fake, only for looking at, impossible to enter at all. Even that brothel, only the empty space on the first floor could hold people, but the rooms upstairs used for business were all just painted on.\"\n\nLittle Loli explained from the side.\n\nZhou Ze jumped into the pit, followed his remembered location, bent down, took the shovel, and started digging. Before long, several bright red things emerged from inside, like pomegranates, and even red juice flowed out from within.\n\nThe smell was very fragrant.\n\n\"These are Red Spider Lilies?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, Red Spider Lilies.\" Little Loli nodded, \"But in a normal Mortal World environment, this is what they look like.\"\n\nXu Qinglang also wanted to lean over and take a look, but as soon as he smelled a bit of the scent, his expression suddenly changed. He immediately sat cross-legged, chanting something, looking as if he absolutely needed to calm his mind.\n\nSeeing his face instantly turn red, so red that you could squeeze water from it, proved just how terrifying the Red Spider Lily's influence was on ordinary people.\n\nEven poppies, if planted in the ground, still needed to be processed to become drugs, undergoing a series of transformations and operations. But these Red Spider Lilies didn't need that; they just sat there, and ordinary people couldn't stand even a whiff of their scent.\n\nXu Qinglang had already been forewarned, yet he still had to exercise such strict self-control.\n\nZhou Ze rummaged around again, finding a few more, and also found the corpse of a dead hedgehog. This hedgehog must have been the one he killed earlier, but it should have been dead for a long time, air-dried into jerky by now.\n\nA talisman paper was still stuck to the hedgehog's corpse. Zhou Ze reached out and tore it off.\n\n\"You just asked me if this was a monster, and I said no. This is just a spirit-charm, an effect produced by empowering an animal's corpse with a yin soul talisman. It's much lower level than a corpse charm.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He didn't choose to burn all these Red Spider Lilies. Instead, he took off his upper garment and wrapped all these things inside.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Little Loli frowned.\n\n\"How about this: I'll take these things and find an isolated place to wait. You two go back first and get me some bottles with good seals. This stuff is useful to me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Don't play with fire and burn yourself,\" Little Loli warned with a grave expression.\n\n\"You know what? I just took a whiff of this stuff and suddenly felt hungry. I want to eat something. It's much more effective than sour plum juice or blueberry juice. It'd really be a shame to burn this stuff. I'll handle it myself and use it as an appetizer before my meals.\"\n\nFor someone who had long entered the \"salted fish life,\"**** the problem of sleep could be solved by hugging Bai Yingying, but the problem of eating, even with sour plum juice, was truly hard to stomach.\n\nWith this stuff, he should finally be able to taste delicious food. Zhou Ze felt that no matter how dangerous it truly was, it had to be kept.\n\n\"You... you...\"\n\nXu Qinglang, on the side, seemed unable to resist the hallucinatory effect of the scent with his Heart-Purifying Incantation.\n\nHe slowly stood up, pointing at Zhou Ze, his face flushed, looking lustful, sounding like a scolding yet also like a delicate moan:\n\n\"Don't... don't you want my... juice... anymore...\"\n\nIt seemed Old Xu was truly deeply poisoned.\n\n\"Sober him up. That sounds truly disgusting, I'm about to throw up.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at Little Loli.\n\nLittle Loli stepped forward, stuck out her tongue, and directly lashed Xu Qinglang's neck. Xu Qinglang was struck as if by electricity, immediately falling unconscious. But even though he was unconscious, his body continued to twitch as if he was still doing something in his dreams.\n\nHaving dealt with Xu Qinglang, Little Loli continued to look at Zhou Ze with a stern face.\n\n\"Don't remind or warn me anymore; it's useless. The people consider food as their heaven*****,\" Zhou Ze said domineeringly.\n\nLittle Loli shook her head,\n\nand said:\n\n\"After you've prepared it, can you share a bit with me?\"\n***\n\\* \"Oranges grown south of the Huai River are oranges, while oranges grown north of the Huai River are trifoliate oranges.\" (A Chinese idiom emphasizing how environment affects development.)\n\\** \"Head pat\" (A playful, informal term describing an affectionate or dominant gesture of patting someone's head, often making the recipient feel 'defeated' or yielding.)\n\\*** \"Homework book\" (While literally correct, in this context it refers to a ledger or notebook used for work, adding to Little Loli's distinctive character.)\n\\**** \"Salted fish life\" (A modern Chinese slang term referring to a lazy, unmotivated, or unambitious way of living.)\n\\***** \"The people consider food as their heaven\" (A Chinese proverb emphasizing that food is the most fundamental and important thing for people's survival and well-being.)",

    "content": "Little Lolita didn't go any farther. Instead, she went directly to a nearby house and found a large wine jar. Zhou Ze was initially worried whether the jar could truly be sealed, and then it was time to witness a miracle.\n\nLittle Lolita took out a new blank exercise book from her schoolbag, tore pages off one by one, and motioned for Zhou Ze to first put the Other Shore Flower inside. Then, she took the paper, licked it with her tongue to moisten it with saliva, then stuck it on, pasting a whole circle around the jar. She then clapped her hands, took a bottle of mineral water from the car, and drank it \"gulp gulp,\" seemingly replenishing the water she had just consumed.\n\nAlright, Zhou Ze knew that Little Lolita's tongue could stretch very, very long, but he really hadn't expected the saliva on that long tongue would actually have such an effect. Since Little Lolita said the seal was absolutely fine, Zhou Ze stopped thinking about it.\n\nOn the way back, Zhou Ze was driving, because Xu Qinglang was still unconscious, his whole body lying horizontally on the back seat, still immersed in some beautiful dreamland, like someone who had drunk too much. Of course, this was still the result of Little Lolita knocking him out. If he were conscious now, then God knows what eye-scorching* things he would do.\n\nThe effect of this stuff on living people truly surpassed all known psychoactive drugs in the world; it was simply no longer on the same level.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was very careful on the way back, and luckily didn't run into traffic police, otherwise, it would be funny if he ended up with an unlicensed driving charge again.\n\nFirst, he drove Little Lolita home, driving to the outside of the residential area where Wang Ke lived.\n\nLittle Lolita sat in the passenger seat. She wasn't in a hurry to get out after the car stopped. Instead, she glanced again at the wine jar at Zhou Ze's feet, stretched out her tongue, and licked her lips.\n\n\"I'm very curious, how did you manage to eat before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"This is why most of us ghost emissaries find host bodies. Most of the time we are dormant, while the host performs their own actions. Two souls coexist within one body. Therefore, the host is not affected when eating or sleeping.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He understood. Because he was a stowaway, even if by chance he became a ghost emissary, the original owner of this body had long since kicked the bucket^. So he was both a temporary resident and now the master. Naturally, he couldn't fall asleep himself and let the other soul in this body go eat, sleep, and play.\n\n\"Then you shouldn't need this at all,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nLittle Lolita glanced at Zhou Ze, and said very seriously:\n\n\"I've also lived.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nAll ghosts were human before they died.\n\n\"So, I also lived a normal life, and ate meals.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\n\"So, I also get cravings, and I want to try the taste of food when I'm awake!\"\n\nLittle Lolita blurted it out in one breath, then propped her chest with both hands, sitting there pouting.\n\n\"Alright, I'll save a portion for you after I make it. You can pick it up at the bookstore when you have time.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gave her a \"head pat kill\"^^ again.\n\nThis time, Little Lolita didn't resist.\n\n\"Say hi to your dad for me.\" Zhou Ze waved at Little Lolita, watching Little Lolita walk into the residential area. Actually, it had been a long time since he had contacted Wang Ke.\n\nLast time Wang Ke introduced that client to him, it turned out to be the Sea God's woman. Of course, this matter certainly had no direct relation to Wang Ke.\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze found that he was truly a cold and unfeeling person. His two childhood friends had never contacted him since they started working, and even after recognizing each other, the relationship remained distant. Of course, there was also Dr. Lin's family. Zhou Ze was also too lazy to think too much.\n\nThe Buddha said, people need to reflect on themselves.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. Self-reflection was too boring. It was more enjoyable to go back and tinker with this thing sooner. Just thinking that he wouldn't need to wolf down food anymore but could eat unhurriedly, he felt full of hope for life.\n\nZhou Ze had also asked Little Lolita, since she could go to Hell anytime, why not go to Hell and pick some when she had nothing to do. Little Lolita gave him a look as if he were an idiot.\n\nOn the Yellow Springs Road, how many pairs of eyes are watching?\n\nYou, a tiny ghost emissary, run down just to pick an Other Shore Flower and run back up?\n\nDo you think your life is too long?\n\nBack at the bookstore, Old Daoist Priest was sitting at the shop's entrance smoking. Zhou Ze motioned to Old Daoist Priest to come over and help carry Xu Qinglang inside.\n\n\"Oh, what happened?\" Old Daoist Priest asked after hoisting Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"He's drunk,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Drunk, but there's no smell of alcohol?\" Old Daoist Priest was a bit confused, but didn't ask further, carrying Xu Qinglang directly upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze also entered the bookstore, carrying the wine jar. He found that Bai Yingying wasn't on the first floor. He didn't ask Death Servant to help him, but simply continued carrying the wine jar himself up to the second floor.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door with his foot, he happened to encounter Bai Yingying walking out of the door.\n\nBai Yingying's face was flushed, extremely excited, hysterically shouting:\n\n\"Aaaaaaah!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThis damn thing scared Boss Zhou so much he almost dropped the wine jar in his hand.\n\nBoss Zhou swore,\n\nif the wine jar broke,\n\nand the Other Shore Flower inside was also destroyed,\n\nhe would definitely, without hesitation, stab the female zombie in front of him a hundred times, oh a hundred times!\n\n\"Aaaaaah!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying saw Zhou Ze had returned, excitedly rushed up, hugged Zhou Ze, and then kissed Zhou Ze on the cheek,\n\n\"Aaaaaah, we're champions, Boss!\n\nRNG won the championship!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying was as happy as a hundred-pound simpleton***.\n\n\"PUBG?\" Zhou Ze asked tentatively.\n\nThe truth was that Boss Zhou, as a surgeon in his previous life, was terribly busy. Any free time he had was spent researching the latest medical equipment and classic cases. To climb up and achieve his life's ideals, he constantly whipped himself like a spinning top. How could he possibly have time to play games?\n\nIn this life, having died once, he understood the true meaning of a lazy, slow-paced life even more. He also had no mind to play games.\n\nSo regarding championships,\n\nand things like RNG,\n\nBoss Zhou was truly completely bewildered.\n\n\"It's League of Legends, which is LoL,\" Bai Yingying explained.\n\n\"Oh, as long as you're happy.\"\n\nZhou Ze motioned for Bai Yingying to move aside. He should have called Death Servant to help instead. Why did this internet-addicted girl feel so unreliable now?\n\nBut looking again at Bai Yingying, with her white hair, happily there, Zhou Ze suddenly felt that dotingly watching her happy like this also seemed to be a kind of happiness.\n\nPerhaps because his body was already weak, not fully recovered, and he had also fought, Zhou Ze slept for a long time. He didn't wake up until almost noon. Bai Yingying, as usual, waited for the boss to wake up before getting out of bed with him.\n\nZhou Ze washed up and went downstairs. He was preparing to tell Old Daoist Priest to take money to buy some laboratory equipment or sealing tools. He wanted to juice and preserve the Other Shore Flower; putting it in a wine jar again wouldn't be suitable.\n\nOld Daoist Priest was attending to customers. Xu Qinglang, that fellow, hadn't woken up yet. Bai Yingying had to go downstairs with Zhou Ze. Death Servant only knew to sit motionlessly in a corner. So Old Daoist Priest was the only one responsible for serving customers.\n\nOld Daoist Priest was actually able to make coffee and cocktails in a proper manner; at least he managed to handle the customers.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, because his favorite window seat was actually occupied by two young girls.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze recall Xu Qinglang's suggestion: to change the minimum consumption to a thousand yuan and up. This would prevent many living people from coming in to consume.\n\nOf course, since they were here, they were customers. Zhou Ze could only choose another sofa and settled down. At the same time, he instructed Old Daoist Priest a few words. Old Daoist Priest acknowledged with a \"good\" and went out to purchase things.\n\nBoss Zhou continued to pick up the newspaper and drink tea, entering a \"salted fish\"**** state.\n\nThe bookstore was a little noisy, because there were two tables of customers. One table was that pair of girls, the other table was two young women. The young women had two children, a boy and a girl, running around in the bookstore, making some noise.\n\nThe two children actually ran to where Death Servant was sitting. The boy even pointed at Death Servant and introduced to the girl beside him which superhero this was and what special abilities he had. They probably really took the motionless Death Servant for a statue, after all, Death Servant had no breath or heartbeat.\n\nTheir speaking voices were a bit loud, so loud that Zhou Ze even somewhat wanted to order Death Servant to take off his mask to satisfy the two children's wish.\n\nOn second thought, he decided against it, there was no need to get angry with children.\n\nZhou Ze simply took out his phone and casually refreshed the news.\n\nAt this time, the mothers of the two children also seemed to notice their children's noise. They stood up and told their children to be quieter and not disturb others. The two children were quite obedient, and actually stopped talking, starting to look for comic books to read.\n\n\"Brother, come here, I have Doraemon here.\" The little girl held a comic book and whispered to the boy.\n\nThe boy heard this, and immediately trotted over from the other end.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\none of the two girls who had originally occupied Zhou Ze's preferred window seat for sunbathing suddenly stretched out her leg as the boy passed by her, and the boy was directly tripped.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nwith a sound,\n\nthe boy fell directly onto the ground, falling quite badly. Especially, his nose hit the ground, and started bleeding immediately.\n\n\"Wuwuwu...\"\n\nThe boy sat on the ground and immediately burst into tears, looking with wronged and fearful eyes at the brightly dressed young lady beside him.\n\n\"Oh dear, little one, how could you be so careless? Does it hurt? Let big sister take a look.\"\n\nThe girl who had just stretched out her leg to intentionally trip the boy immediately stood up with feigned concern, and helped the little boy up.\n\nThe little boy's mother heard the crying and immediately turned her head to look, ran over and picked up her child,\n\n\"Oh dear, it's bleeding. I told you not to mess around, but you didn't listen. Look at this fall, it's all bleeding.\"\n\nThe mother started scolding her son.\n\nThe little boy reached out, while crying, wanting to point at the older sister in front of him. He knew it was her who tripped him.\n\n\"Kids will be kids. Falling and tripping is common. Hurry and take the child to the hospital.\" The girl and her friend immediately came over to comfort them.\n\nThe boy's mother had previously been busy chatting with her best friend and hadn't seen the scene of the fall. At that moment, she nodded to the girl: \"Thank you, I'm going to the hospital.\"\n\nSaying this, the mother immediately had her best friend take her daughter and leave the bookstore together.\n\nThe little boy was held by his mother. As he walked out of the bookstore, he couldn't help but peek at the older sister who had intentionally tripped him.\n\nAfter the children and mothers had all left, the two girls both sat back on the sofa.\n\nThe girl who had stretched out her leg sighed, and laughed:\n\n\"They're so noisy. Things born with a mother but without a mother's teaching*. These 'bear children'***** are the most annoying.\"\n\n\"Heh heh, your leg was really fast just now.\"\n\n\"Really? I'm happy to see 'bear children' have bad luck. Especially since he fell and broke something, got a nosebleed, I just feel so satisfied, heh heh.\"\n\n\"Me too, me too. Those two kids were really noisy, it's a pity they didn't fall to their death.\"\n\n\"Haha, you're so vicious.\"\n___\n* \"Eye-scorching\" (辣眼睛 là yǎnjīng) is internet slang for something disgusting, cringeworthy, or an eyesore.\n^ \"Kicked the bucket\" (GG了 GG le) is a gaming term for \"game over\" or \"died,\" used colloquially to mean someone has died.\n^^ \"Head pat kill\" (摸頭殺 mō tóu shā) is internet slang describing an affectionate head pat that makes the recipient feel delighted or disarmed.\n*** \"Simpleton\" (傻孢子 shǎ bāozǐ) literally means \"silly spore/idiot fungus,\" and is a colloquial, often endearing, term for someone simple or foolish.\n**** \"Salted fish\" (鹹魚 xiányú) is internet slang referring to someone who has given up on their dreams and ambitions, living a lazy, unmotivated life.\n***** This is a harsh insult implying poor upbringing or ill-mannered behavior, literally \"things born with a mother but without a mother's teaching.\"\n****** \"Bear children\" (熊孩子 xióng háizi) is a popular Chinese term for mischievous, ill-behaved, or spoiled children.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze silently put down his phone, simultaneously reaching up to rub his eyes.\n\nDeadpool stood up, picked up a rag beside him, and walked over to where the two girls were sitting. He bent down and began wiping away the blood that had dripped from the little boy.\n\nDeadpool's job at the bookstore was simple: cleaning.\n\nNo salary needed, no room and board required, never complained, never protested, never spoke out of turn; he just knew how to bury himself in hard work.\n\n\"My gosh, he's actually alive,\" one girl exclaimed.\n\nThey had noticed this Deadpool before, but because he had remained motionless, they and the two children had assumed he was merely a humanoid model sculpture displayed by the bookstore.\n\nDeadpool, ever professional, finished cleaning, stood up, and prepared to leave.\n\nBut Zhou Ze reached out, signaling him not to move yet.\n\nAt this point, the two girls, whether out of mischief or personal interest, proactively came forward, wanting to take a photo with Deadpool. One was responsible for taking the picture, while the other went up to pose with Deadpool.\n\nPerhaps, in their eyes, he was an actor hired by the bookstore for promotion.\n\nBoss Zhou lit a cigarette and watched the two girls take photos with Deadpool incessantly. One of the girls, overly excited, asked Deadpool if he could remove his mask for another photo.\n\nDeadpool didn't move. He looked at Zhou Ze, waiting for Zhou Ze's command.\n\n\"Looks like your boss is really strict. It's so hot, and he still makes you wear full-body clothing,\" one girl said, speaking up for Deadpool.\n\n\"Boss, let him take off his mask and take a photo with us. What if he's a handsome guy?\" the other girl pleaded with Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, signaling that Deadpool could remove his mask.\n\nThen Deadpool removed his mask.\n\nImmediately following was several seconds of dead silence,\n\nfollowed by:\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe two girls screamed hysterically, scrambling and crawling out of the bookstore. The girl who had tripped the little boy earlier even ran into the glass door as she passed through, cutting her face.\n\nThat collision made Zhou Ze, who was standing nearby, feel a bit teeth-grindingly pained; she probably messed up her face.\n\nDeadpool looked somewhat bewildered, but showed no emotional fluctuation.\n\nLast time, he was cleaved by the Ghost Samurai, leaving a massive scar from his face downwards, making his already terrifying appearance even more grotesque.\n\nRather than saying he was a \"person\" now, it was more accurate to describe him as a humanoid worm.\n\nZhou Ze also wasn't sure why he kept him. To keep him cleaning? To save on a janitor's expenses?\n\nAnd of course, it definitely wasn't some bullshit about \"deep father-son affection.\"\n\nPerhaps, it was a pity.\n\nEven if the Priest was a scoundrel in life, just look at the things he *did*—he really knew how to stir up trouble!\n\nAnd after dying, he could even get back on his feet. Something like this, though seemingly useless now, would be quite a waste to simply discard like trash.\n\n\"Put it on,\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nNot just the two girls; even Boss Zhou, who had seen his share of things, found it an eyesore.\n\nDeadpool nodded and put his mask back on.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously flicked off some cigarette ash,\n\nSeeing Deadpool about to walk over with the rag again, he awkwardly stomped his shoe on the ground and simultaneously instructed:\n\n\"Go burn those two pieces of joss paper money from the counter outside the door.\"\n\n…………\n\nOld Tao knew many people from all walks of life. His entire life, he had essentially just drifted along, failing to establish a family or have children. According to traditional Chinese values for judging a person's success or failure, Old Tao was undoubtedly a typical example of failure.\n\nBut he only sought to live freely and happily; as long as he was content, that was enough. Anyway, after death, everyone had to walk the Road to the Yellow Springs and jump across the Bridge of Helplessness, so why not be as carefree as possible while alive?\n\nHe had been in Tongcheng for over half a year and had made quite a few disreputable friends.\n\nActually, according to Zhou Ze's intention, he wanted to acquire a basic set of research equipment, like that found in hospitals or some high school chemistry labs. He needed to roughly purify and package the Red Spider Lilies, making them easy to carry and consume.\n\nOld Tao didn't know exactly what Zhou Ze intended to do; he only knew to complete the tasks assigned by his boss as perfectly as possible.\n\nAfter leaving the bookstore, he picked up his phone and called a friend he had made in Tongcheng. He said he wanted a set of purification lab instruments and asked if his friend could get them.\n\nThe man was silent for a moment, then said, \"Okay.\"\n\nThe two agreed to meet first at a coffee shop on South Street. After Old Tao sat down, he felt a bit foolish. He should have just arranged to meet at the bookstore. This place was only one street away, and he ended up wasting money on coffee.\n\nThe man arrived, sporting a full beard. He was a distant cousin of Old Tao's. When Old Tao first went to \"comfort\" a fallen woman and was just coming out of the roll-up door, the man was standing at the entrance waiting.\n\nOld Tao shared a cigarette with him. The two nodded, and then the man thanked Old Tao, saying that he had \"smoothed the way\" for him, which made things easier for him too.\n\nLater, Old Tao went again, but when the roll-up door opened, it was the man who walked out.\n\nWith these two experiences, they were considered distant cousins. The two even added each other on WeChat and went out for a BBQ together. Old Tao knew he was a smuggler, essentially just a small-time hoodlum, but he was getting on in years.\n\n\"Whoa, your complexion looks pretty bad,\" Old Tao asked with some concern. \"Go less next time, take better care of your health. If your body gives out, who are they going to rely on?\"\n\nThe Bearded Man<sup>[1]</sup> paused, nodded, and then said:\n\n\"That thing, what do you want it for?\"\n\n\"My boss plans to use it to purify something. Anyway, ordinary people can't touch the stuff he makes; if they do, big problems will happen.\"\n\nOld Tao said very seriously.\n\n\"Is that stuff potent?\" the Bearded Man asked.\n\n\"Potent?\"\n\nOld Tao thought for a moment. Yesterday, Xu Qinglang was carried back to his room by him. Although the boss said he was drunk, Old Tao could clearly tell that wasn't the case. He immediately said:\n\n\"Very potent! Anyway, it's super enjoyable and exhilarating when you're lying on the bed. Damn, it's even scary to watch.\"\n\nThe Bearded Man swallowed hard and continued to ask, \"So, after you make it, where does it mainly flow out to?\"\n\n\"Flow out?\"\n\nOld Tao thought for a moment. The stuff the boss made probably couldn't be used by ordinary people. It might only circulate with Little Loli or Boss Liang. He replied:\n\n\"It'll just circulate within their own circles.\"\n\n\"Existing market, then?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I'm asking, does it only circulate in Tongcheng?\"\n\nOld Tao remembered that Boss Liang seemed to be in Shanghai and added:\n\n\"Might also send it to Shanghai.\"\n\n\"It also circulates to Shanghai?\" The Bearded Man's expression became increasingly grave, his tension clearly visible.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong with you?\"\n\n\"N-nothing...\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nThe Bearded Man reached out, took a small earpiece out of his ear, placed it on the table, then pressed his palms together and apologized:\n\n\"Sorry, brother. I just got caught by the police for smuggling.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\nOld Tao looked utterly bewildered.\n\nThis,\n\nNo,\n\nWait, this...\n\nJust then,\n\nCustomers at a nearby coffee shop table stood up. One person restrained the Bearded Man, while two others simultaneously held Old Tao's shoulders, pushing him down onto the sofa.\n\n\"Behave yourself!\"\n\nOld Tao looked terribly wronged,\n\nThere's a misunderstanding!\n\nOfficer!\n\n\"This is my ID. We now suspect you are involved in the manufacturing and trafficking of narcotics. Please cooperate with our investigation.\"\n\nSeveral more police officers walked in from outside. One of them pulled out his ID and flashed it in front of Old Tao.\n\n…………\n\n\"Boss, where's Old Tao?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze as she walked out, having finished washing up.\n\n\"He went out to buy something for me. I need to process the Red Spider Lilies I got yesterday,\" Zhou Ze replied. \"What's wrong with that guy? He's been gone so long and still hasn't bought the stuff back.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded, but immediately, her gaze shifted. She quickly walked in front of the boss and said:\n\n\"Boss, there are many eyes watching us from outside.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Boss Zhou hadn't yet snapped out of his lazy newspaper-reading state.\n\n\"Those few pedestrians over there, and the ones sitting on the steps reading newspapers or playing on their phones, and the two women waiting for the bus at the platform—they're all staring at us.\"\n\nBai Yingying said with great certainty.\n\nBoss Zhou stood up and walked to the bookstore entrance to look.\n\nHe wouldn't doubt Bai Yingying's judgment. In that regard, she was actually stronger than him, since when he wasn't in his peak state, there wasn't much difference between him and an ordinary person.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang stumbled downstairs, wearing loose pajamas, complaining while pounding his head:\n\n\"My head hurts like hell.\"\n\n\"Did you have a great dream last night?\" Zhou Ze quipped, turning his head.\n\n\"Those Red Spider Lilies really shouldn't be touched,\" Xu Qinglang said, shaking his head. \"It's worse than being drunk.\"\n\nOn the third floor, by the window of a building across from the bookstore, a detective using high-powered binoculars immediately relayed a message via his earpiece:\n\n\"Report: There's also a woman in the bookstore who has come downstairs. Suspected of having an improper relationship with the suspect, the store owner.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nLittle Loli, just out of school, got off the bus, carrying a large schoolbag, and walked towards the bookstore.\n\nShe was in a good mood, humming a song, looking utterly innocent and carefree.\n\nThe thought of being able to take some of that stuff home for a late-night snack once Zhou Ze finished making it filled her with delight. She had been craving it for a long time and wanted to re-experience the pleasure of eating.\n\nShe pushed open the bookstore door and walked in, and for the first time ever, she greeted Zhou Ze with a smile and initiated conversation:\n\n\"Constable, is that stuff ready?\"\n\nThe distant detective reported again:\n\n\"Report: Requesting delay of forced entry plan;\n\nA female child has entered the bookstore, suspected of possibly being taken hostage by the suspect.\"\n***\n<sup>[1]</sup> The same man with the full beard mentioned earlier.",

    "content": "「So, how do you plan to handle this? The equipment still hasn't been bought?」\n\n「Old Tao hasn't come back yet.」\n\n「Why is that old thing so slow? Why didn't you say something earlier? I would've gotten you a set,」 the little loli said helplessly.\n\nIf you can't buy it, can't you steal it?\n\nAnyway, it's not some high-tech equipment. Boss Zhou wasn't going to do biochemical research here; taking some stuff from a high school chemistry lab would be enough.\n\n「So, you're planning to make them into something like capsules?」 The little loli pointed at Zhou Ze's design sketch and asked, 「Can you do it?」\n\n「The difficulty isn't great. The important thing is to first purify, then compress. It's best if we can get crystals, otherwise it won't be convenient for us to carry and use, and we need to eliminate any impact on ordinary people around us.」\n\nThe little loli nodded. She felt a vague sense of awe, but since Zhou Ze guaranteed with a pat on his chest that this wasn't some high-difficulty technical job and he could do it himself once the equipment arrived, she was willing to wait a bit longer.\n\n「Alright, I'm leaving then. What a disappointment. I thought we could go out for a late-night snack today.」\n\n「I have plum juice there. You can make do with that.」\n\n「You're just eating to eat. You don't enjoy the deliciousness of food at all. I'm not interested. It's easier for me to just sleep and let Wang Rui go eat and sleep herself.」\n\nThe big one and the small one walked down from the second floor.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze froze,\n\nBecause about a third of the seats on the first floor were surprisingly occupied by customers.\n\nZhou Ze swore to heaven,\n\nSince opening,\n\nHis bookstore's occupancy rate had never been this high!\n\nCould it be that the living standards of Tongcheng's people had suddenly leaped, and the 100-yuan minimum spend was truly outdated?\n\nHowever, soon, Zhou Ze and the little loli stopped in their tracks together.\n\nAmong the seated customers, two or three gave Zhou Ze and the little loli a slight sense of pressure, as if those two people carried an invisible light, somewhat dazzling.\n\nEither these people were desperate criminals, or the kind who mixed with gangs and had seen and personally participated in fights and bloodshed; or they should be police.\n\nThe first possibility was unlikely. Boss Zhou didn't feel he had done anything worth these \"social types\" specially coming here to sit. And seeing their expressions, pretending to drink and read but actually constantly observing their surroundings, it was obvious what their profession was.\n\n「Did you commit a crime?」 the little loli whispered to Zhou Ze.\n\n「No,」 Zhou Ze responded softly.\n\nBoss Zhou believed his recent actions shouldn't have attracted police to his doorstep. Even if there were occasional borderline offenses, he would just have someone burn ghost money outside the bookstore, and the trouble would pass.\n\nCould it be that the two girls he scared away that morning had some powerful background?\n\nThinking about it, it didn't make sense. Firstly, those two girls might not have the courage to retaliate against him. Secondly, even if it was retaliation, there was no need for such a large-scale operation, was there? Furthermore, he had also had Deadpool burn joss paper afterward.\n\nBoss Zhou always disliked trouble the most.\n\n「Go upstairs and leave with the wine jar first,」 Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe little loli nodded, turned around, and went straight upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze gave Deadpool, who was sitting blankly to the side, a look, signaling him to go upstairs and leave with the little loli.\n\nBai Yingying was still serving tea and drinks to everyone there. Zhou Ze walked over, semi-reclined in his original spot, picked up the newspaper on the table, and casually flipped through it.\n\nBai Yingying brought a coffee and walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n「Go upstairs, then leave,」 Zhou Ze said.\n\n「They are...」 Bai Yingying had already noticed something was wrong. She had mentioned before that someone was watching the place from outside, and now they had brazenly entered the shop disguised as customers.\n\nBai Yingying's identity was arranged by Xu Qinglang. This identity couldn't withstand scrutiny.\n\nOnce Bai Yingying also went upstairs, Zhou Ze had no more worries.\n\nActually, for Zhou Ze, what couldn't see the light of day in the bookstore were the people themselves.\n\nFor example, Bai Yingying's identity—you couldn't possibly explain to the police that she was a person from the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty, could you?\n\nOr Deadpool, if you just pulled open his jacket, how would you explain it?\n\nZhou Ze had originally worried that letting Bai Yingying and the others leave first would arouse the suspicion of the Ah Sirs* present, but clearly, Zhou Ze had overthought it. On the contrary, the little loli and Bai Yingying going upstairs made the Ah Sirs sigh in relief, thinking that Zhou Ze no longer had hostages nearby.\n\nXu Qinglang delivered cocktails to the last table. As he passed Zhou Ze, he curiously winked at him, meaning, 「What's going on?」\n\nZhou Ze shrugged,\n\n「What the heck are you asking me for?」\n\n「I don't know either.」\n\nBut Boss Zhou immediately thought of something and reminded Xu Qinglang:\n\n「Make them pay first.」\n\nXu Qinglang listened and thought it made a lot of sense. It was rare to have so many suckers come in; it was better to settle the bill first. Most importantly, what if these Ah Sirs suddenly transformed later, like Emperor Kangxi in disguise**, it would be inconvenient to collect money then.\n\nOld Xu went to collect the money, table by table.\n\nThe police actually paid the money. It must be that they were also too embarrassed to reveal their identities when it was time to collect payment.\n\nOnce Xu Qinglang finished collecting the money and put it into the bar counter drawer,\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath,\n\n「As long as the money's collected, it's fine.」\n\n「Next,」\n\n「Let your performance begin.」\n\nBut they waited and waited, and these police officers continued to quietly drink their coffee or drinks. No one stood up and revealed their identity to Zhou Ze.\n\nThis made Boss Zhou a bit helpless.\n\n「Can't you just get to the point?」\n\nBoss Zhou stood up, walked to the bookstore's entrance, and pushed open the door.\n\nEven at this moment, the police inside the room still didn't stand up.\n\n「What the hell are they doing?」\n\nZhou Ze was utterly confused.\n\nHe subconsciously took two steps forward.\n\nAnd just then, two passersby on either side of the bookstore door suddenly rushed up, each grabbing one of Zhou Ze's shoulders, trying to control him.\n\nUnder the stimulus, Zhou Ze almost lost control and brought out his armor or claws. He could only keep taking deep breaths to calm himself, cooperating with the two plainclothes officers' actions, even actively putting his hands behind his back for them to handcuff him.\n\nThe two plainclothes officers were stunned for a moment. In all their years in the profession, it was the first time they had seen such a cooperative criminal suspect.\n\nThis time, Boss Zhou really wasn't chickening out. The crucial thing was that he needed to figure out what crime he had committed, right?\n\nSuch a large-scale operation, so many police visiting his own shop – Boss Zhou was utterly bewildered.\n\n「We are the police. We now suspect you of involvement in drug manufacturing and trafficking. Please cooperate with our work. We will take you back to the police station for investigation.」\n\nA middle-aged police officer walked up to Zhou Ze and showed him his ID.\n\nDrug manufacturing?\n\nDrug trafficking?\n\nBoss Zhou was utterly dumbfounded.\n\nBoss Zhou was put into a police car. Xu Qinglang inside was also restrained and taken to a police car. Bai Yingying, the little loli, and Deadpool were not discovered; perhaps the police didn't consider them suspects.\n\nAfter arriving at the police station, the interrogation room was the first stop. The questions the police asked made Zhou Ze somewhat dumbfounded and amused.\n\nHe himself opened a workshop to make drugs?\n\nNot only circulating in Tongcheng, but also preparing to enter the Shanghai market? And even using Shanghai as a springboard to radiate further?\n\nBoss Zhou wanted to ask himself:\n\n「Am I that diligent?」\n\nThe police seemed to be searching his bookstore. During the interrogation, someone called the interrogating officer, who then specifically asked Zhou Ze why there was a freezer in Zhou Ze's bedroom.\n\nMoreover, that kind of freezer was clearly for dead bodies, the same model rented out in morgues.\n\nZhou Ze said that summer had arrived, the air conditioning wasn't powerful enough, so he used that thing to cool down.\n\nThe interrogating officer pounded the table hard, scolding Zhou Ze to correct his attitude, cooperate well with the interrogation, and that 「confession earns leniency, resistance brings severity!」\n\nBoss Zhou couldn't help but roll his eyes. He guessed that if he said he could only fall asleep in the freezer without that high school girl (Bai Yingying) sleeping next to him, the officer would probably think his attitude was even more problematic, or that he was actively mocking the police, right?\n\nAfter the interrogation, Zhou Ze was sent to the detention room, which was a temporary holding area maintained by the police station. The police seemed to have a set number of hours for detention, and if there was no concrete evidence, Boss Zhou would be released once the time was up.\n\nIn summary,\n\nThis day had been quite strange. He was accused of being a drug dealer for no reason. Of course, Zhou Ze also felt some relief. That day, the delivery guy fell at his doorstep. He took the money, but still flushed that bag of blue pills down the toilet; he didn't keep them. Otherwise, if they were found during a search, it would truly be a case of 「yellow mud in the crotch, not shit but looks like shit.」***\n\nOf course, that time was because he burned ghost money, so by rights, it shouldn't have caused any trouble. So, Zhou Ze was still thinking, which part went wrong?\n\nThe detention room was small. Zhou Ze was temporarily held in one room.\n\n「Boss, Boss, you're in here too!」\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to sit down, he heard Old Tao's voice from behind the bars opposite him.\n\nZhou Ze looked over at the sound, frowned, and said, 「Why are you in here too?」\n\nOld Tao's face was so wrinkled it was almost like a chrysanthemum. He said:\n\n「Boss, I'm just unlucky! I went to buy equipment for you, and it turned out the seller was a smuggler who just got caught by the police. When I went to buy that stuff and described it, they thought I was preparing to manufacture drugs.\n\nThen they arrested me and kept asking me about the specific process. I explained it was a misunderstanding, but they didn't believe me. They also asked who I was buying the equipment for, so I could only say it was you. They wouldn't even let me call outside to notify you.」\n\nZhou Ze understood. So, this mess fell on Old Tao.\n\n「Couldn't you just buy that stuff from a school or a laboratory supply store? Why did you go to a smuggler?」\n\n「Uh, wasn't I thinking of buying some good equipment for you, Boss? This humble Taoist also saw what you brought yesterday; it must be very precious, good stuff. And you value it so much, so of course, this humble Taoist had to choose better equipment for you.」\n\n「Thanks a lot,」 (sarcastically).\n\n「So what exactly was that stuff?」 Old Tao's curiosity also piqued. He didn't take it too seriously anyway, believing that 「the innocent will prove themselves innocent,」 and misunderstandings would eventually be resolved.\n\n「I had Lin Ke move it. That thing can't fall into the wrong hands, otherwise, it'll cause big trouble.」\n\nNo matter what, the Other Shore Flower must not be obtained by ordinary people, or it will brew immense disaster.\n\n「From underground?」 Old Tao pointed downwards.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n「Oh, this humble Taoist understands,」 Old Tao suddenly realized. So it was something from Hell.\n\n「Let's wait. We'll probably be released soon,」 Zhou Ze said.\n\n「Mm, after we get out, I'll go straight to a school to buy the equipment for you, Boss, and you can continue making it,」 Old Tao said.\n\n...\n\nInside the monitoring room,\n\nThe video and audio were simultaneously transmitted here.\n\nSeveral police officers stood there watching and listening.\n\n「Bureau Chief Sun, you still have the best methods. Indeed, putting two suspects together, they're bound to reveal some clues. I was worried they'd coordinate their stories before,」 a police officer said.\n\nOne of the older police officers took a deep breath, slammed his palm on the table with a hint of indignation, and scolded:\n\n「What kind of work have you been doing?!\n\nYou actually let the suspects transfer the drugs out before the raid! Have the search results from that bookstore come out yet? Did you find no evidence at all?\n\nFurthermore, there's actually an underground channel in Tongcheng that provides raw materials for drug manufacturing to criminals, and we haven't discovered anything at all! This is a disgrace to Tongcheng's police force!\n\nAlso, didn't you just hear? The suspect is counting on us not finding any leverage against him, and he's even thinking of going back to continue manufacturing drugs after his detention period ends!\n\nInvestigate this,\n\nInvestigate it thoroughly,\n\nFind out the full truth!」\n\n---\n* Ah Sir: A term of address for police officers in Hong Kong and parts of southern China, often used informally.\n** Emperor Kangxi in disguise: A reference to the popular Chinese TV series \"Kangxi's Incognito Travel\" (康熙微服私访记), where Emperor Kangxi travels in disguise to observe his kingdom.

    "content": "Boss Zhou had no idea how deep the misunderstanding with the police officers had become. He also lacked any awareness of anti-surveillance skills. In his previous life, he had emerged from the orphanage with a clean slate, toiled like a model worker to build his own life, and never once entered a detention center. This life, however, he had been in twice. The last time was right after he transmigrated, and it was Dr. Lin who came to pick him up.\n\nHe remembered chatting with a guy next to him then, about how that woman was quite good-looking, and so on and so forth…\n\nWhen the police brought Dr. Lin to Zhou Ze and said, \"Your wife is here to pick you up,\"\n\nZhou Ze was utterly bewildered.\n\nHe sat down on a bench. It was a bit cool underneath, but Zhou Ze wasn't afraid of the cold. At this point, Zhou Ze noticed that it seemed only Old Dao and he were held together; Old Xu wasn't detained here.\n\nThis truly was an undeserved misfortune, its cause and progression both bearing a comically frustrating effect.\n\nJust then, the detention center gate opened, and two police officers pushed in a food cart. Each detained person received a box meal and a bottle of mineral water.\n\nThe box meal quality was decent, with two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes. The police officers even asked if there was enough food, adding that there was plain white rice available for refills.\n\nOld Dao specifically asked for two box meals and ate them with great relish.\n\nZhou Ze opened his box meal, picked up his chopsticks, and poked at the meat pieces a few times. He simply had no appetite.\n\nThe thing Bihuan was making hadn't been completed yet, and he hadn't brought any sour plum juice. Under these circumstances, asking Zhou Ze to eat was truly asking too much of him.\n\nA police officer nearby noticed this scene, a hint of displeasure on his face as he said, \"So picky?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced back at him, said nothing, put down his chopsticks, opened the mineral water, and took a few sips.\n\nAn entire afternoon passed uneventfully. Old Dao had wanted to chat with Boss Zhou, fearing he might be bored, but seeing that Boss Zhou had no interest in talking, he simply leaned against the bars and began snoring.\n\nGiven Old Dao's life experience, entering a detention center was like returning home; he couldn't be more familiar with it. He ate well, drank well, and slept soundly inside.\n\nThe guys here spoke so pleasantly; he absolutely loved it here.\n\nBoss Zhou, meanwhile, sat leaning against the wall, dazing off, neither depressed nor anxious. He simply treated it as moving the sofa in his bookstore to a different spot, embracing a different kind of slacker life.footnote:[ \"Slacker life\" (鹹魚體驗, literally \"salted fish experience\") is a Chinese internet slang term referring to a lifestyle of lacking motivation or ambition, embracing a relaxed, \"lie-flat\" attitude.]\n\nBut no matter how much he embraced the slacker life, by nightfall, Boss Zhou couldn't sit still anymore. His routine had been very regular these past few days; at this hour, he should be sleeping, but without Bai Yingying beside him and no freezer here, he couldn't fall asleep.\n\nThe two police officers in the distance had already changed shifts. Of the two newcomers, one was constantly patrolling while the other sat there, seemingly reading a book.\n\nOld Dao was still snoring loudly, seemingly sleeping even more soundly than at home.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of The Count of Monte Cristo. He remembered that in the story, the Count of Monte Cristo apparently escaped by digging a tunnel. Although he had no tools around him, could he perhaps dig with his fingernails?\n\nBut instead of digging a tunnel, why not just pry open the lock directly with his fingernails?\n\nAnd those two police officers, he could probably…\n\nHis armor could block bullets, right?\n\nAs Boss Zhou was zoning out,\n\nA \"clank... clank...\" metallic scraping sound suddenly reached his ears.\n\nThe sound was like chains dragging on the ground, somewhat crisp, yet also muffled.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. Do they still use shackles these days?\n\nSurely not.\n\nHe looked towards the doorway and found that no one was being escorted in, but the \"clank... clank...\" sound continued incessantly, growing closer and closer.\n\nYet, the two police officers, and the other cellmates including Old Dao, showed no reaction whatsoever.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth and yawned. He understood; perhaps only he could hear this sound.\n\nWhat a sound only he could hear represented, there was no need to explain further.\n\nBut what puzzled Zhou Ze was, could such things exist even in a police station?\n\nHis middle school politics textbook clearly stated that the police were an armed state apparatus entrusted by national law, a state machine, beyond the reach of gods and ghosts.\n\nThis was also why Zhou Ze was unwilling to cause conflict and willingly got caught and brought in for questioning to clarify the situation. Firstly, he didn't want to ruin his previous bookstore life. Secondly, directly confronting the police was an unwise thing to do, even if he was a ghost messenger.\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze found it quite surprising that something \"unclean\" would appear even here.\n\n\"Clank... clank...\"\n\nThe sound came from far away and drew near, but it never truly materialized. Zhou Ze felt like a first-timer who had bought a ticket to a strip club, anxiously waiting for the performer on stage to quickly remove the two most crucial pieces of clothing.\n\nBut it just kept him itching with anticipation, just teasing him, rubbing on the outside without letting him in, deliberately scratching at his heart.\n\nAt this moment, Boss Zhou really felt an impulse to just break the lock and push open the door to peek into the corridor, to see which reckless powerful entity was causing trouble here.\n\nA police officer walked over, looked at Zhou Ze, who was gripping the bars and staring towards the exit, and sighed, saying,\n\n\"Leniency for confession, severity for resistance. Just confess everything you need to, and you can get out. At least you can find some peace of mind, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze completely ignored him, continuing to look towards the exit.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you. You're not very old, are you? About the same age as my son.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head this time, looking at the officer.\n\n\"Brother,footnote:[ \"Brother\" (大哥, dàgē) is an informal, often respectful, way to address an older man in Chinese. In this context, it carries a slightly cheeky or familiar tone from Zhou Ze.] you're really not suited for political education work.\"\n\n\"Hey, it's fine. Let's just chat casually.\"\n\nThe police officer actually sat down on the ground, sitting across from Zhou Ze through the bars, as if ready for a heart-to-heart talk.\n\nBut Boss Zhou's attention was mostly drawn to the sound of chains from the corridor. At this point, he had no mind to entertain this person.\n\nMoreover, this officer was being insincere. Zhou Ze had noticed him the moment the shift changed. He carried a potent aura of righteousness, especially the national emblem on his police cap, which seemed to be truly glowing in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nWould a police officer like this be relegated to being a detention guard?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't naive enough to think that any random guard chosen from the police station would be a hidden master disguised as a sweeping monk.footnote:[ \"Hidden master disguised as a sweeping monk\" (深藏不露的掃地僧) is a common trope in Chinese martial arts fiction, referring to someone who appears ordinary but possesses profound, hidden abilities.]\n\n\"Hey, let me be straight with you. I've heard about your case. I know you're married, and you have your own family. So, we didn't notify your wife about this incident;\n\nYou might also have been misled. In fact, many people like you who manufacture drugs are just tools of drug trafficking organizations. There's really no need for you to take the fall for them. As long as you can tell us everything you know, you'll have a chance to atone for your crimes by rendering meritorious service.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand dismissively, somewhat impatiently.\n\n\"You've really got it wrong. I don't make drugs, and I've never touched that stuff. This is just a small misunderstanding. I just wanted to buy a simple set of equipment to make orange crystal powder to mix with water.\"\n\n\"Don't be so resistant, and don't be so quick to deny. Just calm down and think carefully.\" The officer continued to gently persuade him.\n\nPerhaps, in his view, Zhou Ze was young, his resume was simple, and he should be an easy target for a breakthrough.\n\nBut he couldn't possibly know that Boss Zhou was someone who had already died once. Not to mention he hadn't done such ridiculous things; even if he had, given Boss Zhou's temperament, how could he be easily swayed by a few words?\n\n\"Think about it. We've already noticed you this time. Evidence will be found sooner or later. If you don't want others to know, don't do it. There are deities three feet above your head, right?\n\nBesides, you know the harm drugs cause. When you do so many immoral things, aren't you afraid of going to hell?\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"We're just chatting casually. It's not an interrogation anyway, and there won't be any recordings, so it's easier for me to talk.\" The police officer coughed.\n\n\"Let me be honest with you,\" Zhou Ze said helplessly.\n\n\"Speak, I'm listening.\" The police officer subtly made a gesture, signaling his colleagues monitoring the surveillance cameras to pay attention, while he himself listened attentively.\n\n\"This is really just a misunderstanding. You've checked my background; you should know my wife's family is very wealthy. Also, you arrested my employee, Mr. Xu, from the bookstore. You can check; he owns over twenty properties.\n\nIn this day and age, whether you run a physical business, innovate, or do anything else, how can it be faster and more stable than real estate?\n\nThat guy over there in the Taoist robe alone has funded hundreds of students in mountainous regions, and a single livestream can bring in hundreds of thousands of yuan.\n\nAre we so bored and full that, with all this money, we'd go around manufacturing and trafficking drugs?\"\n\nZhou Ze felt he had spoken from the heart.\n\nHis meaning was also very clear:\n\nWe guys don't lack money.\n\nEven Boss Zhou, the least wealthy among them, if he were to swallow his pride and flatter his father-in-law, could get money. Or, more simply, if he could con some burial artifacts from Bai Yingying and sell them as antiques, he could live comfortably without worries.\n\n\"Hmmmm............\"\n\nThe police officer had clearly investigated the circumstances of these individuals.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nAfter listening to Zhou Ze's words, he nodded, signaling that what he said indeed made a lot of sense.\n\n\"You see, right? We all have money, and we're not lacking it. How could we be so utterly bored that we'dfootnote:[ \"So utterly bored that we'd\" (閒得蛋疼, literally \"so bored that one's testicles ache\") is a vulgar colloquialism implying extreme boredom leading to doing something unnecessary or foolish.] go and commit illegal and disorderly acts? Are we tired of living comfortably?\n\nThe logic doesn't hold up.\"\n\nA rather amused expression appeared on the police officer's face as he said,\n\n\"Actually, that's not the strictest logic, especially when it comes to you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"For example... that bookstore you opened near Nanda University, it's been losing money, hasn't it?\n\nSo, based on that, we can completely re-evaluate your motive.\n\nFor instance,\n\nA person who would open a bookstore in prime real estate, a bookstore that is definitely losing money,\n\nIt also seems plausible that he would manufacture and traffic drugs,\n\nBecause perhaps your starting point and original motive weren't about making money at all,\n\nMaybe it was just for thrills, for fun...\n\nDon't you agree?\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze suddenly felt that this police uncle's words made a lot of sense:\n\nLogical,\nClearly structured,\nAppropriately illustrated,\nDifficult to refute;\n\nDamn it,\nit made Boss Zhou himself start to wonder if he really was dealing drugs?\nOtherwise, why would he open this bookstore?\nAfter renting the Xu family's shop on South Street back then,\nwhy still open a bookstore?\nJust because that idiot Xu Le opened a bookstore, I have to open one too?\nI could open \"Magic Finger Heaven\"*, \"Blue Sky and Water\"**, or \"Heaven on Earth\"***.\n\n\"See, I was right, wasn't I?\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze's expression, the police uncle thought he had been moved, so he continued to strike while the iron was hot:\n\n\"Actually, I can understand you young people's way of thinking. After all, it's different from our time. When I was little, conditions were still very tough. I could afford to eat, but eating meat every meal was difficult. So back then, I just wished I could have meat every meal. Unlike you, when this generation grew up, living conditions were much better, so you started thinking about doing something.\"\n\"But..................\"\n\nThe police officer was still doing ideological work, but Zhou Ze suddenly heard a \"clank-clank\" sound right next to him.\n\nZhou Ze stood up abruptly, his gaze sweeping around, but he could only hear the sound, yet he couldn't \"see\" anything at all.\nThis is impossible,\nThis is simply impossible!\nThere's a ghost that I \"can't see\"?\nA ghost messenger who can't see ghosts is like a barber who only cuts hair for bald people; isn't that nonsense?\n\nThe earnest police uncle, seeing Zhou Ze suddenly stand up, thought he had been persuaded and finally decided to confess. He was instantly excited, stood up with him, and was just about to say something more when he saw Zhou Ze pacing back and forth inside the cell.\n\n\"Clank-clank............Clank-clank............\"\n\n\"Hey, are you alright?\" The police uncle was stunned for a moment. He began to suspect if Zhou Ze's drug addiction was acting up. Wasn't his previous urine test fine?\n\nBut in reality, Zhou Ze was constantly changing his position, following the sound of the chains.\nThe sound of the chains dragging on the ground was right beside him, just outside his cell; it was walking right there!\n\nFinally, the sound of the chains \"walked\" towards the exit.\nZhou Ze immediately walked to the lock mechanism, his hands instinctively grasping it.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still restrained himself, not choosing to forcibly unlock it and leave with his own strength, but this feeling was really unpleasant.\nA lead!\nIt just walked around in front of him,\nand then left!\nIt was like a beautiful woman stripping naked and dancing for an hour in front of you, then saying \"Sorry, I'm on my period\" and leaving, leaving you distraught in the wind.\n\n\"Hey, are you alright? You don't have to pretend to be crazy or stupid. I didn't see any history of mental illness in your records!\" The police uncle thought Zhou Ze was trying some trick.\n\n\"Your mom............\"\nZhou Ze almost blurted it out,\nbut he took a deep breath,\n\"How's your mother doing?\"\n\n\"............\" The police uncle.\n\n\"Think about it carefully. If you confess now, it'll count as self-surrender, truly, and you might even get a meritorious service reward.\" The police uncle took out his ID and said, \"My name is Zhang Yanfeng. Tell me as soon as you've thought it through.\"\n\nThe middle-aged police officer sighed, went over to pick up a water cup and took a sip, then turned around helplessly and left the detention center.\n\nZhou Ze stood still. No one noticed that on the inner side of the iron bars, Zhou Ze had already scratched out a series of \"grooves\" with his fingernails.\n\nImmediately after,\nZhou Ze simply sat back down.\n\n\"Boss, you've been wronged.\"\n\nThe old Taoist across from him had woken up when the police uncle started his ideological lecture. Seeing Zhou Ze's reaction now, he thought his boss wanted to get out.\n\nZhou Ze glared at the old Taoist, annoyed.\nUltimately, all this mess was caused by the old Taoist. Zhou Ze usually kept his hands clean; even for minor matters that might cause trouble, he would burn some ghost money.\nBut this time,\nthe old Taoist landed him in big trouble.\n\n\"Boss, we'll be out tomorrow. We didn't do anything, and the police won't find anything. You need to control your 'chicken'****.\"\n\nThe old Taoist was genuinely worried that his boss might just unlock the cell and rush out of the police station, which would mean the bookstore and everyone's lives would be ruined together.\n\n\"Go to sleep.\"\n\nZhou Ze was too lazy to say anything more, leaning back against the bars, then asked again:\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Old Taoist, do you know anyone in the police station?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" The old Taoist was momentarily confused. \"Boss, do you like it here too? Let me tell you, the food at Tongcheng Detention Center is actually quite good. Rongcheng's isn't bad either, since they're big cities. The most annoying ones are the detention centers in small local police stations; the food there isn't as to my taste as it is here........\"\n\n\"You should just shut up.\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally intended to come back and check after this whole thing was over and he was out, to see if he could find the owner of that chain sound, but the old Taoist clearly misunderstood.\n\n\"Guangzhou's detention centers are the worst; you know, Guangzhou's weather is humid, tsk tsk, it's really uncomfortable staying in detention centers there........\"\n\n\"If you don't shut up, I'll unlock this and strangle you first.\"\n\n\"............\" The old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately shut up and started to chicken out.\n\nZhou Ze listened attentively. He couldn't sleep anyway. But unfortunately, the sound of the chains didn't reappear until dawn.\n\nIn the morning, a few police officers came over, unlocked the cell, and gestured for Zhou Ze to come out.\nZhou Ze and the old Taoist were taken into the interrogation room again. This time, however, they weren't asked anything; they just signed a document, made a statement, and then Zhou Ze was told he could leave.\n\nThe overnight stay at the detention center was over.\nWhen Zhou Ze walked out, Xu Qinglang and the old Taoist were already waiting outside. They had gotten out a bit faster than Zhou Ze.\n\nXu Qinglang handed Zhou Ze a cigarette, freshly bought and newly opened.\nZhou Ze took the cigarette, not in a hurry to leave, but sat down by the flower bed at the police station's entrance.\n\n\"They probably didn't find any evidence, so they had no choice but to let us out,\" Xu Qinglang said with a smile.\n\n\"The way you say that, it's as if we really did something unspeakable,\" Zhou Ze said, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\n\"Heh, are there really that few unspeakable things going on at our bookstore?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n\"Should I call a taxi?\" The old Taoist took out his phone, ready to hail a cab.\nSince they were out, it was natural to go back to the bookstore early. The old Taoist wasn't worried about the bookstore's business; its business was always in that pathetic state anyway. What he was worried about was his monkey.\n\nThe monkey was very smart; it would never show its face as long as there were customers in the shop.\nWhen the plainclothes police came in yesterday, they naturally didn't find the monkey. If it had been discovered, even if Boss Zhou wasn't manufacturing drugs, there would still be trouble, as that monkey was quite a high-grade species, a protected national animal.\n\n\"Wait.\"\nZhou Ze flicked off the cigarette ash and looked back at the police station again.\nZhou Ze hadn't figured out the chain sound from yesterday yet, and it was bothering him.\n\nThe police station, a place even Zhou Ze, a ghost messenger, wasn't very willing to enter. Because of this, Zhou Ze had a premonition that what he had encountered yesterday might be a big catch.\n\n\"What's wrong, Old Zhou, a little reluctant to leave?\" Xu Qinglang teased.\n\n\"Let's go back first,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old Taoist hailed a taxi, and soon a ride-hailing car stopped. The three got in together.\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang sat in the back, while the old Taoist sat in the front passenger seat.\n\n\"Are you police officers?\" the driver asked while driving.\n\n\"Suspects.\"\nThe old Taoist stated bluntly.\n\n\"............\" The driver.\n\n\"Hey, don't shake your hands! Suspects just have suspicion, you know? Even though when I watch legal programs, I find it quite a mouthful when criminals are called 'criminal suspects' or 'suspects'—wouldn't 'criminals' be simpler?—now that I think about it, it's quite fitting. The three of us are the kind the police wanted to catch but couldn't because of insufficient evidence, understand?\"\n\nThe old Taoist explained.\nBut the driver's hands trembled even more.\n\n\"Even if someone is caught in the act of committing a crime, as long as they haven't been convicted by a People's Court, they are still considered a criminal suspect, understand?\" Xu Qinglang lectured the old Taoist.\n\n\"Oh, I get it. You're the expert,\" the old Taoist chuckled.\n\nThe driver's face began to twitch.\nIt wasn't that the driver was timid, but damn it, these two echoing each other were putting too much psychological pressure on him.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Boss, should I go get that equipment for you this afternoon? The police are still watching, you know. It'd be too troublesome if they arrested us again for drug manufacturing to question us.\"\n\n\"I'll figure out a way to get it myself.\" Zhou Ze was also afraid of this trouble, so he planned to take the wine jar out and find a laboratory to extract it.\n\n\"Alright, it's time to move locations. I estimate there'll still be plainclothes officers watching our shop entrance for a while,\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\nThe driver swallowed. He really wanted to stop mid-journey and let these three people out, but he was still a little afraid.\n\nIn a daze, the Audi in front suddenly slammed on its brakes. The driver, in a moment of inattention, didn't have time to brake and drove straight into it.\n\n\"Bang!\"\nThe two cars rear-ended each other.\n\nActually, encountering drivers who like to needlessly slam on their brakes on the road is really annoying, but generally, in rear-end collisions, most of the responsibility lies with the rear car, because Module 1 of the driving test states that one must maintain a safe distance. However, then again, with the traffic congestion in most Chinese cities nowadays, maintaining a strictly defined safe distance is often not very realistic.\n\n\"How are you driving?!\" The old Taoist was enraged. Getting into a car accident right after being released from the detention center—what bad luck!\n\nAt this moment,\nthe door of the Audi in front opened.\n\nThe old Taoist gloated a little, \"Alright, the car owner's coming to find trouble with you.\"\n\nBut to everyone's astonishment, after getting out of the car, the male driver didn't come over to cause trouble; instead, he bolted forward, running faster than a rabbit.\n\nThis surprised all four people in the car. The driver called the traffic police from inside the car; no matter what, he needed the traffic police to handle it first.\n\nThe old Taoist, meanwhile, opened the car door first, got out, and walked to the front to take a look.\n\nAt this moment, the rear door of the car that had been rear-ended suddenly pushed open,\nand a woman, tied with ropes, fell out of the car.\n\n\"Oh, sis, playing cosplay?\"\nThe old Taoist watched from the side and said.\n\nThe girl sat calmly on the ground and began to free herself from the ropes. After she had untied them, she reached up and took out the strip of cloth stuffed in her mouth.\n\n\"I had my car stolen in the parking lot and was also kidnapped. Just now, because the car was rear-ended, he ran away,\" the girl said to the old Taoist.\n\n\"Hahahahahahahahahahah............\"\nThe old Taoist clutched his stomach and burst out laughing,\n\"Sis, you're really funny. Your joke isn't funny at all. Don't worry, even though you slammed on the brakes for no reason, a rear-end collision is the fault of the rear car.

    "content": "Traffic police arrived, and so did the regular police. After all, a kidnapping had occurred. Although the plot was absurd and nonsensical—even Stephen Chow's movies probably wouldn't dare use such a storyline for fear of being panned by audiences for insulting their intelligence and having no logic—it genuinely happened.\n\nPerhaps when the news first spread on Weibo and Tieba, many people might have scoffed at it with the phrase, \"A picture at the start, everything else made up.\"¹\n\nBut when the truth truly emerged, it was enough to leave a large crowd utterly astounded.\n\nCoincidentally, the \"guard\" who had given Zhou Ze a political education lecture just last night also appeared here, looking very much like a police chief assigning tasks.\n\nHis name seemed to be Zhang Yanfeng, Zhou Ze still had some impression of him.\n\nRight, how could a police officer with such a righteous aura be just a lowly guard?\n\nHe also saw Zhou Ze, then deeply frowned and walked over.\n\nZhou Ze had just finished a simple statement. In reality, the case was already very clear; the police had obtained surveillance footage of the suspects and identified them. All that remained was closing the net to make arrests.\n\n\"We meet again.\" Zhang Yanfeng reached out and lightly patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. He was a germaphobe and strongly disliked unfamiliar people making physical contact with him.\n\nSo, when Officer Zhang removed his hand, Zhou Ze even deliberately reached up and patted his own shoulder where he'd been touched.\n\n\"............\" Officer Zhang.\n\n\"I'll say it again, I didn't manufacture drugs,\" Zhou Ze repeated helplessly.\n\nHis bookstore truly didn't engage in any illegal or disorderly conduct. Moreover, Zhou Ze was a lazy person; if something could be solved by calling the police, he would absolutely not handle it himself. He had no interest in playing observer or engaging in extra-legal judgments.\n\nHe believed that the People's Police were absolutely just and served the people. Furthermore, with the convening of the 19th National Congress, the conduct and regulations of police personnel were continuously improving and progressing, already becoming a solid force and strong guarantee for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics!\n\n\"Whether you did or not, we will continue our investigation,\" Officer Zhang said.\n\n\"But I quite like the environment of the detention center,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nOfficer Zhang froze for a moment, then immediately said, \"May I interpret that as a provocation?\"\n\n\"No, it's like how many literary youths say a trip to Tibet can purify the soul. I feel that entering a detention center once can also calm one's restless heart.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Officer Zhang offered a forced smile.\n\nZhou Ze shrugged. No choice. He couldn't exactly say, \"It seems there's a ghost in the police station's detention center. How about I catch ghosts for you for free?\"\n\n\"I have your business card. I'll contact you in a while to chat. I hope we can chat in the detention center,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You're most welcome.\"\n\nZhou Ze told the Old Daoist to hail another taxi. Regardless, they should go back first. He was a bit tired and wanted to go back to the bookstore to sleep and rest.\n\nHowever, due to the incident, there was some traffic congestion here, so the three of them had to walk a certain distance before they could get a taxi.\n\nBoss Zhou yawned as he walked. Just then, a \"clink-clank\" sound rang out beside his ear.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly stiffened, stopping all movement, and just listened intently.\n\n\"Clink-clank............clink-clank............\"\n\nYes,\n\nIt was the sound of that ankle chain dragging on the ground.\n\nVery close,\n\nVery close,\n\nRight beside him!\n\nIt came out?\n\nFollowed him out of the police station?\n\nAnd in broad daylight!\n\nSo disrespectful, so brazen?\n\nHowever, just like last night, Zhou Ze still only heard the sound but saw nothing tangible. This feeling made Zhou Ze very uncomfortable and unaccustomed.\n\nHuman fear comes from the unknown. These invisible things that can only be imagined are the most tormenting, just like how the most terrifying scenes in horror movies aren't when the ghost jumps out to fight you, but rather the stage when the main characters are walking through a gloomy environment with oppressive music playing before the ghost appears.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\nZhou Ze extended his hand, signaling the Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang to stop.\n\nThe Old Daoist looked at Zhou Ze somewhat bewilderedly, and Xu Qinglang did the same.\n\nEven Zhou Ze couldn't see the thing, let alone the two of them.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze stopped,\n\nthe sound of the chain suddenly disappeared too, as if it had gone far away.\n\nBut mysteriously, Zhou Ze could imagine that a fellow with an ankle chain had just passed by him.\n\nWhere was it going?\n\nWhat was it going to do?\n\nA departed spirit that could still move freely in a place like a police station—what kind of existence was this?\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the mindset of chasing a big catch; instead, he began to worry whether this thing would cause damage to society or harm the innocent.\n\nJust as the little loli couldn't retreat when facing the ghost samurai at the hot spring resort, this was a matter of duty. The Underworld might not care about you low-level ghost officials killing and making extra cash, but if you failed to do your duty, the Underworld had specialized methods of punishment.\n\nLooking around, Zhou Ze noticed a proctology hospital diagonally opposite.\n\nWell, out of an instinctive feeling, places like hospitals and schools always seemed prone to ghosts. Zhou Ze subconsciously walked towards the hospital entrance.\n\nThis hospital wasn't large, just a single building, considered a small specialist hospital.\n\nUpon reaching the hospital entrance, Zhou Ze sat down on the steps.\n\n\"Help me block the view,\" Zhou Ze said to the Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang beside him.\n\nThe two nodded. Although they didn't know what Zhou Ze intended to do, they still chose to cooperate.\n\nZhou Ze's right fingernails grew longer, and at the same time, wisps of black energy began to swirl around. Then, Zhou Ze touched his nails to the tiles on the ground, and the black energy also merged into the ground.\n\nBut this time, no black footprints appeared on the ground. This move had always worked like a charm for Zhou Ze before. He couldn't play tricks like the little loli, doing things like spirit leaving the body.\n\nPoof,\n\nand it was gone.\n\nPoof,\n\nand it was back again.\n\nBut he had his own methods of catching ghosts. However, surprisingly, not only could he not see this ghost, but its footprints also wouldn't appear.\n\nWhat exactly... was this thing?\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked down the steps. The problem had reached an impasse; if he couldn't even find the thing, how could he resolve it?\n\nHowever, just then, the \"clink-clank\" sound rang out again.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, clenching his fists. He was angry, truly angry. The other party was provoking and taunting him, completely disregarding him, a ghost official!\n\nNo matter how small a village official is, they're still a cadre, aren't they?\n\nBoss Zhou even felt the impulse that, at worst, he'd be paralyzed for another half a month to unleash a berserk attack and drag this arrogant show-off out.\n\nBut Zhou Ze also worried that even if he turned into a zombie, he still wouldn't gain anything from that thing. That would mean he wouldn't be able to do anything for the next half a month.\n\n\"Clink-clank............clink-clank............\"\n\nThe sound continued.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes and began to listen quietly with his ears.\n\nTo the left, the sound was clearer!\n\nOpening his eyes, the hospital building entrance was to the left. Zhou Ze directly pushed aside the Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang in front of him and rushed inside.\n\n\"Clink-clank............clink-clank............clink-clank................!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAs if deliberately teasing Zhou Ze, when Zhou Ze started running in that direction, the sound of the chain became more urgent again, its frequency increasing rapidly, as if the fellow was also running just ahead of him.\n\nThe Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang could only run behind Zhou Ze. Although they didn't know what Zhou Ze was chasing, they just ran along.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze didn't understand what he was chasing either.\n\nHe even started to wonder if what he was chasing was actually a ghost.\n\nIf it were a ghost, how could he not see it?\n\nCould it be some mountain spirit or wild monster?\n\nUsed a special illusion spell to make himself invisible?\n\nBut it was wearing shackles and chains?\n\nWith his previous experience of encountering that masturbating monkey, Zhou Ze had always maintained an extremely cautious attitude towards the existence of spirits and monsters. Regardless, Boss Zhou wouldn't foolishly rush in and risk his life like last time.\n\nThe sound continued to be urgent,\n\nconstantly echoing in Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nZhou Ze... Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze was almost out of breath.\n\nDamn Xu Le's body, its physical fitness was so poor!\n\nLittle did he know, who was it that ate little and spent all day lying on the sofa reading newspapers and drinking coffee, not even bothering to step out of the bookstore when there was nothing to do?\n\nAs they ran, they entered a dead end ahead; it was a wall, and to the left of the wall was a restroom.\n\nZhou Ze slowly slowed his pace.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nthe sound of the chain dragging also slowed. The other party must have also reached a dead end, slowed its pace, and was considering where to go.\n\nZhou Ze spread his arms and lunged forward. This action looked like a big idiot pretending a girl was hugging him, but it was the best method Zhou Ze could choose at the moment.\n\nThere was no sensation of touch, nothing. Zhou Ze turned into the restroom.\n\nThe hospital's restroom environment was quite good, with dedicated staff for cleaning, and the floor tiles had just been mopped.\n\nThis small restroom had three squat toilet stalls. Zhou Ze went from one to another, opening the doors, and even waving his hand inside, but still found nothing.\n\nDamn it,\n\nWhere did that thing go?!\n\nZhou Ze walked to the sink, turned on the faucet, splashed water on his face, and began to gasp for breath.\n\n\"Holy crap, Boss............were you running so urgently just to use the restroom?\"\n\nThe Old Daoist also ran to the restroom doorway at this point, hands on his hips, gasping for breath.\n\nImmediately after, the Old Daoist even took out half a pack of tissues and handed them to Zhou Ze: \"Want some?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer, continuing to splash water on his face.\n\n\"Then I, the humble Daoist, will relieve myself first.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist first touched his crotch, pulled out a talisman, and stuck it on the sink's mirror. Then he walked to the urinal, unzipped his fly, and began to relieve himself.\n\nIt was unknown how he developed the habit of hiding talismans in his crotch. According to Xu Qinglang's teasing remark, it was because the Old Daoist had almost had his yang energy drained by a female ghost during a dabaojian² session in the past. Hiding talismans in his crotch was his last line of defense, just in case.\n\nZhou Ze wiped the water droplets from his face with his clothes and walked to the restroom doorway, waiting for the Old Daoist to finish.\n\n\"What exactly happened?\" Xu Qinglang asked, standing at the doorway.\n\n\"I don't know............\"\n\nZhou Ze answered while looking back at the restroom.\n\nBecause he had distanced himself from the sink's mirror,\n\nhis reflection in the mirror suddenly became smaller but also more complete.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze froze.\n\nIn the mirror, where the Old Daoist's talisman was stuck,\n\nhe clearly saw,\n\naround his feet,\n\nwrapped a long, thick, rusted chain.\n\n---\n¹ \"A picture at the start, everything else made up\" (开局一张图，其他全靠编 - kāijú yī zhāng tú, qítā quán kào biān): An internet meme originating from forums, implying that a story starting with just one image and no further evidence is likely fabricated.\n² \"Dabaojian\" (大保健 - dàbǎojiàn): Literally \"big health care\" or \"full-service massage.\" This term often functions as a euphemism for sex work or illicit massage services in China.",

    "content": "On the flowerbed steps in front of the hospital, Zhou Ze sat silently, his gaze fixed on the tops of his feet.\n\nIn reality, at this moment, you couldn't see anything at all, nor could you even touch it, but the image in the mirror earlier had already explained everything.\n\nThis chain was indeed around his ankle, and the sounds he had intermittently heard before were actually caused by his own movements.\n\nBut one thing Zhou Ze didn't understand was that last night in the detention center, he had clearly heard sounds from the corridor outside first, which at least proved that the chain was not on his foot at that time.\n\nThis meant that in that brief moment when the sound of the chain suddenly appeared around him, someone, or rather, something, had bound the chain to his foot.\n\nAnd he himself was completely unaware. In fact, if Old Daoist hadn't casually stuck the talisman from his fly onto the mirror while peeing, he might not have realized at all that the chain he had been desperately running around searching for, was right there on him!\n\nHe hailed another taxi and returned to the bookstore, where Zhou Ze sat down behind the counter.\n\nHe wasn't in the mood to take a bath and then call Bai Yingying upstairs to their room to sleep with him, nor was he in the mood to tinker with any Underworld Flower sap, much less read newspapers, drink coffee, or sunbathe. From time to time, he would lower his head to look at the tops of his feet, then from time to time, he would raise his head to gaze at the sky. All in all, he was very dejected.\n\nOld Daoist recounted the story of the chain to Bai Yingying, who was utterly astonished after hearing it.\n\nMoreover, due to the boss's silence, everyone in the bookstore was also very quiet.\n\nThe bookstore door had been locked by Old Daoist. It wouldn't be convenient for any customers to come in at this time. As for ghosts, there was no difference to a ghost who wanted to enter, whether the door was open or closed anyway.\n\nHe poured himself a glass of water and got a handful of peanuts for Monkey. Old Daoist looked at the boss, who was still lowering his head, and suddenly felt like laughing.\n\nThis scene was a bit like The Emperor's New Clothes.\n\nThe boss said he had a chain on his foot, invisible and intangible. Wasn't that just a modern-day version of The Emperor's New Clothes?\n\nAfter returning to the bookstore, Zhou Ze retrieved the talisman from Old Daoist, found a mirror, and placed it on the floor in front of him. The mirror perfectly reflected Zhou Ze's feet.\n\nAt the same time, a rusted chain was revealed. It existed, genuinely existed, undeniably existed.\n\nOld Daoist initially leaned over to look, and Xu Qinglang and Bai Yingying also gathered around to observe, as if examining a curious new item.\n\nAt least for now, the chain seemed to have no other harm, besides annoying you.\n\nBut Boss Zhou, as the person involved, didn't see it that way. He didn't want his feet to be shackled. Even if he couldn't touch or normally see it, it was a persistent discomfort in his mind.\n\nMoreover, looking at the image reflected in the mirror with the talisman attached – the filthy rust, the goosebump-inducing pits – it was even more unbearable for Boss Zhou, who had a cleanliness fetish.\n\nHonestly, if the chain were made of pure gold, or pure silver, or even had a trendy, anti-design style, Boss Zhou might feel a little better; at least it wouldn't be like having thorns in his back right now.\n\n\"Boss, could it be because you've been identified as a criminal, which is why shackles appeared on your feet? Do you remember that suicidal teacher from back then, who wore the 'beast in human guise' tall hat? You couldn't get his hat off either.\" Bai Yingying speculated.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded beside her; it seemed there was indeed something to that.\n\nMany mouths can melt gold; human words are fearsome.¹\n\n\"Impossible, no.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, refuting the guess,\n\n\"What happened with that teacher really fermented online, and public sentiment was overwhelming. This time, it's just some police officers suspecting me; the scale is simply incomparable. This situation shouldn't arise.\"\n\nYes, because Zhou Ze could also confirm that this chain wasn't on him from the start; it had once moved from far to near.\n\nOld Daoist leaned over and pointed at the small mirror in front of Zhou Ze, saying, \"Boss, honestly, I think your chain is pretty cool. Just imagine, when you're going all out, that look...\"\n\nAs he spoke, Old Daoist let his arms hang low, his expression blank, and swayed a few times like a zombie. Then he pointed to the top of his own foot and said:\n\n\"If you had another chain on your foot at that moment, it would truly look exactly like Crazy Iori from King of Fighters in the arcades back then.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Old Daoist held his arms up, making an explosion of energy gesture. Immediately, as if his childishness hadn't faded or he was truly immersed in the atmosphere of playing arcade games back then, he waved his arms back and forth, muttering, \"Useless... Useless... Useless...\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his face, looking at Old Daoist, who was engrossed in his own world beside him, and spoke:\n\n\"Old Daoist, the bookstore floor...\"\n\n\"Ah, Deadpool just cleaned it.\" Old Daoist immediately responded. Since getting Deadpool, Old Daoist's work had become much easier.\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded, continuing:\n\n\"Isn't Tongcheng applying to become a Sanitary City? Go clean up the street outside our bookstore. It's what we citizens should do.\"\n\n\"...\" Old Daoist.\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze was staring at him and didn't seem to be joking, Old Daoist could only pick up the broom and mop with a bitter expression and walk out of the bookstore to clean.\n\nBai Yingying crouched beside Zhou Ze, massaging his calves with both hands. Pouting, she asked, \"Boss, what do you think the reason could be? Is someone framing you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'm a bit baffled myself right now, so I've decided to go back to the detention center and take another look.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze took out the business card Zhang Yanfeng had given him last night and dialed the number on it.\n\nThe call was quickly answered, and a low voice came from the other end:\n\n\"Hello, who is this?\"\n\n\"The one who went into the detention center yesterday.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What do you want to talk about?\"\n\n\"I want to go in again today, can I?\"\n\n\"Are you willing to confess your crimes?\"\n\n\"I have no crimes.\" Zhou Ze repeated.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze patiently said, \"To be honest, I'm a writer. Staying in the detention center last night made me feel very inspired, and I hope...\"\n\n\"Beep, beep, beep...\"\n\nThe other party hung up the phone.\n\nBoss Zhou looked at his phone, suddenly feeling a sense of bewilderment.\n\nThen, looking at Old Daoist \"huffing and puffing\" cleaning the street outside, he actually felt like karma had come so quickly.\n\nZhou Ze could only dial back. The other party answered again, but this time, there was no immediate speech from their end.\n\n\"I want to go back to the detention center. I have my reasons, although I know this request is a bit unrea—\"\n\n\"Clank... clank... clank...\"\n\nA sound came from the other end of the phone, a familiar sound. Because it was transmitted over the phone, the sound was a little distorted, but Zhou Ze was certain that the sound was coming from that side.\n\n\"Go on,\" Zhang Yanfeng urged, as if lighting a cigarette, seeing that Zhou Ze had stopped speaking.\n\n\"Have you recently experienced insomnia with many dreams, physical weakness and sweating, or aches in your lower back and legs?\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe other party seemed ready to hang up again.\n\n\"Have you ever dreamed of having shackles on your feet?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe other party froze, not hanging up the phone. It seemed that this sentence had struck a chord with them. A moment later, a response came from the other end of the line:\n\n\"Come to the bureau and find me. I'm in my office.\"\n\n...\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze appeared in Zhang Yanfeng's office, it was already evening. Zhang Yanfeng was sitting behind his desk, eating the food he had brought from the cafeteria, wolfing it down while looking at the case files in front of him.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze entered, he pushed the food and case files aside, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I want to hear about the ankle chain.\"\n\n\"I feel it's a bit inappropriate to discuss such superstitious matters with you in this environment, in this place, and while you're wearing your police uniform.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'm off work.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later, Zhang Yanfeng, now in plain clothes, walked out of the police bureau with Zhou Ze. The two walked to a small park diagonally opposite the bureau, found a long bench, and sat down.\n\n\"You don't have to regard me as a police officer now, just as an ordinary person. Let's have a chat.\" Zhang Yanfeng even proactively offered Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\nTheir relationship changed quickly. Before, Zhou Ze was behind iron bars and he was outside, but now, they both seemed to have become friends. \"Cellmates,\" you could say.\n\nZhou Ze held a small mirror in his hand, with Old Daoist's talisman still stuck to it, and placed the mirror on Zhang Yanfeng's foot.\n\nThe streetlights in the park weren't very bright, a bit dim, but one could still faintly see the image in the mirror: on Zhang Yanfeng's foot, there was also a shackle, though this shackle wasn't as thick or as long as his own.\n\nHis own was still thicker and longer.\n\nWhy did that sentiment feel so strange?\n\n\"Did you see it?\" Zhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nZhang Yanfeng's hand, holding the cigarette, trembled slightly.\n\n\"This is the first time I've properly seen it. Before, I only often dreamed of having an ankle chain on my foot, for over twenty years now.\"\n\n\"So, have you ever done anything with a guilty conscience?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My conscience is clear; I am worthy of the police uniform I wear every day and worthy of the national emblem on my police cap,\" Zhang Yanfeng stated emphatically. \"I've even slowly grown accustomed to these intermittent dreams. In my dreams, I walk around the police bureau wearing shackles, and I feel it's more like a constant warning for me. It constantly reminds me that my authority comes from the people and from the nation, so I absolutely must not cross the line. If I take even one wrong step, these shackles will truly appear on me in the future.\"\n\n\"Clap, clap, clap...\" Zhou Ze clapped softly beside him,\n\n\"So, this should be a disguised affirmation, like a hero's medal. Only good people get this chain?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"Let's first resolve a lingering historical issue.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze aimed the mirror at the top of his own foot, and a thick, long iron chain appeared in the mirror,\n\n\"Now you can believe I haven't manufactured drugs or engaged in illegal activities, right?\"\n\nWe're all the same.\n***\n¹*Many mouths can melt gold; human words are fearsome (众口铄金，人言可畏): This idiom suggests that collective slander or widespread public opinion, even if unfounded, can have a powerful, destructive effect, likened to many mouths collectively melting metal.

    "content": "When you feel like you're the sole victim, you'll be at a loss.\n\nYou'll believe Heaven is singling you out, that you've been abandoned and isolated by the entire world and society.\n\nBut when you discover there's another equally unlucky person beside you, you'll feel much more comfortable, thinking Heaven isn't so bad after all, at least it left you a companion.\n\nThis is human nature. Most people who grew up in the countryside probably heard their grandmothers tell them not to play near ponds or rivers when they were little. They'd warn you that a child once drowned there and became a ghost, wanting to pull you down to be a substitute ghost.\n¹\nThese were merely words to scare children away from dangerous areas, but it's precisely this kind of down-to-earth language that often reflects many simple yet profound truths.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\nNot flustered anymore.\n\nNot flustered anymore.\n\nHe had worried before if these chains would have any subsequent harm.\n\nBut seeing that the police officer beside him, who possessed a majestic aura of righteousness, also had them, he wasn't afraid or worried at all.\n\n\"What do you do?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\n\"That's inconvenient to tell you. Let me put it this way: both your work and mine are dedicated to socialist modernization and striving for social harmony.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng frowned.\n\n\"If you encounter a difficult case to handle in the future, you can come to my bookstore and ask me to take a look. That's all I can say. Knowing too much about some things might not be good for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Zhang Yanfeng's shoulder.\n\n\"Keep being a good police officer. That's good.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze withdrew his hand,\n\nZhang Yanfeng also reached out and patted his own shoulder area.\n\nThe two exchanged a smile.\n\n\"I don't believe in ghosts or gods in this world. I never have.\"\n\n\"Keep holding onto that belief.\" Zhou Ze let out a long breath. \"Just consider my visit tonight a dream. We can now cut to the chase. Tell me about this chain of yours. When did that dream start?\n\nRight, you seemed to say before, it's been over twenty years?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded. \"Yes, it's been over twenty years. My father was also a detective. Our family, you could say, is a police family. My son is currently studying at the police academy.\"\n\n\"Impressive.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't think this was nepotism. Who would be bored enough to use nepotism to get their whole family to become police officers, let alone detectives?\n\n\"I remember that year, it was the year my father sacrificed his life.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng spoke calmly.\n\nZhou Ze listened calmly as well.\n\n\"At that time, I had just started working for less than two years. My father's sacrifice was a huge blow to me. To be honest, I felt a bit disheartened, and also a little afraid.\n\nI was truly afraid. I was afraid that one day, I too would sacrifice my life.\"\n\n\"Police officers are human too,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"But it's different, truly different. I felt ashamed of my fear.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng flicked the ash from his cigarette and continued:\n\n\"The first time I had that dream was also that year. I stayed up all night processing case files and fell asleep in the office. That night, I had a very, very long dream. Even now, that dream is so vivid; I can even remember every scene from it.\n\nI was standing in a cold corridor,\n\nhearing the sound of chains dragging on the ground.\n\nThat place was cold, truly cold. The most profound coldness I've ever experienced in my life was that time, and it was in a dream, heh heh.\"\n\nBoss Zhou dug in his ears. He slept every night hugging Bai Yingying, the female zombie.\n\nHe was long immune to the word \"cold.\"\n\nA normal person couldn't endure the chilling aura Bai Yingying emitted, but Zhou Ze relished it.\n\n\"I saw a person in white clothes walking from a distance. He walked very slowly, step by step;\n\non his feet were ankle shackles, chaining his ankles. Every step he took, the chains on the ground would clank as they dragged.\n\nThat sound has constantly echoed in my dreams for over twenty years since then.\n\nHe walked from a distance,\n\npassed in front of me.\n\nI couldn't see his face clearly.\n\nHis hair was messy.\n\nBut when he walked up to me, I no longer felt cold; I even felt a sense of warmth.\n\nThen, he left. He seemed not to have seen me at all, continuing forward until he reached the end of the corridor;\n\nthen,\n\nhe vanished.\n\nAfter that, I woke up from the dream.\n\nThere was no drama, no turning points. Actually, it was a very ordinary dream, but precisely because that dream was too real, so real that it felt as if it had truly happened, I've always remembered it, for over twenty years.\n\nAfter that, whenever I dreamt again, no matter what I was doing in the dream, no matter what kind of dream it was, this ankle chain would be on my leg.\n\nThat chain, which should have been on the person in white's feet, appeared on me.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng took a deep breath, then heavily exhaled it.\n\n\"I once, due to work convenience, asked a psychologist, but his answer wasn't very satisfying to me. Do you know what he said?\n\nHe said it was because I had a guilty conscience, that I was afraid, afraid of when I would be exposed or when something would go wrong, haha...\"\n\nAt this point, Zhang Yanfeng chuckled, threw his cigarette butt on the ground, and forcefully stepped on it.\n\n\"I, for one, have lived my life worthy of the national flag and the police emblem, you know? On the day of my father's funeral, he was wearing his police uniform, and he was draped in the national flag.\"\n\n\"I believe you.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Officer Zhang. Honestly, he reminded him of the bureau chief who had bought books at his bookstore before.\n\nIt's like on Weibo: when news breaks of urban management officers bullying people or beating up old ladies, there will be countless reposts and comments. But when firefighters or police officers die in the line of duty, the number of reposts is few and far between.\n\nIn reality, there are still more good people in this world; otherwise, society would have fallen into chaos long ago.\n\nThe two remained silent for about a quarter of an hour, then Zhou Ze actively broke the quiet.\n\n\"I need to find a way to solve this matter.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the top of his foot, then stood up.\n\nAcross from this small park was the police station. Zhou Ze suddenly asked:\n\n\"When you had that dream over twenty years ago, was it also inside this police station?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the police station wasn't this big back then. About ten years ago, it was renovated and rebuilt.\"\n\n\"The address hasn't changed, right?\"\n\n\"No change.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Can you draw?\"\n\n\"No,\" Officer Zhang answered very bluntly. \"You want me to draw the scene from that dream?\"\n\n\"Yes, I hope for a more intuitive representation.\"\n\n\"There are experts in this area at the bureau; I can call him over.\"\n\n\"Won't that affect his rest?\"\n\nIt's not early now.\n\n\"Young people, they need more tempering,\" Zhang Yanfeng replied.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nZhou Ze seemed to see himself in his previous life, drilling interns to death.\n\nThey didn't return to the police station; this was Zhou Ze's request. He always felt it was strange to discuss such dubious matters inside the police station, and that place always had a vague pressure suppressing him.\n\nThe group went to a coffee shop next to the police station. The young police officer also arrived with his laptop, his face covered in acne, looking very callow. He first walked up to Zhang Yanfeng and greeted him:\n\n\"Hello, Captain Zhang.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded.\n\nThen the young police officer looked at Zhou Ze and asked, \"How should I address this person?\"\n\n\"Suspect.\"\n\nZhou Ze introduced himself.\n\n\"............\" The young police officer.\n\nZhang Yanfeng glanced at Zhou Ze, then gestured for the young police officer to sit beside him.\n\nNext, the young police officer opened his laptop and began drawing according to Zhang Yanfeng's description.\n\nThis was quite eye-opening for Zhou Ze. In many people's eyes, police officers are all criminal investigation experts, but in reality, the police force, especially in recent years, has seen an increasing number of other professional talents join.\n\nIt's like how that once-notorious financial fraudster was absorbed into the FBI after being caught and imprisoned years ago.\n\nWhile the young police officer was busy,\n\nZhou Ze was playing on his phone nearby.\n\nAbout two hours passed.\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded, signaling that it was almost done, then turned the laptop towards Zhou Ze, pointing to the screen and saying:\n\n\"This is pretty much the scene.\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at the screen for a while.\n\nA person in white, wearing ankle shackles,\n\nwalking numbly forward.\n\nOn both sides were pitch-black things, and behind him was also a stretch of darkness.\n\nThis was an extremely narrow space.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng and said, \"Can you recall any more details?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhang Yanfeng was a bit confused.\n\n\"For example, here and here.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the two sides of the image. \"These two sides are walls, but what is this dark area beyond them? If it's a wall, why doesn't it extend directly?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but I remember the walls in that dream place were discontinuous, not a single continuous stretch.\"\n\n\"So, according to Captain Zhang's narration, I emphasized the distinction between light and shadow here,\" the young police officer explained from the side. \"I originally wanted to draw this whole area as extending walls, but Captain Zhang said it wasn't like that.\"\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze was very concerned about the dark shadows beside the walls on both sides, while he didn't particularly focus on the person in white clothes wearing ankle shackles.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head, deep in thought.\n\nHe thought of the scene in the detention center, the sound of chains coming closer from afar, and himself standing behind bars, pacing back and forth, trying to find his traces...\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze seemed to have thought of something, directly pointing at the dark areas on both sides of the screen and saying:\n\n\"This isn't a wall, could it be iron bars?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze gestured with his hand. \"Have you seen old movies? Those old-fashioned prisons, do you have an impression?\"\n\nThe young police officer immediately turned the laptop back and began revising, while Zhang Yanfeng beside him fell into deep thought.\n\n\"Is that it?\"\n\nSoon, the young police officer pushed the laptop towards Zhou Ze and Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nOn the screen,\n\nthe originally pitch-black blurry areas were changed to iron bars. Inside was still black and blurry, but with these bars added, the entire image instantly became clear and three-dimensional, and even the message it contained was immediately revealed.\n\nIn a narrow prison corridor,\n\na prisoner dressed in a white prison uniform,\n\nwith shackles on his feet,\n\nwas walking numbly forward.\n\nBeside him were other prison cells; perhaps, there were many eyes watching him from inside.\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately picked up the phone. Zhou Ze didn't know who he was calling, but Zhang Yanfeng's voice was very clear, and he didn't avoid the two people present:\n\n\"Old Wang, it's Zhang Yanfeng. Can you immediately help me check what our police station's location used to be?\n\nDidn't you tell me before that the old police station was renovated and built upon an old building? Help me check this, check exactly what place it was and what it was used for before.\n\nWhat? You need a more specific request?\n\nAlright then,\n\nyou check,\n\nif it used to be,\n\nduring what period,\n\nused as a prison?\"\n\n---\n¹ **Substitute ghost (替死鬼, tìsǐguǐ):** In Chinese folklore, a spirit of a person who died tragically (e.g., by drowning) that seeks to lure a living person to their death in order to take their place in the afterlife and gain release from their tormented state.",

    "content": "\"Captain Zhang, what exactly are you investigating? Is it an unjust case? I can help you look into it in detail.\"\n\nThe junior officer seemed very eager.\n\n\"Xiaoliu, it's getting late. You should go home and rest early. You still have to work tomorrow,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\nThis matter originated from a dream of his, and he couldn't possibly let more people know about it. Besides, to be honest, the repercussions wouldn't be good.\n\n\"It's fine, Captain Zhang, I'm not tired, I can...\"\n\n\"You're tired,\" Zhang Yanfeng reminded him.\n\n\"Oh, uh, okay, I'm tired. Alright then, Captain Zhang, I'll be going now.\"\n\nThe junior officer left with his notebook.\n\nZhou Ze sat nearby, silently lighting a cigarette. Truly, from Zhang Yanfeng, he seemed to genuinely see his past self. Back then, Doctor Lin admired him, but he felt nothing at all. He had the same approach towards his subordinates.\n\nBy some strange impulse, Zhou Ze asked, \"Is Officer Zhang still single?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded.\n\nHeh,\n\nHow similar.\n\nGetting back to business, Zhang Yanfeng's gaze was serious as he reached out and lightly tapped on the tabletop, saying,\n\n\"Actually, based on that scene, I instinctively felt it was somewhat familiar. It bears great similarities to some film, television, and literary works.\"\n\n\"I understand what you mean: chains, prison uniforms, walking step by step through a narrow corridor, surrounded by other cells, everyone's gaze either numb or angry, watching all of this. If you took out a phone and played 'Tears Behind Iron Bars' at this point, it would fit the atmosphere even better.\"\n\n\"You think so too?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng's expression was still serious. In fact, beneath this seriousness was a hidden awkwardness and discomfort. Having been a police officer for most of his life, discussing such mystical things with someone who was previously a suspect in his eyes felt very strange to him, and full of a sense of incongruity.\n\nActually, Officer Zhang's psychological resilience was quite strong. Ordinary people experiencing this for the first time would likely be scared out of their wits, but he could still force himself to calm down.\n\n\"If it were heroic spirits or martyrs from the past, for example, being escorted to the execution ground for execution, that logic certainly makes sense. It often appears in film, television, and novels, and those martyrs are indeed very admirable.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused for a moment, blew out a smoke ring, then pointed his finger at his foot, saying,\n\n\"But would the souls of martyrs, with nothing better to do, put a chain on your foot and mine? Is this a free souvenir? Or a loving encouragement? And I'm a good person, you're a good person too. Okay, my description sounds a bit childish, but right now we can only infer based on this logic. Under the premise that we are both good people, would heroic spirits of martyrs put a shackle on us? Doesn't make sense, doesn't make sense at all. It's not like going to a scenic spot or a temple where locals force you to buy souvenirs and put them on you without a word.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded. For an old detective like him to analyze the thoughts of ghosts was indeed a bit beyond his professional scope, but actually, humans and ghosts operate on the same thought process.\n\nIf they really were heroic spirits of martyrs, they shouldn't be that bored, right? Blessings shouldn't come as chains.\n\nZhang Yanfeng's phone rang again. He answered the phone, and after a while, he said to Zhou Ze,\n\n\"The former site of our police station was once a hospital. It had been a hospital since the Republican era. After the Liberation, it was abandoned for a period and used as a 'tube building' for resident resettlement. Later, it was renovated into a police station on this foundation, and ten years ago it underwent another demolition and reconstruction. No record of it ever being used as a prison was found.\"\n\nZhou Ze fell into deep thought. Generally speaking, departed souls and obsessions are certainly located at their initial positions. For example, if a person died unjustly in a place, if a vengeful spirit were to form, it would certainly be active at that spot.\n\nMoreover, both Zhou Ze and Officer Zhang had chains put on them inside this police station. This also indirectly proves that the original trigger point of the incident is within this police station.\n\n\"Never been a prison?\" Zhou Ze was somewhat unable to comprehend. The situation in Zhang Yanfeng's dream had been described very clearly; at that time, it really should have been a prison.\n\n\"I'll go back first and investigate more thoroughly. You know, this kind of information isn't available online; you have to go through the archives.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng picked up his phone and the cigarettes on the table, said his goodbyes, and left. As he walked out of the coffee shop, he looked up and let out a long breath.\n\nToday's events made him afraid to think too much, and unwilling to, even including Zhou Ze himself.\n\nBut this matter still needed to be dealt with. After all, this chain had appeared intermittently in his dreams for over twenty years, and he couldn't possibly give up this opportunity due to some mental fastidiousness.\n\nTurning his head, Zhang Yanfeng glanced at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting in the coffee shop, and shook his head. He suddenly felt that the person inside was terrifying, yes, terrifying.\n\nThis was no longer a police officer's gaze upon a suspect, but the gaze of someone outside looking at someone inside. The lives and surrounding landscapes of the two might truly be worlds apart.\n\nZhang Yanfeng wasn't sure if he could ever come back out once he delved into it.\n\nShaking his head, he walked towards the police station.\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, took a taxi and returned to the bookstore half an hour later.\n\nThe bookstore was closed today, closed during the day and also closed at night. The boss had some trouble, and the employees were worried about the boss and had no mind to work.\n\nThis feeling,\n\nwas like middle school students saying, \"Our homeland hasn't been reunified yet, I really can't focus on studying.\"¹\n\nThat's how they explained it,\n\nHowever:\n\nOld Taoist was doing a livestream, Monkey was holding his phone for him, constantly thanking the boss for the planes and rockets!\n\nXu Qinglang was lying behind the bar counter, with a face mask on, listening to music, humming happily, utterly at ease.\n\nBai Yingying was upstairs playing \"chicken dinner.\" Recently, she had bought a Kakao server account, reportedly had no hacks, and was having a blast.\n\nEven Deadpool, who had always been sitting downstairs, returned to his room to continue sitting.\n\nLooking at his employees, Boss Zhou appeared somewhat listless. He hadn't slept for two days, so he went straight up to the second floor. After returning to his bedroom, he lay down on the bed.\n\nJust thinking about the rusted iron chain wrapped around his ankle made him feel very uncomfortable and ill at ease. He tossed and turned endlessly.\n\nBai Yingying very tactfully ended her game and also lay down on the bed, letting Zhou Ze rest his head on her upper thigh.\n\nThen she began to gently massage Zhou Ze's head.\n\nZhou Ze finally felt sleepy, slowly closed his eyes, and fell asleep.\n\n………………\n\nDrip...\n\nDrip...\n\nDrip...\n\nThis was the sound of water,\n\nvery clear,\n\nand very empty and echoing.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes and found himself lying on the surface of the water. The familiar pool of water, the familiar road in the distance, and on the road, densely packed departed souls tiptoeing.\n\nBack here again?\n\nHe hadn't dreamed in a long time, had he? Especially after having Bai Yingying sleep next to him, his sleep quality was indeed much, much better than before.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously glanced down into the pool. Revisiting an old place, he always wanted to see if that old nemesis was still there.\n\nThe water in the pool was very clear, the kind of truly crystal clear water, without any exaggeration, where you could see to the bottom. Looking down, not a single trace of the Faceless Woman's presence could be seen.\n\nIt seemed she really died in Rongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath,\n\nBut at this moment, he saw his own shadow behind him in the reflection of the pool. He immediately turned around, only to find a woman standing less than a meter behind him, a woman whose hair completely covered her face.\n\n\"You're not dead?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, somewhat puzzled.\n\nThe woman didn't answer, but continued to stand there.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman slowly raised her head. Although her eyes were hidden beneath her thick hair, Zhou Ze could feel that the other party was staring at him:\n\n\"That question, I should be asking you... Where are you... going?\"\n\n\"Gurgle... Plop...\"\n\nZhou Ze only felt the pool beneath him, which had originally been as solid as an ice surface, suddenly churn and pull downwards, and he himself fell into the pool.\n\nInstantly,\n\nan overwhelming sense of suffocation surged over him, as if countless hands were desperately covering his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, making him lose all perception of the outside world.\n\nThe only impression was the other party's last question lingering in his ears.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously sat up. Had he woken up from the dream? Perhaps because he was a \"ghost,\" he always dreamed of returning to hell, but who was that woman earlier, dressed like the Faceless Woman?\n\nListening to the other party's voice, it didn't seem to be the Faceless Woman.\n\nWhat exactly happened that day in Rongcheng, Zhou Ze wasn't clear on the details. Little Loli considered that day a taboo. She was unwilling to say more. Zhou Ze also tried asking, but Little Loli's reaction at the time was that she wouldn't recount the events of that night even if she were killed, so Zhou Ze gave up.\n\n\"Yingying...\"\n\nZhou Ze spoke,\n\nwanting Yingying to pour him a glass of water,\n\nbut he froze.\n\nHe wasn't lying on the bed in his bedroom on the second floor of his bookstore,\n\nbut on a worn-out straw mat.\n\nBeside him, there were densely packed people in ragged clothes, either leaning against the walls or lying there. When he made a sound, the others were also looking at him.\n\nThe dream hadn't ended,\n\nhe hadn't woken up yet,\n\nNo,\n\nwhen Zhou Ze looked up and saw the iron bars in front of him,\n\nhe realized,\n\nnot only had the dream not ended,\n\nbut this dream,\n\nhad just begun.\n\n\"Clatter... Clatter...\"\n\nIn the distance,\n\nthe sound of iron chains dragging and scraping across the floor could be heard.\n\nIt was so familiar.\n\nZhang Yanfeng said that ever since that dream, for over twenty years, in every dream, chains were wrapped around his ankles.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously lowered his head,\n\nlifted the ragged clothes beneath him,\n\nWhere are the chains?\n\nWhere are my chains?\n\nWhy don't I have chains???\n\n---\n¹A common humorous excuse used by Chinese students to justify not studying, implying that important national matters distract them.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze silently observed his surroundings. He knew this should be a dream, but this time, he finally understood Zhang Yanfeng's description of that dream—real.\n\nYes,\n\nthis dream was truly real.\n\nEverything, you could see clearly.\n\nIts reality manifested in the details:\n\ntemperature,\n\nhumidity,\n\nlight,\n\nwithout the slightest haziness characteristic of a dream. In fact, it appeared overly clear and distinct. You merely glanced casually, but you could clearly remember how many bricks were there, including their textures and abrasion marks.\n\nCold, damp, oppressive. This place was like the deepest part of a nightmare, a corner within an abyss. The environmental factors were secondary; the most crucial aspect was the people sitting or lying in this confined space.\n\nTheir expressions,\n\ntheir gazes,\n\nthat numbness, that blankness,\n\nadded the most profound despair to this place.\n\nThe air was permeated with a nauseating stench.\n\nYou could no longer pinpoint the source of the stench to a single item. It was a mixture, an unimaginable, scalp-tingling blend.\n\nThe smell of urine, the smell of pus, and other putrid odors emanating from humans, including the stench of corpses, all mingled together.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head.\n\nThis environment truly made him uncomfortable. Staying for even a second was torture.\n\nEven if this was a dream,\n\nhe hoped to wake up.\n\nTo hell with clues,\n\nto hell with traces,\n\nto hell with the truth.\n\nI won't stay in this place, not even if it's a dream!\n\nBoss Zhou was quite willful at this moment.\n\nHe closed his eyes, slowly imagining the sensation of floating up from underwater in his mind. Usually, if someone experiences a dream with sleep paralysis or a lucid dream, they can try this method to accelerate waking up.\n\nHowever,\n\njust then, a hand suddenly pressed onto Zhou Ze's forehead. And this hand was very foul-smelling; the strong, pungent odor directly assailed Zhou Ze's nostrils, stimulating his nerves.\n\n\"The fever... it's gone.\"\n\nThe speaker was a middle-aged man with messy hair and two scars on his face.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes, subconsciously reaching out to move the hand away from his forehead, but he suddenly found his body to be incredibly weak, to the point of an unimaginable lack of strength.\n\nHis hand could only fall halfway up, and he felt a dizzy spell.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine. The fever's gone, no big deal.\"\n\nThe man opened his arms and embraced Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou now hated this damned reality.\n\nWhy make it so real?\n\nIs there any point?\n\nThe skin-to-skin contact beyond the tattered clothes was now so clear. The grime and filth accumulated on the man's body seemed to even have a lubricating effect.\n\nEvery detail, every point of contact,\n\neven the damp warmth of the other's breath on his face,\n\nall carried a nauseating despair!\n\n\"Still cold?\"\n\nthe other asked, his voice gentle.\n\nZhou Ze listened carefully to the other's accent, which had a Sichuanese flavor. In short, it wasn't a Tongcheng local accent.\n\nBoss Zhou really wanted to curse, but he wanted even more to end the current awkwardness quickly. He shook his head, wanting to speak, but the words wouldn't come out. He was too tired, too tired to make any sound from his throat.\n\n\"Clank... clank...\"\n\nThe sound of chains rang out, growing closer.\n\nThe people in the cell, who had previously looked like mummified corpses, suddenly became agitated. They each crawled up, all swarming to the iron bars, gripping them with both hands and looking outside.\n\nLike villagers on market day, everyone gathered to watch the excitement.\n\n\"Clank... clank...\"\n\nCloser,\n\nvery close,\n\nthe person in leg shackles was coming!\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to crawl up and see. This should also be the scene Zhang Yanfeng saw in his dream, but it seemed either he was seeing it more realistically than Zhang Yanfeng, or he and Zhang Yanfeng were simply not observing from the same perspective.\n\nGet up,\n\nget me up!\n\nHe'd smelled the stench,\n\nexperienced this filthy place,\n\nand even been hugged by a man.\n\nIf he didn't get up to see the specific situation, Zhou Ze felt all this suffering would be for nothing, and he'd be at a huge disadvantage.\n\nHe gave the man in front of him a meaningful look, signaling him to help him up to see.\n\n\"Your fever just broke. Lie down for a while. I'll go take a look.\"\n\nWith that, the man gently settled Boss Zhou on the ground. This area was padded with thicker straw, making it softer than other spots.\n\nBoss Zhou simply lay there, looking up at the cell ceiling.\n\nAnd now, throughout the entire cell,\n\nincluding the man who had been with him earlier,\n\neveryone was crammed by the iron bars, craning their necks to look outside,\n\nlike a group of rabid fans chasing a star.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze,\n\nalone,\n\nlay there isolated and motionless.\n\nZhou Ze felt like an idiot, somewhat like an extra, and this extra had no lines, was a dead body. And when the camera switched to another location, the damned director wouldn't even let him get up, forcing him to continue playing dead.\n\nNo one spoke,\n\nno one made a sound.\n\nDamn it!\n\nCan't watch live,\n\ncan't even listen to the audio?\n\nZhou Ze cursed again in his mind. He really wanted to close his eyes right now and shatter this dream, without any interference, so he could wake up.\n\nHe should be lying on Yingying's lap, sleeping sweetly, and if he woke up, he could even have Yingying make him tea.\n\nWhy was he still lying in this place dirtier than an outhouse?\n\nBut Zhou Ze was a bit unwilling. He had endured the hardship and been taken advantage of; was he just to come and go empty-handed?\n\nAlso, he remembered Zhang Yanfeng saying that dream, he remembered it very clearly because it was very real, but he only had that dream once.\n\nSo,\n\nit was very likely,\n\nZhou Ze would only have this one chance.\n\nI'll endure.\n\nI'll keep enduring.\n\nZhou Ze's mind began to recall his \"suspended animation\" state after the car accident in the final stage of his previous life.\n\nRecalling the experience of being made up and then pushed into the crematorium,\n\nnow,\n\nit didn't seem so unbearable anymore.\n\nThe breathing of the onlookers grew coarser and heavier.\n\nTheir breathing held an eagerness and a longing,\n\nlike rutting male gorillas, snorting through their noses, almost thumping their chests and howling \"ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.\"\n\nDon't ask how Zhou Ze inferred so much from just the sound of breathing;\n\nafter all, what else could he study besides these slight changes in sound?\n\n\"Clank... clank... clank...\"\n\nComing,\n\ncoming,\n\nthe person dragging chains,\n\nslowly walked closer.\n\nAnd judging by the sound, Zhou Ze could confirm the person had reached the entrance of his cell.\n\nZhou Ze, using all his strength, turned his head.\n\nHe had to see,\n\ntake a look,\n\nhe absolutely had to!\n\nBut then,\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nHe could only see groups of men's backs at the bars; they had blocked the view completely, tightly packed.\n\nBoss Zhou couldn't even find a crack to peek through!\n\nFuck!\n\nZhou Ze kept roaring in his mind.\n\n\"Clank... clank... clank...\"\n\nThe sound faded from near to far, slowly elongating.\n\nThe person,\n\nmust have walked away.\n\nThey just left?\n\nDidn't say anything?\n\nShout a line like \"The door for humans to enter and exit is locked, but the hole for dogs to enter and exit is still open?\"\n\nZhou Ze had discussed with Zhang Yanfeng earlier that considering the environment at the time, the person in leg shackles was likely a martyr, one who would rather die than surrender. Although there were some contradictory issues, the probability of that possibility was truly high.\n\nNow,\n\nZhou Ze could, however, rule out his previous deduction.\n\nBecause after the person in leg shackles walked away, Zhou Ze didn't see anyone else in the cell feel sad or angry.\n\nOn the contrary,\n\ntheir faces were filled with envy and longing,\n\nas if they wished the person walking out in shackles was themselves.\n\nThis left Zhou Ze quite bewildered. What exactly did this mean?\n\nThe man turned back around and reached out to tidy Zhou Ze's hair.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nif Xu Qinglang were to do this action for him,\n\nhe might at most feel a bit uncomfortable, but it wouldn't be overly repulsive. But for this greasy, impossibly filthy fellow in front of him to do it, it made the nausea Boss Zhou had just managed to suppress rise up again.\n\nThis place,\n\nhe truly didn't want to stay for another moment.\n\n\"Sleep a little more. Dinner will be served soon. I'll get your portion for you.\"\n\nThe man said gently.\n\nBoss Zhou truly had no interest in eating; he couldn't even stomach normal food, let alone, just by looking at the environment here, you would already know what kind of grub these people were eating.\n\nHas the dream ended?\n\nHas it ended yet?\n\nZhou Ze was like someone who finished watching a movie but didn't leave after the credits, waiting for a post-credits scene.\n\nBut after waiting for a while, there seemed to be no post-credits scene.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to truly close his eyes and leave this dream,\n\nsuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze felt a sharp pain in his abdomen, as if something was kicking him in the stomach.\n\nFuck,\n\ndid I eat something bad?\n\n\"What's wrong? Are you in pain?\"\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze very anxiously, then reached out and touched Zhou Ze's stomach.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nJust then, rustling sounds came from over there again. A wooden bucket was placed outside; it must be food.\n\nThe man stood up and walked over.\n\nThe expected scramble for food did not happen. Everyone seemed to restrain themselves spontaneously, waiting for the man to take a broken bowl, scoop the first portion of food and soup, and walk back. Only then did the others start to scramble.\n\nDamn,\n\na prison boss?\n\nZhou Ze's bookstore had many \"Overbearing CEO Falls in Love With Me\" books, which many young girls loved to read.\n\nNow this was \"Prison Boss Falls in Love With Me\"?\n\n\"Come, sit up first, eat.\"\n\nThe man helped Zhou Ze up to sit against the wall.\n\nZhou Ze sat up,\n\nlowered his head,\n\nand found his stomach to be very, very distended.\n\nBloating?\n\nThis severe?\n\n\"You've worked hard, and so has the child in your belly,\" the man said apologetically.\n\nThe... child in my belly?\n\nFuck!\n\nThis was a woman's body?",

    "content": "Zhou Ze found it difficult to describe his current feelings; he only felt that everything was so absurd. Perhaps it was because he had just entered this dream, or perhaps an initial cognitive paralysis from identifying with it, but Zhou Ze had truly never doubted his own gender.\n\nIt was only now that he had a sudden realization.\n\nOf course, in this context, \"sudden realization\" was a derogatory term, at least for Boss Zhou. Most normal men probably wouldn't wish for a day of such \"sudden realization\" for themselves.\n\nFortunately, this awkwardness and dilemma didn't last too long, because soon, \"Gurgle... gurgle...\" sounds began to bubble up again.\n\nZhou Ze initially let out a long sigh of relief, thinking the dream was about to end.\n\nWhether passively or actively, he should be waking up and returning to his warm bed, to the soft lap of a high school girl.\n\nIt was like attending a charity event on a scorching day; you'd feel bad about bailing, but if someone suddenly announced the event was over, you'd just go with the flow, drop your tools, and head in for some air conditioning and an iced Fanta, not wanting to shout that you could keep going, no problem.\n\nMost people would probably have this mindset.\n\nBut soon, Zhou Ze realized something was wrong with the water sounds. They weren't coming from beside him, nor in his ears; they were coming from *inside his belly*!\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nZhou Ze had been single in his previous life and hadn't gotten Doctor Lin pregnant in this one, so he theoretically didn't know much about expectant mothers. But in fact, in his previous life as a doctor, he had handled many pregnant women in the ER, so he could be sure that a normal pregnant woman—oh no, even an abnormal pregnant woman's belly wouldn't make such sounds.\n\nAnd the water sounds grew louder and louder, like thunder, and his belly was twitching.\n\nEveryone else in the cell seemed to be caught in a time freeze; those fighting for food were frozen, those eating were frozen, all motionless. The man in front of Zhou Ze was also holding his feeding posture, unmoving.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nThe water was boiling.\n\nZhou Ze stared at his belly.\n\nHe instinctively sensed something.\n\nFinally,\n\nA fissure slowly appeared on his belly, slick and smooth. The sensation was like a surgical knife cutting open a belly on an operating table.\n\nZhou Ze felt no pain, but usually, he was the one performing surgery, cutting open bellies to find lesions. This time, it was his turn to \"experience\" this feeling from a first-person perspective.\n\nIt seemed that VR technology was being used by many to produce first-person VR sports romance films for profit, with excellent market prospects. At this moment, Zhou Ze thought this might also be a new business opportunity, for instance, launching such a VR experience to let all young husbands try it, so they could understand the hardships of their wives' childbirth.\n\nOf course, men definitely wouldn't want to experience this stuff, but they could focus on promoting it to women.\n\nAlright,\n\nBoss Zhou's thoughts were truly wandering terribly at this moment, much like during lovemaking or other painful experiences; you needed to distract yourself so you wouldn't be so focused.\n\nAfter all, Boss Zhou's own belly was slowly splitting open.\n\nThen, a small, tender white hand reached out from his belly, somewhat like Sun Wukong* emerging from a stone; you couldn't help but marvel at the miracle of life.\n\nHowever, in the next moment,\n\nA headless infant crawled out of Zhou Ze's belly.\n\nBoss Zhou took a deep breath. He had prepared himself mentally for everything, but the turn of events still further exceeded his mental preparation limit.\n\nEven the most brilliant directors and screenwriters specializing in dark aesthetics\n\nwould struggle to capture the present scene,\n\nentwining ethics and primal horror,\n\nthe radiance of new life and the shadow of death perfectly aligning at this moment.\n\nPerhaps due to professional habit, Zhou Ze noticed the infant's neck was very smooth and rounded, which meant the technique of whoever severed the head was exquisite.\n\n\"Ee-yah... ee-yah...\"\n\nNo head,\n\nyet still able to make sounds.\n\nChildish babbling, an innocent voice that should have sounded crisp and pleasant,\n\nbut at this moment, it became the most terrifying and sinister embellishment,\n\nno less effective than the low, ominous background music often heard in old horror movies, even producing a more horrifying and potent effect.\n\n\"Drip-drop... drip-drop...\"\n\nThe infant was still covered in thick bodily fluids. As he crawled up Zhou Ze's belly, the fluids dripped continuously onto Zhou Ze, the slimy sensation very uncomfortable.\n\nFinally, the infant crawled in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to light a cigarette right now, then act nonchalant and say, \"Come, let's talk.\"\n\nBut Zhou Ze couldn't even speak now.\n\nIn the past, encountering such a scene, Boss Zhou would instantly unleash his fingernails!**\n\nNo matter what great injustice you suffered, forcing a germaphobe like him to endure such suffering meant you deserved to be torn to shreds, not even given a chance to go to hell.\n\nIf that didn't work, he'd just unleash a rampage*** and see who had the last laugh.\n\nBut now, when under another's roof, one must bow one's head. Boss Zhou could only half-squint his eyes, watching the infant's next move.\n\n\"Ee-yah... ee-yah...\"\n\nThe infant slowly leaned back,\n\nalmost sitting his little bottom directly on Zhou Ze's chest, propping up his two little feet, as if deliberately showing Zhou Ze something.\n\nZhou Ze saw it.\n\nOn the infant's foot was a strand of thread, a highly viscous substance like glue, condensed from bodily fluids.\n\nBut from Zhou Ze's perspective,\n\nit looked like a chain wrapped around the infant's own calf.\n\nHe was showing off this chain to him,\n\nand seemed overjoyed.\n\n\"Are you behind this?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked in his mind.\n\nHe didn't know if the infant could hear him,\n\nbut this was the only way Zhou Ze could try to communicate right now.\n\nApparently, the infant couldn't hear. He continued to show off the \"chain\" on his leg, like a primary school student who scored a hundred on a test, running back to show off to his parents, hoping for praise.\n\nZhou Ze had never had children, legitimate or illegitimate; Boss Zhou had never had any in two lifetimes. But ironically, Zhou Ze's first experience of \"fatherly love as profound as a mountain\"**** was in this environment, in this scene.\n\nHe simply closed his eyes. He couldn't speak, and could barely move, but he could choose non-violent non-cooperation, right?\n\nBut the sensation on his belly was so clear, including the slimy, disgusting feeling of fluids dripping onto him. Even if he couldn't see, his own imagination wouldn't stop, making it almost the same as seeing it with open eyes.\n\nJust then,\n\na \"clank\" sound of an iron door opening seemed to come from afar.\n\nIt was like the spring thunder erupting, bringing all things back to life,\n\nor like the Dragon Seal***** before a movie begins, a green screen appearing with a dragon, finally displaying \"Film Censorship Permit\";\n\nThis meant the movie was about to begin,\n\nthe story was about to begin,\n\neveryone, please look forward to it.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes,\n\nand saw the infant, who had been fussing on his chest, slowly turn around and begin crawling back to where he came from.\n\nThis was an even more bizarre sight than his emergence.\n\nAn infant who had just crawled out of his mother's belly,\n\nwas slowly crawling back into his mother's belly,\n\nas if the incision, smooth and fluid like a surgical knife, came with a zipper effect.\n\nHe unzipped it,\n\nhe came out,\n\nhe went in,\n\nand zipped it back up.\n\nYes, that's how Zhou Ze felt at that moment, watching the wound on his belly slowly heal. This violent collision of reality and illusion, if experienced by anyone else as a first-person viewer, would probably have led to a mental breakdown long ago.\n\nEven an old detective captain like Zhang Yanfeng, in Zhou Ze's position, would likely be the same. No matter how excellent an ordinary person is, they have a psychological endurance limit, just as no matter how strong a person is, if they don't eat, they'll starve to death.\n\nFortunately, Boss Zhou's psychological defenses were indeed solid. In the past year, he had seen too many people and ghosts, plus he had a little loli by his side who would occasionally stick out a long tongue from her cute, adorable face, dramatically changing the mood.\n\nBoss Zhou was an experienced man.\n\nHe only found the scene disgusting,\n\nbut if you were to say that these visuals and the first-person experience could scare Boss Zhou crazy, then you'd be underestimating a Ghost Messenger too much. Living people can be scared to death by ghosts, but have you ever seen a Ghost Messenger scared to death by a ghost?\n\nThe frozen cacophony finally returned. The prisoners in the cell began fighting over food.\n\n\"Come, eat.\"\n\nThe man gently brought the bowl to Zhou Ze's face.\n\nIt was as if a movie had been paused halfway through and now resumed, the plot flowing smoothly again.\n\nZhou Ze kept his mouth closed; he wouldn't eat.\n\n\"Eat a little, Xiufen.\"\n\nZhou Ze still kept his mouth shut.\n\n\"Clang-clang... clang-clang... clang-clang...\"\n\nThe sound of chains came again,\n\nbut this time the sound was louder, and the dragging rhythm was faster. It wasn't like someone wearing them and walking; it was more like someone dragging them by hand.\n\nSuddenly, the prisoners who had been fighting over food all dropped their bowls and chopsticks and crowded to the bars.\n\nIncluding the man who had just fed Zhou Ze; he also put down his bowl and chopsticks and rushed over.\n\nA man in a black uniform walked over from the aisle, carrying two shackled chains.\n\nAll the prisoners in the cells along the way began shouting.\n\nThey were excited, they were agitated,\n\nthey,\n\nwere also longing.\n\nEveryone reached out as much as possible, like begging beggars, hoping for a share.\n\nThe man in the black uniform turned, looking around with the chains in hand,\n\nseemingly enjoying this feeling of being surrounded and anticipated.\n\nThen,\n\nhe slowly approached the cell where Zhou Ze was,\n\nand with a flick, he flung one of the two chains\n\ndirectly into the cell.\n\nImmediately,\n\nthe people in the cell became like wild dogs fighting over a bone, actually starting to brawl.\n\nThe man who had just fed Zhou Ze shouted:\n\n\"Give it to my wife, give it to my wife!\n\nShe's pregnant,\n\nshe has a child in her belly!\"\n\nShouting,\n\nhe also rushed into the fray.\n\n---\n*   **Sun Wukong (Monkey King) emerging from a stone:** A famous episode from the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, where the mythical Monkey King is born from a magic stone.\n**   **Unleash his fingernails:** This refers to Boss Zhou's supernatural abilities, which are often depicted as involving his hands and fingernails, making this a characteristic phrase for him taking aggressive action.\n***   **Unleash a rampage:** A gaming term, specifically from the *Musou* series (e.g., *Dynasty Warriors*), where a character takes on and defeats many enemies at once.\n****   **Fatherly love as profound as a mountain (父愛如山):** A Chinese idiom used to describe deep, unwavering paternal love.

    "content": "Many people have seen scenes of a group of stray dogs and cats fighting over food on a small path—that kind of struggle, that kind of scramble, sparing no effort, stopping at nothing.\n\nBecause animals know clearly that without food, they too are doomed.\n\nHumans have always prided themselves on being a higher existence, priding themselves on being the spirit of all beings;\n\njust like some Tongcheng people<sup>[1]</sup>, when called Subei people, will excitedly retort like a cat whose tail has been stepped on, yelping that they are from Suzhong, not Subei; this, instead, makes them seem even more ridiculous.\n\nMany years ago, humans also lived a life of eating raw meat and drinking blood, like wild beasts, but now, people often refer to some excessive actions as \"beastly acts.\"\n\nThey became civilized,\n\nbecame enlightened,\n\nand quickly wanted to distance themselves from their former \"companions.\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze watched this group of people fighting over the chain, they fought with complete abandon, completely absorbed in the scramble, people falling all over each other; the already poor air in the prison cell was further stirred up by clouds of dust they raised, making the air even worse.\n\nIn the end, one person stood up, holding the iron chain, his face bruised, his body covered in many contusions, and the corner of his eyebrow was broken open, with blood continuously dripping down.\n\nThis was the woman's man, the same man who had tenderly fed her before.\n\nJust like a lion going out to hunt food and bringing it back for its lioness to eat, he succeeded.\n\nThe black-uniformed person reached out and knocked on the bars,\n\nindicating that the iron chain had an owner,\n\nwhich also forced those around who were still itching to go up and fight for it again to give up their efforts.\n\nIn fact,\n\nwhen the food was first distributed, the other prisoners in the cell showed great restraint; they knew there was a pregnant woman in this prison.\n\nBut this didn't mean they would show mercy during the subsequent struggle for the iron chain; eating a bit later or a bit less wouldn't be a big problem, however, this iron chain meant something much more.\n\nThe man walked up to the woman with the iron chain,\n\nbent down,\n\nand put the iron chain on the woman's leg.\n\n\"Click.\"\n\nHe fastened it,\n\nthen he raised his head,\n\nlooked at the woman,\n\nand he smiled,\n\nsmiling very happily,\n\nThis smile, in Zhou Ze's eyes, was like that of an imbecile,\n\nAt the same time,\n\nhe had a deep sense of incomprehension,\n\nwhat this iron chain truly meant,\n\nand why these prisoners were so enthusiastic about it,\n\nbut one thing Zhou Ze could be sure of was that\n\nthis iron chain didn't seem to be something good,\n\notherwise, there wouldn't be a nightmare that still existed so many years later.\n\nThis dream was very clear, the details and logic were incredibly clear, but despite this, Zhou Ze felt that there was still a layer of impenetrable mist shrouding it.\n\nIt shrouded the truth,\n\nSometimes, the more real something is, the more it often implies falsehood.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth,\n\nHe wanted to say something, but his voice still couldn't come out from his throat, leaving only hoarse murmurs.\n\nThen,\n\nthe man helped the woman up, the black-uniformed person opened the cell, and several more black-uniformed people came over from the side; they took the woman from the man's hands.\n\nThe man subconsciously wanted to follow them out, but was pushed back in by two black-uniformed men.\n\nThen the iron bars were closed again, the man gripped the bars tightly with both hands, watching the woman, watching her belly.\n\nHe was still very happy,\n\nincredibly happy,\n\nextremely happy,\n\nso happy that Zhou Ze felt if he had the chance,\n\nhe'd want to run back and beat him up.\n\n\"Clang-clang-clang... clang-clang-clang... clang-clang-clang...\"\n\nThe sound of the iron chain scraped on the ground,\n\nZhou Ze was also walking,\n\nbut because this body was too weak, black-uniformed people were supporting him on both sides.\n\nWalking all the way,\n\nit was desolate and lonely,\n\nonly the sound of the iron chain scraping on the ground was so clear,\n\nand so grating.\n\nHowever,\n\nwhen passing other cells,\n\nZhou Ze saw a similar scene as before:\n\nThe prisoners in the cells gathered one by one at the iron bars, craning their heads, looking at Zhou Ze, looking at this woman with the iron chain bound to her leg.\n\nIn their eyes,\n\nthere was nothing but envy,\n\nthe kind of envy that wished they could take her place,\n\nwhen they heard the sound of the iron chain, they even showed expressions of enjoyment.\n\nAre these people out of their minds?\n\nBoss Zhou was now utterly perplexed, with a \"Black Guy Wondering\" expression???<sup>[2]</sup>\n\nWalk,\n\nstill walking,\n\ncontinuously walking.\n\nThis corridor was very long, and Zhou Ze walked very slowly;\n\nbut it was also clearly because the two black-uniformed people beside her were not using their full strength. If they wanted to, they could clearly drag this woman forward quickly in a matter of seconds.\n\nAlthough this woman was pregnant, Zhou Ze knew clearly that it was already a miracle she hadn't miscarried, given the nutritional and living conditions; in fact, she was very thin, just a little better than skin and bones.\n\nHer and her child being able to survive,\n\nwas truly not easy.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's view,\n\nthe black-uniformed people were deliberately walking this slowly;\n\nthey were like a procession,\n\nslowly accompanying the woman,\n\nas if escorting a champion to receive attention and cheers from others, seemingly deliberately trying to prolong this process.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze had another doubt:\n\nit seemed the direction was wrong.\n\nPreviously, the iron chain had moved from the right to the left from his cell's side, but this time, he was being helped to walk from left to right; Zhou Ze meticulously noticed this difference.\n\nNo matter how long the road,\n\nit eventually had an end.\n\nAhead,\n\nan iron door appeared.\n\nThe door was opened,\n\nand Zhou Ze was pushed inside.\n\nInside there was a table,\n\non which clean water and food were placed.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move;\n\nfor Boss Zhou to eat food without other condiments was truly no less than a torture.\n\nBut the next moment,\n\nan impulse surged in Zhou Ze's heart,\n\nZhou Ze began to reach out, desperately shoving food and water into his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze knew clearly that this was just a dream, and he was embodying the perspective of a woman.\n\nTherefore,\n\nit wasn't him moving,\n\nbut the woman's survival instinct compelling her to start eating, frantically eating, because she wanted to live, because she still had a child in her belly.\n\nShe knew clearly that her child needed nutrition.\n\nThe wolfing down lasted for a long time, but the woman seemed unable to eat enough; however, the black-uniformed man beside her directly stopped her, interrupting her continued eating.\n\nZhou Ze, having once been a doctor, knew clearly that during a period of extreme food deprivation, overeating excessively could easily lead to life-threatening danger.\n\nIn ancient times, there was a form of \"private torture\" in prisons, called \"prison death.\"\n\nIt meant keeping the prisoners constantly hungry, only giving them a small amount of food, so they wouldn't starve to death, but also ensuring they never ate their fill. Of course, this stage could be skipped; in ancient times, desiring a full meal in prison was also a delusion and a luxury.\n\nThen one day, suddenly, the jailers would set a table of good wine and delicious food before you, letting you eat your fill with abandon. After your belly was round and full, two jailers would come over, one on each side, one holding your head and the other holding your feet, and lift you up to play \"stretching exercises,\" tightening and straightening you for a bit.\n\nAfter going back and forth like this for a while, you would kick the bucket.\n\nThis method of death, at the level of ancient coroners' autopsies, would not reveal anything unusual; there were no other wounds on the body. Jailers typically used this method to extort illicit money by helping people settle scores in prison.\n\nHaving eaten her fill,\n\nher body seemed to suddenly regain some strength.\n\nA black-uniformed man walked in holding a water gun,\n\nand began hosing down the woman with the water gun.\n\nCold water gushed over, hosing her repeatedly.\n\nThe woman lay on the ground,\n\nwhimpering incessantly,\n\nBoss Zhou also became a drenched chicken along with her; this feeling was truly not pleasant.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nthe black-uniformed person brought a white long robe for the woman to change into, and pushed the woman, still somewhat damp but indeed much cleaner than before, out of the iron door again.\n\n\"Clang-clang-clang... clang-clang-clang... clang-clang-clang...\"\n\nThe iron chain continued to be dragged on the ground.\n\nThe path previously walked had to be walked again.\n\nZhou Ze was somewhat bewildered;\n\nCould it be that fighting for this iron chain was just to get a full meal and a bath?\n\nJust like scrambling for meal tickets or bath tickets?\n\nOn the way back, the people in the iron-barred cells on both sides still looked at Zhou Ze with envious eyes.\n\nContinuing to walk forward,\n\nthey walked to the cell where Zhou Ze had been held. The man who had fed her was also by the bars, looking at the woman; he was very agitated, very relieved, and very joyful.\n\nThis reminded Zhou Ze of a song by Rene Liu:\n\n\"Love you very, very much, so willing to let you, fly to a happier place...\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk forward, the iron chain still scraping the ground.\n\nThe black-uniformed men did not send him back to the cell he was in before, but continued walking forward.\n\nWalking, walking, they went up some stairs,\n\nwalking, walking, a carpet appeared,\n\nwalking, walking,\n\nanother iron door appeared.\n\nThe door was opened,\n\nand there was light inside,\n\nmaking one momentarily have the illusion of escaping to freedom.\n\nPeople who have never been imprisoned cannot understand the yearning for freedom while in jail, just as most people only truly realize how wonderful it is to be lively, healthy, and problem-free when they get sick.\n\nZhou Ze clearly perceived that,\n\nan agitated and joyful emotion arose in this woman,\n\nvery strong,\n\nto the point where her body was constantly trembling.\n\nShe actively walked inside,\n\nthe iron chain continued to drag on the ground,\n\nmaking the last sound lingering in this narrow space.\n\n\"Clang...\"\n\nAfter the person walked in,\n\nthe iron door was closed.\n\nAhead, it was covered by a white, shed-like structure, similar to those farmers use for growing off-season vegetables,\n\nand on both sides of the nearby area,\n\nthere were things resembling showerheads, with many small holes.\n\nIt was like a public bathhouse; as if the previous wash wasn't clean enough, and they had to wash again.\n\nThe woman's emotions continued to be agitated,\n\nand she was still slowly walking forward,\n\nbut after Zhou Ze saw the layout of the surroundings,\n\na terrifying gloom immediately descended,\n\nThe woman didn't know what this place was,\n\nbut he did!\n\nDamn it,\n\nGet out,\n\nMust get out,\n\nThis was no damned shower room at all,\n\nthis was purgatory,\n\na true living hell!\n\n---\n<sup>[1]</sup> Tongcheng, Subei, and Suzhong refer to geographical regions within Jiangsu Province, China.

    "content": "The bookstore was closed, but the lights were on inside.\n\nGenerally speaking, bookstores occasionally close during the day but are definitely open at night. But what can you do when the boss went to bed early tonight?\n\nSince the boss was passively slacking off, the employees under him were naturally happy to slack off too. Most importantly, without the boss intervening, even if customers came, they couldn't pack and send express deliveries for them, so it was better not to bother.\n\nOld Daoist and Xu Qinglang sat on the sofa, and on the coffee table beside them were two glasses of red wine.\n\nThe red wine was paid for from the bookstore's account and was not cheap. The entire bookstore was now permeated with a spirit of listlessness[1] and decay—a bad trend initiated from the top down.\n\nActually,\n\nAt first, everyone's enjoyment of food, clothing, and daily expenses was restrained, but after Boss Zhou's coffee and tea became increasingly high-end, those below naturally followed suit.\n\nAfter all,\n\nThe poorest person in the entire bookstore was enjoying such high-end things, so there was no need for us wealthy individuals to live shabbily, right?\n\nThe little monkey squatted on the bar counter, with peanuts laid out in front of it, happily eating by itself. It wasn't annoying, nor did it bother people; if someone wanted to play with it, it would play along, if no one wanted to play, it would play by itself—it was quite well-behaved.\n\nOld Daoist also bought it a 'tightening-hoop'[2] and a kasaya, and incidentally custom-ordered a Golden Cudgel from \"Some Taobao\"[3]. This was just Old Daoist indulging his mischievous sense of humor.\n\nTo think that Sun Dasheng (the Monkey King) was being raised by him—it really filled him with pride and satisfaction.\n\nThe boss also told him that when he fought the monkey three hundred rounds back then, the monkey's \"iron rod\" was truly terrifying.\n\nOld Daoist believed it,\n\nbut he didn't expect that the \"iron rod\" the boss mentioned wasn't the \"iron rod\" he had in mind.\n\nThe monkey didn't like the tightening-hoop or that stick, but it had a special fondness for the kasaya. When it had nothing to do, it would wrap the kasaya around itself like a cape, and surprisingly, it even exuded a hint of Buddhist nature.\n\nOld Daoist had been to Mount Emei before. The monkeys there weren't afraid of people, and would even actively approach tourists for food. If you were unlucky enough to encounter one of the monkeys' \"hot-tempered elder brothers,\"\n\nif you didn't give it to them, the monkeys would even try to snatch it.\n\nBut even so, the Mount Emei monkeys were still said to possess \"Buddhist nature.\"\n\nBut compared to his own monkey \"brat,\" they were truly far behind—his monkey could play on a phone, change songs, and even use Didi. Last time, the monkey \"brat\" even hailed a ride by itself to General Mountain to get the boss medical attention.\n\nTsk, tsk, tsk,\n\nAnyway, in Old Daoist's eyes, no matter how excellent other people's children were, they weren't as cute as his own.\n\nOld Daoist had said more than once that he had no children of his own in this life. Although he had sponsored many poor students, few of them called him on holidays to greet him or ask about his well-being. On the contrary, when he wasn't doing well and was short on cash, many would call to demand tuition and living expenses, and their words were unpleasant, as if it were his fault they couldn't leave the mountains because he owed them money.\n\nThis monkey, Old Daoist was raising it as his own grandson, after all, sometimes, animals understand gratitude better than humans.\n\n\"Life's pretty decadent, isn't it?\"\n\nOld Daoist took a sip of red wine, his eyes narrowed. He couldn't tell the quality of the red wine, so what he was actually savoring was how many RMB he had swallowed with that sip of red wine.\n\nThinking about the price, the taste of the red wine became apparent.\n\nAfter swallowing the red wine,\n\nOld Daoist stretched his old back, let out a soft sigh, and then said:\n\n\"Do you think there are still plainclothes officers watching our bookstore outside?\"\n\n\"Don't know.\"\n\n\"Don't you know spells?\"\n\n\"You know my level, just a half-full bucket[4].\" Xu Qinglang was quite honest. \"But you, your ancestors were also quite skilled, haven't you thought about picking up your spells and practicing?\"\n\n\"It's long been lost. What about you, don't you want to practice more?\"\n\n\"What's the point of practicing? Just living comfortably is pretty good now. While seeing different sights and just 'hitting my soy sauce'[5]. Actually, his attitude towards life is the most comfortable. If he were truly like your previous boss in Rongcheng, then we'd have to live with our heads tied to our waists[6].\n\nIt's exciting, sure,\n\nbut thinking about now, it's still more comfortable now.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, I'm going up to sleep.\"\n\nOld Daoist drank the last bit of red wine in one gulp. He greeted Xu Qinglang and asked, \"Aren't you going to sleep?\"\n\n\"They say moonlight is good for the skin. I'm sunbathing in the moonlight.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed to the face mask on his face,\n\nas if absorbing the essence of the moon.\n\n\"Tsk, lunatic.\"\n\nOld Daoist yawned and called the monkey, then walked up the stairs. As soon as he reached the second floor, Old Daoist and the monkey both shivered.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nDamn it,\n\nthis damn air conditioning is turned up way too high,\n\nthis cold?\n\nOld Daoist subconsciously wrapped his arms around himself and walked inside. He first went to the boss's bedroom door, because white mist was continuously escaping from the gap under the door.\n\nClearly,\n\nthis was the source.\n\n\"Knock, knock, knock...\"\n\nOld Daoist knocked on the door,\n\n\"Boss, the air conditioner is broken, the power is too strong.\"\n\nThere was no response inside.\n\nOld Daoist couldn't care less about anything else at this point; he could only open the door himself, otherwise, he was genuinely worried he might inadvertently go into hibernation while sleeping at night.\n\nThe door was pushed open, Old Daoist peered his head inside, and then froze.\n\nOn the bed,\n\nthere was a man and a woman.\n\nOf course,\n\nOld Daoist occasionally fantasized in his mind about what might happen between the boss and Bai Yingying every night when they slept. Although he knew Yingying was a zombie and her \"waterway\" was frozen, but as an 'old driver'[7], Old Daoist knew there were many other ways to 'exercise,' and that was where the true romance and fun lay.\n\nThe posture on the bed,\n\nwas very harmonious,\n\nmuch more harmonious than Old Daoist had imagined.\n\nThe boss was lying on Yingying's lap,\n\nYingying was sitting on the bed, her hands on the boss's face.\n\nBoth of them remained motionless even after Old Daoist himself came in, as if they were in a deep sleep and hadn't noticed anyone entering.\n\nWhite mist occasionally rose from the boss's body,\n\nand most of this white mist was inhaled into Bai Yingying's nose.\n\nA small amount dissipated, becoming the culprit causing the nearby temperature to drop.\n\nThis scene,\n\nwas exactly like the scenes Old Daoist used to enjoy in Hong Kong and Taiwan midnight films, where fox spirits or female ghosts absorbed men's yang energy.\n\nOld Daoist hesitated for a moment.\n\nHe didn't know whether to shout, \"Hey, female zombie, let go of my boss!\"\n\nor yell, \"Yo, Yingying, is that comfortable? Don't drain the boss dry!\"\n\nOld Daoist didn't believe Yingying would actively absorb things from the boss's body. He had lived under the same roof with this female zombie for a long time. If the female zombie truly had ulterior motives towards the boss, she wouldn't have needed to risk her life to save him earlier at General Mountain.\n\nTaking a few steps closer, Old Daoist was able to see more clearly.\n\nHe noticed that half of Yingying's originally entirely white hair had turned black.\n\nTsk, tsk,\n\nIs this healing?\n\nThe boss is helping Yingying replenish her vital energy?\n\nOld Daoist thought of the \"Jade Maiden Heart Sutra,\" thinking, \"This martial art is really strange, you even have to lie in bed to practice it.\"\n\nLooking at the boss again,\n\nOld Daoist suddenly noticed the boss's expression was very painful,\n\nas if he was having a nightmare, looking very distressed.\n\nDamn it,\n\nIs this 'qigong deviation'[8]?\n\nOld Daoist gritted his teeth and decided not to care. He immediately picked up a book nearby and poked the boss's chest, but the boss still didn't react.\n\nOld Daoist simply took the book and smacked it onto the boss's chest.\n\n\"Whack!\"\n\nThe sound was loud,\n\nthe boss still didn't wake up, but Bai Yingying suddenly opened her eyes.\n\nThe female zombie's eyes were icy cold, and in an instant, her true nature was revealed. She was originally a zombie, abandoned by heaven, earth, humans, and gods; her usual innocence and playfulness were only reserved for Zhou Ze alone.\n\nAt this moment, she was like someone with 'waking rage,' her gaze swept over Old Daoist.\n\nOld Daoist gasped,\n\nonly feeling the surrounding temperature become even colder.\n\n\"Yingying, it's me, it's this poor Daoist[9]...\"\n\nOld Daoist said, trembling.\n\nBai Yingying remained expressionless.\n\nShe first stared intently at Old Daoist,\n\nthen lowered her head and looked at Zhou Ze in her arms.\n\nAfterwards,\n\nShe also seemed to notice her hair had changed color. She immediately seemed to realize something, quickly got off the bed, and knelt directly beside it.\n\n\"Boss, Yingying didn't mean to. Yingying doesn't know what happened, she just suddenly fell asleep.\n\nYingying truly didn't intentionally absorb the boss's malevolent energy[10], truly didn't mean to.\"\n\nYingying knelt on the ground, her expression incredibly sincere and anxious, like a child who had done something wrong, waiting for an adult's punishment.\n\nUh...\n\nOld Daoist pondered,\n\n\"Should I also kneel to 'fit the scene'[11]?\"\n\nBut it didn't seem to concern him.\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze, whose \"sleep\" state could no longer continue because Bai Yingying had gotten off the bed,\n\nhis body trembled slightly.\n\nAnd then,\n\nhe slowly opened his eyes.\n\nWithin these eyes, there was a maddening bloody color, filled with chilling hysteria.\n\nOh my god!\n\nOld Daoist was so scared his legs instantly turned to jelly, and he knelt down.\n\nThe boss looked too terrifying like this.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat up.\n\nThe images from his dream seemed not to have fully dispersed yet,\n\ngiving him a feeling of \"Is life but a dream, or is the dream life itself?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't initially look at Old Daoist and Bai Yingying kneeling on the ground,\n\nbut instead closed his eyes.\n\nAfter a while, when he opened them again,\n\nthe blood red in Zhou Ze's eyes slowly faded, transforming into clarity.\n\nThat dream,\n\nended at its most crucial and desperate moment.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit disappointed, but also a little relieved.\n\nHe turned his face and looked at Bai Yingying, who was still kneeling on the ground, noticing the change in Bai Yingying's hair color, and asked:\n\n\"I remember saying that once my body recovers, I'll help you restore yourself.\"\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nBai Yingying saw that Zhou Ze had misunderstood her, thinking she had actively and intentionally absorbed the malevolent energy from his body, and immediately bowed her head even lower, explaining:\n\n\"Boss, when Yingying was massaging you,\n\nthe malevolent energy from your body dissipated on its own.\n\nYingying got dizzy after taking a few breaths, and then she forgot what happened next.\"\n\nOld Daoist then spoke up to help Yingying clear her name:\n\n\"That's right, Boss, you can't blame Yingying for this.\n\nIt was you who 'overflowed from fullness'[12],\n\nNocturnal emission—\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nOld Daoist bit his lip,\n\nlowered his head,\n\nand slapped himself.\n\nMy,\n\nsmelly mouth...\n***\n[1] \"鹹魚\" (xiányú): Literally \"salted fish,\" an idiom referring to a state of lethargy, unmotivation, or \"lying flat.\"\n[2] \"緊箍\" (jǐnggū): The magical golden fillet worn by Sun Wukong (the Monkey King) in *Journey to the West*, which could be tightened by a magic spell.\n[3] \"某寶\" (mǒu Bǎo): Literally \"Certain Treasure,\" a stand-in for Taobao.com, a major online shopping platform in China.\n[4] \"半桶水\" (bàntǒngshuǐ): Literally \"half a bucket of water,\" an idiom for someone who has superficial knowledge or skills, a dabbler.\n[5] \"打醬油\" (dǎ jiàngyóu): Literally \"buying soy sauce,\" an internet slang term implying being a bystander, not involved, or just going about one's own business.\n[6] \"腦袋系在腰上\" (nǎodài xì zài yāoshang): An idiom meaning to live a dangerous or risky life, putting one's life on the line.\n[7] \"老司機\" (lǎosījī): Literally \"old driver,\" an internet slang term referring to someone experienced in a particular field, often with implied \"inside knowledge\" or \"saucy\" understanding.

    "content": "After taking a shower, Zhou Ze changed his clothes and sat on the sofa downstairs. It was still the middle of the night, with a long time until dawn, but Zhou Ze had lost all desire to sleep.\n\nAfter having that dream, it would be difficult for any normal person to fall back asleep quickly.\n\nBai Yingying brewed coffee for Zhou Ze and brought it to him, then stood beside him, fidgeting like a child who had done something wrong.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, signaling that it was fine and she could go up to rest or play games. But Bai Yingying was still unwilling to leave. In her opinion, whether intentionally or not, she had indeed absorbed baleful aura from Zhou Ze, and her boss's body clearly hadn't fully recovered yet.\n\nIt was like someone with a serious illness still carousing every night. Truly courting death.\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of coffee, lit a cigarette, and honestly, he was also a bit puzzled why baleful aura would spontaneously emanate from him while he was dreaming. He believed Bai Yingying wasn't deliberately harming him or being impatient; in fact, Bai Yingying was quite pleased with her \"White-Haired Witch\" look, and lately, her dressing style had even embraced ancient aesthetics, which had a unique charm.\n\nThis matter was just a thorn in his side. If he couldn't figure it out, he could only put it aside for now. After all, there were more important things to deal with and resolve at the moment.\n\nHalf an hour later, a police car pulled up in front of the bookstore.\n\nMadam Xu, who was still \"absorbing the essence of the sun and moon\" nearby, saw the police arrive, immediately got up and went upstairs, unwilling to stay downstairs.\n\nHe had complained that the air and sleep in the detention center were bad, and that night in the detention center had been a great blow to his skin.\n\nZhang Yanfeng entered. Zhou Ze had sent him a message.\n\nZhang Yanfeng held a document bag in his hand. His gaze first landed on Bai Yingying, and he asked, somewhat puzzled:\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\nThe last time the police entered the bookstore, Zhou Ze had told Bai Yingying and the others to leave first, so Zhang Yanfeng didn't know Bai Yingying. And even if the police's information system was powerful, it couldn't possibly have Bai Yingying's information.\n\n\"My niece.\"\n\nZhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\nZhang Yanfeng didn't dwell on it anymore and sat down opposite Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Coffee or tea?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nZhang Yanfeng ran a hand over his somewhat weary face, then smelled the rich aroma of the coffee in front of Zhou Ze, and said, \"Coffee, please.\"\n\nBai Yingying went to make coffee. Zhou Ze turned his head and called out:\n\n\"Get the instant Nescafé.\"\n\n\"...............\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThe coffee was brought over. Zhang Yanfeng was quite straightforward, drinking it all in one gulp, then pointed at the document bag on the table and said, \"Don't you want to take a look?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"There probably isn't any useful information.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng chuckled, lit a cigarette, and asked:\n\n\"Why did you call me here?\"\n\n\"Because I just slept.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Then, I had a dream.\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched.\n\nThe scenes in the dream were unbearable to recall.\n\nOf course, compared to the sealed space he finally entered, even the previous experience from the \"cross-dressing pregnant woman's perspective\" was insignificant.\n\n\"What kind of dream?\" Zhang Yanfeng's expression turned serious.\n\nIn this world,\n\nOnly he and Zhou Ze had chains tied to their legs. Since he could dream, Zhou Ze naturally could too.\n\n\"That place shouldn't be a hospital.\" Zhou Ze coughed and continued, \"It should have been a secret underground concentration camp, somewhat like the Nazi Auschwitz.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng's eyes narrowed. \"Concentration camp?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dream should have overlapped with yours. I also dreamed of that prison;\n\nBut perhaps because I have different reasons than you, my dream was more real and had far more details than yours.\n\nThere were many prisoners held there, and every cell was overcrowded.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the invisible iron chain on his leg and continued:\n\n\"This chain was something thrown out by the prison management. It doesn't seem to symbolize bondage; at least, to the prisoners, it seemed to represent something beautiful, carrying different beautiful emotions.\"\n\nZhou Ze then recalled the man in his dream who helped the woman snatch the iron chain.\n\nWhen the woman walked out wearing the iron chain,\n\nhe stood behind the iron bars, his eyes filled with blessings and beautiful anticipation.\n\nBut he probably didn't know,\n\nthat the woman wearing the chain,\n\nultimately walked into what kind of place.\n\nThis formed an extremely strong contradiction, as Zhou Ze felt that his analysis of the final environment in his dream couldn't have been wrong at the time.\n\nInformation about Nazi Auschwitz is truly not hard to find. Many people associated with it have written similar memoirs. Zhou Ze had read one passage during his school days that was deeply etched in his memory: many Jews, upon entering that room, thought it was a place for them to shower, but instead of warm water, poison gas came out of the small holes.\n\nZhang Yanfeng remained silent, unsure how to respond.\n\n\"I suppose this information isn't mentioned in this document, is it?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the document bag on the coffee table.\n\nZhang Yanfeng shook his head.\n\n\"That prison should be deep underground,\" Zhou Ze said in a low voice. \"And speculating from the clothing people wore at the time, and the uniforms of the administrators I saw, it should have been during the Republican era. Since there's no record of it in this information, I wonder if there's a possibility that this prison is still underground, completely undiscovered?\"\n\n\"So, what's your point? You want me to apply to my superiors to demolish the police station and start digging downwards?\n\nOn the grounds that I had a dream?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng retorted.\n\n\"There's always a way, isn't there?\" Zhou Ze took another sip of coffee. \"After all, the aggrieved parties have already found their way to our feet.\"\n\n\"I can't do it, and it's impossible to do it with that kind of reason,\" Zhang Yanfeng said seriously.\n\n\"Actually, it's not difficult. We just need to find a tiny bit of evidence,\" Zhou Ze analyzed.\n\n\"Recently, the police station has been preparing to level out an area for an underground parking garage,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"I understand.\" Zhou Ze nodded, indicating he got it. But Boss Zhou lazily continued, \"I'll have someone work on it.\"\n\nIf they could use this opportunity to have the construction team dig a bit deeper, perhaps some clues would appear. Once it's confirmed that there might be special structures underground, then normal excavation and construction could proceed legitimately.\n\n\"Anything else?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked, seemingly intending to leave.\n\n\"You can't help with my matters.\"\n\nZhou Ze chuckled, for example, why his \"essence overflowed on its own\" during dreaming<sup>1</sup>, and why the emanating baleful aura was so potent it could make Bai Yingying fall into a stupor.\n\n\"Then I'll be going,\" Zhang Yanfeng stood up and picked up the document bag from the coffee table.\n\n\"Oh, Captain Zhang,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhang Yanfeng turned his head to look at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Did your ancestors have anyone who served in the military?\" Zhou Ze tried his best to phrase his words carefully. \"Your grandfather's or great-grandfather's generation?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Just asking. Perhaps some of the victims there might be your relatives. You know, blood relations can very well form a kind of bond;\n\nAnd sometimes, this bond can even transcend the distance between life and death.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of the old man he had killed near the Confucius Temple back then. The old man had served the Confucius Temple for many years, all to pray for blessings for his descendants.\n\n\"I don't know about that. I'll have to ask.\"\n\n\"Including those who went missing under unusual circumstances,\" Zhou Ze added.\n\n\"You said there might be my elder in that prison, but if it's my elder, why would they put a chain on me, their descendant?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"But for them, the chain is a symbol of something beautiful. What if your elder liked you and put this on you?\n\nLike giving you a piece of candy or a longevity lock.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng was silent for a moment, then still left.\n\nZhou Ze propped his feet up and continued to lie sideways on the sofa, falling into another kind of contemplation.\n\nThat is, if Zhang Yanfeng could say that perhaps one of his relatives or elders died in that prison, and so the chain eventually ended up on him,\n\nthen what about himself?\n\nWas it merely because he was a ghost constable,\n\nand he happened to be within the police station's area,\n\nthat he was then shackled?\n\nReally,\n\nwas that it?\n\nAs he pondered, Zhou Ze suddenly felt a tightness in his chest. He stood up, pushed open the bookstore door, walked out, and stood on the late-night street.\n\nThe air was filled with a faint dampness, and sparse raindrops were falling.\n\nOh,\n\nso it was going to rain,\n\nno wonder it felt so stuffy.\n\nZhou Ze continued to stand in the rain, lighting another cigarette.\n\nThe rain began to fall harder,\n\ntransforming from a drizzle into a torrential downpour.\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand to shield his head,\n\nhaving just showered, he decided to head back inside the bookstore first.\n\nHowever,\n\nas he lifted his foot, he stumbled, almost falling down.\n\nHis leg felt so heavy,\n\nas if something was shackling it, making it impossible to lift.\n\nZhou Ze looked down in surprise,\n\nand discovered that on his leg,\n\nthere was actually an ankle chain,\n\nHow,\n\nhow could this be?\n\n..................\n\nThe Old Taoist sniffed, then walked downstairs. He had just slept for a bit, but felt a bit chilled, so he came down to pour a cup of hot water to warm himself up. It was truly because the boss and the others had made the second floor too \"cool,\" and the cooling effect hadn't completely dissipated yet.\n\nEarlier, he had even heard Xu Qinglang sneeze while going upstairs, apparently also finding the lingering effects of this natural, man-made cooling a bit unbearable.\n\n\"Yo.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist slowly sipped his hot water while looking at Bai Yingying, who was sitting on the sofa.\n\n\"The boss fell asleep again?\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded, gently stroking the boss's face, and said:\n\n\"He fell asleep right after that police officer left. The boss must be truly exhausted.\"\n\n\"Heh heh heh, how could he not be tired? You've practically drained him dry!\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> This idiom literally means \"essence overflowing on its own,\" often refers to male seminal discharge. Here, it's used humorously and metaphorically to describe the malevolent aura (煞气) emanating from Zhou Ze due to its abundance.",

"雨一直下，\n\n\n\n  氣氛不算融洽，\n\n\n\n  周澤默默地發現自己所站的街道正在慢慢地縮小，腳下的地面也在變得模糊，\n\n\n\n  視線所及之處，正在不斷地被壓縮著，\n\n\n\n  逐漸形成了夢靨的翻版，\n\n\n\n  哦不，\n\n\n\n  其實，不能說是翻版吧，只能說是，\n\n\n\n  一種延續。\n\n\n\n  回過頭，\n\n\n\n  發現身後不再是書店，而是一扇緊閉的鐵門。\n\n\n\n  再往上看，雨簾不見，取而代之的，是牆壁密密麻麻細孔位置不斷滴落下來的不知名液體。\n\n\n\n  又是那個夢？\n\n\n\n  自己又回到夢裡了？\n\n\n\n  回到了上次結束的地方，\n\n\n\n  回到了噩夢的暫停位置，\n\n\n\n  而當那個按鈕按下去之後，\n\n\n\n  似乎只是給了你一點點的中場休息時間，\n\n\n\n  接下來你該承受的，\n\n\n\n  你該體驗的，\n\n\n\n  你該去面對的，\n\n\n\n  根本就跑不掉。\n\n\n\n  周澤不清楚這是為什麼，這個夢，這個鎖鏈，為什麼會有著這麼大的能力。 \n\n\n\n  想當初自己進入三鄉村時，靠著那枚青銅戒指的「運營」，三鄉村得以成為一個獨特的架構一直存在至今，但也不至於有主動將人「吸入」的能力。\n\n\n\n  三鄉村也只能靜靜地存在於那個位置，還需要你費盡心思去找它，才能進入，根本不會像這個夢一樣，張開嘴主動地把你吞噬進去。\n\n\n\n  夢的結束，\n\n\n\n  夢的開始，\n\n\n\n  這其中，帶著極為明顯地蠻不講理，似乎周澤這個做夢的主體在這其中根本就無足輕重。\n\n\n\n  無論周澤是否願意，\n\n\n\n  他都會進來，\n\n\n\n  且必須進來。\n\n\n\n  周澤深吸一口氣，\n\n\n\n  講真，\n\n\n\n  一向鹹魚心態的周老闆最不喜歡的，就是這種感覺，他喜歡無拘無束，浪費屬於自己的青春和人生，但並不願意有人來對自己的生活指手畫腳，甚至強制自己去做一些事情。\n\n\n\n  也因此，\n\n\n\n  周老闆在此時選擇了非暴力不合作，\n\n\n\n  稀里糊塗地再入夢中，\n\n\n\n  好吧，\n\n\n\n  既然如此，\n\n\n\n  那自己就當一個冷靜的旁觀者。 \n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  甚至攤開雙臂，\n\n\n\n  周澤做出了主動迎接的架勢。\n\n\n\n  壓抑逼仄的空間裡，\n\n\n\n  那些液體不斷地澆灌在周澤的身上，\n\n\n\n  略微有些粘稠，且鼻尖不斷湧入類似於消毒水一樣的味道。\n\n\n\n  不過，周澤本來腦補的一些東西並沒有出現。\n\n\n\n  比如皮膚龜裂或者起密密麻麻的水泡或者肉體腐爛露出白骨云云，這些都沒有出現。\n\n\n\n  當然，\n\n\n\n  這種感覺也不好受，有點類似於泡在福馬林中的標本。\n\n\n\n  面前，是一塊白色的布簾，裹得嚴嚴實實。\n\n\n\n  周澤走過去，伸手去將其撕開一個口子，然後用力地掰開。\n\n\n\n  前面，\n\n\n\n  是和自己身後一樣的空間，\n\n\n\n  但又一個大肚子的女人正扶著牆壁不停地乾嘔著，顯得很是痛苦。\n\n\n\n  她的身子應該本就很虛弱，而此時這個空間裡這麼濃郁的刺激性味道，也著實讓她很是難受。\n\n\n\n  又是孕婦？\n\n\n\n  這裡的孕婦怎麼就這麼多？\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地低下頭， \n\n\n\n  然後有些愕然，\n\n\n\n  自己的肚子是乾癟著的，\n\n\n\n  嗯？\n\n\n\n  好像有些不對勁。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手摸向了老道經常掏出符紙的位置，\n\n\n\n  一桿槍加倆子彈袋，\n\n\n\n  這是一具男人的身體！\n\n\n\n  這次重新進入夢中，換了主視角了麼？\n\n\n\n  還有，\n\n\n\n  自己面前的這個女人，\n\n\n\n  怪不得這麼眼熟，\n\n\n\n  原來就是自己上次做夢時的主視角。\n\n\n\n  周澤走了過去，想要把女人攙扶起來。\n\n\n\n  算是一種本能的，哪怕他知道這是一個夢，但自己至少曾陪伴過這個女人。\n\n\n\n  也就在此時，原本周澤身後的鐵門被推開了，發出了刺耳的摩擦聲，而後有好幾名穿著防化服的人員走了進來，他們的雨靴踩在地上發出了「吧唧吧唧」的聲響。\n\n\n\n  其中兩個人直接伸手夾住了周澤的肩膀，把周澤往後拖拽。\n\n\n\n  他們的力氣其實不算很大，但周澤雖然這次夢裡從女人的視角換回到了男人的視角，但不變的是身體依舊極為虛弱。\n\n\n\n  就算是再強壯的人，被羈押在這個地方，每天吃著跟泔水差不多的食物，不見天日，估計也很快就會廢了吧。 \n\n\n\n  那個孕婦也一樣被夾了起來，兩個人一起被架著往外走。\n\n\n\n  周澤嘗試不停地扭頭看著四周，一直到周圍的過道開始越來越寬，到最後，遠處還聽到了陣陣聲響。\n\n\n\n  不是牢房裡的聲音，\n\n\n\n  事實上周澤待過牢房，牢房那裡雖然關著很多很多的人，但是那裡格外的安靜，大家都沒氣力了，也不會有人傻乎乎地抓著欄杆喊著什麼「放我出去，求求你放我出去」這類的廢話。\n\n\n\n  上頭的燈管開始越來越亮，也越來越密。\n\n\n\n  周澤被抬起來，放到了一輛擔架車上，然後自己的手腕和腳腕位置被重新做了一次固定。\n\n\n\n  周澤聽老道以前說過，一些帶著S。。。。M主題的情侶房會有這種項目，人會被「大」字型捆綁在床上，用以增加情趣。\n\n\n\n  擔架車被繼續往前推，周澤側過頭，看見自己身邊還有一輛擔架車，上面躺著那個孕婦。\n\n\n\n  比起周澤的淡然，孕婦就顯得緊張得多了，不停地哭喊著什麼，顯然，她發現了不對勁。\n\n\n\n  她的丈夫，姑且認為那個給她餵飯的男人是她的丈夫吧，拼得頭破血流給她爭奪到了鐵鏈，肯定不是為了享受此時的這一刻的。\n\n\n\n  周澤一直覺得，牢房裡的所有人，對這腳鏈，帶著一種極大的誤解，當然，這也是監獄管理方故意造成的誤解，甚至有意在經營著這種謊言。 \n\n\n\n  女人的喊叫聲很雜亂，不是通城方言，應該是其他地方的方言，所以她到底在喊一些什麼說一些什麼，周澤用力去聽了，但收穫寥寥，基本上都聽不懂。\n\n\n\n  最終，\n\n\n\n  兩個擔架車被推到了一個房間裡，這裡有著一些手術器械和設備。\n\n\n\n  對於曾經當過醫生的周澤來說，這裡的手術設備和器械實在是老舊得不能再老舊，一些東西自己以前只是在課本上看到過。\n\n\n\n  穿著防化服的人把兩個擔架車上的人又檢查了一遍，然後一起離開，走了出去，很快，又有一群穿著白大褂的人走了進來。\n\n\n\n  周澤一直在看著他們，他在期待著這些白大褂說話，因為在周澤的心裡，一直有一個猜測，而這個猜測，需要一個佐證。\n\n\n\n  只要這幫人說話，\n\n\n\n  就能確定自己的猜測到底對不對了。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  他們並沒有說話。\n\n\n\n  這群白大褂自走入這個房間開始，就毫無交流。\n\n\n\n  雖然周澤可以看出他們面罩之下的年輕和老邁，甚至有兩個頭髮都有些花白了，也能看得出他們之間有身份地位的差距，明顯的副手和主刀。\n\n\n\n  但他們就是不說話，不做任何的交流。 \n\n\n\n  或許，這種事情，對於他們來說有點像是日常了。\n\n\n\n  實驗室里送進來兩個標本活體，\n\n\n\n  他們照例去應對，\n\n\n\n  就像是廚師每天上班打卡，不需要研究新的菜式，每天做的菜也是固定的，鹽味精油等等調料，都有標配，一切的一切，按部就班就可以。\n\n\n\n  其中兩個年輕的白大褂走到了屋子最裡面的一個類似保險柜的位置，那裡有一根金屬管子從裡頭探出來，兩個白大褂像是打開水龍頭一樣，從裡頭抽出了一團赤紅色的東西。\n\n\n\n  這是，\n\n\n\n  血？\n\n\n\n  這大保險柜里，是血庫？\n\n\n\n  接下來，拿著血樣的年輕白大褂站在一邊，伸手指了指周澤和隔壁床鋪的孕婦。\n\n\n\n  意思是，\n\n\n\n  先來哪個？\n\n\n\n  一個年紀稍大的白大褂走到了孕婦旁邊，示意先這個。\n\n\n\n  沒有交流，\n\n\n\n  依舊沒有交流。\n\n\n\n  這是夢，周澤不斷地對自己說著，既然是夢，那必然是假的，哪怕以前發生過，但也絕對不是發生在此時此刻自己的眼前。\n\n\n\n  周澤原以為自己能夠很是平靜地看完這一切，

    "content": "A \"Yōxi\"* already explained everything.\n\nIn his past life, as a doctor, Zhou Ze clearly understood that the development of new drugs and the advancement of medicine were inseparable from human experimentation of this kind. The most classic example, \"Shennong Tastes the Hundred Herbs,\" could be considered the progenitor of human experimentation. However, in that case, he experimented on his own body, which is why it appeared great and noble.\n\nModern medicine, on the other hand, had already formed a relatively complete and mature system. The development of new drugs also had its own norms and procedures. Preliminary measurements, mid-stage animal experiments, and subsequent Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III clinical trials—the potential harms, such as side effects that drugs might cause and other theoretically possible dangers, were often compressed to within a controllable and acceptable range.\n\nHumanity tirelessly placed restrictions and shackles on its own progress. Perhaps in the eyes of some mad scientists, this was a self-imposed constraint, but in reality, it was humanity's instinct for self-preservation.\n\nNo matter the development of any discipline, its ultimate goal was to ultimately benefit humanity, rather than to inflict harm upon itself.\n\nIn his past life, a medical professor from Japan had visited China for an industry exchange lecture. He would always mention his teacher; whenever he spoke of major directions or policies, he would invariably bring up his teacher as corroboration. When his teacher was alive, he was the Mount Tai and Big Dipper** of Japanese surgical medicine.\n\nUpholding the idea that medicine knows no borders, Zhou Ze listened to the entire lecture. He went back and did some searching and consulted with people in the industry, only then to discover that the master of that venerable figure had once participated in human experimentation research projects during the Sino-Japanese War period.\n\nBecause of special reasons,\n\nSuch people were not sent to the trial stand or the gallows. On the contrary, after returning to their home country, they often became professors or even deans in some major local hospitals in Japan, and even academic overlords*** in certain fields of the global medical community.\n\nThis was indeed a very dark irony.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nA group of white coats**** surrounded a lifted infant, applauding ceaselessly.\n\nBut not long after,\n\nThe infant, whose entire body was black, and who had been crudely dissected directly from its deceased mother, also stopped moving.\n\nThe middle-aged white coat put the infant down, then began dissecting it. The other white coats around them also prepared for recording.\n\nAfter the initial dissection was completed, they seemed satisfied. They were very pleased with today's research breakthrough, and it appeared they intended to continue with this specimen's subject.\n\nOne of the young white coats pointed at Zhou Ze,\n\nas if asking how to handle the other specimen here.\n\nThe middle-aged white coat responded with a string of Japanese. Zhou Ze didn't understand it, but he could sense from his tone that the other party meant to just assign him any random project. The impression was that there was ample supply, and since they already had enough data and discoveries for the day, he could just mess around as he pleased.\n\nSubsequently, one white coat remained there, while the others excitedly left with the infant's corpse specimen.\n\nThis young white coat seemed eager, like a child who used to only watch adults play games, but could now finally operate it himself. It was an indescribable thrill.\n\n\"Maruta*****... hey...\"\n\nThe young white coat mumbled a string of Japanese to himself. Zhou Ze still didn't understand it, but there was one word he did understand.\n\n\"Maruta,\" in Japanese, means \"log\" or \"timber.\" It could roughly be understood as a very common material. From this designation, one could discern the attitude of these Japanese towards the live specimens before them, locked in the dungeon and readily available for use.\n\nZhou Ze lay with his eyes half-open. He no longer had the initial urge to constantly think about ending this dream. Since he would wake up after leaving this dream, or unconsciously re-enter it if someone outside woke him up and interrupted it, instead of savoring the nightmare slowly, segment by segment, like a Western meal, he might as well be straightforward****** and devour it in one gulp.\n\nMoreover, regarding this strange dream, Zhou Ze felt increasingly perplexed. Inexplicably, it felt as if something was continuously pulling him.\n\nThe infant, which the Japanese carried away, should have later turned into a vengeful spirit. After all, in the previous dream, Zhou Ze had seen this infant crawl out of \"his own\" belly and then crawl back in.\n\nPerhaps, the formation of this dream had a significant connection with the infant's deceased soul.\n\nWhile Zhou Ze's thoughts wandered, the white coat injected something into Zhou Ze with a syringe.\n\nAs soon as the substance was injected into his body, Zhou Ze felt a burning pain in his left arm, where it had been injected. Subsequently, this pain began to spread throughout his entire body with his blood circulation.\n\nZhou Ze thought of the pregnant woman; she had ultimately been tormented to death on the stretcher bed. Would he also have to follow her path?\n\nBut the young white coat directly unlocked Zhou Ze's restraints, keeping only the ankle chains on his feet. Then, he used a rope to bind Zhou Ze's wrists behind his back, and immediately after, took out a metal collar from nearby and placed it around Zhou Ze's neck.\n\nZhou Ze had seen this device before. Mental hospitals liked to use it when apprehending psychiatric patients, and some local police forces had it in their riot gear. It was a large clamp that could basically subdue a suspect once it latched onto their neck.\n\nDue to the unbearable pain, Zhou Ze rolled over and fell off the stretcher bed. The white coat held the handle with one hand, controlling Zhou Ze, while holding a pen and looking at his watch with the other, as if recording some data.\n\nAches, pains, muscle spasms, and twitching – Zhou Ze had thought he would have to re-experience that suffering. But for some reason, slowly, these pains began to recede from him.\n\nHe was still in this first-person perspective, still in this body. He could perceive the immense torment this body was currently enduring, but he seemed somewhat numb, as if detached.\n\nThe body began to instinctively crawl outward. Zhou Ze watched on like an observer, using this perspective. It felt like watching a documentary with VR glasses on.\n\nPerhaps, this was a blessing in disguise.******* Perhaps, the dream believed that if it transmitted this pain equivalently to his senses, it might trigger his real-life body's reactions, and then the dream would be forcibly cut off.\n\nConsidering the recent tragic death of that pregnant woman, Zhou Ze even felt that if similar torment befell him, his real-life self might instinctively enter a \"zombie\" state.\n\nThe young white coat seemed to let his \"Maruta\" begin to crawl outward, like walking a dog, appearing very relaxed and at ease.\n\nAfter crawling out of the laboratory, he continued to crawl in the corridor.\n\nZhou Ze saw the conditions in other laboratories, and even in the corridor, other white coats passed by, but they all found it nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nPassing by one laboratory, Zhou Ze saw two men lying on two stretcher beds inside. Each man had one arm recently severed, and several white coats were busy attempting limb reattachment for them.\n\nFor modern medicine, this was an extremely ridiculous procedure and experiment, even something out of a wild fantasy.\n\nBut here,\n\nit was being carried out in earnest.\n\nThis type of research project was for the benefit of the Imperial Army******** soldiers who were wounded and disabled on the battlefield. They believed that if limbs could be replaced, it would enhance the fighting capability of the Imperial Army.\n\nIt was unclear if the young white coat was doing it intentionally, perhaps needing to record some data. Perhaps the liquid he injected into this live subject was less than what the pregnant woman received before, so this live subject could continue crawling for a longer time, and didn't die quickly. Of course, the duration of this agonizing torment also increased exponentially.\n\nZhou Ze also saw a laboratory where five women lay. Their commonality was that their bellies had been cut open. All five were dead, and it was likely they were all pregnant women, with their unborn infants already removed from their wombs.\n\nIt was hard to imagine,\n\nthat within this not-so-large space,\n\nevery laboratory,\n\nwas witnessing utterly inhumane tragedies unfold.\n\nThere was a horror movie called 'The Cabin in the Woods,'\n\nbut the scenes in 'The Cabin in the Woods' couldn't compare to even a tenth or two of what was here.\n\n\"Crash!\"\n\nThe door crashed open,\n\nSeveral white coats inside looked over, expressions of displeasure on their faces. The young white coat immediately apologized, then pulled Zhou Ze out.\n\nZhou Ze only saw that in this laboratory,\n\nfive people were kneeling, their hands placed in a place similar to a large refrigerator. There were small holes there, only large enough for a person's hands to be inserted.\n\nOne of them was pulled out. His hands had long since been frozen white, and then he was escorted by two white coats who forced his hands into boiling water.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nthe flesh seemed to melt away like ice cream,\n\nleaving only a pair of white bones.\n\nAnd the man just numbly watched it all; he could no longer feel any pain.\n\nThe young white coat seemed somewhat surprised, surprised by the terrifying vitality of this live specimen, as if it had broken some record. He yelled at a passing colleague nearby, seemingly to inform his superior, then pulled Zhou Ze back to the initial laboratory.\n\nHe closed the laboratory door, then walked back to the front of the huge safe, as if to extract more blood samples again.\n\nThe body's twitching seemed to have stopped, as if it had overcome the initial spasms and rejection phase. It simply sat there against the wall, eyes vacant.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's gaze,\n\nwas fixed on the huge safe in front of him.\n\nAfter the previous round of \"crawling,\" Zhou Ze discovered that this laboratory seemed to be the core of this underground research facility.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't too surprised that there was such a research facility in Tongcheng. Most people were only familiar with Unit 731, located in Harbin.\n\nIn fact, there were also the Kwantung Army Unit 100 in Changchun, North China 1855 Unit in Beijing, Rong 1644 Unit in Nanjing, Bo 8604 Unit in Guangzhou, and so on. These were just the cities where the main headquarters were located. Each headquarters had many branch offices, similarly conducting human experimentation research in large, medium, and small cities in nearby provinces.\n\nThe young white coat took a large syringe and extracted blood from a metal tube,\n\nthen walked back to Zhou Ze,\n\nlooking at Zhou Ze with curiosity and surprise. He grabbed Zhou Ze's arm with one hand, preparing to inject more.\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head,\n\nlooking at the very young face before him.\n\nIt was strange,\n\nand ironic.\n\nA young person of this age, if placed in most hospitals today, would probably only be an intern grunt,********* and might not even be as old as the interns Zhou Ze used to boss around.\n\nYet in this era, he was doing such things, and with the mindset of a child entering an amusement park.\n\n\"Baka!\"**********\n\nThe young white coat saw that Zhou Ze actually dared to glare at him,\n\nand directly slapped Zhou Ze across the face,\n\nPerhaps,\n\nhe had sensed the contempt in the depths of Zhou Ze's gaze, which made him very uncomfortable.\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze felt nothing from this slap. He had long lost all feeling; other than seeing, he could not experience pain.\n\nHowever, because of this slap,\n\nthe look of mockery in Zhou Ze's eyes became even clearer.\n\nThe young white coat raised his hand again, preparing to deliver another slap. But before his palm could land,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA muffled sound,\n\ncame from inside the huge safe,\n\nas if something inside had violently crashed into the safe.\n\nZhou Ze saw the young white coat in front of him, his hand trembling,\n\nand an expression of terror appeared on his face.\n\nHe turned his head,\n\nand looked at the huge safe behind him...\n\n---\n*   *Yōxi*: Japanese for \"Good!\" or \"Alright!\", often used to express satisfaction or approval.\n**  *Mount Tai and Big Dipper*: A Chinese idiom referring to a person of great authority or influence in a particular field.\n*** *Academic overlords*: A term referring to an influential figure in academia who holds significant power and control, often implying a degree of authoritarianism or monopolization.\n**** *White coats*: A common colloquial term for doctors or medical personnel, often used in a slightly detached or critical context.\n***** *Maruta*: Literally meaning \"log\" or \"timber,\" this term was used by Imperial Japanese Army Unit 731 to refer to human test subjects, dehumanizing them as disposable raw materials for experimentation.\n****** *Straightforward*: Literally \"to be a bare stick,\" meaning to be frank, direct, or straightforward, often implying no reservations or hesitation.\n******* *Blessing in disguise*: Literally \"great fortune within misfortune,\" meaning a blessing in disguise or a silver lining.\n******** *Imperial Army*: Refers to the Imperial Japanese Army.\n********* *Intern grunt*: Literally \"intern dog,\" a colloquial and somewhat demeaning term for a low-ranking or overworked intern.\n********** *Baka*: Japanese for \"idiot\" or \"fool,\" a common insult.",

    "content": "A Cadillac stopped in front of the bookstore. It was still early morning, so South Street, which was bustling during the day, was still deserted.\n\nA woman got out of the car, wearing a lily-print dress and black stockings. Her pristine, delicate skin and youthful face perfectly embodied the harmonious unity of youth and sex appeal.\n\nLicking her lips, the woman wasn't in a hurry to enter. Instead, she looked at the archways on either side of the bookstore: on one side was \"Just Listen to It,\" and on the other, \"Thus Have I Heard.\"\n\n\"I'll just casually tell some hearsay stories, and you can just casually listen. Don't take it seriously, and don't take it to heart.\"\n\nA slacker-like aura wafted over.\n\nIf it were someone of princely or general rank, hanging this at their doorstep after retirement would give one a sense of having seen the world's vicissitudes and returning to true simplicity.\n\nBut the woman knew that the bookstore's boss inherently possessed a slacker disposition; to put it bluntly, he was a bit unambitious, always thinking of just getting by.\n\nIt's like if an ordinary person sees a hundred-dollar bill on the ground and deliberately pretends not to see it and doesn't pick it up, they'd be seen as a prime example of putting on a false front*. But if Bill Gates didn't pick it up, it could often lead to many profound life lessons.\n\nWalking to the storefront, the door was locked. For a bookstore that usually only officially opened for business late at night, the fact that its door was locked at this hour already implied something unusual.\n\nThe woman's finger moved slightly,\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nThe lock inside opened by itself.\n\nShe pushed the door open,\n\nAnd walked in.\n\nThe woman closed her eyes, revealing an expression of extreme enjoyment.\n\nOne should know,\n\nAt this moment, many parts of the bookstore were covered in frost, especially near the ground, with white mist swirling around, like the mist surrounding the edges of popsicles in summer, not the effect of dry ice.\n\nAt first, it was comfortable, but slowly, even the woman found it unbearable. She looked at the motionless man and woman on the sofa and chose to retreat outside.\n\nThen she took out her phone and dialed a number.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe old Taoist priest, wrapped in a military cotton overcoat, ran down from upstairs, shivering and sniffling. Especially as he passed his boss, he clearly felt that *that part of him* had frozen and shrunk into a hard walnut.\n\nThe old Taoist priest didn't dare delay. He immediately ran out of the store and took off his military overcoat.\n\nSummer nights were muggy, and now the old Taoist priest was really enjoying this mugginess, wishing it were even hotter.\n\nLooking left and right, the old Taoist priest saw the Cadillac. He approached it and saw the woman leaning against the car door, holding her phone.\n\nThe woman was very young, perhaps just a little older than Bai Yingying from the bookstore.\n\n\"Oh, you've arrived!\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest immediately put on a fawning expression, and of course, there was also the joy of seeing an old acquaintance again.\n\nThe person who came was none other than Tang Shi.\n\nTang Shi looked at the old Taoist priest, whose nose was red from the cold, and smiled slightly, saying:\n\n\"Someone saw your current boss on the Yellow Springs in a dream, so he told me to come and see. It seems the problem is quite serious.\"\n\n\"Uh, how's the boss?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\nTang Shi sighed, pointed to her own eyes, and remained silent.\n\nThe old Taoist priest also sighed, not asking further. He then looked back at the bookstore behind him and said, \"Should I go wake him up?\"\n\n\"Waking him up wouldn't help. This matter isn't that simple; it might cause trouble. First, tell me what exactly happened. He didn't explain clearly when he came out, only told me to come and take a look.\"\n\n\"Alright, how about we go inside for a cup of tea, we can...\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old Taoist priest looked back at the \"Frozen\"-themed bookstore behind him,\n\nThen shook his head, saying:\n\n\"Never mind, let's just sit on the curb and talk.\"\n\n---\n\nWhen dawn broke, the rumble of machinery could already be heard behind the police station. A newly approved plot of land was being converted into an underground parking lot, and because of the tight schedule, the construction team had started work early in the morning.\n\nZhang Yanfeng had just woken up, yawning. Usually busy with work, sleeping in the office was a common occurrence for him.\n\nAfter returning from the bookstore last night, he sat in his office chain-smoking, then unconsciously fell asleep slumped over his desk.\n\nHe had a dream.\n\nHe dreamt that he and Zhou Ze were sitting face to face on a park bench. He had forgotten what they were talking about, only remembering that he saw a rusty chain on his leg and on Zhou Ze's leg.\n\nThe first thing he did after waking up was to wash up. After brushing his teeth and washing his face, Zhang Yanfeng felt his mind finally clearer.\n\nHe had just picked up his toiletries, ready to return to the office and start his day's work, when two young police officers walked towards him, excitedly discussing something. They collided with Zhang Yanfeng at the corner.\n\n\"What are you two discussing so intently?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng wasn't angry. A divorced middle-aged man accustomed to sleeping in the office wouldn't have any airs.\n\n\"Captain Zhang, sorry about that. We were talking about what the construction team just dug up behind us, like memorial tablets and some pottery,\" a young police officer replied.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately handed the items in his hands to the young police officer next to him, then rushed down the office building and ran towards the construction area behind.\n\nHe hadn't expected Zhou Ze to be so quick. He had only told him about the construction team last night, and this morning Zhou Ze was already able to arrange for people to deliberately dig deeper and see.\n\nOfficer Zhang had misunderstood Boss Zhou.\n\nSoon after he left, Boss Zhou had already fallen asleep and had no time to instruct the old Taoist priest or Xu Qinglang to arrange this matter.\n\nEven if he had arranged it, it wouldn't have taken effect so quickly. Smoothing things over, pulling strings, or even the simplest, most brutal intimidation wouldn't be this fast.\n\nThis could only be attributed to a coincidence.\n\nIt just so happened that they were building an underground parking lot, which naturally required a significant excavation depth, and they happened to stumble upon the right location, digging up some items.\n\nWhen Zhang Yanfeng arrived at the construction site, he found that many police officers were also watching the excitement. Fortunately, since it was within the police station's compound, curious onlookers** couldn't enter, so the scene was still orderly.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't surprising that everyone enjoyed this spectacle; construction digging up things was no longer a fresh occurrence across the country.\n\nIn Rongcheng recently, during the renovation of a stadium, an ancient tomb was discovered under the lawn. Considering that stadiums are often used for concerts, this was truly \"dancing on graves.\"\n\nBut Tongcheng was not Rongcheng. Although it had the reputation of \"China's first modern city,\" if you were to talk about things underground, it really couldn't compare to places like Rongcheng or Xi'an. This kind of excitement was truly new for the people of Tongcheng.\n\n\"What did they dig up?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng asked a police officer nearby.\n\n\"Everything that was dug up has been collected here.\" This was an officer from another department, who pointed to the items laid out on a white cloth nearby. \"They're all bits and pieces of small items, and from what I saw, they don't look like antiques. They seem more like modern-era things.\n\nBut to be safe, I've already told them to halt construction. I just called the bureau chief to report, and the chief said to first contact the comrades from the Cultural Relics Bureau to come and take a look.\"\n\nThere were many capable people in the police station. This officer had recently assisted in investigating an antique smuggling case and had a good eye for things.\n\nZhang Yanfeng looked at the items on the white cloth and found that most were ceramics, shaped like small animals, and some memorial tablets, but they didn't seem to be for humans; they were very small and miniature.\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, items from the Republic of China era. The Japs*** liked these shapes. Many Japanese families used to buy these as toys for their children.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng looked up.\n\nHe saw the old Taoist priest squatting opposite him.\n\nNext to the old Taoist priest stood a young girl of blooming age, dressed very provocatively.\n\nZhang Yanfeng recognized the old Taoist priest and nodded to him, mistakenly thinking he was someone sent by Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What's written on these?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng pointed to the Japanese text on the memorial tablets and asked.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was stumped. He was well-informed, but when it came to specialized subjects, he was practically clueless.\n\nMeanwhile, Tang Shi, who was nearby, also squatted down and reached out to touch the memorial tablets.\n\nA police officer nearby instinctively tried to stop her but was deterred by Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"They're for sacrifices, to commemorate small animals,\" Tang Shi said. \"There are also words on this strip of cloth. The Japanese text means 'to commemorate these small animals who dedicated themselves to the Great Japanese Empire, hoping they can bathe in the glory of Amaterasu Omikami,' and so on.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest glanced at Tang Shi with some surprise, \"You understand Japanese?\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just understanding Japanese; she clearly knew a lot about Japanese culture too.\n\nTang Shi ignored the old Taoist priest's question, clapped her hands, and stood up again.\n\nZhang Yanfeng, meanwhile, recalled what Zhou Ze had told him last night. He said that there might be a concentration camp below, and anyone slightly familiar with World War II history would understand what a concentration camp meant.\n\nSo he immediately said to Tang Shi:\n\n\"These are all for Japanese people to commemorate small animals that died in experiments, right?\"\n\nTang Shi nodded.\n\n\"Then, if we continue digging, will we find memorial tablets and urns for people?\"\n\nIt was common knowledge that the Japanese army conducted human bacterial experiments in China during the Sino-Japanese War. Zhang Yanfeng's question now was also in preparation for the subsequent work arrangements. These items would certainly need to be properly handled, as they belonged to suffering people, and moreover, compatriots.\n\nTang Shi shook her head. \"There won't be any.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"When the Unit 731 historical site was organized, places and facilities set up by the Japanese to commemorate small animals in the laboratories were discovered. But for those people who died in the laboratories, used as living specimens, forget memorial tablets or altars; not even their ashes were preserved.\"\n\n\"Why?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\n\"Because in the eyes of the Japanese at that time, Chinese people were worse than animals.\"\n***\n*   Literally \"to swell one's face to look fat,\" meaning to pretend to be wealthy or capable when one is not.\n**  Literally \"melon-eating masses,\" meaning bystanders who are watching an event unfold, often with detached curiosity or amusement.\n*** A derogatory term for Japanese people.",

\n\n\n\n  周澤一直忘不了那個丈夫在爭搶得頭破血流之後，拿到了腳鏈給自己懷孕妻子銬上的情景；\n\n\n\n  在那個丈夫看來，自己已經做到了能做的極致，他放棄了自己離開的機會，把這個機會給了自己的妻子，給了妻子肚子裡自己的孩子。\n\n\n\n  然而，她的妻子剛剛極為痛苦扭曲地死在了手術台上，而他的孩子則是被掏出來，繼續了實驗，換來了那些白大褂嘴裡一聲驚嘆的\n\n\n\n  「喲西」。\n\n\n\n  每一個實驗室都在做著屬於他們自己的項目，嬰兒細菌實驗，肢體續接實驗，甚至人畜雜交實驗等等以一個現代人視角來看幾乎就是天方夜譚狗屁不通的實驗，在這裡卻在沒日沒夜地進行著。\n\n\n\n  不是這裡的日本人中二和異想天開，也不是他們真的沒有足夠的專業素養，而是因為他們的活體標本原材料實在是太過充足，且源源不斷，所以他們可以儘可能地自由自在地去實驗和嘗試那些猶如天方夜譚一般的設想和概念。\n\n\n\n  畢竟對於他們來說，最不值錢的，就是成本，最不缺的，也是成本。\n\n\n\n  周澤去過地獄，見過黃泉路，看過彼岸花，但說心裡話，在這個夢裡，在這個地方，他似乎才算是見識到了什麼才叫真正的「地獄」。\n\n\n\n  代入感，其實就是這麼來的，一點一滴地堆砌，慢慢地浸潤。 \n\n\n\n  也因此，\n\n\n\n  當那個巨大且插著金屬管子的保險柜內部發出那一聲轟鳴之後，\n\n\n\n  周澤的目光再度看向了那個地方，\n\n\n\n  那個他一開始就注意到的地方。\n\n\n\n  原本，他以為那裡是血庫，因為他見過白大褂從裡面抽取血液，注射進孕婦身上的包括注射進自己體內的血液，其實都是從保險柜外的金屬管子裡嫁接出來的。\n\n\n\n  年輕的白大褂此時無比的失魂落魄，嚇得都在哆嗦，嘴裡嘰里咕嚕地不知道在說些什麼，反正周澤也聽不懂。\n\n\n\n  而這個時候，也不知道是白大褂的呼喊聲還是保險柜的那一記悶響，總之，越來越多的白大褂開始聚集到這個實驗室。\n\n\n\n  大部分人臉上都帶著驚恐之色，似乎對著保險柜內的東西，他們有著一種天然的敬畏，但也有幾個頭髮花白的老東西，則是充滿著激動和躍躍欲試。\n\n\n\n  周澤這個試驗品反而在此時被忽略了，周澤覺得自己好像剛剛才破了一個小記錄，但這會兒好像沒人注意到自己。\n\n\n\n  幾個年紀最大或者說是地位最高的白大褂開始了激烈的爭吵，他們吵得面紅耳赤，誰都不願意退後一步。\n\n\n\n  聽著自己聽不懂的語言不停地喧囂，周澤覺得自己頭都有些大了。\n\n\n\n  而這時，那個之前牽著周澤爬行的年輕白大褂走到一個年紀大的身邊，指了指周澤說了些什麼，年長者不耐煩地揮揮手，好像是在說這個時候你拿這種小事打擾我真是沒眼力見兒。 \n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂不停地「哈伊」「哈伊」，表情恭敬誠懇地接受批評。\n\n\n\n  然後走過來，拉扯起周澤出了這間實驗室。\n\n\n\n  興許，\n\n\n\n  是他們暫時沒功夫料理自己吧，而自己身上也確實有了實驗的小突破，所以留著自己還有點用，周澤在心裡這樣想著。\n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂沒把周澤送回牢房，顯然也是不可能被送入牢房的，因為周澤見識過了腳鏈真正的意義，對於這些白大褂來說，他們更希望自己的「馬路大」們更堅強地活著給予他們實驗所用。\n\n\n\n  周澤被推入到了一個空間稍微大一點的房間裡，這裡有半個籃球場大小，年輕白大褂把周澤用細鐵鏈捆綁在一個鐵架子邊，然後對著裡面的幾個正在工作的白大褂交談了幾句，隨後就又馬不停蹄跑回原實驗室去了。\n\n\n\n  周澤就坐在這邊上，一開始，他還在思索，思索剛剛發生的悶響思索著那台保險柜，但很快，周澤的注意力就被自己現在所在的這個房間所吸引了。\n\n\n\n  房間有一個金屬加玻璃的巨大容器，透過部分玻璃，可以看見裡面的情況。\n\n\n\n  裡面有一個女人還有一個女孩，她們似乎是一對母女，因為小女孩依偎在女人身邊，女人則是用手撫摸著女孩的頭在安慰著她。\n\n\n\n  外面的幾個白大褂有一個拿著相機，有一個拿著計時器和寫著什麼數據報告，還有兩個則是站在容器旁邊的一個類似鼓風機一樣的東西旁邊開始運作機器。 \n\n\n\n  一開始，\n\n\n\n  周澤並不清楚這是一種什麼實驗，\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，\n\n\n\n  他看懂了，\n\n\n\n  因為實驗的原理很簡單，他們在不斷地抽出容器內的空氣，有一個儀錶盤上就是顯示著容器內的實時壓強。\n\n\n\n  隨著空氣地不斷被抽出，\n\n\n\n  周澤看見容器內的母女全都趴在了地上，表情無比的痛苦。\n\n\n\n  小女孩脫離了母親的掌控，爬到了容器邊緣，對著外面不停地拍打著容器，但是她的叫喊和哭泣得不到絲毫的反應；\n\n\n\n  四周的白大褂們都在做著自己手頭上的工作，有條不紊，極為熟練。\n\n\n\n  最後，\n\n\n\n  小女孩看向了被綁在角落裡的周澤，\n\n\n\n  她在向周澤求救，\n\n\n\n  她並沒能分辨出來，\n\n\n\n  其實周澤也是他們之中的一員，根本救不了她，或許，這就是小孩的天真吧，而她的母親，可能早就預感到了結局，反而顯得有些平靜。\n\n\n\n  周澤看著容器內的女孩，\n\n\n\n  容器內的女孩也在看著他，\n\n\n\n  兩雙眼眸，就這樣對視著。\n\n\n\n  周澤想做點什麼，但他掙脫不開繩索，他已經在嘗試，已經在努力了，這就意味著其實在不知不覺間，周澤已經忘記了自己只是一個看電影的觀眾，忘記了自己只是一個看客的身份，他代入到了其中，他想要做些什麼，他想要阻止眼前即將發生的一切。 \n\n\n\n  其實，是想阻止……已經發生的事情。\n\n\n\n  原本，再堅固的鎖鏈在自己指甲面前都像是紙糊的一樣，但現在，他卻根本奈何不得。\n\n\n\n  隨著空氣不斷被抽出去，小女孩體內的器官開始從眼睛、嘴巴甚至是**位置開始不停地往外擠壓，凡是身上有孔的地方，都成了體內器官往外溢出的出口。\n\n\n\n  周身的血管隆起，像是一條條密布在身上的蚯蚓。\n\n\n\n  臉脹得像是巨大的海綿，眼球鼓鼓的，卻依舊在死死地盯著周澤，或許，這是她最後的求生本能使然。\n\n\n\n  周澤不停地在掙扎著，希望掙脫這個鐵鏈，不時地發出「咔嚓咔嚓」的摩擦聲，但這種掙扎，顯得有些無濟於事。\n\n\n\n  女孩的身體被慢慢地壓縮和拉長，\n\n\n\n  同時，\n\n\n\n  體內的腸子開始從眼睛和嘴巴里不斷地「出來」，像是一根根活著的東西，自己在鑽出來。\n\n\n\n  這個畫面，\n\n\n\n  讓人頭皮發麻。\n\n\n\n  就像是你走路，不小心踩死了一隻蚯蚓，蚯蚓體內的那些黃的白的一股腦的迸濺了出來，但面前的這是人。\n\n\n\n  你能感觸到她的喜怒哀樂，\n\n\n\n  能感觸到她的痛苦， \n\n\n\n  以及，\n\n\n\n  她的絕望。\n\n\n\n  「吧唧…………」\n\n\n\n  女孩的眼珠像是炸裂了，\n\n\n\n  又像是彈了出來，\n\n\n\n  而後她的身體一陣抽搐之後，\n\n\n\n  頹然地倒在了地上，\n\n\n\n  她終於不再和周澤對視了。\n\n\n\n  但哪怕是死了，\n\n\n\n  她體內的腸子和其他器官還是在不停地被氣壓壓縮出來，那邊負責抽空氣的白大褂們還在繼續工作著。\n\n\n\n  等到空氣抽到極限之後，\n\n\n\n  拍好照片，做好數據記錄，\n\n\n\n  幾個白大褂發出了一聲歡呼，\n\n\n\n  像是到點了，工人下班了，他們可以回宿舍休息去了，誰誰誰手上可能還有慰安所的票，可以去放鬆一下。\n\n\n\n  一個白大褂看見了還在那裡機械麻木地抽動鐵鏈的周澤，\n\n\n\n  指著周澤大笑著，另外幾個同伴也跟著一起笑了起來。\n\n\n\n  周澤是別的實驗室「暫時」放在這裡的，他們當然不會把周澤給一樣送進容器里去，而且，他們今天實驗項目和數據已經完成，可以「下班」休息了。\n\n\n\n  聽到了笑聲， \n\n\n\n  周澤有些茫然地抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  看向前面的這幾個白大褂，\n\n\n\n  只是他抽動捆綁鐵鏈的動作，卻沒有停。\n\n\n\n  知道沒用，\n\n\n\n  畢竟這是夢，\n\n\n\n  再真實，\n\n\n\n  也只是夢，\n\n\n\n  但眼下，似乎只有這個動作，能讓周澤覺得自己好像是在做些什麼，\n\n\n\n  或許，\n\n\n\n  這可以麻痹一下自己。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤還在繼續抽動著鐵鏈。\n\n\n\n  旁邊的幾個白大褂還在笑著。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤腦海中又浮現出了最後小女孩盯著自己的畫面，\n\n\n\n  她的眼睛，\n\n\n\n  原本清澈可愛，\n\n\n\n  到最後「吧唧」一聲，\n\n\n\n  沒了。\n\n\n\n  嘶…………\n\n\n\n  心，\n\n\n\n  忽然好疼，\n\n\n\n  好久沒有再體驗到心疼的感覺了，尤其是在自己沒了心之後。 \n\n\n\n  強忍著胸口的不適感，\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續抽動著鐵鏈。\n\n\n\n  「哐當！」\n\n\n\n  一聲悶響從另外的實驗室傳出！\n\n\n\n  之前周澤所待的第一個實驗室里，幾個白大褂還在爭吵著，附近一群白大褂恭敬地站在旁邊等待著他們爭吵的結果。\n\n\n\n  忽然間，\n\n\n\n  保險柜的門再度從裡面被撞擊了一下！\n\n\n\n  在場所有白大褂都愣住了，\n\n\n\n  一起以一種驚駭莫名地目光看著面前這個巨大的保險柜。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………」周澤繼續抽動。\n\n\n\n  「哐當！！！」保險柜的撞擊聲再度傳來。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  「哐當！！！」\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  「哐當！！！」\n\n\n\n  聲音越來越大，\n\n\n\n  響徹整個研究所，\n\n\n\n  保險柜所在實驗室里的所有白大褂們有的都嚇得直接蹲在了地上，其他實驗室里聽到這個動靜的工作人員也一個個都疑惑不解，紛紛放下手頭的工作走出來想查看一下情況。\n\n\n\n  唯有周澤現在所在的這個實驗室里的這幾個白大褂， \n\n\n\n  正在以一種看怪物的目光看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  臉上寫滿了恐懼，\n\n\n\n  因為他們驚訝地發現，\n\n\n\n  周澤每次抽動鐵鏈的頻率，\n\n\n\n  和那巨大悶響發出的頻率，\n\n\n\n  一模一樣！",

    "content": "「Snap...」\n\n「Clang!」\n\n「Snap...」\n\n「Clang!」\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze had already forgotten that this place was a dream; and everything that happened in the dream might have been fated eighty years ago. The dream only told you an ending, told you a process, told you a predetermined fact. After all, who could change the future?\n\nCalmly observing according to popular values, what Zhou Ze was doing now seemed utterly meaningless. What impact could constantly struggling and relentlessly toiling in a dream possibly have?\n\nNaïve, crude, boring, even worse than a child who liked to squat in a corner and watch ants fight.\n\nBoss Zhou never thought of himself as a good person, because being a good person was too tiring, and sometimes too much of a grievance. That teacher, who wore a tall hat that couldn't be removed even after death, was the best proof.\n\nBoss Zhou was always quite *salted fish*^1, even by chance, he had eaten his own conscience; recalling that taste, it was truly not bad. After losing his conscience, things became as he wished.\n\nThings he shouldn't manage, he wouldn't; things he was too lazy to manage, he wouldn't; troublesome things, he wouldn't.\n\nEven if *floods reached the sky*^2 outside, I would just stay in my bookstore, continue basking in the sun and drinking my civet coffee.\n\nBut some things are said one way, and thought another. It's just that, when you are locked here, watching this scene unfold before your eyes, watching that little girl's gaze, fixed on you until her death, watching her whole body slowly squeezed and stretched like toothpaste, watching those still twitching intestines, one by one—those scenes, what they brought Zhou Ze wasn't disgust, nor fear. He had walked through hell, experienced life and death; what could he truly be afraid of?\n\nBut that feeling, that suppression, crushed down like a flood!\n\nThe numb prisoners in the cells, grabbing with hope at the shackles thrown over by the guards, husbands desperately fighting for them, entrusting the \"beautiful\" hope to their wives, to their unborn children.\n\nScene after scene, constantly flashed in Zhou Ze's mind, like a slideshow.\n\nZhou Ze's breathing began to slow, his movements also slowed, but they remained powerful. Each pull was accompanied by the further blurring of the flesh and blood at his wrist; that stinging pain, that tearing sensation, at this moment seemed so insignificant.\n\nOn the laboratory table, lay the twisted, vein-bulging corpse of a pregnant woman, the baby, still struggling in pain, held in a palm, five mothers on stretchers, their bellies cut open, men and women forced to crossbreed with animals for bloodline research, the woman whose hands had been frozen for who knows how long, shattering and falling off with a single hammer strike, yet her face was numb, including, the mother and daughter still lying in the sealed container, not yet dealt with.\n\nThis bystander, truly couldn't stand by any longer. The reason he could deliberately dismiss it and give himself psychological comfort before had completely lost its effect at this moment.\n\nFury, suppression, grief, at this moment transformed into roars from Zhou Ze's hoarse voice!\n\n「Ah!!!!」\n\nZhou Ze shrieked hysterically, his arms began to pull even more frantically and continuously. He wanted to break free from all of this, he wanted to break free from this chain locking his arm, he wanted to rush over, tear apart, one by one, these bastards in white coats who behaved like beasts and pigs. He wanted to skin and devour them alive, he wanted to drink their blood, he wanted to eat their flesh, he wanted to seize their lingering souls, not give them a chance to go to the Yellow Springs or enter hell, he wanted to torment them day and night, make them suffer endless pain!\n\nYou treat all of this as child's play, you treat this place as your own playground, you treat living human lives as \"Maruta\" ^3, as peeled logs. You think you are masters, you think you are demons walking among men, you think you control everything, control life and death!\n\nGood, then today I will let you see what a true devil looks like!\n\nCrawling out of hell, walking back from the Yellow Springs path, emerging from the Abyssal Pool, I will make you witness what true terror is, I will return the torment and pain you inflicted upon others...\n\nTenfold, hundredfold, thousandfold, ten thousandfold, back to you!\n\n「Ah ah ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!」\n\nThe shriek continued, a silent roar thundered in his heart. Zhou Ze laughed loudly, his face contorted.\n\n「Snap! Snap! Snap! Snap!!!!!!!!!!!」\n\nThe frequency of his arm pulling the chain began to quicken, faster and faster, so fast it felt exaggerated.\n\nIn the eyes of these few white coats, Zhou Ze at this moment was like a beast desperate to escape, at any cost. Even if it meant self-mutilation, he had to break free from the chains, and choose people to devour!\n\n...............\n\n「Clang!」\n\n「Clang!」\n\n「Clang!」\n\nThe sounds of impact from inside the safe continuously came forth. The nearly ten white coats in this laboratory all wore solemn expressions at this moment. The weaker ones were even prostrate on the ground, almost kowtowing. They knew what was stored inside, and thus understood how terrifying it was for the thing inside to suddenly start banging against the safe. Yes, they also knew horror; even though their hands were typically stained with blood, even though each of them was a butcher, an executioner, they could still feel fear and dread.\n\nOne elderly white coat, who had argued most fiercely before, suddenly rushed forward at this moment. He actually embraced the safe's bolt, caressing it reverently, like a man seeing his first love. He was very excited, he was ecstatic, he was loudly saying something in Japanese, like giving a speech, or singing praises. His behavior seemed very crazy, very difficult to understand.\n\nBut this was a nest of perverts, a dwelling for \"demons.\" The relevant personnel living and \"working\" here could not be measured as ordinary people.\n\nUnder the old man's extremely excited speech, many white coats around him also showed expressions of longing and excitement on their faces. They began to embrace, they began to weep with joy, they began to cheer, they began to exult.\n\nJapanese human bacterial experiment research had been ongoing for a long time, but their truly useful discovery, an invention that could play a small role in the front-line war situation, was the method for filtering and treating outdoor drinking water unexpectedly found during the germ warfare experiments. This method did indeed help the Japanese army fighting in Southeast Asia reduce some problems like malaria caused by water issues. Aside from that, throughout the entire human experimentation research, there was no second usable discovery or achievement.\n\nAlthough raw materials were easy and convenient to obtain, and extremely \"cheap,\" the Japanese military had also poured vast resources into these research institutes. The prolonged lack of results, and inability to truly support the expansion and operations of the Great Japanese Empire, made the pressure on these researchers exceptionally high.\n\nAnd at this moment, the sounds of impact from inside the safe let them see the dawn of hope, the hope of their own success. The thing stored in this safe had actually come alive!\n\nThis was a miracle, a miracle protected by His Majesty the Emperor, a glory bestowed upon the Yamato race by Amaterasu Omikami, it was the future of the entire Great Japanese Empire!\n\nThe sounds of impact continued, and the safe began to shake with them, but this safe was too thick and heavy; therefore, even though the thing inside kept banging, it still couldn't get out.\n\nWhite coats from other laboratories in the institute were also attracted by this huge commotion. They all put down their current experiments and came to see what was happening. In some laboratories, experiments were still ongoing, but the white coats had left. They didn't care if this experiment's data would be discarded; anyway, there was no shortage of living specimens. If it wasn't done well this time, they could just do it again.\n\nGradually, inside and outside the laboratory with the safe, seventy or eighty staff members stood, looking inside and constantly communicating.\n\nThe old man hugging the safe was very excited, and his words were highly inflammatory. Gradually, more and more white coats began to echo him. They were excited, they were mad, they laughed happily.\n\nSomeone began to sing a Japanese military song, this atmosphere began to spread, the old man holding the safe also sang loudly. Slowly, everyone seemed to be absorbed into this emotional state; the \"loud and sonorous\" military song formed a grand chorus here. They even had tears in their eyes, feeling that their \"hard work\" had not been in vain, feeling that their \"sacrifices\" had not been unappreciated. They were celebrating, they were singing loudly, they felt they were a lucky group of people, \"pioneers\" witnessing the imminent complete rise of the Great Japanese Empire.\n\nPerhaps, only the four white coats in the same laboratory as Zhou Ze understood best what was happening. When the central laboratory was singing loudly to the continuous banging from the safe, the four white coats in this laboratory only felt a chill in their hearts. Every time Zhou Ze pulled the chain, a huge \"thud\" simultaneously came from the distant safe. They knew clearly, it was this man, it was this Maruta, who caused the vibration, who caused the reaction!\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's madness continued. He pulled frantically, hysterically, recklessly. His flesh and blood had long since begun to tear, fresh blood began to splatter, but he still showed no intention of stopping!\n\nEspecially when Zhou Ze heard the singing from afar, his suppressed emotions were completely and utterly ignited!\n\nYou, are still singing!!!\n\n「Ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!」\n\n「Snap!!!!!!!!!!!」\n\nThe chain didn't move, but Zhou Ze gained freedom, because at his wrist, it had actually been forcibly torn off by himself!\n\n「Clang!」\n\nAt the same time, inside the laboratory that was still singing loudly, the safe, which had originally appeared \"impenetrable,\" suddenly cracked open a hole, and a scarred, bony hand reached out from within.\n\nThe singing, at this moment, came to an abrupt halt............\n\n---\n^1: A colloquial term indicating someone who is lazy, apathetic, or lacks ambition.\n^2: An idiom meaning 'even if there's a huge disaster' or 'even if chaos reigns supreme'.\n^3: \"Maruta\" (丸太) was a codename used by Unit 731 of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II for human subjects used in experiments, literally meaning \"logs.\" This term is translated directly for historical accuracy.",

    "content": "A sturdy and huge safe,\njust like that, abruptly had a hole punched through it.\nThe surrounding temperature also began to rapidly drop.\nThat skeletal hand,\nwas less than two decimeters away from the old man in the white coat, who had been clutching the safe.\n\nThe old man raised his head, looking at the skeletal hand, his expression twitching. He seemed to have lost all the vigor and passion he had during his speech earlier. His lower body was trembling slightly, and if not for his body pressing against the safe to barely maintain balance, he might have already collapsed onto the ground.\n\nBecause he was closest to this hand,\nhis perception was also the deepest.\nEspecially just now,\nhe clearly perceived that the safe, which had previously been incredibly sturdy and capable of withstanding many impacts, seemed to have instantly turned into military-issue compressed biscuits, becoming so fragile.\n\nThe crowd, who had previously been singing military songs in unison here, also collectively fell silent. They were somewhat at a loss, and somewhat terrified.\n\nThis was their research institute. Normally, they were the ones who inflicted fear. Now, the reversal of roles made it somewhat difficult for them to accept for a moment.\nOh no,\nit wasn't that they couldn't accept it,\nit was that they found it hard to get used to.\n\n\"Crack... crack... crack...\"\nThe huge bolt of the freezer slowly shattered at this moment.\nImmediately after,\nthe freezer's door was slowly pushed open.\nThe old man's body also fell to the ground. He wanted to remain standing, but still collapsed onto the ground, raising his head to look in the direction of the freezer.\n\nInside the freezer,\nwas a corpse,\na corpse severely damaged.\n\nHalf of the corpse's head was missing, as if it had been severed in one clean piece. The wound was unusually smooth, even emitting an eerie sheen.\n\nBelow the half-face, the sole remaining eye was tightly shut, showing no sign of opening. A huge fissure extended from the head all the way down to the body below, as if a gully had once been carved into the body.\n\nAt its left chest, there was a huge gaping wound, a penetrating injury that allowed one to see through to the other side. The ribs inside were clearly visible.\n\nOn the corpse's limbs, some parts were covered with flesh, while others were completely exposed bone, revealing a chilling coldness.\n\nThe most profound impression this corpse gave was its bones, which were like jade, possessing a translucent and smooth quality, even giving a pleasing aesthetic sensation.\n\nAll the white coats present were \"researchers\" in live experiments. They had personally concocted countless horrific experiments and naturally possessed a far greater understanding than ordinary people of the limits of human life!\n\nThis was a person who couldn't be deader.\nIt was impossible for him to still be alive, and there was no reason for him to continue to be alive.\n\nBut there was only him inside the safe,\nso who else could have struck the safe earlier but him?\n\nFurthermore,\nit was his hand that had pierced through this thick safe.\nJust as everyone was singing loudly,\njust when everyone was at their most joyous,\nhe abruptly poured a basin of cold water on everyone, drawing a rest note for this piece of music.\n\nThe corpse stood there motionless,\nmaintaining a posture with its arm half-raised.\nFrom the moment the safe door slowly opened,\nit hadn't moved again.\n\nHe was as still as a work of art, emanating a magnificent aura, even creating a beauty akin to that of the Venus de Milo.\n\nThe old man, sitting on the ground and still shaken just moments ago, seeing this scene, raised his arms again and shouted something in Japanese. He was still excited, still thrilled, and still optimistic.\n\nPerhaps,\nevery team needs someone like him to maintain the team's morale.\n\nBut this time,\nbefore he could infect his nearby colleagues,\nthe previously motionless skeletal hand slowly descended.\nIt was as if it found him too noisy,\nand fell naturally,\nwanting to interrupt his incessant chatter,\nyet also like a loving elder,\nwanting to,\npat your head.\n\nThis was a caress of love.\nThe old man was not afraid, because the corpse's movements were very slow; you could even sense an emotion called gentleness.\n\nThe old man grew even more excited.\nHe increasingly believed this was a divine miracle bestowed upon the Great Japanese Empire by Amaterasu Ōmikami, an opportunity for the empire to rise and dominate. And he, was the witness and discoverer.\nHis name,\nwas destined to be inscribed in the most prominent position at Yasukuni Shrine in the future!\n\nIn this place,\nengaging in this kind of research,\nperhaps some people themselves hadn't realized,\nthat their hearts and characters had long since become twisted.\n\nJust like the old man at this moment,\nafter overcoming the initial inability to be afraid,\nhis heart was replaced by ecstasy.\n\nNone of the nearby white coats screamed. They felt fear and dread, but no one chose to leave. Instead, they all stood rooted to the spot, seemingly waiting for the situation to develop further.\n\nIn everyone's heart, there was a hint of good fortune, and a hint of expectation, always feeling that if Heaven were to choose to favor one person or a group of people,\nit would very likely be themselves.\n\nThen,\nthe situation developed.\nThe skeletal hand gently landed on the old man's head.\nImmediately after,\nthe old man's face, still beaming with a happy and joyful smile,\nin an instant, was like an ice sculpture on which hot water had been poured,\nand began to melt rapidly.\n\nHis wrinkled skin,\nhis sunken eye sockets,\nhis somewhat flattened nose,\nhis hair,\neverything on his head,\ninstantly decayed,\nalmost in the blink of an eye,\nthe old man's head turned into a skull.\n\nAnd at this moment,\nthe old man, who was directly experiencing this sensation, finally managed to let out a painful scream.\nThe skull's mouth was wide open,\nbut he could no longer make a sound, as if letting out a silent roar!\n\nA Japanese officer once wrote in his memoirs that after quickly beheading a Chinese person with a katana, for a short period, the severed head, lying on the ground, could still blink its eyes.\n\nAnd this time,\nthis scene,\nin an even more extreme and direct manner,\nreplicated this experiment!\n\nAfter the silent roar, the old man's corpse slumped to one side.\n\nOnly then did the group of white coats gathered inside and outside the laboratory start to panic, frantically fleeing outwards. Faced with such an inconceivable sight, their minds collapsed in an instant!\n\nTheir piety towards the Empire, their loyalty to the Emperor, under this inconceivable shock, were like a piece of paper instantly torn to shreds!\n\nA demon,\na true demon,\nhad appeared!\n\n...\n\nInside the sealed container,\nthe horrific corpses of the mother and daughter had not yet been dealt with; they lay there quietly.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if their spirits were still there,\nor if they would remain here to watch all of this.\n\nBecause at this moment,\nZhou Ze's perspective was merely that of an ordinary person.\n\nHis half-severed arm appeared somewhat empty and uncoordinated, but Zhou Ze still steadfastly walked towards the four white coats in front of him.\n\nIn the eyes of the four white coats, Zhou Ze was a hungry wolf, a wolf that had gone mad.\n\nThey originally had no fear of Maruta¹, but Zhou Ze was different. His self-mutilating spirit was already astounding, and while others weren't aware, they knew that the roaring sounds that echoed throughout the entire research institute earlier were actually responding to the frequency of this man's chain pulling.\n\nA demon,\nhad been released from its cage,\nand descended upon the human world.\nBut ironically,\nthe first thing the demon did after descending,\nwas to cleanse the sins here,\nbecause he found that this place,\nwas more like hell,\nthan the hell he was supposed to be in.\n\nAlarm bells rang out at this moment. From several entrances of the research institute, fully armed military police began to pour in. Their purpose was to suppress any potential riots within the institute.\n\nUnfortunately,\nthey, having received orders, were not simultaneously informed that this time what they were suppressing was not the so-called disobedient Maruta, but a devil who had just broken free from its restraints.\nA,\ntrue demon!\n\nSeveral military police first entered this laboratory. They were somewhat perplexed as to why a one-armed Maruta could scare these four researchers into retreating step by step, unwilling to approach. Nevertheless, they professionally raised their guns and aimed them at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze stopped his forward steps,\nturned his body sideways,\nthen turned his head,\nlooking at the dark muzzles already aimed at him.\n\nThe four white coats almost simultaneously roared something, as if impatiently ordering these military police to open fire and execute this fellow who had sent chills down their spines!\n\nTo be honest,\nwhether in his previous life or this one,\nZhou Ze had apparently never truly faced gun muzzles,\nespecially not a scene with a whole row of guns.\n\nEven though he was currently just an ordinary person,\neven though he had just had to resort to self-mutilation to break free from a thin iron chain,\nbut for some reason,\nZhou Ze now,\nwas genuinely not flustered at all.\nNot only did he not feel flustered,\nbut he even found it a bit amusing.\n\nThis feeling,\nwas very peculiar,\njust like an adult,\nwatching a group of children under five years old pointing squirt guns at him, threatening him.\n\nZhou Ze even felt that they,\nwere a little bit cute.\n\nZhou Ze also wasn't sure where this mentality of his came from,\nnor did he understand why he had swelled with such unreasoning confidence so quickly.\n\nBut just as these military police were about to pull their triggers,\nbehind them,\na figure appeared.\nHe appeared suddenly, like a ghost,\nwithout the slightest warning.\n\n\"Ahhhh!!!!\"\n\"Ahhh!!!!\"\nIn an instant,\nthese five armed military police, after letting out screams, turned into dried corpses and fell to the ground. Their military uniforms, on the ground, appeared so wide and baggy.\n\nThe four white coats were so terrified that some collapsed onto the ground, some shivered leaning against the wall, and some simply squatted down, clutching their heads and weeping bitterly, continuously shouting in Japanese:\n\"Demon! Demon!!!!\"\n\nAt this moment, they truly experienced the perspective and feeling that their test subjects had when they conducted experiments in the laboratory.\n\nZhou Ze looked at this fellow who had suddenly appeared.\nHis body, which couldn't be more broken,\nhis head with only half a face remaining, and the hollow area of his chest.\n\nThe other party's previously tightly shut eyes slowly opened at this moment. In the depths of the eye sockets was a terrifying void.\n\nBut in the midst of it all, there was truly a feeling,\nthat he was also looking at himself.\n\nFamiliarity,\na strange familiarity,\nit was a synchronization of bloodlines—no, it was a resonance that transcended blood ties!\n\nNo extensive introduction was needed, nor even much hesitation,\nafter all, that feeling,\nwas simply too clear, and certainly couldn't be mistaken!\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips,\nand said somewhat hoarsely:\n\"You... are me?\"\n\nThe other party did not answer,\nmerely continued to stand there calmly, as if nothing in this world could spark the slightest interest in him, except for... Zhou Ze, right before him.\n\nZhou Ze parted his lips,\nand smiled.\nHe finally understood,\nwhat was inside the safe in that laboratory.\nWhat it actually was,\nIt turned out...\nit was himself!\n\nThat group of deranged Japanese, obsessed with insane experiments, had somehow, from somewhere unknown, discovered his former corpse, stored it as a specimen, transported it here, and subjected it to research and analysis.\n\nFurthermore,\nthe blood that the young white coat had drawn from the safe earlier in the laboratory was actually from his own body!\n\nThe Japanese wanted to use his body as a template,\nthey wanted to... create a god!\n\nNo wonder he couldn't escape this dream, no wonder even after waking up he would be dragged back in again, no wonder this dream was so real!\n\nAll the reasons, all the causes, at this moment, finally had a definite answer!\n\nBecause back then, in this research institute,\nhe himself was already here!\n\nWhen children are young,\nboth parents and teachers will teach you how to communicate and converse with others,\nbut no one probably teaches you,\nhow to talk to yourself,\nand not just the metaphorical \"self-reflection,\" the literary exaggeration of communicating with one's inner self,\nbut in the true sense, when you face another you,\nhow exactly should you communicate?\n\nZhou Ze was also somewhat bewildered now.\nAnd bewilderment led to a loss for words.\nHe didn't know what to say,\nnor what to do.\n\nBut in an instant,\nhe suddenly thought of a crucial matter.\nThat was,\nif the dream couldn't be changed,\nif the dream was a pre-ordained fact,\nif the dream was merely a record, a presentation of what had happened in the past!\n\nThen,\ndid this mean that,\nat this very moment, nearly eighty years ago,\nhis own corpse,\ntruly awoke?\nIn this research institute,\nit awoke?\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked at the mother and daughter inside the sealed container. They had only just died, especially the little girl. Right before him, the two had looked at each other, slowly tortured to death.\n\nZhou Ze's voice was slightly trembling,\nas he slowly said:\n\"Kill them... all of them.\"\n\nThe broken figure turned around,\nas if having heard a command,\nor perhaps,\nhe was simply following his own will.\n\nHere,\nthere was no superior-subordinate command,\nit was just himself... helping himself, himself asking himself, himself demanding of himself,\nhe wanted to do this,\nand then,\n\"himself\" would go and do it.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head. He remembered the scene of the five military police dying earlier. He felt that such a quick and decisive death,\nwas too simple,\nand too easy for them.\n\nFinally,\nas the broken body walked towards the four white coats in the corner,\nZhou Ze added two more words, setting the proper tone for this action:\nThat was:\n\"Tortured... slaughter...\"\n\n---\n¹ Maruta (丸太): A Japanese term, literally meaning \"logs,\" used by Imperial Japan's Unit 731 to refer to human subjects for gruesome biological experiments during World War II.",

    "content": "Here, it was originally \"Inferno,\" only now, it had an added layer of what could be called unadulterated authenticity.\n\nJust like some counterfeits of major international brands, the difference in quality is truly minimal, with some fakes even surpassing the genuine articles in quality. But in the eyes of consumers, the genuine article possesses an aura, an authenticity, that belongs to it.\n\nCurrently,\nthe true demon had descended.\nAll beings were equal.\nBefore Hell,\ncollectively,\nthey trembled!\n\nThe instruments in various laboratories vibrated at this moment, as if sensing a magnetic field and a summons. The former lethal weapons and tools seemed to have gained their own consciousness at this instant.\n\nThey began to cheer, they became active, and they were even somewhat impatient, awaiting a new round of the demon's feast.\n\nThere were the scraping sounds of chains, the clattering of scalpels and surgical forceps, the creaking of stretchers, the rustling of doors and windows. Even from the incineration workshop, where bodies were cremated,\n\nashes,\nflew about randomly.\n\nA series of sounds, high or low, orderly or chaotic, were perfectly integrated at this moment, forming a stirring rhythm. It was like Beethoven's *Fate Symphony*, slowly raising its curtain at this moment, moving towards its cli…max.\n\nThis was an aura, and also an atmosphere-setting; truly eerie, truly terrifying. It was somewhat like the candlelight on a table; it wouldn't bring any change in taste to the dishes,\n\nbut this sense of ritual,\nwas indispensable.\n\nZhou Ze, with half an arm missing, walked slowly, ever so slowly, through this research institute;\n\nwatching his eighty-year-old self carry out his judgment, his slaughter.\n\nFor the first time,\nZhou Ze truly realized,\nthat death,\nwas indeed an art.\n\nBearing its unique rhythm,\ncontaining its distinctive charm,\nlike a fine wine aged for many years in a cellar; before even drinking it, one was already intoxicated by its aroma. And now, slowly savoring it sip by sip, the wine's fragrance entered the mouth, permeated the nose, and finally settled in the stomach, its fiery warmth instantly coursing through the entire body.\n\nSo satisfying and exhilarating, it made you almost unable to restrain yourself from letting out a moan of ecstasy!\n\nThe white coats in the institute scurried about like headless flies, screaming, weeping, howling. After the identities of demon and Maruta* were swapped, it was proven that there was simply no such thing as one being nobler than the other. In the same position and circumstances, everyone was the same.\n\nBack then, when they faced the struggles and wails of the prisoners inside the experimental grounds, they could perhaps still chat and laugh, and even discuss which comfort station attendant offered more passionate service nearby.\n\nAt that time, they were outside, others were inside. But now, they had entered the inside, and thus no longer possessed the carefree leisure they had enjoyed when they were outside.\n\nThey encountered the most terrifying \"ghost-wall\" phenomenon**, knowing they needed to run but utterly unable to escape.\n\nJust like the white mice kept by their handlers in containers within the laboratories, their fate, was already sealed.\n\nDue to Zhou Ze's special instructions,\nthe ensuing death scenes did not have the abruptness of the initial ones. Before, it was like an ephemeral flower's fleeting bloom; now, it was like guiding you from a flower bud to a partially opened bloom, to its full blossoming, and then its eventual wilting.\n\nNo process could be omitted, no step could be missing.\nFrom the cultivation of fear, to the early suppression, the mid-stage details, and the late-stage extension of pain, the flower of life, so delicate, was slowly roasted and branded by countless methods.\n\nYou would not be allowed to die easily, nor simply. Every bit of your fear would be drained, your final suffering released. Not even your souls would be spared.\n\nDo not think that the end of the physical body is liberation.\nThe true state of neither living nor dying actually only begins after your physical body perishes.\n\nYou must know, the soul is even more sensitive than the physical body, and the torments of Hell are mostly aimed at the soul.\n\nIf the physical body is compared to the foreskin***, then the soul is the glans**** hidden within it.\n\nEveryone understands which is more sensitive.\n\nThe art of slaughter,\nthe vortex of death,\nconstantly clamoring, constantly lingering, and constantly intertwining.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head.\nHe saw the blood on the ground also seemed to come alive, constantly shifting its appearance like a master of ink wash landscape painting wielding his brush.\n\nEerie, profound, ghostly talismans, like stars adorning the night sky, carrying an undisguised mischievous mockery and sarcasm.\n\nPuddles of blood continuously spread forth, transforming into blood-red lotus flowers at Zhou Ze's feet. On each petal was a face contorted in pain—the departed souls of the freshly dead white coats. This was their imprisonment, their feast of terror.\n\nIt was like watching images on a black and white television as a child—lines, and patches of blank space. The lines were messy, and the white wasn't quite white. Amidst the chaotic and disturbing changes, it made one dizzy, nauseous, and sick to the stomach.\n\nZhou Ze bent down.\nHe clutched his chest with his sole remaining hand.\nHe felt a little like vomiting.\n\nIt wasn't sympathy, nor pity, just a simple surprise.\nHis eighty-year-old self,\ncompared to his current self,\nseemed even more ruthless and cruel.\n\nThat incomplete body continued to walk amidst it all,\nleisurely and unhurriedly, as if admiring his own masterpiece.\n\nAt certain moments,\nhe would appear before a still-living white coat, treating them as a side dish, throwing them into this stirring symphony to become a musical note within it, or freshly pressing out their blood to supplement this crimson romantic watercolor.\n\nHe did not grin maliciously.\nIn fact, except for the moment he first opened his eyes to look at Zhou Ze, he kept his eyes closed.\n\nHe appeared somewhat unconcerned,\nbut he was like the most perfectionist artist, a conductor. He meticulously fulfilled his duties, making sure everything, everything, was done to the best, to make the audience... satisfied.\n\nOh no,\nit was actually to make himself satisfied.\n\nA dream spanning eighty years of time,\nwith each situated at opposite ends of the timeline.\nWhat exactly was a dream?\nAnd what were the false parts that a dream could alter?\nZhou Ze did not understand, could not comprehend.\n\nBut perhaps,\nhis eighty-year-old self, awakening here, beginning the slaughter here, beginning to purify himself—this should be real.\n\nAs for whether he saw his current self from eighty years later, or whether, because he accepted his commission, he made this otherwise simple slaughter more complicated, more tiring, more protracted, and more enjoyable—\n\nthat remained unknown.\n\nIf he wanted to know the truth,\nhe could only wait to unearth the secrets buried underground,\nleave this dream,\nand in reality,\nexamine the traces left behind from eighty years ago.\nOnly then could he make the most accurate judgment.\n\nHowever,\nall of a sudden,\neverything seemed to accelerate in pace.\nZhou Ze suddenly noticed the blood on the ground, which had been shifting its patterns, began to boil.\nThe white coats and military police, who had previously been waiting their turn to be thrown into this feast, were almost en masse shoved into the various laboratories. The experiments in the labs resumed. Tools and instruments began to operate on their own. All kinds of experiments restarted. Even the record books and pens danced about on their own, making their own records.\n\nOnly, the raw materials were no longer the Maruta they used to speak of, but themselves.\n\nBut this change in rhythm inexplicably alarmed Zhou Ze. When he looked at the mutilated figure again, he found that the figure had appeared right in front of him.\n\nHe clutched his own half-severed head with both hands,\nappearing greatly pained.\nHis body was also swaying uncontrollably,\nas if he could no longer restrain himself.\n\nEverything around him was his handiwork, his art of death. Everything changed according to his state of mind. And when he began to gradually descend into madness, into loss of control, everything around him also began to extend towards a cruel aesthetic of violence.\n\nScreams,\nwails,\nfrom the living,\nfrom the departed souls,\nthey suffered even more unbearably within it.\n\nSuddenly,\nthe mutilated figure opened his eyes. His pupils were blood-red, and for a moment, Zhou Ze felt dazed.\n\nHe was shouting something at him,\nhe was telling him something,\nbut damn it,\nwhy couldn't he hear a single word!\n\n\"I can't hear you! What are you saying!\"\nZhou Ze shouted back at him. He knew that what the other person was saying must be very important. It might even be a message left for him by his eighty-year-old self.\n\nThrough… the form of a dream.\n\nBut he couldn't hear anything, truly nothing at all. Furthermore, the other party was on the verge of losing control, almost roaring as he shouted, so even if Zhou Ze understood lip-reading, he wouldn't be able to decipher what was being said.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\"Boom!\"\nA series of explosions rang out.\nIt was the sound of several exits being blown up. The Japanese above no longer dared to go down, intending to seal off the place.\n\nAnd at this moment,\nthe mutilated figure seemed to grow more and more frantic.\nThe blood on the ground continuously rose at this time, slowly covering everything. At first, it only reached Zhou Ze's feet, then slowly rose to his knees, and finally, went above his waist.\n\nZhou Ze desperately wanted to call out to that figure again. He wanted to know what he had just said, but Zhou Ze didn't have time to speak again, nor to do anything else, because the blood had already engulfed him entirely.\n\n\"Gurgle…………\"\nHis body,\nfelt like it plunged into the deep sea.\nAll around,\nwas a despair-inducing solitude.\nAnd below,\na mutilated figure,\nseemed to also be looking up, looking upwards, but the distance between the two rapidly increased at a speed visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe buoyancy grew stronger and stronger, Zhou Ze's ascent became faster and faster, and the suffocating sense of panic intensified.\n\n\"Splash…………\"\nWhen Zhou Ze surfaced,\nhe sat upright directly from the sofa.\n\n\"Hoo-hoo………… Hoo-hoo…………… Hoo-hoo………………\"\nZhou Ze was drenched in sweat, soaked from head to toe.\nBeside him, Bai Yingying was still asleep, but her hair had returned to a maiden's black, and even her skin had become tighter and more elastic, as if a pinch could make water spring forth.\n\nLike a fresh bloom, thoroughly moisturized by the morning dew.\n\nZhou Ze reached up and clutched his forehead.\nHe hadn't fully recovered his senses yet.\nThe previous scenes had simply been too frantic, and too alarming. Especially the sense of artistry embodied within that slaughter, making one feel as if they were standing in the very center of a symphony orchestra—\n\nNo, the epicenter of a tsunami!\n\nJust then,\nZhou Ze's phone rang.\nHe glanced at the screen.\nIt was Zhang Yanfeng's call.\nHe answered the phone with a weak \"Hello.\"\nZhang Yanfeng on the other end sounded very excited. There was also the loud roaring sound of machinery beside him. He shouted loudly:\n\n\"Hey, the higher-ups have agreed, they're going to start digging, they're going to start digging…………\"\n\nStart digging?\nZhou Ze was still a bit dazed.\nDigging what?\n\nBut quickly,\nZhou Ze snapped wide awake.\nHe immediately held the phone to his mouth and roared:\n\n\"Don't dig! Don't dig now!\nAbsolutely must not dig it out!!!\"\n\n——————\n——————\nPS: It's a new month, everyone, please cast your guaranteed monthly passes***** for the Dragon******.\nDon't panic,\nhug the Dragon tight!\n\n---\n*   **Maruta (馬路大)**: A Japanese term, literally \"logs,\" used by Unit 731 of the Imperial Japanese Army to refer to human subjects used for biological and chemical experimentation during World War II.\n**   **Ghost-wall (鬼打牆)**: A Chinese folk belief referring to a phenomenon where one becomes disoriented and walks in circles, unable to find their way out of a seemingly ordinary area, often attributed to supernatural forces.\n***  **Foreskin (包P)**: A vulgar slang term for foreskin (包皮).\n**** **Glans (貴頭)**: A vulgar slang term for the glans penis, literally \"noble head.\"\n***** **Guaranteed monthly pass (保底月票)**: A type of subscription or voting ticket specific to online Chinese novel platforms, allowing readers to support their favorite authors at the beginning of each month.\n****** **Dragon (龍)**: A common self-reference or alias used by the author of a web novel.",

    "content": "After hanging up the phone, Zhou Ze reached out and rubbed his face, letting out a long breath. As he stood up, he woke Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying rubbed her eyes, lying horizontally on the sofa, revealing her two slender yet shapely legs, her feet lightly crossed, her curves fully displayed.\n\nShe possessed a woman's charm and a maiden's innocence.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nHer voice was soft and endearing, carrying a natural intimacy and childlike admiration.\n\n\"I'm so comfortable, so satisfied.\"\n\n\"...Zhou Ze.\"\n\nAt this moment, Xu Qinglang, wearing a padded jacket, was sitting by the bar counter drinking hot tea, with a heater placed next to him, earphones in, listening to music, looking utterly carefree.\n\nOutside the shop door, it was midsummer; pedestrians were being baked by the scorching sun, while inside, it felt like winter had arrived.\n\nAll day today, he mostly sat in the bookstore for a while, then ran outside for another stroll. He was truly enjoying himself immensely.\n\nAn experience of extreme contrasts, tsk-tsk, interesting.\n\nMany people have had the experience of missing winter in summer, and missing summer in winter. This time, Xu Qinglang truly had his fill of it.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze wake up, Xu Qinglang stretched, as if he hadn't experienced enough, a veritable long-neglected resentful wife*.\n\n\"Give me your car keys,\" Zhou Ze said directly.\n\nXu Qinglang exhaled a puff of white air, took the car keys from his pocket, and tossed them to Zhou Ze.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze about to go out, Bai Yingying immediately tried to get off the sofa to follow her boss out to run an errand, but as soon as she got off, she let out a soft whimper and fell to the floor.\n\n\"Whimper,\nBoss,\nMy legs are weak.\"\n\nThis time, she was completely sated, having fully replenished all the vitality she had previously lost. Her entire being was filled with an indescribable sense of satisfaction; even her bones felt like jelly.\n\n\"You rest well.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't intend to bring Bai Yingying. Instead, he went straight outside, got into the car, and drove off.\n\nOn the road, Zhou Ze drove fast, because just now, on the phone, although he had repeatedly told them to stop work and cease excavation, Zhou Ze knew that Zhang Yanfeng did not have absolute authority to handle this matter.\n\nFurthermore, whether Zhang Yanfeng would actually listen to him and agree to help stop all this was also an unknown.\n\nAfter all, putting himself in Zhang Yanfeng's shoes, the matter of the iron chain had become a nightmarish obsession for him for twenty years. Now that he had a chance to resolve this deep-seated issue, how could he possibly hold back?\n\nThat place had always been sealed away. Eighty years ago, the events in his dream occurred. Zhou Ze remembered that at the end of the dream, the Japanese destroyed the entrance and exit passages of the research institute. In the present time, later generations had no knowledge whatsoever about this matter or this place. It was very likely that the Japanese had deliberately suppressed the information.\n\nTherefore, for approximately eighty years, that place had likely remained undiscovered and unopened by anyone.\n\nWhich meant,\n\nThat incomplete body was, very likely, still inside.\n\nIf they excavated on their own initiative and opened that place, reawakening that incomplete body—considering the scene at the end of the dream where that body couldn't even control itself—Zhou Ze felt a chill run down his spine.\n\nThe most crucial thing was,\n\nThat guy, to a certain extent, was himself.\n\nIn the end,\n\nIf something truly unexpected happened, this responsibility would very likely still fall on his head.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was afraid of taking responsibility, but if his past self, going crazy, caused an accident, he would definitely feel uneasy about it.\n\nHis phone rang at this moment. It was Xu Qinglang calling. Zhou Ze answered the call:\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you. That Sister Tang is here. Old Daoist went with her to the police station. He told me earlier that if you woke up, you should call him.\"\n\nTang Shi is there?\n\nZhou Ze was pleasantly surprised.\n\nZhou Ze immediately hung up the phone and, while driving, dialed Old Daoist's number.\n\n\"Hello, Boss, what's up? We're digging here.\"\n\nOld Daoist's side was also very noisy, similar to how it felt when Zhang Yanfeng called him earlier. Clearly, Old Daoist was currently at the construction site.\n\n\"Tell Tang Shi to answer the phone,\" Zhou Ze yelled.\n\n\"Recite poetry?\" Old Daoist covered his other ear. Clearly, the noise was too loud there, and he hadn't heard clearly.\n\nAt this moment, Old Daoist's phone beeped. Immediately after, a woman's voice came through:\n\n\"It's me.\"\n\nIt was likely Tang Shi, upon learning that Zhou Ze was calling, snatched the phone from Old Daoist without a second thought.\n\n\"Don't let them keep digging, there's a problem down there!\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nAfter Tang Shi spoke, she hung up the phone.\n\nZhou Ze was startled for a moment. Did she really hear clearly?\n\nRegardless, Zhou Ze unconsciously accelerated and started driving towards the police station. As for traffic violations, Xu Qinglang would be the one to pay the fines and lose points at the traffic management bureau anyway, since the car was his.\n\nAlong the way, except for a brief traffic jam caused by elementary school students crossing the road for a field trip organized to celebrate Children's Day (June 1st)** near a school entrance, the rest of the time was smooth sailing, with no more traffic jams.\n\nHe parked the car on the road outside the police station. Zhou Ze quickly got out and rushed directly towards the construction site.\n\nThe construction site was now very quiet. Gone was the noise heard during the previous phone calls. Many construction workers were sitting on the ground, daydreaming and chatting.\n\n\"Boss, over here, over here!\"\n\nOld Daoist saw Zhou Ze first and immediately shouted out.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and saw Tang Shi sitting by a clean flowerbed platform ahead.\n\nTang Shi was unwrapping Great White Rabbit milk candies*** and continuously putting them into her mouth. She seemed to have never changed this habit.\n\nIt had been almost half a year. Seeing her again, he found no changes.\n\nTang Shi, chewing on a milk candy, glanced at the hastily arriving Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"I tampered with all the construction machinery, so they broke down.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze let out a long breath. Tang Shi had helped him a great deal this time. No matter what, it was good that nothing had been excavated yet.\n\nThis meant that the most terrifying possibility would temporarily not occur. There was still room for maneuver.\n\n\"Down there, it's probably a concentration camp, right?\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze and asked. She had already analyzed the items excavated earlier.\n\n\"Yes, it's a live human experimentation institute similar to Unit 731,\" Zhou Ze stated directly and frankly.\n\nTang Shi wasn't particularly surprised. She then continued to ask: \"What is the reason you want me to stop them from excavating?\"\n\n\"Why did you come here?\" Zhou Ze didn't rush to answer the previous question.\n\n\"It's because you dreamt of returning to hell while dreaming. Someone saw it. She noticed your anomaly and told him. And he told me to come and see, saying that something might happen to you.\"\n\nWhile Zhou Ze was still endlessly analyzing in his mind who all these 'he's truly referred to,\n\nTang Shi directly tapped Zhou Ze's calf with her sandal-clad leg, urging him:\n\n\"You still haven't answered my previous question.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed,\n\nPointed at the construction site ahead and said:\n\n\"I'm buried down there.\"\n\n\"...Tang Shi.\"\n\n\"...Old Daoist.\"\n\n............\n\n\"Boss, this is really... Heh heh, just this morning I saw a post on Weibo saying an archaeologist was digging a tomb and kept digging until he realized it was his own ancestral grave.\"\n\nOld Daoist said from the side.\n\n\"You believe that joke? I saw that joke years ago,\" Tang Shi said directly.\n\n\"Oh.\" Old Daoist shrugged, then pointed at Zhou Ze, \"You can't say that the boss was just playing with us and telling us a joke, can you?\"\n\nTang Shi said nothing more. Instead, she swept a playful smile across Zhou Ze, \"I really never saw it before, that you have such a big background. Past lives and previous existences aren't something everyone gets; they're usually the exclusive domain of important figures.\n\nOr perhaps, this isn't really a past life at all, but simply a body you've used before?\"\n\nTang Shi simply moved closer to Zhou Ze, reached out and squeezed his shoulder, continuing:\n\n\"If you can change once, why not twice? The last time was an accident, but since it succeeded, it means it could have succeeded before.\"\n\nAt this moment, Zhang Yanfeng saw Zhou Ze and walked towards them.\n\n\"The machines broke down,\" Zhang Yanfeng said directly.\n\n\"Hm.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, after you called me, I went and reported to my superiors. I said that below was very likely a former Japanese human bacterial research institute, and that reckless excavation could lead to leaks of poisonous gases or similar substances, endangering the safety of nearby residents. Now, the higher-ups have decided to suspend construction and excavation, waiting for expert teams from relevant departments in Beijing and Shanghai to come and inspect.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng with some surprise and said: \"You can hold back?\"\n\n\"I am a police officer; I must be responsible for the safety of the public,\" Zhang Yanfeng replied.\n\nPutting himself in Zhang Yanfeng's shoes, if Zhou Ze were Zhang Yanfeng, he probably wouldn't be able to hold back. He would definitely urge people to start digging immediately, regardless of the consequences.\n\nA psychological shadow that had tormented him for twenty years was not something one could just let go of.\n\n\"So, it means, at least until tomorrow, this place will be safe?\" Zhou Ze confirmed again.\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded. \"The expert team won't arrive until tomorrow.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt relieved.\n\nBut soon,\n\nHis expression changed,\n\nBecause with a \"clack,\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng directly took out handcuffs and cuffed one of Zhou Ze's hands, and at the same time, cuffed the other end of the handcuff to one of his own hands. The two were cuffed together with one handcuff.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Zhou Ze said, pointing at the handcuff.\n\n\"I can hold back, and you must hold back too. Don't think I don't know you're definitely planning to find a chance to go down tonight.\n\nI'm sorry, my duty doesn't allow for the slightest accident to happen here. This time, I'm acting against regulations by restricting your personal freedom. Once the expert team arrives tomorrow and takes over this place, you can go to the police station and file a complaint against me; I am willing to accept disciplinary action.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips, forcibly resisting the impulse to snap the handcuffs with his fingernails and let Officer Zhang witness true power,\n\nBecause, thinking about it, what the other party did was truly irreproachable in terms of morality and duty, even quite admirable.\n\nBoss Zhou still decided to subdue with virtue,\n\nAnd said directly:\n\n\"Believe me, I'm very familiar with what's down there.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng let out a \"hehe\" laugh,\n\nClearly disbelieving.\n\n\"I've lived down there for eighty years.\"\n\n---\n*   **long-neglected resentful wife (久曠怨婦)**: A classic literary trope referring to a wife whose husband has been away for a long time, often implying unfulfilled longing or sexual frustration.

    "content": "Night fell.\n\nTwo people sat on a park bench behind the police station.\nOn one side was a man,\nand on the other side was also a man.\n\nZhang Yanfeng took out a cigarette from his pocket, offered one to Zhou Ze, and put one in his own mouth.\nThey had been sitting like this for a long time.\n\nNot far away, Laodao and Tang Shi stood.\n\n\"Dawdling.\"\n\nTang Shi was clearly displeased with Zhou Ze's procrastinating style; according to her habit, simply knocking out the police officer would have settled everything.\n\n\"Old Zhang, trust me this time. The safest way to handle this is for me to go down and take a look first. Even if those experts come tomorrow, it won't be as effective as me going down.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng remained silent, quietly blowing smoke rings.\n\n\"I don't need to lie to you, really.\"\n\n\"Below is a former Japanese military bacteriological research lab. Can you guarantee that going down without authorization won't cause harmful gas leaks?\" Zhang Yanfeng said in a deep voice, \"Do you know how many people live around here?\"\n\n\"I can tell you clearly, if the situation below is the worst-case scenario, once things fester, the damage will be far greater than that caused by a gas leak.\"\n\nThinking of that broken body, which he eventually couldn't even control himself, if he were to wake up again, the consequences would truly be terrifying.\n\n\"You could knock me out.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng threw his cigarette butt on the ground and stomped on it.\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze was startled for a moment.\n\n\"I've been waiting for you to knock me out. Of course, I would resist, because it's my duty, but I believe someone like you... has the ability to knock me out even if I resist. At that point, I wouldn't be able to stop you from doing what you need to do.\"\n\n\"Why are you so stubborn?\" Zhou Ze said, somewhat helplessly.\n\n\"The stubborn one isn't me, it's you.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng pointed a finger at Tang Shi and Laodao, who were still waiting under the streetlamp ahead, and said:\n\n\"That girl, she's killed people, hasn't she?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"I knew it the first time I saw her, *hehe*. I used to be a soldier, then a criminal detective. I've been in this line of work for many years and have seen plenty of extremely vicious people.\nThat girl's eyes, I could tell at a glance, she's killed people, and the kind who don't care about human lives at all.\nIf I didn't believe you, I could have called people to surround her at the police station then and conducted an identity check on her.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, \"You wouldn't find anything.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng looked at Zhou Ze with some surprise.\n\n\"In this world, many things can't be investigated, really. When you arrested me back then, you didn't find anything on me, did you?\nBut I can tell you clearly, in the past year, I've sent who knows how many people to hell.\"\n\n\"Then why are you still willing to sit here with me for so long?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked, somewhat curious.\n\nThe relationship between the two had been constantly changing. At first, Zhou Ze was a suspect and Zhang Yanfeng was the police officer. Then, they were both \"cellmates.\" Now, they were more like friends from different circles, each with a bit of admiration for the other.\n\n\"First, it's not late into the night yet; it's still early.\nSecond, I think you're a good police officer, and I'm willing to waste a little time on you.\"\n\n\"Should I feel honored by that?\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, and Zhang Yanfeng was compelled to stand up with him.\n\n\"I believe there are still more good people in this world. I've met a few good police officers before, the kind who truly adhere to their principles. I respect them, and so I respect you now.\nSo, I hope you won't be so pedantic this time. You can come down with me. You also have iron chains on your feet. If nothing else, perhaps one of your ancestors died down there.\"\n\n\"I've checked. I had a great-uncle who reportedly joined the army during the Anti-Japanese War, but then there was no news of him, and our family couldn't find out anything.\"\n\n\"Come down with me.\"\n\nZhou Ze invited.\n\nZhang Yanfeng pulled out his gun,\npointing it at Zhou Ze's back.\n\n\"I don't know your identity clearly, and honestly, I'm afraid to know. You might think my actions are pedantic and stubborn, but I'm sorry, my past life and work experiences tell me that sometimes, you truly must be stubborn and persistent, without retreating a single step.\"\n\n\"Mm, I respect your...\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nIt wasn't a gunshot,\nbut a stone hitting Zhang Yanfeng's neck.\nZhang Yanfeng fainted onto the bench.\n\nTang Shi walked over, a clear look of impatience on her face.\n\n\"He even told you to knock him out, so why were you still talking nonsense?\nShould I have prepared some tea for you both and brought a DV to record it, so your positive energy dialogue could continue to spread?\"\n\nZhou Ze extended a nail, easily snapping the handcuffs, and sighed, \"There's no reasoning with you. What else can your brain hold besides White Rabbit candy?\"\n\nTang Shi's gaze sharpened, seemingly ready to explode, but she ultimately restrained herself, turned, and walked directly towards the construction site.\n\nLaodao chuckled beside them, thinking that ever since his boss learned to enter a 'Musou' state*, his back had straightened when seeing Miss Tang Shi again, and it was the same with the little loli.\nIndeed, 'men with money don't turn bad, but sows climb trees and become monsters.'*\n\nThe three of them arrived at the construction site. The area had already been sealed off, but it clearly couldn't stop them.\n\n\"Which location?\" Tang Shi said coldly.\n\n\"Right here. Just dig down. Be careful not to make too much noise.\" Zhou Ze pointed to the ground beneath their feet.\n\nSoon,\nthe rocks and timber underfoot began to float on their own, quietly piling up to one side. With the foundation laid by daytime excavation, the rest was quite convenient, and Tang Shi's \"work efficiency\" was truly no slower than large machinery.\n\nBoss Zhou had once thought that if he set up a construction company, the profits would be considerable: Bai Yingying, with her immense strength, as a laborer, and Tang Shi acting as construction machinery. One didn't need to eat, the other didn't need electricity; with virtually no costs, it would all be profit.\n\nAfter a while, a passage wide enough for one person was cleared. Zhou Ze went down first, Tang Shi second, and Laodao third.\n\nThere was no smell of poison gas below, only a musty scent of long-sealed dust.\nFollowing the steps down,\ntaking out a phone to use as a flashlight,\nthe view ahead was still relatively clear.\n\nLaodao, walking at the very back, felt his shoe soles were a bit sticky. He mumbled, \"What's this stuff on the ground?\"\n\n\"Bloodstains,\" Tang Shi replied.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nLaodao dared not utter another sound, sticking close behind the two bigwigs ahead.\n\nPushing open an iron door ahead that was long since corroded and rusted beyond recognition, what met their eyes was a familiar prison corridor, with cells on both sides.\n\nZhou Ze still remembered the scene from his dream where he walked through here with shackles on, and the people in the nearby cells looked at him with envious eyes.\n\nPassing through here again, they shone the flashlight inside, and in the cells as far as the eye could see, there were mummified corpses.\n\nAfter the Japanese blew up the entrance and exit, they likely never intended to reopen it. Later, perhaps due to the war situation or other reasons, even after Japan's defeat, this place was forgotten.\nThe people originally imprisoned in the cells inside were thus trapped and died here.\n\n\"They didn't starve to death.\"\n\nTang Shi, at this moment, directly used her telekinesis to snap two bars, even crouching down to examine a corpse, and said:\n\n\"There must have been a lot of dust when the passage was blown up. These people all died of suffocation, not because you left them to die back then.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath,\n\"I take back what I said earlier about your brain only holding White Rabbit candy.\"\n\n\"What about you? Where are you?\" Tang Shi asked, \"The body you mentioned.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed ahead.\n\n\"Don't delay. If you want to pay respects, wait until tomorrow.\"\n\nSaying this, Tang Shi took the initiative to walk forward.\nAfter passing through a passage ahead, the area immediately opened up, as they had entered the laboratory section.\n\nTang Shi stopped, and Laodao followed, stopping with Tang Shi. Then, Laodao covered his mouth and bent over, his body convulsing, clearly trying to suppress an uncontrollable retch.\n\nZhou Ze was the last to walk over. The scene before him didn't particularly surprise him, as he had personally experienced the most vivid real-time images in his dream.\n\nAnd now,\nin the laboratory area, various gruesomely dead people, various inhumane methods of death, and exaggerated scenes with an artistic, explosive quality, had, after eighty years, become stained with the dust of time, no longer as vivid and shocking as they once were.\nOf course,\nfor those who hadn't seen the initial version,\nthis scene,\nwas already enough to be called a living hell.\n\n\"Most of those who died here were Japanese soldiers and researchers. They deserved their fates.\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"That's true, but Boss, this scene is too R-rated*. I really can't stomach it, Laodao.\"\n\nLaodao wiped the corner of his mouth, his face pale.\n\n\"Clean up your vomit on the ground. Don't let the expert team come down tomorrow and take your specimen back for study.\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze looked at Tang Shi beside him and asked:\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\nTang Shi shook her head.\n\nZhou Ze was somewhat puzzled; logically, her psychological resilience should be higher than Laodao's.\nWhen Zhou Ze took two more steps forward and saw Tang Shi's face, he found that she was actually smiling, and her face showed excitement and admiration.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that the old you had such high taste and style. The scenes here, the corpses, the states of death, including the patterns built up by blood...\nTruly,\nit's beautiful.\"\n\n\"............\" Laodao.\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Clicking sound............\"\n\nA clear snap suddenly came from deep within the laboratory.\nZhou Ze's gaze sharply turned to that location.\nThat laboratory,\nif he remembered correctly,\nwas the area where the safe was located!\n\nTang Shi licked her lips. She seemed a bit nervous, but couldn't hide her excitement, and slowly said:\n\n\"You see,\nhe agrees with me too.\"\n___\n* \"Musou\" state: Refers to a state of overwhelming power, as seen in \"Musou\" (Warriors) video games where a single character can defeat hundreds of enemies.\n* 'Men with money don't turn bad, but sows climb trees and become monsters.': This is a playful reversal of a common Chinese saying \"男人有錢就變壞\" (men turn bad when they get rich) and an idiom \"母豬能上樹\" (a sow can climb a tree, meaning something impossible).

    "content": "Unlike Tang Shi's excitement, Zhou Ze now felt a chill down his spine, because he had witnessed that mutilated body wandering through the institute, depicting art with death.\n\nThat kind of leisurely stroll, that kind of unhurried methodicalness,\n\nit was almost as if it would lay out nine *wen* coins* in front of you and ask how many ways there were to write the character 'death'.\n\nIf others saying \"When I go crazy, even I'm afraid of myself\" was just a casual remark,\n\nthen for Boss Zhou now,\n\nthis was truly the most fitting description.\n\nEven though it was clearly him,\n\nhe harbored an extremely wary emotion towards that one.\n\n\"Actually... you've always overlooked a problem.\"\n\nTang Shi said as she slowly walked forward.\n\n\"What problem?\"\n\n\"That is, the old you was you; the current you is also you. Since the current you is you, then the old you is no longer you.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist, counting the many \"yous\" on the side, honestly didn't understand what Tang Shi meant. At the same time, a question began to form in his mind:\n\nThese dead ones are indeed different from ordinary people,\n\nin such a gloomy and terrifying place,\n\nthey were actually still discussing philosophical questions.\n\nHonestly, the Old Taoist now somewhat regretted following them down. He thought it would have been so much better to stay up top and keep watch. It was already unnerving enough down here, and they were still saying strange things.\n\nZhou Ze, however, understood. Tang Shi meant that the scenes he saw in his dream were of his past self killing.\n\nThen,\n\neighty years later,\n\nhe had become Zhou Ze, having lost much of his memory and only remembering that he was Zhou Ze. But the soul had been passed down, which was also why he could turn into a zombie.\n\nTherefore,\n\nhe and that mutilated body could not appear in the same era. Even if the other party was here now, it was only a mere body.\n\nBecause the soul of that mutilated figure who had slaughtered everywhere and created death art eighty years ago had already become his current soul.\n\nSo,\n\nwith only an empty shell left here, the level of threat was certainly not as great as before.\n\n\"Aren't you even a little concerned about your past? Anyway, I haven't sensed how eager you are to know your true identity or your past.\"\n\nTang Shi asked, stepping around a desiccated corpse at her feet.\n\n\"I only remember that I am me, I am Zhou Ze. I think this is pretty good,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Heh, your mindset is really good.\"\n\n\"There are quite a few stories in my bookstore where the protagonist endures a long, bitter journey just to uncover the mystery of their origins and find forgotten truths. But how tiring is that?\"\n\n\"Very true.\" Tang Shi nodded.\n\n\"Actually, the most crucial thing is, if I were to find my old self again, I'm afraid I wouldn't be the current me anymore. For the current me, that would almost be like being 'killed'.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist, listening from behind, was truly utterly confused.\n\nDamn it,\n\nthese two are really addicted to chatting, aren't they,\n\nand so profoundly at that.\n\nFinally, they reached the entrance of the laboratory. The laboratory door was closed.\n\n\"In the end, he ran back into the safe himself?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe decayed door slowly opened, emitting an ear-splitting creaking sound that continuously reverberated through the institute. Echoes even appeared in some distant corners, as if dead souls were still wailing.\n\n\"Miss Tang, can we just honestly use our hands to open the door this time? When you open doors like that, this humble Taoist always feels uneasy.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist grumbled softly from the side.\n\nTang Shi looked at the Old Taoist and shrugged.\n\n\"If I told you I didn't use psychokinesis just now, would you feel even more uneasy?\"\n\n\"............\" The Old Taoist.\n\nTang Shi didn't rush in. Instead, she scanned her surroundings again. She always felt as if something was hidden in a dark spot, watching them.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, it seems we've always overlooked a most fundamental problem. Sorry, it's just that I haven't dealt with complex matters like yours before, so I kept overlooking it and didn't remember.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That is, since the current you is here, and you are Zhou Ze. Doesn't that mean something must have happened to the one who stayed here during these eighty years? Otherwise, where did you come from?\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nNo sooner had Tang Shi's words fallen than a muffled thud came from inside the laboratory.\n\nTang Shi's gaze hardened. She couldn't care less about continuing to discuss the previous problem with Zhou Ze and walked directly into the laboratory.\n\nThe safe door was already closed, with stirred-up dust around it. On top of the safe was a hole about the size of a human face.\n\nBelow it, there was a desiccated corpse, with only white bones remaining. The skull's bones were whiter than the rest of the body, feeling as if they had just had their teeth cleaned.\n\nThe Old Taoist hid behind Zhou Ze, clutching the talisman paper in his hand, but his eyes kept wandering over the desiccated corpse as he asked Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Boss, we can take that skull back. It's like a work of art.\"\n\n\"If you want to take it, you take it back.\" Zhou Ze had no particular thoughts on this.\n\nTang Shi glanced at Zhou Ze, signaling that she was about to open the safe.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, shifting his body slightly to the side, preparing to provide support no matter what happened.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak...\"\n\nA slight friction sound came from the safe, as if something inside was pulling at the door, preventing Tang Shi from opening it with psychokinesis.\n\nTang Shi frowned slightly and increased her force.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nA loud bang was heard, and the entire safe flew up. Yes, it flew up.\n\nZhou Ze immediately pushed the Old Taoist away, and then moved aside himself, thus avoiding being struck by the safe.\n\n\"Hiss hiss hiss hiss hiss hiss hiss...\"\n\nThe safe door opened by itself, and huge rats suddenly scurried out from inside. Each of these rats was as big as a kitten's body, and their eyeballs glowed with an eerie dark light. After emerging, they weren't afraid of people. Instead, they gathered in front of them, as if ready to launch an attack at any moment.\n\nBelow the original location of the safe, a large hole had appeared. This hole was sunken in, and white smoke still lingered there.\n\nTwo pieces of glass on the ground were controlled by Tang Shi and swept directly towards these large rats. For a moment, blood and flesh flew everywhere, and the rats suffered heavy casualties. The remaining ones immediately scurried back into the hole in fear.\n\n\"What happened just now?\" Zhou Ze asked Tang Shi, glancing at the rat corpse fragments on the ground.\n\n\"Something below was wrestling with me.\"\n\nTang Shi didn't rush towards the hole. Instead, she looked at the surrounding walls.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, I think the problem now isn't as simple as just dealing with the body you left behind. There truly are other things here.\"\n\nNo sooner had Tang Shi's words fallen than the laboratory walls suddenly began to crack. Tentacle-like things abruptly swept across, making a whistling sound in the air, carrying an extremely strong force!\n\nTang Shi spread her hands apart, and psychokinesis formed an invisible wall, blocking most of the tentacles.\n\nOne tentacle threaded through from another direction. Just as it was about to touch Tang Shi, Zhou Ze directly grasped it and then cut it open with his fingernails. Immediately, a pool of foul-smelling liquid appeared on Zhou Ze's palm.\n\nIt was at this moment that rustling sounds also came from other parts of the institute, as if countless vines were extending towards them.\n\n\"Crack crack crack...\"\n\nNearby glass was also shattered, and those vines quickly blocked all exits and gaps in the laboratory. They didn't attack; instead, they began to secrete a viscous, milky-white liquid. This white liquid had an extremely strong corrosive odor, and when it dripped onto the ground, it felt as if sulfuric acid had been splashed out.\n\n\"Damn it, what the hell is this thing?\" The Old Taoist was so scared his body began to tremble.\n\nThis scene was like they had walked into the belly of a carnivorous plant, and now it was preparing to digest them.\n\n\"It's trying to drive us into that hole,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing to where the rats had scurried back into earlier.\n\n\"You put on quite the airs. We've come all this way, and you don't proactively come out to meet us? Do you expect us to go in and pay homage to you?\"\n\nTang Shi closed her eyes, and then slowly opened them again. In the depths of her eyes, a purple light flickered. Her entire body seemed to float up, though not high, only a few centimeters.\n\nThen, the wind rose. In an instant, all the white liquid surging across the ground also floated up, reversing its flow and splashing back onto the tentacles.\n\nThe liquid, which had clearly been secreted from those very tentacles before, now inflicted equal damage upon them. In an instant, the dense, numerous tentacles began to violently twist and melt, then rapidly retreated. The air was permeated with the rich smell of roasted gluten.\n\nTang Shi closed her eyes again, took a deep breath, and her body swayed slightly, but she still forced herself to hold on. She had just overdrawn herself.\n\n\"Crunch crunch... Crunch crunch...\"\n\nA clear friction sound began to emanate from beneath the hole, as if something was moving towards them.\n\nThat *thing* had arrived.\n\nA shadow slowly rose from beneath the hole, resembling a human face.\n\nThe Old Taoist took out his phone's flashlight and shone it towards it, his eyes immediately widening.\n\nAt the hole, what was revealed was half a human face. The other half appeared to have been cut away with extreme smoothness, and it carried an eerie luster.\n***\n*   **Nine *wen* coins:** In ancient China, a *wen* was a unit of currency, usually a copper coin with a hole in the middle. Here, \"laying out nine *wen* coins\" is an idiom, often implying a challenge or a test of one's knowledge, as if someone is setting a problem for another to solve. It suggests a methodical, almost academic, approach to something as terrifying as death.",

    "content": "Half a face, very abruptly, rose from the direction of the cave, and the surrounding temperature also began to rapidly drop.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously gasped, his most worried situation had still appeared.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had thought before that since he was Zhou Ze now, regardless of soul or memory, at least it proved that from eighty years ago until now, the original \"himself\" that was locked in the research institute and used as a research subject by the Japanese had moved, otherwise, he wouldn't exist.\n\nSo, did that mean this body might not be here?\n\nBut Zhou Ze had still guessed wrong,\n\nThis body was still here,\n\nAnd had undergone a special transformation.\n\nTang Shi had said there was a demon here before,\n\nZhou Ze, anyway, hadn't felt anything at all.\n\nHowever,\n\nA man's shadow, a tree's name*, having seen the scene of this ruined body massacring in his dream before, and having personally witnessed its own uncontrollable madness, facing it again now, Zhou Ze still felt somewhat uneasy in his heart.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nA ripple spread out,\n\nThe sole eye remaining on that half-face opened; within its gaze, there was still the familiar emptiness, as if there were no eyeballs at all, but in the next moment, clumps of straw-like roots shot out from within the eye, and gradually extended outwards, even completing the outline of the lost right half of the face, making the face appear \"complete,\" but in reality, it looked even more bizarre and incongruous.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA skeletal hand reached out from the edge, and after gripping the ground, its body also began to slowly climb upwards.\n\nIts movements were very slow, appearing somewhat sluggish, like a puppet being manipulated by a clumsy apprentice artisan, and it also seemed possible to discern its difficulty.\n\nBut that aura was like something innate, even though its body was ruined, even though the soul that was originally within it had undergone who-knows-what and finally ended up with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nHe crawled out of the cave, but in an instant, his body began to retreat uncontrollably, as if some invisible force was suppressing him.\n\nA trail of sparks began to appear on the ground, enough to show the intensity of the friction.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nHe opened his mouth, with only half a mouth opening in an extremely exaggerated and terrifying manner, the other half of the face, woven from grass stalks, instantly collapsed and fell apart; he was making a silent roar, clearly enraged by the situation.\n\n\"Plop...\"\n\nZhou Ze and Tang Shi didn't react at all; they just watched as this ruined body, which had just barely crawled out, knelt back onto the ground, and was then forcibly dragged back into the cave.\n\nThe entire scene and process looked somewhat comical, a cool, grand entrance, and then inexplicably dragged down, like an actor whose curtain fell just as they came on stage, before even speaking.\n\nHowever, this situation also greatly dissipated the pressure on Zhou Ze and the others, and much of the accumulated solemnity in their hearts was dispelled.\n\n\"Boss, is that the old you?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"It looks like there's something wrong with this body, huh,\" \"grass is really growing on its head**.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to respond to him, but he didn't expect the Old Taoist to get addicted to talking to himself, and continued:\n\n\"Boss, I feel like your luck is truly terrible; your own grave keeps getting robbed; first, your last life's corpse was ground to dust and scattered, and eaten as black sesame paste.\n\n\"Then this body, was again planted like a potted plant, tsk tsk, Boss, my profession is choosing grave sites for people; next time you plan to die, find me, this humble Taoist, I'll definitely pick a safe one for you...\"\n\nThe Old Taoist spoke with increasing excitement, but when he saw Zhou Ze's gaze, his voice slowly trailed off.\n\n\"Go up front and take a look, what exactly is down there.\" Zhou Ze said to the Old Taoist.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist was startled.\n\n\"Holy crap,\"\n\n\"I'm just a bystander***, responsible for looting the bag on the side and shouting '6666'***,\"\n\n\"You want me to go up front and look?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist looked towards Tang Shi, hoping Miss Tang would reject the boss's order, which clearly harbored a personal vendetta.\n\nBut to his surprise, Tang Shi just nodded, and echoed:\n\n\"That's fine too.\"\n\n\"............\" The Old Taoist.\n\nThe Old Taoist had no choice, and could only brace himself and slowly walk forward.\n\n\"No need to worry too much,\" \"that thing just now was clearly restricted here, so for eighty years, it clearly underwent a mutation, and was even taken over by something, like a cuckoo in a magpie's nest****, but it still can't leave this place.\n\n\"Both your boss and I are 'ghosts'; you're a living person, you won't provoke anything that might be down there.\"\n\nHearing this, the Old Taoist felt much more at ease; after getting closer, he shone his flashlight downwards, and then quickly peeked his head in for a glance.\n\n\"Boss, it looks like a well down there, and there's water.\" The Old Taoist called out.\n\nZhou Ze and Tang Shi then approached, and sure enough, it wasn't a cave down there, but a well.\n\n\"What do we do now, who knows how your soul got out back then?\" Tang Shi squatted beside it, helplessly tidying her hair, \"Or, let's just leave; wait for the expert team to come down tomorrow, and once they find this place, let them figure out a way to bomb him, he can't escape anyway.\"\n\n\"Do you think they'll bomb him?\" Zhou Ze retorted, \"if they discover this body.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"A body that's clearly dead but can still move, this transcends borders, transcends consciousness; they definitely won't be able to resist taking it back as a research subject.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that be great then, you could make your own contribution to modern medicine.\" Tang Shi said with an indifferent expression.\n\n\"You're very beautiful.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"But do you know how many young men, because they have no money or no opportunity, have no place to vent the physiological needs they accumulate every day? Why don't you go help them?\"\n\nA purple light flashed in Tang Shi's eyes, clearly, she was angry.\n\nShe remembered the old Zhou Ze wasn't like this,\n\nIndeed,\n\nPeople change.\n\nEspecially when you find that your strength no longer requires you to bow and scrape before the person in front of you, this is human nature, and those who were previously in a high position are often the ones who are most unaccustomed to it.\n\n\"Hey, hey, hey, you two, stop arguing, stop arguing, the water below is starting to boil.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist pointed downwards and said; he knew Tang Shi's personality, and also understood his boss's anger after his body was stolen once; now that he found his body had problems again, it must be hard to accept.\n\nThe water in the well began to \"gurgle gurgle\" and boil,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nThe water level began to rise rapidly, like underground spring water starting to gush out.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nThe water level even surpassed the cave opening, and began to spread outwards; this pace and speed was more terrifying than a bursting fire hydrant.\n\nRats were once again swept up, followed closely by many things like grass stalks and tree branches.\n\nThe water's gushing speed became faster and faster, it even sounded like something below cried out, and the water flow speed increased several times over.\n\nIn an instant, the water level in the research institute had reached waist height.\n\nTang Shi's body subconsciously retreated, wanting the surrounding water currents to be further away from her, but in the next moment, a hand suddenly grabbed her ankle underwater.\n\n\"Swish!\"\n\nTwo glass shards instantly cut into the water, but they only saw the water below churn wildly, and Tang Shi was dragged, flipped head over heels, into the water.\n\nAfter entering the water, Tang Shi then saw that the ruined body, which had just crawled out and been dragged back, had actually silently crawled out again.\n\nIcy pain and coldness at her ankle, the surrounding water currents, under her mental control, frantically attacked that body, but the opponent was like a massive steel plate, unmoving!\n\n\"Plop!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze plunged into the water, directly pouncing on that ruined body, his ten fingernails mercilessly piercing into the opponent's skull, showing no mercy at all just because it was his former body.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nThe ruined body opened its mouth, released Tang Shi's ankle, and then tightly gripped Zhou Ze's neck with both hands; the two of them surprisingly tangled and fought together.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nSounds began to come from beneath the water again; meanwhile, the Old Taoist was standing on the office desk, his head almost touching the ceiling; seeing Tang Shi surface, he immediately reached out and pulled her over.\n\n\"Where's the boss? Where's the boss?\"\n\nTang Shi's face was grim, and she didn't care to look at her still-bleeding ankle; she directly put both hands underwater, and then let out a fierce shout.\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\n\nThe water surface, which had almost filled the laboratory, was suddenly split apart, revealing the figures of Zhou Ze and the ruined body.\n\nThe ruined body continuously tugged at Zhou Ze, but Zhou Ze's ten fingernails were firmly embedded in the opponent's skull.\n\nHowever, it was clearly visible that the ruined body's target was not Zhou Ze at all; it was still steadily moving in one direction, towards Tang Shi's location.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nIn the midst of the unknown,\n\nTang Shi had a premonition,\n\nThat what that thing wanted was not Zhou Ze, who had countless connections to it, but herself!\n\nWhat exactly was going on?\n\n\"Gurgle gurgle... gurgle gurgle...\"\n\nThe water began to swirl rapidly; the water surface that had previously covered the entire laboratory began to rapidly recede, just like a bathtub full of water having its plug pulled.\n\nThe massive vortex itself carried a natural suction force, plus, after losing the protection and concealment of the water, the ruined body, which had once again crawled out of the cave, again felt that terrifying force of repulsion and confinement; his body began to slide backward rapidly, filled with extreme unwillingness, until it fell back into the cave.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, whom he had been gripping tightly,\n\nThis time also could not escape,\n\nOnly heard the sound of a stone dropping into water,\n\nZhou Ze and the ruined body fell into the well together.\n\nAll around was completely calm,\n\nNot even a drop of water stain was left on the ground,\n\nIt was still dry.\n\n---\n*   A man's shadow, a tree's name: An idiom meaning a person's reputation precedes them, or that their fame/notoriety is well-known.\n**  Grass is really growing on its head: A sarcastic remark implying the body has been neglected or is decaying, akin to a neglected grave.\n*** I'm just a bystander, responsible for looting the bag on the side and shouting '6666': The phrase \"just a bystander\" (打酱油的) is an idiom for someone who is merely watching and not participating. \"Looting the bag\" (舔包) and \"shouting '6666'\" (喊6666) are gamer slang, meaning to pick up loot after others have done the fighting and then cheer them on (6666 is internet slang for \"awesome\" or \"great\").\n**** Like a cuckoo in a magpie's nest: An idiom meaning someone takes over another's property or position, often by force or trickery.",

    "content": "「Bubbles... bubbles...」\n\nZhou Ze remembered sinking into water several times before, but those times were either in hell or in dreams, especially when he passed by that pool where he encountered the Faceless Woman.\n\nBut this time was different; the feeling of suffocation and crisis was so intense. From the moment he was dragged down, he knew his life had entered a countdown.\n\nHe didn't regret running to save Tang Shi, even though they had just argued. Old Boss Zhou also couldn't stand Tang Shi's shrewish temper, as if in this world, besides that \"blind man,\" she looked down on all other men.\n\nBut no matter what, Tang Shi had specially come from Shanghai to help him this time, and it would have been too unkind if he had just sat on the sidelines then.\n\nHe hadn't thought much about it at the time, just like when he was in the burning movie theater back then, he hadn't thought much and just ran straight into the flames to save people.\n\nMost importantly, although Tang Shi sometimes appeared very strong, her body was a major weakness. Once someone got close to her, she had few options, whereas he at least had a fighting chance.\n\n「Bubbles... bubbles...」\n\nBubbles constantly emerged from his mouth and nose, and the air in his lungs began to dwindle.\n\nBut the incomplete body, with only half a face remaining, still gripped him tightly. Vines formed from grass stems constantly intertwined and wove together, completing the other half of the face.\n\nThe original left side of the face remained calm, but the green right side was distinctly ferocious, as if brimming with monstrous resentment, not like a person at all, but more like a different manifestation of consciousness.\n\nThe other party seemed to hate him intensely, hating that he hadn't let it capture Tang Shi?\n\nAnd what was its purpose in wanting to drag Tang Shi down?\n\n「Plop...」\n\nThe other party pressed him further down. It wasn't actually that deep; from the cave opening to the bottom was only a dozen meters. But below, Zhou Ze saw an old tree root coiled there. The root wasn't as large as he imagined; on the contrary, it appeared quite \"slender\" yet exceptionally delicate, with an androgynous face twisting ceaselessly in its center.\n\nOn this face, Zhou Ze saw it filled with resentment.\n\nThis feeling was hard to describe, like a robust young man giving him a large dose of potent aphrodisiacs, tying up his hands and feet, and then forcing him to watch adult films; every second was intense torment, not to mention this fellow had probably been tormented for many years.\n\n「Bang!」\n\nZhou Ze was pressed down beside the tree root. The face on the root looked at Zhou Ze. At first, that face showed anger and disdain, but slowly, new emotions appeared on it.\n\nShock,\nFear,\nDread,\nThen confusion,\nFinally,\nIt turned into wild joy!\n\nSichuan Opera Face-Changing is famous worldwide, but the tree root's expression was even more vivid than face-changing.\n\n「It's... you...」\n\nA voice actually came from inside the tree root. Heaven knew how this sound traveled underwater, but Zhou Ze could hear it, though it was a little unclear and muffled.\n\n\"You recognized me?\"\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nThen Zhou Ze felt a little embarrassed,\n\nIndeed, he was embarrassed,\n\nYou see,\n\nThe other party had already recognized him,\n\nBut he himself still didn't recognize himself.\n\n「Whirring... whirring...」\n\nThe tree root's vines began to tremble excitedly. Clearly, it hadn't recognized Zhou Ze at first, which was why it chose to grab Tang Shi. As for its purpose in grabbing Tang Shi, Zhou Ze seemed to be able to guess some of it now: It wanted to relocate!\n\nIt was trapped here,\n\nEven though its vines had managed to control that soulless, incomplete body, it didn't know why it was also firmly pinned down here. Its purpose in grabbing Tang Shi was likely that by controlling Tang Shi, it would have a chance to escape its predicament.\n\nBut now Zhou Ze could sense that the tree root had somewhat lost its mind. In most film and literary works, tree spirits appear calm and wise, usually presenting themselves as old grandfathers. However, the one before Zhou Ze was acting as if it were high on drugs, breakdancing.\n\n「You... die...」\n\nThe voice came again,\n\nCarrying a sinister and venomous hatred!\n\nAt the same time, the incomplete body began to tear at his body even more furiously. This time, it was serious!\n\nAn intense sense of crisis assailed him,\n\nPreviously, the other party might have been trying to save effort, dragging him underwater to drown him and let him fend for himself,\n\nBut now, the other party wanted to kill him with its own hands, to experience the pleasure of revenge.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze, he had actually been waiting and observing before, because Old Boss Zhou truly didn't want to enter his zombie state unless it was absolutely necessary. That meant he would have to be bedridden for half a month after returning.\n\nBut this time, there was no choice. Looking at the guy practically pressed against his face, Zhou Ze opened his mouth, and two fangs rapidly grew out. At the same time, his body began to rapidly dehydrate, shriveling up. The depths of his eyes were covered in green light, and his demeanor completely changed, becoming frenzied and uninhibited!\n\n「Roar!」\n\n「Roar!」\n\nBoth of them opened their mouths and roared, like provoked tigers asserting their own dominance!\n\nIf the scene were frozen here and observed closely, you might even find a great similarity in their expressions as they roared.\n\n「Boom! Boom! Boom!!!!!!!!!!!」\n\nA series of terrifying blows came from below,\n\nZhou Ze was like a ravenous wolf gone mad, desperately tearing at the incomplete yet incredibly resilient body before him. It was clear that Zhou Ze held the absolute advantage.\n\nAfter all,\n\nThe incomplete body before him was no longer the one who had wreaked havoc eighty years ago. It was merely a former shell, a cracked shell, while Zhou Ze possessed its former inner core!\n\nThe incomplete body was kicked away. All around, countless vines suddenly swept over, as thin as hair, beginning to entwine around Zhou Ze's body.\n\n「Bang!」\n\nZhou Ze's body trembled,\n\nAnd the tree root also trembled,\n\nBut it still managed to restrain Zhou Ze.\n\nThe incomplete body that Zhou Ze had just kicked flying charged back again, opening its mouth and directly biting into Zhou Ze's neck area. It clung to Zhou Ze's body, incredibly frenzied.\n\n「You... die...」\n\nThe tree root trembled with excitement.\n\nThis scene excited it even more than escaping its own predicament. In fact, it was willing to exchange its own freedom to utterly destroy that person's soul!\n\nThis person,\n\nHad deceived it back then,\n\nCausing it to miss its chance to take human form, leaving it trapped and locked here, confined to this small area.\n\nThis hatred,\n\nWas higher than the sky and deeper than the sea!\n\n「Fate... retribution...」\n\nThe other party grinned sinisterly.\n\nZhou Ze's body trembled ceaselessly, as if trying to resist, but the thin vines all over him were like the most terrifying iron chains in this world, tightly binding Zhou Ze's entire body.\n\nThe tree root, using its own power,\n\nWas controlling Zhou Ze, suppressing Zhou Ze.\n\nThis was the first time Zhou Ze had encountered being suppressed since he could activate \"Musou\"<sup>1</sup>. One should know that before, he was always unstoppable, killing gods and Buddhas alike, succeeding in everything.\n\nOf course, the current Zhou Ze had completely lost the ability to think; in his mind, only the emotion called \"madness\" remained.\n\nThis standoff lasted for about ten minutes;\n\nThe tree root began to weaken; clearly, it too was exhausted. But the weakening of Zhou Ze's aura was even more pronounced.\n\nLast time, on General Mountain, his physical body had almost collapsed due to being in the zombie state for too long. Because of this, Zhou Ze's time in the zombie state was very short, simply unsustainable for long.\n\nZhou Ze's neck muscles, which had originally been completely tensed, now relaxed. The incomplete body's fangs directly tore a piece of flesh from Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n「Pfft...」\n\nBlood began to spread,\n\nA large hole split open in Zhou Ze's neck, and his head was barely connected to his neck by only a bit of skin and flesh.\n\nThe green light in his eyes slowly dimmed,\n\nAnd the strength of his resistance on his body was also increasingly fading.\n\nThe tree root became even more excited. It even made the incomplete body leave Zhou Ze, instead using its dense, numerous vines to entwine Zhou Ze's body.\n\nIt couldn't move,\n\nBut it wanted to savor its enemy's final moments!\n\nThis was its happiest moment in sixty years!\n\nBesides the wound on his neck, blood also began to seep from other parts of Zhou Ze's body. Every time he entered the zombie state, his body would crack from being unable to withstand the pressure, his skin and flesh tearing open.\n\nThis time,\n\nWas no exception.\n\n「Hehe... retribution... fate... divine punishment...」\n\nThe tree root could only utter two words at a time. At this moment, it continuously vented its inner rage and gloated.\n\nWhat a wonderful thing,\n\nThe culprit who had tricked it sixty years ago, causing it to be locked and confined here, unable to move an inch ever since,\n\nHad unexpectedly delivered himself right to its doorstep sixty years later,\n\nAnd had become so weak!\n\nThis was heaven's will,\n\nThis was heaven opening its eyes!\n\nAs a demonic creature that once had a chance to take human form, it had been tricked so terribly by that guy.\n\nThe incomplete body floated to one side, motionless. Its former body was now controlled by the tree root, becoming its most loyal puppet and enforcer.\n\n「Retribution... fate... one... sixty years...」\n\nThe tree root watched Zhou Ze floating before it, his vital signs growing weaker and weaker, and ceaselessly waved its vines, celebrating joyously.\n\nIt wanted to watch him quietly,\n\nWatch him up close,\n\nWatch him die,\n\nWatch him die completely!\n\nHowever,\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze's eyes, which had already dimmed, suddenly burst forth with a dazzling green light.\n\nEarlier,\n\nZhou Ze's neck had been bitten off a large piece of flesh by the incomplete body, leaving only a bit of skin and flesh connecting his head to his neck. But at this moment, this allowed him to smoothly swing his head almost two to three hundred degrees, directly smashing into the tree root's face.\n\nTwo fangs pierced precisely and viciously into it,\n\nTearing off the tree root's outer skin,\n\nAnd opening his mouth,\n\nHe swallowed the glowing green fruit inside into his mouth, slowly chewing it,\n\n「Crunch... crunch...」\n\nIt was very crunchy!\n\nThe tree root's body began to convulse,\n\nIt couldn't believe everything that was happening before its eyes.\n\n「I've waited for you... sixty years... you're finally... ripe...」\n\nZhou Ze slowly said in a hoarse voice, while chewing the contents in his mouth:\n\n「Also...\n\nIt's been sixty years...\n\nYou're still so...\n\nEasy to trick.」\n***\n<sup>1</sup> 'Musou' (無雙): A term originating from the *Dynasty Warriors* video game series, referring to a character's ultimate, overwhelmingly powerful attack or a state of temporary invincibility.

    "content": "我種下一顆種子，\n\n  終於長出了果實，\n\n  今天是個偉大日子……\n\nAt this moment, the fruit had already been chewed up, transforming into a greenish smoke, slowly wafting out from Zhou Ze's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then enveloping his torso downwards.\n\nZhou Ze's neck had been almost severed earlier, but he was still eating the fruit; evidently, he knew this fruit did not need to be digested directly through the esophagus.\n\nAnd after losing this fruit, which had originally been hidden deep within it, the tree root slowly began to wither, carrying intense unwillingness, carrying an indescribable hatred.\n\nIt never dreamed that at the very end, it would actually be such an outcome.\n\nDivine retribution,\n\nRevenge,\n\nKarma,\n\nAll ultimately turned into a pile of crap, at least, for it, this was indeed the case.\n\nHowever,\n\nJust then,\n\nThat incomplete body suddenly trembled again, and directly charged towards Zhou Ze. The old tree root, with its last bit of life essence, transformed into a raging flame of vengeance. No matter what, it wanted Zhou Ze dead!\n\nOnly,\n\nThe incomplete body suddenly stopped just as it approached Zhou Ze,\n\nNot only did it stop,\n\nBut it also actively reached out and supported Zhou Ze's head, which was about to fall off earlier, allowing the green light to surround it there.\n\n“This body… you thought… it was… left for… you?”\n\nZhou Ze's voice carried a hint of mockery, as if it were a game of Go, where he had already gained the upper hand, and when his opponent was powerless to turn the tide, commenting a few more times, it had a unique flavor.\n\n“He… is the… gardener… I left behind.”\n\nThe incomplete body actively reached out, and directly tore off the grass stalks on the other half of its face; the entire movement was very stiff. And then it even probed its fingers into its own eye sockets, forcibly pulling out all the grass from within.\n\nAlthough what was pulled out were grass stalks, this visual was no less than tearing one's own flesh and blood alive.\n\nIt had completely turned the tables.\n\nThe green in Zhou Ze's eyes was slowly dimming, while his neck was regenerating flesh and blood at a visibly rapid pace.\n\n“Hmm?”\n\nA soft questioning sound came from Zhou Ze,\n\n“You… are resisting me?”\n\nIt seemed like self-talk, and in fact, it truly was self-talk.\n\n“Without me… you would have died long ago… countless times over…”\n\nThe tone was identical to when it faced the tree root earlier.\n\nSuddenly, the green in Zhou Ze's eyes began to flicker incessantly, at times clear, at times doubtful, at times angry, and at times appearing very bewildered.\n\n“You are… the sentience born from me… but you… must understand… you are also… a part of me!”\n\n“Buzz!”\n\nZhou Ze's body began to tremble,\n\nThis internal resistance carried an unyielding defiance.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nThe green light in Zhou Ze's eye sockets began to dissipate, and then, his body slowly began to float upwards.\n\nMeanwhile, the incomplete body silently submerged into the water, taking the decaying, withered old tree root with it, slowly diving downwards.\n\nAlthough the water depth was clearly not astonishing, at this moment, it seemed to have transformed into a terrifying abyss, swallowing both of them, with no knowing where they would ultimately descend.\n\nThe human world has its rules; any existence that does not belong to the human world will be suppressed and obliterated. Ordinary people have their own life paths, and anyone who dares to covet things they are not meant to touch will inevitably suffer punishment.\n\nEighty years ago,\n\nThe almost deranged Japanese found this incomplete body, transported it here, attempting to gain power beyond the limits of human thought. The ultimate result was the corpse going mad, turning this place into a living hell.\n\nIn the unseen world,\n\nAs if a hand,\n\nFrom behind the scenes,\n\nWas adjusting and correcting everything,\n\nIt values one thing:\n\nClear distinctions.\n\n………………\n\n“Gurgle… gurgle… gurgle…”\n\nWater,\n\nMore water,\n\nThis damned water again,\n\nZhou Ze currently hated water, hated it very, very much. He was sick of the sound of liquid filling his ear canals, and detested the suffocating sensation when his lungs were compressed.\n\nSlowly,\n\nHe opened his eyes.\n\nHe saw himself lying in a fish tank, with Bai Yingying, dressed in a swimsuit, wiping and scrubbing his body.\n\nMoreover,\n\nBai Yingying had her back to him, wiping and massaging his thigh area in the hot water.\n\nAnyone with a bit of medical knowledge knew that if a person lay in bed for too long, they could easily develop bedsores, and even other physical ailments.\n\nWhether there were filial children at a long-term sickbed, could be seen by whether the patient in bed had bedsores.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to move,\n\nAn extremely clear and intense stinging sensation suddenly spread throughout his body. This stinging sensation did not come from his skin or flesh, but from his nerves.\n\n“Plop…”\n\nWith a tremble of his body,\n\nZhou Ze slid directly into the bathtub,\n\nDragging Bai Yingying, who was on tiptoes wiping Zhou Ze's body, down with him.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nZhou Ze only felt two plump, extremely soft things pressing against his face, and in the middle, there was the chilling sensation like eating ice cream on a hot summer day.<sup>1</sup>\n\nEven in the hot water,\n\nThis chill was still somewhat unbearable,\n\nEspecially for a patient like Zhou Ze, whose body was extremely fragile, even on the verge of falling apart. This impact was like someone smashing a brick-sized piece of ice onto his face.\n\n“Gurgle…”\n\nZhou Ze instantly fell unconscious again.\n\n“Ah, Boss!”\n\nBai Yingying let out a shriek, and immediately got up, pulling Zhou Ze's face out of the water again.\n\nShe reached out worriedly and touched Zhou Ze's face, and after judging his breath to be normal, Bai Yingying finally let out a long breath, relieved.\n\nIf her own boss was truly,\n\nLooking utterly baffled,\n\nThen suffocated to death by her,\n\nThat would be one hell of a joke.\n\n………………\n\nWhen he woke up for the second time, it was two days later. Upon waking, Zhou Ze found himself lying on… uh, where am I lying?\n\nBelow him was not a bed,\n\nBut the clothesline pole by the window sill.\n\nHis entire body was actually floating in the air!\n\nWas this another dream?\n\nThen I might as well keep sleeping.\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\nAfter about a few minutes,\n\nZhou Ze tried to open his eyes again.\n\nWhy was he still in this dream?\n\nFloating by the window sill, the sun shining on him.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze turned his head, and saw Tang Shi sitting by the window edge, reading a book.\n\n“What's going on?”\n\nTang Shi looked up at Zhou Ze, then picked up the coffee cup next to her and took a sip.\n\nWithout thinking,\n\nZhou Ze knew this woman was definitely drinking the expensive Kopi Luwak he had specifically bought!\n\nThere's plenty of Nestlé instant coffee in the shop, go drink that!\n\n“For patients, getting some sun seems to be good for them. You're a doctor, you should know this principle.”\n\n“Then you could put me in a wheelchair and push me out to sunbathe.”\n\nZhou Ze was somewhat amused,\n\nTo be suspended by psychic power,\n\nHung on the balcony to sunbathe like clothes,\n\nHow shameful.\n\n“A wheelchair? Old Taoist does have a wheelchair, the kind that can go 'toot-toot-toot' by itself with a button press. I figured you wouldn't like it, so I didn't make you sit in that one.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nZhou Ze was genuinely grateful for this.\n\nOld Taoist's wheelchair was still around?\n\nJust imagine,\n\nIf one day Old Taoist or Xu Qinglang took out their phones to show him a video, with him sitting in an electric wheelchair in the video, and nursery rhymes playing 'toot-toot-toot' next to him, that would simply be the darkest of dark histories.\n\n“Now, put me down.”\n\nTang Shi nodded, and Zhou Ze was moved from the window sill to the bed.\n\n“You're awake, are you alright?” Tang Shi asked. “You were unconscious for twenty days this time, quite a long while.”\n\n“Why didn't you go back to Shanghai?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\nEverything's resolved, why are you still here?\n\nIt's fine that you're staying here,\n\nI know you won't help greet customers or make money,\n\nNot stabbing customers to death with a fountain pen is already a huge contribution from you,\n\nAnd you're staying here, drinking my Kopi Luwak???\n\nTang Shi didn't answer the question. Her personality was just like that. Clearly, it was because Zhou Ze had somewhat saved her that night in the research institute, and she felt she should stay here and wait for Zhou Ze to wake up, otherwise, she would feel a bit bad, but wanting her to say it out loud was difficult.\n\n“Do you want me to call Bai Yingying?” Tang Shi asked.\n\n“Not yet, there's something I want to ask you,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“I feel like there's something existing inside my body.”\n\n“I can tell. It's like Ultraman transforming.” Tang Shi took another sip of coffee,\n\n“That night, you fell down, and then you floated back up.\n\nAnd then, the problem was solved.”\n\nZhou Ze's heart was bleeding.\n\n“What's wrong? Most people would envy that. Naruto's Nine-Tails Seal, Ultraman's transformation, who wouldn't want powerful strength sealed within their body?”\n\nTang Shi said, wiggling her pinky finger, “Your change in attitude towards me, wasn't it also because you had that power to rely on?”\n\n“The crux of the problem is, it's changing.”\n\nZhou Ze said very seriously,\n\n“At first, I could feel it was unconscious. An unconscious thing, it doesn't matter, right? I can use it whenever I want.\n\nThe only side effect was lying in bed for half a month.\n\nBut now,\n\nAs I've used it more frequently, I've noticed it's changing. I clearly sense its consciousness, and even feel its consciousness and thoughts continuously perfecting themselves.\n\nAs I awaken it time and again, it is also repairing itself.\n\nLike a person, it's constantly healing its wounds, constantly recovering.\n\nEach time I use it to deal with a crisis,\n\nWhile it helps me solve problems, it also gets itself some nourishment. Most of my enemies and opponents become its sustenance.”\n\nUpon hearing this, Tang Shi's expression also grew serious, and she simultaneously said:\n\n“So, you're worried?”\n\n“Yes, I'm worried,\n\nAnd even starting to feel fear;\n\nBecause,\n\nIt's possible,\n\nThat the next time I let it awaken,\n\nWill be when it completely replaces me.”\n***\n<sup>1</sup> The original Chinese phrase '吃並欺凌時的冰涼' (chī bìng qīlíng shí de bīngliáng) literally means 'the coolness when eating and bullying'.

Their lifespans are clearly the same, but he always feels like he's losing out.\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze was a bit afraid to let that consciousness awaken again.\n\nTaking advantage of the warm sunshine, Zhou Ze pondered.\nThe prerequisite for not letting that consciousness awaken again was that he couldn't fall into another awkward and dangerous situation, a predicament beyond his current ability to solve or encounter.\nTo avoid falling into a helpless predicament, he needed to know how to maximize gains and avoid harm, and steer clear of trouble.\nAnd the precondition for not attracting excessive trouble was to be calm enough to avoid it, and to prevent trouble from finding him.\n\nSo,\nHe still needed to be a salted fish**.\nBeing a salted fish was the way to go.\nHe had to be more resolute and thoroughly commit to being a salted fish.\nDon't see, don't hear, don't go out.\nSunbathe every day, comfortably drink coffee, and resolutely avoid stirring up trouble or letting trouble stir him up.\n\nBoss Zhou previously just felt that being a salted fish was comfortable, a choice of his own.\nNow, being a salted fish had truly become a principle of survival.\n\nHowever, just as Boss Zhou woke up, and while Bai Yingying was making coffee for Zhou Ze, trouble arrived.\n\nThe one who entered was Zhang Yanfeng.\nBai Yingying had mentioned while he was showering that Zhang Yanfeng had been coming every two days for the past three weeks, and they had always put him off with the excuse that the boss was on a business trip.\n\nThis time, Zhang Yanfeng saw Zhou Ze as soon as he entered and immediately walked over.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head, lay sideways on the sofa, and closed his eyes. He really didn't want to see him.\n\n\"Did you see the news? The excavation work there has finished, revealing Japan's crimes in China back then, causing an uproar nationwide.\" As he spoke, Zhang Yanfeng's expression grew a bit awkward. \"It's just that the tragically deceased Japanese at the institute ruins made the propaganda slightly awkward.\"\n\n\"Are there any remains of your relatives?\"\n\n\"It's hard to find them. Doing DNA identification for each one would be too massive an undertaking, and the cost too great. Besides, there was an incinerator there; perhaps my relative was long ago burned to ash.\"\n\n\"It's good that you've come to terms with it.\"\n\n\"The day the excavation work finished, when I dreamt that night, I found that the iron chains were gone from my feet, as if a burden had been lifted from my heart,\" Zhang Yanfeng said with a smile.\n\n\"Congratulations, congratulations.\"\n\n\"By the way, where have you been recently? I've come looking for you many times, but your staff always said you weren't here.\"\n\n\"I went to borrow money.\nYou know, opening a bookstore on South Street really isn't good business, and I have an emotional attachment to this bookstore, so I need to borrow money to maintain its operation and existence.\nAlas, I didn't manage to borrow much.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Zhang Yanfeng awkwardly rubbed the back of his hand and said, \"What a shame. I don't have much money, otherwise, I'd definitely lend it to you.\"\n\nAt this moment, Bai Yingying brought Zhou Ze's coffee over and placed it on the table.\n\nZhang Yanfeng thought it was coffee prepared for guests, said \"Thank you,\" and picked it up to drink it himself.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched.\nHis heart was bleeding.\n\n\"I'm going out to borrow money; I can't delay, so I won't entertain you.\"\n\nZhou Ze directly issued an eviction notice.\n\n\"Uh, I came to see you about something.\"\n\nI know you have something, that's why I'm making you leave!\nBoss Zhou covered his temples with both hands and said painfully:\n\"Headache, a terrible headache. Money, I can't borrow money. How bitter, how worried, how difficult...\"\n\n\"The money issue isn't urgent for now.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to point at the other's nose and start cursing.\nThe money issue isn't urgent?\nHe believed Zhang Yanfeng was a selfless, good police officer of the people, but did his conscience not ache speaking like that?\n\n\"Initially, I came to you about the excavation work. After that, it was because I thought of a case I've had on hand for a long time with no progress.\nYou once said that if I encountered a very mysterious case, I could come to you to try, so I...\"\n\n\"Did I say that?\" Zhou Ze immediately asked.\n\n\"You did, that day in the park.\"\n\n\"That shouldn't be taken seriously. Besides, at that time, I had just been arrested by you and sent to the detention center. I was intimidated by your official authority, which is why I was just spouting nonsense.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThe conversation seemed difficult to continue.\n\nBut Zhang Yanfeng quickly followed up. He placed the case file on the table and said, \"This is the file for that case. I brought the parts I can show you. If you want to see more details, you can come to my office.\nHonestly, I didn't believe many things before.\nI am a Party member, I believe in Marxism-Leninism, and I am a staunch atheist.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pushed the file away. \"Exactly. You really shouldn't get too close to a charlatan like me.\"\n\n\"But the Party*** has taught us to rely on and unite all forces that can be united!\" Zhang Yanfeng said righteously. \"So, I think you might be able to provide some insights and conjectures on this case for me.\"\n\n\"I'm not a police officer; I'm just a man burdened by debt running a bookstore. Getting involved in cases like yours, isn't that inappropriate?\"\n\n\"I can give you the status of a police consultant.\"\n\nPolice consultant?\nThe last police consultant is still blind.\nZhou Ze instinctively looked up at the ceiling. Tang Shi said she was returning soon and the blind man still needed her care.\n\n\"To be honest with you, I don't want to do anything else right now,\" Zhou Ze sighed. \"The last incident at the institute cost me a great deal.\"\n\n\"Alright then, I won't press you. I'll leave this case file with you for now. Look at it whenever you want; it's an old, cold case anyway. I'll take my leave now. Thanks for the hospitality.\"\n\n\"Check please...\"\n\nZhou Ze called out,\nBut Zhang Yanfeng walked directly out of the bookstore as if he hadn't heard.\n\nAnd Old Daoist, who was sitting by the counter live-streaming, clearly pretended not to hear Zhou Ze's hint.\nWhat a joke!\nYou want me to ask a police officer for money?\nThis humble Daoist isn't that foolish!\n\nZhou Ze felt that his bookstore urgently needed a rectification campaign to correct this unhealthy trend of holding sinecures, indulging in pleasure, and neglecting proper duties!\n\n\"You're awake, I'm leaving.\"\n\nTang Shi came downstairs, changed her clothes, and held car keys in her hand.\n\n\"Goodbye.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved to her.\n\nShe nodded and walked out of the bookstore.\n\n\"Boss, drink some tea.\" Bai Yingying brought a cup of tea.\n\n\"Where's the coffee?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The one I just brewed was the last cup. That kind of coffee is all gone now,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"All gone?\"\n\nZhou Ze bit his lip.\nHis heart,\nPained him so much he couldn't breathe.\n\n\"What should we do with this case file?\" Bai Yingying asked, pointing at the file on the table.\n\n\"Throw it somewhere I can't see it,\" Zhou Ze said, casting a disgusted glance at the file.\n\nHe wouldn't open it to read it. He didn't want to know about any injustices, how cruel the murderer was, how pitiful the victims were, or how heinous the circumstances.\nHe didn't even want to look at it, preferring to pretend he knew nothing at all.\nIf he didn't know, he wouldn't feel guilty. If he didn't feel guilty, nothing would happen. If nothing happened, there would be no trouble.\n\nPicking up the tea, he took a sip. Zhou Ze then picked up his Ghost Messenger badge and glanced at it. The merit points on it hadn't increased in a long time and had remained at a very low level.\n\nFrowning,\nZhou Ze felt that his constant aimless messing around instead of doing proper work lately was truly a sin. Now, it seemed he had to seriously consider where to find ghosts to raise his merit points.\nBut truthfully, Tongcheng was only so big; it wasn't realistic to suddenly have it overrun with ghosts.\n\n\"Oh, right, what about the red spider lilies I asked you to seal last time?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Those? Lin Ke came by at some point and took them. She found a way to make them into sealed liquid jars, kept some for herself, and sent the rest back.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded with some relief.\nWaking up,\nHe had finally heard some good news.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang and called out:\n\"What's for dinner?\"\n\nXu Qinglang removed the facial mask from his face and looked at Zhou Ze as if he had seen a ghost. He didn't realize how much Zhou Ze yearned to \"eat heartily\" right now.\n\n\"Alright, I'll go out and buy groceries.\"\n\nXu Qinglang wore an expression of helplessness.\nHe was the spitting image of a wife whose husband was unproductive,\nA lazy bum who clung to the house all day, yet she still had to reluctantly cook for him.\n\n\"Come for a walk with me, I've been lying down too long.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying helped Zhou Ze out of the bookstore.\nJust outside the door, Zhou Ze saw an old woman who looked like a scavenger fumbling around the bookstore's display window.\n\n\"Go ask what she's doing,\" Zhou Ze said. The old woman didn't seem to be begging; although her clothes were ragged, her face and hair looked very clean and spirited.\n\nBai Yingying ran over to ask. The old woman spoke and gestured, telling Bai Yingying something.\n\nZhou Ze leaned against a nearby utility pole and lit a cigarette. Before he had taken two puffs, Yingying returned.\n\"Boss, I found out. She said she's looking for something.\"\n\n\"Looking for what?\"\n\n\"Flowers.\"\n____________________\n*   \"吃雞\" (chī jī), literally \"eating chicken,\" is a Chinese internet slang term for winning in battle royale games like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG).\n**  \"鹹魚\" (xiányú), literally \"salted fish,\" is a Chinese internet slang term for someone who is lazy, unmotivated, and content with doing nothing.\n*** The original text uses \"***\" to represent the Party.",

    "content": "The hand holding the cigarette trembled slightly.\n\nHe had just made a grand vow, determined to be a good \"salted fish\"¹ who slacked off and dozed off every day.\n\nWho would have thought that while the vow was still fresh, trouble would come knocking.\n\nThe last time, the earth mound grave, the Spring Pavilion on the small street inside, the Bald Monk's paper effigy clone, plus the Manjusaka flower² he had taken from there to use as seasoning.\n\nWhat gave Zhou Ze the biggest headache was that he hadn't even gotten to \"feast to his heart's content\" yet, and the owner had already come looking for it.\n\nOf course, if you asked about guilt, there really wasn't any.\n\nBoss Zhou didn't feel guilty like a thief who had stolen someone else's belongings.\n\nThose people had set up that small barrier, attracting nearby departed souls and using them as fodder to nourish the Manjusaka flower. They had effectively tortured souls who could have gone to the Yellow Springs or hell to be reincarnated, crippling them and severing their chance at rebirth.\n\nThis was an act that greatly harmed one's accumulated virtue. Zhou Ze not bragging that he was \"executing Heaven's justice\" was already being modest; how could he possibly feel guilty about this matter?\n\n\"My flower, where's my flower?\"\n\nThe old woman shakily walked up to Zhou Ze, reached out and grabbed his shoulders. Her sunken eyes held a desperate and frantic look as she violently shook Zhou Ze's body, shouting loudly.\n\nBoss Zhou had just woken up from a coma, and his body was still weak. This old woman, though seemingly frail, actually had a surprising amount of strength, shaking Boss Zhou until he was almost out of breath.\n\n\"Let go!\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately reached out and pulled the old woman away. The old woman's body tilted backward, then she directly fell to the ground and fainted.\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, is this a staged accident?\"³ Bai Yingying asked.\n\nZhou Ze also frowned, thinking, that shouldn't be right. He had once pondered with the little loli about who set up that barrier to cultivate the Manjusaka flower. Whether the person was alive or dead, whether in the mortal realm or hell, they should at least be someone of standing, right?\n\nAn ordinary person wouldn't have the qualifications, let alone the ability, for such a grand scheme.\n\nBut this old woman, who came to demand payment, was too much of a weakling, wasn't she? Bai Yingying just pushed her, and she fainted? Did she want to extort money?\n\nBoss Zhou didn't mind spending some hell money or Renminbi to satisfy the other party and send them away. Compared to the chain of troubles this matter might cause, Zhou Ze felt that spending money to avert disaster was completely acceptable.\n\nAfter all, Zhou Ze's mindset had changed somewhat after realizing that his greatest reliance had become his biggest powder keg.\n\nBefore, he was Zhou Teddy⁴, feeling invincible enough to conquer heaven, earth, and air; now, he was Zhou Salted Fish⁵.\n\nThere were quite a few pedestrians on the road casting glances, but no one specifically came over to look. Everyone avoided trouble, at most slowing down as they passed by, wondering if there was any excitement to watch.\n\nThis was like \"virtuous\" men, regardless of age, always pretending to casually glance at what color stockings the ladies inside were wearing when passing a small street-side hair salon.\n\nTherefore, Boss Zhou didn't feel there was anything wrong with his current mindset and attitude towards life.\n\nOpening his eyes, he saw that the bustling secular world, bustling with people coming and going, was full of salted fish.\n\n***\n\n\"Mmm, mmm, mmm... delicious, delicious!!!!\"\n\n\"So good... the taste is so good!!!!\"\n\nAt the dinner table, Zhou Ze sat leaning on a chair. Xu Qinglang stood by, watching which dish was running low and then stir-frying a bit more to serve.\n\nThe old woman ate \"gobbling down\" by herself, like someone just released from an ancient prison. Especially the extremely greasy pork hock she held in her left hand, which she ate with oil dripping from her mouth.\n\nThat was originally a hearty dish Xu Qinglang had specially prepared for Zhou Ze to \"feast to his heart's content\" tonight.\n\nThe Old Taoist accompanied her in drinking, pouring wine for the old woman. The old woman also clinked glasses with the Old Taoist from time to time, drinking it all down in one gulp, very spiritedly.\n\nOf course, although they seemed to be of similar age, the Old Taoist didn't fancy his peers; he preferred those pitiful women in their forties from the hair salons, who were younger than him.\n\nYes, they were starting to show their age and lose their charm, women whom the lecherous old Bai Juyi would describe as \"having few carriages and horses at their door.\"⁶\n\nBut if you patronized them and cared for them, they would be more grateful and serve you better, unlike those young ones who, with good business, were very high-maintenance⁷.\n\nBut the Old Taoist also found the old woman quite amiable. Otherwise, you couldn't possibly ask Bai Yingying to entertain her, could you? Though Bai Yingying's age also seemed quite advanced.\n\nThe old woman kept eating, endlessly, like a reincarnated hungry ghost. The ingredients Xu Qinglang bought tonight to prepare a grand meal for Zhou Ze had basically all gone into the old woman's stomach. Zhou Ze at this point naturally wouldn't go out of his way to show off the oral solution made from the Manjusaka flower while eating.\n\n\"Hah...\" She was full.\n\nThe old woman patted her round, distended belly, a look of satisfaction on her face.\n\nThen she looked at Xu Qinglang, who was to one side, and gave a thumbs up, saying:\n\n\"Girl, you cook really well.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nOld Xu suddenly felt that not putting a little arsenic in the dishes was a bit incomplete.\n\n\"Heh heh, sister, he's a man, ha ha ha ha ha.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist explained laughingly,\n\n\"Sister, you don't know, the first time I saw him, I almost had an erection.\"\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, he's a man?\" The old woman looked Xu Qinglang over carefully again, nodded, and said: \"He really is a handsome young man, what a pity. If it were back in the late Qing Dynasty, with your looks, taking the stage as a young male opera lead, who knows how many people you'd charm. The brothel districts would be full of your admirers.\"\n\nThe old woman casually mentioned \"late Qing Dynasty,\" her aura and reminiscence truly profound.\n\nThis left the Old Taoist beside her at a loss for words. \"We look about the same age,\" he thought, \"but I was only born the year before liberation. That was still 'eight zhang'⁸ away from the late Qing Dynasty!\"\n\n\"It's just that the oil used was a bit excessive. I suppose you've cooked too many large-pot meals in the past, and too many flowing banquets, so it naturally lacks a bit of finesse. The taste is excellent, but there are countless delicious dishes in this world. Regardless of your palate's preferences, honestly, can any dish be so good that it makes you swallow your tongue? It's simply a difference in the thought put into the finesse, understand?\"\n\nXu Qinglang paused slightly at her words, then nodded, \"I've learned a lot.\"\n\nThe old woman exhaled, saying with some disinterest:\n\n\"Never mind, never mind. This food, no matter what, is quite good. Keep up the good work; study hard in the future and strive to reach a higher level. It seems the cooking skills of the princely mansion chefs from the late Qing Dynasty are truly something I won't be able to taste again.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" Xu Qinglang nodded.\n\n\"When your culinary skills advance further, you'll probably be dead by then. Come down to the underworld and cook specifically for me.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang's negative emotions +999.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened. Was the main event here?\n\nTalking about hell, talking about Manjusaka flowers, meant that both parties' identities had been revealed, and there was no longer any need to hide things away, like looking at flowers through a fog⁹.\n\n\"Why the long face? With your half-baked Xuanxue¹⁰ skills, don't even think about changing your fate in this life. You can't escape birth, old age, sickness, and death. Besides, is following a small netherworld constable better than following an old woman like me?\"\n\nAs she spoke, the old woman rudely pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, looking very disdainful.\n\nBut the aura she exuded in her every gesture at that moment didn't seem feigned. An ordinary person, without such experience or temperament, couldn't fake this feeling.\n\n\"Sister... oh no, Elder Sister, you're a big shot down below too, aren't you? Hey, this humble Taoist had already noticed it. Elder Sister, you clearly aren't an ordinary person. By the sound of it, are you a Manchu? No offense, but this humble Taoist's ancestors were also Manchus, from the Niohuru clan!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist immediately offered flattery. Your loyal Old Taoist is now online.\n\nAfter people get old, all they care about is their afterlife. But the Old Taoist had no children, so he didn't have to worry about descendants. Now, having a chance to inquire about his affairs after death, this was a great opportunity.\n\n\"Oh?\" The old woman squinted her drunken eyes at the Old Taoist, while also reaching out and patting the Old Taoist's face. \"Truly Manchu?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"But this old woman, back in the late Qing Dynasty, was with the Tongmenghui¹¹. That meal at the princely mansion? It was a meal we crashed after breaking into a prince's home.\"\n\n\"...\" The Old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze lightly tapped the tabletop and said: \"Let's get back to the main topic.\"\n\nYou've eaten and drunk your fill, it's time you got down to business.\n\n\"Heh, get down to business?\" The old woman stretched, \"The Manjusaka flower, is it with you?\"\n\n\"More or less.\"\n\nIf it was a blessing, it wouldn't be a disaster; if it was a disaster, it couldn't be avoided. Boss Zhou simply hardened his stance.\n\n\"Do you know who I am?\" The old woman pointed to her face and asked.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\nInitially, Zhou Ze guessed the other party might be Meng Po, but since she was from the late Qing Dynasty, she shouldn't be Meng Po. Moreover, it was unlikely for a prominent figure from the underworld like Meng Po to personally come to the mortal realm.\n\n\"Heh heh, so I don't know what exactly gave you the courage.\" The old woman stood up, placed her hand on Zhou Ze's chest, and said: \"This old woman wants to see, where does your courage and reliance come from?\"\n\nThat greasy hand, which had just held the pork hock, was rummaging around on his chest.\n\nBoss Zhou, who had germophobia, felt very uncomfortable and tormented, and couldn't help but reach out to swat away her hand.\n\n\"Oh, I see now. Who'd have thought this small Tongcheng actually harbors hidden dragons and crouching tigers. A mere netherworld constable actually has a hidden identity.\"\n\nThe old woman took another sip of rice wine, laughing until her yellow front teeth were exposed.\n\n\"But don't you know, you're merely the sentience that coincidentally emerged during the period when that one in your body was in a coma? In other words, you're nothing at all. What are you so arrogant about? After death, when people become zombies, that's still a new life born from death. As for you? You don't even count as that. At most, you're just a watchdog tied to the door when the master leaves home. When the master returns, it'll be dog meat stew for dinner.\"\n\n---\n¹ **Salted fish (鹹魚)**: A Chinese slang term referring to someone who has no ambition or motivation, happy to just laze around and do nothing.\n² **Manjusaka flower (彼岸花)**: Also known as the \"flower of the other shore\" or \"spider lily,\" often associated with death and the afterlife in Buddhist legends.\n³ **Staged accident (碰瓷兒)**: A scam where someone pretends to be hit by a vehicle or injured to extort money.\n⁴ **Zhou Teddy (周泰迪)**: A play on the name Zhou Ze. \"Teddy\" (泰迪) is a breed of dog known for its energetic and sometimes aggressive mating behavior, implying Zhou Ze's previous overbearing arrogance.\n⁵ **Zhou Salted Fish (周鹹魚)**: A play on Zhou Ze's name, meaning \"Zhou the Salted Fish,\" implying his current desire for a lazy, unambitious life.\n⁶ **\"Having few carriages and horses at their door\" (門前冷落車馬稀)**: A line from Bai Juyi's poem \"Song of the Pipa Player,\" referring to a courtesan who has lost her popularity and clients.\n⁷ **High-maintenance (機車得很)**: Colloquial Taiwanese slang, often used to describe someone or something that is difficult to deal with, bothersome, or high-maintenance.\n⁸ **\"Eight zhang away\" (八丈遠吶)**: An idiom meaning \"very far away.\" One zhang is approximately 3.3 meters.\n⁹ **\"Looking at flowers through a fog\" (霧裡看花)**: An idiom meaning to have an unclear understanding of something.\n¹⁰ **Xuanxue (玄術)**: A broad term referring to Chinese metaphysics, mystical arts, and esoteric practices.\n¹¹ **Tongmenghui (同盟會)**: Also known as the Chinese United League, a secret society and underground resistance movement founded by Sun Yat-sen in the late Qing Dynasty, aiming to overthrow the Qing monarchy and establish a republic.",

    "content": "The old woman’s sarcastic remarks made everyone present instinctively fall silent for a moment.\n\nBai Yingying was silent.\n\nXu Qinglang was silent.\n\nThe Old Daoist was silent.\n\nDeadpool, who had been silent all along, remained silent.\n\nAs a subordinate employee, when your boss is openly exposed, what else can you do but remain silent?\n\n\"Click!\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, and then slowly exhaled smoke rings.\n\nWhat the old woman said was actually very similar to what Zhou Ze himself had guessed, but if you were to say that the old woman really hurt Zhou Ze's pride or anything, that truly wasn't the case.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't that thin-skinned*.\n\nHowever, seeing this old woman speak as if from ancient times*, her domineering and aggressive posture, it was indeed very uncomfortable.\n\nThis was the Late Night Bookstore.\n\nThis was, after all, his own shop.\n\nIn simpler terms, this was Zhou Ze's domain*, or his \"lair.\"\n\nEven a mighty dragon can't overpower a local snake*!\n\n\"Have you said enough?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What's wrong? Are you angry?\" The old woman looked as if her prediction had come true.\n\n\"Yes.\" Zhou Ze admitted.\n\n\"Give me the Red Spider Lily*. Then, come with me to settle this matter. Your specific fate will depend on your performance.\"\n\nThe old woman sat down again.\n\nShe even proactively took a cigarette from in front of Zhou Ze and lit it herself.\n\nThat posture,\n\nThat expression,\n\nHad a certain charm of a female singer smoking backstage at an old Shanghai dance hall.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the dishes on the table and said:\n\n\"You should pay first.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe old woman frowned, as if she hadn't understood.\n\n\"Here, for the ghosts who depart, I always arrange a cold meal in advance. When they go, they also leave some spirit money*.\n\nYou, on the other hand, had both wine and meat; that's the highest standard here. Leave more money.\"\n\nThe old woman's eyes narrowed.\n\nHer withered palm slapped the tabletop fiercely, and she snapped:\n\n\"Do you know who you're talking to?\"\n\n\"Paying for your meal is only right and proper.\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\n\n\"Heh heh, what if I say I won't pay?\" the old woman said sharply.\n\nBefore, she hadn't revealed her identity, so it didn't matter.\n\nNow that she had revealed her identity, Zhou Ze treated her with even greater disrespect than before. She couldn't tolerate it!\n\nIt was like emperors on incognito inspections; it didn't matter if you joked with them while they were in disguise, but once they put on their dragon robes, if you still treated them casually, you'd end up at the execution ground*.\n\n\"Won't pay?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the Old Daoist sitting in front and said:\n\n\"Beat her up.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist shivered.\n\n\"Holy crap,\"\n\n\"Beat her up?\"\n\n\"Boss,\"\n\n\"I'm a person who can die! What happens after I die?\"\n\nThe Old Daoist was still hesitating. Who the hell wouldn't hesitate, damn it?\n\nUnless you're certain you're immortal; even if you were immortal, you couldn't guarantee that nothing unexpected would happen.\n\nBut looking at Zhou Ze's expression,\n\nThe Old Daoist knew that if he didn't obey the order today, he might not even live to die of old age; the boss would send him a quick delivery* ahead of time.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nThe Old Daoist raised his hand,\n\nToward the old woman's arm,\n\nAnd gently patted it.\n\nThis force, this weight,\n\nRather than hitting someone,\n\nIt was more like playful banter* between an old couple.\n\nAs distance tests a horse's strength, so time reveals a person's heart*.\n\nZhou Ze gently touched his own head, then waved his hand lightly.\n\n\"Close the door,\n\nRelease Yingying*.\"\n\nAnyway, Yingying was an orthodox zombie.\n\nEven if she died, she wouldn't enter reincarnation*; it would be a direct annihilation of her existence. She wouldn't go to hell or cross the Yellow Springs**, so she wasn't afraid of future retaliation***.\n\nMoreover, this girl had a natural loyalty and obedience toward Zhou Ze.\n\nAs expected,\n\nYingying didn't disappoint Zhou Ze.\n\nShe walked directly forward.\n\n\"You dare call my boss a dog?\" Bai Yingying said, hands on her hips, looking at the old woman.\n\n\"Haha, he is just a dog. Little girl, your lineage is actually much purer than his. He's just parading in borrowed finery*; he's not him at all.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nHe hesitated a little,\n\nAnd felt a bit lost.\n\nNot because of what the old woman said,\n\nBut because of Bai Yingying.\n\nYes, Bai Yingying was very obedient to him, but that was based on her sensing the aura of a higher-level zombie from him. It was the suppression of his lineage over hers that forced her to submit to him, turning her from a cold, aloof female zombie into his saccharine darling*.\n\nNow,\n\nShe knew he was just a facade.\n\nWould she still listen to him?\n\nFurthermore, if the consciousness within him issued a summons,\n\nWould Bai Yingying directly obey that consciousness's command and turn against him?\n\nBoss Zhou was feeling a bit weak now.\n\nSuddenly, he realized he had no capital whatsoever.\n\nHe used to think he was a low-level character with max-level divine gear*, free to show off anywhere.\n\nNow he discovered that all his equipment was borrowed from others after being bound to them, and he himself might even be someone else's pre-assigned experience bar*.\n\nPanic,\n\nHe couldn't help but panic.\n\nThe panic of a salted fish*.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nBai Yingying slapped the old woman across the face, sending her flying to crash hard against the wall.\n\nShe truly held nothing back!\n\nThe old woman was surprisingly resilient, only bleeding slightly from the corner of her mouth and suffering minor skin tears.\n\n\"You!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe old woman pointed at Bai Yingying.\n\n\"You audacious wretch! A mere zombie, a petty abomination, not subject to reincarnation*! Heaven...\"\n\n\"Bang bang!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying directly reached out and grabbed the old woman's neck,\n\nLifting her up.\n\n\"You............\" The old woman tried to speak but couldn't.\n\n\"Dare to insult my boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying instantly transformed into a violent high school beauty style*.\n\nGrabbing the old woman by the neck,\n\n\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\"\n\nShe relentlessly slammed her against the wall!\n\nOne time,\n\nTwo times,\n\nThree times,\n\nFour times............\n\nShe kept smashing, without stopping!\n\nPresumably, the shop next door thought the bookstore was undergoing renovations.\n\nThe Old Daoist watched, sucking in a cold breath.\n\nXu Qinglang watched in silence.\n\nThe little monkey watched, so engrossed that the peanuts in its paws fell to the floor.\n\nEven Deadpool, who had been sitting motionless against the wall, swayed continuously due to the trembling walls.\n\nZhou Ze continued to smoke nearby,\n\nSmoking fiercely.\n\nFinally,\n\nAfter an unknown number of impacts,\n\nBai Yingying threw the old woman down.\n\nThe old woman was bruised and swollen, her hair disheveled, and she had lost who knows how many teeth.\n\nBut she was still alive!\n\n\"You............you............you dare............you dare to do this to me............Don't die............Don't die............\"\n\nThe Old Daoist sat on the side, shaking his hand repeatedly,\n\nSignaling that it had nothing to do with him.\n\nBecause inside the bookstore,\n\nBai Yingying and the boss wouldn't die, Xu Qinglang was still young. Damn it, calculating it all, he was the one who would die earliest and fastest!\n\nZhou Ze tossed his cigarette butt, shakily stood up, walked over to the old woman, and slowly squatted down.\n\nBai Yingying stood by, showing no hint of the exhilaration or wildness of violently smashing a sandbag. Instead, after Zhou Ze approached, her eyes welled up with tears, as if she were crying.\n\nZhou Ze looked up in surprise at Bai Yingying beside him and asked:\n\n\"Why are you crying?\"\n\n\"She said bad things about you, Boss. I couldn't stand it.\"\n\n\"What she said wasn't false. There's nothing to be angry about.\"\n\nZhou Ze comforted her.\n\nWhat she said,\n\nWas, after all, the truth.\n\n\"No, what she said wasn't right at all.\n\nBoss is Boss, not some kind of watchdog. Boss is Boss.\n\nIn Yingying's eyes, you are my boss, not that thing inside your body.\n\nThat thing is really scary. Yingying doesn't like it.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled happily.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze extended his hand, nails growing on his fingers, and directly grabbed the old woman's head, then fiercely pulled upwards.\n\nYou're an indestructible cockroach*,\n\nThen I'll rip out your soul!\n\nThe old woman's soul was indeed extracted by Zhou Ze.\n\nBut her appearance immediately changed.\n\nStill in the old woman's likeness,\n\nBut she wore a long black hat, its brim extending downwards, falling to the floor. Her face was also adorned with many symbols*, and it was clear she was no ordinary ghost.\n\n\"That array wasn't set up by you. And the Red Spider Lily wasn't planted by you either.\" Zhou Ze analyzed:\n\n\"Aside from being tough, you have no other abilities. So, you're someone who came out of hell specifically to investigate this matter?\"\n\n\"You know I'm from hell, and you still dare to treat me like this!\" the old woman snarled.\n\n\"You're a big fish. My merit points* haven't increased in a long time.\n\nAlso,\n\nI heard those who work in hell get a lot of perks*. It's a case of plucking a feather from every passing goose**, isn't it? You ate such a fine meal here at my place. If I send you down, not only will it be a good performance record, but the spirit money should also be quite generous, right?\"\n\n\"How dare you!\"\n\nThe old woman was a bit flustered.\n\nIt wasn't easy for someone of her status to come up here; the cost was immense. If she went back down without completing her mission, her fate would be grim!\n\nZhou Ze nodded. It seemed he had guessed correctly.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, opened WeChat, and placed a WeChat video call to Lin Ke.\n\nIt was answered quickly on the other end.\n\nRevealing Lin Ke, lying on the bed in a loli dress.\n\n\"Her, do you know her?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed the phone at the old woman.\n\n\"She............she's the Night Watchman of the Bridge of Lamentation*. How could she be here?\n\nIs she here to investigate the Red Spider Lily?\n\nAh,\n\nHow did her soul get out?\n\nWho did it?!\n\nWas it you?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you've caused trouble. If you let her go down and tell them below about your transgressions, then the Bridge of Lamentation will lodge a complaint* against you with the Underworld authorities. Don't just say you're only an underworld messenger now; even if you were an inspector, you wouldn't be able to bear it!\"\n\n\"I understand what you mean,\" Zhou Ze said, suddenly enlightened. \"Your meaning is, I shouldn't send her soul to hell, but instead, I should just destroy it here.\"\n\n\"............\" Lin Ke.\n\nLin Ke: **&amp;*@@#￥%￥\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking,\n\nZhou Ze's nails began to furiously knead and pierce the old woman's soul,\n\nAs if he had gone mad!\n\nYou called me a watchdog,\n\nYou called me worthless!\n\nYou dared to show off in front of me!\n\nToday, I'll make you realize,\n\nEven a dog,\n\nWhen cornered,\n\nWill bite!\n\nAmidst the old woman's pathetic screams,\n\nHer soul was ultimately successfully torn apart by Zhou Ze.\n\nAll around,\n\nWafted wisps of ash.\n\nIt was over.\n\nEverything was over.\n\nA lingering smile hung on Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nClosing his eyes,\n\nHe sat directly on the floor.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nHe suddenly found the feeling he had as a child, sitting alone in the backyard of the orphanage.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n*   **薄臉皮 (thin-skinned)**: In this context, \"局气儿\" (júqì'er) can describe someone who is generous, principled, or, as implied here, easily offended or thin-skinned.

    "content": "「Here, *kudingcha*.\"\n\nWang Ke placed the tea in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n*Kudingcha*, also known as bitter tea, lives up to its name.\n\nBut ever since Wang Ke started drinking tea, he'd fallen in love with this flavor. He drank this type of tea daily, whether at home or in the office.\n\nYou could say he was \"recalling past bitterness to appreciate current sweetness,\"¹ and he truly deserved to \"recall past bitterness to appreciate current sweetness.\" From an orphan who had nothing, to reaching his current position, he was as successful as one could possibly be. All the hardships he had endured were swirling within this cup of bitter tea.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the teacup, took a sip, slowly chewed the tea dregs, put down the teacup, and lit another cigarette.\n\n\"Feeling lonely, aren't you?\"\n\nWang Ke said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nAs a psychiatrist, his greatest skill was actually observing words and expressions. This was a discipline that seemed easy to learn but was very difficult to master well.\n\n\"Where's your daughter?\"\n\n\"Oh, school's almost out.\"\n\n\"And your wife?\"\n\n\"She went to get her hair done;\nThen she'll probably pick up the kid from school. She should be back soon, right?\"\n\n\"You're really trusting, letting her go out like that.\"\n\n\"Most of the time, she's still normal.\"\n\nWang Ke exhaled towards the teacup in front of him, then picked it up and took a sip.\n\nThe bitterness entered his throat, no less potent than *baijiu* burning through one's gut.\n\n\"I wanted to talk to someone, but I didn't know who, so I thought of you.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze finished speaking, he smiled.\n\nIt was evident that he was feeling somewhat down.\n\nEradicating the old woman's soul in one fell swoop did not allow Boss Zhou to vent any inner rage. Instead, it was like having \"fast food\"² by the roadside—seemingly an intense activity had ended,\n\nBut upon walking out, he couldn't hide the deep sense of loss and emptiness within.\n\nZhou Ze didn't feel his action was decisive or resolute.\n\nThat was truly just a cornered dog leaping over the wall.\n\nMerely the madness displayed by someone pushed to an emotional corner,\n\nA brute's act,\n\nNothing to brag about.\n\nUltimately,\n\nWould the Bridge of Helplessness³ know about this?\n\nWould he face consequences?\n\nHe didn't know, and he wasn't clear.\n\n\"I can understand that feeling of yours. When we were kids, we were both the same.\" Wang Ke pushed the ashtray closer to Zhou Ze, continuing, \"We started off so much worse than our peers, and we had a stronger sense of crisis than our peers, because we experienced the fear of having nothing. That's why we understand the principle of cherishing things better.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Wang Ke, saying nothing.\n\n\"Right now, you're giving me the feeling as if we're still in the orphanage.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\n\"It's true. That feeling of having no one to rely on, that hesitation and confusion about the future—I see it in you, clearly and distinctly.\"\n\n\"I already had nothing. In my previous life, I struggled and toiled until thirty, only for a car accident to incinerate it all;\nIn this life, I discovered an even harder truth to accept: that my entire existence was merely a misunderstanding, a probability, or perhaps even... a joke.\"\n\n\"And then? What do you plan to do?\"\n\nWang Ke reached up and stroked his chin.\n\nTo be honest, for Wang Ke, he felt confident facing all sorts of clients. His talent, his achievements in psychology, and his experience allowed him to solve most problems.\n\nBut when facing Zhou Ze,\n\nAll of Wang Ke's previous confidence simply vanished.\n\nAfter all,\n\nThere wasn't a single course in school that specifically taught the psychological study of \"ghosts.\"\n\n\"Your question is too vague.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright then, what do you plan to do tomorrow? What will you be doing?\nFor example, what do you plan to do when you wake up in the morning, what do you plan to do at noon, and what do you plan to do in the evening? That way, it'll become specific and clear.\"\n\n\"In the morning...\"\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment before answering:\n\n\"In the morning, I'll sit by the window in the bookstore, bask in the sun, and drink coffee.\"\n\n\"............\" Wang Ke.\n\nSuppressing the urge to cough, Wang Ke bit the bullet and continued to ask:\n\n\"What about noon then? After eating, will you continue reading the newspaper?\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, shaking his head, and said, \"Of course not reading the newspaper, and not drinking coffee either.\"\n\n\"Hm, that's good then.\"\n\nWang Ke let out a long sigh of relief,\n\nFeeling that his childhood friend,\n\nStill had hope for salvation.\n\n\"The newspaper only has so much space. From noon to afternoon, I'll switch to a book. There are quite a few books in the bookstore, and I won't sit in the same spot. The morning sun is quite comfortable, but the afternoon sun is too strong. I'll choose a corner, lie on my side, and flip through a book.\nWhen the mood strikes, I'll read some serious literature or ancient works.\nIf I get bored, I'll find some contemporary novels for a change of pace. Sometimes, I find these novels quite interesting too.\nAnd I won't drink coffee anymore. After all, too much coffee isn't good for the heart; I used to be a doctor, so I understand this principle.\nI'll switch to tea, but not your kind of bitter tea. I have plenty of good tea leaves that I bought at a high price.\"\n\n\"............\" Wang Ke.\n\n\"As for the evening, I'll see if there's any business. If there is, I'll do it. If not, I'll close up when it's time, take a shower, and go to bed.\"\n\nWang Ke looked at the ashtray in front of him,\n\nFor some reason,\n\nHe suddenly had an urge,\n\nWhich was to pick up this ashtray and smash his childhood friend's head until it bled!\n\n\"Is this kind of life interesting?\"\n\nWang Ke organized his words, continuing:\n\n\"Or, will this kind of life help with the troubles you're currently facing? Can it improve your problems and resolve your worries?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nObviously not.\n\nIn this world, there's no such thing as a free lunch.\n\n\"Then you still plan to do this?\" Wang Ke patiently tried to persuade him.\n\nHonestly,\n\nHe felt so tired, truly exhausted.\n\n\"But my worries and concerns are actually that in the future, I might not be able to live this 'salted fish'⁴ kind of life anymore.\nSo why,\nTo protect this lifestyle of mine, would I now actively change this state myself?\"\n\nWang Ke reached up and wiped his forehead,\n\nHe was completely confused by Zhou Ze's words.\n\nYes,\n\nBoss Zhou quite liked this life—\n\nA bookstore, a maid, a newspaper, a ray of sunshine. A day and a night would pass like this, a month, a year, also passing in the same way.\n\nHe didn't like disrupting this tranquility, nor was he willing to destroy this atmosphere.\n\nThis was a principle he had realized after his death, a philosophy of life completely different from his previous one.\n\nThe two men's conversation reached an impasse.\n\nFortunately, the entrance door opened.\n\nThe little loli and her mother returned.\n\nAs soon as she entered, the little loli stared intently at Zhou Ze for a while, the anger in the depths of her eyes incredibly clear!\n\nHe had caused trouble again,\n\nHe had stirred up trouble again.\n\nThe little loli felt very wronged.\n\nWhy, ever since she started following him, did she have to live in fear every single day!\n\nAfter following him,\n\nThe little loli suddenly felt her life had become exceptionally thrilling!\n\nSo thrilling it was unbelievable!\n\nWang Ke's wife went upstairs by herself after returning with the child.\n\nRegarding this,\n\nZhou Ze, as a guest, didn't feel the slightest bit neglected.\n\nOn the contrary,\n\nIf Wang Ke's wife had enthusiastically urged him to stay for dinner, that would have been the most unacceptable thing for Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xiao Rui, go do your homework.\"\n\nWang Ke motioned for his daughter to leave first.\n\nWang Rui nodded obediently, and carrying her schoolbag, also went upstairs to her room.\n\nZhou Ze also took the opportunity to stand up and say goodbye.\n\nWang Ke wanted him to stay and chat a bit longer. He felt he should inject more vitality into his childhood friend's outlook on life, but clearly, this was a bit like playing the lute to a cow.⁵\n\nAfter leaving Wang Ke's house, Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to depart. Instead, he sat down on a long bench in the community garden.\n\nBefore long, a petite figure walked up behind Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Very angry?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't need to turn around to know who had arrived.\n\n\"I'm numb with anger.\"\n\nThe little loli sat down on the long bench beside Zhou Ze,\n\n\"Your Chinese language was taught by your math teacher, wasn't it?\" the little loli scoffed. \"Then your reading comprehension must be perfect.\" The little loli said huffily, \"You just killed someone like that. Does this mean that once it's discovered, there'll be absolutely no room for maneuver?\"\n\n\"If I had kept her, would there have been room?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, saying casually:\n\n\"The person... oh no, the ghost is already killed. Discussing this further is pointless.\"\n\n\"So what do you plan to do next?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'what do I plan to do'? I'll just continue living my life.\"\n\n\"You've lit the powder keg, and now you're pretending nothing happened?\"\n\nZhou Ze fell silent.\n\nTen minutes passed.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth and said, \"Are there any cultivation methods?\"\n\n\"You want to learn?\" The little loli looked at Zhou Ze with some surprise. \"You want to become stronger?\"\n\n\"Sometimes I get bored, so I want to find something to do.\"\n\n\"Do you think this is some idiotic cultivation fantasy novel?\nLike those books on the shelves in your bookstore?\nWe ghost messengers—like me—ever since we were revived, all our abilities have been fixed. Our talents, our divine powers, they've long been set.\nUnless you become a temple god to accumulate incense offerings, or use other insidious methods, proper cultivation might have a slight effect in hell, but in the realm of the living, it's useless.\"\n\n\"Well, that's certainly a headache.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit downhearted,\n\nSubconsciously reaching up to rub his temples.\n\nHowever, his heart also settled, and the last trace of guilt was wiped away.\n\nSee?\n\nIt's not that I don't want to strive, it's not that I want to be a 'salted fish.'\n\nThe truth is, there's no difference between cultivating and not cultivating.\n\n\"However...\" The little loli suddenly changed her tone.\n\nThen,\n\nBoss Zhou suddenly stood up,\n\nHurriedly walked to the community entrance and reached out to hail a taxi,\n\nHe was just short of covering his ears, stomping his feet, and loudly proclaiming, \"I'm not listening, I'm not listening, a turtle chanting sutras!\"⁶\n\nThis left the little loli, who was about to introduce a twist to pique Zhou Ze's interest, momentarily dumbfounded.\n\n*Ganlinniang!*⁷\n\nThis guy is just terrified I'll mention some cultivation method that will prevent him from being a 'salted fish,' isn't he!\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ Literally \"recalling past bitterness to appreciate current sweetness,\" an idiom meaning to reflect on past hardships to appreciate present blessings.\n² Literally \"fast food,\" used here as a euphemism for a quick and often unsatisfying intimate encounter.\n³ The Bridge of Helplessness (Naihe Bridge) is a mythological bridge in Chinese Buddhism that souls must cross before reincarnation.\n⁴ Literally \"salted fish-like life,\" an idiom referring to a life of idleness, lacking ambition, and doing nothing.\n⁵ A Chinese idiom, literally \"playing the lute to a cow,\" meaning to preach to deaf ears or to waste effort on someone who cannot appreciate it.\n⁶ A dismissive, childish phrase in Chinese, literally \"not listening, not listening, a turtle chanting sutras,\" indicating a refusal to listen to unwelcome or perceived useless advice.\n⁷ A vulgar Hokkien (Min Nan) exclamation, akin to \"f*** your mother,\" used here to express extreme frustration.",

    "content": "Taxis are strange existences.\n\nWhen you don't need one, they drive past you one after another, slowly, with their \"No Passenger\" lights on, and the drivers even wink at you, as if expecting you to get in.\n\nBut when you need one, you'll find they're gone again, and even if there is one, it's already occupied.\n\nBoss Zhou was in precisely this situation.\n\nWhere are the cars?\n\nWhere are the cars?\n\nWhere have the cars gone?\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nLittle Loli walked over slowly, her hands clasped behind her back.\n\nHonestly, Little Loli was a bit despairing of Zhou Ze.\n\nThrough a series of coincidences, their positions were inverted; Zhou Ze, originally meant to be \"destroyed after use\" in her eyes, had become her \"chief constable\" boss, holding power over her life and death.\n\nWhether she liked it or not, the current situation and reality couldn't be changed.\n\nAnd so, whenever Zhou Ze did something out of line, Little Loli had no choice but to help him clean up after him^1, just like that dumb female zombie in her eyes.\n\nThis was Tongcheng, and she was also a ghost messenger of Tongcheng. She had a subordinate relationship with Zhou Ze, so they truly rose and fell together^2.\n\nProsperity she hadn't seen, but adversity had been continuous, many times over.\n\nSadness, mental exhaustion.\n\nHowever, she was among those most willing to see Zhou Ze strive hard and not become a \"salted fish\"^3.\n\nIt was very much like a wife looking at her good-for-nothing husband.\n\nScolding and berating him, telling him to look at how hard other people's husbands worked, while he only knew how to stay home and \"eat soft rice\"^4, showing no ambition; but after the scolding, she still had to check if he'd starved to death.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. He no longer bothered hailing a taxi and just said:\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"That person who used to run an underworld store in Rongcheng, you know them, right?\"\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense.\"\n\n\"He became much stronger than before.\" When Little Loli spoke of that person, it seemed to stir up the nightmarish memories of that rainy night in Rongcheng, and her expression turned serious. \"If you can find him, you could ask him. Of course, his method might not suit you, because there's a big difference between you two.\"\n\nBack then, the ghost messengers of Rongcheng were the first to discover him.\n\nUnder the pursuit of the ghost messengers, that person clearly could only flee with his head in his hands at first, completely powerless to retaliate.\n\nIn fact, if the ghost messengers in Rongcheng hadn't initially been played for fools by that boy who seemed able to see through even ghosts' thoughts, that person should have been apprehended long ago.\n\nThat boy was also killed because of that incident.\n\nGhost messengers rarely killed people, or perhaps one could say they dared not kill, but that boy was still killed, because he could deceive even ghosts. His eyes seemed capable of seeing through and discerning everything.\n\nAnd then, that man, who had previously only been able to flee, voluntarily returned.\n\nWhile those around him were being captured one by one, or injured and fleeing, he returned.\n\nAfterwards, it was that bloody night: souls burned, everyone slaughtered each other, and what littered the ground were, ghost messenger badges.\n\nAs she spoke, Little Loli kicked a small stone in front of her. She didn't want to recall that scene, but she continued:\n\n\"I remember the Faceless Woman spoke of you in front of me. Her appraisal of you was very high, terrifyingly high even. I didn't understand what she meant before, but now I sort of do. Actually, there's another method, more suitable for you, and it will definitely work.\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"You are a wisp of consciousness born from that powerful entity while it was in a coma, and you've formed an independent self-personality, even possessing a soul-like form of existence. That old hag called you nothing more than a guard dog, you might as well acknowledge it first.\"\n\nZhou Ze fell into thought. He seemed to have understood something.\n\n\"You're a guard dog, you're a gatekeeper, and you're guarding a huge treasure trove of wealth! You can… embezzle^5!\"\n\nEmbezzle!\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched subconsciously.\n\n\"Isn't he still incomplete? Isn't he still unconscious? Isn't he still fragmented? This is precisely your opportunity! His power, his abilities, his innate divine abilities!\"\n\nAs she spoke, Little Loli proactively grabbed Zhou Ze's hand and, bending his fingers, said:\n\n\"For example, this black fingernail—this is a manifestation of your embezzlement! You've already unconsciously completed a part of it. Even if it's just a small part, it's actually been enough for you to protect yourself for a long time, and even sustain your duties as a ghost messenger. You can steal more, you can pilfer more! Steal all of his, or steal half! If you just steal half, do you still need to be afraid of him waking up? To be even more extreme, back when you were just a temporary ghost messenger, you had the courage to entertain the thought of replacing me in your heart. Now, you don't dare to replace him? You are Zhou Ze, you are an independent personality, you are a human! Why can't you?\"\n\nAfter hearing these words, Zhou Ze looked at his fingers again and nodded silently.\n\nYes, instead of asking others for methods to cultivate and become stronger, he clearly had a \"scripture library\"^6, similar to Shaolin Temple's, right beside him, and the key to its door was still in his hand. Why bother looking far and wide when something is close at hand?\n\n\"Whether you take it or not, these things are all here now; if you don't take them, they're not yours either. If you take them, they are yours. Leaving them here is also a waste.\"\n\nLittle Loli's voice carried a hint of instigation, \"So, take them, move them back to your own home, then they'll truly be yours.\"\n\n\"But if he wakes up and replaces me, wouldn't that be more beneficial for you?\" Zhou Ze looked at Little Loli and asked.\n\n\"I'm just a ghost messenger.\" Little Loli smiled. \"If that thing inside you fully awakens, in his eyes, I'm nothing. He probably wouldn't even mind swallowing me along with you when he devours you, after all, my soul blood is also in your hands.\"\n\nThis explanation, made sense.\n\n\"I understand,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"From now on, take a small fraction of your precious time spent sunbathing, reading newspapers, and drinking coffee, and give it a try,\" Little Loli continued to persuade him.\n\nLike an anxious and exhausted mother, trying her best to persuade her good-for-nothing, brain-damaged son to show a little ambition.\n\n\"Oh, and one more question.\" Zhou Ze looked at Little Loli in front of him. \"You just said quite a lot.\"\n\n(It was) all for you, wasn't it.\n\n\"Can you tell me what you did before you died?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"An entrepreneur, a female entrepreneur,\" Little Loli answered directly.\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"I made my fortune by privatizing state-owned enterprises and embezzling state assets.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly realized, no wonder this girl was so skilled at persuading him to embezzle just now.\n\n………………\n\nTaking a taxi back to the bookstore, Zhou Ze spent the whole ride thinking about how to \"embezzle\" from himself.\n\nThe treasure mountain was before him, and he had the key to its grand gate because he could actively awaken it. However, he didn't know how to transport the gold, silver, and treasures from there into his own home.\n\nThis was a very vexing problem, a bit like that night when the Faceless Woman disguised herself as Doctor Lin to seduce him. Willing but powerless.\n\nAfter getting out of the car, it was already evening. The lights were on inside the store, and then, there were many people in the bookstore.\n\nYes, many people.\n\nAccording to Boss Zhou's memory, his bookstore hadn't been this lively in a long time.\n\nWalking into the bookstore, he saw mostly young people who looked like students, both male and female. They sat quietly in their seats, looking at the books in front of them and at their notebooks. A few of them had slightly moving lips, likely reciting English words.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit confused.\n\nTonight, business was really good.\n\nHe was too used to hard times, so he was being cheap, perhaps.\n\nXu Qinglang sat by the counter. When Zhou Ze approached, Xu Qinglang shrugged and said, \"How about it, isn't business surprisingly good tonight?\"\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\nSo many ghosts suddenly showing up meant so much performance, and Boss Zhou felt a bit unaccustomed to it.\n\n\"When dawn breaks, the college entrance exam begins.\"\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette, exhaled a smoke ring, and continued: \"These are all student spirits. They don't know they're dead, but they still think they have their college entrance exam tomorrow, so they've come here to study for it.\"\n\n\"That many?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, and there are also those who failed the college entrance exam in the past and committed suicide by jumping off buildings.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe two grown men sat together by the counter, smoking.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to collect these people into the Gate of Hell for merit points, because they were all studying very intently and diligently. Zhou Ze temporarily didn't want to disturb them.\n\n\"My grades were never good since I was little,\" Xu Qinglang lamented. \"I never experienced the college entrance exam.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said:\n\n\"When I was in school, those who were pretty in class generally didn't have very good grades.\"\n\n\"…………\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"What about you? Your grades must have been good, right? A top student? Otherwise, you wouldn't have become a genius surgeon, would you?\"\n\n\"You can look up the records. I was the top science student in Tongcheng that year.\"\n\nXu Qinglang paused for a moment, \"Oh, I didn't see that coming, you're a straight-A student, huh.\"\n\n\"What's a straight-A student? In the end, I still turned into a ghost.\"\n\nAt the bookstore entrance, another customer walked in. It was a woman, plainly dressed.\n\nShe was an acquaintance, who had come to the store before.\n\n\"You've changed locations, haven't you? I had quite a time finding you,\" the woman said.\n\n\"Oh, please have a seat first. You can be on your way later,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing to a nearby chair.\n\n\"Ah, alright.\"\n\nThe woman sat down.\n\nShe had visited Zhou Ze's bookstore before, coming in with the rich girl who had lost her Corgi.\n\nBut back then, she said she needed to accompany her son for this year's college entrance exam, so Zhou Ze gave her a pass, letting her leave and not sending her to Hell.\n\nDawn was breaking, and the college entrance exam was about to begin. Her accompanying duty was over, so, as per their agreement, she came to report.\n\n\"Aren't you waiting until the results are out before coming? At least you could see which university your son got into,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What's there to see? As a mother, all I could do was this much: staying with him every night as he revised until late, watching over him when he fell asleep. His father is careless, so I had to occasionally tell his father in dreams what the child should eat tomorrow, what to supplement him with and so on. He took the college entrance exam. Whether he scored high or low, good or bad, no matter which school he gets into, I don't care anymore. He has his own life, his own path to walk. It's just a college entrance exam; his life has just begun, and the road ahead is very, very long. It's not something a single college entrance exam can entirely decide. In the future, he still has to work hard and strive for himself.\"\n\n\"It's good that you see it that way,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nThey sat like this, almost until dawn, the bookstore's closing time today was much later than usual.\n\nThe time was about right.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, first opened the Gate of Hell, then clapped his hands and shouted to the students in the bookstore who had also been revising all night:\n\n\"It's college entrance exam time! Students, come to me to collect your admission tickets. I wish you all, a smooth journey.\"\n\nBeside him, Xu Qinglang brought out the pastries and glutinous rice dumplings that he had hastily prepared in the latter half of the night, and shouted to the student spirits who had stood up:\n\n\"Before you go on your way, each of you take one rice cake and one rice dumpling before you leave. Uncle wishes you, 'Gao Zong'^7!\"\n___\n^1 擦P股 (cā pìgǔ): Literally \"to wipe one's butt,\" meaning to clean up a mess or cover for someone's mistakes.\n^2 一荣俱荣一损俱损 (yī róng jù róng yī sǔn jù sǔn): An idiom meaning to share prosperity and adversity; to rise and fall together.\n^3 咸鱼 (xiányú): Literally \"salted fish,\" an idiom referring to someone who is unmotivated, lazy, or resigned to their fate.\n^4 吃软饭 (chī ruǎnfàn): Literally \"to eat soft rice,\" an idiom meaning to live off a woman, or to be a kept man.\n^5 监守自盗 (jiānshǒu zìdào): Literally \"to steal what one guards,\" meaning embezzlement or pilfering from one's own trust.\n^6 藏经阁 (cángjīnggé): Literally \"Sutra Repository,\" often associated with Buddhist temples like Shaolin Temple, where ancient scriptures and martial arts manuals are stored, symbolizing a treasure trove of knowledge or power.\n^7 糕粽 (gāo zòng): A pun. 糕 (gāo) means \"cake\" and 粽 (zòng) means \"rice dumpling.\" Together, they sound like 高中 (gāo zhōng), which means \"high school,\" but in this context, it's a blessing for \"high scores\" or \"getting into a good high school/college.\" It’s a homophone blessing often used for students taking important exams.",

    "content": "Zhou Boss truly reaped a huge harvest today, arguably the biggest he'd had in a long time. Whether it was performance points or underworld banknotes, he certainly made a tidy sum this time.\n\nAfter all, no matter the time or the industry, students' money is always the easiest to earn.\n\nAfter sending this batch of student souls on their way, Zhou Ze took a shower, then went upstairs to get some rest. Bai Yingying had already made the bed and had long since washed herself clean and fragrant, waiting.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the bedside but didn't rush to get into bed; instead, he stood by the window and lit a cigarette.\n\nXu Qinglang knew Zhou Ze had this habit and would laughingly say that while others enjoyed their post-coital cigarettes, Zhou Boss preferred his pre-coital ones.\n\nHowever, today Zhou Boss smoked several \"pre-coital cigarettes\" in a row.\n\nLying in bed, Bai Yingying, who had long since gotten into position, found it strange. She was almost at the point of shouting:\n\n\"Boss, come on, come on...\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, saw Yingying, smiled, and said, \"Sorry, I was very sleepy initially, but now I'm not anymore.\"\n\nWith that, he lit another cigarette.\n\nBai Yingying got out of bed, brought Zhou Ze a chair to sit on, and then stood behind him, massaging his shoulders, gently asking:\n\n\"Boss, what are you thinking about?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Instead, he silently spread open his hands. Ten black fingernails slowly grew out, and wisps of black mist constantly swirled and brewed between them.\n\nBai Yingying's body trembled several times in a row. She had an instinctive fear of Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\n\"Tell me, besides these grey nails, what else do I have left?\"\n\nZhou Ze seemed to be asking Bai Yingying, yet also seemed to be talking to himself.\n\nThe Little Loli had given Zhou Ze the suggestion of \"embezzlement.\"\n\nSo now, Zhou Ze began to genuinely ponder this question:\n\nHow to steal,\n\nHow to do it,\n\nHow to steal in a way that wouldn't arouse the slightest suspicion from the authorities, wouldn't provoke backlash or accountability, and might even earn him their gratitude.\n\nThis was a profound art.\n\nBai Yingying didn't quite grasp her boss's meaning. Since she didn't understand, she didn't ask further and focused on massaging him.\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang. It was the Little Loli.\n\n\"Hello, what is it?\"\n\nThey had just met and talked the night before, so for her to call again at this time, Zhou Ze found it a little strange.\n\n\"Minor thing. A Ghost Messenger from Changzhou has business that will take him through Tongcheng. He gave me a heads-up, so I'm letting you know.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe call ended.\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his temples, then sank back into contemplation.\n\nHumans possess a natural capacity for imitation. This ability, from its rawest form, cannot evolve beyond a single step: it is 'learning'.\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Zhou Ze slowly closed his eyes. In his mind, he began to recall the sensation of that consciousness within him awakening.\n\nThe best form of theft,\n\nIs, in fact, imitation.\n\nAs a scholar, can it even be called stealing?^[1]^\n\nWhat's more, after all is said and done, it was all his own stuff anyway.\n\nBai Yingying noticed her boss's breathing slowly deepening and lengthening. She thought he had fallen asleep and gradually began to lessen the pressure of her massage.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't actually asleep; his mind was still very clear. He had merely temporarily cast aside his distracting thoughts and began to wholeheartedly immerse himself in that state.\n\nThe first time he had entered that state,\n\nWas on the rooftop of a tall building, facing the Green-Clad Lady;\n\nHe had been swaying back and forth ceaselessly on the edge of the rooftop, teetering on the brink of life and death;\n\nAfter that, it was at the Lin family's, during the fight with his sister-in-law's Ghost Messenger soul; and then in places like Yancheng and General Mountain.\n\nEach time,\n\nWhen that consciousness awakened,\n\nThat overbearing aura that looked down on everything,\n\nThat absolute confidence,\n\nThat feeling as if everything was within his grasp,\n\nZhou Ze was slowly trying to conjure up those emotions from those times.\n\nAnd then,\n\nBai Yingying, who was still slowly massaging Zhou Ze beside him, suddenly froze. She saw Zhou Ze's skin slowly shriveling, and the aura around him became increasingly restrained, to the point where it felt as if she couldn't perceive any trace of him being alive.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze's fingernails began to grow longer, emitting an eerie luster. The surrounding air slowly grew oppressive, as if everything had fallen into a state of stasis.\n\nBai Yingying's little heart pounded \"thump-thump-thump\". The primal oppression emanating from him was almost unbearable for her; she even felt an urge to kneel.\n\nThis was the first time Bai Yingying had been so close to Zhou Ze in this state. Previously, she had always been the one to take care of him after he became paralyzed.\n\n\"Boss... Boss...\"\n\nZhou Ze remained with his eyes closed, still meticulously pursuing and searching for that sensation. To the point where, perhaps because he was too deeply immersed, Zhou Ze himself was completely unaware of the changes happening to his body.\n\nHis fingernails grew longer and longer,\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's body became increasingly hunched.\n\nOriginally, he had been slumped lazily against the chair, in a posture reminiscent of Ge You's famous \"slump\",^[2]^ as this made it more comfortable and convenient for Bai Yingying to massage him.\n\nNow,\n\nZhou Ze's body was like a deflated balloon, beginning to shrink, as if a person entering old age and losing body moisture.\n\nBut his fingernails,\n\nHad truly grown to an astonishing length.\n\nZhou Ze's hands were hanging down onto his knees,\n\nBut now his fingernails,\n\nHad grown long enough to touch the ground, easily several decimeters in length, almost usable as sickles.\n\nMoreover, his originally black fingernails now even had a dark red luster flowing through them.\n\n\"Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...\"\n\nThe tips of his ten fingernails touched the tile floor, scraping out a shower of sparks. The tiles actually seemed to melt, leaving deep indentations.\n\nBai Yingying stared dumbfounded,\n\nSo thick,\n\nSo long,\n\nSo hard!\n\nIf he were to poke someone with these,\n\nWho could possibly endure it!\n\n*Eeek! Eeek! Eeek! Eeek! Eeek!*\n\nZhou Ze was completely oblivious to his maid's reaction beside him. He still didn't realize he had unconsciously unlocked a new 'stance'.\n\nIt looked simple.\n\nBut in reality, without the Little Loli's words from earlier in the day, Zhou Ze would never have thought of doing this. Perhaps it was a case of being too close to see clearly.\n\nBut at least, for now, it was remarkably effective.\n\n\"Hummmmm...\"\n\nHowever,\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was still immersed in this feeling of 'recollection',\n\nHis body suddenly trembled slightly.\n\nBai Yingying, who was still admiring its thickness and length, instantly sharpened her gaze. She sensed a violent change occurring in her boss's aura.\n\nBy some unseen force,\n\nZhou Ze felt his consciousness sinking into a swamp filled with viscous liquid. When he realized what was happening, he tried to open his eyes and awaken from his meditation, but found he simply couldn't.\n\n\"Crack, crack, crack...\"\n\nZhou Ze's body began to tremble violently.\n\nEven the chair began to crack,\n\nThen it directly burst apart, scattering fragments everywhere.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, despite having no chair beneath him, remained in a seated posture, not falling down at all.\n\nBecause his body's weight and balance were entirely supported by those ten fingernails,\n\nA very bizarre posture,\n\nA very incongruous sight.\n\nZhou Ze's eyelids began to tremble wildly, as if he were engaged in a fierce struggle.\n\nThat consciousness,\n\nThat consciousness, surprisingly, had been unintentionally triggered while he was 'recollecting'?\n\nThis seemed to be an inevitable trend. Zhou Ze had never tried to stop it when it was about to awaken, because each time he had allowed it to awaken, it had been by his own volition.\n\nWhen he encountered a critical situation,\n\nNeeding a more powerful force,\n\nZhou Ze would actively summon its awakening and borrow its power.\n\nHowever, this time,\n\nZhou Ze was not acting on his own initiative.\n\nFurthermore, Zhou Ze knew clearly that if he had truly encountered absolute danger, summoning it out would be acceptable—it would simply be choosing the lesser of two evils. But now he was about to go to sleep, right here in the bookstore,\n\nWhy awaken it for no reason at all?\n\nThis was like doing business and suffering a terrible loss; the expenditure and the gain were completely incomparable.\n\nRestrain,\n\nRestrain,\n\nRestrain!\n\nZhou Ze slowly tilted his head back.\n\nHe was exerting all his strength to suppress the awakening of that consciousness, struggling to regain control over his own body.\n\nYou,\n\nGet back,\n\nGo back!\n\n\"Crack-crackle-crackle...\"\n\nIn the next room, Xu Qinglang, who was lying in bed reading a book for his bedtime reading, suddenly noticed that the lights in the room seemed to have a problem, flickering on and off.\n\nIn Old Dao's room, Monkey immediately jumped off the bed, chattering \"Squeak, squeak, squeak!\"\n\nOld Dao was sleeping like a log, tightly clamping the quilt between his legs as he turned over and continued to sleep.\n\nMeanwhile, the Death Attendant, who had been sitting on the bed in the same room as Old Dao all night,\n\nImmediately knelt on the floor.\n\nAs the ancient saying goes, \"When the Drought Demon appears, a thousand *li* of land turn barren.\"^[3]^ Of course, the commotion caused by Zhou Ze couldn't be as exaggerated as \"a thousand *li* of barren land,\" but his immediate surroundings and the people nearby were all clearly affected.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nA suppressed sound emanated from Zhou Ze's throat.\n\nHe felt as if he were in a tug-of-war,\n\nAnd the prize of this tug-of-war was whether the key to this door could still hang at his waist.\n\nIf the other party could still awaken and seize control of this body against his will, it would mean that the other party had already gained absolute initiative.\n\nCrisp cracking sounds came from his joints.\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head.\n\nThe veins in his neck bulged.\n\nHis mouth opened, letting out a silent roar,\n\nAt that moment, the windows of several rooms on the bookstore's second floor, including television and computer screens, collectively shattered.\n\nAfter all this passed,\n\nZhou Ze's body swayed for a moment, but he still stabilized himself by relying on the fingernails dug into the floor.\n\n\"Gasp... gasp...\"\n\nHis mouth was wide open, and he panted ceaselessly.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes.\n\nIn his eyes,\n\nThere was still clarity.\n\nBut cold sweat had already drenched Zhou Ze's entire body,\n\nHe was terrified.\n\nBecause just now, Zhou Ze had clearly sensed that the other party seemed to know his intentions and had launched a counterattack!\n\nAlthough he had suppressed it this time, he would truly have to weigh his options carefully before attempting to steal anything using the same method again.\n\nHowever,\n\nWhen Zhou Ze's eyes landed on his ten fingernails, now long enough to be broken off and given to farmers as sickles for cutting wheat,\n\nA smile still appeared at the corner of his mouth.\n\nAt least,\n\nThis round,\n\nWas no loss at all.\n\n---\n^[1]^ This is a reference to a famous line from Lu Xun's \"The True Story of Ah Q,\" where the protagonist justifies stealing books by saying, \"How can a scholar's matter be considered stealing?\" It's a sarcastic way of re-framing unethical actions.\n^[2]^ **Ge You's famous \"slump\"**: Refers to a popular meme image of Chinese actor Ge You slumped lazily on a sofa in the 1993 TV series \"I Love My Family,\" symbolizing a state of listlessness or extreme relaxation.\n^[3]^ **\"When the Drought Demon appears, a thousand *li* of land turn barren\"**: An ancient Chinese proverb (旱魃一出，赤地千里 - Hànbá yī chū, chìdì qiānlǐ) referring to a mythical drought-causing demon. A *li* is a traditional Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters. The proverb signifies widespread devastation.",

    "content": "\"The Great Compendium of Salted Fish,\" Column 1, Chapter 1, Article 1:\n\n\"One must learn to be content.\"\n\nAs a man determined to become the King of Salted Fish,\nafter Boss Zhou waved his \"new claws\" a few times, like a child giggling to himself upon receiving a new toy, he soon retracted them, went downstairs to take another shower, and then went to sleep soundly, embracing the maid Bai.\n\nThis kind of \"internal theft\"[1] was truly dangerous, especially since the consciousness within him also felt aversion towards it and even began to resist, though Zhou Ze fortunately suppressed it back in the end.\n\nBut from another perspective, this feeling was truly stimulating.\nBoss Zhou felt as if he had \"pulled off a trick\"[2], and with the mindset of having already made a profit, this sleep was exceptionally sweet.\n\nPerhaps it was due to overexertion the previous night, as Zhou Ze didn't wake up until the afternoon. After getting up, he found many parts of his body aching, much like the aftermath of someone who rarely exercises suddenly getting a whim to loudly declare a diet and grit their teeth through a workout.\n\nAs a former doctor, Zhou Ze naturally knew this was due to excessive lactic acid secretion, and he didn't give it much thought. He leisurely went down to wash up as usual, and then sat down on the first floor.\n\nBai Yingying immediately brought him tea and the day's newspaper.\nThe newspaper had been specially ironed beforehand by Bai Yingying.\n\nFor a long time, servants would iron newspapers for nobles before they read them. This was because old printing techniques were poor, and ironing prevented fingers from getting stained with ink when turning pages. While this issue no longer exists, Bai Yingying liked the sense of ritual.\nZhou Ze let her be.\n\nNowadays, under Bai Yingying's meticulous care, Boss Zhou greatly resembled a Qing Dynasty nobleman who would go out every morning with a birdcage to walk his bird.\n\nOld Taoist was watching the news, sitting next to the bar, with Monkey in his lap. He was picking lice from Monkey while watching the news.\nActually, Monkey was very clean and knew how to groom himself, but Old Taoist was just used to the feeling. It didn't matter if he found any lice; Monkey's fur was soft and felt really good to the touch, and kneading it was very comfortable.\nMonkey also enjoyed it, resting his small head against Old Taoist's chest, a look of contentment on his face.\n\nThe idle state of the man and the monkey was even more decadent and languid than the government offices where common folk imagined people drinking tea and reading newspapers all day.\n\n\"Yo, Boss, this celebrity committed suicide.\"\nOld Taoist pointed at the TV screen and called out to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Who?\"\nZhou Ze didn't even lift his head; he wasn't interested in entertainment news.\n\n\"That male singer who sings '%￥@@#'.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\nHe knew the song, but not the person.\n\n\"At dawn, he exposed his own infidelity on Weibo, also revealed his drug use, and furthermore, confessed he was gay. Wow, what the hell, he must have achieved enlightenment and become a Buddha, right?\nHe aired all his dirty laundry online, then jumped from the hotel building to commit suicide. Tsk tsk, this humble Taoist quite liked a few of his songs.\"\nAs he spoke, Old Taoist reached out and stroked Monkey's fur.\n\"Monkey likes it too; he often plays this song on his phone.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\nBoss Zhou continued to enjoy the comfortable experience brought by the ironed newspaper; he really had no interest in this kind of news.\n\nDead people,\nhe had seen too many.\nMen, women, tall, short, plump or slender, beautiful and intelligent, scumbags, good husbands, and so on—\nin Boss Zhou's eyes, they had almost become Nanjing salted ducks on an assembly line,\narriving naked, routinely packaged, and then sent to hell for reception.\n\nIt's said that some forensic doctors like to sleep where they work because it gives them a sense of warm companionship. Perhaps there's truly nothing wrong with their psychology; after all, humans are creatures highly adaptable to habits.\n\n\"Huh, wait a minute.\"\nOld Taoist pulled out his phone and scrolled through it again, exclaiming with surprise:\n\"Boss, this singer had a commercial performance in Tongcheng yesterday! He jumped from the top floor of the Tongcheng Grand Hotel.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\nFor a long time, the Tongcheng Grand Hotel was a landmark building in the hearts of the people of Tongcheng. Over ten years ago, Tongcheng residents liked to boast that they had eaten at the Tongcheng Grand Hotel the day before.\n\nOld Taoist grew increasingly excited, completely ignoring his boss's perfunctory replies, and continued:\n\"Boss, do you think he'll come to our bookstore tonight?\nI need to prepare the ox tears[3]! If he comes, we might even get to hear him sing a song live.\"\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head and glanced at Old Taoist.\n\"Not all dead people come to our bookstore.\"\nZhou Ze reminded him.\n\nIf all dead people had to come to the bookstore, then the bookstore's GDP would be truly terrifying. Boss Zhou would be so busy he wouldn't even have time to drink coffee, and probably surpassing chief constables and even patrol inspectors wouldn't be a dream.\nBut in reality, most departed souls go to hell by themselves; only a small minority of disobedient souls are sent to hell through the bookstore channel.\n\n\"Boss, I think he has a great grievance! Look, he exposed all his dark history right before he died, and then committed suicide. There must be a huge injustice here!\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So he might really come to the bookstore tonight!\"\nOld Taoist was full of star-chasing fervor.\n\nTo be honest,\nOld Taoist's method of star-chasing, to a certain extent, could be said to have completely outdone the famous \"Sister Hongqiao\"[4].\nYou block airport entrances, I block the gates of hell.\n\n\"Want to chase stars? I actually know a place with a lot of celebrities, including ones I really like, like Zhang Rongmeifang.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Old Taoist asked, surprised.\n\n\"Yep, quickly find a rope and hang yourself. I'll be responsible for sending your soul to hell. Maybe you'll even make it to their underground concert.\"\n\n\"............\" Old Taoist.\n\nThat evening, Xu Qinglang prepared another grand feast. For the first time, Boss Zhou ceremoniously took out his cherished Underworld Flower[5] Brand Juice, took a careful sip, and then felt his appetite greatly stimulated. He truly had a hearty meal!\n\nThe others at the table looked at Boss Zhou much like they had looked at the old granny from the Bridge of Helplessness[6] ravenously devouring food the day before.\n\nIndeed,\nliving conditions in hell were poor,\nlook how hungry these ghosts were.\n\nAfter the meal,\nBoss Zhou, feeling rather full, simply moved a chair and sat down at the bookstore entrance. Riding on the lingering effects of the Underworld Flower's potency, Zhou Ze took the candied fruit brought by Bai Yingying and continued to eat.\n\nDining happily,\nenjoying the wonderful feeling of food,\nthis long-lost happiness—\nif Boss Zhou hadn't deliberately held back and suppressed it, he might have cried at the dinner table.\n\nXu Qinglang walked to the shop entrance, lit a cigarette, and looked a bit dejected.\nThis meal today marked the impending withdrawal of Xu Qinglang's series of juice beverages, primarily featuring plum juice, from the market.\nWithout speaking or exchanging words, Xu Qinglang returned to the bookstore to busy himself after finishing his cigarette.\n\nBoss Zhou comfortably enjoyed the last vestiges of evening bustle on South Street,\nwhile also pondering whether to spend some time practicing with the scythe-claws that appeared yesterday to get familiar with them, or to \"pull off another trick.\"\nThe latter impulse was quickly suppressed by Zhou Ze. \"Forget it, don't bite off more than you can chew,\" he thought, \"let's take it slow.\"\n\nA small sedan stopped in front of the bookstore. The car window rolled down, and Zhou Ze saw a man wearing a blue skirt sitting inside... a man!\nThe candied fruit in his throat immediately got stuck, and Zhou Ze began to cough.\n\nThe person turned their face, looked at Zhou Ze, showing a slight dissatisfaction in their expression, but said nothing.\nTaking out their phone, as if re-calibrating, they finally looked at Zhou Ze again before pushing open the car door and getting out.\n\nOnly when the person got out did Zhou Ze realize he might have been mistaken earlier. The person was wearing a sophisticated black suit jacket; perhaps they had draped a woman's skirt over themselves while driving in the car.\nBefore the person even approached, a powerful fragrance wafted over — the scent of perfume, very pungent and rich.\n\nIn this situation, Zhou Ze really wanted to call Xu Qinglang out for a \"comparison.\"\n\"You've met your match!\"\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze quickly noticed the difference. Old Xu was straight, with no issues in his functions or interests in that regard; his feminine features were natural. The person before him, on the other hand, exuded an air of affectation. Moreover, as a seasoned surgeon, Zhou Ze could tell that the person's face had likely undergone many operations; they had forcibly restructured themselves to give off a feminine aura.\n\n\"Having arrived at your esteemed location, allow me to greet you. My name is Liu Chuyu, a newly appointed ghost messenger from Changzhou. I am here tonight to detain a departed soul and take it back.\"\nThe person extended a hand to Zhou Ze, intending to shake hands, but had placed a handkerchief in their palm beforehand. The meaning was clear: they found Zhou Ze's hand dirty.\nBoss Zhou, who himself had germophobia, chuckled at the sight and couldn't be bothered to shake hands with this fellow. He directly asked:\n\"Lin Ke told me there was an out-of-bounds Changzhou ghost messenger coming here. What, taking ghosts from me, stealing business?\"\n\n\"I can compensate you in other ways. This departed soul is very important to me; I need to personally see him off, and there might be some unforeseen incidents along the way.\"\nThe person bent down, looking at Zhou Ze:\n\"If my attitude and demeanor make you uncomfortable, then I apologize beforehand.

I truly envy you.\"\n\n\"Hehe.\"\nZhou Ze had originally wanted to tell the other person that being stuck in the body of one's murderer wasn't exactly something to be envied,\nbut looking at the person in front of him again,\nhe suddenly felt that Xu Le still had his lovable qualities.\n\n---\n[1] \"Internal theft\": Literally \"guarding something only to steal it oneself,\" an idiom referring to a person entrusted with a task or property who then abuses that trust for personal gain.\n[2] \"Pulled off a trick\": Literally \"stolen a chicken,\" an idiom meaning to achieve something by cunning or stealth, often implying an unfair advantage or getting away with something.\n[3] \"ox tears\": In Chinese folklore, a mythical substance believed to allow one to see spirits or ghosts.\n[4] \"Sister Hongqiao\": A well-known super fan in China famous for her ability to spot and get close to celebrities at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport.\n[5] \"Underworld Flower\": Also known as *Lycoris radiata* or red spider lily.

    "content": "In the bookstore,\n\nLiu Chuyu sat in a spot, with tea and a fruit platter beside him. He didn't even pick up a book to feign reading; instead, he took out a compact mirror and started touching up his makeup.\n\nThe meticulousness, the affectation, the demeanor—\nTsk, tsk.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang saw this, he found himself somewhat unable to accept it. In the end, he simply opted for \"out of sight, out of mind,\" and went straight upstairs to rest.\n\nZhou Ze vaguely heard a very disdainful sound coming from Xu Qinglang, who had just gone up the stairs:\n\n\"Sao Huo.\"¹\n\nLaodao still sat serenely at the bar, holding a copy of *The Adventures of **** * and reading with great relish, occasionally fiddling with his crotch.\n\nPreviously, whenever Laodao had nothing to do, he would read *Bai Jie's Coaching Career*², having even finished reading the millions of words in the sequels, and reread them several times over.\n\nIn the end, Laodao even complained that the boss's \"borrowing a corpse to return a soul\"³ was too early. He should have let that damned Xu Le write a bit more, after all, this was a great undertaking that would benefit generations, and would even become the indelible mark of youth deep within generations.\n\nBai Yingying sat behind Zhou Ze, periodically refilling his hot tea, while meticulously poring over *The Self-Cultivation of a Maid* in her hands.\n\nAnd it was the Japanese version.\n\nZhou Ze was quite surprised that Bai Yingying had actually become self-taught in Japanese.\n\nBut then he thought about it and felt relieved. If a being who had lived for two hundred years showed no signs of physical or mental decline, her wisdom should be difficult to view with ordinary human eyes.\n\nAnd so, night gradually began to fall.\n\nLaodao was waiting for a soul of the deceased; he was waiting for that singer, hoping the singer's soul would come over to satisfy Laodao's peculiar fan-chasing needs.\n\nThat new Ghost Messenger from Changzhou, Liu Chuyu, was also waiting for his soul.\n\nZhou Ze stretched lazily, and looked up at the two of them. He wondered if they might be waiting for the same person?\n\nIt seemed,\nthere really was such a possibility.\n\nBut this colleague from next door, was he also a fan? Did he become a Ghost Messenger just to chase stars?\nHeh, heh, it couldn't be that extreme, could it?\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. A tall, lean man wearing a *douli*⁴ on his head walked in. The man held a bamboo pole, and surprisingly, was also wearing sunglasses.\n\nWearing sunglasses late at night, and that *douli*—really made one want to smash his head in.\n\nThe tall, lean man, who from head to toe exuded an aura of \"I'm showing off\" and \"I'm a master,\" found a seat by the window and sat down. He didn't call for tea, nor did he pick out a book from the shelves; he just sat upright and still, still wearing his sunglasses.\n\nLaodao, however, knew the ropes a bit. He casually poured a cup of mineral water and brought it over to him, while admonishing the show-off man:\n\n\"Minimum spend of one hundred yuan.\"\n\nAfter placing the water down, Laodao returned to the bar and continued reading his book.\n\nMonkey was bored, so he sidled up to Laodao, and started scratching Laodao's crotch as if looking for fleas.\n\nMonkey was small, and Laodao was sitting behind the bar, so Boss Zhou didn't see it. If Zhou Ze had seen it, he probably would've slapped Laodao directly across the face.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's memory, there was one scene he could never forget: Monkey standing outside the emergency room, pulling out his \"iron rod\" and furiously jerking it.\n\nNow, this little monkey was maintaining his initial innocence, which was quite good. Boss Zhou wouldn't just stand by and watch Laodao continue to lead the monkey astray.\n\nAfter the addition of one more person, the atmosphere in the bookstore became even quieter.\n\nNo one spoke, no one chatted. Everyone was busy with their own reading.\n\nZhou Ze simply narrowed his eyes and leaned back. Bai Yingying stood up and began massaging Zhou Ze's shoulders.\n\nHe waited, half-asleep, until about midnight. Outside, the wind began to pick up, and immediately after, the temperature seemed to drop a bit because of it.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head, a little puzzled, and looked out the window.\n\nBai Yingying muttered, “Boss, is this a ghost coming? What a grand entrance.”\n\nIndeed,\nthe wind had picked up,\na light rain had begun to fall,\nall that was missing was a BGM—it was exactly like a movie protagonist's entrance.\n\nBoss Zhou had sent countless ghosts on their way from this bookstore. Everyone else had \"quietly entered the village, without firing a shot\"⁵, but today was the first time he'd encountered such a high-profile situation.\n\nThe wind carried a ghostly aura. It was undeniably a ghost.\n\nNext, a BGM actually started playing too. A man outside was singing, singing a love song that was very popular in the nineties, his voice melodious, carrying a unique sense of vicissitude.\n\nLaodao immediately stood up, his face full of excitement!\nHoly crap,\nHe really came!\n\nLiu Chuyu remained motionless, continuing to gaze at his reflection in the mirror. He had maintained this posture and action for probably several hours now; the more he looked, the more he wanted to look, the more he found himself beautiful, completely lost in self-admiration.\n\nThe show-off man in the *douli* didn't move either. Since entering, he had been sitting upright and still. This \"vibe\" was truly a match for Deadpool, who was sitting there motionless. The two seemed to be competing.\n\nThe arriving guest certainly put on quite a show. First to enter, was a man in a burgundy suit. The man was singing passionately, his face pale.\n\nLaodao almost ran straight over to ask for an autograph. But then, behind the man, there was actually a woman. A woman in a red dress, and even her shoes were red high heels.\n\nOrdinary people couldn't see it, but Zhou Ze could. The red on this woman's body had already turned into a \"water-like\" liquid and was dripping down. Wherever she walked, there were faint traces of crimson left behind.\n\nLiu Chuyu finally stood up and walked over to the woman. His eyes were sharp as he looked at her.\n\nThe woman raised her head, looked at him, then smiled faintly, spread her hands, and said:\n\n\"Ghost Messenger, I am here as per our agreement. Please bind me and send me to hell.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu pursed his lips, appearing somewhat angry.\n\nZhou Ze could understand why this new colleague was angry. Perhaps Liu Chuyu and this female ghost had some agreement before, just like he himself had with that woman who accompanied her son while he studied for the *Gaokao*⁶.\n\nBut now the result was: the woman had become a vengeful ghost.\nVengeful ghosts do not qualify to re-enter hell for reincarnation.\n\nIt was like fresh fruit that could have sold for a good price had already rotted away. Forget selling it; one would even be afraid of getting a stomachache from eating it.\n\n\"Release him! You can't go to hell; just disperse. He still can. Release your hold on him, and I'll send him to hell.”\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nBai Yingying opened her mouth, clearly dissatisfied, intending to say something, but Zhou Ze reached out and grabbed her wrist, signaling her to keep quiet.\n\nZhou Ze knew what Bai Yingying wanted to complain about: *You came looking for a female ghost, and after finding out she'd become a vengeful ghost and couldn't be converted into merit points, you actually thought about sending the male ghost down instead. This is Tongcheng, my boss's territory. What do you mean by coming here to steal business?*\n\n\"I want to be with him.\"\n\nThe female ghost's hand was tightly clasped with the male ghost's. The male ghost looked bewildered, while the female ghost's eyes were full of deep affection.\n\nNow *this* is what you call a die-hard fan, damn it. So fervent that even if I die, and become a ghost, I'll take you to hell with me.\n\nLaodao had said earlier today that the male singer's death was a bit unusual. Before his death, he had exposed all his past scandals himself, and then jumped off a building. It seems he must have been influenced by a ghostly entity.\n\nZhou Ze's mind slightly sharpened. A ghostly entity had killed someone in his Tongcheng. This was no small matter.\n\n\"You debased yourself, and now you're dragging him down with you. Don't be shameless!\" Liu Chuyu stared at the female ghost, speaking word by word.\n\nThe female ghost was somewhat bashful, and also somewhat resentful, but she still knelt before Liu Chuyu, crying and pleading:\n\n\"Your Excellency, I beg you, if he walks the Yellow Springs Road with me, I won't feel lonely.”\n\n\"Yellow Springs Road? Do you think you still have a chance to go to the Yellow Springs? Now, release him! I'll send him down. You've already made him miserable enough.”\n\n\"But I had three abortions for him, I gave him everything! I love him, I love him more than my own family. I've wronged my family. Now, I just want him to be with me, even if it's in hell together!”\n\nThe female ghost seemed to be somewhat insane. Of course, if you weren't insane and your obsession wasn't profound, you wouldn't have become a vengeful ghost.\n\n\"Get out of my way!\" Liu Chuyu flipped over the mirror he had been fiddling with while sitting there. A beam of purple light shot out, striking the female ghost directly. The female ghost fell heavily to the ground, her soul significantly weakened.\n\nImmediately after, Liu Chuyu grabbed the male singer's soul.\n\n\"No, no, please, Your Excellency, no, no!!!\"\n\nThe female ghost pleaded desperately, her hands gripping Liu Chuyu's legs, and Liu Chuyu was surprisingly unable to move because of it.\n\nZhou Ze, who had been contentedly acting as a \"bystander\" from the start, finally showed a look of realization on his face. Earlier, Zhou Ze had wondered to himself why this new colleague from next door had specifically come all the way to Tongcheng to apprehend a female ghost. Even if this female ghost had become a vengeful ghost, it wasn't that important, really; it would have been the same if Tongcheng's Ghost Messengers had dealt with her when she came here.\n\nThe crux of the matter was that even after her soul body was injured, the female ghost could still restrain a Ghost Messenger's movements!\n\nThis was absolutely no ordinary female ghost. To be precise, it wasn't that this female ghost had undergone some abnormal transformation after death, but rather that this woman, while alive, was anything but ordinary!\n\nThis was a big fish⁷ indeed.\n\nIn reality, there were people like the \"Pockmarked Monk\" who possessed profound mystical abilities. Actually, Xu Qinglang could also be considered one of them, but his abilities were only \"half-bucket\"⁸ strong. Laodao's ancestors must have also been well-off at some point, otherwise, it would have been impossible to leave behind such useful talismans, and like wholesale cabbage⁹, Laodao had one after another.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. He still didn't move. If the female ghost hadn't turned into a vengeful ghost, Boss Zhou might have tried to strong-arm the situation.\n\nHowever, while Zhou Ze didn't move, the tall, lean man with the *douli* on his head, who seemed desperate to tell the whole world \"I'm showing off,\" slowly stood up.\n\nHe took off his *douli*, revealing a balding head. His pair of triangular eyes gave people a very sly and narrow-minded impression.\n\nLooking at the female ghost desperately clinging to Liu Chuyu's leg and pleading, and at Liu Chuyu, who was continuously striking and scolding the female ghost with his mirror, the tall, lean man took a deep breath, and said in a deep voice:\n\n\"This is too much, you damned Ghost Messengers.\"\n\n\"…………\" Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou, who had been sitting on the side without saying a word or making a move, had a look of \"Black Man Question Mark\"¹⁰ on his face?\n\nThis truly was a case of,\na person sitting at home,\nand a pot falling from the sky¹¹.\n\n***\n\n¹ **Sao Huo (骚货):** A highly derogatory slang term, typically used to insult someone (often a woman, but can be used for men in a gender-bending/effeminate context) as \"slutty,\" \"whore-like,\" or \"provocative.\" In this context, given Liu Chuyu's affected behavior, it implies an extreme disdain for his showy, effeminate, or pretentious manner.\n² **Bai Jie's Coaching Career (白洁的执教生涯):** A famous Chinese erotica novel.\n³ **Borrowing a corpse to return a soul (借屍還魂):** An idiom in Chinese mythology and literature, referring to a soul or spirit possessing a dead body to return to life, or transmigrating into another body.\n⁴ **Douli (斗笠):** A traditional East Asian conical hat, often made of bamboo or straw.\n⁵ **Quietly entered the village, without firing a shot (悄悄地進村，打槍滴不要):** A famous Chinese military slogan/idiom, meaning to proceed stealthily and avoid detection.\n⁶ **Gaokao (高考):** China's national college entrance examination, renowned for its difficulty and importance.\n⁷ **Big fish (大鱼):** An idiom referring to an important person, a significant target, or a major gain.\n⁸ **Half-bucket strong (半桶水):** An idiom describing someone with shallow or incomplete knowledge/skill; literally \"half a bucket of water,\" implying that the bucket is not full.\n⁹ **Like wholesale cabbage (大白菜批發一樣):** An idiom meaning something is abundant, common, or cheap, like buying cabbage in bulk.\n¹⁰ **Black Man Question Mark (黑人问号):** Refers to the \"Confused Nick Young\" meme, often used to express confusion or bewilderment in internet culture.\n¹¹ **A person sitting at home, and a pot falling from the sky (人在家中坐，鍋從天上來):** An idiom meaning to be unexpectedly and wrongly implicated in trouble or to suffer a misfortune that has nothing to do with oneself.",

    "content": "Boss Zhou really wanted to stand up and curse.\n\nWhat did they mean, \"you bunch of ghost attendants\"?\n\nThis was *my* home.\n\nI was sitting in my own home,\n\nNot doing anything,\n\nNot saying anything,\n\nAnd they could still count me in?\n\nOf course, Boss Zhou wasn't so impulsive as to immediately jump out and start a confrontation. Their primary target was clearly Liu Chuyu, this newly promoted Changzhou ghost attendant. That pretentious man clearly had an extraordinary relationship with that woman.\n\nAs for these real-life cultivators, Zhou Ze truly wasn't very familiar with or knowledgeable about them. The Leprous Monk was eccentric with a severe case of chuunibyou, and the Old Daoist and Madame Xu weren't from orthodox backgrounds.\n\nWith Liu Chuyu ahead, scouting the way for him, Zhou Ze couldn't ask for more.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nThe female ghost was finally smacked away by Liu Chuyu. At the same time, his mirror suddenly rotated, flipped down, and directly pressed against the female ghost's face.\n\nThis was an attempt to directly shatter the vengeful spirit, forcefully making her \"find peace.\"\n\n\"Clink!\"\n\nThe lanky man's bamboo pole extended, striking the mirror. The mirror flew backward, directly landing on the bar counter.\n\n\"Clatter...\"\n\nAfter spinning once on the bar counter, the mirror clattered onto the floor, landing right in front of the Old Daoist and the monkey.\n\nEarlier, when Liu Chuyu made his move, the Old Daoist was squatting behind the bar, one hand clutching his crotch, the other gripping the bar's edge, like a soldier hiding in a trench, though this soldier was a bit trembling.\n\nBut suddenly,\n\nA windfall from heaven!\n\nThe Old Daoist looked at the mirror on the floor in front of him, his eyes turning green. Of course, he wasn't foolish enough to quickly pick up this item and return it to the esteemed Changzhou ghost attendant. Instead, he subconsciously reached out, wanting to clutch it to his chest.\n\nAnyway, his two previous ghost attendant bosses had killed quite a few people, so the Old Daoist, as a subordinate who merely cheered \"666\" from the sidelines, didn't have much reverence for these ghost attendants.\n\nHowever, as soon as the Old Daoist's hand touched the mirror, his palm instantly turned crimson. The Old Daoist let out a muffled groan and quickly pulled his hand back.\n\n\"Huu huu huu...\"\n\nBlowing continuously on his scalded palm, the Old Daoist felt a million alpacas stampeding through his mind.\n\nIn truth, the Old Daoist had thought too simply. How could a magical artifact used by a ghost attendant, especially one that had just been activated, be easily coveted by a mere mortal?\n\nThe monkey beside him darted forward two steps, extending its paw downward to grab it.\n\n\"Hey, don't...\"\n\nthe Old Daoist instinctively shouted.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!\"\n\nBut the monkey picked up the mirror and began playing with it.\n\nLooking at the monkey's unharmed paw,\n\nThen at his own current \"roasted pig's trotters,\"\n\nthe Old Daoist suddenly felt worse than a beast!\n\nAfter playing with it for a few turns, the monkey made to throw it to the Old Daoist. The Old Daoist, scared, frantically waved his hands, signaling it not to be impulsive.\n\n\"Monkey, I understand your filial piety, but this humble Daoist won't take it.\"\n\nThe monkey scratched its head in confusion, then pointed the mirror at itself.\n\nIn the mirror,\n\nwhat appeared was not a cute and innocent monkey face,\n\nbut rather a fierce-looking adult ape, with an air of malevolence, and a heavy, lustful craving emanating from between its brows!\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!!!!!\"\n\nThe monkey, scared, threw the mirror onto the ground,\n\nand plopped down onto the ground itself,\n\n\"What is this,\"\n\n\"Scared the roar out of me!\"\n\nOver there,\n\nthe lanky, pretentious man, after flipping the magical artifact from the ghost attendant's hand with a bamboo pole,\n\ndidn't stay cool for long.\n\nIn fact,\n\nZhou Ze's earlier conjecture of a tit-for-tat confrontation or even the newcomer gaining the upper hand didn't happen either.\n\nFrom the opponent's attire and wearing sunglasses at night, including his earlier action of including Zhou Ze, who was quietly \"eating melon\" on the side, into the \"taunt\" sequence,\n\nit could be seen that,\n\nthe opponent's intelligence was indeed a bit underdeveloped.\n\nThe current situation was that Liu Chuyu, despite having his mirror knocked away, hadn't disgraced his ghost attendant status. Losing a magical artifact didn't render him as useless as the Old Daoist. Instead, he quickly used his other methods to fiercely pin the lanky man to the ground and start rubbing him.\n\nThe lanky man was beaten black and blue. At first, he still threw out some tough talk, but soon he could only curl up, clutching his head, passively taking the beating and whimpering.\n\nThe \"melon-eating\" crowd suddenly felt this show wasn't very interesting. Boss Zhou even started calculating with Bai Yingying how many chairs they had broken and which areas they had dirtied, how much compensation would be needed afterward, and ideally, for it to be settled with hell money.\n\nMeanwhile, the female ghost, taking advantage of Liu Chuyu beating the lanky man, actually pulled the male singer's hand, walked over to Zhou Ze, and knelt before him:\n\n\"I earnestly beg the esteemed official to grant us fulfillment and send us both to the Underworld.\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged, showing no reaction. Vengeful spirits couldn't be sent down; they could only be destroyed on the spot. If one wasn't afraid of trouble, one could \"persuade\" her to disperse herself.\n\nAs for the male singer's lingering soul, Boss Zhou, who had just sent off a group of student lingering souls two days ago, wasn't truly that desperate now. Whether he consumed this mosquito-leg-sized piece of meat or not, he could wait until Liu Chuyu was finished before making a decision.\n\nThe female ghost was kowtowing to Zhou Ze,\n\npleading.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit helpless. Honestly, the Underworld wasn't run by him.\n\nVengeful spirits couldn't be sent into the Underworld by ghost attendants through the gates of hell; that was the rule.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't one of those fangirls who cried buckets while watching melodramatic romance dramas. No matter how tragically or fiercely she cried, he was still unable to help.\n\n\"Boss, there's a problem.\"\n\nBai Yingying, standing nearby, suddenly turned sideways and looked out the window. In the distant sky, a dark cloud was slowly descending towards them.\n\nAnd the lanky man, almost beaten into a pig's head by Liu Chuyu, suddenly raised his head at this moment, muttering something while bleeding from his mouth.\n\nLiu Chuyu, who had a natural aversion and hatred for men, suddenly stiffened.\n\nEarlier, when he was beating the opponent, the man kept muttering curses. Then he began to \"whimper and groan,\" seemingly humming some sort of local dialect. Liu Chuyu had thought the man had been broken by his beating.\n\nBut now, his mind had cooled down slightly from the excitement of thrashing someone, and only then did he realize that what the opponent had just been muttering was actually a spell from the Northeast, he was inviting a \"Great Immortal\" to possess him!\n\n\"Why didn't you just kill him directly at the beginning?\" Bai Yingying murmured.\n\n\"For ghost attendants, the cost of needlessly killing a living person is too high,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Whoosh whoosh whoosh...\"\n\nFrom outside the bookstore,\n\na gust of eerie wind swept in.\n\n\"It's really lively at home today.\"\n\nZhou Ze rested his chin in his hands, continuing to watch.\n\nBai Yingying turned and walked to the refrigerator, took out half a frozen watermelon, and returned, feeding it to Zhou Ze spoonful by spoonful.\n\n\"It's a bit cold.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nBai Yingying put the spoon into her own mouth first, held it for a moment, then took it out and brought it to Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth and ate it.\n\nWarm on the outside, cold on the inside,\n\nthe taste was just right.\n\nOn this side, a man and a woman seriously \"ate melon,\"\n\non the other side,\n\nthe situation had already begun to change drastically.\n\n\"Grandaunt Eight!\"\n\nThe tall, thin man let out a low cry, and then his entire demeanor underwent a completely different transformation, becoming sinister and aloof. Especially his originally triangular eyes, the pupils within them seemed to be splitting.\n\n\"Hiss hiss...\"\n\nFlicking its tongue,\n\nGrandaunt Eight let out a chuckle:\n\n\"Young man, this old one offers greetings. Whatever the misunderstanding, please grant this old one a little face and let's end this here.\n\nLet us take Chunmei back to the village. We guarantee she won't cause trouble again. Anyway, she has already transformed into a vengeful spirit, so she has no value to a ghost attendant anymore.\n\nAs for this fellow...\"\n\nGrandaunt Eight pointed at the male singer's lingering soul, who was still in a confused state,\n\n\"You can send him down. When this matter is concluded, after this old one returns, I will prepare some local specialties to send to both esteemed officials.\"\n\nZhou Ze ate another bite of watermelon, licked his upper lip, and shook his head slightly. \"Not exciting enough, not exciting enough.\"\n\nHe had originally thought that after the lanky man was thoroughly thrashed, he would definitely get his revenge by inviting a Great Immortal to possess him. Who knew this Great Immortal would actually come out and start reasoning?\n\nTsk-tsk,\n\nthis \"melon-eating\" truly tasted bland.\n\nIt was clearly his own bookstore, yet \"your family performs, then my family takes the stage\" kept alternating, and he, the owner, could only watch from the side.\n\nEh?\n\nRight,\n\nA Great Immortal?\n\nWait.\n\nZhou Ze showed a thoughtful expression, then as if he had thought of something, he told Bai Yingying to leave.\n\nBai Yingying nodded and walked away.\n\nLiu Chuyu hesitated for a moment, then nodded.\n\nWhen dealing with ordinary people or ordinary ghosts, he had a natural advantage, so he wasn't intimidated. But facing this \"Grandaunt Eight\" who had been mysteriously invited, Liu Chuyu didn't dare to be too presumptuous.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's view,\n\nLiu Chuyu was a newly promoted ghost attendant, likely filled with a craving for merit points. And this female ghost was probably a cultivator in life; sending her to the Underworld would earn him ten or even more merit points, so he had made an agreement with her for this purpose, making some compromises and concessions to send her down.\n\nBut who knew this female ghost wouldn't follow the script, ended up killing someone, and transformed herself into a vengeful spirit, instantly making her value become \"chicken ribs.\"\n\nHis recent thrashing of the lanky man was more like an outlet for his inner fury.\n\nAnd this mysterious Grandaunt Eight was probably also wary of the Underworld's background, unwilling to disrespect the Underworld's authority over such a matter, which was why she adopted a conciliatory posture.\n\nThe female ghost was still crying and pleading there, alternately pleading with Zhou Ze and Liu Chuyu, but no one paid her any mind.\n\nLiu Chuyu looked at Zhou Ze and sighed.\n\nZhou Ze, however, was smiling very happily. Seeing this, Liu Chuyu was startled.\n\n\"Come on, come back with me. Look at the mountains and waters of our old home one last time. We few old folks will then grant you release.\"\n\nGrandaunt Eight reached out and grabbed the female ghost, pulling her away from the male ghost.\n\n\"Silly girl, is such a man truly worth you entrusting so much to him, even severing your path to reincarnation?\"\n\nGrandaunt Eight wore an expression of deep regret,\n\nAnd then,\n\nshe led the female ghost by the hand towards the door, sighing as she went:\n\n\"I ask, in this world, what is love that it...\"\n\nIt seems Grandaunt Eight was also a female with a story... er... a feminine being.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nBai Yingying brought a delicate wooden box down from upstairs and handed it to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze impatiently opened the box,\n\nand took out an old-fashioned notebook, somewhat tattered, with a black cat printed on its cover.\n\nRaising the notebook,\n\nZhou Ze looked at Grandaunt Eight, who had just reached the bookstore's entrance,\n\nand hearing her sigh,\n\nimmediately shouted:\n\n\"I'll call you Grandaunt Eight,\n\ndo you dare to answer?\"\n\n---\n\nEveryone can search \"純潔滴小龍\" or \"kongbu66\" on WeChat and follow Dragon's official WeChat account. Dragon will write some side stories and character annals there. Bai Yingying and the Old Daoist's have already been written, and more will follow.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **666**: A common internet slang term in China, used to express admiration or approval for someone's impressive actions, similar to \"awesome\" or \"well done.\" Here, it's used somewhat ironically, implying the Old Daoist merely observes from the sidelines.\n2.  **Alpacas**: \"草泥马\" (cǎonímǎ) is a well-known internet meme in China. The pronunciation of \"cǎonímǎ\" is a homophone for a vulgar Chinese expletive, making this phrase a humorous and indirect way to express extreme frustration or exasperation.\n3.  **Eating melon**: \"吃瓜\" (chīguā) is a popular internet slang term in China, referring to observing a sensational event or drama as a bystander, similar to \"watching the show\" or \"rubbernecking.\"\n4.  **Great Immortal**: In Northeast Chinese folk beliefs, \"大仙兒\" (Dàxiānr) typically refers to animal spirits (such as foxes, weasels, snakes, or hedgehogs) believed to possess supernatural powers and the ability to temporarily possess human bodies.\n5.  **Chicken ribs**: \"鸡肋\" (jīlèi) is a Chinese idiom derived from a historical anecdote. It refers to something that has little value or use but is difficult to abandon, often because of the effort already invested. It implies something is mediocre or of little worth.\n6.  **I ask, in this world, what is love that it...**: This is the opening line of a famous classical Chinese poem by Yuan Haowen (元好問). The full line roughly translates to \"I ask, in this world, what is love that it makes life and death pledges?\" It is widely used to express deep reflection or lamentation about the powerful and often tragic nature of love.\n7.  **I'll call you Grandaunt Eight, do you dare to answer?**: This is a famous line from the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, spoken by Sun Wukong to challenge demons to reveal their true identities or powers. By accepting the address, the demon (or in this case, the \"Great Immortal\") would be forced to acknowledge its true nature or reveal itself.",

It was also his first time actively taking out the Yin-Yang Tome, intending to use it.\n\nThe Yin-Yang Tome has one function: it can collect souls!\n\nThe woman, who was allegedly raped by Zhou Ze's previous self, once said that if Zhou Ze wished, he could completely collect a few seductive ghosts inside and experience them when he had nothing to do;\n\nOf course, it would only be a half-set experience<sup>2</sup>.\n\nBoss Zhou certainly wouldn't be so bored as to use this Yin-Yang Tome to store seductive ghosts. To treat it as a high-end \"airplane cup\"<sup>3</sup> would truly be a great waste of heaven's gifts.\n\nToday,\n\nEncountering the so-called \"Great Immortals\" of Northeast China for the first time,\n\nBoss Zhou, on a whim,\n\nPicked up the Yin-Yang Tome,\n\nAnd prepared to get first blood<sup>4</sup>!\n\nPreviously, there were no grudges, no enmity,\n\nNow, no connection whatsoever,\n\nBut since you've come to my bookstore,\n\nIt means,\n\nWe're fated, aren't we!\n\nAunt Eight turned around and looked at Zhou Ze. She did not respond, nor did she shout, \"Your Old Eight is here!\"\n\nBut under the urging of the baleful energy Zhou Ze injected into it, the Yin-Yang Tome itself began to tremble. A cat's meow echoed leisurely, as if a long-slumbering fierce beast had revealed its ferocity.\n\nAunt Eight took a step back,\n\nBut a beam of white light shot forth from the Yin-Yang Tome, directly enveloping the tall, thin man's entire body.\n\nThe tall, thin man's face twisted into an extremely painful expression,\n\nAnd then wisps of black smoke rose from the crown of his head. The black smoke first swirled above, as if struggling and resisting.\n\nBelow,\n\nBoss Zhou, holding the Yin-Yang Tome, trembled violently without stop,\n\nDamn it,\n\nThis Yin-Yang Tome was actually like a high-power range hood, continuously absorbing the baleful energy from his body!\n\n\"Ugh, ugh, ugh...\"\n\nBoss Zhou desperately maintained his balance, while also continuously scraping together the baleful energy within his body.\n\nBut to the Old Daoist beside him, his boss suddenly looked like he was having an epileptic fit while clutching a notebook, doing a senior disco, just a bit of white foam at the corner of his mouth was missing.\n\nSeeing this, Bai Yingying immediately reached out and placed her hand on Zhou Ze's shoulder, transferring her own baleful energy to help Zhou Ze relieve the pressure.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was making a spectacle of himself,\n\nIt was simply because Boss Zhou was using such a \"high-tech product\" for the first time, and it didn't even come with an instruction manual.\n\nZhou Ze usually didn't dare to carry this gadget with him; he mostly had Bai Yingying safely keep it somewhere. Because walking around with it, it would constantly remind him which people around him were about to die.\n\nWould you save them or not?\n\nThey were clearly strangers, completely unrelated to you. If you knew they were going to die but did nothing, why add guilt to yourself for no reason?\n\nIsn't birth, old age, sickness, death, and all sorts of accidents just part of human nature?\n\nBut who can truly be detached? Even Boss Zhou, who had \"eaten his own conscience\"<sup>5</sup> in the past, if he suddenly saw a child or a pregnant woman not long for this world while walking on the street,\n\nCould he truly remain indifferent?\n\nThe previous lack of preparation,\n\nCoupled with the hurriedness of the moment,\n\nIndeed made Zhou Ze's side a bit flustered,\n\nBut fortunately, Aunt Eight didn't have much power, or perhaps this Yin-Yang Tome genuinely possessed a natural suppression against powerful soul-type beings. After all, it was a standard-issue magical artifact for underworld judges; even if its quality had declined, it was by no means easy to deal with.\n\n\"Damn it... however...\"\n\nAfter leaving behind a few vague cries,\n\nAunt Eight, condensed from that black mist, was finally collected by Zhou Ze into the Yin-Yang Tome.\n\nZhou Ze only felt that the tome seemed to have become heavier, and its cover had changed. Originally, there was only a black cat, but now it had a black cat on the left and a patterned snake on the right. The cat was noticeably much larger than the snake, roaring at it, while the snake appeared somewhat bewildered and trembling.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nHe slammed the notebook shut onto the bar,\n\nZhou Ze continuously took deep breaths.\n\nSo tired,\n\nToo tired,\n\nHis entire body was already drenched in cold sweat,\n\nLeft with no choice, Zhou Ze could only sit on the chair behind him, still panting heavily.\n\nThe tall, thin man lay unconscious on the ground. First, he had invited a spirit to possess him, then the spirit was forcibly stripped away, and on top of that, he was thoroughly beaten midway through. The tall, thin man was truly severely overdrawn, completely unconscious.\n\nAs for Liu Chuyu, his gaze, filled with deep apprehension, first swept over the tall, thin man, then focused intently on Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou didn't conceal his weakness in front of him,\n\nIt wasn't that Boss Zhou overlooked it,\n\nBut rather, he simply felt there was no need.\n\nJust a newly promoted underworld escort; even if he was panting, dealing with him would be no problem.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze even had a slight impulse in his heart, hoping that the other party couldn't help but make a move to snatch the Yin-Yang Tome, so he would have a good excuse to practice his newly advanced \"Dragon Claw Hand\" on him.\n\nThose claws, as long and sharp as a scythe, Boss Zhou really wanted to experience that feeling in actual combat.\n\nHowever,\n\nLiu Chuyu seemed to understand the bigger picture more than imagined, or perhaps, he was actually more cautious. With Aunt Eight's cautionary example before him, his view of Zhou Ze instantly changed.\n\nHe just leaned close to Zhou Ze and whispered:\n\n\"Buddy, your magical artifact is incredibly powerful! A Northeast Great Immortal, subdued by you in just one encounter?\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, reached out and took the tea Bai Yingying offered, and drank several mouthfuls in a row.\n\n\"But buddy, although Northeast Great Immortals have always been few in number, and it's been even harder for them to become spirits/demons since the founding of the PRC,\n\nThey are famously united. If you took one today, there's no guarantee that other Great Immortals won't come looking for trouble tomorrow or the day after.\"\n\nZhou Ze heard this and was not scared by the other party's couple of threats.\n\nBoss Zhou now truly had \"too many lice to fear being bitten\"<sup>6</sup>; he still had a big bomb on him that could detonate at any moment. As the saying goes, \"a son of a thousand gold pieces does not sit under crumbling eaves\"<sup>7</sup>, but Boss Zhou was like a desperado carrying a satchel of explosives.\n\nFor example, that old woman from the Bridge of No Return, Zhou Ze killed her directly.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know what kind of chain reaction arbitrarily taking in this Northeast Great Immortal would cause?\n\nDidn't matter,\n\nHe took him,\n\nIt was a good chance to test if his magical artifact was effective.\n\nIt wasn't that \"Salted Fish Zhou\"<sup>8</sup> suddenly understood and was preparing to turn over a new leaf and get serious,\n\nBack then, even Empress Dowager Cixi dared to collectively declare war on the world powers.\n\nUltimately,\n\nThis only shows that Zhou Ze's \"salted fish\" state had leveled up another notch,\n\nEntering the \"broken pot, broken smash\" realm<sup>9</sup>!\n\nLiu Chuyu pointed at the male singer again and said, \"Buddy, you've taken the big piece, so let me take the small piece?\"\n\nMeaning, he wanted Zhou Ze to at least send one ghost down, to gain a little merit, so he wouldn't have wasted his efforts.\n\nHe felt this request was not excessive. Zhou Ze basically didn't do much from the beginning to the end of this matter, but in the end, he subdued a Great Immortal. Without considering the potential chain reactions, just looking at the present, Zhou Ze had already \"eaten a mouth full of oil\"<sup>10</sup>.\n\nHe wanted to drink a mouthful of soup,\n\nIt wouldn't be excessive, right?\n\nWho knew Boss Zhou was very displeased with his \"understanding the bigger picture\" reaction? It seemed his scythe-brand fingernails would have to wait a while longer to be practiced. Facing the other party's \"reasonable request,\" he directly said:\n\n\"Scram.\"\n\n\"...\" Liu Chuyu.\n\nHoly crap,\n\nYou stinky man,\n\nAren't you too shameless!\n\nLiu Chuyu waved his palm,\n\nAnd the small mirror that was still in front of the Old Daoist immediately flew up. However, midway, Bai Yingying directly reached out and clutched the mirror.\n\nThe mirror trembled continuously in Bai Yingying's hand but could not break free from her \"demonic grasp.\"\n\n\"Hee hee hee, Boss, this one likes this little mirror! This way, this one can put on prettier makeup to attend to you in the future,\" Bai Yingying said, squatting in front of Zhou Ze and acting cute.\n\n\"Take it, take it.\"\n\nZhou Bāpí<sup>11</sup> had a naturally entitled look.\n\n\"Buddy, don't push it too far! We're all colleagues; making things too difficult for face-saving will make everyone look bad!\" Liu Chuyu pointed at Zhou Ze and chastised.\n\nZhou Ze heard this and smiled,\n\nCasually shifting into a \"Ge You Slouch\"<sup>12</sup> pose,\n\nMockery spilled from his expression.\n\n\"Are we really not going to talk sense?\"\n\nLiu Chuyu began the \"Don't say I didn't warn you\"<sup>13</sup> process.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze really wished he would just skip to the chase. When he killed those two underworld escorts in Yancheng back then, they weren't this long-winded.\n\nHowever,\n\nLiu Chuyu, who had previously thoroughly beaten the tall, thin man and chastised the female ghost,\n\nNow appeared incredibly cautious and cowardly<sup>14</sup>.\n\nSo cowardly that even the Old Daoist couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nDamn,\n\nThe boss is exploiting and bullying you like this,\n\nAnd you still don't dare to resist?\n\nNot only did you have knives on your face,\n\nBut you had a \"snip\" down there too, right?\n\n\"Just you wait!\"\n\nAfter saying these threatening words, Liu Chuyu actually turned around and prepared to leave.\n\nZhou Ze looked somewhat bewildered, pointed at himself, and asked Bai Yingying:\n\n\"When I first became an underworld escort, I wasn't such a coward, was I?\"\n\nBai Yingying shook her head,\n\nThen immediately nodded.\n\nWalking to the door, pushing open the bookstore door,\n\nLiu Chuyu, with his back to Zhou Ze and the others, was practically gnashing his teeth.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze called out to him again:\n\n\"Hey, stop.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu suddenly sighed in relief in his heart, turned around, looked at Zhou Ze, and smiled:\n\n\"Buddy, are you ready to 'turn weapons into jade and silk'<sup>15</sup>? That's right, 'when dealing with others, leave a thread'<sup>16</sup>, so later...\"\n\n\"I forgot I was going to be a Chief Constable, and I'm still short a few underworld escort subordinates.\n\nHow about this,\n\nLeave your soul blood to me,\n\nAnd then you can leave.\"\n\n\"...\" Liu Chuyu.\n\nA face that had been injected with hyaluronic acid countless times and gone under the knife countless times,\n\nAt this moment, was forcibly squeezed by anger into a pig-liver purple<sup>17</sup>!\n\n\"Pushing it... too far...\"\n***\n<sup>1</sup> 大仙兒 (Dàxiān'er): Refers to animal spirits (often fox, weasel, hedgehog, snake, or rat) believed to be capable of spiritual possession in Northeast Chinese folk religion.\n<sup>2</sup> 半套 (bàntào): Literally 'half-set,' referring to incomplete sexual services.\n<sup>3</sup> 飛機杯 (fēijībēi): Literally 'airplane cup,' a slang term for a male masturbatory aid.\n<sup>4</sup> 拿個一血 (ná ge yī xuè): Literally 'get first blood,' a gaming term for achieving the first kill in a match.\n<sup>5</sup> 吃了自個兒良心 (chī le zìgěr liángxīn): Literally 'ate one's own conscience,' an idiom meaning to be ruthless or heartless.\n<sup>6</sup> 虱子多了不怕咬 (shīzi duō le bù pà yǎo): Literally 'don't fear being bitten if you have too many lice,' meaning one is already in such a bad situation that a little more trouble doesn't matter.\n<sup>7</sup> 千金之子不坐垂堂 (qiānjīn zhī zǐ bù zuò chuítáng): Literally 'a son of a thousand gold pieces does not sit under crumbling eaves,' a proverb meaning one should not expose oneself to unnecessary danger.\n<sup>8</sup> 周鹹魚 (Zhōu Xiányú): Literally 'Salted Fish Zhou,' a nickname implying laziness or apathy, akin to a 'couch potato' or 'slacker.'\n<sup>9</sup> 破罐子破摔 (pòguànzipòshuāi): Literally 'broken pot, broken smash,' an idiom meaning to abandon oneself to despair, to let things go completely, or to be apathetic about a bad situation.\n<sup>10</sup> 吃了個滿嘴油 (chī le gè mǎn zuǐ yóu): Literally 'ate a mouth full of oil,' an idiom meaning to have greatly profited or benefited.\n<sup>11</sup> 周扒皮 (Zhou Bāpí): Literally 'Zhou the Skinflint,' a nickname referring to a ruthless exploiter, especially a landlord, from a famous Chinese story.\n<sup>12</sup> 葛優躺 (Gě Yōu Tǎng): Literally 'Ge You Slouch,' a popular internet meme posture of actor Ge You, symbolizing extreme laziness or apathy.\n<sup>13</sup> 勿謂言之不預 (wù wèi yán zhī bù yù): Literally 'do not say that it has not been foretold,' a formal warning often used before taking drastic action.\n<sup>14</sup> 從心 (cóngxīn): Literally 'follow one's heart,' but here used as a pun for 慫 (sǒng) meaning 'cowardly' in internet slang.\n<sup>15</sup> 化干戈為玉帛 (huà gāngē wéi yùbó): Literally 'turn weapons into jade and silk,' an idiom meaning to resolve hostilities peacefully.\n<sup>16</sup> 做人留一線 (zuòrén liú yīxiàn): Literally 'when dealing with others, leave a thread/line,' implying leaving room for maneuver or not being overly harsh, often followed by '日後好相見' (rìhòu hǎo xiāngjiàn) 'so you can meet again in the future'.\n<sup>17</sup> 豬肝色 (zhūgānsè): Literally 'pig-liver color,' referring to a dark, purplish-red hue, often used to describe a face flushed with extreme anger.",

    "content": "Being a good person is too tiring,\n\nBeing the kind of great person who can be featured in a promotional brochure is even more tiring.\n\nThat means you have to maintain absolute cleanliness and noble character from beginning to end, otherwise those utterly insufferable trolls will relentlessly dig up all your dark history.\n\nConversely,\n\nBeing a villain is much more comfortable.\n\nBoss Zhou felt very relaxed now. Exploiting new colleagues, peeling them layer by layer – it was simply delightful.\n\n\"You've gone too far!\"\n\nLiu Chuyu spread open his hand. A fleshy sprout grew from his palm, like a bean sprout unfurling. Immediately, a faint, fresh scent began to permeate the air.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously held his breath, continuing to stare at the person in front of him, or more accurately, at the plant growing from the other's palm.\n\nEvery Ghost Catcher has their signature skill, like his own fingernails and the little loli's vocal mimicry.\n\nThis guy in front of him had clearly planted something within his own body. This could explain why Liu Chuyu had been so tolerant earlier. Humans are easily influenced by subjective emotions, but plants can more calmly perceive things, seeking benefits and avoiding harm.\n\nPerhaps it was because of this plant inside him that Liu Chuyu had repeatedly tolerated things earlier.\n\n\"Bullying the weaker, huh? Then I'll have to see if you're even worthy!\"\n\nThe bean sprout in Liu Chuyu's palm quickly grew. At the same time, vines and weeds began to sprout from all the crevices on the outside and inside of the bookstore.\n\nLush and verdant,\n\nLuxuriant and thriving,\n\nA genuinely \"Green and Eco-friendly Bookstore.\"\n\nVines shot up from the ground, sweeping directly towards Zhou Ze's area.\n\nBai Yingying proactively stepped forward, grabbing several vines with both hands and tearing downwards, twisting them off. However, the broken vines quickly regenerated, continuously wrapping and binding Bai Yingying like sticky plasters*, making it genuinely difficult for Bai Yingying to break free for a moment.\n\nOld Daoist was already wrapped into a green zongzi* by the vines, and even Little Monkey was bundled into a small ball, rolling around on the ground.\n\nDeadpool, sitting in the corner, was also enveloped by the vines, but he merely tilted his head left and right in confusion. He seemed to be pondering whether these plants were part of the bookstore's landscaping or a sign of its disarray.\n\nDeadpool would likely remain in this state of indecision until he had fully thought through these questions, or until Zhou Ze proactively gave him an order.\n\nIn life, he had been a priest who was particularly adept at stirring up trouble, one might say, too clever by half in his machinations, always plotting and scheming. For him to end up in such a naturally dopey state was, it must be said, a rather amusing irony.\n\nThis wasn't an offensive spell; it was probably just for stalling and defense, or perhaps Liu Chuyu hadn't yet fully \"matured\" this plant, which was why the effect wasn't very obvious.\n\nBut at least for now, it did serve to hinder his opponent, which also showed that Liu Chuyu had no intention of clashing directly; he planned to take the opportunity to escape.\n\nEscape back to Changzhou.\n\nBy then, there would still be several Ghost Catchers in Changzhou, and if Zhou Ze still wanted to go to Changzhou to \"recruit\" subordinates, it would surely provoke the collective outrage of all Ghost Catchers in the Southern Jiangsu region.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring.\n\nLiu Chuyu still hadn't left.\n\nHe couldn't leave,\n\nBecause his vines had already entangled everyone else in the bookstore, but Zhou Ze was the only one missing.\n\nZhou Ze remained seated, leisurely, while the vines dared not approach him.\n\nFear,\n\nDread,\n\nTerror,\n\nThese emotions were clearly transmitted to Liu Chuyu's mind through the vines, their medium.\n\n\"Heh heh, I told you, we have a connection.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nIn the underground of that research institute, he had swallowed the fruit from the Old Tree Root's body. Who was the Old Tree Root? Practically a Great Demon.\n\nHow dared something like Liu Chuyu, who had just sprouted tender shoots, act so presumptuously around him?\n\nThis was just like how Bai Yingying was very fearful of the zombie aura emanating from him back then.\n\nWhile humans can often cry out, \"Are kings, nobles, generals, and prime ministers born to be so?\"* to incite rebellion, for demonic beings and other types of creatures, the hierarchical suppression based on bloodline is truly too immense and terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze tossed down his cigarette butt, stepped on it with his sole, then stood up and lightly clapped his hands.\n\n\"When I watched *Pokémon* as a kid, to capture a wild Pokémon, you first had to beat it up until it was on its last breath before you could catch it.\n\nIt's the same principle for taking on subordinates in TV shows: you have to beat them up first, then your subordinate will be obedient later.\"\n\n\"Yingyingying...\"\n\nEven Bai Yingying, who was greatly troubled by the entanglement of the green vines,\n\ncould surprisingly still spare a thought to cooperate with her boss at this moment,\n\nindicating that she, too, was subdued by the boss only after being thoroughly handled by him.\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head slightly, looking at Liu Chuyu,\n\n\"Let's have a fight. Actually, being my subordinate isn't bad. For example, Lin Ke, that old Ghost Catcher from Tongcheng.\n\nShe always says,\n\nthat serving me as her Catcher and being my subordinate,\n\nis the most correct decision she has ever made in her life.\n\nAnd another Ghost Catcher in Tongcheng is my sister-in-law. See, my subordinates and I really have a great relationship; everyone with me is very happy and harmonious.\"\n\nZhou Ze almost believed himself, thinking he truly was a good boss, a good leader.\n\nLiu Chuyu's expression flickered erratically. The next moment, he decisively retracted the stem sprout in his hand. He didn't even bother with the door, directly preparing to crash through the glass to leave.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze saw he was about to crash through the door,\n\nhe dared not delay.\n\nLast night, he had surreptitiously used \"Dragon Claw Hand\",\n\nalmost causing 'that one' within him to awaken. Although it was suppressed, it also shattered all the glass windows and various screens in the bookstore.\n\nHe himself woke up in the afternoon, and no one had any complaints.\n\nOld Daoist used public funds to first hire someone to replace all the glass, then bought a more expensive and better television to replace the old one. Bai Yingying, overcome with joy, also replaced her gaming monitor with an even more expensive one.\n\nAnyway, it was all on public expense, so everyone had no objections, treating it as an early upgrade to their quality of life.\n\nBut it was Boss Zhou's money bag that was being spent.\n\nBoss Zhou was heartbroken.\n\nThe glass had just been replaced this afternoon,\n\nand you want to crash through it again?\n\nWatched too many TV shows and movies, haven't you? Why avoid the door and insist on crashing through glass?\n\nZhou Ze waved his palm,\n\nfive long fingernails immediately grew out.\n\nA chilling wind instantly rippled outwards.\n\nA terrifying suction force directly clung to Liu Chuyu's body. Liu Chuyu had just jumped, and before he even touched the glass, his entire body was directly flung backward, crashing heavily onto the ground.\n\nZhou Ze quickly stepped forward. Liu Chuyu spread his arms, and vines sprouted from his body, attempting to block Zhou Ze.\n\nBut Zhou Ze's long fingernails were truly too sharp; they instantly tore the vines completely into shreds. Then he bent down, squatted, and two fingernails directly pinned either side of Liu Chuyu's neck.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze only needed to lightly squeeze,\n\nand Liu Chuyu would be \"served with the Dog-Head Guillotine\"*.\"\n\nZhou Ze stopped,\n\nlooking at Liu Chuyu.\n\nLiu Chuyu felt that today's experience was truly too bizarre to comprehend.\n\nHe had come to catch ghosts, to boost his performance,\n\nBut he didn't catch any ghosts, and instead provoked a Northeast Great Immortal*.\n\nThe Northeast Great Immortal, surprisingly, was quite reasonable and spoke very pleasantly.\n\nBut the final outcome was that after being exploited layer by layer, he still had to \"sell himself\" to him?\n\nThe new Ghost Catcher Liu Chuyu was, one could say, completely traumatized. In Changzhou, he knew several other Ghost Catchers; they weren't particularly close but were on nodding terms and generally polite to each other.\n\nYet, as soon as he came to Tongcheng,\n\nhe felt that the colleagues here were like bandits?\n\nA drop of soul blood floated out from Liu Chuyu's forehead, carrying a strong sense of resentment and unwillingness.\n\nHe was truly being \"forced into prostitution\"* by Zhou Ze.\n\nCollecting the other party's soul blood, Zhou Ze didn't delay, directly integrating it into his Ghost Catcher's badge. Contract successful, perfect.\n\nRetracting his fingernails,\n\nLiu Chuyu slowly climbed to his feet. He glanced at the performance points on Zhou Ze's Ghost Catcher's badge, and his already pale face turned ashen.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Your performance points... are even fewer than mine...\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nBeing looked down upon and surpassed by his own subordinate in terms of performance, as a leader, he inevitably felt a bit like losing face.\n\nActually, it was also due to Boss Zhou's \"salted fish\" work style* and his frequent comas, lasting half a month or a month at a time, which meant he didn't spend much time genuinely working on performance. Furthermore, Zhou Ze had a period as an intern Ghost Catcher previously, which also caused delays.\n\n\"As a leader, you don't need to know how to do the specific tasks; you just need to know what needs to be done, understand?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Liu Chuyu's face,\n\nSo smooth,\n\nSo tender,\n\nDamn it,\n\nHow much hyaluronic acid must he have injected!\n\nLiu Chuyu no longer wanted to argue. After getting up, he knelt on one knee again before Zhou Ze,\n\n\"Greetings, Catcher!\"\n\n\"Mm-hmm, get up, get up. The ground's cold; don't chill your body.\"\n\n\"............\" Liu Chuyu.\n\n\"Alright, there's nothing for you to do here. Go back to Changzhou. If anything comes up, I'll call you. Anyway, Changzhou isn't far from here.\"\n\n\"Uh... okay.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu stood up,\n\nthen said: \"My mirror...\"\n\n\"Dragon Boat Festival is coming soon, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Ah... yes.\"\n\n\"Giving your leader a little something as a token of respect during holidays and festivals isn't too much to ask, is it?\"\n\n\"Uh... not too much... but...\"\n\n\"Then why aren't you leaving?\"\n\n\"Oh, okay, I'm going.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu walked out of the bookstore in a daze, feeling as if he had dreamt it all.\n\n\"Boss, this mirror is fun!\"\n\nBai Yingying said, holding the mirror,\n\nHer reflection in the mirror was all smiles, like a blooming flower, wearing ancient headwear, delicate and charming.\n\nSaying this,\n\nBai Yingying also pointed the mirror at Zhou Ze, \"Boss, try looking into it; it seems to show past lives!\"\n\nWhen the mirror was pointed at Zhou Ze's face,\n\na \"crack\" sound was heard.\n\nThe mirror surface developed cracks, and then shattered directly.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nBai Yingying retracted her hand,\n\nlooking at the pile of shards on the ground, somewhat at a loss.\n\nZhou Ze, who had just unofficially accepted a gift from his subordinate, was also stunned.\n\nHe shook his head,\n\nand sighed:\n\n\"Sigh, what a spendthrift woman.\"\n\n---\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n*   **sticky plasters:** *Literally \"dog-skin plaster\" (狗皮膏药), an idiom describing something persistently annoying or difficult to get rid of.*\n*   **green zongzi:** *Zongzi (粽子) are traditional Chinese glutinous rice dumplings, often wrapped in bamboo leaves, giving them a green appearance.*\n*   **\"Are kings, nobles, generals, and prime ministers born to be so?\":** *A famous revolutionary slogan from ancient China, meaning \"Are kings, nobles, generals, and prime ministers born to be so?\" challenging inherited status and power.*\n*   **Dog-Head Guillotine:** *The Dog-Head Guillotine (狗头铡) is a legendary execution device from ancient Chinese folklore, famous for its association with the righteous Judge Bao, used to execute corrupt officials and powerful figures, signifying absolute judgment and demise.*\n*   **Northeast Great Immortal:** *Northeast Great Immortal (东北大仙儿) refers to a type of folk spiritual practitioner or medium from Northeast China, often associated with animal spirits or shamanism.*\n*   **\"forced into prostitution\":** *An idiom (逼良为娼) meaning \"to force an honest person into prostitution,\" used metaphorically to describe being forced into an unwilling or morally compromising situation.*\n*   **\"salted fish\" work style:** *Literally \"salted fish style\" (咸鱼作风), an idiom used to describe a lazy, unmotivated, or passive approach to work or life.*",

    "content": "This morning,\n\nBoss Zhou, as usual, sat in his customary spot.\nSunshine,\nNewspaper,\nCoffee,\nA Ge You Slouch*,\nA salted fish*,\nThus, Boss Zhou’s day began.\n\nEven though there had been many things yesterday, Zhou Ze, upon waking, tossed them all aside without a second thought, contentedly enjoying his vibrant morning.\n\nBai Yingying sat beside him, staring blankly at a pile of small fragments, her expression a little downcast.\n\nOld Taoist walked past, glanced at them, and said:\n\n\"This is the mirror that was shattered by Boss's handsomeness yesterday?\"\n\nAs he said this, Old Taoist deliberately raised his voice, afraid the Boss wouldn't hear him.\n\nBai Yingying looked up, pouted,\n\nHeld it in for a long time,\n\nBut still let out a \"poof\" of laughter.\n\nShe was actually still sad and upset about breaking the mirror yesterday. She knew her Boss had thin coffers and not many good things, and a rare one he'd just managed to acquire was broken by her before he'd even had a chance to enjoy it properly.\n\nOld Taoist also sighed, leaned in close, and whispered:\n\n\"Actually, this mirror was made to cry by Boss's ugliness. Look at these cracks, don't they look like tear stains?\"\n\n\"Clap…………\"\n\nZhou Ze folded the newspaper he was holding.\n\nOld Taoist was startled.\n\n\"The newspaper says Tongcheng is at a critical moment in its bid to become a civilized city.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Old Taoist was a little confused, but he had an ominous premonition.\n\n\"Old Taoist.\"\n\n\"Yes, here.\"\n\n\"Go do your part. Sweep the road in front of the shop.\"\n\n\"…………\" Old Taoist.\n\nOld Taoist, with a wilted head, went out carrying a broom and a mop. Zhou Ze also stood up and followed him out.\n\nLit a cigarette,\n\nStretched.\n\nJust then, across the street, a crowd had gathered. A woman inside was shouting loudly, her voice shrill and extremely aggressive.\n\nEarly in the morning, Nandajie already had heavy foot traffic, so naturally, a lot of melon-eating masses had gathered.\n\nAcross the street was likely an internet cafe, recently opened.\n\nBoss Zhou, cigarette between his fingers, slowly walked over. From his back, he looked exactly like a lazy loafer who spent all day doing nothing productive but wandering from one household to another, gossiping.\n\n\"My son didn't do well on his midterm! His teacher even contacted us parents, saying he's been unfocused in class lately, and I was wondering why. Well, good! Today I caught him!\n\nHe even told me he was going to school early for morning reading, but it turns out he ran off to the internet cafe to play games!\n\nDamn it,\n\nWho invented games?!\n\nWhy doesn't the country lock up all these damned game developers and internet cafe owners?!\n\nAren't they deliberately trying to ruin our children?!\n\nWhat do kids know?!\n\nIf there's a game, they'll play it!\n\nIf they think it's fun, they'll play it!\n\nThis thing is just like a drug addiction!\n\nKids have no idea!\"\n\nThe middle-aged woman continued to scream hoarsely with all her might.\n\nIn front of her stood a young man in a blue shirt. The young man was [...], very refined. While the woman spoke, he just stood opposite her, smiling, not refuting, not shouting.\n\nBeside the two, there was a disheveled-haired youth who looked like a high school student, head down, cheeks flushed, clearly feeling very ashamed by his mother's public shouting.\n\nThe woman spoke until she was tired,\n\nFinally pausing,\n\nA sort of halftime break.\n\nThe refined young man finally found an opportunity to interject, saying very calmly:\n\n\"Madam, if you wish to educate your son, you can take him home or back to school to slowly educate him with his teacher.\n\nThis is an internet cafe, a business establishment, and your shouting here is already affecting our normal operations.\"\n\n\"Bah! You still have the nerve to operate!\n\nNone of you internet cafe owners are any good, you're all just conning kids out of their money.\n\nEveryone, judge for yourselves! I just went inside and looked, it's all people playing games, every single one of them staring intently at the screen.\n\nAnd there were some with greasy faces, clearly having played all night, not going to work, not going to school, just single-mindedly playing games!\n\nIf their parents saw them like this,\n\nHow heartbroken would they be?!\"\n\n\"Madam, your son is already an adult. If he wants to use the internet, we can't stop him…………\"\n\n\"What adult or not-adult crap?! My son is still just a student, and he's taking the college entrance exam next year!\n\nI said, 'Why have my son's grades dropped?'\n\nIt turns out it's all because of this game,\n\nAll because of this internet cafe!\n\nThe government should shut down all game companies, they only corrupt children and make us parents worry!\"\n\nThe woman continued to shout incessantly.\n\nThe refined man reached out to adjust his glasses, shook his head, took out his phone, and prepared to make a call.\n\n\"What do you mean?! I'm reasoning with you!\n\nYou want to call people, don't you?\n\nYou want to play triad games with me, don't you?\n\nYou harmed my child, made my child addicted to games and his studies decline,\n\nAnd you still dare to call people to hit me?\n\nI'm telling you, I wasn't raised to be scared, I'm a local too. Let's see if you dare to have someone lay a finger on me!\"\n\n\"I'm calling the police.\"\n\n\"Calling the police?\" The woman froze for a moment.\n\n\"You're affecting my normal operations.\"\n\n\"Get lost! Have you no shame?!\" The woman raised her hand and struck directly. \"Smack!\" The refined man's phone was knocked down by the woman, falling to the ground. The phone rolled right in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Still calling the police? If my child can't get into a good university next year, it'll be because of scumbags like you opening internet cafes! I'm the one who should be calling the police!\n\nEveryone, judge for yourselves,\n\nIs it easy for us parents?\n\nProviding for our children's food, clothes, and schooling, who doesn't hope their child succeeds, who doesn't hope their child can get into a good university?\n\nBut then there are these bastards who make games, these black-hearted internet cafe owners,\n\nWho only think about making ill-gotten gains from children,\n\nThey're ruining our children!\n\nHeavens,\n\nSave the children!\n\nThese goddamned games!\"\n\nAt this moment, a young girl walked out from behind the man. She was likely an employee of this internet cafe. She first walked up to Zhou Ze, squatted down to pick up the phone, then directly pointed at the woman's nose and started her tirade:\n\n\"Save the children?\n\nYou still have the nerve to bring that up?\n\nYou can't educate your own child, you have no upbringing yourself, you can't teach your child properly, and you still have the nerve to blame games, and still have the audacity to blame internet cafe owners?\n\nYour kid is an idiot, his addiction to games means he's an idiot, he's a retard, which means you are the parents of a retard!\n\nDamn it,\n\nI want to shout too,\n\nSave the games!\n\nControl these idiotic kids!\n\nControl you bunch of idiotic parents!\n\nWhen we adults want to play a game, the blood can't even be red, it has to be green! Violent and bloody scenes have to be cut because they affect minors!\n\nMinors stealing money or robbing things, it's all blamed on games!\n\nSo, in this world, everyone's a good person, right?\n\nIt's all games' fault, right?\n\nDon't always think about shirking responsibility. In this society, 'one grain of rice nurtures a hundred kinds of people'**, some do well, and naturally, some have to be at the bottom. Why aren't others addicted to games? Why can others have good academic results?\n\nYou dog-thing who only knows how to give birth but not how to raise!\n\nOnly knowing how to push responsibility onto others!\n\nIf you don't know how to raise or teach, why didn't you wear a... condom when you were having fun?!\"\n\nThe woman froze on the spot.\n\nMany of the nearby melon-eating masses, after hearing the girl's sharp retort, actually started cheering her on.\n\nThis made the woman even more unbearable, and she directly rushed forward to physically fight the girl.\n\n\"You little hussy! Let me see you curse me, let me see you curse me!\"\n\nThe two women started fighting, but were quickly pulled apart by the surrounding melon-eating masses.\n\nMany people around started persuading the woman to let her son go to school first and stop making a scene. The woman, too, had been deflated by the girl's earlier scolding, and after leaving a few more harsh words, she dragged her son away.\n\nZhou Ze followed the woman for a while. When the woman dropped her son off at the bus stop, while she was still lecturing him, Zhou Ze walked up to her, reached out, and brushed a strand of her hair.\n\nThe woman turned her head and glanced at Zhou Ze, probably thinking he was dressed fairly well and didn't look like a molesting pervert. She dismissed it as unintentional and didn't pay it any further mind, turning back to continue scolding her son while waiting for the bus.\n\nZhou Ze sauntered back to the internet cafe.\n\nThe internet cafe entrance was empty again, and operations had returned to normal.\n\nZhou Ze walked up.\n\nThe environment of this internet cafe was indeed quite good, and the machines were new. So, even though it was early morning, there were quite a few customers inside.\n\nThe refined man was applying medicine to the girl's neck, likely from scratches she sustained during the scuffle.\n\nThe girl was still indignantly telling the refined boss something,\n\nBut the refined man just smiled casually and flicked the girl's nose with his finger.\n\nThe girl pouted, turned her head, saw Zhou Ze, and immediately asked:\n\n\"Good morning, sir, please show your ID card.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to use the internet.\" Zhou Ze placed his hand on the counter, looking at the girl.\n\nThe girl frowned slightly, clearly taking Zhou Ze for a hooligan.\n\nAt this moment, the refined boss walked over carrying a cup of tea. He paused when he saw Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"Sir, how can I help you?\"\n\n\"Actually, during the argument just now, I was quite on your side,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Haha, you've witnessed quite a scene, sir. It's all in the past now,\" the refined man said.\n\n\"I'm the bookstore owner across the street. Seven or eight years ago, sellers of novels like me were treated the same way as you internet cafe owners – we were all considered the prime culprits for corrupting their children.\n\nTimes are changing, society is changing, and many ancient cultures have been lost,\n\nBut the level of responsibility-shirking from one generation of parents to the next has been perfectly preserved.\"\n\n\"Since we're neighbors, please come inside. I'll treat you to some tea,\" the refined man said warmly.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, signaling no hurry.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze placed a small black insect, held between his fingernails, on the counter.\n\nThe small insect appeared to be at its last gasp, like a maggot, but it had colorful streaks on its body.\n\nPointing at the small insect,\n\nZhou Ze slowly asked:\n\n\"Sympathy is sympathy,\n\nUnderstanding is understanding.\n\nI don't like that woman either,\n\nBut letting her just die like this,\n\nIsn't that a bit too much?\"\n\n---\n*   **Ge You Slouch (葛優)**: Refers to a famous meme derived from Chinese actor Ge You, depicting a very relaxed, almost slumped posture, symbolizing a lack of ambition or a desire to \"lie flat.\"\n*   **Salted fish (鹹魚)**: A metaphor in Chinese culture for someone who is listless, unmotivated, and without ambition, like a dried salted fish that just lies there.\n**   **One grain of rice nurtures a hundred kinds of people (一樣米養百樣人)**: A Chinese idiom meaning that from the same environment or resources, a diverse range of people or outcomes will emerge, implying that individual differences are inherent and cannot be solely blamed on external factors.",

    "content": "The cultured boss glanced at his employee, shook his head, and made an inviting gesture to Zhou Ze, signaling that Zhou Ze could enter to talk.\n\nThe female employee beside them nervously clutched the corners of her clothes with both hands, so anxious that tears were about to fall. She was clearly terrified, not of Zhou Ze, but of her boss.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the inner compartment.\n\nFew internet cafes would specifically open an office; most would rather squeeze out every last bit of space to arrange one more computer station or one more private room. As for the staff's resting area, it was usually kept as simple as possible.\n\nHowever, this office was quite spacious. Inside it was another room, likely a bedroom. The main hall had a sofa and an office desk. The carpet was an ink wash painting sealed with film, in the grand landscape style. When one stepped on it, there was almost a delusion of being truly amidst white mountains and black waters.\n\nThe walls were adorned with calligraphy and paintings, some bearing the signatures of renowned artists that even Zhou Ze, who was unfamiliar with such things, recognized. He wasn't sure if they were real or fake.\n\nBut... they should be real, given that the other party could open an internet cafe in a place like South Street and luxuriously dedicate such a large space within it for living and resting.\n\nZhou Ze now looked at this person with a feeling akin to how others used to look at him.\n\nOpening a bookstore that surely lost money on the city's most prime commercial street...\n\nHmm,\n\nThis boss must be \"unfathomable,\" at least very wealthy.\n\nThe other party brewed tea and personally brought it over.\n\n\"Please, have a seat.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa. He had come, one could say, to demand an explanation, but in reality, his emotional inclination wasn't that strong.\n\nAnyone doing anything would inevitably carry some subjective emotional bias. For example, Zhou Ze wasn't very comfortable with that woman. Although he had stepped in to help her remove the worm, he wasn't frantic to demand an explanation or revenge for her.\n\n\"This matter is my fault. I failed to properly discipline my subordinate. I also thank you for your help, brother; otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nthe cultured man directly crushed the teacup in his hand.\n\nThen, gripping a ceramic shard in his right hand, he directly slashed downwards at his left arm!\n\nIn an instant,\n\nfrom his shoulder downwards on his left arm,\n\na gruesome wound appeared,\n\nbleeding profusely.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and took a sip of tea. Its aroma filled the air, refreshing the heart and mind.\n\nThe other party's blood dripped onto the carpet, forming a puddle, yet he acted as if nothing had happened. He adjusted his glasses with his right hand, his left hand hanging by his side, and walked up to Zhou Ze, asking:\n\n\"Brother, what do you think of this explanation?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating it was sufficient.\n\nIn fact, according to Boss Zhou's view of good and evil, he had no awareness of \"enforcing justice on behalf of Heaven\" just because \"special individuals\" were wreaking havoc. Zhou Ze wasn't sure if there truly existed \"Longhu Mountain Daoists\" or \"Laoshan Daoists\" in this world, but he understood one thing: no matter how things were arranged, the responsibility of punishing evil, promoting good, and maintaining order in the human realm could never fall upon him, a ghost officer.\n\nAt most,\n\nZhou Ze's true reason for coming was merely that he had inadvertently discovered his neighbor across the street was a bit unusual. Out of concern for what lies \"beside one's couch,\" he had come to probe the situation.\n\n\"Brother, may I ask your affiliation?\"\n\nFirst a self-punishment,\n\nthen an attempt to probe details –\n\nthis was a common tactic in the martial arts world.\n\nZhou Ze pointed his finger downwards,\n\nmeaning, \"I am an underground worker.\"\n\n\"Oh, a tomb-raiding brother. I wonder which school of tomb raiding you belong to?\"\n\n\".............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"It was presumptuous of me. My name is Qu Mingming. My hometown is in Henan, and my ancestors were doctors.\n\nBut by my generation, haha, I liked playing games. As a child, I often skipped class, disliked the medical hall, and preferred going to internet cafes. So, now that I've left home, I opened an internet cafe. This internet cafe has been open for about half a year.\n\nIt seems it was my oversight that I didn't know there was a 'crouching tiger, hidden dragon' like you nearby, brother.\"\n\n\"I thought you were from Miao territory.\"\n\n\"Is it because of that worm? In fact, since ancient times, medicine and Gu magic were not distinct. Even in more distant periods, doctors also moonlighted as fortune tellers and other professions, and were called shamans in tribes.\n\nPeople today, influenced by film and television literature, believe that only Miao territory has Gu magic. This is merely a common misconception.\n\nThat worm was fed and nurtured with traditional Chinese medicine ingredients. After entering the human body, it can release chronic toxins, causing the heart and lung functions to begin entering a failure cycle.\n\nI didn't expect my little sister to strike so hard this time. It was my oversight. Now that I think about it, I still feel a little fearful. Thankfully, brother, you intervened, otherwise, a great disaster would have occurred.\"\n\nIn this world, there indeed exist many unusual and reclusive individuals. They may not be versed in the profound, but their methods are absolutely not to be underestimated.\n\nSince the other party mistakenly thought he was a tomb raider, it meant he didn't possess the \"Yin-Yang Eye\" ability and couldn't see through his true identity.\n\nMoreover, the other party's attitude and self-punishment were perfect, well-measured in his conduct and very sincere, leaving no room for criticism.\n\nAs for that internet cafe attendant, the man's self-inflicted injury in front of him already counted as punishment on her behalf, and Zhou Ze would not pursue it further.\n\nAre you telling me I should really call the police and report, \"Officer, there's someone here using Miao Gu magic to commit murder?\"\n\nIf the person answering the phone were a witty police officer, they might even reply, \"Alright, then please, eliminate her on behalf of the moon!\"\n\n\"Since we are neighbors, brother, please stay and have a meal. I'm not particularly talented, but my cooking skills are passable.\"\n\nEat?\n\nForget it.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't accustomed to eating out.\n\nZhou Ze was about to refuse, but who would have thought that this Qu Mingming fellow would add another line:\n\n\"My medicated diet is very effective for conditioning hidden ailments.\n\nJudging by your complexion, I noticed you frequently get injured, brother?\n\nAs a result, accumulated stagnant qi in your body has solidified and not dispersed. These things are ultimately harmful to the body.\n\nConditioning it can have the effect of prolonging life.\n\nHumans live by qi; when qi is active, people prosper, and even ghost officers dare not trespass.\"\n\n\".............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"No need.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, preparing to leave. He knew his own body best. Was he going to come here for \"conditioning\" every time he went into \"ultimate mode\" from now on?\n\nAt that rate, this internet cafe boss might even think he was very dedicated, always fighting *zongzi* during tomb raiding.\n*Translator's Note: \"Zongzi\" (粽子) literally refers to a sticky rice dumpling, but in Chinese tomb-raiding fiction, it's slang for reanimated corpses or zombies found in tombs.*\n\nNo,\n\n*Zongzi*,\n\nthat sounds a bit jarring.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the door.\n\nQu Mingming, surprisingly, spoke again:\n\n\"My medicated diet has a great effect on conditioning hidden ailments.\"\n\nHidden ailments?\n\nZhou Ze stopped in his tracks,\n\nreached out and rubbed his neck, sighing:\n\n\"My neck does seem a bit sore. I did get injured before. Alright, then, I'll let you condition it.\"\n\n...............\n\nThe kitchen was on the second floor.\n\nYes,\n\nQu Mingming had rented two floors. One floor was for the internet cafe, office, and bedroom.\n\nThis second floor,\n\nhowever, was categorized and stacked with various medicinal ingredients, as well as several stoves and pots of different sizes. It was simply a foodie's paradise.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze came up and looked around, he went back downstairs. There was an area blocked by a curtain that Qu Mingming didn't pull aside for him to enter, and Zhou Ze, being sensible, didn't push.\n\nIn fact,\n\nZhou Ze had already \"heard\" dense, \"fine, rustling\" sounds inside. What was stored there was self-evident.\n\nBoss Zhou had little interest in those Gu worms.\n\nQu Mingming was responsible for making the medicated diet. He said he would bring it down once it was ready.\n\nZhou Ze was thus left alone in the office, admiring the paintings. The internet cafe attendant, with tears in her eyes, walked in and knelt on the floor, wiping the bloodstain from the carpet with a rag.\n\nShe was very sad and distressed. Seeing her, Zhou Ze felt as if he was looking at Bai Yingying.\n\nIf he were to get injured and bleed so much, Bai Yingying would probably be very sad too.\n\nWith this thought, Zhou Ze took out his phone and called Bai Yingying, telling her he was at the internet cafe across the street and wouldn't be coming back for dinner.\n\nBai Yingying excitedly shouted that once she finished with the bookstore's business, she wanted to \"double-team\"... no, she meant, duo-queue and team up with Zhou Ze.\n\nShe thought Zhou Ze had gone to the internet cafe to play games.\n\nPutting down the phone, Zhou Ze noticed the young girl standing still, looking at him with a complex expression.\n\nZhou Ze pointed at his face:\n\n\"Blaming me?\"\n\nThe young girl didn't react, just wiped her tears, pouted, and walked out of the office, looking very wronged.\n\nZhou Ze shrugged. These days, fangirls were the most difficult to deal with. He could only hope Qu Mingming would keep her in check. However, Zhou Ze didn't take it too seriously. It seemed that killings and injuries by non-ghost entities weren't under his jurisdiction anyway. There were far too many murders and other heinous incidents happening in the world every day.\n\n............\n\nThe young girl finished wiping the blood, washed her hands, and went up to the second floor.\n\nQu Mingming was squatting beside a small stove, watching the heat. The medicated diet simmering in the pot smelled rich but not greasy; instead, it emitted a refreshing, mint-like fragrance.\n\n\"Brother, you didn't have to do that.\"\n\nThe young girl walked up to her boss, somewhat distressed, and took hold of his left hand.\n\n\"It's nothing. My sister was thoughtless and caused trouble, so of course, I, as her elder brother, must bear the responsibility. The person downstairs is also reasonable and didn't make things too difficult for us.\"\n\n\"He's just a dirt rat from the lower nine streams of society; he actually thinks of himself as some official figure.\"\n\n\"Qu Zhenzhen, wrong is wrong. Without his intervention, you might have stained your hands with a human life. Gu worms have spirits; do you truly want to be devoured by the Gu worms you personally nurtured one day?\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, Zhenzhen was wrong, Zhenzhen was wrong.\"\n\nQu Zhenzhen reached out and caressed her brother's arm, burying her face and gently licking the wound with her tongue.\n\n\"Brother, you're so good to me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. You're my sister. If I'm not good to you, who will I be good to?\"\n\n\"Mmm, Brother loves me the most.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nQu Mingming reached out and stroked his sister's face.\n\nQu Zhenzhen looked up, gazing at her brother with admiration, and said:\n\n\"Brother, I will always be a good 'furnace/caldron' for you.\"\n*Translator's Note: \"爐頂\" (lú dǐng), literally \"furnace top\" or \"caldron top,\" is a specialized term often used in cultivation or alchemy contexts. Here, it implies Qu Zhenzhen is a living vessel or source for Qu Mingming's Gu worms, expressed with affection in a somewhat unsettling way.*\n\n\"Good girl.\" Qu Mingming lifted the lid to check, then said, \"It's time to add the medicine. His yang qi is deficient, and his yin qi is heavy, probably because he spends long periods in places like tombs.\n\nBut it's quite interesting.\n\nRegular tomb raiders wouldn't enter tombs so frequently. He gives me the feeling that he sleeps in tombs every day.\n\nAnyway,\n\nTake three qian of Nine Gourd Worms, one qian of Silver Thread Worms, and one qian of Dark Fire Worms. This should be able to remedy his yang deficiency.\"\n\nAfter Qu Mingming finished speaking, he placed his hand on his sister's jaw.\n\n\"Mmm, alright.\"\n\nThe girl nodded,\n\nthen opened her mouth.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nthree small worms with patterned wings flew out of her mouth.\n\nA small silver worm slowly wriggled out of her left ear.\n\nA dark, gold-granular worm forcibly squeezed out from the corner of her eye.\n\nThese worms obediently landed in Qu Mingming's palm.\n\nQu Mingming flipped his palm,\n\nand dropped all these worms into the pot.\n\nImmediately,\n\nthe medicated diet's aroma became even more fragrant.",

    "content": "回到吧檯後面，周澤自己給自己倒了一杯水，剛喝兩口，老道就回來了。\n\n\n\n  「貼了？」\n\n\n\n  「貼了，老闆。」\n\n\n\n  老道撓撓頭，又問道：「老闆，為啥他們車後面會有這麼多花圈？」\n\n\n\n  而且那不是真的花圈，不塗抹牛眼淚根本就看不見。\n\n\n\n  中國人都清楚，花圈是給死人用的，對活人來說是很不吉利的東西，車後面忽然多出這些玩意兒，肯定是不好的。\n\n\n\n  也因此，雖說那倆年輕城管差點讓自己在老闆這邊吃了掛落，但人家也是好心好意，老道還是把自己褲襠里藏著的符紙貢獻出去了，也心甘情願。\n\n\n\n  「被人在後面吐口水吐多了，也就有了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，沒當回事兒，想叫白鶯鶯給自己泡茶，才記起來鶯鶯還在網咖血戰。\n\n\n\n  「幫我泡壺茶。」\n\n\n\n  「哎，好嘞。」\n\n\n\n  老道手腳也是麻利得很，泡茶時也有模有樣的，他其實懂得很多，也善於學習，之前周澤就看見老道在許清朗不在的時候給客人調雞尾酒。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，什麼叫被人罵多了？」\n\n\n\n  「經常有人看見城管的車後，在車後面吐口痰，再罵一句『早死早超生』。 \n\n\n\n  慢慢地，花圈兒就多了起來了。」\n\n\n\n  「咒的？」\n\n\n\n  「算是吧。」\n\n\n\n  「但那倆小年輕城管人還不錯啊。」\n\n\n\n  「那位跳樓自殺的老師人也不錯。」\n\n\n\n  「額……這個……」\n\n\n\n  「放心吧，那花圈也弄不死人，至多讓人運勢弱一些，你那符紙貼上去後，應該就沒什麼問題了。」\n\n\n\n  「唉，貧道我是心裡替那倆孩子覺得委屈，憑什麼城管的惡名，需要他們來擔？」\n\n\n\n  「因為大部分人喜歡端起碗吃飯放下筷子罵娘；\n\n\n\n  如果自己開車或者走路時道路被小攤小販擋住了要罵；\n\n\n\n  網上看見城管『打』人的視頻，『欺負』小販的報導，也要罵。」\n\n\n\n  「唉，人言可畏，人言可畏啊。\n\n\n\n  老闆，茶泡好了。」\n\n\n\n  老道把茶水送上來，居然還一本正經地重新拿起抹布開始東擦擦西摸摸，哪怕書店裡頭被死侍給打掃得乾乾淨淨，但老道心裡發虛啊，生怕周澤再把之前「兒子」的事兒拿出來發作。\n\n\n\n  周老闆則是在沙發上躺了下來，剛躺下，許清朗就從樓上走了下來。\n\n\n\n  「中午在外面吃的？」 \n\n\n\n  許清朗這話裡頭帶著點興師問罪的意思。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  老道識趣兒地走遠了一些。\n\n\n\n  「老周，跟我出去一趟，幫我個忙。」許清朗對周澤道。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些無奈地睜開眼，看著換了一身幹練衣服的許清朗，猶豫了一下，還是點點頭。\n\n\n\n  作為朋友，既然人家開口了，你還真不好意思去當面拒絕，尤其你現在還躺在沙發上，一副什麼事兒都沒有的架勢。\n\n\n\n  想找藉口搪塞一下，都找不到。\n\n\n\n  而且不管怎麼說，老許一直以來也算是幫了周澤很多忙的。\n\n\n\n  許清朗開車，周澤坐在副駕駛位置上。\n\n\n\n  車是往許清朗老家門海縣去的，倒也不遠，通城這邊除非發生交通事故基本不會堵車，估計也就不到一個小時的車程。\n\n\n\n  「事情就是這樣，上次遷墳遇到的問題，現在開始發酵了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗剛剛把事情的經過和周澤說了一下。\n\n\n\n  這件事周澤是知道的，當初許清朗曾不止一次地離開書店回老家，就是忙遷墳的事情，雖說許清朗的玄術水平在周澤跟小蘿莉眼裡就是一個半桶水，但他的水平比農村的白事兒先生以及所謂的遊方道士，真的高出了太多太多。 \n\n\n\n  所以遷墳的事情也是許清朗親自主持的，他測算了方位和日期，一切都按部就班地弄，但問題還是發生了。\n\n\n\n  首先是祖墳那邊先出了水，按照許清朗的說法就像是地下溫泉噴滲透出來了一樣，那水還冒著白煙，熱乎著呢。\n\n\n\n  之後開挖時，又遇到了不知名的塌陷，沒弄出什麼人命動靜，但也把一桿負責遷墳的村民嚇得夠嗆。\n\n\n\n  到最後實在是沒辦法了，只能搶救性挖掘，弄出了一堆白骨之類的東西，有的棺材時間久了，自己也腐爛了，骨頭都埋在泥土裡頭了，有的以前窮，下葬時連棺材都沒有，直接一卷草蓆上路。\n\n\n\n  除了這些年上面有碑文的墳頭還好，其餘的大部分白骨到底是誰家的祖宗自家都沒辦法分清楚，反正一個村大部分都一個姓，也無所謂了，囫圇吞棗地全都遷移到另一個位置又集體下葬了。\n\n\n\n  至於老墳頭那裡還有沒有剩餘沒被遷走的屍骸，也沒人再去費心思找了，而且找的難度也實在是太大，總不可能直接喊挖掘機過來把這塊地給重新翻一遍吧？\n\n\n\n  但這之後，怪事就開始發生了，村里開始丟東西，而且一些人家養的家畜也開始莫名其妙地暴斃，還有人做夢夢到自家太爺爺太奶奶這類的來哭訴，總之，說這個村子被弄得雞犬不寧有些誇張了，但至少也是草木皆兵。\n\n\n\n  許清朗想過辦法去解決，但都無濟於事，只能請來周澤幫忙。 \n\n\n\n  到許清朗村子裡時，已經是下午三點多了，雖說是村子，但家家戶戶基本都是二層小洋樓，外面不遠處就是大公路，村子裡頭也都是水泥路，不少人家場子上還停著好車。\n\n\n\n  江浙滬這邊的農村跟西南地區的農村差別還是很大的，一是因為當地經濟發展原因，二則是因為地理環境原因，發展起來確實比西南地區多山環境要方便適宜得多。\n\n\n\n  許清朗把車停在田埂旁的水泥路上，他很乾脆，也不說回老家了帶周澤去見個長輩親戚什麼的，直接帶著周澤就上墳頭去了。\n\n\n\n  老祖墳區域已經長滿了雜草，顯得很是寂寥。\n\n\n\n  「遷墳是因為征地，這裡會有高鐵線從這裡走，之前村子裡不是很願意，在獲得一筆賠償款之後，大家才同意了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗蹲在田埂邊，點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  周澤圍繞著墳圈走了一遍，然後聳聳肩，道：\n\n\n\n  「沒發現什麼問題，也沒感知到鬼氣之類的，這裡乾淨得像是每晚敷完面膜的你。」\n\n\n\n  「我也試著找過，但也沒在這裡發現什麼，我原本以為是我道行不夠，既然你都發現不了什麼，那問題可能不是出現在這裡。」\n\n\n\n  「之前挖出來的屍骸最後怎麼處置的？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「除了能分清楚的被單獨安葬，其餘的基本都被合葬了。」許清朗說道。 \n\n\n\n  「那可能七婆跟八婆生前就是仇人，死後被不小心合葬在一起吵架了？」\n\n\n\n  周澤半開玩笑地說道。\n\n\n\n  「事情沒那麼簡單，鬼魂會吃家畜？」\n\n\n\n  就在二人一起抽著煙聊分析這件事的時候，遠處忽然傳來了大喊聲：\n\n\n\n  「跳水啦！跳水啦！跳水啦！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  呼喊的是一個老婆婆，一把年紀了，但嗓門兒依舊洪亮，這一聲聲叫喊，足以將半個村子給驚動。\n\n\n\n  許清朗和周澤馬上跑過去，已經有幾個男子下池塘了，也沒等許清朗和周澤有什麼反應，那幾個人就把一個婦人從水塘里拉了上來。\n\n\n\n  江南農村有喜歡自家修水塘的習慣，可以自己養養魚做點水產什麼的。\n\n\n\n  婦人被拉上來時，臉色泛白，倒是還醒著，手在無意識地抓著什麼，像是還停留在剛溺水時的絕望階段。\n\n\n\n  許清朗馬上過去檢查她的狀況，周圍村民也紛紛跟許清朗打招呼。\n\n\n\n  周澤站在邊上看著，他忽然想到了一個問題，老許不是因為拆遷得了二十幾套房麼，這裡又是他的老家，為什麼這裡沒拆遷？\n\n\n\n  又或者，這裡是他的老家沒錯，但他當初和爹媽一起住時，並不是生活在這個村里？\n\n \n\n  周澤也沒好意思問許清朗這個，人家正在著急著呢，這個時候他也沒興致拿自己二十幾套房出來裝逼。\n\n\n\n  跳水自殺，在哪裡都不算罕見，周澤在水塘邊蹲了下來，水塘的水不是很清澈，上面漂浮著不少綠藻。\n\n\n\n  伸手，撥開面前的綠藻，周澤微微側頭，看向水面下面，還是什麼都沒發現，也什麼都沒看見，池塘雖然髒，但絕不是有「髒東西」的髒。\n\n\n\n  婦人被背回屋裡去了，附近聚攏了不少村民，通城屬於東部沿海地區，所以哪怕是農村裡的青壯年，上班的話也能就近找到工作崗位，沒必要背井離鄉出去打工，農村裡的人氣兒還是很足的。\n\n\n\n  許清朗還在裡頭忙活著，周澤站在人群外面，抽著自己的煙。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，前面走來一個衣著有些邋遢的老頭，一邊走一邊罵，周圍村民臉上都露出了噁心排斥的表情，紛紛讓開。\n\n\n\n  老頭自顧自地罵著自己的東西，\n\n\n\n  先罵振幅，\n\n\n\n  再罵村長，\n\n\n\n  又罵了這些見錢眼開的村民，\n\n\n\n  一副恨其不爭的感覺，\n\n\n\n  一邊走一邊罵，唾沫星子橫飛，罵得有多難聽就有多難聽，\n\n\n\n  數典忘祖，見錢眼開，對不起先人………… \n\n\n\n  周澤在旁邊當熱鬧看著，靠在一棵槐樹上。\n\n\n\n  老頭在周澤眼裡倒是挺可愛的，人活到這個歲數了，也沒啥看不開看得開的了，想罵就罵，想鬧就鬧，想瘋就瘋，反正老子沒幾年好活快蹬腿的人了，幹嘛還受你這人間鳥氣。\n\n\n\n  只是，\n\n\n\n  老頭罵著罵著居然拐向了周澤這邊，當他看見周澤時，下意識地瞪大了眼睛。\n\n\n\n  「爺爺，爺爺…………」\n\n\n\n  一個小女童從遠處跑來，拉住了自家爺爺的手，她生怕爺爺亂跑亂鬧。\n\n\n\n  但老頭還是繼續盯著周澤在看。\n\n\n\n  「這是外面來的叔叔，不是村裡的。」\n\n\n\n  女童對自家爺爺說道，爺爺年紀大了，腦子不大能記事兒了。\n\n\n\n  「什么叔叔！」\n\n\n\n  老頭對著周澤直接一口唾沫吐出來，\n\n\n\n  吐在了周澤的鞋面上，\n\n\n\n  「死鬼！」\n\n\n\n  「對不起，對不起，叔叔，對不起對不起。」\n\n\n\n  女童馬上蹲下身用自己的衣袖給周澤擦鞋面，她生怕這個外來的叔叔打自家爺爺。\n\n\n\n  「回來，給什么小鬼擦鞋面！\n\n\n\n  咱老崔家，丟不起這個人！ \n\n\n\n  人是人，鬼是鬼，活著的時候堂堂正正，\n\n\n\n  死後也就不用給這幫小鬼卑躬屈膝！」\n\n\n\n  老頭呵斥自家孫女，同時把孫女給拉了回來。\n\n\n\n  孫女站在老頭身邊不停地對周澤道歉，喊「對不起對不起」。\n\n\n\n  周澤低下頭，看了看自己剛剛被小女孩擦拭過的鞋面，他是有潔癖的人，老頭的一口濃痰雖然被擦去了，但心裡的膩歪卻難以消除。\n\n\n\n  再見這老頭雖然神神叨叨的，被村民所不喜，但居然是一個藏龍臥虎的傢伙，看似瘋瘋癲癲，但實際上比這個村子裡其他人都看得要更清楚。\n\n\n\n  「你不怕閻王，那你的孫女呢，要不，我帶她先下去？」\n\n\n\n  周澤半開玩笑似地說道。\n\n\n\n  「豎子，爾敢！」\n\n\n\n  老頭大吼一聲，\n\n\n\n  直接撞向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  「噗通！」\n\n\n\n  周澤原本就站在池塘邊，\n\n\n\n  這下子被老頭一撞，\n\n\n\n  居然跟老頭一起摔入了池塘水中。\n\n\n\n  「又有人跳水了，又有人跳水啦！！！」\n\n\n\n  「救人，救人，快救人啊！」 \n\n\n\n  「爺爺，爺爺！」\n\n\n\n  「崔瘋子跳水了！！」\n\n\n\n  岸上傳來村民們的呼喊聲……",

    "content": "Boss Zhou had fallen into water more than once before, especially in bodies of water like ponds; it had happened in hell, and in dreams, but this was the first time he'd fallen into water in reality, and to top it off, he'd been sent in by a deranged old man with a headbutt.\n\nIf he'd known earlier, he wouldn't have been so foul-mouthed. Why stoop to a madman's level when he was perfectly fine? He had needlessly suffered this \"savage impact\" from him, and what shocked Zhou Ze even more was that after falling into the water, the old man had tightly gripped his shoulders and tripped his calves with his legs, clearly intending to drag him down and drown together at the bottom.\n\nThere were indeed villagers above starting to prepare to jump in and save them, but Zhou Ze dared not entrust the choice of his fate to these villagers. Instead, he directly extended his nails and stabbed them into the old man's back.\n\nThe old man, who had just been clinging on fiercely, instantly shivered and went limp.\n\nZhou Ze carried the old man to the surface. Boss Zhou's swimming skills were actually just average, but this wasn't a big river, just a small pond, so carrying a lightweight old man up wasn't much of a problem.\n\nAfter getting ashore, Xu Qinglang rushed directly to Zhou Ze and shouted:\n\n\"What happened to you? What's going on?\"\n\n\"It was Madman Cui who went crazy and knocked this young man into the pond! That Madman Cui, always deranged and muttering curses, now he's trying to kill people!\"\n\n\"Call the police! He has no children, no family, so it doesn't matter for him, but what if next time he pushes someone else's family member in?\"\n\n\"Right, call the police. It's best to have the mental hospital take him. He's getting more and more out of line.\"\n\nThe little girl knelt by her grandfather's side, constantly wiping away tears as she looked at her unconscious grandfather, calling for him to wake up quickly.\n\n\"Take him back. He has clues on him.\" Zhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, not doubting him, and walked straight over to hoist the old man onto his shoulders.\n\n\"I'll take him back first. There's no rush to call the police. Let's handle the current situation first, everyone, don't panic.\"\n\nWith that, Xu Qinglang carried Old Man Cui and walked out of the crowd.\n\nZhou Ze and the little girl followed behind.\n\nThe little girl continued to cry the whole way. Zhou Ze, however, felt a bit guilty. He was the one who had joked, and it was that kind of joke, so getting knocked into the water by her grandfather served him right.\n\n\"Where's your home?\" Zhou Ze asked the little girl.\n\n\"His house is in the mud house at the intersection ahead. This old man has no children, no family, and he likes to drink too much, so he's a bit addled in the head. That's why his life isn't very good.\" Xu Qinglang was quite familiar with the situation in this part of the village.\n\nSoon, everyone arrived at the location of the mud house.\n\nAmong the surrounding two-story, or even three- and four-story Western-style houses, a very old mud house from the last century stood there, indeed looking quite out of place.\n\nThe door wasn't closed, perhaps there was nothing in the house worth a thief's attention.\n\nThe mud house had three rooms. The central one was the living room, half of which was filled with scrap metal like cans and liquor bottles that the old man had recently collected, while the other half was dedicated to enshrined statues, with the offering table cleaned spotless. To the left was the bedroom, with an old-fashioned wooden bed. To the right was the kitchen, still using an earthen stove.\n\nXu Qinglang first settled Old Man Cui on the bed, then looked at Zhou Ze and asked, \"Should we wake him up now?\"\n\nIn his words, there was a sense of distrust.\n\nIt wasn't distrust of Zhou Ze; Xu Qinglang simply didn't believe that this old man, who had been deranged since Xu Qinglang was very young, could have any clues. This wasn't like those novels found on bookstore shelves, where picking up a ring in the wilderness could reveal an old grandpa living inside, or where the most formidable person at Shaolin Temple was the sweeping monk in the Sutra Depository.\n\n\"He has Yin-Yang Eyes.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nTo be able to see that he was a ghost at a glance, there was no other explanation besides Yin-Yang Eyes. Furthermore, Zhou Ze hadn't sensed any other aura fluctuations on the old man. If the old man were a practitioner of metaphysics, there would have been no need for him to resort to a headbutt to drag him into the pond in a suicide attempt.\n\n\"Yin-Yang Eyes?\" Xu Qinglang looked with some surprise at the old man lying unconscious on the bed.\n\n\"I really didn't expect that.\"\n\n\"He could see my identity at a glance.\" Zhou Ze walked to the threshold and sat down.\n\n\"I'm going out to buy some things for dinner.\" Xu Qinglang said, walking out of the house.\n\nZhou Ze waved to the timid little girl beside him, motioning for her to come closer.\n\nThe little girl was a bit shy. It took several calls for her to come over, and she apologized at the same time:\n\n\"Uncle, my grandpa didn't mean it, he really didn't mean it.\"\n\n\"Mmm, mmm, I know. It was Uncle's fault, the joke went too far. By the way, do you know what's been happening in the village recently?\"\n\nThe little girl nodded.\n\n\"Then did your grandpa say what the reason was?\"\n\n\"Grandpa said, Grandpa said...\" The little girl seemed hesitant to speak, clutching her fingers, as if deliberating whether to say it or not.\n\n\"Don't worry, tell Uncle. Uncle won't tell anyone else.\"\n\n\"Grandpa said it's because the villagers were greedy for the compensation money. For that bit of money, they even gave up their ancestral graves. If the ancestors know in the afterlife, they'd be furious enough to stomp their feet. Grandpa also said, our village's ancestral graves were originally in an excellent location. This time, the demolition shouldn't have extended to us. It was the village chief colluding with someone from above, forcefully moving the boundary line this way. A few years ago, West Village was demolished. The people from West Village received a lot of houses and money as compensation, and they all moved into the city. The villagers were incredibly envious and all wanted to be demolished too.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nThe ancestors might indeed have grievances, but those causing the destruction shouldn't be the \"returning souls.\"\n\n\"What else did your grandpa say?\"\n\n\"He told me not to run around at night, saying it hasn't been peaceful lately and there are unclean things scurrying around the village. I asked Grandpa what they were, if they were foxes or wild dogs, but Grandpa wouldn't tell me.\"\n\nUnclean things, scurrying around? Only coming out at night?\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, slowly pondering.\n\nThe West Village incident the girl mentioned should be the village Old Xu was from before. East Village and West Village likely shared a surname, and their ancestral graves were probably lumped together. Given Old Xu's current wealth, he probably wouldn't stoop to covet this small compensation amount. The reason he took on this matter was likely because his own ancestors were also buried there.\n\nIf it wasn't ghosts causing trouble, could it be transformed spirits causing mischief? If they were spirits/demons, then everything would make sense, but dealing with spirits/demons is actually a bit more troublesome than ghosts.\n\nJust then, a cough echoed from inside the house; the old man had woken up.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the bedroom doorway, looking at the old man who was now sitting up.\n\nThe old man glanced at the little girl standing beside Zhou Ze again, and immediately cursed: \"You damned brat! If you dare lay a hand on my granddaughter, I'll... I'll... I'll...\" After thinking for a long time, Old Man Cui couldn't come up with any further way to threaten him.\n\n\"I'm here on someone's behalf to solve a problem. I don't have time to mess around with you. If you keep being difficult, I'll pull some strings and send this girl to a welfare institution. Anyway, looking at your appearance and circumstances, you don't seem like you can raise a child well.\"\n\n\"You... you dare...\" The old man's arrogance immediately deflated a bit.\n\nThe little girl, being very bright and clever, pulled over a small wooden stool for Zhou Ze to sit on. Zhou Ze thanked her, exhaled a smoke ring, and pointed at the old man, saying:\n\n\"Speak. What exactly is going on? You have Yin-Yang Eyes, don't you? You should be able to see what those villagers can't.\"\n\nOld Man Cui mumbled a few times, then cautiously asked, \"Are you really here to help?\"\n\n\"What good would it do me to lie to you?\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll tell you. This is a sin! A sin committed by their descendants! These people who forget their ancestors, these...\"\n\n\"Get straight to the point. Are the ones causing trouble in the village the spirits of ancestors?\"\n\n\"No... no.\" Old Man Cui shook his head.\n\n\"Then why are you cursing them?\"\n\n\"I just couldn't stand it. Such good ancestral graves, such excellent feng shui! My parents, my grandparents, they were all buried there, and as a result, with one dig from them, everyone's remains rolled together. You in me, I in you, no one can even tell whose bones are whose! What do you call that if not a sin?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, \"Keep going. What exactly is it?\"\n\n\"Do you see my doorstep?\"\n\n\"I see it. It's very high.\"\n\n\"Be more specific.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked to the threshold of the living room. This threshold was quite old, just like the ancient mud house, but on its outer side, there were two fresh friction marks that had just appeared.\n\n\"That night, he came. He crashed through my door, trying to get in. But the threshold was too high, he couldn't jump over it.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up at Old Man Cui, who was still sitting on the bed, and said in a low voice:\n\n\"A jiangshi?\"¹\n\n\"Cough, cough, cough...\" Old Man Cui coughed. \"What else could it be besides a jiangshi?\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you say anything?\"\n\n\"That day, he was wearing clothes...\" Old Man Cui said with a grimace, \"He was wearing local clothes. How was I supposed to know which person he had disguised himself as? It was dark, I couldn't clearly see his face, and I didn't dare run outside to look.\"\n\n\"I'm back.\"\n\nXu Qinglang returned, carrying some cooked dishes and a few boxed meals.\n\n\"You're awake.\" Xu Qinglang glanced at Old Man Cui.\n\n\"Hehe.\" Old Man Cui chuckled, saying nothing more. He knew Xu Qinglang; after all, Xu Qinglang had grown up in this area. Without needing anyone's help, Old Man Cui slowly walked to the living room by himself.\n\nXu Qinglang placed the dishes on the small table and brought over a few stools. The boxed meals were set out, and the cooked dishes were spread open on plastic bags.\n\nZhou Ze sat down nearby, looked at the small dining table, and asked somewhat strangely:\n\n\"Why did you only buy three boxed meals?\"\n\n\"What do you mean 'only three'? There are just three of us, so I bought three. Did you suddenly get a bigger appetite today? Then I'll share some of my food with you.\"\n\n---\n¹ **Jiangshi**: A reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, often translated as \"hopping zombie\" or \"Chinese vampire.\" They typically move by hopping and are repelled by certain objects or rituals.",

    "content": "\"Three people?\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly looked at the timid little girl standing behind him.\n\nStartled by Zhou Ze's gaze, the little girl subconsciously took a few steps back, looking to her grandpa for help.\n\nThe villagers and Xu Qinglang had both said that Old Man Cui had no children, and was a lunatic. So how could he possibly have a granddaughter?\n\nAlso, the little girl had only ever spoken and interacted with him; whether by the pond earlier or inside the house, she hadn't communicated with anyone else at all.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't noticed this point before, but after specifically recalling it now, he truly began to grasp the implications.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang asked, shoveling a mouthful of rice into his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Old Man Cui; he needed an explanation.\n\nOld Man Cui lowered his head, picked up his chopsticks, and began eating, seemingly with no intention of acknowledging Zhou Ze at all, while also complaining to Xu Qinglang for not bringing back some wine.\n\n\"Give me an explanation,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Hm?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze, somewhat confused.\n\n\"This pig head meat is definitely short on weight. That guy Pig Head Four must not recognize you, otherwise, he wouldn't have ripped you off.\" Old Man Cui sighed, \"In this world, it seems that being an honest person won't make you rich anymore.\"\n\nOld Man Cui was still completely ignoring Zhou Ze.\n\nXu Qinglang slowly put down his chopsticks. He could sense the atmosphere was off. More importantly, he understood his friend; though he usually liked to lie alone on the sofa sunbathing, deep down, he was a person with a strong desire for control.\n\nThis might be related to his past life as a hospital director, where he liked to have everything under control. In the bookstore, he himself was quite content, but what about the others?\n\nThe Old Daoist?\nYingying?\nThe Death Retainer?\nIn ancient times, they'd be stewards, maids, and guards.\n\nXu Qinglang felt good about himself, not classifying himself as a \"cook.\"\n\nOld Man Cui smacked his lips while eating, his mouth dripping with oil.\n\nThen, a hand appeared behind his head.\n\n\"Whack!\"\n\n\"Mmmph mmmph mmmph mmmph mmmph mmmph...\"\n\nOld Man Cui's entire face was pressed into the pile of cooked dishes; no matter how the old man struggled and resisted, it was useless.\n\n\"Thinking you have Yin-Yang Eyes,\nthinking you're old,\nmeans you can disregard everyone?\"\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nZhou Ze kicked off one of the small table's legs. Old Man Cui sprawled directly onto the floor, still yelling something, but all that came out was a muffled gurgle of \"mouth chewing mud.\"¹\n\nThe little girl cried out and rushed over, trying to push Zhou Ze away and rescue her grandpa. But Zhou Ze's left hand immediately grew long nails, and wisps of black mist coiled around the little girl, trapping her in place, unable to move.\n\nBut it seemed also due to the black mist that Xu Qinglang finally saw the little girl's form.\n\n\"Th-th-there's a child here!\"\n\nZhou Ze stepped back. Old Man Cui immediately scrambled up from the floor, wiped the grease and food from his face, and charged at Zhou Ze with a furious howl, ready to fight him to the death.\n\nThis time, Boss Zhou was prepared.\n\nAn arm swung directly, an elbow striking Old Man Cui heavily in the chest. Old Man Cui was old after all; even if Boss Zhou was a \"salted fish,\"² at least he was in his prime. Old Man Cui was knocked to the ground once more.\n\nThe little girl, trapped in place, cried incessantly with anxiety.\n\n\"If you won't tell me, I'll peel her open myself and see.\nWhat exactly is she, that even I couldn't tell she wasn't human!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward, his fingernails slowly elongating.\n\nThe girl's presence had caused Zhou Ze no discomfort, and that was the greatest anomaly, as Xu Qinglang and the villagers couldn't see her.\n\nShe was illusory, yet so real!\n\nHis nails slowly approached the girl's skin.\n\nIf you are willing to peel open my heart layer by layer by layer, you will find, you will be surprised...³\n\nZhou Ze was now truly planning to peel the girl open to see what her composition actually was.\n\n\"Don't touch her! I'll tell you, I'll tell you! She's a corpse fetus I found and brought back from the ancestral graves.\"\n\nOld Man Cui seemed to have given up all resistance, ready to be frank.\n\nThis old man possessed a stubbornness common among people of his age. It was evident from the villagers' attitude toward him that he had a significant flaw in how he dealt with others.\n\nHe was just stupid, truly stupid, to put on his airs in front of a Ghost Messenger.\n\n\"Corpse fetus, what is that?\" Xu Qinglang asked, directing the question to Zhou Ze instead of Old Man Cui.\n\n\"Why are you looking at me?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"You don't know?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\"\n\nOld Man Cui sighed. \"A corpse fetus,\" he explained, \"is a form created by corpse energy. It's not a corpse getting pregnant and giving birth to a child. It's when a body is buried, it's already pregnant. But when she died, the fetus inside also died with her, becoming a stillborn fetus. However, if the Feng Shui is right, or if other serendipitous factors contribute, the stillborn infant in the womb can, even with the physical body dead, emerge from it as a soul and be re-nurtured. Xiao Chai is one such being. Three years ago, I was passing by the graveyard and saw her kneeling there, crying. Her face was unfamiliar, so I asked her which village she was from. She said her mother was underground, and she had playfully run out from there and now didn't know how to get back. So I brought her back and raised her.\"\n\nAfter listening to Old Man Cui's account, Xu Qinglang immediately asked, \"You're raising her?\"\n\n\"She only needs a little blood every day, chicken blood or duck blood is fine, even human blood will do. Just a small bowl is enough. She's so easy to raise, well-behaved, thoughtful, and she knows how to take care of me. She's like my own grandchild—no, closer than a real granddaughter!\" Old Man Cui said, looking at the little girl.\n\n\"I didn't ask before, but is that why that zombie comes knocking on your door at night? Is it because of her?\" Zhou Ze pointed at the little girl.\n\n\"She's mine! She's mine!\" Old Man Cui immediately pulled the little girl into his embrace. \"She's my granddaughter, my own granddaughter! No one is allowed to take her from me! I'd rather die than let anyone take her away!\"\n\n\"That zombie is already causing minor trouble in the village. If he's just trying to find his daughter, and you keep blocking him, it's very likely to drive him mad. Stealing a few chickens and ducks and the leaked malevolent aura causing nightmares are minor issues. Do you know what will happen if a zombie truly runs out of patience? You were born with Yin-Yang Eyes; you should know more about these things than ordinary people!\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at Old Man Cui.\n\n\"Let them die! Let them just die! A bunch of people who forget their roots!⁴ For a bit of demolition money, they abandon their ancestral graves! These people deserve to die! They deserve it, they deserve to die! Even if they all die, don't think I'll send Xiao Chai away! I can't possibly let Xiao Chai leave me!\"\n\n\"Grandpa, Xiao Chai doesn't want to leave Grandpa either. Xiao Chai wants to stay with you always.\"\n\nThe little girl and Old Man Cui hugged each other, crying bitterly.\n\n\"Is that why?\" Xu Qinglang whispered, leaning closer to Zhou Ze.\n\nIf the cause of all this was that Old Man Cui, with his innate Yin-Yang Eyes and utterly failed life, wanted this granddaughter, then handing the girl over seemed to be the most appropriate way to handle it. The village could avoid a disaster, and this girl, being a corporealized corpse fetus, couldn't be considered a living person anyway.\n\n\"The timing doesn't match,\" Zhou Ze said, shaking his head. \"The zombie's target should be this girl, but it might not be a so-called father-daughter or mother-daughter relationship. Didn't you hear the old man say he adopted this girl three years ago? If her parents were truly still alive, and if they truly became zombies, firstly, it would be difficult for her to escape by herself, and secondly, if she had been out for so long, her parents wouldn't have waited three years to come looking for her.\"\n\n\"Then how do you see it?\"\n\n\"The demolition of the ancestral graves, or perhaps even this very project, caused changes in the soil layers somewhere, releasing a zombie. There are truly many strange incidents caused by such large-scale projects; the Dragon Pillar of the Yan'an Road Viaduct in Shanghai is one example. Then, this zombie, driven by instinct, smelled the girl and wanted to eat her for nourishment.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you feel anything towards her?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Ancient people lived by 'eating raw meat and drinking blood,' and people in ancient times thanked heavens for a mouthful of rice bran. Modern people not only want to eat enough but also pursue eating well.\"\n\n\"So you're showing off your superior bloodline and still have to beat around the bush about it,\" Xu Qinglang said disdainfully.\n\nZhou Ze didn't argue further, because he knew the truth was, the real reason was that he wasn't in his zombie state right now. If he allowed the consciousness within him to awaken, he'd probably shove that girl into his mouth first. That consciousness seemed to enjoy consuming such unique departed souls to nourish itself.\n\n\"What about this corpse fetus? Can she be sent for reincarnation?\"\n\n\"Yes, she was also formed from a departed soul. It's just that her soul was contaminated with corpse energy, causing some changes. But in essence, she's still a departed soul. With some processing, she can still be sent to Hell for reincarnation. And the merit points for sending her down should be quite high.\"\n\n\"So, wait a bit longer? First, can you help me deal with that zombie?\"\n\nZhou Ze said nothing.\n\n\"Hey, give me a hand. You know how terrifying it was when we first saw Yingying. I can't handle it alone.\"\n\nZhou Ze still said nothing.\n\n\"This is my hometown, after all. I don't want to see people suffer untold miseries⁵ here.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, then lowered his head, staring at his shoetips. He scuffed his shoetips on the ground and said, \"Sigh, in my past life, I finally saved up enough to buy a house, but in this life, I don't even have a single one. What a failure.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Don't be like that, brother! You're looting a burning house!\"⁶ Xu Qinglang finally managed to blurt out.\n\n\"Then can you give me a better reason to convince me to act?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Damn it, when it comes down to it, aren't these all your relatives! Your relatives are causing trouble, can you just sit by and do nothing?\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n___\n¹ **\"mouth chewing mud\" (口啃泥, *kǒu kěn ní*)**: An idiom describing someone lying face down on the ground, often unable to speak clearly due to being incapacitated or defeated.\n² **\"salted fish\" (鹹魚, *xiányú*)**: An idiom used to describe someone who is lazy, unmotivated, listless, or has given up on aspirations.\n³ **\"If you are willing to peel open my heart layer by layer by layer\" (如果你願意一層一層一層的剝開我的心, *rúguǒ nǐ yuànyì yī céng yī céng yī céng de bāo kāi wǒ de xīn*)**: This is a line from the Chinese song \"帶我走\" (Take Me Away) by Rainie Yang, used here humorously/ominously.\n⁴ **\"forget their roots\" (數典忘祖, *shǔ diǎn wàng zǔ*)**: An idiom meaning to forget one's heritage, roots, or origins; to be ungrateful or disloyal to one's background.\n⁵ **\"people suffer untold miseries\" (生靈塗炭, *shēng líng tú tàn*)**: An idiom describing a situation where people are suffering terribly, often due to war, disaster, or misrule; a land laid to waste.\n⁶ **\"looting a burning house\" (趁火打劫, *chèn huǒ dǎ jié*)**: An idiom meaning to take advantage of someone's misfortune or a crisis for one's own gain.",

    "content": "Night fell, and the door of the small mud house was ajar.\n\nThe girl child was intentionally arranged by Zhou Ze to sit on the doorstep. As for Old Man Cui, Xu Qinglang tied him up with ropes, gagged him, and made him sit on a small stool in the living room.\n\nJust as Old Man Cui himself had said, he'd rather the entire village be slaughtered by zombies than have his \"granddaughter\" leave him.\n\nThis is human nature. Making such a choice and saying such words is unexceptionable, quite normal.\n\nTherefore, it was also quite normal and unexceptionable for Xu Qinglang to have the little girl stand outside as bait, to protect the village where he was born.\n\nZhou Ze intended to send the girl child to Hell for reincarnation after the matter was concluded, and this was also not wrong. After all, birth, old age, sickness, and death are natural laws. The little girl was already dead, so going to Hell to get a chance to reincarnate was the proper path; staying in the human realm would cause problems sooner or later.\n\nIf you, Old Man Cui, didn't care about the lives of the whole village, why should Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang care about your opinion?\n\nMost importantly, this old man's temper was truly hateful. Boss Zhou, at least, had no impulse whatsoever to do anything for him. It was best for everyone to conduct business as usual; there was no need to talk about favors and reciprocity, that was too much trouble.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang both stood behind the door, leaning against the doorframe.\n\n\"Will it come?\"\n\n\"It depends on whether this old fellow is hiding anything else,\" Zhou Ze glanced at Old Man Cui, who was tied up \"like a zongzi.\"¹\n\n\"What else could he be hiding?\"\n\n\"Someone who has had 'Yin-Yang Eyes'² since birth, living until now—could his life have been so calm and peaceful?\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\nWhen late night arrived, Xu Qinglang grew somewhat tired and sat directly on the floor, leaning against the wall. Zhou Ze was fine, smoking one cigarette after another. He didn't need coffee or anything to ward off sleepiness; anyway, without the freezer or Bai Yingying, he couldn't sleep.\n\nStill, waiting like this was quite boring.\n\nOld Man Cui, tired from his struggle, actually fell asleep first. The girl child, meanwhile, continued to sit obediently on the doorstep, constantly looking around, occasionally turning her head to check on her grandfather.\n\nBeing able to harden his heart and use a girl child as bait, Zhou Ze himself felt a touch of guilt. But you can't catch a wolf without sacrificing a cub.³ Moreover, the girl child was a \"corpse fetus,\"⁴ so there was no need to truly regard her as a pure child.\n\n\"Crunch... crunch...\"\n\nIn the distant vegetable patch, a sound appeared.\n\nZhou Ze immediately straightened up. Xu Qinglang, who had been dozing off slightly, also immediately stood up.\n\nThe girl child hugged her shoulders. She sensed the cold, and at the same time, she sensed fear.\n\n\"Crunch... crunch...\"\n\nThe sound grew closer.\n\nZhou Ze looked out through the crack in the door. For now, he could only hear the sound; he hadn't yet seen the hopping figure.\n\nThey waited for about another ten minutes. The sound was still circling nearby, hiding itself within the darkness, but it was slow to appear.\n\n\"Zombies have intelligence too, huh?\"\n\nXu Qinglang exclaimed.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nHowever, this was no time for arguing. The zombie might genuinely have sensed something amiss, which was why it temporarily dared not approach.\n\nThe girl child turned her head. Her fear grew heavier and heavier. She instinctively wanted to call out for her grandfather, but Zhou Ze, standing behind her, made a \"shush\" gesture. The girl child forced herself to hold back, but her eyes were red from holding it in.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze extended his palm, and nails grew on it. Layers of black mist began to swirl. Zhou Ze crouched down and plunged his nails into the ground.\n\nThe black mist began to spread out, pointing in a direction!\n\n\"Over there!\"\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze directly rushed out over the doorstep.\n\nSince that thing was slow to come, he might as well take the initiative. Just dealing with one zombie, Boss Zhou truly didn't feel there was anything to be afraid of.\n\nBack when he and Bai Yingying had their first encounter, Bai Yingying's aura was like Wu Zetian presiding over court. Wasn't she ultimately *poked until she cried*⁵ by him?\n\nAhead was a vegetable patch, simply fenced off. As Zhou Ze rushed over, a figure also actively \"leaped\" over.\n\nIndeed, it leaped. The opponent was wearing a black T-shirt and shorts. As it leaped out, it broke all the surrounding fences.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze's body collided with the other's. From the opponent's body came a hardness similar to steel plate, and the opponent's charge did not diminish, carrying a terrifying resolve.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's nails also smoothly pierced into the opponent's chest. Before his nails, even the hardest chest had to turn 'soft as silk around the finger'.⁶\n\n\"Squelch!\"\n\nIt felt like a finger being plunged into a split-open watermelon—sticky, yielding, and with a thick consistency.\n\nThe opponent's body trembled, then twisted directly, curling up on the ground, like a leech sprinkled with salt.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nXu Qinglang also ran over.\n\n\"Dealt with.\"\n\nZhou Ze crouched down beside the man. The man had gradually stopped twitching, and black mist began to rise from his body.\n\nTaking out his phone and shining it on the man's face, Zhou Ze realized he had seen this man during the day; he was one of the villagers who went into the water to save the drowning woman.\n\nHow could it be him?\n\nBy now, the man had no breath left, and his body began to soften. Black pus-blood began to seep from his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.\n\nBeing directly pierced by Zhou Ze's nails was equivalent to disrupting his foundation. Even Bai Yingying, back then, found it unbearable when Zhou Ze's nails merely grazed her, let alone this guy, who clearly couldn't compare to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"I know this person.\" Xu Qinglang also took out his phone and shined a light. \"He's Aunt Xu's third son, named...\"\n\n\"I know him too.\"\n\nZhou Ze interrupted Xu Qinglang, then turned the man's neck over.\n\nOn the left side of his neck, there were two distinct teeth marks.\n\nZhou Ze's fingers rubbed over the teeth marks, then his gaze suddenly sharpened:\n\n\"No, this is a proxy, just bitten by the zombie and controlled to become a 'walking corpse'!\"\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze immediately stood up and rushed back to the small mud house. The girl child, who had been sitting on the doorstep, was already gone.\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze rushed into the house, Old Man Cui, who Xu Qinglang had tied up like a zongzi, was also gone. Only a coil of rope and a small stool remained in his place.\n\nThey fell for it. They actually fell for it.\n\nWhen Xu Qinglang ran back and saw the empty scene inside the house, he also frowned deeply.\n\n\"How is this possible...\"\n\nXu Qinglang was somewhat incredulous.\n\nThis zombie wasn't Zhou Ze, nor was it Bai Yingying, who had been nourished by Lady Bai for two hundred years. Yet, it could play the trick of 'luring the tiger away from its mountain lair'⁷?\n\n\"This old man was also eaten by the zombie?\" Xu Qinglang muttered to himself.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nZhou Ze crouched down and picked up the ropes scattered on the ground.\n\n\"The rope's break point shows signs of repeated cutting; it wasn't snapped by a zombie's nails. The old man broke free himself.\"\n\nSaying this, Zhou Ze stood up. He first looked in the direction outside,\n\n\"We were just in the vegetable patch ahead. If the old man had run out of the house, there's no way we wouldn't have known. Moreover, knowing there was a zombie outside eyeing him menacingly, he shouldn't have been so foolish as to rush out and attempt to escape. At least inside the house, we could still ensure his and his granddaughter's safety.\"\n\nHearing this, Xu Qinglang first walked over to the kitchen to look, then walked over to the bedroom, and then pointed to the bed's location and shouted:\n\n\"Under here, there's a tunnel!\"\n\nZhou Ze got up and walked over. Sure enough, the bed was overturned, and there really was a tunnel underneath.\n\nA lonely old man, with only a ghost granddaughter for company, and with a terrible reputation in the village—what was he digging a tunnel for?\n\nCould it be that Old Man Cui, enchanted by 'Tunnel Warfare'⁸ in his youth, made one for his own house when he had nothing to do?\n\n\"You go deal with that corpse first, bring it into the house and hide it well. I'll follow the tunnel to pursue. Be careful.\"\n\nZhou Ze instructed Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. That 'walking corpse' had just been killed by Zhou Ze, but leaving the body exposed outside like that would inevitably cause a big commotion when villagers passed by at daybreak. It indeed needed someone to deal with it first.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang left, Zhou Ze alone jumped into the tunnel. The tunnel wasn't wide; most areas required bending over or even crawling to pass through.\n\nAnd the tunnel was truly not short.\n\nZhou Ze even began to admire the old bachelor's nocturnal activities. Others plowed fields and sowed seeds; he dug holes here.\n\nAbout four minutes later, the tunnel began to ascend. Zhou Ze also found friction marks indicating someone had just passed through here. The trapdoor above was also open, and Zhou Ze easily walked out.\n\nUpon entering, Zhou Ze was surprised to find that this was also an old tiled house, very dilapidated, and it didn't seem like anyone would visit frequently.\n\nThere were many such houses in the countryside; they were usually for the elderly. After the elderly passed away, the younger generation would have long since moved into newly built multi-story homes. These old houses were either used as kitchens or as places to store miscellaneous items.\n\nSure enough, when Zhou Ze turned a corner and entered the hall, he saw a spirit altar. On it were two unlit candles, covered in cobwebs. Between the candles was an incense ash burner, and behind it was a black and white photograph of an old woman.\n\nThe old woman was showing her white teeth, smiling very happily.\n\nOld Man Cui's tunnel led here. Could it be that this old woman was Old Man Cui's mistress when she was alive?\n\nPerhaps the old woman had been widowed for a long time but had children, making it inconvenient for her to be with Old Man Cui. In the countryside, finding another partner for widowed parents is a very difficult matter, primarily because the children feel it would cause them to \"lose face.\"\n\nBut Old Man Cui's spirit of digging tunnels for secret rendezvous was truly touching.\n\nHowever, things change and people pass on. The old woman had passed away first. It's estimated that Old Man Cui hadn't used this tunnel for a long time. This time, it was purely a means of escaping and transferring.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and passed through the hall. He now needed to find Old Man Cui as quickly as possible, because he knew that the intelligent zombie was also looking for the grandfather and granddaughter.\n\nMoreover, that zombie had only been 'stealing chickens and dogs'⁹ at first, but now it had started killing!\n\nWhat Zhou Ze didn't see was that after he passed through the hall, on the cobweb-covered spirit altar, the old woman in the black and white photograph, who was already smiling, had an even broader smile.\n\n---\n¹ **Zongzi (粽子):** A traditional Chinese sticky rice dumpling wrapped in bamboo leaves, often tightly bound with string. The comparison implies Old Man Cui was very securely tied up.\n² **Yin-Yang Eyes (陰陽眼):** A supernatural ability to see spirits and the spiritual world.\n³ **You can't catch a wolf without sacrificing a cub (捨不得孩子套不住狼):** A Chinese idiom meaning that you must be willing to pay a price or take a risk to achieve a significant goal.\n⁴ **Corpse Fetus (屍胎):** In Chinese folklore, a fetus that has died in the womb but remains animated by some supernatural force, often linked to the undead.\n⁵ **Poked until she cried (插到哭):** A double entendre.

    "content": "In the lonely little mud house,\n\nXu Qinglang fell into deep thought.\n\nBefore him,\n\nlay the corpse he had just dragged back from the vegetable patch outside.\n\nHe knew this corpse; it was Aunt Xu’s third son from the village, not yet thirty this year, unmarried, usually working at the shipyard, and well-regarded in the village because he was always willing to help.\n\nIf anyone in the village, from east to west, needed help, he'd be sure to come. For example, if one family needed to repair their house, or another was short on time to harvest wheat, the only payment he received was a meal and some wine.\n\nThis was a spirit of mutual help among neighbors, typical of the older generation, now quite rare among the young. Yet, he preserved it, and many of his peers thought him naive.\n\nOf course, no matter how good his reputation, it had little to do with Xu Qinglang. Although Xu Qinglang was born in the village, he had left it a long time ago.\n\nNow was not the time for sorrow, remembrance, or holding a memorial service.\n\nHe had to find a way to dispose of this corpse first.\n\nXu Qinglang remembered watching *The Deer and the Cauldron* in the past, where Wei Xiaobao had a bone-dissolving liquid. A few drops poured on a person would immediately corrode them completely. Xu Qinglang wasn't sure if such a thing existed in reality, but he knew he didn't have time to look for it now.\n\nOr perhaps,\n\ndismemberment?\n\nDismantle the corpse bit by bit, maybe even stir-fry some parts?\n\nThat seems a bit perverse.\n\nBut why did he suddenly feel an urge to try it?\n\nIt must have been Zhou Ze, that pervert, who infected him.\n\nShaking his head, Xu Qinglang decided to use the clumsiest method first:\n\ndig a pit,\n\nand bury the corpse.\n\nLater, he could burn some hell money*. Then this matter should pass. After all, although Zhou Ze killed the person, this guy was already a walking corpse when he was killed. He was already dead. Zhou Ze killing him was equivalent to giving him liberation.\n\nXu Qinglang fetched a shovel from the house, went to the vegetable patch in front of the door, and began to dig.\n\nActually, the mud house didn't have any tiles or cement laid; it was just dirt floor. But after years of people walking back and forth, the dirt had been compacted so tightly that it was impossible to dig.\n\nAs he dug, Xu Qinglang leaned on the shovel with both hands, panting uncontrollably. For someone who rarely did manual labor and had recently started to take care of himself, this kind of work was truly difficult to bear.\n\n“Oooooh…ooooh…”\n\nIn the distance, a faint whimpering sound seemed to drift, a bit like someone crying, but upon closer listening, it wasn’t quite crying. The tune had a certain rise and fall, a winding and drawn-out quality.\n\nNights in the countryside were still very quiet, especially at this hour. Where could such a sound be coming from?\n\nXu Qinglang instinctively reached into his pocket and touched the heart-protecting mirror. To be honest, with Boss Zhou not by his side, Xu Qinglang felt genuinely uneasy, a constant sense of unsettlement.\n\nThe whimpering sound drew closer. Xu Qinglang abruptly raised his shovel. Although he only heard the sound and saw nothing, the sense of danger was so intense that it spurred his adrenaline to surge wildly.\n\n“Hoo…hoo…hoo…”\n\nDeep breaths,\n\nconstant deep breaths,\n\nXu Qinglang held the shovel in one hand and gripped the heart-protecting mirror in the other.\n\nCould it be that Old Zhou hadn’t caught the zombie, and it had returned for a surprise attack?\n\nThe atmosphere,\n\ngrew incredibly tense,\n\ncold sweat began to trickle down Xu Qinglang’s forehead.\n\nStandoff,\n\nconfrontation,\n\ncontinued.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes,\n\nin the dark night, a few mischievous crows, not sleeping, flew overhead,\n\nmaking sounds of “Caw…caw…caw…”\n\nA gust of wind blew,\n\na few fallen leaves swirled and blew past him.\n\nXu Qinglang and the air,\n\nhad been in a standoff for twenty minutes.\n\nThe whimpering sound gradually faded, eventually becoming imperceptible.\n\nAfter listening for so long, Xu Qinglang at least confirmed one thing: it definitely wasn't someone crying. Instead, it sounded more like someone idly playing a *xiao*^1 in the dead of night.\n\nWho the hell has that much time on their hands!\n\nHe waited cautiously for a while longer. Only when the sound completely vanished did Xu Qinglang let out a long sigh of relief, the alarm dismissed.\n\nHe continued digging for a while longer. He had originally wanted to dig deeper, but exhaustion had set in, so he just dug a passable depth. Anyway, future troubles would still have to be averted with hell money; burying the corpse now was just to prevent it from being discovered by villagers in the near future.\n\nStepping into the house, the corpse still lay quietly there. There was a clear indentation on its chest, surrounded by five small holes.\n\nZombies were definitely very hard.\n\nIn fact, if a dead body is preserved well, the rigor mortis makes it much \"tougher\" than when alive. And zombies, being formed from pent-up resentment, have even more solid bodies.\n\nBut even such a solid body was directly pierced through by Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\nXu Qinglang took a sip of water, took out his phone, and prepared to send Zhou Ze a message, asking him where he was and if he had found Old Man Cui.\n\nHe who hunts geese all day will eventually be pecked by a goose^2.\n\nNeither Xu Qinglang nor Zhou Ze had expected that Old Man Cui, with his awful temper, would play a trick like 'crossing the Wei River under cover'^3. He first feigned sleep and secretly, with who-knows-what, cut the ropes, then, while the walking corpse appeared and he and Zhou Ze rushed out to deal with it, he decisively escaped through an underground passage with his granddaughter.\n\nWhy the old man escaped was simple: because the two of them had used his precious granddaughter as bait, and Zhou Ze had also planned to send his granddaughter to reincarnation after the matter was resolved.\n\nIt could only be said that Zhou Ze was right earlier: someone with natural Yin-Yang Eyes^4, living to such an old age, if they didn't have a few hidden tricks up their sleeve, it would be hard for others to believe.\n\n“Why is there no signal?”\n\nXu Qinglang tapped his phone.\n\nIt was at this moment that the corpse, which had been lying there stone-dead, slowly sat up.\n\nSilently,\n\nwithout making a single sound.\n\nXu Qinglang continued fiddling with his phone. He wanted to contact Zhou Ze as soon as possible, completely oblivious to what was happening behind him.\n\nIt wasn't that Xu Qinglang was particularly careless. In fact, even Zhou Ze himself wouldn't have thought that the walking corpse, already stabbed to death by his fingernails, could stir up any more trouble.\n\nBut inexplicably,\n\nit got up.\n\nAnd it slowly opened its mouth,\n\nrevealing two sinister fangs.\n\n“Hmm?” Xu Qinglang sniffed. Why was there suddenly a smell of pickled garlic?\n\nHaving been a chef before, his natural sensitivity to smells made Xu Qinglang subconsciously glance back at this moment,\n\nand then,\n\ntheir eyes met!\n\nThe corpse lunged forward, its fangs directly piercing Xu Qinglang’s neck.\n\nXu Qinglang frantically pushed and struck the thing in front of him, but it clung to him like a caterpillar, refusing to let go.\n\nEnduring the intense pain in his neck,\n\nXu Qinglang took out the heart-protecting mirror from his pocket,\n\nand uttered in a low voice:\n\n“Heaven and Earth Without Limit, Profound Heart Righteous Law!”\n\nA layer of faint blue ripples shimmered on the mirror surface of the heart-protecting mirror.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nXu Qinglang directly slammed the heart-protecting mirror onto the thing in front of him.\n\nThe thing's body trembled ceaselessly, as if in great pain, but it still bit Xu Qinglang tightly, refusing to let go. Its hands and feet began to climb over him, like an octopus, trying to 'force the issue'^5!\n\nWith a “thud,”\n\nXu Qinglang was indeed pinned to the ground by it,\n\nits body constantly trembling and writhing,\n\nrubbing Xu Qinglang against the ground with full abandon!\n\nNausea,\n\nrevulsion,\n\ndiscomfort,\n\npain,\n\nache…………\n\nXu Qinglang knew that unless Zhou Ze could arrive at the last minute like a Hong Kong movie cop, he would very likely meet his end here today.\n\nBut this thing,\n\nwas clearly stone-cold dead,\n\nhow could it move again?\n\nRight,\n\nit was the *xiao*^1 music!\n\nIt must be related to that *xiao*^1 music!\n\nBut it was too late to think about any *xiao*^1 music now, and it had no meaning anyway.\n\nFor the first time,\n\nXu Qinglang felt that the village where he was born was so alien and terrifying to him, as if a curtain had always obscured it, and he had never truly stepped inside.\n\nStruggling desperately with both hands,\n\nXu Qinglang touched an indented spot,\n\nthe place where Zhou Ze's fingernails had pierced through earlier.\n\n“Heaven and Earth Without Limit, Profound Heart Righteous Law!”\n\nXu Qinglang chanted the incantation one last time,\n\nand with a grit of his teeth,\n\nhe directly shoved his heart-protecting mirror into the walking corpse's chest through that wound.\n\n“Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss…”\n\nBlack mist began to continuously emit from the walking corpse's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. It leaped off Xu Qinglang, then fell to the ground and thrashed wildly, like a bug sprayed with pesticide, making its final struggles.\n\nThe heart-protecting mirror continuously emitted blue light inside the walking corpse's body, ceaselessly incinerating it.\n\nIn the end,\n\nthe walking corpse lay motionless on the ground once more. Moreover, its body slowly began to decay, turning into a puddle of putrid liquid.\n\nSoon,\n\nwhen the liquid was absorbed by the dirt floor,\n\nonly a clear human-shaped stain remained on the ground.\n\nWei Xiaobao's bone-dissolving liquid, which Xu Qinglang had been longing for, had truly become a reality this time.\n\nBending down, Xu Qinglang used his sleeve to cover his hand and uncovered the blackish thing in the middle of the human-shaped stain. It was his heart-protecting mirror, but now it had completely turned to charcoal.\n\nXu Qinglang had a shallow foundation; his mystic arts were only 'half a bucket of water'^6. This small magical artifact was already one of the few things he could produce, and now it was completely ruined.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis was not the most troublesome part.\n\nXu Qinglang picked up his phone and went to the broken mirror in the main hall.\n\nHe turned on his phone's rear flashlight and shined it on his neck.\n\nIn the mirror,\n\non the left side of his neck,\n\nthere was a very clear pair of tooth marks.\n\nThe surrounding flesh was also torn open, but no fresh blood flowed out. Instead, black specks continuously rolled within, looking utterly repulsive.\n\nXu Qinglang gently touched his wound with a trembling hand.\n\nAn ominous premonition,\n\nslowly crept in…………\n\n---\n^1 A Chinese vertical end-blown flute.\n^2 An idiom meaning that if one constantly harms others or engages in risky behavior, they will eventually suffer the consequences; what goes around comes around.\n^3 A stratagem meaning to openly do one thing while secretly doing another, or to make a feint in one direction while attacking in another. Often implies a hidden or deceptive maneuver.\n^4 In Chinese folklore, a spiritual ability to perceive ghosts, spirits, or other supernatural entities that are normally invisible to the human eye.\n^5 An idiom for forcefully taking advantage of someone, often in a sexual context, but here implying forceful subjugation.\n^6 An idiom describing someone with superficial knowledge or limited skill, akin to \"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\"",

    "content": "In many rural areas of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, the layout of houses is such that one side is an old single-story house, and the other side is a multi-story building of two floors or more. The older generation generally lives in the single-story house, while the next generation and younger ones live in the multi-story building.\n\nAfter the elders pass away, the single-story house is either kept as a storage room or directly torn down and rebuilt into a new single-story house for use as a kitchen or similar.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze walked out of the single-story house, what he saw was a three-story Western-style villa. In front of the entrance was a large courtyard, and beyond that, a fish pond they had built themselves.\n\nIt was surrounded by farmland. Although this is common in rural areas, from another perspective, it was a genuine countryside villa.\n\nOld Man Cui must have arrived here after emerging from the tunnel of his mud house. But now the question was, where did Old Man Cui go after leaving this single-story house?\n\nUnder the cover of night, if Old Man Cui took his daughter and hid in any random corner of the fields, Zhou Ze would really have a hard time finding him.\n\nThe people in the multi-story building hadn't gone to bed yet. It was already late at night, and sounds of drinking and laughter were still coming from inside.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the courtyard in front of the building and lit a cigarette. The events of the night had left him feeling a bit annoyed. Perhaps for Boss Zhou now, sitting in his bookstore, waiting for willing customers to take the bait, was the most pleasant thing.\n\nThis was like those small slips of paper slipped under hotel doors; the person who arrived after you called would definitely not be as pretty as in the photo, but at least they guaranteed plug-and-play.\n\nIf you went out to find them yourself, searching place by place, without a membership card or being a regular customer, they might not even bother with you, telling you that their service was absolutely legitimate, as pure as a delicate white lotus.\n\nBut just as Zhou Ze was smoking,\n\nhis nose suddenly twitched.\n\nIt wasn't that Boss Zhou's nose had evolved into a dog's, but rather that his identity in his previous life made him extremely sensitive to a certain smell,\n\nand that was the smell of disinfectant!\n\nAt this very moment, the smell of disinfectant was emanating from this house, causing Zhou Ze to involuntarily turn around and face the building. He dropped the cigarette he was holding, stepped on it with the sole of his shoe, walked to the side door, used his fingernail to open the door lock, pushed open the door, and went inside.\n\nThe first floor seemed to contain the kitchen and living room. The side room Zhou Ze was in also had a large corn drying area.\n\nOnly in the countryside could one be so extravagant with living space.\n\nAt the corner of the living room, there was a staircase leading to the second floor.\n\nThe laughter was coming from the second floor. Zhou Ze slowly walked up, and the smell of disinfectant grew increasingly strong.\n\n\"Why hasn't Third Brother arrived yet? Didn't we say we'd drink and watch the game tonight?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Maybe some widow asked him to fix her toilet again, hahahaha.\"\n\n\"That Third Brother, he's just too warm-hearted. He'll do anything you ask him to, truly foolish.\"\n\n\"You're so naive. Let me tell you, Third Brother is shrewd to the core. Who knows how many young wives' doors he's knocked on?\"\n\nIn the living room, three men were sitting, watching TV and drinking. On the small table, there were snacks like pig's head meat and peanuts. The atmosphere was very lively.\n\n\"Oh, it's in! Hahahaha, it's really in!\"\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\n\"I told you not to bet on Saudi Arabia, but you just had to. Saudi Arabia is an Asian minnow team, and Russia is a European minnow team. Although they're both minnows, there's still a big difference. If you let our National Team play against Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia would still have 60-40 odds.\"\n\n\"Didn't our National Team beat Saudi Arabia in the last Asian Cup?\"\n\n\"Right, in the last Asian Cup, Wang Dalei first saved a penalty kick, and then Yu Hai's free kick deflected in. They won one-nil, I think.\"\n\n\"I just saw the high odds and wanted to try for an upset, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Bro, Shunzi, you two keep it down. Sis-in-law and the kids are still sleeping in there, aren't they?\"\n\n\"It's fine. Big men watching a game at night, what's a woman going to say? It's not a big deal, not a big deal.\"\n\nThe three men were shirtless, watching the game and shooting the breeze. Zhou Ze came up the stairs, didn't enter the living room, but instead turned and walked towards the rooms on the other side.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze smelled an even stranger scent,\n\nthe same kind of smell that made Zhou Ze's profession in his previous life highly sensitive,\n\nthe smell of fresh blood.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door. Heh, to be honest, it really felt like something out of a rural erotic novella, sneaking into a neighbor's house in the middle of the night for a secret rendezvous.\n\nHowever, Boss Zhou had no such thoughts at the moment, as the fishy smell of blood was growing increasingly strong.\n\nThe lights were off in the room. The furnishings were simple: a large bed, cabinets, and similar items. The area was quite spacious.\n\nAs soon as Zhou Ze stepped inside, he stopped.\n\nUnder his feet, he seemed to have stepped on something, and it felt a bit sticky.\n\nReaching out, Zhou Ze fumbled along the wall next to the door for a while and found the light switch.\n\n\"Click!\"\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nZhou Ze turned on the light.\n\nA pool of blood had dripped down from the bed, slowly spreading across the floor, and Zhou Ze's shoe sole had landed right on the slowly flowing blood.\n\nOn the bed, there appeared to be a mother and child. Their bodies were twisted in death, their demise extremely gruesome, as if they had been gnawed by a wild beast, and a gnawing with a strong sense of vengeance.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and examined them. He wasn't a police officer, nor did he handle criminal investigations. He just wanted to first confirm what kind of thing had done this,\n\nwas it a human,\n\nor something else?\n\nAfter observing the wounds, Zhou Ze found that the mother and child on the bed had been bitten to death, and in an extremely swift manner.\n\nThe most ridiculous thing was,\n\nthe woman's husband and the child's father,\n\nwere currently in the living room, drinking with his two friends and watching the game, completely unaware of the tragedy that had occurred in the bedroom.\n\n\"I'm going to the toilet. Damn it, Saudi Arabia made me lose money.\"\n\nOne of the men went directly to the second-floor bathroom.\n\n\"Bro, you bet on 4-0, right?\"\n\n\"Right, 4-0.\"\n\n\"Just one more goal needed.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, it's possible. Saudi Arabia has already collapsed, they've lost confidence.\"\n\nAs the game neared its end, Russia scored another goal, making the score 4-0.\n\n\"Yes! Yes!\"\n\nThe male host clenched his fists and shouted.\n\nThe man next to him saw that his friend had won, and felt a bit sour. He had also placed a bet, but it had gone bust, so he could only say helplessly:\n\n\"How come Shunzi went to the toilet and hasn't come back yet? I'll go check on him, hope he hasn't done something foolish and killed himself in the toilet.\"\n\nIn the living room, only the male host remained. He was happily drinking and eating peanuts by himself, feeling absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe game was already in stoppage time, and the situation was pretty much set. He could just wait to collect his winnings.\n\nHe had won money on the World Cup opening match, which proved his luck had been very good lately.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze continued to examine the situation in the bedroom. One thing was now certain: this should be the work of a zombie. But this particular zombie's habits felt somewhat unfamiliar to him.\n\nCompletely unlike Bai Yingying and himself, this zombie possessed an extremely strong subjective nature, including using ghouls to lure him and Xu Qinglang out. From another perspective, it truly helped Old Man Cui 'deceive the heavens and cross the sea'.¹\n\nSubsequently, the tragic deaths of the female host and child in this house, under the zombie's fangs, also seemed to portend something.\n\nXu Qinglang's hometown, why is there so much messy business?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head impatiently.\n\nHe covered the deceased on the bed with a blanket, turned off the light, and concealed himself in the darkness. He could feel that the thing, like himself, was also hidden in a corner of the house.\n\nKilling just two people probably isn't enough to satisfy it, is it?\n\nThere were still three men in this house, with the most vigorous vitality. Go on, I'm waiting for you.\n\nUsing people as bait was not new to Zhou Ze; he had done it before with the little girl, and although an accident occurred, it wouldn't deter Zhou Ze from choosing to do it again.\n\nIf he were to rashly intervene, warn the people here, and let the thing hidden in the darkness escape, God only knew where it would flee to. He didn't have that much time to play hide-and-seek with it.\n\nTime,\n\nslowly passed.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze heard movement from the distant bathroom. Everything happened in an instant, but Zhou Ze sensed it. He immediately bypassed the living room and rushed from the side towards the bathroom's direction.\n\nThe bathroom door was open. Inside was a squat toilet, no Western-style toilet.\n\nAs Zhou Ze arrived, he just happened to see a dark figure dart out from the front. As Zhou Ze passed the bathroom doorway, he saw two male corpses lying crossed over the squat toilet area, their bellies ripped open with large holes, and their intestines pulled out.\n\nSo fast,\n\ntruly fast,\n\nThis speed,\n\nmade even Zhou Ze feel somewhat incredulous. The ghouls he had dealt with before were simply not in the same league as this true form.\n\nZhou Ze was the one fishing, but the fish had swallowed the bait with extreme speed and run off before he could even reel in his line.\n\n............\n\nThe male host had no idea that strangers had entered his home,\n\nand what's more, the ones who had entered,\n\nwere two zombies.\n\nHe was still drinking, leisurely waiting for the game to end. Only one minute remained. It was so good, so good.\n\nBut just at this moment,\n\nRussian player Golovin's free kick soared over the wall and flew straight into the top corner. The Saudi goalkeeper was too far to reach it, and the score was rewritten to '5-0'!\n\n\"Shit!\"\n\nIn a fit of anger, the male host swept the plate of peanuts in front of him directly onto the floor.\n\nHis prize money had flown away,\n\nand at the very last moment before the referee blew the whistle,\n\nhe truly felt incredibly frustrated.\n\n\"Damn it, you two! Are you rotting in the toilet or what?!\"\n\nSeeing that his two friends hadn't returned from the toilet, the male host couldn't help but curse.\n\nHe propped his feet on the coffee table and lit a cigarette. He was truly annoyed, very, very annoyed.\n\nBefore the cigarette was even lit,\n\nsuddenly,\n\nthe male host heard a sound from under the coffee table,\n\nlike a mouse eating something.\n\n\"Shit, what the hell is that?!\"\n\nThe man took his feet down,\n\nand lowered his head to look underneath.\n\nSomething was indeed eating,\n\nAs the man peered underneath,\n\nhe saw a hunched woman in a burial shroud, her head buried as she ate the peanuts and pig's head meat he had just swept off the table.\n\nThe woman froze for a moment,\n\nthen turned her head,\n\nand looked at him.\n\nIt was a terrifying face,\n\nwith white hair,\n\nher lips were covered in blood, and her eyes gleamed with a dark red luster. Yet, she naturally held a curve at the corner of her lips, just like in her black-and-white photographs.\n\nShe was smiling,\n\nshe loved to smile,\n\nshe was smiling in every photograph,\n\nso after her death, when her son went to enlarge her posthumous photo, he found all the photos were of her smiling, and he could only reluctantly choose one.\n\nUpon seeing this scene, the male host,\n\ntrembled in fear,\n\nhis mouth agape,\n\ncould only utter one word after a long moment:\n\n\"Mom...\"\n___\n¹*Deceive the heavens and cross the sea*: A Chinese idiom (one of the Thirty-Six Stratagems) referring to using subterfuge, where one acts openly but conceals their true intention, or uses a seemingly obvious move to distract from a hidden agenda.",

This impact was extremely powerful; he didn't know how many ribs were broken, and lying on the ground, he couldn't get up for a moment.\n\n\"Mom, Mom, don't come over, don't come over, don't come over!!!\"\n\nThe male host cried out, kneeling on the ground.\n\nThis was like playing hide-and-seek with his mother when he was little.\n\nBut this son was a bit too old.\n\nAnd this mother was a bit too agile.\n\nMother's love is like a mountain,\n\nIt's really going to,\n\ncrush you to death!\n\nThe old woman leaped up, opened her mouth, revealing terrifying and sinister fangs. Between her fangs and lips, uncongealed blood continuously flowed and dripped—that was the blood of her daughter-in-law, the blood of her grandson!\n\nTowards her son, she seemed even more frantic and even more impatient, like a grand feast, first tasting the preceding dishes one by one, and only when the grand finale dish was served would the entire banquet truly reach its high... climax!\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nA black mist suddenly rose up, sweeping the old woman. The old woman let out a piercing shriek like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, and her figure recoiled.\n\nWhat was even more exaggerated was,\n\nshe actually climbed onto the wall, tilting her head to observe the situation, and her movement technique was very stable.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the living room, looking at the old woman on the wall, a solemn expression on his face. This old woman's speed was much faster than he had anticipated.\n\n\"Save me... save me...\"\n\nThe male host lay on the ground, reaching out to Zhou Ze for help.\n\n\"She's your mom?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She's my mom.\" The male host nodded.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked again at the old woman on the wall.\n\nSo, is that blood revenge?\n\nGenerally speaking, if an ancestor buried underground reanimates as a zombie, what it can most easily sense should be those with direct blood ties to it. For them, who have just become zombies, it's like a bright lamp in the dark night, guiding them to go forth and kill them.\n\nIn fact, this can also be understood as a severance of old ties by a new life.\n\n\"My mom is dead, she's been dead for several years.\" The male host cried out to Zhou Ze; his worldview had already collapsed.\n\nFor an ordinary person, to see their mother, who died many years ago, suddenly appear before them and try to kill them—such a mental shock is enough to make one break down.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the son who was muttering to himself beside him.\n\nInstead, he pointed at the old woman on the wall who was peering at them.\n\n\"Do you want to kill him?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the male host.\n\n\"Then come down and kill him.\"\n\nThe old woman remained cautious and did not advance. Her eyes occasionally lingered on Zhou Ze's fingernails. Evidently, she was very wary of this thing.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit troubled.\n\nHe had truly never seen such an agile zombie. Even Bai Yingying, her characteristic only manifested in her immense strength, but it was unrealistic to expect Bai Yingying to scale walls.\n\nBut this old woman in front of him had done it; she appeared even more flexible. If not for the intense corpse aura emanating from her, Zhou Ze would have started to wonder if this damned thing was a zombie or a monkey immortal possessing someone.\n\nIt was tough.\n\nThe other party was on the wall.\n\nBoss Zhou didn't know *Qinggong*, so he couldn't get up there.\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze also understood why he hadn't encountered the old woman earlier. The old woman had probably been moving back and forth on the exterior walls of the house previously, waiting for an opportunity to enter and kill. She didn't need to enter through the door like him at all.\n\n\"Hey, are you going to kill him or not?\"\n\nZhou Ze lifted the male host from the ground.\n\nShaking him,\n\n\"Come kill him, I'm letting you kill him, really, I'm not lying, come on, come down.\"\n\n\"............\" The male host.\n\nThe old woman still didn't come down. She was wary of Zhou Ze, afraid of Zhou Ze. This fear even suppressed her impulse to kill her own son.\n\n\"Hey, call out 'Mom' a few more times, call your mom over.\"\n\nZhou Ze said to the male host.\n\nThe male host grimaced.\n\nHe always felt that something wasn't quite right.\n\n\"Who are you...?\" The male host asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I told you to call 'Mom', why are you asking so many questions?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze slapped the male host across the face, then looked back at the old woman on the wall.\n\n\"Hey, if you don't come down, I'll 'tear up the ticket' on your son!\"¹\n\nThe old woman slightly twisted her head, continuing to watch from the sidelines.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, throwing the male host back onto the ground. It was at this moment that the old woman suddenly moved. She had originally been on the side of the wall; now she directly gecko-crawled,\n\nmoving across the ceiling, and then dropping vertically!\n\nHer speed was astonishingly fast.\n\nSure enough, mothers are always most reluctant to let go of their sons.\n\nZhou Ze's figure paused, then his hands spread open upwards, his ten fingernails instantly grew long, transforming into a scythe-like length, and he thrust them directly upwards!\n\nThe old woman came like the wind. When she saw Zhou Ze's terrifying fingernails, she was completely stunned, but her momentum could no longer be stopped, nor could it be slowed.\n\n\"Whoosh... whoosh...\"\n\nThe fingernails ripped open her body, piercing into her so decisively, so smoothly, without the slightest resistance. When it came to fighting zombies, Zhou Ze was more professional than plants.\n\nEver had toothpick meat?\n\nZhou Ze now felt like the worker in the back of a *chuanchuanxiang*² restaurant skewering meat.\n\nThe old woman's chest area was completely pierced by his ten fingernails. At the same time, as the old woman slid down, she, not yet completely dead, actually opened her mouth and tried to bite Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze immediately took a side step and swung his arms downwards. The old woman was fiercely flung away by Zhou Ze, knocking over the television and landing on the ground.\n\nShe tried to get up, but it seemed very difficult, yet her eyes remained fixed on her son.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the yellowish-green liquid flowing from his fingernails, feeling utterly disgusted. Now he just wanted to quickly get rid of this old woman and then fix his fingernails.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked towards the old woman again, someone rushed up from the stairwell.\n\nIt was actually Cui Laotou!\n\nCui Laotou saw Zhou Ze, then raised his arm; in his hand, he held an axe.\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\n\nCui Laotou unhesitatingly threw the axe at Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze, with a swing of his fingernails, parried the axe. But in the next moment, Cui Laotou took out something he was carrying on his back; it was actually a crossbow!\n\nA crossbow often seen in amusement parks for shooting balloons and winning prizes.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nA crisp twang.\n\nBoss Zhou, who had just parried the axe, hadn't had time to react. He only felt a sudden heavy impact in his chest, and after staggering back two steps, he was forced to kneel on the ground.\n\n\"Ahhhhh!!!!\"\n\nThe old woman struggled, crawling on the ground with her hands. She didn't dare to charge towards the living room again; instead, she charged towards Cui Laotou's position. However, she did not attack Cui Laotou, but instead, clamping the skinny Cui Laotou with her arm, she directly jumped off the balcony.\n\nZhou Ze only heard a series of \"thudding\" sounds; those two guys must have landed.\n\nEnduring the pain in his chest, Zhou Ze stood up, chasing towards the balcony. A poor wretch like Cui Laotou naturally couldn't afford high-end stuff; otherwise, what Cui Laotou would have been holding when he appeared wouldn't have been a crossbow arrow, but an RPG!\n\nMoreover,\n\nthis crossbow arrow wasn't a genuine article either. It was probably genuinely stolen by Cui Laotou from an amusement park. The shot arrow only had its arrowhead pierce Zhou Ze's body and didn't cause much damage.\n\nHowever,\n\nwhen Zhou Ze reached the balcony, ready to jump down and continue the chase,\n\nhis body suddenly stumbled.\n\nHe actually collapsed onto his knees.\n\nHis vision began to spin.\n\nHis mind began to fall into a daze.\n\nF*ck,\n\nthis old man,\n\nput medicine on the arrowhead.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes flashed red.\n\nHe subconsciously wanted to enter that state again to continue the chase.\n\nIn fact,\n\nZhou Ze knew clearly that once he entered that state, that Cui Laotou and the old woman definitely wouldn't escape, but Zhou Ze didn't dare, nor was he willing.\n\nBefore, he didn't know the side effects and would randomly unleash his ultimate for a blind thrill.\n\nNow Zhou Ze truly didn't dare to continue stimulating that thing to constantly awaken like this.\n\nEven though several people had already died in this house,\n\nZhou Ze had no intention of sacrificing himself to avenge them.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nit was still because of selfishness?\n\nZhou Ze leaned against the balcony railing and sat down; his consciousness began to sink into a daze.\n\n............\n\n\"She... how could she... how could she...\"\n\nWhile Boss Zhou was leaning against the balcony, feeling drowsy,\n\nthe male host finally staggered to his feet.\n\nHe instinctively went to the bedroom first. He wanted to call his wife and son to run together; a monster had come to their home.\n\nHis mom had actually resurrected!\n\nHowever, when he pushed open the bedroom door,\n\nand saw the tragedy on the bed,\n\nhe frantically clutched his head, his mouth wide open. He couldn't believe everything that had happened before him.\n\nHis wife,\n\nhis son...\n\nboth...\n\nboth...\n\nThe male host dazedly walked back into the living room.\n\nHe felt this was a nightmare.\n\nA nightmare that made his heart pound and made him long to wake up immediately.\n\nSilently,\n\nhe glanced at Zhou Ze, who was sitting on the balcony.\n\nThen,\n\nhe picked up the axe that Cui Laotou had just thrown onto the ground.\n\nSwaying with each step as he walked towards the balcony.\n\n\"You... are all devils... all executioners... all... devils...\"\n\nThe male host, holding the axe,\n\nwalked towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes had been continuously squinted; his head ached terribly. Logically speaking, he should have been anesthetized and asleep, but he couldn't sleep. Anesthetics and sleeping pills were useless. However, it was precisely this feeling of being unable to fall asleep no matter what that was the most agonizing.\n\nZhou Ze didn't even know what was happening around him; he was just constantly struggling against the drug's effects within his body.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA muffled thud came.\n\nZhou Ze forced his eyes open.\n\nHe saw the male host collapse in front of him; an axe lay beside the male host. Behind the male host, he saw a blurry, familiar figure.\n\n...\n\nOh,\n\nit's you, Old Xu, you've arrived...\n\nOld Xu,\n\nMy head is so dizzy.\n\nThat Cui Laotou,\n\nindeed, with that zombie,\n\nthey are a team.\n\n...\n\n\"Scrape... scrape...\"\n\nFootsteps sounded.\n\n...\n\nOld Xu,\n\nHelp me up.\n\nLet's leave here first so we don't have trouble when dawn breaks. I still have hell money³ in my pocket; I can burn some.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze felt the other party's breath on his face,\n\nwarm and damp.\n\nHe knew it was Xu Qinglang squatting in front of him.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze felt a wet, sticky sensation on his face.\n\n...\n\nOld Xu,\n\nHurry up and help me up.\n\nUh,\n\nF*ck,\n\nAre you sick?\n\nWhy are you licking my face...?\n\n---\n¹**'Tear up the ticket' on your son**: A colloquial expression meaning to kill the hostage.\n²**_Chuanchuanxiang_**: A popular Chinese street food or restaurant type where various ingredients (meat, vegetables, etc.) are skewered and cooked in a hot pot.\n³**Hell money**: Also known as joss paper.

    "content": "Drowsy, aware of the outside world, but his head was very groggy. He felt like he should be able to fall into a deep sleep, yet he couldn't. This half-asleep, half-awake state was the most tormenting.\n\nZhou Ze recalled Tang Shi once telling him that when she wanted to sleep, she tried everything. Sleeping pills and anesthetics were child's play; but besides leaving her dazed and muddled and her body almost collapsing, they had no effect on her sleep whatsoever.\n\nA person who crawled out of hell was like a fish out of water; without the hellish environment, they were utterly unaccustomed.\n\nHis head was about to explode, like someone continuously cycling through nightmares, going back and forth between one dream after another. What exactly he dreamt of, he couldn't say, he'd forgotten it all, without even the slightest impression. The only thing he remembered was how awful and painful he felt.\n\nIt seemed the medicine was slowly wearing off.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes.\n\nFatigue,\n\nDeep fatigue,\n\nFollowed by aches and pains throughout his body.\n\n“Awake already.”\n\nXu Qinglang's voice came from beside him.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and saw Xu Qinglang, who had just wrung out a wet towel, wiping his face.\n\nThe wound on his chest had been bandaged; the problem should not be serious. Most importantly, God knew that Old Man Cui had actually poisoned it.\n\nXu Qinglang also had several bandaged wounds on his body, especially around his neck, which was thickly wrapped.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit confused and asked:\n\n“What happened to you?”\n\n“The walking corpse you killed last night suddenly jumped back up after you left. Fortunately, I still managed to deal with it.”\n\n“Are you alright?”\n\n“I'm fine.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded, sat up from the bed, and only then realized that they were still in Old Man Cui's mud house.\n\n“Old Man Cui and that murderous zombie are in cahoots,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“Mm.” Xu Qinglang didn't seem too surprised. In fact, once Old Man Cui used the appearance of the walking corpse to shed his cicada shell to escape*, the idea had become very clear.\n\n“How are you doing?”\n\n“A bit of a headache.”\n\nSaying this, Zhou Ze got out of bed, gently patted his forehead with his palm. His head still felt uncomfortable.\n\n“Wuwuwu…”\n\nA whimpering sound came; it was the male homeowner.\n\n“He…” Zhou Ze pointed at the male homeowner and asked.\n\n“Oh, when you were sitting on the veranda, this kid tried to hack you with an axe. I knocked him out, then I conveniently tied him up too. I burned some hell money, so we shouldn't have any trouble for now. After all, we didn't kill those people. I also didn't deal with the bodies in that house; no need to draw a snake and add feet**. Besides, they wouldn't be easy to handle anyway.”\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze stood up and walked over to the male homeowner.\n\nHonestly, this male homeowner was very pitiable; he possessed every factor that warranted sympathy.\n\nFirstly,\n\nHe had a mother who loved him even in death,\n\nTurning into a zombie after death, she still came to talk to him,\n\nHis wife and son had just died too,\n\nHis two friends also died,\n\nAnd the \"San'er\" he mentioned was likely last night's walking corpse,\n\nAnd also,\n\nHe lost a large sum of money last night.\n\nBut for some reason, Zhou Ze just couldn't bring himself to pity him.\n\nHe reached out and removed the dirty rag from the other party's mouth.\n\nAs soon as his mouth was free, the other party wanted to shout “Help me!”\n\nBut Zhou Ze slapped him down.\n\n“Slap!”\n\n“Help…”\n\n“Slap!”\n\n“Help…”\n\n“Slap!”\n\n“……”\n\n“Slap!”\n\nWith the last slap, the other party was clearly well-behaved and dared not shout, but Zhou Ze's slap still landed.\n\nThe other party suddenly felt very wronged.\n\nI yelled, so you hit me, naturally.\n\nBut I stopped yelling and admitted defeat, so why are you still hitting me?\n\nZhou Ze paused, then said apologetically:\n\n“My bad, just woke up. Got a bit of morning crankiness, just felt like slapping someone to vent.”\n\n“……” The male homeowner.\n\nHe found a small stool and sat down.\n\nXu Qinglang brought in a plate of vegetable fried rice from outside.\n\n“Old Man Cui is so lazy he doesn't even keep chickens or ducks at home. Can't make anything better, so just make do.”\n\nZhou Ze took the bowl and chopsticks, a bit awkwardly saying:\n\n“I didn't bring my Underworld Flower Oral Solution.”\n\nBecause Boss Zhou hadn't expected things here to become so serious, nor that they would be delayed for so long, he hadn't brought his provisions***.\n\nXu Qinglang sighed, as if he had long anticipated this, and reached into his pocket,\n\nPulled out a bottle of plum juice,\n\nAnd placed it on the table.\n\nZhou Ze paused, then smiled,\n\n“Haven't had this stuff in a few days, I was actually missing it.”\n\nWith a gulp of plum juice, fueled by its tartness, Zhou Ze began to wolf down his rice, like a prisoner just released from jail.\n\nFor some inexplicable reason,\n\nZhou Ze felt that wolfing down food like this was somehow more satisfying. Indeed, once certain habits are formed, it's very difficult to revert, no matter if others consider them good or bad.\n\nAfter eating,\n\nZhou Ze tapped the male homeowner's head with his chopsticks. This guy was tied up here, Old Xu hadn't given him anything to eat or drink, yet his mental will was incredibly strong. He could still maintain such a tenacious state of life after encountering such upheavals, which was indeed admirable.\n\n“What's your name?”\n\n“Sun Kewang.”\n\n“When did your mother die?”\n\n“Four years ago.”\n\nThis man named Sun Kewang, at this moment, displayed an unusual cooperativeness. Last night's events had likely flattened out all his rebelliousness****. The him who picked up the axe wanting to chop Zhou Ze was probably his last display of courage, but it was ruined by Xu Qinglang, who arrived in time. Some things can be done once, but not again*****.\n\n“Four years ago.”\n\nZhou Ze savored this answer.\n\nHe believed this should be a blood vengeance. When an ancestor turned into a zombie and emerged from underground, their first reaction was to find and kill their direct relatives. That old woman was no different.\n\n“Where was your mother buried?”\n\n“At the ancestral graves by the village entrance.”\n\n“Earth burial?”\n\n“Yes, earth burial.”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. If it had been cremation, there wouldn't have been so much trouble.\n\n“Envious?” Xu Qinglang, drinking water nearby, didn't forget to add a barb.\n\n“What am I envious of?”\n\n“Envious that others get earth burials, but when you return, you can only hold your own ashes, unable to admire your glorious beauty from your past life.”\n\n“Heh heh.”\n\n“Oh, I forgot, you don't even have ashes left.”\n\n“……” Zhou Ze.\n\n“Alright, you keep asking. I won't interrupt anymore.”\n\n“No worries, let's chat a bit more. Old Xu, do you think I'll die first, or you?”\n\n“You're a ghost messenger, so I'll definitely die first,” Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n“Then who'll arrange your funeral?”\n\n“……” Old Xu.\n\n“Do you prefer ashes in soup with rice, or ashes with curry chicken leg rice?”\n\n“……” Old Xu.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had indeed seen such claims in pulp fiction******, stating that the country promoted cremation to prevent the appearance of zombies. This was largely nonsense, but conversely, it made a lot of sense: the promotion of cremation did indeed reduce the probability of zombies appearing. If a corpse turns to ash, no matter how big a problem you have, you couldn't possibly sprinkle some water and cement to reconstruct your body, could you?\n\n“Your mother was buried four years ago, that's not too long ago. When the village relocated graves earlier, did you not see your mother's ashes?” Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n“Didn't see them.”\n\n“How could you not have seen them? It's one thing if old graves can't be found, but yours is…” Xu Qinglang suddenly thought of something. “You didn't use a coffin when you buried her?”\n\nSun Kewang shook his head.\n\n“You're truly filial,” Xu Qinglang scoffed.\n\nIn this era, earth burials were illegal in most regions. Some 'iron-headed' individuals******* who insisted on earth burials still aimed for a dignified send-off. But Sun Kewang's approach of burying his mother without even preparing a coffin was truly baffling.\n\n“Right, the most important question hasn't been asked: How did your mother die?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThis was the crux of the matter.\n\nIt was certain that his mother had an affair******** with Old Man Cui; this tunnel was the best proof.\n\nIf Old Man Cui hadn't appeared earlier, Zhou Ze would have solved the problem long ago.\n\nSun Kewang hesitated for a moment, then finally replied with difficulty:\n\n“Died of illness.”\n\n“Slap!”\n\nZhou Ze slapped him across the face.\n\nA very crisp slap,\n\nA very impatient slap,\n\nThis was enough to show that Boss Zhou's morning crankiness hadn't fully vented.\n\n“The feeling of slapping just now was too good, I hadn't had my fill. Thank you for giving me this chance again.”\n\nSaying this, Zhou Ze leaned his face close to Sun Kewang's, then pointed at Xu Qinglang beside him:\n\n“Do you think he's so good-looking that he's easy to trick?”\n\n“……” Xu Qinglang.\n\nSun Kewang shook his head.\n\n“Slap!”\n\nAnother slap.\n\n“Can't speak anymore?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\nSun Kewang's face was almost swollen from Zhou Ze's slaps.\n\nWithin these 24 hours, he had already suffered the most inhumane blows, yet at this moment, he still had to face Zhou Ze's almost mocking torment. He had actually collapsed long ago.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Good, tell me again, how did your mother die?”\n\n“Illness…”\n\n“Slap!”\n\nA slap.\n\n“Keep answering.”\n\n“She was… she was… my fault… I caused it all…”\n\n“Slap!”\n\n“Please no emotional embellishment or build-up. Get straight to the point.”\n\n“I killed her.”\n\nZhou Ze straightened up and stretched.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was sharp-eyed********* and had long seen through everything; rather, this guy's acting was terrible. When he first answered about his mother's death, he stammered and hesitated. Even those 'little fresh meat' actors********** who are often criticized online for their acting are better than him.\n\n“Why did you kill your mother?”\n\n“She was pregnant.”\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang exchanged glances.\n\nThat old woman, she must be in her sixties or seventies, right?\n\n“She can still get pregnant at that age?”\n\nXu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze. After all, Zhou Ze was a doctor in his previous life and knew more.\n\n“There are cases of women in their sixties getting pregnant and giving birth in China, and in their seventies abroad,” Zhou Ze replied, “but it's very dangerous.”\n\nSun Kewang seemed to have entered a state. His current mental and emotional state was somewhat fanatical. Without waiting for Zhou Ze to continue asking, he gritted his teeth and continued:\n\n“At such an old age, she was still messing around with a man, getting pregnant, and even told me she wanted to live with that paramour! She begged me, saying it was fine even if they didn't get legally married or have a ceremony, as long as they could just live together!\n\nHer belly was already big,\n\nWhere would I, her son, put my face?***********\n\nI told her to abort the child,\n\nBut she refused.\n\nHahahaha,\n\nSo I, along with a few friends,\n\nHer…\n\nHer…\n\nHer with a quilt,\n\nSmothered her to death!”\n\n---\n*   **shed its cicada shell to escape**: An idiom (金蝉脱壳, *jīn chán tuō ké*) meaning to escape by elaborate disguise or by leaving a fake behind.

    "content": "Almost hysterical, Sun Kewang was gagged again with a rag by Xu Qinglang. Then, Xu Qinglang lit a cigarette and walked to the doorway, where Zhou Ze was already puffing away.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine, that he would kill his own mother just for something like this.\n\nThe first walking corpse that appeared, nicknamed San'er in the village, was very helpful. He actually helped with that matter too; he helped this Sun fellow kill his mother. He really was the village's good Samaritan.\"\n\n\"What's so hard to imagine?\" Zhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash. \"Isn't this quite normal? Do you think only wealthy and aristocratic families care about their reputation?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Ancient imperial families could do anything to cover up their scandals; murder and silencing were mere child's play. While not excusable, at least we can still understand it.\n\nBut in reality, the humbler the household, the more it cares about its 'face,' even if outsiders don't see it as having any. The more backward a place, the more it cares about such rules.\n\nIn our country, even now, there are still many places where women cannot eat at the table, especially when guests arrive. It's often considered a matter of great pride for a family if their women are obedient and sensible.\n\nHis mother being pregnant, for Sun Kewang, was no less than his 'royal bloodline' being defiled. It might not seem like much to an outsider like you, but from his perspective, it could make him the village's laughingstock, affecting his prestige and dignity in the village.\n\nBecause for his entire life, the village is all he has; his sky is only as big as the sky above this village.\"\n\n\"You can understand that?\"\n\n\"I don't understand, but I can get used to it. Don't forget how Yingying died—didn't she just go on a date with an impoverished scholar? After her family found out, she was drowned in a pig cage.*\n\nWasn't that for family honor, for 'face'? Tell me, is there any essential difference between these two incidents?\"\n\n\"Let's not talk about that for now. There's one thing I've always found strange.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"How did Old Man Cui hit you with that crossbow bolt last night? I remember you had a set of armor on, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze paused at the question, his expression becoming a little strange.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang pressed.\n\n\"I need to figure out how to catch that zombie tonight, and that corpse-fetus. If that old woman eats it, the problem will become even more troublesome than before.\"\n\n\"Hey, don't change the subject.\" Xu Qinglang wouldn't let it go.\n\n\"You're so annoying.\"\n\n\"Answer my question. As a dignified ghost messenger**, to be knocked down by an ordinary person with an amusement park crossbow bolt, aren't you ashamed?\"\n\n\"How was I supposed to know he'd pull out a crossbow after throwing an axe?\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then...\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and touched his forehead.\n\n\"It seems I've been in the sun too much lately, and I've been a salted fish*** for too long. I actually forgot I had armor on.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Alright, don't dwell on this anymore. If you keep dwelling on it, I'll only feel more and more how foolish**** I was last night.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked up to Zhou Ze, his hands suddenly gripping Zhou Ze's neck, and he said fiercely:\n\n\"So, if you hadn't been hit by that crossbow bolt yesterday, they wouldn't have been able to escape, and we could have finished things today!\n\nThe reason we're still stuck here, with the zombie and Old Man Cui still uncaptured, and still dawdling and scratching our heads, is entirely because you yourself forgot your own abilities?\"\n\n\"Let go, Old Xu, let go.\"\n\nZhou Ze initially thought Xu Qinglang was just joking, but he didn't expect the other party's grip to grow tighter and tighter, choking him almost to the point of being unable to breathe.\n\nIn that instant,\n\nA black ripple began to emanate from Zhou Ze. A set of mysterious, majestic black warrior armor appeared, protecting his neck.\n\nZhou Ze felt his neck loosen; Xu Qinglang's strength was suddenly largely absorbed by the armor.\n\nXu Qinglang finally let go of his hands, found a stool and sat down, covering his face with his hands. He apologized:\n\n\"I'm sorry, I got agitated. When I think of that family that died last night, I feel a bit sick inside.\n\nSun Kewang deserves to die, but he didn't. Yet, the ones who shouldn't have died were his wife and son.\n\nIf we don't deal with that zombie tonight, more people in the village might die. I don't think Old Man Cui can control that zombie, even if she was his mistress in life.\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath, his armor slowly receding.\n\n\"Don't worry, there won't be any more problems tonight. I'm going to lie down on the bed for a while. Call me when it's dark. Also, Old Xu, have you been secretly going to the gym lately? Your grip has gotten stronger.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze turned and walked towards the bedroom.\n\nXu Qinglang sat alone on the stool.\n\nHe uncovered his face.\n\nLooking at his palms with some horror,\n\nJust then,\n\nThat violent murderous intent felt uncontrollable, an instinctive urge rising from within, a desire to thoroughly brutalize any life he could kill before his eyes.\n\nThen,\n\nXu Qinglang stuck out his tongue,\n\nAnd licked his palm.\n\nHis scent still lingered on his palm.\n\nSo delicious!\n\n………………\n\nNight fell.\n\nPerhaps due to the burning of joss paper, the news of the deaths at Sun Kewang's house hadn't spread yet. Coupled with the scattered residences in the village, and Sun Kewang usually only associating with unsavory friends, no one in the village thought to check on him when he didn't appear all day.\n\nThus, the village remained mostly peaceful that night.\n\nSun Kewang was tied to a Chinese scholar tree by Zhou Ze, his mouth still gagged.\n\nZhou Ze himself stood beneath, leaning against the tree. He was waiting, waiting for that old woman from last night to reappear.\n\nHaving transformed into a zombie, with her past hatred combined with the impulse for blood vengeance, the old woman had an unquenchable obsession with killing her son.\n\nShe would come.\n\nShe definitely would.\n\nZhou Ze had pricked a few cuts on Sun Kewang's body with his fingernails. Blood dripped down continuously; it wouldn't kill him, but it was like drawing a little blood to attract sharks.\n\nXu Qinglang stood by the side, his face appearing somber in the night.\n\nIn the latter half of the night,\n\nThe wind slowly picked up.\n\nFrom the distant vegetable field, a hunched figure approached. Old Man Cui walked alone, coming to within ten meters of Zhou Ze.\n\nThis time, he didn't bring an axe, nor did he have a crossbow on his back.\n\nThis made Boss Zhou a little disappointed. He had so hoped Old Man Cui would shoot him a few more times, and then his armor would appear and perfectly block the attacks, allowing him to reclaim his dignity from yesterday.\n\nBut Old Man Cui's posture today was practically holding a white flag.\n\n\"Let's talk.\"\n\nOld Man Cui looked at Zhou Ze and said calmly.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be much to talk about.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Is that old woman trapped by you? But how long can you hold her? She won't be able to hold back. Believe me, in this world, there aren't many people who understand zombies better than I do.\"\n\n\"Let her kill him.\"\n\nOld Man Cui pointed at Sun Kewang hanging on the tree and continued:\n\n\"He deserves to die.\"\n\nZhou Ze said nothing, waiting for Old Man Cui to continue.\n\n\"Let her fulfill her last wish, and then our family will deal with ourselves. I've prepared the pyre, and the gasoline is ready. I'm just waiting for this day.\"\n\n\"That corpse-fetus is indeed your daughter.\"\n\n\"I hate having these yin-yang eyes! I wish I could have remained oblivious!\" Old Man Cui roared, his face contorted in a ferocious expression. \"But I can see! I saw her, I saw our daughter crying alone at her grave, I saw her weeping down there.\n\nI so wish she had died of illness, I so wish she had died of illness!\"\n\nPeople often say the human world seems beautiful, but at least, it still has a \"seems.\" Zhou Ze actually felt that ghosts are nothing more than the most fundamental aspect of human nature revealed after tearing away society's hypocritical disguises.\n\nHe could understand Old Man Cui's feelings; he could even empathize.\n\n\"You could call the police.\"\n\n\"Call the police? Tell the police I can see ghosts? Tell the police his dead mother told me he killed her?\"\n\nOld Man Cui scoffed in response.\n\n\"You should move aside.\"\n\nOld Man Cui said to Zhou Ze.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nBehind Old Man Cui, a figure crawling on the ground appeared. Beside that figure, the little girl stood there in a daze; she was the most bewildered and ignorant of them all.\n\nThe old woman's chest wound was still clearly visible, making her movements very slow today, but the hatred in her eyes was still so intense, especially when she saw her son hanging on the tree.\n\nYour enemy is ready to surrender. They plan to end their own lives after fulfilling their last wish.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze found it so boring. His punch, ready to be thrown, and his mental preparation to wipe away yesterday's disgrace, all became useless effort.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's my duty. I can't just watch you kill someone.\"\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward.\n\n\"Do you have to be so pedantic?\"\n\nOld Man Cui, watching Zhou Ze steadily approach, gritted his teeth and said, \"I can still control her right now. If I die first or she escapes, do you not understand what kind of trouble that will be?\"\n\n\"It's my duty too, I'm sorry.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nZhou Ze raised his fist and punched Old Man Cui.\n\nOld Man Cui took Zhou Ze's punch, staggering back two steps, but subconsciously also kicked Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze didn't dodge, and the kick landed directly on his calf.\n\n\"Ow...\"\n\nZhou Ze fell to the ground in response, clutching his chest, looking like he was in great pain and gravely injured.\n\n\"...\" Old Man Cui.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang walked over at this point, looked at Zhou Ze on the ground, and quietly reminded him, \"He kicked your leg, you're clutching your chest.\"\n\nZhou Ze glared at Xu Qinglang and dramatically explained:\n\n\"This old man has such profound internal energy!\"\n\n---\n* **Drowned in a pig cage (浸豬籠 - jìn zhū lóng):** A brutal traditional punishment in some parts of China, where a person accused of certain moral transgressions (often adultery) was placed in a pig cage and thrown into a body of water to drown.\n** **Ghost messenger (鬼差 - guǐ chāi):** In Chinese folklore, a celestial or underworld official responsible for guiding or capturing the souls of the dead.\n*** **Salted fish (鹹魚 - xiányú):** A colloquial term or idiom in Chinese, often referring to someone who is lazy, unmotivated, or has given up on aspirations.
