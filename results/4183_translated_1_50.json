    "content": "Scooping up a handful of water, he splashed it on his face. Zhou Ze slowly raised his head, looking at himself in the mirror. He looked a bit haggard. As an ER doctor, this kind of haggardness was almost standard issue.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is on their way! Looks like they fell from upstairs, not sure if it was a suicide attempt!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the entrance of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there,\" Zhou Ze replied, pulling out a paper towel to dry the water from his face as he started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance soon pulled into the hospital. On the gurney lay an old man in a gray Tang suit. The old man was coughing nonstop, occasionally spitting up bloody foam and fragments of his spleen. His entire body was covered in blood.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the gurney while observing the patient's condition, simultaneously yelling to the people ahead, \"Prep the surgical instruments, now!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I… I… don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, fixed on Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you're going to be okay. We'll help you. You're not going to die.\"\n\nMost terminal patients said things like this at such a time. People who could truly face death with calm were, after all, a minority. And as a doctor, this was certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell him his odds of survival. What the patient needed at this moment was psychological comfort.\n\n\"No… no… down there… down there… it's really terrifying down there…\"\n\nThe old man suddenly seized Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a dead-serious expression.\n\n\"You need to calm down, relax. Your life is not in danger.\" Although his wrist was beginning to ache, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull away.\n\n\"I don't want… don't want to go down again… They… they found me… I… they found me…\"\n\n\"Hiss…\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" a young nurse beside him cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, they were black—a translucent black, like amber, not the kind that came from an accumulation of dirt.\n\nAnd right now, the old man's nails were digging into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down… not going down… not going down… haha… cough cough cough…\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat bolt upright and began coughing violently. Then, his body shuddered. The hand gripping Zhou Ze's wrist fell away, and he went completely still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitation measures while the defibrillator was readied.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me take care of your wound,\" Wang Ya said, walking over.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about a small flesh wound. Their biggest fear was the patient having some other disease, which could put the doctor at risk of occupational exposure. After all, the old man's hands had just been covered in blood, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, once contracted, could ruin your entire life.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the ER and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nIt meant the man didn't make it.\n\nEveryone's spirits sank a little, but for them, this sort of thing was commonplace. They would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, you should get a check-up,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the locker room to change his clothes, then headed to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and drove away.\n\nJust as he drove under the Jianghai Avenue Overpass, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now. Please have the kids wait just a little longer for me.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright.\" The person on the other end quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green. Zhou Ze stepped on the gas and drove through.\n\n\"BEEEEEEEEEEP!!!!!!\"\n\nAt that very moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and came right at him. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and see the blinding high beams through the car window.\n\nThen,\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nThe world spun.\n\nBefore the heavy truck, the small car was like a flimsy piece of paper, sent flying. It tumbled several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh…\"\n\nZhou Ze regained consciousness.\n\nHe found he couldn't move his body at all, as if he were pinned.\n\nAt the same time, he couldn't open his eyes. He knew he'd been in a car crash, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he wanted to check his injuries, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he could hear the sound of other cars driving by and various horns honking.\n\n*Am I still at the scene of the accident?*\n\n*Am I still in the car?*\n\nZhou Ze wondered to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe wail of police sirens arrived, followed by the sound of a fire truck.\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance reached him.\n\nZhou Ze could feel his body being moved. The temperature nearby was a bit high; they must be cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations; he was familiar with the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity. The cake in his trunk, and the June 1st Children's Day party for the orphanage kids, would have to be called off.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh in his mind. At least he had survived. This counted as a stroke of bad luck, he supposed.\n\nHe could hear the voices of several nurses nearby, but it was too noisy, so he couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut what Dr. Chen said next made Zhou Ze's heart sink to the bottom of a pit!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has no vital signs.\"\n\n*No.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm still alive!*\n\n*I'm not dead!!*\n\nZhou Ze screamed frantically in his mind!\n\nHe wasn't dead. He was still conscious. He wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt it, those heavy compressions, one after another, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nHe hoped they would realize quickly that he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the sounds of several nurses he knew crying.\n\nDr. Chen slammed his fist on a nearby car door, looking grief-stricken.\n\n*Hey!*\n\n*Don't give up!*\n\n*Please don't give up!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I must be in a state of suspended animation.*\n\n*Massive blood loss?*\n\n*Severe injuries?*\n\n*But I'm really not dead!*\n\n*I should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!*\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his mind.\n\nBut then, he felt himself being lifted onto a gurney and, presumably, moved into an ambulance.\n\nThen came the sound of the ambulance driving off.\n\nThe nurses in the vehicle were still crying.\n\nBut their cries were exceptionally grating to Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nHe wasn't dead yet.\n\nWhat was there to cry about!\n\nWhy were they crying!\n\n*Look at me again.*\n\n*Look at me again.*\n\n*Check me one more time.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nNext, Zhou Ze heard the voice of a hospital director:\n\n\"Little Zhou is just… gone?\"\n\n\"The crash was very severe. Dr. Zhou's injuries were too extensive, he lost too much blood. Death has been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone like that?\" Another vice-director couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked him again myself.\"\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bunch of quacks!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bastards!*\n\n*Bastards!*\n\nZhou Ze cursed them endlessly in his mind. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, no longer his friends, and certainly not his superiors and elders.\n\nThey had actually declared him dead.\n\nBut could a dead person still hear and feel things?\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*You bunch of bastards.*\n\n*Animals.*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\n*Save me!*\n\nThe gurney began to move. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Little Ya, don't be so sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it. A person, just gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"The heavens have unpredictable storms, and people have sudden fortunes and misfortunes. You just have to try and accept it.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the two nurses left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty.\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nwas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, kept trying to fight back. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make a sound.\n\nBut his current state was like a ghost holding him down; no matter how hard he tried, his body was completely beyond his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nhe gave up, somewhat in despair.\n\nHe was tired.\n\nAnd weary.\n\nHe knew where he was now.\n\nIn the hospital's\n\nmorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, it was to the sensation of a faint coolness on his face. The stinging pain was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done yet?\" someone asked from the side.\n\n\"Don't rush me. Hold on, he was all mangled in the crash. Doing makeup isn't that fast.\"\n\n\"The hospital people are pushing. They need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it, then?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed and applied the makeup with more force. Of course, her clients were the dead. The dead certainly wouldn't complain about pain, nor did she have to worry about receiving complaints. She just had to make sure the living saw the results.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nenduring the stinging pain of the makeup brush pressing down on his face again and again.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt his clothes being changed. Then, he was pushed out. Hospital orderlies lifted him and placed him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nmust be the refrigerated casket.\n\nThen, all the noise from the outside world was instantly cut off.\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nswaying,\n\nbumping…\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The casket lid must have been opened.\n\nWhat reached his ears\n\nwas funeral music.\n\nThe director was at a microphone giving a speech, praising him, lamenting his loss.\n\nThen came the vice-director, the department head, and others.\n\nAround him,\n\nhe could hear the sound of footsteps passing by from time to time.\n\nSome people just walked past quietly, taking one last look at him.\n\nSome even tried to call his name a few times, their voices choked with tears.\n\nThis was the viewing of the remains.\n\nThe viewing.\n\nOf *my* remains!\n\n*I'm not dead.*\n\n*I'm really not dead.*\n\n*I'm still alive!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his mind.\n\nHe started trying to struggle again,\n\nbut it was still no use.\n\nHe could only hear, and he could feel,\n\nbut he couldn't speak,\n\nand he couldn't open his eyes.\n\nEveryone was convinced he was dead.\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nhe was not dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage came too, crying beside him.\n\nTheir tears were sincere, because Zhou Ze himself had grown up in that orphanage. Because of that, after he started working, he donated most of his salary to it. This car crash happened because he had been rushing back to the orphanage at night to celebrate June 1st Children's Day with the kids.\n\n\"Little Zhou, you can go in peace. This time, it can be considered a work-related incident. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation money to the orphanage. You can rest assured,\" the vice-director said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nAfterward,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being sealed off again. The casket lid must have been closed once more.\n\nThen another series of bumps.\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe casket lid was opened again.\n\nIt was somewhat quiet around him. He could hear occasional voices, but it wasn't noisy.\n\nTwo people, one grabbing his shoulders and the other his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, which felt like a steel plate.\n\nThese two were practiced, very, very practiced.\n\nIn the background, there were faint, indistinct sounds of crying.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't figure out where he had been taken now.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nhe suddenly understood.\n\n*Those bastards!*\n\n*They'd brought him to the crematorium!*\n\n*They were going to burn him!*\n\n*I'm not dead, you bastards!*\n\n*Fuck your ancestors!*\n\n*I'm not dead!*\n\n*I'm not dead yet!*\n\n*Don't cremate me.*\n\n*Don't cremate me!*\n\n*I'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!*\n\n*You animals.*\n\n*You mutts!*\n\n*Sons of bitches!!!!!*\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was more frantic than ever, more insane than ever.\n\nHe knew,\n\nonce he was cremated,\n\nthere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would be facing death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling. He was truly unwilling. He wasn't even thirty yet, he hadn't started a family, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long road ahead of him!\n\n\"Mama, I just saw that uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice piped up nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small hand slapped her across the mouth.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. Just wait till I deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nBecause no matter how he struggled,\n\nno matter how he roared in his mind,\n\nthe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started up.\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nand because of that, he was filled with incomparable terror!\n\n*No.*\n\n*No.*\n\n*No!*\n\n*I'm not dead, I'm really not dead!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\n*Don't burn me!*\n\nNo one could hear his cries.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad.\n\nOnly responsible for grieving.\n\nOnly responsible for seeing this process through.\n\nAnd then go home, eat dinner, and carry on with their lives tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being pushed into a narrow space that reeked of oily residue.\n\nNext,\n\na sticky liquid sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what this was.\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nThen,\n\n\"Ssssss…\"\n\nHot!\n\nSo hot!\n\nPain.\n\nExcruciating, burning pain!\n\nFire.\n\nFire.\n\nA great fire.\n\nFire was everywhere…",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

    "content": "午夜的街頭，\n\n\n\n  路燈黃黃，\n\n\n\n  人也惶惶，\n\n\n\n  天很冷，還有風，似刀子割人。\n\n\n\n  周澤也感到冷，\n\n\n\n  他不知道這裡又是哪裡，\n\n\n\n  但知道一件事，\n\n\n\n  這裡是……人間。\n\n\n\n  他已經死了，但又回來了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道自己該怎麼辦，\n\n\n\n  只能機械麻木地繼續往前走。\n\n\n\n  他現在沒有功夫去思考太多其他的事情，\n\n\n\n  比如自己剛剛下去的地方，\n\n\n\n  比如那個自己車禍前救治的老者，\n\n\n\n  比如水潭裡身穿著紅色衣裙的無面女，\n\n\n\n  比如……自己的指甲。\n\n\n\n  他回來了，本該是很喜悅的一件事，但哪怕身邊偶爾有人走過，哪怕他再用力地打招呼，也依舊沒人可以看見他和聽見他。\n\n\n\n  他被這個世界給排擠了，隔絕了。\n\n\n\n  沒嘗試過被關「禁閉」的人，不會了解那種被完全隔離的痛苦，而對於周澤來說，眼下整個世界，就是他的囚籠，囚籠上還蓋上了一層黑布。 \n\n\n\n  沒人能看見他，\n\n\n\n  也沒人能和他交流，\n\n\n\n  他拿不起任何一件有實的東西，\n\n\n\n  甚至，\n\n\n\n  連風都能夠從他身上輕而易舉地吹過去。\n\n\n\n  他是那麼的羸弱，\n\n\n\n  弱不禁風這個詞在他身上，真的是一點都不誇張。\n\n\n\n  而且，最讓周澤震驚和駭然的是，\n\n\n\n  他能看見自己身上不斷有淡淡的光點流散出去，\n\n\n\n  換言之，\n\n\n\n  他的身體正在慢慢地變淡。\n\n\n\n  可能再過個一刻鐘，自己就將徹底地消失不見，被抹去最後一絲微不足道的痕跡。\n\n\n\n  他不知道這一切到底是怎麼發生的，但他清楚，自己的時間，真的沒剩下多少了。\n\n\n\n  八仙里，鐵拐李就是以魂魄的方式進入了一位餓死倒地的人體內，才成了後世流傳那種形象。\n\n\n\n  周澤也聽說過關於鬼魂「借屍還魂」的故事，他也想去借屍還魂，他很冷，也很慌張，他需要一具肉體給自己去依附。\n\n\n\n  甚至，他不介意這個人是誰。\n\n\n\n  人在這個時候，總是自私的，周澤也不例外，而且，他是真的快受不了了。 \n\n\n\n  但是，每當他準備靠近一個人時，那個人的頭頂和雙肩位置都會出現光火，直接讓其無法靠近，甚至自己還因此受到了傷害，加劇了自己「揮發」的速度。\n\n\n\n  他有些累了，也有些麻木了，\n\n\n\n  他在等待自己的終結，\n\n\n\n  等待自己的結束。\n\n\n\n  作為一名已經死過一次的人，你讓他再面臨一次死亡，反而能夠變得更坦然了一些。\n\n\n\n  而且，以周澤現在的情況，繼續逗留在這裡，逗留得時間越久，也就是意味著他承受折磨的時間越長。\n\n\n\n  「吱呀……」\n\n\n\n  前面，有一家還亮著燈的店面，好像是一家書店，因為隔著店門玻璃可以看見裡面的一排排書架。\n\n\n\n  有人從裡面將門推開走了出來，是一名穿著衛衣的男子，男子戴著帽子，看不清楚真容，左顧右盼了一會兒，急匆匆離開了。\n\n\n\n  當然，男子是看不見距離他不到五米處所站著的周澤的。\n\n\n\n  原本，周澤沒覺得有什麼異常，但就在男子離開不久之後，周澤忽然自書店裡，感知到了一種溫暖的氣息。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  溫暖的氣息。\n\n\n\n  這種溫暖，讓周澤有些莫名其妙，但他眼下就像是一個即將凍死的人忽然得到一盒火柴一樣，哪怕知道火柴救不了自己的命但還是會劃開它讓自己在臨死前感知到最後的溫熱。 \n\n\n\n  周澤向那邊走過去，他的身體直接穿過了書店的玻璃門，繼續往裡走，來到了書店的書架後面。\n\n\n\n  書架後面，\n\n\n\n  躺著一個人，\n\n\n\n  是一個面容俊秀的年輕男子，年紀可能也就二十三四歲的樣子，因為店裡開著空調，所以他身上穿的衣服不多，也就一件長袖外加一件薄外套。\n\n\n\n  他躺在地上，但在他身上，周澤感知到了一種溫暖的感覺，就像是一個窮鬼，晚上走在路上撿了一袋子金幣。\n\n\n\n  這種吸引力，無法拒絕，而且現在的周澤，也沒資格去拒絕！\n\n\n\n  周澤走了過去，在這個年輕男子面前蹲了下來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道該如何去進入對方的身體，但他明白該如何去接觸自己所需要的溫暖。\n\n\n\n  一隻手伸出，放在對方的胸口位置，\n\n\n\n  周澤看見自己的指甲居然慢慢地嵌入到了對方的體內，\n\n\n\n  這是一種很詭異的感覺，不同於自己之前走在路上時「微風」吹過自己的身體，這是一種相融，以自己的指甲為媒介進行的一種融合。\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，周澤整個人開始進入到對方的體內，二者，開始了重合。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  「徐樂！你給我醒醒，醒醒！」 \n\n\n\n  周澤被一番推搡給吵醒，不，確切的說，是被「驚動」，他睜開眼，發現自己正坐在書店櫃檯後面，之前自己是雙手枕在上面。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你醒醒！」\n\n\n\n  女人的聲音很尖銳，很高亢，帶著一種頤氣指使。\n\n\n\n  抬起頭，周澤看著面前的女人，不，確切地說，應該是女孩兒，也就是高中生的年紀吧，雖然是大女孩兒了，卻還是有點稚氣未脫。\n\n\n\n  「喂，徐樂，你到底是什麼意思，你能耐了是吧，想給我爸媽給我姐臉色看了是吧，昨晚居然敢一宿沒回家！\n\n\n\n  誰給你的這個膽子！」\n\n\n\n  徐樂？\n\n\n\n  是誰？\n\n\n\n  周澤有些茫然地攤開手，發現自己雙手很平滑，自己以前的手可是因為長時間練習手術器械已經有了一些老繭，這雙手卻沒有。\n\n\n\n  「喂，我在和你說話呢！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒一巴掌拍在櫃檯上，氣勢洶洶。\n\n\n\n  周澤微微皺眉，站起身，走到了店門邊的玻璃鏡子前，他看見了自己的倒影，是一張陌生的臉，不，這張臉自己見過，是昨晚自己看見的那張臉。\n\n\n\n  這身體，\n\n\n\n  是我的了？\n\n\n\n  「喂，你什麼意思啊，我爸媽可都生氣了，我媽還在家裡發脾氣了呢，我告訴你啊，你現在吃的喝的用的都是我家的，你這個上門女婿有什麼資格在我家裡擺譜？ \n\n\n\n  你想做樣子給誰看啊！\n\n\n\n  你今晚再敢不回家，信不信我過來直接抽你！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒作勢揚起自己的巴掌，但她忽然發現自己面前的男子也就是自己的「姐夫」沒有像是往常一樣躲閃和求饒，反而那一雙眸子裡的意味，讓她感到有些害怕。\n\n\n\n  這時候，她看了看時間，發現已經七點半了。\n\n\n\n  「哼，我先上學去了，晚上再和你算帳！」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒氣呼呼地走了。\n\n\n\n  周澤則是緩緩地坐回到了自己櫃檯後面的椅子上，這裡有一台老式筆記本，筆記本旁邊還有一部手機。\n\n\n\n  即使是現在，他依舊沒能從自己身份轉換的過程中適應過來。\n\n\n\n  他是周澤，是通城有名的年輕外科醫生，而且，他是一個孤兒，\n\n\n\n  結果，\n\n\n\n  自己眼下變成這個身份，\n\n\n\n  剛剛那個女孩兒說什麼來著？\n\n\n\n  我是……上門女婿？\n\n\n\n  有一個妻子？\n\n\n\n  還有丈母娘和丈人？\n\n\n\n  而且看自己這個小姨子剛剛自己這個「姐夫」面前說話的態度和語氣，自己這個「上門女婿」還真是符合古代的優良傳統。 \n\n\n\n  上門女婿，俗稱倒插門的，不光被妻子家裡人看不起，在古代也會被周遭所有人看不起，甚至身份和罪犯差不多，漢唐的時候那些被強迫戍邊的人裡面往往也有贅婿。\n\n\n\n  拿起手機，手機沒設置密碼，也不知道是那貨懶還是不敢設密碼，至少在這個時候讓周澤很輕鬆地打開了他的微信和QQ。\n\n\n\n  QQ列表里人很少，也就是些許初中同學，高中同學和大學同學，然後有一個家人的列表，裡面只有一個人，備註是「老婆」。\n\n\n\n  打開了和她的QQ聊天記錄，空。\n\n\n\n  好吧，\n\n\n\n  周澤打開了微信，試著找了一下，找到了備註是「老婆」的女人，這裡有回覆了，基本都是徐樂問一些事情，比如今晚吃什麼，今晚要準備做什麼，進貨需要花多少錢，最近書店賣了多少錢，你身體怎麼樣一大堆，\n\n\n\n  然後對方的回覆往往很敷衍也很高冷，\n\n\n\n  以：\n\n\n\n  「哦」\n\n\n\n  「嗯」\n\n\n\n  「好」\n\n\n\n  來代替。\n\n\n\n  周澤將手機丟一邊，這個人際關係，有點複雜了，他忽然看了一下自己的手掌，自己的指甲和常人沒什麼區別。\n\n\n\n  但自己出車禍前救治的那個老者，自己從無面女人手中脫困，自己進入這個傢伙身體等這些事情上，自己的指甲，起到了極為關鍵的作用。 \n\n\n\n  心隨意動，\n\n\n\n  就在這個時候，\n\n\n\n  周澤發現自己的指甲開始慢慢地變長，同時也變得漆黑通透起來，甚至在指甲上，還有淡淡的黑霧繚繞。\n\n\n\n  「呼…………」\n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  再睜開眼時，\n\n\n\n  指甲又恢復了正常。\n\n\n\n  一直從早上到中午，周澤都坐在那裡嘗試去適應自己的這個新身份，也在平復自己身份轉換所帶來的不適應感，中午飯都沒吃，也不知道是忘記了還是自己根本就不覺得餓。\n\n\n\n  這裡依舊還是通城，周澤以前的家在崇川區，現在則是在港閘區，距離並不遠。\n\n\n\n  到了下午時，周澤才嘆了口氣，默默地站起身，既來之則安之吧。\n\n\n\n  他開始試著打掃書架，總歸，給自己先找點事情做做。\n\n\n\n  那個死前掐過自己的老者曾說過「他被發現了」以及地獄裡無面女說過的「你遲早會被抓住」，讓周澤心裡產生了些許危機感。\n\n\n\n  他現在的狀態，算是「苟活」了，死而復生，是邀天之倖，所以他很珍惜，至少，在沒完全分清楚狀況和掌握足夠線索前，自己得代入這個身份，最好不要引起太大的異常，不要引起那些「要抓他的人」的注意。 \n\n\n\n  這家店的生意，真的很不好，傳統圖書市場的低迷，早就不是一天兩天的事兒了，而且這裡又不是在學校的大門口黃金一條街上。\n\n\n\n  只能說，那個「徐樂」選擇在這裡開一家書店，能不能保本都是一個問題。\n\n\n\n  一直到下午三點鐘的時候，才走進來今天的第一位客人。\n\n\n\n  客人在小學生讀物那邊轉悠著，且轉悠了很長時間。\n\n\n\n  周澤等了一會兒，還是走過去，問道：「選什麼題材的？」\n\n\n\n  雖然，周澤也不懂。\n\n\n\n  「隨便看看。」對方回答道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」周澤也就不再理會了，他現在還沒融入這個「書店老闆」的角色里。\n\n\n\n  但就在這時，\n\n\n\n  對方卻忽然走到了自己身後，幽幽地開口道：\n\n\n\n  「你真的不認識我了？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「昨晚我用棒球棒打了你的頭，搶了你的錢，\n\n\n\n  而且我還特意去試了一下，\n\n\n\n  你那時分明已經沒有鼻息了的。」",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned for a moment. So, the reason he was able to possess \"Xu Le's\" body and resurrect in it last night was because the man had just been killed?\n\nBecause the body was still warm, he was able to enter?\n\nLooked at that way, he... seemed to be quite lucky indeed.\n\nNo disgust, no anger, and certainly no panic at the possibility of his identity being exposed. Zhou Ze turned and looked at the man behind him, who was about his own age.\n\nThe man froze.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy.\n\nIt was relief.\n\nAnd even…\n\na hint of admiration.\n\nGiven the circumstances last night, Zhou Ze knew what a desperate situation he had been in. If this guy hadn't happened to kill someone right at that moment, his own soul might have been scattered to the winds, and he never would have seen today's sun.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night. When I woke up this morning my head felt awful, like I was drunk. I've forgotten what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the man would guess he was a ghost who had possessed a corpse, unless the guy was completely nuts.\n\n\"You're not mad at me?\" the other man asked, pointing at his own nose. He sounded incredulous. \"Even though I just told you I clubbed you from behind yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine. Actually, I should thank you for not taking the phone and computer from my desk.\"\n\n\"Uh... I forgot,\" the man said, scratching his head. \"As long as you're okay. This is the money I stole from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man proactively took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then fumbled around and produced another eight hundred.\n\n\"The eight hundred is for your medical bills, and the three hundred is what I stole,\" the man said, biting his lip. \"I gambled away my salary to some crooked online bookie yesterday. I was passing by your bookstore and suddenly had the idea to get some cash. After I knocked you down, I realized you weren't breathing. It scared me to death.\n\n\"I ran home and couldn't sleep all night, just thinking the police would suddenly break down my door and arrest me. Home invasion, robbery, and murder, all for three hundred yuan. I felt so stupid, so not worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\n\"Buddy, it's so good you're not dead. Really. I've been lurking outside since this morning, waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for the cops to show up. But then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\n\"You know? At that moment, I almost dropped to my knees and kowtowed to you. Thank you. You're tough, you didn't die. Otherwise, I would've been finished. With all these security cameras, I never would've gotten away with it if you'd died.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, then at the \"murderer\" before him who was tearfully confessing, and couldn't help but feel the whole scene was bizarre.\n\nTo be honest, \"Xu Le\" *was* dead. Because he died, Zhou Ze was able to usurp his place. And because Zhou Ze usurped his place, the man before him was spared a murder charge.\n\nHe and the man before him had both benefited. The only unlucky one was the real Xu Le.\n\n\"Alright, it's fine. Maybe last night I just got a sharp pain and passed out,\" Zhou Ze said, moving the man's hand off his shoulder. He used to be an emergency room doctor; what kind of filth hadn't he seen? But in that extreme environment, he had developed a bit of mysophobia. In fact, most ER doctors had it to varying degrees.\n\nIt's precisely because you've seen so much filth that you learn to appreciate \"cleanliness.\"\n\n\"You're really not mad at me?\" the man asked, somewhat delighted.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm not mad,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Go to work, live your life, and don't make the same mistake again.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy. You're a stand-up guy.\"\n\nThe man nodded emphatically, left the bookstore, and went off to greet his \"new life.\"\n\nZhou Ze, however, picked up his phone. He thought for a moment and decided he should still call the police—not to report the man for murdering him (Xu Le), but to report him for suspected theft.\n\nLet the police investigate. If the guy really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and got caught, he'd deserve it.\n\nHe had taken over the man's body; he had to do something for the poor sap.\n\nAlthough, reporting him by name after the guy had shown such a good attitude and even given him medical fees was a real dick move—the kind of thing that curses you to have a son with no asshole.¹\n\nJust as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the operator's voice came on the line,\n\nat the shop entrance,\n\nthe man suddenly returned.\n\n\"There's one more thing...\" The man had just walked in when he saw Zhou Ze on the phone. He froze, then pointed a finger straight at him. \"You son of a bitch, you were going to call the cops anyway, weren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone, give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You went back on your word, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die for real this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly entered a state of agitated excitement. His mental state was likely a bit unstable. Perhaps due to the lifestyle of a long-term gambler, disconnected from society, he was prone to extremes when provoked.\n\nThe man lunged. Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to back away.\n\nIn his past life, he was a doctor, not a boxer, nor had he ever trained in martial arts. This new body was also somewhat frail. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was genuinely flustered.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe man slammed Zhou Ze against the wall, his hands clamping down hard on Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I'll teach you to call the cops! I'll teach you to go back on your word! Fine, I'll make you die, really die! This time I'll strangle you and then bleed you out! Let's see if you're still not dead then!\" the man roared, gritting his teeth.\n\nThe bookstore business was pitiful. In the afternoon, there were no customers, and hardly even any pedestrians outside.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he could no longer breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. In the process, his fingernails suddenly turned black and grew long.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze wrapped his arms around the man's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, his eyes rolled back, and he let go of Zhou Ze's neck. He stumbled back a few steps, knocking over several bookshelves before crashing to the floor.\n\nFreed, Zhou Ze rubbed his neck. He hadn't actually been that panicked. After all, his fingernails could harm even the vicious ghosts of Hell; dealing with an ordinary person shouldn't be much of a problem, right?\n\nBut as for the specific reason for these nails or their purpose, Zhou Ze wasn't entirely sure yet. He only knew they were likely \"transmitted\" to him by the old man he had tried to save before his car accident.\n\nIt's true what they say...\n\n*Got one fungal nail, and it infects the next one.*²\n\nHe walked over, squatted down, and patted the man's face. Thankfully, he wasn't dead, still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n...\n\nAfter giving his statement at the police station, the officer told Zhou Ze to wait in the small lobby. Because the incident Zhou Ze reported was a bit bizarre—claiming that the man who had come to rob him was the one who ended up knocked out—and since the \"assailant\" was still in the hospital, they had to wait for him to wake up for further confirmation.\n\nStill, at least the police officer hadn't put Zhou Ze in handcuffs.\n\nSquatting next to Zhou Ze was a middle-aged man whose left hand was cuffed to a radiator pipe.\n\n\"Damn, dude, you're a badass. The guy tried to rob you and you're the one who laid him out?\" the scruffy-looking middle-aged man said while rubbing his grimy, long bangs. \"That's the spirit I had when I was young. For these clueless petty thieves, you gotta beat 'em to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you, behave yourself,\" a young police officer said, walking over to scold him. \"How many times have you been caught stealing scooter batteries this winter?\n\n\"I'm telling you, the New Year is almost here, can't you just behave? Or find a proper job and earn some money to send home? You're a grown man.\"\n\n\"Work? Working is impossible. I'll never work in this life. I don't know how to do business. I can only get by like this, by stealing scooter batteries. Going to the detention center feels like going home.\n\n\"Everyone in there is a talent, and they talk so nicely. I love it in there!\"³\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young officer didn't want to deal with this character anymore and turned to leave.\n\n\"Bro, what did you think of my speech just now?\" the greasy middle-aged man asked, winking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Pretty interesting,\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol. Che Guevara, you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"I'm telling you, you gotta live your life...\" the greasy middle-aged man froze, his gaze shifting to the entrance. \"Holy crap, she's gorgeous. Is she a cop?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the entrance, a woman in a blue down jacket and long leather boots was walking toward them with another female officer.\n\n\"Probably a cop,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, it was the aura she possessed that was the biggest plus.\n\n\"But she's not in uniform,\" the greasy man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe she's plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right. A beautiful policewoman... damn,\" the greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, as if savoring the thought. \"Looks like I'll have to come in here more often. I'd give up ten years of my life to marry her.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. When it came to things like lifespan, he didn't dare joke about it anymore.\n\n\"You disagree?\" Seeing Zhou Ze shake his head, the greasy man grew agitated. \"You're blind! For a woman like that, trading ten years of your life is an absolute bargain...\"\n\nJust then, the female officer and the woman in boots walked right up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to take you home. The investigation is clear, you're free to go,\" the female officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" said the greasy middle-aged man.\n\n---\n¹ A literal translation of the curse `生兒子沒屁眼兒` (shēng érzi méi pìyǎnr), which means \"to give birth to a son with no asshole.\" It's a common and very vulgar curse in Chinese, implying someone has acted so reprehensibly that they deserve this karmic misfortune upon their family line.\n\n² A literal translation of a famous and slightly cheesy advertising slogan in China for a fungal nail treatment: `得了灰指甲，一個傳染倆`. The humor comes from applying this mundane slogan to a supernatural ability.\n\n³ This is a word-for-word quote from a famous Chinese internet meme. It comes from a viral news interview with a man named Zhou Liqi, who was repeatedly arrested for theft. His philosophical and unrepentant monologue on why he prefers stealing to working made him an internet celebrity, often referred to as \"Steal-a-moto.\"",

    "content": "Officer, excuse me, what was my wife's name again?\n\nThis thought only crossed his mind for a moment; Zhou Ze wasn't *that* stupid. But he genuinely didn't know his \"wife's\" real name. In this day and age, very few people used their real names for their QQ or WeChat usernames.\n\nThe greasy-looking man, however, glanced at Zhou Ze with a mournful expression: Bro, that's not cool. We were supposed to be each other's broken-winged angels, remember?¹\n\nZhou Ze glanced back helplessly: This was a surprise to me, too.\n\nThe greasy-looking man lowered his head, sighed, and muttered under his breath, \"I make really good dumplings.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nHis \"wife\" spoke coldly, then turned and walked out on her own.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow.\n\nShe was driving a Porsche Cayenne and got directly into the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the passenger door and sat down.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nit was a little awkward.\n\nIf that unlucky bastard Xu Le had a slightly more normal marital and family life, Zhou Ze wouldn't be in such an awkward position right now. Faced with his beautiful wife's concern, he could have come up with some excuses, like feeling dizzy and unable to remember certain things.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the air of an ice queen, looking as if she had no interest in talking to him at all. Even picking him up from the police station seemed like a mere formality.\n\nMy dog ran away, the security guard found it,\nI went to pick it up.\n\nThat's what it felt like.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as him (Xu Le), and a good few years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car got onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence again.\n\nThe woman felt her husband was being unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to investigate the reason.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She put it on speaker, and a voice came through the car's sound system:\n\n\"Doctor Lin, there's been a school bus collision on Qingnian Middle Road. The injured are already being sent to our hospital. The Director wants you back immediately.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly taken aback.\n\nSo his wife was a doctor, too.\n\nAnd,\n\nso his wife's surname was \"Lin.\"\n\n\"I know, I'll be right back.\" The woman hung up, immediately exited the elevated highway, and made a sharp turn at the traffic light, heading toward the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or tell him to get out and take a taxi. Instead, she drove all the way into the parking lot of the Chongchuan District People's Hospital.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze had been worried she would tell him to get out and hail a cab home. He imagined having to shamelessly ask:\n\n\"Honey, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\nThe thought alone felt idiotic.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got into an elevator, and Zhou Ze followed her into the elevator. The woman entered the women's locker room, and Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench in the hallway.\n\nJust then, the first batch of crash victims arrived. One was seriously injured, and five other children also had significant injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and immediately get busy with treatment,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench in a daze.\n\nThis feeling was a bit like a mother bringing her son to work; while the mother worked, the son would watch from the side, playing by himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe hospital's characteristic smell of disinfectant and the stuffy heat of the central air conditioning... it was a nostalgic, familiar feeling.\n\nThe emergency room was just ahead. The critically injured patient seemed to be a little girl.\n\nThe accident had involved a kindergarten school bus. Watching the children crying in pain on the operating tables was a truly heart-wrenching sight.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. In the past, at a time like this, he would have already changed his clothes and joined the rescue efforts. He was the most famous surgeon of the younger generation in Tongcheng, but now, he could only be a spectator.\n\nIt was a very uncomfortable feeling, but he could only endure it. Besides, this People's Hospital was considered the best in Tongcheng, at least on paper, with an undeniable quantity and quality of doctors. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. Their injuries were minor, only requiring wound cleaning or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were stationed at the entrance to the floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, their emotions running high, but letting them in at this moment would likely disrupt the treatment process, so they could only be held back for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, and walked to the window at the far end of the hallway. He pushed the window open, then took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. He smoked, and so did Xu Le, which was convenient at this moment.\n\n\"Mister, you're not allowed to smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nJust as he put a cigarette between his lips, the clear voice of a little girl came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze turned around to see a little girl in a lily-white dress standing behind him, her lips pouted as she looked at him indignantly.\n\nAhem,\n\nhow embarrassing.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public etiquette was always a bit mortifying.\n\n\"Aren't you cold in just that, little one?\" Zhou Ze asked, bending down.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a touch of baby fat on her cheeks, and big eyes. She was very cute, like an oversized Barbie doll.\n\n\"I'm not cold.\" The little girl shook her head. \"Mister, you can't smoke in the hospital again, okay?\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded seriously.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine. The other children are all hurt. They're in a lot of pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways, looking at the other children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying. It wasn't really because the pain was unbearable, but rather because once one person started crying, the others followed suit.\n\nThe nurses had to console the children while treating their wounds.\n\nOutside, the parents, temporarily blocked by the traffic police, were constantly shouting and cursing.\n\nIn short,\n\nthe entire floor felt chaotic.\n\n\"You're very lucky, then,\" Zhou Ze remarked.\n\nThe little girl didn't have a single scratch on her.\n\n\"Yep, I was sitting in the back row, so I'm okay.\" The little girl nodded, then took the initiative to run over and comfort her classmates, checking on one, peeking at another, encouraging and calming them.\n\nShe was a very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and subconsciously took out his cigarettes again, but after a moment's thought, he put them back.\n\nAs he walked back to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors came out of the emergency room ahead.\n\nOne was a male doctor, and the other was a female doctor—his wife.\n\n\"It's okay. We did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to place a comforting hand on his wife's shoulder.\n\nAs her husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nbut he wasn't offended by the scene...\n\nThat damn Xu Le had left him in such a complicated mess—a live-in son-in-law with a hot-tempered sister-in-law and an obviously ill-tempered mother- and father-in-law.\n\nZhou Ze was practically hoping his wife would hurry up and have an affair, kick him out, and get a divorce so he could be left in peace.\n\nWho, having just been reborn into a new body, would be eager to deal with the many flavors of life as a modern-day live-in son-in-law?\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze's surprise, his wife actually blocked the doctor's wandering hand and pointed directly at him, saying:\n\n\"That's my husband.\"\n\nHer words held not a trace of tenderness. They were simple, stiff, as if to say, \"This is the husky I keep at home.\"\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir.\" The male doctor's expression was a bit awkward. No matter what, hitting on a woman right in front of her husband always leaves one feeling a little short on confidence.\n\nZhou Ze smiled as a form of greeting. It seemed his wife was quite faithful... but he couldn't bring himself to feel happy about it. It wasn't some cuckold complex acting up,\n\nit was simply that life would be so much better if it were simpler.\n\n\"I'll go check on the others. The other children have been treated and should be fine. You and your husband should go home and get some rest soon,\" the male doctor said before walking away.\n\nDoctor Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves, tossing them on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and she was gently biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a bad mood, which meant they hadn't been able to save the severely injured child.\n\nThis appearance of hers was quite 'pitiable.'\n\nIn his heart, Zhou Ze began to understand Xu Le a little. This live-in son-in-law had it much better than his peers. His in-laws being better off than him was a given, but on top of that, this Doctor Lin was genuinely beautiful.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience this a lot more in the future. Just seek peace of mind.\"\n\nZhou Ze offered his comfort as a veteran. His experience far surpassed that of his \"wife,\" and his psychological resilience was naturally much stronger.\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThose were the two words the woman returned. If Zhou Ze had said this in his original capacity as a senior, it would have been genuine guidance.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le, and for someone with his image to say such things to Doctor Lin was purely a case of it being easy for him to say.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze shrugged, once again scorning that Xu Le in his mind. *Look how pathetic you are, your wife dares to tell you to shut up in public.*\n\nWith red eyes, Doctor Lin slowly stood up. \"I'm going to change. Let's go home.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt that moment, two nurses pulled back the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on it, covered by a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over it. He had seen many dead people. In his years as a doctor, he had saved many lives, but there had also been quite a few patients who had died right in front of him, leaving him powerless.\n\n\"Doctor Lin, that's your husband, right?\" a young nurse asked in a teasing tone. They knew Doctor Lin was married, but unlike the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses, her husband had never shown his face at the hospital.\n\nYou couldn't blame them for cracking a joke in the face of death. It was like expecting those artsy types who post on social media about how their souls have been purified and how moved and pious they feel after one trip to Tibet to actually stay there for ten years—it's just not realistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Doctor Lin nodded in response. By now, her emotions had calmed down a bit.\n\n\"Then you two should hurry home. Who knows what kind of 'activities' you'll have when you get back, right?\n\nI'm telling you, our Doctor Lin loves kids. You two should hurry home and get to...\"\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\n\"...\" The young nurse fell silent.\n\nZhou Ze had seen the hem of a lily-white dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind roared as he suddenly realized that the little girl he had just seen, completely unharmed,\n\nwasn't human!\n\n***\n¹A popular internet slang phrase, often used humorously between friends to mean they'll stick together through misfortune.",

    "content": "This \"Fuck,\"\n\nAfter he said it,\n\nThe two young nurses were at a loss, and Dr. Lin also froze for a moment.\n\nIt was just too simple and crude a response.\n\nZhou Ze offered no explanation, simply reaching out and pulling back the white cloth covering the girl's head.\n\nIt was her. It really was her!\n\nNo wonder she didn't have a single injury earlier.\n\nNot even a scratch on her body.\n\nThis wasn't because she was lucky enough to be sitting in the back row.\n\nIn reality,\n\nShe was the most severely injured of all the children; she was the one the doctors had just been trying their utmost to save.\n\nHer soul had already drifted out, yet she remained unaware. She was still reminding him not to smoke in public, still going to comfort her classmates who had suffered minor injuries.\n\nIn truth,\n\nThose children couldn't see her at all.\n\nIn the entire hospital,\n\nThe only person who could see her,\n\nWas Zhou Ze!\n\n\"She's dead?\" Zhou Ze asked as his eyes scanned the surroundings.\n\n\"Xu Le?\" Dr. Lin looked at her husband. She didn't want to deal with his cursing right now, because she realized her husband was acting strangely.\n\n\"She's not dead yet! Keep saving her, keep trying to resuscitate her!\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly grabbed Dr. Lin's arm, pulled her over, and roared,\n\n\"The time limit for resuscitation isn't up yet! There's still a chance she could wake up! Keep trying!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze grabbing Dr. Lin so violently, the two nurses immediately moved forward to pull him away. In their eyes, Dr. Lin's husband was being nonsensical and even showing signs of domestic abuse.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the two nurses aside, also releasing his grip, and muttered under his breath,\n\n\"Where are you? Where are you? Where in the world are you!\"\n\nZhou Ze rushed out. He was running, searching.\n\nJust a moment ago, the girl's soul had been wandering among the children, comforting them. Now, she was nowhere to be found.\n\nHad she already gone to hell?\n\nShe was already dead.\n\nWas it too late?\n\nZhou Ze felt a little lost. He didn't know why he was so agitated, nor why he felt such urgency.\n\nPerhaps it was because of his profession; it was his duty to treat any patient who had a chance of survival. And besides, he'd just had an encounter with that kind and strong girl.\n\n\"Mister, are you looking for me?\"\n\nA familiar child's voice sounded from behind Zhou Ze. He immediately turned around and saw the little girl again.\n\nOnly now, the little girl's body was not as solid as before; she had become semi-transparent.\n\n\"Mister, I'm a little cold.\" The little girl squatted down, hugging her arms. \"I went to ask the nurses to lend me a piece of clothing, but they ignored me. Do they hate me? Am I really unlikable?\"\n\nSpecks of light continuously dissipated from the little girl's body. Zhou Ze had seen this before; it had happened to him back then.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\n\nDr. Lin walked over at that moment.\n\nThe little girl turned her head to look behind her.\n\n\"Don't look!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward, reaching out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen when she saw her own body lying on the hospital bed.\n\nWould she break down?\n\nWould she realize she was dead and simply dissipate?\n\nWhen Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, his fingernails grew slightly warm. They didn't grow longer or turn black, but Zhou Ze felt an intense heat. At the same time, the little girl's body began to distort, transforming into a ring of light that coiled around Zhou Ze's fingertips. This light was clearly invisible to everyone else.\n\n\"Get out of the way! She can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze charged toward the hospital bed again.\n\n\"Xu Le!\" Dr. Lin's chest heaved. The dead was dead. She didn't know what nonsense her husband was still spouting, and besides, her husband had studied civil engineering; he had no connection to medicine whatsoever.\n\nThis time, when Zhou Ze rushed over, the two young nurses didn't dare to block him. Zhou Ze flung back the white cloth and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\n\nYes, this was how he had come back to life.\n\n*Your soul came out,*\n\n*It can go back in,*\n\n*You can live!*\n\nAfter seeing the light from his fingertips completely merge into the girl's body, Zhou Ze began to perform CPR, pressing on the girl's chest with his hands stacked.\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\nThe two nurses didn't dare to get close; they both looked at Dr. Lin.\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\nDr. Lin walked to Zhou Ze's side and said.\n\n\"We're still within the golden hour for resuscitation! I've been keeping track of the time!\" Zhou Ze roared while continuing to press down. \"She can live, she can live!\"\n\nDr. Lin pursed her lips, then directly pushed Zhou Ze aside. She then began pressing on the girl's chest with her own stacked hands.\n\n\"Your force is too strong. She has internal injuries. A Chun, reconnect the monitor. Continue resuscitation.\"\n\nZhou Ze was pushed away but didn't get angry, merely continuing to stare at the little girl on the bed.\n\nThe only saving grace was likely that the parents were being held back by the traffic police, and with so many children making a racket outside, no one noticed what was happening here.\n\nDr. Lin continued the compressions, beads of sweat already forming on her forehead. She didn't know why she was joining this man in his madness, but for some reason, she had just seen an unusual meaning in his eyes.\n\nAnd this man was her husband. Today, she felt she couldn't see through him at all.\n\nThe monitor was reconnected, but the screen still showed a flat line.\n\nThe two young nurses stood by, at a loss.\n\n*She can't be saved?*\n\n*Even after I put her soul back,*\n\n*She still can't be saved?*\n\nA sense of loss and disappointment began to spread through Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n\"Beep... Beep... Beep...\"\n\nJust then,\n\nThe flat line suddenly rippled.\n\nDr. Lin stared at the monitor in utter shock.\n\nThis...\n\nWas this a medical miracle?\n\n***\n\nIt was already night when they drove home from the hospital. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat while Dr. Lin drove. The two were still not speaking.\n\nSilence, it seemed, was the standard setting for their husband-and-wife relationship. However, in the past, it was always Xu Le who tried to break the silence. Today, it was Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Have you studied medicine?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Your technique just now was very professional,\" Dr. Lin could tell.\n\n\"I had training when I was studying for my driver's license,\" Zhou Ze casually invented an excuse.\n\n\"But you don't have a driver's license.\" Dr. Lin frowned slightly.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n*Hmph.* In his heart, Zhou Ze silently cursed Xu Le once again.\n\nDr. Lin didn't intend to press the matter further. She just said, \"Today, thank you for your persistence.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least in his heart, he still considered himself a doctor, saving a patient truly required no thanks.\n\nThe girl hadn't woken up yet and was still in a coma, but at least there was hope now.\n\n\"I thank you on behalf of that girl.\" Dr. Lin picked up her phone to check the time. \"It's almost eight. My parents are still waiting for us to come home for dinner.\"\n\n*Parents?*\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a massive headache coming on.\n\n*Am I about to meet my mother-in-law and father-in-law?*\n\nThe car pulled into a high-end residential community. Tongcheng was close to Shanghai, located on opposite ends of the Yangtze River Delta. While property here wasn't as extremely expensive as in Shanghai, the housing prices were not cheap either.\n\nDr. Lin parked the car and walked inside. Zhou Ze followed behind her. They entered the elevator, got out together, and Dr. Lin used her key to open a door.\n\nThe apartment was well-decorated with a duplex layout. In fact, one could tell from the car Dr. Lin drove that the Lin family was likely very well-off.\n\nOf course, his current identity as a \"live-in son-in-law\" was also proof. After all, a family without some money and confidence couldn't afford to take in a son-in-law.\n\nOn the living room sofa, an elderly man with half-gray hair and wearing a sweater was watching TV—a rebroadcast of the evening news. He watched with great interest.\n\nEven when his own daughter and son-in-law returned, he merely glanced at them without saying anything.\n\n\"Wanqiu, you're back.\"\n\nThe kitchen door was pushed open, and the mother-in-law poked her head out. Perhaps Dr. Lin and her younger sister had inherited their height from their mother. The mother-in-law was very tall. She was a bit plump now, but she was still the kind of woman who could reign supreme at the \"Sunset Red\"¹ square dances, causing countless old men and grandfathers to compete for her favor.\n\n*Knock on the blackboard, take notes, highlight the key points.*\n\nZhou Ze finally knew his wife's full name—Lin Wanqiu.\n\nThe mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze, her expression clearly sinking.\n\n\"Old man, time to eat. Wanqiu's back.\"\n\n\"Finally, we can eat,\" the sister-in-law said as she walked out of the study. She shook a fist at Zhou Ze, then jutted her chin, signaling for him to be mindful of her parents.\n\nThis small gesture was actually quite nice. Although the girl was a bit bossy, she wasn't too over the top.\n\nZhou Ze went to the bathroom to wash his hands. As he was washing them, Lin Wanqiu also came in. The two of them used soap to scrub their hands together, both doing it very meticulously.\n\nLin Wanqiu's eyes lingered on Zhou Ze for a couple of extra moments before she rinsed her hands and walked into the living room.\n\nZhou Ze also rinsed his hands, dried them with a paper towel, and walked out of the bathroom.\n\nEveryone was seated. Zhou Ze sat down in the chair next to Lin Wanqiu.\n\nWith a grim face, the mother-in-law brought the bowls of rice over one by one. When she placed one in front of Zhou Ze, she clearly used a bit more force.\n\n*Well, at least,*\n\n*She didn't deliberately not give me any rice.*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n\"Xu Le, do you think we treat you poorly?\" the mother-in-law asked before even starting to eat.\n\n\"You treat me very well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then you didn't come home last night. Who were you trying to give the cold shoulder to—\"\n\n\"Mom, let's eat. He had some things to deal with at his shop. He told me,\" Lin Wanqiu cut in.\n\nThe mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged a glance, surprised that their elder daughter was actually speaking up for this son-in-law. It made them so uncomfortable that they momentarily forgot to continue their tirade.\n\nThe sister-in-law, watching from the side, was also a little surprised. Her sister had never cared much about her so-called brother-in-law. Had the sun risen from the west today?\n\n\"Let's eat.\" The father-in-law picked up his chopsticks to signal. \"You eat too.\" The father-in-law pointed his chopsticks specifically at Zhou Ze.\n\n*Hmph, that gesture is a bit rude, but at least it signals that last night's incident is over.*\n\n\"Wanqiu, have a piece of braised pork. Mom stewed it for a long time.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law placed a piece of meat in both her elder and younger daughters' bowls. Then, after a moment's hesitation, she put a piece in her son-in-law's bowl as well.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze realize he hadn't eaten anything all day. From his reincarnation last night, through the morning and noon, he hadn't eaten a thing.\n\nHe didn't stand on ceremony.\n\nHe picked up the meat and put it in his mouth.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze's expression froze.\n\nAn unexpected wave of nausea rose from his heart, and his stomach began to spasm violently.\n\n\"Gag...\" Zhou Ze retched dryly, as if what he was eating was poison.\n\n\"...\" said the mother-in-law.\n\n\"...\" said the father-in-law.\n\nThe atmosphere at the dinner table,\n\nInstantly plunged to a freezing point.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Sunset Red (夕陽紅):** A poetic term for the elderly in China. \"Sunset Red square dances\" refers to the common sight of senior citizens gathering in public squares for group dancing.",

    "content": "\"My apologies.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand to show he didn't mean it, because this was a huge slap in the face, especially since he didn't know why \"Xu Le,\" this live-in son-in-law, was so disliked by his parents-in-law.\n\n\"Not feeling well?\" Dr. Lin asked, putting down her chopsticks.\n\n\"It's nothing, it's nothing.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled some rice into his mouth.\n\nBut just as the rice entered his mouth, before he could swallow,\n\nhis stomach spasmed again, and a profound sense of nausea welled up from deep within him, as if what he was about to swallow wasn't rice, but the son of rice—feces.¹\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThis time,\n\nZhou Ze sprayed the mouthful of rice all over his parents-in-law, who were sitting opposite him.\n\nGrains of rice clung to his father-in-law's glasses and hair.\n\nHis mother-in-law's coiled-up hair was also speckled with glistening white flecks.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nThe chopsticks fell from his father-in-law's hand. His face twitched a few times, as if he hadn't yet processed what emotion to respond with.\n\nHis mother-in-law, however, took a deep breath, the fury in her eyes already blazing!\n\nThis was...\n\nthrowing kindness back in their faces!\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe mother-in-law pushed her chair back and stood up.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law was a retired head nurse, so she knew that even if someone was sick, they wouldn't spray rice so dramatically. Besides, from the look of him, Xu Le didn't seem to be on death's door.\n\nHe was doing this on purpose.\n\nHe must be doing this on purpose!\n\nHe was rebelling!\n\nRebelling!\n\nClutching his chest, Zhou Ze left the table and rushed into the bathroom. He lifted the toilet lid and began to retch violently.\n\nThis time, he even threw up bile, and a bitter taste filled his mouth.\n\nThis meal was a lost cause.\n\nDr. Lin glanced toward the bathroom, where Xu Le was still retching nonstop, and said directly to her younger sister,\n\n\"Xiao Yi, go cook some noodles.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. She also felt that her brother-in-law was playing with fire today. She immediately left the table and went to the kitchen to prepare some dried noodles.\n\n\"How outrageous! That scoundrel!\"\n\nThe father-in-law slammed his hand on the table and took off his glasses to shake them clean. Xu Le's father-in-law was a retired vice-director of the hospital and prized his gentlemanly appearance above all else. Today, that line had been crossed.\n\n\"I'm going to go ask that guy where exactly our family wronged him! We didn't ask for a single cent of a bride price for the wedding, we even paid to open that money-losing bookstore for him. Where did we wrong him!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law prepared to march to the bathroom.\n\n\"Mom, let's clean this up. He's not feeling well.\"\n\nDr. Lin began to clear the barely touched plates from the table.\n\n\"You're still defending him after all this?\" The mother-in-law's anger flared as she pointed a finger at her daughter and scolded her.\n\n\"What else can I do? Who was it that threatened to hang themselves to force me to marry him?\" Dr. Lin looked directly at her mother, her beautiful face looking exceptionally resolute at that moment.\n\nThe mother-in-law was at a loss for words. It was true. They were the ones who had forced their daughter to marry. They were desperate to have a grandson, so they had gone to great lengths to recruit Xu Le as a live-in son-in-law. The thinking had been simple at the time: she and her husband only had two daughters, so their only option was to recruit a son-in-law so the grandson would take their family name. And Xu Le, whose parents were both gone, was a college graduate who fit the criteria.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nThe father-in-law didn't dare meet his daughter's gaze. He was the one who had made the final decision back then. Thinking about it now, he did feel he had wronged his daughter. He got up and went back to his study.\n\n\"Hey, old man, you have stomach problems,\" his wife called out anxiously.\n\n\"Mom, bring Dad a bowl of noodles later.\"\n\nDr. Lin finished clearing the table, then walked toward the bathroom.\n\nThe mother-in-law watched her daughter's back, but in the end, said nothing more.\n\nPushing open the frosted glass door of the bathroom, Dr. Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling by the toilet, one hand gripping the edge of the bowl, the other clutching his chest.\n\n\"Are you unwell?\"\n\n\"I'm okay,\" Zhou Ze replied. He had been perfectly fine before dinner; who knew he'd end up like this the moment he tried to eat?\n\n\"I had Xiao Yi make some noodles. You can eat some later...\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nThe mere thought of noodles made another powerful wave of nausea rise from deep within Zhou Ze, and he started dry-heaving again.\n\nLin Wanqiu frowned slightly.\n\n\"Should we go to the hospital?\"\n\n\"No need, it's fine. I'm not eating anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, struggling to his feet. He went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face.\n\nTonight's dinner was destined to end on a sour note.\n\nHis parents-in-law and sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu's bedroom was on the second.\n\nAfter cleaning up, Zhou Ze took a quick shower. Because he didn't know where his change of clothes was, he didn't bother changing, and went upstairs still wearing his old clothes, his hair dripping wet. As soon as he reached the landing, he saw that Lin Wanqiu was showering in the second-floor bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the bathroom door for a moment, watching the graceful silhouette reflected within, and lightly licked his lips.\n\nA man is always at his most impulsive at times like this. Of course, it's also at times like this that he best understands gratitude.\n\n\"Thank you,\"\n\nZhou Ze murmured in his heart.\n\nThis was the first time in the two days since he'd possessed this body that Zhou Ze gave that unlucky bastard Xu Le a thumbs-up.\n\n*Even though you left behind some incredibly screwed-up relationships, your wife... is truly beautiful.*\n\nWith a hint of fantasy, a hint of excitement, a hint of impatience, a hint of expectation,\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door,\n\nand then,\n\nthe color drained from Zhou Ze's face. He bit his lip,\n\nand in his mind, he dragged out the same Xu Le he had just praised and viciously flogged his corpse ten thousand times.\n\nThe bedroom was large.\n\nThere was a big bed.\n\nAnd next to the big bed,\n\nwas a pallet on the floor!\n\nEven an idiot could figure out what this meant!\n\nIs that guy sick in the head?\n\nIs he a moron?\n\nWhat's the point of being a live-in son-in-law like this?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths, then silently lay down on the floor pallet.\n\n*Just sleep.*\n\n*No more drama.*\n\n*Don't think about it.*\n\nHe would see if he could get some money, become independent, and then whether it was divorce or something else, just resolve this complicated mess. He had come back from the dead, and there were still many problems to face.\n\nLin Wanqiu finished her shower and came out. She was wearing a blue nightgown. It was a bit loose, looking rather large on her.\n\nLying on the pallet, Zhou Ze subconsciously swallowed.\n\n\"Get up,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"You've always slept on the bed. I sleep on the floor,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze silently got up and climbed into the bed.\n\nLin Wanqiu turned off the light and lay down on the pallet on the floor.\n\nPerhaps this was her form of compensation for being unwilling to share a bed with Xu Le. She slept on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze sighed,\n\nand prepared to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, he wasn't asleep. He turned over.\n\nAn hour later, he wasn't asleep. He turned over.\n\nThree hours later, past midnight, he was still wide awake.\n\nHis eyelids were fighting to close, but he just couldn't fall asleep.\n\nOn the floor, Lin Wanqiu's breathing was steady. She must be asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it absolutely wasn't because there was a beautiful woman sleeping nearby that he was too worked up to sleep;\n\nhe was exhausted and worn out, especially after everything that had happened today.\n\nBut he just couldn't fucking sleep.\n\nLying in bed, Zhou Ze simply opened his eyes and looked at his hands.\n\nToday, he had used these hands to save that little girl's life. Although the girl hadn't woken up yet, her vital signs had returned. There was still hope for her.\n\nWas this a special ability he'd gained after his trip through hell?\n\nOr,\n\nwas it something that old man had left him when he grabbed his wrist before he died?\n\nStill,\n\nit felt pretty good.\n\nAs a doctor, with a pair of hands like this, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that transcended medical technology and understanding, one that could even allow him to reach a level beyond Hua Tuo and Bian Que. Practitioners in every field hope to one day surpass the founders of their craft. Perhaps it wasn't for money, or for fame, but a kind of... calling.\n\nBut just then,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt his arms twitch, and a sharp pain attacked him.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze sucked in a sharp breath, his whole body curling up on the bed.\n\nBut the pain continued, and it was escalating!\n\nThe pain was so intense that Zhou Ze broke out in a cold sweat. Unable to bear it, he got off the bed and left the bedroom.\n\nHe went into the bathroom. Without turning on the light, he sat down on the toilet. At that moment, Zhou Ze saw that from his upper arms all the way to his fingernails, bulging green veins looked as if they were about to split open.\n\nThe pain came from them, as if something were hammering at his very marrow.\n\nDamn it,\n\nwhat the hell is happening!\n\nZhou Ze's face began to twist in agony.\n\nThis feeling was excruciating, even making him want to grab a kitchen knife and chop off his own arms.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to recall the image of himself lying in an ice-cold coffin, about to be pushed into the cremator.\n\nHe also seemed to recall fragments of his soulless march toward the end in hell.\n\nIs this a curse?\n\nIs this a punishment?\n\nWhat am I being punished for?\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I snuck back?\n\nBecause I'm not a living person, so heaven is punishing me?\n\nOr... because I used it to save someone today?\n\n*That's it, that must be the reason.*\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he had used that ability to save someone, he had broken some rule and was now suffering the backlash?\n\nThen,\n\nthen if I went and killed that girl now, would the pain stop?\n\nA wisp of black mist began to coalesce in Zhou Ze's eyes, though he was completely unaware of it.\n\n\"Mister, you can't smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nThe little girl's voice echoed in Zhou Ze's mind again.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head violently.\n\n*No.*\n\n*I saved her, and that's that!*\n\n*I don't regret it.*\n\n*I don't regret it!*\n\n..............\n\n\"Mom, are you not done yet?\"\n\n\"I just got in. Go use the bathroom on the second floor.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law headed upstairs. She really couldn't hold it anymore. The second-floor bathroom light was off. She pushed the door open and walked right in.\n\nAnd then,\n\nat that very moment,\n\nZhou Ze looked up at her.\n\nShe also looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, the black mist swirled, carrying an overwhelming, terrifying power. It was the gaze of a vicious demon that had clawed its way out of hell, full of curses and madness.\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law screamed in terror\n\nand fell to the floor.\n\nShe stared at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was also staring at her.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw the area below his sister-in-law's pajama bottoms—it was wet. An incongruous liquid had appeared on the tile floor...\n\nHad he...\n\nscared her into peeing herself?\n\n***\n\n¹In Chinese, the characters for \"rice\" (米), \"field\" (田), and \"together\" (共) can be stacked to form the character for \"feces\" (糞).",

    "content": "A scream woke the whole family.\n\nAnd no wonder.\n\nIn the middle of the night, in a bathroom with the lights off, opening the door while holding in your pee only to suddenly see someone inside—that alone is frightening enough. I believe most people have had a similar experience.\n\nWhat's more, the person his sister-in-law ran into was a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and pulled her younger sister up.\n\n\"What's wrong? What's wrong!\"\n\nHis father-in-law and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor. They saw their younger daughter crying in her sister's arms, then glanced at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"You, Xu Le! You lard-brained bastard, how dare you try something with my younger daughter!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law grabbed the broom by the bathroom door, ready to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was the same, fuming as he prepared to come in and teach his bastard son-in-law a lesson.\n\nIt was no wonder.\n\nSeeing this scene, everyone would naturally jump to that conclusion.\n\nThe brother-in-law has gone mad, made a move on his sister-in-law.\n\nAfter all, as the old saying goes, half of a sister-in-law's... *you-know-what*... belongs to the brother-in-law.¹\n\n\"Mom, Dad, Xiao Yi just got scared when she went into the bathroom,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law froze. The broom in her hand was raised, but she didn't know where to put it.\n\nThe father-in-law also stiffened, then retreated a few steps, looking embarrassed.\n\nDistracted by the interruption, Zhou Ze suddenly realized that the bulging blue veins on his arms had receded at some point, and the intense pain had vanished along with them.\n\nRight then, he felt exhausted and sleepy. He desperately wanted to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, preparing to leave the bathroom. As for his father- and mother-in-law, Zhou Ze really couldn't be bothered to argue with them. He had no interest in cleaning up the mess for that coward, Xu Le.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze stood up, his sister-in-law immediately started trembling, burrowing deeper into her sister's arms.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. *What did she see just now?*\n\n\"What on earth is going on!\" The mother-in-law put her hands on her hips and asked her younger daughter. This didn't seem like a reaction from just being scared. \"Xiao Yi, my sweet darling, tell Mommy, what really happened? Did he... *do something* to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was an honest girl, and she knew she couldn't lie about something like this, or the consequences would be very serious.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, and when I opened the door, I saw him sitting in there. It was terrifying!\"\n\nAfter mustering the courage to say this, the sister-in-law buried her head in her sister's embrace again.\n\nAlright, so it was just a misunderstanding after all.\n\n\"You brainless oaf, going to the bathroom at night without turning on the light? You think this is your house, being all stingy and trying to save a few cents on electricity? If you scare my daughter into sickness, how are you going to compensate us...\"\n\nThe mother-in-law started berating Zhou Ze, her finger nearly poking him in the face.\n\nZhou Ze was exhausted. People tend to have very short tempers when they're extremely sleep-deprived. On top of that, Zhou Ze had long since lost his patience with the god-awful family network Xu Le had left him.\n\nIf they weren't sleeping in separate beds, Zhou Ze might not have blown up. But since they were, he couldn't be bothered to take any more crap from his snobbish mother-in-law.\n\n*Smack!*\n\nZhou Ze swung his hand, slapping away the finger his mother-in-law was pointing at him.\n\n\"Leave me alone.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened, clearly in disbelief that this spineless son-in-law of hers would dare speak to her like that.\n\n\"Is that any way to speak to your mother? Have you no manners at all!\" the father-in-law snapped.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to be a divorcee, then by all means, keep lecturing me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze shot back, then shoved his father-in-law aside with his shoulder and walked back to the bedroom.\n\n*Bang!* He slammed the door shut with great force.\n\n\"Unbelievable! Simply unbelievable!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law hurried to her husband's side to soothe his chest.\n\nBut in the end, neither of them dared to continue the confrontation.\n\nAfter all, what Zhou Ze had just said held a great deal of power over them.\n\nAlthough they didn't know what had gotten into their normally timid son-in-law—a man you couldn't get a peep out of even if you hit him with a club—he was right. If their elder daughter got divorced, her next marriage would make her a divorcee. That would be bad for her reputation, and for their family's reputation.\n\nBesides, in their eyes, a woman's value plummeted after a divorce, and she wouldn't be able to find a good family to marry into.\n\nIn truth, a person's character and whether their thinking is feudal has little to do with their education or family circumstances. It ultimately comes down to the individual's own quality.\n\nJust like Xu Le's in-laws right now. No matter how angry they were, they didn't dare provoke their bastard son-in-law any further, terrified that he might actually jump up and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and tried to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later, Zhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door.\n\n\"Xiao Yi is scared. I'm going to sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice. Then she left.\n\n*As if you ever really sleep with me anyway.*\n\n...\n\nThe next day at noon, his father- and mother-in-law were eating lunch.\n\n\"Did he go to the bookstore?\" the father-in-law asked the mother-in-law.\n\n\"Hasn't gotten up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Outrageous,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"Exactly...\"\n\nJust then, the mother-in-law suddenly fell silent, because she saw Zhou Ze coming down the stairs. Zhou Ze's eyes were bloodshot, with severe bags under them.\n\nThe atmosphere grew tense.\n\nPerhaps because of last night's events, Zhou Ze's status as the live-in son-in-law had risen somewhat. At least, his in-laws didn't say anything to provoke him now.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze currently looked like he could grab a knife and start hacking at people at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept over the dining table.\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest.\n\nThe smell of rice... the smell of meat... so nauseating. He felt like throwing up again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out the front door. Breathing in the slightly cool, fresh air outside, he felt a little better.\n\nHis head felt groggy. Zhou Ze began to wander the streets alone. He needed to think about some things quietly, but his current state—desperately sleepy yet unable to sleep—made it difficult to truly calm down.\n\nIt was a conflicting, agonizing feeling. Like walking out of an internet cafe after pulling two all-nighters, or like a middle school student who stayed up all night reading a novel under the covers and had to get up for class the next morning.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. His surroundings felt somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign up ahead.\n\nTongcheng First Affiliated Hospital.\n\nHe'd actually wandered all the way to his old workplace. *Heh, maybe it's just because Tongcheng is too small,* he thought.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the hospital, not to take a trip down memory lane, but to try and get a prescription for some sleeping pills.\n\nHe could bear not eating; at worst, he could just drink a lot of water to fill his stomach and get by for a while. But not sleeping was a long-term form of torture.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar work environment. Zhou Ze saw that on the staff roster album for the Emergency Department on the ground floor, his own photo had been grayed out.\n\nHe then subconsciously walked to his old office. His desk had a new occupant: a middle-aged doctor with a pockmarked face was sitting in his seat. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk; the doctor's surname was Kang.\n\nHe let out a long breath, a hint of melancholy in the sigh.\n\nZhou Ze temporarily forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps this feeling of \"things remaining, but people having changed\" had temporarily suppressed the torment of his sleepiness. Zhou Ze began to wander around the hospital.\n\nHe was reliving the bits and pieces of his life here. His work, his life, and his past—or rather, his previous life.\n\n*I can't go back. I really can't go back,* Zhou Ze repeated to himself in his mind.\n\nThen, without realizing it, he had walked down the stairs to the basement level.\n\nHe stood still. As a doctor who had worked here for many years, he knew the layout of this floor perfectly.\n\nA few equipment storage rooms, and then... the morgue.\n\nHe remembered lying in this hospital's morgue once, where a mortician had applied his makeup.\n\nHe started walking again, heading toward the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to see the place where he had once lain. This was the explanation he gave himself for walking in that direction, but in reality, it was a special feeling, a pull from the unseen, that was guiding him forward.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the door to the morgue. It had an electronic keypad lock. Coincidentally, Zhou Ze remembered the code. Doctors from other departments probably wouldn't have much to do with this place, but Zhou Ze had been in the ER. People brought to the emergency room were generally severe cases, and it was inevitable that some couldn't be saved and had to be sent here.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also served as a morgue for the police department. Some unidentified bodies or those that still needed to be \"processed\" would be temporarily stored here. This was common practice in many places; if the local police lacked facilities or had insufficient forensic staff, bodies were often kept at the local funeral home or hospital.\n\nHe entered the code. The lock clicked open, and Zhou Ze walked in.\n\nA chill washed over him. Not the kind that pricks the skin, but a special, grim coldness that seemed to extinguish the warmth inside his heart.\n\nInside the morgue, naturally, were bodies. This was a temporary resting place for the dead.\n\nNormally, there should have been an attendant on duty outside, but for some reason, Zhou Ze hadn't seen anyone when he came in. Perhaps the person was slacking off.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. A few bodies were laid out on cold gurneys, covered with white sheets. Another body was wrapped in a floral quilt from home. Judging by the silver hair peeking out, the deceased was likely an elderly woman.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze had never been particularly afraid of corpses. What's more, he himself was now a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the refrigerated cabinets—the kind with drawers that could be pulled out, one on top of the other.\n\nThe occupied drawers had labels on the outside, recording the deceased's name, gender, and other information.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty drawer. He reached inside, closed his eyes, and slowly took in the sensation. A feeling of intoxication gradually washed over him, as if only here could he find peace.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Zhou Ze lay down inside it.\n\n*Squeak...*\n\nThe drawer was slowly pushed in, until it closed completely.\n\nQuiet.\n\nCold.\n\nSilent.\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids.\n\nSleepiness washed over him.\n\nHe had finally found the feeling of being able to sleep.\n\nBut he couldn't sleep just yet.\n\nBecause he didn't know...\n\n...who had just been standing outside and pushed the drawer shut for him.\n***\n¹ A vulgar Chinese folk saying.

    "content": "Zhou Ze began to kick outwards with his feet, trying to get himself out, but from the outside came the sound of *click-clack*, which meant the lock on the outside of the ice coffin had been fastened.\n\nHe was locked in. Couldn't get out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt as if he had returned to the scene of being placed in that cramped coffin.\n\nOnly, this time, Zhou Ze wasn't frantic, nor was he enraged. He simply reached up and knocked on the metal panel near his head:\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't think someone had come in to help push his ice coffin shut and then lock it, unless that person was a deranged lunatic, and Zhou Ze didn't believe his luck was *that* bad.\n\nBesides,\n\nHe had closed the morgue door after entering. A lunatic who knew the morgue's door code?\n\nWould you believe that?\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze could only assume that one of *those things* had \"helped\" him out, and done a very thorough job of it.\n\nHowever, after his one-word inquiry, it was still silent outside.\n\nZhou Ze decided to just ignore it, closed his eyes again, and prepared to get a good night's sleep.\n\nThis time, sleep came quickly.\n\nAfter all, he hadn't slept in two days, and a lot had happened in those two days. The accumulated fatigue was terrifying.\n\n*Even if the world ends in a flood after I die,*\n*no one is stopping me from sleeping right now.*\n\n...\n\nHe didn't know how long he had slept, but when Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he felt refreshed and invigorated. A long-lost sense of mental clarity had returned. Unfortunately, his body was also frozen stiff.\n\nThe stiffness of his body was somewhat terrifying. Zhou Ze tried his best to squirm within the narrow space, and a series of \"cracking\" sounds emanated, so comfortable that he couldn't help but let out a sound.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's ten fingernails naturally grew long and turned black, gleaming with an unnatural luster. The stiffness in his body and the chill within—unbearable for an ordinary person—were slowly gathering at his fingertips.\n\nThe entire process didn't last long, but it made Zhou Ze no longer feel cold or uncomfortable.\n\nHe subconsciously kicked with his feet again, and the ice coffin naturally slid out.\n\nThe lock…\n\nhad been undone?\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. He sat up on the steel slab, climbed down, and then pushed it back in.\n\nHis clothes were a bit stiff, hanging on him like cardboard, which felt extremely uncomfortable. Zhou Ze's gaze, meanwhile, was scanning the surroundings.\n\nThe affiliated hospital's morgue wasn't very large. Compared to those in the big city hospitals, it even seemed a bit \"demure,\" but it still stored a considerable number of bodies.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know who had helped push him in earlier, and trying to find them now would indeed be a bit difficult.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had undone the lock while he was sound asleep, Zhou Ze didn't intend to stir up more trouble here.\n\nHe walked toward the morgue entrance, planning to leave. However, as he passed by the gurneys covered with white sheets, Zhou Ze stopped.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about the bodies covered by the white sheets.\n\nIncluding the old woman wrapped in a floral-patterned family quilt—she also seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped.\n\nBecause he remembered that this old woman's head and feet were now in opposite positions.\n\nIt was impossible that the morgue attendant had come in while he was sleeping, done nothing else, and just flipped the old lady around.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside the old woman and said:\n\n\"If it was you, and you don't come out now, I'm leaving.\"\n\nThe old woman pushing him in and locking him up earlier might have been out of malice, but the fact that she had quietly undone the lock for him meant she didn't intend to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone had been about to come by, and seeing an unlocked drawer, they might have discovered him.\n\nAfter all, whether these drawers were locked or not was very obvious from the outside.\n\nAfter waiting for half a minute with no activity, Zhou Ze decided not to wait any longer.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze really disliked this feeling.\n\nSo hesitant.\n\nPlaying hard to get.\n\nShe was clearly an old woman when she died, yet she insisted on acting like a bashful young maiden.\n\nAlright, age discrimination was indeed wrong, but it was only human nature for a normal person's tolerance for a beautiful female ghost to be slightly higher.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian¹ had a face full of wrinkles and big yellow teeth, do you think Ning Caichen would still have had a human-ghost romance with her?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked behind him.\n\nAn old woman with a full head of silver hair was crouched there, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief that had been washed until it was faded.\n\nBut ghosts have no tears, so from Zhou Ze's perspective, it looked more like she was dry wailing.\n\n\"You carry on crying. I won't disturb you.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to leave.\n\nHe found that he was, after all, a common mortal. Even when it came to ghosts, he was a bit of a lookist.\n\n\"Help me. I have money,\" the old woman said suddenly.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze responded. He was short on cash.\n\nThe damned Xu Le had less than two hundred yuan combined in his Alipay and WeChat. Adding the one thousand one hundred sent back by the \"murderer,\" Zhou Ze's total assets were now less than one thousand three hundred.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's house and savings from his previous life had probably all been donated to an orphanage. He was basically destitute.\n\n\"My money is in a hidden compartment in my cabinet. It's an old, yellow-lacquered cabinet. There's thirty thousand yuan, and also the dowry from when I got married—a jade hairpin, a jade bracelet. I don't know how much they're worth.\n\nI died suddenly, before I had time to tell my sons. I'm afraid they won't know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"I'll take a cut.\"\n\nThe old woman's face showed a hint of struggle, but she still nodded. \"That's only right.\"\n\nThe old woman knew that without an \"anomaly\" like Zhou Ze to pass on the message, her sons would probably never find the assets she had left behind.\n\n...\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zhou Ze took a taxi directly to a place in Tongzhou District called \"Xingdong Town.\" It wasn't very far; Tongcheng's airport was located in this town.\n\nEarlier at the hospital, Zhou Ze had inquired at the registration desk. After the old woman was sent to the hospital, she died despite rescue efforts. Her family then abandoned the body at the hospital, leaving an unpaid medical bill.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived in the town and, following the old woman's description, found the village.\n\nIt was a self-built, two-story house. Attached to it was a small brick hut, similar to a rural outhouse.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived, he saw several workers demolishing a building—the brick hut, of course.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, handed a cigarette to one of the masters,² and asked, \"Still busy, with the New Year so close?\"\n\n\"Got to make more money before the New Year, right? We're all from the same village anyway,\" the mason replied casually.\n\n\"This house, what's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked while peering inside. Two workers were already taking off the roof, and the bricks from the small hut's walls were being removed to be reused later. As for the inside of the hut, forget the yellow-lacquered cabinet the old woman had mentioned; you couldn't even see a small stool. It was completely empty.\n\n\"His old ma died. This hut used to be where his ma lived alone. Now they're planning to tear it down and build a new kitchen.\" The master leaned his head over for Zhou Ze to light his cigarette, smiled a little sheepishly, and said, \"See, that one who just walked past in front is their eldest son.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man, whose hair was also turning white, had some bruises on his face.\n\n\"Five brothers. They got into a fight over the little bit of money their old ma left behind. These bricks, once they're taken down, the other four are gonna come and demand their share.\n\nYou tell me, this world, it's different now, huh? Their old ma's body is still at the hospital, they haven't even collected it. None of the brothers are willing to pay off the medical bills.\"\n\n\"What about the things in the old woman's hut?\" Zhou Ze was concerned about this. From the old woman's account, the thirty thousand yuan in the cabinet was her life savings, but the jade bracelet and hairpin were the truly valuable items. Selling them for a few hundred thousand should have been no problem.\n\n\"Sold 'em to the scrap collector. Cleared it out long ago. They sold it all off right when the old lady was first hospitalized.\" The master took another deep drag from his cigarette. \"I gotta get back to work.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. This trip of his had been a complete waste.\n\nNot only did he not get a share of what the old woman left, but even her sons didn't get to enjoy it. It had all gone to some junk dealer who collected old furniture.\n\nZhou Ze was now quite frustrated. Having no money was truly a huge problem. He was unwilling to use his abilities to swindle money—although it seemed very easy and satisfying—but after saving that girl last time, he had almost died from the pain last night. Heaven knew what other problems would arise if he kept messing around.\n\nWhether there were deities three feet above his head, Zhou Ze didn't know.\n\nBut if he kept digging three feet down, there was definitely a hell, because he had been there.\n\nHe knew he wasn't human, and this was the human world. Besides, he still had a fresh memory of how the patient who died in front of him had screamed in terror, \"I've been discovered!\"\n\nBut,\n\nMoney, ah.\n\nZhou Ze was willing to turn the millstone,³\n\nbut who would pay him?\n\nZhou Ze needed money now. Setting aside the matter of getting rid of his \"live-in son-in-law\" status,\n\nhe at least needed to buy himself an ice coffin or a large freezer, right?\n\nOtherwise, would he have to run to the hospital morgue every day to mooch off their cold air?\n\nFeeling somewhat dejected, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, feeling incredibly annoyed.\n\nJust then, the phone in his pocket rang. Zhou Ze picked it up. It was an unfamiliar number. He answered the call:\n\n\"Hello,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Big Bro, the goods arrived safely. When are you coming to inspect them? The cops are cracking down hard lately, this shipment wasn't easy to get in,\" the person on the other end said, lowering his voice cautiously.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nbut made no sound.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nthe image of Xu Le suddenly began to grow much taller in his mind.\n\n---\n¹ **Nie Xiaoqian and Ning Caichen**: Characters from a famous story in Pu Songling's *Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio*, popularized by the film *A Chinese Ghost Story*.

    "content": "Anxious, uneasy, with a hint of secret delight and confusion—that was probably how Zhou Ze felt on his taxi ride to the outskirts of Tongcheng.\n\nHe needed money, desperately. But he didn't need a fortune. A huge sum of money would be useless to him, at least for now.\n\nHaving died and come back to life, he had entanglements from his past life and troubles in his current one. He needed a sum of money to resolve them. After that, he would have to plan for the long term, not indulge in a life of extravagance.\n\nFor example, leaving the Lin family. Although Lin Wanqiu was beautiful and elegant, he really couldn't be bothered to go back to that house anymore. They'd never had any physical intimacy. He hadn't enjoyed any of the benefits, and it seemed that loser Xu Le hadn't either, so there was naturally no sense of owing her anything.\n\nSo saying \"bye-bye\" came with no psychological burden.\n\nBut leaving that house required some preparation. He needed a place to stay, and he also had to buy a freezer of slightly better quality. Zhou Ze didn't dare to hunt for a discarded freezer in a secondhand market. What if something went wrong while he was sleeping inside and he ended up killing himself? Wouldn't that be a colossal loss?\n\nMoney!\n\nEven being a ghost requires money.\n\nBut based on the phone call that person had made to Xu Le, Zhou Ze felt a growing trepidation. Xu Le, a modern-day live-in son-in-law, so pathetic he let his in-laws walk all over him, so pathetic he slept in a separate bed from his wife—turned out to be a hidden underworld boss?\n\nAlright, the clash of images was really exciting and very much in the style of an American TV show. The badass characters always have a seemingly ordinary real-life identity.\n\nLike Spider-Man being a high school student, or Superman being a newspaper reporter.\n\nSo, how should he handle this situation?\n\nHow to get rid of that gang?\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to \"taint\" this identity of his, because that would mean endless trouble. The police investigation in the real world was already more than Xu Le could easily handle, not to mention the people the old man and the faceless woman had shouted about, the ones who would \"find you and catch you.\"\n\nHe had a bit of a headache and felt a little out of his element, but Zhou Ze still arrived at the small, abandoned fertilizer plant.\n\nTwo men were squatting at the entrance to the plant. One wore a somewhat shabby military greatcoat, the other a cheap, poor-quality suit.\n\nBoth men were squatting there with cigarettes dangling from their lips, puffing away.\n\nZhou Ze paid the fare, got out of the car, and the two men immediately stood up and walked over to him.\n\n\"Our boss is waiting for you,\" the man in the military greatcoat said in a deep voice.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and followed the man in the greatcoat inside. The man in the suit remained squatting there, smoking, apparently acting as a lookout.\n\nAfter walking in, Zhou Ze saw a bald, fat man wearing a gold chain, sitting on a plastic chair and drinking by himself. When he saw Zhou Ze arrive, the fat man immediately stood up.\n\n\"Brother Xu, you're finally here.\"\n\nThe fat man was huge, about one-eighty-five,¹ and his gold chain was thick and gaudy. The gold dust rubbed onto his neck by the chain was even more so.\n\n\"Where's the merchandise?\"\n\nZhou Ze clasped his hands behind his back, his fingers interlocking slightly. There were only three people here. Taking them all down wouldn't be a big problem, but what would he do after? Hand them over to the police? Wouldn't that get him implicated too?\n\nDeal with them himself? Eliminate them in the name of the moon?² That didn't seem right either. Given his sensitive identity, if he killed people carelessly, it might trigger the same kind of backlash as saving people carelessly. He wasn't willing to try it lightly.\n\n\"Brother Xu is as straightforward as ever!\"\n\nThe fat man wiped his mouth, then reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched. He took a deep breath, forcing himself not to slap the fat man's greasy hand away.\n\n\"Come, this way!\"\n\nThe fat man made an inviting gesture, leading Zhou Ze to a small storeroom in the back courtyard.\n\nUpon entering,\n\nZhou Ze's pupils suddenly constricted.\n\nA pile of merchandise was stacked like a small mountain, covered with black oiled paper bags.\n\nZhou Ze had never done anything illegal before, but he knew that with this much merchandise, according to the law, it would be enough to get him shot several hundred times over. He could eat enough \"peanuts\"³ to make his stomach bloat.\n\n\"It's not just for Tongcheng, is it?\" What Zhou Ze really wanted to ask was, *Did you guys just rob a warlord in the Golden Triangle?*\n\n\"Of course not, Brother Xu. Tongcheng is still too small. This shipment will ultimately use Tongcheng as a springboard to flow into Shanghai.\" The fat man stretched. \"This time, let's hurry up and move the goods. We'll make a huge profit.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and touched his forehead, saying with difficulty, \"It'll be hard to move all of this in a short time, won't it?\"\n\nAfter all, it wasn't like selling cabbage, where you could just ride a tricycle around shouting through a megaphone.\n\n\"Don't you worry about that, Brother Xu. We just need to distribute this batch to the people below us. The profit won't be as high as selling it ourselves, but the key is speed and guaranteed sales. Once this batch is done, we'll go get another one,\" the fat man said nonchalantly.\n\n*Xu Le, oh, Xu Le, you even built up a drug trafficking network. You really are something else...*\n\nA big shot like this, actually got bludgeoned to death by that moron over three hundred yuan!\n\n\"Brother Xu, come take a look. See how the quality of this batch is.\"\n\nThe fat man lifted the oiled paper bags as he spoke.\n\nThen, a look of astonishment appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\n\nBecause what he saw wasn't a mountain of drugs, but stacks of books and discs.\n\n*Could it be hidden in the pages of the books?*\n\n\"Brother Xu, thanks to your classmate, getting this batch was a breeze. These discs are all popular movies still showing in theaters. I even made sure to copy a few adult films⁴ onto them. These pirated books and romance novels are also bestsellers on the market.\n\nAnd there's the 20-volume, two-million-word expanded sequel to *Bai Jie*⁵ that you specifically wrote, Brother Xu. Many of our downstream sellers have already pre-ordered this one. We won't have to worry about selling it.\"\n\n\"The merchandise you were talking about... is this stuff?\" Zhou Ze asked the fat man.\n\n\"Yeah?\" The fat man was taken aback for a moment. \"This is it.\"\n\nDisappointment.\n\nGreat disappointment.\n\nExtreme disappointment.\n\nAnd at the same time, he felt so ashamed.\n\nXu Le was still Xu Le, after all. To ensure these pirated goods sold well, he had actually written a sequel to the story of *Bai Jie* himself.\n\nAnd a two-million-word sequel at that.\n\nJust how much free time did he have...\n\n\"How much can I pull out?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I plan on quitting.\"\n\nIn a business partnership, there should be an initial capital investment.\n\n\"What? Brother Xu, you're planning to quit?\" the fat man said, surprised. \"We're just about to rake in the money, and you're quitting now?\"\n\n\"Yes. This business doesn't quite align with core values. I don't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze said this very seriously. He didn't want to take even the slightest risk, especially before he sorted out his current life. He didn't want to get drawn into any potential whirlpools.\n\n\"...\" The fat man.\n\n\"...\" The man in the military greatcoat.\n\n\"Brother Xu's principles are lofty. I admire that. In the initial phase, Brother Xu, you invested...\"\n\nThe fat man held up four fingers. \"Twenty thousand yuan.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand it is, then. Give me the money. From now on, this has nothing to do with me.\" Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to argue about it. Getting twenty thousand yuan would solve his immediate cash crunch.\n\n\"Alright, I have twenty thousand here.\" The fat man nodded and went to get the money.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze had twenty thousand yuan in his pocket and was in a ride-hailing car heading back to the city.\n\nHe didn't go back to the bookstore right away but went to an electronics market. He spent over ten thousand on a freezer. This type of freezer was generally used by businesses to store food and meat, and it was a higher-end model. Zhou Ze didn't hesitate to spend the money; after all, he'd be relying on it to sleep in from now on, and he was afraid a cheap one would have problems.\n\nThe merchant was very helpful and sent a small truck to deliver the freezer right to... the bookstore entrance.\n\nAfter the driver and Zhou Ze moved the freezer into the bookstore, the driver looked a bit stunned.\n\n\"Boss, you need a freezer for a bookstore?\" the driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed him a cigarette. \"Business is tough. I'm thinking of selling seafood on the side.\"\n\nThe driver took the cigarette and left. The delivery was made, and the rest wasn't his concern.\n\nThe bookstore had a small second-floor loft, which Xu Le had originally used to store extra books. Zhou Ze cleared it out and placed the freezer up there. Looking at his \"new bed,\" Zhou Ze finally felt a great sense of relief.\n\nComing down from the loft, Zhou Ze found someone in his bookstore. Not a customer, but his \"wife.\"\n\nDr. Lin was flipping through a magazine. Seeing Zhou Ze come down, she asked with some confusion, \"What were you busy with up there?\"\n\n\"Organizing my stock,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"I'm off work,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"Mm.\" *Getting off work doesn't mean you'll sleep with me...*\n\n\"That girl woke up.\" Dr. Lin looked pointedly at Zhou Ze. \"Her father wants to treat our department to dinner at the Tongcheng Grand Hotel. You should come too.\"\n\n\"What would I do there?\"\n\n\"After the girl woke up, she kept calling for 'Uncle',\" Dr. Lin said, looking at Zhou Ze curiously. \"Did you know her before?\"\n\n\"People can still perceive things even when they're unconscious, right?\" Zhou Ze continued to bullshit. \"She probably sensed it when I was saving her.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"I'm not going.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not hungry. I don't have any appetite at all.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded and didn't insist. She seemed ready to leave, but she stopped at the bookstore entrance. \"Are you coming home tonight?\"\n\nBack to the same old question.\n\n*If I go home, you won't sleep with me anyway...*\n\nSo, Zhou Ze answered decisively:\n\n\"Not tonight. I've been a bit busy lately.\"\n\nRight, even though business at the store was as cold as an iced latte.\n\nDr. Lin hesitated for a moment but didn't press him. She took her car keys out of her pocket, preparing to leave.\n\nJust then,\n\nWith a loud *clang*,\n\nDr. Lin turned around to see her \"husband\" sprawled over a bookshelf, sending books tumbling to the floor.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin immediately rushed over to check on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt his vision start to blur, unable to focus. His chest heaved, and his legs went soft, as if he'd stepped on cotton and completely lost his balance.\n\n\"Fainted from hunger...\"\n\nZhou Ze answered.\n\nHe...\n\n...hadn't eaten in days.\n\n—————————\n\nFive days since the book's release, we're second on the overall new book charts for this period!\n\nIn the supernatural category, besides the monthly ticket chart—which we can't be on since we're not a premium-tier book yet—we're number one on all the other charts!\n\nYesterday, second place in daily sales on Qidian!

    "content": "Next to the bookstore was a noodle shop. Business was only average, pretty much the same as Zhou Ze’s bookstore—so deserted you could catch sparrows at the door.\n\nThis was because the pedestrian street had originally been built around the periphery of a plaza, but the plaza itself was now \"defunct.\" Aside from a movie theater, all the other businesses had moved out or shut down. As a result, the entire plaza had become a desolate area where people rarely set foot.\n\nAt least here in Tongcheng, the symptoms of overzealous urban development were already showing. A few years ago, commercial centers had been planned and built with reckless abandon, but Tongcheng wasn't Shanghai, after all; it couldn't supply that much foot traffic.\n\nFortunately, the noodle shop could still do delivery, and business seemed to be pretty good. But obviously, no one was going to suddenly feel spiritually \"hungry\" and use a delivery app to order a few books to go home and chew on.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back in his chair, still a little dizzy. Doctor Lin sat across from him. She took out her own tissues, wiped a pair of chopsticks clean, and placed them in front of him.\n\nShe was meticulous and considerate, just as she had been when she let Xu Le sleep on the bed while she took the floor. But at the same time, she was very cold.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother asking if she was truly opposed to feudal arranged marriages or if she was just a lesbian. It was a pointless question. Zhou Ze himself had no interest in the baffling web of relationships Xu Le had left behind, nor did he feel any attachment to it.\n\n\"Are you sure you're alright?\" Doctor Lin asked again.\n\n\"It's a small problem, just a small problem.\" Zhou Ze was a doctor himself. He knew his issues with eating and sleeping were difficult to explain with modern medicine, let alone treat.\n\nFortunately, the sleeping problem had been sorted out. But this eating thing… what a headache.\n\nIf he didn't eat, he would pass out again like he just had. But eating… the mere thought of it made nausea well up inside him.\n\n\"If you don't have an appetite, have a bowl of sour plum juice first,\" the noodle shop owner said. He was around thirty, yet his face already bore some wrinkles. The burden of life seemed to be a heavy one.\n\n\"Sour plum juice, will that help?\" Zhou Ze asked, feeling helpless.\n\n\"It'll whet your appetite.\" The owner smiled, then called toward the back room, \"Honey, is the pickled vegetable noodle soup ready yet?\"\n\nThe owner walked into the back, and the sounds of a husband and wife talking could be heard.\n\nZhou Ze stared at the sour plum juice in front of him. He picked up a spoon, scooped up a mouthful, and swallowed. As soon as it went down, his expression changed.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Doctor Lin pulled out a napkin and held it to his chin.\n\nZhou Ze's face contorted as he clutched his stomach.\n\nThen he took a deep breath and said:\n\n\"That's really sour.\"\n\nYes, so sour his entire body felt like it was about to spasm, so sour it even overpowered the feeling of nausea.\n\n\"Here it is, the noodles are here.\" The proprietress came over carrying the soup, setting it down in front of Zhou Ze. \"You can't drink our sour plum juice that fast,\" she added.\n\nDoctor Lin glanced at the noodles and frowned slightly. \"These noodles… they're way too mushy.\"\n\nShe meant they had been cooked for too long and had lost their firmness, which would greatly affect the texture.\n\n\"Well… our noodles are just like that,\" the proprietress said, a look of embarrassment on her face.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand. Mushy or not, firm or not, it didn't matter to him right now. As long as he could get it down, that was enough. He needed energy. If he couldn't eat, his only option was to go to the hospital for a glucose drip.\n\nWith great solemnity, Zhou Ze lifted his head, feeling as dignified as a martyr heading to his death. Then he ducked his head down abruptly and poured the entire bowl of unbelievably sour plum juice into his mouth in one go.\n\n*Hiss…*\n\nThat sour kick…\n\nIt was like pouring sulfuric acid into his stomach.\n\nBut immediately after, Zhou Ze grabbed his chopsticks, picked up a wad of noodles, and shoved them into his mouth. He wolfed them down as ravenously as he possibly could. In five or six bites, the entire bowl of noodles was in his stomach. He then picked up the bowl and gulped down all the broth.\n\n*Phew…*\n\n*Clack!*\n\nZhou Ze set the empty noodle bowl down.\n\nHe let out a long breath. He’d eaten!\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze reached up and clutched his chest. The nausea, which had been suppressed by the sour plum juice, came rushing back. But the food was already in his stomach. Zhou Ze practically had to clamp his hands around his own throat to keep from throwing it all up.\n\nNot throwing up was a success.\n\nHe had finally,\n\nfinally,\n\neaten something.\n\nBeads of sweat had already formed on Zhou Ze’s forehead. He grabbed a napkin from the table and wiped his face.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nDoctor Lin and the proprietress were both staring, dumbfounded. The way Zhou Ze had just eaten was simply too horrifying.\n\n\"Heh heh, looks like you were really hungry. Want another bowl?\" the proprietress asked.\n\n\"No, no, that's enough,\" Zhou Ze declined.\n\n\"Alright then.\" The proprietress cleared away the bowl and chopsticks in front of Zhou Ze and called toward the back room, \"Hey, old man, get the dough for the afternoon ready. The delivery orders will be coming in soon.\"\n\nThe proprietress walked inside. Her figure couldn't be called graceful, merely average-looking, but the charm was in her heavy chest and her high, perky bottom, which added a special kind of allure that was surprisingly attractive.\n\n\"You like… that type?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\nShe had noticed Zhou Ze watching the proprietress until she disappeared into the back room.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze shook his head. *I like your type, but you won't let me sleep with you.*\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled by his own thoughts. The idea of \"not letting me sleep with her\" had been in his mind for a long time, almost becoming an obsession. He had to admit, Doctor Lin was truly beautiful, and young too.\n\nEven though she was Xu Le's wife,\n\neven though Zhou Ze had never married in his previous life,\n\nif he were being honest with himself,\n\nhe still wanted to sleep with her.\n\nIt was precisely because he couldn't that he was so fixated on it, so frequently thinking about it.\n\n\"Not going home?\" Doctor Lin asked again.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"Then I'm leaving.\" Doctor Lin stood up. \"Call me if you need anything.\"\n\nAfter all, he was her husband in name, even if there was no substance to their marriage.\n\n\"Alright,\" Zhou Ze nodded. *If I'd known you were this easy to talk to and so considerate, I really should have borrowed some money from you when I was broke.*\n\nDoctor Lin left, driving away in her Porsche Cayenne.\n\nZhou Ze, however, remained seated in the noodle shop. His bookstore was right next door. Even though he had finished his meal, he could still sit and chat for a bit; they were neighbors, after all.\n\nThe owner came out from the back room and handed Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n\"How much?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Don't be a stranger. I can afford to treat you to a bowl of noodles, brother.\" The owner waved his hand magnanimously. They were neighbors who saw each other all the time; no need to create distance over a bowl of noodles.\n\n\"Won't your wife scold you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She won't. She's just a woman, what does she know? It's not her place to talk,\" the owner said, his male chauvinism on full display.\n\nA man, regardless of his status at home, always had to put on a bit of a show in public. No one was willing to admit they were afraid of their wife, just like no one was willing to admit they couldn't perform in bed.\n\n\"Heh heh, your wife is very pretty,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nJoking about another man's wife was a taboo. If two men were facing outward, teasing some woman walking down the street, that would be considered playful banter between men.\n\nThe owner froze for a second but said nothing, just offering a small laugh. The owner had a good temper; people who ran small businesses usually understood that harmony brings wealth.\n\n\"Her figure is excellent,\" Zhou Ze continued. \"Sturdy, and full of flavor, just like the noodles I just ate.\"\n\nThe owner took a heavy drag from his cigarette.\n\n\"How is she in bed?\" Zhou Ze asked again, pushing his luck even further this time.\n\nThe owner's fists clenched slightly, but he quickly relaxed, saying nonchalantly, \"Those legs of hers… they could squeeze a man to death. So powerful!\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nThe owner smiled too.\n\n\"Can you handle it?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"She's at that age where she wants it, right?\"\n\nThe owner hammered his own lower back. \"Can't handle it anymore. I'm not a young man anymore.\"\n\n\"Then, how about you let me have a try?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe owner's face turned completely black.\n\nHis knuckles cracked as he squeezed his fists.\n\n\"If you can't do it, I can. I'm still young,\" Zhou Ze said, as if to himself. Though, that was a bit of a lie. Xu Le's physique, young as it was, had the feel of a silver spear with a wax tip; it wasn't nearly as well-maintained as Zhou Ze's own body from his previous life.\n\n\"Isn't this joke going a bit too far?\" The owner was still holding back his anger.\n\n\"What if your wife agrees?\" Zhou Ze pressed on.\n\n\"Was that your wife just now?\" the owner asked, changing the subject.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Would you be willing to give her up?\" the owner asked.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. Even though she was Xu Le's wife, she was now his in name. Zhou Ze was unwilling.\n\n\"Then what makes you think I'd be willing?\" the owner shot back.\n\n\"Maybe you have some special tastes, some unusual fetish? Things like that aren't so rare these days, are they?\"\n\n\"Brother, it's been a long time since I've hit anyone,\" the owner said, standing up.\n\n\"Call your wife out. Ask her. I want to hear her say whether she's willing or not.\" Zhou Ze leaned back slightly, smiling.\n\n\"Heh.\" The owner took a few steps closer to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You stand right there and call for her,\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"You're asking to die!\" The owner lunged forward.\n\n\"Can she even come out?\" Zhou Ze asked suddenly.\n\nThe owner froze.\n\nThen, a look of terror appeared on his face, and he stumbled back several steps in fear.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked toward the back room on his own. He lifted the curtain. The room was empty.\n\nExcept for a human skin, belonging to a woman,\n\nhanging on a clothes hanger.\n\nAs the curtain was lifted, a breeze entered,\n\ngently stirring it,\n\nmaking it sway slowly.\n\n\"How… did you figure it out?\" the owner asked, slowly approaching. His voice betrayed no emotion.\n\n\"There's a saying… 'Are you trying to fool a ghost?'\" Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the owner. \"Shouldn't you peel off that layer of skin you're wearing, too?\n\nI'm very curious,\n\njust how bored are you,\n\nto be here,\n\nputting on this kind of double act.\"",

    "content": "The owner smiled, not looking the least bit provoked. He just found it a little amusing.\n\nA person's disposition and aura are often more credible than their words.\n\n\"Riiip...\"\n\nA crisp, drawn-out sound, like a snake shedding its skin. He began to tear off his own skin.\n\nAt the same time, the owner's frame began to shrink, his physique slowly slimming down, like a balloon with a small hole slowly deflating.\n\nZhou Ze now finally understood why that bowl of noodles had been cooked so mushy.\n\nThis \"transformation\" of his did indeed take some time.\n\nHe was still wearing the owner's clothes and apron, but his face had become that of a somewhat green young man.\n\nThe young man wore a smile, his charm innate. The curve extending from the corners of his eyes, in particular, seemed capable of scratching that itch deep in the hearts of any man or woman nearby—just enough, and just right.\n\nDescribing a man with \"媚\"¹ was a bit incongruous, but some men were indeed born with a bewitching quality. Take ancient emperors, for example; countless among them favored male companions, precisely because some men were more womanly than women themselves.\n\n\"Am I good-looking?\" the young man asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt the nausea he had suppressed after eating the noodles surge up again. He waved a hand apologetically, then clutched his chest, striking a pose that said, *I can't throw up.*\n\nWho would know that every grain in the bowl comes from toil and hardship!²\n\nZhou Ze knew well to cherish his food, especially food he had struggled to swallow and was about to digest into energy.\n\nThe young man sat down on a nearby chair, casually fiddling with a lighter in his hand.\n\nHe was sizing up Zhou Ze, because Zhou Ze had seen through him. He had thought his imitation was seamless, especially in a small eatery like this; nothing should have gone wrong.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nhe was imitating his own mom and dad.\n\nHe had been observing them since he was young. Their every move, every subtle expression, was long since engraved in his heart.\n\n\"How did you find me out?\" the young man couldn't help but ask.\n\n\"You're not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked at the same time.\n\nThe young man frowned slightly. He thought Zhou Ze was mocking him, accusing him of playing pretend and acting mysterious.\n\nBut in reality, Zhou Ze had assumed he was a ghost from the very beginning.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to meddle in other people's business. As someone who, not long ago, was agonizing over the cost of a freezer, Zhou Ze didn't think he had the right to get involved.\n\nBut he couldn't just ignore this business, not when it was happening right next door.\n\nSo Zhou Ze figured it was best to just expose the situation first. If it was easy to solve, he'd solve it. If not, worst-case scenario, he'd just move again.\n\n\"Your fingernails,\" said Zhou Ze. \"I'm a bit sensitive about fingernails.\"\n\nThe proprietress had brought the noodles to him; the owner had personally handed him a cigarette.\n\nIn both instances, their fingernails were on full display.\n\nAlthough the fingers differed in thickness, fairness, and calluses, the ridges on the nails were identical.\n\nAnd recently, Zhou Ze had been paying extra attention to fingernails—not just his own, but other people's as well.\n\nThe young man's eyes narrowed slightly, a look of disappointment on his face. The details hadn't been good enough.\n\nAlthough he had been a bit careless, the fact that he was discovered was undeniably his own flaw.\n\n\"You're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nIf he was human, this was all a bit too incredible.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze hadn't seen many ghosts. Not counting his journey in Hell, the number of ghosts he had seen in the mortal realm could be counted on one hand.\n\n\"Skin-painting³ is my family's ancestral art.\" The young man stood up, took Zhou Ze's hand, and placed it on his chest. \"It's just that the line was broken for many generations. It wasn't until my generation that it could be picked up again.\"\n\nThe gesture was a bit ambiguous and overstepped boundaries, but Zhou Ze still squeezed subconsciously.\n\nZhou Ze would never admit that Dr. Lin's refusal to sleep with him had caused him to develop an interest in men.\n\nOf course, the man before him was indeed more bewitching than a woman. That was a fact.\n\n\"No bones?\" A look of surprise appeared on Zhou Ze's face. \"No, wait. It's osteomalacia.\"\n\nOsteomalacia, also known as rickets, is caused by a calcium deficiency that hinders bone calcification, making the bones soft and prone to deformation. Zhou Ze had been a doctor, so he knew a little about it. But just as a common cold has many variations and pathologies, osteomalacia also has many sub-categories, and the young man before him must be an extreme case.\n\nAccording to legend, unofficial histories from the Spring and Autumn Period record that a prince of the State of Lu suffered from this disease. It was as if he had no bones; his body was pliant, and he could walk like a man but also crawl like a snake.\n\n\"You can think of it as a genetic disease. It requires a certain probability to manifest. For many generations, my ancestors couldn't practice skin-painting because they didn't have this condition. But I...\"\n\nThe young man smiled and didn't continue.\n\n\"So, you're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze still wasn't convinced.\n\n\"My name is Xu Qinglang,\" the young man replied very seriously.\n\n\"And who were you imitating?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My dad and mom.\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment, a wry smile on his face.\n\nAlright then.\n\nThis was a huge misunderstanding.\n\nEarlier, after finishing the noodles and after \"Sister Lin\" had left, Zhou Ze had tried to expose him, deliberately provoking him. He never would have thought the guy was just bored and role-playing here to commemorate his deceased parents.\n\nBut from Zhou Ze's perspective, he had just naturally assumed this was a ghost, like the one from the \"Painted Skin\" story—a ghost who killed people, flayed them, and was now a monkey in a hat.⁴\n\n\"Well then... my apologies.\"\n\nJoking about your mom... I'm actually a little embarrassed.\n\n\"I'm not angry,\" said Xu Qinglang. \"But I'm very curious. What did you mean by constantly treating me like a ghost?\"\n\n\"It didn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"Have you seen a ghost?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I am a ghost,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Xu Qinglang very seriously.\n\nHis expression was solemn, his demeanor grave.\n\nHe was baring his soul.\n\nXu Qinglang's face froze.\n\nThen, he couldn't help but let out a \"Pfft\" of laughter.\n\nHe looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nas if he were looking at an idiot.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Sometimes, that's just how it is. You tell them the truth, and they think you're messing with them and don't believe you.\n\n\"Anyway, I'm sorry. Oh, right, I wanted to ask, were those skins real human skins?\" Zhou Ze asked curiously.\n\n\"Fish skin,\" Xu Qinglang replied. \"Processed, painted, and crafted.\"\n\n\"Then why are you selling noodles?\" Zhou Ze couldn't understand. \"I heard that snake skin clothes from the Hezhen people can sell for a lot of money, sold as art. Yours should be worth even more, right?\"\n\n\"I can't bring myself to profit from an ancestral heirloom.\"\n\n\"Then you must be very rich,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"My family's property was just part of a demolition and relocation project,\" Xu Qinglang answered indirectly. \"We were given over twenty apartments.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nSo, this was how unfair the world was. In his previous life, he had worked his fingers to the bone at the hospital and barely earned anything, while this guy just casually ended up with over twenty apartments.\n\nTongcheng wasn't Shanghai, but property prices were still close to ten thousand yuan per square meter.\n\nA second-generation rich-from-demolition. I'm so jealous.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Are you going to keep making noodles in the future?\"\n\n\"Are you going to keep selling books in the future?\"\n\nThe two asked each other the same question at the same time.\n\n\"I'll see how it goes for now,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Same here.\"\n\n\"Well, see you around. By the way, does your plum juice come in any other flavors?\" Zhou Ze was curious about this. \"Like bitter melon? Or grape?\"\n\n\"I have secret recipes. I can make them,\" Xu Qinglang said honestly.\n\n\"Excellent.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\n*Damn,*\n\n*it's like cotton,*\n\n*so soft. He's really boneless and pliable. If I were to hold him in my arms in bed...*\n\nZhou Ze immediately pictured Dr. Lin emerging from the shower in her pajamas, forcefully suppressing his inappropriate thoughts.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the noodle shop.\n\nXu Qinglang went into the back room, lifted the curtain, and said to the woman's skin hanging inside:\n\n\"Mom, do you think he really believed me, or was he just pretending?\"\n\nThe woman's skin swayed gently,\n\nrocking slightly,\n\nas if to say, *He didn't believe you,*\n\nand also as if to say, *She didn't know.*\n\n..............\n\nZhou Ze returned to his shop. The freezer was installed. The next step was to overhaul the broken-down bookstore Xu Le had left behind. Letting it continue to lose money wasn't a solution.\n\nThe sign on the bookstore's entrance read \"Xu Le's Reading Nook,\" and it was as tacky as it gets.\n\nIn short, in that guy's hands, the bookstore, from top to bottom, inside and out, simply oozed an aura of \"guaranteed to lose money.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down at the computer and tried several times to log into his original QQ account, but he couldn't get in. He couldn't pass the identity verification, and an appeal was basically impossible.\n\nAfterwards, Zhou Ze had no choice but to go out and hail a cab. He planned to get a new sign, or maybe a set of couplets for the doorway.\n\nHe knew someone who ran a plaque shop, specializing in carved wooden signs. The owner was an old man who often donated to the local orphanage. Back when Zhou Ze himself was a member of that orphanage, the old man was already donating. After Zhou Ze started working, he and the old man donated alongside each other.\n\nThe plaque shop wasn't far, located at the foot of Langshan Mountain. It was surrounded on all sides by shops selling incense and candles; only this one sold plaques.\n\nBut when Zhou Ze walked in, he found the shop undergoing a major clean-out. Even the main sign had been taken down.\n\nA middle-aged man was there, directing workers.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" he asked upon seeing Zhou Ze approach.\n\n\"I'm looking for Old Mr. Zhao,\" Zhou Ze said. He held the old man in high regard.\n\n\"I'm sorry, my father passed away last month,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"Passed away?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised and saddened. He and Old Zhao weren't actually close, they just knew of each other. So it was perfectly normal that he hadn't been notified of the funeral.\n\nBesides, for Old Zhao's family, the fact that he constantly donated the plaque shop's income to the orphanage probably meant they didn't have a very favorable impression of the place. They might not have even notified the orphanage of the funeral, afraid they'd show up asking for money.\n\n\"Are you here to order a plaque?\" the middle-aged man asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Our family isn't in that business anymore,\" the man said apologetically. \"From now on, we're selling incense and candles.\"\n\nLangshan Mountain was one of the Ten Minor Buddhist Mountains. Even if it didn't attract tourists from afar, the locals who came to burn incense and pray on holidays were enough to let the shops at the foot of the mountain make a hefty profit.\n\nThis too was a form of living off the land—or in this case, living off the mountain.\n\n\"That's a shame,\" Zhou Ze said with some regret.\n\nHe decided he would go visit the old man's gravestone.\n\n\"But we still have a few plaques my dad made a while ago,\" the middle-aged man said, intending to get rid of them like scrap. \"They never sold. I don't even know why my dad carved them, they weren't custom orders. If you like any of them, I can sell them to you cheap.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll take a look,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nHe followed the middle-aged man into the small courtyard out back. The man unlocked a storage room and turned on the light.\n\nInside were various odds and ends, including Old Mr. Zhao's tools, all piled up haphazardly, a clear sign that his descendants had no intention of carrying on the craft.\n\nNowadays, everyone wanted illuminated signs. Who would want these? It was hard work and didn't even make much money.\n\n\"Phew...\" The middle-aged man blew a puff of air at the plaques on the floor. \"Take a look. Two hundred yuan each. If you see one you like, you can take it. If not, no big deal.\"\n\nClearly, the man wasn't very confident he could sell any of them.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and looked.\n\nThe first plaque read:\n\n\"Life and death are decreed by fate, riches and honor are determined by Heaven.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. The middle-aged man sighed, knowing that one was a no-go.\n\nThe next one read:\n\n\"Men know the terror of ghosts, but ghosts understand the poison in human hearts.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, slightly taken aback. This one resonated with him.\n\nThis time, the middle-aged man didn't sigh, because he knew it was a lost cause from the start. What kind of business owner had nothing better to do than hang something like that by their entrance?\n\nThe third:\n\n\"Listen with skepticism; thus have I heard.\"⁵\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze smile, the middle-aged man smiled too.\n\nAt least one of them was satisfactory.\n***\n¹ 媚 (mèi) describes a type of charm that is alluring, coy, and even seductive. It is almost exclusively used for women, so applying it to a man emphasizes his effeminate and bewitching nature.\n² A famous line from the Tang dynasty poem \"Sympathy for the Peasants,\" emphasizing the importance of not wasting food.\n³ 畫皮 (Huàpí), literally \"Painted Skin,\" is the title of a famous supernatural tale from the classic collection *Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio*. It tells of a demon who wears a painted human skin to disguise itself.\n⁴ 沐猴而冠 (mù hóu ér guàn), literally \"a monkey wearing a hat,\" is an idiom for a worthless person pretending to be a gentleman; a pretender unfit for their position.\n⁵ A phrase combining a classical idiom and a Buddhist term. \"姑妄聽之\" (gū wàng tīng zhī) means to listen with doubt or take something with a grain of salt. \"如是我聞\" (rú shì wǒ wén) is the standard opening of Buddhist sutras, meaning \"Thus have I heard,\" a statement of faithfully recounting what was said.",

    "content": "Having brought the plaques back, Zhou Ze planned to hang one on each side of the entrance. He didn't much care which went on the left and which on the right.\n\nThe young man next door, Xu Qinglang, was very enthusiastic.\n\nHe had been squatting at his doorway peeling garlic, but when he saw Zhou Ze getting ready to hang the plaques, he went straight into his own shop and brought out a hammer and nails.\n\nZhou Ze said thanks. As he took the hammer, he noted it felt a bit greasy and heavy. Suppressing a slight sense of discomfort, Zhou Ze went ahead and nailed up the two plaques.\n\nAfterward, the two of them stepped back a few paces and looked at the plaques, at the door, at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze offered Xu Qinglang a cigarette as thanks. Xu Qinglang lit it for him.\n\nThey both exhaled rings of smoke together, in perfect sync.\n\n\"Sets the mood, don't you think?\" Zhou Ze said, a classic case of tooting his own horn.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"If I'm not mistaken, those two lines are from the chapter titles of Ji Yun's *Notes from the Thatched Abode of Close Examination*.\"\n\n*Notes from the Thatched Abode of Close Examination* is a collection of stories written by Ji Yun, also known as Ji Xiaolan, similar to *Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio*. It uses tales of fox spirits, ghosts, and monsters to express the author's own ideas.\n\nTo put it simply, the meaning of this couplet is: these are all just stories I've heard; everyone here, just listen to them for what they are.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Still too artsy. This shop of yours is still going to lose money.\" Xu Qinglang's assessment was blunt.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There are too many stories in this world. All sorts of bizarre things happen every day, but not many of them are genuinely interesting.\n\nSome stories are boring to tell.\n\nSome stories, you're not allowed to tell at all.\n\nSome stories, no one will listen to unless you change them.\n\nSome stories, people wouldn't dare listen to unless you change them.\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at Xu Qinglang for a good long while.\n\nXu Qinglang lowered his head slightly, a blush creeping onto his face.\n\nHe was a man who naturally exuded a flirtatious charm, and at this moment, he was devastatingly gorgeous.\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze wasn't speaking, Xu Qinglang continued:\n\n\"Take these things like mountain sprites, fox spirits, and ghosts, for example. Where would you really find them in the real world?\" Xu Qinglang yawned. \"And the morals you try to teach using made-up stories—how true can they really be?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to stare at Xu Qinglang, silent.\n\nThe staring was starting to make Xu Qinglang's skin crawl.\n\nBut Zhou Ze just kept looking at him.\n\nFinally, Xu Qinglang waved his hands dismissively, saying he had to get back to making his soup base. As he walked back to the noodle shop, he felt a prickling on his back. Just now, it had felt as if Zhou Ze wasn't looking at *him*, but at a joke.\n\nZhou Ze paid Xu Qinglang no mind. Since they were neighbors, they could just live and let live.¹ It's not like they were competitors, and most importantly, Zhou Ze had no money to move his shop.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze sorted through most of the textbooks and study guides in the bookstore and sold them for scrap paper prices to a recycler.\n\nHe then went to a supermarket and bought ten small plastic chairs. The only two remaining bookshelves held books that Zhou Ze himself found at least somewhat interesting.\n\nAt this point, it was less a bookstore and more a recreation center for the elderly.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He wasn't very good at running a business; right now, he was just messing around blindly. Besides, the shop was constantly losing money when Xu Le was around, so he didn't feel any pressure.\n\nGoing up to the small loft, Zhou Ze plugged in the freezer and set a temperature. He went outside for a smoke and waited a bit, then reached into the freezer to feel it.\n\nThe temperature was about right. Zhou Ze lay down inside.\n\nThe freezer, which had cost over ten thousand yuan, naturally had many functions, including a timer that served as Zhou Ze's alarm clock.\n\nHe closed the freezer lid.\n\nZhou Ze placed his hands on his abdomen and lay perfectly straight.\n\nHe looked... like he had passed away peacefully.\n\n...\n\nLate at night, a red sedan pulled over on the street in front of the bookstore. The whole street was somewhat deserted; on that side, only the adjacent noodle shop and bookstore still had their lights on.\n\nInside the car sat a well-dressed girl in a black down jacket, with shoulder-length hair. She looked cute and delicate.\n\n\"Xiao Bai, you bastard! I prepared for three days, and today you tell me you're away on a business trip? You can go to hell! Get lost!\"\n\nThe girl hung up the phone, fuming in the driver's seat.\n\nThe Corgi in the passenger seat jumped onto the girl's lap. Its fur was glossy and lustrous, clear evidence of a good pedigree and attentive care.\n\n\"It's okay, at least I still have you with me.\"\n\nThe girl lit a cigarette, stuck her hand out the window to flick the ash, and her gaze drifted outside. She saw the bookstore and, through the glass window, noticed its unusual setup—not many bookshelves, but rows of plastic stools instead.\n\nGetting out of the car, the girl carried her Corgi and walked towards the bookstore. She didn't want to drive around aimlessly on Valentine's Night. She wanted to find a quiet place to sit for a while.\n\nThe bookstore door was unlocked. Stepping inside, she could feel the warm air from the heater.\n\nThe girl, leading her dog, first picked a random magazine from a shelf, then sat down on one of the plastic chairs.\n\nShe let the Corgi off its leash, and the little guy began to \"explore\" the shop.\n\nAfter finishing the magazine, the girl stretched lightly. Feeling a bit thirsty, she called out:\n\n\"Boss, are you here? Do you have milk tea or coffee?\"\n\nThe girl stood up, put the magazine back, and chose an illustrated edition of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. After sitting back down, she couldn't help but call out again:\n\n\"Boss, what are you, dead? Is this any way to run a business in the middle of the night?\"\n\nA small sign on the glass door read \"Now Open, Welcome,\" the door was unlocked, and the heat was on. The shop was clearly still in business.\n\nIf the girl had been a little less polite or a little more curious at that moment and had gone up to the second floor to take a look, she might have been impressed by her own unwitting prophecy.\n\nIn the cramped space of the loft, there was indeed a freezer coffin.\n\nThe owner was lying inside, looking for all the world like a dead man.\n\nNo, the owner *was* a dead man.\n\nOf course, the girl would probably have been scared out of her wits long before she had a chance to be impressed with herself.\n\nA normal person entering a shop late at night only to find the owner lying in a freezer—pretty terrifying, right?\n\nThe girl lit another cigarette, growing impatient, and started playing on her phone.\n\nJust then, the sound of footsteps came from the stairwell. Zhou Ze hadn't woken up to the girl's shouts; he had woken up naturally.\n\nAs soon as he got to the bottom of the stairs, a small yellow figure darted towards his legs, asking to be held.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and bent down to scoop the Corgi into his arms. The little fellow wasn't shy at all, acting familiar with everyone.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze notice the woman sitting in his shop.\n\nOh, the first customer since he took over.\n\nBut he didn't feel as excited as he might have imagined. After all, he'd only changed the sign and cleaned up the interior today.\n\nHe still hadn't figured out how to make money.\n\n\"Do you have coffee here, boss?\" the girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at a water dispenser in the corner, which had a stack of disposable paper cups next to it.\n\nThe girl looked a bit exasperated, but she got up, poured herself a glass of water, and returned to her plastic stool.\n\nThe owner and the customer, they looked at each other without a word.\n\nAfter about half an hour of silence, the girl started scrolling through Weibo and watching videos. One video was particularly loud and boisterous:\n\n\"Step right up, don't miss out!\n\nSpirit money, blessed by yours truly, limited supply!\n\nYou can burn it now and withdraw it yourself when you get down there, and you'll even earn some interest—higher interest than Yu'e Bao!²\n\nYou can also burn it for your relatives down below. Fast and convenient, honest to all, no interference from ghost bailiffs, and no layers of commission skimmed off the top!\"\n\nThe girl laughed when she saw the video. People often have an instinctive urge to share something funny. She looked up at the owner sitting behind the counter and said:\n\n\"Boss, have you seen this video? This old Taoist's livestream is pretty famous. He's practically an internet celebrity.\"\n\n\"Oh, a livestream?\" Zhou Ze was a bit puzzled. He took out his phone. Xu Le's phone had a ton of livestreaming apps; seems the guy was really bored in his spare time, either watching streams or writing sequels to *Bai Jie*.³\n\n\"Yeah, search for his ID. It's hilarious. I think he runs a spirit money shop in Rongcheng, but he hasn't streamed in a long time.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened an app and searched for the old Taoist's ID as the girl suggested. It brought up a stream room—*Host is not home*.\n\nFortunately, he could still watch past broadcasts. Zhou Ze randomly clicked on a video from a month ago.\n\nIn the video, the old Taoist had his phone fixed in one position while he practiced martial arts, his punches creating a nice gust of wind. You could tell he was a practitioner. In the frame, a young man sat there with a faint smile, his eyes narrowed as if he were watching a monkey show.\n\nZhou Ze casually scrubbed through the video. Another man appeared in the frame, sitting behind the counter, holding a spoon as if he were eating porridge.\n\nThe old Taoist was front and center, talking nonstop, promoting himself and the spirit money he sold on Taobao, but Zhou Ze's gaze was unconsciously drawn to the man in the corner of the video.\n\nHe was frowning, he was in agony, he was in pain, he was fighting it.\n\nOne spoonful of porridge... he ate it with great difficulty.\n\nThen a second spoonful... as if he were being tortured.\n\nWatching this, Zhou Ze took a deep breath, as if he had been infected by the man in the corner of the screen.\n\nEating... was truly not an easy thing to do.\n\nHe didn't know the identity of the man in the video, but he instinctively felt a flicker of interest. Was the man an anorexia patient? Or did he have some kind of gastrointestinal disease?\n\nAfter the video ended, Zhou Ze opened the page and, on a whim, used Xu Le's logged-in account to send the old Taoist a private message:\n\n\"Who was that man sitting in the back drinking porridge in the video?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm leaving. How much do I owe you?\" The girl stood up and stretched. \"If I told anyone I spent Valentine's Night sitting in a bookstore reading *Dream of the Red Chamber* for hours, they'd think I was an idiot.\"\n\n\"Just pay whatever you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe customer had only read for a while and poured herself a glass of plain water.\n\nThe girl glanced at Zhou Ze. \"Boss, that's a good line. You're like those masters at the temple who interpret fortune sticks. The sign by the prayer cushion says 'Free Fortune Readings,' but after the tourist gets their fortune and you've interpreted it, you pull out a red donation book filled with a long list of names and offerings, and the smallest amount is a hundred.\"\n\nZhou Ze just smiled, neither confirming nor denying.\n\nThe girl took out a hundred-yuan bill and placed it on the chair she had been sitting on. Then, holding her Corgi, she pushed open the bookstore door and left.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, picked up the hundred-yuan bill, and flicked it with his finger.\n\nA crisp snap.\n\nIt was one of the most beautiful sounds in the world.\n\nWhen he walked back to the counter, Zhou Ze saw his phone screen light up. He opened it and found a reply. It was a private message from the old Taoist. The reply was very simple:\n\n\"He's gone!\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Live and let live**: The original Chinese is `井水不犯河水` (jǐng shuǐ bù fàn hé shuǐ), an idiom meaning \"well water does not interfere with river water.\" It signifies minding one's own business and staying out of each other's affairs.\n2.  **Yu'e Bao**: A popular money-market fund integrated into Alipay, China's largest mobile payment platform. It's known for offering slightly higher interest rates than standard bank savings accounts.\n3.  ***Bai Jie***: A reference to a well-known piece of Chinese erotic literature. The joke is that the previous owner was either watching streams or writing porn.",

    "content": "All night, there had only been one customer. The total income was a hundred yuan, but the cost was only a glass of water.\n\nOf course, you could say there were also costs like electricity and rent...\n\nBut that’s not how you should look at it. When Xu Le was around, those were also costs, but his income was practically negligible. One has to find the right point of comparison to feel a bit of satisfaction and confidence in life.\n\nAlso, it was because of that girl with the corgi that Zhou Ze realized it was actually Valentine's Day.\n\nHe scrolled through WeChat, found Dr. Lin's contact, and tapped on it. Zhou Ze wanted to send her a red envelope. He tried to send 1314 but found he didn't have enough money. He had enough for 131.4, but sending that amount felt a bit stingy.\n\n*She won't sleep with me anyway.*\n\n*Forget it.*\n\n*Not sending it.*\n\nTossing his phone aside, Zhou Ze grabbed a random book and flipped through it, holding that pose until morning.\n\nHe went next door for wontons. Whether the wrappers were thin or the filling was generous, Zhou Ze couldn't tell. He ate the same way as before: gulping down a large bowl of sour plum juice, then immediately wolfing down the food, all while clutching his throat and taking several deep breaths to suppress the urge to vomit.\n\nThe thought that every meal from now on would be this whole ordeal made Zhou Ze feel as if a shadow had been cast over his future.\n\nZhou Ze thought of the man in the video, also drinking congee in agony. He felt a wave of miserable kinship. Eating was supposed to be one of life's greatest pleasures, but now, it was lost to them.\n\nHe wondered if there was an \"Anorexics' Club\" somewhere in the world, where everyone would gather around a table, and whoever managed to eat a bite of food first would get a collective thumbs-up from the rest:\n\n\"You're so amazing!\n\nMy little XXX is so awesome!\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. The image was somewhat chilling.\n\nIn any case, yesterday's video, including the old Taoist priest and the man drinking congee, felt too distant for Zhou Ze for the time being.\n\nAfter Valentine's Day came New Year's Eve. Normally, this commercial center would be festooned with lanterns and decorations, brimming with a \"New Year's vibe,\" but in reality, it remained as it always was: cold and deserted.\n\nIt was just like life.\n\nWhere there is glory, there will naturally be desolation.\n\nZhou Ze remembered when this commercial center first opened; its popularity was unrivaled for a time. Now, it was completely ignored.\n\nXu Qilang's business was booming today, likely because many other shops were closed. Since he insisted on offering takeout even on New Year's Eve, he naturally got more orders. After all, the customers had fewer options.\n\nDelivery drivers in blue, yellow, or red uniforms bustled in and out of his noodle shop. Zhou Ze squatted at the entrance of his own bookstore, smoking a cigarette and sighing with emotion.\n\n*Goddamn Xu Le, it would have been so much better if you'd opened a braised chicken place.*\n\nImmortals in myths loved to say, \"A day in heaven is a year on earth.\"\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze felt this was probably right, and it applied equally to hell.\n\nHe remembered when he died in the car crash... no, wait, he remembered when he was sent into the incinerator, it was right around Children's Day on June 1st. And now, in the blink of an eye, it was New Year's Eve.\n\nMore than half a year had passed so quickly. Life is but a fleeting dream, just a dazed stumble down the road to the underworld.\n\nAfter many cigarettes and many thoughts, Zhou Ze felt a bit tired. He took out his phone, wanting to see what movies were playing recently. The cinema was right next door, so he could go there to kill some time.\n\n\"Hey, you got any newspapers over there?\" Xu Qilang asked, stepping out after sending off the last batch of delivery drivers.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To wallpaper the walls.\" Xu Qilang replied.\n\n\"That frugal?\"\n\n\"Newspaper wallpaper gives it atmosphere, a sense of an era. You didn't sell them all yesterday, did you?\"\n\n\"There are still some left. Wait, I'll go get them for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze went back into the shop, lugged a half-man-high stack of newspapers out of a box on the second floor near his freezer, and brought it downstairs to Xu Qilang, who was waiting.\n\n\"You're not going home for the New Year either?\" Xu Qilang asked.\n\n\"I'm spending the New Year with my books.\"\n\nIt was a shame Zhou Ze didn't have a goatee and a cup of wine in hand, or else he would have had to down a large cup to toast that incredibly cool-sounding line.\n\n\"You didn't go home either, did you?\" Zhou Ze asked after reveling in his own coolness for a moment.\n\n\"With over twenty properties, which home am I supposed to go back to?\" Xu Qilang sighed.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two were silent for a moment, then Zhou Ze spoke up: \"Let me tell you a story.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Xu Qilang nodded, his expression a little reserved. His hair was a bit long, and a few strands drooped towards the corner of his mouth. He reached up and gently brushed them away. He truly looked bashful and lovely.\n\nA charm not meant for outsiders to behold.\n\n\"Once, also on New Year's Eve, a man on a late-night road ran into the richest man in town.\n\nThe rich man was completely drunk.\n\nThe man asked the rich man, 'Why don't you go home?'\n\nThe rich man replied, 'Home? Where is my home? My family and relatives aren't by my side. The home you speak of, is it that mansion of mine, the largest in the city?'\"\n\nXu Qilang listened to the story and nodded slightly, as if in deep sympathy.\n\n\"Then that man pinned the rich man to the ground and beat him savagely, yelling:\n\n'Take that, you pretentious bastard, showing off on New Year's Eve!'\"\n\nZhou Ze finished the story.\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qilang.\n\nTheir conversation ended.\n\nZhou Ze went back into his bookstore. The heat was on, making it warm and cozy. He fiddled with his phone, with no one to contact.\n\nHe had thought about visiting the orphanage, but then decided against it. He didn't have much money left.\n\nBut just then, a customer arrived. It was a young man in blue work clothes and a safety helmet. He pushed open the bookstore door and walked in, asking timidly:\n\n\"Can I... read books here? How much is it?\" The man pursed his lips.\n\n\"Go ahead. Pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand, indicating he could browse freely.\n\n\"That's great. Do you have any novels?\" the young man asked, a bit self-consciously. \"I like reading novels, the web novel kind.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a box behind a bookshelf. \"They're all in there.\"\n\nThe man walked over to the box and rummaged through it, looking very happy. Some of the books were still shrink-wrapped.\n\n\"Go ahead and open them. No charge,\" Zhou Ze said magnanimously.\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nThe young man unwrapped a web novel, sat down on a plastic stool, and began to read.\n\nAs the owner, Zhou Ze sat behind the counter, trimming his nails. The young man sat there reading. About half an hour later, the young man stood up, took out his cigarettes, and offered one to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"It's not a good brand, hope you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Hey, cigarettes are no good to begin with, no need to distinguish between good and bad.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette. The man took one for himself and proactively went to the shop's entrance to light up while standing in the cold wind.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze, who had been planning to smoke inside, pause for a moment. He thought about it, then decided against it, putting the cigarette aside and continuing to trim his nails.\n\nAfter finishing his cigarette outside, the young man came back in. This time, he didn't sit on the plastic stool but sat on the floor, leaning against the wall.\n\nEven with the air conditioner on, the floor tiles were still cold, but the young man didn't seem to mind at all, likely used to it from his daily life.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, four more men in cleanly starched blue work clothes walked up to the shop. The oldest looked to be under thirty, and the youngest was maybe only seventeen.\n\nThe four of them came in together. The young man leaning against the wall waved at them; he must have been the one who called them over.\n\nThe newcomers greeted Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze gave a perfunctory reply and went back to trimming his nails.\n\nZhou Ze decided he needed to buy a professional manicure set. His nails deserved it.\n\nBut with deliveries suspended and most physical stores closed, he had to put the thought on hold for now.\n\nWhen he looked up again, Zhou Ze saw that all five workers were sitting on the floor, each holding a novel.\n\nFrom the covers, he could tell they were all web novels, mostly of the fantasy genre. One was holding a horror novel, biting his nails as he read, clearly engrossed.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze found the nail-biting behavior hard to condone.\n\n*Only those who know how to cherish their nails know how to cherish life.*\n\nFrom time to time, someone would laugh while reading, a genuine laugh from the heart inspired by the story.\n\nThe bookstore was full of people, but it was quiet. There were occasional small sounds, but they weren't disturbing.\n\nWhen evening came, Xu Qilang walked in carrying a bowl of dumplings. As soon as he entered, he said:\n\n\"Well, well, the shop's quite lively.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Hey fellas, want something to eat?\" Xu Qilang asked the workers sitting in the shop.\n\nThey looked at each other, a bit at a loss.\n\n\"Forget it, it's my treat.\" Xu Qilang was, after all, a man with over twenty properties. \"It's New Year's Eve, and it's not easy for you guys not to be home. We're all out here trying to make a living. We're all brothers, no matter where we're from.\"\n\n\"Well then, thank you, boss. May you get rich,\" said the oldest worker, standing up to thank Xu Qilang.\n\n\"It's what I should do, what I should do.\"\n\nXu Qilang put Zhou Ze's dumplings down and went back to his own shop.\n\nZhou Ze drank a little of the broth, then forced down two dumplings. That damn Xu Qilang had forgotten to bring him sour plum juice, so he couldn't eat much.\n\nTaking out the cigarettes on the counter, Zhou Ze walked out from behind it.\n\n\"Help yourselves to another when you're done. I should have the full sets of whatever I have here. Anyway, this shop is a money-losing business, so don't be polite with me.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed out cigarettes one by one.\n\nThe workers accepted them, one after another, as if receiving a great honor.\n\nThen they all got up, walked to the shop entrance together, and squatted in a row to smoke.\n\nThey were unwilling to dirty the environment inside the shop.\n\nZhou Ze thought for a moment, then also walked outside the shop. The wind was a bit cold. He squatted down next to them and smoked along.\n\nThe workers chatted.\n\nThe married ones talked about their wives and kids at home.\n\nThe unmarried ones talked about the girls they knew in Tongcheng or back in their hometowns.\n\nThey joked with each other.\n\nThey teased each other.\n\nEven though they all knew each other's stories,\n\nthey still had things to talk about.\n\nJudging by their accents, this group of workers was from all over the country, not from the same village.\n\nTongcheng was near Shanghai, part of the Yangtze River Delta. Although it couldn't compare to Shanghai in scale, the demand for labor here was still huge every year. As long as you were willing to work hard, you wouldn't have trouble finding a job or making money.\n\nThey passed around cigarettes for two more rounds.\n\nZhou Ze spoke up, \"Fellas, are you really not going home to see your families for the New Year?\"\n\n\"Nope. Everyone at home is fine.\"\n\n\"It's a lot of trouble to go back and forth. There's still work during the first month of the lunar year, and the boss will even give out red envelopes. It'd be a waste not to take them, and we can send more money home.\"\n\n\"Haha, today's been great. We've got novels to read and cigarettes to smoke. This New Year has some flavor to it.\"\n\n\"Boss, when are you closing?\" one of the workers asked.\n\n\"I'm not closing,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"The boss isn't going home?\"\n\n\"The missus at home won't listen to me, so I'm not going back.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a surge of heroic spirit soaring to the heavens!\n\nAll the workers gave Zhou Ze a thumbs-up, cheering for him.\n\nOf course, no one pressed the issue. They could tell from his accent, and since he ran a bookstore instead of a fruit stand, the workers guessed that Zhou Ze was a local.\n\nFor a local to stay at his shop on New Year's Eve instead of going home, there must be a reason. So, none of them continued to joke or tease him about it.\n\nBesides, they were each the pillars of their own families, out here working to earn money. Their wives were managing the elderly and children back home. They worked hard, they were tired, but their wives were too.\n\nLife is built on generations of hardship and endurance. Whose life is ever easy?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to pass out more cigarettes, a voice called out from a distance:\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and stood up. Only then did he notice a Porsche Cayenne parked on the opposite side of the road. A familiar car.\n\nAh, his wife's car.\n\nThe one yelling was his sister-in-law. She had indeed been terrified by Zhou Ze in the bathroom a while back, but she was back to normal now. She couldn't possibly believe her brother-in-law was a ghost, so she had just attributed it to her eyes playing tricks on her in her fear.\n\nOf course, she couldn't possibly have a good attitude towards Zhou Ze. After all, he had scared her so badly she'd wet herself. How embarrassing!\n\n\"Xu Le, come home for dinner!\" the sister-in-law shouted.\n\n\"Not going back. The shop's busy, and it's quite lively here,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave.\n\n*What a joke.*\n\n*Go back on New Year's Eve to see that pair of坑爹(kēngdiē)[^1] in-laws again?*\n\n*Put up with this bratty sister-in-law's attitude?*\n\n*And most importantly,*\n\n*Rush home on New Year's Eve just to sleep in separate beds?*\n\n*Am I a masochist?*\n\n\"Sis, is this guy insane? He's unreasonable, just plain weird, and so stubborn!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law pouted from the back seat.\n\nDr. Lin smiled. \"Let's go home and have dinner with Mom and Dad first.\"\n\n\"Ooh, does that mean you're planning to come out tonight, sis?\"\n\n\"I am, after all, his legal wife.\" Dr. Lin said nothing more, started the car, and drove away.\n\nWatching the car leave,\n\nZhou Ze shouted to the workers beside him, \"Hey fellas, is my wife pretty or what?\"\n\n\"Pretty!\"\n\n\"You're a lucky man!\"\n\n\"Gorgeous!\"\n\n\"Hahahaha.\"\n\nXu Qilang emerged from his shop carrying a large tray.\n\n\"Here we go, braised pork over rice! Fellas, dig in!\"\n\nThe workers were a bit reserved and hesitant. The oldest one said, a little embarrassed, \"We went out, we didn't bring any...\"\n\n\"We already agreed, it's my treat for my brothers! If you mention money again, you're not treating me like a brother. Who knows when we'll run into each other again out in the world. There might be a day when I need to ask you guys for a favor.\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\n\"Say no more!\"\n\n\"When you come to my hometown...\"\n\n\"Come on!\"\n\nThe workers all carried a large bowl of rice into the bookstore. They all squatted on the floor, placing their bowls on the plastic stools, and began to eat heartily.\n\nOne worker was eating and reading his novel at the same time and got a tap on the head with chopsticks from the worker next to him.\n\n\"You've got lard clouding your mind. What if you accidentally get the book dirty? How is the boss supposed to sell it then?\"\n\n\"You're right. Eat first.\"\n\nThe atmosphere was lively. Zhou Ze returned behind his counter. The dumplings were already a bit cold, but he managed to eat three more. This time, for some reason, maybe because of the atmosphere, his nausea was much less intense than before.\n\nAfter the meal,\n\nthe group continued to read.\n\nThe room was warm, there were novels to read, and the atmosphere was harmonious.\n\nUnconsciously, it was already ten o'clock at night.\n\nThe oldest worker stood up, stretched, and said, \"Fellas, it's time. Let's head back. Let's help clean up the place for him.\"\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\nThe five workers helped Zhou Ze sweep the shop from top to bottom.\n\n\"Boss, we're leaving. Thanks for today.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave.\n\nThey left.\n\nUnlike the girl with the corgi last night, who left a hundred-yuan bill after reading for a while, they had read for a whole day and half the night and hadn't left a single yuan.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't mind at all, nor did he feel the slightest bit of dissatisfaction.\n\nStretching, Zhou Ze was about to call Xu Qilang to collect the bowls and chopsticks from his shop. When he got to the noodle shop, Zhou Ze saw Xu Qilang sitting behind a table, reading a newspaper.\n\nYes, the newspaper Zhou Ze had given him that day.\n\nXu Qilang was wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses and did indeed look quite scholarly. A man with over twenty properties, as expected.\n\nHe looked distinguished no matter how you looked at him!\n\n\"The bowls and chopsticks over there, you can clear them,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright, I'll go right now.\"\n\nXu Qilang took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and got up to go next door to collect the dishes.\n\nOn top of the large stack of newspapers was a copy of the *Yangtze Evening Post*. The date was from seven days ago.\n\nThe front page headline was in large, bold, black type:\n\n**\"Residential Building Fire, A Moving Tale of Heroism\"**\n\nLast week, a fire broke out in a densely populated residential complex in Tongcheng. The fire was severe.\n\nFive young construction workers from a nearby site rushed into the building to save people without regard for their own safety. They rescued a total of more than twenty elderly people, women, and children. But after they rushed into the fire for the last time to save more people,\n\nthey never came back out.\n\nThe front page of the *Yangtze Evening Post* had a large photograph.\n\nIt was a group photo of the five men.\n\nThey stood shoulder to shoulder, making old-fashioned peace signs. It seemed to be a photo taken when they first arrived at the construction site and shared a dormitory.\n\nTheir faces, youthful yet etched with a hint of worldly weariness,\n\nin the photograph,\n\nwere smiling, a bit bashfully, but also brilliantly.\n\nXu Qilang walked into the bookstore.\n\nHe looked at the five bowls of braised pork rice sitting on the plastic stools.\n\nNot a single bite had been taken. The food had long since gone cold.\n\nIn each bowl of rice, a pair of chopsticks was stuck straight up.\n\n\"Fellas,\"\n\n\"Eat well,\"\n\n\"Drink well.\"\n\nXu Qilang murmured.\n\nOutside,\n\nthe sound of firecrackers erupted.\n\nTongcheng hadn't banned fireworks. For a moment, the sky was filled with colorful bursts, lively and festive.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head and looked outside.\n\nHe whispered softly:\n\n\"It's the New Year.\"\n\n---\n[^1]: 坑爹 (kēngdiē): A popular internet slang term literally meaning \"to screw over one's father.\" It's used to express frustration or complain that something is a rip-off, deeply disappointing, or not what it was supposed to be.",

    "content": "The sound of firecrackers bids farewell to the old year. After midnight, the pops and bangs of fireworks came from all directions, creating an exceptionally lively and dense cacophony. What had been sparse and scattered sounds now took on an earth-shattering momentum.\n\nZhou Ze blew on his fingernails. The clamor outside had little to do with him. He had no home—though in name, he now had a \"home\"—but he didn't want to go back.\n\nMany people, while living, have had the thought of what they would do if they could be reborn.\n\nTo write with soaring passion, to command the world with a flourish, to dismiss the feudal lords of old as mere dirt.¹\n\nBut when you truly return from hell, you suddenly discover that your old pursuits, your old ideas, your old aspirations, are like when a kindergarten teacher asks: \"Children, what do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\nAnd all the children answer together: \"Scientists, doctors, astronauts, soldiers...\"\n\nDreams are always full and plump.\n\nReality, while not exactly skeletal, is such that a person's adrenaline is bound to be finite.\n\nSometimes, just being able to breathe, to hear sounds, to sit here and slack off, to waste a bit of time...\n\nThis, perhaps, is what it truly means for the days to be peaceful and good.\n\nXu Qinglang was sleeping at the shop again tonight. Zhou Ze heard him lock the shop door.\n\nHe said he had over twenty properties, but Zhou Ze knew his parents were right here in the shop.\n\nA family should be whole and together.²\n\nThis New Year, naturally, was even more important.\n\nOutside, it began to rain. A dampness started to seep in, making one feel a bit oppressed.\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang. It was his wife.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nZhou Ze thought it was a stupid question.\n\n*If I were asleep, who would be answering your call?*\n\n*A dead man... no, a dead ghost?*\n\n*Wait, there seems to be a problem with that thought.*\n\nZhou Ze leaned back slightly in his chair. He pictured Dr. Lin gently poking his chest and calling him, \"You old ghost...\"\n\nFor the first time, he felt how dazzlingly intoxicating the literal truth could be.\n\nPerhaps he was too bored, or maybe just plain idle,\n\nZhou Ze found his thoughts starting to wander.\n\nHe was thinking... a bit too much.\n\n\"Nope,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Creeaak...\"\n\nDr. Lin pushed open the shop door and walked in. She held a red umbrella, wore leather pants on her lower half, and a white sweater on top. Her hair was draped over her shoulders.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze forgot to put down the phone.\n\nThis woman...\n\n...was indeed very beautiful.\n\nEspecially her aura, which always gave you that feeling of \"if life were only like the first time we met,\"³ instantly piercing a man's heart.\n\n\"Afraid I'd be lonely and cold by myself?\" Zhou Ze stood up and poured Dr. Lin a glass of water.\n\nShe was the mistress of this place.\n\nWell,\n\nTo be precise, the money Xu Le had used to open this bookstore came from her family.\n\nDr. Lin took the water, shook her head, and said nothing.\n\nThe two of them were husband and wife, but in reality, they were like the most familiar of strangers, stuck in a position even more awkward than that of a male confidant.\n\nTo take a step forward was difficult;\n\nTo take a step back was even harder.\n\n\"Let's go for a walk,\" Zhou Ze said, feeling the room was a bit stuffy. Besides, he couldn't possibly invite Dr. Lin up to his sleeping quarters on the second floor.\n\nEven if Dr. Lin had taken the wrong medicine today and planned to offer her body to the tiger, the sight of the freezer on his second floor would probably make her immediately dial the number of a familiar psychiatric hospital and have him sent in for some serious rehabilitation.\n\n\"It's raining,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"A light rain, it's fine.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, relaxed and casual.\n\n...\n\n\"Whoooosh...\"\n\nThe rain got heavy. Very heavy.\n\nZhou Ze, who had earlier planned to experience the precious spring rain without an umbrella, was now soaked like a drowned rat. Dr. Lin still held her umbrella, standing to the side. Zhou Ze had refused her offer to share it.\n\nThis was a front he'd put on himself, and he had to see it through, even with tears in his eyes.\n\nPatting his soaking wet hair, Zhou Ze shivered. He wasn't particularly afraid of the cold; in fact, he was quite resistant to freezing. It was just that the woman beside him, despite being mostly dry under the umbrella, was still trembling slightly.\n\nThe bus stop shelter could block most of the rain,\n\nbut the cold night wind still blew through with impunity.\n\nPetty-bourgeois sentimentality,\n\na man and a woman alone together,\n\nsoaked on a rainy night,\n\na beauty inspiring pity...\n\nThis should have been a great opportunity, a perfect opening for the two to cultivate their feelings. It could even have led to sparks flying, a \"mistake in the flower fields,\"⁴ and one last shot hitting the mark,⁵ but the two of them stood in relative silence.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. Dr. Lin just stood beside him.\n\nOne wanted to escape, the other was resistant by nature; naturally, they couldn't meet in the middle.\n\nA melon plucked by force is never sweet; both the melon and the vine feel awkward.\n\nIn his heart, Zhou Ze grumbled a bit at Xu Le. If that coward had just forced himself on her after they got married, none of this mess would be happening now. Even if Dr. Lin had become a married woman or had a child, she would probably still be devastatingly beautiful, maybe even scoring some extra points.\n\nAnd he could have just gone with the flow. Why was he in this dilemma now, unable to advance or retreat?\n\nOf course, this complaint was quite unfair to Xu Le. If Zhou Ze himself had forced the issue that night, would Dr. Lin have desperately fought back, screaming \"Indecent assault!\"? And then called the police to have Zhou Ze sent to the Public Security Bureau? To accuse him of rape?\n\nThe rain was still falling.\n\nZhou Ze tossed his cigarette butt to the ground.\n\n\"Did you drive here?\"\n\n\"Took a taxi,\" Dr. Lin replied.\n\n\"I'll see you home.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThere was no need to dwell on how this seemingly silly and naive New Year's Eve road-stroll in the rain had begun.\n\nAt least, right now, both of them felt that ending it here was the most appropriate thing to do.\n\nHailing a rideshare, Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin got in together.\n\nFifteen minutes later, they arrived. Zhou Ze got out with Dr. Lin. The driver settled the fare and drove off immediately.\n\nHome was just upstairs, but Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin didn't go straight up.\n\nThe scene was a bit like a junior high couple walking the girl home at night. Downstairs, it's time to part, a moment of lingering, cloying affection.\n\nBut the atmosphere here wasn't even as rich as that of shy junior high students. It was like meat broth without salt or MSG—tasteless to eat, but a waste to throw out.\n\n\"You're not coming up?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"Not going. Let's wait a while, then we'll talk again. Our business will be taken care of then.\"\n\nDr. Lin understood the meaning behind his words. \"I'm sorry,\" she said.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, then reached out. He had intended to pat Dr. Lin's shoulder, but once his hand was on it, he felt a sudden impulse and pulled her into an embrace.\n\nDr. Lin's body stiffened for a moment, but she didn't resist.\n\nThey drew a little closer, but it wasn't an intimate gesture. Considering their relationship, it could even be called distant.\n\nShe smelled nice. He wondered what brand of body wash she used. In any case, it was a pleasant scent.\n\n\"I've always been curious about something. Is there someone else in your heart?\" Zhou Ze added, \"And that 'someone else' could be a man or a woman.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Dr. Lin was very honest. She didn't even hesitate in her reply.\n\nBefore, her husband had been timid and shrinking, which made her feel she couldn't be harsh.\n\nNow, her husband seemed like a different person, which also allowed her to shed some of her burdens.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze grunted, his gaze shifting slightly upward, as if to see if a certain protective coloring had appeared above his head.\n\nHe was still a little disappointed.\n\nHe couldn't say it was love.\n\nHe couldn't say he liked her that much.\n\nThey were barely even familiar.\n\nBut she, no matter what, was his woman in name. And yet, he'd still been cuckolded.\n\n*Well, any man...*\n\n*No,*\n\n*Any male creature...*\n\n*...would probably not be too happy about this sort of thing.*\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" This was the second time she'd said it.\n\nZhou Ze released her, and they slowly separated.\n\n\"Saying sorry makes us sound like strangers.\" Zhou Ze leaned back against a nearby stone bollard and sat down. The rain had lessened, and there was a small eave here.\n\n\"I'll give you another sum of money. You can open another bookstore,\" Dr. Lin said, then added another, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to wave his hand magnanimously and say, \"I don't care about the money.\"\n\nBut then he thought about his freezer, about his future life,\n\nand Zhou Ze suddenly found he couldn't get the words out.\n\n*What if,*\n\n*what if,*\n\n*what if this woman took him seriously, thought that giving him money was an insult, and then really didn't give him any compensation?*\n\n\"Let's talk in a few days.\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"That guy, what's he like?\"\n\n\"He's very handsome, in my opinion,\" Dr. Lin answered.\n\n*It's a man.*\n\n*Stab.*\n\n*Another knife.*\n\n*It would have been easier to accept if it were a woman...*\n\nZhou Ze felt the intensity of the photosynthesis above his head growing even stronger.\n\n\"There's no chance, is there?\" Zhou Ze asked a very stupid question. He regretted it as soon as he asked, but then consoled himself: *I'm asking for the pitiful Xu Le.*\n\n*You've occupied his body. Now that his wife is cheating, you should at least help him ask why, right?*\n\n*Yes, that's it.*\n\n\"No chance.\" Dr. Lin's reply was just as quick, and just as certain.\n\nThis woman was also a surgeon. Her style of speaking was truly decisive, like wielding a scalpel, every cut hitting a vital spot, never dragging things out.\n\nOtherwise, the patient would only suffer more. It seemed the same logic applied to matters of the heart.\n\n\"Fine, fine. I can't compare, I can't compare. It's fine. We'll each live our own lives. You go back and deal with your parents,\" Zhou Ze said, getting annoyed.\n\nDr. Lin nodded and turned to walk into the building entrance.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, ready to call a cab, but just then, a call from an unknown number came in.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Sir, I've driven back.\"\n\n\"So smart?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised. He recognized the voice of the previous driver.\n\n\"You left a bag on the back seat. I brought it back for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\nThe car drove back to the apartment building. From the window, the driver handed out a woman's handbag.\n\n\"Please check it.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony. He opened Dr. Lin's bag. Inside was just a phone, a wallet, a charging cable, and a few packs of tissues.\n\nTaking out the wallet, Zhou Ze froze as soon as he opened it.\n\nHis gaze was fixed on the photo slot in the wallet.\n\nThere was a photograph there.\n\nThe woman in the photo looked very young, even a little... naive, wearing an ill-fitting white doctor's coat.\n\nAnd the man to the girl's right... Zhou Ze felt a strange sense of familiarity.\n\nHe stared blankly for a good while,\n\nbefore Zhou Ze finally recognized him.\n\n*Isn't that me?*\n\nIt was a cropped picture. It must have been from a group photo, but it had been cut to show just the two of them.\n\n\"Is anything missing?\" the driver urged.\n\n\"It's all here. Thanks, Master Driver. You can go.\"\n\nThe driver drove away.\n\nZhou Ze continued to stare at the wallet. It didn't even occur to him that he should call Dr. Lin and tell her to come down and get her bag.\n\nSome memories, not long-buried but not often thought of, began to surface.\n\nHe vaguely remembered...\n\n...about five or six years ago, he had supervised a group of students assigned from the university for an internship. There was a girl, her surname seemed to be Lin, and her appearance... seemed to match the girl in the photo.\n\nA girl changes a lot from her teens to her twenties.\n\nA smile crept onto Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nTo think Dr. Lin had such an adorkable phase back then. Who knew that five or six years later she would blossom into such a beauty. He really hadn't noticed this girl's potential for growth at all.\n\nMoreover, at the time, he had been very perfunctory about the hospital making him supervise interns, treating these students purely as \"medical dogs\"⁶ to be worked.\n\nZhou Ze shook the wallet in his hand.\n\n\"Damn it, serves you right for being single until you were almost thirty.\"\n\nThis time, surprisingly, he wasn't cursing Xu Le.\n\nHe was cursing himself.\n\n\"My eyes...\n\n...were truly blind...\"\n\nZhou Ze spread his arms and stretched.\n\nThe person who had cuckolded him...\n\n...was actually himself.\n\nIn the early morning after the rain, on the first day of the Lunar New Year.\n\n*Heh heh.*\n\nHe gazed at the sky.\n\nHe very solemnly reached out and patted his own chest.\n\nZhou Ze paused.\n\nVery seriously, he said:\n\n\"Xu Le, you truly are my good brother!\n\nI shall raise your wife myself, you need not worry.\"⁷\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.

    "content": "The lingering smell of smoke from fireworks and firecrackers still filled the air. It was a bit acrid, but this seemed to be the smell the New Year was supposed to have—what was commonly known as the holiday spirit.¹\n\nEspecially for Zhou Ze at this moment, life seemed to have gained a little more beauty.\n\nIt wasn't some romance of eternal vows, nor was it as dramatic as \"till the mountains crumble and the heavens collapse.\"\n\nIt was simply like a child who usually had no pocket money finding a ten-yuan bill on the street, and instead of a passing policeman, there was a convenience store right nearby.\n\nA trip through hell, a change of body—to this day, there were still many troubles, both discovered and undiscovered, that needed solving. His own personality had also undergone a significant, unwitting change.\n\nThinking back to himself in his past life, having left the orphanage, his mind was filled with thoughts of climbing up step by step with his own two hands and abilities. In fact, looking back closely, the reason he'd ignored Dr. Lin back then was probably not because of how dorky or plain she might have been five years ago. The young woman back then must have also been budding with affection; otherwise, she wouldn't have cut out that photo and kept it in her wallet.\n\nIt was just a pity that back then, he had neither the energy nor the inclination to glance at the scenery along the way. His obsession was too strong, and he carried an air of deep-seated bitterness while pretending to be so cool he was a cut above the rest.\n\nUnlike now. He'd died once and come back, and in its place was the carefree yet melancholy feeling of \"an official without a post.\"\n\nBut no matter what,\n\nthe feeling of being secretly loved, even the \"loved beyond death\" feeling,\n\nwas indeed quite nice.\n\nHe made the call, and Dr. Lin came down again. She came down in a bit of a hurry, took her handbag from Zhou Ze's hands, and smiled, but didn't say thank you. Given their current relationship, saying \"thank you\" was even more inappropriate than saying \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nWaving goodbye,\n\nZhou Ze left, showing only his back.\n\nTime to go home and sleep.\n\nAnd then wait for tomorrow; tomorrow would be a better day.\n\nDr. Lin felt her husband's mood seemed to have changed slightly, as if a heavy burden had been lifted.\n\nPerhaps it was a good thing that both of them could come to terms with it.\n\nRather than awkwardly staying entangled, it was better to separate gracefully and each face life anew.\n\nOne could only say that life is unpredictable. Dr. Lin could never have imagined that inside her husband's body lived another soul.\n\nThe soul of the man whom she, as a young, naive intern, had adored.\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze hailed another car and then squatted by the residential complex gate, smoking. His phone screen kept showing a \"searching\" message. Zhou Ze felt a bit of regret. Why did he let that driver go? He should have asked him to wait so he could take his car back to the bookstore.\n\nAnd now look.\n\nOn the night of New Year's Eve,\n\nit was really hard to get a car.\n\nAfter waiting for about ten minutes and smoking three cigarettes, Zhou Ze was getting annoyed. He stood up straight and stretched. Although he wasn't particularly afraid of the cold, walking all the way back would be pretty tiring.\n\nJust then, a black sedan drove up the road in front of Zhou Ze. As it passed him, it slowed down.\n\n\"Need a ride?\" The driver stuck his head out the window. He had a big, round face, was middle-aged, unshaven, and wore a black cotton-padded jacket.\n\n\"Yes.\" Zhou Ze had no other choice.\n\n\"Get in. I won't overcharge you,\" the driver said with a smile.\n\nZhou Ze got in, gave the bookstore's location, settled on a price, and the driver started the car again.\n\nThis car, it must be new. The seat cushions still gave off a plastic and leather smell, and the interior was very clean.\n\nGenerally, very few people were willing to use a new car to drive for hire.\n\n\"That place is pretty remote.\" The driver proactively offered Zhou Ze a cigarette, which he accepted.\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\"You live there?\"\n\n\"My shop is there.\"\n\n\"Oh, business must not be great, right?\" That commercial center had been dead for a long time, with almost no foot traffic. Many people knew this.\n\n\"You're not a local?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe local dialect of Tongcheng was different from others; it sounded almost like a different language compared to Mandarin and was easy to distinguish.\n\n\"I'm from Rongcheng. I work here.\" The driver lit his cigarette. \"Go on, smoke. Don't be polite.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit his cigarette too, took a drag, and frowned slightly. The cigarette tasted unusually bland.\n\n\"Not going back for the New Year?\"\n\n\"Wife and kids are at home, everything's fine. I'm not going back. Figured I'd earn a bit more money.\" The driver stuck his hand out the window and flicked his ash. \"I have four kids.\"\n\n\"That's impressive,\" Zhou Ze said admiringly.\n\n\"It's tough, too.\" The driver smacked his lips. \"My wife's first was a son, the second was a boy too. I really wanted a daughter, but the third was another boy. Luckily, the fourth was finally a girl. I'm content now.\"\n\n\"Nice,\" Zhou Ze agreed. He took another drag and then tossed the cigarette out the window. It was so bland it was like smoking a paper tube.\n\n\"I don't have old-fashioned ideas, and I'm not sexist. I just like kids and wanted to have a few more, haha.\" When talking about his children, the driver became much more talkative.\n\n\"Haven't paid the fine for the youngest yet. When it's time for her to start school, I'll pay the money and get her household registration sorted. Oh right, what kind of shop do you run?\"\n\n\"A bookstore.\"\n\n\"How's business?\" The driver really knew how to pick at a sore spot.\n\n\"Not great.\"\n\n\"Right. These days you can buy books online, and with coupons too.\"\n\nUp ahead on the road, there was a car accident. The traffic police had set up a roadblock. What was originally a four-lane road was now down to a single lane. Luckily, there weren't many cars on the road late on New Year's Eve, so it shouldn't cause too much of a delay.\n\n\"Getting into an accident on New Year's, what rotten luck.\" The driver blew a smoke ring. He spoke with the critical tone of a leader.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back, shifting into a more comfortable position, and asked, \"Did you just buy this car?\"\n\n\"Yeah, my son gave it to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"How old are you, and how old is your son?\"\n\n\"Hehe.\" The driver's eyes narrowed. \"My son's made me proud. These days, ambition isn't about age. If you've got hands, feet, and a brain, and your fate isn't full of bad luck, how can you stay poor?\"\n\n\"That's the truth,\" Zhou Ze nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Beep... beep...\"\n\nA car behind them seemed to be in a hurry to get home, honking its horn frequently, urging the cars ahead to get a move on.\n\n\"Hurry, hurry, hurry, what's the rush? Rushing to see a ghost?\"\n\nThe driver had a bit of a showy temper. He leaned out of the window again and yelled at the car behind him.\n\nBut the cars behind them only honked more frequently, as if in deliberate defiance.\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nThe driver made a move to open his door, ready to get out and have a proper argument.\n\nJust then, the traffic cop directing traffic up ahead gestured for their lane to pass through quickly. Only then did the driver sheepishly sit back down, start the car, and drive on.\n\n\"Business is bad today.\" The driver started lamenting again. \"If I'd known, I would've just gone home to see my wife and kids.\"\n\n\"It's alright,\" Zhou Ze said noncommittally. He saw that the noodle shop next door was doing decent business. Most of the competition had closed for the New Year. Even if demand was a little lower during the holiday, there was still more business than before. Especially considering he'd just tried to hail a car for so long without anyone accepting the ride.\n\n\"Heh, it's really not easy.\" The driver shook his head again. \"I can't afford to rest. The kids' school fees, I have to send money home every month. I work my day job, then come out and drive for half the night. This life... it's pretty dull. I can't even bear to smoke a better pack of cigarettes.\"\n\n*Your cigarettes... seem to be fake,* Zhou Ze thought. He took out his own pack, pulled one out, and fiddled with it in his hand.\n\n\"But it's okay. The internet is convenient now. I can video call my wife and kids before bed when I get home. That's pretty good. I can see them.\" A look of relief appeared on the driver's face.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes slightly. He couldn't fall asleep, but right now, he didn't feel like talking or chatting.\n\nBut even without any feedback or reaction from Zhou Ze, the driver kept on talking. On New Year's Eve, he was a lonely stranger in a strange land; of course he was lonely.\n\nFrom naming his children, to their schools, to his own parents, to the local customs of his village, the driver rambled on about everything.\n\nIn the end, Zhou Ze just rested his forehead against the car window and urged, \"Master, can you drive a little faster?\"\n\nThis driver was going way too slow, maybe only thirty miles an hour.\n\nYou have to understand, this was an elevated highway.\n\nZhou Ze even wondered if the guy was just too lonely and was deliberately driving slowly to find someone to talk to, but Zhou Ze had no interest in being his confidante.\n\n\"Hehe, it's a new car. I'm not too familiar with it yet, so I don't dare to drive too fast.\" The driver stroked the steering wheel preciously. \"This car isn't expensive, in fact it's pretty cheap, but it's a gift from my eldest son. I have to treasure it and take good care of it. I'll try to use this car to run my business for a few years, and after my eldest son finds a girlfriend, I'll get him an apartment. Handle them one by one. I don't want the older one to have to raise the younger ones. That's not fair to the eldest. After all, the one who decided to have them was me, their dad. As long as I can still work, I have to grit my teeth and bear it. I'm not an irresponsible person, and I'd never do something like having kids but not raising them.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nHe was getting annoyed.\n\nThen he lit one of his own cigarettes and took a drag.\n\n\"Master, really, I'm begging you, please go faster.\" Zhou Ze was starting to miss his freezer. And he was also regretting not having asked Dr. Lin to drive him back.\n\n\"Don't be in such a rush, young man. It's the New Year, our meeting is fate, isn't it? No need to rush. I get it, I get it, I'm an old pro...\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked his ash.\n\nHe accidentally missed the window.\n\nA bit of ash landed on the inside of the car door.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nthe ash burned a hole right through the inner panel.\n\nA hole the size of a thumb.\n\nThe cool wind from outside whistled incessantly through the small opening.\n\n***\n¹年味兒 (niánwèi'er): Literally \"New Year's flavor,\" this term refers to the atmosphere, customs, and feeling associated with the Lunar New Year celebration.",

    "content": "For someone who doesn't know cars, buying one is a real headache. You inevitably have to consult friends or relatives who are in the know; after all, some cars certainly have their weaknesses, and there might be existing issues, whether in quality or performance.\n\nBut when it comes down to it,\n\na car whose door you can burn a hole through with a cigarette butt...\n\n...you can't just wave that away as a \"quality issue,\" can you?\n\nAll of this points to only one thing.\n\nThis is a...\n\n...paper car!\n\nThe driver was a middle-aged man, but his eldest son was probably only elementary school-aged. That's why when the driver said this car was \"sent\" to him by his son,\n\nthe \"sent\" here,¹\n\ncould also be written as \"burned.\"\n\nThe father died,\n\nand his son burned a paper car for him.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. To be honest, he hadn't noticed at first. It was only after getting in the car that he belatedly sensed something was off, but he still wanted to play dumb.\n\nHe himself was a stowaway, and he had no aspirations of playing the part of a great exorcist.\n\nAt the end of the day, he was also a ghost.\n\nIf he were to take up the banner of vanquishing demons and defending righteousness, he'd be no different from a collaborator—a \"ghost traitor.\"\n\nPlacing his palm over the small hole to cover it, Zhou Ze feigned drowsiness, half-closing his eyes and pretending that nothing had happened.\n\nZhou Ze remembered a teacher from his time at the orphanage. This teacher usually led the children in physical education activities and had a part-time job—manning the main gate.\n\nAnd because his surname was Qin, the children at the time called him—Gatekeeper Uncle Qin.\n\nUncle Qin was a great storyteller and often told ghost stories. He seemed to take great satisfaction in the frightened expressions on the children's faces when they heard his tales. The orphanage director spoke with him about it several times, but he didn't tone it down.\n\nBut just before Zhou Ze left the orphanage to attend school elsewhere, Uncle Qin passed away from a heart attack.\n\nZhou Ze remembered a ghost story Uncle Qin had once told, called \"Ghosts Carrying a Sedan Chair.\"\n\nAccording to legend, in ancient times, there were many different kinds of ghosts. After most people died, they went directly to the Underworld, entered the Yellow Springs, drank Meng Po's Soup of Forgetfulness, and re-entered the cycle of reincarnation. Very few ghosts were able to remain in the mortal world.\n\nBut some ghosts did stay. They might have known they were dead, or they might not have, but regardless, they may have continued doing what they did in life.\n\nFor example, sedan bearers.\n\nThey would appear on deserted roads or late at night, asking people if they wanted a ride in a sedan chair. The price would be set extremely low. Once the passenger reached their destination, the transaction would be settled.\n\nBut for a living person to do business with a ghost, to enjoy a service provided by a ghost, would never be that simple. When ghosts carry a sedan chair, what they want isn't something as base as money; they want your lifespan, or your very essence and spirit.\n\nIn the underworld, ghosts carry sedans for figures like King Yama. What status does a living person have? Are they worthy?\n\nIt's like having an eighty-year-old man kneel to you—it would shorten your life.\n\nZhou Ze remembered this story, and very clearly at that. In fact, Zhou Ze still remembered many of the stories Uncle Qin told, not forgetting them even after becoming an adult and starting work.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze knew that the day before Uncle Qin's sudden death, Uncle Qin, who usually only guarded the gate and never entered the back courtyard, broke his rule and walked into the children's dormitories. He looked through each room, one by one, looked at each child, one by one. At the time, Zhou Ze happened to be awake and saw this scene.\n\nIt was as if Uncle Qin knew his time was up and had come to say goodbye in advance.\n\nJust as a fart from Warren Buffett can make people think it holds a profound financial secret,\n\nwhen a man who knows he's probably going to GG tomorrow tells a ghost story, you can't really treat it as mere nonsense.\n\nThe driver was still rambling on, continuing to shoot the bull, while Zhou Ze remained calm in the back.\n\nShorten his life?\n\nDrain his essence and spirit?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't particularly afraid. He wasn't a living person; he was also a ghost.\n\nTo put it bluntly, although Zhou Ze didn't understand the stratification and class divisions of ghosts, the fact that he could walk under the sun, meet living people, and run a business meant he had to be much higher-grade than the wandering spirits out there, right?\n\nBesides, even the faceless woman in the Hell Pool could be wounded by his fingernails. When facing other ghostly beings, Zhou Ze actually felt quite confident.\n\n\"These days, more and more people are buying and driving cars, and more and more people don't follow the rules,\" the driver continued to chat. Even though Zhou Ze didn't respond or join in, he could still carry on a conversation by himself.\n\n\"When the forest gets big enough, it'll have all kinds of birds. All in all, if you really get angry at every single one of them, you'd honestly lose many years of your life.\n\n\"Even though you know in your heart you shouldn't get angry, some people go out with a sign practically plastered on their foreheads that says, 'Go on, hit me, you bastard, run me over already.' It's really infuriating.\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed. He felt a bit sleepy, even wanting to fall asleep.\n\nBut he knew he couldn't actually sleep, and therefore, this distinct sensation he was feeling had to be fake.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly let out a small, wry laugh.\n\nHe understood why the driver had been chattering nonstop the whole way. It wasn't that the driver didn't know he was being annoying by talking so much.\n\nIt was because he hadn't fallen asleep yet, so the driver had to keep talking to pretend everything was normal.\n\nHe was trying to make him fall asleep.\n\nAnd his own reaction to sleep-inducing effects had always been very slow.\n\nA smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth. He placed his hand on the car seat and closed his eyes.\n\n*Fine, I'll sleep.*\n\nThe car began to slow down.\n\nThe driver's voice also grew quieter and quieter as Zhou Ze \"fell asleep.\"\n\nAt the same time, the driver specifically turned his head to look behind him.\n\nHowever, just then, a look of struggle suddenly appeared on the driver's face. Finally, he shook his head forcefully, sighed, and continued driving forward.\n\nIt looked like they were almost at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know how a ghost driving a paper car was able to transport him, a person with a physical body.\n\nIt was difficult to explain, as there's no branch of physics called \"ghost mechanics.\"\n\nThen again, ancient Chinese legends have concepts like \"Yellow Turban Strongmen\" and \"Qi Men Dun Jia.\" It was probably something along those lines.\n\nZhou Ze slowly woke up, because he could sense that the body of the driver in front of him was slowly evaporating in a shimmer of light.\n\n*Interesting.*\n\n*It seems I've been running into good ghosts lately.*\n\nThis driver was supposed to \"collect payment\" from him, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. It must have been his first time doing this kind of thing, and in the end, he couldn't go through with it. In that struggle, he had found his own release and redemption.\n\nHe was beginning to dissipate.\n\nAfter dissipating, he would enter hell and rejoin the cycle of reincarnation.\n\nFrom this, it was clear that not all the \"nonsense\" the driver had spouted was false. He had four children, he enjoyed the feeling of being a father, and he worked hard to earn money to support his family and provide a good environment for his kids.\n\nHe was a good father. In terms of character and personality, he was decent enough. After becoming a ghost, he had wanted to get into the \"ghosts carrying a sedan chair\" business, but ultimately, his heart was too soft.\n\nZhou Ze slowly lifted his head and opened his eyes. The driver didn't notice, still absorbed in his driving.\n\nGradually, Zhou Ze saw light shining in from outside. Through the window, he could see the bustling traffic on the road.\n\nThe driver was about to dissipate.\n\nThis must be a fragment of the driver's memories from before his death.\n\nSimilar to the principle of how lightning combined with a special environment can supposedly record a scene.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously lit another cigarette. Since the driver had already found his own release, it wouldn't matter even if he burned this entire car down.\n\nMusic was playing in the car; it was a recently popular song called \"Chilly.\"²\n\nThe driver hummed along as he drove. He must have just finished a big fare and was in a good mood, planning to go home, add a plate of peanuts to his meal, and video chat with his kids for a while. Though life was hard, it was also pretty sweet.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw a minibus appear on the road ahead of the car.\n\nIt must have been a school bus. It had the school crest printed on it, along with the words \"XXX Elementary School.\"\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't think much of it, but then a girl suddenly stood up in the back seat of the bus. She was facing the rear of the bus, and even from the car behind, he could see her clearly through the glass.\n\nThe girl was wearing a cute, blue pleated skirt.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nHe knew this girl. He had saved her. He'd heard she had already woken up; Dr. Lin had even mentioned to him a while back that the girl's father wanted to host a thank-you dinner and had planned to invite him.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze darkened. So, this driver was the culprit who caused that car crash?\n\nSo many children were injured.\n\nAnd if he hadn't intervened, some children would have even died.\n\n\"What a pretty little girl. Just like my youngest.\"\n\nThe driver muttered to himself. This was the final scene from his memories, so he had no idea there was someone else sitting in the back seat.\n\nZhou Ze looked around. He didn't think the driver had been drinking, nor did he seem to have any other issues. So, what was the reason he crashed into the school bus? What caused that accident?\n\nWas it a chain-reaction collision caused by a nearby car?\n\nAnd just at that moment,\n\nthe girl in the pleated skirt, who had been standing at the very back of the school bus, suddenly opened her mouth. Her tongue shot out.\n\nYes,\n\nshot out.\n\nLike a red carpet for a premiere, it just unrolled, long... so very long... long enough to make one's scalp tingle.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nthe girl's eyes held a mocking smile, fixed deadly still on the driver in front of her.\n\n\"Oh god, a ghost!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nIn his panic, the driver stomped on the accelerator, and the car shot directly toward the school bus in front of them.\n\n\"BOOM!\"\n\nSparks flew.\n\nZhou Ze was standing at the entrance of his bookstore.\n\nOn the ground around him were the still-smoldering ashes of the paper car, scattering with the wind, curling and falling, dissolving into final, tiny specks.\n\nThere wasn't a scratch on Zhou Ze's body. Not a single one.\n\nAnd that driver had kept his promise, delivering him to his destination.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't rush back into the bookstore.\n\nThe cigarette was still between his fingers, burning slowly.\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\n\"Uncle, there's no smoking in the hospital, you know,\" the girl's voice echoed in his ears.\n\nWhat...\n\nexactly...\n\n...did I save?\n\n***\n\n¹ The Chinese characters for \"sent/bring along\" (捎, *shāo*) and \"burn\" (燒, *shāo*) are homophones.\n² The song title 《涼涼》 (*Liángliáng*) literally means \"Chilly,\" but in modern internet slang, it means \"doomed\" or \"it's over.\"",

    "content": "The next morning, after washing up, Zhou Ze went to the noodle shop next door as usual. This was gradually becoming a part of his routine. When eating was no longer a process of enjoyment, it became purely a task. And for tasks, simple and efficient was best. Nowhere was more convenient and quick than Xu Qinglang's place.\n\n\"Bitter melon juice.\" Xu Qinglang placed a large glass in front of Zhou Ze, then brought over a serving of egg fried rice.\n\nZhou Ze took a tentative sip. The moment the liquid entered his throat, he felt an unbearable bitterness fill his mouth. Then, after swallowing, even his intestines and stomach felt like they were tying themselves in knots.\n\nAfter about ten seconds, Zhou Ze finally recovered and let out a long breath.\n\nIt was truly bitter.\n\n\"Haha, packs a punch, right?\" Xu Qinglang wore an expression that begged for praise, then sat down across from Zhou Ze. \"Seriously, you have some extreme tastes. You can't eat without drinking this stuff?\"\n\nZhou Ze calmed himself, then downed the entire large glass of bitter melon juice in one go. He immediately snatched up his chopsticks and began to wolf down the egg fried rice in front of him.\n\nA minute later, Zhou Ze finished his meal, set the plate down, and closed his eyes.\n\n\"That way of eating... you're the spitting image of a hungry ghost that crawled up from hell,\" Xu Qinglang teased.\n\nWhether this was just a joke or had some other meaning was anyone's guess.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes and glanced at the other man. That day, when the spirits of the five construction worker brothers returned on the seventh day after their deaths, it was normal that his sister-in-law and wife couldn't see them. But this noodle shop owner could. Otherwise, he wouldn't have made those five servings of braised pork over rice.\n\nBut between the two of them, there was a tacit understanding to see but not speak of it, and they had never tried to pierce that paper-thin veil. Perhaps this was the best way for them to get along.\n\n\"Why aren't you taking orders today?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nIn the past few days, even on New Year's Eve, Xu Qinglang's phone had been constantly buzzing with delivery orders. But today, it was much quieter, and no delivery drivers had come to pick up food.\n\n\"Taking a break.\" Xu Qinglang took out a cigarette, stuck one in his mouth, and passed one to Zhou Ze.\n\nAlthough it was a bit strange to work on New Year's Eve and rest afterward, as a man who owned over twenty properties, he certainly had the capital to be willful.\n\n\"Have you heard of a ghost-carried sedan chair?\" Zhou Ze asked. The events of last night were still fresh in his mind, but he hadn't rushed to do anything about it. He had simply gone home and slept in his freezer.\n\nZhou Ze himself had indeed saved the person. If there were any other problems, Zhou Ze didn't want to get involved.\n\nHe was just carefully, earnestly, and cheerfully living his own little life. If he happened to encounter things he could handle along the way, he would, but he wouldn't force anything.\n\nEven if there really was something wrong with that little girl in the lily-print dress, it was no longer his business.\n\n\"Ghost-carried sedan chair?\" Xu Qinglang paused for a moment, then chuckled. \"Heh heh, there are probably a lot of those on New Year's Eve. They say that when everyone burns scriptures and paper money for the new year, the ghosts get some spare cash and can finally afford to take a taxi.\"\n\nXu Qinglang continued spouting nonsense, then yawned. \"By the way, why isn't your bookstore open yet?\"\n\n\"I'll open it tonight.\"\n\n\"Fine, have it your way.\" Xu Qinglang took out his phone and glanced at it a couple of times. \"How about we go see a movie this afternoon?\"\n\nThe scene instantly fell into an awkward silence.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze refused.\n\n\"See, so ungrateful. After I went through all the trouble of mixing a new juice for you, you won't even see a movie with me. Men... not a single one of them is any good.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"My apologies, I forgot I'm a man myself.\" Xu Qinglang shook his head with a mournful air, looking as if he bitterly regretted not being born a woman.\n\n\"Did you suffer some kind of psychological trauma as a child?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I know a few psychologists who could help you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang let out a \"Tch\" and laughed.\n\n\"Heterosexuality is just a heresy created for the sake of procreation. Only homosexuality can be true love.\"\n\n\"I can't say I agree.\"\n\n\"Those whose paths are different cannot walk together.\"\n\nAnd with that, their post-meal conversation ended on a sour note.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore, opened the door, and after a moment's thought, decided not to lock it. He simply sat down behind the counter, turned on his computer, and sent a WeChat message to Dr. Lin:\n\n\"Go to the movies this afternoon?\"\n\nAfter about ten minutes, Dr. Lin replied:\n\n\"Working.\"\n\nThe New Year holiday didn't stop people from getting sick or having accidents. Having been a doctor himself, Zhou Ze knew that hospital holidays were mostly for show.\n\nIt was understandable, but he still felt a bit disappointed.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to tell her that he was Zhou Ze, not some guy named Xu Le.\n\nBut he worried the outcome would be Dr. Lin being so frightened she'd question her own sanity, and that it would even destroy the hazy, one-sided crush she had. Of course, the most important thing was that the fewer people who knew certain things, the better.\n\nSomeone would come for him.\n\nZhou Ze was very clear on this point.\n\nWhile he waited, he hadn't chosen to curl up and tremble in some dark corner like a sewer rat. He still needed to live, and to live very normally. Otherwise, he might as well have not come out of hell and just followed the main procession down the Yellow Springs Road.\n\nAs for the neighbor next door, whether he had figured anything out, Zhou Ze didn't know, nor could he be bothered to find out.\n\n\"Tonight, maybe.\"\n\nDr. Lin sent another message.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. He felt his smile was like that of a complete idiot, throwing him right back to his middle school days when he saw the class study monitor glance his way shyly.\n\nIn his past life, he had lived under too much strain.\n\nIn this life, he had to live a bit more freely and unrestrained.\n\nMany of life's truths are only truly understood just before death or in old age, but by the time you understand, you've already lost the chance to start over.\n\nZhou Ze cherished his current life and opportunity.\n\nA small red car pulled up on the road in front of the bookstore, and two females got out.\n\nOne was a woman not yet thirty, the other a little girl who looked to be only five or six.\n\nThe woman wore a red dress, her hair flowing. Though a mother, it was hard to hide her captivating charm; in fact, it made her all the more capable of stirring one's heartstrings.\n\nThe girl wore overalls, and she must have had several layers of thermal wear underneath, making her bundled up like a cute little rice dumpling.\n\nBut upon seeing the girl, Zhou Ze's eyes subconsciously narrowed.\n\n*He who has come comes with ill intent, and he who is friendly would not have come.*\n\nHe hadn't gone looking for her, but she had come looking for him.\n\nHe had felt a bit smug when he heard from Dr. Lin that the girl had been calling for her \"uncle\" at the thank-you dinner. Thinking back now, it was clear she had no intention of letting him go.\n\nWhen it came down to it, the death of that father of four was because of this little girl.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. The woman looked around with curiosity, while the little girl walked timidly to Zhou Ze's counter, looked at him, and said in a soft, sweet voice:\n\n\"Hello, Uncle.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, his expression somewhat reserved.\n\nIn reality, he was wondering if he should just whip out his fingernails and strangle this girl to death.\n\n\"Hello, I'm Rui Rui's mother.\"\n\nThe woman walked up to Zhou Ze and placed a gift box on the counter.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThe woman bowed to Zhou Ze, her sentiment deep and sincere.\n\n\"You're too kind.\" Zhou Ze still didn't get up.\n\nHe very much wanted to act as if everything were normal so that the girl wouldn't see through him.\n\nBut it was too difficult.\n\nEven an Oscar-winning actor, after seeing the memories of the driver's last moments last night, would probably find it hard to act nonchalant in front of this girl.\n\nSince he couldn't pull off the act, he might as well not even try.\n\n\"Mommy, I want to read here,\" Rui Rui said to the woman.\n\n\"Alright, Mommy is going to get her hair done first. You stay here and read with Uncle.\" The woman smiled at Zhou Ze. \"Sorry to trouble you.\"\n\n\"No trouble.\"\n\n\"It was Dr. Lin who told me you opened a shop here.\"\n\n*That silly woman.*\n\n\"You and Dr. Lin truly are a talented man and a beautiful woman.\"\n\nThat was a patently insincere thing to say. Even Xu Le himself wouldn't have believed it.\n\nThe woman drove off, leaving her daughter behind. This was a bookstore, after all. Plus, Zhou Ze was her daughter's quasi-savior and Dr. Lin's husband, so she felt very at ease leaving her daughter here for a while, not worried that anything would happen.\n\nNext, Rui Rui picked out a picture book herself and sat on a small plastic stool to read.\n\nShe wasn't noisy, nor did she make a fuss.\n\nShe didn't ask for a drink, nor did she whine for snacks.\n\nZhou Ze just sat behind the counter, watching her.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked in. Seeing the porcelain doll-like little girl, he immediately went over and picked her up.\n\n\"My, what a cute little girl.\"\n\n\"Thank you, big sister,\" Rui Rui replied.\n\nThe smile on Xu Qinglang's face bloomed like a chrysanthemum, growing ever more brilliant.\n\nThe little girl's flattery had hit him right in his sweet spot.\n\nZhou Ze, however, kept a sullen face and remained seated.\n\n\"Come out. I need to talk to you about something,\" Xu Qinglang said, putting the child down and gesturing at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked out.\n\n\"Some people from the plaza came by. They asked if we want to terminate our contracts. They can refund the rent we prepaid.\"\n\n\"Let's not.\" Zhou Ze didn't want the hassle of moving again for the time being. Besides, he didn't have enough capital. Even with the refunded rent, it wouldn't be enough to open a new shop.\n\n\"That's what I was thinking too.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, indicating he understood. \"So I'll represent you in the talks?\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\n\"Alright, it's settled then.\"\n\nThe two of them stood outside the shop door, smoked another cigarette, and then parted ways.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze turned around, pushed open the shop door, and walked back in, he found that the little girl was no longer on the row of small plastic stools. The picture book was left on one of them.\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nHe raised his head.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, the sound of little leather boots could be heard.\n\nThe little girl emerged from there, half her body revealed, the other half blocked by the wall.\n\nShe had just been...\n\non his second floor.",

    "content": "\"Did you go up and look?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little loli shook her head. \"It's dark up there, I couldn't see anything clearly.\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the little loli slowly walked back down and stood before Zhou Ze.\n\nShe was very short and wore many layers of clothing. Her delicate face was like an exquisite work of art.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that her tongue could be very, very long. So long... it made one's skin crawl.\n\n\"Uncle, I'm going to keep reading now.\"\n\nThe little loli gave a sweet, innocent smile, sat back down on the small plastic stool, picked up the illustrated children's book, and continued to read with relish.\n\nZhou Ze stood behind her, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\n*Strangle her.*\n\n*Strangle her.*\n\n*Whatever she's planning,*\n\n*There's no need to keep playing these games!*\n\nThis voice echoed in Zhou Ze's mind. It wasn't someone else's voice; it was his own.\n\nCompared to Xu Qinglang, the noodle shop owner next door, this little loli gave Zhou Ze a much greater sense of agitation and revulsion.\n\nHe had been the one to save her.\n\nShe was very cute,\n\nVery sensible,\n\nVery well-behaved,\n\nVery well-read and polite,\n\nPossessing a sense of propriety and discipline rarely seen in a child her age.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nit was precisely because his initial impression of her had been so incredibly good that when Zhou Ze witnessed her true colors, the resulting distortion and reversal in their relationship made his revulsion and rejection of her all the more intense.\n\nThe little loli continued to read her book, seemingly paying no mind to Zhou Ze behind her.\n\nZhou Ze stared at her, able to see even the fine downy hairs on the nape of her neck with perfect clarity.\n\n*Strangle,*\n\n*Or not,*\n\n*In the end,*\n\n*To strangle or not to strangle?*\n\n...\n\n\"Dad, Mom, your son is off today.\"\n\nIn the back room, Xu Qinglang had arranged several cold dishes and hot dishes on a small table, along with two cups of alcohol.\n\nOne cup was Moutai; his old man had loved its taste when he was alive.\n\nThe other was home-brewed rice wine. His mother hadn't drunk alcohol when she was alive and strongly disliked his father's drinking. On the rare occasion she attended a banquet where the host was overly enthusiastic, his mother would only drink a little rice wine.\n\nHis mother often said that rice wine was nourishing.\n\nOn the east and west corners of the small table, two candlesticks were also placed, their flames flickering.\n\nTwo sheets of human skin hung behind their respective seats, stirring as if in a nonexistent breeze.\n\nXu Qinglang first toasted his father and downed the cup, then took a small sip with his mother.\n\nHe picked up his chopsticks and said to his parents:\n\n\"Eat up, eat up. Dad, you're trying to steal my meat again!\"\n\nHe picked up several pieces of meat for himself, wolfing them down.\n\nIn his memory, when he was little, his father always liked to pretend to fight with him for the meat, but each time he would make him hastily gobble it down, leaving his mouth stuffed so full he couldn't swallow.\n\nAnd his mother, at that moment, would be chiding his father on one hand while gently patting his back on the other.\n\nToday was the first day of the Lunar New Year.\n\nMost people made offerings to their ancestors before the New Year.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang was different. He did it on this day, because his parents had died together in an accident on this very day.\n\nThe New Year,\n\nwhile it may have lost some of its so-called \"New Year spirit\" in the eyes of ordinary people, for Xu Qinglang, it meant the return of his own heartbreaking moment.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nXu Qinglang smiled,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Dad, Mom.\"\n\nHe pursed his lips,\n\npoured himself another cup of baijiu, and then drained it in one gulp.\n\nThe fiery liquor made his already delicate and charming face even more flushed and tender.\n\nHe was a man,\n\nyet a beauty that could spell disaster.\n\nIf this were ancient times, he would undoubtedly have been the kept favorite of many emperors and princes. Of course, even in the modern era, if he were willing, he could have had an easy and successful life.\n\nIt goes without saying how terrifying a man who could turn a straight man gay could be.\n\nAfter a long hesitation,\n\nAfter a long period of contemplation,\n\nXu Qinglang couldn't hold back any longer.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"The guy next door... the guy next door, I'll find a chance to ask him, ask him... ask him how he came back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't drunk, but his speech was a little slurred.\n\nObviously,\n\nhe knew in his heart that the man next door wouldn't just sit down and tell him the answer as if they were having a normal chat.\n\nThe process,\n\nin the end, would be somewhat unpleasant, and would require him to use certain methods.\n\nThe two sheets of human skin stopped swaying,\n\nas if in disapproval.\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it's okay. Your son will definitely bring you back to the world of the living!\"\n\n*Clack!*\n\n*Clack!*\n\nTwo pairs of chopsticks fell to the floor.\n\nXu Qinglang, holding his own chopsticks, froze for a moment.\n\nBut he still shook his head.\n\n\"No, I can't listen to you this time. Even if you disagree, I'm still going to pry his mouth open!\"\n\n...\n\n*Strangle,*\n\n*Or not to strangle?*\n\nZhou Ze was still pondering this question.\n\nHe didn't know why he was so hesitant, nor did he understand what exactly he was struggling with right now.\n\nHe was a ghost,\n\nno longer the doctor from his past life.\n\nHe was dangerous, and his situation was dire. Therefore, he knew he should nip all dangers in the bud.\n\nThis little loli was a threat to him.\n\nShe had come looking for him.\n\nShe had come of her own accord.\n\nJust like that day when her soul had sought him out to speak.\n\nShe,\n\nhad probably been watching him for a long time.\n\nEven a child understood the story of the farmer and the snake. Zhou Ze didn't think that just because he had once saved her, everything would be fine.\n\nIn fact, most of the world's hatred evolved from acts of kindness.\n\nThe nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers had already begun to slowly lengthen, and at the same time, wisps of black mist were swirling around his fingertips.\n\nSimultaneously,\n\na black luster flowed deep within Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n*I have to strangle her.*\n\n*Strangle her!*\n\nZhou Ze repeated to himself over and over in his mind. He had fought so hard for this new life; he still had a life, he still had things he wanted to do.\n\nHe still wanted to be lazy, to reminisce, to think.\n\nHe didn't want to be like the old and young on the Road to the Underworld, numb and hollow, knowing only how to walk forward step by step.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hands,\n\nand slowly moved them toward the little loli.\n\nThe little loli was reading, very engrossed, a cute and charming smile on her lips.\n\nSuddenly, she felt two fingers placed on her temples.\n\nShe asked, somewhat puzzled, \"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Just giving you a little massage, to protect your eyes.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" the little loli responded, and continued to read her book.\n\nA perfectly applied pressure came from her temples, and the little loli found it very comfortable.\n\nAfterward,\n\nthe little loli saw her uncle silently walk over to the chair behind the counter and sit down.\n\n\"Uncle, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand.\n\nThe little loli lowered her head and continued to read her book.\n\nThen,\n\n*Smack!* a crisp sound.\n\nThe little loli lifted her head and looked toward the counter again, only to see that one side of Zhou Ze's face was bright red.\n\n\"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Swatting a mosquito.\" Zhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief, then leaned back in his chair, sighing internally: *Damn it, I still can't do it. Why am I so useless?*\n\nThe little loli was apparently unaware that there were no mosquitoes in the middle of winter, but she still stood up and looked around, as if helping Zhou Ze find the mosquito.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*Keep acting,*\n\n*You've really gotten into character, haven't you!*\n\n*Still acting!*\n\n*And you're so convincing!*\n\n*Hurry up and stick your tongue out!*\n\n*Let's have a fight!*\n\n*Wouldn't it be better if you killed me or I killed you?*\n\n*Still wearing that loli face, are you betting that I can't bring myself to do it?*\n\n*I... really can't bring myself to do it.*\n\n*Fuck!*\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit helpless. He turned and went into the bathroom, turned on the tap, and splashed cold water hard against his face.\n\n\"You used to be a doctor. Saving lives was your instinct, your profession.\"\n\n\"You're a damn ghost now,\"\n\n\"Why are you still such a goody-two-shoes!\"\n\n\"Useless piece of trash!\"\n\nZhou Ze started cursing himself in the mirror.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze realized that the frequency with which he had been cursing himself lately seemed to be higher than the frequency with which he cursed Xu Le.\n\nBut the little loli, who had been sitting in the bookstore reading, put down her book at this moment.\n\nHer gaze, somewhat profound, glanced toward the bathroom door. But instead of walking that way, she walked out of the bookstore,\n\nand went next door.\n\n...\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it's no use no matter how you try to persuade me. I want you to sit here and eat with me properly. If he can be like that, I can make you like that too!\"\n\n\"We can live together as a family again, just like before.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was still muttering on.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nthe two sheets of human skin hanging by the small table began to sway frantically.\n\nA look of shock appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. He looked up at the yellow paper talismans pasted on the wall of his back room, only to find that they had, for some reason, turned gray.\n\nHe violently threw open the curtain and rushed out.\n\nHe saw a little girl, standing in his noodle shop.\n\nThe girl opened her mouth,\n\nand a long tongue shot out.\n\nVery long,\n\nvery long,\n\nfrighteningly long!\n\n\"The Underworld has its order; the dead must be on their way.\"\n\nA grim, childish voice came from the girl's mouth.\n\nThe next moment, the two human skins in the back room began to wither and decay, losing their luster and resilience. Two streams of white gas trickled out and landed beside the little girl, transforming into the figures of a middle-aged man and woman.\n\nThey swayed unsteadily,\n\nas if they had forgotten everything,\n\nknowing only to mindlessly walk step by step along the long tongue the girl had spat from her mouth, as if her tongue was their final destination, leading to some unknown place.\n\nGradually, their forms began to fade, growing more and more indistinct.\n\n\"You... you're actually... you're actually...\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed at the sweet-talking little loli he had just held in his arms not long ago, his face a mask of shock. But when he saw his parents slowly disappearing,\n\nhe immediately tried to rush over hysterically. However, his feet felt as if they were shackled, and instead of running, he fell heavily to the ground.\n\nHe stretched out a hand, pointed at his parents, and began to plead:\n\n\"Don't take them away, please don't take them away.\"\n\n\"I haven't hurt anyone,\"\n\n\"I've never hurt anyone,\"\n\n\"I just want my family to be together,\"\n\n\"They never hurt anyone either!\"\n\n\"Don't, don't, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, please...\"\n\nHowever, faced with Xu Qinglang's tearful pleas,\n\nthe little loli remained unmoved. Only after the two souls had completely vanished did she retract her long tongue, and then, she returned to her cute loli appearance.\n\nXu Qinglang felt as if two chunks had been forcibly gouged out of his chest.\n\nHis parents,\n\nhad left him for good.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot. He hammered the tiled floor with his fists, striking it fiercely.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nhe seemed to think of something.\n\nHe immediately pointed next door and roared:\n\n\"He's not human either! He's not human either!\"\n\n\"Why don't you reap him? Why don't you reap him!\"\n\n\"This isn't fair! What you're doing isn't fair!\"\n\n\"He's not human either!\"\n\n\"It's not fair!\"\n\n\"It's not fair!!!!!!\"",

    "content": "The bathroom hadn't been well-renovated by Xu Le at all; there was only a simple sink and a squat toilet, not even a showerhead. As for the second floor, never mind a bed, there hadn't even been a straw mat. It was purely used as a small storage room, because the original Xu Le went home every day.\n\nEven if at home there was a father- and mother-in-law who looked down on him,\n\nEven if at home there was a bossy sister-in-law,\n\nEven if at home there was a wife who didn't sleep with him,\n\nXu Le would still leisurely go home every night after finishing the little work there was to do at the bookstore.\n\nThis was life.\n\nYou couldn't call it dignified,\n\nNor could you say it was liberating,\n\nBut he gladly endured it.\n\nHe was a wimp, a coward, with no spirit.\n\nBecause he was Xu Le, not some great figure who had left a name in history, people thought nothing of him.\n\nIf you were to cast him in the role of some ancient historical figure, you would feel that Xu Le's life was one of great wisdom masquerading as foolishness, adding countless layers of flavor out of thin air.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't appreciate Xu Le's \"flavor.\" Having grown up in an orphanage, the feelings of inferiority in his heart, though never shown, were indeed always present. So he was sensitive, and he strove desperately. In his studies, his work, his own life, he was always the same, always insisting on being the best, the most outstanding.\n\nBut right now, looking at the wet face in the mirror, a sliver of pity appeared in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nPity for Xu Le, and at the same time, pity for himself.\n\nEveryone has their own cage; it's just a matter of the cage's style and size, but a cage there is.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to become some Ghost King, nor did he fantasize about using his special powers to command the wind and rain in the mortal world. On one hand, he knew that if he became too high-profile, something bad would probably happen to him right away. On the other hand, his previous life had been exhausting enough; he wanted to live differently this time.\n\nRegardless, he wanted to live on, to continue living in this physical body.\n\nHe spread his palm open before him. The fingernails had long since receded, showing no trace of abnormality.\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nForget it.\n\nMaybe I just deserve this.\n\nHe wiped his face and hands with a towel and walked out of the bathroom. When he re-emerged, the conflict on his face was gone, replaced by a kind of nonchalance.\n\nThe little loli was still sitting on the plastic stool, engrossed in her picture book.\n\n\"Uncle, Ruirui is thirsty.\"\n\nThe little loli called out to Zhou Ze.\n\nLike a pet fawning over its master.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, poured a cup of water, mixing hot and cold, and brought it to the little loli.\n\nThe little loli took the cup, took a sip, and her lips curved into a crescent moon smile.\n\nZhou Ze simply sat down on the tiled floor, reached out, and ruffled the little loli's head, completely at ease, without the slightest guard up.\n\nTime passed slowly.\n\nThe little loli continued to read her book.\n\nZhou Ze continued to lie beside her.\n\nOne big, one small,\n\nThey got along peacefully.\n\nThe little loli would show Zhou Ze the interesting stories she read and share them with him, and Zhou Ze would respond, explaining the deeper morals of the fables or telling her other short stories.\n\nAfter who knows how long, the red sedan pulled up again.\n\nThe girl's mother pushed open the door and thanked Zhou Ze. Her hair was exactly the same as when she had arrived. A curve formed on Zhou Ze's lips; he really wanted to suggest the woman go demand an explanation from that hair salon. You can't just fool people like that.\n\nOf course, if he really said that, the woman would probably blame him for being a nosy-parker.\n\nThe little loli bowed to Zhou Ze and said thank you, then left with her mother.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the little loli never once looked back at him.\n\nGone was gone.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the counter and picked up the gift box the woman had brought earlier. Only then did he discover a stack of cash inside—three thousand yuan.\n\nNot bad.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think about returning it.\n\nHe needed money, so he might as well use it for now.\n\nZhou Ze felt like he'd had an epiphany, like a cultivator who suddenly achieves enlightenment.\n\nBut he also felt like he was adopting a devil-may-care attitude, letting it all go to hell. Come what may, he would live as he pleased.\n\nBut no matter what, at least he felt much more relaxed now.\n\nZhou Ze casually picked up a book with a large cover from the shelf. It was an appreciation of famous calligraphers' works, the kind of thing that was purely unsellable. He had no idea if Xu Le's head had been repeatedly run over by a large iron gate to have stocked this kind of book.\n\nHe flipped it open casually.\n\nThe page happened to display the four characters for \"Rare is the gift of foolishness.\"¹\n\n\"Tsk tsk.\"\n\nZhou Ze clicked his tongue.\n\nInteresting.\n\nHe checked the time and saw it was almost evening. Remembering he had plans to see a movie with Doctor Lin that night, Zhou Ze decided to go get something to eat first.\n\nWalking next door, Zhou Ze paused, stunned to see Xu Qinglang kneeling on the floor.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot, and several empty liquor bottles lay beside him. He was currently holding another bottle, continuing to drink.\n\n\"It's not fair... it's not fair...\"\n\nXu Qinglang muttered to himself, seeming not to notice even when Zhou Ze walked into the shop.\n\n\"Hey?\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder. \"Are you alright?\"\n\nHe really wanted to remind Xu Qinglang that for other men, getting drunk might only lead to getting their wallet stolen, but if he, Xu Qinglang, got drunk and wandered outside, it wouldn't be just a matter of losing money.\n\nIn fact, if he and a showgirl were lying on a street late at night, Xu Qinglang would probably be assaulted more times than the showgirl.\n\nXu Qinglang's body trembled. He slowly raised his head, his face tear-streaked like pear blossoms in the rain, a sight to evoke pity in any heart. He made a delicate orchid-finger gesture, pointed at Zhou Ze, and said mournfully:\n\n\"Today is the anniversary of my parents' death.\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, then said, \"My condolences.\"\n\nHe waited a moment.\n\nXu Qinglang continued to drink.\n\nZhou Ze could only remind him, \"Are you not cooking tonight?\"\n\n\"I am! I'll cook!\"\n\nXu Qinglang swayed as he stood up, that willow-thin waist, so graceful and alluring, especially in his teetering state, made one want to rush over and support him, to breathe in his fragrance.\n\n\"You don't have to force yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze said this, but still sat down in a chair, ready to eat.\n\nGetting a meal wasn't easy for him, so he didn't want to look for another place.\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and walked into the back room.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of the stove igniting came from inside. Xu Qinglang was stir-frying.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and saw that Doctor Lin had just sent him a message, saying she was coming to pick him up soon.\n\nZhou Ze replied with an \"Okay.\"\n\nThinking about it, he felt that wasn't ceremonious enough.\n\nHe followed up with a \"sticker of a laughing cartoon soldier.\"\n\nThen he immediately felt that was too flippant.\n\nHe retracted the sticker.\n\nThen he thought retracting it seemed like he was trying too hard to hide something.\n\nHe replied again with a \"Hehe.\"\n\nImmediately after, he felt the two \"Hehe\"s weren't friendly enough.\n\nBut then he felt retracting it a second time would seem too pretentious.\n\nWhat a dilemma...\n\nZhou Ze was conflicted at the dinner table.\n\nThe other man, currently stir-frying, was also conflicted.\n\nIn the wok was twice-cooked pork. Once it was done, he would ladle it over rice to make a twice-cooked pork rice bowl—simple and very appetizing.\n\n\"Why didn't she take you, but she took my parents?\"\n\nXu Qinglang muttered to himself as he cooked.\n\nAs the old saying goes, one worries not about scarcity, but about inequality. This phrase explained so many truths and also exposed the darkest side of the human heart.\n\n\"This isn't fair, it really isn't fair,\" Xu Qinglang continued to mutter.\n\n\"How could you play favorites? How could you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were vacant, though the rhythm of his stir-frying didn't change. He was a good cook; cooking had practically become an instinct.\n\nSilently, Xu Qinglang took out a yellow jar from the cabinet under the stove and poured some powder from it into the twice-cooked pork.\n\n\"My parents were taken away, why are you still here? Don't tell me you saved her life?\"\n\n\"Heh, what a joke.\"\n\n\"You want to eat?\"\n\n\"Fine, I'll give you food to eat.\"\n\nXu Qinglang kept taking deep breaths.\n\n\"Is it ready yet?\" Zhou Ze urged from outside.\n\n\"Almost.\"\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a second, a flicker of panic and hesitation in his eyes, but he still put the lid on the wok. He realized he hadn't heated up his own rice in the microwave yet, so he had to reheat it.\n\nOnce the rice was hot, Xu Qinglang ladled the twice-cooked pork over it and carried the plate out.\n\nZhou Ze was staring at his phone screen, still conflicted. Seeing Xu Qinglang walk over looking dazed and lost, he put the food down and asked with some concern:\n\n\"In your state, you didn't forget the salt, did you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks, ready to eat.\n\nXu Qinglang's hand trembled. His lips parted slightly, just as he was about to speak, but Zhou Ze put his chopsticks down.\n\n\"Where's the sour plum juice or bitter melon juice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, right.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went back, got a glass of sour plum juice, and returned.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the sour plum juice first, sniffed it, then took a deep breath. Just as he was about to drink, his phone vibrated.\n\n\"I'm here, come out.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then put the sour plum juice down.\n\nHe knew that if he drank it, his face would probably be stuck in a sour expression for a long time, looking like everyone around him owed him a huge sum of money.\n\nOn second thought, forget it.\n\nCounting both his past and present lives, this was the first time he had ever asked a girl out to a movie. He should be a bit more dignified.\n\nHe couldn't help it. Originally, his quest for Doctor Lin was a beginner-level rookie mission.\n\nNow, having switched to Xu Le's skin, the rookie mission had instantly turned into a final boss-level quest.\n\nHe didn't know whether he should be secretly pleased or miserable.\n\nWhat he had to strive for now was...\n\n...to defeat himself? Only then could he win the beauty's heart.\n\n\"Put the money on my tab, we'll settle it at the end of the month. I'm leaving.\"\n\nZhou Ze got up and pushed open the door to leave.\n\nDoctor Lin's car was parked by the roadside, the window rolled down, waiting for him.\n\nAnd inside the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang's face shifted through a storm of emotions. Then he violently flung the entire plate of twice-cooked pork rice onto the floor.\n\nHe clutched his head and started crying on the ground.\n\nHe cried louder and louder,\n\nUntil finally,\n\nIt turned into dry heaving sobs...\n\n---\n¹A famous Chinese saying, 難得糊塗 (nándé hútú), which extols the wisdom of not being too sharp or getting caught up in every detail; akin to \"ignorance is bliss.\"",

    "content": "Dr. Lin got out of the car just as Zhou Ze was walking over. The two of them had a certain tacit understanding; neither spoke, silently heading toward the entrance at the other end of the mall.\n\nThis mall was already \"dead.\" Besides Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang's little shop, the only things left open were a movie theater and a buffet restaurant.\n\nOf course, due to the overall situation, the movie theater was probably also operating at a loss. On a normal day, hardly anyone went there to watch movies; you could easily buy a ticket and have a private screening.\n\nBut since it was the New Year holiday, most people were off work, and it became quite common for families to come out to see a movie together. This added a touch of liveliness, so different from the usual, to a theater that was already desolate to the point of freezing.\n\nTo Zhou Ze, however, this liveliness felt like a final flicker before death.\n\nThe great building was about to collapse; this was a case of \"under a toppled nest, no egg remains intact.\"\n\nZhou Ze went to buy the tickets, adding a couple's combo. After checking the time, he and Dr. Lin walked into the theater.\n\nBecause they had arrived a bit late and Zhou Ze had bought tickets for the earliest showtime, all the good seats were gone. Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin could only sit in the front row.\n\nIt wasn't that they couldn't wait, but there was nothing else to do in the mall. Besides, this movie, *Neon Street Detective 2*, was a 2D film, so sitting in the front row wouldn't be a huge issue.\n\nDr. Lin hadn't said much on the way over, and now she sat beside Zhou Ze in extreme quiet, gently crossing her long legs and looking up at the screen.\n\nZhou Ze offered her the popcorn. Dr. Lin waved her hand, indicating she didn't want any.\n\nZhou Ze sighed. For someone like him, who had been an old bachelor in his previous life, how to woo a girl was truly an unfamiliar subject.\n\nThe movie's comedic moments were decent. Zhou Ze would chuckle occasionally, and Dr. Lin also laughed often, but her laughs were silent—very reserved, and very beautiful.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze, the atmosphere of this movie date was still somewhat different from what he had expected.\n\nA bit bland, like something made without salt.\n\nWhen the movie ended, Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin walked out side by side. It was only seven in the evening, not late at all, but once they left the theater area, the rest of the mall was already pitch-black.\n\nDr. Lin remained silent, just walking along with him.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to say something, but he didn't know what to say.\n\nHe was the one who said he wanted to end things and say goodbye yesterday. If he acted too eager today, would she think he was a lunatic?\n\n\"Let's go to my bookstore...\"\n\n\"Let's go sit in your bookstore...\"\n\nIt seemed both were trying to break the current awkwardness and ended up thinking of the same thing.\n\nBack at the bookstore, Zhou Ze saw that the noodle shop had already closed. Its roll-down shutter, rarely ever down, was pulled shut. He had no idea if Xu Qinglang was still inside.\n\nDr. Lin picked out a magazine and sat down on a chair behind the counter. Zhou Ze also grabbed a book and sat beside her, flipping through it casually.\n\nTwo cups of hot tea sat on the counter, steam curling up from them.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt he no longer had the face to mock Xu Le. He realized that managing to make a first date this 'cultured' and 'mutually respectful as guests' was a rare feat indeed!\n\nSo rare that he felt like rewarding himself with a slap across the face!\n\n\"You're not closing now?\" Dr. Lin asked. In truth, her unspoken meaning was that she wanted to leave. After all, it was getting late; as soon as Zhou Ze closed up, she could gracefully take her leave.\n\n\"Oh, I usually open for business at night.\" Zhou Ze, however, didn't catch the subtext. He was telling the truth.\n\nDr. Lin was momentarily speechless. She could only smile, gently tucking a strand of dark hair behind her ear, and went back to looking at the book in her hands.\n\n\"Squeak...\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and two men and a woman walked in.\n\nNone of the three were very old, looking to be in their early twenties. The two men had clearly been drinking; one of them was particularly tipsy, his whole face flushed red.\n\n\"Boss, do you have water?\" the woman asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the water dispenser over by the wall.\n\nThe woman went to pour a few cups of hot water and handed them to her friends. Then she walked up to the counter and asked:\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nAs she spoke, the woman took out her phone, apparently ready to pay via QR code.\n\n\"Thirty,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"You can't rip people off like this just because it's the New Year, boss,\" the woman said with a chiding smile. \"Thirty yuan for three cups of plain water.\" But she paid with her phone anyway, then turned to her two male companions. \"Let's just rest here for a bit. Read a book.\"\n\nThey were treating the bookstore as a temporary resting spot. To them, Zhou Ze's 30-yuan charge was probably like a minimum spending requirement at a teahouse, which was understandable.\n\n\"Read a book? What kind of book?\"\n\nThe somewhat drunk man shouted, his voice a bit loud.\n\n\"I want to read ghost stories! Horror novels! Do you have any in this shop?\"\n\nThe man laughed out loud to himself as he spoke.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, took out two horror anthologies from under the counter, walked over to the man, and handed them to him, casually brushing the man's arm with his fingers in the process.\n\n*Mm, he's human, not a ghost.*\n\nTonight's date was already a failure.\n\nIf he made Dr. Lin experience another \"Night of a Hundred Ghost Stories\" like the one with the five migrant worker brothers, that would just be the absolute worst. Zhou Ze definitely didn't want that.\n\nHe's human, and that's great. He even looks cute, drunk as he is.\n\nAs for the other two, Zhou Ze didn't try to touch them; it wouldn't have been convenient.\n\nThe drunk man sat down, and his two friends, the man and the woman, also sat down on the plastic stools. The three of them played on their phones while casually flipping through the books.\n\nIt was purely to make it look like they were getting their 30 yuan's worth, at least on the surface.\n\n\"What kind of crap is this ghost story?\"\n\nThe man threw the book, and it landed right next to the water dispenser.\n\nThe woman went to pick up the book and found that because she'd spilled some water earlier, the book's cover and some of its pages were now wet.\n\n\"Boss, how much?\"\n\n\"Eighty percent of the marked price.\" Zhou Ze was actually pleased. These three young people were surprisingly well-mannered.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze was hoping the drunk man would hurry up and throw every book on his shelves, getting them all dirty. It would be a great way to clear his inventory.\n\nThe woman paid via QR code with a look of helplessness, then walked over to the drunk man.\n\n\"Let's go. Stop acting crazy.\"\n\n\"This isn't a ghost story. The person who wrote it has definitely never seen a ghost,\" the drunk man insisted stubbornly.\n\nZhou Ze let out a soft \"mm,\" thinking, *Well, you probably have seen a ghost. There's one right in front of you.*\n\n\"I'm not going back, absolutely not! I'm not planning on sleeping tonight!\" the man continued his drunken tirade. \"The moment I go home, I see a ghost. The moment I sleep, I see a ghost. I'd rather stay in this bookstore and read all night.\n\nAt least,\n\nI won't run into a ghost here!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAt this, Dr. Lin also put down her book and looked at the drunk man. Clearly, she found this matter quite interesting.\n\n\"Yo, Brother Liu, you've got a ghost in your house?\" the man who came in with him teased.\n\nThe woman shot him a look, signaling him not to talk nonsense.\n\n\"Fuck off! *Your* family has a ghost!\"\n\nThe drunk man stood up.\n\n\"Damn it, that ghost only knows how to torment me every New Year. It doesn't bother anyone else! I have three brothers and an older sister, plus my parents and my grandparents—it doesn't mess with any of them, only me!\"\n\n\"A female ghost?\" his male companion asked.\n\n\"If only it were a female ghost! It's a female... d-o-g!\"\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nBoth of the drunk man's companions instinctively burst out laughing.\n\nEven Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin lowered their heads and coughed a few times, but it was genuinely funny.\n\nEspecially the look of pure grievance on the drunk man's face when he said it wasn't a female ghost but a female... d-o-g.\n\nMy poor heart is bitter,¹\n\nAnd this baby is drunk and needs to vent!\n\n\"Every New Year, for a few days before and after, it comes for me! As soon as I fall asleep, it comes! Fuck!\"\n\nAlthough the drunk man was on a tirade, he was still in control. It wasn't scary; instead, it made him seem rather interesting.\n\n\"It started seven years ago, and every New Year since, it shows up right on time—more punctual than my parents giving me New Year's money!\" The man hugged his head, squatted down on the floor, and started to cry. \"Damn it, I can't go on living like this!\"\n\n\"What's the real story? Did you know the dog?\" his male companion asked.\n\n\"It was a dog our family used to have. It pulled out the money my dad kept under his bed and chewed it to pieces, so my brothers and I killed it and ate it.\"\n\n\"The dog must have been holding a grudge and came back for revenge,\" his companion analyzed.\n\n\"But what I fucking don't understand is why it only comes after me! When we killed the dog, it was me, my older brothers, my dad, and my grandpa!\n\nWhen we ate the dog meat, the whole family ate it together, just adding another dish for the New Year!\n\nThat dog ruined five thousand yuan; it deserved to be eaten!\n\nBut why does it only hate me?\"\n\nThe drunk man practically sobbed, \"I've asked them! My brothers, my dad, my grandpa—nothing has happened to any of them! Why does it single me out?\"\n\n\"You're drunk. Let's go, I'll take you home.\" The woman helped the man up, motioning for their male companion to help.\n\nThe group left the bookstore.\n\nThe earlier liveliness instantly vanished, replaced by quiet.\n\n\"What do you think? Why?\" Dr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze, not caring if it was true or not, simply making small talk after hearing a story. \"That dog, why does it only torment him? Is there something different about him?\"\n\n\"You're very interested in this?\" Zhou Ze asked, a little surprised.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Actually, it's very simple. With a dog, if you want to understand its thinking, you first have to put yourself in the dog's place.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Dr. Lin asked, suppressing a smile. \"It's hard to put yourself in its place.\"\n\nIndeed, how could a person adopt a dog's way of thinking?\n\n\"A dog's spirit comes back to take revenge and torment people because it has a grievance,\" Zhou Ze explained. \"That part should be the same as with humans.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't it take revenge on the other family members?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's because of the money. The dog was mischievous and chewed up part of it, but another part was probably stolen by that guy, who was young at the time.\n\nSo the dog felt it was very unfair. It tore up the money, was punished, killed, and eaten—it felt that was justified, that it deserved it.\n\nBut on what grounds,\n\ndid that person, who also stole money and made some of it disappear, get away with nothing?\n\nSo it couldn't accept it. It doesn't take revenge on the rest of the family; it specifically goes after him.\"\n\nDr. Lin shook her head, looking surprised. \"It was just a drunkard's rambling story, but after your analysis, it feels like it could be real.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over to where the group had been sitting and noticed a wallet on the floor. He picked it up and walked to the shop entrance.\n\nJust then, the female companion came jogging back.\n\n\"Excuse me, did we leave a...\"\n\nZhou Ze handed her the wallet.\n\n\"Thank you so much!\" The woman bowed to Zhou Ze in gratitude. \"If this guy went home tonight having lost his wallet and ID, his family would chew him out again.\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand.\n\nShe waved back at Zhou Ze, then turned to chase after her friends up ahead.\n\nIn the moonlight,\n\nAs the woman ran,\n\nBeneath her coat,\n\nIt looked as though a fluffy, yellow tail was swaying gently...\n\n***\n\n¹An internet slang phrase, \"寶寶心裡苦\" (bǎobao xīnlǐ kǔ), literally \"Baby's heart is bitter,\" used to express feeling wronged or miserable in a cutesy, self-pitying way.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze felt his eyes must be playing tricks on him. He had just heard a drunkard's ghost story about a dog, and with the dim streetlights, it was perfectly normal for his vision to be blurry.\n\nYes, that must be it.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't some Zhang Tianshi from Mount Longhu; he knew he was still something of a \"rotten good person.\" He couldn't change himself—otherwise, he would have extended his own fingernails to strangle that little loli during the day.\n\nAs for whether the end result would have been him getting strangled to death by the little loli or him still getting strangled to death by the little loli,\n\nthat was anyone's guess.\n\nSince he couldn't change himself, he might as well try to be less affected by this kind of bullshit. If he saw something, he should dodge it if he could, cover his eyes if he could.\n\nAnyway, that dog had been toying with that man for seven years. Counting the years,\n\nit was about time for the seven-year itch.\n\nIf that dog had really wanted to harm someone, it would have done so long ago. As for what it would get up to next, Zhou Ze couldn't care less.\n\nThe woman had come to his shop, paid for the book to compensate for the water, and had been quick with the money. That was a positive connection, and it was enough.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was discovering for the first time that there were quite a lot of unbelievable things in this world. Perhaps it was because he used to be a human and was now a ghost. Different circles meant you naturally saw the world from a different angle.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin had also walked to the shop entrance by this time.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"I'm very glad I'm not like Spider-Man, without some random elderly relative suddenly popping up to tell me:\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nDr. Lin didn't understand what that meant, but she still said, \"I should be heading back.\"\n\nIt was getting late; she really should be going.\n\n\"You won't stay a bit longer?\"\n\n\"I might have to be on duty tomorrow.\" Dr. Lin tied on her scarf.\n\n\"You can get it covered,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's not convenient.\"\n\n\"You're not willing?\"\n\nDr. Lin frowned slightly. This was the first time she had sensed such an aggressive feeling from Zhou Ze, and it left her at a bit of a loss.\n\n\"You're my wife,\" Zhou Ze said, looking very seriously into Dr. Lin's eyes.\n\nDr. Lin took a small step back. \"Yesterday, you said...\"\n\nJust yesterday, Zhou Ze had said it was over, that they would both be free.\n\n\"Yesterday was yesterday.\" Zhou Ze took a small step forward. \"Until I sign the divorce papers, I am your husband, and you are my wife. So, I want you now, to stay and keep me company a little longer!\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice grew louder and louder.\n\nDr. Lin didn't speak, just stood where she was.\n\nA nameless rage suddenly flared up in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nHe reached out, pinched Dr. Lin's jaw, and made a frivolous gesture of lifting her chin.\n\nDr. Lin looked at him, her gaze clear and calm. Especially those bright red lips, they were dazzlingly mesmerizing. She was beautiful, truly beautiful. It was the kind of exquisite face with a perfectly matching temperament that gave people a very comfortable feeling.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head directly, pressing his lips against hers in a kiss.\n\nHe kissed her fiercely, roughly, like a savage beast, the ferocity within him completely exposed! And the woman before him was the object of his taking.\n\nDr. Lin raised her hand, as if preparing to slap the man in front of her, but halfway up, her hand slowly lowered again.\n\nFrom the corner of her eye, a crystalline teardrop fell.\n\n\"What are you crying for?\"\n\nTheir lips parted.\n\nZhou Ze looked up at Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"You think your tears will make me feel guilty? You think crying will make me stop?\n\nLet me tell you,\n\ncrying won't do you any good today. You are my wife, and I am your husband!\n\nLook at your parents, what kind of trash are they? Look at your younger sister, the way she usually looks at me!\n\nAnd then look at you,\n\nyou're so noble,\n\nso aloof and beautiful,\n\nyou're a goddess,\n\nyou don't partake of the mortal world!\n\nIn the bedroom, you even sleep in a separate bed from me!\n\nYou're married, you're a wife now, yet you still pretentiously care about your chastity. Take a look at yourself, are you even worthy of it anymore!\n\nI know, I'm just an idiot. In your whole family's eyes, I'm a good-for-nothing and an idiot!\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed Dr. Lin's neck with one hand, pushed her against the counter, and then pulled off her coat.\n\n\"Today, I'm going to teach you, show you, what a wife is supposed to do!\"\n\n\"Xu Le...\" Dr. Lin didn't resist. She just looked at Zhou Ze coldly. \"You... bastard...\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze smirked, completely unconcerned, then took off his own coat and pressed Dr. Lin down onto the counter.\n\nHe was rough, he was savage.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nthe kindling had been laid, needing only a tiny flame to burst into a raging fire!\n\nShe smelled so good, her skin was so soft, her body was so full. Everything, everything was so wonderful, so intoxicating.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped his movements, stumbling back a few steps.\n\nIn front of him, Dr. Lin lay on the counter, her shirt in disarray, while Zhou Ze himself was panting heavily.\n\nNo,\n\nHow did it turn into this?\n\nDr. Lin was still lying on the counter. Her eyes were still open, and she still hadn't resisted.\n\nShe felt guilty towards Xu Le. She was a very independent and strong woman, but her social environment and the family education she had received since childhood had always left her conflicted.\n\nHer parents had threatened to kill themselves, hoping for a grandchild to be born soon, which forced her to agree to marry Xu Le. But she also held fast to her own bottom line. She had another man in her heart, even if that man had died in a car accident half a year ago, even if that man might have long forgotten her, or perhaps never even knew that a woman like her had been secretly paying attention to him for years after her internship ended.\n\nTo describe it in the critical style common in a middle school textbook: Dr. Lin had chosen to submit to feudalistic propriety in her life, yet she was unwilling to continue living like this, still holding on to her own persistence and resistance in her heart.\n\nThis was also why, despite being ten thousand times unwilling in her heart, Lin Wanqiu still didn't resist and had allowed Zhou Ze to do as he pleased just now.\n\nShe felt she had no reason to resist. Zhou Ze was her husband, and she knew her own behavior after the marriage had been unfair to her husband and to this marriage.\n\nNo acceptance, no consent,\n\nbut no resistance.\n\n\"Put on your clothes! Get your clothes on!\"\n\nZhou Ze roared at Lin Wanqiu, who was still lying on the counter.\n\nLin Wanqiu was stunned for a moment, then stood up straight, looking at Zhou Ze in disbelief. Just a moment ago, she had already resigned herself to her fate.\n\n\"I haven't even had a chance to do anything to you yet, so don't you act like you've just been violated. Put your clothes on for me,\n\nNow,\n\nImmediately,\n\nRight away,\n\nAnd then get out!\"\n\nDr. Lin silently put her clothes back on, then straightened her hem in front of a mirror. Her face was expressionless. When she was all neatened up, she poured Zhou Ze a fresh cup of hot water and placed it on the counter. Then, without even looking at Zhou Ze, she walked straight out of the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze slumped to the floor, somewhat dazed, somewhat baffled.\n\nThe warmth from her body seemed to linger on his lips and in his palms. He didn't know why he had stopped, nor did he understand why he hadn't continued.\n\nIt was obviously so pleasant,\n\nobviously so yearned for,\n\nobviously so intoxicating,\n\nbut for some reason, he felt something was wrong. It seemed... this wasn't the feeling he wanted.\n\nHe was just about to sleep with her,\n\nand she had consented,\n\nbut the scene just now was completely different from what he had wanted.\n\nZhou Ze staggered to his feet. He picked up the teacup, took a sip, and then spat out the hot water. The water was scalding, with not a drop of cool water mixed in to temper it.\n\nTossing the cup aside and letting the water wet the floor, Zhou Ze looked around, recalling his actions just now, replaying the words he had just said.\n\nHis fists clenched, then loosened, only to clench tightly again.\n\nHe went to the bathroom, turned on the faucet in the sink, and stuck his head directly under the running water to rinse it.\n\nHe needed to calm down, to become serene,\n\nnot just to extinguish the fire in his body, but also the one in his heart.\n\nA dousing with cold winter water was not something an ordinary person could endure. Zhou Ze lifted his head, feeling a wave of dizziness wash over his mind.\n\nHe looked at the mirror in front of him.\n\nIn the mirror, his own reflection stared back.\n\nZhou Ze's hands gripped the porcelain edge of the sink tightly as he gasped for breath. Then, he slowly raised his head again, and as if talking to himself, said:\n\n\"It was you!\n\n\"It was you, you goddamn bastard, you good-for-nothing!\n\nYou're influencing me, you're trying to control me,\n\nYou piece of trash, you scum, you bastard!\"\n\nZhou Ze cursed at his reflection in the mirror.\n\nYes,\n\nthat wasn't him. His behavior just now had been too abnormal. That nameless, rising agitation, that senseless daze, that inexplicable impulse,\n\nit was definitely more than just the hot-bloodedness of youth.\n\nJust now, at that moment,\n\na guy he had thought was long gone to hell, long since ceased to exist in this world,\n\nhad influenced him.\n\nHe hadn't left.\n\nHe was still hiding somewhere near him,\n\nor perhaps,\n\nhe was hiding right inside his own body!\n\nHe was a coward, he was weak. In life, he had been scorned, never daring to resist, never having the guts to lift his head. But after death, cowering in a corner, he thought he could use someone else's hands to take revenge on his wife in the simplest, most brutal way!\n\nUsing another person's power to get revenge on his own wife.\n\n\"I used to feel sorry for you, even felt a little bad for you,\" Zhou Ze muttered. \"Now I get it. Pitiful people always have a detestable side. The fact that you lived your previous life like that, all I can say is you had it coming!\"\n\n\"CRACK!\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his fist and smashed it directly into the mirror.\n\nThe mirror shattered.\n\nZhou Ze's palm was also pouring blood, which began to drip into the sink.\n\nOn the fragmented pieces of the mirror,\n\nZhou Ze's face was still reflected,\n\nNo,\n\nit was Xu Le's face.\n\nZhou Ze stood there without moving.\n\nThe person in the mirror didn't move either.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\na glint of sinister venom appeared in the eyes of the person in the mirror, who then spoke:\n\n\"Well now, you've found me out.\"",

    "content": "\"You're... asking to die.\"\n\nA black glint appeared in the depths of Zhou Ze's eyes. At this moment, he was furious.\n\nYes, he was a cuckoo occupying a magpie's nest,\n\nbut,\n\nso what!\n\nI'm going to keep living in your body, can you stop me?\n\nYour revenge,\n\nis just suddenly provoking me into forcing myself on your wife?\n\nThat's the best you can do, huh.\n\nZhou Ze spread open his right hand. Black fingernails slowly grew out, wreathed in wisps of black mist.\n\nOften, the true solution to a problem depends on where you sit—that is, your standpoint.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's standpoint, there was no way to distinguish right from wrong. He had to live. As long as his actions were based on that premise, they were all correct. Otherwise, everything would lose its meaning.\n\nIf it loses its meaning, is there any need for right or wrong to exist?\n\n\"No matter where you're hiding, I will drag you out. Even if... you're hiding inside this body!\"\n\nZhou Ze's face began to twist, and his fingernails started to dig into his own chest.\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nIntense pain was accompanied by uncontrollable convulsions. Zhou Ze shuddered all over and fell straight to his knees on the ground.\n\nHe opened his mouth,\n\nlooking somewhat dazed,\n\nNot here,\n\nNot here at all!\n\nWhy...\n\nHe had just run a test at the risk of having his own soul torn to shreds. Inside this body, there was one and only one soul—his, Zhou Ze's. Xu Le simply didn't exist!\n\nZhou Ze scrambled back to his feet. He looked into the shattered mirror; it was still his own face. This time, he waited for a long while, but the person in the mirror showed no change at all.\n\nXu Le was long gone.\n\nThen... was everything I did to Doctor Lin before driven by my own nature?\n\nNo,\n\nthat's impossible,\n\nImpossible!\n\nIt can't be.\n\nFor the first time, Zhou Ze felt that the self in the mirror was a complete stranger. It wasn't because he had changed bodies and faces, but because his own heart, his own soul, seemed completely different from his original self-perception.\n\nBody and soul—which one is the real self?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, many great poets and thinkers, both Chinese and foreign, have actually given a similar answer: the flesh will change and decay, but the soul can be eternal.\n\nIt can be noble, it can be remembered, it can shine brightly throughout the long river of history.\n\nZhou Ze also believed he was still Zhou Ze, still his original self. Right now, it was just that his body had changed, but he still considered himself to be Zhou Ze.\n\nNow,\n\nhe was beginning to feel afraid.\n\nBecause if Xu Le's soul was long gone,\n\nthat meant...\n\nthe one who had changed... was he himself?\n\n..............\n\n\"Go to sleep, dear.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll take our daughter to bed. You finish up soon and get some rest too.\"\n\n\"Alright, as soon as I finish revising this treatment plan.\"\n\nWang Ke gently twisted his neck and yawned. He was indeed exhausted, but the work at hand had to be finished. Though just past thirty, he already had many white hairs.\n\nMen at this age are in the most awkward position. If you don't strive, it's too early for retirement; if you do, your body is already starting to go downhill.\n\n*Ding dong... Ding dong...*\n\nWang Ke frowned slightly. Who would be visiting so late?\n\nHe walked to the entryway and glanced at the video monitor. Seeing a man in a black jacket standing outside, he asked, \"Excuse me, who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm looking for Wang Ke. A friend sent me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, if you have business, you can make an appointment with my assistant. I don't usually...\"\n\n\"Zhou Ze sent me,\" the man outside said.\n\nHearing that name, Wang Ke froze for a moment, then opened the door.\n\nThe man looked quite young, perhaps only twenty-five.\n\n\"Come in.\" Wang Ke gestured for the man to enter and personally brewed him a cup of tea, placing it on the coffee table.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa, looking at his old friend.\n\nHe hadn't changed. Still striving in his profession. As children who grew up together in an orphanage, they had been close since they were young. And in the old director's eyes, the two of them were the most promising children to have come from the orphanage in recent years.\n\nAt a young age, Zhou Ze was already the deputy director at the hospital, while Wang Ke had his own psychological clinic—not a small shop in some cramped location, but one next to South Avenue, in the heart of Tongcheng's city center.\n\nEven this villa was something no ordinary person could afford.\n\n\"You know Zhou Ze?\" Wang Ke asked first.\n\n\"Yes. He died half a year ago,\" Zhou Ze replied, then picked up his teacup and took a sip. He still liked Maojian tea; his taste hadn't changed.\n\n\"What do you need from me?\"\n\n\"To see a doctor.\"\n\n\"See a doctor?\" Wang Ke coughed. \"You can make an appointment.\"\n\n\"It's urgent.\" Zhou Ze looked into Wang Ke's eyes. \"Extremely urgent.\"\n\nWang Ke fell silent, then smiled, nodded, and stood up. \"Please, come with me to my study.\"\n\nRegardless of whether the sudden visit was rude or the request was abrupt, since the man claimed to be Zhou Ze's friend, Wang Ke had no reason or way to refuse.\n\nZhou Ze sat properly in Wang Ke's study for a while. Wang Ke returned, having changed into a white outfit, showing his seriousness.\n\n\"Tell me about your situation.\" Wang Ke twirled a pen in his hand. It was a dark gold fountain pen, very eye-catching under the study's lights.\n\nZhou Ze slowly shook his head. \"Don't hypnotize me, not even light hypnosis.\"\n\nWang Ke nodded and put down the pen.\n\n\"I might have... a split personality,\" Zhou Ze said, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\"Be more specific,\" Wang Ke said.\n\n\"It feels like... there's another person's personality inside my body. To be precise, at certain moments, that person's temperament will suddenly influence my actions. And I can clearly sense that those are absolutely not things I should be doing.\n\nI've always... been a very self-disciplined person.\"\n\n\"Symptoms of a split personality?\" Wang Ke's eyes narrowed. \"How long?\"\n\n\"Just recently.\"\n\n\"How about this. On this piece of paper, draw your second personality. Just go by your feelings, draw what he looks like, even if you've never seen his real appearance.\"\n\nWang Ke slid a sheet of white paper and the fountain pen over to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"The second personality?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\n\"But... strictly speaking, I *am* the second personality.\" Zhou Ze pointed to himself. \"The one causing trouble now should be this body's original personality.\"\n\nWang Ke's gaze sharpened, and he began to re-examine Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You're saying that your current state *is* the second personality?\"\n\n\"Using your terminology, yes, that should be it,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe original owner of this body was Xu Le, and Zhou Ze was the outsider. Therefore, Zhou Ze was the second personality.\n\n\"You've already killed him?\" Wang Ke asked with great interest. He seemed... somewhat excited.\n\n\"You could say that. And I'm certain he's gone,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Well, that's technically an act of murder,\" Wang Ke reminded him. \"Although legally, there's no way to judge this kind of action or classify it, I still have to sit here and condemn you.\"\n\n\"And after the condemnation is over?\"\n\n\"You came to me to find a way to completely get rid of the first personality's influence on you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWang Ke started twirling his pen again, not for hypnosis this time, but because he was thinking.\n\n\"I don't know if I should help you. From my perspective, you've killed a 'person' who originally existed. If I help you, I'd be helping you destroy the evidence, which would make me an accomplice.\"\n\n\"Help me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I need to think about it,\" Wang Ke mused.\n\n\"No need to think. Help me,\" Zhou Ze urged. Then, he added, \"Er Dan Ge.\"\n\nWhen he said \"Er Dan Ge,\" Wang Ke's expression changed abruptly. He said with some surprise, \"Zhou Ze even told you that?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nWang Ke looked up, conflicted, but he gritted his teeth, picked up his pen, and started writing on a prescription pad:\n\n\"I'll prescribe you some medication. These drugs are really just supplementary; they can help stabilize your mood and aid your sleep.\"\n\n\"Then don't bother,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The most important step is that you need a change of environment.\" Wang Ke ignored Zhou Ze's previous comment and continued speaking as he finished writing. \"Cut yourself off from the social circle the first personality lived in and build a new one for yourself.\n\n\"Many people think a person's thoughts reside only in the soul—though whether souls, or ghosts, actually exist in this world is still unknown.\n\n\"But that idea itself is inaccurate. In fact, our bodies, our muscles, our eyes, and many other parts and organs can actually store a person's 'soul.' This 'soul' is different from the soul in the broader sense.\n\n\"It refers to something like the 'muscle memory' an athlete develops through countless repetitions, as well as 'psychological suggestions' and so on. You can think of it as a kind of inertia.\n\n\"You are the second personality who killed the first. But this body, after all, was operated by the first personality for a very, very long time. It has its own inertia, its own memories. The reason you sometimes suddenly make inexplicable choices that leave you shocked and bewildered afterward, giving you the illusion that the first personality is still around causing trouble, is because of this.\n\n\"First, sever all your current social connections. Build your own social circle. Let this body begin to re-adapt to you, cancel out the previous inertia, and the problem will be solved.\n\n\"Actually, your current situation isn't serious. Your logic is very clear. Overcoming this is just a matter of time.\" Wang Ke smiled.\n\nJust then, there was a knock on the study door.\n\n\"Dear, do we have a guest?\"\n\n\"Yes, could you bring us two more cups of coffee?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of Doctor Lin, of his parents-in-law, of his sister-in-law.\n\nIt was true.\n\nIn the beginning, he had rejected that person's social circle, and had even wanted to cut ties long ago.\n\nBut since when did the fact that \"she won't sleep with me anyway,\"\n\nturn into an obsession of my own?\n\n\"How long will it take to sever the ties?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not long.\" Wang Ke shrugged, looking very relaxed. \"I've been observing you ever since you walked in. The impression you give me... how should I put it? You're a second personality, but I think you're the most thorough case I've ever seen of a second personality killing the first. It's like... a body snatching from ancient ghost stories—very clean, very neat. You could even describe it as 'perfect.'\n\n\"Right now, you can think of it as a minor side effect from a drug. You can completely overcome it with your own immunity. Maybe... two or three months, perhaps.\n\n\"After that, you can just pick up the old relationships again. There won't be any problems.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\n\"The coffee's here.\"\n\nThe study door was pushed open, and a woman walked in carrying two cups of coffee, which she placed on the desk.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the woman, and the woman looked back at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze's heart gave a jolt, and the woman's expression changed abruptly.\n\n\"What's this, you two know each other?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"Yes, he's Doctor Lin's husband, Xu Le,\" the woman answered.\n\n\"Ah?\" Wang Ke stood up in surprise and came over to shake Zhou Ze's hand in thanks.\n\nBefore, the man in front of him was a patient referred by his deceased childhood friend. Now, he was also his daughter's savior. The relationship naturally became a layer closer.\n\nZhou Ze responded perfunctorily, his mind actually wondering whether he should warn his childhood friend, who was so devoted to his career, that his wife had recently become addicted to the indescribable activity of \"getting her hair permed.\"\n\nAfter some thought, he decided it was best to warn him anonymously after he left. Although the two of them, after starting their careers, had both thrown themselves into their work and hadn't disturbed each other, knowing each other's personalities.\n\nTheir friendship and childhood memories hadn't changed, but they never had the habit of getting together for a drink or a chat when they had free time. In fact, if this problem hadn't been so thorny, Zhou Ze wouldn't have come looking for Wang Ke.\n\nHe was married, Zhou Ze didn't know. He had a child, Zhou Ze didn't know. But when help was needed, all he had to do was say his name, and the other would definitely agree.\n\nWang Ke and his wife saw Zhou Ze to the door. Zhou Ze refused Wang Ke's kind offer to drive him home.\n\n\"Dear, what did he come to see you for?\"\n\n\"To see a doctor,\" Wang Ke replied. \"You said he runs a bookstore?\"\n\n\"Yes, a bookstore that's sort of like a tea party.\"\n\n\"Alright then, I'll go have a look when I have the chance.\"\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze had just walked out of the villa's premises when he suddenly felt something. He stopped in his tracks, turned around, and looked back at the house.\n\nOn the villa's balcony,\n\nstood a little loli.\n\nShe was hugging her white teddy bear, wearing red pajamas, and standing outside in the wind.\n\nHer hair stirred and her nightgown fluttered, yet she remained perfectly still, as if she didn't notice.\n\nBut her eyes,\n\nwere fixed on him.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze's expression was grave and his body tensed up.\n\nBut gradually, the tension began to fade. The pressure from the issue with Xu Le had been relieved by their recent conversation, and Zhou Ze felt relaxed.\n\nHowever, what troubled Zhou Ze was,\n\nit seemed he didn't just have to warn his childhood friend about his wife's problem.\n\nHis daughter,\n\nit seemed, also had a problem.\n\nSilently, in the bottom of his heart, Zhou Ze felt a pang of pity for his childhood friend.\n\nWhat sins did he commit in a past life to deserve such a \"happy and blissful\" family.\n\nAt this thought, a bitter smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nThe next moment, meeting the gaze of the little loli on the distant balcony,\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand,\n\ngave a wave in her direction,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Hi.\"",

    "content": "Leaving the villa district, Zhou Ze didn't rush to hail a cab, deciding instead to take a walk alone on the night road.\n\nWang Ke had said things on his end weren't a big issue; he just needed to sever Xu Le's old network of connections. Of course, at this point, it was as good as severed already.\n\nAfter how he'd treated Dr. Lin, he figured the doctor wouldn't be speaking to him for some time. As for his in-laws' place, he hadn't been back in several days.\n\nThe only potential complication was his bookstore, since the money to open it had come from his wife's parents.\n\nHe'd let things be for now. He needed some time to cool down, too.\n\nThere was an overpass ahead. Zhou Ze walked up onto it and sat down on one of the steps, pulling out his phone and browsing idly.\n\nAs luck would have it, Zhou Ze opened that live-streaming app. Xu Le had followed many gaming and beauty streamers, but Zhou Ze wasn't interested in any of them. Scrolling down, he saw that the old Taoist streamer he had watched last time was still not broadcasting.\n\n*He hasn't streamed in so long, he's probably quit for good.*\n\nThe life of a streamer seemed easy—making money while sitting at home—but the pressure was immense. Forget one or two months of not streaming; even a few days off could make you yesterday's news.\n\nJust then, however, Zhou Ze noticed an unread message in his account. He opened it and found it was a private message from the old Taoist, sent the day before yesterday.\n\n\"This humble Taoist has come to Tongcheng, dear. Wanna meet up?\"\n\nBelow it was the old Taoist's phone number.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. Besides the message, the old Taoist had included many little heart emojis. Zhou Ze then checked the profile information for Xu Le's account.\n\nFemale account.\n\nAnd the location was set to Tongcheng.\n\nXu Le must have tried her hand at streaming before, as she had her own stream channel, though its popularity was dismal.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood where that strange feeling was coming from. The old Taoist's message was clearly looking to hook up with a fan. Having come to Tongcheng for some reason, he was casting a wide net, checking for fans in the city to see if he could score.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't interested in this old Taoist. What he was interested in was the young man who'd had trouble drinking congee, who had appeared in the old Taoist's video.\n\nNevertheless, Zhou Ze replied with his own number.\n\nStanding up and stretching, Zhou Ze prepared to leave. He was starting to miss his freezer.\n\nBut just then, his phone rang.\n\nHe picked it up. The caller ID showed a number from Rongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze answered the call.\n\n\"Hello, Benefactor, where are you!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's voice was loud, as if he were shouting into the phone's speaker. The sound of a train seemed to be in the background.\n\n\"Where are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n*Is this old Taoist incredibly idle? Doesn't he have a lot of fans? How does he manage to reply to my message so quickly every time?*\n\n*Could it be that the tag of a female fan is really that appealing?*\n\n\"Huh...\" The old Taoist was taken aback. He fell silent for a moment, not expecting the fan he planned to meet to be a man!\n\nA cute girl... with a big d*ck!¹\n\nHeartbroken,\n\nDisappointed,\n\nDejected!\n\nBut the old Taoist immediately changed his tone, wailing with all his might:\n\n\"Big brother, I'm starving! Begging for a few beers, a bite to eat!\"\n\n...\n\nTaking a taxi, Zhou Ze found the old Taoist in a hovel under a railway bridge. The old Taoist was wearing a filthy Taoist robe, his hair was disheveled, and his face was bruised. He looked for all the world like a refugee. He had been lying on a plastic sheet underneath the bridge.\n\nNearby, there was a restaurant called \"Longtan Homestyle Cooking.\" Zhou Ze ordered him two bowls of noodles, a plate of Kung Pao Chicken, and a plate of small fried fish. The old Taoist ate with great relish.\n\n\"Brother, you're a real one!\" The old Taoist finished one bowl of noodles and finally began to slow down. He then asked the owner for a warmed pot of yellow wine and smiled apologetically at Zhou Ze. He barely had any money left; Zhou Ze would definitely be paying for this meal.\n\n\"How did you end up like this?\" A glass of water sat in front of Zhou Ze. He hadn't touched any of the food on the table.\n\n\"Sigh, don't even mention it.\" The old Taoist took a sip of noodle soup, smacking his lips. \"Just a streak of bad luck. I was originally with a film crew that came to Tongcheng to shoot on location.\"\n\n\"Changed careers?\"\n\n\"I guess so. Haven't felt like streaming lately.\" The old Taoist sighed. \"A man's gotta have dreams, right?\"\n\n\"True,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This humble Taoist's future dream is to star in a *Mr. Vampire* movie, whether it's part three, four, five, or six, seven, eight.\" Speaking of his dream, the old Taoist's whole demeanor seemed to change slightly.\n\n\"And you ended up like this from being on a film crew?\" Zhou Ze asked, curious.\n\n\"Heh heh, I was actually a minor supporting actor on the crew, but who knew fate could be so fickle.\"\n\nThe wine arrived.\n\nThe old Taoist first poured a cup for Zhou Ze, then filled his own. He took a small sip, his eyes narrowing:\n\n\"Tsk tsk tsk, beautiful, just beautiful.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his plain water and took another sip.\n\n\"The assistant director is a real piece of work. Tried to pressure a young actress—the girl probably wasn't even eighteen. Sigh, the poor girl cried, she didn't want to do it.\n\n\"This old Taoist happened to see it and went up and gave that assistant director a beating.\"\n\nThe old Taoist patted his chest and said:\n\n\"Making money is making money, getting famous is getting famous, but no matter what we do, we can't go against our conscience, right?\n\n\"You tell me, buddy, isn't that right?\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze grunted. \"So you were fired?\"\n\n\"Nope, he didn't dare use that as the reason.\" The old Taoist grinned. \"Quite a few people knew I beat him up. He wouldn't dare get rid of me like that, or his own reputation would be completely ruined.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then, the next night, the young actress I'd saved walked into the assistant director's room on her own and didn't come out all night.\"\n\nThe old Taoist sounded wistful as he said this. \"They're all pitiful people, all just trying to get by.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then the young actress accused me of copping a feel, of sexually harassing her. The assistant director didn't get involved; the main director kicked me off the crew.\" The old Taoist was still smiling, but his smile held a trace of bitterness.\n\n\"Have a drink,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Come on, let's have one!\" The old Taoist raised his cup. Seeing that Zhou Ze was holding plain water, he immediately said, \"You looking down on your big brother? Let's have a drink. Your brother has fallen on hard times today, and I'm grateful for your help. The world is small; one day when I've got money again, I'll return the favor.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm allergic to alcohol.\"\n\n\"Fine then, we'll use tea in place of wine!\"\n\nThe two clinked their glasses. The old Taoist drained his in one go.\n\nLife's grievances, hardships, frustrations, and injustices,\n\nall in a single cup of wine.\n\n\"You're out of money?\" Zhou Ze asked, though the question was unnecessary.\n\n\"Yeah.\" After saying this, the old Taoist looked expectant, hoping Zhou Ze might lend him some cash. He'd had some money saved up, but he had donated it all at the beginning of the month. Now that he'd been fired from his job, he was suddenly broke.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist suddenly felt a sense of familiarity in the way this person conversed.\n\n*What the hell, you just say \"oh\" after asking if I have money? What was the point of asking?*\n\nZhou Ze stood up, went to pay the bill, and then prepared to leave. Treating the old Taoist to a meal was purely because Zhou Ze was also a bit bored tonight and wanted to talk to someone.\n\nHe could have gone back to find Xu Qinglang, but Xu Qinglang had closed up early tonight, with the roller shutter already pulled down, so he was out of luck.\n\nNow, he was tired and wanted to go back and rest.\n\n\"Buddy, you run a bookstore?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Bookstores don't make much money, do they?\" The old Taoist held out his palm, pinching his fingertips together as if performing a calculation.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"This humble Taoist thinks you'd actually make more money opening an underworld goods store.\" Seeing that Zhou Ze didn't seem very interested in his \"divination,\" the old Taoist figured, *alright, this one was raised under the red flag and doesn't give a damn about feudal superstitions,* so he gave up.\n\n\"An underworld goods store?\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Not interested.\"\n\nHe was a ghost himself; what was the point of opening a store for underworld goods?\n\n\"To be honest, this old Taoist used to run an underworld goods store back in Rongcheng.\" The old Taoist pulled a stack of bills from his pocket—it was spirit money. \"Buddy, thanks for the meal today. Your big brother doesn't have much to give you. Take this stack of spirit money. Don't be so quick to curse me out; of course you can't spend this money, but it has *yin de*² on it. Just carry it with you. Don't worry about it being unlucky; it can bring you some good fortune.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't reach out to take the money.\n\nWho in their right mind would carry a stack of spirit money on them?\n\n\"Brother, don't be a skeptic.\" Seeing Zhou Ze refuse, the old Taoist grew anxious. He pulled up his robe directly, pointing to a wound on his right chest. \"It was a stack of spirit money just like this that saved my life.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine, I'll take it.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to watch a grown man expose his chest in front of him, so he had no choice but to reach out and accept the spirit money.\n\n\"I remember from your video, there was another person in the underworld goods store. That person, he had a hard time drinking congee,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, him? He was an employee I hired. Lazy as hell. All he did all day was bask in the sun, didn't do a thing. I chewed him out every day, telling him, 'You can't be this lazy, you're still young.'\"\n\n\"Oh, does he have an eating disorder?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I guess so.\" Speaking of that person, the old Taoist seemed a bit down. \"What, is he handsome?\"\n\n\"No, I just felt a sort of kinship with him.\"\n\n\"Kinship with a ghost, my ass.\" The old Taoist sounded like he'd just heard a hilarious joke.\n\n*You feel kinship with a ghost? Don't tell me you're a ghost too?*\n\n*Hahahahahaha,*\n\n*This humble Taoist is dying of laughter!*\n\nThe two of them walked out of the restaurant. Zhou Ze offered the old Taoist a cigarette. A convenience store next door was still open, with a small fruit stand by the entrance.\n\n\"You stand here and don't move, I'm going to buy you some oranges,\"³ the old Taoist said with a grin.\n\n\"I'll just eat two, you can have the rest,\"⁴ Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What?\" The old Taoist thought Zhou Ze was a bit out of the loop and didn't get his joke. Finding it a little dull, he figured this bookstore owner must be a bookworm.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother to explain.\n\nIn fact, \"I'm going to buy some oranges, you just stand here and don't move\" is what the father says to his son in Zhu Ziqing's *My Father's Back*.\n\nZhou Ze's reply, however, was from Lao She's *Rickshaw Boy*, a line spoken by a grandson to his grandfather.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze reached out and patted the old Taoist on the shoulder. \"I'm leaving. Take care.\"\n\nJust as the old Taoist was about to say something,\n\nhe suddenly clutched his crotch.\n\nThen, the smell of burnt hair wafted out.\n\n\"Damn it, it's scalding this humble Taoist!\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **A cute girl... with a big d\\*ck!**: The original text uses `大、、、吊萌妹` (dà diào méng mèi), which is internet slang for a \"trap\" or a male user posing as a cute girl online. The literal translation is \"big d\\*ck cute girl.\"\n\n2.  ***Yin de***: `陰德` is a Taoist/Buddhist concept of merit or virtue accumulated through good deeds that go unseen or unrewarded in this life. This merit is believed to bring fortune or protection, either to oneself or one's descendants, often in unseen ways.\n\n3.  **\"I'm going to buy you some oranges\"**: This is a famous line from the classic Chinese essay *My Father's Back* (《背影》) by Zhu Ziqing. In the story, the father says this to his son before parting ways, making the gesture paternal and slightly condescending. It has become a popular meme in China used to jokingly imply one is acting as a \"father figure\" to the other person.\n\n4.  **\"I'll just eat two, you can have the rest\"**: Zhou Ze's response is a clever comeback from another famous Chinese literary work, *Rickshaw Boy* (《駱駝祥子》) by Lao She. It's a line spoken by a grandson to his grandfather. By using this line, Zhou Ze flips the script on the old Taoist, jokingly taking on the role of the \"grandfather\" and turning the joke back on him.",

    "content": "\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze frowned. Clearly, he had smelled it too.\n\n\"Nothing, I have to pee. You go on ahead!\"\n\nAfter saying this, the old Taoist priest immediately turned and ran off.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his own hand, didn't follow to ask any more questions, and instead hailed a cab back to the bookstore.\n\nThe old Taoist priest reached the side of the road and pulled a paper talisman from his crotch. The talisman had already turned red, and upon meeting the wind, it disintegrated into ash and scattered away.\n\nThis was the old Taoist's ancestral talisman. As for why it was hidden in this particular spot, that was a secret not meant for outsiders.\n\nBut the scene just now had been seared into the old Taoist's memory.\n\nOf course, looking down at his 'walnuts,'¹ which had been scorched and shriveled together...\n\n...it had also been seared onto his own flesh.\n\n\"My god, Boss, I never would've thought I'd run into your 'hometown fellow' here in Tongcheng, more than two thousand kilometers away.\"\n\n***\n\nIn the great unseen, perhaps there was a kind of connection.\n\nFor example, when Zhou Ze watched the old Taoist's livestream video, the sight of the young man sitting behind the Underworld Shop counter, struggling to drink porridge, had sparked a strange sense of empathy in him.\n\nIt wasn't just a simple case of anorexia.\n\nIn truth, they were the same kind of person.\n\nIn this world, he was not the absolute, one and only, solitary anomaly.\n\nJust as the Faceless Woman in Hell had roared in unwilling indignation:\n\n\"How can *you* leave too?\"\n\nThis meant that it wasn't just Zhou Ze; someone else had left from before the Faceless Woman in the past.\n\nAdding to that the old man with black fingernails whom Zhou Ze had treated after the car crash...\n\nThis world was truly not as peaceful as one might imagine.\n\n..................\n\nIt was already one in the morning by the time he took a cab back to the bookstore. Zhou Ze cleaned up the glass shards on the bathroom floor, then boiled a few kettles of water and gave himself a makeshift wipe-down with a towel.\n\nHe decided he would have someone come install a shower head tomorrow so he could bathe properly. For someone with a mild obsession with cleanliness, not being able to shower was absolute torture.\n\nReturning to the second floor, he set the temperature, and Zhou Ze lay down inside it, closing his eyes, ready to bid farewell to the day's exhaustion and all its chaos.\n\nHe slept soundly and peacefully.\n\nThe night passed without incident.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze first went to wash up after getting out of the freezer, then opened the shop door and glanced next door.\n\nThe shop next door was closed again today.\n\nDr. Lin was temporarily unreachable.\n\nHis wife was gone.\n\nNow he was gone too.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head sharply. *Damn it, how could I have a thought like that?*\n\n*Xu Le's lingering poison is corrupting me.*\n\n*Yes.*\n\n*That must be it.*\n\nHe hadn't eaten anything since last night, so Zhou Ze could only take out his phone and order takeout, adding a note for the restaurant to include extra vinegar.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, a young delivery guy in a yellow uniform arrived on an electric scooter. He pushed open the shop door, walked right in, and handed the food to Zhou Ze, who was sitting behind the counter reading a book.\n\n\"Thanks. It can't be easy, having to deliver food during the New Year,\" Zhou Ze said politely.\n\n\"You don't have it easy either, having to eat takeout during the New Year,\" the delivery guy shot back.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt like he'd taken an arrow to the knee. He looked up and made a point to get a good look at the delivery guy in front of him. The guy was very young, looking to be in his early twenties.\n\n\"Is this a bookstore?\" The delivery guy glanced around the shop. \"The kind where you can sit and read? How much is it?\"\n\n\"Pay what you think it's worth,\" Zhou Ze said as he opened the takeout bag.\n\n\"Alrighty then.\"\n\nThe delivery guy sat down on a plastic stool, found a copy of *Battle Through the Heavens*, and started reading with great interest.\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, chugged the vinegar the restaurant had sent. Perhaps because he'd recently been conditioned by the insane-level sour plum juice from Xu Qinglang's place, Zhou Ze felt that this ordinary vinegar didn't have much of an effect.\n\nHe then began to wolf down his food. Halfway through, a wave of nausea began to wash over him.\n\nZhou Ze clutched his own throat with both hands, forcing himself not to throw up. Finally, after a terrible standoff, the nausea slowly began to subside. Zhou Ze wiped the corner of his mouth and then started coughing heavily.\n\n\"Bro, eat slower. The way you're eating... my grandma would say you look like a reincarnated hungry ghost.\"\n\nThe delivery guy commented while still reading his book.\n\nZhou Ze shot him a glare and simply sat on the chair, panting. He needed a moment to recover.\n\n*Damn that Xu Qinglang!*\n\n*Why isn't his shop open yet!*\n\nZhou Ze decided that if the shop was still closed by the afternoon, he would have no choice but to break down the door and search for the remaining sour plum juice or bitter melon juice. Otherwise, he really wouldn't be able to get any food down.\n\nThe delivery guy seemed to have stopped taking orders, sitting there and reading his novel for an hour.\n\n\"Huh, why do I smell something like burning coal?\" the delivery guy suddenly sniffed the air, then walked out of the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think much of it. The guy probably wanted to read for a while without paying. Whatever.\n\nThis bookstore's profits really were up to fate.\n\nBut then, the delivery guy who had just stepped outside immediately opened his mouth and shouted:\n\n\"Whoa, there's a fire!\"\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze snap to attention. He also walked out of the shop, looked up, and his gaze immediately froze. On the fourth floor of the building above, thick smoke was billowing out.\n\nThat was...\n\nThe movie theater!\n\nThe only place in the formerly bustling commercial center that still had some life was that movie theater. And recently, because of the New Year's blockbusters, a lot of people had been coming to watch movies.\n\n\"Come on, let's go save people!\" The delivery guy immediately started running in that direction.\n\nZhou Ze stood there, hesitating for ten seconds. The fire was clearly large, but it definitely wouldn't burn its way down to his bookstore. He was suppressing the instinct deep inside him to rush in and save people.\n\nIn the past, he couldn't remember how many times he had rushed to the front lines of a disaster scene to participate in rescue efforts. But just recently, he had been planning to kick that bad habit.\n\nHowever, after a fierce internal struggle, Zhou Ze still ran after him.\n\nI guess...\n\n...I'm just a masochist!\n\nOn the staircase from the first to the third floor, many people were running down, while Zhou Ze ran up.\n\nAlthough this commercial center was \"dead,\" it was located in the city center, so the fire trucks should arrive quickly.\n\nThere were fewer people watching movies in the morning than in the afternoon, but the number was still considerable. By the time Zhou Ze ran up the stairs to the fourth floor, he saw that the smoke inside was much thicker, and the fire was burning eerily. Even if it was an accidental fire, it was impossible for it to be burning this intensely!\n\nBut this wasn't the time to analyze the cause. In the thick smoke, Zhou Ze saw the delivery guy, his face blackened by soot, carrying an old woman out on his back.\n\nThe guy glanced at Zhou Ze, smiled, revealing a set of white teeth, then turned his head and ran back towards the theater halls to continue rescuing people.\n\nThe fire hadn't completely spread out yet, but in the theater area, the flames were outrageous.\n\nZhou Ze didn't hesitate any longer. Since he was already here, he had to do something. He immediately ran into the thick smoke.\n\n\"*Cough cough... cough cough...*\"\n\nRushing in hastily without any protective gear was a very stupid thing to do. It was easy to fail to save anyone and end up getting yourself killed.\n\nSo Zhou Ze knew his time was limited. If he saw someone who needed help, he would just bring them out. He couldn't do much else; he could only wait for the professional firefighters to handle it.\n\n\"*Woosh...*\"\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze opened the door to Theater 2, flames shot straight out at him. Zhou Ze could only retreat to avoid the brunt of it.\n\nAnd inside, there were still sounds of crying and shouting.\n\nZhou Ze gritted his teeth and charged straight in. Inside the theater, there were flames everywhere—on the floor, on the ceiling, on the walls. And because of the confined space, the thick smoke it generated could only churn and build up in here.\n\nIn most fire scenes, far more victims die from smoke inhalation than from being burned.\n\nOnly at a time like this did people realize how important those annoying fire safety announcements before every movie really were.\n\nAs soon as Zhou Ze rushed in, he saw two people lying in the small space of the aisle.\n\nOne was an adult man in a black suit. He was on the ground, coughing, clearly unable to get up.\n\nThe other was a boy of about ten years old, lying unconscious on the ground. It was impossible to tell if he had just passed out or had already suffocated.\n\n\"Save me... save me... save...\" The man in the suit managed to lift his head and look at Zhou Ze standing before him.\n\nZhou Ze jumped right past him, hoisted the little boy onto his back, and prepared to rush out.\n\nHe was already feeling dizzy. Clearly, without a gas mask or other professional equipment, he couldn't last much longer either.\n\nHowever, just as he was about to run out with the boy on his back, Zhou Ze felt a tug on his ankle. His entire body fell to the ground, and the boy on his back tumbled off.\n\n\"Save... save... save me first... I'll... give you... money... save... me first...\"\n\nThe man in the suit used the last of his strength to grip Zhou Ze's ankle. He knew he couldn't hold on much longer. He couldn't breathe at all right now; his lungs felt like they were on fire.\n\nHaving been tripped, Zhou Ze felt the world spin, and he almost passed out. Instantly, he bit down hard on the tip of his own tongue, forcing himself to stay conscious.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nZhou Ze used his other foot to kick the man's hand and head.\n\nAfter several kicks, the man finally let go.\n\nZhou Ze staggered back to his feet, put the boy on his back again, and rushed out of Theater 2.\n\nWhen he burst through the billowing smoke and into a safe area, Zhou Ze's knees gave out, and he fell directly to them. The boy on his back fell off, but because Zhou Ze had instinctively cushioned the fall, it wasn't serious.\n\nThe firefighters had already arrived and were beginning to extinguish the fire. Another group of firefighters in full gear was rushing into the blaze.\n\n\"There's still someone in Theater 2,\" Zhou Ze said, grabbing the uniform of a firefighter running past him.\n\n\"Okay, got it,\" the man nodded and charged into the fire.\n\n\"*Huff... huff... huff... huff...*\"\n\nZhou Ze lay sprawled on the tiled floor, gasping for air. Across from him, the delivery guy, whose yellow uniform had been stained black, was also leaning against the wall, panting. The two made eye contact and both managed a weak, exhausted smile.\n\nParamedics had also arrived—a group of doctors and nurses in white. Zhou Ze no longer had the strength to look for Dr. Lin among the rescue team.\n\nGritting his teeth, he got back up. Zhou Ze glanced at the boy who was receiving emergency treatment from a doctor. The boy's chest was still rising and falling; he should be fine.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze saw several other people being carried out by firefighters. Some were saved, some were not. The man in the black suit was lying motionless on a stretcher; he was probably gone.\n\nZhou Ze didn't feel guilty. He had no reason to feel guilty.\n\nHe was doing a good deed, saving people, but who he saved first was up to him. No one had the right to guilt-trip him.\n\nBesides, at that moment, he simply didn't have the ability to carry a child while also hauling an adult man out. If he had tried, the only result would have been him dying in there too.\n\nThe body he had possessed was Xu Le's, a \"scholar\" with no strength to even tie up a chicken, not Arnold Schwarzenegger's.\n\nWhat's more, that guy had almost gotten him killed in the theater.\n\nHe struggled to his feet and refused the help of a nurse who wanted to check his condition. Zhou Ze walked to a restroom at the other end of the building, turned on the faucet, and vigorously scooped up cold water with his hands to splash his face.\n\nFinally, he had caught his breath.\n\nHe lifted his head.\n\nZhou Ze looked at himself in the mirror.\n\nSuddenly, he noticed something.\n\nIn the mirror, behind him, a faint human figure was slowly appearing.\n\nThis person...\n\n...was wearing a black suit.\n\nHis face was contorted with venomous hatred as he stared at Zhou Ze.\n\nHis mouth was open, screaming ceaselessly, as if questioning him about something, hysterical and frantically agitated.\n\nAfter a person dies, under specific circumstances, there is a certain probability they can transform into a vengeful ghost to seek revenge.\n\nRight now, this man had just died. His soul was still in the stage of becoming a ghost; it would likely fully form around his *touqi*.²\n\nHe wasn't a ghost yet, just a prototype.\n\nBut because of Zhou Ze's own special nature, he could perceive the man's existence ahead of time.\n\nHe hated him.\n\nFor not saving him.\n\nAnd this hatred was so strong...\n\n...that it was turning him into a vengeful ghost!\n\n\"Heh, interesting.\"\n\nZhou Ze smirked.\n\nHe lowered his head back into the sink and continued to splash his face with water.\n\nAt the same time, he sighed inwardly:\n\n\"Heh, people...\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  `核桃 (hétáo)`: Literally \"walnuts,\" used here as slang for testicles.\n2.  `頭七 (tóuqī)`: The \"seventh day head.\" In Chinese tradition, this is the seventh day after a person's death, when the soul is believed to return home for a final visit before moving on to the afterlife. It's considered a crucial time in the soul's transition.",

    "content": "According to the *Jianghai Evening News* (a local Tongcheng newspaper), seven people lost their lives in the cinema fire, and more than thirty others were injured to varying degrees.\n\nA week had passed. The cinema had been shut down, and it was impossible for it to reopen anytime soon. It was even likely that the theater would be abandoned for good. It had been losing money from the start, so naturally, they wouldn't go through the trouble of a grand reopening.\n\nWith that, the commercial center complex was basically pronounced dead.\n\nOver this period, Zhou Ze hadn't contacted Dr. Lin again. Both sides maintained a tacit understanding not to interfere with each other, each living their own life. His father-in-law and mother-in-law, however, had called several times, questioning why Zhou Ze wasn't coming home, asking if he'd gotten brazen, and so on.\n\nEventually, Zhou Ze simply blocked their numbers.\n\nThe current headache was that the money for the bookstore had come from his in-laws. When you take someone's money, you lose your nerve.¹ Zhou Ze just couldn't figure out a way to earn some money so he could open a new store and be truly independent.\n\nAll he could say was, the foundation Xu Le had left him was just too poor.\n\nSeveral media outlets had contacted him, hoping to interview Zhou Ze about his heroic deed and promote the \"positive energy\" of the new era. Zhou Ze had refused them all.\n\nHe had no interest in that kind of fame. As the saying goes, a tall tree catches the wind. Given his identity and situation, turning himself into some kind of celebrity would only create more uncontrollable dangers.\n\nFor the past week, business had been lackluster. Daily sales were less than a hundred, not even enough to cover rent and utilities. Zhou Ze, however, wasn't too concerned about that.\n\nWhat he *was* concerned about was his next-door neighbor, Xu Qinglang. His door hadn't been open for a week.\n\nZhou Ze had hired an unscrupulous locksmith to open the lock. He went inside and searched, but couldn't find any of that sour plum juice. The kitchen in the back room had been tidied up and was spotless and neat.\n\nIt was truly hopeless.\n\nA man who owned over twenty properties and was also very handsome,\n\nif he suddenly saw through the vanities of the world and decided to go chasing the wind,\n\nyou would have a very hard time finding him.\n\nAnd because of that, Zhou Ze's week had been quite miserable.\n\nChili oil,\n\nAged dark vinegar,\n\nDark soy sauce,\n\nHigh-concentration orange juice—he'd tried them all. And while they helped him choke down some food, the experience was always torturous, a far cry from the effectiveness of Xu Qinglang's family-recipe sour plum juice.\n\nAs night fell, Zhou Ze squatted alone at the entrance of his bookstore, a cigarette dangling from his lips. He would glance next door from time to time, radiating a sense of desolate solitude.\n\nBy the roadside in front of the shop, four or five sticks of pagoda incense were burning. The people from the shopping center had set them up. According to custom, today was the day to welcome the God of Wealth. Even though they knew the God of Wealth could hardly save this shopping center, the customary gestures still had to be made.\n\nWhat if a miracle happened?\n\nOccasionally, Zhou Ze would look at his own reflection in the glass behind or in front of him.\n\nThe vengeful ghost of the man in the black suit was continuously taking shape. Tonight was his *touqi*,² and it should be almost complete.\n\nThe materialization of a vengeful ghost was an event with an infinitesimally small probability to begin with. Besides, an ordinary vengeful ghost could, at most, make you trip while walking or bite your tongue while eating. Making you sick enough to need an IV drip for two days would be considered an impressive feat for a ghost.\n\nThe kind of thing you see in movies, with vengeful ghosts running rampant and killing indiscriminately, is simply impossible in reality. Otherwise, the mortal world would have descended into chaos long ago.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, who had returned to life in a borrowed body, was keeping such a low profile.\n\nHow dare those dregs, who didn't even have a physical body, come out and try to act tough?\n\nOver the past week, when he had nothing to do, Zhou Ze would read, daze off, trim his nails, and incidentally check if the vengeful ghost behind him had gotten any clearer.\n\nIt had a bit of a... nurturing feel to it. He was experiencing firsthand that \"a father's love is as steadfast as a mountain.\"\n\nDaddy loves you,\n\nDaddy’s waiting for you to grow up.\n\nZhou Ze could clearly sense the emotions of the one behind him. His greatest hatred was not directed at the cause of the fire, but at Zhou Ze himself. He was venomous, he was furious, he was expectant, he was waiting.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nin his mind, tonight, the day of his *touqi*, was his moment for revenge.\n\n*Yinquesiting.*³\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette. Once the ghost had fully formed, Zhou Ze would teach him why the flowers are so red.⁴\n\nRegarding the rescue, Zhou Ze didn't feel he had done anything wrong. He also didn't feel the man in the suit was wrong for hating him.\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had encountered a similar situation: a person was drowning, and someone went in to save them. In the end, the rescuer was grabbed so tightly by the drowning person that they both drowned.\n\nGenerally speaking, when you rescue someone from the water, you have to approach them from behind. If you go from the front, it's easy for the drowning person to clutch you like their last saving straw.\n\nOf course, he could understand it.\n\nBut understanding would not be a reason for Zhou Ze to allow the man in the suit to run rampant in his bookstore at midnight.\n\nDuring the day, Zhou Ze ordered takeout. He chatted a bit with the new delivery guy and learned that the one who had helped with the rescue had recently become famous. Not only was he attending all sorts of award ceremonies, but he had also been praised and rewarded by his company. He now had a nickname: \"The Most Handsome Delivery Guy.\" He was still delivering food, but now he did it while livestreaming, and his popularity was very high.\n\nWhile eating his meal and chugging aged vinegar, Zhou Ze casually scrolled through Weibo and actually saw the delivery guy on the trending topics list.\n\nIt had been a week since the incident. The narrative had shifted from initial processing and summarization to the current phase of developing and promoting positive energy. The topic was at its peak, and its influence had spread not just through Tongcheng, but across the entire country.\n\nAt eleven o'clock that night, Zhou Ze was watching a movie while also watching the man in the suit slowly become more solid. The movie was called *That Demon Within*, a work from a few years prior by the well-known director Dante Lam, starring Daniel Wu and Nick Cheung.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. The delivery guy, in his uniform, walked in holding a selfie stick.\n\n\"This is a bookstore I often come to. After a busy day of deliveries, I always come here to read. It's not for any profound learning, I just simply like to read.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the delivery guy took a copy of Wen Tiejun's *Eight Crises* from the shelf.\n\nThe book was about China's modern economic crises. The delivery guy opened it, sat down on a plastic stool, and began to read with great relish.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that the last time he came, he had read two volumes of *Battle Through the Heavens*.\n\n\"Alright, that's all for today's stream. I want to read quietly for a bit. Everyone, please get some rest. Thanks for keeping me company all day.\" The delivery guy bowed to his phone screen.\n\nA barrage of subscriptions, airplanes, and rockets flooded the screen. His popularity was indeed terrifyingly high.\n\nAfter turning off his phone, the delivery guy closed *Eight Crises*, stretched, looked at Zhou Ze, and said,\n\n\"Boss, let's go grab a late-night snack. My treat.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and pointed at his computer screen.\n\n\"What are you watching?\" The delivery guy moved closer and, after looking at the screen, smiled. \"I've seen this movie. *That Demon Within*, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Zhou Ze nodded, simultaneously glancing at the time in the bottom-right corner of the screen. It was almost twelve.\n\nThe \"baby\" behind him was already getting impatient.\n\n\"Didn't any reporters try to interview you?\" the delivery guy asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You really should've accepted. It would've been good for your bookstore's business.\"\n\n\"I prefer the quiet.\" Zhou Ze disingenuously put on an act.\n\n*Money is important, but my life is more important.*\n\n\"You can watch the movie later.\" The delivery guy seemed to have taken a liking to Zhou Ze. After all, they were companions who had charged into a fire together.\n\nThere was a certain...\n\nsense of camaraderie.\n\n\"You know,\" Zhou Ze began, \"*That Demon Within* is based on a true story. The real protagonist's name was something like Tsui Po-ko.\"\n\n\"Heh, I had no idea,\" the delivery guy said with a bashful smile. \"It's just a movie. Who pays attention to that stuff?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right.\" Zhou Ze closed his laptop and stretched. \"It's so late. What do you want to eat?\"\n\n\"Anything's fine.\"\n\n\"I'll just order some takeout then.\"\n\n\"No, let's eat out. My treat. Takeout's no good. Let me tell you, the back kitchens of some of those places are disgusting. Some businesses don't even have a real storefront, they just rent some rundown place and cook there. Tsk, tsk. I wouldn't dare eat it, anyway.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"By the way, do you know what happened with Tsui Po-ko?\"\n\n\"Won't I know once you tell me?\"\n\n\"He killed his own colleague, pocketed the money, and then lived a carefree life. He even appeared on TV shows. He liked showing off, being famous.\" Zhou Ze rubbed the tip of his nose. \"A very complicated person. He really enjoyed being on camera.\"\n\nThe delivery guy was silent for a moment, then changed the subject. \"Boss, are you coming for a late-night snack or not?\"\n\n\"I don't really want to. Can't you see all that pagoda incense outside my door? I've been smelling it all day. It's completely ruined my appetite.\"\n\nPagoda incense refers to those large incense candles that are taller than a person, stacked layer upon layer like a pagoda. They are very thick and can burn for a long time.\n\n\"Haha, but there's no smell in your shop at all,\" the delivery guy said, pointing at the central air conditioning unit above Zhou Ze's bookstore. \"That's an air purifier, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it was installed with the AC. And I like to spray some air freshener in the bookstore. After all, you have to create a good atmosphere for reading, right? Since I don't offer coffee or pastries, the least I can do is provide a pleasant scent.\"\n\n\"So, Boss, you're still not going to do me this honor?\" the delivery guy said, pretending to be annoyed. \"We've been through life and death together, you and I.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand. \"You know, there's something I've always been curious about.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That day, I didn't smell anything at all. In my shop, it's very difficult to smell anything from outside. Almost impossible. How did you smell the fire that day?\"\n\nThe delivery guy froze, his expression turning a little unnatural, but he brushed it off. \"My nose has been sharp since I was a kid. My grandma used to say I had a dog's nose. When I was little, I was great at sniffing out hidden snacks at home.\"\n\n\"Do you know what day it is today?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"What day?\"\n\n\"*Touqi*.\"\n\n\"*Touqi*?\"\n\n\"That's right. The *touqi*... for the seven people who died in the fire!\"\n\n***\n\n¹ A literal translation of the idiom 吃人家嘴軟拿人家手軟 (chī rénjiā zuǐ ruǎn ná rénjiā shǒu ruǎn), meaning it's hard to be assertive toward someone you are indebted to.\n\n² *Touqi* (頭七), the \"first seven.\" The seventh day after a person's death, considered a critical time in Chinese tradition when the spirit of the deceased is believed to return home one last time.\n\n³ Internet slang, a phonetic play on the English word \"interesting.\"\n\n⁴ A popular Chinese phrase originating from a song, meaning to teach someone a harsh, unforgettable lesson.",

    "content": "The delivery guy stood still, looking across the counter at Zhou Ze, who was seated behind it.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. The store doesn't have any cameras, and I don't have a voice recorder,\" Zhou Ze said, stretching languidly. \"Of course, you definitely won't believe me when I say that. Tsk, suit yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by that,\" the delivery guy said, very calm.\n\nA person who could do such a thing would have to be very calm.\n\nThe police had yet to specifically identify the arsonist, and that was a testament to his talent—used in the pejorative sense, of course.\n\n\"I am absolutely certain that you were the one who set that fire.\" Zhou Ze spread his hands. He was simply stating a fact, one that required no debate.\n\n\"You're drunk,\" the delivery guy said.\n\n\"Not drunk.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Based on just that, you're saying I set the fire? Are you better than the police?\" The delivery guy's expression began to tighten, but he was still restraining himself.\n\n\"Hsss... Of course I'm not better than the police, but I'm not blind. As for saying I concluded you were the arsonist based on that, I'm sorry, but that's not it at all.\n\nI first confirmed you were the arsonist, then worked backward to find the evidence, just to get a taste of what it's like to be Conan.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed behind the delivery guy.\n\nThe delivery guy immediately spun around, thinking the police were standing there, but there was no one, and no sound of sirens.\n\nIn this nearly abandoned mall, deep in the night, there wasn't even a single person passing by.\n\n\"They... they all came in with you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who?\" The delivery guy frowned.\n\n\"The six people who died in the movie theater. They followed you in, and as soon as I saw that, I went 'Oh,' so it must be you. It's a dead giveaway.\n\nAside from the goofball standing behind me who's hell-bent on hating me,\n\nyou can't possibly say the other six victims all identified the wrong killer, can you?\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, looking at the delivery guy before him.\n\n\"Stop with the ghost act!\" the delivery guy practically roared. He didn't know why, but he felt the pressure on him growing, and a cold sweat began to break out on his face.\n\n\"Don't be nervous. They can't hurt you.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the counter, holding a plastic bag.\n\nInside the plastic bag were small boxes of rice and some pickled vegetables.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's line of sight, six people were sitting on plastic stools. There were men and women, two of them elderly.\n\nThey all sat there quietly and properly, reading books, not making a sound.\n\nIn front of each person, Zhou Ze placed a bowl of rice topped with pickled vegetables, with a pair of disposable chopsticks stuck upright in the rice.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze took out a bottle of baijiu that cost less than 10 yuan and used the plastic cups from the water dispenser to pour a cup for each of them.\n\n\"Fellas, life isn't easy for me either. This bookstore is always losing money, so this is all I can treat you to. Don't blame me for being stingy, alright? You're dead, but I still have to keep on living.\n\nAnyway, your families will be making offerings to you, so you won't miss this little bit from me, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze bent over, speaking as casually as if he were serving regular customers.\n\nAnd yes, as for that brain-damaged goofball behind him, Zhou Ze wasn't kind enough to leave him a portion.\n\n\"Are you fucking nuts!\" The delivery guy couldn't hold it in anymore. \"Heh, I should really record this, post it online, and let all my viewers see what you're really like!\"\n\n\"You dare?\" Zhou Ze turned sideways. \"You say that as if you really would. You've only been streaming for a few days. Even 55kai went down.\"¹\n\nYes, there were many reasons the police hadn't found the arsonist yet, but if they had a primary suspect to investigate, it would be very difficult for the arsonist to remain hidden.\n\n\"I'm leaving. You've got rocks in your head.\"\n\nThe delivery guy's pleasant demeanor vanished. He had successfully converted his fame into a streaming career and was earning a huge income, not just because he was a \"hero,\" but also because of his own marketing strategy.\n\nHe was very down-to-earth, and his established public image was a good one. Building on that, he made livestreaming his food deliveries—something that should have been tedious and boring—into something people found fascinating to watch.\n\nHe knew he was panicking, he was flustered. So, he wanted to leave, to escape this bookstore.\n\nHe regretted coming here today, regretted it very, very much.\n\nZhou Ze didn't try to stop him. However, just as the delivery guy reached out to push open the bookstore's door,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, checked the time, and said:\n\n\"It's midnight.\"\n\n\"Dong!\"\n\nThere was no clock in the bookstore, but at that moment, the delivery guy seemed to hear a bell toll.\n\nHe pushed the door with all his might, but it didn't budge an inch. Furious, he glanced at the lock. It wasn't locked, and there was nothing blocking it, but the door just wouldn't open.\n\nThe delivery guy started frantically kicking the door, but it remained motionless.\n\nWhat he couldn't see was that,\n\nthe six people who had been sitting there reading,\n\nhad all slowly risen to their feet.\n\nThe seventh-night return of the soul,²\n\nEvery injustice has its perpetrator, every debt its debtor.\n\nThey had come here, following their enemy,\n\nand now,\n\nthey were all staring intently at their killer,\n\nthe man who had become a hero for setting the fire that killed them.\n\n\"I'll show you for not saving me!\"\n\nA low growl came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze happened to blow on his fingernails at that exact moment. Then he spun around abruptly, the nails on his right hand instantly growing long. A translucent blackness emanated a strange luster, and wisps of black energy coiled around his fingertips, carrying a terrifying aura.\n\nAt the same time, a black mist roiled within Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n\"Hssssssss... AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe man in the black suit, who had just struggled to transform into a vengeful spirit, was grabbed by the shoulder by Zhou Ze's hand. He immediately began to tremble all over as the black energy from Zhou Ze's fingertips pierced his body like countless sharp knives. Wisps of green smoke rose up from the crown of the black-suited man's head.\n\n\"I understand you, but you disgust me.\"\n\nZhou Ze said in a low voice,\n\n\"So, you can just say bye-bye.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingers tightened.\n\nThe black-suited man, wailing, revealed a pleading expression. He hoped Zhou Ze would spare him. He had already become a vengeful spirit; if he \"died\" again, his soul would be scattered to the winds, without even a chance to enter hell.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't let go,\n\nhis gaze remaining ice-cold.\n\nOnly after the black-suited man's body had completely melted and evaporated clean away,\n\ndid he withdraw his hand. In his palm, faint traces of ash could be seen.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nZhou Ze blew on his palm, then clapped his hands together.\n\nTurning back around, Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nHe didn't know if it was because of his presence here that the spiritual dynamics of the bookstore had changed,\n\nor if,\n\nthis was just a coincidence.\n\nThe six customers, who had previously entered and read quietly, were now starting to emit a black mist from their bodies—a sign they were about to transform into vengeful spirits to seek revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the delivery guy was still relentlessly slamming his fists and feet against the wall.\n\n*As they say, Heaven spares no one.* Perhaps this scene was a perfect illustration of that.\n\nThese six victims had also been panicked and disoriented in the thick smoke and raging fire, ultimately failing to escape and dying a horrible death.\n\n\"Everyone, do me a favor. Don't be in such a hurry to become vengeful spirits.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked into their midst, holding up a hand to the six of them.\n\n\"Come on, relax a little. How about a smile for your bro?\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to ease the tension. Once they turned into vengeful spirits, they could no longer enter the cycle of reincarnation. After taking their revenge and completely losing their lingering attachments, they would simply dissipate with the wind.\n\nIt was the most tragic of endings.\n\nZhou Ze felt it wasn't worth it, truly not worth it.\n\nThe arsonist had already caused your deaths, separated you from your family and loved ones forever. Your children lost a father or mother, your parents lost a child.\n\nThere was no need to push yourselves into an even more terrifying abyss because of the same killer.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze's words had no effect at all.\n\nThe six people's faces remained ice-cold, and the black mist on their bodies grew denser. Black markings began to spread from the corners of their eyes and lips.\n\nThey were about to look just like that goofball in the black suit had when he charged at him.\n\n\"Since you won't smile for your bro, how about your bro smiles for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze forced a very ugly smile.\n\nIt's over.\n\nWhat a tragedy.\n\nThere's no saving them now.\n\nZhou Ze knew that making these vengeful spirits scatter into nothingness would be easy for him—just like the goofball who had been following him for a week, who got slapped out of existence the moment his cooldown ended and he was about to unleash his ultimate move.\n\nBut as for guiding these ghosts to the afterlife, he really had no idea how to do it. Besides, Zhou Ze himself was a ghost; it wasn't a suitable job for him, like asking Zhang Fei to do embroidery.\n\n\"The Netherworld has a path, the Yellow Springs can be crossed!\"\n\nA sharp cry came from outside the store. Then, the bookstore door was pushed open, and Xu Qinglang walked in. He held a small porcelain bowl containing grains of rice, with three sticks of incense stuck inside.\n\n\"Rise!\"\n\nThe three incense sticks burned down rapidly.\n\nAt the same time, the grains of rice in the bowl turned from a crystalline white to black, while the black mist on the six people began to fade. Finally, their expressions shifted from their initial cold, murderous look to one of peace and serenity.\n\nThe six people slowly sat back down in front of their respective bowls.\n\n\"Xu Qinglang!\" Zhou Ze shouted, pointing at him.\n\nHe was excited.\n\nTruly excited.\n\nMore excited than when he saw Doctor Lin coming out of the bath.\n\nThinking about how difficult it had been for him to eat this past week,\n\nhow could he not be excited!\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang's earlier performance, Zhou Ze wasn't surprised. In truth, they had all just been maintaining an unspoken understanding.\n\nXu Qinglang shot Zhou Ze a look—in an instant, it was full of a thousand charms, as if all the azaleas on a mountain had bloomed at once—but at the same time, he said irritably:\n\n\"What are you doing here, hosting a Lunar New Year's midnight party?\"\n\n\"It's not what I wanted,\" Zhou Ze said, briefly explaining the situation to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded to show he understood, then clasped his hands and bowed to the six people.\n\n\"Everyone, it is the seventh-night return of the soul. You should go back and see your loved ones. They should be at home waiting for you. As for what happened here, I will give you a proper accounting.\"\n\nHearing this, the six people silently passed through the glass and left.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze, however, was on the bowl of \"black rice.\"\n\n\"How come this stuff has no effect on me?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth twitched. He fought back the urge to erupt and fight Zhou Ze for three hundred rounds, huffing:\n\n\"You're different.\"\n\nHe was still angry, still held a grudge against Zhou Ze, still felt it was unfair. But because of his handsome features, his temperament, and his voice, that phrase, \"You're different,\" carried the deep, sorrowful resentment of a lady in her boudoir.\n\nNext,\n\nXu Qinglang looked at the delivery guy, who had fainted from fear and was curled up in a corner. \"What should we do with him?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Xu Qinglang made a throat-slitting gesture.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Better to hand him over to the state.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"55kai\" (五五開, Wǔwǔkāi) was the nickname of Lu Benwei, an extremely popular Chinese livestreamer who was banned from streaming platforms in 2018 for misconduct.

    "content": "周澤最後報了警，警察很快來了，按照周澤的說法，是說這位外賣小哥來到自己店裡後忽然發了瘋，說有很多被他燒死的人亡魂來找他復仇，然後不停地對著牆壁狂踹狂砸最後暈厥了過去。\n\n\n\n  從警局做完筆錄出來時，天都已經亮了，影院縱火案，一波三折，但現在至少打開了局面，之前警方很可能只是因為燈下黑的緣故，沒有懷疑到見義勇為的外賣小哥身上，現在哪怕還沒有確切的證據，但只要真的將目光落在對方身上進行查找，應該很快就能發現真相。\n\n\n\n  至於之後輿論的轉向，網上吃瓜群眾的顛覆以及那些曾給這位外賣小哥刷禮物的目瞪口呆，就不是周澤需要擔心和思考的問題了，他能做的，也就只有這麼多，願意做的，也就只有這麼多。\n\n\n\n  鬼的事兒，還是交給鬼來解決，人的事兒，還是交給警察來解決為好。\n\n\n\n  站在警局門口，呼吸著清晨新鮮的空氣，頭腦頓覺清醒。\n\n\n\n  打車回到店裡時，周澤看見隔壁許清朗的店已經重新開門營業了，許清朗本人換了一身平常點的衣服坐在店鋪門口一邊擇菜一邊曬著太陽，嘴裡還哼著「童子戲」（地方曲種）小調，悠哉悠哉，自有一股子風流韻味流淌出來。\n\n\n\n  一切，\n\n\n\n  仿佛依舊。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到店裡，許清朗拍了拍手，問道：「吃啥？」 \n\n\n\n  「隨便吧，我要酸梅汁。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗點點頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤在店裡坐了下來，手指輕輕地敲擊著桌面。\n\n\n\n  不一會兒，許清朗端上來一碗雞蛋面，麵湯清澈，麵條筋道，當然，這些都不重要，最重要的是，熟悉的酸梅汁，又出現在了周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「給我做一桶吧，多少錢？」周澤指了指店裡的飲水機水桶，「先做一桶。」\n\n\n\n  「等過陣子吧。」許清朗在周澤面前坐下來，嘴裡叼著一根煙，他似乎很想做出一副小痞子抽菸吊啊吊的姿態，但偏偏給人一種「女人抽菸也能這般美麗」的違和感。\n\n\n\n  他不娘，也不gay，只能怪老天給錯了皮囊。\n\n\n\n  就著酸梅汁吃完了面，破天荒地，這次吃碗麵後周澤的噁心感不再那麼強烈了，但依舊多喝了好幾杯水緩了緩。\n\n\n\n  「記得林黛玉初進賈府吃飯後遇到什麼事兒麼？」許清朗吐出一口煙圈問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤想了想，明白了過來。\n\n\n\n  林黛玉初入賈府，第一頓家宴，飯畢後，下人送上茶湯，林黛玉在家裡被父親教導過飯後不宜飲茶容易消化不良，但見賈母和諸多姐妹都喝了，她也只能跟著一起喝。\n\n\n\n  「我能吃飽了就行。」周澤搖搖頭，以他現在這個情況，很可能這輩子是做不成一個老饕或者美食家了，至於消化問題，再說吧。 \n\n\n\n  「我心裡有些不平衡。」許清朗開門見山地說道，「我父母，走了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗父母早就走了，但周澤清楚許清朗這次說「走了」是什麼意思，應該是下去了。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼忽然就走了？」周澤問道，本想回應一個「節哀」，想想，不合適。\n\n\n\n  「被發現了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤拿煙的手微微一抖，\n\n\n\n  被發現了？\n\n\n\n  周澤記得那個老者在臨死前，也曾喊過「他們發現我了！」\n\n\n\n  許清朗看著周澤，「我很不甘心，也很不平衡，為什麼她帶走了我父母，卻不帶走你。」\n\n\n\n  「他？她？」周澤腦海中浮現出了那個小蘿莉的形象，再結合許清朗那日的狀態和晚上的離開，就猜出了七七八八。\n\n\n\n  「她，不可能吧。」\n\n\n\n  「陰司有序，亡者上路！」許清朗壓低了聲音，盯著周澤的眼睛，「長舌化路引，深喉許幽冥，熟悉麼？」\n\n\n\n  「黑白無常？」\n\n\n\n  「那只是一個統稱。」許清朗嘆了口氣，「但他們確實是執法者，遊歷陽間，肅清秩序，將人和鬼，區分開來。人有人間道，鬼有奈何橋。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  周澤還是有些不太相信，如果小蘿莉真的是白無常那種的身份，那她之前在校車上顯露出真身吐出長舌頭導致車禍和那位司機的死亡該怎麼算？ \n\n\n\n  「她沒帶走我，反而帶走你父母，所以，你恨我？」周澤伸手指了指自己。\n\n\n\n  「對。」許清朗點頭道。\n\n\n\n  「那這面里沒下毒吧？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  「沒下毒吧？」周澤又問道。\n\n\n\n  「沒。」許清朗回答。\n\n\n\n  「那就好。」周澤並不知道，在那天的回鍋肉蓋澆飯里，飯菜里是下了毒的，若不是那天林醫生來得早了一些，可能自己真得吃下那頓飯。\n\n\n\n  「你是真傻還是假傻？」許清朗有些沒好氣地看著周澤，「她為什麼不抓你？」\n\n\n\n  「對啊，她為什麼不抓我？」周澤也問道。\n\n\n\n  「我問你呢！」許清朗提高了聲音。\n\n\n\n  「我也不知道。」周澤攤攤手，「可能，是因為我救了她一次吧。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  兩個人的談話，最後以菸頭燒滅了作為終止符。\n\n\n\n  雙方這次算是開門見山了，打破了原本的那種默不作聲地默契。\n\n\n\n  周澤走回自己的店裡，收拾地上的塑料板凳時，卻發現有六張塑料板凳下面都貼著厚度不均的冥鈔。\n\n\n\n  這是看書錢還是吃飯錢？ \n\n\n\n  周澤記得前陣子那個開直播的老道也曾給自己一沓冥鈔，說是能積攢陰德，那麼，他的那些冥鈔就是以這種方式弄來的麼？\n\n\n\n  他是怎麼弄過來的？\n\n\n\n  周澤將冥鈔都收集起來，整整一沓，手感不錯，沒有平日裡見到的那些冥鈔的粗糙，摸在手裡，有絲綢的觸感。\n\n\n\n  這讓周澤想到了老道所說的冥店，和鬼做生意，最好的店鋪當然是冥店，因為那裡賣的東西，也都是給死人的。\n\n\n\n  也因此，如果自己手中現在拿的冥鈔是死人的「鈔票」，那麼開冥店，肯定能比自己賺得更多。\n\n\n\n  腦海中，再次浮現出視頻畫面里坐在櫃檯後面艱難喝粥的男子，\n\n\n\n  周澤忽然覺得，\n\n\n\n  自己好像發現了一件可能會很有趣的事情。\n\n\n\n  當然，再有趣的事兒，現在也沒精力去管了，昨晚一宿沒睡，現在既然回來了，就得好好地補一個覺。\n\n\n\n  周澤將書店捲簾門給拉了下來，上了鎖，不知道為什麼，他的書店正在變得晚上開門的時間比白天多，或許，自己以後有機會可以再訂做一個牌子，\n\n\n\n  叫\n\n\n\n  「深夜書屋。」\n\n\n\n  反正白天也沒什麼生意，書店也一直在虧損著，自己可以隨意地玩一些噱頭，搞一些事情，最爛最壞的結果也不就是現在這個樣子唄。 \n\n\n\n  外賣小哥的事兒是罪大惡極的錯誤，但也給周澤一些啟發。\n\n\n\n  衛生間的洗澡設備已經被裝了起來，周澤買的是電熱水器，脫去衣服，周澤洗了一個澡，換上了一套干整的衣服上了樓。\n\n\n\n  當周澤彎下腰準備調置冰櫃溫度時，整個人卻愣在了那裡，\n\n\n\n  因為在他面前的冰櫃裡，\n\n\n\n  躺著一個人。\n\n\n\n  對方閉著眼，像是陷入了沉睡，呼吸平穩，雙手交叉放在胸前，有著一種小大人似地安逸。\n\n\n\n  很平靜，也很可愛，\n\n\n\n  前提是，\n\n\n\n  她的舌頭如果不會變得那麼長的話。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉，\n\n\n\n  把自己的巢穴給鵲巢鳩占了。\n\n\n\n  周澤很想大喊一聲，讓隔壁的許清朗同學過來復仇。\n\n\n\n  但想想還是算了，不是他覺得把許清朗喊來復仇是害了他，而是他認為許清朗也沒那個膽子過來復仇，說不定人家來了他還會親切地問候一聲：\n\n\n\n  「您醒了啊？\n\n\n\n  您想吃點什麼？\n\n\n\n  我給您去做。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉睜開了眼，她的眸子很深邃，不再是以往見面的清澈和單純。 \n\n\n\n  對方伸出手，周澤幫忙把冰櫃蓋子打開。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉從裡面坐起來，周澤注意到了，她其實沒有設置溫度，只是選擇了一個通風換氣。\n\n\n\n  「你躺在這裡，不冷麼？」坐在冰櫃裡的小蘿莉開口問道，沒等周澤回答，小蘿莉又開口道：「哦，我忘了，你不一樣。」\n\n\n\n  說完，坐在冰櫃裡的小蘿莉伸手輕輕拍了拍自己身邊的空位置，一臉天真無邪地看向周澤：\n\n\n\n  「一起睡不？」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手想要揉一揉這個女孩兒的頭，但手在旁邊，卻停了下來。\n\n\n\n  她是黑白無常一類的存在，是陰司在人間的執法者。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉伸手，她的小手抓住了周澤的大手，把周澤的手按在她的頭上，然後按著周澤的手在自己頭上來回揉了揉。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「你，很好。」小蘿莉終於從冰櫃裡站起來，但似乎因為腿短的原因，爬出來有些困難。\n\n\n\n  周澤將她從冰櫃裡抱出來，\n\n\n\n  也不知道她之前是怎麼躺進去的。\n\n\n\n  「你，很好。」小蘿莉伸手指著周澤，「重複道。」\n\n\n\n  「額……謝謝。」周澤不知道該如何回復了。 \n\n\n\n  「我要走了。」小蘿莉轉過身，背對著周澤，雙手交叉負於身後，周澤知道她是想表現出一種高山仰止的氣質。\n\n\n\n  但她的問題和許清朗一樣，\n\n\n\n  老天給錯了皮囊。\n\n\n\n  她這個樣子，怎麼都覺得好可愛。\n\n\n\n  憋住，\n\n\n\n  不准笑。\n\n\n\n  周澤在不停地提醒自己，\n\n\n\n  這是黑白無常老爺，\n\n\n\n  不准笑！\n\n\n\n  哈哈哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  但還是忍不住啊！\n\n\n\n  作死了哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  完蛋了哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  憋得越狠笑起來就越誇張，連眼淚都滴出來了。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉沒理會周澤的笑聲，也沒治周澤一個大不敬之罪，\n\n\n\n  只是問道：\n\n\n\n  「你想，接替我麼？」",

    "content": "\"Do you... want to take my place?\"\n\nThis question left Zhou Ze stunned.\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nGoing straight from an undocumented resident hiding all over the city to a local civil servant?¹\n\nThe surprise came so suddenly, Zhou Ze was almost afraid to accept.\n\nMeat pies do fall from the sky, but most people who encounter them end up getting smashed to death by the pies.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze didn't think that saving her life warranted this kind of treatment.\n\nAfter all, the business with that driver still hadn't been cleared up. This little loli was adorable, yes, but that was just a facade.\n\nXu Qinglang had said she once appeared in his shop, expressionlessly stuck out her tongue, and took away the departed souls of both his parents.\n\nNo matter how Xu Qinglang cried and begged, she remained completely unmoved.\n\nWith someone like that, you couldn't hope for her to repay a kindness. You should just be thankful if she didn't turn around and bite you.\n\nAs an Underworld Emissary, how many joys and sorrows, partings and reunions had she seen?\n\nHow much of humanity's evil?\n\nHow much of the ghosts' venomous resentment?\n\nShe wasn't an innocent little girl. She couldn't possibly be.\n\n\"What, not talking anymore?\" the little loli asked again.\n\n\"I don't know what to say. Are you just asking casually?\" Zhou Ze asked cautiously.\n\n\"You can say no,\" the little loli said.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nThe little loli added, \"And then, I'll drag you down below.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAlright, then.\n\nIsn't this much more comfortable?\n\nWho needs a multiple-choice question?\n\nA fill-in-the-blank is just fine.\n\nThe question was basically: write \"Y\" for the answer, or you get shot.\n\n\"I agree,\" Zhou Ze replied. This time, there was no hesitation, no more struggle.\n\nThe little loli turned, a guileless smile on her face. Then, she walked slowly over to Zhou Ze and, trying to act like a little adult, went to straighten his collar.\n\nIt seemed to be a gesture a superior might make to show favor to a subordinate, much like an ancient emperor granting a minister the chance to dine with him.\n\nBut the little loli was too short. Standing before Zhou Ze, she couldn't reach his collar; she could only help him adjust his belt.\n\n\"Pick me up,\" the little loli pouted, commanding him.\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked the little loli up.\n\nThe little loli reached out and straightened Zhou Ze's collar. Then she frowned, seeming to find being held by Zhou Ze like a daughter somewhat inappropriate.\n\n\"Do I look silly like this?\"\n\n\"You look very cute.\"\n\nThe little loli raised her small hand, intending to slap Zhou Ze across the face.\n\nIn that instant, the nails on the hand Zhou Ze was using to hold her rapidly grew long and black, and a black vortex swirled in the depths of his eyes.\n\nThe little loli stopped, a meaningful smile playing on her lips.\n\nZhou Ze made no further move either.\n\n\"Do you have any idea how foolish it is to show anger and defiance in front of me?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"Doesn't matter. I'm already someone who's died once.\"\n\n\"That's because you were lucky! You only walked a short stretch of the Yellow Springs Road before you left. You never experienced the pain and torture of the journey to Hell!\" the little loli cried out. \"‘It’s better to live a bad life than to die well.’ That is by no means an empty platitude.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\"Put me down.\"\n\nZhou Ze put the little loli down.\n\nThe little loli leaned back slightly, looking at Zhou Ze. \"Do you know why I chose you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Because you're very smart. Or rather, you're very calm and know your place,\" the little loli said, ticking off her fingers. \"The Underworld has its order, and the living world has its laws. There are quite a few stowaways who come out for all sorts of reasons, but you're the most peaceful one I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that's the real reason,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The real reason, I don't feel like telling you.\" The little loli stretched languidly. \"I'm tired and want to go down below. So, I happened to run into you, and you won't cause me too much trouble, so I picked you.\n\nHeh heh, a while back in Rongcheng there was a guy who made a huge ruckus. He was clearly just a pitiful stowaway, yet he styled himself a judge. As a ghost, he ridiculously tried to exercise his own judgment in the world of the living. Tell me, wasn't he an idiot?\"\n\n\"An idiot,\" Zhou Ze replied. Immediately, he recalled that the old Daoist priest had seemed to be from Rongcheng. \"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"He was taken care of.\"\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, her face a picture of innocence. \"The rules are flexible, but for those who cross the line too far, there's no hope left at all.\"\n\n\"Did he die?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I mean, was he dragged back to Hell or was his soul annihilated?\"\n\nHearing this, a trace of anger flashed across the little loli's face, as if he had struck a nerve.\n\n\"That is something you don't need to know.\"\n\nThe little loli took Zhou Ze's hand, placing her small palm against his.\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze felt a searing heat in his palm. When the little loli moved her hand away, Zhou Ze saw a black rune had appeared in the center of his palm.\n\nThe rune was not complex; it looked like an eye.\n\n\"The Underworld has its order; the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" the little loli said very seriously. \"Those who should go down, you send them down. Those who should be dispersed, you can disperse them directly.\n\nOf course, if you want to play the hero and right the wrongs you see,\n\nthat's fine too.\n\nBut you'll have to bear the cost yourself.\n\nIf you screw up, you deal with the consequences.\"\n\nThe little loli yawned, as if she were tired.\n\n\"You said you're tired, so how long will you be resting? Am I... just filling in for you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"We'll see when I get back,\" the little loli said, preparing to go downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze pressed on, \"So what do I do? Go out on patrol every night?\n\nFind ghosts?\n\nAnd then...\n\ndeal with ghosts?\"\n\n\"The door is in your hands, you figure it out. You can keep running your bookstore. You're a ghost, a ghost that has returned to life in a borrowed corpse. Those unclean things and other miscellaneous riffraff will naturally flock to you.\n\nTo them, you're a candle in the dark, and they are the moths.\n\nAlso, after I left that mark on you, it's like I upgraded you from a candle to an incandescent light bulb, bright enough to blind them.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli went downstairs, and Zhou Ze followed.\n\n\"I'll read for a bit, then I'll be leaving. This body's mother will be coming to pick her up soon.\"\n\nThe little loli sat down on a plastic chair and casually picked up an illustrated book to flip through.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside her, not to wait on her, but because he had a few questions to ask.\n\n\"Go on, ask,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"Is there... a salary?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"You know, my business here loses money.\"\n\n\"The economy is in a slump. Money from the living is getting harder and harder to earn,\" the little loli lamented.\n\n\"It really is,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Then earn money from the dead.\"\n\n\"Dead people's money can't be spent,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"That's because your method is wrong.\" The little loli held out her hand. \"Bring me some spirit money. The kind... given by the dead.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out a stack of spirit money and placed half of it in the little loli's hand.\n\n\"You've earned quite a bit,\" the little loli remarked with a sidelong glance.\n\nZhou Ze didn't mention that half of it had been given to him by the old Daoist priest from Rongcheng. For some reason, Zhou Ze had a feeling that letting this little loli know about it would bring him trouble.\n\nHolding the money, the little loli pushed open the bookstore door and crouched down by the side of the road.\n\n\"Lighter.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed her the lighter.\n\nThe little loli burned the spirit money, and the ashes were quickly blown away by the wind.\n\nThen, she stood up and dusted off her hands. \"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood there, a bit bewildered by the wind.\n\n\"Is this an advance deposit into my account at the Underworld bank?\"\n\n\"Just wait and see. This place of yours... still doesn't have enough human traffic.\" The little loli and Zhou Ze, one big and one small, stood waiting by the shop entrance for about half an hour.\n\nThe little loli's delicate face was turning red from the wind. Zhou Ze wasn't bothered by the cold, but standing there by the roadside staring like a pair of idiots felt very strange.\n\nFinally,\n\na pot-bellied man walked past them. As he did, a wallet fell from his pocket. The man didn't notice at all and kept walking.\n\nZhou Ze went over and picked up the wallet. He found several thousand yuan inside, along with an ID card, bank cards, and other things.\n\n\"Should I return it to him?\" Zhou Ze asked tentatively.\n\nThe little loli burst out laughing.\n\n\"That man has done something unconscionable. This is him losing wealth to avert disaster. You deserve this money.\"\n\nThe little loli pushed the door open and went back into the bookstore. She rubbed her hands together; clearly, the half-hour outside had chilled her considerably. It was much warmer inside.\n\nZhou Ze walked in holding the wallet, asking in disbelief, \"He won't call the police?\"\n\n\"That money won't burn your hands. You can take it,\" the little loli said, a hint of impatience in her voice.\n\n\"Fine. So next time I'm short on cash, I just burn some spirit money at the door, and someone will come deliver money to me?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but he found it interesting.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked over, carrying a large bottle of sour plum juice.\n\n\"Hey, these are all the ingredients I have in the shop, this is all I could make. For the rest, you'll have to wait...\"\n\nXu Qinglang pushed the door open and immediately saw the little loli sitting there. He stumbled, and the bottle in his hand fell to the floor, shattering.\n\nSour plum juice splashed all over the bookstore floor.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, signaling him to keep his composure.\n\nThe little loli seemed to completely ignore Xu Qinglang.\n\nIndeed, a person who was merely lucky and knew a thing or two about the supernatural wasn't worth a second glance from her.\n\n\"Whose daughter is this? So cute, hahahaha! Here, little one, Uncle has a tank of little goldfish at home. Want to come home with Uncle and see them?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's laugh was painfully awkward, completely forced.\n\nThe little loli simply spat out one word: \"Scram.\"\n\nXu Qinglang forced another smile, then turned and went back to his own shop.\n\n\"Do you think I'm being unreasonable?\" The little loli looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"A little,\" Zhou Ze said honestly.\n\n\"Then let me tell you something else. The driver's death... that was just because I was bored sitting on the school bus, so I revealed my true form to play a little joke.\n\nDoes that make you think,\n\nI'm even more unreasonable?\"\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze with a blank, adorable expression.\n\n---\n¹公務猿 (gōngwùyuán) is a pun on 公務員 (gōngwùyuán), the word for \"civil servant.\" The character for \"servant\" is replaced with one that sounds the same but means \"ape,\" a common self-deprecating slang term for office workers.",

    "content": "\"Is that too much?\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't answer that question. Whether the little loli was telling the truth or not, he had no standing to question her further.\n\nIt was frustrating, but it was the truth.\n\nAlthough he'd heard from the little loli of Chengdu about that \"fellow\" in her city—the one who, as a ghost, attempted to be the judge of the mortal world—and Zhou Ze felt both admiration and reverence for him, his end was also a lamentable one.\n\nWhen you lack the capital and the power to stand on the same level as your opponent, you don't even have the right to an equal conversation. What right do you have to question them?\n\n\"How boring.\" The little loli shook her head, but then she smiled. \"But that's precisely what I admire about you.\"\n\nThe little loli continued to hold the book in both hands, looking as if she were about to fall asleep. She murmured, \"You're the most self-aware person I've ever met.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nWas that a compliment or an insult?\n\n\"I have to go.\" The little loli was getting sleepier and more fatigued.\n\n\"I have one more question. Eating and sleeping—are there no other solutions or ways to improve the situation?\" This was the question Zhou Ze most wanted to ask, the problem he was most desperate to solve.\n\nSince returning to life by borrowing a corpse, he could blend perfectly into society except for these two issues.\n\n\"In terms of stability, a custom-built computer is never as good as the original,\" the little loli said, shaking her head weakly. \"As for sleeping, unless you have a creature of yin from Hell by your side to provide you with an environmental magnetic field similar to Hell's, you simply can't rest.\n\n\"You're originally a person of Hell. Lingering in the mortal realm is like being unable to acclimate to a new place—the most severe case imaginable. Because you're a bit special, you can still rely on special methods to manage. Others can't sleep at all. Half a year without sleep would drive them insane, drive them to their deaths!\n\n\"So, you're already considered lucky.\"\n\nThe little loli let out two weak chuckles. \"If I weren't going back, you could have held me while you slept.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for eating, I still can't get used to the food of the mortal world.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the little loli's head tilted to the side, and she fell directly into a deep sleep. Zhou Ze reached out and steadied her. Seeing that she was still breathing and her body was normal, he let out a sigh of relief.\n\nZhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he could naturally tell the girl was fine.\n\nThis little one was Wang Ke's daughter; he couldn't just stand by and watch something happen to her.\n\nHowever, what disappointed Zhou Ze was that the scene of the little loli's departure was a bit too ordinary.\n\n\"Shouldn't she have vanished into the ground with a *biu*? Does just falling asleep count as going back?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIt wasn't grand, and there was nothing to see. It was like drawing a talisman on his own palm; there was no sense of ceremony, no flair.\n\nThe little loli in his arms suddenly opened her eyes and said, \"Fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment. She was pretending to be asleep!\n\nThe next moment, a cloud of yin energy so thick it seemed about to condense into water droplets surged from the little loli's body. Even with the central air conditioning on, the temperature in Zhou Ze's bookstore plummeted in an instant.\n\nThe door was closed, but gusts of cold wind whipped through the room, accompanied by the sound of book pages flipping.\n\nA vast shadow covered the area, like the awakening of a ferocious beast, bringing with it a pressure that only ghostly beings could perceive.\n\nStimulated by this, Zhou Ze's fingernails grew long again, and he felt a surge of adrenaline as if the power within his body was responding to hers.\n\nThen, it was truly a—\n\n*Biu*—\n\nAll the yin energy instantly rushed into a single point in the ground.\n\nIn a flash, the clouds dispersed, the mist vanished, the temperature returned to normal, the sun shone down.\n\nIn that daze, it truly seemed to echo the line:\n\n*Like birds, their food consumed, returning to the woods; leaving a vast, white, empty land, so truly clean!¹*\n\n***\n\nIn the evening, Xu Qinglang brought dinner. The sour plum juice was gone, replaced by bitter melon juice.\n\n\"The sour plum juice is gone. You'll have to make do with bitter melon juice for now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said with some embarrassment. When he saw the little loli during the day, he had been scared out of his wits.\n\nIn truth, he understood that he was a coward and quite useless.\n\nWhen his parents were taken away by the little loli, he didn't dare to seek revenge or even resist. He could only kneel there and beg like a weakling.\n\nMoreover, he had even taken his anger out on Zhou Ze, trying to poison his food.\n\nNow, Xu Qinglang had come to terms with it. So what if he was a coward? He was just a minor mystic who happened to have Yin-Yang Eyes because of his physical constitution. He truly didn't have the guts to face an underworld official from Hell.\n\nIn fact, the little loli could have punished him for privately keeping his parents' souls from moving on—deducting his mortal lifespan or even dragging his soul back to Hell.\n\nShe had treated him like a fart in the wind and let him go.\n\nThere was no need for him to keep making a fuss.\n\nThe dead can't be brought back to life, and his previous actions had indeed gone against the way of heaven.\n\nZhou Ze finished his meal and placed a thousand yuan in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"This is for the previous meals, plus future ones. Let me know when it runs out.\"\n\n\"Oh, came into some money?\" A faint smile finally appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. He then pushed the money back toward Zhou Ze and said softly, \"Life isn't easy. Don't be a spendthrift. You have to think of the household.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I'm a man with over twenty properties. I don't care about this little bit of money.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to say that he would soon be rich too. As long as he earned more money from the dead and then played around burning spirit money at his door, some idiot would throw their wallet at his storefront like a wealth-scattering boy.\n\nBut then Zhou Ze thought again.\n\nEven if he burned a truckload of hell money, he probably couldn't burn his way to over twenty properties, could he?\n\nUnless an armored car had an accident right in front of his shop...\n\n\"I'm planning to change locations. What about you?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"Anywhere is better than here.\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"I plan to move the noodle shop down to the county seat. The scale will be smaller, but at least it'll be more popular.\"\n\n\"I'll think about it,\" Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n\"Alright, I'm heading out.\"\n\nXu Qinglang collected the bowls and chopsticks and left the netherworld store.\n\nZhou Ze trimmed his nails while looking at the symbol on his palm. It was evening, and no customers had arrived yet. Zhou Ze felt a little anxious. Before, when he saw no hope, he just muddled through one day at a time. Now that he saw the dawn of making money, his motivation had naturally kicked in.\n\n*What's going on, still no customers?*\n\n*Didn't she say I was an incandescent light bulb? That I could blind their ghostly eyes?*\n\n*Come on!*\n\n*Were they all blinded and got lost?*\n\n*Creaaak...*\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and two women walked in.\n\nOne was very young, about the same age as Zhou Ze (Xu Le), and the other looked to be almost fifty, likely a mother and daughter.\n\nZhou Ze recognized the young woman.\n\nShe was his first customer since opening. He remembered she had a corgi with her last time. She had sat and read for a while and even left him a hundred yuan, his first earnings.\n\nThis time, however, the woman didn't have her corgi. She had brought her mother instead.\n\n\"Here, sit here. Be careful, check if there's anything dirty on it,\" the older woman said to the girl.\n\nThe girl bent down, took out a tissue, wiped the plastic stool, and then sat down dejectedly.\n\n\"Pick up a book and read, dear. There are no problems that can't be solved, no hurdles in life that can't be overcome. Try to look on the bright side,\" the older woman coaxed from the side.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The girl sighed, her expression still downcast. She clearly hadn't taken the words to heart.\n\n\"Dear, grab a book. When you read, you'll forget about time.\" The older woman crouched beside the girl, continuing to coax her, the very picture of a loving parent.\n\nZhou Ze continued to trim his nails, paying them no mind.\n\nJust then, the girl looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"Sir.\"\n\nThe girl's voice was soft, her appearance pitiable, as if she had just gone through a breakup and was at her most vulnerable.\n\nOf course, to a seasoned pro, this was the easiest time to slip in and make a move.\n\n\"You're the owner, right?\" the older woman said, looking at Zhou Ze like a protective mother hen.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" the older woman said warily. \"Honey, ignore him.\"\n\nThe girl was silent for a moment, but finally spoke up.\n\n\"Beibei is missing.\"\n\nBeibei must be the corgi's name.\n\n\"Missing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, missing.\" The girl's eyes were red, and tears welled up again as she thought of her beloved dog. \"I was cleaning the house, and he slipped out without me noticing.\"\n\n\"If it's lost, it's lost. We can just buy another one. What are you crying for?\" the older woman consoled.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked over.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" The older woman pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You'll find him,\" Zhou Ze said, ignoring the woman and comforting the girl.\n\n\"Mm.\" The girl cried, then reached out and hugged Zhou Ze's shoulders.\n\n\"You scoundrel! She lost a dog, not her man! What are you getting involved for!\" The older woman looked ready to rush over and hit Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Is there a place for you to speak here?\"\n\nA black glint flashed in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThe older woman immediately let out a shriek and crumpled to the ground, too scared to run her mouth any longer.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" the girl asked, lifting her head in confusion. She didn't know who Zhou Ze had just been talking to.\n\nZhou Ze let go of the girl. When a person's spirits are at their lowest, the three protective flames on their body are at their weakest, making it easy for unclean things to latch on.\n\nFortunately, this woman, perhaps lonely for too long and fond of nagging, wasn't a bad person at heart.\n\n\"I posted a lost dog notice online. I want to find him,\" the girl said, taking out her phone to show Zhou Ze a picture of the dog.\n\n\"Sir, have you seen him?\"\n\nZhou Ze gave a bitter smile. Business here was so bleak that people barely came, let alone dogs.\n\nBut the woman who had been scared into a heap on the floor by Zhou Ze suddenly shouted:\n\n\"I've seen that dog! I've seen that dog! It was right in my neighborhood!\n\n\"I couldn't stand being at home while my husband was... with that little vixen, so I went for a walk in the neighborhood to clear my head. I saw someone walking that dog!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A famous line from the classic Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*. It describes the fall of a great family, signifying a sudden and complete end where everything vanishes into nothingness.",

    "content": "\"Where is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Xingfa Residential Community. A man and his daughter were walking it, I remember,\" the woman said with great certainty. \"I even knew that man when I was alive, I even argued with him! He actually tried to take advantage of this old lady back then, tried to hit on me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and warned, \"If you're lying to me or trying to pull some ghostly trick like borrowing a knife to kill someone, I'll make sure you can't even continue on as a ghost.\"\n\n\"How could I, big brother? I may be dead, but I'm still a good person. Go ask around my old neighborhood, who doesn't say that Sister Hong is a kind and warm-hearted person?\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, signaling for her to be quiet.\n\nThe girl didn't know who Zhou Ze was talking to; of course, Zhou Ze's voice was also very low, as if he were muttering to himself.\n\n\"I think a friend once told me that a family in Xingfa Residential Community has a dog that looks a lot like this one. You should go there and ask,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Really? Okay, I'll go right now.\"\n\nThe girl finished speaking and took out her wallet, preparing to pay.\n\n\"Forget it, no charge.\"\n\n\"I should pay. Thank you for the information, boss.\" The girl took out five hundred yuan and insisted on stuffing it into Zhou Ze's hand.\n\n\"Let's wait until you've found the dog,\" Zhou Ze said, still refusing the money.\n\n\"Well then, thank you, boss.\"\n\nThe girl wiped her tears and left the bookstore.\n\n\"Such a good girl,\" the woman said, still sitting on the bookstore's tiled floor.\n\n\"You can get lost now too.\"\n\n\"Big brother, I finally found someone who can hear me speak. Can't you just keep your big sister company and chat a little longer?\"\n\nThe woman looked as if she'd been holding it in for a very, very long time.\n\n\"No time.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat back down behind the counter, picked up his nail clippers, and continued trimming his nails.\n\n\"Big brother, with your bookstore in this location, I'm afraid you don't get much business, do you?\" the woman said, still trying to make conversation.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly seemed to remember something and asked, \"Want to go down?\"\n\n\"Down?\" The woman froze, seemingly not understanding.\n\n\"To the place you're supposed to be right now.\" Zhou Ze had just remembered that he was apparently still a part-time Ghost Emissary.\n\n\"Can I not go down?\" the woman asked, looking troubled. \"My son is taking the college entrance exam¹ this year. I want to stay with him until it's over before I go.\"\n\nAh, the piteous hearts of parents everywhere.\n\n\"If your son knew his dead mother was still keeping him company while he studied at night, he'd surely be moved to tears,\" Zhou Ze quipped.\n\nMoved to tears was probably unlikely, but being scared into an illness and completely bombing the exam was a very real possibility.\n\n\"I'll just watch from the side,\" the woman said, somewhat aggrieved.\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, not bothering to say more. When the little loli had assigned him the job, she had said that unless he deliberately overstepped his bounds to act as some kind of judge, he could otherwise act according to his mood.\n\nBesides, the little loli hadn't given him any performance reports or quotas for how many ghosts he had to collect each month or quarter.\n\n\"Big brother, how did you become human?\" the woman asked curiously.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThe woman's body trembled several times in a row, and she immediately dared not speak again.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the woman muttered to herself that her son should be getting back from his evening self-study session, and she left the bookstore.\n\nAfter she left, Zhou Ze specifically walked over and flipped the stool she had just been sitting on. He didn't see a single piece of spirit money.\n\n\"A woman who knows how to live frugally, indeed.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed, wondering if he was too good-natured.\n\nHe was, at the very least, a temporary Ghost Emissary, someone within the system. How dare you show up empty-handed and leave empty-handed?\n\nDo you really not see a temp as an official?\n\nPushing open the door, Zhou Ze stepped out of the bookstore, took out a cigarette, and lit it. Next door, Xu Qinglang seemed to have just finished cleaning up. He walked out wearing an apron, glanced at Zhou Ze, then squatted down next to him and bummed a cigarette.\n\nThe two men squatted in a row.\n\nBehind them was a nearly dead commercial center; in front of them, an empty road.\n\n\"That little girl's mother came to pick her up?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"She went down,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, she went down.\" Xu Qinglang exhaled a puff of smoke. \"Once you go down, it's hard to come back, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zhou Ze said, shaking his head.\n\nJust as the little loli had said, when he had gone to Hell, he had only walked a short stretch of the Road to the Underworld before coming out. He had never experienced the true terrors of Hell.\n\n\"What is Hell really like?\" Xu Qinglang asked, blowing a smoke ring.\n\n\"I don't really know.\"\n\nThere wasn't much else to talk about, but going back to their respective shops felt even more boring. After finishing their first cigarette, they both naturally lit a second.\n\n\"What about that wife of yours?\" Xu Qinglang asked, hitting a sore spot.\n\n\"We're separated,\" Zhou Ze said with a pout.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThen, silence again.\n\nNext, a third cigarette.\n\n\"I have to go back to my hometown for a bit. I'll make a new batch of plum juice tomorrow and leave some for you.\"\n\n\"Thanks. You're not from around here?\"\n\n\"I'm from Menhai.\"\n\nMenhai was a county-level district under the administration of Tongcheng.\n\n\"A relative of mine is getting married. To be honest, I don't want to go, but I have to. After all, we're friends who made mud pies together as kids and shamelessly followed wedding processions to ask for red envelopes and lucky money.\"\n\n\"Is he asking you to be a bridesmaid?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, a bridesmaid...\" Xu Qinglang caught on and immediately shot Zhou Ze a glare. \"A groomsman.\"\n\n\"Were you married in your past life?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"Nope,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Well, that's great. It's like you got a free wife in this life.\"\n\n\"She's not with...\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, not continuing.\n\nThe lingering attachment,\n\nXu Le's lingering attachment,\n\nIt's still there!\n\nYes, that must be it.\n\n\"Since you're alive, just live well. My parents are gone, completely gone. I've come to terms with it. I have to grow up, have to find my own life.\n\nMaybe I'll even find a girlfriend after a while.\"\n\n\"A boyfriend is more likely,\" Zhou Ze said, blowing a smoke ring, adding a final jab.\n\n\"Heh heh, since I was little, I've been designing my future wedding in my head. What style, what look, what kind of spectacle...\"\n\n\"Isn't that something girls think about?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Can't a man have dreams? You, shut up, or there'll be no juice for you tomorrow!\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. *Fine, I'll shut up.*\n\n\"I plan to have a traditional-style wedding, a very retro one.\n\nI don't want any luxury cars; I want an eight-man sedan chair, just like in the movies.\n\nThen I'll rent a horse, wear a magua or a Hanfu.\n\nThat atmosphere,\n\nYou get it?\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched out a hand and pointed forward.\n\n\"Is it like that?\"\n\nXu Qinglang paused, squinting into the distance. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"You can't see it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression hardened. He hurried back into his shop and quickly returned, wiping something shiny on his eyes. Then, he let out a gasp.\n\nIndeed, on the empty street ahead, a red, eight-man sedan chair was advancing toward them.\n\nThe chair bearers had red sashes tied around their waists and red ceremonial caps on their heads. All eight bearers moved in perfect unison.\n\nAs they advanced, their steps were nine shallow and one deep.\n\nBecause of this, the sedan chair would jolt every so often, and the bearers, along with the two suona players in front, would hop in unison.\n\nIt looked very festive.\n\nBut for such a scene to suddenly appear in this deserted area was enough to scare the living daylights out of any passerby.\n\nEven Xu Qinglang stood with his mouth agape, momentarily at a loss.\n\n\"Your bride?\" Zhou Ze asked, pointing at the approaching wedding procession.\n\n\"Bullshit.\" Xu Qinglang took a few steps back, almost retreating into his shop. Seeing Zhou Ze still squatting there, he yelled, \"Aren't you going back inside? This is a ghostly wedding procession!\"\n\n\"Will they throw an embroidered ball?\" Zhou Ze patted his pant legs and slowly stood up.\n\n\"If they catch you, you'll be their captured consort,\" Xu Qinglang snorted. \"Do you want to be a bookstore owner or be snatched away to be some ghost-woman's husband?\"\n\n\"Is it that serious?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. The ghosts he had met before didn't have this much power—or to be more precise, this much influence.\n\nIf the master in the sedan chair could really snatch a person's soul to go back with her for a \"wedding,\" should he intervene or not?\n\nHe could turn a blind eye to that woman; she'd probably lose her lingering attachment and dissipate to report to Hell after her son's exam. But this one...\n\nWith such a grand procession, she was definitely not a simple character.\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Xu Qinglang stood inside his shop, looked up at the talisman paper stuck above his door, and still felt uneasy. Seeing Zhou Ze remain unmoved, he grew even more frustrated and cursed:\n\n\"You're just a rookie ghost! They're seasoned spirits. If you back off, she might not bother you.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Vaguely, he felt the mark on his palm growing a little hot, as if reminding him that the entity before him needed to be sent down, otherwise it would affect the mortal world.\n\nPreviously, when he had let the woman go, the mark had not reacted, which was a tacit approval. But this time, the mark was warning him.\n\nBeing a temp...\n\n...is not easy.\n\nUsually, when something goes wrong, or there's a work-related oversight, it's the temp who takes the fall.\n\nZhou Ze was now in that very awkward position.\n\nThe wedding procession stopped about ten meters away from Zhou Ze.\n\nTwo bearers reached out and lifted the sedan curtain.\n\nIt was empty inside.\n\nThe suona player walked toward Zhou Ze, stopping a meter away and bowing deeply.\n\n\"Our mistress has heard of Sir's recent appointment and has ordered us to invite Sir to her estate for congratulations.\"\n\nThis suona player was handsome and elegant, but his skin was very pale, and his blush and lipstick were a bit excessive, just like the paper effigies sold in joss paper shops.\n\n\"You became a Ghost Emissary?\" Xu Qinglang walked out of his shop, looking as if his dirt-poor next-door neighbor, Wang Xiaodan, had suddenly become the town mayor.\n\n\"If you get rich, don't forget me! You actually kept this from me!\" Xu Qinglang walked over and complained to Zhou Ze. The flair in his manner was so crisp and captivating it was bone-deep, enough to make a poplar bow.\n\n\"This lowly one has a matter to inquire of Sir,\" the suona player asked, still bowing respectfully.\n\n\"Speak! What is it? No problem, leave it to him! From now on, this whole area is under his jurisdiction!\" Xu Qinglang said, putting on airs and taking over on Zhou Ze's behalf, flamboyant to a ridiculous degree.\n\n\"While ordering us to fetch Sir, our mistress also wanted us to capture a man to return with for marriage.\n\nIt is said that this man owns over twenty properties in the mortal world, a perfect match for our mistress.\n\nMay I ask Sir, do you know where this man is?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n---\n¹The *gaokao* (高考) is China's notoriously difficult national college entrance examination, a pivotal event in a young person's life.",

    "content": "The state of the world is degenerating, and people's hearts are not what they once were!\n\n***\n\nMany people lament this modern era, how the whole of society has been scoured raw by the tide of materialism, to the point that even marriage is placed on a scale to be traded for equal value.\n\nHowever, in this day and age, it turns out that even ghosts are starting to get particular about this when they get married!\n\nYou have over twenty houses for the living,\n\nWhat a coincidence,\n\nMy mistress has over twenty houses for the dead,\n\nA perfect match!\n\nJoy, oh joy,\n\nEveryone is happy!\n\nAfter the old man with the suona asked this question, the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched subconsciously.\n\nHe was holding back a laugh, and at the same time, deep down, he felt truly satisfied.\n\nZhou Ze had long wanted to smack this neighbor of his, who was always running his mouth about \"I have over twenty houses.\" This ghost mistress had truly come at the perfect time.\n\nWhat goes around, comes around!\n\nXu Qinglang was so frightened that sweat started pouring out. He was a mystic, but he was merely capable of opening his Yin-Yang Eyes, playing with some puppets, and incorporating a few tricks from \"Sichuan opera face-changing.\" He wasn't a Celestial Master Zhang-type existence in the true sense of the word; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so cowardly when facing the little loli.\n\nInstantly snapping back to his senses, Xu Qinglang began to raise his head,\n\nAnd gaze at the sky.\n\nWhat are you talking about,\n\nI don't understand.\n\nThat person,\n\nI don't know him.\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang's eyelid suddenly twitched, because he saw that Zhou Ze's right hand, which had been at his side, had raised a single index finger, pointing directly at him.\n\n\"@#￥%……*&*!!!!!\"\n\nA torrent of ten thousand bottles of sour plum juice surged through Xu Qinglang's heart!\n\nThe two suona players walked directly to Xu Qinglang's sides and said respectfully:\n\n\"Young Master, please enter the sedan chair.\"\n\nWell, would you look at that. Turns out this sedan chair wasn't here to pick up a Ghost Emissary; it was brought specially by that ghost mistress to welcome her new groom.\n\nZhou Ze once again redefined his status as a \"temporary worker\" in his mind.\n\n\"Don't pull me, don't drag me, don't force me!\n\nWatch out, or I'll turn nasty!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was pushed toward the sedan chair by the suona players, but he continued to struggle relentlessly.\n\nHe had just said he wanted to start a new life, find a partner and all that, but he had no intention of getting involved with a ghost!\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you set me up, you've doomed me!\" Xu Qinglang shouted, giving off the distinct impression of a virtuous woman being forced into prostitution.\n\nDeath before dishonor,\n\nChastity everlasting!\n\n\"Go check it out. What if the ghost mistress looks just like Joey Wong?¹ You wouldn't be losing out, would you?\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\nXu Qinglang was shoved into the sedan chair. One of the suona players said to Zhou Ze, \"Sir Emissary may follow us. We shall lead the way.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the suona player even pointed at the electric scooter parked at Xu Qinglang's door:\n\n\"Sir Emissary may ride this.\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that the last time he had ridden in that ghost driver's paper car, he had still been delivered safely to the bookstore's entrance. So, it was clear that some ghostly beings did possess abilities akin to Qimen Dunjia,² and that certain physical laws likely didn't apply to them.\n\nThe electric scooter belonged to Xu Qinglang, and Zhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony. After locking the shop door, he got on the scooter and followed the sedan chair.\n\nThe sedan bearers walked at a brisk pace,\n\nTheir steps still following a pattern of nine shallow, one deep.\n\nEvery time they reached the \"one deep\" step, all eight bearers and the two suona players would hop in unison, causing the bridal sedan to sway along with them.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA cry of \"Ah!\" would come from Xu Qinglang, who was seated inside the bridal sedan;\n\nLike the gentle cry of an oriole, it was melodious and alluring, sparking the imagination.\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze had ridden his scooter alongside the bridal sedan, Xu Qinglang lifted the window curtain. Seen from the outside, Xu Qinglang's face was flushed, and his eyes seemed to broadcast alluring glances, as if they had been... moistened.\n\nHis pearly teeth bit his red lip, creating the very picture of a shy, handsome, and lovable figure.\n\nJust then, it was time for the bearers' \"one deep\" step. The sedan suddenly lifted.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nXu Qinglang cried out subconsciously again, a look of vexation on his face. He stared daggers at Zhou Ze, truly overcome with shame!\n\nZhou Ze gripped the scooter's handlebars with one hand and waved dismissively with the other, saying with disgust:\n\n\"Shameless.\"\n\n\"This sedan affects the soul! It stimulates the soul!\" Xu Qinglang felt compelled to explain. He was genuinely worried Zhou Ze would think he was lost in enjoyment and unable to pull himself away.\n\n\"Explaining is just making excuses,\" said Zhou Ze. \"The mouth says no, but the body is honest.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nShooting one last hateful glance at Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang lowered the curtain.\n\nThat glance was like one you'd give to a heartless lover who would sacrifice you for fame and fortune!\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze could see that the sedan bearers and suona players were moving according to a specific rhythm. They were mere puppets, likely paper effigies from a joss paper shop, somewhat similar to the wooden oxen and gliding horses designed by Zhuge Liang during the Three Kingdoms era.³\n\nThe bearers continued their \"nine shallow, one deep\" steps,\n\nXu Qinglang would let out an \"Ah!\" every so often,\n\nAnd Zhou Ze followed along on his little scooter.\n\nBefore he knew it, the procession had already passed through the city center and entered the Tongzhou District.\n\nA few years ago, Tongzhou District was still a county under Tongcheng's jurisdiction and had only recently been redesignated from a county to a district. Zhou Ze had been here once before when he was helping the old woman from the morgue look for her money.\n\nFinally, the procession of bearers entered a patch of wasteland just off Jianghai Avenue. The area was surrounded by tall buildings, and this spot had likely been left untouched due to some special reason that had halted construction.\n\nThe road inside was no longer easy to drive on, so Zhou Ze had to get off and push the scooter forward.\n\nAfter another few dozen meters,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nThe view opened up!\n\nThe originally dark and desolate wasteland was now hung with lanterns and colored streamers. Ahead, more than twenty tables were set for an open-air banquet, and on each table, ten cold dishes were arranged neatly.\n\nA crowd of heads bobbed about amidst piles of rouge and powder, filled with soft laughter and chatter.\n\nA busybody yelled out at the top of their lungs: \"The groom has arrived!\"\n\nIn an instant, a swarm of powdered and perfumed women in skirts and hairpins descended upon them. Zhou Ze felt himself surrounded by a lively flock of chattering women. Some of them passed directly through his body and the scooter, coming and going tirelessly.\n\nAll the while, Zhou Ze's right hand was clenched tightly, the mark on it still burning.\n\nActually, even without the mark's reminder, Zhou Ze knew clearly that this place was likely something a Ghost Emissary needed to resolve.\n\nBecause the ghosts here, under the call of that ghost mistress, had already become an organized and established group. This, of course, could not be tolerated!\n\nBut Zhou Ze kept holding back. For one, he had just started as a temporary worker and was in no rush to make a big show of it right after taking office. Otherwise, he might just get himself burned. After all, whenever something went wrong in any department in the mortal world, it was always the temporary workers who took the fall. Zhou Ze figured the Underworld was probably much the same; after all, people from the mortal world only went to the Underworld after they died.\n\nFurthermore, Zhou Ze was also aware that if it were really so easy to handle, why didn't that little loli take care of it herself?\n\nThe other party had even dared to come to his door and invite him, a Ghost Emissary, to offer congratulations, which was enough to show their brazen confidence.\n\n\"Lower the sedan!\"\n\nThe bearers lowered the chair in unison. Xu Qinglang was pushed out, looking demure and timid, while also being consumed by shame and indignation.\n\n\"The mistress awaits.\"\n\nA woman dressed in a black, ancient-style dress walked up to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang and curtsied.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nZhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\nXu Qinglang brushed Zhou Ze's hand away with disgust but still followed him forward.\n\nAs they walked through the banquet tables, listening to the various ghosts pointing and gossiping about them, Zhou Ze felt genuinely ill at ease. Fortunately, by the time they reached a small, two-story red house, the cacophony of surrounding voices finally faded away.\n\nThe building was decorated with lanterns and streamers, hung with large lanterns, and adorned with new spring couplets, presenting a scene of lively celebration.\n\nThe layout was similar to a modern house, with the living room in the center where the main door opened. The maid in the black dress gestured for Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang to enter.\n\n\"Excited?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked. \"If she really has the same air as Joey Wong, don't you dare get so happy you forget to come back.\"\n\n\"I'm hoping she's into 'one dragon playing with two phoenixes.'\"\n\nXu Qinglang said viciously, making it clear that if he was going down, he was dragging Zhou Ze down with him.\n\nIt was just that Zhou Ze had been so relentless in kicking him while he was down along the way, as if he was hell-bent on seeing him make a fool of himself!\n\nSo what if he liked to run his mouth about \"I have over twenty houses\"?\n\nWasn't it a fact!\n\nHad he intentionally been flaunting it?\n\nThey stepped into the main hall, their feet treading on a bright red carpet. The four walls were hung with exquisite cross-stitch art.\n\nA woman in a red wedding dress sat gracefully at a small table.\n\nOn the table were exquisite dishes and wine.\n\n\"Sir Emissary, my lord, please be seated.\"\n\nThe woman stood up and gestured for the two to take their seats.\n\nBecause the woman's face was hidden by a wedding veil, it couldn't be seen clearly.\n\nBut her voice was truly beautiful.\n\nZhou Ze sat down and pulled on Xu Qinglang, who then reluctantly took a seat.\n\nMight as well play it by ear since they were already here. Let's see what tricks she has up her sleeve.\n\nThe dishes on the small table were exquisite and fragrant, and the wine was mellow, its aroma intoxicating.\n\n\"Sir Emissary, my husband, please eat,\" the ghost mistress said, gesturing for the two of them to dine.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move, maintaining his composure.\n\nXu Qinglang, his face a mask of grief and indignation, downed three cups of wine in one go, then exclaimed: \"Good wine!\"\n\nFollowing that, he began to eat nonstop, completely channeling his grief and indignation into his appetite.\n\nWatching from the side, Zhou Ze's chest heaved, and he covered his mouth with his hand.\n\n\"What's wrong with you? Eat! It's delicious, even better than my own cooking.\" Xu Qinglang was a chef himself, so he could naturally tell the quality of the dishes.\n\n*Have you never seen a ghost movie?*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nBut he still said nothing. Instead, he picked up his chopsticks, placed some food into Xu Qinglang's bowl, and instructed:\n\n\"Be good, eat up. There's no sour plum juice here, so I don't have an appetite. You know how it is.\"\n\nXu Qinglang grunted twice, harboring no suspicion, and continued to eat. If he was going to die, he would die on a full stomach!\n\nBesides, it was truly delicious!\n\nXu Qinglang was even thinking about whether he should find a chance later to ask the ghost mistress for her recipes. If these dishes were sold on the market, even the top chefs at five-star hotels couldn't produce such flavor.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang had eaten his fill,\n\nZhou Ze nodded with satisfaction,\n\nAnd asked the ghost mistress, \"Mistress, may I ask how these dishes were made?\"\n\n\"Sir Emissary is too kind. This wine was brewed by yours truly from the urine of passersby;\n\nAnd these dishes were meticulously prepared by yours truly using the freshest snakes, insects, rats, and ants...\"\n\nXu Qinglang's face changed drastically.\n\nHe pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, but before he could say anything,\n\nHe immediately went:\n\n\"Bleeeaaargh...\"\n\n***\n\n¹ **Joey Wong (王祖賢):** A famous Hong Kong actress, best known for her iconic role as a beautiful ghost in the 1987 film *A Chinese Ghost Story*.\n\n² **Qimen Dunjia (奇門遁甲):** An ancient form of Chinese metaphysics and divination.

    "content": "Xu Qinglang vomited until the world turned dark, nearly throwing up his own bile.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head slightly. This kid… he was still too young. He must not have watched enough ghost movies as a kid. This whole \"meeting a ghost in the wild and sharing a meal\" thing was a classic trope.\n\nThe delicacies on the plates were actually just maggots, earthworms, cockroaches, ants, and so on.\n\nThis trope had been done to death.\n\nEven if he didn't have his eating disorder, Zhou Ze wouldn't have touched a single bite.\n\nDid you really expect the ghosts here to go out grocery shopping every day? To set up a stove and cook for you?\n\nZhou Ze remembered a case from the past. A man went to visit a friend. The friend said his wife was away on a trip, so he would have to entertain him alone. He stayed at his friend's house for a week. The only drawback was that his friend's house had too few vegetable dishes; it was all meat, but the meat soup was delicious.\n\nWhen he was leaving, he ran into a neighbor who said the friend hadn't left his house in almost a month, just locking himself inside all day.\n\nAfter hearing this, the man immediately threw up.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up the wine in front of him, then put it down.\n\nHe’d almost forgotten.\n\nIt was passerby pee.\n\n\"Husband, you seem unwell. Why don't you go down and rest first,\" the Ghostly Madam said, looking at the black-gowned maid beside her.\n\nThe maid nodded and walked over to help Xu Qinglang up.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed her hand away, sat up straight, and said:\n\n\"Just say what you want to do, and be quick about it. I don't want to play these roundabout games anymore.\"\n\nMm, Xu Qinglang was angry.\n\nUtterly furious.\n\nThe Ghostly Madam stood up and walked before Zhou Ze. He could clearly smell the delicate fragrance emanating from her. Her graceful figure, her voluptuous curves, couldn't help but make one's imagination run wild.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief inwardly.\n\nHe'd been spending a lot of time with Xu Qinglang, but he was still normal.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't have the courage to lift the Ghostly Madam's red veil.\n\nA beautiful face, a pile of dry bones. It was to be expected.\n\nJudging by the decor and layout here, it was clear this Ghostly Madam had been dead for a very long time. If you lifted her veil and she was in a good mood, perhaps she'd show you the face she had in life.\n\nIf your luck was bad, she'd just blind your damn eyes with a skull riddled with crawling maggots.\n\nZhou Ze remembered a report he'd read in his past life. Back then, it was very trendy for husbands to accompany their wives into the delivery room.\n\nMany sentimental people thought this would help husbands understand their wives' sacrifice and greatness. Later, a Japanese husband who did this fell into a depression, developing a psychological trauma that made it impossible for him to live a normal married life. In the end, they had no choice but to divorce.\n\nAnd right now, Zhou Ze was well aware that he had a neighbor more beautiful than any woman constantly by his side. If he got spooked by this Ghostly Madam's face, his own orientation might truly plunge into an unfathomable abyss.\n\nIn both his past and present lives, he had never really found fulfillment with women. Zhou Ze had no desire to skip steps and start playing some advanced-level game¹ this lifetime.\n\n\"Sir Envoy, this humble one asked you to come here rather than visiting you myself not out of disrespect or intentional neglect, but because I truly have no other way to leave this place,\" the Ghostly Madam pleaded tearfully to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for this gentleman, the reason he was invited was simply because, over a decade ago when he was just a child, he passed by here and made a joking remark. He told his companion at the time that if a female ghost were truly as beautiful as Joey Wang² in the movies, he would be willing to marry her.\"\n\nHearing this, Xu Qinglang's jaw dropped.\n\nHe'd completely forgotten. That actually happened?\n\nZhou Ze, however, glanced at Xu Qinglang with a look that said: *I didn't realize. For someone who looks so effeminate, you sure matured early.*\n\n\"Specifically, what is the matter?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't immediately say, *You've been a very naughty ghost, and I'm taking you back to Hell.*\n\nThe little loli had once said he was the most self-aware person she'd ever met.\n\nIndeed.\n\nZhou Ze was very aware right now. With no benefit, no performance bonus, and no mission, there was really no need for him to sacrifice himself for the prosperity of Hell.\n\n\"Fret not, Sir Envoy. This humble one will be departing today, my soul returning to the Netherworld.\" The Ghostly Madam smiled and continued, \"My surname is Bai. I was the daughter of a scholarly family during the Daoguang era.³ Alas, my fate was cruel. I died suddenly on the eve of my wedding and was buried here. It has been nearly two hundred years since.\n\n\"Though I am a ghost, I have never committed any malicious deeds. I once protected the peace and prosperity of the local villagers. Mr. Se'an⁴ even wrote a plaque for my shrine, and from that time, I had a temple body and could receive incense offerings.\n\n\"However, in the last sixty years, the shrine fell into disrepair and can no longer be found. Nowadays, no one even knows that an unauthorized shrine⁵ once stood here.\"\n\n\"Who is Mr. Se'an?\" Xu Qinglang asked, blinking.\n\n\"Zhang Jian,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Oh, him,\" Xu Qinglang now understood.\n\nZhang Jian was a famous figure from Tongcheng in the late Qing dynasty. He was the one who drafted the abdication edict for the Qing Emperor, a top scholar of the late Qing, and also a nationalist entrepreneur.\n\nThe \"unauthorized shrine\" the Ghostly Madam mentioned didn't refer to a sordid place, but rather to a temple not recognized by the imperial court's rites, housing a deity of illicit worship.\n\n\"Then you're quite formidable,\" Xu Qinglang said, having recovered from his earlier vomiting. After the Ghostly Madam explained that he was only invited because of a childhood joke, he relaxed. As long as he wasn't being forced to be her husband, it was fine.\n\nCultivating for two hundred years and even having a shrine built to receive incense offerings—she should have transcended the level of a mere ghost by now, right?\n\n\"Now, my cultivation is complete, and I am about to descend into the Netherworld. However, there is one matter I cannot ignore.\"\n\nThe Ghostly Madam gave Zhou Ze a slight bow and pleaded:\n\n\"My former physical body, due to the circumstances of my burial, has remained uncorrupted for two hundred years, as if alive. My soul is now about to enter the Netherworld, but I cannot take my body with me.\n\n\"Furthermore, over these two hundred years, my body, influenced by my soul, has begun to show signs of becoming malevolent. I do not wish that after my soul departs, I leave behind a body that, should some accident occur, reawakens and commits deeds that offend Heaven and reason. Therefore, I implore Sir Envoy for your help.\"\n\n\"How... do you want me to help you?\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his hands together. Since this Ghostly Madam planned to go to Hell on her own, that was for the best. This was practically turning herself in.\n\nNo, it wasn't quite like turning herself in. It was more like an ancient rebel army growing strong enough to accept an amnesty from the imperial court, washing their slate clean and receiving an official post.\n\nBut regardless, as long as it wasn't a head-on confrontation with him, it was fine.\n\n\"This humble one asks Sir Envoy to help watch over my physical body, and on the night of the next Cold Clothing Festival, cremate it with bamboo and wood,\" the Ghostly Madam said.\n\n\"Help watch over it?\" Zhou Ze thought for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"Does this mean Sir Envoy agrees?\" the Ghostly Madam confirmed. \"This humble one thanks you, Sir Envoy.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up his wine cup again.\n\nAnd...\n\nPut it back down.\n\n\"Then, this humble one will take my leave.\" The Ghostly Madam's figure began to slowly fade, her departure swift and clean.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. The next moment, he found that the entire scene around them had vanished. He and Xu Qinglang were sitting on two stone stumps.\n\nThe banquet had disappeared without a trace. All they could see were jagged rocks and dense, wild grass.\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette, looking somewhat wistful.\n\n\"Disappointed you didn't get to see what your wife looks like?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Why didn't you lift the veil and see for yourself?\" Xu Qinglang snorted.\n\nDistance tests a horse's strength; time reveals a person's heart. Tonight, Zhou Ze had kicked him when he was down countless times, and Xu Qinglang was keeping a tally in his little mental notebook.\n\n\"She's your wife. How could I presume to overstep?\" Zhou Ze scanned the surroundings, then stomped his shoe on the ground. \"So, Madam Bai's body is buried right under this spot?\"\n\n\"Should be.\" Xu Qinglang was also a bit unsure, but soon his eyes spotted two rusty iron shovels lying in the grass ahead. \"I guess so. She even prepared the shovels for us.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over, and he and Xu Qinglang each grabbed a shovel. There was nothing else to say. Time to dig!\n\nThe two of them dug until dawn, drenched in sweat. Finally, they hit something hard below. Brushing away the dirt, they could see a red wooden coffin.\n\nIt took them another half an hour to completely unearth it.\n\n\"Let's open it,\" Zhou Ze said. \"It's almost morning. Let's finish up, or if someone sees us, they'll call the police thinking we're grave robbers.\"\n\n\"You do it.\" Xu Qinglang wiped away his sweat. \"I find it disgusting.\"\n\n\"Didn't she say her body hadn't decomposed?\"\n\n\"Who knows if that's true?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. No choice. This was something he had promised to do. Xu Qinglang was just helping out as a friend. If he wasn't willing to do it, Zhou Ze had to do it himself.\n\nPrying open the coffin nails, Zhou Ze stood at the edge and gave a hard pull. The coffin lid was lifted off. Then, Zhou Ze took out his phone, turned on the flashlight, and shone it down.\n\n\"Heh... She's actually quite beautiful.\"\n\nXu Qinglang also leaned over for a look. Indeed, the woman lying in the coffin wore a white dress, her long hair draped over her shoulders. Her face was dignified and beautiful, her body showing no signs of decay. She looked as if she were merely asleep.\n\n\"She's your wife. You wanna, you know, while she's still warm...\"\n\nXu Qinglang shoved Zhou Ze hard. \"What nonsense are you talking about? Hurry up and carry her out so we can take her back.\"\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang was very proactive. He jumped down and lifted the female corpse.\n\nBut the moment he lifted her from the coffin floor, his expression changed. He immediately put the body down and began rubbing his hands vigorously at his side.\n\n\"Hiss... So cold. A bone-chilling cold. The malevolent energy on this corpse is so strong, it's on the verge of becoming a *jiangshi*!⁶ That Madam Bai definitely wasn't telling the whole truth.\n\n\"Out of a woman's vanity, she must have spent the last two hundred years intentionally nourishing her own body.\n\n\"Now that her cultivation is complete and she's ready to leave, she's left behind this huge problem.\"\n\nZhou Ze went down himself. As he lifted the female corpse, he too instantly felt that iciness that seemed to penetrate his very soul.\n\nBut in the next moment, Zhou Ze found his fingernails beginning to grow longer. That iciness—the malevolent energy Xu Qinglang had mentioned—began to actively pour into Zhou Ze's nails.\n\nIn an instant,\n\na tingling, heavenly sensation made Zhou Ze's very soul tremble. It seemed to be a form of nourishment.\n\n\"Hah... ooh... hsss... mmm...\"\n\nXu Qinglang, who was still off to the side checking his hands for frostbite, heard Zhou Ze's noises. He turned, his face filled with shock, and pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You beast!\n\n\"You're actually doing it while she's still warm!\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Advanced-level game:** A euphemism Zhou Ze uses for homosexuality, implying it's a step beyond his current \"level\" of experience with relationships.\n2.  **Joey Wang:** A Taiwanese actress famous for her role as a beautiful ghost in the 1987 Hong Kong film *A Chinese Ghost Story*.\n3.  **Daoguang era:** An era of the Qing Dynasty, lasting from 1820 to 1850.\n4.  **Mr. Se'an (嗇庵先生):** Se'an was the style name of Zhang Jian (張謇), a real historical figure.\n5.  **Unauthorized shrine (yin祠):** A shrine dedicated to a deity not officially recognized or sanctioned by the state religion or rites.\n6.  ***Jiangshi* (殭屍):** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes compared to a hopping vampire or zombie.",

    "content": "Before the sky had a chance to brighten, Zhou Ze used his electric scooter to transport the female corpse back to the bookstore. As for Xu Qinglang, he was left behind, waiting to hail a cab.\n\nAfter all, he had arrived in a sedan chair; there wouldn't be one for the ride back.\n\nUpon returning to the bookstore, Zhou Ze placed the female corpse in the freezer on the shop's second floor. He then went downstairs, took a shower, and had just changed into a fresh set of clothes when Xu Qinglang, who had finally managed to get a cab, arrived. He walked straight into the bookstore and, seeing Zhou Ze's wet hair, teased him:\n\n\"You need to control yourself.\"\n\n\"Heh heh,\" was Zhou Ze's only reply.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head and left the bookstore without another word. Tonight's events had tired him out as well.\n\nZhou Ze locked the shop door and went up to the second floor. He stood by the freezer, looking at the female corpse inside.\n\nThe corpse's features were exquisite, and she had a remarkable air about her. People in ancient times married quite young; mothers at fifteen or sixteen were common. Consequently, having died before her wedding, Lady Bai's corpse looked about the age of an ordinary high school student, yet she possessed a natural, bewitching allure.\n\nXu Qinglang's beauty was that of a peony in full, seductive bloom, while this Lady Bai before him was an understated daisy.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wasn't about to have any wild fantasies about a corpse. What he was contemplating was on another level entirely.\n\nOn the ride back, his ten fingernails had been in constant contact with the female corpse as he held her on the scooter. It was as if currents of electricity were surging into his body, continuously stimulating his soul and his nails.\n\nThankfully, Xu Qinglang wasn't with him on the way back, or Zhou Ze probably would have ended up crying out just as Xu Qinglang had in the sedan chair. This sort of thing was not something to be shared with outsiders.\n\nBy the time he carried her back into the bookstore, Zhou Ze noticed that the chilling aura from her body seemed to have dissipated by more than half.\n\nShe was like a rechargeable battery that he had just drained. But it shouldn't be a big problem; lying there, she should be able to recharge herself naturally.\n\nHolding his palms up before him, his fingernails slowly extended. A blood-red streak had actually appeared on his originally black, translucent nails—a change that must have come from absorbing the corpse's baleful energy.\n\nIt actually looked pretty good.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and reached for the cup of warm water he had just brought upstairs, only to find it had gone cold.\n\nBecause of the female corpse, the temperature on this small second floor was even lower than outside, and Zhou Ze's own perception of \"cold\" was already somewhat weak.\n\nToo bad it wasn't summer. If it were, with the female corpse here, his shop could even save on air conditioning bills, and it would probably work as an insect repellent too.\n\nThat night, Zhou Ze made a pallet on the floor next to the freezer and slept soundly.\n\nThe little loli had once said that if he held her, Zhou Ze could fall asleep without needing the freezer. It seemed the female corpse had a similar effect.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze stretched and placed his fingernails on her lower abdomen. Instantly, the icy sensation washed over him again.\n\nIt felt so good.\n\nSo enjoyable.\n\nBut the sensation only lasted for about half a minute before dissipating, which meant that was all the energy the female corpse had managed to recharge overnight.\n\nLady Bai had said she was worried her body might reanimate, and Xu Qinglang had also mentioned that the dense baleful energy around the corpse could easily turn it into a zombie if stimulated. But now, it seemed the probability of that was low. However much baleful energy she gathered, he would just absorb it all each day.\n\nAlthough he had no idea what use this stuff was to him, the sheer pleasure of it was enough to keep Zhou Ze happily engrossed.\n\nAfter eating at Xu Qinglang's shop next door, Zhou Ze sat leisurely in his own store. Before he could even decide which book to read, his phone rang.\n\nIt was his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back for a minute.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze didn't believe his sister-in-law would suddenly call him out of concern. The girl was still in her rebellious teenage phase, a bit self-centered—or rather, quite selfish and unreasonable.\n\n\"Your paternal uncle is at my house. Come and get him,\" his sister-in-law said impatiently.\n\n\"Paternal uncle?\" Zhou Ze frowned slightly. He remembered that Xu Le, like himself, was an orphan. Of course, Xu Le hadn't grown up in an orphanage; his parents had passed away one after another shortly after he was born.\n\n\"Okay, I'm on my way.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Zhou Ze told Xu Qinglang next door to keep an eye on his shop for him, then hailed a cab to head back to the Lin family's home.\n\nWang Ke's therapeutic advice had been to temporarily cut off ties with his original social network, but times had changed. Before, Zhou Ze was undocumented, something of a rat scurrying in the streets. Now he was a temporary civil serv-ape,¹ with far fewer things and dangers to worry about.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze had previously read through the private journal Xu Le kept in his social media space. It mentioned his paternal uncle, who had supported him through his schooling all these years.\n\nHaving taken over the man's body, there were some matters he ought to handle. What's more, Xu Le had long since gone to hell to be reincarnated; his own previous mental instability had nothing to do with Xu Le, but was rather a side effect of soul transmigration.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived at the Lin family's building, before he even entered, he saw an old man in a cotton-padded jacket with a wrinkled face sitting on the steps in the stairwell, smoking a long-stemmed pipe.\n\nBeside the old man were several woven plastic sacks. One seemed to contain chickens and ducks, another probably held things like sausages.\n\n\"Ah Le!\" The old man saw Xu Le walking up, immediately stood, and came over to him, clapping him firmly on the shoulder. \"The boy's grown taller again.\"\n\nZhou Ze managed a smile. He didn't ask why his uncle was sitting in the stairwell smoking. In truth, there was no need to ask.\n\nEven if his uncle had stepped out to smoke his pipe so as not to pollute their home, he wouldn't have left the local goods he'd brought with him outside. This could only mean the Lin family didn't welcome him, and hadn't even let him in the door.\n\nRecalling the tone and attitude of his sister-in-law on the phone earlier, it was easy enough to infer the Lin family's feelings toward this uncle of his.\n\nOf course, there was nothing to resent or hate. His relationship with the Lin family was already on the verge of shattering; it wasn't a matter of who was right or wrong.\n\n\"Have you eaten?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" the old man answered honestly.\n\n\"I'll take you to eat.\"\n\n\"Alright then.\"\n\nZhou Ze chose a restaurant, ordered a few dishes, and got a bottle of *baijiu*.\n\nThe old man poured for himself and drank alone. After a few sips, it was clear his mood was heavy. He had obviously felt the Lin family's coldness; they were in-laws, after all, and now they weren't even pretending to be civil.\n\n\"Le, my boy, if you're not happy here, why don't you just come on home,\" the uncle said, patting his own chest. \"The government's Targeted Poverty Alleviation policy is real good now. We don't have to worry about gettin' by anymore. You've been to college. You come back, we can start up some kind of specialty farming or somethin'. We won't live any worse than others.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's talk about it in a while,\" Zhou Ze said noncommittally.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The uncle knew Xu Le didn't drink, so he didn't ask Zhou Ze to join him. He slowly finished the bottle by himself, then ate two bowls of rice. After Zhou Ze paid the bill, he picked up his things and walked out of the restaurant with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Take these things with you. They don't want them, so you eat them.\" The uncle handed the woven plastic sacks to Zhou Ze. \"I've got to catch the afternoon bus back.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Zhou Ze didn't try to make him stay.\n\nThe uncle's tolerance for alcohol must have been high. Zhou Ze called a taxi for him, paid the driver in advance to take him to the bus station, and then carried the items back to the bookstore.\n\nXu Qinglang was sitting at the entrance, basking in the sun. Zhou Ze placed the pile of local specialties in front of him.\n\n\"Yo, what's all this?\"\n\n\"Ingredients for you.\" Zhou Ze found a chair nearby and sat down.\n\n\"Sure.\" Xu Qinglang didn't stand on ceremony; he hadn't been charging Zhou Ze for meals anyway. \"By the way, you told me your real name is Zhou Ze, but you never got specific about your past. What did you used to do?\"\n\n\"A doctor,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\nThere was no need to hide these things from Xu Qinglang.\n\nBesides, his identity had been cleaned up now, so he wasn't afraid of any official trouble.\n\n\"A doctor? Then you and your wife really are a pair.\" Xu Qinglang leisurely blew out a smoke ring. \"Haven't seen her around for a few days.\"\n\n\"It's a lost cause,\" Zhou Ze said with a carefree air.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe two shared another cigarette, then Zhou Ze got up, pushed open the bookstore door, and went inside.\n\nHe hadn't locked the door when he left that morning, having asked Xu Qinglang to keep an eye on things.\n\nSitting down behind the counter, Zhou Ze turned on the computer and clicked an icon. A video feed appeared on the desktop.\n\nA little while back, Zhou Ze had bought two pinhole cameras and placed them in the shop. One was positioned at the landing of the stairs, the other in the upper-left corner of the bookstore. They weren't expensive—the kind peeping Toms usually buy.\n\nHe casually picked up the cup on the counter, took a few sips of water, and started adjusting the playback time on the video.\n\nThere was a reason he had deliberately left the door unlocked and asked Xu Qinglang to watch the shop when he went out that morning.\n\nYesterday, Lady Bai had invited him over, and she had also sent a sedan chair for Xu Qinglang. Although she had explained it was because of a playful remark Xu Qinglang had made as a child, Zhou Ze didn't completely believe her.\n\nHe had brought the corpse back and placed it here. If Lady Bai and Xu Qinglang had some other connection, Xu Qinglang would likely have made a move this morning.\n\nOne can't be too careful. He wasn't even human anymore; it was only natural to be more cautious.\n\nAt 11:30 AM, the footage showed Xu Qinglang entering his shop.\n\nZhou Ze took another sip of water, feeling that the water in the cup tasted a little sweet, exceptionally so.\n\n*Must be psychological,* he thought. *Am I gloating because I think I've guessed right?*\n\nHowever, the footage only showed Xu Qinglang entering the shop, grabbing a few newspapers, sitting and reading for half an hour, then putting the papers back where he found them and leaving. He never went up to the second floor at all.\n\nWas I wrong?\n\nWas I measuring the heart of a gentleman with my own petty yardstick?\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips, smiled to himself, and drained the water in the cup.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to close the video and go wash his face, he suddenly remembered the camera positioned at the stairwell. That camera's angle could monitor the stairs and the area around the counter on the first floor.\n\nSince Xu Qinglang hadn't walked any further in, it probably didn't matter whether he watched it or not.\n\nBut because these cheap cameras had small storage, Zhou Ze still needed to delete the used memory to free up space.\n\nAt the same time, he casually clicked open the video from the second camera and dragged the progress bar from beginning to end, just going through the motions.\n\nHowever, in that instant, Zhou Ze thought he saw a white shadow flash past.\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\nZhou Ze instinctively pulled the mouse back. His other hand reached for the teacup again, only then realizing it was empty.\n\nForgetting all about getting more water,\n\nhe dragged the mouse again, this time inch by inch.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe screen captured the moment.\n\nA woman in a white dress was slowly walking down from the second floor!\n\nThat corpse...\n\nIt could move!\n\nZhou Ze felt a rush of blood to his head. A sense of crisis hit him directly, and his heart and breathing quickened.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was processing this,\n\nthe video continued to play.\n\nIn the footage,\n\nLady Bai's corpse walked to the edge of the counter and picked up the water cup that was sitting there.\n\nThen,\n\nlike a dog drinking water,\n\nshe stuck her tongue out and swirled it around in the cup a few times.\n\nAfterward, she put the cup down, turned around like a sleepwalker who had woken up thirsty for a drink,\n\nand slowly walked back upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, looking at the cup beside him, which he had just drunk dry.\n\nNo wonder, when I was drinking the water just now,\n\nI thought it tasted a little sweet...\n\n---\n¹A pun on \"公務員\" (gōngwùyuán, civil servant).

    "content": "Second floor,\n\nBy the freezer,\n\nZhou Ze stood for about half an hour.\n\nLady Bai was still lying inside, exactly the same as when Zhou Ze had gotten up and left this morning, without the slightest change. But the scene recorded by the camera couldn't be wrong.\n\nEspecially,\n\nthat glass of water,\n\nhe’d thought it was a bit sweet when he first started drinking it.\n\nThis wasn't a psychological effect, because he hadn't watched the video before drinking the water.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze wasn't too disgusted by the fact that he'd drunk her saliva. After all, just last night he had watched Xu Qinglang eat so many \"mountain delicacies and sea treasures.\"\n\nCompared to Xu Qinglang, what he'd gone through was just a drizzle.\n\nOf course, he didn't find it \"amorous\" either.\n\nThe woman before him, no matter how beautiful, was just a corpse. A corpse that had been lying underground for two hundred years.\n\nThe thought that she hadn't brushed her teeth in two hundred years was a bit hard for the mildly mysophobic Zhou Ze to accept.\n\nShe could move. She had gone downstairs, had a drink of water, and come back up.\n\nHad Lady Bai not told him the truth?\n\nOr perhaps there was another possibility: because of his fingernails last night, this corpse had also undergone some sort of change.\n\nRight now, Lady Bai's soul had already gone to Hell to report for duty; she was unlikely to deliberately leave a time bomb behind in the mortal world.\n\nThe little loli had once said that ghosts in the mortal world had to behave with their tails between their legs. Anyone who wanted to stir up trouble was tired of living, tired of their comfortable existence.\n\nHowever, the feeling of having a corpse on his second floor was completely different from the feeling of having a corpse that could move on his second floor. No one wanted a dangerous and unstable element right next to their bed.\n\n\"Hey, big sister, why don't you wake up so we can have a chat?\"\n\nZhou Ze said, leaning against the edge of the freezer.\n\nHe hoped the female corpse would open her eyes right then, either to fight him or to talk to him. They could find common ground while respecting their differences—at least tear through the paper window¹ and stop playing mysterious games.\n\nBut the female corpse remained motionless, still lying there.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then reached his hand inside and began to roam over the female corpse's body. He even desecrated some sensitive areas,\n\nhoping only that the female corpse would be unable to bear such \"indecency\" and open her eyes in anger.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nthe female corpse just lay there, cold as ice,\n\nunmoved.\n\nZhou Ze reckoned that even if he actually dropped his pants and got on top of her, the female corpse would maintain this state.\n\nHe pulled his hand back and pursed his lips, unsure of what to do.\n\nYou can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.\n\nThe next moment, the nails on Zhou Ze's fingertips began to lengthen. Then, Zhou Ze pierced his index fingernail into the female corpse's arm and began to apply pressure slowly.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThe nail, like a sharp blade, pierced the female corpse's arm. No blood flowed out; instead, a cloud of black qi began to seep out, and for a moment, the entire second-floor room was filled with a ghastly aura.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, what are you doing!\"\n\nXu Qinglang's shout came from downstairs.\n\nImmediately after, Xu Qinglang recklessly charged up to the second floor. Just then, Zhou Ze withdrew his hand. His fingernail seemed to be coated in a layer of frost; it felt a bit stiff and slightly painful.\n\n\"Are you crazy!\" Xu Qinglang looked at the narrow wound on the female corpse's arm and roared, \"When a Hanba appears, the land becomes barren for a thousand li, don't you know that!\n\n\"This female corpse is definitely not on the level of a Hanba, but if the aura stored inside her body leaks out, it's enough to start a plague in Tongcheng!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to deal with the fuming Xu Qinglang. Instead, he kept staring at the female corpse's arm. The wound he had just made was actually healing slowly.\n\nThis female corpse,\n\naside from her body being cold and breathless, was in all other aspects no different from a living person. In fact, her body was even more vigorous than a living person's!\n\n\"Hey, you and I dug this thing up together. If this thing causes any trouble, I'll have to face the music, lose years off my life, and maybe even bring disaster upon my descendants!\n\n\"Same goes for you. If you let this get out of hand, you won't be able to handle the consequences, even if you are an Emissary of Hell now.\"\n\nThe small amount of black qi that had just leaked from the female corpse slowly dissipated. Because the amount was small, and because only Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were present and had strong resistance, it wouldn't cause any harm.\n\nBut what had just leaked out was merely the tip of the iceberg of what was inside the corpse.\n\nZhou Ze sighed. \"Xu Qinglang.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why don't you take your wife over to your place? Didn't your parents just leave? Let her keep you company. After all, you were the one she properly married with an eight-man sedan chair.\"\n\n\"What? What do you mean by that?\" Xu Qinglang was completely bewildered.\n\n\"This thing... she can move on her own,\" Zhou Ze stated the reason. \"Today, she went downstairs by herself and had a drink of water.\"\n\nA look of horror appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. His mouth twitched, and he took two steps back.\n\nHe had said last night that if anything went wrong with this corpse, it would turn into a Jiangshi. And not the weak, brain-dead kind from Western movies that just moan \"arghhh arghhh\" and can be easily headshot, but a true Jiangshi that \"eats raw flesh and drinks blood\" and might even possess supernatural powers.\n\n\"Thanks, but I'm getting used to being alone.\"\n\nWhat a joke. There was no way Xu Qinglang would take this hot potato—no, this hot atomic bomb.\n\n\"Don't you have some kind of paper talismans? Stick some on her,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The talismans for my two blades would only have the opposite effect if I stuck them on her; they would just provoke her,\" Xu Qinglang said with a bitter smile.\n\n\"Then what do we do?\" Zhou Ze felt a headache coming on. \"Haul her out to sea and dump her? Even if she becomes a Jiangshi, at worst she can go bother the Dragon King of the Sea.\"\n\n\"She can't leave Tongcheng. She was a person of Tongcheng in life, so she is a ghost of Tongcheng in death. If her body leaves the Tongcheng area, she'll run into problems too. Otherwise, why didn't Lady Bai dispose of her before descending to the underworld with her merits fulfilled?\"\n\n*Clang!*\n\nZhou Ze slammed the lid of the freezer shut. Clearly, this problem was unsolvable.\n\nCouldn't burn it,\n\nCouldn't transport it,\n\nAnd was afraid of accidents if it was dumped elsewhere.\n\nSo he could only keep it in his own house and watch over it at his own risk?\n\nZhou Ze now sort of understood why the little loli had gone 'biu' and disappeared into Hell. Being a civil servant for the underworld wasn't so easy after all.\n\nEven after getting into the system, those working at the grassroots level always had it the hardest.\n\nJust like him right now.\n\n\"Look on the bright side. I'll make you extra sour plum juice tonight,\" Xu Qinglang comforted.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then I'm moving. Didn't I say I was planning to open a shop in a county town down below? I'm thinking of moving up the plan,\" Xu Qinglang said, adopting a 'let my Daoist friend die, but not this poor Daoist' stance.²\n\nAfter locking the freezer, Zhou Ze went downstairs with Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang gave Zhou Ze another earful about not messing around before heading back to his noodle shop. He had probably been busy with his own things, but the leak of baleful energy had scared him half to death and made him run over.\n\nZhou Ze sat down behind the counter,\n\nand picked up the water glass, swirling it in front of him.\n\nHis phone rang. He took it out and saw it was an unknown number.\n\n\"Hello, may I speak to Mr. Xu Le? We're from the Chongchuan Traffic Police Brigade.\"\n\n\"Yes, this is he. What is it?\"\n\n\"Is Xu Dachuan a relative of yours? He was just in a car accident and is now being sent to the People's Hospital.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll be right there.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes and let out a grunt of dissatisfaction. Things were annoying enough as it was, and now something else had come up. Xu Dachuan must be the uncle he had treated to lunch.\n\nBut he couldn't just not go. Although the man had made a special trip to the city to see Xu Le, not Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze had already given the local produce he brought to Xu Qinglang as ingredients.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his fingernails.\n\nIf Xu Dachuan was truly in mortal danger,\n\nshould he save him or not?\n\nThinking of the painful backlash he suffered after saving the little loli last time, a shiver ran down Zhou Ze's spine. Forget it, hopefully he's not seriously hurt.\n\nHe walked out of the shop, hailed a taxi, and on the way, sent Xu Qinglang a WeChat message saying he was heading out for a bit and for him to keep an eye on things.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the People's Hospital, it was already eight in the evening. Zhou Ze asked at the front desk and was relieved to learn that Xu Dachuan's life was not in danger and he had already been moved to a ward.\n\nPushing open the ward door, Zhou Ze paused as he walked in. He saw Dr. Lin standing by Xu Dachuan's bedside, chatting with him.\n\nOne of Xu Dachuan's legs was propped up, likely broken, and he had a few scrapes on his face, but he seemed to be in good spirits, looking quite energetic as he chatted with his nephew's wife.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked over, his eyes met Dr. Lin's.\n\n\"Thank you, sorry to trouble you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's what I should do,\" Dr. Lin stood up and explained, \"I wasn't home during the day, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nDr. Lin left the ward. Zhou Ze stayed and chatted with his uncle for a while. The long-distance bus had gotten into an accident before it even left the city limits. Xu Dachuan was a bit unlucky, having fallen and broken his left leg. The other passengers only had minor scrapes.\n\nXu Dachuan didn't seem to care much about his injury, instead repeating over and over, \"My nephew's wife is a good person.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, told Xu Dachuan to rest well, and then walked out of the ward.\n\nDr. Lin was standing by the nurses' station. A young female nurse was sitting there, looking a bit unwell.\n\nZhou Ze was about to leave, but he had to say goodbye to Dr. Lin. The two hadn't been in contact for a long time, but he still had to keep up appearances.\n\nHowever, as he got closer, Zhou Ze heard the sound of a baby crying, very faint, like a kitten.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't think much of it, but as he approached Dr. Lin, he found the baby's crying became clearer.\n\nCould it be that Dr. Lin was being haunted by a little ghost?\n\nZhou Ze was still observing, deliberately stepping to stand behind Dr. Lin to take a look.\n\n\"It's okay, Dr. Lin. I have a weak stomach, it's an old problem. I'll take some medicine later and I'll be fine,\" the young nurse said, thanking Dr. Lin for her concern.\n\n\"You should take better care of yourself,\" Dr. Lin consoled her.\n\nAt that moment, Dr. Lin noticed the somewhat... \"furtive\" Zhou Ze standing behind her.\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"Wait a second.\" Zhou Ze raised his hand, listened carefully again, and finally looked at the young nurse's stomach.\n\nThe sound wasn't coming from Dr. Lin, but from inside the young nurse.\n\nHaving been a doctor before, Zhou Ze immediately understood what was going on.\n\n\"You're pregnant,\" Zhou Ze said to the young nurse. At a time like this, Zhou Ze couldn't afford to be tactful and drop hints to save face.\n\n\"What?\" The young nurse looked dumbfounded.\n\n\"What nonsense are you spouting? Chen isn't even married and doesn't have a boyfriend,\" Dr. Lin glared at her \"husband.\"\n\n\"I don't know who you got pregnant with, but you'd better go get a check-up right now. Also, a word of warning, you're at risk of a miscarriage,\" Zhou Ze said with great certainty.\n\nThe fetus was very unstable. The faint crying represented the instinctive sorrow of an unborn child, which was why Zhou Ze hadn't worried about her saving face.\n\nA human life was at stake.\n\nHearing this, Nurse Chen shot up from her seat, a look of anxiety on her face. It was clear she hadn't known she was pregnant, but she knew she had engaged in \"high-risk\" behavior, so the possibility of conception was high.\n\nDr. Lin saw it too and immediately rushed off with Chen.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, thinking it was a shame that Xu Le had studied civil engineering. If Xu Le had studied medicine, he would probably soon become the most famous doctor not just in Tongcheng, but in the entire Su Province.\n\nHe went downstairs, bought a case of milk and some daily necessities for Xu Dachuan, delivered them to his ward, and then came out again, this time really intending to leave. After all, the guest at home was truly unsettling.\n\nCoincidentally, Dr. Lin came out of the elevator, her expression somewhat grave.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"How did you know Chen was pregnant?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"I've studied some traditional Chinese medicine,\" Zhou Ze fabricated. \"How is the situation over there?\"\n\n\"Chen wants to keep the baby, but it's hard to say if she can. She wasn't paying any attention to it before,\" Dr. Lin said, then added to Zhou Ze, \"Are you heading back? Wait for me to change, I'll give you a ride.\"\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze left the hospital in Dr. Lin's Cayenne.\n\nNeither of them spoke much on the way. Their \"marital\" relationship had hit rock bottom after the last incident.\n\nAs they neared the bookstore, Zhou Ze felt he should find a topic to talk about, otherwise it would be too depressingly quiet. He said, \"You've posted a lot of Hanfu photos on your Moments.³ Do you like it a lot?\"\n\n\"Mhm,\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\n\"I quite like it too.\" Zhou Ze rubbed the tip of his nose. \"Do you have any Hanfu? Maybe you could wear it for me to see someday?\"\n\nDr. Lin didn't answer, seemingly unwilling to engage with the topic.\n\nThe car stopped in front of the bookstore. Zhou Ze got out. To his surprise, Dr. Lin also got out, looking like she intended to go into the bookstore with him.\n\n*Heh, this woman is really tough. Isn't she afraid of getting... you-know-what... by me again like last time?*\n\n\"I'm going to grab a few magazines to read at work,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded. He knew this was Dr. Lin's way of indirectly expressing reconciliation. This woman, she really didn't have it easy.\n\nTo put it in Lu Xun's style: This woman had once again bowed to the feudal rites—that is, to her nominal \"husband.\"\n\nIn ancient times, Dr. Lin would be a typical, pitiful woman poisoned and persecuted by feudal customs.\n\nPushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze was surprised to find Xu Qinglang sitting on a plastic stool, reading a book. But the book in his hands was clearly upside down. What the hell was he reading?\n\nXu Qinglang managed to squeeze out a smile at Zhou Ze, but it was uglier than a crying face.\n\nDr. Lin gave the man, who was prettier than most women, a couple of extra glances, then walked straight to the shelves to pick out magazines.\n\nZhou Ze handed Xu Qinglang a cigarette and asked in a low voice, \"What's with you? You look like you've lost your soul.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe sound of footsteps came from the top of the stairs. A woman in an ancient-style white dress gracefully descended, her posture elegant, exuding a natural tenderness.\n\nWhen she saw Zhou Ze,\n\nshe gave a slight curtsy,\n\nand said very respectfully,\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\nThe magazines Dr. Lin had just picked up,\n\nfell to the floor.\n\nAt the same time, she said coldly,\n\n\"Looks like I don't need to wear one for you.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Tear through the paper window:** A Chinese expression for breaking through a pretense or revealing a secret that everyone is aware of but no one speaks about.\n2.  **Let my Daoist friend die, but not this poor Daoist:** A cynical Chinese proverb meaning \"better you than me,\" used to describe someone who saves their own skin at a friend's expense.\n3.  **Moments:** The social media feed feature within the WeChat app, similar to a Facebook timeline or Instagram feed.",

    "content": "\"It seems I won't need to wear this for you after all.\"\n\nDr. Lin was indeed a very traditional woman, but she was not the kind of woman from ancient times who wouldn't dare utter a peep if her husband took a concubine, for fear of being labeled jealous.\n\nShe had her compromises, but she also had her principles.\n\nShe could force herself to accept Zhou Ze's violation last time; she could also force herself to slowly accept \"Xu Le\" (Zhou Ze) as he became more and more autonomous and assertive.\n\nBut she could not accept Zhou Ze having an affair. That was her bottom line.\n\nShe was angry.\n\nVery, very angry.\n\nShe even wanted to turn around and walk away.\n\nThe only reason Dr. Lin hadn't left was that she was waiting for Zhou Ze's response. No matter what, Zhou Ze should give her some kind of answer, and then things between them could finally be settled.\n\nEven if it meant facing her mother's accusations and her father's fury over the shame her marriage had brought upon their family, she was ready to accept it.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't respond.\n\nNo explanation.\n\nIt was as if he was tacitly admitting it.\n\nThe light in Dr. Lin's eyes immediately dimmed.\n\nHe wasn't even going to bother with an explanation?\n\nIn truth, Dr. Lin had misunderstood Zhou Ze. He hadn't processed the situation at all; he hadn't even noticed Dr. Lin's feelings.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, he felt like the hairs on the back of his neck were standing on end in terror.\n\nThis female corpse...\n\nwas actually alive!\n\nAnd it wasn't as simple as coming downstairs for a drink of water like during the day. She had actually walked right up to him, bold as brass, talking to him, interacting with him!\n\nWhen he recalled the \"wandering fingertips\" he had subjected her to during the day to \"awaken\" her...\n\nZhou Ze was instantly seized by an urge to bolt from the shop and run as far away as he could.\n\nNow he understood why Xu Qinglang had been sitting there so foolishly, holding his book upside down. The man didn't dare move a muscle!\n\nThe scene descended into an awkward silence.\n\n\"Hello,\" the female corpse said with a smile. After greeting Zhou Ze like a Japanese or Korean wife greeting her husband at the door with a \"You're home,\" she deliberately looked at Lin Wanqiu with a teasing gaze.\n\n\"Hello,\" Dr. Lin replied icily.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze took a deep breath. He reached out and pulled Xu Qinglang up, forcing him to his feet.\n\n\"Wanqiu, let me introduce you. This is my good friend and neighbor, the owner of the noodle shop next door who has over twenty demolition-compensated apartments, Xu Qinglang!\"\n\n\"Hello,\" Xu Qinglang said to Lin Wanqiu, but his eyes remained fixed on the female corpse beside him.\n\nHe was an utter mess, as delicate as a frightened little quail.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"And this...\" Zhou Ze gestured toward the female corpse, \"is Xu Qinglang's lover.\"\n\n\"Right... what?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned, but in the next instant, Zhou Ze's hand tightened slightly. Xu Qinglang stumbled and fell right against the female corpse.\n\n\"Right, this is my lover. Her surname is Bai, she's called Bai Su-Z... Bai Susu,\" Xu Qinglang said, looking at Lin Wanqiu while draping an arm over the female corpse's shoulder in a feigned show of intimacy.\n\nIn that instant,\n\nthe same icy chill from last night pierced him straight to his soul.\n\n\"Ah... ooh ooh ooh... hooh hooh hooh... mmm...\"\n\nAfter a series of shivers, Xu Qinglang let go of her hand and said, \"Haha, honey, you're so soft. I love touching you! Hahahahaha!\"\n\n\"You two carry on. Wanqiu, come outside for a second, I have something to tell you.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze grabbed Lin Wanqiu's hand and, regardless of whether she was willing or not, pulled her out of the bookstore.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le! I suddenly remembered something important I need to tell you too, like how I have too many apartments and was thinking of giving you one.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved as he made to follow Zhou Ze out.\n\nThe female corpse stood by, poised and serene, and didn't move.\n\nHowever, Xu Qinglang felt a terrifying chill wrap around his neck, as if he would be torn to pieces the moment he took another step.\n\nXu Qinglang wisely chose to stop, then forced a laugh.\n\n\"Honey, don't be mad, haha. How could I give a house away? We'll wait until the country lifts the twenty-child limit, and then we'll pass them all down to our kids. You'll even get a Hero Mother medal then.\"\n\nHis face a mask of misery, Xu Qinglang sat back down on the plastic stool.\n\nZhou Ze pulled Dr. Lin's hand, walking her out of the bookstore and all the way to where her car was parked by the road.\n\n\"What is it? Go on, say it,\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"You seem to have put on some weight recently. You should stop eating late-night snacks.\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze pushed Dr. Lin toward her car.\n\n\"Hurry up and drive home. If you're bored at night, go for a run or jump some rope or something.\"\n\n\"What on earth is going on?\" Dr. Lin grabbed Zhou Ze, who was about to turn back to the bookstore.\n\n\"Don't worry about it. Just go, now,\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nDr. Lin didn't say anything more. She got into her car, started the engine, and after one last, deep look at Zhou Ze, she drove away.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh, then squatted down by the roadside and lit a cigarette.\n\nTo be honest, he didn't want to go back to the bookstore. Reason told him that leaving with Dr. Lin was the wisest choice. But he couldn't. He was the one who had dug the female corpse out of that plot of land.\n\nZhou Ze didn't have a savior complex; he actually hated trouble. But regardless, even setting aside his temporary status as a Hell-Servant, if he let the female corpse run rampant and cause trouble in Tongcheng, his hometown, he really wouldn't be able to live with himself.\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang, who was still in the bookstore...\n\nOh.\n\nXu Qinglang was still in the bookstore. Almost forgot.\n\nStill so pathetic.\n\nEven after dying,\n\nstill so pathetic.\n\nHe exhaled a smoke ring, dropped the cigarette butt on the ground, and stamped on it forcefully. Then, Zhou Ze walked straight toward the bookstore.\n\nAs he pushed open the door, a black light began to swirl in his eyes, and at the same time, his fingernails grew out.\n\n\"You're back again.\"\n\nThe female corpse was still standing there, her posture beautiful, but the teasing look in her eyes was much clearer than when Dr. Lin had been present.\n\n\"Get your ass back upstairs and lie down obediently,\" Zhou Ze ordered, pointing at the female corpse. Win or lose, it never hurt to act tough first.\n\n\"Do you guys prefer Durex or Jissbon?¹ I have both at my place, I can go get them for you.\"\n\nSaying this, Xu Qinglang tried to stand up and leave again.\n\nHe regretted it deeply.\n\nHe should have moved out during the day. Why did he have to linger here?\n\nHowever, the female corpse shot out a hand and grabbed at Xu Qinglang.\n\nA sharp cry escaped Xu Qinglang's throat: \"Boundless Heaven and Earth, Mystic Heart's Righteous Law!\"\n\nA bronze mirror appeared in Xu Qinglang's hand, pointed at the female corpse.\n\nBut in that instant, the bronze mirror shattered. Xu Qinglang was sent flying, crashing against the bookstore wall.\n\nThe female corpse's might...\n\nwas terrifying to behold!\n\nZhou Ze charged forward. This was his first real fight, and frankly, he had no confidence.\n\nHowever, the female corpse's gaze fell specifically on Zhou Ze's hands. She began to retreat, not daring to take a single step forward.\n\n\"Cough, cough...\"\n\nXu Qinglang climbed up from the floor, one hand on his lower back. He had expected Zhou Ze to be swept aside just like him, but instead, he saw Zhou Ze relentlessly forcing the female corpse back. An imbalance grew in his heart.\n\n\"Damn it, you can't go easy on him!\"\n\nFinally, the female corpse was pushed back against a wall. But in the next moment, she finally snapped and lunged at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively reached out and swiped forward.\n\n*CRACK...*\n\nWith a sharp sound, the female corpse was slammed hard against the wall, which even caved in slightly.\n\nThe white dress over the fallen corpse's chest was torn open. If not for the undergarment she wore, she would have been completely exposed.\n\n\"Damn, he's that strong!\" Xu Qinglang stared, dumbfounded.\n\nAt the same time, the thought that he had once planned to use force on Zhou Ze to find out the secret of his reincarnation sent a wave of fear through him.\n\nThis neighbor of his, he had never really fought before. Xu Qinglang was certain that Zhou Ze's earlier fear and apprehension of the female corpse had not been an act.\n\nThe reason was simple.\n\nThis neighbor of his had no idea he was so good at fighting!\n\nIndeed, Zhou Ze didn't know how to fight.\n\nHe grew up in an orphanage, a very clean one where the children got along well, knowing how to care for and encourage one another. As an adult, he became a doctor, a job dedicated to saving lives. He had no interest in boxing or MMA in his spare time.\n\nAnd so,\n\nnow that Zhou Ze actually had to fight, he himself felt his technique was a bit ugly.\n\nBecause the female ghost was afraid of his fingernails, his fighting style was like two shrews scratching at each other's faces, completely lacking the bearing of a Hell-Servant.\n\nCompared to the little loli who could just open her mouth, coolly chant, \"Order in the Underworld, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" and look totally badass, his style was leagues below.\n\nBut none of that mattered right now. As long as it was effective.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, who had walked back in expecting to be torn to shreds by the female corpse, the current situation was truly wonderful.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe female corpse was sent flying again. Every time she got near Zhou Ze's fingernails, the black aura on them would instantly pierce her body, causing immense damage.\n\n\"Boundless Heaven and Earth, Mystic Heart's Righteous Law!\"\n\nTwo paper talismans appeared in Xu Qinglang's hands. He slapped them onto the floor, and for a moment, the chill in the bookstore seemed to recede. Every time the female corpse landed, the talismans would tremble, and the spot beneath her would grow hot, as if a fire were burning there.\n\nThe female corpse's gaze sharpened. She no longer dared to face Zhou Ze and chose instead to break through from the side. She moved with incredible speed, intending to shatter the bookstore's glass door and escape.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was getting more and more into the swing of things.\n\nAs the saying goes, even if you've never eaten pork, you've seen a pig run, right?\n\nFrom the Hong Kong films of his childhood to later martial arts and cultivation movies, everyone had seen enough to get the general idea.\n\nZhou Ze threw his hands out to the side, his dark eyes fixed on the entrance.\n\nWhen the female corpse tried to smash through the glass door, streaks of black light suddenly appeared on the glass, as if they were scratches left by fingernails.\n\nThe female corpse let out a piercing shriek and was thrown back violently, landing on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze slowly advanced, steadying his own breathing.\n\nHowever, the \"recaptured\" female corpse suddenly knelt on the floor. Pointing one finger at Zhou Ze, she covered her face with her other hand.\n\n\"Sob... sob... sob...\"\n\n\"I'll beat you to death, you whimpering monster!\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out another talisman.\n\nBut the female corpse just pointed at Zhou Ze and began to cry with extreme grievance:\n\n\"You touched me, and then you hit me! You're not human!\"\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched involuntarily.\n\nFor the female corpse who had just exerted such immense pressure and terror on him and Xu Qinglang to suddenly adopt such a pose truly felt like a breakdown in style.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still replied seriously, his voice deep:\n\n\"I'm a ghost.\"\n\n---\n**PS:** Asking for recommendation votes! Throw them all at me! Dragon just discovered we got knocked out of the #1 spot on the new book chart.\nSo... let's take it back.\n\n---\n¹ Durex and Jissbon (杰士邦) are popular condom brands in China.",

    "content": "\"I was merely trying to tease you, Sir. Why must you be so heavy-handed?\"\n\n\"You are truly a cruel and faithless man, Sir. You touched me, you took liberties with me, and then you turned around and denied everything. And you even took your anger over your wife out on me.\"\n\nThe female corpse muttered to herself, tears streaming down her face. She looked utterly wretched and miserable. Paired with the white dress on her body, now practically torn to shreds, she was a truly pitiable sight.\n\nIt is often said that people who live to their seventies or eighties become as cunning as foxes. The female corpse before them had lived for two hundred years, weathering the great changes of time.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the female corpse's \"lament\" and turned his head to look at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Can we kill her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"...\" The female corpse.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, then nodded.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The baleful energy within her body is a problem. If she were to disperse it through self-destruction at the last moment, it would certainly affect the nearby innocents,\" Xu Qinglang explained. \"That would be a lot of trouble.\"\n\n\"Mmhmm,\" the female corpse chimed in. She had more or less given up on playing the sympathy card with Zhou Ze. *The heartless are the most faithless lovers.* Clearly, Zhou Ze was now on her blacklist.\n\n\"But she wouldn't dare pull a stunt like that. Her soul is already in Hell. If she were to commit any wicked deeds in the mortal world, the her in Hell would also suffer punishment. So, yes, she can be killed.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had a cigarette dangling from his lips. Earlier, he'd been as panicked as a quail about to be ravaged, but now, with Zhou Ze—who'd had his own little cosmic outburst—by his side, he could afford to be a spectator and make some wisecracks.\n\n\"Don't kill me, don't kill me! She is she, I am I! We're two different people!\"\n\nThe female corpse cried out hastily. She could tell that the two men before her truly wanted to solve the problem of her existence once and for all.\n\nEvery sentient being has a survival instinct, and the female corpse was no exception.\n\n*A thousand sails pass by the sunken ship; ten thousand saplings thrive beyond the withered tree.*\n\nThe female corpse was not, in fact, Madam Bai. To a certain extent, she was an independent being, a \"sentient consciousness\" born from Madam Bai's physical body over two hundred years. However, the female corpse and Madam Bai were still linked by innumerable ties.\n\nXu Qinglang was right. The female corpse did not dare to do anything excessive in the mortal world. Even in death, she would not choose to act wantonly and cause the Madam Bai in Hell to suffer punishment.\n\nZhou Ze crouched down in front of the female corpse. \"Then what did you mean just now? Was it all just for fun?\"\n\nThe female corpse nodded.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze chuckled twice. Thinking back, he was still a bit too \"young.\" As a new Hell-official without experience, he'd been foolish to agree to Madam Bai's request.\n\n\"Isn't there any way to control her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"You could extract a wisp of her Zombie Soul Blood. That would allow you to control her, but she has to give it to you willingly,\" Xu Qinglang suggested from the side.\n\nThe female corpse's head snapped up, a deep hatred flashing in her eyes. She stared death at Xu Qinglang, as if, in that moment, he were her greatest enemy.\n\n\"Either die or hand over the Soul Blood. You choose,\" Xu Qinglang said, a smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"You... choose.\" Zhou Ze also looked at the female corpse, clearly agreeing with Xu Qinglang's suggestion.\n\nZhou Ze was a neat freak. He had no desire for a repeat of the female corpse inexplicably coming downstairs to clean his cup with her tongue.\n\n\"Fine. I'll give it to you.\" The female corpse took a deep breath, as if trying to bury her resentment and anger. Then, she closed her eyes. A moment later, a wisp of something resembling a red earthworm emerged from between her eyebrows.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pinched the thing with his fingernails, then pulled it out. He placed it in his palm; it felt a little warm, a little moist, and slippery.\n\nAfter giving up her Soul Blood, the female corpse's spirit immediately became utterly drained. She was on the verge of fainting, only managing to stay upright through sheer will.\n\n\"Go to the bathroom, clean yourself up, and then go lie down upstairs. From this day forward, you are not to take a single step out of this bookstore without my permission,\" Zhou Ze warned.\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\" The female corpse lowered her head, her posture utterly submissive. With her Soul Blood in his grasp, she had no choice but to yield.\n\n...\n\n\"Smack.\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed the bottle of liniment onto the table. He was supposed to be rubbing liniment on Xu Qinglang, but listening to him, it sounded like he was doing something disgusting.\n\n\"Rub it on yourself.\"\n\n\"Hey, don't be like that! You didn't get hurt, but I was thrown against the wall. I've got so many bruises. Don't you have a shred of compassion?\" Xu Qinglang grew more agitated as he spoke. \"Zhou Ze, ever since you came here, have you noticed that I've been having nothing but bad luck?\"\n\n\"That's fate,\" Zhou Ze said, refusing to take the blame. \"By the way, that incantation you were chanting earlier... I feel like I've heard it somewhere before.\"\n\n*Heaven and Earth have no limits; the Mystic Heart is the True Law.*\n\n\"It's from a TV show. I thought it sounded cool, so I started using it. It doesn't actually help with casting spells at all,\" Xu Qinglang admitted honestly.\n\n\"So it's like adding your own BGM?\"\n\n\"Hmph...\" Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes and started applying the liniment himself. \"There's some plum juice in the kitchen. You can take it back with you. I'm not opening the shop tomorrow morning; I need to get more rest.\"\n\n\"I'm heading back to rest then.\" Zhou Ze stood up, grabbed the plum juice, and bid farewell. After returning to the bookstore, he went straight up to the second floor.\n\nThe female corpse had obediently washed herself squeaky clean and was now lying in the freezer, wearing Zhou Ze's clothes.\n\nThe white shirt was a bit large on her, the hem hanging down to cover the perky curve of her rear. She wasn't wearing any pants, her legs crossed as she lay there, her eyes full of seductive charm.\n\nZhou Ze tapped his finger on the side of the freezer. \"I remember Madam Bai saying she died before she was married.\"\n\nBecause of that, Madam Bai should have been a virgin, but the female corpse before him gave off a rather promiscuous vibe.\n\n\"That's because she didn't tell you that before her marriage, she had an illicit affair with an impoverished scholar. Her father found out and, feeling the family had been dishonored, forcibly drowned her.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you're a seasoned veteran, then?\"\n\n\"Of course. Do you know how much thought and effort she put in just to make me not look as horrifying as a drowning victim?\"\n\n\"Women, in the end, are vain.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Go to sleep.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze placed a pillow next to the freezer and lay down.\n\nHaving the female corpse next to him, the chill radiating from her body felt very comfortable, even more pleasant than lying in the freezer himself.\n\nHe slept soundly. When he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze opened his eyes to see a pair of long legs dangling leisurely in front of him. Even the curve of her toes was perfect.\n\nIf she were wearing stockings or high heels...\n\nWhen facing the female corpse, Zhou Ze found he could be more relaxed.\n\nSince neither of them was human, there was no need for pretense or hypocrisy, which made things purer.\n\n\"If you can't hold back, I can lie down. I know you really want to do that kind of thing. Holding it in for too long isn't good, you know. Especially since your body isn't the original model; otherwise, there could really be problems.\"\n\nThe female corpse spoke magnanimously, smiling as she added, \"Don't worry, I can't get pregnant.\"\n\nZhou Ze went downstairs to wash up, then started cooking instant noodles. Once everything was ready, he took out the plum juice and, with some difficulty, completed his morning meal task with the noodles.\n\n\"It must be painful, eating human food,\" the female corpse said, sitting on the stairs and watching Zhou Ze with her head tilted.\n\n\"It's none of your business.\"\n\n\"You're already dead, yet you insist on living like a person. Don't you find it tiring?\"\n\n\"You're talking a bit too much,\" Zhou Ze said with a slight frown.\n\n\"You said yesterday that I'm not allowed to leave the bookstore. So besides talking to you, what else can I do?\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the mop and broom from behind the counter and tossed them all to the female corpse.\n\n\"Do the cleaning.\"\n\n...\n\nThe sun was bright today. The female corpse was on her knees, wiping the bookstore's tiled floor with a rag, while Zhou Ze had brought a plastic stool outside to sit and bask in the sun.\n\nIt wasn't until noon that Xu Qinglang finally opened his shop door and came out. He took a cigarette from Zhou Ze, glanced at the scene inside the store, and smiled.\n\n\"Trained her well, haven't you?\"\n\nZhou Ze kept his eyes squinted, enjoying the sunlight.\n\nXu Qinglang blew a smoke ring, then, as if remembering something, said:\n\n\"Your sign is pretty good, very classy. It makes mine next door look inferior by comparison. I'm thinking of getting a custom sign made too.\"\n\n\"Trying to affect a refined air?\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"Why not?\" Xu Qinglang raised an eyebrow. \"If I put my twenty-something property deeds on display, who could say I'm not refined?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"Come on, help me brainstorm. I think yours, 'Listen with Skepticism; Thus Have I Heard,' is great. I'm thinking of 'Life is a Dream' for the horizontal inscription. How's that? Sounds grand, doesn't it? But for the couplet, I think it's best to have something related to 'eating,' so it fits my restaurant, right? I just haven't been able to think of a good one. Do you have any suggestions?\"\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment. \"You really want to hear it?\"\n\n\"Just say it,\" Xu Qinglang urged.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the female corpse inside the house and said:\n\n\"Man eats earth for a lifetime,\n\nEarth eats man but once.\n\nHorizontal inscription:\n\nLife is a Dream.\"",

    "content": "\"Here, have a taste. The new version of Sour Plum Juice.\"\n\nXu Qinglang placed a cup on Zhou Ze's counter. The sour plum juice looked richer and more mellow in color than the previous version. Swirling it in his hand, it felt like holding a glass of wine.\n\n\"What's different?\" Zhou Ze asked before drinking.\n\n\"The flavor is heavier, a bit like old yellow wine. The kick comes later. It'll keep you from wolfing down your food like you used to, improving your overall quality of life.\"\n\n\"Heh. What a clandestine... affair.\"\n\nThe female corpse, organizing the bookshelf nearby, chimed in sourly.\n\nZhou Ze took a sip. Unlike the sour plum juice he'd had before, this one was somewhat sharp and refreshing, with a sweet aftertaste. The flavor... was very good.\n\nHowever, this didn't seem to be the feeling he was looking for.\n\nBut just moments after savoring it, Zhou Ze felt a sharp, sour cramp in his gut.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nHis body began to tremble uncontrollably.\n\nThat lingering, sour aftertaste...\n\nSo domineering.\n\nHis fingers curled slightly, then slowly splayed open. Zhou Ze nodded, very satisfied.\n\n\"That was very thoughtful of you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You're too kind.\" Xu Qinglang smiled faintly. \"I'm planning to make this one of my signature side dishes. It's just a shame that there probably won't be many people who like this kind of flavor.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze agreed on that point.\n\n*Creak.*\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open and a group of students walked in. There were quite a few of them, seven or eight, and they all looked like the \"goody-two-shoes\" type.\n\n\"Boss, what's the WiFi password?\" a girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at the wall where it was written.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nThe students found plastic stools to sit on. Then, the girl took some homework out of her backpack and distributed it for the others to copy.\n\nWinter break was about to end, so this was a fairly normal sight.\n\nZhou Ze, of course, wasn't bored enough to go lecture these kids on the importance of studying and the evils of copying someone else's homework. He tapped his fingers on the counter, and the female corpse, taking the hint, walked over to pour him a glass of warm water.\n\nAt that moment, the girl who had led the group walked over to the bookshelf and casually browsed through the books. After picking out a few, she walked up to Zhou Ze. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Ninety-five,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Here, keep the change.\"\n\nThe girl was very generous, tossing down a hundred-yuan bill.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and said nothing more.\n\nBy the time it was past five in the afternoon, the students had all finished copying their homework and left. The bookstore returned to the quiet desolation it was meant to have.\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't in the shop; he had gone to order a custom sign. Of course, he wouldn't be ordering the one Zhou Ze had suggested—\n\n\"Man eats dirt his whole life, dirt eats man one time.\"\n\n—because anyone with a bit of common sense could see that such a sign was not suitable for a place where people ate, and was more fitting for either side of a tombstone.\n\nThe female corpse, on the other hand, was quite efficient at her work. Today, she had cleaned the entire first and second floors. Aside from occasionally striking a coquettish pose to show off her charms, she was basically flawless.\n\nShe didn't say where she was going to go, and Zhou Ze didn't ask.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze remembered Lady Bai's reminder: \"On the next Cold Clothes Festival,¹ burn the corpse with bamboo and wood.\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if Lady Bai knew that her corpse had, in fact, long since developed its own consciousness.\n\nIf she did know, yet still entrusted it to him, while also telling him the method and time for its cremation, what was he to make of that?\n\nLast night, the female corpse had also admitted that even if Zhou Ze were to strike her down, she would not self-destruct and let her baleful energy leak out, which would cause the innocent to suffer and implicate Lady Bai in Hell.\n\nHowever,\n\nit seemed Lady Bai simply wanted to dispose of this trouble of hers cleanly.\n\nFrom this perspective,\n\nthis female corpse he was using as a maid,\n\nwas actually a pitiable person.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My surname is Bai,\" the female corpse answered.\n\n\"Bai what?\"\n\n\"Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"Bai *Ying-ying*?\"²\n\nZhou Ze nodded. The name was a bit strange.\n\n\"Actually, you don't have to struggle so much when you eat.\" The female corpse stretched, her impressive figure becoming more prominent. \"It's just like how you can sleep so soundly when you're with me.\n\n\"Your soul is tainted with the aura of Hell, but your body is still that of a living person.\n\n\"You need to sleep and eat to replenish your physical body, but your soul doesn't need these things, so it instinctively resists and rejects them.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"From now on, I can feed you.\" The female corpse gave a shy smile. \"After food passes through my mouth and carries my... juices,\n\n\"it will be infused with the aura of a ghostly being. When you eat it then, it won't feel so unpleasant.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly understood why the glass of water last time had tasted a little sweet. It wasn't because the female corpse had a sweet mouth, but for this reason.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it.\"\n\nA man in a leather jacket walked in from outside the shop. He was dressed a bit tackily, his hair was disheveled, and his face was flushed, likely from having just been drinking.\n\nHe paced outside for two laps before finally pushing the door open and entering the bookstore.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't pay him any mind, but soon, his gaze sharpened slightly.\n\nHe knew this man.\n\nSun Tao, his former assistant, a... very promising young doctor.\n\nThe female corpse's eyes also narrowed. She gently poked Zhou Ze in the waist and whispered in a soft, glutinous voice,\n\n\"Sir, that thing... can I eat it?\"\n\nEat a person?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\n\"Sir, haven't you noticed? On that person's back.\"\n\nWith that reminder, Zhou Ze stood up and saw a pitch-black thing clinging to the man's back.\n\nAn ordinary person might not know what it was, because its shape was indeed rather abstract, somewhat resembling a black worm, but with certain peculiar, human-like features.\n\nBut due to his former profession, Zhou Ze recognized it at a glance—a premature infant.\n\n\"Wuu... wuu wuu...\"\n\nAs if it noticed Zhou Ze looking at it, the infant let out a faint cry.\n\nThe sound was somewhat familiar. Zhou Ze searched his mind for the relevant memory and finally, he found its source.\n\nNurse Chen.\n\nTo be precise, it was the sound that had once come from Nurse Chen's belly, though back then, only Zhou Ze had been able to hear it.\n\nZhou Ze felt no glee at his newfound ability to conduct \"paternity tests.\"\n\nWhat welled up in his heart was only sorrow.\n\nSo, the child couldn't be saved after all?\n\nWhen the female corpse said she wanted to eat it, she wasn't referring to the person, but to the soul of the infant boy.\n\nZhou Ze glared at her. The female corpse pouted, not daring to say anything more. She could only swallow her saliva in resignation, looking aggrieved as she placed a hand on her heavy chest.\n\n\"I don't eat the food of the living, and every night I'm used like a furnace for you to harvest my baleful energy.\n\n\"If I don't get some nourishment soon, these things will deflate. Then you won't be able to sneak glances at me while I'm working.\"\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily stunned. She had noticed his gaze all this time?\n\n\"You devil,\" the female corpse chided coquettishly.\n\n\"Boss, you got any booze?\" Sun Tao called out.\n\n\"Try next door,\" Zhou Ze replied, but still stood up and poured him a glass of water.\n\nAfter all, this was the kid he had once mentored. He himself had grown up in an orphanage, while Sun Tao had grown up in a single-parent home. Back then, he had ignored even a devoted fan like Doctor Lin, yet he had taken special care of this young man named Sun Tao.\n\nThere was no other reason than the fact that their personalities were very similar. Their childhood experiences had taught them the meaning of struggle and hard work; both wanted to fight to make something of themselves, to prove their worth.\n\n\"Pfft... Hahahahaha...\" Sun Tao took the water, drank a large gulp, and then burst out laughing. \"Boss, why are you looking at me like that? I'm not interested in men.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze grunted.\n\n*With such a handsome man living next door, I'm hardly going to be interested in you.*\n\nSun Tao sat down on a plastic stool, bit his lip, then shook his head.\n\n\"Boss, do you have any kids?\"\n\n\"We're not ready for one yet. He thinks I'm too young,\" the female corpse interjected, desperately trying to add herself to the drama.\n\nSun Tao looked up at the female corpse. Although her figure was full and she was tall, she looked to be about the age of a high school student. He immediately chuckled.\n\n\"You really are still young.\"\n\nThe female corpse turned away in a huff, then swallowed another mouthful of saliva.\n\n\"I was going to have a child,\" Sun Tao said, his voice tinged with emotion.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say, *You do have a child. It's hanging on your back.*\n\nWith the development of modern medicine and the \"modernization\" of people's thinking, abortion and induced labor were no longer such jarring terms. But few people understood that the resentment of an unborn infant was, in fact, the greatest of all.\n\nThese kinds of miscarried infants were the most likely to turn into ghostly beings, though, of course, their ability to seek revenge was actually very weak.\n\nAt most, driven by their resentment, they would linger around their so-called parents for a period of time before dissipating on their own.\n\nThe female corpse wanted to eat it because this type of infant, not having been fully born, was like an unsprouted seed. To beings like her, its \"nutritional value\" was extremely high.\n\n\"What happened?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"Did your girlfriend not agree?\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that although Nurse Chen had been anxious and shocked, she had said she wanted to keep the child.\n\n\"No, she was willing. But I wasn't. I chickened out. I made her get rid of the baby.\"\n\nFor some reason, Sun Tao felt a strong urge to talk to this bookstore owner. He found a familiar, big-brotherly feeling in him.\n\nAnd that big brother had already been dead for over half a year.\n\n\"You chickened out?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Her parents always looked down on me. Heh, their family... they're very well off.\" Sun Tao raised his head, as if trying to hold back tears.\n\n\"But what's done is done,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"But I wasn't willing to use something like that to pressure her family. I don't want my colleagues, my friends, to think that I used such methods to marry into their family.\n\n\"I don't want people to think I'm a Phoenix Man.³\n\n\"I'm not after their family's money, or anything else.\n\n\"I don't want to get married and have a pair of in-laws looking down on me, not to mention their whole clan of relatives.\n\n\"I grew up in a single-parent household, so I understand better than anyone that dignity is something you have to earn for yourself.\"\n\n\"Even if she was willing?\"\n\n\"Her being willing is her business. But I wasn't willing. I want to live with my own dignity.\n\n\"Heh, when I first started, an old big brother told me that dignity, and how others treat you, are things you have to earn with your own two hands. I haven't achieved anything yet, so I don't want to...\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then asked, \"Did that big brother of yours ever tell you one more thing?\"\n\n\"What?\" Sun Tao asked, surprised.\n\n\"And that is: when you're having your fun, don't forget to wear a... ...condom.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze swung his fist and smashed it right into Sun Tao's face.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nSun Tao, inexplicably hit with a heavy punch, fell to the ground, completely dazed.\n\n\"Don't make excuses. Don't talk about dignity. Don't say anything else.\n\n\"You're just selfish. Utterly and completely selfish.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze kicked Sun Tao again as he lay on the floor.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nSun Tao curled up. He was in pain, and also drunk, but he still shouted in anger,\n\n\"Are you crazy? Hitting people!\"\n\n\"That's right, I am crazy. I was fucking blind back then, to even think of mentoring and helping you out!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe curled-up mass that had been hanging on Sun Tao's shoulder crawled in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nIt let out a \"zeezeezeezee\" sound from its mouth.\n\nThe female corpse heard it.\n\nZhou Ze heard it too.\n\nBut Sun Tao couldn't hear it.\n\nHis unborn child, who had never truly seen this world,\n\nwas at this moment baring its teeth,\n\nat the man who was hitting its father,\n\nletting out an angry cry...\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ **Cold Clothes Festival (寒衣节 Hán Yī Jié):** A traditional Chinese festival on the first day of the tenth lunar month, where people honor their ancestors by burning paper clothes for them to wear in the afterlife to stay warm during the coming winter.\n\n² **Yingying (鶯鶯 vs. 嚶嚶):** The name uses the character for \"oriole\" (鶯), but Zhou Ze mishears it as a homophone (嚶) which is an onomatopoeia for whimpering or a cute, coy sound, often used online. It's a pun on her name.\n\n³ **Phoenix Man (鳳凰男 fènghuáng nán):** A modern Chinese slang term for a man from a poor, rural background who gets a good education and moves to the city (\"flies out of the nest like a phoenix\"). It often carries the negative connotation of a social climber who, after marrying a wealthier urban woman, is expected to use her family's resources to support his own large, poor, extended family. Sun Tao is saying he doesn't want to be perceived this way.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze sat down and didn't continue the beating. Indeed, he really had no reason to hit the man. Whether or not to have a child was their own freedom, a right they could exercise.\n\n  Besides,\n\n  now even the only real victim,\n\n  wasn't willing to lift a hand himself.\n\n  \"Heh...\"\n\n  Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n  Sun Tao scrambled up from the floor, pointed at Zhou Ze, and yelled, \"What's wrong with you? I'm calling the police! I'm going to get my injuries examined.\"\n\n  \"You deserved it,\" Zhou Ze said, exhaling a smoke ring without even looking up.\n\n  \"You... you... you...\" Sun Tao pointed at Zhou Ze, then shoved the bookstore door open and walked out. He cursed his luck inwardly; why on earth had he inexplicably come to this bookstore today?\n\n  The infant tried to follow him out, but Zhou Ze grabbed it.\n\n  The infant struggled, clearly unhappy, but Zhou Ze ignored its reaction and kept it pinned to the floor.\n\n  \"What are you following him for?\" Zhou Ze said. \"Keep it up, and you won't even have a chance at a next life.\"\n\n  \"Squeak... squeak... squeak...\"\n\n  The infant continued to struggle, completely deaf to Zhou Ze's words.\n\n  \"Lord Emissary.\" The female corpse sidled up to Zhou Ze, making eyes at him in a clear attempt to curry favor. Apparently, she thought Zhou Ze was keeping the infant for her nourishment.\n\n  It's true, isn't it?\n\n  Most men have a development fantasy of sorts.\n\n  The female corpse felt she was a perfect candidate,\n\n  both in terms of age and figure.\n\n  \"Lord Emissary... mmm... ah... Boss... mmm... ah... ah...\"\n\n  The female corpse swayed her body, giving a perfectly timed jiggle.\n\n  Then, the mind wished for stillness, but the flesh would not stop;\n\n  It was a magnificent spectacle.\n\n  \"A girl can keep growing, you know, as long as the nutrition is good.\"\n\n  \"Get lost.\"\n\n  \"...\" The female corpse.\n\n  \"Help me watch him. Don't let him run. If you sneak a bite, you'll die right along with him,\" Zhou Ze said, standing up expressionlessly.\n\n  \"Yes, Boss.\"\n\n  The female corpse had no choice but to squat down and grab the infant with both hands.\n\n  \"Boss, he's not actually going to call the police, is he?\" The female corpse was afraid of trouble.\n\n  \"He won't. His type wouldn't make a scene and let the whole world know he got beaten up while drunk.\"\n\n  \"Heh. What a slave to his pride,\" the female corpse said with contempt.\n\n  Actually, there was something Zhou Ze didn't say. That guy's personality was, in fact, just like his own used to be.\n\n  Zhou Ze looked at the palm of his right hand, slowly closed his eyes, and silently recited something in his mind. Then he opened his eyes again.\n\n  Mm,\n\n  nothing happened.\n\n  Next, Zhou Ze squatted down, extended his palm, and reached toward the infant.\n\n  Mm,\n\n  still nothing happened.\n\n  The female corpse holding the infant was baffled at first, but she quickly realized what Zhou Ze was trying to do. Her body trembled slightly as she struggled to keep from laughing.\n\n  Zhou Ze glanced at the female corpse. \"If you can't hold it in, then don't.\"\n\n  Indeed, Zhou Ze himself couldn't help but smile wryly.\n\n  The little loli had said she'd put the key to the Gates of Hell in his hand, yet now that he was trying to open the gate and send a ghost through for the first time, he had no idea how to do it.\n\n  In any case, it was unlikely the little loli was just playing a simple prank on him, printing something like a tattoo on his hand for no reason.\n\n  \"Hahahahahaha... How could this servant possibly dare to laugh at you, Boss... Hahahahahaha... I wouldn't dare be disrespectful to the Boss... Hahahaha-ha.\"\n\n  \"Alright, do you know how to open it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  The female corpse shook her head. \"Boss, I really don't know about this. Maybe... there's an incantation?\"\n\n  Hearing this, Zhou Ze silently recalled the scene Xu Qinglang had described, when the little loli had taken his parents' souls.\n\n  Immediately, he spread his hand open and said in a deep voice:\n\n  \"The Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed.\"\n\n  *Whoosh...*\n\n  Outside the glass door, a dry yellow leaf blew past.\n\n  A crow even seemed to fly away, cawing, \"Caw... caw... caw...\"\n\n  Inside the bookstore, it remained deathly quiet.\n\n  In short, still no reaction.\n\n  \"Maybe try a different incantation?\" the female corpse suggested. \"Everyone has their own preferred model, don't they?\"\n\n  \"What do you want me to do, shout 'Open Sesame'?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n  \"Well, that depends on what position the Boss prefers.\"\n\n  The female corpse had an expression of childlike innocence.\n\n  Zhou Ze remembered that during the fight that night, Xu Qinglang had also shouted an incantation, \"Limitless Heaven and Earth, Mysterious Heart of True Law!\" before producing a talisman and a bronze mirror.\n\n  But as Xu Qinglang had said afterward, he only used it because he'd seen it in a TV show and thought the two lines had a lot of style, much like a protagonist's BGM in a movie.\n\n  In reality, it was fucking useless.\n\n  Thinking about it now, the \"Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed\" that the little loli said while sticking out her tongue was probably also just something to add to her style.\n\n  It seemed the little loli's sense of humor was no different from Xu Qinglang's, even though she was a senior ghost emissary.\n\n  With a thought from Zhou Ze, the nail on his left index finger began to grow longer.\n\n  The female corpse showed a look of fear. She was afraid of Zhou Ze, but what she feared most was his fingernail. It possessed an aura that terrified her.\n\n  This made even Zhou Ze suspect that the old man who died in front of him might not have been so simple.\n\n  Stowaways came in two types. One was like his former self, forced to live with their tail between their legs. The other was like the one in Chengdu the little loli had mentioned, who stirred up so much trouble that even the ghost emissaries found it difficult and thorny to handle.\n\n  In any case, the old man who had infected him with the gray nail was probably not so simple.\n\n  The black nail pierced the mark in the palm of Zhou Ze's right hand. Then, as Zhou Ze pulled the nail out, he drew out a black thread.\n\n  It was like hot caramel, viscous but unbroken.\n\n  Zhou Ze used the pulled thread to draw a square,\n\n  and immediately,\n\n  the square began to float.\n\n  The inside of it turned black and cavernous, and gusts of ghostly wind began to blow out.\n\n  The infant in the female corpse's hands began to struggle. Clearly, it didn't want to go back to Hell.\n\n  Death is like a lamp being extinguished,\n\n  but not many can truly let go.\n\n  Countless people in their seventies or eighties, even those who have lived a life of utter wickedness, will still find ways to cling to life. Never mind this little infant.\n\n  But Zhou Ze knew that sending it to Hell to await a new beginning and reincarnation was the right choice.\n\n  There was no need to ask for its opinion. At this moment, Zhou Ze was being dictatorial. He snatched the infant directly from the female corpse and tossed it into the pitch-black square.\n\n  Afterward, the square slowly dissipated, leaving a faint burnt smell in the air.\n\n  The female corpse stuck out her tongue but said nothing.\n\n  Zhou Ze, however, was a bit lost in thought. In the end, this was the first time he had sent a ghost back to Hell. He hadn't even done this for the woman who had wanted to stay with her son through his college entrance exams.\n\n  \"Hell... have you been there?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"No,\" the female corpse answered honestly. \"And I can't go down there.\"\n\n  The female corpse had no soul of her own.\n\n  A Jiangshi does not belong to the five elements, nor does it enter the cycle of reincarnation.¹\n\n  That might sound impressive,\n\n  but it must be followed by this line:\n\n  Hated by humans, loathed by ghosts, and abandoned by Heaven!\n\n  This meant that if the female corpse went out for a stroll for no reason, there was a non-zero chance that a bolt of lightning would strike her out of a clear blue sky and reduce her to ashes.\n\n  This world was just that unfriendly to her.\n\n  Humans have the mortal realm,\n\n  ghosts have Hell,\n\n  and anything that belongs to neither is a heresy.\n\n  Zhou Ze sat back down behind the counter. He didn't feel happy, just a sense of tedium and boredom.\n\n  If the mortal realm was a production line, then all he was doing was tossing defective products into the incinerator to be melted down and remade.\n\n  \"Boss, there's a stack of this here.\"\n\n  The female corpse picked up a few sheets of hell money from the tiled floor and handed them to Zhou Ze.\n\n  Zhou Ze was a bit surprised; he hadn't expected to get paid this time.\n\n  \"The King of Hell is easy to see, but his minor demons are hard to deal with.\" The female corpse regretted her words as soon as she said them, but she forged ahead anyway, \"It's always been part of the deal for ghost emissaries to skim a little off the top when sending souls on their way.\n\n  \"I suppose his mother must have burned him paper money before.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze nodded and accepted the hell money. He had the hell money from last time in a drawer behind his counter; even with these few extra sheets, it was still not much.\n\n  \"Do you know any other friends? Refer some business to me. To be a person... oh no, to be a ghost, one must also read more books to improve oneself.\"\n\n  \"Boss, this servant only knows some lonely wandering souls. They lost their incense offerings long ago, so they have no money. Besides, they wouldn't dare come near you. If you were to collect them, wouldn't they just be padding your performance stats for free?\"\n\n  \"Performance stats?\" This was the first Zhou Ze had heard of it. \"Ghost emissaries have performance stats?\"\n\n  \"Don't they?\" the female corpse asked, looking a little puzzled.\n\n  \"I have no idea,\" Zhou Ze shrugged. He truly didn't know, because the little loli had just left him with a \"You're the most self-aware person I've ever met\" and then:\n\n  *Biu*\n\n  —she was gone.\n\n  She hadn't left him a *Ghost Emissary Code of Conduct* or a *How to Be a Ghost Emissary with Ideals, Ambition, and Purpose*.\n\n  \"I suppose there must be,\" the female corpse said with some difficulty. \"It's like with my former mistress. She lingered in the mortal realm for two hundred years, protecting the local region, working diligently, all in the hopes of atoning for the sin of her lingering after she returned to Hell, while also securing an official post for herself.\n\n  \"If her temple hadn't been destroyed back then and the incense offerings had continued, it wouldn't have taken her nearly so long.\"\n\n  \"Do you know any other ghost emissaries?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"How could this servant possibly know so many Lord Emissaries?\"\n\n  \"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded. Looked like he would have to find someone in the know to ask in the future.\n\n  Just then, the sound of an electric scooter came from outside. Xu Qinglang was back.\n\n  \"Oh man, I'm beat.\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang walked into the bookstore and tossed Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n  \"Didn't you just go to order a sign?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"I got that ordered, then I went to get some stock. Wanchai Ferry is having a sale, so I stocked up a bit more. It really wore me out.\"\n\n  \"Your dumplings aren't freshly made?\"\n\n  \"Hehe, the coke at a fast-food joint is just bought from the supermarket next door and resold. Where would I find the time to wrap dumplings at home every day?\"\n\n  \"Wanchai Ferry. Fits you perfectly.\"\n\n  \"Right? I like that flavor too... Hey, can't chat, I've got to go load up my freezer.\" Xu Qinglang waved goodbye to Zhou Ze and went back to his own shop.\n\n  After Xu Qinglang left, the female corpse suddenly let out a \"pfft\" of laughter.\n\n  Zhou Ze was a bit surprised. \"You got the joke?\"\n\n  The female corpse smiled.\n\n  \"He really is handsome, isn't he? Most guys would probably turn 'bent' for him.\n\n  \"So,\n\n  \"*Wanchai* Ferry.\"²\n\n  ——————\n\n  PS: In view of the fact that since the publication of this book, readers have often left comments in the review section saying \"The author plagiarized *He Comes from Hell*\" or \"The author's opening is very similar to *He Comes from Hell*\", Long will make a unified reply:\n\n  *He Comes from Hell* is a book written by Long.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ A *Jiangshi* (殭屍) is a creature from Chinese folklore, often translated as a \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\" The line refers to the Daoist concept of the Five Elements (Wuxing) and Buddhist reincarnation (Samsara), placing the creature outside the natural order of both life and death.\n\n² This is a pun. The brand name is 灣仔碼頭 (Wān Zǎi Mǎtóu), \"Wanchai Ferry.\" The character for \"Wan\" (灣) sounds identical to `彎` (wān), which means \"bent\" and is modern slang for \"gay.\"",

    "content": "In recent years, Tongcheng city has become famous for one thing in particular. It isn't its economy, nor its local cuisine, but its college entrance exams.\n\nFor most third-year high school students across the country, the Tongcheng Mock Exams are on par with the legendary Huanggang Secret Scrolls.\n\nOf course, none of this originally had any bearing on Zhou Ze. His bookstore had long since shed its reliance on \"business from the living.\"\n\nIt had already undergone an industrial restructuring and transformation, pivoting to make money from the dead.\n\nHowever, the same fatty who had sought him out once before had found him again.\n\nHis purpose was simple. With the next semester being the gaokao term, Fatty planned to pull off another big job: a pirated exam scroll business.\n\nThere were likely many twists and turns involved, perhaps even an extremely intricate chain of vested interests. Zhou Ze didn't really know the details; in fact, he was sure Xu Le didn't either.\n\nThe only reason Fatty wanted to pull Xu Le into the venture, both this time and the last, was to leverage some of Xu Le's classmate connections.\n\nIn this whole affair, Xu Le was essentially a middleman who satisfied both parties.\n\nA bit of a simpleton,\n\nbut that's what made him the most trustworthy.\n\nPiracy was an unavoidable hurdle in contemporary Chinese society. The so-called \"shanzhai\"¹ culture that stemmed from it seemed to be booming, so much so that the term was gradually shedding its negative connotations and becoming neutral.\n\nBut when all was said and done, it was still illegal. Although the current climate made the phenomenon almost ubiquitous, if you were unlucky enough to get targeted, it would inevitably be a huge hassle.\n\nZhou Ze turned Fatty down. Dejected, Fatty left. Standing at the door, he lit a cigarette, fiddled with his gold-flaked fake gold chain,\n\nand cursed,\n\n\"Dumbass.\"\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, just went back to sitting behind the counter and reading his book. Fatty's visit was merely a minor interruption in his routine.\n\nThe female corpse, as usual, sat in her chair after cleaning the bookstore, eyes closed and leaning against the wall, as if lost in thought or feigning sleep.\n\nThe lives of these two had taken on an air reminiscent of an old lady's foot-binding cloths—long and drawn-out.\n\nZhou Ze was perfectly content. He recalled how, in his past life, his greatest wish had been to live just like this: idling away the hours, wasting time, reading books, and daydreaming.\n\nNo need to be constantly ready for emergency patients, no need to push himself to climb the ladder, bit by bit.\n\nAs for the female corpse, she had already spent two hundred years lying in a coffin. She was long accustomed to monotony and silence. This was just a drop in the bucket.\n\nCompared to the \"still as water\" tranquility of the bookstore, Xu Qinglang was far more ambitious and driven. He was already wealthy and had no great aspirations in the world of metaphysics; instead, he was focused on how to make money and build a career through his own abilities.\n\nConsequently, Xu Qinglang was quite irritated by the decadent air of the master-and-servant pair next door!\n\n\"Look at you, lazy as a dead man every single day.\" Xu Qinglang, as was his routine after a busy day, came over to smoke a cigarette and shower Zhou Ze with some scorn.\n\n\"I am, in fact, a dead man,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand, blowing out a smoke ring.\n\n\"Look at you! A man who's lived two lifetimes, and you still barely have two cents to rub together. I'm a man with over twenty properties, and I'm still striving.\"\n\nAs was his routine, after belittling Zhou Ze, he had to praise himself.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang and chuckled. \"Are you preparing your own dowry?\"\n\n\"A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory,\"² Xu Qinglang retorted, raising his head to look at the night sky (the ceiling). \"I want my retirement to be more comfortable.\"\n\n\"Over twenty houses for the living was enough to attract a Ghost Madam to come carry you off in an eight-bearer sedan chair for marriage. If you keep working this hard, earn more money, buy more properties, maybe next time you'll attract a Ghost Queen or something who feels you're her social equal. Then I, a humble ghost emissary, can bask in your reflected glory.\n\nIf you get rich, don't forget your friends.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The feigning-sleep female corpse chimed in, perfectly backing up her boss.\n\n\"It's almost eight. I need to get ready,\" Xu Qinglang said, checking the time.\n\n\"For what?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\nNormally, Xu Qinglang turned in quite early for the night.\n\n\"Today's the day the Confucian Temple opens its gates. The gaokao is just a few months away, and a relative of mine back home has a kid taking it this year. They asked me to go burn some incense for him.\"\n\n\"You're willing to do that?\" Zhou Ze knew Xu Qinglang's temperament. Calling him detached and selfish was a bit much, but he was generally too lazy to bother with anything other than making money.\n\n\"I ate at their house when I was a kid, and they helped me out financially. Otherwise, I don't know if I would've survived long enough to see my own property demolished for compensation. So, I have to repay that debt,\" Xu Qinglang said with a straight face.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why don't you come with me?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly invited. \"Help me grab the first incense offering?\"\n\n\"The Confucian Temple cares about first incense too?\"\n\n\"Hey, it's a good omen, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm not strong enough.\" Zhou Ze had seen how crazy people got when fighting for the first incense. His physique couldn't handle it. Not unless he used his fingernails to clear a path, but he couldn't just go around knocking everyone down, could he?\n\n\"Ask her.\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the female corpse. \"She's strong as an ox. She can run interference for me.\"\n\nThe female corpse frowned, preparing a sarcastic retort.\n\n\"Don't you want to go out for a stroll?\" Xu Qinglang added with a wiggle of his eyebrows.\n\nThe words on the tip of the female corpse's tongue were immediately swallowed, her face blooming into a radiant smile.\n\nThese past days, she hadn't taken a single step out of the bookstore.\n\nWith no other choice, Zhou Ze had to agree. He didn't trust the female corpse to go out alone. She might be as attentive and obedient as a maidservant now, but you can never truly know what's in a person's heart—let alone in a *jiangshi* that has no heart to begin with.\n\nZhou Ze was even convinced that if his powers were to disappear one day, the first one to devour his flesh and blood would likely be this very same female corpse who was now so sycophantic towards him.\n\nThe three of them took a taxi to the Confucian Temple. To say it was a sea of people would be an exaggeration, but it was still surrounded by three layers of people both inside and out.\n\nThe things parents do for their children.\n\nOutside the temple, Xu Qinglang met up with the relatives he'd mentioned—a middle-aged couple who looked very honest and good-natured.\n\nTheir son, of course, hadn't come. Everyone was here to fight for a good omen; no one was foolish enough to believe this would actually guarantee a high score. You could barely see anyone of student age in the crowd; they were all presumably at home studying.\n\nThe Confucian Temple in Tongcheng \"washes its gates\" after the Lunar New Year. As for why not before, perhaps the old master sages in the temple felt that competing for incense with a bunch of ghosts, monsters, mountain spirits, and wild freaks during the New Year festivities was beneath their dignity.\n\nBetter to wait until after the New Year,\n\nto look upon the desolate and deserted gates of the others while their own temple overflowed with faithful devotees. Only then could they properly show off their class.\n\nAs for the specific reason, or how things were done elsewhere in the country, Zhou Ze had no idea. The whole point of a local custom was that it was a bunch of inexplicable rules. Who could really say for sure?\n\nIt was like that recent internet uproar about a father-in-law in a city next to Tongcheng who kissed his daughter-in-law at her wedding, claiming it was \"just a local custom.\" There was simply no reasoning with some things.\n\nWith a *creak*,\n\nthe red wooden doors opened.\n\nIn an instant, the waiting parents transformed into \"fierce beasts\" and charged into the Confucian Temple.\n\nThe female corpse led the charge, with Xu Qinglang and his two relatives close behind, evoking the grand image of Zhao Zilong at the Battle of Changban.\n\nZhou Ze didn't join the frenzy. He just squatted on the curb outside, smoking.\n\nAs he smoked, Zhou Ze was surprised to find the cigarette in his hand had suddenly gone out.\n\nHe relit it, but the next puff was utterly tasteless.\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze tossed the cigarette butt to the ground and glanced around. He knew what had happened. His cigarette had been taken as an incense offering.\n\nIt ignored the pure incense and paid no mind to the other offerings,\n\njust for a puff of a mortal's cigarette.\n\nWho knows what kind of ghost or demon it was.\n\nNaturally, Zhou Ze didn't feel any outrage along the lines of, \"Fuck, who dares steal my smoke?\" He had been an illegal stowaway just a month ago and had only been promoted to a temp worker two weeks later.\n\nHe possessed none of the \"when a man ascends, his chickens and dogs ascend with him\" arrogance, nor the typical protagonist's overlord aura.\n\nCLANG!\n\nA gong sounded, abrupt and ear-piercing in the night.\n\nZhou Ze followed the sound and saw,\n\nemerging from the flowerbeds behind the Confucian Temple, a short, dwarf-like old man. The old man held a bronze gong and had a cigarette dangling from his lips as he skipped and hopped his way out.\n\nThe old man shot a specific glance at Zhou Ze, then opened his mouth and puffed out a smoke ring, as if to say thanks for the cigarette.\n\nZhou Ze smiled back.\n\nHe lit the rest of the cigarettes in his hand with his lighter, one by one, and placed them on the ground, keeping only one for himself.\n\nSoon, the cigarettes on the ground all went out. The dwarf-like old man hopped even more cheerfully, seeming to take a greater liking to this junior who knew how to play along. His small pocket was bulging, likely full of cigarettes.\n\nThe dwarf-like old man cleared the way with his bronze gong,\n\nand behind him, a group of people slowly followed.\n\nThey weren't the parents who had just stampeded into the temple,\n\nbut a group of bizarrely dressed figures.\n\nAt the very front were several men in feathered fans and silk turbans, their steps faltering, their faces ashen, slowly following the old man's pace.\n\nBehind them were two men with greasy, long queues, their eyes vacant, also following the old man forward.\n\nThe figures that followed were dressed in progressively more modern attire. The last few were even wearing contemporary clothes, looking no different from ordinary high school students.\n\nHowever, some of their faces were a sickly green, while others had shattered skulls.\n\nOut of professional habit, Zhou Ze quickly deduced that the last few students had died either from poison or by jumping from a building.\n\nHe even recognized one of them. He seemed to recall seeing his photo in the news a few years ago—he had committed suicide by jumping off a building due to the pressure of a poor performance on a mock exam.\n\nThe dwarf-like old man walked forward, striking his gong, while the group of \"scholars and students\" behind him followed like puppets on a string.\n\nThey were like a parade procession,\n\ncircling the Confucian Temple.\n\nAnd of all the pedestrians nearby,\n\nonly Zhou Ze could see them.\n\nBANG!\n\nA gong sounded.\n\n\"To live in peace, you need not build a grand mansion; for in books, you will find a house of gold!\" the dwarf-like old man shouted in a hoarse voice.\n\nBANG!\n\nAnother gong sounded.\n\n\"To marry a wife, don't fret over lacking a matchmaker; for in books, you will find a beauty like jade!\"\n\nthe dwarf-like old man continued to shout.\n\nAfter circling the Confucian Temple three times,\n\nthe bizarre procession slowly vanished.\n\nA short while later,\n\nthe parents who had finished burning their incense began to walk out of the temple.\n\nTheir faces were filled with satisfaction,\n\nwith anticipation,\n\nwith the fervent hope that their children would become dragons.³\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ **Shanzhai (山寨):** A term for the culture of imitation and knockoff goods in China, which has evolved from a purely pejorative term to something more complex, sometimes implying clever adaptation.\n² **A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory (狗嘴裡吐不出象牙):** A Chinese idiom meaning \"nothing good can come from a filthy mouth\" or \"you can't expect kind words from a jerk.\"\n³ **Hope that their children would become dragons (望子成龍):** A famous Chinese idiom expressing the wish for one's children to become highly successful.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang and the female corpse, along with the middle-aged couple, all came out. The couple had gleeful expressions; clearly, with the female corpse's help, they had managed to offer the first incense.\n\nWhether it was effective or not, it was a good omen.\n\nEven parents who weren't superstitious would give their child a `zongzi`¹ and a New Year cake before a major exam, for the auspicious pun 'gao zong' (cake and zongzi), which sounds like 'gao zhong' (high school).²\n\nThe female corpse didn't look too happy. As the group walked back, she fell behind on her own.\n\n\"Let's go get a late-night snack. How about some barbecue?\" Xu Qinglang proposed.\n\nHe ran a restaurant himself, but there was no way he was going to prepare a barbecue late at night.\n\nHer Ladyship Xu's skin was far too precious. How could it endure all that smoke and fire?\n\nHowever, Xu Qinglang regretted his suggestion the moment he made it.\n\nIn this group,\n\nthere was a `jiangshi`³ and a living dead who didn't partake of worldly food.\n\nJust picturing the scene at the meal—those two sitting there motionless, like clay temple statues enjoying the incense offerings.\n\nThe thought of it was enough to kill one's appetite.\n\n\"You guys go ahead. We'll head back first,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, we couldn't possibly,\" the middle-aged man said.\n\n\"It's fine, uncle. We'll go eat. Let the young couple take a stroll on their own.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled the middle-aged couple along and left.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to hail a cab. He and the female corpse walked along a small, nearly empty road.\n\nThe weather was starting to turn warm, and the nights were no longer as chilly as before.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked the female corpse.\n\nShe had been sullen ever since they left the Confucian Temple.\n\n\"I feel uncomfortable,\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"Still haven't hit menopause?\"\n\n*It's been two hundred years.*\n\n\"...\" the female corpse.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, the female corpse finally spoke. \"A few of the statues in the Confucian Temple were staring at me. It felt strange.\"\n\n\"You think they were looking at you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Mmm.\" The female corpse nodded.\n\n\"You think they disliked you?\"\n\n\"Mmm.\" The female corpse continued to nod.\n\n\"You think that because you're a `jiangshi`, you shouldn't have been there in the first place?\"\n\n\"Mmm.\" The female corpse just kept nodding.\n\n\"The Sage advocated for education without discrimination.\" Zhou Ze smiled and patted the female corpse's head. \"You're a `jiangshi`, a creature loathed by both humans and ghosts. But you went to the Confucian Temple to help someone offer incense, which also contributed to their incense offerings and visitor traffic.\n\nYou think they were looking at you?\n\nIt was probably because you're special, so they were paying attention to you.\n\nIt's like if a husky suddenly appeared in a pack of prairie wolves. Anyone would take a second look, right?\n\nOf course, it's also possible that they're just a pile of clay. Rumor has it their eyes were made from balls of donkey dung because it makes them look more lifelike and glossy.\n\nAll of this is just you putting psychological pressure on yourself.\"\n\n\"But what if they really were looking at me? What if they really had a problem with me...\" the female corpse was still hesitant.\n\n\"Then they don't deserve to be enshrined in a temple as some damn sages!\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice was resolute.\n\n\"Sages enjoy the incense offerings of a thousand autumns and a hundred generations. If they don't even have that much magnanimity, what face do they have to sit on an altar in a temple?\n\nAnd what's there to be afraid of a fake sage?\"\n\nThe female corpse looked at Zhou Ze, a smile playing on her lips. \"Boss, what you just said was really domineering.\"\n\n\"But of course.\" Zhou Ze enjoyed his maidservant's flattery.\n\n\"But, Boss, you're a Ghost Emissary. Fate is preordained in the unseen world. For an ordinary person, the repercussions might not be great, but for you, it's different.\n\nBesides, you run a bookstore, a trade that falls under the good fortune and protection of the sages. Bad-mouthing them like this really isn't good for you.\"\n\nIt was rare for the female corpse to speak so earnestly to Zhou Ze. In the past, she would have been delighted to see him court death.\n\n*Go on, dance yourself to death! I'll be right there to collect your corpse, then I'll pull off your fingernails, grind them into powder, and use it like pearl powder to make tea. Oh, no—I'll feed it to the pigs!*\n\n\"It's like the old saying goes: if you've done nothing to wrong your conscience, you don't fear a ghost... or a sage, knocking at your door.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the streetlamp and continued:\n\n\"In my past life, I treated the sick and saved people. I never accepted red envelopes,⁴ never crossed my bottom line, and always abided by medical ethics.\n\nIn this life, even after becoming a ghost and being reborn in a borrowed corpse, I haven't done a single thing to weigh on my conscience.\n\nWhat is there to be afraid of?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and repeated, \"There's nothing to be afraid of.\"\n\nHearing this, the female corpse fell into deep thought.\n\nZhou Ze's words weren't some `chuunibyou`⁵ declaration, but more like a warning to himself.\n\nThe two continued to walk aimlessly. The evening breeze was slightly cool, but very pleasant.\n\nFinally, the female corpse stopped and asked, \"Boss, where are you going?\"\n\nZhou Ze stopped and subconsciously looked around, stunned to find that he had walked to the entrance of a residential complex.\n\nThe familiar surroundings,\n\nthe familiar guardhouse,\n\nthe familiar security guard napping on the job inside the guardhouse,\n\nthe familiar parcel lockers.\n\nHe had just been strolling,\n\nand had naturally walked back to the complex where he used to live.\n\nAlthough he had been at the bookstore for a month, in his subconscious, this was his home.\n\nHaving grown up in an orphanage, he understood the meaning of home better than most and, at the same time, was more attached to the idea of owning a house.\n\nFortunately, when he bought the house, Tongcheng's property prices hadn't yet soared to the absurd levels they would later reach. It was because he had been so eager to become a \"mortgage slave\" right after starting work that he had ended up picking a winner, making his colleagues who bought houses later quite envious.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze couldn't even recover his old WeChat or QQ accounts now. He couldn't get through the phone verification, and asking friends from his contact list to verify for him would either make them think he was a lunatic or scare them to death.\n\nEven his own house had been sold by the hospital on his behalf after his death, with the money donated to the orphanage in his name.\n\nZhou Ze didn't resent this; after all, he had no other living relatives.\n\n\"This is where I used to live,\" Zhou Ze said to the female corpse.\n\n\"Well then, shall we go up and have a look?\" the female corpse suggested.\n\n\"It's already been sold,\" Zhou Ze said with a sigh.\n\n\"Think of it as a trip down memory lane.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked over.\n\nHe entered Building 8, Unit 2, took the elevator up, and got off on the fifth floor.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to a door. The door was the same. The buyer probably hadn't had time to redecorate yet, right?\n\nEven the doormat was unchanged.\n\nAnd the potted cactus placed by the door was still there.\n\nZhou Ze reached out his hand, felt under the pot, and retrieved a key.\n\nBack then, he was often called to the hospital for emergencies at night and would frequently forget his phone or keys. So, he kept his spare key here to avoid locking himself out.\n\n'Might as well try,' he thought, inserting the key and turning it.\n\n*Click...*\n\nThe lock opened.\n\nThe door hadn't been changed,\n\nand the lock hadn't been changed either?\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. He pushed the door open and switched on the lights out of habit.\n\nThe furnishings in the living room were all the same.\n\nZhou Ze even saw his own slippers. He changed into them and walked in. The female corpse followed him inside.\n\n\"Boss, is it still the same as before?\" the female corpse asked.\n\n\"Yes, and that's what I find most strange.\"\n\nIt really was the same as before.\n\nBut that didn't make sense.\n\nAfter buying a house, wouldn't a normal person throw out all the belongings of a dead person?\n\nHow could they possibly keep everything, perfectly preserved? Weren't they worried about bad luck?\n\nPerhaps the person who took over his house was just using it for investment? And not actually living here themselves?\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the sofa, as if in that moment, he had become himself again.\n\nEvery time he came home exhausted, he would watch some TV, cook a late-night snack—life was hectic, but also fulfilling.\n\nThe female corpse went to boil some water, poured a cup of tea for Zhou Ze, and then said,\n\n\"Boss, you've been dead for over half a year, right?\"\n\n\"Seven months.\"\n\nZhou Ze answered, but why did this conversation feel a bit strange?\n\n\"But this place is so clean. It doesn't look like it's been unoccupied for seven months,\" the female corpse reminded him.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. That was true. The place was very clean; someone must be tidying up regularly.\n\nBut Zhou Ze found it hard to imagine that the person who bought his house would be too lazy to throw anything out or change anything, even keeping the original lock.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door and found that even the duvet and bedsheets were the ones he used to use.\n\n\"Boss, I'm going to take a shower. Being stared at by those old geezers in the Confucian Temple for so long gave me goosebumps.\"\n\n\"Go ahead. Turn on the water heater first,\" Zhou Ze reminded her. \"The bath towels are in the cabinet by the bathroom door.\"\n\nIf,\n\neverything really was set up the same as before.\n\nThe female corpse went to take a shower. She loved being clean. Women, by nature, love being clean. In her previous life, she had been a lady from a prominent family. Lying in a coffin for two hundred years without being able to bathe—how awful that must have been.\n\nSo she basically showered once in the morning and once at night, wasting a lot of Zhou Ze's water bill.\n\nBut when he thought about how she worked as a waitress in his store without asking for a salary, Zhou Ze just tolerated it.\n\nPulling aside the curtains, Zhou Ze stood on the balcony, looking out at the shimmering lights of the night.\n\nThis place,\n\nwas his home.\n\nIt hadn't changed,\n\nbut it no longer belonged to him.\n\nThe things remain, but the person is gone.\n\nThis was the truest sense of the phrase.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and blew out a smoke ring.\n\nHe felt a little lost. He thought he would have been able to let it go, but in reality, he couldn't.\n\nJust as he had personally cast that infant into Hell to await reincarnation, he now deeply realized that his lingering attachment to the world of the living, as someone who had been alive, was truly hard to describe in words.\n\nEven he, at this moment, felt an impulse to buy his house back.\n\nAs for money,\n\nwith his abilities, would it really be that hard to bend the rules and get some?\n\nThis impulse was suppressed with great difficulty. Zhou Ze knew that this was a path of no return, Pandora's box. Once opened, he would definitely not be able to stop himself.\n\nZhou Ze considered himself a self-disciplined person, but one should never test their own \"moral integrity\" if it can be avoided.\n\n*Click...*\n\nUnexpectedly,\n\nthe sound of a key entering the lock came from the door.\n\nThe owner's back?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and walked from the balcony back into the living room. He was thinking about how to explain his presence in the house to the owner, but he wasn't overly nervous.\n\nWhen all was said and done, he was a Ghost Emissary, after all. If he really got arrested for trespassing and taken to the police station,\n\nwouldn't that be selling himself short?\n\nSelf-discipline was one thing, but there was no need for self-torment.\n\nThis was, after all, his former home.\n\nHowever, when the door was pushed open,\n\nthe person who walked in,\n\nwas a familiar figure.\n\nDr. Lin stood at the doorway, looking at Zhou Ze in the living room. Shock and panic appeared on her face as she said,\n\n\"You... what are you doing here?\"\n\nZhou Ze was also at a loss for words for a moment.\n\nThe person who bought his house,\n\nwas Dr. Lin?\n\n\"Let me explain,\" said Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"Let me explain,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two of them said this at the same time.\n\nLin Wanqiu was in a panic because she thought Zhou Ze had found evidence of her \"emotional affair.\"\n\nHe had found this place. She was his wife, yet she had bought the house left behind by another man, and had been cleaning and tidying it all this time. Because of that man, she had refused to be intimate with her husband.\n\nDr. Lin felt she was deeply in the wrong.\n\nFortunately, this awkward atmosphere didn't last long,\n\nbecause something even more awkward happened.\n\n\"Boss, I accidentally got my clothes wet.\"\n\nThe female corpse, speaking as she walked, emerged wrapped in a bath towel,\n\nand stepped into,\n\nthe living room,\n\nstanding right between,\n\nZhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu.\n\n***\n\n¹ **`zongzi` (粽子):** A traditional Chinese food made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo or reed leaves.\n² **`gao zong` / `gao zhong` pun:** In Mandarin, `gāo zòng` (糕粽), meaning cake and `zongzi`, is a homophone for `gāo zhòng` (高中), meaning high school.

    "content": "The most frightening thing is when the air suddenly falls silent…\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Dr. Lin lowered her head, looking somewhat relieved as well.\n\nOne had an emotional affair,\n\nthe other a \"physical affair.\"\n\nWhen one person makes a mistake, it’s guilt.\n\nWhen two people make a mistake together, it’s gender equality.\n\nAt this, Zhou Ze started to laugh, a somewhat unrestrained laugh.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAfter he had died, the person who bought his house was, of all people, his current \"wife.\"\n\nIndeed, Dr. Lin was wealthy. It would be easy for her to buy a second-hand house in Tongcheng where the owner had died. And, it seemed, only she would bother to clean this place while keeping its layout completely unchanged.\n\nMoved?\n\nOf course, he was moved.\n\nZhou Ze was Zhou Ze. Even though he was now in Xu Le's body, he was still adopting the perspective of Zhou Ze himself.\n\nXu Le was already in the past. Regardless of how rocky or undignified that kid's love life had been, Zhou Ze wasn't going to dwell on it.\n\nIt was like during a New Year's Eve dinner, when everyone is eating together, and some dolt at the table suddenly pulls out his phone and says to everyone, \"Look at the starving refugees in some parts of Africa, thin as skeletons. How can you still have an appetite?\"\n\nTo have a woman like this, almost as if possessed, constantly remembering him, missing him…\n\nAs a man,\n\nhow could he not feel proud, not be moved?\n\n\"Find some of my clothes and change into them,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing at Bai Yingying.\n\nThe female corpse nodded. \"Oh,\" she said. This time was different from the last. She didn't dare indulge her playful nature and deliberately add fuel to the fire. She obediently went to Zhou Ze's bedroom, found some of his clean clothes, changed, and came out.\n\nDr. Lin remained standing where she was, saying nothing.\n\nShe seemed to feel a sense of release, a kind of relief. However, Zhou Ze didn't let her linger on this emotion. He walked forward, took her hand, and said very seriously,\n\n\"There's something I have to tell you. Come with me.\"\n\nGrabbing Dr. Lin's hand with a slight imperiousness, Zhou Ze led her out the door and into the elevator. Bai Yingying followed behind, not uttering a word. She knew that anything she said now would be a mistake.\n\nOne could only say that this was all too much of a coincidence.\n\nDownstairs, Zhou Ze walked over to Dr. Lin's Cayenne and held out his hand, gesturing for her to give him the car keys.\n\nZhou Ze had made up his mind. He was going to tell her his identity, regardless of whether she could accept it, regardless of whether she was like Lord Ye, who professed a love for dragons.¹\n\nIn short, Zhou Ze wanted to tell her the truth. He didn't want to be coy anymore, nor did he want to keep hiding things. After all, times had changed. Before, he was undocumented, but now, his identity was legitimate.\n\nThere was no reason to put himself through this.\n\n\"You don't have a driver's license,\" Dr. Lin reminded him.\n\n\"Give me the keys,\" Zhou Ze said forcefully, his tone leaving no room for argument.\n\nHe was going to take her to the hospital, to that familiar operating room, and use his actions to show her his true identity.\n\nOtherwise, he worried that if he simply tried to describe it with words, she might think he was having a \"pitiable husband's delusion\" episode.\n\nDr. Lin gave the car keys to Zhou Ze, and then all three of them got into the car.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the driver's seat, Dr. Lin in the passenger seat, and Bai Yingying sat quietly in the back.\n\nThe car started, reversed out of the space,\n\nZhou Ze looked skillful and at ease.\n\nThat dolt Xu Le didn't even have a license.\n\nHe, on the other hand, was a seasoned driver.\n\nAnd then,\n\n*Screeeeeeeech...* The piercing sound of scraping metal rang out, and the car's body shuddered.\n\nZhou Ze fell silent.\n\nThe other two women in the car also fell silent.\n\nThe Cayenne's side had scraped against a utility pole, grinding along its length.\n\nIn the dark night, it was as if a very diligent crow just so happened to fly by again,\n\nletting out a few \"Caw… caw… caw\" sounds.\n\nThe air, once again, fell into an extremely awkward silence.\n\nZhou Ze unbuckled his seatbelt. \"You drive,\" he said.\n\n\"To the People's Hospital?\"\n\nDr. Lin asked after they had swapped seats.\n\n\"Yes, the People's Hospital.\" Sitting in the passenger seat, Zhou Ze covered his forehead with his hand, then gently tapped his head against the car window.\n\nHe hadn't driven in too long, and on top of that, he was in a different body. His driving skills had gotten far too rusty.\n\nBut no matter how many excuses he had,\n\nthat was just really embarrassing.\n\nThe car got on the road and soon entered the East Expressway overpass.\n\nThe car was quiet. Dr. Lin didn't speak. Even though she didn't know why Zhou Ze wanted to go to the hospital, she didn't ask.\n\nTheir marital relationship right now,\n\nwas truly in tatters.\n\nBai Yingying sat in the back seat, looking at the scenery outside the window. It had been a long time since she had been able to come out. Although Madam Bai used to talk with her almost every day, she rarely had the chance to personally walk out and see the outside world.\n\nBesides, she knew it wasn't a good time for her to speak.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly sat up straight and said, \"Is that car driving the wrong way?\"\n\nOn the other side of the low concrete barrier was the opposite lane of the overpass. A white sedan was there, but its front was facing the same direction as their own car.\n\nThis meant it was driving against traffic.\n\nAnd just at that moment,\n\na large bus drove past in the adjacent lane, its high beams glaringly bright.\n\nImmediately following was the harsh screech of emergency brakes.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously shut his eyes and covered his head with both hands. The bus was in the next lane and couldn't possibly hit him, but this scene was almost the most terrifying image in his memory.\n\nHe himself had been hit by a large truck just like this on his way home from work.\n\nEverything happening now triggered the most horrifying memory he was most unwilling to recall.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA dull impact sound rang out. Dr. Lin immediately stopped the car.\n\nIn the adjacent lane, the bus had collided with the white sedan that was driving the wrong way. The small car was pushed forward, then its body was slammed hard against the concrete barrier by the front of the bus, completely deforming it.\n\nPutting on her hazard lights, Dr. Lin quickly got out of the car. Seeing her husband cowering and trembling in the passenger seat, a hint of disappointment showed in her eyes, but she still immediately opened the trunk, took out the warning triangle to place behind the car, and then quickly vaulted over the barrier to the other side.\n\nShe was a doctor; she needed to fulfill her duty. When an accident occurs, if there is professional medical help nearby, the victim's life has a much higher chance of being saved.\n\n\"Boss?\" Bai Yingying called out from the back seat.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his hands, looking around somewhat blankly. He saw the accident scene in the next lane, where Dr. Lin had already rushed over.\n\n\"Come with me. We need to save them.\"\n\nZhou Ze got out of the car, his legs feeling a bit weak.\n\nThis was a person's self-preservation instinct. When a psychological trauma is triggered, it often brings about a protective physical reaction of weakness.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze didn't hesitate for a moment and also vaulted over the barrier to help with the rescue.\n\nBai Yingying followed him over.\n\nThe bus driver also had blood on his face, likely from his head hitting the steering wheel or something else during the crash. Three other people, probably passengers, got off the bus. In any case, the bus was very empty.\n\n\"Are they fucking crazy? Driving the wrong way on an overpass! If you want to die, don't drag others down with you!\" the bus driver cursed, one hand covering the wound on his forehead.\n\nAnyone who encountered such bad luck would be furious.\n\n\"Stop shouting and help save them!\" Dr. Lin snapped at the bus driver.\n\nThe responsibility for the accident could be determined later. Right now, they had to get the people out of the car.\n\n\"Hey, are you conscious? Can you answer me?\" Dr. Lin yelled at the people inside the deformed car.\n\nBut she received no response.\n\nThe bus driver, though grumbling, joined in the rescue effort. This stretch of road was already somewhat remote, a section of the overpass with little traffic. The few cars that passed by didn't stop to look on curiously; they just drove away.\n\n\"Pry the car door open!\" Zhou Ze suggested.\n\n\"We don't have any equipment! How are we supposed to pry it open?\" Dr. Lin's emotions were running high, and she grew even more irritated when her husband, who didn't know what he was doing, tried to give clueless directions.\n\nThere were two people in the car, a woman and a child, and their situation was critical. Both were covered in blood and didn't respond at all to her calls.\n\nThe car door had been smashed inward and was practically stuck. This would require the fire department to come with specialized equipment to cut it open.\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward and grabbed the car door. Bai Yingying came over at that moment. As a zombie, she was naturally strong, and she pulled with Zhou Ze.\n\nWith a loud \"CRACK,\"\n\nthe car door was ripped right off. For good measure, Bai Yingying also pushed down the back of the car seat.\n\nDr. Lin stared, stunned.\n\nThe bus driver and the few passengers were also stunned.\n\nThey must have gotten lucky, and it was only lightly jammed.\n\nZhou Ze bent down, using one hand to support the victim's neck and the other to hold her legs, and carefully dragged the woman out first. Then, he went back to pull out the boy's body.\n\nDr. Lin first checked the woman's body, her expression grave. When the boy was pulled out, she checked him as well, and her face immediately fell.\n\nDead.\n\nThey were both dead.\n\n\"They're dead?\" the bus driver asked in disbelief, his face turning pale. He had really run into some rotten luck. \"These bastards, coming out at night to harm people! They've completely screwed me over!\"\n\n\"Call the police and 120,\" Dr. Lin, whose phone was still in the car, shouted at the bus driver.\n\nAlthough the bus driver was furious, he still took out his phone and started making calls.\n\nZhou Ze, however, turned the bodies of the woman and child over. Dr. Lin was puzzled by this action.\n\n\"When I pulled them out just now, I quickly checked them. They have many external injuries from the crash.\n\nBut they have one thing in common. At the back of their heads, both have a concave skull fracture. If I'm not mistaken, that was the fatal wound.\n\nI think it was likely caused by a hammer wrapped in cloth.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Dr. Lin immediately followed up by checking the wound in that location and instantly understood. \"They were already dead before the crash!\"\n\nYes, otherwise it would be very difficult to explain how both of them suffered the same fatal injury in the exact same spot. It was too much of a coincidence, so coincidental that it was virtually impossible.\n\n\"Dead people, placed in a car, which was then driven the wrong way.\" Zhou Ze looked at Dr. Lin with a smile. \"Then disguised as a car accident. A very well-staged incident.\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze turned his head and looked at the bus driver behind them, who was on the phone calling the police. The few passengers from the bus who had been standing around had also slowly begun to encircle them.\n\nThe bus driver looked back at Zhou Ze, a meaningful smile also appearing on his face. He spoke into the phone:\n\n\"Boss, we've hit a bit of a snag. Ran into some meddlesome, unlucky devils.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ \"Lord Ye's love for dragons\" (葉公好龍, *Yè Gōng hào lóng*) is a Chinese idiom describing someone who professes to love something but is actually terrified of it when faced with the real thing. Zhou Ze is wondering if Dr. Lin truly wants him back, or if she only loves the *memory* of him.",

    "content": "As a surgeon, Zhou Ze could easily spot the abnormalities in the corpse's death. Therefore, the forensic experts, whose job this was, would obviously be able to discover them too.\n\nAnd so, in Zhou Ze's view, the staging of this car accident was actually a failure. It was even \"all for show,\" unable to withstand any real scrutiny.\n\nWho knew if this group had other tricks up their sleeve to perfectly patch this case up as an accident, or if they were really just \"newbies\"?\n\nOf course, now was not the time to ponder this question, because it seemed this group had no intention of wasting any more time.\n\n\"Grab them, then drive their car away.\"\n\nThe bus driver glanced at the time. Time was precious now.\n\nA few of his men charged forward. To them, a scrawny man and two young women wouldn't be able to make a splash.\n\nBai Yingying tilted her head and glanced at Zhou Ze. She was waiting for his command.\n\nDr. Lin stood rooted to the spot. It was clear she was very nervous, but she didn't scream or shout. To be able to do this much was already quite impressive.\n\nMost people, faced with this situation, even those who usually boasted of being braver than the heavens, would probably find it perfectly normal to fall to their knees, begging for mercy and shouting, \"I didn't see anything.\"\n\n\"No killing,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Haha.\" The bus owner laughed upon hearing this.\n\nToo bad Zhou Ze's words weren't directed at him.\n\nBai Yingying responded with a \"You got it!\" and charged straight ahead.\n\nZhou Ze took a step back, grabbed Dr. Lin's hand, and said, \"It's okay, I'm here.\"\n\nCharging ahead, Bai Yingying nearly stumbled.\n\n*This old lady is charging into battle at the front, and you actually have the leisurely mood to be all lovey-dovey back there?*\n\n*A mistress—oh no, a maid has her dignity too, okay!*\n\nDr. Lin bit her lip. She said self-reproachfully, \"I'm sorry.\"\nShe had been the one to stop the car to try and save someone, which led everyone into this crisis, so she apologized.\n\n\"It was the right thing to do. An occupational sickness,\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile. At the movie theater last time, he had also rushed in just like this. All he could say was that some professional habits were truly impossible to change.\n\nHaving just been fed a mouthful of PDA, the female corpse's attacks became unconsciously heavier.\n\n\"Come here, little missy. Let big brother dote on you.\"\n\nA man opened his arms, preparing to grab this little high school girl.\n\nThe boss had told them not to kill anyone here, but to take them away instead. After all, they couldn't let things drag on here for too long.\n\nHowever, his arms embraced empty air.\n\nImmediately after, his left arm was grabbed by the female corpse.\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nHearing this, Dr. Lin's body trembled. Zhou Ze also found it a bit jarring.\n\nHe even thought that if Bugles¹ recorded their sound effects for commercials here, the result would definitely be better than their current ads. So satisfyingly crunchy.\n\nThe man's mouth gaped open. He couldn't even cry out in pain. The female corpse stepped forward again and kicked the man's lower leg.\n\n\"Crunch... crunch... crunch...\"\n\nAnother three crisp sounds.\n\n*Kobik² could also come here to record sounds for their ads*, Zhou Ze thought.\n\n\"I... fuck...\"\n\nThe man curled up on the ground, one arm completely disabled, the other leg completely broken. He was like a toad lying on the ground, able to do nothing but wail and squirm.\n\nZhou Ze felt not the slightest bit of compassion. He forbade the female corpse from killing because matters of the living world should be handed over to the police. He believed the country's judicial system would not let any evil hide.\n\nBut the people before him were, after all, cold-blooded murderers, and they had been about to make a move on him. Zhou Ze's heart wasn't overflowing with so much saintly empathy that he'd find their current treatment pitiful.\n\nWho knew what they had just been planning to do to the three of them?\n\nIf he were still that doctor from his past life, and the female corpse were just a high school girl, then who would have pitied them?\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nThe other two men were taken down directly. Same story: broken bones. Though not fatal, they were now crippled.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's professional perspective, even if these three on the ground were treated at a hospital, they would likely be unable to care for themselves for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe bus owner's phone fell and smashed onto the ground.\n\nHe subconsciously swallowed, feeling that everything before his eyes was so unreal.\n\nHe hadn't brought a gun. The plan was to face questioning and investigation from traffic police and law enforcement, so of course he couldn't bring any contraband.\n\nHe originally thought that even with the addition of these few \"warm-hearted\" people like Zhou Ze, things wouldn't change too drastically. Even if there was a change, he could still control it.\n\nHowever, the problem now was very severe, because this girl was walking towards him.\n\n\"I...\" The bus owner, whose acting had been so superb just now, couldn't even get a word out.\n\n\"Thump!\" The female corpse reached out, flipped the bus owner directly onto the ground, and placed a foot on his neck.\n\n\"Hold on,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\nThe female corpse stopped, not asking why.\n\nZhou Ze walked up, crouched down, and patted the bus owner's bearded face.\n\nThen he felt his action was rather pointless, and wiped his hand on the female corpse's pant leg.\n\n*This guy's face is so greasy.*\n\n\"...\" The female corpse.\n\n\"You guys, are there any others?\"\n\nWhat Zhou Ze had to consider now was how to eliminate all future trouble. He himself wasn't afraid of anything, but this matter couldn't be kept under wraps. What if he took care of the small fry, but the big boss got away and decided to target Dr. Lin for revenge?\n\nThere's no sense in guarding against a thief for a thousand days.\n\nBefore, the little loli had said there was another of his kind in Rongcheng who had overstepped his bounds and acted as a judge himself. Zhou Ze naturally couldn't follow in his footsteps.\n\nAlthough emotionally, Zhou Ze really admired him, thinking he was awesome and had big dreams.\n\nBut this matter had already affected his daily life. He had to personally put an end to it.\n\nThe female corpse brought her foot down directly onto the bus owner's left arm.\n\n\"Crunch...\"\n\n\"Ahhhh!!! No more, no more... It's just us! We all met while working odd jobs... It's just us! We were hired by an employer.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, then looked at the female corpse and said, \"Is there any way to make them not remember this?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't want trouble, and he certainly didn't want to be in the news.\n\nThe female corpse made a throat-slitting gesture.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. No killing. At least, not by his own hand.\n\n\"Alternatively, Boss, you could prick them with your nail. It would confuse their minds for a while, like they were drunk, and then they'd black out.\"\n\n\"How much should I prick them?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Just a tiny bit, or they might really die. Also, I know you don't want to attract trouble, Boss. After we go back, burn all your remaining paper money, and trouble won't come knocking. But then I guess no one will be tossing money at the shop's entrance anymore either.\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced up at Dr. Lin in the distance, then silently walked over to each of the thugs lying on the ground. He discreetly pricked them one by one with the black nail that had grown on his little finger. The men all trembled violently, foamed at the mouth, and quickly fell unconscious.\n\nBut none were in mortal danger.\n\nHe scanned the surroundings. There shouldn't be any security cameras here, otherwise they wouldn't have chosen this place to stage the accident. Zhou Ze picked up one of their phones, dialed the police, and then tossed the phone away.\n\nHaving done all this, Zhou Ze waved to Dr. Lin over there and got back into her car.\n\nDr. Lin also got into the driver's seat.\n\n\"Let's go, don't stop here,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Okay.\" Dr. Lin took a deep breath and started the car.\n\n\"Don't tell anyone about this,\" Zhou Ze reminded her as the car was moving.\n\n\"Why?\" Dr. Lin clearly didn't quite understand.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the back seat.\n\n\"She's a successor of Tai Chi Baguazhang. She accidentally crippled someone during a martial arts match and had to flee to my place for refuge. She's the one who saved me just now, so our identities can't be exposed, or else she'll be taken away by the police.\"\n\nThe female corpse in the back rolled her eyes.\n\n*Who is he trying to fool with that story? A ghost?*\n\nDr. Lin remained silent. It was unknown whether she actually believed him; she just continued to drive in silence.\n\nThe car was still heading towards the People's Hospital. For Dr. Lin, even if Zhou Ze hadn't initially said to go there, she would have subconsciously driven there anyway. After all, it was her workplace, a place where she could feel safe.\n\nThe car entered the People's Hospital parking lot, and all three of them got out.\n\nDr. Lin didn't ask Zhou Ze where he was going. She couldn't have guessed that the place Zhou Ze wanted to go was actually the emergency room. She just walked forward in silence.\n\nThe female corpse leaned close to Zhou Ze's ear and said, \"Are you still going to confess tonight?\"\n\nShe was very smart. From details like Lin Wanqiu buying Zhou Ze's former house, she had already deduced a lot of the inside story.\n\n\"It's not a Qiong Yao drama,³ why would I make things so tragic?\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nAlthough there had been a small hiccup on the road that left Dr. Lin still a bit shaken, Zhou Ze had no intention of abandoning his original plan.\n\nA woman like this, who was also the legal wife of his current body...\n\nIf he didn't tell her the truth so she could sleep with him at night with a clear conscience,\n\nhad his brain gone soft?\n\nHiding things back and forth, full of twists and turns, moving and tear-jerking, and then hysterical outbursts—that was the kind of formula Qiong Yao liked. He, Zhou Ze, did not.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on a bench near the parking lot exit. Zhou Ze sat down beside her.\n\nThe female corpse tactfully did not approach.\n\nThe two of them sat next to each other.\n\nLin Wanqiu took a deep breath. Her pretty face looked even more exquisite in the moonlight.\n\nZhou Ze admired her from the side.\n\nTo have such a beautiful woman, and such a good-looking... wife,\n\nstill thinking about him, who had been dead for more than half a year...\n\nThe sense of accomplishment was truly bursting.\n\n\"About what just happened, is it really okay?\" Dr. Lin clearly hadn't fully detached from the incident yet.\n\n\"We didn't do anything wrong, right?\" Zhou Ze comforted her.\n\nDr. Lin nodded.\n\n\"It's like those brave anti-drug police officers. They also have to hide their identities, and so do their families. It's to ensure their safety. It's a great sacrifice they make.\"\n\n\"So, you're afraid of retaliation?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand.\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, preparing to pull the woman into an embrace, and then it would be \"time to witness the miracle.\" But Dr. Lin spoke first:\n\n\"What exactly is the relationship between you and her?\n\nXu Le, please answer me seriously. This time, no matter what you answer, I'll believe you.\" Dr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze and asked, \"And I'll forgive you, too.\"\n\n\"There's really nothing between us,\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile. All he could say was that both times had been too coincidental.\n\nDr. Lin fell silent again. Just as Zhou Ze was about to speak, Dr. Lin took the initiative and grasped his hand. Zhou Ze was stunned for a moment.\n\n\"Xu Le, I'm sorry. I've always been in love with another man. You must have already discovered it, otherwise you wouldn't have appeared at that house.\n\nAlthough nothing happened between me and that man, I admit that I cheated on you emotionally. I'm sorry, because you're the one who is my husband in name.\"\n\n\"It's o—\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to speak, Dr. Lin spoke again:\n\n\"About us, I've thought it through.\n\nI'll give you two choices.\n\nOne, we get a divorce. I'll compensate you with one million yuan myself. The bookstore will also be yours.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, divorce?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Two, I will try my best to forget that man. I will choose to live a down-to-earth life with you, to be your... real wife, to make up for how I've wronged you in the past.\n\nXu Le, I'm willing to try, to give you my all, and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of a wife.\"\n\nAs she said these words, Dr. Lin's eyes reddened. She had resigned herself to her fate.\n\n\"Okay... hey, wait a minute.\"\n\nZhou Ze's brain couldn't quite process it for a moment. The relationship was a bit messy; he needed to sort it out first. Then, Zhou Ze finally understood the details, and he was so angry that he immediately stood up, pointed at Dr. Lin, and blurted out without thinking:\n\n\"No!\n\nYou have to keep cheating on me!\"\n\n\"...\" Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Pfft...\" In the distance, the female corpse, who had been pretending to look at the scenery but was actually eavesdropping on the gossip with her superhuman hearing, burst out laughing.\n\nThen she clutched her stomach and squatted down.\n\n\"Hahahaha, I'm laughing so hard my tummy hurts!\"\n\n---\n*Author's Note*\n\nDragon is very happy to see everyone's active presence in the chapter bullet comments. This signifies a book's popularity.

    "content": "\"No, you have to keep cheating!\"\n\n\"...\" Doctor Lin.\n\nDoctor Lin's red lips parted slightly. She was at a loss, and a little baffled.\n\nHad her \"husband\" not forgiven her yet?\n\nOr maybe, her \"husband\" himself had some kind of cuckolding fetish?\n\nUnder the weight of guilt and pressure, Doctor Lin had chosen to compromise. In truth, between the two conditions she'd offered, anyone who wasn't a fool or incredibly naive would certainly choose the second.\n\nThe first was to take a million yuan plus a bookstore operating at a loss.\n\nThe second was to get her and her money together. Once you had her, would a million yuan even be an issue?\n\nBesides, she wasn't some ugly, rich old woman.\n\nHowever, for Zhou Ze, the situation he faced was a bit more difficult.\n\n*I've been working my ass off for half the day, and now you're telling me you're going to forget me and get ready to resign yourself to a peaceful life with that little bastard Xu Le?*\n\nZhou Ze could not allow this to happen.\n\nOriginally, he was the one cuckolding someone else, and it felt great.\n\nHis sense of accomplishment was shooting up, *biu biu biu*.\n\nNow that he was the one being cuckolded, it wasn't quite so wonderful.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, pointed to his own face, and said very seriously, \"I'm not Xu Le. I'm Zhou Ze.\"\n\nDoctor Lin froze.\n\nThe two of them were silent for a long while.\n\nFinally, Doctor Lin sighed and said, \"No matter which option you choose, I admit I've wronged you. But you shouldn't tease me like this. Or... is there still resentment in your heart, is that it?\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged. \"I really am Zhou Ze. I died in a car crash, but when I woke up, I'd inexplicably crossed over into this guy's body. I don't know if you read novels or watch TV shows, but this kind of transmigration plot shouldn't be all that rare.\"\n\n\"Whatever... you say,\" Doctor Lin said, humoring him.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that the woman before him was probably planning to contact a psychiatrist for him tomorrow. If she were more extreme, she might even have him forcibly committed to a mental hospital.\n\nIn the distance, the sound of a 120 ambulance siren wailed, and the hospital building suddenly burst into a commotion.\n\n\"I'll go take a look.\" Doctor Lin stood up, intending to temporarily abandon the conversation with her \"husband.\" In her eyes, her \"husband\" had suffered a considerable mental shock.\n\nBut because of this, she felt even more guilt toward Xu Le.\n\nAfter seeing Lin Wanqiu leave, the female corpse, who had been eavesdropping on the gossip the whole time, came up behind Zhou Ze and said, \"Boss, why don't you let her see your gray nail?\"\n\n\"Or let her see if I'm cold?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nThe female corpse pouted and said, \"I suppose that could work. If she stuck her hand in to feel, she'd understand.\"\n\n\"I want it to be a bit more poetic,\" Zhou Ze said. \"As gentle as possible.\"\n\n\"How melodramatic.\" The female corpse took the opportunity to boldly mock her boss.\n\n\"Yeah, melodramatic. You were a lady from a good family having secret trysts with a brooding scholar. Wasn't that melodramatic too?\" Zhou Ze stretched. \"Come on, follow me inside.\"\n\n\"To the hospital?\"\n\n\"Duh. With such a huge commotion over there, it must be a major accident. There are bound to be a lot of injured people, and the attending emergency physicians will definitely be short-staffed. Those interns don't have enough experience or guts to handle this kind of situation.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze walked into the hospital with the female corpse, then turned directly into the staff changing room.\n\n\"But Boss, what does this have to do with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze picked out a white coat that was about his size and put it on, then fastened a surgical mask.\n\n\"I was a doctor in my past life. Doctor Lin was an intern I supervised back then.\"\n\n\"Heh heh, a student-teacher romance.\" The female corpse also changed into a white coat and said with a hint of excitement, \"So Boss, what do I do?\"\n\n\"Pick some BGM for me,\" Zhou Ze said, pulling on his gloves.\n\n\"BGM?\" The female corpse was taken aback.\n\n\"Because I'm about to show off.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\n*This familiar feeling...*\n\n*I'm back.*\n\n...\n\n\"The doctors now are so different from the doctors in my time,\" the female corpse said, feeling a bit awkward in her nurse's dress.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze replied noncommittally.\n\n\"It's made me a bit disoriented,\" the female corpse lamented. \"I feel like I'm a bit out of touch with this world. Looks like I'll have to go out more in the future,\" she said tentatively.\n\n\"Cut the crap. You even know what Wan Chai Pier is,¹ and you have the gall to say you're out of touch?\" Zhou Ze quickly shot back.\n\nThe female corpse stuck out her tongue. \"Boss, what kind of doctor were you before? I hear being an OB/GYN is pretty good.\"\n\n\"You read novels in your coffin too?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"What?\" The female corpse was confused.\n\n\"Golden ophthalmology, silver surgery, and the dirty, exhausting work is in OB/GYN.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Only outsiders or people influenced by certain literary works would think being an OB/GYN is wonderful and pleasant.\"\n\nJust then, the elevator opened, and a gurney was pushed over by several orderlies.\n\nZhou Ze immediately walked over and asked, \"What's going on?\"\n\nThe intern instinctively answered as if speaking to his \"mentor,\" \"Patient has lost consciousness.\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened. He immediately climbed onto the gurney, straddling the patient to begin CPR compressions while shouting, \"Quick, to the resuscitation room!\"\n\nAt that moment, several orderlies and nurses pushed the gurney forward together. The many patients and family members in the hallway had to hastily make way.\n\n\"Clear the way ahead!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nDoctor Lin, having just finished treating an injured person's wound, wiped the sweat from her forehead and walked out. She saw the figure kneeling on the gurney performing CPR and froze for a second.\n\nThen she immediately ran over.\n\n*What on earth is he doing?*\n\n*This is a hospital!*\n\nUpon reaching the resuscitation room, Zhou Ze directly ordered, \"Bring the crash cart, prepare for tracheal intubation!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The intern responded. Seeing the intern comply, the surrounding nurses naturally followed the commands as well.\n\nThey each assumed that the others knew this new doctor. In reality, this was the biggest misunderstanding of all. Of course, it was also because the situation was urgent, and Zhou Ze's tone and commands truly didn't sound like those of a \"fake doctor.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood at the head of the bed, performing the intubation himself.\n\nAt the same time, he held his hand out to his left. \"Stylet.\"\n\n\"Here.\" A female nurse immediately passed the item into Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nZhou Ze then said to the intern beside him, \"Check placement.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The intern, who had been a bit nervous before, was no longer tense. Many young doctors are like this: they have solid skills but are not suited for taking the lead, functioning better as foot soldiers under someone else's command.\n\nHe put on his stethoscope, listened for placement, then nodded at Zhou Ze. \"Placement is good.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Switch out, continue compressions.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nAnother nurse at the side immediately came over to take the place of the previous one and continue CPR.\n\nJust then, a nurse looked at the monitor beside them and cried out in alarm, \"Patient's in v-fib.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up. \"Prepare to defibrillate.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nThe intern immediately grabbed scissors and cut open the patient's clothes. Zhou Ze took over from the previous nurse and began performing CPR himself, simultaneously saying, \"Charge to two hundred joules.\"\n\n\"Understood,\" the female nurse replied, getting everything ready. Then she announced, \"Charged.\"\n\nAt that moment, Doctor Lin pushed aside the curtain and walked in, her eyes locking onto the figure organizing the rescue.\n\nThat was right, it was Xu Le. It was her husband.\n\nDoctor Lin pointed a finger at Zhou Ze. She was furious. She didn't know what was wrong with her husband. He had just told her he was Zhou Ze, and she thought he might be suffering from hysteria, but she would absolutely not allow him to joke around with a patient's life!\n\n\"Preparing to discharge. Clear!\" Zhou Ze warned everyone around him, then fixed his gaze pointedly on Doctor Lin.\n\nDoctor Lin's body trembled. A familiar feeling washed over her entire body.\n\nThe familiar scene,\n\nthe familiar tone of voice,\n\nthe familiar style.\n\nAt that moment, she couldn't even speak.\n\nAfter the first defibrillation, Zhou Ze continued CPR, his eyes fixed on the monitor.\n\nBut the situation didn't improve. Zhou Ze said directly, \"Again! Charge to two hundred joules!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The female nurse prepared again, then said, \"Charged.\"\n\n\"Clear.\"\n\nZhou Ze administered the defibrillation once more.\n\nUnder the electric shock, the patient's whole body convulsed.\n\nThe intern beside him continued with CPR.\n\nZhou Ze watched the monitor, which finally showed a return to a normal rhythm.\n\n\"Rhythm restored. Run an EKG,\" Zhou Ze said to the intern.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe intern immediately went to prepare it, then handed the EKG report to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took it, glanced at it, and said, \"Acute myocardial infarction. Contact Cardiology, prepare for an emergency PCI immediately.\"\n\n\"Okay, understood.\" The intern wiped his sweat, letting out a long sigh of relief.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze also walked out of the resuscitation room.\n\nDoctor Lin was standing right outside. The look in her eyes as she stared at him was filled with suspicion, with disbelief, with excitement, and at the same time, with fear.\n\nZhou Ze directly berated her:\n\n\"What are you standing there frozen for? There are so many patients. Go save them!\n\n\"If you want to cry, if you want to be scared, wait until you're off work, go home, and cry into a doll in bed.\"\n\nDoctor Lin immediately burst into tears.\n\nBack then, he...\n\nhad scolded her just like this.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nDoctor Lin rushed forward, wrapped her arms around Zhou Ze, and pressed her face directly against his chest.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nHe had anticipated many of Doctor Lin's possible reactions after his confession.\n\nFear?\n\nA breakdown?\n\nTerror?\n\nBut he had never, ever expected this scene.\n\n*Holy shit.*\n\n*She's throwing herself into my arms already?*\n\n*This is all it took?*\n\nZhou Ze had always been curious how he, a man who had been so blunt and unromantic, had managed to capture the heart of Doctor Lin, who was just a naive young girl back then.\n\nNow, he thought he understood a little.\n\n*Could Doctor Lin have Stockholm Syndrome?*\n\n*She got lectured and scolded, and she ended up falling for me?*\n\n*But, it seems women with this syndrome might also be receptive to certain... proclivities... in bed that normal people would find hard to accept?*\n\n*Heh heh.*\n\n---\n¹ Wan Chai Pier is a popular brand of frozen dumplings in China.",

    "content": "The evening sun was like a bright red apple, or like a little sister's face, roasted ruddy.\n\n  Zhou Ze sat in the bookstore, sorting through the latest batch of bills. The bookstore's operations had become tight. The key problem was that the inheritance he received from Xu Le was simply too small.\n\n  If he hadn't managed to get back his share from those pirated booksellers, the shop probably wouldn't have been able to stay afloat.\n\n  That night after returning from the hospital, Zhou Ze had burned all the remaining spirit money. He even squatted by the door, smoking half a pack of cigarettes and waiting for a while. Sure enough, no one came to throw money at him anymore.\n\n  According to the female corpse, this was a case of using nether-virtue to ward off calamity.\n\n  The spirit money given by ghosts was equivalent to nether-virtue. When you needed money, you could \"exchange\" it for cash. When you needed refuge, you could use it to offset trouble.\n\n  The last incident was reported in the news: a rich man had hired someone to kill his wife.\n\n  A rumor claimed the suspect had said a high school girl showed up and beat them up. Of course, no one believed that.\n\n  It's not like she was a Sailor Scout.\n\n  In any case, the matter was closed, and Zhou Ze's spirit money hadn't been burned in vain.\n\n  Xu Qinglang came over from next door, holding two cups of tea. His lifestyle was getting more and more refined.\n\n  Originally a diligent and promising young man,\n\n  after coming into possession of over twenty properties,\n\n  he had finally begun to indulge in pleasure, stepping onto the path of degeneracy.\n\n  The two of them sat by the counter, drinking tea together.\n\n  \"That wife of yours, what happened in the end?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n  \"She said she needs some time to be quiet and to think,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  The confession process had been very smooth,\n\n  so smooth, in fact, it was almost unnerving.\n\n  Dr. Lin's affection for him was even showing a tendency to become \"pathological,\" but thankfully, she was still a rational person.\n\n  Xu Le was dead, and he, Zhou Ze, had been reincarnated in his body. With all these incredible things happening right in front of her, asking her to accept it all at once and continue a blissful, shameless life with her \"dream lover\" slash \"current husband\"...\n\n  was a bit difficult.\n\n  \"That's already pretty good. She's stronger than I imagined.\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"A normal person would have probably been scared out of their mind.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze was noncommittal.\n\n  Xu Qinglang shouldn't have known about this. Clearly, someone had leaked it.\n\n  He didn't need to search to know who the leaker was.\n\n  That Ms. Bai Yingying.\n\n  \"Right, let me ask you something,\" Zhou Ze said very seriously. \"When Xu Le was running the shop, was he this hard up?\"\n\n  \"Nope, I thought he was living quite freely. But I didn't have much to do with him before he died. He was a very dull guy, super uninteresting.\n\n  But he should have had a lot of money. I remember back then he was often helping out his relatives in the bookstore, and he was very generous.\"\n\n  After speaking, Xu Qinglang glanced at Zhou Ze again, even sticking out his tongue to lick his lips.\n\n  \"You're much more interesting.\"\n\n  For a moment, with his swaying waist and bewitching eyes, he was truly captivating.\n\n  \"It's a real shame you didn't become a gigolo. You could have been the king of them all.\"¹\n\n  \"Can we have a normal conversation or not?\" Xu Qinglang said angrily.\n\n  \"That was a compliment.\"\n\n  \"Hah...\" Xu Qinglang pointed a finger at Zhou Ze. \"You should be more concerned about yourself.\"\n\n  \"Concerned about what?\" Zhou Ze gestured at the bookstore. \"Business has been slow lately. It's bad enough that I barely see any living people, but I haven't even seen many ghosts.\"\n\n  \"You and that doctor wife of yours, how are you planning to move forward? I think she just needs some time to process, and then she'll accept it.\n\n  After all, a woman like that... honestly, you lucked out. Who knew that in this day and age, you could still find a woman like a proper lady from a bygone era? Her parents must be quite the characters too.\"\n\n  \"Yeah.\" Zhou Ze nodded. His father-in-law and mother-in-law were indeed quite the characters.\n\n  His father-in-law had been a hospital director and had also run his own medical company. Logically, he should be an absolute man of success, but in certain aspects, he appeared very feudal and stubborn.\n\n  \"A woman like that, once you've tamed her, she'll willingly dedicate herself to being a devoted wife and mother,\"² Xu Qinglang said, a look of longing on his face. \"I want a woman like that too.\"\n\n  \"You already are one,\" Zhou Ze added, twisting the knife.\n\n  \"Let's talk about your problem. You're going to live with her in the future, right?\"\n\n  \"I suppose so,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n  \"Then you'll definitely be sleeping together, right?\" Xu Qinglang held out a hand, shaking it slightly. \"When I say 'sleep,' I'm referring to a verb that encompasses many complex actions and special positions. You get what I mean, right?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze nodded, though he still didn't know what Xu Qinglang was getting at.\n\n  \"Alright, then, here's your problem. You're using Xu Le's body now. If you two really do sleep together, doesn't that also mean Xu Le cuckolded you?\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang narrowed his eyes, a mischievous grin on his face.\n\n  And then,\n\n  Zhou Ze fell into deep thought.\n\n  \"Furthermore, your DNA isn't your original DNA; it's Xu Le's. Which means, after you go through the extremely complex and rich process of the verb 'to sleep,' the child that's born...\n\n  isn't actually your child. It's Xu Le and Lin Wanqiu's child.\n\n  Right?\"\n\n  And then,\n\n  Zhou Ze once again fell into deep thought.\n\n  The more Xu Qinglang spoke, the more excited he got. Seeing Zhou Ze's continued silence, he felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction!\n\n  Back when Madam Bai sent her men with an eight-bearer sedan chair to pick him up,\n\n  it was Zhou Ze who had secretly pointed a finger at him.\n\n  He had noted that grudge down in his little black book!\n\n  Zhou Ze took a sip of water, his expression unchanged.\n\n  \"Feeling worried and lost?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n  \"I'm the one who gets the pleasure,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  Xu Qinglang frowned and continued, \"But the body is Xu Le's. When you sleep with her, it's Xu Le's body.\"\n\n  \"I'm the one who gets the pleasure.\"\n\n  \"But the child's DNA...\"\n\n  \"I'm the one who gets the pleasure.\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang slammed both hands on the counter and scolded:\n\n  \"Damn it, you can't be this nonchalant about it!\"\n\n  \"Whatever, I'm the one who gets the pleasure. That Xu Le guy went to Hell ages ago, who knows where he is now. He's probably already drunk Granny Meng's soup³ and been reincarnated. Why should I care about this?\n\n  As long as I'm getting mine, that's all that matters.\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang's chest heaved with anger. He didn't know why he was so mad,\n\n  but he just was!\n\n  \"Alright, let's drop it. If we keep going, this will turn into a debate on spirit versus flesh. We're almost reaching a philosophical level,\" Zhou Ze said, signaling an end to the somewhat tedious discussion.\n\n  \"Whatever makes you happy,\" Xu Qinglang said, full of resentment.\n\n  \"Right, there's something I need to ask you,\" Zhou Ze said, thinking of something else.\n\n  \"Spit it out.\"\n\n  \"Do you know any other Underworld Emissaries?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"I was living with the spirits of my parents. Do you think I'd dare to go around meeting Underworld Emissaries?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n  \"Alright, I get it.\"\n\n  Looks like he'd have to find time to visit the Confucian Temple. The short old man he saw last time, the one beating the gong, should also be on the official payroll.\n\n  \"What did you want to ask, anyway?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n  \"I wanted to ask if Underworld Emissaries have things like performance reviews, promotions, raises, and benefits.\"\n\n  \"There should be... I think,\" Xu Qinglang mused for a moment. \"Look at Madam Bai. She was able to accumulate merit and go from a lingering ghost in the mortal world back to Hell to seek an official position. You should have something similar.\n\n  Didn't that little loli tell you?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\n  \"I always thought you became an Underworld Emissary a bit too easily. My guess is, she probably had something else, something serious, to deal with, so she just tossed the job to you to handle for the time being.\"\n\n  \"So you're saying I'm just a temp?\"\n\n  \"Heh, once she's done with her business, you'll probably have to clear out. If she's in a good mood, she might turn a blind eye. If she's not, it's entirely possible she'll drag you back to Hell.\"\n\n  \"What business could she possibly have to deal with?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\n  Immediately, the image of the young man sipping congee from the old Taoist's livestream appeared in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\n  Rongcheng,\n\n  a netherworld shop?\n\n  Thinking back on the little loli's reaction when he mentioned Rongcheng,\n\n  it seemed,\n\n  it was actually possible.\n\n  But no matter what, he couldn't just easily give back his temp status. The life of an unregistered soul was not a comfortable one.\n\n  Xu Qinglang went back to his own shop, wishing Zhou Ze a \"Happy Lantern Festival\" as he left.\n\n  Zhou Ze was also packing up, simultaneously telling Bai Yingying to go out and buy him a few cartons of cigarettes and some sweet rice balls. He had to change his plans; tonight, he would go to the Confucian Temple to chat with that short old man.\n\n  Just then, the bookstore door was pushed open, and a man in a white down jacket walked in.\n\n  \"Brother Le! I came to pick up my dad from the hospital.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze froze for a second, his mind racing. He roughly guessed the man's identity. He must be his eldest uncle's son, a bit younger than him, making him Xu Le's cousin.\n\n  Xu Dachuan had come to the city to see him last time and had gotten into a car accident on his way out, suffering a minor fracture. Zhou Ze had visited him once afterward. Dr. Lin had paid for all the medical expenses, so he hadn't concerned himself with it further.\n\n  \"Hello,\" Zhou Ze responded, somewhat coldly.\n\n  \"Brother Le, I'm a little short on spending money lately. You see, with my dad's fall, he'll have to rest at home for at least two months. He won't be able to go out and work for money.\"\n\n  The cousin smiled at Zhou Ze.\n\n  \"I already gave uncle money for nutrition.\" Zhou Ze had given him some. Xu Dachuan hadn't wanted to take it, so Zhou Ze had secretly stuffed it into his clothes.\n\n  \"Hey, Brother Le, I just got a new girlfriend, and my wallet's a bit tight. Bro, help your little brother out, huh?\" The cousin was now asking directly.\n\n  \"Business isn't good here,\" Zhou Ze said, not planning to give him anything.\n\n  \"Bro, that's not cool of you.\" The cousin was unhappy now. \"I was the one who found someone to help you with that thing last time.\"\n\n  \"What thing?\"\n\n  \"Bro, that's low, acting like you don't know after the job is done? Let me tell you, I'm not shamelessly asking you for money. Look, have I come to you for money at all in the last six months?\n\n  About that thing last time, the driver promised he wouldn't let it slip. Besides, he's been locked up for half a year already, and he'll be out in another six months or so. He'd have to be an idiot to spill the beans, right? He'll keep his mouth shut, otherwise it goes from reckless driving to intentional murder.\n\n  Little bro is really tight on cash this time. Bro, just spot me one or two thousand. I'll pay you back when I have money, okay?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze picked up the teacup on the counter. Hearing this, his brow furrowed slightly.\n\n  \"What exactly are you talking about? I don't understand.\"\n\n  \"Bro, are you planning to tear down the bridge after crossing it?\n\n  Six months ago, you were the one who had me contact a truck driver and pay him to deliberately run over and kill that doctor.\n\n  You can't forget my contribution...\"\n\n  *Crack...*\n\n  The glass in Zhou Ze's hand,\n\n  was crushed to pieces.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **King of them all**: Original term is \"一代鴨王\" (yīdài yāwáng), literally \"Duck King of a Generation.\" \"Duck\" (鴨) is slang for a male prostitute or gigolo.\n2.  **Devoted wife and mother**: Original term is \"相夫教子\" (xiàngfū-jiàozǐ), a traditional ideal for women, meaning \"to assist one's husband and educate one's children.\"\n3.  **Granny Meng's soup**: In Chinese mythology, this is a soup given to souls before reincarnation to make them forget their past lives.",

    "content": "\"Brother Le?\" The cousin watched as Zhou Ze simply crushed the glass in his hand, watched as blood dripped ceaselessly from Zhou Ze's palm. He was so frightened that he instinctively took several steps back.\n\n\"Brother Le, if you're tight on cash, just forget it, really, just forget it.\" The cousin was clearly scared, his voice tinged with a sob as he spoke.\n\nThey were grasshoppers tied to the same rope; it wasn't a matter of who was threatening whom. Of course, his initial plan had just been to use this favor to squeeze a bit more spending money out of him.\n\nBut if he pushed his cousin too far...\n\nYes, his cousin was the mastermind, but what about him?\n\nHe was also a participant, even acting as the middleman. His crime was not necessarily lighter than his cousin's. As for that truck driver, he was practically the hitman.\n\nSo, he didn't dare push his cousin too hard. He was afraid too.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood why, after he had borrowed Xu Le's body, Xu Le had so little money. The bookstore's losses were one thing, but the other reason was that Xu Le had spent most of his money on that matter.\n\nIt was absurd.\n\nIt was laughable.\n\nIn the end,\n\nthe cause of his own death was a result like this.\n\nHe slumped back into his chair. Zhou Ze looked at the glass shards embedded in his palm, at the fresh blood dripping continuously.\n\nHe didn't try to stop the bleeding, nor did he feel much pain.\n\nIn fact, he found it quite interesting.\n\nEven the most brilliant black comedy couldn't have scripted the irony he was feeling right now, could it?\n\nThat man he had always considered weak,\n\nspineless,\n\npathetic,\n\na man so lowly that even he found him a little pitiful,\n\nwas actually the mastermind who hired someone to kill him!\n\nEverything, after all the twists and turns, seemed to have come full circle.\n\nYes,\n\nyou could call it the unfailing retribution of karma!\n\nYes,\n\nyou could interpret it as fate decreed by cause and effect!\n\nYes,\n\nyou could cheer that heaven has eyes, that what goes around, comes around!¹\n\nBut these are all the perspectives of bystanders. Bystanders expect to see a story of evil conclude with the villain punished and the good guy compensated.\n\nThis gives the bystanders a sense of security, makes them feel that all is right with the world.\n\nIt puts them in a good mood so they can eat a couple more mouthfuls of rice at dinner.\n\nHowever,\n\nwho could pay for his original life?\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head slightly, his body beginning to tremble.\n\nAn intense rage started to flood his entire being.\n\nDr. Zhou,\n\nDirector Zhou,\n\nhe had walked out of an orphanage, every step thorny, every step difficult!\n\nHe had no connections, no background, and had clawed his way up the hospital system purely through his own effort and skill, all while adhering to his medical ethics and principles, hoping to achieve greater success and a higher position.\n\nHe had been cautious and meticulous, as if walking on thin ice!\n\nHe had finally, with great difficulty, climbed to that position at that age.\n\nHe had finally, with great difficulty, made a name for himself in his field through his medical skills.\n\nHow much sweat had he shed?\n\nThe countless times he had motivated and encouraged himself while lying in bed late at night.\n\nAnd how many times had he gritted his teeth and swallowed the humiliation!\n\nGone.\n\nIt was all gone!\n\nAll because of this bastard, this piece of trash.\n\nHe discovered his wife's secret crush on him,\n\nhis own wife wouldn't sleep with him,\n\nhe felt wronged,\n\nhe felt enraged,\n\nhe felt indignant!\n\nHe wouldn't reflect on why he had thrown away all his dignity to become a son-in-law who marries into the family.²\n\nHe wouldn't reflect on why he was looked down upon everywhere.\n\nHe wouldn't reflect on himself,\n\nnor would he examine his own actions.\n\nHe aimed the outlet for his anger right at him!\n\nIf he had actually had some sort of affair with his wife, that would have been one thing.\n\nBut at that time, he had long forgotten about the cute little intern he had supervised years ago!\n\nHe knew absolutely nothing.\n\nBut on his way home from work, at a traffic light, while he was carrying a cake and gifts to celebrate Children's Day with the kids at the orphanage,\n\nthat truck driver, who had taken the money,\n\njust stepped on the gas,\n\nand directly smashed to pieces the life he had fought so hard to build!\n\n\"Brother Le, uh, I'll get going now. You take care of yourself.\"\n\nThe cousin didn't dare to linger any longer. He turned, pushed open the bookstore's glass door, and left. He still had to pick up his father from the hospital, and given Zhou Ze's current state, he was genuinely afraid of provoking his cousin—a man with a touch of the artsy-fartsy, usually gentle and weak, but who, when pushed, was terrifying even to him!\n\n\"I'm going to kill that guy, kill him! With the money I got from her, I'm going to kill him, ahhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nTo this day, the cousin still remembered his cousin's twisted face on that evening six months ago when he'd slammed several stacks of cash in front of him and said those words.\n\nThis cousin, whom he had secretly laughed at, whom he thought was spineless, cowardly, even willing to become a live-in son-in-law who stooped to social climbing, whose children couldn't even take his own surname,\n\nat that dusk,\n\nhad completely changed his image in his mind.\n\nWatching his cousin's retreating back, Zhou Ze's bleeding palm's fingernails grew out and receded, again and again.\n\nWisps of black qi swirled ceaselessly around his fingertips.\n\nA violent glint, a mix of blood-red and black, flickered and intertwined in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThis was his enemy,\n\none of the masterminds behind his own murder.\n\nHe wanted to keep this person here forever.\n\nHe wanted Bai Yingying to use this person as food, to suck him dry of all his blood until he became a human husk!\n\nBut he just walked away,\n\nand Zhou Ze, from beginning to end,\n\nnever made a move.\n\nHe didn't even stand up and shout \"Stop.\"\n\nRationality,\n\nthis damned rationality,\n\nthis despairing, sanity-shattering rationality!\n\nZhou Ze knew he couldn't kill him.\n\nEven if he were to ignore his status as a netherworld official and the other consequences that would arise from avenging himself,\n\njust consider this: if he killed him,\n\nwhat would the driver in prison think when he heard the news?\n\nWouldn't he think Zhou Ze was silencing a witness?\n\nIn that case, would he have to go and kill the driver as well?\n\nThat's right, the driver was the primary killer in his murder!\n\nIt was that damned bastard who, on that night, had kept his eyes on him and then run a red light to deliberately crash into him!\n\nThe cousin deserved to die,\n\nand that driver deserved to die even more!\n\nBut if he killed both of them, no matter how he tried to hide it or stage some sort of accident,\n\nthe police would definitely find something amiss.\n\nAnd then, the connection would become clear!\n\nIn fact,\n\nthe most critical part of the matter was that the person who had actually paid for the murder-for-hire was the current Zhou Ze!\n\nHe was the true mastermind!\n\nIf he were to take revenge, killing them would be equivalent to exposing himself.\n\nThey had already ruined his first life.\n\nCould it be that,\n\nbecause of them, he had to ruin the chance at a new life he had obtained with such difficulty?\n\nRuin his,\n\ncurrent, second life?\n\nZhou Ze clenched both fists and slammed them heavily onto the counter.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe world spun around him.\n\nZhou Ze staggered, taking several steps back. His back hit the corner of the wall, and he slowly slid down to the floor.\n\nHis blood-soaked hand covered his eyes,\n\nwhile his other hand unconsciously scraped against the tile floor.\n\nYou're furious,\n\nbut you have no way to vent it.\n\nThis,\n\nfucking life!\n\nThis son-of-a-bitch heavenly justice,\n\nthis absolute bastard of a karmic cycle!\n\nIn my last life, I saved a lot of people, and I helped a lot of people!!!\n\nTears trickled from the corners of Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nEveryone has their moments of weakness; the only thing to do is cover one's weeping eyes with one's palm.\n\nEveryone also has moments where they resent the heavens and bemoan the unfairness of the world; not everyone is a pure robot, always able to calmly analyze themselves when faced with adversity.\n\nIn his past life, Zhou Ze believed he had never done anything to trouble his conscience. He had saved the lives of many patients, salvaged the lives and families of many people.\n\nHe didn't let things slide, nor did he go with the flow. Even with a strong, utilitarian desire to climb higher, he still abided by his duties as a person and a doctor. Because of this, the difficulty he faced and the effort required for his ascent were greater than for others who were willing to bow their heads!\n\nIn a corner of the counter, a piece of hell money lay there,\n\nprobably one left over from the bills he had burned that night.\n\nJust as Bai Yingying had said, spirit money given by the dead was equivalent to Yin Virtue.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nperhaps because heaven saw that he had accumulated too much virtue in his past life, it decided to compensate him in this one.\n\nLetting him be \"reborn,\" giving him a beautiful wife right away, letting him own a bookstore, and even, to display its brilliance as an \"incorruptible judge,\"\n\nit let him, as he emerged from hell, his soul wavering on the verge of collapse by the roadside,\n\nrun into Xu Le, who had been accidentally killed by a petty thief.\n\nLetting him inherit Xu Le's life.\n\nMaking this man, who had originally masterminded his murder, pay what heaven considered a just price.\n\nBut... who had asked him, Zhou Ze, if he agreed?\n\nTo the point that,\n\nnow,\n\nhe couldn't even take revenge!\n\nWhen that bastard walked up to him and talked about hiring a hitman to run over that doctor,\n\nhe could only sit there, dejected,\n\nmotionless!\n\nThe last rays of the setting sun,\n\nspilled into the doorway of the bookstore,\n\ntaking with them today's,\n\nlast lingering trace of warmth.\n\n\"Oh, right, I just developed a new strawberry juice recipe. Want to have a taste so I can make some improvements?\" Xu Qinglang pushed open the door and walked in, carrying a wine glass.\n\nWhen he saw Zhou Ze sitting in the corner, his hand dripping with blood, he froze for a moment. He immediately put down the strawberry juice and ran over, crouching down beside Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Why... this isn't fair... No... this damned fairness,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nXu Qinglang fell silent. He didn't know what had happened to make Zhou Ze this way. The Zhou Ze he knew had always seemed so rational, so calm and detached.\n\nHe was even someone who, amidst his seriousness and rigidity, would occasionally crack a joke. This was a very self-disciplined person, but self-disciplined people are often the most helpless when they finally break down under a blow.\n\nThe Zhou Ze at this moment reminded Xu Qinglang of himself on the day the little loli took his parents' souls away in the shop.\n\nHe had complained about the unfairness,\n\nbecause Zhou Ze next door was also a ghost,\n\nbut the little loli had let him be, turning instead to take away his parents' souls.\n\nXu Qinglang sighed.\n\nHe reached out and put an arm around Zhou Ze's shoulders, letting Zhou Ze's forehead rest against his chest, and chimed in with agreement:\n\n\"Brother, I don't know what happened, but I can totally empathize with what you're feeling right now.\n\nEven the most badass Chopin couldn't play our sorrow.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"What goes around, comes around!\"**: The original phrase, 出來混的，總是要還的 (chūlái hùn de, zǒng shì yào huán de), is a common saying in gangster/underworld contexts, literally meaning \"those who are out mixing in the world will always have to pay it back.\"\n2.  **\"A son-in-law who marries into the family\"**: The original term, 上門女婿 (shàngmén nǚxù) or 倒插門 (dàochāmén), refers to a man who marries into his wife's family, often living with them. This traditionally carried a social stigma, implying the man was of lower status or was marrying for financial reasons, as it reverses patriarchal norms.",

    "content": "Three cartons of cigarettes in her left hand, a bag of glutinous rice balls in her right, and a stylish new crossbody bag slung over her shoulder.\n\nBai Yingying wouldn't waste any opportunity Zhou Ze gave her to leave the bookstore. Heaven knows how she managed to buy a crossbody bag so quickly after getting the cigarettes and glutinous rice balls!\n\nPushing open the bookstore door,\n\nBai Yingying saw a scene of two men embracing. She immediately dropped her things and covered her eyes,\n\nwhile simultaneously peeking hard through the gaps between her fingers.\n\nNot forgetting to stomp her foot, she said coyly,\n\n\"Eee, eee, eee...\n\nDid I come back at a bad time?\"\n\nThe Honorable Lady Xu—¹\n\nOh, no,\n\nXu Qinglang glared back at Bai Yingying, a look of such aggrieved charm it threatened to condense and drip out like summer dew.\n\nSuch a torrential aura of a slighted maiden's resentment,\n\nHow terrifying!\n\nIt made Bai Yingying wonder if she was the jiangshi, or if this noodle shop owner was.\n\n\"Are the things bought?\" Zhou Ze asked, standing up.\n\nHe straightened his clothes.\n\nXu Qinglang also stood up and pretended to button his shirt.\n\n\"Boss, I bought everything,\" Bai Yingying answered乖巧地.\n\n\"Good, I'm heading out for a bit.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over, picked up the cigarettes and glutinous rice balls, and said to Bai Yingying, \"You watch the house.\"\n\n\"You got it.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze left the store, Bai Yingying and Xu Qinglang glared at each other, cross-eyed.\n\n\"What are you looking at, corpse,\" Xu Qinglang said irritably.\n\n\"If you went back to hiding in the cabinet, I wouldn't be able to see you,\" Bai Yingying retorted sarcastically.\n\n\"You're an ice-sicle, an ice-sicle! The kind of ice that freezes into a popsicle!\"\n\nXu Qinglang continued his counter-attack!\n\n\"Hah. Your waterway's blocked.\n\nIf you take the dry road, you're liable to run into bandits and have a bloody disaster.\"²\n\nBai Yingying's rebuttal was sharp.\n\n\"Hmph!\"\n\n\"Hmph!\"\n\nThe two parted on bad terms. Xu Qinglang returned to his noodle shop, while Bai Yingying, mimicking Zhou Ze, sat down in the boss's chair behind the counter, poured a cup of hot water, and picked up a book, pretending to read with great atmosphere.\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze planned to make a trip to the Confucian Temple. No matter how much sorrow life throws at you, you first have to endure it, then go on living as you must.\n\nIt was like the last night of a short vacation; the thought of having to wake up early for work the next day was despair-inducing.\n\nYou want to just give up, but you still have no choice but to set your alarm.\n\nThis is life. For successful people, others are always fascinated by the secrets to their success, envious of their current glory.\n\nIt's like when a woman has just had a baby; friends and relatives all come to congratulate her, but no one cares how many times she had to get fucked to conceive that baby in the first place.\n\nThe words are crude, but the principle isn't, right?\n\nZhou Ze could only console himself.\n\nAs for that so-called younger cousin and that truck driver, how to respond to them was a matter for careful consideration. At the very least, Zhou Ze was not such a magnanimous person.\n\nHe couldn't pull off the same arrogant dominance as that colleague from Rongcheng, but since this matter involved his own \"murder case,\" it certainly couldn't be brushed aside lightly.\n\nHe took out his phone, preparing to call a car, but happened to see a WeChat message:\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nIt was a message from Dr. Lin.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, feeling a bit ambivalent. To be honest, his feelings were complicated right now, because the reason Xu Le wanted to kill him was that this beautiful female doctor had been secretly in love with him.\n\nAlright, being secretly loved by a beautiful woman,\n\nbeing secretly loved by a beautiful marr... ied woman,\n\nbeing secretly loved by a beautiful married woman who was also still a virgin...\n\nIt was indeed something to be proud of.\n\nBut in his past life,\n\nit was her adoration that got him killed!!!!!\n\n\"At the store,\" Zhou Ze replied anyway.\n\nHe wasn't Xu Le; he wouldn't be so irresponsible. The karmic cycle between him and Xu Le had nothing to do with Dr. Lin.\n\nAnd frankly, after his death, as he gradually discovered the extent of Dr. Lin's infatuation with him, it was impossible for him to say he had no positive feelings for this woman.\n\nEspecially last week at the hospital, after his confession,\n\nshe was terrified,\n\nand panicked,\n\nher body was even trembling,\n\nbut she still embraced him without a moment's hesitation.\n\nWhether or not the heavens were blind, Zhou Ze didn't know, but Dr. Lin's existence was truly the biggest bright spot in his life since his rebirth.\n\n\"I'm on the road outside your store.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and scanned his surroundings. Sure enough, he spotted a white Maserati at the corner of the street.\n\nThe previous Cayenne had been scraped against a utility pole the night he drove it. Clearly, Dr. Lin had gotten another new car.\n\nAh, the evils of materialism!\n\nZhou Ze walked over, opened the car door, and sat down in the passenger seat.\n\nDr. Lin was a bit reserved and at a loss for what to do, but it was clear that she had summoned a great deal of courage to come see him.\n\nAfter all, he was a ghost.\n\n\"Xu Le, he's already...\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. He didn't want to hear anything about \"Xu Le\" right now.\n\n\"Don't mention him. Let's just pretend he never existed,\" Zhou Ze interrupted brusquely.\n\n\"Then... will that make you think... I'm a bad woman?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nThe Three Obediences and Four Virtues³...\n\nAlthough she wasn't so rigid and dogmatic, the fact was, Dr. Lin had been deeply poisoned by feudalistic ideas due to her parents' influence.\n\nNow, her husband was Zhou Ze.\n\nSo what about the original Xu Le?\n\n\"Don't overthink it.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nThe reality was just that comical.\n\nOnce Dr. Lin knew that Xu Le was Zhou Ze, her tone and posture had become much more subdued, as if she were back to being just an intern, and Zhou Ze was still her teacher.\n\nBack then, Zhou Ze had shown zero courtesy to his group of interns, male or female, treating them directly as \"intern slaves\" and making them do all the dirty work, heavy lifting, and coffee runs.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, after his confession, had also gradually started showing a \"one-cut-above\" attitude in front of Dr. Lin.\n\nHis chauvinistic tendencies were becoming more and more pronounced.\n\nThe one who is loved is always fearless.\n\n\"Okay,\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want silence. He looked at Dr. Lin and saw that she was wearing a pink down jacket and jeans. While her figure was perfectly accentuated and she looked genuinely beautiful with her temperament, Zhou Ze felt something was missing.\n\n\"Wear stockings next time. I like seeing women in stockings,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nDr. Lin froze for a moment, her pretty face flushing red.\n\nShe felt she ought to be sad. Having guessed that Xu Le was likely dead, she, as his wife, should be sad, not sitting in a car being teased by Zhou Ze.\n\nBut that feeling of mortified vexation left her unable to resist.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nshe really was a bad woman.\n\nA bad woman who had been having an emotional affair.\n\nDr. Lin closed her eyes, resigning herself to her fate.\n\n\"I'm talking to you,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Oh... okay,\" Dr. Lin replied, her face growing even redder.\n\nA smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nHe knew that the reason he was speaking so brazenly was partly out of a desire for revenge against Xu Le. Perhaps he wasn't a good man either.\n\nAlright, then.\n\nOne thought she wasn't a good woman, the other thought he wasn't a good man.\n\nIn ancient times, they would be a carbon copy of Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing.⁴\n\nAs for the Wu Dalang caught in the middle,\n\nwho cared?\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"Not hungry,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\nThen,\n\nmore silence.\n\nZhou Ze was now genuinely starting to think that his being single his entire past life wasn't just because he was obsessed with work with no time for anything else; it might be because his own emotional intelligence was just that low.\n\nIt's one thing to have conversations with strange girls always go cold, that's normal.\n\nBut for conversations with your own legal wife to also go cold, there was definitely something wrong with him.\n\n\"Let's just... live like this. Don't tell anyone about my situation. Just treat me as... Xu Le.\" Zhou Ze ground out those two words between his teeth.\n\n\"Okay,\" Dr. Lin nodded. This was what she wanted as well.\n\nEverything as it was.\n\n\"But there's one thing I need to remind you of.\"\n\n\"Please, tell me.\"\n\n\"When we're in bed, you're only allowed to call me Zhou Ze.\" Zhou Ze picked his ear with his pinky. \"I don't want to suddenly hear you call out the name Xu Le. When no one's around, you can only call my name too.\"\n\n*When we're in bed?*\n\nDr. Lin's heart suddenly skipped a beat.\n\nThough she had long been a wife, she was still a virgin.\n\nThis kind of topic and insinuation...\n\nwas truly mortifying!\n\nBut, as if possessed, she still nodded and softly replied,\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze really felt that this Dr. Lin had a bit of Stockholm Syndrome.\n\nIf the original Xu Le hadn't been so timid, but had been more simple and direct,\n\nhe probably would have gotten what he wanted, and then there'd be nothing left to benefit him.\n\nBut thinking about it from another angle, if Xu Le had been simple and direct, would he have still hated him enough to hire a hitman to kill him?\n\nSo which was better, getting a virgin Dr. Lin?\n\nOr continuing to live in his past life?\n\nWhich one was really better?\n\nZhou Ze reached up and slapped his own forehead.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze with concern. \"Your body... because of that incident... are there some problems?\"\n\n*Oh, for crying out loud.*\n\nShe was even using the formal \"you.\"\n\nMaster Zhou felt a wave of elation.\n\nThis Dr. Lin might not just have Stockholm Syndrome; she might be a masochist, too.\n\nNo, wait.\n\nHold on a second.\n\nSomething doesn't seem right.\n\n*Problems with his body?*\n\nZhou Ze immediately looked at Dr. Lin.\n\nHow could a man's body be allowed to have *problems*?\n\nNot possible!\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the car seats. It was a bit cramped up front.\n\n\"Get out of the car,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Hm.\"\n\nThough she didn't know what he was doing, Dr. Lin still got out of the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the back door, pointed inside, and said, \"Get in.\"\n\nLooking utterly baffled, Dr. Lin got in.\n\n\"I have to prove that I don't have a problem,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIt was already dark,\n\nand his bookstore was in a deserted area.\n\n\"But your appetite... isn't it bad?\" Dr. Lin asked from the back seat, completely puzzled.\n\nZhou Ze's body went stiff.\n\nThe \"problem with his body\" she was referring to was his inability to eat?\n\n*Phew...*\n\nHe let out a long breath,\n\nthe psychological pressure lifted.\n\nBut he was still going to charge ahead unburdened!\n\nStill, Zhou Ze said, \"I have to prove that another area has no problem either.\"\n\n\"What problem?\" Dr. Lin still looked confused.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze also slipped into the back seat,\n\nand closed the door.\n\nThe sky was dark.\n\nThe car was shaking.\n\nThey had a hell of a time.\n\n***\n\n¹ **The Honorable Lady Xu (許貴人):** `貴人` (guìrén) is a title for a high-ranking imperial consort in ancient China. The narrator uses this as a sarcastic nickname for the effeminate and dramatic Xu Qinglang.\n\n² **Waterway/Dry Road (水路/旱道):** This is a crude double-entendre. \"Waterway's blocked\" (`水路不通`) is a euphemism for being constipated. \"Take the dry road\" (`走旱道`) is a slang term for anal sex.

    "content": "\"They're in the car.\"\n\nAt the entrance to the bookstore, Bai Yingying sat on a small stool, staring at the Maserati in the distance.\n\n\"Sigh, a Maserati doesn't really have as much space as a Cayenne. I remember she drove a Cayenne last time, right?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was also sitting on a small stool at the entrance to his noodle shop.\n\n\"The boss scraped it while driving, so she probably switched cars.\"\n\nOriginally, the two were minding their own business, but alas, the female corpse was no ordinary person. As an existence that had once lain buried for two hundred years, her hearing was truly excellent.\n\nDuring those two hundred years, Lady Bai would occasionally come to chat with her, telling her about the world outside, just like close girlfriends.\n\nYes, just like how girls in a university dorm will sometimes gather to discuss matters of length and hardness, or watch educational action films from a certain Eastern country¹ together.\n\nBecause of this, although the female corpse hadn't been out in two hundred years, she hadn't fallen out of touch with the times. When Lady Bai wasn't around, she would listen to the sounds within the earth and on its surface, and as a result, she had honed an incredibly terrifying sense of hearing.\n\nWhen she \"heard\" the plot beginning to slide in an unspeakable direction, she immediately brought her stool over to sit, simultaneously patting the wall to signal Xu Qinglang next door to come out and watch the show with her.\n\nIt had to be said, although the two of them bickered a bit much on a normal basis, at critical moments, they still knew how to share.\n\n\"Whoa, the boss is getting out,\" Bai Yingying exclaimed in a low voice.\n\n\"Huh, that doctor is getting out too,\" Xu Qinglang reported, like a live broadcast.\n\n\"Whoa, the boss opened the back door,\" Bai Yingying continued in a low voice.\n\n\"Huh, that doctor is getting into the back seat,\" Xu Qinglang continued his live broadcast.\n\n\"The car is shaking,\" Bai Yingying covered her mouth, her eyes fixed on the scene without blinking.\n\n\"They must be having a great time,\" Xu Qinglang took a deep breath.\n\n\"The air is filled with a sour smell. Did the sour plum juice in your kitchen leak?\" The female corpse waved a hand in front of her nose.\n\n\"Heh, bullshit. Come on, let's place our bets. How long till it's over?\" Xu Qinglang looked at his watch. \"I bet ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Fifteen minutes!\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"One, two, three, four... eight, nine, ten seconds!\"\n\n*Ahem*, pay attention to the unit of time.\n\n\"Huh, the car stopped shaking,\" the female corpse said curiously.\n\n\"Could they be changing positions?\" Xu Qinglang frowned, unwilling to believe that terrible conclusion!\n\n\"Changing positions in ten seconds?\" The female corpse giggled. \"You must be a greenhorn too, huh?\"\n\nThe female corpse was an experienced woman. Back then, when Lady Bai had her trysts with the poor scholar and tasted the forbidden fruit, she had been there. She had experience.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression turned unhappy. As a man who owned over twenty properties, was it so wrong for him to place a little more importance on his first time?\n\n\"The car's moving again!\" Xu Qinglang exclaimed.\n\n\"One, two, three, four... eight, nine, ten seconds!\"\n\n\"It stopped again.\" Bai Yingying sniffled. \"Changing positions again?\"\n\n\"Your boss, was he never married before?\" Xu Qinglang frowned. \"Wait, I think I checked Zhou Ze's file. It said 'unmarried.' Don't tell me he's a virgin?\"\n\n\"He probably hasn't been married,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"That doctor's brow isn't 'opened,'² and her thighs are held close together. She should also be a virgin.\" Xu Qinglang slapped his forehead. \"Hahahaha, this is killing me, I get it now! Two virgins, trying something so high-class for their first time.\"\n\nBai Yingying remained silent beside him.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I remember, when the Madam and that scholar had their first time, the scholar seemed very skilled,\" Bai Yingying said, a bit wistfully.\n\n\"Those ancient sour-faced scholars were all cunning devils who loved to deceive you young ladies from good families. In reality, they're all shameless old drivers.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had an air of someone who had seen through the mortal world. \"Holy crap, the car's moving again.\"\n\nTen seconds, stop.\n\nTen seconds, move.\n\nTen seconds, stop.\n\nTen seconds, move.\n\nEvery time the car moved, the female corpse and Xu Qinglang would tilt their heads to one side. When the car moved again, they would tilt them back.\n\nBy the end, both of them felt their necks getting a little sore.\n\nFinally, the back door opened.\n\nZhou Ze and Doctor Lin got out, drenched in sweat. Then, they each got into the front seats.\n\n\"I just don't get it,\" Xu Qinglang shook his head.\n\n\"Me neither,\" Bai Yingying also looked baffled.\n\n\"Could it be that Zhou Ze's rhythm is different from ordinary people's?\" Xu Qinglang shook his head again.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Bai Yingying guessed.\n\nFinally, the Maserati drove away. The excitement was over.\n\nXu Qinglang and Bai Yingying glanced at each other, snorted, and mentally scorned the other as a \"pervert!\"\n\nThen they turned their heads and went their separate ways, one to the kitchen, one to her books.\n\n...\n\n\"Hah... hah...\"\n\nIn the passenger seat, Zhou Ze was panting heavily, the hair on his forehead already soaked with sweat.\n\nDoctor Lin was driving the car, also beaded with sweat, which only added to her charm.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's my fault. I'm not attractive enough,\" Doctor Lin bit her lip, blaming herself. \"I don't have any experience, I don't understand this sort of thing, so you... couldn't enjoy yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned his head back and shook it.\n\n\"It's my fault. With things like that, it must be my fault.\"\n\nZhou Ze pulled out a tissue from the front and wiped his damp hair.\n\n\"We're both doctors. We actually understand this matter. It's me, I really have a problem in this area.\" Zhou Ze took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\nRight now, he wished he could go straight back, drag Xu Qinglang out, and whip him a hundred times while he was hung from a tree!\n\nJust a moment ago, Zhou Ze had suddenly remembered what Xu Qinglang had said to him.\n\n*You're using Xu Le's body.*\n\n*So are you cuckolding Xu Le, or is Xu Le cuckolding you?*\n\n*Your body is Xu Le's, the DNA is Xu Le's, and the child would be Xu Le's.*\n\nNormally, he didn't think much of it.\n\nBut at that moment, Zhou Ze even found the thing below his waist a little disgusting, as if he were holding someone else's.\n\nUnder this kind of psychological pressure, after trying many times, he had finally surpassed Yu the Great in accomplishment.\n\nUtterly insincere!³\n\n\"Give me some time.\" Zhou Ze lit a cigarette, then thought for a moment and threw it out the window.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze felt it was impolite to smoke in a lady's car, but rather that he didn't feel he was qualified to have a post-coital cigarette.\n\n\"Next time, I'll wear stockings,\" Lin Wanqiu said very seriously.\n\n\"Then that would completely prove that it's my problem,\" Zhou Ze said with a bitter smile. But looking at the very solemn expression on Doctor Lin's face beside him, Zhou Ze's heart softened.\n\nHe even felt that he was being a bit of a bastard, for having unloaded some of the anger he had just been feeling onto this woman.\n\n*I'm sorry*, Zhou Ze said in his heart.\n\nNo matter how complicated his relationship of hatred with Xu Le was, at least this woman was innocent. Her feelings for him were also very pure.\n\nIn his last life, he had seemed very successful, but half a year after his death, it seemed she was the only one who still remembered him.\n\n\"Just stop up ahead. You should go back and get some sleep early tonight,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You should also rest early,\" Lin Wanqiu said as she stopped the car.\n\nOnly after Zhou Ze got out did she drive away.\n\nZhou Ze had said before that they should maintain their lifestyles as they were, business as usual.\n\nAnd it was impossible not to. Even if Zhou Ze were willing to go back and face the long faces of his father-in-law, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law, he wouldn't be able to sleep lying in the same bed as Doctor Lin at night.\n\nWas he supposed to ask Doctor Lin to sleep in the freezer with him?\n\nHe wouldn't freeze to death, but what about Doctor Lin?\n\nOr maybe call Bai Yingying over so they could all sleep together?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't that much of an animal yet.\n\nEating and sleeping, the two greatest matters in life, were both restricted for him now. It was truly difficult to let himself go.\n\nThe Wen Miao had closed its gates long ago; it wasn't like that time during the \"gate washing\" when everyone was jostling to be the first to offer incense.\n\nThe Chinese have always been so utilitarian when it comes to gods and spirits. Of course, this also seemed to be a kind of virtue.\n\nZhou Ze opened the pack of cigarettes he had brought.\n\nAlthough there had been a little interruption along the way, Zhou Ze still knew what he had to do.\n\nNo matter what, he couldn't just wait around for the little loli to finish her business and come back to erase his temporary worker status, with his own fate depending on her mood.\n\nHe planted the cigarettes in a row on the ground, lit them one by one, and then laid out the *tangyuan*.⁴ After doing all this, Zhou Ze cupped his hands in front of him and called out:\n\n\"This young one has brought some things to honor you, sir. I beseech you to show yourself.\"\n\nAfter he spoke, he waited for a long time, but there was still no sound.\n\nZhou Ze unwrapped another carton of cigarettes. As he was about to light them, he noticed that the long row he had just lit had suddenly been extinguished all at once.\n\nLifting his head, Zhou Ze saw the dwarf elder sitting on a mound of earth up ahead, his pockets bulging, grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"Young fellow, you're bearing gifts for no reason, aren't you?\"\n\nThe dwarf elder, with a gong on his back, had a face full of wrinkles.\n\n\"I do indeed have something to ask you,\" Zhou Ze said, his posture very humble.\n\nTo be able to lead patrols around Wen Miao, he definitely wasn't some lonely ghost, but probably someone within the system. Therefore, he should know a lot about matters concerning underworld emissaries.\n\n\"Don't you worry, let this old man do some calculations.\" The elder pinched his fingers, looking at Zhou Ze with a meaningful expression, and mused, \"This old man has served at Wen Miao for a full sixty-year cycle, so I have some skill. Whatever you're seeking or desiring in your heart, this old man can definitely figure it out.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze waited quietly by the side.\n\nFinally, the elder slapped his thigh and said:\n\n\"I've figured it out!\"\n\n\"I implore the senior to enlighten me,\" Zhou Ze asked respectfully.\n\n*This underworld emissary identity of mine, how do I remove the 'temporary' prefix?*\n\n*And where on earth should I go from here?*\n\nThe elder chuckled, \"Heh heh,\" wearing an expression that said *I've seen right through you*, as if everything was under his control.\n\nHe leisurely stroked his beard and said, \"I already know what you desire most. So be it. Seeing as you've been so courteous this time, this old man will point you toward a clear path.\"\n\nZhou Ze waited earnestly.\n\n\"Jiuzhitang's Concentrated Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills,\"⁵ the elder said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Huh, that's not it? It can't be. That stuff's a 300-year-old quality brand; this old man took it when I was young and alive, it works!\"\n\nAt that very moment, Zhou Ze suddenly had the urge to strangle the smug old man in front of him.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Educational action films from a certain Eastern country:** A common euphemism for Japanese Adult Videos (JAV).\n2.  **Brow isn't 'opened':** A reference to folk physiognomy, suggesting someone who lacks worldly or sexual experience.\n3.  **Surpassed Yu the Great... Utterly insincere!:** A complex joke. Yu the Great was a legendary Chinese ruler famous for his dedication to flood control, a story says he passed his own home three times without entering. The joke here is a sexual innuendo: Zhou Ze, in his repeated failures to \"enter,\" has surpassed Yu. The phrase \"Utterly insincere!\" is a sarcastic comment on his body's failure to perform despite his intentions.\n4.  ***Tangyuan***: Sweet glutinous rice balls, often used as offerings.\n5.  **Jiuzhitang's Concentrated Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills:** A real brand of traditional Chinese medicine often marketed for treating kidney-yin deficiency, which in popular culture is associated with improving male virility.",

    "content": "\"Uh, could I have guessed wrong?\"\n\nThe dwarf elder tilted his head.\n\n\"My skills have regressed again, oh dear.\"\n\nThe dwarf elder took out a cigarette and started smoking by himself, looking quite melancholic.\n\nZhou Ze composed himself. He couldn't very well say, *There might actually be some truth to your calculation, you know?*\n\n\"Old senior, I came to ask about the matter of Ghost Emissaries.\"\n\n\"Ghost Emissaries?\" The dwarf elder frowned. \"I say, young man, what are you doing asking about Ghost Emissaries for no reason? That bunch isn't easy to get along with. If you run into them, you'd best steer clear.\n\nYou have a physical body, you were able to come back to life—that's a great karmic opportunity. You should just be enjoying it in secret.\"\n\nThe elder said, utterly perplexed.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. *The elder before me can't tell I'm a Ghost Emissary?*\n\nEven though he was a temp, judging by the divination skills the elder had just displayed, he was definitely no half-baked amateur. Yet he hadn't detected his identity as a Ghost Emissary at all.\n\nDid this mean that the little loli really did just see him as a temp, and that besides the so-called \"Gate of Hell,\" there were other important things she hadn't given him?\n\nXu Qinglang had once said that the loli came and went in a hurry; she definitely wasn't just there to hand over the post. She had things she needed to attend to and had simply grabbed him to serve as free labor for the time being.\n\nAs for the reason she grabbed him to be her grunt, it was simple enough, wasn't it? She valued the fact that he wouldn't proactively stir up trouble and cause her problems while he was covering her shift.\n\nBut this identity was something Zhou Ze had to master. His first life had already been destroyed; this time, he had to have his life completely in his own hands. The identity of a Ghost Emissary was the best protective talisman, preventing him from becoming an undocumented soul, living in constant fear.\n\nZhou Ze opened his palm to the elder, revealing the insignia.\n\nThe elder's expression immediately froze. His breathing hitched for a moment, and his eyes darted around. Then, as if hit by a sudden realization, he said:\n\n\"I get it. That long-tongued girl pulled you out to be her replacement.\"\n\nThe dwarf elder clasped his hands behind his back and paced back and forth on the mound of earth, seeming to ponder some question. Zhou Ze stood by his side, not making a sound to disturb him.\n\nFinally, the elder asked again, \"You ask me, an old man, about Ghost Emissaries. What is your intention?\"\n\n\"To better contribute my strength to the harmony of Hell and the peace of the mortal world.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" The elder shook his head, then nodded. \"Heh, I know what you want to do. You want to replace that long-tongued girl, don't you?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't refute it.\n\nNot refuting it meant tacit agreement.\n\n\"It's not that there isn't a way. In fact, it's very simple,\" the dwarf elder mused. \"On account of all the gifts you brought me tonight, I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"I'm all ears.\"\n\n\"Inside the Confucian Temple dwell the Sages. With the Sages above, humans walk the path of mortals, and ghosts cross the Bridge of Helplessness. The Sages see all with a single glance.\n\nTell me, does that not make sense?\"\n\n\"It does.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"That long-tongued girl gave you this key, which is equivalent to giving you half an identity, but she can take it back at any time,\" the dwarf elder mused. \"But as long as you enter the Confucian Temple, and I personally pray to the Sages, and you state your case before them, make some guarantees, show your resolve.\n\nIn other words, say all those fine-sounding words you said before, but make them sound even finer. As long as one of the Sages nods in approval, your status will be solidified.\n\nBut there is one thing you must remember: the Sages' gaze is like a torch, seeing through everything. If you harbor malicious thoughts, or if you do anything out of line in the future, you will be punished not only by the laws of the Underworld, but also by the wrath of the Sages!\"\n\nThe dwarf elder wore a solemn expression.\n\n\"Is it that simple?\" Zhou Ze asked in return.\n\n\"How could it be simple?\" The dwarf elder sighed. \"To gain the favor of the Sages and have them grant you this status... this is merely one method, a method to at least try.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Then let's try.\"\n\nThe dwarf elder walked to the entrance of the Confucian Temple and blew a breath of air towards it. A \"clack\" sounded from behind the door; it must have been the bolt of the great red wooden doors falling into place.\n\n\"You go on in first. Speak your piece properly before the statues of the Sages. I will take care of the rest for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pushed the door open. He looked at the dwarf elder beside him, who stood there without moving, and asked, a little puzzled:\n\n\"Old senior, aren't you coming in with me?\"\n\n\"You jest. I am but a stray dog at the feet of the Sages. How would I dare to carelessly show my face before them? You, on the other hand, possess half an official title. Go on in.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, but still stepped forward and went inside.\n\nThe elder brought his hands together lightly, and the wooden doors closed once more.\n\n\"Have a good long talk with the Sages!\"\n\nThen, the elder took out another cigarette and stuck it in his mouth. It didn't need to be lit; the cigarette simply ignited on its own.\n\nAfter finishing the cigarette, the elder smiled, took down his gong, and struck it with force!\n\nA sharp clang rang out.\n\nThe elder strained his throat and shouted:\n\n\"The air is dry and things are parched, be careful of fire and candles!\"\n\nImmediately after,\n\nanother clang of the gong:\n\n\"The air is dry and things are parched, be careful of fire and candles!\"\n\nThe elder struck the gong, singing and dancing in front of the Confucian Temple, somewhat like a Northeastern shaman performing a ritual dance.¹\n\nHis short stature made his hopping and jumping seem all the more endearingly clumsy.\n\n\"Kid, you keep talking to the statues of the Sages, state your case, and I'll help your words reach the heavens!\"\n\nThe dwarf elder shouted towards the temple.\n\n\"Alright. Thank you for your trouble, senior.\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice came from behind the wall.\n\n\"No trouble, no trouble at all. Just bring me a few more cartons of cigarettes and come visit me from time to time. My family line has ended, I have no descendants to burn incense for me. It's hard enough just to get a smoke these days.\n\nThe Confucian Temple isn't short on food or drink, but I wouldn't dare touch the things set before the Sage masters even if you gave me ten times the courage.\"\n\nThe dwarf elder laughed, \"Hahaha,\"\n\nand then continued to cheerfully beat his gong.\n\n\"The air is dry and things are parched, be careful of fire and candles!\"\n\n*BANG!* The gong rang out!\n\n\"The air is dry and things are parched, be careful of fire and candles!\"\n\n*BANG!* The gong rang out.\n\nThe sound of the gong grew deeper and deeper with each strike.\n\nAt the same time, the mallet, which had been wrapped in white cloth, began to be soaked through with the color of blood.\n\nAt first,\n\nthe blood was just a few faint specks, but as he struck the gong again and again, the color began to spread.\n\nIt grew thicker, and it grew more lurid.\n\nIn the end,\n\nwith every strike, the dwarf elder splattered a large spray of blood plasma, staining his clothes and lending a grim ferocity to his once endearingly clumsy appearance!\n\n\"The air is dry and things are parched, be! care! ful! of! fire! and! can! dles!\"\n\n*BANG!*\n\nWith the final clang of the gong,\n\nthe dwarf elder flung the blood-red, gore-covered instrument straight into the Confucian Temple. At the same time, he shrieked:\n\n\"The Sages open their eyes! The evil spirit receives its judgment!\"\n\nAfter shouting this last line,\n\nthe elder's entire being seemed to be struck by lightning. His body became much blurrier than before, even showing faint signs of dissipating.\n\nBut he still laughed wildly, shouting towards the inside:\n\n\"How does it feel? Are you comfortable now?!\"\n\n\"Not comfortable.\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice came from behind the surrounding wall.\n\n\"Not comfortable is right! Young man, today I'll teach you another lesson: that the ways of the world are fickle, and the human heart is hard to fathom!\n\nA person's heart is hidden behind their belly, let alone the heart of a ghost!\n\nI'm giving up a full sixty years of merit from my servitude just to have the Sages suppress and kill you!\"\n\n\"Do I... have a grudge with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice came from the other side of the wall, thick with confusion.\n\n\"A grudge? Of course there's a grudge!\" The dwarf elder's body flickered, but he continued to shout, \"I forsook reincarnation, I abandoned the cycle of rebirth, I did not move on to the next life!\n\nDay and night, I served in this Confucian Temple, waiting on these ancestors,\n\nand for what?\n\nWas it not to accumulate some underworld merit for my descendants, to bless my family line!\n\nMy lineage, due to an ancestor's past transgressions, has always been thin. That's why I had no choice but to remain here, praying only that the incense of my family line would not be extinguished!\n\nBut one year ago, my last descendant, my only descendant, was gone!\n\nTell me, what was the point of my sixty years of servitude, of playing the grandson?\"\n\nThe dwarf elder cried out,\n\n\"Is it fun keeping these clay statues company every day?\n\nHahaha, the heavens have eyes! That day during the 'Door Washing'² scramble for the first incense, I only glanced at you, bummed a cigarette off you.\n\nI didn't see anything at all.\n\nBut today, when I did a proper calculation... to hell with your Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills!³\n\nYou let me calculate that you are inextricably linked to the premature death of my last descendant!\n\nThis is the cause you created, so today you will bear the consequence!\n\nI'm trading sixty years of merit from my servitude for your soul to be shattered and scattered!\n\nIt's worth it for you! You're not getting a raw deal!\"\n\n\"Your descendant, did he die on the operating table?\" Zhou Ze asked from behind the wall.\n\n\"No, not on the operating table. He died in a car crash.\"\n\nThe dwarf elder said, wiping away tears. Though his form was blurry, his tears also seemed to carry flecks of red.\n\n\"That drunk driving bastard, he should have died! His destined time was up! But you, you saved him on that operating table, forcefully extending his life by half a month!\n\nIn the end, his time came, he died driving drunk in a car crash, but he dragged my adorable great-great-great-grandson down with him, who also died in that crash.\n\nTell me,\n\nis this not your karma?\n\nIs this not the evil you wrought?\n\nIs this not a debt you owe!\"\n\n\"That's some powerful mental gymnastics,\" Zhou Ze remarked with a sigh.\n\nThe dwarf elder, slowly calming down from his initial state of vengeful euphoria, suddenly realized something extremely strange. Logically speaking, he had sacrificed a full sixty years of merit from his servitude to ask one of the Sages in the Confucian Temple to open his eyes once.\n\nGiven the usual damn-lazy nature of those clay Sages, they were utterly idle on a normal day. As long as a ghost was present when they opened their eyes, they would suppress and kill it on the spot, even a fully-fledged Ghost Emissary, let alone a temp like Zhou Ze.\n\nRight now, shouldn't Zhou Ze's soul be breaking apart under the Sage's gaze, his spirit scattering, suffering immense pain?\n\nHow could he sound so relaxed every time he replied?\n\nThis wasn't right.\n\nThis wasn't right at all!\n\n\"How are you alright? How can you be alright!\"\n\nThe dwarf elder suddenly roared.\n\nHe had thrown away a full sixty years of merit from his servitude!\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the other side of the surrounding wall,\n\nlooking at the dwarf elder.\n\nThe Confucian Temple was enclosed by a rectangular wall. When Zhou Ze had been speaking earlier, he was standing on the outside of the opposite wall, so to the dwarf elder standing at the main gate, it sounded as if Zhou Ze were inside the temple, responding to him.\n\nThe dwarf elder was completely stunned, as if struck by lightning. He stared in utter disbelief at Zhou Ze, who had appeared outside the Confucian Temple.\n\n\"How are you outside? How did you get out!\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured with his chin towards the back and said:\n\n\"You've been working at this establishment for so long,\n\nand you didn't know you could use the back door?\"\n\n---\n¹ A folk shamanistic ritual from Northeastern China, often characterized by energetic dancing and chanting.\n² Refers to a previous event where people were competing to offer the first incense of the day at a temple, a ritual believed to bring great luck.\n³ A common Traditional Chinese Medicine patent formula. The elder's exclamation is a non-sequitur, used here as a strange, exasperated curse.",

    "content": "\"You've been kicking around this unit for so long...\n\n...and you didn't know there's actually a back door you can use?\"\n\nThe back door here didn't refer to the unwritten rule of using personal connections, but to the fact that, besides the front gate, the Temple of Confucius did indeed have a back door.\n\nIn this world, there's no such thing as love without reason. And if meat pies were to fall from the sky, according to mechanical calculations, they could certainly kill someone.\n\nIf the dwarf elder had only given him a few pointers and uttered some cryptic, mysterious words, like the sage in the story who gave the Monkey King three secret knocks on the head, Zhou Ze might have actually considered it carefully, finding it more believable and solid.\n\nBut the strange thing was that the dwarf elder was just too enthusiastic—so enthusiastic that Zhou Ze felt it was unreal.\n\nCould it be that in recent years, a trend of learning from Lei Feng¹ and doing good deeds had started among ghosts?\n\nEspecially after the elder refused to enter the Temple of Confucius with him, Zhou Ze became a bit more cautious and wary. The temple wasn't very large; Zhou Ze went in through the main gate and immediately slipped out the back to circle around.\n\nAs it turned out, Zhou Ze's choice was the correct one.\n\nJust as the elder himself had said, even with people, their hearts are hidden from view, so how could you trust a ghost?\n\nFurthermore, what Zhou Ze found somewhat absurd was the reason the elder wanted revenge on him. It was because...\n\nHe had saved a patient, and then half a month later, that patient caused a car accident while drunk driving, which also led to the death of the dwarf elder's grandson in the same crash.\n\nThe dwarf elder had actually redirected his anger onto him, believing that if he hadn't done everything in his power to save that patient's life back then, his grandson wouldn't have died.\n\nWhat a bizarre train of thought.\n\n\"I was a doctor in my past life. Curing the sick and saving the dying was my duty,\" Zhou Ze said with a slight smile. \"I don't think I did anything wrong. For you to hate me, to hate me to this extent, is truly unreasonable.\n\n\"Perhaps you're just bitter that your family line has been severed, that your sixty years of service to this clay statue have amounted to nothing, and you just want to find someone to vent your frustrations on. So you chose me?\"\n\nThe dwarf elder stared viciously at Zhou Ze, licked his lips, and said in a hoarse voice:\n\n\"This is the sin you created! Why did you have to save a man who was supposed to die!\"\n\n\"In a doctor's eyes, only those who die despite our best efforts are considered dead. I don't accept your reasoning. That so-called karma of yours is utter bullshit.\"\n\nIf he had to bear the karmic responsibility for every crime committed by the people he saved, wouldn't that be the most absurd joke in the world?\n\nZhou Ze remembered reading a memoir by an old British soldier who wrote that during World War I, he had personally captured the Führer. He had the chance to turn a blind eye and have the short man shot, but he didn't, instead taking him in as a prisoner of war.\n\nWas the old British soldier to be held responsible for all the evils committed by the Third Reich later on?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. There was no reasoning with this guy. The next moment, the nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers began to lengthen, and a black aura swirled around his fingertips.\n\n\"Are you going to send the young to their doom and take the old out with them too?\" the dwarf elder shrieked in a panic. \"This is the Temple of Confucius, the resting place of the Sage! Even an official Netherworld Emissary wouldn't dare act so presumptuously here!\"\n\n\"Fuck you.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked straight toward the dwarf elder.\n\n\"I live by one principle: you just tried to kill me, so now I'm going to kill you!\"\n\nVengeance from his past life wasn't convenient to seek right now, but if he just let this present-day grievance slide, then Zhou Ze's temper would be far too good!\n\nHe couldn't mess with the living for the time being, but he couldn't mess with a ghost?\n\nThe dwarf elder tried to flee, but Zhou Ze's hand shot out and grabbed him, yanking him back forcefully!\n\n*Shhhlick!*\n\nThe dwarf elder let out a blood-curdling scream, his body turning even more transparent.\n\n\"I don't want to go to Hell! I don't want to go to Hell! Sage, save me, save me!\"\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nThe clay statues in the Temple of Confucius remained as still as mountains. If they truly possessed spirits, how could they have allowed the dwarf elder's family line to be completely extinguished?\n\n\"Who said I was sending you to Hell?\" Zhou Ze smirked. \"You think you still have the chance to go to Hell?\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze lunged forward, then tore his hands apart. The pent-up ferocity in his heart erupted at that moment, and the dwarf elder's soul-form completely disintegrated!\n\nIt was simple.\n\nAnd clean.\n\nBefore dealing with Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze hadn't known he was that capable a fighter.\n\nBut now, he had a solid confidence in his own strength, especially his abilities against ghostly beings. Although, the ease with which the dwarf elder was dispatched had a lot to do with him having sacrificed sixty years of merit and service, leaving his soul-form weak.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know if there would be any repercussions for what he had just done, nor was he sure if denying the old man even the chance to go to Hell was in line with the little loli's \"know your damn limits\" philosophy.\n\nBut if he always bottled things up like a turtle, he felt it would eventually cause problems for him.\n\nBrushing the dust off his shoulder, Zhou Ze took out his phone and called a cab.\n\nAfter getting in the car, the driver was very friendly and even offered Zhou Ze a cigarette. This left Zhou Ze feeling \"pleasantly surprised\" for a moment. Then, while smoking and making small talk with the driver,\n\nhe also secretly touched the burning cigarette tip to the car door.\n\nThe door wasn't burned through.\n\nZhou Ze felt a sense of relief. He was truly worn out from the last encounter with a paper car.\n\nIt was already one in the morning by the time he got back to the bookstore. Bai Yingying was sitting behind the counter, staring at the computer and manipulating the mouse with some difficulty.\n\nAfter taking a shower and changing his clothes, Zhou Ze was about to head upstairs to rest when he noticed Bai Yingying was still sitting motionless behind the computer.\n\nHow was he supposed to sleep if she didn't go up?\n\nZhou Ze walked up behind Bai Yingying and discovered that the female corpse was actually playing the single-player game *Beach Head*, and she was completely engrossed in it.\n\n\"Time to rest,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Oh,\" Bai Yingying replied, not really processing what he'd said.\n\n\"I said, it's time to rest,\" Zhou Ze repeated, his voice firmer.\n\n\"Oh, okay!\" Bai Yingying stuck out her tongue, exited the game, and obediently went upstairs.\n\nThere were two sleeping mats on the second floor. The freezer had been temporarily moved to a corner. Each of them lay down on a mat. If an outsider were to accidentally come upstairs, they might think they were looking at two corpses laid out on straw mats.\n\n\"Boss, you must be... tired today, right?\" Bai Yingying asked tentatively.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. He didn't want to say much about the night's events, especially the part about passing by his old home multiple times without going in. It wasn't exactly something to brag about.\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze was ignoring her, Bai Yingying obediently closed her eyes. A faint Yin energy began to radiate from her body, causing the surrounding temperature to drop and allowing Zhou Ze's mind to slowly relax.\n\nMmm,\n\nTime to sleep.\n\n***\n\n*Gurgle... gurgle... gurgle...*\n\nIt sounded like boiling water.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes and found himself floating on a pool of water. Waves of heat rolled around him, as if he were lying in a large bathhouse pool.\n\nIn the distance, there was a very wide but muddy road, and groups of white figures were trudging along it numbly.\n\nThis place... felt so familiar.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat up, discovering that he could actually sit on the water's surface without sinking.\n\n\"You're here too.\"\n\nA man's voice sounded beside Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze whipped his head around and only then saw a young man in a hoodie standing next to him.\n\nBeside the man in the hoodie, a small figure was crouched, looking like a cat.\n\nThe man was wearing his hood up, so Zhou Ze couldn't see his face clearly, but he gave off a very familiar feeling.\n\nHe just couldn't place who it was at the moment.\n\n\"Don't be nervous. This is a dream,\" the man in the hoodie said. \"Zhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly. For us dead people, dreaming our way back to Hell is a common occurrence.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Does a name have any meaning here?\"\n\nThe man retorted.\n\nZhou Ze was at a loss for words. Indeed, the man in the hoodie had made it clear: only the dead dream their way back to Hell. Since they were all already dead, what was the point of exchanging names?\n\n\"They're coming to get me,\" the man in the hoodie said.\n\n\"Get you?\" Zhou Ze was taken aback. \"Get you and take you back to Hell?\"\n\n\"Heh...\" the man in the hoodie chuckled.\n\nThen, he turned to leave, and the cat by his side slowly began to follow him.\n\nSuddenly, something clicked in Zhou Ze's mind. \"Are you that guy from Rongcheng?\" he called out.\n\n\"The old Daoist's employee from the Underworld Store?\"\n\nThe man in the hoodie stopped and turned his head to look at Zhou Ze. \"Employee?\"\n\n\"Am I... wrong?\"\n\n\"I suppose that's what I am. You know that old Daoist?\" the man asked.\n\n\"I guess you could say that,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh.\" The man in the hoodie gestured around them. The white mist was growing thicker. \"The dream is about to end,\" he said.\n\n\"This is my first time having a dream like this,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You'll get used to it, slowly.\" Seemingly because of Zhou Ze's connection to the old Daoist, the man in the hoodie seemed willing to talk a bit more and didn't rush to leave. He pointed to the pool beneath their feet. \"Remember this pool?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked down and nodded.\n\n\"Get down!\"\n\nThe man in the hoodie walked over to Zhou Ze, placed a hand on his shoulder, and then both of them sank into the water.\n\nThe pool water was incredibly clear, and the visibility was high.\n\n\"Notice anything... missing?\" the man in the hoodie asked.\n\n\"That... that woman... is gone.\"\n\nZhou Ze scanned the surroundings of the pool and noticed the problem. The faceless woman he had encountered during his first trip to Hell was gone!\n\n\"Oh,\" the man in the hoodie responded. Then, Zhou Ze saw two glints of red appear from under the man's hood. They were his eyes.\n\nBlood-red eyes!\n\nIn an instant, an overwhelming sense of dread began to wash over him.\n\nA terrible sense of crisis suddenly descended.\n\nThe nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers grew out, and a black halo appeared in his eyes.\n\n\"What are you trying to do?\" Zhou Ze asked, on guard.\n\nThe man in the hoodie smiled and pointed at him. \"Look at yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked down at his body.\n\nHe was stunned to find\n\nthat he was wrapped in layer upon layer of black hair. He hadn't even noticed when this hair had appeared.\n\n\"She has already come for you,\" the man in the hoodie warned.\n\n***\n\nThe early morning sun gave off a warm, lazy feeling. Xu Qinglang made a cup of tea, moved a rattan chair to the front of his shop, and basked in the sun. No one would be ordering takeout this early, so he was happy to enjoy the peace and quiet.\n\nA taxi stopped at the intersection ahead, and a girl who looked like a high school student got out.\n\nThe girl was very pretty, with a hint of baby fat on her face. She was already on her way to becoming a real beauty.\n\nThe girl walked up to the bookstore, saw that it was locked, and promptly kicked the door.\n\n\"Xu Le, you bastard, get out here!\"\n\nBut there was no response.\n\nXu Qinglang took a sip of his tea. \"What do you need him for?\"\n\n\"My sister's been on sick leave for over a week, locking herself in her room all day, not eating or drinking. It must be that bastard Xu Le who made my sister angry again!\n\n\"I'm here today to drag him back to apologize to my sister.\"\n\n\"Your sister?\" Xu Qinglang started to get the picture. \"Your sister must have been pretty tired last night, huh?\"\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" the little sister-in-law asked with a frown.\n\n\"Nothing. Little kids shouldn't meddle in adult relationships. Just worry about your own little boyfriend,\" Xu Qinglang said, taking on the tone of someone lecturing a young girl.\n\n\"You're a weird one. Don't think I won't smack you just because you're handsome!\n\n\"Is our family's business any of your business?\"\n\nThe little sister-in-law raised her hand, signaling, *I'm really gonna smack you!*\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed and said leisurely, \"Don't worry, your sister and your brother-in-law's relationship is just fine.\"\n\nThere was another sentence Xu Qinglang didn't say out loud, but thought to himself: *Doctor Lin seems like such a traditional woman, who knew she could be so open-minded.*\n\n*To overcome her emotional baggage and embrace a new life so quickly...*\n\n*Tsk, tsk.*\n\n*Truly, the power of love is mighty and irrational. Throughout history, how many lovesick fools have thrown themselves like moths into this flame called love.*\n\n\"What are you trying to say?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Fine, here's a little tip. Tell your sister that her Cayenne has more space than that white Maserati. It's more comfortable for... doing things inside.\"\n\n\"Maserati?\" the little sister-in-law asked, confused.\n\n\"Yeah, isn't it your sister's new car?\"\n\n\"My sister hasn't left the house in over a week. Where would she get a new car, let alone a Maserati?\"\n\nThe little sister-in-law looked at Xu Qinglang with bewilderment, then, as if realizing something, she kicked the bookstore door again.\n\n\"Aha, Xu Le, I get it now!\n\n\"You eat our family's food,\n\n\"You use our family's things,\n\n\"My sister even paid for you to open this bookstore,\n\n\"And now that you've got your wings, you've gone and latched onto another rich woman, is that it?\n\n\"And that rich woman even drives a Maserati to pick you up for dates, right?!\n\n\"Xu Le, you're biting the hand that feeds you! You're heartless!\"\n\n*Clatter!*\n\nA crisp sound rang out.\n\nThe little sister-in-law jumped in fright.\n\nShe turned her head to look at Xu Qinglang, who was lying in the rattan chair beside her.\n\nThe sound had come from the teacup slipping from Xu Qinglang's hand and shattering on the ground.\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth hung open, his face a mask of horror.\n\nThen he leaped from the rattan chair\n\nand began kicking the bookstore door wildly:\n\n\"Goddamn you!\n\n\"Wake the fuck up!\n\n\"Still sleeping your ass off?!\n\n\"You were really with a ghost last night!\"\n\n---\n¹ **Lei Feng**: A soldier in the People's Liberation Army of China who became a posthumous national icon, praised for his selflessness and devotion to the Communist Party. \"Learning from Lei Feng\" is a common phrase encouraging altruism.",
